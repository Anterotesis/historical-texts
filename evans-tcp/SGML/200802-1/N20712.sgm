<HEAD>Adverti&s;ement. [Annexed to the MOST APPROVED LONDON EDITION of this work, from which this FIRST AMERICAN EDITION has been reprinted.]</HEAD>
<P>THE E&s;&s;ays on Phy&s;iognomy of M. Lavater, are now &s;o univer&s;ally known and celebrated, that it is unnece&s;&s;ary to attempt their eulogium; even tho&s;e who con&s;ider the &s;cience they are written to &s;upport as vi&s;ionary, cannot but admire the lively force of imagination, and animated argument, with which the author has explained and defended his favourite hypothe&s;is. The reception the work has met with from the public, has encouraged cer|tain literary pirates to &s;eize almo&s;t the whole of it, and appropriate it to them&s;elves, by the aid of a pair of &s;ci&s;&s;ars; but in their eagerne&s;s to gra&s;p their reward, they have in &s;ome places &s;o mangled and disfigured it by ab&s;urd errors, in copying or of the pre&s;s, that the author or tran&s;lator (of who&s;e la|bour they have availed them&s;elves, verbatim, with the utmo&s;t effrontery and without any acknow|ledgment) would &s;carcely be able to di&s;cover the meaning, without having recour&s;e to the work they have &s;o di&s;graced, by their mutilated and in|accurate copy. In &s;ome places whole &s;entences ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;en&s;e have been omitted, and in others, words altered to a meaning diame|trically oppo&s;ite. A li&s;t of all the errors, which totally de&s;troy or change the &s;en&s;e of the pa&s;&s;age, without enumerating common typographical mi&s;|takes, would fill more than a page. The publi&s;hers and proprietors, therefore, of the work thus impu|dently &s;tolen, and wretchedly mutilated, now pre&s;ent to the public an abridgment carefully revi&s;ed, cor|rectly printed, and containing, in addition to all that is to be found in the other, nearly a whole &s;heet of letter pre&s;s, and two additional copper-plates, con|taining twelve heads.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Phy&s;iognomy a Science.&mdash;The Truth of Phy&s;iognomy.&mdash;The Advantages of Phy&s;iognomy.&mdash;Its Di&s;advan|tages.&mdash;The Ea&s;e and Difficulty of &s;tudying Phy&s;iog|nomy.&mdash;A Word concerning the Author.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT has been a&s;&s;erted by thou&s;ands, that <Q>though there may be &s;ome truth in phy&s;iognomy, &s;till it never can be a &s;cience.</Q> The&s;e a&s;&s;erti|ons will be repeated, how clearly &s;oever their ob|jections may be an&s;wered, and however little they may have to reply. Phy&s;iognomy is as capable of becoming a &s;cience as any one of the &s;ciences, mathematics excepted. It is a branch of the phy|&s;ical art, and includes theology and the belles lettres. Like the&s;e, it may, to a certain extent, be reduced to rule, and acquire an appropriate character, by which it may be taught.</P>
<P>Whenever truth or knowledge is explaine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">y
<PB N="2" REF="027203_0008_0FD3D2635C408758">
fixed principles, it becomes &s;cientific, &s;o far as it can be imparted by words, lines, rules, and defini|tions. The que&s;tion will &s;tand &s;imply thus: Whe|ther it be po&s;&s;ible to explain the undeniable &s;triking differences which exi&s;t between human faces and forms, not by ob&s;cure and confu&s;ed conceptions, but by certain characters, &s;igns and expre&s;&s;ions? Whether the&s;e &s;igns can communicate the &s;trength and weakne&s;s, health and &s;ickne&s;s of the body; the folly and wi&s;dom, the magnanimity and meanne&s;s, the virtue and vice of the mind? This is the only thing to be decided; and he who, in&s;tead of inve&s;|tigating the que&s;tion, &s;hould continue to declaim again&s;t it, mu&s;t either be deficient in the love of truth, or in logical rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>The experimental philo&s;opher can only proceed with his di&s;coveries to a certain extent; only can communicate them by words; can only &s;ay, <Q>Such and &s;uch are my experiments, &s;uch my remarks, &s;uch is the number of them, and &s;uch are the inferences I draw: pur&s;ue the track that I have explored.</Q> Yet, will he not be unable, &s;ometimes, to &s;ay thus much? Will not his active mind make a thou&s;and remarks, which he will want the power to communicate? Will not his eye penetrate rece&s;&s;es, which he &s;hall be unable to di&s;|cover to that feebler vi&s;ion that cannot di&s;cover for it&s;elf? Is any &s;cience brought to perfection at the moment of its birth? Does not genius continually, with eagle-eye and flight, anticipate centuries? How long did the world wait for Wolf? Who, among the moderns, is more &s;cientific than Bonnet? Who more accurately di&s;tingui&s;hes fal&s;ehood from truth? Yet to whom would he be able to commu|nicate his &s;udden perception of the truth; the re|&s;ult or re&s;ources of tho&s;e numerous, &s;mall, inde|&s;cribable, rapid, profound remarks? To whom could he impart the&s;e by &s;igns, tones, images and rules? Is it not the &s;ame with phy&s;ic, theology, and all the arts and &s;ciences? Is it not the &s;ame with
<PB N="3" REF="027203_0009_0FD3D2BE899E7A88">
painting, at once the mother and daughter of phy&s;iognomy&punc;</P>
<P>How infinitely does he, who is painter or poet born, &s;oar beyond all written rule! But mu&s;t he, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es feelings and power which are not to be reduced to rule, be pronounced un&s;cientific? So, phy&s;iognomonical truth may, to a certain de|gree, be defined, communicated by &s;igns and words, as a &s;cience. This is the look of contempt, this of innocence. Where &s;uch &s;igns are, &s;uch and &s;uch properties re&s;ide.</P>
<P>There can be no doubt of the truth of phy&s;iog|nomy. All countenances, all forms, all created beings, are not only different from each other in their cla&s;&s;es, races, and kinds, but are al&s;o individu|ally di&s;tinct. Each being differs from every other being of its &s;pecies. However generally known, it is a truth the mo&s;t important to our purpo&s;e, and nece&s;&s;ary to repeat, that "there is no ro&s;e perfectly &s;imilar to another ro&s;e, no egg to an egg, no eel to an eel, no lion to a lion, no eagle to an eagle, no man to a man."</P>
<P>Confining this propo&s;ition to man only, it is the fir&s;t, the mo&s;t profound, mo&s;t &s;ecure and un&s;haken foundation-&s;tone of phy&s;iognomy, that however in|timate the analogy and &s;imilarity of the innumera|ble forms of men, no two men can be found, who, brought together, and accurately compared, will not appear to be very remarkably different. Nor is it le&s;s incontrovertible, that it is equally impo&s;&s;i|ble to find two minds, as two countenances, which perfectly re&s;emble each other.</P>
<P>Con&s;iderations like the&s;e will be &s;ufficient to make it received as a truth, not requiring farther demon|&s;tration, that there mu&s;t be a certain native analogy between the external varieties of the countenance and form, and the internal varieties of the mind. Anger renders the mu&s;cles protuberant; and &s;hall not therefore an angry mind and protuberant mu&s;cles be con&s;idered as cau&s;e and effect?</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="027203_0010_0FD3CAEEA6A89758">
After repeated ob&s;ervation, that an active and vivid eye, and an active and acute wit, are frequent|ly found in the &s;ame per&s;on, &s;hall it be &s;uppo&s;ed that there is no relation between the active eye and the active mind? Is this the effect of accident? Ought it not rather to be con&s;idered as &s;ympathy, an interchangeable and in&s;tantaneous effect, when we perceive that, at the very moment the under|&s;tanding is mo&s;t acute and penetrating, and the wit the mo&s;t lively, the motion and fire of the eye un|dergo, at that moment, the mo&s;t vi&s;ible alteration?</P>
<P>But all this is denied by tho&s;e who oppo&s;e the truth of the &s;cience of phy&s;iognomy. Truth, ac|cording to them, is ever at variance with her&s;elf: Eternal order is degraded to a juggler, who&s;e pur|po&s;e it is to deceive.</P>
<P>Calm rea&s;on revolts when it is a&s;&s;erted, that the &s;trong man may appear perfectly like the weak, the man in full health like another in the la&s;t &s;tage of a con&s;umption, or that the ra&s;h and ira&s;cible re|&s;emble the cold and phlegmatic. It revolts to hear it affirmed, that joy and grief, plea&s;ure and pain, love and hatred, all exhibit them&s;elves under the &s;ame traits, that is to &s;ay, under no traits whatever, on the exterior of man. Yet &s;uch are the a&s;&s;er|tions of tho&s;e who maintain that phy&s;iognomy is a chimerical &s;cience. They overturn all that order and combination by which Eternal wi&s;dom &s;o high|ly a&s;toni&s;hes and delights the under&s;tanding. It cannot be too emphatically repeated, that blind chance and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">bitrary di&s;order con&s;titute the philo|&s;ophy of fools, and that they are the bane of natu|ral knowledge, philo&s;ophy, and religion. Entirely to bani&s;h &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem, is the duty of the true in|quirer, the &s;age, and the divine.</P>
<P>It is indi&s;putable that all men, ab&s;olutely all men, e&s;timate all things whatever by their phy&s;iog|nomy, their exterior temporary &s;uperficies. By viewing the&s;e on every occa&s;ion, they draw their conclu&s;ions concerning their internal properties.
<PB N="5" REF="027203_0011_0FD3D22C84D83048">
What merchant, if he be unacquainted with the per&s;on of whom he purcha&s;es, does not e&s;timate his wares by the phy&s;iognomy or appearance of tho&s;e wares? If he purcha&s;ed of a di&s;tant corre&s;|pondent, what other means does he u&s;e in judging whether they are or are not equal to his expecta|tion? Is not his judgment determined by the colour, the finene&s;s, the &s;uperficies, the exterior, the phy&s;iognomy? Does he not judge money by its phy&s;iognomy? Why does he take one guinea, and reject another? Why weigh a third in his hand? Does he not determine according to its colour, or impre&s;&s;ion, its out&s;ide, its phy&s;iognomy? If a &s;tranger enter his &s;hop, as a buyer or &s;eller, will he not ob&s;erve him? Will he not draw conclu|&s;ions from his countenance? Will he not, almo&s;t before he is out of hearing, pronounce &s;ome opini|on of him? and &s;ay, <Q>This man has an hone&s;t look&mdash;this man has a plea&s;ing or forbidding countenance.</Q> What is it to the purpo&s;e whether his judgment be right or wrong? He judges, and, though not wholly, he depends, in part, upon the exterior form, and thence draws inferences concerning the mind.</P>
<P>The farmer, walking through his grounds, re|gulates his future expectations by the colour, the &s;ize, the growth, the exterior; that is to &s;ay, by the phy&s;iognomy of the bloom, the &s;talk or the ear of his corn, the &s;tem and &s;hoots of his vine tree.&mdash;<Q>This ear of corn is blighted&mdash;that wood is full of &s;ap&mdash;this will grow, that not,</Q> affirms he at the fir&s;t or &s;econd glance.&mdash;<Q>Though the&s;e vine-&s;hoots look well, they will bear but few grapes.</Q> And wherefore? He remarks in their appearance, as the phy&s;iognomi&s;t in the countenances of &s;hal|low men, the want of native energy. Does he not judge by the exterior?</P>
<P>Does not the phy&s;ician pay more attention to the phy&s;iognomy of the &s;ick, than to all the accounts
<PB N="6" REF="027203_0012_0FD3D20EB4A5BCC8">
that are brought him concerning his patient? Zimmermann, among the living, may be brought as a proof of the great perfection at which this kind of judgment is arrived; and, among the dead, Kemp, who&s;e &s;on has written a treati&s;e on tempe|rament.</P>
<P>I will &s;ay nothing of the painter, as his art too evidently reproves the childi&s;h and arrogant preju|dices of tho&s;e who pretend to di&s;believe phy&s;iog|nomy. The traveller, the philanthropi&s;t, the mi|&s;anthropi&s;t, the lover, (and who not?) all act ac|cording to their feelings and deci&s;ions, true or fal&s;e, confu&s;ed or clear, concerning phy&s;iognomy. The&s;e feelings, the&s;e deci&s;ions, excite compa&s;&s;ion, di&s;gu&s;t, joy, love, hatred &s;u&s;picion, confidence, re&s;erve, or benevolence.</P>
<P>By what rule do we judge of the &s;ky, but by its phy&s;iognomy? No food, not a gla&s;s of wine or beer, nor a cup of coffee or tea comes to table, which is not judged by its phy&s;iognomy, its exte|rior, and of which we do not then deduce &s;ome conclu&s;ion re&s;pecting its interior good or bad pro|perties. Is not all nature phy&s;iognomy, &s;uperficies and contents, body and &s;pirit, exterior effect and internal power, invi&s;ible beginning and vi&s;ible end|ing?</P>
<P>Phy&s;iognomy, whether under&s;tood in its mo&s;t ex|ten&s;ive or confined &s;ignification, is the origin of all human deci&s;ions, efforts, actions, expectations, fears and hopes; of all plea&s;ing and unplea&s;ing &s;en&s;ati|ons, which are occa&s;ioned by external objects. From the cradle to the grave, in all conditions and ages, throughout all nations, from Adam to the la&s;t exi&s;ting man, from the worm we tread on to the mo&s;t &s;ublime of philo&s;ophers, phy&s;iognomy is the origin of all we do and &s;uffer.</P>
<P>Every in&s;ect is acquainted with its friend and its &s;oe; each child loves and fears, although it knows not why. Phy&s;iognomy is the cau&s;e: nor is there a man to be found on earth who is not daily influ|enced
<PB N="7" REF="027203_0013_0FD3D25F68BC5840">
by phy&s;iognomy; not a man who cannot figure to him&s;elf a countenance, which &s;hall to him appear exceedingly lovely, or exceedingly hateful; not a man who does not, more or le&s;s, the fir&s;t time he is in company with a &s;tranger, ob&s;erve, e&s;timate, compare, and judge of him according to appear|ances, although he might never have heard of the word or thing called phy&s;iognomy; not a man who does not judge of all things that pa&s;s through his hands by their phy&s;iognomy, that is, their inter|nal worth by their external appearance.</P>
<P>The act of di&s;&s;imulation it&s;elf, which is adduced as &s;o in&s;uperable an objection to the truth of phy|&s;iognomy, is founded upon phy&s;iognomy. Why does the hypocrite a&s;&s;ume the appearance of an hone&s;t man, but becau&s;e that he is convinced, though not perhaps from any &s;y&s;tematic reflexion, that all eyes are acquainted with the characteri&s;tic mark of hone&s;ty?</P>
<P>What judge, wi&s;e or unwi&s;e, whether the crimi|nal, confe&s;s or deny the fact, does not &s;ometimes in this &s;en&s;e decide from appearances? Who can, is, or ought to be ab&s;olutely indifferent to the ex|terior of per&s;ons brought before him to be judged? What king would choo&s;e a mini&s;ter without exam|ining his exterior, &s;ecretly at lea&s;t, and to a certain extent? An officer will not enli&s;t a &s;oldier without thus examining his appearance, putting his height out of the que&s;tion. What ma&s;ter or mi&s;tre&s;s of a family will choo&s;e a &s;ervant without con&s;idering the exterior? No matter that their judgment may or may not be ju&s;t, or that it may be exerci&s;ed uncon&s;ciou&s;ly.</P>
<P>I am weary of citing &s;uch numerous in&s;tances, which are &s;o continually before our eyes, to prove that men, tacitly and unanimou&s;ly, confe&s;s the in|fluence which phy&s;iognomy has over their &s;en&s;ati|ons and actions. I feel di&s;gu&s;t at being obliged to write thus, in order to convince the learned of truths which lie within the reach of every child.</P>

Let him &s;ee who has eyes to &s;ee; but &s;hould the light by being brought too clo&s;e to his eyes, produce phren&s;y, he may burn him&s;elf by endea|vouring to extingui&s;h the torch of truth. I am not fond of u&s;ing &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions; but I dare to do my duty, and my duty is boldly to declare, that I believe my&s;elf certain of what I now and hereaf|ter &s;hall affirm; and that I think my&s;elf capable of convincing all lovers of truth, by principles which are in them&s;elves incontrovertible. It is al&s;o ne|ce&s;&s;ary to confute the preten&s;ions of certain litera|ry de&s;pots, and to compel them to be more cautious in their deci&s;ions. It is therefore proved, it being an eternal and manife&s;t truth, that, whether they are or are not &s;en&s;ible of it, all men are daily influ|enced by phy&s;iognomy; nay, there is not a living being, which does not, at lea&s;t after its manner, draw &s;ome inferences from the external to the internal; which does not judge concerning that which is not, by that which is apparent to the &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>This univer&s;al though tacit confe&s;&s;ion, that the exterior, the vi&s;ible, the &s;uperficies of objects, indi|cate their nature, their properties, and that every outward &s;ign is the &s;ymbol of &s;ome inherent quali|ty, I hold to be equally certain and important to the &s;cience of phy&s;iognomy.</P>
<P>When each apple, each apricot, has a phy&s;iog|nomy peculiar to it&s;elf; &s;hall man, the lord of earth, have none? The mo&s;t &s;imple and inanimate object has its characteri&s;tic exterior, by which it is not only di&s;tingui&s;hed as a &s;pecies, but individu|ally; and &s;hall the fir&s;t, noble&s;t, be&s;t harmoni&s;ed, and mo&s;t beautiful being, be denied all character|i&s;tic?</P>

<P>I &s;hall now proceed to inquire into the <HI>Advanta|ges</HI> of phy&s;iognomy. Whether a more certain, more accurate, more exten&s;ive, and thereby a more perfect knowledge of man, be, or be not profitable; whether it be, or be not, advantageous to gain a knowledge of internal qualities from external form and feature? is a que&s;tion mo&s;t de&s;erving of inqui|ry. This may be cla&s;&s;ed fir&s;t as a general que&s;tion, Whether knowledge, its exten&s;ion, and increa&s;e, be of con&s;equence to man?</P>
<P>Certain it is, that if a man has the power, fa|culties and will to obtain wi&s;dom, that he &s;hould exerci&s;e tho&s;e faculties for the attainment of wi&s;|dom. How paradoxical are tho&s;e proofs, that &s;ci|ence and knowledge are detrimental to man, and that a rude &s;tate of ignorance is to be preferred to all that wi&s;dom can teach! I here dare a&s;&s;ert, that phy&s;iognomy has at lea&s;t as many claims of e&s;&s;en|tial advantage, as are granted by men, in general, to other &s;ciences.</P>
<P>With how much ju&s;tice may we not grant pre|cedency to that &s;cience which teaches the know|ledge of men? What object is &s;o important to man, as man him&s;elf? What knowledge can more influ|ence his happine&s;s, than the knowledge of him&s;elf? This advantageous knowledge is the peculiar pro|vince of phy&s;iognomy.</P>
<P>Whoever would wi&s;h perfect conviction of the advantages of phy&s;iognomy, let him imagine but for a moment, that all phy&s;iognomical knowledge and &s;en&s;ation were lo&s;t to the world.

<P>Mutual intercour&s;e is the thing of mo&s;t con&s;e|quence to mankind, who are de&s;tined to live in &s;o|ciety. The knowledge of man is the &s;oul of this intercour&s;e, that which imparts animation to it, plea&s;ure and profit. Let the phy&s;iognomi&s;t ob|&s;erve varieties, make minute di&s;tinctions, e&s;tabli&s;h &s;igns, and invent words, to expre&s;s the&s;e his re|marks; form general ab&s;tract propo&s;itions; extend and improve phy&s;iognomical knowledge, language, and &s;en&s;ation; and thus will the u&s;es and advan|tages of phy&s;iognomy progre&s;&s;ively increa&s;e.</P>
<P>Phy&s;iognomy is a &s;ource of the pure&s;t, the mo&s;t exalted &s;en&s;ations; an additional eye, wherewith to view the manifold proofs of Divine wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s in the creation, and, while thus viewing un&s;peakable harmony and truth, to excite more ec&s;tatic love for their adorable Author. Where the dark, inattentive &s;ight of the unexperienced perceives nothing, there the practical view of the phy&s;iognomi&s;t di&s;covers inexhau&s;tible fountains of delight&mdash;endearing, moral, and &s;piritual. With &s;ecret delight, the philanthropic phy&s;iognomi&s;t di&s;|cerns tho&s;e internal motives which would other|wi&s;e be fir&s;t revealed in the world to come. He di&s;tingui&s;hes what is permanent in the character from what is habitual, and what is habitual from what is accidental. He, thererefore, who reads man in this language, reads him mo&s;t accurately.</P>
<P>To enumerate all the advantages of ph&s;iogno|my, would require a large treati&s;e. The mo&s;t indi&s;|putable, though the mo&s;t important of the&s;e its advantages, are tho&s;e the painter acquires, who, if he be not a phy&s;iognomi&s;t, is nothing. The great|e&s;t

<P>I &s;hall now &s;ay &s;omething with re&s;pect to the <HI>Di&s;advantages</HI> of phy&s;iognomy.</P>
<P>Methinks I hear &s;ome worthy man exclaim: <Q>O thou, who ha&s;t ever hitherto lived the friend of religion and virtue! what is thy pre&s;ent pur|po&s;e? What mi&s;chief &s;hall not be wrought by this thy phy&s;iognomy? Wilt thou teach man the unble&s;&s;ed art of judging his brother by the am|biguous expre&s;&s;ions of his countenance? Are there not already &s;ufficient of cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s, &s;candal, and in&s;pection into the failings of others? Wilt thou teach man to read the &s;e|crets of the heart, the latent feelings, and the various errors of thought?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Thou dwelle&s;t upon the advantages of the &s;cience; &s;aye&s;t thou &s;halt teach men to con|template the beauty of virtue, the hatefulne&s;s of vice, and, by the&s;e means, make them vir|tuous; and that thou in&s;pire&s;t us with an ab|horrence of vice, by obliging us to feel its ex|ternal deformity. And what &s;hall be the con|&s;equence? Shall it not be, that for the appear|ance, and not the reality of goodne&s;s, man &s;hall wi&s;h to be good? that, vain as he al|ready is, acting from the de&s;ire of prai&s;e, and wi&s;hing only to appear what he ought determi|nately to be, he will yet become more vain, and will court the prai&s;e of men, not by words and deeds alone, but by a&s;&s;umed looks and coun|terfeited forms? Oughte&s;t thou not rather to weaken this already too powerful motive for human actions, and to &s;trengthen a better; to turn the eyes inward, to teach actual improve|ment and &s;ilent innocence, in&s;tead of indu|cing him to rea&s;on on the outward fair ex|pre&s;&s;ions of goodne&s;s, or the hateful ones of wickedne&s;s?</Q></P>

of truth. Yet how ea&s;y is defence to me, and how plea&s;ant, when my opponent accu&s;es me from motives of philanthropy, and not of &s;ple|netic di&s;pute! The charge is twofold, Cen&s;oriou&s;|ne&s;s and Vanity. I will an&s;wer the&s;e charges &s;e|parately; and now proceed to reply to the fir&s;t objection.</P>
<P>I teach no black art; no no&s;trum, the &s;ecret of which I might have concealed, which is a thou|&s;and times injurious for once that it is profitable, the di&s;covery of which is therefore &s;o difficult. I do but teach a &s;cience, the mo&s;t general, the mo&s;t palpable, with which all men are acquainted; and &s;tate my feelings, ob&s;ervations, and their con&s;e|quences.</P>
<P>It ought never to be forgotten, that the very purport of outward expre&s;&s;ion is to teach what pa&s;&s;es in the mind, and that to deprive man of this &s;ource of knowledge were to reduce him to utter ignorance; that every man is born with a certain portion of phy&s;iognomical &s;en&s;ation, as certainly as that every man, who is not deformed, is born with two eyes; that all men, in their inter|cour&s;e with each other, form phy&s;iognomical deci&s;ions, according as their judgment is more or le&s;s clear; that it is well known, though phy&s;iog|nomy were never to be reduced to a &s;cience, mo&s;t men, in proportion as they have mingled with the world, derive &s;ome profit from their knowledge of mankind, even at the fir&s;t glance, and that the &s;ame effects were produced long before this que&s;ti|on was in agitation. Whether, therefore, to teach men to decide with more per&s;picuity and certainty, in&s;tead of confu&s;edly; to judge clearly with refined &s;en&s;ations, in&s;tead of rudely and er|roneou&s;ly with &s;en&s;ations more gro&s;s; and, in&s;tead of &s;uffering them to wander in the dark, and ven|ture abortive and injurious judgments, to learn them by phy&s;iognomical experiments, by the rules of prudence and caution, and the &s;ublime voice of

philanthropy, to mi&s;tru&s;t, to be diffident and &s;low to pronounce, where they imagine they di&s;cover evil: whether this, I &s;ay, can be injurious, I leave the world to determine.</P>
<P>I think I may venture to affirm, that very few per&s;ons will, in con&s;equence of this work, begin to judge ill of others, who had not before been guilty of the practice.</P>
<P>The &s;econd objection to phy&s;iognomy is, that <Q>it renders men vain, and teaches them to a&s;&s;ume a plau&s;ible appearance.</Q> The men thou would&s;t reform are not children, who are good, and know that they are &s;o; but men who mu&s;t, from expe|rience, learn to di&s;tingui&s;h between good and evil; men who, to become perfect, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be taught their own various, and con&s;equently their own beneficent qualities. Let therefore, the de&s;ire of obtaining approbation from the good, act in concert with the impul&s;e to goodne&s;s. Let this be the ladder, or, if you plea&s;e, the crutch to &s;up|port tottering virtue. Suffer men to feel that God has ever branded vice with deformity, and adorned virtue with inimitable beauty. Allow man to rejoice when he perceives that his countenance improves in proportion as his heart is ennobled. Inform him only, that to be good from vain mo|tives, is not actual good, but vanity; that the or|naments of vanity will ever be inferior and ignoble; and that the dignified mien of virtue never can be truly attained, but by the actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of virtue, un&s;ullied by the leven of vanity.</P>
<P>Let me now &s;ay a word or two as to the <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e</HI> and <HI>Difficulties</HI> attending the &s;tudy of phy&s;iognomy.

<P>It is not ju&s;t, too ha&s;tily to decide on the po&s;&s;ible ea&s;e or difficulty of any &s;ubject which we have not yet examined.

There is no &s;tudy, however difficult, which may not be attained by per&s;everance and re&s;olution.</P>
<P>We have men con&s;tantly before us. In the very &s;malle&s;t towns there is a continual influx and reflux of per&s;ons, of various and oppo&s;ite charac|ters: among the&s;e many are known to us without con&s;ulting phy&s;iognomy; and that they are pati|ent or choloric, credulous or &s;u&s;picious, wi&s;e or fooli&s;h, of moderate or weak capacity, we are con|vinced pa&s;t contradiction.

inventing difficulties, without number of limits, on the mo&s;t common and ea&s;y &s;ubjects.

I have an additional motive to be brief, which is, that mo&s;t of the&s;e difficulties are included in the inde&s;cribable minutene&s;s of innumerable traits of character, or the impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;eizing, expre&s;&s;ing, and analy&s;ing certain &s;en&s;ations and ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more certain than that the &s;malle&s;t &s;hades, which are &s;carcely di&s;cernible to an unexperienced eye, frequently denote total oppo&s;i|tion of character. How wonderfully may the expre&s;&s;ion of countenance and character be altered by a &s;mall inflexion or dimini&s;hing, lengthening or &s;harpening, even though but of a hair's breadth!</P>
<P>How difficult, how impo&s;&s;ible, mu&s;t this variety of the &s;ame countenance, even in the mo&s;t accurate of the arts of imitation, render preci&s;ion! How often does it happen, that the &s;eat of character is &s;o hidden, &s;o enveloped, &s;o ma&s;ked, that it can only be caught in certain, and perhaps uncommon po&s;itions of the countenance; which will again be changed, and the &s;igns all di&s;appear, before they have made any durable impre&s;&s;ion! or, &s;uppo&s;ing the impre&s;&s;ion made, the&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hing traits may be &s;o difficult to &s;eize, that it &s;hall be impo&s;&s;ible to paint, much le&s;s to engrave, or de&s;cribe them by language.</P>
<P>It is with phy&s;iognomy as with all other objects of ta&s;te, literal or figurative, of &s;en&s;e, or of &s;pirit. How many thou&s;and accidents, great and &s;mall, phy&s;ical and moral; how many &s;ecret incidents, alterations, pa&s;&s;ions; how often will dre&s;s, po&s;iti|on, light and &s;hade; and innumerable di&s;cordant circum&s;tances, &s;how the countenance &s;o di&s;advanta|geou&s;ly, or, to &s;peak more properly, betray the

<P>We will therefore grant the oppo&s;er of phy&s;iog|nomy all he can a&s;k, although we do not live with|out hope, that many of the difficulties &s;hall be re|&s;olved, which, at fir&s;t, appeared to the reader and to the author inexplicable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The following lines, to the end of the Introduction, contain M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Lavater's own remarks on him&s;elf.</NOTE></P>
<P>It is highly incumbent upon me that I &s;hould not lead my readers to expect more from me than I am able to perform. Whoever publi&s;hes a con|&s;iderable work on phy&s;iognomy, gives his readers apparently to under&s;tand, that he is much better acquainted with the &s;ubject than any of his cotem|poraries. Should an error e&s;cape him, he expo&s;es him&s;elf to the &s;evere&s;t ridicule; he is contemned, at lea&s;t by tho&s;e who do not read him, for preten&s;i|ons which probably they &s;uppo&s;e him to make, but which in reality he does not make.</P>
<P>The God of truth, and all who know me, will bear te&s;timony, that from my whole &s;oul I de&s;pi&s;e deceit, as I do all &s;illy claims to &s;uperior wi&s;dom and infallibility, which &s;o many writers, by a thou|&s;and artifices, endeavour to make their readers imagine they po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, therefore, I declare, what I have uniformly declared on all occa&s;ions, although the per&s;ons who &s;peak of me and my works endeavour to conceal it from them&s;elves and others, that I under&s;tand but little of phy&s;iognomy; that I have been, and con|tinue daily to be, mi&s;taken in my judgment: but the&s;e errors are the mo&s;t natural and mo&s;t certain
<PB N="18" REF="027203_0024_0FD3D274E828E628">
means of correcting, confirming, and extending my knowledge.</P>
<P>It will probably not be di&s;agreeable to many of my readers, to be informed, in part, of the progre&s;s of my mind in this &s;tudy.</P>
<P>Before I reached the twenty-fifth year of my age, there was nothing I &s;hould have &s;uppo&s;ed more improbable, than that I &s;hould make the &s;malle&s;t inquiries concerning, much le&s;s that I &s;hould write a book on, phy&s;iognomy. I was neither inclined to read nor make the &s;lighte&s;t ob&s;ervations on the &s;ubject. The extreme &s;en&s;ibility of my nerves occa&s;ioned me, however, to feel certain emotions at beholding certain countenances. I &s;ometimes in&s;tinctively formed a judgment according to the&s;e fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions, and was laughed at, a&s;hamed, and became cautious. Years pa&s;&s;ed away before I again dared, impelled by &s;imilar impre&s;&s;ions, to venture &s;imilar opinions. In the mean time, I occa&s;ionally &s;ketched the countenance of a friend, whom by chance I had lately been ob&s;erving. I had, from my earlie&s;t youth, a propen&s;ity to drawing, and e&s;pecially to drawing of portraits, although I had but little genius or per&s;everance. By this practice my latent feelings began partly to unfold them&s;elves. The various proportions, &s;imilitudes, and varieties of the human countenance became more apparent. It has happened that, on two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive days, I have drawn two faces, the features of which had a remarkable re&s;emblance. This awakened my at|tention; and my a&s;toni&s;hment increa&s;ed when I received certain proofs that the&s;e per&s;ons were as &s;imilar in character as in feature.</P>
<P>I was afterwards induced by M. Zimmermann, phy&s;ician to the court of Hanover to write my thoughts on this &s;ubject. I met with many oppo|nents; and this oppo&s;ition obliged me to make deeper and more laborious re&s;earches, till at length the pre&s;ent work on phy&s;iognomy was produced.</P>
<P>Here I mu&s;t repeat the full conviction I feel,
<PB N="19" REF="027203_0025_0FD3D231F1CDC568">
that my whole life would be in&s;ufficient to form any approach towards a perfect and con&s;i&s;tent whole. It is a field too va&s;t for me &s;ingly to till. I &s;hall find various opportunities of confe&s;&s;ing my deficiency in various branches of &s;cience, without which it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;tudy phy&s;iognomy with that firmne&s;s and certainty which are requi&s;ite. I &s;hall conclude by declaring, with unre&s;erved can|dour, and wholly committing my&s;elf to the reader who is the friend of truth,</P>
<P>That I have heard, from the weake&s;t men, re|marks on the human countenance, more acute than tho&s;e I had made; remarks which made mine appear trifling.</P>
<P>That I believe, were various other people to &s;ketch countenances, and write their ob&s;ervations, tho&s;e I have hitherto made would &s;oon become of little importance.</P>
<P>That I daily meet an hundred faces, concerning which I am unable to pronounce any certain opinion.</P>
<P>That no man has any thing to fear from my in|&s;pection, as it is my endeavour to find good in man, nor are there any men in whom good is not to be found.</P>
<P>That &s;ince I have begun thus, to ob&s;erve man|kind, my philanthropy is not dimini&s;hed, but, I will venture to &s;ay, increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>And that now (January 1783), after ten years daily &s;tudy, I am not more convinced of the certain|ty of my own exi&s;tence, than of the truth of the &s;cience of phy&s;iognomy, or than that this truth may be demon&s;trated: and that I hold him to be a weak and &s;imple per&s;on, who &s;hall affirm, that the effects of the impre&s;&s;ions made upon him by all po&s;&s;ible human countenances are equal.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>On the Nature of Men, which is the Foundation of the Science of Phy&s;iognomy&mdash;Difference between Phy&s;iog|nomy and Pathognomy.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MAN is the mo&s;t perfect of all earthly crea|tures, the mo&s;t imbued with the principles of life. Each particle of matter is an immen&s;ity, each leaf a world, each in&s;ect an inexplicable compendi|um. Who, then, &s;hall enumerate the gradations between in&s;ect and man? In him all the powers of nature are united. He is the e&s;&s;ence of creation. The &s;on of earth, he is the earth's lord: the &s;um|mary and central point of all exi&s;tence, of all powers, and of all life, on that earth which he inhabits.</P>
<P>There are no organi&s;ed beings with which we are acquainted, man alone excepted, in which are &s;o wonderfully united the&s;e different kinds of life, the animal, the intellectual, and the moral. Each of the&s;e lives is the compendium of various fa|culties, mo&s;t wonderfully compounded and har|moni&s;ed.</P>
<P>To know, to de&s;ire, to act, or accurately to ob|&s;erve and meditate, to perceive and to wi&s;h, to po&s;&s;e&s;s the power of motion and re&s;i&s;tance&mdash;the&s;e combined, con&s;titute man an animal, intellectual, and moral being.</P>
<P>Endowed with the&s;e faculties, and with this triple life, man is in him&s;elf the mo&s;t worthy &s;ubject of ob&s;ervation, as he likewi&s;e is him&s;elf the mo&s;t worthy ob&s;erver. In him each &s;pecies of life is con&s;picuous; yet never can his properties be wholly known, except by the aid of his external form, his body, his &s;uperficies. How &s;piritual, how incor|poreal &s;oever his internal e&s;&s;ence may be, &s;till is he only vi&s;ible and conceivable from the harmony of
<PB N="21" REF="027203_0027_0FD3D2765EB02BB0">
his con&s;tituent parts. From the&s;e he is in&s;eparable. He exi&s;ts and moves in the body he inhabits, as in his element. This threefold life which man cannot be denied to po&s;&s;e&s;s, nece&s;&s;arily fir&s;t becomes the &s;ubject of di&s;qui&s;ition and re&s;earch, as it pre&s;ents it&s;elf in the form of body, and in &s;uch of his facul|ties as are apparent to &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>By &s;uch external appearances as affect the &s;en&s;es, all things are characteri&s;ed; they are the founda|tions of all human knowledge. Man mu&s;t wander in the darke&s;t ignorance, equally with re&s;pect to him&s;elf and the objects that &s;urround him, did he not become acquainted with their properties and powers by the aid of their externals; and had not each object a character peculiar to its nature and e&s;&s;ence, which acquaints us with what it is, and enables us to di&s;tingui&s;h it from what it is not.</P>
<P>We &s;urvey all bodies that appear to &s;ight under a certain form and &s;uperficies; we behold tho&s;e outlines traced which are the re&s;ult of their orga|ni&s;ation. I hope I &s;hall be pardoned the repetition of common-place truths, &s;ince on the&s;e is built the &s;cience of phy&s;iognomy, or the proper &s;tudy of man.</P>
<P>The organi&s;ation of man peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;hes him from all other earthly beings; and his phy&s;i|ognomy, that is to &s;ay, his &s;uperficies, and outlines of this organi&s;ation, &s;how him to be infinitely &s;upe|rior to all tho&s;e vi&s;ible beings by which he is &s;ur|rounded. We are unacquainted with any form equally noble, equally maje&s;tic with that of man; and in which &s;o many kinds of life, &s;o many pow|ers, &s;o many virtues of action and motion unite as in a central point. With firm &s;tep he advances over the earth's &s;urface, and with erect body rai&s;es his head to heaven. He looks forward to infini|tude; he acts with facility and &s;wiftne&s;s inconceiv|able, and his motions are the mo&s;t immediate and the mo&s;t varied. By whom may their varieties be enumerated? He can at once both &s;uffer and per|form
<PB N="22" REF="027203_0028_0FD3D277CA4E59F8">
infinitely more than any other creature. He unites flexibility and fortitude, &s;trength and dexte|rity, activity and re&s;t. Of all creatures he can the &s;oone&s;t yield, and the longe&s;t re&s;i&s;t. None re&s;em|ble him in the variety and harmony of his powers. His faculties, like his form, are peculiar to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The make and proportion of man, his &s;uperior height, capable of &s;o many changes, and &s;uch vari|ety of motion, prove to the unprejudiced ob&s;erver his &s;uperior eminent &s;trength, and a&s;toni&s;hing faci|lity of action. The high excellence and phy&s;iolo|gical unity of human nature are vi&s;ible at the fir&s;t glance. The head, e&s;pecially the face, and the formation of the firm parts, compared to the firm parts of other animals, convince the accurate ob|&s;erver, who is capable of inve&s;tigating truth, of the greatne&s;s and &s;uperiority of his intellectual quali|ties. The eye, the look, the cheeks, the mouth, the forehead, whether con&s;idered in a &s;tate of en|tire re&s;t, or during their innumerable varieties of motion,&mdash;in fine, whatever is under&s;tood by phy&s;i|ognomy&mdash;are the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive, the mo&s;t con|vincing picture of interior &s;en&s;ation, de&s;ires, pa&s;&s;i|ons, will, and of all tho&s;e properties which &s;o much exalt moral above animal life.</P>
<P>Although the phy&s;iological, intellectual, and mo|ral life of man, with all their &s;ubordinate powers, and their con&s;tituent parts, &s;o eminently unite in one being; although the&s;e three kinds of life do not, like three di&s;tinct families, re&s;ide in &s;eparate parts or &s;tories of the body, but co-exi&s;t in one point, and by their combination form one whole; yet it is plain, that each of the&s;e powers of life has its peculiar &s;tation, where it more e&s;pecially unfolds it&s;elf and acts.</P>
<P>It is beyond contradiction evident, that, though phy&s;iological or animal life di&s;plays it&s;elf through all the body and e&s;pecially through all the animal parts, yet it acts more con&s;picuou&s;ly in the arm, from the &s;houlder to the ends of the fingers.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="027203_0029_0FD3D208B95BA7A0">
It is not le&s;s evident, that intellectual life, or the power of the under&s;tanding and the mind, make them&s;elves mo&s;t apparent in the circumference and form of the &s;olid parts of the head, e&s;pecially the forehead; though they will di&s;cover them&s;elves, to an attentive and accurate eye, in every part and point of the human body, by the congeniality and harmony of the various parts. Is there any occa|&s;ion to prove, that the power of thinking re&s;ides neither in the foot, in the hand, nor in the back, but in the head, and in its internal parts?</P>
<P>The moral life of man particularly reveals it&s;elf in the lines, marks and tran&s;itions of the counte|nance. His moral powers and de&s;ires; his irrita|bility, &s;ympathy, and antipathy; his facility of at|tracting or repelling the objects that &s;urround him: the&s;e are all &s;ummed up in, and painted upon his countenance when at re&s;t. When any pa&s;&s;ion is called into action, &s;uch pa&s;&s;ion is depicted by the motion of the mu&s;cles, and the&s;e motions are ac|companied by a &s;trong palpitation of the heart. If the countenance be tranquil, it always denotes tran|quillity in the region of the heart and brea&s;t.</P>
<P>This threefold life of man, &s;o intimately inter|woven through his frame, is &s;till capable of being &s;tudied in its different appropriate parts; and, did we live in a le&s;s depraved world, we &s;hould find &s;ufficient data for the &s;cience of phy&s;iognomy.</P>
<P>The animal life, the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t earthly, would di&s;cover it&s;elf from the rim of the belly to the organs of generation, which would become its central or focal point. The middle or moral life would be &s;eated in the brea&s;t, and the heart would be its central point. The intellectual life, which of the three is &s;upreme, would re&s;ide in the head, and have the eye for its centre. If we take the countenance as the repre&s;entative and epitome of the three divi&s;ions, then will the forehead to the eyebrows be the mirror or image of the under&s;tand|ing; the no&s;e and cheeks, the image of the moral
<PB N="24" REF="027203_0030_0FD3D2371A9BE3C0">
and &s;en&s;itive life; and the mouth and chin, the image of the animal life; while the eye will be to the whole as its &s;ummary and centre.</P>
<P>All that has been hitherto advanced is &s;o clear, &s;o well known, &s;o univer&s;al, that we &s;hould blu&s;h to in&s;i&s;t upon &s;uch common-place truths, were they not fir&s;t the foundation on which we mu&s;t build all we have to propo&s;e; and, again, had not the&s;e truths (can it be believed by futurity?) in this our age been &s;o many thou&s;and times mi&s;taken and con|te&s;ted with the mo&s;t inconceivable affectation.</P>
<P>The &s;cience of phy&s;iognomy, whether under&s;tood in the mo&s;t enlarged or mo&s;t confined &s;en&s;e, indu|bitably depends on the&s;e general and incontrover|tible principles; yet, incontrovertible as they are, they have not been without their opponents. Men pretend to doubt of the mo&s;t &s;triking, the mo&s;t convincing, the mo&s;t &s;elf-evident truths; although, were the&s;e de&s;troyed, neither truth nor knowledge would remain. They do not profe&s;s to doubt con|cerning the phy&s;iognomy of other natural objects; yet do they doubt the phy&s;iognomy of human na|ture&mdash;the fir&s;t object, the mo&s;t worthy of contem|plation, and the mo&s;t animated the realms of na|ture contain.</P>
<P>We have already hinted to our readers, that they are to expect only fragments on phy&s;iognomy from us, and not a perfect &s;y&s;tem. However, what has been &s;aid, may &s;erve as a &s;ketch for &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem. We &s;hall conclude this chapter with &s;now|ing the difference between <HI>Phy&s;iognomy</HI> and <HI>Pathog|nomy.</HI></P>
<P>Phy&s;iognomy is the &s;cience or knowledge of the corre&s;pondence between the external and internal man, the vi&s;ible &s;uperficies and the invi&s;ible con|tents. Phy&s;iognomy, oppo&s;ed to pathognomy, is the knowledge of the &s;igns of the power and in|clinations of men&mdash;Pathognomy is the knowledge of the &s;igns of the pa&s;&s;ions. Phy&s;iognomy there|fore teaches the knowledge of character at re&s;t,
<PB N="25" REF="027203_0031_0FD3D23B01AF32B8">
and pathognomy of character in motion. Charac|ter at re&s;t is taught by the form of the &s;olid and the appearance of the moveable parts while at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Character impa&s;&s;ioned is manife&s;ted by the movea|ble parts in motion.</P>
<P>Phy&s;iognomy may be compared to the &s;um-total of the mind; pathognomy, to the intere&s;t which is the product of this &s;um-total. The former &s;hows what man is in general, the latter what he becomes at particular moments; or, the one what he might be, the other what he is. The fir&s;t is the root and &s;tem of the &s;econd, the &s;oil in which it is planted. Whoever believes the latter and not the former, believes in fruit without a tree, in corn without land.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Signs of Bodily Strength and Weakne&s;s&mdash;Of Health and Sickne&s;s.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE call that human body &s;trong, which can ea&s;ily alter other bodies, without being ea&s;ily altered it&s;elf. The more immediate it can act, and the le&s;s immediately it can be acted upon, the greater is its &s;trength; and the weaker, the le&s;s it can act, or with&s;tand the action of others. There is a tranquil &s;trength, the e&s;&s;ence of which is immobility; and there is an active &s;trength, the e&s;&s;ence of which is motion. The one has motion, the other &s;tability, in an extraordinary degree. There is the &s;trength of the rock, and the ela&s;ti|city of the &s;pring.</P>
<P>There is the Herculean &s;trength of bones and
<PB N="26" REF="027203_0032_0FD3D23D6A640918">
&s;inews; thick, firm, compact, and immoveable as a pillar.</P>
<P>There are heroes le&s;s Herculean, le&s;s firm, &s;i|newy, large; le&s;s &s;et, le&s;s rocky; who yet, when rou&s;ed, when oppo&s;ed in their activity, will meet oppre&s;&s;ion with &s;o much &s;trength, will re&s;i&s;t weight with &s;uch ela&s;tic force, as &s;carcely to be equalled by the mo&s;t mu&s;cular &s;trength.</P>
<P>The elephant has native, bony &s;trength. Irri|tated or not, he bears prodigious burdens, and cru&s;hes all on which he treads. An irritated wa&s;p has &s;trength of a totally different kind: but both have compactne&s;s for their foundation, and e&s;pe|cially the firmne&s;s of con&s;truction. All poro&s;ity de&s;troys &s;trength.</P>
<P>The &s;trength, like the under&s;tanding of a man, is di&s;covered by its being more or le&s;s compact. The ela&s;ticity of a body has &s;igns &s;o remarkable, that they will not permit us to confound &s;uch body with one that is not ela&s;tic. How manife&s;t are the vari|eties of &s;trength between the foot of an elephant and a &s;tag, a wa&s;p and a fly!</P>
<P>Tranquil, firm &s;trength is &s;hown in the propor|tions of the form, which ought rather to be &s;hort than long. In the thick neck, the broad &s;houlders, and the countenance, which, in a &s;tate of health, is rather bony than fle&s;hy. In the &s;hort, compact, the knotty forehead; and e&s;pecially when the <HI>&s;inus frontales</HI> are vi&s;ible, but not too far projecting; flat in the middle, or &s;uddenly indented, but not in &s;mooth cavities. In horizontal eyebrows, &s;ituated near the eye. Deep eyes, and &s;tedfa&s;t look. In the broad, firm no&s;e, bony near the forehead, e&s;|pecially in its &s;traight, angular outlines. In &s;hort, thick, curly hair of the head and beard. In &s;hort, broad teeth, &s;tanding clo&s;e to each other. In com|pact lips, of which the under rather projects than retreats. In the &s;trong, prominent, broad chin.
<PB N="27" REF="027203_0033_0FD3D2795823D710">
In the &s;trong, projecting <HI>os occipitis.</HI> In the ba&s;s voice, the firm &s;tep, and in &s;itting &s;till.</P>
<P>Ela&s;tic &s;trength, the living power of irritability, mu&s;t be di&s;covered in the moment of action; and the firm &s;igns mu&s;t afterwards be ab&s;tracted, when the irritated power is once more at re&s;t. <Q>This body, therefore, which at re&s;t was capable of &s;o little, acted and re&s;i&s;ted &s;o weakly, can, thus irritated, and with this degree of ten&s;ion, be|come thus powerful.</Q> We &s;hall find on inquiry, that this &s;trength, awakened by irritation, gene|rally re&s;ides in thin, tall, but not very tall, and bony, rather than mu&s;cular bodies; in bodies of dark or pale complexions; of rapid motion, join|ed with a certain kind of &s;tiffne&s;s; of ha&s;ty and firm walk; of fixed penetrating look; and with open lips, but ea&s;ily and accurately to be clo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Signs of weakne&s;s are, di&s;proportionate length of body; much fle&s;h; little bone; exten&s;ion; a tottering frame; a loo&s;e &s;kin; round, obtu&s;e, and particularly hollow outlines of the forehead and no&s;e; &s;mallne&s;s of no&s;e and chin; little no&s;trils; the retreating chin; long, cylindrical neck; the walk very ha&s;ty or languid, without firmne&s;s of &s;tep; the timid a&s;pect; clo&s;ing eyelids; open mouth; long teeth; the jaw-bone long, but bent towards the ear; whitene&s;s of complexion; teeth inclined to be yellow or green; fair, long, and tender hair; &s;hrill voice.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to con&s;ider Medicinal Semei|otics, or the Signs of <HI>Health</HI> and <HI>Sickne&s;s.</HI>&mdash;Not I, but an experienced phy&s;ician ought to write on the phy&s;iognomonical and pathognomonical &s;emeiotica of health and &s;ickne&s;s, and de&s;cribe the phy&s;iolo|gical character of the body, and its propen&s;ities to this or that di&s;order. I am beyond de&s;cription ignorant with re&s;pect to the nature of di&s;orders and their &s;igns; &s;till may I, in con&s;equence of the

few ob&s;ervations I have made, declare, with &s;ome certainty, by repeatedly examining the firm parts and outlines of the bodies and countenances of the &s;ick, that it is not difficult to predict what are the di&s;ea&s;es to which the man in health is mo&s;t liable.</P>
<P>Of what infinite importance would &s;uch phy|&s;iognomonical &s;emeiotics, or progno&s;tics of po&s;&s;ible or probable di&s;orders, be, founded on the nature and form of the body! How e&s;&s;ential were it, could the phy&s;ician &s;ay to the healthy, <Q>You naturally have, &s;ome time in your life, to expect this or that di&s;order. Take the nece&s;&s;ary precautions again&s;t &s;uch or &s;uch a di&s;ea&s;e. The virus of the &s;mall-pox &s;lumbers in your body, and may thus or thus be put in motion: thus the hectic, thus the intermittent, and thus the putrid fever.</Q> Oh, how worthy, Zimmermann, would a trea|ti&s;e on phy&s;iognomonical <HI>Diaet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tice</HI> (or regimen) be of thee!</P>
<P>Whoever &s;hall read this author's work on <HI>Expe|rience,</HI> will &s;ee &s;ee how characteri&s;tically he de|&s;cribes various di&s;ea&s;es which originate in the pa&s;|&s;ions. Some quotations from this work, which will ju&s;tify my wi&s;h, and contain the mo&s;t valuable &s;emeiotical remarks, cannot be unacceptable to the reader.</P>
<P><Q>The ob&s;erving mind examines the phy&s;iogno|my of the &s;ick, the &s;igns of which extend over the whole body; but the progre&s;s and change of the di&s;ea&s;e is principally to be found in the countenance and its parts. Sometimes the pa|tient carries the marks of his di&s;ea&s;e: in burn|ing, bilious, and hectic fevers; in the chloro&s;is; the common and black jaundice; in worm ca|&s;es.</Q>&mdash;I, who know &s;o little of phy&s;ic, have &s;e|veral times di&s;covered the di&s;ea&s;e of the tape-worm in the countenance.</P>
<Q><P>In the <HI>furor uterinus,</HI> the lea&s;t ob&s;ervant can
<PB N="29" REF="027203_0035_0FD3D29C76248110">
read the di&s;ea&s;e. The more the countenance is changed, in burning fevers, the greater is the danger. A man who&s;e natural a&s;pect is mild and calm, but who &s;tares at me, with a florid complexion, and wildne&s;s in his eyes, progno&s;|ticates an approaching delirium. I have like|wi&s;e &s;een a look inde&s;cribably wild, accompa|nied by palene&s;s, when nature, in an inflam|mation of the lungs, was coming to a cri&s;is, and the patient was becoming exce&s;&s;ively cold and frantic. The countenance relaxed, the lips pale and hanging, in burning fevers, are bad &s;ymptoms, as they denote great debility; and if the change and decay of the counte|nance be &s;udden, the danger is great. When the no&s;e is pointed, the face of a lead colour, and the lips livid, inflammation has produced gangrene.</P>
<P>There is frequently &s;omething dangerous to be ob&s;erved in the countenance, which cannot be known from other &s;ymptoms, and which yet is very &s;ignificant. Much is to be ob&s;erved in the eyes. Boerhaave examined the eyes of the pa|tient with a magnifying gla&s;s, that he might &s;ee if the blood entered the &s;maller ve&s;&s;els. Hippo|crates held, that the avoiding of light, involunta|ry tears, &s;quinting, one eye le&s;s than the other, the white of the eye inflamed, the &s;mall veins inclined to be black, too much &s;welled, or too much &s;unken, were each and all bad &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>The motion of the patient, and his po&s;ition in bed, ought likewi&s;e to be enumerated among the particular &s;ymptoms of di&s;ea&s;e. The hand car|ried to the forehead, waved or groping in the air, &s;cratching on the wall, and pulling up the bed-clothes, are of this kind. The po&s;ition in bed is a very &s;ignificant &s;ign of the internal &s;itua|tion of the patient, and therefore de&s;erves every
<PB N="30" REF="027203_0036_0FD3D23EE9F78F90">
attention. The more unu&s;ual the po&s;ition is, in any inflammatory di&s;ea&s;e, the more certainly may we conclude that the angui&s;h is great, and con|&s;equently the danger. Hippocrates has de&s;cri|bed the po&s;ition of the &s;ick, in &s;uch ca&s;es, with an accuracy that leaves nothing to be defined. The be&s;t po&s;ition in &s;ickne&s;s is the u&s;ual po&s;ition in health.</P></Q>
<P>I &s;hall add &s;ome other remarks from this phy&s;i|cian and phy&s;iognomi&s;t, who&s;e abilities are &s;uperi|or to envy, ignorance and quackery. <Q>Swift was lean while he was the prey of ambition, chagrin, and ill-temper; but, after the lo&s;s of his under|&s;tanding, he became fat.</Q> His de&s;cription of Envy, and its effects on the body, is incomparable. <Q>The effects of Envy are vi&s;ible, even in children. They become thin, and ea&s;ily fall into con&s;ump|tions. Envy takes away the appetite and &s;leep, and cau&s;es feveri&s;h motion; it produces gloom, &s;hortne&s;s of breath, impatience, re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, and a narrow che&s;t. The good name of others, on which it &s;eeks to avenge it&s;elf by &s;lander, and feigned but not real contempt, hangs like the &s;word &s;u&s;pended by a hair over the head of En|vy, that continually wi&s;hes to torture others, and is it&s;elf continually on the rack. The laughing &s;impleton becomes di&s;turbed as &s;oon as Envy, that wor&s;t of fiends, takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him, and he perceives that he vainly labours to deba&s;e that merit which he cannot rival. His eyes roll, he knits his forehead, he becomes moro&s;e, peevi&s;h, and hangs his lips. There is, it is true, a kind of envy that arrives at old age. Envy in her dark cave, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by tooth|le&s;s furies, there hoards her poi&s;on, which, with infernal wickedne&s;s, &s;he endeavours, to eject over each worthy per&s;on and honourable act.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Congeniality of the Human Form.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE &s;ame vital powers that make the heart beat, give motion to the finger; that which roofs the &s;kull, arches the finger-nail. Art is at varience with her&s;elf: not &s;o Nature. Her crea|tion is progre&s;&s;ive. From the head to the back, from the &s;houlder to the arm, from the arm to the hand, and from the hand to the finger; from the root to the &s;tem, the &s;tem to the branch, the branch to the twig, the twig to the blo&s;&s;om and fruit, each depends on the other, and all on the root: each is &s;imilar in nature and form. There is a determi|nate effect of a determinate power. Through all nature each determinate power is productive only of &s;uch and &s;uch determinate effects. The finger of one body is not adapted to the hand of another body. Each part of an organized body is an image of the whole. The blood in the extremity of the finger, has the character of the blood in the heart. The &s;ame congeniality is found in the nerves, in the bones. One &s;pirit lives in all. Each member of the body is in proportion to that whole of which it is a part. As from the length of the &s;malle&s;t member, the &s;malle&s;t joint of the finger, the pro|portion of the whole, the length and breadth of the body may be found; &s;o al&s;o may the form of the whole from the form of each &s;ingle part. When the head is long, all is long, or round when the head is round, or &s;quare when it is &s;quare.
<PB N="32" REF="027203_0038_0FD3D24036DF6CA0">
One form, one mind, one root appertain to all: therefore is each organized body &s;o much a whole, that, without di&s;cord, de&s;truction, or deformity, nothing can be added or dimini&s;hed.</P>
<P>Every thing in man is progre&s;&s;ive; every thing congenial; form, &s;tature, complexion, hair, &s;kin, veins, nerves, bones, voice, walk, manner, &s;tyle, pa&s;&s;ion, love, hatred. One and the &s;ame &s;pirit is manife&s;t in all. He has a determinate &s;phere, in which his powers and &s;en&s;ations are allowed, with|in which they may be freely exerci&s;ed, but beyond which he cannot pa&s;s. Each countenance is, in|deed, &s;ubject to momentary change, though not perceptible, even in its &s;olid parts; but the&s;e chan|ges are all proportionate: each is mea&s;ured, each proper and peculiar to the countenance in which it takes place. The capability of change is limited. Even that which is affected, a&s;&s;umed, imitated, he|terogeneous, &s;till has the properties of the indivi|dual, originating in the nature of the whole, and is &s;o definite, that it is only po&s;&s;ible in this, but in no other being.</P>
<P>I almo&s;t blu&s;h to repeat this in the pre&s;ent age. What, Po&s;terity! wilt thou &s;uppo&s;e, thus to &s;ee me &s;o often obliged to demon&s;trate to pretended &s;ages, that nature makes no emendation? She labours from one to all. Her's is not disjointed organiza|tion, not mo&s;aic work. The more there is of the mo&s;aic in the works of arti&s;ts, orators, or poets, the le&s;s are they natural; the le&s;s do they re&s;em|ble the copious &s;treams of the fountain; the &s;tem extending it&s;elf to the remote&s;t branch.</P>
<P>The more there is of progre&s;&s;ion, the more there is of truth, power, and nature; the more exten&s;ive, general, durable, and noble is the effect. The de&s;igns of nature are the de&s;igns of a moment; one form, one &s;pirit, appear through the whole. Thus nature forms her lea&s;t plant, and thus her mo&s;t exalted man. I &s;hall have effected nothing by
<PB N="33" REF="027203_0039_0FD3D2AB805553C0">
my phy&s;iognomical labours, if I am not able to de&s;troy that opinion, &s;o ta&s;tele&s;s, &s;o unworthy of the age, &s;o oppo&s;ite to all &s;ound philo&s;ophy, that nature patches up the features of various counte|nances, in order to make one perfect countenance; and I &s;hall think them well rewarded, if the con|geniality, uniformity, and agreement of human organization be &s;o demon&s;trated, that he who &s;hall deny it, will be declared to deny the light of the &s;un at noon-day.</P>
<P>The human body is a plant, each part of which has the character of the &s;tem. Suffer me to repeat this continually, &s;ince this mo&s;t evident of all things is continually controverted, among all ranks of men, in words, deeds, books, and works of art. I therefore find the greate&s;t incongruities in the heads of the greate&s;t ma&s;ters. I know no painter, of whom I can &s;ay he has thoroughly &s;tudied the harmony of the human outline, not even Pou&s;&s;in, no not even Raphael him&s;elf. Let any one cla&s;s the forms of their countenances, and compare them with the forms of nature. Let him, for in|&s;tance, draw the outlines of their foreheads, and endeavour to find &s;imilar outlines in nature, and he will find incongruities, which could not have been expected in &s;uch great ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>Chodowiecki, excepting the too great length and extent, particularly of his human figures, perhaps had the mo&s;t exact feeling of congeniality in cari|cature, that is to &s;ay, of the relative propriety of the deformed, the humorous, or other character|i&s;tical members and features. For as there is con|formity and congeniality in the beautiful, &s;o is there al&s;o in the deformed. Every cripple has the di&s;tortion peculiar to him&s;elf, the effects of which are extended to his whole body. In like manner, the evil actions of the evil, and the good actions of the good, have a conformity of character; at
<PB N="34" REF="027203_0040_0FD3D2057A231A38">
lea&s;t, they are all tinged with this conformity of character.</P>
<P>Little as this &s;eems to be remarked by poets and painters, &s;till is it the foundation of their art; for wherever emendation is vi&s;ible, there admira|tion is at an end. Why has no painter yet been plea&s;ed to place the blue eye be&s;ide the brown one? Yet, ab&s;urd as this would be, no le&s;s ab&s;urd are the incongruities continually encountered by the phy|&s;iognomical eye&mdash;The no&s;e of Venus on the head of Madona.&mdash;I have been a&s;&s;ured by a man of fa&s;hion, that, at a ma&s;querade, with only the aid of an artificial no&s;e, he entirely concealed him&s;elf from the knowledge of all his acquaintance. So much does nature reject what does not appertain to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>I have never yet met with one Roman no&s;e among an hundred circular foreheads in profile. In an hundred other &s;quare foreheads, I have &s;carcely found one in which there were not cavities and prominences. I never yet &s;aw a perpendicular forehead with &s;trongly arched features in the lower part of the countenance, the double chin excepted.</P>
<P>I meet no &s;trong-bowed eye-brows combined with bony perpendicular countenances.</P>
<P>Wherever the forehead is projecting, &s;o in gene|ral are the under lips, children excepted.</P>
<P>I have never &s;een gently arched, yet much re|treating foreheads, combined with a &s;hort &s;nub no&s;e, which, in profile, is &s;harp and &s;unken.</P>
<P>A vi&s;ible nearne&s;s of the no&s;e to the eye, is always attended by a vi&s;ible widene&s;s between the no&s;e and mouth.</P>
<P>A long covering of the teeth, or, in other words a long &s;pace between the no&s;e and mouth, always indicates &s;mall upper lips. Length of form and face is generally attended by well drawn fle&s;hy lips.</P>
<P>I &s;hall at pre&s;ent produce but one more example, which will convince all who po&s;&s;e&s;s acute phy&s;io|gnomical
<PB N="35" REF="027203_0041_0FD3D210CA523A28">
&s;en&s;ation, how great is the harmony of all nature's forms, and how much &s;he hates the incongruous.</P>
<P>Take two, three, or four &s;hades of men re|markable for under&s;tanding; join the features &s;o artificially that no defect &s;hall appear, as far as re|lates to the act of joining; that is, take the fore|head of one, add the no&s;e of a &s;econd, the mouth of a third, the chin of a fourth, and the re&s;ult of this combination of the &s;igns of wi&s;dom &s;hall be folly. Folly is perhaps nothing more than the emendation of &s;ome heterogeneous addition. <Q>But let the&s;e four wi&s;e countenances be &s;uppo&s;ed congruous.</Q> Let them &s;o be &s;uppo&s;ed, or as nearly &s;o as po&s;&s;ible, &s;till their combination will produce the &s;igns of folly.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e therefore who maintain that conclu&s;ion cannot be drawn from a part, from a &s;ingle &s;ection of the profile, to the whole, would be perfectly right, if unarbitrary Nature patched up counte|nances like arbitrary Art; but &s;o &s;he does not. Indeed, when a man, being born with under&s;tand|ing, becomes a fool, there expre&s;&s;ion of heteroge|neou&s;ne&s;s is the con&s;equence. Either the lower part of the countenance extends it&s;elf, or the eyes acquire a direction not conformable to the fore|head, the mouth cannot remain clo&s;ed, or the fea|tures of the countenance, in &s;ome other manner, lo&s;e their con&s;i&s;tency: all becomes di&s;cord; and folly, in &s;uch a countenance, is very manife&s;t. Let him who would &s;tudy phy&s;iognomy, &s;tudy the relation of the con&s;tituent parts of the counte|nance: not having &s;tudied the&s;e, he has &s;tudied nothing.</P>
<P>He only is an accurate phy&s;iognomi&s;t, and has the true &s;pirit of phy&s;iognomy, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;en&s;e, feeling, and &s;ympathetic proportion of the conge|niality and harmony of nature; and who hath a &s;imilar &s;en&s;e and feeling for all emendations and
<PB N="36" REF="027203_0042_0FD3D243451210B0">
additions of art and con&s;traint. He is no phy&s;io|gnomi&s;t who doubts of the propriety, &s;implicity, and harmony of nature, or who has not this phy&s;io|gnomical e&s;&s;ential; who &s;uppo&s;es nature &s;elects members to form a whole, as a compo&s;itor in a printing-hou&s;e does letters to make up a word; who can &s;uppo&s;e the works of nature are the patch-work of a harlequin jacket. Not the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant of in&s;ects is &s;o compounded, much le&s;s man, the mo&s;t perfect of organized beings. He re&s;pires not the breath of wi&s;dom, who doubts of this progre&s;&s;ion, continuity, and &s;implicity of the &s;tructure of nature. He wants a general feel|ing for the works of nature; con&s;equently of art, the imitator of nature. I &s;hall be pardoned this warmth. It is nece&s;&s;ary. The con&s;equences are infinite, and extend to all things. He has the ma&s;ter-key of truth, who has this &s;en&s;ation of the congeniality of nature, and, by nece&s;&s;ary induction, of the human form.</P>
<P>All imperfection in works of art, productions of the mind, moral actions, errors in judgment; all &s;ceptici&s;m, infidelity, and ridicule of religion, na|turally originate in the want of this knowledge and &s;en&s;ation. He &s;oars above all doubt of the Divi|nity and Chri&s;t, who hath them, and who is con|&s;cious of this congeniality. He al&s;o who, at fir&s;t &s;ight, thoroughly under&s;tands and feels the conge|niality of the human form, and that from the want of this congeniality ari&s;es the difference ob|&s;erved between the works of nature and of art, is &s;uperior to all doubt concerning the truth and di|vinity of the human countenance.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have this &s;en&s;e, this feeling, call it which you plea&s;e, will attribute that only, and no|thing more, to each countenance, which it is ca|pable of receiving. They will con&s;ider each ac|cording to its kind, and will as little &s;eek to add a heterogeneous character, as a heterogeneous no&s;e
<PB N="37" REF="027203_0043_0FD3D24509A73100">
to the face. Such will only unfold what nature is de&s;irous of unfolding, give what nature is capable of receiving, and take away that with which na|ture would not be incumbered. They will perceive in the child, pupil, friend, or wife when any di&s;|cordant trait of character makes its appearance; and will endeavour to re&s;tore the original conge|niality, the equilibrium of character and impul&s;e, by acting upon the &s;till remaining harmony, by co|operating with the yet unimpaired e&s;&s;ential powers. They will con&s;ider each &s;in, each vice, as de&s;truc|tive of this harmony; will feel how much each departure from truth, in the human form, at lea&s;t to eyes more penetrating than human eyes are, mu&s;t be manife&s;t, mu&s;t di&s;tort, and mu&s;t become di&s;plea&s;ing to the Creator, by rendering it unlike his image. Who, therefore, can judge better of the works and actions of man, who le&s;s offend or be offended, who more clearly develop cau&s;e and effect, than the phy&s;iognomi&s;t, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a full portion of this knowledge and &s;en&s;ation?</P>

not known it is thus indi&s;pen&s;able. Of all earth's creatures, man alone rejoice in his indi&s;pen&s;ability. No man can render any other man di&s;pen&s;able. The place of no man can be &s;upplied by another.</P>
<P>This belief of the indi&s;pen&s;ability and individu|ality of all men, and in our own metaphy&s;ical in|di&s;pen&s;ability and individuality, is one of the unac|knowledged, the noble fruits of phy&s;iognomy; a fruit pregnant with mo&s;t precious &s;eed, whence &s;hall &s;pring lenity and love.

The wickede&s;t, the mo&s;t deformed of men, is &s;till more noble than the mo&s;t beauteous and perfect animal. Contemplate, O man! what thy nature is, not what it might be, not what is wanting.

How wilt thou value the in|dividuality, the indi&s;pen&s;ability of his being! How wilt thou wonder at the harmony of his parts, each contributing to form one whole; at their relation, the relation of his million-fold individuality, to &s;uch multitudes of other individuals! Yes, we wonder at and adore the &s;o &s;imple, yet &s;o infinitely varied expre&s;&s;ion of Almighty power inconceivable, &s;o e&s;pecially and &s;o gloriou&s;ly revealed in the nature of man.</P>
<P>No man cea&s;es to be a man, how low &s;oever he may &s;ink beneath the dignity of human nature. Not being bea&s;t, he &s;till is capable of amendment, of approaching perfection. The wor&s;t of faces &s;till is a human face. Humanity ever continues the honour and ornament of man.</P>
<P>It is as impo&s;&s;ible for a brute animal to become man, although he may in many actions approach, or almo&s;t &s;urpa&s;s him, as for man to become a brute, although many men indulge them&s;elves in actions which we cannot view in brutes without abhorrence.</P>
<P>But the very capacity of voluntarily deba&s;ing him&s;elf, in appearance even below brutality, is the honour and privilege of man. This very capacity of imitating all things by an act of his will, and the powers of his under&s;tanding, this very capacity man only has, bea&s;ts have not. The countenances of bea&s;ts are not &s;u&s;ceptible of any remarkable dete|rioration, nor are they capable of any remarkable amelioration or beautifying. The wor&s;t of the countenances of men may be &s;till more deba&s;ed; but they may al&s;o, to a certain degree be improved and ennobled.</P>
<P>The degree of perfection, or degradation, of which man is capable, cannot be de&s;cribed. For

this rea&s;on, the wor&s;t countenance has a well-founded claim to the notice, e&s;teem, and hope of all good men. Again, in every human counte|nance, however deba&s;ed, humanity is &s;till vi&s;ible, that is, the image of the Deity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Forehead.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I SHALL appropriate this and &s;ome of the fol|lowing chapters to remarks on certain individu|al parts of the human body. The following are my own remarks on foreheads.</P>
<P>The form, height, arching, proportion, obli|quity, and po&s;ition of the &s;kull, or bone of the forehead, &s;how the propen&s;ity, degree of power, thought and &s;en&s;ibility of man. The covering or &s;kin of the forehead, its po&s;ition, colour, wrinkles, and ten&s;ion, denote the pa&s;&s;ions and pre&s;ent &s;tate of the mind. The bones give the internal quanti|ty, and their covering the application of power.</P>
<P>Though the &s;kin be wrinkled, the forehead bones remain unaltered; but this wrinkling varies according to the various forms of the bones. A certain degree of flatne&s;s produces certain wrin|kles;
<PB N="45" REF="027203_0052_0FD3D27C3427DE20">
a certain arching is attended by certain other wrinkles; &s;o that the wrinkles, &s;eparately con&s;i|dered, will give the arching; and this, vice ver&s;a, will give the wrinkles. Certain foreheads can only have perpendicular, others horizontal, others curved, and others mixed and confu&s;ed wrinkles. Cup-formed (&s;mooth) cornerle&s;s foreheads, when they are in motion, commonly have the &s;imple&s;t and lea&s;t perplexed wrinkles.</P>
<P>I con&s;ider the peculiar delineation of the out|line and po&s;ition of the forehead, which has been left unattempted by ancient and modern phy&s;iog|nomi&s;ts, to be the mo&s;t important of all the things pre&s;ented to phy&s;iognomical ob&s;ervation. We may divide foreheads, con&s;idered in profile, into three principal cla&s;&s;es, the retreating, the perpen|dicular, and the projecting. Each of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es has a multitude of variations, which may ea&s;ily again be cla&s;&s;ed, and the chief of which are recti|linear; half round, half rectilinear, flowing into each other; half round, half rectilinear, inter|rupted; curve lined, &s;imple; the curve lined, double and triple.</P>
<P>I &s;hall add &s;ome more particular remarks, which I apprehend will not be unacceptable to my read|ers:</P>
<P N="1">1. The longer the forehead, the more compre|hen&s;ion, and le&s;s activity.</P>
<P N="2">2. The more compre&s;&s;ed, &s;hort, and firm the forehead, the more compre&s;&s;ion, firmne&s;s, and le&s;s volatility in the man.</P>
<P N="3">3. The more curved and cornerle&s;s the outline, the more tender and flexible the character; the more rectilinear, the more pertinacity and &s;eve|rity.</P>
<P N="4">4. Perfect perpendicularity, from the hair to the eye-brows, want of under&s;tanding.</P>
<P N="5">5. Perfect perpendicularity, gently arched at the
<PB N="46" REF="027203_0053_0FD3D24D19226AF0">
top, denotes excellent propen&s;ities of cold, tran|quil, profound thinking.</P>
<P N="6">6. Projecting&mdash;imbecility, immaturity, weak|ne&s;s, &s;tupididity.</P>
<P N="7">7. Retreating, in general, denotes &s;uperiority of imagination, wit, and acutene&s;s.</P>
<P N="8">8. The round and prominent forehead above, &s;traight lined below, and on the whole perpendicu|lar, &s;hows much under&s;tanding, life, &s;en&s;ibility, ardour, and icy coldne&s;s.</P>
<P N="9">9. The oblique, rectilinear forehead, is al&s;o very ardent and vigorous.</P>
<P N="10">10. Arched foreheads appear properly to be feminine.</P>
<P N="11">11. A happy union of &s;traight and curved lines, with a happy po&s;ition of the forehead, expre&s;s the mo&s;t perfect character of wi&s;dom. By happy uni|on, I mean, when the lines in&s;en&s;ibly flow into each other; and by happy po&s;ition, when the forehead is neither too perpendicular, nor too re|treating.</P>
<P N="12">12. I might almo&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h it as an axiom, that right lines, con&s;idered as &s;uch, and curves, con&s;i|dered as &s;uch, are related as power and weakne&s;s, ob&s;tinacy and flexibility, under&s;tanding and &s;en|&s;ation.</P>
<P N="13">13. I have hitherto &s;een no man with &s;harp pro|jecting eye-bones, who had not great propen&s;ity to an acute exerci&s;e of the under&s;tanding, and to wi&s;e plans.</P>
<P N="14">14. Yet there are many excellent heads which have not this &s;harpne&s;s, and which have the more &s;olidity, if the forehead, like a perpendicular wall, &s;ink upon the horizontal eyebrows, and be greatly rounded on each &s;ide towards the temples.</P>
<P N="15">15. Perpendicular foreheads, projecting &s;o as not immediately to re&s;t upon the no&s;e, which are &s;mall, wrinkly, &s;hort and &s;hining, are certain &s;igns of
<PB N="47" REF="027203_0054_0FD3D2B331DE2CA0">
weakne&s;s, little under&s;tanding, little imagination, little &s;en&s;ation.</P>
<P N="16">16. Foreheads with many angular, knotty pro|tuberances, ever denote much vigorous, firm, har&s;h, oppre&s;&s;ive, ardent activity, and per&s;eve|rance.</P>
<P N="17">17. It is a &s;ure &s;ign of a clear, &s;ound under|&s;tanding, and a good temperament, when the pro|file of the forehead has two proportionate arches, the lower of which projects.</P>
<P N="18">18. Eyebones with defined, marking, ea&s;ily de|lineated, firm arches, I never &s;aw but in noble and in great men. All the ideal antiques have the&s;e arches.</P>
<P N="19">19. Square foreheads, that is to &s;ay, with ex|ten&s;ive temples and firm eyebones, &s;how circum|&s;pection and certainty of character.</P>
<P N="20">20. Perpendicular wrinkles, if natural to the forehead, denote application and power; horizon|tal wrinkles, and tho&s;e broken in the middle, or at the extremities, in general negligence, or want of power.</P>
<P N="21">21. Perpendicular, deep indentings, in the bones of the forehead, between the eyebrows, I never met with but in men of &s;ound under&s;tanding, and free and noble minds, unle&s;s there were &s;ome po&s;i|tively contradictory feature.</P>
<P N="22">22. A blue vena frontalis, in the form of a Y, when in an open, &s;mooth, well-arched forehead, I have only found in men of extraordinary talents, and of an ardent and generous character.</P>
<P N="23">23. The following are the mo&s;t indubitable &s;igns of an excellent, a perfectly beautiful and &s;ignifi|cant, intelligent, and noble forehead.</P>
<P>An exact proportion to the other parts of the countenance. It mu&s;t equal the no&s;e or the under part of the face in length, that is, one-third.</P>
<P>In breadth, it mu&s;t be either oval at the top
<PB N="48" REF="027203_0055_0FD3D27DB78764A0">
(like the foreheads of mo&s;t of the great men of En|gland) or nearly &s;quare.</P>
<P>A freedom from unevenne&s;s and wrinkles, yet with the power of wrinkling when deep in thought, afflicted by pain, or from ju&s;t indignation.</P>
<P>Above it mu&s;t retreat, project beneath.</P>
<P>The eyebones mu&s;t be &s;imple, horizontal, and, if &s;een from above, mu&s;t pre&s;ent a pure curve.</P>
<P>There &s;hould be a &s;mall cavity in the centre, from above to below, and traver&s;ing the forehead &s;o as to &s;eparate into four divi&s;ions, which can only be perceptible by a clear de&s;cending light.</P>
<P>The &s;kin mu&s;t be more clear in the forehead than in the other parts of the countenance.</P>
<P>The forehead mu&s;t every where be compo&s;ed of &s;uch outlines as, if the &s;ection of one third only be viewed, it can &s;carcely be determined whether the lines are &s;traight or circular.</P>
<P N="24">24. Short, wrinkled, knotty, regular, pre&s;&s;ed in one &s;ide, and &s;awcut foreheads, with intere&s;ting wrinkles, are incapable of durable friend&s;hip.</P>
<P N="25">25. Be not di&s;couraged &s;o long as a friend, an enemy, a child, or a brother, though a tran&s;gre&s;&s;|or, has a good, well proportioned, open forehead&punc; there is &s;till much certainty of improvement, much cau&s;e of hope.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Eyes and Eyebrows.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>BLUE Eyes are generally more &s;ignificant of weakne&s;s, effeminacy, and yielding, than brown and black. True it is, there are many pow|erful men with blue eyes; but I find more &s;trength,
<PB N="49" REF="027203_0056_0FD3D2B535840AF0">
manhood, and thought, combined with brown than with blue. Wherefore does it happen, that the Chine&s;e, or the people of the Philippine I&s;lands, are very &s;eldom blue-eyed; and that Europeans only, or the de&s;cendants of Europeans, have blue eyes in tho&s;e countries? This is the more worthy inquiry, becau&s;e there are no people more effemi|nate, luxurious, peaceable or indolent than the Chine&s;e.</P>
<P>Choleric men have eyes of every colour, but more brown, and inclined to green, than blue. This propen&s;ity to green is almo&s;t a deci&s;ive token of ardour, fire, and courage.</P>
<P>I have never met with clear blue eyes in the me|lancholic, &s;eldom in the choloric; but mo&s;t in the phlegmatic temperament, which, however, had much activity.</P>
<P>When the under arch de&s;cribed by the upper eyelid is perfectly circular, it always denotes good|ne&s;s and tenderne&s;s, but al&s;o fear, timidity, and weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>The open eye, not compre&s;&s;ed, forming a long acute angle with the no&s;e, I have but &s;eldom &s;een, except in acute and under&s;tanding per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Hitherto I have &s;een no eye, where the eyelid formed a horizontal line over the pupil, that did not appertain to a very acute, able, &s;ubtle man; but be it under&s;tood, that I have met with this eye in very worthy men, but men of great penetration and &s;imulation.</P>
<P>Wide, open eyes, with the white &s;een under the apple, I have often ob&s;erved in the timid and phlegmatic, and al&s;o in the courageous and ra&s;h. When compared, however, the fiery and the fee|ble, the determined and the undetermined, will ea&s;ily be di&s;tingui&s;hed. The former are more firm, more &s;trongly delineated, have le&s;s obliquity, have thicker, better cut, but le&s;s &s;kinny eyelids.</P>

<HEAD>ADDITION, From the Gotha Court Calendar, 1771, or rather from Buffon.</HEAD>
<P>"The colours mo&s;t common to the eyes are, the orange, yellow, green, blue, grey, and grey mixed with white. The blue and orange are mo&s;t predominant, and are often found in the &s;ame eye. Eyes &s;uppo&s;ed to be black are only yellow, brown, or a deep orange; to convince our&s;elves of which, we need but look at them clo&s;ely; for when &s;een at a di&s;tance, or turned towards the light, they appear to be black; becau&s;e the yellow-brown co|lour is &s;o contra&s;ted to the white of the eye, that the oppo&s;ition makes it &s;uppo&s;ed black. Eyes al&s;o of a le&s;s dark colour pa&s;s for black eyes, but are not e&s;teemed &s;o fine as the other, becau&s;e the contra&s;t is not &s;o great. There are al&s;o yellow and light yellow eyes, which do not appear black, becau&s;e the colours are not deep enough to be overpowered by the &s;hade.</P>
<P>"It is not uncommon to perceive &s;hades of orange, yellow, grey, and blue, in the &s;ame eye; and whenever blue appears, however &s;mall the tincture, it becomes the predominant colour, and appears in &s;treaks over the whole iris. The orange is in flakes, round, and at &s;ome little di&s;tance from the pupil; but it is &s;o &s;trongly effaced by the blue, that the eye appears wholly blue, and the mixture of orange is only perceived when clo&s;ely in&s;pected.</P>
<P>"The fine&s;t eyes are tho&s;e which we imagine to be black or blue. Vivacity and fire, which are the principal characteri&s;tics of the eyes, are the more emitted when the colours are deep and contra&s;ted, rather than when &s;lightly &s;haded. Black eyes have mo&s;t &s;trengh of expre&s;&s;ion, and mo&s;t vivacity;
<PB N="51" REF="027203_0058_0FD3D2B8C2F32080">
but the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> mo&s;t mildne&s;s, and perhaps are more arch. In the former there is an ardour uninterruptedly bright, becau&s;e the colour, which appears to us uniform, every way emits &s;imilar re|flexions. But modifications are di&s;tingui&s;hed in the light which animates blue eyes, becau&s;e there are various tints of colour, which produce various reflexions.</P>
<P>"There are eyes which are remarkable for hav|ing what may be &s;aid to be no colour. They ap|pear to be differently con&s;tituted from others. The iris has only &s;ome &s;hades of blue, or grey, &s;o feeble, that they are, in &s;ome parts, almo&s;t white; and the &s;hades of orange which intervene are &s;o &s;mall that they &s;carcely can be di&s;tingui&s;hed from grey or white, notwith&s;tanding the contra&s;t of the&s;e colours. The black of the pupil is then too mark|ing, becau&s;e the colour of the iris is not deep enough, and, as I may &s;ay, we &s;ee only the pupil in the centre of the eye. The&s;e eyes are unmean|ing, and appear to be fixed and agha&s;t.</P>
<P>"There are al&s;o eyes, the colour of the iris of which is almo&s;t green; but the&s;e are more uncom|mon than the blue, the grey, the yellow, and the yellow-brown. There are al&s;o people who&s;e eyes are not both of the &s;ame colour.</P>
<P>"The images of our &s;ecret agitations are parti|cularly painted in the eyes. The eye appertains more to the &s;oul than any other organ; &s;eems af|fected by, and to participate in, all its motions; expre&s;&s;es &s;en&s;ations the mo&s;t lively, pa&s;&s;ions the mo&s;t tumultuous, feelings the mo&s;t delightful, and &s;entiments the mo&s;t delicate. It explains them in all their force, in all their purity, as they take birth; and tran&s;mits them by traits &s;o rapid, as to infu&s;e into other minds the fire, the activity, the very image with which them&s;elves are in&s;pired.
<PB N="52" REF="027203_0059_0FD3D2BA748962F8">
The eye at once receives and reflects the intelli|gence of thought, and the warmth of &s;en&s;ibility. It is the &s;en&s;e of the mind, the tongue of the un|der&s;tanding."</P>

<P>Again, "As in nature, &s;o in art, the eyes are differently formed in the &s;tatues of the gods, and in heads of ideal beauty, &s;o that the eye it&s;elf is the di&s;tingui&s;hing token. Jupiter, Juno, and Apollo, have large, round, well arched eyes, &s;hort|ened in length, in order that the arch may be the higher. Pallas, in like manner, has large eyes; but the upper eyelid, which is drawn up, is ex|pre&s;&s;ive of attraction and langui&s;hment. Such an eye di&s;tingui&s;hes the heavenly Venus Urania from Juno; yet the &s;tatue of this Venus bearing a dia|dem, has for that rea&s;on often been mi&s;taken, by tho&s;e who have not made this ob&s;ervation, for the &s;tatue of Juno. Many of the modern arti&s;ts ap|pear to have been de&s;irous of excelling the ancients, and to give what Homer calls the ox-eye, by mak|ing the pupil project, and &s;eem to &s;tart from the &s;ocket. Such an eye has the modern head of the erroneou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;ed Cleopatra, in the Medicean villa, and which pre&s;ents the idea of a per&s;on &s;trangled. The &s;ame kind of eye a young arti&s;t has given to the &s;tatue of the Holy Virgin in the church St. Carlo al Tor&s;o."</P>
<P>I &s;hall quote one more pa&s;&s;age from Paracel&s;us, who, though an a&s;trological enthu&s;ia&s;t, was a man of prodigious genius:</P>
<P>"To come to the practical part, and give pro|per &s;igns, with &s;ome of their &s;ignifications, it is to be remarked, that blackne&s;s in the eyes generally denotes health, a firm mind not wavering, but cou|rageous, true, and honourable. Grey eyes gene|rally denote deceit, in&s;tability, and indeci&s;ion. Short &s;ight denotes an able projector, crafty and intriguing in action. The &s;quinting, or fal&s;e|&s;ighted,
<PB N="53" REF="027203_0060_0FD3D29DF4870968">
who &s;ee on both &s;ides, or over and under, certainly denotes a deceitful, crafty per&s;on, not ea&s;ily deceived, mi&s;tru&s;tful, and not always to be tru&s;ted; one who willingly avoids labour where he can, indulging in idlene&s;s, play, u&s;ury, and pilfer|ing. Small and deep &s;unken eyes are bold in op|po&s;ition; not di&s;couraged, intriguing, and active in wickedne&s;s; capable of &s;uffering much. Large eyes denote a covetous greedy man, and e&s;pecially when they are prominent. Eyes in continual mo|tion, &s;ignify &s;hort or weak &s;ight, fear and care. The winking eye denotes an amorous di&s;po&s;ition, fore&s;ight, and quickne&s;s in projecting. The down|ca&s;t eye &s;hows &s;hame and mode&s;ty. Red eyes &s;ig|nify courage and &s;trength. Bright eyes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">low of motion, be&s;peak the hero, great acts, audacious, cheerful, one feared by his enemies."</P>

The button, or end of the no&s;e, mu&s;t be neither hard nor fle&s;hy, and its under outline mu&s;t be remarkably definite, well delineated, nei|ther pointed nor very broad. The &s;ides &s;een in front mu&s;t be well defined, and the de&s;cending no&s;trils gently &s;hortened. Viewed in profile, the bottom of the no&s;e &s;hould not have more than one third of its length. The no&s;trils above mu&s;t be pointed; below, round, and have in general a gentle curve, and be divided into two equal parts, by the profile of the upper lip. The &s;ides, or arch of the no&s;e, mu&s;t be a kind of wall. Above, it mu&s;t clo&s;e well with the arch of the eyebone, and near the eye mu&s;t be at lea&s;t half an inch in breadth. Such a no&s;e is of more worth than a kingdom. There are, indeed, innumerable ex|cellent men with defective no&s;es, but their excel|lence is of a very different kind. I have &s;een the pure&s;t, mo&s;t capable, and noble&s;t per&s;ons, with &s;mall no&s;es, and hollow in profile; but their worth mo&s;t con&s;i&s;ted in &s;uffering, li&s;tening, learning, and enjoying the beautiful influences of imagination;

provided the other parts of the form were well or|ganized. No&s;es, on the contrary, which are arched near the forehead, are capable of command, can rule, act, overcome, de&s;troy.

<P>Of the Mouth and Lips.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE contents of the mind are communicated to the mouth. How full of character is the mouth, whether at re&s;t or &s;peaking, by its infinite powers!</P>
<P>Whoever internally feels the worth of this mem|ber, &s;o different from every other member, &s;o in|&s;eparable, &s;o not to be defined, &s;o &s;imple, yet &s;o various; whoever, I &s;ay, knows and feels this worth, will &s;peak and act with divine wi&s;dom. Oh! wherefore can I only imperfectly and tremb|lingly declare all the honours of the mouth&mdash;the chief &s;eat of wi&s;dom and folly, power and debili|ty, virtue and vice, beauty and deformity, of the human mind&mdash;the &s;eat of all love, all hatred, all &s;incerity, all fal&s;ehood, all humility, all pride, all di&s;&s;imulation and all truth?</P>
<P>Oh! with what adoration would I &s;peak, and be &s;ilent, were I a more perfect man! Oh! di&s;cord|ant, degraded humanity! Oh! mournful &s;ecret of my mi&s;informed youth! When, Omni&s;cience, &s;halt thou &s;tand revealed? Unworthy as I am, yet do I adore. Yet worthy I &s;hall be; worthy as the na|ture of man will permit: for he who created me, gave me a mouth to glorify him!</P>
<P>Painters and de&s;igners, what &s;hall I &s;ay that may induce you to &s;tudy this &s;acred organ in all its
<PB N="58" REF="027203_0065_0FD3D21943360968">
beauteous expre&s;&s;ions, all its harmony and pro|portion?</P>
<P>Take pla&s;ter impre&s;&s;ions of characteri&s;tic mouths, of the living and the dead; draw after, pore over them; learn, ob&s;erve, continue day after day to &s;tudy one only; and, having perfectly &s;tudied that, you will have &s;tudied many. Oh! pardon me; my heart is oppre&s;&s;ed. Among ten or twenty draught&s;men, to whom for three years I have preached, whom I have in&s;tructed, have drawn examples for, not one have I found who felt as he ought to feel, &s;aw what was to be &s;een, or could repre&s;ent that which was evident. What can I hope?</P>
<P>Every thing may be expected from a collection of characteri&s;tic pla&s;ter impre&s;&s;ions, which might &s;o ea&s;ily be made, were &s;uch a collection only once formed. But who can &s;ay whether &s;uch ob&s;erva|tions might not declare too much? The human machine may be incapable of &s;uffering to be thus analy&s;ed. Man, perhaps, might not endure &s;uch clo&s;e in&s;pection; and, therefore, having eyes, he &s;ees not.&mdash;I &s;peak it with tears; and why I weep, thou knowe&s;t, who with me inquire&s;t into the worth of man. And you, weaker, yet candid, though on this occa&s;ion unfeeling readers, par|don me!</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve the following rules: Di&s;tingui&s;h in each mouth the upper lip &s;ingly; the under lip the &s;ame; the line formed by the union of both when tranquilly clo&s;ed, if they can be clo&s;ed without con&s;traint; the middle of the upper lip, in parti|cular; and of the under lip; the bottom of the middle line at each end; and, la&s;tly, the extend|ing of the middle line on both &s;ides. For, unle&s;s you thus di&s;tingui&s;h, you will not be able to deli|neate the mouth accurately.</P>
<P>As are the lips, &s;o is the character. Firm lips,
<PB N="59" REF="027203_0066_0FD3D25478B1DEC8">
firm character; weak lips, and quick in motion, weak and wavering character.</P>
<P>Well defined, large, and proportionate lips, the middle line of which is equally &s;erpentine on both &s;ides, and ea&s;y to be drawn, though they may denote an inclination to plea&s;ure, are never &s;een in a bad, mean, common, fal&s;e, crouching, vicious countenance.</P>
<P>A liple&s;s mouth, re&s;embling a &s;ingle line, de|notes coldne&s;s, indu&s;try, a love of order, preci|&s;ion, hou&s;ewifery; and if it be drawn upwards at the two ends, affectation, preten&s;ion, vanity, and, which may ever be the production of cool vanity, malice.</P>
<P>Very fle&s;hy lips mu&s;t ever have to contend with &s;en&s;uality and indolence: the cut-through, &s;harp-drawn lip, with anxiety and avarice.</P>
<P>Calm lips, well clo&s;ed, without con&s;traint, and well delineated, certainly betoken con&s;ideration, di&s;cretion, and firmne&s;s.</P>
<P>A mild overhanging upper lip generally &s;ignifies goodne&s;s. There are innumerable good per&s;ons al&s;o with projecting under lips: but the goodne&s;s of the latter is rather cold fidelity, and well-mean|ing, than warm active friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>The under lip, hollowed in the middle, denotes a fanciful character. Let the moment be remark|ed, when the conceit of the jocular man de&s;cends to the lip, and it will be &s;een to be a little hollow in the middle.</P>
<P>A clo&s;ed mouth, not &s;harpened, not affected, always denotes courage and fortitude; and the open mouth always clo&s;es where courage is indi&s;|pen&s;ible. Openne&s;s of mouth &s;peaks complaint; and clo&s;ene&s;s, endurance.</P>
<P>Though Phy&s;iognomi&s;ts have as yet but little no|ticed, yet much might be &s;aid concerning the lip improper, or the fle&s;hy covering of the upper teeth,
<PB N="60" REF="027203_0067_0FD3D29076994F68">
on which anatomi&s;ts have not, to my knowledge, yet be&s;towed any name, and which may be called the curtain, or pallium, extending from the be|ginning of the no&s;e to the red upper lip proper.</P>
<P>If the upper lip improper be long, the proper is alwas &s;hort; if it be &s;hort and hollow, the proper will be large and curved&mdash;another certain demon|&s;tration of the conformity of the human counte|nance. Hollow upper lips are much le&s;s common than flat and perpendicular: the character they denote is equally uncommon.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Teeth and Chin.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>NOTHING is more &s;triking, or continually vi|&s;ible, than the characteri&s;tics of the teeth, and the manner in which they di&s;play them&s;elves. The following are the ob&s;ervations I have made thereon:</P>
<P>Small, &s;hort teeth, which have generally been held by the old phy&s;iognomi&s;ts to denote weakne&s;s, I have remarked in adults of extraordinary &s;trength; but they &s;eldom were of a pure white.</P>
<P>Long teeth are certain &s;igns of weakne&s;s and pu|&s;illanimity. White, clean, well-arranged teeth, vi|&s;ible as &s;oon as the mouth opens, but not project|ing, nor always entirely &s;een, I have never met with in adults, except in good, acute, hone&s;t, can|did faithful men.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o met foul, uneven, and ugly teeth, in per&s;ons of the above good character; but it was always either &s;ickne&s;s, or &s;ome mental imperfection, which gave this deformity.</P>
<P>Whoever leaves his teeth &s;oul, and does not at|tempt
<PB N="61" REF="027203_0068_0FD3D2A141B21CD0">
to clean them, certainly betrays much of the negligence of his character, which does him no honour.</P>
<P>As are the teeth of man, that is to &s;ay, their form, po&s;ition, and cleanline&s;s (&s;o far as the latter depends on him&s;elf), &s;o is his ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Wherever the upper gum is very vi&s;ible at the fir&s;t opening of the lips, there generally much cold and phlegm.</P>
<P>Much, indeed, might be written upon the teeth, though they are generally neglected in all hi&s;torical paintings. To be convinced of this, we need but ob&s;erve the teeth of an individual during the cour&s;e of a &s;ingle day, or contemplate an apartment crowded with fools. We &s;hould not then, for a moment, deny that the teeth, in conjunction with the lips, are very characteri&s;tic; or that phy&s;iog|nomy has gained another token, which triumphs over all the arts of di&s;&s;imulation.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Chin.</HEAD>
<P>I am, from numerous experiments, convinced that the projecting chin ever denotes &s;omething po&s;itive, and the retreating &s;omething negative. The pre&s;ence or ab&s;ence of &s;trength in man is of|ten &s;ignified by the chin.</P>
<P>I have never &s;een &s;harp indentings in the middle of the chin but in men of cool under&s;tanding, un|le&s;s when &s;omething evidently contradictory ap|peared in the countenance.</P>
<P>The pointed chin is generally held to be a &s;ign of acutene&s;s and craft, though I know very worthy per&s;ons with &s;uch chins. Their craft is the craft of the be&s;t dramatic poetry.</P>
<P>The &s;oft, fat, double chin, generally points out

the epicure; and the angular chin is &s;eldom found but in di&s;creet, well di&s;po&s;ed, firm men.</P>
<P>Flatne&s;s of chin &s;peaks the cold and dry; &s;mall|ne&s;s, fear; and roundne&s;s, with a dimple, bene|volence.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of Sculls.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HOW much may the anatomi&s;t &s;ee in the mere &s;cull of man! How much more the phy&s;iog|nomi&s;t! And how much the mo&s;t the anatomi&s;t who is a phy&s;iognomi&s;t! I blu&s;h when I think how much I ought to know, and of how much I am ignorant, while writing on a part of the body of man which is &s;o &s;uperior to all that &s;cience has yet di&s;covered&mdash;to all belief, to all conception!</P>
<P>I con&s;ider the &s;y&s;tem of the bones as the great outline of man, and the &s;cull as the principal part of that &s;y&s;tem. I pay more attention to the form and arching of the &s;cull, as far as I am acquainted with it, than all my predece&s;&s;ors; and I have con|&s;idered this mo&s;t firm, lea&s;t changeable, and far be&s;t defined part of the human body, as the foun|dation of the &s;cience of phy&s;iognomy. I &s;hall therefore be permitted to be particular in my ob|&s;ervations on this member of the human body.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s that I &s;carcely know where to begin, where to end, what to &s;ay, or what to omit. I think it advi&s;eable to premi&s;e a few words concern|ing the generation and formation of human bones.</P>
<P>The whole of the human foetus is at fir&s;t &s;uppo|&s;ed to be only a &s;oft mucilaginous &s;ub&s;tance, homo|geneous
<PB N="63" REF="027203_0070_0FD3D2C138473230">
in all its parts; and that the bones them|&s;elves are but a kind of coagulated fluid, which afterwards becomes membraneous, then cartila|ginous, and at la&s;t hard bone.</P>
<P>As this vi&s;cous congelation, originally &s;o tran&s;|parent and tender, increa&s;es, it becomes thicker and more opaque, and a dark point makes its ap|pearance different from the cartilage, and of the nature of bone, but not yet perfectly hard. This point may be called the kernel of the future bone, the centre round which the o&s;&s;ification extended.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t, however, con&s;ider the coagulation attached to the cartilage as a ma&s;s without &s;hape, and only with a proper propen&s;ity for a&s;&s;uming its future form. In its earlie&s;t, tendere&s;t &s;tate, the traces of it are expre&s;&s;ed upon the cartilage, though very imperfectly.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the bony kernels, we find dif|ferences which &s;eem to determine the form of the future bones. The &s;imple and &s;maller bones have each only one kernel; but, in the more gro&s;s, thick, and angular, there are &s;everal, in different parts of the original cartilage; and it mu&s;t be re|marked, that the number of the joining bones is equivalent to the number of the kernels.</P>
<P>In the bones of the &s;cull, the round kernel fir&s;t is apparent, in the centre of each piece; and the o&s;&s;ification extends it&s;elf, like radii from the centre, in filaments, which increa&s;e in length, thickne&s;s, and &s;olidity, and are interwoven with each other like net-work. Hence the&s;e delicate, indented features of the &s;cull, when its various parts are at length joined.</P>
<P>We have hitherto only &s;poken of the fir&s;t &s;tage of o&s;&s;ification. The &s;econd begins about the fourth or fifth month, when the bones, together with the re&s;t of the parts, are more perfectly form|ed,
<PB N="64" REF="027203_0071_0FD3D256054EFA70">
and, in the progre&s;s of o&s;&s;ification, include the whole cartilage, according to the more or le&s;s life of the creature, and the original different impul&s;e and power of motion in the being.</P>
<P>Agreeable to their original formation through each &s;ucceeding period of age, they will continue to increa&s;e in thickne&s;s and hardne&s;s. But on this &s;ubject anatomi&s;ts di&s;agree&mdash;So let them. Future phy&s;iognomi&s;ts may con&s;ider this more at large. I retreat from conte&s;t, and will travel in the high road of certainty, and confine my&s;elf to what is vi&s;ible.</P>
<P>Thus much is certain, that the activity of the mu&s;cles, ve&s;&s;els, and other parts which &s;urround the bones, contribute much to their formation, and gradual increa&s;e in hardne&s;s.</P>
<P>The remains of the cartilaginous in the young bones, will, in the &s;ixth and &s;eventh month, de|crea&s;e in quantity, harden, and whiten, as the bony parts approach perfection. Some bones obtain a certain degree of firmne&s;s in much le&s;s time than others; as, for example, the &s;cull bones, and the &s;mall bones within the ear. Not only whole bones, but parts of a &s;ingle bone, are of various degrees of hardne&s;s. They will be harde&s;t at the place where the kernel of o&s;&s;ification began, and the parts adjacent; and the rigidity increa&s;es more &s;lowly and in&s;en&s;ibly, the harder the bones are, and the older the man is. What was cartilage will be|come bone; parts that were &s;eparate will grow together, and the whole bones be deprived of moi&s;ture.</P>
<P>Anatomi&s;ts divide the form into the natural or the e&s;&s;ential, which is generally the &s;ame in all bones in the human body, how different &s;oever it may be to other bodies; and into the accidental, which is &s;ubject to various changes in the &s;ame in|dividual,
<PB N="65" REF="027203_0072_0FD3D21AD812B458">
according to the influence of external objects, or, e&s;pecially, of the gradations of age.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is founded in the univer&s;ality of the nature of parents, and the circum&s;tances which naturally and invariably attend propagation. Ana|tomi&s;ts con&s;ider only the de&s;ignation of the bones individually; on this, at lea&s;t, is grounded the agreement of what they call the e&s;&s;ential form, in di&s;tinct &s;ubjects. This, therefore, only &s;peaks to the agreement of human countenances, &s;o far as they have each two eyes, one no&s;e, one mouth, and other features thus or thus di&s;po&s;ed.</P>
<P>This natural formation is certainly as different as human countenances afterwards are; which difference is the work of Nature, the original de|&s;tination of the Lord and Creator of all things. The phy&s;iognomi&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hes between original form and deviations.</P>
<P>Each bone hath its its original form, its indivi|dual capacity of form. It may, it does continual|ly alter; but it never acquires the peculiar form of another bone, which was originally different. The accidental changes of bones, however great, or dif|ferent from the original form, are yet ever govern|ed by the nature of this original individual form; nor can any power of pre&s;&s;ure ever &s;o change the original form, but that, if compared to another &s;y&s;tem of bones that has &s;uffered an equal pre&s;&s;ure, it will be perfectly di&s;tinct. As little as the Ethi|opian can change his &s;kin, or the leopard his &s;pots, whatever be the changes to which they may be &s;ubject, as little can the original form of any bone be changed into the original form of any other bone.</P>
<P>Ve&s;&s;els every where penetrate the bones, &s;upply|ing them with juices and marrow. The younger the bone is, the more are there of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els&mdash;
<PB N="66" REF="027203_0073_0FD3D2578F0F0E88">
con&s;equently the more porous and flexible are the bones, and the rever&s;e. The period when &s;uch or &s;uch changes take place in the bones cannot ea&s;ily be defined; it differs according to the nature of men and accidental circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Large and long and multiform bones, in order to facilitate their o&s;&s;ification and growth, at fir&s;t con&s;i&s;t of &s;everal pieces, the &s;maller of which are called &s;upplemental. The bone remains imperfect till the&s;e become incorporated. Hence their po&s;&s;i|ble di&s;tortion in children, by the rickets, and other di&s;ea&s;es.</P>

<P>As the infinite varieties of the external form of man is one of the indi&s;tructible pillars of phy&s;iog|nomy, no le&s;s &s;o, in my opinion, mu&s;t the infinite varieties of the &s;cull it&s;elf be.

<HEAD>Objection and An&s;wer.</HEAD>
<P>What an&s;wer &s;hall I make to that objection, with which a certain anti-phy&s;iognomi&s;t has made him&s;elf &s;o merry?</P>
<P>"In the catacombs near Rome (&s;ays he) a num|ber of &s;keletons were found, which were &s;uppo&s;ed to be the relics of &s;aints, and, as &s;uch, were ho|noured. After &s;ome time, &s;everal learned men began to doubt whether the&s;e had really been the &s;epulchres of the fir&s;t chri&s;tians and martyrs, and even to &s;u&s;pect that malefactors and banditti might have been buried there. The piety of the faithful was thus much puzzled; but if the &s;cience of phy&s;iognomy be &s;o certain, they might have re|moved all their doubts by &s;ending for Lavater, who
<PB N="68" REF="027203_0075_0FD3D21DD6200830">
with very little trouble, by merely examining and touching them, might have di&s;tingui&s;hed the bones of the &s;aints from the bones of the banditti, and thus have re&s;tored the true relics to their ju&s;t and original pre-eminence."</P>
<P>"The conceit is whim&s;ical enough (an&s;wers a cold and phlegmatic friend of phy&s;iognomy); but, having tired our&s;elves with laughing, let us exa|mine what would have been the con&s;equence had this &s;tory been fact? According to our opinion, the phy&s;iognomi&s;t would have remarked great dif|ferences in a number of bones, particularly in the &s;culls, which, to the ignorant, would have ap|peared perfectly &s;imilar; and, having cla&s;&s;ed his heads, and &s;hown their immediate gradations, and the contra&s;t of the two extremes, we may pre&s;ume, the attentive &s;pectator would have been inclined to pay &s;ome re&s;pect to his conjectures on the qua|lities and activity of brain which each formerly contained.</P>
<P>"Be&s;ides, when we reflect how certain it is that many malefactors have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of extraordi|nary abilities and energy, and how uncertain it is whether many of the &s;aints who are honoured with red-letter days in the calendar, ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch qualities, we find the que&s;tion &s;o intricate that we &s;hould be inclined to pardon the poor phy&s;iognomi&s;t were he to refu&s;e an an&s;wer, and leave the deci&s;ion to the great infallible judge."</P>

<P>Let us endeavour farther to inve&s;tigate the que&s;|tion; for, though this an&s;wer is good, it is in&s;uffi|cient. Who ever yet pretended ab&s;olutely to di|&s;tingui&s;h &s;aints from banditti, by in&s;pecting only the &s;cull?</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="027203_0076_0FD3D20758687D48">
To me it appears, that ju&s;tice requires we &s;hould in all our deci&s;ions concerning books, men, and opinions, judge each according to their preten&s;i|ons, and not a&s;cribe preten&s;ions which have not been made to any man.</P>
<P>I have heard of no phy&s;iognomi&s;t who has had, and I am certain that I my&s;elf never have had, any &s;uch pre&s;umption. Notwith&s;tanding which I maintain as a truth mo&s;t demon&s;trable, that, by the mere form, proportion, hardne&s;s, or weakne&s;s of the &s;cull, the &s;trength or weakne&s;s of the general character may be known with the greate&s;t certain|ty. But, as hath been often repeated, &s;trength and weakne&s;s are neither virtue nor vice, &s;aint nor malefactor.</P>
<P>Power, like riches, may be employed to the ad|vantage or detriment of &s;ociety, the &s;ame as wealth may be in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;aint or a demon; and as it is with wealth, or arbitrary po&s;itive power, &s;o is it with natural innate power. As in an hundred rich men there are ninety-nine who are not &s;aints, &s;o will there &s;carcely be one &s;aint among an hundred men born with this power.</P>
<P>When, therefore, we remark in a &s;cull great original and percu&s;&s;ive power, we cannot indeed &s;ay this man was a malefactor; but we may affirm there was this exce&s;s of power, which, if it were not qualified and tempered during life, there is the highe&s;t probability it would have been agitated by the &s;pirit of conque&s;t, would have become a general, a conqueror, a Cae&s;ar, a Cartouch. Un|der certain circum&s;tances he would probably have acted in a certain manner, and his actions would have varied according to the variation of circum|&s;tances; but he would always have acted with ar|dour, tempe&s;tuou&s;ly, always as a ruler and a con|queror.</P>
<P>Thus, al&s;o, we may affirm of certain other &s;culls,
<PB N="70" REF="027203_0077_0FD3D21F64D1DB88">
which, in their whole &s;tructure and form, di&s;cover tenderne&s;s, and a re&s;emblance to parchment, that they denote weakne&s;s; a mere capability of per|ceptive, without percu&s;&s;ive, without creative power. Therefore, under certain circum&s;tances, &s;uch per|&s;ons would have acted weakly. They would not have had the native power of with&s;tanding this or that temptation, of engaging in this or that enter|pri&s;e. In the fa&s;hionable world, they would have acted the fop, the libertine in a more confined cir|cle, and the enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;aint in a convent.</P>
<P>Oh! how differently may the &s;ame power, the &s;ame &s;en&s;ibility, the &s;ame capacity, act, feel, and conceive, under different circum&s;tances! And hence we may, in part, comprehend the po&s;&s;ibility of prede&s;tination and liberty in one and the &s;ame &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Take a man of the commone&s;t under&s;tanding to a charnel-hou&s;e, and make him attentive to the dif|ferences of &s;culls; in a &s;hort time he will either perceive of him&s;elf, or under&s;tand when told, here is &s;trength, there weakne&s;s; here ob&s;tinacy, and there indeci&s;ion.</P>
<P>If &s;hown the bald head of Cae&s;ar, as painted by Rubens or Titian, or that of Michael Angelo, what man would be dull enough not to di&s;cover that impul&s;ive power, that rocky comprehen&s;ion, by which they were peculiarly characteri&s;ed; and that more ardour, more action mu&s;t be expected, than from a &s;mooth, round, flat head?</P>
<P>How characteri&s;tic is the &s;cull of Charles XII! How different from the &s;cull of his biographer Voltaire! Compare the &s;cull of Judas with the &s;cull of Chri&s;t, after Holbein, di&s;carding the mu&s;|cular parts, and I doubt, if a&s;ked which was the wicked betrayer, which the innocent betrayed, whether any ony one would he&s;itate.</P>
<P>I will acknowledge, that when two determinate

heads are pre&s;ented to us, with &s;uch &s;triking dif|ferences, and the one of which is known to be that of a malefactor, the other that of a &s;aint, it is infinitely more ea&s;y to decide; but he who can di&s;tingui&s;h between them, &s;hould not therefore af|firm he can di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;culls of &s;aints from the &s;culls of malefactors.</P>

I think I have heard the &s;ame remark made of the Swi&s;s and the Burgundians. This at lea&s;t proves it is granted that we may perceive, in the &s;cull only, a difference of &s;trength and manners, as well as of nations.</P>

<P>Of the Difference of Sculls, as they relate to Sex, and particularly to Nations.&mdash;Of the Sculls of Chil|dren.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>AN e&s;&s;ay on the difference of bones, as they re|late to &s;ex, and particularly to nations, has been publi&s;hed by M. Fi&s;cher, which is well de|&s;erving of attention. The following are &s;ome thoughts on the &s;ubject, concerning which nothing will be expected from me, but very much from M. Kamper.</P>
<P>Con&s;ideration and compari&s;on of the external and internal make of the body, in male and fe|male, teaches us, that the one is de&s;tined for la|bour and &s;trength, and the other for beauty and
<PB N="72" REF="027203_0079_0FD3D2590F720678">
propagation. The bones particularly denote ma&s;|culine &s;trength in the former; and, &s;o far as the &s;tronger and the prominent are more ea&s;y to de|&s;cribe than the le&s;s prominent and the weaker, &s;o far is the male &s;keleton and the &s;cull the ea&s;ie&s;t to define.</P>
<P>The general &s;tructure of the bones in the male, and of the &s;cull in particular, is evidently of &s;trong|er formation than in the female. The body of the male increa&s;es, from the hip to the &s;houlder, in breadth and thickne&s;s; hence the broad &s;houl|ders and &s;quare form of the &s;trong: whereas the female &s;keleton gradually grows thinner and weaker from the hip upwards, and by degrees appears as if it were rounded.</P>
<P>Even &s;ingle bones in the female are more tender, &s;mooth, and round; have fewer &s;harp edges, cut|ing and prominent corners.</P>
<P>We may here properly cite the remark of San|torinus, concerning the difference of &s;culls, as they relate to &s;ex. "The aperture of the mouth, the palate, and in general the parts which form the voice, are le&s;s in the female; and the more &s;mall and round chin, con&s;equently the under part of the mouth corre&s;pond."</P>
<P>The round or angular form of the &s;cull may be very powerfully and e&s;&s;entially turned to the ad|vantage of the phy&s;iognomi&s;t, and becomes a &s;ource of innumerable individual judgments. Of this the whole work abounds with proofs and examples.</P>
<P>No man is perfectly like another, either in exter|nal con&s;truction or internal parts, whether great or &s;mall, or in the &s;y&s;tem of the bones. I find this difference, not only between nations, but between per&s;ons of the neare&s;t kindred; but not &s;o great between the&s;e, and between per&s;ons of the &s;ame nation, as between nations remote from each other, who&s;e manners and food are very different. The
<PB N="73" REF="027203_0080_0FD3D220CA657020">
more confidently men conver&s;e with, the more they re&s;emble each other, as well in the formation of the parts of the body, as in language, manners, and food; that is, &s;o far as the formation of the body can be influenced by external accidents. Tho&s;e nations, in a certain degree, will re&s;emble each other, that have commercial intercour&s;e, they being acted upon by the effect of climate, imita|tation and habit, which have &s;o great an influ|ence in forming the body and mind; that is to &s;ay, the vi&s;ible and invi&s;ible powers of man; al|though national character &s;till remains, and which character in reality, is much ea&s;ier to remark than to de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>We &s;hall leave more exten&s;ive inquiries and ob|&s;ervations concerning this &s;ubject to &s;ome &s;uch per&s;on as Kamper, and refrain as becomes us; not having obtained &s;ufficient knowledge of the &s;ubject to make remarks of our own of &s;ufficient importance.</P>
<P>Differences with re&s;pect to &s;trength, firmne&s;s, &s;tructure, and proportion of the parts, are cer|tainly vi&s;ible in all the bones of the &s;keletons of different nations; but mo&s;t in the formation of the countenance, which every where contains the pe|culiar expre&s;&s;ion of nature, of the mind.</P>
<P>The &s;cull of a Dutchman, for example, is in ge|neral rounder, with broader bones, curved, and arched in all its parts, and with the &s;ides le&s;s flat and compre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>A Calmuc &s;cull will be more rude and gro&s;s; flat on the top, prominent at the &s;ides; the parts firm and compre&s;&s;ed, the face broad and flat.</P>
<P>The &s;cull of the Ethiopian is &s;teep, &s;uddenly elevated; as &s;uddenly &s;mall, &s;harp, above the eyes; beneath &s;trongly projecting; circular, and high behind.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Sculls of Children.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;cull, or head, of a child, drawn upon pa|per without additional circum&s;tance, will be gene|rally known, and &s;eldom confounded with the head of an adult. But, to keep them di&s;tinct, it is nece&s;&s;ary the painter &s;hould not be too ha&s;ty and incorrect in his ob&s;ervations of what is peculiar, or &s;o frequently generalize the particular, which is the eternal error of painters, and of &s;o many pre|tended phy&s;iognomi&s;ts.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding individual variety, there are certain con&s;tant &s;igns proper to the head of a child, which as much con&s;i&s;t in the combination and form of the whole as in the &s;ingle parts.</P>
<P>It is well known that the head is larger in pro|portion to the re&s;t of the body, the younger the per&s;on is; and &s;eems to me, from comparing the &s;cull of the embryo, the child, and the man, that the part of &s;cull which contains the brain is pro|portionably larger than the parts that compo&s;e the jaw and the countenance. Hence it happens that the forehead in children, e&s;pecially the upper part, is generally &s;o prominent.</P>
<P>The bones of the upper and under jaw, with the teeth they contain, are later in their growth, and more &s;lowly attain perfect formation. The under part of the head generally increa&s;es more than the upper, till it has attained full growth. Several proce&s;&s;es of the bones, as the <HI>proce&s;&s;us mamillares,</HI> which lie behind and under the ears, form them|&s;elves after the birth; as do al&s;o, in a great mea|&s;ure,
<PB N="75" REF="027203_0082_0FD3D285F364C8B8">
various hidden &s;inu&s;&s;es, or cavities, in the&s;e bones. The quill-form of the&s;e bones, with their various points, ends and protuberances, and the numerous mu&s;cles which are annexed to them, and continually in action, make the greater increa&s;e and change more po&s;&s;ible and ea&s;y than can happen in the &s;pherical bony covering of the brain, when once the futures are entirely become &s;olid.</P>
<P>This unequal growth of the two principal parts of the &s;cull mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily produce an e&s;&s;ential difference in the whole, without enumerating the obtu&s;e extremities, the edges, &s;harp corners, and &s;ingle protuberances, which are chiefly occa&s;ioned by the action of the mu&s;cles.</P>
<P>As the man grows, the countenance below the forehead becomes more protuberant; and as the &s;ides of the face, that is to &s;ay, the temple-bones, which are al&s;o &s;low in coming to perfection, con|tinually remove farther from each other, the &s;cull gradually lo&s;es that pear form which it appears to me to have had in embryo.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;inus frontales</HI> fir&s;t form them&s;elves after birth. The prominence at the bottom of the fore|head, between the eyebrows, is likewi&s;e wanting in children. The forehead joins the no&s;e without any remarkable curve. This latter circum&s;tance may al&s;o be ob&s;erved in &s;ome grown per&s;ons, when the <HI>&s;inus frontales</HI> are either wanting or very &s;mall; for the&s;e cavities are found very different in diffe|rent &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>The no&s;e, during growth, alters exceedingly; but I am unable to explain in what manner the bones contribute to this alteration, it being chiefly cartilaginous. Accurately to determine this, many experiments on the heads and &s;culls of children, and grown per&s;ons, would be nece&s;&s;ary; or, ra|ther, if we could compare the &s;ame head with

<P>The Phy&s;iognomi&s;t.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>ALL men have talents for all things; yet we may venture to a&s;&s;ert, that very few have the determinate and e&s;&s;ential talents. All men have talents for drawing: they can all learn to write, well or ill; yet not an excellent draft&s;man will be produced in ten thou&s;and. The &s;ame may be af|firmed of eloquence, poetry, and phy&s;iognomy. All men who have eyes and ears, have talents to become phy&s;iognomi&s;ts; yet not one in ten thou|&s;and can become an excellent phy&s;iognomi&s;t.</P>
<P>It may, therefore be of u&s;e to &s;ketch the cha|racter of the true phy&s;iognomi&s;t, that tho&s;e who are deficient of the requi&s;ite talents may be deter|ed from the &s;tudy of phy&s;iognomy. The pre|tended phy&s;iognomi&s;t, with a fooli&s;h head and a wicked heart, is certainly one of the mo&s;t con|temptible and mi&s;chievous creatures that crawls on the face of the earth.</P>
<P>No one who&s;e per&s;on is not well formed, can become a good phy&s;iognomi&s;t. Tho&s;e painters were the be&s;t, who&s;e per&s;ons were the hand&s;ome&s;t. Reubens, Vandyke, and Raphael, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing three gradations of beauty, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed three gradations of the genius of painting. The phy&s;iognomi&s;ts of the greate&s;t &s;ymmetry are the be&s;t. As the mo&s;t virtu|ous can the be&s;t determine on virtue, and the ju&s;t on ju&s;tice; &s;o can the mo&s;t hand&s;ome countenances on the goodne&s;s, beauty, and noble traits of the human countenance, and con&s;equently on its de|fects and ignoble properties. The &s;carcity of hu|man beauty is the rea&s;on why phy&s;iognomy is &s;o much decried, and finds &s;o many opponents.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="027203_0087_0FD3D25B4E5E44B8">
No per&s;on, therefore, ought to enter the &s;anc|tuary of phy&s;iognomy, who has a deba&s;ed mind, an ill-formed forehead, a blinking eye, or a di&s;torted mouth. "The light of the body is the eye: if, therefore, thine eye be &s;ingle, thy whole body &s;hall be full of light; but if thine eye be evil, thy whole body &s;hall be full of darkne&s;s: if, therefore, that light that is in thee be darkne&s;s, how great is that darkne&s;s!"</P>
<P>Any one who would become a phy&s;iognomi&s;t, cannot meditate too much on this text. O &s;ingle eye! that beholde&s;t all things as they are, &s;ee&s;t no|thing fal&s;ely, with glance oblique nothing over|looke&s;t! O mo&s;t perfect image of rea&s;on and wi&s;|dom!&mdash;Why do I &s;ay image? Thou art rea&s;on and wi&s;dom them&s;elves! Without thy re&s;plendent light, would all that appertains to phy&s;iognomy be|come dark!</P>

<P>Whoever does not dwell with fixed rapture on

the a&s;pect of benevolence in action, &s;uppo&s;ing it&s;elf unob&s;erved; whoever remains unmoved by the voice of innocence, the guilele&s;s look of unviolated cha&s;tity, the mother contemplating her beauteous &s;leeping infant, the warm pre&s;&s;ure of the hand of a friend, or his eye &s;wimming in tears; whoever can lightly tear him&s;elf from &s;cenes like the&s;e, and turn them to ridicule, might much ea&s;ier commit the crime of parricide than become a phy&s;iogno|mi&s;t.</P>
<P>If &s;uch be the ca&s;e, what then is required of the phy&s;iognomi&s;t? What &s;hould his inclination, ta|lents, qualities, and capabilities be?</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, as hath been in part already remarked, his fir&s;t of requi&s;ites &s;hould be a body well proportioned, and finely organized; accu|racy of &s;en&s;ation, capable of receiving the mo&s;t minute outward impre&s;&s;ions, and ea&s;ily tran&s;mit|ing them faithfully to memory; or, as I ought rather to &s;ay, impre&s;&s;ing them upon the imagina|tion, and the fibres of the brain. His eye, in par|ticular, mu&s;t be excellent, clear, acute, rapid, and firm.</P>
<P>Preci&s;ion in ob&s;ervation is the very &s;oul of phy|&s;iognomy. The phy&s;iognomi&s;t mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s a mo&s;t delicate, &s;wift, certain, mo&s;t exten&s;ive &s;pirit of ob&s;ervation. To ob&s;erve is to be attentive, &s;o as to fix the mind on a particular object, which it &s;e|lects, or may &s;elect, for con&s;ideration, from a num|ber of &s;urrounding objects. To be attentive, is to con&s;ider &s;ome one particular object, exclu&s;ively of all others; and to analyze, con&s;equently to di&s;tin|gui&s;h what is &s;imilar, what di&s;&s;imilar, to di&s;cover proportion and di&s;proportion, is the office of the under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>If the phy&s;iognomi&s;t has not an accurate, &s;upe|rior, and extended under&s;tanding, he will neither be able rightly to ob&s;erve, nor to compare and cla&s;s

his ob&s;ervations, much le&s;s to draw the nece&s;&s;ary conclu&s;ions. Phy&s;iognomy is the highe&s;t exerci&s;e of the under&s;tanding, the logic of corporeal vari|eties.</P>
<P>To the cleare&s;t and profounde&s;t under&s;tanding, the true phy&s;iognomi&s;t unites the mo&s;t lively, &s;trong, comprehen&s;ive imagination, and a fine and rapid wit. Imagination is nece&s;&s;ary to impre&s;s the traits with exactne&s;s, &s;o that they may be renewed at plea&s;ure; and to range the pictures in the mind as perfectly as if they &s;till were vi&s;ible, and with all po&s;&s;ible order.</P>
<P>A keen penetration is indi&s;pen&s;able to the phy|&s;iognomi&s;t, that he may ea&s;ily perceive the re&s;em|blance that exi&s;ts between objects. Thus, for ex|ample, he &s;ees a head or forehead po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of cer|tain characteri&s;tic marks: the&s;e marks pre&s;ent them&s;elves to his imagination, and a keen pene|tration di&s;covers to what they are &s;imilar. Hence greater preci&s;ion, certainty, and expre&s;&s;ion, are imparted to his images. He mu&s;t have the capa|city of uniting the approximation of each trait that he remarks, and be able to define the degree of this approximation. No one who is not inexhau&s;tibly copious in language, can become a phy&s;iognomi&s;t; and the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible copiou&s;ne&s;s is poor, com|paratively with the wants of phy&s;iognomy. All that language can expre&s;s, the phy&s;iognomi&s;t mu&s;t be able to expre&s;s. He mu&s;t be the creator of a new language, which mu&s;t be equally preci&s;e and alluring, natural and intelligible.</P>
<P>Every production of art, ta&s;te, and mind; all vocabularies of all nations, all the kingdoms of nature mu&s;t obey his command, mu&s;t &s;upply his nece&s;&s;ities.</P>
<P>The art of drawing is indi&s;pen&s;able, if he would be preci&s;e in his definitions, and accurate in his deci&s;ions. Drawing is the fir&s;t, mo&s;t natural, and

The phy&s;i|ognomi&s;t, who cannot draw ha&s;tily, accurately, and characteri&s;tically, will be unable to make, much le&s;s to retain, or communicate, innumerable ob|&s;ervations.</P>
<P>The knowledge of anatomy is indi&s;pen&s;able to him; as al&s;o is phy&s;iology, or the &s;cience of the human body in health; not only that he may be able to remark any di&s;proportion, as well in the &s;olids as in the mu&s;cular parts, but that he may likewi&s;e be capable of naming the&s;e parts in his phy&s;iognomical language. He mu&s;t al&s;o be ac|quainted with the temperament of the human bo|dy: not only its different colours and appearances, occa&s;ioned by the mixture of the blood; but al&s;o the con&s;tituent parts of the blood it&s;elf, and their different proportions. Still more e&s;pecially mu&s;t be under&s;tood the external &s;ymptoms of the con&s;ti|tution, relative to the nervous &s;y&s;tem, for on this depends more than even on the knowledge of the blood.</P>
<P>What an exten&s;ive knowledge ought he to have of the human heart, and the manners of the world! How thoroughly ought he to in&s;pect, to feel him|&s;elf! That mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential, yet mo&s;t difficult of all knowledge to the phy&s;iognomi&s;t, ought to be po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by him in all po&s;&s;ible perfection. In propor|tion only as he knows him&s;elf, will he be enabled to know others.</P>
<P>Not only is this &s;elf-knowledge, this &s;tudying of man by the &s;tudy of his own heart, with the gene|alogy and con&s;anguinity of inclinations and pa&s;&s;i|ons, their various &s;ymptoms and changes, nece&s;|&s;ary

<P>"The peculiar &s;hades (I here cite the words of one of the critics on my fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay), the peculiar &s;hades of feeling which mo&s;t affect the ob&s;erver <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">f any object, frequently have relation to his own mind, and will be &s;oone&s;t remarked by him in pro|portion as they &s;ympathize with his own powers. They will affect him mo&s;t according to the man|ner in which he is accu&s;tomed to &s;urvey the phy&s;i|cal and moral world.

For this rea&s;on, the phy&s;iognomi&s;t mu&s;t, if he knows him&s;elf, which he in ju&s;tice ought to do before he attempts to know others, once more compare his remarks with his own pe|culiar mode of thinking, and &s;eparate tho&s;e which are general from tho&s;e which are individual and appertain to him&s;elf." I &s;hall make no commenta|ry on this important precept.

<P>But, to draw to a conclu&s;ion, the phy&s;iognomi&s;t &s;hould know the world; he &s;hould have intercour&s;e with all manner of men, in all various ranks and conditions; he &s;hould have travelled, &s;hould po&s;|&s;e&s;s exten&s;ive knowledge, a thorough acquaintance with arti&s;ts, mankind, vice, and virtue, the wi&s;e and the fooli&s;h, and particularly with children; together with a love of literature, and a ta&s;te for painting, and the other imitative arts. I &s;ay, can it need demon&s;tration, that all tho&s;e, and much more, are to him indi&s;pen&s;able? To &s;um up the whole: to a well formed, well organized body, the perfect phy&s;iognomi&s;t mu&s;t unite an acute &s;pirit of ob&s;ervation, a lively fancy, an excellent judgment, and, with numerous propen&s;ities to the arts and &s;ciences, a &s;trong, benevolent, enthu&s;ia&s;tic, inno|cent heart; a heart confident in it&s;elf, and free from the pa&s;&s;ions inimical to man.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Lavater's own Remarks on National Phy&s;iognomy.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT is undeniable, that there is national phy&s;iog|nomy, as well as national character. Whoever doubts of this can never have ob&s;erved men of dif|ferent nations, nor have compared the inhabitants of the extreme confines of any two. Compare a Negro and an Engli&s;hman, a native of Lapland and an Italian, a Frenchman and an inhabitant of Terra del Fuego. Examine their forms, counte|nances, characters, and minds. Their difference will be ea&s;ily &s;een, though it will &s;ometimes be very difficult to de&s;cribe it &s;cientifically.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to me probable, that we &s;hall di&s;cover what is national in the countenance, better from the &s;ight of an individal at fir&s;t, than of a whole people; at lea&s;t &s;o it appears to me, from my own experience. Individual countenances di&s;cover more the characteri&s;tic of a whole nation, than a whole nation does that which is national in indivi|duals. The following, infinitely little, is what I have hitherto ob&s;erved from the foreigners with whom I have conver&s;ed, and whom I have noticed, con|cerning national character.</P>
<P>The French I am lea&s;t able to characteri&s;e. They have no traits &s;o bold as the Engli&s;h, nor &s;o minute as the Germans. I know them chiefly by their teeth and their laugh. The Italians I di&s;co|ver by the no&s;e, &s;mall eyes, and projecting chin. The Engli&s;h by their foreheads and eyebrows. The Dutch by the rotundity of the head, and the weakne&s;s of the hair. The Germans by the angles and wrinkles round the eyes and in the cheeks.
<PB N="87" REF="027203_0095_0FD3D229DB5709E8">
The Ru&s;&s;ians by the &s;nub no&s;e, and their light-coloured or black hair.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now &s;ay a word concerning Engli&s;hmen in particular. Engli&s;hmen have the &s;horte&s;t and be&s;t arched foreheads; that is to &s;ay, they are arched only upwards, and, towards the eyebrows, either gently decline, or are rectilinear. They very &s;eldom have pointed, but often round, full, me|dullary no&s;es; the Quakers and Moravians ex|cepted, who, wherever they are found, are gene|rally thin lipped. Engli&s;hmen have large, well defined, beautifully curved lips. They have al&s;o a round full chin; but they are peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;h|ed by the eyebrows and eyes, which are &s;trong, open, liberal, and &s;tedfa&s;t. The outline of their countenance is, in general, great; and they never have tho&s;e numerous, infinitely minute traits, an|gles, and wrinkles, by which the Germans are &s;o e&s;pecially di&s;tingui&s;hed. Their complexion is fair|er than that of the Germans.</P>
<P>All Engli&s;h women whom I have known per&s;o|nally or by portrait, appear to be compo&s;ed of mar|row and nerve. They are inclined to be tall, &s;len|der, &s;oft, and as di&s;tant from all that is har&s;h, rigo|rous, or &s;tubborn, as heaven is from earth.</P>
<P>The Swi&s;s have generally no common phy&s;iog|nomy or national character, the a&s;pect of fidelity excepted. They are as different from each other as nations the mo&s;t remote. The French Swi&s;s pea&s;ant is as di&s;tinct as po&s;&s;ible from the pea&s;ant of Appenzel. It may be that the eye of a foreigner would better di&s;cover the general character of the nation, and in what it differs from the French or German than that of a native.</P>
<P>In each canton of Switzerland I find character|i&s;tic varieties. The inhabitants of Zurich, for in|&s;tance, are middle &s;ized, more frequently meagre
<PB N="88" REF="027203_0096_0FD3D28BF80FD268">
than corpulent, but u&s;ually one or the other. They &s;eldom have ardent eyes, and the outline is not of|ten grand or minute. The men are &s;eldom hand|&s;ome, though the youth are incomparably &s;o; but they &s;oon alter. The people of Bern are tall, &s;traight, fair, pliable, and firm, and are mo&s;t di&s;|tingui&s;hed by their upper teeth, which are white, regular, and ea&s;ily to be &s;een. The inhabitants of Ba&s;le (or Ba&s;il) are more round, full, and ten&s;e of countenance, the complexion tinged with yellow, and the lips open and flaccid. Tho&s;e of Schaf|hau&s;en are hard boned. Their eyes are &s;eldom &s;unken, but generally prominent. The &s;ides of the forehead diverge over the temples, the cheeks fle&s;hy, and the mouth wide and open. They are commonly &s;tronger built than the people of Zurich, though in the canton of Zurich there is &s;carcely a village in which the inhabitants do not differ from tho&s;e of the neighbouring village, without attending to dre&s;s, which, notwith&s;tanding, is al&s;o phy&s;iognomical.</P>
<P>Round Waden&s;chweil and Oberreid I have &s;een many hand&s;ome, broad-&s;houldered, &s;trong, burden bearing men. At Weiningen, two leagues from Zurich, I met a company of well-formed men, who were di&s;tingui&s;hable for their cleanline&s;s, circum|&s;pection, and gravity of deportment.</P>
<P>An extremely intere&s;ting and in&s;tructive book might be written on the phy&s;iognomical charac|ter of the pea&s;ants of Switzerland. There are con&s;iderable di&s;tricts where the countenances, the no&s;e not excepted, are mo&s;t of them broad, as if pre&s;&s;ed flat with a board. This di&s;agreeable form, wherever found, is con&s;i&s;tent with the character of the people. What could be more in&s;tructive than a phy&s;iognomical and characteri&s;tic de&s;cription of &s;uch villages, their mode of living, food, and oc|cupation?</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Extracts from Buffon on National Phy&s;iognomy.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>TRAVERSING the &s;urface of the earth, and beginning in the north, we find, in Lapland, and on the northern coa&s;t of Tartary, a race of men &s;mall of &s;tature, &s;ingular of form, and with countenances as &s;avage as their manners.</P>
<P>The&s;e people have large flat faces, the no&s;e broad, the pupil of the eye of a yellow brown incli|ning to a black, the eyelids retiring towards the temples, the cheeks extremely high, the mouth ve|ry large, the lower part of the face narrow, the lips full and high, the voice &s;hrill, the head large, the hair black and &s;leek, and the complexion brown or tanned. They are very &s;mall, and &s;quat, though meagre. Mo&s;t of them are not above four feet, and hardly any exceed four feet and an half. The Borandians are &s;till &s;maller than the Laplanders. The Samoiedes more &s;quat, with large heads and no&s;es, and darker complexions. Their legs are &s;horter, their knees more turned outwards; their hair is longer, and they have le&s;s beard. The complexion of the Greenlanders is darker &s;till, and of a deep olive colour.</P>
<P>The women, among all the&s;e nations, are as ugly as the men; and not only do the&s;e people re&s;em|ble each other in ugline&s;s, &s;ize, and the colour of their eyes and hair, but they have &s;imilar inclinati|ons and manners, and are all equally gro&s;s, &s;uper|&s;titious, and &s;tupid. Mo&s;t of them are idolaters; they are more rude than &s;avage, wanting courage, &s;elf-re&s;pect, and mode&s;ty.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="027203_0098_0FD3D34E37C2E318">
If we examine the neighbouring people of the long &s;lip of land which the Laplanders inhabit, we &s;hall find they have no relation whatever with that race, excepting that of the O&s;tiacks and Tongu&s;i|ans. The Samoiedes and the Borandians have no re&s;emblance with the Ru&s;&s;ians, nor have the Lap|landers with the Finlanders, the Goths, Danes, or Norwegians. The Greenlanders are alike different from the &s;avages of Canada. The latter are tall and well made; and though they differ very much from each other, yet they are &s;till more infinitely different from the Laplanders. The O&s;tiacks &s;eem to be Samoiedes, &s;omething le&s;s ugly, and dwarf|i&s;h, for they are &s;mall and ill formed.</P>
<P>All the Tartars have the upper part of the coun|tenance very large and wrinkled, even in youth; the no&s;e &s;hort and gro&s;s, the eyes &s;mall and &s;unk|en, the cheeks very high, the lower part of the face narrow, the chin long and prominent, the upper jaw &s;unken, the teeth long and &s;eparated, the eye|brows large, covering the eyes, the eyelids thick, the face flat, their &s;kin of an olive colour, and their hair black. They are of a middle &s;tature, but very &s;trong and robu&s;t; have little beard, which grows in &s;mall tufts, like that of the Chine&s;e; thick thighs, and &s;hort legs.</P>
<P>The Little or Nogais Tartars have lo&s;t a part of their ugline&s;s, by having intermingled with the Cir|ca&s;&s;ians, As we proceed ea&s;tward, into free or in|dependent Tartary, the features of the Tartars be|come &s;omething le&s;s hard, but the e&s;&s;ential charac|teri&s;tics of their race ever remain. The Mogul Tartars, who conquered China, and who were the mo&s;t poli&s;hed of the&s;e nations, are, at pre&s;ent, the lea&s;t ugly and ill made; yet have they, like the others, &s;mall eyes, the face large and flat, little beard, but always black or red, and the no&s;e &s;hort and compre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="027203_0099_0FD3D3A860B77148">
Among the Kergi&s;i and Tcheremi&s;i Tartars there is a whole nation, or tribe, among whom are very &s;ingularly beautiful men and women. The manners of the Chine&s;e and Tartars are wholly oppo&s;ite, more &s;o than are their countenances and forms. The limbs of the Chine&s;e are well proportioned, large, and fat. Their faces are round and capa|cious, their eyes &s;mall, their eyebrows large, their eyelids rai&s;ed, and their no&s;es little and compre&s;&s;ed. They only have &s;even or eight tufts of black hair on each lip, and very little on the chin.</P>
<P>The natives of the coa&s;t of New Holland, which lies in &s;ixteen degrees fifteen minutes of &s;outh lati|tude, and to the &s;outh of the i&s;le of Timor, are perhaps the mo&s;t mi&s;erable people on earth, and of all the human race mo&s;t approach the brute ani|mal. They are tall, upright and &s;lender. Their limbs are long and &s;upple, their heads great, their forehead round, their eyebrows thick, and their eyelids half &s;hut. This they acquire by habit in their infancy, to pre&s;erve their eyes from the gnats, by which they are greatly incommoded; and as they never much open their eyes, they cannot &s;ee at a di&s;tance, at lea&s;t not unle&s;s they rai&s;e the head as if they wi&s;hed to look at &s;omething above them. They have large no&s;es, thick lips, and wide mouths. It &s;hould &s;eem that they draw the two upper fore teeth, for neither man nor woman, young nor old, have the&s;e teeth. They have no beard; their faces are long, and very di&s;agreeable, without a &s;ingle plea&s;ing feature; their hair not long and &s;leek, like that of mo&s;t of the Indians, but &s;hort, black, and curly, like the hair of the Negroes. Their &s;kin is black, and re&s;embles that of the Indians of the coa&s;t of Guinea.</P>
<P>If we now examine the nations inhabiting a more temperate climate, we &s;hall find, that the people of the northern provinces, of the Mogul empire,
<PB N="92" REF="027203_0100_0FD3D3A9CA840C10">
Per&s;ia, the Armenians, Turks, Georgians, Mingre|lians, Circa&s;&s;ians, Greeks, and all the inhabitants of Europe, are the hand&s;ome&s;t, wi&s;e&s;t, and be&s;t formed of any on earth; and that, though the di&s;tance between the Cachemire and Spain, or Cir|ca&s;&s;ia and France, is very great, there is &s;till a very &s;ingular re&s;emblance between people &s;o far from each other, but &s;ituated in nearly the &s;ame latitude. The people of Cachemire are renowned for beau|ty, are as well formed as the Europeans, and have nothing of the Tartar countenance, the flat no&s;e, and the &s;mall pig's eyes, which are &s;o univer&s;al among their neighbours.</P>
<P>The complexion of the Georgians is &s;till more beautiful than that of Cachemire; no ugly face is found in the country, and nature has endowed mo&s;t of the women with graces which are no where el&s;e to be di&s;covered. The men al&s;o are very hand|&s;ome, have natural under&s;tanding, and would be capable of arts and &s;ciences, did not their bad edu|cation render them exceedingly ignorant and vici|ous&punc; yet, with all their vices, the Georgians are civil, humane, grave, and moderate&punc; they &s;eldom are under the influence of anger, though they be|come irreconcil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">able enemies having once enter|tained hatred.</P>
<P>The Circa&s;&s;ians and Mingrelians are equally beautiful and well formed. The lame and the crooked are &s;eldom &s;een among the Turks.

<P>Men with black or dark-brown hair begin to be rather uncommon in England, Flanders, Holland, and the northern provinces of Germany; and few &s;uch are to be found in Denmark, Sweden, and Poland. According to Linnaeus, the Goths are very tall, have &s;leek, light-coloured, &s;ilver hair, and blue eyes.

<P>If we collect the accounts of travellers, it will appear, that there are as many varieties among the race of Negroes as the Whites. They al&s;o have their Tartars and their Circa&s;&s;ians.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE &s;uppo&s;ition of Maupertuis, that a race of men might be e&s;tabli&s;hed in any province, in whom under&s;tanding, probity, and &s;trength, &s;hould be hereditary, could only be realized by the po&s;&s;i|bility of &s;eparating the degenerate from the con|formable births; a project which, in my opinion, might be practicable, but which, in the pre&s;ent order of things, is prevented by the wi&s;er di&s;po&s;i|tions of nature, according to which the wicked and the good are intermingled, that by the irregula|rities and vices of the former, the latent powers of the latter may be put in motion, and impelled to approach perfection. If nature, without tran&s;|plantation or foreign mixture, be left undi&s;turbed, &s;he will after many generations, produce a la&s;ting race that &s;hall ever remain di&s;tinct.</P>
<P>If we divide the human race into four principal cla&s;&s;es it is probable that the intermediate ones, however perpetuating and con&s;picuous, may be immediately reduced to one of the&s;e. 1. The race of Whites. 2. The Negroes. 3. The Huns, (Monguls, or Calmucs). 4. The Hindoos or peo|ple of Hindo&s;tan.</P>
<P>External things may well be the accidental, but not the primary cau&s;es of what is inherited or a&s;&s;i|milated. As little as chance, or phy&s;ico-mecha|nical cau&s;es, can produce an organized body, as little can they add any thing to its power of propa|gation; that is to &s;ay, produce a thing which &s;hall
<PB N="96" REF="027203_0104_0FD3D35ACD7D9D00">
propagate it&s;elf by having a peculiar form or pro|portion of parts.</P>
<P>Man was undoubtedly intended to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e the inha|bitant of all climates, and all &s;oils. Hence the feeds of many internal propen&s;ities mu&s;t be latent in him, which &s;hall remain inactive, or be put in motion, according to his &s;ituation on the earth. So that, in progre&s;&s;ive generations, he &s;hall appear as if born for that particular &s;oil in which he &s;eems planted.</P>
<P>The air and the &s;un appear to be the cau&s;es which mo&s;t influence the powers of propagation, and effect a durable developement of germ and pro|pen&s;ities; that is to &s;ay, the air and the &s;un may be the origin of a di&s;tinct race. The variations which food may produce, mu&s;t &s;oon di&s;appear on tran&s;plantation. That which affects the propaga|ting powers, mu&s;t not act upon the &s;upport of life, but upon its original &s;ource, its fir&s;t principle, ani|mal conformation, and motion.</P>
<P>A man tran&s;planted to the frigid zone mu&s;t de|crea&s;e in &s;tature, &s;ince, if the power or momentum of the heart continues the &s;ame, the circulation tion mu&s;t be performed in a &s;horter time, the pul&s;e become more rapid, and the heat of the blood in|crea&s;ed. Thus Crantz found the Greenlanders not only inferior in &s;tature to the Europeans, but al&s;o that they had a remarkably greater heat of body. The very di&s;proportion between the length of the body and the &s;hortne&s;s of the legs, in the northern people, is &s;uitable to their climate; &s;ince the ex|tremes of the body, by their di&s;tance from the heart, are more &s;ubject to the attacks of cold.</P>
<P>The prominent parts of the countenance, which can le&s;s be guarded from cold, by the care of na|ture for their pre&s;ervation, have a propen&s;ity to become more &s;lat. The ri&s;ing cheek-bone, the half-clo&s;ed, blinking eyes, appear to be intended for the

Thus gradually are produced the beardle&s;s chin, the flatted no&s;e, thin lips, blink|ing eyes, flat countenances, red-brown complexion, black hair, and, in a word, the face of the Cal|muc. Such properties, by continued propagation, at length form a di&s;tant race, which continues to remain di&s;tinct, even when tran&s;planted into warm|er climates.</P>
<P>The red-brown or copper colour appears to be as natural an effect of the acidity of the air in cold climates, as the olive-brown of the alcaline and bi|lious quality of the juices in warm; without taking the native di&s;po&s;ition of the American into the e&s;timate, who appears to have lo&s;t half the powers of life which may be regarded as the effect of cold.</P>
<P>The growth of the porous parts of the body mu&s;t increa&s;e in the hot and moi&s;t climates. Hence the thick &s;hort no&s;e and projecting lips. The &s;kin mu&s;t be oiled, not only to prevent exce&s;&s;ive per|&s;piration, but al&s;o the imbibing the putre&s;cent par|ticles of the moi&s;t air.

<P>The trunk, or &s;tem of the root may degenerate; but this having once taken root, and &s;tifled other germs, re&s;i&s;ts any future change of form, the cha|racter of the race having once gained a preponde|rance in the propagating powers.</P>

<HEAD>From Winkelmann's Hi&s;tory of Art.</HEAD>
<P>OUR eyes convince us, with re&s;pect to the form of man, that the character of nation, as well as of mind, is vi&s;ible in the countenance. As na|ture has &s;eparated large di&s;tricts by mountains and waters, &s;o likewi&s;e has &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed the inha|bitants by peculiarity of features. In countries far di&s;tant from each other, the difference is like|wi&s;e vi&s;ible in other parts of the body, and in &s;tature. Animals are not mere varied, according to the properties of the countries they inhabit, than men are; and &s;ome have pretended to remark, that animals even partake o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the propen&s;ities of the men.</P>
<P>The formation of the countenance is as various as languages, nay, indeed, as dialects, which are thus or thus various in con&s;equence of the organs of &s;peech. In cold countries, the fibres of the tongue
<PB N="99" REF="027203_0107_0FD3D31531B72C40">
mu&s;t be le&s;s flexible and rapid than in warm. The natives of Greenland, and certain tribes of Ame|rica, are ob&s;erved to want &s;ome letters of the al|phabet, which mu&s;t originate in the &s;ame cau&s;e. Hence it happens, that the northern languages have more mono&s;yllables, and are more clogged with con&s;onants, the connecting and pronouncing of which is difficult, and &s;ometimes impo&s;&s;ible, to other nations.</P>
<P>A celebrated writer has endeavoured to account for the varieties of the Italian dialects, from the formation of the organs of &s;peech. "For this rea&s;on (&s;ays he) the people of Lombardy, inhabit|ing a cold country, have a more rough and con|ci&s;e pronunciation. The inhabitants of Florence and Rome &s;peak in a more mea&s;ured tone; and the Neapolitans, under &s;till warmer &s;ky, pronounce the vowels more open, and &s;peak with more ful|ne&s;s."</P>
<P>Per&s;ons well acquainted with various nations, can di&s;tingui&s;h them as ju&s;tly from the form of their countenance, as from their &s;peech. Therefore, &s;ince man has ever been the object of art and arti&s;ts, the latter have con&s;tantly given the forms of face of their rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ctive nations; and that art, among the ancients, gave the form and countenance of man, is proved by the &s;ame effect having taken place among the moderns. German, Dutch, or French, when the arti&s;ts neither travel nor &s;tudy foreign forms, can be known by their pictures as perfectly as Chine&s;e or Tartars. After re&s;iding many years in Italy, Rubens continued to draw his figures as if he had never l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t his native land.</P>

of growth, a &s;welling, occa&s;ioned by the heat of the climate; like as our lips are &s;welled by heat or &s;harp &s;aline moi&s;ture, and al&s;o, in &s;ome men, by violent pa&s;&s;ion. The &s;mall eyes of the di&s;tant northern and ea&s;tern nations are in con&s;equence of the imperfection of their growth. They are &s;hort and &s;lender. Nature produces &s;uch forms the more &s;he approaches extremes, where &s;he has to encounter heat or cold. In the one &s;he is prompter and exhau&s;ted, and in the other crude, never arriving at maturity. The flower withers in exce&s;&s;ive heat, and, deprived of &s;un, is deprived of colour. All plants degenerate in dark and con|fined places.</P>
<P>Nature forms with greater regularity the more &s;he approaches her center, and in more moderate climates. Hence the Grecian and our own idea of beauty, being derived from more perfect &s;ymme|try, mu&s;t be more accurate than the idea of tho&s;e, in whom to u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion of a modern poet, the image of the Creator is half defaced.</P>

<P>The Americans are mo&s;t remarkable, becau&s;e that many of them have no eyebrows, and none have beards; yet we mu&s;t not infer that they are enfeebled in the organs of generation, &s;ince the Tartars and Chine&s;e have almo&s;t the &s;ame charac|teri&s;tics. They are far, however, from being very fruitful, or much addicted to love. True it is, the Chine&s;e and Tartars are not ab&s;olutely beardle&s;s. When they are about thirty, a &s;mall penciled kind of whi&s;ker grows on the upper lip, and &s;ome &s;cat|tered hairs at the end of the chin.</P>
<P>Exclu&s;ive of the E&s;quimaux, who differ in gait, fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">m, features, and manners, from other &s;avages of North-America, we may likewi&s;e call the Akan|&s;ans
<PB N="101" REF="027203_0109_0FD3CB1966BB67C0">
a variety, whom the French have generally named the hand&s;ome men. They are tall and &s;traight, have good features, without the lea&s;t ap|pearance of beard, have regular eyelids, blue eyes, and fine fair hair; while the neighbouring people are low of &s;tature, have abject countenances, black eyes, the hair of the head black as ebony, and of the body thick and rough.</P>
<P>Though the Peruvians are not very tall, and ge|nerally thick &s;et, yet they are tolerably well made. There are many, it is true, who, by being diminu|tive, are mon&s;trous. Some are deaf, dumb, blind, and idiots; and others want a limb when born. In all probability, the exce&s;&s;ive labour to which they have been &s;ubjected by the barbarity of the Spani|ards, has produced &s;uch numbers of defective men. Tyranny has an influence on the very phy&s;ical temperament of &s;laves. Their no&s;e is aquiline, their forehead narrow, their hair black, &s;trong, &s;mooth, and plentiful; their complexion an olive red, the apple of the eye black, and the white not very clear. They never have any beard, for we cannot be&s;tow that name on &s;ome &s;hort &s;traggling hairs which &s;prout in old age; nor have either men or women the downy hair which generally appears after the age of puberty. In this they are di&s;tingui&s;hed from all people on earth, even from the Tartars and Chine&s;e. As in eunuchs, it is the character of their degeneracy.</P>
<P>Judging by the rage which the Americans have to mutilate and disfigure them&s;elves, we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e they were all di&s;contented with the propor|tions of their limbs and bodies. Not a &s;ingle nati|on has been di&s;covered in this fourth quarter of the globe, which has not adopted the cu&s;tom of artifici|ally changing, either the form of the lips, the hol|low of the ear, or the &s;hape of the head, by forcing it to a&s;&s;ume an extraordinary and ridiculous figure.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="027203_0110_0FD3D376975F4E90">
There are &s;avages who&s;e heads are pyramidal, or conical, with the top terminating in a point. Others have flat heads, with large foreheads, and the back part flattened. This caprice &s;eems to have been the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable, at lea&s;t it was the mo&s;t common. Some Canadians had their heads perfectly &s;pherical. Though the natural form of the head really approaches the circular, the&s;e &s;a|vages, who, by being thus di&s;torted, acquired the appellation of bowl or bullet-head, do not appear le&s;s di&s;gu&s;ting, for having made the head too round, and perverted the original purpo&s;e of na|ture, to which nothing can be added, from which nothing can be taken away, without &s;ome e&s;&s;ential error being the re&s;ult, which is de&s;tructive to the animal.</P>
<P>In fine, we have &s;een, on the banks of the Ma|ragnon, Americans with &s;quare or cubical heads; that is to &s;ay, flattened on the face, the top, the temples, and the occiput, which appears to be the la&s;t &s;tage of human extravagance.</P>
<P>It is not ea&s;y to conceive how it was po&s;&s;ible to compre&s;s and mould the bones of the &s;cull into &s;o many various forms, without mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially in|juring the &s;eat of &s;en&s;e, and the organs of rea&s;on, or occa&s;ioning either madne&s;s or idioti&s;m, &s;ince we &s;o often have examples, that violent contu&s;ions in the region of the temples have occa&s;ioned lunacy, and deprived the &s;ufferers of intellectual capacity. For it is not true, as ancient narratives have af|firmed, that all Indians with flat or &s;ugar-loaf heads were really idiots. Had this been the ca&s;e, there mu&s;t have been whole nations in America either fooli&s;h or frantic, which is impo&s;&s;ible even in &s;uppo&s;ition.</P>

<P>It would be very difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to give you my particular rules for delineating various nations and ages with mathematical certainty, e&s;pecially if I would add all that I have had occa&s;i|on to remark concerning the beauty of the an|tiques.

which I have a large collection, and by a long &s;tu|dy of the antiques.</P>
<P>To draw any head accurately in profile, takes me much time. I have di&s;&s;ected the &s;culls of peo|ple lately dead, that I might be able to define the lines of the countenance, and the angle of the&s;e lines with the horizon. I was thus led to the di&s;|covery of the maximum and minimum of this angle. I began with the monkey, proceeded to the Negro and the European, till I a&s;cended to the countenances of antiquity, and examined a Me|du&s;a, an Apollo, or a Venus de Medicis. This concerns only the profile. There is another diffe|rence, in the breadth of the cheeks, which I have found to be large&s;t among the Calmucs, and much &s;maller among the A&s;iatic Negroes. The Chine&s;e, and inhabitants of the Molucca and other A&s;iatic i&s;lands, appear to me to have broad cheeks, with projecting jaw-bones; the under jaw-bone, in par|ticular, very high, and almo&s;t forming a right angle, which, among Europeans, is very obtu&s;e, and &s;till more &s;o among the African Negroes.</P>
<P>I have not hitherto been able to procure a real &s;cull of an American, and therefore can &s;ay nothing on that &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I am almo&s;t a&s;hamed to confe&s;s that I have not yet been able accurately to draw the countenance of a Jew, although they are &s;o very remarkable in their features; nor have I yet obtained preci&s;ion in delineating the Italian face. It is generally true, that the upper and under jaw of the European is le&s;s broad than the breadth of the &s;cull, and that among the A&s;iatics they are much broader; but I have not been able to determine the &s;pecific diffe|rences between European nations.</P>
<P>I have very frequently, by phy&s;iognomonical &s;en|&s;ations, been able to di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;oldiers of dif|ferent nations; the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, the Iri&s;hman, and the native of England; yet have I never been able

<P>People who do not bear our badges of &s;ervitude, are not &s;o mi&s;erable as we &s;u&s;pect. Their &s;pecies of &s;lavery is very &s;upportable in their mode of exi&s;tence. They are incomparably better fed than German pea&s;ants, and have neither to contend with the cares of providing, nor the exce&s;&s;es of la|bour. As their race of hor&s;es exceeds ours in &s;trength and &s;ize, &s;o do their people tho&s;e among us who have, or &s;uppo&s;e they have, property. Their wants are few, and their under&s;tanding &s;uf|ficient to &s;upply the wants they have. The Ru&s;&s;i|an or Poli&s;h pea&s;ant is, of nece&s;&s;ity, carpenter, tailor, &s;hoemaker, ma&s;on, thatcher, &amp;c. and, when
<PB N="106" REF="027203_0114_0FD3D377F83F79A0">
when we examine their performances, we may ea&s;ily judge of their capacities. Hence their apti|tude at mechanical and handicraft profe&s;&s;ions, as &s;oon as they are taught their principles. Inventi|on of what is great they have no preten&s;ions to; their mind, like a machine, is at re&s;t, when the nece&s;&s;ity that &s;et it in motion cea&s;es.</P>
<P>Of the numerous nations &s;ubject to the Ru&s;&s;ian &s;ceptre, I &s;hall omit tho&s;e of the exten&s;ive Siberian di&s;tricts, and confine my&s;elf to the Ru&s;&s;ians, pro|perly &s;o called, who&s;e countries are bounded by Finland, Ea&s;tland, Livonia, and the borders of A&s;ia. The&s;e are di&s;tingui&s;hable by prodigious &s;trength, firm &s;inews, broad brea&s;t, and colo&s;&s;al neck, which, in a whole &s;hip's crew, will be the &s;ame, re&s;embling the Farne&s;ian Hercules; by their black, broad, thick, rough, &s;trong hair, head and beard; their &s;unken eyes, black as pitch; their &s;hort forehead, compre&s;&s;ed to the no&s;e, with an arch. We often find thin lips, though in general they are pouting, wide, and thick. The women have high cheek-bones, hollow temples, &s;nub no&s;es, and retreating arched foreheads, with very few traits of ideal beauty. At a certain period of life both &s;exes frequently become corpulent. Their power of propagation almo&s;t exceeds belief.</P>
<P>In the centre dwell the Ukranians, of whom mo&s;t of the regiments of Co&s;&s;acs are formed. They are di&s;tingui&s;hed among the Ru&s;&s;ians almo&s;t as the Jews are among Europeans. They generally have aquiline no&s;es; are nobly formed; amorous, yielding, crafty, and without &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions; pro|bably becau&s;e, for &s;ome thou&s;ands of years, they have followed agriculture, have lived in &s;ociety, had a form of government, and inhabit a mo&s;t fruitful country, in a moderate climate, re&s;embling that of France. Among all the&s;e people, the great|e&s;t activity and &s;trength of body are united. They are as different from the German boor, as quick&s;il|ver

is from lead; and how our ance&s;tors could &s;up|po&s;e them to be &s;tupid, is inconceivable.</P>
<P>Thus too the Turks re&s;emble the Ru&s;&s;ians. They are a mixture of the noble&s;t blood of A&s;ia Minor with the more material and gro&s;s Tartar. The Natolian, of a &s;piritual nature, feeds on me|ditation; will for days contemplate a &s;ingle object, &s;eat him&s;elf at the che&s;s-board, or wrap him&s;elf up in the mantle of taciturnity. The eye, void of pa&s;|&s;ion or great enterpri&s;e, abounds in all the pene|tration of benevolent cunning; the mouth elo|quent; the hair of the head and beard, and the &s;mall neck, declare the flexibility of the man.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;hman is erect in his gait, and generally &s;tands as if a &s;take were driven through his body. His nerves are &s;trong, and he is the be&s;t runner. He is di&s;tingui&s;hed from all other men by the roundne&s;s and &s;moothne&s;s of the mu&s;cles of his face. If he neither &s;peak nor move, he &s;eldom declares the capability and mind he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in &s;o &s;uperior a degree. His &s;ilent eye &s;eeks not to plea&s;e. His hair, coat, and character, are alike &s;mooth. Not cunning, but on his guard; and, perhaps, but lit|tle colouring is nece&s;&s;ary to deceive him on any oc|ca&s;ion. Like the bull-dog, he does not bark; but, if irritated, rages. As he wi&s;hes not for more e&s;|teem than he merits, &s;o he dete&s;ts the fal&s;e preten|&s;ions of his neighbours, who would arrogate excel|lence they do not po&s;&s;e&s;s. De&s;irous of private hap|pine&s;s, he di&s;regards public opinion, and obtains a character of &s;ingularity. His imagination, like a &s;ea-coal fire, is not the &s;plendour that enlightens a region, but expands genial warmth. Per&s;everance in &s;tudy, and pertinacity, for centuries, in fixed principles, have rai&s;ed and maintained the Briti&s;h &s;pirit as well as the Briti&s;h government, trade, ma|nufactures, and marine. He has punctuality and probity, not trifling away his time to e&s;tabli&s;h fal&s;e

principles, or making a parade with a vicious hypo|the&s;is.</P>
<P>In the temperament of nations, the French cla&s;s is that of the &s;anguine. Frivolous, benevolent, and o&s;tentatious, the Frenchman forgets not his inoffen&s;ive parade till old age has made him wi&s;e. At all times di&s;po&s;ed to enjoy life, he is the be&s;t of companions. He pardons him&s;elf much; and therefore pardons others, if they will but grant that they are foreigners, and he is a Frenchman. His gait is dancing, his &s;peech without accent, and his ear incurable. His imagination pur&s;ues the con|&s;equences of &s;mall things with the rapidity of the &s;econd-hand of a &s;top-watch, but &s;eldom gives tho&s;e loud, &s;trong, reverberating &s;trokes which proclaim new di&s;coveries to the world. Wit is his inheritance. His countenance is open, and, at fir&s;t &s;ight, &s;peaks a thou&s;and plea&s;ant, amiable things. Silent he cannot be, either with eye, tongue or feature. His eloquence is often deafen|ing; but his good humour ca&s;ts a veil over all his failings. His form is equally di&s;tinct from that of other nations, and difficult to de&s;cribe in words. No other man has &s;o little of the firm or deep traits, or &s;o much motion. He is all appearance, all ge&s;ture; therefore the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion &s;eldom deceives, but declares who and what he is. His imagination is incapable of high flights, and the &s;ublime in all arts is to him offence. Hence his di&s;like of whatever is antique in art or literature, his deafne&s;s to true mu&s;ic, his blindne&s;s to the higher beauties of painting. His la&s;t, mo&s;t mark|ing trait is, that he is a&s;toni&s;hed at every thing, and cannot comprehend how it is po&s;&s;ible men &s;hould be other than they are at Paris.</P>
<P>The countenance of the Italian is &s;oul, his &s;peech exclamation, his motion ge&s;ticulation. His form is the noble&s;t, and his country the true <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eat of beauty. His &s;hort forehead, his &s;trong, marked
<PB N="109" REF="027203_0117_0FD3D2DDF4508078">
eyebones, the fine contour of his mouth, give a kindred claim to the antiquities of Greece. The ardour of his eyes denotes, that the beneficent &s;un brings forth fruit more perfect in Italy than be|yond the Alps. His imagination is ever in motion, ever &s;ympathi&s;ing with &s;urrounding objects, and, as in the poem of Ario&s;to the whole works of crea|tion are reflected, &s;o are they generally in the nati|onal &s;pirit. That power which could bring forth &s;uch a work, appears to me the general repre&s;en|tative of genius. It &s;ings all, and from it all things are &s;ung. The &s;ublime in arts is the birthright of the Italian. Modern religion and politics may have degraded and fal&s;ified his character, may have rendered the vulgar faithle&s;s and crafty, but the &s;uperior part of the nation abounds in the noble&s;t and be&s;t of men.</P>
<P>The Dutchman is tranquil, patient, confined, and appears to will nothing. His walk and eye are long &s;ilent, and an hour of his company will &s;carce|ly produce a thought. He is little troubled by the tide of pa&s;&s;ions, and he will contemplate unmoved the parading &s;treamers of all nations &s;ailing before his eyes. Quiet and competence are his gods; therefore tho&s;e arts alone which can procure the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, employ his faculties. His laws, political and commercial, have originated in that &s;pirit of &s;ecurity which maintains him in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what he has gained. He is tolerant in all that re|lates to opinion, if he be but left peaceably to enjoy his property, and to a&s;&s;emble at the meeting-hou&s;e of his &s;ect. The character of the ant is &s;o applica|ble to the Dutch, that to this literature it&s;elf con|forms in Holland. All poetical powers, exerted in great works or &s;mall, or foreign to this nation. They endure plea&s;ure from the peru&s;al of, but pro|duce no poetry. I &s;peak of the United Provinces, and not of the Flemings, who&s;e jovial character is
<PB N="110" REF="027203_0118_0FD3D31FB97BF528">
in the midway between the Italian and French. A high forehead, half-open eyes, full no&s;e, hanging cheeks, wide open mouth, fle&s;hy lips, broad chin, and large ears, I believe to be characteri&s;tic of the Dutchman.</P>
<P>A German thinks it di&s;graceful not to know every thing, and dreads nothing &s;o much as to be thought a fool. Probity often makes him appear a blockhead. Of nothing is he &s;o proud as of hone&s;t, moral under&s;tanding. According to modern tac|tics, he is certainly the be&s;t &s;oldier, and the teacher of all Europe. He is allowed to be the greate&s;t in|ventor, and often with &s;o little o&s;tentation, that foreigners have, for centuries, unknown to him, robbed him of his glory. From the age of Taci|tus, a willing dependant, he has exerted faculties for the &s;ervice of his ma&s;ters, which others only exert for freedom and property. His countenance does not, like a painting in fre&s;co, &s;peak at a di&s;tance; but he mu&s;t be &s;ought and &s;tudied. His good na|ture and benevolence are often concealed under ap|parent moro&s;ene&s;s, and a third per&s;on is always ne|ce&s;&s;ary to draw off the veil, and &s;how him as he is. He is difficult to move, and, without the aid of old wine, is &s;ilent. He does not &s;u&s;pect his own worth, and wonders when it is di&s;covered by others. Fi|delity, indu&s;try, and &s;ecrecy, are his principal cha|racteri&s;tics. Not having wit, he indulges his &s;en&s;i|bility. Moral good is the colouring which he re|quires in all arts. His epic and lyric &s;pirit walk in unfrequented paths. Hence his great, and fre|quently gigantic &s;en&s;e, which &s;eldom permits him the clear a&s;pect of enthu&s;ia&s;m, or the glow of &s;plen|dour. Moderate in the u&s;e of this world's delights, he has little propen&s;ity to &s;en&s;uality and extrava|gance; but he is therefore formal, and le&s;s &s;ocial than his neighbour.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Re&s;emblance between Parents and Children.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE re&s;emblance between parents and children is very commonly remarkable. Family phy|&s;iognomy is as undeniable as national. To doubt this, is to doubt what is &s;elf-evident; to wi&s;h to interpret it, is to wi&s;h to explore the inexplicable &s;ecret of exi&s;tence. Striking and frequent as the re&s;emblance between parents and children is, yet have the relations between the characters and coun|tenances of families never been inquired into. No one has, to my knowledge, made any regular ob|&s;ervations on this &s;ubject. I mu&s;t al&s;o confe&s;s, that I have my&s;elf made but few with that circum&s;tan|tial attention which is nece&s;&s;ary. All I have to remark is as follows:</P>
<P>When the father is con&s;iderably &s;tupid, and the mother exceedingly the rever&s;e, then will mo&s;t of the children be endued with extraordinary under|&s;tanding.</P>
<P>When the father is good, truly good, the chil|dren
<PB N="114" REF="027203_0123_0FD3D300F9529F20">
will in general be well-di&s;po&s;ed; at lea&s;t mo&s;t of them will be benevolent.</P>
<P>The &s;on generally appears to inherit moral good|ne&s;s from the good father, and intelligence from the intelligent mother; the daughter partakes of the character of the mother.</P>
<P>If we wi&s;h to find the mo&s;t certain marks of re|&s;emblance between parents and children, they &s;hould be ob&s;erved within an hour or two after birth. We may then perceive whom the child mo&s;t re&s;embles in its formation. The mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential re&s;emblance is u&s;ually afterwards lo&s;t, and does not perhaps appear for many years; or not till after death.</P>
<P>When children, as they increa&s;e in years, vi&s;ibly increa&s;e in the re&s;emblance of form and features to their parents, we cannot doubt but there is an in|crea&s;ing re&s;emblance of character. How much &s;o|ever the characters of children may appear unlike that of the parents they re&s;emble, yet will this di&s;|&s;imilarity be found to originate in external circum|&s;tances; and the variety of the&s;e mu&s;t be great in|deed, if the difference of character is not at length overpowered by the re&s;emblance of form.</P>
<P>I believe, that from the &s;trongly delineated fa|ther, the firmne&s;s and the kind (I do not &s;ay the form, but the kind) of bones and mu&s;cles are deri|ved; and from the &s;trongly delineated mother, the kind of nerves and form of the countenance; if the imagination and love of the mother have not fixed them&s;elves too deeply in the countenance of the man.</P>
<P>Certain forms of countenance, in children, ap|pear for a time undecided whether they &s;hall take the re&s;emblance of the father or of the mother; in which ca&s;e I will grant, that external circum&s;tances, preponderating love for the father or mother, or a greater degree of intercour&s;e with either, may in|fluence the form.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="027203_0124_0FD3D33092E9A8D8">
We &s;ometimes &s;ee children who long retain a re|markable re&s;emblance to the father, but at length change, and become more like the mother. I un|dertake not to expound the lea&s;t of the difficulties that occur on this &s;ubject; but the mo&s;t mode&s;t philo&s;ophy may be permitted to compare uncom|mon ca&s;es with tho&s;e which are known, even though they were inexplicable; and this, I believe, is all that philo&s;ophy can and ought to do.</P>
<P>We know that all longings, or moth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> marks, and whatever may be con&s;idered as of the &s;ame na|ture, which is much, do not proceed from the fa|ther, but from the imagination of the mother. We al&s;o know that children mo&s;t re&s;emble the father only when the mother has a very lively imaginati|on, and love for, or fear of the hu&s;band. There|fore, as has been before ob&s;erved, it appears that the matter and <HI>quantum</HI> of the power and of the life, proceed from the father; and from the ima|gination of the mother, &s;en&s;ibility, the kind of nerves, the form, and the appearance.</P>
<P>There are certain forms and features of counte|nance which are long propagated, and others which as &s;uddenly di&s;appear. The beautiful and the de|formed (I do not &s;ay forms of countenances, but what is generally &s;uppo&s;ed to be beauty and de|formity) are not the mo&s;t ea&s;ily propagated; nei|ther are the middling and in&s;ignificant; but the great and the minute are ea&s;ily inherited, and of long duration.</P>
<P>Parents with &s;mall no&s;es may have children with the large&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t defined; but the father or mother &s;eldom, on the contrary, have a very &s;trong, that is to &s;ay, large-boned no&s;e, which is not com|municated at lea&s;t to one of their children, and which does not remain in the family, e&s;pecially when it is in the female line. It may &s;eem to have been lo&s;t for many years, but &s;oon or late will again make its appearance, and its re&s;emblance to the
<PB N="116" REF="027203_0125_0FD3D2EF4A9F19D8">
original will be particularly vi&s;ible a day or two after death.</P>
<P>Where any extraordinary vivacity appears in the eyes of the mother, there is almo&s;t a certainty that the&s;e eyes will become hereditary; for the imagination of the mother is delighted with no|thing &s;o much as with the beauty of her own eyes. Phy&s;iognomonical &s;en&s;ation has been hitherto more generally directed to the eyes, than to the no&s;e and form of the face; but if women &s;hould once be induced to examine the no&s;e, and form of the face, as a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly as they have done their eyes, it is to be expected that the former will be no le&s;s &s;trikingly hereditary than the latter.</P>
<P>Well-arched and &s;hort foreheads are ea&s;y of in|heritance, but not of long duration; and here the proverb is applicable, <HI>Quod cito fit, cito perit.</HI> (Soon got, &s;oon gone.)</P>
<P>It is equally certain and inexplicable, that &s;ome remarkable phy&s;iognomies, of the mo&s;t fruitful per&s;ons, have been wholly lo&s;t to their po&s;terity; and it is as certain and inexplicable, that others are never lo&s;t. Nor is it le&s;s remarkable, that cer|tain &s;trong countenances, of the father or mother, di&s;appear in the children, and perfectly revive in the grand-children.</P>
<P>As a proof of the powers of the imagination of the mother, we &s;ometimes &s;ee, that a woman &s;hall have children by the &s;econd hu&s;band, which &s;hall re&s;emble the fir&s;t, at lea&s;t in the general appear|ance. The Italians, however, are manife&s;tly too extravagant, when they &s;uppo&s;e children, who &s;trongly re&s;emble their father, are ba&s;e bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n. They &s;ay that the mother, during the commi&s;&s;ion of a crime &s;o &s;hameful, wholly employs her imagi|nation concerning the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;urpri&s;e by, and the image of, her hu&s;band. But, were this fear &s;o to act, the form of the children mu&s;t not only have the very image of the hu&s;band, but al&s;o
<PB N="117" REF="027203_0126_0FD3D2ECCBE17160">
his appearance of rage and revenge, without which the adulterous wife could not imagine the being &s;urpri&s;ed by, or image of, her hu&s;band. It is this appearance, this rage, that &s;he fears, and not the man.</P>
<P>Natural children generally re&s;emble one of their parents more than the legitimate.</P>
<P>The more there is of individual love, of pure, faithful, mild affection, the more this love is reci|procal and uncon&s;trained between the father and mother, which reciprocal love and affection imply a certain degree of imagination, and the capacity of receiving impre&s;&s;ions, the more will the counte|nances of the children appear to be compo&s;ed of the features of the parents.</P>
<P>The &s;anguine of all the temperaments is the mo&s;t ea&s;ily inherited, and with it volatility; and, being once introduced, much indu&s;try and &s;uffering will be nece&s;&s;ary to extirminate this volatility.</P>
<P>The natural timidity of the mother may ea&s;ily communicate the melancholy temperament of the father.

Thus we find tho&s;e mothers, who, du|ring the whole time of their pregnancy, are mo&s;t in dread of producing mon&s;trous or marked children, becau&s;e they remember to have &s;een objects that excited abhorrence, generally have the be&s;t form|ed, and free&s;t from marks; for the fear, though real, was the fear of rea&s;on, and not the &s;udden effect of an object exciting abhorrence ri&s;ing in|&s;tantaneou&s;ly to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight.</P>
<P>When both parents have given a deep root to the choleric temperament in a family, it may pro|bably be &s;ome centuries before it be again modera|ted. Phlegm is not &s;o ea&s;ily inherited, even though both father and mother &s;hould be phlegmatic; for
<PB N="118" REF="027203_0127_0FD3D331BB3B96E8">
there are certain moments of life when the phlegm|atic acts with its whole power, though it acts thus but rarely, and the&s;e moments may and mu&s;t have their effects; but nothing appears more ea&s;y of inheritance than activity and indu&s;try, when the&s;e have their origin in organization, and the nece&s;&s;ity of producing alteration. It will be long before an indu&s;trious couple, to whom not only a livelihood, but bu&s;ine&s;s, is in it&s;elf nece&s;&s;ary, &s;hall not have a &s;ingle de&s;cendant with the like qualities, as &s;uch mothers are generally prolific.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Remarks on the Opinions of Buffon, Haller, and Bonnet, concerning the re&s;emblance between Parents and Children.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<DIV3 TYPE="quotation">
<P>THE theory or hypothe&s;is of Buffon, concern|ing the cau&s;e of the human form, is well known, which Haller has abridged and more clearly explained in the following manner:</P>
<P>"Both &s;exes have their &s;emen, in which are active particles of a certain form. From the union of the&s;e the fruit of the womb ari&s;es. The&s;e parti|cles contain the re&s;emblance of all the parts of the father or mother. They are, by nature, &s;epa|rated from the rude and unformed particles of the human juices, and are impre&s;&s;ed with the form of all the parts of the body of the father or mother. Hence ari&s;es the re&s;emblance of children to their parents. This will account for the mixture of the features of father and mother in the children&mdash;for &s;pots in animals, when the male and female are of different colours&mdash;for the Mulatto produced by
<PB N="119" REF="027203_0128_0FD3D2F153C58DD0">
a Negro and a White&mdash;and for many other pheno|mena difficult to be re&s;olved.</P>
<P>"It may be a&s;ked, how the&s;e particles can a&s;&s;ume the internal &s;tructure of the body of the father, &s;ince they can properly be only the images of the hollow ve&s;&s;els? To which it is an&s;wered, that we know not all the powers of Nature, and that &s;he may have pre&s;erved to her&s;elf, though &s;he has con|cealed it from her &s;cholar, Man, the art of making internally models and impre&s;&s;ions, which &s;hall ex|pre&s;s the whole &s;olidity of the model."</P>
<P>Haller, in his preface to Buffon's Natural Hi&s;to|ry, has, in my opinion, indi&s;putably confuted this &s;y&s;tem. But he has not only forborne to elucidate the re&s;emblance between fathers and children, but while oppo&s;ing Buffon, he has &s;poken &s;o much on the natural, phy&s;iological di&s;&s;imilarity of the human body, that he appears to have denied this re&s;emblance. Buffon's hypothe&s;is offended all phi|lo&s;ophy; and though we cannot entirely approve the theory of Bonnet, yet he has very effectually oppo&s;ed the incongruities of Buffon, to which Buf|fon him&s;elf could &s;carcely give any &s;erious faith. But he, as we &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee, has either avoided the que&s;tion of re&s;emblance between parents and chil|dren, or, in order to &s;trengthen his own &s;y&s;tem, has rather &s;ought to palliate than to an&s;wer difficulties.</P>

<HEAD>On the Re&s;emblance between Children and their Parents.</HEAD>
<P>"I mu&s;t own, that, by the foregoing hypothe|&s;is, I have not been &s;ucce&s;sful in explaining the re&s;emblance of features found between parents and children. But are not the&s;e features very ambigu|ous? Do we not &s;uppo&s;e that to be the cau&s;e, which probably is not &s;o? The father is deformed, the &s;on is deformed after the &s;ame manner, and it is therefore concluded that deformity is inherited. This may be true; but it may be fal&s;e. The de|formity of each may ari&s;e from very different cau|&s;es, and the&s;e cau&s;es may be infinitely varied.</P>
<P>"It is le&s;s difficult to explain hereditary di&s;|ea&s;es. We can ea&s;ily conceive, that defective jui|ces may produce defective germs; and when the &s;ame parts of the body are affected by di&s;ea&s;e in father or mother, and in child, this ari&s;es from the &s;imilar conformation of the parts, by which they are &s;ubject to like inconveniencies. Be&s;ides, the mi&s;hapen body often originates in di&s;ea&s;e being hereditary, which much dimini&s;hes the fir&s;t diffi|culty. For, &s;ince the juices conducted to tho&s;e parts are of a bad quality, the parts mu&s;t be more or le&s;s ill formed, according as they are more or le&s;s capable of being affected by the&s;e juices."</P>

di&s;ea&s;e. Shall the defective juices of father or mother very much alter the germ, and produce, in the very parts where the father or mother is inju|red, important changes of bad formation, more or le&s;s, according to the capability of the germ, and its power of re&s;i&s;tance? And &s;hall the healthy juices of the parent in no manner affect the germ? Why &s;hould not the healthy juices be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> active as the unhealthy? Why &s;hould they not introduce the &s;ame qualities in miniature, which the father and mother have in the gro&s;s, &s;ince the father and mother a&s;&s;imilate the nutriment they receive to their own nature, and &s;ince the &s;eminal juices are the &s;piritual extract of all their juices and powers, as we have ju&s;t rea&s;on to conclude from the mo&s;t continued and accurate ob&s;ervations? Why &s;hould they not as naturally, and as powerfully, act upon the germ, to produce all po&s;&s;ible re&s;emblance? But which re&s;emblance is infinitely varied, by diffe|rently changeable and changed circum&s;tances; &s;o that the germ continually pre&s;erves &s;ufficient of its own original nature and properties, yet is always very di&s;tinct from the parents, and &s;ometimes even &s;eems to have derived very little from them, which may happen from a thou&s;and accidental cau&s;es or changes.</P>
<P>Hence family re&s;emblance and di&s;&s;imilarity be|ing &s;ummarily con&s;idered, we &s;hall find that na|ture, wholly employed to propagate, appears to be entirely directed to produce an equilibrium be|tween the individual power of the germ, in its fir&s;t formation, and the re&s;embling power of the pa|rents; that the originality of the fir&s;t form of the germ may not wholly di&s;appear before the too great power of re&s;emblance to the parents, but that they may mutually concur, and both be &s;ubject to num|berle&s;s circum&s;tances, which may increa&s;e or di|mini&s;h their re&s;pective powers, in order that the
<PB N="122" REF="027203_0131_0FD3D2FCA59B5990">
riches of variety, and the utility of the creature, and its dependence on the whole, and the general Creator, may be the greater and more predomi|nant.</P>
<P>From all ob&s;ervations on the re&s;emblance between parents and children which I have been enabled to make, it appears to me evident, that neither the theories of Bonnet nor Buffon give any &s;y&s;tematic explanation of phenomena, the exi&s;tence of which cannot be denied by the &s;ophi&s;try of hypothe&s;is. Dimini&s;h the difficulties as much as we will, facts will &s;till &s;tare us in the face. If the germ exi&s;t pre|formed in the mother, can this germ, at that time, have phy&s;iognomy? Can it, at that time, re&s;emble the future, promi&s;cuous, fir&s;t, or &s;econd father? Is it not perfectly indifferent to either? or, if the phy&s;iognomonical germ exi&s;t in the father, how can it &s;ometimes re&s;emble the mother, &s;ometimes the father, often both, and often neither?</P>
<P>To me it appears, that &s;omething germ-like, or a whole capable of receiving the human form, mu&s;t previou&s;ly exi&s;t in the mother; but which is nothing more than the foundation of the future fatherly or motherly I know not what, and is the efficient cau&s;e of the future living fruit. This germ-like &s;omething, which, mo&s;t e&s;pecially con|&s;tituted agreeable to the human form, is analagous to the nature and temperature of the mother, re|ceives a peculiar individual per&s;onal phy&s;iognomy, according to the propen&s;ities of the father or mo|ther, the di&s;po&s;ition of the moment of conception, and probably of many other future deci&s;ive mo|ments.</P>
<P>Still much remains to the freedom and predi&s;po|&s;ition of man. He may deprave or improve the &s;tate of the juices, he may calm or agitate his mind, may awaken every &s;en&s;ation of love, and by various modes increa&s;e or relax them. Yet I think, that neither the nature of the bones, nor the

<P>Ob&s;ervations on the New-born, the Dying, and the Dead.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I HAVE remarked in &s;ome children, about an hour after a not difficult birth, a &s;triking, though infantine re&s;emblance, in the profile, to the profile of the father. In a few days, this re&s;emblance had nearly di&s;appeared. The impre&s;&s;ion of the open air, nutriment, and perhaps of po&s;ition, had &s;o far altered the outlines, that the child &s;eemed entire|ly different.</P>
<P>Two of the&s;e children I &s;aw dead, the one about &s;ix weeks, and the other about four years old; and nearly twelve hours after death, I ob&s;erved the &s;ame profile which I had before remarked an hour after birth, with this difference, that the profile of the dead child, as is natural, was &s;omething more ten&s;e and fixed than the living. A part of this re&s;emblance, however, on the third day, was re|markably gone.</P>
<P>One man of fifty, and another of &s;eventy years of age, who fell under my ob&s;ervation while they were living, and after death, appeared, while liv|ing,
<PB N="124" REF="027203_0133_0FD3CAF4F4AFE658">
not to have the lea&s;t re&s;emblance to their &s;ons, and who&s;e countenances &s;eemed to be of a quite different cla&s;s: yet, the &s;econd day after death, the profile of one had a &s;triking re&s;em|blance to that of his elde&s;t, and, of the other, to the profile of his third &s;on; as much &s;o as the pro|file of the dead children before mentioned re&s;em|bled the living profile an hour after birth, &s;tronger indeed, and, as a painter would &s;ay, harder. On the third day, here al&s;o a part of the re&s;emblance di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>I have uniformly ob&s;erved among the many dead per&s;ons I have &s;een, that &s;ixteen, eighteen, or twenty-four hours after death, according to the di&s;ea&s;e, they have had a more beautiful form, bet|ter defined, more proportionate, harmonized, ho|mogeneous, more noble, more exalted, than they ever had during life.</P>
<P>May there not be, thought I, in all men, an original phy&s;iognomy, &s;ubject to be di&s;turbed by the ebb and flow of accident and pa&s;&s;ion? and is not this re&s;tored by the calm of death, like as troubled waters, being again left at re&s;t, become clear?</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erved &s;ome among the dying, who had been the rever&s;e of noble or great during life, and who, &s;ome hours before their death, or perhaps &s;ome moments (one was in a delirium), have had an inexpre&s;&s;ible ennobling of the countenance.

<HEAD>CHAPTER XXVI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Influence of Countenance on Countenance.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS the ge&s;tures of our friends and intimates be|come our own, &s;o, in like manner, does their appearance. Whatever we love, we would a&s;&s;imi|late to our&s;elves; and whatever, in the circle of affection, does not change us into it&s;elf, that we change, as far as may be, into our&s;elves.</P>
<P>All things act upon us, and we act upon all things; but nothing has &s;o much influence as what we love; and among all objects of affection, no|thing acts &s;o forcibly as the countenance of man. Its conformity to our countenance makes it mo&s;t worthy our affection. How might it act upon, how attract our attention, had it not &s;ome marks, di&s;coverable or indi&s;coverable, &s;imilar to, at lea&s;t of the &s;ame kind with, the form and features of our own countenance!</P>
<P>Without, however, wi&s;hing farther to penetrate into what is impenetrable, or to define what is in|&s;crutable, the fact is indubitable, that countenances attract countenances, and al&s;o that countenances repel countenances; that &s;imilarity of features between two &s;ympathetic and affectionate men, increa&s;e with the developement and mutual com|munication of their peculiar, individual &s;en&s;ations. The reflexion, if I may &s;o &s;ay, of the per&s;on be|loved, remains upon the countenance of the affec|tionate.</P>
<P>The re&s;emblance frequently exi&s;ts only in a &s;in|gle point&mdash;in the character of mind and counte|nance. A re&s;emblance in the &s;y&s;tem of the bones pre&s;uppo&s;es a re&s;emblance of the nerves and mu&s;cles.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="027203_0135_0FD3D33381BF7AB0">
Di&s;&s;imilar education may affect the latter &s;o much, that the point of attraction may be invi&s;ible to unphy&s;iognomonical eyes. Suffer the two re|&s;embling forms to approach, and they will reci|procally attract and repel each other; remove every intervening ob&s;tacle, and nature will &s;oon prevail. They will recongnize each other, and re|joice in the fle&s;h of their fle&s;h, and the bone of their bone: with ha&s;ty &s;teps will proceed to a&s;&s;imi|late. Such countenances al&s;o, which are very different from each other, may communicate, at|tract, and acquire re&s;emblance; nay, their like|ne&s;s may become more &s;triking than that of the former, if they happen to be more flexible, more capable, and to have greater &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>This re&s;emblance of features, in con&s;equence of mutual affection, is ever the re&s;ult of internal nature and organization, and, therefore, of the character of the per&s;ons. It ever has its founda|tion in a preceding, perhaps, imperceptible re&s;em|blance, which might never have been animated, or &s;u&s;pected, had it not been &s;et in motion by the pre&s;ence of the &s;ympathetic being.</P>
<P>It would be of infinite importance to give the character of tho&s;e countenances which mo&s;t ea&s;ily receive and communicate re&s;emblance. It can|not but be known, that there are countenances that attract all, others that repel all, and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> third kind which are indifferent. The all-repelling ren|der the ignoble countenances over which they have continued influence, more ignoble. The indiffe|rent allows no change. The all-attracting either receive, give, or reciprocally give and receive. The fir&s;t change a little, the &s;econd more, the third mo&s;t. "The&s;e are the &s;ouls (&s;ays Hem&s;ter|huys the younger) which happily, or unhappily, add the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite di&s;cernment to that exce&s;|&s;ive internal ela&s;ticity which occa&s;ions them to wi&s;h and feel immoderately; that is to &s;ay, the

&s;ouls, which are &s;o modified, or &s;ituated, that their attractive force meets the fewe&s;t ob&s;tacles in its progre&s;s."</P>
<P>To &s;tudy the influence of countenance, this in|tercour&s;e of mind would be of the utmo&s;t import|ance. I have found the progre&s;s of re&s;emblance mo&s;t remarkable, when two per&s;ons, the one richly communicative, the other apt to receive, have lived a con&s;iderable time together, without foreign in|tervention; when he who gave had given all, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> he who received could receive no more, phy&s;iogno|monical re&s;emblance had attained its <HI>punctum &s;atu|rationis.</HI> It was incapable of farther increa&s;e.</P>

Being found, he will attract thee to him&s;elf, will give and receive whatever is communicable. The ar|dour of his eyes will nurture thine, and the gen|tlene&s;s of his voice temper thy too-piercing tones. His love will &s;hine in thy countenance, and his image will appear in thee. Thou wilt become what he is, and yet remain what thou art. Affec|tion will make qualities in him vi&s;ible to thee, which never could be &s;een by an unintere&s;ted eye. This capability of remarking, of feeling what there is of divine in him, is a power which will make thy countenance a&s;&s;ume his re&s;emblance.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>On the Influence of the Imagination on the Counte|nance.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>A Word only on a &s;ubject concerning which volumes might be written; for it is a &s;ubject I mu&s;t not leave wholly in &s;ilence. The little, the nothing I have to &s;ay upon it, can only act as an inducement to deeper meditations on a theme &s;o profound.</P>
<P>Imagination acts upon our own countenance, rendering it in &s;ome mea&s;ure re&s;embling the belov|ed or hated image which is living, pre&s;ent, and fleeting before us, and is within the circle of our immediate activity. If a man deeply in love, and &s;uppo&s;ing him&s;elf alone, were ruminating on his beloved mi&s;tre&s;s, to whom his imagination might lend charms, which, if pre&s;ent, he would be unable to di&s;cover: were &s;uch a per&s;on ob&s;erved by a man of penetration, it is probable that traits of the mi&s;tre&s;s might be &s;een in the countenance of this meditating lover. So might, in the cruel features of revenge, the features of the enemy be read, whom imagination repre&s;ents as pre&s;ent. And thus is the countenance a picture of the cha|racteri&s;tic features of all per&s;ons exceedingly loved or hated.</P>
<P>It is po&s;&s;ible, that an eye le&s;s penetrating than that of an angel, may read the image of the Creator in the countenance of a truly pious per&s;on. He who langui&s;hes after Chri&s;t, the more lively, the more di&s;tinctly, the more &s;ublimely, he repre&s;ents to him&s;elf the very pre&s;ence and image of Chri&s;t, the greater re&s;emblance will his own countenance take of this image. The image of imagination often acts more effectually than the real pre&s;ence;
<PB N="129" REF="027203_0138_0FD3D388C3DD5D58">
and whoever has &s;een him of whom we &s;peak, the great <HI>HIM,</HI> though it were but an in&s;tantaneous glimp&s;e, oh! how ince&s;&s;antly will the imagination reproduce his image in the countenance!</P>
<P>Our imagination al&s;o acts upon other countenan|ces. The imagination of the mother acts upon the child; and hence men long have attempted to influence the imagination for the production of beautiful children. In my opinion, however, it is not &s;o much the beauty of &s;urrounding forms, as the intere&s;t taken concerning forms in certain moments: and here again, it is not &s;o much the imagination that acts, as the &s;pirit; that being only the organ of the &s;pirit. Thus it is true, that it is <HI>the &s;pirit that quickeneth the fle&s;h,</HI> and the image of the fle&s;h (merely con&s;idered as &s;uch) <HI>profiteth nothing.</HI></P>
<P>A look of love, from the &s;anctuary of the &s;oul, has certainly greater forming power than hours of deliberate contemplation of the mo&s;t beautiful images. This forming look, if &s;o I may call it, can as little be premeditatedly given, as any other naturally beautiful form can be imparted by a &s;tu|dious contemplation in the looking gla&s;s. All that creates, and is profoundly active, in the inner man, mu&s;t be internal, and be communicated from above; as I believe it &s;uffers it&s;elf not to be occa|&s;ioned, at lea&s;t not by forethought, circum&s;pec|tion, or wi&s;dom in the agent, to produce &s;uch ef|fects. Beautiful forms, or abortions, are neither of them the work of art or &s;tudy, but of interve|ning cau&s;es, of the quick-guiding Providence, the predetermining God.</P>
<P>Endeavour to act upon affection, in&s;tead of the &s;en&s;es.

Creation of every kind is momentaneous; the developement, nutri|ment, change, improving, injuring, is the work of time, art, indu&s;try, and education. Creative power &s;uffers it&s;elf not to be &s;tudied; creation cannot be premeditated. Marks may be moulded; but living e&s;&s;ence, within and without re&s;embling it&s;elf, the image of God, mu&s;t be created, born, <Q>not of the will of the fle&s;h, nor of the will of man, but of God.</Q></P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Effects of the Imagination on the Human Form.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT is equally true and incomprehen&s;ible, that, by the &s;trength of imagination, there are marks communicated by mothers to children during preg|nancy; that there are images, animals, fruit, or other &s;ub&s;tances, on the body of the child; marks of the hand on the very parts where the pregnant per&s;on has been &s;uddenly touched; aver&s;ion to things which have occa&s;ioned di&s;gu&s;t in the mo|ther;
<PB N="131" REF="027203_0140_0FD3D374756E7398">
and a continued &s;curvy communicated to the child, by the unexpected &s;ight of a putrid animal. So many marks on the bodies of children, ari&s;ing not from imaginary but real accidents, mu&s;t oblige us to own, that there is truth in that which is incon|ceivable: therefore the imagination of the mother acts upon the child.</P>
<P>Of the innumerable examples that might be pro|duced, I &s;hall cite the two following:</P>
<P>A woman during the time of her pregnancy, was engaged in a card party, and only wanted the ace of &s;pades to win all that was &s;taked; and as it happened, in the change of cards, the &s;o much wi&s;hed-for ace was given her. Her joy at this &s;ucce&s;s had &s;uch an effect upon her imagination, that the child of which &s;he was pregnant, when born, had the ace of &s;pades depicted in the apple of the eye, and without injury to the organ of &s;ight.</P>
<P>The following anecdote is certainly true, and &s;till more a&s;toni&s;hing:</P>
<P>A lady of Rheinthal had, during her pregnancy, a de&s;ire to &s;ee the execution of a man, who was &s;entenced to have his right hand cut off before he was beheaded. She &s;aw the hand &s;evered from the body, and in&s;tantly turned away and went home, without waiting to &s;ee the death that was to fol|low. This lady bore a daughter who was living at the time this fragment was written, and who had only one hand. The right-hand came away with the after-birth.</P>
<P>Moral marks, as well as phy&s;ical, are perhaps po&s;&s;ible. I have heard of a phy&s;ician, who never failed to &s;teal &s;omething from all the chambers through which he pa&s;&s;ed, which he would after|wards forget; and, in the evening, his wife, who &s;earched his pockets, would find keys, &s;nuff-boxes, etuis-ca&s;es, &s;ci&s;&s;ars, thimbles, &s;pectacles, buckles, &s;poons and other trinkets, which &s;he re&s;tored to
<PB N="132" REF="027203_0141_0FD3D38BE8FBDA10">
the owners. I have been likewi&s;e told of a child, who, at two years of age, was adopted when beg|ging at the door of a noble family, received an ex|cellent education, and became a mo&s;t worthy man, except that he could not forbear to &s;teal. The mothers of the&s;e two extraordinary thieves mu&s;t, during pregnancy, have had an extraordinary de|&s;ire to pilfer. It will be &s;elf-evident, that howe|ver in&s;ufferable &s;uch men are in a &s;tate of &s;ociety, they are rather unfortunate than wicked. Their actions may be as involuntary as mechanical, and, in the &s;ight of God, probably as innocent as the cu&s;tomary motions of our fingers when we tear bits of paper, or do any other indifferent, thought|le&s;s action.</P>
<P>The moral worth of an action mu&s;t be e&s;timated by its intention, as the political worth mu&s;t by its con&s;equences. As little injury as the ace of &s;pades, if the &s;tory be true, did to the countenance of the child, as little probably did this thievi&s;h pro|pen&s;ity to the heart. Such a per&s;on certainly had no rogui&s;h look, no avaricious, downca&s;t, &s;ly, pil|fering a&s;pect, like one who is both &s;oul and body a thief. I have not yet &s;een any man of &s;uch an extraordinary character, and therefore cannot judge of his phy&s;iognomy by experience; yet we have rea&s;on previou&s;ly to conclude, that men &s;o uncom|mon mu&s;t bear &s;ome marks of &s;uch deviation of character in their countenance.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e extraordinary large or &s;mall per&s;ons, by us called giants and dwarfs, &s;hould perhaps be cla&s;&s;ed among the&s;e active and pa&s;&s;ive effects of the imagination. Though giants and dwarfs are not properly born &s;uch, yet it is po&s;&s;ible, however in|comprehen&s;ible, that Nature may fir&s;t, at a certain age, &s;uddenly enlarge or contract her&s;elf.</P>
<P>We have a variety of examples, that the ima|gination appears not only to act upon the pre&s;ent, but on ab&s;ence, di&s;tance, and futurity, Perhaps
<PB N="133" REF="027203_0142_0FD3D385B8715740">
apparitions of the dying and the dead may be at|tributed to this kind of effect. Be it granted that the&s;e facts, which are &s;o numerous, are true, and including not only the apparitions of the dead, but of the living, who have appeared to di&s;tant friends, after collecting &s;uch anecdotes, and adding others on the &s;ubject of pre&s;age and prediction, many phi|lo&s;ophical conjectures will thence ari&s;e, which may probably confirm my following propo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The imagination, incited by the de&s;ire and lan|gui&s;hing of love, or inflamed by pa&s;&s;ion, may act in di&s;tant places and times. The &s;ick or dying per&s;on, for example, &s;ighs after an ab&s;ent friend, who knows not of his &s;ickne&s;s, nor thinks of him at the time. The pining of the imagination pene|trates, as I may &s;ay, walls, and appears in the form of the dying per&s;on, or gives &s;igns of his pre&s;ence, &s;imilar to tho&s;e which his actual pre&s;ence gives. Is there any real corporeal appearance? No. The &s;ick or dying per&s;on is langui&s;hing in his bed, and has never been a moment ab&s;ent; therefore, there is no actual appearance of him who&s;e form has appeared. What then has produced this ap|pearance? What is it that has acted thus at a di&s;|tance on another's &s;en&s;es or imagination?&mdash;Imagi|nation; but the imagination through the focus of pa&s;&s;ion.&mdash;How?&mdash;It is inexplicable. But who can doubt &s;uch facts, who does not mean to laugh at all hi&s;torical facts?</P>
<P>May there not be &s;imilar moments of mind, when the imagination &s;hall act alike inexplicably on the unborn child? That the inexplicable di&s;|gu&s;ts, I will grant; I feel it perfectly. But is it not the &s;ame in the foregoing examples, and in every example of the kind? Like as cripples fir&s;t become &s;o many years a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ter birth, which daily experience proves; may not, after the &s;ame incon|ceivable manner, the &s;eeds of what is gigantic or dwarfi&s;h be the effects of the imagination on the
<PB N="134" REF="027203_0143_0FD3D2DAB6F1C3F0">
fruit, which does not make its appearance till years after the child is born?</P>
<P>Could a woman keep an accurate regi&s;ter of what happened in all the powerful moments of imagina|tion, during her &s;tate of pregnancy, &s;he then might probably be able to foretell the chief incidents, philo&s;ophical, moral, intellectual, and phy&s;iogno|monical, which &s;hould happen to her child. Ima|gination actuated by de&s;ire, love, or hatred, may, with more than lightning &s;wiftne&s;s, kill or enli|ven, enlarge, dimini&s;h, or impregnate, the organi|zed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with the germ of enlarging or dimini&s;h|ing wi&s;dom or folly, death or life, which &s;hall fir&s;t be unfolded at a certain time, and under certain circum&s;tances. This hitherto unexplored, but &s;ometimes deci&s;ive and revealed creative and chang|ing power of the &s;oul, may be, in its e&s;&s;ence, iden|tically the &s;ame with what is called faith working miracles, which latter may be developed and in|crea&s;ed by external cau&s;es, wherever it exi&s;ts, but cannot be communicated where it is not. A clo&s;er examination of the foregoing conjectures, which I wi&s;h not to be held for any thing more than con|jectures, may perhaps lead to the profounde&s;t &s;e|crets of phy&s;iognomy.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>E&s;&s;ay, by a late learned man of Oldenburg, (M. Sturtz), on Phy&s;iognomy, inter&s;per&s;ed with &s;hort Remarks, by the Author.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>"I AM as clearly convinced of the truth of phy&s;i|ognomy as Lavater, and of the all-&s;ignificance
<PB N="135" REF="027203_0144_0FD3D307D86339A0">
of each limb and feature. True it is that the mind may be read in the lineaments of the body, and its motions in the features, and their &s;hades.</P>
<P>"Connexion and harmony, cau&s;e and effect, exi&s;t through all nature; therefore between the external and internal of man. Our form is influ|enced by our parents, by the earth on which we walk, the &s;un that warms us with its rays, the food that a&s;&s;imilates it&s;elf with our &s;ub&s;tance, the inci|dents that determine the fortunes of our lives. The&s;e all modify, repair, and chi&s;&s;el forth the bo|dy, and the marks of the tool are apparent both in body and in mind. Each arching, each &s;inuo&s;ity of the external, adapts it&s;elf to the individuality of the internal. It is adherent and pliable, like wet drapery. Were the no&s;e but a little altered, Cae&s;ar would not be the Cae&s;ar with whom we are acquainted.</P>
<P>"When the &s;oul is in motion, it &s;hines through the body, as the moon through the gho&s;ts of O&s;&s;i|an, each pa&s;&s;ion throughout the human race has ever the &s;ame language."</P>
<P>From ea&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, which are not marked with inverted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">mas, are the ob&s;ervations of M. Lavater, on the different parts of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> E&s;&s;ay.</NOTE> to we&s;t, envy no where looks with the &s;atisfied air of magnanimity, nor will di&s;content appear like patience. Wherever patience is, there is it expre&s;&s;ed by the &s;ame &s;igns; as likewi&s;e are anger, envy, and every other pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>"Philoctetes certainly expre&s;&s;es not the &s;en&s;a|tion of pain like a &s;courged &s;lave. The angels of Raphael mu&s;t &s;mile more nobly than the angels of Rembrandt; but joy and pain &s;till have each their peculiar expre&s;&s;ion. They act according to pecu|liar laws upon peculiar mu&s;cles and nerves, howe|ver various may be the &s;hades of their expre&s;&s;ion;
<PB N="136" REF="027203_0145_0FD3D3539F946578">
and the oftener the pa&s;&s;ion is repeated, or &s;et in motion, the more it becomes a propen&s;ity, a fa|vourite habit, the deeper will be the furrows it ploughs.</P>
<P>"But inclination, capacity, modes and grada|tions of capacity, talents, and an ability for bu&s;i|ne&s;s, lie much more concealed. A good ob&s;erver will di&s;cover the wrathful, the voluptuous, the proud, the di&s;contented, the malignant, the bene|volent, and the compa&s;&s;ionate, with little difficulty. But the philo&s;opher, the poet, the arti&s;t, and their various partitions of genius, he will be unable to determine with equal accuracy. And it will be &s;till more difficult to a&s;&s;ign the feature or trait in which the token of each quality is &s;eaten, whether under&s;tanding be in the eyebone, wit in the chin, and poetical genius in the mouth."</P>
<P>Yet I hope, I believe, nay, I know, that the pre|&s;ent century &s;hall render this po&s;&s;ible. The pene|trating author of this e&s;&s;ay would not only have found it po&s;&s;ible, but would have performed it him|&s;elf, had he only &s;et apart a &s;ingle day to compare and examine a well-arranged collection of charac|ters, either in nature, or well-painted portraits.</P>
<P>"Our attention is always excited whenever we meet with a remarkable man, and we all are more or le&s;s empirical phy&s;iognomi&s;ts. We perceive in the a&s;pect, the mien, the &s;mile, mechani&s;m of the forehead, &s;ometimes malice, &s;ometimes wit, at others penetration. We expect and pre&s;age, from the impul&s;e of latent &s;en&s;ation, very determined qualities, from the form of each new acquaint|ance; and, when this faculty of judging is impro|ved by an intercour&s;e with the world, we often &s;ucceed to admiration in our judgment on &s;tran|gers.</P>
<P>"Can we call this feeling, internal unacquired &s;en&s;ation, which is inexplicable, or is it compari&s;on,
<PB N="137" REF="027203_0146_0FD3D35510D4F5C0">
indication, conclu&s;ion from a character we have examined to another which we have not, and oc|ca&s;ioned by &s;ome external re&s;emblance? Feeling is the aegis of enthu&s;ia&s;ts and fools, and, though it may often be conformable to truth, is &s;till nei|ther demon&s;tration nor confirmation of truth; but induction is judgment founded on experience, and this way only will I &s;tudy phy&s;iognomy.</P>
<P>"I meet many &s;trangers, with an air of friend|&s;hip, I recede from others with cool politene&s;s, though there is no expre&s;&s;ion of pa&s;&s;ion to attract, or to di&s;gu&s;t. On farther examination, I always found, that I have &s;een in them &s;ome trait either of a worthy or worthle&s;s per&s;on, with whom I was before acquainted.</P>
<P>"A child, in my opinion acts from like motives, when he evades, or is plea&s;ed with, the care&s;&s;es of &s;trangers, except that he is actuated by more tri|fling &s;igns, perhaps by the colour of the clothes, the tone of the voice, or often by &s;ome motion, which he has ob&s;erved in the parent, the nur&s;e, or the acquaintance."</P>
<P>This cannot be denied to be often the ca&s;e, and indeed much more often than is commonly &s;uppo|&s;ed; yet I make no doubt of being able to prove, that there are, in nature and art, a multitude of traits, e&s;pecially of the extremes of pa&s;&s;ionate as well as di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate faculties, which, of them&s;elves, and without compari&s;on with former experiments, are, with certainty, intelligible to the mo&s;t unprac|ti&s;ed ob&s;erver. I believe it to be incorporated in the nature of man, in the organization of our eyes and ears, that he &s;hould be attracted or repul&s;ed by certain countenances, as well as by certain tones. Let a child, who has &s;een but a few men, view but the open jaws of a lion, or a tyger, and the &s;mile of a benevolent per&s;on, and his nature will infallibly &s;hrink from the one, and meet the &s;mile
<PB N="138" REF="027203_0147_0FD3D398D963FC18">
of benevolence with a &s;mile; not from rea&s;on and compari&s;on, but from the original feelings of na|ture. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, we li&s;ten with plea|&s;ure to a delightful melody, and &s;hudder at di&s;|cordant &s;hrieks. As little as there is of compari|&s;on or con&s;ideration on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, &s;o is there equally little on the fir&s;t &s;ight of an extreme|ly plea&s;ing, or an extremely di&s;gu&s;ting countenance.</P>
<P>"It is not therefore mere &s;en&s;ation, &s;ince I have good rea&s;on, when I meet a per&s;on who re&s;embles Turenne, to expect &s;agacity, cool re&s;olution, and ardent enterprize. If, in three men, I find one po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the eyes of Turenne, and the &s;ame marks of prudence&punc; another with his no&s;e, and high courage; the third with his mouth and acti|vity; I then have a&s;certained the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">at where each quality expre&s;&s;es it&s;elf, and am ju&s;tified in expect|ing &s;imilar qualities wherever I meet &s;imilar fea|tures.</P>
<P>"Had we, for centuries pa&s;t, examined the hu|man form, arranged characteri&s;tic features, compa|red traits, and exemplified inflexions, lines, and proportions, and had we added explanations to each, then would our Chine&s;e alphabet of the race of man be complete, and we need but open it to find the interpretation of any countenance. Whenever I indulge the &s;uppo&s;ition, that &s;uch an elementary work is not ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible, I ex|pect more from it than even Lavater. I imagine we may obtain a language &s;o rich, and &s;o determi|nate, that it &s;hall be po&s;&s;ible, from de&s;cription only, to re&s;tore the living figure; and that an accurate de&s;cription of the mind &s;hall give the outline of the body, &s;o that the phy&s;iognomi&s;t, &s;tudying &s;ome future Plutarch, &s;hall regenerate great men, and the ideal form &s;hall, with facility, take birth from the given definition."</P>
<P>This is excellent; and, be the author in je&s;t or earne&s;t; this is what I entirely, without dreaming,
<PB N="139" REF="027203_0148_0FD3D35EC8AF53E0">
and mo&s;t ab&s;olutely, expect from the following century, for which purpo&s;e, with God's plea&s;ure, I will hereafter hazard &s;ome e&s;&s;ays.</P>
<P>"With the&s;e ideal forms &s;hall the chambers of future princes be hung, and he who comes to &s;o|licit employment, &s;hall retire without murmuring, when it is proved to him that he is excluded by his no&s;e."</P>
<P>Laugh or laugh not, friends or enemies of truth, this will, this mu&s;t happen.</P>
<P>"By degrees, I imagine to my&s;elf a new, and another world, whence error and deceit &s;hall be bani&s;hed."</P>
<P>Bani&s;hed they would be were phy&s;iognomy the univer&s;al religion, were all men accurate ob&s;ervers, and were not di&s;&s;imulation obliged to recur to new arts, by which phy&s;iognomy, at lea&s;t for a time, may be rendered erroneous.</P>
<P>"We have to inquire, whether we &s;hould there|fore be happier?"</P>
<P>Happier we &s;hould certainly be, although the pre&s;ent conte&s;t between virtue and vice, &s;incerity and di&s;&s;imulation, which &s;o contributes to the de|velopement of the grand faculties of man, renders, as I may &s;ay, human virtue divine, exalting it to heaven.</P>
<P>"Truth is ever found in the medium: we will not hope too little from phy&s;iognomy, nor will we expect too much. Here torrents of objections break in upon me, &s;ome of which I am unable to an&s;wer. Do &s;o many men in reality re&s;emble each other? Is not the re&s;emblance general; and when particularly examined, does it not vani&s;h, e&s;pecially if the re&s;embling per&s;ons be compared feature by feature? Does it not happen, that one feature is in direct contradiction to another; that a fearful no&s;e is placed between eyes which betoken courage?"</P>
<P>In the firm parts, or tho&s;e capable of &s;harp out|lines,
<PB N="140" REF="027203_0149_0FD3D39C1A53C6D0">
accidents excepted, I have never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> found contradictory features, but often have between the firm and the flexible, or the ground-form of the flexible and their apparent &s;ituation. By ground-form I mean to &s;ay that which is pre&s;erved after death, unle&s;s di&s;torted by violent di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>"It is far from being proved, that re&s;emblance of form univer&s;ally denotes re&s;emblance of mind. In families where there is mo&s;t re&s;emblance, there are often the greate&s;t varieties of mind. I have known twins, not to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other, between who&s;e minds there was not the lea&s;t &s;imilarity."</P>
<P>If this be literally true, I will renounce phy&s;iog|nomy, and to whoever &s;hall convince me of it, I will give him my copy of the&s;e fragments, and an hundred phy&s;iognomonical drawings. Nor will I be my own judge, I leave it to the worthy author of this remark to choo&s;e three arbitrators. Let them examine the fact accurately, and, if they con|firm it, I will own my error. Shades, however, of the&s;e twin brothers will fir&s;t be nece&s;&s;ary. In all the experiments I have made, I declare upon my honour, I have never made any &s;uch remark.</P>
<P>"And how &s;hall we be able to explain the in|numerable exceptions which almo&s;t overwhelm rule? I will only produce &s;ome from my own ob&s;ervation. Dr. John&s;on had the appearance of a porter; not the glance of the eye, not any trait of the mouth, &s;peak the man of penetration or of &s;cience."</P>
<P>When a per&s;on of our author's penetration and judgment thus affirms, I mu&s;t he&s;itate and &s;ay, he has ob&s;erved this, I have not. But how does it happen, that, in more than ten years ob&s;erva|tion, I have never met any &s;uch example? I have &s;een many men, e&s;pecially in the beginning of my phy&s;iognomonical &s;tudies, whom I &s;uppo&s;ed to be men of &s;en&s;e, and who were not &s;o; but never, to
<PB N="141" REF="027203_0150_0FD3D3286C4D3B78">
the be&s;t of my knowledge, did I meet a wi&s;e man whom I &s;uppo&s;ed a fool. In the fronti&s;piece is an engraving of John&s;on. Can a countenance more tranquilly fine be imagined, one that more po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the &s;en&s;ibility of under&s;tanding, planning, &s;crutinizing? In the eyebrows only, and their ho|rizontal po&s;ition, how great is the expre&s;&s;ion of profound, exqui&s;ite, penetrating under&s;tanding!</P>
<P>"The countenance of Hume, was that of a common man."</P>
<P>So &s;ays common report. I have no an&s;wer but that I &s;u&s;pect the a&s;pect, or flexible features, on which mo&s;t ob&s;ervers found their phy&s;iognomoni|cal judgment, have, as I may &s;ay, effaced the phy|&s;iognomy of the bones; as, for example, the out|line and arching of the forehead, to which &s;carcely one in a hundred direct their attention.</P>
<P>"Churchill had the look of a drover; Gold|&s;mith of a &s;impleton; and the cold eyes of Strange do not betray the arti&s;t."</P>
<P>The greate&s;t arti&s;ts have often the colde&s;t eyes. The man of genius and the arti&s;t are two per&s;ons. Phlegm is the inheritance of the mere arti&s;t.</P>
<P>"Who would &s;ay, that the apparent ardour of Wille &s;peaks the man who pa&s;&s;ed his life in draw|ing parallel lines?"</P>
<P>Ardour and phlegm are not incompatible; the mo&s;t ardent men are the coole&s;t. Scarcely any ob&s;ervation has been &s;o much verified as this: it appears contradictory, but it is not. Ardent, quickly determining, re&s;olute, laborious, and boldly enterprizing men, the moments of ardour except|ed, have the coole&s;t of minds. The &s;tyle and coun|tenance of Wille, if the profile portrait of him in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion be a likene&s;s, have this character in perfection.</P>
<P>"It appears to me, that Boucher the painter of the graces, has the a&s;pect of an executioner."</P>
<P>Truly &s;o. Such was the portrait I received.
<PB N="142" REF="027203_0151_0FD3D358FAD60300">
But then, my good M. Sturtz, let us under&s;tand what is meant by the&s;e painters of the graces. I find as little in his works, as in his countenance. None of the paintings of Boucher were at all to my ta&s;te. I could not contemplate one of them with plea&s;ure, and his countenance had the &s;ame effect. I can now comprehend, &s;aid I, on the fir&s;t &s;ight of his portrait, why I have never been plea&s;ed with the works of Boucher.</P>
<P>"I once happened to &s;ee a criminal condemned to the wheel, who, with &s;atanic wickedne&s;s, had murdered his benefactor, and who yet had the be|nevolent and open countenance of an angel of Guido. It is not impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;cover the head of a Regulus among guilty criminals, or of a ve&s;tal in the hou&s;e of correction."</P>
<P>I can confirm this from experience. Far be contradiction from me on this &s;ubject. But &s;uch vicious per&s;ons, however hateful with re&s;pect to the appearance and effect of their actions, or even to their internal motives, were not originally wicked. Where is the pure, the noble, finely formed, ea&s;ily irritated man, with angelic &s;en&s;ibi|lity, who has not his devili&s;h moments, in which, were not opportunity happily wanting, he might, in one hour, be guilty of &s;ome two or three vices, which would exhibit him, apparently at lea&s;t, as the mo&s;t dete&s;table of men; yet may he be a thou|&s;and times better and nobler than numerous men of &s;ubaltern minds, held to be good, who never were capable of committing acts &s;o wicked, for the com|mi&s;&s;ion of which they &s;o loudly condemn him, and, for the good of &s;ociety, are in duty bound to condemn?</P>
<P>"Lavater will an&s;wer, &s;how me the&s;e men, and I will comment upon them, as I have done upon Socrates. Some &s;mall, often unremarked trait, will probably explain what appears to you &s;o enig|matical.
<PB N="143" REF="027203_0152_0FD3D306B2B5F6D0">
But will not &s;omething creep into the commentary, which never was in the text?"</P>
<P>Though this may be, yet it ought not to be the ca&s;e. I will al&s;o grant, that a man with a good countenance may act like a rogue; but, in the fir&s;t place, at &s;uch a moment, his countenance will not appear good; and, in the next, he will infi|nitely oftener act like a man of worth.</P>
<P>"Have we any right, from a known character, to draw conclu&s;ions concerning one unknown? or, is it ea&s;y to di&s;cover what that being is, who wanders in darkne&s;s, and dwells in the hou&s;e of contradiction; who is one creature to-day, and to|morrow the very rever&s;e?"</P>
<P>How true, how important is this! How nece&s;|&s;ary a beacon to warn and terrify the phy&s;iogno|mi&s;t!</P>
<P>"What judgment could we form of Augu&s;tus, if we were only acquainted with his conduct to Cinna? or of Cicero, if we knew him only from his con&s;ulate? How gigantic ri&s;es Elizabeth among queens, yet how little, how mean, was the &s;uperannuated coquette! James II, a bold general, and a cowardly king! Monk, the revenger of mo|narchs, the &s;lave of his wife: Algernon Sydney and Ru&s;&s;el, patriots worthy of Rome, &s;old to France! Bacon, the father of wi&s;dom, a bribed judge!

<P>Their form &s;hows what they may, what they ought to be, and their a&s;pect, in the moment of action, what they are. Their countenance &s;hows their power, and their a&s;pect the application of their power. The expre&s;&s;ion of their littlene&s;s

<P>How excellently expre&s;&s;ed!</P>
<P>"A book written by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> on phy&s;iognomy, would certainly have been very different from that of Lavater. National phy&s;iognomy is &s;till a large uncultivated field. The families of the four cla&s;&s;es of the race of Adam, from the E&s;quimaux to the Greeks, in Europe, and in Germany alone, what varieties are there which can e&s;cape no ob&s;erver! Heads bearing the &s;tamp of the form of govern|ment, which ever will influence education; re|publican haughtine&s;s, proud of its laws; the pride of the &s;lave, who feels pride becau&s;e he has the power of inflicting the &s;courges he has received; Greeks under Pericles, and under Ha&s;&s;an Pacha; Romans, in a &s;tate of freedom, governed by em|perors, and governed by popes; Engli&s;hmen un|der Henry the Eighth, and Cromwell. How have I been &s;truck by the portraits of Hampden, Pym, and Vane! All produced varieties of beauty, ac|cording to the different nations."</P>
<P>I cannot expre&s;s how much I am indebted to the author of this &s;pirited and energetic e&s;&s;ay. How worthy an act was it in him, whom I had unintentionally offended, concerning whom I had publi&s;hed a judgment far from &s;ufficiently noble, to &s;end me this e&s;&s;ay, with liberty to make what u&s;e of it I plea&s;ed! in &s;uch a manner, in &s;uch a &s;pirit, may informations, corrections, or doubts be ever conveyed to me!

<P N="5">5. The external form of the head is what it ought to be, when it re&s;embles a hollow globe &s;lightly compre&s;&s;ed at the &s;ides with a &s;mall protu|berance at the forehead and back of the head. A very flat forehead, or a &s;udden de&s;cent at the back of the head, are no good tokens of under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>The profile of &s;uch a head, notwith&s;tanding the compre&s;&s;ure, would be more circular than oval. The profile of a good head ought to form a circle combined only when with the no&s;e; therefore, without the no&s;e it approaches much more to the oval than the circular. "A very flat forehead, (&s;ays our author) is no &s;ign of good under&s;tanding." True, if the flatne&s;s re&s;emble that of the ox; but
<PB N="146" REF="027203_0155_0FD3D36781668158">
I have &s;een perfectly flat foreheads, let me be rightly under&s;tood. I mean flat only between and above the eyebrows, in men of great wi&s;dom. Much indeed, depends upon the po&s;ition and curve of the outlines of the forehead.</P>

<P>Often, not always. And how wi&s;e? Wi&s;e to plan, but not to execute. Active wi&s;dom mu&s;t have harder bones. One of the greate&s;t of this earth's wonders is a man in whom the two qualities are united, who has &s;en&s;ibility even to painful ex|ce&s;s, and colo&s;&s;al courage to re&s;i&s;t the impetuous torrent, the whirlpool, by which he &s;hall be a&s;&s;ail|ed.

<P>With equal truth or fal&s;ehood, I may add, a thin belly, a thin under&s;tanding. Remarks &s;o general, which would prove &s;o many able and wi&s;e men to be fools, I value but little. A thick belly cer|tainly is no po&s;itive token of under&s;tanding, it is rather po&s;itive for &s;en&s;uality, which is detri|mental to the under&s;tanding; but ab&s;tractedly, and unconnected with other indubitable marks, I cannot receive this as a general propo&s;ition.</P>
<P N="10">10. "Ari&s;totle holds the &s;malle&s;t heads to be the wi&s;e&s;t."</P>
<P>But this, with all reverence for &s;o great a man,
<PB N="147" REF="027203_0156_0FD3D34B8F53B8A8">
I think was &s;poken without reflexion. Let a &s;mall head be imagined on a great body, or a great head on a &s;mall body, each of which may be found in con&s;equence of accidents that excite or retard growth; and it will be perceived that, without &s;ome more definite di&s;tinction, neither the large nor the &s;mall head is, in it&s;elf, wi&s;e or fooli&s;h. It is true, that large heads with &s;hort triangular fore|heads, are fooli&s;h; as are tho&s;e large heads which are fat, and incumbered with fle&s;h; but &s;mall, par|ticularly round heads, with the like incumbrance, are intolerably fooli&s;h, and generally po&s;&s;e&s;s that, which renders their intolerable folly more intole|rable, a preten&s;ion to wi&s;dom.</P>
<P N="11">11. "It is a good &s;ign, when a &s;mall per&s;on has a head &s;omewhat large, and a large per&s;on has the head &s;omewhat &s;mall."</P>
<P>Provided this extends no farther than <HI>&s;omewhat,</HI> it may be &s;uffered; but it is certainly be&s;t, when the head is in &s;uch proportion to the body, that it is not remarkable either for its largene&s;s or &s;mall|ne&s;s.</P>
<P N="12">12. "Memory and imagination re&s;emble the under&s;tanding as a monkey does a man."</P>
<P N="13">13. "It is if no con&s;equence to the genius, whe|ther the fle&s;h be hard or tender, if the brain do not partake of the &s;ame quality; for experience tells us, that the latter is very often of a different temperament to the other parts of the body. But when both the brain and the fle&s;h are tender, they betoken ill to the under&s;tanding, and equally ill to the imagination."</P>
<P N="14">14. "The fluids which render the fle&s;h tender, are phlegm and blood; and the&s;e being moi&s;t, ac|cording to Galen, render men &s;imple and &s;tupid. The fluids, on the contrary, which harden the fle&s;h, are choler and melancholy, (or bile) and the&s;e ge|nerate wi&s;dom and under&s;tanding. It is therefore
<PB N="148" REF="027203_0157_0FD3D3458F92A608">
a much wor&s;e &s;ign to have tender fle&s;h than rough; and tender &s;ignifies a bad memory, with weakne&s;s of under&s;tanding and imagination."</P>
<P>If I may &s;o &s;ay, there is an intelligent tenderne&s;s of fle&s;h, which announces much more under&s;tand|ing than do the oppo&s;ite qualities of rough and hard. I can no more cla&s;s coriaceous fle&s;h as the charac|teri&s;tic of under&s;tanding, than I can tenderne&s;s of fle&s;h, without being more accurately defined, as the characteri&s;tic of folly. It will be proper to di&s;|tingui&s;h between tender and porous, or &s;pongy, and between rough and firm without hardne&s;s.</P>
<P N="15">15. "To di&s;cover whether the quality of the brain corre&s;ponds with the fle&s;h, we mu&s;t examine the hair. If the hair be black, &s;trong, rough, and thick, it betokens &s;trength of imagination and un|der&s;tanding."</P>
<P>I am of a different opinion. Let not this be ex|pre&s;&s;ed in &s;uch general terms. At this moment, I recollect a very weak man, by nature weak, with exactly &s;uch hair. This roughne&s;s <HI>(&s;prodigk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it)</HI> is a fatal word, which, taken in what &s;en&s;e it will, never &s;ignifies any thing good.</P>
<P>"But if the hair be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ender and weak&punc; it denotes nothing more than goodne&s;s of memory."</P>
<P>Once more too little: it denotes a finer organi|zation, which receives the impre&s;&s;ion of images at lea&s;t as &s;trongly as the &s;igns of images.</P>
<P N="16">16. "When the hair is of the fir&s;t quality, and we would farther di&s;tingui&s;h, whether it betokens goodne&s;s of under&s;tanding or imagination, we mu&s;t pay attention to the laugh. Laughter betrays the quality of the imagination."</P>
<P>And I add, of the under&s;tanding, of the heart, of power, love, hatred, pride, humility, truth, and fal&s;ehood. Would I had arti&s;ts, who would watch for and de&s;ign the outlines of laughter! The phy|&s;iognomy of laughter would be the be&s;t of elemen|tary books for the knowledge of man. If the

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Remarks on an E&s;&s;ay on Phy&s;iognomy, by Profe&s;&s;or Litchtenberg.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THIS e&s;&s;ay is written with much intelligence, much ornament, and a mild diffu&s;ive elo|quence. It is the work of a very learned, penetra|ting, and, in many re&s;pects, highly meritorious per|&s;on, who appears to po&s;&s;e&s;s much knowledge of men, and a large portion of the prompt &s;pirit of ob&s;ervation. This e&s;&s;ay merits the utmo&s;t attenti|on and inve&s;tigation. It is &s;o intere&s;ting, &s;o com|prehen&s;ive, affords &s;o much opportunity of remark for the phy&s;iognomi&s;t, and of remarks which I have yet to make, that I cannot avoid citing the mo&s;t important pa&s;&s;ages, and &s;ubmitting them to an un|prejudiced and accurate examination.</P>
<P>It is far from my intention or wi&s;h to compare my&s;elf with the excellent author, to make any preten&s;ion to his fanciful and brilliant wit, and &s;till le&s;s to his learning and penetration. Though I could wi&s;h, I dare not hope, to meet and

an&s;wer him with the &s;ame elegance as his po|li&s;hed mind and fine ta&s;te &s;eem to demand. I am &s;en&s;ible of tho&s;e wants which are peculiar to my|&s;elf, and which mu&s;t remain mine, even when I have truth on my &s;ide. Yet, worthy Sir, be a&s;|&s;ured that I &s;hall never be unju&s;t, and that, even where I cannot a&s;&s;ent to your ob&s;ervations, I &s;hall never forget the e&s;teem I owe your talents, learn|ing, and merits.</P>
<P>Let us in &s;uppo&s;ition, &s;it down in friend&s;hip with your e&s;&s;ay before us, and, with that benevolence which is mo&s;t becoming men, philo&s;ophers in par|ticular, explain our mutual &s;entiments concerning nature and truth.</P>

<HEAD>ON PHYSIOGNOMY.</HEAD>
<P>"Certainly (&s;ays our author) the freedom of thought, and the very rece&s;&s;es of the heart, were never more &s;everely &s;crutinized than in the pre&s;ent age."</P>
<P>It appears to me that, at the very beginning, an improper point of view is taken, which may probably lead the author and reader a&s;tray through the whole e&s;&s;ay. For my own part, at lea&s;t, I know of no attacks on the freedom of thought, or the &s;ecret rece&s;&s;es of the heart. It is univer&s;ally known, that my labours have been le&s;s directed to this than to the knowledge of predominant charac|ter, capacities, talents, powers, inclinations, ac|tivity, genius, religion, &s;en&s;ibility, irritability, and ela&s;ticity, of men in general, and not to the di&s;covery of actual and pre&s;ent thought. As far as I am concerned, the &s;oul may, and can, in our witty author's own words, "brood as &s;ecretly over its trea&s;ures as it might have done centuries ago; may as tranquilly &s;mile at the progre&s;s of all Ba|bylonian works, at all proud a&s;&s;ailants of heaven, convinced that, long before the completion of
<PB N="151" REF="027203_0160_0FD3D360AD6E91C8">
their work, there &s;hall be a confu&s;ion of tongues, and the ma&s;ter and the labourers &s;hall be &s;cattered."</P>
<P>Nobody would laugh more than I at the arro|gance of that phy&s;iognomi&s;t, who &s;hould pretend to read in the countenance the mo&s;t &s;ecret thoughts and motions of the &s;oul, at any given moment, al|though there are moments, in which they are le|gible to the mo&s;t unpracti&s;ed phy&s;iognomi&s;t.</P>
<P>I am of opinion, likewi&s;e, the &s;ecrets of the heart belong to pathognomy, to which I direct my at|tention much le&s;s than to phy&s;iognomy; on which the author &s;ays, more wittily than truly, "It is as unnece&s;&s;ary to write on as the art of love.</P>
<P>The author is very right in reminding us, "that we ought to &s;eek phy&s;iognomonical in&s;truction from known characters with great caution, and even diffidence."</P>
<P>Our author then &s;ays, "Whether phy&s;iognomy, in its utmo&s;t perfection would promote philanthro|py, is at lea&s;t que&s;tionable."</P>
<P>I confidently an&s;wer unque&s;tionable, and I hope immediately to induce the rea&s;onable and philan|thropic author to &s;ay the &s;ame. Phy&s;iognomy, in its utmo&s;t perfection, mu&s;t mean the knowledge of man in its utmo&s;t perfection. And &s;hall not this promote the love of man? or, in other words, &s;hall it not di&s;cover innumerable perfections, which the half phy&s;iognomi&s;t, or the unphy&s;iognomi&s;t, are unable to di&s;cover? Noble and penetrating friend of man, while writing this, you had for|gotten what you had &s;o truly, &s;o beautifully &s;aid, "that the mo&s;t hateful deformity might, by the aid of virtue, acquire irre&s;i&s;tible charms." And to whom more irre&s;i&s;tible, more legible, than to the perfect phy&s;iognomi&s;t? irre&s;i&s;tible charms certainly promote not hatred, but love. From my own experience, I can &s;incerely declare, that the improvement of my phy&s;iognomonical knowledge
<PB N="152" REF="027203_0161_0FD3D339F4648D48">
has extended and increa&s;ed the power of love in my heart.</P>
<P>Though this knowledge may &s;ometimes occa&s;ion affliction, &s;till it is ever true, that the affliction oc|ca&s;ioned by certain countenances, endears, &s;ancti|fies, and renders enchanting whatever is noble and lovely, which often glows in the human counte|nance, like embers among a&s;hes. My attention to the di&s;covery of this &s;ecret goodne&s;s is increa&s;ed, and the object of my labours is its increa&s;e and improvement; and how do e&s;teem and love extend them&s;elves, wherever I perceive a preponderance of goodne&s;s! On a more accurate ob&s;ervation, the very countenances that afflict me, and which, for &s;ome moments, incen&s;e me again&s;t humanity, do but increa&s;e a tolerant and benevolent &s;pirit; for I then di&s;cern the load, and the nature of that &s;en&s;uality, again&s;t which they have to combat.</P>
<P>All truth, all knowledge of what is, of what acts upon us, and on which we act, promotes ge|neral and individual happine&s;s. Whoever denies this is incapable of inve&s;tigation. The more per|fect this knowledge is, the greater are its advan|tages. Whatever profits, whatever promotes hap|pine&s;s, promotes philanthropy. Where are happy men to be found without philanthropy? Are &s;uch beings po&s;&s;ible? Were happine&s;s and philanthropy to be de&s;troyed or le&s;&s;ened, by any perfect &s;cience, truth would war with truth, and eternal wi&s;dom with it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The man who can &s;eriou&s;ly maintain, "that a perfect &s;cience may be detrimental to human &s;oci|ety, or may not promote philanthropy, (without which happine&s;s among men cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed) is certainly not a man, in who&s;e company our au|thor would wi&s;h to philo&s;ophize, as certainly will he, with me a&s;&s;ume it as an axiom, that "the nearer truth, the nearer happine&s;s." The more our knowledge and judgment re&s;emble the knowledge
<PB N="153" REF="027203_0162_0FD3D2DF32ABC570">
and judgment of the Deity, the more will our phi|lanthropy re&s;emble the philanthropy of the Deity. He who knows how man is formed, who remem|bers that he is but du&s;t, is the mo&s;t tolerant friend of man.</P>
<P>Angels I believe to be better phy&s;iognomi&s;ts, and more philanthropic, than men, although they may perceive in us a thou&s;and failings and imper|fections, which may e&s;cape the mo&s;t penetrating eye of man. God, having the mo&s;t knowledge of &s;pirit, is the mo&s;t tolerant of &s;pirits. And who was more tolerant, more affectionate, more leni|ent, more merciful than thou, who <HI>neede&s;t not that any &s;hould te&s;tify of man, for thou knewe&s;t what was in man?</HI></P>
<P>"It is certain, that the indu&s;trious, the in&s;inu|ating, and active blockheads in phy&s;iognomy may do much injury to &s;ociety."</P>
<P>And as certainly worthy Sir, it is my earne&s;t de|&s;ire, my known endeavour, to deter &s;uch block|heads from &s;tudying phy&s;iognomy. This evil can be prevented only by accurate ob&s;ervation. True it is, that every &s;cience may become dangerous, when &s;tudied by the &s;uperficial and the fooli&s;h, and the very rever&s;e, when &s;tudied by the accurate and the wi&s;e. According to your own principles, therefore, we mu&s;t agree in this, that none but the &s;uperficial, the blockhead, the fanatical enemy of knowledge and learning in general, can wi&s;h to prevent "all inve&s;tigation of phy&s;iognomonical prin|ciples;" none but &s;uch a per&s;on "can oppo&s;e phy|&s;iognomonical labours; none but a blockhead will &s;uppo&s;e it unworthy and impracticable, in the&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> days, to awaken &s;en&s;ibility, and the &s;pirit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ob&s;ervation, or to improve the arts, and the knowledge of men."

Our author next proceeds to di&s;tingui&s;h between phy&s;iognomy and pathognomy.

To the latter the author ju&s;tly re|plies, "This no man ever yet denied, for what would all theatrical repre&s;entations be without it? The languages of all ages and nations abounds with pathognomonical remarks, and with which they are in&s;eparable interwoven."</P>
<P>However, after reading the work &s;everal times, I cannot di&s;cover whether the author does or does not grant the reality of phy&s;iognomy. In one pa&s;|&s;age, the author very excellently &s;ays, "No one will deny, that in a world where all things are cau&s;e and effect, and where miracles are not to be found, each part is a mirror of the whole. We are often able to conclude, from what is near to what is di&s;tant, from what is vi&s;ible to what is in|vi&s;ible, from the pre&s;ent to the pa&s;t and the future. Thus the hi&s;tory of the earth is written, in nature's characters, in the form of each tract of country, of its &s;ands, hills, and rocks. Thus each &s;hell on the &s;ea-&s;hore proclaims the once included mind, connected, like the mind of man, with this &s;hell. Thus al&s;o might the internal of man be expre&s;&s;ed, by the external, on the countenance, concerning which we particularly mean to &s;peak. Signs and traces of thought, inclination, and capacity mu&s;t
<PB N="155" REF="027203_0164_0FD3D347049E9A18">
be perceptible. How vi&s;ible are the tokens impre&s;&s;|ed upon the body by trade and climate! Yet what are trade and climate compared to the ever active &s;oul, created in every fibre, of who&s;e ab&s;olute legi|bility from all and to all no one doubts?"</P>
<P>From all mankind, rather than from the writer of this very excellent pa&s;&s;age, &s;hould I have expect|ed the following: "What! the phy&s;iognomi&s;t will exclaim, can the &s;oul of a Newton re&s;ide in the head of a Negro, or an angelic mind in a fiend-like form?"</P>
<P>As little could I have expected this pa&s;&s;age:&mdash;"Talents and the endowments of the mind, in ge|neral, are not expre&s;&s;ed by any &s;igns in the firm parts of the head."</P>
<P>I have never in my life met with any thing more contradictory to nature, and to each other, than the foregoing and the following paragraphs:</P>
<P>"If a pea were thrown into the Mediterranean, an eye more piercing than ours, though infinitely le&s;s penetrating than the eye of him who &s;ees all things, might perceive the effects produced on the coa&s;t of China." The&s;e are our author's very words.</P>
<P>And &s;hall the whole living powers of the &s;oul, "creative in every fibre," have no determinate in|fluence on the firm parts, tho&s;e boundaries of its activity, which fir&s;t were yielding, and acted upon, impre&s;&s;ed, by every mu&s;cle; which re&s;emble each other in no human body, which are as various as characters and talents, and are as certainly different as the mo&s;t flexible parts of man? Shall the whole powers of the &s;oul, I &s;ay, have no determinate in|fluence on the&s;e, or not by the&s;e be defined?</P>
<P>In order to avoid the future imputation of in|dulging the &s;hallow &s;tream of youthful declamati|on, in&s;tead of producing facts, and principles dedu|ced from experience, let us oppo&s;e experience to declamation, and facts to &s;ubtleties. But fir&s;t a
<PB N="156" REF="027203_0165_0FD3D2FDF8045118">
word, that we may perfectly remove a degree of ambiguity, which I &s;hould not have expected from the accuracy of a mathematician.</P>
<P>"Why not, (a&s;ks our author) why not the &s;oul of Newton in the head of a Negro? Why not an an|gel mind in a fiend-like form? Who, reptile! em|powered thee to judge of the works of God?"</P>
<P>Let us be rightly under&s;tood. We do not &s;peak here of what God can do, but of what is to be ex|pected from the knowledge we have of his works. We a&s;k what the Author of order actually does, and not whether the &s;oul of Newton can exi&s;t in the body of a Negro, or an angelic &s;oul in a fiend-like form. The phy&s;iognomonical que&s;tion is, can an angle's &s;oul act the &s;ame in a fiend-like body as in an angelic body? or, in other words, could the mind of Newton have invented the theory of light, re&s;iding in the head of a Negro, thus and thus de|fined? Such is the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Will you, Sir, who are the friend of truth, will you an&s;wer, it might? You, who have previou&s;ly &s;aid of the world, "all things in it are cau&s;e and effect, and miracles are not to be found."</P>
<P>I &s;hould indeed be a reptile, judging the works of God, did I maintain its po&s;&s;ibility by miracle; but the que&s;tion, at pre&s;ent, is not concerning mi|racles; it is concerning natural cau&s;e and effect.</P>
<P>Having thus clearly &s;tated the argument, permit me, Sir, to decide it, by quoting your own words: "Judas &s;carely could be that dirty, deformed men|dicant painted by Holbein. No hypocrite, who a&s;|&s;ociates with the good, betrays with a ki&s;s, and af|terwards hangs him&s;elf, has the look of Holbein's Judas. My experience leads me to &s;uppo&s;e Judas mu&s;t have been di&s;tingui&s;hed by an in&s;inuating countenance, and an ever-ready &s;mile."</P>
<P>How true! how excellent! yet what if I were to exclaim, "Who empowered thee, reptile! to judge of the work of God?" What if I were to
<PB N="157" REF="027203_0166_0FD3D340934A6E48">
retort the following ju&s;t remark, "Tell me fir&s;t, why a virtuous mind is &s;o often doomed to exi&s;t in an infirm body? Might not al&s;o, were it God's good plea&s;ure, a virtuous man have a countenance like the beggarly Jew of Holbein, or any other that can be imagined?"</P>
<P>Can this, however, be called wi&s;e or manly rea|&s;oning? How wide is the difference between &s;uf|fering and di&s;gu&s;ting virtue? or, is it logical to de|duce that, becau&s;e virtue may &s;uffer, virtue may be di&s;gu&s;tful? Is not &s;uffering e&s;&s;ential to virtue? To a&s;k why virtue mu&s;t &s;uffer, is equivalent to a&s;king why God has decreed that virtue &s;hould exi&s;t. Is it alike incongruous to admit that virtue &s;uffers, and that virtue looks like vice? Virtue void of conflict, of &s;uffering, or of &s;elf-denial, is not virtue accu|rately con&s;idered; therefore it is folly to a&s;k, why mu&s;t the virtuous &s;uffer? It is in the nature of things; but it is not in the nature of things, not in the relation of cau&s;e and effect, that virtues &s;hould look like vice, or wi&s;dom like fooli&s;hne&s;s. How, good Sir, could you forget what you have &s;o expre&s;&s;ively &s;aid, "There is no durable beauty without virtue, and the mo&s;t hateful deformity may, by the aid of virtue, acquire the mo&s;t irre&s;i&s;t|ible charms? The author is acquainted with &s;eve|ral women, who&s;e example might in&s;pire the mo&s;t ugly with hope."</P>
<P>What may be the infirmities of the virtuous we do not inquire, nor whether a man of genius may not become a fool; we a&s;k, whether virtue, while exi&s;ting, can look like pre&s;ent vice, or actual folly, like actual wi&s;dom? You Sir, who are &s;o profound an inquirer into the nature of man, will certainly never grant, (who, indeed, will?) that the &s;oul of the beloved di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t, could, without a mi|racle, re&s;ide in the dirty, deformed mendicant, the beggarly Jew of Holbein, and act as freely in that
<PB N="158" REF="027203_0167_0FD3D2D279715280">
as in any other body. Will you, Sir, continue to rank your&s;elf, in your philo&s;ophical re&s;earches, with tho&s;e, who having maintained &s;uch &s;en&s;ele&s;s propo&s;itions, rid them&s;elves of all difficulties by a&s;king, "Who impowered thee, reptile! to judge of the works of God?"</P>
<P>Let us proceed to examine a few more pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P>"Our &s;en&s;es acquaint us only with the &s;uperfi|cies, from which all deductions are made. This is not very favourable to phy&s;iognomy, for which &s;omething more definite is requi&s;ite, &s;ince this read|ing of the &s;uperficies is the &s;ource of all our errors, and frequently of our ignorance."</P>
<P>So it is with us in nature; we ab&s;olutely can read nothing more than the &s;uperficies. In a world de|void of miracles, the external ever mu&s;t have a re|lation to the internal; and, could we prove all read|ing of the &s;uperficies to be fal&s;e, what &s;hould we effect but the de&s;truction of all human knowledge. All our inquiries produce only new &s;uperficies. All our truth mu&s;t be the truth of the &s;uperficies. It is not the reading of the &s;uperficies that is the &s;ource of all our error; for, if &s;o, we &s;hould have not truth; but the not reading, or which is the &s;ame in effect, the not rightly reading.</P>
<P>If "a pea thrown into the Mediterranean &s;ea would effect a change in the &s;uperficies, which &s;hould extend to the coa&s;t of China," any error that we might commit, in our conclu&s;ions concerning the action of this pea, would not be becau&s;e we read only the &s;uperficies, but becau&s;e we cannot read the &s;uperficies.</P>
<P>"That we can only read the &s;uperficies is not very favourable to phy&s;iognomy, for which &s;ome|thing more definite is requi&s;ite." Something more definite we have continually endeavoured to give, and wi&s;h to hear the objections of acute inquirers. But let facts be oppo&s;ed to facts. Does not our author, by the expre&s;&s;ion, "&s;ince the internal is
<PB N="159" REF="027203_0168_0FD3D39CF5ACD070">
impre&s;&s;ed upon the external," &s;eem to grant the po&s;&s;ibility of this impre&s;&s;ion? And if &s;o, does not the &s;uperficies become the index of the inter|nal? Does he not thereby grant the phy&s;iognomy of the firm parts?</P>
<P>He proceeds to a&s;k, "If the internal be impre&s;&s;|ed upon the external, is the impre&s;&s;ion to be di&s;|covered by the eyes of men?" Dare I tru&s;t my eyes, that I have read &s;uch a pa&s;&s;age in the writings of a philo&s;opher!</P>
<P>We certainly &s;ee what we &s;ee. Be the object there, or be it not, the que&s;tion ever mu&s;t be, do we or do we not &s;ee? That we do &s;ee, and that the author, whenever he plea&s;es, &s;ees al&s;o, his e&s;&s;ay is a proof, as are his other works. Be this as it may, I know not what would become of all our philo&s;o|phers and philo&s;ophy, were we, at every new di&s;co|very of things, or the relation of things, to a&s;k, was this thing placed there to be di&s;covered? With what degree of ridicule would our witty author treat the man who &s;hould endeavour to render a&s;tronomy contemptible by a&s;king, "Though the wi&s;dom of God is manife&s;t in the &s;tars, were the &s;tars placed there to be di&s;covered?" "Mu&s;t not &s;igns and effects, which we do not &s;eek, conceal and render tho&s;e erroneous of which we are in &s;earch?"</P>
<P>The &s;igns we &s;eek are manife&s;t, and may be known: they are the terminations of cau&s;es, there|fore effects, therefore phy&s;iognomonical expre&s;&s;i|ons. The philo&s;opher is an ob&s;erver, an ob&s;erver of that which is &s;ought, or not &s;ought. He &s;ees, and mu&s;t &s;ee, that which pre&s;ents it&s;elf to his eyes; and that which pre&s;ents it&s;elf is the &s;ymbol of &s;ome|thing that does not pre&s;ent it&s;elf. What he &s;ees can only mi&s;lead him when he does not &s;ee rightly. If the conclu&s;ion be true, "that &s;igns and effects which we do not &s;eek mu&s;t conceal, and render er|roneous tho&s;e of which we are in &s;earch," then
<PB N="160" REF="027203_0169_0FD3D395C40D4AE0">
ought we to &s;eek no &s;igns and effects, and thus all &s;ciences vani&s;h.</P>
<P>I have rea&s;on to hope, that a per&s;on of &s;o much learning as is our author, would not &s;acrifice all human &s;ciences for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of heaping phy&s;iognomy on the pile. I grant the po&s;&s;ibility and facility of error is there; and this &s;hould teach us circum&s;pection, &s;hould teach us to &s;ee the thing that is, without the addition of any thing that is not. But to wi&s;h, by any pretence, to divert us from &s;eeing and ob&s;erving, and to render inquiry contemptible, whether with rude or refined wit, would be the mo&s;t ridiculous of all fanatici&s;m. Such ridicule, in the mouth of a profe&s;&s;ed enemy of fal&s;e philo&s;ophers, would be as vapid as fal&s;e. I am indeed per&s;uaded that my antagoni&s;t is only in je&s;t.</P>
<P>"Were the growth of the body (&s;ays the author) in the mo&s;t pure of atmo&s;pheres, and modified only by the emotions of the mind, undi&s;turbed by any external power, the ruling pa&s;&s;ion, and the pre|vailing talent, I allow, might produce, according to their different gradations, different forms of coun|tenance, like as different &s;alts cry&s;talize in differ|ent forms, when ob&s;tructed by no impediment. But is the body influenced by the mind alone, or is it not rather expo&s;ed to all the impul&s;es of various contradictory powers, the laws of which it is obli|ged to obey? Thus each mineral, in its pure&s;t &s;tate, has its peculiar form; but the anomalies which its combination with others occa&s;ions, and the acci|dents to which it is &s;ubjected, often cau&s;e the mo&s;t experienced to err, when they would di&s;tingui&s;h it by its form."</P>
<P>What a &s;imile! Salts and minerals compared to an organized body, internally animate! A grain of &s;alt, which the lea&s;t particle of water will in&s;tan|taneou&s;ly melt, to the human &s;cull, which has de|fied misfortunes, and millions of external impre&s;&s;i|ons
<PB N="161" REF="027203_0170_0FD3CB06A83434B0">
for centuries? Do&s;t not thou blu&s;h, Philo&s;o|phy? Not to confine our&s;elves to the organization of the &s;culls of men and other animals, do we find that even plants, which have not the internal re&s;i&s;t|ance, the ela&s;ticity of men, and which are expo&s;ed to millions of counteracting impre&s;&s;ions from light, air, and other bodies, ever change their form, in in con&s;equence of &s;uch cau&s;es? Which of them is ever mi&s;taken for another by the botani&s;t. The mo&s;t violent accidents &s;carcely could effect &s;uch a change, &s;o long as they &s;hould pre&s;erve their or|ganization.</P>
<P>"Thus is the body mutually acted upon by the mind and external cau&s;es, and manife&s;ts not only our inclinations and capacities, but al&s;o the effects of misfortune, climate, di&s;ea&s;es, food, and thou&s;ands of inconveniences to which we are &s;ubjected, not always in con&s;equence of our vice, but often by ac|cidents, and &s;ometimes by our virtues."</P>
<P>Who would, who can, deny this? But is the foregoing que&s;tion hereby an&s;wered? We are to attend to that. Does not our e&s;&s;aye&s;t him&s;elf &s;ay, "the body is acted upon by the mind and exter|nal cau&s;es?" Therefore not by external cau&s;es alone. May it not equally be affected by the in|ternal energy, or inactivity of the mind? What are we contending for? Has it not (if indeed the au|thor be in earne&s;t) the appearance of &s;ophi&s;try <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> oppo&s;e external to internal effects, and yet own the body is acted upon by both?

Who can &s;eriou&s;ly believe and affirm, that Charles XIV. Henry IV. and Charles V. men who were undoubtedly &s;ubject to misfor|tunes, if ever men were, thereby acquired another

form of countenance, (we &s;peak of the firm parts, not of &s;cars) and which forms denoted a different character to what each po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed previous to &s;uch misfortunes? Who will maintain, that the no&s;es of Charles XII. or Henry IV. denoting power of mind, previous to their rever&s;e of fortune, the one at Pultawa, the other by the hand of Ravaillac, &s;uf|fered any change, and were deba&s;ed to the in&s;igni|ficant pointed no&s;e of a girl? Nature acts from within upon the bones; accident and &s;uffering act on the nerves, mu&s;cles, and &s;kin. If any accident attack the bones; who is &s;o blind as not to remark &s;uch phy&s;ical violence? The &s;igns of misfortune are either &s;trong or feeble: when they are feeble, they are effaced by the &s;uperior &s;trength and pow|er of nature; when &s;trong, they are too vi&s;ible to deceive, and by their &s;trength and vi&s;ibility warn the phy&s;iognomi&s;t not to &s;uppo&s;e them the features of nature. By the phy&s;iognomi&s;t I mean the un|prejudiced ob&s;erver, who alone is the real phy&s;iog|nomi&s;t, and has a right to decide; not the man of &s;ubtlety, who is wilfully blind to experience.</P>
<P>"Are the defects, which I remark in an image of wax, always the defects of the arti&s;t, or are they not the con&s;equences of un&s;kilful handling, the &s;un's heat or the warmth of the room."</P>
<P>Nothing, dear friend of truth, is more ea&s;y to remark, in an image of wax, than the original hand of the ma&s;ter, although it &s;hould, by improper handling, accidental pre&s;&s;ure, or melting, be injured. This example, Sir, militates again&s;t your&s;elf. If the hand of the ma&s;ter be vi&s;ible in an image of wax, where it is &s;o ea&s;ily defaced, how much more perceptible mu&s;t accident be in an organized body, &s;o individually permanent? In&s;tead of an image of wax, the &s;imile, in my opinion, would be improved were we to &s;ub&s;titute a &s;tatue; and in this every connoi&s;&s;eur can di&s;tingui&s;h what has been broken, chopped, or filed off, as well as what has been add|ed
<PB N="163" REF="027203_0172_0FD3D348442A5860">
by a later hand. And why &s;hould not this be known in man? Why &s;hould not the original form of man be more di&s;tingui&s;hable, in de&s;pite of acci|dent, than the beauty and workman&s;hip of an ex|cellent &s;tatue which has been defaced?</P>
<P>"Does the mind, like an ela&s;tic fluid, always a&s;|&s;ume the form of the body? And if a flat no&s;e were the &s;ign of envy, mu&s;t a man, who&s;e no&s;e by accident &s;hould be flattened, con&s;equently become envious?"</P>
<P>The inquirer will gain but little, be this que&s;tion an&s;wered in the negative or affirmative. What is gained were we to an&s;wer, "Yes; the &s;oul is an ela&s;tic fluid, which always takes the form of the body?" Would it thence follow that the flattened no&s;e has lo&s;t &s;o much of its ela&s;ticity, as would be nece&s;&s;ary to propel the no&s;e? or where would be the advantage &s;hould we reply, "No; all &s;uch compari&s;ons are in&s;ignificant, except to elucidate certain ca&s;es: we mu&s;t appeal only to facts."</P>
<P>But what would be an&s;wered to a le&s;s &s;ubtle and more &s;imple que&s;tion? Is there no example of the mind being injured by the maiming of the body? Has not a fractured &s;cull, by compre&s;&s;ing the brain, injured the under&s;tanding? Does not ca&s;tration render the male half female?&mdash;But to an&s;wer wit with rea&s;on, &s;ays a witty writer, is like endeavour|ing to hold an eel by the tail.</P>
<P>We wholly &s;ub&s;cribe to the affirmation, that "it is ab&s;urd to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the mo&s;t beautiful mind is to be found in the mo&s;t beautiful body, and the mo&s;t deformed mind in the mo&s;t deformed body."</P>
<P>We have already explained our&s;elves &s;o amply on this &s;ubject, that being &s;uppo&s;ed to hold a contrary opinion appears incomprehen&s;ible. We only &s;ay, there is a proportion and beauty of body, which is more capable of &s;uperior virtue, &s;en&s;ibility, and ac|tion, than the di&s;proportionate. We &s;ay with the author, "Virtue beautifies, vice deforms." We

mo&s;t cordially grant, that hone&s;ty may be found in the mo&s;t ugly, and vice in men of the mo&s;t beauti|ful forms.</P>
<P>We however, differ from him, concerning the following a&s;&s;ertion: "Our languages are exceed|ingly barren of phy&s;iognomonical terms. Were it a true &s;cience, the language of the vulgar would have been proverbially rich in its terms. The no&s;e occurs in a <HI>hundred</HI> proverbs and phra&s;es, but al|ways pathognomonically, denoting pa&s;t action, but never phy&s;iognomonically, betokening character or di&s;po&s;ition."</P>
<P>In&s;tead of a <HI>hundred,</HI> I am acquainted with only one &s;uch phra&s;e, <HI>na&s;en rumfe,</HI> to turn up the no&s;e. <HI>Homo obe&s;ae, obtu&s;ae naris,</HI> &s;aid the ancients; and had they not &s;aid it, what could thence have been addu|ced, &s;ince we can prove <HI>&agrave; po&s;teriori,</HI> that the no&s;e is a phy&s;iognomonical &s;ign of character?</P>
<P>I have neither the learning nor the inclination to cite &s;ufficient proofs of the contrary from Home<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, Suetonius, Mar&s;hal, and an hundred others. That which is, is, whether perceived by the ancients or not. Such du&s;t might blind a &s;chool-boy, but not the eyes of a &s;age, who &s;ees for him&s;elf, and who knows that each age has its mea&s;ure of di&s;covery, and that there are tho&s;e who fail not to exclaim again&s;t all di&s;coveries which were not made by the ancients.</P>
<P>"I &s;hould be glad to know (&s;ays our author) not what man may become, but what he is?"</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s that I wi&s;h to know both. Many vicious men re&s;emble valuable paintings, which have been de&s;troyed by varni&s;h. Would you pay no attention to &s;uch a painting! Is it wholly un|worthy of you, though a connoi&s;&s;eur &s;hould a&s;&s;ure you, the picture is damaged; but there is a po&s;&s;ibi|lity of clearing away the varni&s;h, as this ma&s;ter's colours are &s;o &s;trongly laid on, and &s;o e&s;&s;entially good, that no varni&s;h can penetrate deep enough,

<P>I feel I grow weary, and perhaps weary others, e&s;pecially as I am more and more convinced, that

our plea&s;ant author, at lea&s;t hitherto, meant only to amu&s;e him&s;elf. I &s;hall therefore only produce two more contradictions, which ought not to have e&s;caped the author, and &s;carcely can e&s;cape any thinking reader.</P>
<P>In one place, he very excellently &s;ays, "Pathog|nomonical &s;igns, often repeated, are not always en|tirely effaced, but leave phy&s;iognomonical impre&s;&s;i|ons. Hence originate the lines of folly, ever gap|ing, ever admiring, nothing under&s;tanding; hence the traits of hypocri&s;y; hence the hollowed cheek, the wrinkles of ob&s;tinacy, and heaven knows how many other wrinkles. Pathognomonical di&s;tortion, which accompanies the practice of vice, will like|wi&s;e, in con&s;equence of the di&s;ea&s;e it produces, be|come more di&s;torted and hateful. Thus may the pathognomonical expre&s;&s;ion of friend&s;hip, compa&s;|&s;ion, &s;incerity, piety, and other moral beauties, be|come bodily beauty to &s;uch as can perceive and ad|mire the&s;e qualities. On this is founded the phy&s;i|ognomy of Gellert, which is the only true part of phy&s;iognomy. This is of infinite advantage to vir|tue, and is comprehended in a few words, "virtue beautifies, vice deform<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">"</P>
<P>The branch therefore hath effect, the root none: the fruit has phy&s;iognomy, the tree none; the laugh of &s;elf-&s;ufficient vanity may, therefore, ari&s;e from the mo&s;t humble of hearts, and the appear|ance of folly from the perfection of wi&s;dom. The wrinkles of hypocri&s;y, therefore, are not the re&s;ult of any internal power or weakne&s;s. The author will always fix our attention on the dial-plate, and will never &s;peak of the power of the watch it&s;elf. But take away the dial-plate, and &s;till the hand will go. Take away tho&s;e pathognomonical traits, which di&s;&s;imulation &s;ometimes can effect, and the internal power of impul&s;e will remain. How con|tradictory therefore is it to &s;ay, the traits of folly

are there, but not the character of folly, the drop of water is vi&s;ible, but the fountain, the ocean, is not!</P>
<P>Again. It is certainly incongruous to &s;ay, "There is pathognomy, but this is as unnece&s;&s;ary (to be written) as an act of love. It chiefly con&s;i&s;ts in the motion of the mu&s;cles of the countenance and the eyes, and is learned by all men. To teach this would be like an attempt to number the &s;ands of the &s;ea!"</P>
<P>Yet the author, in the very next page, with great acutene&s;s, begins to teach pathognomy, by explain|ing twelve of the countenances of Chodowiecki, in which how much is there included of the &s;cience of phy&s;iognomy!</P>
<P>Permit me now, my worthy antagoni&s;t, yet no longer antagoni&s;t, but friend, convinced by truth and the love of truth, I &s;ay, permit me to tran|&s;cribe, in one continued quotation, &s;ome of your excellent thoughts and remarks from your e&s;&s;ay, and elucidations on the countenances of Chodowi|ecki, part of which have been already cited in this fragment, and part not. I am convinced they will be agreeable to my readers.</P>
<P>"Our judgment concerning countenances fre|quently acquires certainty, not from phy&s;iognomo|nical nor pathognomonical &s;igns, but from the tra|ces of recent actions, which men cannot &s;hake off. Debauchery, avarice, beggary, have each their li|very, by which they are as well known as the &s;ol|dier by his uniform, or the chimney-&s;weeper by his &s;ooty jacket. The addition of a trifling expletive in di&s;cour&s;e will betray the badne&s;s of education; and the manner of putting on the hat what is the company we keep, and what the degree of our folly."</P>
<P>Suffer me here to add, &s;hall not then the whole form of man di&s;cover any thing of his talents and di&s;po&s;ition! Can the mo&s;t milky candour here for|get the &s;training at a gnat and &s;wallowing a camel!</P>

"Maniacs will often not be known to be di&s;or|dered in their &s;en&s;es, if not in action. More will often be di&s;covered, concerning what a man really is, by his dre&s;s, behaviour, and mode of paying his compliments at his fir&s;t vi&s;it and introduction, in a &s;ingle quarter of an hour, than in all the time he &s;hall remain.&mdash;(By unphy&s;iognomonical eyes, per|mit me to add.) Cleanline&s;s and &s;implicity of manner will often conceal pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>"Nothing, often, is to be &s;urmi&s;ed from the countenances of the mo&s;t dangerous men. Their thoughts are all concealed under an appearance of melancholy. Whoever has not remarked this, is unacquainted with mankind. The heart of the vi|cious man is always le&s;s ea&s;y to be read, the better his education has been, the more ambition he has, and the better the company he has been accu&s;tom|ed to keep.</P>

<P>"Specious as the objections brought by the &s;o|phi&s;try of the &s;en&s;ual may be, it is notwith&s;tanding certain that there is no po&s;&s;ible durable beauty with|out virtue, and the mo&s;t hateful deformity may, by the aid of virtue, acquire irre&s;i&s;tible charms. Ex|amples of &s;uch perfections, among per&s;ons of both &s;exes, I own are uncommon, but not more &s;o than heavenly &s;incerity, mode&s;t compliance, without &s;elf-degradation, univer&s;al philanthropy, without bu&s;y intru&s;ion, a love of order without being minute, or neatne&s;s without foppery, which are the virtues that produce &s;uch irre&s;i&s;tible charms.</P>

"Vice, in like manner, in per&s;ons yielding to its influence, may highly deform; e&s;pecially when, in con&s;equence of bad education, and want of know|ledge of the traits of moral beauty, or of will to a&s;&s;ume them, the vicious may find no day, no hour, in which to repair the ravages of vice.</P>
<P>"Who will not li&s;ten to the mouth, in which no trait, no &s;hade of fal&s;ehood is di&s;coverable? Let it preach the experience of what wi&s;dom, what &s;ci|ence it may, comfort will ever be the harbinger of &s;uch a phy&s;ician, and confidence ha&s;ten to welcome his approach.</P>
<P>"One of the mo&s;t hateful objects in the creati|on, &s;ays a certain writer, is a vicious and deformed old woman. We may al&s;o &s;ay, that the virtuous matron, in who&s;e countenance goodne&s;s and the ardour of benevolence are con&s;picuous, is an object mo&s;t worthy our reverence. Age never deforms the countenance, when the mind dares appear un|ma&s;ked: it only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ars off the fre&s;h varni&s;h, under which coquetry, vanity, and vice were concealed.

<P>"This is not difficult, and were men to act from conviction, in&s;tead of flattering them&s;elves with the hope of fortunate accidents, happy marriages would be more frequent; and as Shake&s;peare &s;ays, the bonds which &s;hould unite hearts would not &s;o often &s;trangle temporal happine&s;s."</P>
<P>This is &s;peaking to the heart. Oh! that I could have written my fragments in company with &s;uch an ob&s;erver! Who could have rendered greater &s;ervices to phy&s;iognomy than the man who, with the genius of a mathematician, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;o accurate a &s;pirit of ob&s;ervation?</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>General Remarks on Women.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Mu&s;t premi&s;e, that I am but little acquainted with the female part of the human race. Any man of the world mu&s;t know more of them than I can pretend to know. My opportunities of &s;eeing them at the theatre, at balls, or at the card-table, where they be&s;t may be &s;tudied, have been exceed|ingly few. In my youth, I almo&s;t avoided women, and was never in love.</P>
<P>Perhaps I ought, for this very rea&s;on, to have left this very important part of phy&s;iognomy to one much better informed, having my&s;elf &s;o little know|ledge of the fair &s;ex. Yet might not &s;uch neglect have been dangerous? Might another have treat|ed the &s;ubject in the manner which I could wi&s;h? or, would he have &s;aid the little I have to &s;ay, and which, though little, I e&s;teem to be nece&s;&s;ary and important?</P>
<P>I frequently &s;hudder while I think how exce&s;|&s;ively, how contrary to my intention, the &s;tudy of phy&s;iognomy may be abu&s;ed, when applied to wo|men. Phy&s;iognomy will perhaps fare no better
<PB N="172" REF="027203_0182_0FD3D32E346ABB50">
than philo&s;ophy, poetry, phy&s;ic, or whatever may be termed art or &s;cience. A little philo&s;ophy leads to athei&s;m, and much to Chri&s;tianity. Thus mu&s;t it be with phy&s;iognomy. But I will not be di&s;cou|raged; the half precedes the whole. We learn to walk by falling, and &s;hall we forbear to walk le&s;t we &s;hould fall?</P>
<P>I can with certainty &s;ay, that true pure phy&s;iog|nomonical &s;en&s;ation, in re&s;pect to the female &s;ex, be&s;t can &s;ea&s;on and improve life, and is the mo&s;t effectual pre&s;ervative again&s;t the degradation of our|&s;elves or others.</P>
<P><HI>Be&s;t can &s;ea&s;on and improve human life.</HI>&mdash;What bet|ter can temper manly rudene&s;s, or &s;trengthen and &s;upport the weakne&s;s of man, what &s;o &s;oon can a&s;|&s;uage the rapid blaze of wrath, what more charm ma&s;culine power, what &s;o quickly di&s;&s;ipate peevi&s;h|ne&s;s and ill temper, what &s;o well can wile away the in&s;ipid tedious hours of life, as the near and affec|tionate look of a noble, beautiful woman? What is &s;o &s;trong as her &s;oft delicate hand? What &s;o per&s;ua&s;ive as her tears re&s;trained? Who but be|holding her mu&s;t cea&s;e to &s;in? How can the &s;pirit of God act more omnipotently upon the heart, than by the extending and increa&s;ing phy&s;iogno|monical &s;en&s;ation for &s;uch an eloquent countenance? What &s;o well can &s;ea&s;on daily in&s;ipididity? I &s;carcely can conceive a gift of more paternal and divine benevolence!</P>
<P>This has &s;weetened every bitter of my life, this alone has &s;upported me under the mo&s;t corroding cares, when the &s;orrows of a bur&s;ting heart wanted vent. My eyes &s;wam in tears, and my &s;pirit groan|ed with angui&s;h. Then when men have daily a&s;k|ed, "where is now thy God?" when they rejected the &s;ympathy, the affection of my &s;oul, with rude contemptuous &s;corn; when acts of hone&s;t &s;implici|ty were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and the &s;acred impul&s;e of con&s;cious truth was ridiculed, hi&s;&s;ed at, and de&s;pi|&s;ed;

<ARGUMENT>
<P>General Remarks on Male and Female.&mdash;A Word on the Phy&s;iognomonical Relation of the Sexes.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>GENERALLY &s;peaking, how much more pure, tender, delicate, irritable, affectionate, flexi|ble, and patient, is woman than man! The prima|ry matter of which they are con&s;tituted appears to be more flexible, irritable, and ela&s;tic, than that of man. They are formed to maternal mildne&s;s and affection. All their organs are tender, yielding, ea&s;ily wounded, &s;en&s;ible, and receptible.</P>
<P>Among a thou&s;and females there is &s;carcely one without the generic feminine &s;igns, the flexible, the circular, and the irritable. They are the counter|part of man, taken out of man, to be &s;ubject to man; to comfort him like angels, and to lighten his cares. "She &s;hall be &s;aved in child-bearing, if they continue in faith, and charity, and holine&s;s, with &s;obriety." (1 Tim. ii. 15.)</P>
<P>This tenderne&s;s and &s;en&s;ibility, this light texture of their fibres and organs, this volatility of feeling render them &s;o ea&s;y to conduct and to tempt; &s;o ready of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the enterprize and power of the man; but more powerful through the aid of their charms than man, with all his &s;trength. The man was not fir&s;t tempted, but the woman, after|wards the man by the woman. And not only ea&s;i|ly to be tempted, &s;he is capable of being formed to
<PB N="176" REF="027203_0186_0FD3D31D91486C58">
the pure&s;t, noble&s;t, mo&s;t &s;eraphic virtue; to every thing which de&s;erve prai&s;e or affection.</P>
<P>Highly &s;en&s;ible of purity, beauty and &s;ymmetry, &s;he does not always take time to reflect on internal life, internal death, internal corruption. "The woman &s;aw that the tree was good for food, and that it was plea&s;ant to the eyes and a tree to be de&s;ired to make one wi&s;e, and &s;he took of the fruit thereof."</P>
<P>The female thinks not profoundly; profound thought is the power of the man. Women feel more: &s;en&s;ibility is the power of the woman. They often rule more effectually, more &s;overeignly than man. They rule with tender looks, tears, and &s;ighs, but not with pa&s;&s;ion and threats; for, if they &s;o rule, they are no longer women, but abortions.</P>
<P>They are capable of the &s;weete&s;t &s;en&s;ibility, the mo&s;t profound emotion, the utmo&s;t humility, and the exce&s;s of enthu&s;ia&s;m. In their countenance are the &s;igns of &s;anctity and inviolability, which every feeling man honours, and the effects of which are often miraculous. Therefore, by the irritabi|lity of their nerves, their incapacity for deep inqui|ry and firm deci&s;ion, they may ea&s;ily, from their extreme &s;en&s;ibility, become the mo&s;t irreclaimable, the mo&s;t rapturous enthu&s;ia&s;ts.</P>
<P>The love of woman, &s;trong and rooted as it is, is very changeable; their hatred almo&s;t incurable, and only to be effaced by continued and artful flat|tery. Men are mo&s;t profound, women are more &s;ublime. Men mo&s;t embrace the whole; women remark individually, and take more delight in &s;e|lecting the minutiae which form the whole. Man hears the bur&s;ting thunders, views the de&s;tructive bolt with &s;erene a&s;pect, and &s;tands erect amid&s;t the fearful maje&s;ty of the &s;treaming clouds. Woman trembles at the lightning and the voice of di&s;tant thunder, and &s;hrinks into her&s;elf, or &s;inks into the arms of man.</P>

A ray of light is &s;ingly received by man, woman delights to view it through a pri&s;m, in all its daz|zling colours. She contemplates the rainbow as the promi&s;e of peace; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e extends his inquiring eye over the whole horizon.</P>
<P>Woman laughs, man &s;miles; woman weeps, man remains &s;ilent. Woman is in angui&s;h when man weeps, and in de&s;pair when man is in angui&s;h; yet has &s;he often more faith than man.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>On the Phy&s;iognomy of Youth. Extracts from Zimmermann's Life of Haller.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>"THE fir&s;t years of the youth include the hi&s;|tory of the man. They develope the qua|lities
<PB N="179" REF="027203_0189_0FD3D326372DCB20">
of the &s;oul, the materials of future conduct, and the true features of temperament. In riper years di&s;&s;imulation prevails, or, at lea&s;t, that modi|fication of our thoughts, which is the con&s;equence of experience and knowledge.</P>
<P>"The characteri&s;tics of the pa&s;&s;ions, which are undeniably di&s;covered to us by the peculiar art de|nominated phy&s;iognomy, are effaced in the counte|nance by age; while, on the contary, their true &s;igns are vi&s;ible in youth. The original materials of man are unchangeable; he is drawn in colours that have no deceit. The boy is the work of na|ture, the man of art."</P>
<P>How much of the true, how much of the fal&s;e, worthy Zimmermann, at lea&s;t of the indefinite, is there in this pa&s;&s;age! According to my conception, I &s;ee the clay, the ma&s;s, in the youthful counte|nance; but not the form of the future man. There are pa&s;&s;ions and powers of youth, and pa&s;&s;ions and powers of age. The&s;e often are contradictory in the &s;ame man, yet are they contained one within the other. Time produces the expre&s;&s;ion of latent traits. A man is but a boy &s;een through a magni|fying gla&s;s, I always, therefore, perceive more in the countenance of a man than of a boy. Di&s;&s;i|mulation may indeed conceal the moral materials, but not alter their form. The growth, of powers and pa&s;&s;ions, imparts to the fir&s;t undefined &s;ketch of what is called a boy's countenance, the firm traits, &s;hading, and colouring, of manhood.</P>
<P>The&s;e are youthful countenances, which declare whether they ever &s;hall, or &s;hall not, ripen into man. This they declare, but they only declare it to the great phy&s;iognomi&s;t. I will acknowledge, when, which &s;eldom happens, the form of the head is beautiful, con&s;picuous, proportionate, greatly featured, well defined, and not too feebly coloured, it will be difficult that the re&s;ult &s;hould be common or vulgar. I likewi&s;e know, that where the form
<PB N="180" REF="027203_0190_0FD3D38F745E24A8">
is di&s;torted, e&s;pecially when it is tran&s;ver&s;e, extend|ed, undefined, or too har&s;hly defined, much can rarely be expected. But how much do the forms of youthful countenances change, even in the &s;y&s;|tem of the bones?</P>
<P>Much has been &s;aid of the openne&s;s, undegenera|cy, &s;implicity, and ingenuou&s;ne&s;s of a childi&s;h and youthful countenance. It may be &s;o, but for my own part, I mu&s;t own, I am not &s;o fortunate as to be able to read a youthful countenance with the &s;ame degree of quickne&s;s and preci&s;ion, however &s;mall that degree, as one that is manly. The more I conver&s;e with and con&s;ider children, the more difficult do I find it to pronounce, with certainty, concerning their character. Not that I do not meet countenances, among children and boys, mo&s;t &s;tri|kingly and po&s;itively &s;ignificant; yet &s;eldom is the great outline of the youth &s;o definite as for us to be able to read in it the man. The mo&s;t remark|ably advantageous young countenances may ea&s;ily, through accident, terror, hurt, or &s;everity in pa|rents or tutors, be internally injured, without any apparent injury to the whole. The beautiful, the eloquent form, the firm forehead, the deep, &s;harp eye, the cheerful, open, free, quick-moving mouth remain; there will only be a drop of troubled wa|ter in what el&s;e appears &s;o clear; only an uncom|mon, &s;carcely remarkable, perhaps convul&s;ive moti|on of the mouth. Thus is hope overthrown, and beauty rendered indi&s;tinct.</P>
<P>As &s;implicity is the &s;oil for variety, &s;o is inno|cence for the products of vice. Simplicity, not of a youth, but of a child, in thee the Omni&s;cient on|ly views the progre&s;s of &s;leeping pa&s;&s;ion; the gentle wrinkles of youth, the deep of manhood, and the manifold and relaxed of age. Oh! how different was my infantine countenance to the pre&s;ent, in form and &s;peech! But as tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion follows in|nocence, &s;o doth virtue tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="027203_0191_0FD3D2FAE1AC50C8">
Doth the ve&s;&s;el &s;ay to the potter, "wherefore ha&s;t thou made me thus?&mdash;<HI>I am little, but I am I.</HI>" He who created me, did not create me to be a child but a man. Wherefore &s;hould I ruminate on the plea&s;ures of childhood, unburthened with cares? I am what I am. I will forget the pa&s;t, nor weep that I am no longer a child, when I contemplate children in all their loveline&s;s. To join the pow|ers of man with the &s;implicity of the child is the height of all my hopes. God grant they may be accompli&s;hed!</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Phy&s;iognomical Extracts from an E&s;&s;ay in&s;erted in the Deut&s;chen Mu&s;eum, a German Journal or Review.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>FROM this e&s;&s;ay I &s;hall extract only &s;elect thoughts, and chiefly none but tho&s;e which I &s;uppo&s;e to be importantly true, importantly fal&s;e, or ill defined.</P>
<P N="1">1. "Men with arched and pointed no&s;es are &s;aid to be witty, and that the blunt no&s;ed are not &s;o."</P>
<P>A more accurate definition is nece&s;&s;ary, which, without drawing, is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible. Is it meant by arched no&s;es, arched in length or in breadth? How arched? This is almo&s;t as indeterminate as when we &s;peak of arched foreheads. All foreheads are arched. Innumerable no&s;es are arched, the mo&s;t witty and the mo&s;t &s;tupid. Where is the highe&s;t point of arching? Where does it begin? What is its extent? What is its &s;trength?</P>
<P>It is true, that people with tender, thin, &s;harply defined, angular no&s;es, pointed below, and &s;ome|thing
<PB N="182" REF="027203_0192_0FD3D2EB4CA482E0">
inclined towards the lip, are witty, when no other features contradict the&s;e tokens; but that people with blunt no&s;es are not &s;o, is not entirely true. It can only be &s;aid of certain blunt no&s;es, for there are others of this kind extremely witty, though their wit is certainly of a different kind to that of the pointed no&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. "It is a&s;ked, (&s;uppo&s;ing for a moment, that the arched and the blunt no&s;e denote the pre&s;ence or ab&s;ence of wit) is the arched no&s;e the mere &s;ign that a man is witty, which &s;uppo&s;es his wit to ori|ginate in &s;ome occult cau&s;e, or is the no&s;e it&s;elf the cau&s;e of wit?"</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, &s;ign, cau&s;e, and effect, combined. Sign; for it betokens the wit, and is an involunta|ry expre&s;&s;ion of wit. Cau&s;e; at lea&s;t cau&s;e that the wit is not greater, le&s;s, or of a different quality, boundary cau&s;e. Effect; produced by the quanti|ty, mea&s;ure, or activity of the mind, which &s;uffers not the no&s;e to alter its form to be greater or le&s;s. We are not only to con&s;ider the form as form, but the matter of which it is moulded, the conforma|bility of which is determined by the nature and in|gredients of this matter, which is probably the ori|gin of the form.</P>
<P>True indeed it is, that there are blunt no&s;es, which are incapable of receiving a certain quantity of wit; therefore it may be &s;aid with more &s;ubtle|ty than philo&s;ophy, they form an in&s;uperable bar|rier.</P>
<P N="3">3. "The corre&s;pondence of external figures with internal qualities is not the con&s;equence of external circum&s;tances, but rather of phy&s;ical com|bination. They are related like cau&s;e and effect, or, in other words, phy&s;iognomy is not the mere image of internal man, but the efficient cau&s;e."&mdash;(I &s;hould rather &s;ay the limiting cau&s;e)&mdash;The form and arrangement of the mu&s;cles determine the mode of thought, and &s;en&s;ibility of the man."</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="027203_0193_0FD3D3573B4493B0">
I add, the&s;e are al&s;o determined by the mind of man.</P>
<P N="4">4. "A broad con&s;picuous forehead is &s;aid to de|note penetration. This is natural. The mu&s;cle of the forehead is nece&s;&s;ary to deep thought. If it be narrow and contracted, it cannot render the &s;ame &s;ervice as if &s;pread out like a &s;ail."</P>
<P>Without contradicting the general propo&s;ition of the author, I &s;hall here more definitely add, it is, if you plea&s;e generally true, that the more brain, the more mind and capacity. The mo&s;t &s;tupid animals are tho&s;e with lea&s;t brain, and tho&s;e with mo&s;t the wi&s;e&s;t. Man, generally wi&s;er, has more brain than other animals; and it appears ju&s;t, to conclude from analogy, that wi&s;e men have more brain than the fooli&s;h. But accurate ob&s;ervation teaches, that this propo&s;ition, to be true, requires much definition and limitation.</P>
<P>Where the matter and form of the brain are &s;imilar, there the greater &s;pace for the re&s;idence of the brain is, certainly the &s;ign, cau&s;e and effect of more and deeper comprehen&s;ion; therefore, <HI>caeteris pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ibus,</HI> a larger quantity of brain, and con&s;equent|ly a &s;pacious forehead, is more intelligent than the rever&s;e. But as we frequently live more conveni|ently in a &s;mall well-contrived chamber than in more magnificent apartments, &s;o do we find, that in many &s;mall, &s;hort foreheads, with le&s;s, or appa|rently le&s;s brain than others, the wi&s;e mind re&s;ides at its ea&s;e.</P>
<P>I have known many &s;hort, oblique, &s;traight-lined (when compared with others apparently arched, or really well-arched) foreheads, which were much wi&s;er, more intelligent, and penetrating, than the mo&s;t broad and con&s;picuous; many of which latter I have &s;een in extremely weak men. It &s;eems to me, indeed, a much more general propo&s;ition, that &s;hort compre&s;&s;ed foreheads are wi&s;e and under&s;tand|ing;
<PB N="184" REF="027203_0194_0FD3D2EA0BFA9AC8">
though this, likewi&s;e, without being more ac|curately defined, is far from being generally true.</P>
<P>But is it true, that large &s;pacious foreheads which, if I do not mi&s;take, Galen, and after him Huart, have &s;uppo&s;ed the mo&s;t propitious to deep thinking, which form a half &s;phere, are u&s;ually the mo&s;t &s;tupid. The more any forehead (I do not &s;peak of the whole &s;cull) approaches a &s;emi&s;pherical form, the more is it weak, effeminate, and incapa|ble of reflexion, and this I &s;peak from repeated experience.</P>
<P>The more &s;traight lines a forehead has, the le&s;s capacious it mu&s;t be; for the more it is arched, the more mu&s;t it be roomy, and the more &s;traight lines it has, the more mu&s;t it be contracted. This great|er quantity of &s;traight lines, when the forehead is not flat like a board, for &s;uch flatne&s;s takes away all under&s;tanding, denotes an increa&s;e of judgment, but a diminution of &s;en&s;ibility. There undoubted|ly are, however, broad, capacious foreheads, with|out &s;traight lines, particularly adapted to profound thinking; but the&s;e are con&s;picuous by their ob|lique outlines.</P>
<P N="5">5. What the author has &s;aid concerning enthu|&s;ia&s;ts, requires much greater preci&s;ion, before it ought to be received as true.</P>
<P>"Enthu&s;ia&s;ts are &s;aid commonly to have flat, perpendicular foreheads."</P>
<P>Oval, cylindrical, or pointed at top, &s;hould have been &s;aid, of tho&s;e enthu&s;ia&s;ts who are calm, cold-blooded, and always continue the &s;ame. Other enthu&s;ia&s;ts, that is to &s;ay, &s;uch as are &s;ubject to a variety of &s;en&s;ation, illu&s;ion, and &s;en&s;ual experi|ence, &s;eldom have cylindrical or &s;ugar-loaf heads. The latter, when enthu&s;ia&s;ts, heat their imaginati|on concerning words and types, the &s;ignification of which they do not under&s;tand, and are philo&s;ophi|cal, unpoetical enthu&s;ia&s;ts. Enthu&s;ia&s;ts of imagi|nation, or of &s;en&s;ibility, &s;eldom have flat forms of the countenance.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="185" REF="027203_0195_0FD3D364233E7DD0">
6. "Ob&s;tinate, like enthu&s;ia&s;tic per&s;ons, have perpendicular foreheads."</P>
<P>The perpendicular always denotes coldne&s;s, inac|tivity, narrowne&s;s; hence firmne&s;s, fortitude, per|tinacity, ob&s;tinacy, and enthu&s;ia&s;m, may be there. Ab&s;olute perpendicularity, and ab&s;olute folly, are the &s;ame.</P>
<P N="7">7. "Each di&s;po&s;ition of mind is accompanied by a certain appearance, or motion of the mu&s;cles <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> con&s;equently the appearance of man, which is natu|ral to, and ever pre&s;ent with him, will be accom|panied by, and denote, his natural di&s;po&s;ition of mind. Countenances are &s;o formed originally, that to one this, and to another that appearance is the ea&s;ie&s;t. It is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible for folly to a&s;|&s;ume the appearance of wi&s;dom, otherwi&s;e it would no longer be folly. The worthy man cannot a&s;|&s;ume the appearance of di&s;hone&s;ty, or he would be di&s;hone&s;t."</P>
<P>This is all excellent, the la&s;t excepted. No man is &s;o good as not, under certain circum&s;tances, to be liable to become di&s;hone&s;t. He is &s;o organized, that he may be overtaken by the plea&s;ure of &s;teal|ing, when accompanied by the temptation. The po&s;&s;ibility of the appearance mu&s;t be there as well as the po&s;&s;ibility of the act. He mu&s;t al&s;o be able to a&s;&s;ume the appearance of di&s;hone&s;ty, when he ob&s;erves it in a thief, without nece&s;&s;arily becoming a thief. The po&s;&s;ibility of a&s;&s;uming the appearance of goodne&s;s is, in my opinion, very different. The appearance of vice is always more ea&s;ily a&s;&s;umed by the virtuous, than the appearance of virtue by the vicious; as it is evidently much ea&s;ier to become bad when we are good, than good when we are bad. Under&s;tanding, &s;en&s;ibility, talents, genius, virtue, or religion, may with much greater facility be lo&s;t than acquired. The be&s;t may de&s;cend as low as they plea&s;e, but the wor&s;t cannot a&s;cend to the
<PB N="186" REF="027203_0196_0FD3D3B82E1B2D48">
height they might wi&s;h. The wi&s;e man may phy|&s;ically, without a miracle, become a fool, and the mo&s;t virtuous vicious; but the idiot-born cannot, without a miracle, become a philo&s;opher, nor the di&s;torted villain noble and pure of heart. The mo&s;t beautiful complexion may become jaundiced, may be lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t; but the negro cannot be wa&s;hed white. I &s;hall not become a negro becau&s;e, to imitate him I blacken my face, nor a thief, becau&s;e I a&s;&s;ume the appearance of a thief.</P>
<P N="8">8. "The phy&s;iognomi&s;t ought to inquire, what is the appearance the countenance can mo&s;t ea&s;ily a&s;&s;ume, and he will thence learn what is the di&s;po|&s;ition of mind. Not that phy&s;iognomy is therefore an ea&s;y &s;cience. On the contrary, this rather &s;hows how much ability, imagination, and genius, are ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the phy&s;iognomi&s;t. Attention mu&s;t not only be paid to what is vi&s;ible, but what would be vi&s;ible under various other circum&s;tances."</P>
<P>Excellent; and I add, that as a phy&s;ician can pre|&s;age what alteration of colour, appearance, or form &s;hall be the con&s;equence of a known di&s;ea&s;e, of the exi&s;tence of which he is certain, &s;o can the accurate phy&s;iognomi&s;t what appearances or expre&s;&s;ions are ea&s;y or difficult to each kind of mu&s;cle, and form of forehead, what action is or is not permitted, and what wrinkles may or may not take place, under any given circum&s;tances.</P>
<P N="9">9. "When a learner draws a countenance, we &s;hall commonly find it is fooli&s;h, and never malici|ous, &s;atirical, and the like. May not the e&s;&s;ence of a fooli&s;h countenance hence be ab&s;tracted? Cer|tainly; or what is the cau&s;e of this appearance? The learner is incapable of pre&s;erving proportion, and the &s;trokes are unconnected. What is the &s;tu|pid countenance? It is one, the parts of which are defectively connected, and the mu&s;cles improperly formed and arranged. Thought and &s;en&s;ation, therefore, of which the&s;e are the in&s;eparable in|&s;truments, mu&s;t be alike feeble and dormant.</P>
<P N="10"><PB N="187" REF="027203_0197_0FD3D45766FAE5A8">
10. "Exclu&s;ive of the mu&s;cles; there is ano|ther &s;ub&s;tance in the body, that is to &s;ay, the &s;cull, or bones in general, to which the phy&s;iognomi&s;t at|tends. The po&s;ition of the mu&s;cles depends on the&s;e. How might the mu&s;cle of the forehead have the po&s;ition proper for thought, if the fore|head bones, over which it is extended, had not the nece&s;&s;ary arches and &s;uperficies? The figure of the &s;cull, therefore, defines the figure and po&s;ition of the mu&s;cles, which define thought and &s;en&s;ation.</P>
<P N="11">11. "The &s;ame may be ob&s;erved of the hair, from the parts and po&s;ition of which conclu&s;ions may be drawn. Why has the Negro woolly hair? The thickne&s;s of the &s;kin prevents the e&s;cape of certain of the particles of per&s;piration, and the&s;e render the &s;kin opaque and black. Hence the hair &s;hoots with difficulty, and &s;carcely has it penetrated before it curls, and its growth cea&s;es.

<P>In my opinion our author is certainly in the right road. He is the fir&s;t who, to my knowledge, has perceived and felt the totality, the combination, the uniformity of the various parts of the human body. What he has affirmed, e&s;pecially concerning the hair, that we may from that make deductions concerning the nature of the body, and &s;till farther of the minds, the lea&s;t accurate ob&s;erver may con|vince him&s;elf is truth, by daily experience. White, tender, clear, weak hair, always denotes weak, de|licate, irritable, or rather a timid and ea&s;ily oppre&s;&s;|ed organization. The black and curly will never be found on the delicate, tender, medullary head.</P>

<P>"Much hair, much fat, therefore no part of the human body is more con&s;picuou&s;ly covered with hair than the head and armpits. From the ela&s;ti|city of the hair, deductions may with certainty be made to the ela&s;ticity of the character. The hair naturally betokens moi&s;ture, and may properly de|termine the quantity of moi&s;ture. The inhabitants of cold countries have hair more white, and, on the contrary, tho&s;e of hot countries, black. Lional Wafer ob&s;erves, that the inhabitants of the i&s;th|mus of Darien have milk-white hair. Few, if any, have green hair, except tho&s;e who work in copper mines. We &s;eldom find white hair betokening di&s;|hone&s;ty, but often dark brown or black, with light-coloured eyebrows. Women have longer hair than men. Men with long hair are always rather effeminate than manly. Dark hair is har&s;her than light, as is the hair of a man than that of a boy.</P>

To the wicked he is formidable; mild and friendly to the good. By nature he walks the earth, &s;wims by art, and flies by imagination. He tills the earth, and enjoys its fruits. His complexion is beautiful, his limbs firm, his countenance is comely, and beard ornamental. By imitating his body, the Greeks have thought proper to honour their de|ities.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>"THE relation between the male and female countenance is &s;imilar to that between youth and manhood. Our experience, that the deep, or &s;carcely vi&s;ible outline is in proportion to the depth or &s;hallowne&s;s of thought, is one of the
<PB N="192" REF="027203_0202_0FD3D3F35AA2B9C0">
many proofs that nature has impre&s;&s;ed &s;uch forms upon her creatures as &s;hall te&s;tify their qualities. That the&s;e forms or &s;igns are legible to the highly perceptive &s;oul is vi&s;ible in children, who cannot endure the deceitful, the tell-tale, or the revenge|ful; but run with open arms to the benevolent &s;tranger.</P>
<P>"We may properly divide our remarks on this &s;ubject into complexion, lines, and pantomime. That white, generally &s;peaking, is cheerful, and black, gloomy and terrific, is the con&s;equence of our love of light, which act &s;o degenerately, as it were, upon &s;ome animals, that they will throw them&s;elves into the fire; and of our abhorrence of darkne&s;s. The rea&s;on of this our love of light, is, that it makes us acquainted with things, provides for the &s;oul hungry after knowledge, and enables us to find what is nece&s;&s;ary, and avoid what is dan|gerous. I only mention this to intimate, that in this our love of light originates our inclination for every thing that is per&s;picuous. Certain colours are, to certain animals, particularly agreeable or di&s;agreeable."</P>
<P>What is the rea&s;on of this? Becau&s;e they are the expre&s;&s;ion of &s;omething which has a relation to their character, that harmonizes with it, or is di&s;|cordant. Colours are the effect of certain qualities of object and &s;ubject; they are therefore character|i&s;tic in each, and become more &s;o by the manner in which they are mutually received and repelled. This would be another immen&s;e field of inquiry, another ray of the &s;un of truth. All is phy&s;iog|nomy!</P>
<P>"Our di&s;like is no le&s;s for every thing which is clothed in dark colours; and nature has warned animals, not only again&s;t feeding on earth, but al&s;o on dark-green plants; for the one is as detrimental as the other. Thus the man of dark complexion terrifies an infant that is incapable of judging of his character.</P>

"So &s;trikingly &s;ignificant are the members of the body, that the a&s;pect of the whole attacks our feelings, and induces judgments as &s;udden as they are ju&s;t. Thus, to mention two extremes, all will acknowledge, at the fir&s;t a&s;pect, the elephant to be the wi&s;e&s;t, and the fi&s;h the mo&s;t &s;tupid of creatures.</P>
<P>"The upper part of the countenance, to the root of the no&s;e, is the fea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of internal labour, thought, and re&s;olution; the under, of the&s;e in ac|tion. Animals, with very retreating foreheads, have little brain, and the rever&s;e.</P>
<P>"Projecting no&s;e and mouth (the latter certain|ly not always) betoken per&s;ua&s;ion, &s;elf-confidence, ra&s;hne&s;s, &s;hamele&s;&s;ne&s;s, want of thought, di&s;hone|&s;ty, and all &s;uch feelings as are a&s;&s;embled in ha&s;ty expre&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>This is a deci&s;ion after the manner of the old phy&s;iognomi&s;ts condemning, and indefinite.</P>
<P>"The no&s;e is the &s;eat of deri&s;ion, its wrinkles contemn. The upper lip, when projecting, &s;peaks arrogance, threats, and want of &s;hame; the part|ing under-lip, o&s;tentation and folly. The&s;e &s;igns are confirmed by the manner and attitude of the head, when drawn back, to&s;&s;ed or turned round. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> expre&s;&s;es contempt, during which the no&s;e is active; the latter is a proof of extreme arro|gance, during which the projection of the under-lip is the &s;tronge&s;t.</P>
<P>"The in drawn lower part of the countenance, on the contrary, denotes di&s;cretion, mode&s;ty, &s;eri|ou&s;ne&s;s, diffidence, and its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ailings are tho&s;e of malice and ob&s;tinacy."</P>
<P>Not &s;o po&s;itive. The projecting chin is much oftener the &s;ign of craft than the retreating. The latter is &s;eldom &s;cheming and enterpri&s;ing.</P>
<P>"The &s;traight formation of the no&s;e betokens gravity; inbent and crooked, noble thoughts. The flat, pouting upper lip (when it does not clo&s;e well
<PB N="194" REF="027203_0204_0FD3D422A49DE6C0">
with the under,) &s;ignifies timidity; the lips re&s;em|bling each other, circum&s;pection of &s;peech.</P>
<P>"We may divide the face into two principal kinds. The fir&s;t is that in which the cheeks pre|&s;ent a flat &s;urface, the no&s;e projecting like a hill, and the mouth has the appearance of a &s;abre-wound, prolonged on an even &s;urface, while the line of the jaw-bone has but little inflection. Such a form makes the countenance more broad than long, and exceedingly rude, inexpre&s;&s;ive, &s;tupid, and in every &s;en&s;e confined. The principal charac|teri&s;tics are ob&s;tinacy and inflexibility.</P>
<P>"The &s;econd kind is, when the no&s;e has a &s;harp ridge, and the parts on both fides make acute an|gles with each other. The cheek bones are not &s;een, con&s;equently the mu&s;cular parts between them and the no&s;e are full and prominent. The lips retreat on each &s;ide of the mouth, a&s;&s;ume or open into an oval, and the jaw-bones come to a point at the chin."</P>
<P>This face denotes a mind more &s;ubtle, active, and intelligent.</P>
<P>"The better to explain my&s;elf, I mu&s;t here em|ploy the &s;imile of two &s;hips. The fir&s;t a merchant ve&s;&s;el, built for deep loading, has a broad bottom, and her ribs long and flat. This re&s;embles the broad, flat countenance. The frigate, built for &s;wift &s;ailing, has a &s;harp keel or bottom, her ribs forming acute angles. Such is the &s;econd counte|nance. Of the&s;e two extremes, the fir&s;t pre&s;ents to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e the image of the meane&s;t, mo&s;t contracted &s;elf-love; the &s;econd of the mo&s;t zealous, the noble&s;t philanthropy.</P>
<P>"I am &s;en&s;ible, that nature does not delight in extremes. Still the under&s;tanding mu&s;t take its departure from the&s;e as from a light-hou&s;e, e&s;peci|ally when &s;ailing in unknown &s;eas. The defects and exce&s;&s;es which are in all works of nature will then be di&s;covered, and one or both the boundaries a&s;certained.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="027203_0205_0FD3D3D4231EEBC8">
"On farther examination and application of the above hypothe&s;is, it will I believe extend through all nature. A broad countenance is accompanied by a &s;hort neck, broad &s;houlders and back, and their known character is &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and obtu&s;e &s;en|&s;ation. The long, &s;mall countenance, has a long neck, &s;mall, or low &s;houlders and &s;mall back. From &s;uch I &s;hould expect more ju&s;tice, di&s;intere&s;t|edne&s;s, and a general &s;uperiority of &s;ocial feelings.</P>
<P>"The features and character of men are e&s;&s;en|tially altered by education, &s;ituation, intercour&s;e, and incidents; therefore we are ju&s;tified in main|taining, that phy&s;iognomy cannot look back to the origin of the features, nor pre&s;age the changes of futurity; but from the countenance only, ab&s;tract|ed from all external accidents by which it may be affected, it may read what any given man may be, with the following addition at mo&s;t: &s;uch &s;hall be the empire of rea&s;on, or &s;uch the power of &s;en&s;u|ality. This man is too &s;tubborn to be in&s;tructed; that &s;o flexible he may be led to good or ill.</P>
<P>"From this formation we may in part explain why &s;o many men appear to be born for certain &s;ituations, although they may have rather been placed in them by accident than by choice. Why the prince, the nobleman, the over&s;eer of the poor, have a lordly, a &s;tern, or a pedantic manner; why the &s;ubject, the &s;ervant, the &s;lave, are pu&s;illanimous and &s;piritle&s;s; or the courtezan affected, con&s;train|ed, or in&s;ipid. The con&s;tant influence of circum|&s;tances on the mind, far exceeds the influence of nature." Far the contrary.</P>
<P>"Although it is certain, that <HI>innate</HI> &s;ervility is&punc; very di&s;tinct from the &s;ervility of o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> whom mi&s;|fortune has rendered a &s;ervant; like as he whom chance has made a ruler over his brother, is very different from one who is by nature &s;uperior to vulgar &s;ouls."</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="027203_0206_0FD3D41A1B699FB8">
There is no &s;uch thing as <HI>innate</HI> &s;ervility. It is true that, under certain circum&s;tances, &s;ome are much more di&s;po&s;ed than others to become &s;ervile.</P>
<P>"The unfeeling mind of the &s;lave has vacuity more complete, or, if a ma&s;ter, more &s;elf-compla|cency and arrogance, in the open mouth, the pro|jecting lip, and the turned-up no&s;e. The noble mind rules by the comprehen&s;ive re&s;pect, while, in the clo&s;ed lips, moderation is expre&s;&s;ed. He will &s;erve with &s;ullenne&s;s, with downca&s;t eye, and his &s;hut mouth will di&s;dain to complain.</P>
<P>"As the foregoing cau&s;es will make durable im|pre&s;&s;ions, &s;o will the adventitious occa&s;ion tran&s;i|tory ones, while their power remains. The latter are more apparent than the &s;igns of the counte|nance at re&s;t, but may be well defined by the princi|pal characteri&s;tics of the agitated features; and, by compari&s;on with countenances &s;ubject to &s;imilar agitations, the nature of the mind may be fully di&s;|played. Anger in the unrea&s;onable ridiculou&s;ly &s;truggles; in the &s;elf-conceited it is fearful rage; in the noble minded, it yields and brings opponents to &s;hame; in the benevolent, it has a mixture of compa&s;&s;ion for the offender, moving him to re|pentance.</P>
<P>"The affliction of the ignorant is outrageous, and of the vain ridiculous; of the compa&s;&s;ionate, abundant in tears and communicative; of the re&s;o|lute, &s;erious, internal, the mu&s;cles of the cheeks &s;carcely drawn upwards, the forehead little wrink|led.</P>
<P>"The love of the ignorant is violent and eager; of the vain, di&s;gu&s;ting, which is &s;een in the &s;park|ling eyes, and the forced &s;mile of the forked cheeks, and the indrawn mouth&punc; of the tender, langui&s;h|ing, with the mouth contracted to intr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">t; of the man of &s;en&s;e, &s;erious, &s;tedfa&s;tly &s;urveying the ob|ject, the forehead open, and the mouth prepared to plead.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="027203_0207_0FD3D41F881B41A0">
"On the whole, the &s;en&s;ations of a man of for|titude are re&s;trained, while tho&s;e of the ignorant degenerate into grimace. The latter, therefore, are not the proper &s;tudy of the arti&s;t, though they are of the phy&s;iognomi&s;t, and the moral teacher, that youth may be warned again&s;t too &s;trong an ex|pre&s;&s;ion of the emotions of the mind, and of their ridiculous effects.</P>
<P>"Thus do the communicative and moving &s;en|&s;ations of the benevolent in&s;pire reverence; but tho&s;e of the vicious, fear, hatred, or contempt.</P>
<P>"The repetition of pa&s;&s;ions engrave their &s;igns &s;o deeply, that they re&s;emble the original &s;tamp of nature. Hence certainly may be deduced, that the mind is addicted to &s;uch pa&s;&s;ions. Thus are poetry and the dramatic art highly beneficial, and thus may be &s;een the advantage of conducting youth to &s;cenes of mi&s;ery and of death.</P>
<P>"Frequent intercour&s;e forms &s;uch a &s;imilarity between men, that they not only a&s;&s;ume a mental likene&s;s, but frequently contract &s;ome re&s;emblance of voice and features. Of this I know &s;everal ex|amples.</P>

<P>"This idea, which is more difficult to execute than conceive, was in&s;pired by the various tones in which I have heard <HI>yes</HI> and <HI>no</HI> pronounced. The various emotions under which the&s;e words are ut|tered, whether of a&s;&s;urance, deci&s;ion, joy, grief,

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Extracts from Ari&s;totle and other Authors on Bea&s;ts.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<DIV3 TYPE="extracts">
<P>WHAT Ari&s;totle has written on phy&s;iognomy appears to me very &s;uperficial, u&s;ele&s;s, and often &s;elf-contradictory, e&s;pecially his general rea|&s;oning. Still, however, we &s;ometimes meet an oc|ca&s;ional thought which de&s;erves to be &s;elected. The following are &s;ome of the&s;e:</P>
<P>"A mon&s;ter has never been &s;een which had the form of another creature, and, at the &s;ame time, totally different powers of thinking and acting&punc; Thus for example, the groom judges from the mer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> appearance of the hor&s;e; the hunt&s;man, from the appearance of the hound. We find no man entirely like a bea&s;t, although there are &s;ome features in man which remind us of bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>"If any one would endeavour to di&s;cover the &s;igns of bravery in man, he would act wi&s;ely to col|lect all the &s;igns of bravery in animated nature, by which courageous animals are di&s;tingui&s;hed from others. The phy&s;iognomi&s;t &s;hould then examine all &s;uch animated beings, which are the rever&s;e of the former, with re&s;pect to internal character, and, from the compari&s;on of the&s;e oppo&s;ites, the expre&s;|&s;ions or &s;igns of courage would be manife&s;t.</P>
<P>"As weak hair betokens of fear, &s;o does &s;trong hair courage. This ob&s;ervation is applicable not only to men but to bea&s;ts. The mo&s;t fearful of bea&s;ts are the deer, the hare, and the &s;heep, and the hair of the&s;e is weaker than that of other bea&s;ts. The lion and wild boar, on the contrary, are the mo&s;t courageous, which property is con&s;picuous in their extremely &s;trong hair. The &s;ame al&s;o
<PB N="204" REF="027203_0214_0FD3D3D90D147708">
may be remarked of birds; for, in general, tho&s;e among them which have coar&s;e feathers are coura|geous, and tho&s;e that have &s;oft and weak feathers are fearful. This may ea&s;ily be applied to men. The people of the north are generally courageous, and have &s;trong hair; while tho&s;e of the we&s;t are more fearful, and have more flexible hair.</P>
<P>"Such bea&s;ts as are remarkable for their cou|rage, &s;imply give their voices vent, without any great con&s;traint, while fearful bea&s;ts utter vehement &s;ounds. Compare the lion, ox, the barking-dog, and cock, which are courageous to the deer and the hare. The lion appears to have a more ma&s;culine character, than any other bea&s;t. He has a large mouth, a four-cornered not too bony vi&s;age. The upper jaw does not project, but exactly fits the un|der; the no&s;e is rather hard than &s;oft, the eyes are neither &s;unken nor prominent, the forehead is &s;quare, and &s;ometimes flattened in the middle.</P>
<P>"Tho&s;e who have thick and firm lips, with the upper hung over the under, are &s;imple per&s;ons, ac|cording to the analogy of the ape and monkey."</P>
<P>This is mo&s;t indeterminately &s;poken. He would have been much more accurate had he &s;aid, tho&s;e who&s;e under lips are weak, extended, and project|ing, beyond the upper, are &s;imple people.</P>
<P>"Tho&s;e who have the tip of the no&s;e hard and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">irm, love to employ them&s;elves on &s;ubjects that give them little trouble, &s;imilar to the cow and the ox."</P>
<P>In&s;upportable! The few men, who have the tip of the no&s;e firm, are the mo&s;t wearied in their re|&s;earches. I &s;hall tran&s;cribe no farther. His phy|&s;iognomonical remarks, and his &s;imilarities to bea&s;ts, are generally unfounded in experience.</P>
<P>Porta, next to Ari&s;totle, has mo&s;t ob&s;erved the re&s;emblance between the countenances of men and bea&s;ts, and has extended this inquiry the farthe&s;t. He, as far as I know, was the fir&s;t to render this
<PB N="205" REF="027203_0215_0FD3D441FAC50F28">
&s;imilarity apparent, by placing the countenances of men and bea&s;ts be&s;ide each other. Nothing can be more true than this fact; and, while we conti|nue to follow nature, and do not endeavour to make &s;uch &s;imilarities greater than they are, it is a &s;ubject that cannot be too accurately examined. But, in this re&s;pect, the fanciful Porta appears to me to have been often mi&s;led, and to have found re|&s;emblances which the eye of truth never could di&s;|cover. I could di&s;cover no re&s;emblance between the hound and Plato, at lea&s;t from which cool rea|&s;on could draw any conclu&s;ions. It is &s;ingular enough, that he has al&s;o compared the heads of men and birds. He might more effectually have examined the exce&s;&s;ive di&s;&s;imilarity, than the very &s;mall and almo&s;t imperceptible re&s;emblance which can exi&s;t. He &s;peaks little concerning the hor&s;e, elephant, and monkey&punc; though it is certain that the&s;e animals have mo&s;t re&s;emblance to man.</P>
<P>A generic difference between man and bea&s;t is particularly con&s;picuous in the &s;tructure of the bones. The head of man is placed erect on the &s;pinal bone. His whole form is as the foundation pillar for that arch in which heaven &s;hould be re|flected, &s;upporting that &s;cull by which, like the fir|mament it is encircled. This cavity for the brain con&s;titutes the greater part of the head. All our &s;en&s;ations, as I may &s;ay, a&s;cend and de&s;cend above the jaw-bone, and collect them&s;elves upon the lips. How do the eyes, that mo&s;t eloquent of organs, &s;tand in need, if not of words, at lea&s;t of the angry con&s;traint of the cheeks, and all the intervening &s;hades, to expre&s;s, or rather to &s;tammer, the &s;trong internal &s;en&s;ations of man.</P>
<P>How directly the rever&s;e of this is the formation of bea&s;ts! The head is only attached to the &s;pine. The brain, the extremity of the &s;pinal marrow, has no greater extent than is nece&s;&s;ary for animal life,
<PB N="206" REF="027203_0216_0FD3D42B74084448">
and the conducting of a creature wholly &s;en&s;ual, and formed but for temporary exi&s;tence. For although we cannot deny, that bea&s;ts have the fa|culty of memory, and act from reflexion, yet the former, as I may &s;ay, is the effect of primary &s;en&s;a|tion, and the latter originates in the con&s;traint of the moment, and the preponderance of this or that object.</P>
<P>In the difference of the &s;cull which defines the character of animals, we may perceive, in the mo&s;t convincing manner, how the bones determine the form, and denote the properties of the creature.</P>
<P>As the characters of animals are di&s;tinct, &s;o are their forms, bones, and outlines. From the &s;mall|e&s;t winged in&s;ect to the eagle that &s;oars and gazes at the &s;un; from the weake&s;t worm, impotently crawling beneath our feet, to the elephant, or the maje&s;tic lion, the gradations of phy&s;iognomonical expre&s;&s;ion cannot be mi&s;taken. It would be more than ridiculous to expect from the worm, the but|terfly, and the lamb, the power of the rattle&s;nake, the eagle, and the lion. Were the lion and lamb, for the fir&s;t time, placed before us, had we never known &s;uch animals, never heard their names, &s;till we could not re&s;i&s;t the impre&s;&s;ion of the courage and &s;trength of the one, or of the weakne&s;s and &s;uf|ferance of the other.</P>
<P>Let me a&s;k the que&s;tion, which are, in general, the weake&s;t animals, and the mo&s;t remote from hu|manity, the mo&s;t incapable of human ideas and &s;en|&s;ations? Beyond all doubt, tho&s;e which in their form lea&s;t re&s;emble man. To prove this, let us, in imagination, con&s;ider the various degrees of animal life, from the &s;malle&s;t animalcula to the ape, lion, and elephant; and the more to &s;implify, and give facility to &s;uch compari&s;on, let us only compare head to head; as for example, the lob&s;ter to the elephant, the elephant to the man.</P>

would &s;uch a work be of the united abilities of a Buffon, a Camper, and a Euler, could they be found united, that the forms of heads might be enumerated and de&s;cribed, philo&s;ophically and ma|thematically; that it might be demon&s;trated, that univer&s;al brutality&punc; in all its various kinds, is cir|cum&s;cribed by a determinate line; and that, among the innumerable lines of brutality, there is not one which is not internally and e&s;&s;entially different from the line of humanity, which is peculiar and unique.</P>

<HEAD>Thoughts of a Friend on brutal and human Phy&s;iog|nomy.</HEAD>
<P>"Each brute animal has &s;ome principal quality by which it is di&s;tingui&s;hed from all others. As the make of each is di&s;tinct from all others, &s;o al&s;o is the character. This principal character is deno|ted by a peculiar and vi&s;ible form. Each &s;pecies of bea&s;t has certainly a peculiar character, as it has a peculiar form. May we not hence, by analogy, in|fer, that predominant qualities of the mind are as certainly expre&s;&s;ed by predominant forms of the body&punc; as that the peculiar qualities of a &s;pecies are expre&s;&s;ed in the general form of that &s;pecies?</P>
<P>"The principal character of the &s;pecies in ani|mals remains &s;uch as it was given by nature; it neither can be ob&s;cured by acce&s;&s;ory qualities, nor concealed by art. The e&s;&s;ential of the character can as little be changed a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the peculiarity of the form. May we not therefore, with the greate&s;t de|gree of certainty, affirm &s;uch a form is only expre&s;|&s;ive of &s;uch a character?</P>
<P>"Let us now inquire whether this be applicable to man, and whether the form, which denotes indi|vidual character in a bea&s;t is &s;ignificant of &s;imilar character in man, granting that, in man, it may continually be more delicate, hidden, and compli|cated.
<PB N="208" REF="027203_0218_0FD3D42A037350E8">
If, on examination, this que&s;tion be defi|nitely an&s;wered in the affirmative, how much is thereby gained! But it is con&s;picuou&s;ly evident that, in man, the mind is not one character or qua|lity, but a world of qualities interwoven with and ob&s;curing each other. If each quality be expre&s;&s;ed by its peculiar form, then mu&s;t variety of qualities be attended with variety of forms; and the&s;e forms, combining and harmonizing together, mu&s;t be|come more difficult to &s;elect and decypher.</P>
<P>"May not &s;ouls differ from each other merely according to their relative connexion with bodies? May not &s;ouls al&s;o have a determinate capacity, proportionate to the form and organization of the body? Hence each object may make a different impre&s;&s;ion on each individual; hence one may bear greater burthens and more misfortunes than ano|ther. May not the body be con&s;idered as a ve&s;&s;el with various compartments, cavities, pipes, into which the &s;oul is poured, and in con&s;equence of which motion and &s;en&s;ation begin to act? And thus may not the form of the body define the capa|city of the mind?"</P>
<P>Thus far my unknown friend.&mdash;Figurative lan|guage is dangerous when di&s;cour&s;ing on the &s;oul; yet how can we di&s;cour&s;e on it otherwi&s;e? I pro|nounce no judgment, but rely on &s;en&s;ation and ex|perience, not on words and metaphors. What is, is, be your language what it will. Whether effects all act from the external to the internal, or the re|ver&s;e, I know not, cannot, need not know. Expe|rience convinces us that, both in man and bea&s;t, power and form are in an unchangeable, harmoni|zed proportion; but whether the form be deter|mined by the power, or the power by the form, is a que&s;tion wholly in&s;ignificant to the phy&s;iognomi&s;t.</P>

The profile of the lion is remarkable, e&s;pecially the outline of the forehead and no&s;e. A man, who&s;e profile of forehead and no&s;e &s;hould re&s;emble that of the lion, would certainly be no common man, but &s;uch I have never &s;een. I own, the no&s;e of the lion is much le&s;s prominent than that of man, but much more than that of any other qua|druped. Royal, brutal &s;trength, and arrogant u&s;ur|pation are evident, partly in the arching of the no&s;e, partly in its breadth and parallel lines, and e&s;pecial|ly in the almo&s;t right angle, which the outline of the eyelid forms with the &s;ide of the no&s;e.</P>

Little better in character, infe|rior in power. Unmerciful to birds and mice as the tyger to the lamb. They delight in prolonging tor|ture before they devour, and in this they exceed the tyger.</P>
<P>The more violent qualities of the elephant are di&s;coverable in the number and &s;ize of his bones; his intelligence in the roundne&s;s of his form; and his docility in the ma&s;&s;ine&s;s of his mu&s;cles; his art and di&s;cretion in the flexibility of his trunk; his retentive memory in the &s;ize and arching of his forehead, which approaches nearer to the outline of the human forehead than that of any other bea&s;t. Yet how e&s;&s;entially different is it from the human forehead, in the po&s;ition of the eye and mouth, &s;ince the latter generally makes nearly a right angle with the axis of the eye and the middle line of the mouth.</P>

<P>I am but little acquainted with hor&s;es, yet it &s;eems to me indubitable, that there is as great a difference in the phy&s;iognomy of hor&s;es as in that of men. The hor&s;e de&s;erves to be particularly con|&s;idered by the phy&s;iognomi&s;t, becau&s;e it is one of tho&s;e animals who&s;e phy&s;iognomy, at lea&s;t in pro|file, is &s;o much more prominent, &s;harp, and charac|teri&s;tic, than that o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> mo&s;t other bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>"Of all animals the hor&s;e is that, which to largene&s;s of &s;ize unites mo&s;t proportion and ele|gance in the parts of his body; for, comparing him to tho&s;e which are immediately above or below him, we &s;hall perceive that the a&s;s is ill made, the head of the lion is too large, the legs of the ox too &s;mall, the camel is deformed, and the rhinoceros and elephant too unwieldy. There is &s;carcely any bea&s;t has &s;o various, &s;o generally marking, &s;o &s;peak|ing a countenance, as a beautiful hor&s;e.</P>
<P>"In a well made hor&s;e, the upper part of the neck, from which the mane flows, ought to ri&s;e at fir&s;t in a right line; and, as it approaches the head, to form a curve &s;omewhat &s;imilar to the neck of the &s;wan. The lower part of the neck ought to be rectilinear, in its direction from the che&s;t to the nether jaw, but a little inclined forward; for, were it perpendicular, the &s;hape of the neck would be defective. The upper part of the neck &s;hould be thin and not fle&s;hy; nor the mane, which ought to be tolerably full, and the hair long and &s;traight. A fine neck ought to be long and elevated, yet pro|portionate to the &s;ize of the hor&s;e. If too long and &s;mall, the hor&s;e would &s;trike the rider with his head; if too &s;hort and fle&s;hy, he would bear heavy on the hand. The head is advantageou&s;ly placed when the forehead is perpendicular to the horizon.
<PB N="212" REF="027203_0222_0FD3D3CE77FF3868">
The head ought to be bony and &s;mall, not too long; the ears near each other, &s;mall, erect, firm, &s;traight, free, and &s;ituated on the top of the head. The forehead &s;hould be narrow and &s;omewhat convex, the hollows filled up; the eyelids thin; the eyes clear, penetrating, full of ardour, tolerably large, as I may &s;ay, and projecting from the head; the pu|pil large, the under jaw bony, and rather thick; the no&s;e &s;omewhat arched, the no&s;trils open, and well &s;lit, the partition thin; the lips fine, the mouth tolerably large, the withers high and &s;harp.

<P>The more accurately we ob&s;erve hor&s;es, the more &s;hall we be convinced, that a &s;eparate treati&s;e of phy&s;iognomy might be written on them. I have &s;omewhere heard a general remark, that hor&s;es are divided into three cla&s;&s;es, the &s;wan-necked, the &s;tag-necked and the hog-necked. Each of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es has its peculiar countenance and character, and from the blending of which various others origi|nate.</P>
<P>The heads of &s;wan-necked hor&s;es are commonly even, the forehead &s;mall, and almo&s;t flat; the no&s;e extends, arching from the eyes to the mouth; the no&s;trils are wide and open; the mouth &s;mall; the ears little, pointed, and projecting; the eyes large and round; the jaw below, &s;mall; above, &s;omething broader; the whole body well proportioned, and the hor&s;e beautiful. This kind is cheerful, tracta|ble, and high &s;pirited. They are very &s;en&s;ible of pain, which, when dre&s;&s;ing, they &s;ometimes expre&s;s by the voice. Flattery greatly excites their joy, and they will expre&s;s their pride of heart by parading and prancing. I will venture to a&s;&s;ert, that a man with a &s;wan-neck, or what is much more determin|ate,
<PB N="213" REF="027203_0223_0FD3D3CFF9069A30">
with a &s;mooth, projecting profile, and flaxen hair, would have &s;imilar &s;en&s;ibility and pride.</P>
<P>The &s;tag-necked has &s;omething, in the make of his body, much re&s;embling the &s;tag it&s;elf. The neck is &s;mall, large, and &s;carely bowed in the mid|dle. He carries his head high. I have &s;een none of the&s;e. They are racers and hunters, being par|ticularly adapted for &s;wiftne&s;s by the make of the body.</P>
<P>The hog-necked. The neck above and below is alike broad; the head hanging downwards; the middle of the no&s;e is concave, in profile; the ears are long, thick, and hanging; the eyes &s;mall and ugly; the no&s;trils &s;mall, the mouth large, the whole body round, and the coat long and rough. The&s;e hor&s;es are intractable, &s;low, and vicious; and will run the rider again&s;t a wall, &s;tone, or tree. When held in, they rear, and endeavour to throw the ri|der. Blows or coaxing are frequently alike inef|fectual, they continue ob&s;tinate and re&s;tif.</P>
<P>If we examine the different heads of hor&s;es, we &s;hall find, that all cheerful, high-&s;pirited, caprici|ous, courageous hor&s;es, have the no&s;e-bone of the profile convex; and that mo&s;t of the vicious, re&s;tif, and idle, have the &s;ame bone flat or concave. In the eyes, mouth, and e&s;pecially in the no&s;trils and jaw-bones, are remarkable varieties, concerning which I &s;hall &s;ay nothing. I &s;hall here add &s;ome remarks on the hor&s;e, communicated by a friend.</P>
<P>The grey is the tendere&s;t of hor&s;es, and we may here add, that people with light hair, if not effemi|nate, are yet, it is well known, of tender formation and con&s;titution. The che&s;nut and iron-grey, the black, and bay, are hardy; the &s;orrel are the mo&s;t hardy, and yet the mo&s;t &s;ubject to di&s;ea&s;e. The &s;orrel, whether well or ill-formed, is treacherous. All treacherous hor&s;es lay their ears in the neck. They &s;tare and &s;top, and lay down their ears alter|nately.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="027203_0224_0FD3D3BDF262CDC0">
The following pa&s;&s;age, on the &s;ame &s;ubject, is cited from another writer: "When a hor&s;e has broad, long, widely &s;eparated, hanging ears, we are well a&s;&s;ured he is bad and &s;luggi&s;h. If he lays down his ears alternately, he is fearful, and apt to &s;tart. Thin, pointed, and projecting ears, on the contrary, denote a hor&s;e of good di&s;po&s;ition."</P>
<P>We never find that the thick, hog-necked hor&s;e is &s;ufficiently tractable for the riding-hou&s;e, or that he is of a &s;trong nature when the tail &s;hakes, like the tail of a dog. We may be certain, that a hor&s;e with large cheerful eyes, and a fine &s;hining coat, if we have no other tokens, is of a good con&s;titution and under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>The&s;e remarks are equally applicable to oxen and &s;heep, and probably to all other animals. The white ox is not &s;o long &s;erviceable, for draught or labour, as the black or red: he is more weak or &s;ickly than the&s;e. A &s;heep with &s;hort legs, &s;trong neck, broad back, and cheerful eyes, is a good breeder, and remains peaceably with the flock. And I am of opinion, that if we may judge of the internal by the external of bea&s;ts, men may be judg|ed of in the &s;ame manner.</P>

<HEAD>Birds.</HEAD>
<P>BIRDS, whether compared to each other, or to other creatures, have their di&s;tinct characters. The &s;tructure of birds throughout, is lighter than that of quadrupeds. Nature, ever &s;tedfa&s;t to truth,
<PB N="215" REF="027203_0225_0FD3D3DBF3C0FE30">
thus manife&s;ts her&s;elf in the form of birds. Their necks are more pliant, their heads &s;maller, their mouths more pointed, and their garb more bright and &s;hining than tho&s;e of quadrupeds.</P>
<P>Their di&s;tinction of character, or gradation of pa&s;&s;ive and active power, is expre&s;&s;ed by the follow|ing phy&s;iognomonical varieties:</P>
<P N="1">1. By the form of the &s;cull. The more flat the &s;cull, the more weak, flexible, tender, and &s;en&s;ible is the character of the animal. This flatne&s;s con|tains le&s;s, and re&s;i&s;ts le&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. By the length, breadth, and arching, or obli|quity of their beaks; and here again we find, when there is arching, there is a greater extent of docili|ty and capacity.</P>
<P N="3">3. By the eyes which appear to have an exact corre&s;pondence with the arching of the beak.</P>
<P N="4">4. Particularly by the middle line, I cannot &s;ay of the mouth, but what is analagous to the mouth, the beak; the obliquity of which is ever in a re|markable proportion with the outline of the profile of the head.</P>
<P>Who can behold the eagle hovering in the air, the powerful lord of &s;o many creatures, without perceiving the &s;eal, the native &s;tar of royalty in his piercing round eye, the form of his head, his &s;trong wings, his talons of bra&s;s, and, in his whole form, his victorious &s;trength, his contemptuous arrogance, his fearful cruelty, and his ravenous propen&s;ity?</P>
<P>Con&s;ider the eyes of all living creatures from the eagle to the mole; where el&s;e can be found that lightning glance, which defies the rays of the &s;un? Where that capacity for the reception of light? How truly, emphatically, to all who will hear and under&s;tand, is the maje&s;ty of his kingly character vi&s;ible, not alone in his burning eye, but in the out|line of what is analagous to the eyebone, and in the &s;kin of the head, where anger and courage are &s;eated? But, throughout his whole form, where are they not?</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>On Shades.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THOUGH &s;hades are the weake&s;t and mo&s;t va|pid, yet they are at the &s;ame time, when the light is at a proper di&s;tance, and falls properly on the countenance to take the profile accurately, the true&s;t repre&s;entation that can be given of man. The weake&s;t, for it is not po&s;itive, it is only &s;ome|thing negative, only the boundary line of half the countenance. The true&s;t, becau&s;e it is the imme|diate expre&s;&s;ion of nature, &s;uch as not the able&s;t painter is capable of drawing by hand after nature. What can be le&s;s the image of a living man than a &s;hade? Yet how full of &s;peech! Little gold, but the pure&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;hade contains but one line; no motion, light, colour, height, or depth; no eye, ear, no&s;tril, or cheek; but a very &s;mall part of the lip; yet how deci&s;ively it is &s;ignificant! Drawing and painting, it is probable, originated in &s;hades. They expre&s;s, as I have &s;aid, but little, but the little they do ex|pre&s;s is exact. No art can attain to the truth of the
<PB N="219" REF="027203_0229_0FD3D401EE8ACF68">
&s;hade taken with preci&s;ion. Let a &s;hade be taken after nature with the greate&s;t accuracy, and with equal accuracy be afterwards reduced upon fine tran&s;parent oil paper. Let a profile, of the &s;ame &s;ize, be taken, by the greate&s;t ma&s;ter, in his hap|pie&s;t moment; then let the two be laid upon each other, and the difference will be immediately evi|dent.</P>
<P>I never found, after repeated experiments, that the be&s;t efforts of art could equal nature, either in freedom or in preci&s;ion, but that there was always &s;omething more or le&s;s than nature. Nature is &s;harp and free: whoever &s;tudies &s;harpne&s;s more than freedom will be hard, and who&s;oever &s;tudies free|dom more than &s;harpne&s;s will become diffu&s;e and indeterminate. I can admire him only, who, equally &s;tudious of her &s;harpne&s;s and freedom, acquires equal certainty and impartiality.</P>
<P>To attain this, arti&s;t, imitator of humanity! fir&s;t exerci&s;e your&s;elf in drawing &s;hades; after|wards copy them by hand, and next compare and correct. Without this you will with difficulty di&s;|cover the grand &s;ecret of uniting preci&s;ion and freedom.</P>
<P>I have collected more phy&s;iognomonical know|ledge from &s;hades alone than from every other kind of portrait; have improved phy&s;iognomonical &s;en&s;a|tion more by the &s;ight of them than by the contem|plation of ever mutable nature. Shades collect the di&s;tracted attention, confine it to an outline, and thus render the ob&s;ervation more &s;imple, ea&s;y, and preci&s;e. Phy&s;iognomy has no greater, more incon|trovertable certainty of the truth of its object than that imparted by &s;hade. If the &s;hade, according to the general &s;en&s;e and deci&s;ion of all men, can decide &s;o much concerning character, how much more mu&s;t the living body, the whole appearance, and action of the man! If the &s;hade be oracular, the voice
<PB N="220" REF="027203_0230_0FD3D3FCF41F3748">
of truth, the word of God, what mu&s;t the living original be illuminated by the &s;pirit of God!</P>
<P>Hundreds have a&s;ked, and hundreds will conti|nue to a&s;k, "What can be expected from mere &s;hades?" Yet no &s;hade can be viewed by any one of the&s;e hundred, who will not form &s;ome judg|ment on it, often accurately, more accurately than I could have judged.</P>
<P>In order to make the a&s;toni&s;hing &s;ignificance of &s;hades con&s;picuous, we ought either to compare op|po&s;ite characters of men taken in &s;hade, or, which may be more convincing, to cut out of black paper, or draw, imaginary countenances widely di&s;&s;imilar. Or, again, when we have acquired &s;ome proficiency in ob&s;ervation&punc; to double black paper, and cut two countenances; and, afterwards, by cutting with the &s;ci&s;&s;ars, to make &s;light alterations, appealing to our eye, or phy&s;iognomonical feeling, at each alterati|on; or, la&s;tly, only to take various &s;hades of the &s;ame countenance, and compare them together. Such experiments would a&s;toni&s;h us, to perceive what great effects are produced by &s;light altera|ons.</P>
<P>The common method of taking &s;hades is accom|panied with many inconveniences. It is hardly po&s;&s;ible the per&s;on drawn &s;hould &s;it &s;ufficiently &s;till; the de&s;igner is obliged to change his place, he mu&s;t approach &s;o near to the per&s;on that motion is almo&s;t inevitable, and the de&s;igner is in the mo&s;t inconvenient po&s;ition; neither are the preparatory &s;teps every where po&s;&s;ible, nor &s;imple enough. A &s;eat purpo&s;ely contrived would be more convenient. The &s;hade &s;hould be taken on po&s;t paper, or rather on thin oiled paper, well dried. Let the head and back be &s;upported by a chair and the &s;hade fall on the oil-paper behind a clear flat poli&s;hed gla&s;s. Let the drawer &s;it behind the gla&s;s, holding the frame with his left hand, and, having a &s;harp black lead pencil, draw with the right. The gla&s;s, in a de|tached

<P>THERE appear to me to be the three things in|di&s;pen&s;able to travellers, health, money, and phy&s;iognomy. Therefore, a phy&s;iognomonical word to travellers. I could wi&s;h, indeed, that, in|&s;tead of a word, <HI>a traveller's phy&s;iognomonical companion</HI> were written; but this mu&s;t be done by an expe|rienced traveller. In the mean time I &s;hall bid him farewel, with the following &s;hort advice:</P>
<P>What do you &s;eek, travellers? What is your wi&s;h? What would you &s;ee more remarkable, more

&s;ingular, more rare, more worthy to be examined, than the varieties of humanity? This indeed is fa&s;hionable. You inquire after men; you &s;eek the wi&s;e&s;t, be&s;t, and greate&s;t men, e&s;pecially the mo&s;t famous. Why is your curio&s;ity limited to &s;eeing only? Would it not be better you &s;hould illuminate your own minds by the light of others, and animate your&s;elves by their ardour?</P>
<P>His curio&s;ity is childi&s;h, which is merely confined to &s;eeing, who&s;e ambition de&s;ires only to &s;ay, I have beheld that man. He who would di&s;regard views &s;o confined, mu&s;t &s;tudy &s;uch men phy&s;iognomoni|cally; if he would learn wi&s;dom, he mu&s;t be able to compare and judge of the relation between their works, their fame and their form. By this only may much be learned. By this may the &s;tream be compared to the fountain, the quality of the wa|ters examined, their cour&s;e, their gentle murmurs, or more boi&s;terous war. The inquirer may a&s;k, what is the degree of originality of tho&s;e men, what is borrowed, what is internal, what external? This forehead, and the&s;e eyebrows, will thus ver&s;ify, thus tran&s;late, thus critici&s;e; therefore, on this eye de|pends the fate of the writer, the blockhead, or the man of genius. This no&s;e thus e&s;timates the mor|tal and the immortal, in human performances. As are the features, &s;o will be the mind.</P>
<P>Yes, &s;cholars of nature, you have much to learn from the countenances of famous men. In them you will read, that the wa&s;p will dare to alight on the no&s;e of the hero. To <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it will be plea&s;ure when you have acquired this phy&s;iognomonical &s;en|&s;ation; for, without this, you will but travel in the dark; you will but be led through a picture-galle|ry blindfold, only that you might &s;ay, I too have been in that gallery.</P>

I would fir&s;t con&s;ider the general form of the inhabitants, their height, proportion, &s;trength, weakne&s;s, motion, complexion, attitude, ge&s;ture, and gait. I would ob&s;erve them individually, &s;ee, compare, clo&s;e my eyes, trace in imagination all I had &s;een, open them again, correct my memory, and clo&s;e and open them alternately. I would &s;tu|dy for words, write, and draw with a few determi|nate traits, the general form, &s;o ea&s;y to be di&s;co|vered. I would compare my drawings with the known general form of the people. How ea&s;ily might a &s;ummary, an index of the people be ob|tained.</P>
<P>Having made the&s;e familiar to me, I would de|&s;cend to the particular, would &s;earch for the gene|ral form of the head, would a&s;k, Is it mo&s;t confined to the cylindrical, the &s;pherical, the &s;quare, the convex, or the concave? Is the countenance open, is it writhed, is it free, or forked? I would next examine the forehead, then the eyebrows, the out|line and colour of the eyes, the no&s;e, and e&s;pecially the mouth when it is open; and the teeth, with their appearances, to di&s;cover the national charac|teri&s;tic.</P>
<P>Could I but define the line of the opening of the lips, in &s;even promi&s;cuous countenances, I imagine I &s;hould have found the general phy&s;iognomonical character of the nation or place. I almo&s;t dare to

<P>I next would plant my&s;elf in a public walk, or at the cro&s;&s;ing of &s;treets.

By the wrinkle&s;s, compre&s;&s;ed, yet open forehead, the pow|erful eyebrows; the ea&s;ily di&s;cerned, ea&s;ily delinea|ted &s;pace between the eyebrows, which extends it|&s;elf to the back of the no&s;e, like the great &s;treet from the market-place to the chief gate of a city. By the &s;hut but freely breathing mouth; the chin, neither haggard nor fle&s;hy; the deep and &s;hining attraction of the eye; which all, uncautiou&s;ly and unintentionally betrayed them&s;elves to my re&s;earch: or, I di&s;covered him even in his foreign and di&s;tort|ed form, from which the arrogant, &s;elf-&s;uppo&s;ed hand&s;ome, would turn with contempt.

I approach the favourite of heaven.

"You have but few, but tho&s;e few are faithful." He &s;tands a&s;toni&s;hed, &s;miles or weeps, in the inno|cence and goodne&s;s of his heart, which he wi&s;hes to conceal, but which is open as day.

<P>A Word to Princes and Judges.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>FOR your u&s;e, mo&s;t important of men, how will|ingly would I write a treati&s;e. Who &s;o much as you need a perfect knowledge of man, free from cabal, or the intervention of &s;elf-intere&s;t! Suffer me to approach your throne, and pre&s;ent my pe|tition.</P>
<P>In your mo&s;t &s;ecret common place-book keep an index to each cla&s;s of character among men, taken from at lea&s;t ten of the mo&s;t accurate proofs; not at a di&s;tance, not among foreigners, but &s;eek at home for the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t of your own &s;ubjects. Wherever a wi&s;e and good prince governs, there are excellent &s;ubjects. Such a prince believes that he has &s;uch &s;ubjects, although at the moment he &s;hould be unacquainted with them; or at lea&s;t, that
<PB N="228" REF="027203_0239_0FD3D3FB709CE688">
he has &s;ubjects capable of wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s. Wherever one good per&s;on is, there certainly are two, as certainly as where the female is, there will the male be.</P>
<P>Suffer me, princes, con&s;ecrated as you are among men, to entreat you, for the honour of humanity, principally to &s;tudy, to &s;eek for, and to &s;eize on excellence. Judge not too &s;uddenly, nor by mere appearances. That which a prince once approves, it may afterwards be difficult or dangerous to reject. Depend not on the te&s;timony of others, which, to princes e&s;pecially, is ever exaggerated either in prai&s;e or blame; but examine the countenance, which, though it may di&s;&s;emble to a prince, or ra|ther to the dignity of a prince, cannot deceive him as a man. Having once di&s;covered wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s in a &s;ubject, honour &s;uch a &s;ubject as the be&s;t ble&s;&s;ing which heaven can, in this world, be|&s;tow upon its favourites. Seek features that are &s;trong, but not forbidding; gentle, yet not effemi|nate; po&s;itive, without turbulence; natural, not arrogant; with open eyes, clear a&s;pects, &s;trong no&s;es near the forehead, and with &s;uch let your thrones be &s;urrounded.</P>
<P>Entru&s;t your &s;ecrets to proportionate and parallel drawn countenances: to horizontal, firm, compre&s;&s;|ed eyebrows; channelled, not too rigorou&s;ly clo&s;ed, red, active, but not relaxed or withered lips. Yet I will forbear to delineate, and again only entreat, that the countenance may be &s;acred to you for the &s;ake of goodne&s;s and wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>And you, judges, judge not indeed by appearan|ances, but examine according to appearances, Ju&s;|tice blindfold without phy&s;iognomy is as unnatural as blindfold love. There are countenances which cannot have committed a multitude of vices. Stu|dy the traits of each vice, and the forms in which vice naturally or unwillingly re&s;ides. There are capabilities and incapabilities in the countenance,

things which it can will, others which it cannot. Each pa&s;&s;ion, open or concealed, has its peculiar language. The appearance of innocence is as de|terminate to the experienced eye as the appearance of health.</P>
<P>Bring guilt and innocence face to face, and exa|mine them; in your pre&s;ence, and when they &s;up|po&s;e you do not ob&s;erve them; in the pre&s;ence and in the ab&s;ence of witne&s;&s;es; with ju&s;tice &s;ee, with ju&s;tice hear and obey, the determined voice of un|prejudiced conviction.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>A Word to the Clergy.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>YOU al&s;o my brethren, need a certain degree of phy&s;iognomy, and perhaps, princes except|ed, no men more. You ought to know whom you have before you, that you may di&s;cern &s;pirits, and portion out the word of truth to each, according to his need and capacity. To whom can a know|ledge of the degree of actual and po&s;&s;ible virtue, in all who appear before you, be more advantageous than to you?</P>
<P>To me phy&s;iognomy is more indi&s;pen&s;able than the liturgy. It is to me alike profitable for doctrine, exhortation, comfort, correction, examination; with the healthy, with the &s;ick, the dying, the ma|lefactor; in judicial examinations, and the educa|tion of youth. Without it, I &s;hould be as the blind leading the blind.</P>
<P>A &s;ingle countenance might rob me of ardour or in&s;pire me with enthu&s;ia&s;m. Whenever I preach, I generally &s;eek the mo&s;t noble countenance, on which I endeavour to act, and the weake&s;t when teaching children. It is generally our own fault if our hearers are inattentive; if they do not them|&s;elves give the key, in which it is nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould be addre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Every teacher po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of phy&s;iognomonical &s;en|&s;ation, will ea&s;ily di&s;cern and arrange the principal cla&s;&s;es among his hearers, and what each cla&s;s can and cannot receive. Let &s;ix or &s;even cla&s;&s;es, of va|rious capacities, be &s;elected; let a chief, repre&s;en|tative, a characteri&s;tic countenance, of each cla&s;s be cho&s;en: let the&s;e countenances be fixed in the memory, and let the preacher accommodate him&s;elf to each; &s;peaking thus to one, and thus to ano|ther, and in &s;uch a manner to a third.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="027203_0242_0FD3D452DF46E988">
There cannot be a more natural, effective, or de|finite incitement to eloquence, than &s;uppo&s;ing &s;ome characteri&s;tic countenance pre&s;ent of the capacity of which almo&s;t mathematical certainty may be ob|tained.

<P><HI>A REGULAR well formed countenance,</HI> is where all the parts are remarkable for their &s;ymme|try.

<P><HI>A beautiful countenance</HI> is that in which, be&s;ides the proportion and po&s;ition of the parts, harmony, uniformity, and mind, are vi&s;ible; in which no|thing is &s;uperfluous, nothing deficient, nothing di&s;|proportionate, nothing &s;uperadded, but all is con|formity and concord.</P>
<P><HI>A plea&s;ant countenance</HI> does not nece&s;&s;arily require perfect &s;ymmetry and harmony, yet nothing mu&s;t be wanting, nothing burthen&s;ome. Its plea&s;antry will principally exi&s;t in the eye and lips, which mu&s;t have nothing commanding, arrogant, contemptu|ous, but mu&s;t generally &s;peak complacency, affabi|lity and benevolence.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="027203_0243_0FD3D44B09C7CCA8">
<HI>A gracious countenance</HI> ari&s;es out of the plea&s;ant, when, far from any thing a&s;&s;uming, to the milde&s;t benevolence are added affability and purity.</P>
<P><HI>A charming countenance</HI> mu&s;t not &s;imply con&s;i&s;t either of the beautiful, the plea&s;ant, or the graci|ous; but when to the&s;e is added a rapid propriety of motion, which renders it charming.</P>
<P><HI>An in&s;inuating countenance</HI> leaves no power to ac|tive or pa&s;&s;ive &s;u&s;picion. It has &s;omething more than the plea&s;ant, by infu&s;ing that into the heart, which the plea&s;ant only manife&s;ts.</P>
<P>Other &s;pecies of the&s;e delightful countenances are, the attracting, the winning, the irr&s;i&s;tible.</P>
<P>Very di&s;tinct from all the&s;e are the amu&s;ing, the divertingly loquacious, the merely mild, and al&s;o the tender and delicate.</P>
<P>Superior, and more lovely &s;till, is the purely in|nocent, where no di&s;torted, oblique mu&s;cle, whe|ther in motion, or at re&s;t, is ever &s;een.</P>
<P>This is &s;till more exalted, when it is full of &s;oul, of natural &s;ympathy and power to excite &s;ympathy.</P>
<P>When in a pure countenance good power is ac|companied by a &s;pirit of order, I may call it an at|tic countenance.</P>
<P><HI>Spiritually beautiful</HI> may be &s;aid of a countenance where nothing thoughtle&s;s, incon&s;iderate, rude, or &s;evere, is to be expected; and the a&s;pect of which immediately and mildly incites emotion in the prin|cipal powers of the mind.</P>
<P><HI>Noble</HI> is when we have not the lea&s;t indi&s;cretion to fear, and when the countenance is exalted above us, without a po&s;&s;ibility of envy, while it is le&s;s &s;en|&s;ible of its own &s;uperiority than of the plea&s;ure we receive in its pre&s;ence.</P>
<P><HI>A great countenance</HI> will have few &s;mall &s;econdary traits; will be in grand divi&s;ions, without wrinkles; mu&s;t exalt, mu&s;t affect us, in &s;leep, in plai&s;ter of Paris, in every kind of caricature; as, for example, that of Philip de Comines.</P>

<P><PB N="235" REF="027203_0246_0FD3D43004CF1FF8">
Let me al&s;o add to the hand&s;ome woman. The wi&s;e looks in the gla&s;s, and wa&s;hes away &s;pots; the fool looks, turns back, and remains as he was.</P>
<P N="2">2. "Each temperament, each character, has its good and bad. The one has inclinations of which the other is incapable. The one has more than the other. The ingot is of more worth than the gui|neas individually, into which it is coined; yet the latter are mo&s;t u&s;eful. The tulip delights by its beauty, the carnation by its &s;mell. The un&s;eemly wormwood di&s;plea&s;es both ta&s;te and &s;mell, yet, in medical virtue, is &s;uperior to both. There it is that each contributes to the perfection of the whole."</P>
<P>The carnation &s;hould not wi&s;h to be a tulip, the finger an eye, nor the weak de&s;ire to act within the circle of the &s;trong. Each has its peculiar circle, as it has its peculiar form. To wi&s;h to depart from this circle, is like wi&s;hing to be tran&s;ported into another body.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Upon Portrait Painting.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>PORTRAIT painting, is the mo&s;t natural, man|ly, u&s;eful, noble, and, however apparently ea&s;y, the mo&s;t difficult of arts. Love fir&s;t di&s;cov|ered this heavenly art. Without love what could it perform?</P>
<P>Since a great part of this pre&s;ent work, and the &s;cience on which it treats, depend on this art, it is proper that &s;omething &s;hould be &s;aid on the &s;ubject. Something; for how new, how important, and great a work might be written on this art! For the honour of man, and of the art, I hope &s;uch a work will be written. I do not think it ought to be the work of a painter, however great in his profe&s;&s;ion, but of the under&s;tanding friend of phy&s;iognomy, the man of ta&s;te, the daily confidential ob&s;erver of the great Portrait painter.</P>
<P>Sultzer, that philo&s;opher of ta&s;te and di&s;cernment, has an excellent article, in his dictionary, on this &s;ubject, under the word <HI>Portrait.</HI> But what can be &s;aid in a work &s;o confined, on a &s;ubject &s;o exten|&s;ive? Again, whoever will employ his thoughts on this art, will find that it is &s;ufficient to exerci&s;e all the &s;earching, all the active powers of man; that it never can be entirely learned, nor ever can arrive at ideal perfection.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now attempt to recapitulate &s;ome of the avoidable and unavoidable difficulties attendant on this art; the knowledge of which, in my opinion, is as nece&s;&s;ary to the painter as to the phy&s;iognomi&s;t.</P>
<P>Let us fir&s;t inquire, What is portrait painting? It is the communication, the pre&s;ervation of the image of &s;ome individual; the art of &s;uddenly de|picting all that can be depicted of that half of man,
<PB N="238" REF="027203_0249_0FD3D43B60B4D550">
which is rendered apparent, and which never can be conveyed in words. If what G&ouml;the has &s;ome|where &s;aid, be true, and in my opinion nothing can be more true, that the be&s;t text for a commenta|ry on man, is his pre&s;ence, his countenance, his form. How important then is the art of portrait painting&punc;</P>
<P>To this ob&s;ervation of G&ouml;the's, I will add a pa&s;|&s;age on the &s;ubject from Sultzer's excellent dictio|nary: "Since no object of knowledge whatever can be more important to us than a thinking and &s;eeling &s;oul, it cannot be denied but that man, con&s;i|dered according to his form, even though we &s;hould neglect what is wonderful in him, is the mo&s;t im|portant of vi&s;ible objects"</P>
<P>The portrait painter &s;hould know, feel, and be penetrated with this; penetrated with reverence for the greate&s;t work of the greate&s;t ma&s;ter. Were &s;uch the &s;ubject of his meditation, not from con|&s;traint, but native &s;en&s;ation; were it as natural to him as the love of life, how important, how &s;acred to him would his art become! Sacred to him &s;hould be the living countenance as the text of ho|ly &s;cripture to the tran&s;lator. As careful &s;hould the one be not to fal&s;ify the work, as &s;hould be the other not to fal&s;ify the word of God.</P>
<P>How great is the contempt which an excellent tran&s;lator of an excellent work de&s;erves, who&s;e mind is wholly inferior to the mind of his original. And is it not the &s;ame with the portrait painter? The countenance is the theatre on which the &s;oul exhibits it&s;elf: here mu&s;t its emanations be &s;tudied and caught. Whoever cannot &s;eize the&s;e emana|tions, cannot paint; and whoever cannot &s;eize the&s;e emana|tions, cannot paint; and whoever cannot paint the&s;e, is no portrait painter.</P>
<P>Each perfect portrait is an important painting, &s;ince it di&s;plays the human mind with the peculia|rities of per&s;onal character. In &s;uch we contem|plate a being where under&s;tanding, inclinations,
<PB N="239" REF="027203_0250_0FD3D3C123827828">
&s;en&s;ations, pa&s;&s;ions, good and bad qualities of mind and heart are mingled in a manner peculiar to it&s;elf. We here frequently &s;ee them better than in nature her&s;elf, &s;ince in nature nothing is fixed, all is &s;wift, all is tran&s;ient. In nature al&s;o we &s;eldom behold the features under that propitious a&s;pect in which they will be tran&s;mitted by the able painter.</P>
<P>Could we indeed &s;eize the &s;leeting tran&s;itions of nature, or had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he her moments of &s;tability, it would then be much more advantageous to con|template nature than her likene&s;s; but this being impo&s;&s;ible, and &s;ince likewi&s;e few people will &s;uffer them&s;elves to be ob&s;erved, &s;ufficiently to de&s;erve the name of ob&s;ervation, it is to me indi&s;putable, that a better knowledge of man may be obtained from portraits than from nature, &s;he being thus uncertain, thus fugitive.</P>
<P>Hence the rank of the portrait painter may ea&s;ily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e determined; he &s;tands next to the hi&s;torical painter. Nay hi&s;tory painting it&s;elf derives a part of its value from its portraits; for expre&s;&s;ion, one of the important requi&s;ites in hi&s;torical painting, will be the more e&s;timable, natural, and &s;trong, the more of actual phy&s;iognomy is expre&s;&s;ed in the countenances, and copied after nature. A collec|tion of excellent portraits is highly advantageous to the hi&s;torical painter for the &s;tudy of expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Where &s;hall we find the hi&s;torical painter, who can repre&s;ent real beings with all the decorations of fiction? Do we not &s;ee them all copying copies? True it is, they frequently copy from imagination; but this imagination is only &s;tored with the fa&s;hi|onable figures of their own or former times.</P>
<P>This premi&s;ed, let us now enumerate &s;ome of the &s;urmountable difficulties of portrait painting. I am con&s;cious the freedom with which I &s;hall &s;peak my thoughts will offend, yet to give offence is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> from my intention. I wi&s;h to aid, to teach that art, which is the imitation of the works of God: I wi&s;h
<PB N="240" REF="027203_0251_0FD3D43771AEF2C8">
improvement. And how is improvement po&s;&s;ible without a frank and undi&s;gui&s;ed di&s;covery of de|fects?</P>
<P>In all the works of portrait painters which I have &s;een, I have remarked the want of a more philo&s;o|phical, that is to &s;ay, a more ju&s;t, intelligible, and univer&s;al knowledge of men. The in&s;ect painter, who has no accurate knowledge of in&s;ects, the form, the general, the particular, which is appropriated to each in&s;ect, however good a copyi&s;t he may be, will certainly be a bad painter of in&s;ects. The por|trait painter, however excellent a copyi&s;t, (a thing much le&s;s general than is imagined by connoi&s;&s;eurs) will paint portraits ill, if he have not the mo&s;t ac|curate knowledge of the form, proportion, connex|ion, and dependance of the great and minute parts of the human body, as far as they have a remark|able influence on the &s;uperficies; if he has not mo&s;t accurately inve&s;tigated each individual member and feature. For my own part, be my knowledge what it may, it is far from accurate in what relates to the minute &s;pecific traits of each &s;en&s;ation, each member, each feature; yet I daily remark that this acute, this indi&s;pen&s;able knowledge, is at pre&s;ent every where uncultivated, unknown, and difficult to convey to the mo&s;t intelligent painters.</P>
<P>Whoever will be at the trouble of con&s;idering a number of men promi&s;cuou&s;ly taken, feature by fea|ture, will find that each ear, each mouth, not with|&s;tanding their infinite diver&s;ity, have yet their &s;mall curves, corners, characters, which are common to all, and which are found &s;tronger or weaker, more or le&s;s marking, in all men who are not mon&s;ters born, at lea&s;t in the&s;e parts.</P>
<P>Of what advantage is all our knowledge of the great proportions of the body and countenance? (Yet even that part of knowledge is, by far, not &s;ufficiently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, not &s;ufficiently accurate. Some future phy&s;iognomonical painter will ju&s;tify this a&s;|&s;ertion,
<PB N="241" REF="027203_0252_0FD3D431752721C8">
till when be it con&s;idered as nothing more than cavil.) Of what advantage, I &s;ay, is all our knowledge of the great proportions, when the knowledge of the finer traits, which are equally true, general, determinate, and no le&s;s &s;ignificant, is wanting? And this want is &s;o great, that I appeal to tho&s;e who are be&s;t informed, whether many of the able&s;t painters, who have painted numerous portraits, have any tolerably accurate or general theory of the mouth only. I do not mean the ana|tomical mouth, but the mouth of the painter, which he ought to &s;ee and may &s;ee, without any anatomi|cal knowledge.</P>
<P>I have examined volume after volume of engra|vings of portraits, after the greate&s;t ma&s;ters, and am therefore intitled to &s;peak. But let us confine ob&s;ervations to the mouth. Having previou&s;ly &s;tudied infants, boys, youth, manhood, old age, maidens, wives, matrons, with re&s;pect to the gene|ral properties of the mouth; and having di&s;cover|ed the&s;e, let us compare, and we &s;hall find that al|mo&s;t all painters have failed in the general theory of the mouth; that it &s;eldom happens, and &s;eems only to happen by accident, that any ma&s;ter has under&s;tood the&s;e general properties. Yet how in|de&s;cribably much depends on them! What is the particular, what the characteri&s;tic, but &s;hades of the general! As it is with the mouth, &s;o it is with the eyes, eyebrows, no&s;e, and each part of the counte|nance.</P>
<P>The &s;ame proportion exi&s;ts between the great features of the face; and as there is this general proportion in all countenances, however various, &s;o is there a &s;imilar proportion between the &s;mall traits of the&s;e parts. Infinitely varied are the great features, in their general combination and propor|tion. As infinitely varied are the &s;hades of the &s;mall traits, in the&s;e features, however great their
<PB N="242" REF="027203_0253_0FD3D3B4890A50D8">
general re&s;emblance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Without an accurate know|ledge of the proportion of the principal features, as for example, of the eyes and mouth, to each other, it mu&s;t ever be mere accident, and accident that in|deed rarely happens, when &s;uch proportion exi&s;ts in the works of the painter. Without an accurate knowledge of the particular con&s;tituent parts, and traits of each principal feature, I once again repeat, it mu&s;t be accident, miraculous accident, &s;hould any one of them be ju&s;tly delineated.</P>
<P>This remark may induce the reflecting arti&s;t to &s;tudy nature intimately by principle, and to &s;how him, if he be in &s;earch of permanent fame, that, though he ought to behold and &s;tudy the works of the greate&s;t ma&s;ters with e&s;teem and reverence, he yet ought to examine and judge for him&s;elf. Let him not make the virtue mode&s;ty his plea, for un|der this does omnipre&s;ent mediocrity &s;helter it&s;elf. Mode&s;ty, indeed, is not &s;o properly virtue as the garb and ornament of virtue, and of exi&s;ting po&s;i|tive power. Let him, I &s;ay, examine for him&s;elf, and &s;tudy nature in whole and in part, as if no man ever had ob&s;erved, or ever &s;hould ob&s;erve, but him|&s;elf. Deprived of this, young arti&s;t, thy glory, will but re&s;emble a meteor's blaze; it will only be founded on the ignorance of thy cotemporaries.</P>
<P>By far the greate&s;t part of the be&s;t portrait paint|ers, when mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful, like the majority of phy&s;iognomi&s;ts, content them&s;elves with expre&s;&s;ing the character of the pa&s;&s;ions in the moveable, the mu&s;cular features of the face. They do not un|der&s;tand, they laugh at, rules which pre&s;cribe the grand outline of the countenance as indi&s;pen&s;able to portrait painting, independent of the effects pro|duced by the action of the mu&s;cles.</P>
<P>Till in&s;titutions &s;hall be formed for the improve|ment of portrait painting, perhaps till a phy&s;iogno|monical &s;ociety or academy &s;hall produce phy&s;iog|nomonical portrait painters, we &s;hall at be&s;t but
<PB N="243" REF="027203_0254_0FD3D432F1E35CC0">
creep in the regions of phy&s;iognomy, where we might otherwi&s;e &s;oar. One of the greate&s;t ob&s;tacles to phy&s;iognomy is the actual, incredible imperfection of this art. There is generally a defect of eye, or hand of the painter, or the object is defective which is to be delineated, or, perhaps, all three. The arti&s;t cannot di&s;cover what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, or cannot draw it when he di&s;covers it. The object continually alters its po&s;ition, which ought to be &s;o exact, &s;o continu|ally the &s;ame; or &s;hould it not, and &s;hould the painter be endowed with an all-ob&s;erving eye, an all-imitative hand, &s;till there is the la&s;t in&s;uperable difficulty, that of the po&s;ition of the body, which can but be momentary, which is con&s;trained, fal&s;e, and unnatural, when more than momentary.</P>
<P>What I have &s;aid is trifling, indeed, to what might be &s;aid. According to the knowledge I have of it, this is yet uncultivated ground. How little has Sultzer him&s;elf &s;aid on the &s;ubject! But what could he &s;ay in a dictionary? A work wholly dedi|cated to this is nece&s;&s;ary to examine and decide on the works of the be&s;t portrait painters, and to in|&s;ert all the cautions and rules nece&s;&s;ary for the young arti&s;t, in con&s;equence of the infinite variety, yet incredible uniformity, of the human counte|nance.</P>
<P>The arti&s;t who wi&s;hes to paint portraits perfectly, mu&s;t &s;o paint, that each &s;pectator may, with truth exclaim, "This is indeed to paint! this is true, living likene&s;s; perfect nature; it is not painting!

<P>Mi&s;cellaneous Quotations.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. "CAMPANELLA has not only made very ac|curate ob&s;ervations on human faces, but was very expert in mimicking &s;uch as were any way re|markable. Whenever he thought proper to pene|trate into the inclinations of tho&s;e he had to deal with, he compo&s;ed his face, his ge&s;tures, and his whole body, as nearly as he could into the exact &s;i|militude of the per&s;on he intended to examine, and then carefully ob&s;erved what turn of mind he &s;eem|ed to acquire by his change. So that, &s;ays my au|thor, he was able to enter into the di&s;po&s;ition and thoughts of people, as effectually as if he had been changed into the very man. I have often ob&s;erved that, on mimicking the ge&s;tures and looks of angry, or placid, or frightened, or daring men, I have involuntarily found my mind turned into that pa&s;|&s;ion, who&s;e appearance I endeavoured to imitate. Nay, I am convinced, it is hard to avoid it, though one &s;trove to &s;eparate the pa&s;&s;ion from its corre&s;|pondent ge&s;tures. Our minds and bodies are &s;o clo&s;e|ly and intimately connected, that one is incapable of pain or plea&s;ure without the other. Campanella, of whom we have been &s;peaking, could &s;o ab&s;tract his attention from any &s;ufferings of his body, that he was able to endure the rack it&s;elf without much pain; and, in le&s;&s;er pains, every body mu&s;t have ob&s;erved, that, when we can employ our attention on any thing el&s;e, the pain has been for a time &s;u&s;pended. On the other hand, if by any means the body is indi&s;po&s;ed to perform &s;uch ge&s;tures, or to be &s;timulated into &s;uch emotions as any pa&s;&s;ion u&s;ually produces in it, that pa&s;&s;ion it&s;elf never can ari&s;e, though it &s;hould

be merely mental, and immediately affecting none of the &s;en&s;es. As an opiate or &s;piritous liquor &s;hall &s;u&s;pend the operation of grief, fear, or anger, in &s;pite of all our efforts to the contrary; and this by inducing in the body a di&s;po&s;ition contrary to that which it receives from the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions."

<P>Miscellaneous Thoughts.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. ALL is good. All good may, and mu&s;t be mi&s;|u&s;ed. Phy&s;iognomonical &s;en&s;ation is in it&s;elf as truly good as godlike, as expre&s;&s;ive of the exalt|ed worth of human nature as moral &s;en&s;ation, per|haps
<PB N="249" REF="027203_0261_0FD3D43CC31DF940">
they are both the &s;ame. The &s;uppre&s;&s;ing, the de&s;troying a &s;en&s;ation &s;o de&s;erving of honour, where it begins to act, is &s;inning again&s;t our&s;elves, and in reality equal to re&s;i&s;ting the good &s;pirit. Indeed, good impul&s;es and actions mu&s;t have their limits, in order that they may not impede other good im|pul&s;es and actions.</P>
<P N="2">2. Each man is a man of genius in his large or &s;mall &s;phere. He has a certain circle in which he can act with inconceivable force. The le&s;s his kingdom, the more concentrated is his power, con|&s;equently the more irre&s;i&s;tible is his form of go|vernment. Thus the bee is the greate&s;t of mathe|maticians, as far as its wants extend. Having di&s;|covered the genius of a man, how incon&s;iderable &s;oever the circle of his activity may be, having caught him in the moment when his genius is in its highe&s;t exertions, the characteri&s;tic token of that genius will al&s;o be ea&s;ily di&s;covered.</P>
<P N="3">3. The approach of the Godhead cannot be nearer, in the vi&s;ible world, and in what we deno|minate nature, than in the countenance of a great and noble man. Chri&s;t could not but truly &s;ay, "He who &s;eeth me &s;eeth Him that &s;ent me." God cannot, without a miracle, be &s;een any where &s;o fully as in the countenance of a good man. Thus the e&s;&s;ence of any man is more pre&s;ent, more cer|tain to me, by having obtained his &s;hade.</P>
<P N="4">4. Great countenances awaken and &s;timulate each other, excite all that can be excited. Any na|tion, having once produced a Spencer, a Shake|&s;peare, and a Milton, may be certain that a Steele, a Pope, and an Addi&s;on will follow. A great coun|tenance has the credentials of its high original in it|&s;elf. With calm reverence and &s;implicity nouri&s;h the mind with the pre&s;ence of a great countenance; its emanations &s;hall attract and exalt thee. A great countenance, in a &s;tate of re&s;t, acts more powerfully than a common countenance impa&s;&s;ioned; its ef|fects,
<PB N="250" REF="027203_0262_0FD3D3CC94A8D568">
though unre&s;embling, are general. The for|tunate di&s;ciples, though they knew Him not, yet did their hearts burn within them, while he talked with them by the way, and opened to them the &s;criptures. The buyers and &s;ellers whom he drove out of the Temple, dur&s;t not oppo&s;e him.</P>
<P>It may from hence be conceived how certain per|&s;ons, by their mere pre&s;ence, have brought a &s;edi|tious multitude back to their duty, although the latter had acquired the full power. That natural, unborrowed, indwelling power, which is con&s;e|quently &s;uperior to any which can be a&s;&s;umed, is as evident to all eyes as the thunder of heaven is to all ears.</P>
<P N="5">5. Great phy&s;iognomonical wi&s;dom not only con&s;i&s;ts in di&s;covering the general character of, and being highly affected by the pre&s;ent countenance, or this or that particular propen&s;ity, but in di&s;cri|minating the individual character of each kind of mind, and its capacity, and being able to define the circle beyond which it cannot pa&s;s; to &s;ay what &s;en&s;ation, actions, and judgments, are, or are not, to be expected from the man under con&s;ideration, that we may not idly wa&s;te power, but di&s;pen&s;e ju&s;t &s;ufficient to actuate, and put him in motion.</P>
<P>No man is more liable to the error of thoughtle&s;s ha&s;te than I was. Four or five years of phy&s;iog|nomonical ob&s;ervation were requi&s;ite to cure me of this too ha&s;ty wa&s;te of power. It is a part of bene|volence to give, intru&s;t, and participate; but phy|&s;iognomy teaches when, how, and to whom to give. It therefore teaches true benevolence to a&s;&s;i&s;t where a&s;&s;i&s;tance is wanted, and will be accepted. Oh! that I could call at the proper moment, and with proper effect, to the feeling and benevolent heart. Wa&s;te not, ca&s;t not thy &s;eed upon the wa|ters, or upon a rock. Speak only to the hearer; unbo&s;om thy&s;elf but to tho&s;e who can under&s;tand thee; philo&s;ophize with none but philo&s;ophers; &s;pi|ritualize
<PB N="251" REF="027203_0263_0FD3D4400732C9E8">
only with the &s;piritual. It requires greater power to bridle &s;trength than to give it the rein. To withhold is often better than to give. What is not enjoyed will be ca&s;t back with acrimony, or trodden to wa&s;te, and thus will become u&s;ele&s;s to all.</P>
<P N="6">6. To the good be good; re&s;i&s;t not the irre&s;i&s;ti|ble countenance. Give the eye that a&s;ks, that comes recommended to thee by Providence, or by God him&s;elf, and which to reject is to reject God, who cannot a&s;k thee more powerfully than when en|treating in a cheerful, open, innocent countenance. Thou can&s;t not more immediately glorify God than by wi&s;hing and acting well to a countenance replete with the &s;pirit of God; no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> more certainly, and abhorrently, offend and wound the maje&s;ty of God, than by de&s;pi&s;ing, ridiculing, and turning from &s;uch a countenance. God cannot more effectually move man than by man. Whoever rejects the man of God, rejects God. To di&s;cover the radiance of the Creator in the vi&s;age of man is the pre-eminent quality of man; it is the &s;ummit of wi&s;dom and benevolence to feel how much of this radiance is there, to di&s;cern this ray of Divinity through the clouds of the mo&s;t deba&s;ed countenances, and dig out this &s;mall gem of heaven from amid the ruins and rubbi&s;h by which it is encumbered.</P>
<P N="7">7. Shoulde&s;t thou, friend of man, e&s;teem phy&s;i|ognomy as highly as I do, to whom it daily becomes of greater worth, the more I di&s;cover its truth; if thou ha&s;t an eye to &s;elect the few noble, or that which is noble in the ignoble, that which is divine in all men, the immortal in what is mortal, then &s;peak little, but ob&s;erve much; di&s;pute not, but exerci&s;e thy &s;en&s;ation; for thou wilt convince no one to whom this &s;en&s;ation is wanting.</P>
<P>When noble poverty pre&s;ents to you a face, in which humility, patience, faith, and love, &s;hine con&s;picuou&s;ly, how &s;uperior will thy joy be in his
<PB N="252" REF="027203_0264_0FD3D3C3F4501AE8">
words who has told thee, "ina&s;much as thou ha&s;t done it unto one of the lea&s;t of the&s;e my brethren, thou ha&s;t done it unto me!"</P>
<P>With a &s;igh of hope you will exclaim, when youth and di&s;&s;ipation pre&s;ent them&s;elves, this fore|head was delineated by God for the &s;earch and the di&s;covery of truth. In this eye re&s;ts wi&s;dom yet unripened.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Union between the Knowledge of the Heart and Philanthropy.&mdash;Mi&s;cellaneous phy&s;iognomical Thoughts from Holy Writ.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>MAY the union between the knowledge of the heart and philanthropy be obtained by the &s;ame means? Does not a knowledge of the heart de&s;troy or weaken philanthropy? Does not our good opinion of any man dimini&s;h when he is per|fectly known? And if &s;o, how may philanthropy be increa&s;ed by this knowledge?</P>
<P>What is here alledged is truth; but it is partial truth. And how fruitful a &s;ource of error is par|tial truth! It is a certain truth, that the majority of men are lo&s;ers, by being accurately known. But it is no le&s;s true, that the majority of men gain as much on one &s;ide, as they lo&s;e on the other by being thus accurately known. Who is &s;o wi&s;e as never to act fooli&s;hly? Where is the virtue wholly unpolluted by vice; with thoughts, at all moments, &s;imple, direct, and pure? I dare undertake to main|tain, that all men, with &s;ome very rare exceptions, lo&s;e by being known. But it may al&s;o be proved,
<PB N="253" REF="027203_0265_0FD3D448088C5EA8">
by the mo&s;t irrefragable arguments, that all men gain by being known; con&s;equently a knowledge of the heart is not detrimental to the love of man|kind, but promotes it.</P>
<P>Phy&s;iognomy di&s;covers actual and po&s;&s;ible per|fections, which, without its aid, mu&s;t ever have remained hidden. The more man is &s;tudied, the more power and po&s;itive goodne&s;s he will be di&s;co|vered to po&s;&s;e&s;s. As the experienced eye of the painter, perceives a thou&s;and &s;mall &s;hades and co|lours, which are unremarked by common &s;pecta|tors, &s;o the phy&s;iognomi&s;t views a multitude of ac|tual or po&s;&s;ible perfections, which e&s;cape the gene|ral eye of the de&s;pi&s;er, the &s;landerer, or even the more benevolent judge of mankind.</P>
<P>I &s;peak from experience the good which I, as a phy&s;iognomi&s;t, have ob&s;erved in people round me, has more than compen&s;ated that ma&s;s of evil, which, though I appeared blind, I could not avoid &s;eeing.</P>
<P>The more I have &s;tudied man, the more have I been convinced of the general influence of his fa|culties; the more have I remarked, that the origin of all evil is good, that tho&s;e very powers which made him evil, tho&s;e abilities, forces, irritability, ela&s;ticity, were all in them&s;elves actual, po&s;itive good. The ab&s;ence of the&s;e, indeed, would have occa&s;ioned the ab&s;ence of an infinity of evil, but &s;o would they likewi&s;e of an infinity of good. The e&s;&s;ence of good has given birth to much evil; but it contains in it&s;elf the po&s;&s;ibility of a &s;till infinite increa&s;e of good.</P>
<P>The lea&s;t failing of an individual incites a gene|ral outcry, and his character is at once darkened, trampled on, and de&s;troyed. The phy&s;iognomi&s;t views and prai&s;es the man whom the whole world condemns. What, does he prai&s;e vice?&mdash;No&mdash;Does he excu&s;e the vicious?&mdash;No: he whi&s;pers, or loudly affirms, "Treat this man after &s;uch a man|ner, and you will be a&s;toni&s;hed at what he is able,
<PB N="254" REF="027203_0266_0FD3D3C2C7A05CB0">
what he may be made willing to perform. He is not &s;o wicked as he appears; his countenance is better than his actions. His actions, it is true, are legible in his countenance; but not more legible than his great powers, his &s;en&s;ibility, the pliability of that heart which has had an improper bent. Give but the&s;e powers, which have rendered him vicious, another direction, and other objects, and he will perform miracles of virtue."</P>
<P>Yes, the phy&s;iognomi&s;t will pardon where the mo&s;t benevolent philanthropi&s;t mu&s;t condemn. For my&s;elf, &s;ince I have become a phy&s;iognomi&s;t, I have gained knowledge, &s;o much more accurate, of &s;o many excellent men, and have had &s;uch fre|quent occa&s;ions to rejoice my heart in the di&s;cove|ries I made concerning &s;uch men, that this, as I may &s;ay, has reconciled me to the whole human race. What I here mention as having happened to my&s;elf, each phy&s;iognomi&s;t being him&s;elf, a man, mu&s;t have undoubtedly felt.</P>

<P>"Thou ha&s;t &s;et our iniquities before thee, our &s;ecret &s;ins in the light of our countenance." P&s;alm xc. 8.&mdash;No man believes in the omni&s;cience, or has &s;o &s;trong a conviction of the pre&s;ence of God and his angels, or reads the hand of heaven &s;o vi&s;ible in the human countenance, as the phy&s;iognomi&s;t.</P>

Matt. vi. 27, 28, 33.&mdash;No man, therefore, can alter his form. The improvement of the internal will al&s;o be the improvement of the external. Let men take care of the internal, and a &s;ufficient care of the external will be the re&s;ult.</P>

But thou, when thou fa&s;te&s;t, anoint thine head and wa&s;h thy face, that thou appear not unto men to fa&s;t, but unto thy Father which is in &s;ecret, and thy Father, which &s;eeth in &s;ecret, &s;hall reward thee openly." Matt. vi. 16, 17, 18&mdash;Virtue, like vice, may be concealed from men, but not from the Father in &s;ecret, nor from him in whom his &s;pirit is, who fathoms not only the depths of humanity but of divinity. He is rewarded, who means that the good he has &s;hould be &s;een in his countenance.</P>
<P>"Some &s;eeds fell by the way &s;ide, and the fowls came and devoured them up; &s;ome fell upon &s;tony places, where they had not much earth, and forth|with they &s;prung up, becau&s;e they had no deep|ne&s;s of earth; and when the &s;un was up they were &s;corched, and becau&s;e they had not earth they wi|thered away; and &s;ome fell among thorns, and the thorns &s;prung up and choaked them; but others fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, &s;ome an hundred fold, &s;ome &s;ixty fold, &s;ome thirty fold."

<P>"If any man have ears to hear let him hear. Do you not perceive, that whatever thing from without entereth into the man it cannot defile him, becau&s;e it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats? And he &s;aid, that which cometh out of the man, that de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ileth the man." Mark vii. 16, 18, 19, 20.&mdash;This is phy&s;iognomonically true. Not exter|nal accidents, nor &s;pots which may be wa&s;hed away, not wounds which may be healed, nor even &s;cars which remain, will defile the countenance in the eye of the phy&s;iognomi&s;t, neither can paint beautify it to him.</P>
<P>"A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump." Galat. v. o.&mdash;A little vice often deforms the whole countenance. One &s;ingle fal&s;e trait makes the whole a caricature.</P>
<P>"Ye are our epi&s;tle, written in our hearts, known and read of all men. Fora&s;much as ye are manife&s;tly declared to be the epi&s;tle of Chri&s;t mi|ni&s;tered by us, written not with ink, but with the &s;pirit of the living God." 2 Cor. iii. 2, 3.&mdash;What need have the good of letters of recommendation to the good?

No letters of re|commendation can recommend the perfidious coun|tenance, nor can any &s;landerer deprive the counte|nance, beaming with the divine &s;pirit, of its letters of recommendation.

<P>Of the apparently fal&s;e deci&s;ions of Phy&s;iognomy&mdash;Of the general Objections made to Phy&s;iognomy&mdash;Parti|cular objections an&s;wered.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>ONE of the &s;tronge&s;t objections to the certainty of phy&s;iognomy is, that the be&s;t phy&s;iogno|mi&s;ts often judge very erroneou&s;ly.</P>
<P>It may be proper to make &s;ome remarks on this objection.</P>
<P>Be it granted the phy&s;iognomi&s;t often errs; that is to &s;ay, his di&s;cernment errs, not the countenance&mdash;But to conclude there is no &s;uch &s;cience as phy|&s;iognomy, becau&s;e phy&s;iognomi&s;ts err, is the &s;ame thing as to conclude there is no rea&s;on, becau&s;e there is much fal&s;e rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>To &s;uppo&s;e that, becau&s;e the phy&s;iognomi&s;t has made &s;ome fal&s;e deci&s;ions, he has no phy&s;iogno|monical di&s;cernment, is equal to &s;uppo&s;ing that a man, who had committed &s;ome mi&s;takes of memory, has no memory; or, at be&s;t, that his memory is very weak.&mdash;We mu&s;t be le&s;s ha&s;ty. We mu&s;t fir&s;t inquire in what proportion his memory is faithful, how often it has failed, how often been accurate. The mi&s;er may perform ten acts of charity; mu&s;t
<PB N="258" REF="027203_0270_0FD3D3ACDA30C5E0">
we therefore affirm he is charitable? Should we not rather inquire how much he might have given, and how often it has been his duty to give?&mdash;The virtuous man may have ten times been guilty, but before he is condemned, it ought to be a&s;ked, in how many hundred in&s;tances he has acted uprightly? He who games mu&s;t oftener lo&s;e than he who re|frains from gaming. He who &s;lides or &s;kaits upon the ice is in danger of many a fall, and of being laughed at by the le&s;s adventurous &s;pectator. Who|ever frequently gives alms, is liable, occa&s;ionally, to di&s;tribute his bounties to the unworthy. He, indeed, who never gives cannot commit the &s;ame mi&s;take, and may truly vaunt of his prudence, &s;ince he never furni&s;hes opportunities for deceit. In like manner, he who never judges never can judge fal&s;ely. The phy&s;iognomi&s;t judges oftener than the man who ridicules phy&s;iognomy, con&s;equently mu&s;t oftener err than he who never ri&s;ks a phy&s;i|ognomonical deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>Which of the favourable judgments of the bene|volent phy&s;iognomi&s;t may not be decried as fal&s;e? Is he not him&s;elf a mere man, however circum&s;pect, upright, honourable and exalted he may be; a man who has in him&s;elf the root of all evil, the germe of every vice; or, in other words, a man who&s;e mo&s;t worthy propen&s;ities, qualities, and inclinati|ons, may occa&s;ionally be over&s;trained, wre&s;ted, and warped?</P>
<P>You behold a meek man, who, after repeated and continued provocations to wrath, per&s;i&s;ts in &s;ilence; who, probably, never is overtaken by an|ger, when he him&s;elf alone is injured. The phy|&s;iognomi&s;t can read his heart, fortified to bear and forbear, and immediately exclaims, behold the mo&s;t amiable, the mo&s;t unconquerable, gentlene&s;s.&mdash;You are &s;ilent&mdash;You laugh&mdash;You leave the place, and &s;ay, "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ye on &s;uch a phy&s;iognomi&s;t!

that you &s;aw him in wrath?&mdash;Was it not when &s;ome one had mi&s;treated his friend?&mdash;"Yes, and he be|haved like a frantic man in defence of this friend, which is proof &s;ufficient that the &s;cience of phy&s;i|ognomy is a dream, and the phy&s;iognomi&s;t a dreamer."&mdash;But who is in an error, the phy&s;iog|nomi&s;t or his cen&s;urer?&mdash;The wi&s;e&s;t man may &s;ome|times utter folly&mdash;This the phy&s;iognomi&s;t knows, but, regarding it not, reveres and pronounces him a wi&s;e man.&mdash;You ridicule the deci&s;ion, for you have heard this wi&s;e man &s;ay a foolish thing.&mdash;Once, more, who is in an error?&mdash;The phy&s;iognomi&s;t does not judge from a &s;ingle incident, and often not from &s;everal combining incidents.&mdash;Nor does he, as a phy&s;iognomi&s;t, judge only by actions.

<HEAD>Of the general Objections made to Phy&s;iognomy.</HEAD>
<P>Innumerable are the objections which may be rai&s;ed again&s;t the certainty of judgments drawn from the lines and features of the human countenance. Many of the&s;e appear to me to be ea&s;y, many diffi|cult, and &s;ome impo&s;&s;ible to be an&s;wered.</P>
<P>Before I &s;elect any of them, I will fir&s;t &s;tate &s;ome general remarks, the accurate con&s;ideration, and proof of which will remove many difficulties.</P>
<P>It appears to me that, in all re&s;earches, we ought fir&s;t to inquire what can be &s;aid in defence of any propo&s;ition. One irrefragable proof of the actual exi&s;tence and certainty of a thing will overbalance ten thousand objections. One po&s;itive witne&s;s, who has all po&s;&s;ible certainty that knowledge and rea&s;on can give, will preponderate again&s;t innumerable others who who are only negative. All objections again&s;t a certain truth are in reality only negative evidence. "We never ob&s;erved this: we never experienced that."&mdash;Though ten thou&s;and &s;hould make this a&s;&s;ertion, what would it prove again&s;t one man of under&s;tanding, and &s;ound rea&s;on, who &s;hould an&s;wer, "But I have ob&s;erved, and you, al&s;o, may ob&s;erve, if you plea&s;e." No well found|ed objection can be made again&s;t the exi&s;tence of a thing vi&s;ible to &s;en&s;e. Argument cannot di&s;prove fact. No two oppo&s;ing po&s;itive facts can be addu|ced; all objections, to a fact, therefore, mu&s;t be negative.</P>
<P>Let this be applied to phy&s;iognomy. Po&s;itive proofs of the true and acknowleged &s;ignification of the face and its features, again&s;t the clearne&s;s and certainty of which nothing can be alledged, render innumerable objections, although they cannot pro|bably be an&s;wered, perfectly in&s;ignificant. Let us
<PB N="263" REF="027203_0275_0FD3D41CEEE56EA0">
therefore endeavour to inform our&s;elves of tho&s;e po&s;itive arguments which phy&s;iognomy affords. Let us fir&s;t make our&s;elves &s;tedfa&s;t in what is cer|tainly true, and we &s;hall &s;oon be enabled to an&s;wer many objections, or to reject them as unworthy any an&s;wer.</P>
<P>It appears to me that in the &s;ame proportion as a man remarks and adheres to the po&s;itive, will be the &s;trength and per&s;everance of his mind. He who&s;e talents do not &s;urpa&s;s mediocrity is accu&s;tom|ed to overlook the po&s;itive, and to maintain the ne|gative with invincible ob&s;tinacy.</P>
<P>Thou &s;houlde&s;t fir&s;t con&s;ider what thou art, what is thy knowledge, and what are thy qualities and powers, before thou inquire&s;t what thou art not, knowe&s;t not, and what the qualities and powers are that thou ha&s;t not? This is a rule which every man who wi&s;hes to be wi&s;e, virtuous and happy ought, not only to pre&s;cribe to him&s;elf, but, if I may u&s;e &s;o bold a figure, to incorporate with, and make a part of, his very &s;oul. The truly wi&s;e always fir&s;t di|rects his inquiries con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">rning what is; the man of weak intellect, the pedant, fir&s;t &s;earches for that which is wanting. The true philo&s;opher looks fir&s;t for the po&s;itive proofs of the propo&s;ition. I &s;ay fir&s;t&mdash;I am very de&s;irous that my meaning &s;hould not be mi&s;under&s;tood, and, therefore, repeat, <HI>fir&s;t.</HI> The &s;uperficial mind fir&s;t examines the negative ob|jections&mdash;This has been the method pur&s;ued by in|fidels, the opponents of Chri&s;tianity. Were it grant|ed that Chri&s;tianity were fal&s;e, &s;till this method would neither be logical, true, nor conclu&s;ive. Therefore &s;uch modes of rea&s;oning mu&s;t be &s;et a&s;ide, as neither logical nor conclu&s;ive, before we can proceed to an&s;wer objections.</P>
<P>To return once more to phy&s;iognomy, the que&s;|tion will be reduced to this&mdash;"Whether there are any proofs &s;ufficiently po&s;itive and deci&s;ive, in fa|vour of phy&s;iognomy, to induce us to di&s;regard the

<P>It may happen that learned men, of a certain de&s;cription, will endeavour to perplex me by argu|ment. They, for example, may cite the female buterfly of Reaumur, and the large winged ant, in order to prove how much we may be mi&s;taken, with re&s;pect to final cau&s;es, in the products of na|ture&mdash;They may a&s;&s;ert, <Q>wings, undoubtedly ap|pear to be given for the purpo&s;e of flight, yet the&s;e infects never fly; therefore wings are not given for that purpo&s;e.&mdash;And by a parity of rea|&s;oning, &s;ince there are wi&s;e men, who, probably do not &s;ee, eyes are not given for the purpo&s;e of &s;ight.</Q>&mdash;To &s;uch objections I &s;hall make no re|ply, for never, in my whole life, have I been able to an&s;wer a &s;ophi&s;m. I appeal only to common &s;en&s;e. I view a certain number of men, who all have the gift of fight, when they open their eyes, and there is light, and who do not &s;ee when their eyes are &s;hut. As this certain number are not &s;elect, but taken promi&s;cuou&s;ly, among millions of exi&s;ting men, it is the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible degree of probability that all men, who&s;e formation is &s;imilar, that have lived, do live, or &s;hall live, being alike provided with tho&s;e organs we call eyes, mu&s;t &s;ee. This at lea&s;t, has been the mode of arguing and concluding among all nations, and in all ages. In the &s;ame de|gree as this mode of rea&s;oning is convincing, when applied to other &s;ubjects, &s;o it is when applied to phy&s;iognomy, and is equally applicable; and, if untrue in phy&s;iognomy, it is equally untrue in eve|ry other in&s;tance.</P>
<P>I am therefore of opinion, that the defender of
<PB N="265" REF="027203_0277_0FD3D426F5A1B0C8">
phy&s;iognomy may re&s;t the truth of the &s;cience on this propo&s;ition, <Q>That it is univer&s;ally confe&s;&s;ed that, among ten, twenty, or thirty men, indi&s;|criminately &s;elected, there as certainly exi&s;ts a phy&s;iognomonical expre&s;&s;ion, or demon&s;trable corre&s;pondence of internal power and &s;en&s;ation, with external form and figure, as that, among the like number of men, in the like manner &s;e|lected, they have eyes and can &s;ee.</Q> Having proved this, he has as &s;ufficiently proved the uni|ver&s;ality and truth of phy&s;iognomy as the univer|&s;ality of &s;ight by the aid of eyes, having &s;hown that ten, twenty, or thirty men, by the aid of eyes, are all capable of &s;eeing. From a part I draw a con|clu&s;ion to the whole; whether tho&s;e I have &s;een or tho&s;e I have not.</P>
<P>But it will be an&s;wered, though this may be proved of certain features, does it therefore, fol|low that it may be proved of all?&mdash;I am per&s;uaded it may: if I am wrong &s;how me my error.</P>
<P>Having remarked that men who have eyes and ears &s;ee and hear, and being convinced that eyes were given him for the purpo&s;e of &s;ight, and ears for that of hearing; being unable longer to doubt that eyes and ears have their de&s;tined office, I think I draw no improper conclu&s;ion, when I &s;uppo&s;e that every other &s;en&s;e, and member, of this &s;ame human body, which &s;o wonderfully form a whole, has each a particular purpo&s;e; although it &s;hould happen that I am unable to di&s;cover what the par|ticular purpo&s;es of &s;o many &s;en&s;es, members, and integuments may be. Thus do I rea&s;on al&s;o, con|cerning the &s;ignification of the countenance of man, the formation of his body, and the di&s;po&s;ition of his members.</P>
<P>If it can be proved that any two or three features have a certain determinate &s;ignification, as deter|minate as that the eye is the expre&s;&s;ion of the coun|tenance, is it not accurate to conclude, according
<PB N="266" REF="027203_0278_0FD3D3D7EEF78B58">
to the mode of rea&s;oning above cited, univer&s;ally acknowledged to be ju&s;t, that tho&s;e features are al&s;o &s;ignificant, with the &s;ignification of which I am unacquainted&mdash;I think my&s;elf able to prove, to every per&s;on of the commone&s;t under&s;tanding, that all men without exception, at lea&s;t under cer|tain circum&s;tances, and in &s;ome particular feature, may, indeed, have more than one feature, of a cer|tain determinate &s;ignification; as &s;urely as I can render it comprehen&s;ible, to the &s;imple&s;t per&s;on, that certain determinate members of the human body are to an&s;wer certain determinate purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Twenty or thirty men, taken promi&s;cuou&s;ly, when they laugh, or weep, will, in the expre&s;&s;ion of their joy or grief, po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;omething in common with, or &s;imilar to, each other. Certain features will bear a greater re&s;emblance to each other among them than they otherwi&s;e do, when not in the like &s;ympathetic &s;tate of mind.</P>
<P>To me it appears evident that, &s;ince exce&s;&s;ive joy and grief are univer&s;ally acknowledged to have their peculiar expre&s;&s;ions, and that the expre&s;&s;ion of each is as different as the different pa&s;&s;ions of joy and grief, it mu&s;t, therefore, be allowed that the &s;tate of re&s;t, the medium between joy and grief, &s;hall likewi&s;e have its peculiar expre&s;&s;ion; or, in other words, that the mu&s;cles which &s;urround the eyes and lips, will indubitably be found to be in a different &s;tate.</P>
<P>If this be granted concerning the &s;tate of the mind in joy, grief, or tranquillity; why &s;hould not the &s;ame be true concerning pride, humility, patience, magnanimity, and other affections?</P>
<P>According to certain laws the &s;tone <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lies upward, when thrown with &s;ufficient force; by other laws, equally certain, it afterwards falls to the earth; and will it not remain unmoved according to laws equally fixed if &s;uffered to be at re&s;t? Joy accord|ing to certain laws expre&s;&s;ed in one manner, grief
<PB N="267" REF="027203_0279_0FD3D41DF614C1D0">
in another, and tranquillity in a third. Wherefore then &s;hall not anger, gentlene&s;s, pride, humility, and other pa&s;&s;ions, be &s;ubject to certain laws; that is, to certain fixed laws?</P>
<P>All things in nature are or are not &s;ubjected to certain laws. There is a cau&s;e for all things or there is not. All things are cau&s;e and effect, or are not. Ought we not hence to derive one of the fir&s;t axioms of philo&s;ophy? And, if this be granted, how immediately is phy&s;iognomy relieved from all objections, even from tho&s;e which we know not how to an&s;wer; that is, as &s;oon as it &s;hall be grant|ed there are certain characteri&s;tic features, in all men, as characteri&s;tic as the eyes are to the coun|tenance!</P>
<P>But, it will be &s;aid, how different are the expre&s;|&s;ions of joy and grief, of the thoughtful and the thoughtle&s;s! And how may the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions be reduced to rule?</P>
<P>How different from each other are the eyes of men, and of all creatures; the eye of an eagle from the eye of a mole, an elephant, and a fly! and yet we believe of all who have no evident &s;igns of infir|mity, or death, that they may &s;ee.</P>
<P>The feet and ears are as various as are the eyes; yet we univer&s;ally conclude of them all, they were given us for the purpo&s;es of hearing and walking.</P>
<P>The&s;e varieties by no means prevent our believ|ing that the eyes, ears, and feet, are the expre&s;&s;i|ons, the organs of &s;eeing, hearing, and walking; and why &s;hould we not draw the &s;ame conclu&s;ions concerning all features and lineaments of the hu|man body? The expre&s;&s;ions of &s;imilar di&s;po&s;itions of mind cannot have greater variety than have the eyes, ears and feet, of all beings that &s;ee, hear, and walk; yet may we as ea&s;ily ob&s;erve and determine what they have in common, as we can ob&s;erve and determine what the eyes, ears, and feet, which are

&s;o various, among all beings that &s;ee, hear, and walk, have al&s;o in common. This well con&s;idered, how many objections will be an&s;wered or, become in&s;ig|nificant!</P>

<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> The a&s;&s;ertion requires proof.</P>
<P>For my own part, after many hundred mi&s;takes, I have continually found the fault was in my want of proper ob&s;ervation.&mdash;At fir&s;t, for example, I looked for the tokens of any particular quality, too much in one place; I &s;ought and found it not, al|though I knew the per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed extraordinary

powers. I have been long before I could di&s;cover the &s;eat of character. I was deceived, &s;ometimes by &s;eeking too partially, at others, too generally. To this I was particularly liable in examining tho&s;e who had only di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in &s;ome par|ticular pur&s;uit; and, in other re&s;pects, appeared to be per&s;ons of very common abilities, men who&s;e powers were all concentrated to a point, to the ex|amination of one &s;ubject; or men who&s;e powers were very indeterminate: I expre&s;s my&s;elf impro|perly, powers which had never been excited, brought into action. Many years ago, I was ac|quainted with a great mathematician, the a&s;toni&s;h|ment of Europe; who, at the fir&s;t &s;ight, and even long after, appeared to have a very common coun|tenance. I drew a good likene&s;s of him, which obliged me to pay a more minute attention, and found a particular trait which was very marking and deci&s;ive. A &s;imilar trait to this, I many years af|terwards, di&s;covered in another per&s;on, who, though widely different, was al&s;o a man of great talents; and who, this trait excepted, had an unmeaning countenance, which &s;eemed to prove the &s;cience of phy&s;iognomy all erroneous. Never &s;ince this time have I di&s;covered that particular trait in any man who did not po&s;&s;es &s;ome peculiar merit, however &s;imple his appearance might be.</P>
<P>This proves how true and fal&s;e, at once, the ob|jection may be which &s;tates, "Such a per&s;on ap|pears to be a weak man, yet has great powers of mind."</P>
<P>I have been written to concerning D'Alembert, who&s;e countenance, contrary to all phy&s;iognomo|nical &s;cience, was one of the mo&s;t common. To this I can make no an&s;wer, unle&s;s I had &s;een D'Alembert. This much is certain, that his profile, by Cochin, which yet mu&s;t be very inferior to the original, not to mention other le&s;s obvious traits, has a forehead, and in part a no&s;e, which were ne|ver

&s;een in the countenance of any per&s;on of mo|derate, not to &s;ay mean, abilities.</P>
<P><HI>Objection</HI> 7. "We find very &s;illy people with very expre&s;&s;ive countenances."</P>
<P>Who does not daily make this remark? My only an&s;wer, which I have repeatedly given, and which I think perfectly &s;atisfactory, is, that the endow|ments of nature may be excellent; and yet by want of u&s;e, or abu&s;e, may be de&s;troyed. Power is there, but it is power mi&s;applied: the fire wa&s;ted in the pur&s;uit of plea&s;ure can no longer be applied to the di&s;covery and di&s;play of truth.&mdash;It is fire without light, fire that ineffectually burns.</P>
<P>I have the happine&s;s to be acquainted with &s;ome of the greate&s;t men in Germany and Switzerland; and I can, upon my honour, a&s;&s;ert that, of all the then of genius with whom I am acquainted, there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> not one who does not expre&s;s the degree of in|vention and powers of mind he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in the fea|tures of his countenance, and particularly in the form of his head.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only &s;elect the following names, from an innumerable multitude. Charles XII. Louis XIV. Turenne, Sully, Polignac, Monte&s;quieu, Voltaire, Diderot.&mdash;Newton, Clarke, Maupertuis, Pope, Locke, Swift, Le&s;&s;ing, Bodmer, Sultzer, Haller. I believe the character of greatne&s;s in the&s;e heads is vi&s;ible in every well drawn outline. I could pro|duce numerous &s;pecimens, among which an experi|enced eye would &s;carcely ever be mi&s;taken.</P>
