Howbeit, the high Places were not taken away; for as yet the People had not prepared their Hearts unto the GOO of their Fathers.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WE have the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Jeho&s;aphat</HI>'s Reign in this, and in the Three foregoing Chapters: Be|ing &s;et on the Throne of his Father, (as we read <HI>Chapt.</HI> 17. <HI>ver.</HI> 1.) He &s;ets him&s;elf betimes to &s;eek the LORD God of his Father, and to promote the Work of Reformation in <HI>Judah</HI>; GOD was plea&s;ed to own him in this work, and to crown him with Riches &amp; Honour; (<HI>Ver</HI> 5, 6.) &s;o that the fear of him fell on the Nations round a|bout; they bring him Pre&s;ents and pay him
<PB N="2" REF="002232_0004_0FDAD42F8430D0A0">
Tribute, (<HI>Ver.</HI> 11) Hence we might note; That the be&s;t way for Princes when they come to Sit on the Throne to Provide for their own Honour and &s;afety &amp; for the good of their People, is to begin with matters of Religion. If a People over whom they Rule be grown Corrupt the be&s;t way they can take to make their Reign Long and Pro&s;|perous, is to &s;et about the Work of Refor|mation in the fir&s;t place. We Read of his care for the Safety of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> and his doing much Bu&s;ine&s;s in <HI>Judah,</HI> by Building <HI>Ca&s;tles and Citys of Store</HI> in it, (<HI>Ver</HI> 12,) and <HI>Placing his Men of War</HI> in the Fenced Citys, to the end of the Chapter. Hence note; That Religion is no hindrance to Worldly Bu&s;i|ne&s;s; Men may be concerned for the one &amp; not neglect the other. <HI>Subordinata non puga|nan</HI>; Both the&s;e Ends may be pur&s;ued to good Advantage by the Heads and Rulers of a People: But alas! The Brighte&s;t Suns have their Spots, and the Be&s;t of Men have their Defects. We Read of an Error in, his Conduct in the beginning of the next Chap|ter in his Joyning in Affinity with <HI>Ahab,</HI> and going up with him to <HI>Ramoth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> to Battle again&s;t the <HI>Syrians,</HI> in which Engage|ment his Life is Expo&s;ed, and <HI>Ahab</HI> receives his Death's Wound; The Story of this of which I give you a brief hint is contained at

large in the Eighteenth Chapter. We Read of his Returning in Safety to <HI>Jeru&s;a|lem</HI> (<HI>Chapt.</HI> I9. <HI>Ver</HI> 1.) And of his being Reproved by <HI>Jehu</HI> the Son of <HI>Hanani</HI> the Seer for what he had done (<HI>Ver.</HI> 2) After this he Vi&s;its the Kingdom from one end of it to the other, the better to know the &s;tate of his People, and further to Reform what he found to be Ami&s;s among them, or to &s;up|ply and make up what might be wanting. We Read of his &s;etting Judges in the Land throughout all the Fenced Citys of <HI>Judah,</HI> and giving them a Solemn Charge (<HI>Ver.</HI> 5, 6, 7) So of his &s;etting Officers over the Hou&s;e of the Lord, to in&s;pect the Service, Wor&s;hip and Government of it, (<HI>Ver.</HI> 8.) And of his giving them their Re&s;pective Charges and Directions to the end of the Chapter.</P>
<P>[But however the Prophet had told him of his Error in Uniting with <HI>Ahab</HI> and A&s;|&s;i&s;ting him that was Gods open and Avowed Enemy, and that for this there was wrath upon him from before the Lord, <HI>i e.</HI> God was Angry for it, and would give &s;ome &s;pe|cial Te&s;timony again&s;t him for it in the way of his Providence.]</P>
<P>Now the beginning of this Twentieth Chapter in which the Text is contained, &s;eems to have &s;ome re&s;pect to that Rebuke
<PB N="4" REF="002232_0006_0FDAD4359FEAE218">
&amp; Threatning; as if God were about to ful|fil &amp; to accompli&s;h it; for we read here that the Men of <HI>Moab, Ammon and Mount Scir,</HI> a Numerous Baud are Combined again&s;t him; upon the Report of this he is &s;ore afraid; &s;ets him&s;elf to Seek the Lord, and Proclaims a Fa&s;t throughout all <HI>Judah,</HI> (<HI>Ver.</HI> 3, 4.) We read of his Prayer in the Audience of the Congregation, (from the 5 <HI>Ver. to the</HI> 12 <HI>Ver. inclu&s;ively.</HI>) So of the An&s;wer and the great Overthrow of his Enemies Con&s;equent upon it (from the 14. <HI>Ver. to the</HI> 25. <HI>Ver.</HI>) The People of <HI>Judah</HI> are much Affected with this Signal Salvation wrought for them by the Mighty Hand of God; So that they A&s;|&s;emble them&s;elves in the Valley of <HI>Berachah</HI> to Ble&s;s the Lord, (<HI>Ver.</HI> 26.) We Read of their Triumphant Return to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> (<HI>Ver.</HI> 27, 28) This great Overthrow wrought by the Hand of the Lord, &s;trikes a Dread into the Enemies of <HI>Judah</HI>; So that the Realm has Re&s;t and Quiet round about: And the Chapter Concludes the Scene of his Happy Reign, for we Read of his Death and Bu|rial in the beginning of the next:</P>
<P>Yet in the Clo&s;e of all, his Imperfection as noted in Two Things.</P>
<P N="1">1. In this, <HI>That he did not Compleat the Work of Reformation.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="5" REF="002232_0007_0FDAD43794B41450">2 <HI>In his Joyning with Ahaziah that was very wicked, in matters of Bu&s;ine&s;s and Trade</HI>; An Evil like to the former, in Uniting with his Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her <HI>Ahab</HI>: For this God is Angry, &amp; the Mea&s;ures concerted between them are bro|ken. [See this from <HI>Ver.</HI> 35. to the end of the Chapter.] But my work is to Con&s;ider his Failing in the fir&s;t Head, (<HI>Ver.</HI> 33) In the Words note then the&s;e two Things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That though Jeho&s;aphat went a great way in the work of Reformation, yet he was not Able to go through with it</HI>: In&s;tance is given where|in he Failed; We are told, <HI>He walked in the ways of A&s;a his Father,</HI> (Ver. 32.) And <HI>De|parted not from it, doing that which was right in the &s;ight of the Lord; howbeit the high places were not taken away.</HI> By high Places in Pro|priety of Speech, we Under&s;tand the Hills, High Grounds, places of the Earth above others; and the Original Word will bear this &s;en&s;e, it &s;ignifies in its Primitive the Height of any thing, as the Top of Hills and Moun|tains, &amp;c. And is here Metonimically u&s;ed to Expre&s;s the Altars Erected in &s;uch Places for Sacrifice, or any Images &s;et up in them for Religious Wor&s;hip, or their Wor&s;hiping the True God in &s;uch places from a Corrupt Conformity to the Heathen: We read con|cerning the Heathen Nations that they had <HI>Many gods</HI> or Subordinate Deities; they
<PB N="6" REF="002232_0008_0FDAD43B4D61A8C0">
Limited them to particular Kingdoms, Ci|ties, Hills, Groves, &amp;c Agreeable to this noti|on they &s;et up their Temples, Chappels or Altars for Wor&s;hip, in their Re&s;pective Pla|ces; Now the Men of <HI>I&s;rael and Judah</HI> had learnt their way and were very hardly brought off from it: Hence tis noted as a Failure in him and &s;ome other of the Pious Kings of <HI>Judah</HI> &s;et to Reform the People: though they did many things in the Work yet here they Failed and came &s;hort. But here &s;eems to ari&s;e a Difficulty to Reconcile the Text, with <HI>Chap.</HI> 17. <HI>Ver.</HI> 6. For there we Read, that <HI>he took away the high places and the groves out of Judah.</HI> Two Things are offered to Reconcile the Texts.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) That he took them away in part, but not in whole; only &s;uch where Images were Wor&s;hiped.</P>
<P N="2">(2) They might be taken away in the be|ginning of his Reign and be &s;et up a new in the latter part of it; when the King was grown into Years, and not &s;o well Able to look after the &s;tate of the People, or el&s;e was now grown more Remi&s;s in matters of Reli|gion.</P>
<P N="2">2. Note the Ground of this; <HI>For as yet the People had not Prepared their Hearts to the God of their Fathers</HI>: They had not got their Hearts Acted and Prepared for this Work,
<PB N="7" REF="002232_0009_0FDAD43CBA8B3A78">
&s;o as to pur&s;ue it, &amp; to go thro' with it. The Word in its root &s;ignifies to Fit, Form, Pre|pare, Confirm, &amp;c. Tis &s;ometimes taken in an Ill &s;en&s;e and points out the Judgments of God, ready to be brought on Wicked Men, which he has fitted for them, P&s;al. 7.13. <HI>He hath prepared for him the Instruments of Death,</HI> &amp;c. And tis no more than what a Sinning People have cau&s;e to expect, if they prove Incorrigible for all the means u&s;ed to Re|form and to Amend them. <HI>Judah</HI> is here Blam'd, and not the King in the Ca&s;e; they were not Prepared and &s;teadily bent to Seek the Lord God of their Fathers in Sincerity; and to Conform to him in every thing, without any Re&s;erve. They would Wor|&s;hip the True God, yet not be Confin'd to the Temple, but for Convenience, Ea&s;e, and from Affection to their Ancient Cu&s;tom, would yet Wor&s;hip him in the High Places. This <HI>Jeho&s;aphat</HI> was Forced to Connive at, or was not Able to Redre&s;s. Antiquity is very Venerable in matters of Religion, and proves many times a good Pa&s;s-port for Error: their Di&s;ea&s;e was very Inveterate and hard to be Cured. <HI>Jer.</HI> 13.23 Be&s;ides there might need Prudence to be u&s;ed here (as in every Re|formation of Weight) to carry on the Work by degrees; lea&s;t by driving too fa&s;t, he &s;hould beget &s;trong Prejudices in the People
<PB N="8" REF="002232_0010_0FDAD43D8D6104B0">
again&s;t it. And &s;o he might lo&s;e the ground that he had gained.</P>
<P>From the Words thus Opened, we may note this Doctrine.</P>
<P><HI>DOCT</HI> That however, Pious Rulers may be Spirited for the Work of Reformation; tis not to be Expected they &s;hould go through with the Work, except the Heart of the People be Pre|pared and Di&s;po&s;ed for it.</P>
<P>Tis given as the Rea&s;on in the Text, why King Jeho&s;aphat came &s;hort in the Work and did not fini&s;h it, tho' a Man of Spirit and Re&s;olution for the Work: even becau&s;e the Heart of the People was not touched aright, ca&s;t into Gods Mould, &s;o as to &s;eek him in Sincerity, their Heart was not right with God: Hence Obedience was Partial and Feigned, now wherein twas Agreeable to their Intere&s;t, Temper and Humour, they were ready to Conform; but wherein Con|venience, Cu&s;tom, Particular Affection did Oppo&s;e, Prejudice Weighed the Ballance to the Contrary &s;ide, and there was nothing more to be done.</P>
<P>In the Handling of the Doctrine, I &s;hall Labour to give &s;ome An&s;wer to the&s;e two Enquiries:</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="002232_0011_0FDAD44304240348"><HI>Que&s;t</HI> I. When may a Corrupt and Sinning People, be &s;aid to be Prepared for the Work of Reformation?</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t</HI> II. How does it appear that Pious Ru|lers however Spirited for the Work, are not like to go through with it, except the Heart of the People be Prepared for it?</P>
<P>Of the&s;e in Order:</P>
<P>Que&s;t I <HI>When may a Corrupt and Sinning People he &s;aid to be Prepared for the Work of Reformation?</HI> When is the Heat Fitted, Bent and Di&s;po&s;ed for this great Work? We may take up the An&s;wer to this Enqui|ry, in the following Heads</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>When they are willing to u&s;e the Means of Conviction.</HI> A People grown very Degene|rate, are unwilling to u&s;e the Means of Conviction The have choice means of Conviction in the Word, and &s;o in the Providence of God but they dont care to u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e them for this end: So God Complains of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> when he &s;ent his Prophets among them, to tell them of their Sins, and to De|nounce his Judgments, they would not hearken unto them, <HI>Jer.</HI> 7.25.26. The like is Noted of the Judgments of God upon them at times, tho' Compar'd <HI>to the Light that goeth
<PB N="10" REF="002232_0012_0FDAD44482A0E1D0">
forth,</HI> Ho&s;. 6.5. Speedy in their motions, ter|rible in their operations; yet they were car|ried by the impetuous motion of their cor|rupt Affections, headlong into Sin without u&s;ing the power of Self-reflection God had given them, <HI>Jer.</HI> 8 6. The &s;ame &s;pirit Chri&s;t Him&s;elf notes in the <HI>Jews</HI> in his day, That they &s;hut their Eyes again&s;t the light, &amp; did very much oppo&s;e the Means of Conviction from a love to their Lu&s;ts, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3 19 But now when they are brought to &s;ee the need they &s;tand in of Conviction, and to u&s;e the means for this end; to &s;ubmit to Duty, and to re|flect on their ways, they may be &s;aid in a de|gree to be prepared for the work: Jer. 2.23. <HI>See thy way in the valley, and know what 'tis thou ha&s;t done.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>When they have any clear Conviction.</HI> When they are brought not only to &s;ubmit to the means of Conviction, but Warnings, Reproofs, Threatnings and Judgments have been &s;et home, &s;o as to give them &s;ome di&s;tinct view of their evil ways &amp; corrupt carriages, they now lie fair for a Reformation; When a People &s;ee their Pride, Murmurings, Intem|perance, Inju&s;tice, Covetou&s;ne&s;s, Formality in Religion, vi&s;ible Contempt of God's Word &amp; Ordinances, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> there is now &s;ome ground to hope the&s;e &amp; other Sins they are guilty of may come to be Reformed. A People under
<PB N="11" REF="002232_0013_0FDAD44914B75070">
this Conviction when call'd upon to Return, will know wherein they ought to Return. Particular Per&s;ons are in the way to Reform when they fall under clear and &s;trong Con|viction; and 'tis &s;o with the Body of a People. Hence <HI>Searching &amp; Trying</HI> as the means of Con|viction is &s;poken of by the Church, as ante|cedent to her <HI>turning to the Lord,</HI> Lam. 3.40</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>When they &s;ee their way of Sin to be De|&s;tructive &amp; Ruinous to them.</HI> A Sinning Peo|ple whil&s;t &s;ecure are very apt to flatter them|&s;elves to ward off Threatnings &amp; to fence a|gain&s;t Judgments. See <HI>Deut.</HI> 29.19. &amp; <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 28.15 Tis the frame of Particular Per&s;ons in a &s;tate of carnal Security; and 'tis the frame of the Body of a People, till God comes to Convince &amp; Awaken them; They &s;ee not the deadly and fatal tendency of their ways: But now when God will Reform &amp; Amend them, He &s;hews them their way is not &s;afe but danger|ous; that 'tis not the way to Pro&s;per, but 'tis the way to De&s;truction, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.16. And by this means he checks them in their Career, &amp; makes them afraid of their Cour&s;e. There is a natural dread of Mi&s;ery in every man: hence men mu&s;t Think of turning their way when they &s;ee it leads to Ruine. We &s;ee this to be founded in the light of Rea&s;on, in the In&s;tance given of the People of <HI>Nineveh</HI> when threatned with &s;udden De&s;truction,
<PB N="12" REF="002232_0014_0FDAD44A579C5B78">
they are brought by it to Reform &amp; to Cry mightily to God for Mercy, <HI>Jonah</HI> 3.7, 8, 9.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>When they &s;ee they are in the way to be a happy People, upon their Reformation &amp; Return to God.</HI> A Sinning People bro't into Di&s;tre&s;s by Sickne&s;s, Poverty, Famine, Sword, Bon|dage, U&s;ury, Inju&s;tice, Opre&s;&s;ion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> if they be not quite pa&s;t feeling, they are wont to &s;hew an Unea&s;y Spirit; They want to have the&s;e Evils removed &amp; to be bro't into good Circum&s;tances, but they &s;ee not how 'tis to be brought about by a better Regard to the Rules of Religion, they be not convict that the Evils bro't upon them are the fruit of their corrupt Carriages; Hence &s;ee not that Reformation is the way to Pro&s;per; they can't &s;ee their Happine&s;s to be &s;ecured by their being a Religious People; &s;ome that are better than others fare no better than others but wor&s;e in &s;ome re&s;pects, according to that remark. <HI>He that departeth from evil maketh him&s;elf a prey,</HI> I&s;a. 59.15. Hence when called upon to be Ju&s;t and Hone&s;t in their dealings, to te Sober, Temperate, True &amp; Faithful, to be Quiet &amp; Peaceable men; they pre&s;ently Object &amp; &s;ay, <HI>Cui bon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> What &s;hall we get by i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">? Is there any Profit in it? And &s;o long as they can &s;ee none, they are Prejudiced again&s;t Religion; Rea&s;on as they, Job 21.15 <HI>What is the Almighty that we &s;hould &s;erve him, &amp; what
<PB N="13" REF="002232_0015_0FDAD44BDC37FBD8">
profit &s;hould have if we pray unto him?</HI> But now an Argument drawn, <HI>Ab Utili,</HI> is well relish'd by them: and is as a &s;weet &s;melling Savour in the no&s;trils of Carnal men; when they come to &s;ee' will be the way to Pro&s;per &amp; to be a happy People, 'tis to be hoped they will re&s;olve as <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> Ho&s; 2.7. <HI>I will go &amp; re|turn to my fir&s;t husband, for then it was better with me than now.</HI></P>
<P>Que&s;t II. <HI>Whence is it we are not to expect that Pious Rulers, however &s;pirited for the work, &s;hould be able to go through with it, except the Heart of the People be prepar'd for it?</HI> To this I An&s;wer in Two things, which may &s;erve to clear up the Doctrine and to &s;et forth the ground &amp; rea&s;on of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Becau&s;e there be many Sins that will e&s;cape their Notice &amp; Ob&s;ervation.</HI> If they be very curious &amp; wakeful in their Remarks, yet there will be many deeds of Darkne&s;s that will e&s;|cape their notice: There will be &s;ecret In|temperance, Uncleane&s;&s;, Wantone&s;s, Inju&s;tice, Lying, Forgery, Idolatry, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Ezek. 8.12 <HI>See&s;t thou what they do in the dark?</HI> Hence if there be good Laws made for the curbing Men from Sin &amp; the Executive Power be lodged in the Hands of tho&s;e that are men of Spirit &amp; Re|&s;olution for the work: they can't u&s;e it for the Correcting &s;uch Secret Wickedne&s;s, The
<PB N="14" REF="002232_0016_0FDAD45005929708">
fear of Puni&s;hment will curb men from the open Acts of Sin; but men will be getting in|to &s;ecret Corners, &amp; there carrying on their Wicked De&s;igns: Be&s;ides, &s;ome Actions not Private in their nature, will be kept from the Cognizance of the Judge, for the want of ju&s;t &amp; timous Information. Men under Oath at &s;uch a time to make due Pre&s;entment of breaches of Law, won't have that Con&s;cienti|ous regard to their Duty as they ought to have: Men called in as Witne&s;&s;es before the Judge, again&s;t the Criminal, will be very back|ward to do their duty; they will trifle at a &s;trange rate with a &s;olemn Oath, rather than di&s;gu&s;t a Friend or di&s;oblige a good Nei'bor: and there may be this temptation too to de|cline it in &s;ome even a con&s;cience of guilt. That they are chargeable with the &s;ame Crime, &amp; there only needs Complaint or In|formation to be made again&s;t them in order to their being call'd in Que&s;tion; which their Neighbours will be &s;ure to make (being privy to the matter) if they don't favour them as much as po&s;&s;ible in the Ca&s;e depending Now if the Sins of a People don't come under the Notice of Rulers, they are not in the way to Reform and Amend them. Now &s;uch Sins involve a People in Guilt, and lay them open to the Judgments of God, if they be very great, of a deep dye; become general; and
<PB N="15" REF="002232_0017_0FDAD4510E7E9240">
are not &s;o properly Secret, but are kept hid from Publick Cen&s;ure by the Countenance or Connivance of others; and there is not that care taken as might be to cut off the occa&s;ion of them: To this &s;ome Judicious Divines re|fer the in&s;tance of <HI>Achan, Jo&s;h.</HI> 7.11.

<P N="1"><PB N="49" REF="002232_0051_0FDAD4B26F4351C8">1. <HI>Tis in our power to reform many things that we know to be Ami&s;s.</HI> Many things are found ami&s;s among us that are very plain and obvi|ous; and none of us can have the face to &s;ay, tis not within our compa&s;s to reform them: God in the <HI>Publick Covenant,</HI> calls on a Sinning people to reform, now this &s;hows tis what is practicable by them, Jer. 7.3, 5. <HI>Amend your ways and doings.</HI> So <HI>Jer.</HI> 26.13.

<P N="2">2. <HI>We have choice means of Conviction in things wherein we are Dark.</HI> We have a great deal of Light held forth to us to &s;hew us what is Sinful, and that the way of Sin is de&s;tructive and ruinous; in the Pains taken by our Ru|lers to Check this and the other Vice: We have great light held forth to us from the Word of God; the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t have not cea&s;ed to <HI>&s;how unto us our Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions</HI> on this publick and &s;olemn Occa&s;ion, and al&s;o at other times; be&s;ides, the Providences of God have been many times very Convincing, and have &s;erved to point out Sin in particular, <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 6.5.

<P>Be&s;ides Now Conver&s;ion work is like to go on &amp; many Souls Saved from Wrath to come, and bro't to be the Heirs of Life: The Publick Church &s;hall &s;hare largely in that Promi&s;e, by God's Gathering in of His Elect, I&s;a. 54. 13. <HI>Thy Children &s;hall be taught of God; and great &s;hall be the Peace of thy Children.</HI> So I&s;a. 55 13. <HI>In&s;tead of the Thorn &s;hall come up the Fir|tree, &amp; in&s;tead of the Briar &s;hall come up the Myrtle|tree; and it &s;hall be to the Lord for a Name, for an everla&s;ting &s;ign which &s;hall not be cut off.</HI></P>
