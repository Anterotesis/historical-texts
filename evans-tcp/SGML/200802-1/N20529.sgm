<BIBL>PSALM CXLIV. 15.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Yea, happy is that people who&s;e GOD is the LORD.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN this pa&s;&s;age of &s;acred &s;cripture, that people is pronounced happy, who&s;e God is the LORD. But what is the meaning of the expre&s;|&s;ion, "who&s;e God is the LORD?" or when may it be truly &s;aid, that the God of any peo|ple is the LORD? The an&s;wer is, when they be|lieve, wor&s;hip and obey the Lord or Jehovah, as the only true God, and that according to his revealed will. The Lord was the God of the I&s;raelites, when they complied with the di&s;pen|&s;ation, under which they lived; and he is our God, when we cordially believe and comply with the go&s;pel. If we do &s;o, the text pronoun|ces us happy; and it plainly implies, that we cannot be happy on any condition &s;hort of this.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="026934_0005_0FD26CDACC546EE0">
THEREFORE the &s;ubject, which I beg leave to propo&s;e from our text for pre&s;ent con&s;ideration, is this, The nece&s;&s;ity of a belief of chri&s;tianity by the citizens of this &s;tate, in order to our public and political pro&s;perity. This propo&s;i|tion is plainly implied in the text. For if that people only be happy or pro&s;perous, who&s;e God is the Lord; and if to believe and comply with chri&s;tianity be implied in having the Lord for our God; it follows, that the belief of chri&s;|tianity by the citizens of this &s;tate, is nece&s;&s;ary to our political pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>POLITICAL pro&s;perity requires the general practice of a &s;trict morality. But this cannot be &s;o well &s;ecured by any other means, as by a belief of chri&s;tianity. Motives of a religious kind appear to be nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;train men from vice and immorality. Civil pains and penalities alone are by no means &s;ufficient to this end; nor are civil honours and rewards &s;ufficient encouragements to the practice of vir|tue in general. The civil magi&s;trate does not pretend to reward virtue in general according to its moral excellency. He does indeed re|ward &s;ome particular acts of virtue, which are highly beneficial to the public. But the many virtues of private life pa&s;s without any other re|ward from him, than the bare protection, which is afforded in common to the per&s;ons who prac|ti&s;e tho&s;e virtues, and to all who are free from gro&s;s crimes.</P>
<P>NOR does the magi&s;trate pretend to puni&s;h vice in general. He does undertake to puni&s;h tho&s;e gro&s;s vices, which con&s;i&s;t in the violations of the <HI>perfect</HI> rights of men, and in tho&s;e ca&s;es
<PB N="7" REF="026934_0006_0FD26CDEC0309D50">
only, in which the violations are both manife&s;t and are manife&s;tly proved before a proper tri|bunal. But all violations of even the&s;e rights which are perpetrated in private, or which, though perpetrated publicly, are not legally proved, pa&s;s entirely free from civil pains and penalties. The &s;ame is true of all violations of the <HI>imperfect</HI> rights, as they are called, which are violated by ingratitude, &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, neglect of kind offices, &amp;c. Yet the&s;e vices are in their con&s;equences, often as hurtful to the public good, as inju&s;tice, fraud or robbery; and indeed the former are the &s;ource of the latter. Now to re&s;train from vices of this latter de&s;cription, from all vices practi&s;ed in private, and from vice in general, nothing is &s;o u&s;eful as a full belief of a final judgment, and of a &s;ub&s;equent &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments, in which all &s;in not renounced by &s;incere repentance, &s;hall be puni&s;hed, and every man &s;hall receive accor|ding to that which he does in the body, whe|ther it be good or evil.</P>
<P>LET us &s;uppo&s;e a citizen re&s;trained from vice by the fear of civil penalties only. Such a per|&s;on will feel him&s;elf under no obligation to pay either public or private debts, unle&s;s he expects legal judgment and execution; and under no obligation to &s;peak the truth, unle&s;s he fears a pro&s;ecution for fraud or defamation. He will feel him&s;elf at liberty to live in idlene&s;s, profu|&s;ion, intemperance and lu&s;t, and to take every advantage con&s;i&s;tent with law, to defraud and oppre&s;s his fellow citizens. He will requite no kind offices, as he has no motive to gratitude. He will have no motive to the greater part of his duty to his own children, and in a thou&s;and
<PB N="8" REF="026934_0007_0FD26CDFE5842040">
in&s;tances may neglect them, when he is bound by the &s;tricte&s;t moral obligation, to a&s;&s;i&s;t and do them good. He may indulge him&s;elf in pa&s;|&s;ion and ill nature, in contention and violence, &s;o far as not to expo&s;e him&s;elf to the law; and of cour&s;e will take no pains to pre&s;erve peace among his neighbours; but will rather, as his humour happens to be, foment by words and actions, animo&s;ities, law-&s;uits and contentions in every form. Ever complaining under the mild|e&s;t and ju&s;te&s;t government, he will in number|le&s;s ways oppo&s;e mea&s;ures, and e&s;pecially expen|ces, &s;ub&s;ervient and nece&s;&s;ary to the public good; and will excite and &s;pread di&s;content among others. Now is this a good citizen? What if the whole &s;tate con&s;i&s;ted of &s;uch citi|zens? Could it enjoy political pro&s;perity?</P>
<P>THE be&s;t and perhaps the only remedy for &s;uch di&s;ea&s;es, is a full belief of the divine univer|&s;al providence, of the accountablene&s;s of all men to God for all their conduct, and of a fu|ture equal retribution.</P>
<P>SOME religion then, and &s;ome belief of a fu|ture &s;tate is nece&s;&s;ary to our political pro&s;perity. But what religion &s;hall we adopt? and what &s;y&s;tem concerning a future &s;tate is mo&s;t u&s;eful to the &s;tate? It is not po&s;&s;ible to introduce and give a general &s;pread through the &s;tate, to Ma|hometani&s;m or Pagani&s;m; and it would be a work of time and of great difficulty, to lead the citizens in general into the belief of Dei&s;m or what is called the philo&s;ophical religion. There|fore we &s;eem nece&s;&s;itated to have recour&s;e to chri&s;tianity: and this is mo&s;t excellently adapt|ed to the ends of re&s;training men from vice and
<PB N="9" REF="026934_0008_0FD26CE196694E00">
promoting that general practice of &s;trict morali|ty, which is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the political pro&s;perity of any people. It is adapted to the&s;e ends by its precepts; by the moral character of the au|thor of tho&s;e precepts; by his ab&s;olute &s;upremacy and &s;overeignty; by the motives of reward and puni&s;hment with which tho&s;e precepts are en|forced; by the facts which it relates, and by the examples which it exhibits. It is enforced not by the bare authority of our feeble rea&s;on, but by the authority of our Creator, our Judge, and our all-perfect God. It depends not on the ob&s;cure inve&s;tigations, &s;ubtil refinements and uncertain conclu&s;ions of human intellect; but on the omni&s;cience, the veracity, the ju&s;tice, the goodne&s;s and the will of God: And thus it is excellently adapted to the principles and feel|ings which are common to human nature, and which exi&s;t in the weake&s;t and mo&s;t ignorant, as well as the mo&s;t intelligent and learned. A man who cannot follow the &s;horte&s;t and mo&s;t ea&s;y chain of rea&s;oning on the nature of things and the tendency of human actions, and who will not from &s;uch rea&s;oning feel his obligation to vir|tue in general or to particular virtues, will at once feel the force of the po&s;itive and authorita|tive declarations and requi&s;itions of the Almigh|ty: and where is the man, learned or unlearn|ed, of weak or &s;trong powers, who does not &s;ee and feel the difference between the advice and di|rections of &s;ome learned and acute philo&s;opher, and <HI>thus &s;aith the Lord?</HI> Above all, the motives ari&s;ing from the doctrines of the final judgment and a future &s;tate, lay an inconceivably greater re&s;traint on the depravity of human nature, than any thing that is or can be &s;ugge&s;ted by the phi|lo&s;ophical religion.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="026934_0009_0FD26CE78C9AC6B0">
LET us compare this religion with chri&s;tiani|ty in a few particulars, which immediately re|late to our pre&s;ent &s;ubject.</P>
<P>IT is a maxim of infidelity to follow <HI>nature.</HI> Now to follow her, is to follow all the appe|tites and pa&s;&s;ions of which we are naturally the &s;ubjects; and this will lead to all kinds of vice. But it is a maxim of chri&s;tianity, to follow the divine law, the precepts of the go&s;pel and the example of Chri&s;t: and whether the&s;e lead to vice or virtue, I need not inform you.</P>
<P>ANOTHER maxim of infidelity is, that man was made for his own happine&s;s; that is, that every man was made for his own individual hap|pine&s;s. This then is to be the &s;upreme object of every man; and this object is to be pur&s;u|ed, as infidels them&s;elves teach, by gratifying his natural appetites and pa&s;&s;ions, which brings us ju&s;t where we were before, to all vice and wickedne&s;s: And if an infidel deny his appe|tites and pa&s;&s;ions, he mu&s;t be governed by oth|er motives than any which his &s;y&s;tem of morali|ty &s;ugge&s;ts. But chri&s;tianity teaches, that we were created for an end, which &s;o far as we pur|&s;ue, we cannot fail of &s;incere piety and &s;trict morality.</P>
<P>INFIDELS are divided into two cla&s;&s;es, tho&s;e who deny a future &s;tate of exi&s;tence, and tho&s;e who allow &s;uch a &s;tate. The former deny all moral government of God, and that we are at all accountable to him; and &s;ome of the mo&s;t noted among them deny any evidence of his moral perfections. Now it is manife&s;t, that according to this &s;y&s;tem mankind can be under
<PB N="11" REF="026934_0010_0FD26CEB8E3B2870">
no re&s;traint from vice, by the con&s;ideration of a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments, or by the con&s;ideration of their accountablene&s;s to God, or of his commands or prohibitions. Nor does this &s;y&s;tem admit of any motives de|rived from the&s;e &s;ources, to the practice of virtue. Yet the&s;e motives, with re&s;pect to mankind in the gro&s;s, are the mo&s;t powerful. The authors and abettors of this &s;y&s;tem &s;eem to rely on <HI>a &s;en&s;e of honour,</HI> as the great motive to virtue and re&s;traint from vice. And what is this <HI>&s;en&s;e of honour?</HI> If it be a &s;en&s;e of &s;hame in doing wrong, and a &s;en&s;e of the honoura|blene&s;s of doing right, it is a mere &s;en&s;e or knowledge of right and wrong; and this &s;o far as it is founded on truth, is undoubtedly a proper rule of conduct, and a man who is di&s;|po&s;ed to virtue, will practi&s;e according to this rule. But how are men in general, without the aid of revelation, to attain, in all ca&s;es, to the knowledge of right and wrong, of virtue and vice? It is manife&s;t by abundant experience both antient and modern, that mere human rea&s;on is in&s;ufficient for this.</P>
<P>IF by this &s;en&s;e of honour be meant, as I im|agine is generally meant, a &s;en&s;e of our own &s;uppo&s;ed per&s;onal dignity, a pride naturally, ari&s;ing from this &s;en&s;e, and a di&s;po&s;ition to re&s;ent and revenge every thing which is grating to our pride; this in many ca&s;es is &s;o far from a motive to virtue and re&s;traint from vice, that it is it&s;elf a vice. Let this &s;en&s;e of honour be ever &s;o well limited and explained, it cannot be a motive to virtue and a re&s;traint from vice to all men; becau&s;e it does not reach and can|not influence all men. How many are there
<PB N="12" REF="026934_0011_0FD26CED6F1A6920">
in every nation and country, who have very lit|tle &s;en&s;e of their own dignity, and very little elevation of &s;oul in a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of it? How many are there, who in a pro&s;pect of gain, would not &s;cruple to betray their friends, to &s;teal their neighbours property or to betray their country?</P>
<P>IT is manife&s;t therefore, that this philo&s;ophi|cal religion, could it be generally introduced and e&s;tabli&s;hed among us, would be a very great political evil, as it would weaken and even annihilate tho&s;e motives to virtue and re&s;taints from vice, which are mo&s;t powerful on the minds of men in general.</P>
<P>BESIDES: this &s;y&s;tem &s;o far as it denies the evidence of the moral perfections of God, not only cuts off the motives to virtue, drawn from a future &s;tate and from tho&s;e divine perfections; but even &s;ugge&s;ts motives to vice. If it be a matter of uncertainty, whether God be a friend to virtue or a friend to vice, it may be, that we &s;hall plea&s;e him mo&s;t by an unre&s;trained indul|gence of vice, and by the practice of virtue &s;hall provoke his malice and vengeance. Nay, if it be a matter of uncertainty, whether the Deity be a benevolent or malicious being, we can have no certainty, but that he will give us an exi&s;|tence in a future &s;tate, on purpo&s;e to gratify his malevolence in our everla&s;ting torment. And to be con&s;i&s;tent, the advocates for the &s;y&s;tem now under con&s;ideration &s;hould not &s;ay a word again&s;t the chri&s;tian doctrine of endle&s;s puni&s;h|ment, on the ground of its &s;uppo&s;ed inju&s;tice or oppo&s;ition to grace and mercy; becau&s;e they acknowledge, that they know not, that God is ju&s;t, gracious or merciful.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="026934_0012_0FD26CEEF8761618">
THUS this &s;cheme, which was invented to avoid the fears of future puni&s;hment, defeats it&s;elf; and while it attempts to deliver us from a ju&s;t puni&s;hment, leaves us expo&s;ed to any puni&s;hment ever &s;o unju&s;t, cruel and ma|licious.</P>
<P>As to that kind of infidelity, which allows the divine moral perfections and a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments; though this is more plau&s;ible than the former; yet the motives to virtue and re&s;traints from vice, which it af|fords, are not to be compared with tho&s;e of the go&s;pel. Agreeably to the go&s;pel all men are to be rewarded according to their works done in the body, whether they be good or evil. Some are to be beaten with few &s;tripes, &s;ome with many &s;tripes, according to their &s;everal aggravations of guilt. But in the future pun|i&s;hment which infidels admit, there is nothing vindictive, nothing therefore which is intended to &s;upport law and government. The only puni&s;hment which they admit, is that which is de&s;igned for the good of the per&s;on puni&s;hed;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Blount and Tyndal.</NOTE> and therefore as &s;oon as the per&s;on puni&s;hed repents, he is relea&s;ed. Now it is manife&s;t on the &s;lighte&s;t reflection, that the motive to avoid &s;in and vice on this plan, is exceedingly dimin|i&s;hed from what it is on the plan of the go&s;pel. On the plan of the go&s;pel the motive is endle&s;s mi&s;ery, proportioned in degree to the demerit of the per&s;on puni&s;hed. On the infidel plan it is a merciful cha&s;ti&s;ement, which is to contin|ue no longer than till the &s;ubject &s;hall repent. And as every &s;inner will naturally flatter him|&s;elf,
<PB N="14" REF="026934_0013_0FD26CF06549E9E8">
that he &s;hall repent as &s;oon as he &s;hall find his puni&s;hment to be intolerable; &s;o all the pun|i&s;hment, which on this plan he will expect, is one that &s;hall continue but for a moment, after it &s;hall have become extreme or intolerable. And whether this momentary extreme puni&s;h|ment be an equal re&s;traint on vice, as the endle&s;s mi&s;ery threatened in the go&s;pel, let every man judge. It is plain, that in a comparative view it is as nothing. Therefore as even this, the mo&s;t plau&s;ible &s;cheme of infidelity, cuts the &s;in|ews of morality and opens the flood-gates of vice; the prevalence of it in our &s;tate would be a very great political evil.</P>
<P>IF we take the pains to compare chri&s;tianity with antient pagani&s;m, we &s;hall find, that the former has, even in a political view, the like advantage over the latter, which it has over in|fidelity.&mdash;If in the account, which I &s;hall now give of the pagan religion, &s;ome things &s;hall be mentioned, which will be grating to tho&s;e of the mo&s;t delicate feelings; I think I &s;hall be entitled to the pardon of my hearers, as other|wi&s;e it will be impo&s;&s;ible for me to do ju&s;tice to this important &s;ubject.</P>
<P>PAGANISM, though it taught a future puni&s;h|ment of wicked men of certain de&s;criptions; yet indulged and even encouraged vice in a va|riety of ways. It taught that there were many gods, &s;ome male and &s;ome female; &s;ome com|paratively good, others exceedingly evil; but all and even the chief god, on many occa&s;ions acting a mo&s;t wicked part and indulging the vile&s;t lu&s;ts. Some of their female deities were decea&s;ed women of mo&s;t abandoned characters.
<PB N="15" REF="026934_0014_0FD26CF24CCE3A90">
Jupiter, whom they called <HI>the father of gods and men,</HI> was him&s;elf the &s;on of Saturn who accor|ding to &s;ome, was king of Crete; according to others, was Ham the &s;on of Noah; according to others, was Adam; but on every hypothe&s;is was a mere man. This man, the antient hea|thens believed, had a number of children, and was wont to devour them as &s;oon as they were born: but Jupiter was &s;aved by an artifice of his mother. He, grown to maturity, rebelled again&s;t his father, who till then was &s;uppo&s;ed to be the &s;upreme God, drove him from his throne, and &s;eized his authority and dominions. When Jupiter had by the&s;e means rai&s;ed him|&s;elf to the place of &s;upreme deity, he was wont to transform him&s;elf into various vi&s;ible &s;hapes, to facilitate his de&s;igns of criminal intercour&s;e with women here on earth. Now how de|&s;tructive of the intere&s;ts of virtue and morality mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have been the&s;e ideas of the gods; and e&s;pecially the&s;e ideas of the charac|ter and conduct of the &s;upreme god, <HI>Jupiter the greate&s;t and the be&s;t!</HI></P>
<P>IN like manner de&s;tructive to morality mu&s;t have been almo&s;t all their other ideas of their gods; as of their animo&s;ities and contentions among them&s;elves; of their intrigues and lu&s;ts&punc; and the vicious and mo&s;t abominable practices by which, in many in&s;tances, they were wor&s;hip|ed. The godde&s;s Venus was openly wor&s;hipped by whoredom;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Every woman among &s;ome nations was obliged, at lea&s;t once in her life, to pro&s;titute her&s;elf to any per&s;on, even the greate&s;t &s;tranger, who would accept her favour.

<PB N="16" REF="026934_0015_0FD26CF362F80AA8">
of every lewdne&s;s and debauchery. The vices of drunkenne&s;s and whoredom in the&s;e ca|&s;es were accounted, in&s;tead of moral evils, the highe&s;t acts of virtue and piety.</P>
<P>Now as all the&s;e ideas and practices tended to a general depravity of morals; &s;o their effects abundantly appeared in the vicious lives of the heathen world.</P>
<P>I AM well aware, that it has been &s;aid, that chri&s;tianity has depraved the morals of man|kind; that vice is far more predominant among chri&s;tians, than ever it was among the antient heathens; and that therefore we may ju&s;tly conclude, that chri&s;tianity is le&s;s &s;ub&s;ervient to virtue and a moral life, than pagani&s;m. This has been urged as an argument again&s;t the di|vine original and the truth of chri&s;tianity; and may be urged as an argument again&s;t the good policy of encouraging and &s;upporting it in any &s;tate. The con&s;ideration of this objection then is pertinent and nece&s;&s;ary to the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the &s;ubject now before us.</P>
<P>IN an&s;wer to this objection I beg leave to ob&s;erve in the fir&s;t place, that if vice <HI>were</HI> more predominant in chri&s;tian nations, than it was among the heathens, it would not certainly fol|low, that this increa&s;e of vice is the effect of chri&s;tianity. Chri&s;tianity prevails in civilized nations only; and in &s;uch nations there is much more opportunity for many vices and much more temptation to them, than among tho&s;e who are not civilized. Nay, in civilized nations only, is there a po&s;&s;ibility of the preva|lence of many vices. In proportion as civili|zation
<PB N="17" REF="026934_0016_0FD26CF59EC712F8">
is promoted, the wants of men are in|crea&s;ed. Their food, their drink, their apparel and the education of their children, mu&s;t be more expen&s;ive, and more expence is in every re&s;pect required to their living in fa&s;hion among their neighbours. And in proportion to the increa&s;e of their wants, the temptation to covetou&s;ne&s;s, extortion, oppre&s;&s;ion, deceit and fraud, is increa&s;ed. Again, in proportion as civilization is promoted, the means of luxury of every kind are increa&s;ed, and with the means, the temptations to luxury and luxury it&s;elf are increa&s;ed. No wonder a &s;avage, who wi&s;hes for nothing more than what he may take in hunting and fi&s;hing, and who has fur|ni&s;hed him&s;elf with this, does not &s;teal, rob or extort his neighbour's property; no wonder he attempts not to obtain it by fal&s;ehood or fraud. Nor is it any wonder, that living on &s;uch a low and &s;canty diet as he generally does, he is very rarely guilty of a rape, of adultery or other lewdne&s;s. Nor ought it to be matter of wonder, that all the&s;e vices are far more prevalent in civilized nations, than among bar|barians. But the prevalence of the&s;e vices in &s;uch nations, is not owing to chri&s;tianity, but to civilization and its u&s;ual attendants. They were at lea&s;t as prevalent among the antient Greeks and Romans, as they are among us. Per&s;ecu|tion does not u&s;ually obtain among heathen, becau&s;e either they have no religion them&s;elves to in&s;tigate them to per&s;ecution; or there is no religion different from their own, to be the object of their per&s;ecution; or if there be a differ|ent religion, it makes no oppo&s;ition to that which they have cho&s;en, and therefore their religious zeal is not excited again&s;t it.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="026934_0017_0FD26CF7A79DB940">
THIS affords an an&s;wer to an objection to chri&s;tianity much in&s;i&s;ted on by &s;ome, that the heathens do not per&s;ecute; but that chri&s;tians do mo&s;t virulently per&s;ecute even one another; and therefore that chri&s;tianity makes men wor&s;e in&s;tead of better. The an&s;wer to this objection is, that the different religious &s;entiments and forms of wor&s;hip among the antient heathens did not in general oppo&s;e each other. They rather ju&s;tified each other, as the heathens main|tained an intercommunity of gods and religions. Though every nation had its own gods and re|ligion; yet whenever the individuals went into another nation, they joined in the wor&s;hip of the gods and in the ob&s;ervance of the rites of the nation in which they then were. Therefore there was no opportunity for per&s;ecution. But the nature of chri&s;tianity is very different. It condemns and oppo&s;es all other religions as fal&s;e and ruinous. Therefore as it touches the pride of tho&s;e whom it condemns, it provokes oppo|&s;ition and the per&s;ecution of it&s;elf, merely be|cau&s;e it tells the truth. And the profe&s;&s;ors of chri&s;tianity too, by a mi&s;guided zeal, have been often led into the &s;pirit and practice of per&s;ecu|tion.</P>
<P>Now this per&s;ecution of chri&s;tianity by tho&s;e of other religions, is not the effect of chri&s;tiani|ty, but of oppo&s;ition to it; and the per&s;ecuting &s;pirit which has appeared in &s;ome chri&s;tians, is not the effect of chri&s;tianity, but of the abu&s;e and perver&s;ion of it; and for neither of the&s;e is chri&s;tianity it&s;elf an&s;werable. The be&s;t in&s;titu|tion in the world may be oppo&s;ed and per&s;ecu|ted; and the be&s;t in&s;titution in the world may be abu&s;ed and perverted. But chri&s;tianity nev|er

gave any ju&s;t occa&s;ion for either the per&s;ecu|tion or perver&s;ion of it&s;elf.</P>
<P>BESIDES, the charge of per&s;ecution may ju&s;tly be retorted. For no &s;ooner did chri&s;tianity make its appearance in the world, than it was violent|ly oppo&s;ed and virulently per&s;ecuted, by tho&s;e very heathens, who in the objection now before us are &s;aid not to have been guilty of per&s;ecution. And as long as they had the power in their hands, this oppo&s;ition was continued or repeat|ed, under various Roman Emperors, for ten &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive and bloody per&s;ecutions, in which thou|&s;ands and hundreds of thou&s;ands were martyred in various ways, the mo&s;t malicious and cruel.</P>
<P>NAY, the heathens &s;howed a di&s;po&s;ition to per&s;ecute not only chri&s;tians, but one another, whenever there was opportunity. No &s;ooner did Socrates oppo&s;e the religion and polythei&s;m of his countrymen, than they began a per&s;ecu|tion of him, which ended in his death. And Camby&s;es, the Per&s;ian monarch, in contempt of the Egyptian god Apis, not only &s;tabbed him with his dagger, but ordered the prie&s;ts of Apis to be &s;everely whipped, and all the inhabitants of Memphis to be &s;lain, who &s;hould be found re|joicing on the occa&s;ion of the appearance of that god.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prideaux's connection.</NOTE> The&s;e things demon&s;trate, that the an|cient heathens did po&s;&s;e&s;s an high degree of the &s;pirit of per&s;ecution, and not only toward the chri&s;tians, but toward one another.

<P>THE facts concerning Socrates and Camby&s;es, furni&s;h an an&s;wer to that part of the objection under con&s;ideration, which urges that chri&s;tians per&s;ecute not only heathens, but one another; whereas heathens did not per&s;ecute one another. It appears by the facts ju&s;t mentioned, that hea|thens have per&s;ecuted one another. Be&s;ides, the &s;ame rea&s;on is to be a&s;&s;igned for chri&s;tians per&s;ecuting one another, as for the heathens per&s;ecuting chri&s;tians. The prote&s;tants &s;ay, that the religion of the papi&s;ts is fundamentally wrong; on the other hand, the papi&s;ts a&s;&s;ert the &s;ame concerning the prote&s;tants. Thus by a mutual renunciation, condemnation and ex|communication of each other, the fal&s;e zeal of the&s;e and other different &s;ects among chri&s;tians is kindled into per&s;ecution, on the &s;ame grounds on which per&s;ecution is begun and carried on, be|tween chri&s;tians and heathens. But by rea&s;on of the forementioned intercommunity of gods and religions among the antient heathens, the&s;e grounds of per&s;ecution did not exi&s;t among them in general, though in &s;ome ca&s;es they did both exi&s;t and produce their u&s;ual fruits.</P>

brought again&s;t chri&s;tianity, that vice is more prevalent among chri&s;tians, than it was among the antient heathens.</P>
<P>CHRISTIANS indeed have no virtue to be the ground of boa&s;ting; on the other hand they have great rea&s;on to be a&s;hamed and humbled on account of their vices and their depravity of manners. Still I maintain, that open vice is not &s;o prevalent in chri&s;tian nations, as it was among the antient heathens. Let us compare tho&s;e an|tient heathens, of whom we know the mo&s;t and who were the mo&s;t improved and polite, with the chri&s;tians of whom we know the mo&s;t; the antient Greeks and Romans with the citi|zens of the United States.</P>
<P>HERE it is to be ob&s;erved, that we labour un|der great di&s;advantage. We know our own country and its predominant vices, both public and private. In order to this we need but open our eyes and look around us. We have not the &s;ame advantage to know the antients. We are entirely dependent on hi&s;tory for information concerning them and their vices; and this gene|rally relates the public tran&s;actions of nations on|ly, as their wars and treaties, their laws and pub|lic judgments; but is mo&s;tly &s;ilent concerning the morals and private lives of individuals or of the people con&s;idered collectively; and &s;o far as we are ignorant of the antients we have no right to charge them with vice. However, with all this di&s;advantage, I fear not to proceed to the compari&s;on.</P>
<P>LET us then in&s;titute the compari&s;on with re&s;|pect to the principal moral virtues, as tempe|rance, cha&s;tity, truth, ju&s;tice and humanity.</P>

1. As to temperance; though this was reck|oned among the virtues by the pagan moral writers, yet it is plain from their writers in gen|eral, that drunkenne&s;s was exceedingly common among them, and among all ranks, among ma|gi&s;trates, philo&s;ophers and prie&s;ts, as well as oth|ers. Their prie&s;ts in &s;ome of their religious fea&s;ts were always intoxicated. Even Cato, though a Stoic philo&s;opher, one of their &s;trict|e&s;t morali&s;ts and a principal magi&s;trate, was re|markably addicted to this vice. So was Zeno, the founder of the &s;ect of the Stoics; and Chry|&s;ippus, another Stoic philo&s;opher died in con&s;e|quence of exce&s;&s;ive drinking at a &s;acrifice.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prie&s;tley's In&s;titutes.</NOTE> The character of their principal magi&s;trates, prie&s;ts and philo&s;ophers, does not appear to have &s;uffered much, if at all, by this vice. It mu&s;t therefore have been con&s;idered by the peo|ple, as a very venial fault, if any at all. Indeed this is evident by all their writers. But how it is e&s;teemed among us, and what would be the effect of it on the reputation of our principal ma|gi&s;trates and divines, I need not inform you.</P>
<P N="2">2. As to cha&s;tity, it is manife&s;t from the whole current of pagan writers, that they con&s;idered fornication as no crime, and therefore ran into it without re&s;erve. Not only is this ob&s;ervable of Homer's heroes, but even the mode&s;t Virgil's pious Eneas, who was meant to be a perfect character, had an amour with Dido, without the lea&s;t &s;hame or &s;en&s;e of indecency. Simple fornication was not only commonly practi|&s;ed without re&s;traint; but was allowed by all their philo&s;ophers, and was po&s;itively encourag|ed

by &s;ome of them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"None of the philo&s;ophers ever repre&s;ented &s;imple forni|cation, e&s;pecially on the part of the man, as any vice at all. Ca|to commended a young man for frequenting the public &s;tews; and Cicero expre&s;sly &s;peaks of it, as a thing that was never found fault with." <HI>Prie&s;tley's In&s;titutes.</HI> All that was enjoin|ed by Epictetus, who of all the philo&s;ophers, is perhaps the mo&s;t celebrated for his &s;trict maxims of morality, was, "that peo|ple &s;hould ab&s;tain from fornication before marriage as far as they could; and that if they did not ab&s;tain, they &s;hould u&s;e it lawfully, and not be &s;evere in reprehending tho&s;e who did not ab&s;tain." Enchiridion, Chap. 47.</NOTE> Many of the cu&s;toms of the Greeks and Romans promoted lewdne&s;s. The manner of the appearance of women in &s;ome of their public exerci&s;es, was &s;uch as directly ten|ded to that vice; and the ideas of the lawful|ne&s;s and expediency of a community of wives &s;o far prevailed and had &s;uch an influence on practice, as not only implied the violation of cha&s;tity, but had a mo&s;t baleful general tenden|cy with re&s;pect to that virtue.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">"At Sparta, young women appeared naked in the public exerci&s;es; and when married women had no children, their hu&s;bands were encouraged to con&s;ent to a free intercour&s;e be|tween them and other men; a cu&s;tom which Plutarch vin|dicates. This was al&s;o agreeable to the doctrine of the Sto|ics; and it is well known, that that rigid Stoic, Cato of Utica, con&s;ented to &s;uch an intercour&s;e between his own wife and his friend Horten&s;ius. Plato in his book of laws, recommends a community of women; and he advi&s;es, that &s;oldiers be not re|&s;trained with re&s;pect to any kind of &s;inful indulgence, even the mo&s;t unnatural &s;pecies of it, when they are on an expedition, <HI>Prie&s;tly.</HI></NOTE> Though it is hardly credible, yet unnatural vices had too much the &s;anction of &s;ome legi&s;lators and philo|&s;ophers, and were countenanced by many of them. Xenophon informs us, that the &s;in of Sodom was encouraged by the public laws of &s;everal of the &s;tates of Greece. It was more e&s;|pecially &s;o among the Cretans, in order to pre|vent too great an increa&s;e of the people. Solon, one of the &s;even wi&s;e men of Greece, and the celebrated law-giver of Athens, forbad this prac|tice

to &s;laves, which nece&s;&s;arily conveys the idea of his thinking it fit for free men only. Accor|ding to Cicero, the Greek philo&s;ophers not on|ly generally practi&s;ed, but even gloried in this vice: And Plutarch informs us, that many parents would not &s;uffer their children to keep the com|pany of tho&s;e philo&s;ophers, who pretended to be fond of them. Diogenes was remarkable for in|dulging him&s;elf in the mo&s;t abominable practices openly, and without a &s;en&s;e of &s;hame; affecting, according to the maxim of the Cynics, to live according to nature.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Does not the forementioned dei&s;tic maxim of following nature, directly lead to the &s;ame abominable practices?</NOTE> The&s;e unnatural vices were increa&s;ed in a mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing manner, about the time of the promulgation of chri&s;tiani|ty.

<P N="3">3. Truth is a moral virtue, the obligation and nece&s;&s;ity of which are perhaps as evident as tho&s;e of any virtue whatever.

<P N="4">4. LET us inquire how far ju&s;tice was main|tained
<PB N="25" REF="026934_0024_0FD26D0B2A6EA3F0">
and practi&s;ed among the antients. I now mean ju&s;tice in matters of property. For that kind of ju&s;tice which is oppo&s;ed to oppre&s;&s;ion and cruelty, will come into view, when we &s;hall con&s;ider the humanity of the antients. It is well known to have been a maxim at Sparta, that probity and every thing el&s;e was to be &s;acri|ficed to the good of the &s;tate. The Spartans encouraged their children to &s;teal, but puni&s;hed tho&s;e who were taken in the fact, as not being dextrous in the bu&s;ine&s;s. "We may judge of the &s;tate of Greece, with re&s;pect to the kind of ju&s;tice of which we are now &s;peaking, from that pa&s;&s;age in a dialogue of Xenophon&mdash;in which he humourou&s;ly &s;hows the advantages of poverty and the inconveniencies of riches; and by what Tacitus &s;ays, that the temples were full of debt|ors and criminals, as churches and mona&s;teries u&s;ed formerly to be in Popi&s;h countries. Rome and the neighbourhood of it, in the mo&s;t intere&s;t|ing period of its hi&s;tory, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> in the time of Cice|ro, abounded with robbers. Sallu&s;t &s;ays, that Cataline's army was much augmented by the ac|ce&s;&s;ion of highwaymen about Rome. Cicero ob&s;erved, that had Milo killed Clodius by night, it might have been imagined, that he had been killed by highwaymen, and that the frequency of &s;uch accidents would have favoured the &s;up|po&s;ition, though he had with him thirty &s;laves completely armed and accu&s;tomed to blood and danger. By the law of the twelve tables, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion for two years formed a pre&s;cription for land, and of one year for moveables; an evident mark of frequent violences, when &s;uch a law was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure a title to property."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prie&s;tley's letters on general policy.</NOTE> How

different our &s;ituation is from this, and how much more &s;ecure our per&s;ons and property are, I need not mention in this auditory.</P>
<P N="5">5. WE proceed now to inquire how far the antient heathens practi&s;ed the duties of humani|ty, and how far they violated tho&s;e duties by outrage, oppre&s;&s;ion and cruelty. The Stoics condemned all compa&s;&s;ion. No wonder then that they imbibed and practi&s;ed inhumanity. Some philo&s;ophers, particularly Democritus, recommended revenge; and Plato owns that for|givene&s;s of injuries was contrary to the general doctrine of the philo&s;ophers. The&s;e ideas &s;eem perfectly to coincide with tho&s;e among the mod|erns, who are the great advocates for a &s;en&s;e of honour. And how far the&s;e ideas are con&s;i&s;t|ent with &s;cripture, with rea&s;on or with humani|ty, I leave you to judge.</P>
<P>IT was common with the Romans to make war on other nations for the end of enlarging their own dominions, and aggrandizing their empire. Generally they had no better motive to their wars than this. But what is &s;uch a war, but a complication of downright robbery, cru|elty and murder? They practi&s;ed equal inju&s;tice in the manner in which they carried on their wars. They en&s;laved their captives or put them to death in cold blood, as they plea&s;ed. Their triumphs were mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive and cruel. The conquered kings and generals, loaded with chains, were driven into the city, and to the capitol before their conquerors, and were fol|lowed by mimicks and buffoons, who in&s;ulted over their misfortunes. When they arrived at the forum, they were led back to pri&s;on and
<PB N="27" REF="026934_0026_0FD26D126FC2BAF8">
there &s;trangled; and this under the pretence of taking full revenge of their enemies. What better is this, than the treatment which our &s;av|age Indians give their captives?</P>
<P>THE treatment which they gave tho&s;e cap|tives who&s;e lives they &s;pared, was corre&s;pondent to this cruelty toward tho&s;e whom they put to death. As has been ob&s;erved, they ab&s;olutely en&s;laved them; and by law, &s;laves were confid|ed not as men, but as mere things, the mere property of their ma&s;ters, and were treated, puni&s;hed, and put to death at any time and in any manner, as their ma&s;ters plea&s;ed, whether by beating, &s;tarving, torture, or otherwi&s;e. "The Spartans having conquered a neighbour|ing nation, the Helots, en&s;laved them, frequent|ly butchered them in cold blood, and applau|ded their youths, when they killed them by &s;ur|pri&s;e." "The Romans were not a&s;hamed to &s;uffer their old and u&s;ele&s;s &s;laves, when worn out in their &s;ervice, to &s;tarve on an i&s;land in the Ty|ber, as was their common practice.

<P>THOUGH to our &s;hame, to the &s;hame of hu|manity and the &s;candal of chri&s;tianity, a &s;lavery and a treatment of &s;laves &s;imilar to what exi&s;ted among the Romans, exi&s;t and are tolerated in &s;ome parts of America; yet this &s;candal cannot be thrown on chri&s;tendom in general. Such a &s;lavery did indeed once generally obtain in Eu|rope; but the benevolent and humane &s;pirit of the go&s;pel and the principles of ju&s;tice taught
<PB N="28" REF="026934_0027_0FD26D149E9D8A28">
there, have long &s;ince generally aboli&s;hed it from that quarter of the world.</P>
<P>THE pro&s;criptions and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations, which were &s;o common among the antients, are a fur|ther proof of their inju&s;tice, violence and inhu|manity. It is well known that during the conte&s;ts of Marius and Sylla, and during the triumvirate of Octavianus, Anthony and Lepidus, nothing was more common than to adverti&s;e a certain price for any man's or any number of men's heads; which was no other than hiring any cut-throat, and even a man's own dome&s;tics, to murder him and bring in his head. In this way the be&s;t men of Rome were murdered, and among the re&s;t Cicero the great orator, philo&s;opher and ornament of Rome. Amid&s;t all the vices ju&s;tly imputable to chri&s;tians, they are not guilty of &s;uch barbarity and outrage as this. Such is the &s;alutary influence of chri&s;tianity, that even kings, who among the antients no &s;ooner fell into the hands of their rivals or oppo&s;ers, than they were a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, are now not put to death without a formal trial; which is a clear demon&s;tration among many others, of our im|provement in civilization and humanity, beyond any thing which exi&s;ted among the mo&s;t enlight|ened heathens.</P>
<P>ANOTHER in&s;tance of the barbarity and inhu|manity of the antients, is their treatment of their children. "The antient Roman laws gave the father a power of life and death over his chil|dren, upon this principle, that he who gave, had al&s;o the power to take away. And a &s;on could not acquire any property of his own du|ring the life of his father; but all his acqui&s;itions
<PB N="29" REF="026934_0028_0FD26D182CDB0C28">
belonged to his father, or at lea&s;t the profits, for life."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Black&s;tone.</NOTE> Thus children, during the life of their fathers, were perfect &s;laves, and in a wor&s;e condition than the &s;laves in this &s;tate; for the ma&s;ter in this &s;tate has not the power of life and death over his &s;laves. Nor were the&s;e mere &s;peculations of the Romans; but their practice was corre&s;pondent. Hence the cu&s;tom of expo|&s;ing children; that is, of laying them, as &s;oon as born, in the &s;treets, on the banks of rivers, or in other frequented places, and unle&s;s &s;ome compa&s;&s;ionate per&s;on &s;hould take them up and provide for them, leaving them there to peri&s;h and to be devoured by dogs. The motive to this horrid practice was, that the parents might be free from the trouble and expence of their education. Both Plato and Ari&s;totle &s;ay, that there &s;hould be laws to prevent the education of weak children. Accordingly among the other Greeks, be&s;ide the Thebans, when a child was born, it was laid on the ground, and if the fath|er de&s;igned to educate it, he immediately took it up. But if he forbore to do this, the child was carried away and expo&s;ed. The Lacede|monians indeed had a different cu&s;tom; for with them all new born children were brought before certain triers, who were &s;ome of the grave&s;t men in their own tribes, by whom the infants were carefully viewed; and if they were found lu&s;ty and well favoured, they gave orders for their education; but if weakly and deform|ed, they ordered them to be ca&s;t into a deep ca|vern in the earth, near the mountain Taygetus, as thinking it neither for the good of the chil|dren nor for the public intere&s;t, that defective children &s;hould be brought up. It was the un|happy

<P>IN &s;everal nations, not only infants, but al&s;o the aged and the infirm, were expo&s;ed and left to peri&s;h.</P>
<P>ANOTHER horrid inhumanity, prevalent a|mong the antient heathens, was the practice of &s;acrificing captives and &s;laves at the funerals of the dead. Thus Achilles &s;acrificed twelve young Trojans to the manes of Patroclus; and Eneas &s;ent captives to Evander, to be &s;acrificed at the fu|neral of Pallas. This was fir&s;t practi&s;ed with re&s;|pect to per&s;ons of great eminence only, but at length it was done at the funerals of all per&s;ons of property, and became a nece&s;&s;ary part of the ceremony.</P>
<P>ANOTHER practice as horrid as any I have mentioned, was that of exhibiting gladiators trained to fencing and the u&s;e of the &s;word, &s;pear, &amp;c. on purpo&s;e that they might fight and kill one another on the &s;tage, for the mere entertain|ment of the &s;pectators, as &s;ome people now bait bulls and &s;et dogs to fighting.

No wonder if under &s;uch in&s;tructors and
<PB N="32" REF="026934_0031_0FD26D1E03AE6200">
&s;uch examples, &s;uicide was very common among the antients. Be&s;ide the wickedne&s;s of this in the &s;ight of God, the ruinous tendency of it in a political view is manife&s;t on the &s;light|e&s;t reflection. By this one vice not only any man may deprive the &s;tate of his aid and throw his family and dependents on the public; but the mo&s;t important citizens, by throwing away their own lives in the mo&s;t important and criti|cal moment, may greatly endanger and entire|ly overthrow the commonwealth. What if our <HI>Wa&s;hington,</HI> or the mo&s;t wi&s;e and influential mem|bers of our Congre&s;s, had de&s;troyed them&s;elves in the mo&s;t critical periods of the late war?</P>
<P>FROM this brief &s;urvey of the vices of the an|tient heathens, I leave my hearers to judge how well founded the objection again&s;t chri&s;tianity is, that it has depraved the morals of mankind.</P>
<P>I HAVE now fini&s;hed the ob&s;ervations which I intended, on the &s;ubject propo&s;ed, which was, The nece&s;&s;ity of a belief of chri&s;tianity by the ci|tizens of this &s;tate, in order to our public and political pro&s;perity. In &s;ub&s;erviency to this general de&s;ign I have endeavoured to &s;how, that &s;ome religion is nece&s;&s;ary to our political pro&s;|perity; that no other religion than the chri&s;|tian, can be generally received and e&s;tabli&s;hed in this country; and that if &s;ome other religion could be e&s;tabli&s;hed among us, it would by no means be &s;o u&s;eful in a political view, as the chri&s;tian. I have endeavoured to illu&s;trate the la&s;t ob&s;ervation by a compari&s;on of chri&s;tianity with the philo&s;ophical religion of infidelity and with antient pagani&s;m. I now beg leave to make two or three inferences from what has been &s;aid.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="026934_0032_0FD26D2151FD9F10">
I. IF chri&s;tianity be more u&s;eful than any other religion, even for political purpo&s;es, we may pre&s;ume that it is &s;till more u&s;eful for the other purpo&s;es, which are indeed its immediate objects, piety and true virtue, and peace and comfort in them. The great foundations of re|ligion and virtue are, the moral perfections of God, his moral government, the rule of our du|ty, a future &s;tate of retribution, the po&s;&s;ibility of pardon and the end of our creation. Let us in the&s;e &s;everal particulars compare chri&s;tianity with the philo&s;ophical religion, which is the on|ly rival of chri&s;tianity with any among us.</P>
<P N="1">1. AS to the moral perfections of God, chri&s;tian|ity certainly teaches them more clearly than they can be learnt from any light afforded by the philo|&s;ophical religion. The &s;criptures a&s;&s;ure us, that holy, holy, holy is the Lord of ho&s;ts; that he is a God of truth and without iniquity, ju&s;t and right is he; that he is the Lord, the Lord God mer|ciful and gracious, long &s;uffering, and abundant in goodne&s;s and truth, keeping mercy for thou|&s;ands, forgiving iniquity and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and &s;in, and that will by no means clear the guilty. Yea, they a&s;&s;ure us, that God is love. They clear up the difficulty ari&s;ing from the evil in the world, by informing us of the end of all things, and that all things &s;hall finally be overrul|ed for good. But the philo&s;ophical religion gives no clear evidence at all of the moral perfections of God. This is acknowledged by &s;ome of the principal writers on that &s;y&s;tem. <HI>Hume,</HI> the mo&s;t acute of all infidels, &s;ays we ought to in|fer from the works of God, intermixed as they are with good and evil, that God is of a mixed
<PB N="34" REF="026934_0033_0FD26D24B49E8CF0">
character, partly good and partly evil. Al&s;o Lord Bolingbroke, another principal dei&s;tical writer, holds, that there is no evidence of the moral perfections of God.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE like advantage have we by the &s;crip|tures as to the evidence of the reality and nature of the moral government of God. On the pre|tence that we are under the influence of a ne|ce&s;&s;ity of coaction, it is denied by &s;ome infidels that we are moral agents, and that we are ca|pable of either virtue or vice. Now not only is this matter cleared up by revelation, but it is to be ob&s;erved, that to be con&s;i&s;tent, &s;uch infi|dels ought al&s;o to deny, that we are capable of any crime in civil &s;ociety.</P>
<P>IF we be not moral agents, we are no more capable of murder, than a &s;tock or a &s;tone; and a man who from malice prepen&s;e kills another, no more de&s;erves puni&s;hment, than the &s;tone or the tree, which falls on a man and cru&s;hes him to death; and the man who from a wi&s;h to in|troduce and e&s;tabli&s;h arbitrary government in his country, now a free and happy republic, betrays its &s;hips and fortre&s;&s;es, no more de&s;erves puni&s;h|ment, than the tempe&s;ts which &s;ink the former, or the fire which con&s;umes the latter.</P>
<P>SOME deny, that God at all concerns him&s;elf with human affairs or actions. But this is not only not reconcileable with the &s;criptures, but not with the moral perfections of God. If we be capable of virtue, and yet he neglect us, &s;o as not to &s;et before us proper motives to it, and not to &s;how by proper rewards and puni&s;hments his approbation of the virtuous, and di&s;appro|bation
<PB N="35" REF="026934_0034_0FD26D26628ED510">
of the vicious; this cannot be reconciled with his moral perfection.</P>
<P>IT is further urged, that we are not in any ca&s;e puni&s;hable, as all things are right, or as the poet expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>whatever is, is right.</HI> If by this ob&s;ervation be meant, that things are by the all-wi&s;e and all-governing providence of God, overruled to an&s;wer a good purpo&s;e, though in many in&s;tances directly contrary to their natural tendency; this is granted. But if it be meant, that all things in their own nature tend to good, this is not true. Malice has no natural tenden|cy to good but a natural tendency to evil. On the other hand, benevolence has a natural ten|dency to good. Nor will it be pretended, that if malice reigned through the univer&s;e, the uni|ver&s;e would be as happy, as if benevolence univer&s;ally reigned. It is the natural tendency of a rational action, which determines its moral quality, and not the con&s;equence produced by Almighty God, contrary to its natural tendency.</P>
<P>IF all human actions were in a moral view indifferent, we &s;hould no more de&s;erve puni&s;h|ment for murder, than we &s;hould for &s;aving our country from ruin.</P>
<P>THIS &s;cheme &s;huts all moral <HI>good</HI> out of the univer&s;e, as well as all moral evil. For if all the tempers and actions of men, are as to mo|rality alike, it mu&s;t be becau&s;e there is no mo|rality in any of them. If there be moral good in any of tho&s;e tempers or actions, there mu&s;t be moral evil in the directly oppo&s;ite; and if there be no moral evil in the latter, there is no moral good in the former: as if there were no
<PB N="36" REF="026934_0035_0FD26D2964595BE0">
natural evil in pain there would be no na|tural good in plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>BUT while infidels confound them&s;elves and the principles of rea&s;on, in their di&s;cour&s;es con|cerning the moral government of God; the &s;criptures a&s;&s;ure us of the reality of that govern|ment, and of our accountablene&s;s to God.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE &s;criptures give us a plain and excel|lent rule of duty, pointing out our duty not only in general, but in all the mo&s;t important particu|lars. How extremely deficient in this in&s;tance al&s;o, is the philo&s;ophical religion? It is indeed &s;aid, that the rule of our duty is right rea&s;on and the law of nature, and that virtue is a con|formity to them. But this is &s;aying no more than that virtue is virtue, and that the rule of our duty is the rule of our duty. For right rea&s;on in this ca&s;e means what is rea&s;onable and right in a moral &s;en&s;e; and duty and what is right in a moral &s;en&s;e are the &s;ame thing: and it is ju&s;t as difficult to find out the law of rea&s;on and of nature, as to find out our duty.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE &s;criptures give us the mo&s;t po&s;itive a&s;&s;urance of a future &s;tate. But the philo&s;ophi|cal religion can never a&s;&s;ure us of this, becau&s;e it cannot a&s;&s;ure us of the moral perfections of God, by which alone he is di&s;po&s;ed to reward the righteous and puni&s;h the wicked. Therefore in|fidels are greatly divided among them&s;elves on this &s;ubject. Some as was before ob&s;erved be|lieve a future &s;tate, &s;ome di&s;believe it. Tho&s;e who believe &s;uch a &s;tate, believe that God made all men for their own per&s;onal happine&s;s, and that therefore he will make them all happy in
<PB N="37" REF="026934_0036_0FD26D2F05D28638">
the future world. But all this depends on the moral perfections of God, of which they, as their principal writers confe&s;s, have no evidence. And if there be no evidence of God's moral per|fections, there is no evidence, that he de&s;igns the happine&s;s of his creatures either here or hereaf|ter: nor is there any evidence but that he de|&s;igns the final <HI>mi&s;ery</HI> of all his creatures.&mdash;Or if infidels had evidence of the moral perfections of God, they would not have evidence, that God made every man for the end of his per&s;on|al happine&s;s. The perfect goodne&s;s of God doubtle&s;s implies, that he made all things with a de&s;ign to promote good on the whole or on the large &s;cale. So that taking the &s;y&s;tem of intelligent creatures together, there &s;hall be the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible happine&s;s in it. But this does not imply, that every individual creature &s;hall be completely happy. There is no account|ing for the calamities and &s;ufferings of this life on any other &s;uppo&s;ition, than that they will all finally i&s;&s;ue in the greate&s;t happine&s;s of the &s;y&s;|tem: and to &s;uppo&s;e that they conduce to the good of the &s;y&s;tem, by making the per&s;ons them|&s;elves who &s;uffer them here, more happy hereaf|ter, is a mere conjecture un&s;uppored by any ar|gument. Therefore to indulge it and to build upon it, is altogether unrea&s;onable and unphi|lo&s;ophical.</P>
<P>ON the whole, there is no evidence but that the good of the general &s;y&s;tem may be promo|ted by the exemplary puni&s;hment of the wicked in the future world. And if it would be promo|ted by &s;uch a puni&s;hment, infinite goodne&s;s not only admits of it, but requires and demands it.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="38" REF="026934_0037_0FD26D32EF8786B8">
5. THE &s;criptures a&s;&s;ure us of a way of par|don and acceptance with God; but the philo|&s;ophical religion gives no &s;uch a&s;&s;urance. Infi|dels do indeed expect to be pardoned on their bare repentance. But the expectation of <HI>pardon</HI> on repentance, implies an acknowledgment, that they de&s;erve puni&s;hment even though they re|pent, and that &s;uch puni&s;hment would be ju&s;t: otherwi&s;e there could be no <HI>pardon</HI> in the ca&s;e. To pardon is to exempt from puni&s;hment not an innocent man, but a guilty one: and to par|don a penitent implies that he de&s;erves puni&s;h|ment, and that his puni&s;hment would be ju&s;t. But if the puni&s;hment of the penitent would be ju&s;t, the intere&s;t of the kingdom of God, the great community again&s;t which he has &s;inned, requires his puni&s;hment. The very idea of a ju&s;t puni&s;hment is of one which, (there being no atonement or &s;ub&s;titution,) is due to the commu|nity or to the public good of the community, again&s;t which the crime puni&s;hed was commit|ted. But if the public good of God's kingdom, which is the univer&s;e, require the puni&s;hment of the &s;inner, it is not con&s;i&s;tent with divine goodne&s;s to pardon him. What ground then has the infidel to expect pardon, when both ju&s;tice and goodne&s;s require his puni&s;hment?</P>
<P N="6">6. CHRISTIANITY informs us of the end of our creation. It is generally holden by infidels, as was before ob&s;erved, that we were made for our own per&s;onal happine&s;s. But if this were true, it would prove, that God does concern him&s;elf with human actions, and that he aims to prevent tho&s;e which tend to our de&s;truction. It would al&s;o prove, that tho&s;e rational actions which tend to de&s;troy our happine&s;s, are mor|ally
<PB N="39" REF="026934_0038_0FD26D34B94D2C98">
evil, and that all actions are not in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e right. The evidence that God created us for our own happine&s;s, mu&s;t depend on the evidence of God's moral perfections. But as has been ob&s;erved, the infidel has no evidence of the&s;e. Be&s;ides, if God really created us all for the end of our own per&s;onal happine&s;s, it &s;eems that he has in this world obtained his end, in a very imperfect degree only; and on the plan of infidelity there is no evidence of a future &s;tate. Therefore on that plan there is no evi|dence, that God will ever obtain his end in our creation.</P>
<P>OR if infidels &s;hould grant, that we were made for the general good of the &s;y&s;tem of in|telligences, this would be to give up the chief object of infidelity; becau&s;e the general good may admit of our mi&s;ery in the future world, as it does of our mi&s;ery in this.</P>
<P>BUT chri&s;tianity clearly informs us, that God made all things for his glory, implying the grea|te&s;t happine&s;s and perfection of the creation as a &s;y&s;tem; or for the glorious exerci&s;e and di&s;|play of his power, wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s in rai&s;|ing his kingdom, which is the creation, as a &s;y&s;|tem, to the highe&s;t degree of perfection and hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>THUS we &s;ee in what darkne&s;s, as to the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential principles of religion, we &s;hould have been involved, had we not been favoured with the light of divine revelation, and in what dark|ne&s;s they are involved, who embrace the philo|&s;ophical religion of infidelity. And thus we have further proof how happy that people is,
<PB N="40" REF="026934_0039_0FD26D362BA47858">
who&s;e God is the Lord, not only as this cir|cum&s;tance lays a foundation for their political good, but e&s;pecially as it lays a foundation for true virtue and piety, for peace and com|fort here and eternal happine&s;s in the favour of God hereafter.</P>
<P N="2">2. A SECOND inference from this &s;ubject is, that &s;ince chri&s;tianity appears to be nece&s;&s;ary to the public good of the &s;tate, it ought to be en|couraged by magi&s;trates and rulers of every de&s;cription. They are appointed to be the guardians of the public good; of cour&s;e it is their duty to protect and promote every thing tending to it, and e&s;pecially every thing nece&s;|&s;ary to it. Therefore as chri&s;tianity is nece&s;&s;a|ry to the public good, they are bound to encou|rage, promote and inculcate that, by their exam|ple and profe&s;&s;ion, by &s;peaking and acting in favour of it both in public and private, by &s;up|porting chri&s;tian ordinances and wor&s;hip, and by promoting to places of tru&s;t and profit tho&s;e who profe&s;s it and live agreeably, and who are otherwi&s;e properly qualified. Magi&s;trates are called to do all this on the ground of the &s;ound|e&s;t policy.</P>
<P N="3">3. FOR the &s;ame rea&s;ons the citizens in gene|ral are obligated to encourage and promote chri&s;tianity, by being them&s;elves chri&s;tians and that not only in profe&s;&s;ion, but in heart and life, and by giving their &s;uffrages for tho&s;e who are of the &s;ame character. It is indeed to be confe&s;&s;ed, that not all profe&s;&s;ed chri&s;tians are good men or real chri&s;tians; yet among pro|fe&s;&s;ed chri&s;tians are many men, who po&s;&s;e&s;s good abilities and a proper &s;hare of informati|on,
<PB N="41" REF="026934_0040_0FD26D379F2937F8">
who are &s;trictly moral and upright, and who expect to give an account of their conduct to God. Such are the men to be promoted in the &s;tate; and the citizens by promoting &s;uch men, will encourage and promote chri&s;tianity, and at the &s;ame time promote the good of the &s;tate.</P>

Oppo&s;ition to chri&s;tianity both in faith and practice was never, at lea&s;t in our country, &s;o great and &s;o increa&s;ing, as at the pre&s;ent day. It lies with you, gentlemen, by a &s;teady belief, profe&s;&s;ion and practice of chri&s;tian|ity; by your conver&s;ation and weight; by the appointments which you &s;hall make to the vari|ous offices, civil and military, and by all your public proceedings, to with&s;tand this oppo&s;ition, and to guard again&s;t the danger to the public good, ari&s;ing from the depravity of manners which oppo&s;ition to chri&s;tianity naturally indu|ces. It is your province, in conjunction with his Excellency the Governour, to appoint all our executive civil authority and to confer the high|er military honours.

<P>WE who are employed in the work of the mini&s;try, are deeply intere&s;ted in this &s;ubject. We are intere&s;ted in the pro&s;perity of the &s;tate, and are peculiarly intere&s;ted in this mean of pro&s;perity on which I have been in&s;i&s;ting. It is our bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;tudy and teach chri&s;tianity, and thus to promote the political good of the &s;tate, as well as the &s;piritual good of the &s;ouls of our hearers. This is a noble employment, to fidel|ity and zeal in which, not only the motives of religion call us, but even tho&s;e of patrioti&s;m. Therefore if we have any love to religion and the &s;ouls of men; nay if we have any public &s;pirit and love to our country, let us diligently &s;tudy the evidences, the nature, the doctrines
<PB N="45" REF="026934_0044_0FD26D423927D218">
and duties of chri&s;tianity, and inculcate them with all plainne&s;s, a&s;&s;iduity and per&s;everance, giving line upon line and precept upon precept. This is to be done,</P>
<P N="1">1. BY in&s;truction. Without communicating in&s;truction and information concerning the truth, we can expect to do nothing in our work to any good purpo&s;e. Knowledge and not ig|norance is the mother of real devotion. The rational mind is to be led by the exhibition of the truth only.</P>
<P N="2">2. BY every motive to per&s;uade, drawn from rea&s;on and revelation, from time and eternity; and among others this motive of the public good of the &s;tate and our general happine&s;s, liberty and pro&s;perity as a people, is not to be omitted.</P>
<P N="3">3. BY a chri&s;tian life and conver&s;ation. If we do the&s;e things; if we thus in&s;truct, per|&s;uade and live, we &s;hall at la&s;t &s;tand in our lot, and &s;hall be owned as his, when Chri&s;t our Lord and judge "&s;hall make up his jewels."</P>
<P N="4">4. I SHALL, in the la&s;t place, addre&s;s my&s;elf in a very few words to this numerous auditory collectively. Men and brethren, this &s;ubject nearly concerns you all. How happy would you be, if the Lord were indeed your God? Nor can you be truly happy on any other con|dition. However pro&s;perous you may be in your private concerns, in your property, your bu&s;ine&s;s and your reputation; yet unle&s;s you are the objects of the favour of God and the heirs of eternal life, you are truly in a mi&s;erable
<PB N="46" REF="026934_0045_0FD26D4470930F00">
&s;ituation. You have not only the motive of eternal happine&s;s to choo&s;e the Lord for your God; but the motives of the peace, good order, and happine&s;s of the people as a body politic, and the general pro&s;perity of the &s;tate. You all feel a firm attachment to your liberties and to the priv|ileges of a republican government. Of all forms of government a republic mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially re|quires virtue and good morals in the great body of the people, in order to its pro&s;perity and even its exi&s;tence. But the way to virtue and good morals is to choo&s;e the Lord for your God. Nor is this all; you not only have to choo&s;e and &s;erve the Lord your&s;elves, but by the &s;ame rea&s;ons by which you are obligated to choo&s;e the Lord for your God, you are obligated to &s;eek out and by your &s;uffrages to promote to legi&s;lative authority, &s;uch as are of the &s;ame character. In a republic all authority is derived from the people: and &s;uch as they generally are, we may expect their repre&s;entatives, legi&s;|lators and all their civil authority will be. If you have the Lord for your God, you will elect tho&s;e of the &s;ame character with your&s;elves, to to be your legi&s;lators; you will encourage and &s;upport them and other faithful rulers in the thorough di&s;charge of their duties of civil gov|ernment, and you will withhold your &s;uffrages from tho&s;e who acknowledge not the Lord as their God and regard not his law. Nor can you con&s;i&s;tently and innocently give your &s;uf|frages to men of this la&s;t di&s;cription: for thus you would give a &s;anction and influence to &s;in and vice, would be partakers of their wicked|ne&s;s and would do an injury to the &s;tate.</P>
<P>BUT if you and the good people of the &s;tate
<PB N="47" REF="026934_0046_0FD26D48E0415EB8">
in general &s;hall unite to practi&s;e virtue and chri&s;tianity, and to promote the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t men among us, we &s;hall doubtle&s;s be that happy people de&s;cribed in the text, and as &s;o many in|&s;tances of our happine&s;s "judgment &s;hall dwell in the wilderne&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s remain in the fruitful field. And the work of righteou&s;|ne&s;s &s;hall be peace, and the effect of righteou&s;|ne&s;s quietne&s;s and a&s;&s;urance for ever."</P>
