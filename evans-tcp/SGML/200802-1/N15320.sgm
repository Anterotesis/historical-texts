<Q><P>Wherefore the Lord &s;aid, fora&s;much as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honor me, but have re|moved their heart far from me, and their fear towards me is taught by the precept of men; therefore behold I will proceed to do a marvelous work among&s;t this people, even a marvelous work and a wonder; for the wi&s;dom of their wi&s;e men &s;hall peri&s;h, and the under&s;tanding of their prudent men &s;hall be hid.</P>

<Q><P>A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land. The pro|phets prophe&s;y fal&s;ly, and the prie&s;ts bear rule by their means, and my people love to have it &s;o; and what will ye do in the end thereof?</P>

<Q><P>I &s;aid, days &s;hould &s;peak, and multitude of years &s;hould teach wi&s;|dom. But there is a &s;pirit in man, and the in&s;piration of the Al|mighty giveth them under&s;tanding.

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION to the friendly READER.</HEAD>
<P>IT was the language formerly to the cho&s;en people of God, that my people have committed two great evils; they have for&s;aken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out ci&s;terns, broken ci&s;terns, that can hold no water. This was ever and anon the complaint of the Lord concerning I&s;rael, from the beginning to the end. The Lord did de|light to beget, nouri&s;h, and bring up that people for him&s;elf; but they were almo&s;t continually revolt|ing from him, and rebelling again&s;t him. He did mighty things for them; but they &s;till forgot him. He redeemed them by his out&s;tretched arm; he fed them, he defended them; but they knew him not, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> i. 3, but decked them&s;elves with the orna|ments which they had from him, and then lift up the heel again&s;t him, <HI>Ezek.</HI> xvi. 7, and <HI>Deut.</HI> xxxii. 15. In plain terms, they got what knowledge they could from him into their own ve&s;&s;els, and then they would &s;et up for them&s;elves, without fre&s;h bubblings up of life from the &s;pring from whence their know|ledge came. The prie&s;ts &s;aid not, where is the Lord? but could handle the law, and teach the knowledge of it, without him; and the prophets could prophe&s;y by another &s;pirit, <HI>Jer.</HI> ii. 8. And thus the Lord God of life lived not in them; but they lived upon &s;uch things as once came from the life; but, being &s;eparated from the &s;pring, were dead, and nouri&s;hed but the dead part in them, the e&s;tranged from God. And thus, though their profe&s;&s;ions were great, and they multiplied prayers, &s;acrifices, and fa&s;ts, and drew nigh to God with their lips, yet their hearts were far from him. They had for&s;aken the fountain; they drank not of the waters of the &s;pring, of the
<PB N="4" REF="019435_0003_0FABAC459586AA78">
rock that followed them; but they drank of the waters of their own ci&s;terns. They &s;et up that know|ledge of the law for their light which they had hew|ed out by their own under&s;tanding, without the &s;pirit that wrote it. This was I&s;rael's error of old&punc; They drank very zealou&s;ly of the waters of the law; but they drank it not from the &s;pring, but out of the ci&s;terns which them&s;elves had hewed.</P>
<P>And as it was thus with I&s;rael of old, &s;o hath it been with I&s;rael &s;ince. The Chri&s;tian I&s;rael hath been always back&s;liding, always forgetting the Lord! Still getting what they could to live of them&s;elves, but refu&s;ing to live on him: Getting what know|ledge they could from the &s;criptures without him; getting what they could from their exerci&s;es and ex|periences; but neglecting the &s;pring of their life. And this I&s;rael al&s;o dies; this I&s;rael likewi&s;e withers, and becomes a &s;corn to the heathen; for though they &s;peak great words of their God, yet they them&s;elves are but as the heathen; uncircumci&s;ed like them, un|acquainted with the virtue and power of life like them; always &s;triving again&s;t &s;in, in that which can|not conquer, and &s;o they al&s;o are &s;laves under their lu&s;ts and corruptions, like the heathen; and know not the truth, which makes free indeed.</P>
<P>Exceeding great hath been the apo&s;tacy of this age! Mighty was the appearance of God inwardly in his people's &s;pirits! Mighty was the appearance of God outwardly in the nation! Many ways and great hopes were there of a thorough reformation. But how &s;ud|denly was the pure &s;pirit of the Lord forgotten, and departed from, and his work overturned both within and without? Inwardly in his people's &s;pirits, and outwardly in the nation, who&s;e revolting was but a type of the inward! And how hath the &s;pirit of the
<PB N="5" REF="019435_0004_0FABAC45F6640AB0">
Lord mourned after his people, often reproving them for their back&s;lidings? But they have been (as I&s;rael of old) like the deaf adder, ju&s;tifying them&s;elves, and complaining again&s;t the witne&s;&s;es of God (as I&s;rael did again&s;t his prophets) who from the Lord te&s;tify again&s;t them. And it cannot be otherwi&s;e; for the dead waters in I&s;rael's hewn ci&s;terns will never agree with the waters of the living fountain, but will with|&s;tand their te&s;timony.</P>
<P>How &s;hall the charmer charm wi&s;ely enough to make apo&s;tate I&s;rael hearken to his voice? I have not back&s;lidden, &s;aith one in one form; I have not back&s;lidden, &s;aith another in another form: I have not back&s;lidden, &s;aith one in one notion; I am not back&s;lidden, &s;aith another in another potion: I am believing, hoping, and waiting in what the Lord hath already revealed, and following on to know him. This hath been thy manner from thy youth, that thou obeyed&s;t not my word; but &s;till have been ju&s;tifying thy&s;elf, as if thou had&s;t obeyed. And yet your back&s;lidings are written upon your foreheads, as with the point of a diamond. For who among you retains his fre&s;hne&s;s? An evident demon&s;tration that ye are departed from the &s;pring, and hold your knowledge, experiences and hopes, in the dead part; and your choice&s;t prop of comfort is the remem|brance of what you once had. Ah! poor, barren, dead &s;ouls, is this your be&s;t &s;upport? Return, re|turn; enter into the hou&s;e of mourning, and let the living lay it to heart.</P>
<P>Now let not men run on in heats again&s;t us; but let them &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider, whether we be of God or no: And let them con&s;ider not with the rea&s;on and under&s;tanding which is alienated from God; but with the witne&s;s which lies hid in the heart. There is
<PB N="6" REF="019435_0005_0FABAC469C411010">
one great palpable argument that we are of God, which is this, all the world is again&s;t us: The worldly part everywhere fights again&s;t us; the world|ly part, in every &s;ort and &s;ect of men, oppo&s;eth us; the rage of men everywhere ri&s;eth up again&s;t us: But tho&s;e that are &s;o hot again&s;t us, if at any time they become but meek and calm, patiently con&s;idering our cau&s;e, and con&s;ulting thereupon with the te&s;timo|ny that they find in their own hearts concerning us, they &s;oon become pacified, and &s;ee that we are no man's enemies, again&s;t no righteous law, not again&s;t relations, not again&s;t governments, not again&s;t any thing in the world that is good, but only again&s;t that which is evil and corrupt. And of a truth, the corrup|tion of things God hath &s;hewn unto us, and daily calls us forth after an immediate manner to witne&s;s again&s;t.</P>
<P>Therefore let men be &s;ober, and take heed what they do, le&s;t they be found fighters again&s;t God; for the reproaches, the &s;coffs, with other per&s;ecu|tions, which &s;eem to be ca&s;t at us, light on him. (Ina&s;much as it is done unto one of the lea&s;t of the brethren, Chri&s;t &s;aid it was done unto him.) It is not as we are men, but as we are obedient to him, as we &s;tand witne&s;&s;es for him, that we meet with the&s;e things. Now as it is not we our&s;elves that do the&s;e things, but the life and power of God in us, &s;o it is not we that are &s;truck at, but that life and power. If it were not for that, we might be as ac|ceptable as other men. It is becau&s;e we are not of the world, but God hath called us out of the word, that we are &s;o hated of the world. This is the true cau&s;e, though the world will no more now acknowledge it than it would in former ages. Yet I do not &s;peak this for my own &s;ake, to avoid my &s;hare in the cro&s;s: For the reproach of Chri&s;t is greater riches than the trea&s;ures of Egypt, to all tho&s;e who
<PB N="7" REF="019435_0006_0FABAC48F40D41A0">
have re&s;pect unto the recompence of the reward. Yea, the pre&s;ence of God, the &s;weet power of life, makes up all our lo&s;&s;es; &s;o that we have no cau&s;e to com|plain. It is very &s;weet, plea&s;ant and profitable, for us to be found &s;ufferers for God; but we know it will not be profitable for you to be found per&s;ecutors: And this is told you in true love and good-will, by one who wi&s;hes no evil to you, for all that evil that you are endeavouring to exerci&s;e toward us. O that God would open your eyes, that ye might &s;ee whom ye have oppo&s;ed, and again&s;t whom ye have hardened and &s;trengthened your&s;elves, that ye might bow to him, and receive life from him, and not peri&s;h in your gain&s;aying and oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>What the envious may judge of the&s;e lines, I little care for, well knowing that the mo&s;t eminent authors have been expo&s;ed to envy, and been obnoxious to the cen&s;ures of pedantic critics. Whatever any may think, this I am well a&s;&s;ured of, that my chief &s;cope hath been for the promotion of the go&s;pel of peace and purity, and for the good of all mankind, not only to delight my reader, but al&s;o to lead him to virtue. If I may be &s;o happy as to have contributed thereto, I &s;hall think my pains well rewarded; and if not, I &s;hall have at lea&s;t this &s;atisfaction, that, according to my ability, I have endeavoured to be beneficial to others, and to edify my fellow mortals in that which is good; which I cannot but think to be well plea&s;|ing to God. And if I have performed any thing that is good, the honor and glory thereof belong to him who is the giver of all good gifts: And it is from him alone I have received all my ability to do any good thing, unto whom belong prai&s;es; ever|la&s;ting prai&s;es are due unto God that is holy. Amen. Thus concluding, I wi&s;h the reader di&s;cretion, and an impartial judgment.</P>

<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Lord God, of infinite goodne&s;s, hath ever dearly loved mankind, yet could never &s;o appear to them &s;ince the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, as to be owned by them, till the veil was taken from before their hearts. I&s;rael in Egypt hearkened not to Mo&s;es, becau&s;e of their angui&s;h and bondage. When they were led out, they were ever and anon murmuring and picking quarrels again&s;t him. Samuel they re|jected (as the Lord lays to their charge) though they might excu&s;e them&s;elves, and &s;ay they had ju&s;t
<PB N="9" REF="019435_0008_0FABAC4B8A89BD18">
exceptions again&s;t his &s;ons. Elijah, that mighty man of God, the great re&s;torer of I&s;rael, and pleader again&s;t Baal by fire, his life was &s;ought for: And though there be not a particular record of their u&s;age of the prophets about tho&s;e days, yet in general he complains that they were all &s;lain but him&s;elf, 1 <HI>Kings,</HI> xix. 10. Micaiah was &s;mitten on the cheek, and jeered by the fal&s;e prophet who &s;mote him, and &s;aid, "Which way went the &s;pirit of the Lord from me to &s;peak unto thee?" And he was commanded to be put in pri&s;on, and fed with bread of affliction and water of affliction. Jeremiah was put into the dungeon, even to the danger of his life; and by tho&s;e few that were left that &s;eemed &s;ingly to enquire by him concern|ing the will of the Lord, <HI>Jer.</HI> xlii. 2, 3, di&s;dainfully re|jected, chap. xliii. 2. Why &s;hould I &s;pend time in particular in&s;tances? What profit can I expect? For though all their bad dealings with them are not relat|ed in &s;cripture, yet Chri&s;t te&s;tifies that they did deal badly with them all; &s;ome of them they &s;toned, &s;ome of them they &s;courged in their &s;ynagogues, &s;ome of them they killed and crucified, and others they per&s;ecuted from city to city: Yea, &s;aith Stephen, "Which of the prophets have not your fathers per&s;ecuted?" And they have &s;lain them which &s;hewed before of the coming of the Ju&s;t One; ye make it &s;uch a &s;trange thing that if Chri&s;t had been a prophet, that they &s;hould have owned him: Why, which of the prophets was owned? And ye have &s;till &s;ome exception or other now again&s;t the &s;ame &s;pirit that was in the pro|phets in former ages, even again&s;t the me&s;&s;enger whom God hath &s;ent in this age, that it is not from God; ye take arguments from one prophet's words to oppo&s;e another prophet with; and from one prophet's manner of coming to oppo&s;e another
<PB N="10" REF="019435_0009_0FABAC4BDB5C93E0">
prophet's coming: If John come neither eating nor drinking, ye reject him for his au&s;terene&s;s: If Chri&s;t come both eating and drinking, ye reject him for his liberty and freedom in the life. Now what was the rea&s;on of this? Chri&s;t him&s;elf gives the rea&s;on, <HI>Matt.</HI> xi. 19. Wi&s;dom is ju&s;tified of her children; ye are not the children of wi&s;dom, ye are not begotten of the life, of the &s;pirit of the prophets, and &s;o cannot ju&s;tify that &s;pirit. Ye have gotten the letter of the prophets; ye are born of that, but ye are not born of the life, ye are not born of the wi&s;dom: And &s;o whoever comes forth in the &s;ame birth from the let|ter with you, that is, being one of your church mem|bers, him ye can own; but if any prophet come forth with that &s;ame &s;pirit, him ye cannot own. He that is born after the fle&s;h, cannot but per&s;ecute him that is born after the &s;pirit. Jeru&s;alem was all along the per|&s;ecutor of the prophets, from the beginning to the end.</P>
<P>And is this nothing to you, O ye profe&s;&s;ors of this age! Search and &s;ee, who have been the per&s;ecutors among you, but they who have had the name of the church and her prophets? Who have &s;lain the witne&s;&s;es? The church of Rome hath &s;lain the wit|ne&s;&s;es again&s;t her, and the Prote&s;tants have &s;lain the witne&s;&s;es again&s;t them. If a man were never &s;o truly zealous, yet if he could not conform to the common prayer-book and ceremonies, how was he per&s;ecuted, though owning the &s;ame Chri&s;t in his very heart and &s;oul; yet, becau&s;e his practice was a te&s;timony again&s;t the fal&s;e church-wor&s;hip, mu&s;t be hunted up and down to courts, impri&s;oned, fined, bani&s;hed. And to this day the Lord can bring forth no birth of his &s;pirit, but the zealous profe&s;&s;or hates, reviles, and &s;eeks to de&s;troy it. If the Lord lay any law upon the con&s;cience, if it be not &s;uitable to their
<PB N="11" REF="019435_0010_0FABAC4E472719B8">
apprehen&s;ions from the letter, how do they reproach, di&s;dain, revile and endeavour to render &s;uch odious to the magi&s;trates, to the churches, and to the people of the world?</P>
<P>Now this I have to &s;ay to you all: All you who re&s;t in any form what&s;oever, &s;hort of the life it&s;elf, ye had even as good have &s;tayed in Egypt, as to fix by the way, and to take up a re&s;t in the wilderne&s;s, &s;hort of Canaan. In plain terms, ye had as good have abode in popery or epi&s;copacy; ye had been as acceptable to God there as here, not that I &s;ay your forms of Independency, Anabapti&s;m, or Quakeri&s;m, are as bad as Popery, &amp;c. nay, they are all &s;omewhat nearer, and the la&s;t of them very much nearer: But your fixing there, and the dead &s;pirit feeding there on the dead thing, is as remote from life as if it had gone quite back again. And this dead &s;pirit is as hateful to God here, as it is among the Papi&s;ts; yea, and in one &s;en&s;e more, becau&s;e it makes a pretence beyond them.</P>
<P>Look about ye, look about ye, all &s;orts of devout profe&s;&s;ors; &s;ee where ye are. Are you not dead in your forms? Is not the good old puritan principle (wherein once was true life in its mea&s;ure) dead and buried there? Con&s;ider with your&s;elves; hath that grown in your forms? Or hath it been &s;lain there? Speak the truth in your own hearts; can you truly &s;ay, from a &s;en&s;ible feeling in the life, that that prin|ciple is &s;till alive in you? While Abel lived in you, Cain could not ri&s;e up in his dominions; but now the right &s;eed is &s;lain, the murdering nature appears.</P>
<P>But why &s;hould we wonder at the&s;e things? There is no new thing under the &s;un. The &s;tate of the world is ju&s;t as it always was; the power of truth in every age hath been &s;till oppo&s;ed by tho&s;e who cried
<PB N="12" REF="019435_0011_0FABAC4FEB05DAE0">
up the form. It were a wonder if it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e. I &s;hould much more wonder, if the teachers and pro|fe&s;&s;ors of this age &s;hould own truth, than that they fight again&s;t it and per&s;ecute it. Well, friends and brethren, be &s;trong in the Lord, and faithful to his truth, in the power of his might; bear the reproach, the afflictions of this age, the per&s;ecutions of this your day. Verily your eyes &s;hall &s;ee that there is a reward for the righteous, and your hearts &s;hall be &s;atisfied with it, when the children of the kingdom (of this age as well as of all former ages) &s;hall be &s;hut out in utter darkne&s;s, where &s;hall be weeping, wailing and gna&s;hing of teeth.</P>

<HEAD>The JEW OUTWARD. Some Exceptions and Arguments of the Jews again&s;t Chri&s;t's Appearance, &amp;c.</HEAD>

Though he lived as never man lived; though he &s;pake as never man &s;pake; though he did what never man did; yet &s;till &s;ome exception or other they had from the letter of the &s;criptures, to which his manner of appearance, his conver&s;ation and his doctrine, did not &s;uit in their judgment; and &s;o, after many di&s;putes and debates, they at length delivered him up to death, as a bla&s;|phemer, a deceiver, a &s;educer of the people.</P>
<P>Many exceptions and arguments they had again&s;t him, again&s;t his de&s;cent, his doctrine, his practices, his miracles, his followers, &amp;c. which I &s;hall refer to heads, to make them more obvious.</P>
<P N="1">1. They excepted at his de&s;cent and kindred. Is not this the carpenter's &s;on? Is not his mother called Mary, and his brethren James and Jo&s;es, and Simon and Judas, and his &s;i&s;ters, are they not all with us? <HI>Matt.</HI> xiii. 55, 56. What! this that glorious Me&s;|&s;iah! the great King of Glory, of whom all the pro|phets prophe&s;ied and &s;poke great things! &s;urely it cannot be. And they were offended in him, ver. 57. It was this made them they could not receive that heavenly doctrine of his which otherwi&s;e might have been life to them, when he taught them that he was the bread of life that came down from heaven; but they murmured becau&s;e of it, and &s;aid, "Is not this Je&s;us, the &s;on of Jo&s;eph, who&s;e father and mother we know? How is it then that he &s;aith, I came down from heaven? <HI>John</HI> vi. 41, 42. So again, <HI>John</HI> vii. 27. We know this man whence he is; but when Chri&s;t cometh, no man knoweth whence he is. This was a clo&s;e argument, and was rai&s;ed up to eat out a deep impre&s;&s;ion of his being the Chri&s;t, as may appear from the foregoing ver&s;e. "He &s;peaketh in|deed

boldly, and deep things, &amp;c. as if he were the Chri&s;t, but how can he be he, &s;eeing it is known from whence he comes?"</P>
<P N="2">2. At his country or place of his education and re|&s;idence, which was Nazareth of Galilee. Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? <HI>John</HI> i. 46. Shall Chri&s;t come out of Galilee? <HI>John</HI> vii. 41. Search and look; for out of Galilee ari&s;eth no pro|phet, ver. 52.</P>
<P N="3">3. At the time and &s;ea&s;on of his coming; he came (as to their &s;en&s;e) before Elias. With this argument they pinched the di&s;ciples, as is &s;ignified in that query of theirs to Chri&s;t; "Why then &s;ay the &s;cribes that Elias mu&s;t fir&s;t come?" <HI>Matt.</HI> xvii. 10. This could not but be a &s;ore argument in the mouth of the &s;cribes, who might rea&s;on with the di&s;ciples on this wi&s;e: What poor, ignorant, &s;otti&s;h, deluded people are you, to own this man for your ma&s;ter, and take him for the Me&s;&s;iah? Elias mu&s;t fir&s;t come, and re|&s;tore all things. If this man preached ever &s;o heaven|ly doctrine, and did ever &s;o many miracles, yet, if he pretend to be the Me&s;&s;iah, he can be but a de|ceiver: For the true Me&s;&s;iah comes not before Elias; and every one knows that Elias is not yet come, nor his work of re&s;toring all things &s;o much as begun.</P>
<P N="4">4. His doctrine admini&s;tered abundance of offence to them, and they were continually &s;tumbling at it. That heavenly doctrine mentioned a little before, that he was the bread of life, they murmured at, <HI>John</HI> vi. 41. When he did but &s;ay God was his father, they pre&s;ently flew out upon him and &s;aid, he made him&s;elf equal with God, <HI>John</HI> v. 18. When he &s;aid de&s;troy this temple, and in three days I will rai&s;e it up, they mi&s;under&s;tood him, and brought it forth as an argument again&s;t him at the time of his &s;uffering,
<PB N="15" REF="019435_0014_0FABAC536F298C20">
<HI>Matt.</HI> xxvi. 61, and ca&s;t it as a jeer in his teeth, <HI>Matt.</HI> xxvii. 40. When he did but &s;ay to the man &s;ick of the pal&s;ey, &s;on, thy &s;ins are forgiven thee, the &s;cribes and Phari&s;ees pre&s;ently exclaimed again&s;t him, who is this that &s;peaketh bla&s;phemy? Who can forgive &s;ins but God alone? <HI>Luke</HI> v. 21, and chap. vii. 19. When he preached very powerfully again&s;t covetou&s;ne&s;s, the Phari&s;ees derided him, <HI>Luke</HI> xvi. 14. Yea, when he did but preach a parable or two about the widow of Sarepta, and Naaman, the Syrian (it coming a little clo&s;e to their &s;tate) all they in the &s;ynagogue were &s;o filled with wrath, that they ro&s;e up and thru&s;t him out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill, to ca&s;t him down headlong, <HI>Luke</HI> iv. 28, 29. At his &s;aying that Abraham rejoiced to &s;ee his day, and he &s;aw it, and was glad; the Jews replied, thou art not yet fifty years old, and ha&s;t thou &s;een Abraham? <HI>John</HI> viii. 57. How ab&s;urd and impo&s;&s;ible was this to them, that a man of not fifty years &s;hould &s;ay, that Abraham (who lived &s;o many ages before) &s;aw his day? And in&s;tead of giving them an argument to demon&s;trate it to them, he only returns them a more confident affirmation, verily verily I &s;ay unto you, before Abraham was I am, ver. 58. Which &s;o enraged them that they took up &s;tones to ca&s;t at him, ver. 59. Now mark, the life &s;peaks what it &s;ees and knows, and &s;o it gives forth its te&s;timony. The wi&s;e profe&s;&s;or, not being in the life, cannot know or receive the te&s;timony; but calls for arguments and demon&s;trations to his wi&s;e eye. The life refu&s;eth to an&s;wer him; but in&s;tead thereof, only affirmeth the thing more &s;trongly and confident|ly. This (being &s;o far from what he looks for, and requires to &s;atisfy him) kindles di&s;dain and rage in him: And he looks upon the life, for this way of

proceeding, as worthy to be &s;toned. What, when they &s;hould lay before Chri&s;t a fair argument, where|by they might plainly convince him by evident rea&s;on that he could not &s;ee Abraham's day, and he in&s;tead of an&s;wering it &s;hould only bring forth a more confi|dent affirmation, would not men's wi&s;dom, in this age, even hi&s;s at &s;uch a thing? Yet this was the way of the life then in that day, and the life may, at his plea&s;ure, take the &s;ame way again now, to offend the wi&s;e and knowing.</P>
<P>When he &s;pake of his being the good &s;hepherd, and of his laying down his life for his &s;heep (and of the hireling's flying, in time of danger, to &s;ave him|&s;elf) <HI>John</HI> x. 11, 12, many of the Jews &s;aid he hath a devil, and is mad, why hear ye him? ver. 20. Many of them that were then the people of God (the &s;eparated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ple, for the Jews were a &s;eparated peo|ple from the world, and &s;tudied the law, and ob|&s;erved the ordinances of Mo&s;es) looked upon Chri&s;t as a man not fit to be heard &s;peak, but as a mad|man, as one that had a devil, as one that might have great power of deceit from the devil, to bewitch men from truth; why hear ye him? What good can ye expect from him? He hath a devil and is mad. O how de&s;perately will bold fle&s;h venture to judge of the life and power of God, when it hath got a little knowledge from the &s;criptures, and a way of wor&s;hip, duties and ordinances! When he &s;aid, I and my father are one, <HI>John</HI> x. 30, they took up &s;tones again to &s;tone him, ver. 31, and made no que&s;tion but they did well in doing of it, as appears by their an&s;wer to his demand, for which of his good works they &s;toned him, they replied very confidently, for a good work we &s;tone thee not, but for bla&s;phemy, and becau&s;e thou being a man, make&s;t thy&s;elf God, ver. 32, 33.
<PB N="17" REF="019435_0016_0FABAC54F56772A0">
And when he &s;aid, if a man keep my &s;aying he &s;hall never &s;ee death, <HI>John</HI> viii. 51, then &s;aid the Jews unto him, now we know thou ha&s;t a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets are dead; who make&s;t thou thy&s;elf? ver. 53. Were not Abraham and the prophets holy men? had not they the &s;ayings of God, and did they not keep the &s;ayings of God? yet they are dead. Such a kind of &s;peech as this mu&s;t needs be from the devil; now thou make&s;t manife&s;t from what &s;pirit thou &s;peake&s;t; now we know thou ha&s;t a devil. And indeed how could the profe&s;&s;ors of that age dige&s;t &s;uch things, being &s;o contrary to what appeared to them to be certain truth in the &s;criptures?</P>
<P>And there were many other things as hard to them, though the exceptions which might or did ari&s;e in their minds are not particularly mentioned; as when he &s;aith, I am the door of the &s;heep, all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers, but the &s;heep did not hear them, <HI>John</HI> x. 7, 8. How offen&s;ive mu&s;t this doctrine needs have been to them, going carnally to under&s;tand and rea&s;on about it? What <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> were all the prophets and holy men before thee thieves and robbers? Did the truth never come till thou broughte&s;t it? What became of our forefathers in for|mer ages? Were they none of them God's &s;heep? Did none of them find the door? For thou &s;aye&s;t thou art the door, and thou ha&s;t been but of late: And whereas thou &s;aye&s;t the &s;heep did not hear them, that is utterly fal&s;e; for they did hear Mo&s;es, and they did hear the prophets, and we have their writ|ings, and will keep to them, for all thee, let who will be thy &s;heep. When he &s;aid that he came not to &s;end peace, but divi&s;ion, <HI>Matt.</HI> x. 25, how readily might they reply, that his own mouth di&s;covered him
<PB N="18" REF="019435_0017_0FABAC55DA018438">
not to be the Me&s;&s;iah, the &s;aviour, the peace-maker; but the worker of divi&s;ions, the cau&s;e of breaches in families, &s;etting three again&s;t two, and two again&s;t three? <HI>Luke</HI> xxi. 51. When he &s;aid, who&s;oever committeth &s;in, is the &s;ervant of &s;in, <HI>John</HI> viii. 34, might they not well except again&s;t this, as condemn|ing the whole generation of the righteous, and making null the way of &s;acrifices, which God had ap|pointed for &s;ins committed at any time by his peo|ple, which could not but pre&s;uppo&s;e their commi&s;|&s;ion of &s;in? Did not Abraham, I&s;aac, David, Mo&s;es, and the re&s;t of the prophets, all commit &s;in, and were they the &s;ervants of &s;in? He taught al&s;o that the children of the kingdom &s;hould be ca&s;t into utter darkne&s;s, <HI>Matt.</HI> viii. 12. O how har&s;h would this &s;ound in the ears of the zealous profe&s;&s;ing Jews, who were waiting and hoping for the kingdom? So in his doctrine there &s;eemed many contradictions to the fle&s;hly under&s;tanding: For one while he &s;aid, I judge no man, for I came not to condemn the world, and yet was not he continually judging and condemn|ing the &s;cribes, the Phari&s;ees, the prie&s;ts, the law|yers, and that whole generation of profe&s;&s;ors? So again he came to &s;eek and to &s;ave that which was lo&s;t; to preach the go&s;pel of peace; and yet another while he &s;aith, he came not to &s;end peace, but a &s;word, and to kindle a fire, and to &s;et men at variance, &amp;c. Again, one while he &s;aid, I and my Father are one; another time, my Father is greater than me; one while he bid men do as the &s;cribes and Phari&s;ees taught; another while he bid men beware of the lea|ven or doctrine of the Phari&s;ees and Sadducees, <HI>Matt.</HI> xvi. 12.</P>

And there were many things the di&s;ciples them&s;elves were not able to bear: For when at a certain time he &s;pake of giving his fle&s;h to eat, not only the Jews, <HI>John</HI> vi. 52, but they al&s;o &s;tumbled, ver. 61. And who is there among profe&s;&s;ors that can now bear it, or receive Chri&s;t's own interpretation of it? who &s;aith, that the fle&s;h which they under|&s;tood profiteth nothing; but the fle&s;h which he meant was &s;pirit and life, ver. 63.</P>
<P>At his practices and conver&s;ation. How is it that he eateth with publicans and &s;inners? <HI>Mark</HI> ii. 16, Behold a gluttonous man and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and &s;inners, <HI>Luke</HI> vii. 14. This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him, for &s;he is a &s;inner, <HI>Luke</HI> vii. 39. At the publicans and &s;inners drawing nigh to hear him, the Phari&s;ees and &s;cribes were offended, and murmured, &s;aying this man receiveth &s;inners, and eateth with them, <HI>Luke</HI> xv. 1, 2. And when he went to Zaccheus's hou&s;e they all murmured, &s;aying that he was gone to be a gue&s;t with a man that is a &s;inner, <HI>Luke</HI> xix. 7.</P>
<P>Again, becau&s;e he healed on the &s;abbath, and ju&s;tified his di&s;ciples in plucking ears of corn on the &s;abbath, they were filled with madne&s;s, and com|muned what they might do to him, <HI>Luke</HI> vi. 3, and

Another time, the ruler of the &s;ynagogue &s;pake with indignation about it, <HI>Luke</HI> xiii. 14, yea, the Jews did per&s;ecute Je&s;us, and &s;ought to &s;lay him, becau&s;e he had healed a man, and bid him take up his bed and walk, on the &s;abbath day, <HI>John</HI> v. 8, 16. And &s;ome of them made it a &s;trong argument again&s;t him, this man is not of God, becau&s;e he keepeth not the &s;abbath day, <HI>John</HI> ix. 16. What! come from God and be a breaker of ordinances! Can the&s;e two &s;tand together? Read and con&s;ider what more &s;trict ordinance of God under the law than the &s;abbath? What one ordinance more conducing to the honor and wor&s;hip of God? Did not their whole re|ligion and wor&s;hip much depend upon it? How could this po&s;&s;ibly but be a great offence to them, in that &s;pirit and literal wi&s;dom from the &s;criptures wherein they &s;tood? Yet Chri&s;t, in his &s;piritual appearance, was lord of the &s;abbath, and in his fle&s;hly appearance he doth not lo&s;e his dominion. Again, they except|ed again&s;t him, that he did not teach his di&s;ciples to fa&s;t and pray, as John did, <HI>Luke</HI> v. 33, but could &s;uffer them to tran&s;gre&s;s the traditions of the elders, <HI>Matt.</HI> xv. 2. He was not &s;trict after the Jewi&s;h way of devotion, nor &s;trict after John's way neither; but again&s;t the traditions of the godly elders of the Jew|i&s;h church; again&s;t &s;anctifying of the Lord's &s;abbath, (ju&s;tifying his di&s;ciples in plucking ears of corn there|on, whereas their forefathers, the Jews, were not &s;o much as to gather manna on that day) again&s;t fa&s;ting and prayer, for he ju&s;tified his di&s;ciples in that they did not fa&s;t and pray as John did, &s;aying, how could they mourn while the bridegroom was with them? <HI>Matt.</HI> ix. 15. And con&s;ider which way the Jews (in the &s;tate they &s;tood) could under&s;tand &s;uch an an&s;wer as this, to re&s;t &s;atisfied therewith.</P>

Whereupon they concluded he could not be of God (for if he had been of God, he would have ob&s;erved the day which God commanded) and if he wrought them not by the power of God, by who&s;e power then mu&s;t he work them?

And &s;ometimes his an&s;wer might &s;eem quite from the thing, as <HI>John</HI> xii. 34, 35.</P>
<P>His not giving re&s;pect to per&s;ons (for it was a known thing of him that he regarded not men's per|&s;ons, <HI>Matt.</HI> xvii. 16) could not be very plea&s;ing to them who loved greetings, and &s;ought honor one of another; he &s;hewed not re&s;pect to Herod, but &s;pake contemptuou&s;ly of him, as men would account it: Go, &s;aith he, and tell that fox, he did not &s;hew re&s;pect to the reverend and grave doctors of the law; nay, nor to the high prie&s;t him&s;elf. Nay he did not &s;hew re&s;pect to his own di&s;ciples, but &s;aid to Peter (when he mildly and affectionately de&s;ired his death might be avoided) get thee behind me, Satan; how har&s;h and rough a reply might this &s;eem? If Peter had erred, through his affection and tenderne&s;s to his ma&s;ter, a meek &s;pirit would gently have in|formed him; but to call him devil, and &s;ay, get thee behind me, what kind of &s;pirit doth this &s;avour of? Would that profe&s;&s;ing Jew &s;ay, who knoweth not the true meekne&s;s, but &s;eeks after a fle&s;hly meek|ne&s;s, which is a &s;ervant to the fle&s;hly wi&s;dom and

prudence, but not true born. Nay, he did not &s;peak re&s;pectfully to his own mother (as man's &s;pirit, by its rule of re&s;pect, would judge and condemn him) for, at the marriage at Cana, when they want|ed wine, "&s;he &s;aith unto him they have no wine;" he &s;aith unto her, woman, what have I to do with thee? <HI>John</HI> xi. 3, 4, and in a manner denied all his relations, <HI>Matt.</HI> xii. 48.</P>
<P>La&s;tly (to in&s;tance no more) at his har&s;h cen&s;ures of all the profe&s;&s;ors of that age (who ob&s;erved the law of Mo&s;es, and I&s;rael's &s;tatutes) with all their la|borious and godly teachers; ju&s;tifying none but him&s;elf, and what he taught, and a few of his fol|lowers. He told them, that they had not the love of God in them, <HI>John</HI> v. 42. Did this not, think ye, &s;eem to them a very har&s;h charge? And why not the love of God? becau&s;e they did not follow him and his new doctrine; yea, would they be ready to &s;ay, they did love God, and kept his command|ments, &s;abbaths and ordinances, which he tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>He laid this al&s;o to their charge, that they did not believe Mo&s;es, <HI>John</HI> v. 46. What an unju&s;t charge might this &s;eem? when they were &s;o zealous for Mo&s;es; and their very di&s;like of him, and con|trover&s;y again&s;t him, was for the &s;ake of the law and ordinances of Mo&s;es.</P>
<P>Another charge he laid to them was, that they were not the children of Abraham, or of God; but of the devil, <HI>John</HI> viii. 39, 42, 44. What a ra&s;h, cen&s;orious man might they account him? thus to &s;peak of them who were the human &s;eed of Abraham, who were &s;uch &s;trict ob&s;ervers of God's laws and ordinances (which is the property of his children) and &s;uch enemies to the devil, that they would not

be drawn from the truths and way of wor&s;hip, taught by Mo&s;es and the prophets; no, not by all the miracles he could work.</P>
<P>He called them a faithle&s;s and perver&s;e generation, <HI>Matt.</HI> i. 17, 18. He told them that they did not know God; though they &s;aid with confidence that he was their God, <HI>John</HI> xii. 54, 55. How could they bear this? They had been &s;tudying the law and the prophets, and had a great &s;tock of know|ledge from thence, and were &s;trict and exact in wor|&s;hip (&s;ome of them, as well as Paul, might be, ac|cording to the law, blamele&s;s) and now to be told they did not know God: Nay, he that abound|eth in knowledge, devotion and wor&s;hip, yet not being in the life and pure power of the &s;pirit, hath not one draught of the true knowledge.</P>
<P>He told them that they &s;hould die in their &s;ins, <HI>John</HI> viii. 21. (O hard word, and &s;evere judgment!) and yet he had told them a little before, he judged no man, ver. 15. Yea they did think them&s;elves ex|ceedingly wronged by him; and thought that no man that had any thing of God in him could &s;peak &s;uch things, but only one that was an enemy to the people of God, and led by the &s;pirit of Satan. To this effect they expre&s;s them&s;elves, ver. 48 of that chapter, &s;ay we not well thou art a Samaritan, and ha&s;t a devil? Yea, when Chri&s;t charged them with going about to kill him, they &s;eemed to them&s;elves &s;o clear in their own con&s;ciences, that they an&s;wered, thou ha&s;t a devil, who goes about to kill thee? <HI>John</HI> vii. 29. How ea&s;ily might they clo&s;e up the con|trover&s;y, and by this very thing conclude him to be a fal&s;e prophet? He &s;ays, we went about to kill him; when, God knows, there was not &s;uch a thing in our hearts: Can this man be a true prophet?
<PB N="27" REF="019435_0026_0FABAC5D2F2876C8">
Yet Chri&s;t knew the profe&s;&s;ing Jew to be the mur|derer, and in and for his religion's &s;ake &s;till &s;eeking to &s;lay him. And there is no &s;uch murderer of Chri&s;t, the life, upon the earth, as the zealous pro|fe&s;&s;or and wor&s;hipper out of the life. He that is in the life cannot per&s;ecute any man; he that is out of the life cannot but per&s;ecute him that is in the life. Hereby the true and fal&s;e Chri&s;tian may be di&s;cerned, by the weake&s;t, &s;imple and &s;ingle eye.</P>
<P>And for their teachers and expounders of the law, how exceedingly bitter did he &s;eem again&s;t? And how heavy things was he continually laying to their charge? He called them blind guides, hypocrites, painted &s;epulchres, graves which appear not, and pronounced woe upon woe again&s;t them; read that one place, <HI>Matt.</HI> xxiii. 33, ye &s;erpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye e&s;cape the damnation of hell? What! &s;peak thus of our zealous teachers, who &s;tudy the law, are &s;trict in practi&s;ing of the ordinan|ces, and take &s;uch pains to in&s;truct us in the mind of God, from Mo&s;es and the prophets! Was &s;uch a man as this fit to live? nay, and he does not &s;how a go&s;pel &s;pirit. Mark how &s;harp and bitter his words come from him, for indeed a &s;harper &s;peech, with greater vehemency and indignation of &s;pirit, can hardly be &s;poken; and they might &s;eem to aggravate this &s;harp condemnation of his, from his own con|fe&s;&s;ion; he him&s;elf had confe&s;&s;ed, that they &s;at in Mo&s;es's chair. Now he might have &s;hewn &s;ome honor to Mo&s;es's chair, and to their office, which was of God, and doubtle&s;s good, and not have gone about to make them thus odious in the eyes of the people. Nay, he him&s;elf had bid men do as they &s;aid, but in ver. 3 of that chapter. Now was it likely that ever men &s;hould mind what they &s;aid, or ob&s;erve their

doctrine, when he had thus repre&s;ented them as oppre&s;&s;ors of the con&s;cience, ver. 4, as devourers of widows hou&s;es, and making long prayers in hypo|cri&s;y ver. 15, as making their pro&s;elytes more the children of hell than them&s;elves, as neglecters of the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith, ver. 23, as appearing righteous to men, but full of hypocri&s;y and iniquity, ver. 28, as of the &s;ame generation that killed the prophets, ver. 31, 32, as deceivers; as &s;uch as led into the ditch, and bid men beware of their leaven? Were the&s;e good kind of encouragements for people to hear them? Yea, he charged them with &s;hutting up the kingdom of heaven again&s;t men, and not going in them&s;elves, nor &s;uffering men to enter that were going in, ver. 13. How could they ob&s;erve what they taught without hearing them? and would Chri&s;t wi&s;h any to hear &s;uch men as the&s;e? Yet for all this, without doubt they were not without their ju&s;tifications again&s;t Chri&s;t in the&s;e re&s;pects; and al&s;o had their charges, on the other hand, ready again&s;t him. Now how did they &s;hut up the kingdom of heaven again&s;t men? Did not they teach the law, and direct men to the ordi|nances of God, and open the prophets words to them? Was this &s;hutting up the kingdom of heaven? and would not they &s;uffer men to enter? Why their work was to win people to their profe&s;&s;ion&punc; they would compa&s;s &s;ea and land to make a pro&s;elyte. How <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> might the Jews have pleaded again&s;t Chri&s;t, that he did &s;lander their godly mini&s;ters, who were very painful and zealous in opening the &s;criptures, and teaching the way of God?

under&s;tand the thing: It is thus, any teaching or expounding of &s;criptures out of the life, &s;huts up the kingdom, for the life is the kingdom, and words from the life yield the &s;avour of the kingdom; but words out of it, though ever &s;o good and true, reach not to the life in another, but only build up a know|ledge in the contrary wi&s;dom, and teach to hold the truth in the unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, where Satan's kingdom &s;tands, and where he hath the dominion of all that is brought thither. And &s;o this kind of teaching and knowledge &s;huts up the door and way of life, and mu&s;t be lo&s;t, before the kingdom can be found. They &s;hut up the true kingdom, but they opened ano|ther kingdom, they opened the kingdom another way, which was in truth &s;hutting of it; and they had di&s;|ciples and children of the kingdom, whom they plea&s;ed with the hope of life, and fed with promi&s;es and comforts; but the&s;e the Lord would &s;hut out. Many &s;hall come from the ea&s;t and we&s;t, and &s;hall &s;it down with Abraham, and I&s;aac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven; but the children of the kingdom &s;hall be ca&s;t out into utter darkne&s;s, <HI>Matt.</HI> viii. 11, 12. This is true at this day in the pre&s;ent di&s;pen&s;a|tion, as it was then in that di&s;pen&s;ation; though men make it a great accu&s;ation again&s;t us, charging us that we &s;ay none are the people of God but our&s;elves, and as if all were damned but we. The&s;e are mens har&s;h and un&s;avoury expre&s;&s;ions; we u&s;e not to &s;peak after this manner, but &s;oberly open the &s;tate of the thing as it &s;tands in the truth, and as it hath been re|vealed unto us by him who is true, and cannot lie; which is thus:</P>
<P>That through which men are &s;aved, is the di&s;pen|&s;ation of truth in their age. The mea&s;ure of light which God gives forth in every age, that is the

means and proper way of &s;alvation in that age; and where-ever men get or profe&s;s of the knowledge of truth declared in former ages, yet making u&s;e of that to with&s;tand the pre&s;ent di&s;pen&s;ation of truth in their age, they cannot thereby be &s;aved; but may thereby be hardened again&s;t that which &s;hould &s;ave them. And this we are a&s;&s;ured of from the Lord, that as the Jews could not be &s;aved by the law of Mo&s;es (making u&s;e of it in oppo&s;ition to the &s;hining of the light of God in the prophets in their &s;everal ages) nor afterwards could be &s;aved by magnifying and ob&s;erving both the words of Mo&s;es and the prophets, and their belief from thence of a Me&s;&s;iah to come, making u&s;e of tho&s;e things to oppo&s;e that appearance of Chri&s;t in the fle&s;h, which was the di&s;pen&s;ation of their day then; no more can any profe&s;&s;ors be &s;aved now by the be|lief of a Chri&s;t come, or any thing which they can learn or practi&s;e from the &s;criptures, making u&s;e thereof to oppo&s;e the di&s;pen&s;ation of this day; which di&s;pen&s;ation is the immediate and powerful breaking forth of the light of the &s;pirit in the hearts of God's people, who have earne&s;tly &s;ought, and in much &s;orrow and perplexity of &s;pirit longed and waited for him, after this long dark night of the antichri&s;tian apo&s;tacy.</P>
<P>There remain yet &s;ome other exceptions again&s;t him, about the time of his &s;uffering death, with his hard u&s;age, which &s;hould not wholly be pa&s;&s;ed over: As,</P>
<P N="1">1. His di&s;re&s;pectful or irreverent an&s;wering of the high prie&s;t, as it &s;eemed to them, when he a&s;ked him of his doctrine, <HI>John</HI> xviii. 19.

and &s;implicity of the life, which bows to God, and cannot regard man in the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, &s;eems rude and unmannerly to the lofty &s;pirit of the world.</P>
<P N="2">2. His &s;ilence at the te&s;timonies brought again&s;t him, and to the high prie&s;t when he que&s;tioned him, <HI>Mark</HI> xiv. 60, 61. Indeed either the &s;peaking or &s;ilence in the life, is offen&s;ive to the carnal profe&s;&s;or, who knoweth not the law of the life in this particular; but can either &s;peak or be &s;ilent, according to his own will. This is the difference between the true and fal&s;e Chri&s;tian; the fal&s;e Chri&s;tian's knowledge and religion &s;tand in his own will, in his own under|&s;tanding, he &s;peaks in his own time; both which are crucified in him that is born of the &s;pirit.</P>
<P N="3">3. When he did &s;peak the truth him&s;elf, the high prie&s;t rent his cloaths, and charged him with bla&s;|phemy, <HI>Matt.</HI> xxvi. 64. And tho&s;e that were by fell in with the high prie&s;t, and &s;aid, he was worthy of death, ver. 66. Then they &s;pit in his face, and buffeted him, and &s;mote him, and mocked him, and blindfolded him, and &s;truck him on the face, bidding him prophe&s;y who &s;mote him, <HI>Matt.</HI> xxvi. 67, 68, and <HI>Luke</HI> xxii. 63, 64. When they brought him to Pilate, they would have Pilate take it for granted that he was an evil-doer, and worthy of death: For when Pilate a&s;ked for their accu&s;ation again&s;t him, they an&s;wer, if he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee, <HI>John</HI> xviii. 29, 30. Pilate refu&s;ing &s;o to proceed in judgment, ver. 31, they begin to bring in their charges: We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Cae&s;ar, &s;aying that he him&s;elf is Chri&s;t, a king <HI>Luke</HI> xxiii. 2. Pilate examines him herein; but profe&s;&s;es he can find no fault in him at all, <HI>John</HI> xviii. 38. Then the chief prie&s;ts accu&s;ed
<PB N="32" REF="019435_0031_0FABAC62F1556118">
him of many other things, <HI>Mark</HI> xv. 3, and were more fierce; &s;aying, he &s;tirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Gal|lilee to this place; this indeed was his great offence, he taught with the authority of the &s;pirit, and not as the &s;cribes. Then Pilate &s;ent him to Herod, where the chief prie&s;ts and &s;cribes &s;tood vehemently accu&s;ing him, who que&s;tioned him much, but he an&s;wered him nothing. And Herod, with his men of war, &s;et him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and &s;ent him back to Pilate, <HI>Luke</HI> xxiii. 9&mdash;11. Pilate profe&s;&s;ed that he could not find him guilty of this &s;econd charge, neither of perverting the people, ver. 14, therefore cha&s;ti&s;ing him, he would relea&s;e him, ver. 18, but the people, by the per&s;ua&s;ion of the chief prie&s;ts and elders, cried all at once away with this man, and re|lea&s;e unto us Barabbas, ver. 11, but let him be cru|cified, crucify him, crucify him! ver. 21, &amp;c. Now when Pilate had &s;courged him, and the &s;oldiers had &s;tripped him, and put on him a &s;carlet robe, and had put a crown of plaited thorns on his head, and a reed in his right hand, and had bowed the knee to him, in mockery, and &s;pit on him, and &s;mote him with a reed, he brings him forth to them again, hoping this might appea&s;e their malice, and they might be content to &s;pare his being crucified; they tell him they have a law, and by their law he ought to die, becau&s;e he made him&s;elf the Son of God, <HI>John</HI> xix. 4, 8. See how they turn and wind every way to make the innocent an offender, and to make &s;ome law, of one kind or other, take hold of him; but when all their accu&s;ations would not prevail with Pi|late, but &s;till, from the &s;en&s;e of his innocency, he had a mind to relea&s;e him, they u&s;e another &s;ubtle

artifice, telling him, if he let this man go, he was not Cae&s;ar's friend, <HI>John</HI> xix. 12. This carries it with Pilate; now he di&s;putes no farther, but delivers him up to their will, <HI>Luke</HI> xxiii. 5. Now thou who reade&s;t this, take heed of judging the Jews for all this wickedne&s;s, while the &s;ame nature is alive in thee which did all this in them; for a&s;&s;uredly thou, in whom that nature which did it in them is not &s;ub|dued, woulde&s;t have done the &s;ame thing, had&s;t thou lived in tho&s;e days. Thou that di&s;daine&s;t and per|&s;ecute&s;t the appearance of Chri&s;t in this age, woulde&s;t have di&s;dained and have per&s;ecuted his appearance in that age. Do not deceive thy &s;oul.</P>
<P>The Jews did as little think that ever they &s;hould have put a prophet, or any good man, to death, much le&s;s the Me&s;&s;iah, as thou can&s;t: Yea, they could blame their fathers for killing the prophets, and &s;ay, if they had lived in tho&s;e days, they would not have done it; and yet do&s;t thou not read what they did? The per&s;ecuting &s;pirit was ever blind, and could in no age read its evil and bitter nature, and its enmity again&s;t the life and power. Be not thou blind in thy day, as they were in theirs; and an ene|my, under pretence of being a friend.</P>
<P N="4">4. Another exception or argument again&s;t him, about the time of his &s;uffering death, was, that he did not put forth his power to &s;ave him&s;elf from the cro&s;s: He &s;aved others, let him &s;ave him&s;elf, if he be the Chri&s;t, the cho&s;en of God, <HI>Luke</HI> xxiii. 35. Is it likely that this is the Son of God, and that he did &s;o many miracles by the power of God, and cannot now &s;ave him&s;elf from the cro&s;s? This, his &s;uffering death on the cro&s;s, did a little &s;tumble &s;ome of the di&s;ciples, as may appear, <HI>Luke</HI> xxiv. 20, 21, and was enough to have overturned the faith of any

which &s;tood not in the &s;pirit and in the power. The &s;oldiers al&s;o could mock, and manage their argument again&s;t him, &s;aying, if thou be the King of the Jews, &s;ave thy&s;elf, <HI>Luke</HI> xxiii. 37. And they that pa&s;&s;ed by reviled him, wagging their heads, and &s;aying, thou that de&s;troye&s;t the temple, and builde&s;t it in three days, &s;ave thy&s;elf. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cro&s;s, <HI>Matt.</HI> xxvii. 39, 40. Likewi&s;e the chief prie&s;ts, with the &s;cribes and elders, mocked among them&s;elves, &s;aying, he &s;aved others, him&s;elf he cannot &s;ave. Let Chri&s;t, the King of I&s;rael, de&s;cend now from the cro&s;s, that we may &s;ee, and believe, <HI>Mark</HI> xv. 31, 32. One of the thieves al&s;o railed on him, &s;aying, if thou be the Chri&s;t, &s;ave thy&s;elf and us, <HI>Luke</HI> xxiii. 39. And when he cried out to his God, Eli, Eli, &amp;c. they derided him: This man calleth for Elias; let us &s;ee whether Elias will come and &s;ave him, <HI>Matt.</HI> xxvii. 47, 49. And after he was dead, the chief prie&s;ts and Phari&s;ees &s;pake of him as of a known deceiver, ver. 63, and &s;eem, in a pious zeal for the church, to take care that there be no further occa&s;ion, after his death, for the reviving and &s;preading of his deceit, and error, ver. 64. Thus the holy one, the pure one, the ju&s;t and true one, in who&s;e heart and mouth was no guile found, was numbered among tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ors, accounted a deceiver, and put to death as a bla&s;phemer, by the zealous prie&s;ts and profe&s;&s;ors of that age, who were &s;o confident of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of their cau&s;e, on the behalf of the law of Mo&s;es, and their &s;abbaths, temple, &amp;c. again&s;t him, that when Pilate wa&s;hed his hands, as clear of his blood, all the people an&s;wered, and &s;aid, his blood be on us, and on our children, <HI>Matt.</HI> xxvii. 25.</P>

<P>Their great exceptions again&s;t our doctrine are: 1.

<P>An&s;wer. Indeed we cannot but preach up the light within, and declare unto men how great things it hath done for us; even that which we could never by any means meet with from any light without. And this is perfect, and tends to make perfect, carrying on its work daily. Now he that feels its virtue, cannot doubt of its power; he that &s;eeth the body of &s;in daily going off, cannot doubt but he may be &s;tripped. In|deed, if a man &s;trive again&s;t &s;in in his own will, and by his own gathered knowledge, he cannot get much ground, and &s;o it is hard for him to believe perfection. But he that feels unity with that which is perfect, cannot but acknowledge that it is able to perfect him, and in faith and patience is encouraged to hope and wait for it.</P>
<P N="2">2. That we deny that Chri&s;t that died at Jeru&s;alem, and his imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;et up an inhe|rent righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="019435_0035_0FABAC67AAF9ADB0">An&s;wer. We know no other Chri&s;t than that which died at Jeru&s;alem, only we confe&s;s our chief know|ledge of him is in &s;pirit. And as Chri&s;t &s;aid in the days of his fle&s;h, that the way to know his father was to know him; and he that knew him knew the father al&s;o; &s;o we now witne&s;s, that the way to know Chri&s;t is to know the &s;pirit; and he that knoweth the &s;pirit, knoweth Chri&s;t al&s;o; with whom Chri&s;t is one, and from whom he cannot be &s;eparated. And as for im|puted righteou&s;ne&s;s, it is too precious a thing to us to be denied by us; that which we deny, is mens putting it out of its place, applying it to them who are nor in the true &s;aith, and walk not in the true light: For in the true light, where the fellow&s;hip is with the father and the &s;on, there alone the blood clean&s;eth, 1 <HI>John</HI> i. 7. And there alone the righ|teou&s;ne&s;s is imputed to him, who is clean&s;ed by the blood in the light, and not to him who knows it not. And as for inherent righteou&s;ne&s;s, we meddle not with that word, but this we &s;ay, that our life ex|ceedingly lies in feeling the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t wrought and revealed in us; and we wi&s;h men could come out of the rea&s;oning about it, into the feeling of the &s;ame thing with us: For then we are &s;ure they would not &s;o &s;harply, nor &s;o long contend.</P>
<P N="3">3. That we deny the ordinances and means of &s;alvation.</P>
<P>An&s;wer. We deny nothing that the apo&s;tles and Chri&s;tians formerly practi&s;ed; nor do we deny any thing that any now practi&s;e in the light, and in the faith; but the &s;etting up &s;uch things in the will, that we deny; or the imitating the&s;e without the com|mand of the &s;pirit, that we deny al&s;o. And this we te&s;tify, that Antichri&s;t crept in here, and that they are his great cover to keep men from the life; and
<PB N="37" REF="019435_0036_0FABAC6873222238">
therefore warn men to mind the life, and to take heed they be not kept from the &s;ub&s;tance by the &s;hadows, where Antichri&s;t lies lurking to bewitch from the &s;ub&s;tance. And we are &s;ure that the&s;e, in Antichri&s;t's hands, are not the means of &s;alvation; but keep from the &s;ight of the holy city, where the life and &s;alvation is. And we read that the outward count was given to the Gentiles; who trod under foot the holy city, <HI>Rev.</HI> xi. 2. And we have found by ex|perience, that while we our&s;elves were crying up the outward court, we did trample under foot the city, though we then knew it not.</P>
<P>Their exceptions again&s;t our per&s;ons are, that we are ignorant, illiterate, and al&s;o un&s;ettled per&s;ons, who have &s;till been &s;eeking up and down, &amp;c.</P>
<P>An&s;wer. What per&s;ons are fitte&s;t for God to make u&s;e of, towards the recovery of his people out of the apo&s;tacy? Doth not God chu&s;e that which is weak, and mean, and contemptible, that his glory might the more appear? Is not this a more likely way for him to &s;teal upon the world, than if he ap|peared in the wi&s;e and learned ones? And among whom is his appearance to be expected? Among tho&s;e that are &s;ettled upon their lees in the apo&s;tacy? Or among tho&s;e who have mourned, panted, and &s;ought to come out of it, and could not be &s;ettled without his appearing to them, and fixing of their feet upon the rock. But have we been un&s;ettled, &s;ince God hath fa&s;tened us on the living foundation? Nay, here is no more going out; but he that abides faith|ful, remains a pillar in the hou&s;e of God. Men ex|cept likewi&s;e again&s;t our practices, as that we &s;hew not re&s;pect to per&s;ons, and that we are not &s;trict, after their manner, in duties, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="019435_0037_0FABAC6969743690">An&s;wer. We have heard that voice, fear God and give glory to him, <HI>Rev.</HI> xiv. 7.

And or duties, we have bewailed, in the &s;ight of the Lord, our former running into duties without his &s;pirit: And we mu&s;t confe&s;s, we can only pray in the &s;pirit; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing in the &s;pirit; wait in the &s;pirit; &s;peak in the &s;pi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">it, as that gives utterance, and not of our&s;elves, or when we will, but as we &s;ee life, &s;trength and power from on high, leading and a&s;&s;i&s;ting us.

<P>It is likewi&s;e excepted again&s;t us, that we do not work miracles.</P>
<P>An&s;wer. We point to that which wrought all the outward miracles formerly, and which now worketh great inward miracles in &s;pirit; and we are &s;ure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he &s;ame power which we have received the go&s;pel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, is of the &s;ame healing virtue. But that power worketh according to the purpo&s;e of its own will, and not according to the will of man. Yea, though Paul had the gift of healing, yet he left Trophimus, at Miletum, &s;ick, 2d <HI>Tim.</HI> iv. 20. Neither was the will or wi&s;dom of man &s;atisfied in all tho&s;e mira|cles that Chri&s;t and the apo&s;tles wrought. It is enough for us to feel and live in the moving of the power; in which we rejoice, and are more &s;atisfied,
<PB N="39" REF="019435_0038_0FABAC69DDA81638">
that by it our names are written in the book of life, than we could by any &s;uch outward and vi&s;ible ap|pearance, and manife&s;tation of it. But if we did work outward miracles, yet if thou had&s;t not an in|ward eye to &s;ee them with, thou woulde&s;t not be able to di&s;tingui&s;h by what power they were wrought.</P>
<P>To what purpo&s;e &s;hould I mention any more par|ticulars? Is it not enough? Oh! fear before the Lord! and do not lo&s;e the pre&s;ent di&s;pen&s;ation of life through mi&s;take, or becau&s;e ye cannot have things &s;uited to your corrupt wills; but know the go&s;pel, which is an inward di&s;pen&s;ation, and doth not con&s;i&s;t in outward &s;hadows, but in inward virtue, life and power. For the kingdom of God is righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace, and joy in the holy &s;pirit. Come to wait for that, to feel that, to unite there&punc; and then we &s;hall not differ about that which is outward. But it is Antichri&s;t's way, by the magi&s;trate's power, to force an agreement about the outward, which de&s;troys that tenderne&s;s of con&s;cience which pre&s;erves the in|ward.</P>
<P>And now let me put one que&s;tion to you; where is the deceit of the ages after Chri&s;t to be expected? Did the Jews deny Mo&s;es and the prophets writings, or ordinances? Nay, were they not very zealous for the&s;e? And were not the&s;e their cover under which they per&s;ecuted Chri&s;t, and vented all their malice again&s;t him? So can it be expected now, that the deceivers of this age &s;hould deny the apo&s;tle's writ|ings, or the practices therein mentioned? Of is it not rather to be expected, that under their crying up of the&s;e, they &s;hould hide their enmity again&s;t the life? Search and &s;ee, hath not every after-age of profe&s;&s;ors took up the words and practices of them who were per&s;ecuted in the foregoing age; and
<PB N="40" REF="019435_0039_0FABAC6AA8589918">
under the profe&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e words and practices, have hid their &s;pirit of per&s;ecution? There is a remnant only among profe&s;&s;ors to be &s;aved; the generality of them have &s;till been per&s;ecutors, creeping into the form, getting that for a cover upon their backs, and then fighting again&s;t the life and power. Oh! wait on the Lord in his fear, that ye may be found wor|thy to know the per&s;ecuted truth on the one hand, and the per&s;ecuting &s;pirit on the other hand, in this day of large profe&s;&s;ion, and al&s;o of bitter per&s;ecution!</P>
<P>Now what might be the cau&s;e, or how could it come to pa&s;s, that the zealous wor&s;hippers of that age &s;hould thus err in their zeal, and be thus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eady and ra&s;h again&s;t him, whom they looked for to be their Saviour? How came they thus to err in vi&s;ion, and &s;tumble in judgment, in &s;o weighty a matter? Shew unto us the cau&s;e, that we may &s;ee whether the &s;ame cau&s;e be not in us: For undoubtedly if it be, it will produce the &s;ame effect; and &s;o we may ig|norantly draw upon our heads the &s;ame heavy wrath in our day, that they did in their day.</P>
<P>An&s;wer. The cau&s;es were many; I may mention &s;ome few of the principal ones; which if they be &s;een into and removed, by that power which is able to do it, &s;uch as are of a more inferior influence, will not be able to &s;tand.</P>
<P N="1">1. One cau&s;e of their blind zeal, and bitterne&s;s again&s;t Chri&s;t, was their ignorance of the &s;criptures, and of the power of God. If they had known the &s;criptures in the true light, they could not but have known Chri&s;t, from whom the &s;criptures were given forth; and if they had known <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he power of God, they could not but have known <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> who came in the power. Yea, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hey had knowledge enough of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, in the letter:
<PB N="41" REF="019435_0040_0FABAC6D31B2ABE8">
They knew the words of &s;cripture, they could make large expo&s;itions of them. They knew what was &s;aid in &s;cripture concerning the power of God, but they knew not the thing it&s;elf; and &s;o turned again&s;t it, and made u&s;e of the words which came from it, and te&s;tified of it, again&s;t it.</P>
<P N="2">2. A &s;econd cau&s;e of this their &s;ad mi&s;carriage in their zeal was, their putting the law and ordinances, and writings of the prophets, out of their proper places. They exceedingly magnified and cried them up, in that carnal way wherein they apprehended and practi&s;ed them, but under&s;tood not the right end and u&s;e of them. And by the&s;e means, practi&s;ing the &s;hadows in the carnal mind, they lo&s;t the &s;ub&s;tance, which the proper u&s;e of the &s;hadows was to have pointed them unto.</P>
<P N="3">3. Their high conceits of the goodne&s;s of their &s;tate in relation to God, and of their certainty of their knowledge of the truths of God, from Mo&s;es and the prophets. They were confident they knew God aright, and that he was their father, and that they were his children and people. And &s;o Chri&s;t's appearing in a &s;eeming contrariety to the&s;e, notwith|&s;tanding all his powerful preaching and miracles, they made no que&s;tion but they might boldly con|clude him not to be of God.</P>
<P N="4">4. Chri&s;t coming in a way that they looked not for him. They had concluded from the &s;criptures how Chri&s;t mu&s;t appear; and he coming in a far different manner, they could not own him, but looked upon him as a deceiver, one that pretended to be Chri&s;t, but was not like to what the &s;criptures &s;aid of Chri&s;t. So what the &s;criptures &s;aith of Chri&s;t's &s;econd coming, is hid as much from the carnal eye of profe&s;&s;ors in this age, as what was &s;aid concerning his fir&s;t coming,
<PB N="42" REF="019435_0041_0FABAC705CDAA860">
was hid from them in their age; and he will &s;teal upon them as a thief, at a time, and in a way, and after a manner, that they expect not.</P>
<P N="5">5. (Which is the main-one, and the cau&s;e of all the former) becau&s;e they were from the light within, from the true light in their own hearts and con&s;ciences. The light within is the great ordinance of God, and the proper means to give the knowledge of him, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> iv. 6, without which it was never received under any di&s;pen&s;ation: For the light that &s;hines abroad, or from without, can alone be known and received by the light that &s;hines within. Chri&s;t him&s;elf opens this in a parable; the light of the body, &s;aith he, is the eye; if therefore thine eye be &s;ingle, clear, without beams or motes, thy whole body &s;hall be full of light, <HI>Matt.</HI> vi. 22. But if that be evil, if that be dark, if that be clo&s;ed by the God of this world, all Mo&s;es's words, all the prophets words, yea, all Chri&s;t and the apo&s;tles words, cannot give thee light. Can I &s;ee the light of the &s;un, moon, or &s;tars, or of any fire or candle, if I have not a natural eye, and if that natural eye be not open? So neither can I &s;ee the light of any di&s;pen&s;ation of life, if I have not an eye within me open, wherewith to &s;ee it. So that which gives me the &s;ight of the things of God, is the eye which God hath given me; by that may be read the eternal power and god|head in the creatures, in the books of Mo&s;es and the prophets, in the writings of the evangeli&s;ts and the apo&s;tles; as the &s;pirit leads and opens, yea, the &s;ame &s;pirit that opened to the&s;e without books, may again open to any of us without books at his plea&s;ure, and will not be limited to books; and we then may read al&s;o as they did, even within in the &s;pirit, and in the immediate life; but without this, can none of the things of God be read aright. Now the God of this
<PB N="43" REF="019435_0042_0FABAC7159E39428">
world had blinded this eye in the Jews; yea, they them&s;elves had &s;topped their ears and clo&s;ed their eyes, &amp;c. they would not &s;ee this way, they would not be converted and healed this way. They would keep up the knowledge which they had gathered from Mo&s;es and the prophets, without this eye; and with that they would &s;ee, or not at all.</P>
<P>Thus being from the light within, they could not &s;ee the place of life within, where life is to be re|ceived: They could not &s;ee the womb of wi&s;dom which is within, and &s;o could not enter into it, and be born again; and being not born of the wi&s;dom, how could they ju&s;tify the wi&s;dom? Being not born of the light, how could they know or own Chri&s;t, who&s;e coming and appearance was in the light? For that appearance of Chri&s;t the life, in that body of fle&s;h, could not be di&s;cerned by all mens wi&s;dom in the letter; the di&s;ciples them&s;elves came not &s;o to know it, but my father which is in heaven hath re|vealed it to you. And mark it: The di&s;ciples who were illiterate, and not &s;o knowing of the &s;criptures that were written of Chri&s;t, yet they knew Chri&s;t: But the &s;cribes and Phari&s;ees, who were very &s;kilful in the letter, could not know him. What was the rea&s;on? The rea&s;on lay in the difference of the eye, or light, wherewith they looked; the one looked with an outward eye, the other with an inward eye. And a little inward light will do that, which a great deal of outward light will not do. And this I can certainly affirm, that all the light that men can ga|ther from the &s;criptures, cannot give them the know|ledge of Chri&s;t as he hath appeared in this age; nay, nor as he hath appeared in any age, &s;ince the days of the apo&s;tles; but a little true inward light will give the knowledge of this thing, and open tho&s;e &s;crip|tures
<PB N="44" REF="019435_0043_0FABAC7165B4C560">
infallibly, in its &s;ea&s;on, which all the genera|tions of wife and learned men have been controvert|ing and di&s;puting about, in that wi&s;dom and &s;earch|ing &s;pirit which is never to under&s;tand them. This then is the main and full rea&s;on of this deep error of the Jews, and their de&s;perate &s;plitting upon the rock, which would have &s;aved them. They were begotten of the letter, which was given forth in former ages; but not of the life, which was rai&s;ed up in their age; and &s;o they knew not how to turn to the light with|in, which alone was able to give them the true and certain knowledge of the things of God.</P>
<P>Now con&s;ider the&s;e things well, O ye profe&s;&s;ors of this age! and take heed that ye do not fall after the &s;ame example of unblief. Be not high-minded, but fear. Be not &s;o confident of what you have gathered by your wi&s;dom for truth from the &s;criptures, after the manner that they were, of what they had gathered by their wi&s;dom; but fear le&s;t ye &s;hould be mi&s;taken as they were; and wait for the opening of that light in you, which was &s;hut in them; even the true eye, in the true light, by the holy anointing; where there never was nor can be any mi&s;take. The Jews fell by unbelief. Unbelief of what? They believed the &s;criptures, they believed according to that knowledge they had gathered from the &s;criptures; but they did not believe in the living word. They had a know|ledge abiding in them, which they had gathered from the &s;criptures, but they had not the living word abiding in them; and &s;o their faith was but unbelief, for the living faith &s;tands in the belief of the living word in the heart, which the &s;criptures direct to; without the knowledge of which, all knowledge of words is vain; and without faith in which, all faith is vain al&s;o. Now &s;aith the apo&s;tle to the Gentile,
<PB N="45" REF="019435_0044_0FABAC721E532F00">
Chri&s;tian, thou &s;tande&s;t by faith, <HI>Rom.</HI> xi. 20. By what faith? By faith in that word in the heart, which they neglected and turned from, <HI>Rom.</HI> x. 8. For Mo&s;es had taught them, after the laws and ordinances about wor&s;hip and &s;acrifices, that the word that they were to obey and do, the word that could give them life, and make them obedient to all the com|mandments without, was in their heart and mouth, <HI>Deut.</HI> xxx. 14. And &s;o the prophet Micah, when they propo&s;ed &s;acrifices and oil to plea&s;e God with, brings them to this, which was given to them in common with mankind, <HI>Micah</HI> vi. 8. For all ordi|nances, and laws, and ob&s;ervations, and practices without, are but to bring the life within, which is to be found again there, where it was lo&s;t, and &s;till lies &s;lain and hid, even in the field or hou&s;e where it was lo&s;t. And he that &s;eeks abroad, never finds it, but when the candle is lighted in his own hou&s;e, and he &s;earches narrowly in the field, in his own heart, and the eternal eye begins to open in him; then he cries God was in this place, and I was not aware of it. Ah! how the enemy bewitched me, to run from mountain to mountain! and from hill to hill! and hath hereby covered my eye from beholding the mountain of the Lord's hou&s;e, and from feeling the &s;pring of my life, which I further and further ran from, all the while I was &s;eeking abroad. Therefore, O ye profe&s;&s;ors, be not &s;o conceited like the Jews, and running after them into their de&s;olation and mi&s;ery, but learn wi&s;|dom by their fall! Do not you &s;et up their ordinances and &s;criptures, after the manner they &s;et up theirs; for this is your danger, for this I clearly, in the light of the Lord, te&s;tify to you, that if ye gather a know|ledge and wi&s;dom from the letter of the &s;criptures, after the manner that they did, without knowledge
<PB N="46" REF="019435_0045_0FABAC72E2587330">
from the word within, and without a light within from that word, ye lo&s;e the living faith; ye are but dead branches, and your knowledge of &s;criptures, and practices, and faith, and duties, &amp;c. that ye here hold and ob&s;erve, are but for the fire; and the flames of eternal wrath &s;hall kindle more fiercely upon you becau&s;e of them, than upon the Jews; for ye &s;tumble at the &s;ame &s;tumbling-&s;tone at which they &s;tumbled and fell, and it will fall upon you al&s;o. And as you have more &s;criptures than they had, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e experience of their fall to warn you, &s;o your de&s;truction will be exceeding dreadful if you neglect &s;o great &s;alvation; whereof at this day there are &s;o many living and powerful witne&s;&s;es, as they are known and owned to be in the light of the Lord, though de&s;pi&s;|ed in your exalted and conceited wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>Now to help any hone&s;t and &s;ingle hearts among you over this great &s;tumbling-block of a light within, con&s;ider the&s;e few things:</P>
<P N="1">1. That all the knowledge, all the true know|ledge, that ever ye had of God, was from a light within. I do not deny that ye might receive your knowledge through the &s;criptures, and &s;ome warmth formerly in tho&s;e things which ye call ordinances and duties; but that whereby ye received the know|ledge was the light within, the eye that God &s;ecretly opened in your &s;pirits. This was the way ye then came by it, though ye perhaps might feel the thing, but not know how ye came by it; even as a babe may &s;ee truly, but doth not under&s;tand its own eye, or know how it &s;ees.</P>
<P N="2">2. While this eye was kept open in you, your knowledge was true in its mea&s;ure, and &s;erviceable to you, and did draw you nearer to God, making you truly tender, meek, &s;weet, humble, patient,
<PB N="47" REF="019435_0046_0FABAC739C2932B0">
loving, gentle, and of precious breathing towards God, and after righteou&s;ne&s;s. Oh! how lovely were you to God in this &s;tate? When I&s;rael was a child, I loved him. God remembereth at this day the kindne&s;s of your youth, and is &s;eeking after you. Oh! why do you &s;o harden your hearts again&s;t him?</P>
<P N="3">3. That where-ever this eye is &s;hut, the virtue of the true knowledge is lo&s;t, and the &s;weet fruits thereof wither. The outward part of the knowledge may be retained; yea, perhaps much increa&s;ed, but the life is gone, and the pure &s;weet &s;avourine&s;s, to God, vani&s;hed. And if this eye were but a little opened again&s;t you, your death and un&s;avourine&s;s might &s;oon be &s;een and felt in you, in all your knowledge, duties, ordinances; yea, in your very graces and experiences. You have a faith &s;till; yea, but it wants the &s;avour of your former faith: Ye have &s;ome kind of love, gentlene&s;s, and meekne&s;s; yea, but it is only a thing formed by the fle&s;hly wi&s;|dom and rea&s;oning, but not natural from the living &s;pring, not &s;uch as ye once felt, &amp;c. for the true and living eye being &s;hut, that which is then be&s;t, or afterwards attained, is held but in the dead part, and &s;erves but to feed death.</P>
<P N="4">4. The great work and de&s;ign of the enemy of your &s;ouls, is not to &s;teal away the bulk of your knowledge, or to draw you from ordinances or du|ties; but to &s;teal the life out of your &s;pirits. This I have experienced from my childhood: I might &s;till have knowledge enough of any kind; but that which I wanted was life, and I was &s;till &s;ick under all the &s;orts of knowledge that ever I met with, and under all ordinances and duties, for want of life. The Lord had given my &s;oul a ta&s;te of true life, whereby I became un&s;atisfied without it, and no
<PB N="48" REF="019435_0047_0FABAC75C8DEF730">
manner of knowledge or enjoyment could take me up by the way: Yea, when through extremity I &s;eemed willing to be content with any thing; yet &s;till my heart was &s;ick after that one thing, which alone could truly ea&s;e and &s;atisfy it. Now if the enemy can prevail herein, to blind the inward eye, and &s;teal away the life within, he hath enough. Then abound as much as thou wilt in knowledge, in zeal, in duties, in ordinances, in reading &s;criptures, praying, meditating, &amp;c. thou art the &s;urer his here|by, and &s;o much the better &s;ervant to him; for how much the richer thou art in knowledge, experiences, hopes, and a&s;&s;urance, without the life or power, &s;o much the more acceptable, and honorable, and u&s;e|ful, art thou in his kingdom.</P>
<P>Therefore &s;ee where ye are; is the inward eye open in you? Do you know the light within? Sure|ly he that &s;ees by a light within, can hardly &s;peak evil of it. Or hath the enemy, by &s;ome of his arti|fices, drawn a veil over that eye wherewith once ye &s;aw in &s;ome mea&s;ure? Oh! be not &s;light in a matter of &s;o great weight! Oh! plea&s;e not your&s;elves with the eye of the peri&s;hing wi&s;dom, with death's eye, and with death's knowledge of &s;criptures, and the Son of God; which &s;peaks great words of the &s;ame of true wi&s;dom, but is a &s;tranger and enemy to the thing! Oh! life is precious! eternal life is pre|cious! To have the word of God abiding in the heart, and to feel the true light give the true life, who can &s;et a value on this? Ah! do not lo&s;e your &s;ouls for a trifle, for a little &s;uch knowledge of the &s;criptures, as the earthly part can gather!</P>
<P>This I cannot but exceedingly de&s;pi&s;e, although the &s;criptures I truly honor, for their te&s;timony of that whereby I live. If ye &s;ee not the way of life
<PB N="49" REF="019435_0048_0FABAC790EA782B8">
by the inward light, which alone can &s;hew it, ye lo&s;e your &s;ouls. If the god of the world hath blinded that eye in you, what are all your trea&s;ures of wi&s;|dom and knowledge? What are all your hopes? And what will become of you? All the&s;e &s;parks of your own kindling from &s;cripture, will not &s;ecure you from the bed of &s;orrow. O ye &s;everal &s;orts of profe&s;&s;ors, why will ye die with the uncircumci&s;ed? Why will ye go down into the pit, among them that know not the Lord?</P>
<P>But what &s;hall I &s;ay to this generation? The &s;pi|ritually-wi&s;e fore&s;eeth the &s;torm and hideth him&s;elf; but the &s;piritually-fooli&s;h run on headily, and are puni&s;hed. The clouds have long been gathering; but the &s;ick eye cannot di&s;cern the &s;igns of the times and &s;ea&s;ons; and &s;o becau&s;e judgment comes not as men expected, they grow hard, and wear off the &s;en&s;e wherewith they were &s;omewhat affected at the fir&s;t threatening of it, but a&s;&s;uredly both judgment and mercy ha&s;ten, and they will come, and will not tarry.</P>
<P>For the &s;ame Lord God Almighty, which con|founded the heathen Babel, when their &s;ins and vain confidence were ripe, which they built to prevent any future flood, for though they once had the true knowledge of God from an inward light, <HI>Rom.</HI> i. 21, yet they &s;oon left that, not liking to retain God in their knowledge, ver. 28, but running out into ima|ginations, and &s;o building a Babel, whereby their fooli&s;h hearts became darkened to the light which God had made to &s;hine in them; which &s;hewed what might be known of God unto them, ver. 19. Yea, the Lord God which overthrew the Jews Babel, which they had built from their knowledge of the laws and ordinances of Mo&s;es, and the &s;criptures written to them, they running out into imaginations
<PB N="50" REF="019435_0049_0FABAC79F6D235D0">
al&s;o, whereby they likewi&s;e thought to prevent the overflowing &s;courge from coming near them, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> xxviii. 15, the &s;ame God will overthrow the Chri&s;tians Babel, which they have built from the prophets and apo&s;tles words, by their own imaginations and con|ceivings in the high-mindedne&s;s, out of the fear, whereby they think to e&s;cape the deluge of eternal wrath. For their city al&s;o &s;hall be thrown down with violence, and &s;hall be found no more at all, <HI>Rev.</HI> xviii. 21. And the great work of this day is to di&s;cover the rottenne&s;s of their wall, and the untempered|ne&s;s of the mortar wherewith they have daubed it. He that readeth, let him under&s;tand; but the un|circumci&s;ed in heart and ears cannot.</P>
<P>"But the Lord will manife&s;t all things in his time, and give his truth a pa&s;&s;age in the earth, and his peo|ple a quiet habitation therein, how black &s;oever the face of things now appear, as relating to them. Oh! how happy will the day be, when the Lord &s;hall have wrought down the &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit in man, and &s;hall have rai&s;ed up his own noble and equal princi|ple. Then &s;hall righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;pring up and &s;pread abroad throughout the nations; and the work of righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall be peace, and the effect of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, quietne&s;s, and a&s;&s;urance for ever."</P>

<Q>Where is the wi&s;e? Where is the &s;cribe? Where is the di&s;puter of this world? Hath not God made fooli&s;h the wi&s;dom of this world?</Q>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE have always been the enemies and oppo&s;ers of truth, and &s;etters up of fal&s;e images thereof in all ages; the wi&s;e, the learned, the great di&s;putants. To the&s;e truth has &s;till been mean and contemptible, their eye hath &s;till over|looked it, and their imaginations have &s;till outrun it, finding out &s;omewhat el&s;e in the &s;tead thereof; for which they have been &s;till able and vigorous to contend, and again&s;t the truth it&s;elf. And indeed how can the wi&s;e eye &s;ee that, how can the learned eye acknowledge that, which comes quite out of the way of its knowledge and learning, even in a path that it is not at all acquainted with? Wi&s;dom is ju&s;tified of her children. Tho&s;e that are wi&s;e to &s;alvation, tho&s;e that are learned in the &s;pirit, tho&s;e that can di&s;pute in the power of the life and demon|&s;tration of the &s;pirit, the&s;e know her habitation, and her out-goings, and can own her in every age, and in every di&s;pen&s;ation and coming forth: But the wi&s;e and learned of this world are &s;hut out of this wi&s;dom, and in all the &s;earches after truth cannot find her; and if at any time they do find and ta&s;te &s;omewhat of her, yet they cannot keep her; but the wi&s;dom, and learning, and &s;trength of the earth|ly

part in them, &s;oon betrays and makes a prey of the &s;implicity that is in Chri&s;t, and of his pure go&s;pel; which cannot be comprehended, nor will take up a dwelling-place with this wi&s;dom, but brings it to nothing, tramples upon it, and keeps it down for ever, where it abides.</P>
<P>Three &s;orts of enemies, of the wi&s;e, the learned, the great di&s;putants, truth always had. Fir&s;t, of &s;uch as have denied the true form of knowledge and wor&s;hip. Secondly, of &s;uch as have owned the form, but denied the power. Thirdly, of &s;uch as have had a ta&s;te of the power, but afterwards erred from it; and &s;o held that, which they had once a true ta&s;te of, in the unrighteous part, and likewi&s;e added to it by their own imaginations.</P>
<P>When I&s;rael was in Egypt, that poor illiterate company of brick-makers, in bondage under that wi&s;e people, the Egyptians, with all their wi&s;dom, could not own their God, or their wor&s;hip; but their God was an unknown being to all that wi&s;dom, <HI>Ex.</HI> v. 2, and his wor&s;hip and &s;acrifice the abomination of their eyes, <HI>Ex.</HI> viii. 26. And Jannes and Jambres, with other wi&s;e magicians, with&s;tood the appearance of God; and Pharaoh and his people, with their wi&s;dom, thought to have kept God's I&s;|rael from multiplying, <HI>Ex.</HI> i. 10, and to have held I&s;rael &s;till under their &s;ervitude, after the Lord was ri&s;en to &s;tretch out his arm for their deliverance, <HI>Ex.</HI> v. 8, 9. And how did all the wi&s;e nations &s;till watch to make a prey of God's Jeru&s;alem? How did they count the towers? How often did they think to divide the &s;poil? <HI>Judg,</HI> v. 28 <HI>I&s;a.</HI> xxxiii. 18. How did Senacherib and Rab&s;heka make her their own? And when the Lord did at any time give Jacob for a &s;poil, and I&s;rael to the robbers, how did they think
<PB N="54" REF="019435_0053_0FABAC7CB566B338">
to keep her under for ever? The wi&s;e A&s;&s;yrian, the Moabite, the Ammonite, the Edomite, the Phi|li&s;tine, the Amalekite, the wi&s;e Babylonian, or Chal|dean, thought to keep her under, as Pharaoh had done, even till their wi&s;dom and knowledge pervert|ed them al&s;o, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> xlvii. 18; and the prince of Tyre, who was wi&s;er than Daniel, <HI>Ezek.</HI> xxviii. 3, he al&s;o could in&s;ult over Jeru&s;alem, and rejoice at her down|fall and captivity, chap. xxvi. 2.</P>
<P>But to come clo&s;er; come to I&s;rael it&s;elf. That people, by all the wi&s;dom it could gather from the law, by all the experiences it had had of God's pow|er, by all the faith that was wrought in them upon deliverances, yet had not eyes to &s;ee, nor ears to hear, nor hearts to perceive; but were a people that did always err in their hearts, and did not under|&s;tand the way of truth and peace. The prophets among them &s;till fools; yea, the &s;piritual man mad, <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> ix. 7. The prie&s;ts were generally ignorant of the Lord, for though they had the ark of his pre&s;ence, his tabernacle, his temple, altar, &s;acrifices, wor&s;hip, &amp;c. yet they did not know where he was, nor did en|quire after him, but contented them&s;elves with a form of knowledge and wor&s;hip. And they that handled the law, knew not him that gave the law, and was the &s;ole true interpreter of the law; but the pa&s;tors tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed again&s;t him, and the prophets prophe&s;ied by another &s;pirit, <HI>Jer.</HI> ii. 8. They were wi&s;e, and did abound in their own mean|ings, gue&s;&s;ings, and gathered knowledge; but they knew not the truth, no not of the letter according to the law, and according to that light which God &s;ometimes cau&s;ed to &s;hine among them from his prophets. Hence it was that that people, with their rulers, their teachers, their prie&s;ts, their prophets, were generally enemies to the prophets whom God
<PB N="55" REF="019435_0054_0FABAC8014C590E0">
rai&s;ed up, hating, per&s;ecuting, impri&s;oning, &s;toning them, &amp;c. The prophets of God, that &s;pake his truth in his wi&s;dom, in his life and power, in the demon&s;tration of his &s;pirit, they could not away with; the&s;e were fools with them, the&s;e were mad|men with them, 2 <HI>Kings,</HI> ix. 11, <HI>Jer.</HI> xxix. 26. The&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">re poor illiterate herd&s;men and ploughmen; they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d learned men, that were brought up at the &s;chools <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the prophets, that could prophe&s;y divine things, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eet things, that could open the law learnedly: The&s;e prophets and the prie&s;ts the rulers cheri&s;hed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d the people loved, <HI>Jer.</HI> v. 31, and xxiii. 26, 27, <HI>Ezek.</HI> xiii. 3, &amp;c. Yea, among that people &s;uch as had a ta&s;te of the truth, as Korah, Dathan and Abiram might have, for &s;urely it was not a &s;mall matter that could &s;o lift them up to oppo&s;e Mo&s;es and Aaron in that manner, and to &s;tand out the conte&s;t again&s;t them, even in the Lord's pre&s;ence, <HI>Numb.</HI> xvi. 18, but an apprehen&s;ion of God's being on their &s;ide, from &s;ome appearance of his to them, and as Balaam had, who&s;e eyes were opened to &s;ee the beauty of the tents of Jacob; yet the&s;e, through the prevailing of the fle&s;hly lu&s;ts and wi&s;dom, be|come enemies, and try always to prevail over I&s;rael, even over the truth, and over the power. It pre&s;ent|ly hangs down its head: Nay, if he do but &s;o much as hide his face, it is troubled; and all the fullne&s;s, which it immediately before had from God, is not able to keep up its life one moment; but it pants, and fails, and withers, until a new &s;upply of refre&s;h|ment be admini&s;tered to it. And he that knows this in any mea&s;ure will not wonder at the di&s;tre&s;s and mi&s;ery of &s;uch, for want of God's pre&s;ence; and at their cryings out after the &s;pring of their life, even as the hart panteth after the water-brooks, though
<PB N="56" REF="019435_0055_0FABAC81AEAEB2E8">
they &s;hould have fullne&s;s of all outward things, yea, and al&s;o fullne&s;s of knowledge in things of religion, even concerning all conditions and e&s;tates. The thing that I wanted in my great mi&s;ery, it was not outward knowledge, it was not experience of God's mercy and goodne&s;s; but this I wanted, the i&s;&s;uings forth of his fre&s;h life, and livingly to know where to wait for it, and livingly to know it when it appear|ed: For it was &s;till near me all the time of my darkne&s;s, and did pre&s;erve me, and appear unto me; but I livingly knew it not, but thought I would be wi&s;er than others: For I &s;aw many deceived, and &s;o I would not own it in &s;uch a way as it then appeared in me, le&s;t I al&s;o &s;hould be deceived like others; but waited for &s;uch an appearance as could not be que&s;tioned by the fle&s;hly wi&s;dom. And he that waits for that, and &s;o de&s;pi&s;es the day of &s;mall things, cannot but refu&s;e the little &s;eed; and &s;o, not being received into his earth, it can never grow up in him into a great tree; whereby the glory of the kingdom will be hid from him, and he &s;hut out of it, when others enter into and &s;it down in it. Therefore, he that will be wi&s;e, let him become a fool, that he may be wi&s;e; let him receive that for his light, his king, his guide, which man's wi&s;dom never did, nor never will own. He that ever looks to enjoy the comforter, let him receive the reprover, the con|vincer of &s;in, and wait for his law of judging him through the whole cour&s;e of his &s;inful &s;tate and nature, pa&s;&s;ing along with him through the whole condemna|tion, until he arrive with him at the ju&s;tification of the life, which the fle&s;hly wi&s;dom, nor any of his knowledge of the things of God, as they are held in the fle&s;hly part, mu&s;t never arrive with him at.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="019435_0056_0FABAC82C8D8ADD0">Hath not God made fooli&s;h the wi&s;dom of this world?</P>
<P>The wi&s;dom of this world is precious in the eye of the world; and the wi&s;dom of God, in his poor, weak, de&s;pi&s;ed earthen ve&s;&s;els, is &s;till fooli&s;hne&s;s with them; but the Lord &s;o orders it, that he &s;till ju&s;tifies his de|&s;pi&s;ed wi&s;dom in his de&s;pi&s;ed ve&s;&s;els, and makes the wi&s;dom of the world appear fooli&s;h to all the &s;ingle and upright-hearted who thir&s;t after, and wait for the revelation of his truth. Now two ways e&s;pecially the Lord makes the folly of this world's wi&s;dom ap|pear:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, in that by all their wi&s;dom they cannot find out the true knowledge of God, ver. 21. The world by wi&s;dom knew not God. Though there be an ex|ceeding de&s;ire kindled in them to know God; though they take all the ways that heart can imagine to attain their de&s;ires; though they &s;tudy and meditate ever &s;o hard; though they get ever &s;o many arts and lan|guages; nay, though they read the very &s;criptures ever &s;o diligently; though they keep ever &s;o &s;trict to the forms of church orders and di&s;ciplines; even though they labour in the very fire; yet what they get, what they gather, what they under&s;tand, what they comprehend by this wi&s;dom, it is all but very vanity, <HI>Heb.</HI> ii. 13. It reaches not the immortal, it nouri&s;hes not the immortal, it &s;atisfies not the &s;oul, it refre&s;hes not the &s;eed; but only feeds and plea&s;es the earthly part, the earthly under&s;tanding, the earth|ly mind, the earthly de&s;ires and affections; even the man's part, the man's &s;pirit, the man's nature; which though elevated and rai&s;ed ever &s;o high, is &s;till but earth.</P>
<P>Secondly, in that all their wi&s;dom cannot teach them to come down to, to &s;ubmit to, to come
<PB N="58" REF="019435_0057_0FABAC8367A8E0B8">
into God's way of having their wi&s;dom crucified, and that rai&s;ed up in them which might receive the truth. This they can never learn in the fle&s;hly wi&s;dom. They may indeed come thus far, even to &s;ee that there is no way of entrance but by death; and to &s;eek death, that they may enter into the life, but they cannot find it. The &s;eed of Jacob, in his &s;eeking, mi&s;&s;es not; but this &s;eeker never finds; to this a&s;ker it is never given, and to this knocker it is never opened: And that is it which makes this wi&s;dom in every appearance, in every &s;ort of profe&s;&s;ion and &s;ect of profe&s;&s;ors, &s;o rage at the &s;eed of Jacob, even becau&s;e it finds it&s;elf &s;till &s;hut out of the life into which an entrance is ad|mini&s;tered to the &s;eed. And how can that which would fain have the kingdom, but rage again&s;t that which takes the inheritance from it? How can every &s;ort of profe&s;&s;ors but &s;trive to &s;lay the heir, that the inheritance may be theirs? Were it not for the living &s;eed, and the living power and virtue, which break forth in them and among them, the religion and wor|&s;hip of the fir&s;t birth might pa&s;s for current; but this is it which darkens the glory of all profe&s;&s;ions and profe&s;&s;ors upon the earth, even that living thing which God hath begotten in his people, and his living pre&s;ence with it, and ble&s;&s;ing upon it. At this all the zealous &s;acrificers, teachers and pro|fe&s;&s;ors, out of the life, rage and are mad, and would break the cords and bands wherewith this &s;trives to bind them unto God's altar.</P>
<P>Now look over all ages; could the wi&s;e heathen &s;toop to God's di&s;pen&s;ation to the Jews? Was it not fooli&s;hne&s;s and abomination to them? Or could the wi&s;e Jews &s;toop to the law within, to the word in the heart, although directed thereto by Mo&s;es, <HI>Deut.</HI> xxx. 14, to learn there to do ju&s;tly, to love mercy,
<PB N="59" REF="019435_0058_0FABAC84229A42D8">
and to walk humbly with their God? <HI>Micah</HI> vi. 8. Could they wait there to have their hearts circum|ci&s;ed by that word of power, and &s;o to be wa&s;hed and made clean? Nay, were they not drowned in the outward &s;acrifices, temple, incen&s;e, new-moons and &s;abbaths, and &s;uch kind of ob&s;ervations, and could not hear the truth of the Lord as it was delivered by Mo&s;es, nor as it was opened by the prophets? <HI>I&s;a.</HI> i. 2. So that this people, &s;eeking to know the Lord from the letter, by this wi&s;dom, could never come to the knowledge of him, but the place of his light and wi&s;dom was hid from them.</P>
<P>Again, when Chri&s;t came (in the days that are pa&s;t) and the kingdom was preached, and the ever|la&s;ting way of redemption and &s;alvation made mani|fe&s;t, could the wi&s;e eye in the Greeks, or the wi&s;e eye in the Jews, &s;ee it? Did not the Greeks &s;hut them&s;elves out by a wi&s;dom above the letter (as they thought) and the Jews by a knowledge and wi&s;dom which they had gathered out of the letter? How wi&s;e were they from the letter to rea&s;on again&s;t the king of life? This man cannot be of God, for he is a breaker of his &s;abbath. He is a Nazarite, and can any good thing come out of Nazareth? He &s;aith the &s;on of man mu&s;t be lifted up, but we read that Chri&s;t abideth for ever.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle Jude compares &s;uch to the angels that kept not their fir&s;t e&s;tate; the angels that fell had a place and &s;tanding once in the truth, but they kept it not, they abode not in the truth, but fell from it, and &s;o became devils, enemies to the truth from which they fell: So tho&s;e that fall from the truth, from the power, from the living virtue whereof they once ta&s;ted, from the true wi&s;dom which once appeared to them, and begun to &s;ea&s;on and &s;avour them, in
<PB N="60" REF="019435_0059_0FABAC84E6E32788">
their fallen wi&s;dom they become the greate&s;t enemies, the greate&s;t accu&s;ers, the greate&s;t oppo&s;ers, and the &s;tiffe&s;t maintainers of a fal&s;e image of that truth which they once had &s;ome knowledge of, and &s;ome unity with. Thus it was in the Jewi&s;h &s;tate: Now come to the apo&s;tles days. Fir&s;t, they had all the wi&s;e men of that age again&s;t them; all the wi&s;e Greeks, all the wi&s;e Jews, the learned men, the able di&s;pu|tants of all &s;orts. The Greeks could not find wi&s;dom in that knowledge of Chri&s;t which they held forth, nor the Jews could not find power in it, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> i. 22; and &s;o one accounted it fooli&s;hne&s;s, the other &s;tumbled at it, ver. 23. There were many &s;orts and &s;ects of wi&s;e men among the Jews, but not one &s;ort could own the truth, though they were looking for it, &s;earching the &s;criptures about it, and di&s;puting con|cerning it. The very thing then in agitation and en|quiry among them was, when the kingdom of God &s;hould come. The king him&s;elf directs them where it was, that they might know where to expect and wait for it, <HI>Luke</HI> xvii. 21, and in many parables opens it to them; but it was &s;till hid from the eye of that wi&s;dom wherewith they did &s;trive to &s;ee, under&s;tand and comprehend it. So that all the &s;everal &s;orts of wi&s;e men of that age, even tho&s;e who were admirers of the law and prophets, yet were &s;trangers and ene|mies to the truth, becau&s;e they joined to that wi&s;dom, and to that learning and comprehen&s;ion of the &s;crip|tures, out of the &s;ight whereof it came.</P>
<P>Secondly, for &s;uch as did own Chri&s;t after the fle&s;h, &s;uch as were convinced by his miracles, as Nicode|mus and many of the more hone&s;t &s;ort of the Jews were; yet Chri&s;t did not commit him&s;elf to them, <HI>John</HI> ii. 24. He knew this faith, and this owning of him, which was founded upon the wi&s;dom and inge|nuity
<PB N="61" REF="019435_0060_0FABAC859E05F190">
of the creature, would fail; and &s;o he would not own it in Nicodemus, but bids him look after the new birth, <HI>John</HI> iii. 2, 3; nor in &s;uch as followed him up and down, upon this or any other fle&s;hly ac|count; but &s;ometimes withdrew, and hid him&s;elf from them, <HI>Luke</HI> v. 16, <HI>John</HI> vi. 14, 15; and &s;ome|times preached doctrines which &s;tumbled them, and made them withdraw from him, <HI>John</HI> vi. 66. And &s;o in the apo&s;tles days there were many that could get the form, and gain advantage thereby to the fle&s;hly wi&s;dom, to with&s;tand the power, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> iii. 5. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> xi. 13.</P>
<P>Thirdly, there were &s;uch as had ta&s;ted of the hea|venly gift, and of the powers of the world to come, and yet fell away, <HI>Heb.</HI> vi. 4&mdash;6. There were &s;uch as denied the Lord who bought them, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> ii. 1, &s;uch as fell from the love of the truth, to the love of the world again, ver. 22, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> iv. 10.</P>
<P>Such as had a &s;tanding in the church's heaven (like the angels which fell) but kept not their habitation, but were &s;wept down from thence to the earth by the dragon's tail, <HI>Rev.</HI> xii. iv. the&s;e are the noble&s;t cham|pions (in the earthly wi&s;dom, and for a corrupt e&s;tate and fal&s;e image) of all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Now as the prophets of God among the Jews had the&s;e enemies, and as the apo&s;tles al&s;o had the&s;e ene|mies, &s;o all along the apo&s;ta&s;y the&s;e enemies have been rife. The witne&s;&s;es have had a wi&s;e &s;ort of direct oppo&s;ers among the Papi&s;ts, a wi&s;e &s;ort of &s;ecret underminers among the Prote&s;tants, and al&s;o another wi&s;e &s;ort of them among them&s;elves, as had &s;ome ta&s;te of the truth, but departed from the power of it into the earthly wi&s;dom, and under&s;tanding; and this la&s;t &s;ort fight more furiou&s;ly and more vehemently again&s;t the truth, and are more &s;ubtle to a&s;&s;ault it,
<PB N="62" REF="019435_0061_0FABAC86807ED8A8">
than the other two. Oh! there is no &s;uch bitter, deadly enemy to Chri&s;t and his truth, as he who once had &s;ome ta&s;te of the virtue of it, and is now turned from it into the earth, into the wi&s;dom and love of the world, and yet &s;till holds &s;ome of the no|tion of that truth, whereof he once felt the power, in the earthly part.</P>
<P>To come yet clo&s;er&punc; There is in every man, not tho|roughly &s;anctified, that wi&s;dom which is not of God; that wi&s;dom from which God hides his precious truths; which wi&s;dom lies ready to catch every di&s;covery and revelation of truth to him, that it might improve it, and grow rich and wi&s;e by it. Now this wi&s;dom cannot attain to the knowledge of any of the things of God; neither can this wi&s;dom keep the true knowledge; but whatever this wi&s;dom catcheth, it pre&s;ently corrupts. The true wi&s;dom, the true light, the true knowledge of Chri&s;t, is like the manna in the wilderne&s;s; it daily comes down from heaven, and mu&s;t daily be gathered fre&s;h. The true light &s;prings from the life, and mu&s;t be held in the life, in the ve&s;&s;el which the life forms, in the new bottle, in the new under&s;tanding; not in the fle&s;hly part, nay, not in the natural part; for as the natural man cannot receive the things of the &s;pirit, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> ii. 14, &s;o neither can he retain them. The old &s;tore|hou&s;e, into which earthly things were gathered, mu&s;t be burnt up, and not made a trea&s;ury for the things of God; but the new under&s;tanding, which is given by him that is true, 1 <HI>John,</HI> v. 20, which new forms and pre&s;erves, and is all in the natural. Sink out of the earthly part, and read, that thou maye&s;t be able to &s;ay within thy&s;elf, and concerning thy&s;elf, where is the wi&s;e? Where is the &s;cribe? Where is the di&s;puter?</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="019435_0062_0FABAC8822CB5D28">The wi&s;e part, the knowing part, the reaching part, in every man, will be putting forth its hand to gather of the tree of life; but what hath it ever been able to gather? I know men may gather notions of any kind, of any &s;ect, of any &s;ort of profe&s;&s;ors, of any ap|pearance or di&s;pen&s;ation; but who is able to come near the life, to touch the power, the truth, the everla&s;ting &s;pring, or any &s;tream or drop of water that i&s;&s;ues from it? And he who hath a true touch or ta&s;te thereof given him, can his wi&s;dom add to it? Nay, can he &s;o much as retain it? David had a true &s;en&s;e and experience of this, who cried out, O continue thy loving kindne&s;s to them that know thee, and thy righteou&s;ne&s;s to the upright in heart. Indeed if he like not to retain the thing it&s;elf in his knowledge, he may improve the no|tion, and bend that to the di&s;po&s;ition of the earthly part in him&s;elf and others; but this is not the truth, but a dead image, or a dead remembrance of what once was truly living. Oh! how doth the &s;oul that is begot|ten of the divine breath, that is born of the living power and virtue, depend upon God for his con|tinual breathing? There is nothing that hath &s;o much from God, and yet nothing is &s;o little able to live without him. If he withdraws from it, he is again&s;t God's temple, again&s;t God's day of wor&s;hip, gives his di&s;ciples &s;uch &s;cope and liberty, as neither the Phari&s;ees nor John gave their di&s;ciples; but re|viles our &s;trict and godly teachers and expounders of the law, calling them hypocrites, blind guides, &amp;c. And mark with what a rough &s;evere &s;pirit he reproves them; whereas they call him ma&s;ter, and &s;peak mildly and gently to him.

<HEAD>A <HI>WARNING,</HI> in the Bonds of Love, to the Rulers, Teachers, and People of this Nation, con|cerning their Church and Mini&s;try.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>THAT there was a fight between the dragon and his angels, and Michael and his angels, concerning the new-te&s;tament church and mini&s;try, is manife&s;t even from the letter of the &s;criptures, <HI>Rev.</HI> xii.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>That the dragon and his angels, though they could not get the better, as relating to the power, yet they did get the better as relating to the form, in&s;omuch as that they overcame the third part of the true mini&s;ters, and drew them from their &s;tanding in the firmament of God's power, off to their earth|ly mini&s;try; and that the true church her&s;elf al&s;o was fain to fly into the wilderne&s;s, from the face of the dragon, for her &s;afety and pre&s;ervation, where &s;he was to be nouri&s;hed and fed by God, all the time of Antichri&s;t's reign; this likewi&s;e is not only re|vealed in the &s;pirit, but is al&s;o manife&s;t from the letter, <HI>Rev.</HI> xii.</P>
<P>That after this flight of the true church, and overcoming of the true mini&s;try, the dragon erected his fal&s;e church and mini&s;try, which had but at be&s;t the form without the power, over all nations, peo|ples, multitudes and tongues; this is al&s;o as evident, to them that read the prophecies of the revelations, in the light of that &s;pirit in which they were wrote. Is not the fal&s;e woman, after the true woman was fled, manife&s;tly de&s;cribed, <HI>Rev.</HI> xvii. which hath a bewitch|ing of fornications? ver. 2, 4. Mark &s;he has not the true cup of, her cup is not filled with the wine of the kingdom, it is not the cup of the true &s;pou&s;e, who keeps cha&s;te and loyal to her hu&s;band, but the cup of fornication, wherein is a form of doctrine&punc;
<PB N="68" REF="019435_0066_0FABAC8D14F4DE40">
and di&s;cipline, and order, and church government, which leads from the life, which bewitches from the power, which lulls a&s;leep in a form of profe&s;|&s;ion and wor&s;hip of Chri&s;t, without knowledge of, guidance by, and &s;ubjection to his &s;pirit. And this is the government, mini&s;try, and way of Antichri&s;t, wherever it is found; how curiou&s;ly &s;oever the cup be gilded, yet it is but the cup of fornication, which bewitcheth the heart with its golden appearance, and then leads it into adultery from the life.</P>
<P>And the dragon doth not only &s;et up a fal&s;e church over the nations, in many parts whereof the truth had before appeared, <HI>Rev.</HI> xvii. 15, but a fal&s;e mini&s;try al&s;o.</P>
<P>There is a fal&s;e prophet, which deceiveth with miracles and fal&s;e appearances of truth, advanced in this corrupt &s;tate; which fal&s;e prophet continues and upholds his deceit over the nations, till the mighty appearance of Chri&s;t, in &s;pirit and power, doth judge him, <HI>Rev.</HI> xix. 20, 2 <HI>The&s;&s;.</HI> ii. 8. There is a bea&s;t, with horns like a lamb, who doth great wonders, &s;o that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth, in the &s;ight of men, and de|ceiveth them that dwell on the earth, &amp;c. <HI>Rev.</HI> xiii. 13, 14. In&s;omuch that he draws the kings and inhabiters of the earth, in a my&s;tery of deceit, into the bed of whoredom and fal&s;e wor&s;hip, in&s;tead of the pure way of life, and pure wor&s;hip of the living God, in his &s;pirit, and in his truth, <HI>Rev.</HI> xvii. 2.</P>
<P>Is it not further manife&s;t, that this fal&s;e church and fal&s;e mini&s;try, &s;et up in the world by the power of the dragon, per&s;ecuted God's witne&s;&s;es to the truth in all the ages of Antichri&s;t's reign? So &s;oon as the church was fled into the wilderne&s;s, the dragon forthwith went to make war with the rem|nant

of her &s;eed which keep the commandments of God, and had the te&s;timony of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>Rev.</HI> xii. 17. And it was given unto him to make war with the &s;aints, and to overcome them, and power was given him over all kindreds, tongues and nations. And all that dwell upon the earth &s;hall wor&s;hip him, who&s;e names are not written in the book of life, of the Lamb &s;lain from the foundation of the world; if any man have an ear, let him hear, <HI>Rev.</HI> xiii. 7, 8, 9.

Yea, the woman, the fal&s;e church, which the dragon had &s;et up, by his power in the nations, in|&s;tead of the true, was drunken with the blood of the &s;aints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Je&s;us, <HI>Rev.</HI> xvii. 6.

For let but the &s;pirit and power appear, the form with|out the power is &s;oon detected to be what it is.

<P>Now though the Lord hath &s;uffered this fal&s;e church and fal&s;e prophet to reign long in the dragon's power, and to revile and per&s;ecute his poor lambs, in every age of Antichri&s;t's reign; yet the Lord hath appoint|ed a &s;ea&s;on to judge this fal&s;e church, <HI>Rev.</HI> xvii. 1, to ca&s;t the fal&s;e prophet into the lake, <HI>Rev.</HI> xix. 20.

<P>Oh! how deeply doth it concern this land! her rulers, her teachers, yea the whole people thereof, to con&s;ider their ways, to con&s;ider their wor&s;hip, to con&s;ider their church-&s;tate, to con&s;ider their mini&s;try, that they be not overwhelmed at unawares in the bit|ter wrath of the Almighty, before which there is no &s;tanding?

The go&s;pel, the eternal truth, the true church, the true mini&s;try, are all &s;piritual, not new &s;hadows, as the things under the mini&s;tration of the law were, but the &s;pirit and &s;ub&s;tance, and they can only be &s;een by the &s;piritual eye of the children of wi&s;dom. The wi&s;e and diligent enquirers into the comprehending part, cannot find the womb or the way of life, or the way of the wor|&s;hip of that which is begotten in the life, or God's way of mini&s;try, which he hath appointed for the feeding and pre&s;erving of the life. The prophets of old could not be known, di&s;cerned, or owned, by the fle&s;hly eye of ob&s;ervation in I&s;rael after the fle&s;h, but they &s;till rejected them, e&s;teeming and magnify|ing the fal&s;e prophets above them; how much le&s;s can the prophets and mini&s;ters of the new-te&s;tament be &s;een by man's eye? Are they the prophets and mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, which a nation cries up for &s;uch, and which the eye of wi&s;e men therein admires, and pitches upon?

but more e&s;pecially by &s;etting up an invented form of godline&s;s, and per&s;ecuting the power, and to whom it is not yet reconciled in this matter, nor found &s;o much as willing to be reconciled.</P>
<P>The Lord God of heaven and earth, of glory, of maje&s;ty, of everla&s;ting power, victory and domi|nion over all, who made both heaven and earth, and hath the command of all things therein, he di&s;po&s;eth of nations, of governments, of earthly powers, ac|cording to his plea&s;ure, and who may &s;ay unto him, what doe&s;t thou? Who may implead him for making a rich nation poor? A &s;trong nation weak? Or for bringing down the high and mighty, the &s;trong, &s;tout, honorable, and noble in a nation, and exalting the poor, the mean, the per&s;ecuted? And if he turn his hand again, and lay them flat whom he had lifted up, and exalt the other even un|looked for, who can with&s;tand him, or who can con|tradict him? Now what is in the Lord's heart, who is thus mighty and ab&s;olute, he will certainly bring to pa&s;s, how unlikely, how contrary, how impo&s;&s;ible &s;oever it &s;eem to the eye of man; if he will exalt his de&s;pi&s;ed truth, which always was &s;o to the eye of the great and wi&s;e ones of this world, or give his peo|ple liberty to fear, wor&s;hip and obey him; if he will have truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s have the dominion in men's hearts, and in the nations, and not in the wills and lu&s;ts of men, how great and powerful &s;oever; I &s;ay, if this be his intent, though generation &s;hould ri&s;e up after generation to oppo&s;e him herein, yet will he be too hard for them all, and they will all fall be|fore him; and his truth, his people, his holy eternal coun&s;el, will he rai&s;e up, and cau&s;e to triumph over them all.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="019435_0072_0FABAC91C08FA958">It is man's way to &s;ettle him&s;elf by outward &s;trength again&s;t outward &s;trength, and then he thinks he is &s;afe; not eyeing the invi&s;ible hand which turns the wheels, and delights to overturn that which is out|wardly &s;trong, and &s;eemeth unremoveable, when it forgetteth him, and oppo&s;eth it&s;elf again&s;t him. The Lord God loves to take his enemies at the &s;tronge&s;t, when they are mo&s;t wi&s;e, mo&s;t mighty, even when nothing &s;eems able to deal with them but him&s;elf.

This turned the head again&s;t them which had been for them; and how then could they maintain their &s;tanding?</P>
<P>Oh! that the pre&s;ent generation could &s;ee the tickli&s;hne&s;s of their &s;tanding, and con&s;ider that this is their day of trial, and that the Lord's eye is upon them, to ob&s;erve their ways, to &s;ee whether they will now mind righteou&s;ne&s;s and the liberty of his people, better than formerly they did; and that his truth may in its life and power, and not in &s;uch a form or way of wor&s;hip as they may think good to pre&s;cribe, have its &s;cope in the nation. The Lord's eye and heart are upon his truth and upon his people; and as nations or powers deal with that, &s;o will he deal with them. Oh! therefore be not deceived; for though the Lord hath oftentimes long &s;uffered his people to lie under reproach and per&s;ecution, as he did I&s;rael in Egypt for divers ages, yet at length he hath &s;till heard their groans, and hath ari&s;en to de|liver: And though Pharaoh afterwards with all his &s;trength went after them, and made no que&s;tion but
<PB N="75" REF="019435_0073_0FABAC95AA73F350">
to bring them back again under his &s;ubjection, and there was nothing in appearance able to deliver them from him, yet he could not, but overthrew him&s;elf and his &s;trength utterly. Ye know not what &s;trong cries and tears were put up to the Lord be|fore the&s;e late changes; that righteou&s;ne&s;s might be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the nation, and that his people might have liberty to wor&s;hip him in his fear, and ac|cording to the leadings of his &s;pirit, without being yoked under any form of wor&s;hip which their hearts could not own to be of God.</P>
<P>Let not therefore my true love to the nation, and to the pre&s;ent powers thereof, be de&s;pi&s;ed by them; but let them fear before the mighty God of heaven and earth, and in their hearts bow to him, that they may be humbled, and made fit in&s;tru|ments in his hand for his &s;ervice, and not be found enemies again&s;t him. If they will be fit in&s;truments for God to work by, they mu&s;t be meek, lowly, poor in &s;pirit, waiting in God's fear for his coun&s;el, and not hearken to the fle&s;hly wi&s;dom of man, which is his utter enemy, and will per&s;uade, advi&s;e, and in&s;truct them to &s;ettle the nation and church, as they call it, in a way contrary to him. And re|member this word: Be &s;ure you &s;mite none for obedience to God. Limit not his holy &s;pirit in his people; but limit the unclean and evil &s;pirit in tho&s;e who manife&s;t them&s;elves not to be his people. This is the true intent of government. How can he who governs aright under God, hurt that which is of God, and for God? Or how can he &s;pare that which his &s;word is given him to cut down? Oh! how happy were it for the nation if they would let truth have its &s;cope, and let righteou&s;ne&s;s overcome them! and not contend for &s;hadows again&s;t the &s;ub&s;tance;

<P><HI>Objection.</HI></P>
<P>IT is commonly objected again&s;t us, that we condemn all but our&s;elves; all the churches, martyrs and worthies, formerly, divers of whom &s;ealed their te&s;timony with their blood, and all &s;orts

of Chri&s;tians and profe&s;&s;ors at pre&s;ent, who are not ju&s;t of our &s;tamp and way, though otherwi&s;e ever &s;o zealous.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> The churches, the ble&s;&s;ed martyrs, who &s;uffered for the te&s;timony of a pure con&s;cience towards God, and all the worthies of the Lord in their &s;eve|ral generations, who fought again&s;t the fal&s;e church and &s;pirit, were accepted of God in their te&s;timony again&s;t her, and are not di&s;owned by us, but dearly owned and honored therein; and for agreeing with them in their te&s;timony in &s;everal things. And for te&s;tifying again&s;t the hypocri&s;ies and corruptions of our age, do we &s;uffer in this our day even as they did in their day, from the &s;ame &s;pirit that per&s;ecuted them; which, though it hath much changed its form and way of appearance, yet &s;till retaineth the &s;ame nature.</P>
<P>But all things were not di&s;covered at once. The times were then dark, and the light &s;mall; yet they being faithful according to what was di&s;covered, were precious in the Lord's eyes; and what through ig|norance they erred in, the Lord winked at and over|looked, being plea&s;ed with that &s;incerity and &s;impli|city of heart which he had &s;tirred up in them to|wards him&s;elf. But if they were now alive in the&s;e our days, and &s;hould depart from the &s;incerity which was then in them, and oppo&s;e the light and appearance of the &s;pirit in this age, they would not then be accept|ed of the Lord, but their former &s;incerity would be for|gotten. For the light &s;hineth more and more to|wards the perfect day: And it is not the owning of the light as it &s;hone in the foregoing ages, which will now commend any man to God; but the knowing and &s;ubjecting to the light of the pre&s;ent age. Even as in the&s;e our days that are pa&s;t, there was, &s;ome
<PB N="79" REF="019435_0077_0FABAC99DACE26F0">
years ago, an hone&s;t zeal and true &s;implicity &s;tirring in &s;ome churches, e&s;pecially among the Quakers, which was of the Lord, and was very dear to him; and had the generations of this age abode there, they would have been able to have followed the Lord in every further &s;tep and leading of his &s;pirit&punc; But de|parting from that into &s;ome form or other, the true &s;implicity withered, and another thing began to live in them; and &s;o they &s;ettled upon their lees, mag|nifying the form they had cho&s;e to them&s;elves, till at length their hearts became hardened from the pure fear, even to the contracting of a &s;pirit of prophane|ne&s;s, in&s;omuch as they could mock at the next re|move and di&s;covery of the &s;pirit as &s;ome new light: And &s;o by degrees have grown, and are growing, per&s;ecutors of that &s;pirit in its appearance to the peo|ple of the Lord, which they them&s;elves had once &s;ome ta&s;te of, while they were reproached and per&s;e|cuted for Quakers. And the god of this world, who at fir&s;t tempted them a&s;ide into the form, hath at length prevailed &s;o far to blind them therewith, that they can neither &s;ee what &s;pirit they them&s;elves are of, nor what it is they are endeavouring to per&s;ecute.</P>
<P>Let therefore people con&s;ider the truth of the thing, as it is before the Lord: We do not ca&s;t dirt upon any in whom the truth of God hath &s;tirred and appeared in any mea&s;ure in former ages, or in this our age; but this we te&s;tify again&s;t, viz. the &s;etting up of any form without the life: For it is the erring &s;pirit that &s;till crieth up the form, to keep down the power by the form, and &s;o by the help of it to be|witch from the &s;pirit wherein is the life, and not in the form. This was the painted Jezabel of the apo&s;tles age; fal&s;e teachers finely dre&s;&s;ed up them|&s;elves with the form of godline&s;s, and then under
<PB N="80" REF="019435_0078_0FABAC9B22F48068">
this cover they could deny the power, and make head again&s;t it, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> iii. 5. How ea&s;y is it for them to appear in the forms of doctrines of the go&s;|pel, in the form of zeal, in the form of holine&s;s, to pa&s;s in a nation for the true church; and then to a&s;per&s;e them for heretics, who, appearing in the power, cannot but deny that form which is without the power&punc; This is the great witch of this age, even that &s;pirit of zeal and devotion which is be&s;t cloathed and decked with the form without the power, which though men, who judge of the things of God after the fle&s;h, ju&s;tify, admire, and much contend for, in her &s;everal &s;hapes and dre&s;&s;es, &s;ome being for one, &s;ome for another, yet the Lord is &s;earching after her, and will find her out with his eternal flames, which will make her manife&s;t, and all her lovers &s;hall dread her burning and bed of torment. Now as all along the apo&s;ta&s;y this bewitching &s;pirit, this &s;pirit which bewitcheth from the power, hath crept up under a form of church wor&s;hip and holine&s;s; &s;o the other &s;pirit, the pure &s;pirit of life, the &s;pirit of true zeal and fear of the Lord, hath &s;till appeared more and more out of the forms; who were the be&s;t preachers and mo&s;t eminent Chri&s;tians, of the fir&s;t ri&s;e of the profe&s;&s;ors of this age, were they not tho&s;e who lea&s;t minded the form then, nay, indeed, who were mo&s;t again&s;t the form, and per&s;ecuted, for their con&s;cientious te&s;tifying again&s;t it? And who were the greate&s;t per&s;ecutors then, but they who were the mo&s;t zealous for the form, both of the government and wor&s;hip of the church of England? And where is the per&s;ecuting &s;pirit next to be looked for but in the forms which &s;hould next appear? And where like|wi&s;e is the appearance of the true &s;pirit next to be looked for, but in tho&s;e whom the Lord &s;hould rai&s;e

up to te&s;tify again&s;t tho&s;e forms, and to be the &s;uc|ceeding &s;ufferers for their te&s;timony, as many of the profe&s;&s;ors of this age have been foregoing &s;ufferers for their te&s;timony. Yet if there be any per&s;ons left, among any of the forms which have appeared, whe|ther former or latter, that have not lo&s;t their &s;incerity and true zeal towards God, them we own and have unity with, &s;o far as they keep, or rather are kept, thereto. If there be any among the Epi&s;copal &s;ort that in truth of heart de&s;ire to fear the Lord, and look upon the common prayer-book as an acceptable way of wor&s;hipping him, we pity their blindne&s;s, yet are tender towards them, and would not have the &s;implicity per&s;ecuted in them becau&s;e of this, but rather cheri&s;hed. If there be any among the Pre&s;by|terians, Independents, Anabapti&s;ts, Quakers, or any other &s;ort, that in truth of heart wait upon the Lord in tho&s;e ways, and do not find a deadne&s;s overgrown them, but a pure, fre&s;h, lively zeal towards God, with an unfeigned love to his people, our hearts are one with this; and we cannot fight again&s;t this good thing in any of them, though in love to them we te&s;tify, that their form and way of wor&s;hip is their pre&s;ent lo&s;s and hindrance; yet we doubt not but that the Lord, in his time, will make manife&s;t to &s;uch the light of this age, which is the very thing the people of God, in many foregoing ages, have been praying for. But this is our lamentation, that forms and ways of wor&s;hip abound; but the pure principle, the pure &s;pirit, is lo&s;t and drowned in them all; and that men are hardened again&s;t our te&s;timony, not from the remainders of the &s;implicity in them, but becau&s;e they are erred from the &s;implicity, and fallen in league with another &s;pirit, which hath lain lurking in forms of knowledge and wor&s;hips, to tempt a&s;ide
<PB N="82" REF="019435_0080_0FABAC9D9AE3CA00">
from the &s;implicity, and to hide the &s;ight of the life and power from the panting &s;oul, all this night of the apo&s;ta&s;y.</P>
<P>Now mark how ea&s;y and natural it is to that &s;pirit to enter into a form, to cry up a form, to &s;et up a form in a nation, city, or country; doubtle&s;s it had been done in this nation long ago, had not the mighty hand of the Lord with&s;tood it. When the evil and unclean &s;pirit is detected and driven out of one form, if it doth not &s;uddenly get another to ap|pear in, and tempt with, it mu&s;t needs lo&s;e many of its &s;ubjects. The &s;trumpet, or fal&s;e church, is forced, as God di&s;covers her nakedne&s;s and lewdne&s;s, to change her dre&s;&s;es and appearances, to new trick and adorn her bed; and then, as if &s;he al&s;o were changed, and were now no longer the &s;ame, &s;he comes forth again with boldne&s;s, and tempteth the young man again to come in to her, <HI>Prov.</HI> vii. 16. And thus &s;he ca&s;teth down many wounded; yea, many &s;trong men have been &s;lain by her, ver. 26, who otherwi&s;e would have pondered the path of life, chap. v. vi. had they not been en&s;nared by her flatteries, who for|&s;aketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God, chap. ii. 17. There is no more certain and ready way to &s;uppre&s;s truth, and to betray the hone&s;ty which is &s;ingly &s;earching after it, than to pre&s;ent a form of godline&s;s or wor&s;hip, as the proper way of meeting with it: For hereby the &s;oul is lulled a&s;leep with a fal&s;e hope, until the fre&s;hne&s;s of its de&s;ire begins to die, and its life to wither; and then the fle&s;hly part ea&s;ily grows into unity with, and zeal for, that form which indeed is of the fle&s;h; though it appeared and tempted as if it had been otherwi&s;e. And how many have gone a great way towards hell, and have been deeply entangled and

di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in the chambers of death, by entering into this &s;trumpet's church or hou&s;e, which they then, through the &s;ubtilty of her deceit, took for the hou&s;e or church of God? <HI>Prov.</HI> vii. 27. Con&s;ider the thing a little &s;eriou&s;ly. When the evil &s;pirit is driven out of his &s;trong hold of gro&s;s Popery, whither &s;hould he run but into Epi&s;copacy? When he is driven out of Epi&s;copacy, whither &s;hould he run but into Pre&s;bytery? When he is driven out of Pre&s;bytery, whither &s;hould he run but into Indepen|dency? When he is driven out of Independency, whither &s;hould he run but into Anabapti&s;m? When he is driven out of Anabapti&s;m, whither &s;hould he run but into Quakeri&s;m? And what is his end of running into Epi&s;copacy, but to &s;ave alive that &s;pirit which was hunted of Popery, and could abide no longer there, and &s;o the better, and the &s;afer from being di&s;cerned, to reproach and per&s;ecute the other &s;pirit, wherever it appeared, under the nick-names of the &s;everal &s;orts and &s;ects of profe&s;&s;ors? &amp;c. And what is his end afterwards of running into Pre&s;bte|ry, but to &s;ave that alive which is hunted out of Epi&s;copacy, and to per&s;ecute the former truly zeal|ous &s;pirit, where it &s;hould further appear after|wards, by means of that form? Thus the forms and appearances of things change; but the fight is &s;till the &s;ame, the evil &s;pirit &s;till getting uppermo&s;t, under a form of godline&s;s, and from thence &s;hoot|ing forth its arrows at tho&s;e who &s;eek after purity of heart, and cannot but te&s;tify again&s;t tho&s;e forms where the impure one lodgeth.</P>
<P>This then is the &s;um of our an&s;wer in this re&s;pect; we are not again&s;t the true life and power of godli|ne&s;s, wherever it hath appeared, or yet appears, under the veil of any form what&s;oever. Nay, all

<P>And as concerning tho&s;e &s;ucceeding times, the &s;pirit of the Lord hath &s;ignified, that they will be times of horror and amazement, to all that have and yet do reject his coun&s;el: For as the days of his compa&s;&s;ion, forbearance, warnings, and invitings, have been long, &s;o &s;hall his appearance among&s;t tho&s;e that have with|&s;tood him be fierce and terrible, as who &s;hall abide his coming, for the Lord will work both &s;ecretly and openly, and his arm &s;hall be manife&s;t to his children in both.</P>

<P>And when you &s;ee divi&s;ions, and parties, and rendings in the bowels of nations, and rumours and tempe&s;ts in the minds of the people, then take heed of being moved to this party or to that party, or giving your &s;trength to this or that, or cou&s;elling this or that way, but &s;tand &s;ingle to the truth of God, in which neither war, rent nor divi&s;ion, is; and take heed of that part in any of you, which tru&s;ts and relies upon any &s;ort of the men of this world, in the day of their pro&s;perity; for the &s;ame party will bring you to &s;uffer with them in the time of their adver&s;ity, which will not be long after; for &s;tability in that ground there will be none.
