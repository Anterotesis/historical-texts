<Q><P><HI>And the</HI> LORD <HI>&s;aid unto Mo&s;es, write this for a memorial in a book and rehear&s;e it in the cars of Jo&s;hua; for I will put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.</HI></P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>GOD is known, in a mea&s;ure, to all man|kind, by the judgments which he exe|cuteth in all the earth; and hath direct|ed us to remember that we magnify his work which men behold.</P>
<P>And though we the off-&s;pring of God, and un|der his fatherly direction, cannot by &s;earching find out the ALMIGHTY unto perfection; yet by a careful attention to the works of creation and providence, God's hand in both, is clearly &s;een.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="015279_0004_0F9882C83B77C0">
But our own observation is limited by the short term of human life, and admits only of small im|provements: it is, therefore, by comparing our own imperfect experience, with the information we receive from those who have passed the stage of action before us, that we gain a more compre|hensive view of Divine conduct towards mankind. And succeeding ages may receive additional light in the ways of God, by a faithful testimony of the LORD's doings in our times.</P>
<P>We will not, therefore, hide them from our children, but shew the generations to come, the praises of the Lord&mdash;his strength and the wonder|ful works that he hath done.</P>
<P>This is the special end of our religious assem|bly this day.</P>
<P>And notwithstanding dark intervening clouds, we have yet just cause, cordially to join in that divine Anthem of praise:&mdash;THE LORD REIGNETH, LET THE EARTH REJOICE.</P>
<P>But though the voice of nature and reason is sufficient to render all men inexcusable, who re|main ignorant of Divine superintendence; yet it is by the sacred scriptures, given by inspiration from the Father of lights, that the paths of Divine Providence are more clearly laid open before us, and we are assured, both of the unlimited extent, and rectitude of God's government.</P>
<P>And I think we may safely presume, that the Divine conduct towards the people of Israel, in their various connections, so minutely recorded, is designed to represent the general course of God's
<PB N="7" REF="015279_0005_0F9882C90147F8F0">
Providence, in all ages of the world. For God is the &s;ame, and changeth not.</P>
<P>Unle&s;s we admit this &s;uppo&s;ition, the hi&s;to|rical part of the old te&s;tament mu&s;t appear le&s;s profitable to us for correction and in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s. But if con&s;idered as written prin|cipally with this view, that part of God's holy word may indeed, be a light to our feet and a lamp to our path.</P>
<P>We are here taught in particular, the interpo|&s;ition of Divine Providence, in wars and fightings among men, which proceed immediately from their brutal lu&s;ts; and are a&s;&s;ured that he to whom vengeance belongeth, has not failed, to repay the lo&s;&s;es&mdash;and innocent blood wantonly &s;hed by ag|gre&s;&s;ors, in the&s;e accur&s;ed conflicts. Thus in the in&s;tance before us;</P>
<P>The righteous Judge among the nations, having determined, in his ju&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure, to obliterate the name of the de&s;troyer of his people, enjoined his &s;ervant Mo&s;es, to enter his righteous purpo&s;e upon their records, that it might be tran&s;mitted to all &s;ucceeding generations&mdash;as a terror to evil doers, and &s;upport to the oppre&s;&s;ed: As in our text, which I &s;hall repeat.</P>
<P>"And the Lord &s;aid unto Mo&s;es, write this for a memorial in a book, and rehear&s;e it in the ears of Jo&s;hua, for I will put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.</P>
<P>And Mo&s;es built an altar, and called the name of it JEHOVAH-NISSI.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="015279_0006_0F9882C9BAC4EC00">
For he &s;aid, becau&s;e the Lord hath &s;worn, that the Lord will have war with Amalek, from gene|ration to generation."</P>
<P>Several things are ob&s;ervable in the&s;e words, taken in their connection, which are applicable to the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion: As,</P>
<P>1&s;t. The unju&s;t and cruel attack, made by the A|malekites, upon the camp of I&s;rael.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid v. 8, Then came Amalek, and &s;ought with I&s;rael.</P>
<P>That this war was unju&s;t on the part of Ama|lek, is implied in the puni&s;hment threatned by the Supreme Judge, and is al&s;o evident from the cir|cum&s;tances which attended it.</P>
<P>The I&s;raelites, miraculou&s;ly delivered from Egyptian bondage, were now beginning their march towards the promi&s;ed land&mdash;incumbred with their families&mdash;the infant&mdash;the aged, and in|firm&mdash;their numerous flocks and herds, and &s;ub|&s;tance of every kind; and &s;o mu&s;t be in a condi|tion very unfit for defence, and utterly unprepar|ed for an offen&s;ive war.</P>
<P>This incumbred camp, was expo&s;ed as an ea&s;y prey to an armed force: and it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed that the Amalekites, made this cruel attack with the &s;ordid view of plunder.</P>
<P>From this in&s;atiable lu&s;t of unrighteous gain, wars and fightings&mdash;de&s;truction and blood&s;hed, from the beginning, have ari&s;en, in all ages and
<PB N="9" REF="015279_0007_0F9882CA8127F1B8">
countries, &s;o that from a paradi&s;e, this earth, and particularly our land, is become a field of blood!</P>
<P>Amalek was not of the number of the nations, who&s;e land I&s;rael, by a divine grant, was now go|ing to po&s;&s;e&s;s, which probably they might know, from the public declarations made by God to his people, from the days of Abraham; therefore they could not plead their own future &s;ecurity in ju&s;tification of this horrid act of violence.</P>
<P>If we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, this rapacious band was invited&mdash;urged, and even conducted, by &s;ome abandoned I&s;raelites, who expected to be &s;harers in the plunder of their brethren: Ala&s;s! the &s;up|po&s;ition may be ju&s;tified, by too many flagrant in&s;tances in our times, and even at <HI>this day.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tell it not in Gath!</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>But however this was, we are a&s;&s;ured, the war on the part of the aggre&s;&s;ors, was unju&s;t and a dar|ing affront offered to the God of the armies of I&s;rael, under who&s;e immediate banner, they were peaceably marching to their promi&s;ed re&s;t.</P>
<P>And it appears that this daring violence was attended with da&s;tardly cruelty and &s;avage bar|barity: Their attack was not with martial brave|ry, in face of day; but made by a &s;kulking am|bu&s;cade, and upon that part of the camp lea&s;t ca|pable of defence.</P>
<P>Thus it is &s;aid, Deut. xxv, 17, "Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way when ye were come forth out of Egypt, how he met thee by the way, and &s;mote the hindermo&s;t of thee, even all
<PB N="10" REF="015279_0008_0F9882CB3A996F30">
that were feeble behind thee, when thou wa&s;t faint and weary, and feared not God."</P>
<P>It is not of importance, that we know the ori|gin of this accur&s;ed people, who&s;e latter end, has long &s;ince peri&s;hed, from the earth.</P>
<P>The &s;acred hi&s;tory leads us to &s;uppo&s;e them to be a branch of the family of E&s;au, which was &s;e|parated from the &s;tock of the Edomites, and form|ed into a di&s;tinct &s;tate, or rather band of robbers, under duke Amalek mentioned Gen. xxxvi. 16. Amalek is there &s;aid v. 12, to be the &s;on of the concubine of Eliphaz, who was E&s;an's &s;on; and from him probably, this devoted people derived their name.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See al&s;o I Chron. i. 36.</NOTE> But however this may be, their name only remains, as a monument of God's ju&s;t indignation again&s;t the people who delight in war.</P>
<P>Which leads us to ob&s;erve from the words,</P>
<P>IIdly. The manife&s;t tokens of God's righteous di&s;plea&s;ure, again&s;t the Amalekites, for their vio|lence offered to I&s;rael.</P>
<P>"The righteous Lord loveth righteou&s;ne&s;s," and his &s;oul "abhorreth the bloody and deceitful man." "Vengeance is mine, I will repay &s;aith the Lord."</P>
<P>This was, in part, immediately executed, by the hand of Jo&s;hua, and the cho&s;en bands of I&s;rael, who it is &s;aid, "di&s;comfited Amalek with the edge of the &s;word." Yet a day of full recompence is here threatned, when God will pour out his wrath upon them to the uttermo&s;t, and blot out the re|membrance of Amalek from under Heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="015279_0009_0F9882CCAE0FABF8">
And we may here join with the Angel of the waters, Rev. xvi. 5, and &s;ay, "Thou art righte|ous O Lord&mdash;becau&s;e Thou ha&s;t judged thus. For they have &s;hed the blood of thy &s;ervants and thou ha&s;t given them blood to drink, for they are worthy."</P>
<P>For though God, who at one view comprehends all events, over-rules the &s;inful actions of intelli|gent beings, &s;o as to accompli&s;h the wi&s;e purpo&s;es of his providence and grace; yet this doth not, in any degree, extenuate their guilt, nor free the &s;in|ner from threatned puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>God, the &s;upreme ruler, &s;trictly requires obedi|ence to his laws, which are all like their Divine Author, holy, ju&s;t, wi&s;e and good.</P>
<P>Sin is a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the law of God; and as, contrary to his nature and will, He mu&s;t behold all &s;in and &s;inners, in that character, with the great|e&s;t abhorrence. And God in no other &s;en&s;e can be &s;aid to permit &s;in, but this only; that he doth not by his power, interpo&s;e, to re&s;train the &s;inner from the commi&s;&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>Can it then, from this, be ju&s;tly inferred? or will any weak arrogant mortal pre&s;ume to a&s;&s;ert, that a being of infinite purity, is the author or efficient cau&s;e of the &s;ins, and even murders, men commit?&mdash;GOD FORBID!&mdash;</P>
<P>God, the common Father of mankind, parti|cularly, from the beginning, guarded the lives of men, by an expre&s;s law, enforced with this awful &s;anction&mdash;"Who&s;o &s;heddeth man's blood, by man &s;hall his blood be &s;hed."&mdash;And to &s;trike the greater
<PB N="12" REF="015279_0010_0F9882CCC02C9610">
awe; it is added, "for in the image of God made he him."</P>
<P>God thus, in the plaine&s;t manner, expre&s;&s;es his utter abhorrence of the unnatural crime of murder in every in&s;tance. War, on the part of aggre&s;|&s;ors, is a bold attempt to murder with peculiar aggravations. "Every battle of the warrior is with confu&s;ed noi&s;e and garments rolled in blood."&mdash;Here men are often murdered by thou&s;ands, with|out di&s;tinction of character&mdash;age&mdash;or &s;ex.</P>
<P>Shall not a righteous God, and tender Father vi&s;it for the&s;e things, &s;hall not his &s;oul be avenged on &s;uch a nation at this?</P>
<P>And God to whom vengeance belongeth, hath in this ca&s;e, entru&s;ted man, in part, with the exe|cution of it.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e words:&mdash;"Who&s;o &s;heddeth man's blood, by man &s;hall his blood be &s;hed", are not to be con|&s;idered as a bare permi&s;&s;ion, but a po&s;itive com|mand, obliging all to endeavour to cut off tho&s;e inhuman mon&s;ters from the earth.</P>
<P>This renders it evident, that a defen&s;ive war is not only lawful, but &s;pecially enjoined by the Lord of Ho&s;ts, when other means fail to pro|cure &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>It is then according to the prayer of Solomon, 2 Chron. vi. 34. That a people go out to war again&s;t their enemies, by the way that God will &s;end them: with a view to execute the divine law, in cutting off men of blood. And where the laws of civil &s;ociety do not extend, the &s;word of
<PB N="13" REF="015279_0011_0F9882CD8026F0C0">
ju&s;tice, in the hands of men, in every other way, is borne in vain.</P>
<P>And thus Mo&s;es, in the in&s;tance before us, di|rected Jo&s;hua, to "choo&s;e out men, and go fight with Amalek." And in like in&s;tances, a cur&s;e is denounced again&s;t the man that withholdeth his hand from &s;hedding blood&mdash;and even on him that doth this work of the Lord negligently. This indeed, is not to be done, in any in&s;tance, merely from a &s;pirit of revenge, but as acting under a divine warrant, to take away the life forfeited into the hands of God.</P>
<P>Shocking thought!&mdash;That &s;o many of the hu|man race, who are all of one blood, and amply provided for by their common parent, &s;hould thus, from pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;pride&mdash;lu&s;t of gain&mdash;and lawle&s;s dominion&mdash;render them&s;elves a cur&s;e to the world, and be accur&s;ed of God and man.</P>
<P>And though few comparatively, in any age, among the mo&s;t uncultivated of mankind, have &s;o far lo&s;t all feelings of humanity, as openly to ju&s;tify private murders; yet frequent in|&s;tances are not wanting, among collective bodies, or nations profe&s;&s;ing civility, and even chri&s;tianity, who glory in public &s;laughters; and arrogantly boa&s;t of their power, to trample under feet the lives and liberties of their fellow mortals, and wantonly &s;port in their de&s;truction.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Burgoyne's letter to Tom:&mdash;on the de&s;truction of Charle&s;town.</NOTE></P>
<P>But though hand join in hand, yet &s;uch re|mor&s;ele&s;s workers of iniquity &s;hall not always go unpuni&s;hed. He that is higher than the highe&s;t
<PB N="14" REF="015279_0012_0F9882CE3B830BE0">
of men regardeth. The Lord is a man of war, the Lord is his name. He breaketh the bows of the mighty men; and they who are girded with &s;trength &s;tumble and fall. As he did Amalek, the God of armies will &s;catter the people that delight in war.</P>
<P>IIIdly, We may here ob&s;erve; that Mo&s;es a&s;cribes to God the glory of their pre&s;ent deliver|ance, and confides in the divine promi&s;e of fully avenging their wrongs, perpetrated by cruel op|pre&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>It is here &s;aid, "Mo&s;es built an altar and called the name of it JEHOVAH-NISSI, (i. e. the Lord my banner.) For he &s;aid, becau&s;e the Lord hath &s;worn, that the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation."</P>
<P>Salvation is of the Lord, and whoever are the in&s;truments of our &s;afety, we mu&s;t religiou&s;ly a&s;cribe the glory and victory to the Lord of Ho&s;ts, the &s;hield of our defence, and great deliverer.</P>
<P>Mo&s;es had now nothing more to fear from this in&s;idious foe, &s;ince the God of armies, had e&s;pou&s;|ed their cau&s;e: and though the great &s;hepherd of I&s;rael deferred the final execution of his wrath again&s;t their enemies, for many generations; yet through faith in the promi&s;e, this man of God, could devoutly &s;acrifice on his altar of prai&s;e, as &s;eeing him who is invi&s;ible.&mdash;If God be for us, who can be again&s;t us?</P>
<P>In his di&s;pen&s;ations toward public &s;ocieties, e&s;pecially, as in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance&mdash;God is &s;aid to vi&s;it the iniquity of the fathers upon the chil|dren,
<PB N="15" REF="015279_0013_0F9882CEFA894A60">
in &s;ucceeding generations: but this infers no impeachment of divine ju&s;tice, or veracity: as this extends to tho&s;e children only, who tread in the wicked &s;teps of their forefathers, and &s;o ap|prove their evil deeds, and become partners in their guilt. Of this character was the generation of the Jews in our Saviours day, of whom he &s;ays, by their own cruel murders, they ju&s;tly brought upon them&s;elves the guilt and puni&s;hment of all the innocent blood, &s;hed by their forefathers.</P>
<P>And thus frequent mention is made, in the &s;a|cred hi&s;tory, of Amalek, in following ages, as confederate with other nations, in their wars again&s;t I&s;rael, which is an evidence, that at the time of the utter de&s;truction of that people, they peri&s;hed, in their own per&s;onal guilt, and not pro|perly for their fathers crimes.</P>
<P>IVthly and La&s;tly, We may ob&s;erve in the words, the direction given by God to Mo&s;es, to perpe|tuate the remembrance of the&s;e things.</P>
<P>"And the Lord &s;aid unto Mo&s;es, write this for a memorial in a book, and rehear&s;e it in the ears of Jo&s;hua."</P>
<P>Jo&s;hua in particular as Captain of the ho&s;t, and even the whole congregation were fully acquaint|ed with this tragical event, it was even impre&s;&s;ed on their hearts, in characters of blood!</P>
<P>But God requires his wonderful works, both of mercy and judgment, to be &s;ought out, kept in mind, and faithfully tran&s;mitted to &s;ucceeding generations.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="015279_0014_0F9882CFBB544B20">
Impre&s;&s;ions made by the mo&s;t &s;triking events are impaired by time, unle&s;s renewed by repeated reflection: And faithful records, are the only &s;ure conveyance of pa&s;t events to po&s;terity: hereby the dealings of God with the fathers, are made known to their de&s;cendants, after they have been for ages &s;ilent in the du&s;t.</P>
<P>Mo&s;es therefore, by divine command publi&s;hed the events of that important day for a memorial, both to the pre&s;ent and after generations&mdash;Not merely as hi&s;torical facts, or for amu&s;ement, but to promote practical godline&s;s; in the following in&s;tances.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, This memorial would forever tend to excite the prai&s;e of that people to God for his mercy to them, in that day of di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>God &s;uffered a cruel enemy, unawares to invade the camp of I&s;rael, thus unprepared for defence; but yet with an eye of tenderne&s;s, beheld their helple&s;s &s;tate&mdash;and animated, and &s;ucceeded his people, in repelling the violence of their foes; and though &s;ome fell victims to their rage, he cau&s;ed the remainder of their wrath to prai&s;e his great NAME.</P>
<P>And this deliverance is included in that &s;ong of prai&s;e, uttered many ages following. See P&s;al. cxxiv. "if it had not been the Lord who was on our &s;ide may I&s;rael now &s;ay&mdash;When men ro&s;e up again&s;t us, then had they &s;wallowed us up quick&mdash;when their wrath was kindled again&s;t us&mdash;then the proud waves had gone over our &s;oul&mdash;Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, who hath not given us a prey to their teeth."</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="015279_0015_0F9882D07B5C78E0">
Secondly, Again, the memory of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of that day would tend, in all ages, to the humi|liation of this God's covenant people.</P>
<P>Public calamities, though brought upon a peo|ple by the hands of wicked and unrea&s;onable men, may always be con&s;idered, as divine correcti|ons for prevailing &s;ins.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, v. 3, "the people murmured":&mdash;Then came Amalek and fought with I&s;rael."</P>
<P>I&s;rael was now called by God, to take up arms again&s;t violent men; and, at the &s;ame time, by this awakening providence, manife&s;tly called to deep humiliation for their vile ingratitude, in murmuring again&s;t Mo&s;es, and in effect again&s;t God.</P>
<P>And the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;&s;ive civil &s;ociety, when they read their fathers public di&s;tre&s;&s;es, might be a&s;&s;ured, that their ways were di&s;plea&s;ing to God; and thereby receive in&s;truction, to walk more circumy &s;pectly and humbly before the Lord.</P>
<P>And in this &s;en&s;e we may con&s;i&s;tently under|&s;tand the confe&s;&s;ions of this people, frequently made before God, not only of their own &s;ins, but al&s;o of the &s;ins of their fathers. See P&s;al. cvi.&mdash;"We have &s;inned with our fathers, we have com|mitted iniquity&mdash;Our fathers under&s;tood not thy wonders in Egypt, they remembered not the mul|titude of thy mercies"&mdash;"They &s;ang his prai&s;e, they &s;oon forgat his works, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Thirdly, This written memorial, was de&s;igned for an evidence, when the de&s;truction of the Amale|kites &s;hould be fully executed, that it was from
<PB N="18" REF="015279_0016_0F9882D13ABE96E8">
God, and a ju&s;t puni&s;hment, for the part they had acted in this cruel war.</P>
<P>God, for wi&s;e rea&s;ons, was plea&s;ed to defer the final execution of this terrible threatning for near|ly the &s;pace of four hundred years; and then to employ his injured people in the ezecution of it. And they might otherwi&s;e have been induced to a&s;cribe the victory to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But Got, by this record, gave full information, to all &s;ueceeding ages, that the war was his&mdash;That in the de&s;truction of Amalek, he was making in|qui&s;ition for blood, and that his right hand and Holy arm gave the victory.</P>
<P>Though the long-&s;uffering of God, is often &s;hewn towards men of blood: yet he never for|gets their cruelty to his people. For "thus &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts," 1 Sam. xv, 2. "I remember that which Amalek did to I&s;rael, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt."</P>
<P>Fourthly, The memorial of this event, would teach individuals the vanity of all earthly pro&s;pects.&mdash;</P>
<P>As a people, the children of I&s;rael had a never failing promi&s;e of the land of Canaan, and each one had rai&s;ed expectations of being, in a &s;hort time, fixed in the full and quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their portion of it.</P>
<P>But ala&s;s! a number were here, by the hand of violence, &s;uddenly cut off in their pa&s;&s;age, and their expectation peri&s;hed from the earth.</P>
<P>And thus have we, with the mo&s;t tender &s;ym|pathy, in the cour&s;e of this baleful war, &s;een the
<PB N="19" REF="015279_0017_0F9882D2013E67B8">
ri&s;ing hopes of particular per&s;ons and families, in this place, and through the land, in a moment de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>Fifthly. Once more, This memorial, would na|turally lead this people, in all future conflicts, to repo&s;e their tru&s;t in the God of the armies of I&s;rael. Pa&s;t experience of divine aid, gives energy to faith and prayer and fortitude in the day of battle: For God is the &s;ame, and his mercy en|dureth forever.</P>
<P>And this &s;evere threatning, confirmed "by an oath, that the Lord, will have war with Amalek from gene|ration to generation" manife&s;ts God's utter abhor|rence of all offen&s;ive wars; and al&s;o implies, a gene|ral promi&s;e to I&s;rael, and every like injured people, throughout all ages, of &s;uccour and defence.</P>
<P>So that we in this land, with I&s;rael of old, have a divine warrant to &s;ay,&mdash;"Rejoice O ye nations with his people, for the Lord will avenge the blood of his people, and will render recompence to his adver&s;aries, and will be merciful to his land; and to his people." Dent. xxxii, 43.</P>
<P>Here let us make a &s;hort pau&s;e:&mdash;And may all the people &s;ay AMEN!</P>
<P>And now brethren of the &s;tock of New-Eng|land; what has been &s;ugge&s;ted from the divine oracles, directs our attention to the occa&s;ion of this anniver&s;ary: which is for a memorial of the tra|gical commencement of the pre&s;ent unju&s;t and unnatural war: and particularly the innocent blood cruelly &s;hed at the doors of this hou&s;e&mdash;And the con&s;equent murders, and ravages perpe|trated

<P>The pre&s;ent generation, in this town and neigh|bourhood, need no information, of what their weeping eyes then &s;aw&mdash;their cars heard&mdash;and their pierced heart endured, on that never to be forgotten day&mdash;The horrid &s;cene, is in&s;tamped upon all our brea&s;ts, in <HI>characters of blood!</HI></P>

<P>But though God in his holy providence, has not, to this time, &s;een fit to &s;till the enemy and the

<P>We gratefully on this day of remembrance, with Mo&s;es of old, bow before the altar of our God, and offer the &s;acrifice of prai&s;e to <HI>Jehovah-Ni&s;&s;i,</HI> the Lord our banner, who was a pre&s;ent help in that day of trouble.</P>
<P>To accompli&s;h their unju&s;t and cruel purpo&s;es, the treacherous foe, like evening wolves greedy of prey, and hungry ions from their dens, crept out of Bo&s;ton<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">While the town, on the land &s;ide, was open, and the troops &s;upplied with fre&s;h provi&s;ions from the country.</NOTE> through a by-way, in the dark and &s;ilent night, that un&s;een and unawares, they might lay wa&s;te and de&s;troy.</P>
<P>But the Almighty Keeper of I&s;rael, who never &s;lumbereth, to their &s;urprize, brought their hid|den coun&s;els &s;o far to light, that a few of our brave militia, from adjoining towns, had time to collect, and by God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, turned the enemy's boa&s;ted victory, into a &s;hameful flight.</P>
<P>Not unto us O Lord&mdash;not unto us, but to thy glorious name be all the prai&s;e.</P>
<P>And a review of this calamitous war, from that woful day to the pre&s;ent, through two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive revolving years, affords us much occa&s;ion to &s;ing of mercy, as well as judgment before the Lord.</P>

But the re&s;toration of monarchy, 1660, opened the flood gates to every vice &s;upported by royal ex|ample and arbitrary power: our charter &s;oon fell a &s;acrifice to de&s;potic will; and our fathers, then &s;aw their rights trampled upon by an <HI>Andros,</HI> as we have &s;een ours of late by a <HI>Gage</HI> and an <HI>Howe.</HI></P>
<P>There was indeed, at that day, in the Briti&s;h nation, virtue &s;ufficient, to dethrone the tyrant: glorious indeed, might the revolution have been, if the root of tyranny had peri&s;hed with that corrupt branch.</P>

<P>The revolution gave pre&s;ent redre&s;s, but the principles of it were never carried into full effect, in Britain; and our liberties, from that period, by patents, greatly abridged.</P>
<P>The charter, we received from King William, brought, in the face of it, &s;ome appearance of liber|ty and &s;afety&mdash;But in its con&s;titution, were the &s;eeds of de&s;truction.</P>
<P>The chief magi&s;trate, was not of our own choice, but his appointment and continuance in office depended upon the royal plea&s;ure, and his admini&s;trations, in effect, upon &s;ecret and arbitrary In&s;tructions.</P>
<P>His negative upon our choice of coun&s;ellors; and all acts of a&s;&s;embly: his power a&s;&s;umed, to

<P>A governor, thus detached from the commu|nity, over which he is commi&s;&s;ioned to pre&s;ide, and dependent upon the crown, or rather a venal officer of &s;tate, for his political exi&s;tence; in&s;tead of being a father to the people, is laid under &s;trange temptations, for &s;elf-&s;ecurity, to act the part of a vile informer. And experience of late has wofully taught us, that our own coun|try-men, in this commi&s;&s;ion, have been the mo&s;t active by every ba&s;e in&s;inuation, to effect our de&s;truction.</P>
<P>In addition to this oppre&s;&s;ive power, given to his &s;ub&s;titute, the Briti&s;h King challenged a right, within a limited time, at his plea&s;ure, to vacate all laws pa&s;&s;ed by our A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>And the parliament a&s;&s;umed a lawle&s;s power, <HI>&s;olely</HI> to confine and regulate our trade and manu|factures at their will.</P>
<P>To the&s;e growing oppre&s;&s;ions, our fathers and we have, for near a century pa&s;t, &s;ubmitted with|out re&s;i&s;tance, though not without complaints in a great mea&s;ure ineffectual: &s;till hoping, that though equity failed, common intere&s;t might operate for our relief.</P>

<P>And as if, with the a&s;piring man of &s;in, they thought them&s;elves exalted to the throne of the Mo&s;t High; the parliament ordain, that they have a right, to make laws, binding on America, in <HI>all ca&s;es what&s;oever.</HI></P>
<P>This is a right, which no created being can ju&s;t|ly challenge, it belongs only to God omnipotent: and it would be the highe&s;t trea&s;on, and rebellion again&s;t him who is King of kings, for us tamely to &s;ubmit to this unju&s;t and impious claim of Britons, worms of the du&s;t, like our&s;elves.</P>
<P>Surely our voluntary conce&s;&s;ion, to this unwar|rantable demand, would be a practical declaration of our readine&s;s, to go and &s;erve other gods. Fal&s;e deities, which our fathers groaned under; but refu&s;ed to &s;erve, on the other &s;ide of the flood.</P>
<P>To avert the impending &s;torm, we rea&s;oned&mdash;remon&s;trated&mdash;and entreated: but were rejected, with &s;upercilious di&s;dain. Conque&s;t evidently appeared to be their bloody de&s;ign, and full expectation.</P>
<P>To accompli&s;h this, an armed force was &s;ent here, to trample us, our rights, laws, and religion, under their feet. But that the promoters of this de|te&s;table war, (a war, which might excite the feel|ings of a &s;avage) might have a colourable pretence
<PB N="26" REF="015279_0024_0F9882D73AA4DCF8">
for engaging in it: their licentious troops were quartered in our capital: that by continual in&s;ults they might provoke the multitude to make re|&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>But our vain hopes of an accommodation, upon equitable terms, and abhorrence of human &s;laugh|ter, re&s;trained us, under manifold provocations, from taking up arms, until the innocent blood of our friends &s;hed in this place&mdash;their dying ago|nies&mdash;the groans of the wounded&mdash;the heart pierc|ing di&s;tre&s; of the bereaved&mdash;and a full &s;en&s;e of our common danger, awakened the&s;e &s;tates unitedly to &s;tand up for their lives, again&s;t a declared in|veterate enemy.</P>
<P>And now, I think, it mu&s;t evidently appear, to every per&s;on, who is not blinded by &s;ordid inter|e&s;t, or under &s;ome fatal prejudice, that the war, on our part, is ju&s;t; and that we have been called of God, to take up arms, in our nece&s;&s;ary defence, and to &s;eperate from Britain FOREVER.</P>
<P>And here, brethren, we may &s;afely re&s;t our cau&s;e&mdash;the cau&s;e of our much injured and di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed country: for the righteous Lord loveth righteou&s;ne&s;s, and will, in his time, bring forth judgment unto victory.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations, will be our ample &s;upport under the heavy burdens of this di&s;tre&s;&s;ing war&mdash;relieve us under private lo&s;&s;es&mdash;and be an abun|dant con&s;olation to parents and friends, mourning for their children and relatives, who have fallen in battle&mdash;or peri&s;hed in<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cruelty, never practiced by the Savages of America!</NOTE> cruel captivity.</P>

<P>And now as a clo&s;e&mdash;While we trace the vari|ous effects of this unju&s;t and de&s;tructive war; let us reflect, that our real danger doth not origi|nate from the uncea&s;ing rage of Britain, or their rapacious mercenary allies; nor from the conti|nued traiterous de&s;igns of fal&s;e brethren among our&s;elves: but from the ju&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure of our God and Father again&s;t us, for our manifold of|fences, again&s;t his law and go&s;pel.</P>
<P>For though we dare not con&s;ider an infinitely ju&s;t and holy God, as agent, in this unju&s;t war; yet he &s;uffers it as the rod of his correction. for our &s;ins. But is waiting that he may be gracious.</P>

Let us all be humbled under his mighty hand, that he may exalt us in due time.</P>
<P>We are all forward to complain of need of a general reformation; but this will have no good effect; till from &s;elf conviction, we are brought, each one, to &s;mite upon his brea&s;t, and &s;ay, what have I done? and put away the violence, which is in our own hands.</P>
<P>God has never ca&s;t off a people utterly, till their apo&s;tacy hath been nearly univer&s;al, and they; unreclaimable, by the ordinary methods of divine providence and grace.&mdash;God for the &s;ake of ten righteous per&s;ons, would have &s;pared the con&s;ederate cities of Sodom.</P>

<P>Our civil rulers, now dependent only on God and the people; we tru&s;t, will improve their ex|ten&s;ive authority and example, as a terror to evil doers, and a prai&s;e to them that do well.</P>

<P>The call of Providence, brethren, is particular to us of this town and neighbourhood, where the furious flames of war fir&s;t brake forth, and raged with unrelenting de&s;truction.</P>
<P>We have the wormwood and gall deep in re|membrance: let our &s;oul be humbled within us.
