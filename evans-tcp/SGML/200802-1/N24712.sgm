<P>AS there is a &s;ad mirth, &s;o there is a joyful mourning: look upon the voluptuous man, however laughter may appear in his face, yet &s;adne&s;s ever centers in the heart; his carnal delights are not only in vain, but vexing; like mu&s;ic, they play him into a melancholy fit: whil&s;t the banquet la&s;ts, the &s;en&s;uali&s;t &s;ings: but when the reckoning comes, his &s;pirit &s;inks, his burning candle pre&s;ently goes out in a &s;tink|ing &s;nuff, his &s;hining &s;un in&s;tantly &s;ets in the watry cloud.

<HEAD>THE VISION OF MIRZA.</HEAD>
<P>ON the fifth day of the moon, which, ac|cording to the cu&s;tom of my forefathers, I al|ways keep holy, after having wa&s;hed my&s;elf, and offered up my morning devotions, I a&s;|cended
<PB N="57" REF="032741_0057_0FF4D43AB5AD4988">
the high hills of Bagdat, in order to pa&s;s the re&s;t of the day in meditation and pray|er. As I was here airing my&s;elf on the tops of the mountains, I fell into a profound con|templation on the vanity of human life; and pa&s;&s;ing from one thought to another, &s;urely, &s;aid I, man is but a &s;hadow, and life a dream. Whil&s;t I was thus amu&s;ing, I ca&s;t my eyes to|wards the &s;ummit of a rock that was not far from me, where I di&s;covered one in the habit of a &s;hepherd, with a little mu&s;ical in&s;trument in his hand. As I looked upon him, he appli|ed it to his lips, and began to play upon it. The &s;ound of it was exceeding &s;weet, and wrought into a variety of tunes that were inexpre&s;&s;ibly melodious, and altogether different from any thing I had ever heard: they put me in mind of tho&s;e heavenly airs that are played to the de|parted &s;ouls of good men upon their fir&s;t arri|val in Paradi&s;e, to wear out the impre&s;&s;ions of the la&s;t agonies, and qualify them for the plea&s;|ures of that happy place. My heart melted away in &s;ecret raptures.</P>
<P>I had often been told that the rock before me was the haunt of a genius; and that &s;ever|al had been entertained with that mu&s;ic, who had pa&s;&s;ed by it, but never heard that the mu|&s;ician had before made him&s;elf vi&s;ible. When he had rai&s;ed my thoughts by tho&s;e tran&s;port|ing airs which he played, to ta&s;te the plea&s;ures of his conver&s;ation, as I looked upon him, like one a&s;toni&s;hed, he beckoned to me and by the
<PB N="58" REF="032741_0058_0FF50A9288766990">
waving of his hand directed me to approach the place where he &s;at. I drew near with that reverence which is due to a &s;uperior natures, and as my heart was entirely &s;ubdued by the captivating &s;trains I had heard, I fell down at his feet and wept. The genius &s;miled upon me with a look of compa&s;&s;ion and affability that familiarized him to my imagination, and at once di&s;pelled all the fears and apprehen&s;ions with which I approached him. He lifted me from the ground, and taking me by the hand, "Mirza," &s;aid he, "I have heard thee in thy &s;oliloques: follow me:"</P>
<P>He then led me to the highe&s;t pinnacle of the rock, and placing me on the top of it, "Ca&s;t thy eyes ea&s;tward," &s;aid he, "and tell me what thou fee&s;t." "I &s;ee," &s;aid I, "a huge valley, and prodigious tide of water rolling through it." The valley thou &s;ee&s;t, &s;aid he, is the vale of mi&s;ery, and the tide of water that thou &s;ee&s;t is part of the great tide of eternity. What is the rea&s;on, &s;aid I, that the tide I &s;ee ri&s;es out of a thick mi&s;t at one end, and again lo&s;es it&s;elf in a thick mi&s;t at the other? What thou &s;ee&s;t, &s;aid he, is that portion of eternity which is called time mea&s;ured out by the &s;un, and reach|ing from the begining of the world to its con|&s;ummation. Examine now, &s;aid he, this &s;ea that is bounded with darkne&s;s at both ends, and tell me what thou di&s;covere&s;t in it? I &s;ee a bridge, &s;aid I, &s;tanding in the mid&s;t of the tide. The bridge thou &s;ee&s;t, &s;aid he, is human life;
<PB N="59" REF="032741_0059_0FF50AA2A9CB3030">
con&s;ider it attentively. Upon a more lei&s;urely &s;urvey of it, I found that it con&s;i&s;ted of three|&s;core and ten entire arches, with &s;everal bro|ken arches, which, added to tho&s;e that were entire, made up the number about an hundred. As I was counting the arches, the genius told me that the bridge con&s;i&s;ted at fir&s;t of a thou|&s;and arches; but that a great flood &s;wept away the re&s;t, and left the bridge in the ruinous condition I now behold it; but tell me further, &s;aid he, what thou di&s;covere&s;t on it? I &s;ee mul|titudes of people pa&s;&s;ing over it, &s;aid I, and a black cloud hanging on each end of it. As I looked more attentively, I &s;aw &s;everal of the pa&s;&s;engers dropping through the bridge, into the great tide that flowed underneath it; and I &s;aw innumerable trap-doors that lay conceal|ed in the bridge, which the pa&s;&s;engers no &s;ooner trod upon but they fell through them into the tide, and immediately di&s;appeared. The&s;e hid|en pit-falls were &s;et very thick at the entrance of the bridge, &s;o that throngs of people no &s;ooner broke through the cloud than many of them fell into them. They grew thinner to|wards the middle, but multiplied and lay clo&s;er together towards the end of the arches that were entire.</P>
<P>There were indeed &s;ome per&s;ons, but their number was very &s;mall, that continued a kind of hobbling march on the broken arches, but fell through one after another, being quite tir|ed and &s;pent with &s;o long a walk.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="032741_0060_0FF50AB5B2121998">
I pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time in the contemplation of this wonderful &s;tructure, and the great variety of objects which it pre&s;ented. My heart was filled with a deep melancholy to &s;ee &s;everal dropping unexpectedly in the mid&s;t of mirth and jollity, and catching at every thing that &s;tood by them to &s;ave them&s;elves. Some were looking up towards the heavens in a thoughtful po&s;ture, and in the mid&s;t of a &s;up|plication &s;tumbled and fell out of &s;ight. Multi|tudes were very bu&s;y in the pur&s;uit of bubbles that glittered in their eyes and danced before them; but often when they thought them|&s;elves within the reach of them, their footing failed, and down they &s;unk. In this confu|&s;ion of objects, I ob&s;erved &s;ome with &s;cimitars in their hands, and others with urinals, who ran to and fro upon the bridge, thru&s;ting &s;ev|eral per&s;ons on trap-doors which did not &s;eem to lie in their way, and which they might have e&s;caped, had they not been thus forced upon them.</P>
<P>The genius &s;eeing me indulge my&s;elf in this melancholy pro&s;pect, told me I had dwelt long enough upon it; Take thine eyes off the bridge, &s;aid he, and tell me if thou &s;ee&s;t any thing thou do&s;t not comprehend. Upon looking up, What mean, &s;aid I, tho&s;e great flights of birds that are perpetually hovering about the bridge, and &s;ettling upon it from time to time? I &s;ee vultures, harpies, ravens, cormorants, and among many other feathered creatures &s;everal

little winged boys, that pearch in great num|bers upon the middle arches. The&s;e, &s;aid the genius, are envy, avarice, &s;uper&s;tition de&s;pair, love, with the like cares and pa&s;&s;ions that infe&s;t human life.</P>
<P>I here fetched a deep &s;igh; Alas! &s;aid I, man was made in vain! <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ow is he given away to mi&s;ery and mortality! tortured in life, and &s;wallowed up in death! The genius being moved with compa&s;&s;ion towards me, bid me quit &s;o uncomfortable a pro&s;pect. Look no more, &s;aid he, on man in the fir&s;t &s;tage of his exi&s;tence, in his &s;etting out for eternity? but ca&s;t thine eye on that thick mi&s;t into which the tide bears the &s;everal generations of mortals that fall into it. I directed my &s;ight as I was ordered, and (whether or no the good genius &s;trengthened it with any &s;upernatural force, or di&s;&s;ipated part of the mi&s;t that was before too thick for the eye to penetrate) I &s;aw the valley opening at the farther end, and &s;pread|ing forth into an immen&s;e ocean, that had a huge rock of adamant running through the mid&s;t of it, and dividing it into two equal parts. The clouds &s;till re&s;ted on one half thereof, in|&s;omuch that I could di&s;cover nothing in it: but the other appeared to me a va&s;t ocean planted with innumerable i&s;lands, that were covered with fruits and flowers, and interwo|ven with a thou&s;and little &s;hining &s;eas that ran among them. I could &s;ee per&s;ons dre&s;&s;ed in glorious habits with garlands upon their heads,
<PB N="62" REF="032741_0062_0FF50AD3B083A5B0">
pa&s;&s;ing among the trees, lying down by the &s;ides of fountains, or re&s;ting on beds of flow|ers; and could hear a confu&s;ed harmony of &s;inging birds, falling waters, human voices and mu&s;ical in&s;truments. Gladne&s;s grew in me upon the di&s;covery of &s;o delightful a &s;cene. I wi&s;hed for the wings of an eagle that I might fly away to tho&s;e happy &s;eats; but the genius told me there was no pa&s;&s;age to them, except through the gates of death that I &s;aw opening every moment upon the bridge. The i&s;lands, &s;aid he, that lie &s;o fre&s;h and green before thee, and with which the whole of the ocean ap|pears &s;potted as far as thou can&s;t &s;ee, are more in number than the &s;and on the &s;ea-&s;hore; there are myriads of i&s;lands behind tho&s;e which thou here di&s;covere&s;t, reaching further than thine eye, or even thine imagination can ex|tend it&s;elf. The&s;e are the man&s;ions of good men after death, who according to the degree and kinds of virtue in which they excelled, are di&s;tributed among the&s;e &s;everal i&s;lands, which abound with plea&s;ure of different kinds and degrees, &s;uitable to the reli&s;hes and per|fections of tho&s;e who are &s;ettled in them; ev|ery i&s;land is a paradi&s;e accommodated to its re&s;pective inhabitants. Are not the&s;e, O Mir|za, habitations worth contending for; Does life appear mi&s;erable, that gives thee opportu|nities of earning &s;uch a reward? Is death to be feared that will convey thee to &s;o happy an exi&s;tence? Think not man made in vain, who

At length, &s;aid I, &s;hew me now, I be|&s;eech thee, the &s;ecrets that lie hid under tho&s;e dark clouds, which cover the ocean on the other &s;ide of the rock of adamant. The ge|nius making me no an&s;wer, I turned about to addre&s;s my&s;elf to him a &s;econd time, but I found he had left me; I then turned again to the vi&s;ion which I had been &s;o long contem|plating; but in&s;tead of the rolling tide, the arched bridge, and the happy i&s;lands, I &s;aw nothing but the long hollow vally of Bagdat, with oxen, &s;heep, and camels grazing upon the &s;ides of it.</P>

<HEAD>The VISION of AMANDA.</HEAD>
<P>METHOUGHT I was walking through a delightful field from whence on a ri&s;ing hill I beheld a &s;tately edifice. My curio&s;ity led me to make up towards it. I found it &s;urrounded with gardens and orchards, richly decked by nature and art. A mo&s;t agreeable lady was &s;tanding at the door who very courteou&s;ly in|vited me in to &s;it down and re&s;t me: being tir|ed with the hill, I accepted her kind offer.&mdash;Entering the hou&s;e, I &s;urveyed the magnificent apartments, and my eyes were dazzled with the rich furniture that adorned every room. The lady led me into a &s;pacious parlour, where was a very comely gentleman, with &s;everal little beauties around him, the living pictures in miniature of the father and mother. I was
<PB N="64" REF="032741_0064_0FF50AF8DF125498">
entertained there with a liberality &s;uitable to the appearance they made and with that cour|teous affability, which is the genuine effect of true gentility and good breeding. Whil&s;t with plea&s;ure I &s;urveyed their happy circum&s;tance, which appeared to have no want of any thing to complete their felicity, I &s;aid within my&s;elf; Sure the&s;e are extraordinary per&s;ons, and this flow of pro&s;perity mu&s;t be the bountiful reward of Providence, for &s;ome eminent in&s;tance of virtue and piety. But when I had taken my leave, and was returning back, I met one, of whom I enquired the gentleman's character who was the owner of yonder &s;eat; which, to my no &s;mall &s;urpri&s;e, I found to be very vi|cious. His plentiful e&s;tate was gotten by op|pre&s;&s;ion and fraud, his beautiful children were the living monuments of his &s;hame, and the la|dy who made &s;o &s;plendid an appearance, and to whom he di&s;covered &s;o much &s;eeming ten|derne&s;s was &s;o far from being mi&s;tre&s;s of the feat, that &s;he was only kept there as under a ty|rant, to be a &s;lave to his ba&s;e lu&s;ts, he con&s;ult|ing her &s;atisfaction no farther than as the plea&s;|ure in her countenance heightens her charms, and thereby renders her the more agreeable to him in the gratification of his bruti&s;h appetites and pa&s;&s;ions; and &s;he, continued my informer, puts a con&s;tant force upon her&s;elf to appear gay and cheerful, le&s;t her keeper &s;hould turn her out, abandoned to &s;hame and mi&s;ery. To pre&s;erve her from the latter of which (after

the lo&s;s of a good fortune) was &s;he prevailed on to comply with the lot &s;he &s;hares. As &s;oon as I parted from my company, I could con|tain no longer, but bur&s;t out into this excla|mation: Wherefore, O Pro&s;perity, wherefore is it that thou thus daily loade&s;t the vicious with thy benefits, and give&s;t them all that heart can wi&s;h? Whence comes it to pa&s;s, that &s;uch a wretch as this &s;hall &s;pend his days in ca&s;e, and his nights in plea&s;ure, whil&s;t thou turne&s;t away with di&s;dain from the pious man, leaving him to groan under all the hard&s;hips of the mo&s;t adver&s;e &s;tate!

I had no &s;ooner cea&s;ed exclaiming in this manner, than looking forward, I &s;aw Pro&s;perity &s;tanding be|fore me arrayed, in her mo&s;t gorgeous attire. The gay and glittering appearance mu&s;t have rai&s;ed delight in my brea&s;t, had it not been damped by the anger that appeared on her brow, when &s;he thus addre&s;&s;ed me; Forbear taxing me with partiality in my proceedings; for were it in my inclination, it is not in my power, being only the &s;ervant of Providence, who&s;e orders I never, in one &s;ingle in&s;tance, run counter to. Art thou, &s;aid I, in a heat, the &s;ervant of Providence? a ju&s;t, holy, wi&s;e, and powerful Providence! And will it &s;uffer thee thus to care&s;s the impious, and &s;light and contemn the good! How can the&s;e things be? Pro&s;perity di&s;appeared without making any re|ply; but immediately a re&s;plendant light &s;hone
<PB N="66" REF="032741_0066_0FF50B170F6E2648">
around me, and I heard a maje&s;tic voice call|ing thus to me from above, O thou blind mor|tal, do&s;t thou dare to call in que&s;tion my pro|ceedings, becau&s;e thou can&s;t not &s;ee the wi&s;dom and equity of them?

He is, re|plied he, a very eminent Chri&s;tian, a man greatly beloved of his God. But how contra|ry &s;oever this may &s;eem to your carnal rea&s;on, it is therefore that he is thus afflicted; he has (as the be&s;t here have) much &s;in &s;till remaining

And the &s;upports and comforts he &s;hall receive unden this heavy tri|al will &s;top the mouth of complaints, and force him to confe&s;s that God is the alone proper object of our warme&s;t affection, &s;ince there is enough in him to make the Chri&s;tian happy in the lo&s;s of the deare&s;t earthly comforts.

<P>I thanked my in&s;tructor, begged pardon for my ra&s;hne&s;s, and promi&s;ed, that I would no more arraign Divine Providence at the bar of my weak and &s;hallow rea&s;on; and aba&s;hed and confounded at my ignorance and pre&s;umption, awoke from my dream.</P>

<P>REMEMBER you are not made for your|&s;elves only, but for the &s;ociety and benefit of others, therefore employ your gifts, &s;ub&s;tances, and whatever God has be&s;towed for the good of others; teach the ignorant, relieve the poor, &s;trengthen the weak, comfort tho&s;e that are ca&s;t down, tell them your experiences, com|mend Chri&s;t as a choice ma&s;ter and lovely Sa|viour, and invite them to come, ta&s;te and &s;ee that he is good; pity tho&s;e who are &s;trangers to him, and pray for them. Be u&s;eful to oth|ers while you live, which will make your mem|ory &s;avoury when you die; many, alas, are &s;o unprofitable in their lives, that they leave no friends to mourn their death; but public &s;pirited and u&s;eful per&s;ons are much lamented. Let every one in their &s;tations be active and occupy their talents for God. Be a&s;&s;ured the

more you do for God in this world, the more God will do for you in the world to come. If the &s;aints were capable of grief in heaven, it would be for their doing &s;o little for God on earth.</P>

<P>JORDON, that famous river no doubt runs through many a plea&s;ant meadow, by many &s;hady grove and flowery bank, and yet at la&s;t empties it&s;elf into a dead &s;ea; and not only &s;o, but tho&s;e fre&s;h chry&s;tal &s;treams that made tho&s;e famous brooks, lo&s;e both name and worth, are turned into the dead &s;ea them&s;elves.
