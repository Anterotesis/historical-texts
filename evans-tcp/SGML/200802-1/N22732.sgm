<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE epidemic fever which made its ap|pearance in this city, at the latter end of the month of July la&s;t year, and which occa&s;ioned a degree of mortality among the people never experienced in &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace before, afforded matter of much &s;erious conver&s;ation, and gave ri&s;e to a great di|ver&s;ity of opinion. An idea was entertained by &s;ome, and this idea was, by others, in|du&s;triou&s;ly propagated abroad, that the di&s;|ea&s;e was imported from the We&s;t-Indies, and that it was <HI>contagious:</HI> while, on the other hand, many contended that a con|currence of local circum&s;tances, which de|rived an uncommon activity from a <HI>pecu|liar con&s;titution of the air,</HI> were alone &s;uf|ficient to account for its production.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="030041_0006_0FE411B44A5C9298">
It is the main object of the writer of this pamphlet to lay before the public a few facts on this important &s;ubject; and in do|ing this, he is con&s;cious that the chief merit of the&s;e will con&s;i&s;t in the diligence with which they were collected, and the fidelity with which they are detailed. He &s;hall purpo&s;ely avoid attacking any particular doctrines in medicine, relatively to the na|ture of the fever in que&s;tion; and the &s;ame temper will incline him to pa&s;s, without animadver&s;ion, the practice of tho&s;e who have &s;tood de&s;ervedly high in their profe&s;|&s;ion. He will therefore hold him&s;elf re|&s;pon&s;ible only for a <HI>faithful narrative.</HI>&mdash;It has, indeed, been thrown together under circum&s;tances very unfavourable to regular compo&s;ition; but as it &s;prung from no vain conceit of ability to render that clear, which has long been involved in ob&s;curity, he thinks he may rely on the purity of his motive for publi&s;hing it, as a &s;hield again&s;t the &s;everity of critici&s;m. The motive, as
<PB N="7" REF="030041_0007_0FE411E1C6CC20A8">
it fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted it&s;elf to his mind, was none other, than a de&s;ire to point out the <HI>real cau&s;es, as they appeared to him, of the late epidemic,</HI> and thereby, in &s;ome degree, to moderate individual apprehen&s;ion, and quiet popular alarm.</P>
<P>At the fir&s;t appearance of the di&s;ea&s;e, the following reports were diligently circu|lated, and very generally credited, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that Dr. Treat, then health officer of the port of New-York, had vi&s;ited the brig Zephyr, ju&s;t arrived from Port-au-Prince; that he found the crew &s;ickly; that &s;everal men had died on the pa&s;&s;age; that a boy had died the morning of her arrival; that Dr. Treat had incautiou&s;ly opened the dead body; that it was very generally tinged with a yellow colour; and that it was ex|tremely offen&s;ive to the &s;mell.</P>
<P>How corre&s;pondent the&s;e reports were with truth, will hereafter appear, from a &s;tatement of facts, &s;ub&s;tantiated by the te&s;|timony of indubitable authority.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="030041_0008_0FE411B755BC6848">
A few days after Dr. Treat vi&s;ited the brig Zephyr, about the 20th of July, he was &s;eized with fever. The manner of the attack, the nature and &s;everity of the &s;ub|&s;equent &s;ymptoms, attended with a yellow countenance, and a &s;imilar tinge of the &s;kin generally, were &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;titute the di&s;ea&s;e the <HI>yellow fever.</HI></P>
<P>About the &s;ame time that Dr. Treat be|came indi&s;po&s;ed, a fever, re&s;embling that of which he died, made its appearance on board the &s;hip William, &s;aid to be then lying at Fitch's wharf, nearly oppo&s;ite Dover-&s;treet. Shortly after, Augu&s;t 1&s;t, the family of Mr. Jenkins, living in Water-&s;treet, near Dover-&s;treet, was attacked with fever, which was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been communicated from the &s;hip William.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t it &s;eemed rather extraordinary, that the &s;hip William, which had &s;ailed directly from Liverpool to this place, and who&s;e men had been healthy during the pa&s;&s;age, &s;hould have contained matter of
<PB N="9" REF="030041_0009_0FE4119DCA66A4B8">
a contagious nature, which only operated upon the crew in producing fever &s;everal weeks after her arrival.</P>
<P>This difficulty, however, was &s;oon made to vani&s;h, and the explanation became ea&s;y, when it was alledged that the brig Zephyr, on board of which no one was &s;uppo&s;ed to doubt that the yellow fever exi&s;ted, had hauled along-&s;ide the &s;hip William, and thus communicated the di&s;ea&s;e to the &s;ailors.</P>
<P>This account, plau&s;ible in appearance, obtained almo&s;t univer&s;al credit, and though highly erroneous, as will hereafter be proved, was in a ha&s;ty and unauthoriz|ed way conveyed to Philadelphia, and, no doubt, afforded a con&s;iderable ground upon which the regulations that took place in that city, relative to this, were founded.</P>
<P>At this period the public mind laboured under great apprehen&s;ions. A new di&s;ea&s;e was &s;uppo&s;ed to have made its appearance. Several deaths had already happened, the
<PB N="10" REF="030041_0010_0FE411B95460A8D8">
nature of which, judging from the adven|titious circum&s;tance of colour, had an a&s;|pect extremely formidable. The progre&s;s, al&s;o, of the complaint, was &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;uch, that to tho&s;e who took things for granted, there remained but little doubt that the city would &s;oon be over&s;pread with contagion: and it cannot be &s;ufficiently regretted, that the &s;uppo&s;ed contagious na|ture of the di&s;ea&s;e was too much urged by tho&s;e who ought to have been more re|&s;erved in their opinion: for as yet no cir|cum&s;tances had really occurred to counten|ance or ju&s;tify the violent and exaggerated accounts which were circulated upon this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of affairs the torrent of opi|nion became irre&s;i&s;tible. Fear and di&s;may pervaded every mind; and tho&s;e of the in|habitants who were mo&s;t alarmed, as well as many of tho&s;e who had no particular motive for remaining in the city, &s;ought refuge in the country.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="030041_0011_0FE411E6578F6710">
In all &s;ituations in which our &s;afety be|comes a matter of con&s;iderable doubt, it is natural for us, after the panic, with which at fir&s;t we are apt to be &s;eized, has a little &s;ub&s;ided, to enquire what the chances are that we e&s;cape the danger. Accordingly, tho&s;e who remained in the city, and were at the trouble of inve&s;tigating the &s;ubject, found, that many examples had offered, where the &s;ick had been attended with im|punity: neither phy&s;icians, nor friends, nor attendants had imbibed any infection: and the circum&s;tances attending the very few in&s;tances which were &s;uppo&s;ed to favour the idea of contagion, were &s;o extremely ob&s;cure and doubtful, that nothing could be collected from them, of a nature at all &s;atisfactory. In confirmation of this, we have the declaration of the Medical Socie|ty, in an&s;wer to a letter from Governor Jay, dated 24th of September, 1795:&mdash;<Q>The collective opinion of this Society, as the re&s;ult of attentive ob&s;ervation, is, that
<PB N="12" REF="030041_0012_0FE411BB4AFD1088">
the fever is not &s;pecifically contagious; and we are confirmed in this opinion from the following powerful con&s;idera|tions, that neither relatives, nur&s;es, nor phy&s;icians have, &s;ave in one or two doubtful ca&s;es, been infected by attend|ing on tho&s;e who have either recovered or died of the di&s;ea&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>Much was daily urged from the&s;e facts; and finally, the terror with which the &s;up|po&s;ed contagious nature of the di&s;ea&s;e had filled people's minds, was in a great mea|&s;ure done away: and the confidence which took place, between the patient and phy&s;i|cian, as a con&s;equence of this conviction, was, I have no doubt, in many in&s;tances, a mean which greatly contributed to the recovery of the &s;ick.</P>
<P>Thus it would appear, from what has already been &s;aid, that a difference of opi|nion had exi&s;ted, as well among the citizens as the phy&s;icians, with re&s;pect to the real origin and character of the late epidemic.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="030041_0013_0FE411E8062935A0">
The object I have in view is to reconcile tho&s;e opinions, as far as that can be effected, by bringing into one view all the facts I have been able to collect upon the &s;ubject. The&s;e &s;hall form the principal data upon which any future rea&s;oning may be found|ed; and if the &s;entiments I may advance are found to differ from the opinion of others, I hope that a liberal and candid communication may tend to our mutual in|formation, and that the public may be bene|fited by our attempts to arrive at truth.</P>
<P>We &s;hall, therefore, in the next place, proceed to examine the validity of the opinion, that the brig Zephyr introduced a contagious fever into this city. And the following letters from Me&s;&s;rs. Arm&s;trong and Barnwell, and Miller and Hoope, are, in my mind, very explicit.</P>

<P>The brig Zephyr, Capt Frederick Bird, arrived from Port-au-Prince on or about the 19th of July la&s;t, loaded with &s;ugar and coffee. The cargo came to our ad|dre&s;s. She hauled fir&s;t to the Old-&s;lip, where her cargo was unloaded. The ve&s;&s;el leaked much on her pa&s;&s;age from Port-au-Prince, which damaged twenty-two hog&s;heads of coffee in the ground tier: in con&s;equence of which the ve&s;&s;el was ordered into the &s;tream, where the damaged coffee was thrown into the wa|ter, under the in&s;pection of the Wardens of the Port. One boy died on board the day of her arrival, who had been &s;ick all the pa&s;&s;age. The captain, mate, and one &s;eaman, were taken &s;ick at Port-au-Prince, and continued &s;o during the pa&s;|&s;age; but were perfectly re&s;tored to health &s;oon after their arrival. Dr. Treat vi&s;ited
<PB N="15" REF="030041_0015_0FE411E9F4298BD0">
the ve&s;&s;el on her arrival. The day was extremely hot, and he u&s;ed uncommon exertions in the middle of it, to find the commanding officer on Governor's I&s;land, to obtain permi&s;&s;ion to inter the boy there. He complained on his return, that the day and exerci&s;e had almo&s;t overcome him.</P>
<P>The ve&s;&s;el, after &s;he was unloaded, put up for freight for Baltimore, and took on board her cargo for thence at the Cof|fee-hou&s;e &s;lip. She was never near the &s;hip William, which laid at, or near Fitch's wharf. During the delivery of the inward cargo we were on board every day, as were al&s;o the Wardens of the Port; and we have not learned that any per&s;on has been taken ill in con&s;equence.</P>
<P>We under&s;tand that the captain pro|ceeded to Baltimore in the ve&s;&s;el, and the mate to Bo&s;ton. However, as they were more immediately under the direc|tion of Me&s;&s;rs. Miller and Hoope, to
<PB N="16" REF="030041_0016_0FE411C14A299BB8">
whom the ve&s;&s;el was con&s;igned, we refer to them for particulars in that re&s;pect. We were informed by Capt. Bird that it was &s;ickly at Port-au-Prince when he was there in June and July, which is ge|nerally the ca&s;e at that &s;ea&s;on, but that it was &s;carcely known among the French inhabitants, and fell chiefly on the Bri|ti&s;h and Americans. He al&s;o told us that the place was growing more healthy when he left it.</P>

<P>The brig Zephyr, of Bo&s;ton, Capt. Bird, came addre&s;&s;ed to our hou&s;e from Port-au-Prince; her cargo, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ugar, coffee, and hides, was addre&s;&s;ed to Me&s;&s;rs. Arm&s;trong and Barnwell. The brig hauled to the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Old-&s;lip, and there di&s;charged her cargo, ex|cept
<PB N="17" REF="030041_0017_0FE411EBA1797D10">
a quantity of damaged coffee, which was thrown into the Ea&s;t-river. The brig was then hauled to the end of Jones's wharf, below the Coffee-hou&s;e, and took in her cargo for Baltimore.</P>
<P>Capt. Bird and all his crew were &s;ick leaving Port-au-Prince, and one of them died the day or day after the brig arrived.</P>

<P>The foregoing letters afford an unequi|vocal te&s;timony of the condition of the crew of the brig Zephyr, on her arrival in this port. They afford, al&s;o, a complete refutation of the a&s;&s;ertion, that the Zephyr communicated a contagious fever to the &s;hip William, the two ve&s;&s;els having never been near one another: and, in &s;hort, they &s;hew, that, excepting the death of the boy,
<PB N="18" REF="030041_0018_0FE411C2F4CA3C88">
the reports circulated concerning the Ze|phyr, at the fir&s;t appearance of the fever, and indeed believed by many during its continuance, were altogether without foundation.</P>
<P>When it was di&s;covered that the brig Zephyr had not been nearer the &s;hip Wil|liam than half a mile, &s;o wedded were in|dividuals to the idea of imported contagion, that they fixed on the brig Active, which had ju&s;t arrived from Martinique, as the contagious ve&s;&s;el. But the following letters from Me&s;&s;rs. Lawrence and Van Zandt will be found to contain facts as little fa|vourable to the opinion, that contagion had been communicated from the Active, as has been proved with re&s;pect to the brig Zephyr.</P>

<P>It affords us &s;incere plea&s;ure to furni&s;h you with &s;uch facts as came within our knowledge, concerning the brig Active,
<PB N="19" REF="030041_0019_0FE411EFB516E1A0">
&s;uppo&s;ed to have been one of tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els which introduced a contagious di&s;ea&s;e in|to this city. The &s;aid brig &s;ailed from this port on the 9th of April la&s;t, bound to the We&s;t-Indies, navigated by Capt. Mathew Rogers, a mate, and five hands. After touching at &s;everal i&s;lands for a market, &s;he finally arrived at Martinique, where the captain di&s;po&s;ed of her cargo, and received in payment thirty-&s;ix hog|&s;heads of mola&s;&s;es, and the re&s;idue in bills of exchange on this city. He al&s;o re|ceived on board, on freight, and con&s;igned to Me&s;&s;rs. Concklin and Loyd, merchants here, one hundred and thirty-four bales of ca&s;&s;ia, commonly called wild honey. This and the mola&s;&s;es con&s;tituted the whole of her return cargo. The &s;aid brig &s;ailed from Martinique on the 30th of June, bound for this port, and arrived here the 22d of July. Seventeen days previous to her arrival, &s;he lo&s;t one man by &s;ickne&s;s, and from information receiv|ed
<PB N="20" REF="030041_0020_0FE411C4E59DEDB8">
from the captain, he died with a fever, the nature of which he could not a&s;cer|tain, but &s;uppo&s;ed it was brought on by the u&s;e of liquor, of which the decea&s;ed would, previous to his &s;ickne&s;s, drink large quantities. After his body was committed to the waves, the captain, for three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive days, had the birth, bed|ding, and every thing belonging to the decea&s;ed, carefully cleaned, under his own in&s;pection. The re&s;idue of her crew enjoyed a full &s;tate of health during the voyage, and were all perfectly well on her arrival in this port. Her cargo was landed at Fitch's wharf, partly by her crew and partly by labourers: nor do we know an in&s;tance of any one of them being &s;ick after their di&s;charge from the ve&s;&s;el. She remained at Fitch's wharf about three weeks; at which time we di&s;po&s;ed of her to Mr. Orange Webb, merchant of this city, who immediately loaded her and &s;ent her to &s;ea.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>In pur&s;uance of your reque&s;t, I ye&s;ter|day &s;aw Capt. Rogers, late ma&s;ter of the brig Active, who tells me he hauled along &s;ide of Fitch's wharf on Friday the 24th of July la&s;t, and that he began to break bulk the next day, being Saturday the 25th.</P>
<P>He further a&s;&s;ures me, that a number of his acquaintance were on board the brig every day, and that he has &s;ince &s;een
<PB N="22" REF="030041_0022_0FE411C694623360">
&s;everal of them, none of whom have been taken with the late di&s;order.</P>
<P>I was repeatedly on board, and in the cabin: once in particular, before &s;he hauled along &s;ide the wharf, I was in the hold of the brig, and examined the cargo; but as I was not taken with the di&s;order until the 5th of September following, (although I lived near Peck-&s;lip, where the di&s;ea&s;e fir&s;t began to rage) I am confi|dent I never took it on board Captain Rogers' brig.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, Sir, &amp;c. BENJAMIN STRONG.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>The preceding letters leave little doubt with re&s;pect to the healthful &s;tate of the brig Active. It appears that &s;he arrived in port on the 22d of July: on the 23d &s;he laid on the out&s;ide of a ve&s;&s;el at the end of Fitch's wharf: on the 24th &s;he hauled into the &s;lip; and on the 25th of July &s;he broke bulk.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="030041_0023_0FE3F1825066D270">
Hitherto it has been &s;uppo&s;ed, that the &s;hip William al&s;o laid at Fitch's wharf; but the truth is, that this ve&s;&s;el did not, at any period this &s;ea&s;on, lie at that wharf. Her &s;ituation, at fir&s;t, was at the wharf of Lawrence and Kipp, about fifty yards we&s;t|ward of Fitch's; and on the 24th of July &s;he removed to Rutgers' wharf, di&s;tant about half a mile from her fir&s;t &s;tation.</P>
<P>Upon a compari&s;on of the&s;e &s;tatements it will appear, 1&s;t, that the ve&s;&s;els above named were never nearer one another than fifty yards; and, 2dly, that the day before the Active began to unload, the William was removed to the di&s;tance of half a mile. Thus it is &s;hewn how little foundation there was for a report of a fever being com|municated from the brig Active to the &s;hip William.</P>
<P>The next &s;ubject of &s;u&s;picion was a par|cel of cotton, which had been imported in the brig Caroline, and which was depo&s;ited in the &s;tore of Lawrence and Mott, at the
<PB N="24" REF="030041_0024_0FE411C9E450F770">
foot of Dover-&s;treet. It was reported that a man had thru&s;t his arm into a bag of da|maged cotton, and that, when he withdrew it, the arm, from the virulence of the con|tagion, was of a livid colour. However extravagant this declaration may &s;eem, there were not wanting tho&s;e who &s;ub|&s;cribed to its credit. In &s;hort, &s;o infatuated were &s;ome of the inhabitants with the be|lief of imported contagion, that they &s;u&s;|pected every ve&s;&s;el, which had arrived from the We&s;t-Indies previous to the late epide|mic, to have brought contagion in her.</P>
<P>With regard to the &s;u&s;pected cotton, the following certificates will give the nece&s;|&s;ary information:&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>I, John Church, ma&s;ter of the brig Caroline, of New-York, do certify, that the fifty-one bales of cotton, &s;hipped on board the &s;aid brig Caroline, about the 20th of June, 1795, was purcha&s;ed by me in the neighbourhood of Lance and Veau, and was never on board any ve&s;&s;el

I have thus advanced &s;uch documents, upon the &s;ubject of imported contagion, as, from a careful enquiry, I have been able to collect. From this inve&s;tigation the public is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch information, as may be made the ba&s;is of a tolerably ac|curate judgment; and I have little he&s;ita|tion in believing, that the conclu&s;ion na|turally re&s;ulting from the premi&s;es, will be extremely unfavourable, if not ab&s;olutely again&s;t the opinion which &s;ome have &s;o warmly embraced, that the cau&s;e of the late epidemic was imported contagion.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t now take the liberty of recur|ring to a further con&s;ideration of circum|&s;tances relative to the brig Zephyr.</P>
<P>From the &s;tatements contained in the letters already in&s;erted, regarding this ve&s;|&s;el, &s;everal facts of con&s;iderable importance are made to appear, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that no per&s;on died on board the Zephyr, during the whole of her voyage, except the boy already men|tioned; that all tho&s;e of the crew who had
<PB N="27" REF="030041_0027_0FE411F5122850C0">
been taken &s;ick at Port-au-Prince, and had become convale&s;cent, &s;oon got well after her arrival in this harbour; and that nei|ther the wardens of the port, the con&s;ignees, nor any other per&s;on who had been tran|&s;iently on board the Zephyr, except Doctor Treat, &s;uffered any bad con&s;equences from their vi&s;its.&mdash;The que&s;tion then occurs, Did Doctor Treat take the di&s;ea&s;e, of which he died, from the Zephyr?</P>
<P>It was a circum&s;tance well known, that the health of Doctor Treat was generally impaired. His &s;tomach was in a &s;tate of con&s;tant di&s;order; and this, independent of other effects, was, at particular periods, ac|companied with &s;uch extreme dejection of &s;pirits, that he did not, as he had often a&s;|&s;ured me, expect to live from one day to another. The Doctor had been complain|ing more than common for &s;everal days before he vi&s;ited the Zephyr. He embarked in a &s;mall open boat at mid-day, with a black hat on his head, and without an um|brella,
<PB N="28" REF="030041_0028_0FE411CD832F71E8">
which he had always been accu&s;|tomed to u&s;e, to defend him from the &s;un's rays. The day was calm, extremely hot, and the ve&s;&s;el at lea&s;t one mile and a half from the place of his departure. It is al&s;o &s;tated, that he was much fatigued, upon Governor's I&s;land, in &s;earching for the commanding officer.</P>
<P>Thus, then, it would appear as matter of fact, fir&s;t, that Doctor Treat was indi&s;|po&s;ed at the time he vi&s;ited the Zephyr: &s;econdly, that in performing that duty he was expo&s;ed, for &s;everal hours, to the ex|treme heat of the &s;un; and, thirdly, that he encountered con&s;iderable bodily fatigue. If the&s;e circum&s;tances are well con&s;idered, and that peculiar &s;tate of the weather, which predi&s;po&s;es to fever, is taken into the e&s;timate, is it unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that the fever with which Doctor Treat was attacked, might have originated from the operation of &s;uch a combination of cau&s;es? Every candid phy&s;ician will give
<PB N="29" REF="030041_0029_0FE411F7D1CD8E60">
a negative an&s;wer to the que&s;tion. But we &s;hall not be very &s;olicitous to prove, that Doctor Treat did not contract his di&s;ea&s;e in this manner&mdash;We grant that he might have received <HI>infection</HI> from the Zephyr; but does it nece&s;&s;arily follow, that it &s;hould have cau&s;ed a <HI>contagious</HI> fever? A con&s;i|deration of the con&s;equences, in a variety of parallel ca&s;es, will contribute much to the formation of an opinion upon this &s;ub|ject.&mdash;The following is con&s;idered illu&s;tra|tive of this point.</P>
<P>At the termination of the late war be|tween the United States and Great-Britain, Colonel William Smith, of this city, was appointed, by General Wa&s;hington, to re|&s;ide in New-York, with the con&s;ent of Sir Guy Carlton, for the purpo&s;e of &s;uperin|tending the evacuation of the country, and to &s;ee that it was performed agreeably to the treaty. In the exerci&s;e of this duty, he had frequent occa&s;ion to go between the decks, and into the holds of ve&s;&s;els. In
<PB N="30" REF="030041_0030_0FE411CF72D0D1D0">
the cour&s;e of the&s;e vi&s;its, he was &s;eized with (what is commonly denominated a &s;hip-fever) a bilious remitting fever. After a few days, the fever happily intermitted, and Colonel Smith &s;oon recovered a toler|able &s;hare of &s;trength.</P>
<P>It was thought proper to caution him again&s;t the danger he would incur by re|peating his vi&s;its on board &s;hip. He an|&s;wered, that the duty was indi&s;pen&s;ible. The con&s;equence was, he contracted a &s;e|cond fever. The fir&s;t of the attack was attended with a &s;en&s;e of coldne&s;s, which was &s;oon &s;ucceeded by violent pain in the head. His countenance was flu&s;hed, and his eyes were very red. The third day his neck and brea&s;t took on a yellow appear|ance; and in forty-eight hours, the whole of his body became as yellow as an orange. From the acce&s;&s;ion of his fever to its ter|mination, his heat was &s;o con&s;iderable, that on feeling his pul&s;e, or gra&s;ping his wri&s;t, the &s;en&s;ation communicated was &s;imilar to
<PB N="31" REF="030041_0031_0FE411FA098FEFE0">
the &s;ting of nettles, or very fine needles pricking the hand.</P>
<P>Colonel Smith lodged at Mr. Depey&s;ter's in Pearl-&s;treet, and notwith&s;tanding the unremitting attention he received from the family, the di&s;ea&s;e was not communicated to one of his attendants.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>'Sometimes only one man in a ship may be seized with the petechial, or with the yellow fever, while all the rest continue unaffected: of this the Magnamine afforded an instance,' &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>'Another person was sent from the Raven sloop, in the yellow fever, of which he also died; and yet no other per|son on board of those two ships were, either before or af|terwards, taken ill of such fevers.'</P>

<P>I have twice, in the pur&s;uit of my avo|cations, imbibed infectious fevers&mdash;once on &s;hip-board; and again on vi&s;iting a pri&s;on. I was handled very &s;everely in both in&s;tances, and deprived of my &s;en&s;es &s;everal days during each confinement. My attendants were numerous, and vigilant;
<PB N="32" REF="030041_0032_0FE411D230722D08">
yet no one &s;uffered from contact with my body, or from breathing the air of my chamber.</P>
<P>As favourable to the &s;ame conclu&s;ions with the above in&s;tances, and tending to illu&s;trate the doctrine we are endeavouring to e&s;tabli&s;h, we &s;hall here introduce the hi&s;tory of a fever which raged among the men of Mon&s;. De la Motte's fleet, in 1757.</P>
<P>A fleet, under the command of Mon&s;. De la Motte, &s;ailed from Bre&s;t on the third day of May, 1757, for Loui&s;burg, in Nova-Scotia. A number of &s;ailors (about two hundred) who had been confined in Roch|fort ho&s;pital, with putrid fever, and had become convale&s;cent, were embarked on board the Glorieux and Duc de Burgogne, &s;hips of war. The&s;e &s;hips had been two years in a &s;tate of equipment, and mo&s;t of that time at &s;ea; they, therefore, could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been very clean. The other &s;hips of the fleet had lain &s;ome time in the harbour of Bre&s;t, and were not in a
<PB N="33" REF="030041_0033_0FE411FBFA45A5F8">
very healthy condition. On board the different ve&s;&s;els were al&s;o di&s;tributed four hundred &s;ailors, who had ju&s;t returned from confinement in the Engli&s;h pri&s;ons. The &s;hips' companies became &s;ickly on their pa&s;&s;age, particularly tho&s;e of the Glorieux and Burgogne; and on the 20th of June they arrived at Loui&s;burg. The wind was fair during the pa&s;&s;age, blowing mo&s;tly from the &s;outh-ea&s;t; and the weather was &s;o favourable and temperate, that it was found unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;hut the port-holes or clo&s;e the hatch-ways.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the fleet arrived at Loui&s;burg, the different &s;hips had their tents pitched on &s;hore, for the accommodation of the &s;ick; and they were accordingly di&s;em|barked immediately. The tents were pitched too near one another, and hence the &s;ick did not receive all the advantages which they might have derived from their &s;ituation.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="030041_0034_0FE411D427494040">
The particular &s;tate of the &s;ick during the months of July and Augu&s;t, their number, or the mortality which prevailed, is not mentioned. But it is ob&s;erved, that the number of the &s;ick was greatly aug|mented during the latter part of September. This aro&s;e from two cau&s;es; fir&s;t, from the nece&s;&s;ity they were under of collecting all their &s;trength from the different ve&s;&s;els, to fini&s;h works, in order to defend the city: &s;econdly, from a &s;evere gale of wind, which happened on the 25th of September, and threatened de&s;truction to the whole fleet. Several &s;hips were in particular danger, to &s;ave which, the united exertions of officers and &s;ailors were required; and in perform|ing this duty, the men were unavoidably expo&s;ed to exce&s;&s;ive labour and extreme bad weather. After this, the &s;ick became more numerous; and by the 30th of October, the day on which the fleet left Loui&s;burg for Bre&s;t, the &s;ick amounted to fourteen hundred. Of this number, four hundred
<PB N="35" REF="030041_0035_0FE411FDA87F37D0">
of the wor&s;t ca&s;es were left at Loui&s;burg, in bad lodgings, and under the management of few, and tho&s;e un&s;kilful attendants.</P>
<P>The fleet had not been at &s;ea more than &s;ix days, before mo&s;t of tho&s;e who were &s;ick at the time of &s;ailing, with many others, died. The pa&s;&s;age was attended with very boi&s;terous weather; and the &s;ea ran &s;o high, that the ports were obliged to be kept &s;hut. Under circum&s;tances &s;o uncomfortable, the malady &s;pread with great rapidity, and on the arrival of the fleet at Bre&s;t, which hap|pened on the 22d of November, the num|ber of the &s;ick amounted to four thou&s;and.</P>
<P>Fifteen days before the return of De la Motte's fleet, the two &s;hips of war, Bizarre and Cel&egrave;bre, arrived in Bre&s;t harbour from Canada. The crews of the&s;e &s;hips were affected with a complaint &s;imilar to the one which prevailed on board the Loui&s;burg fleet; and they had already &s;ent one thou|&s;and men to the ho&s;pitals at Bre&s;t. The ho&s;pitals, therefore, were found crouded;
<PB N="36" REF="030041_0036_0FE411D61E212280">
and for the accommodation of the &s;ick newly arrived, temporary ho&s;pitals were erected. Into the&s;e the &s;ick were hurried from the &s;hips, in cold and wet weather, and thrown together in heaps(enta&s;&s;&eacute; p&eacute;l&eacute; m&eacute;l&eacute;). Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, little benefit was obtained from the means em|ployed for their relief.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e raged, with unrelenting violence, from the 22d of November to the la&s;t of February. It began to dimini&s;h in the month of March, and cea&s;ed entirely in April. But it was remarked, that this cruel di&s;ea&s;e did not cea&s;e until it had de|&s;troyed &s;o many men, that tho&s;e who re|mained had, in con&s;equence, an opportu|nity of enjoying all the advantages of breathing a pure air, of cleanline&s;s, and good attendance.</P>
<P>The number that died in the ho&s;pitals at Bre&s;t, at this period, was not le&s;s than ten thou&s;and, be&s;ides a con&s;iderable number in the city.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="030041_0037_0FE4120161F920D8">
Of the four hundred men left at Loui&s;|burg, who appeared to be in a condition from which a recovery could not be ex|pected, badly accommodated, and wor&s;e attended, three hundred and eighty were cured.</P>
<P>The foregoing is an epitomized narra|tive of a voyage from Bre&s;t to Loui&s;burg, in which is related the prevalence and mortality of a fever, which the author of the account denominates PUTRID, MA|LIGNANT, CONTAGIOUS, and PESTILEN|TIAL.</P>
<P>A con&s;ideration of the circum&s;tances at|tending this expedition, and the &s;tate of a con&s;iderable part of the men employed on the occa&s;ion, will readily, I apprehend, explain the fatality attending it, without recurring to the &s;uppo&s;ition of the di&s;ea&s;e being, in its nature, e&s;&s;entially <HI>contagious</HI> or <HI>pe&s;tilential.</HI></P>
<P>It will have been perceived before this, that we have been &s;omewhat &s;olicitous to
<PB N="38" REF="030041_0038_0FE4120332596780">
e&s;tabli&s;h a di&s;tinction between di&s;ea&s;es which are <HI>infectious,</HI> and tho&s;e which are <HI>contagious.</HI> By contagion we under&s;tand &s;omething <HI>peculiar</HI> and <HI>&s;pecific,</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing properties <HI>e&s;&s;entially</HI> different from any thing el&s;e. Thus the contagion of the &s;mall-pox, the mea&s;les, &amp;c. Tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es do not require the concurrence of certain cau&s;es to render them contagious; they are &s;o under <HI>all</HI> circum&s;tances. But other di&s;|ea&s;es may, or may <HI>not</HI> be <HI>infectious,</HI> according to the conditional &s;tate in which they are placed. Thus a fever &s;hall continue days, or even weeks, without giving ri&s;e to the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion that it has, in any in&s;tance, been the cau&s;e of fever in any per&s;on, who may have been, either a frequent vi&s;itor, or con&s;tant attendant: whil&s;t a fever, ac|companied with the &s;ame &s;ymptoms and appearances, and not more violent in de|gree, &s;hall be communicated from one to another, and extend to incalculable lengths, &s;o long as the circum&s;tances exi&s;t which
<PB N="39" REF="030041_0039_0FE4120526114510">
favour its propagation. Agreeably to this difinition, may be explained the &s;low, or rapid progre&s;s of the fever of the Loui&s;burg fleet, at different periods.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate this more fully, we &s;hall take a review of the circum&s;tances attend|ing that fleet, from the time of its &s;ailing from Bre&s;t harbour, to its return to that port, and the after di&s;po&s;al of the men.</P>
<P>The convale&s;cents from Rochfort ho&s;|pital received on board the fleet, had been weakened by a previous di&s;ea&s;e; the na|ture of which we pre&s;ume not to have been contagious, becau&s;e no mention is made of it. They were ordered into &s;hips which had been the greate&s;t part of two years at &s;ea, and in a condition, it is &s;tated, not very favourable to the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of health. The con&s;equence was, that mo&s;t of the&s;e unfortunate men had a return of fever, and this fever became in|fectious. The fever, it is &s;aid, was com|municated to &s;ome of the &s;hips' company
<PB N="40" REF="030041_0040_0FE41206D33607A0">
during the pa&s;&s;age to Loui&s;burg. We have no doubt of the fact. But we by no means admit this as a proof of the contagious nature of the di&s;ea&s;e. It is very common for fevers to become <HI>infectious,</HI> when a number of &s;ick are crowded together in confined apartments; and on &s;hip-board they are particularly liable to become &s;o, from the impo&s;&s;ibility of ventilation in &s;ome in&s;tances, and the neglect of it in others. Here, too, it often happens, that, for want of room, the well are compelled to lie with, or near the &s;ick, and to breathe an air rendered extremely noxious from the ab&s;traction of that part which is e&s;&s;en|tial to animal vigour, and from a combi|nation of the different effluvia ari&s;ing from the &s;ick, the dying, and perhaps the dead. Hence a cau&s;e appears why &s;hip-fevers are often communicated with &s;o much facility, and are a cau&s;e of &s;o great a mortality.</P>
<P>But in the ca&s;e now more immediately under con&s;ideration, the exten&s;ion of the
<PB N="41" REF="030041_0041_0FE4120B1EB04708">
fever, beyond tho&s;e who came on board in a debilitated &s;tate, did not take place in many in&s;tances; and the rea&s;on is evident:&mdash;The weather, during the pa&s;&s;age from Bre&s;t to Loui&s;burg, was &s;o mild, that the port-holes (the windows of a &s;hip they might be called) and hatch-ways were permitted to be generally open, by which means a circulation of air was kept up be|tween decks, and thus the cau&s;es of infec|tion were, in a great mea&s;ure, carried away. The fine weather, al&s;o, allowing the men to be chiefly on deck, was another rea&s;on why the crews were not more &s;ickly.</P>
<P>The narrative does not mention the &s;tate, nor the number of the &s;ick during the months of July and Augu&s;t. It &s;ays, "On a perd&icirc;t quelqu'un."</P>
<P>If this fever had been contagious, ought it not to have &s;pread more generally during the &s;ummer months? "Il repandit tres peu." I pre&s;ume that a contagious di&s;ea&s;e among &s;o many people would have been &s;o
<PB N="42" REF="030041_0042_0FE4120CCD778668">
generally experienced, that a particular account of it would have been kept, and reported in the general &s;tatement.</P>
<P>To promote the object of the expedition, it was thought nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ome time in Sep|tember, to collect all the men of the fleet, and throw up works, in order to defend the town. The exertions that were made on this occa&s;ion greatly augmented the num|ber of the &s;ick; and this effect was attri|buted to the contagious nature of the di&s;|ea&s;e. But I apprehend the cau&s;e to have been <HI>over-fatigue,</HI> and of that &s;ort to which the men had not been accu&s;tomed: to which we may add, expo&s;ure to inclement weather, and a &s;carcity of provi&s;ions, and tho&s;e of a bad quality.</P>
<P>On the 25th of September, a &s;evere gale of wind happened. This nece&s;&s;arily occa|&s;ioned a great degree of expo&s;ure, and much fatigue. From the&s;e cau&s;es the &s;ick be|came more numerous; and the number increa&s;ed till the period of their departure
<PB N="43" REF="030041_0043_0FE4120E763EB030">
from Loui&s;burg, which was on the 30th of October, when fourteen hundred were upon the li&s;t. Of the&s;e it was thought that four hundred of the mo&s;t de&s;perate and hopele&s;s ca&s;es &s;hould remain at Loui&s;|burg.</P>
<P>The fleet had not been at &s;ea more than &s;ix days before mo&s;t of tho&s;e who were ill at the time of &s;ailing, with many others, were dead; and by the time that the fleet arrived at Bre&s;t, which was on the 22d of November, four thou&s;and &s;ailors were con|fined with fever.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider the circum&s;tances of the pa&s;&s;age, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the &s;tate of the men taken on board the fleet; the condition of them af|terwards, owing to boi&s;terous weather, which rendered clo&s;e confinement nece&s;&s;a|ry, and a proper ventilation impracticable, we need not be &s;urpri&s;ed that the fever &s;hould have prevailed &s;o generally, nor that the mortality &s;hould have been &s;o con&s;ider|able. The air between decks, in a &s;tagnant
<PB N="44" REF="030041_0044_0FE4121076AD40E0">
&s;tate, and in which &s;o many &s;ick were crouded together, could not fail of be|coming infectious: and the heat, as well as the moi&s;ture, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily exi&s;t in &s;uch &s;ituations, would give a parti|cular activity and virulence to the infec|tion. And in this way we may account for the propagation and fatal tendency of the di&s;ea&s;e, without &s;uppo&s;ing it to have had any thing in its nature &s;pecifically contagious.</P>
<P>After the arrival of the fleet at Bre&s;t, the men were placed under circum&s;tances as little favourable to their recovery, as they were before their debarkation. They were &s;ent to ho&s;pitals, too &s;mall to contain them, &s;ave in a &s;tate extremely crouded; and there were not attendants in &s;ufficient number to take proper care of the &s;ick, and to pre&s;erve cleanline&s;s.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, &s;o confined was the air, and &s;o impregnated with the foul vapours, ari&s;ing from the &s;ick, that, on entering the
<PB N="45" REF="030041_0045_0FE41213AAFBA598">
ho&s;pital, it is ob&s;erved, a per&s;on found him|&s;elf &s;urrounded by an air &s;o extremely warm, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a cadaverous odour, &s;o di&s;agreeable to breathe, that one who had not been accu&s;tomed to it, could not remain expo&s;ed to its operation but for a few mi|nutes, without feeling a pain in the head.</P>
<P>When, from the great numbers who died, the ho&s;pital became &s;o thinned, and the &s;ick &s;o few, that they received all the advantages of pure air, good attendance, a due ob&s;ervance of cleanline&s;s, proper me|dicines, &amp;c. the progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e was &s;oon arre&s;ted, and in a &s;hort time it finally di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>Now, when the preceding hi&s;tory is well con&s;idered, together with the conclu&s;ions drawn from the facts therein &s;tated, it will appear, that the fever of De la Motte's fleet ought to be arranged under the head of <HI>in|fectious</HI> di&s;ea&s;es, and not that of a conta|gious one.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="030041_0046_0FE41215CA6A5608">
But if it &s;hould &s;till be urged, that there was contagion in the ca&s;e, and at the &s;ame time we admit, (which <HI>facts</HI> compel us to grant) that a free air, and other circum&s;tan|ces, will &s;top the progre&s;s of a contagious di&s;ea&s;e, nay, de&s;troy its contagious property, the conce&s;&s;ion is all we wi&s;h to obtain, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h our doctrine of the nature of <HI>infectious fevers.</HI></P>
<P>As a corroborating fact to our opinion, it will be proper to remark the a&s;toni&s;hing recovery of three hundred and eighty, out of the four hundred wor&s;t ca&s;es, that were left at Loui&s;burg.

We find upon record, numberle&s;s ex|amples of people having received infection of the mo&s;t &s;erious nature, from going out of the healthy air of the common atmo&s;|phere, into confined places; &s;uch as dun|geons, crouded pri&s;ons, or between the decks of ve&s;&s;els, where fevers have pre|vailed. But there is not an in&s;tance within my recollection or ob&s;ervation, where a per&s;on, having imbibed &s;uch infection, and where cleanline&s;s, keeping the room well aired, and other proper attentions have been ob&s;erved, has communicated the di&s;|ea&s;e, either to occa&s;ional vi&s;itors, nur&s;es, friends, or relatives: and the particulars of Doctor Treat's ca&s;e will furni&s;h another analogous fact.</P>
<P>He went on board the Zephyr, and, as his duty required, de&s;cended into the hold, or between decks, to a&s;certain the &s;tate of the ve&s;&s;el, as it regarded infection. In doing this, we will &s;uppo&s;e that he expo&s;ed him&s;elf to foul and &s;tagnant air, rendered
<PB N="48" REF="030041_0048_0FE4121969F5B300">
particularly noxious by the exhalations which pa&s;&s;ed off before and immediately after the boy's death.</P>
<P>A day or two afterwards he began to complain. Where he re&s;ided, there was a family about him. His &s;i&s;ter, particularly during his illne&s;s, was a con&s;tant attendant at his bed-&s;ide. His numerous friends were pre&s;&s;ing around him to his la&s;t moments. Several of them a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the execution of the means pre&s;cribed for his relief, when they had direct contact with his body, and were more immediately expo&s;ed to what|ever aro&s;e from it:&mdash;Yet the fever was in no in&s;tance communicated to a &s;econd per|&s;on.</P>
<P>If, then, the Doctor's di&s;ea&s;e had been <HI>&s;pecifically</HI> contagious, ought we not to have expected an unequivocal manife&s;tation of it, in &s;ome of tho&s;e who were placed under circum&s;tances &s;o favourable for receiving contagion?</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="030041_0049_0FE4121E24328E48">
Many people were confirmed in the opinion, that the fever was contagious, from the vague reports of examples having occurred, where per&s;ons were infected with fever in the country, in con&s;equence of having had a communication with tho&s;e who had carried the di&s;ea&s;e from the city. Now, I believe, there are not any well au|thenticated ca&s;es of this &s;ort: and if a few &s;olitary in&s;tances are offered in &s;upport of the contagious nature of the di&s;ea&s;e, which, however, are very ob&s;cure, they prove very little when compared with the uniform confinement of the di&s;order to tho&s;e who were immediately expo&s;ed to the fir&s;t cau&s;es which produced the complaint.</P>
<P>We have already admitted that the air of a room in which a per&s;on is lying with a bilious remitting fever, may become in|fectious, if ventilation is not performed; if all excrementitious matter is not &s;peedily removed, and if the bedding and clothing of the patient are not in due time changed.
<PB N="50" REF="030041_0050_0FE4121FEF7523B0">
And if the fever has ari&s;en in the country, in the manner the reports above &s;tated ex|pre&s;s, I pre&s;ume infection has been the cau&s;e, and not contagion; for all that has hitherto been alledged is, that one or two in&s;tances have happened, where people have taken the di&s;ea&s;e, from the many of tho&s;e who have &s;ickened in the country after leaving the city; not that the di&s;ea&s;e has &s;pread through a neighbourhood or a village.</P>
<P>I pre&s;ume it is &s;ufficiently proved by this time, that the late epidemic fever was not brought here from abroad; and, al&s;o, that there exi&s;ts in nature, and that there ought to be made, a di&s;tinction between <HI>infectious</HI> and <HI>contagious</HI> di&s;orders. Much more might be &s;aid upon the&s;e &s;ubjects, and a variety of te&s;timony added; but, without fatigu|ing the reader, by entering into a farther di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the&s;e que&s;tions, I &s;hall proceed to enquire into tho&s;e cau&s;es which may,
<PB N="51" REF="030041_0051_0FE41221E35CEAE0">
with great probability, be con&s;idered as productive of the late epidemic.</P>
<P>During the months of January and Feb|ruary, 1795, the weather was unu&s;ually variable; the lowe&s;t degree to which the thermometer fell was five degrees of Fa|renheit's &s;cale, and it ro&s;e as high as forty-&s;ix degrees.</P>
<P>The weather of the &s;ucceeding &s;pring, during the months of March and April, was al&s;o very variable, and was attended with a greater degree of cold and wet than common. This was remarkably evidenced by their effects upon vegetation. Trees put forth their buds, and blo&s;&s;omed later, than is u&s;ual in ordinary &s;ea&s;ons.</P>
<P>As the &s;ea&s;on advanced, the weather became warmer; but the moi&s;ture of the air was in no degree dimini&s;hed. This &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere continued during the &s;ummer months. The acce&s;&s;ion of heat was &s;low, but by the latter end of July it became exce&s;&s;ive, and continued &s;o
<PB N="52" REF="030041_0052_0FE4122392C73488">
generally during Augu&s;t and the fir&s;t part of September. The effects of this hot and moi&s;t air was remarkable in the production of mould.</P>
<P>It was a very common complaint, that hardly any thing could be kept without be|coming mouldy. Books, which had re|mained for years in libraries and other places, became covered with this &s;ub|&s;tance. Shoes and boots, thrown a&s;ide only a day or two, contracted an abundance of mould; and the wooden floors, and pa|pered walls of family rooms which were clo&s;ed a few days only, and even in &s;ome in&s;tances where the rooms were daily ex|po&s;ed to a free acce&s;s of air, which before had always remained perfectly dry, now generated a great quantity of mould.</P>
<P>The prevailing con&s;titution of the air produced remarkable effects upon cab|bages. It was ob&s;erved, that this vegeta|ble grew with uncommon rapidity to its u&s;ual &s;ize, and with the appearance of
<PB N="53" REF="030041_0053_0FE41228093FFF08">
great health and vigour; it would then &s;uddenly a&s;&s;ume an unhealthy a&s;pect, which, on examination, was found to de|pend upon &s;ome di&s;ea&s;e at the juncture of the head with the trunk; and this, on many occa&s;ions, proceeded &s;o far as to cau&s;e a complete &s;eparation, and the head would fall to the ground. It was al&s;o a common ob&s;ervation, that the cabbages which were brought to market, were found damaged about the center: and, further, that &s;ome &s;pecies of cabbages would not form into a head as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>The effects of a peculiar &s;ea&s;on were &s;hewn al&s;o upon different kinds of fruit. It was remarked that cherries did not come to that perfection in which we commonly have them, and that they very &s;oon &s;hewed a di&s;po&s;ition to decay. Early in the &s;ea&s;on the apple-trees were very generally ex|tremely productive, and promi&s;ed a large &s;upply of their fruit in the autumn; but the expectations of the hu&s;bandman on this

head were greatly di&s;appointed: the ap|ples began to fall at lea&s;t a month before the u&s;ual time, and in a very imperfect &s;tate; and tho&s;e which came to maturity could not be kept &s;o long as it is common for them to be pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>In a letter from John Kemp, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> pro|fe&s;&s;or of natural and experimental philo&s;o|phy, &amp;c. &amp;c. in Columbia college, dated April 12th, 1796, it is &s;tated, "that in his ob&s;ervations upon the &s;tate of the atmo&s;|phere during the la&s;t &s;ummer, the mercury in the thermometer was, on an average, three degrees of Farenheit's &s;cale higher than it has been, at the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on, during the ten preceding years; that the moi&s;ture, as indicated by the be&s;t hygrometers, was much greater than u&s;ual; that the quantity of active electricity was &s;o &s;mall, as to be frequently imperceptible by very &s;en&s;ible electrometers, connected with an exploring rod; that the quantity of rain was much greater than u&s;ual, and thunder &s;torms le&s;s

frequent; and that, for the mo&s;t part, the wind was between &s;outh-ea&s;t and north-ea&s;t."</P>
<P>The fir&s;t being e&s;tabli&s;hed, that the &s;tate of the air, during the winter of 1794&mdash;5, and particularly during the &s;ucceeding &s;pring and &s;ummer, has differed very ma|terially from its u&s;ual temperature and di&s;po&s;ition, can there be any good rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned why the di&s;ea&s;es to which our cli|mate is liable in a greater or le&s;s degree, every &s;ea&s;on, &s;hould not receive a <HI>particu|lar character,</HI> or be variou&s;ly modified by a peculiarity of weather? The influence of climate upon the human con&s;titution has been remarked in all ages; and not a year pa&s;&s;es that we do not hear of particu|lar di&s;ea&s;es, being attended with &s;ome un|common appearances, ari&s;ing from pecu|liarity of &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>At a meeting of the Medical Society of the State of New-York, held on the &s;econd Tue&s;day in July, it was remarked by one
<PB N="56" REF="030041_0056_0FE4122D868138E0">
of the members, that he had &s;een &s;everal ca&s;es of angina trachealis, which were attended with anomalous &s;ymptoms, and al&s;o a few ca&s;es of dy&s;entery in adults, which proved ob&s;tinate: and as the&s;e di&s;|ea&s;es were not un&s;ual at that &s;ea&s;on of the year, he concluded that they would become epidemic, or be found the forerunner of one. He was led to this opinion from the hi&s;tory of epidemics; di&s;ea&s;es of that kind being almo&s;t always anticipated by &s;ome particular previous di&s;order: and he fur|ther remarked, that there was &s;omething in the &s;tate of the air which predi&s;po&s;ed to complaints.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time it was ob&s;erved by ano|ther member, that he had al&s;o &s;een &s;everal ca&s;es of angina trachealis, and he found the di&s;ea&s;e attended with le&s;s danger of &s;uf|focation than u&s;ual. Bleeding &s;erved ra|ther as a check to the &s;ymptoms than to af|ford that manife&s;t advantage which is its effect on common occa&s;ions. The di&s;ea&s;e
<PB N="57" REF="030041_0057_0FE412302CFEF390">
yielded to emetics, warm bathing, moderate bleeding, and liberal bowels.</P>
<P>It was further remarked, that febrile complaints had occurred more frequently than u&s;ual at that &s;ea&s;on, and e&s;pecially among children; and that in the u&s;e of an|timonials, the evacuations were extremely bilious in their appearance. From what had been ob&s;erved, therefore, there would remain little doubt that there was &s;ome circum&s;tance in the &s;ea&s;on, which predi&s;|po&s;ed to complaint, and on many occa&s;ions attended with a &s;uperabundance of bile.</P>
<P>Several members of the &s;ociety had met with in&s;tances of cholera, and al&s;o with ob&s;tinate con&s;tipation of the bowels. It was al&s;o noticed, that the diarrhoea and dy&s;entery, to which children are &s;o liable here in the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, and which is &s;ometimes a cau&s;e of great mortality among them, were very rare di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>The Medical Society came to a re&s;olu|tion to be particular in noticing the di&s;ea&s;es
<PB N="58" REF="030041_0058_0FE4123266D68910">
which might take place in the interval be|tween the then pre&s;ent meeting and their next monthly meeting. But the report of a <HI>contagious yellow fever,</HI> which began to prevail in the city about the 25th of July, was a cau&s;e of &s;o much hurry and ha&s;ty declaration of opinions, that a compari&s;on of notes, and a friendly di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of a que&s;tion of &s;o much importance, at the time appointed, was entirely &s;uper&s;eded. But, however widely individuals differed in &s;entiment on this intere&s;ting occa&s;ion, it is but ju&s;tice to mention, that no exer|tions were wanting, on either &s;ide of the que&s;tion, to le&s;&s;en the calamity with which our city was threatened.</P>
<P>If we carefully peru&s;e the hi&s;tory of di&s;ea&s;es, we &s;hall find, that tho&s;e which have proved mo&s;t fatal to the human race, have proceeded, either directly or indi|rectly, from &s;ome acknowledged peculiari|ties of the &s;tate of the air.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="030041_0059_0FE4123455546748">
Of this truth, every author, who has written on epidemic di&s;ea&s;es, bears abun|dant te&s;timony: and notwith&s;tanding that &s;ome countries are more expo&s;ed to changes than others, few have been found altoge|ther exempted. Nor can it be expected, from the nature of things, that the people of North-America, who inhabit a climate which may be &s;aid to participate of all the climates in the world, &s;hould not, in their turn, experience the operation of &s;imilar cau&s;es.</P>
<P>In order the better to under&s;tand why the fever aro&s;e in a particular part of the city, and was more prevalent, as well as malignant, in that part, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to take a general view of the &s;ituation of New-York, and the di&s;po&s;ition of the ground.</P>
<P>New-York is &s;ituated in north latitude forty degrees and an half, longitude &s;even|ty-four degrees we&s;t from the meridian of London. It is built on a &s;outh-we&s;t point
<PB N="60" REF="030041_0060_0FE4123602DD8540">
of land, the highe&s;t elevation of which, above the level of high water mark, is near forty feet, and which is continued, through the city, near a mile lengthways. From this elevation in the original &s;tate of the ground, there was a pretty bold de&s;cent continued, in oppo&s;ite ways, to the water's edge. But it has been the policy of the corporation of this city, at different times, to make <HI>new ground,</HI> as it is called, or to &s;ell to others the privilege of doing &s;o; which has con&s;iderably increa&s;ed the di|men&s;ions of the city, both on the ea&s;t &s;ide, and on the north.</P>
<P>The new made ground is nearly a level, or the de&s;cent is &s;o gradual, that it is drained with difficulty; and we may add, that the level of the new made ground is but very little above the mark of high water. In|deed, it is &s;ometimes entirely overflowed by the &s;pring tides; and from the loo&s;e na|ture of the ground, the water frequently finds its way into the cellars of the hou&s;es
<PB N="61" REF="030041_0061_0FE4123A1BA894E8">
in Front and Water &s;treets, and &s;ometimes even into tho&s;e of Pearl-&s;treet.</P>
<P>The new made ground from Whitehall to Catharine-&s;treet, along the Ea&s;t-river, is, on an average, four hundred feet in breadth, creating, if one may &s;o &s;peak, fifty acres of ground, all of which is built upon. The ground made on the we&s;t &s;ide of the city is about ten acres. The con&s;equences of this mode of extending the city are, no doubt, extremely injurious to the health of the inhabitants; and it is much to be re|gretted, that mea&s;ures are not taken to prevent an increa&s;e of the evil: for we &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;ee, that the late epidemic was rendered particularly malignant and fatal, from cau&s;es ari&s;ing in this plan of inlarging the city. To render this appa|rent, we mu&s;t take a more particular &s;ur|vey of that part of the city where the epi|demic fir&s;t made its appearance.</P>
<P>We &s;hall begin at the river on the ea&s;t &s;ide of Peck-&s;lip: from thence to Water-&s;treet
<PB N="62" REF="030041_0062_0FE4123BDD326550">
the ground is nearly a level: proceed up the &s;lip, and after leaving Water-&s;treet a few paces, the ground a&s;cends until you arrive at Pearl (late Queen) &s;treet: from this to Dover-&s;treet the ground is ri&s;ing, but gradually de&s;cends again as you proceed along Cherry-&s;treet as far as Roo&s;evelt-&s;treet: from this to the New-&s;lip it is nearly a level. The ground at the top of Dover-&s;treet may be con&s;idered as the highe&s;t &s;pot in the range between Peck and the New-&s;lip, by the way of Pearl and Cherry &s;treets, and extending ea&s;t and we&s;t, maintains a general height, which may be computed at fifteen, twelve, ten, &amp;c. feet above the level of Water-&s;treet.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es on the high grounds are prin|cipally three &s;tories high, and built of brick, between which and tho&s;e lowly &s;ituated on the north &s;ide of Water-&s;treet, there is a &s;pace of ground con&s;tituting the different yards of the above hou&s;es, mea&s;uring about one hundred feet.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="030041_0063_0FE4123DD18AD458">
Water-&s;treet, extending from Peck to New-&s;lip, in many places has been rai&s;ed two feet, or more, above the ordinary level of the ground on the north &s;ide of the &s;treet. From tho&s;e grounds to the river there are no drains to convey off the water, &amp;c. which renders an accumulation of filth, in the rear of the hou&s;es upon tho&s;e lots, almo&s;t a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence. Water will frequently become &s;tagnant, and this containing animal and vegetable matters, expo&s;ed to a hot &s;un, mu&s;t prove a fruitful &s;ource of noxious vapours. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, it is natural to expect that tho&s;e who are expo&s;ed to the influence of &s;uch foul air, &s;hould feel its effects, e&s;pe|cially in a &s;tate of predi&s;po&s;ition, ari&s;ing from a peculiar con&s;titution of the air.</P>
<P>The grounds on the &s;outh of Cherry-&s;treet are &s;o arranged, that they are more immediately expo&s;ed to the &s;un; for they may be con&s;idered as on the &s;outh &s;ide of a con&s;iderable hill; and no one is ignorant
<PB N="64" REF="030041_0064_0FE4123F80171DF8">
of the powerful effects which the &s;un pro|duces on a &s;urface of this expo&s;ure.</P>
<P>In a very correct map of this city, by Benjamin Taylor, it will appear, that a line drawn from Whitehall to the bottom of Dover-&s;treet, will run in the direction of north-ea&s;t; and from the bottom of Dover-&s;treet to Corle's-hook, the cour&s;e is nearly ea&s;t. An attention to this fact, al&s;o, is of con&s;equence, if it produces the effect upon the tides it is &s;aid to do, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that of creating different eddies, which furni&s;h a va&s;t quantity of floating, peri&s;hable matter, to the &s;lips in the vicinity of the ground which we have been de&s;cribing.</P>
<P>From this arrangement of the &s;hores along the Ea&s;t-river, the &s;alutary effects of tho&s;e winds which blow during the hot months, from the different points of the compa&s;s, between &s;outh-we&s;t and north-ea&s;t, and which &s;o often afford refre&s;hment to the inhabitants of the elevated &s;ituations, and at the we&s;t end of the town, are little

or not at all experienced by tho&s;e who re|&s;ide at the ea&s;t end: for the air is &s;o chang|ed in its temperature and qualities, before it arrives there, by pa&s;&s;ing over a large part of the city, that it lo&s;es that vivifying principle &s;o e&s;&s;ential to health.</P>
<P>From all the&s;e circum&s;tances it is plainly di&s;coverable, that the &s;outh-ea&s;t part of the city is placed under circum&s;tances not very conducive to the health of its inhabitants; e&s;pecially as a great number of them are of the poorer kind, and in many places very much crouded together in &s;mall con|fined apartments. To &s;trengthen this opi|nion, I will give an extract of a letter from a gentleman of great candour and re&s;pect|ability in the neighbourhood of Dover-&s;treet:&mdash;<Q>Although the docks in the vici|nity of the &s;tore which I occupy may be le&s;s offen&s;ive than in many other parts of the city, yet many of them are in a very exceptionable &s;ituation.

acro&s;s an unfini&s;hed dock, and leaving the vacancy, for &s;everal years, to be filled with every &s;pecies of filth and pe|ri&s;hable matter, is an object worthy the attention of the police. The &s;ituation of the grounds between Water and Cherry &s;treets is rendered very noxious, by Water-&s;treet being rai&s;ed above a certain level, and thus preventing tho&s;e grounds from being drained. The effect of &s;uch a nui&s;ance on the health of the inhabitants of a crouded part of the city cannot be imaginary.</Q></P>
<P>It is not to be under&s;tood, that the lati|tude of a place is always to determine its temperature; nor is it uniform in giving a &s;imilar character to the di&s;ea&s;es mo&s;t pre|valent under a &s;imilar parallel. Local cir|cum&s;tances will have a much more power|ful operation, and, in general, are found to produce the characteri&s;tic di&s;tinctions which exi&s;t between the prevalent di&s;ea&s;es

<P>The country bordering upon the &s;ea|coa&s;t, from the Province of Main to the Never&s;ink, or Highlands of Shrew&s;bury, is rough and irregular, and almo&s;t every where covered with hardy oaks and hick|ories; and the &s;oil is generally as irregular as the face of the country.

<P>The nearne&s;s of New-York to the &s;ea, the ready acce&s;s which the tides have to its harbour, and the elevation and boldne&s;s of the &s;hores, mu&s;t doubtle&s;s be a great &s;ecu|rity to the health of the inhabitants.

The principal cities are mo&s;tly &s;ituated at a di&s;tance from the &s;ea, and on the margin of &s;ome river, the navigable waters of which are a mixture of fre&s;h and &s;alt water; and the fre&s;hets which take place in tho&s;e rivers, at particular &s;ea&s;ons of the year, often overflow their banks, and have, no doubt, a con&s;iderable agency in produc|ing the epidemic di&s;ea&s;es which &s;o often prevail in tho&s;e climates, of which Doctor Jack&s;on has given a very particular and intere&s;ting de&s;cription. <Q>We learn from experience (&s;ays the Doctor) that fe|vers are little known in rough and hilly countries, where waters flow with a rapid

that the &s;ickne&s;s never begins till the heats have continued &s;o long as to give time for putrefaction, and evaporation of the water; the commencement, therefore, of the epi|demics, may be dated from &s;ome time in July, or the beginning of Augu&s;t, under the canicular heats; their &s;en&s;ible decline about the falling of the leaf; and end when the fro&s;t begins."</P>
<P>Speaking of the garri&s;on of Ghent, he ob&s;erves,&mdash;"The battalion of the guards was a remarkable in&s;tance of the difference of quarters: two of its companies were &s;ta|tioned on St. Peter's hill; the remaining eight in the lower part of the town, in rooms &s;o very damp, that the men could hardly keep their &s;hoes and belts from moulding. In the month of July, the &s;ick of this one battalion amounted to about one hundred and forty; of which number only two men belonged to the companies on the hill, and all the re&s;t to tho&s;e in the lower town. But in the middle of Augu&s;t,

upon changing the barracks, the &s;ickne&s;s &s;uddenly abated."</P>
<P>Can any thing &s;hew more &s;atisfactorily than this &s;hort de&s;cription of Sir John Prin|gle, the unfailing influence of &s;ituations in determining the extent of di&s;ea&s;es under particular con&s;titutions of the atmo&s;phere?

<P>It is a fact, then, well e&s;tabli&s;hed, that while an epidemic has raged among the inhabitants of flat and low &s;ituations, tho&s;e who have lived on high grounds, in the neighbourhood, have not, in the &s;malle&s;t degree, felt its influence: but they need only de&s;cend to the low ground, and they

will there &s;icken in common with the in|habitants.</P>
<P>If the preceding circum&s;tances are con|&s;idered, they afford a &s;ufficient explanation why the effects of the late epidemic were &s;o partially felt by the inhabitants of this city.</P>
<P>It will be proper to remark here, that the epidemic of la&s;t year is not a new di&s;|ea&s;e. It is e&s;tabli&s;hed upon re&s;pectable authority, that a di&s;order, in every re&s;pect &s;imilar to the one which made its appear|ance in this city in July la&s;t, and in one in&s;tance attended with the &s;ymptom of black vomiting, occurred in Water-&s;treet, in the neighbourhood of Dover-&s;treet, four or five years ago, and more or le&s;s every year &s;ince; and was particularly confined to that part of the city: but being unaided by a particular &s;tate of the air, and under the influence, perhaps, of exciting cau&s;es of a le&s;s active nature, it was neither &s;o ge|nerally felt, nor &s;o fatal in its operation.</P>
<P>Agreeably to this opinion is the declara|tion

contained in a letter we before have had occa&s;ion to quote; the author of which ob&s;erves,&mdash;<Q>I am convinced that the di&s;|order has originated from local cau&s;es, becau&s;e it has appeared in this quarter of the city, at the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on, for &s;everal years pa&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>Nor has this di&s;ea&s;e been confined to New-York. It is a fact beyond contro|ver&s;y, that during the warmer parts of the year 1795, a fever, in all e&s;&s;ential circum|&s;tances re&s;embling the epidemic of this place, appeared in many places in this &s;tate and in the &s;tate of Connecticut. The &s;ame cau&s;es, we &s;hould naturally expect, would produce &s;imilar effects.

animal and vegetable matters, in low and damp &s;ituations, were a frequent cau&s;e of bilious remitting fever.</P>
<P>In confirmation of this truth, we are fortunate in being enabled to pre&s;ent our readers with the following intere&s;ting communication from Doctor Williams.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Philadelphia,</HI> <DATE>19<HI>th Dec.</HI> 1795.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>As near as I can recollect, there are at Whitehall, formerly called Skeen&s;bo|rough, about two hundred and eighty fa|milies; out of which, and tran&s;ient per|&s;ons, there died, from the fir&s;t of July to the la&s;t of October, about twenty of a bilious fever.</P>
<P>In the town of Hampton, which lies &s;outh-ea&s;t, and adjoining Whitehall, containing about one hundred families, five died of bilious fever. In We&s;tfield and Greenfield about twenty-four died, two thirds of a bilious fever.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="030041_0078_0FE412609428CFF8">
That part of the town of Whitehall where the deaths in general happened, is by the &s;ide of Wood-Creek, where there are low mar&s;hy grounds and dead waters. New comers to this place are commonly attacked with bilious or inter|mittent fevers. But the la&s;t year, by rea&s;on of continued hot and dry weather &s;ucceeding an uncommon wet &s;pring, &s;ome of the old &s;ettlers were likewi&s;e attacked with the&s;e complaints.</P>
<P>It was ob&s;erved that the lowne&s;s of the waters had expo&s;ed, more than common, dead vegetable matter to the action of the &s;un; and thus the exhalations did not con&s;i&s;t of watery vapours only, but of a putrid effluvia, ari&s;ing from the decom|po&s;ition of dead vegetable matter, and innumerable in&s;ects, which are always found in &s;uch &s;ituations.</P>
<P>About the year 1788, at the town of Hebern, &s;outh and adjoining Grenville, a mill was erected on a dead creek. The
<PB N="79" REF="030041_0079_0FE412628874FA60">
waters in con&s;equence &s;pread over the flat grounds for near three miles in length. This cau&s;ed, in the hot &s;ea&s;ons, a fourth of the inhabitants adjoining this water, to be attacked with bilious fever.</P>
<P>About &s;ix years &s;ince, in the town of Argyle, an ob&s;truction of water was cau&s;ed as above, &s;o that three hundred acres of land were overflowed. This oc|ca&s;ioned, the fir&s;t year, &s;light bilious and intermitting fevers. The &s;econd year, when part of the land before covered with water became dry, and was expo&s;ed to the &s;un, the complaints became putrid in their tendency, and numbers died. The ob|&s;truction, the following winter, was re|moved, and the place again became heal|thy, and &s;o remains.</P>
<P>It is to be remarked, that the la&s;t &s;um|mer produced more &s;ickne&s;s than was ever known in that country, except in the year 1788; when, at the latter part of July, there happened a great flood, which
<PB N="80" REF="030041_0080_0FE412644F595240">
was followed by a great drought. The heat of la&s;t &s;ummer was acknowledged by all to have been much greater than in former &s;ea&s;ons. The water of Saratoga lake, in Saratoga county, was very low, and the colour exceeding green.</P>
<P>From Lan&s;ingburgh, northerly, along the banks of the river Hud&s;on, the in|habitants were generally attacked with bilious fever; mo&s;t of which, without timely care, became putrid. At Schoch|ticook, a town about a mile to the ea&s;t of Hud&s;on river, and upon the banks of Ho|&s;ack river, heretofore healthy, the inha|bitants were generally attacked with bi|lious fever, and &s;ome died.</P>
<P>Although I have attended numbers, and frequently remained days and nights with the &s;ick, I never felt any bad effects from it. But I have ob&s;erved, that, if the nur&s;es came from &s;ituations not &s;o much expo&s;ed to bilious complaints, it was not uncommon for them to be taken &s;ick.</P>

The exi&s;tence of a bilious remittent fever, re&s;embling the late epidemic of this place, at a di&s;tance from the city, is further confirmed by the te&s;timony of a gentleman, of high e&s;timation, and exten&s;ive practice in his profe&s;&s;ion, in the city of Hartford, in the &s;tate of Connecticut, who writes, in a letter to Doctor Wright Po&s;t, dated January 12th, 1796, as follows:&mdash;</P>
<Q><P>This epidemic (the dy&s;entery) was by no means a partial one; it &s;pread over the whole city, and continued until about the beginning of October, when it gave way to the introduction of the bilious re|mittent, which has, as yet, &s;carcely left us, though for a month or &s;ix weeks pa&s;t, the ca&s;es have been few and trifling. This, although not &s;o prevalent as the dy&s;entery, &s;pread over particular parts of the town, and many of the ca&s;es were ob&s;tinate and lengthy.</P>
<P>The weather, e&s;pecially in Augu&s;t and September, while the dy&s;entery prevailed,
<PB N="82" REF="030041_0082_0FE41269B4381E48">
was very &s;ingular, &s;uch as is without a &s;imilar in&s;tance in the recollection of the olde&s;t per&s;ons; I mean particularly as it re&s;pected the <HI>deluging rains,</HI> which fell &s;o frequently in the cour&s;e of the&s;e two months. Every two or three days, a fall of rain, which generally la&s;ted about &s;ix hours, would deluge the whole coun|try; in&s;omuch that mo&s;t of the vegeta|bles, plants, gra&s;s, &amp;c. in the vallies, where vegetation was much the mo&s;t rapid, were killed and &s;wept away, or re|mained among &s;tagnant waters. In many places the air became highly offen&s;ive, and wholly unfit for re&s;piration. The&s;e heavy rains were &s;ucceeded, almo&s;t without an exception, by uncommonly hot &s;uns; hence the whole atmo&s;phere was impregnated with exhalations, from putrid vegetables, and more e&s;pecially in the neighbourhood of rivers and vallies.</P>
<P>The effect of local &s;ituation was par|ticularly ob&s;ervable in this place; I mean
<PB N="83" REF="030041_0083_0FE4126BAA72BEB8">
as it re&s;pects the bilious remittent. Between our front &s;treet and the river, a di&s;tance of about forty rods, the ground is much lower than on each &s;ide. This extends about half a mile in length, with &s;everal interruptions, by &s;treets being built acro&s;s it. It was about this place, and on the banks of a little river which runs through a part of the town, that this di&s;ea&s;e was mo&s;tly confined; <HI>and this I find was generally the ca&s;e in the mo&s;t &s;ickly parts of the &s;tate.</HI></P>
<P>I will relate to you the &s;ituation of one family, which was the mo&s;t remarkable of the whole. Some time in the month of September, I was called to vi&s;it a young man, about eighteen years old, in a fami|ly in the &s;kirts of this town. He was violently attacked with mo&s;t of the cha|racteri&s;tic &s;ymptoms of the yellow fever, as de&s;cribed by Ru&s;h. The next day a &s;econd was taken in the &s;ame manner; and on the morning of the third day,
<PB N="84" REF="030041_0084_0FE4126D57398E80">
three more were taken &s;ick. This led me to &s;u&s;pect &s;ome particular cau&s;e. I &s;earched for it in vain at that time. The next morning, on pa&s;&s;ing through the kitchen, I &s;melt &s;omething that was very offen&s;ive, which none of the family had noticed. On opening the cellar-door, I found that it proceeded from the cellar. Two per&s;ons went down to examine, and found in one corner of a &s;mall tight room, a quantity of June cabbages, on which the &s;un had &s;hone about three hours in the day. They had rotted, and &s;unk down into a lump of putrefaction. They run a &s;tick under them, and lifted them up, and there immediately i&s;&s;ued &s;uch an intolerable &s;tench, as obliged them in&s;tantly to leave the cellar. A vomiting was brought on at once, which la&s;ted them nearly an hour. Notwith|&s;tanding that the doors and windows of the cellar were thrown open, it was two days before they could clear it out. No
<PB N="85" REF="030041_0085_0FE41270ACAA99D0">
other per&s;on in the family was taken afterwards, and tho&s;e who were already &s;eized, all recovered.</P>
<P>Here was the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e, excited by the &s;ame cau&s;e which produces it el&s;e|where, and that cau&s;e detected. Why may we not &s;uppo&s;e, that if this circum|&s;tance had taken place in a thickly inha|bited neighbourhood, prepared by predi&s;|po&s;ition, and aided by all tho&s;e cau&s;es which generally exi&s;t during the hot &s;ea|&s;on, in populous places, that it would have &s;pread with the &s;ame rapidity it did in New-York or in Philadelphia? I confe&s;s the conjecture appears to me a rational one, and ought, at lea&s;t, to ex|cite our attention.</P></Q>
<P>We cannot forbear to remark on the facts contained in the above letters, how analogous the circum&s;tances were, under which the bilious fever aro&s;e in different parts of the country: and by comparing the&s;e facts, more e&s;pecially as they relate
<PB N="86" REF="030041_0086_0FE412725A17AC18">
to the city of Hartford, with what hap|pened in this place, we &s;ee a very &s;trong analogy indeed. Now, were it nece&s;&s;ary to inlarge any further upon the &s;ubject of imported contagion, we might, with great propriety, adduce the exi&s;tence and preva|lence of a fever at Hartford, and e&s;pecial|ly in the family &s;o particularly mentioned, the &s;ame as our late epidemic, which no one ever entertained a &s;u&s;picion to have ari&s;en from any cau&s;es than tho&s;e <HI>perfect|ly local.</HI></P>
<P>It would be difficult to a&s;certain with accuracy, what proportion the different de&s;criptions of people bear to one another, who were attacked with the late epidemic fever. It may be taken for granted, how|ever, upon the te&s;timony of tho&s;e who&s;e opportunities be&s;t enabled them to judge, that the number that were taken &s;ick, living on the new made ground, particu|larly at the &s;outh &s;ide of the city, and in other low places, compared with tho&s;e
<PB N="87" REF="030041_0087_0FE412744DD3BBE0">
re&s;iding in more elevated &s;ituations, may be computed as twenty to one; and if we were to make a calculation of the number of inhabitants who died, compared with vi&s;itors, or tran&s;ient per&s;ons, we might &s;ay five of the latter to one of the former.</P>
<P>This di&s;proportion may be accounted for: fir&s;tly; vi&s;itors, e&s;pecially tho&s;e from the northward, where the air is generally purer, are more &s;u&s;ceptible of an epidemic influence than the inhabitants, who are accu&s;tomed to the circum&s;tances of their &s;ituation: for there cannot remain a doubt, that the human con&s;titution acquires, by habit, the power of re&s;i&s;ting, to a certain degree, the effects of tho&s;e cau&s;es which have a tendency to produce di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>We find this fact particularly noticed by mo&s;t writers on the bilious or yellow fever, which &s;o commonly makes its appearance on board the &s;hipping in the different har|bours in the We&s;t-Indies. It is de&s;cribed as mo&s;t fatal to tho&s;e lately from the north|ern
<PB N="88" REF="030041_0088_0FE412ABD48BAC90">
latitudes. So, in New-York, the fir&s;t appearance of the fever was on board the &s;hip William, from Liverpool, the 25th of July, four of who&s;e crew died. On the 26th of July the fever appeared in the &s;hip Connecticut, from Liverpool: &s;he al&s;o lo&s;t four of her men. The&s;e ve&s;&s;els, it mu&s;t be remarked, laid at the wharfs in front of that part of Water-&s;treet, where the di&s;|ea&s;e fir&s;t appeared among the inhabitants. Their men, without doubt, were frequently on &s;hore, and having lately arrived, were more &s;u&s;ceptible of the cau&s;es producing the fever, than the re&s;idents of that &s;ituation, who had become gradually habituated to its action.</P>
<P>The men of many other ve&s;&s;els from the northward, which were &s;tationed at different wharfs in the ea&s;t river, felt more or le&s;s the effects of the epidemic influ|ence: whereas the crews of tho&s;e ve&s;|&s;els which arrived during the &s;ummer months from the We&s;t-Indies, and other
<PB N="89" REF="030041_0089_0FE4127DC54D25B0">
warm latitudes, all remained well; and &s;uch individuals among them as had been &s;ick on their pa&s;&s;age, recovered very &s;oon after their arrival in this harbour.</P>
<P>Secondly; of the vi&s;itors who were &s;eiz|ed with the epidemic fever, a great propor|tion were emigrants from England, Ireland and Scotland; and they were more expo&s;ed to its effects from the very crouded and confined &s;ituations in which they were unavoidably placed.</P>
<P>The mi&s;erable condition of that cla&s;s of unfortunate people, is well &s;hown in a candid and very intere&s;ting communica|tion from the Rev. Mr. O'Brien, pa&s;tor to the Catholic congregation in this city, from which the following is an extract:&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>As &s;oon as the above cau&s;es had pro|duced their malignant effects in the part of the city which was previou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed to receive them, I was con&s;tantly employed, in&s;omuch that I might with &s;ome truth &s;ay, that I lived in the centre of the di&s;ea&s;e;
<PB N="90" REF="030041_0090_0FE4127FB26CC870">
and for nearly two months, never laid in bed one whole night. I found in mo&s;t pla|ces, a total want of every nece&s;&s;ary of life. Numbers of poor &s;ufferers, confined in &s;ubterraneous apartments, which admit|ted no light, but from their hatch-doors; &s;o that when &s;hut down at night, it might literally be &s;aid of them that they were buried alive. In the progre&s;s of vi&s;iting the &s;ick, I was much di&s;gu&s;ted at the abo|minable, uncleanly &s;tate of their mi&s;era|ble habitations, and a total want of ne|ce&s;&s;aries: for in mo&s;t places, they had not even a &s;tool to &s;it on, nor a bed to lie upon. On inquiry, I found the much greater part of them to be emigrants of that very &s;ummer; in&s;omuch that out of four hundred and &s;ixty-two of my con|gregation, who &s;unk under the di&s;order, nineteen twentieths were totally un|known to me.</Q></P>
<P>To this deplorable condition of the poor emigrants who arrived in this city during
<PB N="91" REF="030041_0091_0FE4128161109598">
the prevalence of the epidemic fever, is to be a&s;cribed, humanly &s;peaking, the ex|tent of its mortality. It is a circum&s;tance, moreover, well known to many, that numbers of them were obliged to remain on board &s;hip for &s;ome time after their ar|rival in this port, as well from their want of means to procure comfortable lodgings, as from the very crouded &s;tate of the city; and at la&s;t they exchanged their confined holds for tho&s;e &s;ubterraneous apartments which have ju&s;t been &s;o emphatically de|&s;cribed by Mr. O'Brien. This may account for the fact, that out of nearly eight hun|dred per&s;ons who died, not more than one hundred and fifty were citizens of New-York; and of this number but a &s;mall pro|portion until the di&s;ea&s;e had prevailed a con&s;iderable time, perhaps one half during the la&s;t four weeks.</P>
<P>If the above &s;tatement be true, what a le&s;&s;on does it convey, as well to the peo|ple as to the magi&s;tracy! Ought it not

<P>I &s;hall now di&s;mi&s;s this part of the &s;ubject, in order to lay before my readers the &s;ymptoms which &s;erved to character|ize the fever in que&s;tion, as far as they came under my ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t and the mo&s;t con&s;tant of the&s;e, as well as the mo&s;t &s;evere, was a pain ordi|narily fixed in the fore part of the head; and this was u&s;ually attended with a dif|fu&s;ed redne&s;s of the eyes, and a pain in the back. The&s;e &s;ymptoms have been known to exi&s;t, in a moderate degree, &s;eve|ral days previous to the attack of fever.</P>
<P>A &s;en&s;e of coldne&s;s did not always take place at the beginning of the fever; and
<PB N="93" REF="030041_0093_0FE4128638A6DE60">
much le&s;s frequently was any thing like rigors experienced. The lo&s;s of &s;trength, al&s;o, in the beginning, was very variable. Many did not complain of any particular weakne&s;s; whil&s;t others felt &s;o great a degree of pro&s;tration, as to be unable to &s;upport them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The patients &s;ometimes complained of a general &s;orene&s;s of the mu&s;cles, and particularly tho&s;e of the thighs and legs; and in &s;ome this affection continued a trou|ble&s;ome &s;ymptom.</P>
<P>It did not frequently happen that the &s;tomach was much affected at the com|mencement of the di&s;ea&s;e; yet in&s;tances occurred where the fever was u&s;hered in with great &s;ickne&s;s, frequent retchings to vomit, oppre&s;&s;ion and pain about the prae|cordia, with exce&s;&s;ive anxiety and re&s;tle&s;&s;|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>The tongue often at fir&s;t appeared na|tural, but it mo&s;t commonly looked white. After the fever had continued &s;ome days,
<PB N="94" REF="030041_0094_0FE412882EC7EBF0">
the matter collected upon its &s;urface, a&s;|&s;umed a brown colour, but continued moi&s;t. At length it became dark, &s;ometimes black, dry, and rough.</P>
<P>The pul&s;e was generally frequent at the beginning of the fever, but varied, as to fulne&s;s and &s;trength, according to the ha|bit and con&s;titution of the patient. It &s;ometimes happened, after the fever had made con&s;iderable progre&s;s, that the pul&s;e remitted, and was commonly a &s;ymptom of great danger. A rare pul&s;e, al&s;o, was in &s;ome in&s;tances met with. In a boy who had had the fever &s;ix or &s;even days, and in whom the number of pul&s;ations in a minute had been, for the mo&s;t part, about one hundred and twenty, the fre|quency was &s;uddenly dimini&s;hed, and did not exceed fifty-five &s;trokes in a minute. In this &s;tate they continued, with very little variation, for two days, while the pa|tient appeared to be getting well. The pul&s;e then &s;uddenly became as frequent
<PB N="95" REF="030041_0095_0FE41289DBBAD0E0">
as before, and two days after the acce&s;&s;ion, he died. It happened al&s;o in the in&s;tance of a gentleman, who&s;e attack was very violent; who&s;e pul&s;e was frequent, full, and &s;trong, and who had been freely and repeatedly bled; that after eight days, the number of pul&s;ations were reduced be|low the u&s;ual &s;tandard, and &s;eemed to be attended with a general change for the better. The&s;e appearances; however, were fallacious: a recurrence of violent &s;ymptoms &s;oon put a fatal termination to the di&s;ea&s;e. The &s;ame circum&s;tance we find taken notice of by Doctor Hunter and others.</P>
<P>Yellowne&s;s of the &s;kin was by no means a con&s;tant concomitant of the di&s;ea&s;e. Sometimes it appeared partially about the face and neck; at other times a little tinge of the eyes was the only yellowne&s;s to be ob&s;erved. In &s;ome in&s;tances it made its appearance about the third day, but more commonly not until the fifth, &s;ixth, or &s;e|venth
<PB N="96" REF="030041_0096_0FE4128D8CBF9878">
day. When it came on early, it was generally attended with violent &s;ymp|toms, and denoted danger: and yet pa|tients recovered, who&s;e &s;kin was univer|&s;ally as yellow as &s;affron.</P>
<P>The temperature of the &s;kin varied very con&s;iderably. In &s;ome ca&s;es it was hot and dry, and communicated a very di&s;a|greeable &s;en&s;ation to the touch. In others it was moi&s;t and cool from the fir&s;t attack, and continued &s;o during the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Although the fever frequently ran high, it was &s;eldom attended with much thir&s;t; except in &s;ome few ca&s;es, where it was difficult to &s;atisfy the demands of the &s;ick for drink.</P>
<P>When the pain in the head was very con&s;iderable, the eyes were commonly a good deal inflamed, &s;uffu&s;ed with tears, and very impatient of light: and it now and then happened, that the patients com|plained of a &s;en&s;ation, as if the eyes were endeavouring to e&s;cape from the &s;ockets.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="030041_0097_0FE4128F39C3B458">
The re&s;piration was &s;eldom much af|fected at the beginning. On &s;ome occa|&s;ions, however, it was difficult, attended with a &s;en&s;e of fulne&s;s in the che&s;t, which was &s;ometimes a cau&s;e of great anxiety, and frequent deep &s;ighing. Doctor Hunter ob&s;erves, that <Q>there is no difficulty in di&s;tingui&s;hing tho&s;e &s;ymptoms from la|borious re&s;piration, that depends upon a local affection of the lungs. In the lat|ter the difficulty of breathing is uniform; whereas, in the former, both the expira|tions and in&s;pirations will, for two or three times, be natural and ea&s;y, and immediately after become laborious and unequal, and &s;o on, alternately.</Q></P>
<P>The urine, in general, underwent very little change. It was &s;ometimes a little increa&s;ed in quantity, and at other times ra|ther dimini&s;hed. But in tho&s;e ca&s;es where the &s;kin became yellow, the urine put on that dark brown appearance which is com|mon
<PB N="98" REF="030041_0098_0FE4129130E2D0F8">
in diffu&s;ions of bile. In &s;ome in|&s;tances of black vomiting, and in two or three ca&s;es, previous to the occurrence of that &s;ymptom, the urine became exceed|ingly turbid, and depo&s;ited a dark coloured matter.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the ordinary train of &s;ymp|toms, which attended the fever, we have endeavoured to de&s;cribe; and though in particular ca&s;es, no doubt, &s;ome deviations might be noticed, yet it is believed there were none which could be thought to af|fect e&s;&s;entially the character of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>In the treatment of the late epidemic fever, my fir&s;t care was to have the pa|tient placed in a room as large, and well ventilated as po&s;&s;ible. The advantages ari&s;ing from an attention to this part of practice, mu&s;t appear obvious to all who reflect, that while a cau&s;e which may have produced a di&s;ea&s;e continues to act, or while circum&s;tances exi&s;t, which tend very much to aggravate the &s;ymptoms, the
<PB N="99" REF="030041_0099_0FE41292DD51EBA0">
efficacy of our remedies is rendered, if not of no avail, at lea&s;t extremely doubtful.</P>
<P>When the patient was placed in a &s;itua|tion as eligible as could be procured, the leading object was to evacuate the &s;tomach and bowels. If this important point could be effected at the fir&s;t attack, it was often found to cut &s;hort the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e: and when it did not do this, it for the mo&s;t part rendered the &s;ub&s;equent &s;ymptoms &s;o moderate, that they more readily yielded to the means of art.</P>
<P>In general it was not thought of much con&s;equence, what purgative medicine was u&s;ed, except in in&s;tances where the &s;tomach &s;hewed &s;igns of particular di&s;or|der. A &s;olution of &s;alts and manna, in &s;uch do&s;es as circum&s;tances &s;eemed to in|dicate, was very commonly pre&s;cribed. In mo&s;t ca&s;es it &s;at ea&s;y upon the &s;to|mach; and even when the fir&s;t do&s;es were rejected, by per&s;evering in its u&s;e, in final|ly pa&s;&s;ed downwards, and, upon the whole,
<PB N="100" REF="030041_0100_0FE4129699EF9E30">
was found to operate with more certainty and effect, than any other medicine.</P>
<P>The bowels being emptied, with &s;alts and manna, it was thought expedient to continue the evacuation in a moderate degree; and for this purpo&s;e, a &s;olution of manna and cream of tartar was employed, &s;o as to produce its effect three or four times a day. This was a favourite medi|cine. It was found not di&s;agreeable to take, and generally remained upon the &s;tomach, without producing any &s;ickne&s;s, or other unea&s;ine&s;s. When the di&s;ea&s;e was extended beyond the &s;ixth or &s;eventh day, and purgatives were indicated, there was a manife&s;t advantage derived from equal parts of rhubarb and magne&s;ia, in mint-water, over any other medicine, given in &s;mall and repeated do&s;es; or a &s;trong watery infu&s;ion of rhubarb, with the addition of a little manna, and &s;p. lavend. comp. to render it agreeable to the ta&s;te. The&s;e medicines an&s;wered the pur|po&s;e
<PB N="101" REF="030041_0101_0FE4129846647D68">
of gentle aperients, whil&s;t they in|duced no debility by their operation.</P>
<P>If jalap and calomel were pre&s;cribed at the beginning of the complaint, it was &s;eldom thought nece&s;&s;ary to repeat them. To pre&s;erve the bowels &s;oluble, a &s;olution of manna and cream of tartar was found better to an&s;wer the intention.</P>
<P>When a di&s;ordered &s;tomach did not ap|pear among the primary affections, but, on attempting the u&s;e of purgatives, they were thrown up again, a few grains of ipecacu|anha, with a free u&s;e of camomile tea, has &s;ometimes emptied the &s;tomach to advan|tage. After allowing the &s;tomach to re&s;t a few hours, purgatives could then be employed with the u&s;ual &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>A di&s;ordered &s;tomach, with frequent retchings and efforts to vomit, was now and then met with at the beginning of the fever, and &s;ometimes, with other matters thrown up, there was an appearance of bile. Gly&s;ters, frequently repeated, very
<PB N="102" REF="030041_0102_0FE41299EE0A02C0">
commonly moderated this &s;ymptom. Oc|ca&s;ionally an infu&s;ion of camomile, or, where the patient preferred it, warm wa|ter, was u&s;ed to clean&s;e the &s;tomach; and as &s;oon as there was a probability that the &s;tomach would retain it, recour&s;e was had to the purgative &s;olution.</P>
<P>When a &s;en&s;e of weight and oppre&s;&s;ion at the &s;tomach, a tenderne&s;s or &s;orene&s;s of the praecordia upon pre&s;&s;ure, a vomiting of a bilious matter, of a dark poracious appearance, extreme re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, a dejec|tion of &s;pirits, were met with among the primary &s;ymptoms, the ca&s;e wore an a|larming a&s;pect, and called for the utmo&s;t &s;kill and exertions of the phy&s;ician. To allay the vomiting, frequent gly&s;ters, and the application of a bli&s;ter to the region of the &s;tomach, were found mo&s;t effectu|al; and to the&s;e was added the occa&s;ional u&s;e of efferve&s;cing draughts. If this me|thod did not &s;ucceed, the feet and legs were wrapt in large flannel cloths, wrung very
<PB N="103" REF="030041_0103_0FE4129BF42E2780">
dry out of hot water. This expedient, by relaxing the ve&s;&s;els on the &s;urface, and in|ducing per&s;piration, &s;ometimes relieved the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ymptoms ju&s;t enumerated.</P>
<P>When the vomiting could not be &s;ub|dued, the patient at length threw up a dark coloured matter, re&s;embling the grounds of coffee, and &s;ometimes little dark coloured flakes were found mixed with it. To this affection of the &s;tomach, &s;ucceeded coldne&s;s of the extremities, with a livid appearance of the hands and feet, intermitting pul&s;e, exce&s;&s;ive anxiety, op|pre&s;&s;ion about the region of the &s;tomach, and hiccough, with difficult and laborious re&s;piration. The&s;e &s;ymptoms continuing in a high degree, commonly indicated the near approach of death, which was &s;eldom protracted to more than two or three days. I am happy to add, however, that there were not wanting in&s;tances of the recovery of per&s;ons who had laboured under black vomiting, accompanied with all the di&s;tre&s;|&s;ing
<PB N="104" REF="030041_0104_0FE412A16ACC8330">
&s;ymptoms peculiar to this &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>It likewi&s;e happened during the pro|gre&s;s of the foregoing &s;ymptoms, but at no certain period, that a haemorrhage took place from the no&s;e, mouth, or gums, and &s;ometimes from all three &s;ources at once. In one in&s;tance, a friend of mine inform|ed me, that the blood trickled from the in|ternal parts of the ears. But in the cour&s;e of my vi&s;iting the &s;ick, I &s;eldom met with con&s;iderable haemorrhages, that the ap|plication of ice to the bleeding ve&s;&s;els, or to the neighbouring parts, did not mo&s;t certainly check the di&s;charge.</P>
<P>The &s;evere train of &s;ymptoms above enumerated, according to my ob&s;ervation, generally occurred in what might be called the &s;econd &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e, and &s;ome|times after a free u&s;e had been made of the lancet.</P>
<P>At the fir&s;t of my attendance upon the epidemic fever, I was impre&s;&s;ed with an
<PB N="105" REF="030041_0105_0FE412A31A8809B8">
idea that an early recour&s;e to the bark was e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;ucce&s;sful treat|ment of it. Under the influence of this opinion, after the contents of the &s;tomach and bowels were carried off, I directed the bark to be u&s;ed, either in powder, decoction, or the cold infu&s;ion, as circum&s;tances ap|peared to indicate. In every in&s;tance it was found to di&s;agree with the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages. In &s;ome it occa&s;ioned a fulne&s;s and &s;traightne&s;s about the praecordia: in others it offended the inte&s;tines, producing a fulne&s;s and &s;ore|ne&s;s in the abdomen: whil&s;t in others it excited the &s;y&s;tem, increa&s;ed the head-ach, and brought on an acce&s;&s;ion of fever. Nor did I ever &s;ee the bark do good, <HI>until an entire &s;olution of the di&s;ea&s;e took place.</HI> That it might not have been beneficial, I &s;hall not a&s;&s;ert. If, however, an opportunity of a &s;imilar kind unfortunately occurs, I &s;hall pre&s;cribe it, under particular circum|&s;tances, in a manner very different from that in which I have before u&s;ed it.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="030041_0106_0FE412A50DB65488">
The bad effects of the bark, which &s;o invariably followed the u&s;e of it, under my direction, were commonly removed by the u&s;e of purgatives. Whil&s;t the pa|tient was taking laxative medicines, I made it a common practice to give freely of &s;p. minderer. and evidently with good effects.</P>
<P>If the heat and fever were con&s;iderable, and the &s;tomach retentive, &s;mall do&s;es of antimonials, particularly James's powder, &s;ometimes joined with camphor, were found u&s;eful. The &s;p. minderer. al&s;o, was a u&s;eful medicine in this &s;tate of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The diaphore&s;is which it commonly in|duced afforded great relief, and general|ly brought on a remi&s;&s;ion, if not an in|termi&s;&s;ion of the fever. When a free per&s;piration took place on the &s;econd or third day, it was con&s;idered as a favoura|ble event, and denoted a happy termina|tion of the di&s;ea&s;e. But &s;weating did not
<PB N="107" REF="030041_0107_0FE412A6B606CB98">
always prove &s;erviceable. In&s;tances hap|pened, where this evacuation was pro|fu&s;e from the fir&s;t attack, without &s;eeming to benefit the patient in any degree. When it came on thus early, the tempera|ture of the &s;kin generally, and particularly of the extreme parts, was &s;o altered as to communicate a con&s;iderable &s;en&s;e of cold to the touch.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to calomel, which many have pre&s;cribed with that freedom and con&s;tancy, as if it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;pecific qualities, I can &s;ay little from my own ex|perience. I never could induce my mind to believe that it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed any advantages over many other purgatives; and from the account given of its effects by &s;ome of my friends, I am di&s;po&s;ed to favour a be|lief that its operation, as a purgative, was <HI>very limited.</HI> It produced frequent &s;tools, but the quantity di&s;charged was very &s;mall; and during the u&s;e of it, the patient fre|quently complained of a &s;en&s;e of fulne&s;s
<PB N="108" REF="030041_0108_0FE412AA27E83F60">
and con&s;triction in different regions of the abdomen. The&s;e feelings were commonly &s;oon relieved by the more copious evacua|tions procured by either of the purgative &s;olutions before mentioned. That calomel has nothing &s;pecific in its nature, &s;eems pretty clearly evinced by tho&s;e ca&s;es in which it has been taken as a preventive. In&s;tances of this &s;ort were not unfrequent during the prevalence of the late epidemic in this city. But the fever was known to attack per&s;ons under the influence of this medicine; while others, who did not take mercury, and were living preci&s;ely under the &s;ame circum&s;tances, have e&s;caped the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Three per&s;ons out of four, of the &s;ame family, had taken mercury for &s;ome time, with a view to guard them&s;elves again&s;t the fever; but they were, notwith&s;tanding, &s;eized with the epidemic. In one, a &s;ali|vation had been produced, and in this &s;ituation, he was attacked with fever.
<PB N="109" REF="030041_0109_0FE4127BD8D48D58">
As &s;oon as the fever came on, from a conviction that the mercury had not been of any &s;ervice to him, he omitted the u&s;e of it, and with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of mild pur|gatives, &s;oon got well. The fourth per|&s;on, who had not taken any calomel, and who nur&s;ed the other three, e&s;caped the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>A number of other in&s;tances might be mentioned, in which calomel had been taken as a preventive, where the per&s;ons, notwith&s;tanding, took the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>In the management of the late epidemic, the cold bath was frequently re&s;orted to. As a general application, I can &s;ay no|thing of it from my own ob&s;ervation. I have been, indeed, in the habit of wa&s;hing the hands, arms, face, neck, and brea&s;t, with cold vinegar and water, in ca&s;es of fever, and always found it a very grateful refre&s;hment to the patient. I according|ly employed it freely, and as exten&s;ively as conveniences would allow. But I know
<PB N="110" REF="030041_0110_0FE412AD81D033F0">
that the general bath was al&s;o employed for the late fever, with great advantage, but under what particular circum&s;tances I cannot &s;peak with preci&s;ion. Doctor Charlton, of this city, a phy&s;ician of much experience, who had in many in&s;tances witne&s;&s;ed its good effects, favoured me with the following communication: <Q>I experienced the happie&s;t effects from cold bathing, in a variety of ca&s;es. I u&s;ed river-water, and had the patient placed in a large tub, and a couple of pails-full thrown over him. It happened in one in&s;tance only, that the patient did not feel &s;o much refre&s;hment, as to be impatient for a repetition of it. In this ca&s;e the patient grew chilly after u&s;ing the bath, which I thought a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for di&s;continuing it. In every other in&s;tance I found no method &s;o effectual for reliev|ing the extreme di&s;tre&s;s of the head and &s;tomach, &s;o generally attendant on that di&s;ea&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="030041_0111_0FE412AF71108818">
We find a &s;imilar practice recorded by Mr. Bruce, who &s;ays, that the inhabitants of Ma&s;uah are &s;ubject to violent fevers, which <Q>generally terminate the third day in death. If the patient &s;urvives till the fifth day, he very often recovered by drinking water only, and throwing a quantity of cold water upon him, even in his bed, where he is permitted to lie, without attempting to make him dry, or change his bed, till another deluge adds to the fir&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>In the u&s;e of cordial medicines, or drinks of that nature, much circum&s;pec|tion was nece&s;&s;ary. In the fir&s;t &s;tages of the di&s;ea&s;e, they were altogether inadmi&s;|&s;ible. They were pre&s;cribed in &s;ome in|&s;tances, after con&s;iderable remi&s;&s;ions had taken place, but manife&s;tly to the injury of the &s;ick. Even after complete inter|mi&s;&s;ions had formed, they &s;ometimes pro|duced a &s;tate of excitement, which ren|dered the patient's &s;ituation much le&s;s
<PB N="112" REF="030041_0112_0FE412B296703F58">
comfortable. The&s;e ob&s;ervations apply particularly to tho&s;e ca&s;es, where the re|mi&s;&s;ions took place at an early period, or where the di&s;ea&s;e did not run out beyond the fifth, &s;ixth or &s;eventh day. When the fever was of longer continuance, the debility it induced made the u&s;e of cordials not only allowable, but particularly nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Porter, more or le&s;s diluted, was found to agree better with the &s;ick than any other drink of the cordial kind: but its &s;alutary effects appeared very much to depend upon a liberal &s;tate of the bowels. When given conjointly with &s;ome mild purgative, it in|crea&s;ed the &s;trength, and very often &s;uper|&s;eded the u&s;e of any other tonic.</P>
<P>In the latter &s;tages of the complaint an infu&s;ion of &s;nake-root was al&s;o made u&s;e of with advantage. On many occa&s;ions it compo&s;ed the &s;tomach, &s;upported the &s;trength of the patient, without exciting him, and &s;eemed productive of very happy effects.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="030041_0113_0FE412B48CFEA130">
Much has been &s;aid and written re|&s;pecting the u&s;e of the lancet, and the ef|fects of bleeding in this di&s;ea&s;e. On this part of practice I &s;hall advance nothing, but what is the re&s;ult of experience and ob|&s;ervation. In general, the indications of cure were not &s;uppo&s;ed to include this operation; it was, therefore, but &s;eldom had recour&s;e to. In &s;ome of tho&s;e ca&s;es, in which the lancet was u&s;ed, the good effects of bleeding were obvious, more e&s;|pecially in relieving the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing pain in the head; whereas in other in&s;tances, and, where the &s;ymptoms &s;eemed to ren|der it peculiarly proper, it did not afford the relief that was expected from it; but, on the contrary, although the quantity of blood drawn was copious, and the bleeding frequently repeated, the patient &s;unk un|der the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>

where the pain in the head was extremely violent, and where the eyes, (to u&s;e a frequent expre&s;&s;ion of the &s;ick) &s;eem|ed ready to leap from their &s;ockets, <HI>and e&s;pecially if &s;uch a &s;ubject had ju&s;t arrived from the purer and cooler air of the country.</HI> In a per&s;on of this de&s;cription, the attack, and all the &s;ub&s;equent &s;ymptoms, are com|monly violent indeed; to moderate, there|fore, the exce&s;&s;ive action of the &s;y&s;tem, bleeding would probably be nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful. Under circum&s;tances like the&s;e, I have accordingly bled, and to good pur|po&s;e; but I have, previou&s;ly to blood-let|ting, directed my patient to drink freely of warm water; by which means I have ob&s;erved, that not only the action of the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem was much abated, but al|&s;o that the whole body more readily yield|ed to a copious per&s;piration. But if a per&s;on is attacked with this fever, who&s;e body has been previou&s;ly debilitated, per|haps by a &s;edentary manner of living, and
<PB N="115" REF="030041_0115_0FE412B828776BB8">
<HI>from having re&s;ided &s;ome time in the epidemic con&s;titution of the air,</HI> it could hardly be &s;uppo&s;ed that the &s;ame remedies would be required as in the former in&s;tance.</P>
<P>An attention to the above di&s;tinction of cau&s;es, as far as re&s;pects the remedy of bleeding particularly, may be of greater importance in the treatment of this di&s;or|der, than has been commonly imagined.</P>
<P>Opium was rarely admi&s;&s;ible in this fe|ver, and never in the fir&s;t &s;tage of it. But after the contents of the &s;tomach and bow|els were freely evacuated, and the exce&s;|&s;ive action of the &s;y&s;tem moderated, the u&s;e of it was ju&s;tified in many in&s;tances of &s;ucce&s;sful practice. Indeed, particular ca&s;es occurred, in which great irritation, re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, and want of &s;leep, could by no other means be &s;o well alleviated. When given under &s;uch circum&s;tances, it was commonly conjoined with &s;ome &s;udorific, and mo&s;t frequently with &s;p. mind. When, al&s;o, in the advanced &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e,
<PB N="116" REF="030041_0116_0FE412BBC7CA33A0">
the vomiting became exce&s;&s;ive, opium was admini&s;tered with the be&s;t effects.</P>
<P>Bli&s;ters were occa&s;ionally employed; they were found mo&s;t u&s;eful in removing local affections. If the head-ach continu|ed &s;evere, after free evacuations, a bli&s;ter, applied between the &s;houlders, often re|moved the pain. When the &s;ickne&s;s at the &s;tomach was great, attended with oppre&s;|&s;ion and pain, a bli&s;ter to the praecordia has often proved of advantage. Doctor Blane found nothing &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful in remo|ving irritability of the &s;tomach, as a bli&s;|ter applied externally to the part. When there has been a general &s;orene&s;s and ful|ne&s;s of the abdomen, which has not &s;ub|&s;ided after a free u&s;e of purgatives, the application of a bli&s;ter has produced the happie&s;t effects. A friend of mine had a young clergyman under his care, who&s;e di&s;ea&s;e, from its continuance, had become very formidable. He was covered with petechiae; his &s;tomach was ea&s;ily ex|cited;
<PB N="117" REF="030041_0117_0FE412BD73FFDFD8">
his &s;tools were generally of a dark colour, and &s;ometimes black. The bark had been tried, but it did not agree with him. Upon examining the abdomen, it was found univer&s;ally tender to the touch, but not painful. A large bli&s;ter was applied to the affected part, the ope|ration of which put an immediate check to the progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e. His drink was porter, to which water was occa&s;ion|ally added; and with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an ea&s;y diet, &s;uch as &s;ago, gruel, &amp;c. his re|covery was &s;oon completed.</P>
<P>The drinks which &s;eemed the mo&s;t grateful to the &s;ick, and were con&s;idered as the mo&s;t proper during the fever, were lemonade, water with toa&s;t in it, water alone, mola&s;&s;es and water, balm-tea, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The diet commonly recommended was &s;ago, tapioca, panado, and occa&s;ionally weak broths. The latter, however, fre|quently produced unea&s;ine&s;s at the &s;to|mach, which made it nece&s;&s;ary to de&s;i&s;t
<PB N="118" REF="030041_0118_0FE412BF221B6648">
from their u&s;e. A gruel made with In|dian-meal, or oat-meal, appeared, upon the whole, to agree better with the &s;ick than any other food; and, in many in|&s;tances, it con&s;tituted the whole diet and drink of the patient.</P>
<P>The u&s;e of animal food was uniform|ly attended with bad effects; the &s;malle&s;t quantity, taken in the intermi&s;&s;ion, has ha&s;tened the acce&s;&s;ion of fever, and in|crea&s;ed its violence. Even after the di&s;|ea&s;e had entirely &s;ub&s;ided, and debility only remained, a too early recurrence to animal food has brought on a renewal of fever.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add, that through the whole cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, the &s;tricte&s;t attention was paid to cleanline&s;s, e&s;pecially to the immediate removal of all excrementitious matter. The patient's linen, bed-cloaths, and often the bed it&s;elf, were frequently changed, and the refre&s;hment it always af|forded was a &s;ufficient proof of its utility.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="030041_0119_0FE412C117AFACC8">
The foregoing exhibits an unvarni&s;hed view of the hi&s;tory of the late epidemic, as far as it came under my notice; and of the practice, as far as it &s;eemed ra|tional, and was &s;ucce&s;sful under my ma|nagement: and I have purpo&s;ely avoided, as much as po&s;&s;ible, all theoretical or controver&s;ial grounds.</P>
<P>Indeed, I have been anxious about no|thing &s;o much as to fix upon the mind, the great and obvious di&s;tinction betwixt con|tagious di&s;ea&s;es, and tho&s;e which, under very peculiar circum&s;tances, may a&s;&s;ume much of that character.</P>
<P>The utility of this di&s;tinction is &s;o well &s;hewn by Doctor John Hunter, in his En|quiry into the Nature and Cau&s;es of the Remittant Fever, that I cannot do better than give his own ob&s;ervations upon the &s;ubject. <Q>There is hardly any part of the hi&s;tory of a di&s;ea&s;e (&s;ays the Doctor) which it is of more con&s;equence to a&s;certain with accuracy, than its being
<PB N="120" REF="030041_0120_0FE412C3E478F9A0">
of an infectious nature or not. Upon this depends the propriety of the &s;teps that &s;hould be taken, either to prevent it, or to root it out. It is productive of great mi&s;chief to con&s;ider a di&s;ea&s;e as infectious that really is not &s;o; it expo&s;es &s;uch as labour under it to evils and in|conveniences, which greatly aggravate their &s;ufferings, and often deprive them of the nece&s;&s;ary a&s;&s;i&s;tance: they are neg|lected, if not &s;hunned; and at the time they require the greate&s;t care and at|tention, they have the lea&s;t. I have had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, that the remit|tant fever, whether with its u&s;ual, or more uncommon &s;ymptoms, with the yellow colour of the eyes and &s;kin, or without them, was never found to be infectious. The &s;tronge&s;t proofs of this, in my opinion, were to be met with in private families, where the &s;on, the bro|ther, or the hu&s;band, labouring under the wor&s;t fevers, were nur&s;ed with un|remitting
<PB N="121" REF="030041_0121_0FE412C6148F9C60">
a&s;&s;iduity, by the mother, the &s;i&s;ter, or the wife, who never left the &s;ick by day or by night, yet without be|ing infected. That &s;uch near relations &s;hould take upon them the office of a nur&s;e, is matter of the highe&s;t commen|dation in a country, the di&s;ea&s;es of which require to be watched with greater care and attention than can be expected from a &s;ervant.</Q></P>
<P>Why the late epidemic, in many in|&s;tances during its de&s;tructive progre&s;s in this city, wore the dreadful a&s;pect of con|tagion, may be gathered, in a good degree, from the few following particulars, with|in the knowledge of us all, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> The la&s;t &s;ummer, and a great part of the au|tumn, were marked by an uncommon degree of heat, combined with moi&s;ture. The atmo&s;phere, which, at that &s;ea&s;on, is ordinarily loaded with the electric fluid, &s;eemed de&s;titute, for weeks together, of this vivifying principle. The inten&s;e
<PB N="122" REF="030041_0122_0FE412C80D63A490">
heats which we often experience in the forenoons of July and Augu&s;t, are gene|rally allayed by thunder and lightning, and the refre&s;hing rains, which follow towards the evening; but in the &s;ea&s;on re|ferred to, this precious relief from the lan|guor induced by a verticle &s;un, was &s;el|dom felt.</P>
<P>Now, when we reflect that a great ma|jority of tho&s;e who fell victims to the late epidemic fever were not only foreigners, but poor per&s;ons, many of whom had been only a few weeks in the country, arrived after a long voyage, and predi&s;po&s;ed to &s;ickne&s;s by hard and &s;canty fare; hud|dled together, in a great many in&s;tances, in the mo&s;t uncomfortable apartments, and the&s;e &s;ituated in the mo&s;t unhealthy parts of the city; frequently without the early at|tention of a phy&s;ician, de&s;titute of friends, and often without the mo&s;t common com|forts of life; under &s;uch di&s;tre&s;&s;ing cir|cum&s;tances, notwith&s;tanding the huma|nity
<PB N="123" REF="030041_0123_0FE412C9B6C5CE08">
of the citizens, were numbers placed; and what con&s;equences, but tho&s;e which followed, could rea&s;onably have been ex|pected?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the former part of this essay, we enumerated many circumstances which tended to shew, that the season of the late epidemic more especially, was attended with <HI>an uncom|mon constitution of the air.</HI> Since these observations were put together, I have been favoured with a letter from Mr. Gardiner Baker, proprietor of the Museum in this city, who mentions several occurrences illustrative of the same thing. He observes, <Q>Books in my libra|ry, and those that were in daily use, were covered with mould. All the preserved animals in the Mu|seum, that were not contained in glass cases, were in|jured very much by the long continued atmos|pheric moisture, and some of them quite spoiled; parti|cularly a very finely preserved buffaloe, which had, in the course of twelve years, been exposed to every climate on the continent, without shewing the least disposi|tion to decay. But, in the month of August last, upon applying my hand under the belly, I found it as wet as if taken out of water, and soon after this part of the ani|mal began to fall, piece by piece, as large as my two hands, until the whole of the belly had fallen to the floor. Fish that had been well preserved for several weeks, had collected so much moisture from the air, that drops of water fell from them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I have a very excellent electrical machine, and have been in the daily habit of using it; but during the sick|ness, when the appearance of the atmosphere was the most favourable, I could not, with all my art or industry, excite it, so as to answer any purpose in experiment&punc; &amp;c. when, in the ordinary state of the atmosphere, four or five revolutions of the cylinder, will give as hard a shock as a man can bear with convenience.</Q></P>
<P>The foregoing observations of Mr. Baker prove, in a re|markable degree, that there was a prevailing property in the air, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>extreme moisture.</HI> The annexed table will ex|hibit the degree of heat, which appears, upon an average, to exceed the usual temperature several degrees.</P>

<HEAD>HILLARY.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t indication of cure, Doctor Hillary ob|&s;erves, is <Q>to moderate the too great and rapid motion of the fluids, and abate the heat and violence of the
<PB N="126" REF="030041_0126_0FE412D1B0ADC6D8">
fever, in the two fir&s;t days of the di&s;ea&s;e. Wherefore bleeding, in the beginning of the fir&s;t &s;tage of this fe|ver, either to a greater or le&s;s quantity, accordingly as the following &s;ymptoms and circum&s;tances indicate, is always ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary: and the quantity to be ta|ken away &s;hould always be as the age and &s;trength of the patient, the degree of the plethora, and the greater or le&s;s ela&s;tic &s;tate of the &s;olids, the fulne&s;s of his pul&s;e, and the violence of the fever and its &s;ymptoms. For which rea&s;on, when I have been called in time, (which is too &s;eldom the ca&s;e) I generally order 12, 14, 16, 18, or 20 ounces of blood to be taken away on the fir&s;t or &s;econd day; but always, as the above &s;ymp|toms and rules indicate and direct: and if the patient's pul&s;e ri&s;es after the fir&s;t bleeding, or if the fever con|tinues to be &s;till high, and the pul&s;e full, (for it is ne|ver high in this fever) I repeat the bleeding once, in the fir&s;t or &s;econd day of the di&s;ea&s;e, if the above mentioned &s;ymptoms indicate it; but bleeding a third time is &s;eldom or never required, neither is bleeding on the third day almo&s;t ever required; and when it is performed on that day, it ought not to be advi&s;ed without great caution and judgment; neither &s;hould a vein be opened after the third day in this fever, unle&s;s &s;ome very extraordinary &s;ymptoms and circum&s;tances require it, which very rarely or never happen. I have always found that taking away a moderate, but &s;ufficient quantity of blood on the fir&s;t or &s;econd days, has rendered the fever more moderate, and abated the putre&s;cent diathe&s;is afterwards. But as to the quantity of blood to be taken away in this ca&s;e, either the fir&s;t or &s;econd time, or on the fir&s;t or &s;econd days, it is impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain it, &s;ince that
<PB N="127" REF="030041_0127_0FE412D3A7259B40">
mu&s;t be different, in different patients; becau&s;e &s;ome con&s;titutions can better bear the lo&s;s of fifty ounces of blood than others can the lo&s;s of eight or ten; therefore, the only rules that can be given are tho&s;e laid down before.</Q></P>
<P>The irritable &s;tate of the &s;tomach, Doctor Hillary &s;ays, forbids the u&s;e of emetics; but to carry off the contents of this organ, a liberal u&s;e of warm water is recommended, which greatly relieves the patient. In the next place, <Q>in order to gain a truce, and &s;ome re&s;pite from the anxiety, and almo&s;t continual reaching, vomiting, and &s;ickne&s;s, which are not in|crea&s;ed, but &s;omewhat relieved by drinking the warm water, I u&s;ually give extract&punc; thebaic. g. I vel. g. I &s;s. and order them to take nothing into their &s;tomachs for two hours after it, that they may retain it; and it be|ing in &s;o &s;mall a compa&s;s, they &s;carce ever reject it. By this method the poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed patient gets &s;ome re&s;t and re&s;pite, and all the &s;ymptoms are generally con&s;iderably abated, the reaching and vomiting ei|ther totally cea&s;es, or do but &s;eldom return; &s;o that other medicines may be given and retained on the &s;tomach, which it would not retain before; &s;uch as cooling acid juleps, or other antiphlogi&s;tic and anti|&s;eptic medicines.</Q></P>
<P>The evacuation of the bowels is the next circum|&s;tance to which Doctor Hillary directs our attention. He attempts this fir&s;t by gly&s;ters, <Q>and after &s;ix or eight hours re&s;t and re&s;pite, he orders a gentle antiphlogi&s;|tic and anti&s;eptic purge.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Or if the patient has a purging before, which &s;ometimes, though very &s;eldom happens, I order a gentle do&s;e of toa&s;ted rhubarb to be given, and an an|ti&s;eptic
<PB N="128" REF="030041_0128_0FE412D881BE78E0">
anodyne, after it has operated, to abate and check the too much purging, but not to &s;top it, as I have always ob&s;erved it to be of &s;ervice in this ca&s;e, provided that it is moderate, and not too violent: and I ob&s;erved that all tho&s;e who had this purging, gene|rally did well with it, if the patient's &s;trength was but properly &s;upported with &s;uitable nouri&s;hment, and proper anti&s;eptic medicines, which la&s;t are al|ways ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in this fever.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And though purging in many other fevers, may be deemed bad practice, yet in this fever, as nature in|dicated it, I have always found it of &s;ingular &s;ervice, and the patient not only greatly relieved by it, but the di&s;ea&s;e always rendered more moderate and manage|able afterwards.</Q></P>
<P>Doctor Hillary not only purges in the beginning of the di&s;ea&s;e, but, &s;ays he, <Q>and I mo&s;t commonly find it nece&s;&s;ary to repeat this purging every &s;econd or third day, for two or three times, and &s;ometimes, when the &s;ymptoms are very bad, and have not much abated upon taking the fir&s;t and &s;econd purge, and the patient has not been treated in the method before de&s;cribed, or I have not been called in till late in the di&s;ea&s;e, I have found it nece&s;&s;ary to repeat the gentle purging every day, for four or five days &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively, and with the de&s;ired &s;ucce&s;s too.</Q></P>

<Q><P>The fir&s;t patient I was called to, was one An|drews, a plethoric, mu&s;cular man, about twenty-five years of age: he had not complained three hours when I &s;aw him, about ten in the forenoon; yet the oppre&s;&s;ion on the praecordia, and the bilious vomit|ings had already &s;eized him. His pul&s;e was full and &s;trong, and I took &s;ixteen ounces of blood from his arm immediately, and ordered a laxative cly&s;ter to
<PB N="130" REF="030041_0130_0FE412DC1F1CC090">
be injected as &s;oon as it could be got ready, and en|joined him to drink plentifully of barley water, acidu|lated with the juice of the lime. I called upon him at noon, and was much di&s;appointed to find the ardent &s;ymptoms, and the oppre&s;&s;ion on his brea&s;t both in|crea&s;ed: his vomitings were almo&s;t continual, and he complained much of di&s;tre&s;s on breathing, and of the burning of his eyes. The rea&s;ons for bleeding him &s;till continuing, I took fourteen ounces of blood from the &s;ame orifice, and ordered him, the &s;ame evening, a &s;cruple of ipecacuanha at &s;ix o'clock, and at ten applied a large bli&s;ter between his &s;houlders, in hopes of relieving his che&s;t.</P>
<P>He continued to vomit, with but &s;hort intermi&s;|&s;ions, from the time he took the emetic, although he di&s;charged a great deal of bile by &s;tool. He had a very re&s;tle&s;s night, and continued through the &s;e|cond day, vomiting, and labouring under the oppre&s;|&s;ion of his brea&s;t, till about twelve at night, when he died; about forty hours from the time of his be|ing fir&s;t &s;eized.</P>
<P>At this time the practice in Barbadoes was, to u&s;e large and repeated bleeding, vomiting, and bli&s;tering, as recommended by Doctor Town, which method I, as a &s;tranger, thought my&s;elf obliged to follow.</P>
<P>Before Andrews died, &s;everal others were taken ill, and, except the &s;econd bleeding, which was omit|ted, they were treated the &s;ame way, with no better &s;ucce&s;s.</P></Q>
<P>Doctor Hume next relates the morbid appearances exhibited upon opening the bodies of the two fir&s;t men who died. There were an inlarged liver, and <Q>evi|dent marks of inflammation on the lower extremity
<PB N="131" REF="030041_0131_0FE412DDCB294CC0">
of the &s;tomach, and likewi&s;e on the &s;uperior part of the duodenum.</Q></P>
<Q><P>No marks of mortification were found on the in|ternal or external &s;urface of the &s;tomachs of either of the&s;e men; but I opened two not long after, who died in a more advanced &s;tate of the di&s;ea&s;e, and found one of them, who had vomited the black matter, in a &s;tate of mortification every where, and &s;ome coagu|lated blood in it; the internal coats of the other were covered with livid &s;pots of different &s;izes, and, exter|nally, towards the bottom, there were large black &s;pots of the &s;ize of a crown piece.</P>
<P>Having ob&s;erved, with much regret, the bad &s;uc|ce&s;s I had from bleeding and vomiting, and that the fir&s;t man who died evidently &s;unk after the fir&s;t bleeding, I bled the re&s;t but once; and when the pa|tients were not plethoric, I have frequently omitted the operation altogether, as I &s;ometimes did when I had not &s;een them within twenty-four hours of be|ing taken ill.</P>
<P>I have &s;een &s;ome &s;ubjects opened, on who&s;e &s;to|machs no marks of inflammation could be di&s;cover|ed, yet even the&s;e had exce&s;&s;ive vomitings.</P>
<P>The &s;tate in which I found the &s;tomachs of the two fir&s;t men who died, deterred me from giving any more vomits; and I have ever found that bowel &s;o deli|cate and irritable, that I have never &s;ince ventured to give any emetic whatever. There &s;eems, however, a nece&s;&s;ity to evacuate the bile by the &s;tomach, by the inte&s;tines, and by the &s;kin, when there is a tendency to &s;weat.</P>
<P>After bleeding, I u&s;ed to order a cly&s;ter of &amp;c. and for common drink, I ordered a plea&s;ant &s;herbett made of fre&s;h, ripe limes, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="030041_0132_0FE412E0B04C8C38">
I found this not only a plea&s;ant drink for the &s;ick, but looked upon it as the mo&s;t powerful anti&s;eptic, and antiemetic I could give them. It is true that on fir&s;t u&s;ing, it was thrown up as fa&s;t as water, when an emetic is given; but &s;uch as had re&s;olution to per&s;evere in drinking it, &s;oon found their &s;ick fits le&s;s &s;evere; and, after the fir&s;t three or four draughts, every &s;ucceeding one remained longer on the &s;tomach than that before it, &s;o that, in a few hours, the inter|mi&s;&s;ions between the fits of vomiting came to be &s;o lengthened, that I could attempt giving &s;ome mild purgative medicine. I commonly ordered two ounces of manna, and one of cream of tartar, di&s;&s;olved in three pints of lemonade. Of this I gave them a few &s;poonfuls, or a tea-cup full, at &s;uch di&s;|tances of time, as I thought their &s;tomachs could bear.</P>
<P>Manna and cream of tartar was continued occa|&s;ionally, through the whole cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, on|ly it was &s;ometimes changed for tincture of rhubarb, drawn in weak cinnamon-water, to render it more grateful to the &s;tomach. When the&s;e failed of pro|ducing frequent bilious &s;tools, gly&s;ters were injected; but the heat, frequency, and acrimony of the&s;e bi|lious &s;tools, often deprived me of this re&s;ource, for the extremity of the rectum, many times, became &s;o tender as not to be able to bear the introduction of the &s;malle&s;t and &s;moothe&s;t pipe.</P>
<P>When I ob&s;erved any tendency to &s;weating, I al|ways di&s;continued the laxative medicines, and gave &s;ix drachms, or an ounce of the &s;p. mind. and re|peated the do&s;e in five or &s;ix hours, if the &s;weat con|tinued &s;o long, encouraging the &s;ick to drink a weak

infu&s;ion of &s;age, acidulated, if they de&s;ired to have it &s;o.</P></Q>
<P>Doctor Hume recommends the application of bli&s;|ters to the thighs, to relieve the &s;evere vomitings. "When," &s;ays he, <Q>the &s;ick complained much of the bli&s;ters of their thighs, the vomiting u&s;ually began to abate, and to cea&s;e entirely, as the irritation and inflammation increa&s;ed.</Q></P>
<Q><P>This fever, like &s;ome others, often ends in &s;cabby eruptions about the mouth and no&s;e, and &s;ometimes I have &s;een &s;mall biles, from the &s;ize of a common pea to that of a hor&s;e-bean, break out on the brea&s;t, &s;ides, &s;houlders, or hips, and prove critical.</P>
<P>There is one critical appearance, which I do not remember to have &s;een taken notice of by any wri|ter on the bilious fever, and which, I believe, has been ob&s;erved by few practitioners, (it &s;ometimes happens in the third &s;tage, and &s;ometimes in the cour&s;e of it) which is, one or more clu&s;ters of &s;mall florid eruptions on or near the pit of the &s;tomach, not larger than mea&s;les, and from three or four to &s;even or eight in a clu&s;ter.</P>
<P>In whatever &s;tate of the di&s;ea&s;e, the &s;ick are re|lieved, whether by &s;weats, bilious &s;tools, biles, erup|tions, or by bli&s;ters, and it is evident from the ce&s;&s;a|tion of the vomiting, from the load at the brea&s;t be|ing removed, and from the re&s;piration becoming ea|&s;ier, that the fever is giving way, we &s;hould attempt to give the bark: &s;ooner would be to no purpo&s;e, for it would hurt the patient, by exa&s;perating the &s;ymp|toms.</P></Q>
<P>To the infu&s;ions of bark, u&s;ed by Doctor Hume, &s;nake-root was added.</P>

<HEAD>DOCTOR JACKSON ON THE FEVERS OF JAMAICA, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>Doctor Jack&s;on, after dividing the yellow fever into three &s;pecies, and giving the &s;ymptoms attending each form, proceeds to the method of cure.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="treatment">
<HEAD>Treatment of the fir&s;t &s;pecies.</HEAD>
<P>"The &s;pecies of the yellow fever," &s;ays he, <Q>which I have now de&s;cribed, is univer&s;ally allowed to be a terrible di&s;ea&s;e; and there are few, I believe, &s;o un|candid as to boa&s;t of general &s;ucce&s;s in the manner of curing it. A road is, therefore, left open, not on|ly for improvement, but almo&s;t for total innovation. The only author I have read on the &s;ubject, or the practitioners with whom I am acquainted, do not &s;eem to have extended their views beyond the &s;ymp|toms of the di&s;ea&s;e. There are &s;ome, who, from ob|&s;erving that there is pain in the head, and flu&s;hing of the face, recommend bleeding; others, from the pre|&s;ence of nau&s;ea, or inclination to vomit, make trial of emetics; and many, from various cau&s;es, in&s;i&s;t on the indi&s;pen&s;ible u&s;e of cathartics. My views, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, are different from tho&s;e of preceding authors. Bleeding was employed occa&s;ionally; emetics were
<PB N="135" REF="030041_0135_0FE412E6B488A778">
cautiou&s;ly avoided; but time appeared to be too pre|cious to be &s;pent in attending to the effects of ca|thartics, which cannot often be known in le&s;s than twenty-four hours; and which at be&s;t are precarious and feeble. In&s;tead, therefore, of attempting to eva|cuate redundant bile, or to correct it when &s;uppo&s;ed to be vitiated, I exerted my&s;elf from the fir&s;t moment that I was called to the patient, to change the genius and natural temper of the di&s;ea&s;e; or, if I may be al|lowed the expre&s;&s;ion, to take the bu&s;ine&s;s, as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible, out of the hands of nature.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I remark, in the fir&s;t place, that I generally began the cure of this &s;pecies of the yellow fever with bleed|ing. Bleeding was employed in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, chiefly with a view of paving the way to remedies of greater efficacy. It was, however, found to mo|derate the violence of local pain, particularly the violence of the head-ach, and to be not altogether without effect in retarding the u&s;ual rapid progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e. It has hitherto been thought nece&s;&s;ary, indeed almo&s;t indi&s;pen&s;ible, to empty the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;a|ges in this &s;pecies of fever; but time is &s;hort, and the good which accrues from &s;uch evacuations, is not very certain, and often not e&s;&s;ential. It was, there|fore, thought &s;ufficient to tru&s;t this intention, for the mo&s;t part, to laxative gly&s;ters; after the employment of which, (bleeding having been premi&s;ed in &s;uch quantity as was deemed proper) the patient was wa&s;h|ed clean, and bathed in warm water, in as complete a manner as the circum&s;tances of &s;ituation would permit. It is needle&s;s to mention that this was done with a view to increa&s;e the mobility of the &s;y&s;tem, and to remove &s;pa&s;modic &s;tricture from the extreme
<PB N="136" REF="030041_0136_0FE412EB08AEABE8">
ve&s;&s;els of the &s;urface; in con&s;equence of which, greater benefit was expected from the application of cold &s;alt water, which was da&s;hed &s;uddenly from a bucket on the head and &s;houlders. This practice may appear hazardous to tho&s;e who argue without experience; but I can vouch for its general &s;afety, and bear te&s;timony to its good effects. Sweat, with perfect relief from all the feelings of anxiety and di&s;|tre&s;s, was generally the con&s;equence of this mode of treatment. If employed within the fir&s;t twelve hours from the attack, it &s;eldom failed of removing all the &s;ymptoms of danger; or of affecting a total and com|plete change in the nature and circum&s;tances of the di&s;ea&s;e; but if the progre&s;s was more advanced, though the &s;ame rule of practice might &s;till be proper, the execution required more boldne&s;s and deci&s;ion. It is only po&s;&s;ible to judge from the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, at this period, of the nece&s;&s;ity or propriety of bleeding, and of emptying the lower inte&s;tines, by means of gly&s;ters; but when bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hall have been accompli&s;hed, in &s;uch manner as &s;hall have been deemed right, or conducive to the main view, it will be advi&s;able to &s;have the head, to bathe the whole body in warm water, and in&s;tantly to da&s;h cold water from a bucket on the head and &s;houlders. I have even &s;ometimes, where there was an appear|ance of greater ob&s;tinacy, ventured to wrap the whole body in a blanket &s;oaked in &s;ea-water, or in water in which was di&s;&s;olved a large portion of &s;alt. If anx|iety was great, or nau&s;ea and vomiting trouble&s;ome, I have al&s;o ob&s;erved benefit from the application of a bli&s;ter to the epiga&s;tic region. Opiates, joined with remedies which had a tendency to determine to the
<PB N="137" REF="030041_0137_0FE412ED02D45D80">
&s;urface, were found to be &s;erviceable; and wine, with a &s;upply of fre&s;h and cool air, in mo&s;t ca&s;es was high|ly nece&s;&s;ary. This method of proceeding will, per|haps, be thought unwarrantable, but I can &s;peak con|fidently of its &s;afety; and I may further add, that unle&s;s &s;ome decided &s;teps are taken to change the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e, during the continuance of this &s;tage, our future endeavours to do good will gene|rally be in vain. I have hitherto promi&s;ed &s;ucce&s;s in the cure of this fever, with a good deal of confi|dence; but if it &s;hould &s;o happen, that we are not called to the patient till the yellowne&s;s has &s;pread over the whole of the body, or till the black vomiting has begun to make its appearance, the pro&s;pect, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, is then very dark. The ordinary re|&s;ources of our art are feeble; and if good can be done at all, it can only be done by means, which, in the common opinion of practitioners, border on ra&s;hne&s;s. In this latter &s;tage of the complaint, &s;o great a degree of torpor overwhelms the powers of life, that remedies do not produce their u&s;ual effect, and our labour is often the &s;ame, as if we attempted to re&s;u&s;citate a corp&s;e. I have, however, &s;een in|&s;tances of &s;uch unexpected recoveries, from the mo&s;t hopele&s;s &s;tate in fevers, that I &s;eldom totally de&s;pair as long as life remains. I know that death may be prevented, even after black vomiting has appeared, with all its terrors, if a remedy can be found power|ful enough to excite the action of the extreme ve&s;&s;els, and to recall the determination to the &s;urface of the body. For this purpo&s;e, I have employed alternate|ly, warm and cold bathing, with &s;ucce&s;s. I have even wrapt the body, as I mentioned before, in a
<PB N="138" REF="030041_0138_0FE412EEAC575180">
blanket &s;oaked in water, in which a large portion of &s;alt was di&s;&s;olved, or which had been &s;teeped in bran|dy or rum, enjoining, at the &s;ame time, the liberal u&s;e of wine, or even more powerful cordials. I have heard of &s;ome well atte&s;ted in&s;tances, where plenti|ful draughts of rum and water have checked the vo|miting, and apparently &s;aved the lives of patients, af|ter the medical people had given them up for lo&s;t.</Q></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="treatment">
<HEAD>Treatment of the &s;econd &s;pecies.</HEAD>
<P><Q>The cure of this &s;pecies of the di&s;ea&s;e, though by no means ea&s;y, was le&s;s difficult, upon the whole, than that of the former. In&s;tead of the torpor and in&s;en&s;ibility, which prevailed in the latter periods of the proper yellow fever,</Q> (for Doctor Jack&s;on con|&s;iders the fir&s;t de&s;cribed &s;pecies as the true yellow fe|ver of Jamaica) <Q>the mobility of the nervous &s;y&s;tem was &s;o much increa&s;ed in the pre&s;ent &s;pecies of di&s;|ea&s;e, that remedies &s;eldom failed of producing &s;en&s;i|ble effects: and wherever remedies produce effects, it is generally in our power to manage the bu&s;ine&s;s in &s;uch a manner, that &s;ome good may ari&s;e. It may be ob&s;erved in the fir&s;t place, with regard to the cure, that bleeding, which frequently was u&s;eful in the for|mer &s;pecies, was generally hurtful in the pre&s;ent; and that, in&s;tead of retarding, it oftener accelerated the progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e. Emetics were employed, very commonly, by the practitioners of the We&s;t-Indies, in this as in other ca&s;es of fever; but I can|not help remarking, that languor and debility, fre|quently yellowne&s;s, and &s;ometimes a continual vo|miting, which no remedies could re&s;train, were often the con&s;equence of antimonial emetics of &s;evere operation; and I have no doubt in &s;aying, that the
<PB N="139" REF="030041_0139_0FE412F0C7FBEA30">
approach of death was actually ha&s;tened, in &s;everal in&s;tances, by this method of treatment. Laxatives were occa&s;ionally of &s;ervice; but the &s;tronger purga|tives frequently hurtful. Bli&s;ters were often ex|tremely beneficial; but it requires care and di&s;cern|ment to apply them in the proper circum&s;tances, &s;o as to reap the full advantage. Opiates were &s;ometimes &s;erviceable; and bark and wine, in mo&s;t in&s;tances, were remedies of great value; but the principal tru&s;t was placed in warm and cold bathing, which, under proper management, &s;eldom failed of an&s;wering every expectation completely, or &s;peedily of removing the chief &s;ymptoms of danger. Sometimes it appeared to cut &s;hort the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e abruptly.</Q></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="treatment">
<P>In the next place, as introductory to the &s;ymptoms and method of cure, of the third &s;pecies of yellow fever, Doctor Jack&s;on ob&s;erves, <Q>I have now de&s;cribed two &s;pecies of fever, which &s;eem to be, in &s;ome degree, peculiar to the natives of northern regions, &s;oon af|ter their arrival in the We&s;t-Indies. In the one, a determination to the alimentary canal and biliary or|gans, with marks of putre&s;cent tendency, in the ge|neral ma&s;s of fluids, was di&s;coverable at an early period; in the other, the brain and nervous &s;y&s;tem were more particularly and principally affected; while the &s;pecies of which I now attempt to give &s;ome account, exhibited &s;trong marks of va&s;cular ex|citement, with a very high degree of apparent in|flammatory diathe&s;is. This was more irregular in its appearances, and more complicated in its nature, than the others. The marks of inflammatory diathe|&s;is were generally very apparent in the beginning; but they u&s;ually gave way, or became complicated
<PB N="140" REF="030041_0140_0FE412F4B6D02678">
in the latter &s;tages, with &s;ymptoms of putre&s;cency or nervous affection.</Q></P>
<P>Speaking of the cure of this &s;pecies, he &s;ays, <Q>if we proceed on the fir&s;t obvious view of the di&s;ea&s;e, we &s;hall often do irreparable mi&s;chief, by copious and repeated evacuations; yet there will not be le&s;s dan|ger, on the other hand, if, regardle&s;s of the pre&s;ent degree of excitement, we indulge freely in the u&s;e of &s;timulants. It is nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve a middle cour&s;e; and, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that it is &s;ometimes dif|ficult to do any thing without doing harm. Bleed|ing was frequently employed in the cure of this di&s;|ea&s;e, and, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, it was an u&s;eful remedy, though le&s;s perhaps from its own effects merely, than from paving the way to other more powerful appli|cations. It is, however, capable of being ea&s;ily carried to exce&s;s; and ought not to be tru&s;ted to wholly for the removing the irritability, and high degree of excitement, which prevail &s;o generally in the beginning of this di&s;ea&s;e. After bleeding, eme|tics and cathartics are employed very freely. I have always profe&s;&s;ed my&s;elf an enemy to the practice of giving emetics in the fevers of Jamaica; yet I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that antimonials were not only &s;afer, but of more particular <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> in this, than in any other &s;pe|cies of fever where I have &s;een them tried. Among the great variety of forms which have been recom|mended by practitioners, for the purpo&s;e of empty|ing the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages, I have not found any one an|&s;wer &s;o well, as a thin &s;olution of the &s;al catharti|cum, given at different intervals, with a &s;mall por|tion of emetic tartar, and &s;ometimes with the addi|tion of laudanum. The operation of this remedy
<PB N="141" REF="030041_0141_0FE412F6ADCD6B08">
was exten&s;ive. It might be &s;o managed as to pro|mote nau&s;ea, or vomiting, &s;weat, or moderate evacu|ations downwards; at the &s;ame time, it proved very powerfully &s;edative. I may likewi&s;e add, that I have &s;ometimes found benefit from nitre, camphor, and opium, given in pretty large do&s;es, and accompani|ed with plentiful dilution. But though the&s;e reme|dies were often &s;erviceable, and contributed, in many ca&s;es, to moderate the high degree of irritability; yet the chief dependence of the cure was much better tru&s;ted to cold bathing. After the &s;urface of the body had become &s;ufficiently relaxed, by the pre|vious u&s;e of warm bathing and fomentations, the ef|fects of cold bathing were wonderful. The exce&s;|&s;ive irritability was moderated or removed, and the powers of life were invigorated, in a very &s;ingular manner, in con&s;equence of it.</Q></P>

If a per&s;on, newly arrived in the We&s;t-Indies, has &s;ubjected him&s;elf to any of the cau&s;es which may produce this fever, previous to the attack he has &s;uf|ficient warning given him, if he will attend to it, and time enough, in general, to cure it by anticipation. For, as &s;oon as any heavine&s;s, or re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, or la&s;&s;i|tude, or &s;tretching and yawning is perceived, he has rea&s;on to expect that they are the harbingers of this tragedy, and he &s;hould immediately be blooded, and take a do&s;e of &s;alts, and dilute plentifully, and keep him&s;elf quiet and cool; and after the operation of the &s;alts, he &s;hould take &s;mall do&s;es of <HI>James's powder,</HI> live low, and drink barley-water. After the body is well evacuated, and cooled, it is always prudent to take the bark.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t &s;tage of the fever, when it has made a regular attack, when the&s;e precautions have not been u&s;ed, or when they have failed, and the patient is no longer able to ab&s;tain from his bed, he &s;hould be kept in a large room, as cool as po&s;&s;ible, covered lightly with bed-clothes, with a circulation of air admitted into the room, but not directly upon or near the bed: and this mu&s;t be ob&s;erved through the whole of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Bleeding mu&s;t then be performed, and mu&s;t be re|peated every &s;ix or eight hours, or whenever the ex|acerbations come on, while the heat, fulne&s;s of pul&s;e, and pains continue; and, if the&s;e &s;ymptoms be violent and ob&s;tinate, and do not abate during the fir&s;t thirty-&s;ix or forty-eight hours of the fever, bleeding &s;hould be executed <HI>u&s;que ad animi de|liquium.</HI></P>

The blood taken away in the beginning is very flo|rid, and of the arterial blood colour; and the &s;urface never &s;izy, and &s;eldom contracted.</P>
<P>The intention of bleeding can be an&s;wered only by performing it immediately, and in the mo&s;t exten|&s;ive manner, which the high &s;tate of inflamma|tion, and the rapid progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e, demand, Taking away only &s;ix or eight ounces of blood, becau&s;e the patient may faint, which is a &s;ymptom of the di&s;ea&s;e, is doing nothing towards the cure. Where bleeding is improper, no blood &s;hould be taken; where it is proper, that quantity cannot re|lieve&mdash;and it is lo&s;ing that time which can never be regained.</P>
<P>Bleeding, it is evident, mu&s;t not be performed in any other &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e than the fir&s;t, or in|flammatory &s;tage; but this has been injudiciou&s;ly done, which has given ri&s;e to the notion, that a pa|tient will &s;eldom bear more than two bleedings.</P>
<P>Many practitioners have been deterred from bleed|ing their patients from the depre&s;&s;ion of the pul&s;e, and from the faintne&s;s which &s;ometimes accompanies the very fir&s;t on&s;et of this fever; but here the pul&s;e always ri&s;es, and the faintne&s;s di&s;appears, as the heart is relieved from its oppre&s;&s;ion by the lo&s;s of blood.</P>
<P>Faintne&s;s and depre&s;&s;ion of the pul&s;e here are not to be con&s;idered like tho&s;e circum&s;tances where putri|faction has commenced, or where there has been long and fatiguing illne&s;s: they are &s;ymptoms here of <HI>ple|thora,</HI> the rever&s;e of inanition; and bleeding is ad|vi&s;ed for &s;uch &s;yncopes by two of the greate&s;t phy&s;i|cians the world has produced.</P>

Nor is fainting, during the operation, any rea&s;on for not repeating it, in the fir&s;t &s;tage of the fever; for I have often cured it by bleeding only: and it has frequently happened in the We&s;t-Indies, that acci|dental bleeding from the orifice, when a patient has fallen a&s;leep, to far greater quantities than has ever been directed to be taken away, has carried off the fever entirely; and the &s;urpri&s;e on di&s;covering a pro|fu&s;ion of blood in the bed, has been changed to joy for the alteration it has produced in the patient.</P>
<P>The effects of nature would be oftener &s;ucce&s;sful than they are, were not her powers totally overcome in hot climates. Bleeding at the no&s;e, in the fir&s;t &s;tage of this fever, has &s;ometimes removed it; and it is as certain a &s;olution of this fever, as it is of the <HI>cau&s;us</HI> in Europe.</P>
<P>In the early part of the di&s;ea&s;e &s;pontaneous hae|morrhage is always critical, and &s;hould never be &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed; afterwards it is &s;ymptomatical, and if not &s;topped, the patient &s;oon &s;inks under it.</P>
<P>Eruptions about the lips and no&s;e, painful biles, or phlegmons about the body, which always &s;uppurate unkindly, or an ab&s;ce&s;s forming, are al&s;o critical, and generally terminate the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Sweating, in the fir&s;t &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e, is &s;eldom critical. Whenever &s;weats are critical, which may happen very early in the di&s;ea&s;e, if the patient has been well evacuated, they are accompanied with a ce&s;&s;ation of vomiting, and a change in the appearance of the urine; the &s;weating is then to be a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly promoted, and if preceded by a bleeding of the no&s;e, it is a complete cri&s;is.</P>

The &s;ickne&s;s of the &s;tomach, and di&s;agreeable ta&s;te in the mouth, indicate the quality, and not the quantity of the offending &s;ecretions. The vomiting is from irritation in the &s;tomach, and not from plenitude; therefore vomits are never to be given, though &s;trongly advi&s;ed by Towne: no, not &s;o much as warm water, recommended by Hillary, for fear of exciting and &s;tirring up that terrible operation, which, when once begun, no art can &s;ometimes allay.</P>
<P>When a &s;ufficient quantity of blood has been taken away, which is never done, let the patient's habit be what it may, while the heat, reiterated exacerbations, flu&s;hings in the face, thir&s;t, pains in the head, and burning in the eyes remain, the &s;tep is to evacuate the contents of the bowels, and turn the humours downwards.</P>
<P>But if large and repeated bleedings, during the two fir&s;t days, &s;hould not remove the thir&s;t, pains, flu&s;h|ings, and heat in the eyes, and the &s;tate of the &s;to|mach &s;hould be &s;uch as to reject every thing that is taken, &s;o that there is no chance of procuring eva|cuation by &s;tool, the patient &s;hould have repeated purgative gly&s;ters, and be put in a tepid bath.</P>
<P>The bath &s;hould be compo&s;ed of a very weak de|coction of camomile flowers, in which a little nitre may be di&s;&s;olved, and a little vinegar added.</P>
<P>This will often remove every &s;ymptom at once, and di&s;po&s;e the patient to a <HI>diaphore&s;is,</HI> which mu&s;t be promoted until a &s;ufficient quantity of &s;ome pur|gative medicine can be taken, &s;o as to make an effec|tual operation downwards.</P>
<P>There is &s;eldom a nece&s;&s;ity to repeat the bath, as the &s;trictures and ten&s;ion generally yield to the fir&s;t
<PB N="146" REF="030041_0146_0FE413035308E4F0">
immer&s;ion. The patient &s;hould not remain long in the bath, nor &s;hould it be deferred till late in the di&s;|ea&s;e, for it can be of no u&s;e when the &s;tomach is de|&s;troyed.</P>
<P>Soft, &s;mooth drinks, free from any &s;timulating tendency, &s;uch as barley-water, always an&s;wer be&s;t for common drink, and are no impediment in the way of medicine.</P>
<P>Gly&s;ters are to be frequently given in the beginning of the di&s;ea&s;e, particularly where the patient is co&s;|tive, and to precede the u&s;e of cathartics, and a&s;&s;i&s;t their operation.</P>
<P>The purging medicine to be u&s;ed in the yellow fe|ver, is the <HI>tartarum, vitriolatum chry&s;tali&s;atum,</HI> or <HI>&s;al polychre&s;tus,</HI> di&s;&s;olved in equal parts of <HI>&s;imple cin|namon</HI> and <HI>common water,</HI> or in &s;imple <HI>cinnamon-water</HI> alone. It mu&s;t be given in &s;mall do&s;es every hour, until it operates; and the patient is to dilute copiou&s;ly while it operates, with very weak chicken broth. The quantity of the &s;alt is four drachms, to &s;ix or eight ounces of water, (as much as the water will di&s;&s;olve) and the do&s;e of it may be two table &s;poonfuls. In defect of this medicine, &s;oluble tar|tar, or &s;al catharticus amarus, or manna and cream of tartar, mu&s;t be u&s;ed. But let me caution practi|tioners again&s;t adding tartar emetic, in order to quicken the operation of their medicines; which, however u&s;eful it may be in bilious di&s;ea&s;es, may be fatal in this.</P>
<P>Purging generally completes the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the fever, and carries off the vomiting; but it mu&s;t be continued while the &s;tools remain bilious, or foetid, otherwi&s;e the fever will ri&s;e, and the vomiting return.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="030041_0147_0FE41304FB40A3E0">
In ca&s;e the fever &s;till continues, the &s;tomach &s;et|tled, and the bowels well evacuated, recour&s;e mu&s;t be had to &s;udorifics: repeated do&s;es of James's pow|der, efferve&s;cent draughts, and plentifully diluting with barley-water, or balm, or mint-tea, generally &s;oon remove it.</P>
<P>An intermi&s;&s;ion being procured, bark, in &s;ub&s;tance, is immediately to be given, and repeated every hour, in drachm do&s;es, if the &s;tomach will bear it, until twelve drachms have been taken; which is generally a &s;ufficient &s;ecurity again&s;t the progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e: but it mu&s;t &s;till be continued, at longer intervals, for many days; interpo&s;ing mild cathartics, &s;uch as an infu&s;ion of rhubarb and tamarinds, with, or without a &s;mall quantity of &s;al polychre&s;t, or by keeping the body from a co&s;tive &s;tate by gly&s;ters.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd &s;tage, or <HI>metapto&s;es</HI> of this fever, which I believe will &s;eldom happen, where the preceding directions have been faithfully pur&s;ued, we mu&s;t draw a di&s;tinct line, or boundary, in the very beginning of it, and put a final period to bleeding. In this alarming &s;tate, all the &s;kill and power of phy|&s;ic mu&s;t be &s;ummoned up, and quickly too, to oppo&s;e the various breaches which the di&s;ea&s;e is now mak|ing, for the entrance of death.</P>
<P>The &s;trength now begins to fail; the pul&s;e is &s;ink|ing; the &s;uffu&s;ion of yellowne&s;s is perceived in the eyes, neck, and brea&s;t; the vomiting ince&s;&s;ant, and the &s;tomach rejects every thing that is &s;wallowed. A coldne&s;s here, not &s;ucceeded by &s;weat, or bilious di&s;charges, is almo&s;t a certain mortal &s;ymptom.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate nothing but purging can remove the vomiting, and &s;ave the patient's life. Here the cor|ruption
<PB N="148" REF="030041_0148_0FE41308A8E56BE0">
of the humours begins, and the &s;tools are acrid, corro&s;ive, and foetid, to an extraordinary degree.</P>
<P>The misfortune here is, that the &s;tomach, retain|ing nothing, without great difficulty, oppo&s;es all our attempts. The tartarum vitriolatum, or &s;al poly|chre&s;t, is a nau&s;eous medicine: but there is no other proper medicine, of which a &s;mall quantity will purge, which is the objection again&s;t tamarinds, cream of tartar, and manna; nor is there any other that I have ever found equally cooling and attenuat|ing. It mu&s;t be given; and though part of it will be returned, yet &s;ome of it will remain; and by re|peating a very &s;mall quantity every hour, &s;tools will, in time, be procured, and generally urine plentifully. If the patient have five or &s;ix &s;tools, the vomiting will cea&s;e. He mu&s;t dilute with weak chicken broth.</P>
<P>Gly&s;ters may a&s;&s;i&s;t, with warm fomentations fre|quently applied to the region of the praecordia, which &s;ometimes bring out a crop of acrid eruptions about the pit of the &s;tomach, on which the vomiting gene|rally cea&s;es; but in ca&s;e the&s;e attempts fail, the pa|tient &s;hould be put into a tepid bath, and have a bli&s;|ter applied to his back, or to the in&s;ide of his thighs, or, what is more effectual, to the region of the &s;to|mach; and a diaphoretic treatment adopted, with <HI>James's powder,</HI> in order to relieve the internal irri|tation by revul&s;ion, and enable the &s;tomach to bear purgatives, which alone can carry off the offending humours, and remove that perver&s;ion, as it were, of the peri&s;taltic motion, which is the ungovernable &s;ymptom, and, by its continuance, the mo&s;t certain|ly mortal &s;ymptom of this fever.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="030041_0149_0FE4130AD0A496F0">
As to what is called fever, there is nothing after the fir&s;t &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e that de&s;erves that name. Therefore, after the fir&s;t &s;tage, bark is always to be given, when the &s;tomach will bear it. The wor&s;t evil that generally attends the giving of bark here a little too early, is oppre&s;&s;ion and load at the &s;tomach; which, if gly&s;ters do not remove, the purgative &s;olu|tion, or a watery infu&s;ion of rhubarb, will; or the uniting &s;ome purgative medicine with the bark.</P>
<P>Sometimes, &s;oon after the fir&s;t attack of the fever, an abatement of every &s;ymptom is obtained; and tho&s;e who are not well acquainted with the pul&s;e, and the exten&s;ive evacuations this fever demands, con|clude that a remi&s;&s;ion, or an intermi&s;&s;ion, or a &s;olu|tion of the fever is decided. But when this happens before the third day, a &s;trict attention to the pul&s;e, and the excretions, will di&s;cover the deception, and &s;hew, by their di&s;agreement with tho&s;e &s;ymptoms which appear favourable, that they appear &s;o with|out a proper cau&s;e, and cannot be la&s;ting.</P>
<P>They who unfortunately make any dependence here, de&s;i&s;t from further evacuations, and proceed to giving bark, and cordial nouri&s;hment. Every body about the patient is filled with flattering hopes of his recovery. But the evacuations have been di&s;conti|nued too &s;oon, and have not been &s;ufficient to extin|gui&s;h entirely the inflammatory di&s;po&s;ition of the di&s;|ea&s;e; which, now aggravated, breaks out and rages with redoubled violence, and hurries the patient into the &s;econd &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e, and then &s;oon out of the world.</P>
<P>A yellow &s;uffu&s;ion may be either critical, or &s;ymp|tomatical. Critical, as Towne &s;uppo&s;es; but it mu&s;t
<PB N="150" REF="030041_0150_0FE4130C86329028">
be when there is a tranquil ce&s;&s;ation, without languor, of all the other &s;ymptoms, with warm per&s;piration; and &s;ymptomatical, as Hillary &s;uppo&s;es, when accom|panied with la&s;&s;itude, nau&s;ea, or vomiting, colliqua|tive &s;weats, and &s;unken pul&s;e.</P></Q>
<P><Q>Great di&s;putes have ari&s;en in this part of the di&s;|ea&s;e, concerning the application of bli&s;ters.</Q> Bli&s;|ters, however, according to Doctor Mo&s;ely, <Q>are found to be a &s;afe and powerful remedy. Natives, and long re&s;idents in the We&s;t-Indies are &s;eldom di&s;turb|ed by inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es, and bli&s;ters can &s;carcely ever be applied ami&s;s. They give a &s;timulus to the languid ve&s;&s;els, and form a drain for the acrid &s;erum of the blood, which often keep up di&s;orders from de|bility, ob&s;truction, and irritation.</Q></P>
<Q><P>If bleeding, purging, baths, and diaphoretics, do not remove the fever in its fir&s;t &s;tage:</P>
<P>If purging, baths, diaphoretics, and bli&s;ters, do not remove it in the &s;econd &s;tage:</P>
<P>If the vomiting cannot be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and the bark retained:</P>
<P>The la&s;t &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e appears with its dire|ful vomiting; which at fir&s;t has generally the ap|pearance of the grounds of coffee; then that of a &s;late colour, and then dark, thick, and grumous. The in|terior &s;urfaces of the body are oozing out blood into their cavities. Every excretion is corrupted blood.</P>
<P>I have &s;een people recover after the vomiting has re&s;embled coffee grounds, when any purgative medi|cine, united with a decoction of bark, could be made to pa&s;s downwards.</P>
<P>I &s;hould not have thought it nece&s;&s;ary to mention even the name of <HI>opium</HI> in this fever, had not Hillary
<PB N="151" REF="030041_0151_0FE4130E757EA808">
advi&s;ed it, and others ra&s;hly followed his advice in giving it, to check the vomiting in the beginning of this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>In a fever &s;o highly inflammatory, with the &s;to|mach in a con&s;tant &s;tate of inflammation, and the contents of the whole alimentary canal &s;o hot and acrid, it mu&s;t be, what I believe it often has been, a fatal medicine.</P>
<P>In regard to regimen, during the fir&s;t three or four days, thin, &s;oft, cooling drink, emul&s;ion, and chicken broth, be&s;ides the medicines, will be as much as the &s;tomach can &s;u&s;tain, even were any thing el&s;e nece&s;|&s;ary. After the cri&s;is, or after the fir&s;t &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e, panado, &s;ago, and gruel, are the mo&s;t proper articles of nouri&s;hment, with the addition of a &s;poon|ful of Madeira wine, where the patient is weak, languid, and exhau&s;ted. Wine cheri&s;hes the &s;to|mach, and acts as a cordial, mixed with the&s;e nou|ri&s;hments; but if it be given in any other way, it af|fects the head, and heats the patient. Wine, where it is nece&s;&s;ary, &s;hould be u&s;ed in the &s;ame manner in all fevers.</P></Q>

<HEAD>THE CURE OF THE REMITTENT FEVER. By JOHN HUNTER, M. D.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Observations on the Diseases of the Army in Jamaica.</NOTE></HEAD>
<Q><P>In treating of the cure of the remittent fever, I &s;hall give an account of the remedies, in the order in which they were admini&s;tered when the fever had its mo&s;t u&s;ual appearance; and &s;hall afterwards enu|merate
<PB N="152" REF="030041_0152_0FE41313A454E740">
the means that were found mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful in removing, or palliating particular &s;ymptoms, &amp;c.</P>
<P>No di&s;ea&s;e requires more &s;peedy a&s;&s;i&s;tance; for the efficacy of the medicines employed depends, in a great mea&s;ure, on their being given early.</P>
<P>If I &s;ee a patient during the fir&s;t fit, I direct an ounce of Glauber's &s;alt, or the &s;ame quantity of the bitter purging &s;alt, to be di&s;&s;olved in half a pint of water, to which two drops of the oil of peppermint being added, four table &s;poonfuls of the &s;olution are given every half hour, till it operates, or be all taken. As there is generally much &s;ickne&s;s at the &s;tomach, it is given in &s;mall do&s;es, le&s;t it &s;hould excite vomit|ing. The e&s;&s;ential oil covers the ta&s;te of the &s;alt, and renders it le&s;s offen&s;ive to the &s;tomach.</P>
<P>It is probably of no great con&s;equence, what kind of purgative medicine is given, provided it operates effectually, and without violence.</P>
<P>After a few &s;tools having been procured, the patient generally feels him&s;elf much ea&s;ier, and a remi&s;&s;ion often en&s;ues. This is to be carefully watched for, and immediate advantage is to be taken of it, for admini&s;|tering the Peruvian bark. The common do&s;e of this medicine is a drachm, which may be repeated every &s;econd hour; and as a general rule in giving it, this is perhaps the be&s;t; but both the quantity and inter|val mu&s;t often be varied, according to circum&s;tances. Where the preceding fit has been uncommonly &s;e|vere, and there is rea&s;on to fear that the &s;ucceeding one will be &s;till more violent, and where a long re|mi&s;&s;ion cannot be depended upon, the do&s;e may be in|crea&s;ed to two drachms, which may be given every hour. But few &s;tomachs will bear &s;o much, and
<PB N="153" REF="030041_0153_0FE41315512947B0">
&s;ometimes the bark cannot be given at all, in &s;ub|&s;tance. In &s;uch a ca&s;e recour&s;e mu&s;t be had to a decoction, or an infu&s;ion.</P>
<P>In &s;evere attacks of the fever, in which it is ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to watch for the remi&s;&s;ion, in order to make the be&s;t advantage of it, whenever the pul&s;e becomes a little flower, and the heat begins to abate, a do&s;e or two of the infu&s;ion may be given, and the powder added afterwards, as &s;oon as the &s;tomach will bear it. This I found the mo&s;t certain way of moderating or preventing the next paroxy&s;m.</P>
<P>The vehicle in which the bark is given, mu&s;t, in many ca&s;es, be &s;uited to the patient's &s;tomach. It will &s;ometimes &s;it ea&s;y on the &s;tomach, when mixed with coffee, with wine and water, or with wine alone, if the remi&s;&s;ion be con&s;iderable; in &s;ome ca&s;es, it an&s;wers the &s;ame purpo&s;e to mix it with milk, or with a weak infu&s;ion of camomile flowers. By the&s;e expedients the &s;tomach is reconciled to the me|dicine, is enabled to receive a larger quantity of it, and to retain it better.</P>
<P>It will &s;ometimes happen that the bark purges &s;trongly, and pa&s;&s;es through the body almo&s;t un|changed. This is not an unfavourable &s;ymptom, and the remedy is ea&s;y, for three or four drops of the <HI>tinct. thebaic.</HI> added to each do&s;e, &s;oon put a &s;top to the purging.</P>
<P>When the method of cure laid down above is carefully put in practice from the beginning, it will, in many ca&s;es, prevent a return of the fever; in ge|neral, however, a &s;ufficient quantity of bark cannot be given on the fir&s;t remi&s;&s;ion, nor is there time for it
<PB N="154" REF="030041_0154_0FE413170B1E1990">
to produce its effects upon the body, &s;o as to prevent a &s;econd paroxy&s;m.</P>
<P>The heat, re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, anxiety, and indeed all the &s;ymptoms u&s;ually accompanying the &s;econd parox|y&s;m, are more violent than in the fir&s;t, if nothing has been done in the remi&s;&s;ion to &s;top the progre&s;s of the fever; but if the length of the remi&s;&s;ion, and the &s;tate of the &s;tomach have admitted of the liberal u&s;e of the bark, it has a con&s;iderable effect upon the en|&s;uing fit. The &s;ymptoms run high, but the &s;trength of the patient appears more equal to the &s;truggle; the paroxy&s;m is &s;harp, but it is of &s;hort duration, and the remi&s;&s;ion that follows is of the complete&s;t kind.</P>
<P>The medicine that I have found mo&s;t con&s;idera|bly to relieve the &s;ymptoms during the paroxy&s;ms, and promote a remi&s;&s;ion, is James's powder. It is given in &s;mall do&s;es, &s;eldom exceeding five grains, and is repeated every three or four hours. If the &s;tomach be in an irritable &s;tate, the do&s;e is often not larger than half the quantity ju&s;t mentioned; for, as has been ob&s;erved before no &s;ymptom of the di&s;ea&s;e is more trouble&s;ome or dangerous than vomiting; in the cure, therefore, care mu&s;t be taken to avoid every thing that might induce or aggravate any tendency that way. The mo&s;t &s;alutary operation of James's powder is, either to excite a &s;weat, or gently open the body. There is &s;eldom occa&s;ion to give James's powder in the fir&s;t paroxy&s;m, that being occupied by the purgative medicine; but if the fit continues as long as forty-eight hours, and the purge has been given and produced
<PB N="155" REF="030041_0155_0FE4131913258510">
the full effect, and &s;till there is no remi&s;&s;ion, James's powder may be given in the manner ju&s;t mention|ed, and by exciting a &s;weat, or further gently open|ing the body, it promotes a remi&s;&s;ion of the fever.</P>
<P>In &s;ub&s;equent attacks, the &s;ame cour&s;e is to be followed; that is, &s;mall do&s;es of James's powder are to be given during the paroxy&s;m, and the bark in remi&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>If James's powder does not keep the body open, which it &s;eldom fails to do, laxative gly&s;ters are of u&s;e; for it is to be ob&s;erved, that one or two &s;tools in the twenty-four hours, greatly relieve the &s;ick, and promote the good effects of the bark. This is particularly the ca&s;e in the fevers &s;ub&s;equent to the rains in September and October, which are of the wor&s;t kind. In &s;uch it is frequently advanta|geous to join four or five grains of rhubarb, to each do&s;e of the bark, in order to procure two or three motions in a day.</P>
<P>I have had occa&s;ion to mention, that no &s;ymp|toms are more dangerous than violent retching and vomiting, and nothing can be more pernicious than the u&s;e of emetics in &s;uch circum&s;tances. If there be &s;ickne&s;s and vomiting at the beginning of the di&s;ea&s;e camomile-tea, or warm water, are &s;ufficient to clean&s;e the &s;tomach. If the vomiting or retch|ing &s;till continues after making u&s;e of them, which they will often do, and harra&s;s the &s;ick, even dur|ing a remi&s;&s;ion of the other &s;ymptoms, &s;aline draughts, in a &s;tate of efferve&s;cence, repeated every hour, or oftener, will frequently allay this di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ymptom. The &s;tomach is al&s;o relieved by open|ing the body, which further tends greatly to check
<PB N="156" REF="030041_0156_0FE4131E8CA117E0">
the vomiting; but as cathartic medicines would be immediately thrown up, purgative gly&s;ters are the only means that can be employed for that purpo&s;e, and it is nece&s;&s;ary &s;ometimes to repeat them &s;everal times. In this way the vomiting is often quieted, and the &s;tomach enabled to retain the bark.</P>
<P>It will &s;ometimes, however, happen, in the wor&s;t fevers, that the retchings are not abated by the effer|ve&s;cing draughts, which are them&s;elves thrown up. In &s;uch ca&s;es I have had recour&s;e to opiates, and generally with &s;ucce&s;s. From fifteen to twenty drops of the <HI>tinct. thebaic.</HI> may be added to an efferve&s;cing draught, or given in a little Bri&s;tol water, and repeated in two or three hours, accord|ing to the exigency of the &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>The vomiting being overcome, the bark mu&s;t be given with diligence, yet with caution at fir&s;t, by be|ginning with the infu&s;ion, or decoction, and adding the &s;ub&s;tance as the &s;tomach will bear it.</P>
<P>During the acce&s;&s;ion of fever there is commonly more or le&s;s of head-ach, which &s;ometimes becomes extremely violent, and greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;es the patient. A bli&s;ter, applied between the &s;houlders, &s;eldom or ever fails either to relieve, or entirely remove this &s;ymptom.</P>
<P>In the very low &s;tate that was mentioned &s;ome|times to &s;ucceed violent paroxy&s;ms, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e fevers that were attended with yellowne&s;s of the &s;kin, nothing was &s;o u&s;eful as cordials; for, though the bark was not entirely laid a&s;ide, yet the quantity the &s;tomach would bear, in any form, was &s;o &s;mall that little could be expected from it. Wine and nouri&s;hment were the be&s;t cordials.</P></Q>
<P><PB N="157" REF="030041_0157_0FE3F186E3F4E520">
The nouri&s;hment which Doctor Hunter recom|mends, con&s;i&s;ts of chicken broth, panado, &s;ago, &s;alop, thin gruels, and tea, in which bread has been &s;oaked. <Q>To all the&s;e, except the broth and tea, wine may be added, with &s;ugar and nutmeg, or any other &s;pice that is more agreeable. It is of the utmo&s;t con&s;e|quence in giving both nouri&s;hment and wine, that it be repeated often, and that only a little be &s;wallowed at a time; for the &s;tomach is ea&s;ily overloaded, and provoked to vomit.</Q></P>
<Q><P>When the &s;ick are greatly reduced, after two or more paroxy&s;ms of fever, wine and nouri&s;hment be|come more e&s;&s;ential than medicine.</P>
<P>In treating the &s;ick, I have &s;uppo&s;ed the method of cure to be put in practice from the beginning of the di&s;ea&s;e; but this cannot always be the ca&s;e, as, for various and obvious rea&s;ons, a fir&s;t, or even a &s;econd paroxy&s;m may have pa&s;&s;ed before any thing is done towards the cure. In this &s;ituation, if there be a remi&s;&s;ion, and the preceding fit has been violent, and there is rea&s;on to believe that the &s;ucceeding one will be more &s;o, it is not advi&s;able to lo&s;e three or four hours in giving an opening medicine, which mu&s;t therefore be omitted, and the bark admini&s;tered directly. In order, however, to prevent any &s;en&s;e of fulne&s;s, either in the &s;tomach or bowels, which might ari&s;e from that medicine, and likewi&s;e to pro|mote the operation of it upon the con&s;titution, &s;ome opening medicine is joined to it, &s;o as to procure three or four &s;tools in the twenty-four hours. With this view, four or five grains of rhubarb may be ad|ded to each do&s;e of the bark.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="030041_0158_0FE4132036B00BB8">
If a delirium, with a con&s;iderable degree of wild|ne&s;s and agitation, which &s;ometimes prevail during the paroxy&s;m, continue after the u&s;ual evacuations, an opiate, given in a moderate do&s;e, and repeated after two or three hours, will, in &s;ome ca&s;es, have a good effect in quieting it, and thereby promote a re|mi&s;&s;ion of the fever.</P></Q>
<P>Doctor Hunter, in his ob&s;ervations on the effect of remedies, remarks; <Q>Blood-letting well de&s;erves to be con&s;idered. In &s;uch ca&s;es as &s;eemed mo&s;t to require it, for example, where the patient was young, &s;trong, of a full habit, and lately arrived from Europe; where the pul&s;e was quick and full, the face flu&s;hed with great heat and head-ach, and all the&s;e at the begin|ning of the fever, bleeding did no good. It neither dimini&s;hed the &s;ymptoms for the time, nor procured a &s;peedier remi&s;&s;ion. I cannot &s;ay, however, that it did that mi&s;chief that has been imputed to it by &s;ome; for, provided it were a moderate quantity, it could hardly be &s;aid to produce any ill con&s;equences. But if it were copious, or repeated a &s;econd time, it was always hurtful, and rendered the recovery of the pa|tient extremely &s;low, if not attended with wor&s;e con|&s;equences. This effect it had in the inflammations of the lungs that &s;ometimes happened, in which it was nece&s;&s;ary to bleed freely. It will not be con&s;i|dered as a recommendation of bleeding to &s;ay, that there were &s;ome ca&s;es in which it did little or no harm, if u&s;ed moderately; yet &s;uch is the conclu&s;ion, to which the ob&s;ervations I had an opportunity of making lead me.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="030041_0159_0FE413222D378BD8">
IT will be recollected that I &s;et out with a re&s;olution, from which I am unwilling to depart, to make no com|ments on the doctrines, or method of cure, of tho&s;e au|thors who have written largely and learnedly on the bilious remittent fever; but I cannot forbear making a remark or two on the practice of admini&s;tering of bark. My own experience authorizes me to &s;ay, as in page 105, that I never knew it <HI>&s;afe or u&s;eful, until an entire &s;olution of the di&s;ea&s;e took place;</HI> or at lea&s;t when no &s;ymptoms of importance remained, except the <HI>con&s;e|quence</HI> of &s;evere fever, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>mere debility.</HI> That the bark is too indi&s;criminately given, and without due re|gard to the condition of the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages, cannot have e&s;caped the notice of the mo&s;t inattentive; and to me it appears evident, that in tho&s;e ca&s;es where it is given in the early &s;tages of the di&s;ea&s;e, unle&s;s it acts as a gentle purgative, it &s;eldom fails to do mi&s;chief, particu|larly if the pain be con&s;iderable in the head, or any ten&s;ion or &s;en&s;e of fulne&s;s remains in either of the larger cavities. To <HI>throw in the bark,</HI> as the phra&s;e is, after the fir&s;t ob&s;cure remi&s;&s;ions in fevers of the bi|lious &s;ort, <HI>particularly in the&s;e northern climates,</HI> is a practice, in my judgment, if not calculated to endan|ger the life, of the patient, at lea&s;t &s;uch as to protract, in many in&s;tances, the continuance of the mo&s;t formid|able &s;ymptoms. This fact is corre&s;pondent with the ob&s;ervations and experience of &s;everal practitioners of medicine in this city, who &s;tand de&s;ervedly high in their profe&s;&s;ion. The celebrated traveller Bruce, who was al&s;o a phy&s;ician, informs us, that in Ma&s;uah, on the coa&s;t of the Red Sea, a certain &s;pecies of fever prevails, which, in that country, is called <HI>nedad,</HI> and which, when it terminates fatally, is generally on the third day.

In this fever there is no remedy &s;o &s;overeign as the bark; but he po&s;itively a&s;&s;erts that it does not &s;ucceed unle&s;s <HI>it acts as a purgative.</HI></P>
<P><Q>The &s;econd or third do&s;e of the bark, (&s;ays he) if any quantity is &s;wallowed, never fails to purge; and if this evacuation is copious, the patient rarely dies, but on the contrary, his recovery is generally rapid.</Q></P>
<P>He further adds, <Q>bark, I have been told by the Spa|niards, who have been in South-America, purges al|ways when taken in their fevers. A different cli|mate, different regimen and habit of body, or exer|ci&s;e, may &s;urely &s;o far alter the operation of a drug, as to make it have a different effect in Africa to what it has in Europe. Be that as it may, &s;till I &s;ay bark is a purgative, when it is &s;ucce&s;sful in this fever,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
