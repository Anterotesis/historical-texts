<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE admirable author of the&s;e devotional pa|pers has been in high e&s;teem among the inge|nious and the polite, &s;ince &s;o many excellent fruits of her pen, both in ver&s;e and pro&s;e, have appeared in public. She was early honoured, under the feigned name of <HI>Philomela,</HI> before the world was allowed to know Mrs. <HI>Elizabeth Singer</HI> by the name drawn from her family, or that of Mrs. <HI>Rowe,</HI> which &s;he acquired by marriage.</P>
<P>Though many of her writings that were publi&s;hed in her life-time di&s;cover a pious and heavenly temper, and a warm zeal for religion and virtue; yet &s;he cho&s;e to conceal the <HI>Devotions of her heart</HI> till &s;he was got beyond the cen&s;ure and the applau&s;e of mortals. It was enough that God, whom &s;he loved with ar|dent and &s;upreme affection, was witne&s;s to all her &s;e|cret and inten&s;e breathings after him.</P>
<P>In <HI>February</HI> la&s;t he was plea&s;ed to call her out of our world, and take her to him&s;elf. Some time af|ter her decea&s;e, the&s;e manu&s;cripts were tran&s;mitted to me, all inclo&s;ed in one &s;heet of paper, and directed to me at <HI>Newington,</HI> by her own hand: In the mid&s;t of them I found her letter, which intreated me to review them and commit them to the pre&s;s. This letter I have thought nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hew the world, not &s;o much to di&s;cover my right to publi&s;h the&s;e papers, as
<PB N="viii" REF="022860_0007_0FBA9EC3BB4D0F90">
to let the reader &s;ee &s;omething more of that holy and heavenly character which &s;he maintained in an uniform manner both in life and death.</P>
<P>It is now almo&s;t thirty years ago &s;ince I was hon|oured with her acquaintance, nor could her great mode&s;ty conceal all her &s;hining graces and accom|pli&s;hments; but it is not my province to give a par|ticular account of this excellent woman, who has ble&s;&s;ed and adorned our nation and our age. I ex|pect her temper, her conduct, and her virtues will be &s;et in a ju&s;t and plea&s;ing light among the memoirs of her life, by &s;ome near relations, to whom the care of her poetical pieces and her familiar letters is com|mitted.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Devout Exerci&s;es</HI> are animated with &s;uch fire as &s;eems to &s;peak the language of holy pa&s;&s;ion, and di&s;covers them to be the dictates of her heart; and tho&s;e who were favoured with her chief intimacy will mo&s;t readily believe it. The &s;tyle, I confe&s;s, is rai&s;|ed above that of common meditation or &s;oliloquy; but let it be remembered &s;he was no common Chri&s;tian. As her virtues were &s;ublime, &s;o her genius was bright and &s;parkling, and the vivacity of her imagination had a tincture of the mu&s;e almo&s;t from her childhood. This made it natural to her to expre&s;s the inward &s;en|timents of her &s;oul in more exalted language, and to paint her own ideas in metaphor and rapture near a|kin to the diction of poe&s;y.</P>
<P>The reader will here find a &s;pirit dwelling in fle&s;h elevated into divine tran&s;ports congenial to tho&s;e of angels and unbodied minds. Her inten&s;e love to her
<PB N="ix" REF="022860_0008_0FBA9EC804EDDB28">
God kindles at every hint, and tran&s;cends the limits of mortality. I &s;carce ever met with any devotional writings which gave us an example of a &s;oul, at &s;pe|cial &s;ea&s;ons, &s;o far rai&s;ed above every thing that is not immortal and divine.</P>
<P>Yet &s;he is con&s;cious of her frailties too: She &s;ome|times confe&s;&s;es her &s;olly and her guilt in the &s;ight of God in the mo&s;t affecting language of a deep humili|ation. It is with a pathetic &s;ensibility of her weak|ne&s;s, and in the &s;tronge&s;t language of &s;elf-di&s;plicien|cy, &s;he bewails her offences again&s;t her Creator and Redeemer; and in her intervals of darkne&s;s, &s;he vents her painful complaints and mournings for the ab&s;ence of her highe&s;t and be&s;t beloved.</P>
<P>Let it be ob&s;erved, that it was much the fa&s;hion, even among &s;ome divines of eminence, in former years, to expre&s;s the fervours of devout love to our Saviour in the &s;tyle of the <HI>Song of Solomon:</HI> and I mu&s;t confe&s;s that &s;everal of my compo&s;ures in ver&s;e, written in younger life, were led by tho&s;e examples unwarily in|to this track. But if I may be permitted to &s;peak the &s;en&s;e of maturer age, I can hardly think this the happie&s;t language in which Chri&s;tians &s;hould <HI>generally</HI> di&s;cover their warm &s;entiments of religion, &s;ince the clearer and more &s;piritual revelations of the New-Te&s;tament. Yet &s;till it mu&s;t be owned, there are &s;ome &s;ouls favoured with &s;uch beatifying vi&s;its from heaven, and raptured with &s;uch a flame of divine af|fection, as more powerfully engages all animal nature in their devotions, and con&s;trains them to &s;peak their pure&s;t and mo&s;t &s;piritual exerci&s;es in &s;uch pathetic
<PB N="x" REF="022860_0009_0FBA9EC8DAAAF720">
and tender expre&s;&s;ions as may be perver&s;ely profaned by an unholy con&s;truction. And the bias and pro|pen&s;ity toward this &s;tyle is yet &s;tronger, where early impre&s;&s;ions of piety have been made on the heart by devout writings of this kind.</P>
<P>It &s;hould be remembered al&s;o, there is nothing to be found here which ri&s;es above our ideas; here are none of tho&s;e ab&s;urd and incomprehen&s;ible phra&s;es which amu&s;e the ear with &s;ounding vanity, and hold rea&s;on in &s;overeign contempt: Here are no vi&s;ionary &s;cenes of wild extravagance, no affectations of he tumid and unmeaning &s;tyle, which &s;preads a glaring confu|&s;ion over the under&s;tanding; nothing that leads the reader into the region of tho&s;e my&s;tical &s;hadows and darkne&s;s which abound in the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> writers, under the pretence of refined light and &s;ublime ec&s;tacy. Nor is the character of this ingenious author to be blemi&s;hed with any other reproaches which have been &s;ometimes ca&s;t on &s;uch &s;ort of meditations.</P>
<P>I know it hath been &s;aid, that this language of rapture addre&s;&s;ed to the Deity, is but a new track given to the flow of the &s;ofter powers, after the di&s;|appointment of &s;ome meaner love; or at lea&s;t, it is owing to the want of a proper object and opportunity to fix tho&s;e tender pa&s;&s;ions: But this cannot be al|lowed to be the ca&s;e here; for as Mrs. <HI>Rowe</HI> had been &s;ought early be &s;everal lovers, &s;o &s;he &s;pent &s;eve|ral years of younger life in the connubial &s;tate with a gentleman of &s;uch accompli&s;hments and &s;uch circum|&s;tances, that he was well fitted to be a partner of her joys and cares.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="022860_0010_0FBA9ECA59E3DA78">I know al&s;o that this &s;oft and pa&s;&s;ionate turn of religious meditation has &s;ometimes been imputed to injuries and ill-treatment in the marriage &s;tate, where|by the &s;ame affections are weaned from an unde&s;erv|ing object, and poured out in amorous language upon an object &s;upremely worthy and divine. But neither has this reproach any pretence in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e: That happy pair had &s;ouls &s;o near a-kin to each other, that they pre&s;erved an uncommon amity, and mutual &s;atisfaction, &s;o long as providence favoured him with life. It is &s;ufficiently evident, then, that in the&s;e me|ditations there is no &s;ecret panting after a mortal love in the language of devotion and piety.</P>
<P>Nor yet can it be objected, that it was any di&s;plici|ence and peevi&s;hne&s;s toward other things round about her, that taught her to expre&s;s her&s;elf with &s;uch con|tempt of the things of mortality, and all the gay and tempting &s;cenes of the pre&s;ent &s;tate: She was by no means &s;our and moro&s;e, and out of humour with the world, nor with her acquaintance that dwelt in it: She often conver&s;ed freely with the gay and the great, and was in high e&s;teem among per&s;ons of rank and honour. But honour and rank among mortals, with all the &s;cenes of gaiety and greatne&s;s, were little, de&s;|picable and forgotten things, while in her devout moments her eye and her heart were fixed on God, the &s;upreme original of all excellence and all honour.</P>
<P>In common life &s;he was affable and friendly with per&s;ons of every rank and degree; and in her latter years, as &s;he drew nearer to hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n, if &s;he avoided any thing, it was grandeur and public appearances on
<PB N="xii" REF="022860_0011_0FBA9ECBCDB6E128">
earth. But &s;he never &s;o concealed and ab&s;tracted her&s;elf from the &s;ociety of any of her fellow-crea|tures, as to de&s;pi&s;e the meane&s;t of her &s;pecies. She was ever kind and compa&s;&s;ionate to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and largely liberal to the indigent. Nor did &s;he neglect the daily duties of human life under a vain imagina|tion that &s;he moved in a higher &s;phere, and was &s;e|raphically exalted above them.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, there is nothing in the&s;e papers that can ju&s;tly &s;upport any &s;uch &s;ort of cen&s;ures, though men of corrupt minds may cover the bible it&s;elf with &s;lan|der and ridicule. Let all &s;uch readers &s;tand aloof, nor touch the&s;e &s;acred leaves, le&s;t they pollute them.</P>
<P>Though there is not one complete copy of ver&s;es among&s;t all the&s;e tran&s;ports of her &s;oul, yet &s;he ever carried with her a reli&s;h of poe&s;y even into her &s;acred retirements. Sometimes &s;he &s;prings her flight from a line or two of ver&s;e, which her memory had impre&s;&s;ed upon her heart: Sometimes from the mid&s;t of her re|ligious elevations &s;he lights down upon a few lines of &s;ome modern poet, even <HI>Herbert</HI> as well as <HI>Milton,</HI> &amp;c. though it is but &s;eldom &s;he cites their names. At other times the ver&s;es &s;eem to be the effu&s;ion of her own rapturous thoughts in &s;udden melody and metre; or at lea&s;t I know not whence the lines are copied: But &s;he mo&s;t frequently does me the honour to make u&s;e of &s;ome of my writings in ver&s;e in the&s;e holy medita|tions of her heart. Ble&s;&s;ed be that God, who has &s;o far favoured any thing my pen could produce, as to a&s;&s;i&s;t &s;o &s;ublime a devotion.</P>
<P>From the different appearance of the paper and ink
<PB N="xiii" REF="022860_0012_0FBA9ECD9A583B70">
in &s;ome of the&s;e pieces, as well as from the early tran&s;cripts of &s;everal among her friends, it is evident they were written in her younger days; others are of a much later original, though there is but one that bears a date, and that is <HI>April</HI> 30, 1735. They &s;eem to have been penned at &s;pecial &s;ea&s;ons and occa&s;ions throughout the cour&s;e of her life. A few of them bear the corrections or additions of her own pen, which di&s;covers it&s;elf by a little difference of the hand-writing.</P>
<P>Though &s;he was never tempted away from our com|mon Chri&s;tianity into the fa&s;hionable apo&s;tacies of the age, yet I am well informed from many hands, that in her latter years &s;he entered with more zeal and affection into &s;ome of the peculiar doctrines of the go&s;pel: And it is evident that &s;ome of the&s;e devotional pieces have a more evangelick turn than others, and probably mo&s;t of tho&s;e were compo&s;ed or corrected in the lat|ter part of life. The oppo&s;ition which has of late been made to &s;ome of the&s;e truths, gave occa&s;ion to her further &s;earch into them, and her zeal for them. However, I have placed the&s;e papers all as I found them pinned up in a wrapping-paper, though it is evi|dent, from plain circum&s;tances, this is not the order in which they were written, nor is that of any great importance.</P>
<P>Though the&s;e writings give us the a&s;pirations of a devout &s;oul in her holy retirements, when &s;he had no de&s;ign to pre&s;ent the public with them; yet they did not want a great deal of adju&s;tment or correction in order to &s;ee the light. The numbers and the titles
<PB N="xiv" REF="022860_0013_0FBA9ED1F75E0E98">
are added by the publi&s;her, as well as the breaks and pau&s;es, which give a &s;ort of re&s;t to the reader's mind, and make the review more ea&s;y. Here and there a too venturous flight is a little moderated; sometimes a meditation or a &s;entence is completed, which &s;eemed very imperfect, or a &s;hort line or two in&s;erted to in|troduce the &s;en&s;e where the language &s;eemed too ab|rupt or the meaning too ob&s;cure. Her &s;oul had a large &s;et of ideas in pre&s;ent view, which made every expre&s;&s;ion &s;he u&s;ed ea&s;y and per&s;picuous to her&s;elf, when &s;he wrote only for her own u&s;e; though &s;ometimes her entire &s;en&s;e might not be quite &s;o obvious to eve|ry reader without a little introduction into her track of &s;entiments: Upon the whole, I mu&s;t acknowledge I was very unwilling that this excellent work &s;hould lo&s;e any degrees of elegance or brightne&s;s by pa&s;&s;ing through my hands.</P>
<P>When the manu&s;cript came fir&s;t under my revi&s;al, I read it over with the eye of a critick and a friend, that I might publi&s;h it with honour to the hand that wrote it, and with religious entertainment and advan|tage to the world: Nor was this employment de&s;titute of its proper &s;atisfaction. But never did I feel the true plea&s;ure of the&s;e meditations, till I had fini&s;hed this labour of the <HI>head,</HI> and began to read them over again as <HI>devout exerci&s;es of the heart:</HI> Then I endeav|oured to enter more entirely into the &s;pirit of the pious author, and attempted to a&s;&s;ume her language as my own. But how much &s;uperior was the &s;atisfaction which I received from this review, e&s;pecially where|&s;oever I had rea&s;on to hope I could pronounce her
<PB N="xv" REF="022860_0014_0FBA9ED360FA6DB8">
words with &s;incerity of &s;oul. How happily did this rai&s;e and entertain all my plea&s;ing pa&s;&s;ions, and gave me another &s;ort of delight than the dry, critical peru|&s;al of them, in order to judge concerning their pro|priety? But I confe&s;s al&s;o, it was an aba&s;ing and mor|tifying thought when I found how often I was con|&s;trained to drop the &s;ublime expre&s;&s;ion from my lips, or forbid my tongue to u&s;e it, becau&s;e my own attain|ments &s;unk &s;o far beneath tho&s;e &s;acred elevations of &s;pirit, and fell &s;o far &s;hort of tho&s;e tran&s;cendent de|grees of divine affection and zeal.</P>
<P>Let me per&s;uade all that peru&s;e this book, to make the &s;ame experiment that I have done; and when they have &s;hut out the world, and are reading in their retirements, let them try how far they can &s;peak this language, and a&s;&s;ume the&s;e &s;entiments as their own: And by a&s;piring to follow them, may they find the &s;ame &s;atisfaction and delight, or at lea&s;t learn the profitable le&s;&s;ons of &s;elf aba&s;ement and holy &s;hame: And may a noble and glorious ambition excite in their brea&s;ts a &s;acred <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> emulate &s;o illu&s;trious an example. What&s;oever ardours of divine love have been kindled in a &s;oul united to fle&s;h and blood, may al&s;o be kindled by the &s;ame influences of grace in other &s;pirits, labouring under the &s;ame clogs and im|pediments.</P>
<P>But perhaps it will be nece&s;&s;ary here to give a cau|tion to &s;ome humble Chri&s;tians, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> would not make the&s;e higher elevations of piety and holy joy the te&s;t and &s;tandard by which to judge of the &s;incerity of their own religion.

&s;afe at paradi&s;e, who have not been favoured, like <HI>St. Paul,</HI> with a rapture into the third heaven, nor could ever ari&s;e to the affectionate tran&s;ports and devout joys of Mrs. <HI>Rowe;</HI> yet I hope all &s;erious readers may find &s;omething here, which, through the aids of the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, may rai&s;e them above their u&s;ual pitch, may give a new &s;pring to their religious plea&s;ures, and their immortal hopes, and thereby ren|der their lives more holy and heavenly.</P>
<P>That the publication of this little book may be favoured with the divine ble&s;&s;ing for this happy end, is the &s;incere de&s;ire and reque&s;t of the publi&s;her, as it was the real motive of the ingenious and pious writer, to commit them by my hand to the public view.

<HEAD>TO THE Reverend Dr. WATTS, at <HI>Newington.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE opinion I have of your piety and judg|ment is the rea&s;on of my giving you the trou|ble of looking over the&s;e papers, in order to publi&s;h them; which I de&s;ire you to do as &s;oon as you can conveniently; only you have full liberty to &s;uppre&s;s what you think proper.</P>
<P>I think there can be no vanity in this de&s;ign, for I am &s;en&s;ible &s;uch thoughts as the&s;e will not be for the ta&s;te of the modi&s;h part of the world; and before they appear, I &s;hall be entirely di&s;intere&s;ted in the cen&s;ure or applau&s;e of mortals.</P>
<P>The reflections were occa&s;ionally written, and only for my own improvement; but I am not without hopes that they may have the &s;ame effect on &s;ome pious minds, as the reading the experiences of others have had on my own &s;oul. The experimental part of religion has generally a greater influence than its theory; and if, when I am &s;leeping in the du&s;t, the&s;e &s;oliloquies &s;hould kindle a flame of divine love in the heart of the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t de&s;pi&s;ed Chri&s;tian, be the glory given to the great &s;pring of all grace and benignity.</P>
<P>I have now done with mortal things, and all to
<PB REF="022860_0017_0FBA9ED7DB783618">
come is va&s;t eternity&mdash;eternity&mdash;How tran&s;|porting is the &s;ound! as long as God exi&s;ts, my being and happine&s;s is &s;ecure. The&s;e unbounded de&s;ires, which the wide creation cannot limit, &s;hall be &s;atis|fied for ever. I &s;hall drink at the fountain head of plea&s;ure, and be refre&s;hed with the emanations of original life and joy. I &s;hall hear the voice of un|created harmony &s;peaking peace and ineffable con&s;o|lation to my &s;oul.</P>

<HEAD>I. Supreme Love to <HI>God.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHY, O my God, mu&s;t this mortal &s;truc|ture put &s;o great a &s;eparation between my &s;oul and thee? I am &s;urrounded with thy e&s;&s;ence, yet I cannot perceive thee?

<P>O thou, whom un&s;een, I love, by what powerful influence do&s;t thou attract my &s;oul? the eye has not &s;een, nor the ear heard, nor has it entered into the heart of man to conceive, what thou art; and yet I love thee beyond all that mine eye hath &s;een, or my ear heard, beyond all that my heart can comprehend. Thou dwelle&s;t in heights of glory, to which no hu|man thought can &s;oar, and yet thou art more near

and intimate to my &s;oul than any of the objects of &s;en&s;e. The&s;e ears have never heard thy voice, and yet I am better acquainted with thee, and can rely on thee with more confidence, than on the deare&s;t friend I have on earth.</P>
<P>My heart cleaves to thee, O Lord, as its only re|fuge, and finds in thee a &s;ecret and con&s;tant &s;pring of con&s;olation. I &s;peak to thee with the utmo&s;t confi|dence, and think thy being my greate&s;t happine&s;s. The reflection on thy exi&s;tence and greatne&s;s recre|ates my &s;pirits, and fills my heart with alacrity; my &s;oul overflows with plea&s;ure, I rejoice, I triumph in thy independent ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, and ab&s;olute dominion. Reign, O my God, for ever glorious and uncontrouled.</P>
<P>I, a worm of the earth, would join my a&s;&s;ent with the infinite orders above, with all thy flaming mini&s;|ters who rejoice in thy kingdom and glory.</P>
<L>Tho' not with them, thy happier race allow'd</L>
<L>To view the bright unveil'd divinity;</L>
<L>(By no audacious glance from mortal eyes,</L>
<L>Tho&s;e my&s;tic glories are to be profan'd)</L>
<L>But yet I feel the &s;ame immortal flame,</L>
<L>And love thee, tho' un&s;een.</L>
<P>I love thee&mdash;Thus far I can &s;peak, but all the re&s;t is unutterable; and I mu&s;t leave the plea&s;ing tale untold till I can talk in the language of immortali|ty: and then I'll begin the tran&s;porting &s;tory, which &s;hall never come to an end, but be &s;till and &s;till be|ginning: for thy beauties, O thou faire&s;t of ten

<P>I love thee, and O thou that knowe&s;t all things, read the characters that love has drawn on my heart: what excellence but thine in heaven and earth could rai&s;e &s;uch a&s;pirations of &s;oul, &s;uch &s;ublime and fervent affections as tho&s;e I feel? what could fix my &s;pirit but boundle&s;s perfection? what is there el&s;e for who&s;e &s;ake I could de&s;pi&s;e all created glory? why am I not at re&s;t here among &s;en&s;ible enjoyments? whence ari&s;e the&s;e importunate longings, the&s;e infinite de&s;ires? why does not the complete creation &s;atisfy, or at lea&s;t delude me with a dream of happine&s;s? why do not the objects of &s;en&s;e awake a more ardent &s;entiment than things di&s;tant and invi&s;ible? why &s;hould I, who <HI>&s;ay to corruption, thou art my father,</HI> a&s;pire after a union with the immen&s;e divinity?</P>
<P>You angels of God that behold his face, explain to me the &s;acred my&s;tery; tell me how this heavenly flame began, unriddle its wondrous generation: who hath animated this mortal flame with cele&s;tial fire, and given a clod of earth this divine ambition? what could kindle it but the breath of God, which kindled up my &s;oul? and to thee, its amiable original, it a&s;|cends; it breaks through all created perfection, and keeps on its re&s;tle&s;s cour&s;e to the fir&s;t pattern of beauty.</P>
<P>Ye flowery varieties of the earth, and you &s;parkling glories of the &s;kies, your blandi&s;hments are vain,

while I pur&s;ue an excellence that ca&s;ts a reproach on all your glory.

Oh! when will it di&s;per&s;e the clouds, and break out in full &s;plendor on my &s;oul?</P>
<P>But what will the open vi&s;ion of thy beauties ef|fect, if, while thou art but faintly imagined, I love thee with &s;uch a &s;acred fervour.

Thou ha&s;t uttered nothing that thou can&s;t &s;ee occa|&s;ion to alter on a &s;econd review: thou can&s;t promi&s;e nothing to thy own damage, nor be a lo&s;er by the ut|mo&s;t

<P>Nor ha&s;t thou any nece&s;&s;ity to flatter thy creatures, or to &s;ay kinder things to them than thou meane&s;t to fulfil. Mi&s;erable man can bring no advantage to thee, nor has he any thing to claim from thee. By what benefit has he prevented thee? by what right can he demand the lea&s;t of thy favours? thy engagements are all free and uncon&s;trained, founded on thy own beneficence, and not on the merits of thy creature. While I con&s;ider this, my expectations ri&s;e, I &s;et no limits to my hopes: I look up with confidence, and call thee <HI>my Father,</HI> and with a humble faith, I claim every advantage that tender name imports. My heart confides in thee with &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s and alacrity; fear and di&s;tru&s;t are incon&s;i&s;tent with my thoughts of the beneficence of thy nature.</P>
<P>Every name and attribute by which thou ha&s;t re|vealed thy&s;elf to man confirms my faith. Thy life, thy being, is engaged: I may as well que&s;tion thy exi&s;tence, as thy faithfulne&s;s: as &s;ure as thou art, thou art ju&s;t and true. The prote&s;tation of the mo&s;t faithful friend I have, cannot give me half the con&s;o|lation that thy promi&s;es give me. I hear vain man with diffidence, I bid my &s;oul beware of tru&s;ting a fal&s;e mortality; but I hear thy voice with joy and full a&s;|&s;urance.</P>

<P>Should I drink my fill, tho&s;e fountains are &s;till ex|hau&s;tle&s;s; millions of happy &s;ouls quench their infinite de&s;ires there: millions of happy orders of beings gaze on thy beauty, and are made partakers of thy ble&s;&s;ed|ne&s;s; but thou art &s;till undimini&s;hed.

<P>OH! let not the Lord be angry, and I who am but du&s;t will &s;peak! Why do&s;t thou withdraw thy&s;elf, and &s;uffer me to pur&s;ue thee in vain? If I am &s;urrounded with thy immen&s;ity, why am I thus in|&s;en&s;ible of thee? Why do I not find thee, if thou art every where pre&s;ent? I &s;earch thee in the temple, where thou ha&s;t often met me; there I have &s;een the traces of thy maje&s;ty and beauty; but tho&s;e &s;acred vi&s;ions ble&s;s my &s;ight no more. I &s;earch thee in my &s;ecret retirements, where I have called upon thy name, and have often heard the whi&s;pers of thy voice; that cele&s;tial conver&s;ation hath often reached and raptured my &s;oul, but I am &s;olaced no more with tho&s;e divine conde&s;cen&s;ions; I li&s;ten, but I hear tho&s;e gentle &s;ounds no more; I pine and langui&s;h, but thou flie&s;t me; &s;till I wither in thy ab&s;ence, as a drooping plant for the reviving &s;un.</P>
<P>O when wilt thou &s;catter this melancholy darkne&s;s? When &s;hall the &s;hadows flee before thee? When &s;hall
<PB N="67" REF="022860_0066_0FBA9F3DD81FFAC8">
the cheerful glory of thy grace dawn upon my mind at thy approach? I &s;hall revive at thy light? my vital &s;pirits will confe&s;s thy pre&s;ence; grief and anxiety will vani&s;h before thee, and immortal joys &s;urround my &s;oul.</P>
<P>Where thou art pre&s;ent, heaven and happine&s;s en|&s;ue; hell and damnation fill the brea&s;t where thou art ab&s;ent.

<P>Tell me not of glory and plea&s;ure, there are no &s;uch things without my God; while he withdraws, what delight can the&s;e trifles afford? All that amu&s;es man|kind, are but dreams of happine&s;s, &s;hades and fanta&s;|tic appearances: What compen&s;ation can they make for an infinite good departed? All nature cannot re|pair my lo&s;s: Heaven and earth would offer their trea&s;ures in vain; not all the kingdoms of this world, nor the thrones of archangels, could give me a recom|pence for an ab&s;ent God.</P>

My &s;pirits fail at the &s;uppo&s;ition; I cannot face the dreadful apprehen&s;ions of my God for ever gone. Is it not hell in its mo&s;t horrid pro&s;pect? eternal darkne&s;s, and the undying worm, infinite ruin and irreparable dam|age? Compared to this, what were all the plagues that earth could threaten, or hell invent? what is di&s;grace, and poverty, and pain? what is all that mor|tals fear, real or imaginary evils? they are nothing compared to the terrors which the thought of lo&s;ing my God excites.</P>
<P>O thou, who art my boundle&s;s trea&s;ure, my infinite delight, my all, my ineffable portion, can I part with thee? I may &s;ee without light, and breathe without air, &s;ooner than be ble&s;&s;ed without my God.

Thou art infinitely ble&s;&s;ed in thy&s;elf, thy glory admits of no addition; the prai&s;es of angels cannot heighten thy happine&s;s, nor the bla&s;phemies of hell dimini&s;h it. Thou can&s;t do every thing, and thy power finds no ob&s;tacle. <HI>Thou made&s;t heaven and

earth, the &s;ea and the fountains of water; thou do&s;t ac|cording to thy will in the armies of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth; thou holde&s;t the waters in the hol|low of thy hand, and mea&s;ure&s;t out the heavens with a &s;pan: Thou comprehende&s;t the du&s;t of the earth in a mea|&s;ure, and weighe&s;t the mountains in &s;cales, and the hills in a balance: Thou covere&s;t thy&s;elf with light, as with a gar|ment,</HI> and art &s;urrounded with inacce&s;&s;ible &s;plendor: <HI>Thou art glorious in holine&s;s, fearful in prai&s;es; the hea|vens are not clean in thy &s;ight; but thou charge&s;t thine an|gels with folly: What then is man, that drinks in iniquity like water? What is man, that thou art mindful of him; or the &s;on of man, that thou do&s;t thus vi&s;it him?</HI> It is be|cau&s;e thou art good, and thy mercy endureth for ever; mercy is thy prevailing attribute. Thou art compa&s;|&s;ionate, and infinitely gracious, and ha&s;t fully mani|fe&s;ted thy love and beneficence to the race of man in the glorious methods of our redemption from everla&s;t|ing bondage and death by thy &s;on Je&s;us.</P>
<P>Therefore with the lowe&s;t reverence, and mo&s;t hum|ble gratitude, I de&s;ire to pro&s;trate my&s;elf before thee, acknowledging it my greate&s;t honour, and unde&s;erved privilege, to approach the Lord, and bow my&s;elf be|fore the high God; I that am unworthy to utter thy tremendous name, or once to lift up my eyes to hea|ven.

but what would carry in it my own condemnation.

<P>But &s;till tho&s;e very circum&s;tances that aggravate my guilt, exalt thy mercy; here the freene&s;s and magnificence of thy grace will di&s;play it&s;elf; here thou wilt an&s;wer the indulgent title of a father in its tendere&s;t extent; I have no &s;ins too great for infinite clemency to pardon.

<L>'TIS no mean beauty of the ground</L>

<L>I &s;aint beneath a nobler wound,</L>
<L>Nor love below the &s;kies.</L>
<P>If words can reach the heights of love and gra|titude, let me pour out the &s;ecret ardour of my &s;oul; O let it not offend thy greatne&s;s, that du&s;t and vanity adores and loves thee. If thou had&s;t given me other capacities, and formed any thing more &s;uitable to my wi&s;hes, I might have found a lower happine&s;s, and been content with &s;omething below the infinite Deity; but the &s;canty creation affords nothing to &s;atisfy me, and I follow thee by a divine in&s;tinct and mere nece&s;|&s;ity of nature.</P>
<P>My life is u&s;ele&s;s, and my being in&s;ignificant with|out thee: My rea&s;on has no proper employment; love, the noble&s;t pa&s;&s;ion of my &s;oul, has no object to an&s;wer its dignity.

There can be no reparation made for an infinite lo&s;s; nothing can be in&s;tead of God to my &s;oul.</P>

indifference, compared to my love for thee: and it grows into hatred when that object &s;tands as thy ri|val or competitor. This is the conquering, the &s;u|perior flame that draws in and &s;wallows up all the other ardours of my nature. My engagements with all terre&s;trial things are broken; the names of father, of brother, or of friend, are no more: ab&s;tracted from thee, the&s;e tender titles give me neither confi|dence, nor joy, and are mere in&s;ignificant names, but as thou do&s;t give them an empha&s;is; they are nothing at all without thee; and with thee, what finite good can be an addition?</P>
<L>The &s;oul can hold no more, for God is all,</L>
<L>He only equals its capacious gra&s;p,</L>
<L>He only overfills to &s;paces infinite.</L>
<P>Thou art my God, and I have enough; my &s;oul is &s;atisfied, I am entirely at re&s;t.

Rectify the di&s;orders &s;in has made in my &s;oul, and renew thy image there; let me be &s;atis|fied with thy likene&s;s.

<P>Permit me to be importunate here, O ble&s;&s;ed God, and grant the importunity of my wi&s;hes; let me be fa|voured with a gracious and &s;peedy an&s;wer, for I am dying while I am &s;peaking: The very breath with which I am calling upon thee, is carrying away a part of my life: This tongue, that is now invoking thee, mu&s;t &s;hortly be &s;ilent in the grave: The&s;e knees, that are bent to pay thee homage, and the&s;e hands, that are now lifted to the mo&s;t high God for mercy, mu&s;t &s;hortly be mouldering to their original du&s;t: The&s;e eyes will &s;oon be clo&s;ed in death, which are now look|ing up to thy throne for a ble&s;&s;ing.

<HEAD>APRIL 30, 1735. XXXV. <HI>A Review of divine Mercy and Faithfulne&s;s.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I AM now &s;etting to my &s;eal that God is true, and leaving this as my la&s;t te&s;timony to the divine ve|racity. I can from numerous experiences a&s;&s;ert his faithfulne&s;s, and witne&s;s to the certainly of his pro|mi&s;es. <HI>The word of the Lord is tried, and he is a buck|ler to all tho&s;e that put their tru&s;t in him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>O come, all you that fear the Lord, and I will tell you what he has done for my &s;oul; I will a&s;cribe righteou&s;|ne&s;s to my Maker,</HI> and leave my record for a people yet unborn; that the generation to come may ri&s;e up and prai&s;e him.</P>
<P>Into whatever di&s;tre&s;s his wi&s;e providence has brought me, I have called on the Lord, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears; I tru&s;ted in God, and he &s;aved me. Oh! let my experience &s;tand
<PB N="125" REF="022860_0124_0FBA9E16567392E8">
a witne&s;s to them that hope in his mercy; let it be to the Lord for a prai&s;e and a glory.</P>
<P>I know not where to begin the recital of thy nume|rous favours. Thou ha&s;t hid me in the &s;ecret of thy pavilion, from the pride of man, and from the &s;trife of tongues, when by a thou&s;and follies I have merited reproach: Thou ha&s;t graciou&s;ly protected me, when the vanity of my friends, or the malice of my ene|mies, might have &s;tained my reputation: Thou ha&s;t covered me with thy feathers, and under thy wings have I tru&s;ted: Thy truth has been my &s;hield and my buckler; the thee I owe the ble&s;&s;ing of a clear and unblemi&s;hed name, and not my own conduct, nor the partiality of my friends.&mdash;Glory be to thee, O Lord.</P>
<P>Thou ha&s;t led me through a thou&s;and labyrinths, and enlightened my darkne&s;s. When &s;hades and per|plexity &s;urrounded me, my light has broke forth out of ob&s;curity, and my darkne&s;s been turned into noon|day. Thou ha&s;t been a guide and a father to me. When I knew not where to a&s;k advice, thou ha&s;t given me unerring coun&s;el: <HI>The &s;ecret of the Lord has been with</HI> me, and he <HI>has &s;hewn me his covenant.</HI></P>
<P>In how many &s;een and un&s;een dangers ha&s;t thou delivered me? How narrow my gratitude? How wide thy mercy? How innumerable are thy thoughts of love? How infinite the in&s;tances of thy goodne&s;s? How high above the ways and thoughts of man?</P>
<P>How often ha&s;t thou &s;upplied my wants, and by thy bounty confounded my unbelief? Thy benefits have &s;urprized and ju&s;tly reproached my diffidence;
<PB N="126" REF="022860_0125_0FBA9E17D1924E68">
my faith has often failed, but thy goodne&s;s has never failed. The world and all its flatteries have failed, my own heart and hopes have failed, but thy mercy endures for ever, thy faithfulne&s;s has never failed.</P>
<P>The &s;trength of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> has never deceived me, nor made me a&s;hamed of my confidence. Thou ha&s;t never been as a deceitful brook, or as waters that fail, to my &s;oul.</P>
<P>In loving kindne&s;s, in truth, and in very faithful|ne&s;s, thou ha&s;t afflicted me: Oh! how unwillingly ha&s;t thou &s;eemed to grieve me? With how much in|dulgence has the puni&s;hment been mixed? Love has appeared through the di&s;gui&s;e of every frown: Its beams have glimmered through the darke&s;t night; by every affliction thou ha&s;t been &s;till drawing me nearer to thy&s;elf, and removing my carnal props, that I may lean with more a&s;&s;urance on the eternal rock.</P>
<P>Thy love has been my leading glory from the fir&s;t intricate &s;teps of life: The fir&s;t unde&s;igning paths I trod were marked and guarded by the vigilance of thy love: Oh! whither el&s;e had my &s;in and folly led me?</P>
<P>How often have I tried and experienced thy cle|mency, and found an immediate an&s;wer to my prayers? Thou ha&s;t often literally fulfilled thy word: I have a fre&s;h in&s;tance of thy faithfulne&s;s again: Thou ha&s;t made me triumph in thy goodne&s;s, and given a new te&s;timony to the veracity of thy promi&s;es.</P>
<P>And after all, what ingratitude, what in&s;en&s;ibility reigns in my heart! Oh! cancel it by the blood of the covenant: Root out this mon&s;trous infidelity that &s;till returns after the fulle&s;t evidence of thy truth.
<PB N="127" REF="022860_0126_0FBA9E1B43CECAE0">
Thou ha&s;t graciou&s;ly conde&s;cended to an&s;wer me in my own time and way, and yet I am again doubting thy faithfulne&s;s and care. <HI>Lord,</HI> pity me, <HI>I believe, O help my unbelief.</HI> Go on to &s;uccour, go on to par|don, and at la&s;t conquer my diffidence.

<P>While I have memory and thought, let his good|ne&s;s dwell on my &s;oul. Let me not forget the depth of my di&s;tre&s;s, the angui&s;h and importunity of my vows: When every human help failed, and all was darkne&s;s and perplexity, then God was all my &s;tay. Then I knew no name but his, and he alone knew my &s;oul in adver&s;ity. Ble&s;s the Lord, O my &s;oul, and forget not all his benefits.</P>

<L>My King, and God of love;</L>
<L>My work and joy &s;hall be the &s;ame</L>

<P>I have yet a thou&s;and, and ten thou&s;and deliver|ances to recount, ten thou&s;and una&s;ked-for mercies to recal: No moment of my life has been de&s;titute of thy care, no accident has found me unguarded by thy watchful eye, or neglected by thy providence.
