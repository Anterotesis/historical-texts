<P>_ALTHOUGH unhappy man, while under the prevalency of his native ta&s;te and di&s;|po&s;ition, is contrary to God, and di&s;affected to his character and government; yet to well-di&s;po&s;ed mind, there appears the greate&s;t beauty, wi&s;dom and excellency in the divine conduct. The con&s;ummate work of providence, and the moral government of the world, are the ways in which the divine character is made manife&s;t. But how little &s;oever, the calm, uniform cour&s;e of provi|dence, may affect the carele&s;s and inattentive; yet a &s;eries of &s;uch alarming events, as we &s;ee in the&s;e years, (the divine patronage of rights and liberty, together

with the &s;urpri&s;ing &s;teps by which this noble cau&s;e has been re&s;cued, even to this day,) &s;tand as a convincing proof of the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of the divine go|vernment; which may well &s;erve to fix the re&s;olution of every &s;ober mind, to tru&s;t in the Lord of Ho&s;ts;&mdash;well might David &s;ay, <Q>The Lord reigns, let the earth rejoice.</Q> A &s;acred regard to the Deity, with &s;uch religious &s;entiments, as rea&s;on aided by revelation will approve, cannot fail of producing the happie&s;t fruits in life, and laying a &s;olid foundation for ble&s;&s;ed|ne&s;s in the future world.&mdash;How great is the folly of &s;uch as &s;ay unto God, <Q>Depart from us, for we de|&s;ire not the knowledge of thy ways?</Q> Whether we con&s;ider our&s;elves as members of civil or religious &s;ocieties&mdash;religion, in its happy fruits, will effect har|mony, good order and loyalty. Since we are called to act our part, in various characters and capacities in life; and pure benevolence (in which true virtue con|&s;i&s;ts) mu&s;t be the leading principle; what can better become us, or form a more la&s;ting foundation for u&s;e|fulne&s;s, than a diligent and faithful attendance on the duties of our calling?&mdash;<Q>Wherein a man is called, therein let him abide faithfully with God.</Q> A due attendance on per&s;onal duties, mu&s;t render men zealous wor&s;hippers of God, and followers of the lamb; how|ever dignified or depre&s;&s;ed among men. And the like attention to relative duties, mu&s;t exemplify ju&s;tice, temperance, cha&s;tity, benevolence, and every &s;ocial vir|tue:&mdash;How would &s;uch a lovely conduct, garni&s;h the body politick, adorn every &s;ociety, and happify the humane race? The apo&s;tle directs to the like conduct,

Rom. 12.6, 7, 8. <HI>Having gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophe&s;y, let us prophe&s;y according to the proportion of faith, or mini&s;try, let us wait on our mini&s;tring; or he that teacheth, on teaching; or he that exhorteth, on exhortation; he that giveth, let him do it with &s;implicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that &s;heweth mercy, with chearfulne&s;s.</HI> And &s;ince no gifts are granted, no talents betru&s;ted with us, but what are de&s;igned for improvement, to good and valuable purpo&s;es; care mu&s;t be exerci&s;ed, that none be neglected or ba&s;ely perverted.&mdash;In order to which, it &s;eems needful that men well under&s;tand the duty of their re&s;pective relations, &mdash; the nature and extent of the offices and capacities they &s;u&s;tain,&mdash; lea&s;t &s;ome precious talent be neglected, or fair opportunity of doing good be left unimproved; or our brother's province be tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed upon. Irregular and inordinate &s;elf-love, and private intere&s;t, have &s;o much the domi|nion in the heart, and &s;o various is the ta&s;te and tem|pers of men, that unle&s;s true benevolence, and public &s;pirit prevent, there is eminent danger that private intere&s;t will be pur&s;ued, at the expence, or built on the ruins of the public weal. It well becomes members of com|munities to remember, that then do they be&s;t &s;erve their own intere&s;t, when in proper ways they befriend the public good. But among proud, depraved, apo&s;tate creatures, what happy expedient can be found, to bring this to pa&s;s? We enjoy all the glorious privileges of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t; and all imaginable civil privile|ges; the free&s;t &s;tate, and happie&s;t con&s;titution; (which heaven grant to the la&s;t po&s;terity:) Yet all prove

ineffectual to tho&s;e glorious purpo&s;es.&mdash; Alas! how is the go&s;pel abu&s;ed! the civil &s;word de&s;pi&s;ed; our liber|ties and privileges perverted; our public weal ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">red, and God provoked to jealou&s;y? Hence public calami|ties, and wa&s;ting judgments are threatned. Can there be a &s;afe refuge, a &s;overeign remedy pre&s;cribed? I pre|&s;ume, men who will act the mo&s;t friendly part to them|&s;elves or the public, will gladly embrace it.</P>
<P>Now this is pre&s;ented in the words to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P>IN which the pious prince per&s;onates wi&s;dom.&mdash;By which (he being his own expo&s;itor) we are to under|&s;tand the fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>WISDOM here may be taken for Chri&s;t, who is the wi&s;dom of God, and the power of God, crying aloud to man, by the prophets, and apo&s;tles, his word, and providence. Or it may be taken for the benefits of his purcha&s;e appli|ed: which in a word, implies the being, and happy fruits of true religion. Now this is recommended to us, by its pre|cious qualities, enriching tendency, and happifying fruits. For by me kings reign, and princes decree ju&s;tice. By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the Earth. Riches and honour are with me, yea durable riches and righteou&s;ne&s;s: My fruit is better than gold, and my revenue than choice &s;ilver. Worthy of the highe&s;t e&s;teem, of the mo&s;t honourable, while the meane&s;t pea&s;ant is bid welcome to intimacy with it.</P>
<P>HENCE agreeable to the words of Solomon, and this &s;olemn occa&s;ion; I &s;hall attempt to exhibit to view, the
<PB N="9" REF="010354_0008_0F7EA240231A5BD0">
excellent nature, the happy tendency, <HI>and lovely fruits, of true religion.</HI></P>
<P>EVERY cau&s;e is be&s;t known by its effects: the tree by its fruits; and the excellent nature and tendency of true religion, by its revenues. Now the&s;e are more precious than gold; yea than much fine gold. True wi&s;dom mu&s;t be mo&s;t excellent and enriching, which produceth &s;uch fruits, and entitles to &s;uch revenues. It betrays a degenerate &s;oul, ignorant both of the &s;cripture and the power of God, to place it in the products of nature, or empty imagination, dry jejune external morality, or in an empty profe&s;&s;ion, crying Lord, Lord, or yet in a firm per&s;wa&s;ion, and &s;elf-exalting confidence, that hea|ven is our own. The efforts of nature (depraved as it is) can never produce this pearl of great price. Shall we (while we can exerci&s;e rea&s;on, or &s;ee by the light of revelation) ever be induced to believe, that the heaven-born &s;oul, who is taught of God, and formed after the divine image, and made an heir of God, and joint-heir with Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;hall in no re&s;pects excel <HI>Seneca,</HI> or &s;urpa&s;s the grovelling low-lifed phari&s;ee? God forbid that the glorious go&s;pel of grace &s;hould be perverted, and pro&s;tituted to the vile&s;t purpo&s;es! even to elate the pride of the heart, magnify &s;elf-&s;ufficiency, and di&s;honour the divine Redeemer.</P>
<P>THE religion of the go&s;pel, the wi&s;dom which is true and genuine, &s;hall be recommended; not by the needle&s;s u&s;e of panegyricks and high encomiums; but merely by expo&s;ing its native beauties, and attractive charms. It is well known, by all acquainted with it, to be of a divine nature, and original, con&s;i&s;ting in a
<PB N="10" REF="010354_0009_0F7EA2422C569DD0">
real efflux, and communication from God; forming a new and divine nature and principle of life, in the &s;oul; conforming the mind, as to its temper, ends and intere&s;t, to the moral image of God. It con&s;i&s;ts in undefiling and purifying the heart: undoing what &s;in has done: &s;o that we come to have the &s;ame mind in us which was al&s;o in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. In the truly gra|cious &s;oul, the divine Spirit not only acts upon, or in an ineffable manner influences, but communicates of his own nature, to the &s;oul; &s;o that we are made partakers of his holine&s;s.&mdash;Which &s;ummarily con&s;i&s;ts in benevolence:&mdash;a new &s;piritual &s;en&s;e and ta&s;te is for|med in the &s;oul, which lays a happy foundation for real delight, true and &s;ub&s;tantial plea&s;ure; in plea&s;ing God, and communing with him. Pride, lu&s;ts, and impure de&s;ires, are all mortified; the &s;oul commenceth new life, acts from a new nature, from new motives, and to new ends. In a word, the &s;oul is (to u&s;e the apo&s;tle's words) created a new in Chri&s;t Je&s;us: all old things are done away; all things are become new. The &s;ame faculties phy&s;ically con&s;idered remain, but are morally changed. By which means the right object of full contentment, is found: in which the &s;oul centers, the will fixes, and the affections terminate; for which I appeal to the &s;acred volume, P&s;al. 73.25. <HI>Whom have I in heaven but thee, and there is none upon the earth I de&s;ire be&s;ide thee.&mdash;Except ye are led by the Spirit of Chri&s;t, ye are none of his.</HI> Hereby the &s;oul is rai&s;ed to its proper dignity, employed in its proper exerci&s;e, and &s;atisfied with its proper object. So Chri&s;t intimates to the woman of Samaria. <HI>He that drinketh of the water I &s;hall give him, &s;hall never thir&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="010354_0010_0F7EA242EBC9AFB0">
BUT peradventure it would be more agreeable, to dwell upon the ble&s;&s;ed tendency, and happy fruits of real grace. But however plea&s;ing the attempt may be, it openeth &s;o large a field, I may take but a partial &s;urvey. Here it maybe ob&s;erved; that if divine grace conforms the &s;oul to God, and &s;ubdues whatever is con|trary to the divine will, the con&s;equence will be, whatever the &s;oul finds to be the divine plea&s;ure, (&s;o far as it is of a gracious ta&s;te) it &s;tands ready, in a free, voluntary manner, to comport with, in practice; from the tendency of a divine principle. No longer is it led by a &s;ervile mercenary &s;pirit: neither by &s;lavi&s;h fears of penal evil, or hopes of honour among men: not the force of law, &s;o much as divine love, inclines the heart to obedience. True religion effects a lovely har|mony, between di&s;po&s;ition and duty. <Q>If ye love me keep my commandments.</Q></P>
<P>MEN may abound in external duty, and remain utter &s;trangers to the &s;pirit of true obedience. If there be no divine principle there can be no divine fruits. But to the happy men, who are replenished with true wi&s;dom; the ways of wi&s;dom are ways of plea&s;ant|ne&s;s, and all her paths are peace. This lays a happy foundation for undi&s;turbed peace; it calms every ri&s;ing &s;torm. Great peace have tho&s;e who love thy law: it admi|ni&s;ters &s;oul-&s;upporting cordials in days of adver&s;ity.&mdash;When we are fed with its bread, and the waters of affliction are wrung out to us: do we &s;ee dark and threatning &s;torms ari&s;e; are we threatned with the lo&s;s of liberty, with &s;ervitude, va&s;&s;allage and &s;lavery? is the rod of oppre&s;&s;ion ready to fall upon us, and
<PB N="12" REF="010354_0011_0F7EA2434D11B018">
are we alarm'd with fears of evil, more to be dreaded than death? are our be&s;t days placed behind us, that we mu&s;t look back to behold them? ah, lamentable &s;tate! the bitter fruit of our own folly.</P>
<P>BUT is there no &s;oothing con&s;ideration? is there no balm in Gilead?&mdash;The holy &s;oul, directed by heavenly wi&s;dom, may take &s;anctuary in God; abide under the &s;hadow of the Almighty. Yea dwell in the &s;ecret place of the mo&s;t high; where no &s;torms can approach us, or &s;orrows over-whelm us:&mdash;Or while the holy &s;oul &s;urveys Zion's troubles, and beholds her whom he can never forget, all clad in &s;able attire, as wounded, pro&s;trate on the earth, complaining that iniquity abounds, and the love of many waxes cold: that the body of Chri&s;t is rent, the church divided and di&s;turbed, and the mini&s;tration of the word and ordinances of God bla&s;ted; the dues of heaven witholden, and profanity abounding; yea the awful declen&s;ion and apo&s;tacy of the times; what an a&s;toni&s;hing change in the &s;tate of religious affairs within a quarter of a century? Here indeed the good man will drop a tear, and &s;igh bitterly. But yet it comforts his heart that the Lord reigns, who is his rock and fortre&s;s; that he pur&s;ueth the wi&s;e&s;t plan, and will yet comfort Zion, and bring light out of darkne&s;s, and direct every event to accompli&s;h the benevolent purpo&s;es of his heart.</P>
<P>DIVINE grace makes the &s;oul patient in tribulation, humble in pro&s;perity, and fruitful in every good work; prepares it for death, and brings it finally to glory.</P>
<P>How happy a man is the &s;incere chri&s;tian, who&s;e character implies every per&s;onal, &s;ocial, and religious
<PB N="13" REF="010354_0012_0F7EA243F9DA3DE0">
worth? For what&s;oever things are pure, lovely, or of good report, all are included in that grand and noble aggregate, The real chri&s;tian! Let us all learn to make a &s;acrifice of every wi&s;h, when it RUNS COUNTER TO THE DIVINE PLEASURE.</P>
<P>BUT we may further pur&s;ue the plea&s;ing pro&s;pect, while we con&s;ider the happy tendency of vital piety, to heal the maladies, and rectify the di&s;orders of the church of Chri&s;t, in its pre&s;ent militant &s;tate.</P>
<P>As religious &s;ocieties, bound in covenant to wor|&s;hip and walk with God, our fir&s;t and prime concern is with religion: that we pay our vows, and carefully imitate the example of Chri&s;t: that we love God, in a di&s;intere&s;ted and &s;uperlative manner, and our neigh|bour as our &s;elves: and thus to do, is but to yield to, and follow the dictates of true wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>BROTHERLY love is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the character of a real di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t, that the apo&s;tle &s;aith, it was needle&s;s for him to write to the church about it; for ye are taught of God to love one another. How would this beautify the church; heal all our divi&s;ions; cool the heats, and calm the tempers of bigotted zealots; who&s;e zeal is heat, without light; a flow of pa&s;&s;ions, without the light of rea&s;on or revelation to direct them? Had wi&s;dom its proper a&s;cendency, how would con|trover&s;ies cea&s;e, and profe&s;&s;ors appear more &s;olicitous to &s;ee that they are &s;ound in the faith, than to prove their brother heterodox, or bla&s;t their neighbour's character.</P>
<P>AGAIN, let us attend to the fruit of wi&s;dom, as it tends to happify the civil &s;tate. I am far from beli|eving
<PB N="14" REF="010354_0013_0F7EA244C4F8EF18">
that dominion is founded in grace, that the fear of the Lord intitles men to right, and authority to rule: though its fruits are more precious than gold, and its revenues than choice &s;ilver, civil power over the bodies and properties of men is never to be reckoned among them.</P>
<P>DOMINION, or right to rule, is evidently founded neither in nature or grace, but compact, and confe|deration: antecedent whereto, one has no better right to rule than another. He that is born of God, is become &s;ubject to the King of kings: but has never the more power over his fellow creatures. Chri&s;t tells us, his kingdom is not of this world. Though di|vine grace is an excellent qualification in him that rules, it is not that in which right to rule is founded. Property is founded in nature: what is my property can never be the property of another man, &s;o long as it remains mine. None can have right to take po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of another's property, but by merit or compact, and when in either of the&s;e methods, what was one man's property becomes another's due, it cea&s;eth to be his, and becomes the property of another. When we con&s;ider our &s;elve as confederate &s;ociety, &s;o much of per&s;onal property as is nece&s;&s;ary for the good&punc; of the community, becomes due to the public, and &s;uch as are intere&s;ted with the public weal, have right to demand the public dues; and no man is impoveri&s;hed or injured by it: but then this mu&s;t be done agree|able to the general rules by which the &s;ociety or com|munity is con&s;tituted, and its conveniency and real good is &s;ecured: otherwi&s;e the con&s;titution is violated.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="010354_0014_0F7EA2456AEB07B0">
&mdash;But who &s;hall judge in the ca&s;e, or whether per&s;ons are holden to obey, when the ca&s;e is apparent, I refer to &s;tate politicians to determine. But thus far I may venture to &s;ay, That no man ought to con&s;ider him&s;elf holden by confederation, to di&s;bur&s;t property to the known injury of the public, or the &s;ubver&s;ion of the con&s;titution: and whenever demands are made under &s;uch circum&s;tances, (which God grant may never be, till the &s;un become black as &s;ackcloth, and the moon as blood) let &s;uch as love &s;lavery, hate the con&s;titu|tion, and delight in public ruin, plead for the doctrine of pa&s;&s;ive obedience, and non-re&s;i&s;tance. What are the rules and maxims of the Engli&s;h free government, the contents of magna charta, the &s;pecial grants in colony charters, together with what mea&s;ures of admini&s;tration are incon&s;i&s;tent and &s;ubver&s;ive, has been repeatedly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in a public way.</P>
<P>MEN are naturally inclined to form them&s;elves into &s;ociety, and very great are the benefits of &s;o doing: without which, neither life or property would be &s;afe. He who &s;hares in the benefits of civil &s;ociety and government, is confederate, and bound to obey authority. And the authority of God takes place, and good con&s;cience require us to keep the peace, and &s;ub|mit to proper authority, &s;o long as the de&s;ign of government is inviolate. Rulers are mini&s;ters of God, for good: He that re&s;i&s;teth the power, re&s;i&s;ts the ordinance of God. And thus viewing the ca&s;e, reli|gion has much to do with the civil &s;tate; and is nece&s;&s;ary to its well being. And accordingly the go&s;pel injoins upon us obedience to the civil magi&s;trate, and exhibits
<PB N="16" REF="010354_0015_0F7EA2463112B2C8">
the true motives thereto. Hi&s;tory informs us, that hea|then &s;tates have found a nece&s;&s;ity to u&s;e the religious doctrine of a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hment: though they (as modern free-thinkers &s;ugge&s;t of the chri&s;tian magi&s;trate) u&s;ed it only as &s;tate policy. Perhaps there never was a &s;tate managed with decorum without it; unle&s;s a mere theocracy: and perhaps this exception is needle&s;s: &s;uch dominion has &s;in in the heart; and &s;uch is the power of pride, and the impetuo&s;ity of lu&s;ts, and &s;o are men in love with &s;upremacy, that had they nothing to fear but whips, fines, and impri&s;on|ment, they would not by the&s;e be re&s;trained from atrocious and horrid outrage: of this we can no longer doubt, who &s;ee what blackened, inhumane deeds are committed among us, who enjoy both the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, a chri&s;tian magi&s;tracy, and the greate&s;t civil privileges, and the be&s;t body of laws. If there be not &s;omething internal, all external mea&s;ures will prove ineffectual.</P>
<P>BUT may I hope for your patience, while we further view the ble&s;&s;ed tendency of vital piety to happify the civil &s;tate? in that it would directly tend to curtail and moderate the abounding extravagancy of the pre&s;ent age. Whatever is expended, not for decency, health, or duty, but to gratify pride, and a modi&s;h ta&s;te, &s;erves to impoveri&s;h the &s;tate, to beggar families, and multiply bankrupts, and numberle&s;s needle&s;s law-&s;uits, with all the train of evils that follow. Now had men the &s;ame mind which was in Chri&s;t, all tho&s;e evils would &s;ub|&s;ide, and virtue, indu&s;try, frugality, and temperance take place. Godline&s;s with contentment is the greate&s;t

gain. But to proceed to matters or awful importance; true wi&s;dom in its fruits, and happy tendency, would either prevent all occa&s;ion of complaints, or compo&s;e the minds, and calm the tempers of murmuring com|plainers, and malecontents, in the &s;tate.</P>
<P>As there is lamentable evidence, by facts, and ob|&s;ervation, that in the be&s;t regulations and milde&s;t govern|ment, unrea&s;onable men will take occa&s;ion to complain without cau&s;e; &s;o it had been happy had there never been real occa&s;ion, and moving cau&s;e of complaint, and bitter grievance. But whether with or without cau&s;e, there has been almo&s;t ince&s;&s;ant complaints in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. I will go no further back than the times of general complaints, of a &s;inking, depreciating me|dium of trade; which are too recent to be forgotten. And no &s;ooner were the&s;e abated, but the calamities of a bloody &s;cene took place; whereby our trea&s;ures were exhau&s;ted, taxes run high, and numberle&s;s lives lo&s;t, and the morals of the youth &s;orely corrupted. And when this &s;torm abated, we were ready to promi&s;e our &s;elves a golden aera; when peace, plenty, and tranquility would &s;ucceed. And con&s;idering the glorious &s;ucce&s;s of the Briti&s;h and American arms, how the enemy were vanqui&s;hed by &s;ea and land; and what advantages providence placed in the hands of Great Britain, to di&s;enable an invidious &s;oe to afford future trouble, with at lea&s;t a colour of rea&s;on, we promi&s;ed our &s;elves that our land &s;hould yet be Emanuel's; and remain an a&s;ylum for the oppre&s;t; a land of peace and tranquility. But alas! the uncertainty of humane affairs, the weakne&s;s of humane pro&s;pects! the event
<PB N="18" REF="010354_0017_0F7EA247C6066B60">
has prov'd the rever&s;e. When our expectations were, rai&s;ed to the highe&s;t pitch; the Briti&s;h and American glory at the &s;ummit: What is become of the advan|tages, &s;o lately in the nation's hands? Ah, where is our peace and tranquility? a &s;inking medium was never more loudly complained of, than its &s;carcity is now. And to add to our di&s;tre&s;s, trade, the only re&s;ource in &s;uch ca&s;e, incumbered, and in great mea&s;ure ruined. And unpayable duties enacted: and liberty, darling liberty, and ine&s;timable privileges, which the&s;e &s;elf-&s;ettled colonies, (it is &s;aid) referved, as a condition of &s;ub|mitting to the Briti&s;h crown, and hold as &s;acred, and for which our pious ance&s;tors left their native foil, and to tran&s;mit which to po&s;terity, &s;uffered hard&s;hip, poverty and death; liberty, for which we have warred, and &s;uffered the lo&s;s of blood and trea&s;ure. Hope in the&s;e days, appeared on the wing, ready to bid adieu, and leave us in thraldom, poverty and bondage. Hi|therto in fix troubles and &s;even, we have been deli|vered; but now, good God! whither &s;hall we turn? to whom &s;hall we look? Can we &s;tand as di&s;intere&s;|ted &s;pectators, and &s;ee the ruin of our country? without a tear, without a dying &s;truggle: If I am I unable to govern the tender pa&s;&s;ion, let the nature of the ca&s;e apologize. Can any born among us, nouri&s;hed and care&s;&s;ed in a free air, put to an impious hand to urge on ruin? and can &s;uch be owned a friend to his country, or to filthy lucre only? with whom ju&s;tice permits me to rank, &s;uch as cro&s;s the atlantic, to import epi&s;copal tyranny, and &s;uch &s;uper&s;tition, as our predece&s;&s;ors fled hither to e&s;cape.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="010354_0018_0F7EA248625A99F8">Now in all our complaints and remon&s;trances (I am &s;orry to have occa&s;ion to &s;ay it) I am fearful we have not been directed by wi&s;dom, nor attended to the true cau&s;e: but rather overlook'd the main point. There has been very grievous complaints, of oppre&s;&s;ion, tyranny, and corrupt and de&s;igning mini&s;try: And of home bred abettors of tyranny, and well wi&s;hers to the late regulations. But however ju&s;t this may be, are we not reproved as Job was, in tho&s;e words. <HI>They cry out by rea&s;on of oppre&s;&s;ion, but none &s;aith, where is God my maker who giveth &s;ongs in the night.</HI> Though we have &s;een much, have we &s;een enough in the ca&s;e? Who is the moral governor of the world? Is there not a cau&s;e? Is there any evil in the city, which the Lord has not done? Have we been &s;uitably humble under frowns, deeply &s;en&s;ible of our &s;in, and contempt of go&s;pel grace, and ki&s;&s;ed the &s;on le&s;t he be angry, and put on &s;ackcloth? judged, and condemned our&s;elves?&mdash;for verily it is our iniquities, which have &s;eparated us from God, and the &s;miles of his providence. Methinks at lea&s;t we might have as good a degree of &s;en&s;ibility, as Saul had, after God had rejected him, who could &s;ay, I have &s;inned, and done fooli&s;hly.&mdash;When the king of Babylon plundered the city and temple of Jeru&s;alem, and captivated the people of God, God u&s;ed him as his rod, to puni&s;h the &s;ins of I&s;rael. Now how pitiful had been the ca&s;e, if I&s;rael had attended to nothing in their troubles, but the pride and tyranny of their conqueror? and how lamentable is our &s;tate, if we &s;ee not the rod, nor the hand that has ap|pointed
<PB N="20" REF="010354_0019_0F7EA24B01682B20">
it.&mdash;Now had we been wi&s;e, we had either never provoked God to &s;uch u&s;e of &s;everity: or have conducted quite differently under it: and learnt more &s;en&s;ibly, how evil and bitter a thing it is to &s;in again&s;t God. Yea we might take &s;anctuary in God. Such people are prepared for every event. All &s;hall work for the good of &s;uch. Whatever difficulties attend church or &s;tate, people of this character may rejoice that God reigns, and will defend Zion, and plead her cau&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT having tried your patience &s;o long already, I will mention that one more of the glorious fruits of true wi&s;dom, viz. It will &s;pirit rulers to faithful|ne&s;s, not only in making good and whol&s;ome laws, but al&s;o in nominating faithful men to execute them. The mo&s;t elaborate, &s;alutary body of laws, will ne|ver avail to the health and welfare of the &s;tate, unle&s;s they are properly executed. And there is little hope of this, unle&s;s it be committed to faithful men.
GOOD rulers, who fear God, will attempt to effect God's de&s;ign in their preferment: which the divine oracle informs us, is the good of the people: They are mini&s;ters of God for good. And from the &s;ame principle people will lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty. Where people are vo|luntary in doing well, coercive mea&s;ures are needle&s;s. True religion will give rulers plea&s;ure in gently holding the reins of government: and di&s;po&s;e people to practice holine&s;s in the fear of God, <Q>Godline&s;s with con|tentment, is great gain.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="010354_0020_0F7EA24BC304C038">THUS we have taken a &s;ummary imperfect account of the excellent nature, and inriching revenues, of true wi&s;dom.

<P>MAY it plea&s;e your honours, and you honorable gentlemen, in ordinary circum&s;tances, to dictate or pre&s;cribe to your &s;agacious minds, might excite con|ciou&s;ne&s;s of too great a degree of a&s;&s;urance: But &s;ince in pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, an attempt of &s;uch a nature is an act obedience; I have the more rea&s;on to hope you will &s;uffer me to intimate a few things.</P>
<P>IT is with the utmo&s;t propriety, that the impor|tant affairs of this day be opened with a &s;olemn act of divine wor&s;hip. From whence can the poli|tician go, to the arduous affairs of government, which be&s;ure in the pre&s;ent day of tumult requireth cool|ne&s;s, deliberation, and &s;acred regard to the deity, better than from the hou&s;e of God, where we have not only &s;upplicated for mercy, but had the nature of true religion opened, and the fruits of wi&s;dom exhibited to view?

<P>SINCE it has plea&s;ed the wi&s;e governor of the world, in the cour&s;e of providence, to rai&s;e you to eminent honour, dignity, and influence, and committed to you the public weal, no doubt but in ordinary circum|&s;tances

The &s;evere and awful frown of heaven upon the nation and land, in the removal of the duke of Cumberland, an amiable prince; a father to the poor; au&s;picious to Engli&s;h liberty, and a fa&s;t friend to the good of the colonies: together with the death of prince Fre|derick William, a lovely member of the royal family, of late has cloathed multitudes in &s;able attire; and may well remind all, what will be the &s;tate of the fabrick when the pillars are removed. The&s;e, together with a recent in&s;tance of mortality, in one of your number, a u&s;eful member of the honorable council, no doubt has &s;en&s;ibly reminded your honours of your own mortality.</P>
<P>SUFFER me then to recommend it to your honours, and you honorable gentlemen, to maintain an intimate acquaintance with true wi&s;dom, as what will not only qualify for, and a&s;&s;i&s;t in government, but al&s;o admi|ni&s;ter peace in the important hour of death. And as far as po&s;&s;ible, patroni&s;e and countenance wi&s;dom and virtue in the people governed by your laws, as nur|&s;ing fathers to the church of Chri&s;t.

<P>THE imperfect account we have heard of the ge|nuine nature and happy fruits of wi&s;dom, may &s;erve to bring to mind, in a &s;en&s;ible and affecting manner, the great honour which the glorious head of the church has conferred upon us, in the ble&s;&s;ed office and employment he has a&s;&s;igned to us; even to open to view the nature of religion, and by every proper motive, to per&s;wade men to be wi&s;e; knowing the terrors of the Lord, we per&s;wade men.
