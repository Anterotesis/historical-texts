<P>_ONE objection which the enemies of chri&s;tianity have made to the go&s;pel-in&s;titution is, that it no where recommends a public &s;pirit and the love of our country, or annexes any rewards to tho&s;e patriot-virtues, which formed the di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tic of the antient Greeks and Romans, and rai&s;ed tho&s;e celebrated republies to the highe&s;t pitch of power and opulence.&mdash;But whoever examines divine revelation with candor, will &s;oon &s;ee that this is a groundle&s;s and unrea&s;onable charge.&mdash;'Tis true, that intemperate zeal for the pro&s;perity of a parti|cular people,&mdash;that &s;trong and unbridled pa&s;&s;ion for the national glory, which was what they under&s;tood by love to their country, and which, after all the encomiums lavi&s;hed upon it, often

prompted to great inju&s;tice to other nations, has no place in the &s;cheme of chri&s;tian morals, nor is it fit it &s;hould. Such a temper and conduct, in&s;tead of a beauty, would be really a blemi&s;h and defect, in a revelation de&s;igned to &s;ub&s;erve the general good of &s;ociety, and promote univer&s;al love and benevolence to all mankind. And had our &s;aviour and his apo&s;tles, in the name of God, animated the Jewi&s;h nation to a warm zeal for their country and its liberties,&mdash;had they promi&s;ed divine and eternal rewards to the exerci&s;e of this virtue, this, in the then pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition and circum&s;tances of the nation, would doubtle&s;s have been con&s;trued as a lawle&s;s attempt to &s;ubvert the con&s;ti|tution, and foment a &s;pirit of &s;edition and rebellion in the &s;tate,&mdash;But if by love to our country be meant a well-tempered zeal for the public-good;&mdash;if an earne&s;t de&s;ire for the welfare of the community to which we belong;&mdash;if a cordial and di&s;in|tere&s;ted affection for our fellow-&s;ubjects;&mdash;if well-meant wi&s;hes for the national happine&s;s, and the mo&s;t active endeavours to promote its true intere&s;t, con&s;i&s;tent with the general laws of charity, and the univer&s;al obligations of benevolence to the whole human race;&mdash;if this be the true notion of patrioti&s;m, and con|veys the mo&s;t rational idea of that truly amiable and generous virtue; 'tis no where &s;o effectually taught as in the &s;acred oracles,&mdash;no where carried to &s;o high a pitch of perfection as in the word of God.&mdash;Mo&s;t certainly <Q>that charity which &s;eeks not her own,</Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 13.5.</NOTE> will exert it&s;elf for the good of others;&mdash;that chri&s;tian law of our divine ma&s;ter, which commands us <Q>to love even our enemies,</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. 5.44.</NOTE> will not &s;uffer us to overlook and neglect our friends;&mdash;that principle of univer&s;al benevolence which &s;hines on millions, and incircles all mankind in its friendly embrace; will &s;catter its warme&s;t and kinde&s;t influences on our dear country;&mdash;and tho&s;e precepts which require us to maintain &s;uch a noble &s;pirit of di&s;intere&s;ted love to our brethren, as <Q>to lay down our lives for their &s;akes</Q> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">1 John 3.16.</NOTE>, would &s;urely engage

and animate us, even to die for the good of the community, if called by divine providence &s;o to do.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, there never was &s;o glorious an in&s;tance of this noble and generous virtue, as we &s;ee exhibited in the life and actions of our ble&s;&s;ed REDEEMER, the divine author of this in&s;titution. Warm with a generous, a di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence to mankind; he laid down his life for their redemption: Ani|mated by a true &s;pirit of patrioti&s;m, he gave the mo&s;t &s;ignal proofs of love to his country, and manife&s;ted the &s;incere&s;t affec|tion for the Jewi&s;h nation, from whom he &s;prung, according to the fle&s;h. Hence aro&s;e that amiable concern he expre&s;&s;ed for the mi&s;eries he fore&s;aw coming upon them, in his moving and pathetic lamentation over Jeru&s;alem, recorded by the evangeli&s;ts.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Luke 13.34.</NOTE> Hence were tho&s;e kind endeavours he u&s;ed to prevent the&s;e evils, by checking the tumultuous &s;pirit then kindling amomg them, and engaging them to a peaceable &s;ubjection to the Roman government. And to this, may we not add, it was owing, at lea&s;t in part, that, as he declared <Q>he was not &s;ent, except to, the lo&s;t &s;heep of the hou&s;e of I&s;rael</Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mat. 15.24.</NOTE>; &s;o the whole of his public mini&s;try was confined to that nation, and all tho&s;e glo|rious and beneficent miracles he wrought, were limited to the country that gave him birth? May we not view the&s;e miracu|lous operations, in one re&s;pect, as &s;o many &s;olid atte&s;tations of true patrioti&s;m and &s;triking evidences of love to his country? In this view, no doubt, they were con&s;idered by the men of that age: And therefore when the elders of the Jews apply to him, with a reque&s;t from the Roman centurion, that he would come and heal his &s;ervant; they recommend him as one who was eminently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this virtue, and as &s;uch, a very pro|per object of our Saviour's regard.&mdash;'He is worthy, (&s;ay they) <Q>for whom thou &s;halt do this, for he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a &s;ynagogue.</Q>&mdash;He was a Roman officer: But as he was po&s;ted in Judea, he con&s;idered it as his country,
<PB N="8" REF="009866_0007_0F7B32EB8FF39E40">
and te&s;tified his affection to it, by public-&s;pirited actions. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whether this centurion was a pro&s;elyte to the Jewi&s;h church, or not, appears to me very uncertain. Mr. Pool's continuators upon the parallel place Mat. 8, rather think he was not, tho' &s;ome interpreters &s;uppo&s;e he was. Our Saviour, in the commendation he gives of his great faith, &s;eems rather. I imagine, to con&s;ider him as one who had hitherto lived in Pagani&s;m, and therefore his great faith in the power and grace of Chri&s;t was the more remarkable on that account "I have not found (&s;ays he) &s;o great faith, no not in I&s;rael." And in this view his building the Jews a &s;ynagogue will appear a more notable and &s;triking in&s;tance of public &s;pirit and love to his country.</NOTE> And tho' he was probably educated in idolatry, yet &s;uch was his regard for his fellow-&s;ubjects among whom he lived, that he chearfully contributed to the &s;upport of the Jewi&s;h religion, and generou&s;ly built them a &s;ynagogue, for the wor&s;hip of the God of I&s;rael, at his own expence. The true patriot will not abate of his love to his country, or de&s;ert its intere&s;ts, barely becau&s;e the religion therein profe&s;&s;ed and e&s;tabli&s;hed, differs from his own: So far from it, that if there be nothing in &s;uch religion repugnant to the general laws of rea&s;on and morality, or &s;ub|ver&s;ive of the natural rights and liberties of mankind; he will look upon him&s;elf obliged to promote it, and chearfully con|tribute to its &s;upport. This then was the virtue, on account of which this Roman officer was recommended by the Jewi&s;h elders, as worthy the notice of our Saviour, and of which Chri&s;t accordingly te&s;tified his approbation by going and healing his &s;ervant. And in this view the words afford a proper argument for a di&s;cour&s;e upon the virtue of PATRIOTISM, and naturally lead us to con&s;ider this noble principle in its nature,&mdash;properties,&mdash;and effects.</P>
<P>TRUE PATRIOTISM then, con&s;idered as a principle, is the &s;ame thing with public &s;pirit, or a generous love to our coun|try,&mdash;a regard for the happine&s;s of our fellow-creatures, e&s;pecial|ly a tender concern for the welfare of our fellow-&s;ubjects.</P>
<P>SELF-LOVE, or a regard to our own happine&s;s, is an innate and inextingui&s;hable principle in the human mind: But then,&mdash;that we are not born for our&s;elves only,&mdash;con&s;equently are not
<PB N="9" REF="009866_0008_0F7B32EC464CAFA8">
to confine our views to our own private intere&s;t, &s;eperate from that of the community, much le&s;s in oppo&s;ition to it; is a genuine dictate of rea&s;on, philo&s;ophy, and revelation.&mdash;From the fir&s;t dawn of life to its final period, we are nece&s;&s;arily de|pendent.&mdash;Fir&s;t and principally indeed, upon the great author of nature; but next and &s;ubordinately upon our fellow-creatures with whom we &s;tand connected. As we advance forward in life, the&s;e reciprocal dependencies and connexions, and con&s;e|quently the &s;ocial obligations thence re&s;ulting, multiply and increa&s;e. Our happine&s;s and &s;ecurity, or rather the &s;prings from whence they derive, branch out into innumerable channels, and demand a corre&s;pondent attention. If therefore a principle of &s;elf-love, prompts us to &s;eek our own particular happine&s;s, becau&s;e it is ours; the &s;ame principle mu&s;t induce us to love our country and &s;eek its welfare, becau&s;e our own is involved in it, and in&s;eperably connected with it. And thus even from &s;elf-love and a de&s;ire of happine&s;s, we are directed to &s;eek the good of the public, and yield obedience to that apo&s;tolic precept,&mdash;<Q>look not every man on his own things, but every man al&s;o on the things of others</Q> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Phil. 11.4.</NOTE>. In this view of the ca&s;e that ob|&s;ervation is verified,&mdash;</P>
<P>"That true &s;elf-love and &s;ocial are the &s;ame."</P>
<P>This principle of benevolence begins with our&s;elves&mdash;Family connexions and private friend&s;hips are its next objects.&mdash;It &s;preads on to our neighbours and acquaintance.&mdash;Our country feels its cheri&s;hing influence next.&mdash;Still it expands and widens till it comprehends all the human &s;pecies, and finally inclo&s;es the whole creation in the friendly and generous circle.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>SELF LOVE but &s;erves the virtuous mind to wake,</L>

<P><PB N="10" REF="009866_0009_0F7B32ED0E089EF0">HENCE it appears, that though patrioti&s;m has its origin in &s;elf|love, and is ever con&s;i&s;tent with it; yet it is widely different from, or rather directly oppo&s;ite to the principle that commonly goes under that name. The true patriot has a noble and exalted notion of happine&s;s: He does not confine it to his own per&s;onal intere&s;t and convenience, or limit it to the contracted circle of his family, or particular friends; but comprehends in his idea of it the welfare of millions, and e&s;pecially includes the &s;afety and pro&s;perity of his dear country in the account. And while the &s;elfi&s;h man confines his views wholly to his private intere&s;t, and meanly coils him&s;elf up it the narrow and dirty &s;hell of his own per&s;onal &s;afety, and happine&s;s; the true patriot, ever &s;tu|dious of the public good, and concerned for its pro&s;perity; ardently de&s;ires its happine&s;s, and warmly intere&s;ts him&s;elf in its various vici&s;&s;itudes. The mi&s;eries of his country awaken his inmo&s;t grief and compa&s;&s;ion. At &s;ight of the public calamities, his benevolent heart bleeds. He rejoices in its emolument, and feels the noble&s;t &s;atisfaction in its &s;afety, pro&s;perity and glory. However flouri&s;hing his own private affairs are; if his country is in danger, and the public happine&s;s interrupted or in&s;ecure:&mdash;Is it involved in the calamities of war,&mdash;ravaged and depopu|lated by foreign enemies, or weakened and rent by civil di&s;cord, dome&s;tic faction, and inte&s;tine &s;trife:&mdash;Does it groan under the iron rod of de&s;poti&s;m and tyranny, or has its foundations &s;apped by a prevailing &s;pirit of anarchy, levelli&s;m, and irrefrenable licentiou&s;ne&s;s:&mdash;If public credit runs low, and a general temper of diffidence, di&s;tru&s;t, and di&s;affection to government prevails:&mdash;If oeconomy, and indu&s;try, manufactures, navigation, and commerce, tho&s;e &s;ources of wealth, and unfailing &s;prings of public pro&s;perity, dwindle and decline:&mdash;And on the other
<PB N="11" REF="009866_0010_0F7B32EE8A4C4AA0">
hand, idlene&s;s, contention, intemperance, di&s;&s;ipation, and pro|digality, increa&s;e and abound.&mdash;In a word:&mdash;If righteou&s;ne&s;s, charity, peace, truth, faithfulne&s;s, and liberality, together with tho&s;e other amiable and &s;alutary virtues, &s;o directly tending to "exalt a nation," evidently fade and langui&s;h; and the oppo&s;ite vices, which are a "reproach," a &s;hame and ruin to a civil community, become fa&s;hionable and prevail:&mdash;The&s;e things will affect the true patriot with the mo&s;t keen and &s;en&s;ible an|gui&s;h, will di&s;pirit his happine&s;s, and damp his joy amid&s;t the highe&s;t tides of dome&s;tic pro&s;perity, or the greate&s;t affluence of per&s;onal and family enjoyments.&mdash;He who does not thus feel for his country, is a &s;tranger to this noble and generous impul&s;e:&mdash;He who regards his own intere&s;t above that of the public, is a concealed enemy to the &s;tate:&mdash;He who pur&s;ues his own little affairs at the expence of his fellow-&s;ubjects, and does not <Q>prefer Jeru&s;alem above his chief joy</Q>; whenever there happens a competition, will &s;acrifice the public happine&s;s to his own pri|vate convenience;&mdash;will commence a rebel, a traytor to his country; and, if he has opportunity, rob and plunder the pub|lic, to promote his own paltry purpo&s;es and de&s;igns.</P>
<P>TO LOVE our country then,&mdash;to de&s;ire its pro&s;perity, and warmly intere&s;t our&s;elves in its various vici&s;&s;itudes, is part, and but part, of this noble virtue of patrioti&s;m.&mdash;Some men have &s;o much hone&s;ty, as not to hurt the public; but have not zeal enough for its welfare to do it any good. They are proof, perhaps, again&s;t any temptation to injure it; but will never exert them&s;elves for its happine&s;s.&mdash;Their love to their country is much like that cold, ineffective charity, mentioned by the ap|po&s;tle <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jam. II. 16</NOTE>, which barely &s;ays, "&mdash;be ye warmed and filled"; but after all its pretended good wi&s;hes, "does not profit" is of no avail to the object of it. If all men were of this indolent and lukewarm di&s;po&s;ition, government mu&s;t &s;oon be unhinged, the foundations of public peace and happine&s;s di&s;olved, and the
<PB N="12" REF="009866_0011_0F7B32EF45AC9B30">
&s;afety and welfare of the community become a prey to the fir&s;t invader. Would we merit the glorious character of patriots, we mu&s;t not only wi&s;h, but act for our country's good. Our love to the public mu&s;t exemplify it&s;elf, in public-&s;pirited actions and &s;ervices, equal to our abilities, and proportionate to the utmo&s;t extent of our power and influence.&mdash;The true patriot, therefore, is one who allows his country a &s;hare in his thinking hours. He is &s;tudious of its welfare, thoughtful of its happine&s;s, and plans and projects for its &s;afety. Civil go|vernment is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to public happine&s;s. But without good laws, and whole&s;ome in&s;titutions, government cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t. At lea&s;t, it can never an&s;wer tho&s;e &s;alutary pur|po&s;es for which it was appointed, in any tolerable degree. And to frame the&s;e laws,&mdash;to adapt the&s;e rules and maxims of government to the genius of the people, the circum&s;tances of time and place, and the various exigencies of the &s;tate; demands the &s;tudy, the wi&s;dom and &s;kill of the politician.</P>
<P>BUT the legi&s;lator is not the only man who &s;tudies and plans for the good of the public. Whoever projects any thing con|ducive to the welfare of his country, tho' it be but to the throw|ing out a hint that may be improved to that purpo&s;e:&mdash;He who invents any new and u&s;eful arts of life, or makes or communi|cates any valuable improvements in tho&s;e already found out; is &s;o far forth a patriot, and de&s;erves his country's thanks: E&s;pecially the man who &s;tudies to promote its be&s;t intere&s;ts, to curb the vices and reform the morals of a degenerate age, and to introduce and cheri&s;h the amiable, the beneficial virtues of chri&s;tianity among his fellow-men, is highly de&s;erving of that character: And he who refu&s;es or neglects the&s;e things, when it is in his power, is no true friend to the public:&mdash;Nay he is an enemy to his courtry, in proportion to the value and im|portance of his neglected &s;ervices.</P>
<P>FURTHER &s;till;&mdash;love to our country requires, that we act, as well as &s;tudy and think, for the public good.&mdash;The &s;ituation
<PB N="13" REF="009866_0012_0F7B32F385DEA7B0">
of our country may be &s;uch, as to demand the utmo&s;t exer|tion of our power and influence in its behalf: And the duty we owe the public, requires a chearful compliance with this demand. The true patriot is one, who&s;e pur&s;e, as well as his heart, is open for the defence and &s;upport of his country. "His liberal &s;oul devi&s;es liberal things," and his generous hand is over ready to execute his liberal purpo&s;es.&mdash;As a ruler, every well-concerted and public-&s;pirited mea&s;ure, is &s;ure to meet with his approbation, and gain his &s;uffrage.&mdash;As a &s;ubject, he &s;corns to be &s;tingy and par&s;imonious, when the &s;afety or welfare of his country calls for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. When any noble and generous de&s;ign is on foot, that has a friendly a&s;pect upon the commu|nity;&mdash;be it for the reformation of manners,&mdash;the promotion of learning,&mdash;the advancement of virtue and religion, or any thing that tends to the public emolument;&mdash;then, in proportion to this ability, he will be <Q>rich in good works, ready to di&s;tribute, willing to communicate.</Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. VI.18.</NOTE>&mdash;In a word:&mdash;As love to the public is his ruling pa&s;&s;ion, con&s;idered as a member of &s;ociety the grand object of his ambition is, to &s;hield it from danger, and promote its welfare. In pur&s;uit of this he is indefatigable and undaunted. Nor hope nor fear can &s;hake his re&s;olution, or warp him a&s;ide from his duty. The mo&s;t lucrative con&s;idera|tions, are no temptations to him, to betray his country, or de&s;ert its intere&s;t. To bribery, he is an avowed enemy. He di&s;dains the mean and dirty arts of corruption. To ri&s;e upon the ruins of his country, or &s;acrifice its intere&s;t to his own private &s;chemes, or the narrow and contracted views of a party:&mdash;To enrich him&s;elf at the expence of the community, or fatten and riot on the public &s;poils, his generous &s;oul abhors. Love to his country is his predominant principle.&mdash;He is unwearied in his attempts to promote its happine&s;s.&mdash;Not even in&s;en&s;ibility in the public, of his benevolent purpo&s;es; nor the mo&s;t ungrateful returns for his well-meant wi&s;hes and &s;ervices, can damp his patriot ardor,
<PB N="14" REF="009866_0013_0F7B32F419437FB0">
cau&s;e him to di&s;continue his attempts in its favour, or di&s;courage him in the noble and generous pur&s;uit. When his country is invaded and demands his &s;ervice, he de&s;pi&s;es danger, and boldly hazards his life in its defence. He gallantly oppo&s;es his brea&s;t, to the drawn &s;words and &s;pears of its enemies; he nobly re&s;olves to procure its &s;afety, or &s;hed his blood in the generous conflict, "and bravely die in the la&s;t ditch."&mdash;Thus engaged is the true patriot in his country's behalf.&mdash;His heart and his head,&mdash;his tongue,&mdash;his pen, and his hands,&mdash;his e&s;tate,&mdash;yea and even his life too, are ready at its &s;ervice, and devoted to its intere&s;t, whenever they are called for.</P>
<P>BUT 'tis not every pretended regard for our country, or zeal for the public welfare, that de&s;erves the name of public|&s;pirit. There are hypocrites and impo&s;tors, wild enthu&s;ia&s;ts and frantic zealots in patrioti&s;m and politics, as well as in religion. Too often the re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirit of di&s;affection and di&s;|content,&mdash;the wild zeal of ambition and faction, or the ungo|vernable fury of &s;edition, trea&s;on and rebellion, a&s;&s;ume the ma&s;k of patrioti&s;m, artfully mimic the air of public-&s;pirit, and endea|vour to obtrude them&s;elves upon the world for a di&s;intere&s;ted regard for the common happine&s;s. But 'tis not difficult for a di&s;cerning eye to detect the impo&s;ture, and unma&s;k the cheat. Men of this ca&s;t and complexion, under all the&s;e &s;pecious di&s;|gui&s;es, have &s;ome &s;elfi&s;h &s;cheme at bottom, which a little atten|tion will &s;erve to lay open and expo&s;e.

Men of this &s;ort, are ever ready to clamour, and find fault, with the conduct of all public mea&s;ures in which, they have no hand: E&s;pecially, if cro&s;&s;ed in any favourite pur|po&s;e, they at once &s;et up a cry;&mdash;<Q>the country is in danger; the public is ruined;</Q>&mdash;when probably, all the bu&s;ine&s;s is, that them&s;elves are out of power, or they meet with oppo&s;ition in pro&s;ecuting &s;ome private &s;cheme, or party project, injurious to the country, or de&s;tructive of the public happine&s;s. But &s;o argue again&s;t the being and excellence of public-&s;pirit, from the&s;e pernicious arts of ill-de&s;igning men, is ju&s;t as illogical and ab&s;urd as to conclude, that becau&s;e there are hypocrites and pretenders in religion, therefore religion has no exi&s;tence, and virtue no real charms. On the contrary, 'tis a convincing argument in its favour:&mdash;'Tis a clear evidence that there is indeed &s;omething truly excellent in the &s;ub&s;tance, when even the &s;hadow is captivating: The reality needs mu&s;t be valuable, &s;ince the bare appearance is thus capable to con|ceal the deformity of vice, and render even wickedne&s;s re&s;pect|able.

and properties. Wherever it prevails among a people, it has a kind and &s;alutary influence, and is ever productive of the happie&s;t effects. Next to the ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven upon a coun|try, 'tis the firme&s;t foundation of &s;ocial happine&s;s, the mo&s;t &s;ure and unfailing &s;pring of the public &s;afety, pro&s;perity and glory. Did it univer&s;ally govern, univer&s;al tranquility would be the con&s;equence:&mdash;In proportion to its influence in a community, the public felicity is &s;ecure. To trace it in all its happy con&s;e|quences, and enumerate the many advantages re&s;ulting from it to a people among whom it generally prevails, requires more time than is at pre&s;ent allowed me, were I equal to the ta&s;k. Suffice it to &s;ay,&mdash;that the liberties of a people will be &s;afe;&mdash;their lives, per&s;ons, and properties &s;ecure;&mdash;the important intere&s;t of learning promoted;&mdash;and virtue and true religion encoura|ged, in proportion to the prevalence of patriot-principles and public-&s;pirit among them.</P>
<P>LIBERTY is the glory of a community, the mo&s;t firm and un&s;haken ba&s;is of public happine&s;s. <Q>This gives an inexpre&s;&s;i|ble charm to all our enjoyments:&mdash;It imparts a reli&s;h to the mo&s;t indifferent plea&s;ures, and renders the highe&s;t gratifica|tions doubly delightful. It &s;mooths the rugged brow of adver&s;ity, and endears and enhances every acqui&s;ition.</Q>&mdash;The want of this will abate the value of all the comforts of life. The imbittering circum&s;tance of precarious property:&mdash;The grating reflection, that life and all its enjoyments, lie at the mercy of a tyrant, and are liable, every moment, to be ravi&s;hed by the lawle&s;s hand of violence;&mdash;mars the reli&s;h of every gratification, and throws a melancholly gloom upon all temporal enjoyments. But wherever public-&s;pirit prevails; liberty is &s;ecure. There men may freely think for them&s;elves, and publi&s;h their &s;entiments on religion or government, without mole&s;tation or fear. For as liberty is the &s;ource of &s;o much public-happine&s;s; he who is a patriot, and wi&s;hes well to his country, mu&s;t needs be a fa&s;t friend to it, a warm and &s;trenuous

The &s;afety of the&s;e is in&s;eperably connected with civil liberty, which, as we have heard, is a genuine con&s;equence of public|&s;pirit, They never can be wre&s;ted, from us but by cruelty and oppre&s;&s;ion,&mdash;vices which can have no exi&s;tence in a patriot-&s;tate. In po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings we are therefore &s;ecure, unle&s;s, by our crimes, we make a foreiture of them to the public: But this we never &s;hall do, if we our&s;elves act under the influ|ence of this virtue.</P>
<P>LEARNING is another great and ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ing to &s;ociety,&mdash;a &s;hining ornament to a country, and productive of the hap|pie&s;t con&s;equences. Imagination can &s;carce paint the &s;uperior condition of that &s;tate, where learning, &s;cience, and the liberal arts flouri&s;h; to that of a rude and unpoli&s;hed people, over-run with barbari&s;m and ignorance. But learning is both the nur&s;e and off-&s;pring of public-&s;pirit, in different views. 'Tis impo&s;|&s;ible therefore that it &s;hould be di&s;couraged, or its important intere&s;ts neglected, where this noble principle governs. 'Tis the character, the genuine tendency of public-&s;pirit, to pro|mote &s;ocial happine&s;s in all po&s;&s;ible ways. As learning, there|fore, has &s;uch a kind and &s;alutary influence on the good of &s;ociety; it mu&s;t needs be the object of the true patriot's kinde&s;t regard:&mdash;what he will mo&s;t tenderly promote and cheri&s;h, and ever &s;hew him&s;elf a warm friend and patron to its important intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>ON the &s;ame principles, religion and virtue mu&s;t ever be the object of the patriot's care, and every thing done to encourage and promote it, where public-&s;pirit, prevails. The genuine principles of chri&s;tianity;&mdash;that &s;pirit and temper which the go&s;pel in&s;pires all its true votaries with, has the kinde&s;t influ|ence upon public happine&s;s, both in a natural and moral re&s;pect. It's direct tendency is, to reform the vices, and correct tho&s;e
<PB N="18" REF="009866_0017_0F7B32FA531B9618">
corrupt di&s;po&s;itions of the human heart, which, in their ope|ration, are ever inimical to &s;ociety, and &s;ubver&s;ive of all the important intere&s;ts of mankind. In the room of the&s;e it im|plants and cultivates the virtues of ju&s;tice, truth, loyalty, faith|fulne&s;s and charity, &s;o friendly to &s;ocial-happine&s;s, and certainly productive of public peace. And be&s;ides all this, true religion and public virtue, recommend a people to the divine protection, and engage the &s;miles of heaven for their &s;afety and pro&s;perity.&mdash;This intere&s;t, therefore, will nece&s;&s;arily engage the attention of the true patrior. In proportion as he loves his country, he will regard religion, and labour to promote it. He will care|fully attend its &s;acred in&s;titutions him&s;elf, and generou&s;ly contribute to &s;upport its wor&s;hip and mini&s;try. <Q>If he loves his nation, he will build it a &s;ynagogue,</Q> and promote it's religious intere&s;ts to the utmo&s;t of his power, becau&s;e he knows the public happine&s;s, which ever lies near his heart, is nece&s;&s;arily dependent upon, and in&s;eperably connected with, this great and important concern.</P>
<P>IN fine:&mdash;The prevalence of this principle would have a mo&s;t happy influence upon the religious, the literary, civil, military, and commercial intere&s;ts of a people. It would be one of the mo&s;t powerful checks upon tho&s;e vices in particular, which &s;trike at the very being of &s;ociety, and directly threaten its ruin; while it animated all ranks and orders in the &s;tate, to acquire and cultivate tho&s;e virtues, which are mo&s;t conducive to its happi|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>DID the civil rulers of a people, for in&s;tance, thoroughly im|bibe this generous &s;pirit, how happy would the community be under their admini&s;tration? This would be a &s;ure pre&s;erva|tion again&s;t pride and unbounded ambition: It would prevent peculation, lawle&s;s power, and undue &s;tretch of prerogative; and be an effectual curb upon oppre&s;&s;ion, tyranny and arbi|trary rule.&mdash;On the contrary, it would induce them to con|&s;ider and conduct them&s;elves, as the fathers of the peoples,
<PB N="19" REF="009866_0018_0F7B32FB4E27DEF0">
&mdash;as the faithful guardians of their liberties, properties, and lives;&mdash;as rai&s;ed, by divine providence, to their elevated &s;tations, not for their own grandeur and ea&s;e; but for the health and happine&s;s of the community. In this view king David con&s;idered his elevation to the throne of I&s;rael.&mdash;<Q>He perceived that the Lord had e&s;tabli&s;hed him king over I&s;rael, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his peo|ple I&s;rael's &s;ake.</Q> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">11 Sam, V.12.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS principle would animate go&s;pel-mini&s;ters to a faithful di&s;charge of the important duties of their office. Love to their country would extingui&s;h the hateful &s;pirit of bigotry, &s;uper&s;tition, and thir&s;t of dominion; and in&s;pire the amiable virtues of humility and meekne&s;s, candor, catholici&s;m, and true chri&s;tian love. It would be a powerful &s;pur to indu&s;try,&mdash;would make them &s;tudious and laborious in their great work, diligent and zealous in propagating the benevolent principles of chri&s;tianity, and e&s;pecially careful to enforce the great duties of charity, and loyalty, the true go&s;pel|patrioti&s;m, &s;o frequently taught and &s;o forcibly recommended by the precepts and example of their divine ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>NOR would the good effects of this principle, upon &s;ubjects and the body of the people in general, be le&s;s vi&s;ible and happy. Idlene&s;s, prodigality, and intemperance, &s;o pernicious to &s;ociety, would di&s;appear; and a &s;pirit of indu&s;try, fru|gality and good oeconomy take place, in proportion as patriot-virtue gained ground, Fraud and knavery in deal|ing,&mdash;a &s;pirit of contention and litigation,&mdash;deceit, cheating and lying. &s;muggling and illicit trade, will vani&s;h;&mdash;and truth, ju&s;tice and equity,&mdash;good-faith, probity and honour, in all civil contracts and &s;ocial commerce among men, will abound and flouri&s;h in a patriot-&s;tate,&mdash;To add no more:&mdash;Public-&s;pirit will totally extirpate the malignant &s;eeds of di&s;affection and di&s;obedience to authority,&mdash;cru&s;h the &s;pirit

of &s;edition and rebellion, and cultivate and cheri&s;h the true principles of loyalty, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and peace;&mdash;virtues mo&s;t friendly to &s;ociety, and eminently conducive to the public &s;afety and pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>THUS have I attempted to exhibit a portrait of this ami|able and &s;alutary virtue, in its general nature and con&s;equen|ces.&mdash;Were the de&s;ign executed to the life, it would command univer&s;sal re&s;pect:&mdash;Did the picture an&s;wer to the original, it mu&s;t needs charm every beholder, and conciliate the e&s;teem and veneration of every rational intelligence.</P>
<P>WHAT then remains, but to urge and pre&s;s it upon all ranks and orders in the &s;tate, to acquire and cultivate this generous principle?&mdash;Ever to act the influence of it them&s;elves, and labour to encourage and promote it in others? Thus to do, is the indi&s;pen&s;able duty of every member of &s;ociety, as &s;uch, and what their own per&s;onal intere&s;t and &s;afety demands. The relation we all &s;tand in to the public, renders &s;uch a conduct highly rea&s;onable and becoming: And as our own particular happine&s;s is dependent upon, and in&s;eperably connected with, the &s;afety and pro&s;perity of the whole; a &s;uitable regard to that mu&s;t certainly induce us to wi&s;h well to our country, and labour to promote its welfare by all lawful means.&mdash;Do we need examples to fire us with ambition, and urge us on this glorious pur&s;uit? Both &s;acred and pro&s;ane hi&s;tory abound with many &s;hining in&s;tances of this heroic virtue, in the celebrated names of antiquity there recorded.&mdash;I have mentioned the example of the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, who was eminent for this and every other virtue.&mdash;Mo&s;es, the illu&s;trious leader of I&s;rael, and Paul, the great doctor of the Gentiles, were both in&s;pired with this laudable principle in a very exalted degree.

How alarming the admonition!&mdash;How quickening the con&s;ideration to the utmo&s;t diligence and faithfulne&s;s in their great work!</P>
<P>THE nece&s;&s;ary qualifications of magi&s;tracy, and the various duties of their high &s;tation, in their legi&s;lative, judicial and executive capacities, your honours, I pre&s;ume, are not unac|quainted with. They have often been enumerated and urged upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, and I need not repeat them. Suffer me, however, to mention one political evil, which, among many others, &s;eems loudly to call for a &s;peedy redre&s;s.&mdash;I mean the great multiplicity of needle&s;s di&s;putes and contentions in the law. This colony, perhaps, above any in his maje&s;ty's dominions, has been long famed for this litigious di&s;po&s;ition. And it is &s;o far from being abated, that the number of law-&s;uits, in the year pa&s;t, is probably much greater than in any preceeding year. Whether this temper and practice be owing to the free nature of our civil con&s;titution, the genius of the people, or to what other cau&s;e, is perhaps, difficult to &s;ay. Certain it is, however, that &s;uch a &s;pirit is ruinous, in its operation, to individuals, and highly injurious to the public happine&s;s. There is little doubt, but the time and money, needle&s;sly &s;pent this way, would much more than defray all the public expences of the colony. Be&s;ides the ill blood it tends to create, what a prodigious drain mu&s;t this be to the government? How does "eat like a canker," prey upon the very blood and vitals of the community, and loudly threaten its ruin, unle&s;s &s;peedily checked? Whether increa&s;ing the co&s;ts of &s;uit, and making it more expen&s;ive to go to law, would have a tendency to di&s;courage the practice; or whether any proper and effectual remedy can be applied in

the ca&s;e, I will not pre&s;ume to &s;ay. If the di&s;ea&s;e is not incurable, it loudly calls for the help of the political phy|&s;ician: And, I tru&s;t, your honours, deeply &s;en&s;ible of the great importance of it, will leave no means unattempted, to put a &s;peedy &s;top to the growing mi&s;chief. May the father of lights, the inexhau&s;tible fountain of truth and good|ne&s;s, repleni&s;h your minds with wi&s;dom, faithfulne&s;s, ju&s;tice, fortitude, love to your country, and every ruling virtue. May public-&s;pirit be the predominant principle of your con|duct,&mdash;ever animate your debates, and direct your councils and deliberations for the public happine&s;s. Under the go|verning, influence of this, you will exert your authority, in your &s;everal &s;tations and departments, to reform the morals of the people under your government.&mdash;To puni&s;h and &s;up|pre&s;s the awful prevalence of immorality, profanene&s;s, intem|perance, uncleanne&s;s, &s;abbath-breaking, neglect of public wor&s;hip and every other vice.&mdash;And promote and encourage virtue and piety, by enacting new laws, if need be, for the&s;e &s;alutary purpo&s;es, and faithfully executing tho&s;e that are in force. And while you &s;hew your&s;elves the noble patrons of chri&s;tian liberty, the faithful guardians of the unalienable rights of con&s;cience, to the &s;ober di&s;&s;enters among us, of every deno|mination; we ju&s;tly expect the continuance of your more peculiar and di&s;tingui&s;hing regard, to the con&s;tituted churches of this colony, as e&s;tabli&s;hed by law. The&s;e, certainly, de|mand your patronage.&mdash;They ju&s;tly claim the countenance, the encouragement and &s;upport of a chri&s;tian magi&s;tracy, by who&s;e laws they are expre&s;ly e&s;tabli&s;hed, and under who&s;e protection they &s;o long flouri&s;hed and increa&s;ed. Let the intere&s;t of learning al&s;o &s;hare your paternal regard. This is intimately connected with the public happine&s;s, and the care of it properly falls within the province of the civil magi&s;trate. May our college and and inferior &s;chools, there|fore,

con&s;tantly engage your attention, and &s;till be the objects of your patriot-care. And may their important intere&s;ts more and more flouri&s;h under your wi&s;e admini&s;tration. Thus will you an&s;wer the ju&s;t expectations of your con&s;tituents, and approve your&s;elves the true friends and fathers of your country. The pre&s;ent generation will ri&s;e up and call you ble&s;&s;ed,&mdash;your memories will be embalmed to po&s;terity, ages yet un|born will honour and revere your names; and what is &s;till infinitely more, if you are faithful to God and your country, you will e'er long meet the final plaudit of your &s;upreme judge, and &s;hare in tho&s;e endle&s;s honours and divine joys which, through Chri&s;t, are the promi&s;ed rewards of di&s;tin|gui&s;hed virtue and goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>I NOW turn to the amba&s;&s;adors of Chri&s;t, the kind father of his people, and the great benefactor of the univer&s;e.&mdash;</P>
<P>REVEREND fathers and brethren.&mdash;</P>
<P>WE too are concerned, intimately concerned in the intere&s;ting &s;ubject before us.&mdash;Next to the glory of his father, a &s;pirit of di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence, and the mo&s;t generous love to man|kind, was the governing principle in the life and actions of our divine ma&s;ter, and it ought to be &s;o in his di&s;ciples and &s;ervants, e&s;pecially the officers of his hou&s;hold, the mini&s;ters of his everla&s;ting go&s;pel. Our character is that of amba&s;&s;adors of peace, and heralds of divine mercy and grace to a peri&s;hing world.&mdash;To publi&s;h the glad tidings of &s;alvation;&mdash;to win &s;ouls to Chri&s;t;&mdash;to be&s;eech &s;inners, in his name, to be recon|ciled to God;&mdash;to open up to mankind the un&s;earchable riches of divine grace, and explain and enforce the whole &s;cheme of go&s;pel-duties and chri&s;tian morals:&mdash;Thus to &s;ub&s;erve the be&s;t intere&s;t of &s;ociety, and promote the eternal happine&s;s of our fellow-men, is the great end of our office,&mdash;the honourable, the important bu&s;ine&s;s in which we are employed. We are

placed as centinels upon the walls of Zion, to guard again&s;t &s;in, the wor&s;t enemy of our country, and &s;ound the alarm in God's holy mountain. <Q>We watch for &s;ouls, as they that mu&s;t give account,</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. XIII.17.</NOTE> and woe be to us if we are unfaithful. <Q>For, as they who turn many to righteou&s;ne&s;s, will &s;hine</Q> with di&s;tin|gui&s;hed lu&s;tre in the kingdom of glory; &s;o they who are un|faithful in the chri&s;tian mini&s;try, and do the work of the Lord deceitfully; contract aggravated guilt, and expo&s;e them&s;elves to a mo&s;t awful and intolerable doom. But next to <Q>the love of God &s;hed abroad in our hearts by the holy Gho&s;t;</Q> a principle of true patrioti&s;m and public-&s;pirit, a &s;incere regard to the be&s;t good of &s;ociety and a generous, di&s;intere&s;ted bene|volence to mankind, will be found the mo&s;t animating &s;pring to indu&s;try, the noble&s;t incentive to diligence and faithfulne&s;s in our great work. The go&s;pel we preach, is a &s;y&s;tem of bene|volence and love, and all its doctrines and precepts promotive of &s;ocial happine&s;s. This virtue of patrioti&s;m, therefore, &s;o congenial to our profe&s;&s;ion, and &s;o peculiarly ornamental and becoming the &s;acred character, it highly concerns us to acquire and cultivate;&mdash;ever to act under the influence of it our&s;elves, and, both by example and precept, labour to recommened it to others. <Q>While, therefore, we &s;tudy to &s;hew our&s;elves approved, unto God, workmen that need not be a&s;hamed, rightly divid|ing the word of truth:</Q> <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">II Tim, II.15.</NOTE> Let us, together with the great go&s;pel-doctrines of <Q>repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts XX.21.</NOTE> faithfully inculcate the relative duties of chri&s;tianity, and urge upon our hearers the important virtues of truth, ju&s;tice, &s;obriety, charity, peace, loyalty and obedience, &s;o peculiarly ornamental to the chri&s;tian charac|ter, and &s;o eminently &s;ub&s;ervient to the public tranquility and happine&s;s. In a word:&mdash;Let us &s;ee to it that the genuine principles of the go&s;pel rule and govern in our hearts. This will make us faithful to our great ma&s;ter,&mdash;faithful to the be&s;t

intere&s;t of our people,&mdash;generous friends to our country, and warmly &s;olicitous to promote its welfare and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>To conclude:&mdash;As public-&s;pirit and love to our country is univer&s;ally incumbent on every member of &s;ociety, let all ranks and orders of men from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, be ambitious of this amiable character, and cordially unite their endeavours to promote the public happine&s;s. If we con&s;ider, my brethren, the very happy con&s;titution we are under, both civil and eccle&s;i|a&s;tical.&mdash;the mild and gentle form of our government, both in church and &s;tate, and the peculiar and di&s;tingui&s;hing privileges of a public nature we in this colony enjoy: As no people under heaven, have more rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied and plea&s;ed with their &s;ituation; &s;o none can po&s;&s;ibly be under &s;tronger obligations to maintain public-&s;pirit, and love to their country than we. We are not inthralled by lawle&s;s tyranny, or oppre&s;&s;ed with the galling yoke of de&s;potic and arbitrary rule. We have no temp|tation to wi&s;h for the wings of a dove, that we might quit our country, and fly away to &s;ome lonely de&s;ert and be at re&s;t. To Gallic &s;lavery, to Romi&s;h per&s;ecution and &s;piritual bondage, (ble&s;&s;ed be God,) we are utter &s;trangers. Still we ta&s;te the dear, the delightful &s;weets of liberty, in the free and unre&s;trained choice of our own rulers, as the return of this joyful anniver&s;ary, once more happily atte&s;ts. For a long time we have &s;at under the &s;weet and refre&s;hing &s;hade of the mantling vine. Let us not then, by our &s;ins and licentious conduct, provoke almighty God, "by whom kings reign," to &s;trip us of our dear privileges, and teach us, too late, the value of them, <Q>by the briars and thorns of the wilderne&s;s.</Q> On the contrary:&mdash;let each one, deeply &s;en&s;ible of the worth of the&s;e ine&s;timable privileges, &s;ee to it that they te&s;tify a proper regard for them, by a faithful, thankful and religious improvement of them. This will be the mo&s;t likely means, under divine providence, of their con|tinuance and perpetuation. Let us all do our faithful endeavour

to reform tho&s;e vices in our&s;elves, which are inimical to &s;ociety, and de&s;tructive of public happine&s;s, and then u&s;e our influence in our &s;everal &s;tations, to promote a general reformation. To do this our gracious &s;overeign, the father of his people, has earne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">y exhorted us from the throne. His royal proclamation, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Proclamation for the reformation of manners, publi&s;hed by his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty in the fir&s;t year of his reign.</NOTE> &s;econded by the chief authority of the colony, calls upon all ranks and orders in the &s;tate, to unite their endeavours, and engage, heart and hand, in this truly laudable de&s;ign. And how guilty, how inexcu&s;able will tho&s;e in &s;ubordinate authority,&mdash;will mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, and, in &s;hort, all the &s;ubjects be, if we neglect to concur with this pious intention of our rulers, and refu&s;e to engage in the &s;alutary work? How &s;hall we an&s;wer it to God or our own con&s;ciences, to the pre&s;ent age or po&s;terity, if, by our criminal neglect or abu&s;e of the&s;e rich ble&s;&s;ings, we make a forfeiture of them to God and the king? To prevent this, let all be exhorted to "put on charity" which is the great band of &s;ociety, and &s;pring of public-happi|ne&s;s. Let love to God, love to our country, and love to all mankind, ever reign in our hearts, and direct and govern all our actions. In particular, let us, above all things, be &s;olicit|ous to obtain the &s;aving ble&s;&s;ings of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, and have the various graces and virtues of the chri&s;tian character inwrought in our hearts and regulating our lives.&mdash;<Q>That &s;o &s;peaking the truth in love, we may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Chri&s;t: From whom the whole body, fitly joined together, and compacted, by that which every joint &s;upplieth, according to the effectual work|ing in the mea&s;ure of every part, maketh increa&s;e of the body unto the edifying of it&s;elf in love.</Q> <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Eph.
