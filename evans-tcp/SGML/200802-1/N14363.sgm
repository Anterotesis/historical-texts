<Q>And to make thee high above all nations, which he hath made in prai&s;e, and in name, and in honor; and that thou maye&s;t be an holy people unto the Lord thy God.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TAUGHT by the omni&s;cient Deity, Mo&s;es fore|&s;aw and predicted the capital events relative to I&s;rael, through the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive changes of depre&s;|&s;ion and glory, until their final elevation to the fir&s;t dig|nity and eminence among the empires of the world. The&s;e events have been &s;o ordered as to become a di&s;play of <HI>retribution</HI> and <HI>&s;overeignty;</HI> for while the <HI>good</HI> and <HI>evil,</HI> hitherto felt by this people, have been di&s;penced in the way of exact national retribution, their ultimate glory and ho|nor will be of the divine &s;overeignty, with a <HI>not for your &s;akes, do I this, &s;aith the Lord, be it known unto you&mdash;but for mine holy names &s;ake.</HI></P>
<P>However it may be doubted, whether political Com|munities are rewarded and puni&s;hed in this world only; and whether the pro&s;perity and decline of other Empires have corre&s;ponded with their moral &s;tate, as to virtue and vice: yet the hi&s;tory of the hebrew theocracy &s;hews, that the &s;ecular welfare of God's antient people depended upon
<PB N="6" REF="018198_0005_0FA5BF0921C52FF8">
their virtue, their religion, their ob&s;ervance of that holy covenant, which I&s;rael entered into with God, on the plains at the foot of Nebo on the other &s;ide Jordan. Here Mo|&s;es the man of God a&s;&s;embled three million of people, the number of the united &s;tates, recapitulated and gave them a &s;econd publication of the &s;acred jural in&s;titute, deliver|ed thirty-eight years before, with the mo&s;t awful &s;olemnity at mount Sinai. A Law dictated with &s;overeign autho|rity by the Mo&s;t High to a people, a world, a univer&s;e, becomes of invincible force and obligation without any reference to the con&s;ent of the governed:&mdash;it is obligato|ry for three rea&s;ons, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> its <HI>original ju&s;tice</HI> and unerring equity, the <HI>omnipotent Authority</HI> by which it is enforced, and the &s;anctions of <HI>rewards and puni&s;hments.</HI> But in the ca&s;e of I&s;rael, he conde&s;cended to a mutual covenant; and by the hand of Mo&s;es lead his people to avouch the Lord Jehovah to be their God, and in the mo&s;t public and explicit manner voluntarily to engage and covenant with God to keep and obey his Law. Thereupon this great prophet, whom God had rai&s;ed up for &s;o &s;olemn a tran&s;action, de|clared in the name of the Lord, that the Mo&s;t High avouched, acknowledged and took them for a peculiar people to him&s;elf; promi&s;ing to be their God and Protec|tor, and upon their obedience, to make them pro&s;perous and happy. Deut. xxix. 10 &amp; 14. C. xxx. 9 &amp; 19. He fore&s;aw indeed their rejection of God, and predicted the judicial cha&s;ti&s;ement of apo&s;tacy; a cha&s;ti&s;ement involving the righteous with the wicked. But as well to comfort and &s;upport the righteous in every age and under every cala|mity, as to make his power known among all nations, God determined that a remnant &s;hould be &s;aved. Whence Mo&s;es and the Prophets, by divine direction inter|&s;per&s;ed their writings with promi&s;es, that, when the ends of God's moral government &s;hould be an&s;wered in a &s;eries of national puni&s;hments, inflicted for a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages, he would by his irre&s;i&s;tible power and &s;overeign grace, &s;ub|due the hearts of his people to a free, willing, joyful obe|dience; <HI>turn</HI> their <HI>captivity;</HI>&mdash;recover and <HI>gather</HI> them <HI>from
<PB N="7" REF="018198_0006_0FA5BF0A4F214698">
all the nations whither the Lord had &s;cattered them in his fierce anger&mdash;bring</HI> them <HI>into the land which their fathers po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed&mdash;and multiply</HI> them <HI>above</HI> their <HI>fathers&mdash;and rejoice over</HI> them <HI>for good, as he rejoiced over</HI> their fathers. Deut. xxx. 3. Then the words of Mo&s;es, hitherto accompli&s;hed but in part, will be literally fulfilled; when this branch of the po&s;terity of Abraham &s;hall be nationally collected, and be|come a very di&s;tingui&s;hed and glorious people, under the great Me&s;&s;iah the Prince of Peace. He will then <HI>make</HI> them <HI>high above all nations which he hath made in prai&s;e, and in name, and in honor,</HI> and they &s;hall become <HI>a holy people unto the Lord</HI> their <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall enlarge no further upon the primary &s;en&s;e and literal accompli&s;hment of this and numerous other prophe|cies re&s;pecting both Jews and Gentiles, in the latter day glory of the church. For I have a&s;&s;umed the text, only as introductory to a di&s;cour&s;e upon the political welfare of God's American I&s;rael; and as allu&s;ively prophetic of the future pro&s;perity and &s;plendor of the United States. We may then con&s;ider</P>
<P>I. What rea&s;on we have to expect that, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, the&s;e States may pro&s;per and flouri&s;h into a great American Republic; and a&s;cend into high and di&s;tin|gui&s;hed honor among the nations of the earth. <HI>To make thee high above all nations, which he hath made in prai&s;e, and in name, and in honor.</HI></P>
<P>II. That our &s;y&s;tem of dominion and CIVIL POLITY would be imperfect, without the true RELIGION; or, that from the diffu&s;ion of virtue among the people of any com|munity, would ari&s;e their greate&s;t &s;ecular happine&s;s: which will terminate in this conclu&s;ion, that Holine&s;s ought to be the end of all civil government. <HI>That thou maye&s;t be an holy people unto the Lord thy God.</HI></P>
<P>I. The fir&s;t of the&s;e propo&s;itions will divide it&s;elf into two branches, and lead us to &s;hew,</P>
<P N="1">1. Wherein con&s;i&s;ts the true political welfare and pro&s;|perity,
<PB N="8" REF="018198_0007_0FA5BF0A777EB210">
and what the civil admini&s;tration nece&s;&s;ary for the elevation and advancement, of a people to the highe&s;t &s;e|cular glory.</P>
<P N="2">2. The rea&s;ons rendering it probable that the United States will, by the ordering of heaven, eventually become this people. But I &s;hall combine the&s;e together as I go along.</P>
<P>Dominion is founded in property; and re&s;ides where that is, whether in the hands of the few or many. The Dominion founded in the feudal tenure of e&s;tate, is &s;uit|ed to hold a conquered country in &s;ubjection, but is not adapted to the circum&s;tances of free citizens. Large ter|ritorial property ve&s;ted in individuals is pernicious to &s;o|ciety. Civilians, in contemplating the principles of go|vernment, have judged &s;uperior and inferior partition of property nece&s;&s;ary in order to pre&s;erve the &s;ubordination of &s;ociety, and e&s;tabli&s;h a permanent &s;y&s;tem of dominion. This makes the public defence the intere&s;t of a few land|holders only.</P>
<P>A free tenure of lands, an equable di&s;tribution of pro|perty, enters into the foundation of a happy State: &s;o far I mean, as that the body of the people may have it in their power, by indu&s;try, to become po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of real freehold fee-&s;imple e&s;tate. For connected with this will be a general &s;pirit and principle of &s;elf-defence&mdash;defence of our <HI>property, liberty, country.</HI> This has been &s;ingularly verified in New-England; where we have realized the capital ideas of Har|rington's Oceana.</P>
<P>But numerous <HI>population,</HI> as well as <HI>indu&s;try,</HI> is nece&s;&s;ary towards giving value to land, to judiciou&s;ly partitioned territory. The public weal requires the encouragement of both. A very incon&s;iderable value aro&s;e from the &s;par&s;e thin &s;ettlement of the American aboriginals; of whom there are not fifty thou&s;and &s;ouls on this &s;ide the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi. The prote&s;tant Europeans have generally bought the na|tive right of &s;oil, as far as they have &s;ettled, and paid the
<PB N="9" REF="018198_0008_0FA5BF0B6FCC3C90">
value ten fold; and are daily increa&s;ing the value of the re|maining Indian territory a thou&s;and fold: and in this man|ner we are a con&s;tant increa&s;ing revenue to the Sachems and original Lords of the Soil. How much mu&s;t the value of lands, re&s;erved to the natives of North and South-America, be increa&s;ed to remaining Indians, by the inhabitation of two or three hundred millions of Euro|peans?</P>
<P>Heaven hath provided this country, not indeed <HI>derelict,</HI> but only <HI>partially &s;ettled,</HI> and con&s;equently open, for the reception of a new enlargement of <HI>Japhet.</HI> Europe was &s;ettled by Japhet; America is &s;ettling from Europe: and perhaps this &s;econd enlargement bids fair to &s;urpa&s;s the fir&s;t: for we are to con&s;ider all the european &s;ettlements of America collectively as &s;pringing from, and transfu&s;ed with the blood of Japhet. Already for ages has Europe arrived to a plenary, if not declining population of 100 millions: in two or three hundred years this &s;econd enlargement may cover America with three times that number, if the pre&s;ent ratio of increa&s;e continues with the enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit of Americans for colonization and removing out into the wil|derne&s;s and &s;ettling new countries: and if Spain and Por|tugal &s;hould adopt that wi&s;e regulation re&s;pecting the con|nexion of the &s;exes, which would give a &s;pring to popula|tion within the tropics, equal to that without. There may now be <HI>three or four millions of Whites.</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Europeans, in North and South-America: of which one half are in rapid increa&s;e, and the re&s;t &s;carcely keeping their number good without &s;upplies from the parent &s;tates. The number of French, Spaniards, Dutch and Portugue&s;e, may be one million &s;ouls in all America; altho' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> have trans|fu&s;ed their blood into twice the number of Indians. The United States may be two million &s;ouls Whites, which have been an increa&s;e upon perhaps fewer than twenty or thirty thou&s;and families from Europe. Can we contem|plate their pre&s;ent, and anticipate their future increa&s;e, and not be &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;hment to find our&s;elves in the mid&s;t of the fulfilment of the prophecy of Noah? May we
<PB N="10" REF="018198_0009_0FA5BF0C1F6110D8">
not &s;ee that we are the object which the holy gho&s;t had in view four thou&s;and years ago, when he in&s;pired the ve|nerable Patriarch with the vi&s;ions re&s;pecting his po&s;terity? How wonderful the accompli&s;hments in di&s;tant and di&s;con|nected ages! While the principal increa&s;e was fir&s;t in Eu|rope, we&s;tward from <HI>Scythia,</HI> the re&s;idence of the family of Japhet, a branch of the original enlargement extending ea&s;tward into A&s;ia, and &s;preading round to the &s;outhward of the <HI>Ca&s;pian,</HI> became the ancient kingdoms of <HI>Media</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ia</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;. ant. lib. 1. c. 6.</NOTE>: and thus he dwelt in the tents of <HI>Shem.</HI> Hence the &s;ingular and almo&s;t identical affinity between the <HI>Per&s;ic</HI> and <HI>Teutonic</HI> languages through all ages to this day. And now the other part of the prophecy is fulfiling in a new enlargement, not in the tents of <HI>Shem,</HI> but in a country where <HI>Canaan &s;hall be his &s;ervant,</HI> at lea&s;t unto tri|bute.</P>
<P>I rather con&s;ider the American <HI>Indians</HI> as <HI>Canaanites</HI> of the expul&s;ion of Jo&s;hua: &s;ome of which in phoenician &s;hips coa&s;ted the Mediterranean to its mouth, as appears from an in&s;cription which they left there. <HI>Procopius</HI> who was born in Pale&s;tine, a ma&s;ter of the Phoenician and other oriental languages, and the hi&s;toriographer of the great <HI>Beli&s;arius,</HI> tells us, that at <HI>Tangier</HI> he &s;aw and read an in&s;cription upon two marble pillars there, in the <HI>ancient</HI> Phoenician (not the then modern Punic) letter, "<HI>We are they who have fled from the face of Jo&s;hua the robber, the &s;on of Nun.</HI>"<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibi ex albis lapidibus con&s;tant COLUMNAE DUAE prope mag|num &s;ontem erectae, phoenicios habentes characteres in&s;culptos, qui phoecicum lingua &s;ic &s;onant: NOS II SUMUS QUI FUGERUNT A FACIE JOSHUAE PRAEDONIS <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> NAUE.&mdash;Evagr. hi&s;t. ecc. l. 4. c. 18.

It is now known that A&s;ia is &s;eparated by water from America, as certainly appears from the Baron <HI>Dulfeldt'</HI>s voyage round the north of europe into the pacific ocean, A. D. 1769. Amid&s;t all the variety of national dialects, there reigns a &s;imilitude in their lan|guage, as there is al&s;o in complexion and beardle&s;s features, from <HI>Greenland</HI> to <HI>del&s;eugo,</HI> and from the <HI>Antilles</HI> to <HI>Otah|eite,</HI> which &s;hew them to be one people.</P>
<P>A few &s;cattered accounts, collected and combined toge|ther, may lead us to two certain conclu&s;ions, 1. That all the american Indians are one kind of people. 2. That they are the &s;ame as the people in the north-ea&s;t of A&s;ia.</P>
<P>An a&s;iatic territory, 3000 miles long and 1500 wide, above the 40th degree of latitude, to the hyperborean ocean, contains only one million of &s;ouls &s;ettled as our In|dians; as appears from the numerations and e&s;timates col|lected by <HI>M. Muller,</HI> and other Ru&s;&s;ian Academicians in 1769. The <HI>Koreki, Jakuhti</HI> and <HI>Tungu&s;ij</HI> living on the ea&s;tern part of this territory next to America, are naturally <HI>almo&s;t beardle&s;s,</HI> like the <HI>Samoi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ds</HI> in Siberia, the <HI>O&s;tia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> and <HI>Calmuks,</HI> as well as the <HI>American Indians:</HI> all the&s;e having al&s;o the &s;ame cu&s;tom of plucking out the few hairs of very thin beards. They have more &s;imilar u&s;ages and few|er di&s;&s;imilar ones, than the Arabians of the Korei&s;h tribe and Jews who &s;prang from Abraham: or than tho&s;e that &s;ub&s;i&s;t among the european nations, who &s;prang from one ance&s;tor; or the&s;e a&s;iatic nations, which &s;prang from Shem. The portrait painter Mr. Smibert, who accompanied Dr. Berkeley, then Dean of Derry and afterward Bi&s;hop of Cloyne, from Italy to America in 1728, was employ|ed by the grand Duke of Tu&s;cany, while at Florence, to
<PB N="12" REF="018198_0011_0FA5BF0D8A0110D0">
paint two or three Siberian Tartars, pre&s;ented to the Duke by the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia.</HI> This Mr. Smibert, upon his land|ing at Narragan&s;et-bay with Dr. Berkeley, in&s;tantly recog|nized the Indians here to be the &s;ame people as the Siberian Tartars who&s;e pictures he had taken. Moravian Indians from <HI>Greenland</HI> and <HI>South-America,</HI> have met tho&s;e in our latitude at Bethlehem, and have been clearly perceived to be the &s;ame people. The kam&s;chatdale Tartars have been carried over from A&s;ia to America, and compared with our Indians, and found to be the &s;ame people. The&s;e a&s;iatic Tartars, from whom the american aboriginals de|rived, are di&s;tinct from, and far le&s;s numerous, than the mongul and other Tartars which, for ages, under Tamer|lane and other chieftans, have deluged and over-ran the &s;outhern ancient A&s;iatic empires. Attending to the rational and ju&s;t deductions, from the&s;e and other di&s;connected data combined together, we may perceive, that all the Americans are one people&mdash;that they came hither <HI>certain|ly</HI> from the north-ea&s;t of A&s;ia; <HI>probably</HI> al&s;o from the me|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">terrane<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n; and if &s;o that they are canaanites, tho' arriving hither by different routs. The ocean current from the north of A&s;ia might waft the beardle&s;s <HI>Samoieds</HI> or <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">a&s;chi</HI> from the mouth of <HI>Jen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ea</HI> or the <HI>Oby,</HI> around <HI>Nova Zembla</HI> to <HI>Greenland,</HI> and thence to <HI>Labrador,</HI> many ages after the refugees from Jo&s;hua might have colonized the tropical regions. Thus Providence might have or|dered three divi&s;ions of the <HI>&s;ame people</HI> from different parts of the world, and perhaps in very di&s;tant ages, to meet to|gether on this continent, or, "<HI>our I&s;land,</HI>" as the &s;ix na|tions call it, to &s;ettle different parts of it, many ages before the pre&s;ent acce&s;&s;ion of Japhet, or the former vi&s;itation of <HI>Madoc,</HI> 1001, or the certain colonization from <HI>Nor|way</HI> A. D. 1001, as well as the certain chri&s;tianizing of Greenland in the ninth century; not to mention the vi&s;it of &s;till greater antiquity by the Phoenicians, who charged the Dighton rock and other rocks in Narragan&s;ett-bay with <HI>Punic</HI> in&s;criptions, remaining to this day. Which la&s;t I my&s;elf have repeatedly &s;een and taken off at large, as did

Profe&s;&s;or <HI>Sewall.</HI> He has lately tran&s;mitted a copy of this in|&s;cription to <HI>M. Gebelin</HI> of the <HI>Pari&s;ian</HI> academy of &s;ciences, who comparing them with the Punic paleography, judges them <HI>punic,</HI> and has interpreted them as denoting, that the ancient Carthaginians once vi&s;ited the&s;e di&s;tant regions.</P>
<P>Indians are numerous in the tropical regions, not &s;o el&s;ewhere. Baronla <HI>Hontan</HI> the la&s;t century, and Mr. Car|ver &s;o lately as 1776 and 1777, travelled north-we&s;t be|yond the &s;ources of the mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi. From their ob&s;erva|tions it appears that the ratio of indian population in the very heart of the continent, is &s;imilar to that on this &s;ide of the mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi. By an accurate numeration made in 1766, and returned into the plantation office in London, it ap|peared, that there were not <HI>forty</HI> thou&s;and &s;ouls, Indians, from the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi to the Atlantic, and from Florida to the Pole. According to Mr. Carver, there are about thirty,<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Carver's trav. p. 415.</NOTE> and certainly not forty Indian tribes, we&s;t of the Senecas, and &s;ix nation confederacy, and from the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ip|pi and Ohio northward to Hud&s;on's bay, and from Niaga|ra to the Lake of the Woods. The chiefs of all the&s;e &s;peak the Chipeway language. And perhaps all the remaining territory north of New Spain, and even on this &s;ide the northern tropic, and north-we&s;tward to a&s;ia, will not ex|hibit five times that number at highe&s;t.</P>
<P>Partly by actual numeration, and partly by e&s;timate, the Indians in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> dominions in America are con&s;i|dered as a million &s;ouls in New Spain, and a million and half in Peru, or two or three million &s;ouls in the whole. And perhaps this would fully comprehend tho&s;e of Para|guay and the Portugue&s;e provinces. In my opinion, great defalcation mu&s;t be made from the&s;e numbers. The abo|riginals have been injudiciou&s;ly e&s;timated at twenty mil|lions: but I believe they never exceeded two or three mil|lion &s;ouls in all North and South-America &s;ince the days of <HI>Columbus.</HI></P>

A monarchy conducted with <HI>infinite wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>infinite benevolence,</HI> is the mo&s;t perfect of all po&s;&s;ible go|vernments. The Mo&s;t High hath delegated power and authority to &s;ubordinate monarchies or &s;ole ruling powers, in limited di&s;tricts, throughout the cele&s;tial hierarchy, and through the immen&s;ity of the intellectual world; but at the &s;ame time he hath delegated and imparted to them, wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s adequate to the purpo&s;es of domini|on: and thence the government is, as it ought to be, ab|&s;olute. But in a world, or region of the univer&s;e, where God has imparted to none either this &s;uperior power or ade|quate wi&s;dom, beyond what falls to the common &s;hare of humanity, it is ab&s;urd to look for &s;uch qualities in one man; not even in the man <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> who &s;hared the govern|ment of I&s;rael with the Senate of Seventy. Therefore, there is no foundation for monarchical government, from &s;uppo&s;ed hereditary &s;uperiority in knowledge.

The &s;uppo&s;ed advantage of having <HI>one Public Head</HI> for all to look up to, and to concenter the attention, obedience, and affection of &s;ubjects, and to con&s;olidate the empire, will not counter-balance the evils of arbitrary de&s;poti&s;m, and the u&s;ual want of wi&s;dom in the &s;overeigns and poten|tates of the earth.

<P>The celebrated hi&s;torian Mrs. CATHARINE MACAULAY, that ornament of the republic of letters, and the female LIVY of the age, ob&s;erves, "The man who holds &s;upreme power for life, will have a great number of friends and ad|herents, who are attached by intere&s;t to his intere&s;t, and who will wi&s;h for continuance of power in the &s;ame family.

<P>In ju&s;tice to human &s;ociety, it may perhaps be &s;aid of almo&s;t all the polities and civil in&s;titutions in the world, however imperfect, that they have been founded in and carried on with very con&s;iderable wi&s;dom.

ARISTOCRACY, &s;tanding upon the annual elections of the people, and revocable at plea&s;ure, is the polity which combines the UNITED STATES: and from the na|ture of man, and the compari&s;on of ages, I believe it will approve it&s;elf the mo&s;t equitable, liberal, and perfect.</P>
<P>With the people, e&s;pecially a people &s;eized of proper|ty, re&s;ides the aggregate of original power. They cannot however a&s;&s;emble from the territory of an empire, and mu&s;t therefore, if they have any &s;hare in government, repre&s;ent them&s;elves by delegation. This con&s;titutes one order in legi&s;lature and &s;overeignty. It is a que&s;tion whether there &s;hould be any other. To re&s;olve which it may be con&s;i|dered, that each of the&s;e delegates or repre&s;entatives, will be faithful con&s;ervators of local intere&s;ts, but have no in|tere&s;t in attending exten&s;ively to the public, further than where all particular local intere&s;ts are affected in common with that which one delegate repre&s;ents in particular.</P>
<P>It &s;hould &s;eem then that the nature of &s;ociety dictates another, a higher Branch, who&s;e &s;uperiority ari&s;es from its being the intere&s;ted and natural <HI>con&s;ervator of the univer&s;al intere&s;t.</HI> This will be a &s;enatorial order, &s;tanding, not on local, but a general election of the whole body of the peo|ple. Let a bill, or law, be read in the one branch or the other: every one in&s;tantly thinks how it will affect his con&s;tituents. If his con&s;tituents are tho&s;e of one &s;mall di&s;trict only, they will be his fir&s;t care; if the people at large, their general or univer&s;al intere&s;t will be his fir&s;t care, the fir&s;t object of his faithful attention. If a &s;ena|tor, as in Delaware, &s;tands on the election of only the &s;ame di&s;trict as a deputy, the upper-hou&s;e is only a repetition of the lower:&mdash;if on the election of &s;everal counties com|bined, as in Virginia, each member of the upper-hou&s;e &s;tands and feels him&s;elf charged with a greater and more exten&s;ive care, than a member of the hou&s;e of burge&s;&s;es: not but that it is the duty of each deputy to attend to the general intere&s;t. Georgia, Penn&s;ylvania, and Jer&s;ey, have each a &s;enate or legi&s;lature of one order only; for although
<PB N="22" REF="018198_0021_0FA5BF18F1D8C1E8">
in Jer&s;ey it &s;eemeth otherwi&s;e, yet that intere&s;t which will determine a vote in one, will determine it in both hou&s;es. The &s;ame is true of the two Carolinas.</P>
<P>The con&s;titutions of Maryland and New-York, are founded in higher wi&s;dom. The polity of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts is excellent and truly grand. It retains indeed &s;ome of the &s;hadows of royalty, which may give dignity, but never operate an e&s;&s;ential mi&s;chief, in the hands of a chief magi|&s;trate, who is annually elective by the people at large. But Connecticut and Rhode-I&s;land have originally realized the mo&s;t perfect polity as to a legi&s;lature: any emendations and improvements may be made by the a&s;&s;embly with re|&s;pect to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the law courts, and a con&s;ti|tutional privy council, which in all future time will be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to attend the chief magi&s;trate in the ordinary civil admini&s;tration. The&s;e things are remedied in Virginia, who&s;e con&s;titution &s;eems to be imperfect in but one thing&mdash;its twenty-four &s;enators, though elected from local di&s;tricts, &s;hould be elected by the people at large, being men of &s;uch public eminence, and of merit &s;o illu&s;trious, as to be known not to a few only, but to all the tribes throughout the &s;tate. It e&s;tabli&s;hes judges <HI>quamdiu &s;e bene ge&s;&s;erint.</HI> It provides perfectly for <HI>legi&s;lation</HI> and <HI>law courts,</HI> for the <HI>mi|litia,</HI> and for that continual admini&s;tration of government in ab&s;ence of a&s;&s;emblies, and while the judiciary tribunals are &s;itting, which mu&s;t re&s;ide in and be uninterruptedly ex|erci&s;ed at the head of &s;overeignty in every civil polity.</P>
<P>It gives me plea&s;ure to find, that public LIBERTY is ef|fectually &s;ecured, in each and all the policies of the United States, though &s;omewhat differently modelled. Not only the polity or exterior &s;y&s;tem of government, but the laws and interior regulations of each &s;tate, are already excellent, &s;urpa&s;&s;ing the in&s;titutions of <HI>Lycurgus</HI> or <HI>Plato;</HI> and by the annual appeals to the public, a power is re&s;erved to the people, to remedy any corruptions or errors in government. And if even the people &s;hould &s;ometimes err, yet each a&s;|&s;embly of the &s;tates, and the body of the people, always embo&s;om wi&s;dom &s;ufficient to correct them&s;elves: &s;o that
<PB N="23" REF="018198_0022_0FA5BF1991E106C0">
a political mi&s;chief cannot be durable. Herein we far &s;ur|pa&s;s any &s;tates on earth. We can correct our&s;elves if in the wrong. The Belgic &s;tates in their foederal capacity, are united by a perfect &s;y&s;tem, con&s;tituted by that great prince WILLIAM of Na&s;&s;au, and the compatriots of that age: but they left the interior government of the jural tri|bunals, cities, and provinces, as depotic and arbitrary as they found them. So the elective monarchical republic of Poland, is an excellent con&s;titution for the nobles, but leaves de&s;poti&s;m and tyranny, the portion and hard fate of the plebeians, beyond what is to be found in any part of Europe. Not &s;o the American &s;tates: their interior as well as exterior civil and jural polities are &s;o nearly perfect, that the rights of individuals, even to numerous millions, are guarded and &s;ecured.</P>

<P>But I pa&s;s on to another &s;ubject in which the welfare of a community is deeply concerned, I mean the public RE|VENUES. National character and national faith depend on the&s;e.

entered into the &s;y&s;tem of Revenue and Finance in almo&s;t all nations, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> re&s;tricting the collection to money. Two or three millions can more ea&s;ily be rai&s;ed in produce, than one million in money. This collected and depo&s;ited in &s;tores and magazines, would by bills drawn upon the&s;e &s;tores, an&s;wer all the expenditures of war and peace. The little imperfect experiment lately made here, &s;hould not di&s;courage us. In one country it has been tried with &s;uc|ce&s;s for ages, I mean in China, the wi&s;e&s;t empire the &s;un hath ever &s;hined upon. And here, if I recollect aright, not a tenth of the Imperial revenues hath been collected in money. In rice, wheat and millet only are collected 40 million of &s;acks, one hundred and twenty each; equal to 80 million bu&s;hels: in raw and wrought &s;ilk one million pounds. The re&s;t is taken in &s;alt, wines, cotton, and other fruits of labor and indu&s;try at a certain ratio, <HI>per cent.</HI> and depo&s;ited in &s;tores over all the empire. The peri&s;hable commodities are immediately &s;old, and the <HI>mandarins</HI> and <HI>army</HI> are paid by bills on the&s;e magazines. In no part of the world are the inhabitants le&s;s oppre&s;&s;ed, than there. England has eleven hundred millions property, real per|&s;onal and commercial, and five million &s;ouls. Their or|dinary revenue has for many years been ten or twelve mil|lions; and during this war the national expenditures have been annually twenty millions. A great part is rai&s;ed by exci&s;e; by the land tax, not above a fifth or &s;ixth, altho' the annual rental of England is really &s;ixty millions. The funded debt has ari&s;en from 123 millions A. D. 1775, to 230 millions in 1783, and can never be paid. It is un|paralleled in the annals of empires, that &s;ix or &s;even milli|ons of people ever di&s;charged &s;o heavy a burden. The Roman Imperial debt was once in the times of the Cae&s;ars 300 millions &s;terling, when the empire con&s;i&s;ted of thirty million of people. One emperor at his acce&s;&s;ion wiped out twenty millions, and the <HI>Goths,</HI> and <HI>Vandals</HI> &s;ettled the re&s;t, to the ruin of thou&s;ands. May God pre&s;erve the&s;e States from being &s;o involved. The pre&s;ent war being over, the future increa&s;e of population and property will in time enable us, with convenience to di&s;charge the heavy debt we

have incurred in the defence of our rights and liberties. The United States have now two hundred and fifty millions of property, pretty equally &s;hared by two or three million people. And our national debt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">42 millions of dollars at the peace.</NOTE> is not ten million &s;ter|ling: which is to the whole collectively, as it would be for one man, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing an e&s;tate of &pound;. 250 in land and &s;tock, to oblige him&s;elf to pay ten pounds. The intere&s;t only of the Briti&s;h national debt, upon &s;ix or &s;even million people, is above ten millions &s;terling annually, that is, greater than the whole national debt of the United States, upon half that number. Our population will &s;oon over&s;pread the va&s;t territory from the Atlantic to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, which in two generations will become a property &s;uperior to that of Britain. Thus po&s;terity may help to pay for the war, which we have been obliged to fight out for them in our day. It will not, however, be wi&s;e to con&s;ign to po&s;terity &s;o heavy a debt; lea&s;t they &s;hould be tempted to learn, like other na|tions, the practice of public inju&s;tice, and broken nation|al faith.</P>
<P>Another object of great attention in America, will be <HI>Commerce.</HI> In order to form &s;ome ideas re&s;pecting it, in the united &s;tates, we may take a &s;ummary view of it, while we were in connexion with Britain; and thence judge what it may be, after we &s;hall have recovered from the &s;hock of this war.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h merchants repre&s;ented that they received &s;ome profit indeed from <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>South-Carolina,</HI> as well as the <HI>We&s;t-Indies:</HI> but as for the re&s;t of this conti|nent, they were con&s;tant loo&s;ers in trade. Mr. <HI>Clover</HI> has candidly di&s;clo&s;ed the truth; and he and other writers ena|ble us to form &s;ome ideas of the matter. It appears from an undecennary account laid before parliament in 1776, that the &s;tate of commerce between England only and

Engli&s;h America, for the eleven years preceding ho&s;tilities, was thus:

A commerce of 26 mil. exports, and only 13 mil. imports, is &s;elf-annihilated and impo&s;&s;ible. The returns from the We&s;t-Indies comprehended a great part of the continental remittances. The American merchants, by a circuitous trade from this continent, and from Africa, remitted to London and Britain, by way of the We&s;t-Indies, in bills of exchange drawn on &s;ugars, the balance of what they &s;eem to fall &s;hort, in direct remittances on the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e books.</P>
<P>The whole American commerce, monopolized by Great-Britain, mu&s;t be con&s;idered collectively; and was to Eng|land only in the above account 41 million exports, and 49 million imports. This inclu&s;ive of the 12 per cent. cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ged, amounted to a real annual profit of 32 per cent. to the Engli&s;h merchants in actual remittances of the year, be&s;ides a &s;tanding American debt, it is &s;aid of &s;ix millions carrying intere&s;t. Well might the Briti&s;h merchants &s;u&s;|tain a lo&s;s in American bankruptcies of a million a year (though probably at an average not five or ten thou&s;and) in &s;o lucrative a trade. An idea of the mercantile debt may be thus conceived. There is a di&s;trict within the uni|ted &s;tates, upon which the &s;tate of European trade, at the commencement of ho&s;tilities, was thus; being chiefly car|ried on by foreign factorages, a mode of commerce which the Briti&s;h merchants intended to have been univer&s;al. In the cour&s;e of a &s;y&s;tematical trade, had at length ari&s;en a &s;tanding debt of a million &s;terling among about a quarter of a million of people: to feed this the Briti&s;h merchants &s;ent over one quarter of a million &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">erling annually; for which and collected debts, they received in actual remittance half a million &s;terling within the &s;ame year, i. e. a quarter of a million returned half a million, and fed or kept up a debt
<PB N="29" REF="018198_0028_0FA5BF25F350FE50">
of one million, paying to Britain an annual lawful intere&s;t; the &s;ecurity of all which complicated &s;y&s;tem &s;tood upon american mortgages. This is true mercantile &s;ecret hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>If this &s;pecimen applied to all the &s;tates (and God be thanked it does not) it would &s;hew, not only the greatne&s;s and momentous importance of our trade to Europe, but the nece&s;&s;ity of legi&s;lative regulations in commerce, to inva|lidate future foreign mortgages, and yet &s;upport credit by the enforcement of punctual &s;peedy and certain payments, whether with profit or lo&s;s. Without this no permanent commerce can be &s;upported. I ob&s;erved that the above &s;pecimen may a&s;&s;i&s;t us. It is not nece&s;&s;ary for every pur|po&s;e, to come to great exactne&s;s in capital e&s;timates. The total exterior commerce of Great-Britain with all the world, is about twelve millions annually; of which five millions, or near half, was of American connexion, and four millions of this directly American, as Mr. Glover a&s;|&s;erts; and the real profits of the American trade was be|come to Britain equal to nearly half the benefit of her total exterior commerce to the whole world. The total of Bri|ti&s;h exports to all the world, A. D. 1704, was only &s;ix millions and an half &s;terling. The American Briti&s;h trade in its connexion, returns, and profits, nearly equalled this, A. D. 1774. We were better to Britain, than all the world was to her 70 years before. De&s;pi&s;ed as our com|merce was, it is evident, that had the union continued, our increa&s;ing millions would &s;oon have made remittances, for more than the fewer millions of Britain could have manu|factured for exportation. For the greater part of the manu|factures of every country mu&s;t be for dome&s;tic con&s;ump|tion. A &s;pecimen of this we have in the woollen manufac|ture. England grows eleven million fleeces a year, worth two million &s;terling, manufactured into eight million; of which &s;ix million is of dome&s;tic con&s;umption, and two mil|lion only for exportation. When it is con&s;idered that a great part of this went to other countries, how weak mu&s;t be the &s;uppo&s;ition that Britain cloathed America; while
<PB N="30" REF="018198_0029_0FA5BF2646DD1868">
America, from the beginning in their own dome&s;tic manu|factures, furni&s;hed nine-tenths of their apparel.</P>
<P>Our trade opens to all the world. We &s;hall doubtle&s;s at fir&s;t overtrade our&s;elves every where, and be in danger of incurring heavy mortgages unle&s;s prevented. The na|tions will not at fir&s;t know how far they may &s;afely trade with us. But commerce will find out its own &s;y&s;tem, and regulate it&s;elf in time. It will be governed on the part of America by the cheape&s;t foreign markets; on the part of Europe by our ability and punctuality of remittance. We can &s;oon make a remittance of three or four million a year in a circuitous trade, exclu&s;ive of the iniquitous African trade. If Europe &s;hould indulge us beyond this, our failures and di&s;appointments might lay the foundation of national animo&s;ities. Great wi&s;dom is therefore nece&s;&s;ary to regulate the commerce of America. The caution with which we are to be treated, may occa&s;ion and originate a commercial &s;y&s;tem among the maritime nations, on both &s;ides of the Atlantic, founded in ju&s;tice and reciprocity of intere&s;t, which will e&s;tabli&s;h the <HI>benevolence</HI> as well as the <HI>opulence</HI> of nations, and advance the progre&s;s of &s;ociety to civil perfection.</P>
<P>It is certainly for the benefit of every community that it be transfu&s;ed with the efficacious motives of <HI>univer&s;al in|du&s;try.</HI> This will take place if every one can enjoy the fruits of his labour and activity unmole&s;ted. All the va|riety of labour, in a well regulated &s;tate, will be &s;o ordered and encouraged, as that all will be employed in a ju&s;t propor|tion in agriculture, mechanic arts, commerce, and the li|terary profe&s;&s;ions. It has been a que&s;tion whether <HI>agricul|ture</HI> or <HI>commerce,</HI> needs mo&s;t encouragement in the&s;e &s;tates? But the motives for both &s;eem abundantly &s;ufficient. Ne|ver did they operate more &s;trongly than at pre&s;ent. The whole continent is activity, and in the lively vigorous exer|tion of indu&s;try. Several other things call for encourage|ment, as the planting of vineyards, and olive yards, and cotton walks; the rai&s;ing of wool, planting mulberry trees,
<PB N="31" REF="018198_0030_0FA5BF270DEACE20">
and the culture of &s;ilk; and I add, e&s;tabli&s;hing <HI>manufacto|ries.</HI> This la&s;t is nece&s;&s;ary, very nece&s;&s;ary, far more ne|ce&s;&s;ary indeed than is thought by many deep politicians. Let us have all the means po&s;&s;ible of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and ele|gance among our&s;elves, if we would be a flouri&s;hing re|public of real independent dignity and glory.</P>
<P>Another thing tending to the public welfare, is remo|ving cau&s;es of political animo&s;ities and civil di&s;&s;ention, pro|moting harmony, and &s;trengthening the union among the &s;everal parts of this extended community.

well as civil and military, even in the ages before St. PATRICK.</P>
<P>But to return:&mdash;The cultivation of LITERATURE will greatly promote the public welfare. In every community, while provi&s;ion is made, that all &s;hould be taught to read the &s;criptures and the very u&s;eful parts of common education, a good proportion &s;hould be carried through the higher branches of literature. Effectual mea&s;ures &s;hould be taken for pre&s;erving and diffu&s;ing knowledge among a people. The voluntary in&s;titution of libraries in different vicinities, will give tho&s;e, who have not a liberal education, an oppor|tunity of gaining that knowledge, which will qualify them for u&s;efulne&s;s. <HI>Travels, biography,</HI> and <HI>hi&s;tory,</HI> the know|ledge of the <HI>policies, jurisprudence,</HI> and &s;cientific improve|ments among all nations, antient and modern, will form the civilian, the judge, the &s;enator, the patrician, the man of u&s;eful eminence in &s;ociety. The colleges have been of &s;ingular advantage in the pre&s;ent day. When Britain withdrew all her wi&s;dom from America, this revolution found above two thou&s;and in New-England only, who had been educated in the colleges, intermixed among the peo|ple, and communicating knowledge among them. Almo&s;t all of them have approved them&s;elves u&s;eful; and there have been &s;ome characters among us of the fir&s;t eminence for literature. It would be for the public emolument &s;hould there always be found a &s;ufficient number of men in the community at large, of va&s;t and profound erudition, and perfect acquaintance with the whole &s;y&s;tem of public affairs, to illuminate the public councils, as well to fill the three learned profe&s;&s;ions with dignity and honor.</P>
<P>I have thus &s;hewn wherein con&s;i&s;ts the true political wel|fare of a civil community or &s;overeignty. The founda|tion is laid in a judicious di&s;tribution of property, and in a good &s;y&s;tem of <HI>polity</HI> and <HI>jurisprudence;</HI> on which will a|ri&s;e, under a truly patriotic, upright, and firm admini&s;tra|tion, the beautiful &s;uper&s;tructure of a well governed and pro&s;perous empire.</P>
<P>Already does the new con&s;tellation of the united &s;tates be|gin to realize this glory. It has already ri&s;en to an acknow|ledged

&s;overeignty among the republics and kingdoms of the world. And we have rea&s;on to hope, and I believe to expect, that God has &s;till greater ble&s;&s;ings in &s;tore, for this vine which his own right hand hath planted, to make us <HI>high among the nations in prai&s;e, and in name, and in honor.</HI> The rea&s;ons are very numerous, weighty, and conclu&s;ive.</P>
<P>In our civil con&s;titutions, tho&s;e impediments are removed, which ob&s;truct the progre&s;s of &s;ociety towards perfection: &s;uch, for in&s;tance, as re&s;pect the tenure of e&s;tates, and ar|bitrary government. The va&s;&s;alage of dependant tenures, the tokens of ancient conque&s;ts by Goths and Tartars, &s;till remain all over a&s;ia and europe. In this re&s;pect, as well as others, the world begins to open its eyes. One grand experiment in particular has lately been made. The pre|&s;ent empre&s;s of <HI>ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> by granting lands in freehold, in her va&s;t wilderne&s;&s;es of <HI>volkou&s;kile,</HI> together with religious li|berty, has allured and already draughted from <HI>poland</HI> and <HI>germany</HI> a colonization of &s;ix hundred thou&s;and &s;ouls in &s;ix years only, from 1762, to 1768.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mar&s;hal's trav.</NOTE></P>
<P>Liberty, civil and religious, has &s;weet and attractive charms. The enjoyment of this, with property, has fill|ed the engli&s;h &s;ettlers in america with a mo&s;t amazing &s;pirit, which has operated, and &s;till will operate with great energy. Never before has the experiment been &s;o effectually tried, of every man's reaping the fruits of his labor, and feeling his &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">re in the aggregate &s;y&s;tem of power. The antient republics did not &s;tand on the people at large; and there|fore no example or precedent can be taken from them.

<P>Our degree of population is &s;uch as to give us rea&s;on to expect that this will become a great people. It is probable that within a century from our independence the &s;un will

<P>I am &s;en&s;ible &s;ome will con&s;ider the&s;e as vi&s;ionary uto|pian ideas.

As vi&s;ionary that the twenty thou&s;and &s;ouls which fir&s;t &s;ettled new-england, &s;hould be multiplied to near a million in a century and a half. As vi&s;ionary that the ottoman empire mu&s;t fall by the ru&s;&s;ian. As vi&s;ionary to the catholics is the certain downfal of the pontificate.

a force brought again&s;t us; which might have made any empire on earth to tremble&mdash;and yet our bow has abode in &s;trength; and having obtained help of God, we continue unto this day. Forced unto the la&s;t <HI>&s;olemn appeal,</HI> america watched for the fir&s;t blood: this was &s;hed by <HI>britons</HI> on the 19th of April, 1775; which in&s;tantly &s;prung an army of 20,000 into &s;pontaneous exi&s;tence, with the enterprizing and daring, if imprudent, re&s;olution of entering <HI>bo&s;ton,</HI> and forceably di&s;burdening it of its bloody legions. Every pa|triot trembled till we had proved our armour, till it could be &s;een, whether this ha&s;ty concour&s;e was &s;u&s;ceptible of ex|ercitual arrangement, and could face the enemy with firm|ne&s;s. They early gave us the decided proof of this, in the memorable battle of <HI>bunker-hill.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">June 17, 1775.</NOTE> We were &s;atisfied. This in&s;tantly convinced us, and for the fir&s;t time convinced <HI>bri|tons</HI> them&s;elves, that americans both would and could fight with great effect. Whereupon Congre&s;s put at the head of this &s;pirited army, the only man, on whom the eyes of all i&s;rael were placed. Po&s;terity, I apprehend, and the world it&s;elf, incon&s;iderate and incredulous as they may be of the dominion of heaven, will yet do &s;o much ju&s;tice to the divine moral government, as to acknowledge, that this american JOSHUA was rai&s;ed up by God, and <HI>divinely form|ed</HI> by a peculiar influence of the Sovereign of the Univer&s;e, for the great work of leading the armies of this american Jo|&s;eph (now &s;eparated from his brethren), and conducting this people through the &s;evere, the arduous conflict, to li|berty and independence. Surprizing was it with what in|&s;tant celerity men a&s;cended and ro&s;e into generals, and offi|cers of every &s;ubordination; formed chiefly by the prepa|ratory di&s;cipline of only the preceding year 1774; when the ardor and &s;pirit of military di&s;cipline was by heaven, and without concert, &s;ent through the continent like lightning. Surprizing was it, how &s;oon the army was organized, took its formation, and ro&s;e into firm &s;y&s;tem and impregnable arrangement.</P>
<P>To think of with&s;tanding and encountering britain by land was bold, and much more bold and daring, by &s;ea:
<PB N="38" REF="018198_0037_0FA5BF2C357E1780">
yet we immediately began a navy, and built &s;hips of war with an unexampled expedition. It is pre&s;umed never was a 35 gun &s;hip before built quicker than that well built, no|ble &s;hip the <HI>Raleigh,</HI> which was fini&s;hed from the keel and equipt for &s;ea in a few months.

Ireland has become gloriou&s;ly independent of england. Nor will the &s;pirit re&s;t, till <HI>&s;cotland</HI> becomes independent al&s;o. It would be hap|pier for the three kingdoms, to &s;ub&s;i&s;t with parliaments and national councils independent of one another, although confederated under one monarch. The union of 1707 has produced the lo&s;s and di&s;memberment of america. It is ju&s;t po&s;&s;ible, that within this age, &s;ome ill-fated coun&s;ellor of another connexion, might have ari&s;en, and prompted maje&s;ty and parliament to &s;anguinary mea&s;ures again&s;t america: but it is more than probable, that their enforce|ment would have been deferred, or procra&s;tinated a century hence, or to a period when our accumulated population would have dictated wi&s;er, milder mea&s;ures, to the briti&s;h court; and &s;o america, by a gentle, fraternal connexion, would have remained cemented to britain for di&s;tant ages. But a rehoboam coun&s;ellor &s;tept in, <HI>et actum e&s;t de republica</HI>&mdash;the ten tribes are lo&s;t.

Chagrined and mortified by the defeat and di&s;honor brought upon them by Butean councils and do|minion, as well as with their curtailed and unequal weight in parliament, <HI>&s;cotland,</HI> emulous of the glory of <HI>ireland,</HI> will wi&s;h for and obtain a di&s;&s;olution of the union, and re|&s;ume a &s;eparate &s;overeignty.

<P>The invalidity of our <HI>ordinations</HI> is objected again&s;t us, and &s;o of con&s;equence the invalidity of all our official admi|ni&s;trations. And now that we are upon the matter, give me leave to exhibit a true, though &s;ummary &s;tate of it, as the re&s;ult of a very full, laborious, and thorough inquiry. It was the mi&s;taken opinion of &s;ome of our fir&s;t mini&s;ters in new-england (than whom, there never was a more learned collection, for they embo&s;omed all the theological and ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical erudition of all ages), it was, I &s;ay, their opi|nion, that the power of ordination of all church officers, was in the church, by their elders. They well knew, from eccle&s;ia&s;tical and &s;cripture antiquity, that the power of election was there; and they judged ordination the le&s;&s;er act: but their great rea&s;on was, that the church might not be controlled by any exterior authority, whether epi&s;|copal or pre&s;byterial, and &s;o no more be harra&s;&s;ed by bi|&s;hops courts, or any other &s;imilar tribunals. Our fathers held to an elder&s;hip, for they &s;aw it in all antiquity, as well as the bible: and it was their judgment, that elders &s;hould be ordained by elders of the &s;ame church. The mo&s;t of
<PB N="60" REF="018198_0059_0FA5BF444F57DB40">
the fir&s;t forty churches had ruling elders; a few had not. The&s;e few created an early difficulty; on which our fathers early made a mi&s;taken deci&s;ion, that where there were no elders in the church, ordination might be done by the lay|ing on of hands of delegated brethren. The introduction of mini&s;ters, already ordained, into the pa&s;toral charge of a particular church, was at fir&s;t done by lay-brethren; and this was, from the beginning, <HI>improperly</HI> called <HI>ordi|nation,</HI> how often &s;oever repeated. A repetition of ordina|tions or bapti&s;ms, does not nullify the fir&s;t regular admini|&s;trations. All the fir&s;t new-england mini&s;ters were ordain|ed before. Thus Mr. Wil&s;on was fir&s;t ordained by a bi|&s;hop in england; then 1630 by governor <HI>Winthrop</HI> and others he was ordained <HI>teacher</HI> in <HI>bo&s;ton;</HI> he then ordained an elder: and upon the acce&s;&s;ion of Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> 1633, he was, by this elder and governor <HI>Winthrop,</HI> again, a third time, ordained and con&s;tituted pa&s;tor. So the learned and courtly Mr. <HI>Davenport</HI> was ordained by a bi&s;hop, then by the brethren, pa&s;tor of the church in new-haven, in 1639; and 1668, was again ordained, pa&s;tor of the fir&s;t church in <HI>bo&s;ton,</HI> by elder <HI>Penn.</HI> Mr. Hooker was ordained a pre&s;by|ter by a bi&s;hop in england, and then again by the brethren at <HI>Newtown,</HI> 1633, who removed with his church to hart|ford.

and this was done by the advice, and under the in&s;pection of mini&s;ters ordained by the bi&s;hops in england, one of whom prayed at the &s;olemnity of the con&s;ecration, and all gave their approbation and right hand of fellow&s;hip; which in my opinion, amounts to their performing the ordination them&s;elves, they being pre&s;ent and a&s;&s;i&s;ting in the tran&s;ac|tion. This was at <HI>woburn,</HI> 1642.

<P>Immediately upon publi&s;hing the cambridge platform, 1648, our brethren in england remon&s;trated again&s;t allow|ing lay-ordination.

The&s;e arguments convinced our fa|thers, and they immediately &s;et about to remedy the prac|tice, which had hitherto, providentially, wrought no mi&s;|chief, as the body of the pa&s;tors had been ordained by bi|&s;hops. It in&s;tantly became a cu&s;tom for &s;ome of the or|dained mini&s;ters pre&s;ent to lay on hands in ordinations, it being for &s;ome time judged nece&s;&s;ary, that the delegated brethren &s;hould join, in token of &s;ubjection of the church to the pa&s;toral care of the mini&s;ter. But at length it be|came a cu&s;tom, &s;o early as before 1660, that, at the de&s;ire of the church, the ordaining mini&s;ters performed the whole, both conferred office-power on the pa&s;tor elect, by the lay|ing on of hands, and committed the church to his pa&s;toral charge; which, with the joint fellow&s;hip of the pa&s;tors and churches, fini&s;hed the ordination. Thus ordinations were recovered into their right &s;tate and order, the la&s;t century, and before lay-ordinations had wrought any evil. Thus office-power, by &s;cripture pre&s;byters, continued to be tran&s;|fu&s;ed

through the clergy. I have rea&s;on and even a&s;&s;u|rance to believe, that there was no candidate ordained in new-england, before 1746, but who&s;e ordination may be traced to the bi&s;hops in england. I have found no in|&s;tance to the contrary, although I have &s;earched and exa|mined all the ordinations of the fir&s;t half century here, and mo&s;t of them for the fir&s;t hundred years. And as to the wild and enthu&s;ia&s;tic period between 1740 and 1750, though it gave birth to perhaps thirty little <HI>&s;eparate</HI> con|gregations, yet &s;ome have di&s;&s;olved, others become regu|lar, and the ten or a dozen now remaining, are more and more convinced of the duty of &s;eeking ordination from among the &s;tanding mini&s;ters. And it is remarkable, that Mr. <HI>Thomas Denni&s;on,</HI> now living, a&s;&s;i&s;ted, laid on hands, and gave the charge at the fir&s;t ordination, in 1746, and at the three &s;ucceeding ordinations among the <HI>&s;eparates</HI> in new-england, from whence all the ordinations in the churches of that de&s;cription have proceeded. And although in the fir&s;t, but not in the others, he acted as a brother delegated by the church, and in the others as an elder of another church, yet it is remarkable, I &s;ay, that he him&s;elf had been ordained, in 1743, by one, who&s;e ordination I have traced to the <HI>Mathers,</HI> and other <HI>bo&s;ton</HI> mini&s;ters, and through them up to the bi&s;hop of <HI>che&s;ter,</HI> and other bi&s;hops in <HI>england.</HI> It is probable the few &s;eparate churches re|maining, will, in time, become regular, by &s;eeking ordina|tions among the pa&s;tors of the &s;tanding churches, where the ordinations are indubitable.</P>
<P>For, as I have &s;aid, the ordination of our clergy is regu|lar and &s;criptural, and may be traced, in the line of pre&s;|byters, up to the apo&s;tolic age: and &s;o in general may the ordinations, in this line, through the whole chri&s;tian world, e&s;pecially in the great divi&s;ions of <HI>lutherans, calvini&s;ts,</HI> and <HI>church</HI> of <HI>england.</HI> So wonderfully has Chri&s;t pre&s;erved the &s;acerdotal or pre&s;byterian order in the church, that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in this line is without a doubt.

<P>Thus, in this mo&s;t valuable piece or reject of eccle&s;i|a&s;tical antiquity, we have pre&s;erved and tran&s;mitted to us a &s;pecimen and exemplar of a truly primitive and apo&s;tolic church. And herein we have a full proof, that while there were fifteen hundred <HI>pa&s;tors</HI> or <HI>Ka&s;hi&s;ha,</HI> yet there were no bi&s;hops in egypt in the po&s;terior appropriate &s;en&s;e of the <HI>latin</HI> and <HI>greek</HI> churches, until the fourth century: altho' the chri&s;tians had by that time become &s;o numerous in egypt, that in the mo&s;t &s;evere and memorable per&s;ecution under <HI>maximianus,</HI> the predece&s;&s;or of Con&s;tantine the great, one hundred thou&s;and chri&s;tians were put to death there, and &s;even hundred thou&s;and were &s;old for &s;laves! a barbarity which &s;atiated and glutted the malice of per&s;ecution, and wrought a conviction in the whole roman empire, of the impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;ubduing chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>Corre&s;pondent to this idea of a church and its officers was the form particularly of the church of <HI>ephe&s;us,</HI> and the &s;even churches of <HI>a&s;ia,</HI> in the apo&s;tolic age; and the churches of new-england; wherein at their primitive in&s;ti|tutions, were originally two or more elders, be&s;ides the pa&s;tors and teachers, i. e. four pre&s;byters: although, ha|ving generally, though not univer&s;ally, dropt the ruling elders, they now more nearly re&s;emble the church of <HI>phi|lippi,</HI>

in having, at pre&s;ent, only bi&s;hops and deacons. It might, however, be well to re&s;ume the elder&s;hip as in the days of our ance&s;tors.</P>

<P>If men, not merely nominally chri&s;tians, but of real re|ligion and &s;incere piety, joined with abilities, were advan|ced and called up to office in every civil department, how would it countenance and recommend virtue?

But after the pre&s;ent period of dei&s;m and &s;ceptical indif|ferenti&s;m in religion, of timidity and irre&s;olution in the cau&s;e of the great <HI>Emmanuel,</HI> perhaps there may ari&s;e a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of civil magi&s;trates, who will not be a&s;hamed of the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, nor of patronizing his holy religion; with a generous catholici&s;m and expanded benevolence to|wards all of every denomination, who love our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t in &s;incerity and truth; patronizing it, I repeat, not with the in&s;idious views of a <HI>Hutchin&s;onian</HI> policy, but from a rational and firm belief and love of evangelical truth.

<P>Whenever religion is erected on the ruins of civil govern|vernment; and when civil government is built on the ruins of religion, both are &s;o far e&s;&s;entially wrong. The church has never been of any political detriment here, for it never has been ve&s;ted with any civil or &s;ecular power in new-eng|land: although it is certain, that civil dominion was but the &s;econd motive, religion the primary one with our ance&s;|tors, in coming hither and &s;ettling this land. It was not &s;o much their de&s;ign to e&s;tabli&s;h religion for the benefit of the &s;tate as civil government for the benefit of religion, and as &s;ub&s;ervient, and even nece&s;&s;ary towards the peace|able enjoyment and unmole&s;ted exerci&s;e of religion&mdash;of that religion, for which they fled to tho&s;e ends of the earth.

An in&s;titution is not made for the laws, but the laws for the in&s;titution.

<P>This was the &s;y&s;tem of theology brought over from the other &s;ide of the flood, by our pious forefathers, now with God.

If chri&s;tians are wicked, and even &s;hould they &s;urpa&s;s the gentiles in vice, their religion never taught them &s;o.

<P>That &s;enatorial order mu&s;t be truly important, which &s;tands upon the general voice and election of the public at large, becau&s;e it mu&s;t comprehend men of &s;uch public and con&s;picuous merit, as to be known among all our tribes, men of approved <HI>patrioti&s;m</HI> and <HI>wi&s;dom,</HI> as well as <HI>popularity.</HI> We e&s;teem it our happine&s;s that our GOVER|NORS and our NOBLES proceed from our&s;elves. When we con&s;ider the trifling and inferior characters of the mo&s;t of the venal coun&s;ellors in the late royal governments, when compared with the &s;olid wi&s;dom of the council of this &s;tate, we may be convinced that a legi&s;lature, &s;tanding up|on the free election of the people to be governed, bids fair to en&s;ure more wi&s;dom and incorruptibility, than if in the appointment of the mo&s;t augu&s;t &s;overeigns in the world.</P>

<P>The general anniver&s;ary election dictates annually the general &s;en&s;e of the community.

<P>The college has often &s;ince its foundation,* experienced the liberality and &s;miles of the general a&s;&s;embly; for which it is always ready to return and repeat its thanks and gra|titude.

<P>I have not a&s;&s;umed upon me to dictate to the civil <HI>ma|gi&s;tracy,</HI> nor do I dictate to the <HI>&s;acerdotal</HI> order: albeit I might &s;peak to the mo&s;t of my brethren pre&s;ent, as being &s;uch an one in years, as Paul the aged.

<P>Permit me then to &s;ay, that, while we do not fail to in|culcate obedience to the magi&s;tracy and laws, and recom|mend to our people the election of a pious magi&s;tracy; our principal work is not &s;ecular but &s;piritual and divine. Let us with the greate&s;t a&s;&s;iduity devote our&s;elves to our Lord's work, as amba&s;&s;adors of the Prince of Peace. Let us preach the divinity and un&s;earchable riches of Chri&s;t, and &s;alvation by his atonement; that theological &s;y&s;tem, which places the whole of redemption upon free grace&mdash;a grace free as to us, tho' merited by the holy Redeemer. Let us &s;earch the &s;criptures for the real evangelical verity: and inquire, not &s;o much for new theories in divinity, as what truths were known and realized in <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>life,</HI> by the primitive chri&s;tians of the apo&s;tolic age, and the three fir&s;t centuries; and believe that no other &s;y&s;tem, no other doc|trines are e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to carry men to heaven in the&s;e ages, than tho&s;e which enabled the myriads of holy martyrs to &s;eal the te&s;timony of Je&s;us with their blood.</P>
<P>There is but one true &s;y&s;tem of theology, and this has been equally known in all the chri&s;tian ages. For altho'
<PB N="96" REF="018198_0095_0FA5BF66D61C7238">
great improvements and di&s;coveries are daily making in philo&s;ophy and natural &s;cience, yet there have been no new di&s;coveries in divinity, &s;ince the apo&s;tolic age: I do not mean merely no new revelation, but of the innumerable latent truths concealed in the bible (and there are infinite|ly greater trea&s;ures hidden there than in nature) none have been percieved in later ages, but what have been as clearly di&s;cerned by the contemplative theologians of all ages. The &s;entiments are the &s;ame, tho' cloathed in different dic|tion. Philo&s;ophy, as I &s;aid, is improving, nor has the progre&s;s of civil &s;ociety yet reached its &s;ummit: but divi|nity, I apprehend, has been long at a &s;tand, having ages ago come to the highe&s;t perfection intended us at pre&s;ent by heaven; which did not de&s;ign any further improve|ment in it, from the &s;ealing of the vi&s;ion till the &s;econd coming of Chri&s;t. In the millenium the&s;e hidden trea|&s;ures will be brought forth. But for the preceding period, divinity will be and remain at a &s;tand, except perhaps that towards the clo&s;e of it, the prophecies will di&s;clo&s;e them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>Religion has had and will have different fa&s;hions, even where it is &s;till e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame. Previous to the tenth century, the writings of St. <HI>Augu&s;tin</HI> gave an exten&s;ive complexion to theology: afterwards <HI>Lombard'</HI>s collection of &s;entences o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> opinions of evangelical divines: but he was &s;hoved into neglect by <HI>Aquinas,</HI> who reigned umpire till the reformation. <HI>Luther</HI> followed <HI>Augu&s;tin,</HI> and <HI>Calvin Aquinas.</HI> The real theology of <HI>Melancthon, Calvin,</HI> arch|bi&s;hop <HI>Cranmer</HI> and <HI>Owen,</HI> was one and the &s;ame.</P>
<P>We de&s;pi&s;e the <HI>fathers</HI> and the pious and learned divines of the <HI>middle</HI> ages: pious po&s;terity will do the &s;ame by us; and twirl over our mo&s;t favorite authors with the &s;ame ignorant pity and neglect:&mdash;happy they, if their favorite authors contain the &s;ame ble&s;&s;ed truths.</P>
<P>I rejoice that God has hitherto pre&s;erved a learned and evangelical mini&s;try in the&s;e churches. The theology in general reception, comprehends all the excellent things of
<PB N="97" REF="018198_0096_0FA5BF67766E18E8">
our common chri&s;tianity. And if &s;ome favorite <HI>hurekas,</HI> &s;ome fancied di&s;coveries, &s;hould be burnt up in the day of the Lord, yet there will be left as great an abundance of precious &s;tones, of the tried and pure gold of truth, as in any part of the world. Indeed we have gotten all the light of chri&s;tendom, and we need no more. We have enough: we are wealthy in &s;acred knowledge. We may &s;pend long lives, in making our&s;elves ma&s;ters of that va&s;t trea&s;ure of &s;acred wi&s;dom, which holy men of great light have attained. May I comprehend with all &s;aints the height and depth of this knowledge, may my God po&s;&s;e&s;s me of this trea&s;ure, and I am content. All this know|ledge, to the greate&s;t extent of the human limit, has been gotten and acquired over and over again and again. Like other &s;cience, to every generation it &s;eems new, while it is only po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the knowledge familiar to our predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>Moreover, charity, union and benevolence are peculiar|ly ornamental in the mini&s;terial order. Let us cheri&s;h the&s;e amiable graces in our&s;elves and others. Let us be faithful. And the nearer we come to the &s;olemn moment when we mu&s;t render our account to God the Judge, the more may we be quickened and animated in the mini&s;try: and think no labor, no a&s;&s;iduity too great, nothing too much to be done for the &s;alvation of precious and immor|tal &s;ouls, nothing too much for the cau&s;e and kingdom of him who hath loved us to the death.
