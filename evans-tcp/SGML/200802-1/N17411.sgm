<P>MOSES gave an early and noble &s;pecimen of genuine patrio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;m, when he cho&s;e rather to abide the fate of his nation, and take a part with them, than to be reputed the &s;on of <HI>Thermu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">his</HI> the daughter of <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> though with the pro&s;pect of a&s;cending the throne of one of the mo&s;t ancient, &s;plendid and powerful nations of the earth. And ever after he was divinely appointed to conduct the <HI>Hebrews</HI> out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> to the day of this death; he manife&s;ted a warm and con&s;tant affection to that people, and an animated de&s;ire to promote their tranquility and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT in nothing did <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> demon&s;trate his love to his nation more, than in that wi&s;e &s;y&s;tem of laws which he ap|pointed them, &s;o admirably calculated to &s;ub&s;erve their great|e&s;t political intere&s;t and pro&s;perity&mdash;this he admoni&s;hes them of in our text, the plain meaning of which is, "That religion, or a practical attention to that &s;y&s;tem of moral and religious in&s;titutions revealed from Heaven, will always promote the be&s;t intere&s;ts of human &s;ociety, and prove the greate&s;t &s;ocial ble&s;&s;|ing to mankind." And it is an happy con&s;ideration, that the religion GOD has been plea&s;ed to reveal to us, is not only rational, entertaining and &s;ublime in it&s;elf, and calculated to promote the tranquility of individuals, and their utmo&s;t ment|al plea&s;ure&mdash;but al&s;o to encourage and perfect the order, har|mony and happine&s;s of human &s;ociety.</P>
<P>THE benign a&s;pect of religion upon human &s;ociety, and national pro&s;perity and happine&s;s, being principally intended by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in the text, I &s;hall &s;pecially in&s;i&s;t on this idea in the &s;ub&s;equent di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>AND that religion is a great and ine&s;timable &s;ocial ble&s;&s;ing
<PB N="6" REF="022505_0005_0FB94768DD1F7D78">
to mankind, and admirably adapted to render a nation peace|ful and pro&s;perous, may be confirmed and illu&s;trated, whether we con&s;ider the nature and tendency of religion, or the holy, wi&s;e and ju&s;t providence of GOD, which &s;uperintends all the affairs of mankind.</P>
<P N="1">I. THE nature and tendency of religion are &s;uch, as have the mo&s;t benign and friendly a&s;pect upon civil &s;ociety.</P>
<P>ALL tho&s;e virtues and graces which are recommended in our holy religion, are happily &s;ub&s;ervient to the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tan|tial intere&s;ts of civil communities.</P>
<P>AN inviolable regard to truth and fidelity, ju&s;tice and equity, &s;o much in&s;i&s;ted upon, both in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian religion,</HI> is very nece&s;&s;ary to the well being of &s;ociety&mdash;as we &s;hould pre&s;ently be convinced, by too &s;ad experience, were in&s;incerity and fal&s;ehood, inju&s;tice and fraud, to be &s;ub&s;tituted in&s;tead of tho&s;e virtues, and introduced into general practice.&mdash;Temper|ate and cha&s;te affections towards our neighbours&mdash;indu&s;try and diligence in our re&s;pective occupations&mdash;the&s;e are excellent virtues in communities, and tend to render &s;ocial life peaceful and happy.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Hebrew Lawgiver</HI> recommended a profound venera|tion for JEHOVAH, as the creator, pre&s;erver and governor of the world; who is repre&s;ented, in the religious in&s;titution of the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> as &s;uperintending, by his wi&s;e, holy and ju&s;t pro|vidence, all the affairs of mankind; he commanded chil|dren and youth to exerci&s;e a filial and honorable regard to their earthly parents and &s;uperiors, affability towards equals, and courteou&s;ne&s;s to all; he required the <HI>Hebrews</HI> to maintain a &s;acred regard to the lives and health of their neighbours&mdash;to be temperate and cha&s;te in their affections and whole de|portment&mdash;not to intrude upon each other's property&mdash;to pre|&s;erve an inviolable regard to truth in all their &s;ocial intercour&s;e, e&s;pecially in matters of witne&s;s&mdash;to permit their neighbour the unmole&s;ted and uncoveted po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and enjoyment of his wi&s;e, his hou&s;e, his field, his man&s;ervant, his maid&s;ervant, his ox, his a&s;s, and every part of his property.&mdash;How excel|lently well qualified were the&s;e <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> in&s;titutions to render the <HI>Hebrew</HI> civil &s;tate happy! to promote peace and good order,
<PB N="7" REF="022505_0006_0FB9476EC233DBA8">
union and tranquility&mdash;in&s;pire friend&s;hip and mutual confid|ence&mdash;and to diffu&s;e a &s;pirit of piety towards GOD, and of ju&s;tice and equity, truth and fidelity, benevolence and charity, through all the politic body! With great propriety there|fore did Mo&s;es declare that <HI>I&s;rael</HI>'s attention to tho&s;e laws he had given them "was not a vain thing for them; becau&s;e it was their life:" and that "through this thing they &s;hould prolong their life, or days, in the land whither they went over <HI>Jordan</HI> to po&s;&s;e&s;s it."</P>
<P>RELIGION is admirably adapted to &s;oothe the pa&s;&s;ions, calm the re&s;entments and animo&s;ities, and meliorate the tem|pers of mankind, and prepare the human nature to reli&s;h the &s;weets of &s;ociety and friend&s;hip. But I wi&s;h to be a little more diffu&s;ive.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t</HI>&mdash;RELIGION enjoins upon Kings, Princes, and all Ma|gi&s;trates, to rule in the fear of JEHOVAH, the Supreme Mon|arch of the univer&s;e; it teaches them that they are accounta|ble to the GOD of Heaven in their political characters, though they may be called gods on earth; religion al&s;o renders a Magi&s;trate augu&s;t and venerable in the eyes of the people, and therefore gives &s;trength and &s;tability to his authority and laws; Many <HI>vicious</HI> Princes and Magi&s;trates have indeed obtained &s;uch a degree of <HI>authority</HI> over their people, as to <HI>compel</HI> them, through <HI>fear</HI> and <HI>dread,</HI> to yield a <HI>temporary</HI> and <HI>hypocritical</HI> compliance with their laws and government; but how prefer|able is that obedience and ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s of a people, who are allured and enticed to obey, by the &s;hining examples of vir|tue, religion and patrioti&s;m, which they daily have pre&s;ented them by their Princes and Rulers!</P>
<P><HI>Secondly</HI>&mdash;As religion teaches Princes and Magi&s;trates to rule in the fear of GOD, &s;o al&s;o doth it inform them that the emolument and happine&s;s of the people form the great law of reigning, and the grand de&s;ign of the Magi&s;trate's authority. Religion, both <HI>Hebrew</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> teaches civil Rulers to promote and cheri&s;h the &s;ocial wor&s;hip of GOD&mdash;to found and endow &s;chools and &s;eminaries of learning&mdash;and to adopt and improve every wi&s;e and benevolent mea&s;ure for the encourage|ment of virtue and literature among their people.&mdash;Literature
<PB N="8" REF="022505_0007_0FB9477060646F48">
and religion have generally been e&s;teemed mo&s;t worthy and important objects of the attention of civil Rulers, even among Pagans.</P>
<P>How did the Kings and Magi&s;trates of <HI>A&s;&s;yria, Egypt, Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> endeavour to cultivate letters and theology in their re&s;pective kingdoms and &s;tates! <HI>Belus</HI> the &s;econd King of <HI>Babylon, Thyoth</HI> the &s;econd King of <HI>Memphis,</HI> in <HI>Egypt, Jupiter</HI> King of <HI>Crete, Solon</HI> King of <HI>Athens, Numa Pompilius</HI> the &s;econd King of <HI>Rome,</HI> were not only famous for their own learning and philo&s;ophy, they were al&s;o eminent for the en|couragement of literature among their &s;ubjects. And they were equally zealous to e&s;tabli&s;h and cultivate religion, and the public wor&s;hip of the DEITY among their people.</P>
<P><HI>Thyoth,</HI> and <HI>Solon,</HI> and <HI>Numa,</HI> were &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the advanta|ges the civil &s;tate derived from religion, that they formed laws for the regulation of religious public &s;ervices&mdash;appointed an order of men, who &s;hould devote them&s;elves entirely to the &s;tudy of theology, and the performance of the public rights and &s;ervices of it; and, to give the greater authority to their religious in&s;titutions among their people, they pretended to have received them from the Gods. <HI>Numa</HI> in particular, pre|tended that the godde&s;s <HI>Egeria</HI> nightly communicated to him the &s;everal parts of that religious economy which he e&s;tabli&s;hed among the <HI>Romans.</HI> And all hi&s;tory a&s;&s;ures us, that religion, mutilated and corrupted as it was, greatly promoted the peace and pro&s;perity of tho&s;e nations where it was thus e&s;tabli&s;hed. It &s;truck the minds of the people with reverence and awe; gave them a veneration for their Kings and Prie&s;ts&mdash;and per&s;uaded them to cultivate the arts of peace and order among them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>IT is well known that the veneration which Kings and Ma|gi&s;trates have generally &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wn religion and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, hath been improved as an objection again&s;t <HI>revealed religion,</HI> as be|ing a <HI>&s;tate engine</HI> or <HI>mere prie&s;tcraft.</HI></P>
<P>IF by religion's being a piece of <HI>prie&s;tcraft,</HI> be meant, that religion was <HI>invented</HI> by prie&s;ts, the pretence is fal&s;e, and con|trary to the hi&s;tory of religion in all nations; &s;ince that hi&s;to|ry informs us, that there were no prie&s;ts in any nation, till a
<PB N="9" REF="022505_0008_0FB94771EEAD2090">
national religion became e&s;tabli&s;hed, and generally received. If our modern freethinkers mean, that religion was the <HI>inven|tion</HI> of <HI>&s;tate&s;men</HI> and <HI>politicians,</HI> when they call it a <HI>&s;tate engine,</HI> this pretence is as far from truth and fact, as the other, and as contrary to hi&s;tory. The mo&s;t rational and probable conject|ure, and that which is be&s;t countenanced by the authentic hi&s;tory of religion in all nations, is, that GOD him&s;elf in&s;truct|ed <HI>Adam,</HI> and the <HI>Antediluvians,</HI> in the principles of that reli|gion which he required of them, and &s;howed them the manner of performing all its rites and ceremonies. <HI>Noah</HI> came forth of the ark with the religion of the old world, which his chil|dren learned of him. And the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> retain to this day the principles of that religion which their great prophet <HI>Fobi,</HI> or <HI>Noah,</HI> taught them. And that part of <HI>Noah</HI>'s family which travelled we&s;tward, and, by their de&s;cendants, &s;ettled <HI>Nineveh, Babylon, Greece, Rome,</HI> &amp;c. retained for many ages the religion of their progenitor. At length, however, this ancient religion was corrupted, but never entirely lo&s;t among the nations. And therefore religion never was <HI>invented,</HI> though it was greatly <HI>corrupted</HI> both by prie&s;ts and politicians.</P>
<P>IF the meaning be, that Kings and Princes, State&s;men and Politicians, have univer&s;ally, in all ages and nations, con&s;ider|ed religion as &s;ignally beneficial to the civil &s;tate; this indeed is very true; and they have ever thought very ju&s;tly of reli|gion when they have thus con&s;idered it. But by what man|agement does it become an objection again&s;t religion, that it greatly promotes the intere&s;ts of communities! We have too much rea&s;on to believe that &s;uch objections again&s;t religion originate in the &s;ame manner, that objections again&s;t rea&s;on do in &s;ome men, according to the &s;aying of Lord <HI>Bolingbroke,</HI> "That when rea&s;on is again&s;t a man, then a man will be again&s;t rea&s;on." Rea&s;on is again&s;t a man who is re&s;olved to think and act unrea&s;onably. So is religion again&s;t men who are in|di&s;po&s;ed to comply with its precepts: and hence the objection again&s;t it.</P>
<P N="2">II. RELIGION, if it be kindly entertained, is of &s;pecial &s;er|vice to the people, in their political capacity, as well as to Magi&s;trates.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="10" REF="022505_0009_0FB9477362E92240">1. RELIGION injoins upon the people obedience to legal government, and conformity to wi&s;e and good laws: and this it does in a very humane and generous way, by teaching men the de&s;ign of civil polity and government, its great utility, and even nece&s;&s;ity, in the world; and that a wi&s;e and good government is the ordinance of GOD, and on <HI>that</HI> account ought to be very re&s;pectable among men. Religion informs of the great guilt they contract, who re&s;i&s;t a well regulated government; and the imminent danger they expo&s;e them|&s;elves to; that, "Who&s;oever re&s;i&s;teth authority, re&s;i&s;teth the ordinance of GOD;" and that "they who re&s;i&s;t, &s;hall receive to them&s;elves damnation."&mdash;Thus is religion very friendly to the civil &s;tate, as it teaches due &s;ubjection and obedience to wi&s;e and good laws and government.</P>
<P N="2">2. RELIGION tends to make men quiet and peaceable to|wards each other; as it is de&s;igned and adapted to eradicate tho&s;e corrupt pa&s;&s;ions and di&s;po&s;itions of mankind, which are unfriendly to the peace and tranquility of the State.&mdash;Anger, envy, revenge, a &s;editious and divi&s;ive &s;pirit, a peevi&s;h, fretful, di&s;contented temper, all which vices, as they are mo&s;t unfavor|able to the welfare and pro&s;perity of the public, are di&s;count|enanced and forbidden in our holy religion. All deceit in contract, fraud, inju&s;tice, extortion and rapine, are very ex|pre&s;sly prohibited both in the laws of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Bribery, corruption and venality, a &s;our, unfriendly, uncharitable, malignant temper and di&s;po&s;ition&mdash;evil&s;peaking and &s;lander, than which no vices are more prejudicial to the order and harmony of human &s;ociety, and, together with the&s;e, the whole black catalogue of un&s;ocial pa&s;&s;ions and vices, are corrected and condemned in the laws of the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> con&s;titu|tion, and in the religion of our <HI>divine Redeemer.</HI></P>
<P>"THOU &s;halt not rai&s;e a fal&s;e report; put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witne&s;s. Thou &s;halt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither &s;halt thou &s;peak in a cau&s;e, to decline after many, to wre&s;t judgment. Neither &s;halt thou countenance a poor man in his cau&s;e. If thou meet thine enemy's ox, or his a&s;s going a&s;tray, thou &s;halt &s;ure|ly bring it back to him again, If thou &s;ee the a&s;s of him
<PB N="11" REF="022505_0010_0FB94774DF0ADA88">
that hateth thee lying under his burden, and woulde&s;t forbear to help him; thou &s;halt &s;urely help with him. Thou &s;halt not wre&s;t the judgment of the poor in his cau&s;e. Keep thee far from a fal&s;e matter; and the innocent and righteous &s;lay thou not: for I will not ju&s;tify the wicked." <HI>Exod.</HI> XXIII.1&mdash;7.</P>
<P N="3">3. IT is one great de&s;ign, both of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> religion, to implant in human nature all tho&s;e &s;entiments, pa&s;|&s;ions and affections, which are mo&s;t friendly to &s;ociety; and to engage all the members of the politic body in &s;uch prac|tices as naturally tend to &s;ocial felicity. Strict ju&s;tice and righteou&s;ne&s;s, both in &s;entiment and practice, in all contracts and dealings one with another, is a great command of religion.&mdash;"Ye &s;hall do no unrighteou&s;ne&s;s in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in mea&s;ure. Ju&s;t balances, ju&s;t weights, a ju&s;t ephah, and a ju&s;t hin, &s;hall ye have: I am JEHOVAH your GOD, who brought you out of the land of <HI>Egypt.</HI>"</P>
<P>AND how much do ju&s;tice and righteou&s;ne&s;s tend to advance the honor and welfare of a nation!&mdash;Truth and fidelity, uni|ver&s;al benevolence, love and charity, a peaceable, quiet, placa|ble temper, and a &s;incere de&s;ire to promote the plea&s;ure and happine&s;s of our neighbour; are all of them great maxims of <HI>revealed religion</HI>; and are every where inculcated by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> by our <HI>Saviour,</HI> and by his <HI>Apo&s;tles.</HI></P>
<P>"AND if thou &s;elle&s;t ought unto thy neighbour, or buye&s;t ought of thy neighbour's hand, ye &s;hall not oppre&s;s one an|other. And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee; thou &s;halt relieve him: yea, though he be a &s;tran|ger, or a &s;ojourner; that he may live with thee."</P>
<P>BUT as it happened to the religion of <HI>Noah,</HI> that, in a pro|ce&s;s of ages, it was corrupted and ravi&s;hed of mo&s;t of its ori|ginal purity and &s;implicity among the nations; &s;o likewi&s;e that of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;hared the &s;ame fate, in the latter ages of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> &s;tate, by the mi&s;taken glo&s;&s;es and interpretations of the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees.</HI> And, as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was rai&s;ed up to retrieve the character of, and add perfection to, the ancient religion of <HI>Noah</HI>; &s;o JESUS of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> the great prophet like unto <HI>Mo|&s;es,</HI> made it a principal part of his bu&s;ine&s;s on earth, to re&s;tore the honor of tho&s;e divine laws given to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> and to
<PB N="12" REF="022505_0011_0FB94776CC202040">
pre&s;ent them to mankind dre&s;&s;ed in their native purity and &s;implicity, with the mo&s;t &s;piritual and &s;ublime annotations upon them.</P>
<P>HENCE we find him repeating this expre&s;&s;ion, "Ye have heard that it hath been &s;aid by them of old time:" referring to the fal&s;e comments of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> doctors upon the con&s;ti|tution of <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>FOR a &s;pecimen of our SAVIOUR's method of teaching di|vinity out of the laws of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> permit me to recite a part of one of his lectures.</P>
<P>"YE have heard that it hath been &s;aid by them of old time, thou &s;halt not kill: and who&s;oever &s;hall kill, &s;hall be in dan|ger of the judgment." It &s;eems, by what follows, that the <HI>Hebrew</HI> doctors extended the prohibition no farther than the outward act of murder, not comprehending therein the inward temper and di&s;po&s;ition of the heart: and therefore our SAV|IOUR adds his own comment. "But I &s;ay unto you, that who&s;oever is <HI>angry</HI> with his brother without a cau&s;e, &s;hall be in danger of the judgment; and who&s;oever &s;hall &s;ay to his brother, <HI>Raca,</HI>" i.e. you beggarly fellow; "&s;hall be in dan|ger of the council; but who&s;oever &s;hall &s;ay, <HI>thou fool,</HI> &s;hall be in danger of hellfire."</P>
<P>And in&s;tead of <HI>hating</HI> an <HI>enemy,</HI> which the <HI>Scribes</HI> admitted, our SAVIOUR commands, "to <HI>love</HI> our enemies, <HI>ble&s;s</HI> them that <HI>cur&s;e</HI> us, do <HI>good</HI> to them that <HI>hate</HI> us, and to <HI>pray</HI> for them who <HI>de&s;pitefully</HI> u&s;e, and <HI>per&s;ecute</HI> us."</P>
<P>No wonder the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> &s;tate declined, when they had cor|rupted the laws of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> however happy it might have been, if that nation had regarded them in their true intention.</P>
<P>IF men &s;hould deal ju&s;tly and uprightly one with another, if truth and fidelity &s;hould influence all their mutual inter|cour&s;e, if all &s;hould wi&s;h well to all, and, according to their re|&s;pective capacities and places, &s;hould endeavour to promote the univer&s;al good&mdash;if mankind &s;hould generally be compa&s;|&s;ionate and merciful, both to the &s;ouls and bodies of their fel|low men, if they &s;hould refrain from all malevolent and evil &s;peaking&mdash;be very delicate and tender in their treatment of per&s;ons and characters&mdash;if they &s;hould heartily love their
<PB N="13" REF="022505_0012_0FB94777DEDEF440">
country, and be willing, not only to &s;acrifice their private re&s;entments, but their per&s;onal intere&s;ts al&s;o, to promote the public weal and pro&s;perity; how happy would human &s;ocie|ty be, and how near a re&s;emblance would it form to that bright world of harmony and friend&s;hip that is above!</P>
<P N="3">III. IF we reflect on the wi&s;e, holy and ju&s;t providence of GOD, we &s;hall &s;ee rea&s;on to con&s;ider religion as mo&s;t friendly to the happine&s;s of &s;ocial life.</P>
<P>FROM the partial and unequal di&s;tributions of divine pro|vidence towards individuals, whether virtuous or vicious, in this world, it hath been very ju&s;tly inferred, that the righ|teous governor of the univer&s;e de&s;igns &s;ome future time and place, when and where he will rectify all the partial admini&s;tra|tions of his providence, and adequately reward the virtues, and puni&s;h the vices of individuals, and cau&s;e the rectoral honor and dignity of his moral government of mankind to appear, and be acknowledged by the a&s;&s;embled univer&s;e.</P>
<P>ON this &s;uppo&s;ition, it is no objection again&s;t the rectitude of the moral government of the world, that virtue, in individ|uals, &s;hould &s;igh and mourn, be afflicted, and obliged to en|counter the numberle&s;s ills of human life; whil&s;t vice is gay and &s;portive, free from pain, and regaling it&s;elf in all the plea|&s;ures of &s;en&s;e.&mdash;The pro&s;pect of that other world, where virtue will triumph, and where vice, in its turn, will be doom|ed to weeping and woe, and to endure the evils it hath incur|red here, clears up the &s;cene, and vindicates the honor and ju&s;tice of divine admini&s;tration. But with civil &s;ociety, with kingdoms and &s;tates, it is far otherwise; and a different method of rea&s;oning mu&s;t be adopted. The future &s;tate, which religion reveals, knows no man in a <HI>political,</HI> or <HI>national</HI> capacity; and therefore will not either reward, or puni&s;h mankind in the <HI>&s;ocial,</HI> but in the <HI>individual</HI> and <HI>per&s;onal</HI> charac|ter <HI>only.</HI> Hence it is ju&s;t and rea&s;onable to inter <HI>a priori,</HI> that it hath been, and ever will be, the invariable <HI>maxim</HI> of the &s;upreme moral government, to treat all nations, and political &s;ocieties, according to their public character, being virtuous or vicious. And, if we revolve the hi&s;tory of mankind, we &s;hall &s;urely find, that virtuous nations have ever been pro&s;perous
<PB N="14" REF="022505_0013_0FB94779649CAA58">
and happy, &s;o long as they retained their virtue; and that vicious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, at one time or another, have been &s;ignally puni&s;hed, in the providence of almighty GOD.</P>
<P>WHEN the prophets foretold the fall and ruin of the <HI>A&s;&s;yri|an, Per&s;ian, Egyptian, Greecian</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> empires, they inva|riably alledged their national corruptions and vices, as the cau&s;e of their national de&s;truction.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Babylon</HI> was to be &s;ubverted, the prophet &s;ays, "A grievous vi&s;ion is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherou&s;ly, and the &s;poiler &s;poileth.

<P><HI>Tyre</HI> was de&s;troyed for her pride, pre&s;umption and luxury, "Who hath taken this coun&s;el again&s;t <HI>Tyre,</HI> the crowning ci|ty, who&s;e merchants are princes, who&s;e traffickers are the hon|orable of the earth? The Lord of Ho&s;ts hath purpo&s;ed it, to &s;tain the pride of all glory, and to bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth."</P>
<P><HI>Egypt,</HI> and the <HI>Greek</HI> empire fell by their vices, as we are abundantly informed, both by &s;acred and profane hi&s;tory.&mdash;<HI>Rome</HI> flouri&s;hed long, a renowned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eat both of arts and arms, a glorious empire, mi&s;tre&s;s and arbitre&s;s of three fourths of the globe.

<P><PB N="15" REF="022505_0014_0FB9477AE2AAC568"><HI>Mo&s;es</HI> told the <HI>Hebrews</HI> that, if they would adhere to tho&s;e moral laws and &s;tatures, which he had been divinely authoriz|ed to enact for them, it &s;hould be their life; and &s;hould pro|long their national pro&s;perity and happine&s;s in the land of <HI>Canaan.</HI> And herein that great and good man acted, not as a wi&s;e and able &s;tate&s;man <HI>only,</HI> but as a mo&s;t affectionate patriot, and lover of his nation: pre&s;enting <HI>I&s;rael</HI> with a glorious &s;cene of national dignity and importance, tranquility and hap|pine&s;s, and a golden age perpetuated, upon the pre&s;umption of their future virtue and obedience; and a dreadful rever&s;e of fortune, in ca&s;e of vice and di&s;obedience. "And it &s;hall come to pa&s;s," &s;aith he, "if thou &s;halt hearken diligently un|to the voice of the LORD thy GOD, to ob|&s;erve and to do all his commandments, which O command thee this day, that the LORD thy GOD will &s;et thee on high above all nations of the earth. And all the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings &s;hall come on thee, and over|take thee, if thou &s;halt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy GOD.

And the LORD &s;hall make thee plenteous in goods, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy ground, in the land which the LORD &s;ware to thy fathers to give thee."</P>
<P>BUT if the <HI>Hebrews</HI> rebelled again&s;t JEHOVAH, and became corrupt and vicious in their national character and manners, how awfully &s;hould their fortune be rever&s;ed! "If thou wilt not ob&s;erve to do all the words of this law, that are writ|ten in this book, that thou maye&s;t fear this glorious name, JEHOVAH thy GOD. Then the LORD will make thy plagues

Deut. XXVIII.</P>
<P>AND the hi&s;tory of the <HI>Hebrews</HI> informs, that the&s;e promi&s;|es and threatenings of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> were perpetually verified in the &s;tate and circum&s;tances of that nation.</P>
<P>WHILST <HI>I&s;rael</HI> were virtuous, and attended to the laws of JEHOVAH, they were pro&s;perous and happy, and a very re|&s;pectable nation; when they degenerated, and became corrupt and vicious, and di&s;regarded the commandments of JEHOVAH, they were di&s;a&s;trous and wretched, a &s;corn and deri&s;ion among the nations which dwelt around them, and a &s;orry prey to their enemies.</P>
<P>INDEED the divine admini&s;trations towards the <HI>Hebrews</HI> ev|er derived their complexion from the moral character and conduct of that nation: and, although their &s;ituation was &s;omewhat different from that of other nations, being made a <HI>theocracy,</HI> and placed under the more immediate in&s;pection of JEHOVAH, as their <HI>civil,</HI> as well as <HI>moral King</HI> and <HI>Governor</HI>; yet all <HI>other nations,</HI> as well as the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> were under the <HI>moral government</HI> of JEHOVAH; were his creatures, endued with rea&s;on, and indulged with many natural, civil and reli|gious privileges, sufficient for all the purpo&s;es of virtue, and of moral in&s;titution and discipline; though much inferior to tho&s;e which the <HI>Hebrews</HI> enjoyed. Hence the rea&s;on why all the nations of the earth have ever been, and ever will be, ac|countable to GOD, as a <HI>moral governor,</HI> in their <HI>national capa|city.</HI>&mdash;And as GOD hath ever treated all the nations of the

earth, in every age, according to their national character and conduct, and either ble&s;&s;ed, or frowned upon them, as they have been generally virtuous or vicious; &s;o have we the high|e&s;t rea&s;on to believe he will invariably treat mankind in all &s;ucceeding ages and nations, in the &s;ame manner, and by the &s;ame rule. It is a catholic and perpetual maxim of revelation, verified by the experience of all ages and nations, that "righ|teou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a nation;" and that, "&s;in is the reproach of any people."</P>
<P>RELIGION, in its own nature and tendency, is admirably calculated to render a nation re&s;pectable and illu&s;trious abroad, as well as pro&s;perous and happy at home: whil&s;t &s;in, vice, immorality and di&s;&s;olutene&s;s of manners, as naturally tend to fix a public indelible &s;tigma and reproach upon a nation, and to fill it with factions and divi&s;ions, render its internal circum|&s;tances wretched and mi&s;erable, and bring it to an untimely death: for nations, politic bodies, &s;icken, langui&s;h, and die, as well as natural bodies; and virtue is the health, and cau&s;es the longevity of nations; whil&s;t vice is their di&s;ea&s;e, and a &s;ad, though certain, pre&s;age of a premature political death.</P>
<P>WE have al&s;o &s;een that the providence of GOD, the &s;upreme monarch of the univer&s;e, favors virtuous, whil&s;t it invariably frowns upon vicious, nations.</P>
<P>FROM the nature and tendency of religion therefore, and the ju&s;t and holy providence of GOD, we may with great truth and &s;afety conclude, that all political communities will be hap|py or mi&s;erable, as they &s;hall be virtuous or vicious.</P>
<P>I SHALL comprehend the improvement of the preceding di&s;cour&s;e in a few addre&s;&s;es, which are cu&s;tomary, and there|fore decent and re&s;pectful, on &s;uch occa&s;ions as the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE Chief Magi&s;trate in this commonwealth claims my fir&s;t attention.</P>
<P>MAY it plea&s;e your Excellency to indulge me a few min|utes, whil&s;t I make an inference or two, which may &s;pecial|ly refer to the office and duty of gentlemen who fill the chief places of power and tru&s;t in the civil State.</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT it is the peculiar and inde&s;pen&s;able duty of civil Magi&s;trates, to be per&s;onally virtuous, is an inference, which,
<PB N="18" REF="022505_0017_0FB94786CA55B0E0">
I doubt that your Excellency hath already anticipated.&mdash;A wi&s;e magi&s;trate would be virtuous, not only to e&s;tabli&s;h and adorn his own character, and to obtain the approbation of HIM, who is infinitely greater and more illu&s;truous than all the Kings and Potentates of the earth; but from a rational and well regulated affection to his country. A patriotic &s;pirit will excite and animate him to a virtuous and religious life.&mdash;A vicious and di&s;&s;olute Magi&s;trate is a mis&s;hapen mon&s;trous character! He neither loves him&s;elf, his country, nor his GOD! He certainly can be no true patriot, let his profe&s;&s;ions be what they may: Religion the glory and &s;afety of the State&mdash;an irreligious profane Magi&s;trate con&s;ulting and de|&s;igning the welfare of the State! how contradictious and ab&s;urd an idea!&mdash;Virtue in high life hath a commanding and &s;overeign influence. The examples of the great may do much to cheri&s;h and promote religion; or, they may have a mo&s;t pernicious tendency, if vicious, to patronize and &s;pread the contagion of vice and evil manners: a Magi&s;trate, therefore, &s;hould make it his great ambition that his own character be fair and good, and that he pre&s;ent a noble and enticing pattern of virtue and religion before all the people.</P>
<P N="2">2. A WISE and good Magi&s;trate will improve all the influ|ence his &s;tation and authority give him, to promote virtue and religion among the people.</P>
<P>IF religion be the life and glory of a nation, and the mo&s;t important art of prolonging the dignity and happine&s;s of civil &s;ociety; a wi&s;e and virtuous Magi&s;trate will mo&s;t ardently wi&s;h to be an in&s;trument of the promotion of religion among his people; and will u&s;e his utmo&s;t prudent endeavors to ad|vance its reputation, render it fa&s;hionable, and cau&s;e it to be cheri&s;hed and cultivated.</P>
<P>SUCH a Magi&s;trate will be concerned to procure for the DEITY, for his holy words, his &s;abbaths, ordinances and wor|&s;hip, the &s;olemn attention, the profound re&s;pect and venera|tion, which are indi&s;putably their due. He will wi&s;ely im|prove his influence that a &s;pirit of justice, fidelity, peace and charity in&s;pire all ranks and orders of men: and, in his exalt|ed place, he will maintain a con&s;tant regard to the&s;e worthy

de&s;igns, in all the bu&s;ine&s;s of legi&s;lation, and execution of the laws in the State: indeed the honor, tranquility and happi|ne&s;s of the community, in the con&s;tant practice of virtue and religion, and entire &s;ecurity in the enjoyment of their per&s;ons and properties, will co&s;titute the noble de&s;ign of the political life of a wi&s;e and good Magi&s;trate.</P>
<P>YOUR Excellency's known character, and the general &s;uffrag|es of your brethren, by which you have been many years con|tinued in the chair of &s;tate, warrant my belief, that your duty to GOD and this people hath long warmed and animated your heart; and, that what is &s;ugge&s;ted concerning the obligations of a Magi&s;trate, will be kindly accepted by you, Sir, though the&s;e things may be far better conceived in your own mind, than I am able to expre&s;s them.</P>
<P>BE plea&s;ed, Sir, to have patience with me a little farther, whil&s;t I include your Excellency in an addre&s;s to the honor|able General A&s;&s;embly convened in this hou&s;e, at who&s;e reque&s;t I perform this part this day.</P>
<P>MAY it plea&s;e his <HI>honor</HI> the Lieutenant governor, the honor|able Coun&s;ellors, and the venerable Repre&s;entatives of the State, in General A&s;&s;embly convened, to indulge me a little; whil&s;t I, within the limits of my own province, &s;ugge&s;t a few things, which may claim your attention, as the Legi&s;lature of a great and growing people, whom you mo&s;t certainly wi&s;h to make re&s;pectable and happy.</P>
<P N="1">I. THE honor and wor&s;hip of the DEITY are &s;urely objects of &s;uch magnitude and importance, as may well demand your fir&s;t attention.</P>
<P>No nation under heaven ever was politically happy, or pro&s;pered long, without &s;ome practical reverence of GOD, and attention to his wor&s;hip. The great JEHOVAH hath declar|ed, "By me Kings reign, and Princes decree ju&s;tice. By me Princes rule, and Nobles, even all Judges of the earth." How then can a Legi&s;lature of <HI>Thei&s;ts,</HI> much le&s;s a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Legi&s;lature, di&s;charge, either their duty to GOD, or the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them by the community, whil&s;t they neglect to adore and wor&s;hip GOD them&s;elves, or to improve their influ|ence that he be adored and wor&s;hipped by the people!&mdash;An

oath for confirmation, and the termination of controver&s;y, is a &s;olemn appeal to GOD: if all reverence of GOD, and &s;acred regard to religion, were extingui&s;hed, the &s;olemnity of an oath is ab&s;olutely gone, and, with its &s;olemnity, its binding force and obligation are at once taken away; and nothing then remains to i&s;&s;ue, even civil cau&s;es, but the &s;word! and we may depend, that the &s;word will not be &s;ufficient for this pur|po&s;e long, after all religion is gone.

<P>MAY I not, venerable Senators, addre&s;s you as <HI>St. Paul</HI> did King <HI>Agrippa,</HI> with the nece&s;&s;ary variation? <HI>Believe ye this report of religion, and of your duty concerning it? I know that ye believe.</HI></P>

unfriendly and un&s;ociable &s;entiment, pa&s;&s;ion, and affection; and to implant and cheri&s;h every generous and noble &s;entiment, and every kindly &s;ocial grace and virtue:&mdash;a religion evident|ly compo&s;ing a principal part of <HI>Jehovah</HI>'s va&s;t and &s;tupend|ous &s;ystem of moral government, which he originally de&s;igned, and hath ever conducted, for the perfection and happine&s;s of man, as a rational and &s;ocial being.</P>
<P>You al&s;o enjoy the &s;ublime ple&s;ure of the reflection that, whil&s;t you endeavor &s;tudiou&s;ly to inve&s;tigate, and faithfully to teach, the doctrines and precepts of <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion,</HI> you co|operate with the &s;acred <HI>Trinity,</HI> in conducting the divine de&s;ign of infinite love and grace to man!</P>
<P>FROM &s;uch reflections you may derive divine encourage|ment to fidelity, and &s;ufficient &s;upport under all the evils and temptations incident to <HI>man,</HI> or peculiar to the <HI>clergyman.</HI></P>
<P>IF the patience of this great and very re&s;pectable auditory be not quite gone, I would addre&s;s my&s;elf in the la&s;t place to this whole a&s;&s;embly pre&s;ent.&mdash;My brethren and friends, the &s;ubject which we have had under con&s;ideration pre&s;ents indi|viduals in the civil State with many important motives and arguments to per&s;uade to the practice of virtue and religion.</P>
<P N="1">I. THAT love of his country, which every one ought to cheri&s;h, may be improved as a powerful motive to religion. Individuals are the con&s;tituent parts of communities and na|tions: the real character of individuals, therefore, will give complexion to the character of the nation, of which they are parts. A virtuous nation, compo&s;ed of vicious individuals, is an inadmi&s;&s;ible &s;oleci&s;m in ethics. If we wi&s;h our dear native country happy, we mu&s;t wi&s;ely re&s;olve to become per&s;onally virtuous. Virtue is nece&s;&s;ary to the pro&s;perity of our coun|try and nation&mdash;national virtue is compo&s;ed of that which the individuals of any nation practice: love to our country there|fore involves in it a due re&s;pect to virtue: hence one who indulges him&s;elf in the practice of vice, cannot, with truth and propriety, be called a lover of his country; becau&s;e he manife&s;ts a di&s;regard to that which all hi&s;tory, both &s;acred and profane, demon&s;trates to be nece&s;&s;ary to its happine&s;s.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="24" REF="022505_0023_0FB947909CDC13A8">2. AFFECTION to our deare&s;t earthly connections and re|latives, furni&s;hes us with another very engaging and tender motive to religion.</P>
<P>OUR wives, our children, and other dear connections and friends, who&s;e happine&s;s is involved in that of their country, call loudly upon us, though with the mo&s;t alluring &s;oftne&s;s and delicacy, to put in practice religion, which may in&s;ure the pro&s;perity and happine&s;s of our common country.</P>
<P>How can we have the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to a&s;&s;ume the character of <HI>hu|mane</HI> and <HI>generous,</HI> and yet be deaf to the voice of &s;uch wi&s;e and &s;en&s;ible charmers!</P>
<P>WE may al&s;o con&s;ider, that, probably, many of our deare&s;t connections, if not in them&s;elves, yet in their de&s;cendants, mu&s;t abide the fate of their country for ages yet to come: we hope to be perpetuated in our po&s;terity to the late&s;t age&mdash;do we not wi&s;h to leave our country to tho&s;e dear parts of our|&s;elves, who may &s;urvive us, under the protection of Heaven, encircled by the kinde&s;t paternal providence, and con&s;equent|ly in peace and pro&s;perity!</P>
<P><HI>Mo&s;es</HI> evidently did not confine his views to that generation which <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> introduced into <HI>Canaan,</HI> when he recommended religion to the <HI>Hebrews</HI>&mdash;"And through this thing ye &s;hall prolong your days in the land whither ye go over <HI>Jordan</HI> to po&s;&s;e&s;s it."&mdash;If <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> hath any re&s;pect to the longevity of the men of that generation, yet, no doubt, he hath a principal re|gard to the pro&s;perity and happine&s;s of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive generations in that promi&s;ed land&mdash;and he plainly informs them, that their obedience to GOD would prolong their political life: i.e. they &s;hould continue a nation, and a happy nation too, &s;o long as they &s;hould maintain their integrity, and continue obedient to the commandments of JEHOVAH.</P>
<P>How can we endure the thought of rendering the &s;ituation of our families, and of tho&s;e beings who have derived a mo|mentary exi&s;tence from us, wretched and mi&s;erable, by con|duct, which, at once, proclaims us bere&s;t of natural affection, and of gratitude to GOD!&mdash;And how will the reflection &s;et upon our minds when we come to die, that we have entailed the cur&s;e of Heaven upon our country, and con&s;equently up|on
<PB N="25" REF="022505_0024_0FB9479220FE4A00">
tho&s;e who may perpetuate our name for long ages yet to come! that, by our vices, we have provoked the GOD of our fathers, and &s;old our country and our po&s;terity to foreign ty|rants, who may burn and lay wa&s;te this goodly land, carry our children captives, or chain them here to va&s;&s;alage and &s;lavery, far more cruel than death!&mdash;My friends, I fear we do not con&s;ider what we are about, and what infinite and unutterable mi&s;eries we are involving our country and our children in, whil&s;t we are indulging our&s;elves in vice!</P>
<P N="3">3, ONCE more&mdash;A proper regard to our own happine&s;s, which is mo&s;t intimately connected with that of our country, ought to influence us to the love and practice of religion.</P>
<P>WHO would choo&s;e to live in a country, in which tyranny and de&s;poti&s;m on the one hand, or anarchy and confu&s;ion on the other, had either en&s;laved the people, or involved them in civil di&s;cords and di&s;&s;entions, too intollerable either to be borne, or ea&s;ily removed!&mdash;Yet irreligion and profanene&s;s tend directly to the introduction of the&s;e, or greater evils; for, as that man is unfit to govern others, who cannot govern him&s;elf&mdash;&s;o that nation which is en&s;laved to vice, is ju&s;t pre|pared to be made a &s;lave to foreign power.</P>
<P>MAY the objects which are deare&s;t to us on earth&mdash;may natural and parental affection&mdash;may the tender and delicate ties of friend&s;hip&mdash;may love to that country in which we fir&s;t drew our vital breath, and in which we yet live&mdash;may a prop|er re&s;pect to our own peace and pleasure whil&s;t we live, and e&s;pecially a regard to that tranquility of mind and manly a&s;|&s;urance, which may encourage and &s;upport us in a dying hour&mdash;may any, may all the&s;e motives con&s;piring, excite us to a timely and &s;erious attention to the things of our political peace, and per&s;uade us to live in the practice of tho&s;e graces and virtues which are the honor and protection of a nation; and al&s;o to improve all the power and influence of our re&s;pect|ive &s;tations and capacities, to recommend religion to our families, our neighbours, and our country; that it may uni|ver&s;ally prevail, and become as a munition of rocks, and an impregnable bulwark to our nation.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="022505_0025_0FB94794090C44D8">
Now unto the Supreme Monarch of the univer&s;e, "the King eternal, immortal, invi&s;ible, the only wi&s;e GOD," be all honor, dominion and power, henceforth and forevermore.</P>
