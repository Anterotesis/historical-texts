This was a very heavy Stroke upon this Country, and brought them low; partly by the lo&s;s of their Ve&s;&s;els, and partly by the great lo&s;s of their Men; &s;ome whole Ve&s;&s;els Companies were lo&s;t, and &s;ome whole Companies of the Militia, never heard of. And tho&s;e that did come home, brought a dread|ful Sickne&s;s with them; &s;o that abundance died after the Fleets Arrival at home; And upon this the Coun|try was greatly brought in Debt. This, we mu&s;t all acknowledge, was a &s;ad and lamentable Condition we were brought into; and how to di&s;charge the heavy Debt, lying on the Province; was a bu&s;ine&s;s lay much at heart, with tho&s;e that had the Government upon them at that day, the debates then had about it I am not now able to give you; but the re&s;ult they then came to, was to I&s;&s;ue out a number of Colony Bills to di&s;charge the Debts then fallen upon them, by the Expedition.</P>

<P>Before this; viz. <HI>December</HI> 10th. 1689. the Council and Repre&s;entatives Appointed Mr. <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">kim Hutchin&s;on,</HI> Mr. <HI>Peter Sergeant,</HI> Mr. <HI>Sam&s;on Sheaf,</HI> Mr. <HI>John Eyre,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Thomas Brattle,</HI> to grant Debentures for Souldiers Wages; who faithfully and indu&s;triou&s;ly attended that Service.</P>
<P>Some Approved this Emi&s;&s;ion as a good thing; others &s;aid, They and their Children would Rue the day that ever they were Invented. However &s;o it was, the Bills were made, the Sailors and Souldiers were paid off with them. Now for the con&s;equences;</P>
<P>It put the Country into Confu&s;ion as to their Trade. The Bills then made, did in &s;ome mea&s;ure an&s;wer the End, becau&s;e they did di&s;charge the Debt; but with what a great lo&s;s, was it to tho&s;e Poor-Men, who ven|tured their Lives in the Expedition? They were forced to buy &s;uch Goods as its likely they had hardly any need of, to get rid of their New-Coyn'd Money. And what they bought, was &s;o to their di&s;advantage, that
<PB N="7" REF="002291_0008_0fdb1bc68c681df0">
they put off their Bills, at <HI>Twelve</HI> or <HI>Thiteen Shillings</HI> in the <HI>Pound</HI>; &s;o that indeed they had in effect, one third part of their pay &s;truck off; a thing too m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> at the Bottom of all the afore&s;aid Stocks. The Ju&s;tice of the proceedings. I &s;hall leave to the Reader.</P>
<P>The other Con&s;equence was, that it was the fir&s;t &s;tep, or leading &s;troke, to all the Bills of Credit, that have been put out in this Province, and not only this Province, but the &s;everal Colonies, and Plantations, round about us; And if I am not mi&s;informed, One of the principal I&s;lands in the We&s;t Indies, took their mea&s;ures, of making Bills of Credit, from a Gentleman brought up in <HI>New-England</HI>; who advi&s;ed them of the great benefit, they were to this Country. But he thought only of the beginning, and not of the End; when he gave them that Advice.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>The Progre&s;s made therein by the General Count, and the &s;everal heads they have been brought out upon.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Progre&s;s made in the Quantity of Pro|vince Bills; it hath been &s;omething large, I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s; but as to the growing, or thriving of the Pro|vince thereby, I cannot as yet &s;ee through it. After the making the fir&s;t Bills for the Canada Expedition, it being found, an ea&s;y way of paying of Debts, &s;everal more Expeditions were contrived, the Number, and Form, of them, is needle&s;s here to in&s;ert; but we had found a way to pay for them, by &s;till I&s;&s;uing out a farther Number of Paper Bills; So that whether they &s;ucceeded or not, we had found an ea&s;y way of pay|ing for them, and &s;huffling the Saddle off our own books, on to our Children; when the Debt was to be paid, it was but rai&s;ing &s;o many Thou&s;and Pounds to be paid in &s;uch Years to come, and the matter was over, the Tax lay no heavier on the Subject, than be|fore: But by the way, I would have it con&s;idered, that part of tho&s;e Taxes are yet to be rai&s;ed on the Co|ming Generation. In the Year 1711. the &s;econd Ex|pedition
<PB N="8" REF="002291_0009_0fdb1bc86f615d30" MS="y">
o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Canada</HI> was formed, and all things &s;eemed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> on that Affair, the General Court of this Pro|vince &s;aw good to Advance <HI>Forty Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> for the &s;upply of the Fleet, for that Expedition, and to take their pay in Bills on the Government, in <HI>Great Britain.</HI> This was a con&s;iderable Addition to what Bills were out before, and all on a Fund for Years to come. All this while the Silver and Gold, that the Country had gotten by their good Husbandry before now, flew away, fa&s;ter than ever it came to us; and by rea&s;on of the Scarcity of Silver and Gold, for a <HI>Medium,</HI> the Government were per&s;waded &s;till to go on in the old Road, of I&s;&s;uing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of Paper Bills. The &s;everal Bills Emitted until this time were upon Impo&s;t and Exci&s;e, and a Tax upon Polls and E&s;tates within this Province, which war a good Fund, &s;o far, as it could conveni|ently run. Then it being thought improper to &s;train that matter too far, or &s;tretch the &s;tring till it broke; a new Method was contrived, the Sum of <HI>Fifty Thou|&s;and Pounds</HI> was made, to Let out to the Inhabitants of this Province, on their Real E&s;tates; and they took it up upon Intere&s;t. Mortgaging their Real E&s;tates for tho&s;e Bills, and to pay Intere&s;t for the &s;ame. About this time the Silver being pretty well drained from the Country&punc; the Bills Out&s;tanding on the former Fund, continually going in to the Trea&s;ury, in Order to be Sunk; it was contrived to alter the Fund, and put off the payment for a longer time, by le&s;&s;en|ing the Tax about one half. This being not a &s;uffi|cient &s;top, it was brought to about a quarter part, and I think continues thereabouts to this day, the other being put off for tho&s;e who come after, in reality. Altho' we are told, the Impo&s;t and Exci&s;e makes it up; yet it is plain, the fir&s;t Fund was not upheld, if it had, the fir&s;t Bills, I mean tho&s;e before the <HI>Fifty Thou&s;and Pounds,</HI> had been now (if not alto|gether) yet almo&s;t at an end. Every Mans hands, not being full of Paper. Money as yet, Out comes an
<PB N="9" REF="002291_0010_0fdb1bc9ea74e580" MS="y">
other Flood of Paper, <HI>A Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds,</HI> in much like manner, as the Fifty Thou&s;and Pounds, upon Real E&s;tates, to pay Intere&s;t for the &s;ame. And here we come to a &s;tand at pre&s;ent; and I hope will &s;tand; or my Country will be in a great mea|&s;ure lo&s;t. Time will not allow me, to be &s;o particu|lar, as to recite the &s;everal Laws; I &s;hall keep as near to Matter of Fact, as my Acquaintance with the&s;e things will allow me. But to proceed,</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>Whether the Po&s;tponing of the Province Bills, did &s;ave the Intere&s;t of the Country&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> prejudicial to the Credit of the Bills?</HI></P>
<P>And here, I do think, was &s;uch a &s;troke <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to the le&s;&s;ening of the Value of the&s;e Bills, that will not ea&s;ily be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> I would de&s;ire in this Ca&s;e, to bring the &s;tate of a Province, to a particular Man, and indeed, it is no other; Altho' we were told, at the time of the Altering the Fund, it was only a breach of promi&s;e made to our Selves. But I mu&s;t ask their pardon, who &s;ay &s;o, and I will begin with the fir&s;t coming out of the Bills, and &s;ay, Had there not been Men of Sub&s;tance in this Country, &s;ome that had Money, and &s;ome that had Goods; you might have made Paper Bills till you had been blind, they would never have fed your Bellies, nor have clothed your Backs. I pray, that would in Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds, in Paper-Bills have &s;ignified, to have been made, when the <HI>Indians</HI> Inhabited this Country; &s;o that it's plain, they have a Credit from &s;ome Sub|&s;tance that the People, among&s;t when they are, Injoy. And now let me &s;uppo&s;e, That a Man come to you, that Read this Paper, and de&s;ire you to Lend him a Thou&s;and Pounds, or any &s;maller Sum, telling you he will give his Bond, to pay you in Twelve Months; and at the Years end, he comes and tells you, I can pay you but Five hundred, I will pay you the other the next Year. And at the next Years end, he comes
<PB N="10" REF="002291_0011_0fdb1bcb61fd5ec8">
and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> you, I will pay but Two hundred and fifty. I w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">l pay you the other hereafter: would you not think <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> is a &s;trange Man; would you not take the benefit of the Law upon him, or u&s;e &s;ome means or other to get your Money; or at lea&s;t, would not his Credit be fallen with you; would not a Merchant, a Shop-keeper, making the &s;ame compari&s;on, be of the &s;ame mind. Doubtle&s;s, if you &s;peak your Minds in this, you all agree. Well, the &s;ame it is in the ca&s;e of Paper-Bills; the Man that hath an E&s;tate, either Money, Goods, or Lands; &s;o far as his E&s;tate goes, he gives Credit to the&s;e Bills; the Country by an Act promi&s;es to take them again, at &s;uch a time, but do not; Surely, this le&s;&s;ens the Mans Credit of them: I will not, (&s;aith he) Sell &s;o much Silver, or Gold, or Goods, or Hou&s;es, or Lands, for the Paper Bills, as I did before. And this may &s;erve to &s;how that the Al|tering of the Fund, hath been prejudicial to the value of the&s;e Bills.</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>Whether there be any One In&s;tance in the whole World of Paper Bills being Serviceable to a Kingdom. State, or Province; were e&s;pecially to the&s;e Provinces in</HI> America?</P>
<P>It is well known to all Per&s;ons who are acquainted with the other parts of the World, either by Tra|velling, or Reading the Hi&s;tories of them, That &s;eve|ral parts have made u&s;e of Paper Notes and Bills. And I do think on Emergent Occa&s;ions, and in times of great &s;traits and difficulties, they may have been Serviceable, and in &s;uch times only. So it was with us in our fir&s;t Expedition to <HI>Canada.</HI> And could the door have been &s;hut, that they had been paid off, and the Fund Complyed with, and no more Bills made; It might have been well. But the opening &s;uch a door to the making more Bills, and continuing for near Thirty Years, in my Opinion, is &s;uch a Damage, that I do think it would have been better the Country had given Twenty <HI>per Cent.</HI> for Money, than to have

But if they wanted &s;uch a Sum of Silver&punc; or Gold now, it would be more difficult for them to come at it. As great as &s;ome Men would have the Country to be.

South</HI> and <HI>North Carolina.</HI> As for <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> I have a little Inquired into the &s;tate of that I&s;land of one who was an Eye-Witne&s;s to the proceedings there. A cer|tain Gentleman going out of this Country about the Year 1702. and being received into favour with the Government in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> Advi&s;ed them of the great benefit that Paper Bills were to this Government.

B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the Tax being for &s;o &s;hort a time, and no Bills to back them, they rai&s;ed their value again to be near as good as Silver-Money. But then, came forth an other &s;et of Bills, called Bank-Bills, to the Value, or Number of <HI>Eighty Thou&s;and Pounds,</HI> put out by the Trea&s;urer of the I&s;land, and let upon Land Secu|rity, in the &s;ame manner as I am Informed with our <HI>Fifty,</HI> and <HI>Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds</HI>; and the Term they were to have it, was <HI>Five Years,</HI> at <HI>Four per Cent.</HI> The&s;e Bills being I&s;&s;ued forth, &s;oon fell in Value Forty <HI>per Cent.</HI> below Silver-Money.

<P>As to <HI>South Carolina,</HI> the Fund I am not &s;o able to give an account of; but this I have heard from them, that the Credit of their Bills hath run &s;o low, that Silver-Money hath been Sold for <HI>Thirty-&s;even Shillings</HI> and <HI>Six Pence,</HI> and <HI>Forty Shillings per Ounce.</HI> And <HI>North Carolina.</HI> their Bills have been &s;o out of Credit, that they would buy hardly any thing of the produce of the Country.</P>

<P>This Article I take to be of Con&s;iderable Moment, to this my poor Country, and I could wi&s;h them the Advice of the be&s;t Men in the World, in an&s;wering to a

bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;o great a concern. I know the Country <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> greatly divided at this day in this matter; but be|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">re our Paper-Money, or rather after the coming out of &s;ome of it, we fell into a very great di&s;order rela|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing to our Silver Money. When it was brought to go by Tale, evil-minded Men made a trade of clipping, rounding, filing, and deba&s;ing the Money; and by that means, our Paper Bills in &s;ome mea&s;ure lo&s;t their Credit being equal but to that light Money then pa&s;|&s;ing. Whereas, when they came fir&s;t out, the Money was at <HI>Seventeen Penny</HI> weight. We may remember it was the &s;ame in the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> in the time of the late King <HI>William,</HI> as to the deba&s;ing the Coyn; but that Wi&s;e Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nce made a thorough Alteration in that affair, by calling in all the Old Money; and new-coyning it. Truly, it look'd like a hard and difficult thing, in&s;omuch I have heard that the <HI>French</HI> King &s;hould &s;ay upon it, If this doth not undoe him, nothing will. But this very thing proved the greate&s;t Service to the Nation of any thing done for many Generati|ons. And I do think it a thing of great concern to any People to keep their Coyn at a &s;teady price, and not to waver, and make alterations. But let us a lit|tle con&s;ider of the profit made by the&s;e Paper Bills. I will fir&s;t begin with the Merchant, and ask what he hath got? I confe&s;s a <HI>Medium</HI> &s;eems as nece&s;&s;ary for him as any body: but without a <HI>good Medium,</HI> you had better have none at all, and come to Barter; which I acknowledge is difficult. But look a little into your Books, con&s;ider what &s;tock you began with; if you had <HI>One Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> Silver Money at <HI>Seventeen Penny Weight,</HI> at your fir&s;t &s;etting out; and have not no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Seveteen Hundred</HI> and <HI>Fifty</HI> in Paper Bills, or the value of them; you have gone behind hand; and its time to con&s;ider whether the&s;e Bills have done you any Service? Indeed &s;ome Men have grown rich in the time of this Paper Money; and &s;o it will always be, an alteration in Families, if there were no Medium at
<PB N="16" REF="002291_0017_0fdb1bd81f452468">
all. But the ca&s;e rightly &s;tated is thus, Whether the Merchants in general have gained according to the above proportion? Nextly, Ile ask the Landlords of Hou&s;es, that put out your Money at <HI>Seventeen Penny Weight.</HI> Whether you have got the Intere&s;t of your Monies, making the difference between Silver and Paper, as it now pa&s;&s;es. Some, I am informed, built Hou&s;es in the Town of Bo&s;ton, when Money was at <HI>Seventeen Penny Weight,</HI> that do not &s;ee above Four <HI>per Cent.</HI> Rents in Paper Bills. Con&s;idering your repairs, I do think you had as good even to have kept your Money in your Che&s;t. I will next ask the U&s;erers, What progre&s;s you have made, and whether or not the Money let by you at Six <HI>per Cent.</HI> hath not fallen in the value, near as much hitherto as the Intere&s;t came to? I will next ask the Gold, and Silver Smiths, What progre&s;s they have made, Whether working tho&s;e Mettals has not been le&s;&s;ened in proportion to the growing Country &s;ince the new found Medium; or whether the Merchant hath not rai&s;ed the price of Silver and Gold upon you? I will next ask the Men that live upon Sa|laries; as Mini&s;ters, School-ma&s;ters; Whether you are better-&s;upplyed by the Paper Bills, or whether it hath not forced you to &s;eek for larger Salaries? I will next ask the Poor-labourer, that works for <HI>Five Shil|lings per</HI> day, half Money, half Goods, Whether he lives better now than when he received <HI>Four Shillings</HI> a day in good Silver Money, at the rate of <HI>Seventeen Penny Weight</HI> for <HI>Six Shillings</HI>?</P>
<P>But unto all this it will be an&s;wered, Silver Money is gone, and how &s;hall we get it again? For an&s;wer, I do think the People &s;eem to be &s;o &s;pirited in that matter, they will not have it till nece&s;&s;ity forces it upon them; I do think of all the Plantations in His Maje&s;ty's Dominions, none &s;o capable of having Silver Money, as this Province, con&s;idering the great quan|tity of Fi&s;h, and Oyl rai&s;ed out of the Sea; the Fi&s;h all Selling for Money: and a great quantity of Ships

built, which Trade to mo&s;t parts of the World; and might do to many more; and the ability of the Pro|vince to &s;upply it &s;elf with Victuals and Clothes. I do think none &s;o able as this Province to be furni&s;hed with a Medium of Trade. But after all, if the Door be not &s;hut again&s;t Paper-money, the Door will never be open for Silver-Money to come in Shut but the Door again&s;t Paper-Money, and if the Silver d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t come in in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;uitable to our wants; you &s;hall &s;ay, I am a blind man, or a mad man, or what you plea&s;e to call me. The Quantity of Bills out in this Government. I &s;uppo&s;e is not above <HI>Two Hundred Thou|&s;and Pounds</HI> of all &s;orts; and the Fi&s;h and Oyl caught every Year produces near that Money. Now how ea&s;y would it be to get a Medium, did not the Country in general &s;et them&s;elves again&s;t it. For the fini&s;hing this head, I &s;hall recommend to you the &s;aying of a Great and Wi&s;e King, quoted in a late Pamphlet, re|lating to a Medium of Trade, Printed in the Town of <HI>Boston,</HI> The &s;aying was, <HI>That its better to</HI> run <HI>through the Fire, than to</HI> walk <HI>through it</HI>: And this I would ap|ply to our ca&s;e as to Paper Bills; not to call them all in at once, but to call them in as they &s;hall become due, according to the Fund they are our upon, and come to a certain Determination, that no more be I&s;&s;ued out; that &s;o all People may know the End of it is coming; and not leave the Poor to de|&s;igning men, to make a prey of them. For Example, in this great work, I would have con&s;ulted the Noble pre&s;ident of the late King <HI>William,</HI> in altering the Coyn in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and the great Service done the <HI>I&s;land</HI> of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> in putting a full &s;top to their Paper Bills. They have &s;ince had a competency or Silver Money; whereas had their Paper Bills gone on, they had been drained of their Silver, as we are</P>
<P>As to the &s;everal &s;orts of men before mentioned, at Merchants, Landlords, U&s;erers, Gold&s;miths, Salary Men, and Labourers by the Day, which exceed in num|ber
<PB N="18" REF="002291_0019_0fdb1bdd6f2fe520">
all the re&s;t: And add to the&s;e the Husbandmen, which exceed in number all other Trades and Callings what&s;oever, in this Country. And I wonder the mo&s;t of all at them who get their living out of the ground, that they &s;hould be &s;o diligent in Mortgaging their Lands to make a Medium for the Merchant to Trade on. And now one would think I &s;hould have the greate&s;t part of the&s;e &s;everal denominations of man, joyn hand in hand in putting a Seal end to all Bills of Credit. But here lyes the bane of all, The&s;e &s;everal &s;orts of men are to be brought into two Parties; the man <HI>Free from Debt</HI> to his Neighbours; and the man In|volved in <HI>Debt,</HI> that he knows not how to get out. And here's the unhappine&s;s of all Societies of men, when ever they come together. There are many involved in Debt, their ingagements are &s;o great, and &s;elf love &s;o powerful; its hard to foregoe dear Self; and here I am out-voted. Upon the whole, I doubt not but be|fore Seven Years have pa&s;&s;ed over our heads, if we live to &s;ee that time, we &s;hall &s;ee things of this nature, in another Form; for I think the Makers of Paper Bills, are almo&s;t out of breath, for want of a Fund to bring them out upon. There have been of late &s;everal things talk'd of in the late Pamphlets di&s;per&s;ed about the Country. One great thing propo&s;ed hath been the building a Bridge over <HI>Charles River,</HI> and that it would be a Service to us, to have Paper-Bills come out of the Trea&s;ury for this work. This I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ook at to be next to building Ca&s;tles in the Air. For if we cou'd &s;ink <HI>Forty</HI> or <HI>Fifty Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> in building &s;uch a Bridge, the matter is uncertain, whether it would an&s;wer the end. For I can't learn of a fa&s;t Bridge over &s;uch a River, where there is &s;uch a Stream, in the whole World; and if the project &s;hould fail, where are your Paper-Bills then? But if the thing &s;hould take, the Country would be but &s;o much in Debt, and would not be &s;upplyed with a Medium, if they &s;hould build &s;uch a Bridge every Year. They
<PB N="19" REF="002291_0020_0fdb1bdf21751810">
may, it's true, rai&s;e Bills of Credit, and put off the payment for many Years. But if they &s;hould do &s;o, they will hardly de&s;erve the Name of Bills of <HI>Credit</HI>; their Credit would run &s;o low. Some talk of Fortify|ing the <HI>Ea&s;tern Country,</HI> and the <HI>Frontiers,</HI> &s;o far as is ne|ce&s;&s;ary. As to that, I hope the Country will do what is nece&s;&s;ary. But to do that to make a Medium, I think is wholly be&s;ide our Intere&s;t. Upon the whole, I do think we have gone as far with Bills of Credit, as out Credit will bear; and it's time wholly to &s;uppre&s;s them; and I do think Nece&s;&s;ity calls for it.</P>
<P N="6">VI. <HI>I &s;hall con&s;ider &s;omething of the State of my poor Neighbours that have borrowed the&s;e Province Bills on their E&s;tates; And what mu&s;t be done for their Relief, under the difficult Circum&s;tances they are brought into</HI>?</P>
<P>The condition of my poor Neighbours, I &s;hall in &s;ome &s;ort de&s;cribe, by bringing the compari&s;on to a Single man, which I think the true way to de&s;cribe things of this nature. I will then &s;uppo&s;e, That one of my Country-men is in want of Money, his Neighbour hath not more than for his own u&s;e; but the man in want comes to his Neighbour and &s;aith to him, <HI>Neighbour. Your Credit is better than mine, give your Bond for me, and I will Mortgage my Hou&s;e and Land to you, for your be|coming Surety for me, and I will be Obliged to pay you Five</HI> per Cent. per Annum <HI>for your kindne&s;s in being Surety for me.</HI> The rich man, one would think, &s;hould grow rich apace, and the poor man grow poor as fa&s;t. But the rich and poor being Neighbours, and living one by the other, the rich man is forced to forgive his Neigh|bour part of the Debt, or el&s;e they both fall in Cre|dit together; altho' the rich hath a great advantage over the poor. And this I take in &s;ome &s;ort to be the &s;tate of this Province, and tho&s;e who have borrowed Money from it. We will &s;ay there is but <HI>Two Hun|dred Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> in the Province, the Province hath <HI>One Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> in their own hands, and let
<PB N="20" REF="002291_0021_0fdb1be0b0d816e0">
it out at Five <HI>per Cent.</HI> to an hundred men, and this Money is let to men that have Real E&s;tates; not men of Trade, but few; not great Landlords; they are generally wi&s;er than to take it; if they do. will &s;oon return it; not to U&s;erers, they have no need of it; not much to Merchants, becau&s;e the needy part of them have not Real E&s;tates to Mortgage for it. But it is generally a poor man that hath a piece of Land, and wants to build a Hou&s;e upon it; or a man that hath a Farm, and no Stock; or his Farm not big enough to maintain his Family; or be&s;ides his Farm he wants to be fingering of Trade, or to keep a Ta|vern, or &s;uch like. But alas! the Money in turning once or twice, gets into the hand of the Merchant, Landlord, or U&s;erer; and the poor man that fir&s;t bor|rowed it, hardly ever &s;ees it again; he can't get &s;o much as will pay the Intere&s;t; what think yon will he do to get the Principal? The end is, his Hou&s;e and Land goes to the Country. Well, what will the rich man do with his poor Neighbour, he can't make Mo|ney of him; his Hou&s;e and Land will lye dead, unim|proved, it will pay no Taxes; Why the rich man con|cludes, I'le put my Neighbour into his Hou&s;e again, and take no Intere&s;t of him, provided I can make good for my being Surety for him And the Country may depend upon it, That all the Money they will get from the&s;e Mortgaged E&s;tates, will never be near &s;o much as they delivered out, for both Intere&s;t and Principal. A few Years will fill the Court with Petitions on this &s;ubject, and &s;omething mu&s;t be done to ea&s;e them. I would not be thought to fault the Court in this affair; but the People who have brought this upon them&s;elves, and I do think &s;omething mu&s;t &s;peedily be done for their Relief. If a Committee were cho&s;en by the Court to &s;et the price of the produce of the Country &s;omething higher than the Market price; or if it were confined only to Flax and Hemp; and the Trea&s;urer receive it of or in the behalf of the Committee who
<PB N="21" REF="002291_0022_0fdb1be4988701c8">
let the Bills, at a price &s;et by a Committee cho&s;en for that purpo&s;e, and ordered to &s;et the price &s;omething higher than the Market. Something of this nature mu&s;t be done, that your Poor Neighbour may work out his Debt, and &s;o the rich man take up his Bonds and burn them.</P>
<P>VII. <HI>I &s;hall con&s;ider &s;omething of the State of my Country, what it was before we had any Bills of Credit; and what it is at this day; And &s;o &s;hall wind up my thoughts on this Affair.</HI></P>
<P><HI>New-England</HI> in its fir&s;t Settlement, was &s;etled by men of generous principles, and were accounted men of good Morals; but they had their difficulties in their &s;ettling the&s;e Colonies; A va&s;t number of <HI>Indian</HI> Enemies to encounter with. But they were carried through tho&s;e difficulties in a great mea&s;ure, before we fell into the Labyrinth of Bills of Credit. The Money they brought with them, and had acquired by their Care and Indu&s;try, was good. The <HI>New-England</HI> Shillings, and other pieces Coyned here, were as good Silver, if not better, than the Sterling-Money of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> And the Fi&s;hing Trade brought in con&s;ide|rable Quantities of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> pieces of Eight, and &s;ome other Coyns we had pa&s;&s;ing among&s;t us; &s;o that the condition we were in (con&s;idering the Infancy of the Country, and the many Enemies they had to En|counter with) was as flouri&s;hing as could be expected. The People in that day were generally good Husbands, every man that could get a Hou&s;e &amp; Land, it was gene|rally his own, that is, It was not Mortgaged, or In|cumbred with Debts upon it. Although the Hou&s;e was &s;maller than our Hou&s;es now generally are; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t the man cho&s;e rather to live in it, than to Mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gage it, to make a fine Hou&s;e. Altho' &s;ome had their Ex|travagancies then, as well as now; yet it was not &s;o general; a man that had Mortgaged his E&s;tate then, was look'd upon next door to a Bankrupt. Many now

living can remember it &s;o to be accounted. The Country when our Province Bills were made, I do &s;uppo&s;e had not le&s;s than <HI>One Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> in Silver Money at <HI>Seventeen Penny</HI> Weight, for <HI>Six Shil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">s,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nning Ca&s;h, circulating in Trade; and at lea&s;t <HI>One Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> more, that did not circulate I do think I could name Five Families in the Country, that had <HI>Fifty Thou&s;and Pounds,</HI> which they made no u&s;e of in that day. And other People, doubt|le&s;s had <HI>Fifty Thou&s;and</HI> more, which made up <HI>Two Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds.</HI> But &s;ince, its well drained out of their hands. The Trade was not &s;o great in tho&s;e days as it hath been &s;ince. But what Trade they had, was carried on with much greater advan|tage to the Trader, than now it is. Every hone&s;t Labourer was hone&s;tly paid for his work, in general, without troubling his Neighbour in the Law for his pay; and the&s;e things con&s;idered, I think the Country was very happy at that day on Temporal accounts.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now con&s;ider that the Country is at this day. Altho' we have a con&s;iderable number of men of generous Principles, and good Morals, following the Steps of their Fore-fathers; yet there is a Gene|ration of men among&s;t us of a &s;elfi&s;h, contriving Spirit, who con&s;ider more their own Intere&s;t, and their Friends, than the Publick good. As to the <HI>Indian</HI> War, which was &s;o hard upon the Country formerly; I would hope it is pretty well come to an end, con|&s;idering the &s;mall number of <HI>Indians</HI> left, that were in Ho&s;tility with us; and the increa&s;e of the Province in numbers of men; and the good Agreement be|tween <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>France</HI>; the <HI>French</HI> being the Supporters and Incouragers of the <HI>Indians,</HI> in a time of War: that I hope that matter is pretty near come to a &s;tand This we owe to the good Hand of Pro|vidence over us, and not to any means of our own.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="002291_0024_0fdb1be720448f20">And now I come to con&s;ider the State of the Country at this day as to a <HI>Medium,</HI> and what the Con&s;equences of it are.</P>
<P>I do &s;uppo&s;e there may be near about <HI>Fifty Thou|&s;and Pounds</HI> of the old Province Bills yet out&s;tanding, the Fund being altered, and the time of payment put of for longer time; I mean tho&s;e Bills which were Emitted, before any Bills were made to lend to par|ticular men upon Loan. Then there is one Loan of <HI>Fifty Thou&s;and Pounds,</HI> and another of <HI>One Hundred Thou|&s;and Pounds</HI>; all makes the Sum of <HI>Two Hundred Thou|&s;and Pounds.</HI> This is the only <HI>Medium</HI> this Province injoys. Indeed there are Bills of the Neighbouring Provinces pa&s;&s;ing among&s;t us; but then we do &s;up|po&s;e they have as many, or more, of ours in the room of them. But one of our Neighbour Provinces is &s;o wi&s;e, that I am told, they are going to &s;hut up their Bank. I wi&s;h the re&s;t may be &s;o wi&s;e as to follow them &s;peedily; that the Generation that led&punc; in this Error, may lead out of it; and not leave their Children in the dark. Now I would make &s;ome Compari&s;on of our State. Formerly we had <HI>Two Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> in good Ca&s;h; now we have <HI>Two Hundred Thou|&s;and Pounds</HI> in Paper-Bills; and the&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ills have driven away our Ca&s;h; and yet the cry is, <HI>We are richer than formerly.</HI> But it &s;eems to me, we have &s;pent the <HI>Two Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> of Ca&s;h, and are become <HI>Two Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> in Debt. O &s;ay &s;ome men, <HI>We are in Debt to our Selves, and &s;o no great matter.</HI> But I de&s;ire to know, where is the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fference, if the Coun|try borrow of them&s;elves Paper Bills, and put them out, they doubtle&s;s de&s;ign to take them in again, and if they take them, and let to the Inhabitants, they doubtle&s;s intend to receive them again; &s;o that the Country are Indebted to them&s;elves for <HI>Fifty Thou&s;and Pounds,</HI> and the Inhabitants are Indebted to the Coun|try for <HI>One Hundred</HI> and <HI>Fifty Thou&s;and Pounds,</HI> and this it all our <HI>Medium</HI> of Exchange. Now this fine <HI>Medium</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="002291_0025_0fdb1beba059e7f8">
of Exchange hath co&s;t us all our Silver Money; and our Plate, (of which our Country was well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in former days) is now flying from us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">&punc; I am told, That in the la&s;t Ships that Sailed this Win|ter, &s;ome Thou&s;ands of Pounds worth of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Plate was Ship'd off for <HI>Great Britain</HI>; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> new Plate, as fine Tea-Pots, Coffee-Pots, and &s;undry <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Sorts, made by the be&s;t work-men in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and Sold at the price of Bullion. And how comes this to be? Why, its through our fine <HI>Medium</HI> for Trade. Well, is our Country the better, or richer for all the&s;e things Shipt off. No, but the poorer.</P>
<P>Well, What hath our Country for all this Silver Money and Plate?</P>
<P>Why, we have as good Clothes as we can get, and thats even all, or the mo&s;t part: Well, Wherein is our Country Richer, and more flouri&s;hing, than it was formerly? Why, Our great Riches lyes in great Hou&s;es, Co&s;tly Furniture, and rich Cloathing, beyond men of our degree.</P>
<P>Well, Is this all the great Riches you brag of? Why truly, we have nothing more than we had for|merly. The Land we had before, when we had our Silver-Money; but &s;ince the Peace, the Country doth increa&s;e; but in my judgment, it is va&s;tly hindred for want of our <HI>Old Medium</HI>; and every mans thoughts are &s;o taken up about the <HI>New Medium,</HI> That I am of Opinion that if the Country, Owed to a Foreign Pro|vince, a <HI>Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds</HI>; and could get the Paper Bills Intirely, &s;topt, the burden would be much le&s;s than the <HI>Medium</HI> we have now got. For as it is now, the Father is &s;et again&s;t the Son; and the Son again&s;t the Father; Brother again&s;t Brother; Neigh|bour again&s;t Neighbour; a man can't &s;peak to his Neighbour again&s;t making Paper Bills, but he is ready to fly in his face!</P>

<P>There was, not many Years &s;ince, a private Bank on foot in the Town of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> it was thought it would have proved a greater damage than this Publick Bank; but I am of the mind if that had gone on, that this kind of <HI>Medium</HI> would have been at an end before this time: The Credit of that would &s;oon have been &s;pun out. Almo&s;t every mans cry is, <HI>Make more Mo|ney, Make enough</HI>! But every man that hath his eyes about him fees, that every time Paper-Bills are Emit|ted, it rai&s;es all Commodities; That if it were po&s;&s;ible to get out <HI>Five Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds,</HI> it would not fetch &s;o much as <HI>Two Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> now doth.

<P>Some will &s;ay, <HI>It will be a dark time between the&s;e Province Bills, and Silver Money.</HI> It<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s true, we have rea&s;on to fear that; and who may we thank for it?
