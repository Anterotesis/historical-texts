<P>&mdash;And <HI>DAVID</HI> &s;aid unto <HI>SAUL,</HI> I cannot go with The&s;e&punc; For I have not proved Them.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE Armies of the <HI>Phili&s;tines</HI> were now gathered together in the Coa&s;t of <HI>Dammim,</HI> and pitched between <HI>Sho|choh</HI> and <HI>Azekah,</HI> a Place belonging to <HI>Judah</HI>: And, in order to oppo&s;e them, SAUL and the Men of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> were gathered together al&s;o and pitched by the Val|ley of <HI>Elah</HI> and had &s;et the Battle in Array again&s;t them: The former Army &s;tood on a Mountain on one &s;ide; and the latter &s;tood on a Mountain on the other; &s;o that there was only a Valley between them.</P>
<P>Behold now a <HI>Champion marches out of the Camp of the</HI> Phili&s;tines, named GOLIATH, who was of enor|mous Size and formidable Appearance: He comes in
<PB N="6" REF="004389_0005_100D4D7459768630">
warlike Armor complete, and with a <HI>Spear</HI> in parti|cular as much exceeding common ones, as his Sta|ture exceeded the common Stature of Mankind: He <HI>advances to defy the Armies of</HI> I&s;rael, and challenges them to produce a Man that would be &s;o hardy as to encounter him.</P>
<P>SAUL, the unhappy King whom <HI>GOD gave in His Anger</HI> to <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> was pre&s;ent to behold the Sur|prize, the Di&s;order and Confu&s;ion of his enervated People: And all <HI>I&s;rael</HI> were overwhelmed with the fearful Expectation of ignominious and cruel Slavery: <HI>Terror it&s;elf</HI> had chilled the Hearts of the whole <HI>I&s;ra|eliti&s;h</HI> Ho&s;t and cau&s;ed the Faces of the mo&s;t Brave among them to be covered with Di&s;tre&s;s and An|gui&s;h.</P>
<P>At the <HI>View</HI> of &s;uch a tremendous Adver&s;ary, and at the <HI>Hearing his mighty Voice, his daring Challenges and his fierce,</HI> tho' too early <HI>Boa&s;ts and Threatnings,</HI> their <HI>fainting Souls were upon the Wing and the Shades of the Night were ju&s;t ru&s;hing over them.</HI></P>
<P>But now, when there was not a Man of the whole <HI>I&s;raeliti&s;h</HI> Army, that had the Heart to ap|pear for them, to e&s;pou&s;e their Cau&s;e and revenge their Wrongs; Almighty GOD of His ineffable Good|ne&s;s di&s;po&s;ed and excited a brave Soldier to accept the Challenge of the haughty GOLIATH: 'Twas DAVID the great, the good, the generous, who with his gallant, but gentle, Voice revives the Hopes of di&s;heartned <HI>I&s;rael</HI> and recals their departing Spirits.</P>
<P>The intimidated <HI>I&s;raeliti&s;h Monarch</HI> indeed could not at fir&s;t believe and hope, that DAVID by Rea&s;on of his tender Youth was <HI>equal to the va&s;t Encounter,</HI> and therefore endeavours to di&s;&s;wade him from the Tho'ts of it.</P>
<P>But the young Hero, in&s;tead of being di&s;couraged and turned a&s;ide by the Speech of his King, grows rather more courageous and more re&s;olved for the Combate: For he was <HI>&s;trong in the LORD and in the Power of his Might.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="004389_0006_100D4D76F08FF220">Being therefore Divinely fortified in his Mind, he hence &s;ays to his terrified Prince, <HI>Thy Servant will go and fight with this</HI> Phili&s;tine, <HI>&s;eeing he has defied the Armies of the living GOD</HI>; Q. D. Tho' you, my Sovereign, have endeavoured to put me off from my propo&s;ed Encounter, you have only con|firmed me in my valorous Purpo&s;e. 'Tis true GO|LIATH is a Warrior, an old and experienced War|rior, and I allow that I am but a <HI>Learner in the Art of War</HI>: But in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e I have <HI>an un&s;haken Reliance,</HI> not on my own Power and Skill, but on the Recruits and Aids of Divine Power and Grace: The audacious, godle&s;s Giant has reproached our GOD, who therefore mu&s;t be his Enemy: And, when this our GOD is my Friend I have no Doubt but that HE will be <HI>my potent Auxiliary and crown me with Victory and Triumph:</HI> It mu&s;t be acknowledg|ed, that he places great Dependance on the Strength of his Body, the Force of his Valor and the Glory of his Arms: But yet I have much the Advantage of him: For the <HI>Divine Maje&s;ty is my Strength: He is my Deliverer and my Shield; and in Him do I put my Tru&s;t to &s;ubdue</HI> this Gigantic Mortal <HI>under me.</HI></P>
<P>So &s;pake the brave DAVID: And the Con&s;e|quence of his Speech was, that King SAUL was per|&s;waded by it to let him engage with their Enemy: Accordingly, that he might be equip'd for this Pur|po&s;e, we read, in <HI>Ver&s;e twenty ninth</HI> of the preceeding Context, that <HI>SAUL armed DAVID with his Ar|mor,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Some Expo&s;itors have hence ab&s;urdly enow &s;up|po&s;ed, that SAUL put <HI>his own di&s;proportioned and un|&s;uitable Armor</HI> upon him: I &s;aid, They have <HI>ab&s;urdly &s;uppo&s;ed</HI> it: For it is altogether unlikely and incredi|ble, that SAUL &s;hould put the Arms de&s;ign'd and made for his own <HI>Maje&s;tically tall Body,</HI> which over-top'd all <HI>I&s;rael</HI> by the Head, upon the &s;mall Body of DAVID. But others have with more Probabi|lity
<PB N="8" REF="004389_0007_100D4D78795A5F80">
determined, that <HI>this Armor is called</HI> SAUL<HI>'s, becau&s;e it was taken out of his Magazine or Armory.</HI></P>
<P>DAVID then, being thus clad and accoutred ac|cording to the King's Mind, finds that his Arms, in&s;tead of being a Service, would be an Injury to Him and an Impediment to his Victory: He there|fore determines to lay them a&s;ide. <HI>And DAVID &s;aid unto SAUL, I cannot go with The&s;e: For I have not proved them.</HI> Q. D. My Prince and Sovereign, <HI>I am going to fight</HI> with that proud and vain GOLI|ATH: <HI>Tis fit and requi&s;ite, that I have &s;uitable Arms</HI> with which to go again&s;t him: And, as I <HI>have not by proving The&s;e found them to be &s;o, I ought not to go with Them,</HI> but <HI>&s;hould proceed to the Engagement with &s;uch Arms as are mo&s;t proper</HI> for me and which are mo&s;t likely to be u&s;ed well and &s;ucce&s;sfully by me.</P>
<P>By the Words therefore, in this Exhibition of them before us, we are fairly led to endeavour the&s;e three Things, namely,</P>
<P>In the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Place, <HI>To ju&s;tify the Lawfulne&s;s of going to War:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Then, To con&s;ider Arms as requi&s;ite</HI> for them that go to War: And</P>
<P>La&s;tly, <HI>To &s;hew, that Men cannot well, nor &s;hould, go to War but with &s;uch Arms as are proved.</HI></P>
<P>Accordingly, in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Place, <HI>The Lawfulne&s;s of going to War is to be ju&s;tified</HI> by us.</P>
<P>And here we &s;hall readily grant, that <HI>War is a very grievous Calamity and Judgment:</HI> For <HI>It pro|ceeds</HI> for the mo&s;t part from wild <HI>Ambition</HI> or <HI>Cove|tou&s;ne&s;s</HI> or <HI>inordinate Anger</HI> or &s;ome other irregular
<PB N="9" REF="004389_0008_100D4D7A4EFF2C20">
Frame of Mind: And, if it &s;hould be ever &s;o <HI>ju&s;t and righteous as its Cau&s;es</HI>; it is however &s;o <HI>pernici|ous and hateful a Thing</HI> as that no good Man can be well plea&s;ed with it.</P>
<P>For not to mention <HI>the Men</HI> generally improved by States and Princes for carrying it on, who, tho' They be &s;tyled <HI>Regular Forces,</HI> are yet for the mo&s;t Part <HI>faithle&s;s,</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><Q>Nulla Fides Pieta&s;que Viris qui Co&s;tra &s;equuntur. <BIBL><HI>Lucan.</HI> Phar&s;al. <HI>Lib.

<P>But, not to in&s;i&s;t upon This; It is a Thing by no means to be overlook'd or deny'd, that <HI>Men in a Time of War cannot well pur&s;ue their lawful Affairs and Intere&s;ts:</HI> For <HI>Then,</HI> through the Prevalence of <HI>Fear,</HI> the <HI>Labor of the Field</HI> is neglected and the Trade of the Merchant is moor'd.</P>
<P>Nor is This all: But at &s;uch a Time, while <HI>good Laws are &s;ilent</HI> <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Inter Arma &s;ilent Leges.</NOTE> nor allowed to &s;peak their Ter|rors; what <HI>Debaucheries,</HI> what <HI>Thefts and Rapines, and how great a variety of other Villanies are per|petrated?</HI> And, even <HI>after the Extinction of War,</HI> it is next to impo&s;&s;ible but that <HI>this Pe&s;tilence of Man|ners &s;hould continue and rage for a con&s;iderable while.</HI></P>
<P>And be&s;ides; <HI>War is always very chargeable:</HI> And, &s;uppo&s;ing the <HI>War &s;hould terminate with Succe&s;s and Triumph</HI>; yet there is &s;carce any War &s;o hap|pily concluded but that, upon the Review, it will be found <HI>the Lo&s;s &s;u&s;tain'd</HI> is equal to the Benefit and Advantage accruing to the Victor.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="004389_0009_100D4D7C59B07E08">And, which is no &s;mall and incon&s;iderable Un|happine&s;s, <HI>many valiant, u&s;eful and great Men fall Sacrifices in the Day of Battle:</HI>

<P>But however, all the&s;e Things notwith&s;tanding, <HI>War is &s;ometimes requi&s;ite and nece&s;&s;ary:</HI> It is &s;o <HI>for the Recovery of what is unju&s;tly taken away,</HI> and <HI>for the Vindication of &s;ome Wrong &s;u&s;tain'd,</HI> according to the Proportion of the Injury, and <HI>for procuring and e&s;tabli&s;hing de&s;ireable Peace</HI> <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pax quaeritur Bello</HI> was the Motto on the Medals of the great CROMWELL; who had like to have vi&s;ited <HI>New-England,</HI> but was detain'd by Providence for the Deli|verance and Protection of the Kingdom.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>'Tis true there &s;hould be a <HI>Call of &s;ufficient Autho|rity to engage in War:</HI> Nor &s;hould <HI>War</HI> be wag'd but <HI>with a good Intention and Frame of Mind:</HI> But, when <HI>War</HI> is <HI>Thus</HI> not only <HI>commenced,</HI> but <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">nly <HI>pur|&s;ued</HI> al&s;o; and when, in the Pro&s;ecution of it, there is <HI>Fortitude in Dangers, Patience in bearing Hard|&s;hips, Indu&s;try in &s;etting about Things, Coun&s;el in pro|viding for them and Speed in accompli&s;hing them</HI>; Then it is not barely <HI>lawful,</HI> but it is <HI>honorable and glorious.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="004389_0010_100D4D7E600E5068">There have bin indeed many in <HI>Germany</HI> and other Places, who have <HI>condemn'd all going to War as unlawful and wicked:</HI> But, upon due Enquiry and Con&s;ideration, it will be found, that <HI>They know not what they &s;ay nor whereof they affirm.</HI></P>
<P>For it is certainly <HI>agreeable to the Law of Nature,</HI> and &s;o it has unan&s;werably bin proved to be over and over again by learned Civilians, that <HI>a People, as &s;uch, have their ju&s;t Rights and Claims,</HI> that <HI>They may and &s;hould a&s;&s;ert and maintain The&s;e,</HI> and, in &s;o doing, <HI>repel the Violence u&s;ed again&s;t Them</HI> with their be&s;t Forces.</P>
<P>And, altho' the peaceable Men ju&s;t mentioned have taken the Liberty to quote &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages from the Writings of the old and new Covenant, and form'd &s;ome &s;pecious Arguments from them again&s;t going to War; yet it can ea&s;ily be prov'd, as that the <HI>Texts</HI> produc'd are <HI>not well under&s;tood</HI> by them, and con&s;equently <HI>the Arguments collected</HI> from them cannot be good; &s;o that <HI>the Pa&s;&s;ages in Scripture, which are in Favor of going to War, are many and very con&s;iderable.</HI></P>
<P>That GOD in the Law, which He gave to the <HI>Hebrews, directed them with re&s;pect to the Way and Manner wherein They &s;hould proclaim, begin and pro|&s;ecute their Wars,</HI> This cannot rea&s;onably be denied: But now <HI>&s;uch Things as are Evil are rather to be di&s;allowed and forbidden</HI> than <HI>permitted</HI> and even <HI>re|commended</HI> with &s;uitable Statutes and Laws.</P>
<P>It is &s;ugge&s;ted indeed by the Enemies to War afore&s;aid, as if Te&s;timonies from the <HI>Old Te&s;tament</HI> could not be of great Validity in this Ca&s;e; becau&s;e there are many Things to be found in That, which ought not to be imitated by us.</P>
<P>But the Reply to This is ea&s;y, which is, that, altho' it be true, it is nothing to the pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e: For the Things written in the Law of MOSES con|cerning <HI>War</HI> refer to <HI>the Law of Nature,</HI> which is
<PB N="12" REF="004389_0011_100D4D80B3F63F00">
perpetual: It being eternally right and ju&s;t, that the Innocent &s;hould be protected and the Evil and Op|pre&s;&s;ive repre&s;s'd.</P>
<P>And be&s;ides, We read, in the Eleventh to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> concerning DAVID and other ancient Worthies, that <HI>by Faith they &s;ubdued Kingdoms, wax|ed valiant in War and turned to Flight the Armies of the Aliens:</HI> But, if they did the&s;e Things <HI>in the Ex|erci&s;e of Faith,</HI> they <HI>were not then to blame for their thus Warring.</HI></P>
<P>But, in our Scriptural Proofs of the Lawfulne&s;s of going to War, we are <HI>not confined to the Law and the Prophets:</HI> We have <HI>other Te&s;timonies,</HI> be&s;ides The&s;e, to be taken <HI>from the Books of the New Co|venant.</HI></P>
<P>When the Soldiers came to JOHN the Bapti&s;t and a&s;ked him, <HI>What they &s;hould do to be &s;aved?</HI> He <HI>did not advi&s;e them to quit their Service, but to carry them|&s;elves well</HI> in it, namely, by <HI>doing Violence to no Man, by not accu&s;ing any one fal&s;ely and by Contentment with their Wages,</HI> as in Luk. III. 14. And our ble&s;&s;ed SAVIOUR did not require the Centurion to <HI>re&s;ign his Po&s;t,</HI> whom He commends as having <HI>&s;u|perior Faith to any in</HI> I&s;rael, as in Mat. VIII. 10. And we read of CORNELIUS a <HI>Roman</HI> Captain, that, while he was &s;o, <HI>his Prayers and his Alms came up as a Memorial before GOD,</HI> as in Act. X. 4. TER|TULLIAN indeed &s;uppo&s;es, that, after his Conver&s;ion to Chri&s;tianity, he quitted his Po&s;t: And This was the receiv'd Opinion of the Primitive Church: And, if the <HI>Roman Te&s;ts for Soldiers</HI> were then in Force, as They probably might be; for <HI>all above the common Soldiers</HI> <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Called</HI> Milites caligati.</NOTE> were nece&s;&s;arily obliged <HI>to immolate to the Pagan Deities,</HI> as EUSEBIUS a&s;&s;ures us; we mu&s;t then conclude with the learned Mr. MOYLE, that CORNELIUS undoubtedly laid down his Commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="004389_0012_100D4D82CD6C5EF0">But, to go on with our Demon&s;tration; our ble&s;&s;ed LORD requir'd, as in Mat. XXII. 21. <HI>Render unto CAESAR the Things which are CAESAR's:</HI> Now the <HI>Taxes</HI> then collecting were without Que&s;tion ap|plied in Part <HI>for the Defence of the Common-Wealth and the Payment of Wages due to Soldiers:</HI> And the Apo&s;tle PAUL, in Rom. XIII. 4, 6 and 7 Ver&s;es, declares, as he is &s;peaking of the <HI>higher Powers</HI> or <HI>the Civil Magi&s;trate, He is the Mini&s;ter of GOD, a Revenger to execute Wrath upon him that doth Evil: For this Cau&s;e,</HI> proceeds He, <HI>pay you Tribute al&s;o: For they are GOD's Mini&s;ters attending upon this very Thing: Render therefore to all their Dues, Tribute to whom Tribute is due,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>It was, I doubt not, under the con&s;training Power of the&s;e and &s;uch like Pa&s;&s;ages of Holy Writ, that <HI>the Primitive Chri&s;tians &s;erv'd,</HI> as They thought them|&s;elves in Duty bound to do, under the Pagan Empe|rors, as in the <HI>Theban Legion:</HI> And EUSEBIUS tells us, that They fought under the Emperor MARCUS AURELIUS in <HI>Germany</HI> <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">Eu&s;eb.

<P>Let us now, in the <HI>Next</HI> Place, <HI>con&s;ider</HI> Arms <HI>as requi&s;ite for Them that go to War.</HI></P>
<P>For indeed, as DAVID <HI>thought it lawful and a Duty for him to go to War</HI>; &s;o he judg'd it <HI>requi&s;ite to go with &s;uitable Arms:</HI> Accordingly for an <HI>Offen|&s;ive Weapon</HI> He takes <HI>his Sling:</HI> And, if we may

<P>By the Ob&s;ervation of The&s;e and &s;uch like Rules, Dear Sirs, You may <HI>depend upon the Divine Favor and Ble&s;&s;ing, when War &s;hall ari&s;e and an Ho&s;t &s;hall encamp again&s;t You:</HI> So that, when You are <HI>called forth to Battle,</HI> You may &s;ay to your People, as in the Style of DAVID to King SAUL, <HI>The LORD has delivered us from the Paw of the Lion and the Bear; and He will deliver us out of the Hand of the Phili&s;tine,</HI> as in <HI>Ver&s;e thirty &s;eventh</HI> of the preceeding Context: And we, who have a rais'd Opinion of your Valor and Conduct, &s;hall an&s;wer you in the Language of SAUL to the Heroic DAVID, as in the &s;ame <HI>thirty &s;eventh Ver&s;e, Go, and the LORD of Ho&s;ts be with you.</HI></P>

<P>And here, &s;ince it entirely belongs to your EX|CELLENCY to <HI>appoint our Military Officers</HI>; we cannot but hope,</P>

<P>That you will only <HI>honor</HI> &s;uch with Military Com|mi&s;&s;ions as are <HI>Men of Piety, Prudence, Genero&s;ity, &s;uperior Knowledge in Military Affairs and able to &s;upport their Dignity and Authority</HI>; and that, if any of them appointed by your EXCELLENCY fail to an&s;wer the&s;e Characters, you will <HI>take away their Commi&s;&s;ions and give Them to &s;uch as are more worthy of Them</HI> <NOTE N="(v)" PLACE="foot">Detur digniori.</NOTE>: And the Rea&s;on of this our Hope is
<PB N="25" REF="004389_0024_100D4D9AE844F9A8">
a&s;&s;ign'd for us by the wi&s;e Man, who &s;ays, in Prov. XXVI. 8. <HI>As he that bindeth a Stone in a Sling,</HI> or the Military In&s;trument already mention'd called a <HI>Bali&s;ta, &s;o is he that giveth Honor to a Fool:</HI> For the heavy <HI>Stone</HI> and the &s;tupid <HI>Fool</HI> are <HI>alike rais'd</HI> with a View to their doing Execution: But They are <HI>equally in&s;en&s;ible of their Advancement</HI> and <HI>incapable of them&s;elves to do any Thing to Purpo&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>But, as to <HI>the Care of providing again&s;t a Time of War; This belongs to the whole Legi&s;lature:</HI> To you,</P>
<P>Mo&s;t Honored Rulers, It appertains to <HI>rai&s;e need|ful Moneys, to procure &s;uitable Arms, Ammunition and Provi&s;ions and to build and repair Fortifications.</HI></P>
<P>As <HI>Money</HI> is nece&s;&s;ary for carrying on a War and evidently appears to be <HI>the Nerves and vital Spirit</HI> of it; It becomes you, Sirs, to &s;ee to it that <HI>your Trea&s;ury be &s;upplied with Money,</HI> and that it be with <HI>&s;uch Money as is well regulated and e&s;tabli&s;hed</HI>: This, I &s;ay, becomes you <HI>from a due Regard to Righteou&s;|ne&s;s and Hone&s;ty.</HI></P>
<P>Since al&s;o <HI>Arms both of Defence and Annoyance</HI> are requi&s;ite towards maintaining a War; It is incumbent on you to <HI>found an Ar&s;enal or Magazine for all war|like In&s;truments.</HI></P>
<P>Again; As it is <HI>impo&s;&s;ible for Men in a Time of War to hold out again&s;t their Enemies and the Want of Nece&s;&s;aries</HI>; the <HI>Civil Magi&s;trate</HI> therefore &s;hould take Care, that <HI>&s;uch as are employed in their Service have their Backs well covered and their Stomachs &s;a|tisfied with good Provi&s;ions.</HI></P>
<P>And, ina&s;much as <HI>Fortifications</HI> are for the Safety of your Subjects and the Security of our Properties; It is undoubtedly the Province of our mo&s;t Honored Legi&s;lators to <HI>build &s;uch in the Places mo&s;t convenient for Them:</HI> And, Sirs, allow me to &s;peak it with Freedom, If you do <HI>not think it proper to erect any

<P>And here it may be of Con&s;equence to ob&s;erve, that we have <HI>very few</HI> Per&s;ons, as I have Rea&s;on to believe, in the Province who are <HI>ver&s;ed in the Art of Gunnery: This,</HI> if it &s;hould be a <HI>Time of War,</HI> We &s;hould find to be a <HI>va&s;t Inconvenience:</HI> I would there|fore humbly move it to the Legi&s;lature, <HI>Whether it would not be well for Them to pay for the Schooling of a meet Number of Per&s;ons</HI> to <HI>learn this nece&s;&s;ary Art.</HI></P>

<P><HI>The&s;e Weapons,</HI> like the Warfare in which they are to be u&s;ed, <HI>are &s;piritual,</HI> but <HI>powerful and mighty:</HI> For our &s;uprerne LORD and Commander may ad|dre&s;s us with much more Truth and Propriety than BELISARIUS his Army, when he was about to put &s;ome lewd Soldiers to Death, <Q>Know, that I am <HI>come to fight with the Arms of Religion and Ju&s;tice,</HI> without which neither Victory nor Happine&s;s is to be expected: I de&s;ire my <HI>Soldiers &s;hould have their Hands clean</HI> to kill an Enemy: Never will I &s;uffer any Man in my Army that has <HI>Fingers crooked or bloody,</HI> were he in Arms as terrible as Lightning: <HI>Force</HI> is of no Con&s;equence, if <HI>it have not Equity and Con&s;cience for Companions</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Procop.

<P>But here, that &s;o we may be <HI>acquainted with the whole Armor of GOD and put it on</HI>; I &s;hall fetch it out from <HI>the Tower of the Son of</HI> DAVID, e&s;pecially from <HI>that Apartment</HI> of it the <HI>Sixth</HI> Chapter to the <HI>Ephe&s;ians.</HI></P>
<P>Here, Sirs, is <HI>a fine Belt</HI> for us.

<P>And here, <HI>Fellow Soldiers,</HI> is a <HI>Divine Brea&s;t-plate</HI> for us: 'Tis <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s:</HI> Which may denote <HI>an univer&s;al and impartial Obedience to the Divine Laws:</HI> For <HI>This will defend and guard our Hearts</HI> again&s;t the Detractions and Calumnies of a ba&s;e and malici|ous World: And, in <HI>wearing this Piece of Armor,</HI> we &s;hall appear like our &s;upreme Officer: For of Him it is written in I&s;a.

<P>In the <HI>next</HI> Place; If we want <HI>Armor for our Feet,</HI> here it is for us: And we are <HI>to be &s;hod with this Preparation of the Go&s;pel of Peace.</HI> As it was u&s;ual in ancient Times to <HI>fix &s;hort Stakes and ca&s;t Gall-Traps</HI> in the Way of the Enemy to hurt their Feet and make them fall; and for this Cau&s;e the Soldiers had a <HI>Sort of Boot</HI> for their <HI>Feet and Legs</HI> to accommodate and arm them again&s;t the Inconveni|ences to which they were expo&s;ed: Even &s;uch is the Ca&s;e now: For <HI>in our Way to Victory and Triumph, we &s;hall meet with Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, Lets and Impediments.</HI> But, to <HI>keep us from many Wounds and Injuries,</HI> we have <HI>the Go&s;pel</HI>; which is called <HI>the Go&s;pel of Peace,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>it reveals, propo&s;es and e&s;tabli&s;hes a Peace be|tween GOD and Man: This Go&s;pel</HI> then let us take, with its Directions and Comforts: And <HI>This</HI> will be a <HI>wondrous Preparation again&s;t the Evils,</HI> the wor&s;t of <HI>Evils,</HI> to be encountred.</P>
<P>And then; Becau&s;e <HI>we cannot fight &s;ecurely with|out a Shield,</HI> here is one for us: The Name of it is <HI>the Shield of Faith</HI>; and it is <HI>equal to quenching all the
<PB N="31" REF="004389_0030_100D4DA6A25F83C8">
fiery Darts of the Wicked.</HI> Like the poi&s;onous <HI>Scy|thian Darts,</HI> which in flying caught on Fire and inflam'd the Bodies which they pierc'd, are <HI>the Darts &s;hot again&s;t our Souls</HI> by Satan to enflame them: But, as the ancient Warriors had <HI>Shields of raw Neats Leather to quench the Power and Venom of the&s;e Darts</HI>; &s;o we are now <HI>provided with Armor to quench the fiery Darts of the Wicked:</HI> 'Tis the <HI>Shield of Faith; that Faith,</HI> which is <HI>the Sub&s;tance of Things hoped for and the Evidence of Things not &s;een</HI>; and <HI>that Faith in our Prince and Saviour,</HI> which covers all the Defects of our Obedience and <HI>is imputed unto us for Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>But we are not yet fully provided <HI>with our De|fen&s;ive Armor:</HI> We mu&s;t have <HI>&s;ome for our Head:</HI> Here then <HI>is an Helmet</HI> for us: It is <HI>the Helmet of Salvation</HI>; or what is el&s;ewhere called, <HI>the Hope of Salvation.</HI> Our Divine Commander has <HI>put this Helmet on His Head,</HI> as we may &s;ee in I&s;a.

<P>We have now <HI>Armor &s;ufficient for our Defence:</HI> But, that &s;o we may be able not only <HI>to &s;tand,</HI> but to <HI>re&s;i&s;t and oppo&s;e the Enemies of our Souls,</HI> we &s;hould <HI>have &s;ome offen&s;ive Arms:</HI> Well Sirs: And here is <HI>the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of GOD,</HI> for us: Concerning this Weapon we may &s;ay, as DAVID concerning <HI>the Sword of the &s;lain GOLIATH, There is none like it:</HI> With <HI>This</HI> our great LORD conquered His and our Adver&s;ary; pa&s;&s;ing <HI>it is written</HI> at him to his Foiling and &s;hameful Retreat: And the &s;ame &s;hould we <HI>brandi&s;h

and pu&s;h again&s;t our a&s;&s;aulting, &s;piritual Foe,</HI> who &s;eeks our De&s;truction.</P>
<P>Nor yet are we provided with <HI>all our Armor:</HI> But, moreover, we are to <HI>pray always with all Manner of Prayer and Supplication in the Spirit, watching thereunto with Per&s;everance:</HI> When <HI>the Devil, the Fle&s;h and the World</HI> come forth again&s;t us and are furious in their On&s;ets, we mu&s;t, like JEHOSHAPHAT in his Di&s;tre&s; and the Emperor THEODOSIUS in his Extremities, <HI>cry to GOD with Fervor, Con&s;tancy and Importunity:</HI> And, accord|ing to Military Rule or Order, we mu&s;t <HI>continue upon our Watch,</HI> until we are <HI>reliev'd</HI> and even until we are <HI>di&s;charg'd from our Warfare</HI> by Death, like <HI>tru&s;ty Centinels upon Duty.</HI></P>
<P>Thus are we now entirely <HI>furni&s;h'd with fit Armor for us,</HI> not only <HI>to defend and guard</HI> us, but al&s;o <HI>for re&s;i&s;ting and vanqui&s;hing our &s;piritual Enemies.</HI></P>
<P>It remains now, that we &s;hould <HI>prove this our Armor:</HI> Let us then be <HI>daily and con&s;tantly in the Exerci&s;e of it:</HI> For <HI>U&s;e will make us perfect</HI> in the Exerci&s;e: So we &s;hall be <HI>prepar'd for the Battle</HI> continually, tho' the Enemy &s;hould have the Har|dine&s;s to rally ever &s;o often again&s;t us: And &s;o we &s;hall come off <HI>Conquerors and more than Con|querors,</HI> even con&s;iderable Gainers <NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot"><Q><HI>Praemia nunc alia atque alia Emolumenta notemus</HI> Sacramentorum: h. e.

<P>And indeed This is no more than what may be rea&s;onably expected; &s;ince <HI>JESUS our LORD is for us and with us.</HI> After the Conver&s;ion of the Emperors to the Faith, the <HI>Te&s;&s;era</HI> or Word among Them frequently was <HI>DEUS nobi&s;cum:</HI> And it
