<P>AS all young men, on their fir&s;t out&s;et in life, are in want <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ome experienced and friendly hand to bring them for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and teach them a knowledge of the world; I think I cannot do the ri&s;ing generation a greater &s;ervice, than by directing the young man's &s;teps, and teaching him how to make his way among the crowd. I will &s;uppo&s;e him already in&s;tructed in the principles of religion and the nece&s;&s;ity of moral virtues: (for without the&s;e he mu&s;t be mo&s;t un|happy) of cour&s;e &s;hall, in a &s;eries of chapters, point out under di&s;tin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> heads, the qualifications nece&s;&s;ary to make him well received <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> world, without which he cannot expect to bear his part in life, agree|able to his own wi&s;hes, or the duty he owes to &s;ociety; and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ty is the ba&s;is of a proper reception, I &s;hall begin with that.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>MODESTY.</HEAD>
<P>MODESTY is a polite accompli&s;hment, and generally an attendant upon merit&punc; It is engaging in the highe&s;t degree, and wins the hearts of all our acquaintance. On the contrary, none are more di&s;gu&s;tful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> company than the impudent and pre|&s;uming.</P>
<P>The man who is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> occa&s;ions, commending and &s;peaking well of him&s;elf, we naturally di&s;like. On the other hand, he who &s;tu|dies to conceal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> de&s;erts, who does ju&s;tice to the merit of others, who talks <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> little of him&s;elf, and that with mode&s;ty, makes a favourable impre&s;&s;ion on the per&s;ons he is conver&s;ing with, capti|vates their minds, and gains their e&s;teem.</P>
<P>Mode&s;ty, however, widely differs from an awkward ba&s;hfulne&s;s, which is as much to be condemned as the other is to be applauded. To appear &s;imple is as ill-bred as to be impudent. A young man ought to be able to come into a room and addre&s;s the company without the lea&s;t embarra&s;&s;ment. To be out of countenance when &s;poken to, and not to have an an&s;wer ready, is ridiculous to the la&s;t degree.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="027039_0005_0FD2F9C40C1B5D80">
An awkward country fellow, when he comes into company better than him&s;elf, is exceedingly di&s;concerted. He knows not what to do with his hands or his hat, but either puts one of them in his pocket, and dangles the other by his &s;ide; or perhaps twirls his hat on his fingers, or fumbles with the button. If &s;poken to, he is in a much wor&s;e &s;ituation; he an&s;wers with the utmo&s;t difficulty, and nearly &s;tammers; whereas, a gentleman who is acquainted with life, enters a room with gracefulne&s;s, and a mode&s;t a&s;&s;urance, addre&s;&s;es per&s;ons whom he does not know, in an ea&s;y and natural manner, and with|out the lea&s;t embarra&s;&s;ment. This is the characteri&s;tic of good breeding, a very nece&s;&s;ary knowledge in our intercour&s;e with men; for one of inferior parts, with the behaviour of a gentleman, is frequently better received than a man of &s;en&s;e, with the addre&s;s and manners of a clown.</P>
<P>Ignorance and vice are the only things we need be a&s;hamed of; &s;teer clear of the&s;e, and you may go into any company you will; not that I would have a young man throw off all dread of appearing abroad, as a fear of offending or being di&s;e&s;teemed, will make him pre&s;erve a proper decorum. Some per&s;ons, from experiencing the inconveniencies of fal&s;e mode&s;ty, have run into the other extreme, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> acquired the name of impudent. This is as great a fault as the other. A well-bred man keeps him&s;elf between the two, and &s;teers the middle way. He is ea&s;y and firm in every company, is mode&s;t, but not ba&s;hful, &s;teady, but not impudent. He copies the manners of the better &s;ort of people, and conforms to their cu&s;toms with ea&s;e and attention.</P>
<P>Till we can pre&s;ent our&s;elves in all companies with coolne&s;s and unconcern, we can never pre&s;ent our&s;elves well; nor will a man ever be &s;uppo&s;ed to have kept good company&punc; or ever be acceptable in &s;uch company, if he cannot appear there ea&s;y and unembarra&s;&s;ed. A mode&s;t a&s;&s;urance, in every part of life, is the mo&s;t advantageous qua|lification we can po&s;&s;ibly acquire.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of becoming in&s;olent, a man of &s;en&s;e, under a con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of merit, is more mode&s;t. He behaves him&s;elf indeed with firmne&s;s, but without the lea&s;t pre&s;umption. The man who is igno|rant of his own merit, is no le&s;s a fool, than he who is con&s;tantly di&s;playing it. A man of under&s;tanding avails him&s;elf of his abili|ties, but never boa&s;ts of them; whereas the timid and ba&s;hful can never pu&s;h him&s;elf in life, be his merit as great as it will; he will be always kept behind by the forward and the bu&s;tling. A man of abilities, and acquainted with life, will &s;tand as firm in defence of his own rights, as the mo&s;t impudent man alive; but then he does it with a &s;eeming mode&s;ty. Thus, manner is every thing; what is impudence in one, is proper a&s;&s;urance only in another; for firmne&s;s is commendable, but an overbearing conduct is di&s;gu&s;tful.</P>
<P>Forwardne&s;s being the very rever&s;e of mode&s;ty, follow rather than lead the company: that is, join in di&s;cour&s;e upon &s;ubjects, rather than &s;tart one of your own; if you have parts, you will have oppor|tunities enough of &s;howing them on every topic of conver&s;ation; and if you have none, it is better to expo&s;e your&s;elf upon a &s;ubject of other people's than one of your own.</P>
<P>But, be particularly careful not to &s;peak of your&s;elf, if you can help it. An impudent fellow lugs in him&s;elf abruptly upon all oc|ca&s;ions,
<PB N="3" REF="027039_0006_0FD2F9C5717A61C0">
and is ever the hero of his own &s;tory. Others will colour their arrogance with, "It may &s;eem &s;trange, indeed, that I &s;hould talk in this manner of my&s;elf; it is what I by no means like, and &s;hould never do, if I had not been cruelly and unju&s;tly accu&s;ed; but when my character is attacked; it is a ju&s;tice I owe to my&s;elf to defend it." This veil is too thin not to be &s;een through on the fir&s;t in&s;pection.</P>
<P>Others again, with more art, will <HI>mode&s;tly</HI> boa&s;t of all the princi|pal virtues, by calling the&s;e virtues, weakne&s;&s;es, and &s;aying, they are &s;o unfortunate as to fall into weakne&s;&s;es. "I cannot &s;ee per&s;ons &s;uffer," &s;ays one of this ca&s;t, "without relieving them; though my circum&s;tances are very unable to afford it." "I cannot avoid &s;peak|ing truth, though it is often very imprudent," and &s;o on.</P>
<P>This angling for prai&s;e is &s;o prevailing a principle, that it frequent|ly &s;toops to the lowe&s;t objects. Men will often boa&s;t of doing that, which, if true, would be rather a di&s;grace to them than otherwi&s;e. One man affirms, that he rode twenty miles within the hour; 'tis probably a lie, but &s;uppo&s;e he did, what then? He had a good hor&s;e under him, and is a good jocky. Another &s;wears he has of|ten, at a &s;itting, drank five or &s;ix bottles to his own &s;hare. Out of re&s;pect to him, I will believe him a liar, for I would not wi&s;h to think him a bea&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e and many more are the follies of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> people, which, while they think they procure them e&s;teem, in reality make them de|&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P>To avoid this contempt, therefore, never &s;peak of your&s;elf at all, unle&s;s nece&s;&s;ity obliges you; and even then take care to do it in &s;uch a manner, that it may not be con&s;trued into fi&s;hing for applau&s;e. Whatever perfections you may have, be a&s;&s;ured, people will find them out; but whether they do or not, nobody will take them upon your own word. The le&s;s you &s;ay of your&s;elf, the more the world will give you credit for; and the more you &s;ay, the le&s;s they will be|lieve you.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>LYING.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the vices, there is none more criminal, more mean, and more ridiculous, than lying. The end we de&s;ign by it, is very &s;eldom accompli&s;hed, for lies are always found out, at one time or other; and yet there are per&s;ons who give way to this vice, who are otherwi&s;e of good principles, and have not been ill educated.</P>
<P>Lies generally proceed from vanity, cowardice, and a revenge|ful di&s;po&s;ition, and &s;ometimes from a mi&s;taken notion of &s;elf-de|fence.</P>
<P>He who tells a malicious lie, with a view of injuring the per&s;on he &s;peaks of, may gratify his wi&s;h for a while, but will in the end, find it recoil upon him&s;elf; for as &s;oon as he is detected, (and detect|ed he mo&s;t certainly will be) he is de&s;pi&s;ed for the infamous attempt, and whatever he may &s;ay hereafter of that per&s;on, will be con&s;idered as fal&s;e, whether it be &s;o or not.</P>
<P>If a man lies, &s;huffles or equivocates, for, in fact, they are all
<PB N="4" REF="027039_0007_0FD2F9C7C18ADA08">
alike, by way of excu&s;e for any thing he has &s;aid or done, he aggra|vates the offence, rather than le&s;&s;ens it; for the per&s;on to whom the lie is told, has a right to know the truth, or there &s;hould have been no occa&s;ion to have framed a fal&s;ehood. This per&s;on, of cour&s;e will think him&s;elf ill-treated for being a &s;econd time affronted; for what can be a greater affront than an attempt to impo&s;e upon any man's under&s;tanding? Be&s;ides, lying in excu&s;e for a fault, betrays fear, than which nothing is more da&s;tardly, and unbecoming the charac|ter of a gentleman.</P>
<P>There is nothing more manly, or more noble, if we have done wrong, than frankly to own it. It is the only way of meeting for|givene&s;s. Indeed, confe&s;&s;ing a fault, and a&s;king pardon, with great minds, is con&s;idered as a &s;ufficient attonement. "I have been be|trayed into an error," or, "I have injured you, &s;ir, and am heartily a&s;hamed of it, and &s;orry for it," has frequently di&s;armed the per&s;on injured, and, where he would have been our enemy, has made him our friend.</P>
<P>There are per&s;ons al&s;o, who&s;e <HI>vanity</HI> leads them to tell a thou&s;and lies. They per&s;uade them&s;elves, that, if it be no way injurious to others, it is harmle&s;s and innocent, and they &s;helter their fal&s;ehoods under the &s;ofter name of <HI>untruths.</HI> The&s;e per&s;ons are fooli&s;h enough to imagine, that if they can recite any thing wonderful, they draw the attention of the company, and if they them&s;elves are the objects of that wonder, they are looked up to as per&s;ons extraordinary. This has made many a man &s;ee things that never were in being, hear things that never were &s;aid, and atchieve feats that never were attempt|ed, and dealing always in the marvellous. Such may be a&s;&s;ured, however unwilling the per&s;ons they are conver&s;ing with, may be to laugh in their faces, that they hold them &s;ecretly in the highe&s;t con|tempt; for he who will tell a lie thus idly, will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;cruple to tell a greater where his intere&s;t is concerned. Rather than any per&s;on &s;hould doubt of my veracity for one minute, I would deprive my|&s;elf of telling abroad either what I had really &s;een or heard, if &s;uch things did not carry with them the face of probability.</P>
<P>Others again will boa&s;t of the great re&s;pect they met with in cer|tain companies; of the honours that are continually heaped on them there; of the great price they give for every thing they purcha&s;e, and this is to be thought of con&s;equence; but unle&s;s &s;uch people have the be&s;t and mo&s;t accurate memory, they will, perhaps, very &s;oon after, contradict their former a&s;&s;ertions, and &s;ubject them&s;elves to contempt and deri&s;ion.</P>
<P>Remember then, as long as you live, that nothing but &s;trict truth can carry you through life with honour and credit. Liars are not only di&s;agreeable, but dangerous companions, and, when known, will ever be &s;hunned by men of under&s;tanding. Be&s;ides, as the great|e&s;t liars are generally the greate&s;t fools, a man who addicts him&s;elf to this dete&s;table vice, will not only be looked upon as vulgar, but will never be con&s;idered as a man of &s;en&s;e.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>GOOD-BREEDING.</HEAD>
<P>VOID of good-breeding, every other qualification will be im|perfect, unadorned, and to a certain degree unavailing.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="027039_0008_0FD2F9C973B13EF0">
Good breeding being the re&s;ult of good &s;en&s;e and good nature, is it not wonderful that people po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the one, &s;hould be deficient in the other? The modes of it varying according to per&s;ons, places and circum&s;tances, cannot, indeed, be acquired otherwi&s;e than by time and ob&s;ervation, but the &s;ub&s;tance is every where and always the &s;ame.</P>
<P>What good morals are to &s;ociety in general, good manners are to particular ones; their band and &s;ecurity. Of all actions, next to that of performing a good one, the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of rendering a ci|vility, is the mo&s;t grateful.</P>
<P>We &s;eldom &s;ee a per&s;on, let him be ever &s;o ill-bred, wanting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> re&s;pect to tho&s;e whom he acknowledges to be his &s;uperiors; the man|ner of &s;howing this re&s;pect, then, is all I contend for. The well-bred man expre&s;&s;es it naturally and ea&s;ily, while he who is unu&s;ed to good company expre&s;&s;es it awkwardly. Study, then, to &s;how that re&s;pect which every one wi&s;hes to &s;how, in an ea&s;y and graceful way&punc; but this mu&s;t be learned by ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>In company with our equals, or in mixed companies&punc; a greater lati|tude may be taken in your behaviour; yet it &s;hould never exceed the bounds of decency; for though no one in this ca&s;e, can claim any di&s;tingui&s;hed marks of re&s;pect, every one is entitled to civility and good manners. A man need not, for example, fear to put his hands in his pockets, take &s;nuff, fit, &s;tand, or occa&s;ionally walk about the room; but it would be highly unbecoming to whi&s;tle, wear his hat, loo&s;en his garters, or throw him&s;elf acro&s;s the chairs. Such liberties are offen&s;ive to our equals, and in&s;ulting to our inferi|ors. Ea&s;ine&s;s of carriage, by no means implies inattention and care|le&s;&s;ne&s;s. No one is at liberty to act in all re&s;pects as he plea&s;es; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ut is bound by the laws of good manners, to behave with decorum.</P>
<P>Let a man talk to you ever &s;o &s;tupidly or frivolou&s;ly, not to pay &s;ome attention to what he &s;ays, is &s;avagene&s;s to the greate&s;t degree. Nay, if he even forces his conver&s;ation on you, it is wor&s;e than rude|ne&s;s not to li&s;ten to him; for your inattention in this ca&s;e, tells him in expre&s;s terms, that you think him a blockhead, and not worth the hearing. Now, if &s;uch behaviour is rude to men, it is much more &s;o to women, who be their rank what it will, have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> account of their &s;ex, a claim to officious attention from the men. Their lit|tle wants and whims, their likes and di&s;likes, and even their imperti|nencies, are particularly attended to and flattered, and their very thoughts and wi&s;hes gue&s;&s;ed at and in&s;tantly gratified by every well-bred man.</P>
<P>In promi&s;cuous companies you &s;hould vary your addre&s;s agreeable to the different ages of the per&s;ons you &s;peak to. It would be rude and ab&s;urd to talk of your amours or your plea&s;ures, to men of cer|tain dignity and gravity, to clergymen, or men in years; but &s;till you &s;hould be as ea&s;y with them as with others; your manner only &s;hould be varied; you &s;hould if po&s;&s;ible double your e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|pect and attention to them; and were you to in&s;inuate occa&s;ional|ly, that from their ob&s;ervation and experience you wi&s;h to profit, you would in&s;en&s;ibly win their e&s;teem: for flattery, if not ful&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">me and gro&s;s, is agreeable to all.</P>
<P>When invited to dinner or &s;upper, you mu&s;t never u&s;urp the be&s;t
<PB N="6" REF="027039_0009_0FD2F9CAAA6A1BC8">
places, the be&s;t di&s;hes, &amp;c. but always decline them, and offer them to others, except, indeed, you are offered any thing by a &s;uperior, when it would be a rudene&s;s, if you liked it, not to ac|cept it immediately, without the lea&s;t apology. Thus for exam|ple, was a &s;uperior, the ma&s;ter of the table, to offer you a thing of which there was but one, to pa&s;s it to the per&s;on next you, would be directly charging him that offered it to you, with a want of good manners and proper re&s;pect to his company; or, if you were the only &s;tranger pre&s;ent, it would be a rudene&s;s if you would make a feint of refu&s;ing it, without the cu&s;tomary apo|logy, "I cannot think of taking it from you, &s;ir;" or, "I am &s;orry to deprive you of it;" as it is &s;uppo&s;ed he is con&s;cious of his own rank, and if he cho&s;e not to give it, would not have of|fered it; your apology, therefore, in this ca&s;e, is putting him up|on an equality with your&s;elf. In like manner, it is rudene&s;s to draw back when reque&s;ted by a &s;uperior to pa&s;s a door fir&s;t, or to &s;tep into a carriage before him. In &s;hort, it would be endle&s;s to particulari&s;e all the in&s;tances in which a well-bred man &s;hows his politene&s;s in good company, &s;uch as not yawning, &s;inging, whi&s;t|ling, warming his breech at the fire, lounging, putting his legs upon the chairs, and the like; familiarities, every man's good &s;en&s;e mu&s;t condemn, and good breeding abhor.</P>
<P>But good breeding con&s;i&s;ts in more than merely not being ill-bred. To return a bow, &s;peak when you are &s;poken to, and &s;ay|ing nothing rude, are &s;uch negative acts of good breeding, that they are little more than not being a brute. Would it not be a very poor recommendation of any man's cleanline&s;s, to &s;ay, that, he was not offen&s;ive? If we wi&s;h for the good will and e&s;teem of our acquaintance, our good breeding mu&s;t be active, cheerful, officious and &s;educing.</P>
<P>For example, &s;hould you invite any one to dine or &s;up with you, recollect whether ever you had ob&s;erved them to prefer one thing to another, and endeavour to procure that thing; when at table, &s;ay, "At &s;uch a time, I think, you &s;ecured to give this di&s;h a preference, I therefore ordered it." "This is the wine I ob&s;erved you be&s;t like, I have therefore been at &s;ome pains to procure it." Trifling as the&s;e things may appear, they prove an attention to the per&s;on they are &s;aid to; and as attention in trifles is the te&s;t of re&s;pect, the compliment will not be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>I need only refer you to your own brea&s;t. How have the&s;e little attentions when &s;hown you by others, flattered that &s;elf-love which no man is free from? They incline and attach us to that per&s;on, and prejudice us afterwards to all that he &s;ays or does. The declaration of the women in a great degree, &s;tamps a man's reputation of being either ill or well bred; you mu&s;t then, in a manner overwhelm them with the&s;e attentions; they are u&s;ed to them, and naturally expect them; and to do them ju&s;tice, they are &s;eldom lo&s;t upon them. You mu&s;t be &s;edulous to wait upon them, pick up with alacrity any thing they drop, and be very officious in procuring their carriages or chairs in public places; he blind to what you &s;hould not &s;ee, and deaf to what you &s;hould not hear. Opportunities of &s;howing the&s;e attentions are conti|nually
<PB N="7" REF="027039_0010_0FD2F9CE10741110">
pre&s;enting them&s;elves; but in ca&s;e they &s;hould not, you mu&s;t &s;tudy to create them.</P>
<P>If ever you would be e&s;teemed by the women, your conver&s;a|tion to them &s;hould be always re&s;pectful, lively, and addre&s;&s;ed to their vanity. Every thing you &s;ay or do, &s;hould tend to &s;how a regard to their beauty or good &s;en&s;e: even men are not without their vanities of one kind or other, and flattering that va|nity by words and looks of approbation, is one of the principal characters of good breeding.</P>
<P>Addre&s;s and manners, with weak per&s;ons, who are actually three-fourths of the world, are every thing; and even people of the be&s;t under&s;tanding are taken in with them. Where the heart is not won, and the eye plea&s;ed, the mind will be &s;eldom on our &s;ide.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, learning and erudition, without good breeding, is tire|&s;ome and pedantic; and an ill-bred man is as unfit for good com|pany as he will be unwelcome in it. Nay, he is full as unfit for bu&s;ine&s;s as for company. Make then, good breeding the great object of your thoughts and actions. Be particularly ob&s;ervant of, and endeavour to imitate, the behaviour and manners of &s;uch as are di&s;tingui&s;hed by their politene&s;s; and be per&s;uaded, that good breeding is to all worldly qualifications, what charity is to all chri&s;tian virtues; it adorns merit, and often covers the want of it.</P>

<HEAD>GENTEEL CARRIAGE.</HEAD>
<P>NEXT to good breeding, is a genteel manner and carriage, wholly free from tho&s;e ill habits, and awkward actions which many very worthy per&s;ons are addicted to.</P>
<P>A genteel manner of behaviour, how trifling &s;oever it may &s;eem, is of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence in private life. Men of very inferior parts have been e&s;teemed, merely for their genteel carri|age and good-breeding, while &s;en&s;ible men have given di&s;gu&s;t for want of it. There is &s;omething or other that prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;es us at fir&s;t &s;ight in favour of a well-bred man, and makes us wi&s;h to like him.</P>
<P>When an awkward fellow fir&s;t comes into a room, he attempts to bow, and his &s;word if he wears one, goes between his legs, and nearly throws him down. Confu&s;ed and a&s;hamed, he &s;tum|bles to the upper end of the room, and &s;eats him&s;elf in the very chair he &s;hould not. He there begins playing with his hat, which he pre&s;ently drops; and recovering his hat, he lets fall his cane; and in picking up his cane, down goes his hat again; thus, 'tis a con&s;iderable time before he is adju&s;ted. When his tea or coffee: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> handed to him, he &s;preads his handkerchief upon his knees, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> his mouth, drops either the cup or the &s;aucer, and f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ills the tea or coffee in his lap.</P>
<P>At dinner he is more uncommonly awkward; there he tucks his napkin through a button-hole, which tickles his chin, and oc|ca&s;ions
<PB N="8" REF="027039_0011_0FD2F9D371FD0710">
him to make a variety of wry faces; he &s;eats him&s;elf upon the edge of the chair, at &s;o great a di&s;tance from the table, that he frequently drops his meat between his plate and his mouth; he holds his knife, fork and &s;poon differently from other people; eats with his knife, to the manife&s;t danger of his mouth; picks his teeth with his fork, rakes his mouth with his finger, and puts his &s;poon, which has been in his throat a dozen times, into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> again. If he is to carve, he cannot hit the joint, but in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to cut through the bone, &s;pla&s;hes the &s;auce over every body's cloaths. He generally daubs him&s;elf all over, his elbows are in the next per&s;on's plate, and he is up to the nuckles in &s;oup and grea&s;e. If he drinks, it is with his mouth full, interrupting the whole company with, "To your good health, &s;ir," and, "My &s;ervice to you:" perhaps coughs in his gla&s;s, and be&s;prinkles the whole table. Further, he has perhaps a number of di&s;agreeable tricks, he &s;nuffs up his no&s;e, picks it with his finger, blows it, and looks into his handkerchief, crams his hand into his bo&s;om, and next into his breeches. In &s;hort, he neither dre&s;&s;es nor acts like any other per&s;on, but is particularly awkward in every thing he does. All this, I own, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> nothing in it criminal; but it is &s;uch an offence to good manners and good breeding, that it is uni|ver&s;ally de&s;pi&s;ed; it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a man ridiculous in every company, and of cour&s;e ought carefully to be avoided by every one who would wi&s;h to plea&s;e.</P>
<P>From this picture of the ill-bred man, you will ea&s;ily di&s;cover that of the well-bred; for you may readily judge what you ought to do, when you are told what you ought not to do; a little attention <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> manners of tho&s;e who have &s;een the world, will make a proper behaviour habitual and familiar to you.</P>
<P>Actions, that would otherwi&s;e be plea&s;ing, frequently become ri|diculous by your manner of doing them. If a lady drops her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in company, the wor&s;t bred-man will immediately pick it up and give it to her; the be&s;t-bred-man can do no more; but then he does it in a graceful manner, that is &s;ure to plea&s;e, whereas the other would do it &s;o awkwardly as to be laughed at.</P>

<P>There is al&s;o an awkwardne&s;s in &s;peech, that naturally falls under his head, and ought to, and may be guarded again&s;t; &s;uch as for|geting names, and mi&s;taking one name for mother; to &s;peak of Mr. What-dy'e-call-him, or You know-who, Mrs. Thingum, What's-her-name, or How-dy'e-call-her, is exceeding awkward and vulgar.

<P>Our voice and manner of &s;peaking too, &s;hould likewi&s;e be at|tended to. Some will mumble over their words, &s;o as not to be intelligible, and others will &s;peak &s;o fa&s;t as not to be under&s;tood; and, in doing this, will &s;putter and &s;pit in your face; &s;ome will bawl as if they were &s;peaking to the deaf; others will &s;peak &s;o low as &s;carcely to be heard; and many will put their faces &s;o clo&s;e to yours, as to offend you with their breath. All the&s;e habits are horrid and di&s;gu&s;tful, but may ea&s;ily be got the better of with care. They are the vulgar characteri&s;tics of a low-bred man, or are proofs that very little pains have been be&s;towed in his educa|tion. In &s;hort, an attention to the&s;e little matters are of greater importance than you are aware of; many a &s;en&s;ible man having lo&s;t ground for want of tho&s;e little graces, and many a one po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed of the&s;e perfections alone, has made his way through life, that otherwi&s;e would not have been noticed.</P>

<HEAD>CLEANLINESS OF PERSON.</HEAD>
<P>BUT, as no one can plea&s;e in company, however graceful his air, unle&s;s he be clean and neat in his per&s;on, this quali|fication comes next to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P>Negligence of one's per&s;on not only implies an insufferable in|dolence, but an indifference whether we plea&s;e or not. In others it betrays an in&s;olence and affectation, ari&s;ing from a pre&s;umption that they are &s;ure of plea&s;ing, without having recour&s;e to tho&s;e means which many are obliged to u&s;e.</P>
<P>He who is not thoroughly clean in his per&s;on, will be offen&s;ive to all he conver&s;es with. A particular regard to the cleanline&s;s of your mouth, teeth, hands and nails, is but common decency. A &s;oul mouth, and unclean hands, are certain marks of vulgarity; the fir&s;t is the cau&s;e of an offen&s;ive breath, which nobody can bear, and the la&s;t is declarative of dirty work; one may always know a gentleman by the &s;tate of his hands and nails. The fle&s;h at the roots &s;hould be kept back, &s;o as to &s;how the &s;emi-circles at the bottom of the nails; the edges of the nails &s;hould never he cut down below the ends of the fingers, nor &s;hould they be &s;uffered to grow longer than the fingers. When the nails are cut down to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, it is a &s;hrewd &s;ign that the man is a mechanic, to whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> nails would be trouble&s;ome, or that he gets his bread by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and if they are longer than his fingers ends, and encircled

with a black rim, it foretells he has been laboriou&s;ly and meanly employed, and too fatigued to clean him&s;elf; a good apology for want of cleanline&s;s in a mechanic, but the greate&s;t di&s;grace that can attend a gentleman.</P>
<P>The&s;e things may appear too in&s;ignificant to be mentioned; but when it is con&s;idered that a thou&s;and little namele&s;s things, which every one feels, but no one can de&s;cribe, con&s;pire to form that <HI>whole</HI> of plea&s;ing, I hope you will not call them trifling. Be&s;ides a clean &s;hirt, and a clean per&s;on, are as nece&s;&s;ary to health, as not to offend other people. It is a maxim with me, which I have lived to &s;ee verified, that he who is negligent at twenty years of age, will be a &s;loven at forty, and intolerable at fifty.</P>

<HEAD>DRESS.</HEAD>
<P>NEATNESS of per&s;on, I ob&s;erved, was as nece&s;&s;ary as cleanli|ne&s;s; of cour&s;e &s;ome attention mu&s;t be paid to your dre&s;s.</P>
<P>Such is the ab&s;urdity of the times, that to pa&s;s well with the world, we mu&s;t adopt &s;ome of its cu&s;toms, be they ridiculous or not.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, to neglect one's dre&s;s, is to affront all the female part of our acquaintance. The women in particular pay an attention to their dre&s;s; to neglect therefore your's, will di&s;plea&s;e them, as it would be tacitly taxing them with vani|ty, and declaring that you thought them not worthy that re&s;|pect which every body el&s;e does. And, as I have mentioned before, as it is the women who &s;tamp a young man's credit in the fa&s;hionable world, if you do not make your&s;elf agreeable to the women, you will a&s;&s;uredly lo&s;e ground among the men.</P>
<P>Dre&s;s, as trifling as it may appear to a man of under&s;tand|ing, prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;es on the fir&s;t appearance, which is frequently deci&s;ive. And indeed we may form &s;ome opinion of a man's &s;en&s;e and character from his dre&s;s. Any exceeding of the fa|&s;hion, or any affectation in dre&s;s, whatever, argues a weakne&s;s in under&s;tanding, and nine times out of ten it will be found out &s;o.</P>
<P>There are few young fellows but what di&s;play &s;ome character or other in this &s;hape. Some would be thought fearle&s;s and brave; the&s;e wear a black cravat, a &s;hort coat and wai&s;tcoat, and an uncom|mon long &s;word, hanging to their knees, a large hat fiercely cocked, and are FLASH all over. Others affect to be country &s;quires; the&s;e will go about in buck&s;kin breeches, brown frock, and a great oaken cudgel in their hands, &s;louched hats, with their hair un|dre&s;&s;ed, and tucked up under them to an enormous &s;ize, and imitate grooms, and country boobies &s;o well externally, that there is not the lea&s;t doubt of their re&s;embling them as well internally. Others again, paint and powder them&s;elves &s;o much, and dre&s;s &s;o finically, as leads us to &s;uppo&s;e they are only girls in boys cloaths. Now a &s;en&s;ible man carefully avoids all this, or any other affectation. He dre&s;&s;es as fa&s;hionably and well as per&s;ons of
<PB N="11" REF="027039_0014_0FD2F9DBEDDD0338">
he be&s;t families, and the be&s;t &s;en&s;e; if he exceeds them, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a coxcomb; if he dre&s;&s;es wor&s;e; he is unpardonable.</P>
<P>Dre&s;s your&s;elf fine, then, if po&s;&s;ible, or plain, agreeable to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he company you are in; that is, conform to the dre&s;s of others, and avoid the appearance, of being tumbled. Imitate tho&s;e rea|&s;onable people of your own age, who&s;e dre&s;s is neither remarked is too neglected, or too much &s;tudied. Take care to have your cloaths well made, in the fa&s;hion, and to fit you, or you will, af|ter all, appear awkward. When once dre&s;&s;ed, think no more of it; &s;how no fear of di&s;compo&s;ing your dre&s;s, but let all your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">motions be as ea&s;y and unembarra&s;&s;ed, as if you was at home in your di&s;habille.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>ELEGANCE OF EXPRESSION.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING mentioned elegance of per&s;on, I will proceed to elegance of expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is not one or two qualifications <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> complete the gentle|man; it mu&s;t be a union of many; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> graceful &s;peaking is as e&s;&s;ential as gracefulne&s;s of per&s;on. Every man cannot be an har|monious &s;peaker; a roughne&s;s or coar&s;ene&s;s of voice may prevent it; but if there are no natural imperfections, if a man does not &s;tammer or li&s;p, or has not lo&s;t his teeth, he may &s;peak gracefully, nor will all the&s;e defects, if he has a mind to it, prevent him from &s;peaking correctly.</P>
<P>Nobody can attend with plea&s;ure to a bad &s;peaker. One who tells his &s;tory ill, be it ever &s;o important, will tire even the mo&s;t patient. If you have been pre&s;ent at the performance of a good tragedy, you have doubtle&s;s been &s;en&s;ible of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> effects of a &s;peech well delivered; how much it has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and affected you; and on the contrary, how much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ill-&s;poken one has di&s;|gu&s;ted you. 'Tis the &s;ame in common conver&s;ation; he who &s;peaks deliberately, di&s;tinctly and correctly; he who makes u&s;e of the be&s;t words to expre&s;s him&s;elf, and varies his voice accord|ing to the nature of the &s;ubject, will always plea&s;e; while the thick or ha&s;ty &s;peaker, he who mumbles out a &s;et of ill-cho&s;en words, utters them ungrammatically, or with a dull monotony, will tire and di&s;gu&s;t. Be a&s;&s;ured, then, the air, the ge&s;ture, the looks of a &s;peaker, a proper accent, a ju&s;t empha&s;is, and tuneful cadence, are full as nece&s;&s;ary to plea&s;e and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> attended to, as the &s;ubject matter it&s;elf.</P>
<P>People may talk what they will of &s;olid rea&s;oning and &s;ound &s;en&s;e; without the graces and ornaments of language, they will neither plea&s;e or per&s;uade. In common di&s;cour&s;e, even trifles elegantly expre&s;&s;ed, will be better received than the be&s;t of ar|guments, home&s;pun and unadorned.</P>
<P>A good way to acquire a graceful utterance is, to read aloud to &s;ome friend every day, and beg of him to &s;et you right, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;e you read too fa&s;t, do not ob&s;erve the proper &s;tops, lay a wrong empha&s;is, or utter your words indi&s;tinctly. You may even read
<PB N="12" REF="027039_0015_0FD2F9DD6B427A68">
aloud to your&s;elf, where &s;uch a friend is not at hand, and you will find your own ear a good corrector. Take care to open your teeth when you read or &s;peak, and articulate every word di&s;tinctly, which la&s;t cannot be done, but by &s;ounding the final letter. But above all, endeavour to vary your voice, according to the matter, and avoid a monotony. By a daily attention to this, it will, in a little time, become ea&s;y and habitual to you.</P>
<P>Pay an attention al&s;o to your looks and your ge&s;ture, when talking even on the mo&s;t trifling &s;ubjects; things appear very different, according as they are expre&s;&s;ed, looked and deli|vered.</P>
<P>Now, if it is nece&s;&s;ary to attend &s;o particularly to our <HI>manner</HI> of &s;peaking, it is much more &s;o, with re&s;pect to the <HI>matter.</HI> Fine turns of expre&s;&s;ion, a genteel and correct &s;tyle, are ornaments as requi&s;ite to common &s;en&s;e, as polite behaviour and an elegant ad|dre&s;s are to common good manners: they are great a&s;&s;i&s;tants in the point of plea&s;ing. A gentleman, 'tis true, may be known in the meane&s;t garb, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> admits not of a doubt, that he would be better received into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> company, genteelly and fa&s;hionably dre&s;&s;ed, than was he to appear in dirt and letters.</P>
<P>Be careful then of your &s;tyle upon all occa&s;ions; whether you write or &s;peak, &s;tudy for the be&s;t words and be&s;t expre&s;&s;ions, even in common conver&s;ation, or the mo&s;t familiar letters. This will prevent your &s;peaking in a hurry, than which nothing is more vulgar; though you may be a little embarra&s;&s;ed at fir&s;t, time and u&s;e will render it ea&s;y. It is no &s;uch difficult thing to expre&s;s our&s;elves well on &s;ubjects we are thoroughly acquainted with, if we think before we &s;peak, and no one &s;hould pre&s;ume to do otherwi&s;e. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> you have &s;aid a thing, con&s;ider deliberately with your&s;elf, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> you could not have expre&s;&s;ed your&s;elf bet|ter: and if you are in doubt of the propriety or elegancy of any word, &s;earch for it in &s;ome dictionary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. John&s;on's folio Dictionary <HI>you will find very &s;erviceable, and</HI> the difference between words reputed &s;ynonymous; <HI>a work in two volumes, written by me &s;ome years ago, and publi&s;hed by Dod&s;ley.</HI></NOTE>, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ome good author while you remember it; never be &s;paring of your trouble, while you wi&s;h to improve, and my word for it, a very little time will make this matter habitual.</P>
<P>In order to &s;peak grammatically and to expre&s;s your&s;elf plea|&s;ingly, I would recommend it to you to tran&s;late often any lan|guage you are acquainted with into Engli&s;h, and to correct &s;uch tran&s;lation, until the words, their order, and the periods, are agreeable to your own ear.</P>
<P>Vulgari&s;m in language is another di&s;tingui&s;hed mark of bad company and education. Expre&s;&s;ions may be correct in them|&s;elves, and yet be vulgar, owing to their not being fa&s;hionable; for language as manners are both e&s;tabli&s;hed by the u&s;age of people of fa&s;hion.</P>

<HEAD>ADDRESS, PHRASEOLOGY AND SMALL-TALK.</HEAD>
<P>IN all good company, we meet with a certain manner, phra&s;eo|logy and general conver&s;ation, that di&s;tingui&s;hes the man of fa&s;hion. This can only be acquired by frequenting good company and being particularly attentive to all that pa&s;&s;es there.</P>
<P>When invited to dine or &s;up at the hou&s;e of any well-bred man, ob&s;erve how he does the honours of his table, and mark his man|ner of treating his company.</P>
<P>Attend to the compliments of congratulation or condolence that he pays; and take notice of his addre&s;s to his &s;uperiors, his equals and his inferiors; nay his very looks and tone of voice are worth your attention, for we cannot plea&s;e without an union of them all.</P>
<P>There is a certain di&s;tingui&s;hing diction that marks the man of fa&s;hion, a certain language of conver&s;ation that every gentleman &s;hould be ma&s;ter of. Saying to a man ju&s;t married, "I wi&s;h you joy," or to one who had lo&s;t his wife, "I am &s;orry for your lo&s;s," and both perhaps with an unbecoming countenance, may be civil, but it is neverthele&s;s vulgar. A man of fa&s;hion will expre&s;s the &s;ame thing more elegantly, and with a look of &s;incerity, that, &s;hall attract the e&s;teem of the per&s;on he &s;peaks to. He will ad|vance to the one with warmth and cheerfulne&s;s, and perhaps &s;queezing him by the hand, will &s;ay, "Believe me, my dear &s;ir, I have &s;carce words to expre&s;s the joy I feel, upon your happy al|liance with &s;uch and &s;uch a family, &amp;c." to the other in affliction he will advance flower, and with a peculiar compo&s;ure of voice and countenance, begin his compliments of condolence with, "I hope &s;ir, you will do me the ju&s;tice to be per&s;uaded, that I am not in&s;en&s;ible of your unhappine&s;s, that I take part in your di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;hall ever be affected where <HI>you</HI> are &s;o."</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="027039_0017_0FD2F9E150FEA1B8">
Your fir&s;t addre&s;s to, and indeed all your conver&s;ation with, your &s;uperiors, &s;hould be open, cheerful and re&s;pectful; with your equals, warm and animated; with your inferiors, hearty, free and unre&s;erved.</P>
<P>There is a fa&s;hionable kind of &s;mall-talk, which however tri|fling it may be thought, has its u&s;e in mixed companies: of cour&s;e you &s;hould endeavour to acquire it. By &s;mall-talk I mean, a good deal to &s;ay on unimportant matters: for example, foods, the flavour and growth of wine, and the chit-chat of the day. Such conver&s;ation will &s;erve to keep off &s;erious &s;ubjects that might create di&s;putes. This chit-chat is chiefly learned by frequenting the company of the ladies.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>AS the art of plea&s;ing is to be learnt only by frequenting the be&s;t companies, we mu&s;t endeavour to pick it up in &s;uch companies by ob&s;ervation; for it is not &s;en&s;e and knowledge alone that will acquire e&s;teem; th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e certainly are the fir&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary foundations for plea&s;ing, but they will by no means do, unle&s;s attended with manners and attentions.</P>
<P>There have been people who have frequented the fir&s;t companies all their life-time, and yet have never got rid of their natural &s;tiff|ne&s;s and awkwardne&s;s; but have continued as vulgar as if they never were out of a &s;ervant's hall: this has been owing to care|le&s;&s;ne&s;s, and a want of attention to the manners and behaviour of others.</P>
<P>There are a great many people likewi&s;e, who bu&s;y them&s;elves the whole day, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> who in fact do nothing. They have po&s;&s;ibly taken up a boo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> two or three hours, but from a certain in at|tention that grows upon them the more it is indulged, know no more of the contents, than if they had not looked into it: nay, it is impo&s;&s;ible for any one to retain what he reads, unle&s;s he re|flects and rea&s;ons upon it as he goes on. When they have thus lounged away an hour or two, they will &s;aunter into company, without attending to any thing that pa&s;&s;es there, but if they think at all, are thinking of &s;ome trifling matter, that ought not to oc|cupy their attention; thence perhaps, they go to the play, where they &s;tare at the company and lights, without attending to the piece, the very thing they went to &s;ee. In this manner they wear away their hours, that might otherwi&s;e be employed to their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">provement and advantage. This &s;illy &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of thought they would pa&s;s for <HI>ab&s;ence of mind</HI>&mdash;ridiculous!&mdash;Wherever you are, let me recommend it to you to pay an attention to all that pa&s;&s;es; ob&s;erve the characters of the per&s;ons you are with, and the &s;ubjects of their conver&s;ation; li&s;ten to every thing that is &s;aid, &s;ee every thing that is done, and (according to the vul|gar &s;aying) have your eyes and your ears about you.</P>
<P>A continual inattention to matters that occur, is the character|i&s;tic of a weak mind; the man who gives way to it, is little le&s;s than a trifler, a blank in &s;ociety, which every &s;en&s;ible per&s;on over|looks;
<PB N="15" REF="027039_0018_0FD2F9E2ADEFAC90">
&s;urely what is worth doing, is worth doing well, and no|thing can be well done, if not properly attended to. When I hear a man &s;ay, upon being a&s;ked about any thing that was &s;aid or done in his pre&s;ence, "that truly he did not mind it." I am ready to knock the fool down, <HI>Why</HI> did he not mind it?&mdash;What had he el&s;e to do?&mdash;A man of &s;en&s;e and fa&s;hion never makes u&s;e of this paltry plea, he never complains of a treacherous memory, but at|tends to and remembers every thing that is either &s;aid or done.</P>
<P>Whenever then you go into good company, that is the company of people of fa&s;hion, ob&s;erve carefully their behaviour, their ad|dre&s;s, and their manner; imitate it as far as in your power. Your attention, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;hould be &s;o ready as to ob&s;erve every per&s;on in the room at once, their motions, their looks and their turns of expre&s;&s;ion, and that without &s;taring, or &s;eeming to be an ob&s;erver. This kind of ob&s;ervation may be acquired by care and practice, and will be found of the utmo&s;t advantage to you in the cour&s;e of life.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>ABSENCE OF MIND.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING mentioned ab&s;ence of mind, let me be more par|ticular concerning it.</P>
<P>What the world calls an ab&s;ent man is, generally either a very affected one, or a very weak one; but whether weak or affected, he is, in company, a very di&s;agreeable man. Lo&s;t in thought, or po&s;&s;ibly in no thought at all, he is a &s;tranger to every one pre|&s;ent, and to every thing that pa&s;&s;es; he knows not his be&s;t friends, is deficient in every act of good manners, unob&s;ervant of the actions of the company, and in&s;en&s;ible of his own. His <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> are quite the rever&s;e of what they ought to be; talk to him of one thing, and he replies as of another. He forgets what he &s;aid la&s;t, leaves his hat in one room, his cane in another, and his &s;word in a third; nay if it was not for his buckles, he would even leave his &s;hoes behind him. Neither his arms <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> his legs &s;eem to be a part of his body, and his head is never in a right po&s;ition. He joins not in the general conver&s;ation, except by fits and &s;tarts, as if awaking from a dream; I attribute this either to weakne&s;s or affectation. His &s;hallow mind is po&s;&s;ibly not able to attend to more than one thing at a time; or he would be &s;uppo&s;ed wrapt up in the inve&s;tigation of &s;ome very important matter. Such men as Sir I&s;aac Newton or Mr. Locke, might occa&s;ionally, have &s;ome excu&s;e for ab&s;ence of mind; it might proceed from that inten&s;ene&s;s of thought that was nece&s;&s;ary at all times for the &s;cientific &s;ubjects they were &s;tudying; but for a young man, and a man of the world, who has no &s;uch plea to make, ab&s;ence of mind is a rudene&s;s to the company, and de&s;erves the &s;evere&s;t cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>However in&s;ignificant a company may be; however trifling their conver&s;ation; while you are with them, do not &s;how them by an in|attention, that you think them trifling; that can never be the way to plea&s;e; but rather fall in with their weakne&s;s than otherwi&s;e; for, to mortify, or &s;how the lea&s;t contempt to tho&s;e we are in company with, is the greate&s;t rudene&s;s we can be guilty of, and what few can forgive.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="027039_0019_0FD2F9E9C501BD00">
I never yet found a man inattentive to the per&s;on he feared, or the woman he loved; which convinces me, that ab&s;ence of mind is to be got the better of, if we think proper to make the trial; and believe me it is always worth the attempt.</P>
<P>Ab&s;ence of mind is a tacit declaration, that tho&s;e we are in com|pany with, are not worth attending to; and what can be a greater af|front?&mdash;Be&s;ides, can an ab&s;ent man improve by what is &s;aid or done in his pre&s;ence?&mdash;No; he may frequent the be&s;t companies for years together, and all to no purpo&s;e. In &s;hort, a man is neither fit for bu|&s;ine&s;s or conver&s;ation, unle&s;s he can attend to the object before him, be that object what it will.</P>

<HEAD>KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD.</HEAD>
<P>A KNOWLEDGE of the world by your own experience and ob&s;ervation is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, that without it we &s;hall act very ab&s;urdly, and frequently give offence, when we do not mean it. All the learning and parts in the world will not &s;ecure us from it. With|out an acquaintance with life, a man may &s;ay very good things, but time them &s;o ill, and addre&s;s them &s;o improperly, that he had much better be &s;ilent. Full of him&s;elf and his own bu&s;ine&s;s, and inattentive to the circum&s;tances and &s;ituations of tho&s;e he conver&s;es with, he vents them without the lea&s;t di&s;cretion, &s;ays things that he ought not to &s;ay, confu&s;es &s;ome, &s;hocks others, and puts the whole company in pain, le&s;t what he utters next &s;hould prove wor&s;e than the la&s;t. The be&s;t direction I can give you in this matter, is rather to fall in with the conver&s;ation of others, than &s;tart a &s;ubject of your own; rather &s;trive to put them more in conceit with them&s;elves, than draw their attention to you.</P>
<P>A novice in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> who knows little of mankind, but what he col|lects from books, lays it down as a maxim, that mo&s;t men love flat|tery; in order therefore to plea&s;e, he will flatter. But how? With|out regard either to circum&s;tances or occa&s;ion. In&s;tead of tho&s;e deli|cate touches, tho&s;e &s;oft tints, that &s;erve to heighten the piece, he lays on his colours with a heavy hand, and daubs where he means to adorn; in other words, he will flatter &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and at the &s;ame time &s;o gro&s;sly, that while he wi&s;hes to plea&s;e, he puts out of countenance, and is &s;ure to offend. On the contrary, a man of the world, one who has made life his &s;tudy, knows the power of flattery as well as he; but then he knows how to apply it, he watches the opportunity, and does it indirectly, by inference, compari&s;on and hint.</P>
<P>Man is made up of &s;uch a variety of matter, that to &s;earch him thoroughly, requires time and attention; for though we are all made of the &s;ame materials, and have all the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions, yet from a dif|ference in their proportion and combination, we vary in our di&s;po&s;i|tions; what is agreeable to one is di&s;agreeable to another, and what one &s;hall approve another &s;hall condemn. Rea&s;on is given us to con|troul the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, but &s;eldom does it. Application therefore to the rea&s;on of any man, will frequently prove ineffectual, unle&s;s we en|deavour at the &s;ame time to gain his heart.</P>
<P>Wherever then you are, &s;earch into the characters of men; find out,
<PB N="17" REF="027039_0020_0FD2F9EBE41B60B0">
if po&s;&s;ible, their foible, their governing pa&s;&s;ion, or their particular merit; take them on their weak &s;ide, and you will generally &s;ucceed; their prevailing vanity you may readily di&s;cover, by ob&s;erving their favourite topic of conver&s;ation, for every one talks mo&s;t of what he would be thought mo&s;t to excel in.</P>
<P>The time &s;hould al&s;o be judiciou&s;ly made choice of. Every man has his particular time, when he may be applied to with &s;ucce&s;s, the <HI>mollia tempora fandi;</HI> but the&s;e times are not all day long; they mu&s;t be found out, watched, and taken advantage of. You could not hope for &s;ucce&s;s in applying to a man about one bu&s;ine&s;s, when he was taken up with another, or when his mind was affected with exce&s;s of grief, anger, or the like.</P>
<P>You cannot judge of other mens minds better than by &s;tudying your own; for though &s;ome men have one foible, and another has another, yet men in general are very much alike. Whatever plea&s;es or offends you, will in &s;imilar circum&s;tances, plea&s;e or offend others; if you find your&s;elf hurt when another makes you feel his &s;uperiority, you will certainly, upon the common rule of right, <HI>do as you would be done by,</HI> take care not to let another feel <HI>your</HI> &s;uperiority, if you have it; e&s;pecially if you wi&s;h to gain his intere&s;t or e&s;teem. If di&s;agree|able in&s;inuations, open contradictions or oblique &s;neers vex and anger you, would you u&s;e them where you wi&s;hed to plea&s;e? Certainly not. Ob&s;erve then, with care the operations of your own mind, and you may in a great mea&s;ure read all mankind.</P>
<P>I will allow that one bred up in a cloy&s;ter or college may rea&s;on well on the &s;tructure of the human mind; he may inve&s;tigate the na|ture of man, and give a tolerable account of his head, his heart, his pa&s;&s;ions, and his &s;entiments: but at the &s;ame time he may know no|thing of him; he has not lived with him, and of cour&s;e can know but little how tho&s;e &s;entiments or tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions will work&mdash;He mu&s;t be ignorant of the various&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rejudices, propen&s;ities and antipa|thies that always bias him, and frequently determine him. His knowledge is acquired only from theory, which differs widely from practice; and if he forms his judgment from that alone, he mu&s;t be often deceived; whereas a man of the world, one who collects his knowledge from his own experience and ob&s;ervation, is &s;eldom wrong; he is well acquainted with the operations of the human mind, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> into the heart of man; reads his words before they are uttered; &s;ees his actions before they are performed; knows what will plea&s;e, and what will di&s;plea&s;e, and fore&s;ees the event of mo&s;t things.</P>
<P>Labour then to acquire this intuitive knowledge; attend carefully to the addre&s;s, the arts and manners of tho&s;e acquainted with life, and endeavour to imitate them. Ob&s;erve the means they take to gain the favour and conciliate the affections of tho&s;e they a&s;&s;ociate with; pur&s;ue tho&s;e means, and you will &s;oon gain the e&s;teem of all that know you.</P>
<P>How often have we &s;een men governed by per&s;ons very much their inferiors in point of under&s;tanding, and even without their knowing it? A proof that &s;ome men have more worldly dexterity than others; they find out the weak and unguarded part, make their attack there, and the man &s;urrenders.</P>
<P>Now from a knowledge of mankind, we &s;hall learn the advantage of two things, the command of our temper and our countenances;
<PB N="18" REF="027039_0021_0FD2F9ED4AC5FAF8">
a trifling di&s;agreeable incident &s;hall perhaps anger one unacquainted with life, or confound him with &s;hame; &s;hall make him rave like a mad-man, or look like a fool; but a man of the world will never under&s;tand what he cannot or ought not to re&s;ent. If he &s;hould chance to make a &s;hip him&s;elf, he will &s;tifle his confu&s;ion, and turn it off with a je&s;t, recovering it with coolne&s;s.</P>
<P>Many people have &s;en&s;e enough to keep their own &s;ecrets, but from being unu&s;ed to a variety of company, have unfortunately &s;uch a tell-tale countenance, as involuntarily declares what they would wi&s;h to conceal. This is a great unhappine&s;s, and &s;hould, as &s;oon as po&s;|&s;ible be got the better of.</P>
<P>That coolne&s;s of mind, and evenne&s;s of countenance, which pre|vents a di&s;covery of our &s;entiments <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> our words, our actions, or our looks, is too nece&s;&s;ary to pa&s;s unnoticed. A man who cannot hear di&s;plea&s;ing things without vi&s;ible marks of anger or unea&s;ine&s;s, or plea&s;ing ones, without a &s;udden bur&s;t of joy, a cheerful eye, or an expanded face, is a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the mercy of every knave, for either they will de&s;ignedly plea&s;e or provoke you them&s;elves, to catch your unguarded looks; or they will &s;eize the opportunity, thus to read your very heart, when any other &s;hall do it. You may po&s;&s;ibly tell me that this coolne&s;s mu&s;t be natural, for if not, you can never acquire it. I will admit the force of con&s;titution, but people are very apt to blame for many things they might readily avoid. Care with a little reflexion will &s;oon give you this ma&s;tery of your temper and your countenance. If you find your&s;elf &s;ubject to &s;udden &s;tarts of pa&s;&s;ion, determine with your&s;elf not to utter a &s;ingle word till your rea&s;on has recovered it&s;elf; and re&s;olve to keep your countenance as unmoved as po&s;&s;ible. As a man, who at a card table, can pre&s;erve a &s;erenity in his looks under good or bad luck, has con&s;iderably the advantage of one who appears elated with &s;ucce&s;s, or ca&s;t down with ill fortune, from our being able to read his cards in his face, &s;o the man of the world, having to deal with one of the&s;e babbling countenances, will take care to profit by the circum&s;tance, let the con&s;equence, to him with whom he deals, be as injurious as it may.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of life; we &s;hall find it nece&s;&s;ary very often to put on a plea&s;ing countenance when we are exceedingly di&s;plea&s;ed; we mu&s;t frequently &s;eem friendly when we are quite otherwi&s;e. I am &s;en&s;ible it is difficult to acco&s;t a man with &s;miles whom we know to be our enemy: but what is to be done? On receiving an affront, if you cannot be ju&s;tified in knocking the offender down, you mu&s;t not notice the offence; for, in the eye of the world, taking an affront calmly is con&s;idered as cowardice,</P>
<P>If fools &s;hould attempt at any time to be witty upon you, the be&s;t way is not to know their wittici&s;ms are levelled at you, but to con|ceal any unea&s;ine&s;s it may give you: but &s;hould they be &s;o plain that you cannot be thought ignorant of their meaning, I would recommend, rather than quarrel with the company, joining even in the laugh again&s;t your&s;elf; allow the je&s;t to be a good one, and take it in &s;eeming good humour. Never attempt to retaliate the &s;ame way, as that would imply you were hurt. Should what is &s;aid wound your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> or your moral character, there is but one proper reply, which I hope you will never be obliged to have recour&s;e to.</P>
<P>Remember there are but two alternatives for a gentleman; extreme
<PB N="19" REF="027039_0022_0FD2F9EEBB25B170">
politene&s;s, or the &s;word. If a man openly and de&s;ignedly affronts you, call him out; but if it does not amount to an open in&s;ult, be outwardly civil; if this does not make him a&s;hamed of his be|haviour, it will prejudice every by-&s;tander in your favour, and in|&s;tead of being di&s;graced, you will come off with honour. Politene&s;s to tho&s;e you do not re&s;pect, is no more a breach of faith, than <HI>your humble &s;ervant</HI> at the bottom of a challenge; they are univer&s;ally un|der&s;tood to be things of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Wrangling and quarreling are characteri&s;tic of a weak mind; leave that to the women, be <HI>you</HI> always above it. Enter into no &s;harp conte&s;t, and pride your&s;elf, in &s;howing, if po&s;&s;ible, more civility to your antagoni&s;t than to any other in company; this will infallibly bring over all the laughers to your &s;ide, and the per&s;ons you are con|tending with, will be very likely to confe&s;s you have behaved very hand&s;omely throughout the whole affair.</P>
<P>Experience will teach us, that though all men con&s;i&s;t principally of the &s;ame materials, as I before took notice, yet for a difference in their proportion, no two men are uniformly the &s;ame: we differ from one another, and we often differ from our&s;elves, that is, we &s;ome|times do things utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with the general tenor of our cha|racters. The wi&s;e&s;t man will occa&s;ionally do a weak thing; the mo&s;t hone&s;t man a wrong thing; the proude&s;t man a mean thing; and the wor&s;t of men will &s;ometimes do a good thing. On this account, our &s;tudy of mankind &s;hould not be general: we &s;hould take a fre|quent view of individuals, and though we may upon the whole form a judgment of the man from his prevailing pa&s;&s;ion or his gene|ral character, yet it will be prudent not to determine, till we have waited to &s;ee the operations of his &s;ubordinate appetites and hu|mours.</P>
<P>For example: a man's general character may be that of &s;trictly hone&s;t; I would not di&s;pute it, becau&s;e, I would not be thought envious or malevolent; but I would not rely upon this general cha|racter, &s;o as to entru&s;t him with my fortune or my life. Should this hone&s;t man, as is not uncommon, be my rival in power, inter|e&s;t, or love, he may po&s;&s;ibly do things, that in other circum&s;tances he would abhor: and power, intere&s;t and love, let me tell you, will often put hone&s;ty to the &s;evere&s;t trial, and frequently overpower it. I would then ran&s;ack this hone&s;t man to the bottom, if I wi&s;h|ed to tru&s;t him, and as I found him, would place my confidence accordingly.</P>
<P>One of the great compo&s;itions in our nature is vanity, to which all men more or le&s;s give way.</P>
<P>Women have an intolerable &s;hare of it. No flattery, no adula|tion is too gro&s;s for them; tho&s;e who flatter them mo&s;t plea&s;e them be&s;t, and they are mo&s;t in love with them: and the lea&s;t &s;light or contempt of them is never forgotten. It is in &s;ome mea&s;ure the &s;ame with men; they will &s;ooner pardon an injury than an in&s;ult, and are more hurt by contempt than by ill u&s;age. Though all men do not boa&s;t of &s;uperior talents, though they pretend not to the abilities of a Pope, a Newton, or a Bolingbroke, every one who pretends to have common &s;en&s;e, and to di&s;charge his office in life with com|mon decency; to arraign therefore, in any &s;hape his abilities or in|tegrity
<PB N="20" REF="027039_0023_0FD2F9F032F7B2F0">
in the department he holds, is an in&s;ult he will not readily forgive.</P>
<P>As I would not have you tru&s;t too implicitly to a man, becau&s;e the world gives him a good character; &s;o I mu&s;t particularly caution you again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;peak well of them&s;elves. In general &s;u&s;pect tho&s;e who boa&s;t of, or affect to have any one virtue above all others, for they are commonly impo&s;tors. There are exceptions however to this rule, for we hear of prudes that have been cha&s;te, bullies that have been brave, and &s;aints that have been religious. Confide only where your own ob&s;ervation &s;hall direct you; ob&s;erve not only what is &s;aid, but how it is &s;aid, and if you have any penetration, you may find out the truth better by your eyes than your ears; in &s;hort, never take a character upon common report, but enquire into it your&s;elf; for common report, though it is right in general, may be wrong in particulars.</P>
<P>Beware of tho&s;e who on a &s;hort acquaintance, make you a tender of their friend&s;hip, and &s;eem to place a confidence in you; 'tis ten to one but they deceive and betray you; however, do not rudely re|ject them upon &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition: you may be civil to them, though you do not entru&s;t them. Silly men are apt to &s;olicit your friend|&s;hip and unbo&s;om them&s;elves upon the fir&s;t acquaintance; &s;uch a friend cannot be worth hearing, their friend&s;hip being as &s;lender as their under&s;tanding; and if they proffer their friend&s;hip with a de|&s;ign to make a property of you, they are dangerous acquaintance in|deed. Not but the little friend&s;hips of the weak may be of &s;ome u&s;e to you, if you do not return the compliment; and it may not be ami&s;s to &s;eem to accept tho&s;e of de&s;igning men, keeping them, as it were, in play, that they may not be openly your enemies; for their enmity is the next dangerous thing to their friend&s;hip. We may cer|tainly hold their vices in abhorrence, without being marked out as their per&s;onal enemy. The general rule is to have a real re&s;erve with almo&s;t every one, and a &s;eeming re&s;erve with almo&s;t no one: for it is very di&s;gu&s;ting to &s;eem re&s;erved, and very dangerous not to be &s;o. Few ob&s;erve the true medium. Many are ridiculou&s;ly my&s;|terious upon trifles, and many indi&s;creetly communicative of all they know.</P>
<P>There is a kind of &s;hort-lived friend&s;hip that takes place among young men, from a connexion in their plea&s;ures only; a friend&s;hip too often attended with bad con&s;equences. This companion of your plea&s;ures, young and unexperienced, will probably in the heat of convivial mirth, vow a perpetual friend&s;hip, and unfold him&s;elf to you without the lea&s;t re&s;erve: but new a&s;&s;ociations, change of for|tune, or change of place, may &s;oon break this ill-timed connexion and an improper u&s;e may be made of it. Be one if you will, in young companies, and bear your part like others in all the &s;ocial fe&s;tivity of youth; nay, tru&s;t them with your innocent frolics, but keep your &s;erious matters to your&s;elf; and if you mu&s;t at any time make <HI>them</HI> known, let it be to &s;ome tried friend of great experience; and that nothing may tempt him to become your rival, let that friend be in a different walk of life from your&s;elf.</P>
<P>Were I to hear a man making &s;trong prote&s;tations and &s;wearing to the truth of the thing that is in it&s;elf probable, and very likely to
<PB N="21" REF="027039_0024_0FD2F9F1B3D83398">
be, I &s;hould doubt his veracity; for when he takes &s;uch pains to make me believe it, it cannot be a good de&s;ign.</P>
<P>There is a certain ea&s;ine&s;s or fal&s;e mode&s;ty in mo&s;t young people, that either makes them unwilling, or a&s;hamed to refu&s;e any thing that is a&s;ked of them. There is al&s;o an unguarded openne&s;s about them, that makes them the ready prey of the artful and de&s;igning. They are ea&s;ily led away by the feigned friend&s;hips of a knave or a fool, and too ra&s;hly place a confidence in them, that terminates in their lo&s;s, and frequently in their ruin. Beware therefore, as I &s;aid before, of the&s;e proffered friend&s;hips; repay them with compliments, but not with confidence. Never let your vanity make you &s;uppo&s;e, that people become your friends on a &s;light acquaintance; for good offices mu&s;t be &s;hown upon both &s;ides to create a friend&s;hip: it will not thrive unle&s;s its love be mutual; and it requires time to ripen it.</P>
<P>There is &s;till among young people another kind of friend&s;hip, merely nominal, warm indeed for the time, but fortunately of no long continuance. This friend&s;hip takes it ri&s;e from their pur&s;uing the &s;ame cour&s;e of riot and debauchery; their pur&s;es are open to each other, they tell one another all they know; they embark in the &s;ame quarrels, and &s;tand by each other on all occa&s;ions. I &s;hould rather call this a confederacy again&s;t good morals and good manners, and think it de&s;erves the &s;evere&s;t la&s;h of the law<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> but, they have the impudence to call it friend&s;hip. However, it is often as &s;uddenly di&s;|&s;olved as it is ha&s;tily contracted; &s;ome accident di&s;per&s;es them, and they pre&s;ently forget each other, except it be to betray and to laugh at their own egregious folly.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the &s;um of the whole is, to make a wide difference be|tween companies and friends, for a very agreeable companion has often proved a very dangerous friend.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHOICE OF COMPANY.</HEAD>
<P>THE next thing to the choice of your friends is the choice of your company.</P>
<P>Endeavour as much as you can to keep good company, and the company of your &s;uperiors; for you will be held in e&s;timation ac|cording to what company you keep. By &s;uperiors, I do not mean &s;o much with regard to birth, as merit, and the light in which they are con&s;idered in the world.</P>
<P>There are two &s;orts of good company, the one con&s;i&s;ts of per&s;ons of birth, rank and fa&s;hion; the other, of tho&s;e who are di&s;tingui&s;h|ed by &s;ome peculiar merit, in any liberal art or &s;cience; as men of letters, &amp;c. and a mixture of the&s;e is what I would have under&s;tood by good company; for it is not what particular &s;ets of people in gene|ral acknowledge to be &s;o, and are the accredited good company of the place.</P>
<P>Now and then, per&s;ons without either birth, rank or character, will creep into good company, under the protection of &s;ome con&s;i|derable per&s;onage; but, in general, none are admitted of mean de|gree, or infamous immoral character.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="027039_0025_0FD2F9F43AC2E090">
In this fa&s;hionable good company alone, can you learn the be&s;t manners and the be&s;t language: for, as there is no legal &s;tandard to form them by, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> here they are e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>It may po&s;&s;ibly be que&s;tioned, whether a man has it always in his power to get into good company: undoubtedly, by de&s;erving it he has; provided he is in circum&s;tances which enable him to live and appear in the &s;tyle of a gentleman. Knowledge, mode&s;ty and good breeding, will endear him to all that &s;ee him; for with|out politene&s;s, the &s;cholar is no better than a pedant, the philo&s;o|pher than a cynic, the &s;oldier than a brute, nor any man than a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">own.</P>
<P>Though the company of men of learning and genius is highly to be valued and occa&s;ionally coveted, I would by no means have you always found in &s;uch company. As they do not live in the world, they cannot have that ea&s;y manner of addre&s;s which I would wi&s;h you to acquire. If you can bear a part in &s;uch company, it is cer|tainly advi&s;eable to be in it &s;ometimes, and you will be the more e&s;|teemed in other company by being &s;o: but let it not engro&s;s you, le&s;t you &s;hould be con&s;idered as one of the <HI>literati,</HI> which however re&s;pectable in name, is not the way to ri&s;e or &s;hine in the fa&s;hiona|ble world.</P>
<P>But the company which, of all others, you &s;hould carefully avoid, is that, which, in every &s;en&s;e of the word may be called <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ow;</HI> low in birth, low in rank, low in parts, and low in manners; that com|pany, who, in&s;ignificant and contemptible in them&s;elves, think is an honour to be &s;een with <HI>you,</HI> and who will flatter your follies, nay your very vices to keep you with them</P>
<P>Though <HI>you</HI> may think &s;uch a caution unnece&s;&s;ary, <HI>I</HI> do not; for many a young gentleman of &s;en&s;e and rank, has been led by his va|nity to keep &s;uch company, till he has been degraded, villified and undone.</P>
<P>The vanity I mean, is that of being the fir&s;t of the company. This pride, though too common, is idle to the la&s;t degree. Nothing in the world lets a man down &s;o much. For the &s;ake of dictating, being applauded and admired by this low company, he is di&s;graced and di&s;qualified for better. Depend upon it, in the e&s;timation of mankind, you will &s;ink or ri&s;e to the level of the company you keep.</P>
<P>Be it, then, your ambition to get into the be&s;t company; and, when there, imitate their virtues, but not their vices. You have no doubt, often heard of genteel and fa&s;hionable vices. The&s;e are whoreing, drinking and gaming. It has happened that &s;ome men, even with the&s;e vices, have been admired and e&s;teemed. Under&s;tand this mat|ter rightly, it is not their vices for which they are admired; but for &s;ome accompli&s;hments they at the &s;ame time po&s;&s;e&s;s; for their parts, their learning or their good-breeding. Be a&s;&s;ured, were they free from their vices, they would be much more e&s;teemed. In the&s;e mixed characters, the bad part is over-looked for the &s;ake of the good.</P>
<P>Should you be unfortunate enough to have any vices of your own, add not to their number by adopting the vices of others. Vices of adoption are of all others the mo&s;t unpardonable, for they have not
<PB N="23" REF="027039_0026_0FD2F9F5B6F853A0">

<P>Imitate, then, only the perfections you meet with; copy the po|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">tene&s;s, the addre&s;s, the ea&s;y manner of well-bred people; and re|member, let them &s;hine ever &s;o bright, if they have any vices, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">re &s;o many blemi&s;hes, which it would be as ridiculous to imitate, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> would to make an artificial wart upon one's face, becau&s;e &s;ome very hand&s;ome man had the misfortune to have a natural one upon his.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>LAUGHTER.</HEAD>
<P>LET us now de&s;cend to minute matters, which though not &s;o important as tho&s;e we have mentioned, are far from incon&s;ider|able. Of the&s;e, laughter is one.</P>
<P>Frequent and loud laughter is a &s;ure &s;ign of a weak mind, and no le&s;s characteri&s;tic of a low education. It is the manner in which low-bred men expre&s;s their &s;illy joy, at &s;illy things, and they call it being merry.</P>
<P>I do not recommend upon all occa&s;ions a &s;olemn countenance. A man may &s;mile, but if he would be thought a gentleman and a man of &s;en&s;e, he would by no means laugh. True wit never made a man of fa&s;hion laugh; he is above it. It may create a &s;mile, but a loud laughter &s;hows, that a man has not the command of him&s;elf, every one who would wi&s;h to appear &s;en&s;ible mu&s;t abhor it.</P>
<P>A man's going to &s;it down, on &s;uppo&s;ition that he has a chair be|hind him, and falling for want of one, occa&s;ions a general laugh, when the be&s;t pieces of wit would not do it; a &s;ufficient proof, how low and unbecoming laughter is.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, could the immediate laugher hear his own noi&s;e, or &s;ee the faces he makes, he would de&s;pi&s;e him&s;elf for his folly. Laughter being generally &s;uppo&s;ed to be the effect of gaiety, its ab&s;urdity is not properly attended to; but a little reflexion will ea&s;ily re&s;train it; and when you are told, it is a mark of low breeding, I per&s;uade my&s;elf you will endeavour to avoid it.</P>
<P>Some people have a &s;illy trick of laughing whenever they &s;peak; &s;o that they are always on the grin, and their faces are ever di&s;torted. This and a thou&s;and other tricks, &s;uch as &s;cratching their heads, twirling their hats, fumbling with their button, playing with their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, &amp;c. &amp;c. are acquired from a fal&s;e mode&s;ty at their fir&s;t out|&s;et in life. Being &s;hame-faced in company, they try a variety of ways to keep them&s;elves in countenance; thus, they fall into the&s;e awkward habits I have mentioned, which grow upon them, and in time become habitual.</P>
<P>Nothing is more repugnant likewi&s;e to good breeding than, hor&s;e|play of any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ort, romping, throwing things at one another's heads, and &s;o on. They may pa&s;s well enough with the mob, but they le&s;|&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n and degrade the gentleman.</P>

<HEAD>SUNDRY LITTLE ACCOMPLISHMENTS.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE had rea&s;ons to ob&s;erve before, that various little matters, apparently trifling in them&s;elves, con&s;pire to form the <HI>whole</HI> of plea&s;ing, as in a well fini&s;hed portrait, a variety of colours combine to complete the piece. It not being nece&s;&s;ary to dwell much upon them, I &s;hall content my&s;elf, with ju&s;t mentioning them as they occur.</P>
<P N="1">1. To do the honours of a table gracefully, is one of the outlines of a well-bred man; and to carve well, is an article, little as it may &s;eem, that is u&s;eful twice every day, and the doing of which ill, is not only trouble&s;ome to one's &s;elf, but renders us di&s;agreeable and ridiculous to others. We are always in pain for a man, who in&s;tead of cutting up a fowl genteelly, is hacking for half an hour acro&s;s the the bone, grea&s;ing him&s;elf, and be&s;pattering the company with the &s;auce. U&s;e, with a little attention, is all that is requi&s;ite to acquit your&s;elf in this particular.</P>
<P N="2">2. To be well received, you mu&s;t al&s;o pay &s;ome attention to your behaviour at table, where it is exceedingly rude to &s;cratch any part of your body, to &s;pit or blow your no&s;e, if you can po&s;&s;ibly avoid it, to eat greedily, to lean your elbows on the table, to pick your teeth before the di&s;hes are removed, or to leave the table before grace is &s;aid.</P>
<P N="3">3. Drinking of healths is now growing out of fa&s;hion, and is very unpolite in good company. Cu&s;tom once had made it univer&s;al, but the improved manners of the age now renders it vulgar. What can be more rude, or ridiculous than to interrupt per&s;ons at their mea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> with an unnece&s;&s;ary compliment? Ab&s;tain then from this &s;illy cu&s;tom, where you find it out of u&s;e; and u&s;e it only at tho&s;e tables where it continues general.</P>
<P N="4">4. A polite manner of refu&s;ing to comply with the &s;olicitations of a company, is al&s;o very nece&s;&s;ary to be learnt; for, a young man, who &s;eems to have no will of his own, but does every thing that is a&s;ked of him, may be a very good-natured fellow, but he is a very &s;illy one. If you are invited to drink at any man's hou&s;e, more than you think is whole&s;ome, you may &s;ay, "you wi&s;h you could, but that &s;o little makes you both drunk and &s;ick, that you &s;hall only be bad company by doing it: of cour&s;e, beg to be excu&s;ed." If de|&s;ired to play at cards deeper than you would, refu&s;e it ludicrou&s;ly; tell them, <Q>if you were &s;ure to lo&s;e, you might po&s;&s;ibly &s;it down; but that as fortune may be favourable, you dread the thought of having too much money, ever &s;ince you found what an incumbrance it was to poor Harlequin, and therefore you are re&s;olved never to put your&s;elf in the way of winning more than &s;uch or &s;uch a &s;um a-day.</Q> This light way of declining invitations to vice and folly, is more becoming a young man, than philo&s;ophical or &s;ententious re|fu&s;als, which would only be laughed at.</P>
<P N="5">5. Now I am on the &s;ubject of cards, I mu&s;t not omit mentioning the nece&s;&s;ity of playing them well and genteelly, if you would be thought to have kept company. I would by no means recommend play|ing at cards as a part of your &s;tudy, le&s;t you would grow too fond of
<PB N="25" REF="027039_0028_0FD2F9F872046D98">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and the con&s;equence prove bad. It were better not to know a diamond from a club, than to become a gambler; but, as cu&s;tom has introduced innocent card-playing at mo&s;t friendly meetings, it marks <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he gentleman to handle them genteelly, and play them well, and as I hope you will play only for &s;mall &s;ums, &s;hould you lo&s;e your mo|ney, pray lo&s;e it with temper; or if you win, receive your winnings without elation or greedine&s;s.</P>
<P N="6">6. To write well and correct, and in a plea&s;ing &s;tyle, is another part of polite education. Every man who has the u&s;e of his eyes and right hand, can write whatever hand he plea&s;es. Nothing is &s;o illi|beral as a &s;chool-boy's &s;crawl. I would not have you learn a &s;tiff formal hand-writing like that of a &s;chool-ma&s;ter, but a genteel, legi|ble, and liberal hand, and to be able to write quick. As to the correctne&s;s and elegance of your writing, attention to grammar does the one, and to the be&s;t authors the other. Epi&s;tolary corre&s;pon|dence &s;hould not be carried on in a &s;tudied or affected &s;tyle, but the language &s;hould flow from the pen, as naturally and as ea&s;ily as it would from the mouth. In &s;hort, a letter &s;hould be penned in the &s;ame &s;tyle, as you would talk to your friend if he were pre&s;ent.</P>
<P N="7">7. If writing well &s;hows the gentleman, much more &s;o does &s;pell|ing well. It is &s;o e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary for a gentleman, or a man of letters, that one fal&s;e &s;pelling may fix a ridicule on him for the re|mainder of his life. Words in books are generally well &s;pelled, ac|cording to the orthography of the age; reading therefore, with at|tention, will teach every one to &s;pell right. It &s;ometimes happens that words &s;hall be &s;pelled differently by different authors; but if you &s;pell them upon the authority of one, in e&s;timation of the pub|lic, you will e&s;cape ridicule. Where there is but one way of &s;pelling a word, by your &s;pelling it wrong, you will be &s;ure to be laughed at. For a <HI>woman</HI> of a tolerable education would laugh at and de&s;pi&s;e her lover, if he wrote to her, and the words were ill-&s;pelled. Be parti|cularly attentive then to your &s;pelling.</P>
<P N="8">8. There is nothing that a young man, at his fir&s;t appearance in life, ought more to dread, than having any ridicule fixed on him. In the e&s;timation even of the mo&s;t rational men, it will le&s;&s;en him, but ruin him with all the re&s;t. Many a man has been undone by a ridiculous nick-name. The cau&s;es of nick-names among well-bred men, are generally the little defects in manner, air, or addre&s;s. To have the appellation of ill-bred, awkward, muttering, left-leg|ged, or any other, tacked always to your name, would injure you more than you are aware of; avoid then tho&s;e little defects, (and they are ea&s;ily avoided) and you need never fear a nick-name.</P>
<P N="9">9. Some young men are apt to think that they cannot be complete gentlemen, without becoming men of plea&s;ure: and the rake they often mi&s;take for the man of plea&s;ure. A rake is made up of the meane&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;graceful vices. They all combine to degrade his character, and ruin his health and fortune&punc; A man of plea&s;ure will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">efine upon the enjoyments of the age, attend them with decency and partake of them becomingly. Indeed he is too often le&s;s &s;cru|pulous than he &s;hould be, and frequently has the cau&s;e to repent it. A man of plea&s;ure at be&s;t is but a di&s;&s;ipated being, and what the ra|tional part of mankind mu&s;t abhor; I mention it however, le&s;t in taking up the man of plea&s;ure, you &s;hould fall into the rake: for of
<PB N="26" REF="027039_0029_0FD2F9FB874851A0">
two evils, always choo&s;e the lea&s;t. A di&s;&s;olute flagitious footman may make as good a rake as a man of the fir&s;t quality. Few men can be men of plea&s;ure; every man may be a rake. There is a certain dignity that &s;hould be pre&s;erved in all our plea&s;ures; in love a man may lo&s;e his heart without lo&s;ing his no&s;e; at table, a man may have a di&s;tingui&s;hing palate without being a glutton; he may love wine without being a drunkard; he may game without being a gambler; and &s;o on. Every virtue has its kindred vice, and every plea&s;ure its neighbouring di&s;grace. Temperance and moderation, mark the gen|tleman; but exce&s;s the black-guard. Attend carefully then to the line that divides them; and remember to &s;top rather a yard &s;hort, than &s;tep an inch beyond it. Weigh the pre&s;ent enjoyment of your plea&s;ures again&s;t the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences of them, and I will leave you to your own determination.</P>
<P N="10">10. A gentleman has ever &s;ome regard al&s;o to the <HI>choice</HI> of his amu&s;e|ments. If at cards, he will not be &s;een at cribbage, all-fours, or putt; or, in &s;ports of exerci&s;e, at &s;kittles, foot-ball, leap-frog, cricket, driving of coaches, &amp;c. but will pre&s;erve a propriety in every part of his conduct; knowing that any imitations of the manners of the mob, will unavoidably &s;tamp him with vulgarity. There is another amu&s;ement too, which I cannot help calling illiberal, that is, playing upon any mu&s;ical in&s;trument. Mu&s;ic is commonly reckoned one of the liberal arts, and undoubtedly is &s;o; but to be piping or fiddling at a concert is degrading to a man of fa&s;hion. If you love mu&s;ic, hear it; pay fiddlers to play to you, but never fiddle your&s;elf. It makes a gentleman appear frivolous and contemptible, leads him fre|quently into bad company, and wa&s;tes that time which might other|wi&s;e be well employed.</P>
<P N="11">11. Secrecy is another characteri&s;tic of good breeding. Be careful never to tell in one company what you &s;ee or hear in another; much le&s;s to divert the pre&s;ent company at the expence of the la&s;t. Things apparently indifferent may, when often repeated and told abroad, have much more &s;erious con&s;equences than imagined. In conver&s;a|tion, there is generally a tacit reliance, that what is &s;aid will not be repeated; and a man, though not enjoined to &s;ecrecy, will be ex|cluded company if found to be a tatler; be&s;ides, he will draw him|&s;elf into a thou&s;and &s;crapes, and every one will be afraid to &s;peak before him.</P>
<P N="12">12. Pulling out your watch in company una&s;ked, either at home or abroad, is a mark of ill-breeding; if at home, it appears as if you were tired of your company, and wi&s;hed them to be gone; if abroad, as if the hours dragged heavily, and you wi&s;hed to be gone your&s;elf. If you want to know the time, withdraw; be&s;ides, as the taking what is called a French leave was introduced, that on the per&s;on's leaving the company, the re&s;t might not be di&s;turbed; look|ing at your watch does what that piece of politene&s;s was de&s;igned to prevent; it is a kind of dictating to all pre&s;ent, and telling them it is time, or almo&s;t time to break up.</P>
<P N="13">13. Among other things let me caution you again&s;t ever being in a hurry: a man of &s;en&s;e may be in ha&s;te, but he is never in a hurry: convinced that hurry is the &s;ure&s;t way to make him do what he un|dertakes ill. To be in a hurry is a proof that the bu&s;ine&s;s we em|bark
<PB N="27" REF="027039_0030_0FD2F9FD16962290">
in is too great for us; of cour&s;e, it is the mark of little minds, that are puzzled and perplexed, when they &s;hould be cool and de|liberate; they wi&s;h do every thing at once, and are thus able to do nothing. Be &s;teady then, in all your engagements; look round you, before you begin; and remember that you had better do half of them well, and leave the re&s;t undone, than do the whole indif|ferently.</P>
<P N="14">14. From a kind of fal&s;e mode&s;ty, mo&s;t young men are apt to con&s;ider familiarity as unbecoming. Forwardne&s;s, I allow is &s;o; but there is a decent familiarity that is nece&s;&s;ary in the cour&s;e of life. More formal vi&s;its, upon formal invitations, are not the thing; they create no connexion, nor will they prove of &s;ervice to you; it is the carele&s;s and ea&s;y ingre&s;s and egre&s;s, at all hours, that &s;ecures an ac|quaintance to our intere&s;t, and this is acquired by a re&s;pectful familia|rity entered into, without forfeiting your con&s;equence.</P>
<P N="15">15. In acquiring new acquaintances, be careful not to neglect your old, for a flight of this kind is &s;eldom forgiven. If you can|not be with your former acquaintance &s;o often as you u&s;ed to be when you had no others, take care not to give them cau&s;e to think you neglect them: call upon them frequently though you cannot &s;tay long with them; tell them, you are &s;orry to leave them &s;o &s;oon, and nothing &s;hould take you away but certain engagements which good-manners oblige you to attend to; for it will be your intere&s;t to make all the friends you can, and as few enemies as po&s;&s;ible; by friends I would not be under&s;tood to mean confidential ones: but per&s;ons who &s;peak of you re&s;pectfully, and who, con&s;i&s;tent with; their own intere&s;t, would wi&s;h to be of &s;ervice to you, and would rather do you good than harm.</P>
<P N="16">16. Another thing I mu&s;t recommend to you, as characteri&s;tic of a polite education, and of having kept good company, is a graceful man|ner of confering favours. The mo&s;t obliging things may be done &s;o awkwardly as to offend, while the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable things may be done &s;o agreeable as to plea&s;e.</P>
<P N="17">17. A few more articles of general advice, and I have done; the fir&s;t is on the &s;ubject of vanity. It is the common failing of youth and &s;uch as ought to be carefully guarded again&s;t. The vanity I mean, is that which, if given way to, &s;tamps a man a coxcomb, a character he will find a difficulty to get rid of, perhaps as long as he lives. Now this vanity &s;hows it&s;elf in a variety of &s;hapes; one man &s;hall pride him&s;elf in taking the lead in all conver&s;ations, and peremptorily deciding upon every &s;ubject; another, de&s;irous of ap|pearing &s;ucce&s;sful among the women, &s;hall in&s;inuate the encourage|ment he has met with, the conque&s;ts he makes, and perhaps boa&s;ts of favours he never received; if he &s;peaks truth, he is ungenerous; if fal&s;e, he is a villain, but whether true or fal&s;e, defeats his own purpo&s;es, overthrows the reputation he wi&s;hes to erect, and draws upon him&s;elf contempt in the room of re&s;pect. Some men are vain enough to think they acquire con&s;equence by alliance, or by an ac|quaintance with per&s;ons of di&s;tingui&s;hed character or abilities; hence they are continually telling of their grand-father lord &s;uch-a-one; their kin&s;man Sir William &s;uch-a-one; or their intimate friend Dr. &s;uch-a-one; with whom perhaps they are &s;carce acquainted. If they are ever found out (and that they are &s;ure to be one time or other)
<PB N="28" REF="027039_0031_0FD2FA020519ADE8">
they become ridiculous and contemptible: but even admitting what they &s;ay to be true, what then? A man's intrin&s;ic merit does not ri&s;e from an ennobled alliance, or a reputable acquaintance. A rich man never borrows. When angling for prai&s;e, mode&s;ty is the &s;ure&s;t bait. If we would wi&s;h to &s;hine in any particular character, we mu&s;t ne|ver affect that character. An affectation of courage will make a man pa&s;s for a bully; an affectation of wit for a coxcomb; and an affec|tation of &s;en&s;e for a fool. Not that I would recommend ba&s;hful|ne&s;s or timidity; no, I would have every one know his own value, yet not di&s;cover that he knows it, but leave his merit to be found out by others.</P>
<P N="18">18. Another thing worth your attention is, if in company with an inferior, not to let him feel his inferiority; if he di&s;covers it him|&s;elf without your endeavour, the fault is not yours, and he will not blame you; but if you take pains to mortify him, or to make him feel him&s;elf inferior to you, in abilities, fortune, or rank, it is an in&s;ult that will not readily be forgiven. In point of abilities it would be unju&s;t, as they are out of his power; in point of rank or for|tune, it is ill-natured and ill-bred. This rule is never more nece&s;|&s;ary than at table, where there cannot be a greater in&s;ult than to help an inferior to a part he di&s;likes, or a part that may be wor&s;e than or|dinary, and to take the be&s;t to your&s;elf. If you at any time invite an inferior to your table, you put him during the time he is there, upon an equality with you, and it is an act of the highe&s;t rudene&s;s to treat him in any re&s;pect &s;lightingly. I would rather double my at|tention to &s;uch a per&s;on, and treat him with additional re&s;pect, le&s;t he &s;hould even &s;uppo&s;e him&s;elf neglected. There cannot be a greater &s;avagene&s;s or cruelty, or any thing more degrading to a man of fa&s;hion, than to put upon or take unbecoming liberties with him, who&s;e mode&s;ty, humility, or re&s;pect will not &s;uffer him to retaliate. True politene&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in making every body about you happy; and as to mortify, is to render unhappy, it can be nothing but the wor&s;t of breeding. Make it a rule rather to flatter a per&s;on's vanity than otherwi&s;e; make him, if po&s;&s;ible, more in love with him&s;elf, and you will be certain to gain his e&s;teem; never tell him any thing he may not like to hear, nor &s;ay things that will put him out of coun|tenance, but let it be your &s;tudy on all occa&s;ions to plea&s;e; this will be making friends in&s;tead of enemies, and be a means of helping your&s;elf in the end.</P>
<P N="19">19. Never be witty at the expence of any one pre&s;ent, nor gra|tify that idle inclination, which is too &s;trong in mo&s;t young men, I mean laughing at, or ridiculing the weakne&s;&s;es or infirmities of others, by way of diverting the company or di&s;playing your own &s;uperiority. Mo&s;t people have their weakne&s;&s;es, their peculiar lik|ings and aver&s;ions. Some cannot bear the &s;ight of a cat; others the &s;mell of chee&s;e, and &s;o on; was you to laugh at tho&s;e men for their antipathies, or by de&s;ign or inattention to bring them in their way, you could not in&s;ult them more. You may po&s;&s;ibly thus gain the laugh on your &s;ide, for the pre&s;ent, but it will make the per&s;on, perhaps, at who&s;e expence you are merry, your enemy for ever af|ter; and even tho&s;e who laugh with you, will, on a little reflexion, fear you and probably de&s;pi&s;e you; whereas, to procure what <HI>one</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="027039_0032_0FD2FA0415E44368">
likes, and remove what the <HI>other</HI> hates, would &s;how them that they were the objects of your attention, and po&s;&s;ibly make them more your friends than much greater &s;ervices would have done. If you have wit, u&s;e it to plea&s;e, but not to hurt. You may &s;hine, but take care not to &s;corch. In &s;hort, never &s;eem to &s;ee the faults of others. Though among the ma&s;s of men, there are, doubtle&s;s, numbers of fools and knaves, yet were we to tell eve|ry one of the&s;e we meet with, that we know them to be &s;o, we &s;hould be in perpetual war. I would dete&s;t the knave and pity the fool, wherever I found him; but I would let neither of them know unnece&s;&s;arily that I did &s;o; as I would not be in|du&s;trious to make my&s;elf enemies. As one mu&s;t plea&s;e others, in order to be plea&s;ed one's &s;elf; con&s;ider what is agreeable to you, mu&s;t be agreeable to them, and conduct your&s;elf accord|ingly.</P>
<P N="20">20. Whi&s;pering in company is another act of ill-breeding: it &s;eems to in&s;inuate, either that the per&s;ons whom we would not wi&s;h &s;hould hear, are unworthy of our confidence, or it may lead them to &s;uppo&s;e we are &s;peaking improperly of them: on both accounts therefore, ab&s;tain from it.</P>
<P N="21">21. So pulling out one letter after another, and reading them in company, or cutting and paring one's nails, is unpolite and rude. It &s;eems to &s;ay, we are weary of the conver&s;ation, and are in want of &s;ome amu&s;ement to pa&s;s away the time.</P>
<P N="22">22. Humming a tune to our&s;elves, drumming with our fingers on the table, making a noi&s;e with our feet, and &s;uch like, are all breaches of good manners, and indications of our contempt for the per&s;ons pre&s;ent; therefore they &s;hould not be indulged.</P>
<P N="23">23. Walking fa&s;t in the &s;treets is a mark of vulgarity imply|ing hurry of bu&s;ine&s;s: it may appear well in a mechanic of trade&s;|man, but it &s;uits ill with the character of a gentleman or a man of fa&s;hion.</P>
<P N="24">24. Staring any per&s;on you meet, full in the face, is an act al&s;o of ill-breeding; it looks as if you &s;aw &s;omething wonderful in his appearance, and is therefore a tacit reprehen&s;ion</P>
<P N="25">25. Eating quick, or very &s;low at meals is characteri&s;tic of the vulgar; the fir&s;t infers poverty, that you have not had a good meal for &s;ome time; the la&s;t, if abroad, that you di&s;like your entertaiment; if at home, that your are rude enough to &s;et be|fore your friends what you cannot eat your&s;elf. So again, eat|ing your &s;oup with your no&s;e in the plate is vulgar; it has the ap|pearance of being u&s;ed to hard work, and of cour&s;e an un&s;teady hand. If it be nece&s;&s;ary then to avoid this, it is much more &s;o that of</P>
<P N="26">26. Smelling to the meat while on the fork, before you put it in your mouth. I have &s;een many ill-bred fellows do this, and have been &s;o angry, that I could have kicked them from the ta|ble. If you di&s;like what you have upon your place, leave it; but on no account, by &s;melling to, or examining it, charge your friend with putting unwhole&s;ome provi&s;ions before you.</P>
<P N="27">27. Spitting on the carpet is a na&s;ty practice, and &s;hocking,
<PB N="30" REF="027039_0033_0FD2FA06B2631410">
in a man of liberal education. Was this to become general, it would be us nece&s;&s;ary to change the carpets as the table-cloths; be&s;ides, it will lead our acquaintance to &s;uppo&s;e, that we have not been u&s;ed to genteel furniture; for this rea&s;on alone, if for no other, by all means avoid it.</P>
<P N="28">28. Keep your&s;elf likewi&s;e free from odd tricks or habits; &s;uch as thru&s;ting out your tongue continually, &s;napping your fingers, rubbing your hands, &s;ighing aloud, an affected &s;hivering of your whole body, gaping with a noi&s;e like a country fellow that has been &s;leeping in a hay-loft, or indeed with any noi&s;e, and many others, which I have noticed before; the&s;e are imi|tations of the manners of the mob, and are degrading to a gen|tleman.</P>
<P>A very little attention will get the better of all the&s;e ill-bred habits, and be a&s;&s;ured, you will find your own account in it.</P>

<HEAD>EMPLOYMENT OF TIME.</HEAD>
<P>EMPLOYMENT of time, is a &s;ubject, that from its import|ance, de&s;erves your be&s;t attention. Mo&s;t young gentlemen have a great deal of time before them, and one hour well em|ployed in the early part of life, is more valuable and will be of greater u&s;e to you, than perhaps four and twenty &s;ome years to come.</P>
<P>Whatever time you can &s;teal from company and from the &s;tu|dy of the world; (I &s;ay company, for a knowledge of life is be&s;t learned in various companies) employ it in &s;erious reading. Take up &s;ome valuable book, and continue the reading of that book, till you have got through it; never burden your mind with more than one thing at a time: and in reading this book, don't run over it &s;uperficially, but read every pa&s;&s;age twice over, at lea&s;t do not pa&s;s on to a &s;econd till you thoroughly under&s;tand the fir&s;t, nor quit the book till you are ma&s;ter of the &s;ubject; for unle&s;s you do this, you may read it through and not remember the contents of it for a week. The books I would particularly recommend among others, are <HI>Cardinal Retz's Maxims, Roche&s;ou|cauld's Moral Reflexions, Bruyer's Characters, Fontenelle's Plurality of Worlds, Sir Jo&s;iah Child on Trade, Bolingbroke's,</HI> for &s;tyle, his <HI>Remarks <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the Hi&s;tory of England,</HI> under the name of Sir John <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words">; <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ffendorff's Jus Gentiu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> and <HI>Grotius de Jure Belli et Pacis:</HI> the la&s;t two are well tran&s;lated by Barbeyrac. For occa&s;ional half hours or le&s;s, read the be&s;t works of invention, wit and humour, but never wa&s;te your minutes on trifling authors either ancient or mo|dern.</P>
<P>Any bu&s;ine&s;s you may have to tran&s;act, &s;hould be done the fir&s;t opportunity, and fini&s;hed, if po&s;&s;ible, without interruption; for by defering it, you may probably fini&s;h it too late or execute it indifferently. Now, bu&s;ine&s;s of any kind &s;hould never be done by halves; but every part of it &s;hould be well attended to: for he that does bu&s;ine&s;s ill, had better not do it at all. And, in

any point, which di&s;cretion bids you pur&s;ue, and which has a manife&s;t utility to recommend it, let no difficulties deter you; rather let them animate your indu&s;try. If one method fails, try a &s;econd and a third. Be active, per&s;evere, and you will certain|ly conquer.</P>
<P>Never indulge a lazy di&s;po&s;ition; there are few things but are attended with &s;ome difficulties, and if you are frightened at tho&s;e difficulties, you will not complete any thing. Indolent minds prefer ignorance to trouble; they look upon mo&s;t things as im|po&s;&s;ible, becau&s;e perhaps they are difficult. Even an hour's at|tention is too laborious for them, and they would rather content them&s;elves with the fir&s;t view of things, than take the trouble to look any further into them. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s, when they come to talk upon &s;ubjects to tho&s;e who have &s;tudied them, they betray an un|pardonable ignorance; and lay them&s;elves open to an&s;wers that confu&s;e them. Be careful then; that you do not get the appellation of indolent; and if po&s;&s;ible avoid the character of frivolous. For,</P>
<P>The frivolous mind is always bu&s;ied upon nothing. It mi&s;takes trifling objects for important ones; and &s;pends that time upon little matters, that &s;hould only be employed upon greater ones.</P>
<P>Knick-nacks, butterflies, &s;hells, and &s;uch-like, engro&s;s the at|tention of the frivolous man, and fill up all his time. He &s;tu|dies the dre&s;s, and not the characters of men, and his &s;ubjects of conver&s;ation are no other than the weather, his own dome&s;tic affairs, his &s;ervants, his method of managing his family; the lit|tle anecdotes of the neighbourhood, and the fiddle &s;addle &s;tories of the day; void of information, void of improvement. The&s;e he relates with empha&s;is, as intere&s;ting matters; in &s;hort he is a male go&s;&s;ip. I appeal to your own feelings now, whether &s;uch things do not le&s;&s;en a man, in the opinion of his acquaintance, and in&s;tead of attracting e&s;teem, create a di&s;gu&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>DIGNITY OF MANNERS.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a certain dignity of manners, without which the very be&s;t characters would not be valued.</P>
<P>Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ping, loud and frequent laughing, punning, joking, mi|mickry, waggery, and too great and indi&s;criminate familiarity, will render any man contemptible, in &s;pite of all his knowledge or his merit. The&s;e may con&s;titute a merry fellow&punc; but a merry fellow was never yet re&s;pectable. Indi&s;criminate familiarity will either offend your &s;uperiors, or make you pa&s;s for their depen|dant or toad-eater, and it will put your inferiors, on a degree of equality with you, that may be trouble&s;ome.</P>
<P>A joke, if it carries a &s;ting along with it, is no longer a joke, but an affront; and even if it has no &s;ting, unle&s;s its wittici&s;m is delicate and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in&s;tead of giving plea&s;ure it will di&s;gu&s;t; or if the company <HI>&s;hould</HI> laugh, they will probably laugh at the je&s;ter rather than the je&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="027039_0035_0FD2FA0841590438">
Punning is mere playing upon words, and far from being a mark of &s;en&s;e: thus were we to &s;ay, &s;uch a dre&s;s is <HI>commodious,</HI> one of the&s;e wags would an&s;wer <HI>odious;</HI> or that whatever it has been, it is now be-<HI>com-odious.</HI> Others will give us an an&s;wer dif|ferent from what we &s;hould expect, without either wit or the lea&s;t beauty of thought; as&punc; "<HI>Where's my lord?&mdash;" In his cloaths, unle&s;s he is in bed." "How does this wine ta&s;te?&mdash;"A little moi&s;t, I think." "How is this to be eaten?</HI>&mdash;<HI>"With your mouth;</HI>" and &s;o on, all which (you will readily apprehend) is low and vulgar. If your wittici&s;ms are not in&s;tantly approved by the laugh of the company, for heaven's &s;ake, don't attempt to be witty for the future; for you may take it for granted, the defect is in your&s;elf, and not in your hearers.</P>
<P>As to a mimic or wag, he is little el&s;e than a buffoon, who will di&s;tort his mouth and his eyes to make people laugh. Be a&s;&s;ured, no per&s;on ever demeaned him&s;elf to plea&s;e the re&s;t, unle&s;s he wi&s;hed to be thought the Merry-Andrew of the company, and whether this character is re&s;pectable, I leave you to judge.</P>
<P>If a man's company is coveted on any other account than his knowledge, his good &s;en&s;e, or his manners, he is &s;eldom re&s;pect|ed by tho&s;e who invite him, but made u&s;e of only to entertain. "Let's have &s;uch-a-one, for he &s;ings a good &s;ong, or he is always joking or laughing; or, "Let's &s;end for &s;uch-a-one, for he is a good-bottle companion;" the&s;e are degrading di&s;tinctions, that preclude re&s;pect and e&s;teem, whoever <HI>is had</HI> (as the phra&s;e is) for the &s;ake of any qualification, &s;ingly, is merely that thing he <HI>is had</HI> for, is never con&s;idered in any other light, and, of cour&s;e, ne|ver properly re&s;pected, let his intrin&s;ic merits be what they will.</P>
<P>You may po&s;&s;ibly &s;uppo&s;e this dignity of manners to border upon pride; but it differs as much from pride, as true courage from blu&s;tering.</P>
<P>To flatter a per&s;on right or wrong, is abject flattery; and to con&s;ent readily to do every thing propo&s;ed by a company, be it &s;illy or criminal, is full as degrading as to di&s;pute warmly upon eve|ry &s;ubject, and to contradict upon all actions. To pre&s;erve dig|nity, we &s;hould mode&s;tly a&s;&s;ert our own &s;entiments, though we politely acquie&s;ce in tho&s;e of others.</P>
<P>So again, to &s;upport dignity of character, we &s;hould neither be frivolou&s;ly curious about trifles, nor be laboriou&s;ly intent upon lit|tle objects that de&s;erve not a moment's attention; for this im|plies an incapacity in matters of greater importance.</P>
<P>A great deal likewi&s;e depends upon our air, addre&s;s and ex|pre&s;&s;ions; an awkward addre&s;s and vulgar expre&s;&s;ions infer either a low turn of mind, or a low education.</P>
<P>In&s;olent contempt or low envy is incompatible al&s;o with dignity of manners. Low-bred per&s;ons fortunately lifted in the world, in fine cloaths and fine equipages, will in&s;olently look down on all tho&s;e who cannot afford to make as good an appear|ance, and they openly envy tho&s;e who perhaps make a better. They al&s;o dread the being &s;lighted; of cour&s;e are &s;u&s;picious and
<PB N="33" REF="027039_0036_0FD2FA0ADDEDFCC0">
captious; are unea&s;y to them&s;elves, and make every body el&s;e &s;o about them.</P>
<P>A certain degree of outward &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s in looks and actions, gives dignity, while a con&s;tant &s;mirk upon the face (that in&s;ipid &s;illy &s;mile, which fools have when they would be civil) and whif|fling motions are &s;trong marks of futility.</P>
<P>But above all; a dignity of character is to be acquired be&s;t by a certain firmne&s;s in all our actions. A mean, timid and pa&s;&s;ive complai&s;ance lets a man down more than he is aware of: but &s;till his firmne&s;s or re&s;olution &s;hould not extend to brutality, but be accompanied with a peculiar and engaging &s;oftne&s;s or mildne&s;s.</P>
<P>If you di&s;cover any ha&s;tine&s;s in your temper, and find it apt to break out into rough and unguarded expre&s;&s;ions, watch it narrow|ly, and endeavour to curb it; but let no complai&s;ance, no weak de&s;ire of plea&s;ing, no wheedling, urge you to do that which di&s;cre|tion forbids; but per&s;i&s;t and per&s;evere in all that is right. In your connexions and friend&s;hips, you will find this rule of u&s;e to you. Invite and pre&s;erve attachments, by your firmne&s;s: but la|bour to keep clear of enemies by a mildne&s;s of behaviour. Di&s;|arm tho&s;e enemies you may unfortunately have, (and few are with|out them) by a gentlene&s;s of manner, but make them feel the &s;teadi|ne&s;s of your re&s;entment; for there is a wide difference between bear|ing malice, and a determined &s;elf-defence; the one is imperious, but the other is prudent and ju&s;tifiable.</P>
<P>In directing your &s;ervants, or any per&s;on you have a right to com|mand; if you deliver your orders mildly, and in that engaging man|ner, which every gentleman &s;hould &s;tudy to do, you will be cheer|fully and con&s;equently well obeyed: but if tyrannically, you would be very unwillingly &s;erved, if &s;erved at all. A cool &s;teady determin|ation &s;hould &s;how that you <HI>will</HI> be obeyed; but a gentlene&s;s, in the manner of enforcing that obedience, &s;hould make &s;ervice a cheerful one. Thus will you be loved without being de&s;pi&s;ed, and feared without being hated.</P>
<P>I hope I need not mention vices. A man who has been patiently kicked out of company, may have as good a pretence to courage, as one rendered infamous by his vices, may to dignity of any kind; however of &s;uch con&s;equence are appearances, that an outward de|cency, and an affected dignity of manners, will even keep &s;uch a man the longer from &s;inking&punc; If therefore you &s;hould unfortunately have no intrin&s;ic merit of our own, keep up, if po&s;&s;ible, the appear|ance of it; and the world will po&s;&s;ibly give you credit for the re&s;t. A ver&s;atility of manners is as nece&s;&s;ary in &s;ocial life, as a ver&s;atility of parts in political. This is no way blameable, if not u&s;ed with an ill-de|&s;ign. We mu&s;t like the cameleon, often put on the hue of the per|&s;ons we wi&s;h to be well with: and it &s;urely can never be blameable, to endeavour to gain the good-will or affection of any one, if when obtained we do not mean to abu&s;e it.</P>

<HEAD>RULES FOR CONVERSATION.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING now given you full and &s;ufficient in&s;tructions for making you well received in the be&s;t of companies: nothing
<PB N="34" REF="027039_0037_0FD2FA0B220E23C0">
remains but that I lay before you &s;ome few rules for your conduct in &s;uch company. Many things on this &s;ubject I have mentioned before; but &s;ome few matters remain to be mentioned now.</P>
<P N="1">1. Talk then frequently: but not long together, le&s;t you tire the per&s;ons you are &s;peaking to; for few per&s;ons talk &s;o well upon a &s;ubject, as to keep up the attention of their hearers for any length of time.</P>
<P N="2">2. Avoid telling &s;tories in company, unle&s;s they are very &s;hort indeed, and very applicable to the &s;ubject you are upon; in this ca&s;e relate them in as few words as po&s;&s;ible, without the lea&s;t di|gre&s;&s;ion, and with &s;ome apology; as that you hate the telling of &s;tories, but the &s;hortne&s;s of it induced you. And, if your &s;tory has any wit in it, be particularly careful not to laugh at it your|&s;elf. Nothing is more tire&s;ome and di&s;agreeable than a long te|dious narrative; it betrays a go&s;&s;iping di&s;po&s;ition and great want of imagination; and nothing is more ridiculous than to expre&s;s an approbation of your own &s;tory by a laugh.</P>
<P N="3">3. In relating any thing, keep clear of repetitions, or very hackneyed expre&s;&s;ions, &s;uch as, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> or <HI>&s;ays &s;he.</HI> Some people will u&s;e the&s;e &s;o often, as to take off the hearer's attention from the &s;tory: as in an organ out of tune, one pipe &s;hall perhaps found the whole time we are playing, and confu&s;e the piece &s;o as not to be under&s;tood.</P>
<P N="4">4. Digre&s;&s;ions likewi&s;e, &s;hould be guarded again&s;t. A &s;tory is always more agreeable without them. Of this kind are, "<HI>the gentleman I am telling you of is the &s;on of Sir Thomas&mdash;, who lives in Harley-&s;treet;&mdash;you mu&s;t know him&mdash;his brother had a hor&s;e that won the &s;weep&s;takes at the la&s;t New-market meeting&mdash;Zounds! if you don't know him, you know nothing.</HI>" Or, "<HI>He was an upright tall old gentleman, who wore his own long hair: don't you recollect him?</HI>"&mdash;All this is unne|ce&s;&s;ary; is very tire&s;ome and provoking, and would be an excu&s;e for a man's behaviour, if he was to leave us in the mid&s;t of our narrative.</P>
<P N="5">5. Some people have a trick of holding the per&s;on they are &s;peaking to by the button, or the hand, in order to be heard out; con&s;cious, I &s;uppo&s;e, that their tale is tire&s;ome. Pray never do this; if the per&s;on you &s;peak to is not as willing to hear your &s;tory as you are to tell it, you had much better break off in the middle, for if you tire them once, they will be afraid to li&s;ten to you a &s;econd time.</P>
<P N="6">6. Others have a way of punching the per&s;on they are talking to in the &s;ide, and, at the end of every &s;entence, a&s;king him &s;ome &s;uch que&s;tions as the following: "Wa&s;n't I right in that?"&mdash;"You know I told you &s;o?"&mdash;"What's your opinion," and the like; or perhaps they will be threading him, or jogging him with their elbow. For mercy's &s;ake, never give way to this: it will make your company dreaded.</P>
<P N="7">7. Long talkers are frequently apt to &s;ingle out &s;ome unfortunate man pre&s;ent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> generally the mo&s;t &s;ilent one of the company, or probably one who &s;its next them. To this man, in a kind of half|whi&s;per, will they run on for half an hour together. Nothing
<PB N="35" REF="027039_0038_0FD2FA0CD4D1AE70">
can be more ill-bred. But if one of the&s;e unmerciful talkers &s;hould attack you, if you wi&s;h to oblige him, I would recommend the hearing him with patience: &s;eem to do &s;o at lea&s;t, for you could not hurt him more than to leave him in the middle of his &s;tory, or di&s;cover any impatience in the cour&s;e of it.</P>
<P N="8">8. Ince&s;&s;ant talkers are very di&s;agreeable companions. Nothing can be more rude than to engro&s;s the conver&s;ation to your&s;elf, or to take the words, as it were, out of another man's mouth. Every man in company has an equal claim to bear his part in the conver&s;ation, and to deprive him of it, is not only unju&s;t, but a tacit declaration, that he cannot &s;peak &s;o well upon the &s;ubject as your&s;elf. You will therefore take it up. And what can be more rude? I would as &s;oon forgive a man that &s;hould &s;top my mouth when I was gaping, as taking my words from me while I was &s;peaking them. Now, if this be unpardonable, it cannot be le&s;s &s;o,</P>
<P N="9">9. To help out or fore&s;tall the &s;low &s;peaker, as if you alone were rich in expre&s;&s;ions, and he were poor. You may take it for granted, every one is vain enough to think he can talk well, tho' he may mode&s;tly deny it; helping a per&s;on out therefore in his expre&s;&s;ion, is a correction that will &s;tamp the corrector with imprudence and ill-manners.</P>
<P N="10">10. Tho&s;e who contradict others upon all occa&s;ions and make every a&s;&s;ertion a matter of di&s;pute, betray by this behaviour an unacquaintance with good breeding. He therefore who wi&s;hes to appear amiable with tho&s;e he conver&s;es with, will be cautious of &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions as the&s;e, "That can't be true, Sir," "The affair is as I &s;ay;" "That mu&s;t be fal&s;e, Sir;" "If what you &s;ay is true, &amp;c." You may as well tell a man he lies at once, as thus indirectly impeach his veracity. It is equally as rude to be proving every trifling a&s;&s;ertion with a bet or a wager. "I'll bet you fifty of it, and &s;o on." Make it then a con&s;tant rule in mat|ters of no great importance, complai&s;antly to &s;ubmit your opinion to that of other; for a victory of this kind often co&s;ts a man the lo&s;s of a friend.</P>
<P N="11">11. Giving advice una&s;ked is another piece of rudene&s;s; it is, in effect, declaring our&s;elves wi&s;er than tho&s;e to whom we give it&punc; reproaching them with ignorance and inexperience. It is a freedom that ought not to be taken with any common acquaintance, and yet there are tho&s;e, who will be offended if their advice is not taken. "Such-a-one," &s;ay they, "is above being advi&s;ed." "He &s;corns to li&s;ten to my advice;" as if it were not a mark of greater arrogance to expect every one to &s;ubmit to their opinion, than for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ome|times to follow his own.</P>
<P N="12">12. There is nothing &s;o unpardonably rude, as a &s;eeming inatten|tion to the per&s;on who is &s;peaking to you; though you may meet with it in others, by all means avoid it your&s;elf. Some ill-bred peo|ple, while others are &s;peaking to them, will, in&s;tead of looking at, or attending to them, perhaps &s;ix their eyes on the cieling, or &s;ome picture in the room, look out at the window, play with a dog, their watch-chain, or their cane, or probably pick their nails or their no&s;es. Nothing betrays a more trifling mind than this; nor can any thing be a greater affront to the per&s;on &s;peaking; it being a tacit declaration,
<PB N="36" REF="027039_0039_0FD2FA0E2B613598">
that what he is &s;aying is not worth your attention. Con&s;ider with your&s;elf, how you would like &s;uch treatment, and, I am per&s;uaded, you will never &s;how it to others.</P>
<P N="13">13. Surline&s;s or moro&s;ene&s;s is incompatible al&s;o with politene&s;s. Such as &s;hould any one &s;ay "he was de&s;ired to pre&s;ent Mr. Such-a-one's re&s;pects to you," to reply, "What the devil have I do with his re&s;pects?"&mdash;"My Lord enquired after you lately, and a&s;ked how you did," to an&s;wer, "if he wi&s;hes to know, let him come and feel my pul&s;e;" and the like. A good deal of this often is affected; but whether affected or natural, it is always offen&s;ive. A man of this &s;tamp will occa&s;ionally be laughed at, as an oddity; but in the end will be de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P N="14">14. I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e it unnece&s;&s;ary to advi&s;e you to adapt your conver&s;ation to the company your are in. You would not &s;urely &s;tart the &s;ame &s;ubject, and di&s;cour&s;e of it in the &s;ame manner, with the old and with the young, with an officer, a clergyman, a philo|&s;opher and a woman? No; your good &s;en&s;e will undoubtedly teach you to be &s;erious with the &s;erious, gay with the gay, and to trifle with the triflers.</P>
<P N="15">15. There are certain expre&s;&s;ions which are exceedingly rude, and yet there are people of liberal education that &s;ometimes u&s;e them; as, "You don't under&s;tand me, Sir." "It is not &s;o." "You mi&s;|take" "You know nothing of the matter, &amp;c." Is it not better to &s;ay, "I believe I do not expre&s;s my&s;elf &s;o as to be under&s;tood." "Let us con&s;ider it again; whether we take it right or not." It is much more polite and amiable to make &s;ome excu&s;e for another, and even in ca&s;es where he might ju&s;tly be blamed, and to repre&s;ent the mi&s;take as common to both, rather than charge him with in&s;en&s;ibility or incomprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P N="16">16. If any one &s;hould have promi&s;ed you any thing, and not have fulfilled that promi&s;e, it would be very unpolite to tell him he has forfeited his word; or if the &s;ame per&s;on &s;hould have di&s;appointed you upon any occa&s;ion, would it not be better to &s;ay, "You were probably &s;o much engaged, that you forgot my affair," or, "perhaps it &s;lipped your memory," rather than, "You thought no more about it&punc;" or, "You pay very little regard to your word." For, expre&s;|&s;ions of this kind leave a &s;ting behind them. They are a kind of provocation and affront, and very often bring on la&s;ting quarrels.</P>
<P N="17">17. Be careful not to appear dark and my&s;terious, le&s;t you &s;hould be thought &s;u&s;picious, than which nothing can be a more unamiable character. If you appear my&s;terious and re&s;erved, others will be truly &s;o with you; and in this ca&s;e, there is an end to improvement, for you will gather no information. Be re&s;erved, but never &s;eem &s;o.</P>
<P N="18">18. There is fault extremely common with &s;ome people, which I would have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words">. When their opinion is a&s;ked upon any &s;ub|ject, they will give it with &s;o apparent a diffidence and timidity, that one cannot, without the utmo&s;t pain, li&s;ten to them; e&s;pecially if they are known to be men of univer&s;al knowledge. "Your Lord&s;hip will pardon me," &s;ays one of this &s;tamp, "If I &s;hould not be able to &s;peak to the ca&s;e in hand, &s;o well as it might be wi&s;hed"&mdash;"I'll venture to &s;peak of this matter, to the be&s;t of my poor abilities
<PB N="37" REF="027039_0040_0FD2FA114F04C1D0">
and dulne&s;s of apprehen&s;ion."&mdash;"I fear I &s;hall expo&s;e my&s;elf, but in obedience to your lord&s;hip's commands"&mdash;and while they are making the&s;e apologies, they interrupt the bu&s;ine&s;s and tire the company.</P>
<P N="19">19. Always look people in the face, when you &s;peak to them, otherwi&s;e you will be thought con&s;cious of &s;ome guilt; be&s;ides you lo&s;e the opportunity of reading their countenances, from which you will much better learn the impre&s;&s;ion your di&s;cour&s;e makes upon them, than you can po&s;&s;ibly do from their words; for words are at the will of every one, but the countenance is frequently involuntary.</P>
<P N="20">20. If in &s;peaking to a per&s;on, you are not heard, and &s;hould be de&s;ired to repeat what you &s;aid, do not rai&s;e your voice in the repe|tition, le&s;t you &s;hould be thought angry on being obliged to repeat what you had &s;aid before; it was probably owing to the hearer's in|attention.</P>
<P N="21">21. One word only as to &s;wearing. Tho&s;e who addict them&s;elves to it, and interlard their di&s;cour&s;e with oaths, can never be con&s;idered as gentlemen; they are generally people of low education, and are unwelcome in what is called good company. It is a vice that has no temptation to plead, but is, in every re&s;pect, as vulgar as it is wicked.</P>
<P N="22">22. Never accu&s;tom your&s;elf to &s;candal, nor li&s;ten to it; for though it may gratify the malevolence of &s;ome people; nine times out of ten, it is attended with great di&s;advantages. The very per&s;ons you tell it to, will on reflexion, entertain a mean opinion of you, and it will often bring you into very di&s;agreeable &s;ituations. And as there would be no evil &s;peakers, if there were no evil hearers; it is in &s;can|dal as in robbery; the receiver is as bad as the thief. Be&s;ides, it will lead people to &s;hun your company, &s;uppo&s;ing that you will &s;peak ill of <HI>them</HI> to the next acquaintance you meet.</P>
<P N="23">23. Mimickry, the favourite amu&s;ement of little minds, has ever been the contempt of great ones. Never give way to it your&s;elf, nor ever encourage it in others; it is the mo&s;t illiberal of all buffoon|ery; it is an in&s;ult on the per&s;on you mimic; and in&s;ults, I have often told you, are &s;eldom forgiven.</P>
<P N="24">24. Carefully avoid talking either of your own or other people's dome&s;tic concerns. By doing the one, you will be thought vain; by entering into the other, you will be con&s;idered as officious. Talking of your&s;elf is an impertinence to the company; your affairs are no|thing to them; be&s;ides, they cannot be kept too &s;ecret. And as to the affairs of others, what are they to you? In talking of matters that no way concern you, you are liable to commit blunders, and &s;hould you touch any one in a &s;ore part, you may po&s;&s;ibly lo&s;e his e&s;teem. Let your conver&s;ation then in mixed companies&punc; always be general.</P>
<P N="25">25. Jokes, <HI>Bon-mots,</HI> or the little plea&s;antries of one company, will not often beat to be told in another; they are frequently local, and take their ri&s;e from certain circum&s;tances; a &s;econd company may not be acquainted with the&s;e circum&s;tances, and of cour&s;e your &s;tory may be mi&s;under&s;tood, or want explaining; and if after you have prefaced it with "I will tell you a good thing," &s;hould the &s;ling not be immediately perceived, you will appear exceedingly ridiculous, and wi&s;h you had not told it. Never then repeat in one company what you hear in another.</P>
<P N="26"><PB N="38" REF="027039_0041_0FD2FA13690DEEF8">
26. In mo&s;t debates, take up the favourable &s;ide of the que&s;tion; however, let me caution you again&s;t being clamorous; that is, never maintain an argument with heat, though you know your&s;elf right; but offer your &s;entiments, mode&s;tly and coolly, and if this does not prevail, give it up, and try to change the &s;ubject by &s;aying &s;omething to this effect; <Q>I find we &s;hall hardly convince one another, neither is there any nece&s;&s;ity to attempt it; &s;o let us talk of &s;omething el&s;e.</Q></P>
<P N="27">27. Not that I would have you give up your opinion always; no, a&s;&s;ert your own &s;entiments, and oppo&s;e tho&s;e of others when wrong, but let your manner and voice be gentle and engaging, and yet no ways affected. If you contradict, do it with <HI>I may be wrong, but&mdash;I won't be po&s;itive, but I really think&mdash;I &s;hould rather &s;uppo&s;e&mdash;If I may be permitted to &s;ay</HI>&mdash;and clo&s;e your di&s;pute with good humour, to &s;how that you are neither di&s;plea&s;ed your&s;elf, nor meant to di&s;plea&s;e the per&s;on you di&s;pute with.</P>
<P N="28">28. Acquaint your&s;elf with the character and &s;ituations of the com|pany you go into, before you give a loo&s;e to your tongue; for &s;hould you enlarge on &s;ome virtue, which any one pre&s;ent may notoriou&s;ly want; or &s;hould you condemn &s;ome vice, which any of the company may be particularly addicted to, they will be apt to think your re|flexions pointed and per&s;onal, and you will be &s;ure to give offence. This con&s;ideration will naturally lead you, not to &s;uppo&s;e things &s;aid in general, to be levelled at you.</P>
<P N="29">29. Low-bred people, when they happen occa&s;ionally to be in good company, imagine them&s;elves to be the &s;ubject of every &s;epa|rate conver&s;ation. If any part of the company whi&s;pers, it is about them; if they laugh, it is at them; and if any thing is &s;aid which they do not comprehend, they immediately &s;uppo&s;e it is meant of them. This mi&s;take is admirably ridiculed in one of our celebrated comedies. "<HI>I am &s;ure,</HI> &s;ays Scrub, <HI>they were talking of me, for they laughed con&s;umedly.</HI>" Now a well-bred per&s;on never thinks him&s;elf di&s;e&s;teemed by the company, or laughed at, unle&s;s their reflexions are &s;o gro&s;s, that he cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to mi&s;take them, and his ho|nour obliges him to re&s;ent it in a proper manner; however, be a&s;&s;ured, gentlemen never laugh at or ridicule one another, unle&s;s they are in joke, or on a footing of the greate&s;t intimacy. If &s;uch a thing &s;hould happen once in an age, from &s;ome pert coxcomb, or &s;ome &s;lippant woman, it is be&s;t not to &s;eem to know it, than to make the lea&s;t reply.</P>
<P N="30">30. It is a piece of politene&s;s not to interrupt a per&s;on in a &s;tory, whether you have heard it before or not. Nay, if a well-bred man is a&s;ked, whether he has heard it, he will an&s;wer no, and let the per&s;on go on, though he knows it already. Some are fond of telling a &s;tory, becau&s;e they think they tell it well, others pride them&s;elves in being the fir&s;t teller of it, and others are plea&s;ed at being thought entru&s;ted with it. Now, all the&s;e per&s;ons you would di&s;appoint, by an&s;wering yes. And, as I have told you before, as the greate&s;t proof of politene&s;s is to make every body happy about you, I would never deprive a per&s;on of any &s;ecret &s;atisfaction of this &s;ort, when I could gratify him by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> attention.</P>
<P N="31">31. Be not a&s;hamed of a&s;king que&s;tions, if &s;uch que&s;tions lead to information; always accompany them with &s;ome excu&s;e, and you never will be reckoned impertinent. But, abrupt que&s;tions, without
<PB N="39" REF="027039_0042_0FD2FA15430B01C8">
&s;ome apology, by all means avoid, as they imply de&s;ign. There is a way of fi&s;hing for facts, which, if done judiciou&s;ly, will an&s;wer every purpo&s;e, &s;uch as taking things you wi&s;h to know for granted; this will perhaps lead &s;ome officious per&s;on to &s;et you right. So again, by &s;aying, you have heard &s;o and &s;o, and &s;ometimes &s;eeming to know more than you do, you will often get an information which you would lo&s;e by direct que&s;tions, as the&s;e would put people on their guard and frequently defeat the very end you aim at.</P>
<P N="32">32. Make it a rule never to reflect on anybody of people, for by this means you will create a number of enemies. There are good and bad of all profe&s;&s;ions, lawyers, &s;oldiers, par&s;ons, or citizens. They are all men, &s;ubject to the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions, differing only in their manner, according to the way they have been bred up in. For this rea&s;on, it is unju&s;t as well as indi&s;creet, to attack them as a <HI>corps</HI> col|lectively Many a young man has thought him&s;elf extremely clever in abu&s;ing the clergy. What are the clergy more than other men? Can you &s;uppo&s;e a black gown can make any alteration in his nature? Fie, fie; think &s;eriou&s;ly, and I am convinced you will never do it.</P>
<P N="33">33. But above all, let no example, no fa&s;hion, no wittici&s;m, no fooli&s;h de&s;ire of ri&s;ing above what knaves call prejudices, tempt you to excu&s;e, extenuate or ridicule the lea&s;t breach of morality, but upon every occa&s;ion, &s;how the greate&s;t abhorrence of &s;uch proceed|ings, and hold virtue and religion in the highe&s;t veneration.</P>
<P N="34">34. It is a great piece of ill-manners to interrupt any one while &s;peaking, by &s;peaking your&s;elf, or calling off the attention of the company to any foreign matter. But this every child knows.</P>
<P N="35">35. The la&s;t thing I &s;hall mention is that of concealing your learn|ing, except on particular occa&s;ions&punc; Re&s;erve this for learned men, and let them rather extort it from you, than you be too willing to di&s;play it. Hence you will be thought mode&s;t, and to have more knowledge than you really have. Never &s;eem wi&s;e, or more learn|ed than the company you are in. He who affects to &s;how his learn|ing, will be frequently que&s;tioned: and if found &s;uperficial, will be &s;neered at; if otherwi&s;e, he will be deemed a pedant. Real merit will always &s;how it&s;elf, and nothing can le&s;&s;en it in the opinion of the world, but a man's exhibiting it him&s;elf.</P>
<P>For God's &s;ake, revolve all the&s;e things &s;eriou&s;ly in your mind, before you go abroad into life. Recollect the ob&s;ervations you have your&s;elf occa&s;ionally made upon men and things, compare them with my in&s;tructions, and act wi&s;ely and con&s;equentially as they &s;hall teach you.</P>

<P>But the wi&s;dom of God is as the light of heaven: he rea&s;oneth not; his mind is the fountain of truth.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tice and mercy wait before his throne; benevolence and love enlighten his countenance forever.</P>
<P>Who is like unto the Lord in glory? Who in power &s;hall contend with the Almighty? Hath he any equal in wi&s;dom? Can any in good|ne&s;s be compared unto him?</P>
<P>He it is, O man! who hath created thee; thy &s;tation on earth is fixed by his appointment: the powers of thy mind are the gifts of his goodne&s;s, the wonders of thy frame are the work of his hand.</P>

<P>Of much &s;peaking cometh repentance, but in &s;ilence is &s;afety.</P>

<P>He hath not &s;uffered his happine&s;s to depend upon her &s;miles, and therefore with her frowns he &s;hall not be di&s;mayed.</P>
<P>As a rock on the &s;ea-&s;hore he &s;tandeth firm, and the da&s;hing of the waves di&s;turbeth him not.</P>

Murmur not therefore at the di&s;pen&s;ations of God, but correct thine own heart: neither &s;ay within thy&s;elf, if I had wealth, or power, or lei&s;ure, I &s;hould be happy; for know they all bring to their &s;everal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors their peculiar inconveniencies.</P>
<P>The poor man &s;eeth not the vexations and anxieties of the rich, he feeleth not the difficulties and perplexities of power, neither knoweth he the weari&s;omene&s;s of lei&s;ure; and therefore it is that he repineth at his own lot.</P>

<P>To be &s;atisfied with a little, is the greate&s;t wi&s;dom; and he who encrea&s;eth his riches, encrea&s;eth his cares: but a content|ed mind is a hidden trea&s;ure, and trouble findeth it not.</P>
<P>Yet if thou &s;uffere&s;t not the allurements of fortune to rob thee of ju&s;tice, or temperance, or charity, or mode&s;ty, even riches them&s;elves &s;hall not make thee unhappy.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. TEMPERANCE.</HEAD>

<P>Shame followeth, and di&s;ea&s;e, and want, and care, and re|pentance.</P>
<P>Enfeebled by dalliance, with luxury pampered, and &s;oftened by &s;loth, &s;trength &s;hall for&s;ake thy limbs, and health thy con&s;ti|tution. Thy days &s;hall be few, and tho&s;e inglorious; thy griefs &s;hall be many, yet meet with no compa&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>He is not embarra&s;&s;ed with a train of dependants, nor tea&s;ed with the clamours of &s;olicitation.</P>
<P>Debarred from the dainties of the rich, he e&s;capeth al&s;o their di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>The bread he eateth, is it not &s;weet to his ta&s;te? the water he drinketh, is it not plea&s;ant to his thir&s;t? yea, far more delicious than the riche&s;t draughts of the luxurious.</P>
<P>His labour pre&s;erveth his health, and produceth him a repo&s;e, to which the downy bed of &s;loth is a &s;tranger.</P>
<P>He limiteth his de&s;ires with humility; and the calm of contentment is &s;weeter to his &s;oul, than the acquirements of wealth and grandeur.</P>
<P>Let not the rich therefore pre&s;ume on his riches, nor the poor de|&s;pond in his poverty; for the providence of God di&s;pen&s;eth happi|ne&s;s to them both, and the di&s;tribution thereof is more equally made than the fool can believe.</P>

<P>REPINE not, O man! at the &s;tate of &s;ervitude: It is the ap|pointment of God, and hath many advantages; it removeth thee from the cares and &s;olicitudes of life.</P>

<P>Thy &s;oul is the monarch of thy frame; &s;uffer not its &s;ubjects to re|bel again&s;t it.</P>
<P>The body is as the globe of the earth, thy bones the pillars that &s;u&s;tain it on its ba&s;is.</P>
<P>As the ocean giveth ri&s;e to &s;prings, who&s;e waters return again into its bo&s;om through the rivers; &s;o runneth thy life from the heart out|wards, and &s;o returneth it unto its place again.</P>
<P>Do not both retain their cour&s;e for ever? Behold! the &s;ame God ordained them.</P>
<P>Is not thy no&s;e the channel to perfumes? thy mouth the path to delicacies? Yet know thou, that perfumes long &s;melt become offen|&s;ive; that delicacies de&s;troy the appetite they flatter.</P>
<P>Are not thine eyes the centinels that watch for thee? yet how often are they unable to di&s;tingui&s;h truth from error?</P>
<P>Keep thy &s;oul in moderation, teach thy &s;pirit to be attentive to its good; &s;o &s;hall the&s;e, its mini&s;ters, be always to thee conveyances of truth.</P>
<P>Thine hand, is it not a miracle? Is there in the creation aught like unto it? wherefore was it given thee, but that thou mighte&s;t &s;tretch it out to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of thy brother?</P>
<P>Why of all things living art thou alone made capable of blu&s;hing? The world &s;hall read thy &s;hame upon thy face; therefore do nothing &s;hameful.</P>
<P>Fear and di&s;may, why rob they thy countenance of its ruddy &s;plendor? Avoid guilt, and thou &s;halt know that fear is beneath thee; that di&s;may is unmanly.</P>
<P>Wherefore to thee alone &s;peak &s;hadows in the vi&s;ions of thy pillow? Reverence them; for, know that dreams are from on high.</P>
<P>Thou, man, alone can&s;t &s;peak. Wonder at the glorious preroga|tive; and pay to him who gave it thee, a rational and welcome prai&s;e, teaching thy children wi&s;dom, in&s;tructing the offspring of thy loins in piety.</P>

That thou ha&s;t a &s;oul, is of all knowledge the mo&s;t certain, of all truths the mo&s;t plain unto thee. Be meek, be grateful for it. Seek not to know it perfectly. It is in&s;crutable.</P>
<P>Thinking, under&s;tanding, rea&s;oning, willing, call not the&s;e the &s;oul. They are its actions, but they are not its e&s;&s;ence.</P>
<P>Rai&s;e it not too high, that thou be not de&s;pi&s;ed. Be not thou like unto tho&s;e that fall by climbing, neither deba&s;e it to the &s;en&s;e of brutes; nor be thou like to the hor&s;e and the mule, in whom there is no under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Search it by its faculties, know it by its virtues. They are more in number than the hairs of thy head; the &s;tars of Hea|ven are not to be counted with them.</P>
<P>Think not with Arabia, that one &s;oul is parted among all men; neither believe thou with the &s;ons of Egypt, that every man hath many: know that as thy heart, &s;o al&s;o thy &s;oul is one.</P>

<P>She is immortal; &s;he is unchangeable; &s;he is alike in all. Health called her forth to &s;how her loveline&s;s, and application annointeth her with the oil of wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>Although &s;he &s;hall live after thee, think not &s;he was born be|fore thee. She was concreted with thy fle&s;h, and formed with thy brain.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tice could not give her to thee exalted by virtues, nor mercy deliver her to thee deformed by vices. The&s;e mu&s;t be thine, and thou mu&s;t an&s;wer them.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e not death can &s;hield thee from examination; think not corruption can hide thee from enquiry. He who formed thee of thou knowe&s;t not what, can he not rai&s;e thee from thou knowe&s;t not what again?</P>
<P>Perceiveth not the cock the hour of midnight? Exalteth he not his voice, to tell thee it is morning?

<P>Envy not the&s;e of their &s;en&s;es, becau&s;e quicker than thine own. Learn that the advantage lieth not in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing good things, but in knowing to u&s;e them.</P>

<P>Hath any one of them the gift of &s;peech? Can any &s;ay unto thee, Therefore did I &s;o?</P>

<P>Remember thou its dignity for ever; forget not how great a talent is committed to thy charge.</P>
<P>What&s;oever may do good, may al&s;o do harm. Beware that thou direct its cour&s;e to virtue.</P>

<P>Tho' bright, it dazzleth not; tho' ob&s;cure, it di&s;plea&s;eth not; tho' &s;weet, it cloyeth not; tho' corrupt, it forbiddeth not: Yet who is he that knoweth its true value?</P>
<P>Learn to e&s;teem life as it ought; then art thou near the pinnacle of wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>Think not with the fool, that nothing is more valuable; nor be|lieve with the pretended wi&s;e, that thou oughte&s;t to contemn it. Love it not for it&s;elf, but for the good it may be of to others.</P>
<P>Gold cannot buy it for thee, neither can mines of diamonds pur|cha&s;e back the moment thou ha&s;t now lo&s;t of it. Employ the &s;ucceed|ing ones in virtue.</P>
<P>Say not, that it were be&s;t not to have been born; or, if born, that it had been be&s;t to die early: Neither dare thou to a&s;k of thy Creator, where had been the evil, had I not exi&s;ted? Good is in thy power;
<PB N="66" REF="027039_0069_0FD2FA5A902E0378">
the want of good is evil; and, if thy que&s;tion be ju&s;t, lo! it con|demneth thee.</P>
<P>Would the fi&s;h &s;wallow the bait, if he knew the hook was hid therein? would the lion enter the toils, if he knew they were pre|pared for him? So neither, were the &s;oul to peri&s;h with this clay, would man wi&s;h to live; neither would a merciful God have created him: Know hence thou &s;halt live afterward.</P>

<P>Though its ways are uneven, yet are they not all painful? Accom|modate thy&s;elf to all; and where there is lea&s;t appearance of evil, &s;u&s;pect the greate&s;t danger.</P>
<P>When thy bed is &s;traw, thou &s;leepe&s;t in &s;ecurity; but when thou ha&s;t &s;tretched thy&s;elf on ro&s;es, beware of the thorns.</P>
<P>A good death is better than an evil life: Strive to live, therefore, as long as thou oughte&s;t, not as long as thou can&s;t.</P>
<P>While thy life is to others worth more than thy death, it is thy duty to pre&s;erve it.</P>
<P>Complain not, with the fool, of the &s;hortne&s;s of thy time: Re|member, that with thy days, thy cares are &s;hortened.</P>
<P>Take from the period of thy life the u&s;ele&s;s parts of it, and what remaineth? Take off the time of thine infancy, the &s;econd infancy of age, thy &s;leep, thy thoughtle&s;s hours, thy days of &s;ickne&s;s; and, even at the fulne&s;s of years, how few &s;ea&s;ons ha&s;t thou truly num|bered?</P>
<P>He who gave thee life as a ble&s;&s;ing, &s;hortened it to make it more &s;o. To what end would longer life have &s;erved thee? Wi&s;he&s;t thou to have had an opportunity of more vices? As to the good, will not he who limited thy &s;pan, be &s;atisfied with the fruits of it?</P>
<P>To what end, O child of &s;orrow! would&s;t thou live longer? To breathe, to eat, to &s;ee the world? All this thou ha&s;t done often al|ready. Too frequent repetition, is it not tire&s;ome? or is it not &s;u|perfluous?</P>
<P>Woulde&s;t thou improve thy wi&s;dom and thy virtue? Alas! what art thou to know? or who is it that &s;hall teach thee? Badly thou em|ploye&s;t the little thou ha&s;t? Dare not therefore to complain that more is not given thee.</P>
<P>Repine not at the want of knowledge; it mu&s;t peri&s;h with thee in the grave. Be hone&s;t here, thou &s;halt be wi&s;e hereafter.</P>
<P>Say not unto the crow, Why numbere&s;t thou &s;even times the age of thy lord? or to the fawn, Why are thine eyes to &s;ee my offspring to an hundred generations? Are the&s;e to be compared with thee in the abu&s;e of life? are they riotous? are they cruel? are they ungrate|ful?

<P>Knowe&s;t thou to employ life better than the&s;e? then le&s;s of it may &s;uffice thee.</P>

<P>Is it not a &s;cene of delu&s;ion, a &s;eries of mi&s;adventure, a pur&s;uit of evils linked on all &s;ides together?

<P>What part of life is it that we would wi&s;h to remain with us? Is it youth? Can we be in love with outrage, licentiou&s;ne&s;s and teme|rity? Is it age? then are we fond of infirmities.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, grey hairs are revered, and in length of days is honour. Virtue can add reverence to the bloom of youth; and without it, age plants more wrinkles in the &s;oul than on the forehead.</P>
<P>Is age re&s;pected becau&s;e it hateth riot? What ju&s;tice is in this, when it is not age de&s;pi&s;eth plea&s;ure, but plea&s;ure that de&s;pi&s;eth age?</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. WEAKNESS.</HEAD>
<P>VAIN and incon&s;tant as thou art, O child of imperfection! How can&s;t thou but be weak? Is not incon&s;tancy connected with frailty? Can there be vanity without infirmity? Avoid the danger of the one, and thou &s;halt e&s;cape the mi&s;chiefs of the other.</P>
<P>Wherein art thou mo&s;t weak? In that wherein thou &s;eeme&s;t mo&s;t &s;trong; in that wherein mo&s;t thou glorie&s;t; even in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the things which thou ha&s;t; in u&s;ing the good that is about thee.</P>
<P>Are not thy de&s;ires al&s;o frail? or knowe&s;t thou even what it is thou woulde&s;t wi&s;h? When thou ha&s;t obtained what mo&s;t thou &s;oughte&s;t after, behold it contenteth thee not.</P>
<P>Wherefore lo&s;eth the plea&s;ure that is before thee, its reli&s;h? and why appeareth that which is yet to come, the &s;weeter? Becau&s;e thou art wearied with the good of this, becau&s;e thou knowe&s;t not the evil of that which is not with thee. Know, that to be content, is to be happy.</P>
<P>Could&s;t thou chu&s;e for thy&s;elf, would thy Creator lay before thee all that thine heart could a&s;k for? Would happine&s;s then remain with thee? Or would joy dwell always in thy gates?</P>
<P>Alas! thy weakne&s;s forbiddeth it; thy infirmity declareth again&s;t it. Variety is to thee in the place of plea&s;ure; but that which per|manently delighteth, mu&s;t be permanent.</P>
<P>When it is gone, thou repente&s;t the lo&s;s of it; though, while it was with thee, thou de&s;pi&s;ed&s;t it.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="027039_0074_0FD2FA65397B7058">
That which &s;ucceedeth it, hath no more plea&s;ure for thee; and thou afterwards quarrele&s;t with thy&s;elf for preferring it: Behold the only circum&s;tance in which thou erre&s;t not!</P>
<P>Is there any thing in which thy weakne&s;s appeareth more than in de&s;iring things? It is in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, and in the u&s;ing them.</P>
<P>Good things cea&s;e to be good in our enjoyment of them. What nature meant pure &s;weets, are &s;ources of bitterne&s;s to us; from our delights ari&s;e pain, from our joys, &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Be moderate in the enjoyment, and it &s;hall remain in thy po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion: let thy joys be founded on rea&s;on, and to its end &s;hall &s;orrow be a &s;tranger.</P>
<P>The delights of love are u&s;hered in by &s;ighs, and they terminate in langui&s;hment and dejection. The object thou burned&s;t for, nau|&s;eates with &s;atiety, and no &s;ooner had&s;t thou po&s;&s;e&s;t it, but thou wert weary of its pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Join e&s;teem to thy admiration, unite friend&s;hip with thy love; &s;o &s;halt thou find, in the end, content &s;o ab&s;olute, that it &s;urpa&s;&s;eth rap|tures, tranquillity more worth than ec&s;ta&s;y.</P>
<P>God hath given thee no good without its admixture of evil; but he hath given thee al&s;o the means of throwing off the evil from it.</P>
<P>As joy is not without its allay of pain, &s;o neither is &s;orrow with|out its portion of plea&s;ure. Joy and grief, though unlike, are united. Our own choice only can give them to us entire.</P>
<P>Melancholy it&s;elf often giveth delight, and the extremity of joy is mingled with tears.</P>
<P>The be&s;t things in the hands of a fool may be turned to his de&s;truc|tion; and out of the wor&s;t the wi&s;e will find the means of good.</P>
<P>So blended is weakne&s;s in thy nature, O man! that thou ha&s;t not &s;trength either to be good, or to be evil entirely. Rejoice that thou can&s;t not excel in evil, and let the good that is within thy reach con|tent thee.</P>
<P>The virtues are allotted to various &s;tations. Seek not after impo&s;|&s;ibilities, nor grieve that thou can&s;t not po&s;&s;e&s;s them all.</P>
<P>Would&s;t thou at once have the liberality of the rich, and the con|tentment of the poor? or &s;hould the wife of thy bo&s;om be de&s;pi&s;ed, becau&s;e &s;he &s;heweth not the virtues of the widow?</P>
<P>If thy father &s;ink before thee in the divi&s;ions of thy country, can at once thy ju&s;tice de&s;troy him, and thy duty &s;ave his life?</P>
<P>If thou behold thy brother in the agonies of a &s;low death, is it not mercy to put a period to his life? and is it not al&s;o he who takes away his life his murderer?</P>
<P>Truth is but one; thy doubts are of thine own rai&s;ing. He who made virtues what they are, planted al&s;o in thee a knowledge of their pre-eminence. Act as thy &s;oul dictates to thee, and the end &s;hall be always right.</P>

<P>But be wi&s;e, O ruler! and learn, O thou that art to command the national one crime authori&s;ed by thee, is wor&s;e than the e&s;cape of ten from puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>When thy people are numerous, when thy &s;ons encrea&s;e about thy table, &s;ende&s;t thou them not out to &s;lay the innocent, and to fall be|fore the &s;word of him whom they have not offended?</P>
<P>If the object of thy de&s;ires demandeth the lives of a thou&s;and, &s;aye&s;t thou not, I will have it? Surely thou forgette&s;t, that he who created thee, created al&s;o the&s;e; and that their blood is as rich as thine.</P>
<P>Saye&s;t thou, that ju&s;tice cannot be executed without wrong? Sure|ly thine own words condemn thee.</P>
<P>Thou who flattere&s;t with fal&s;e hopes the criminal, that he may confe&s;s his guilt, art not thou unto him a criminal? or is thy guilt the le&s;s, becau&s;e he cannot puni&s;h it?</P>
<P>When thou commande&s;t to the torture, him who is but &s;u&s;pected of ill, dare&s;t thou to remember, that thou maye&s;t wreck the innocent?</P>
<P>Is thy purpo&s;e an&s;wered by the event? is thy &s;oul &s;atisfied with his confe&s;&s;ion? Pain will enforce him to &s;ay what is not, as ea&s;ily as what is; and angui&s;h hath cau&s;ed innocence to accu&s;e her&s;elf.</P>

<P>The way to her is labour; attention is the pilot that mu&s;t conduct thee into her ports. But weary not in the way; for when thou art arrived at her, the toil &s;hall be to thee for plea|&s;ure.</P>

<P>Would thou &s;ee thine in&s;ufficiency more plainly, view thy&s;elf at thy devotions. To what end was religion in&s;tituted, but to teach thee thine infirmities; to remind thee of thy weak|ne&s;s, to &s;how thee that from Heaven alone thou art to hope for good?</P>

<P>Learn to be ju&s;t, and repentance may be forgotten: learn to be hone&s;t, and oaths are unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. REVENGE.</HEAD>
<P>THE root of revenge, is in the weakne&s;s of the &s;oul: the mo&s;t abject and timorous, are the mo&s;t addicted to it.</P>
<P>Who torture tho&s;e they hate, but cowards? who murder tho&s;e they rob, but the ba&s;e and timid?</P>
<P>The feeling an injury, mu&s;t be previous to the revenging it: but the noble mind di&s;daineth to &s;ay it hurts me.</P>
<P>If the injury is not below thy notice, he that doth it unto thee, in that maketh him&s;elf &s;o: would&s;t thou enter the lifts with thine inferior?</P>
<P>Requite with kindne&s;s the man who attempteth to wrong thee: do good to him who would give thee di&s;quiet.</P>
<P>In this thou not only pre&s;erve&s;t thine own peace, but thou in|flicte&s;t puni&s;hment, without &s;tooping to employ revenge again&s;t him.</P>
<P>As the tempe&s;t and the thunder affect not the &s;un or the &s;tars, but &s;pend their fury on &s;tones and trees below; &s;o injuries a&s;cend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to the &s;ouls of the great, but wa&s;te them&s;elves on &s;uch as tho&s;e are who offer them.</P>
<P>Poorne&s;s of &s;pirit will actuate revenge; greatne&s;s of &s;oul de&s;pi&s;|eth the offence: nay, it doth good unto him who intended to have di&s;turbed it.</P>
<P>Why &s;eeke&s;t thou vengeance, O man! with what purpo&s;e is it that thou pur&s;ue&s;t it? Thinke&s;t thou to pain thine adver&s;ary by it? Know, that thy&s;elf feele&s;t its greate&s;t torment.</P>
<P>Revenge knaweth the heart of him who is infected with it; while he again&s;t whom it is intended, remaineth ea&s;y.</P>
<P>It is unju&s;t in the angui&s;h it inflicts; therefore nature intended it not for thee: needeth he who is injured, more pain&punc; or ought he to add force to the affliction which another hath ca&s;t upon him?</P>
<P>The man who meditateth revenge, is not content with the mi&s;|chief he hath received, he addeth to his angui&s;h the puni&s;hment due unto another: while he whom he &s;eeketh to hurt, goeth his
<PB N="81" REF="027039_0083_0FD2FA82519B7A10">
way laughing; he maketh him&s;elf merry at this addition to his mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Revenge is painful in the intent, and it is dangerous in the execu|tion: &s;eldom doth the axe fall, where he who lifteth it up intend|ed; and lo! he remembereth not that it mu&s;t recoil again&s;t him&s;elf.</P>
<P>While the revengeful &s;eeketh his enemy's hurt, be oftentimes procureth his own de&s;truction; while he aimeth at one of the eyes of his adver&s;ary, lo! he putteth out both his own.</P>
<P>If he attain not his end, he lamenteth it; if he &s;ucceed, he re|penteth of it; the fear of ju&s;tice taketh away the peace of his own &s;oul; the care to hide him from it, de&s;troyeth that of his friend.</P>
<P>Can the death of thine adver&s;ary &s;atiate thy hatred? Can the &s;et|ting him at re&s;t re&s;tore thy peace?</P>
<P>Would&s;t thou make him &s;orry for the offence, conquer him, by &s;paring him; In death he owneth not thy &s;uperiority; nor feeleth he any more the power of thy wrath.</P>
<P>In revenge, there &s;hould be a triumph of the avenger; and he who hath injured him, &s;hould feel his di&s;plea&s;ure; he &s;hould &s;uffer pain from it, and &s;hould repent him of the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>This is the revenge in&s;pired from anger; but that which makes thee greater, is to repay injuries with kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>Murder for injury, ari&s;eth only from cowardice: He who inflict|eth it &s;careth that the enemy may live, and avenge him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Death endeth the quarrel; but it re&s;toreth not the reputation: Kil|ling is an act of caution, not of courage; it is &s;afe, but it is not ho|nourable.</P>
<P>There is nothing &s;o ea&s;y as to revenge an offence, but nothing is &s;o honourable as to pardon it.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t victory man can obtain, is over him&s;elf: He that di&s;|daineth to feel an injury, retorteth it upon him who offereth it.</P>
<P>When thou meditate&s;t revenge, thou confe&s;&s;e&s;t that thou feele&s;t the wrong; when thou complaine&s;t, thou acknowledge&s;t thy&s;elf hurt by it: Meane&s;t thou to add this triumph to the pride of thine enemy?</P>
<P>That cannot be an injury which is not felt: how then can he who de&s;pi&s;eth it revenge it?</P>
<P>If thou think it di&s;honourable to bear an offence, more is in thy power; thou maye&s;t conquer it.</P>
<P>Good offices will make a man a&s;hamed to be thine enemy; great|ne&s;s of &s;oul will terrify him from the thought of hurting thee.</P>
<P>The greater the wrong, the more glory is in pardoning it: and by how much the more ju&s;tifiable would be revenge, by &s;o much the more honour is in clemency.</P>
<P>Ha&s;t thou a right to be a judge in thine own cau&s;e; to be a party in the act, and yet to pronounce &s;entence on it? Before thou con|demne&s;t, let another &s;ay it is ju&s;t.</P>
<P>The revengeful is feared, and therefore he is hated; but he that is endued with clemency, is adored: The prai&s;e of his actions remain|eth for ever; and the love of the world attendeth him.</P>

<P>The favour of princes may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ught by rank and vices: titles may be purcha&s;ed for money: but the&s;e are not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> honour.</P>
<P>Crimes cannot exalt the man who commits the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> to real glory: neither can gold make men noble.</P>

<P>Would&s;t thou wi&s;h to be rai&s;ed for men know not what? or would&s;t thou that they &s;hould &s;ay, why in this?</P>
<P>When the virtues of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> de&s;cend to his children, his tit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">es accompany them well: but when he who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth them is unlike unto him who de&s;erved them, lo! do they not call him degene|rate?</P>
<P>Hereditary honour is accounted the mo&s;t noble; but rea&s;on &s;peak|eth in the cau&s;e of him who hath acquired it.</P>
<P>He who, m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">le&s;s him&s;elf, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to the actions of his an|ce&s;tors for his greatne&s;s, is like the thief who claimeth protection by flying to the pagod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>

<P>A mind di&s;po&s;ed to virtue maketh great the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of it; and without titles, it will rai&s;e him above the vulgar.</P>
<P>He will acquire honour, while others receive it; and will he not &s;ay unto them, Such were the man whom you glory in being derived from?</P>
<P>As the &s;hadow waiteth on the &s;ub&s;tance, even &s;o true honour at|tendeth on virtue.</P>
<P>Say not that honour is the child of boldne&s;s, nor believe thou that the hazard of life alone can pay the price of it: it is not to the action that it is due, but to the manner of performing it.</P>

<P>He that is truely virtuous, loveth virtue for her&s;elf: he di&s;daineth the applau&s;e which ambition aimeth after.</P>
<P>How pitiable were the &s;tate of virtue, if &s;he could not be happy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> another's prai&s;e? She is too noble to &s;eek recompence, and no more will, than can be rewarded.</P>

<P N="5">5. The duration of our pa&s;&s;ions no more depends on us, than the duration of our lives.</P>
<P N="6">6. Pa&s;&s;ion often makes a man of &s;en&s;e mad; and often makes a fool &s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P N="7">7. Tho&s;e great and &s;hining actions, who&s;e lu&s;tre even dazzles us, we repre&s;ented by the politicians as the effects of great de&s;igns: whereas, for the mo&s;t part, they are indeed the effects of humour and pa&s;&s;ion: thus the war between <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> and <HI>Antony,</HI> which is attributed to the ambition each had of making him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the world, was perhaps nothing but the effect of jealou&s;y.</P>
<P N="8">8. The pa&s;&s;ions are the only orators that are always &s;ure to per|&s;uade: they are, as it were, nature's art of eloquence, the rules of which are infallible: and the plaine&s;t man with pa&s;&s;ion, per&s;uades more than the mo&s;t eloquent without it.</P>
<P N="9">9. There is &s;uch an inherent inju&s;tice and &s;elf-intere&s;t in the pa&s;|&s;ions, that it is dangerous to follow them, and they are mo&s;t to be di&s;tru&s;ted, even when they appear to be mo&s;t rea&s;onable.</P>
<P N="10">10. There is in the heart of man a perpetual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of pa&s;|&s;ions, in&s;omuch, that the ruin of one is almo&s;t always the ri&s;e of another.</P>
<P N="11">11. The pa&s;&s;ions often beget other pa&s;&s;ions of a quite contrary nature; avarice &s;ometimes produces prodigality, and prodigality avarice: weakne&s;s often makes a man re&s;olute, and fear, bold.</P>
<P N="12">12. For all the care we ake to conceal our pa&s;&s;ions under the veil of religion and honour, they always appear through the di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P N="13"><PB N="92" REF="027039_0095_0FD2FAAE44A24F50">
13. Our &s;elf-love bears more impatiently the condemnation of our inclinations than of our opinions</P>
<P N="14">14. Men are not only apt to forget kindne&s;&s;es and injuries, but even to hate tho&s;e who have obliged them, and to cea&s;e to hate tho&s;e who have u&s;ed them ill. The trouble of returning favours and re|venging wrongs, &s;eems a &s;lavery to them, which they do not ea&s;ily &s;ubmit to.</P>
<P N="15">15. The clemency of princes is often nothing but a piece of policy to gain the affections of their &s;ubjects.</P>
<P N="16">16. That clemency which is cried up as a virtue, is practi&s;ed &s;ometimes out of vanity, &s;ometimes out of lazine&s;s, often out of fear, and almo&s;t always out of a mixture of all three together.</P>
<P N="17">17. The moderation of per&s;ons in pro&s;perity proceeds from the calm that good fortune gives to their humour and temper.</P>
<P N="18">18. Moderation is a fear of falling into that envy and contempt, which tho&s;e de&s;erve that are intoxicated with their good fortune: it is a vain o&s;tentation of the force of our mind: and, in &s;hort, the moderation of men, in their mo&s;t exalted condition, is a de&s;ire of appearing greater than their fortune.</P>
<P N="19">19. We have all of us &s;trength enough to bear the misfortunes of other people.</P>
<P N="20">20. The con&s;tancy of the wi&s;e is no more than the art of con|fining their troubles to their own brea&s;ts.</P>
<P N="21">21. Criminals, when led to execution, affect &s;ometimes a con|&s;tancy and a contempt of death, which, in truth, is nothing but a fear to look it in the face: &s;o that this con&s;tancy and this contempt may be &s;aid to be to their mind, what the handkerchief is to their eyes.</P>
<P N="22">22. Philo&s;ophy makes nothing to triumph over pa&s;t and future evils, but the pre&s;ent triumph over that.</P>
<P N="23">23. Few people are acquainted with death: they generally &s;ubmit to it, not out of re&s;olution, but in&s;en&s;ibility and cu&s;tom; and the greate&s;t part of men die, only becau&s;e they cannot avoid dying.</P>
<P N="24">24. When great men are dejected with the length of their mis|fortunes, they di&s;cover that it was the force of their ambition, and not of their &s;oul, that &s;u&s;taineth them: and that, bating a great va|nity, heroes are made ju&s;t like other men.</P>
<P N="25">25 Greater virtues are required to bear a good fortune than an ill one.</P>
<P N="26">26. The &s;un and death are two things that cannot &s;teadily be look|ed on.</P>
<P N="27">27. Men are often vain even of the mo&s;t criminal pa&s;&s;ions; but, envy is a cowardly and &s;hameful pa&s;&s;ion, which nobody ever dares to own.</P>
<P N="28">28. Jealou&s;y is in &s;ome &s;ort ju&s;t and rea&s;onable, &s;ince it only tends to pre&s;erve a good which belongs to us, or which we believe does belong to us: whereas envy is a madne&s;s that cannot bear the good of others.</P>
<P N="29">29. The ill we do, expo&s;es us, not &s;o much to per&s;ecution and hatred, as our good qualities.</P>
<P N="30">30. We have more power than will; and it is often to excu&s;e

our&s;elves to our&s;elves, that we fancy things impo&s;&s;ible to be ef|fected.</P>
<P N="31">31. If we had no defects of our own, we &s;hould not take &s;o much plea&s;ure as we do, to remark defects in others.</P>
<P N="32">32. Jealou&s;y is fed by doubts, and either becomes madne&s;s, or cea&s;es, as &s;oon as doubt is turned into certainty.</P>
<P N="33">33. Pride always indemnifies it&s;elf one way or other, and lo&s;es nothing, even when it renounces vanity.</P>
<P N="34">34. If we were not proud our&s;elves, we &s;hould not complain of the pride of others.</P>
<P N="35">35. Pride is equal in all men, and the difference is only in the means and the manner of &s;howing it.</P>
<P N="36">36. Nature, who &s;o wi&s;ely has fitted the organs of our body to make us happy, &s;eems likewi&s;e to have be&s;towed pride on us, on purpo&s;e, as it were, to &s;ave us the pain of knowing our imperfec|tions.</P>
<P N="37">37. Pride has a greater &s;hare than good nature, in our reprehend|ing people for their faults; and we reprove them not &s;o much to amend them, as to make them believe we are free from tho&s;e faults our&s;elves.</P>
<P N="38">38. We make promi&s;es according to our hopes, and keep them according to our fears.</P>
<P N="39">39. Intere&s;t &s;peaks all &s;orts of languages, and acts all &s;orts of parts, even that of the di&s;intere&s;ted per&s;on.</P>
<P N="40">40. Intere&s;t, which blinds &s;ome people, enlightens others.</P>
<P N="41">41. The men that apply them&s;elves too much to little things, commonly become incapable of great.</P>
<P N="42">42. We have not &s;trength enough to follow all the dictates of our rea&s;on.</P>
<P N="43">43. Man often fancies he governs him&s;elf when he is governed: and while he, with his under&s;tanding, aims at one mark, his affecti|ons in&s;en&s;ibly carry him off to another.</P>
<P N="44">44. Strength and weakne&s;s of mind are improper terms; they are, in reality, nothing but the good or ill di&s;po&s;ition of the organs of our body.</P>
<P N="45">45. The caprice of our humour is more fanta&s;tical even than that of fortune.</P>
<P N="46">46. The fondne&s;s or indifference which the philo&s;ophers had for life, was nothing but a reli&s;h of &s;elf-love, which ought no more to be di&s;puted, than the reli&s;h of the palate, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the choice of colour.</P>
<P N="47">47. 'Tis our humour which &s;ets the price on all the things which we receive from fortune.</P>
<P N="48">48. Happine&s;s is in the ta&s;te, and not in the things; and it is a man's having that which he loves that makes him happy, and not what others think lovely.</P>
<P N="49">49. We are never &s;o happy, or unhappy, as we imagine.</P>
<P N="50">50. Tho&s;e who are conceited of their merit, take a pride in be|ing unhappy, that they make others and them&s;elves believe, they are worthy to be the mark of fortune.</P>
<P N="51">51. Nothing ought &s;o much to le&s;&s;en the &s;atisfaction we take in our&s;elves, as to &s;ee that we di&s;approve at one time, what we ap|proved at another.</P>
<P N="52">52. Whatever difference there may appear to be in men's fortunes,
<PB N="94" REF="027039_0097_0FD2FAB1C6ECD3C0">
there is &s;till a certain compen&s;ation of good and ill in all, that makes them equal.</P>
<P N="53">53. Let nature give never &s;o may advantages, 'tis not &s;he alone, but fortune in conjunction with her, that makes a hero.</P>
<P N="54">54. The contempt of riches was, in the philo&s;ophers, a &s;ecret de|&s;ire to revenge on fortune the inju&s;tice &s;he had done to their merit, by de&s;pi&s;ing tho&s;e goods which &s;he had denied them: 'twas an art to &s;ecure them&s;elves from the di&s;grace of poverty; 'twas a by-way to arrive at e&s;teem, which they could not come at by the ordinary one of riches.</P>
<P N="55">55. Our hatred of favourites, is nothing but our love of favour: the indignation we conceive at our not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it our&s;elves, is &s;oothed and &s;oftened by the contempt we expre&s;s for tho&s;e who do po&s;&s;e&s;s it; and we refu&s;e them our re&s;pect, not being able to deprive them of that which procures them the re&s;pect of all the world.</P>
<P N="56">56. To make a fortune in the world, men u&s;e all the means po&s;&s;i|ble to appear to have made it already.</P>
<P N="57">57. Tho' men value them&s;elves on their great actions, they are not often the effects of a great de&s;ign, but the effects of chance.</P>
<P N="58">58. Our actions &s;eem to have their lucky and unlucky &s;tars, to which is owing a great part of the prai&s;e or di&s;prai&s;e which is gives them.</P>
<P N="59">59. There is no accident &s;o unfortunate but the prudent will make &s;ome advantage of it; nor any &s;o fortunate that the imprudent will not turn to their prejudice.</P>
<P N="60">60. Fortune turns every thing to the advantage of tho&s;e &s;he fa|vours.</P>
<P N="61">61. The happine&s;s and unhappine&s;s of men depend no le&s;s on their humour, than on fortune.</P>
<P N="62">62. Sincerity is an openne&s;s of heart: it is found in very few peo|ple; and that which we &s;ee commonly, is not it, but a &s;ubtle di&s;&s;i|mulation to gain the confidence of others.</P>
<P N="63">63. Our aver&s;ion to lying, is often an imperceptible ambition of making our affirmations con&s;iderable, and of procuring our affec|tions to be entertained with a religious re&s;pect.</P>
<P N="64">64. Truth does not &s;o much good in the world, as its appear|ances do mi&s;chief.</P>
<P N="65">65. No encomiums are thought too great for prudence, yet it cannot in&s;ure as the lea&s;t event.</P>
<P N="66">66. A man of &s;en&s;e and ability, ought to a&s;&s;ign to his &s;everal in|tere&s;ts, their proper place, and to pur&s;ue them in their order; but this order our greedine&s;s often di&s;turbs&mdash;putting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s on running after &s;o many things at once, that, too de&s;irous of the le&s;s important, we mi&s;s the more con&s;iderable.</P>
<P N="67">67. A good grace is to the body, what good &s;en&s;e is to the mind.</P>
<P N="68">68. It is hard to define love: all that can be &s;aid of it is, that in the &s;oul, it is a lu&s;t of power; in the &s;pirits, it is a &s;ympathy; and in the body, it is nothing but a &s;ecret and delicate de&s;ire of enjoy|ment after a great many difficulties.</P>
<P N="69">69. If there is &s;uch a thing as love, pure and free from any mix+ture of our other pa&s;&s;ions, it is that love which lies concealed at the bottom of the heart, and is not known even to our&s;elves.</P>
<P N="70"><PB N="95" REF="027039_0098_0FD2FAB3F776BEE8">
70. There is no di&s;gui&s;e which can long conceal love where it is, or feign it, where it is not.</P>
<P N="71">71. There are a few people but are a&s;hamed that they ever loved one another, when they love one another no longer.</P>
<P N="72">72. To judge of love by mo&s;t of its effects, one would think it was more like hatred than kindne&s;s.</P>
<P N="73">73. There are &s;ome women to be found, that never had an in|trigue, but rarely any to be &s;ound, that never had but one.</P>
<P N="74">74. There is no more than one &s;ort of love, but there are a thou|&s;and different copies of it.</P>
<P N="75">75. Love can, no more than fire, &s;ub&s;i&s;t without a continual mo|tion; the minute it cea&s;es to hope or fear, it cea&s;es to live.</P>
<P N="76">76. It is with true love as with apparitions&mdash;a thing every body talks of, but few have &s;een.</P>
<P N="77">77. Love lends his name to many a corre&s;pondence which is at|tributed to him, in which he has no more &s;hare than the dog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> has in what is tran&s;acted at <HI>Venice.</HI></P>
<P N="78">78. The love of ju&s;tice, in mo&s;t men, is nothing but a fear of &s;uf|fering by inju&s;tice.</P>
<P N="79">79. Silence is the &s;afe&s;t cour&s;e for the man that di&s;tru&s;ts him&s;elf.</P>
<P N="80">80. The thing that makes us &s;o changeable in our friend&s;hips is, that 'tis difficult to know the qualities of the &s;oul, and ea&s;y to know tho&s;e of the under&s;tanding.</P>
<P N="81">81. We cannot love any thing but with a regard to our&s;elves; and we do but pur&s;ue our inclination at plea&s;ure, when we prefer our friends to our&s;elves; yet, 'tis this preference alone, that can make our friend&s;hips &s;incere and perfect.</P>
<P N="82">82. Our reconciliation with our enemies, is nothing but a de&s;ire of bettering our condition, a wearine&s;s of the &s;tate of war, and a fear of &s;ome mi&s;chievous event.</P>
<P N="83">83. The thing which men call friend&s;hip, is nothing but partner|&s;hip, a mutual regard to their &s;everal intere&s;ts, and an exchange of good offices; it is, in &s;hort, nothing but a trafic, in which &s;elf-love always propo&s;es to it&s;elf in &s;omething or other to be a gainer.</P>
<P N="84">84. 'Tis more di&s;honourable to di&s;tru&s;t our friends, than to be de|ceived by them.</P>
<P N="85">85. We often fancy that we love the per&s;ons that are greater in power than our&s;elves, when it is intere&s;t alone that is the cau&s;e of this kindne&s;s. We devote not our&s;elves to them for the good we de|&s;ire to do them, but for the good we de&s;ire to receive from them.</P>
<P N="86">86. Our own di&s;tru&s;t ju&s;tifies the deceit of others.</P>
<P N="87">87. Men would not live long in &s;ociety together, if they were not the bubbles of one another.</P>
<P N="88">88. Self-love increa&s;es or le&s;&s;ens in our e&s;teem, the good qualities of our friends, in proportion to the &s;atisfaction we take in them: and we judge of their merit by their manner of living with us.</P>
<P N="89">89. Every body complains of his memory, but no body of his judgment.</P>
<P N="90">90. In our conver&s;ation in the world, we plea&s;e oftener by our faults, than by our good qualities.</P>
<P N="91">91. The greate&s;t ambition has not the lea&s;t appearance of ambi|tion, when it finds the thing a&s;pired to, ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to be attained.</P>

<P N="97">97. 'T was a mi&s;take when people made wit and judgment to be two different things: the judgment is nothing but a greater degree of wit, that penetrates into the bottom of things, ob&s;erves all that ought to be ob&s;erved, and di&s;covers tho&s;e things which &s;eemed impo&s;&s;ible to be di&s;covered: from whence it mu&s;t be concluded, that it is the greate&s;t extent of wit which produces all the effects which are attri|buted to judgment.</P>

<P N="139">139. One of the rea&s;ons why we meet with &s;o few people who ap|pear rea&s;onable and agreeable in conver&s;ation, is, that there is hardly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> body who does not think more on what he has a mind to &s;ay, than how pertinently to an&s;wer to what is &s;aid to him.

<P N="178">178.

<P N="179">179. We &s;ometimes with levity complain of our friends, to ju&s;ti|fy before hand our own levity.</P>
<P N="180">180. Our repentance is not &s;o much a remor&s;e for the ill which we have done, as a fear of the ill which may happen to us.</P>
<P N="181">181. There is an incon&s;tancy which proceeds from the levity of the mind, or from its weakne&s;s, that cau&s;es it to receive all the opi|nions of other&punc; people; and there is another which is more excu&s;a|ble, which proceeds from a di&s;gu&s;t of things.</P>

<P N="233">233. There are in afflictions, &s;everal &s;orts of hypocri&s;y. In one &s;ort, under pretence of grieving for the lo&s;s of a per&s;on who was dear to us, we grieve for our&s;elves: we mourn for the lo&s;s of that good opinion he had of us; we grieve for the diminution of our pro|fit, our plea&s;ure, and our reputation. Thus, the dead have the ho|nour of tho&s;e tears, which are &s;hed only for the living.

There is yet another kind of tears, which have out &s;hallow &s;prings, that flow indeed, but are ea&s;ily dried up.

I mean, that contempt of death, which the heathens boa&s;ted to derive from their own natural &s;trength, with|out the hope of a better life. There is a great deal of difference be|tween &s;uffering death with co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">tancy, and contemning it. The fir&s;t is common enough, but the other. I am apt to believe, is never &s;in|cere. All that is po&s;&s;ible to be &s;aid, to per&s;uade us that death is no evil, has been written: and &s;ome of the weake&s;t men, as well as the heroes, have given a thou&s;and eminent examples in confirmation of this opinion. Yet, after all, I doubt whether any per&s;on of good &s;en&s;e ever believed it: and the pains they are at to per&s;uade others and them&s;elves, di&s;cover clearly enough, that it is no ea&s;y ta&s;k to do it. A man may have many rea&s;ons to be di&s;gu&s;ted with life, but can have no rea&s;on to de&s;pi&s;e death: tho&s;e even who choo&s;e a voluntary death, e&s;teem is not &s;o &s;light a matter, and are as much &s;tartled at it, and decline it as much as others, when it comes upon them in any other manner than that they have cho&s;en them&s;elves. The inequality that is remarkable in the courage of a world of brave men, proceeds from this, that death di&s;covers it&s;elf in different &s;hapes to them, and appears more pre&s;ent to their imagination at one time than another: &s;o it happens, that after having de&s;pi&s;ed what they did not know, they are afraid at la&s;t of what they do know&punc; If we would not be|lieve it the greate&s;t of all evils, we mu&s;t never look it in the face with all its circum&s;tances.

The nece&s;&s;ity of dying, made up all the con&s;tancy of the philo&s;o|phers; they thought they had be&s;t go with a good grace, &s;ince there was no help for their going; and not being able to eternize their lives, they omitted nothing to eternize their reputations and to &s;ave from &s;hipwreck all that could be &s;ecured Let us, then, to put the be&s;t face on the matter, be contented with not di&s;covering to our|&s;elves, all that we think o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> it, and let us hope for more from our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, than from tho&s;e weak &s;ea&s;onings which make us fancy we are able to approach death with indifference The glory of dy|ing re&s;olutely, the hope of being lamented whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> gone, the de&s;ire of leaving a fair reputation behind us, the a&s;&s;urance of being freed from the mi&s;eries of life, and of depending no longer on the caprices of fortune, are remedies not to be rejected: but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> are not to be &s;uppo&s;ed infallible&punc; They &s;erve to embold<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n us; as in war, a poor hedge does often to embolden the &s;oldiers that are to make their ap|proa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">s to a place, from whence the enemy is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> firing: while they are at a di&s;tance they imagine it may be a good &s;helter, but when near, they find it but a &s;light defence.

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE intent of the author (for I very well knew his intent) was to make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a&s;hamed of their vices, by &s;howing them how ridiculous they were made by them, and how impo&s;&s;ible it was for a bad man to be polite. It may be, that graver books have been written on this &s;ubject, but few more to the point; its author being equally &s;killed in books and in men, in the dead languages and the living; I pre&s;ume, therefore, that his ob&s;ervati|ons will be generally found true, and his maxims ju&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><HI>At fir&s;t fight, it may &s;eem that this e&s;&s;ay is calculated only for a few; but I beg leave to ob&s;erve, that in truth there are but few to whom it may not be u&s;eful. As every man in his &s;tation ought to be hone&s;t, &s;o every man in his behaviour may be polite; nay, he ought to be &s;o&punc; becau&s;e he will be &s;ure to find his account in it; &s;ince it is a quality ea&s;ier di&s;cerned, and of con&s;e|quence &s;ooner rewarded than the former. We mu&s;t know and conver&s;e with a man, to be convinced of his probity; whereas we perceive at fir&s;t &s;ight whether he has good manners; by this we are prejudiced in his fa|vour: and who then would not &s;trive to learn an art at once &s;o ea&s;y, and &s;o exten&s;ive in its u&s;e?</HI></P>
<P><HI>But, if it be beneficial to all, it is peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary to</HI> Youth. <HI>It is at once a remedy for ba&s;hfulne&s;s, and a pre&s;ervative again&s;t the contrary vice. A polite per&s;on &s;tands in the middle, between a &s;heepi&s;h mode&s;ty and a di&s;ta&s;teful boldne&s;s. It is the habit which adds the la&s;t poli&s;h to education, brightens the man of letters, and &s;preads a glo&s;s over that &s;ort of learning which would otherwi&s;e appear pedantic. The polite man may not only under&s;tand Latin and Greek, but may al&s;o introduce them into di&s;cour&s;e, provided it be before proper company, and on a proper oc|ca&s;ion. The unpoli&s;hed &s;cholar lugs them in whenever they occur; quotes</HI> OVID <HI>to his mi&s;tre&s;s, and repeats a pa&s;&s;age from</HI> POLYAENEUS <HI>to a captain of the guards. To your youth, therefore, I beg leave to recom|mend this conci&s;e manual, which will co&s;t them but little time to read, and no great pains to practi&s;e.</HI></P>

<P>Thus you &s;ee me &s;tript of the ill-obeyed authority of a pedagogue; and are, for the future, to con&s;ider me only as a &s;chool-fellow play|ing the ma&s;ter, that we may the better conquer the difficulties of our ta&s;k.</P>
<P>To proceed then in the character, which, for my own &s;ake, as well as yours, I have put on, let me remind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ou in the fir&s;t place,</P>
<P>That <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> however antique you may think it, is a thing ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary in the compo&s;ition of him who endeavours at acqui|ring a <HI>philo&s;ophical politene&s;s;</HI> and let us receive it as a maxim, that, without <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> there is no being a <HI>fine gentleman.</HI></P>
<P>However, to &s;often, at the &s;ame time that we yield to this con|&s;traint, I tell my blooming audience with plea&s;ure, that <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> like a fop's under-wai&s;tcoat, may be worn out of &s;ight: and, provided it be but worn at all, I &s;hall not quarrel with them, though vivacity, like a laced &s;hirt, be put over it to conceal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">: for, to pur&s;ue the com|pari&s;on, our minds &s;uffer no le&s;s from indi&s;cretion, than our bodies from the injuries of weather.</P>
<P>Next to this, another out-of-the-way qualification mu&s;t be acqui|red; and that is <HI>Calmne&s;s.</HI> Let not the &s;marts of the univer&s;ity, the &s;parks of the &s;ide-boxes, or the genteel flutterers of the drawing room, imagine, that I will deprive them of tho&s;e elevated enjoyments, drinking tea with a toa&s;t, galla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ting a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">an, or roving, like a butter|fly, through a parterre of beauties.

<P>I &s;hall have frequent occa&s;ion in the following pages to &s;how from examples, of what mighty u&s;e <HI>rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>undi&s;turbed temper</HI> are, to men of great commerce in the world; and therefore &s;hall in&s;i&s;t no farther on them here.</P>

For, can there be any thing more amiable in human nature, than to think, to &s;peak, and to do, whatever good lies in our power unto all?

To this let me add another argument in favour of this benevolence of &s;oul; and farther per&s;ua|&s;ions will, I flatter my&s;elf, be unnece&s;&s;ary, <HI>Good nature</HI> adorns every perfection a man is ma&s;ter of, and throws a veil over every blemi&s;h which would otherwi&s;e appear.

<P>Thus, in a word, <HI>Sen&s;e, Moderation,</HI> and <HI>Sweetne&s;s,</HI> are e&s;&s;ential to a <HI>Polite Philo&s;opher;</HI> and if you think you cannot acquire the&s;e, eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> lay my e&s;&s;ay a&s;ide.

Nature denies the fir&s;t to few; the &s;econd is in every man's power; and no man need be without the la&s;t, who either va|lues general e&s;teem, or is not indifferent to public hate. For to &s;ay truth, what is nece&s;&s;ary to make an hone&s;t man, properly applied, would make a polite one: and, as almo&s;t every one would take it ami&s;s, if we &s;hould deny him the fir&s;t appellation; &s;o you may per|ceive from thence how few there are, who, but from their own in|di&s;cretion, may de&s;erve the &s;econd. It is want of attention, not capacity, which leaves us &s;o many brutes; and, I flatter my&s;elf, there will be &s;ewer of this &s;pecies, if any of them can be prevailed on to read this. A de&s;cription of their faults is &s;o &s;uch the fitte&s;t lecture; for few mon&s;ters there are who can view them&s;elves in a gla&s;s.</P>

<P>My readers, who have been many of them accu&s;tomed to think <HI>politene&s;s</HI> rather an ornamental accompli&s;hment, than a thing nece&s;&s;ary to be acquired in order to an ea&s;y and happy life, may, from hence pay le&s;s attention than my in&s;tructions require, unle&s;s I can convince them they are in the wrong. In order to which, I mu&s;t put them in mind, that the tranquillity, and even felicity of our days, depends as &s;trongly on &s;mall things, as on great; of which men may be ea|&s;ily convinced if they but reflect how great unea&s;ine&s;s they have ex|perienced from cro&s;s accidents, although they related but to trifles; and at the &s;ame time remember, that di&s;quiet is of all others the greate&s;t evil, let it ari&s;e from what it will.</P>
<P>Now, in the concerns of life, as in tho&s;e of fortune, numbers are brought into what are called bad circum&s;tances from &s;mall neglects, rather than from any great errors in material affairs. People are too apt to think lightly of &s;hillings and pence, forgetting that they are the con&s;tituent parts of pounds; until the deficiency in the greater article &s;hows them their mi&s;take, and convinces them, by fatal ex|perience, of a truth, which they might have learned from a little at|tention, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that great &s;ums are made up of &s;mall.</P>

<P>Examples have, generally &s;peaking, greater force than precepts; I will therefore delineate the characters of <HI>Honorious</HI> and <HI>Garcia,</HI> two gentlemen of my acquaintance, who&s;e humour I have perfectly con|&s;idered, and &s;hall repre&s;ent them without the lea&s;t exaggeration.</P>
<P><HI>Honorious</HI> is a per&s;on equally di&s;tingui&s;hed by his birth and for|tune. He has naturally good &s;en&s;e; and that too hath been impro|ved by a regular education. His wit is lively, and his morals with|out a &s;tain.&mdash;Is not this an amiable character? Yet <HI>Honorious</HI> is not beloved. He has, &s;ome way or other, contracted a notion, that it is beneath a man of honour to fall below the height of truth in any degree, or on any occa&s;ion what&s;oever. From this principle he &s;peaks bluntly what he thinks, without regarding the company who are by. Some weeks ago, he read a lecture on female hypo|cri&s;y, before a married couple, though the lady was much &s;u&s;pect|ed on that head. Two hours after he fell into a warm declamation again&s;t &s;imony and prie&s;tcraft before two dignitaries of the church&punc; and, from a continued cour&s;e of this &s;ort of behaviour, hath ren|dered him&s;elf dreaded as a monitor, in&s;tead of being e&s;teemed as a friend.</P>
<P><HI>Garcia,</HI> on the contrary, came into the world under the greate&s;t di&s;advantages. His birth was mean, and his fortune not to be men|tioned; yet, though he is &s;carce forty, he has acquired a hand&s;ome e&s;tate in the country, and lives on it with more reputation than mo&s;t of his neighbours. While a &s;ervitor at the univer&s;ity, he, by his a&s;&s;iduities, recommended him&s;elf to a noble lord, and thereby pro|cured a place of fifty pounds a year in a public office. His behavi|our there made him as many friends as there were per&s;ons belong|ing to this board. His readine&s;s in doing favours, gained him the hearts of his inferiors; his deference for tho&s;e in the highe&s;t charac|ters in the office, procured him their good will; and the compla|cency he expre&s;&s;ed towards his equals and tho&s;e immediately above

him, made them e&s;pou&s;e his intere&s;t, with almo&s;t as much warmth, as they did their own. By this management, in ten years time, he ro&s;e to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an office which brought him in a thou&s;and pounds a-year &s;alary, and near double as much in perqui&s;ites. Af|fluence hath made no alteration in his manners. The &s;ame ea&s;ine&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition attends him in that fortune to which it has rai&s;ed him; and he is at this day the delight of all who know him, from an art <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e has of per&s;uading them, that their plea&s;ures and their intere&s;ts are equally dear to him with his own. Who, if it were in his power, would refu&s;e what <HI>Honorious</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es? and who would not wi&s;h that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion accompanied with <HI>Garcia'</HI>s di&s;po&s;ition?</P>
<P>I flatter my&s;elf, that, by this time, mo&s;t of my readers have ac|quired a tolerable idea of <HI>politene&s;s,</HI> and a ju&s;t notion of its u&s;e, in their pa&s;&s;age through life.

<P>Having now gone through the <HI>pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">cogn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">a</HI> of <HI>Polite Philo&s;ophy,</HI> it is requi&s;ite we &s;hould de&s;cend with greater particularity into its &s;everal branches.

<P>The <HI>polite Sage</HI> thinks in a quite different way. Per&s;picuity is the garment in which his conceptions appear; and his &s;entiments, if they are of any u&s;e, carry this additional advantage with them, that &s;carce any labour is acquired in attaining them. Graver di&s;cour&s;es, like galenical medicines, are often formidable in their figure, and nau&s;eous in their ta&s;te. Lectures from a doctor in our &s;cience, like a chemical extraction, convey knowledge, as it were by drops; and re&s;tore &s;en&s;e as the other does health, without the <HI>aparatus</HI> of phy&s;ic.</P>

<P>It is now time to apply what we have already advanced, to tho&s;e points in which they may be mo&s;t u&s;eful to us; and therefore we will begin, by con&s;idering what advantage the practice of them wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> procure, in re&s;pect to there three things which are e&s;teemed of the greate&s;t con&s;equence in the general opinion of the world. This leads me, in the fir&s;t place, to explain the &s;entiments and conduct of a <HI>Polite Philo&s;opher</HI> in regard to <HI>Religion.</HI> I am not ignorant, that there are a multitude of tho&s;e who pa&s;s both on the world, and on them&s;elves, for very polite per&s;ons, who look on this as a topic be|low their notice. <HI>Religion</HI> (&s;ay they with a &s;neer) is the companion of melancholy minds; but, for the gayer part of the world, it is ill manners to mention it among&s;t them. Be it &s;o. But give me leave to add, that there is no ranker &s;pecies of ill-breeding, than &s;peaking of it &s;arca&s;tically, or with contempt.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Religion,</HI> &s;trictly &s;peaking, means that wor&s;hip which men, from a &s;en&s;e of duty, pay to that Being, unto whom they owe their own exi&s;tence, with all tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings and benefits which attend it.</Q></P>
<P>Let a man but reflect on this definition, and it will be impo&s;&s;ible for him not to perceive, that treating this in a ludicrous way, mu&s;t not only be unpolite, but &s;hocking. Who, that has a regard for a man, would not &s;tart at the thought of &s;aying a ba&s;e thing of his father before him? And yet what a di&s;tance is there between the notron of a <HI>father</HI> and a <HI>Creator!</HI> Since therefore no further argu|ments are nece&s;&s;ary to prove the incon&s;i&s;tence between <HI>raillery</HI> and <HI>religion,</HI> what can he more cogent to a polite man, than thus &s;how|ing that &s;uch di&s;cour&s;es of his would be <HI>mal a propos.</HI></P>
<P>Thus much for tho&s;e who might be guilty of <HI>unpolitene&s;s</HI> with re|&s;pect to <HI>religion</HI> in general, a fault unaccountably common in an age which pretends to be &s;o <HI>polite.</HI></P>
<P>As to particular religions, or rather tenets in religion, men are generally warm in them, from one of the&s;e two rea&s;ons, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> ten|derne&s;s of con&s;cience, or a high &s;en&s;e of their own judgments. Men of plain parts, and hone&s;t di&s;po&s;itions, look on &s;alvation as too &s;erious a thing to be je&s;ted with: a <HI>polite</HI> man therefore will be cautious of offending upon that head, becau&s;e he knows it will give the per&s;on to whom he &s;peaks pain; a thing ever oppo&s;ite to the character of a <HI>poli&s;hed philo&s;opher.</HI> The latter rea&s;on, which I have a&s;&s;igned for men's zeal in religions matters, may &s;eem to have le&s;s weight than the fir&s;t; but he was con&s;iders it attentively will be of another opinion. Men of &s;peculative religion, who are &s;o from the conviction rather of their heads than their hearts, are not a bit le&s;s vehement than the real devotees. He who &s;ays a flight or a &s;e|vere thing of their faith, &s;eems to them to have thereby undervalued their under&s;tandings, and will con&s;equently incur their aver&s;ion; which no man of common &s;en&s;e would hazard for a lively expre&s;|&s;ion: much le&s;s a per&s;on of good breeding, who &s;hould make it his chief aim to be well with all.

<P>Next to their concerns in the other world, men are u&s;ually mo&s;t taken up with the concerns of the <HI>public</HI> here. The love of our country is among tho&s;e virtues to which every man thinks he &s;hould pretend; and the way in which this is generally &s;hown, is by fall|ing into what we call <HI>parties;</HI> where, if a large &s;hare of good &s;en&s;e allay not that heat which is naturally contracted from &s;uch engage|ments, a man &s;oon falls into all the violences of <HI>faction,</HI> and looks up|on every one as his enemy, who does not expre&s;s him&s;elf about the public good in the &s;ame terms he does. This is a har&s;h picture, but it is a ju&s;t one, of the far greater part of tho&s;e who are warm in political di&s;putes. A <HI>polite man</HI> will therefore &s;peak as &s;eldom as he can on topics, where, in a mixed company, it is almo&s;t impo&s;|&s;ible to &s;ay any thing that will plea&s;e all.</P>
<P>To &s;ay truth, <HI>patrioti&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> properly &s;o called, is perhaps as &s;carce in this age as in any that has gone before us. Men appear to love them&s;elves &s;o well, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> it &s;eems not altogether credible they &s;hould, at every turn, prefer their country's intere&s;t to their own. The thing looks noble indeed; and therefore like a becoming habit, e|very body would put it on. But this is hypocri&s;y, you'll &s;ay, and therefore &s;hould be detected! Here the <HI>Polite Philo&s;opher</HI> finds new inducements to caution: &s;ore places are always tender; and people at a ma&s;querade are in pain, if you do any thing which may di&s;co|ver their faces.</P>
<P>Our philo&s;ophy is not intended to make a man that four moni|tor who points out folks faults, but to make them in love with their virtues; that is, to make him&s;elf and them ea&s;y while he is with them; and to do, or &s;ay nothing, which, on reflexion, may make them le&s;s his friends at their next meeting.</P>
<P>Let us explain this a little further. The rules we offer, are in|tended rather to guide men in company than when alone.

for a laugh, that di&s;po&s;ition of mind which is ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary to make men ea&s;y when together.</P>
<P>Were I indeed to indulge my own &s;entiments, I &s;hould &s;peak yet with greater freedom on this &s;ubject. Since there is &s;o va&s;t a di&s;proportion when we come to compare tho&s;e who have really ei|ther a concern in the government, or the &s;ervice of their country, more particularly at heart, and the men who pretend to either, merely from a de&s;ire of appearing of &s;ome con&s;equence them&s;elves; we ought certainly to avoid making one of this number, and aim rather at being quiet within our&s;elves, and agreeable to tho&s;e among whom we live, let their political notions be what they will; ina&s;|much as this is a direct road to happine&s;s, which all men profe&s;s they would reach, if they could&punc; <HI>Pomponius Atticus,</HI> who&s;e cha|racter appears &s;o amiable, from the concurring te&s;timony of all who mention him, owed the greate&s;t part of that e&s;teem in which he lived, and of the reputation by which he &s;till &s;urvives, unto his &s;teady ad|herence to this rule. His benevolence made him love mankind in general, and his good &s;en&s;e hindered him from being tainted with tho&s;e party prejudices which had bewitched his friends. He took not up arms for <HI>Cae&s;ar;</HI> nor did he abandon <HI>Italy</HI> when <HI>Pompey</HI> with|drew with his forces, and had, in outward form, the &s;anction of the commonwealth. He &s;aw too plainly the ambition of both: yet he pre&s;erved his complai&s;ance for his friends in each party, without &s;iding with either. Succe&s;s never made them more welcome to <HI>Pomponius;</HI> nor could any defeat le&s;&s;en them in his e&s;teem. When victorious he vi&s;ited them, without &s;haring in their power; and when vanqui&s;hed&punc; he received them, without con&s;idering any thing but their di&s;tre&s;s. In a few words, he entertained no hopes from the good fortune of his friends, nor &s;uffered the rever&s;e of it to chill his brea&s;t with fear. His equanimity produced a ju&s;t effect, and his univer&s;al kindne&s;s made him univer&s;ally beloved.</P>
<P>I fancy this picture of a di&s;po&s;ition, perfectly free from political &s;ourne&s;s, will have an agreeable effect on many of my readers; and prevent their falling into a common mi&s;take, that the circum&s;tances of public affairs, and the characters of public per&s;ons, are the pro|pere&s;t topics for general conver&s;ation: whereas they never con&s;ider, that it is hard to find a company wherein &s;omebody or other hath not either liking or di&s;ta&s;te, or has received injuries or obligations from tho&s;e who are likelie&s;t to be mentioned upon &s;uch occa&s;ions: and who, con&s;equently, will be apt to put a &s;erious con&s;truction on a &s;light expre&s;&s;ion, and remember afterward in earne&s;t, what the &s;peaker ment &s;o much a je&s;t, as never to have thought of it more. The&s;e, perhaps, may pa&s;s with &s;ome for trivial remarks; but tho&s;e who regard their own ea&s;e, and have at all ob&s;erved what conduces to make men di&s;agreeable to one another, I flatter my&s;elf they will have more weight.</P>
<P>Behaviour is like architecture; the &s;ymmetry of the whole plea|&s;es us &s;o much, that we examine not into its parts, which, if we did, we &s;hould find much nicety required in forming &s;uch a &s;truc|ture: though, to per&s;ons of no ta&s;te, the rules of either art would &s;eem to have little connexion with their effects.</P>

<P>In order to have a proper idea of this point, we mu&s;t fir&s;t of all con&s;ider, that the chief cau&s;e both of love and hatred, is cu&s;tom.

A <HI>polite man</HI> will have a care of ridiculing phy&s;ic before one of the faculty, talking di&s;re&s;pectfully of lawyers while gentlemen of the long robe are by, or &s;peaking contemptibly of the clergy when with any of that order.</P>

<P>Let us now proceed to &s;peak of raillery in general. Invective is a weapon worn as commonly as a &s;word; and, like that, is often in the hands of tho&s;e who know not how to u&s;e it. Men of true courage fight but &s;eldom, and never draw but in their own defence. Bullies are continually &s;quabbling; and, from the ferocity of their behaviour, become the terror of &s;ome companies, and the je&s;t of more. This is ju&s;t the ca&s;e with &s;uch as have a liveline&s;s of thought, directed by a propen&s;ity to ill-nature: indulging them&s;elves at the

expence of others, they, by degrees, incur the di&s;like of all. Meek tempers abhor, men of cool di&s;po&s;ition de&s;pi&s;e, and tho&s;e addict|ed to choler, cha&s;ti&s;e them. Thus a licentiou&s;ne&s;s of tongue, like a &s;pirit of rapine, &s;ets one man again&s;t all; and the defence of reputa|tion, as well as property, puts the human &s;pecies on regarding a malevolent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with a wor&s;e eye than a common thief; becau&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ame is a kind of goods, which, when once taken away, can hardly be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;tored.

<P>A good family, but no fortune, threw <HI>Draco</HI> into the army when he was very young. Dancing, fencing and a &s;mattering of <HI>French,</HI> are all the education either his friends be&s;towed, or his capacity would allow him to receive. He has now been two years in town, and from &s;wearing, drinking, and debauching country wenches (the general route of a military rake) the air of the Capital has given his vices a new turn. By dint of a military uniform, he thru&s;ts him&s;elf into the beau a&s;&s;emblies, where a dauntle&s;s effrontery, and a natural volubility of tongue, con&s;pire to make him pa&s;s for a fel|low of wit and &s;pirit.</P>
<P>A ba&s;tard ambition makes him envy every great character; and he has ju&s;t &s;en&s;e enough to know, that this qualification will never recommend him to the e&s;teem of men of &s;en&s;e, or the favour of wo|men of virtue, he has thence contracted an antipathy to both; and, by giving a boundle&s;s loo&s;e to univer&s;al malice, makes continual war again&s;t honour and reputation, wherever he finds them.</P>
<P><HI>Hecatilla</HI> is a female firebrand, more dangerous, and more art|fully vindictive, than <HI>Draco</HI> him&s;elf.

Next to tho&s;e cautions with re&s;pect to raillery, which, if we ex|amine &s;trictly, we &s;hall find no better than a well-bred phra&s;e for &s;peaking ill of folks; it may not be ami&s;s to warn our readers of a certain vehemence in di&s;cour&s;e, exceedingly &s;hocking to others, at the &s;ame time that it not a little exhau&s;ts them&s;elves.</P>
<P>If we trace this error to its &s;ource, we &s;hall find that the &s;pring of it is an impatience at finding others differ from us in opinion; and can there be any thing more unrea&s;onable, than to blame that di&s;po|&s;ition in them which we cheri&s;h in our&s;elves?</P>
<P>If &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion be a thing &s;o di&s;agreeable to us, why &s;hould we ex|pect it from the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">?

<P>As this is a foible more e&s;pecially indecent in the fair &s;ex, I think it will be highly nece&s;&s;ary to offer another, and perhaps a more co|gent argument to their con&s;ideration. Pa&s;&s;ion is a prodigious ene|my to beauty: it ruffles the &s;weete&s;t features, di&s;colours the fine&s;t complexion, and, in a word, gives the air of a fury to the face of an angel. Far be it from me to lay re&s;traints upon the ladies; but, an di&s;&s;uading them from this method of enforcing their &s;entiments, I put them upon an ea&s;ier way of effecting what they de&s;ire: for what can be denied to beauty, when &s;peaking with an air of &s;atis|faction?

<P>To vehemence in di&s;cour&s;e, let me join redundancy in it al&s;o, a fault flowing rather from carele&s;&s;ne&s;s than de&s;ign: and which is more dangerous, from its being more neglected. Pa&s;&s;ion as I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, excites oppo&s;ition; and that very oppo&s;ition, to a man of to|lerable &s;en&s;e, will be the &s;tronge&s;t reproof for his inadvertency; whereas a per&s;on of a loquacious di&s;po&s;ition, may often e&s;cape open <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">n&s;ure from the re&s;pect due to his quality; or from an apprehen|&s;ion in tho&s;e with whom he conver&s;es, that a check would but in|crea&s;e the evil; and, like curbing a hard-mouthed h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r&s;e, &s;erve on|ly to make him run the fa&s;ter: from whence the per&s;on in fault is often rivetted in his error, by mi&s;taking a &s;ilent contempt, for pro|found attention.</P>
<P>Perhaps this &s;hort de&s;cription may &s;et many of my readers right; which, whatever they may think of it, I a&s;&s;ure them is of no &s;mall importance. Conver&s;ation is a &s;ort of bank, in which all who com|po&s;e it have their re&s;pective &s;hares.

I think it nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that it differs from other copartner&s;hips in one very material point; which is this, that it is wor&s;e taken if a man pays in more than his proportion, than if he had not contributed his full quota, provided he be not too far deficient: for the prevention of which, let us have <HI>Horace's</HI> caution continually in our eye.</P>

In order therefore to diver&s;ity a &s;ubject, which can no other way be treated agreeably, permit me to throw together a &s;et of characters I once had the opportunity of &s;eeing, which will afford a ju&s;t picture of the&s;e <HI>ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> plots</HI> in conver&s;ation, and which my readers, if they plea&s;e, may call the a&s;&s;embly of impertinents.</P>
<P>There was a coffee-hou&s;e in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hat end of the town where I lodged &s;ome time ago, at which &s;everal gentlemen u&s;ed to meet of an eve|ning, who, from a happy corre&s;pondence in their humours and ca|pacities entertained one another agreeably, from the clo&s;e of the af|ternoon till it was time to go to bed.</P>
<P>About &s;ix months this &s;ociety &s;ub&s;i&s;ted with great regularity, though without re&s;traint. Every gentleman who frequented the hou&s;e, and conver&s;ed with the crectors of this occa&s;ional club, were invited to pa&s;s an evening, when they thought fit, in a room, one pair of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">airs &s;et apart for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The report of this meeting drew, one night when I had the ho|nour of being there, three gentlemen of di&s;tinction, who were &s;o well known <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o mo&s;t of the members, that admittance could not be refu&s;ed them. One of them, whom I choo&s;e to call <HI>Major Ramble,</HI> turned of three&s;core, and who had had an excellent education, &s;eized the di&s;cour&s;e about an hour before &s;upper, and gave us a very
<PB N="171" REF="027039_0173_0FD2FB55E864F528">
copious account of the remarks he had made in three years travels through <HI>Italy.</HI> He began with a geographical de&s;cription of the do|minions of his <HI>Sardinian</HI> maje&s;ty as duke of <HI>Savoy;</HI> and, after a di|gre&s;&s;ion on the fortifications of <HI>Turin,</HI> in &s;peaking of which he &s;how|ed him&s;elf a perfect engineer, he proceeded to the &s;ecret hi&s;tory of the intrigues of that court, from the propo&s;al of the match with <HI>Por|tugal,</HI> to the abdication of king <HI>Victor Amadeus.</HI> After this he run over the general hi&s;tory of <HI>Milan, Parma,</HI> and <HI>Modena:</HI> dwelt half an hour on the adventures of the la&s;t duke of <HI>Mantua;</HI> gave us a ha&s;ty &s;ketch of the court of <HI>Rome:</HI> transferred him&s;elf from thence to the kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> repeated the in&s;urrection of <HI>Ma&s;&s;aniello,</HI> and, at a quarter before ten, fini&s;hed his ob&s;ervations with the recital of what happened at the reduction of that kingdom to the obedience of the pre&s;ent emperor. What contributed to make this conduct of his the more out of the way, was, that every gentleman in the room had been in <HI>Italy</HI> as well as he: and one of them, who was a mer|chant, was the very per&s;on at who&s;e hou&s;e the major re&s;ided when at <HI>Naples.</HI> Po&s;&s;ibly he might imagine the knowledge they had in tho&s;e things might give them a greater reli&s;h for his animadver&s;ions; or, to &s;peak more candidly, the de&s;ire of di&s;playing his own parts buried every other circum&s;tance in oblivion.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as the major had done &s;peaking, a gentleman called for a gla&s;s of water; and happened to &s;ay, after drinking it, that he found his con&s;titution much mended &s;ince he left off malt liquor. Doctor <HI>Hectick,</HI> another of the &s;trangers, immediately laid hold of this opportunity, and gave us a large account of the virtues of wa|ter; confirming whatever he advanced from the mo&s;t eminent phy|&s;icians. From the main &s;ubject, he made an ea&s;y tran&s;ition to me|dical baths and &s;prings. Nor were his &s;earches bounded by our own country; he conde&s;cended to acquaint us with the properties of the &s;prings of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> particularized the genuine &s;mell of <HI>Spa</HI> wa|ter, applauded the wonderful effects of the <HI>Pierpont</HI> mineral; and, like a true patriot, wound up his di&s;qui&s;itions with preferring <HI>A&s;trop</HI> wells (within three miles of which he was born) to them all. It was now turned of eleven; when the major and the doctor took their leaves and went away together in a hackney-coach.</P>
<P>The company &s;eemed inclinable to extend their u&s;ual time of &s;it|ting, in order to divert them&s;elves after the night's fatigue. When, Mr. <HI>Papilio,</HI> the third new comer, after two or three &s;evere reflex|ions on the oddity of &s;ome people's humours, who were for im|po&s;ing their own idle conceits as things worthy the attention of a whole company; though, at the &s;ame time, their &s;ubjects are tri|vial, and their manner of treating them in&s;ipid: for my part, con|tinued he, gentlemen, mo&s;t people do me the honour to &s;ay, that few per&s;ons under&s;tand medals better than I do. To put the mu&s;ty &s;tories of the&s;e queer old men out of our heads, I'll give you the hi&s;tory of a valuable medallion, which was &s;ent me about three weeks ago from <HI>Venice.</HI> Without &s;taying for any further mark of approbation than &s;ilence, he entered immediately on a long di&s;&s;er|tation; in which he had &s;carce proceeded ten minutes, before his auditors, lo&s;ing all patience, followed the example of an old <HI>Tur|key</HI> merchant, who, takin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> hat and gloves, went directly down &s;tairs without &s;aying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> word.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Dryden,</HI> who knew human nature perhaps as well as any man who ever &s;tudied it, has given us a ju&s;t picture of the force of fe|male charms, in the &s;tory of <HI>Cymon</HI> and <HI>Iphigenia. Boccace,</HI> from whom he took it, had adorned it with all the tin&s;el finery an <HI>Italian</HI> compo&s;ition is capable of. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> poet, like &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> tra|vellers, gave <HI>&s;terling</HI> &s;ilver in exchange for that &s;uperficial gilding; and be&s;towed a moral where he found a tale. He paints, in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> a &s;oul buried in a confu&s;ion of ideas, inflamed with &s;o little fire, as &s;carce to &s;truggle under the load, or afford any glimmerings of &s;en&s;e. In this condition, he repre&s;ents him &s;truck with the rays of <HI>Iphigenia'</HI>s beauty; kindled by them, his mind exerts its powers, his intellectual faculties &s;eem to awake; and that uncouth ferocity of manners, by which he had hitherto been di&s;tingui&s;hed, gave way to an obliging behaviour, the natural effect of love.</P>
<P>The moral of this fable is a truth which can never be inculcated too much. It is to the fair &s;ex we owe the mo&s;t &s;hining qualities of which ours is ma&s;ter: as the ancients in&s;inuated, with their u&s;ual addre&s;s, by painting both the Virtues and Graces as females. Men of true ta&s;te feel a natural complai&s;ance for women when they con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;e with them, and fall, without knowing it, upon every art of

plea&s;ing; which is the di&s;po&s;ition at once the mo&s;t grateful to others, and the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory to our&s;elves. An intimate acquaintance with the other &s;ex fixes this complai&s;ance into a habit, and that ha|bit is the very e&s;&s;ence of <HI>politene&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Nay, I pre&s;ume to &s;ay, <HI>politene&s;s</HI> can be no other way attained. Books may furni&s;h us with right ideas, experience may prove our judgments, but it is the acquaintance of the ladies only, which can be&s;tow that ea&s;ine&s;s of addre&s;s, whereby the <HI>fine gentleman</HI> is di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from the <HI>&s;cholar</HI> and the <HI>man of bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>That my readers may be perfectly &s;atisfied in a point, which I think of &s;o great importance, let us examine this a little more &s;trictly.</P>
<P>There is a certain con&s;titutional pride in men, which hinders their yielding in point of knowledge, honour or virtue, to one ano|ther. This immediately for&s;akes us at the &s;ight of women. And the being accu&s;tomed to &s;ubmit to the ladies gives a new turn to our ideas, and opens a path to rea&s;on, which &s;he had not trod be|fore. Things appear in another light, and that degree of compla|&s;ancy &s;eems now a virtue, which heretofore we regarded as a mean|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>I have dwelt the longer on the charms of the &s;ex, ari&s;ing from the perfection vi&s;ible in their exterior compo&s;ition, becau&s;e there is the &s;tronge&s;t analogy between them, and excellencies which, from a nicer inquiry, we di&s;cover in the minds of the fair. As they are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the robu&s;t make of man by that delicacy, ex|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;&s;ed by nature, in their form; &s;o the &s;everity of ma&s;culine &s;en&s;e is &s;oftened by a &s;weetne&s;s peculiar to the female &s;oul.</P>
<P>A native capacity of plea&s;ing attends them through every circum|&s;tance of life; and, what we improperly call the weakne&s;s of the &s;ex, gives them a &s;uperiority unattainable by force.</P>
<P>The fable of the north wind and the &s;un, contending to make the man throw off his cloak, is not an improper picture of the &s;pecific difference between the powers of either &s;ex. The blu&s;tering fierce|ne&s;s of the former, in&s;tead of producing the effect at which it aimed, made the fellow but wrap him&s;elf up the clo&s;er; yet no &s;ooner did the &s;un beams play, than that which before protected, became now an incumbrance.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t &s;o, that pride which makes us tenacious in di&s;putes between man and man, when applied to the ladies, in&s;pires us with an ea|gerne&s;s not to contend, but to obey.</P>
<P>To &s;peak &s;incerely and philo&s;ophically, women &s;eem de&s;igned by Providence to &s;pread the &s;ame &s;plendour and cheerfulne&s;s through the intellectual economy, that the cele&s;tial bodies diffu&s;e over the material part of the creation. Without them, we might indeed con|tend, de&s;troy, and triumph over one another. Fraud and force would divide the world between them: and we &s;hould pa&s;s our lives, like &s;laves, in continual to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">l, without the pro&s;pect of plea&s;ure or re|laxation.</P>
<P>It is the conver&s;ation of women that gives a proper bias to our in|clinations, and, by abating the ferocity of our pa&s;&s;ions, engages us to that gentlene&s;s of deportment which we &s;tyle <HI>humanity.</HI> The ten|derne&s;s we have for them, &s;oftens the ruggedne&s;s o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> our own nature;
<PB N="176" REF="027039_0178_0FD2FB64363D9AD8">
and the virtues we put on to make the better figure in their eyes, keep us in humour with our&s;elves.</P>
<P>I &s;peak it without affectation or vanity, that no man has applied more a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly than my&s;elf to the &s;tudy of the fair &s;ex; and I over it with the greate&s;t &s;implicity of heart, that I have not only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the mo&s;t engaging and mo&s;t amiable, but al&s;o the mo&s;t generous and mo&s;t heroic qualities among&s;t the ladies; and that I have di&s;covered more of candour, di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, and fervour in their friend&s;hips, than in tho&s;e of our own &s;ex, though I have been very careful, and particularly happy in the choice of my acquaintance.</P>
<P>My readers will, I dare &s;ay, ob&s;erve, and indeed I de&s;ire they &s;hould, a more than ordinary zeal for inculcating a high e&s;teem of, and a &s;incere attachment to the fair. What I propo&s;e from it, is to rectify certain notions, which are not only de&s;tructive of all <HI>politene&s;s,</HI> but, at the &s;ame time, detrimental to &s;ociety, and incompatible with the dignity of human nature. The&s;e have, of late years, &s;pread much among tho&s;e who a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves the title of <HI>fine gentle|men;</HI> and, in con&s;equence thereof, talk with great freedom of tho&s;e from whom they are in no danger of being called to an account. There is &s;o much of ba&s;ene&s;s, cowardice, and contempt of truth, in this way of treating tho&s;e who are alone capable of making <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s truly and rationally happy, that, to con&s;ider the crime, mu&s;t be &s;ufficient to make a rea&s;onable man abhor it. Levity is the be&s;t ex|cu&s;e for a tran&s;ient &s;lip of this kind: but to per&s;i&s;t in it, is evidently de&s;cending from our own &s;pecies, and, as far as we are able, put|ting on the brute.</P>

<P>I choo&s;e to put an end to my lecture on <HI>politene&s;s</HI> here, becau&s;e, having &s;poken of the ladies, I would not de&s;cend again to any other &s;ubject. In the current of my di&s;cour&s;e, I have taken pains to &s;how the u&s;e and amiablene&s;s of the art which this treati&s;e was written to recommend: and have drawn, in as &s;trong colours as I was able, tho&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in behaviour, which men, either through giddine&s;s, or a wrong turn of thought, are mo&s;t likely to commit.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SON ROBERT,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE virtuous inclination of thy matchle&s;s mother; by who&s;e ten|der and godly care thy infancy was governed; together <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> thy education under &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ealous and excellent a tutor, puts me in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|ther a&s;&s;urance than hope, that thou art not ignorant of that <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words">,</HI> which is only able to make thee happy as well in thy death as life; I mean, the true knowledge and wor&s;hip of thy Creator and Redeemer: without which all other things are vain and mi&s;erable. So, that thy youth being guided by &s;o &s;ufficient a teacher, I make no doubt but he will furni&s;h thy life with divine and moral docu|ments. Yet, that I may not ca&s;t off the care be&s;eeming a parent to|wards his child; or that thou &s;hould&s;t have cau&s;e to derive thy whole felicity and welfare rather from others than from whence thou received&s;t thy breath and being; I think it &s;it and agreeably to the affection I bear thee, to help thee with &s;uch rules and adverti&s;e|ments for &s;quaring of thy life, as are rather gained by experience than by reading. To the end, that entering into this exorbitant age, thou maye&s;t be the better prepared to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> &s;candalous cour&s;es where unto the world, and the lack of experience may ea&s;ily draw thee. And, becau&s;e I will not confound thy memory, I have reduced them into ten precepts; and next to Mo&s;es' tables, if thou imprint them in thy mind, thou &s;halt reap the benefit, and I the content. And they are the&s;e following:</P>
<P>I. When it &s;hall plea&s;e God to bring thee to man's e&s;tate, u&s;e great providence and circum&s;pection in choo&s;ing thy wife; for from thence will &s;pring all thy future good or evil. And it is an action of life, like unto a &s;tratagem in war; wherein a man can err but once. If thy e&s;tate be good, match near home and at lei&s;ure; if weak, far off and quickly. Inquire diligently of her di&s;po&s;ition, and how her parents have been inclined in their youth. Let her not be poor, how generous &s;oever. For a man can buy nothing in the market with gentility. Nor choo&s;e a ba&s;e and uncomely creature altoge|ther for wealth; for it will cau&s;e contempt in others, and loathing in thee. Neither make choice of a dwarf, or a fool; for, by the one thou &s;halt beget a race of pigmies; the other will be thy con|tinual di&s;grace; and it will yirke thee to hear her talk. For thou &s;halt find it, to thy great grief, that there is nothing more ful&s;ome than a &s;he-fool.</P>
<P>And, touching the guiding of thy hou&s;e, let thy ho&s;pitality be moderate; and, according to the means of thy e&s;tate, rather plen|tiful than &s;paring, but not co&s;tly. For I never knew a man grow poor by keeping an orderly table. But &s;ome con&s;ume them&s;elves through &s;ecret vices, and their ho&s;pitality bears the blame. But ba|ni&s;h
<PB N="179" REF="027039_0181_0FD2FB6A2A495910">
&s;wini&s;h drunkards out of thine hou&s;e, which is a vice impair|ing health, con&s;uming much, and makes no &s;how. I never heard prai&s;e a&s;cribed to a drunkard, but for the wellbearing of his drink; which is a better commendation for a brewer's hor&s;e or a drayman than either a gentleman, or a &s;erving man. Beware that thou &s;pend not above three of four parts of thy revenues, nor above a third part of that in thy hou&s;e. For the other two parts will do no more than defray thy extraordinaries, which always &s;urmount the ordinary by much: otherwi&s;e thou &s;halt live, like a rich beggar, in continual <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. And the needy man can never live happily nor contentedly. For every di&s;a&s;ter makes him ready to mortgage or &s;ell. And that gentleman, who &s;ells an acre of land, &s;ells an ounce of credit. For gentility is nothing el&s;e but ancient riches. So that if the foundation &s;hall at any time &s;ink, the building mu&s;t need follow.&mdash;So much for the fir&s;t precept.</P>
<P>II. Bring thy children up in learning and obedience, yet with|out outward au&s;terity. Prai&s;e them openly, reprehend them &s;ecretly, give them good countenance and convenient maintenance according to thy ability; otherwi&s;e thy life will &s;eem their bondage, and what portion thou &s;halt leave them at thy death, they will thank death for it, and not thee. And I am per&s;uaded tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he fooli&s;h c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ckering of &s;ome parents, and the over-&s;tern carriage of others, cau&s;e more men and women to take ill cour&s;es, than their own vicious inclinations. Marry thy daughters in time, left they marry them&s;elves. And &s;uf|fer not thy &s;ons to pa&s;s the Alps. For they &s;hall learn nothing there but pride, bla&s;phemy and athei&s;m. And if by travel they get a few broken languages, that &s;hall profit them nothing more than to have one meat &s;erved in divers di&s;hes. Neither, by my con&s;ent, &s;halt thou train them up in wars. For he that &s;ets up his re&s;t to live by that profe&s;&s;ion, can hardly be an hone&s;t man or a good chri&s;tian. Be|&s;ides, it is a &s;cience no longer in reque&s;t than u&s;e. For &s;oldiers in peace are like chimneys in &s;ummer.</P>
<P>III. Live not in the country without corn and cattle about thee. For he that putteth his hand to the pur&s;e for every expence of hou&s;e|hold, is like him that keepeth water in a &s;ieve. And what provi&s;i|on thou &s;halt want, learn to buy it at the be&s;t hand. For there is one penny &s;aved in four, betwixt buying in thy need, and when the markets and &s;ea&s;ons &s;erve fitte&s;t for it. Be not &s;erved with kin&s;|men, or friends, or men intreated to &s;tay; for they expect much and do little; nor with &s;uch as are amorous, for their heads are intoxi|cated. And keep rather too few, than one too many. Feed them well, and pay them with the mo&s;t; and then thou maye&s;t boldly require &s;ervice at their hands.</P>
<P>IV. Let thy k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ndred and allies be welcome to thy hou&s;e and ta|ble. Grace them with thy countenance, and father them in all ho|ne&s;t actions. For by the&s;e means thou &s;halt find them &s;o many ad|vocates to plead an apology for thee behind thy back. But &s;hake off tho&s;e glow-worms, I mean para&s;ites and &s;ycophants, who will feed and fawn upon thee in the &s;ummer of pro&s;perity, but in adver&s;e &s;torms, they will &s;helter thee no more than an arbor in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>V. Beware of &s;urety&s;hip for thy be&s;t friends. He that pay<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">th another man's debts, &s;eeketh his own decay. But if thou can&s;t not otherwi&s;e choo&s;e, rather lend thy money thy&s;elf upon good bonds,
<PB N="180" REF="027039_0182_0FD2FB68CDF07758">
although thou borrow it. So &s;halt thou &s;ecure thy&s;elf and plea&s;ure thy friend. Neither borrow money of a neighbour or a friend, but of a &s;tranger; where paying for it, thou &s;halt hear no more of it. Otherwi&s;e thou &s;halt eclip&s;e thy credit, lo&s;e thy freedom, and pay as dear as to another. But in borrowing of money be precious of thy word. For he that hath care of keeping days of payment, is lord of another man's pur&s;e.</P>
<P>VI. Undertake no &s;uit again&s;t a poor man without receiving much wrong. For, be&s;ides that thou make&s;t him thy compeer, it is a ba&s;e conque&s;t to triumph where there is &s;mall re&s;i&s;tance. Neither at|tempt law again&s;t any man before thou be fully re&s;olved that thou ha&s;t right on thy &s;ide; and then &s;pare not for either money or pains. For a cau&s;e or two &s;o followed and obtained, will free thee from &s;uits great part of thy life.</P>
<P>VII. Be &s;ure to keep &s;ome great man thy friend, but trouble him not for trifles. Compliment him often with many, yet &s;mall gifts, and of little charge. And if thou ha&s;t cau&s;e to be&s;tow any great gra|tuity, let it be &s;omething which may be daily in &s;ight. Otherwi&s;e, in this ambitious age, thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> remain like a hop without a pole; live in ob&s;curity, and be made a foot-ball for every in&s;ulting com|panion to &s;purn at.</P>
<P>VIII. Towards thy &s;uperiors, be humble, yet generous. With thine equals, familiar, yet re&s;pective. Towards thine inferiors, &s;how much humanity, and &s;ome familiarity; as to bow the body, &s;tretch forth the hand, and to uncover the head: with &s;uch like popular compliments. The fir&s;t prepares thy way to advancement. The &s;e|cond make<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> thee known for a man well bred&punc; The third gains a good report; which once got is ea&s;ily kept. For right humanity takes &s;uch deep root in the minds of the multitude, as they are ea|&s;ier gained by unprofitable curte&s;ies than by churli&s;h benefits. Yet I advi&s;e thee not to affect or neglect popularity too much. Seek not to be E&s;&s;ex: &s;hun to be Rawleigh.</P>
<P>IX. Tru&s;t not any man with thy life, credit, or e&s;tate. For it is mere folly for a man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o enthral him&s;elf to a friend, as though oc|ca&s;ion being offered, he &s;hould not dare to become thy enemy.</P>
<P>X. Be not &s;currilous in conver&s;ation, nor &s;atyrical in thy je&s;ts. The one will make thee unwelcome to all company; the other pulls on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uarrels, and gets thee hatred of thy be&s;t friends. For &s;u&s;pici|ous je&s;ts (when any of them favour of truth) leave a bitterne&s;s in the minds of tho&s;e which are touched. And, albeit I have already point <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> yet I think it nece&s;&s;ary to leave it to thee as a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words">.

<HEAD>THE WAY TO WEALTH, Written by Dr. FRANKLIN, Being the Preface to an old Penn&s;ylvania Almanac, called Poor Richard improved.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Courteous Reader!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE heard, that nothing gives an author &s;o great a plea&s;ure, as to find his works re&s;pectfully quoted by others&punc; Judge, then, how much I mu&s;t have been gratified by an incident I am going to relate you. I &s;topped my hor&s;e lately, where a great number of people were collected at an auction of merchants goods. The hour of &s;ale not being come, they were conver&s;ing on the badne&s;s of the times, and one of the company called to a plain clean Old Man, with white locks,&mdash;'Pray, <HI>Father Abraham,</HI> what think you of the times? Will not the&s;e heavy taxes quite ruin the country? How &s;hall we be ever able to pay them? What would you advi&s;e us to?&mdash;Father Abraham &s;tood up, and replied, 'If you would have my advice, I will give it you in &s;hort, "for a word to the wi&s;e is enough", as <HI>Poor Richard</HI> &s;ays.' They joined in de&s;iring him to &s;peak his mind, and gathering round him he proceeded as follows:</P>
<P>'Friends, &s;ays he, the taxes are indeed very heavy; and if tho&s;e laid on by the government were the only ones we had to pay, we might more ea&s;ily di&s;charge them; but we have many others, and much more grievous to &s;ome of us. We are taxed twice as much by our idlene&s;s, three times as much by our pride, and four times as much by our folly; and from the&s;e taxes the commi&s;&s;ioners can|not ea&s;e or deliver us, by allowing an abatement. However, let us hearken to good advice, and &s;omething may be done for us: "God helps them that help them&s;elves," as <HI>Poor Richard</HI> &s;ays.</P>
<P>I. 'It would be thought a hard government that &s;hould tax its people one tenth part of their time, to be employed in its &s;ervice: but idlene&s;s taxes many of us much more; &s;loth, by bringing on di&s;ea&s;es, ab&s;olutely &s;hortens life.&mdash;"Sloth, like ru&s;t, con&s;umes fa&s;|ter than labour wears, while the key u&s;ed is always bright," as <HI>Poor Richard</HI> &s;ays.&mdash;"But do&s;t thou love life, then do not &s;quander time, for that is the &s;tuff life is made of," as <HI>Poor Richard</HI> &s;ays.&mdash;How much more than is nece&s;&s;ary do we &s;pend in &s;leep; forgetting that "The &s;leeping fox catches no poultry, and that there will be &s;leep|ing enough in the grave," as <HI>Poor Richard</HI> &s;ays.</P>
<P>'If time be of all things the mo&s;t precious, wa&s;ting time mu&s;t be', as <HI>Poor Richard</HI> &s;ays. "the greate&s;t prodigality;" &s;ince, as he el&s;ewhere tells us, "Lo&s;t time is never found again; and what we call time enough, always proves little enough:" Let us then up and be doing, and doing to the purpo&s;e; for by diligence we &s;hall do more with le&s;s perplexity. "Sloth makes all things difficult, but indu&s;try all ea&s;y; and, he that ri&s;eth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, mu&s;t trot all day, and &s;hall &s;carce overtake his bu&s;ine&s;s at might; while lazine&s;s travels &s;o &s;lowly, that poverty &s;oon overtakes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.

<PB N="182" REF="027039_0184_0FD2FB7090651520">
let not that drive thee; and early to bed, and early to ri&s;e, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wi&s;e," as <HI>Poor Richard</HI> &s;ays.</P>
<P>'So what &s;ignifies wi&s;hing and hoping for better times? We may make the&s;e times better, if we be&s;tir our&s;elves. Indu&s;try need not wi&s;h, and he that lives upon hope will die fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ing "There are no gains without pains; then help hands, for I have no lands," or, if I have, they are &s;martly taxed. "He that hath a trade, hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> e&s;tate; and he that hath a calling, hath an office of profit and ho|nour," as <HI>Poor Richard</HI> &s;ays; but then the trade mu&s;t be worked at, and the calling well followed, or neither the e&s;tate nor the office will enable us to pay our taxes. If we are indu&s;trious, we &s;hall never &s;tarve; for, "at the working man's hou&s;e hunger looks in, but dares not enter." Nor will t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e bailiff or the con&s;table enter, for, "Indu&s;try pays debts, while de&s;pair encrea&s;eth them." What though you have found no trea&s;ure, nor has any rich relation left, you a legacy, "Diligence is the mother of good luck, and God gives all things to indu&s;try. Then plow deep, while &s;luggards &s;leep, and you &s;hall have corn to &s;ell and to keep."&mdash;Work while it is called to-day, and for you know not how much you may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to-morrow. "One to-day is worth two to-morrows," at <HI>Poor Richard</HI> &s;ays; and farther, "never leave that till to-morrow, which you can do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o-day." If you were a &s;ervant, would you not be a&s;hamed that a good ma&s;ter &s;hould catch you idle? Are you then your own ma&s;ter? Be a&s;hamed to catch your&s;elf idle, when there is &s;o much to be done for your&s;elf, your family, and your country. Handle your tools without mittens; remember, that "The cat in gloves catches no mice," as <HI>Poor Richard</HI> &s;ays. It is true, there is much to be done, and, perhaps, you are weak hand|ed; but &s;tick to it &s;teadily, and you will &s;ee great effects; for, "Con&s;tant dropping wears away &s;tones; and by diligence and pa|tience the mou&s;e a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e in two the cable; and little &s;trokes &s;ell great oaks."</P>
<P>'Methinks I hear &s;ome of you &s;ay, "Mu&s;t a man afford him|&s;elf no lei&s;ure?" I will tell thee, my friend, what <HI>Poor Richard</HI> &s;ays; "Employ thy time well, if thou meane&s;t to gain lei&s;ure; and, &s;ince thou art not &s;ure of a minute, throw not away an hour." <HI>Lei&s;ure</HI> is time for doing &s;omething u&s;eful; this lei&s;ure the diligent man will obtain, but the lazy man never; for, "A life of lei&s;ure and a life of lazine&s;s are two things. Many without labour, would live by their wits only, but they break for the want of &s;tock;" whereas indu&s;try gives comfort, and plenty, and re&s;pect. "Fly plea&s;ures, and they will follow you. The diligent &s;pinner has a large &s;hift; and now I have a &s;heep and a cow, every body bids me good-morrow."</P>
<P>II. 'But with our indu&s;try we mu&s;t likewi&s;e be &s;teady, &s;ettled, and careful, and over&s;ee our own affairs with our own eyes, and not tru&s;t too much to others; for, as <HI>Poor Richard</HI> &s;ays,
<Q><L>I never &s;aw an oft-removed tree,</L>
<L>Nor yet an oft-removed family,</L>
<L>That throve &s;o well as tho&s;e that &s;ettled be."</L></Q>
And again, "Three removes are as bad as a fire;" and again. "Keep thy &s;hop, and thy &s;hop will keep thee, and again, "If you would have your bu&s;ine&s;s done, go; i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> not, &s;end." And again,

"The eye of a ma&s;ter will do more work than both his hands;" and again, "Want of care does us more damage than want of knowledge; and again, "Not to over&s;ee workmen, is to leave them your pur&s;e open; tru&s;ting too much to others care is the ruin of many;" for "If you would have a faithful &s;ervant, and one that you like, &s;erve your&s;elf.

<P>III. 'So much for indu&s;try, my friends, and attention to one's own bu&s;ine&s;s; but to the&s;e we mu&s;t add frugality, if we would make our indu&s;try more certainly &s;ucce&s;sful. A man may, if he knows not how to &s;ave as he gets, "keep his no&s;e all his life to the grind|&s;tone, and die not worth a gro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t at la&s;t.

"If you would be wealthy, think of &s;aving, as well as of get|ting. The Indies have not made Spain rich, becau&s;e her out goes are greater than her incomes."</P>
<P>'Away, then, with your expen&s;ive follies, and you will not th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n have &s;o much cau&s;e to complain of hard times, heavy taxes, and chargeable families for
<Q><L>Women and wine, game and deceit,</L>
<L>Make the wealth &s;mall, and the want great.</L></Q>
And farther, "What maintains one vice, would bring up two children." You may think, perhaps, that a little tea or a little punch now and then, diet a little more co&s;tly, cloaths a little finer, and a little entertainment now and then, can be no great matter; but remember, "Many a little makes a mickle." Beware of lit|tle expences; "A &s;mall leak will &s;ink a great &s;hip," as <HI>Poor Rich|ard</HI> &s;ays; and again, "Who dainties love, &s;hall beggars prove;" and moreover, "Fools make fea&s;ts, and wi&s;e men eat them." Here you are all got together to this &s;ale of fineries and nick-nacks. You call them <HI>goods:</HI> but, if you do not take care, they will prove <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> to &s;ome of you. You expect they will be &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d cheap, and, perhaps, they may for le&s;s than they co&s;t; but, if you have no oc|ca&s;ion for them, they mu&s;t be dear to you. Remember what <HI>Poor Richard</HI> &s;ays, "Buy what thou ha&s;t no need of, and ere long thou &s;halt &s;ell thy nece&s;&s;aries." And again, "At a great pennyworth p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;e a while." He means, that perhaps the cheapne&s;s is apparent only, and not real; or the bargain, by &s;traitening thee in thy bu&s;i|ne&s;s, may do thee more harm than good. For in another place he &s;ays, "Many have been ruined by buying good pennyworths." Again, "It is fooli&s;h to lay out money in a purcha&s;e of repentance;" and yet this folly is practi&s;ed every day at auctions, for want of minding the Almanac. Many a one, for the &s;ake of finery on the back, has gone with a hungry belly, and have &s;tarved their families; "Silks and &s;attins, &s;carlets and velvets, put out the kitchen fire,"
<PB N="184" REF="027039_0186_0FD2FB73F9822EE8">
as <HI>Poor Richard</HI> &s;ays. The&s;e are not the nece&s;&s;aries of life; they can &s;carcely be called the conveniences; and yet only becau&s;e they look pretty, how many want to have them? By the&s;e, and other extravagancies, the genteel are reduced to poverty, and forced to borrow of tho&s;e whom they formerly de&s;pi&s;ed, but, who through indu&s;try and frugality, have maintained their &s;tanding; in which ca&s;e it appears plainly, that "A ploughman on his legs is higher than a gentleman on his knees," as <HI>Poor Richard</HI> &s;ays. Perhaps they have had a &s;mall e&s;tate left them, which they knew not the getting of; they think, "It is day, and will never be night;" that a little to be &s;pent out of &s;o much is not worth minding; but "Always tak|ing out of the meal-tub, and never putting in, &s;oon comes to the bottom," as <HI>Poor Richard</HI> &s;ays; and then, "When the well is dry, they know the worth of water." But this they might have known before, if they had taken his advice: If you would know the va|lue of money, go and try to borrow &s;ome; for "He that goes a borrowing goes a &s;orrowing," as <HI>Poor Richard</HI> &s;ays; and, indeed, &s;o does he that lends to &s;uch people, when he does not get it again, <HI>Poor D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">k</HI> farther advi&s;es and &s;ays,
<Q><L>Fond pride of dre&s;s is &s;ure a very cur&s;e;</L>
<L>Ere fancy you con&s;ult, con&s;ult your pur&s;e.</L></Q>
And again, "Pride is as loud a beggar as Want, and a great deal more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">cy." When you have bought one fine thing, you mu&s;t buy ten more, that your appearance be all of a-piece; but <HI>Poor Dick</HI> &s;ays, "It is ea&s;ier to &s;uppre&s;s the fir&s;t de&s;ire, than to &s;atisfy all that follow it:" And it is as truly folly for the poor to ape the rich, as for the frog to &s;well, in order to equal the ox.
<Q><L>Ve&s;&s;els large may venture more,</L>
<L>But little boats &s;hould keep near &s;hore.</L></Q>
It is, however, a folly &s;oon puni&s;hed: for, as <HI>Poor Richard</HI> &s;ays, "Pride that dines on vanity, &s;ups on contempt: Pride breakfa&s;ted with plenty, dined with poverty, and &s;upped with infamy." And, after all, of what u&s;e is this pride of appearance, for which &s;o much is ri&s;ked, &s;o much is &s;uffered? It cannot promote health, nor ca&s;e pain; it makes no increa&s;e of merit in a per&s;on; it creates envy; it ha&s;tens misfortune.</P>
<P>'But what madne&s;s mu&s;t it be to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">un in d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">bt</HI> for the&s;e &s;uper&s;tui|ties? We are offered, by the terms of this &s;ale, &s;ix months credit; and that, perhaps, has induced &s;ome of us to attend it, becau&s;e we cannot &s;pare the ready money, and hope now to be fine without it. But ah! think what you do when you run in debt; you give to ano|ther power over your liberty. If you cannot pay at the time, you will be a&s;hamed to &s;ee your creditor; you will be in fear when you &s;peak to him; you will make poor, pitiful, &s;neaking, excu&s;es; and, by degrees, come to lo&s;e your veracity, and &s;ink into ba&s;e downright lying; for "The <HI>&s;econd</HI> vice is lying, the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> is running in debt," as <HI>Poor Richard</HI> &s;ays; and again to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, "Lying rides upon Debt's back;" whereas a free-born American ought not to be a&s;hamed to &s;ee or to &s;peak to any man living. But poverty often deprives a man of all &s;pirit and virtue. "It is hard for an empty bag to &s;tand upright." What would you think of that prince, or of that government, who &s;hould i&s;&s;ue an edict for|bidding you to dre&s;s like a gentleman or gentlewoman, on pain of
<PB N="185" REF="027039_0187_0FD2FB7576CF5B58">
impri&s;onment or &s;ervitude?&mdash;Would you not &s;ay you were free, have a right to dre&s;s as you plea&s;e, and that &s;uch an edict would be a breach of your privileges, and &s;uch a government tyrannical? And yet you are about to put your&s;elf under that tyranny, when you run in debt for &s;uch dre&s;s! Your creditor has authority, at his plea&s;ure, to deprive you of your liberty, by confining you in goal for life, or by &s;elling you for a &s;ervant, if you &s;hould not be able to pay him. When you have got your bargain, you may, perhaps, think little of payment; but as <HI>Poor Richard</HI> &s;ays, "Creditors have bet|ter memories than debtors; creditors are a &s;uper&s;titious &s;ect, great ob&s;ervers of &s;et days and times." The day comes round before you are aware, and the demand is made before you are prepared to &s;atisfy it: or, if you bear your debt in mind, the term which at fir&s;t &s;eemed &s;o long, will, as it le&s;&s;ens, appear extremely &s;hort. Time will &s;eem to have added wings to his heels as well as his &s;houlders. "Tho&s;e have a &s;hort Lent who owe money to be paid at Ea&s;ter." At pre&s;ent, perhaps, you may think your&s;elves in thriving circum&s;tances, and that you can bear a little extravagance without injury: but
<Q><L>For age and want &s;ave while you may,</L>
<L>No morning &s;un la&s;ts a whole day.</L></Q>
Gain may be temporary and uncertain, but ever, while you live, expence is con&s;tant and certain; and, "It is ea&s;ier to build two o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">imnies, than to keep one in fuel," as <HI>Poor Richard</HI> &s;ays: So, "Rather go to bed &s;upperle&s;s than ri&s;e in debt."
<Q><L>Get what you can, and what you get hold,</L>
<L>'Tis the &s;tone that will turn all your lead into gold.</L></Q>
And when you have got the philo&s;opher's &s;tone, &s;ure you will no longer complain of bad times or the difficulty of paying taxes.</P>
<P>IV. 'This doctrine, my friends, is rea&s;on and wi&s;dom: but, after all, do not depend too much upon your own indu&s;try, and frugality, and prudence, though excellent things; for they may all be bla&s;ted without the ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven; and, therefore, a&s;k that ble&s;&s;ing humbly, and be not uncharitable to tho&s;e that at pre|&s;ent &s;eem to want it, but comfort and help them. Remember Job &s;uffered, and was afterwards pro&s;perous.</P>
<P>'And now, to conclude, "Experience keeps a dear &s;chool, but fools will learn in no other," as <HI>Poor Richard</HI> &s;ays, and &s;carce in that; for, it is true, "We may give advice, but we cannot give conduct;" however, remember this, "They that will not be coun|&s;elled, cannot be helped;" and further, that, "If you will not hear Rea&s;on, &s;he will &s;urely rap your knuckles," as <HI>Poor Richard</HI> &s;ays.'</P>

this unaccountable di&s;po&s;ition is in &s;ome manner inherent in the na|ture of man; for as he cannot be taught by example&punc; nor led to it by temptation, or prompted to it by intere&s;t, it mu&s;t be derived from his native con&s;titution; and is a remarkable confirmation of what revelation &s;o frequently inculcates&mdash;that he brings into the world with him an original depravity, the effects of a fallen and de|generate &s;tate; in proof of which we need only ob&s;erve, that the nearer he approaches to a &s;tate of nature, the more predominent this di&s;po&s;ition appears, and the more violently it operates.

<P>To be ever active in laudable pur&s;uits, is the di&s;tingui&s;hing cha|racteri&s;tic of a man of merit. There is an heroic innocence, as well as an heroic courage. There is a mean in all things. Even virtue it&s;elf hath its &s;tated limits; which not being &s;trictly ob&s;erved, it cea&s;es to be virtue.

Money, like manure, does no good till it is &s;pread. There is no real u&s;e of riches, except in the di&s;tribution; the re&s;t is all conceit. A wi&s;e man will de&s;ire no more than what he may get ju&s;tly, u&s;e &s;oberly, di&s;tribute cheerfully, and live upon contentedly. A cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="5 letters"> mind, and a good con&s;cience, will make a man happy in all con|ditions He knows not how to fear, who dares to die. There is but one way of fortifying the &s;oul again&s;t all gloomy pre&s;ages and ter|rors of the mind; and that is, by &s;ecuring to our&s;elves the friend|&s;hip and protection of that Being, who di&s;po&s;es of events, and go|verns futurity. Philo&s;ophy is then only valuable, when it &s;erves for the law of life, and not for the oftentation of &s;cience. Without a friend, the world is but a wilderne&s;s. A man may have a thou|&s;and intimate acquaintances, and not a friend among them all. If you have one friend think your&s;elf happy. When once you pro|fe&s;s your&s;elf a friend, endeavour to be always &s;uch. He can never have any true friends, that will be often changing them. Pro&s;pe|rity gains friends, and adver&s;ity tries them. Nothing more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the affections of men than a hand&s;ome addre&s;s, and graceful conver&s;ation. Complai&s;ance renders a &s;uperior amiable, an equal agreeable, and an inferior acceptable. Exce&s;s of ceremony &s;hows want of breeding. That civility is be&s;t, which excludes all &s;uper|fluous formality. Ingratitude is a crime &s;o &s;hameful, that the man was never yet found, who would acknowledge him&s;elf guilty of it. Truth is born with us; and we mu&s;t do violence to nature to &s;hake off our veracity. There cannot be a greater treachery, than fir&s;t to rai&s;e a confidence, and then deceive it. By others faults wi&s;e men correct their own. No man hath a thorough ta&s;te of pro&s;pe|rity, to whom adver&s;ity never happened. When our vices leave <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> we flatter our&s;elves that we leave them. It is as great a point of wi&s;dom to hide ignorance, as to di&s;cover knowledge.

more glorious victory cannot be gained over another man, than this, that when the injury began on his part, the kindne&s;s &s;hould begin on ours. The prodigal robs his heir, the mi&s;er robs him&s;elf. We &s;hould take a prudent care for the future, but &s;o as to enjoy the pre&s;ent. It is no part of wi&s;dom to be mi&s;erable to-day, becau&s;e we may happen to be &s;o to-morrow. To mourn without mea&s;ure, is folly; not to mourn at all, in&s;en&s;ibility.

A good man will love him&s;elf too well to lo&s;e, and all his neighbours too well to win, an e&s;tate by gaming. The love of gaming will corrupt the be&s;t principles in the world. An angry man who &s;uppre&s;&s;es his pa&s;&s;ions, thinks wor&s;e than he &s;peaks; and an angry man that will chide, &s;peaks wor&s;e than he thinks. A good word is an ea&s;y obligation; but not to &s;peak ill, requires only our &s;ilence, which co&s;ts us nothing. It is to affectation the world owes us whole race of coxcombs. Na|ture in her whole drama never drew &s;uch a part; &s;he has &s;ometimes made a fool, but a cox<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">omb is alway of his own making. It is the infirmity of little minds, to be taken with every appearance, and dazzled with every thing that &s;parkles; but great minds have but little admiration, becau&s;e few things appear new to them.

It is hard|er to avoid cen&s;ure, than to gain applau&s;e; for this may be done by one great or wi&s;e action in an age; but to e&s;cape cen&s;ure, a man mu&s;t pa&s;s his whole life without &s;aying or doing one ill or fooli&s;h thing.

I would accept them. So would I, replied Alexander, were I Parmenio. Nobility is to be con&s;idered only as an imaginary di&s;|tinction, unle&s;s accompanied with the practice of tho&s;e generous virtues by which it ought to be obtained. Titles of honour con|ferred upon &s;uch as have no per&s;onal merit, are at be&s;t but the royal &s;tamp &s;et upon ba&s;e metal. Though an honourable title may be conveyed to po&s;terity, yet the ennobling qualities which are the &s;oul of greatne&s;s, are a &s;ort of incommunicable perfections, and cannot be transferred. If a man could bequeath his virtues by will, and &s;ettle his &s;en&s;e and learning upon his heirs, as certainly as he can his lands, a noble de&s;cent would then indeed be a valu|able privilege. Truth is always con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf, and needs nothing to help it out. It is always near at hand, and &s;its upon our lips, and is ready to drop out before we are aware: whereas a lie is trouble&s;ome, and &s;ets a man's invention upon the rack; and one trick needs a great many more to make it good. The plea&s;ure which affects the human mind with the mo&s;t lively and tran&s;porting touches, is the &s;en&s;e that we act in the eye of infinite wi&s;dom, power, and goodne&s;s, that will crown our virtuous endeavours here with a happine&s;s hereafter, large as our de&s;ires, and la&s;ting as our immortal &s;ouls: without this the highe&s;t &s;tate of life is in&s;ipid, and with it the lowe&s;t is a paradi&s;e. Honourable age is not that which &s;tandeth in length of time, nor that is mea&s;ured by number of years; but wi&s;dom is the grey hair unto man, and un&s;potted life is old age. Wickedne&s;s, condemned by her own witne&s;s, is very timorous, and being pre&s;&s;ed with con&s;cience, always foreca&s;t|eth evil things; for fear is nothing el&s;e but a betraying of the &s;uc|cours which rea&s;on offereth. A wi&s;e man will fear in every thing. He that contemneth &s;mall things, &s;hall fall by little and little. A rich man beginning to fall, is held up of his friends: but a poor man being down, is thru&s;t away by his friends: when a rich man is fallen he hath many helpers; he &s;peaketh things not to be &s;poken, and yet men ju&s;tify him; the poor man &s;lipt, and they rebuke him; he &s;poke wi&s;ely, and could have no place. When a rich man &s;peaketh, every man holdeth his tongue, and, look, what he faith they extol it to the clouds; but if a poor man &s;peaks, they &s;ay, What fellow is this? Many have fallen by the edge of the &s;word, but not &s;o many as have fallen by the tongue. Well is he that is defended from it, and hath not pa&s;&s;ed through the venom thereof; who hath not drawn the yoke thereof, nor been bound is her bounds; for the yoke thereof is a yoke of iron, and the bands thereof are bands of bra&s;s; the death thereof is an evil death. My &s;on, blemi&s;h not thy good deeds, neither u&s;e uncomfortable words, when thou give&s;t any thing. Shall not the dew a&s;&s;uage the heat? &s;o is a word better than a gift. Lo, is not a word better than a gift? but both are with a gracious man. Blame not, before thou ha&s;t examined the truth; under&s;tand fir&s;t, and then rebuke. If thou woulde&s;t get a friend, prove him fir&s;t, and be not ha&s;ty to credit him; for &s;ome men are friends for their own occa&s;ions, and will not abide in the day of thy trouble. For&s;ake not an old friend, for the new is not comparable to him: a new friend is as new wine; when it is old, thou &s;halt drink it with plea&s;ure. A friend cannot be known in pro&s;perity, and an enemy cannot be hidden in

adver&s;ity. Admoni&s;h thy friend; it may be he hath not done it; and if he have, that he do it no more. Admoni&s;h thy friend; it may be he hath not &s;aid it; or if he have, that he &s;peak it not again. Admoni&s;h a friend; for many times it is a &s;lander; and believe not every tale. There is one that &s;lippeth in his &s;peech, but not from his heart; and who is he that hath not offended with his tongue? Who&s;o di&s;covereth &s;ecrets lo&s;eth his credit and &s;hall never find a friend to his mind. Honour thy father with thy whole heart, and forget not the &s;orrows of thy mother! how can&s;t thou recompence them the things that they have done for thee? There is nothing &s;o much worth as a mind well in&s;tructed. The lips of talkers will be telling &s;uch things as pertain not unto them; but the words of &s;uch as have under&s;tanding are weighed in the balance. The heart of fools is in their mouth, but the tongue of the wi&s;e is in their heart. To labour, and to be content with that a man hath, is a &s;weet life. Be at peace with many; neverthele&s;s, have but one coun&s;ellor of a thou&s;and. Be not confident in a plain way. Let rea&s;on go before every enterprize, and coun&s;el before every action. The latter part of a wi&s;e man's life is taken up in curing the fol|lies, prejudices, and fal&s;e opinions he had contracted in the former. Cen&s;ure is the tax a man pays to the public for being eminent. Very few men, properly &s;peaking, live at pre&s;ent, but are providing to live another time. Party is the madne&s;s of many, for the gain of a few. To endeavour to work upon the vulgar with fine &s;en&s;e, is like attempting to hew blocks of marble with a razor. Super|&s;tition is the &s;pleen of the &s;oul. He who tells a lie, is not &s;en&s;ible how great a ta&s;k he undertakes; for he mu&s;t be forced to invent twenty more to maintain that one. Some people will never learn any thing, for this rea&s;on, becau&s;e they under&s;tand every thing too &s;oon. There is nothing wanting, to make all rational and di&s;in|tere&s;ted people in the world of one religion, but that they &s;hould talk together every day. Men are grateful, in the &s;ame degree that they are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">entful. Young men are &s;ubtle arguers; the cloak of honour covers all their faults, as that of pa&s;&s;ion all their follies. Oeconomy is no di&s;grace; it is better living on a little, than outliving a great deal. Next to the &s;atisfaction I receive in the pro&s;perity of an hone&s;t man, I am be&s;t plea&s;ed with the confu&s;ion of a ra&s;cal. What is often termed &s;hyne&s;s, is nothing more than refined &s;en&s;e, and an indifference to common ob&s;ervations. The higher character a per&s;on &s;upports, the more he &s;hould regard his minute&s;t actions. Every per&s;on in&s;en&s;ibly fixes upon &s;ome degree of refinement in his di&s;cour&s;e, &s;ome mea&s;ure of thought which he thinks worth exhibiting. It is wi&s;e to fix this pretty high, although it occa&s;ions one to talk the le&s;s. To endeavour all one's days to fortify our minds with learning and philo&s;ophy, is to &s;pend &s;o much in armour, that one has nothing left to defend. Deference often &s;hrinks and withers as much upon the approach of intimacy, as the &s;en&s;itive plant does upon the touch of one's finger. Men are &s;ometimes accu&s;ed of pride, merely becau&s;e their accu&s;ers would be proud them&s;elves if they were in their places. People frequently u&s;e this expre&s;&s;ion, I am inclined to think &s;o and &s;o, not con&s;ider|ing that they are then &s;peaking the mo&s;t literal of all truths.

under it, by the prejudice it affords every worthy per&s;on in their favour. The difference there is betwixt honour and hone&s;ty &s;eems to be chiefly in the motive. The hone&s;t man does that from duty, which the man of honour does for the &s;ake of character. A liar begins with making fal&s;ehood appear like truth, and ends with making truth it&s;elf appear like fal&s;ehood. Virtue &s;hould be con&s;i|dered as a part of ta&s;te; and we &s;hould as much avoid deceit, or &s;ini&s;ter meanings in di&s;cour&s;e, as we would puns, bad language, or fal&s;e grammar. Deference is the mo&s;t complicate, the mo&s;t indi|rect, and the mo&s;t elegant of all compliments. He that lies in bed all a &s;ummer's morning, lo&s;es the chief plea&s;ure of the day; he that gives up his youth to indolence, undergoes a lo&s;s of the &s;ame kind. Shining characters are not always the mo&s;t agreeable ones: the mild radiance of an emerald is by no means le&s;s plea&s;ing than the glare of the ruby. To be at once a rake, and to glory in the character, di&s;covers at the &s;ame time a bad di&s;po&s;ition and a bad ta&s;te. How is it po&s;&s;ible to expect that mankind will take advice, when they will not &s;o much as take warning? Although men are accu&s;ed for not knowing their own weakne&s;s, yet, perhaps, as few know their own &s;trength. It is in men as in &s;oils, where &s;ome|times there is a vein of gold which the owner knows not of. Fine &s;en&s;e, and exalted &s;en&s;e, are not half &s;o valuable as common &s;en&s;e. There are forty m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n of wit for one man of &s;en&s;e; and he that will carry nothing about him but gold, will be every day at a lo&s;s for want of ready change. Learning is like mercury, one of the mo&s;t powerful and excellent things in the world in &s;kilful hands; in un|&s;kilful, mo&s;t mi&s;chievous. A man &s;hould never be a&s;hamed to own he has been in the wrong; which is but &s;aying in other words, that he is wi&s;er to-day than he was ye&s;terday. Wherever I find a great deal of gratitude in a poor man, I take it for granted there would be as much genero&s;ity if he were a rich man. Flowers of rhetoric in &s;ermons or &s;erious di&s;cour&s;es, are like the blue and red flowers in corn, plea&s;ing to tho&s;e who come only for amu&s;ement, but prejudicial to him who would reap the profit. It often hap|pens, that tho&s;e are the be&s;t people, who&s;e characters have been mu&s;t injured by &s;landerers: as we u&s;ually find that to be the &s;weet|e&s;t fruit which the birds have been pecking at. The eye of a critic is often like a micro&s;cope, made &s;o very fine and nice, that it di&s;|covers the atoms, grains, and minute&s;t particles, without ever com|prehending the whole, comparing the parts, or &s;eeing all at once the harmony. Men's zeal for religion is much of the &s;ame kind as that which they &s;how for a foot-ball; whenever it is conte&s;ted for, every one is ready, to venture their lives and limbs in the di&s;pute: but when that is once at an end, it is no more thought on, but &s;leeps in oblivion, buried in rubbi&s;h, which no one thinks it worth his pains to rake into, much le&s;s to remove. Honour is but a fic|tious kind of hone&s;ty; a mean, but a nece&s;&s;ary &s;ub&s;titute for it, in &s;ocieties that have none; it is a &s;ort of paper-credit, with which men are obliged to trade who are deficient in the &s;terling ca&s;h of true morality and religion.

<P>HE who &s;erves God hath the be&s;t ma&s;ter in the world. Where God is there is nothing wanting. No man is greater in truth than he is in God's e&s;teem.

He who lives di&s;orderly one year, doth not enjoy him&s;elf for five years after. Friend&s;hips are cheap, when they are to be bought with pulling off your hat. Speak well of your friend, of your enemy neither well nor ill. The friend&s;hip of a great man is a lion at the next door. The money you refu&s;e will never do you good. A beggar's wallet is a mile to the bottom. I once had, is a poor man. There are a great many a&s;&s;es without long ears. An iron anvil &s;hould have a hammer of feathers. He keeps his road well enough who gets rid of bad company. You are in debt, and run in farther; if you are not a liar yet, you will be one. The be&s;t throw upon the dice is to throw them away. 'Tis horribly dangerous to &s;leep near the gates of hell. He who thinks to cheat another, cheats him&s;elf mo&s;t. Giving is going a fi&s;hing. Too much pro&s;perity makes mo&s;t men fools. Dead men op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n the eyes of the living. No man's head akes while he comforts another. Bold and &s;hamele&s;s men are ma&s;ters of half the world.

Hunger never fails of a good cook. A man is valued as he makes him&s;elf valuable. Three littles make a man rich on a &s;udden; little wit, little &s;hame, and little hone&s;ty. He who hath good health is a rich man, and doth not know it. Give a wi&s;e man a hint, and he will do the bu&s;ine&s;s well enough. A bad agreement is better than a good law-&s;uit.

From an a&s;s you can get nothing but kicks and &s;tench. Either &s;ay nothing of the ab&s;ent, or &s;peak like a friend. One man forewarned (or appri&s;ed of a thing) is worth two. He is truly happy who can make others happy too. A fair woman without virtue is like palled wine. Tell a woman &s;he is wondrous fair, and &s;he will &s;oon turn fool. Paint and patches give offence to the hu&s;band, hopes to the gallant. He that would be well &s;poken o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> him&s;elf, mu&s;t not &s;peak ill of others. He that doth the kindne&s;s hath the noble&s;t plea&s;ure of the two. He who doth a kindne&s;s to a good man, doth greater to him&s;elf. A man's hat in his hand never did him harm. One cap or hat more or le&s;s, and one quire of paper in a year, co&s;t but little and will make you many friends. He who blames grandees endangers his head, and he who prai&s;es them mu&s;t tell many a lie. A wi&s;e man goes not on board without due provi&s;ion. Keep your mouth &s;hut, and your eyes open. He who will &s;top every man's mouth mu&s;t have a great deal of meal. Wi&s;e men have their mouth in their heart, fools their heart in their mouth. Show not to all the bottom either of your pur&s;e or of your mind. I heard one &s;ay &s;o, is half a lie. Lies have very &s;hort legs. One lie draws ten more after it. Keep company with good men, and you'll increa&s;e their number. He is a good man who is good for him&s;elf, but he is good indeed who is &s;o for others too. When you meet with a virtuous man, draw his picture. He who keeps good men company may very well bear their charges. He begins to grow bad who takes him|&s;elf to be a good man. He is far from a good man who &s;trives not to grow better. Keep good men company, and fall not out with the bad. He who throws away his e&s;tate with his hands, goes af|terwards to pick up on his feet. 'Tis a bad hou&s;e that hath not an old man in it. To crow well and &s;crape ill is the devil's trade. Be ready with your hat, but &s;low with your pur&s;e. A burthen which one choo&s;es is not felt. The dearer &s;uch a thing is, the bet|ter penny worth for me.

A good law|yer is a bad neighbour. He who pays well, is ma&s;ter of every body's pur&s;e. Another man's bread co&s;ts very dear. Have you bread and wine? &s;ing and be merry. If there is but little bread, keep it in your hand; if but little wine, drink often; if but a little bed, go to bed early, and clap your&s;elf down in the middle. 'Tis good keeping his clothes who goes to &s;wim. A man's own opini|on is never in the wrong. He who &s;peaks little, needs but half &s;o much brains as a talkative man. He who knows mo&s;t, commonly &s;peaks lea&s;t. Few men take his advice who talks a great deal. He that is going to &s;peak ill of another, let him con&s;ider him&s;elf well; and he will hold his peace. Eating little and &s;peaking little, can never do a man hurt. A civil an&s;wer to a rude &s;peech co&s;ts not much, and is worth a great deal. Speaking without thinking is &s;hooting without taking aim.

Give every man good words, but keep your pur&s;e-&s;trings clo&s;e. Fine words will not keep a cat from &s;tarving. He that hath no patience, hath nothing at all. No patience, no true wi&s;dom. Make one bargain with other men, but make four with your&s;elf. There is no fool to a learned fool. The fir&s;t de|gree of folly is to think one's &s;elf wi&s;e; the next to tell others &s;o: the third to de&s;pi&s;e all coun&s;el. If wi&s;e men play the fool, they do it with a vengeance. One fool in one hou&s;e is enough in all con&s;cience. He is not a thorough wi&s;e man who cannnot play the fool on a ju&s;t occa&s;ion. A wi&s;e man doth that at the fir&s;t which a fool mu&s;t do at the la&s;t. Men's years and their faults are always more than they are willing to own.

He that parts with what he ought, lo&s;es nothing by the &s;hift. Forgive eve|ry man's faults except your own. To forgive injuries is a noble and God-like revenge. 'Tis a mark of great proficiency, to bear ea&s;i|ly the failings of other men. Fond love of a man's &s;elf &s;hows that he doth not know him&s;elf. That which a man likes well is half done. He who is u&s;ed to do kindne&s;&s;es, always finds them when he &s;tands in need. A wi&s;e lawyer never goes to law him|&s;elf.

I will do what I can, and a little le&s;s, that I may hold out the better. Tru&s;t &s;ome few, but beware of all men. He that knows but little, pre&s;ently outs with it. He that doth not mind &s;mall things will never get a great deal. John Do-little was the &s;on of Good-wife Spin-little. To know how to be content with a little, is not a mor&s;el for a fool's mouth. That is never to be called little, which a man thinks to be enough. Of two cowards, he hath the better who fir&s;t finds the other out. The wor&s;t pig often gets the be&s;t pear. The devil turns his back, when he finds <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> door &s;hut again&s;t him. The wi&s;er man yields to him who is more than his match. He who thinks he can do mo&s;t, is mo&s;t mi&s;taken. The wi&s;e di&s;cour&s;es of a poor man go for nothing. Poor folks have neither any kindred nor any friends. Good preachers give their hearers fruit, not flowers. Woe to tho&s;e preachers who li&s;ten not to them&s;elves. He who quakes for cold, either wants money to buy him clothes, or wit to put them on. Poverty is a good hated by all men. He that would have a thing done quickly and well, mu&s;t do it him&s;elf. He who knows mo&s;t is the lea&s;t pre&s;uming or confident. 'Tis more noble to make your|&s;elf great, than to be born &s;o. The beginning of an amour (or gal|lantry) is fear, the middle &s;in, and the end &s;orrow or repentance. The beginning only of a thing is hard, and co&s;ts dear. A fair promi&s;e catches the fool. He who is bound for another goes in at the wide end of the horn, and mu&s;t come out at the narrow if he can. Promi&s;ing is not with the de&s;ign to give, but to plea&s;e fools. Give no great credit to a great promi&s;er. Pro&s;perity is the wor&s;t enemy men u&s;ually have. Proverbs bear age, and he who would do well may view him&s;elf in them as in a looking-gla&s;s. A pro|verb is the child of experience. He that makes no reckoning of a farthing, will not be worth one half-penny. Avoid carefully the fir&s;t ill or mi&s;chief, for that will breed an hundred more. Rea&s;on governs the wi&s;e man, and a cudgel the fool. Suffering is the mother of fools, rea&s;on of wi&s;e men. If you would be as happy as any king, con&s;ider not the few that are before, but the many that come behind you. Our religion and our language we &s;uck in with our milk. Love, knavery, and nece&s;&s;ity, make men good orators. There is no fence again&s;t what comes from heaven. Good hu&s;bandry is the fir&s;t &s;tep towards riches. A flock once gotten, wealth grows up of its own accord. Wealth hides many a great fault. Good ware was never dear, nor a mi&s;s ever worth the money &s;he co&s;ts.

Wealth is his that enjoys it, and the world is his who &s;crambles for it. A father with very great wealth, and a &s;on with no virtue at all. Little wealth, and little care and trouble. The Roman conquers by &s;itting &s;till at home. Between robbing and re&s;toring, men commonly get thirty in the hundred. He is learned enough who knows how to live well. The more a man knows, the le&s;s credulous he is. There is no harm in de&s;iring to be thought wi&s;e by others, but a great deal in a man's thinking him&s;elf to be &s;o. Bare wages never made a &s;ervant rich. Lo&s;ing much breeds bad blood. Health without any money is half &s;ickne&s;s. When a man is tumbling down, every &s;aint lends a hand. He that un&s;ea&s;onab|ly plays the wi&s;e man is a fool. He that pretends too much to wi&s;dom is counted a fool. A wi&s;e man never &s;ets his heart upon what he cannot have. A lewd batchelor makes a jealous hu&s;band. That crown is well &s;pent which &s;aves you ten. Love can do much, but &s;corn or di&s;dain can do more. If you would have a thing kept &s;ecret, never tell it to any one; and if you would not have a thing known of you, never do it. Whatever you are going to do or &s;ay, think well fir&s;t what may be the con&s;equence of it. They are always &s;elling wit to others who have lea&s;t of it for them|&s;elves. He that gains time gains a great point. Every ditch is full of after-wit. A little wit will &s;erve a fortunate man. The fa|vour of a court is like fair weather in winter. Neither take for a &s;ervant him whom you mu&s;t entreat, nor a kin&s;man, nor a friend, if you would have a good one! A man never lo&s;es by doing good offices to others. He that would be well &s;erved, mu&s;t know when to change his &s;ervants. Ignorance and pro&s;perity make men bold and confident. He who employs <HI>one</HI> &s;ervant in any bu&s;ine&s;s, hath him <HI>all</HI> there; who employs TWO, hath <HI>half</HI> a &s;ervant; who THREE <HI>hath never a one.</HI> Either a civil grant, or civil denial. When you have any bu&s;ine&s;s with a man give him title enough. The covetous man is the bailiff, not the ma&s;ter, of his own e&s;tate. Trouble not your head about the weather, or the government. Like with like, looks well, and la&s;ts long. All worldly joy is but a &s;hort-lived dream. That is a cur&s;ed plea&s;ure that makes a man a fool. The &s;oldier is well paid for doing mi&s;chief. A &s;oldier, fire, and water, &s;oon make room for them&s;elves. A con&s;idering careful man is half a conjurer. A man would not be alone even in paradi&s;e. One nap finds out, or draws on another. Have good luck, and you may lie in bed. He that will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> every thing mu&s;t have his &s;word always ready drawn. That hou&s;e is in an ill ca&s;e where the di&s;taff commands the &s;word. One &s;word keeps an|other in the &s;cabbard. He that &s;peaks ill of other men, burns his own tongue. He that is mo&s;t liberal where he &s;hould be &s;o, is the be&s;t hu&s;band. He is gainer enough who gives over a vain hope. A mighty hope is a mighty cheat. Hope is a plea&s;ant kind of de|ceit.

of him&s;elf, mu&s;t not expect it from others. Indu&s;try makes a gal|lant man, and breaks ill fortune. Study, like a &s;taff of cotton, beats without noi&s;e. Mother-in-law and daughter-in-law are a tempe&s;t and hail-&s;torm. If pride were a deadly di&s;ea&s;e, how ma|ny would now be in their graves? He who cannot hold his peace will never live at ea&s;e. A fool will be always talking right or wrong. In &s;ilence there is many a good mor&s;el. Pray hold your peace, or you will make me fall a&s;leep. The table, a &s;ecret thief, &s;ends its ma&s;ter to the ho&s;pital. Begin your web, and God will &s;upply you with thread. Too much fear is an enemy to good de|liberation. As &s;oon as God hath a church built for him, the de|vil gets a tabernacle &s;et up for him&s;elf. Time is a file that wears and makes no noi&s;e. Nothing is &s;o hard to bear well as pro&s;peri|ty. Patience, time, and money, &s;et every thing to rights. The true art of making gold is to have a good e&s;tate, and to &s;pend but little of it. Abate two thirds of all the reports you hear. A fair face, or a fine head, and very little brains in it. He who lives wickedly lives always in fear. A beautiful face is a plea&s;ing trai|tor. If three know it, all the world will know it too. Many have too much, but nobody hath enough. An hone&s;t man hath half as much more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> as he needs, a knave hath not half enough. A wi&s;e man changes his mind when there is rea&s;on for it. From hearing, comes wi&s;dom; and from &s;peaking, repentance. Old age is an evil de&s;ired by all men, and youth an advantage which no young man under&s;tands. He that would have a good revenge, let him leave it to God. Would you be revenged on your enemy? live as you ought, and you have done it to purpo&s;e. He that will revenge every affront, either falls from a good po&s;t, or never gets up to it. Truth is an inhabitant of heaven. That which &s;eems probable is the greate&s;t enemy to the truth. A thou&s;and probabi|lities cannot make one truth. 'Tis no great pains to &s;peak the truth. That is mo&s;t true which we lea&s;t care to hear. Truth hath the plague in his hou&s;e (i. e. is carefully avoided). A wi&s;e man will not tell &s;uch a truth as every one will take for a lie. Long voyages occa&s;ion great lies. The world makes men drunk as much as wine doth. Wine and youth are fire upon fire. Enrich your younger age with virtuous lore. 'Tis virtue's picture which we find in books. Virtue mu&s;t be our trade and &s;tudy, not our chance. We &s;hall have a hou&s;e without a fault in the next world. Tell me what life you lead, and I will tell you how you &s;hall die. He is in a low form who never thinks beyond this &s;hort life. Vices are learned without a teacher. Wicked men are dead whil&s;t they live. He is rich who de&s;ires nothing more! To recover a bad man is a double kindne&s;s of virtue. Who are you for?

mind to &s;ay, hears what he hath no mind to hear. That city thrives be&s;t where virtue is mo&s;t e&s;teemed and rewarded. He cannot go wrong whom virtue guides. The &s;word kills many, but wine, many more. 'Tis truth which makes the man angry. He who tells all the truth he knows mu&s;t lie in the &s;treets. Oil and truth will get uppermo&s;t at the la&s;t. A probable &s;tory is the be&s;t wea|pon of calumny. He counts very un&s;kilfully who leaves God out of his reckoning. Nothing is of any great value but God only. All is good that God &s;ends us. He that hath children, all his mor&s;els are nor his own. Thought is a nimble footman. Many know every thing el&s;e, but nothing at all of them&s;elves. We ought not to give the fine flour to the devil, and the bran to God. Six feet of earth make all men of one &s;ize. He that is born of a hen mu&s;t &s;crape for his living. Afflictions draw men up towards heaven. That which does us good is never too late. Since my hou&s;e mu&s;t be burnt I will warm my&s;elf at it. Tell every body your bu&s;ine&s;s and the devil will do it for you. A man was hanged for &s;aying what was true. Do not all that you can do; &s;pend not all that you have; believe not all that you hear; and tell not all that you know. A man &s;hould learn to &s;ail with all winds. He is the man indeed who can govern him&s;elf as he ought. He that would live long, mu&s;t &s;ometimes change his cour&s;e of life. When children are little they make their parents heads ake; and when they are grown up, they make their hearts ake. To preach well, you mu&s;t fir&s;t practi&s;e what you teach others. U&s;e or practice of a thing is the be&s;t ma&s;ter. A man that hath learning is worth two who have it not. A fool knows his own bu&s;ine&s;s better than a wi&s;e man doth anothers. He who under&s;tands mo&s;t is other men's ma&s;ter. Have a care of&mdash;Had I known this before.&mdash;Command your &s;ervant, and do it your&s;elf, and you will have le&s;s trouble. You may know the ma&s;ter by his man. He who &s;erves the pub|lic hath but a &s;curvy ma&s;ter; He that would have good offices done to him, mu&s;t do them to others: 'Tis the only true liberty to &s;erve our good God. The common &s;oldier's blood makes the ge|neral a great man. An huge great hou&s;e is an huge great trouble. Never advi&s;e a man to go to the wars, nor to marry. Go to the war with as many as you can, and with as few to coun&s;el. 'Tis bet|ter keeping out of a quarrel, than to make it up afterwards. Great birth is a very poor di&s;h on the table. Neither buy any thing of, or &s;ell to, your friend. Sickne&s;s or di&s;ea&s;es are vi&s;its from God. Sickne&s;s is a per&s;onal citation before our Judge. Beauty and folly do not often part company. Beauty beats a call upon a dram. Teeth placed before the tongue give good advice. A great many pair of &s;hoes are worn out before men do all they &s;ay. A great many words will not fill a pur&s;e. Make a &s;low an&s;wer to an ha&s;ty que&s;tion. Self|prai&s;e is the ground of hatred. Speaking ill of one another is the fifth element men are made up of. When a man &s;peaks you fair, look to your pur&s;e. Play not with a man till you hurt him, nor je&s;t till you &s;hame him. Eating more than you &s;hould at once, makes you eat le&s;s after wards. He makes his grief light who thinks it &s;o. He thinks but ill who does not think twice of a thing. He who goes about a thing him&s;elf, hath a mind to have it done; who &s;ends another, cares not whether it be done or no. There is no di&s;cre|tion
<PB N="204" REF="027039_0206_0FD2FB92AC5DA698">
in love nor coun&s;el in anger. The fir&s;t &s;tep a man makes to|wards being good, is to know he is not &s;o already. He who is bad to his relations is wor&s;e to him&s;elf, 'Tis good to know our friend's failings, but not to publi&s;h them. A man may &s;ee his own faults in tho&s;e which others do. 'Tis the virtue of &s;aints to be al|ways going on from one kind and degree of virtue to another. A man may talk like a wi&s;e man, and yet act like a fool. Every one thinks he hath more than his &s;hare of brains. The fir&s;t chapter (or point) of fools is to think they are wi&s;e men. Di&s;cretion or a true judgment of things, is the parent of all virtue. Cha&s;tity is the chief and mo&s;t charming beauty. Little con&s;cience and great diligence make a rich man. Never count four except you have them in your bag. Open your door to a fair day, but make your&s;elf ready for a foul one. A little too late is too late &s;till. A good man is ever at home wherever he chance to be. Building is a word that men pay dear for. If you would be healthful, clothe your&s;elf warm, and eat &s;paringly. Rich men are &s;laves con|demned to the mines. Many men's e&s;tates come in at the doors, and go out at the chimney. Wealth is more dear to men than their blood or life is. Foul dirty water makes the river great. That great &s;aint intere&s;t rules the world alone. Their power and their will are the mea&s;ures princes take of right and wrong. In govern|ing others you mu&s;t do what you can do, not all you would do. A wi&s;e man will &s;tay for a convenient &s;ea&s;on, and will bend a little, rather than be torn up by the roots. Ever buy your wit at other men's charges. You mu&s;t let your phlegm &s;ubdue your choler, if you would not &s;poil your bu&s;ine&s;s. Take not phy&s;ic when you are well, le&s;t you die to be better. Do not do evil to get good by it, which never yet happened to any. That plea&s;ure's much too dear which is bought with any pain. To live poor that a man may die rich, is to be the king of fools, or a fool in grain. Good wine makes a bad head, and a long &s;tory. Be as ea&s;y as you can in this world, provided you take good care to be happy in the next. Live well and be cheerful. A man knows no more to any purpo&s;e than he practi&s;es. He that doth mo&s;t at once, doth lea&s;t. He is a wretch who&s;e hopes are below. Thank you, good pu&s;s, &s;tarved my cat. No great good comes without looking after it. Gather the ro&s;e; and leave the thorn behind. He who would be rich in one year is hanged at &s;ix months end. He who hath a mouth will certainly eat. Go early to the market, and as late as ever you can to a battle. The barber learns to &s;have at the beards of fools. He who is lucky (or rich) pa&s;&s;es for a wi&s;e man too. He commands enough who is ruled by a wi&s;e man. He who re|veals his &s;ecret makes him&s;elf a &s;lave. Gaming &s;hows what metal a man is made of. How can the cat help it if the maid be a fool? Fools grow up apace without any watering. God &s;upplies him with more who lays out his e&s;tate well. The printing pre&s;s is the mother of errors. Let me &s;ee your man dead, and I will tell you how rich he is. Men live one half of the year with art and deceit, and the other half with deceit and and art. Do your&s;elf a kindne&s;s, &s;ir.

<P>He is a rich man who hath God for his friend. He is the be&s;t &s;cholar who hath learned to live well. A handful of mother wit is worth a bu&s;hel of learning. When all men &s;ay you are an a&s;s, 'tis time to bray. Change of weather finds di&s;cour&s;e for fools. A pound of care will not pay an ounce of debt. The &s;orrow men have for others hangs upon one hair. A wi&s;e man changes his mind, a fool never will. That day on which you marry you either manor make your&s;elf. God comes to &s;ee, or look upon us, without a bell. You had better leave your enemy &s;omething when you die, than live to beg of your friend. That's a wi&s;e delay which makes the road &s;afe. Cure your &s;ore eyes only with your elbow. Let us thank God, and be content with what we have. The foot of the owner is the be&s;t manure for his land. He is my friend who grinds at my mill. Enjoy that little you have while the fool is hunting for more. Saying and doing do not dine together. Mo|ney cures all di&s;ea&s;es. A life ill-&s;pent makes a &s;ad old-age. 'Tis money that makes men lords. We talk, but God doth what he plea&s;es. May you have good luck, my &s;on, and a little wit will &s;erve your turn. Gifts break through &s;tone walls. Go not to your doctor for every all, nor to your lawyer for every quarrel, nor to your pitcher for every thir&s;t. There is no better looking-gla&s;s than an old true friend. A wall between both be&s;t pre&s;erves friend&s;hip. The &s;um of all is, to &s;erve God well, and to do no ill thing. The creditor always hath a better memory than the debtor. Setting down in writing is a la&s;ting memory. Repentance always co&s;ts very dear. Good-breeding and money make our &s;ons gentlemen. As you u&s;e your father, &s;o your children will u&s;e you. There is no evil, but &s;ome good u&s;e may be made of it. No price is great enough for good coun&s;el. Examine not the pedigree nor patrimo|ny of a good man. There is no ill thing in Spain but that which can &s;peak. Prai&s;e the man who&s;e bread you eat. God keep me from him whom I tru&s;t, from him whom I tru&s;t not I &s;hall keep my&s;elf. Keep out of an ha&s;ty man's way for a while, out of a &s;ul|len man's all the days of your life. If you love me, John, your deeds would tell me &s;o. I defy all &s;etters, though they were made of gold. Few die of hunger, a hundred thou&s;and of &s;urfeits. Go|vern your&s;elf by rea&s;on, though &s;ome like it, others do not.

good hu&s;band. The fool fell in love with the lady's laced apron. The friar who a&s;ks for God's &s;ake, a&s;ks for him&s;elf too. God keep him who takes what care he can of him&s;elf. Nothing is va|luable in this world, except as it tends to the next. Smoke, rain|ing into the hou&s;e, and a talking wife, make a man run out of doors. There is no to-morrow for an a&s;king friend. God keep me from &s;till-water, from that which is rough I will keep my&s;elf. Take your wife's fir&s;t advice, not her &s;econd. Tell not what you know, judge not what you &s;ee, and you will live in quiet. Hear rea&s;on, of &s;he will make her&s;el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> be heard, Gifts enter every where without a wimble. A great fortune with a wife is a bed full of brambles. One penny for your pur&s;e, and two for your mouth. There was never but one man who never did a fault. He who promi&s;es runs into debt. He who holds his peace gathers &s;tones. Leave your &s;on a good reputation and an employment. Receive your money before you give a receipt for it, and take a receipt be|fore you pay it. God doth the cure, and the phy&s;ician takes the money for it. Thinking is very far from knowing the truth, Fools make great fea&s;ts, and wife men eat of them. June, July, Au|gu&s;t, and Carthagena, are the four be&s;t ports of Spain. A gentle calf &s;ucks her own mother, and four cows more (between two own brothers, two witne&s;&s;es, and a notary). The devil brings a mode&s;t man to the court. He who will have a mule without any fault, mu&s;t keep none. The wolves cat the poor a&s;s that hath many owners. Vi&s;it your aunt, but not every day in the year. In an hundred years time, princes are pea&s;ants; and in an hundred and ten, pea&s;ants grow princes. The poor cat is whipped becau&s;e our dame will not &s;pin. Leave your je&s;t whil&s;t you are mo&s;t plea&s;ed with it. Whither goe&s;t thou, grief? Where I am u&s;ed to go. Leave a dog and a great talker in the middle of the &s;treet. Never tru&s;t a man whom you have injured. The laws go on the king's errands. Pa|rents love indeed, others only ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">k of it. Three helping one ano|ther will do as much as &s;ix men &s;ingle. She &s;pins well who breeds her children well. You cannot do better for your daughter than to breed her virtuou&s;ly, nor for your &s;on than to fit him for an employment. Lock your door, that &s;o you may keep your neigh|bour hone&s;t. Civil obliging language co&s;ts but little, and doth a great deal of good. One "Take it" is better than two "Thou &s;ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t have it." Prayers and provender never hindered any man's journey. There is a fig at Rome for him who gives another advice before he a&s;ks it. He who is not more, or better than an another, de&s;erves not more than another. He who hath no wi&s;dom hath no worth. 'Tis better to be a wi&s;e than a rich man. Becau&s;e I would live quietly in the world, I hear, and &s;ee, and &s;ay nothing. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> not between two brothers. The dead and the ab&s;ent have no friends left them. Who is the true friend, or gentleman? He whole actions make him &s;o. Do well to whom you will; do any man harm, and look to your&s;elf. Good courage breaks ill luck to pieces. Great poverty is no fault or ba&s;ene&s;s, but &s;ome inconvenience. The hard-hearted man gives more than he who has nothing at all. Let us not fall out, to give the devil a dinner. Truths too fine &s;pun are &s;ubtle fooleries. If you would always have money, keep it when you have it. I &s;u&s;pect that ill in others

Think of your&s;elf, and let me alone. He can never enjoy him&s;elf one day who fears he may die at night. He who hath done ill once, will do it again. No evil happens to us but what may do us good It I have broke my leg, who knows but 'tis be&s;t for me. The more honour we have, the more we thir&s;t after it. If you would be pope, you mu&s;t think of nothing el&s;e. Make the night night, and the day day, and you will be merry and wi&s;e. He who eats mo&s;t eats lea&s;t. If you would live in health be old betimes. I will go warm, and let fools laugh on. Choo&s;e your wife on a Saturday not on a Sun|day. Drinking water neither makes a man &s;ick nor in debt, nor his wi&s;e a widow. No pottage is good without bacon no &s;ermon without St. Augu&s;tin. Have many acquaintance, and but a few friends. A wondrous fair woman is not all her hu&s;band's own. He who marries a widow, will have a dead man's head often thrown in his di&s;h. Away goes the devil when he finds the door &s;hut again&s;t him. 'Tis great courage to &s;uffer, and great wi&s;dom to bear patiently. Doing what I ought &s;ecures me again&s;t all cen&s;ure, I wept when I was born, and every day &s;hows why. Experience and wi&s;dom are the two be&s;t fortune-tellers. The be&s;t &s;oldier comes from the plough. Wine wears no breeches. The hole in the wall invites the thief. A wi&s;e man doth not hang his wi&s;dom on a peg. A man's love and his belief are &s;een by what he does. A covetous man makes a half-penny of a farthing, and a liberal man makes &s;ix-pence of it. In December keep your&s;elf warm and &s;leep. He who will revenge every affront, means not to live long. Keep your money, niggard, live mi&s;erably that your heir may &s;quander it away. In war, hunting, and love, you have a thou&s;and &s;orrows for every joy or plea&s;ure. Honour and profit will not keep both in one &s;ack. The anger of brothers is the anger of devils A mule and a woman do be&s;t by fair means A very great beauty is either a fool or proud. Look upon a picture and a battle at a great di&s;|tance. A great deal is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> waited, and a little would do as well. An e&s;tate well got is &s;pent, and that which is ill got de&s;troys its ma&s;ter too. That which is bought cheap is the deare&s;t. 'Tis more trouble to do ill than to do well. The hu&s;band mu&s;t not &s;ee, and the wife mu&s;t be blind. While the tall maid is &s;tooping the little one hath &s;wept the hou&s;e. Neither &s;o fair as to kill nor &s;o ugly as to fright a man. May no greater ill befall you than to have many children, and but a little bread for them. Let nothing affright you but &s;in. I am no river, but can go back when there is rea&s;on for it. Do not make me ki&s;s, and you will not make me &s;in. Vain-glory is a flower which never comes to fruit. The ab&s;ent are always in the fault. A great good was never got with a little pains. Sloth is the key to let in beggary. I left him I knew, for him who was highly prai&s;ed, and I found rea&s;on to repent it. Do not &s;ay I will never drink of this water, however dirty it is. He who trifles away his time, perceives not death which &s;tands upon his &s;houlders. He who &s;pits again&s;t heaven, it falls upon his face. He who &s;tumbles, and falls not, mends his pace. He who is &s;ick of folly recovers late or never. He who hath a mouth of his own

&s;hould not bid another man blow. He who hath no ill fortune is tired out with good. He who depends wholly upon another's providing for him, hath but an ill breakfa&s;t, and a wor&s;e &s;upper. A cheerful look, and forgivene&s;s, is the be&s;t revenge of an affront. The reque&s;t of a grandee is a kind of force upon a man. I am al|ways for the &s;tronge&s;t &s;ide.

The clown was angry, and he paid dear for it. If you are vexed or angry, you will have two troubles in&s;tead of one. The la&s;t year was ever better than the pre&s;ent. That wound that was never given is be&s;t cured of any other. Afflictions teach much, but they are a hard cruel ma&s;ter. Improve rather by other men's errors, than find fault with them. Since you can bear with your own, bear with other men's failings too. Men lay out all their under&s;tanding in &s;tudying to know one another, and &s;o no man knows him&s;elf. The applau&s;e of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> or multitude is but a poor comfort. Truths and ro&s;es have thorns about them.

Sleep makes every man as great and rich as the greate&s;t. Follow, but do not run after good fortune. Anger is the weakne&s;s of the under&s;tanding. Great po&s;ts and offices are like ivy on the wall, which makes it look fine, but ruins it. Make no great ha&s;te to be angry; for if there be occa&s;ions, you will have time enough for it.

To heap fre&s;h kindne&s;&s;es upon un|grateful men, is the wi&s;e&s;t, but withal the mo&s;t cruel revenge. The fool's plea&s;ures co&s;t him very dear. Contempt of a man is the &s;harpe&s;t reproof. Wit without di&s;cretion is a &s;word in the hand of a fool. Other virtues without prudence are a blind beau|ty. Neither inquire after, nor hear of, nor take notice of the faults of others, when you &s;ee them. Years pa&s;s not over men's heads for nothing. An halter will &s;ooner come without taking my care about it, than a canonry. If all a&s;&s;es wore pack &s;addles, what a good trade would the pack &s;addlers have. The u&s;ual forms of civility oblige no man. There is no more faithful nor plea&s;ant friend than a good book. He who loves to employ him&s;elf well can never want &s;omething to do. A thou&s;and things are well for|got for peace and quietne&s;s &s;ake. A wi&s;e man avoids all occa&s;ions of being angry. A wi&s;e man aims at nothing which is out of his reach. Neither great poverty nor great riches will hear rea&s;on. A good man hath ever good luck. No plea&s;ure is a better penny|worth than that which virtue yields. No old age is agreeable but that of a wi&s;e man. A man's wi&s;dom is no where more &s;een than in his marrying him&s;elf. Folly and anger are but two names for the &s;ame thing. Fortune knocks once at lea&s;t at every one's door. The father's virtue is the be&s;t inheritance a child can have. No &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure ever la&s;ted &s;o much as for a whole hour. Riches and virtue do not often keep one another company. Ruling one's anger well, is not &s;o good as preventing it. The mo&s;t u&s;eful learn|ing is that which teaches us how to die well. The be&s;t men come wor&s;e out of company than they went into it. The mo&s;t mixed or allayed joy is that men take in their children. Find money and marriage to rid your&s;elf of an ill daughter. There is no bet|ter advice than to look always at the i&s;&s;ue of things. Compare your griefs with other men's, and they will &s;eem le&s;s. Owe mo|ney to be paid at Ea&s;ter, and Lent will &s;eem &s;hort to you. He who only returns home, doth not run away. He can do nothing well who is at enmity with his God. Many avoid others, becau&s;e they &s;ee not and know not them&s;elves. God is always opening his hand to us. Let us be friends, and put out the devil's eye. 'Tis true there are many very good wives, but they are under ground. Talking very much, and lying, are cou&s;in-germans. With all your learning be &s;ure to know your&s;elf. One error breeds twenty more. I will never je&s;t with my eye nor with my religion. Do what you have to do ju&s;t now, and leave it not for to-morrow. Ill tongues &s;hould have a pair of &s;ci&s;&s;ors. Huge long hair, and very little brains. Speak little, hear much, and you will &s;eldom be much out. Give me a virtuous woman, and I will make her a fine woman. He who tru&s;ts nobody is never deceived. Drink water like an ox, wine like a king of Spain.

too. He who makes more of you than he u&s;ed to do, either would cheat you or needs you: He that would avoid the &s;in, mu&s;t avoid the occa&s;ion of it. Keep your&s;elf from the anger of a great man, from a tumult of the mob, from fools in a narrow way, from a man that is marked, from a widow that hath been thrice married, from wind that comes in at a hole, and from a reconciled enemy. One ounce of mirth is worth more than ten thou&s;and weight of melancholy. A contented mind is a great gift of God. He that would cheat the devil mu&s;t ri&s;e early in the morning. Every fool is in love with his own bauble. Every ill man will have an ill time. Keep your &s;word between you and the &s;trength of a clown. Be ye la&s;t to go over a deep river. He who hath a hand&s;ome wife, or a ca&s;tle on the frontier, or a vine|yard near the highway, never wants a quarrel. Never deceive your phy&s;ician, your confe&s;&s;or, nor your lawyer. Make a bridge of &s;ilver for a flying enemy. Never tru&s;t him whom you have wronged. Seek for good, and be ready for evil. What you can do alone by your&s;elf, expect not from another. Idlene&s;s in youth makes way for a painful and mi&s;erable old age. He who pretends to be every body's particular friend is nobody's. Con&s;ider well before you tie that knot you never can undo. Neither prai&s;e nor di&s;prai&s;e any before you know them. A prodigal &s;on &s;ucceeds a covetous father. He is fool enough him&s;elf who will bray again&s;t another a&s;s. Though old and wi&s;e, yet &s;till advi&s;e. Happy is he that mends of him&s;elf, without the help of others. A wi&s;e man knows his own ignorance, a fool thinks he knows every thing. What you eat your&s;elf never gains you a friend: Great hou&s;e|keeping makes but a poor will. Fair words and foul deeds de|ceive wi&s;e men as well as fools. Eating too well at fir&s;t makes men eat ill afterwards. Let him &s;peak who received, let the giver hold his peace. A hou&s;e built by a man's father, and a vineyard planted by his grandfather. A dapple-grey hor&s;e will die &s;ooner than tire. No woman is ugly when &s;he is dre&s;&s;ed. The be&s;t re|medy again&s;t an evil man is to keep at a good di&s;tance from him. A man's folly is &s;een by his &s;inging, his playing, and riding full &s;peed. Buying a thing too dear is no bounty. Buy at a fair, and &s;ell at home. Keep aloof from all quarrels, be neither a witne&s;s nor party. God doth us more and more good every hour of our lives. An ill blow, or an ill word, is all you will get from a fool. He who lies long in bed, his e&s;tate pays for it. Con&s;ider well of a bu&s;ine&s;s, and di&s;patch it quickly. He who hath no children, hath neither kindred nor friends. May I have a di&s;pute with a wi&s;e man, if with any. He who hath lo&s;t &s;hame is lo&s;t to all virtue. Being in love brings no reputation to any man, but vexation to all. Giving to the poor le&s;&s;ens no man's &s;tore. He who is idle is al|ways wanting &s;omewhat. Evil comes to us by ells, and goes a|way by inches. He who&s;e hou&s;e is tiled with gla&s;s mu&s;t not throw &s;tones at his neighbours. The man is fire, the woman tow, and the devil comes to blow the coals. He who doth not look for|ward, finds him&s;elf behind other men. The love of God prevails for ever, all other things come to nothing. He who is to give an account of him&s;elf and others, mu&s;t know both him&s;elf and them. A man's love and his faith appear by his works or deeds. In all

contention put a bridle upon your tongue. In a great fro&s;t a nail is worth a hor&s;e. I went a fool to the court, and came back an a&s;s. Keep money when you are young, that you may have it when you are old. Speak but little, and to the purpo&s;e, and you will pa&s;s for &s;omebody. If you do evil, expect to &s;uffer evil. Sell cheap, and you will &s;ell as much as four others. An ill child is better &s;ick than well. He who ri&s;es early in the morning hath &s;omewhat in his head. The gallows will have its own at la&s;t. A lie hath no legs. Women, wind, and fortune, are ever changing. Fools and wilful men make the lawyers great. Never &s;ign a wri|ting till you have read it, nor drink water till you have &s;een it. Neither is any barber dumb, nor any &s;ong&s;ter very wi&s;e. Nei|ther give to all nor contend with fools. Do no ill, and fear no harm. He doth &s;omething who &s;ets his hou&s;e on fire; he &s;cares away the rats and warms him&s;elf. I fell nothing on tru&s;t till to|morrow. [Written over the &s;hop-doors.] The common people pardon no fault in any man. The &s;idler of the &s;ame town never plays well at their fea&s;t. Either rich, or hanged in the attempt. The fea&s;t is over, but here is the fool &s;till. To divide as brothers u&s;e to do: that which is mine is all my own, that which is yours I go halves in. There will be no money got by lo&s;ing your time. He will &s;oon be a lo&s;t man him&s;elf who keeps &s;uch men company. By courte&s;ies done to the meane&s;t men, you get much more than you can lo&s;e. Trouble not your&s;elf about news, it will &s;oon grow &s;tale and you will have it. That which is well &s;aid, is &s;aid &s;oon enough. When the devil goes to his prayers he means to cheat you. When you meet with a fool, pretend bu&s;ine&s;s to get rid of him. Sell him for an a&s;s at a fair, who talks much and knows little. He who buys and &s;ells doth not feel what he &s;pends. He who ploughs his land, and breeds cattle, &s;pins gold. He who will venture nothing mu&s;t never get on hor&s;eback. He who goes far from home for a wife, either means to cheat, or will be cheat|ed. He who &s;ows his land, tru&s;ts in God. He who leaves the great road for a by-path, thinks to &s;ave ground, and he lo&s;es it. He who &s;erves the public obliges nobody. He who keeps his fir&s;t innocency e&s;capes a thou&s;and &s;ins.

have a mind to do well, and to put it off at the pre&s;ent, are much the &s;ame. Italy to be born in, France to live in, and Spain to die in. He lo&s;es the good of his afflictions who is not the better for them. It is the mo&s;t dangerous vice which looks like virtue. It is great wi&s;dom to forget all the injuries we may receive. Pro&s;|perity is the thing in the world we ought to tru&s;t lea&s;t. Experi|ence without learning does more good than learning without ex|perience. Virtue is the be&s;t patrimony for children to inherit. It is much more painful to live ill than to live well. An hearty good-will never wants time to &s;how it&s;elf. To have done well obliges us to do &s;o &s;till. He hath a great opinion of him&s;elf who makes no compari&s;on with others. He only is rich enough who hath all that he de&s;ires. The be&s;t way of in&s;truction is to practi&s;e that which we teach others. It is but a little narrow &s;oul which earthly things can plea&s;e. The rea&s;on why parents love the youn|ger children be&s;t, is becau&s;e they have &s;o little hopes that the el|der will do well. The deare&s;t child of all is that which is dead. He who is about to marry &s;hould con&s;ider how it is with his neigh|bours. There is a much &s;horter cut from virtue to vice, than from vice to virtue. He is the happy man, not whom other men think, but who thinks him&s;elf to be &s;o. Of &s;inful plea&s;ure re|pentance only remains. He who hath much wants &s;till more, and then more. The le&s;s a man &s;leeps the more he lives. He can ne|ver &s;peak well who knows not when to hold his peace. The tru|e&s;t content is that which no man can deprive you of. The remem|brance of wi&s;e and good men in&s;tructs as well as their pre&s;ence. It is wi&s;dom in a doubtful ca&s;e, rather to take another man's judge|ment than our own. Wealth betrays the be&s;t re&s;olved mind into one vice or other. We are u&s;ually the be&s;t men when we are wor&s;t in health. Learning is wealth to the poor, an honour to the rich, and a &s;upport and comfort to old age. Learning procures re&s;pect to good fortune, and helps out the bad. The ma&s;ter makes the hou&s;e to be re&s;pected, not the hou&s;e the ma&s;ter. The &s;hort and &s;ure way to reputation, is to take care to be in truth what we would have others think us to be. A good reputation is a &s;econd, or half an e&s;tate. He is the better man who comes neare&s;t to the be&s;t. A wrong judgment of things is the mo&s;t mi&s;chievous thing in the world. The neglect or contempt of riches makes a man more truly great than the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them. That only is true honour which he gives who de&s;erves it him&s;elf. Beauty and cha|&s;tity have always a mortal quarrel between them. Look always upon life, and u&s;e it as a thing that is lent you. Civil offers are for all men, and good offers for our friends. Nothing in the world is &s;tronger than a man but his own pa&s;&s;ions. When a man comes into troubles, money is one of his be&s;t friends. He only is the great learned man who knows enough to make him live well An empty pur&s;e with a new hou&s;e fini&s;hed makes a man want money &s;omewhat too late.</P>

<P>In every work begin and end with God. The grace of God is worth a fair. He is a fool who cannot be angry; but he is a wi&s;e man who will not.

He who peri&s;hes in a needle&s;s danger, is the devil's martyr. Better &s;pare at the brim, than at the bottom. He who &s;erves God is the true wi&s;e man. The ha&s;ty man never wants woe. There is a God in the almonry. He who will thrive mu&s;t ri&s;e at five. He who has thriven may &s;leep till &s;even. Prayer brings down the fir&s;t ble&s;&s;ing, and prai&s;e the &s;econd.

A good word is as &s;oon &s;aid as a bad one. Little &s;aid &s;oon amended. Fair words butter no par&s;nips. That penny is well &s;pent that &s;aves four time its value to its ma&s;ter. Penny in pocket is a good companion. For all your kindred make much of your friends. He who hath money in his pur&s;e, cannot want a head for his &s;houlders.

Too much taking heed is &s;ometimes lo&s;s. 'Tis ea&s;ier to build two chimnies than to maintain one. He hath no lei&s;ure who u&s;eth it not. The wife is the key of the hou&s;e. The life of a man is a winter way, The lea&s;t fooli&s;h is counted wi&s;e. Life is half &s;pent before we know what it is to live. Wine is a turn-coat; fir&s;t a friend, then an enemy.

<P>Time undermines us all. Conver&s;ation makes a man what he is. The dainties of the great are the tears of the poor. The great put the little on the hook. Lawyers hou&s;es are built on the heads of fools. Among good men two &s;uffice. The be&s;t bred have the be&s;t portion. To live peaceably with all breeds good blood. He who hath the charge of &s;ouls tran&s;ports them not in bundles. Pains to get, care to keep, fear to lo&s;e. When a lackey comes to hell, the devil locks the gates. He that tells his wife news is but newly married. He who will make a door of gold, mu&s;t knock in a nail every day. If the brain &s;ows not corn, it plants tru&s;ties. A woman conceals what &s;he knows not. Some evils are cured by contempt. God deals his wrath by weight, but without weight his mercy. Follow not truth too near at the heels, le&s;t it da&s;h out your teeth. Say to plea&s;ure, gentle Eve, I will have none of your apple. Marry your daughters betimes, le&s;t they marry them&s;elves. Every man's cen&s;ure is u&s;ually fir&s;t moulded in his own nature. Su&s;picion is the virtue of a coward. Stay a while, that we may make an end the &s;ooner.

Sir John Barley|Corn is the &s;tronge&s;t knight. Every a&s;s thinks him&s;elf worthy to &s;tand with the king's hor&s;es. A good beginning makes a good ending.

To forget a wrong is the be&s;t revenge. Manners make the man. Man doth what he can, God doth what he plea&s;es. Gold goes in at any gate except that of heaven. Knaves and fools divide the world. No great lo&s;s but may bring &s;ome little profit. When poverty comes in at the door, love leaps out at the window. That &s;uit is be&s;t that be&s;t fits me. Self-love is a mote in every man's eye. That which is well done is twice done. U&s;e &s;oft words and hard arguments. There is no coward to an ill con&s;cience. He who makes other men afraid of his wit, had need be afraid of their memories. Riches are but the baggage of virtue. He who defers his charities till his death, is rather libe|ral of anothers man's than of his own. A wi&s;e man hath more balla&s;t than &s;ail. Great men's promi&s;es, courtier's oaths, and dead men's &s;hoes, a man may look for, but not tru&s;t to. Be wi&s;e on this &s;ide of heaven. The devil tempts others, an idle man tempts the devil. Good looks buy nothing in the market. He who will be his own ma&s;ter often hath a fool for his &s;cholar. That man is well bought who co&s;ts you but a compliment. The great|e&s;t king mu&s;t at la&s;t go to bed with a &s;hovel or &s;pade. He only truly lives who lives in peace. If wi&s;e men never erred, it would go hard with the fool. Great virtue &s;eldom de&s;cends. One wi&s;e (in marriage) and two happy. Alms giving never made any man poor, nor robbery rich, nor pro&s;perity wi&s;e. A fool and his money are &s;oon parted.

Ever drink, ever dry. He who hath an ill name is half hanged. Harm watch, harm catch. A friend's frown is better than a fool's &s;mile. The ea&s;ie&s;t work and way is, To beware. If the be&s;t man's faults were written in his forehead, it would make him pull his hat over his eyes. A man may be great by chance; but never wi&s;e, or good, without taking pains for it. Succe&s;s makes a fool &s;eem wi&s;e. All worldly joys go le&s;s, to that one joy of doing kind|ne&s;&s;es. What fools &s;ay doth not much trouble wi&s;e men. Money is a good &s;ervant, but an ill ma&s;ter. Plea&s;ure gives law to fools, God to the wi&s;e. He lives indeed who lives not to him&s;elf alone. Good to begin well, better to end well. There would be no ill language if it were not ill taken. Indu&s;try is fortune's right-hand, and frugality is her left. We &s;hall lie all alike in our graves. When flatterers meet, the devil goes to dinner. It is a &s;mall fa|mily that hath neither a thief nor a harlot in it. To give and to keep there is need of wit. A man never &s;urfeits of too much hone&s;ty. Honour and ea&s;e are &s;eldom bed-fellows. Tho&s;e hu&s;|bands are in heaven who&s;e wives do not chide. He can want nothing who hath God for his friend. Young men's knocks old men feel. He who is poor when he is married, &s;hall be rich when he is buried. Of all tame bea&s;ts, I hate &s;luts. Giving much to the poor, doth increa&s;e a man's &s;tore. That is my good that doth me good. An idle brain is the devil's &s;hop. God &s;end us &s;omewhat of our own, when rich men go to dinner.</P>

<HEAD>A FABLE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By the Celebrated LINNOEUS, Tran&s;lated from the Latin.</BYLINE>
<P>ONCE upon a time the &s;even wi&s;e men of Greece were met together at Athens, and it was propo&s;ed that every one of them &s;hould mention what he thought the greate&s;t wonder in the crea|tion. One of them, of higher conceptions than the re&s;t, propo|&s;ed the opinion of &s;ome of the a&s;tronomers about the fixed &s;tars, which they believed to be &s;o many &s;uns, that had each their pla|nets rolling about them, and were &s;tored with plants and animals like this earth. Fired with this thought, they agreed to &s;uppli|cate Jupiter, that he would at lea&s;t permit them to take a journey to the moon, and &s;tay there three days, in order to &s;ee the wonders of that place, and give an account of them at their return. Ju|piter con&s;ented, and ordered them to a&s;&s;emble on a high mountain, where there &s;hould be a cloud ready to convey them to the place they de&s;ired to &s;ee. They picked out &s;ome cho&s;en companions, who might a&s;&s;i&s;t them in de&s;cribing and painting the objects they
<PB N="220" REF="027039_0222_0FD2FBB0A63B1818">
&s;hould meet with. At length they arrived at the moon, and found a palace there well fitted up for their reception. The next day, being very much fatigued with their journey, they kept quiet at home till noon; and being &s;till faint, they refre&s;hed them|&s;elves with a mo&s;t delicious entertainment, which they reli&s;hed &s;o well, that it overcame their curio&s;ity. This day they only &s;aw through the window that delightful &s;pot, adorned with the mo&s;t beautiful flowers, to which the beams of the &s;un gave an uncom|mon lu&s;tre, and heard the &s;inging of mo&s;t melodious birds till evening came on. The next day they aro&s;e very early in order to begin their ob&s;ervations; but &s;ome very beautiful young ladies of that country coming to make them a vi&s;it, advi&s;ed them fir&s;t to recruit their &s;trength before they expo&s;ed them&s;elves to the labo|rious ta&s;k they were about to undertake.</P>
<P>The delicate meats, the rich wines, the beauty of the&s;e dam&s;els, prevailed over the re&s;olution of the&s;e &s;trangers. A fine concert of mu&s;ic is introduced, the young ones begin to dance, and all is turned to jollity; &s;o that this whole day was &s;pent in gallantry, till &s;ome of the neighbouring inhabitants, growing envious at their mirth, ru&s;hed in with &s;words. The elder part of the company tried to appea&s;e the younger, promi&s;ing the very next day they would bring the rioters to ju&s;tice. This they performed, and the third day the cau&s;e was heard; and what with accu&s;ations, pleadings, exceptions, and the judgment it&s;elf, the whole day was taken up, on which the term &s;et by Jupiter, expired. On their return to Greece, all the country flocked in upon them to hear the wonders of the moon de&s;cribed, but all they could tell was, for that was all they knew, that the ground was covered with green, intermixed with flowers, and that the birds &s;ung among the branches of the trees; but what kind of flowers they &s;aw, or what kind of birds they heard, they were totally ignorant. Upon which they were treated every where with contempt.</P>
<P>If we apply this fable to men of the pre&s;ent age, we &s;hall per|ceive a very ju&s;t &s;imilitude. By the&s;e three days the fable denotes the three ages of man. Fir&s;t, Youth, in which we are too feeble in every re&s;pect to look into the works of the Creator: all that &s;ea&s;on is given up to idlene&s;s, luxury, and pa&s;time. Secondly, Manhood, in which men are employed in &s;ettling, marrying, edu|cating children, providing fortunes for them, and rai&s;ing a family. Thirdly, Old Age, in which after having made their fortunes, they are overwhelmed with law-&s;uits and proceedings relating to their e&s;tates. Thus it frequently happens that men never con&s;ider to to what end they were de&s;tined, and why they were brought into the world.</P>
