<Q>&mdash;Then &s;aith he unto them, Render therefore unto Cae&s;ar, the things that are Cae&s;ars: and unto God, the things that are Gods.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Phari&s;ees, who, in appearance, were the &s;tricte&s;t religious &s;ect among the Jews, ob&s;erving the growing reputation of the Son of God, and finding that he had eclip&s;ed their glory, took coun&s;el how they might entan|gle him in his talk. A conduct this that is re|pugnant to every principle of genuine religion. But tho&s;e men who are determined upon their own aggrandizement, are &s;eldom &s;crupulous about the means of obtaining it. Hence the&s;e ambi|tious religioni&s;ts &s;ent out to him their di&s;ciples, with the Herodians, men &s;it for their purpo&s;e, <HI>&s;aying,</HI> in the language of hypocri&s;y and in&s;ult, <HI>Ma&s;ter, we know that thou art true, and teache&s;t</HI>

<HI>the way of God in truth&punc; neither care&s;t thou for any man: for thou regarde&s;t not the per&s;on of men Tell us therefore, what thinke&s;t thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Cae&s;ar, or not?</HI></P>
<P>THE Jews entertained an extreme aver&s;ion to the Gentiles, and could not be brought to &s;ub|mit to a heathen magi&s;trate but with great reluc|tance, and through ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>THESE Phari&s;ees therefore, judging of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord by their own &s;entiments and feel|ings &s;uppo&s;ed that by this que&s;tion, they &s;hould extort &s;omething from him derogatory to Cae&s;ar's honor; or that would &s;ubject him to an im|peachment as an enemy to the Roman govern|ment. But he taketh the wi&s;e in their own craftine&s;s&mdash;<HI>Shew me,</HI> &s;aid he <HI>the tribute money. And they brought him a penny. And he &s;aith unto them, who&s;e is this image and &s;uper&s;cription? They &s;ay unto him Cae&s;ars. Then &s;aith he unto them. Render therefore unto Cae&s;ar, the things that are Cae&s;ars: and unto God&punc; the things that are Gods.</HI>&mdash;Upon their being thus defeated in their infamous attempt, they marvelled, and went their way to report to their ma&s;ters their humiliating di&s;appointment: for Chri&s;t had &s;aid nothing in his reply to them, which Cae&s;ar him&s;elf would not approve.</P>
<P>IT is a matter of very little con&s;equence to us on this occa&s;ion, which of the Cae&s;ars was on the throne at the time referred to in the text; becau&s;e
<PB N="7" REF="016537_0006_0F9C8E1C650850F0">
the duties here inculcated are not affected by this circum&s;tance. The people were taught by Chri&s;t to render &s;uch obedience to Cae&s;ar, or to the civil magi&s;trate, as would be con&s;i&s;tent with the natu|ral and the civil rights of men, and the obliga|tions they were under to the eternal God. It is unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that he meant to incul|cate any other &s;ubjection than this. Be&s;ides, his addre&s;s is properly guarded "Render there|fore to Cae&s;ar, <HI>the things that are Cae&s;ars."</HI> That is, tho&s;e things which he may lawfully claim. What the&s;e were our Lord does not a&s;certain. Nor is it nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould, as they relate to Cae&s;ar and his &s;ubjects. I &s;hall therefore pro|ceed to apply this &s;acred pa&s;&s;age to our&s;elves in our pre&s;ent &s;ituation, by con&s;idering,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. WHAT tho&s;e duties are which the people owe to the civil magi&s;trate.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. THE duties of the magi&s;trate to the people. And then,</ITEM>

</LIST></P>
<P>I. WE are fir&s;t to enquire what tho&s;e duties are which the people owe to the civil magi&s;trate?</P>
<P>I apprehend that this que&s;tion implies another, which is previou&s;ly nece&s;&s;ary to be determined, viz. How came the men whom we call ma|gi&s;trates, with any power at all over the people?
<PB N="8" REF="016537_0007_0F9C8E1D2263AE30">
Were they born to govern? Have they an higher original than other men? Or, do they claim the &s;overeignty <HI>jure divino?</HI></P>
<P>THE time has been when the divine right of kings &s;ounded from the pulpit and the pre&s;s; and when the &s;acred name of religion was brought in, to &s;anctify the mo&s;t horrid &s;y&s;tems of de&s;poti&s;m and cruelty.&mdash;But ble&s;&s;ed be God, we live in a more happy <HI>aera,</HI> in which the great principles of liberty are better under&s;tood. With us it is a <HI>fir&s;t</HI> and a <HI>fundamental</HI> principle, <HI>that God made all men equal.</HI></P>
<P>"NOTHING is more evident, &s;ays a great writer, than that creatures of the &s;ame &s;pecies and rank, promi&s;cuou&s;ly born to all the &s;ame ad|vantages of nature, and the u&s;e of the &s;ame facul|ties, &s;hould al&s;o be equal one among&s;t another without &s;ubordination or &s;ubjection, unle&s;s the Lord and ma&s;ter of them all &s;hould, by any manife&s;t declaration of his will, &s;et one above another, and confer on him, by an evident and clear appointment, an undoubted right to domi|nion and &s;overeignty."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Locke.</NOTE></P>
<P>UNTIL &s;uch a declaration of the divine will &s;hall be produced, we ought firmly to maintain the <HI>natural equality</HI> of all men.</P>
<P>AND as they are <HI>equal,</HI> &s;o they are likewi&s;e in a &s;tate of <HI>entire freedom.</HI> Whatever they po&s;&s;e&s;s is their own; to be di&s;po&s;ed of &s;olely agreeable
<PB N="9" REF="016537_0008_0F9C8E1DE4D02DD8">
to their own will. None have a right to claim any part of their property, to di&s;turb them in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, or to demand &s;ubjection in any degree whatever, while they act con&s;i&s;tent with the law of nature. He who attempts to do either, is an u&s;urper, puts him&s;elf into a &s;tate of war, and may be oppo&s;ed as a common high|wayman.</P>
<P>IF we admit the truth of the&s;e principles, we come by an ea&s;y tran&s;ition to the foundation of civil &s;ociety, viz. <HI>The con&s;ent of the people.</HI> For if all men are equal by nature, it mu&s;t depend entirely upon them&s;elves, whether they will con|tinue in their natural condition, or exchange it for a &s;tate of civil government. Con&s;equently the &s;overeignty re&s;ides originally in the people.</P>
<P>As their leaving a &s;tate of nature for a &s;tate of civil &s;ociety, is a matter of their own choice, &s;o they are equally free to adopt that form of go|vernment which appears to them the mo&s;t eligi|ble, or the be&s;t calculated to promote the hap|pine&s;s of them&s;elves and of their po&s;terity.</P>
<P>WHICH is the be&s;t form of civil government? is a que&s;tion of the fir&s;t magnitude to any people; and particularly to us, who have lately con&s;idered this weighty matter; and who expect, at &s;ome future period, finally to determine it.&mdash;May that God by whom all human events are controled, in&s;pire my fellow-citizens with that wi&s;dom that &s;hall be profitable to direct!</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="016537_0009_0F9C8E1EA718C230">
FROM the premi&s;es, the following is a natural conclu&s;ion&mdash;<HI>That the authority of the civil ma|gi&s;trate is, under God, derived from the people.</HI></P>
<P>IN order therefore to determine with accuracy, what the powers of the civil magi&s;trate are, and al&s;o the duties that the people owe him, we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to the con&s;titution; by which, in all good governments, the authority of the for|mer, and the rights of the latter are determined with preci&s;ion.</P>
<P>THAT it &s;hould be &s;o, is a dictate of common &s;en&s;e. For upon a &s;uppo&s;ition of the contrary, how &s;hall rulers or &s;ubjects determine their re|&s;pective obligations?</P>
<P>FROM hence ari&s;es, in my view, the indi&s;pen|&s;able nece&s;&s;ity of a BILL OF RIGHTS, drawn up in the mo&s;t explicit language, previou&s;ly to the ratification of a con&s;titution of government; which &s;hould contain its fundamental principles, and which no per&s;on in the &s;tate, however dig|nified, &s;hould dare to violate but at his peril.</P>
<P>As we are at pre&s;ent without a fixed form of government, I &s;hall treat the &s;ubject rather ac|cording to my wi&s;hes, than the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things. For the con&s;titution ought at lea&s;t to have a general exi&s;tence in idea, before the reci|procal duties of magi&s;trates and people can be a&s;certained.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="016537_0010_0F9C8E1F657C2548">
SOME of tho&s;e principles which, I apprehend, may be called <HI>fundamental,</HI> have been mentioned; to which I beg leave to &s;ubjoin,</P>
<P>THAT the great end for which men enter in|to a &s;tate of civil &s;ociety, is <HI>their own advantage.</HI></P>
<P>That civil rulers, as they derive their authority from the people, &s;o they are accountable to them for the u&s;e they make of it&mdash;</P>
<P>That elections ought to be <HI>free</HI> and <HI>frequent</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>That repre&s;entation &s;hould be as equal as po&s;&s;ible&mdash;</P>
<P>That as all men are equal by nature, &s;o when they enter into a &s;tate of civil government, they are entitled <HI>preci&s;ely</HI> to the &s;ame rights and privileges; or to an <HI>equal degree</HI> of political happine&s;s&mdash;</P>
<P>That &s;ome of the natural rights of mankind are unalienable, and &s;ubject to no control but that of the Deity. Such are the SACRED RIGHTS of CONSCIENCE. Which in a &s;tate of nature, and of civil &s;ociety are exactly the &s;ame. They can neither be parted with nor controled, by any human authority whatever.</P>
<P>Attempts of this kind have been repeatedly made by an ambitious clergy, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by rulers of de&s;potic principles. The con&s;equence of which has been, that crowds of the be&s;t members of &s;ociety have been reduced to this dreadful alter|native, either to offend God and violate the dic|tates of their own minds, or to die at a &s;take.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="016537_0011_0F9C8E2023A33AE0">
That the right of trial by jury ought to be perpetual&mdash;</P>
<P>That no man's property can, of right, be taken from him without his con&s;ent, given either in per&s;on, or by his repre&s;entative&mdash;</P>
<P>That no laws are obligatory on the people, but tho&s;e that have obtained a like con&s;ent. Nor are &s;uch laws of any force, if, proceeding from a corrupt majority of the legi&s;lature, they are incompatible with the fundamental princi|ples of the government, and tend to &s;ubvert it.</P>
<P>"ALL human things have an end, &s;ays a &s;en|&s;ible writer, the &s;tate we are &s;peaking of (meaning Great-Britain) will lo&s;e its liberty, will peri&s;h.

<P>LET us ca&s;t our eye to the land of our fa|thers, to the kingdom from whence we de&s;cend|ed, and we &s;hall find that &s;he now totters on the brink of a mo&s;t dangerous precipice. And that &s;he hath been brought into her pre&s;ent de|plorable &s;ituation by a <HI>venal majority.</HI></P>
<P>SOME of that people fore&s;aw their cata&s;trophe approaching with ha&s;ty &s;trides; they petitioned and remon&s;trated. And &s;everal excellent things were publi&s;hed in vindication of their con&s;titu|tion and their injured rights: but all was in vain.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="016537_0012_0F9C8E20EE8940F8">
THE very men who were appointed the guar|dians and <HI>con&s;ervator,</HI> of the rights of the people, have di&s;membred the Empire; and by repeated acts of inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion, have forced from the bo&s;om of their parent country, millions of Americans, who might have been drawn by a <HI>hair,</HI> but were not to be driven by all the <HI>thunder</HI> of Britain.</P>
<P>A few &s;oft words would have fixed them in her intere&s;t, and have turned away that wrath which her cruel conduct had inkindled. The &s;amene&s;s of religion, of language and of man|ners, together with intere&s;t, that powerful motive, and a recollection of that reciprocation of kind offices which had long prevailed, would have held America in clo&s;e&s;t friend&s;hip with Great-Britain, had &s;he not "governed too much."</P>
<P>IT can afford the inhabitants of that once happy country, no con&s;olation in their pre&s;ent threatning condition, that it hath been brought on with all the <HI>formality of law.</HI> Rather this circum&s;tance adds to the calamity, &s;eeing the men who &s;hould have &s;aved them, have betrayed them.</P>
<P>WHERE is now the boa&s;ted freedom of the Briti&s;h government? Bribery and corruption, &s;eem nearly to have accompli&s;hed the prediction of the great Monte&s;quieu. Nor is &s;uch an event to be wondred at, while we reflect on

SUCH an in&s;tance affords us many important le&s;&s;ons; and calls upon us to guard as much as po&s;&s;ible, in <HI>our beginning,</HI> again&s;t the corruption of human nature. We &s;hould leave nothing to human virtue, that can be provided for by law or the con&s;titution. The more we tru&s;t in the hands of any man, the more we try his virtue, which, at &s;ome fatal hour, may yield to a temptation; and the people di&s;cover their error, when it is too late to prevent the mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>UPON the truth of the principles advanced, I ob&s;erve, That the authority of the magi&s;trate is derived from the people by con&s;ent&mdash;that it is limited and &s;ubordinate&mdash;and that &s;o long as he exerci&s;es the power with which he is ve&s;ted, according to the original compact, the people owe him <HI>reverence, obedience</HI> and <HI>&s;upport.</HI></P>
<P>INSPIRATION teaches us to <HI>give honor to whom honor, fear to whom fear.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN any men are taken from the common rank of citizens, and are entru&s;ted with the powers of government, they are by that act ennobled. Their election implies their per&s;onal merit, and is a public declaration of it. For it is taken for granted, that the people have been influenced in their choice by worthine&s;s of cha|racter, and not by family-connections, or other ba&s;e motives. They are therefore intitled to a
<PB N="16" REF="016537_0015_0F9C8E23281D4D68">
certain degree of re&s;pect from their con&s;tituents&punc; who, while they pay them due reverence, will feel it reflected upon them&s;elves, becau&s;e they bear their commi&s;&s;ion. Both intere&s;t and duty oblige them to reverence the powers that be. It is their duty in con&s;equence of their own appointment. And their intere&s;t, be|cau&s;e the good of the community depends much upon it. For as far as any of the citizens unju&s;tly depreciate the merit of rulers, &s;o far they le&s;&s;en the energy of government, and put it out of their power to promote the public good.</P>
<P>WITH reverence to the per&s;on of the magi|&s;trate, we connect <HI>obedience to his authority:</HI> Such obedience as is compatible with the prin|ciples already laid down. The term <HI>government</HI> implies this <HI>&s;ubordination,</HI> which is e&s;&s;ential to its very exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>WHEN therefore any per&s;ons ri&s;e in oppo&s;i|tion to &s;uch authority, they are guilty of a mo&s;t daring offence again&s;t the State; becau&s;e&punc; as far as it prevails, it tends to de&s;troy the &s;ocial com|pact, and to introduce confu&s;ion and every evil work. Con&s;equently,</P>
<P>IT is the duty of the people to <HI>&s;upport the magi&s;trate, in the due execution of the laws, again&s;t &s;uch,</HI> and <HI>all other offenders.</HI> To chu&s;e men to office, and not to &s;upport them in the execution of it, is too great an ab&s;urdity, one would think, to find any abettors.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="016537_0016_0F9C8E23E5E0BB48">
THERE is al&s;o a <HI>pecuniary &s;upport</HI> which the magi&s;trate hath a right to receive from his con|&s;tituents. It is mo&s;t rea&s;onable that tho&s;e per|&s;ons who&s;e time and abilities are devoted to the &s;ervice of their country, &s;hould be amply pro|vided for while they are thus engaged. The compen&s;ation &s;hould be adequate to the &s;ervices they render the State. Let it be &s;ufficient, but not redundant.</P>
<P>WHILE &s;peaking of that &s;upport which the &s;ervants of government are entitled to, I beg leave to mention tho&s;e brave men of every rank, who compo&s;e our army. They have &s;tepped forth in the hour of danger, have exchanged dome&s;tic ca&s;e and happine&s;s for the hard&s;hips of the camp,&mdash;have repeatedly fought; and many of them have bled in the cau&s;e of their country. Of their importance no man can be ignorant.</P>
<P>WITH deference to this venerable a&s;&s;embly, I am con&s;trained to ob&s;erve. That our fir&s;t at|tention is due to them; becau&s;e, under God, they have been, now are, and we tru&s;t will be our defence.

As a free government is founded in compact, the parties concerned in it are con&s;equently laid under mutual obligations. The&s;e, it hath been &s;aid, are determined by the con&s;titution. If &s;o, it follows, that the rulers of the people ought to make them&s;elves thoroughly acquainted with it, together with the different laws of the State. Therefore, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hould be men of lei&s;ure and abilities, whether they are called to act in a le|gi&s;lative, or executive department.</P>
<P>IT is taken for granted, that the rulers of the people will not forget the &s;ource of their power, nor the de&s;ign of their appointment to office&mdash;that they have no authority but what they derived from the people; who, from a con|fidence in them, that reflects great honor on them, have put it into their hands, with this &s;ole view,&mdash;That they might thereby promote the good of the community.</P>
<P>WHETHER this great end is accompli&s;hed by the exerci&s;e of the authority of civil ru|lers, the people are to judge; with whom the powers of government originate, and who mu&s;t know the end for which they entru&s;ted them in the hands of any of their fellow-citizens.

<P>A SPIRIT of ambition, which is natural to man, tends to tyranny; and an undue attach|ment to per&s;onal intere&s;t, may i&s;&s;ue in fraud; or in an accumulation of offices, which in their own nature are incompatible with each other; and which no man, let his abilities be what they may, can di&s;charge with honor to him&s;elf, and advantage to his country.</P>
<P>A FAITHFUL ruler will con&s;ider him&s;elf as a tru&s;tee of the public, and that he is accountable both to God and to the people for his behaviour in his office. He will therefore be very careful not to involve him&s;elf in more public bu&s;ine&s;s, than he can perform with fidelity.</P>
<P>IT would have a happy tendency to render the duty of the magi&s;trate ea&s;y and &s;ucce&s;sful, were he to cultivate an intimate acquaintance, with the genius and tempers of the people over whom he pre&s;ides. By &s;uch an acqui&s;ition, if prudent, he would be capable of pur&s;uing a mode of conduct, that would not fail of gaining him the affections and confidence of his &s;ubjects. The importance of which is &s;elf-evident.</P>

<P>III. To attempt to draw the line between the things that belong to Cae&s;ar, and tho&s;e things that belong to God.</P>
<P>To this enquiry I am naturally led by the text. <HI>Render therefore to Cae&s;ar the things that are Cae&s;ar's: and unto God the things that are God's.</HI> It is mo&s;t evident in this pa&s;&s;age, that there are &s;ome things which Cae&s;ar, or the ma|gi&s;trate, cannot of right demand, nor the peo|ple yield.

the perpetual enjoyment of civil and religious liberty, in their fulle&s;t extent.</P>
<P>IT becomes us therefore to &s;ettle this mo&s;t weighty matter in our different forms of govern|ment, in &s;uch a manner, that no occa&s;ion may be left in future, for the violation of the all-im|portant rights of con&s;cience.</P>

If this be not done, there can be no end put to the contro|ver&s;ies that will be always ari&s;ing between tho&s;e that have, or at lea&s;t pretend to have, on the one &s;ide, a concernment for the intere&s;t of men's &s;ouls, and on the other &s;ide, a care of the com|mon wealth.</P>

<P>NOW that the whole juri&s;diction of the ma|gi&s;trate reaches only to the&s;e civil concernments, and that all civil power, right and dominion, is
<PB N="23" REF="016537_0022_0F9C8E2863069D20">
bounded and confined to the only care of pro|moting the&s;e things; and that it neither can nor ought in any manner to be extended to the &s;al|vation of &s;ouls, the&s;e following con&s;iderations &s;eem to me abundantly to demon&s;trate,</P>
<P>FIRST, Becau&s;e the care of &s;ouls is not com|mitted to the civil magi&s;trate any more than to other men. It is not committed to him, I &s;ay, by God; becau&s;e it appears not that God has ever given any &s;uch authority to one man over ano|ther, as to compel any one to his religion. Nor can any &s;uch power be ve&s;ted in the magi&s;trate by the <HI>con&s;ent of the people;</HI> becau&s;e no man can &s;o far abandon the care of his own &s;alva|tion, as blindly to leave it to the choice of any other, whether prince or &s;ubject, to pre&s;cribe to him what faith or wor&s;hip he &s;hall embrace. For no man can, if he would, conform his faith to the dictates of another. All the life and power of true religion con&s;i&s;ts in the inward and full per&s;ua&s;ion of the mind; and faith is not faith without believing.&mdash;</P>
<P>IN <HI>the &s;econd place,</HI> The care of &s;ouls cannot belong to the civil magi&s;trate, becau&s;e his power con&s;i&s;ts only in outward force; but true and &s;aving religion con&s;i&s;ts in the inward per&s;ua&s;ion of the mind, without which nothing can be ac|ceptable to God. And &s;uch is the nature of the under&s;tanding, that it cannot be compelled to any thing by outward force.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="016537_0023_0F9C8E29239A8468">
IN <HI>the third place,</HI> The care of the &s;alvation of men's &s;ouls cannot belong to the civil magi&s;|trate; becau&s;e, though the rigour of laws and the force of penalties were capable to convince and change men's minds, yet would not that help at all to the &s;alvation of their &s;ouls. For, there being but one truth, one way to Heaven; what hope is there that more men would be led into it, if they had no other rule to follow but the religion of the court, and were put under the nece&s;&s;ity to quit the light of their own rea&s;on, to oppo&s;e the dictates of their own con&s;ciences, and blindly re&s;ign up them&s;elves to the will of their governors, and to the religion which either ignorance, ambition or &s;uper&s;tition had chanced to e&s;tabli&s;h in the countries where they were born? In the variety and contradiction of opinions in religion, wherein the princes of the world are as much divided as in their &s;ecular intere&s;ts, the narrow way would be much &s;traitened; one country alone would be in the right, and all the re&s;t of the world put under an obligation of fol|lowing their princes in the ways that lead to de&s;truction: And what heightens the ab&s;urdity, and very ill &s;uits the notion of a Deity, men would owe their eternal happine&s;s or mi&s;ery to the places of their nativity.</P>
<P>THESE con&s;iderations, to omit many others that might have been urged to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, &s;eem to me &s;ufficient to conclude that all the power of civil government relates only to men's civil intere&s;ts, is confined to the care of the

things of this world, and hath nothing to do with the world to come.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Locks on Toleration, p. 35, 36, 37.</NOTE></P></Q>
<P>THESE &s;entiments, I humbly conceive, do honor to their author, and di&s;cover a true great|ne&s;s and liberality of mind; and are calculated properly to limit the power of civil rulers, and to &s;ecure to every man the ine&s;timable right of private judgment.</P>
<P>THEY are al&s;o perfectly agreeable to a fundamental principle of government, which we univer&s;ally admit. We &s;ay, <HI>That the power of the civil magi&s;trate is derived from the people.</HI> If &s;o, it follows that he can neither have <HI>more,</HI> nor <HI>any other kind of power</HI> than they had to give.</P>
<P>THE power which the people commit into the hands of the magi&s;trate, is wholly confined to the things of this world. Other power than this they have not. They have not the lea&s;t authority over the con&s;ciences of one another, nor over their own con&s;ciences &s;o as to alienate them, or &s;ubject them to the controul of the ci|vil magi&s;trate in matters of religion, in which every man is <HI>per&s;onally</HI> intere&s;ted; and concern|ing which every man ought to be fully per&s;uad|ed in his own mind, and to follow it's dictates at all hazards, becau&s;e he is to <HI>account for him|&s;elf</HI> at the judgment &s;eat of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="016537_0025_0F9C8E2AA763B5B0">
SEEING then that the people have no power that they can commit into the hands of the magi&s;trate, but that which relates to the good of civil &s;ociety, it follows that the magi&s;trate can have no other, becau&s;e he derives his authority from the people. Such as the power of the peo|ple is, &s;uch mu&s;t be the power of the magi&s;trate.</P>
<P>To the&s;e ob&s;ervations I beg leave to add, that <HI>the kingdom of Chri&s;t is not of this world.</HI> By his kingdom we mean his church, which is alto|gether &s;piritual. Its origin, government and pre|&s;ervation are entirely of him, who hath upon his ve&s;ture and upon his thigh written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.</P>
<P>THE doctrines that we are to believe, the duties that we are to perform, the officers who are to &s;erve in this kingdom, and the laws by which all its &s;ubjects are to be governed, we become acquainted with by the oracles of God, which are the chri&s;tians infallible directory: To which he is bound to yield obedience, at the ri&s;que of his reputation and life.</P>
<P>THEY who enter into this kingdom do it vo|luntarily, with a de&s;ign of promoting their &s;pi|ritual intere&s;ts. Civil affairs they re&s;ign to the care of the magi&s;trate, but the &s;alva|tion of their &s;ouls they &s;eek in the kingdom of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="016537_0026_0F9C8E2B62341698">
THIS kingdom does not in any re&s;pects inter|fere with civil government; rather tends to pro|mote its peace and happine&s;s, becau&s;e its &s;ubjects are taught to obey magi&s;tracy, and to <HI>lead peace|able and quiet lives in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty.</HI></P>
<P>THE &s;ubjects of the kingdom of Chri&s;t, claim no exemption from the ju&s;t authority of the magi&s;trate, by virtue of their relation to it. Rather they yield a ready and chearful obedience, not <HI>only for wrath, but al&s;o for con&s;cience &s;ake.</HI> And &s;hould any of them violate the laws of the &s;tate, they are to be puni&s;hed as other men.</P>
<P>THEY exerci&s;e no <HI>&s;ecular</HI> power, they inflict no <HI>temporal</HI> penalties upon the per&s;ons of one another. All their puni&s;hments are <HI>&s;piritual.</HI> Their <HI>weapons are not carnal, but mighty through God.</HI> They u&s;e no other force than that of rea&s;on and argument to reclaim delinquents; nor are &s;uch per&s;ons to be puni&s;hed for continuing incorrigible, in any other way than by rebuke, or exclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>THEY pretend not to exerci&s;e their &s;piritual authority over any per&s;ons, who have not joined them&s;elves to them of their own accord. <HI>What have I to do,</HI> &s;ays Paul, <HI>to judge them al&s;o who are without? do ye not judge them who are within?</HI></P>
<P>THE &s;ubjects of this kingdom are bound by no laws in matters of religion, but &s;uch as they
<PB N="28" REF="016537_0027_0F9C8E2C2566C4A0">
receive from Chri&s;t, who is the only lawgiver and head of his church. All human laws in this re&s;pect are inadmi&s;&s;ible, as being unnece&s;&s;ary, and as implying a gro&s;s reflection on our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as though he was either unable, or unwilling to provide for his own intere&s;t in the world. Nor will he &s;tand by an idle &s;pectator, of the many encroachments that have been made on his &s;acred prerogative, by the powers of the world.</P>
<P>SHOULD the mo&s;t dignified civil ruler become a member of his church, or a &s;ubject of his &s;piritual kingdom, he cannot carry the lea&s;t de|gree of his <HI>civil</HI> power into it. In the church he is as any other member of it, entitled to the &s;ame &s;piritual privileges, and bound by the &s;ame laws. The authority he has derived from the &s;tate, can by no means be extended to the king|dom of Chri&s;t, becau&s;e Chri&s;t is the only &s;ource of that power, that is to be exerci&s;ed in it.</P>
<P>IT may be &s;aid, That religion is of importance to the good of civil &s;ociety, therefore the magi|&s;trate ought to encourage it under this idea.</P>
<P>IT is readily acknowledged, that the intrin&s;ic excellence and beneficial effects of true religion are &s;uch, that <HI>every man</HI> who is favored with the chri&s;tian revelation, ought to befriend it. It has the <HI>promi&s;e of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</HI> And there are many ways in which the civil magi&s;trate may encourage religion,
<PB N="29" REF="016537_0028_0F9C8E2CE223F998">
in a perfect agreement with the nature of the kingdom of Chri&s;t, and the rights of con&s;cience.</P>
<P>As a <HI>man</HI> he is <HI>per&s;onally</HI> intere&s;ted in it. His everla&s;ting &s;alvation is at &s;take. Therefore he &s;hould &s;earch the &s;criptures for him&s;elf, and fol|low them wherever they lead him. This right he hath in common with every other citizen.</P>
<P>As the <HI>head of a family</HI> he &s;hould act as a prie&s;t in his own hou&s;e, by endeavoring to bring up his children in the nurture, and admonition of the Lord.</P>
<P>As a <HI>magi&s;trate</HI> he &s;hould be as a nur&s;ing fa|ther to the church of Chri&s;t, by protecting all the peaceable members of it from injury on ac|count of religion; and by &s;ecuring to them the uninterrupted enjoyment of equal religious li|berty. The authority by which he acts he de|rives alike from <HI>all the people.</HI> con&s;equently he &s;hould exerci&s;e that authority <HI>equally</HI> for the be|nefit of <HI>all,</HI> without any re&s;pect to their different religious principles. They have an undoubted right to demand it.</P>
<P>UNION in the &s;tate is of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity to its happine&s;s. This the magi&s;trate will &s;tudy to promote. And this he may rea&s;onably expect upon the plan propo&s;ed, of a <HI>ju&s;t and equal treatment of all the citizens.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="016537_0029_0F9C8E2E18187118">
FOR though chri&s;tians may contend among&s;t them&s;elves about their religious differences, they will all unite to promote the good of the com|munity, becau&s;e it is their intere&s;t, &s;o long as they all enjoy the ble&s;&s;ings of a free, and equal admini&s;tration of government.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, if the magi&s;trate de&s;troys the equality of the &s;ubjects of the &s;tate on account of religion, he violates a fundamental principle of a free government, e&s;tabli&s;hes &s;eparate intere&s;ts in it, and lays a foundation for di&s;affection to rulers, and endle&s;s quarrels among the people.</P>

<P>PERMIT me on this occa&s;ion to introduce the words of the Rev. Dr. Chauncy, who&s;e age and experience add weight to his &s;entiments.

<P>IT is well known to this re&s;pectable a&s;&s;embly, that chri&s;tianity flouri&s;hed remarkably for the &s;pace of three hundred years after the a&s;cen&s;ion of Chri&s;t, amid&s;t the hotte&s;t and mo&s;t bloody per&s;ecutions, and when the powers of the world were again&s;t it; and began to decline im|mediately upon its being made a <HI>legal e&s;tabli&s;h|ment</HI> by Con&s;tantine, the fir&s;t chri&s;tian emperor. Who heaped upon it his ill-judged favors, and introduced a train of evils which he had not de&s;igned.</P>
<P>THE preachers of this divine religion were no &s;ooner taken into the favor of the prince, and their &s;entiments e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, than they began to quarrel who &s;hould be the greate&s;t; and anathematized one another.&mdash;Every man who has read the hi&s;tory of the four fir&s;t gene|ral councils, is fully &s;atisfied of the truth of the&s;e remarks.</P>
<P>SEEING then, chri&s;tianity made its way in the beginning, when the powers of the world were again&s;t it, let us chearfully leave it to the force of its own evidence, and to the care of its adorable author; while we &s;trictly attend to all tho&s;e means, which he hath in&s;tituted for the propagation of it. The mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t are particularly called upon to <HI>preach the word, to be in&s;tant in &s;ea&s;on, out of &s;ea&s;on;</HI> to teach the

<P>UPON the whole, I think it is a plain, as well as a very important truth, that the <HI>church of Chri&s;t</HI> and <HI>a common-wealth are e&s;&s;entially different.</HI> The one is a <HI>religious</HI> &s;ociety, of which Chri&s;t is the &s;ole head, and which he gathers out of the world, in common, by the di&s;pen&s;ation of his go&s;pel, governs by his laws in all matters of reli|gion, a compleat code of which we have in the &s;acred &s;criptures; and pre&s;erves it by his power.</P>
<P>THE other is a <HI>civil</HI> &s;ociety, originating with the people, and de&s;igned to promote their <HI>tem|poral intere&s;ts.</HI> Which is governed by men, who&s;e authority is derived from their fellow-citizens, and confined to the affairs of this world.</P>
<P>IN this view of the matter, the line appears to me to be fairly drawn, between <HI>the things that belong to Cae&s;ar,</HI> and <HI>the things that belong to God.</HI> The magi&s;trate is to govern the <HI>&s;tate,</HI> and Chri&s;t is to govern the <HI>church.</HI> The former will find bu&s;ine&s;s enough in the complex affairs of government, to employ all his time and abilities.

We will neither import nor purcha&s;e any &s;laves im|ported after the fir&s;t day of December next; after which time we will <HI>wholly di&s;continue the &s;lave trade;</HI> and will neither be concerned in it our&s;elves, nor will we hire our ve&s;&s;els, nor &s;ell our commodities or manufactures to tho&s;e who are con|cerned in it.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>THE Deity hath be&s;towed upon them and us the &s;ame natural rights as men; and hath a&s;&s;igned to them a part of the globe for their re&s;idence. But mankind, urged by tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which de|ba&s;e the human mind, have pur&s;ued them to their native country; and by &s;ometing wars among them, that they might &s;ecure the pri&s;oners, or employing villains to decoy the unwary, have filled their &s;hips with the unfortunate captives; dragged them from their tendere&s;t connections, and tran&s;ported them to different parts of the
<PB N="35" REF="016537_0034_0F9C8E317252C448">
earth, to be hewers of wood, and drawers of water, till death &s;hall end their painful captivity.</P>
<P>To reconcile this nefarious traffic with rea&s;on, humanity, religion, or the principles of a free government, in my view, requires an uncom|mon addre&s;s.</P>
<P>SHOULD we make the ca&s;e our own, and act agreeable to that excellent rule of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, <HI>whatever ye would that men &s;hould do to you, do ye to them likewi&s;e,</HI> the abolition of this di&s;graceful practice would take place.</P>
<P>NOR can I conceive that we &s;hall act a con|&s;i&s;tent part, till we brand this &s;pecies of tyranny with perpetual infamy. Shall we hold the &s;word in one hand to defend our ju&s;t rights as men; and gra&s;p chains with the other to en&s;lave the inhabitants of Africa?&mdash;Forbid it heaven!&mdash;Forbid it all the free-born &s;ons of this we&s;tern world!&mdash;</P>
<P>MAY the year of jubilee &s;oon arrive, when Africa &s;hall ca&s;t the look of gratitude to the&s;e happy regions, for the TOTAL EMANCIPATION of HER SONS!&mdash;</P>
<P>THIS matter, among others, de&s;erves the &s;erious attention of our Honorable Rulers, in whom their fellow-citizens have repo&s;ed uncom|mon confidence, which is apparent in calling
<PB N="36" REF="016537_0035_0F9C8E3227EA7D98">
them forth to public &s;ervice at &s;uch a difficult period as this; which undoubtedly calls for the united exertions of the greate&s;t abilities.</P>
<P>THE voice of the people is, as mentioned before, and the importance of the matter ju&s;ti|fies the repetition of it; I &s;ay, the voice of the people is, that government &s;hould pay their fir&s;t attention to the war. If America is re&s;pectable in the field, the greater will be the pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s in arms, and of an honorable peace.</P>
<P>LET us not amu&s;e our&s;elves with a pro&s;pect of peace, and in con&s;equence thereof abate in our preparations for the war. If we &s;hould, it may prove greatly injurious to <HI>the freedom and glory of this</HI> RISING EMPIRE.</P>
<P>BUT it is not for me to attempt to &s;pecify the weighty affairs, which, during the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent year, and particularly of the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion, are likely to come before the Honorable Gentlemen, who have this day called us to the place of public wor&s;hip. God grant unto them that wi&s;dom that is from above!</P>
<P>WHILE tran&s;acting public bu&s;ine&s;s, may they remember, that Jehovah <HI>&s;tandeth in the congre|gation of the mighty; and judgeth among the gods.</HI> Under the influence of this &s;olemn con&s;ideration, may the elections of this day be conducted. This being the ca&s;e, every elector, before he gives his vote for any per&s;on to &s;it in Council, will take
<PB N="37" REF="016537_0036_0F9C8E32E2E136E8">
pains to &s;atisfy him&s;elf, whether he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the qualifications that are nece&s;&s;ary for &s;o exalted a &s;tation. Such as wi&s;dom, virtue, firmne&s;s and an unfeigned love of his country. Tried friends de&s;erve the preference: An experience of who&s;e capacity and fidelity in times pa&s;t, recommends them as worthy of pre&s;ent confidence.</P>
<P>To the direction of unerring wi&s;dom we com|mit both branches of the Honorable Court; heartily wi&s;hing that they may conduct them&s;elves in every re&s;pect, as tho&s;e who are to be accounta|ble to God the judge of all. Thus will they en|joy the te&s;timony of con&s;cience, and may expect to be accepted of the multitude of their brethren.</P>
<P>IN fine. Seeing the body of chri&s;tians, how|ever divided into &s;ects and parties, "are entitled preci&s;ely to the &s;ame rights," it becomes them to re&s;t contented with that equal condition, nor to wi&s;h for pre-eminence. Rather they &s;hould rejoice to &s;ee all men as free, and as happy as them&s;elves.</P>
<P>THEY &s;hould &s;tudy to imbibe more of the &s;pirit of their divine Ma&s;ter, to love as brethren, and to pre&s;erve the unity of the &s;pirit in the bonds of peace. In the pre&s;ent &s;tate of igno|rance and prejudice they cannot expect to &s;ee eye to eye. There will be a variety of opinions and modes of wor&s;hip among the di&s;ciples of the &s;ame Lord; men equally hone&s;t, pious, and &s;en&s;ible, while they remain in this world of im|perfection.
<PB N="38" REF="016537_0037_0F9C8E33A2047730">
Let them therefore be faithful to their re&s;pective principles, and kind, and forbear|ing towards one another. Their chief &s;tudy &s;hould be to advance the cau&s;e of morality and religion in the world; and by their good works to glorify their Father who is in heaven.</P>
<P>THEY are to be &s;ubject to the civil magi&s;trate, not only for wrath, but al&s;o for con&s;cience &s;ake; and to <HI>pray for all who are in authority,</HI> that <HI>under them they may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty. For this is good and acceptable in the &s;ight of God.</HI> To whom be glory for ever.</P>
