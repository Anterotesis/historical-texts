<HEAD>A DISCOURSE ON THE PRINCIPLE OF VITALITY.</HEAD>
<P>WERE the European Philo&s;opher to turn his eyes on this new Empire, to &s;ee in what order and degree tho&s;e di&s;po|&s;itions and arts, which characterize poli&s;hed humanity, ari&s;e among us, he would undoubtedly perceive that the exten&s;ion of benevolence has kept exact pace with the diffu&s;ion of knowledge.</P>
<P>Our venerable ance&s;tors early &s;owed the &s;eeds of &s;cience in this land, and watched their growth with pious care; and it is not difficult to di&s;cover the diffu&s;ive &s;pirit of benevolence following every where the encrea&s;ing light of &s;cience.</P>
<P>Without being particular on this head, one in&s;tance of it honourable to humanity, is the cordial adoption, and gene|rous &s;upport given to this <HI>Humane Society,</HI> which is formed on a very exten&s;ive &s;cale of benevolence.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="023038_0006_0FBC1BF5E459AA00">
I decline giving a hi&s;tory of this or &s;imilar in&s;titutions; nor &s;hall I de&s;cant on the beneficial influence of tho&s;e numerous humane a&s;&s;ociations, which mark and dignify the age in which we live. Suffice it to &s;ay, that the &s;ucce&s;s attending the Socie|ties e&s;tabli&s;hed for re&s;toring drowned per&s;ons at <HI>Am&s;terdam, Hamburgh, London, Padua, Vienna, Paris</HI> and el&s;ewhere, in|duced &s;ome re&s;pectable characters to form one in Bo&s;ton. But they have gone beyond the European Societies, and have extended their plan not only to the re&s;toration of life, when apparently lo&s;t, but to the pre&s;ervation of it when in imminent danger.</P>
<P>It is &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay that the plan of this Society is totally void of all private intere&s;ted views. None of its members receive any other recompence than the &s;ublime joy of doing good.</P>
<P>I &s;hall avoid &s;peaking of any particular mode of treating per&s;ons apparently dead, and &s;hall confine my&s;elf to the great principle of VITALITY, ANIMATION, or LIFE. I feel the difficulty of doing ju&s;tice to &s;o copious a &s;ubject in the &s;hort &s;pace allotted to a di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject of animation is not merely curious, but leads to u&s;efulne&s;s. It has arre&s;ted the attention of Philo&s;ophers in almo&s;t every age of the world. Some of the antients rea&s;oned thus on it, matter of it&s;elf cannot move, yet it is evident all

things change, and that nothing is truly lo&s;t; that the &s;um total of matter in the Univer&s;e remains perfectly the &s;ame; and as it was the work of OMNIPOTENCE to create &s;omething out of nothing, the &s;ame Omnipotence is required to reduce any thing back to nothing.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Bacon's account of antient opinions.</NOTE> It is apparent that there is an univer|&s;al change, or mutation of all things into all, then mu&s;t there be &s;ome <HI>one primary matter,</HI> common to all things out of which they were made&mdash;They went &s;till further, and enquired into the <HI>moving principle,</HI> the <HI>efficient cau&s;e,</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>that cau&s;e,</HI> which a&s;&s;ociates the elements of natural &s;ub&s;tances, and which employs them when a&s;&s;ociated, according to their various and peculiar characters<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Harris philo&s;. arrang.</NOTE> This moving principle they called the <HI>Anima Mundi,</HI> the <HI>Soul of the World.</HI></P>
<P>THALES, one of the &s;even wi&s;e men of Greece, maintained, that <HI>Water</HI> was the &s;ubtile principle that moved all things. He concluded &s;o, from ob&s;erving that matter was chiefly dealt out in moi&s;ture; that the &s;eeds of plants &s;o long as they are in a growing &s;tate, are moi&s;t; and that a vegetable will grow to a con&s;iderable &s;ize from water alone; that the Earth is refre&s;hed, recruited and made fruitful by water:&mdash;that the Air it&s;elf is but an expan&s;ion, or expiration of water. He reminds us of the immen&s;e quantities in the &s;ubterraneous regions, whence fountains, and rivers, like &s;o many veins in the body, convey water over the &s;urface, and through the bowels of our Globe, to vivify and &s;u&s;tain the whole.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="023038_0008_0FBC1BF8FAEB1588">
HERACLITUS maintained a very different doctrine. He taught that <HI>Fire</HI> was the vivifying principle of all things. He allowed the truth of <HI>Thales'</HI> doctrine, but ob&s;erved that <HI>fire</HI> had &s;uch an univer&s;al &s;way in nature, that water it&s;elf was not without a mixture of it; for that water grows hard and congeals into Ice when fire leaves it, and is only re&s;tored to its fluidity by entering it again. He remarked that the whole ma&s;s of waters in the &s;ea, was actually an ocean of fire, &s;eeing there were not two di&s;tinct drops of water, which do not owe their fluidity to &s;ome portion of fire enclo&s;ed within them. So deeply rooted was the doctrine that fire was the fir&s;t or animating principle, that there were, and &s;till are whole nations who wor&s;hip it as a Deity.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>That venerable &s;ect of Philo&s;ophers, the <HI>Stoics,</HI> taught that there was one infinite eternal, almighty mind, which being diffu&s;ed through the whole univer&s;e of well ordered and regularly di&s;po&s;ed matter, actuates every part of it, and is as it were the &s;oul of this <HI>va&s;t body.</HI> The parts of this body they &s;ay, are of two &s;orts, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the <HI>Cele&s;tial,</HI> as the Planets and fixed &s;tars: and the <HI>Terre&s;trial.</HI> as the Earth, and all the other elements about it. The cele&s;tial continue without change, or variation. But the whole &s;ublunary world, is not only liable to di&s;&s;olution, but often hath been, and &s;hall again be di&s;&s;olved by <HI>fire</HI> and that the reciprocal deaths, di&s;&s;olutions and dige&s;tions, which &s;upport by turns all the &s;ub&s;tances which we &s;ee, are the effects of <HI>fire.</HI></P><BIBL>See CREECH'<HI>s preface to the tran&s;lation of</HI> C. MANILIUS.</BIBL></NOTE></P>
<P>ANAXIMENES contradicted both the&s;e philo&s;ophers; and contended that <HI>Air</HI> was the vivifying principle and fir&s;t mover of all things. He ob&s;erved that although the water of <HI>Thales</HI> could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t without the fire of <HI>Heraclitus,</HI> yet fire it&s;elf could not exi&s;t without <HI>Air,</HI> which was the very &s;pirit of flame and the breath of life. That no &s;eed of vegetables, eggs

of animals, be they ever &s;o ripe, or pregnant, and cheri&s;hed with ever &s;o kindly a warmth, will ever bring forth the embryos contained in them, if they be totally deprived of air. We &s;hall &s;ee hereafter the nece&s;&s;ity of attending to the&s;e powerful agents, <HI>fire</HI> and <HI>air,</HI> in the re&s;u&s;citation of tho&s;e apparently dead by &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, &s;ubmer&s;ion, or fro&s;t.</P>
<P>Let us now examine the &s;ubject of animation with the light afforded us by more modern Philo&s;ophers.</P>
<P>From them we learn that matter is inert, that any one particle of matter left to it&s;elf will continue always in the &s;ame &s;tate, with regard to its motion or re&s;t. There are, however, certain powers. which <HI>two</HI> particles of matter have of acting on one another, as in gravitation and cohe&s;ion. We learn al&s;o that there is an attraction of <HI>chry&s;tallization,</HI> by which bodies when fluid become in time &s;olid, and a&s;&s;ume a particu|lar figure; that there is an attraction of <HI>magneti&s;m,</HI> by which a piece of iron in certain circum&s;tances, attracts another piece of iron: that there is an attraction of <HI>electricity,</HI> by which a &s;ub&s;tance charged with more electric matter flies to another charged with le&s;s. There is, moreover, <HI>chemical attraction,</HI> by which two particles of different bodies ru&s;h together, and form one. If we add that mo&s;t of the&s;e have their oppo&s;ite repul&s;ions, we can &s;ay that they are all the known properties of mere matter; and there is nothing in them that can merit the name of <HI>vitality</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="023038_0010_0FBBA0FC0B52F8B8">
But there is in a growing vegetable a power beyond all this, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> a power which fir&s;t moves, and then conducts that latent proce&s;s by which a &s;eed becomes a plant.</P>
<P>Now, every body capable of growing, has a certain internal adju&s;tment, di&s;po&s;ition, or arrangement of its matter, which is called <HI>organization;</HI> and being capable of encrea&s;ing in bulk has a certain degree of <HI>vitality.</HI> There is a &s;cale of life, &s;tretch|ing in uniform gradation from human excellence downwards, till it di&s;appears in a &s;hade of ambiguity, in the living &s;tate of vegetables.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Brown.</NOTE> Life, &s;ays the <HI>Bi&s;hop of Landaff,</HI> belongs alike to both the animal and vegetable kingdom, and &s;eems to depend on the &s;ame principle in both. Stop the motion of a fluid in an animal limb, by a &s;trong ligature, the limb mortifies beyond the ligature and drops off; a branch of a tree, under like circum&s;tances, grows dry and rots away.&mdash;Both animals and vegetables are &s;ubject to be fro&s;t-bitten and to con&s;equent mortifications; both langui&s;h in exce&s;&s;ive heats; both experi|ence extrava&s;ation of juices from repletion, and pinings from inanition; both can &s;uffer amputation of limbs without being deprived of life, and in a &s;imilar manner both form a callus; both are liable to contract di&s;ea&s;e by infection; both are &s;trengthened by air and motion.</P>
<P>Every &s;eed of a plant is an organized body endowed with ve&s;&s;els, and contains under &s;everal membranes the plant in miniature.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Look at the engravings in <HI>Grew's anatomy of plants.</HI></NOTE> If this &s;eed be put into the <HI>moi&s;t</HI> earth, and a

certain degree of <HI>heat</HI> applied, with a free acce&s;s of <HI>air,</HI> (the three principles of the antient Philo&s;ophers) the juice in the&s;e ve&s;&s;els will expand by the warmth; and being thus once put in motion, gradually encrea&s;e, and grow up into a plant; which plant produces a &s;imilar &s;eed, capable of propagating it's kind forever.</P>
<P>In like manner an Egg is an organized body, which con|tains under &s;everal envelopements the chicken in miniature, and may be con&s;idered as a womb, detached from the body of the parent animal, in which the embryo is ju&s;t beginning to be formed; if warmed to a certain degree, whether by the parent animal, or by art, the fluids which &s;urround that &s;peck in the egg called the <HI>punctum vitae,</HI> expand, and the little ve&s;&s;els &s;well and extend them&s;elves; and the motion, or o&s;cillation once began, it develops, by degrees, until it becomes a perfect animal, capable of all the functions common to its kind.</P>
<P>The &s;eed of the vegetable, and the egg of the animal would remain, or rather <HI>become</HI> effete and inanimate, unle&s;s &s;ome &s;timulus, &s;ome agent <HI>from without,</HI> excited or began a motion in them. But what is this agent, or &s;timulus? For that is the que&s;tion.&mdash;</P>
<P>This &s;timulus, or animating principle in a natural body, does not depend on its organization, nor its figure, nor any of tho&s;e inferior forms, which make up the &s;y&s;tem of its vi&s;ible
<PB N="8" REF="023038_0012_0FBBA100533461C0">
qualities; but it is the <HI>power,</HI> which not being that organiza|tion, nor that figure, nor tho&s;e qualities, is yet able to produce, to pre&s;erve, and to employ them. It is therefore the <HI>power,</HI> which departing, the body cea&s;es to live, and the members &s;oon pa&s;s into putrefaction and decay.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Harris Phil. Arrang.</NOTE></P>
<P>From an attentive ob&s;ervation of animated nature, we di&s;cover that life is cau&s;ed, and continued by &s;omething which acts from without; and this &s;omething is (as far as we can di&s;cover) <HI>heat,</HI> acting on the &s;eed or egg. I &s;ay <HI>heat,</HI> accord|ing to the common acceptation of the term: but to &s;peak more philo&s;ophically, it is <HI>that &s;ubtil electric fluid, which fills the immen&s;e &s;pace of the whole Univer&s;e, pervades all bodies, and actuates every particle of matter. Heat</HI> is only one effect of its motion.</P>
<P>In whatever manner a &s;u&s;ceptible or irritable body is operated upon by this exciting power, a certain quantity of it, or a certain energy, is a&s;&s;igned and belongs to every individual &s;y&s;tem upon the commencement of its living &s;tate.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Brown.</P>
<P><HI>Anatomical De&s;cription of a Hen's-egg; with the hi&s;tory of the growth of the animal contained in it.</HI></P>
<P>IMmediately under the &s;hell, lies that common membrane, or &s;kin, which lines it on the in&s;ide, adhering clo&s;ely to it every where, except at the broad end, where a little cavity is left, that is <HI>filled with air;</HI> which encrea&s;es as the animal within grows larger. Under this membrane are contained <HI>two whites,</HI> tho' &s;eeming to us to be only <HI>one:</HI> each wrapped up in a membrane of it's own, one white within the other. In the mid&s;t of all is the <HI>yolk,</HI> wrapt round likewi&s;e with it's own mem|brane&punc; At each end of this are two ligaments, called <HI>chalazae,</HI> which are white den&s;e &s;ub&s;tances, made from the membranes, and &s;erving to keep the white and the yolk in their places.</P>
<P>The <HI>cicatricula</HI> is the part where the animal fir&s;t begins to &s;hew &s;igns of life; it re&s;embles a vetch or &s;mall pea, lying on one &s;ide of the yolk and within its mem|branes. The outer membranes and ligaments pre&s;erve the fluids in their proper places, the white &s;erves as nouri&s;hment; and the yolk with its membranes, after a time, becomes a part of the chicken's body. This is the de&s;cription of the <HI>hen's egg,</HI> and an&s;wers to all others, how large or how &s;mall &s;oever.</P>
<P>Previou&s;ly to putting the eggs to the hen, <HI>Malpighi</HI> and <HI>Haller</HI> fir&s;t examined this cicatricula, which they con&s;ider as the mo&s;t important part of the egg. This (which &s;ome call the <HI>punctum &s;aliens,</HI> or <HI>punctum vitae,</HI>) was found in tho&s;e that were im|pregnated by the male to be large, but in others &s;mall. Upon examination with the micro&s;cope it was found to be a kind of bag, containing a tran&s;parent liquor, in the mid&s;t of which the <HI>embryo</HI> was &s;een. The embryo re&s;embled a compo&s;ition of little threads, which the warmth of future incubation tended to enlarge.</P>
<P>Upon placing the egg in a proper warmth, after &s;ix hours the <HI>vital &s;peck</HI> begins to dilate like the pupil of he eye. The head of the chicken is di&s;tinctly &s;een, with the back-bone &s;omething re&s;embling a tadpole floating in its ambient fluid, but as yet &s;eeming to a&s;&s;ume none of the functions of animal life. About &s;ix hours more the little animal is &s;een more di&s;tinctly; the head becomes more plainly vi&s;ible, and the vertebrae of the back more ea&s;ily perceivable. All the&s;e &s;igns of preparation for life are encrea&s;ed in &s;ix hours more; and, at the end of 24, the ribs begin to take their places, the neck begins to lengthen, and the head to turn to one &s;ide.</P>
<P>At this time, the fluids in the egg &s;eem to have changed place; the yolk which was before in the center of the &s;hell, approaches nearer the broad end. The watery part of the white is dimini&s;hed the gro&s;&s;er part &s;inks to the &s;mall end; and the little animal appears to turn towards the part of the broad end in which a cavity has been de&s;cribed, and with its yolk &s;eems to adhere to the membrane there&punc;</P>
<P>At the end of 40 hours the great work of life &s;eems fairly begun, and the animal plainly appears to move; the back bone thickens; the fir&s;t rudiments of the eyes begin to appear; the eart beats, and the blood begins already to circulate. The parts, however, as yet are fluid; but, by degrees, become more and more tena|cious. At the end of two days, the liquor in which the chicken &s;wims. &s;eems to encrea&s;e; the head appears with two little bladders in place of eyes; the heart beats in the manner of every embryo where the blood does not circulate through the lungs. In about 14 hours after this, the chicken is grown more &s;trong; the veins and the arteries begin to branch, in order to form the brain&punc; and the &s;pinal marrow is &s;een &s;tretching along the back-bone. In three days, the whole body of the chicken appears bent; the head with it's two eye-balls, with their different humours, now di&s;tinctly appear; and five other ve&s;icles are &s;een, which &s;oon unite to form the rudiments of the brain. The out-lines al&s;o of the thighs, and wings, begin to be &s;een, and the body begins to gather fle&s;h. At the end of the fourth day, the ve&s;icles that go to form the brain approach each other the wings and things appear more &s;olid; the whole body is covered with a jelly like fle&s;h; the heart, that was hitherto expo&s;ed is now covered up within the body, by a very thin tran&s;parent membrane; and at the &s;ame time the umbilical ve&s;&s;els, that unite the animal to the yolk, now appear to come forth from the abdomen. After the 5th and 6th days the ve&s;&s;els of the brain begin to be covered over; the wings and thighs lengthen; the belly is clo&s;ed up, and turned; the liver is &s;een within it, very di&s;tinctly, not yet grown red, but of a du&s;ky white: both the ventricles of the heart are di&s;cerned, as if they were two &s;eparate hearts&punc; beating di&s;tinctly; the whole body of the animal is covered over, and the traces of the incipient feathers are already to be &s;een. The 7th day, the head appears very large; the brain is covered entirely over the bill begins to appear betwixt the eyes, and the wings, the thighs, and the legs, have acquired their perfect figure. Hitherto, however, the animal appears as if it had two bodies; the yolk is joined to it by the umbilical ve&s;&s;els that come from the belly and is furni&s;hed with its ve&s;&s;els, through which the blood circulates, as through the re&s;t of the body of the chicken, making a bulk greater than that of the animal it&s;elf. But towards the end of incubation, the umbi|lical ve&s;&s;els &s;horten the yolk, and with it the inte&s;tines are thru&s;t up into the body of the chicken by the action of the mu&s;cles of the belly, and the two bodies are thus formed into one During this &s;tate, all the organs are found to perform their &s;ecretions; the bile is found to be &s;eperated, as in grown animals; but it is tran&s;pa|rent, and without bitterne&s;s; the chicken then al&s;o appears to have lungs. On the 10th&punc; the mu&s;cles of the wings appear, and the feathers begin to pu&s;h out. On the 11th, the heart which hitherto had appeared divided, begins to unite, the arteries which belong to it, join into it, like the fingers into the palm of the hand. All the&s;e appearances, come more into view, becau&s;e the fluids the ve&s;&s;els had hitherto' &s;ecreted, were more tran&s;parent; but as the colour of the fluids deepen, their opera|tions and circulations are more di&s;tinctly &s;een. As the animal thus, by the 11th day, completely formed, begins to gather &s;trength, it becomes more unea&s;y in its &s;ituation, and exerts its animal powers with encrea&s;ing force.

<P>Every body knows that although the child is formed, and lives, and grows, and moves in the womb of its mother, it never breathes there. It receives its animating principle, its

heat, motion and life from the mother, by a nerve and artery, which enters at its navel and conveys the blood to the heart of the infant, <HI>without ever pa&s;&s;ing through the lungs.</HI> The blood in this ca&s;e goes directly on through the body of the heart, by an opening called the <HI>Foramen Ovale,</HI> and from thence to the <HI>Aorta,</HI> or great Artery, by which it is driven to every part of its body; &s;o that the circulation, nutrition and life, are kept up with the mother, as if they were not two bodies but one. It is remarkable that the fruit of vegetables is, in like manner, nouri&s;hed, and &s;upported by a &s;lender &s;talk i&s;&s;uing from the parent &s;tock.</P>
<P>When the child is born it becomes dependent on a <HI>new</HI> principle for the continuance of its exi&s;tence. When it pa&s;&s;es from its watery habitation into the atmo&s;phere, a new determi|nation takes place; and in&s;tead of the <HI>umbilical cord</HI> from the mother, the common air becomes the <HI>main-&s;pring</HI> of all its actions and functions.

<P>Then will <HI>CHARITY,</HI> that bright con&s;tellation of chri&s;tian virtues, always be pre&s;ent with us; under who&s;e fo&s;tering in|fluence, we hope, this yet infant Society, this &s;tanding com|mittee of humanity, will extend, &s;o far and wide, it's &s;aluti|ferous effects, that future generations will have rea&s;on to com|memorate it's exertions with grateful admiration!</P>
