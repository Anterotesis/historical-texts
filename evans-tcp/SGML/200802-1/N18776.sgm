<HEAD>DEDICATION. To JOSEPH WARD, ESQ.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO you, as a de&s;cendant from the fir&s;t generation of the inhabitants of Newton, permit me to in&s;cribe the following di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>IT originated in a de&s;ire of promot|ing the moral and religious improve|ment of a people (de&s;ervedly dear to their Pa&s;tor) who&s;e fathers have long &s;ince &s;lept in death.</P>
<P>AMONG the&s;e, the name of Ward has &s;hone with an amiable and con&s;pic|uous lu&s;tre. The character of your ance&s;tors, from the beginning of this &s;ettlement, has engaged the e&s;teem of their contemporaries, who, in con&s;e|quence, have cho&s;en them to the fir&s;t civil and religious offices of tru&s;t a|mong them.</P>
<P>OF the&s;e, your late pious father claims a particular remembrance, for the many virtues, which di&s;tingui&s;hed him through life.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="024406_0004_0FC70EFF1704AB70">YOU, Sir, ju&s;tly e&s;teem it a greater honour, to derive your de&s;cent from ance&s;tors, who feared GOD, and were ble&s;&s;ings in their day, than from men, who have the blood of princes in their veins.</P>
<P>YOUR fir&s;t wi&s;h for the town, which gave you birth, is, that its inhabitants, to the late&s;t po&s;terity, may emulate the virtues of their fathers, who con&s;idered the religion of JESUS, as the rule of life, and the pure&s;t &s;ource of felicity. May you and yours &s;hare in this be|nevolent wi&s;h! May you long live, and cheri&s;h tho&s;e habits of philanthro|py, which have hitherto &s;hed a lu&s;tre on your character, and render you a rich ble&s;&s;ing to &s;ociety! May your children, and children's children, to the mo&s;t di&s;tant generation, continue to adorn the name of <HI>Ward</HI> with every attractive and u&s;eful virtue,</P>

<P>"ONE GENERATION PASSETH AWAY, AND ANOTHER GENERA|TION COMETH."</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE book of Eccle&s;ia&s;tes is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been penned by Solomon in the latter pe|riod of his life, when he deeply felt the vanity of the world, and his own folly in complying with its temptations. He &s;eems to wi&s;h the pre&s;erva|tion of others from the&s;e temptations, whil&s;t they eyed his &s;ad experience, as a beacon, erected to warn them, of the rocks and quick-&s;ands in the &s;ea of life. He employs this book, to teach them the vanity of all &s;ublunary enjoyments, and to rec|ommend the love of GOD and obedience to his will, as the mo&s;t &s;olid good, and the noble&s;t end of their being.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="024406_0006_0FC70F0548B2FD60">THOUGH the &s;on of the celebrated David, and king of I&s;rael, who&s;e throne was the mo&s;t &s;plen|did then on the globe, yet he readily undertook the office of a Preacher or religious in&s;tructor to his brethren of mankind. "Vanity of vanities, vanity of vanities, all is vanity," is the leading theme of his di&s;cour&s;e. "What profit," con|tinues he, "hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the &s;un?" He derives no la&s;t|ing bli&s;s from tho&s;e toils, which are confined to the pre&s;ent life. "One generation pa&s;&s;eth away, and another generation cometh." His &s;tay on earth is tran&s;ient. He pa&s;&s;es off the &s;tage, to make room for his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, who, in their turn, mu&s;t give place to tho&s;e behind them. "But the earth abideth forever." He is more frail than the globe which he inhabits. For though this is devoted to de&s;truction at the appointed clo&s;e of its &s;cenes, yet it &s;urvives the wreck of many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive generations, and affords its living actors an opportunity to cheri&s;h and di&s;play tho&s;e virtues, which alone will crown them with im|mortality.</P>
<P>SOLEMN and deeply intere&s;ting to every mortal is the &s;entiment of our text.</P>
<P>NUMEROUS generations have trodden this earthly &s;tage before us. In&s;tead of the fathers, have been the children, who have rapidly &s;ucceed|ed to the paternal relation, and then yielded their places to po&s;terity.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ent period, which is the concluding LORD's Day of the year, and the commencement of a new century to this town, that received its

It has been di&s;tingui&s;hed by the latter only for many years pa&s;t.</P></NOTE> has led me to the choice of tho&s;e applicable and emphatic words, "One generation pa&s;&s;eth away, and another generation cometh."</P>
<P>SOLOMON, though dead, yet &s;peaks to us by them, and urges us &s;o to improve our rapidly re|volving days, as &s;hall be&s;t accompli&s;h the de&s;ign of life, and embalm our memory upon our depar|ture from the body.</P>
<P>WHEN man by his apo&s;ta&s;y had &s;ubjected him&s;elf to death, the great Arbiter of human life &s;aw fit, in the early age of the world, to po&s;tpone the execution of the &s;entence to the di&s;tance of &s;everal centuries. One generation did not pa&s;s away, and another generation come, with the ra|pidity of following periods.</P>
<P>THE antediluvians were permitted to &s;ee &s;even, eight, and nine centuries of years. Their &s;low progre&s;s to complete manhood, appears to have borne &s;ome proportion to their longevity. Sixty five, ninety, one hundred and five, and even one hundred and &s;ixty two, are the advanced years, in which the paternal relation &s;eems to be fir&s;t form|ed among them.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Gen. v.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="024406_0008_0FC70F0BCA3EFC60">HOWEVER, new and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive generations came on the &s;tage, fa&s;ter than tho&s;e preceding were called to leave it.</P>
<P>AGREEABLY to the computation of the He|brew text, Adam lived two hundred and forty three years with Methu&s;aleh of the eighth generation, and fifty &s;ix years with Lamech of the ninth, and the father of Noah.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Adam died A.

Abram was born A.

<P>UPWARDS of three thou&s;and years have revolv|ed &s;ince the date of this &s;tandard. During this &s;pace the various generations of mankind have left the &s;tage, or &s;ucceeded to it in a &s;imilar man|ner. One generation has pa&s;&s;ed away, and anoth|er has come much within the &s;ame period.</P>
<P>THE ancients, among whom we reckon the &s;acred hi&s;torians, often computed by genera|tions. Our Saviour's birth has been traced from Abraham in this way: But there has been a dis|agreement among writers in fixing the exact num|ber of years, which con&s;titutes a generation. Job is &s;aid to have "lived one hundred and forty years" after his calamities, and to have "&s;een his &s;ons, and his &s;ons &s;ons, even four generations." The ancient poets u&s;ed the term age in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e with generation. Ne&s;tor, the wi&s;e Grecian general at the &s;iege of Troy, is repre&s;ented by Homer as having lived three ages (i. e. of thirty years each) or ninety years.</P>
<P>WE have already &s;een that a generation is to be computed longer in the antediluvian, than in the po&s;tdiluvian world.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="024406_0010_0FC70F14DB459528">IN different climates, at the pre&s;ent day, it is to be variou&s;ly computed. In the Ea&s;t Indies the generations of the natives go off, and come on in a very rapid manner. Tho&s;e years, which are the vigour of manhood among us, con&s;titute old age with them.</P>
<P>AMONG us thirty three years appear to be a proper mean number, by which we may generally calculate our &s;ucce&s;&s;ive generations.</P>
<P>AMIDST the ravages of the human race, which death continually makes, it is a circum&s;tance, which requires gratitude to divine Providence, that a whole generation is not &s;wept off at once, and that a new generation gradually &s;ucceeds, and fills up the vacancy, which was made by the removal of their ance&s;tors. Were it not for tho&s;e births, which are con&s;tantly repairing the wa&s;tes of death, the &s;cene, which is now acting by the king of terrors, would fill us with &s;uch &s;urpri&s;e and di&s;tre&s;s, as would entirely unfit us for the bu&s;ine&s;s, the duties, and the innocent enjoyments of life.</P>
<P>THE removal of the generation of which we are a part, is &s;o gradual, that we &s;carcely realize the havoc, which is making by the fell de&s;troyer of our race. What our &s;en&s;ations would be, if the generation, with which we are conver&s;ant, were taken at once from our eyes, we may judge from the following &s;tory of an old man, who had groaned in confinement for forty &s;even years between four thick and cold &s;tone walls in the late Ba&s;tile of France.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His crime was uttering &s;ome unguarded expre&s;&s;ions, imply+ing di&s;re&s;pect concerning Louis XV.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="024406_0011_0FC70F1D202B90B0"><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>M. Mercier.&mdash;See American edition of the Encyclopedia, Article, Ba&s;tile.</P><P>As the whole account of this wretched man is remarkable, the curio&s;ity of the reader may be gratified by &s;ubjoining in this note the preceding part of it, which, as not immediately con|nected with our &s;ubject, was omitted in the &s;ermon.</P><P>"Hardened by adver&s;ity, which &s;trengthens both the mind and the con&s;titution, when they are not overpowered by it, he had re&s;i&s;ted the horrors of his long impri&s;onment with an invincible and manly &s;pirit. His locks thin, white, and &s;cattered, had al|mo&s;t acquired the rigidity of iron, whil&s;t his body, environed for &s;o long a time by a coffin of &s;tone, had borrowed from it a firm and compact habit. The narrow door of his tomb, turning upon its grating hinges, opened not as u&s;ual by halves; and an unknown voice bade him depart. Believing this to be a dream, he he&s;itated, but at length ro&s;e up, and walked forth with trem|bling &s;teps, amazed at the &s;pace he traver&s;ed. The &s;tairs of the pri&s;on, the halls, the court, &s;eemed to him va&s;t, immen&s;e, and almo&s;t without bounds. He &s;topped from time to time, and gazed around like a bewildered traveller. His vi&s;ion was with difficulty reconciled to the clear light of day. He contemplated the heavens as a new object. His eyes remained fixed, and he could not even weep. Stupified with the newly acquired pow|er of changing his po&s;ition, his limbs, like his tongue, refu&s;ed, in &s;pite of his efforts, to perform their office. At length he got through the formidable gate. When he felt the motion of the carriage prepared to tran&s;port him to his former habitation, he &s;creamed out, and uttered &s;ome inarticulate &s;ounds; and as he could not bear this new movement, he was obliged to de&s;cend, and to move by the &s;upport of a benevolent arm."</P></NOTE>"AT the acce&s;&s;ion of the pre&s;ent monarch, Louis XVI. this wretched pri&s;oner was re&s;tored, with &s;everal others, to his liberty. Supported by a friendly arm, he &s;ought out the &s;treet where he had formerly re&s;ided. He found it, but no trace of his hou&s;e remained. One of the public edifices occupied the &s;pot where it had &s;tood. The hou&s;es of his neare&s;t neighbours, which were fre&s;h in his memory, had a&s;&s;umed a new appearance. Terrified, he &s;topped, and fetched a deep &s;igh. To him, what did it import, that
<PB N="12" REF="024406_0012_0FC70F1E2C8B3E78">
the city was peopled with living creatures? None of them were alive to him. He was un|known to all the world, and he knew nobody; and whil&s;t he wept, he regretted his dungeon.</P>
<P>"AT length accident brought in his way an ancient dome&s;tic, now a &s;uperannuated porter, who, confined to his lodge for fifteen years, had barely &s;ufficient &s;trength to open the gate. Even he did not know the ma&s;ter he had &s;erved. He informed him, that grief and misfortune had brought his wife to the grave thirty years before, that his children were gone abroad to di&s;tant climes, and, that of all his relations and friends, none remained. This recital was made with the indifference, which people di&s;cover for events long pa&s;t, and almo&s;t forgotton. The mi&s;erable man groaned, and groaned alone. The crowd, which gathered round him, offering only un|known features to his view, made him feel the exce&s;s of his calamities, even more than he would have done in the dreadful &s;olitude which he had left.</P>
<P>"OVERCOME with &s;orrow, he pre&s;ented him&s;elf before the mini&s;ter, to whom he owed that liber|ty, which was now a burden to him. Bowing down, he &s;aid,</P>
<P>"RESTORE me again to that pri&s;on, from which you have taken me. I cannot &s;urvive the lo&s;s of my neare&s;t relations, of my friends, and, in a word, OF A WHOLE GENERATION. Is it po&s;&s;ible, in the &s;ame moment to be informed of this UNIVERSAL DESTRUCTION, and not wi&s;h for death? This general mortality, which to the
<PB N="13" REF="024406_0013_0FC70F21B71EF640">
re&s;t of mankind comes &s;lowly and by degrees, has been to me in&s;tantaneous, the operation of a moment. Whil&s;t &s;ecluded from &s;ociety, I lived with my&s;elf only; but here I can neither live with my&s;elf, nor with this new race, to whom my angui&s;h and de&s;pair appear only as a dream. There is nothing terrible to me in dying; BUT IT IS DREADFUL INDEED TO BE THE LAST."</P>
<P>"THE mini&s;ter was melted. He cau&s;ed the old dome&s;tic to attend this unfortunate per&s;on, as only he could talk to him of his family. This di&s;cour&s;e was the &s;ingle con&s;olation, which he re|ceived: For he &s;hunned all intercour&s;e with a new race, born &s;ince he had been exiled from the world, and he pa&s;&s;ed his time in the mid&s;t of Paris, as he had done, whil&s;t confined in a dungeon for almo&s;t half a century. But the chagrin and mortification of meeting no per&s;on, who could &s;ay to him, "We were formerly known to one another," &s;oon put an end to his pre&s;ent exi&s;t|ence."</P>
<P>THOUGH &s;ome of each generation is continu|ally dropping into the grave, the more advanced generation is mo&s;t liable to a removal. But the younge&s;t generation will &s;ucceed to the place of their fathers, and &s;oon arrive at tho&s;e boundaries, beyond which they cannot pa&s;s. Our months, our years, roll on in rapid career. Numerous generations have been already hou&s;ed in the place of &s;ilence and darkne&s;s, appointed for all the liv|ing. The time will &s;oon arrive, when all, in whom the crim&s;on tide of life now flows, will follow them, and join the va&s;t majority of the dead.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="024406_0014_0FC70F25BA5D6800">WE &s;tand as in a field of battle. Our fathers, our friends, our companions, our children, are cut down on our right and our left, and warn us of our approaching fall "in that war, in which there is no di&s;charge."</P>
<P>THE &s;ceptred monarch, the privileged cour|tier, and the crouching &s;lave, are equally expo&s;ed to pa&s;s away. The learned and the illiterate, the rich and the poor, the aged and the young of each generation, mu&s;t alike &s;hift the pre&s;ent &s;cene of things, and di&s;appear from the view of behold|ers. The phy&s;ician, who&s;e friendly arm has often &s;natched his fellow men from the grave, will find all his knowledge in the healing art vain, to &s;ecure his own long abode with the liv|ing. The mini&s;ter of JESUS, who recommends that religion, which alone affords &s;olace again&s;t the approach of death, mu&s;t &s;oon bid adieu to the pious and benevolent duties of his office, and leave them to be di&s;charged by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of the following generations. His people are walk|ing with him to the end of their mortal journey, and the places, which once knew them, in the &s;anctuary, on days devoted to religious wor&s;hip, will &s;hortly know them no more. A new gen|eration will ri&s;e up, in&s;tead of the old, to attend on the in&s;titutions of the go&s;pel, to li&s;ten to the word of life, to offer their joint prayers and prai&s;es at the foot&s;tool of JEHOVAH.</P>
<P>WE are prone to congratulate tho&s;e fathers of antiquity, who &s;aw whole centuries revolve over their head, and enjoyed a kind of immortality on earth. But when we remember, that &s;uch lon|gevity
<PB N="15" REF="024406_0015_0FC70F29E3D2C2D8">
would &s;erve to lengthen out the woes of the mi&s;erable, which often can be borne with difficulty during the &s;hort period of the pre&s;ent race, that it would &s;trongly tempt us to forget the momentous truth, that we are pilgrims and &s;trangers on the earth&mdash;that it would harden the vicious in their iniquity (which appears to have been its effect on the old world) whil&s;t they viewed &s;uch a long intervening period between them and the end of their cour&s;e, the hour of their judgment; we mu&s;t acknowledge, that life is long enough, to di&s;charge the duties a&s;&s;igned us by Providence, and to prepare for that eter|nity of exi&s;tence, of which the pre&s;ent is the dawn.</P>
<P>INSTEAD therefore of finding fault with the &s;hortne&s;s and rapidity of human life in our age of the world, it becomes us to improve the portion of it, which may be allotted us, as becomes ra|tional, &s;ocial, and immortal beings.</P>
