<P>This noble knight had, in his early youth, contracted a &s;trict friend&s;hip with the only &s;on of the Lord Lovel; a gentleman of eminent virtues and accompli&s;hments. During &s;ir Phi|lip's re&s;idence in foreign countries, he had fre|quently written to his friend, and had for a time received an&s;wers; the la&s;t informed him of the death of old Lord Lovel, and the marri|age of the young one; from that time he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eard no more from him.

He took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his own hou&s;e, e&s;tabli&s;hed his hou&s;ehold, &s;ettled the old &s;er|vants in their former &s;tations, and placed tho&s;e he brought home in the upper offices of his family. He then le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t his friend to &s;uperintend his dome&s;tic affairs; and attended by only one of his old &s;ervants, he &s;et out for the ca&s;tle of Lovel, in the we&s;t of England. They travel|ed by ea&s;y journies; but, towards the evening of the &s;econd day, the &s;ervant was &s;o ill and fa|tigued, he could go no further; he &s;topped at an inn, where he grew wor&s;e every hour, and the next day expired. Sir Philip was under great concern for the lo&s;s of his &s;ervant, and &s;ome for him&s;elf, being alone in a &s;trange place; however, he took courage, ordered his &s;ervant's funeral attended it him&s;elf, and ha|ving &s;hed a tear of humanity over his grave, proceeded alone on his journey.</P>
<P>As he drew near the e&s;tate of his friend, he began to enquire of every one he met, whe|ther the Lord Lovel re&s;ided at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eat of his ance&s;tors? He was an&s;wered by one he did not know;&mdash;by another, he could not tell;&mdash;by a third he never heard of &s;uch a per&s;on. Sir Philip thought it &s;trange that a man of Lord Lovel's con&s;equence &s;hould be unknown in his own neighbourhood, and where his ance&s;tors had u&s;ually re&s;ided. He ruminated on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">tainty of human happine&s;s.

Their ill-will towards Edmund was &s;o well concealed, that his patron had not di&s;covered it: but it was whi&s;pered among the &s;ervants, who are generally clo&s;e ob&s;ervers of the man|ners of their principals.

<P>The whole cabal of his enemies con&s;ulted together in what manner they &s;hould vent their re&s;entment again&s;t him; and it was a|greed that they &s;hould treat him with indif|ference and neglect, till they &s;hould arrive in France: and when there, they &s;hould contrive to render his courage <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">pected, and by put|ting him upon &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">erate enterpri&s;e, rid them&s;elves of him forever.

<P>The young nobles and gentlemen who di|&s;tingui&s;hed Edmund, were prevented from rai&s;|ing him to preferment by the in&s;inuations of Wenlock and his a&s;&s;ociates, who never failed to &s;et before them his low de&s;cent, and his pride and arrogance in pre&s;uming to rank with gentlemen.</P>

<P>Wenlock rejoiced to find that his &s;chemes took effect, and that they &s;hould be recalled at the approach of winter. The Baron was glad of a pretence to &s;end for them home: for he could no longer endure the ab&s;ence of his children, after the lo&s;s of their mother.</P>

FROM the time the young men return|ed from France, the enemies of Edmund em|ployed their utmo&s;t abilities to ruin him in the Baron's opinion, and g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t him di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the family. They in&s;inuated a thou&s;and things again&s;t him, that happened, as they &s;aid, dur|ing his re&s;idence in France, and therefore could not be known to his ma&s;ter; but, when the Baron privately enquired of his two elder &s;ons, he found there was no truth in their re|ports. Sir Robert, though he did not love him, &s;corned to join in untruths again&s;t him. Mr. William &s;poke of him with the warmth of fraternal affection. The Baron perceived that his kin&s;men di&s;liked Edmund; but his own good heart hindered him from &s;eeing the ba&s;e|ne&s;s of theirs. It is &s;aid, that continual drop|ping will wear away a &s;tone; &s;o did their in|ce&s;&s;ant reports, by in&s;en&s;ible degrees, produce a coolne&s;s in his patron's behaviour towards him. If he behaved with manly &s;pirit, it was mi&s;con&s;trued into pride and arrogancy; his genero&s;ity was imprudence; his humility was hypocri&s;y, the better to cover his ambition. Edmund bore patiently all the indignities that were thrown upon him; and, though he felt them &s;everely in his bo&s;om, &s;corned to ju&s;tify his conduct at the expence even of his ene|mies. Perhaps his gentle &s;pirit might at length have &s;unk under this treatment, but Provi|dence interpo&s;ed in his behalf; and, by &s;eem|ingly accidental circum&s;tances, conducted him imperceptibly towards the cri&s;is of his fate.</P>

Father O&s;wald, who had been preceptor to the young men, had a &s;trong affection for Ed|mund, from a thorough knowledge of his heart; he &s;aw through the mean artifices that were u&s;ed to undermine him in his patron's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; he watched their machinations, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> rate their de&s;igns.</P>
<P>This good man u&s;ed frequently to walk out with Edmund; they conver&s;ed upon various &s;ubjects, would lament to him the unhappine&s;s of his &s;ituation, and the peculiar circum&s;tances that attended him. The father, by his whole|&s;ome advice, comforted his drooping heart; and confirmed him in his re&s;olution of bearing unavoidable evils with patience and fortitude, from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own innocence, and the a&s;&s;urance of a future and eternal reward.</P>
<P>One day, as they were walking in a wood near the ca&s;tle, Edmund a&s;ked the father, what meant tho&s;e preparations for building, the cut|ting down tree, and burning of bricks?&mdash;What, &s;aid O&s;wald, have you not heard that my Lord is going to build a new apartment on the we&s;t &s;ide of the ca&s;tle?&mdash;And why, &s;aid Edmund, &s;hould my Lord be at that ex|pence when there is one on the ea&s;t &s;ide that is never occupied?&mdash;That apartment, &s;aid the friar, you mu&s;t have ob&s;erved is always &s;hut up.&mdash;I have ob&s;erved it often, &s;aid Edmund, but never pre&s;umed to a&s;k any que&s;tions about it.&mdash;You had then, &s;aid O&s;wald, le&s;s curio&s;ity, and more di&s;cretion, than is common at your

<P>You mu&s;t know, that apartment was occu|pied by the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t Lord Lovel when he was a ba|chelor.

She fainted away at the relation; but, when &s;he revived, exerted the utmo&s;t re&s;olution; &s;aying, it was her duty to bear this dreadful &s;troke with chri&s;tian fortitude and patience, e&s;pecially in regard to the child &s;he went with, the la&s;t remains of her beloved hu&s;band, and the undoubted heir of a noble hou&s;e. For &s;e|veral days &s;he &s;eemed an example of patience and re&s;ignation; but then, all at once, &s;he re|nounced them, and broke out into pa&s;&s;ionate and frantic exclamations; &s;he &s;aid that her dear Lord was ba&s;ely murdered; that his gho&s;t had appeared to her, and revealed his fate: She called upon Heaven and earth to revenge her wrongs; &s;aying, &s;he would never cea&s;e complaining to God, and the King, for vengeance and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Upon this, Sir Walter told the &s;ervants that Lady Lovel was di&s;tracted, from grief for the death of her lord; that his regard for her was as &s;trong as ever; and that, if &s;he recovered, he would him&s;elf be her comforter, and marry her. In the mean time &s;he was confined in this very apartment, and in le&s;s than a month the poor Lady died. She lies buried in the family vault in St. Au&s;tin's church in the vil|lage. Sir Walter took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Ca&s;tle, and all the other e&s;tates, and a&s;&s;umed the title of Lord Lovel.</P>
<P>Soon after, it was reported that the Ca&s;tle was haunted, and that the gho&s;ts of Lord and Lady Lovel had been &s;een by &s;everal of the

Whoever went into this apartment were terrified by uncommon noi&s;es, and &s;trange appearances; at length this apartment was wholly &s;hut up, and the &s;ervants were forbid to enter it, or to talk of any thing re|lating to it: However, the &s;tory did not &s;top here; it was whi&s;pered about, that the new Lord Lovel was &s;o di&s;turbed every night, that he could not &s;leep in quiet; and, being at la&s;t tired of the place, he &s;old the Ca&s;tle and e&s;tate of his ance&s;tors, to his brother-in-law the Lord Fitz-Owen, who now enjoys it, and left this country.</P>

They &s;aw their de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> were laid open; and, judging of him by them|&s;elves, thought it impo&s;&s;ible to forgive or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e forgiven. The Baron ordered them to keep in &s;eparate apartments; he took his elde&s;t &s;on for his own companion, as being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> mo&s;t rea&s;onable of the malecontents, and ordered his kin&s;men to keep their own apartment with a &s;ervant to watch their motions. Mr. William had O&s;wald for his companion. Old Jo&s;eph was bid to attend on Edmund; to &s;erve him at &s;upper; and, at the hour of nine, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|conduct him to the haunted apartment.

The Baron thought his re|que&s;t rea&s;onable, and complied with it.</P>
<P>There was a great &s;earch to find the key of the apartment; at la&s;t it was di&s;covered by
<PB N="52" REF="032742_0051_0FF50B2282EF4050">
Edmund him&s;elf, among a parcel of old ru&s;ty keys in a lumber-room. The Baron &s;ent the young men their &s;uppers to their re&s;pective a|partments. Edmund declined eating, and de|&s;ired to be conducted to his apartment. He was accompanied by mo&s;t of the &s;ervants to the door of it; they wi&s;hed him &s;ucce&s;s, and prayed for him as if he had been going to ex|ecution.</P>
<P>The door was with great difficulty unlock|ed, and Jo&s;eph gave Edmund a lighted lamp, and wi&s;hed him a good night; he returned his good wi&s;hes to them all with the utmo&s;t cheerfulne&s;s, took the key on the in&s;ide of the door, and then di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them.</P>
<P>He then took a &s;urvey of his chamber; the furniture, by long neglect, was decayed and dropping to pieces; the bed was devoured by the moths, and occupied by rats, who had built their n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ts there with impunity for ma|ny generations. The bedding was damp, for the rain had forced its way thro' the ceiling; he determined therefore to lie down in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oaths. There were two doors on the fur|ther &s;ide of the room, with keys in them: being not at all &s;leepy, he re&s;olved to examine them; he attempted one lock, and opened it with ea&s;e; he went into a large dining-room, the furniture of which was in the &s;ame <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> condition; out of this was a large <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with books in it, and hung round with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of arms, with genealogies and alliances of the

<P>He recollected the other door, and re&s;olved to &s;ee where it led to; the key was ru&s;ted in|to the lock, and re&s;i&s;ted his attempts; he &s;et the lamp on the ground, and exerting all his &s;trength, opened the door, and at the &s;ame in|&s;tant the wind of it blew out the lamp, and le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t him in utter darkne&s;s. At the &s;ame mo|ment he heard a hollow ru&s;tling noi&s;e, like that of a per&s;on coming through a narrow pa&s;|&s;age. Till this moment not one idea of fear had approached the mind of Edmund; but ju&s;t then, all the concurrent circum&s;tances or his &s;ituation &s;truck upon his heart, and gave him a new and di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation. He pau&s;ed a while; and recollecting him&s;elf, cri|ed out aloud&mdash;What &s;hould I fear? I have not wilfully offended God or man! Why then &s;hould I doubt protection? But I have not yet implored the divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance; how then can I expect it? Upon this, he kneeled down and prayed earne&s;tly, re&s;igning him&s;elf wholly to the will of heaven; while he was yet &s;peaking his courage returned, and he re&s;umed his u|&s;ual confidence; again he approached the door from whence the noi&s;e proceeded; he thought he &s;aw a glimmering light upon a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> before him.

He was preparing to de&s;cend the &s;tairca&s;e when he heard &s;everal knocks at the door by which he fir&s;t entered the room; and &s;tepping backward, the door was clapped to with great violence.

<P>Jo&s;eph withdrew, and Edmund returned to the other door, and attempted &s;everal times to open it in vain; his hands were benumbed and tired; at length he gave over.

I want to think of &s;ome way to prefer you, that you may leave this hou&s;e with honour; and I de&s;ire both of you to give me your advice in this matter.

While they were &s;peaking, O&s;wald came to them, and &s;aid, that the young men had ab&s;o|lutely refu&s;ed to dine at the table, if Ed|mund was pre&s;ent.&mdash;'Tis well, &s;aid the Ba|ron; I &s;hall find a way to puni&s;h their con|tumacy hereafter: I will make them know that I am the ma&s;ter here.

<P>He then took O&s;wald a&s;ide, and charged him not to let Edmund go out of his &s;ight; for if he &s;hould come in the way of tho&s;e im|placable enemies, he trembled for the con&s;e|quences. He then walked back to the &s;ta|bles, and the two friends returned into the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>They had a long conver&s;ation on various &s;ubjects; in the cour&s;e of it, Edmund ac|quainted O&s;wald with all that had pa&s;&s;ed be|tween him and Jo&s;eph the preceding night, the curio&s;ity he had rai&s;ed in him, and his promi&s;e to gratify it the night following.

in &s;olemn expectation, the event of the ap|proaching night.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, Mr. William was allowed to vi&s;it his friend: An affecting interview pa&s;|&s;ed between them: he lamented the nece&s;&s;ity of Edmund's departure, and they took a &s;o|lemn leave of each other, as if they foreboded it would be long ere they &s;hould meet again.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame hour as the preceding even|ing, Jo&s;eph came to conduct Edmund to his a|partment. You will find better accommoda|tions than you had la&s;t night, &s;aid he, and all by my Lord's own order.&mdash;I every hour re|ceive &s;ome new proof of his goodne&s;s, &s;aid Edmund. When they arrived, he found a good fire in the chamber, and a table covered with cold meats, and a flagon of &s;trong beer.&mdash;Sit down and get your &s;upper, my dear ma&s;ter, &s;aid Jo&s;eph: I mu&s;t attend my Lord; but as &s;oon as the family are gone to bed, I will vi&s;it you again.&mdash;Do &s;o, &s;aid Edmund; but fir&s;t, &s;ee father O&s;wald; he has &s;omething to &s;ay to you: You may tru&s;t him, for I have no re&s;erves to him.&mdash;Well, Sir, I will &s;ee him, if you de&s;ire it: and I will come to you as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, So, &s;aying, he went his way; and Edmund &s;at down to &s;upper.</P>
<P>After a moderate refre&s;hment, he kneeled down, and prayed with the greate&s;t fervency; he re&s;igned him&s;elf to the di&s;po&s;al of heaven: I am nothing, &s;aid he, I de&s;ire to be nothing but what thou, O Lord, plea&s;e&s;t to make me: If it is thy will that I &s;hould return to my for|mer

<P>Save you, my &s;on! &s;aid the friar; you look chearful and happy.&mdash;I am &s;o, father, &s;aid Ed|mund; I have re&s;igned my&s;elf to the di&s;po&s;al of Heaven, and I find my heart &s;trengthened above what I can expre&s;s.&mdash;Heaven be prai&s;|ed! &s;aid O&s;wald: I believe you are de&s;igned for great things, my &s;on.&mdash;What! do you too encourage my ambition? &s;ays Edmund; &s;trange occurrence of circum&s;tances!

<P>You have heard of the untimely death of the late Lord Lovel, my noble and worthy Ma&s;ter; perhaps you may have al&s;o heard, that, from that time, this apartment was haunted. What pa&s;&s;ed the other day, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y Lord que&s;tioned you both on this head, brought all the circum&s;tances fre&s;h into m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">

mind. You then &s;aid, there were &s;u&s;picions that he came not fairly to his end. I tru&s;t you both, and will &s;peak what I know of it. There was a per&s;on &s;u&s;pected of this murder; and who do you think it was?&mdash;You mu&s;t &s;peak out, &s;aid O&s;wald.&mdash;Why then, &s;aid Jo|&s;eph, it was the pre&s;ent Lord Lovel.&mdash;You &s;peak my thoughts, &s;aid O&s;wald; but proceed to the proofs.&mdash;I will, &s;aid Jo&s;eph. From the time that my Lord's death was reported, there were &s;trange whi&s;perings and con&s;ulations be|tween the new Lord and &s;ome of the &s;ervants; there was a deal of private bu&s;ine&s;s carried on in this apartment: Soon after, they gave out that my poor Lady was di&s;tracted; but &s;he threw out &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions that favoured no|thing of madne&s;s: &s;he &s;aid, that the gho&s;t of her departed Lord had appeared to her, and revealed the circum&s;tances of this murder. None of the &s;ervants but one, were permitted to &s;ee her. At this very time, Sir Walter, the new Lord, had the cruelty to offer love to her; he urged her to marry him; and one of her women overheard her &s;ay, &s;he would &s;ooner die than give her hand to the man who cau&s;ed the death of her Lord: &s;oon after this, we were told my Lady was dead. The Lord Lovel made a public and &s;umptuous funeral for her.&mdash;That is true, &s;aid O&s;wald; for I was a novice, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted at it.</P>
<P>Well, &s;ays Jo&s;eph, now comes my part of the &s;tory. As I was coming home from the

burial. I overtook Roger, our ploughman. Said he, What think you of this burying? What &s;hould I think, &s;aid I, but we have lo&s;t the be&s;t ma&s;ter and lady we &s;hall ever know? God he knows, quoth Roger, whether they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e living or dead; but if ever I &s;aw my lady in my life, I &s;aw her alive the night they &s;ay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he died. I tried to convince him that he was mi&s;taken<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> but he offered to take his oath, that the very night they &s;aid &s;he died, he &s;aw her come out at the garden-gate into the fields; that &s;he often &s;topped, like a per&s;on in pain, and then went forward again until he lo&s;t &s;ight of her. Now it is certain that her time was out, and &s;he expected to lie down every day: and they did not pretend that &s;he died in child-bed. I thought upon what I heard: but nothing I &s;aid. Roger told the &s;ame &s;tory to another &s;ervant: &s;o he was cal|led to an account; the &s;tory was hu&s;hed up, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d the fooli&s;h fellow &s;aid, he was verily per|&s;uaded it was her gho&s;t that he &s;aw. Now you mu&s;t take notice that, from this time, they began to talk about, that this apartment was troubled; and not only this, but at la&s;t the new Lord could not &s;leep in quiet in his own room; and this induced him to &s;ell the ca&s;tle to his brother-in-law, and g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t out of this country as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible.

<P>At the&s;e words Edmund changed colour, and trembled; he clapped his hand upon his brea&s;t and looked up to Heaven in &s;ilence; his dream occurred to his memory, and &s;truck upon his heart.

<P>Here a &s;ilence of &s;everal minutes en&s;ued when, &s;uddenly, they were awakened from their reverie by a violent noi&s;e in the rooms underneath them. It &s;eemed like the cla&s;h|ing of arms, and &s;omething &s;eemed to fall down with violence.</P>

<P>The lower rooms an&s;wered exactly to tho&s;e above; there were two parlours and a large clo&s;et. They &s;aw nothing remarkable in the&s;e rooms, except two pictures, that were turned with their faces to the wall. Jo&s;eph took the courage to turn them: The&s;e, &s;aid he, are the portraits of my Lord and Lady.&mdash;Father, look at this face; do you know who is like it?&mdash;I &s;hould think, &s;aid O&s;wald, it was done for Edmund!&mdash;I am, &s;aid Edmund, &s;truck with the re&s;emblance my&s;elf: but let us go on: I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ell my&s;elf in&s;pired with unu&s;ual courage.&mdash;Let us open the clo&s;et-door.&mdash;O&s;wald &s;topped him &s;hort:&mdash;Take heed, &s;aid he, le&s;t the wind of the door put out the lamp. I will o|pen this door. He attempted it without &s;ucce&s;s; Jo&s;eph did the &s;ame, but to no pur|po&s;e: Edmund gave the lamp to Jo&s;eph; he approached the door, tried the key, and it gave way to his hand in a moment.&mdash;This adventure belongs, &s;aid he, to me only; that is plain; bring the lamp forward. O&s;|wald repeated his paterno&s;ter, in which they all joined, and then entered the clo&s;et.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing that pre&s;ented it&s;elf to their view, was a complete &s;uit of armour, that &s;eemed to have fallen down on an heap.

You &s;ee, cou&s;in Jack, &s;aid Wenlock, how this villain has &s;tole the hearts of my uncle's &s;ervants: I &s;uppo&s;e this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> old fellow knows where he is, if the truth were known.&mdash;Have you any fur|ther commands for me, Gentlemen? &s;aid the old man.&mdash;No, not we.&mdash;Then I am order|ed to attend my Lord, when you have done with me.&mdash;Go, then, about your bu&s;ine&s;s. Jo&s;eph went away, glad to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>What &s;hall we do, &s;aid Wenlock, to pa&s;s a|way the time? It is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y dull &s;itting here.&mdash;

Doll enough, &s;aid Markham; I think the be&s;t thing we can do, is to go to bed, and &s;leep it away.&mdash;Faith, &s;ays Wenlock, I am in no di&s;|po&s;ition to &s;leep! Who would have thought the old man would have obliged us to &s;pend the night here?&mdash;Don't &s;ay <HI>us.</HI> I beg of you; it was all your own doing, replied Markham.&mdash;I did not intend he &s;hould have taken me at my word.&mdash;Then you &s;hould have &s;poken more cautiou&s;ly. I have always been govern|ed by you, like a fool as I am; you play the braggart, and I &s;uffer for it: But they begin to &s;ee through your fine-&s;pun arts and contri|vances, and I believe you will meet with your de&s;erts one day or other.&mdash;What now? do you mean to affront me, Jack? Know, that &s;ome are born to plan, others to execute; I am one of the former, thou of the latter: Know your friend, or&mdash;Or what? replied Markham; do you mean to threaten me? If you do!&mdash;What then? &s;aid Wenlock.&mdash;Why, then, I will try which of us two is the be&s;t man, Sir! Upon this Markham aro&s;e, and put him&s;elf into a po&s;ture of defence. Wenlock perceiving he was &s;erious in h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s an|ger, began to &s;ooth him; he per&s;uaded, he flattered, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">ed great things, if he would be compo&s;ed. Markham was &s;ullen, unea&s;y re&s;entful; whenever he &s;poke, it was to up|braid Wenlock with his treachery and fal&s;e|hood. Wenlock tried all his eloquence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o get him into a good humour, but in vain; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> threatened to acquaint his Uncle with all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

he knew, and to exculpate him&s;elf at the o|ther's expence. Wenlock began to find his choler ri&s;e; they were both almo&s;t choaked with rage; and at length, they both ro&s;e with a re&s;olution to fight.</P>
<P>As they &s;tood with their fi&s;ts clenched, on a &s;udden they were alarmed with a di&s;mal groan from the room underneath. They &s;tood like &s;tatues, petrified by fear, yet li&s;t|ening with trembling expectation: A &s;econd groan increa&s;ed their con&s;ternation; and, &s;oon after, a third compleated it. They &s;tag|gered to a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eat, and &s;unk down upon it, ready to faint; pre&s;ently, all the doors flew open, a pale glimmering light appeared at the door, from the &s;tairca&s;e, and a man in compleat ar|mour entered the room; he &s;tood with one hand extended, pointing to the outward door; they took the hint, and crawled away as fa&s;t as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ear would let them; they &s;taggered along the gallery, and from thence to the Baron's apartment, where Wenlock &s;unk down in a &s;woon, and Markham had ju&s;t &s;trength e|nough to knock at the door.</P>
<P>The &s;ervant who &s;lept in the outward room, alarmed his Lord; Markham cried out&mdash;For Heaven's &s;ake, let us in! Upon hearing his voice, the door was opened, and Mark|ham approached his Uncle in &s;uch an attitude of fear, as excited a degree of it in the Baron. He pointed to Wenlock, who was with &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">culty recovered from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e had fallen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; the &s;ervant was terrified, he rung the

alarm bell; the &s;ervants came running from all parts to their Lord's apartment: The young Gentlemen came likewi&s;e, and pre|&s;ently all was confu&s;ion, and the terror was univer&s;al. O&s;wald, who gue&s;&s;ed the bu&s;ine&s;s, was the only one that could que&s;tion them; he a&s;ked &s;everal times.&mdash;What is the matter? Markham, at la&s;t an&s;wered him.&mdash;We have &s;een the gho&s;t!&mdash;All regard to &s;ecrecy was now at an end; the echo ran through the whole family.&mdash;They have &s;een the gho&s;t!</P>
<P>The Baron de&s;ired O&s;wald to talk to the young men, and endeavour to quiet the di&s;|turbance. He came forward; he comforted &s;ome, he rebuked others; he bade the &s;ervants retire into the outward room: The Baron, with his &s;ons and kin&s;men, remained in the bed-chamber.&mdash;It is very unfortunate, &s;aid O&s;wald, that this affair &s;hould be made &s;o public; &s;urely the&s;e young men might have related what they had &s;een, without alarming the whole family: I am very much concern|ed upon my Lord's account.&mdash;I thank you, father, &s;aid the Baron; but prudence was quite overthrown here: Wenlock was half dead, and Markham half di&s;tracted; the fa|mily were alarmed without my being able to prevent it: But let us hear what tho&s;e poor terrified creatures &s;ay. O&s;wald demand|ed.&mdash;What have you &s;een, Gentlemen&mdash;The gho&s;t! &s;aid Markham.&mdash;In wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> form did it appear?&mdash;A man in armo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> Did it &s;peak to you?&mdash;No.&mdash;What did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

to terrify you &s;o much?&mdash;It &s;tood at the far|the&s;t door, and pointed to the outward door, as if to have us leave the room; we did not wait for a &s;econd notice, but came away as fa&s;t as we could.&mdash;Did it follow you?&mdash;No.&mdash;Then you need not have rai&s;ed &s;uch a di&s;turbance. Wenlock lifted up his head, and &s;poke:&mdash;I believe, father, if you had been with us, you would not have &s;tood upon ceremonies any more than we did. I wi&s;h my Lord would &s;end you to parley with the gho&s;t; for without doubt, you are better qualified than we.&mdash;My Lord, &s;aid O&s;wald, I will go thither, with your permi&s;&s;ion: I will &s;ee that every thing is &s;afe, and bring the key back to you: Perhaps this may help to di&s;pel the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ears that have been rai&s;ed, at lea&s;t I will try to do it.&mdash;I thank you, father, for your good offices; do as you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>O&s;wald went into the outward room. I am going, &s;aid he, to &s;hut up the apartment: The young gentlemen have been more fright|ened than they had occa&s;ion for; I will try to account for it. Which of you will go with me? They all drew back, except Jo&s;eph, who offered to bear him company. They went into the bed-room in the haunted apartment, and found every thing quiet there. They put out the fire, extingui&s;hed the lights, locked the door, and brought away the key. As they returned&mdash;I thought how it would be, &s;aid Jo&s;eph.&mdash;Hu&s;h! not a word, &s;aid O&s;wald; you find we are &s;u&s;pected of &s;omething, though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> know not what.

<P>All is quiet in the apartment, &s;aid O&s;wald, as we can te&s;tify.&mdash;Did you a&s;k Jo&s;eph to go with you, &s;aid the Baron, or did he offer him|&s;elf?&mdash;My Lord, I a&s;ked if any body would go with me, and they all declined it but he: I thought proper to have a witne&s;s be&s;ide my|&s;elf, for whatever might be &s;een or heard.&mdash;Jo&s;eph, you was &s;ervant of the late Lord Lovel, what kind of a man was he?&mdash;A very comely man, plea&s;e your Lord&s;hip.

He called the &s;ervants in: let no|thing be mentioned out of doors, &s;aid he, of what has lately pa&s;&s;ed within, e&s;pecially in the ea&s;t apartment; the young Gentlemen had not &s;o much rea&s;on to be frightened as they apprehended; a piece of furniture fell down in the rooms underneath, which made the noi&s;e that alarmed them &s;o much; but I can certify that all things in the rooms are in qui|et, and there is nothing to fear. All of you attend me in the chapel in an hour; do your duties, put your tru&s;t in God, and obey your Lord, and you will find every thing go right as it u&s;ed to do.</P>

They di&s;per&s;ed; the &s;un ro&s;e, the day came on, and every thing went on in the u&s;ual cour&s;e: but the &s;ervants were not &s;o ea&s;ily &s;a|tisfied; they whi&s;pered that &s;omething was wrong, and expected the time that &s;hould &s;et all right.&mdash;The mind of the Baron was em|ployed in meditating upon th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e circum&s;tan|ces, that &s;eemed to him the fore-runners of &s;ome great events: he &s;ometimes thought of Edmund; he &s;ighed for his expul&s;ion, and lamented the uncertainty of his fate: but, to his family, he appeared ea&s;y and &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>From the time of Edmund's departure, the fair Emma had many unea&s;y hours; &s;he wi&s;h|ed to inquire after him, but feared to &s;hew any &s;olicitude concerning him: The next day, when her brother William came into her a|partment, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he took courage to a&s;k him a que&s;|tion.&mdash;Pray brother, can you give any gue&s;s what is become of Edmund?&mdash;No, &s;aid he (with a &s;igh;) why do you a&s;k me?&mdash;Becau&s;e, my dear William, I &s;hould think if any body knew, it mu&s;t be you; and I thought he lov|ed you too well to leave you in ignorance; but don't you think he left the Ca&s;tle in a ve|ry &s;trange manner<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&mdash;I do, my dear; there is a my&s;tery in every circum&s;tance of his de|parture; neverthele&s;s (I will tru&s;t you with a &s;ecret) he did not leave the Ca&s;tle without making a di&s;tinction in my favour.&mdash;I thought &s;o, &s;aid &s;he; but you might tell me what you know about him.&mdash;Alas! my dear Emma I know nothing: When I &s;aw him la&s;t, he

he al&s;o di&s;covered that John loved his ma&s;ter, and re&s;pected him even to veneration; from him he learned many particulars con|cerning that worthy Knight.

<P>He &s;ent Wyatt before, to notify his arrival to Sir Philip, while he waited at the gate full of doubts and anxieties concerning his recep|tion.

<P>John made ha&s;te to deliver his me&s;&s;age, and Edmund followed him in &s;ilence into Sir Phi|lip's pre&s;ence: He bowed low, and kept at a

<P>When Sir Philip had &s;eated his young friend, he li&s;tened in &s;ilence to the &s;urpri&s;ing tale he had to tell him. Edmund told him briefly the mo&s;t remarkable circum&s;tances of his life, from the time when he &s;aw and liked him, till his return from France: but from that aera, he related at large every thing that happened, recounting every intere&s;ting particular, which was imprinted on his me|mory in &s;trong and la&s;ting characters.&mdash;Sir Philip grew every moment more affected by the recital; &s;ometimes he cla&s;ped his hands together, he lifted them up to Heaven, he &s;mote his brea&s;t, he &s;ighed, he exclaimed a|loud; when Edmund related his dream, he breathed &s;hort, and &s;eemed to devour him with attention; and when he de&s;cribed the fatal clo&s;et, he trembled, &s;ighed, &s;obbed, and was almo&s;t &s;uffocated with his agitations: But when he related all that pa&s;&s;ed between

his &s;uppo&s;ed mother and him&s;elf, and finally produced the jewels, the proofs of his birth, and the death of his unfortunate mother&mdash;he flew to him, he pre&s;&s;ed him to his bo&s;om, he &s;trove to &s;peak, but &s;peech was for &s;ome mi|nutes denied: He wept aloud; and, at length, his words found their way in broken excla|mations&mdash;Son of my deare&s;t friend! dear and precious relic of a noble hou&s;e! child of Provi|dence!&mdash;the beloved of Heaven!&mdash;welcome! thrice welcome to my arms!&mdash;to my heart! I will be thy parent from henceforward, and thou &s;halt be indeed my child, my heir! My mind told me from the fir&s;t moment I beheld thee, that thou wert the image of my friend! my heart then opened it&s;elf to receive thee, as his offspring. I had a &s;trange foreboding that I was to be thy protector. I would then have made thee my own; but Heaven orders things for the be&s;t; it made thee the in&s;tru|ment of this di&s;covery, and in its own time and manner conducted thee to my arms. Prai&s;e be to God for his wonderful doings to|wards the children of men! every thing that has befallen thee is by his direction, and he will not leave his work unfini&s;hed; I tru&s;t I &s;hall be his in&s;trument to do ju&s;tice on the guilty, and to re&s;tore the orphan of my friend to his rights and title. I devote my&s;elf to this &s;ervice, and will make it the bu&s;ine&s;s of my life to effect it.</P>
<P>Edmund gave vent to his emotions, in rap|tures of joy and gratitude. They &s;pent &s;eve|ral

hours in this way, without thinking of the time that pa&s;&s;ed; the one inquiring, the other explaining and repeating, every particular of the intere&s;ting &s;tory.</P>
<P>At length they were interrupted by the careful John Wyatt, who was anxious to know if any thing was likely to give trouble to his Ma&s;ter.&mdash;Sir, &s;aid John, it grows dark, do you want a light?&mdash;We want no light but what Heaven gives us, &s;aid Sir Philip; I hope your Honour has heard no bad tidings,&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;I hope no offence.&mdash;None at all, &s;aid the good Knight; I am obliged to your &s;olici|tude for me: I have heard &s;ome things that grieve me, and others that give me plea&s;ure; but the &s;orrows are pa&s;t, and the joys remain.&mdash;Thank God! &s;aid John; I was afraid &s;ome|thing was the matter to give your Honour trouble.&mdash;I thank you, my good &s;ervant!

But, John, when you know him better, you will re&s;pect him &s;till more; at pre&s;ent, I &s;hall only tell you what he is not, for you think him only the &s;on of Andrew Twyford.&mdash;And is he not, &s;aid John?&mdash;No, but his wife nur|&s;ed him, and he pa&s;&s;ed for her &s;on.&mdash;And does old Twyford know it, Sir?&mdash;He does, and will bear witne&s;s to it: but he is the &s;on of a near friend of mine, of quality &s;uperior to my own, and as &s;uch you mu&s;t &s;erve and re&s;pect him.&mdash;I &s;hall, to be &s;ure, Sir; but what name &s;hall I call him?&mdash;You &s;hall know that hereafter; in the mean time bring a light, and wait on us to the other parlour.</P>
<P>When John was withdrawn, Sir Philip &s;aid, that is a point to be determined and con&s;ider|ed immediately: It is proper that you &s;hould a&s;&s;ume a name till you can take that of your father; for I choo&s;e you &s;hould drop that of your fo&s;ter father; and I would have you be called by one that is re&s;pectable.&mdash;In that, and

every other point, I will be wholly governed by you, Sir, &s;aid Edmund.&mdash;Well then, I will give you the name of Seagrave: I &s;hall &s;ay that you are a relation of my own; and my mother was really of that family.</P>
<P>John &s;oon returned, and attended them in|to the other parlour: Sir Philip entered with Edmund in his hand.&mdash;My friends, &s;aid he, this gentleman is Mr. Edward Seagrave, the &s;on of a dear friend and relation of mine: he was lo&s;t in his infancy, brought up out of pure humanity, and is but lately re&s;tored to his own family: The circum&s;tances &s;hall be known hereafter: In the mean time, I have taken him under my care and protection, and will u&s;e all my power and intere&s;t to &s;ee him re&s;tored to his fortune, which is enjoyed by the u&s;urper who was the cau&s;e of his expul|&s;ion, and the death of his parents. Receive him as my relation and friend: Zadi&s;ky, do you embrace him fir&s;t. Edmund, you and this gentleman mu&s;t love each other for my &s;ake; hereafter you will do it for your own. They all ro&s;e, each embraced and congratu|lated the young man. Zadi&s;ky &s;aid, Sir, whatever griefs and misfortunes you may have endured, you may reckon them at an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nd, from the hour you are beloved and protected by Sir Philip Harclay.&mdash;I firmly believe it, Sir, replied Edmund: and my heart enjoys, already, more happine&s;s than I ever ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> felt, and promi&s;es me all that I can wi&s;h in future:

his friend&s;hip is the earne&s;t Heaven gives me of its ble&s;&s;ings hereafter.</P>
<P>They &s;at down to &s;upper with mutual chear|fulne&s;s; and Edmund enjoyed the repa&s;t with more &s;ati&s;faction than he had felt a long time. Sir Philip &s;aw his countenance brighten up, and looked on him with heart-felt plea&s;ure.&mdash;Every time I look on you, &s;aid he, re|minds me of your father; you are the &s;ame per&s;on I loved twenty-three years ago: I re|joice to &s;ee you under my roof. Go to your repo&s;e early, and to-morrow we will con&s;ult farther. Edmund withdrew, and enjoyed a night of &s;weet undi&s;turbed repo&s;e.</P>
<P>The next morning, Edmund aro&s;e in perfect health and &s;pirits; he waited on his benefac|tor. They were &s;oon after joined by Zadi&s;ky, who &s;hewed great attention and re&s;pect to the youth, and offered him his be&s;t &s;ervices with|out re&s;erve. Edmund accepted them with equal re&s;pect and mode&s;ty? and finding him|&s;elf at ea&s;e, began to di&s;play his amiable qua|lities. They breakfa&s;ted together; afterwards Sir Philip de&s;ired Edmund to walk out with him.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they were out of hearing, Sir Phi|lip &s;aid,&mdash;I could not &s;leep la&s;t night for think|ing of your affairs; I laid &s;chemes for you, and rejected them again. We mu&s;t lay our plan before we begin to act. What mu&s;t be done to this treacherous kin&s;man! this inhuman mon&s;ter! this a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in of his neare&s;t relation?

I will ri&s;k my life and fortune to bring him to ju&s;tice. Shall I go to court and demand ju&s;|tice of the King? or &s;hall I accu&s;e him of the murder, and make him &s;tand a public trial? If I treat him as a Baron of the realm, he mu&s;t be tried by his Peers; if as a common|er, he mu&s;t be tried at the county a&s;&s;ize: but we mu&s;t &s;hew the rea&s;on why he &s;hould be de|graded from his title.

That is a generous and grateful con&s;ideration on your part; but you owe &s;till more to the memory of your injured parents. However, there is yet another way &s;uits me better than any hitherto propo&s;ed: I will challenge the traitor to meet me in the field; and, if he has &s;pirit enough to an&s;wer my call, I will there bring him to ju&s;tice, if not, I will bring him to a public trial.</P>
<P>No, Sir, &s;aid Edmund, that is my province. Should I &s;tand by and &s;ee my noble, gallant friend expo&s;e his life for me, I &s;hould be un|worthy to bear the name of that friend whom you &s;o much lament. It would become his &s;on to vindicate his name, and revenge his death. I will be the challenger, and no other.&mdash;And do you think he will an&s;wer the chal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|enge of an unknown youth, with nothing but

Leave this matter to me; I'll think of a way that will oblige him to meet me at the hou&s;e of a third per&s;on, who is known to all the parties concerned, and where we will have authentic witne&s;&s;es of all that pa&s;&s;es be|tween him and me. I will devi&s;e the time, place, and manner, and &s;atisfy all your &s;cru|ples. Edmund offered to reply; but Sir Phi|lip bade him be &s;ilent, and let him proceed his own way.</P>
<P>He then led him over his e&s;tate, and &s;hew|ed him every thing de&s;erving his notice: he told him all the particulars of his dome&s;tic oe|conomy; and they returned home in time to meet their friends at dinner.</P>
<P>They &s;pent &s;everal days in con&s;ulting how to bring Sir Walter to account, and in im|proving their friend&s;hip and confidence in each other. Edmund endeared him&s;elf &s;o much to his friend and patron, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> declar|ed him his adopted &s;on and heir before all his friends and &s;ervants, and ordered them to re|&s;pect him as &s;uch.

<P>After much con&s;ideration, Sir Philip fixed his re&s;olutions, and began to execute his pur|po&s;es. He &s;et out for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eat of the Lord Clifford, attended by Edmund, M. Zadi&s;ky, and two &s;ervants.

<P><PB N="124" REF="032742_0123_0FF50B7035786E48">
Sir Philip pre&s;ented Edmund to Lord Clif|ford and his family, as his near relation and pre&s;umptive heir: they &s;pent their evening in the plea&s;ures of convivial mirth and ho&s;pitable entertainment. The next day Sir Philip be|gan to open his mind to Lord Clifford, in|forming him that both his young friend and him&s;elf had received great injuries from the pre&s;ent Lord Lovel, for which they were re|&s;olved to call him to an account; but that, for many rea&s;ons, they were de&s;irous to have proper witne&s;&s;es of all that &s;hould pa&s;s between them, and begging the favour of his Lord&s;hip to be the principal one.

<P>Zadi&s;ky pre&s;ented the letter to the Lord Lo|vel, informing him that he was the friend of Sir Philip Harclay. He &s;eemed &s;urpri&s;ed and confounded at the contents; but, putting on an haughty air; I know nothing, &s;aid he, of the bu&s;ine&s;s this letter hints at: but wait a few hours, and I will give you an an&s;wer. He gave orders to treat Zadi&s;ky like a gentleman, in every re&s;pect, except in avoiding his com|pany: for the Greek had a &s;hrewd and pene|trating a&s;pect, and he ob&s;erved every turn of his countenance.

</LETTER>
<P>'Tis well, &s;aid Sir Philip: I am glad to find <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e has the &s;pirit to meet me; he is an e|nemy worthy of my &s;word. Lord Clifford then propo&s;ed, that all parties &s;hould pa&s;s the borders, and obtain leave of the warden of the Scotti&s;h marches to decide the quarrel in his juri&s;diction, with a &s;elect number of friends on both &s;ides. Sir Philip agreed to the propo&s;al; and Lord Clifford wrote in his own name to a&s;k permi&s;&s;ion of Lord Graham, that his friends might come there; and ob|tained it, on condition that neither party, &s;hould exceed a limited number of friends and followers.</P>
<P>Lord Clifford &s;ent cho&s;en me&s;&s;engers to Lord Lovel, acquainting him with the condi|tions, and appointing the time place, and man|ner of their meeting, and that he had been de&s;ired to accept the office of judge of the

<P>In the interim, Sir Philip Harclay thought proper to &s;ettle his worldly affairs: he made Zadi&s;ky acquainted with every circum&s;tance of Edmund's hi&s;tory, and the obligation that lay upon him to revenge the death of his friend, and &s;ee ju&s;tice done to his heir. Zadi&s;ky en|tered in the cau&s;e with an ardour that &s;poke the affection he bore to his friend. Why, &s;aid he, would you not &s;uffer me to engage this traitor?&mdash;Your life is of too much con&s;e|quence to be &s;taked again&s;t his: but though I tru&s;t that the ju&s;tice of your cau&s;e mu&s;t &s;ucceed, yet, if it &s;hould happen otherwi&s;e, I vow to re|venge you; he &s;hall never go back from us both: However, my hope and tru&s;t is to &s;ee your arm the mini&s;ter of ju&s;tice. Sir Philip then &s;ent for a lawyer, and made his will, by which he appointed Edmund his chief heir, by the name of Lovel, alias Seagrave, alias Twyford; he ordered that all his old friends, &s;oldiers, and &s;ervants, &s;hould be maintained in the &s;ame manner during their lives; he left to Zadi&s;ky an annuity of an hundred a year, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> legacy of two hundred pounds; one hundred pounds to a certain mona&s;try; the &s;ame to be di&s;tributed among di&s;banded &s;oldiers, and the

<P>He appointed Lord Clifford joint executor with Edmund, and gave his will into that noble|man's care, recommending Edmund to his fa|vour and protection. If I live, &s;aid he, I will make him appear to be worthy of it; if I die, he will want a friend. I am de&s;irous your Lord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hip, as a judge of the field, &s;hould be unprejudiced on either &s;ide, that you may judge impartially. If I die, Edmund's preten|&s;ions die with me; but my friend Zadi&s;ky will acquaint you with the foundation of them. I take the&s;e precautions, becau&s;e I ought to be prepared for every thing: but my heart is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with better hopes, and I tru&s;t I &s;hall live to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> my own cau&s;e, as well as that of my friend, who is a per&s;on of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">re con&s;equence than he appears to be.

<P>While the&s;e preparations were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">aking for the great event that was to decide the preten|&s;ions of Edmund, his enemies, at the Ca&s;tle of Lovel, were brought to &s;hame for their beha|viour to him.</P>
<P>The di&s;agreement between Wenlock and Markham had by degrees broug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> on an ex|planation of &s;ome part<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of their conduct. Father O&s;wald had often hinted to the Baron, Wenlock's envy of Edmund's &s;uperior quali|ties, and the artifices by which he had obtain|ed &s;uch an influence with Sir Robert, as to
<PB N="129" REF="032742_0128_0FF4D44D5825ABD0">
make him take his part upon all occa&s;ions. O&s;wald now took advantage of the breach be|tween the&s;e two incendiaries, to per&s;uade Markham to ju&s;tify him&s;elf at Wenlock's ex|pence, and to tell all he knew of his wicked|ne&s;s: at length he promi&s;ed to declare all he knew of Wenlock's conduct, as well in France as &s;ince their return, when he &s;hould be cal|led upon: and, by him, O&s;wald was enabled to unravel the whole of his contrivances a|gain&s;t the honour, intere&s;t, and even life of Edmund.</P>
<P>He prevailed on Hew&s;on, and Kemp, his a&s;|&s;ociate, to add their te&s;timony to the others. Hew&s;on confe&s;&s;ed that he was touched in his con&s;cience, when he reflected on the cruelty and inju&s;tice of his behaviour to Edmund, who&s;e behaviour towards him, after he had laid a &s;nare for his life, was &s;o noble and gene|rous, that he was cut to the heart by it, and had &s;uffered &s;o much pain and remor&s;e, that he longed for nothing &s;o much as an opportuni|ty to unburthen his mind; but the dread of Mr. Wenlock's anger, and the effects of his re&s;entment, had hitherto kept him &s;ilent, al|ways hoping there would come a time, when he might have leave to declare the whole truth.</P>
<P>O&s;wald conveyed this information to the Baron's ear, who waited for an opportunity to make the proper u&s;e of it. Not long after, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> two principal incendiaries came to an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> rupture, and Markham threatened Wen|lock
<PB N="130" REF="032742_0129_0FF50BFB4FE2E118">
that he would &s;hew his uncle what a &s;er|pent he had harboured in his bo&s;om. The Baron arre&s;ted his words, and in&s;i&s;ted upon his telling all he knew; adding, if you &s;peak the truth, I will &s;upport you; but if you prove fal&s;e, I will puni&s;h you &s;everely: As to Mr. Wenlock, he &s;hall have a fair trial; and if all the accu&s;ations I have heard are made good, it is high time I &s;hould put him out of my fa|mily. The Baron with a &s;tern a&s;pect, bade them follow him into the great hall; and &s;ent for all the re&s;t of the family together.</P>
<P>He then, with great &s;olemnity, told them he was ready to hear all &s;ides of the que&s;tion. He declared the whole &s;ub&s;tance of his infor|mations, and called upon the accu&s;ers to &s;up|port the charge.

<P>The Baron ordered two of his &s;ervants to pack up Wenlock's clothes and nece&s;&s;aries, and to &s;et out with him that very day; he bade &s;ome others keep an eye upon him lea&s;t he &s;hould e&s;cape: As &s;oon as they were ready, my Lord wi&s;hed him a good journey, and gave him a letter for his mother. He departed, without &s;aying a word, in a &s;ullen kind of re&s;entment; but his countenance &s;hewed the inward agita|tions of his mind.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he was gone, every mouth was opened again&s;t him; a thou&s;and &s;tories came out that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ever heard before: The Baron and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> were a&s;toni&s;hed that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> go <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> long without detection.

and ardently wi&s;hed to know what was become of him.</P>
<P>Sir Robert took the opportunity of coming to an explanation with his brother William; he took &s;hame to him&s;elf for &s;ome part of his pa&s;t behaviour. Mr. William owned his af|fection to Edmund, and ju&s;tified it by his merit and attachment to him, which were &s;uch, that he was certain no time or di&s;tance could after them. He accepted his brother's acknow|ledgement, as a full amends for all that had pa&s;&s;ed, and begged that henceforward an en|tire love and confidence might &s;ub&s;i&s;t between them. The&s;e new regulations re&s;tored peace, confidence, and harmony, in the Ca&s;tle of Lovel.</P>
<P>At length, the day arrived for the comba|tants to meet. The Lord Graham, with twelve followers, gentlemen, and twelve &s;er|vants, was ready at the dawn of day to receive them.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t that entered the field was Sir Phi|lip Harclay, Knight, armed completely, ex|cepting his head-piece; Hugh Rugby, his E&s;|quire, bearing his lance; John Bernard, his page, carrying his helmet and &s;purs; and two &s;ervants in his proper livery. The next came Edmund, the heir of Lovel, followed by his &s;ervant, John Wyatt; Zadi&s;ky followed by his &s;ervant.</P>
<P>At a &s;hort di&s;tance came the Lord Clifford, as judge of the field, with his E&s;quire, two
<PB N="134" REF="032742_0133_0FF50C5C08553978">
pages, and two livery &s;ervants; followed by his elde&s;t &s;on, his nephew, and a gentleman his friend, each attended by one &s;ervant: He al&s;o brought a &s;urgeon of note, to take care of the wounded.</P>
<P>The Lord Graham &s;aluted them; and, by his order, they took their places without the li&s;ts, and the trumpet &s;ounded for the chal|lenger. It was an&s;wered by the defendant, who &s;oon after appeared, attended by three gentlemen, his friends, with each one his &s;er|vant, be&s;ide his own proper attendants.</P>
<P>A place was erected for Lord Clifford, as judge of the field; he de&s;ired Lord Graham would &s;hare the office, who accepted it, on condition that the combatants &s;hould make no objection; and they agreed to it with the greate&s;t courte&s;y and re&s;pect. They con&s;ult|ed together on many points of honour and ce|remony between the two combatants.</P>
<P>They appointed a mar&s;hal of the field, and other inferior officers, u&s;ually employed on the&s;e occa&s;ions. The Lord Graham &s;ent the mar&s;hal for the challenger, de&s;iring him to de|clare the cau&s;e of his quarrel before his ene|my. Sir Philip Harclay then advanced, and thus &s;poke:</P>
<P><Q>I, Philip Harclay, Knight, challenge Wal|ter, commonly called Lord Lovel, as a ba&s;e, treacherous, and bloody man, who, by his wicked arts and devices, did kill, or cau&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o be killed, his kin&s;man, Arthur Lord Lo|vel, my dear and noble friend. I am cal|led
<PB N="135" REF="032742_0134_0FF50C6B43116680">
upon, in an extraordinary manner, to revenge his death; and I will prove the truth of what I have affirmed at the peril of my life.</Q></P>
<P>Lord Graham then bade the defendant an|&s;wer to the charge. Lord Lovel &s;tood forth before his followers, and thus replied:</P>
<P><Q>I, Walter, Baron of Lovel, do deny the charge again&s;t me, and affirm it to be a ba&s;e, fal&s;e, and malicious accu&s;ation of this Sir Philip Harclay, which I believe to be invented of him&s;elf, or el&s;e framed by &s;ome enemy, and told to him for wicked ends; but, be that as it may, I will maintain my own honour, and prove him to be a fal&s;e traitor, at the hazard of my own life, and to the puni&s;hment of his pre&s;umption</Q></P>
<P>Then &s;aid the Lord Graham,&mdash;Will not this quarrel admit of arbitration? No, replied Sir Philip; when I have ju&s;tified this charge, I have more to bring again&s;t him. I tru&s;t in God and the ju&s;tice of my cau&s;e, and defy that traitor to then death! Lord Clifford then &s;poke a few words to Lord Graham, who immedi|ately called to the mar&s;hal, and bade him o|pen the li&s;ts, and deliver their weapons to the combatants.</P>
<P>While the mar&s;hal was arranging the com|batants and their followers, Edmund ap|proached his friend and patron; he put one knee to the ground, he embraced his knees, with the &s;tronge&s;t emotions of grief and anxie|ty. He was dre&s;&s;ed in compleat armour, with
<PB N="136" REF="032742_0135_0FF50C7BA0869578">
his vi&s;or down; his device was a hawthorn, with a graft of the ro&s;e upon it, the motto&mdash;THIS IS NOT MY TRUE PARENT; but Sir Phi|lip bade him take the&s;e words&mdash;E FRUCTU ARBOR COGNOSCITUR.</P>
<P>Sir Philip embraced the youth with &s;trong marks of affection: Be compo&s;ed, my child! &s;aid he: I have neither guilt, fear, nor doubt in me; I am &s;o certain of &s;ucce&s;s, that I bid you be prepared for the con&s;equence. Za|di&s;ky embraced his friend, he comforted Ed|mund, he &s;ugge&s;ted every thing that could confirm his hopes of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The mar&s;hal waited to deliver the &s;pear to Sir Philip; he now pre&s;ented it with the u&s;ual form.&mdash;Sir, receive your lance, and God de|fend the right!&mdash;Sir Philip an&s;wered, Amen! in a voice that was heard by all pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>He next pre&s;ented his weapon to Lord Lo|vel, with the &s;ame &s;entence, who likewi&s;e an|&s;wered, Amen! with a good courage. Im|mediately the li&s;ts were cleared, and the com|batants began the fight.</P>
<P>They contended a long time, with equal &s;kill and courage; at length, Sir Philip un|hor&s;ed his antagoni&s;t. The judges ordered, that either he &s;hould alight, or &s;uffer his ene|my to re-mount; he cho&s;e the former, and a &s;hort combat on foot en&s;ued. The &s;weat ran off their bodies with the violence of the exer|ci&s;e. Sir Philip watched every motion of his enemy, and &s;trove to weary him out, intend|ing
<PB N="137" REF="032742_0136_0FF50C8BAC3323C8">
to wound but not to kill him, unle&s;s o|bliged for his own &s;afety.</P>
<P>He thru&s;t his &s;word through his left arm, and demanded, whether he would confe&s;s the fact? Lord Lovel enraged, an&s;wered, he would die &s;ooner. Sir Philip then pa&s;&s;ed the &s;word through his body twice, and Lord Lo|vel fell, crying out that he was &s;lain.</P>
<P>I hope not, &s;aid Sir Philip, for I have a great deal of bu&s;ine&s;s for you to do before you die. Confe&s;s your &s;ins, and endeavour to atone for them, as the only ground to hope for pardon.&mdash;Lord Lovel replied, You are the victor, u&s;e your good fortune generou&s;ly!</P>
<P>Sir Philip took his &s;word, and then waved it over his head, and beckoned for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The judges &s;ent to beg Sir Philip to &s;pare the life of his enemy.&mdash;I will, &s;aid he, upon condi|tion that he will make an hone&s;t confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Lord Lovel de&s;ired a &s;urgeon and a confe&s;|&s;or.&mdash;You &s;hall have both, &s;aid Sir Philip; But you mu&s;t fir&s;t an&s;wer me a que&s;tion or two. Did you kill your kin&s;man or not?&mdash;It was not my hand that killed him, an|&s;wered the wounded man.&mdash;It was done by your own order, however? You &s;hall have no a&s;&s;i&s;tance till you an&s;wer this point.&mdash;It was, &s;aid he, and Heaven is ju&s;t!&mdash;Bear wit|ne&s;s all pre&s;ent, &s;aid Sir Philip: he confe&s;&s;es the fact!</P>
<P>He then beckoned Edmund, who approach|ed.&mdash;Take off your helmet, &s;aid he: look on
<PB N="138" REF="032742_0137_0FF50C9BF12BD078">
that youth, he is the &s;on of your injured kin&s;|man.&mdash;It is him&s;elf! &s;aid the Lord Lovel, and &s;ainted away.</P>
<P>Sir Philip then called for a &s;urgeon and a prie&s;t, both of which Lord Graham had pro|vided: the former began to bind up his wounds, and his a&s;&s;i&s;tants poured a cordial into his mouth.&mdash;Pre&s;erve his life, if it be po&s;&s;ible, &s;aid Sir Philip; for much depends upon it.</P>
<P>He then took Edmund by the hand, and pre&s;ented him to all the company.&mdash;In this young man, &s;aid he, you &s;ee the true heir of the hou&s;e of Lovel! Heaven has in its own way made him the in&s;trument to di&s;cover the death of his parents. His father was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in|ated by order of that wicked man, who now receives his puni&s;hment; his mother was, by his cruel treatment, compelled to leave her own hou&s;e; &s;he was delivered in the fields, and peri&s;hed her&s;elf in &s;eeking a &s;helter for her infant. I have &s;ufficient proof of every thing I &s;ay, which I am ready to communicate to every per&s;on who de&s;ires to know the par|ticulars; Heaven, by my hand, has cha&s;ti&s;ed him: he has confe&s;&s;ed the fact I accu&s;e him of, and it remains that he make re&s;titution of the fortune and honour he hath u&s;urped &s;o long.</P>
<P>Edmund kneeled, and with uplifted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> returned thanks to heaven, that his noble friend and champion was crowned with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">&mdash;The Lords and gentlemen gathered
<PB N="139" REF="032742_0138_0FF50CA9F671BA98">
round them, they congratulated them both; while Lord Lovel's friends and followers were employed in taking care of him. Lord Clif|ford took Sir Philip's hand.&mdash;You have acted with &s;o much honour and prudence, that it is pre&s;umptuous to offer you advice; but what mean you to do with the wounded man?&mdash;I have not determined, &s;aid he; I thank you for the hint, and bog your advice how to proceed.&mdash;Let us con&s;ult Lord Graham, replied he.&mdash;Lord Graham in&s;i&s;ted upon their going all to his ca&s;tle; there, &s;aid he, you will have im|partial witne&s;&s;es of all that pa&s;&s;es. Sir Philip was unwilling to give &s;o much trouble. The Lord Graham prote&s;ted he &s;hould be proud to do any &s;ervice to &s;o noble a gentleman. Lord Clifford enforced his reque&s;t, &s;aying, it was better upon all accounts to keep their pri&s;oner on this &s;ide the borders till they &s;aw what turn his health would take, and to keep him &s;afely till he &s;ettled his worldly affairs.</P>
<P>This re&s;olution being taken, Lord Graham invited the wounded man and his friends to his ca&s;tle, as being the neare&s;t place where he could be lodged and taken proper care of, it being dangerous to carry him any further. They accepted the propo&s;al with many ac|knowledgments; having made a kind of litter of boughs, they all proceeded to Lord Graham's ca&s;tle, where they put Lord Lovel to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, and the &s;urgeon dre&s;&s;ed his wounds and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he might be kept quiet, not knowing at pre&s;ent whether they were dangerous or not.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="032742_0139_0FF50CB6859EB880">
About an hour after, the wounded man com|plained of thir&s;t; he a&s;ked for the &s;urgeon, and inquired if his life was in danger? The &s;urgeon an&s;wered him doubtfully. He a&s;ked&mdash;Where is Sir Philip Harclay?&mdash;In the ca&s;tle&mdash;Where is that young man whom he calls the heir of Lovel?&mdash;He is here, too.&mdash;Then I am &s;urrounded with my enemies. I want to &s;peak to one of my own &s;ervants, without witne&s;&s;es; let one be &s;ent to me.</P>
<P>The &s;urgeon withdrew, and acquainted the gentlemen below.&mdash;He &s;hall not &s;peak to any man, &s;aid Sir Philip, but in my pre&s;ence. He went with him into the &s;ick man's room. Up|on the &s;ight of Sir Philip, he &s;eemed in great agitation.&mdash;Am I not allowed to &s;peak with my own &s;ervant, &s;aid he?&mdash;Yes, Sir, you may; but not without witne&s;&s;es.&mdash;Then I am a pri|&s;oner it &s;eems.&mdash;No, not &s;o, Sir; but &s;ome caution is nece&s;&s;ary at pre&s;ent: But compo&s;e your&s;elf, I do not wi&s;h for your death.&mdash;Then why did you &s;eek it? I never injured you.&mdash;Yes, you have, in the per&s;on of my friend, and I am only the in&s;trument of ju&s;tice in the hand of Heaven; endeavour to make atone|ment while life is &s;pared to you.&mdash;Shall I &s;end the prie&s;t to you? perhaps he may convince you of the nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;titution, in order to obtain forgivene&s;s of your &s;ins.</P>
<P>Sir Philip &s;ent for the prie&s;t and the &s;urgeon, and obliged the &s;ervant to retire with him. I leave you, Sir, to the care of the&s;e gentlemen; and whenever a third per&s;on is admitted, I
<PB N="141" REF="032742_0140_0FF50CC5676A60B8">
will be his attendant: I will vi&s;it you again within an hour. He then retired, and con&s;ult|ed his friends below: they were of opinion that no time &s;hould be lo&s;t.&mdash;You will then, &s;aid he, accompany me into the &s;ick man's apartment in an hour's time.</P>
<P>Within the hour, Sir Philip, attended by Lord Clifford and Lord Graham, entered the chamber. Lord Lovel was in great emotion; the prie&s;t &s;tood on one &s;ide of the bed, the the &s;urgeon on the other; the former exhort|ed him to confe&s;s his &s;ins, the other de&s;ired he might be left to his repo&s;e. Lord Lovel &s;eemed in great angui&s;h of mind; he trembled and was in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion. Sir Philip entreated him with the Piety of a confe&s;&s;or, to con&s;ider his &s;oul's health before that of his bo|dy. He then a&s;ked Sir Philip, by what means he knew that he was concerned in the death of his kin&s;man?&mdash;Sir, replied he, it was not merely by human means this fact was di&s;co|vered. There is a certain apartment in the Ca&s;tle of Lovel, that has been &s;hut up the&s;e one-and-twenty years, but has lately been o|pened and examined into.</P>
<P>Oh Heaven! exclaimed he, then Geoffry mu&s;t have betrayed me!&mdash;No, Sir, he has not, it was revealed in a very extraordinary manner to that youth whom it mo&s;t concerns.&mdash;How can he be the heir of Lovel?&mdash;By be|ing the &s;on of that unfortunate woman, whom you cruelly obliged to leave her own hou&s;e, to avoid being compelled to wed the murder|er
<PB N="142" REF="032742_0141_0FF50CE4618AB738">
of her hu&s;band: we are not ignorant, moreover, of the fictitious funeral you made for her. All is di&s;covered, and you will not tell us any more than we know already; but we de&s;ire to have it confirmed by your con|fe&s;&s;ion. The judgments of Heaven are fallen upon me! &s;aid Lord Lovel. I am childle&s;s, and one is ari&s;en from the grave to claim my inheritance.&mdash;Nothing, then, hinders you to do ju&s;tice and make re&s;titution; it is for the ea&s;e of your con&s;cience; and you have no o|ther way of making atonement for all the mi&s;|chief you have done.&mdash;You know too much, &s;aid the criminal, and I will relate what you do not know.</P>
<P>You may remember, proceeded he, that I &s;aw you once at my uncle's hou&s;e?&mdash;I well re|member.&mdash;At that time my mind was di&s;turb|ed by the baleful pa&s;&s;ion of envy; it was from that root all my bad actions &s;prung.&mdash;Prai&s;e be to God! &s;aid the good prie&s;t, he hath touched your heart with true contrition, and you &s;hew the good effect of his mercies; you will do ju&s;tice, and you will be rewarded by the gift of repentance unto &s;alvation.&mdash;Sir Phi|lip de&s;ired the penitent to proceed.</P>
<P>My kin&s;man excelled me in every kind of merit, in the graces of per&s;on and mind, in all his exerci&s;es, and in every accompli&s;h|ment. I was totally eclip&s;ed by him, and I hated to be in his company; but what fini&s;h|ed my aver&s;ion, was his addre&s;&s;ing the lady upon whom I had fixed my affections: I &s;trove
<PB N="143" REF="032742_0142_0FF50CE77927AB08">
to rival him there, but &s;he gave him the pre|ference, that indeed, was only his due; but I could not bear to &s;ee, or acknowledge it.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t bitter hatred took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my brea&s;t, and I avowed to revenge the &s;up|po&s;ed injury, as &s;oon as opportunity &s;hould of|fer. I buried my re&s;entment deep in my heart, and outwardly appeared to rejoice at his &s;ucce&s;s; I made a merit of re&s;igning my preten&s;ions to him, but I could not bear to be pre&s;ent at his nuptials; I returned to my father's &s;eat, and brooded over my revenge in &s;ecret. My father died this year, and &s;oon after my uncle followed him; within another year my kin&s;man was &s;ummoned to attend the King on his Wel&s;h expedition.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I heard he was gone from home, I re&s;olved to prevent his return, exulting in the pro&s;pect of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing his title, fortune, and his Lady. I hired me&s;&s;engers, who were con&s;tantly going and coming, to give me intel|ligence of all that pa&s;&s;ed at the ca&s;tle; I went there &s;oon after, under pretence of vi&s;iting my kin&s;man. My &s;pies brought me an account of all that happened; one informed me of the event of the battle, but could not tell whether my rival was living or dead; I hoped the lat|ter, that I might avoid the crime I meditated; I reported his death to his Lady, who took it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> heavily.</P>
<P>Soon after a me&s;&s;enger arrived with tidings <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">at he was alive and well, and had obtained <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ave to return home immediately.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="032742_0143_0FF50D0352B3F6C0">
I in&s;tantly di&s;patched my two emi&s;&s;aries, to intercept him on the way. He made &s;o much ha&s;te to return, that he was met within a mile of his own ca&s;tle: he had out rode his &s;ervants, and was alone: They killed him, and drew him a&s;ide out of the highway. They then came to me with all &s;peed, and de&s;ired my orders; it was then about &s;un&s;et: I &s;ent them back to fetch the dead body, which they brought privately into the ca&s;tle: They tied it neck and heels, and put it into a trunk, which they buried under the floor in the clo|&s;et you mentioned. The &s;ight of the body &s;tung me to the heart; I then felt the pangs of remor&s;e, but it was too late: I took every precaution that prudence &s;ugge&s;ted, to pre|vent the di&s;covery; but nothing can be con|cealed from the eye of Heaven.</P>
<P>From that fatal hour, I have never known peace, always in fear of &s;omething impending to di&s;cover my guilt, and to bring me to &s;hame: at length I am overtaken by ju&s;tice. I am brought to a &s;evere reckoning here, and I dread to meet one more &s;evere hereafter.</P>
<P>Enough, &s;aid the prie&s;t; you have done a good work, my &s;on! tru&s;t in the Lord; and now this burden is off your mind, the re&s;t will be made ea&s;y to you.</P>
<P>Lord Lovel took a minute's repo&s;e, and then went on.&mdash;I hope by the hint you gave, Sir Philip, the poor Lady is yet alive?&mdash;No, Sir, &s;he is not: but &s;he died not till after &s;he brought forth a &s;on, whom Heaven made its
<PB N="145" REF="032742_0144_0FF50D12A750AAB0">
in&s;trument to di&s;cover and avenge the death of both his parents.&mdash;They are well avenged! &s;aid he. I have no children to lament for me; all mine have been taken from me in the bloom of youth; only one daughter lived to be twelve years old; I intended her for a wi&s;e for one of my nephews, but within three months I have buried her. He &s;ighed, wept; and was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>The gentlemen pre&s;ent, lifted up their hands and eyes to heaven in &s;ilence. The will of Heaven be obeyed! &s;aid the prie&s;t. My penitent hath confe&s;&s;ed all: what more would you require?&mdash;That he make atone|ment, &s;aid Sir Philip; that he &s;urrender the title and e&s;tate to the right heir, and di&s;po&s;e of his own proper fortune to his neare&s;t rela|tions, and re&s;ign him&s;elf to penitence and pre|paration for a future &s;tate. For this time I leave him with you, father, and will join my prayers with yours for his repentance.</P>
<P>So, &s;aying, he left the room, and was fol|lowed by the Barons and &s;urgeon; the prie&s;t alone remaining with him. As &s;oon as they were out of hearing, Sir Philip que&s;tioned the &s;urgeon concerning his patient's &s;ituation; who an&s;wered, that at pre&s;ent, he &s;aw no &s;ings of immediate danger, but he could not yet pro|nounce that there was none: If he were mortally wounded, &s;aid he, he could not be &s;o well, nor &s;peak &s;o long without faint|ne&s;s; and, it is my opinion, that he will &s;oon

recover, if nothing happens to retard the cure. Then, &s;aid Sir Philip, keep this opinion from him; for I would &s;uffer the fear of death to operate on him, until he hath per|formed &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary acts of ju&s;tice: Let it only be known to the&s;e noblemen, upon who&s;e honour I can rely, and I tru&s;t they will ap|prove my reque&s;t to you, Sir.&mdash;I join in it, &s;aid Lord Clifford, from the &s;ame motives.&mdash;I in&s;i&s;t upon it, &s;aid Lord Graham; and I can an&s;wer for my &s;urgeon's di&s;cretion.&mdash;My Lords, &s;aid the &s;urgeon, you may de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">end on my fidelity; and, after what I have ju&s;t heard, my con&s;cience is engaged in this noble gen|tleman's behalf, and I will do every thing in my power to &s;econd your intentions.&mdash;I thank you, Sir, &s;aid Sir Philip, and you may de|pend on my gratitude in return. I pre&s;ume you will &s;it up with him to-night: if any dan|ger &s;hould ari&s;e, I de&s;ire to be called imme|diately; but, otherwi&s;e, I would &s;uffer him to re&s;t quietly, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> may be prepared for the bu&s;ine&s;s of the following day.&mdash;I &s;hall obey your directions, Sir, my nece&s;&s;ary attendance will give me a pretence not to leave him, and thus I &s;hall hear all that pa&s;&s;es between him and all that vi&s;it him.&mdash;You will oblige me highly, &s;aid Sir Philip, and I &s;hall go to re&s;t with confidence in your care.</P>
<P>The &s;urgeon returned to the &s;ick man's chamber, Sir Philip and the Baron<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the company below: they &s;upped in the great hall with all the gentlemen that were pre&s;ent at the

combat. Sir Philip and his Edmund retired to their repo&s;e, being heartily fatigued; and the company &s;tayed to a late hour, comment|ing upon the action of the day, prai&s;ing the courage and genero&s;ity of the noble Knight, and wi&s;hing a good event to his undertaking.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of Lord Lovel's friends went away as &s;oon as they &s;aw him &s;afely lodged, being a|&s;hamed of him, and of their appearance in his behalf; and the few that &s;tayed were induced by their de&s;ire of a further information of the ba&s;e action he had committed, and to ju&s;tify their own characters and conduct.</P>
<P>The next morning, Sir Philip entered into con&s;ultation with the two Barons, on the me|thods he &s;hould take to get Edmund received and acknowledged as heir of the hou&s;e of Lo|vel. They were all of opinion, that the crimi|nal &s;hould be kept in fear till he had &s;ettled his worldly affairs, and they had re&s;olved how to di&s;po&s;e of him. With this determination, they entered his room, and inquired of the &s;urgeon how he had pa&s;&s;ed the night? He &s;hook his head, and &s;aid but little.</P>
<P>Lord Lovel de&s;ired that he might be remov|ed to his own hou&s;e. Lord Graham &s;aid, he could not con&s;ent to that, as there was evident danger in removing him; and appealed to the &s;urgeon, who confirmed his opinion. Lord Graham de&s;ired he would make him&s;elf ea&s;y, and that he &s;hould have every kind of a&s;&s;i&s;tance there.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="032742_0147_0FF50D326A12EF60">
Sir Philip then propo&s;ed to &s;end for the Lord Fitz-Owen, who would &s;ee that all po&s;&s;i|ble care was taken of his brother-in-law, and would a&s;&s;i&s;t him in &s;ettling his affairs. Lord Lovel was again&s;t it; he was peevi&s;h and un|ea&s;y, and de&s;ired to be left with only his own &s;ervants to attend him. Sir Philip quitted the room with a &s;ignificant look: and the two Lords endeavoured to reconcile him to his &s;ituation. He interrupted them.&mdash;It is ea&s;y for men in your &s;ituation to advi&s;e, but it is difficult for one in mine to practice; wounded in body and mind, it is natural that I &s;hould &s;trive to avoid the extremes of &s;hame and pun|i&s;hment: I thank you for your kind offices, and beg I may be left with my own &s;ervants&mdash;With them, and the &s;urgeon, you &s;hall, &s;aid Lord Graham; and they both retired.</P>
<P>Sir Philip met them below.&mdash;My Lords, &s;aid he, I am de&s;irous that my Lord Fitz-Owen &s;hould be &s;ent for, and that he may hear his brother's confe&s;&s;ion; for I &s;u&s;pect that he may hereafter deny, what only the fear of death has extorted from him: with your permi&s;&s;ion, I am determinined to &s;end me&s;&s;engers to day. They both expre&s;&s;ed their approbation, and Lord Clifford propo&s;ed to write to him, &s;aying, a letter from an imparti|al per&s;on will have the more weight: I will &s;end one of my principal dome&s;tics with your own. This mea&s;ure being re&s;olved upon, Lord Clifford retired to write, and Sir Philip to prepare his &s;ervants for in&s;tant departure. Ed|mund

de&s;ired leave to write to father O&s;wald, and John Wyatt was ordered to be the bearer of his letter. When the Lord Clifford had fini&s;hed his letter, he read it to Sir Philip and his cho&s;en friends, as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Right Hon. my good Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have taken upon me to acquaint your Lord&s;hip, that there has been a &s;olemn combat at arms between your brother-in-law, the Lord Lovel, and Sir Philip Har|clay, Knt. of York&s;hire. It was fought in the juri&s;diction of the Lord Graham, who, with my&s;elf, was appointed judge of the field; it was fairly won, and Sir Philip is the conqueror. After he had gained the victory, he declared at large the cau&s;e of the quarrel, and that he had revenged the death of Arthur Lord Lovel, his friend, whom the pre&s;ent Lord Lovel had a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in|ated, that he might enjoy his title and e&s;|tate. The wounded man confe&s;&s;ed the fact: and Sir Philip gave him his life, and only carried off his &s;word as a trophy of his victory. Both the victor and the van|qui&s;hed were conveyed to Lord Graham's ca&s;tle, where the Lord Lovel now lies in great danger. He is de&s;irous to &s;ettle his worldly affairs, and to make his peace with God and man. Sir Philip Harclay &s;ays, there is a male heir of the hou&s;e of Lovel, for whom he claims the title and e&s;tate: but he is very de&s;irous that your

Let me entreat you, on the receipt of this letter, to &s;et out imme|diately for Lord Graham's ca&s;tle, where you will be received with the utmo&s;t re&s;pect and ho&s;pitality.

</LETTER>
<P>Every one pre&s;ent expre&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t ap|probation of this letter. Sir Philip gave or|ders to John Wyatt to be very circum&s;pect in his behaviour, to give Edmund's letter pri|vately to father O&s;wald, and to make no men|tion of him, or his preten&s;ions to Lovel's Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Lord Clifford gave his &s;ervant the requi&s;ite precautions. Lord Graham added a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of invitation, and &s;ent it by a &s;ervant of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words">.&mdash;As &s;oon as all things were ready, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

me&s;&s;engers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with all &s;peed for the Ca&s;tle of Lovel.</P>
<P>They &s;tayed no longer by the way than to take &s;ome refre&s;hment, but rode night and day till they arrived there.</P>
<P>Lord Fitz-Owen was in the parlour with his children. Father O&s;wald was walking in the avenue before the hou&s;e, when he &s;aw three me&s;&s;engers, who&s;e hor&s;es &s;eemed jaded and the riders fatigued, like men come a long journey. He came up, ju&s;t as the fir&s;t had de|livered his me&s;&s;age to the porter. John Wyatt knew him, he di&s;mounted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">and made &s;igns that he had &s;omething to &s;ay to him; he re|tired back a few &s;teps, and John, with great dexterity, &s;lipped a letter into his hand.

<P>O&s;wald followed the me&s;&s;engers into the hall, a &s;ervant announced their arrival. Lord Fitz-Owen received them in the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">lour&punc; Lord Clifford's &s;ervant delivered his ma&s;ter's letter, Lord Graham's his, and they &s;aid they would retire, and wait his Lord&s;hip's an&s;wer.

They retired, and he opened his letters; He read them with great agitations, he &s;truck his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> upon his heart, he exclaimed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fears are all verified! the blow is &s;truck, and it ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> upon the guilty!</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="032742_0151_0FF50D515E7948E8">
O&s;wald came in a minute <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.&mdash;You are come in good time, &s;aid the Baron. Read that letter, that my children may know the contents. He read it with faultering voice, and trembling limbs. They were all in great &s;urpri&s;e. William looked down, and kept a &s;tudied &s;ilence. Sir Robert exclaimed&mdash;Is it po&s;&s;ible? can my uncle be guilty of &s;uch an action?&mdash;You hear, &s;aid the Baron, he has confe&s;&s;ed it!&mdash;But to whom? &s;aid Sir Robert.&mdash;His father replied, Lord Clifford's honour is unque&s;tionable, and I cannot doubt what he affirms.</P>
<P>Sir Robert leaned his head upon his hand, as one lo&s;t in thought: at length he &s;eemed to awake&mdash;My Lord, I have no doubt that Ed|mund is at th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ttom of this bu&s;ine&s;s. Do you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t remember <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> Sir Philip Harclay long ago promi&s;ed him his friend&s;hip? Edmund di&s;appears; and, &s;oon after, this man chal|lenges my Uncle. You know what pa&s;&s;ed here before his departure: he has &s;ugge&s;ted this affair to Sir Philip, and in&s;tigated him to this action. This is the return he has made for the favours he has received from our fa|mily, to which he owes every thing.&mdash;Softly, my &s;on! &s;aid the Baron; let us be cautious of reflecting upon Edmund: there is a great|er hand in this bu&s;ine&s;s. My conjecture was too true: it was in that fatal apartment that he was made acquainted with the circum&s;tan|ces of Lord Lovel's death; he was, perhaps enjoined to reveal them to Sir Philip Harclay&punc;
<PB N="153" REF="032742_0152_0FF50D572CC97058">
the bo&s;om friend of the decea&s;ed. The my|&s;tery of that apartment is di&s;clo&s;ed, the woe to the guilty is accompli&s;hed; there is no reflection upon any one; Heaven effects its purpo&s;es in its own time and manner. I and mine are innocent; let us wor&s;hip, and be &s;i|lent!</P>
<P>But what do you propo&s;e to do? &s;aid Sir Robert.&mdash;To return with the me&s;&s;engers, an|&s;wered the Baron. I think it highly proper that I &s;hould &s;ee your Uncle, and hear what he has to &s;ay: My children are his heirs; in ju&s;tice to them, I ought to be acquainted with every thing that concerns the di&s;po&s;al of his fortune.&mdash;Your Lord&s;hip is in the right, an|&s;wered Sir Robert, it concerns us all. I have only to a&s;k your permi&s;&s;ion to bear you com|pany.&mdash;With all my heart, &s;aid the Baron: I have only to a&s;k of you in return, that you will command your&s;elf, and not &s;peak your mind ha&s;tily; wait for the proofs before you give judgment, and take advice of your rea|&s;on before you decide upon any thing: If you reflect upon the pa&s;t, you will have rea&s;on to di&s;tru&s;t your&s;elf. Leave all to me, and be a&s;|&s;ured I will protect your honour and my own. I will obey you in all things, my Lord; and will make immediate preparation for our de|parture.

on account of the Baron's health, which began to be impaired, and arrived in health and &s;pirits at the ca&s;tle of Lord Graham, where they were received with the utmo&s;t re|&s;pect and kindne&s;s by the noble Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The Lord Lovel had recovered his health and &s;trength as much as po&s;&s;ible in the time, and was impatient to be gone from thence to his own hou&s;e. He was &s;urpri&s;ed to hear of the arrival of his brother and nephews, and expre&s;&s;ed no plea&s;ure at the thoughts of &s;eeing them. When Sir Philip Harclay came to pay his re&s;pects to Baron Fitz-Owen, the latter received him with civility, but with a cold|ne&s;s that was apparent.

<P>The Baron was &s;oftened, his noble heart felt its alliance with its counterpart, but he thought the &s;ituation of his brother demand|ed &s;ome re&s;erve towards the man who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> his life; but, in &s;pite of him&s;elf, it wore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> every moment. Lord Clifford related all that had pa&s;&s;ed, with a due regard to Sir Philip's honour; he remarked how nobly he conceal|ed

the cau&s;e of his re&s;entment again&s;t the Lord Lovel till the day of combat, that he might not prepo&s;&s;e&s;s the judges again&s;t him. He enlarged on his humanity to the vanqui&s;h|ed, on the de&s;ire he expre&s;&s;ed to have ju&s;tice done to his heirs: finally, he mentioned his great re&s;pect for the Lord Fitz-Owen, and the &s;olicitude he &s;hewed to have him come to &s;ettle the e&s;tate of the &s;ick man in favour of his children.

The Lord Fitz-Owen went up to the bed-&s;ide; he embraced his brother with &s;trong emotions of concern; Sir Robert followed him: then Mr. William. Lord Lovel embraced them, but &s;aid nothing; his countenance &s;hewed his inward agitations.&mdash;Lord Fitz-Owen fir&s;t broke &s;ilence.&mdash;I hope, &s;aid he, I &s;ee my brother better than I expected.&mdash;Lord Lo|vel bit his fingers, he pulled the bed-clothes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;eemed almo&s;t di&s;tracted; at length he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">oke out&mdash;I owe no thanks to tho&s;e who &s;ent for my relations!

<P>Sir Philip then came forward.&mdash;My Lords, I &s;hall take no notice of what this unhappy man has ju&s;t now &s;aid; I &s;hall appeal to you, as to the honourable witne&s;&s;es of all that has pa&s;&s;ed: You &s;ee it was no more than nece&s;&s;a|ry.

I did not take his life, as I might have done; I wi&s;hed him to repent of his &s;ins, and to make re&s;titution of what he unju&s;tly po&s;&s;e&s;s|es. I was called out to do an act of ju&s;tice; I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ad taken the heir of Lovel under my protection, my chief view was to &s;ee ju&s;tice done to him; what regarded this man was but a &s;econdary motive.

<P>Lord Lovel &s;eemed almo&s;t choaked with pa&s;&s;ion, to &s;ee every one giving &s;ome mark of approbation and re&s;pect to Sir Philip.

Here is a young man, &s;uppo&s;ed the &s;on of a pea&s;ant, who, by a train of circum&s;tances that could not have happened by human con|trivance, di&s;covers not only who were his real parents, but that they came to untimely deaths. He even di&s;covers the different places where their bones are buried, both out of con&s;ecrat|ed ground, and appeals to their a&s;hes for the truth of his preten&s;ions. He has al&s;o living proofs to offer, that will convince the mo&s;t incredulous.

<P>Lord Graham applauded Sir Philip's appeal, affirming his own impartiality, and calling up|on Lord Clifford and his &s;ons, and al&s;o his own nephew who were pre&s;ent.

<P>Sir Philip bowed to the company; he went out and brought in Edmund, encouraging him by the way; he pre&s;ented him to Baron Fitz-Owen, who looked very &s;erious&mdash;Edmund Twyford, &s;aid he, are you the heir of the hou&s;e of Lovel?&mdash;I am, my Lord, &s;aid Edmund, bowing to the ground; the proofs will appear; but I am at the &s;ame time, the mo&s;t humble and grateful of all your &s;ervants, and the &s;er|vant of your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">tues.

and was going to leave the room.&mdash;Son Ro|bert, &s;tay, &s;aid the Baron: If there is any fraud, you will be plea&s;ed to detect it, and if all that is affirmed be true, you will not &s;hut your eyes again&s;t the light: you are con|cerned in this bu&s;ine&s;s: hear it in &s;ilence, and let rea&s;on be arbiter in your cau&s;e. He bow|ed to his father, bit his lip, and retired to the window. William nodded to Edmund, and was &s;ilent. All the company had their eyes fixed on the young man, who &s;tood in the mid&s;t, ca&s;ting down his eyes with mode&s;t re&s;pect to the audience: while Sir Philip re|lated all the material circum&s;tances of his life, the wonderful gradation by which he came to the knowledge of his birth, the adventures of the haunted apartment, the di&s;covery of the fatal clo&s;et, and the pre&s;umptive proofs that Lord Lovel was buried there. At this part of his narration, Lord Fitz-Owen interrupted him&mdash;Where is this clo&s;et you talk of? for I and my &s;ons went over the apartment &s;ince Edmund's departure, and found no &s;uch place as you de&s;cribe.&mdash;My Lord, &s;aid Edmund, I can account for it; the door is covered with tape&s;try, the &s;ame as the room, and you might ea&s;ily overlook it; but I have a witne&s;s here, &s;aid he, and putting his hand into his bo&s;om, he drew out the key.

&s;aid the Baron.&mdash;To prevent any per&s;on from going into it, replied Edmund; I have vowed to keep it till I &s;hall open the clo&s;et before witne&s;&s;es appointed for that purpo&s;e.&mdash;Pro|ceed, Sir, &s;aid the Baron Fitz-Owen.&mdash;Sir Philip then related the conver&s;ation between Edmund and Margery Twyford, his &s;uppo&s;ed mother.&mdash;Lord Fitz-Owen &s;eemed in the ut|mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;e: He exclaimed,&mdash;Can this be true? &s;trange di&s;covery! unfortunate child&mdash;Edmund's tears bore witne&s;s to his veracity; he was obliged to hide his face, he lifted up his cla&s;ped hands to heaven, and was in great emotions during all this part of the relation; while Lord Lovel groaned, and &s;eemed in great agitation.</P>
<P>Sir Philip then addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to Lord Fitz-Owen.

<P>O&s;wald then began. Since I am now pro|perly called upon to te&s;tify what I know con|cerning this young man, I will &s;peak the truth, without fear or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">our of any one; and I will &s;wear by the rules of my holy order, to the truth of what I &s;hall relate. He then gave a

particular account of all that pa&s;&s;ed on that occa&s;ion, and mentioned the tokens found on both the infant and his mother.&mdash;Where are the&s;e tokens to be &s;een? &s;aid the Lord Clif|ford.&mdash;I have them here, my Lord, &s;aid Ed|mund, and I keep them as my greate&s;t trea|&s;ures. He then produced them before all the company.&mdash;There is no appearance of any fraud or collu&s;ion, &s;aid Lord Graham: if any man thinks he &s;ees any, let him &s;peak.&mdash;Pray, my Lord, &s;uffer me to &s;peak a word, &s;aid Sir Robert. Do you remember that I hinted my &s;u&s;picions concerning father O&s;wald, the night our kin&s;man lay in the ea&s;t apartment?&mdash;I do, &s;aid the Baron.&mdash;Well, Sir, it now appears that he did know more than he would tell us; you find he is very deep in all Ed|mund's &s;ecrets, and you may judge what were his motives for undertaking this journey.&mdash;I ob&s;erve what you &s;ay, an&s;wered his father, but let us hear all that O&s;wald has to &s;ay: I will be as impartial as po&s;&s;ible.&mdash;My Lord, re|turned O&s;wald, I beg you al&s;o to recollect what I &s;aid, on the night your &s;on &s;peaks of, concerning &s;ecrecy in certain matters.&mdash;I re|member that al&s;o, &s;aid the Baron; but pro|ceed.&mdash;My Lord, continued O&s;wald, I knew more than I thought my&s;elf at liberty to di&s;|clo&s;e at that time, but I will now tell you e|very thing. I &s;aw there was &s;omething more than common in the accidents that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">efel this young man, and in his being called out to &s;leep in the ea&s;t apartment; I earne&s;tly de&s;ir|ed

him to let me be with him on the &s;econd night, to which he con&s;ented reluctantly; we heard a great noi&s;e in the rooms underneath, we went down &s;tairs together, I &s;aw him open the fatal clo&s;et, I heard groans that pierced me to the heart, I kneeled down and prayed for the repo&s;e of the &s;pirit departed; I found a &s;eal, with the arms of Lovel engraven upon it, which I gave to Edmund, and he now has it in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: He enjoined me to keep &s;ecret what I had &s;een and heard, till the time &s;hould come to declare it. I conceived that I was called to be a witne&s;s of the&s;e things; be|&s;ides, my curio&s;ity was excited to know the event; I, therefore, de&s;ired to be pre&s;ent at the interview between him and his mother, which was affecting beyond expre&s;&s;ion; I heard what I have now declared as nearly as my memory permits me. I hope no impartial per&s;on will blame me for any part of my con|duct; but if they &s;hould, I do not repent it: If I &s;hould forfeit the favour of the rich and great, I &s;hall have acquitted my&s;elf to God and my con&s;cience. I have no worldly ends to an&s;wer; I plead the cau&s;e of the injured orphan; and I think, al&s;o, that I &s;econd the de&s;igns of Providence.&mdash;You have well &s;po|ken, father, &s;aid the Lord Clifford: your te&s;|timony is indeed of con&s;equence.</P>
<P>It is amazing and convincing, &s;aid Lord Graham; and the whole &s;tory is &s;o well con|nected, that I can &s;ee nothing to make us doubt the truth of it: But let us examine the
<PB N="166" REF="032742_0165_0FF50DE67964B408">
proofs. Edmund gave into their hands the necklace and ear-rings; he &s;hewed them the locket with the cypher of Lovel, and the &s;eal with the arms; he told them the cloak in which he was wrapped was in the cu&s;tody of his fo&s;ter-mother, who would produce it on demand. He begged that &s;ome proper per|&s;ons might be commi&s;&s;ioned to go with him to examine whether or no the bodies of his pa|rents were buried where he affirmed; adding, that he put his preten&s;ions into their hands with plea&s;ure, relying entirely upon their ho|nour and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>During this intere&s;ting &s;cene, the crimi|nal covered his face, and was &s;ilent, but he &s;ent forth bitter &s;ighs and groans that denoted the angui&s;h of his heart. At length, Lord Graham, in compa&s;&s;ion to him, propo&s;ed that they &s;hould retire and con&s;ider of the proofs; adding, Lord Lovel mu&s;t needs be fatigued; we will re&s;ume the &s;ubject in his pre&s;ence, when he is di&s;po&s;ed to receive us. Sir, &s;aid he, I now leave you in the hands of your own relations; they are men of &s;trict honour, and I confide in them to take care of you, and of your concerns. They then went out of the room, leaving only the Lord Fitz-Owen and his &s;ons with the criminal. They di&s;cour&s;ed of the wonderful &s;tory of Edmund's birth, and the principal events of his life.</P>
<P>After dinner, Sir Philip reque&s;ted another conference with the Lords, and their princi|pal friends. There were pre&s;ent al&s;o, father
<PB N="167" REF="032742_0166_0FF50E05D85537B0">
O&s;wald, and Lord Graham's confe&s;&s;or, who had taken the Lord Lovel's confe&s;&s;ion, Ed|mund, and Zadi&s;ky. Now, gentlemen, &s;aid Sir Philip, I de&s;ire to know your opinion of our proofs, and your advice upon them.</P>
<P>Lord Graham replied, I am de&s;ired to &s;peak for the re&s;t: We think there are &s;trong pre|&s;umptive proofs that this young man is the true heir of Lovel; but they ought to be con|firmed and authenticated. Of the murder of the late Lord there is no doubt; the criminal hath confe&s;&s;ed it, and the circum&s;tances con|firm it; the proofs of his crime are &s;o con|nected with tho&s;e of the young man's birth, that one cannot be public without the other. We are de&s;irous to do ju&s;tice; and yet are unwilling for the Lord Fitz-Owen's &s;ake, to bring the criminal to public &s;hame and puni&s;h|ment. We wi&s;h to find out a medium; we therefore de&s;ire Sir Philip to make propo&s;als for his ward, and let Lord Fitz-Owen an&s;wer for him&s;elf and his brother, and we will be moderators between them. Here every one expre&s;&s;ed approbation, and called upon Sir Philip to make his demands.</P>
<P>If, &s;aid he, I were to demand &s;trict ju&s;tice, I &s;hould not be &s;atisfied with any thing le&s;s than the life of the criminal; but I am a Chri&s;|tian &s;oldier, the di&s;ciple of him who came in|to the world to &s;ave &s;inners; for his &s;ake, continued he (cro&s;&s;ing him&s;elf) I forego my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">evenge, I &s;pare the guilty: If Heaven gives him time of repentance, man &s;hould not deny
<PB N="168" REF="032742_0167_0FF50E18F4FDAC80">
it. It is my ward's particular reque&s;t, that I will not bring &s;hame upon the hou&s;e of his benefactor, the Lord Fitz-Owen, for whom he hath a filial affection and profound vene|ration. My propo&s;als are the&s;e: Fir&s;t, that the criminal make re&s;titution of the title and e&s;tate, obtained with &s;o much inju&s;tice and cruelty, to the lawful heir, whom he &s;hall ac|konwledge &s;uch before witne&s;&s;es, Second|ly, that he &s;hall &s;urrender his own lawful in|heritance and per&s;onal e&s;tate into the hands of Lord Fitz-Owen, in tru&s;t for his &s;ons, who are his heirs of blood. Thirdly, that he &s;hall retire into a religious hou&s;e, or el&s;e quit the kingdom, in three months time; and, in either ca&s;e, tho&s;e who enjoy his fortune &s;hall allow him a decent annuity, that he may not want the comforts of life. By the la&s;t, I di&s;|able him from the means of doing further mi&s;|chief, and enable him to devote the remainder of his days to penitence. The&s;e are my pro|po&s;als, and I give him four-and-twenty hours to con&s;ider of them; if he refu&s;es to comply with them, I &s;hall be obliged to proceed to &s;everer mea&s;ures, and to a public pro&s;ecution: But the goodne&s;s of the Lord Fitz-Owen bids me expect, from his influence with his bro|ther, a compliance with propo&s;als made out of re&s;pect to his honourable character.</P>
<P>Lord Graham applauded the humanity, p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|dence, and piety of Sir Philip's propo&s;als. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> enforced them with all his influence and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">|quence.

the re&s;t gave tokens of approbation. Sir Ro|bert Fitz-Owen then ro&s;e up&mdash;I beg leave to ob&s;erve to the company, who are going to di&s;po&s;e &s;o generou&s;ly of another man's proper|ty, that my father purcha&s;ed the ca&s;tle and e&s;tate of the hou&s;e of Lovel: Who is to re|pay him the money for it?</P>
<P>Sir Philip then &s;aid, I have al&s;o a que&s;tion to a&s;k. Who is to pay the arrears of my ward's e&s;tate, which he has unju&s;tly been kept out of the&s;e one-and-twenty years? Let Lord Clifford an&s;wer to both points, for he is not intere&s;ted in either.&mdash;Lord Clifford &s;mil|ed&mdash;I think, returned he, the fir&s;t que&s;tion is an&s;wered by the &s;econd, and that the par|ties concerned &s;hould &s;et one again&s;t the o|ther, e&s;pecially as Lord Fitz-Owen's children will inherit the fortune, which includes the purcha&s;e-money. Lord Graham &s;aid, This determination is both equitable and generous, and I hope will an&s;wer the expectations on all &s;ides.&mdash;I have another propo&s;al to make to my Lord Fitz-Owen, &s;aid Sir Philip; but I fir&s;t wait for the acceptance of tho&s;e already made.&mdash;Lord Fitz-Owen replied, I &s;hall re|port them to my brother, and acquaint the company with his re&s;olution to-morrow.</P>
<P>They then &s;eparated; and the Baron, with his &s;ons, returned to the &s;ick man's cham|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">&punc; there he exhorted his brother, with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of a confe&s;&s;or, to repent of his &s;ins, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> atonement for them.

Your repentance, continued he, may be accepted, and your crime may yet be pardoned: If you continue refractory, and refu&s;e to make atonement, you will draw down upon you a &s;evere pu|ni&s;hment. The criminal would not confe&s;s, and yet could not deny the truth and ju&s;tice of his ob&s;ervations. The Baron &s;pent &s;everal hours in his brother's chamber; he &s;ent for a prie&s;t, who took his confe&s;&s;ion; and they both &s;at up with him all night, advi&s;ing, per|&s;uading, and exhorting him to do ju&s;tice, and to comply with the propo&s;als.

<P>The next day Lord Fitz-Owen &s;ummoned &s;he company into his brother's chamber, and there declared, in his name, that he accepted Sir Philip Harclay's propo&s;als; that, if the young man could, as he promi&s;ed, direct them to the places where his parents were bu|ried, and if his birth &s;hould be authenticated by his fo&s;ter-parents, he &s;hould be acknow|ledged the heir of the hou&s;e of Lovel.

How on me? &s;aid the Baron.&mdash;Why, he will not be happy unle&s;s you honour him with your notice and e&s;teem; but this is not all, I mu&s;t hope that you will &s;till do more for him.&mdash;Indeed, &s;aid the Baron, he has put my regard for him to a &s;evere proof; what further can be expected from me?&mdash;My dear Lord, be not offended, I have only one more propo&s;al to make to you; if you refu&s;e it, I can allow for you; and I confe&s;s it requires a greatne&s;s of mind, but not more than you po&s;&s;e&s;s to grant it.&mdash;Well, Sir, &s;peak your demand.&mdash;Say rather my reque&s;t; it is this ca&s;e: Cea&s;e to look upon Edmund as the enemy of your hou&s;e; look upon him as a &s;on, and make him &s;o in|deed.&mdash;How &s;ay you, Sir Philip? my &s;on!&mdash;Yes, my Lord, give him your daughter: He is already your &s;on in filial affection; your &s;on William and he are &s;worn brothers; what remains but to make him yours? He de|&s;erves &s;uch a parent, you &s;uch a &s;on; and you will, by this means, ingraft into your family, the name, title, and e&s;tate of Lovel, which will be entailed on your po&s;terity for ever. This offer requires much con&s;ideration, re|turned the Baron.&mdash;Suffer me to &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome hints to you, &s;aid Sir Philip. This match is, I think, verily pointed out by Providence,

which hath conducted the dear boy through &s;o many dangers, and brought him within view of his happine&s;s; look on him as the precious relic of a noble hou&s;e, the &s;on of my deare&s;t friend! or look on him as my &s;on and heir, let me, as his father, implore you to con|&s;ent to his marriage with your daughter. The Baron's heart was touched, he turned away his face.&mdash;Oh, Sir Philip Harclay, what a friend are you! why &s;hould &s;uch a man be our enemy?&mdash;My Lord, &s;aid Sir Philip, we are not, cannot be enemies; our hearts are already allied; and I am certain we &s;hall one day be dear friends. The Baron &s;uppre&s;&s;ed his emotions, but Sir Philip &s;aw into his heart. I mu&s;t con&s;ult my elde&s;t &s;on, returned he.&mdash;Then replied Sir Philip, I fore&s;ee much dif|ficulty; he is prejudiced again&s;t Edmund, and thinks the re&s;titution of his inheritance an injury to your family: Hereafter he will &s;ee this alliance in a different light, and will re|joice that &s;uch a brother is added to the fa|mily; but, at pre&s;ent, he will &s;et his face a|gain&s;t it. However, we will not de&s;pair: vir|tue and re&s;olution will &s;urmount all ob&s;tacles. Let me call in young Lovel.</P>
<P>He brought Edmund to the Baron, and acquainted him with the propo&s;al he had been making in his name, my Lord's an&s;wers, and the objections he feared on the part of Sir Ro|bert.

Oh, my Lord, reject not my hone&s;t &s;uit!

di&s;tance; but, in my &s;ituation, I &s;hould have thought it a violation of the laws of gratitude and ho&s;pitality to have pre&s;umed to &s;peak the &s;entiments of my heart.&mdash;Then you have acted with unque&s;tionable honour on this, and I mu&s;t &s;ay, on all other occa&s;ions.&mdash;Your ap|probation, my Lord, is the fir&s;t wi&s;h of my life; it is the &s;eal of my honour and happi|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Sir Philip &s;miled: My Lord Fitz-Owen, I am jealous of Edmund's preferable regard for you: it is ju&s;t the &s;ame now as formerly Ed|mund came to Sir Philip, he threw him&s;elf into his arms, he wept, he was overpowered with the feelings of his heart: he prayed to Heaven to &s;trengthen his mind to &s;upport his inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;en&s;ations. I am overwhelm|ed with obligation! &s;aid he: oh, be&s;t of friends, teach me, like you, to make my ac|tions &s;peak for me!&mdash;Enough, Edmund, I know your heart, and that is my &s;ecurity.

<P>Edmund went immediately to his friend William and related all that had pa&s;&s;ed be|tween the Baron, Sir Philip, and him&s;elf. William promi&s;ed him his intere&s;t in the warme&s;t manner: he recapitulated all that had pa&s;&s;ed in the Ca&s;tle &s;ince his departure; but he guarded his &s;i&s;ter's delicacy, till it &s;hould be re&s;olved to give way to his addre&s;s. They both con&s;ulted young Clifford, who had con|ceived an affection to Edmund for his amiable qualities, and to William for his generous friend&s;hip for him. He promi&s;ed them his a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, as Sir Robert &s;eemed de&s;irous to culti|vate his friend&s;hip. Accordingly, they both at|tacked him with the whole artillery of friend&s;hip and per&s;ua&s;ion. Clifford urged the merits of Edmund, and the advantages of his alliance; William enforced his arguments by a retro|&s;pect of Edmund's pa&s;t life; and ob&s;erved that every ob&s;tacle thrown in his way had brought his enemies to &s;hame, and increa&s;e of honour to him&s;elf.&mdash;I &s;ay nothing, continued he, of his noble qualities and affectionate heart: tho&s;e who have been &s;o many years his compa|nions, can want no proofs of it.&mdash;We know your attachment to him, Sir, &s;aid Robert; and in con&s;equence, your partiality.&mdash;Nay, replied William, you are &s;en&s;ible of the truth of my a&s;&s;ertions; and, I am confident, would have loved him your&s;elf, but for the in&s;inua|tion of his enemies: but if he &s;hould make

good his a&s;&s;ertions, even you mu&s;t be con|vinced of his veracity.&mdash;And you would have my father give him your &s;i&s;ter upon this un|certainty?&mdash;No, Sir, but upon the&s;e condi|tions.&mdash;But &s;uppo&s;e he does not make them good?&mdash;Then I will be of your party, and give up his intere&s;t.&mdash;Very well, Sir; my father may do as he plea&s;es; but I cannot a|gree to give my &s;i&s;ter to one who has always &s;tood in the way of our family, and now turns us out of our own hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry, brother, you &s;ee his preten&s;ions in &s;o wrong a light; but if you think there is any impo&s;ture in the ca&s;e, go with us, and be a witne&s;s of all that pa&s;&s;es.&mdash;No, not I; if Ed|mund is to be ma&s;ter of the ca&s;tle, I will ne|ver &s;et my foot in it.&mdash;This matter, &s;aid Mr. Clifford, mu&s;t be left to time, which has brought &s;tranger things to pa&s;s. Sir Robert's honour and good &s;en&s;e will enable him to &s;ub|due his prejudices, and to judge impartially. They took leave, and went to make prepara|tions for their journey.</P>
<P>Edmund made his report of Sir Robert's inflexibility to his father, in pre&s;ence of Sir Phi|lip; who, again, ventured to urge the Ba|ron on his favorite &s;ubject.&mdash;It becomes me to wait for the further proofs, &s;aid he; but, if they are as clear as I expect, I will not be in|exorable to your wi&s;hes: &s;ay nothing more on this &s;ubject till the return of the commi&s;&s;ion|ers. They were profu&s;e in their acknowledg|ments of his goodne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="032742_0177_0FF50EB04F588338">
Edmund took a tender leave of his two paternal friends:&mdash;When, &s;aid he, I take po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of my inheritance, I mu&s;t hope for the company of you both to complete my happi|ne&s;s.&mdash;Of me, &s;aid Sir Philip, you may be certain; and, as far as my influence reaches, of the Baron.&mdash;He was &s;ilent, Edmund a&s;&s;ured them of his con&s;tant prayers for their happi|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Soon after, the commi&s;&s;ioners, with Ed|mund, &s;et out for Lovel Ca&s;tle: and the fol|lowing day the Lord Clifford &s;et out for his own hou&s;e, with Baron Fitz-Owen and his &s;on. The nominal Baron was carried with them, very much again&s;t his will. Sir Philip Har|clay was invited to go with them by Lord Clif|ford, who declared his pre&s;ence nece&s;&s;ary to bring things to a conclu&s;ion. They all joined in acknowledging their obligations to Lord Graham's generous ho&s;pitality, and be&s;ought him to accompany them; he con&s;ented, on condition they would allow him to go to and fro, as his duty &s;hould call him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">.</P>
<P>Lord Clifford received them with the great|e&s;t ho&s;pitality, and pre&s;ented them to his La|dy, and three daughters, who are in the bloom of youth and beauty.

William and his &s;ervant put forward, and ar|rived &s;everal hours before the re&s;t, to make preparations for their reception. His &s;i&s;ter and brother received them with open arms, and inquired eagerly after the event of the journey to the North. He gave them a brief account of every thing that had happened to their uncle; adding, but this is not all: Sir Philip has brought a young man who he pre|tends is the &s;on of the late Lord Lovel, and claims his e&s;tate and title. This per&s;on is on his journey hither, with &s;everal others who are commi&s;&s;ioned to inquire into certain parti|culars, to confirm his preten&s;ions:&mdash;If he make good his claim my father will &s;urrender the Ca&s;tle and e&s;tate into his hands.&mdash;Sir Phi|lip and my Lord have many points to &s;ettle; he has propo&s;ed a compromi&s;e, that you, my &s;i&s;ter, ought to know, becau&s;e it nearly con|cerns you.&mdash;Me! brother William; pray ex|plain your&s;elf.&mdash;Why, he propo&s;es that, in lieu of arrears and, other expectations, my fa|ther &s;hall give his dear Emma to the heir of Lovel, in full of all demands.&mdash;She changed colour.&mdash;Holy Mary! &s;aid &s;he; and does my father agree to this propo&s;al? He is not very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to it; but Sir Robert refu&s;es his con|&s;ent: However, I have given him my intere&s;t with you.&mdash;Have you indeed? What! a &s;tranger, perhaps an impo&s;tor, who comes to turn us out of our dwelling?&mdash;Have patience, my Emma! &s;ee this young man without pre|judice, and perhaps you will like him as well
<PB N="180" REF="032742_0179_0FF50ED597830330">
as I do.&mdash;I am &s;urprized at you, William!&mdash;Dear Emma, I cannot bear to &s;ee you unea&s;y. Think of the man who of all others you would wi&s;h to &s;ee in a &s;ituation to a&s;k you of your father, and expect to &s;ee your wi&s;hes realized.&mdash;Impo&s;&s;ible! &s;aid &s;he!&mdash;Nothing is impo&s;|&s;ible, my dear: let us be prudent and all will end happily. You mu&s;t help me to receive and entertain the&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners. I expect a very &s;olemn &s;cene; but when that is once got over, happier hours than the pa&s;t will &s;uc|ceed. We &s;hall fir&s;t vi&s;it the haunted apart|ment; you, my &s;i&s;ter, will keep in your own till I &s;hall &s;end for you. I go now to give or|ders to the &s;ervants. He went and ordered them to be in waiting; and him&s;elf and his younge&s;t brother, &s;tood in readine&s;s to receive them.</P>
<P>The &s;ound of the horn announced the ar|rival of the commi&s;&s;ioners; at the &s;ame in&s;tant a &s;udden gu&s;t of wind aro&s;e, and the outward gates flew open. They entered the court|yard, and the great folding-doors into the hall were opened without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The mo|ment Edmund entered the hall, every door in the hou&s;e flew open; the &s;ervants all ru&s;h|ed into the hall, and fear was written on their countenances; Jo&s;eph only was undaunted.&mdash;The&s;e doors, &s;aid he, open of their own accord to receive their ma&s;ter! this is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in|deed!

<PB N="181" REF="032742_0180_0FF50EE6532C8DD8">
let us fini&s;h the work of fate! I will lead the way. He went on to the apartment, follow|ed by all pre&s;ent.&mdash;Open the &s;hutters, &s;aid he, the day-light &s;hall no longer be excluded here; the deeds of darkne&s;s &s;hall now be brought to light.</P>
<P>They de&s;cended the &s;tair-ca&s;e; every door was open, till they came to the fatal clo&s;et. Edmund called to Mr. William:&mdash;Approach, my friend, and behold the door your family overlooked! They came forward; he drew the key out of his bo&s;om, and unlocked the door; he made them ob&s;erve that the boards were all loo&s;e; he then called to his &s;ervants, and bid them remove every thing out of the clo&s;et. While they were doing this, Edmund &s;hewed them the brea&s;t-plate all &s;tained with blood; he then called to Jo&s;eph:&mdash;Do you know who&s;e was this &s;uit of armour?&mdash;It was my Lord's, &s;aid Jo&s;eph; the late Lord Lovel; I have &s;een him wear it.</P>
<P>Edmund bade them bring &s;hovels and re|move the earth. While they were gone, he de&s;ired O&s;wald to repeat all that had pa&s;&s;ed the night they &s;at up together in that apart|ment, which he did till the &s;ervants returned. They threw out the earth, while the by &s;tan|ders in &s;olemn &s;ilence waited the event. Af|ter &s;ome time and labour they &s;truck again&s;t &s;omething. They proceeded till they di&s;co|vered a large trunk, which with &s;ome difficul|ty they drew out. It had been corded round,
<PB N="182" REF="032742_0181_0FF50EF6BADCD130">
but the cords were rotted to du&s;t. They o|pened it, and found a &s;keleton, which appear|ed to have been tied neck and heels together, and forced into the trunk.&mdash;Behold, &s;aid Ed|mund, the bones of him to whom I owe my birth! The prie&s;t from Lord Graham's ad|vanced.&mdash;This is undoubtedly the body of Lord Lovel; I heard his kin&s;man confe&s;s the manner in which he was interred. Let this awful &s;pectacle be a le&s;&s;on to all pre&s;ent, that though wickedne&s;s may triumph for a &s;ea&s;on, a day of retribution will come! O&s;wald ex|claimed,&mdash;Behold the day of retribution! of triumph to the innocent, of &s;hame and confu|&s;ion to the wicked.</P>
<P>The young gentlemen declared that Ed|mund had made good his a&s;&s;ertions; what then, &s;aid they, remains? I propo&s;e, &s;aid Lord Graham's prie&s;t, that an account be written of this di&s;covery, and &s;igned by all the witne&s;&s;es pre&s;ent; that an atte&s;ted copy be le&s;t in the hands of this gentleman, and the original be &s;ent to the Barons and Sir Philip Harclay, to convince them of the truth of it.</P>
<P>Mr. Clifford then de&s;ired Edmund to pro|ceed in his own way.&mdash;The fir&s;t thing I pro|pro&s;e to do, &s;aid he, is to have a coffin made for the&s;e honoured remains; I tru&s;t to find the bones of my other p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ent, and to inter them all together in con&s;ecrated ground. Un|fortunate pair! you &s;hall at la&s;t re&s;t together! your &s;on &s;hall pay the la&s;t duties to your a&s;hes! He &s;topped to &s;hed tears, and none pre&s;ent
<PB N="183" REF="032742_0182_0FF50EFB5B238668">
but paid this tribute to their misfortunes. Ed|mund recovered his voice and proceeded&mdash;My next reque&s;t is, that Father O&s;wald and this reverend father, with whoever el&s;e the gentlemen &s;hall appoint, will &s;end for Andrew and Margery Twyford, and examine them concerning the circum&s;tances of my birth, and the death and burial of my unfortunate mother.&mdash;It &s;hall be done, &s;aid Mr. William; but fir&s;t let me entreat you to come with me and take &s;ome refre&s;hment after your journey, for you mu&s;t be fatigued: after dinner we will proceed in the inquiry.</P>
<P>They all followed him into the great hall, where they were entertained with great ho&s;|pitality, and Mr. William did the honours in his father's name. Edmund's heart was deep|ly affected, and the &s;olemnity of his deport|ment bore witne&s;s to his &s;incerity; but it was a manly &s;orrow, that did not make him ne|glect his duty to his friends or him&s;elf. He inquired after the health of the Lady Emma.&mdash;She is well, &s;aid William; and as much your friend as ever. Edmund bowed in &s;i|lence.</P>
<P>After dinner the commi&s;&s;ioners &s;ent for An|drew and his wife, and examined them &s;epa|rately, and found their accounts agreed toge|ther and were in &s;ub&s;tance the &s;ame as O&s;wald and Edmund had before related, &s;eparately al&s;o. The commi&s;&s;ioners ob&s;erved, that there could be no collu&s;ion between them, and that the proofs were indi&s;putable. They kept the
<PB N="184" REF="032742_0183_0FF50F04D05BBA98">
fo&s;ter parents all night; and the next day An|drew directed them to the place where the La|dy Lovel was buried, between two trees which he had marked for a memorial. They col|lected the bones and carried them to the Ca&s;|tle, where Edmund cau&s;ed a &s;tately coffin to be made for the remains of the unfortunate pair. The two prie&s;ts obtained leave to look in the coffin buried in the church, and found nothing but &s;tones and earth in it. The com|mi&s;&s;ioners then declared they were fully &s;ati&s;|fied of the reality of Edmund's preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>The two prie&s;ts were employed in drawing up a circum&s;tantial account of the&s;e di&s;cove|ries, in order to make their report to the Ba|rons at their return. In the mean time Mr. William took an opportunity to introduce Ed|mund to his &s;i&s;ter.&mdash;My Emma, &s;aid he, the heir of Lovel is de&s;irous to pay his re&s;pects to you. They were both in apparent confu&s;ion; but Edmund's wore off, and Emma's increa&s;|ed.&mdash;I have been long de&s;irous, &s;aid he, to pay my re&s;pects to the Lady whom I mo&s;t honour, but unavoidable duties have detained me; when the&s;e are fully paid, it is my wi&s;h to de|vote the remainder of my life to Lady Emma!&mdash;Are you, then, the heir of Lovel?&mdash;I am, Madam; and am al&s;o the man in who&s;e be|half I once pre&s;umed to &s;peak.&mdash;'Tis very &s;trange indeed!&mdash;It is &s;o, Madam, to my&s;elf; but time, that reconciles us to all things, will I hope, render this change in my &s;ituation fa|miliar to you. William &s;aid,&mdash;You are both
<PB N="185" REF="032742_0184_0FF50F096F3AA708">
well acquainted with the wi&s;hes of my heart; but my advice is, that you do not encourage a farther intimacy till my Lord's determina|tion be fully known.&mdash;You may di&s;po&s;e of me as you plea&s;e, &s;aid Edmund; but I can|not help declaring my wi&s;hes; yet I will &s;ub|mit to my Lord's &s;entence, though he &s;hould doom me to de&s;pair.</P>
<P>From this period, the young pair behaved with &s;olemn re&s;pect to each other, but with apparent re&s;erve. The young Lady &s;ometimes appeared in company, but oftner cho&s;e to be in her own apartment, where &s;he began to believe and hope for the completion of her wi&s;hes. The uncertainty of the Baron's de|termination, threw an air of anxiety over Ed|mund's face: his friend William, by the mo&s;t tender care and attention, &s;trove to di&s;pel his fears, and encourage his hopes; but he wait|ed with impatience for the return of the com|mi&s;&s;ioners, and the deci&s;ion of his fate.</P>
<P>While the&s;e things pa&s;&s;ed at the Ca&s;tle of Lovel, the nominal Baron recovered his health and &s;trength at the hou&s;e of Lord Clifford: In the &s;ame proportion he grew more &s;hy and re&s;erved, avoided the company of his brother and nephew, and was frequently &s;hut up with his two &s;ervants. Sir Robert Fitz-Owen made &s;everal attempts to gain his confidence, but in vain; he was equally &s;hy to him as the re&s;t. M. Zadi&s;ky ob&s;erved his motions with the penetration for which his countrymen have
<PB N="186" REF="032742_0185_0FF50F277B5C74F8">
been di&s;tingui&s;hed in all ages: He commu|nicated his &s;u&s;picions to Sir Philip and the Ba|rons, giving it as his opinion, that the crimi|nal was meditating an e&s;cape. They a&s;ked, what he thought was to be done? Zadi&s;ky offered to watch him in turn with another per|&s;on, and to lie in wait for him: he al&s;o pro|po&s;ed, that hor&s;es &s;hould be kept in readine&s;s, and men to mount them, without knowledge of the &s;ervice they were to be employed in. The Barons agreed to leave the whole manage|ment of this affair to Zadi&s;ky. He took his mea&s;ures &s;o well, that he intercepted the three fugitives in the fields adjoining to the hou&s;e, and brought them all pri&s;oners. They con|fined them &s;eparately, while the Lords and gentlemen con&s;ulted how to di&s;po&s;e of them.</P>
<P>Sir Philip applied to Lord Fitz-Owen, who begged leave to be &s;ilent: I have nothing, &s;aid he, to offer in favour of this bad man; and I cannot propo&s;e har&s;her mea&s;ures with &s;o near a relation. Zadi&s;ky then begged to be heard. You can no longer have any re|liance upon the word of a man who has for|feited all preten&s;ions to honour and &s;incerity. I have long wi&s;hed to revi&s;it once more my native country, and to inquire after &s;ome ve|ry dear friends I left there: I will undertake to convey this man to a very di&s;tant part of the world, where it will be out of his power to do further mi&s;chief, and free his relations from an ungrateful charge, unle&s;s you &s;hould rather chu&s;e to bring him to puni&s;hment here.
<PB N="187" REF="032742_0186_0FF50F2AAB0EEB30">
Lord Clifford approved of the propo&s;al; Lord Fitz-Owen remained &s;ilent, but &s;hewed no marks of di&s;approbation.</P>
<P>Sir Philip objected to parting with his friend; but Zadi&s;ky a&s;&s;ured him he had particular rea&s;ons for returning to the Holy Land, of which he &s;hould be judge hereafter. Sir Phi|lip de&s;ired the Lord Fitz-Owen to give him his company to the criminal's apartment, &s;ay|ing, we will have one more conver&s;ation with him, and that &s;hall decide his fate. They found him &s;ilent and &s;ullen, and he refu&s;ed to an&s;wer their que&s;tions.&mdash;Sir Philip then be|&s;poke him&mdash;After the proofs you have given of your fal&s;ehood and in&s;incerity, we can no longer have any reliance upon you, nor faith in your fulfilling the conditions of our agree|ment; I will therefore, once more make you a propo&s;al that &s;hall &s;till leave you indebted to our clemency. You &s;hall bani&s;h your&s;elf from England for ever, and go in pilgrimage to the Holy Land, with &s;uch companions as we &s;hall appoint; or &s;econdly, you &s;hall enter directly into a mona&s;tery, and there be &s;hut up for life; or, thirdly if you refu&s;e both the&s;e offers, I will go directly to Court, and throw my&s;elf at the feet of my Sovereign, relate the whole &s;tory of your wicked life and actions, and de|mand vengeance upon your head. The King is too good and pious to let &s;uch villainy go unpuni&s;hed; he will bring you to public &s;hame and puni&s;hment: And be you a&s;&s;ured, if I begin this pro&s;ecution, I will pur&s;ue it to the

I wait your an&s;wer one hour, and the next I put in execution whatever you &s;hall oblige me to determine. So &s;aying, they retired, and left him to reflect and to re&s;olve. At the ex|piration of the hour they &s;ent Zadi&s;ky to re|ceive his an&s;wer; he in&s;inuated to him the genero&s;ity and charity of Sir Philip and the Lords, and the certainty of their re&s;olutions, and begged him to take care what an&s;wer he returned, for that his fate depended on it. He kept &s;ilent &s;everal minutes, re&s;entment and de&s;pair were painted on his vi&s;age; at length <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;poke:</P>

<P>Zadi&s;ky went and made his report, and then &s;et immediately about his preparations. He cho&s;e two active young men for his attend|ants; and gave them directions to keep a &s;trict eye upon their charge, for that they &s;hould be accountable if he &s;hould e&s;cape them.</P>

In the mean time the Baron Fitz-Owen had &s;everal conferences with his brother: he en|deavoured to make him &s;en&s;ible of his crimes, and of the ju&s;tice and clemency of his con|queror; but he was moody and re&s;erved to him as to the re&s;t. Sir Philip Harclay oblig|ed him to &s;urrender his worldly e&s;tates into the hands of Lord Fitz-Owen: A writing was drawn up for that purpo&s;e, and executed in the pre&s;ence of them all. Lord Fitz-Owen engaged to allow him an annual &s;um, and to advance money for the expences of his voyage. He &s;poke to him in the mo&s;t affectionate man|ner, but he refu&s;ed his embrace:&mdash;You will have nothing to regret, &s;aid he, haughtily; for the gain is yours. Sir Philip conjured Zadi&s;ky to return to him again; who an&s;wer|ed,&mdash;I will either return, or give &s;uch rea&s;ons for my &s;tay, as you &s;hall approve.

&s;ea-port, where they heard of a &s;hip bound for the Levant, in which they embarked and proceeded on their voyage.</P>
<P>The commi&s;&s;ioners arrived at Lord Clif|ford's a few days after the departure of the adventurers. They gave a minute account of their commi&s;&s;ion, and expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves entirely &s;atisfied of the ju&s;tice of Edmund's preten&s;ions; they gave an account in writing of all that they had been eye-witne&s;&s;es to, and ventured to urge the Baron Fitz-Owen on the &s;ubject of Edmund's wi&s;hes. The Baron was already di&s;po&s;ed in his favour; his mind was employed in the future e&s;tabli&s;hment of his fa|mily. During their re&s;idence at Lord Clif|ford's, his elde&s;t &s;on Sir Robert had ca&s;t his eye upon the elde&s;t daughter of that nobleman, and he be&s;ought his father to a&s;k her in mar|riage for him. The Baron was plea&s;ed with the alliance, and took the fir&s;t opportunity to mention it to Lord Clifford; who an&s;wered him plea&s;antly,&mdash;I will give my daughter to your &s;on, upon condition that you will give yours to the heir of Lovel. The Baron look|ed &s;erious: Lord Clifford went on&mdash;I like that young man &s;o well, that I would accept him for a &s;on-in-law, if he a&s;ked me for my daughter: and if I have any influence with you, I will u&s;e it in his behalf.&mdash;A powerful &s;olicitor indeed! &s;aid the Baron; but you know my elde&s;t &s;on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> reluctance to it; if he con&s;ents, &s;o will I.&mdash;He &s;hall con&s;ent, &s;aid Lord Clifford, or he &s;hall have no daughter

of mine. Let him &s;ubdue his prejudices, and then I will lay a&s;ide my &s;cruples.&mdash;But, my Lord, replied the Baron, if I can obtain his free con&s;ent, it will be the be&s;t for all: I will try once more, and if he will not, I will leave it wholly to your management.</P>
<P>When the noble company were all a&s;&s;em|bled, Sir Philip Harclay revived the &s;ubject, and be&s;ought the Lord Fitz-Owen to put an end to the work he had begun, by confirming Edmund's happine&s;s. The Baron ro&s;e up and thus &s;poke:&mdash;The proofs of Edmund's noble birth, the &s;till &s;tronger ones of his excellent endowments and qualities, the &s;olicitations of &s;o many noble friends in his behalf, have al|together determined me in his favour; and I hope to do ju&s;tice to his merit, without detri|ment to my other children: I am re&s;olved to make them all as happy as my power will al|low me to do. Lord Clifford has been &s;o gracious to promi&s;e his fair daughter to my &s;on Robert, upon certain conditions, that I will take upon me to ratify, and which will render my &s;on worthy of the happine&s;s that awaits him. My children are the undoubted heirs of my unhappy brother, Lovel; you, my &s;on, &s;hall therefore immediately take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your Uncle's hou&s;e and e&s;tate, only oblig|ing you to pay to each of your younger bro|thers the &s;um of one thou&s;and pounds; on this condition, I will &s;ecure that e&s;tate to you and your heirs for ever. I will, by my own act and deed, &s;urrender the Ca&s;tle and e&s;tate
<PB N="192" REF="032742_0191_0FF5099730FC2558">
of Lovel to the right owner, and at the &s;ame time marry him to my daughter. I will &s;ettle a proper allowance upon my two younger &s;ons, and di&s;po&s;e of what remains by a will and te&s;tament; and then I &s;hall have done all my bu&s;ine&s;s in this world, and &s;hall have no|thing to do but prepare for the next.</P>
<P>Oh, my father! &s;aid Sir Robert, I cannot bear your genero&s;ity; you would give away all to others, and re&s;erve nothing for your|&s;elf.&mdash;Not &s;o, my &s;on, &s;aid the Baron: I will repair my old ca&s;tle in Wales, and re&s;ide there. I will vi&s;it my children, and be vi&s;ited by them: I will enjoy their happine&s;s, and by that means increa&s;e my own; whether I look backwards or forwards, I &s;hall have nothing to do but rejoice, and be thankful to Hea|ven that has given me &s;o many ble&s;&s;ings; I &s;hall have the comfortable reflection of having di&s;charged my duties as a citizen, a hu&s;band, a father, a friend; and whenever I am &s;um|moned away from this world, I &s;hall die con|tent.</P>
<P>Sir Robert came forward with tears on his cheeks; he kneeled to his father&mdash;Be&s;t of pa|rents, and of men! &s;aid he; you have &s;ubdu|ed a heart that has been too refractory to your will: you have this day made me &s;en&s;ible how much I owe to your goodne&s;s and forbear|ance with me.

They embraced with tears on both &s;ides: The company ro&s;e, and congratu|lated both father and &s;on. The Baron pre&s;ent|ed his &s;on to Lord Clifford, who embraced him, and &s;aid,&mdash;You &s;hall have my daugh|ter, for I &s;ee that you de&s;erve her.</P>
<P>Sir Philip Harclay approached; the Baron gave his &s;on's hand to the knight: Love and re&s;pect that good man, &s;aid he; de&s;erve his friend&s;hip, and you will obtain it. Nothing but congratulations were heard on all &s;ides.</P>
<P>When the joy was in &s;ome degree reduced to compo&s;ure, Sir Philip propo&s;ed that they &s;hould begin to execute the &s;chemes of happi|ne&s;s they had planned. He propo&s;ed that my Lord Fitz-Owen &s;hould go with him to the Ca&s;tle of Lovel, and &s;ettle the family there. The Baron con&s;ented; and both together in|vited &s;uch of the company, as liked it, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> company them thither. It was agreed that a nephew of Lord Graham's, another of Lord Clifford's, two gentlemen, friends of Sir Phi|lip Harclay, and father O&s;wald, &s;hould be of the party; together with &s;everal of Sir Philip's dependants and dome&s;tics, and the attendants on the re&s;t. Lord Fitz-Owen gave orders for their &s;peedy departure. Lord Graham and his friends took leave of them, in order to return to his own home; but, before he went he en|gaged

<P>Lord Fitz-Owen promi&s;ed to return to the celebration of the marriage; in the mean time he ordered his &s;on to go and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Uncle's hou&s;e, and to &s;ettle his hou&s;ehold: He invited young Clifford and &s;ome other gentlemen, to go with him.

<P>Sir Philip Harclay and the Baron Fitz Ow|en with their friends and attendants, &s;et for|wards for the Ca&s;tle of Lovel; a &s;ervant went before at full &s;peed, to acquaint the family of their approach.

Mr. William, attended by a &s;erv|ant, rode forward to meet them; he de&s;ired Edmund to &s;tay and receive them. Edmund was under &s;ome difficulty with regard to his behaviour to the lovely Emma: a thou&s;and times his heart ro&s;e to his lips, as often he &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed his emotions; they both &s;ighed fre|quently,

&s;aid little, thought much, and wi&s;hed for the event. Ma&s;ter Walter was too young to partake of their anxieties, but he wi&s;hed for the arrival of his father to end them.</P>
<P>Mr. William's impatience &s;purred him on to meet his father; as &s;oon as he &s;aw him he rode up directly to him: My dear father, you are welcome home! &s;aid he.&mdash;I think not, Sir, &s;aid the Baron, and looked &s;erious.&mdash;Why &s;o, My Lord? &s;aid William.&mdash;Becau&s;e it is no longer mine but another man's home, an&s;wer|ed he, and I mu&s;t receive my welcome from him.&mdash;Meaning Edmund? &s;aid William.&mdash;Whom el&s;e can it be?&mdash;Ah, my Lord! he is your creature, your &s;ervant; he puts his fate in your hands, and will &s;ubmit to your plea|&s;ure in all things!&mdash;Why comes he not to meet us? &s;aid the Baron.&mdash;His fears prevent him, &s;aid William; but &s;peak the word and I will fetch him.&mdash;No, &s;aid the Baron, we will wait on him.&mdash;William looked confu&s;ed: Is Edmund &s;o unfortunate, &s;aid he, as to have in|curred your di&s;plea&s;ure? Sir Philip Harclay advanced and laid his hand on William's &s;addle.&mdash;Generous impatience! noble youth! &s;aid he; look round you, and &s;ee if you can di&s;cover in this company one enemy of your friend! Leave to your excellent father the time and manner of explaining him&s;elf; he only can do ju&s;tice to his own &s;entiments. The Baron &s;miled on Sir Philip: William's coun|tenance cleared up; they went forward and &s;oon arrived at the ca&s;tle of Lovel.</P>

Edmund was walking to and fro in the hall, when he heard the horn that announced their arrival; his emotions were &s;o great that he could hardly &s;upport them. The Baron and Sir Philip entered the hall hand in hand; Ed|mund threw him&s;elf at their feet, and embra|ced their knees, but could not utter a word. They rai&s;ed him between them, and &s;trove to encourage him: but he threw him&s;elf into the arms of Sir Philip Harclay, deprived of &s;trength and almo&s;t of life. They &s;upported him to a &s;eat, where he recovered by degrees, but had no power to &s;peak his feelings; he looked up to his benefactors in the mo&s;t affec|ting manner, he laid his hand upon his bo&s;om, but was &s;till &s;ilent.

be&s;t. The Baron embraced him with the greate&s;t affection: Look round you, &s;aid he, and &s;alute your friends; the&s;e gentlemen came hither to do you honour. Edmund revived, he embraced and welcomed the gentlemen, Father O&s;wald received his embrace with pe|culiar affection, and gave him his benediction in a mo&s;t affecting manner. Edmund exclaim|ed&mdash;Pray for me, father! that I may bear all the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings with gratitude and moderation!

<P>The Baron took Edmund's hands in his own: Let us retire from this crowd, &s;aid he; we have bu&s;ine&s;s of a more private nature to tran&s;act.

Edmund at|tended in per&s;on as chief mourner, Sir Philip Harclay as the &s;econd; Jo&s;eph de&s;ired he might a&s;&s;i&s;t as &s;ervant to the decea&s;ed: They were followed by mo&s;t of the people of the vil|lage. The &s;tory was now become public, and every one ble&s;&s;ed Edmund for the piety and devotion with which he performed the la&s;t du|ties to his parents.&mdash;Edmund appeared in deep mourning: the week after, he a&s;&s;i&s;ted at a ma&s;s for the repo&s;e of the decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Sir Philip Harclay ordered a monument to be erected to the memory of his friends, with the following in&s;cription:</P>
<P><Q>Praye for the &s;oules of Arthur Lord Lo|vele and Marie his wife, who were cut off in the flowere of theire youthe, by the tre|cherye and crueltie of theire neare kinne&s;|manne.

<P>The Sunday after the funeral, Edmund threw off his mourning, and appeared in a dre&s;s &s;uitable to his condition. He received the compliments of his friends with ea&s;e and cheerfulne&s;s, and began to enjoy his happine&s;s. He a&s;ked an audience of his fair mi&s;tre&s;s, and was permitted to declare the pa&s;&s;ion he had &s;o long &s;tifled in his own bo&s;om. She gave him a favourable hearing, and in a &s;hort time confe&s;&s;ed that &s;he had &s;uffered equally in that &s;u&s;pence that was &s;o grievous to him. They engaged them&s;elves by mutual vows to each other, and only waited the Baron's plea&s;ure to complete their happine&s;s; every cloud was vani&s;hed from their brows, and &s;weet tranquil|ity took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their bo&s;oms. Their friends &s;hared their happine&s;s; William and Edmund renewed their vows of everla&s;ting friend&s;hip, and promi&s;ed to be as much toge|ther as William's other duties would permit.</P>
<P>The Baron once more &s;ummoned all his company together; he told Edmund all that had pa&s;&s;ed relating to his brother-in-law, his exile, and the pilgrimage of Zadi&s;ky; he then related the circum&s;tances of Sir Robert's en|gagement to Lord Clifford's daughter, his e&s;|tabli&s;hment in his Uncle's &s;eat, and his own obligations to return time enough to be pre|&s;ent

at the marriage: But before I go, &s;aid he, I will give my daughter to the heir of Lo|vel, and then I &s;hall have di&s;charged my duty to him and my promi&s;e to Sir Philip Harc|lay.</P>
<P>You have nobly performed both, &s;aid Sir Philip, and whenever you depart I &s;hall be your companion.&mdash;What, &s;aid Edmund, am I to be deprived of both my fathers at once? My honoured Lord, you have given away two hou&s;es, where do you intend to re&s;ide?&mdash;No matter, &s;aid the Baron; I know I &s;hall be welcome to both.&mdash;My dear lord, &s;aid Edmund, &s;tay here and be &s;till the Ma&s;ter; I &s;hall be proud to be under your command, and to be your &s;ervant as well as your &s;on!&mdash;No, Edmund, &s;aid the Baron, that would not now be proper; this is your ca&s;tle, you are its Lord and Ma&s;ter, and it is incumbent on you to &s;hew your&s;elf worthy of the great things Providence hath done for you.&mdash;How &s;hall I, a young man, acquit my&s;elf of &s;o ma|ny duties as will be upon me, without the ad|vice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of my two paternal friends?

They embraced with tears of affection, and Edmund was all joy and grati|tude. My good Lord, &s;aid Sir Philip, you

The Baron caught Sir Philip's hand&mdash;Noble Sir, I thank you, and I will embrace your kind offer; I will be your tenant for the pre|&s;ent; my ca&s;tle in Wales &s;hall be put in repair, in the mean time; if I do not re&s;ide there, it will be an e&s;tabli&s;hment for one of my young|er &s;ons: But what will you do with your old &s;oldiers and dependants?&mdash;My Lord, I will never ca&s;t them off. There is another hou&s;e on my e&s;tate that has been &s;hut up many years; I will have it repaired and furni&s;hed properly for the reception of my old men: I will endow it with a certain &s;um to be paid annually, and will appoint a &s;teward to man|age their revenue; I will continue it dur|ing the lives of the fir&s;t inhabitants, and af|ter that I &s;hall leave it to my &s;on here, to do as he plea&s;es.&mdash;Your &s;on, &s;aid Edmund, will make it the bu&s;ine&s;s of his life to act worthy of &s;uch a father.&mdash;Enough, &s;aid Sir Philip, I am &s;atisfied that you will.

I will be attended by my own &s;ervants; and, whenever you de&s;ire it, I will give you my company; your joys, your griefs &s;hall be

I will hope to &s;ee you &s;ometimes, and to claim a &s;hare in your ble&s;&s;ings. But let us give no more tears to &s;orrow, the re&s;t &s;hall be joy and tran&s;port. The fir&s;t &s;tep we &s;hall take &s;hall be to marry our Edmund; I will give orders for the celebration, and they &s;hall be the la&s;t or|ders I &s;hall give in this hou&s;e. They then &s;e|parated, and went to prepare for the approach|ing &s;olemnity.</P>
<P>Sir Philip and the Baron had a private con|ference concerning Edmund's a&s;&s;uming the name and title of Lovel. I am re&s;olved, &s;aid Sir Philip, to go to the King; to acquaint him briefly with Edmund's hi&s;tory; I will reque&s;t that he may be called up to parliament by a writ, for there is no need of a new patent, he being the true inheritor; in the mean time he &s;hall a&s;&s;ume the name, arms, and title, and I will an&s;wer any one that &s;hall di&s;pute his right to them. Sir Philip then declared his re&s;olu|tion to &s;et out with the Baron at his departure, and to &s;ettle all his other affairs before he re|turned to take up his re&s;idence at the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>A few days after, the marriage was celebra|ted, to the entire &s;atisfaction of all parties. The
<PB N="206" REF="032742_0205_0FF50D83235B3D30">
Baron ordered the doors to be thrown open, and the hou&s;e free for all comers; with every token of joy and fe&s;tivity. Edmund appeared full of joy without levity, and of mirth with|out extravagance; he received the congratu|lations of his friends, with ea&s;e, freedom, and vivacity. He &s;ent for his fo&s;ter father and mother, who began to think them&s;elves ne|glected, as he had been &s;o deeply engaged in affairs of more con&s;equence, that he had not been particularly attentive to them; he made them come into the great hall, and pre&s;ented them to his Lady.</P>
<P>The&s;e, &s;aid he, are the good people to whom I am, under God, indebted for my pre&s;ent happine&s;s; they were my fir&s;t benefactors; I was obliged to them for food and &s;u&s;tenance in my childhood, and this good woman nour|i&s;hed my infancy at her own brea&s;t. The La|dy received them graciou&s;ly, and &s;aluted Mar|gery. Andrew kneeled down, and, with great humility, begged Edmund's pardon for his treatment of him in his childhood. I heartily forgive you, &s;aid he, and I will excu&s;e you to your&s;elf; it was natural for you to look upon me as an intruder, that was eating your chil|dren's bread; you &s;aved my life, and after|wards you &s;u&s;tained it by your food and rai|ment: I ought to have maintained my&s;elf, and to have contributed to your maintenance. But, be&s;ides this, your treatment of me was the fir&s;t of my preferment; it recommended me to the notice of this noble family: Every thing th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">
<PB N="207" REF="032742_0206_0FF50D93984D2930">
happened to me &s;ince, has been a &s;tep to my pre|&s;ent &s;tate of honour and happine&s;s. Never man had &s;o many benefactors as my&s;elf; but both they, and my&s;elf, have been only in&s;tru|ments in the hands of Providence, to bring a|bout its own purpo&s;es: Let us prai&s;e God for all! I &s;hared your poverty and you &s;hall &s;hare my riches; I will give you the cottage where you dwell, and the ground about it; I will al|&s;o pay you the annual &s;um of ten pounds for the lives of you both; I will put out your children to manual trades, and a&s;&s;i&s;t you to provide for them in their own &s;tation; and you are to look upon this as paying a debt and not be|&s;towing a gift: I owe you more than I can e|ver pay: and, if there be any thing further in my power that will contribute to your happi|ne&s;s, you can a&s;k nothing in rea&s;on that I will deny you.</P>
<P>Andrew hid his face: I cannot bear it! &s;aid he: Oh what a brute was I, to &s;uch a child as this! I &s;hall never forgive my&s;elf!&mdash;You mu&s;t indeed, my friend, for I forgive and thank you. Andrew retired back, but Margery came for|ward; &s;he looked earne&s;tly on Edmund, &s;he then threw her arms about his neck, and wept aloud&mdash;My precious child! my lovely babe! thank God, I have lived to &s;ee this day! I will rejoice in your good fortune, and your bounty to us, but, I mu&s;t a&s;k one more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">avour yet; that I may &s;ometimes come hither and behold that gracious coun|tenance, and thank God that I was ho|noured

&s;o far as to give thee food from my own brea&s;t, and to bring thee up to be a ble&s;|&s;ing to me, and to all that know thee! Edmund was affected, he returned her embrace; he bade her come to the Ca&s;tle as often as &s;he plea&s;ed, and &s;he &s;hould always be received as his mother; the bride &s;aluted her, and told her the oftener &s;he came, the more welcome &s;he &s;hould be. Margery and her hu&s;band re|tired, full of ble&s;&s;ings and prayers for their hap|pine&s;s; &s;he gave vent to her joy, by relating to the &s;ervants and neighbours every circum|&s;tance of Edmund's birth, infancy, and child|hood: Many a tear was dropped by the audi|tors, and many a prayer wafted to Heaven for his happine&s;s. Jo&s;eph took up the &s;tory where &s;he left it; he told the ri&s;ing dawn of youth and virtue, darting its rays through the clouds of ob&s;curity, and how every &s;troke of envy and malignity bru&s;hed away &s;ome part of the dark|ne&s;s that veiled its lu&s;tre: He told the &s;tory of the haunted apartment, and all the con&s;equen|ces of it; how he and O&s;wald conveyed the youth away from the ca&s;tle, no more to re|turn till he came as ma&s;ter of it: he clo&s;ed the tale with prai&s;e to heaven for the happy di&s;co|very, that gave &s;uch an heir to the hou&s;e of Lovel; to his dependants &s;uch a Lord and Ma&s;ter; to mankind a friend and benefactor. There was truly a hou&s;e of joy; not that fal&s;e kind, in the mid&s;t of which there is heavine&s;s, but that of rational creatures, grateful to the &s;upreme benefactor, rai&s;ing their minds, by a
<PB N="209" REF="032742_0208_0FF50DB8EC19BBE0">
due enjoyment of earthly ble&s;&s;ings, to a prepa|ration for a more perfect &s;tate hereafter.</P>
<P>A few days after the wedding, the Lord Fitz-Owen began to prepare for his journey to the north. He gave to Edmund the plate, linen, and furniture of the Ca&s;tle, the farming &s;tock and uten&s;ils: he would have added a &s;um of money, but Sir Philip &s;topped his hand:&mdash;We do not forget, &s;aid he, that you have other children, we will not &s;uffer you to injure them; give us your ble&s;&s;ing and paternal affection, and we have nothing more to a&s;k:&mdash;I told you, my Lord, that you and I &s;hould one day be &s;incere friends.&mdash;We mu&s;t be &s;o, an&s;wered the Baron; it is impo&s;&s;ible to be long your e|nemy: We are brothers, and &s;hall be to our lives end.</P>
<P>They regulated the young man's hou&s;ehold; the Baron gave leave to the &s;ervants to choo&s;e their ma&s;ter; the elder ones followed him (ex|cept Jo&s;eph, who de&s;ired to live with Edmund, as the chief happine&s;s of his life;) mo&s;t of the younger ones cho&s;e the &s;ervice of the youthful pair. There was a tender and affec|tionate parting on all &s;ides. Edmund be|&s;ought his beloved William not to leave him. The Baron &s;aid, he mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t on his being at his brother's wedding, as a due attention to him; but after that he &s;hould return to the Ca&s;tle for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>The Baron and Sir Philip Harclay, with their train &s;et forward. Sir Philip went to
<PB N="210" REF="032742_0209_0FF50DCA5BFCDB20">
London and obtained all he de&s;ired for his Edmund; from thence he went into York&s;hire, and &s;ettled his affairs there, removing his pen|&s;ioners to his other hou&s;e, and putting Lord Fitz-Owen in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his own. They had a generous contention about the terms; but Sir Philip in&s;i&s;ted on the Baron's accepting the u&s;e of every thing there: You hold it in tru&s;t for a future grand-child, &s;aid he, whom I hope to live to endow with it.</P>
<P>During Sir Philip's ab&s;ence, the young Lord Lovel cau&s;ed the haunted apartment to be repaired and furni&s;hed for the reception of his father by adoption. He placed his friend Jo&s;eph over all his men &s;ervants, and ordered him to forbear his attendance; but the old man would always &s;tand at the &s;ide-board, and fea&s;t his eyes with the countenance of his own ma&s;ter's &s;on, &s;urrounded with honour and happine&s;s. John Wyatt waited upon the per|&s;on of his Lord, and enjoyed his favour with|out abatement. Mr. William Fitz-Owen ac|companied Sir Philip Harclay from the north country, when he returned to take up his re|&s;idence at the Ca&s;tle of Lovel.</P>
<P>Edmund, in the arms of love and friend&s;hip, enjoyed with true reli&s;h the ble&s;&s;ings that &s;ur|rounded him, with an heart overflowing with benevolence to his fellow-creatures, and rap|tures of gratitude to his creator. His Lady and him&s;elf were examples of conjugal affec|tion and happine&s;s. Within a year from his marriage &s;he brought him forth a &s;on and heir,
<PB N="211" REF="032742_0210_0FF50DD7DF27BD10">
who&s;e birth renewed the joy and congratula|tions of all his friends: The Baron Fitz-Owen came to the bapti&s;m, and partook of his chil|dren's ble&s;&s;ings. The child was called Arthur, after the name of its grand-father.</P>
<P>The year following was born a &s;econd &s;on who was called Philip Harclay; upon him the noble Knight of that name &s;ettled his e&s;|tate in York&s;hire; and by the King's permi&s;|&s;ion, he took the name and arms of that fa|mily.</P>
<P>The third &s;on was called William; he in|herited the fortune of his uncle of that name, who adopted him, and made the Ca&s;tle of Lo|vel his re&s;idence, and died a bachelor.</P>
<P>The fourth &s;on was called Edmund; the fifth Owen; and there was al&s;o one daughter called Emma.</P>
<P>When time had worn out the prejudices of Sir Robert Fitz-Owen, the good old Baron of that name propo&s;ed a marriage between his elde&s;t &s;on and heir, and the daughter of Ed|mund Lord Lovel, which was happily conclu|ded. The nuptials were honoured with the pre&s;ence of both families; and the Old Baron was &s;o elevated with this happy union of his de&s;cendants, that he cried out&mdash;Now I am rea|dy to die! I have lived long enough! this is the band of love that unites all my children to me, and each other! he did not long &s;urvive this happy event; he died full of years and honours, and his name was never mentioned but with the deepe&s;t marks of gratitude, love
<PB N="212" REF="032742_0211_0FF50DF24754F400">
and veneration. Sweet is the remembrance of the virtuous, and happy are the de&s;cend|ants of &s;uch a father! they will think on him, and emulate his virtues; they will remember him, and be a&s;hamed to degenerate from their ance&s;tor.</P>
<P>Many years after Sir Philip Harclay &s;ettled at the Ca&s;tle he received tidings from his friend Zadi&s;ky, by one of the two &s;ervants who attended him to the Holy Land. From him he learned that his friend had di&s;covered, by private advices, that he had a &s;on living in Pale&s;tine, which was the chief motive of his leaving England; that he had met with vari|ous adventures in pur&s;uit of him; that at length he found him, converted him to the Chri&s;tian religion, and then per&s;uaded him to retire from the world into a mona&s;tery by the &s;ide of mount Libanus; where he intended to end his days.</P>
<P>That Walter, commonly called Lord Lovel, had entered into the &s;ervice of the Greek Emperor, John Paleologus, not bearing to un|dergo a life of &s;olitude and retirement; that he made up a &s;tory of his being compelled to leave his native country by his relations, for having accidentally killed one of them, and that he was treated with great cruelty and in|ju&s;tice; that he had accepted a po&s;t in the em|peror's army, and was &s;oon after married to the daughter of one of the chief officers of it.</P>
<P>Zadi&s;ky fore&s;aw, and lamented the down|fall of that empire, and withdrew from the
<PB N="213" REF="032742_0212_0FF50D4735C390A8">
&s;torm he &s;aw approaching. Finally, he bade the me&s;&s;enger tell Sir Philip Harclay and his a|dopted &s;on, that he &s;hould not cea&s;e to pray for them, and de&s;ire their prayers in return.</P>
<P>Sir Philip de&s;ired Lord Lovel to entertain this me&s;&s;enger in his &s;ervive. That good Knight lived to extreme old age in honour and happine&s;s, and died in the arms of his beloved Edmund: who al&s;o performed the la&s;t duties to his faithful Jo&s;eph.</P>
<P>Father O&s;wald lived many years in the fa|mily as chaplain; he retired from thence at length, and died in his own mona&s;tery.</P>
<P>Edmund Lord Lovel lived to old age, in peace, honour, and happine&s;s, and died in the arms of his children.</P>
<P>Sir Philip Harclay cau&s;ed the papers relat|ing to his &s;on's hi&s;tory to be collected toge|ther; the fir&s;t part was written under his own eye in York&s;hire, the &s;ub&s;equent parts by fa|ther O&s;wald at the Ca&s;tle of Lovel. All the&s;e, when together, furni&s;h a &s;triking le&s;&s;on to po&s;|terity, of the over-ruling hand of Providence, and the certainty of RETRIBUTION.</P>
