<P>THESE Words contain the ingenious Con|fe&s;&s;ion of King <HI>Agrippa;</HI> which having &s;ome reference to what went before, it may not be improper to relate to You the Sub&s;tance of the pre|ceding Ver&s;es, to which the&s;e Words are &s;o clo&s;ely connected.</P>
<P>THE Chapter then, out of which this Text is taken, contains an admirable Account the Great Saint <HI>Paul</HI> gave of his wonderful Conver&s;ion from <HI>Judai&s;m</HI> to <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> when he was called to make his Defence before <HI>Fe&s;tus</HI> and another <HI>Gentile</HI> Governor. Our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord had long &s;ince foretold, that, <HI>When the Son of Man &s;hould be lifted up, his Di&s;ciples &s;hould be brought before Kings for his Name's &s;ake, for a Te&s;timony unto them.</HI> And very good was the De&s;ign of Infinite Wi&s;dom in thus ordaining it: For Chri&s;tianity being from the very Beginning a Doctrine of the Cro&s;s, the Princes and Rulers of the Earth thought them&s;elves too high to be in&s;tructed by &s;uch mean Teachers, or too happy to be di&s;turbed by &s;uch unwelcome Truths:

and therefore would have always continued Strangers to <HI>JESUS CHRIST and him Crucified,</HI> had not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Apo&s;tles, by being arraigned as Criminals before them, gained Opportunities of Preaching to them <HI>JESUS and the Re&s;urrection.</HI> Saint <HI>Paul</HI> Knew full well that this was the main Rea&s;on, why his ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter per|mitted his Enemies at this Time to arraign him at a publick Bar: And therefore, in compliance with the Divine Will, thinks it not &s;ufficient barely to make his Defence, but endeavours at the &s;ame Time to convert, his Judges. And this He did with &s;uch Demon&s;tra|tion of the Spirit, and of Power, that <HI>Fe&s;tus,</HI> unwilling to be convinced by the &s;tronge&s;t Evidence, cries out with a loud Voice, <HI>Paul, much Learning doth make thee mad.</HI> To which the brave Apo&s;tle (like a true Fol|lower of the Holy JESUS) meekly replies, <HI>I am not mad, mo&s;t noble Fe&s;tus, but &s;peak forth the Words <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Truth and Soberne&s;s.</HI> But in all Probability &s;eeing King <HI>Agrippa</HI> more affected with his Di&s;cour&s;e, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ob&s;erving in him an Inclination to know the Truth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he applies him&s;elf more particularly to Him: <HI>The King,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>knoweth of the&s;e Things; before whom al&s;o I &s;peak freely; for I am per&s;uaded that none of the&s;e Things are hidden from him.</HI> And then, that if po&s;&s;ible he might compleat his wi&s;hed-for Conver&s;ion, he, with an inimitable Strain of Oratory, addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf &s;till more clo&s;ely,&mdash;<HI>King Agrippa, Believe&s;t thou the Prophets?

WHICH Words, taken with the Context, afford us a lively Repre&s;entation of the different Reception the Doctrine of CHRIST's Mini&s;ters, who come in the Power and Spirit of Saint <HI>Paul,</HI> meets with now-a-days in the Minds of Men. For notwith&s;tanding They like the Great Apo&s;tle, <HI>&s;peak forth the Words of Truth and Soberne&s;s;</HI> and with &s;uch Energy and Power, that <HI>all their Adver&s;aries cannot gain&s;ay or re&s;i&s;t:</HI> yet too many, with the mo&s;t Noble <HI>Fe&s;tus</HI> before mentioned, being, like him, either too proud to be taught, or too &s;en&s;ual, too carele&s;s, or too worldly-minded to live up to their Doctrine,&mdash;in order to excu&s;e them&s;elves cry out, that <HI>much Learning,</HI> much Study, or what is more un|accountable, much Piety, <HI>hath made them Mad.</HI> And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD! all do not thus di&s;believe our Report; yet among&s;t tho&s;e many others, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> receive the Word, and confe&s;s that we &s;peak the Words of Truth and Soberne&s;s, there are &s;o Few, who arrive at any higher Degree of Piety than that of <HI>Agrippa,</HI> or are any farther per&s;uaded than to be <HI>Almo&s;t Chri&s;tians,</HI>&mdash;that I cannot but think it highly nece&s;&s;ary to warn my dear Hearers of the Danger of &s;uch a State.

IV. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> I &s;hall conclude with a general Ex|hortation, to &s;et all upon &s;triving not only to be Almo&s;t but Altogether <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I. AND <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I am to con&s;ider What is meant by an <HI>Almo&s;t Chri&s;tian.</HI></P>
<P>AN <HI>Almo&s;t Chri&s;tian</HI> then, if we con&s;ider him in re|&s;pect to his Duty to GOD, is one that ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s between two Opinions, that wavers between CHRIST and the World; that would reconcile <HI>GOD and Mammom,</HI> that is, Light and Darkne&s;s, <HI>CHRIST and Belial.</HI> It is true, He has an Inclination to Religion, but then he is very cautious how he goes too far in it: His fal&s;e Heart is always crying out <HI>Spare thy&s;elf,</HI> Do thy&s;elf, no Harm. He prays indeed, that <HI>GOD's Will may be done on Earth as it is in Heaven:</HI> but then, notwith|&s;tanding He is very partial in his Obedience, and fondly hopes that GOD will not <HI>be extreme to mark every Thing that He</HI> wilfully <HI>does ami&s;s?</HI> though an in|&s;pired Apo&s;tle has told him, that He that wilfully <HI>offends in one Point is guilty of all.</HI> Above all He in one that depends much o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> outward Ordinances, and upon that Account looks upon him&s;elf as <HI>Righteous, and de&s;pi&s;es Others,</HI> though at the &s;ame Time he may be as great a Stranger to the Divine Life as any other Per&s;on what&s;oever. In &s;hort, he is fond of the <HI>Form</HI> but never experiences the <HI>Power of Godline&s;s</HI> in his Heart: He goes on Year after Year, feeling and attending on the Means of Grace; but then, like <HI>Ph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|roah's</HI> Lean Kine, is never the better, but rather the wor&s;e for them.</P>
<P>IF you con&s;ider Him in re&s;pect to his Neighbour. He is one that is ju&s;tly &s;trict to all, but then this
<PB N="9" REF="004446_0005_100D9D6067332418">
does not proceed from any Love to GOD or Regard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o Man, but only out of a Principle of Self-Love&punc; becau&s;e he knows Di&s;hone&s;ty will &s;poil his Reputa|tion, and con&s;equently hinder his Thriving in the World.</P>
<P>HE is one that depends much on being Negatively Good, and contents him&s;elf with the Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having done no one any Harm; though he reads in the Go&s;pel, that <HI>the Unprofitable Servant was ca&s;t into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uter Darkne&s;s,</HI> and the Barren Fig-Tree cur&s;ed and <HI>dried up</HI> from the Roots, not for bearing <HI>bad,</HI> but <HI>no</HI> Fruit.</P>
<P>HE is no Enemy to Charitable Contributions, if not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oo frequently recommended: But then he is quite un|acquainted with the kind Offices of <HI>Vi&s;iting the Sick and impri&s;oned, Clothing the Naked, and Relieving the Hun|gry.</HI> He thinks that the&s;e Things belong only to the Clergy, though his own fal&s;e Heart tells him, that nothing but Pride keeps him from exerci&s;ing the&s;e Acts of Humility, and that JESUS CHRIST, in the 15th Chapter of Saint <HI>Matthew,</HI> condemns Per&s;ons to everla&s;ting Puni&s;hment, not for being Fornicators, Drunkards, or Extortioners, but merely for neglecting the&s;e Charitable Offices. <HI>When the Son of Man,</HI> &s;ays our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord him&s;elf, <HI>&s;hall come in his Glory, He &s;hall &s;et the Sheep on his Right Hand, and the Goats on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">is Left. And then &s;hall He &s;ay unto them on his Left hand, Depart from me ye Cur&s;ed, into everla&s;ting Fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels! For I was an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ngred, and Ye gave me no Meat; I was thir&s;ty, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e gave me no Drink; I was a Stranger, and Ye took <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e not in; Naked and Ye Cloathed me not; Sick and in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ri&s;on, and Ye vi&s;ited me not. Then &s;hall They al&s;o &s;ay,
<PB N="10" REF="004446_0006_100D9D62009A6F28">
Lord, When &s;aw we Thee an hungred, or a thir&s;t, or a Stranger, or naked, or &s;ick, or in Pri&s;on, and did not mini&s;ter unto Thee? Then &s;hall be an&s;wer them, Verily I &s;ay unto you, Ina&s;much as Ye have not done it unto one of the lea&s;t of the&s;e my Brethren, ye did it not unto me: And the&s;e &s;hall go away into Everla&s;ting Puni&s;hment.</HI> I thought proper to give You this whole Pa&s;&s;age of Scripture at large, becau&s;e our Saviour lays &s;uch a par|ticualar Stre&s;s upon it; and yet notwith&s;tanding it is &s;o little regarded, that, were we to judge by the Prac|tice of <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> one &s;hould be tempted to think there were no &s;uch Ver&s;es in the BIBLE.</P>
<P>BUT, to proceed in our Character of an <HI>Almo&s;t Chri&s;tian:</HI> If we con&s;ider him in re&s;pect to Him&s;elf; as before we &s;aid he was &s;trictly hone&s;t to his Neigh|bour, &s;o he is likewi&s;e &s;trictly &s;ober in him&s;elf: But then both his Hone&s;ty and Sobriety proceed from the &s;ame Principle of a fal&s;e Self-love. It is true, He <HI>runs not into the &s;ame Exce&s;s of Riot</HI> with other Men; but then it is not out of Obedience to the Laws of GOD, but either becau&s;e his Con&s;titution will not away with Intemperance; or rather becau&s;e he is cautious of for|feiting his Reputation, or unfitting him&s;elf for temporal Bu&s;ine&s;s. But though he is &s;o Prudent as to avoid In|temperance and Exce&s;s, for the Rea&s;ons before men|tioned; yet he always goes to the Extremity of what is lawful. It is true, He is no Drunkard; but then he has no Chri&s;tian Self-denial to plead for him. He cannot think our Saviour to be &s;o au&s;tere a Ma&s;ter, as to deny us to indulge our&s;elves in &s;ome Particulars: And &s;o by this Means he is kept out of a Sen&s;e of true Religion, as much as if he had lived in Debauchery, or any other Crime whatever. As to &s;ettling his
<PB N="11" REF="004446_0006_100D9D62009A6F28">
Principles as well as Practice, He is guided more by the World than by the Word of GOD. As for his Part, he cannot think the Way to Heaven &s;o narrow as &s;ome would make it; and therefore con&s;iders not &s;o much what the Scripture requires, as what &s;uch and &s;uch a Man does, or what will be&s;t &s;uit his own cor|rupt Inclinations. Upon this account, he is not only very Cautious him&s;elf, but likewi&s;e very careful of young Converts, who&s;e Faces are &s;et Heavenward; and therefore is always acting the Devil's Part, and bidding them <HI>&s;pare them&s;elves,</HI> though they are doing no more than what the Scripture &s;trictly requires of them to do: The Con&s;equence of which is, that He &s;uffers not Him&s;elf to <HI>enter into the Kingdom of GOD, and They that are entering in he hinders.</HI></P>
<P>THUS lives the <HI>Almo&s;t Chri&s;tian:</HI> Not that I can &s;ay, I have fully de&s;cribed him to you; but from the&s;e Out-lines and Sketches of his Character, if your Con|&s;ciences have done their proper Offices, and made a particular Application of what has been &s;aid to your own Hearts, I cannot but fear that &s;ome of you may ob&s;erve &s;ome Features in his Picture, obious as it is, too near re&s;embling your own; and therefore cannot but hope, at the &s;ame Time, that you join with the Apo&s;tle in the Words immediately following the Text, and wi&s;h your&s;elves <HI>not only Almo&s;t, but Altogether Chri&s;tians.</HI></P>
<P>But it is Time for me to proceed to the <HI>Second Ge|neral Thing</HI> Propo&s;ed; namely, to Con&s;ider the Rea&s;ons why &s;o many are no more than Almo&s;t <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI></P>
<P>AND the fir&s;t Rea&s;on I &s;hall mention is, becau&s;e &s;o many &s;et out with fal&s;e Notions of Religion; and tho'
<PB N="12" REF="004446_0007_100D9D64CB561D68">
they live in a Chri&s;tian Country, yet know not what Chri&s;tianity is. This perhaps may be e&s;teemed a hard Saying, but Experience &s;adly evinces the Truth of it: For &s;ome place Religion in being of this or that Com|munion; more in Morality; mo&s;t in a round of Duties and a Model of Performances; and few, very few, acknowledge it to be, what is really is, a thorough, inward Change of Nature, a Divine Life, a Vital Par|ticipation of JESUS CHRIST, an Union of the Soul with GOD; which the Apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;es by &s;aying, <HI>He that is joined to the Lord is One Spirit.</HI> Hence it happens that &s;o many, even of the mo&s;t knowing Pro|fe&s;&s;ors, when you come to conver&s;e with them con|cerning the E&s;&s;ence, the Life, the Soul of Religion, I mean our <HI>New Birth in</HI> JESUS CHRIST, confe&s;s them|&s;elves quite ignorant of the Matter, and cry out with <HI>Nicodemus, How can this Thing be!</HI> And no wonder then, that &s;o many are only <HI>Almo&s;t Chri&s;tians,</HI> when &s;o many know not what <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> is: No marvel &s;o many take up with the <HI>Form,</HI> when they are quite Strangers to the <HI>Power of Godline&s;s;</HI> or content them|&s;elves with the Shadow, when they know &s;o little about the Sub&s;tance of it. And this is one Cau&s;e why &s;o many are <HI>Almo&s;t,</HI> why &s;o few are <HI>Altogether Chri&s;tians.</HI></P>
<P>A SECOND Rea&s;on that may be a&s;&s;igned why &s;o many are no more than <HI>Almo&s;t Chri&s;tians,</HI> is a &s;ervile Fear of Man: Multitudes there are, and have been, who though awakened to a Sen&s;e of the Divine Life, and <HI>have ta&s;ted and felt the Powers of the World to come;</HI> yet, out of a ba&s;e &s;inful Fear of being counted &s;ingular, or contemned by Men, have &s;uffered all tho&s;e good Impre&s;&s;ions to wear off again. It is true they
<PB N="13" REF="004446_0007_100D9D64CB561D68">
have &s;ome E&s;teem for JESUS CHRIST; but then, like <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> they would <HI>come</HI> to him only <HI>by Night:</HI> They are willing to &s;erve him; but then they would do it <HI>&s;ecretly for fear of the Jews:</HI> They have a mind to <HI>&s;ee JESUS,</HI> but then they cannot <HI>come to him becau&s;e of the Pre&s;s,</HI> for fear of being laugh'd at, and ridiculed by tho&s;e with whom they u&s;ed to &s;it at Meat. But well did our Saviour prophe&s;y of &s;uch Per&s;ons, <HI>How can ye love me which receive Honour one of another?</HI> Alas! have they never read, that <HI>the Friend&s;hip of this World is Enmity with GOD;</HI> and that our Lord him|&s;elf has threatned, <HI>Who&s;oever &s;hall be a&s;hamed of me or of my Words, in this wicked and adulterous Generation, of him &s;hall the Son of Man be a&s;hamed, when He cometh in the Glory of his Father and of his Holy Angels?</HI> But no wonder that &s;o many are no more than <HI>Almo&s;t Chri&s;tians,</HI> &s;ince &s;o many <HI>love the Prai&s;e of Men more than the Honour which cometh of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>A THIRD Rea&s;on why &s;o many are no more than <HI>Almo&s;t Chri&s;tians,</HI> is a reigning Love of Money. This was the pitiable Ca&s;e of that forward young Man in the Go&s;pel, who came running to our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord, and kneeling before him, enquired what <HI>He mu&s;t do to inherit Eternal Life;</HI> to which our Ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter re|plied, <HI>Thou knowe&s;t the Commandments, Do not Kill, Do not commit Adultery, Do not Steal:</HI> To which the Young Man replied (Oh that every Young Man here pre&s;ent could do &s;o too!) <HI>All the&s;e have I kept from my Youth.</HI> But when our Lord proceeded to tell him, <HI>Yet lacke&s;t thou One Thing, Go &s;ell all that thou ha&s;t and give to the Poor,&mdash;he was grieved at that Say|ing, and went away &s;orrowful, for he had great Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|ons!</HI> Poor Youth! He had a good Mind to be a
<PB N="14" REF="004446_0008_100D9D67544B2508">
<HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> and to inherit Eternal Life, but thought it too dear, if it could be purcha&s;ed at no le&s;s an Ex|pence than of his whole E&s;tate! And thus many, both Young and Old, now-a-days come running to wor&s;hip our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord in publick, and kneel before him in private, and enquire at his Go&s;pel, What they mu&s;t do to inherit Eternal Life: but when they find they mu&s;t renounce the Self-Enjoyment of Riches, and <HI>for&s;ake All</HI> in Affection, <HI>to follow Him,</HI> They cry, <HI>The LORD pardon us in this Thing!&mdash;We pray Thee, have us excu&s;ed.&mdash;</HI></P>
<P>BUT is Heaven &s;o &s;mall a Trifle in &s;uch Men's E&s;teem, as not to be worth a little gilded Earth? Is Eternal Life &s;o mean a Purcha&s;e, as not to de&s;erve the temporary Renunciation of a few tran&s;itory Riches? Surely it is? But however incon&s;i&s;tent &s;uch a Beha|viour may be, this inordinate Love of Money is too evidently the common and fatal Cau&s;e why &s;o many are no more than <HI>Almo&s;t Chri&s;tians.</HI></P>
<P>NOR is the reigning Love of Plea&s;ure a le&s;s un|common, or a le&s;s fatal Cau&s;e why &s;o many are no more than <HI>Almo&s;t Chri&s;tians.</HI> Thou&s;ands and Thou|&s;ands there are, who de&s;pi&s;e Riches, and would wil|lingly be True Di&s;ciples of JESUS CHRIST, would parting with their Money make them &s;o; but when they are told that our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord has laid it down as an indi&s;pen&s;able Condition, that <HI>Who&s;oever will come after him mu&s;t deny him&s;elf;</HI>&mdash;like the pitiable Young Man before mentioned, they <HI>go away &s;orrowful:</HI> For they have too great a Love for &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ures: They will, like <HI>Herod,</HI> perhaps &s;end for the Mini&s;ters of CHRIST, as He did for <HI>John,</HI> and hear them glad|ly: But touch them in their <HI>Herodias,</HI> tell them they
<PB N="15" REF="004446_0008_100D9D67544B2508">
mu&s;t part with &s;uch or &s;uch a darling Plea&s;ure; and with Wicked <HI>Ahab</HI> they cry out, <HI>Ha&s;t thou found us, O our Enemy?&mdash;</HI></P>
<P>TELL them of the Nece&s;&s;ity of Mortification, Fa&s;t|ing, and Self-Denial, and it is as difficult to them to hear, as if you was to bid them <HI>cut off a Right Hand or pluck out a Right Eye:</HI> They cannot think our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord requires &s;o much at their Hands, though an in&s;pired Apo&s;tle has commanded us to <HI>mortify our Members which are upon the Earth:</HI> And He him&s;elf, even after he had converted Millions, and was very near arrived to the End of his Race, yet profe&s;&s;ed that it was his daily Practice to <HI>Keep under his Body, and bring it into Subjection, le&s;t after he had preached to Others, He him&s;elf &s;hould be a Ca&s;t-away!</HI></P>
<P>BUT &s;ome Men would be wi&s;er than this Great Apo&s;tle, and chalk out to us what they fal&s;ely imagine an ea&s;ier Way to Happine&s;s. They would flatter us we may go to Heaven without offering Violence to our &s;en&s;ual Appetites; and <HI>enter into the Strait Gate</HI> without <HI>&s;triving</HI> again&s;t our carnal Inclinations. And this is another Rea&s;on why &s;o many are only <HI>Almo&s;t,</HI> and not <HI>Altogether Chri&s;tians.</HI></P>
<P>THE Fifth and la&s;t Rea&s;on I &s;hall a&s;&s;ign why &s;o many are only <HI>Almo&s;t Chri&s;tians,</HI> is a Ficklene&s;s and In&s;tability of Temper.</P>
<P>IT has been, no doubt, the Misfortune that many a Mini&s;ter and &s;incere <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> has met with to weep and wail over Numbers of promi&s;ing Converts, who &s;eemingly began in the Spirit, but after a while have fell away, and ba&s;ely ended in the Fle&s;h; and this not for want of right Notions in Religion, nor out of a &s;ervile Fear of Man, nor out of a Love of Money or
<PB N="16" REF="004446_0009_100D9D6A35D1A620">
&s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ure, but out of an In&s;tability and Fickle|ne&s;s of Temper.</P>
<P>THEY look'd upon Religion merely for Novelty; as &s;omething which plea&s;ed them for a while, but after their Curio&s;ity was &s;atisfied, they have laid it a&s;ide again; Like the Young Man that came to &s;ee JESUS with a Linnen Cloth about his naked Body, they have followed him for a Sea&s;on, but when Temp|tations have come to take hold on them, for want of a little more Re&s;olution, they have been &s;tripped of all their good Intentions, and <HI>fled away naked.</HI> They at fir&s;t, <HI>like a Tree planted by the Water-&s;ide,</HI> grew up and flouri&s;hed for a while; <HI>but having no Root in them|&s;elves,</HI> no inward Principle of Holine&s;s and Piety, like <HI>Jonah's</HI> Gourd, were &s;oon <HI>dried up, cut down, and withered.</HI> Their good Intentions are but too like the violent Motions of the Animal Spirits of a Body newly beheaded, which though impetuous, are not la&s;ting. In &s;hort, they &s;et out well in their Journey to Hea|ven, but finding the Way either narrower or longer than they expected,&mdash;through an Un&s;teadine&s;s of Temper, They have made an Eternal Halt, and &s;o <HI>returned like the Dog to his Vomit, or like the Sow that was wa&s;hed to her wallowing in the Mire!</HI></P>
<P>BUT I tremble to pronounce the Fate of &s;uch un|&s;table Professors, <HI>who having put their Hands to the Plow,</HI> for want of a little more Re&s;olution, &s;hamefully <HI>look back.</HI> How &s;hall I repeat to them that dreadful Threatning, <HI>If any Man draw back, my Soul &s;hall have no Plea&s;ure in him!</HI> And again, <HI>It is impo&s;&s;ible,</HI> that is, exceeding difficult at lea&s;t, <HI>for tho&s;e that have been once enlightned, and have ta&s;ted the Good Gift of GOD's</HI> Holy Spirit, <HI>and the Powers of the World to come, if
<PB N="17" REF="004446_0009_100D9D6A35D1A620">
They &s;hould fall away, to be renewed again unto Repen|tance.</HI> But notwith&s;tanding the Go&s;pel is &s;o &s;evere again&s;t Apo&s;tates, yet many that begun well, through a Ficklene&s;s of Temper, (Oh that none of us here pre|&s;ent may ever be &s;uch) have been by this Means of <HI>the Number of tho&s;e that turn back unto Perdition.</HI> And this is the Fifth and la&s;t Rea&s;on I &s;hall give why &s;o many are only <HI>Almo&s;t</HI> and not <HI>Altogether Chri&s;tians.</HI></P>
<P>BUT you, Brethren, have not <HI>&s;o</HI> learned CHRIST, GOD forbid that a Fear of a little Contempt, a Love of a little worldly Gain, or a Fondne&s;s for a little &s;en|&s;ual Plea&s;ure, or Want of a &s;teady Re&s;olution, &s;hould hinder you from entering into Eternal Life, or make you &s;o &s;otti&s;h as to think you may compound Matters between GOD and your Souls.</P>
<P>III. PROCEED we therefore now to the <HI>Third Ge|neral Thing</HI> propo&s;ed, namely, To con&s;ider the Folly of being no more than an <HI>Almo&s;t Chri&s;tian.</HI></P>
<P>AND the fir&s;t Proof I &s;hall give of the Folly of &s;uch a Proceeding is,&mdash;that it is ineffectual to Salva|tion. It is true, &s;uch Men are Almo&s;t Good, but <HI>almo&s;t</HI> to hit the Mark is <HI>really</HI> to mi&s;s it. GOD re|quires us to <HI>love him with all our Hearts, with all our Souls, and with all our Strength:</HI> He loves us too well to admit any Rival; becau&s;e &s;o far as our Hearts are empty of GOD, &s;o far mu&s;t they be unhappy. The Devil indeed, like the fal&s;e Mother that came before <HI>Solomon,</HI> would have our Hearts divided, as &s;he would have had the Child; but GOD, like the true Mother, will have all or none. <HI>My Son, give me thy Heart,</HI> thy whole Heart, is the general Call to all: And if we
<PB N="18" REF="004446_0010_100D9D6C00BB31E0">
do not perform this Condition, we never can expect the Divine Mercy.</P>
<P>PERSONS may indeed flatter them&s;elves that a par|tial Obedience will &s;erve their Turn&punc; but GOD at the Great Day will &s;trike them dead, as he did <HI>Anna|nias</HI> and <HI>Sapphira</HI> by the Mouth of his Servant <HI>Peter,</HI> for pretending to offer him all their Hearts, when they <HI>kept back</HI> from him the greate&s;t <HI>Part.</HI> They may perhaps impo&s;e upon their fellow Creatures for a while, but He that enabled <HI>Ahijah</HI> to cry out, <HI>Come in, thou Wife of Jeroboam,</HI> when &s;he came di&s;gui&s;ed to enquire about her &s;ick Son, will al&s;o di&s;cover Them through their mo&s;t artful Di&s;&s;imulations, and if <HI>their Hearts are not whole with him,&mdash;appoint them their Portion with Hypocrites and Unbelievers.</HI></P>
<P>BUT Secondly, What renders an half-way Piety more inexcu&s;able is, that it is not only in&s;ufficient to our own Salvation, but al&s;o mo&s;t prejudical to that of Others.</P>
<P>AN <HI>Almo&s;t Chri&s;tian</HI> is one of the mo&s;t hurtful Crea|tures in the World: He is a <HI>Wolf in Sheep's Cloath|ing;</HI> He is one of tho&s;e fal&s;e Prophets our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord bids us beware of, in his Sermon on the Mount, who would per&s;wade Men, that the Way to Heaven is broader than it really is; and thereby, as it was ob&s;erved before, <HI>enter not into the Kingdom of GOD them&s;elves, and tho&s;e that are entering in, they hinder.</HI> The&s;e, the&s;e are the Men that turn the World into a lukewarm <HI>Laodicean</HI> Spirit; that hang out fal&s;e Lights, and &s;o &s;hipwreck unthinking benighted Souls in their Voyage to the Heaven where they would be. The&s;e are they that are greater Enemies to the Cro&s;s
<PB N="19" REF="004446_0010_100D9D6C00BB31E0">
of CHRIST, than Infidels them&s;elves: For of an Un|believer every one will be aware; but an <HI>Almo&s;t Chri&s;tian,</HI> through his &s;ubtle Hyp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y, <HI>draws away many after him;</HI> and therefore mu&s;t expect to <HI>receive the greater Damnation.</HI></P>
<P>BUT Thirdly, As it is mo&s;t prejudicial to our&s;elves and hurtful to others, &s;o it is the greate&s;t Piece of Ingratitude we can expre&s;s towards our Lord and Ma&s;ter JESUS CHRIST. For did He come down from Heaven, and &s;hed his precious Blood, to pur|cha&s;e tho&s;e Hearts of ours, and &s;hall we only give him half of them? Oh how can we &s;ay we love Him, when our Hearts are not wholly with him? How can we call Him our Saviour, when we will not endea|vour &s;incerely to approve our&s;elves to Him, and &s;o let him &s;ee of the Travail of his Soul, and be &s;atisfied!</P>
<P>HAD any of us purcha&s;ed a Slave at a mo&s;t expen|&s;ive Rate, that was before involved in the utmo&s;t Mi&s;eries and Torments, and &s;o mu&s;t have continued for ever,&mdash;had we &s;hut up our Bowels of Com|pa&s;&s;ion from him; and was this Slave afterwards to grow rebellious, or deny giving us but half his Ser|vice: How, how &s;hould we exclaim again&s;t his ba&s;e Ingratitude! And yet this ba&s;e ungrateful Slave thou art, O Man, who acknowledge&s;t thy&s;elf to be re|deemed from infinite unavoidable Mi&s;ery and Puni&s;h|ment, by the Death of JESUS CHRIST, and yet wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> not give thy&s;elf wholly to Him. But &s;hall we deal with GOD our Maker in a Manner we would not be dealt with by a Man like our&s;elves? Shall we mete but a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s Mea&s;ure of Love to our Saviour, than we would have dealt to our&s;elves? GOD forbid!</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="004446_0011_100D9D6ED71EEE18">
IV. No, (that I may come to the la&s;t Thing pro|po&s;ed, namely, to add a Word or two of Exhortation to be not only <HI>Almo&s;t,</HI> but <HI>Altogether Chri&s;tians)</HI> Let us &s;corn all &s;uch ba&s;e and treacherous Treatment of our King and Saviour, nay our GOD. Let us not take &s;ome Pains all our Lives to go to Heaven, and yet plunge our&s;elves into Hell at la&s;t. Let us give GOD our whole Hearts, and no longer <HI>halt between two Opinions: If the World be GOD, let us &s;erve</HI> That; <HI>If</HI> Plea&s;ure <HI>be a GOD, let us &s;erve</HI> That; but <HI>if the LORD He be GOD,</HI> let us, Oh <HI>let us &s;erve Him alone.</HI> Alas! Why, why &s;hould we &s;tand out any longer? Why &s;hould we be &s;o in Love with Slavery, as not wholly to renounce the World, the Fle&s;h, and the Devil, which, like &s;o many &s;piritual Chains, bind down our Souls, and hinder them from flying up to GOD. Alas! What are we afraid of? Is not GOD able to reward our entire Obedience? If He is, as the <HI>Almo&s;t Chri&s;tian's</HI> lame Way of &s;erving Him &s;eems to grant,&mdash;Why then will we not &s;erve Him entirely? For the &s;ame Rea&s;on we do &s;o much, why do we not do more? Or do you think that being only half Religious will make you happy, but that going farther will render you mi&s;e|rable and unea&s;y? Alas! this, my Brethren, is De|lu&s;ion all over! For what is it but this <HI>half Piety,</HI> this wavering between GOD and the World, that makes &s;o many that are &s;eemingly well di&s;po&s;ed, &s;uch utter Strangers to the Comforts of Religion? They chu&s;e ju&s;t &s;o much of Religion as will di&s;turb them in their Lu&s;ts, and follow their Lu&s;ts &s;o far as to deprive them&s;elves of the Comforts of Reli|gion. Whereas, on the contrary, would they &s;incerely
<PB N="21" REF="004446_0011_100D9D6ED71EEE18">
<HI>leave all</HI> in Affection, and <HI>give their Hearts</HI> wholly <HI>to GOD;</HI> They would then (and they cannot 'till then) experience the un&s;peakable Plea&s;ure of having a Mind at Unity with it&s;elf, and enjoy &s;uch a Peace of GOD, which even in this Life pa&s;&s;es all Under|&s;tanding, and which they were entire Strangers to before. It is true, if we will devote our&s;elves en|tirely to GOD, we mu&s;t meet with Contempt; but then it is becau&s;e Contempt is nece&s;&s;ary to heal our Pride. We mu&s;t renounce &s;ome &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ure; but then it is becau&s;e tho&s;e unfit us for Spiritual ones, which are infinitely better. We mu&s;t renounce the Love of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> World; but then it is that we may be filled with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he Love of GOD: And when that has once enlarg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d our Hearts, we &s;hall, like <HI>Jacob</HI> when he &s;erved for his beloved <HI>Rachael,</HI> think nothing too difficult to undergo, no Hard&s;hips too tedious to en|dure, becau&s;e of the Love we &s;hall then have for our dear Redeemer. Thus ea&s;y, thus delightful will be the Ways of GOD even in this Life: But when once we throw off the&s;e Bodies, and our Souls are <HI>filled with all the Fulne&s;s of GOD,</HI> Oh! What Heart can conceive, What Tongue can expre&s;s, with what un&s;peakable Joy and Con&s;olation we &s;hall then look back on our pa&s;t &s;incere and hearty Services, which have procured us &s;o invaluable a Reward! Think you then, my dear Hearers, we &s;hall repent we had done too much; or rather think you not we &s;hall be a&s;hamed that we did no more; and blu&s;h we were &s;o backward to give up All to GOD, when he in|tended hereafter to give us Him&s;elf?&mdash;Let me therefore, to conclude, exhort you, my Brethren, to have always the Un&s;peakable Reward of an entire

Obedience &s;et before you; and think withal, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Degree of Holine&s;s you neglect, every In&s;tance of Piety you pa&s;s by, is a Jewel taken out of your Crown, a Degree of Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s lo&s;t in the Vi&s;ion of GOD. Oh! do but always think and act thus, and you will no longer be labouring to compound Mat|ters between GOD and the World; but on the con|trary, be daily endeavouring to give up your &s;elves more and more unto Him; you will be always Watching, always Praying, always a&s;piring after far|ther Degrees of Purity, and Love, and &s;o con&s;equent|ly always preparing your&s;elves for a fuller Light and Enjoyment of that GOD, in who&s;e Pre&s;ence there is Fulne&s;s of Joy, and at who&s;e Right Hand there are Plea&s;ures for evermore! <HI>Amen!
