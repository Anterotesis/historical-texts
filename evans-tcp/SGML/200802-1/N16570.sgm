<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>A</HI> number of Phy&s;icians in the city and county of New-Haven, &s;timulated by the importance of the object, and the laudable example of the faculty in the various nations of Europe, and in &s;ome parts of America, formed a &s;ociety in the year <HI>1784,</HI> for the purpo&s;e of improving them&s;elves in Medical know|ledge.</P>
<P>The ca&s;es and ob&s;ervations, which have been exhibited to the &s;ociety, are given to the public, in the following &s;heets, who it is hoped will regard with a favourable eye, the fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay of this infant in|&s;titution. All attempts to improve a &s;cience which is &s;ub&s;ervient to the deare&s;t intere&s;ts of humanity, mu&s;t meet the approbation of every benevolent mind. At|tempts of this nature are particularly nece&s;&s;ary, and mu&s;t be peculiarly u&s;eful, in an infant empire, where the &s;eeds of &s;cience, though widely di&s;&s;eminated, are but ju&s;t beginning to germinate. Their future growth and increa&s;e depend on the care and attention with which they are nurtured. To excite others to this laudable and &s;alutary work, is one principal object of this publication. It has not we pre&s;ume proceeded from incapacity, or a criminal inattention to the inte|re&s;ts of humanity that the faculty in this country have hitherto contributed &s;o little to the general &s;tock of Medical knowledge. In a widely extended country, at a di&s;tance from each other, it has not been in their power to unite their efforts in this noble pur&s;uit. The late war brought many ingenious and learned Phy|&s;icians together from all parts of the continent, and the army formed them into a temporary &s;ociety, who&s;e unre&s;erved communications have contributed to the
<PB N="iv" REF="021296_0003_0FB304766DA95C90">
improvement of medical knowledge, and the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of a new and important aera in the healing art. By this mean the faculty have become more &s;en&s;ible of the importance of uniting their endeavours, and &s;everal Medical &s;ocieties have been formed in differ|ent parts of the United States. Should &s;imilar in&s;ti|tutions become general, and permanent, there is rea|&s;on to hope that Medical literature will &s;oon be in as flouri&s;hing a &s;tate in this country as in any part of Europe. A &s;pirit of emulation will take place, &s;loth and ignorance decline, and the art appear with dignity and lu&s;tre. Should this effort of the &s;o|ciety contribute in the &s;malle&s;t degree to effect tho&s;e de&s;irable ends, it will afford them ample &s;atisfaction for their labour.</P>
<P>This &s;ociety was formed on the mo&s;t liberal and gen|erous principles, and was de&s;igned fir&s;t to lay a foun|dation for that unanimity and friend&s;hip which is e&s;|&s;ential to the dignity and u&s;efulne&s;s of the profe&s;&s;ion; to accompli&s;h which, they re&s;olved &s;econdly, to meet once in three months: thirdly, that in all ca&s;es where coun&s;el is requi&s;ite they will a&s;&s;i&s;t each other without re&s;erve: fourthly, That all reputable practitioners in the county, who have been in the practice for one year or more, may be admitted members: fifthly, that they will communicate their ob&s;ervations on the air, &s;ea&s;ons and climate, with &s;uch di&s;coveries as they may make in phy&s;ic, &s;urgery, botany or chemi&s;try, &amp; deliver faithful hi&s;tories of the various di&s;ea&s;es incident to the inhabitants of this country, with the mode of treatment and event in &s;ingular ca&s;es: &s;ixthly, to open a corre&s;pondence with the Medical Societies in the neighbouring &s;tates and in Europe, for which pur|po&s;e they have a &s;tanding committee of corre&s;pond|ence: &s;eventhly, to appoint a committee for the pur|po&s;e
<PB N="v" REF="021296_0004_0FB30477E78BBFB0">
of examining candidates for the profe&s;&s;ion, and to give certificates to the de&s;erving.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of the&s;e re&s;olutions, the Society have punctually attended their meetings, examined and ap|proved a number of candidates, many of whom bid fair to be ornaments to the profe&s;&s;ion: and of late they have made &s;ome advances towards the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of a fund, which promi&s;es permanency to the in&s;titution.</P>
<P>Any communications which may tend to the ad|vancement of the &s;cience, from gentlemen of the fa|culty in other parts of this and in the neighbour|ing &s;tates or el&s;ewhere, will be thankfully re|ceived, and &s;uch as may be deemed worthy of publication pre&s;erved for a future volume.&mdash; Such communications may be &s;ent to the Secretary<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. SAMUEL DARLING.</NOTE>, or any other member of the Society, by whom they will be exhibited to the Society, and lodged on their files for future u&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>A Singultus (from an adhe&s;ion of the Liver to the Diaphragm) proving fatal. By Dr. Samuel Ne&s;bitt. Read to the Society, <DATE><HI>3</HI>d May, <HI>1784.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<P>ON the 4th of October, 1783, I was called in council with Dr. Eneas Mun&s;on, to vi&s;it Polydore, a Negro &s;ervent of Capt. Trowbridge of this city, aged 26; his &s;ymptoms were, a fixed pain under the Cartilago En&s;iformis, a &s;en&s;e of ful|ne&s;s at the pit of the &s;tomach, with dy&s;pnaea, and very frequent hiccup that was violent, and affect|ed greatly his pul&s;e, &s;o as to produce the true faultering, or interrupted pul&s;e, he had no cardial|gia, nor di&s;po&s;ition to vomit, only an eructation, ari&s;ing from the &s;pa&s;ms of the diaphragm; he had been attacked twice with the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e, in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t twelve months, previous to the pre&s;ent. In the former attacks, Ab&s;orbents, Correctors, and Anti&s;pa&s;modics, had been tried to little purpo&s;e, the di&s;ea&s;e &s;pent it&s;elf gradually, and the Singultus wore off, in proportion as the patient grew weak. Perhaps the ten&s;ion and in|flammation, gave way to relaxation and re&s;olution; but I make no doubt, left an adhe&s;ion of the Li|ver to the diaphragm, from the fir&s;t attack; which might gain ground as the di&s;ea&s;e recurred, and I think it may be warranted from this circum|&s;tance of the patient's being unea&s;y in the inter|vals of the recited affections, with that &s;en&s;e of
<PB N="10" REF="021296_0009_0FB3047FDE4DF328">
fulne&s;s, at his &s;tomach, and di&s;turbed re&s;pirati|on.</P>
<P>From the hi&s;tory of the di&s;ea&s;e, previous to the 4th of October, and the Symptoms now &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ing, Dr. Mun&s;on and my&s;elf were of opinion, that an inflammatory affection of the diaphragm and liver was deducible, and that the &s;tomach and other vi&s;cera were not affected. We adopted the antiphlogi&s;tic treatment, blood drawn and repeated, was &s;izey and cohe&s;ive, the &s;erum &s;trongly impregnated with bile, correctors and anti&s;pa&s;modies were given to temporize, epi&s;pa&s;t|ics over the part affected were applied, and after a cour&s;e of three weeks attendance (the &s;ymp|toms gradually abating) the di&s;ea&s;e gave way, &s;o as to leave the patient apparently well, except that &s;en&s;e of fulne&s;s at his &s;tomach.</P>
<P>On the 27th of March la&s;t, the patient called on me, complained of a head-ache, and of being much pre&s;&s;ed at his &s;tomach, his pul&s;e moderate, and no return of hiccups. I pre&s;cribed a cathar|tic, and heard no more of him, until the 29th of that month. When I vi&s;ited him, he complained of head-ache, an unea&s;y breathing, with a &s;mall frequent cough, the old &s;en&s;e of fulne&s;s, but no pain or hiccups. I let blood which was florid, but not &s;izey nor uncommonly cohe&s;ive. I pre|&s;cribed an emetic which operated gently, but exci|ted no &s;pa&s;ms nor additional unea&s;ine&s;s. The 30th the head ache was encrea&s;ed and &s;ome degree of fever. I pre&s;cribed a bolus of five gr. merc. dulc. to be worked off with &s;alts and manna.</P>
<P>On the 31&s;t he &s;eemed relieved, head-ache and &s;ymptoms abated. April 1&s;t. found him no wor&s;e, only pre&s;cribed the dulcif. &s;p. of Nitre, and diluents. The 2d of April, he complained more
<PB N="11" REF="021296_0010_0FB30480E6A714A0">
of his head, and that the room was dark, his fe|ver gone, and pul&s;e rather &s;mall and interrupted; but as the day was &s;tormy, and the room he was then in was a dark room, I did not apprehend a failure of vi&s;ion. The 3d his complaints the &s;ame, and evident that vi&s;ion was affected, attended with a degree of &s;tupor. I applyed a large epi|&s;pa&s;tic to the nape of his neck. And on the 4th repeated the purge with the calomel, which not operating kindly an enema was given. On the 5th I found him totally blind, and &s;o in&s;en&s;ible as to afford no &s;ati&s;factory an&s;wer to any of my que&s;|tions, his pul&s;e feeble and oppre&s;&s;ed, accompa|nied with a &s;ub&s;ultus tendinum. I gave him four portions of the factit. cinnabar, a &s;cruple in each do&s;e, once in &s;ix hours. On the 6th I found his &s;ight a little re&s;tored, and more &s;en&s;ible, tho' &s;till incoherent in his an&s;wers and ob&s;ervations. I was favoured with Dr. Eneas Mun&s;on in council this evening; we agreed to pre&s;cribe an infu&s;ion of the valerian, and to repeat the next morning, the mercurial purge; it did not operate. On the 7th we met in council, ordered the repetition of ene|mas, the purge not having operated; On this day the hiccups came on gradually at fir&s;t, and with a con&s;tant eructation of a frothy mucus from the lungs and &s;tomach. An anodyne was given this evening. On the 8th I found him much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with an increa&s;e of the hiccups, and a continuation of all the other &s;ymptoms; In the evening I pre&s;cribed two anodynes, one to be given h. &s;. alter in four hours if the hiccups were violent. On the 9th his &s;ymptoms much the &s;ame, with the addition of a &s;trangury and re|tention of urine, through the whole of the night and day; I pre&s;cribed an emollient fotus to the pubis, and a decoction of the cooling &s;eeds and
<PB N="12" REF="021296_0011_0FB30482C035E4E0">
roots, propo&s;ing to u&s;e the catheter in the morn|ing if he was not relieved. On the 10th found he had pa&s;&s;ed urine freely in the night, the &s;tran|gury in &s;ome mea&s;ure abated, the hiccups violent and almo&s;t ince&s;&s;ant. I pre&s;cribed anti&s;pa&s;modic bolu&s;&s;es of camphor, opium, and gum a&s;&s;a&s;aetida, to be wa&s;hed down with infus. valerian; the hic|cups were ince&s;&s;ant, and the eructation &s;o violent that he &s;pouted up every part of drink or medi|cine, as &s;oon as he attempted to &s;wallow, altho' he manife&s;ted no aver&s;ion to anything offered him. On the 11th, he was evidently growing wor&s;e, altho' the hiccups were not &s;o violent, yet were they as ince&s;&s;ant, with delirium, &s;ub&s;ultus tendi|num, and a trembling pul&s;e. On the 12th ha|ving pa&s;&s;ed a very re&s;tle&s;s night, the eructations and hiccups continuing, but le&s;s delirium; he complained of a burning heat in his belly, from which a mortification of the vi&s;cera was apprehend|ed. On the 13th in the morning he died, nor did the hiccups entirely leave him, until he breathed his la&s;t. On opening the body, in pre&s;ence of Drs. Hubbard, Mun&s;on, Darling &amp;c. it appear|ed as follows; the omentum adhered &s;trongly to the pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itoneum and inte&s;tines, &s;o as not to be &s;e|parated without great difficulty, the fat of the omentum was entirely wa&s;ted, &s;o as to be a mere parchment, except &s;mall ve&s;icles of fat, inter|&s;per&s;ed over it, and gangrenous. The inte&s;tines only appeared to view, occupying the place of the &s;tomach and liver, and &s;trongly drawn up to the diaphragm; the inte&s;tines were inter&s;per&s;ed with mortified &s;pots, and adhered to each other by their external coats. The ve&s;ica urinaria was high in the pelvis, and di&s;tended with urine. The &s;tomach appeared &s;ound, but drawn out of its place by the &s;pa&s;ms, lying under the arch of the
<PB N="13" REF="021296_0012_0FB30483EB559CD8">
diaphragm, and pre&s;&s;ed down under the advan|ced inte&s;tines. The liver adhered &s;trongly to the diaphragm, &s;o as not to be &s;eparated without tear|ing, and pre&s;&s;ed out of view under the arch of the retracted diaphragm. The anterior and convex part of the liver adhered to the diaphragm, &s;o as to be almo&s;t inverted, and al&s;o adhered &s;trongly to the peritoneum below. The ve|&s;ica fellis was &s;mall, &s;hrunk, with a &s;mall quanti|ty of bile, and adhered &s;trongly to that part of the duodenum to which it lay contiguous, and not to be &s;eparated without laceration. On open|ing the thorax, the heart and its pericardium, was found lying (or rather pre&s;&s;ed by the contrac|tion of the diaphragm) acro&s;s the thorax, with its apex to the left, and its top or auricles to the right; there was no fluid contained in the pericar|dium, the heart was about double the u&s;ual &s;ize, and the vena cava and aorta greatly di&s;tended. The left lobe of the lungs was not to be &s;een un|till the heart was drawn a&s;ide, being pre&s;&s;ed down to the left &s;ide of the vertebrae, adhering &s;trongly to the pleura; neither lobe appeared otherwi&s;e di&s;ea&s;ed. May I not, gentlemen, from the hi&s;tory of the ca&s;e, and the appearances after death, be authorized to &s;ay, that a primary inflammation of the liver and diaphragm, was the proximate cau&s;e of the whole train of &s;ymptoms, and preternatural ap|pearance of the abdominal &amp; thoracic vi&s;cera, that the Singultus originated from the heat of an in|flamed liver, and its adhe&s;ion to the diaphragm, that the dy&s;pnaea and cough, were occa&s;ioned by the great &s;pa&s;modic contraction of the diaphragm, di&s;turbing re&s;piration; the heart's po&s;ition and &s;ize, al&s;o, would naturally produce dy&s;pnaea, a tick|ling cough, &amp;c. May we not very readily deduce the head ache, and lo&s;s of vi&s;ion, delirium &amp;c.
<PB N="14" REF="021296_0013_0FB3048698755270">
from the po&s;ition and pre&s;&s;ure of the heart, as thereby the entrance of the blood by the vena cava, was greatly ob&s;tructed, and its exit thro' the pulmonic arteries and aorta, by the praeter|natural curve of tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els greatly interrutped, from whence might ari&s;e and &s;ub&s;i&s;t, tho&s;e affec|tions of the brain &s;o manife&s;t in the la&s;t acce&s;&s;ion of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The great and preternatural enlargement of the vena cava and aorta, prove the increa&s;ed re&s;i&s;t|ance the blood met with, both on its return to and from the heart. How nece&s;&s;ary then gentle|men is it, rightly to di&s;tingui&s;h or develope, the true &s;ource of a &s;ingultus, as it may ari&s;e from various cau&s;es; I mean not that &s;ingultus, which is an attendant on death, and is irremediable from the nature of the ca&s;e. An acrimony in the &s;tom|ach, irritating the nervous parts, will produce a hiccup, originating from the &s;ame cau&s;e as the cardialgia, and removable on the &s;ame principle, by ab&s;orbents, &amp;c. But a &s;ingultus attended with pain at the pit of the &s;tomach, or accompanied with pleuritic &s;ymptoms, denote an inflammation of the diaphragm, and may be &s;trictly accounted a pathognomic &s;ymptom of it. Here it is appa|rent, that ab&s;orbents and correctors will remove the one, while the lancet and antiphlogi&s;tic regi|men only is capable of effecting the other.</P>

<HEAD>Ca&s;e of a Puerperal Fever, &s;ucce&s;sfully treated with the Bark. By Dr. Elnathan Beach. Read <DATE>October <HI>13, 1785.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<P>A Woman aged twenty-one, of a &s;anguine habit, on the 19th of March, 1784, be|came mother of a living child; her labour was ea|&s;y,
<PB N="15" REF="021296_0014_0FB3048A763EFE50">
natural, and every circum&s;tance favourable. On the evening of the 23d, I was called&mdash;found little or no fever attending; but great pain in the abdomen, accompanied with a violent diarrhaea, which had been of &s;ome days continuance; the lochial di&s;charge irregular, the &s;kin dry. I gave an opiate, to abate the &s;everity of the pain, and to correct the diarrhaea accompanied it with Rhubarb. This had the de&s;ired effect, and &s;he re&s;|ted well the &s;ucceeding night. The next morning I found her in a free, gentle per&s;piration, and without pain, except what was occa&s;ioned by the operation of the purge. Upon the&s;e &s;ymptoms of amendment, I left her, and did not &s;ee her until the 26th; when I found &s;he had been attack|ed with rigors, which were &s;ucceeded by heat, thir&s;t, and fever, together with excruciat|ing pains in the abdomen,&mdash;extending to the uterus, with a reddi&s;h &s;treak on the &s;urface, &s;preading it&s;elf to the umbilical region, with other &s;ymptoms of an inflammation of that vi&s;cus. I pre&s;cribed the common antiphlogi&s;tic remedies, as evacuants, cooling febrifuges and aperients, together with epithems, catapla&s;ms, and injections; which cour&s;e was per&s;i&s;ted in until the 30th, when I found the &s;treak be|fore mentioned was extended over the whole ab|domen, and changed from a redi&s;h to a cineritious hue, the pul&s;e &s;mall, the countenance pale and wan;&mdash;the part affected almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible to the touch. I directed to the u&s;e of the bark in decoction, acidulated with elixir vitriol. The next morning, the 31&s;t, found the di&s;order greatly increa&s;ed, every &s;ymptom pregnant with danger&mdash; the abdomen almo&s;t covered with livid ve&s;icles, the inter&s;tices of a negro black, with a total in|&s;en&s;ibility

of the part, copious di&s;charges, &s;ani|ous and fetid, from the uterus. The countenance dejected and gha&s;tly, the voice indi&s;tinct, pul&s;e weak and intermitting. The ca&s;e being thus al|arming, Dr. Andrews was con&s;ulted, we agreed to make a thorough trial of the bark, and direct|ed it to be taken in &s;ub&s;tance and decoction, ac|companied with &s;ome alexipharmics. She took 1&frac12; ounces a day, be&s;ides the application of a &s;trong tincture externally, together with injecti|ons; and in a few days a de&s;quamation of the cuticle took place, the lividity di&s;appeared; her &s;trength gradually returned, and by the beginning of May, &s;he acquired her former health.</P>

<HEAD>CASE II.</HEAD>
<P>JONATHAN NORTHRUP, of Milford, aged about 26 years, eating &s;ome beef and cab|bage, &s;wallowed a &s;cale of beef bone in the cab|bage, of a triangular figure, of more than one inch in length, from the ba&s;e to the point: the point of which as well as the &s;ides, were thin and &s;harp. This bone lodged in the gula, between the upper end of the &s;ternum and pomum Adami. The &s;ituation might be di&s;cerned by feeling with the fingers, on each &s;ide of the trachea. This ca&s;e was attended with tumour and extreme pain.</P>
<P>In this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;tate, Mr. Northrup made ap|plication to &s;undry gentlemen of the faculty, who tried various methods to relieve him, among the re&s;t a pair of long, &s;lender, curved, crane bills, were introduced, with a view to extract the bone; but all to no purpo&s;e. Twenty-four hours after this accident Mr. Northrup applied to me. I made u&s;e of the method pre&s;cribed in the ca&s;e of Mr. Smith; but it had no effect.</P>
<P>I then made a &s;olution of four grains of tartar emetic, in warm water, which he drank, and in about fifteen minutes he brought up the bone by vomit, and was effectually relieved.</P>
<P>As it is one of the known laws of hydraulics, that fluids when pre&s;&s;ed, pre&s;s undequaque, the application appeared plain to me in the recited ca&s;es; for I con&s;idered the gula to be a flexible, cylindrical tube, which by means of its mu&s;cular fibres, may be contracted or dilated. I al&s;o con&s;idered the great force of the mu&s;cles employed in the action of vomiting; whereby the fluid contents of the &s;tomach are forced through
<PB N="18" REF="021296_0017_0FB3049C77CB5B10">
the upper orifice, into the ae&s;ophagus, in a full &s;tream; there meeting with re&s;i&s;tance from the offending body, will expand the gula, and being urged on by the impetus of the fluid, will over|come the re&s;i&s;tance and bear away the offending matter in the torrent of water by the mouth.&mdash; This, in fact, was the i&s;&s;ue of the two ca&s;es above.</P>
<P>I am per&s;uaded that the &s;ame method may be u&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s, in almo&s;t every ca&s;e where the patient can be prevailed with, to drink a &s;uffi|cient quantity of water, or other liquid.</P>
<P>I could add more &s;imilar ca&s;es in confirmation of the practice, but perhaps the foregoing will be &s;ufficient.</P>

<P>ON Saturday the 21&s;t of Augu&s;t, 1784, I was called to vi&s;it a &s;on of Mr. Era&s;tus Brad|ley, of this Town; aged &s;even years; who fell from a tree upon a &s;tone wall, and fractured the right os parietalia. I arrived about half an hour after the accident, found a large wound through the external integuments and a con&s;iderable hem|orhage from the wound; upon introducing my finger found the fractured bone depre&s;&s;ed and compre&s;&s;ing the dura mater; the child being de|lirious and much convul&s;ed. Finding no pro&s;|pect of relief but from the trepan, I proceeded im|mediately to the operation: having denuded the cranium &s;ufficiently to admit the trephine, a he|morrhage en&s;ued, rendering a delay nece&s;&s;ary until
<PB N="19" REF="021296_0018_0FB3049D60F93D08">
the arteries were &s;ecured by ligature; then began a per&s;oration on the &s;ound part of the os bregmatis, near the os frontis, a little to the right of the &s;ut|ura coronalis, then introduced the elevator, with which I rai&s;ed &s;ome &s;mall pieces of the depre&s;&s;ed bones, and took them out: but could not rai&s;e the large&s;t, &s;o as to di&s;engage it from the under part of the &s;ound &s;kull; finding it nece&s;&s;ary to make a &s;econd perforation, I applied the trephine on the os bregmatis, back of the former, and introduced the elevator, with which I di&s;engaged the fract|ured piece, and took it out with my forceps, lay|ing the dura matter bare the extent of the fracture. Then proceeded to dre&s;s the wound, after which I percieved the child had fainted, by rea&s;on of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">diou&s;ne&s;s of the operation and through the lo&s;s of blood; I ordered a little &s;pirits of lavender to be put into his mouth, fre&s;h air to be admitted, and his extremeties rubbed, we &s;oon perceived life in him, and he began to breath and &s;tir his limbs.</P>
<P>In the evening I found his pul&s;e a little quick|ened, ordered him an enema, he appeared to be very re&s;tle&s;s but a little more &s;en&s;ible. In the morning he came to his rea&s;on &s;o as to &s;peak and take &s;uch nouri&s;hment as was pre&s;cribed.</P>
<P>In the evening of the 22d found his fever had encrea&s;ed, pre&s;cribed a gentle cathartic, and in ca&s;e it did not operate by morning, to a&s;&s;i&s;t it by an enema. He being drow&s;y all day, could hardly be per&s;uaded to take any thing.</P>
<P>The 23d found his drow&s;ine&s;s and fever had increa&s;ed; gave him &s;ome febrifuges &amp; ordered his dre&s;&s;ings to be kept wet with &s;pirits, in order to facilitate the removal of the dre&s;&s;ings next day.</P>
<P>Vi&s;ited him the 24th in company with Dr. Mun&s;on&mdash;found his fever and &s;tupor abated;

<P>Vi&s;ited him the 25th in company with Dr. Beard&s;ley; dre&s;&s;ed his wound, there being very little di&s;charge, we pre&s;cribed a gentle cathart|ic; and after its operation the Bark in decoction.</P>
<P>On the 26th with Dr. Mun&s;on; the wound had come to &s;uppuration, as the denuded part of the bones, now changed to a dark hue. We ordered a more copious u&s;e of the bark, and the wound to be continually wet with &s;pirits; he was now perfectly &s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>On the 27th dre&s;&s;ed the wound, found a lauda|ble di&s;charge, and his fever moderate; ordered a cathartic, and the bark to be &s;u&s;pended during its operation.</P>
<P>On the 28th with Dr. Mun&s;on, dre&s;&s;ed his wound, the dura mater began to &s;lough, with a proper di&s;charge from the wound; &s;ome &s;mall pieces of bone being loo&s;e.</P>
<P>On the 29th, found he had pa&s;t a very good night; &s;at up to have his head dre&s;&s;ed; the wound di&s;charged plentifully, and every &s;ymptom was in his favour.</P>
<P>On the 30th removed two &s;mall pieces of bone, the wound di&s;charged freely.</P>
<P>On the 31st dre&s;&s;ed his wound; no apparent alteration, only a little more active and chearful.</P>

<HEAD>Ca&s;e of a Gangrene of the Scrotum, Read <DATE>January, <HI>1785.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<P>MR. S&mdash; H&mdash;, aged forty years, a temperate man, and of a good con|&s;titution, by pro&s;e&s;&s;ion a &s;hoe-maker and tan|ner, was &s;eized with an inten&s;e pain in the glands of the left groin, on September the 19th, 1784, for which a plai&s;ter was applied, formed of the oily dirt which &s;wine leave on fences after rub|bing.</P>
<P>September 20th. I was &s;ent for, and the me&s;|&s;enger told me that the pain was intolerable; but I was engaged another way, and concluding that the di&s;order would &s;ub&s;ide with an anodyne, I &s;ent him one.</P>
<P>September 21&s;t. I vi&s;ited the patient, and found him in a high fever; the &s;crotum and penis greatly tumified, and of a livid colour; I imme|diately opened a vein,, and took away &s;eventeen ounces of blood, which was as buffy as is u&s;ual in a violent pleurify, with very little &s;erum; I ordered a fomentation of bitter herbs boiled in water, to which was added rum. After u&s;ing the fomentation, I applied a catapla&s;m of white-bread, milk, and white ro&s;e leaves, and I order|ed him to take a few do&s;es of camphorated nitre.</P>
<P>September 22d. I found him &s;till under an high fever, and took twelve ounces more of blood, which was le&s;s buffy than before; the parts affected now appeared to be in a &s;tate of mortification, black, and in&s;en&s;ible to the touch; I &s;carified the penis and the &s;crotum in &s;everal places, without giving pain to the patient, and then applied &s;trong &s;pirits and the catapla&s;ms as before; gave him a table-&s;poonful of the cortex
<PB N="22" REF="021296_0021_0FB304A1EA64F378">
peruv. and ordered him to take a like do&s;e every two hours, to be wa&s;hed down with a &s;trong de|coction of the &s;ame, with the addition of red ro&s;e leaves.</P>
<P>September 23d. The tumour and inflamma|tion were much abated; he complained of a pain in two of the fingers of his right hand, on which I ob&s;erved tumours much inflamed, of a ripe cherry colour.</P>
<P>September 24th. The carpus of the &s;ame hand tumified and inflamed, and of a livid hue: I continued the &s;ame pre&s;criptions, with the ad|dition of an emollient cly&s;ter.</P>
<P>September 25th. I found his pul&s;e low, with great faintne&s;s and dejection of mind, apprehend|ing that death would &s;oon clo&s;e the &s;cene. I or|dered him &s;ome wine, which rai&s;ed his &s;pirits and abated his gloomy apprehen&s;ions; and continued the dre&s;&s;ings as u&s;ual. I opened a tumour on his wri&s;t, which di&s;charged purulent matter.</P>
<P>September 26th. I reque&s;ted the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of my friend Dr. Ne&s;bitt. We found the patient under a high fever, and bled him the third time, though we con&s;idered the ca&s;e almo&s;t de&s;perate; we continued the bark, with the elixir vitriol, which was given with the utmo&s;t freedom, with|out any regard to the fever, as we judged it e&s;|&s;ential to the patient's recovery. In three days came on a dige&s;tion and &s;eparation of the mortified parts, which by degrees were removed by the knife; we dre&s;&s;ed the ulcer with dry lint, &s;ome|times making u&s;e of the &s;pirits and the common dige&s;tive, till the whole of the &s;crotum was tak|en off, leaving the te&s;ticles uncovered with the pro&s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ae glans; after the &s;crotum was &s;loughed off, the &s;tate of the juices was &s;o acrid as to de&s;troy

two other coats, the crema&s;ter and the tunica vaginalis, which dige&s;ted, and al&s;o &s;loughed off, leaving the tunica albuginea in a &s;ound &s;tate: he had violent pain in the te&s;ticles, and there was rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect &s;uppuration; when pre&s;&s;ed with the finger the parts were very ela&s;tic, which induced us to think that there was matter contained within: accordingly, we made a &s;mall puncture through the tunica albuginea, but the di&s;charge was only a bloody &s;crum; we continued the &s;ame treat|ment; the te&s;ticles &s;uffered the &s;ame very pain|ful &s;en&s;ation for &s;everal days, and we concluded that matter was formed in them, and opened one of them to its centre to a&s;certain it, but found only a di&s;charge of bloody &s;erum; the wounded te&s;ticle was dre&s;&s;ed with a dige&s;tive, and healed in a few days, at which time the &s;urface of the te&s;ti|ticles next the perinaeum began to granulate and heal very fa&s;t, and cau&s;ed an adhe&s;ion, or union of the te&s;ticles, from each extremity, which now re&s;embled a twin peach or apple; the &s;permatic chords &s;uffered a great contraction, and the te&s;|cles adhered clo&s;ely to the perinaeum, and cica|trized favourably.</P>
<P>The preputium was entirely taken off the pe|nis, the mu&s;cles were di&s;ea&s;ed, and partly de&s;|troyed, the urethra was left without a covering, but the bulb or glans was not affected; a co|vering however, gradually formed over the body of the penis, but le&s;s &s;mooth than before. Soon after the di&s;charge from the mortified parts abated, he complained of a pain in the left &s;ide of the abdomen, which extended up as far as the &s;hort ribs, it was here tumified and inflamed; where|upon we ordered that part to be fomented four or five times a day with warm &s;pirits, and the inflam|mation

and &s;welling &s;oon di&s;appeared: two or three days afterwards a pain came on in the right &s;ide, extending as it had done on the left; we applied the &s;pirits as before, but without ef|fect; we then ordered the application of a ca|tapla&s;m, which &s;oon brought on a &s;uppuration; we perforated the ulcer, and it di&s;charged a large quantity of pus, which continued more or le&s;s for ten days; the patient remaining feeble and greatly emaciated with fever; we ordered a decoc|tion of barley with figs, &s;ago, &s;alop, and panada, (gruel had been his u&s;ual diet, with a little wine) and he continued recovering for the &s;pace of ten days, when he was &s;uddenly &s;eized with a pain in his bowels, &s;ucceeded by a fetid diarhoea: in twenty-four hours he was greatly reduced, fre|quently di&s;charging two or three ounces of puru|lent matter, attended, with a bloody mucus; we gave him lenient purges, &s;uch as &s;enna, manna, and a &s;olution of gum arabic, in barley-water; cly&s;ters prepared with a decoction of the bark and red ro&s;e leaves were frequently admini&s;tered; the&s;e in a few days gave relief, and the matter of the internal ulcer being di&s;charged through the return, the patient recruited every day, and on Decem|ber the 5th, 1784, was able to attend his former bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>In forty-nine days he took fifty-eight ounces of that &s;overeign medicine, the bark, which &s;eemed to contribute in a great mea&s;ure to his perfect recovery.</P>

<P>JANE HARRISON, a &s;ervant maid, aged fourteen years, of a &s;trong and good bodily habit, on the 17th of February la&s;t, voluntarily threw her&s;elf out of a garret window, feet foremo&s;t, which gave her &s;uch a violent &s;hock as to deprive her of her &s;en&s;es. She was immediately taken up, and many attempts made to bleed her, but it was with great difficulty that about twelve ounces of blood was obtained. She remained in a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility during the day and the night fol|lowing; but on Friday morning a little recovered, &s;o as to &s;peak and talk with an air of chearfulne&s;s until evening; when there appeared a rigidity of her limbs, together with a deprivation of &s;en&s;e for &s;ome time, and then a return of &s;en&s;ation, with &s;ome appearance of rea&s;on. On the evening of the 18th, I vi&s;ited her for the fir&s;t time, and pre&s;cribed for her a nervine anti&s;pa&s;modic decoc|tion for the night. On Saturday morning found her no better, but &s;en&s;ele&s;s, with her jaws locked, which I was told had been the ca&s;e during the night; so that &s;he was unable to receive any food or medicine; and by rea&s;on of the projection of the upper jaw, the upper teeth, which were very even and clo&s;ely &s;et, &s;hut over the under teeth, quite down to the gums of the lower jaw, &s;o that nothing could be introduced into her mouth but what was drained through a double row of thick &s;et teeth. The mu&s;cles in her neck, e&s;|pecially the po&s;terior, were very &s;traight, with a rigidity of the whole &s;pine; the countenance was
<PB N="26" REF="021296_0025_0FB304A7E7C20E08">
very florid, the pul&s;e quick, but rather &s;mall&punc; &s;he was ordered the liniment. &s;aponac. with opium and ol. &s;uccin. to embrocate the &s;pine and part<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> contracted; a camphorated anti&s;pa&s;modic fomen|tation was ordered to be applied to the &s;tomach, and enemas with fetid gums injected, and after the foregoing pre&s;criptions, at night &s;he was put into the warm bath, which produced a relaxation of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> her &s;pa&s;ms. On Sunday morning &s;he appeared rational and chearful, and &s;at up, but not without great complaint of pain acro&s;s her reins, extend|ing under the &s;ternum, with univer&s;al &s;orene&s;s. She continued the foregoing pre&s;criptions, with the addition of valerian and faetida by the mouth. As &s;he was now able to &s;wallow, &s;he remained calm during the day and better part of the night, but towards morning was &s;eized with the contrac|tion of the jaw again, together with violent &s;truggles and convul&s;ions: in this &s;ituation &s;he continued during the day: at night with what laudanum was forced into the &s;tomach, and in|jected with an enema, &s;he &s;lept &s;ome time; but on Tue&s;day morning no relaxation of &s;pa&s;m, but &s;tupid and &s;en&s;ele&s;s, with a great degree of opi&s;thotonos, and as I had, in &s;everal in&s;tances heretofore, proved un&s;ucce&s;sful in the u&s;e of the grand &s;pecific, viz. opium, I had determined, in my own mind, if ever I &s;hould have a ca&s;e of the kind under my direction, to depend upon opium no longer than I found it &s;oporific; and if a quantity &s;ufficient to bring on and produce a manife&s;t &s;oporo&s;is did not remove the &s;pa&s;m, I would &s;eek a remedy from &s;ome other means. I therefore now endeavoured, at more lucid intervals, to get down &s;ome &s;mall do&s;es of calomel, and tried the warm bath again, which, &s;o far from
<PB N="27" REF="021296_0026_0FB304A96A18D330">
yielding the relief as before we experienced, that it produced immediate convul&s;ions, &s;o violent as to render the continuation impracticable, &s;he was accordingly put to bed, and was, during Tue&s;day night, attended with all the &s;ymptoms of opi&s;tho|tonos, lock'd jaw, and empro&s;thotonos alternately; but as the &s;pa&s;ms of opi&s;thotonos &amp; empro&s;thotonos counteract each other, they were productive of a tetanus, with a con&s;iderable elevation of the &s;ter|num, attended with great pain and anxiety, with a total inability of &s;wallowing. She remained in this &s;ituation, with convul&s;ions, during Wedne&s;|day night, when an epi&s;pa&s;tic was applied to the nape of her neck, and the calomel continued in &s;mall do&s;es though the quantity got into the &s;to|mach was altogether uncertain; &s;he continued much in the &s;ame &s;tate on Thur&s;day. She growing weaker and more di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and her ca&s;e more de&s;perate, until Friday noon, I determined to try what effects electricity would produce. Accord|ingly a moderate &s;ized receiver was filled, which was di&s;charged on her leg, and pa&s;&s;ed through the body to the head. This immediately produced a tremulous motion in her lips, before &s;tiff and con|tracted, and a grating of the teeth, a &s;ymptom never before ob&s;erved in the cour&s;e of her com|plaints, on which I thought her going into a con|vul&s;ion fit; but to my &s;urprize her jaws were ope|ned, and her tongue extended far out of her mouth, and &s;he rubbing it with her fingers. I a&s;ked her if &s;he could &s;peak&mdash;&s;he gave me to under&s;tand &s;he could not. I then di&s;charg'd a &s;econd receiver in the &s;ame direction with the fir&s;t, and her tongue was immediately at liberty, &s;o that &s;he was able to &s;peak plainly: But ob&s;erving her thumbs contrac|ted, as they had been for twenty four hours, into
<PB N="28" REF="021296_0027_0FB304AAEC7AB800">
the palms of her hands, there was a third &s;hock pa&s;&s;ed through her arms, which loo&s;ed them in&s;t|antly. On Friday night &s;he re&s;ted quietly, and got up on Saturday morning; but on her return to bed &s;he was &s;eized with fits, very &s;imilar to hy|&s;teric fits, but the locking of the jaws did not re|turn; the common nervine, antihy&s;teric medicines were u&s;ed, but to little purpo&s;e, till Monday, when recour&s;e was again had to electricity, which was found effectual for the&s;e fits, and was apply'd repeatedly on their return, until Wedne&s;day fort|night from the time of her fall, when the fits left her, and &s;he is now in a comfortable &s;tate of health.</P>
<P>Thus I have given an exact and plain narrative of facts only, in the ca&s;e; and though, as doctor Sylve&s;ter ob&s;erves, one in&s;tance is &s;carce of con&s;e|quence enough to de&s;erve attention, yet as it is a di&s;order &s;o rare to this climate, but &s;o often fatal when it happens, it will not, I tru&s;t, be thought u&s;ele&s;s to communicate a method, though but once &s;ucce&s;sful. How far the early u&s;e of mercu|ry may be depended on in this di&s;ea&s;e, I am not able, from my own experience, to &s;ay, though it has been recommended as a &s;pecific in the di&s;ord|er. Yet in the ca&s;e above recited, there appeared no amendment until the u&s;e of electricity, which mo&s;t in&s;tantaneou&s;ly relaxed the &s;pa&s;ms, to the a&s;t|oni&s;hment of every by&s;tander. Indeed there was no room to doubt of its being the immediate and &s;ole cau&s;e of relief to the poor girl. Should this communication be an inducement to farther expe|riments of the kind in like di&s;orders, and prove it &s;ucce&s;sful, it will yield the mo&s;t ample recom|pence and the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction for this commu|nication.</P>

<HEAD>Ca&s;e of an Haemateme&s;is &s;ucce&s;sfully treated. By Dr. Samuel Ne&s;bitt. Read <DATE>April <HI>6</HI>th, <HI>1785.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<P>ON the 13th of November, 1773. about 9'clock A. M. I was called, to vi&s;it Capt. Noble Hinman, aged 40, of a very plethoric ha|bit, who was &s;eized &s;uddenly with a violent and copious di&s;charge of blood from the &s;tomach. The &s;ymptoms preceding, were, a &s;en&s;e of fulne&s;s in the &s;tomach, or rather an encrea&s;ing di&s;tention thereof, which was &s;oon followed with a nau&s;ea, and a di&s;charge of blood from the &s;tomach by vo|mit, to the quantity of above two quarts, as the by&s;tanders judged. In this &s;tage of the com|plaint, I received the call, and found the patient languid, and &s;en&s;ibly affected with the lo&s;s of blood; his vomiting had cea&s;ed before I arrived. Notwith&s;tanding, I immediately bled him to the quantity of &s;ixteen ounces, gave him an opiate pill, pre&s;crib'd an a&s;tringent infu&s;ion, and the decoctum corticis, with elixir vitriol. I directed all his drinks to be &s;trongly acidulated, to be given cold, and in &s;mall quantities.</P>
<P>I remained with my patient two hours, and in con&s;equence of a return of the &s;ickne&s;s, and vom|iting of blood (to the quantity of about two pounds by e&s;timation) I again let blood, to the amount of twelve ounces.&mdash;I vi&s;ited my patient at one P. M. found him more &s;en&s;ibly affected by the lo&s;s of blood, and although no return of the vomiting, yet there had been a di&s;charge of blood by &s;tool, procured by an enema previou&s;ly admini&s;tered. His countenance from being remarkably florid, was now become very pale, yet the evident con|tinuance of the hoemorrhage and a ten&s;ion of the pul&s;e, exceeding the then apparent &s;tandard of
<PB N="30" REF="021296_0029_0FB304ADE7A43180">
&s;afety, emboldened me to let blood again, to the amount of fourteen ounces; his medicines were continued, and the anodyne pill directed to be repeated occa&s;ionally, if the vomiting re|turned: I then informed my patient and his friends, that I could promi&s;e no relief in the pre|&s;ent ca&s;e, unle&s;s I could reduce my patient to that &s;tate of weakne&s;s, by the lancet, which might to them appear alarming, and pre&s;erve, or rather &s;u&s;pend him in that &s;tate, until the ruptured blood ve&s;&s;els collap&s;ed, and the a&s;tringent medi|cines might have time to effect the con&s;triction of the bleeding orifice. My patient and his friends acquie&s;ced; of cour&s;e no cordial of the vinous or &s;timulating kind, was, in this &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e, admini&s;tered; except what cordial was received by the decoctum corticis. At five, P. M. vi&s;ited my patient; he complained, while I was pre&s;ent, of a return of the &s;en&s;e of fulne&s;s, which was &s;oon &s;ucceeded by a very copious vom|iting of blood. I held a large wa&s;h-hand ba&s;on, capable of containing three pints, to receive the contents of the &s;tomach, which ve&s;&s;el he fill'd, and, continuing to vomit, it ran over, at lea&s;t a pint, on the floor. I then judged, that at lea&s;t one half the quantity di&s;charged was blood. It was ob&s;ervable, in this and the two preceding turns of vomiting, that the nau&s;ea, and con&s;equent vomit|ing was excited by the previous accumulation of blood in his &s;tomach. I immediately gave an anodyne pill, continued in &s;mall quantities the decoct. corticis, and a&s;tringent infu&s;ion, with the cold drinks &s;paringly admini&s;tered, and let blood again, to the amount of 12 oz. for the fourth time between nine in the morning and &s;even in the eve|ning of the &s;ame day. Notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e
<PB N="31" REF="021296_0030_0FB304B10B1AF0F8">
evacuations, by haemorrhage and the lancet, no &s;yncope en&s;ued, only a de&s;irable languor. I again vi&s;ited my patient at late bed time, found no re|turn of the vomiting, nor &s;ymptoms that indicated a fre&s;h haemorrhage; the &s;ame regimen was direct|ed through the night, with his drink &s;trongly aci|dulated, and with this caution, to be given in &s;mall quantities, and frequently.</P>
<P>On the 14th, early in the morning, I vi&s;ited him; found his pul&s;e a little fuller, and exceeding the &s;tandard of &s;afety I had propo&s;ed. I again let blood, to the amount of fourteen ounces, which evacuation he endured without &s;yncope; the for|mer regimen and medicine was per&s;i&s;ted in, ex|cept the pills. At 10 A. M. I repeated my vi&s;it, my patient had a di&s;charge by &s;tool, principally coagulated blood; as he had no returns of vomit|ing as yet, and had retained the decoct. corticis, &amp;c. I &s;till found his pul&s;e not &s;o languid as I wi&s;hed, I therefore let blood to the amount of twelve ounces: and complaining of &s;ome griping unea&s;ine&s;s in his bowels, I directed an emollient enema, and an opiate pill by the mouth, with a continuation of the former medicines, &amp;c. I vi&s;ited him in the evening, no return of the vo|miting, but found by the operation of the enema, directed in the forenoon, that a quantity of co|agulated blood was di&s;charged. I again let blood to the amount of twelve ounces, and gave an ano|dyne pill, he bore this la&s;t bleeding as formerly, without fainting, and continued the other medi|cines with the &s;ame precaution as before.</P>
<P>On the 15th I vi&s;ited him, found no return of the hoemorrhage by any evident &s;ymptom, there|fore continued the decoct. corticis, &amp;c. without the anodyne.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="021296_0031_0FB304B32C789138">On the 16th, vi&s;ited him, beginning to recruit a little, having had no return of the haemorr|hage, I thought it advi&s;eable to &s;u&s;pend the a&s;|tringent medicines, and interpo&s;e a lenient purge of manna only, which operated gently, and pro|duced a di&s;charge of &s;ome coagulated blood, which, apparently from its colour, was not pro|duced by a recent haemorrhage.</P>
<P>On the 18th, finding no return of the haemorr|hage, and judging that the ruptured ve&s;&s;el, or ve&s;&s;els, were &s;ufficiently coale&s;ced, I indulged my patient in a little more nutritious regimen, and ordered a continuance of the decoct. cort. as a re&s;torative. The treatment, by God's ble&s;&s;ing, had the de&s;ired effect, and the patient, within three weeks from the fir&s;t attack, was able to return to his ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s, and enjoyed his u&s;ual &s;tate of health.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t acknowledge, gentlemen, that in the ca&s;e now recited, although the plan adopted ap|peared to me rational, yet it was not put in ex|ecution without much concern, lea&s;t my patient &s;hould mi&s;carry, and of cour&s;e my bold practice be &s;everely cen&s;ured; however, this with many other in&s;tances I have met with, to prove the power of the lancet in &s;imilar ca&s;es, has &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed on me the importance of blood letting. The indi&s;criminate u&s;e of a&s;tringents in haemorr|hages, and the good effects of blood letting, af|ford &s;ufficient matter for animadver&s;ion, but at pre&s;ent I will take up no more of your time: another opportunity, perhaps, may produce &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the&s;e &s;ubjects from me, or &s;ome abler pen. At pre&s;ent my de&s;ign is an&s;wered by a bare recital of a matter of fact.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="021296_0032_0FB304B6219BAB10">It is worthy of remark, that the patient lo&s;t, in about thirty-&s;ix hours, ninety-two ounces of blood by the lancet; and I am confident, by the mo&s;t moderate calculation, double that quantity by haemorrhage.

<HEAD>Ca&s;e of an Enteritis. By Dr. Ebenezer Beard&s;ley. Read before the Society, <DATE>April <HI>5, 1786.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<P>THAT article in our con&s;titution, which o|bliges every member of the &s;ociety, to ex|hibit a hi&s;tory of all the remarkable ca&s;es which occur in his practice, mu&s;t, if duly ob&s;erved, conduce in the highe&s;t degree to promote the de&s;ign and end of our in&s;titution. If we are faith|ful, accurate and per&s;evering in our ob&s;ervations, we &s;hall &s;oon be furni&s;hed with a number of facts and hi&s;tories, which at &s;ome future period may be very intere&s;ting and beneficial to the public, and do honor to the &s;ociety. It is much to be regretted that hitherto, the faculty, in this coun|try, have contributed &s;o little to the general &s;tock of medical knowledge. Our predece&s;&s;ors would have rendered an important piece of &s;ervice to us, and to future generations, if they had made and tran&s;mitted down, faithful hi&s;tories of the di&s;|ea&s;es which prevailed in their times.</P>
<P>The dy&s;entery, ulcerous &s;ore throat, and mo&s;t of the other di&s;ea&s;es which have been epidemical in this country, have been attended with pretty long intervals, during which the di&s;ea&s;es have not appeared at all, or in but a few in&s;tances: con&s;equently, on a general return of any of them, mo&s;t of the practitioners who had been conver|&s;ant

with them being dead, and having left no ob&s;ervations on record for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and in|&s;truction of &s;ucceeding practitioners, tho&s;e di&s;|ea&s;es have been almo&s;t as new and &s;trange, and the proper mode of treating them as uncertain as though they had never occurred before. It can|not be doubted, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, that many valuable lives have been lo&s;t, before the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e has been under&s;tood, and a proper mode of treatment a&s;certained. From whence it is probable the common and well known ob&s;ervation aro&s;e, that a new di&s;ea&s;e is more fatal on its fir&s;t acce&s;&s;ion, than in its advanced progre&s;s and later &s;tages. For a number of years part, we have been &s;o happy as not to be vi&s;ited with any epidemic di&s;ea&s;e: but I well remember, when the ulcerous &s;ore throat made its appearance about fifteen years ago, that there was not among my acquaintance, but one or two phy&s;icians, who had ever &s;een it before; which was al&s;o the ca&s;e with re&s;pect to the dy&s;entery. We ought to e&s;|teem it a peculiar happine&s;s, that we have now an opportunity, and have already made a hopeful beginning in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a new aera in the healing art. With proper attention, &s;hould our country have the misfortune to be vi&s;ited again with any kind of epidemic di&s;ea&s;e, it will be in our power to mark its origin, progre&s;s, effects, and termination, and to hand down to &s;ucceed|ing generations, a faithful hi&s;tory of the mode of treatment, &s;ucce&s;s, and every other circum&s;tance of importance.</P>
<P>With a view to contribute by example, as well as precept, to this important de&s;ign, I now lay before you a ca&s;e, which, from the violence of its acce&s;&s;ion, rapid progre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;udden and fatal termi|nation, appeared to de&s;erve attention.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="021296_0034_0FB304BA57A40C38">JOHN CHAPPEL, a healthy, &s;prightly boy, five years of age, on his return from &s;chool, at noon, on Friday the 24th of June, 1785, was &s;eized with &s;ickne&s;s at his &s;tomach, and vomit|ing, which was &s;oon after &s;ucceeded with thir&s;t, heat, and re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s. The&s;e &s;ymptoms continued through the afternoon and night, during which time he ejected every thing he took into his &s;to|mach, and in the cour&s;e of the night and next morning, brought up ten large worms of the round kind. On Saturday morning I fir&s;t vi&s;ited him, at which time his pul&s;e was extremely quick, &s;mall, and unequal; his countenance pale and &s;unk, his re&s;piration quick and laborious, and he was &s;o re&s;tle&s;s that it was with difficulty that his attendants kept him on the bed; his thir&s;t was great, but he almo&s;t in&s;tantly threw up whatever was given to him. Nothing had pa&s;&s;ed his bow|els &s;ince he was fir&s;t taken ill, but his abdomen was not at all tumefied but rather contracted. He had his &s;en&s;es perfectly, but did not complain of pain in his bowels, or el&s;ewhere. I pre&s;cribed magne&s;. alb. the neutral mixtures, and other an|tiemetics, with emollient fomentations, enemas, and &s;mall do&s;es of calomel through the day, but without any good effect. At evening the &s;ymptoms were much increa&s;ed, at which time, Dr. Ne&s;bitt, at my de&s;ire, was called in to con&s;ult his ca&s;e. We both judged it to be a worm ca&s;e, joined with inflammation from their irritation. The fomentations, enemas, calomel, &amp;c. were continued, and epi&s;pa&s;tics were applied to his extremities. In the night his vomiting abated, &s;o that he retained the medicines and drinks which were admini&s;tered to him untill his &s;tomach &s;eemed to be overloaded, when they wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="36" REF="021296_0035_0FB304BB63B00C20">
ejected to appearance from that cau&s;e. On Sunday morning we vi&s;ited him again, but though the vomiting was not &s;o frequent, his dejected coun|tenance, difficulty of re&s;piration, weak, quick, unequal pul&s;e, and cold extremities, indicated his approaching di&s;&s;olution. He died at eleven o'clock this morning. No evacuation was ob|tained from the bowels, during the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, by the many injections which were u&s;ed, aided by the calomel, &amp;c. On the afternoon of the &s;ame day, I obtained permi&s;&s;ion from the pa|rents, to open the body, in company with Dr. Ne&s;bitt and my brother. We found but one worm in the whole inte&s;tinal canal. The abdomi|nal vi&s;cera were all &s;ound and well conditioned, except about two inches of the lower part of the duodenum, or upper part of the jejunum, which was inflamed and &s;phacelated, which appeared clearly to be the cau&s;e of his death. From the di&s;&s;ection it appears, that the di&s;ea&s;e was origin|ally a true enteritis, or inflammation of the bowels, and it is highly probable that the worms were not at all concerned in the production of it; but being di&s;turbed by the increa&s;ed heat and di&s;|agreeablene&s;s of their &s;ituation, quitted it in &s;earch of a better. It al&s;o appears from this hi&s;|tory and di&s;&s;ection, that we ought not implicitly to tru&s;t tho&s;e authors and others, who are too apt to con&s;ider all di&s;ea&s;es of the inte&s;tines in child|ren, as ari&s;ing from worms. Such a pre-con|ceived opinion will be likely to blind us, with re|&s;pect to the real cau&s;e, if it &s;hould be of a differ|ent nature, and mi&s;lead us perhaps fatally in our pre&s;criptions. Allen, in his Synop&s;is, advi&s;es the practitioner in treating the di&s;ea&s;es of children, if he meets with any &s;ymptoms he cannot readily
<PB N="37" REF="021296_0036_0FB304BD4608B168">
account for, to place it to the account of worms. But this advice was certainly unbecoming a phi|lo&s;opher and phy&s;ician. It is much more &s;afe and honourable to imitate the example of the great Boerhaave, who a&s;&s;ures us that he made it an in|variable rule, never to quit the bed-&s;ide of his patient, until he had fully a&s;certained the &s;tate and condition of all the important vi&s;cera. All the common &s;ymptoms of worms in the inte&s;tines, &s;uch as lo&s;s of appetite, acidity, pains in the ab|domen, alternate bound and loo&s;e body, &s;limy and fetid &s;tools, grinding the teeth, erratic fever, &amp;c. may ari&s;e from an increa&s;ed quantity of mucus in the inte&s;tines, ob&s;tructions in the me&s;|enteric glands, and dentition. Symptoms of a &s;imilar kind, are al&s;o ob&s;erved in other di&s;ea&s;es remote from this organ, particularly in the hydroce|phalus internus. How ab&s;urd then, and danger|ous mu&s;t it be, to treat di&s;ea&s;es in the &s;ame me|thod, that are &s;o di&s;&s;imilar in their cau&s;es and &s;eat, merely becau&s;e there happens to be a &s;imi|larity in &s;ome of the &s;ymptoms! Notwith&s;tand|ing the great &s;imilarity in the &s;ymptoms of &s;ome di&s;ea&s;es, there cannot be a doubt but what every di&s;ea&s;e has its own pathognomonic or di&s;tingui&s;h|ing &s;igns, by which it may be di&s;criminated, by the attentive and &s;killful phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the other &s;ymptoms which are com|mon to worms, and the hydrocephalus, the &s;low pul&s;e, and dilated pupil of the eyes, are &s;triking marks by which the latter di&s;ea&s;e may be readily known.</P>
<P>Dr. Home of Edinburgh, in his clinical ex|periments affirms, that he di&s;covered &s;ixteen years before he publi&s;hed tho&s;e experiments, a certain diagno&s;tic &s;ymptom of worms, which in all that

time had never failed him; which is, an oedema|tous &s;welling of the alae narium, upper lip, and often of the contiguous parts of the cheeks; the apertures of the no&s;trils are al&s;o dimini&s;hed at lea&s;t the half of their natural &s;ize. Since I read his ob&s;ervations, I have &s;een a few worm patients, which I apprehended were &s;welled in the manner he de&s;cribes, but I could not &s;atisfy my&s;elf fully; the &s;ubject de&s;erves farther attention. I &s;hall con|clude the&s;e remarks, with this practical caution, that in all ca&s;es that are attended with heat, thir&s;t and a fever, though we may have ocular proof that the patient is troubled with worms, we ought to be circum&s;pect in the admini&s;tration of hot, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, &s;timulating &s;ub&s;tances, however much they may be celebrated for their anthelmintic virtues.</P>

<HEAD>Ca&s;e of a deformed Foetus. By Dr. Leverett Hub|bard. Read before the Society, <DATE>April <HI>5</HI>th, <HI>1786.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<P>IN the year 1786, I was called to a gentlewo|man in the &s;ixth month of ge&s;tation. I found her attended with a &s;trong pain in her brea&s;t, and left &s;ide of the abdomen: flooding largely. I examined the &s;tate of the os uteri, found it not dilated in the lea&s;t, but tumefied and very hard; no pre&s;&s;ure from her pains. I immediately let blood, which abated the flooding, but not the pain. I pre&s;cribed her an anodyne, which gave no relief: in two hours I gave her another do&s;e, which moderated the pain a little. I tarried all night, and in the morning I found the whole of the abdomen &s;welled to a prodigious &s;ize, with
<PB N="39" REF="021296_0038_0FB304C010431600">
high fever and inflammation. I ordered a fomenta|tion of bitter herbs, which abated the tumour and inflammation in &s;ome mea&s;ure; after which came on a nau&s;ea, and vomiting of a green bilious fluid, in quantity about three quarts. I gave her large do&s;es of the fel. vip. which abated the vomiting; &s;oon after came on an univer&s;al lan|guor and faintne&s;s; &s;he remained in that &s;tate the greater part of the day. After the faintne&s;s abated, &s;he complained of a coldne&s;s of the abdo|men, which on examination I found to be ex|treme: this alarmed me, the pul&s;e at the &s;ame time being very low. I gave her a little wine whey repeatedly, which accelerated the motion of the blood, rai&s;ed the pul&s;e, and cau&s;ed an increa&s;e of heat through the whole body, except the abdomen. Her pain left her; I repeated the fomentation with the addition of a little &s;pirits, and the wine whey to be given now and then, and left her. In about twelve hours I was called again, her pain returning; I examined the &s;tate of the os uteri, I found it a little dilated. Soon after a violent flooding came on: I judged that her pre&s;ent circum&s;tances required a &s;peedy de|livery. By repeated trials I gently dilated the os uteri, &s;o as to introduce two of my fingers, with which I could feel the foetus. Its po&s;ition was preternatural; the abdomen fir&s;t pre&s;ented, as I judged, but was mi&s;taken. By further exami|nation, I found it could not be the abdomen, neither could it be the head, for it was not hard enough; my fir&s;t intention was to change its po|&s;ition, &s;o as to obtain the head, but could not by rea&s;on of a contraction attending every pain: after a little time obtained one of the feet, and &s;oon after the other, which gave me great encou|ragement of a &s;peedy delivery; I brought forward

the feet and legs, but to my great &s;urpri&s;e the bo|dy &s;topt. Then with my left hand extended the thighs of the foetus as far a&s;under as I could, and &s;lipt the two fore fingers of my right hand, in order to obtain the extremity of the inte&s;tinum rectum. But to my a&s;toni&s;hment, I found there was no inte&s;tinum rectum, but the &s;ame feeling below the thighs as there was in the fir&s;t touch, as I mentioned before, which proved to be the pendulous body whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> pre&s;ented to the birth, as delineated in the plate.</P>

<P>Finding I could do nothing that way, I then returned the legs into their former po&s;ition, and by repeated trials, turned the child &s;o as to feel one of the hands, after that the &s;houlder, and then the head which I cau&s;ed to pre&s;ent, and &s;oon after that obtained a delivery in the natu|ral way.</P>
<P>I &s;hould not have troubled you with this ca&s;e, if the formation of the foetus had not been very

&s;ingular. The be&s;t de&s;cription I can give you is this; as I ob&s;erved before, it was in the &s;ixth month of ge&s;tation, the foetus as large as u&s;ual. The child, from the &s;utura coronalis down to the lowe&s;t or la&s;t true ribs was natural, except that the cranium was uncovered; upon the left, from the &s;utura coronalis, down to the &s;utura &s;quamo|&s;a and &s;utura tran&s;ver&s;alis, except a pericranium. I &s;hall next proceed to the thighs; the end of the os femoris was rather flat than round, no os inno|minatum but a ligament formed, fa&s;tened to the vertebrae immediately below the la&s;t true ribs, the ligament being about an inch long, gave liberty for the thighs and legs to move exactly as a &s;wingle is moved by the motion of its &s;taff. A little below the joining of the thighs to the verte|brae, there was a neck formed a little larger than that on the &s;houlders, to which was formed a head as large as that of the natural, con&s;i&s;ting of cere|brum and cerebellum, not contained in a crani|um but a cartilaginous ca&s;e, with a dura mater; which was &s;eparate from the cartilaginous ca&s;e, and covered with a &s;kin, or &s;calp, as u&s;ual, but no hair. Upon the right &s;ide of this fal&s;e head (if I may &s;o call it) appeared three &s;mall perfo|rations or inlets, placed in a triangular form, and were about an inch and an half from each other; two of which were about as large as a rye &s;traw, the other of an oval, about one fourth of an inch long, which was lower than the other. I intro|duced a probe into the &s;mall perforations fir&s;t, and found they did not extend more than half an inch; the other which I founded extended two or three inches in an a&s;cending direction, which with my knife, I laid open, and found it to be a &s;mall tube or canal, a little re&s;embling the oe&s;o|phagus
<PB N="42" REF="021296_0041_0FB304C61106C7A8">
by its wicker like &s;tructure; it extended no farther an entire tube, but was divided into a number of fine tubes or fibres, which were lo&s;t in that which I called the cerebellum, or medullary &s;ub&s;tance. The left leg was flat, having two ti|bias and two fibulas articulated about half way from the patella to the ancle.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have proceeded further in my di&s;&s;ection and enquiry, but was &s;uddenly called off.</P>

<HEAD>On the fatal Effects of the Corro&s;ive Sublimate of Mercury. Communicated by Doctor Levi Ives. Read <DATE>February <HI>7</HI>th, <HI>1787.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<P>ON Friday, Dec. 29th, 1785, Mr. I. S. nineteen years of age, through an unhap|py mi&s;take of his own, &s;wallowed four grains of the corro&s;ive &s;ublimate of mercury, di&s;&s;olved in a &s;mall quantity of water, which very &s;oon exci|ted a violent vomiting and purging, with inten&s;e pains and griping. It was about thirty hours af|ter he took the fatal do&s;e, when I fir&s;t vi&s;ited him. I found him attended with a con&s;tant nau&s;ea, and purging of a &s;anguineous mucus, with a quick, low pul&s;e, great thir&s;t, a mo&s;t intolerable cardial|gia, and griping. I directed a cooling purge, and to dilute plentifully with an infu&s;ion of viol|ets, together with an infu&s;ion of gum arabic, which was taken freely, but without any mitigation of his complaints. Sunday morning found him as above de&s;cribed, and no alteration for the better. On Monday finding him &s;inking under his com|plaints,
<PB N="43" REF="021296_0042_0FB304C8E3FB74D0">
directed to the u&s;e of ol. ric. with barley water and nitre, which gave &s;ome relief to his griping. Tue&s;day, January 1&s;t, his purging and gripings much abated, yet attended with a very quick, low pul&s;e, cardialgia, and great thir&s;t. The pre&s;criptions of Monday were continued, and as his pains became erratic and more univer&s;al, I di|rected an anodyne for the night, tho' with little advantage. Wedne&s;day his di&s;tre&s;s became &s;till more univer&s;al, the &s;ame medicines were continu|ed, with an anodyne at evening, which procured &s;ome re&s;t. Thur&s;day the 3d, found him di&s;tre&s;&s;|ed with the forementioned &s;ymptoms, and nature evidently &s;inking. Friday the 4th, came on a &s;mall haemorrhage from the no&s;e, with a &s;ingultus and a great acerbation of all the &s;ymptoms. Sa|turday and Sunday following no material alterati|on, except a manife&s;t decay of &s;trength. On Monday came on a profu&s;e haemorrhage from the no&s;e, which continued until death clo&s;ed the &s;cene, which was on the eleventh day from re|ceiving the fatal do&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>The fatal effects of drinking cold water, when hea|ted. Communicated by Doctor Samuel Ne&s;bitt. Read <DATE>April <HI>4</HI>th, <HI>1787.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<P>ON the 11th of Augu&s;t, 1774, I was called to vi&s;it Jo&s;eph Kent, a labouring man, a|ged 45, of a robu&s;t habit. The account he gave of him&s;elf was, that a few days before, when warm with work, he had drank about a quart of cold water, after a hearty dinner of fi&s;h, the imme|diate effects of which were great di&s;tre&s;s at the pit of his &s;tomach, a trembling and difficulty of
<PB N="44" REF="021296_0043_0FB304CB50B9B530">
breathing, with faintne&s;s; the trembling and faint|ne&s;s went off &s;oon, but the difficulty of breath|ing and pain, increa&s;ed, extending over the whole hypocondriac region, &s;o as to give him the idea of cholic, which idea he retained through the whole di&s;ea&s;e, notwith&s;tanding every per|&s;ua&s;ion on my part, and the plaine&s;t indications to the contrary, as every enema and aperient in the cour&s;e of of the di&s;ea&s;e operated readily. A phy&s;ician was called immediately who had pre|&s;cribed a lenient purge and &s;edatives; but with|out relief. I do not recollect whether venae&s;ecti|on was premi&s;ed; but I think it mo&s;t probably was before my vi&s;it, which was on the 4th or 5th day of the attack. I found him with every &s;ympt|om of an extended and high inflammation, great di&s;tre&s;s and difficulty of re&s;piration, accompanied with a &s;evere &s;ingultus, and extreme pain in the re|gion of the liver. I immediately let blood from the arm copiou&s;ly, which was repeated often and occa|&s;ionally, without any permanent relief. For &s;everal days the mo&s;t rigid antiphlogi&s;tic cour&s;e was pur&s;u|ed, epi&s;pa&s;tics were applied &amp; renewed to the co&s;tae, &s;ternum, and parts adjacent, gentle cathartics &amp; ene|mas were admini&s;tered, with the de&s;ired effect as eva|cuants. Fotu&s;es of emollient herbs were repeatedly u&s;ed, with now and then a gentle anodyne as a pla|cebo. But the whole that was obtained from a bold antiphlogi&s;tic cour&s;e, was a prevention of gangrene in the inflamed vi&s;cera, and of cour&s;e a le&s;s &s;peedy termination of the di&s;ea&s;e. The i&s;&s;ue was a &s;uppura|tion of the inflamed parts, probably about the 15th day of the di&s;ea&s;e. When &s;ymptoms of the hectic kind came on, and a formation of pus, the pains grew more tolerable, and an apparent di&s;ten&s;ion began in the right hypochondrium, which in the
<PB N="45" REF="021296_0044_0FB304CE5C5FC370">
&s;equel, about two days before his death, became prominent a little below and to the right of the cartilago en&s;iformis, with a fluctuation about the time of his death, evident to the touch. Death was &s;o evidently near at hand, that I expected no relief to the patient nor credit to my&s;elf would ar|i&s;e from a puncture of the ab&s;ce&s;s, and therefore deferred it until di&s;&s;ection. On the ce&s;&s;ation of the inflammatory &s;ymptoms, and the commence|ment of the hectic, the antiphlogi&s;tic cour&s;e was exchanged for a regimen of the nutritious and re&s;torative kind, with a light preparation of the bark. The patient finding no pro&s;pect of relief from any remedies I had applied, and &s;till retain|ing the idea of cholic, as before recited, di&s;patch|ed a me&s;&s;enger for a famous cholic doctor re&s;iding in a neighbouring town, without my knowledge. I was informed, however, before the doctor's ar|rival, and de&s;ired the nur&s;e to let me know that I might attend and &s;tate the ca&s;e to him previous to his attempting any thing for the patient. The doctor arrived about ten, in the night of the 4th of September, and immeditely pronounced the di&s;ea&s;e to be the cholic. I in vain endeavoured to remove every idea of the kind from his mind; contrary to my remon&s;trances, he was put under a cour&s;e of &s;trong aloetic purges, combin'd with ar|omatics, commonly called Hull's bitter powders. The operation was violent, and he died on the 6th, about thirty days from the fir&s;t attack.</P>
<P>The appearance of the body, on di&s;&s;ection, was as follows. On puncturing the ab&s;ce&s;s ex|tending from the liver, a &s;tream of pus i&s;&s;ued to a di&s;tance from the body; when the vi&s;cera were expo&s;ed to view, the liver was found to have been greatly di&s;tended with pus, from whence
<PB N="46" REF="021296_0045_0FB304CFEBA1B938">
the aforementioned tumour was formed, by a di&s;ten&s;ion of the peritoneum and intervening te|guments; it was a ma&s;s of corruption, and its &s;ub&s;tance di&s;charged by that and &s;everal &s;maller ab&s;ce&s;&s;es: the lower &s;urface of the diaphragm was over&s;pread with numbers of &s;mall tumours, of the &s;ize of nutmegs and hazel nuts containing pus; the media&s;tinum and the pericardium in a &s;imilar &s;tate, but the tumours &s;maller. In the place of lymph, in the cavity of the pericardium, there was found a purulent matter to a con&s;iderable number of ounces: The heart's &s;urface was co|vered or encru&s;ted like the di&s;tinct &s;mall-pox in a &s;tate of complete maturation, or a day or two pa&s;t that period: the external &s;urface of each lobe of the lungs was affected by previous inflamma|tion, and matter was contained in the right cavity of the thorax, which communicated by an opening through the diaphragm with an ab&s;ce&s;s in the liver.</P>

<P>IN the morning of the 24th of June, 1774, I was called to vi&s;it Mrs. R&mdash;, aged thirty-eight years, in con&s;ultation with Dr. Bontecou. We found the patient &s;itting up, leaning her el|bows on a pillow, &s;upported by a &s;tand, and in that po&s;ture labouring for breath, with an emaci|ated countenance, feeble pul&s;e, and every &s;ymp|tom of great debility, unable to lay in a &s;upine po&s;ture, having thus pa&s;&s;ed her days and nights for &s;ome time, except now and then on a bed bol&s;|ered up: the patient was then pregnant, and
<PB N="47" REF="021296_0046_0FB304D1EA763D40">
about the &s;ixth or &s;eventh month of ge&s;tation. The di&s;ea&s;e had been gradually increa&s;ing for about two years, with this addition, that in the period of ge&s;tation the &s;ymptoms were much ag|gravated by her increa&s;e of bulk; it appeared to us impo&s;&s;ible &s;he could endure thro' the remaining period of ge&s;tation, if the &s;ymptoms increa&s;ed with the bulk, even if her &s;trength would have admit|ted; but as the ca&s;e then was, the &s;ituation of our patient was truly deplorable; however, we had not much time to deliberate on the ca&s;e, for on the evening of the &s;ame day, premature labour came on; Dr. Hubbard was joined in the coun|cil, and delivered her in a few hours: we then hoped for an abatement of the &s;ymptoms, but none were obtained; every effort was made for her re|lief and recovery, but &s;he died on the evening of the 30th.</P>
<P>We viewed the ca&s;e as an empyema, and re|que&s;ted liberty of the relatives to open the body, but with great reluctance on their part, obtained leave to puncture the thorax. I punctured the right cavity of the thorax, but no fluid i&s;&s;ued, I did not proceed to puncture the left, le&s;t I &s;hould fail in finding a fluid contained, which was the apology made to the relatives; but loth to &s;top our enquiries, I enlarged the puncture a little with a &s;calpel, &s;o as to introduce my finger, and found it ob&s;tructed in its cour&s;e by a hard body; we enlarged the opening in the cour&s;e of the rib and di&s;tinctly felt a hard fle&s;hy &s;ub&s;tance, in form and &s;hape like a pine apple, crouding up along the right cavity of the thorax, and pre&s;&s;ing &s;trongly the right lobe of the lungs upwards, and again&s;t the media&s;tinum. The tumour was a &s;chirrhous enlargement of the liver, in form and
<PB N="48" REF="021296_0047_0FB304D362AE47D8">
about the &s;ize of a moderate pine-apple, with its apex projecting into the cavity of the thorax, and carrying by di&s;ten&s;ion that portion of the dia|phragm oppo&s;ed to its &s;uperior point, and reach|ing at lea&s;t to midway of the cavity: we were anxious to pu&s;h our enquiries further, and to have examined more minutely into the &s;tate of the affect|ed vi&s;cus and other of the vi&s;cera, but the rela|tives would not admit of any further defa|cing of the corps, as they called it.</P>
<P>From the&s;e circum&s;tances, Gentlemen, thus di&s;covered as it were by accident, the inve&s;ti|gation of the cau&s;e of our decea&s;ed patient's com|plaint and its gradual acce&s;&s;ion, was apparent; the aggravated &s;ymptoms from ge&s;tation by the increa&s;e of the uterus, and its con&s;equent pre&s;&s;ure on the &s;uperior and affected vi&s;cus, were likewi&s;e ea&s;y to be accounted for, and that no &s;ub&s;tantial relief was derived from delivery, we were at no lo&s;s to determine, all being deducible from the grand and proximate cau&s;e, the unnatural di&s;ten|&s;ion and elevation of the diaphragm; the interrup|tion of the &s;ame mu&s;cular partition, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary in both acts of re&s;piration; and the occupying by the tumour the greater part of that cavity pre|pared for the free action of the right lobe of the lungs.</P>
<P>From the hi&s;tory of this &s;ingular and unfortu|nate ca&s;e, there appears no aera at which we could promi&s;e any &s;ucce&s;sful mode of treatment; at the time I &s;aw the patient, the ca&s;e was irremediable, and I am led to conclude that at no period of the di&s;ea&s;e when the complaint of the a&s;thma became apparent, was their much, if any chance for re|lief, as undoubtedly the &s;chirrhous had obtained &s;ome con&s;iderable &s;ize before the difficulty of

<P>FRIDAY, January 13, 1787, Polly Edwards, daughter of Pierpont Edwards, E&s;q. of this city, aged five years and three months, was &s;eiz|ed with thir&s;t, and re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s; the next day &s;he was &s;omething feveri&s;h, and dull, but play'd abroad. At night her complaints returned, and &s;he was feveri&s;h and re&s;tle&s;s through the night. Sunday, Monday and Tue&s;day, &s;he complained of a &s;orene&s;s in her head, which was &s;o great as to be much affected from a &s;light touch; &s;he was al&s;o attended with a con&s;tant head-ach, and for the mo&s;t part was dull and &s;leepy, but had turns of anxiety and re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s: her thir&s;t contin|ued, and her countenance was very florid. On Wedne&s;day, her di&s;order was &s;o increa&s;ed that &s;he became confined to her bed. Thur&s;day night &s;he was very re&s;tle&s;s, her &s;leep was much di&s;turb|ed and &s;he frequently cried out that &s;ome body pulled her hair. Her weakne&s;s increa&s;ed &s;o that &s;he became unable to bear her own weight, her eyes appeared bright, &s;hining, and inflamed; &s;he picked her no&s;e, and often put her hands up to her face and head. She had no appetite for food from the beginning; &s;he voided three worms in con&s;equence of a purge of mercurius dulcis.
<PB N="50" REF="021296_0049_0FB304D82537D500">
Friday and Saturday, her anxiety and re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s increa&s;ed, and &s;he frequently threw her hands round the back &s;ide of her head. Sunday her pul&s;e, which, from the beginning, had been quick, full and &s;trong, became remarkably weak and &s;mall; and &s;he totally lo&s;t her &s;peech, which returned no more.</P>
<P>This evening I &s;aw her for the fir&s;t time, in com|pany with the Doctors Prime and Mun&s;on, the former of whom, had attended her from the fir&s;t acce&s;&s;ion of the di&s;order. Her face was very florid, and a little bloated, her eyes inflamed, weeping, and the pupils dilated, the pul&s;e was very &s;mall and weak, &s;o as hardly to be perceiv|ed, but not remarkably quick, her extremities were cold, but her head, e&s;pecially the hinder parts of it, were very hot; &s;he had little or no thir&s;t; &s;he had frequent turns of the greate&s;t anxiety and di&s;tre&s;s imaginable, during which, &s;he writhed her body, threw off the bed clothes, grated her teeth, &s;tarted up on end in the bed, and clench|ed her hands round the back&s;ide of her head. In the intervals between the&s;e paroxi&s;ms, &s;he lay quite ea&s;y and compo&s;ed, looked about, and took notice of the people and things around her. Her rea&s;on did not appear to be at all impaired; &s;he appeared to know every per&s;on of her ac|quaintance who came into the room, put out her tongue readily when de&s;ired, for the in&s;pection of her phy&s;icians, &amp;c. which continued till near the clo&s;ing &s;cene. In her intervals of ea&s;e, &s;he lay upon her back, with her feet drawn up. In her paroxi&s;ms of di&s;tre&s;s, her eyes were convul&s;ed. Through the whole of this week her angui&s;h and di&s;tre&s;s continued to increa&s;e, her extremities be|came as cold as a corp&s;e, her pul&s;e was quick,
<PB N="51" REF="021296_0050_0FB304DC61CB5630">
weak, and &s;o &s;mall as &s;carcely to be perceptible; yet her head remained hot, and her cheeks high|ly coloured to the la&s;t. On Sunday morning &s;he expired without a &s;truggle or a groan. Pur|ges of merc. dulc. with &s;enna, rheubarb, and the Carolina pink root, had been the principal medicines. The&s;e were &s;ucceeded by fomenta|tions, &s;emicupium, bli&s;ters, wine and other cor|dials.</P>
<P>Dr. P. who attended the patient from the fir&s;t acce&s;&s;ion of the di&s;order, had con&s;idered it as a worm ca&s;e, and notwith&s;tanding the di&s;&s;ent of the other phy&s;icians who were con&s;ulted, he main|tained his opinion with confidence to the la&s;t. To remove all doubts upon the &s;ubject, and to in|ve&s;tigate the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e, the body was in&s;pected in the afternoon of the &s;ame day. The inte&s;tines, which had been &s;uppo&s;ed to be the &s;eat of the di&s;ea&s;e, were entirely &s;ound, without a &s;ingle worm or any other morbid appearance; which was al&s;o the ca&s;e with the other vi&s;cera of the abdomen, and the thorax. Finding no morbid appearance in the thorax or abdomen, we proceeded to in&s;pect the brain. After the ex|ternal integuments were removed, the cranium was &s;awed off a little above the ears, and care|fully removed without injuring the dura mater, when with a &s;calpel, the upper part of the brain, with the &s;urrounding integuments down to the fir&s;t ventricle, were removed. The fir&s;t and &s;ec|ond ventricles, being laid open, exhibited no morbid appearance, but upon cutting into the third and fourth, five or &s;ix ounces of clear tran&s;|parent lymph flowed out, and ran into a ve&s;&s;el which was placed to receive it. The di&s;&s;ection was performed in the pre&s;ence of a number of the

faculty and others, who were fully &s;atisfied that this was the &s;eat of the di&s;ea&s;e, and that the pa|tient's death was occa&s;ioned by a compre&s;&s;ion of the brain, e&s;pecially the cerebelluum, from whence the remarkable failure and weakne&s;s of the vis vitae, lo&s;s of &s;peech &amp;c. which took place many days before death, though the animal functions remained found to the la&s;t: the rea&s;on of which is obvious from anatomy and phy&s;iology.</P>

<P>MRS. Sarah Tuttle, aged 64, had for &s;eve|ral years been afflicted with indige&s;tion, nau&s;ea, acidity, and heart-burn, with diarrhaea, and co&s;tivene&s;s alternately. Lime water, &s;oap, gum pills, bitters, and ab&s;orbents, which her phy&s;icians had occa&s;ionally pre&s;cribed for her, af|forded her a temporary relief, but the complaints often recurred, and increa&s;ed, &s;o as to render the la&s;t &s;ix or eight years of her life very uncomforta|ble. About the beginning of la&s;t July &s;he was taken down with a fever of the low depre&s;&s;ed kind, attended with headach, vertigo, &s;leeple&s;&s;ne&s;s, frequent &s;light rigors, and the u&s;ual complaints in her fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages. Augu&s;t the 10th, my advice was a&s;ked. She was much emaciated, had a low feeble pul&s;e, con&s;tant nau&s;ea, cardialgia, and &s;ickne&s;s at her &s;tomach, with frequent ejections of an acid, &s;limy fluid, the thru&s;h, and a trouble|&s;ome and wa&s;ting diarrhaea.</P>
<P>She was wholly de&s;titute of appetite, and had lit|tle or no quiet &s;leep. I pre&s;cribed watery infu&s;i|ons
<PB N="53" REF="021296_0052_0FB304E096BE4400">
of rheubarb, flowers of camomile, &s;nake-root, and other &s;tomachics, with the bark, and ano|dynes, which gave her great relief for &s;everal weeks. But the nau&s;ea and &s;ickne&s;s at &s;tomach returning, and finding no relief from &s;tomachics, antacids, or any other medicines, at her reque&s;t, on the &s;econd of September, I gave her about one &s;cruple of ipecacuanha, which operated mildly five or &s;ix times. But the next day the &s;ickne&s;s, &amp;c. returned, and &s;he was, in all re&s;pects, wor&s;e than before. After this I directed her to the u&s;e of porter, which abated the nau&s;ea and &s;ick|ne&s;s, but produced an intolerable burning and unea&s;ine&s;s in the &s;tomach, upon which it was laid a&s;ide. She continued &s;lowly declining, without any remarkable alteration in her &s;ymptoms, till Saturday the 12th in&s;tant, when &s;he died, at ab|out ten in the morning. The di&s;&s;ection was per|formed by Dr. Spalding, in the pre&s;ence of Dr. Darling, my brother, and my&s;elf, the next morn|ing. The thoracic vi&s;cera, liver, &s;pleen, omen|tum, and large inte&s;tines were in a &s;ound &s;tate. The &s;tomach was con&s;iderably di&s;tended, and fil|led with a fluid which re&s;embled chyle. At its lower orifice, there was an oblong &s;chirrous tum|our, of the &s;ize of a pullet's egg, and about two inches and an half in length, extending down|wards into the duodenum. The &s;chirrhus inve&s;t|ed the pylorus on all &s;ides, and was nearly three quarters of an inch thick.

The me&s;entery, and a con&s;iderable proportion of the &s;mall inte&s;tines were al&s;o in a &s;chirrhous &s;tate.

<HEAD>Ca&s;e of a &s;ingular Wound in the Eye, from the bur&s;ting of a Gun. By Dr. John Spalding. Read before the Society, <DATE>April <HI>2</HI>d, <HI>1788</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<P>MR. Ezra Curtis, aged twenty years, on the 18th of September, 1785, received a wound by the bur&s;ting of a mu&s;ket, the breech-pin of which, entering his right eye, drove the eye, with the whole of its bony orbit before it, un|til it was impeded in its progre&s;s by the vertebrae of the neck, and os maxilla inferior, or lower jaw. The &s;pine of the pin pa&s;&s;ing through the coracohyoidaeus and part of the ma&s;toides mu&s;|cles,
<PB N="55" REF="021296_0054_0FB304E7662E6230">
to the adipo&s;e membrane, without perfor|ating the &s;kin. The body of it was firmly wedged between the proce&s;&s;es of the vertebrae of the neck and the upper and outer angle of the lower jaw. The de&s;truction of &s;uch a number of large blood ve&s;&s;els producing a violent haemorrhage from the wound, no&s;trils and mouth, which was &s;ucceeded ed by a great degree of inflammation, and tu|mefaction of the face and neck, no &s;u&s;picion was entertained by the &s;urgeons who attended him, or any other per&s;on, that the pin had entered the eye, till &s;ix months after, when a &s;uppuration took place, and the tumour being opened, the pin was di&s;covered, to the great &s;urprize and a&s;to|ni&s;hment of the &s;urgeons and &s;pectators. After the inflamation and tumour &s;ub&s;ided, the end of the pin projected it&s;elf about three eighths of an inch beyond the &s;kin, where it remained immove|ably fixed, without admitting any change in its po&s;ition from the &s;tronge&s;t efforts that could be made, until May 31&s;t, when it was happily ex|tracted.</P>
<P>Upon his fir&s;t application to me, which was the fir&s;t of May, I dilated the wound as much as the nature of the parts would admit; and then with a pair of &s;trong forceps, attempted to turn the pin &s;o as to di&s;engage it; but after my utmo&s;t exertions I was obliged to relinqui&s;h the attempt, the ca&s;e being of &s;o &s;ingular a kind, and from the proximity of &s;uch a large number of blood ve&s;&s;els, attended with the utmo&s;t danger. On the 5th, I procured a con&s;ultation of the fa|culty belonging to the city, in which it was agreed to denude a part of the jaw bone, and with a &s;mall trephine cut out a piece oppo&s;ite to the pin, in the &s;hape of a cre&s;cent; this opera|tion
<PB N="56" REF="021296_0055_0FB304E9A683A268">
I performed on the 8th, in pre&s;ence of the gentlemen of the faculty afore mentioned, and took out a &s;mall portion of the jaw, about half the breadth of the &s;crew, by which it was loo&s;ened a little, &s;o as to admit of more motion than be|fore, but all our efforts to extract it proving ineffectual, and fearing that the jaw would be rendered wholly u&s;ele&s;s if the painful operation of cutting it any further &s;hould be repeated; I determined, as the dernier re&s;ort, to attempt to &s;aw off the &s;pine of the &s;crew as near to the body of it as po&s;&s;ible, hoping by that means to give it more liberty to turn within the narrow circumference to which it was confined. On the 15th, having fixed a &s;mall hand vi&s;e to the end of the &s;pine which projected out, and fixed that vice into a larger one which was fa&s;tened to a bench; I then began the difficult, painful and laborious operation, which I continued till his &s;trength and patience were exhau&s;ted. On the 16th, I rea&s;&s;umed the operation, and repeated from time to time as his &s;trengh would admit, until the 29th, when the &s;eparation was com|pleated, and the &s;pine of the &s;crew was extracted without difficulty, the body of it &s;till remaining b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hind.

<P>JULIA MEIGS, daughter to Mr. Jo&s;iah Meigs, of this city, a lovely and beautiful child, aged &s;even months, was taken about eight days ago, with a cold, attended with a cough and feveri&s;hne&s;s, e&s;pecially at night. But the &s;ympt|oms were &s;o &s;light, that her parents were not alar|med about her until Tue&s;day morning, the 23d of October, 1787, when, by the advice of a phy&s;i|cian, &s;he took a do&s;e of emetic tartar. On the evening of the &s;ame day I vi&s;ited her, at which time her pul&s;e was quick, hard and &s;trong; her re&s;piration quick, laborious, and accompanied with a rattling noi&s;e: her &s;kin was dry and &s;he was very thir&s;ty. Her countenance was pale and full, with a kind of &s;hining, leucophlegmatic ap|pearance, which extended over the whole body. The emetic which &s;he took in the morning oper|ated &s;everal times, both upward and downward, but without affording any relief. I pre&s;cribed &s;mall do&s;es of emetic tartar, as a febrifuge, with pediluvium, and diluting drinks. Wedne&s;day morning there was no abatement of the &s;ympt|oms, the pul&s;e continued quick and hard, the re|&s;piration laborious, attended with a noi&s;e not un|like the boiling of a pot, her thir&s;t was great, and her &s;kin, notwith&s;tanding the pediluvium, &amp;c. remained dry.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="021296_0057_0FB304EC76675288">It now appeared that the di&s;ea&s;e was a true pe|ripneumony, and from its rapid progre&s;s there was rea&s;on to apprehend a &s;peedy and fatal termi|nation,</P>

I then had recour&s;e to deep &s;carification and cupping, which I repeated in &s;everal places.; but with all my endeavours I could not extract more than two or three ounces of blood, which was very thick, without &s;carce any appearance of &s;erum. Nitre, can phor, &amp;c. with diluting drinks, were freely exhibited, bli&s;ters were applied to the &s;ternum &amp; &s;ides, and emollient catapla&s;ms to the lower ex|tremities. The &s;team of a warm decoction of emollient herbs was received into the lungs, and emollient nitrated enemas were frequently inject|ed. But all the&s;e remedies proved ineffectual:&mdash; &s;he made an ea&s;y exit on Friday morning.</P>

<P>The di&s;&s;ection was performed by Dr. Ne&s;bitt, in the pre&s;ence of &s;everal gentlemen of the facul|ty. Both lobes of the lungs were deeply and ex|ten&s;ively inflamed, and in &s;everal places entirely &s;phacelated.

to the di&s;ea&s;es of infants and children. Di&s;ea&s;|es of the lungs are more frequent, violent and fa|tal in infancy than in adult age. A large pro|portion of children who die under two years of age are carried off by di&s;ea&s;es in this organ; and, to the be&s;t of my recollection, many of tho&s;e which have fallen under my ob&s;ervation, have been at|tended with the &s;ame &s;ymptoms which occurred in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. But I mu&s;t candidly own, that I have not been wont to con&s;ider and treat &s;uch ca&s;es as &s;trictly inflammatory, and of cour&s;e have neglected venae&s;ection, or u&s;ed it very &s;par|ingly, and the proper antiphlogi&s;tic regimen and medicines, for emetics, pectoral detergents, &amp;c. Other practitioners, as far as I am acquainted, have pur&s;ued the &s;ame cour&s;e. But for the fut|ure, whenever I find an infant attended with a dry cough, difficulty of re&s;piration, a hard, quick pul&s;e, thir&s;t, &amp;c.

<P>I beg leave to propo&s;e it as a que&s;tion to you, my learned brethren, whether, in &s;uch a ca&s;e as the foregoing, where no vein can be found from whence a proper quantity of blood can be obtai|ned, it would not be warrantable to open an arte|ry? and whether a puncture in the temporal art|ery, which is perhaps the mo&s;t eligible, would not be admi&s;&s;ible?</P>

<HEAD>Ca&s;e of an amputation of the leg, in con&s;equence of a divided artery. By John Spalding, Surgeon. Read to the Society, <DATE><HI>2</HI>d January, <HI>1778.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<P>MR. James Robin&s;on, Jun. of Durham, aged tenty-two years, on the 27th of March, 1787, cut his leg with a &s;traight edged axe, which divided the po&s;tica arteria, near the junction of the fibula to the tibia tran&s;ver&s;ely, about one and three-fourths of an inch from where it goes off from the tibialis anticus, from which proceeded a violent hoemorrhage, which was re&s;trained for the pre&s;ent by a common bandage; it remained &s;ecure to all appearance, until April 4th, when it began to dige&s;t and the hoemorrhage returned with as great force as before, and was again &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by compre&s;s and band|age. On the 5th the hoemorhage returned a &s;e|cond time, when the Doctors Cole and Gaylord, were called in, who made a ligature round the divided artery, by which the bleeding was re|&s;trained until the 6th; in the morning the hoemorr|hage returning, I was called to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e gentlemen; we agreed to make a ligature on the upper part of the divided artery, which re|&s;trained the bleeding until the 11th; but the ligature not inve&s;ting the wounded artery, but the mu&s;cles only, immediately below it, which we di&s;|covered to be the ca&s;e after amputation, the up|per end of the artery having receded from the wound &s;o far as to be out of the reach of the needle, and the upper branch of the po&s;tica dila|ted, &s;o as to form a &s;ort of aneuri&s;m; we then, not knowing the impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;ecuring the ar|tery, agreed to fix on Pettit's tournequet, and
<PB N="61" REF="021296_0060_0FB304F335F03270">
clear the wound of the grumous blood, and cut away the mu&s;cles on each &s;ide the wound, &s;o as to admit the needle to pa&s;s &s;o deep, if po&s;&s;ible, as to encircle the artery; which operation proved un&s;ucce&s;sful as the former. We ordered the tourniquet to remain, that in ca&s;e of its bleeding it might be re&s;trained, but to be &s;o loo&s;e as not to ob&s;truct the circulation in the lea&s;t, unle&s;s upon a return of the hoemorrhage. He remained free from hoemorrhage until the 14th, when they were again alarmed by the blood flowing from the wound; they &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger after me and the gentlemen before-mentioned; we met in the evening, and from the lo&s;s of blood, which he had &s;u&s;tained at different times, and the improba|bility of &s;aying the limb by any further efforts, made known our &s;entiments to him and his friends, de&s;iring them to call in &s;uch further coun&s;el as they &s;hould think proper, which they accordingly did. We met on the 15th, and after maturely examining his ca&s;e, gave it as our opinion, that amputation was the only means of &s;aving his life; ob&s;erving, at the &s;ame time, that his recovery was doubtful, from his extreme weakne&s;s: however, as there appeared no alternative, we proceeded, and amputated the limb in the modern method, by the double inci&s;ion, &amp;c. The wound dige&s;ted Well, had very little of the &s;ymptomatic fever, ow|ing, perhaps, to the previous lo&s;s of blood. He recovered &s;ooner than u&s;ual, has a fine coat of fle&s;h, which covers the &s;tump, and he now en|joys a good &s;tate of health.</P>

<HEAD>Ca&s;e of the Bite of a Mad Dag. Communicated to the Society by Dr. Benjamin Gale. <HI>C.M.S.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE &s;aliva of a mad dog, when mixed with the refluent blood, is known to be a &s;low,

<P>The inhabitants of the&s;e northern States, have not been expo&s;ed to the bite of mad dogs, until within the compa&s;s of a few years, and for that rea&s;on I conclude phy&s;icians have not paid proper attention to &s;earch after a rational and radical cure.</P>
<P>If you judge the following hi&s;tory worthy to be communicated to the public, you have my liberty to do it, in that way, and by tho&s;e methods, you may think will render it mo&s;t u&s;eful to tho&s;e who may have the misfortune to be bit by a mad dog. The truth of the facts may be relied upon, and is well known in this vicinity.</P>
<P>A mad dog, on the 4th of October, 1786, came from the north part of this town, about &s;ix|teen miles from the &s;ea. In his cour&s;e down he pa&s;&s;ed through the ea&s;t part of the town of Guil|ford, and again entered and pa&s;&s;ed through this town on the po&s;t-road, as far as the we&s;t pari&s;h of Saybrook, where he was pur&s;ued, overtaken, and killed. He attacked and bit a child in Ea&s;t-Guil|ford, in the vertebrae of the neck, the wound much lacerated. In this town he bit a girl about eight or ten years of age, through her cloaths in her hip, one tooh perforated the &s;kin and drew blood. In his whole cour&s;e, in the whole of cattle, hogs, dogs, including the children, he wounded the &s;ame day, to the number of fifteen or &s;ixteen; all the dogs bitten, were killed &s;oon after being bit, except one, which was permitted to run at large until it manife&s;tly &s;hewed &s;ymptoms of mad|ne&s;s, and then was killed: all the other animals bitten run mad and died, except one &s;ow,
<PB N="63" REF="021296_0062_0FB304F64D028160">
which &s;uckled a number of pigs, &s;ix or eight weeks old; &s;he was bit in the tip of one ear, which was perforated by one tooh only&mdash;The &s;ow nor her litter of pigs were in any perceptible man|ner affected; which, I conceive, was owing to the poi&s;on pa&s;&s;ing into the blood, being immediately drawn off by the lacteals, and di&s;&s;eminated among the whole litter of her pigs, before it had conta|minated the ma&s;s of blood, it might not affect either &s;ow or pigs; as it is well known the mo&s;tde|leterious poi&s;on may be taken in &s;o &s;mall a do&s;e, as not to injure the animal machine.</P>
<P>I had certain advice the &s;ame day the child was bit at Ea&s;t-Guilford, by one who both &s;aw the dog and the child, &s;oon after it was bit; and again &s;aw the dog as he was pa&s;&s;ing through this town, and informed me it was mad, which was the occa&s;ion of its being pur&s;ued and killed.&mdash; Never expecting to have &s;uch a ca&s;e, I had &s;pent but little thoughts on the &s;ubject; but had taken &s;o much notice of of practical writers on the &s;ub|ject, in the cour&s;e of my reading, as to think their pre&s;criptions trifling and in&s;ignificant. Be|ing anxious for the &s;afety of the children bitten, recollecting I had an abridgement of all the me|dical ca&s;es that had been read before the royal &s;ociety, and finding one among others, which I looked upon rational, and which had been &s;uc|ce&s;sful &s;o late as the year 1731, which was put in practice by Mr. Floyer, in con&s;equence of the recommendation of Dr. James, who never had made trial of the medicine him&s;elf, which was turpeth. min. &s;everal times repeated. The trial was made fir&s;t on dogs that were mad; giving for the fir&s;t do&s;e twelve, the &s;econd twenty-four, the third forty-eight grains, and the method &s;uc|ceeded:
<PB N="64" REF="021296_0063_0FB304F81F34A1D8">
it was afterwards tried on three of the human kind, and was &s;ucce&s;sful in all three.&mdash; Concluding the child bitten would fall under the care of Dr. Todd, a young gentleman who had &s;tudied under my care, I immediately wrote him my advice, as follows, founded on that intima|tion given in the philo&s;ophical tran&s;actions, No. 441, page 241. (which &s;ee) I advi&s;ed him to dre&s;s the wound with equal parts of &s;. nit. and &s;. marin, finely pulverized, to &s;carrify the wound as much as the part would admit, if nece&s;&s;ary, and to fill the wound with it, and likewi&s;e to in|corporate with it the dige&s;tive.</P>
<P>Common &s;alt I had experienced of great effica|cy in wounds from the bite of dogs not mad, and the addition of &s;. nit. I took as a hint from the worthy pre&s;ident of your &s;ociety, and then imme|diately to give an emet. of turpeth miner. prop|ortioned to the age of the child, &s;o as to puke it three or four times. And to repeat it for four or five times, at the di&s;tance of four, five or &s;ix days, taking in the intermediate days a portion of calo|mel in theriac. audrom. &s;ufficient to purge it two or three times the next day. The calomel to be taken at night going to bed, and a draught of canker weed, boiled in milk and water, every night. By canker weed, I mean an herb brought into our a&s;&s;embly by a member &s;ome years pa&s;t, famous for its u&s;efulne&s;s in the malignant &s;pecies of the apthae, accompanied with a putrid fever, in order to &s;pread its utility thro' the government. Mr. B. Batram, the famous botani&s;t, of Philad|elphia, once &s;hewed me the &s;ame plant, and told me it was &s;overeign in the bite of the rattle&s;nake, and termed it <HI>prenanthes,</HI> a name however I never could find in any botanic writer. By this method,
<PB N="65" REF="021296_0064_0FB304FB0C0CF9E8">
carefully attended, the child got well, and rem|ains &s;o to the pre&s;ent time.</P>
<P>The girl bitten the &s;ame day in this town, I vi|&s;ited the next day from principles of philanthropy, concluding they had &s;ent for a phy&s;ician who at pre&s;ent re&s;ides among us. I a&s;ked the mother of the child whether her daughter had been bitten by the mad dog the preceding day? who told me with a &s;miling countenance &s;he had, and &s;eemed wholly unconcerned. I then a&s;ked her whether &s;he had con&s;ulted a phy&s;ician? &s;he told me &s;he had not. I then endeavoured to convince her of the great danger her child was in; but it made no impre&s;&s;ion on her. I a&s;ked leave to &s;ee the wound, which was on her hip. I carefully examined the wound, and found one tooth had perforated the &s;kin and drew blood. A little below where the tooth had perforated the &s;kin there appeared a &s;treak, which looked like blood &s;ettled under the &s;kin from being brui&s;ed, but rather of a darker hue. As the woman was &s;o unconcern'd, I did not think proper to urge a &s;carification, but advi|&s;ed her to make a poultice of wheat bread and milk, and incorporate as much of the &s;. marin. as could well be mixed after it was reduced to the con&s;i&s;tence of a poultice, and to wear it &s;teadily. The contu&s;ed part appeared to be about one third of an inch in length, and the width of the narrow|e&s;t tape. I told her if &s;he would permit me to give her child medicines, I would do it <HI>gratis,</HI> which &s;he at la&s;t con&s;ented to. I put her upon the &s;ame cour&s;e of medicine I had advi&s;ed in the ca&s;e of the other child. The poultice &s;eparated a large &s;lough from the wound, but not deeper than the cutis, about an inch long and half an inch wide, and afterwards &s;oon healed. I &s;hould have

thught the tooth pa&s;&s;ing thro all the cloaths the child had on, it might have wiped off all the &s;ali|va, in which I conceive the poi&s;on is contained, had it not ca&s;t off &s;o large a &s;lough. The child continuing the cour&s;e of medicine pre&s;cribed, had no &s;ymptoms of the rabies.</P>

<P>JOSIAH TUTTLE, of Ea&s;t-Haven, aged twenty-one years, of a large frame and rigid fibres, was &s;eized on his pa&s;&s;age from New-York, on Saturday, the 9th of June, with the eruptive variolous fever; the &s;ymptoms ran very high, but at that time, he &s;uppo&s;ed he had only caught cold by &s;leeping on the deck, and did not &s;u&s;pect he had received the infection. On his arrival that evening, or the next morning, Dr. Hotchki&s;s was con&s;ulted, who bled him, and pre&s;cribed fe|brifuges. On the 10th, about ten at night, I &s;aw the patient for the fir&s;t time, found him very re&s;tle&s;s, with great delirium, a &s;trong throbbing pul&s;e, &s;kin hot and dry, his countenance very florid, his eyes inflamed, and a great determina|tion to the head, with a con&s;tant nau&s;ea and eruc|tation of bilious phlegm. I immediately let blood to the amount of twenty ounces, then gave him a &s;trong &s;olution of emetic tartar. During its ope|ration he ejected great quantities of bile: after the operation of the emetic, I gave him a cooling purge, which had its de&s;ired effect, thoroughly clean&s;ing the inte&s;tinal canal, the vomit having

failed in that part of the operation. I remained with the patient until about four o'clock in the morning, and had an opportunity of remarking that he obtained relief from all and every part of the treatment; the delirium almo&s;t gone, the re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, &amp;c. &s;o that he could lie compo&s;ed, which, before the&s;e evacuations, required the fa|mily to detain him in bed. I enquired on my fir&s;t &s;eeing him, whether he had not been expo&s;ed to the &s;mall-pox, as at that time no &s;atisfactory information could be received from him; I &s;trong|ly &s;u&s;pected the &s;mall pox, and was determined in this in&s;tance, to try the effects of the antiphlo|gi&s;tic regimen: he was allowed only a &s;heet to co|ver him when in bed, the doors and windows of the room open con&s;tantly, and in the day enjoined to be led out; his drinks were beverage impreg|nated with nitre, &amp;c.</P>
<P>On the afternoon of the 11th, I vi&s;ited him, the eruption was then evident, he was much better, but &s;till too much fever for his &s;afety, and had now and then intervals of wildne&s;s and delirium: I let blood again, to the amount of about &s;ixteen ounces, gave him frequent do&s;es of the nitre, his drinks and regimen continued.</P>
<P>On the 13th, I was called to vi&s;it him, chiefly to determine whether the eruption was the &s;mall-pox; their doubts aro&s;e from his being &s;o well, and &s;o free from any complaint, and the eruption &s;o di&s;tinct and favourable, that the family and others &s;aid it was impo&s;&s;ible to be the &s;mall-pox, and therefore pronounced it was the chicken pox. On in&s;pection I was convinced otherwi&s;e; I con|tinued to affirm it was the &s;mall-pox, that he was pa&s;t all danger, and felt very happy to &s;ee the good effect of a bold antiphlogi&s;tic cour&s;e. Dr. Hubbard agreed to inoculate the family who had
<PB N="68" REF="021296_0067_0FB30502F1C69D60">
been expo&s;ed, I therefore, as a matter of conve|nience, and a &s;aving to the family, re&s;igned my patient to the care of the Doctor, perfectly &s;atis|fied with the i&s;&s;ue of my experiment: the Doctor carried him through with ea&s;e and &s;afety, he ma|king no complaint, except from a few pu&s;tules on the &s;oles of his feet.</P>
<P>This ca&s;e, Gentlemen, and many other ob&s;er|vations I have had opportunity to make in the di&s;ea&s;e, leads me to draw this conclusion, that the good or bad management of the eruptive fever, in mo&s;t habits, &s;tamps the extent and fu|ture progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e, perhaps I may ven|ture to &s;ay, the very nature of the pock; and that in this &s;tage chiefly, if not principally, is the &s;kill of a phy&s;ician manife&s;ted and called for.</P>

<HEAD>Hi&s;tory of a Dy&s;entery, in the <HI>22</HI>d regiment of the late Continental Army, occa&s;ioned by the Bar|racks' being over crowded, and not properly ventilated. Communicated by Doctor Ebenezer Beard&s;ley. Read <DATE>Jan. <HI>2, 1788.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<P>ABOUT the fir&s;t of April, 1776, the Am|erican army under the command of his Excellency Gen. Wa&s;hington, marched from Bo|&s;ton to New-York, at which place they arrived about the middle of the month. The &s;ick and invalids having been left behind in the ho&s;pitals, the whole army was in perfect health.</P>
<P>The troops were quartered in barracks, and in the hou&s;es of the citizens, till about the 10th of May, when they went into tents, except the 22d regiment, under the command of Col. Samuel Wyllys, who for want of tents, continued in their quarters in Smith Street.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="021296_0068_0FB305041EF51C20">The regiment were very healthy till about the middle of the month, when more than one hund|red men were taken down with the dy&s;entery in the &s;pace of one week. Such a &s;udden inva&s;ion of this formidable di&s;ea&s;e alarmed me very much, and I was greatly &s;urpri&s;ed, upon enquiry to find, that there was not a &s;ingle dy&s;enteric patient in the whole army, except tho&s;e which belonged to our regiment. From this circum&s;tance I concluded, that the di&s;ea&s;e was occa&s;ioned by &s;ome cau&s;e pe|culiar to the city; but after a particular enquiry, I could not find that there was a &s;ingle inhabitant &s;ick with this di&s;ea&s;e in the city: tho&s;e who lived in the &s;ame &s;treet with us, and many of them in the &s;ame hou&s;es, were free from that or any other acute di&s;ea&s;e. For &s;everal days I was much perplexed and entirely at a lo&s;s to determine what had given ri&s;e to the di&s;ea&s;e. At length I ob&s;erved, that not only the inhabitants who lived with us were free from the di&s;temper, but &s;everal whole companies of the &s;ame regiment had nothing of it. This led me to con&s;ider more minutely the circum&s;tances and &s;ituation of the &s;ick, the whole of which were quartered either in low, underground rooms, or in chambers or garrets, which were &s;o &s;ituated at not to admit a free circulation of air. The rooms were al&s;o con&s;iderably le&s;s than u&s;ual in proportion to the number of men. Having made the&s;e di&s;|coveries and ob&s;ervations, I concluded at once that the di&s;ea&s;e originated from the confined and putrid atmo&s;phere, which the&s;e unfortunate men lived in. I immediately communicated my ob|&s;ervations to the Colonel, and reque&s;ted that the men, both &s;ick and well, might be removed out of tho&s;e rooms into &s;uch as were more airy and capacious. This mea&s;ure was attended with the
<PB N="70" REF="021296_0069_0FB305083707C0D8">
mo&s;t &s;alutary con&s;equences: Tho&s;e who &s;ick recovered in a &s;hort time, except two, who died; and no more being &s;eized with the di&s;temp|er, in a few weeks the regiment became quite heal|thy. This &s;triking in&s;tance of the pernicious eff|ects of putrid, &s;tagnant air, was of great &s;ervice to me in the cour&s;e of the campaign. In the months of July, Augu&s;t and September, the dy&s;|entery, bilious and other fevers of the putrid kind, became very rife in the army. I took great pains to procure for our men who were down with tho&s;e di&s;orders, large rooms; and to have them well ventilated, and clean&s;ed once or twice a week. Yet under the&s;e circum&s;tances I frequently found, caeteris paribus, that the &s;ick who lay in and near the corners of the rooms, were handled much more &s;everely than tho&s;e who lay in and near the middle of them. I do not remember to have met with this ob&s;ervation before, but I think it is of no &s;mall importance in the treatment of dy&s;enter|ies, and other putrid fevers.</P>
<P>From the foregoing hi&s;tory the following prac|tical deductions may be made. Fir&s;t, that caeter|is paribus, people who live in airy, capacious hou|&s;es, are le&s;s liable to be &s;eized with dy&s;enteries and other putrid fevers, than tho&s;e who live in &s;maller hou&s;es and breathe a more confined air. Secondly, that patients labouring under the&s;e di&s;|ea&s;es in&s;tead of being confined in &s;mall, tight rooms, (the common and fatal practice of the country in general) ought either not to be confi|ned to the hou&s;e at all, or to be placed in the mo&s;t &s;pacious and airy rooms. Thirdly, that it is highly probable that &s;mothering feather beds, warm, clo&s;e rooms, and over careful nur&s;ing, are among the principal cau&s;es of the fatality which
<PB N="71" REF="021296_0070_0FB3050A8220B938">
too often attends this cla&s;s of di&s;ea&s;es. Fourthly, that per&s;ons in the latter &s;tages of a pulmonary con&s;umption, when they u&s;ually &s;pit large quanti|ties of purulent matter, and their per&s;piration and other excreta are of a putrid di&s;po&s;ition, ought to be treated in this re&s;pect, as tho' they were &s;ick with a dy&s;entery or other putrid fever; which will not only conduce to their pre&s;ervation and com|fort, but is the only means of &s;afety to their at|tendants and friends.</P>

<HEAD>Ca&s;e of a divi&s;ion of the Tendo Achillis. By Dr. Samuel Ne&s;bitt. Read to the Society, <DATE>January <HI>2</HI>d, <HI>1788.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<P>WILLIAM HOTCHKISS, aged ten years, &s;on of Captain Stephen Hotchki&s;s, of this city, on the 3d of October, 1783, was wounded a little above the heel of his left leg, by the &s;troke of a drawing knife. I happened to be pre&s;ent at the time of the accident, and on examining the wound, found a compleat divi&s;ion of the tendon of the ga&s;trocnemei mu&s;cle, commonly called the tendon of Achilles, about three quarters of an inch above its in&s;ertion into the os calcis; having no convenient dre&s;&s;ing on the &s;pot, I dre&s;&s;ed it &s;uperficially, &s;o as to pre&s;erve it from the action of the air; the accident happening abroad, he was carefully conveyed home, with his leg and foot placed in the mo&s;t favourable po&s;ture to pre|vent the receding of the tendon.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of a call, I vi&s;ited the patient, and in the pre&s;ence of Dr. Eneas Mun&s;on, exam|ined the wound. A compleat divi&s;ion of the tendon was clearly a&s;certained, and that part of the tendon adjoining the mu&s;cle was found rece|ded
<PB N="72" REF="021296_0071_0FB3050BA1A47510">
about an inch and a half from the lower part, and hid under the common integuments of the parts. We concluded to bring the divided ends of the tendon into contact, by &s;uture; and in order thereto, found it nece&s;&s;ary to make a longitudinal inci&s;ion, about two inches, thro' the integuments previous to a &s;uture of the tendon, thereby expo&s;ing the receded point of the tendon about half an inch; I then pa&s;&s;ed an armed nee|dle through each extremity of the tendon, about half an inch from the divided extreme, pre|viou&s;ly placing the limb in a &s;tate of flexion, with the heel &s;trongly bent back, and, by means of &s;traps, &amp;c. continually through the cure, retain|ed in that po&s;ition. The wound was then dre&s;&s;ed up with &s;mall pledgets of dry lint, and a pledget of the linim. arcoei. over the whole. Re&s;t was enjoined the patient, a &s;trict antiphlogi&s;tic regim|en pre&s;cribed, and an anodyne for the night. On the 4th we vi&s;ited our patient: found him much ea&s;ier than we expected: ordered an emollient cat|apla&s;m over the dre&s;&s;ings: an enema to be admi|ni&s;tered, and an anodyne for the night.</P>
<P>On the 5th we vi&s;ited our patient: the ten&s;i|on and inflammation moderate: he had re&s;ted well: therefore found no occa&s;ion to alter the ab|ove method; but directed as before.</P>
<P>On the 6th we removed the dre&s;&s;ings, the wound beginning to dige&s;t, and the divided part remaining in compleat contact, gave a favorable a&s;pect to the ca&s;e: dre&s;&s;ed with warm pledgets of liniment&punc; arcoei. pur&s;ued the antiphlogi&s;tic treat|ment, re&s;t, and anodyne, h. &s;. with the &s;tricte&s;t attention to the flexure of the limb and foot. On the 7th we continued the &s;ame treatment; fever and other &s;ymptoms moderate, the a&s;pect of the

wound favourable; repeat an enema, and the an|odyne, h. &s;.</P>
<P>On the 8th dre&s;&s;ed the wound as u&s;ual, ten&s;ion and inflammation of the parts moderate, a lauda|ble di&s;charge of pus, and the future beginning to loo&s;en, &s;o as to call our attention more particul|arly to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of bandages and the &s;trap, le&s;t the parts, by inattention or a &s;udden motion, might be torn a&s;under. Continued the regimen and the anodyne h. &s;.</P>
<P>On the 9th the di&s;charge and appearance of the wound continued favourable, the thread was re|moved, and the parts remaining yet in complete contact, a &s;mall &s;lough beginning to ca&s;t off from that part of the tendon that was compre&s;&s;'d by the thread. Treatment as u&s;ual, only with the omi&s;|&s;ion of the anodyne, and the addition of an oily embrocation to the knee, ancle, &amp;c.</P>
<P>On the 10th the &s;loughs ca&s;t off, a fine appea|rance of a granulation, or increa&s;e of that part of the tendon ca&s;t off, and the &s;ymptoms in every re&s;pect mild and favourable.</P>
<P>The 11th granulations increa&s;e, and appear to extend them&s;elves along the whole &s;urface of the denuded tendon, the parts in complete contact, with a laudable di&s;charge from the wound.</P>
<P>The 12th, granulations increa&s;ing a little too fa&s;t, praecip. merc. r. was added to the former dre&s;&s;ings,</P>
<P>The 13th, and for &s;ome days, the fungus rath|er luxuriant rendered the continuance of the pre|cipitate nece&s;&s;ary; however, the granulations, gradually &s;ubdued and re&s;trained, changed their appearance and texture, from a &s;oft fungus, to that of a tendon; &s;o that at the end of the month a complete cure took place, without any accid|ent

or bad &s;ymptom, except a trifling one of a fall, which the patient had in attempting to walk after the wound was completely cicatrized, by which, on examination, there appeared to be a laceration, or &s;eparation of the integuments in contact with the exterior &s;urface of the tendon, and a &s;mall dif|fu&s;ion of blood marking the extent of the tran&s;|ver&s;e and longitudinal inci&s;ion. As &s;oon as the patient was fit to go abroad, a &s;hoe was contrived with a high heel, and the limb guarded by a &s;trap, to prevent a &s;udden exten&s;ion of the limb or mu&s;|cle, and this regulation complied with for &s;ome months, gradually lowering the heel to the &s;tand|ard of the other foot, &s;o that by degrees, a free and perfect u&s;e of the limb was re&s;tored, and at the pre&s;ent no difficulty remains, but is as active as any lad of his age and con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The apparatus made u&s;e of to re&s;train the limb in a &s;tate of flexure, and its mu&s;cles from any un|favourable action, were a &s;trong piece of pa&s;te|board, accommodated to the upper part of the foot or in&s;tep and ancle, and confined by band|age, which by its pre&s;&s;ure again&s;t the anterior and inferior part of the leg, prevented the elevation of the foot; the leg was pre&s;erved in a &s;tate of flexure, and the ga&s;trocnemei mu&s;cle in a &s;tate of con&s;tant relaxation, by a &s;trap affixed to the heel of a &s;lipper, that went over all the bandages on the foot, and led to a bandage above the knee, with a buckle to lengthen or &s;horten it at plea|&s;ure. The few in&s;tances that occur, or are re|corded of &s;imilar ca&s;es, induced me to lay this before you, Gentlemen, more e&s;pecially, as there have been many objections offered again&s;t &s;utures in the ca&s;e of &s;uch wounds,: it is true, the patient referred to in this ca&s;e, was young and of a &s;pare,

delicate habit, and of cour&s;e le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to inflam|mation, and a numerous train of bad &s;ymptoms, common to &s;uch wounds in the plethoric and adult habit, yet, in my opinion, it does not argue again&s;t the &s;afety of the practice, provided the an|tiphlogi&s;tic method is carried to the extent &s;uch plethoric habits require, as the degree of &s;ymtom|atic fever alone, in &s;uch, and perhaps all wounds, (not in them&s;elves mortal) mu&s;t determine the proportion of danger or difficulty.</P>

<P>ON January the 22d, 1781, I was called to vi&s;it Mrs. Potter, aged 58 years, who had been afflicted with a large &s;crophulous tumour on the &s;ore part of her neck, and much &s;ubject to melancholly, and under temptations to put a period to her life, for a number of years. On the 22d day of January, &s;he, with a pair of &s;hears (which &s;he had &s;ecreted for that purpo&s;e) attempted her own life, by thru&s;ting one blade of them into her throat; cutting the trachea ab|out two thirds off; and wounding the oe&s;ophagus. I arrived about half an hour after, and found a deep and frightful wound in her throat; the fore part of the trachea open, and extended about an inch. Dr. Ives being in the neighbourhood, was called in to a&s;&s;i&s;t me. I made two ligatures on the trachea, one on the right and the other on the left &s;ide of it; directed her to &s;wallow no|thing but liquids, until I &s;aw her again; and to
<PB N="76" REF="021296_0075_0FB30517666256F8">
keep her head in a prone &s;ituation. On the 23d, found &s;he had &s;lept very little, her pul&s;e calm, the wound di&s;charging a gleety matter copiou&s;ly: dre&s;&s;ed it with lint dipped in bal&s;. traumaticum; directed her to take 20 drops of the bal&s;am, in a tea of baum. On the 24th found her pul&s;e a little accelerated, and her re&s;t di&s;turbed in con&s;equence of a cough: pre&s;cribed a tea of flax&s;eed and hon|ey, with a do&s;e of the elixir a&s;th. to be taken at night, and chicken broth &s;paringly, on account of the difficulty of deglutition, which never fail|ed to excite the cough. The wound di&s;charged a vi&s;cid gleet; ordered a &s;aline draught, and a cooling enema: her cough abated, and &s;he re&s;ted better. On the 25th found a full pul&s;e, a dy&s;p|nea, with an inflammation on the &s;crophulous tumour threatening a gangrene. I let blood, &amp; gave her a &s;olution of &s;al nit. ordered her feet to be bathed in warm water, and to take her broth &s;paringly, part of which e&s;caped through the wound.</P>
<P>On the 26th, I found her pul&s;e very full, with great difficulty in re&s;piration, and the &s;crophulous tumour much inflamed; ordered her feet to be bathed in warm water, and took from her about twelve ounces of blood, which gave her immedi|ate relief: continued the nitrous &s;olution, and &s;he re&s;ted much better that night than the preced|ing; the wound continuing to di&s;charge a gleet with a little purulent matter. On the 27th, per|ceived an ab&s;ce&s;s had formed in the body of the tumour, which had emptied its contents into the wound, part of which was di&s;charged by the mouth; the inflamation abated, the gleet le&s;s, a di&s;charge of pus, and the fever abating. On the 28th, I found, by a fit of coughing the night
<PB N="77" REF="021296_0076_0FB30519B6C38800">
before, the ligatures had given way, her breath and liquids which &s;he took came out at the wound; I then pa&s;&s;ed an armed needle through the divi|ded mu&s;cles and trachea, making three &s;utures on the gaping wound, drawing the edges into clo&s;e contact; then dilated the &s;crophulous tu|mour, at its depending &s;inus, in order to give vent to the matter, advi&s;ing her not to take any thing into her mouth for &s;everal hours; &s;he re&s;ted better than &s;he had done at any time before. On the 29th, found the inflammation much abated, owing to the free di&s;charge at the depending ori|fice; her re&s;piration relieved, yet on her taking drink &s;ome of it e&s;caped through the wound; the matter di&s;charged was of a better kind. I directed her head to be kept &s;till and in a prone &s;ituation. On the 30th, found &s;he had re&s;ted very well, her mind a little more compo&s;ed, the tumour le&s;&s;ening daily, &s;he could &s;wallow much better, e&s;pecially when &s;he took but a little at a time; her fever &s;ub&s;iding, and the appearance of the wound favourable. On the 31&s;t, &s;he had a cra|ving appetite for food that was more nouri&s;hing; gave her an egg beat up with wine and &s;ugar; &s;he &s;wallowed it without much difficulty; and ap|peared mending in every re&s;pect. Feb. 1&s;t, found her craving &s;olid food; I informed her it was not admi&s;&s;ible under her pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, and mu&s;t content her&s;elf with her liquid diet, until the wound cicatrized. On the 2d, found &s;he had re&s;ted very well, &s;wallowed with ea&s;e, very little of it e&s;caping at the wound. From this time &s;he mended daily, and the wound incarned and cica|trized, and &s;he now enjoys her u&s;ual health.</P>

<HEAD>Ca&s;e of an enlarged Gall Bladder. By Ebenezer Beard&s;ley. Read <DATE>April <HI>2</HI>d <HI>1788.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<P>MRS. Scott, a healthy temperate indu&s;trious woman aged 44, was &s;eized with a vio|lent paroxy&s;m of the bilious colic, attended with the u&s;ual &s;ymptoms of nau&s;ea, vomiting, &s;evere pain in the abdomen and co&s;tivene&s;s. She obtained relief from purges and other remedies commonly u&s;ed in that di&s;order; and in about a week was quite free from pain and di&s;ea&s;e, ex|cept a &s;light jaundice, which di&s;appeared within a few weeks, in the u&s;e of &s;aponaceous and other medicines. She continued healthy for about three months, when &s;he was again attacked with a more &s;evere fit of the cholic, which la&s;ted lon|ger and was more difficult to cure than the former: this paroxy&s;m, like the fir&s;t, was &s;ucceeded by a jaundice, which was more ob&s;tinate than before; but at the end of &s;ix or eight weeks it di&s;ap|peared, and left her to appearance in a &s;tate of health. She continued apparently healthy for about four months, when &s;he was attacked with a third paroxy&s;m of cholic, which was much more &s;evere than either of the former. Aloetic purges, fomentations, enemas, &amp;c. removed the con&s;ti|pation of the bowels and pain in about a week. But from this period &s;he began to complain of an ince&s;&s;ant cardialgia, which preyed upon her without intermi&s;&s;ion: an obtu&s;e, deep &s;eated pain in the pit of her &s;tomach and right hydochondrium, a yellowne&s;s in her eyes and &s;kin, ob&s;tinate co&s;tivene&s;s, with other &s;ymptoms of an inveterate jaundice. For the&s;e complaints &s;he took mercurials, &s;oap, lime-water, gum pills, ab&s;orbents, bitters, &amp;c. But notwith&s;tanding
<PB N="79" REF="021296_0078_0FB3051D77557F30">
her complaints daily increa&s;ed, her appetite for|&s;ook her, the heat and unea&s;ine&s;s about her &s;tomach became intolerable, and in about four months &s;he died, quite emaciated. Soon after her death I examined the body in pre&s;ence of my brother and another phy&s;ician. Upon making a tran&s;ver&s;e inci&s;ion through the integuments, a lit|tle below the diphragm, we were &s;urpri&s;ed at the &s;udden and violent protru&s;ion of a hard ela&s;tic body through the aperture we had made, which upon farther examination we found to be the gall bladder, di&s;tended to the enormous length of ten inches, and proportionably large in its diameter.</P>
<P>The coats of the bladder, notwith&s;tanding the amazing di&s;ten&s;ion, were thick, hard, and ela&s;tic, we &s;eparated it from the liver, and opened it by a longitudinal inci&s;ion from the neck to the fundus, and found that the di&s;ten&s;ion and enlargement, were occa&s;ioned by a preternatural fle&s;hy &s;ub&s;tance, which appeared to have &s;prouted out from all that part of the bladder which is connected with the liver, and had gradually increa&s;ed to &s;uch a mon|&s;trous &s;ize. The fungus, or fle&s;hy &s;ub&s;tance, con&s;i&s;ted of coar&s;e parallel fibres, not unlike the mu&s;cular parts of lean beef, and from the middle of it we extracted near an ounce of a &s;oft, grey coloured calculus. The end of the fungous &s;ub|&s;tance, next to the fundus of the bladder, was in a &s;tate of &s;uppuration, and there was a &s;poonful of very thick cream coloured pus about it. It did not adhere to the bladder any where but at its in&s;ertion into the liver. There was no appearance of bile in the gall-bladder, the communication with the liver being wholly cut off by the fungous body.</P>

<HEAD>Ca&s;e of Dy&s;enteric Symptoms from worms. By Dr. Samuel Ne&s;bitt. Read before the Society <DATE>April <HI>2, 1788.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<P>IN the winter of 1784, I was called to vi&s;it a child of the Rev. Bela Hubbard, Aged two years. The child was &s;eized on the night pre|ceeding with a violent fever, great re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, a con&s;tant nau&s;ea, and vomiting, attended with alarming dy&s;enteric &s;ymptoms, viz. a frequent di&s;charge of an acrid mucus, re&s;embling in col|our beef brine, a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing tene&s;mus, with a tum|efaction and ten&s;ion of the abdomen. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances I found my little patient on the morning &s;ucceeding the attack. The dy&s;en|enteric &s;ymptoms were &s;o &s;trongly marked, that, overlooking the circum&s;tance of worms, I bent my whole attention to deterge the acrid offend|ing matter; and accordingly pre&s;cribed two gr. of emetic tartar, to be di&s;&s;olved in four table &s;poonfulls of warm water, and one &s;poonfull to be given every half hour, until the child had taken the whole, or a &s;ufficiency to clear well the &s;tom|ach. The fir&s;t &s;poonfull &s;uppre&s;&s;ed every appea|rance of &s;ickne&s;s at the &s;tomach, the &s;econd was
<PB N="81" REF="021296_0080_0FB30521625A7EA0">
given, and the whole according to the directions above, without any apparent di&s;po&s;ition to vom|it. Its operation was cathartic, and procured, within three hours from the fir&s;t do&s;e of the tart|ar, a di&s;charge of thirty two large worm of the round kind. Some of them mea&s;ured 8 and 9 inches in length, none, that I remember, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hort of four inches. The fir&s;t di&s;charge contain|ed twenty, which were forced into the anus in &s;uch a body, that the a&s;&s;i&s;tants found it nece&s;&s;ary to relieve the child by the hand. Two di&s;charges more compleated the number, they were all alive and &s;quirming on the receiver. From the expul|&s;ion of &s;uch a number of di&s;agreeable tenants, every dy&s;enteric &s;ymptom vani&s;hed, the ten&s;ion of the abdomen and fever &s;ub&s;ided, and from that period a perfect recovery took place, without any further a&s;&s;i&s;tance from medicine.</P>
<P>Thus, gentlemen, without a&s;&s;uming any credit to my&s;elf, a happy and &s;peedy i&s;&s;ue was, by acci|dent, obtained in the pre&s;ent alarming ca&s;e, and by a medicine, which, in its operation, proved the mo&s;t active and powerful anthelmintic I had, or ever have met with in my practice; curing, as Cel&s;us &s;ays,
<Q>Tuto, cito &amp; jucundo.</Q></P>
<P>I mo&s;t &s;incerely wi&s;h we could always be &s;o for|tunate in our pre&s;criptions, when we are right in our conjectures of the proximate cau&s;e of di&s;ea&s;es. But it is not to be expected that a mi&s;taken theo|ry will always terminate &s;o favourably.</P>

<HEAD>Ca&s;e of a &s;chirrhus in the Pylorus of an infant. Communicated by Doctor Hezekiah Beard&s;ley. Read <DATE>April <HI>2, 1788</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<P>A CHILD of Mr. Joel Grannis, a re&s;pect|able farmer in the town of Southington, in the fir&s;t week of its infancy, was attacked with a
<PB N="82" REF="021296_0081_0FB30523509112D8">
puking, or ejection of the milk, and of every other &s;ub&s;tance it received into its &s;tomach almo&s;t in|&s;tantaneou&s;ly, and very little changed. The foeces were in &s;mall quantity and of an a&s;h colour, which continued with little variation till its death. For the&s;e complaints a phy&s;ician was con&s;ulted, who treated it as a common ca&s;e ari&s;ing from aci|dity in the prima via; the te&s;taceous powders and other ab&s;orbents and correctors of acid acri|mony, were u&s;ed for a long time without any ap|parent benefit. The child, notwith&s;tanding it continued to eject whatever was received into the &s;tomach, yet &s;eemed otherwi&s;e pretty well, and increa&s;ed in &s;tature nearly in the &s;ame proportion as is common to that &s;tate of infancy, but more lean, with a pale countenance and a loo&s;e and wrinkled &s;kin like that of old people. This, as nearly as I can recollect at this di&s;tance of time, was his appearance and &s;ituation when I was fir&s;t called to attend him; he was now about two years old. I was at fir&s;t inclined to attribute the di&s;|order to a deficiency of the bile and ga&s;tric juices, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to dige&s;tion and chylification, joined with a morbid relaxation of the &s;tomach, the ac|tion of which &s;eemed wholly owing to the weight and pre&s;&s;ure of its contents, as aliment taken in &s;mall quantities would often remain on it, till by the addition of fre&s;h quantities, the whole, or nearly all was ejected; but his thir&s;t, or &s;ome other cau&s;e, mo&s;t commonly occa&s;ioned his &s;wal|lowing &s;uch large draughts as to cau&s;e an imme|diate ejection, and oftentimes before the cup was taken from his mouth. It did not appear that he was attended with nau&s;ea or &s;ickne&s;s at his &s;to|mach, but he often complained that he was choak|ed, and of his own accord would introduce his finger or the probang, &s;o as to excite the hea|ving
<PB N="83" REF="021296_0082_0FB30525E12CD028">
of the &s;tomach and an ejection of its contents; the u&s;e of this in&s;trument was generally nece&s;&s;ary if the &s;tomach did not of it&s;elf, in a few moments, di&s;charge its contents, the choaking would in that &s;hort &s;pace of time become almo&s;t intolerable, which by this di&s;charge was entirely removed. In this &s;ituation, with very little variation of &s;ymp|toms he continued till death clo&s;ed the painful and melancholy &s;cene, when he was about five years of age. He was uncommonly chearful and active con&s;idering his &s;ituation. A number of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable medical characters were con|&s;ulted and a variety of medicines were u&s;ed to little or no effect. His death, though long expected, was &s;udden, which I did not learn till the &s;econd day after it took place. This late period, the almo&s;t intolerable &s;tench, and the impatience of the people who had collected for the funeral pre|vented &s;o thorough an examination of the body, as might otherwi&s;e have been made. On open|ing the thorax, the oe&s;ophagus was found greatly di&s;tended beyond its u&s;ual dimen&s;ions in &s;uch young &s;ubjects; from one end to the other of this tube, between the circular fibres which compo&s;e the middle coat, were &s;mall ve&s;icles, &s;ome of which contained a table &s;poonful of a thin fluid like water, and &s;eemed capable of holding much more. I next examined the &s;tomach, which was unu&s;ually large, the coats were about the thickne&s;s of a hog's bladder when fre&s;h and di&s;tended with air, it contained about a wine pint of a fluid exactly re&s;embling that found in the ve&s;icles before-men|tioned, and which I &s;uppo&s;e to have been received ju&s;t before his death. The pylorus was inve&s;ted with a hard compact &s;ub&s;tance, or &s;chirro&s;ity, which &s;o completely ob&s;tructed the pa&s;&s;age into
<PB N="84" REF="021296_0083_0FB305296A01E418">
the duodenum, as to admit with the greate&s;t dif|ficulty the fine&s;t fluid; whether this was the ori|ginal di&s;order, or only a con&s;equence, may per|haps be a que&s;tion. In ju&s;tice to my&s;elf I ought to mention, that I had pronounced a &s;chirro&s;ity in that part for months before the child<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s death. On removing the integuments of the abdomen, I was &s;truck with the appearance of the ve&s;ica fellis, which was nearly five inches in length and more than one in diameter, it lay tran&s;ver&s;ly acro&s;s the abdomen, and was bedded into the &s;mall inte&s;|tines, which were &s;phacelated wherever they came in contact with it; its contents were rather &s;olid than fluid, and re&s;embled fle&s;h in a highly putrid &s;tate; its colour was that of a very dark green, like the juice of the night-&s;hade berry, and a fluid of the &s;ame colour exuded through its &s;phacelated coats. The nece&s;&s;ity there was of interring the body that evening, put a &s;cop to any further ex|amination.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have been happy, Gentlemen if I had been able to have given you a more particular and accurate de&s;cription of this very &s;ingular ca&s;e, but the above-mentioned circum&s;tances forbad.</P>

periods, which ended in a nephritis; and at length in an haemopto&s;is, when, by coughing, a calculus was thrown out from his lungs, after which he pa&s;&s;ed about 12 years of tolerable health; he liv|ed a &s;edentary life, and was able to pur&s;ue a mod|erate cour&s;e of &s;tudy, and preached occa&s;ionally, until July 1784, when I was con&s;ulted in his ca&s;e. He complained of a general la&s;&s;itude and weak|ne&s;s, attended with a &s;low fever and cough, with a quick, hectical pul&s;e; tho' without any pain in or about the che&s;t. His cough was neither hard nor frequent: he had been riding &s;hort journies, for the purpo&s;e of recruiting his health, and had found &s;o much advantage thereby, that he was de|termined to take a more lengthy one of &s;ome hun|dred miles. But his weakne&s;s and Hippocratic countenance, together with a &s;mall hemoptoe which attended his cough, made me diffident in recommending &s;o lengthy a journey as was propo|&s;ed, and the more &s;o on account of a number of &s;mall calculi, which at different times he had coughed up, tho with le&s;s irritation than might have been expected, they being of very even, &s;mooth &s;urfaces, but of different figures, and ab|out the &s;ize of a large orange &s;eed. But &s;eeing the great confidence he had of the advantages he &s;hould derive from the propo&s;ed journey, I con|&s;ented, rather than advi&s;ed to it, with all the pre|cautions I thought nece&s;&s;ary for one under his in|firmity. He returned in about &s;ix weeks, and ap|peared rather recruited, and continued &s;o until the month of September, when his cough increa|&s;ed, and on the 9th he rai&s;ed about a pint of blood from his lungs; which came &s;o fa&s;t and &s;uddenly upon him, as to threaten an immediate &s;uffocati|on. I was called in the night, but before I arri|ved
<PB N="86" REF="021296_0085_0FB3052D6F557650">
his haemoptoe cea&s;ed. But ju&s;t on my ent|rance into the room he expectorated a large mouth|full, which appeared by candle light to re&s;emble a mixture of blood and pus. This I directed to be thrown into a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el of water, and after maceration, found it to con&s;i&s;t of a portion of the internal membrane of the lungs, about one inch and a quarter in length, and half the breadth, and about a quarter of an inch thick. About this time he expectorated another calculus, after which he continued gradually to decay, until the latter end of December following, when welcome death clo&s;ed the &s;cene.</P>
<P>As this is but the &s;econd ca&s;e of the kind that has fallen under my ob&s;ervation, in the cour&s;e of thirty years practice, I narrate it as &s;omething &s;in|gular, with this remark only, by way of quaere. As, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, many &s;evere pectoral complaints were terminated with a fit of the gra|vel, whether very con&s;iderable relief may not be expected in like ca&s;es, from tho&s;e means which have proved &s;o &s;pecific in re&s;olving and bringing off calculous matter from the kidnies and ure|ters? Which is humbly &s;ubmitted to tho&s;e more &s;kilful and experienced to determine.</P>
