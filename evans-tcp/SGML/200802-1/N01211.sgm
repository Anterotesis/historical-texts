<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>Exod. 18. 21.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Moreover thou &s;halt provide out of all the People, Able men, &s;uch as fear God, men of Truth, Hating Covetou&s;ne&s;s; and place &s;uch over them, to be Rulers of thou&s;ands, and Rulers of Hun|dreds, Rulers of Fifties, and Rulers of Tens.</HI></Q>

<P>WE Read, <HI>Exod.</HI> 2. 18. That <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> fled from <HI>Pharaoh</HI> into the Land of <HI>Midian,</HI> and Married <HI>Zippo|rah,</HI> Daughter of <HI>Jethro, the Prie&s;t or Prince of Midian.</HI> The rea&s;on why he is thus &s;tiled, I conceive may be ga|thered, by con&s;idering the Character that is given of <HI>Job. Job</HI> is &s;uppo&s;ed to be de&s;cended from <HI>A|braham,</HI> and that he lived in the time between <HI>A|braham</HI> and <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> he was the Greate&s;t Man of the Ea&s;t, not only as to <HI>Riches</HI> and <HI>E&s;tate,</HI> but al&s;o in <HI>Maje&s;ty,</HI> and <HI>Authority;</HI> For, <HI>When he went out to the Gate through the City, when he prepared his Seat in the Street. The Young men &s;aw him, and hid them|&s;elves, and the Aged aro&s;e, and &s;tood up. The Princes refrained talking, and laid their hands on their mouth. The Nobles held their peace; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e dwelt as King in the Army.</HI> Job 29. 7, 8, 9, 10, 25. Yet this <HI>Prince</HI> offer|ed

Burnt-Offerings; <HI>Job</HI> 1. 5. Yea, his three Friends were directed to go to him with their Burnt-offer|ing, and he was to Pray for them, which he did, and the Lord accepted him, <HI>Job</HI> 42. 8, 9, 10. Being thus con&s;ecrated by God, he might be &s;tiled <HI>Prie&s;t,</HI> or <HI>Prince.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Jethro</HI> was de&s;cended from <HI>Midian,</HI> the fourth Son of <HI>Abraham,</HI> by his Wife <HI>Keturah,</HI> Gen. 25. 2. and was <HI>Priest,</HI> or <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Midian.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Melchizedeck</HI> King of <HI>Salem,</HI> was <HI>Prie&s;t</HI> of the Mo&s;t High God. <HI>Jethro</HI> owned, and wor&s;hipped the True God, <HI>Exod-</HI> 18. 12.</P>
<P><HI>Mo&s;es</HI> by expre&s;s Command from God, departed from <HI>Midian</HI> to go into <HI>Egypt,</HI> taking his Wife and two Sons with him. <HI>Exod.</HI> 4. 20. But after God ma|nife&s;ted his di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t him, for neglecting to Circumci&s;e his Son; he &s;ent his Wife and Chil|dren back unto <HI>Jethro,</HI> who remained with him un|til the happy Congre&s;s mentioned in this Chapter.</P>
<P>It is conceived that this part of the Hi&s;tory is tran&s;po&s;ed; becau&s;e it appears that this meeting was after the giving of the Law: when <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;at as <HI>Judge;</HI> both to explain the Mind and Will of God to the People, and to determine matters in Controver&s;y according to the Law. That it &s;hould therefore in point of time have been mentioned after the 10th ver&s;e of the 10th of <HI>Numbers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Jethro</HI> had in his own Land, a general account of the wonderful deliverance God had granted his People <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> from the Land of <HI>Egypt,</HI> under the Conduct of his Son-in-law <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> and therefore moves towards him, with his Wife and Children;
<PB N="5" REF="001448_0004_0FB2F380AF73FAD0">
<HI>Mo&s;es</HI> went out to meet him; and after the joyful Congratulation, and they were come into the Tent, <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> gives him a more particular account of the merciful and wonderful di&s;pen&s;ations of Divine Providence towards <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> &s;ince he left him in <HI>Mi|dian.</HI></P>
<P>This filled the heart of the Good old man with joy, <HI>which he expre&s;&s;ed, by acknowledging the tran&s;|cendent Glory, and excellency of the God of I&s;rael; by offering of Burnt-offerings and Sacrifices, and fea&s;ting with</HI> Aaron, <HI>and the Elders of I&s;rael before God,</HI> Exo. 18. 12. &s;o joyning with the Church of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> in the Solemn Wor&s;hip of God.</P>
<P>The day following, <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;at to judge the peo|ple, who &s;tood before him from morning to even|ing; which his wi&s;e Father-in-law ob&s;erving, te&s;ti|fied his di&s;like of, as a method that would be very prejudicial both to him&s;elf, and al&s;o to the people: to prevent the inconvenience, he propo&s;eth an ex|pedient; yet, as a good, as well as a wi&s;e man, &s;ubmits to the determination of God him&s;elf, <HI>v.</HI> 23. <HI>If thou &s;halt do this thing, and God command thee &s;o, thou &s;halt be able to endure, and all this people &s;hall go to their place in peace.</HI> His advice was to provide out of all the people, a certain number of Officers, who might bear the burthen with <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was &s;en&s;ible of the nece&s;&s;ity of complying with this advice, and acknowledged <HI>before the Con|gregation, that he was not able by him&s;elf alone, to bear their cumbrance, their burthen and their &s;trife.</HI> Deut. 1. 12. The people therefore, having by his direction, Cho&s;en a &s;ufficient number of per&s;ons for

divers Offices; <HI>Mo&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> made them Heads over <HI>I&s;ra|el</HI> in &s;everal Di&s;tricts, with a mo&s;t &s;olemn Charge; &s;aving to them, <HI>Hear the Cau&s;es between your Bre|thren, and judge righteou&s;ly between every man, and his brother, and the Stranger that is with him; ye &s;hall not re&s;pect per&s;ons in judgment, but you &s;hall hear the &s;mall, as well as the great; you &s;hall not be afraid of the face of man, for the judgment is Gods; and the Cau&s;e that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it.</HI> Deut. 1&punc; 16, 17.</P>
<P>The <HI>Divine Approbation</HI> of this advice, is mani|fe&s;t by that &s;tanding Law, <HI>Deut.</HI> 16. 18. <HI>Judges and Officers &s;halt thou make thee in all thy Gates, which the Lord thy God giveth thee, throughout thy Tribes, and they &s;hall judge the people with ju&s;t judgment, thou &s;halt not wre&s;t judgment, thou &s;halt not re&s;pect per&s;ons, neither take a gift; for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wi&s;e, and pervert the words of the Righteous; that which is altogether ju&s;t (Ju&s;tice, Ju&s;tice) &s;halt thou follow.</HI></P>
<P>Accordingly that great Reformer, King <HI>Jeho&s;ha|phat</HI> &s;et <HI>Judges in the Land, throughout all the fenced Cities of</HI> Judah, <HI>City by City&punc;</HI> with the like &s;olemn Charge, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 19. 5, 6, 7. He &s;aid to the Judges, <HI>Take heed what you do, for ye judge not for man, but for the Lord, who is with you in the judgment; where|fore now let the fear of the Lord be upon you, take heed and do it: for there is no iniquity with the Lord our God, nor re&s;pect of per&s;ons, nor taking of Gifts.</HI></P>
<P>In the words of the Text, <HI>Jethro</HI> manife&s;ts both his Wi&s;dom, and his Piety, in directing not only to a &s;uitable number of Officers; but to tho&s;e qualifi|cations
<PB N="7" REF="001448_0006_0FB2F388DEE69178">
which were nece&s;&s;ary for the di&s;charge of their duty, in their &s;everal Stations.</P>
<P><HI>Jethro</HI> mentions four qualifications; Able men, &s;uch as fear God, men of Truth, hating Covetou&s;|ne&s;s: <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> mentions three more, Wi&s;e men, and Under&s;tanding, and known among your Tribes, <HI>Deut.</HI> 1. 13. Under the&s;e &s;even, all other good Qualities and Vertues being comprehended; I &s;hall briefly explain, and di&s;tingui&s;h them.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Wi&s;e men,</HI> men of Sagacity, of an acumen or &s;harpne&s;s of under&s;tanding, ea&s;ily, and &s;peedily to penetrate into the nature and qualities of things; men of large Capacities; in a degree an&s;wering the Character of <HI>Solomon&punc; to whom God gave largene&s;s of heart, even as the Sand on the Sea &s;hoar,</HI> 1 King. 4. 29. Men who have right Ideas, notions and con|ceptions, and that in great abundance; men that can di&s;cern the true &s;ence of the Law; and di&s;tin|gui&s;h between things that differ: between plea and plea; and not be impo&s;ed on by the Sophi&s;try of tho&s;e who would pervert Ju&s;tice and Judgment, for filthy lucres &s;ake.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Men of Under&s;tanding, h. e.</HI> of prudence and di&s;cretion; <HI>for wi&s;dom dwells with prudence, and finds out knowledge of witty inventions,</HI> Prov. 8. 12. men that know how to di&s;po&s;e things into a due method and order, in the proper time and &s;ea&s;on; that matters may appear in a clear light, and that Ju&s;|tice may not be deferred, or delayed; delays of|ten proving more pernicious than a wrong Judg|ment.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Men known among your tribes,</HI> not ob&s;cure men,
<PB N="8" REF="001448_0007_0FB2F389A4D55A10">
who hide their Talents in a Napkin; but who have appeared to be of a Publick Spirit, and have given proof of their ability, and fidelity; men of experi|ence, and who de&s;erve a good repute among their Neighbours; as Per&s;ons fit for Publick Service.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Able men,</HI> &s;trong men, men of Fortitude, Cou|rage and Re&s;olution, that will not be diverted from their duty by frowns, nor &s;miles; men that have an antipathy again&s;t Flatterers, and Flattery; men that will dare to do Ju&s;tice, though there are dif|ficulties and dangers in the way.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Fearing God;</HI> not <HI>Athei&s;ts,</HI> nor <HI>Dei&s;ts,</HI> but who know and own the only true God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom he hath &s;ent; Men who have a prin|ciple of Holy Fear in their hearts; con&s;ider them|&s;elves as placed in their Stations by Divine Provi|dence, to act therein for God, to whom they are accountable; Men that dare do nothing contrary to the Mind of God, becau&s;e they fear him: that dare do all that God Commands, becau&s;e they fear him, relying on his protection for their defence and &s;ecurity.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Men of Truth,</HI> or, <HI>True men;</HI> not men of a dou|ble heart, nor double tongue; not <HI>Hypocrites, le&s;t the people be en&s;nared,</HI> Job 34. 30. Men that love Truth, &s;tudy Truth, &s;peak Truth, and will plead for Truth; Men of Faith, who&s;e words and promi|&s;es may be relyed on; Men who will keep <HI>Faith</HI> with the Publick; and be very careful to maintain, and pre&s;erve the <HI>Publick Faith.</HI></P>

or Intere&s;t is &s;ecure, where <HI>Covetou&s;ne&s;s</HI> reigns. <HI>Naboth</HI> found it &s;o; becau&s;e he would not part with his Fathers Inheritance, to &s;atisfie the <HI>covetous</HI> de&s;ire of <HI>Ahab,</HI> a method was found to de&s;troy his Life, that his Vineyard might be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by that <HI>Ahab,</HI> who tho' a King, made him&s;elf a Slave, <HI>Sel|ling him&s;elf to work evil in the &s;ight of the Lord,</HI> 1 King. 21. 20. Therefore in Chu&s;ing Publick Of|ficers, be &s;ure to avoid <HI>Covetous men;</HI> let them be men <HI>Hating Covetou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Doctrine</HI> to be in&s;i&s;ted on, is only this&punc;</P>
<P><LABEL>DOCTRINE.</LABEL> In Chu&s;ing Per&s;ons for Publick Offices, and Employ|ments, there ought to be &s;pecial care that they are men, Hating Covetou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>For the clearing and proving of this <HI>Doctrine,</HI> I &s;hall in&s;i&s;t on two Propo&s;itions.</P>
<P>Propo&s;ition I. <HI>In Chu&s;ing of Per&s;ons for Publick Of|fices and Employments, re&s;pect ought to be had to their Qualifications for &s;uch Offices and Employments.</HI></P>
<P>This is &s;o evident to the light of nature, that no rational man will Chu&s;e a <HI>Servant,</HI> or a <HI>Slave</HI> that is not fit for the work he de&s;igns him.</P>
<P>Here Con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Choice is a free, deliberate and di&s;tingui&s;hing act of the Mind.</HI> In this ca&s;e, it is &s;uppo&s;ed that di|vers
<PB N="10" REF="001448_0009_0FB2F39154B9FFF0">
per&s;ons &s;tand as <HI>Candidates</HI> for &s;uch an Office or Employment. Every Elector hath a determi|ning Vote, <HI>as far as it re&s;pects him&s;elf,</HI> which of the two is be&s;t qualified for &s;uch a Station, and by his Choice te&s;tifyeth a peculiar re&s;pect to the per&s;on he thinks mo&s;t worthy.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>As there are different Offices and Employments&punc; &s;o there are different Gifts which adapt, or fit for &s;uch Offices; and different mea&s;ures and degrees of tho&s;e Gifts. The Father of lights;</HI> from whom every good and perfect gift comes, doth di&s;tribute <HI>common <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> for the good and benefit of Humane Society&punc; as well as <HI>Spiritual Gifts, for the benefit of the Church;</HI> di&s;tributing to every one &s;everally as he will; all are adapted to &s;ome u&s;e or &s;ervice: The greate&s;t <HI>Prince</HI> cannot &s;ay to the meane&s;t <HI>Pea&s;ant,</HI> I have no need of thee&punc; for <HI>the King him&s;elf is &s;erved by the field,</HI> Eccle&s;. 5. 9. not only by the produce of the field, but by the labour of the Husbandman that worketh in the Field. Now Choice ought to have re&s;pect to <HI>Divine Providence;</HI> con&s;idering who is it that the Supreme Governour of the World doth <HI>indigitate; or point me to,</HI> as fitted for &s;uch a Station, by the qualifications he hath be&s;towed up|on him? Election of Officers ought to be attended unto with &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, looking up to God for dire|ction, his Glory is concerned in their management; the judgment is Gods; and they ought to act in his name and fear, for his Glory.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>To have a liberty for Choice, and not to re&s;pect qualifications, is to trifle in a matter of greate&s;t im|portance;</HI> it is to &s;light a priviledge, which &s;ome
<PB N="11" REF="001448_0010_0FB2F392A563F9C8">
<HI>Heathens</HI> would &s;ooner part with their Lives, then their Children &s;hould be deprived of: It is to i|mitate the Sin and Folly of <HI>E&s;au, who for a mor&s;el of meat fold his birth-right.</HI> Oh! how often do men &s;uffer them&s;elves to be impo&s;ed on by tho&s;e who &s;eek their own Intere&s;t, by their neglect or credu|lity&punc; little Emi&s;&s;aries are often imployed, by fal&s;s repre&s;entations to divert from the Choice of the mo&s;t U&s;eful and Vertuous, and to engage a party to &s;erve the <HI>Covetous.</HI> Oh! how often have flou|ri&s;hing Cities and Countreys been lo&s;t, ruin|ed and &s;poiled of all their Glory, by <HI>ungrateful</HI> 80 <HI>perfidious Hypocrites,</HI> who were Cho&s;en to &s;erve the Publick Intere&s;t. It is therefore of the <HI>la&s;t impor|tance,</HI> in chu&s;ing per&s;ons to Publick Offices, to have re&s;pect to their <HI>Qualifications, That they be wi&s;e, un|der&s;tanding, known among the tribes, able men, fear|ing God, men of Truth, Hating Covetou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Which leads to the &s;econd Propo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Propo&s;ition II. <HI>In Chu&s;ing per&s;ons to be Publick Of|ficers, there ought to be &s;pecial care, that they be men hating Covetou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> The holy Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> in giv|ing the qualifications for Bi&s;hops and Deacons, doth in a very particular manner warn again&s;t the <HI>Co|vetous. A Bi&s;hop mu&s;t be blamele&s;s,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>not greedy of filthy lucre, not covetous; likewi&s;e the Deacons mu&s;t be grave,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>not greedy of filthy lucre.</HI> 1 Tim. 3. 3, 8. Tit. 1. 7. <HI>not given to filthy lucre.</HI> As <HI>Covetous</HI> Bi|&s;hops and Deacons are a pe&s;t to the Church, &s;o are <HI>Covetous</HI> Officers to the State.</P>

<P><HI>A. G.</HI> I intend only to explain the nature of the evil, in general; and not to di&s;cour&s;e of the vari|ous ways &amp; methods wherein this Sin doth appear.</P>
<P>A. 1. <HI>Covetou&s;ne&s;s is &s;ometimes u&s;ed as a term that comprehends all irregular and inordinate inclinations, and motions of the Soul towards forbidden Objects;</HI> the fir&s;t motions of depraved nature towards &s;in; the fir&s;t <HI>I&s;&s;ues</HI> of Indwelling &s;in, are termed <HI>Covet|ing, or Lu&s;ting.</HI> Rom. 7. 7. <HI>I had not known lu&s;t, or concupi&s;cence, except the law had &s;aid, thou &s;halt not Covet; but &s;in taking occa&s;ion by the Commandment, wrought in me all manner of Concupi&s;cence. Thus, e|very man is tempted when be is drawn a&s;ide of his own lu&s;t, and enticed; then when lu&s;t&punc; hath conceived, it bringeth forth &s;in; and &s;in when it is fini&s;hed, bringeth forth death.</HI> Jam. 1. 14, 15. <HI>Thus, every imagination of the thoughts of mans heart, are only evil continual|ly.</HI> Gen. 6. 5.

<P>Ina&s;much as my de&s;ign in treating on this Sub|ject, was in a peculiar manner, for the Service of this Town. I &s;hall in the Application humbly of|fer my Advice in three particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Let us be very thankful for the Priviledges we Enjoy.</HI></P>

<P N="3">3. <HI>Manife&s;t that value, by Chu&s;ing men hating Co|vetou&s;ne&s;s, to the &s;everal Offices at your di&s;po&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Adv.</HI> 1. Let this Town be very thankful for the <HI>Mercies</HI> and <HI>Priviledges</HI> it doth yet enjoy, through the favour of our <HI>Gracious God.</HI> When we con&s;ider the many provoking Evils that have been, &amp; &s;till are in it; we mu&s;t acknowledge, <HI>that it is of the Lords mercies that we are not con&s;umed.</HI> This Town is a monument of the <HI>patience, forbearance</HI> &amp; <HI>long|&s;uffering</HI>

of God: it had been con&s;umed and laid in A&s;hes, had not the tender mercies of God prevent|ed; <HI>Many a time may we now &s;ay, had not God been on our &s;ide, the Enemy would have &s;wallowed us up quick; the proud waters had gone over our Soul; but ble&s;&s;ed be God, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth: Our &s;oul is e&s;caped as a bird out of the &s;nare of the fowlers, the &s;nare is broken, and we are e&s;caped. Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made Hea|ven and earth,</HI> P&s;al. 124. Let us con&s;ider, very ma|ny Towns, Cities and Strong Holds (the Ma&s;ter|pieces of Art) have been &s;hattered, beaten down, con&s;umed by fire, plundered and ravaged, during the long War; and yet this Town pre&s;erved; <HI>no Gally with Oars, nor Gallant Ship hath &s;hot a Bullet, nor Bomb again&s;t it; this is the doing of the Lord, &amp; it ought to be marvellous in our eyes;</HI> we ought to <HI>call upon our Souls, and all within us to &s;ing prai&s;es to God, &s;ing prai&s;es, for he hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad,</HI> and <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be his glorious name.</HI> But we are not only <HI>pre&s;erved; we enjoy many mer|cies, we are daily loaden with benefits,</HI> we have a <HI>great mea&s;ure of health, peace and plenty,</HI> while others are con&s;umed by the <HI>Sword, Famine,</HI> &amp; <HI>Pe&s;tilence;</HI> the <HI>Lord dealeth bountifully with us.</HI> To all this. (1.) We enjoy our <HI>Sacred Priviledges;</HI> we have liberty to <HI>Wor&s;hip God</HI> on his <HI>Holy Day,</HI> in the ways of his <HI>own Appointment, and none make us afraid.</HI> We have <HI>faithful Mini&s;ters,</HI> in&s;tructing us in the great <HI>My&s;te|ries of the Go&s;pel,</HI> in the things that <HI>concern our peace; Watchmen upon our walls,</HI> to warn us of our danger, and calling us to <HI>Repentance</HI> and <HI>Reformation:

<P>Adv. 2. <HI>Let us prize and value our Priviledges, &amp; not at a low rate, but as a rich Inheritance.</HI> As the <HI>Con&s;titution of the Engli&s;h Government, is ju&s;tly e&s;teem|ed the mo&s;t excellent in the Earth;</HI> the Priviledges of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> men the greate&s;t; &s;o it hath co&s;t much <HI>Blood</HI> and <HI>Trea&s;ure</HI> to &s;ecure them from <HI>Generation to Generation.</HI> The Glorious God hath marvellou&s;ly <HI>pre&s;erved them;</HI> and &s;hall we <HI>di&s;regard them?

<P>Adv. 2. <HI>Manife&s;t your value for your</HI> Priviledges&punc; <HI>by Chu&s;ing men hating Covetou&s;ne&s;s into all &s;uch</HI> Pub|lick Offices <HI>and</HI> Stations <HI>as are at your di&s;po&s;e.</HI> Con|&s;ider, (1.) <HI>There is no &s;ecurity for any</HI> Priviledge <HI>or</HI> Tru&s;t <HI>committed to a Covetous man:</HI> They are u&s;u|ally timorous and fearful, they are Flatterers and Time &s;ervers; and their greedine&s;s after Riches,

There are indeed <HI>divers Offices in the Town,</HI> which <HI>Qualified men</HI> ought to <HI>attend</HI> out of pure regard to the <HI>publick Good;</HI> as <HI>Members of the Body Politick;</HI> without expecting a <HI>Salary: Men hating Cove|tou&s;ne&s;s</HI> will &s;erve the <HI>Town</HI> in &s;uch <HI>Capacities, readily, chearfully and impartially;</HI> and ought to be treated with Re&s;pect, loved and valued for their Fidelity.

(2.) <HI>Men hating Covetou&s;ne&s;s will be content with a competency;</HI> there is a bound and limit to their de&s;ires in this re&s;pect: <HI>As they pray, that God would feed them with food convenient,</HI> &s;o they <HI>expect no more from man,</HI> but what is &s;uitable to their Station, and Circum&s;tance.

But then Con&s;ider, <HI>If covetous, greedy men be put into &s;uch Stati|ons, what will follow:</HI> They will thus argue, There is a &s;uitable &s;upply for the &s;upport of <HI>me</HI> and <HI>mine,</HI> due to me by all Laws, Divine and Humane; If I <HI>provide <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> for my own, e&s;pecially for tho&s;e of my own hou&s;e, I deny the faith,</HI> h. e. <HI>The Chri&s;tian Faith, and an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> than an Infidel.</HI> I have no other way to &s;ub&s;i&s;t while I live, nor Leave to mine when I Die.

it, and employ all the <HI>Methods</HI> and <HI>Agents</HI> I can, to get that which they unju&s;tly detain from me. And thus often-times <HI>Covetous men</HI> &s;quee&s;e more Trea&s;ure from them, than would &s;upport many others; and they have no remedy; but may &s;et down bewailing their folly, in <HI>with|holding more than was meet.</HI> I be&s;eech you to con&s;ider what mi&s;chief <HI>Covetous men</HI> may do in their &s;everal Offices and Stations; &s;ome by <HI>fal&s;e En|tries,</HI> defacing, or altering of <HI>Records;</HI> by wa&s;ting of <HI>Trea&s;ure;</HI> by unju&s;t <HI>Rates,</HI> and cruel <HI>Exactions,</HI> by denying to <HI>Vote,</HI> or &s;elling of <HI>Votes;</HI> and by innumerable methods, and &s;ubtil devices; and you will perceive they are <HI>dangerous men,</HI> and to be a|voided; they are often (as we term them) <HI>&s;ober men,</HI> and nothing to be objected, &s;ave only in the matter of <HI>Covetou&s;ne&s;s&punc;</HI> they will pretend to &s;ave Charges, but are on all men mo&s;t profu&s;e and la|vi&s;h, will lo&s;e opportunities for doing of Service, and part with rich advantages for the <HI>Publick,</HI> ra|ther than &s;tay a few hours from their own Inte|re&s;t.

innumerable difficulties and temptations; divert them from their Duty, or &s;o clog them; that as di&s;pirited and di&s;couraged men will do little or no Service! It is &s;o contrary to the Go&s;pel, that tho&s;e who are under the power of it, are excluded from the Priviledges of it. <HI>If any man love the World, the love of the Father is not in him:</HI> Such Profe&s;|&s;ors are <HI>Spots</HI> and <HI>Blemi&s;hes; they grieve the Holy, Spirit of God, quench his motions, and cau&s;e him to depart from that people; and provoke the Holy One to give them up to &s;trong delu&s;ions.</HI></P>
<P>Having been thus helped to leave a plain <HI>Te&s;ti|mony again&s;t Covetou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> through Grace I will a|bide thereby; leaving it to the Ble&s;&s;ing of God; and recommend the Advice of our Lord Je&s;us; Luke 12. 15. <HI>Take heed, and beware of Covetou&s;|ne&s;s.</HI></P>
