<HEAD>THE NARRATIVE AND CONFESSION OF THOMAS POWERS, A NEGRO.</HEAD>
<P>I THOMAS POWERS, was born in Wallingford, in Connecticut, Septem|ber 15th, 1796. My father's name is Tho|mas Powers; and my mother before marri|age was Prudy Waterman. I was the &s;e|cond and younge&s;t Son of my father, with whom I lived, till I was two years old. He then put me out to live with Mr. Mo&s;es Tharp, of Norwich, (Conn.) where I re&s;i|ded one year, and then returned to my fath|er, who, being a very pious man, endeavor|ed to in&s;truct me in my &s;everal duties, to God, to my parents, and to all mankind;
<PB N="4" REF="031037_0005_0FEA62384AB52E30">
as far as my young and tender mind was ca|pable of receiving any virtuous impre&s;&s;ions. But I was naturally too much inclined to vice, to profit by his precepts or example; for I was very apt to pil&s;er and tell lies, if I thought there was any occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>When I was nine years old, I was put out to live with I&s;aac John&s;on, of Lebanon, (Conn) where I lived two years, and very early began the practice of villainy and de|bauchery. It was here I began my career in the gratification of that corrupt and law|le&s;s pa&s;&s;ion, which has now brought me to the thre&s;hold of eternity, before my years were half numbered.</P>
<P>Being one Sunday at home from meeting, with nobody but a young Negro woman, who lived in the hou&s;e, &s;he, enticing me to her bed, where &s;he was &s;itting, &s;oon taught me the practice of that awful &s;in, which now co&s;ts me my life; for which together with di&s;obedience to my ma&s;ter, and many other villaneous tricks which I u&s;ed to play upon him, he often corrected me, but to &s;o little purpo&s;e that he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me from his &s;er|vice.</P>
<P>Then I returned once more to my father, where I lived a few months, till he, not lik|ing my behaviour, bound me out to Mr. Oliver Hyde, of Norwich, (Conn.) D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t|ing my re&s;iden<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> with him, who was a pret|ty,

kind ma&s;ter, I was taught to read and write a tolerable good hand; but being nat|urally vicious I improved my talents, (or rather mi&s;improved them) to very bad pur|po&s;es. I u&s;ed to make a point of pilfering whenever I could; for when I &s;aw an op|portunity, the devil, or &s;ome other evil &s;pirit, always gave me a &s;trong inclination. I &s;up|po&s;e it was becau&s;e I was naturally inclined to be light-fingered; for I never he&s;itated to touch any thing that came in my way. Here too I played my pranks, with the young black girls about the &s;treets; and indulged my&s;elf as freely as I could without di&s;covery.</P>
<P>In the year 1789, I broke open a &s;tore in Norwich, (Conn.) owned by Mr.&mdash; took a few articles of goods and fifteen dol|lars in Ca&s;h. In the next place, knowing my pre&s;ent ma&s;ter, Oliver Lathrop, to have on hand a large &s;um of money, I &s;uppo&s;ed that I might take about twenty dollars and neither of us fare the wor&s;e. I, however, &s;oon repented of this bargain; for being di&s;|covered, I was forced to return the money, and take a few &s;tripes on my back; but i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> I had received my ju&s;t de&s;erts I might po&s;&s;ibly have e&s;caped the fate, which now awaits me.</P>
<P>In the year 1793 I moved with my ma&s;ter from Norwich, in Connecticut, to Lebanon, in New Hamp&s;hire, where I &s;oon run the length of my chain, and compleated my vil|lany,
<PB N="6" REF="031037_0007_0FEA623C0EA51988">
committing a number of crimes, which black as I am, I &s;hould blu&s;h to repeat.</P>
<P>Before I removed from Norwich, (Conn.) I attempted to ravi&s;h a young girl, who was vi&s;iting in the neighborhood. For this pur|po&s;e, I took an old &s;word, and went into the woods where I &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he would return in the evening, and concealed my&s;elf in the bu&s;hes, where I waited till 12 o'clock; but as providence ordered it, &s;he did not go home that night, and &s;o e&s;caped the &s;nare I had laid for her.</P>
<P>On the 7th day of Dec. 1795, being at work with Mr. Gordon Lathrop, I agreed to meet him in the evening, at Thomas Rowels, to wre&s;tle. Accordingly a little af|ter &s;un down I &s;at out, without any evil in|tentions. I overtook a young woman, whom I knew to be &mdash; I pa&s;&s;ed on by her, a pretty good jog, till after a little querying with my&s;elf, and finding nothing to oppo&s;e, but rather the devil to a&s;&s;i&s;t me, I determi|ned to make an attempt on her virgin cha&s;|tity.&mdash;So I way Laid her, and as &s;he came up, &s;eized her with one hand, and her hor&s;e's bridle with t'other, &s;he a&s;k'd me what I want|ed?&mdash;I told her to di&s;mount and I would tell her. At the &s;ame time taking her from her hor&s;e, I threw her on the ground, and in &s;pite of her cries and entreaties, &s;ucceeded in my helli&s;h de&s;ign. Then left her, and
<PB N="7" REF="031037_0008_0FEA52A764BED470">
went to the place propo&s;ed, where I found my antagoni&s;t; but the evening being far &s;pent, I returned to my ma&s;ter's hou&s;e and &s;at down, as u&s;ual, to play chequers with the children.</P>
<P>It was not long before I heard people round the hou&s;e, and was afterwards infor|med they were after me; but &s;eeing me &s;o lively at play, &s;ays the <ABBR>E&s;q.</ABBR> "It can't be Tom"&mdash;&s;o they went away. I &s;oon went to bed; but in about two hours, I was a|waked from &s;leep by a number of people who entered my room, and called me their "pri|&s;oner."</P>
<P>I was confined, till next day, when I had my trial before <ABBR>E&s;q.</ABBR> Hough, who &s;entenced me to pri&s;on; accordingly I was immedi|ately &s;ecured in Haverhill jail, on the 10th day of Dec. As we were pa&s;&s;ing by the place, where the crime was committed, I was que&s;tioned concerning the fact; but, I, like a hardened villain, as I was, denied ev|ery &s;yllable of the truth, and had but little &s;en&s;e of my &s;ituation, till the key of the pri|&s;on was turned upon me, when my feelings were &s;uch as no pen or tongue, can de&s;cribe. On the fifth of April, after 4 months con|finement, with the help of two of my com|panions we broke goal after three hours hard work. We went to the river, &s;tole a boat, ran three miles down, and &s;ent her adrift.

One of my com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ads, by the name of Bayley, went to his father's, where he procured &s;ome refre&s;hment for u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.&mdash;</P>
<P>From thence, we went to Capt. Frye Bailey's in Newbury, where we &s;tole a hor&s;e, and went fifteen miles to Ryegate. On Sun|day evening we arrived at St. John&s;bury, &amp; took up lodgings in a barn. At twelve we took up our line of march, and returned to B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t, where I parted with my compani|ons; It being my object to go to Portland, and &s;hip my&s;elf aboard o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> a ve&s;&s;el. I, how|ever, mi&s;&s;ed my road and came back to Lit|tleton where I enquired for&punc; Lake Champ|lain, and as I was going quite the other way, I was &s;u&s;pected of being a rogue, and I confe&s;s they had &s;ome grounds for their &s;u&s;picion, as one of them was acquainted with me. I was, of con&s;equence, imme|diately returned to my old lodgings in Hav|erhill. Here I was now hand-cuffed, and my arms pinioned; and put into the upper loft of the Pri&s;on: but on Sunday, the 4th day after my la&s;t commitment, I &s;awed of my pinions acro&s;s the grates of the pri&s;on; and with the help of a knife, got a piece of board, with which I pryed off the grate. I then went to work to cut up my blanket, in|to &s;trips, and tying them together from the grate, I de&s;cended from the upper loft. As I pa&s;&s;ed by the grate of the lower room, I
<PB N="9" REF="031037_0010_0FEA6242F9609940">
called to the pri&s;oners below telling them, of my liberty but de&s;ired them to &s;ay nothing till I had got off; but Holmes &s;wore he would &s;top me, if in his power, and imme|diately rai&s;ed the Jailor.&mdash;I ran as fa&s;t as I could, after being almo&s;t &s;pent with fatigue, in getting my liberty, and de&s;cending from the upper loft, with hand-cuffs on; and while they were looking for me in the mo&s;t ob&s;cure places, near the Goal, &s;uppo&s;ing me to be there concealed; but I made my e&s;cape into the river road, and at break of day, I found my&s;elf at Capt. John Mann's in Or-ford. I then thought it prudent, to avoid di&s;covery, to go back into the woods, where I lay till night.</P>
<P>I then proceeded on to Lyme, and broke into a black&s;mith &s;hop, to rid my&s;elf of my Hand cuff's which in my travels, I found rather uncomfortable companions, and I &s;u&s;pected, in ca&s;e of being &s;een and noticed, they would prove but a poor recommenda|tion. However I could not &s;ucceed; &s;o I went on to Gould's Tavern, and took a hor&s;e, which I rode about three miles; but not be|ing able to get him any farther, I attempted to drown him to get my revenge; but could not ea&s;ily &s;ucceed, and I left him to &s;hirk. I then proceeded on to a &s;mith's &s;hop on College Plain, where I made another fruit|le&s;s attempt to get my hands at liberty.
<PB N="10" REF="031037_0011_0FEA6244834D7968">
When I got into the edge of Lebanon, it was day light; &s;o I wandered about in the woods till evening, when I went to Mr. Quimbe's &s;hop in Lebanon and &s;awed, and twi&s;ted my hand-cuffs about two hours, and gave out being quite overcome for want of food. I then went to my ma&s;ter's hou&s;e, looked in at the window, but guilt being my companion, I dared not enter. I then retired &s;ome di&s;|tance from the hou&s;e and &s;awed my cuffs acro&s;s a rock, till by the help of a file, I liberated my hands, and went to Mr. T. Rowel's, whom I &s;uppo&s;ed to be a friend; But he, like mo&s;t friends, in adver&s;ity, for|&s;ook me, and turned my enemy. For upon &s;eeing how cold and hungry I was, he &s;eem|ed to pity me, and told me to go to a cer|tain barn, and he would bring me &s;ome re|fre&s;hment; but in&s;tead of victuals, he mu&s;|tered all the force he could to take me. Be|ing however, aware of his treachery, when day light appeared, I fled to the woods, and lay there, where I &s;uffered extremely with the cold. Upon &s;eeing them come into the woods I lay down under a log, and as they pa&s;&s;ed along one of them trod on me, but did not perceive me. I then thought be&s;t to &s;hift my cour&s;e, and taking a cro&s;s lot, one of them &s;aw me, as I a&s;cended a little ri&s;e of ground, and nailed me. I pointed to a barn at &s;ome di&s;tance, and &s;aid, "he has ju&s;t
<PB N="11" REF="031037_0012_0FEA624867C46F68">
gone by the barn.&mdash;" which turned the at|tention of the whole that way; he then &s;up|po&s;ed me to be one of their party, as it was between day light and dark.</P>
<P>This gave me a little breath again, and I thought of trying to get &s;ome refre&s;hment by milk, from a cow of my ma&s;ter's, as I had not eat or drank for nigh 4 days, but could not find her, where I expected. I however found &s;ome raw potatoes and eat of them freely. At la&s;t I took up a re&s;olution to u&s;e my hand-cuff bolt, for my defence, and to go into the hou&s;e; which I did, but &s;ound none but children round the tea-table, who where exceedingly frightened, and run away, all but a boy, who told me to take what I wanted, if I was hungry. I &s;eized half a chee&s;e, and half a loaf of bread, which was on the table, and ran off. I &s;oon met a Mr. Colburn, who knew me, and told me to go with him, and nobody &s;hould hurt me adding that I &s;hould have any refre&s;hment I wanted. I followed him home, and no &s;ooner had we got there, than he &s;ent to inform my pur&s;uers. I &s;tept to the door, and &s;aw them coming over the hill&mdash;I &s;tarted to run and Colburn &s;truck at me, but I e&s;caped and ran till I fainted and fell. His dog followed me, however, and barked till they came up and took me, as their pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>The time of my trial was now come on, and and in&s;tead of carrying me to Haverhill, I was carried to Plymouth, where I immediately had my trial before the Hon. Superior Court, and was &s;entenced, very ju&s;tly, to death. At fir&s;t, upon hearing my &s;entance, it had no impre&s;&s;ion on my mind&mdash;for my heart was hardened beyond
<PB N="12" REF="031037_0013_0FEA624AAAFFD3E8">
de&s;cription. After a little reflection, however, I fainted, and could not &s;peak for &s;ome time.&mdash;At length I came to my&s;elf, and de&s;ired to &s;ee the young Lady, whom I had injured. This &s;he refu&s;ed, but &s;aid &s;he, would receive any me&s;&s;age I wi&s;hed to &s;end to her. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;et do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> and wrote a confe&s;&s;ion of my crime, and of the ju&s;t|ne&s;s of my puni&s;hment. I begged pardon, mo&s;t &s;incerely for the injury, I had done her. She &s;ent me for an&s;wer, that &s;he could forgive me, and hoped that God would do the &s;ame. I was then conducted to pri&s;on and bound with irons. During my re&s;idence here under &s;ent|ence of death, I have not been wholly in&s;en&s;ible of my pitiable &s;ituation; as my ma&s;ter as well as the divines who have attended me, have ever endeavored to impre&s;s me with a &s;en&s;e of a &s;tate of future happine&s;s or mi&s;ery to which I was de&s;tined; but the &s;ecret hope of making my e&s;cape, and, the jollity of countenance that ap|peared in mo&s;t of my &s;pectators; did in &s;ome mea&s;ure bani&s;h the idea of death from my mind. The ninth of June, a number of Doctors made application to me for my BODY, for DISSECTION, after my execution; to which I readily con&s;ent|ed for the &s;mall &s;um of ten dollars, thinking it might afford me a comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tance while here, and my BONES be of &s;ervice to mankind after the &s;eperation of &s;oul and body, which mu&s;t &s;hortly take place, and at which time may I re|ceive forgivene&s;s of all mankind, and of my God, before whom I mu&s;t appear through the merits of a Redeemer.</P>
