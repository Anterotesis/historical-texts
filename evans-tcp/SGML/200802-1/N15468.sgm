<P>WE are a&s;&s;embled on this joyful anniver&s;ay of our public liberty:&mdash;liberty obtained at the expence of much blood and trea&s;ure; with decency becoming a chri&s;tian &s;tate, we now appear in this &s;acred place, fir&s;t to pay our religious ac|knowledgements to the SUPREME RULER, and to collect &s;ome in&s;truction from the oracles of truth: that &s;pecial pro|vidence which prevents the worthy reverend brother<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Rev.

<Q>Who then is a faithful and wi&s;e &s;ervant, whom his Lord hath made ruler over his hou&s;ehold, to give them meat in due &s;ea&s;on? ble&s;&s;ed is that &s;ervant, whom his Lord when he cometh, &s;hall find &s;o doing: Verily I &s;ay unto you he &s;hall make him ruler over all his goods.</Q>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY RESPECTED HEARERS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AMONG the many metaphors u&s;ed in &s;a|cred &s;cripture, expre&s;&s;ive of the duty and &s;ubjection we owe to God our Father, and our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; that of a &s;ervant is perhaps the mo&s;t frequent. It is u&s;ed with the highe&s;t propriety; for it is ju&s;t in its &s;elf, and adapted to convey ideas of the highe&s;t importance to us. For he who made us, he who provides for us, &s;up|porting both &s;oul and body in all their noble powers and organs, has &s;urely an unlimitted right to our &s;ervices. He, who has redeemed us unto God with his own mo&s;t precious blood, that we might be to him <HI>a peculiar people, zealous of good works,</HI> has the highe&s;t claims upon us, and may ju&s;tly expect we &s;hould glorify him in our bodies &amp; in our &s;ouls which are the Lords. In a word, he may ju&s;tly expect, that, in our re&s;pective &s;tations and characters, we &s;hould yield all ready obedi|ence
<PB N="5" REF="019705_0005_0FAC9B9363C26758">
and &s;ubjection to him, who has laid down his precious life for us.</P>
<P>AND indeed, my friends, the true &s;ervants of Je&s;us Chri&s;t glory in their character: they e&s;teem it their highe&s;t dignity, that they are now no longer &s;ervants and &s;laves, to the prince of the power of this world; nor to their own vile lu&s;ts: but that the ble&s;&s;ed &s;on of God hath made them free: though other Lords have had dominion over them, yet henceforth they will make mention on|ly of his name.</P>
<P>SERVANTS mu&s;t do their ma&s;ters work, and keep ever in view, as their rule and guide his commands and will: they mu&s;t do their work with cheerfulne&s;s,&mdash;with &s;inglene&s;s of heart,&mdash;and good fidelity; though their ma&s;ter may appoint to &s;ome more work, to others le&s;s, according to their &s;everal abilities; yet all have &s;omething on their hands by his appointment of importance to be done. Nor does the &s;ubordination of labour|ers, or that of their work, at all prevent their holding one common title, under their great Lord: they are all his &s;ervants, and ble&s;&s;ed be his name, if they are faithful, however they may rank among them&s;elves, they &s;hall <HI>all</HI> in the la&s;t day,

receive a mo&s;t gracious reward from their divine ma&s;ter, in the pre&s;ence of attending angels, and an a&s;&s;embled world.</P>
<P>THE &s;ervant mentioned in the text, &s;eems to have been one greatly honored with peculiar ta|lents and entru&s;tments; he is made ruler over his ma&s;ters hou&s;ehold, his character and po&s;t are ap|plicable, with &s;ome &s;pecial propriety, to <HI>Magi&s;|trates</HI> and <HI>Mini&s;ters.</HI></P>
<P>MAGISTRATES are appointed, by the wi&s;e and good providence of heaven, to rule among men, in &s;ubordination to, and in immitation of him, "who him&s;elf rules the world in righteou&s;ne&s;s, and judges the people with equity." The holy Apo&s;tle Paul accordingly roundly a&s;&s;erts, <HI>that the powers that be, are ordained of God.</HI> They are, in this &s;en&s;e even under the pre&s;ent di&s;pen&s;ation, <HI>the Lord's annointed,</HI> appointed by him mini&s;ters of God for good. They have in their exalted &s;tations, the &s;olemn oath and charge of God impo&s;ed upon them, to regard &s;upremely his honor, to promote the great end of their delegated power, and the <HI>pub|lic good.</HI> They are commanded to be <HI>ju&s;t,</HI> to <HI>fear God,</HI> to <HI>hate coveteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and ever to bear in mind that <HI>God is with them in the judgment.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="019705_0007_0FAC9B94E654CE20">
THESE are his honored &s;ervants in the <HI>State,</HI>&mdash;the earthly political hou&s;ehold of the Lord: they are appointed to do his work, to promote the hap|pine&s;s of the <HI>Commonwealth,</HI> which is the great end of all political government;&mdash;<HI>to give to every one his meat in due &s;ea&s;on,</HI> and advance, to their utmo&s;t, the great de&s;igns of God's moral govern|ment in the world: Happy are the&s;e his honored &s;ervants, <HI>whom when their Lord cometh, he &s;hall find &s;o doing: Verily I &s;ay unto you, he &s;hall make them rulers over all his goods;</HI> their &s;tations &s;hall be marked with di&s;tingui&s;hed honor in the world of &s;upreme glory.</P>
<P>MINISTERS mu&s;t con&s;ider them&s;elves under the character of <HI>&s;ervants</HI> in the church of the liv|ing God: their work is &s;piritual, their charge is great, and their account will be mo&s;t &s;olemn. By the great <HI>head</HI> of the church they are made ru|lers in his &s;piritual hou&s;ehold, <HI>which is the church of the living God;</HI> they are appointed to this office, not to <HI>Lord it over mens faith,</HI> or con&s;ciences; but to be <HI>helpers of their joy;</HI> and to <HI>give to every one his portion of meat in due &s;ea&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>GREAT wi&s;dom and faithfulne&s;s are nece&s;&s;ary in mini&s;ters, in order to their acquiting them|&s;elves
<PB N="8" REF="019705_0008_0FAC9B95A1EE0900">
to God and their own con&s;ciences: though as mini&s;ters of that kingdom of their ble&s;&s;ed Lord, which is not of this world, they are not to inter|fere with matters of government, nor a&s;&s;ume <HI>lordly titles</HI> over their fellow &s;ubjects; yet it mu&s;t be allowed, they have a mo&s;t important depo&s;i|tum committed to them; they have an arduous work on their hands; they have been <HI>charged in the pre&s;ence of God and the holy angels, to watch for &s;ouls as tho&s;e who mu&s;t give account;</HI> they are urged to be found faithful in the hou&s;ehold of God, by innumerable motives of the highe&s;t moment; one only might be thought &s;ufficient; they are the <HI>&s;ervants</HI> of mens <HI>&s;ouls</HI> for <HI>Chri&s;t's &s;ake.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, my re&s;pected hearers, while we have pointed out magi&s;trates and mini&s;ters as e&s;pecial|ly de&s;igned in the &s;acred pa&s;&s;age, we are con&s;ider|ing, let none of this a&s;&s;embly con&s;ider them&s;elves as wholly di&s;intere&s;ted in the &s;ubject in hand; for per&s;ons of every age, rank and character have &s;omething intru&s;ted them by the great Lord of the hou&s;ehold; they have &s;ome talents to improve for the well-being of the State to which they be|long; the honor of Chri&s;t and the edification of the church.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="019705_0009_0FAC9B9661B72250">
WE have all the proper work of <HI>time</HI> a&s;&s;igned us, in whatever po&s;ts we are placed. There is &s;omething to be done, for our&s;elves and &s;ociety.&mdash;Something in our power to effect, either by our heads, our hearts, or our hands. We mu&s;t all <HI>be diligent in bu&s;ine&s;s, and fervent in &s;pirit, &s;erv|ing the Lord.</HI> I &s;ay again, time, and all its im|portant concernments, are talents intru&s;ted us by the great <HI>Lord</HI> of <HI>all;</HI>&mdash;and wo unto us, if by indo|lence, or attention to other things, things compa|ratively of no importance, we <HI>wrap the&s;e talents up in a napkin,</HI> and leave them unimproved.</P>
<P>BUT give me leave to con&s;ider, a little more di&s;tinctly, the character of wi&s;e and faithful &s;er|vants, as it is conci&s;ely drawn by our Lord in the text.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed then, that they <HI>know</HI> the <HI>duties</HI> of their particular &s;tations; and what <HI>ta|lents,</HI> are intru&s;ted them for their improvement.</P>
<P>ONE, who is wholly ignorant of his Lord's will; who either cannot, or will not under&s;tand the duties, of his particular &s;tation; or in what way he ought to &s;erve God and man, cannot be numbered among, either the wi&s;e, or the faithful
<PB N="10" REF="019705_0010_0FAC9B97216E3270">
&s;ervants. The good &s;ervants, therefore of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, will not fail to enquire with diligence, after their ma&s;ter's will; and carefully con&s;ider what are the duties, which e&s;pecially be|long to that department, he has a&s;&s;igned them: Their language, from time to time, will be, like that of Saul, in his way to Dema&s;cus, <HI>Lord, what would&s;t thou have me to do?</HI></P>
<P>THE &s;ervant in the text, is called a <HI>wi&s;e</HI> &s;er|vant, not only becau&s;e it is our highe&s;t wi&s;dom to be faithful; but becau&s;e he was <HI>prudent,</HI> being well in&s;tructed in all the duties of his &s;tation.</P>
<P>AGAIN, wi&s;e &s;ervants, will keep in their proper &s;pheres.</P>
<P>THEY will not intermeddle with things which lie out of their line, or above their capacity. <HI>Wherein God hath called them, therein they will abide with God.</HI> They will diligently attend upon the bu&s;ine&s;s of their own proper &s;tations; they will con&s;ider what are the talents intru&s;ted them; and be concerned to improve tho&s;e they <HI>have,</HI> not tho&s;e they <HI>have not.</HI></P>
<P>THE want of this kind of wi&s;dom, has intro|duced, both into the church and &s;tate, great di&s;|orders.
<PB N="11" REF="019705_0011_0FAC9B97E182FAC0">
Hence have proceeded tho&s;e violent at|tacks, on that order of prie&s;thood, which God him&s;elf, e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Jewi&s;h oeconomy: Hence the &s;tory of <HI>Korah, Dathan, and Abiram;</HI> as you will &s;ee at large in <HI>Num.</HI> XVI, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the be|ginning. Hence al&s;o that unhappy king <HI>Uzziah,</HI> who thur&s;t him&s;elf into the prie&s;t's office, and was &s;truck, by the hand of the Lord, with the plague of lepro&s;y, for his prophane pre&s;ump|tion: You will read the account of this memora|ble event in 2d <HI>Chron.</HI> XXVI. <HI>chap.</HI></P>
<P>NOR has the chri&s;tian church been free from the &s;ad effects of the &s;ame &s;pirit. Many have <HI>run before they were &s;ent:</HI> and tho&s;e <HI>who kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">w not what are the fir&s;t principles of the oracles of God,</HI> have imagined they were quite equal to the mo&s;t ar|duous undertaking;&mdash;that they could <HI>&s;top the mouth of gain&s;ayers,</HI> and <HI>rightly divide the word of truth, giving to every one, his portion in due &s;ea&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the State has been as much infe&s;ted, with this proud and &s;elf-advancing &s;pirit, as the church. While mode&s;ty, with great abilities, has been contented in her humble &s;tation; though in the truth of facts, one of the highe&s;t recommen|dations to public tru&s;t; the &s;elf-confident a&s;&s;ur|ance, of &s;ome ignorant, overbearing per&s;ons, ei|ther

by the bra&s;s in their face, or the gold in their pur&s;e, have pu&s;hed them&s;elves into places, which they could neither fill with dignity, nor re&s;ign without humiliating regret. Hence, the wi&s;e king <HI>Solomon,</HI> long &s;ince ob&s;erved a <HI>&s;ore evil under the &s;un, namely, &s;ervants on hor&s;e-back, and princes walking by their &s;ide.</HI></P>
<P>AGAIN, faithful &s;ervants, are &s;uppo&s;ed to be well acquainted, with the <HI>ends</HI> and <HI>purpo&s;es,</HI> to which their talents and entru&s;tments, mu&s;t be applied. The glory of the great Lord of all, and the happine&s;s of mankind, command their highe&s;t attention. They know that God is glo|rified, when the great purpo&s;es of his moral go|vernment, are an&s;wered; the&s;e centre in the hap|pine&s;s of mankind. For "the Father of Being is the Father of mercies, a principle of boundle&s;s active love; and though infinitely various in ex|ecution, his de&s;ign is one, his own glory, or which is evidently the &s;ame thing, the happine&s;s of his creatures, is the centre in which all the lines of his government unite. Every thing takes place in the univer&s;al &s;y&s;tem, according as it tends to the accompli&s;hment of this great parental pur|po&s;e." The duties, therefore of the &s;econd table, or what we owe to our fellow &s;ervants, will be
<PB N="13" REF="019705_0013_0FAC9B9961D82770">
eyed with great attention. The religion of our Divine Ma&s;ter, is mo&s;t kind and beneficent: The go&s;pel it&s;elf is a manife&s;tation of divine love, di|rected to it's proper object,&mdash;the &s;alvation of a ruined world. Every attentive per&s;on, mu&s;t ob|&s;erve, that it is well adapted to promote, civil and &s;ocial happine&s;s: For, it inriches the heart with every virtue, which tends to adorn human nature, and to increa&s;e the common &s;tock of &s;ocial hap|pine&s;s. "It forms the wi&s;e and prudent parent,&mdash;the amiable child,&mdash;the affectionate brother,&mdash;the generous friend; but above all, the judicious, upright and con&s;i&s;tent magi&s;trate; who ri&s;es &s;u|perior, not only to views of per&s;onal intere&s;t; but what is often more expre&s;&s;ive of true great|ne&s;s, the prejudice of party, and the blind impul&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion; who with the knowledge and govern|ment of his own heart, is unmoved by the fro|ward humours of the world around him; and whether they frown or flatter, he remains fixed in his purpo&s;e, of promoting their happine&s;s."&mdash;Thus faithful &s;ervants, influenced by the princi|ples of our holy religion, will ardently de&s;ire, and a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly endeavor to promote the well-being of all around them; e&s;pecially of tho&s;e who are committed to <HI>their</HI> care in their character of ma|gi&s;trates or mini&s;ters. The &s;ervant in the text,

gave the hou&s;hold, their meat in due &s;ea&s;on: It was his <HI>fidelity in this branch of his character,</HI> his Lord empha&s;i&s;ed, and remarked with &s;o much kind re&s;pect.</P>
<P>BE a&s;&s;ured, my re&s;pected friends, faithful &s;er|vants are not only acquainted with the duties of their re&s;pective &s;tations; and know the ends which &s;hould command their highe&s;t attention; but they are con&s;tantly and con&s;cienciou&s;ly con|cerned to di&s;charge the&s;e duties, and to an&s;wer the end of their appointment, to &s;uch particular &s;tations, in the oeconomy of God's moral govern|ment.</P>
<P>ARE they rulers?

<P>ARE they mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel? it is their great concern to <HI>obtain mercy of the Lord to be found faithful.</HI> They give them&s;elves wholly to their proper work; <HI>warning every man&mdash;and teaching

<P>ARE they parents or ma&s;ters? they are con|&s;cienciou&s;ly concerned <HI>to walk in their hou&s;es with a perfect heart.</HI> They behave with kindne&s;s, gen|tlene&s;s, and fidelity towards tho&s;e committed to their care and government:&mdash;They endeavor to teach them by precepts, and their own examples, the true fear of the Lord. Con&s;ider them in any,&mdash;in all the dear &s;ocial connexions of life, you will &s;ee them <HI>kind and courteous, tender hearted and pitiful;</HI> endeavouring to exhibit them&s;elves a patern to others, in the full exerci&s;e, of all the &s;ocial virtues and graces of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>To &s;um up all in few words; they, who are wi&s;e and faithful &s;ervants, employ all their abili|ties, and improve all their opportunities, in their re&s;pective &s;tations, for the glory of God, and the welfare of mankind. Their time,&mdash;their health,&mdash;their dignities,&mdash;their &s;ub&s;tance,&mdash;the gifts and graces of the go&s;pel,&mdash;and all their advantages, of either doing good to others; or of obtaining e&s;&s;ential benefit to them&s;elves: all the&s;e are con|&s;ecrated and devoted, to the honor of their great

<P>IF, according to your original de&s;ignation, you are indeed <HI>the mini&s;ters of God for good;</HI> if you are wi&s;e and faithful, always <HI>&s;eeking the peace of God's people;</HI> if you give to the hou&s;hold their meat in due &s;ea&s;on, by a <HI>ju&s;t and wi&s;e legi&s;lation,</HI> and by a <HI>faithful</HI> and <HI>energetic execution</HI> of good laws; then duty, love and gratitude oblige us, to pay you
<PB N="18" REF="019705_0018_0FAC9B9D212CDFC8">
high honor and re&s;pect. Yea, it is in the code of go&s;pel precepts, enjoined us, not only to <HI>fear God,</HI> but to <HI>honor &s;uch civil rulers,</HI> we are com|manded <HI>to &s;ubmit our&s;elves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's &s;ake;</HI> and we ought, by the &s;ame divine authority, to <HI>render cu&s;tom, (or tribute,) to whom cu&s;tom, fear to whom fear, and honor to whom honor is due.</HI> Every citizen therefore, who de|&s;erves the protection of the laws, &s;o far from ca&s;t|ing any reproach on your character; or weak|ening your hands, by calumniating in&s;inuations, will &s;how you every mark of dutiful re&s;pect; &amp; en|deavour to &s;trengthen your hands, in the di&s;charge of the duties of your public character.</P>
<P>YOUR duty, and your dignity go hand in hand: They are e&s;&s;entially connected together. The rule and mea&s;ure is plainly drawn,&mdash;drawn by your <HI>own</HI> hands, in the <HI>con&s;titution</HI> of this State, from which you have &s;olemnly <HI>&s;worn</HI> you will not de|viate. <HI>This</HI> you will therefore, carefully &s;tudy in all its branches. You will con&s;ider it of great importance, to know, the&s;e &s;tatutes and ordinan|ces, that you might not tran&s;gre&s;s: You will re|collect that, for this end, the princes of God's an|cient people, were divinely enjoined, to write out, with their own hands, the Mo&s;aic con&s;titution.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="019705_0019_0FAC9B9DE140E8B0">
GIVE me leave, to remind you, that it is the <HI>con&s;titution,</HI> and <HI>con&s;titutional laws,</HI> to which the people have pledged their fidelity and obedience; and not to any body of men, however otherwi&s;e re&s;pectable. The moment therefore, you &s;hould pre&s;ume to rai&s;e your&s;elves, in political importance, above the con&s;titution, you would forfeit your political dignity; and &s;tand upon the &s;ame ground, with the lowe&s;t voters in the &s;tate. Did I &s;ay, upon the &s;ame ground? I correct my&s;elf: For &s;uch voters are &s;uppo&s;ed to be free, from every charge, of public infidelity: But you would be liable to be called upon, to an&s;wer for your un|faithfulne&s;s, at the tribunal of an injured people.</P>
<P>DETERMINED to make this your main guide; you will exert your combined efforts, fully to di&s;|charge, that public confidence your fellow citi|zens, have repo&s;ed in you. And &s;urely, you can|not fail to recollect, that the wi&s;e and faithful &s;ervant, whom his Lord made ruler over all his hou&s;hold, gave them their meat in due &s;ea&s;on: This was the principal part of his duty! this he faith|fully di&s;charged. When you con&s;ider therefore, your&s;elves appointed by the &s;ame Lord, through the voice of the people, to be rulers over this part of his hou&s;hold; and that the very end of this
<PB N="20" REF="019705_0020_0FAC9B9EA16E51B0">
appointment, is, that you might have it in your power, to give every member his portion of meat in due &s;ea&s;on;&mdash;this con&s;ideration, will &s;urely annihilate every low motive;&mdash;every &s;pecies of party &s;pirit, and &s;elfi&s;h views: For the&s;e would be likely to draw off your attention, from the pub|lic emolument, and fix it on your own families, or near connexions. You will reprobate, with the highe&s;t indignation, the idea of de&s;ecrating the important <HI>depo&s;itum</HI> committed to you, to the un|worthy purpo&s;es, of feeding <HI>your&s;elves</HI> only, and not the whole hou&s;hold.</P>
<P>THUS united, and in earne&s;t to promote the public welfare of every part of this State, you will immediately find important bu&s;ine&s;s crowding from every quarter, on your heads,&mdash;your hearts, your hands: For, the pre&s;ent &s;uffering circum|&s;tances of the hou&s;hold, call aloud for your im|mediate care.</P>
<P>BUT mode&s;t propriety, and a full conviction of my own inability, to lead you through the laberinth of public labors, forbid my making any attempt of the kind.</P>
<P>ONLY, let me ob&s;erve, the &s;carcity of a circula|ting

medium;&mdash;the low State of our national credit, and commerce;&mdash;the poor multiplying in all our towns;&mdash;inattention to the natural &s;ources of our wealth;&mdash;<ABBR>viz.</ABBR> agriculture; manufactures: well regulated commerce; and e&s;pecially that oeco|nomical prudence, which is e&s;&s;ential to the public pro&s;perity of every people; the&s;e are &s;ubjects, which call aloud for the united wi&s;dom and en|ergy of this honorable court.</P>
<P>A revi&s;ion of &s;uch acts, as have been &s;uppo&s;ed, incon&s;i&s;tent with the con&s;titution:&mdash;The appoint|ment of proper per&s;ons, to repre&s;ent you in Con|gre&s;s, per&s;ons, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of talents adapted to &s;erve in that very important &s;tation, and adorned with &s;uch a chri&s;tian character, as you would wi&s;h to have exhibited, as a &s;ample of your own chri&s;tian morality, before other chri&s;tian nations;&mdash;toge|ther with the appointment to other offices in the State as there may be a call for them;&mdash;as al&s;o means to reward &s;uch as are faithful, without di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the people;&mdash;the&s;e undoubtedly are objects, worthy the notice and careful attention, of this re&s;pected court.</P>
<P>THE &s;carcity of men of literary abilities, and the importance in which the ri&s;ing generation,
<PB N="22" REF="019705_0022_0FAC9BA050093598">
are ju&s;tly held, by all the wi&s;e in every nation, e&s;pecially in infant Sates, will &s;urely turn your paternal eyes on our youth. You will wi&s;h to have their young minds, cultivated under the &s;kil|ful hand of able and religious in&s;tructors;&mdash;&s;uch as are capable, at lea&s;t, of teaching them the ru|diments of our own language; and in&s;tructing them, by their own examples, in the principles of chri&s;tian morality. If there are good laws al|ready enacted on this &s;ubject, it is pre&s;umed you will endeavor to give more energy to &s;uch, as have hitherto, utterly failed of an&s;wering their &s;aluta|ry de&s;ign.</P>
<P>IN a word, your watchful and compa&s;ionate eyes will pervade every part of the hou&s;hold: Your hearts will feel for <HI>all:</HI> And your hands of ju&s;tice,&mdash;truth&mdash;and goodne&s;s will be employed for <HI>all.</HI> And ble&s;&s;ed are ye, if when your great Lord calls you from your pre&s;ent di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;ta|tions, either by death, or in any other way, you &s;hall be found &s;o doing.</P>
<P>HIS mouth &s;hall ble&s;s you, who has all pow|er of ble&s;&s;ing in his hands: And whom he ble&s;&s;es, is ble&s;&s;ed indeed. You &s;hall have peace in your own con&s;ciences: <HI>the peace of God, which pa&s;&s;eth

all under&s;tanding, &s;hall keep your hearts and minds, through Chri&s;t Je&s;us:</HI> Heavens ble&s;&s;ings &s;hall be implored upon you, by all the wi&s;e and good: You &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed with more wi&s;dom and grace; and perhaps, with further intru&s;tments: For, to him who thus hath, thus faithfully improves what he hath, we may ju&s;tly expect more &s;hall be given: Your fellow citizens &s;hall ble&s;s you: Yea, children yet unborn, &s;hall have your names tran&s;mitted them, with high honor.</P>
<P>BUT above all, your Lord and ma&s;ter in Heaven &s;hall ble&s;s you&punc; and pronounce, in the great day of his appearing, that happy <HI>euge</HI> on you: <HI>Well done, good and faithful &s;ervants, ye have been faith|ful in a few things, I will make you rulers over many things; enter ye into the joy of your Lord.</HI></P>
<P>To conclude; let this whole a&s;&s;embly be im|pre&s;&s;ed with a deep &s;en&s;e, of the infinite importance of fidelity in their re&s;pective ranks. God's eye is ever fixt on us all: As there are none above his controul, &s;o there are none below his notice: We &s;hall all &s;tand together, before the <HI>bar of Chri&s;t,</HI> there&mdash;&s;olemn thought! there to render up our re&s;pective accounts, of the various talents intru&s;ted us; and to be judged according to the

<P>THEN, all rule and authority, &s;hall be put down: For Chri&s;t the great Me&s;&s;iah, <HI>&s;hall reign, till all things are put under his feet.</HI> O, therefore, let us <HI>now</HI> ki&s;s the &s;on, le&s;t he be angry with us, and we peri&s;h in that day; <HI>ble&s;&s;ed are all they that put their tru&s;t in him</HI></P>
