<OPENER><SALUTE>MEN, BRETHREN, and FATHERS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE completion of a <HI>century</HI> of years &s;ince the incorporation of this town deter|mined me to bring you a di&s;cour&s;e on this opportunity of the &s;everal &s;ocieties and de|nominations being a&s;&s;embled together. You will &s;uffer me to introduce the memorable occa&s;ion of the en&s;uing di&s;cour&s;e, and my de&s;ign of giving a brief hi&s;torical account of the town, with a few reflections on the re|ality, extent, duration and morality of divine providence; grounded on the following words of the p&s;almi&s;t,
<Q><BIBL>PSALM CXLVI.10.</BIBL>
<P>THE LORD SHALL REING FOR EVER, EVEN THY GOD, O ZION, UNTO ALL GENERATIONS. PRAISE YE THE LORD.</P></Q></P>
<P N="1">I. FIRST, Of the <HI>reality</HI> and <HI>extent</HI> of di|vine providence&mdash;the admi&s;&s;ion of which is e&s;&s;ential to natural religion, as on the &s;uppo&s;ition of it all revelation pro|ceeds.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="011622_0004_0F8777439F019388">FROM the things that are made we as clearly &s;ee, as we do that there is a GOD, a &s;upream director at the head of the univer&s;e; &s;u&s;taining every part of it, every being in it, and <HI>working all things after the coun&s;el of his own will.</HI> That GOD is, and that he go|verns the world, are coincident principles, proveable the &s;ame way, Con&s;equently, the antient <HI>Epicurians,</HI> who profe&s;&s;ed to believe a GOD, while they denied a providence, were, in truth, athei&s;ts.</P>
<P>WE &s;ee, indeed, but few of GOD's works&mdash; only <HI>parts of his ways</HI>: We are but little ac|quainted with the nature and de&s;ign, u&s;e and references, of many, of mo&s;t of tho&s;e we do &s;ee: However, we know enough to beget an undoubting faith in the unlimitted dominion of JEHOVAH&mdash;that the LORD GOD OMNIPOTENT REIGNETH&mdash;Reigneth in heaven, on earth, in all worlds, cele&s;tial, terre&s;trial and infernal. "The heavens de|clare the glory of GOD: The firmament &s;heweth his handy work. Day unto day ut|tereth &s;peech, and night unto night &s;heweth knowledge. There is no &s;peech nor lan|guage, where their voice is not heard." The air, earth and &s;ea proclaim his being and providence. The rank of <HI>&s;en&s;itive</HI> creatures ri&s;es, by an imperceptible gradation, from the lowe&s;t degree to the full perfection of
<PB N="7" REF="011622_0005_0F88E15E8103CFB8">
animal life. <HI>Here,</HI> we perceive "inactive matter creeping into life:" <HI>There,</HI> &s;tronger appearances of life and &s;en&s;e; till we come to tho&s;e animals who&s;e in&s;tincts approach &s;o near rationality as to be &s;carce di&s;tingui&s;hable from it. Not to mention the various kinds of animals&mdash;the multitudes of each kind&mdash;e&s;|pecially of &s;ome &s;orts.</P>
<P>In the next rank of beings, the <HI>human &s;pecies,</HI> what countle&s;s numbers of the&s;e are there, to whom <HI>the in&s;piration of the</HI> AL|MIGHTY <HI>hath given under&s;tanding,</HI> in addi|tion to the common in&s;tincts and appetites of animal creatures? whom the creator hath formed <HI>in his own image?</HI> How different and various al&s;o are the capacities and ad|vantages of the human kind?</P>
<P>FURTHER, we are pretty certain, that <HI>we</HI> are far from being the highe&s;t order of finite creatures, however &s;uperior to the other in|habitants of this vi&s;ible world. Rea&s;on and philo&s;ophy fully acquie&s;ce in the informati|on given us in the &s;acred oracles, of <HI>angels that excel in &s;trength</HI>&mdash;of "thrones and do|minions, principalities and powers, in hea|venly places"&mdash;of a "train which fills GOD's temple" above, &s;urrounding the throne of his glory. For alth&ocirc; we are ignorant "what varied beings people other worlds," yet the declarations of &s;cripture are credible; where
<PB N="8" REF="011622_0006_0F8777457208DA68">
we read, "Thou&s;and thou&s;ands &s;tand before him, ten thou&s;and times ten thou&s;and mini|&s;ter unto him."&mdash;With re&s;pect to whom the SUPREAM is de&s;cribed as <HI>ruling in the ar|mies of heaven.</HI></P>
<P>Now all the variety and harmony, gran|deur and magnificence, vi&s;ible in the ma|terial creation; all this great family in hea|ven and earth; while they evidence the in|finite intelligence, the "eternal power and godhead," of the former and di&s;po&s;er of 'em, witne&s;s alike the energy and extent of his providence. Shall we a&s;cribe to <HI>fate</HI> or <HI>chance</HI> the revolutions of the heavenly bo|dies? the alternate return of "day and night, &s;ummer and winter," &s;pring and autumn; "&s;eed-time and harve&s;t?" material things adapted to the enjoyment of &s;en&s;itive and ra|tional creatures? the various u&s;e of the o|cean, and bounds within which it is confi|ned? There is no medium between a&s;cri|bing the continuance of the material world as it is to fate or chance, and the acknow|ledgement of a &s;uperintending providence; thro' which things continue in their original relations and &s;ub&s;erviency to each other.&mdash; The heavenly luminaries according to his ordinance who fir&s;t bid 'em &s;hine&mdash;the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of the &s;ea&s;ons by his appointment, who "has &s;et all the borders of the earth,
<PB N="9" REF="011622_0007_0F877745E1713FB0">
and made &s;ummer and winter" in virtue of who&s;e promi&s;e "&s;eed-time and harve&s;t, cold and heat, day and night, do not cea&s;e"&mdash;who "renews the face of the earth," and "cloths the gra&s;s of the field"&mdash;The &s;ea, according to the "decree" he fir&s;t gave it&mdash;who, as he gave, continues the in&s;tincts in the lower a|nimals&mdash;"hears the young ravens when they cry"&mdash;without whom "a &s;parrow does not fall to the ground"&mdash;who "pre&s;erveth man and bea&s;t. The eyes of all wait on him," to re|ceive from his liberal hand the &s;upply of their various and con&s;tantly returning wants. The &s;ubjection of the lower animals to mankind, (many of which, did they know their own &s;trength, were they laid under no re&s;traint, could ea&s;ily de&s;troy us) is one &s;ignal proof of that providence we are con&s;idering.</P>
<P>THAT GOD actuates the powers of na|ture; that beings animate, rational and an|gelic are nece&s;&s;arily dependent on the power that formed 'em, are indeed truths, which, perhaps, no rea&s;oning can make plainer than they are on the bare propo&s;al. The &s;ettled, uniform cour&s;e of things, no le&s;s than parti|cular, &s;triking interpo&s;itions, demon&s;trate the uncontroulable power and providence of him, who "&s;iteth on the circle of the earth, and counteth the inhabitants of it as gra&s;s-hop|pers." Indeed, the de&s;ign of &s;pecial inter|po&s;itions
<PB N="10" REF="011622_0008_0F87774766A04E40">
&s;eems to be to rou&s;e the attention of unthinking mortals to tho&s;e general evi|dences of his being and providence, which they have every day before their eyes. Se|cond cau&s;es are &s;ometimes &s;u&s;pended and over ruled, that the world may &s;ee they are under the direction and controul of the fir&s;t cau&s;e; dependent on him for their operations and effects. Sometimes we <HI>&s;tand &s;till, and &s;ee the &s;alvation of GOD,</HI> while the mo&s;t probable means are un&s;ucce&s;sful: Th&ocirc;, in a more general way, the providence of GOD concurs to favor ju&s;t means and endeavors. GOD is re&s;tricted to no particular manner of working. And if in every common in&s;tance we may trace his operation, how much more in tho&s;e great events, which determine the &s;tate of kingdoms? in "enlarging the nations, and &s;traitning them again?" in "&s;etting up and puting down kings?" "For GOD is judge," and "ruleth in the kingdoms of men." His power over the nations is re&s;embled to that of the potter over the clay. They "are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the &s;mall du&s;t of the ballance: Behold, he tak|eth up the i&s;les as a very little thing: And Lebanon is not &s;ufficient to burn, nor the bea&s;ts thereof &s;ufficient for a burnt-offering. All nations are before him as nothing, and they are counted to him le&s;s than nothing, and vanity."</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="011622_0009_0F8777481CC449D0">As all power is of GOD, derived from him, and &s;ubject to him, and "the hearts of all men in his hands," he can "turn them," with|out infringing the moral agency of his crea|tures, and make them mini&s;ter to his de&s;igns, be&s;ide their own intention. Nothing can happen, in any part of the univer&s;e, among the infinite variety of creatures, without his appointment or permi&s;&s;ion "Thine, O Lord, is the greatne&s;s, and the power, and the glo|ry, and the victory, and the maje&s;ty: For all that is in the heaven, and in the earth, is thine: Thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou art exalted as head above all."</P>
<P N="2">II. IN regard to the <HI>duration,</HI> or <HI>perpetuity</HI> of divine providence, this &s;eems to be im|ply'd in the general doctrine already laid down. For in admitting that GOD &s;upports and governs all, we &s;uppo&s;e his <HI>continual</HI> a|gency. If he withdraw his &s;u&s;taining pow|er one moment, the frame of nature would be out of cour&s;e, and things at once fall into confu&s;ion. "The &s;pirit would fail before him, and the &s;ouls which he hath made." They can as well &s;ub&s;i&s;t altogether without him, and exi&s;t forever as they are, as be &s;elf pre&s;erved a &s;ingle moment. No <HI>po&s;itive ex|ertion</HI> of the Deity is nece&s;&s;ary to the de|&s;truction of all things. Let the governor of the world <HI>&s;u&s;pend</HI> his influence and &s;upport,
<PB N="12" REF="011622_0010_0F87774A47985218">
and in&s;tant ruin mu&s;t follow. What we are wont to a&s;cribe to natural or &s;econd cau&s;es, is more properly the agency of the Deity on material things; and his concurrence with his creatures, at lea&s;t &s;o far as to uphold their powers of exertion. GOD's kingdom has been &s;et up ever &s;ince there have been any beings to govern. "The watchmen of I&s;rael neither &s;lumbers nor &s;leeps." "His king|dom is an everla&s;ting kingdom." Th&ocirc; the heavens, and earth, and elements &s;hall at length be di&s;&s;olved; yet he <HI>&s;hall reign for ever.</HI> And hence "there is no wi&s;dom, nor under&s;tanding, nor coun&s;el again&s;t the Lord."</P>
<P N="3">III. BUT let us, in the next place, make a few reflections on the particular <HI>character</HI> of this exten&s;ive providence we have been taking a general &s;urvey of. Though the pre&s;ent &s;tate is by no means the completion of it, and <HI>our</HI> world but a &s;mall part of the dominions of the ALMIGHTY, whence we mu&s;t needs be very incompetent judges of his admini&s;tration, and very much in the dark with regard to many things in it; yet that it is of a <HI>moral</HI> kind, we cannot doubt. The operations of our own minds, and what we may ob&s;erve of it in this dark &s;tate, fully evidence it to be &s;o. From the natural no|tices GOD hath given us of him&s;elf, we clear|ly infer, that <HI>the &s;ceptre of his kingdom is a
<PB N="13" REF="011622_0011_0F87774B1E3C0168">
righteous &s;ceptre that he loves righteou&s;ne&s;s, and hates wickedne&s;s.</HI> Con&s;cience witne&s;&s;eth this when ever it applauds or reproaches us. The&s;e &s;entiments are al&s;o confirm'd from what we &s;ee in the cour&s;e of providence. <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s evermore exalteth a nation: But &s;in is the unfailing reproach of any people.</HI> We moreover ob&s;erve in particular per&s;ons, that "the eyes of the Lord run to and fro thr&ocirc; the earth, that he may &s;hew him&s;elf &s;trong in behalf of 'em who&s;e hearts are perfect with him. His eyes are upon the righteous, and his ears open to their cry. But the face of the Lord is again&s;t 'em that do evil, to cut off the memory of them from the earth." While virtue tends to lengthen life, and contributes to the ea&s;e and happi|ne&s;s of it&mdash;while it procures e&s;teem and con|fidence from men, even from the vicious 'em&s;elves; it appears, on the other hand, that &s;uch as are "wicked over-much die be|fore their time"&mdash;that "bloody and deceitful men do not live out half their days." Be|&s;ides the puni&s;hments inflicted on profligate offenders by the hands of <HI>civil ju&s;tice</HI>; po|verty, &s;hame and mi&s;ery are the <HI>natural ten|dency</HI> of many &s;orts of wickedne&s;s. <HI>This</HI> at lea&s;t, which the prophet declares, holds true of all wicked men, in an higher or lower degree, that they "are like the troubled &s;ea,
<PB N="14" REF="011622_0012_0F87774CA8B13898">
when it cannot re&s;t&mdash;There is no peace to the wicked. They travel with pain all their days, and in the mid&s;t of their &s;ufficiency are in &s;traits." This "wounded &s;pirit" is more than all the evils of life. "The good man," on the contrary, "is &s;atisfied from him&s;elf." The con&s;cious approbation of the Deity, and hope of the cele&s;tial kingdom, fixeth his heart; &s;o that in&s;tead of fearing any tempo|ral &s;ufferings, he even "glorieth in tribulation. Having nothing, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth all things."</P>
<P>THESE things, which I can only hint at, without mentioning others, &s;hew what &s;ort of providence GOD exerci&s;eth over the world. They verify the declaration of the prophet, "I am the Lord, which exerci&s;e <HI>loving-kind|ne&s;s, judgment and righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> in the earth." Whatever in&s;tances may &s;eem at pre&s;ent to militate again&s;t the &s;uppo&s;ition of &s;uch an ad|mini&s;tration, we may be a&s;&s;ured will be found to comport here with, when we come into that world where they "&s;ee not thr&ocirc; a gla&s;s darkly." Let us patiently wait the i&s;&s;ue of things for the manife&s;tation of GOD's righ|teou&s;ne&s;s. <HI>He is the rock, his work is perfect, and all his ways are judgment: A</HI> GOD <HI>of truth, and without iniquity, ju&s;t and right is he.</HI></P>
<P>BY taking a view of our text, we &s;hall have a particular illu&s;tration of the foregoing
<PB N="15" REF="011622_0013_0F87774D65E059A0">
idea of divine providence. <HI>The Lord &s;hall reign for ever, even</HI> THY GOD, O ZION! While GOD is the father of <HI>all mankind,</HI> the profe&s;&s;ors of the true religion are, in a <HI>di&s;|tingui&s;h'd</HI> &s;en&s;e, "his people, and children of the living GOD." The Jews were "a pecu|liar people to him above all people. He &s;hewed his word unto Jacob, his &s;tatutes and judgments unto I&s;rael, and dealt not &s;o with any nation: The Lord hath cho&s;en ZION! He hath de&s;ired it for his habitation. This is my re&s;t forever." And hence the children of ZION are &s;tired up to "be joyful" in him who is in a peculiar &s;en&s;e "THEIR king." To them e&s;pecially are tho&s;e words apply'd, THIS GOD IS MY GOD FOR EVER AND EVER.</P>
<P>BUT is not this a <HI>partial</HI> di&s;tinction? Does it not prove, contrary to what is above &s;up|po&s;ed, that "there is re&s;pect of per&s;ons with GOD?" To this we reply, that what was heretofore the prerogative of the Jews, is now under the go&s;pel the privilege of all that call upon the name of the LORD.&mdash;That th&ocirc; the Jews' advantage was, that "to 'em were committed the oracles of GOD, and that to them pertained the promi&s;es;" yet the original promi&s;e to the father of that nation expre&s;&s;ly comprehended <HI>all nations and families of the earth.</HI>&mdash;That when the
<PB N="16" REF="011622_0014_0F87774E2946B620">
&s;eed promi&s;ed to Abraham, which was the hope of I&s;rael, appeared, and gave direction for the promulgation of his religion, it was in the&s;e terms: "Go teach ALL NATIONS" &mdash;Go into ALL THE WORLD, and preach the go&s;pel to EVERY CREATURE&mdash;That the <HI>highe&s;t</HI> and mo&s;t <HI>important</HI> &s;en&s;e, in which GOD declares him&s;elf "the GOD of Abraham, I&s;aac and Jacob," is a privilege belonging to tho&s;e only who have <HI>the &s;ame &s;pirit of faith</HI> &mdash;are conform'd to the divine moral cha|racter. For "they are not all I&s;rael, who are of I&s;rael: Neither becau&s;e they are the &s;eed of Abraham, are they all children." Yea, "many &s;hall come from the ea&s;t, and from the we&s;t, from the north, and from the &s;outh, and &s;hall &s;it down with Abraham, I&s;aac and Jacob in the kingdom of GOD: But the children of the kingdom &s;hall be ca&s;t out into outer darkne&s;s." The rea&s;on is plain: "For the kingdom of GOD is not meat and drink, but righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace, and joy in the holy Gho&s;t." He is a <HI>cove|nant</HI> GOD and <HI>portion</HI> to tho&s;e only who have the power as well as form of godline&s;s. All to whom the go&s;pel kingdom is preach|ed for a witne&s;s, have the nece&s;&s;ary means of obtaining this highe&s;t honor and happi|ne&s;s, that ZION's king will be <HI>their</HI> GOD, in the mo&s;t <HI>eminent</HI> &s;en&s;e&mdash;their exceeding great and everla&s;ting reward.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="011622_0015_0F87774EDD413648">DOTH it not hence follow, that <HI>happine&s;s</HI> is the great <HI>end,</HI> and <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> the unalter|able <HI>rule,</HI> of the divine admini&s;tration? The provi&s;ion and mi&s;&s;ion of a SAVIOR to the redemption of all mankind, that GOD might be <HI>ju&s;t,</HI> as well as <HI>merciful,</HI> in the ju&s;tification of penitent believers in JESUS&mdash;His being anointed <HI>king</HI> in ZION&mdash;having the promi&s;e of "the heathen for his inheritance, and the uttermo&s;t parts of the earth for a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion" &mdash;the a&s;&s;urance we have that his kingdom of truth, peace and righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall uni|ver&s;ally prevail, call upon us to rejoice in the divine government; and to expre&s;s our gra|titude by our highe&s;t prai&s;es for the great things done for us, and for all mankind. "Ju&s;t and true are thy ways, thou king of &s;aints! Who &s;hall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy." The &s;criptures in&s;truct us, that the GOD and FATHER of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, (who is "<HI>in him</HI> the father of mer|cies, and GOD of all grace") in con&s;equence of his humiliation and vicarious &s;ufferings, "hath highly exalted him;" "given him all power in heaven and earth;" and "will judge the world in righteou&s;ne&s;s by him"&mdash; That "he mu&s;t reign, till he hath put down all rule, and all authority and power, and &s;ubdued all enemies under his feet." In
<PB N="18" REF="011622_0016_0F87774F9DDD9588">
the hands of this mighty Savior, having the promi&s;e of his guardian&s;hip, the children of ZION need not doubt the &s;ecurity of the church, and &s;afety of all their intere&s;ts&mdash;that the kingdom of righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace will triumph over all oppo&s;ition. Founded on a rock, th&ocirc; the rain de&s;cend, and the floods come, and winds blow, they cannot over|throw it. For <HI>thy</HI> GOD, O ZION, <HI>&s;hall reign for ever, and of his kingdom there is no end.</HI></P>
<P>THE kingdom of the Redeemer, &s;mall in it's beginnings, made a mo&s;t rapid progre&s;s under the mini&s;try of the apo&s;tles and fir&s;t di&s;ciples, notwith&s;tanding every po&s;&s;ible ob|&s;truction. To the fir&s;t preachers of it (who&s;e indu&s;try and zeal in &s;preading it is wonderful to think of) the apo&s;tle applies what is &s;aid of the heavenly luminaries, "Their &s;ound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world." And th&ocirc; many nations have fallen off from chri&s;tianity, and others have not as yet had it preached to 'em; yet, according to &s;cripture prophecy, we ex|pect the time when "the kingdoms of this world &s;hall all become the kingdoms of our LORD, who &s;hall reign for ever and ever." How di&s;tant this period is, belongs not to us to conjecture; "the Father having re&s;erved the times and &s;ea&s;ons in his own power." Thus much is clear from ST. PAUL, that
<PB N="19" REF="011622_0017_0F8777505B95AD10">
as "the ca&s;ting away of the Jews was the riches of the world, the receiving of them will be <HI>life from the dead</HI> to the Gentiles." The Jews are not yet re&s;tored. Con&s;equent|ly, the fulne&s;s of the Gentiles is an event yet to be looked for. When the&s;e events &s;hall take place, then there will be no difference between the peculiar title of ZION's GOD, and his being the GOD of <HI>all the families of the earth.</HI> For "all people, nations and languages &s;hall &s;erve and obey him."</P>
<P>BUT while this univer&s;al prevalence of true religion is an event we cannot but exult in the pro&s;pect of, and for which we daily pray when we u&s;e tho&s;e words, THY KING|DOM COME; it is, at the &s;ame time, a mo&s;t melancholy reflection, which we are obliged to make, on the amazing corruption of chri&s;tianity, which hath been permitted. The cau&s;e the apo&s;tle a&s;&s;igns; "They received not the love of the truth, that they might be &s;aved. And for this cau&s;e GOD &s;hall &s;end them &s;trong delu&s;ion, that they &s;hou'd believe a lie; that they all might be damned, who believed not the truth, but had plea&s;ure in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s." You readily perceive I allude to the ri&s;e of "the man of &s;in, the &s;on of perdition, who oppo&s;eth and exalteth him|&s;elf above all that is called GOD, or that is wor&s;hiped"&mdash;and "who&s;e coming is after
<PB N="20" REF="011622_0018_0F8777511EC36978">

During this long period, the few &s;ervants of Chri&s;t, who "had not wor|&s;hiped the bea&s;t, nor received his mark in their foreheads," might be tempted to think, that the promi&s;e of ZION's king, to defend his church, had failed; or at lea&s;t to en|quire, "How long, O LORD, holy and true!"</P>
<P>AT length (th&ocirc; &s;o late as the beginning of the XVIth. century) the &s;ervants of Chri&s;t were &s;pirited to &s;et forward the REFORMA|TION; and the glorious work was marvel|lou&s;ly &s;ucceeded in their hands.

teaching elder of New-Haven church. He moved with his family hither, April 1673, the town having agreed to build him an hou&s;e. He had an annual &s;alary before any church was gather'd here. The 3d day of the 2d month, 1674, was ob&s;erved as a day of fa&s;ting and prayer, previous to the form|ing a church of Chri&s;t in the place. And on the 15th of the &s;ame month, the following year, the town voted,
<Q>That as there had been con&s;ent about e&s;tabli&s;hing a church of Chri&s;t in the afore&s;aid town, and a &s;o|lemn day &s;et apart and ob&s;erved by the town unanimou&s;ly to &s;eek GOD's guidance in &s;o great a work, they have now al&s;o actually and unanimou&s;ly concluded, if it be the will of GOD, that there &s;hall be a church gathered, <HI>and to walk according to the</HI> CONGREGATIONAL WAY; and have al&s;o actually and unanimou&s;ly left the ma|nagement of the &s;ame in the hands of Mr. Mo&s;s, Mr. Samuel Street, Mr. Brocket, Elia&s;aph Pre&s;ton, John Hall &s;en'r.

<P><PB N="29" REF="011622_0027_0F87775B9D97D610">NO doubt the church was form'd &s;oon after this, and under Mr. Street's pa&s;toral care: Th&ocirc; no record is to be found of the preci&s;e time of either.</P>

<P>THE idea our fathers had of a church of Chri&s;t appears from hence to have been this: "The voluntary, explicit, &s;olemn covenant|ing of a number of per&s;ons to walk together in the profe&s;&s;ion and order of the go&s;pel&mdash; that their <HI>own</HI> act and engagement with each other con&s;titutes them a church of Chri&s;t&mdash; that they have, therefore, full power to form

<P>THERE doth not appear to have been the lea&s;t deviation from, or alteration in, this plan, but an entire conformity to it, in this church, at and after the ordination of the Rev.

<P>He was a man of high &s;pirit, and cou'd never re&s;t until he brought on the war, which i&s;&s;ued in his de&s;truction. He was the object on who&s;e life or death war or peace, depend|ed. Fir&s;t or la&s;t mo&s;t of the Indians in New-England join'd him. And it was a que&s;tion with &s;ome whether the Indians wou'd not prevail to a total extirpation of the Engli&s;h inhabitants."

<P>IN 1681, forts were renewed in this town. In 1690 February 26th, was an order of the town to fort in the meeting-hou&s;e.

The &s;ignal extirpation of the &s;avages, toge|ther with the con&s;ideration of their re&s;i&s;ting all attempts to convert 'em to the Chri&s;tian faith, renders it not improbable, that they may be a devoted people.

<P>HERE it may be proper to remind you, that the New-Haven planters made a fair pur|cha&s;e of any exclu&s;ive right the Indians might have to Quinnipiack, which (as before &s;aid) contained the greater part of the bounds of this town. Their deed of it is dated Dec. 1638&mdash;which was renewed 1645. But on pretence of the Indians, that they had made a re&s;erve of &s;ome appurtenances in former grants, another purcha&s;e was made, and a valuable con&s;ideration given for an unre&s;er|ved deed of "12 large miles long, and 8 broad;" the breadth extending from "Whar|ton's brook, to Pilgrim's harbor." The ad|dition of 3 miles to the breadth, from the la&s;t mention'd place; was made by the go|vernment. This Indian deed is dated at Hartford, May 24. 1681, acknowledged be|fore Mr. Treat, then governor of the colony. The purcha&s;e was made by Samuel Street, John Mo&s;s, Nathanael Merriman, John Brocket, Abraham Doolittle. <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">John Brocket died March 12. 1690, Aet. 80.&mdash;Abra|ham Doolittle Augu&s;t 11. of the &s;ame year.

I have given you the exact number of deaths in the &s;e|cond and third &s;ocieties &s;ince their formati|on; and in the fir&s;t and fourth &s;ocieties, and church of England, &s;ince my &s;ettlement in the town. Yet in &s;uming up the whole number for the century now compleated, I have been able to proceed on probable prin|ciples only.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t wave the matter (and, indeed, had no de&s;ign) of giving any directions relating to the particular bu&s;ine&s;s before you. Mo&s;t of you, I pre&s;ume, came determin'd as to the di&s;tribution of your votes&mdash;on <HI>ju&s;t</HI> principles, I hope. To attempt the conviction of any who may have determin'd on other princi|ples, wou'd, I fear, be a fruitle&s;s labor. I

wou'd only remind you of the advice of one, who knew how to a&s;&s;ert and improve his freedom. "Brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only u&s;e not liberty for an oc|ca&s;ion to the fle&s;h, but by love &s;erve one another."</P>
<P>NOR is there time left for tho&s;e reflections, which the preceeding di&s;cour&s;e and the oc|ca&s;ion of it &s;ugge&s;t: I mu&s;t, however, beg your patience while I only mention a num|ber of u&s;es and inferences, which a review of both brings to mind.</P>
<P>WE are caution'd again&s;t attributing to means and in&s;truments, what is to be a&s;cri|bed to the energy of Almighty GOD, who worketh all in all.</P>
<P>FURTHER, we may not indulge to negli|gence and &s;loth under a nation that events are &s;o fixed and determined as to &s;uper&s;ede human endeavors.</P>
<P>INSTEAD of prying into the &s;ecrets of di|vine government, we are taught to re&s;t con|tent with what lies plain to our view, and concerns the regulation of our hearts and lives.</P>
<P>WE are moreover taught to tru&s;t his pro|vidence, who ruleth &s;upreme over all, with our intere&s;ts&mdash;re&s;igning our&s;elves to his di&s;|po&s;al&mdash;and walking with GOD.</P>

us what con&s;titutes the pro&s;perity and hap|pine&s;s of a people.</P>
<P>WE are al&s;o taught to view the reference, which the &s;cheme of divine providence at pre&s;ent hath to a future &s;tate, and more compleat manife&s;tation of GOD's righteou&s;|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE particular recollection of the favors of heaven to the Briti&s;h nation, to New-England, to this colony, to our progenitors of this town, to our&s;elves, is adapted to in|&s;pire us with gratitude and prai&s;e. Let us evidence &s;uch a temper by imitating the piety of our ance&s;tors, that GOD may be with us, as he was with them. They came to this country on religious motives. They were &s;ignally protected and pro&s;pered. From being "few in number," <HI>their latter end has greatly increa&s;ed.</HI> We deny not but they had mi&s;takes&mdash;&s;uch as the be&s;t of frail mor|tals have been incident to. If in any re|&s;pects we have a more improved knowledge, yet have we not abated in chri&s;tian zeal and purity of life? In&s;tances of the neglect of family wor&s;hip cou'd &s;carce be found in their days; how numerous are &s;uch in&s;tances in ours? How are family government and good order, and religious education of children, wherein they &s;hewed a laudable care, now di&s;regarded? How &s;trict were they in their

ob&s;ervation of the Lord's-day? how carele&s;s and loo&s;e are we? And are not profanene&s;s and intemperance vices continually growing in the land&punc; Let us "remember from whence we are fallen, and repent, and do our fir&s;t works."</P>
<P>THE retro&s;pect we have taken in this di&s;|cour&s;e reminds us of the brevity of life, and &s;hould &s;erve to quicken us in the work for which we were born, and &s;ent into the world. "One generation pa&s;&s;eth away, and another generation cometh. Our fathers where are they?" They have "told us what GOD did for them in their day:" And
<Q>the mercy of the Lord is from everla&s;ting to everla&s;ting upon them that fear him; and his righ|teou&s;ne&s;s unto childrens children: To &s;uch as keep his covenant, and to tho&s;e that remember his commandments to do 'em.</Q>
In a little time <HI>we</HI> mu&s;t "go to the generation of our fathers." Let us be ambitious to act our part well on the &s;tage &mdash;to tran&s;mit the be&s;t of ble&s;&s;ings to tho&s;e that come after us: That "in&s;tead of the fathers, there may be the children," who &s;hall "be to the LORD for a generation:" That when we &s;hall have done with all &s;ub|lunary things, we may join the ble&s;&s;ed in|habitants of the world above, in "wor&s;hip|ing him that &s;itteth on the throne, and
