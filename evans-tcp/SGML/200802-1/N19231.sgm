<BIBL>LUKE viii.18.</BIBL>
<Q>Take heed therefore how you hear.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Occa&s;ion of our LORD's giving this Caution was this: Perceiving that much People were gathered together, to hear him, out of every City, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd knowing, (for he is GOD and knoweth all Things) that many, if not mo&s;t of them, would be Hearers only, and not Doers of the Word, he &s;pake to them by a Parable, wherein, under the Similitude of a Sower, that went out to &s;ow his Seed, he plainly intimated how few there were among&s;t them who would receive any &s;aving Benefit from his Doct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ine, or bring forth Fruit unto Perfection.</P>
<P>The Application, one would imagine, &s;hould be plain and obvious: But the Di&s;ci|ples, as yet unenlightened in any great Degree by the Holy Spirit, and therefore unable to &s;ee into the hidden My&s;teries of the Kingdom of GOD, dealt with our Saviour, as People ought to deal with their Mini&s;ters&mdash;di&s;cour&s;|ed
<PB N="3" REF="025033_0003_0FCD8412EA68A0E0">
with them privately about the Meaning of what he had taught them in Publick, and with a &s;incere De&s;ire of doing their Duty, a&s;ked for an Interpretation of the Parable.</P>
<P>Our ble&s;&s;ed LORD, as he always was wil|ling to in&s;truct tho&s;e that were teachable (here|in &s;etting his Mini&s;ters an Example to be courteou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;y o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Acce&s;s) freely told <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hem the Signification of it. And withal, to make them more cautious and more attentive to his Doctrine for the future.

And as their improving the Know|ledge already imparted, was the only Condi|tion upon which more was to be given them, it therefore highly concerned them to <HI>take heed how they heard.</HI></P>
<P>From the Context then it appears, that the Words were primarily &s;poken to the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves. But becau&s;e they were the Re|pre&s;entatives of the whole Church, and 'tis to be feared out of tho&s;e many Thou&s;ands that flock to hear Sermons, but few comparatively &s;peaking are effectually influenced by them; I cannot but think it very nece&s;&s;ary to remind you of the Caution given by our LORD to his Di&s;ciples, and to exhort you with the ut|mo&s;t Earne&s;tne&s;s to <HI>take heed how you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI></P>
<P>In Pro&s;ecution of which De&s;ign I &s;hall in the following Di&s;cour&s;e,

<ITEM><PB N="4" REF="025033_0004_0FCD8413D69D5650">II. SECONDLY, I &s;hall lay down &s;ome Cau|tions and Directions, in order to your hearing them with Profit and Advantage.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I. And, FIRST, I am to prove that every one ought to take all Opportunities of hearing Sermons.</P>
<P>That there have always been particular Per|&s;ons &s;et apart by GOD to in&s;truct and exhort his People to practice what he &s;hould require of them, is evident from many Pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture.&mdash;St. Jude tells us, that Enoch the &s;eventh from Adam prophe&s;ied, or preached, concerning the LORD's coming with ten Thou&s;and of his Saints to Judgment. And Noah, who lived not long after, is &s;tiled by St. Peter, <HI>a Preacher of Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> And though in all the intermediate Space between the Flood and Giving of the Law, we hear but of few Preachers, yet we may rea&s;onably conclude, that GOD never left him&s;elf with|out Witne&s;s, but at &s;undry Times, and after divers Manners, &s;poke to our Fathers by the Patriarchs and Prophets.</P>
<P>But however it was before, we are a&s;&s;ured that after the Delivery of the Law, GOD has con&s;tantly &s;eparated to him&s;elf a certain Order of Men to preach to, as well as pray for his People; and commanded them to enquire their Duty at the Prie&s;ts Mouths. And tho' the Jews were frequently led into Captivity, and for their Sins &s;cattered abroad through the Face of the Earth, yet he never utterly for&s;ook his Church, but &s;till kept up a Rem|nant of Prophets and Preachers, as Ezekiel,
<PB N="5" REF="025033_0005_0FCD841535152838">
Jeremiah, Daniel, and others, to reprove, in|&s;truct, and call them to Repentance.</P>
<P>Thus was it under the Law. Nor has the Church been wor&s;e, but infinitely better pro|vided for under the Go&s;pel: For when JESUS CHRIST, that great High Prie&s;t, had through the Eternal Spirit offered him&s;elf as a full, perfect, &s;ufficient Sacrifice, Oblation and Sa|tisfaction for the Sins of the whole World, and after his Re&s;urrection had all Power com|mitted to him both in Heaven and Earth, he gave Commi&s;&s;ion to his Apo&s;tles, and in them to all &s;ucceeding Mini&s;ters, to go and preach his Go&s;pel to every Creature; promi&s;ing to be with them to guide, a&s;&s;i&s;t, &s;trengthen and com|fort them <HI>always, even to the End of the World.</HI></P>
<P>But if it be the Duty of Mini&s;ters to preach (and woe be to them if they do not preach the Go&s;pel, for a Nece&s;&s;ity is laid upon them) no doubt, the People are obliged to attend to them; for otherwi&s;e, wherefore are Mini&s;ters &s;ent?</P>
<P>And how can we here avoid admiring the Love and the tender Care which our dear Re|deemer has expre&s;&s;ed for his Spou&s;e the Church? Who, becau&s;e he could not be al|ways with us in Per&s;on, on account it was ex|pedient he &s;hould go away, and as our Fore|runner take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that Glory he had purcha&s;ed by his precious Blood, yet would not leave us comfortle&s;s, but fir&s;t &s;ettled a &s;uf|ficient Number of Pa&s;tors and Teachers; and afterward according to his Promi&s;e, actually did and will continue to &s;end down the Holy Gho&s;t to furni&s;h them and their Succe&s;&s;ors with proper Gifts and Graces for the Work
<PB N="6" REF="025033_0006_0FCD841A9B3A61F8">
of the Min&s;try, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the edifying of his Body in Love, till we all come in the Unity of the Spirit, to the Fulne&s;s of the Mea&s;ure of the Stature of CHRIST.</P>
<P>Oh! how in&s;en&s;ible are tho&s;e of this un|&s;peakable Gift who do de&s;pite to the Spirit of Grace, who crucify the Son of GOD afre&s;h, and put him to an open Shame, by wilfully refu&s;ing to attend &s;o great a Means of their Salvation? How dreadful will the End of &s;uch Men be? How aggravating, that Light &s;hould come into the World, that the glad Tidings of Salvation &s;hould be &s;o very frequently pro|claimed in this City, and that &s;o many &s;hould loath this &s;piritual Manna, his Angels rood, and call it light bread? How much more to|lerable will it be for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">yre and S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on, for So|dom and Gomorrah, than for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uch Sinners? For better, Men had never heard of a Savi|our's b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing born, than after they have heard, not to give heed to the Mini&s;try of tho&s;e, who are employ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, as his Amba&s;&s;adors, to tran&s;act Affairs between GOD and their Souls.</P>
<P>We may, though at a Di&s;tance, without a Spirit of Prophe&s;y, foretel the deplorable Con|dition of &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h Men; and behold them ca&s;t into Hell, lifting up their Eyes, being in Tor|ment, and crying out, How often would our Mini&s;ters have <HI>gathered</HI> us, <HI>as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her Wings!&mdash;But we would not.&mdash;Oh that we had known in that our Day, the Thing that belonged to our everla&s;ting Peace! &mdash;But now they are for ever hid from our Eyes.</HI></P>
<P>Thus wretched, thus inconceivably mi&s;e|rable, will &s;uch be as &s;light and make a mock

at the public Preaching <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f the Go&s;pel.&mdash;But taking it for granted, there are b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t few, if any of this unhappy Stamp, who think it not worth their while to tre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d the Courts of the LORD's Hou&s;e, I pa&s;s on now to the</P>
<P>II. SECOND general Thing propo&s;ed,&mdash;To lay down &s;ome Cautions and Directions, in order to your hearing Sermons with Profit and Advantage.</P>
<P>And here, if we reflect on what has been al|ready delivered, and con&s;ider that Preaching is an Ordinance of GOD, a Means appointed by JESUS CHRIST him&s;elf, for promoting his Kingdom among&s;t Men, you cannot rea&s;ona|bly be offended, if, in order that you may hear Sermons with Profit and Advantage, I</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> direct or intreat you to come to hear them, not out of Curio&s;ity, but from a &s;incere De&s;ire to know and do your Duty.</P>
<P>For<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ality and Hypocri&s;y in any religious Exerci&s;e is an Abomination unto the LORD. And to enter his Hou&s;e merely to have our Ears entertained, and not our Hearts reform|ed, mu&s;t certainly be highly di&s;plea&s;ing to the Mo&s;t High GOD, as well as unprofitable to our&s;elves.</P>
<P>Hence it is, that &s;o many remain Uncon|verted, yea, unaffected with the mo&s;t Evan|gelical Preaching; &s;o that like St. Paul's Companions, they only hear the Preacher's Voice with their outward Ears, but do not experience the Power of it inwardly in their Hearts. Or like the Ground near Gideon's Fleece, they remain untouched, whil&s;t others
<PB N="8" REF="025033_0008_0FCD842009796E28">
that came to be fed with the &s;incere Milk of the Word, like the Fleece it&s;elf, are watered by the Dew of GOD's Heavenly Ble&s;&s;ing, and grow thereby.</P>
<P>Flee therefore, my Brethren, flee Curio&s;ity; and prepare your Hearts by a humble Di&s;po|&s;ition to receive with Meekne&s;s the engrafted Word, and then it will be a Means, under GOD, to quicken, build up, purify, and &s;ave your Souls.</P>
<P>A <HI>Second</HI> Direction I &s;hall lay down for the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, is, not only to prepare your Hearts, before you hear, but al&s;o to give diligent heed to the Things that are &s;poken, whil&s;t you are hearing the Word of GOD.</P>
<P>If an earthly King was to i&s;&s;ue out a Royal Proclamation, on performing or not perform|ing the Conditions wherein contained, the Life or Death of his Subjects entirely depended, how &s;olicitous would they be to hear what tho&s;e Conditions were? And &s;hall not we pay the &s;ame Re&s;pect to the KING of KINGS, and LORD of LORDS, and lend an attentive Ear to his Amba&s;&s;adors, when they are decla|ring in his Name on what Terms our Pardon, Peace, and Happine&s;s may be &s;ecured?</P>
<P>When GOD de&s;cended <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n Mount Sinai in terrible Maje&s;ty, to give unto his People the Law, how attentive were they to his Servant Mo&s;es? And if they were &s;o earne&s;t to hear the Thundrings or Threatnings of the Law, &s;hall not we be as &s;olicitous to hear from the Mini&s;ters of CHRIST, the glad Tidings of the Go&s;pel?</P>
<P>In particular, take heed therefore how you hear the Redeemer's calls. See Luke 11.9. <HI>A&s;k
<PB N="9" REF="025033_0009_0FCD8421ACCD19D8">
and it &s;hall be given you.</HI> It is not do this or that, or the other duty, and it &s;hall be given you, but a&s;k, and it &s;hall be given you. Your duties are what you owe to GOD, and they are his right; if you &s;hould take the goods of a neighbour, to purcha&s;e any thing of him, it would be no better than &s;tealing. See what our Saviour &s;ays, John 10.1. <HI>Verily, verily, I &s;ay unto you, he that entereth not by the door into the &s;heep-fold, but climbeth up &s;ome other way, the &s;ame is a thief and a robber.</HI></P>
<P>But to neglect doing duties, is the way to provoke the Mo&s;t High.</P>
<P>The next words are, <HI>&s;eek and ye &s;hall find.</HI> The word &s;eek implies a great earne&s;tne&s;s to find &s;ome valuable thing that is lo&s;t, or &s;ome|thing of great value or importance, and what can be of greater importance than the re&s;to|ration of a dead &s;oul to life. Remember the importunate widow, how by her importunity &s;he obtained the re&s;toration of her daughter. <HI>Knock, and it &s;hall be opened unto you.</HI> When any per&s;on &s;ees what is in his own heart, he &s;ees his nature is depraved; but let no one, even in his heart, charge GOD with a fault in that matter, whether his &s;hallow rea&s;on can comprehend it or not. Therefore, to be re|newed in the &s;pirit of your minds, it is the gift of GOD."</P>
<P>Whil&s;t CHRIST was him&s;elf on Earth, it is &s;aid, that people hung upon him to hear the gracious Words that proceeded out of his Mouth. And if we looked on Mini&s;ters as we ought, as the repre&s;entatives of JESUS CHRIST, we &s;hould hang upon them to hear their Words al&s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="025033_0010_0FCD8422D1175DC0">Be&s;ides the &s;acred Truths that Go&s;pel Min|i&s;ters deliver are not dry in&s;ipid Lectures on Moral Philo&s;ophy, intended only to amu&s;e us for a while; but the great My&s;teries of Godli|ne&s;s, which therefore we are bound &s;tudiou&s;ly to li&s;ten to, le&s;t through our Negligence we &s;hould either not under&s;tand them, or by any other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> let them &s;lip.</P>
<P>But how regardle&s;s are tho&s;e of this Direc|tion, who in&s;tead of hanging on the Preacher to hear him, doze or &s;leep whil&s;t he is &s;peak|ing to them from God? Unhappy Men! Can they not watch with our ble&s;&s;ed LORD one Hour? What; Have they never read how <HI>Eutichus</HI> fell down as he was &s;leeping, when St. <HI>Paul</HI> continued his di&s;cour&s;e till Midnight, and was taken up dead?</P>
<P>But to return. Though you may prepare your Hearts, as you may think, by a teacha|ble Di&s;po&s;ition, and be attentive whil&s;t di&s;|cour&s;es are delivering, yet this will profit you little, unle&s;s you ob&s;erve a</P>
<P><HI>Third</HI> Direction,&mdash;not to entertain any the lea&s;t Prejudice again&s;t the Mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>For could a Preacher &s;peak with the Tongue of Men and Angels, if his Audience was prejudiced again&s;t him, he would be but as a &s;ounding Bra&s;s, or a tinkling Cymbal.</P>
<P>That was the Rea&s;on why JESUS CHRIST him&s;elf, the eternal Word, could not do ma|ny mighty Works, nor preach to any great Effect among tho&s;e of his own Country; for they were offended at him. And was this &s;ame JESUS, this GOD incarnate again to bow the Heavens, and to come down &s;peaking as never Man &s;poke; yet if we were prejudiced
<PB N="11" REF="025033_0011_0FCD8425E1845668">
again&s;t him, as the <HI>Jews</HI> were, we &s;hould har|den our hearts as the <HI>Jews</HI> did theirs.</P>
<P>But, <HI>Fourthly,</HI> as you ought not to be preju|diced again&s;t, &s;o you &s;hould be careful not to depend too much on a Preacher, or think more highly of him than you ought to think. For though this be an Extreme that People &s;eldom run into; yet preferring one godly Teacher, in Oppo&s;ition to another, has often been of ill Con&s;equence to the church of GOD.</P>
<P>That, we read, was a Fault which the great Apo&s;tle of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> condemned in the <HI>Cor|inthians:</HI> For whereas one &s;aid, I am of <HI>Paul</HI>; another I am of <HI>Apollos:</HI> Are ye not Carnal, &s;ays he? For who is <HI>Paul</HI> and who is <HI>Apollos,</HI> but In&s;truments in GOD's Hand by whom you believed? And are not all godly Mini&s;|ters &s;ent forth to be mini&s;tring Amba&s;&s;adors to tho&s;e who &s;hall be Heirs of Salvation? And are they not all therefore greatly to be e&s;teemed for their Work's Sake.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle, it is true, commands us to pay double Honour to tho&s;e who labour in the Word and Doctrine. But then to perfer one truly pious Mini&s;ter at the Expence of the Character of another, is earthly, &s;en&s;u|al, devili&s;h.</P>
<P>Not to mention that Popularity and Ap|plau&s;e cannot but be exceeding dangerous e|ven to a rightly informed Mind; and mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily fill any thinking Man with a holy Jealou&s;y, le&s;t he &s;hould take that honour to him&s;elf, which is due only to GOD; who a|lone qualifies him for his Mini&s;terial Labours,
<PB N="12" REF="025033_0012_0FCD84276F051048">
and from whom alone every good and perfect Gift cometh.</P>
<P>A <HI>Fifth</HI> Direction I would recommend is, to make a particular Application of every Thing that is delivered, to your own Hearts.</P>
<P>When our Saviour was di&s;cour&s;ing at his la&s;t Supper with his beloved Di&s;ciples, and foretold that one of them &s;hould betray him, each of them immediately applied it to his own Heart and &s;aid, <HI>LORD, Is it I</HI>? And would Per&s;ons in like Manner, when Preach|ers are di&s;&s;uading from any Vice, or per&s;uad|ing to any Virtue, in&s;tead of crying, this w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> de&s;igned again&s;t &s;uch and &s;uch a one, turn their Thoughts inwardly, and &s;ay&mdash;<HI>LORD, Is it I?</HI> How far more beneficial &s;hould we find Di&s;cour&s;es to be, than they generally are now?</P>
<P>But we are apt to wander too much abroad: Always looking at the Mote which is in our Neighbour's Eye, rather than the Beam which is in our own.</P>
<P>Ha&s;te we now to the <HI>Sixth</HI> and la&s;t Direct|ion: If you would receive a Ble&s;&s;ing from the LORD, when you hear his Word preach|ed, pray to him, both before, in, and after every Sermon, to endue the Mini&s;ter with Power to &s;peak, and to grant you a Will and Ability to put in Practice what he &s;hall &s;hew from the Book of GOD to be your Duty.</P>
<P>This would be an excellent Means to ren|der the Word preached effectual to the en|lightning and enflaming your Hearts, and without this all the other Means before pre|&s;cribed will be in vain. No doubt it was this Con&s;ideration that made St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;o earne&s;tly
<PB N="13" REF="025033_0013_0FCD842B38ACA6D8">
intreat his beloved <HI>Ephe&s;ians</HI> to intercede with GOD for him,&mdash;<HI>Praying always,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>with all Manner of Prayer and Supplication in the Spirit; and for me al&s;o, that I may open my Mouth with Boldne&s;s, to make known the mi&s;|teries of the Go&s;pel.</HI> And if &s;o great an Apo|&s;tle as <HI>Paul,</HI> needed the Prayers of his People, much more do tho&s;e Mini&s;ters who have only the ordinary Gifts of the Holy Spirit.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, this would be a good Proof that you &s;incerely de&s;ired to do as well as know the Will of GOD: And it mu&s;t highly profit both Mini&s;ters and people; becau&s;e GOD through your Prayers will give them a double Portion of his Holy Spirit, whereby they will be enabled to in&s;truct you more fully in the Things which pertain to the Kingdom of GOD.</P>
<P>And oh, that all that hear me this Day, would &s;eriou&s;ly apply their Hearts to practi&s;e what has now been told them!&mdash;How would Mini&s;ters &s;ee Satan like Lightning fall from Heaven, and People find the Word preached &s;harper than a two-edged Sword, and mighty through GOD to the pulling down of the Devil's &s;trong Holds!</P>
<P>The Holy Gho&s;t would then fall on all them that heard the Word; as when St. <HI>Peter</HI> preached. The Go&s;pel of CHRIST would have free Cour&s;e, run very &s;wiftly, and Thou|&s;ands again be converted by a Sermon.</P>
<P>For JESUS CHRIST is the &s;ame Ye&s;ter|day, to Day, and for ever. His all-powerful Hand is not &s;hortened. He has promi&s;ed to be with his Mini&s;ters always, even unto the End of the World.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="025033_0014_0FCD842C78228F48">It does indeed &s;ometimes happen that GOD to magnify his Free Grace in CHRIST JESUS, is found of them that &s;ought him not; a notorious Sinner is forcibly work|ed upon by a publick Sermon, and plucked as a Fire-brand out of the Fire. But this is not GOD's ordinary Way of acting. No; for the Generality, he only vi&s;its tho&s;e with the Pow|er of his Word who humbly wait to know what he would have them to do. And &s;ends unqualified Hearers not only empty, but har|dened, away.</P>
<P>Take heed, therefore, ye carele&s;s curious Profe&s;&s;ors, if any &s;uch be here pre&s;ent, how you hear. Remember that, whether we think of it or not, we mu&s;t all appear before the Judgment Seat of CHRIST, where Mini&s;ters mu&s;t give a &s;trict Acco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt of the Doctrine they have delivered, and you as &s;trict a one, how you have impro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed und<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r it. And good GOD! how will you be able to &s;tand at the Bar of an angry, Sin avenging Judge, and &s;ee &s;o many Di&s;cour&s;es you have de&s;pi&s;ed, &s;o many Mini&s;ters who once longed and laboured for the Salvation of your precious and mortal Souls, brought out as &s;o many &s;wift Witne&s;&s;|es again&s;t you? Will it be &s;ufficient then think you, to alledge that you went to hear them only out of curio&s;ity, to pa&s;s away an idle Hour, to admire the Oratory, or ridi|cule the &s;implicity of the preacher? No, GOD will then let you know, that you ought to have come out of better Principles, that every Sermon has been put down to your account, and that you mu&s;t then be ju&s;tly puni&s;hed for not improving by them.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="025033_0015_0FCDAA330E1ECAB8">But fear not, you little Flock, who with Meekne&s;s receive the ingrafted Word, and bring forth the peaceable Fruits of Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s; for it &s;hall not be &s;o with you. No; you will be your Mini&s;ter's Joy, and their Crown of Rejoicing in the Day of our Lord JESUS. And they will pre&s;ent you in a ho|ly Triumph faultle&s;s and unblameable to our common Redeemer, &s;aying, Behold us, O LORD, and the Children which Thou ha&s;t given us.</P>
<P>But &s;till <HI>take you heed how you hear.</HI> For upon your improving the Grace you have, more &s;hall be given, and you &s;hall have abun|dance. For He is faithful that has promi&s;ed. Who al&s;o will do it. Nay, GOD from out of <HI>Sion</HI> &s;hall &s;o ble&s;s you, that every Sermon you hear &s;hall communicate to you a fre&s;h Supply of Spiritual Knowledge. The Word of GOD &s;hall dwell in you richly; you &s;hall go on from Strength to Strength, from one Degree of Grace unto another, till being grown up to be perfect Men in CHRIST JESUS, and filled with all Fulne&s;s of GOD, you &s;hall be tran&s;lated by Death to &s;ee him as he is, and to &s;ing Prai&s;e before the Throne with Angels and Archangels, Cherubims and Seraphims, and the general A&s;&s;embly of the Fir&s;t-born, who&s;e Names are written in Hea|ven for ever and ever.</P>
