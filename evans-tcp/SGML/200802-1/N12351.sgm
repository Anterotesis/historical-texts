<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Work which I offer to the Public, being of an extraordinary kind for a woman's pen, it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay what gave occa&s;ion to it.</P>
<P>About two years &s;ince, having a conver&s;ation with a clergyman of my acquaintance concern|ing preaching in general, he, betwixt je&s;t and earne&s;t, declared he would preach any &s;ermon which I would write. An agreement was made, and I &s;at down to compo&s;e.</P>
<P>As I had always looked on per&s;ons of a covetous di&s;po&s;ition with a mixture of pity and indignation, and having met with many of a contracted, narrow turn of mind, and very few who an&s;wered my idea of genero&s;ity, the text which had occurred on &s;everal occa&s;ions, when I could have wi&s;hed not to have had rea&s;on for it, pre&s;ented it&s;elf now, and I pitched on that as a &s;ubject on which I might expre&s;s my thoughts.</P>
<P>Some accidental circum&s;tances prevented its being preached: but having once entered on
<PB N="6" REF="015584_0005_0F998EE35C838B98">
that kind of writing, I could not help commit|ting to paper &s;ome thoughts which had fre|quently pa&s;&s;ed over my mind on the in&s;ufficiency of this life for real happine&s;s, and the uncer|tainty of all that wore that appearance. On this occa&s;ion I expatiated on the words of Job; a book which I had always read with admira|tion and melancholy plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The Sermon on Revenge is compo&s;ed of arguments which I had often made u&s;e of to calm the &s;pirit of retaliation, which I have found ri&s;ing in my brea&s;t, on my having met with unkind treatment where I thought I had not de&s;erved, and had no rea&s;on to expect it.</P>
<P>The&s;e three di&s;cour&s;es lay by me a long while without my thinking much about them; till having mentioned to a friend a de&s;ire I had of turning to &s;ome public advantage what I had written, he told me the thought was not ami&s;s, but they were too few to publi&s;h alone, and advi&s;ed me to write four more.</P>
<P>I cho&s;e tho&s;e &s;ubjects on which I had mo&s;t reflected, and on which therefore I had mo&s;t to &s;ay. The terrible con&s;equences of Slander to defencele&s;s Women, and the extreme cruelty of
<PB N="7" REF="015584_0006_0F998EE42C02C110">
the practice again&s;t tho&s;e, who generally labour under evils &s;ufficient to embitter life without that addition, had often employed my thoughts; and the equitable admonition of Our Saviour, delivered in that admirable &s;ermon which con|tained the mo&s;t perfect rule of life that ever was given to man, appeared to me a proper text, and therefore con&s;tituted the &s;ubject of the fourth e&s;&s;ay.</P>
<P>As the u&s;ual con&s;equence of having my &s;pirits too much rai&s;ed has been the feeling them al&s;o too greatly depre&s;&s;ed, I had often, on tho&s;e occa&s;ions, quoted to my&s;elf the words of Solomon, which I have now fixed on as a topic for the fifth e&s;&s;ay. I have always entertained the highe&s;t notion of filial duty, which I think is lately grown too little the fa&s;hion; and this furni&s;hes me with matter for another. The &s;eventh was the hint of a friend, who is her&s;elf a mother, and who&s;e partiality to my judgment made her de&s;irous to know if my opinion coincided with her own in the article of education.</P>
<P>I hope this account will prevent my being accu&s;ed of vanity in endeavouring to reform mankind. I really never had &s;uch a thought: but if I can be at all beneficial to that part of it
<PB N="8" REF="015584_0007_0F998EE4E72339E0">
to which I belong, among whom there are &s;ome who will not di&s;dain to take advice from a female writer, I &s;hall e&s;teem my&s;elf happy to be able to conduce to their amu&s;ement or improve|ment. The very young, who&s;e minds are not yet formed, and who are &s;tartled at the idea of reading a &s;ermon, may, through the novelty of the&s;e, be induced to peru&s;e, and may po&s;&s;ibly learn &s;ome u&s;eful le&s;&s;ons from them.</P>
<P>As a farther apology, let me ob&s;erve that political di&s;putes now employ the tongues and pens of almo&s;t all degrees of men, as well clergy as laity, &s;o that they have no time to think of any thing el&s;e. The rage of public virtue is &s;o great, that private virtue is almo&s;t forgotten. When patrioti&s;m and royali&s;m engage all the wits of the age, it is no wonder that a Woman &s;hould take the lower department, and venture to write moral e&s;&s;ays. The candid will remember that it is the work of a Woman, and will not be very &s;evere in their critici&s;m; the cen&s;ure of others I am not &s;olicitous to de|precate, as I think too highly of the Public to &s;uppo&s;e it can influence their judgment.</P>

<HEAD>AGAINST COVETOUSNESS.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>MATTHEW. xix. 24.</BIBL>
<Q>I &s;ay unto you, it is ea&s;ier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of Heaven.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS is a hard &s;aying, and might well give occa&s;ion to the que&s;tion put to our Saviour, by his di&s;ciples, of, Who then can be &s;aved? However, if we examine a little farther, I think I &s;hall prove that no impo&s;&s;ibility is im|plied by the&s;e words: in order to this, let us recollect to whom, and on what account, they were &s;poken. A young gentleman of large fortune, who had been a &s;trict ob&s;erver of the Jewi&s;h law, who was con&s;cious of having di&s;|charged him&s;elf ju&s;tly in his dealings with man|kind, indeed, one who does not &s;eem to have been deficient in any point of moral duty, yet found &s;omething wanting in him&s;elf, and was &s;en&s;ible he had done nothing which could in|&s;ure him eternal life. Under this conviction he applied to our Saviour, hoping he might
<PB N="10" REF="015584_0009_0F998EE658C7B448">
find &s;omething in the new religion which might &s;et his mind at re&s;t with regard to a future &s;tate; flattering him&s;elf, perhaps, that the compliance with a few external ceremonies would &s;ecure him everla&s;ting felicity: but how thunder&s;truck was he, when the Great Founder of our faith demanded the &s;urrender of all his goods to the poor, and promi&s;ed him trea&s;ure in heaven, on no other terms than the parting with what he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed on earth. But here it may be a&s;ked, If the rich man could not have been a worthy member of Chri&s;tianity without &s;o great a &s;acri|fice? To which I an&s;wer, that in tho&s;e early times I think &s;uch a &s;acrifice was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary: our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour con&s;tantly taught his di&s;ciples a contempt for all &s;ublunary riches and honours; he often repeated to them that his kingdom was not of this world: that if they would be his di&s;ciples indeed, they mu&s;t &s;ubmit to poverty and di&s;grace; mu&s;t be &s;trangers and pilgrims on earth, as became the followers of a ma&s;ter who had no place to lay his head, and who was &s;o poor as not to be able to pay the tri|bute due unto Cae&s;ar without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a miracle. Our Lord knew the oppo&s;ition a doc|&s;o contrary to worldly wi&s;dom mu&s;t naturally meet with: he knew that the propagators of it
<PB N="11" REF="015584_0010_0F998EEA916B03D0">
would be afflicted, tormented, per&s;ecuted, and even &s;uffer death for his name's &s;ake: "Think not, &s;ays he, I am come to &s;end peace on earth, I am come to &s;end a &s;word;" for that he knew would be the con&s;equence of man's perver&s;ene&s;s and di&s;obedience. It was incumbent then on men who were to be &s;ubject to the cruelty and malice of the world; who were to &s;it loo&s;e to all earthly enjoyments, and to be ready to lay down their lives, whenever they were called for, rather than renounce their faith; to have their minds di&s;engaged from all lower concerns, and and their hearts fixed upon an incorruptible trea&s;ure, which it was not in the power of any earthly potentate either to de&s;troy or dimini&s;h.</P>
<P>Thus much is, I think, &s;ufficient to prove, that it mu&s;t have been a great impediment to the progre&s;s of the go&s;pel, if the fir&s;t preacher of it had been wealthy: be&s;ides which, it is not unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that the Son of God, the Great &s;earcher of hearts, plainly &s;aw that this young man's was too contracted to enter|tain the exten&s;ive benevolence, and unbounded liberality, which are the great principles of the chri&s;tian in&s;titution, and without which religion is no more than a name: he was &s;trictly ju&s;t;
<PB N="12" REF="015584_0011_0F998EEBE34D8190">
but what merit could he claim from that? born, as he was, to large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, what temptation had he to injure his neighbour either by vio|lence or fraud? That there are oppre&s;&s;ive rich ones I confe&s;s; but they are &s;o far from de&s;erv|ing the title of Chri&s;tians, that they are not worthy of that of men, but may be ju&s;tly looked on as infernal &s;pirits in human &s;hape, who are &s;uffered for a time to indulge their evil inclina|tions, by being the pe&s;ts of &s;ociety; but it is to be hoped &s;uch characters are very &s;carce.</P>
<P>The generality of the world think they have di&s;charged their duty towards their neighbour, if they have never invaded another's property, and look upon it they have an undoubted right to keep what they call their own by inheritance or acqui&s;ition to their own u&s;e. Unhappy de|lu&s;ion! fatal error! produced by the love of gold; the man who inherits an affluent fortune, while he &s;ees multitudes around him pining in want of the nece&s;&s;aries of life, for multitudes &s;uch he mu&s;t &s;ee (unle&s;s he wilfully &s;huts his eyes) ought to look up to heaven with the ut|mo&s;t gratitude, who has not only placed him above the mi&s;eries of dependance, and re|ceiving obligations, which are too often confer|red
<PB N="13" REF="015584_0012_0F998EED863372B8">
in &s;uch a manner as to fill the feeling mind with the keene&s;t angui&s;h, though hard nece&s;&s;ity compels the acceptance; but, in&s;tead of the painful ta&s;k of receiving, a&s;&s;igns to him the plea&s;ing one of b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;towing and imitating his great Creator in the only thing by which he can become like him, that of being a father to the fatherle&s;s, and wiping away the tear of com|plaint from the afflicted widow's eye: but if, like Dives in the parable, his flinty heart is not to be &s;oftened by the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of others, let &s;elf love at lea&s;t prevail on him to act as if it were &s;o; let him remember with dread that exclamation of our Saviour's, "How hardly &s;hall riches enter the kingdom of heaven:" and let him not &s;uffer that wealth which, properly u&s;ed, might be his pa&s;&s;port to a bli&s;sful eternity, to be an everla&s;ting bar again&s;t his entrance: but there are &s;ome men who de&s;ire to compro|mi&s;e the matter; and, provided they be allowed to hoard their trea&s;ure, or &s;pend it in &s;elfi&s;h gra|tifications while they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ive, would be willing at their deaths to make ample amends, by leaving a large portion of what they can no longer en|joy to &s;ome public charity: by this pretence they look on them&s;elves as excu&s;ed from every act of benevolence during life; but at the hour
<PB N="14" REF="015584_0013_0F998EEEC16D7698">
of death their awakened con&s;ciences never fail to tell them how mi&s;erably they have been deceiv|ed; and they wi&s;h, though then, alas! &s;uch wi&s;hes are in vain, that they had &s;ome few deeds of real charity to cover their many faults, and plead for them at the throne of mercy.</P>
<P>Men of acquired fortunes have generally very plau&s;ible rea&s;ons for not being generous: we have earned our money with the &s;weat of our brows, &s;ay they, &s;urely we have a right to enjoy it likewi&s;e; the indu&s;trious never fail of &s;ucce&s;s, and indolence is the only parent of want. Tho' this may be often true, yet it is far from being a general rule: let the pro&s;perous man abate a little of his &s;elf-&s;ufficiency, and recollect, and he will find that his &s;ucce&s;s has not been owing merely to his own indu&s;try, but has generally been aided by &s;ome lucky chance; &s;ome kind a&s;&s;i&s;ting friends, guided by providence, has led him forward, which others of equal merit have not been able to find; let him not then arrogate too much to him&s;elf, nor too &s;everely cen&s;ure the le&s;s fortunate, or always charge their ill fortune to their ill con|duct, but rather let him, as becomes a man and a Chri&s;tian, endeavour to alleviate the di&s;tre&s;&s;es
<PB N="15" REF="015584_0014_0F998EEF678F6548">
which the unkindne&s;s of the world; joined to their own errors, may have brought upon them, to a&s;&s;i&s;t them with his advice, his intere&s;t, or his pur&s;e, as occa&s;ion requires; and rai&s;e to cheerful indu&s;try, by the pro&s;pect of reward, the mind which frequent di&s;appointment has &s;unk to inactivity and dejection.</P>
<P>It is to be lamented that per&s;ons of high rank, who&s;e fortunes enable them to relieve the poor and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, are &s;o far removed above want them&s;elves, and &s;o little accu&s;tomed to the &s;ee|ing it in others, that they &s;eldom think of or feel for it properly; while the man of liberal heart and narrow circum&s;tances is often wound|ed by &s;ights of woe, which, as it is utterly out of his power to alleviate by any thing more than a pitying tear, &s;erves only to give unnece&s;|&s;ary pain, and make him regret the want of ability to do that which, perhaps, had provi|dence ble&s;&s;ed him with, he might have neglect|ed; &s;o &s;eldom do riches and liberality meet. It is true, there is a kind of fa&s;hionable charity &s;ub&s;i&s;ting among us, and it is no uncommon thing to hear that a certain noble per&s;onage has ordered a certain &s;um of money to be laid out in provi&s;ions, and di&s;tributed among the poor:&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="015584_0015_0F998EF01CAE1A20">
This is generally mentioned with great enco|miums in the news-papers as a laudable example for others to follow: That it is truly laudable to provide for the nece&s;&s;ities of the indu&s;trious la|bourer, far be it from me to deny; but there are a &s;et of unhappy people, who&s;e lot is ca&s;t above the lowe&s;t &s;ort, and yet want the comforts which even they enjoy. A&s;hamed to beg, un|able to dig, the&s;e I recommend as proper ob|jects for the rich to exerci&s;e their genero&s;ity on: let them &s;eek them in their ob&s;curity, and they will find families whom they may make happy by &s;ums &s;o incon&s;iderable as by them&s;elves to be &s;carcely mi&s;&s;ed; they will there find worthy people have been reduced to poverty by unavoid|able and unfore&s;een misfortunes, and unable to bear up again&s;t them for want of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of friends and money; &s;ome who have owed their ruin to their own goodne&s;s of heart, who&s;e ge|nerous, un&s;u&s;pecting natures have been impo&s;ed upon by artful and de&s;igning men; &s;uch as the&s;e who have erred through exce&s;s of virtue, have certainly a claim which no liberal mind can refu&s;e; and many may be likewi&s;e found who&s;e &s;ufferings have been owing to their own follies; yet &s;ufferings &s;till they are, and they who feel the weight of them have a right to
<PB N="17" REF="015584_0016_0F998EF0DDB796F8">
pity and relief from creatures who are not them&s;elves exempt from the failings of huma|nity. Indeed, I know not how to believe there are any people &s;o void of tenderne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion, as to upbraid a man for indi&s;cre|tions, at the time he is feeling their dreadful con&s;equences. Can there be a more pitiable object, than the father of a family who &s;ees his children around him de&s;titute of &s;upport, and mu&s;t reproach him&s;elf as the cau&s;e? and can there be a greater act of genero&s;ity than to alleviate &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s, by putting it in his power to retrieve pa&s;t errors, and provide for the innocent &s;harers of his condition?</P>
<P>May the Almighty Di&s;po&s;er of all events in|cline the hearts of all who abound in this world's wealth to &s;uch true benevolence; the reflections on &s;uch actions will give comfort at the hour of death, when all worldly riches &s;hall cea&s;e to afford any: and our Ble&s;&s;ed Sa|viour has plainly told us, that feeding the hun|gry, clothing the naked, vi&s;iting the &s;ick, comforting the afflicted, are the only works that &s;hall &s;tand us in any &s;tead at the great day of judgment.

<HEAD>ON THE VANITY OF THIS LIFE.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>JOB xix. 26.</BIBL>
<Q>For though after this life worms de&s;troy this body, yet in my fle&s;h &s;hall I &s;ee God.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE were the words of Job at a time when he &s;eems to have lo&s;t all hopes of earthly happine&s;s, and to have fixed his thoughts only on &s;omething beyond the grave, as appears from many pa&s;&s;ages in the foregoing chapters; where he, in the mo&s;t pathetic terms, laments his forlorn condition. "My face is foul with weeping, &s;aith he; my eye al&s;o, by rea&s;on of my &s;orrow, is dim; and on my eyelids is the &s;hadow of death."</P>
<P>He then enumerates his uncommon misfor|tunes, till too much di&s;pirited with the &s;ad re|collection to plead any longer again&s;t the unju&s;t reproaches of his friends, he implores their pity, in &s;uch a moving though &s;hort &s;entence, that had they not been the mo&s;t unfeeling of
<PB N="20" REF="015584_0018_0F998EF2721D5C68">
men, they would have cea&s;ed to per&s;ecute him who &s;eemed already but too &s;en&s;ible of having, though he knew not for what cau&s;e, fallen under the di&s;plea&s;ure of the Almighty.</P>

Surely, if ever any man had rea&s;on to think his happine&s;s fixed on a certain duration, it was Job, who was born to a princely fortune, of con&s;equence &s;ufficient to be courted by the nobles of the land, who con&s;ulted him as their oracle, and hung with &s;ilent admiration and re&s;pect on the eloquence of his words. The mul|titude, who&s;e wants his bounteous hand &s;upplied, followed him as he pa&s;&s;ed; every tongue ble&s;&s;ed him, and every eye melting with gratitude, expre&s;&s;ed the joy which filled the heart.</P>

<P>IT is allowed, even by the greate&s;t enemies of Chri&s;tianity, that there never was any &s;y&s;tem of religion &s;o perfect, &s;o calculated to promote the general good of &s;ociety, as that contained in the go&s;pel: all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in&s;pire love and good-will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> none &s;urely can be more conducive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> happine&s;s than the precept &s;o often and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> po&s;itively enjoined "of the forgivene&s;s of injuries."</P>

us the lowe&s;t and vile&s;t of mankind are capable of attaining. Our minds are naturally led to re&s;ent ill u&s;age; and even the Jews, the people cho&s;en of God, to whom he deigned to reveal his will in a more particular manner than to the re&s;t of the world, were but very imperfect practitioners of this duty of forgive|ne&s;s: nay, we find among&s;t the be&s;t of them &s;ome very unju&s;tifiable in&s;tances of revenge; and the mo&s;t that any one could arrive at was not to return evil for evil: but the Godlike act of returning good for evil, of ble&s;&s;ing our enemy when he cur&s;ed us, of feeding him when hungry, and &s;upplying him with drink when dry, was too great a ma&s;tery over the pa&s;&s;ions for human nature, una&s;&s;i&s;ted, ever to arrive at.</P>
<P>Nor would (I may venture to affirm) the po&s;itive command of God him&s;elf, forbidding revenge, have been &s;ufficient to re&s;train crea|tures &s;o prone to it, had not our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour conde&s;cended &s;o far to our weakne&s;s as to be our companion here on earth, and not only to enjoin this great duty by precept, but was him|&s;elf the mo&s;t perfect pattern of a meek and for|giving &s;pirit that the world ever &s;aw.

What return did an ungrateful and unfeeling world make to &s;uch invaluable favours?</P>
<P>Why, they fed on his bounty, and then forgot the miraculous hand that had be&s;towed it on them: they were healed by his &s;overeign touch, and then, with a &s;trange and unheard of ba&s;ene&s;s, a&s;cribed his power to &s;orcery and enchantment: and at length, to crown all, and to carry their hatred as far as po&s;&s;ible, they &s;eized on their benefactor, their Redeemer, and their God; and, with &s;acrilegious hands, put him to the mo&s;t painful and ignominious death: yet, at the moment that he &s;ubmitted to their unju&s;t decree, boundle&s;s as his power was, when he could in an in&s;tant have com|manded fire from heaven to have de&s;troyed his enemies, he prayed for them to his Father, alleviating their guilt, by imputing it to their ignorance.</P>

<P>In the day of adver&s;ity his mo&s;t intimate friends and followers for&s;ook him and fled; and he, who had been di&s;tingui&s;hed by marks of particular kindne&s;s, and who, but a few hours before, had repeatedly declared he would die with him, denied even the knowledge of him.

<P>It will certainly be allowed that the mo&s;t ju&s;t among us are inclinable to judge well of them&s;elves; and the more merit any one thinks he has, the greater appears the injury that he thinks has been done him; and when his imagination is heated by a &s;en&s;e of wrong, I am afraid he will not be quite equitable in his vengeance. Another rea&s;on again&s;t pur&s;u|ing revenge is, that we do not no where it will &s;top: for the man who could, unprovoked, do us an injury, will certainly not be ju&s;t enough to &s;ubmit to our puni&s;hments, but will take the fir&s;t opportunity of returning it; this will call for a &s;econd revenge: thus we &s;hall be engaged in a &s;tate of continual ho&s;tilities, and, in&s;tead of mutual good offices, our time will be &s;pent in a retaliation of injuries.</P>

It is certainly the intere&s;t of every man to u&s;e his utmo&s;t endeavours to eradicate this turbu|lent unruly pa&s;&s;ion from his brea&s;t: for I know not which to &s;ay is the mo&s;t pitiable object, he who broods over his wrongs, lamenting his want of power to revenge; or he who plea&s;es him&s;elf with the diabolical and &s;hort-lived &s;atis|faction of rendering his enemy as unhappy as him&s;elf: but undoubtedly they may both be &s;aid to carry a hell in their bo&s;om.</P>
<P>I am convinced men would want few per&s;ua|&s;ives to forgivene&s;s, if they righly con&s;idered the imperfection of human nature; how liable we are to mi&s;take the meaning of words; how apt to be impo&s;ed on by a mi&s;repre&s;entation of facts, we may charge that to de&s;ign which was the effect of inadvertency; and our being hurt may be owing perhaps more to the too great nicety of our &s;en&s;ations, than to any real offence we have received.&mdash;But let us take it in the wor&s;t light, and &s;uppo&s;e the blow that has been given to have proceeded from a malignant heart, yet &s;hall we &s;uffer our enemy to triumph over us, by being able to &s;hake our &s;ouls from a &s;teady adherence to Chri&s;tian virtue?

<P>It is true, there are &s;ome ca&s;es in which a man is obliged to vindicate his right, where his for|tune or reputation are injuriou&s;ly attacked. It is &s;o far from being blameable, that it is really commendable to defend them to the utmo&s;t of

"Forgive us our tre&s;pa&s;&s;es as we forgive them who tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t us," is the Chri&s;tian's daily prayer: and it is a mockery of God to offer up petitions on &s;uch terms as we are re&s;olved not to comply with. Let us not deceive our&s;elves, and think that a meer outward form, and words of cour&s;e, will &s;upply the place of that unfeigned cordial forgivene&s;s which Chri&s;t requires as only available for God's pardoning us: "for &s;o like|wi&s;e,

<P>After having vainly &s;ought it among the noi&s;y plea&s;ures of the world, he concludes with a de|claration, "that if it was any where to be found, it was in peaceful joys, and the calm felicity that ari&s;es from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of a well &s;pent life."</P>

<P>How often have we found, after an evening pa&s;t in the utmo&s;t fe&s;tivity, our &s;pirits exhau&s;ted to a great degree, and even &s;till more lowered by a recollection of the la&s;t night's mirth!

<P>But here let it not be under&s;tood that I con|demn as criminal all a&s;&s;emblies met with a de&s;ign of being merry. Recreation is not only de&s;irable, but nece&s;&s;ary: man is a &s;ocial being, and &s;ociety was not de&s;igned as a &s;nare, but a comfort to him. A cheerful freedom of con|ver&s;ation &s;oftens our natures, and prevents our falling into moro&s;ene&s;s. On the other hand, if cheerfulne&s;s degenerates into licentiou&s;ne&s;s, it degrades us below humanity.</P>
<P>There have been, perhaps, in&s;tances of men who have run into extreme riot, which their minds did not approve, merely from a fear of the imputation of ill-nature, and a want of com|plai&s;ance. Good-nature, indeed, I look on as &s;o e&s;&s;ential, that all other virtues without it are of no value: it is the mark of an open generous

<P>Some time too ought to be allowed to the duties of ho&s;pitality, to entertain our friends and neighbours in a manner &s;uited to their rank, and our own; and, upon the whole, we &s;hall find that the gentleman's time may be as fully em|ployed as his, who labours for his living, with this difference only, that God has allotted the former the mo&s;t agreeable way of &s;pending it; and, as the bounty of heaven has exempted &s;uch men from the common cares of life, it is a duty incumbent on them to endeavour to become u&s;eful members of the commonwealth, as ma|gi&s;trates to apportion a part of their time to the di&s;tribution of ju&s;tice, for the puni&s;hment of vice, and the encouragement of virtue.</P>

<P>The term we have to live may generally be called &s;eventy years; and though &s;ome few ex|tend their race beyond that time, much fewer ever arrive at it. However, let us &s;uppo&s;e that to be the &s;tretch of man's life, yet many years mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be lo&s;t in childhood; and the infirmities of age, though not felt equally in all, will undoubtedly deprive us of &s;ome more: add to this, the nece&s;&s;ary portion of hours allotted to the bu&s;ine&s;s of eating, &s;leeping, dre&s;&s;ing, vi&s;iting: the management of our families and fortunes call for their &s;hare of our attention:</P>
<P>And is there none to be dedicated to the &s;er|vice of our God?

<P>But as it is nece&s;&s;ary for the mind of man to be &s;ometimes relaxed and amu&s;ed, I would point out tho&s;e amu&s;ements which appear to be both innocent and agreeable; among which we may reckon painting and mu&s;ic: painting, where people are ble&s;t with a genius, is a de|lightful employment; and mu&s;ic exalts the &s;oul, and rai&s;es it above this world; it in&s;pires the mo&s;t plea&s;ing devotion, and anticipates the plea&s;ures of hereafter.</P>

<P>Among other rational plea&s;ures give me leave to mention one which I cannot look on as the lea&s;t; I mean that which ari&s;es in the mind from the view of beautiful rural &s;cenes: here we may &s;urvey the &s;tupendous works of the great Creator, till we lo&s;e our&s;elves in admira|tion and delight.</P>
<P>This is a plea&s;ure which will never pall; the eye is never tired with gazing on the beauties of nature; &s;till are they &s;een with new wonder; &s;till beheld with fre&s;h delight. On &s;uch occa&s;i|ons the &s;oul is naturally led to adore that Being, who&s;e wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s are &s;o evidently di&s;played before us.

<P>THESE few words carry with them a threat, which it might be imagined would be &s;ufficient to deter any from too &s;everely cen&s;ur|ing the conduct of others. If we would look into our own actions, and truly examine tho&s;e for which we mu&s;t one day be accountable, we &s;hould find very little lei&s;ure, as well as inclina|tion, to in&s;pect tho&s;e of other people.</P>
<P>If our di&s;po&s;ition leads us rather to condemn than approve, we may gratify that propen&s;ity by turning our eyes inward, and not injure another by wounding his reputation. By this means we may make that beneficial to our own &s;ouls, which would otherwi&s;e prove a cur&s;e to them and to &s;ociety.

faults; but tho&s;e who are inclinable to cen&s;ure the failings of others, will rarely err on the favourable &s;ide.</P>
<P>When the cen&s;orious tell a &s;tory which hurts the character of any one, they either &s;kip over or very lightly touch on the circum&s;tances which might incline the hearers to judge candidly, but dwell upon, and, perhaps, too often exag|gerate tho&s;e which &s;hew things in the wor&s;t light.</P>
<P>Slanderers may be divided into two cla&s;&s;es: the fir&s;t are they who&s;e diabolical natures lead them to invent fictions to traduce the character of any to whom they owe a grudge: the &s;econd are tho&s;e who indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread the &s;candal which they have heard from others. From the fir&s;t of the&s;e calumniators what innocence can &s;ecure us? What virtue can defend us from the malice of an enemy who is not re&s;trained by the ties of honour, or checks of con&s;cience? I fear &s;uch wretches are too far gone for any thing I can &s;ay to have an effect upon them; I &s;hall only then de&s;ire tho&s;e who &s;uffer from the unde&s;erved a&s;per&s;ions of the wicked, to comfort them&s;elves with an a&s;&s;urance that truth will at

length triumph over fal&s;ehood, and a con&s;tant per&s;everance in well doing, will be too hard even for malevolence it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The &s;econd &s;ort of &s;landerers which I &s;hall mention, are they who&s;e ears are ever open to &s;candal; who are greedy in hearing, and eager in &s;preading reports: if the things which &s;uch a one relates are not of &s;ome con&s;equence, there will be no plea&s;ure in &s;eeming to know them; this leads him to inflame every word and cir|cum&s;tance; to aggravate what is blameable; to pervert what is not &s;o; and mi&s;repre&s;ent the mo&s;t indifferent actions. I am afraid too many commit this fault, without ever reflecting that they are &s;inning again&s;t their neighbour in the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential point in which they can injure him; that they are robbing him of what is much more precious than all his other po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions: yet this is really the ca&s;e; and what makes the injury &s;till more atrocious is, that it is generally more irreparable than any other.</P>

man who has wounded another's reputation to re&s;tore it whole as before. The evil which has been &s;aid of any one is not ea&s;ily forgotten, but is often remembered to their di&s;advantage long after it has cea&s;ed to be talked of.</P>
<P>It may not be an ob&s;ervation quite unworthy of remark, that tho&s;e people are u&s;ually mo&s;t &s;evere upon the faults of others, who have lea&s;t merit them&s;elves to boa&s;t of; their &s;ouls not capable of ri&s;ing to any emulation, find a &s;atisfaction in levelling the re&s;t of the world to their own pitch: But how ineffectual as well as dete&s;table a method of covering defects is this? It is certain never to &s;ucceed: the defamer is always &s;ure to have a number of &s;pies on his own conduct, who will not fail to expo&s;e to public view the errors of a per&s;on who makes it his bu&s;ine&s;s to point out tho&s;e of others.</P>
<P>If a man would &s;ecure to him&s;elf the good-will of mankind, it mu&s;t be by a quite contrary practice; by at lea&s;t being neuter, and, if he has not good-nature enough to palliate, not ma|liciou&s;ly aggravate faults.

<P>It is &s;ad, but I fear too true, that none are more liable to cen&s;ure than tho&s;e who&s;e great and good qualities might be looked on as a cer|tain defence again&s;t it.

<P>I hope I &s;hall not be under&s;tood here as lay|ing and di&s;couragement in the way of tho&s;e who wi&s;h to pur&s;ue the paths of virtue: for though a good life cannot &s;ilence calumny, it will at length di&s;arm it, by &s;hewing the fal&s;ene&s;s of report. The malicious &s;landerer may, for a time, hurt the good name of another, by injuri|ous &s;candal; but hereafter it will be found that he has done the mo&s;t material injury to him&s;elf, &s;ince the &s;evere judgment which he has pa&s;&s;ed upon others, will undoubtedly be pa&s;&s;ed upon

<P>I will here mention what is &s;eldom taken notice of, but yet is the mo&s;t in&s;idious way of ruining reputation; I mean by commenda|tion.

<P>The cruelty of this practice can hardly be equalled; and, I am &s;orry to &s;ay it, is too &s;uc|ce&s;sfully made u&s;e of again&s;t the mo&s;t weak and defencele&s;s part of the creation; who&s;e charac|ters once &s;ullied can never be wa&s;hed clean by floods of tears, or regained by the mo&s;t faultle&s;s conduct: yet &s;urely I may be pardoned when I &s;ay that, among tho&s;e unhappy females, who by one fal&s;e &s;tep have for ever forfeited any claim to the world's good opion of their pa&s;t or future actions, there are &s;ome who, had they not been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the mo&s;t amiable qualities that can adorn the mind, would never have fallen.</P>

May this equitable &s;entence deter us from cruelly reviling each other, and teach us to live in that brotherly love and harmony which becomes the Followers of Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>

<Q>Honour thy Father and thy Mother, that thy days may be long in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS is a precept on which I do not re|member ever to have heard a &s;ermon, though it enjoins a duty which I fear we have too often occa&s;ion to be reminded of.</P>
<P>The great law of Nature has implanted in every human brea&s;t a di&s;po&s;ition to love and revere tho&s;e to whom we have been taught, from our earlie&s;t infancy, to look up for every comfort, conveniency, and plea&s;ure in life; while that &s;tate of dependency remains, the impre&s;&s;ion continues in its full force, but cer|tain it is that it gradually weakens and wears off as we become ma&s;ters of our&s;elves, which made it indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary, le&s;t we &s;hould dege|nerate into ingratitude and di&s;obedience, that a
<PB N="58" REF="015584_0057_0F9990DE5E38C548">
po&s;itive command &s;hould be given; and, to render this injunction the more forcible, God has annexed to it a peculiar reward, a number of happy years to tho&s;e who&s;e filial obedience is &s;uch as is acceptable to the common Father of all: and as he has been plea&s;ed to expre&s;s his approbation of a &s;teady adherence to this law, by &s;ingular marks of favour, &s;o likewi&s;e did he puni&s;h the breach of it by exemplary di&s;plea&s;ure; death was the only expiation of this crime.</P>
<P>Nor were the Jews the only nation who looked upon di&s;obedience to parents as worthy of capital puni&s;hment. Even at this day I have heard it confidently affirmed that, among the Chine&s;e, &s;hould a &s;on &s;o far forget him&s;elf as to lift his hand in a ho&s;tile manner again&s;t his father, not only him&s;elf, but his wife and chil|dren would be put to death, his &s;ervants and dependents would &s;hare the &s;ame fate, the hou&s;e where he lived would be razed, and the ground &s;own with &s;alt, as &s;uppo&s;ing that there mu&s;t be the mo&s;t hopele&s;s depravity of manners in a community to which &s;uch a mon&s;ter belonged.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="015584_0058_0F9990DF1EAC7A60">
Herodotus, in his account of the religion and cu&s;toms of the Per&s;ians, tells us that they look|ed on parricide as an impo&s;&s;ible thing; and that when any action happened, which appeared to be like it, the reputed &s;on was con&s;idered as &s;uppo&s;itious, and probably owing his birth to adultery: their notion, in this particular, &s;uffi|ciently &s;hewed in what a heinous light they regarded the &s;in of undutifulne&s;s in general.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, when any di&s;pute betwixt parents and children ri&s;es high, I am inclinable to think the latter the aggre&s;&s;ors. The anxious &s;olicitude of parental affection, the daily fatigue which attends the nurture of helple&s;s infancy, the unwearied application that is requi&s;ite for the formation of the minds of youth, the anxie|ties which the parent feels for the future wel|fare of his offspring, often, perhaps, denying him&s;elf conveniences that his children may have &s;uperfluities, are obligations &s;uch as can never be acquitted; and, I own, it has often given me great pain when I have heard it re|marked that love de&s;cended: &s;urely &s;uch an ob&s;ervation is a reproach to human nature.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="015584_0059_0F9990DFEAF3FCA8">
Is it po&s;&s;ible that paternal tenderne&s;s &s;hould outweigh filial gratitude? That a knowledge of long try'd friend&s;hip, experienced virtues, and the receiving benefits, which, were we to employ our&s;elves daily in paying, would &s;till leave us debtors, &s;hould form weaker ties than what proceed chiefly from in&s;tinct&punc; and are fixed even bfore we can judge whether the creature on whom we lavi&s;h our fondne&s;s is worthy of it or not.</P>
<P>Strange! that the receiving of favours &s;hould le&s;s in&s;pire us with &s;entiments of love, genero|&s;ity, and re&s;pect, than the conferring them! that the patron or parent &s;hould be le&s;s dear to the dependent o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> child, than the dependent or child to the patron or parent! Yet it is certain, that there are many more undutiful children than there are unkind parents: the great wi&s;|dom of the Creator has determined there &s;hould be few of the latter, in order to the pre&s;ervation of mankind; but &s;urely that there &s;hould be many of the former is a di&s;grace to humanity. The Almighty, our benevolent Father, has, in many places of &s;acred writ, denounced the heavie&s;t cur&s;es again&s;t tho&s;e who honour not their parents.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="015584_0060_0F9990E0983D0848">
On the contrary, he who&s;e heart is endowed with filial pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ty, may look up to heaven with a certain a&s;&s;urance of having his prayers heard, his de&s;ires gratified, and of meeting with that return of duty from his children which he has &s;hewn to his parents. But he who has filled his father's &s;oul with bitterne&s;s, and drawn tears from his mother's eyes, may ju&s;tly fear a &s;on that will revenge their wrongs.</P>
<P>The judgments of God can never appear more &s;everely than by making them feel, in their own per&s;ons, the &s;harp pangs which are occa&s;ioned by the ingratitude of children. I believe it &s;eldom happens but that di&s;obedience is puni&s;hed this way; for they who have been forgetful them&s;elves of the great duty owing to tho&s;e from whom they drew their birth, will rarely teach it their offspring.</P>
<P>A love of that &s;elf which they &s;ee renewed in their children, generally makes them run into a blind fondne&s;s, which leaves them the dupes of their own folly; for tho&s;e, who, by their example, have learned neither love or e&s;teem, are &s;ure to turn that unmerited partiality
<PB N="62" REF="015584_0061_0F9990E1C6001A30">
to their own emolument, and de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e from whom they receive it.</P>
<P>In the earlie&s;t ages of the world, men were wont to look on a parent's ble&s;&s;ing as a thing of the greate&s;t con&s;equence to their future hap|pine&s;s, and to dread his cur&s;e as an entail of mi&s;ery on them and their po&s;terity. Nor were the&s;e hopes and fears without foundation; for we have many in&s;tances in ancient hi&s;tory where God &s;eems to confirm what the father has wi&s;hed to &s;ucceeding generations: and this mu&s;t certainly have a good effect on the minds of children, as they would de&s;ire to avoid mi&s;ery and obtain happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Let us not look on it as &s;uper&s;titious to &s;up|po&s;e that &s;uch wi&s;hes may &s;till carry weight with them, and that our fulfilling or neglecting our duty to parents may be rewarded or puni&s;h|ed, even in this world. But &s;hould that not be the ca&s;e, if we have any belief in religion, we may know that it will be &s;o in another; and &s;urely what la&s;ts to eternity is worth our care. I cannot help here remarking a &s;pecies of ingratitude and folly, which is but too common: it often happens that people in a low &s;tation of life are
<PB N="63" REF="015584_0062_0F9990E23459BFA8">
&s;olicitous that their children &s;hall ri&s;e to a higher degree: to affect which, they think no labour too much; they deny them&s;elves every plea&s;ure, except what proceeeds from imagination, in anticipating the figure which their young ones &s;hall hereafter make in the world.</P>
<P>They are indeed, for the mo&s;t part, much too &s;anguine in their expectations; but &s;uppo&s;e them quite an&s;wered, and that they &s;ee their children in a &s;ituation &s;uperior to their hopes, yet how often does it happen that the con&s;e|quence of their being rai&s;ed, in&s;tead of exciting &s;entiments of gratitude and re&s;pect towards tho&s;e who gave up every thing to make them what they are, is, that they are a&s;hamed of their origninal, and blu&s;h to acknowledge their pa|rents and benefactors; who receive no other return for their kindne&s;s than the being &s;hun|ned in public, and de&s;pi&s;ed in private.</P>
<P>In this ca&s;e, the mi&s;taken notions of the parent is no excu&s;e for the ba&s;e ingratitude of the child. But there are &s;ome who call them|&s;elves dutiful, and perhaps are called &s;o by the world, becau&s;e they are never deficient in any outward marks of re&s;pect, which co&s;t them no|thing,

thing, but are very &s;paring in admini&s;tering to their parents nece&s;&s;ities. Indeed it is the duty of a man, if his circum&s;tances will admit of it, never to let a parent know what nece&s;&s;ity is, but to be indu&s;trious in finding out their wants, without putting them to the humbling ta&s;k of reciting them, and a&s;king that as a favour which they have a right to demand as a debt.</P>
<P>It is not giving alone, but giving without grudging or the lea&s;t &s;eeming reluctance, that can make the gift valuable where &s;o much is owing: not a murmur, not a complaint &s;hould be heard; but the cheerfulne&s;s of the counte|nance &s;hould rather expre&s;s a &s;en&s;e of receiving than conferring an obligation. Nor is it &s;uffi|cient to allow ju&s;t enough to keep them above want; to allot a certain &s;um, and, if we find it not la&s;t to the time we expected, &s;eem to wonder at it, as if we exacted an account where we have no right to expect any; but, on the contrary, it is our duty to take care that there &s;hall be always &s;omething more than enough: &s;urely there is no rea&s;on to fear that a parent will ever make an ill u&s;e of the genero&s;ity of his children. But, above all, there is one thing of which we ought never to be guilty; I mean the trumpeting to
<PB N="65" REF="015584_0064_0F9990E3AA8FB8B0">
the world our deeds, as if we a&s;&s;umed to our|&s;elves a merit in making our money &s;ub&s;ervient to a mere act of duty. If a parent has any de|licacy, it will be terrible to hear from a third per&s;on, of the obligations they are under to their children; to tho&s;e who owe to them not only their being, but their health, their educa|tion, their all, and without who&s;e &s;u&s;taining hand they had now been them&s;elves de&s;titute of &s;upport.</P>
<P>I have now done with this branch of my &s;ubject, as I look upon it there would be no end an&s;wered farther; &s;ince, after all, if a man's own mind does not incline him to act liberally toward his parents, it will be hardly po&s;&s;ible to in&s;til it into him. But there is another error which people of perhaps real goodne&s;s of heart in other particulars, are apt to fall into; the de&s;pi&s;ing the want of that genius, politene&s;s, and addre&s;s, in their parents, which them&s;elves are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed off; in&s;tead of exerting their abilities to conceal the&s;e defects from the eyes of others, they are the fir&s;t to expo&s;e and ridicule them, thinking by that means to make their own ex|cellence the more admired: but &s;urely the di&s;|play of talents, at the expence of tho&s;e to whom
<PB N="66" REF="015584_0065_0F9990E4696D0E88">
we owe mo&s;t reverence, is a vanity below our pur&s;uit. No one can be exalted by the degra|dation of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;uperior quali|ties they will appear, and never can &s;hine forth with greater lu&s;tre than when they are employed in &s;howing tho&s;e, from whom we derive our being, in a re&s;pectable light.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this di&s;cour&s;e with an exhor|tation &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider of the va&s;t debt which is due to parents, of the ab&s;olute command of God to obedience, and the many cur&s;es de|nounced again&s;t tho&s;e who refu&s;e to obey.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>HAVING already treated on the &s;ubject of the duty owing from children to parents, I pro|ceed, in the next place, to explain what I think is the real duty from parents to children, which I look on to be little under&s;tood, notwith&s;tand|ing the mi&s;taken partiality they too often feel for them.</P>
<P>While they think no expence too much, no pains too great to be&s;tow, in giving them tho&s;e &s;howy accompli&s;hments which will di&s;tingui&s;h them in the world, they too often neglect to teach them a true knowledge of them&s;elves, a government of their pa&s;&s;ions, and that uniform rectitude of manners, without which all &s;uperfi|cial outward ornaments are vain and empty.
<PB N="68" REF="015584_0067_0F9990E5DDB94C78">
Religion is the ba&s;e on which all virtue is built; it ought, therefore, to be the bu&s;ine&s;s of the educator to in&s;til into the minds of his pupil an early veneration for the Deity; a fear of offend|ing that God who is omnipre&s;ent, who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity, and from who&s;e ble&s;&s;ing alone they can ever hope for happine&s;s, either in this world or the next.</P>
<P>This fir&s;t foundation carefully laid, is &s;eldom known not to have an influence through life. Such is the force of habit, that tho&s;e who have had the advantage of a religious education are &s;hocked at the fir&s;t appearances of vice, and very rarely deviate far from the le&s;&s;ons of virtue which they have learnt in their infancy.</P>
<P>As the chi&s;&s;el works the rude block, into &s;hape, &s;o education forms the human &s;oul, which would otherwi&s;e be filled with nothing more than a jumble of wild unconnected ideas, in|capable of forming it&s;elf into any regular &s;y&s;tem. If we enquire into the cau&s;es why there are &s;uch numbers of people in the world who &s;eem to have no &s;ettled principles of right or wrong, but to be &s;wayed by intere&s;t or pa&s;&s;ion in every action of their lives, we &s;hall find it chiefly
<PB N="69" REF="015584_0068_0F9990E69C340820">
owing to the wrong bias of their education. Parents are more &s;olicitous that their children &s;hould &s;hine through the brilliancy of their wit, and politene&s;s of addre&s;s, than excel in a plain unaffected goodne&s;s of heart. In fine, they wi&s;h them rather to talk eloquently than act virtuou&s;ly. But, good God! of how little con|&s;equence is a flow of words, unle&s;s they convey the real dictates of a mind untainted with folly, and uncorrupted with vice.</P>
<P>It is much to be wi&s;hed that the hone&s;t ear might never be enchanted by fal&s;e rea&s;oning, delivered in a graceful manner, and that it might never be in the power of the wicked to acquire the aid of rhetoric. To prevent which evil the &s;eeds of religion &s;hould be fir&s;t &s;own in the infant mind, the be&s;t &s;tock on which to engraft the moral virtues, and without which founda|tion to inculcate le&s;&s;ons of morality mu&s;t be vain. Every the lea&s;t tendency to vice &s;hould be checked, becau&s;e if thought on as of little con&s;equence, and &s;o overlooked or indulged, it &s;oon grows into habit, and habitual faults are very hard to conquer.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="015584_0069_0F9990E758219108">
The mo&s;t u&s;eful part of education is to learn and practi&s;e our duty towards God, and towards our neighbour; to be &s;trictly and con&s;cienti|ou&s;ly ju&s;t; and what is &s;till more, to be liberal without o&s;tentation; to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that tender feeling for others &s;ufferings, which, in its &s;everal degrees, extends it&s;elf to every animal of creation, from our fellow creatures to the lowe&s;t reptile, are qualities infinitely &s;uperior to what commonly embelli&s;h people of the mo&s;t refined education.</P>
<P>In vain do we heap up riches for our chil|dren, if we take no care to inform them in what manner they &s;hould u&s;e them: in&s;tead of pre|&s;erving their virtue we are laying &s;nares for it, by providing them the means of indulging vices, which a life of labour and indu&s;try might have prevented their having lei&s;ure to think of. In the bringing up of children parents ought not to rely entirely on their own judgments, &s;ince their partiality often prevents them from &s;eeing, and &s;till more often from correcting errors in their offspring, which in their future lives may be of fatal con&s;equence.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="015584_0070_0F9990E81717B670">
An ancient philo&s;opher being a&s;ked, What he thought mo&s;t proper for children to learn? an&s;wered, That which they ought to do when they grow up. It is unrea&s;onable to expect an equal improvement in all children; &s;ome minds open very &s;lowly, and require great pains in in&s;tructing, and others are &s;o very barren, that it is working again&s;t nature to teach them any thing; if the&s;e are harmle&s;s it is &s;ufficient, and to attempt to in&s;til a greater knowledge than to di&s;tingui&s;h right from wrong, is only to do them hurt.</P>
<P>But there are &s;ome who di&s;play an uncom|mon under&s;tanding, at an age when nothing is expected from them; the doating parent is &s;o plea&s;ed with this early appearance of wit, and admires his child's lively parts to &s;uch a degree as to leave him almo&s;t to his own guidance; who &s;oon becomes &s;en&s;ible of his con&s;equence, and grows negligent from a per&s;ua&s;ion that he has already attained the height of improvement, by which mi&s;take he generally appears at twenty the &s;ame that he was at ten.</P>
<P>It has often been a matter of di&s;pute, whe|ther public or private tuition is mo&s;t eligible;
<PB N="72" REF="015584_0071_0F9990E8D99A3AD0">
undoubtedly, where a preceptor has only one pupil to attend, he may &s;tudy his di&s;po&s;ition in &s;uch a manner as to let nothing pa&s;s unob&s;erv|ed, which may be either of future advantage or detriment to him: in his frequent conver&s;a|tions he may convey in&s;truction in the mo&s;t plea&s;ing manner, if he has the art of letting it fall naturally in, and lo&s;ing the name of tutor in that of friend; when the appearance of the tutor is too rigidly di&s;played, he is li&s;tened to perhaps with re&s;pect, but generally with too great a di&s;like for any of his precepts to make an impre&s;&s;ion on the hearer.</P>
<P>But I think it not impo&s;&s;ible, in a great mea|&s;ure, to practi&s;e this addre&s;s, even where there are numbers; and one advantage there certainly is where there is a community, that it will create an emulation, a laudable de&s;ire to excel.</P>
<P>There are in&s;tances of children who will &s;hed tears at being outdone: this temper; if kept within proper limits, and not &s;uffered to dege|nerate into envy, may be a noble incitement to virtue; as that is the mo&s;t promi&s;ing di&s;po&s;ition where &s;hame is the greate&s;t puni&s;hment that can be inflicted: to &s;uch prai&s;e will ever be

the greate&s;t reward, and will never lo&s;e its end; but will always be a means of preventing negli|gence, and a &s;pur to indu&s;try in every ta&s;k they undertake. There is one method of teaching of which I cannot approve; I mean &s;evere di&s;|cipline: I know no mind on which this treat|ment can have the de&s;ired effect; the generous and open it provokes, the gentle it terrifies, and the obdurate it hardens.</P>
<P>I look upon it, that there is no greater pre|&s;ervative again&s;t the temptations which be&s;t youth, than the being engaged in the attaining of any u&s;eful knowledge: Idlene&s;s is the nur&s;e of evil thoughts, and it ought to be the chief care of parents to engage the young mind in a continual pur&s;uit of &s;ome valuable acqui&s;ition, until it has learned wi&s;dom and philo&s;ophy &s;uf|ficient to regulate its conduct.</P>
<P>An old Greek poet u&s;ed to &s;ay, that educa|tion was like the hand and ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, it rooted up vice, and planted virtue. It is to be lamented, but is certainly true, that what is called the be&s;t education is, for the mo&s;t part, the wor&s;t: dancing, mu&s;ic, and French, take up &s;o much time, that there is little left for more u&s;eful

&s;tudies: thought the&s;e are accompli&s;hments that &s;hould not be entirely &s;lighted, yet they ought not to be thought of con&s;equence &s;ufficient to employ whole years in learning, which is often the ca&s;e; while the greater concerns, what would qualify them for amiable members of &s;ociety, make them worthy ma&s;ters and mi&s;|tre&s;&s;es, and valuable friends, are totally for|gotten.</P>
<P>I would not have it here under&s;tood as if I thought all the hours of childhood &s;hould be employed in grave exerci&s;es: relaxation is un|doubtedly nece&s;&s;ary both for the body and mind; to divide their time between learning and amu&s;ement, &s;o that they may ever return to the former with plea&s;ure and alacrity, and &s;tudy may never &s;eem irk&s;ome to them, is the great art, and what teachers &s;hould chiefly attend to.</P>
<P>Hitherto I have &s;poken in general terms of both &s;exes, I &s;hall now confine my&s;elf to the female one, who&s;e education is of great con&s;equence to the world, and is, I think, in general, &s;adly mi&s;taken. Boarding &s;chools are the places where they are u&s;ually bred: as I
<PB N="75" REF="015584_0074_0F9990EB24704328">
have had frequent opportunities of making ob&s;ervations on the&s;e &s;eminaries of feminine learning, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I never &s;aw any who&s;e management I could entirely approve of. They &s;eldom teach any thing more than external modes, and outward ceremonies; the go|verne&s;s's own knowledge rarely extending fur|ther: and as they are oftener people of a narrow than a liberal mind, they are generally partial to tho&s;e children who have mo&s;t fortune, or from whom they receive the greate&s;t advantage.</P>
<P>Add to this, that the chief care of them is left to teachers, who are for the mo&s;t part, e&s;pecially the French, extremely ignorant, and from whom they oftener learn di&s;gui&s;e, and little low cunning, than any good qualities. They are often taught to &s;ay their prayers in a language which they don't under&s;tand; and addre&s;s their God by way of getting by rote a French le&s;&s;on: to be able to retain a few phra&s;es in the &s;ame tongue, is thought of more con&s;e|quence than any thing el&s;e, and a conver&s;ation in their own is &s;trictly forbidden: the breach of which command is puni&s;hed as a great fault. The minds of girls are much more pliant than the minds of boys, and may, in their

childhood, be moulded which way you plea&s;e: how nece&s;&s;ary then is it to give them a right turn, to in&s;til into their tender nature every principle of virtue and goodne&s;s. Having once in&s;pired them with that univer&s;al benevolence, which is the &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity, politene&s;s and complai&s;ance will, in a great degree, be taught by it; and a few forms, which may be &s;oon acquired, is all that is wanting to make compleat good breeding.</P>
<P>I am far from thinking that women &s;hould be taught no kind of literature, or believing they will make wor&s;e mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of families for having more learning than their cookmaid: on the contrary, I think they are the fitter for the office, as I imagine every man of &s;en&s;e will wi&s;h his wife to be not merely a dome&s;tic, but a friend and companion; for which rea&s;on I would recommend &s;uch &s;tudies as tend to enlarge the under&s;tanding, improve the ideas, and entertain the &s;oul with the beauties of na|ture and virtue. Oeconomy and hou&s;ewifery are nece&s;&s;ary branches of female education, and works of ingenuity and fancy may fill up the lei&s;ure hours, both innocently and agreeably: tho&s;e who have a ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> for mu&s;ic ought to be

encouraged; but it is ridiculous for one who has neither voice or ear to throw away that time in forcing nature which might be &s;pent to more u&s;eful purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>In fine, the great end of education is to teach us the true knowledge of the Deity, and through that knowledge to love and adore Him; and, as much as our finite natures will let us, to imitate the bright example He has &s;et us. Which that we may all do, God of his infinite mercy grant, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t. AMEN.</P>
