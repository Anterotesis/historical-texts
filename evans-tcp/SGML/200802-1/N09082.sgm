<P><HI>THE few hi&s;tories of the &s;ettling of New-England now extant, are very &s;carce among the people in genaral; and the ri&s;ing generation in particular, are very much unacquainted with the di&s;tre&s;&s;es their ance&s;tors encounter'd, who&s;e zeal and virtue &s;hould not be forgotten.&mdash;It is apprehended a brief view of their trials, hard&s;hips and perils, may not be altogether unprofitable to tho&s;e few of them who &s;hall read the following di&s;cour&s;es. The hi&s;torical part is &s;omewhat more enlarged upon in &s;ome few in&s;tances here, than it was in the delivery. As to any fa&s;ts, where the author conceived any di&s;putes would ari&s;e in the minds of any per&s;ons, he has carefully cited &s;ome of tho&s;e authorities which &s;upport them.

Only a few brief hints could be given in the&s;e limitted di&s;cour&s;es&mdash;a compleat hi&s;tory from &s;ome able hand, is ardently wi&s;hed for. Were tho&s;e things related with that energy the importance of the &s;ubject calls for, they could not fail of engaging univer&s;al attention. That our privileges, civil and religious, may be continued inviolate, and that &s;erious, devout, hea|venly &s;pirit, which animated, and &s;o happily di&s;tingui&s;hed our forefathers may prevail, to the late&s;t po&s;terity, is the ardent prayer of</HI></P>

<P>_THESE are &s;ome of the words of Mo&s;es, the man of GOD, which he &s;pake to the children of I&s;rael, the di&s;tingui&s;h'd people of the LORD, not long before he went from the plains of Moab unto the top of mount Pi&s;gah, where that eminent &s;ervant of the LORD expir'd. He reminds them of the wonderful things GOD had done for them&mdash;the &s;tatutes and judgments, in &s;pecial given to them&mdash;their peculiar obligations faithfully to &s;erve the LORD, and the dreadfully aggravated doom, which would be the con&s;equence of their neglect&punc; Tho&s;e things were faithfully and very carefully to be tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity. The ri&s;ing generation was to be led to an intimate and particular ac|quaintance with GOD's wonderful works, and miraculous operati|ons for that people. When they fa&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed and humbled them&s;elves be|fore GOD for their &s;ins, under a &s;en&s;e of heavens frowns, in after generations, we find they took &s;pecial notice of tho&s;e glorious things
<PB N="6" REF="011595_0005_0F874504A4201BA0">
GOD had done for their fathers.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Neh 9 Chap.</NOTE>By reflecting upon which, they were brought more fully to that humility, which is nece&s;&s;ary to keep a fa&s;t to the LORD acceptably. Agreeable hereto, we find Mo&s;es in our context, giving that people, a very &s;olemn exhortation to re|pentance and obedience, calling heaven and earth to te&s;tify again&s;t them, that they &s;hould &s;oon utterly peri&s;h from off the land which they were going to po&s;&s;e&s;s, if they departed from the LORD and did evil in his &s;ight. In this &s;olemn addre&s;s they are led to con&s;ider what a&s;toni&s;hing things GOD had done for and before them; and their peculiar obligations thence ari&s;ing, to fear and &s;erve the LORD. In what a grave and &s;olemn, affectionate and &s;triking manner doth Mo&s;es rehear&s;e the&s;e things to them, from V.32 and onward: a&s;k former ages <HI>even from the days that GOD created man</HI>&mdash;look to di&s;tant places, even <HI>from one &s;ide of heaven to the other, whether there hath been any thing known or beard of, like what GOD hath done for you? Did ever any people hear GOD &s;peaking to them from the mid&s;t of fire, as thou ha&s;t heard and live?</HI> The &s;triking repre&s;entation and affectionate addre&s;s, he clo&s;es with the words of our text. <HI>And becau&s;e he loved thy fathers, therefore he cho&s;e their &s;eed after them,</HI> &amp;c. Where Ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. As GOD had a peculiar regard to their fathers, Abraham, I&s;aac and Jacob, &s;o GOD extended his compa&s;&s;ionate regards and the to|kens of di&s;tingui&s;hing re&s;pect to their offspring. Is not the &s;ame ap|plicable to us and our fathers?&mdash;GOD took Abraham from his fa|ther's hou&s;e, from his kindred and country;&mdash;&s;ent him to &s;et up GOD's true wor&s;hip in a &s;trange land. The Almighty took our fa|thers from their native land, when the nation was in confu&s;ion, and they groaned under &s;piritual tyranny, being extremely harra&s;s'd, &s;ome ca&s;t into pri&s;ons, others be&s;et in their hou&s;es for wor&s;hipping GOD according to the dictates of their own con&s;ciences, which was then prohibited.<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Vid. Pr. Chron. of N. E. V.1 P 23. Mort. Mem. P. 1 2.</NOTE> GOD brought them into this land to &s;et up his wor&s;hip here. And notwith&s;tanding the refractorine&s;s of their po&s;|terity, yet GOD hath made them his peculiar care. Ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="2">2. GOD furni&s;hed them with the cleare&s;t evidences of his di&s;tin|gui&s;hing regard, by the wonderful things he had done for and in the mid&s;t
<PB N="7" REF="011595_0006_0F87457E21623BF0">
of them. That people had ocular demon&s;tration of the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;h|ing miracles and a &s;eries of wonderful providences; &s;ome of which are enumerated in our text and ver&s;es preceeding. The angel of the covenant the LORD JESUS, under the character of I&s;rael's GOD and lawgiver &s;pake to them from the burning bu&s;h and quaking mount&mdash;<HI>took them by &s;igns and terrors from the mid&s;t of another nation&mdash;drave out from before them nations greater and mightier than they were</HI>&mdash;Og King of Ba&s;han, and Sihon King of He&s;hbon: giving his cho&s;en their land for a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Since the canon of &s;cripture is full, mira|cles are not to be expected: bateing which we &s;hall find that which is very &s;imilar to this, in the conduct of divine providence to our fa|thers; from before whom GOD hath driven out the nations that dwelt in this land. As they grew ripe for ruin, filling up the mea|&s;ure of their &s;ins, GOD gave us their land for an inheritance, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> is this day.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE improvement they were to make of the&s;e di&s;pen&s;ations, in a &s;olemn manner urged. Con&s;ider in thine heart, the LORD he is GOD, and he alone&mdash;&s;upreme governor of all worlds&mdash;infinitely wi&s;e, holy, ju&s;t and good: Him you are under peculiar advantages to know, and the mo&s;t inviolable obligations to obey&mdash;to keep tho&s;e &s;tatutes and commandments GOD had given them. They are call'd upon and charged, &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider what a being GOD is; what he had done for them, and the obligations thence ari&s;ing&mdash;to tran&s;|mit the knowledge of them to future generations, and by holy lives, recommend true religion, the wor&s;hip and ordinances of GOD, to their offspring. Thus were they to perpetuate the knowledge of the&s;e things, and that holy religion which GOD commanded, to fu|ture ages. Our obligations are far from being inferior, nor is our duty le&s;s important.</P>
<P N="4">4. HERE are peculiar motives &s;et before them, powerfully to induce and even con&s;train them to the con&s;cientious ob&s;ervance, and religi|ous improvement of the&s;e things. That it might go well with them&mdash;that they might enjoy peculiar comfort in life, having GOD's gracious pre&s;ence with them&mdash;divine protection afforded&mdash;&s;ee many good days here, enjoying &s;piritual and temporal ble&s;&s;ings in this

world, and a ble&s;&s;ed immortality beyond the grave. And that it, might go well with their children; that they might be ble&s;&s;ed in him in whom (it was promi&s;ed) all the nations of the earth &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed&mdash;tran&s;mit to po&s;terity yet unborn, peculiar ble&s;&s;ings and priviledges unimpaired&mdash;that after having prolonged their days in that good land, and come to their graves like a &s;hock of corn fully ripe; &s;till they, in their &s;eed, might forever, even to the late&s;t ge|nerations dwell and be happy in that good land which the LORD their GOD had given them by promi&s;e, and was now ready to intro|duce them to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of. By a rich variety of intere&s;ting mo|tives, GOD is graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed, to enforce man's duty. Not barely their own felicity, but the good of their po&s;terity is brought into the account. As tho&s;e temporal ble&s;&s;ings were typical of cele&s;tial joys, &s;o every thing for them&s;elves, together with tho&s;e near and mo&s;t dear to them, is &s;ugge&s;ted, to animate them to con&s;ider GOD's works and obey his commands.</P>
<P>FROM the words of our text thus con&s;ider'd, a variety of con&s;ider|ations not un&s;uitable to the pre&s;ent &s;olemn occa&s;ion, offer them&s;elves to &s;erious meditation. Particularly, we might con&s;ider, the infinite &s;elf-moving love and mercy of GOD to fallen creatures; and how the&s;e have been di&s;play'd in various ages.&mdash;How GOD is a covenant keep|ing GOD, handing down ble&s;&s;ings to his people and their offspring&mdash;what peculiar deliverances GOD grants his people&mdash;the ways and means, times and occa&s;ions of them.&mdash;That it is infinitely ea&s;y with the Almighty to drive out the &s;tronge&s;t nations from before the wea|ker; <HI>cau&s;ing one to cha&s;e a thou&s;and, and two to put ten thou&s;and to flight.</HI> But pa&s;&s;ing the&s;e without particular enlargement; the method pro|po&s;ed, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, is to con&s;ider,

Mo&s;es Jo&s;hua, Samuel and David, took &s;pecial care to remind that people, of what GOD had done for them.

to perpetuate the memory of his wonderful works. And it is rea&s;onable, that as GOD commands, &s;o he &s;hou'd, (humanly &s;peaking) expect this. There is in mankind a general de&s;ire of knowing things remarkable among men. How &s;olicitou&s;ly then &s;hou'd the wonder|ful works of GOD be attended unto? When the&s;e are handed down from age to age, they &s;hew forth the greatne&s;s and glory, ju&s;tice, or mercy, goodne&s;s or veracity of GOD; and tend to excite men to con|&s;ider in their hearts and know that the LORD he is GOD. This being realized, hath a natural tendency to fill the minds of intelligent be|ings, with a &s;olemn awe of the Supreme Maje&s;ty. Had mankind a <HI>proper</HI> &s;en&s;e of the infinite greatne&s;s and glory of the Deity, what an happy influence wou'd it have upon their minds and morals! When they &s;et the LORD before their faces, they will, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, live in his fear.&mdash;How ju&s;tly may it then be expected that dependant, ac|countable beings &s;hould tran&s;mit to future generations, the memora|ble and peculiarly affecting providences of GOD. This leads,</P>
<P>II. TO CONSIDER how GOD hath driven out the nations, the abori|ginals, from before our fathers, and tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent generation, to give us their land for an inheritance, as it is this day.</P>
<P>ALL the providences of GOD harmonize, and are over-rul'd for bringing about the glorious de&s;igns of heaven; and &s;o will conti|nue 'till the &s;cene of mutable things here below, &s;hall terminate in the final con&s;ummation of all things. Some foot&s;teps of divine providence, we may at pre&s;ent, briefly trace; &s;hewing how we were brought to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this good land, which the LORD our GOD hath given us. What future &s;cenes we, (or po&s;terity) may have to pa&s;s through, GOD only knows. Innumerable, and to us incon|ceivable, were the trials, perils and hard&s;hips, which our ance&s;tors endur'd, in fir&s;t &s;ettling of <HI>New-England:</HI> while briefly recollecting &s;ome few of which, I rely upon the candor, and hope for the patience of this auditory; and that the ri&s;ing generation in &s;pecial, (who have had but little opportunity to be acquainted with the&s;e things) may receive &s;ome in&s;truction and improve to the noble&s;t purpo&s;es, the&s;e wonderful works of the LORD.</P>
<P>OUR forefathers, by &s;ad experience found, they could not peacea|bly

enjoy their <HI>liberty</HI> in their native country. Whereupon they re|&s;olved to remove into the Netherlands. After many hindrances and difficulties, (which through the good hand of GOD upon them they &s;urmounted) they went from England to Holland about the year 1608. Tarried about a year at Am&s;terdam&mdash;then removed to Ley|den; where they lived above eleven years, in great love and harmo|ny, both among them&s;elves and neighbour citizens.<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Prince's Chron of N.

Upon the view or which, after having by fa&s;tings, prayers and ma|ny tears, &s;ought direction from the Father of Lights, they determined for North-America, and arrived at Plymouth, in the year A.

who were only &s;pectators, could not refrain from tears. How di&s;|couraging the pro&s;pect before them! The wide and boi&s;trous atlan|tic (which was then very much unknown) to be pa&s;s'd over. This cou'd not fail of being very trying, e&s;pecially to tender female minds, while they heard the cries and groans, and &s;aw the &s;ighings and tears of friends and children. They were coming to an inho&s;pitable &s;hore, among &s;avage barbarians, who&s;e tender mercies were cruelty. Dan|gers, di&s;tre&s;s and ten thou&s;and difficulties &s;hared them full in the face. Yet, animated with noble &s;entiments of liberty, they came hither. Dec. 31, 1620, being LORD'S day, was the fir&s;t &s;abbath they kept on &s;hore, and in the hou&s;e of their building; at which time we may fix the aera of the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of N. England. After the fore|mention'd tryals were pa&s;&s;ed through, they had immediately to en|counter hunger and cold, with great fear and danger, in the pro&s;e|cution of their &s;ettlement. The &s;everity of the &s;ea&s;on, in a rigid climate, without any convenient habitations, where the conveniences of life were all wanting, and nece&s;&s;aries very &s;carce, was very di&s;-di&s;tre&s;&s;ing. The hard&s;hips were too great for a great part of them. Within two or three months one half of them who arriv'd at Ply|mouth, were landed in eternity.

This brought them to terms of peace, which was ratified in 1725. In this war Capt. Lovel was ambu&s;h'd by the enemy, and &s;lain, with &s;everal of his brave men. From 1725 the land had peace for nine|teen years; when war being proclaim'd between England and France (in 1744) we were called again to war.

<P N="2">2. WE are under peculiar obligations to know and &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ve the LORD, as we live in a land of liberty, civil and religious. Liberty, fair offspring of heaven, engages &s;ome of the mo&s;t ardent de&s;ires of generous and noble &s;ouls. They bear the yoke of bondage with re|luctance, and ca&s;t it from them as &s;oon as opportunity pre&s;ents. An ardent thir&s;t for liberty in&s;pir'd our fathers, who &s;led into the wilds of America to find an a&s;ylum from tho&s;e u&s;urpations over the con&s;ci|ences of men, which then prevailed. Hopes of enjoying the &s;weets of liberty, animated them to leave their plea&s;ant seats and fertile fields; to pa&s;s the atlantic, to the&s;e then barbarous &s;hores. Through innumerable perils and hard&s;hips they have tran&s;mitted to us this ine&s;|timable ble&s;&s;ing, which we at pre&s;ent enjoy in the fulle&s;t manner.&mdash;what more can be wi&s;hed for on civil or religious accounts.

to the GOD of our mercies. Peculiar ble&s;&s;ings lay us under pecu+liar obligations.</P>
<P N="3">3. WE are put under peculiar advantages to know GOD and that he is over all: therefore &s;hou'd keep his &s;tatutes.&mdash;We may not only read this important truth in tho&s;e large volumes of nature and providence; from the works of creation, and the common and extra|ordinary occurrences, of which we are &s;pectators; but we have al&s;o the &s;acred oracles to reach us. Therein God hath cau&s;ed all his good|ne&s;s to pa&s;s before us. What heathens grope in the dark concerning and cannot unfold, but are fill'd with perplexing doubts re&s;pecting, is clearly reveal'd in the bible. All that &s;uch beings as we are capa|ble of knowing of GOD, is therein di&s;clos'd; even his communicable glory&mdash;and of man&mdash;his origin, fall, recovery, &amp;c. In the &s;criptures, GOD hath fully &s;hewn that he is &s;upreme governor in the natural and moral worlds. We have all conceivable advantages to know that the LORD he is GOD alone.&mdash;The end of knowledge is practice&mdash;con&s;equently advantages to know, lay us under obligations to per|form.</P>
<P N="4">4. WE have GOD'S &s;tatutes and judgments: therefore mu&s;t heark|en and obey. Heathens are inexcu&s;able for &s;inning again&s;t the light of nature: <HI>not having the written law, they are a law to them&s;elves.</HI> But how much more inexcu&s;able are we, if, after having GOD'S law, &s;ta|tutes and judgments &s;upernaturally reveal'd and publi&s;h'd from hea|ven, we rebel again&s;t GOD? It will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha at the day of judgment than for us, if we &s;in again&s;t &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hing light, love and grace.</P>
<P N="5">5. WE have GOD'S wor&s;hip and ordinances among us, and thereby are under &s;uperadded obligations to know GOD and live to him. The&s;e are the ordinary and &s;pecial means of grace heaven hath appointed for the &s;alvation of fallen creatures. The love of CHRIST &s;hould con&s;train us.</P>
<P N="6">6. WE profe&s;s and acknowledge our&s;elves to be GOD'S people, and enjoy all the privileges of &s;uch. Therefore, are bound to fear and &s;erve the LORD. So I&s;rael of old were di&s;tingui&s;hed; though

Covenant vows and engagements are upon us. GOD'S com|mands and our own vows are too &s;olemn and important to be trifled with. When the vows of GOD are upon you, dare you tran&s;gre&s;s? Is not the obligation too &s;acred to be violated? Will any plead, to extenuate their guilt, that they have not publicly and explicitly en|tered into covenant with GOD? Were you not devoted to GOD, by bapti&s;m in early life? Have you not been in&s;tructed, coun&s;el'd, warn|ed and admoni&s;hed, as being a child of the covenant, being followed with <HI>line upon line precept upon precept?</HI>&mdash;Was you never in wracking di&s;tre&s;s or imminent danger? Under tho&s;e circum&s;tances, did'nt you cry to GOD, mingling vows with your tears, that if GOD would deliver you, the re&s;idue of your days &s;hou'd be devoted to his &s;er|vice? The LORD heard and delivered you; whereby he hath bound down your vows upon you. Wherefore your guilt in the violation of them, remains before GOD. How will you an&s;wer it to God a|nother day, if you violate the&s;e &s;olemn obligations you are under to con&s;ecrate your time, talents and all to GOD? GOD has laid his people under &s;till &s;tronger obligations to keep his &s;tatutes and com|mandments by promi&s;ing glorious rewards to tho&s;e that love and &s;erve him; and by threatning eternal woe and mi&s;ery to the ungod|ly. All the joys of heaven are &s;et before us, to animate us to our duty; and all the horrors of everla&s;ting burnings, to deter us from iniquity.&mdash;GOD may &s;ay to us, what more could have been done, that I have not done for you?&mdash;Once more, as we may, in &s;ubor|dination to GOD'S glory, have re&s;pect to our own and our childrens comfort here and hereafter; &s;o this is mentioned in our text as an inducement and obligation to &s;erve the LORD&mdash;<HI>that it may go well

Yea, and that it may go well with our children after us&mdash;That when we &s;hall be laid in our graves, having nothing more to do with things te|re&s;trial, but &s;hall be immutably fixed in eternity: then our po&s;terity may dwell in this land, &s;urrounded with the ble&s;&s;ings of heaven&mdash;and that we and they may finally meet together in the kingdom of heaven.&mdash;The&s;e things may &s;how us &s;ome of our peculiar obliga|tions to be the LORD'S.</P>

In general, we may ob&s;erve, contempt of GOD and religion, tempting CHRIST and de&s;pi&s;ing go&s;pel grace, are things which GOD abhors and the procuring cau&s;es of divine judgments.&mdash;E&s;pecially if the&s;e prevail, may be expected to be &s;o to New-Eng|land; who&s;e fathers came hither to e&s;cape tho&s;e &s;ins, or rather to e&s;cape per&s;ecution for the contrary virtues.</P>
<P N="1">1. INDIFFERENCY about religion, mu&s;t be peculiarly provoking to GOD; when this temper prevails among the inhabitants of this land, for whom GOD hath. done &s;uch wonderful things.&mdash;What &s;hou'd be mo&s;t is by many lea&s;t cared for. As religion includes acquaintance with GOD &amp; conformity to him, it is matter of the la&s;t importance and concern to mankind. Yet how much is it di&s;regard|ed&mdash;the go&s;pel de&s;pi&s;ed, and how few <HI>&s;eek fir&s;t the kingdom of GOD and the righteou&s;ne&s;s thereof!</HI> Mo&s;t inexcu&s;ably guilty are tho&s;e di&s;|tingui&s;h'd in point of privilege, if they de&s;pi&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. PROFANATION of GOD'S holy &s;abbath, is another &s;in, which will provoke GOD to de&s;troy tho&s;e who have been di&s;tingui&s;h'd as the favourites of heaven. GOD hath &s;et apart and &s;anctified one &s;eventh part of time for him&s;elf, On this day we may not <HI>&s;peak
<PB N="35" REF="011595_0034_0F87459925528508">
our own words, think our own thoughts, nor find our own plea&s;ures.</HI>&mdash;Where no con&s;cientious regard is paid to the &s;abbath, there can be no true religion. Rea&s;on and experience teach us that the religious ob&s;ervation of the LORD's day, with a &s;erious attendance upon the word, &s;acraments and prayer, mu&s;t have a powerful influence on the lives of chri&s;tians. Religion flouri&s;hes or declines among a peo|ple, as the &s;abbath is regarded or profaned.&mdash;GOD is provoked, when his &s;abbath's are profaned and public wor&s;hip neglected. Of old, the indignation of the Almighty was determin'd again&s;t tho&s;e who trampled under foot the &s;acred law of the &s;abbath. Six days are allowed us for our employments; what &s;acrilege to rob GOD of the &s;eventh!</P>
<P>SOME of our ance&s;tors &s;ell under the tokens of royal di&s;plea&s;ure becau&s;e they wou'd not read the book of &s;ports and games, on the LORD's day, for per&s;ons to go to gaming and diver&s;ions after pub|lic wor&s;hip; which was the edict of K. CHARLES the fir&s;t, who is kept &s;o much in remembrance&mdash;But for us to pretend &s;uch &s;ports are right, would be to ri&s;e up in oppo&s;ition to the good and whole|&s;ome laws of our land and nation; yea more&mdash;the laws of GOD, the &s;upreme King.&mdash;No diver&s;ions, worldly di&s;cour&s;es, trifling vi&s;its, reading romances or the like may be allowed of upon GOD's holy day.</P>
<P N="3">3. SERIOUS and devout attendance on the ordinances of the go&s;pel is requir'd; and when the&s;e are either neglected or pro&s;tituted, the great in&s;titutor is highly provoked. By many, the&s;e ordinances are totally neglected,&mdash;This is become too fa&s;hionable. Doth not di&s;|regard to divine ordinances, argue di&s;regard to CHRIST, and too great indifferency about the &s;alvation of our &s;ouls? If this be owing to the carele&s;s, irreligious lives of the profe&s;&s;ors of chri&s;tianity, &s;ure|ly they are doubly guilty. But who dare entertain a low e&s;teem of tho&s;e ordinances CHRIST appointed as with his dying breath. A general omi&s;&s;ion argues, at lea&s;t, coldne&s;s in religion and prevail|ing
<PB N="36" REF="011595_0035_0F874599EFF995F0">
infidelity of heart. By a &s;olemn profe&s;&s;ion, 'tis true, per&s;ons lay them&s;elves under the nece&s;&s;ity of a circum&s;pect life, or di&s;honour them&s;elves by having their practice give the lye to their profe&s;&s;ion. Let all in their re&s;pective places &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider the&s;e things and exert them&s;elves to the utmo&s;t of their power, to wipe away the re|proach ca&s;t upon the glorious REDEEMER and his ordinances. Let the baptized &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider their obligations&mdash;and let all that love the LORD JESUS, cry mightily unto GOD, that he would be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to pour out his &s;pirit plentifully and cau&s;e multi|tudes to fly to CHRIST and attend his ordinances, the neglect of which mu&s;t be provoking to the Almighty.</P>
<P N="4">4. AWFUL neglect of church di&s;cipline, is another thing di&s;plea&s;|ing to heaven. CHRIST appointed church di&s;cipline for the good of mankind. When &s;candalous per&s;ons are not di&s;ciplin'd, but there are ways to e&s;cape go&s;pel cen&s;ure, by &s;ome means or other; this is a threatening &s;ymptom. When baptized per&s;ons are not con|&s;idered as under the obligations of the covenant, nor educated and di&s;ciplined as children of the covenant.&mdash;To have the ri&s;ing gene|ration grow up in profligacy and di&s;&s;olutene&s;s of manners, without religious principles impre&s;&s;ed upon their con&s;ciences, is one of the mo&s;t ill-boding progno&s;tics.</P>
<P N="5">5. PROFANENESS&mdash;cu&s;tomary and habitual &s;wearing are &s;ins of a crim&s;on dye, and will not fail to incen&s;e the DEITY. The prophet Jeremiah declared in the name of the LORD, that, <HI>becau&s;e of &s;wearing the land mourned.</HI> When our fathers came into this country, a man who had lived here for &s;even years, on his return to Old England, declared that during this &s;pace, he never heard a profane oath, nor &s;aw a man drunk. How are the times changed! the late war &s;er|ved greatly to corrupt the morals of many youth, and &s;pread pro|fanene&s;s through this continent. This &s;in provokes GOD, without plea&s;ing one of the &s;en&s;es. It is a ta&s;tele&s;s, fruitle&s;s &s;in&mdash;an horrid
<PB N="37" REF="011595_0036_0F87459A9E6B1048">
perver&s;ion of the u&s;e of &s;peech, which is a &s;ort of miracle in nature. Are youth &s;uitably watch'd coun&s;el'd, admoni&s;h'd, and when guilty puni&s;hed? If our air be tainted with the language of hell, no won|der if we feel the judgments of heaven. By &s;ome in our land, is not the tremendous name of Almighty GOD to&s;s'd, wantonly and bla&s;phemou&s;ly to&s;s'd upon their impious tongues? The LORD will not hold them guiltle&s;s.</P>
<P N="6">6. INTEMPERANCE is another &s;in provoking to GOD, and very pernicious to mankind. It is &s;uch an enemy to all that is virtuous, decent or religious that all mankind &s;hou'd ri&s;e up with utmo&s;t in|dignation again&s;t it. This expo&s;es to every other &s;in&mdash;brings a train of calamities&mdash;de&s;troys the con&s;titution here, and the &s;oul fore|ver&mdash;drives away GOD'S holy &s;pirit&mdash;unfits for religious exerci&s;es&mdash;wa&s;tes the e&s;tate&mdash;benumbs the &s;en&s;es&mdash;&s;tupifies con&s;cience&mdash;di&s;ho|nours GOD, and will procure an inundation of divine wrath. When per&s;ons act as though they would drink up Jordon at a draught, and all the &s;piritous liquors in the we&s;tern i&s;les, cannot &s;lake their thir&s;t; yea, and are ready to ble&s;s them&s;elves in their hearts, &s;aying, we &s;hall have peace though we walk in the imagination of our heart, adding drunkenne&s;s to thir&s;t, then their de&s;truction is nigh and un|avoidable&mdash;For rea&s;onable man, who is a candidate for heaven, to part with his rea&s;on, his con&s;cience, his GOD and heaven, for a few &s;en&s;ual draughts, which only tend to his &s;hame and mi&s;ery here, as well as torment hereafter, is a mo&s;t de&s;perate pitch of fully and madne&s;s,&mdash;Yea, for tho&s;e who &s;wim in rivers of GOD'S goodne&s;s, thus to abu&s;e the bounties of heaven, in &s;ome re&s;pects, exceeds the &s;ins of devils. Such an horrid abu&s;e of the ble&s;&s;ings of heaven, throwing them as in the face of the donor, the damn'd have no op|portunity for.&mdash;When once the appetite has got the a&s;cendecy of a per&s;on, he is in a fearfully dangerous &s;tate: and finding this to be the ca&s;e, ought immediately to mortify his appetite, by an utter renun|ciation of all &s;uch intoxicating &s;pirits, as he would hope for heaven.</P>

<P>AGAIN, neglect of family prayer is another GOD provoking abo|mination.

Of all men we are then mo&s;t inexcu&s;able, if we rebel again&s;t GOD. Hath GOD dealt &s;o with any people as with us and our fathers? Our frontiers, which have &s;o long been expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t horrid barbarities of mercile&s;s &s;a|vages, are now become peaceable habitations.&mdash;How amazingly does the country populate! The inhabitants enlarge their borders almo&s;t from &s;ea to &s;ea, and from the river to the ends of the earth&mdash;When recollecting the hi&s;tory hereof, it &s;hou'd be our chief view and aim to di&s;cover the greatne&s;s and glory of the works of GOD. To di&s;re|gard his providential operations, is a &s;in of the deepe&s;t dye. None but the mo&s;t &s;tupid or abandoned of mankind, will be guilty of &s;uch infatuation.</P>
<P>GOD's awful &s;everity is al&s;o held up to view in this di&s;cour&s;e&mdash;&s;e|verity upon the heathens, whom the LORD hath wonderfully dimi|n &s;hed and de&s;troyed, their name and memory is almo&s;t peri&s;hed from the earth. <HI>Of how much &s;orer puni&s;hment &s;hall we be thought worthy, if we trample, as under our feet, the Son of GOD, and count the blood of the covenant an unholy thing, doing de&s;pite to the &s;pirit of grace?

When we con&s;ider the numerous tribes GOD has de&s;troyed&mdash;how they have peri&s;hed:&mdash;that if we &s;in, it is at a dearer rate than they have done&mdash;and as our &s;ins will be more aggravated &s;o will our puni&s;hment&mdash;if tho&s;e died without mercy what will be our doom? We &s;hall peri&s;h from off this good land&mdash;and &s;ink into mi|&s;ery infinitely deeper and more dreadful than we can conceive of. Fear as well as love &s;hould excite us to &s;erve the LORD. The&s;e are powerful motives of action in the human mind, and &s;hou'd this day have their influence on our minds&mdash;numberle&s;s are the motives, hea|ven hath e&s;pecially &s;et before us, to excite us to a con&s;cientious ob|&s;ervance of duty. If we have any regard for the glory of GOD, our own comfort here and hereafter, or for our tender offspring and po&s;|terity, we mu&s;t &s;erve the LORD. We cannot plead, to extenuate our guilt, that we have not known our LORD's will, as revealed by his word and wonderful works. Tho&s;e heathen, whom GOD hath driven out from before us, will ri&s;e up in judgment again&s;t us, if we live without GOD and CHRIST in the world, de&s;pi&s;ing go&s;pel light and grace.</P>

<P N="4">4. LET us lament the crying &s;ins of the pre&s;ent day. America was &s;ought at fir&s;t and &s;ettled, as an a&s;ylum for liberty civil and reli|gious. Regard for GOD, religion and liberty brought our forefathers hither: and how &s;trict were they in family religion and government&mdash;in attendance upon public wor&s;hip and go&s;pel ordinances: and in all their moral behaviour&mdash;profanene&s;s and intemperance were not practi&s;ed by them. But alas! how are the times changed! GOD hath put us into the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this land; though eve|ry thing is not as we could wi&s;h; yet we are freed from tho&s;e di&s;|tre&s;&s;es they endured. Do we walk humbly and thankfully before and with our GOD? Doth not iniquity abound and the love of ma|ny wax cold? What divi&s;ions in church and &s;tate? Some wou'd &s;ubject them&s;elves to that yoke which neither we nor our fathers were able to bear. Our privileges, favours and ble&s;&s;ings are dear bought. They may be look'd upon and prized by us, as flowing to us, in that crim&s;on tide, which gu&s;hed from the great IMMANUEL'S veins. Shall we dare to &s;in away tho&s;e precious privileges, which our glorious REDEEMER expended his blood to procure?&mdash;We may al&s;o look upon the&s;e privileges as handed down to us, through the blood of our <HI>fore-fathers.</HI> How inexcu&s;ably and aggravatedly guilty are the inhabitants of this land, if they refu&s;e or neglect to know and &s;erve the LORD GOD of their fathers. Did the fir&s;t <HI>planters,</HI> from before whom GOD drove out the Aboriginals, appear in any thing, to be over-rigid and &s;evere, as if they retained &s;omething of that old leaven of per&s;ecution from which they fled? Yet, certainly their general character was that of <HI>eminently pious chri&s;tians.</HI> Loo&s;e principles and loo&s;e practices are too prevalent with the pre&s;ent ge|neration. Are the&s;e the de&s;cendants of tho&s;e noble worthies? How degenerate!</P>
<P>FINALLY, let us break off our &s;ins by repentance and return to GOD through JESUS CHRIST. We have dangerous and threatening &s;ymptoms upon us; among which this is one. that &s;ome appear to &s;et light by tho&s;e ine&s;timable privileges of a civil and religious na|ture,

which we enjoy, <HI>Remember from whence we are fallen, repent and do the fir&s;t works</HI>&mdash;Begin at home fir&s;t. Mankind are apt to &s;ay &s;uch and &s;uch are vile: there is a profane per&s;on; there is a &s;ab|bath breaker, or an intemperate wretch, &amp;c;. Begin with thy&s;elf.&mdash;Which of the divine commands have you not broken, in thought, word or deed, and are daily breaking? Hereby thou do&s;t bear apart, in pulling down, as with violent hands, the vengeance of heaven. Let every one repent, &s;aying what have I done? <HI>Fear</HI> GOD <HI>and ho|nour the King.</HI> We mu&s;t know GOD &s;o as to love and &s;erve him, as an holy, ju&s;t and righteous being: con&s;ecrating our time, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> and our all to his prai&s;e and glory: living by the faith of the &s;on of GOD.<HI>It is high time to wake out of &s;leep and put on the</HI> LORD JESUS&punc; <HI>Now is the accepted time and now the day of &s;alvation.

Our fathers, who fir&s;t &s;ettled this country&punc; <HI>where are they?</HI> Having &s;erved their generation, according to the will of GOD, they are fallen a&s;leep. We mu&s;t quickly lie down alike in the du&s;t&mdash;Let us live as pilgrims and &s;trangers here&mdash;&s;eeking an heavenly country&mdash;as people profe&s;&s;ing godline&s;s and under the be&s;t advantages and &s;tronge&s;t obligations to practi&s;e that righteou&s;ne&s;s which exalteth a nation. Wherefore repent and be converted.&mdash;<Q>In point of duty, gratitude and intere&s;t, we are under infinite obligations to love GOD and live to him. God is infinitely wor|thy of our &s;upreme love and entire obedience, as he is by nature GOD.</Q> And every motive from heaven, earth and hell con&s;pires to urge duty upon us. To continue in &s;in, is to de&s;pi&s;e GOD&punc; CHRIST and heavenly joys; yea, and to be &s;tupid to our own pre|&s;ent intere&s;t and comfort. Abandon a I &s;in&mdash;&s;tand fa&s;t in the liberty wherewith CHRIST hath, made us free. Abu&s;e not tho&s;e precious privileges&mdash;may GOD continue them and we perpetuate the memory of them&mdash;May we, through grace, educate here for a ble&s;&s;ed im|mortality; tran&s;mitting to po&s;terity, this fair inheritance and the&s;e privileges unimpair'd. When we are gathered to our fathers, may there be here a generation to &s;erve the LORD: and when CHRIST who is the believers life, &s;hall appear to judge the world, with all his &s;aints around him, may we appear with him in glory.</P>
