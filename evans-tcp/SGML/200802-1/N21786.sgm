<P>AN hone&s;t man is a character more frequent|ly claimed than de&s;erved. But of all claims, that of a calumniator is one of the mo&s;t unfounded. The pen of in&s;piration has left a &s;tigma on the evil of de|traction. It is condemned by the voice of nature, and the verdict of rea&s;on. Whether it is vented by the tongue, the pen, or the pre&s;s; whether it is con|veyed under the di&s;gui&s;e of dark in&s;inuation, affected &s;ilence, or the contumelious brow; whether it ari&s;es from competitions of honour, or the jealou&s;ies of in|tere&s;t from prejudice, or rancorous pa&s;&s;ion; or is retailed only for amu&s;ement, to &s;upply the vacancy of rea&s;on, or the barrenne&s;s of conver&s;ation; from whatever &s;ource it &s;prings, whatever form it a&s;&s;umes,

or however confined in its walks, &s;lander is a crime of the deepe&s;t dye, ba&s;e in it&s;elf, and baneful to &s;o|ciety. But if &s;uch is the criminality of "&s;peaking evil one of another" in the circle of private life, what is their crime <HI>"who dare to &s;peak evil of digni|ties?" Pre&s;umptuous and &s;elf willed are they</HI> called, and in company joined with characters of &s;uch infamy, that the mo&s;t copious language on earth, under the control of genius and in&s;piration, was found too barren to de&s;cribe them, without the aid of meta+phors, the mo&s;t degrading that could be borrowed from Heaven, Earth, and Sea.</P>
<P><HI>"Fallen angels, wandering &s;tars, raging waves of the &s;ea, foaming our their own &s;hame, filthy dreamers, &s;pots and blemi&s;hes in &s;ociety, trees twice dead, cur&s;ed children, brute bea&s;ts made to be taken and de&s;troy|ed,"</HI> with &s;uch company are <HI>they</HI> ranked <HI>who de&s;pi&s;e government.</HI> And is there not a cau&s;e amply &s;uffi|cient to ju&s;tify this marked di&s;tinction between evil &s;peaking in common, and <HI>&s;peaking evil of dignities?</HI> An attempt to inve&s;tigate this di&s;tinction, while it di|ver&s;ifies a common topic, will perhaps &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome u&s;eful ob&s;ervations on civil government. I feel on this occa&s;ion, the want of more than all the apologies that have ever been made in this place: but to a&s;k the candour and patience of &s;uch an audience as this, might be <HI>"to &s;peak evil of dignities;"</HI> and to &s;peak evil, is in the original Greek, to <HI>bla&s;pheme;</HI> to open the mouth again&s;t the civil magi&s;trate, the vicegerent of God on earth, is <HI>"to &s;et <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> again&s;t heaven."</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="028686_0006_0FDA52096ED24460">
The word, <HI>dignities,</HI> is here taken in the ab&s;tract, and &s;ignifies political authority; in the concrete it is put for per&s;ons exerci&s;ing power and juri&s;diction. While it extends to all the grades and departments of public office, it &s;trongly implies, that all men in pub|lic office <HI>ought</HI> to be men of dignity. But who are the&s;e dignities? What is that government which can|not be &s;poken again&s;t, without incurring the guilt of bla&s;phemy, and the penalty of damnation? The an|&s;wer is plain: That government, which the Apo&s;tle calls <HI>an ordinance of God,</HI> is a government cho&s;en by the people; for he as expre&s;sly calls it <HI>the ordinance of man.</HI> Rulers are <HI>mini&s;ters ordained of God,</HI> only when they are the <HI>mini&s;ters of good to the people.</HI> Obedience therefore, to civil rulers impo&s;ed on the people, or to any <HI>form</HI> or <HI>admini&s;tration</HI> of govern|ment contrary to the will of the people, was never inculcated by the in&s;pired Apo&s;tle on pain of damna|tion: for the &s;ame authority which in this in&s;tance condemns, in others ju&s;tifies open re&s;i&s;tance and op|po&s;ition to government. The unrea&s;onable humour of Ahab King of I&s;rael, the menacing edicts of Ne|buchadnezzar, and the peremptory mandate of the Egyptian Monarch were di&s;regarded with impunity, and even without blame. Was it a crime in Hu&s;hai to develop the machinations of Ahitophel? or did Mordecai &s;peak evil of dignities when he expo&s;ed the plot of Haman again&s;t the whole nation of the Jews? If Sir Edmund Andro&s;s is a tyrant, if Arnold is a traitor, or even Lord Bacon is the bribed Judge, let their villany be unma&s;ked, let their guilt be un|kennelled.
<PB N="8" REF="028686_0007_0FDA520A5CAEA6C0">
To do this every citizen is bound by pri|or and &s;uperior claims of &s;ociety. Should the high|e&s;t officer of any government on earth, flagrantly abu&s;e the authority of his &s;tation, even by pro&s;ecut|ing private de&s;igns, or by adopting public mea&s;ures ho&s;tile to the public good, it is not a crime, but the duty of a free people to be free enough to &s;peak evil of him. The tongue in this ca&s;e is the proper weapon to cha&s;ti&s;e and re&s;train, where the laws of men can|not reach. This will keep the public mind awake, by adding &s;timulus to ardour and information.</P>
<P>Hence we conclude, that &s;peaking evil of digni|ties is a crime on the &s;uppo&s;ition only, that rulers are both the choice and mini&s;ters of good to the peo|ple. When this is a fact, tho&s;e words of the Apo&s;tle which &s;eem to carry horror in their &s;ound, do not exaggerate its criminality. This will appear both from the nature and de&s;ign of government, and from the duties and character of its officers.</P>
<P>In man, the noble&s;t work of God on earth, three worlds co-exi&s;t: The material, animal and angelic; or <HI>&s;pirit, &s;oul and body.</HI> The&s;e are all governed by Deity, in a manner wi&s;ely adapted to their different natures and capacities. The material world is gov|erned by irre&s;i&s;tible force, the brute creation by in&s;tinct, man by law, he alone is endued with moral life, united with the animal and intellectual. This triple life, which combines all the known powers of nature, renders man a moral agent; amenable to God
<PB N="9" REF="028686_0008_0FDA520D22C58128">
the moral governor of the world. With the angel and the brute in his compo&s;ition, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es power and propen&s;ity to do wrong as well as right. This renders him a fit &s;ubject of civil government. The impul&s;es of animal nature render it nece&s;&s;ary, and the &s;ocial principle makes it agreeable, as the author of the&s;e powers, God him&s;elf is the author of government.</P>
<P>To that a&s;toni&s;hing variety in his compo&s;ition, which renders man a proper &s;ubject, we may add, the &s;till greater variety, vi&s;ible in the human genius and di&s;po&s;ition, which demon&s;trates the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ubordination. Different &s;tations in life require dif|ferent talents and qualifications. If every man had the &s;ame degree of ta&s;te, of rea&s;on, or education, which are the portion of a few individuals, how wretched would be the lot of tho&s;e who occupy the lowe&s;t offices, and perform the drudgeries of life. A &s;ublime genius, a refined imagination, without an object, or the po&s;&s;ibility of gratification, would &s;erve only to tantalize and torment the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. Such is the difference of intellectual abilities among men, that the condition of an ox or an a&s;s, endued with &s;ome human intellect, would not be more wretched, perhaps, than that of &s;ome philo&s;ophic genius de&s;tin|ed only to drive them. This diver&s;ity of genius, which is independently the gift of providence, plain|ly indicates the nece&s;&s;ity of tho&s;e di&s;tinctions in life, which are implied in government; it &s;hews moreo|ver, the wi&s;dom and benevolence of the deity, in providing for all, in &s;uch manner, as proves at once
<PB N="10" REF="028686_0009_0FDA5210575B62A8">
the indi&s;pen&s;ability of every man in &s;ociety; and that the poore&s;t in his humble condition may be as u&s;eful, contented and happy as the riche&s;t and mo&s;t elevated officer of government.</P>
<P>Again&mdash;The &s;ignatures of &s;ubordination are legi|ble in the human form. We behold in the counte|nance of &s;ome per&s;ons a kind of dignity, which at once beams reverence, and de&s;ignates for dominion: in others, we ob&s;erve &s;uch vacancy and pro&s;tration of dignity, as equally marks them for &s;ubjection. This diver&s;ity, altho it may ari&s;e in part from the original con&s;titution of the mind, or from moral cul|ture and improvement, is &s;o con&s;picuous and capti|vating, as none will affirm, that the elevated &s;tature of King Saul, the beauty of Ab&s;alom's per&s;on, the rud|dy complexion of David, and the ennobling form of Wa&s;hington, had no &s;hare in rai&s;ing them up to the highe&s;t &s;tations in life.</P>
<P>There is yet another proof of the divine authority of government, and that is the manner in which we come into exi&s;tence. Had this been, like the original pair of our race, in a &s;tate of adult maturity and in|dependence, it would have been, perhaps, more diffi|cult to reduce fallen men to a &s;tate of government than the mo&s;t &s;avage bea&s;ts, <HI>"which are tamed, and have been tamed of mankind."</HI> But, happy for us, a different plan has been adopted. By a law of nature we all begin to exi&s;t in a &s;tate of helple&s;s infancy, un|der the entire control and direction of parents. By
<PB N="11" REF="028686_0010_0FDA5211B74402A0">
this means children early become members of a fa|mily, which is it&s;elf an empire in miniature. Having formed in the moulding age of life, proper ideas and habits of government, they become at length prepar|ed for civil &s;ociety, in larger communities. While this benevolent law of nature announces government coeval with our exi&s;tence, it &s;peaks louder than the tongue of men or angels, the nece&s;&s;ity of early edu|cation. Her voice to legi&s;lators is, "depend not on the number of your laws, or the &s;everity of fines and puni&s;hments; but <HI>lay the axe at the root</HI> of vice, take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heart, and charm, if po&s;&s;ible, the young &s;tranger to the love of virtue and coun|try, in the tendere&s;t period of life. Do this, by giving birth and energy to every po&s;&s;ible in&s;titution for the education of youth." <HI>It teaches</HI> parents al&s;o, the mini&s;ters of religion and others, that while employ|ed in the humble office of in&s;tructing youth, their &s;ervices may be as patriotic, and perhaps more u&s;e|ful to their country, than the wi&s;dom of their coun|&s;els in the &s;enate, or the valour of their arms in the field. In fine, while <HI>it teaches</HI> all this, it <HI>&s;hews,</HI> that to de&s;pi&s;e government is to violate a law of nature.</P>
<P>But in &s;till blacker colours does this crime appear, if we con&s;ider the de&s;ign of government, and the manner in which it is &s;upported. Its benevolent de&s;ign embraces the greate&s;t good of the whole com|munity. But this can be effected in that way only which GOD him&s;elf has taken, both to in&s;truct man|kind, and to govern the world. His will is taught us
<PB N="12" REF="028686_0011_0FDA5217D5079350">
in the &s;acred &s;criptures, not in detail, but by general rules. In like manner GOD governs the world by the laws of a general providence. The&s;e laws are calculated to &s;ecure the good of the whole. They mu&s;t therefore, equally affect each individual com|prehended under them, without any di&s;tinction of per&s;onal circum&s;tance or character. Should the thunderbolt be diverted in its cour&s;e, or &s;topped in its career, contrary to the fixed laws of electricity, to &s;ave one u&s;eful citizen, why not to &s;ave another? <HI>"But &s;hall the earth be for&s;aken, or the rock moved out of its place for thee?"</HI> This would introduce &s;uch a train of miraculous events, as would &s;ubvert the whole con&s;titution of nature, and de&s;troy that e&s;|tabli&s;hed connexion between cau&s;e and effect, which is now the principal &s;ource of human knowledge and fore&s;ight.</P>
<P>Analogous to this divine model, all human govern|ments mu&s;t be con&s;tructed and maintained; i. e. by general laws; laws adapted to the &s;tate and happine&s;s of men collectively. That endle&s;s variety in the con|dition and circum&s;tances of individuals who compo&s;e by a community, renders it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ecure by gen|eral laws, the good of the whole, without injury or in|convenience to &s;ome individuals. An attempt to avoid, by particular laws, the jarring claims, and infinite col|li&s;ions of intere&s;t, which happen in &s;ociety, would be perfectly nugatory. GOD him&s;elf has not done it. Inattention to this &s;ubject has been the unhappy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, not only of &s;trong prejudices again&s;t the book
<PB N="13" REF="028686_0012_0FDA521943411588">
of GOD, but of bold cen&s;ures again&s;t GOD and man. Under a mi&s;take of this kind, the friends of Job cen|&s;ured an innocent man. Is it not owing to this, more than to any other cau&s;e, that men &s;o often <HI>&s;peak evil of dignities?</HI> Ob&s;erving that &s;ome exi&s;ting law is le&s;s favorable to their own private intere&s;t, than to that of &s;ome others, or than different regulations might be, they at once let loo&s;e the tongue of cen&s;ure again&s;t them; not con&s;idering perhaps, not knowing, that the very law which would plea&s;e them might injure, if not ruin thou&s;ands. Let us further ob&s;erve, that the &s;ame object in view, when the legi&s;lator frames a law, ought to be in his eye, when the penalty is affix|ed; that is, the general good: In order to which, he will con&s;ider that moral evil is e&s;timated by the intention of the agent; political evil by its con&s;e|quences in &s;ociety. Human laws cannot reach the heart; the cognizable actions therefore, of men in &s;ociety, mu&s;t be e&s;timated in the ab&s;tract only; as &s;uch they are denominated political crimes, varying in magnitude, according to their tendency or general con&s;equences to the community; that is, in propor|tion to the inten&s;ity and extent of mi&s;ery that would follow, if all actions of that de&s;cription were to be generally tolerated, or become common.</P>
<P>By this &s;tandard the penalty of every law &s;hould be adju&s;ted; and not by the &s;uppo&s;ed moral evil of the action, which cannot be known, nor by its particular con&s;equences to a few individuals, which cannot be regarded, but by its general effects on &s;ociety. This
<PB N="14" REF="028686_0013_0FDA521E91927578">
is the pole &s;tar of every &s;tate&s;man; by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight of which only it is that we can account for the capital puni&s;hment of Uzzah for touching the ark, the zeal of Saint Paul in ab&s;taining from meat, and the nece&s;|&s;ity of &s;evere puni&s;hments for burglary, counterfeit|ing money, running contraband goods, exercitual de|&s;ertion for cowardice, and many other actions, which in them&s;elves appear &s;mall offences, if not innocent or indifferent.&mdash;Inattention to this principle, it is pre&s;umed, has been the fruitful &s;ource of great mi&s;demeanors and public di&s;turbance. Can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the late in&s;urgents in a &s;outhern &s;tate would have refu&s;ed the payment of a &s;mall exci&s;e, had they con&s;idered, that the general con&s;equence of that refu&s;al was the certain lo&s;s of all public rev|enue, and the final &s;ubver&s;ion of all government?&mdash;From the &s;ame cau&s;e, have we not &s;een, what human|ity ever blu&s;hes to relate, a reputed hone&s;t man, in open town-meeting, hold up his hand to defraud the public, or a public creditor, who would not, &s;carcely for his right hand, have been &s;een to injure one of his neighbours?</P>
<P>Inattention, permit me to &s;ay, is the be&s;t apology I can make for numbers of my fellow-citizens who neglect public wor&s;hip, perform journeys, and un|nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s on the LORD's Day. They do not con&s;ider, that if every other per&s;on, who had an e|qual right and the &s;ame excu&s;e, &s;hould follow the example, public wor&s;hip, that great pillar of civil go|vernment, would be entirely overthrown. But
<PB N="15" REF="028686_0014_0FDA522041206808">
more than all, this principle now unfolds its chief de|&s;ign, and &s;hews, as with a &s;un beam, the enormity of reviling dignities. A ruler is the father of his coun|try; he &s;tands at the head of government, at the helm of the &s;hip, in which our lives and fortunes are all em|barked. An attack upon him may &s;ink the whole. Slander in this in&s;tance, is more then death; it is par|ricide, more fatal than all the malignant influences once a&s;cribed to baleful comets, which &s;pread plagues and de&s;olations through a whole country.</P>
<P>But if we con&s;ider civil rulers in character of real dignities, it will &s;trike a deeper <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of guilt and ba&s;ene&s;s into the crime.</P>
<P>If it could be &s;aid of <HI>David,</HI> on account of the digni|ty and importance of his public character, that <HI>he was with</HI> 10,000 <HI>of the people;</HI> was it not a greater crime <HI>to &s;peak evil of &s;uch a "dignity,"</HI> than of another man? Dignity is oppo&s;ed to meanne&s;s. It can be applied to no action but what is virtuous, and therefore to no being on earth but man. To him it is applied in point of character, &s;entiment and behaviour, all which in &s;ome degree, mu&s;t unite in a man of dignity. But to form a ruler of that de&s;cription, he ought to be&mdash;1&s;t. a man of a good di&s;cernment and information. Great talents, and erudition may be indi&s;pen&s;able in the learned profe&s;&s;ions, and in the pretorean department of a go|vernment, in which the people are governed by laws and not men. The police of &s;ome nations may in|deed, be a &s;cience of opero&s;e attainment; but the ad|mini&s;tration
<PB N="16" REF="028686_0015_0FDA5225B369E550">
of a government, &s;imple in its &s;tructure and formed as our own is, by the common &s;en&s;e of a free, virtuous people, cannot be a &s;ubject of va&s;t depth or difficulty. Where men have hone&s;ty enough, they rarely will want &s;kill enough, to guide well the affairs of &s;tate. The human body is &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ed chiefly by common food. This is the mo&s;t ea&s;i|ly obtained and the mo&s;t whole&s;ome, otherwi&s;e it would not have been <HI>common.</HI> The grand object, let us remember, as well as name of our government, is the <HI>"Common-wealth."</HI> It mu&s;t however, be granted, that the &s;malle&s;t acce&s;&s;ion of knowledge adds to ev|ery character a dignity which is felt; and were it not for envy, would be acknowledged by all. Chil|dren &s;oon feel the &s;uperiour authority, it gives a pa|rent even in the government of a family. Rulers may not all be men of &s;cience, but if they are not men <HI>"who have under&s;tanding in the times, and know what I&s;real ought to do,</HI> it is at the ri&s;que of both of their country, and their own reputation, as dignities. 2d. <HI>meekne&s;s of wi&s;dom,</HI> a cool di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate temper, is a di&s;tingui&s;hed trait in the character of official dig|nity. The greate&s;t legi&s;lator was the meeke&s;t man on earth. It was an exce&s;s of diffidence in Mo&s;es; to decline, for want of abilities, the office of an em|ba&s;&s;ador to a royal court. But it rai&s;es in the mind an idea of greater dignity, than the conduct of that a&s;piring young man, who &s;poke the real &s;enti|ments of others, be&s;ides his own, when he &s;aid, <HI>"O that I were made ruler in the land, that every man who hath any &s;uit or cau&s;e, might come to me and I</HI>

<HI>would do him ju&s;tice!</HI> Hypocrites may be found in politics, as well as in divinity. With patrioti&s;m on the tongue, there may be faction or tyranny in the heart. High preten&s;ions of friend&s;hip to the rights of man, attended with bitter criminations of men in public office, ought never to be admitted as a te&s;t of &s;incerity, or of real qualifications for office; becau&s;e great zeal and o&s;tentation are &s;eldom united with that cool di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate temper which is always nece&s;&s;ary to form a ju&s;t opinion upon any &s;ubject.

The medium has a property &s;trange and unknown in optics. It di&s;|torts and di&s;colours, magnifies and dimini&s;hes every object at the &s;ame time. The ra&s;h policy of boi&s;|terous men at the helm of Government has been compared to a whirlwind at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ea. When it happens to blow the right way, it may drive the &s;hip from rocks or &s;hoals, and &s;ave the cargo. But tornadoes are always dangerous to navigation.</P>
<P>To this cool di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate temper we mu&s;t unite, 3d. re&s;olution and intrepidity of mind; for this gives great dignity and elevation to a ruler. Un|moved by the fawnings of flattery or the &s;our &s;cowls of ambition, deaf to the croaking of anarchy and blind to the &s;plendid baits of monarchy, he will no|bly dare to &s;peak his opinion, and act with firmne&s;s and deci&s;ion. Like a rock in the mid&s;t of the o|cean, he &s;tands un&s;haken. The waves of violence, of

intrigue and faction may ri&s;e, foam and roar again&s;t him, but da&s;h and die at his feet. This firmne&s;s of mind is directly oppo&s;ed to that indeci&s;ive temper, by which &s;ome are perpetually <HI>halting between two opinions,</HI> without forming any at all. It &s;tands op|po&s;ed al&s;o to another temper, which may be called deci&s;ion in exce&s;s, a rapid rotation of opinion.&mdash;Men of this ca&s;t decide in &s;uch ha&s;te, and with &s;o lit|tle di&s;cretion, that <HI>they are given to change;</HI> vibrat|ing from one &s;ide to the other, that we know not where to find them. <HI>"A double minded man is un&s;table in all his ways, un&s;table as water he &s;hall not excel."</HI> There is another contra&s;t of this mental fortitude, and that is ductility of mind; this renders the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or too ob&s;equious to flattery, to the lure of intere&s;t and popularity; too prone to be duped by the intrigues of di&s;affected a&s;piring men. Whatever may be the real cau&s;e or compo&s;ition of the&s;e different tempers, certain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> is, that the indeci&s;ive character, a bivious mind, and the ductile temper, all dimini&s;h dignity; and di&s;qualify men for public office.</P>
<P>Firmne&s;s of mind mu&s;t be accompanied with, 4th. con&s;ideration; for this, when united as commonly it is with indu&s;try and a public &s;pirit, is one of the mo&s;t prominent and plea&s;ing features in the whole character of dignity. With what mild and gentle rays it &s;hines through the characters of David, Solo|mon and a Wa&s;hington, and gives them more real dignity, than all the dazzling &s;plendours of a throne? This will &s;often the &s;plendors of their &s;ta|tions, and give them an affable deportment, a com|placency

of behaviour, and &s;uch conciliating man|ners, as cannot fail to &s;ecure the mo&s;t commanding influence over the people.&mdash;In this way the greate&s;t monarch of the earth governed <HI>men, who were in debt, in di&s;tre&s;s, and di&s;contented.</HI> There our exa&s;|perated &s;pirits, bankrupts, and broken fortunes, who had no intere&s;t in the welfare of the country, he influ|enced into one common concern for its property.&mdash;Such a motley ma&s;s of di&s;cordant materials he knead|ed up, into one u&s;eful harmonious compound! It is a unanimous vote in our world, never to re&s;pect, but always to de&s;pi&s;e a haughty di&s;po&s;ition. This di&s;|po&s;ition once degraded from his throne, the royal brute of Babylon, and turned him out a grazing with the bea&s;ts of the field! it &s;unk another as low in the eyes of millions, when in the haughtine&s;s of his &s;pirit, he &s;aid "I will bring all America to my feet." <HI>Pride goeth before de&s;truction, and a haughty &s;pirit</HI> is the fall of dig|nity. How unrea&s;onable in a ruler as well as degrading is &s;uch a temper? What has he that he did not receive? Is he &s;uperior to others in the dignity of his per&s;on? GOD is the author of his frame. Has he more of|ficial dignity? It is derived from the &s;overeignty of the people. Does he &s;hine in the mo&s;t elevated &s;ta|tions? Like the moon he &s;hines only in borrowed light. We do not particularly mention ju&s;tice, hu|manity and patrioti&s;m, becau&s;e they are all included in 5th. "Religion" which above all, gives to a ruler the highe&s;t dignity of character. The patriarchal benediction truly applies to religion alone: <HI>"thou art the excellency of dignity and the excellency of pow|er."</HI>

This refines, enables and animates all the features that compo&s;e dignity, both of character and office.&mdash;Emancipated from inglorious pa&s;&s;ions and pur&s;uits, which rob me of all true honour, religion plants in the heart &s;uch undi&s;&s;embled virtue and piety, as will en&s;ure re&s;pect and reverence, even to men of the low|e&s;t rank, but in men appointed to move in the high|er &s;pheres of life, religion ca&s;ts a lu&s;tre on their elevat|ed &s;eats, and "by a &s;trong reflection doubles the beams of dignity."

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS:</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Rulers are involved in the guilt of &s;lander, when their conduct affords a ju&s;t occa&s;ion for the people to &s;peak evil of them. Can it be po&s;&s;ible, that a legi&s;|lator &s;hould enter the walls of the Senate, and under the &s;olemnities of an oath, there give his voice and &s;anction to a law which he &s;acredly commits to the

Is it a crime to &s;peak evil of &s;uch dignities? there is no dignity in &s;uch men. Vice is eternally mean. 2d. The charac|ter given of a ruler, leads us to decide a long con|troverted que&s;tion, re&s;pecting the be&s;t form of civil policy, in favor of a free republic. I mean "a demo|cratical ari&s;tocracy, re&s;ting on the free election of the people, and revocable at plea&s;ure."&mdash;The &s;trength and glory of &s;uch a republic depend on the virtue of the people, which is real dignity. That of monarchy is &s;upported by the glare of earthly grandeur, by the pageantry of heroi&s;m, and the weapons of death, which is royal dignity. This intoxicates the &s;en&s;es, but the other touches the heart. Hence a republican form was the choice and fabric of GOD him&s;elf for his own people. Mo&s;es with a &s;enate of &s;eventy, &s;hared the government of I&s;real. The nature of man, the character of chri&s;tian rulers, above all the benev|olent principles of liberty and equality, embo&s;omed in the religion of JESUS, are congenial to no other form; at lea&s;t they appear incompatible with mo|narchical principles and the dyna&s;ty of kings. 3d&mdash;The advocated principle of calculating laws to em|brace the aggregate &s;um of happine&s;s in a commu|nity, &s;hews the ab&s;urdity of that doctrine, which maintains that moral evil is political good; or that private vice is public virtue. Were this a fact, it would be the duty of legi&s;lators <HI>to e&s;tabli&s;h iniquity by law,</HI> i. e. they ought to enact laws to encourage

<P>1&s;t. The palladium of Liberty may pull down the pillars of freedom. A licentious pre&s;s, like the unru|ly tongue, is full of deadly poi&s;on. It &s;ows the &s;eeds of di&s;cord, and &s;aps the foundation of all government. By corrupting the &s;ource of public information, it be|comes the bane both of private and &s;ocial felicity.

<P>2d. Whatever tends to de&s;troy or dimini&s;h an e|qual voice in elections, will endanger the immunities of a people. A&s;&s;ociations of every de&s;cription, whe|ther civil or eccle&s;ia&s;tical, whether &s;elf-created or &s;anctioned by government or by the god of nature, all tend to create in the mind certain bya&s;&s;es and at|tachments which produce an accretion of power and influence in future elections; nor can this be avoid|ed without eradicating the principles of human na|ture. The exi&s;tence of &s;ociety depends on this principle; &s;imilar effects will ari&s;e from a natural &s;uperiority of genius, from greater acqui&s;itions in knowledge, in wealth and in the arts of addre&s;s. The Deity never intended a perfect equality among men, not even in their elective power. This would have been a &s;car, if not a &s;oleci&s;m in the analogy of nature. This however, bears no proportion to that inequality which prevails among de&s;potic nations, and which ought to be con&s;idered as the horror of all free gov|ernments. In nature we always ob&s;erve variety, but we &s;eldom find extremes. The beauty and utility of the human hand, that badge of human authority, would &s;uffer great diminution, if its fingers were equal, but much more if they were enormous, either in length or &s;ize. It is only from an extreme or a|bu&s;e
<PB N="24" REF="028686_0023_0FDA523736658980">
of this inequality, that danger is apprehended; and over which we ought ever to watch with a jea|lous eye.</P>
<P>3d. National wealth, e&s;pecially when carefully accumulated in the hands of a few individuals, is dan|gerous in the extreme to human liberty. The experi|ence of ages, the repeated admonitions of our Saviour and his apo&s;tles prove beyond a doubt, <HI>the power of riches corrupt the human heart.</HI> Hardly can we find one period of pro&s;perity, in the whole hi&s;tory of the I&s;raelites; or of any other nation on the earth, which has not been followed with a decay of piety, and a corruption of morals. Shall we then rejoice and not tremble, when we &s;ee a profu&s;ion of earthly good; flowing &s;treams of pro&s;perity, in which multitudes are bathing them&s;elves at ea&s;e, while the rapid current is carrying away the liberties of mankind? Opulence is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he common parent of idlene&s;s, luxury and di&s;&s;ipation &amp;c. The reflection of a moment will convince us, that wealth is both the object and principal cau&s;e of <HI>avarice</HI> and <HI>ambition.</HI> The&s;e are the common &s;ources of anarchy and de&s;poti&s;m, and the&s;e again, are the charybdis and &s;cylla of our country&mdash;mo&s;t of the di&s;|putes and quarrels that happen in the world, originate from the idea of property. Savages live in tolera|ble peace almo&s;t without government, becau&s;e they feel not, as we do, the power of wealth. While this attracts the gaze of vulgar admiration, it is apt to &s;well the heart with pride, "that un&s;ocial and unfriendly pa&s;&s;ion," <HI>only by pride cometh contention.</HI> Its influence
<PB N="25" REF="028686_0024_0FDA5238B78BECC8">
on civil elections is &s;till more pernicious. Money is frequently the mo&s;t forcible logic, and he that car|ries the longe&s;t pur&s;e, will often carry the mo&s;t votes. In this view of wealth, we &s;ee and admire the policy as well as ju&s;tice of a late act of our legi&s;|lature, which re&s;cinded an old fragment of monarchy too long worn as the right of primogeniture. We &s;ee al&s;o, and revere the wi&s;dom of GOD in the ap|pointment of a jubilee, as an e&s;&s;ential article in the Jewi&s;h policy. This, it is probable; was the great palladium of liberty to that people. A &s;imilar in|&s;titution perhaps may be the only method in which liberty can be perpetuated among &s;elfi&s;h, degenerate beings in any government under heaven. But a|&s;ide from this, and in full view of the dangers of ex|orbitant wealth, permit me to &s;ay that the prayer of one good man ever ought to be the united prayer of all America, <HI>"give us not riches&mdash;nor poverty."</HI></P>

which from the beginning of creation down to the pre&s;ent time, has been con&s;tantly advancing. By a train of &s;urpri&s;ing events in providence, calculated to throw light upon each other, the public mind in every age, and among all nations, has been gradually opening, <HI>from the father of lights;</HI> as much light and knowledge have been &s;ent down to earth, as the cir|cum&s;tances of its inhabitants would bear. At certain periods however, knowledge on earth, like the heav|enly bodies, has proceeded with unequal velocity; and like them, it has &s;ometimes appeared &s;tationary and even retrograde: but this was in appearance on|ly. Upon the whole it has been progre&s;&s;ive, and will probably continue its progre&s;s, until its final comple|tion in the full effulgence of millennial glory, when <HI>"the earth &s;hall be full of the knowledge of</HI> GOD." Partial interruptions have only paved the way for ac|celerating its progre&s;s.

At lea&s;t, we may hope, that modern poli&s;h of literature will not, <HI>like Pharoh's lean kine,</HI> eat up the more &s;ub&s;tantial parts; and that the time will &s;oon arrive, when four years at a college will not roll away, without con&s;ecrating a portion of it, to the cla&s;&s;ical, &s;cientific &s;tudy of natural hi&s;|tory, and tho&s;e practical principles of chymi&s;try, on which the rationale and improvements of agriculture and the mechanical arts, &s;o much depend; and which at the pre&s;ent day are &s;o highly nece&s;&s;ary to the growth and pro&s;perity of this young American em|pire.

On this account I beg leave to
<PB N="29" REF="028686_0028_0FDA5242A8D7CF80">
&s;ay that the orthography of the Engli&s;h language, in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, is a tax on life, the opprobrium of &s;cience, a load of expen&s;ive lumber on the ten|der minds of millions of our race. In &s;uch a na|tion as this, it is intolerable. I will not think of it, but proceed to a thought more plea&s;ing, 5th. virtue and religion above all are the &s;tronge&s;t pillars of go|vernment. The ma&s;k of hypocri&s;y is a public ac|knowledgment of the worth of religion. The &s;ug|ge&s;tion even of Athei&s;ts, when they dub religion a &s;tate engine to awe men into obedience, is a tacit confe&s;&s;ion of its utility in government. A &s;afe en|gine it is, and of &s;uch force too, that the want, or weakne&s;s of but a &s;ingle &s;pring in it, I mean the be|lief of a future &s;tate, has always proved fatal to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of government over any one whole na|tion on earth. In&s;pectors of the public manners, appointed by the law-givers of antiquity, prove that virtue was e&s;teemed e&s;&s;ential to the pro&s;perity &amp; even exi&s;tence of government. Should we appeal to the records of hi&s;tory&mdash;to that of the Jewi&s;h nation&mdash;to the Egyptians, Per&s;ians, Grecians, Romans, and to mo&s;t of the flouri&s;hing &s;tates in the world, her ver|dict would be in favor of virtue. The interchange of virtue and vice, graduated the &s;cale, by which the wealth, power and re&s;pectability of all nations may be accurately mea&s;ured. Polybius, who a&s;cribes to irreligion the ruin of his own country, which pre|ceded that of Rome, ob&s;erves that a tenfold &s;ecuri|ty given by a Grecian tru&s;tee for a &s;mall &s;um of pub|lic money, was &s;ure to be violated, while the religion
<PB N="30" REF="028686_0029_0FDA5244B75BCC78">
an oath among the Romans was ample &s;ecurity for every engagement. While virtue prevailed in the Roman Empire, her feet in the language of Daniel, were <HI>iron.</HI> But when the people began to degener|ate, the iron began to be mixed with clay. Her feet were broken, and the empire fell.&mdash;In a word, it can no more be doubted that happine&s;s and mi&s;ery of public communities, as well as individuals, are con|nected with virtue and vice, than that gravitation is a property of matter. But if ethical virtue was the exi&s;tence and pro&s;perity of ancient governments, what may not be expected from the pure&s;t &s;y&s;tem of moral virtue ever taught on earth? Compared with this, the fine&s;t morals of Socrates or Confucius, or Plato, or Epictetus, are no more than the light or heat of a glow worm, to that of the meridian &s;un. The religion of nature teaches men to be ju&s;t and righte|ous; but a righteous man is not the character which chri&s;tianity calls a good man. A good man will do <HI>more</HI> than &s;trict ju&s;tice can demand of him; <HI>he will do more than others.</HI> His &s;ervices done for the pub|lic are performed not with &s;ervility, but affection.&mdash;Not merely to e&s;cape cen&s;ure, or for the &s;ake of re|ward, <HI>"but as a &s;ervant of Chri&s;t with good will</HI> to mankind, <HI>doing &s;ervice as unto the Lord, and not to men.</HI> Religion requires tho&s;e <HI>who rule over men to be</HI> more than <HI>ju&s;t;</HI> they mu&s;t <HI>rule in the fear of</HI> GOD: Becau&s;e gods on earth are the &s;ubjects of Heaven, and mu&s;t give an account of their &s;teward|&s;hip to GOD, as well as to men.

The pa&s;&s;ions of the peo|ple are moulded by the inclinations of the great. The actions of rulers, like the rods of Jacob, which he peeled and &s;et before the flocks, will give colour and complexion to all that behold them; yea, more than this, the influence of public example will operate on the people, like the magnetic influ|ence upon iron, which not only attracts or repels, but even communicates its own nature. This theory is authenticated by the mo&s;t &s;triking facts of in&s;pira|tion. "As in water face an&s;wereth to face," &s;o did the character of GOD'S ancient people, both of I&s;rael and Judah, corre&s;pond to that of her rulers. Whether they neglected or attended to religion and the wor|&s;hip of GOD, the people generally followed their example. What a le&s;&s;on is before us! a volume of the mo&s;t &s;erious in&s;truction in a &s;ingle fact. May <HI>"the honourable of the earth"</HI> never forget, that character gives currency as well as dignity to their laws and public admini&s;trations; and while enforced by example, their own exertions to promote piety and morality, indu&s;try and temperance, with all the u&s;eful arts of life, will be productive of the mo&s;t &s;alutary effects.</P>

that the property of numbers among us while they and their families are attending public wor&s;hip on the Lord's Day, is liable to inva&s;ion, from licen|tious neighbours who attend no wor&s;hip at all.&mdash;When the people of I&s;rael left their own habitations and went up to Jeru&s;alem to wor&s;hip, GOD him|&s;elf interpo&s;ed; and by a miracle guarded in their ab&s;ence, the property of his own people again&s;t the rapacity of their enemies.

A &s;avage undi&s;ciplined tongue is more to be dreaded than undi&s;ciplined troops, or the mo&s;t inhuman &s;avage. Sharper than a two edged &s;word, it cuts the bands of love which unite man to man, and thru&s;ts its deadly &s;tab into the bo&s;om of &s;ociety; it is a <HI>pe&s;tilence that walks in darkne&s;s and wa&s;teth at noon day.</HI> When the cau&s;e of liberty bleeds, let the patriotic tongue blow the trumpet, and plead its in|jured rights. Freedom of &s;peech and of the pre&s;s, in &s;uch a cau&s;e, is the terror of tyrants and the &s;courge of anarchy. But when licentious and un|governed, they create jealou&s;ies, infu&s;e &s;u&s;picions, weaken public confidence, kindle, and augment the flames of &s;uch contention, as may de&s;olate a country, and crim&s;on it with blood! While every man claims, as he ju&s;tly may, a right to watch his own government, let him watch his own tongue. In this way the poore&s;t man may plant one of the &s;tronge&s;t guards around the liberties of his country, by that which will co&s;t him nothing, but &s;ilence.
