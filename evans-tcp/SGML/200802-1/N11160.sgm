<Q><HI>And I looked and ro&s;e up, and &s;aid unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the re&s;t of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: Remember the</HI> LORD, <HI>which is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your &s;ons and your daughters, your wives and your hou&s;es.</HI></Q>

<P>WHEN a people become voluntary &s;laves to &s;in; when it is e&s;teemed a reproach to reverence and &s;erve God; when profane|ne&s;s and di&s;&s;olute morals become fa&s;hionable; when pride and luxury predominate, we cannot expect &s;uch a nation to be long happy.</P>
<P>ISRAEL, when fir&s;t planted in the land of Canaan, were a brave, heroic and virtuous people, being firm|ly attached to the true wor&s;hip of God. They were both formidable and invincible: when their armies went forth to battle, thou&s;ands and tens of thou&s;ands fell before them: thus being cloathed with the ma|je&s;ty

of virtue and true religion, a panic &s;eized the hearts of all their enemies around them. But when vice and immorality became prevalent; when they for&s;ook and rebelled again&s;t their God, they lo&s;t their martial &s;pirit, and were &s;oon en&s;laved by the king of Babylon. Yet, as God is gracious and merciful, when &s;eventy years were expired in this furnace of affliction, he remembered their low e&s;tate, and &s;tirred up Cyrus, king of Per&s;ia, to proclaim liberty for the Jews to return and build their temple at Jeru&s;alem. Never|thele&s;s &s;ome of the people &s;till remained in Per&s;ia, of which Nehemiah was one.&mdash;He was a favourite in the days of Artaxerxes the king, therefore he obtained leave to go and build the walls of that antient city Jeru&s;alem. But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite, and Ge&s;hem the Arabian heard that there were men come to &s;eek the welfare of the Jews, they were filled with indignation: therefore, in &s;cornful language, they bring a &s;tate-accu&s;ation again&s;t them, &s;aying: "What is this thing that ye do? will you rebel again&s;t the king<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e three gentlemen were governors, and con&s;equently pen|&s;ioners. It is common for &s;uch to profe&s;s great loyalty to kings, when in reality it is their pen&s;ion they love, and not their king. They &s;peak in court language, "Will ye rebel again&s;t the king?"</NOTE>?" However, though they treated the Jews with &s;corn and in&s;ult, yet their labour became a &s;ubject of conver&s;ation. Sanballat once &s;peak|ing on the occa&s;ion, Tobiah makes a reply to this effect, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> "Tu&s;h, Sanballat, it is not worth your notice, nor &s;hould you give your&s;elf the lea&s;t concern about the&s;e feeble wretches, they build indeed, but if a fox

in his meanders was to a&s;cend their &s;tone wall, and only give a few &s;cratches, it would fall down." The&s;e &s;cornful in&s;ults were &s;poken that the Jews might hear them, and be di&s;couraged; but when they &s;aw that the work went on with rapidity, they were filled with the highe&s;t indignation, and re&s;olved, if bitter taunts, the&s;e &s;words of their mouths, would not di&s;courage them, their &s;words of &s;teel &s;hould compel them to cea&s;e from their work: therefore Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabians, the Ammonites and A&s;hdodites all con&s;pire together, to come with their united force again&s;t Je|ru&s;alem. Their de&s;ign was made known to Nehemiah; and, as all &s;hould do, e&s;pecially in di&s;tre&s;s, he lifts up his eyes to heaven, and makes his &s;upplication to the LORD of ho&s;t; nor does he think his pre&s;ervation &s;hall be effected in neglect of the u&s;e of means; therefore he &s;ets a watch again&s;t them day and night, and addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to all ranks of people in the&s;e &s;pirited and excellent words, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>Be not ye afraid of them: Remember the</HI> LORD, <HI>which is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your &s;ons and your daughters, your wives and your hou&s;es.</HI></P>

<P N="1">1. A caution again&s;t cowardice, or fear of an enemy unju&s;tly enraged. <HI>Be not ye afraid of them.</HI></P>

<P>And la&s;tly, Some inferences &s;hall be drawn.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="014133_0006_0F9330F489E67068">
The &s;ubject before us is of great importance.&mdash;It is to be lamented that we have the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion to con&s;ider it.&mdash;It is very copious, and as it is new to me, brevity and great accuracy can &s;carcely be ex|pected. If GOD &s;hall enable us to con&s;ider each pro|po&s;ition con&s;i&s;tent with his honour, and worthy of his maje&s;ty, we may re&s;t &s;atisfied. Your attention, my Brethren and Countrymen is begged, while an endea|vour is made,</P>
<P>I. To prove, that in &s;ome ca&s;es, when a people are oppre&s;&s;ed, in&s;ulted and abu&s;ed, and can have no other redre&s;s, it then becomes our duty as men, with our eyes to GOD, to fight for our liberties and properties; or in other words, that <HI>a defen&s;ive war is &s;inle&s;s before</HI> GOD; con&s;equently to engage therein, is con&s;i&s;tent with the pure&s;t religion.</P>
<P>If antiquity, if the united voice of all kingdoms, that now or ever have exi&s;ted, could be admitted as a proof, the point would ea&s;ily be determined; for there has been no kingdom, whether compo&s;ed of Jews or Gentiles, Barbarians or Chri&s;tians, but have embraced it as their common creed, that a defen&s;ive war is inno|cent. But though this is a pre&s;umptive argument, yet it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that it is not a deci&s;ive proof: for antient mi&s;takes are mi&s;takes, and a multitude may be wrong.</P>
<P>But if this propo&s;ition can be made appear from the
<PB N="8" REF="014133_0007_0F9330F54C8B7CA0">
holy &s;criptures, as we profe&s;s them to be our only rule of faith and practice, then it mu&s;t be acknow|ledged that a defen&s;ive war is &s;inle&s;s, and con&s;i&s;tent with the pure&s;t religion. To them let us repair with attentive ears, to hear what the lively oracles of GOD will &s;ay on this point.</P>
<P>Among all the antient &s;ervants of GOD none is more famous for true piety and pure religion than the pa|triarch Abraham&mdash;to him the highe&s;t epithets are given&mdash;he is more than once called the friend of GOD&mdash;in his &s;teps the righteous are to walk&mdash;to him were many great and precious promi&s;es made, and yet we find this great, this holy man firmly of the faith that a defen&s;ive war is &s;inle&s;s. He makes a bright di&s;|play of his faith, when the four kings took Lot, his brother's &s;on, captive. Doth his religion prevent his pur&s;uit of the enemy? No, verily. With a heart de|pending on the mo&s;t high GOD, he collects his &s;er|vants and &s;ome confederates; with martial weapons in his hands, he pur&s;ues the foes, and utterly di&s;com|fits the four kings, and triumphantly brings back the captives, with all the &s;poil. This was the very time that Melchizedeck, the prie&s;t of the mo&s;t high GOD, met him. And did he reprove or cur&s;e him? No, &s;ays the text, "he brought forth bread and wine,"&mdash;giving him the highe&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of ap|probation, he thus addre&s;&s;ed him, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <Q>Ble&s;&s;ed be Abraham of the mo&s;t high GOD, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of heaven and earth, and ble&s;&s;ed be the mo&s;t high GOD, which
<PB N="9" REF="014133_0008_0F9330F609AC9000">
hath delivered thine enemies into thine hand.</Q> <HI>Gen.</HI> xiv: 18. 19. 20. This pa&s;&s;age proves not only that this was Abram's belief, but al&s;o that Melchizedek, prie&s;t of the mo&s;t high GOD, Melchizedek, the brighte&s;t type of CHRIST, was fully of the &s;ame opinion, and therefore may be admitted as an evidence in favour of a defen&s;ive war. For any of us to pre&s;ume that we have a better con&s;cience than Melchizedeck, would argue either pride or ignorance.</P>
<P>If we trace the &s;acred hi&s;tory, and de&s;cend to &s;uc|ceeding ages, we &s;hall find that Mo&s;es is of the &s;ame faith. Among all the children of men none was more meek, and admitted to greater familiarity with GOD, than Mo&s;es. He is often called, by way of eminence, "Mo&s;es, the &s;ervant of GOD." By his hands we re|ceived the lively oracles of GOD, and the apo&s;tle bears him witne&s;s, that "he was faithful in all things;" yet we find him often engaged in bloody battles. One in&s;tance may &s;uffice at pre&s;ent, out of many that might be produced, and that is, when, on the mo&s;t rea&s;on|able terms, he reque&s;ts to pa&s;s through the land of Sihon, king of the Amorites, pledging his honour that no damage &s;hould be done; <HI>Num.</HI> xxi: 22. but Sihon, in&s;tead of granting the &s;mall privilege of pa&s;s|ing along the highway, advances with all his armies again&s;t I&s;rael. Doth Mo&s;es think it his duty to make no defence? Let us view his conduct. I&s;rael advances with &s;word in hand, and utterly di&s;comfits the Amo|rites.&mdash;If we read the book of Jo&s;huah, his immediate
<PB N="10" REF="014133_0009_0F9330F6C9C06A08">
&s;ucce&s;&s;or, we &s;hall find him of the &s;ame mind. I&s;rael are called the peculiar people of GOD, to whom his mind was revealed, and this is the faith of the whole hou&s;e of I&s;rael.&mdash;If it was a &s;in to engage in a defen|&s;ive war, can we &s;uppo&s;e that I&s;rael &s;hould be ignorant of it? Seeing therefore that it is &s;inle&s;s, it is meet that we &s;hould tread in the foot&s;teps of this flock, which is gone before us.&mdash;And were we further to attend to the &s;acred hi&s;tory, we &s;hall find, that after the death of Jo&s;huah and the elders, which &s;aw the mighty works of GOD, that I&s;rael fir&s;t being en&s;laved by &s;in, were oppre&s;&s;ed by various nations; but when they cried unto the LORD, he rai&s;ed up deliverers, among whom were Othniel, Ehud, Barak, Gideon, Jephtha, and many others, which performed glorious exploits, and were ble&s;&s;ed in&s;truments under GOD to deliver I&s;rael from oppre&s;&s;ion and bondage. Some of the&s;e, you know, are &s;poken of as the worthies of I&s;rael and have much recorded in their prai&s;e; and yet all the&s;e died in the faith, that a defen&s;ive war is &s;inle&s;s before GOD. Still were we to de&s;cend and pur&s;ue the chain of hi&s;tory, we &s;hall find all the kings of I&s;rael of the &s;ame faith. Among many that might be mentioned, we &s;hall at pre&s;ent take notice only of one. David, a man eminent for pure religion, the &s;weet p&s;almi&s;t of I&s;rael, David, a man after GOD'S own heart, yet all his life is a &s;cene of war. When he was even a youth, he began his martial exploits, and delivered I&s;rael by &s;laying great Goliath of Gath, the champion of the
<PB N="11" REF="014133_0010_0F9330F78C1523C0">
Phili&s;tines. And what &s;hall I &s;ay more? The time would fail me to enumerate all who were avouchers of this propo&s;ition: It is therefore a clear point, that a defen&s;ive war is &s;inle&s;s, and con&s;i&s;tent with the pure&s;t religion.</P>
<P>This indeed is generally acknowledged, when our di&s;pute is with a foreign enemy, but at pre&s;ent it &s;eems like a hou&s;e divided again&s;t it&s;elf; our di&s;pute is with admini&s;tration. This is cau&s;e of great &s;orrow, that &s;uch a heavy judgment has befallen the kingdom; and yet we are not without &s;ome in&s;tances in &s;cripture of people refu&s;ing obedience to kings, when they be|came arbitrary and oppre&s;&s;ive. When Rehoboam threatened I&s;rael with nothing but tyranny, they did not long he&s;itate till they gave the king this an&s;wer, <Q>What portion have we in David? Neither have we inheritance in the &s;on of Je&s;&s;e: To your tents, oh I&s;rael! Now &s;ee to thine own hou&s;e David.</Q> 1 <HI>Kings</HI> xii: 16.</P>
<P>And this certainly has been the faith of Great-Britain, as might be made appear by many in&s;tances, one of which I &s;hall at pre&s;ent ju&s;t mention. When king James II. departed from the con&s;titution, and became arbitrary, by di&s;pen&s;ing with acts of Parlia|ment by proclamation, i&s;&s;uing <HI>quo warrantos</HI> again&s;t charters, and endeavouring to introduce popery, the people e&s;teemed it no &s;in to invite William, the prince of Orange, to invade England, and obliged James to
<PB N="12" REF="014133_0011_0F9330F86BF12158">
abdicate a kingdom he had forfeited his right to govern.</P>
<P>But there are &s;ome texts of &s;cripture urged on this occa&s;ion, which were to be con&s;idered. The following are thought to enjoin non-re&s;i&s;tance in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>Let every &s;oul be &s;ubject to the higher powers: For there is no power but of</HI> GOD; <HI>the powers that be, are ordained of</HI> GOD. <HI>Who&s;oever therefore re&s;i&s;teth the power, re&s;i&s;teth the ordinance of</HI> GOD: <HI>and they that re&s;i&s;t, &s;hall receive to them&s;elves condemnation.</HI> Rom. xiii: 1. 2, &amp;c. The apo&s;tle is no friend to anarchy, for he well knew the corruption and depravity of man would oppre&s;s the innocent, if there were no legal re&s;traints. But, in order rightly to under&s;tand the&s;e words, it is of great importance to determine fir&s;t, what is meant by the <HI>higher powers:</HI> For this is what every &s;oul is to be &s;ubject unto. We &s;hall find no expo&s;ition liable to le&s;s exception, than to under&s;tand by the higher powers the ju&s;t, the good, the whole&s;ome and con&s;titutional laws of a land, merely re&s;pecting civil government. The very de&s;ign of the&s;e higher powers is to &s;ecure the property and promote the happine&s;s of the whole community.&mdash;The&s;e higher powers therefore appear as binding on princes as people. And as GOD has or|dained the&s;e powers for the good of the whole, who|&s;oever re&s;i&s;teth the &s;ame, re&s;i&s;teth the ordinance of GOD, and receiveth finally condemnation, and that ju&s;tly; for anarchy and tyranny are e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame, and equally to be dreaded, as each re&s;i&s;ts the
<PB N="13" REF="014133_0012_0F9330F92A312D90">
higher powers. We cannot &s;uppo&s;e, either that this text enjoins ab&s;olute &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to all laws, which may be made in a land; for &s;ome are &s;o wicked, oppre&s;&s;ive and unju&s;t in their nature and tendency, that the be&s;t of men have thought it their indi&s;pen&s;able duty to di&s;|obey them. You may well remember, that Nebuchad|nezzar made it a certain law, that all nations in his empire &s;hould, on pain of death, wor&s;hip his golden image. Was it the duty of his &s;ubject to obey or not? The conduct of Shadrach, Me&s;hach and Abednego will determine the point, who, refu&s;ing to comply, were ca&s;t into a fiery furnace. Remember al&s;o, when Darius, king of Per&s;ia, made a &s;tatute, that no man &s;hould petition either GOD or man, &s;ave him&s;elf, for thirty days, Daniel refu&s;ed obedience unto the decree, becau&s;e it was unrighteous. Call to mind al&s;o, that in the days of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, he enjoined it as a law to all the midwives, that they &s;hould kill all the male-children of the Jews. Did they obey or not? The text informs us that the fear of GOD prevented them, believing that no law can make that ju&s;t, which in its own nature is unrighteous. The higher powers, of which Paul &s;peaks, are ordained of GOD, and if or|dained of him, they mu&s;t be like unto him, who is a GOD of un&s;potted ju&s;tice and truth. Certain it is, that the people mu&s;t be the judges whether the laws are good or not;&mdash;and I think it mu&s;t be acknowledged by all, that laws are not good, except they &s;ecure every man's liberty and property, and defend the &s;ubject
<PB N="14" REF="014133_0013_0F9330F9CF9D40E0">
again&s;t the arbitrary power of kings, or any body of men what&s;oever.</P>
<P>Again, another text, u&s;ed to enforce the doctrine of non-re&s;i&s;tance in the pre&s;ent di&s;pute, is, <HI>Submit your|&s;elves to every ordinance of man, for the</HI> LORD'S <HI>&s;ake, whether unto the king as &s;upreme, or unto governors as unto them that are &s;ent by him, for the puni&s;hment of evil|doers, and for the prai&s;e of them that do well.</HI> 1 Pet. ii: 13. 14. This text is to be under&s;tood in a re&s;tricted and limited &s;en&s;e as above. We cannot &s;uppo&s;e, that the apo&s;tle meant obedience to all de&s;potic ordinances of tyrants; for this would condemn the conduct of the midwives, Daniel, Shadrach, Me&s;hach and Abednego. The ordinances here can be none other than &s;uch as are good, and ordained of GOD, for who&s;e &s;ake we are to &s;ubmit unto them; for the&s;e higher powers, or ordinances, are the provi&s;ion of GOD, which he has or|dained for the Safety of the people, to defend them again&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion and arbitrary power. There is none, but GOD, &s;uitably qualified to rule according to his own will and plea&s;ure, &s;o that when man a&s;&s;umes to rule arbitrarily, he &s;ets him&s;elf in the temple of GOD, &s;hewing him&s;elf that he is God; for none is qualified for that &s;eat, but him that is infinitly wi&s;e, ju&s;t and holy. We &s;ee, when the&s;e words are taken in a limited &s;en&s;e, there is no evil con&s;equence follows, but if we under&s;tand them to bind us to obey all that ta&s;k|ma&s;ters require, then it is plain that we condemn king Henry VIII. for refu&s;ing obedience to the pope of
<PB N="15" REF="014133_0014_0F9330FB03218768">
Rome. Many <HI>bulls</HI> were thundered out again&s;t him, but he and the parliament re&s;olved that they were a complete legi&s;lative body in them&s;elves, paying no re|gard to the threats of Rome. If we were to embrace any other expo&s;ition of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, we &s;hould ab&s;olutely condemn the Reformation; nay, we would condemn all England, who refu&s;ed obedience to king James II. becau&s;e he would not be &s;ubject to the higher powers, but endeavoured to &s;ubvert the con&s;titution, and to reign arbitrarily. Such a &s;entiment, if pur&s;ued, would lead back to all the horrors of popery and de&s;poti&s;m; nay, it would even condemn the ble&s;&s;ed martyrs, who refu&s;ed obedience to arbitrary and wicked laws.</P>
<P>Some will object, that the&s;e laws re&s;pected religion, which makes an e&s;&s;ential difference; for when religion is affected, one may with&s;tand a kingdom. Calvin and Luther were of this faith. It is granted, that there is great difference between &s;tate affairs and religion; for Chri&s;t &s;ays, "his kingdom is not of this world;" none dare impo&s;e laws in matters of religion on his &s;ubjects, without being guilty of a daring in&s;ult: but the in&s;tances above do not all re&s;pect religion, there|fore are &s;uitable on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion; and tho&s;e that do re&s;pect religion, were brought to prove that the words are to be taken in a re&s;tricted &s;en&s;e. I have met with none, but acknowledge the&s;e texts mu&s;t be &s;o under&s;tood, as to ju&s;tify oppo&s;ition to popi&s;h ty|ranny. And pray, my countrymen, what better is pro|te&s;tant
<PB N="16" REF="014133_0015_0F9330FB5646E568">
tyranny than popi&s;h? Is there any e&s;&s;ential dif|ference between being robbed by a <HI>prote&s;tant</HI> or a papi&s;t? Is it not the very &s;ame thing? Tyranny is tyranny, &s;lavery is &s;lavery, by whom&s;oever it is im|po&s;ed. Names change not the nature of things. If de&s;poti&s;m is bad in a papi&s;t, it cannot be good in a <HI>prote&s;tant.</HI> If it may be re&s;i&s;ted in one, it ought to be in the other.</P>
<P>But to proceed: There is another objection, which good people make again&s;t war of any kind, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <Q>That war is not agreeable to the di&s;po&s;ition of &s;ouls newly converted to the knowledge of CHRIST: Then we long for the &s;alvation of &s;ouls, and have a tender regard for all men: Surely martial en|gagements do not &s;uit a meek and loving di&s;ciple of JESUS.</Q> I confe&s;s, no objection to me is of equal importance to this. It is a &s;olemn con&s;ideration:&mdash;Alas! alas! that ever there was occa&s;ion of even a de|fen&s;ive war: but occa&s;ion there has been, and occa&s;ion there now is.&mdash;The rea&s;on why a defen&s;ive war &s;eems &s;o awful to good people, is, they e&s;teem it to be &s;ome kind of murder: but this is a very great mi&s;take; for it is no more murder than a legal proce&s;s again&s;t a cri|minal. The end is the &s;ame, the mode is different. In &s;ome ca&s;es it is the only mode le&s;t to obtain ju&s;tice. And &s;urely that religion is not from heaven, which is again&s;t ju&s;tice on earth. Remember all men are not converted; if they were, there could be no nece&s;&s;ity of war in any &s;en&s;e. For, &s;ays the &s;cripture, <Q>they &s;hall
<PB N="17" REF="014133_0016_0F9330FC0AD17478">
not hurt nor de&s;troy.</Q> But remember, this is when the earth &s;hall be filled with the knowledge of the LORD. Alas! this is not the ca&s;e now; for darkne&s;s, gloomy darkne&s;s, prevails throughout the kingdoms of this world. Oh! that the kingdom of JESUS was come, when we &s;hould have occa&s;ion to learn war no more. But to give a more particular an&s;wer to the ob|jection, con&s;ider that the de&s;ign of laws is to puni&s;h evil-doers,&mdash;to bring to ju&s;tice offenders, and to &s;ecure the innocent in the peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their pro|perties: for this end GOD has ordained the&s;e higher powers; but it &s;ome times has been the ca&s;e, that tho&s;e, in who&s;e hands the&s;e powers are entru&s;ted, be|come tyrannical, and the greate&s;t offenders, and &s;hall they live with impunity? GOD forbid! how &s;hall ju&s;tice be obtained? every mode is evaded. The ca&s;e is &s;imilar with a foreign enemy, we cannot have redre&s;s any other way, no other method is left to obtain ju&s;tice; and though the mode is different, the i&s;&s;ue is the &s;ame as when we execute a criminal condemned by a jury. Suppo&s;e, a villain was to rob you of a va|luable &s;um of money, and thereby expo&s;e you and your family to di&s;tre&s;s and poverty, would you not think it your duty to pro&s;ecute &s;uch a public offender? yes, without doubt, or el&s;e you could not be a friend to the innocent part of mankind. But &s;uppo&s;e, he not only robs you, but in a daring manner, in your pre|&s;ence, murders your only &s;on, will you not think that blood calls aloud for puni&s;hment? Surely both rea&s;on and revelation will ju&s;tify you in &s;eeking for ju&s;tice in
<PB N="18" REF="014133_0017_0F9330FD0A41B798">
that mode by which it can be obtained. The pre&s;ent ca&s;e is only too &s;imilar:&mdash;by an arbitrary act all the families that depended on the Newfoundland fi&s;hery are abandoned to di&s;tre&s;s and poverty, and the blood of numbers &s;pilt already without a cau&s;e. Surely it is con&s;i&s;tent with the pure&s;t religion to &s;eek for ju&s;tice. Con&s;ider the ca&s;e in this point of view, and he that is not clear in con&s;cience to gird on his &s;word, if he would act con&s;i&s;tently, mu&s;t never &s;it on a jury to condemn a criminal.</P>
<P>II. This brings me to the &s;econd thing propo&s;ed, which was to pre&s;ent a few particulars to your con|&s;ideration, which will demon&s;trate the alarming call, which we now have, to take up arms, and fight in our own defence.&mdash;</P>
<P>We have no choice left to us, but to &s;ubmit to ab&s;o|lute &s;lavery and de&s;poti&s;m, or as free-men to &s;tand in our own defence, and endeavour a noble re&s;i&s;tance. Matters are at la&s;t brought to this deplorable ex|tremity;&mdash;every rea&s;onable method of reconciliation has been tried in vain;&mdash;our addre&s;&s;es to our king have been treated with neglect or contempt. It is true that a plan of accommodation has been propo&s;ed by admini&s;tration; but they are men of more &s;en&s;e than to think it could be accepted. It could be propo&s;ed for no other purpo&s;e than to deceive England into an opinion, that we did not de&s;ire reconciliation. What was the &s;ub&s;tance of this pretended plan? In &s;hort
<PB N="19" REF="014133_0018_0F9330FDA2632190">
this, that we &s;hould give them as much money as they were plea&s;ed to a&s;k, and we might rai&s;e it in our own mode.&mdash;Slaves therefore we mu&s;t be, only we &s;hall be indulged to put on our fetters, to &s;uit our&s;elves.&mdash;This plan is no better than that clau&s;e, which &s;ays, <Q>That the parliament have a right to make laws to bind us in all ca&s;es what&s;oever.</Q> For if they may fix the &s;um, and we mu&s;t rai&s;e it, the ca&s;e is the &s;ame, we have nothing left, but what they have no u&s;e for;&mdash;all is at their di&s;po&s;al, and we &s;hall have no voice in the application of our own money. They may apply it to rai&s;e forces in Canada, to cut our throats. The call therefore is alarming&mdash;we cannot &s;ubmit to be &s;laves&mdash;we were born free, and we can die free. Only attend to the voice of parliament, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <Q>That they have a right to make laws to bind us in all ca&s;es what&s;oever.</Q>&mdash;Even our religion is not excepted&mdash;they a&s;&s;ume a right to bind us in all ca&s;es.&mdash;Agree|able to this propo&s;ition, they may oblige us to &s;upport popi&s;h prie&s;ts, on pain of death:&mdash;they have already given us a &s;pecimen of the good effects of their a&s;&s;umed power, in e&s;tabli&s;hing popery in near one half of North-America. Is not this the loude&s;t call to arms? All is at &s;take&mdash;we can appeal to GOD, that we believe our cau&s;e is ju&s;t and good. But to attend to our text, "and fight "for your brethren," our brethren in the Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts are already declared <HI>rebels;</HI>&mdash;they are treated as &s;uch, and we as abettors are involved in the &s;ame cir|cum&s;tances;&mdash;nothing can be more unju&s;t than &s;uch a proclamation. Rebels are men di&s;affected with their

&s;overeign in favour of &s;ome other per&s;on. This is not the ca&s;e of America; for if Jacobites were not more common in England than with us, we &s;hould not have had occa&s;ion of the pre&s;ent di&s;pute. We very well know what follows this proclamation, all our e&s;tates are con|fi&s;cated, and were we even to &s;ubmit, we &s;hould be hanged as dogs.&mdash;Now therefore let us join, and fight for our brethren. Remember our Congre&s;s is in emi|nent danger. It is compo&s;ed of men of equal characters and fortunes of mo&s;t, if not &s;uperior to any in North-America.&mdash;The&s;e worthy gentlemen have ventured all in the cau&s;e of liberty for our &s;akes;&mdash;if we were to for&s;ake them, they mu&s;t be abandoned to the rage of a relentle&s;s mini&s;try. Some of them are already pro|&s;cribed, and no doubt this would be the fate of the re&s;t:&mdash;How could we bear to &s;ee the&s;e worthy patriots hanged as criminals of the deepe&s;t dye? their families plundered of all that they po&s;&s;e&s;s, and abandoned to di&s;tre&s;s and poverty? This, my countrymen, mu&s;t be the ca&s;e, if you will not now as men fight for your brethren: Therefore if we do not &s;tand by them, even unto death, we &s;hould be guilty of the ba&s;e&s;t ingrati|tude, and entail on our&s;elves everla&s;ting infamy. But if the ca&s;e of our brethren is not &s;o near as &s;uitably to affect us, let us con&s;ider the condition of our &s;ons and daughters. Your &s;ons are engaged in the pre&s;ent di&s;pute, and therefore &s;ubject to all the con&s;equences: Oh! remember if you &s;ubmit to arbitrary mea&s;ures, you will entail on your &s;ons de&s;potic power. Your &s;ons and your daughters mu&s;t be &s;trangers to the com|forts

of liberty;&mdash;they will be con&s;idered like bea&s;ts of burden, only made for their <HI>ma&s;ters u&s;e.</HI> If the groans and cries of po&s;terity in oppre&s;&s;ion can be any argument, come now, my noble countrymen, fight for your &s;ons and your daughters. But if this will not alarm you, con&s;ider what will be the ca&s;e of your wives, if a noble re&s;i&s;tance is not made: all your e&s;tates con|fi&s;cated, and di&s;tributed to the favourites of arbitrary power, your wives mu&s;t be left to di&s;tre&s;s and poverty. This might be the better endured, only the mo&s;t worthy and flower of all the land &s;hall be hanged, and widowhood and poverty both come in one day. The call to arms is therefore alarming, e&s;pecially when we con&s;ider the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel, we can expect no favour from admini&s;tration. They &s;eem to be callous, &s;o as to have no feeling of human di&s;tre&s;s. What can be a greater demon&s;tration than to excite the barbarous &s;avages again&s;t us?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is beyond di&s;pute, that Guy John&s;on is u&s;ing his influence with the Mohawks again&s;t us, as well as the Superintendant of South-Carolina.

III. It is probable that the mo&s;t will acknowledge, that the call to arms is alarming, but we are compara|tively weak to Great Britain; an an&s;wer to this will bring us to the third thing under con&s;ideration, which was, to advance a few arguments to excite fortitude in martial engagements And no argument is greater than our text, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <Q>Remember the LORD is great and terrible.</Q> All human aid is &s;ubject to di&s;ap|pointment, but when our dependance is on the al|mighty GOD, we may hope for &s;ucce&s;s, for the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to &s;hew him&s;elf &s;trong in behalf of them who&s;e heart is perfect towards him. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> xvi: 9. He gives us a glorious di&s;play of his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the ca&s;e of Abra|ham, who lifted up his hand to the mo&s;t high GOD, and pur&s;ued the four kings with their numerous ar|mies, and GOD delivered them into his hand, for he is great, and doth great and marvellous things in be|half of them that tru&s;t in him. Remember what the LORD has done in ages pa&s;t: I&s;rael were in the days of Saul &s;orely be&s;et by the Phili&s;tines,&mdash;their hearts trembled at the formidable a&s;pect of great Goliath of Gath; but GOD &s;ends forth a youth, even a &s;tripling, again&s;t this man of war, and &s;oon we &s;ee the in&s;ulting foe lie pro&s;trate at the feet of David. Call to mind what he did to the A&s;&s;yrian ho&s;t in the days of Heze|kiah: with bitter taunts Rab&s;hakeh reproaches I&s;rael, threatening, that if they did not &s;oon &s;urrender, that he would oblige them to eat their own excrements and drink their own urine.&mdash;But behold the hand of the
<PB N="23" REF="014133_0022_0F93310088B537B0">
LORD is with I&s;rael, therefore an angel of death is &s;ent, who &s;mote the A&s;&s;yrian camp, &s;o that an hundred four &s;core and five thou&s;and were dead corps in the morning light. Kings and captains may boa&s;t great things, but GOD alone is truly great, and greatly to be feared; he doth his plea&s;ure in the heavens above, and among the inhabitants of the earth, and all nations are as nothing in his &s;ight. GOD is not only great, but terrible in his judgments; an in&s;tance we have in Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who was re&s;olved to keep I&s;rael in bondage, but was fatally di&s;appointed in the red &s;ea. His judgments are both great and various; how ea&s;y is it for GOD to baffle all the coun&s;els of our enemies? how ea&s;ily can he divide them, or rai&s;e up enemies that &s;hall give them employment enough at home? So he delivered David in the wilderne&s;s of Maon. Our GOD is able to give us pity in the eyes of the nations around us, &s;o that they will afford their aid, if required. If GOD be for us, who can be again&s;t us? We have great rea&s;on to bewail the &s;ins of the land, yet the LORD has a people in it re&s;erved for him&s;elf, and if this had been the ca&s;e with Sodom, it would have been &s;aved.&mdash;Our pre&s;ent di&s;pute is ju&s;t, our cau&s;e is good.&mdash;We have been as loyal &s;ubjects as any on earth;&mdash;at all times, when occa&s;ion called, we have contributed towards the expence of war, with liberal hands, beyond our power, even in their e&s;tima|tion. When we have been called to venture our lives in defence of our king and country, have we refu&s;ed? No, verily; we have been willing to &s;pill our precious
<PB N="24" REF="014133_0023_0F933101634ED180">
blood. We have been charged with de&s;igns of inde|pendency: This po&s;&s;ibly may be the event, but &s;urely again&s;t our wills; the decent addre&s;&s;es to his Maje&s;ty, as well as all other prudential mea&s;ures, are arguments in our favour. But all our mea&s;ures are di&s;regarded, the terms offered us are but a few degrees milder than what the Ammonites offered to Jabe&s;h-Gilead. The&s;e poor men offered more than rea&s;on could a&s;k, but nothing would &s;erve, only for each to have his right eye put out&mdash;the terms were bad&mdash;tears flowed from every eye&mdash;wailings reached the ears of Saul, and the &s;pirit of the LORD came on him. 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> xi: 6. By the &s;pirit of GOD here we may under&s;tand a martial &s;pirit &s;tirred up in Saul. He a&s;&s;embles all I&s;rael, and makes a noble re&s;i&s;tance, attended with a glorious victory over the enemy.&mdash;The &s;pirit of GOD coming on him was a pre&s;age of &s;ucce&s;s. And has not the &s;ame &s;pirit come on us? A martial &s;pirit from GOD has &s;pread through|out the land. Surely, if this is not a heavy judgment, it is a pre&s;age of &s;ucce&s;s. We are fully per&s;uaded, that this &s;pirit is not a judgment, becau&s;e our cau&s;e is good, even in the &s;ight of other States. To the Mo&s;t High we can appeal, and &s;ubmit the event to his plea&s;ure. It is more than probable that we may meet with &s;ome defeats, and have much blood &s;hed; but even if this &s;hould be the ca&s;e, let us not be di&s;cou|raged; for &s;o it was with I&s;rael in their fir&s;t battles with Benjamin, but in the third battle the whole tribe of Benjamin is cut off, &s;ave &s;ix hundred men.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="014133_0024_0F93310206859DE0">
There is only one con&s;ideration that is very di&s;cou|raging, and that is the great and many &s;ins that pre|vail in our land. <Q>Unfeignedly to confe&s;s and deplore our many &s;ins,</Q> is recommended by our Congre&s;s as one duty of this day. And, alas! we have many great &s;ins abounding in our land, for which we may ju&s;tly bewail our ca&s;e before GOD, &s;ome of which, it may not be ami&s;s to mention here: but where &s;hall I begin? There is one heaven daring and God pro|voking &s;in, which prevails even among many who otherwi&s;e are gentlemen, that is profanene&s;s of language, in taking the tremendous name of GOD in vain. This is a &s;in of the fir&s;t magnitude&mdash;men have the lea&s;t ex|cu&s;e for it&mdash;no &s;en&s;e is gratified&mdash;it is attended with no profit&mdash;yet how common is it in almo&s;t every town and province! Remember that it is him, who is great and terrible, that &s;ays, he will not hold him guiltle&s;s that taketh his name in vain. Add to this, the di&s;&s;olute debauchery, drunkenne&s;s, pride and exce&s;s which pre|vails in our land, and we &s;hall not wonder that the LORD has a controver&s;y with the kingdom. The&s;e and many other &s;ins we have rea&s;on to bewail before GOD, and are the only di&s;couragements in the pre&s;ent di&s;pute. And if we are &s;ucce&s;sful in our pre&s;ent &s;truggle for liberty, we cannot expect to enjoy any la&s;ting happine&s;s without a reformation, and a life worthy of the glorious go&s;pel.&mdash;Was the fear of GOD &s;uitably in our hearts, we &s;hould be invincible; for if GOD be for us, who can be again&s;t us? But, alas! there &s;eems but little concern about for&s;aking &s;in and
<PB N="26" REF="014133_0025_0F933102CB4FEB78">
a &s;aving acquaintance with GOD, though our pre&s;ent &s;tate is &s;o alarming: All the horrors of a war is at hand&mdash;death is ready to triumph over his thou&s;ands, and are we &s;till a&s;leep in &s;in?&mdash;We are called to fight for our brethren, our &s;ons and our daughters, our wives and our hou&s;es; and if GOD for&s;akes us, our &s;lavery is &s;ure.&mdash;Many tru&s;t too much on the arm of fle&s;h; but let us place all our confidence in GOD, and u&s;e every prudential &s;tep. Nehemiah prays, but omits not the u&s;e of means, he &s;ets a watch night and day to guard again&s;t the enemy, and every man is equipped for battle.</P>
<P>Thus, my hearers, I have con&s;idered every point which demanded our pre&s;ent attention. I hope that it has been made evident, that a defen&s;ive war is &s;inle&s;s, and con&s;i&s;tent with the pure&s;t religion. This I can &s;ay, the&s;e arguments have removed all difficulties from my own brea&s;t. Seeing therefore, that it is &s;inle&s;s, and we are called to take the bloody weapons of death in hand, let not the expence of war di&s;courage us. This indeed mu&s;t be very great, but be it &s;o; we fight not for pre|&s;ent profit, no, our noble &s;truggle is for liberty it&s;elf, without which even life would be mi&s;erable&mdash;what though the half, nay the three parts, of our e&s;tates be lo&s;t, we &s;hall have the fourth remaining;&mdash;our land is good, we can live. Providence can ea&s;ily compen&s;ate our lo&s;s. And remember the LORD is great, matters may have a &s;peedy i&s;&s;ue; he can rai&s;e the &s;pirit of the inhabitants of Great-Britain in our favour;&mdash;their

voice &s;hall reach the throne;&mdash;he is able to open the eyes of admini&s;tration, or remove our enemies from about his Maje&s;ty, &s;o that there may yet be a happy reconciliation with Great-Britain. We have con&s;idered the alarming call, which we have to take up arms;&mdash;let us unite as men po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a true &s;en&s;e of liberty. If any are not clear in con&s;cience, let us not de&s;pi&s;e them I confe&s;s &s;ome are provoking, but mildne&s;s is our duty; that with well-doing we may &s;ilence the ob&s;tinacy of evil men.&mdash;On the whole, we are come to the unhappy &s;tate of a civil war, and I remember Bi|&s;hop Burnet makes a remark to this effect, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <Q>Of all calamities it is the greate&s;t, for though we know where it begins, we know not where it &s;hall end.</Q>&mdash;If ever there was one time that called for more re|ligion than another, this is the very time. And yet, alas! alas! how few are &s;eeking GOD! how few are &s;eeking their &s;alvation, when death is even at the door, and all at &s;take! Let me therefore entreat you &s;eri|ou&s;ly to lay to heart the pre&s;ent &s;tate, and <Q>remem|ber the LORD, which is great and terrible.</Q> <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
