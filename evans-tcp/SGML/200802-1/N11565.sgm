<Q><BIBL><HI>2. KINGS. XVIII.30&mdash;32.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Neither let Hezekiah make you tru&s;t in the Lord, &s;aying, the Lord will &s;urely deliver us, and this City &s;hall not be delivered into the hand of the King of A&s;&s;yria. Hearken not unto Hezekiah: For thus &s;aith the King of A&s;&s;yria, make an agreement with me by a pre&s;ent, and come out to me, and then eat ye every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig-tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his ci&s;tern: Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oyl-olive, and of honey, that ye may live and not die: And hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he per&s;uadeth you, &s;aying the Lord will deliver us.</P></Q>

<P>TWO ways, from the word of God, may we learn the mind of God and his coun|&s;el to us&mdash;either from what God enjoins or from what his people under &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances have practiced, or by what Satan and his in&s;truments would di&s;&s;uade us from or per|&s;uade us to,&mdash;and by the la&s;t, often, with the &s;ame evidence as by the fir&s;t; as Satan and his in&s;truments, according to their mea&s;ure of power and craft, are always engaged in endeavours to keep us from the right ways of the Lord, and lead
<PB N="6" REF="014615_0004_0F94336A65732C68">
us into evil; and as, in proportion to the evil, they ever proportion their de&s;ires and endeavours to lead us into it. Satan is well plea&s;ed to throw Job into outward di&s;tre&s;&s;es; but he would be more plea&s;ed if, by this means, he may conquer his virtue and induce him to bla&s;pheme his ma|ker, as far the greater evil.&mdash;In a word, as God is ever doing good and per&s;uading us to obey and follow him, as the greate&s;t good, &s;o is Satan, and &s;o, according to their mea&s;ure, are Satan's in|&s;truments, doing us evil, and, "like Lions &s;eek|ing whom they may devour," &s;tudying to keep us from God, and lead us, under various gui&s;es, to &s;in the greate&s;t evil, and to all other evil accor|ding as it is evil.</P>
<P>Thus, in the pa&s;&s;age before us, does a &s;ervant of the King of A&s;&s;yria, an eminent emblem of Lu|cifer, in obedience to his ma&s;ter, endeavour to lead the Jews to the greate&s;t evil, even to ca&s;t off their tru&s;t in God and regard to his &s;ervants, and per|&s;uade them to a &s;urrender of their <HI>earthly all</HI> to the mere will of his ma&s;ter. For this purpo&s;e he u&s;es many &s;ounding but unmeaning promi&s;es, and mixes with them the mo&s;t imperious threat|nings.</P>
<P>He tells them that he come from the great King of A&s;&s;yria&mdash;boa&s;ts of what his ma&s;ter had done&mdash;and would per&s;uade them that it would be no lo&s;s to them to &s;ubmit&mdash;and that it was in vain to tru&s;t in either God or man for help again&s;t &s;uch a power. Hezekiah, a &s;ervant of God, and they that were with him, would per&s;uade the Jews not to &s;ubmit that tho' their enemies were in|deed &s;trong, yet the Lord was mightier&mdash;and that agreeable to his wanted righteou&s;ne&s;s and mercy, they might in a humble obedient regard to him,
<PB N="7" REF="014615_0005_0F94336AF8606F20">
yet hope in the Lord. Satan therefore puts Rab|&s;hakeh on urging the little di&s;advantage and ab|&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and di&s;uading them from a tru&s;t in God, which he mo&s;t dreaded, as knowing that their &s;afety mu&s;t chiefly depend on this.</P>
<P>Let us con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">I. The nature and importance of a true tru&s;t in God&mdash;from which Rab&s;hakeh would di&s;&s;uade the Jews.</P>
<P N="2">II. The nature of the propo&s;als which Rab&s;ha|keh makes to the Jews.</P>
<P N="3">III. The motives, addre&s;&s;ed to their hopes and fears, by which he enforces the&s;e propo&s;als.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The applicablene&s;s of this&mdash;to the tempta|tions of Satan in general, or to the &s;ituation of this land in particular.</P>
<P N="1">I. Let us attempt &s;ome view of the nature and importance of a true tru&s;t in God &mdash;from which Rab&s;hakeh would di&s;&s;uade the Jews.</P>
<P>"Tru&s;t in the Lord with all thy heart," &s;aith true wi&s;dom&mdash;tru&s;t in the Lord at all times &s;aith a &s;ervant of God; 'tru&s;t not in the Lord," &s;aith an in&s;trument of Satan. Both expre&s;s its impor|tance. God knows its entire &s;uitablene&s;s, and therefore commends it. His &s;ervants know its worth, and therefore heartily recommend it. Sa|tan is well appri&s;ed of the danger from it to his intere&s;t, and therefore does his utmo&s;t to prevent it. Its importance is &s;ealed by the pains God takes to promote and &s;ecure this tru&s;t, in the di&s;|play of divine power, wi&s;dom, &s;ufficiency and faith|fulne&s;s, in the works, word, and providence of God;&mdash;and by all the wiles of Satan, from his grand &s;ucce&s;s with our fir&s;t parents, through all the temptations he u&s;es with the children of men&mdash;
<PB N="8" REF="014615_0006_0F9433706FB63FA8">
In all of which, the &s;ucce&s;s of his mo&s;t dangerous attempts on mankind have ever depended on his keeping out of view, or leading the &s;oul to di&s;|tru&s;t the divine power, wi&s;dom, holine&s;s, or &s;uffi|ciency.</P>
<P>If in addition to this, we remember the ble&s;&s;ed advantages of <HI>tru&s;ting in God</HI>&mdash;that "they that tru&s;t in the Lord &s;hall be as mount Zion", and on the other hand, the awful doom of the fearful and unbelieving; it may well induce, even the carele&s;s mind to enquire &s;omething about its na|ture, and di&s;po&s;e all to look to the foundation of their confidence.</P>
<P>Let us employ a few thoughts on the general nature of tru&s;t&mdash;the di&s;tingui&s;hing nature of tru&s;t in God&mdash;and the principle exerci&s;es of this tru&s;t.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let us think a little of the general nature of tru&s;t. &mdash;'Tis then a quieting regard to the ability, love, wi&s;dom, or faithfulne&s;s of any be|ing; exerci&s;ing which, the &s;oul &s;o far re&s;ts, as a building on its foundation. Or it is the expecta|tion of &s;ome particular, general, or &s;upreme good from the object on which the &s;oul leans, as &s;uita|ble to afford the expected &s;upport. 'Tis then a rea&s;onable and right confidence when only that is expected which the object, on which the &s;oul, either partially or fully leans, is fitted to afford, by power, &s;ituation, or will, that which is expec|ted. Thus, in animate things, we tru&s;t in a &s;taff to &s;upport us. We tru&s;t in whole&s;ome food to nouri&s;h us&mdash;we expect &s;helter from the rain in a &s;ufficient hou&s;e&mdash;a good crop from a fertile &s;oil, and warmth, u&s;ually, from clothes.</P>
<P>So in things animate, we expect, u&s;ually, la|bour from the ox; &s;wiftne&s;s from the hor&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="014615_0007_0F943372C23F3200">So in rational beings&mdash;we tru&s;t in the wi&s;e for direction&mdash;the faithful that they will &s;peak the truth &mdash;the holy and righteous that they will &s;et us a good example.&mdash; And in a degree, we always tru&s;t in the good, the faithful, the rich, the wi&s;e, for help, &s;upport, comfort, or needful coun&s;el.</P>
<P>Tru&s;t is thus allied to expectation; but ever di&s;tingui&s;hed from it, in that we expect evil as well as good, but we never tru&s;t in any object for apprehended evil. Tru&s;t is al&s;o nearly related to hope; but&mdash;ever di&s;tingui&s;hed from it, as &s;eeing and travelling towards a firm rock are di&s;tingui|&s;hed from leaning or &s;tanding, and depending upon the &s;tability of that rock.</P>
<P>Hope is de&s;iring and expecting &s;ome good viewed as at a di&s;tance. Tru&s;t is delighting in, and leaning upon, and expecting the continuance of &s;ome good viewed as pre&s;ent. Expectation &s;hall be &s;wallowed up;&mdash;hope exchanged; but tru&s;t in the &s;upreme good &s;hall ever remain with the holy.</P>
<P>Tru&s;t may differ in degree, and in its objects; but it has &s;till the &s;ame general nature, even when there is much uncertainty; as in our regard to the te&s;timony of a per&s;on of a doubtful character, &s;o long as there is any expectation of that for which we tru&s;t in the object.&mdash;Then only does it quite vani&s;h, when all the apprehended grounds of tru&s;t vani&s;h&mdash;when the &s;taff breaks&mdash;the rock &s;inks&mdash;the hou&s;e is broken up&mdash;the harve&s;t is quite bla&s;ted;&mdash;or, in general, when that comes which quite removes the ground of our tru&s;t; a ca&s;e which the di&s;ciples were ready to think had happened, when after the death of Chri&s;t they &s;ay, "we tru&s;ted that it was he that &s;hould have delivered I&s;rael."</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="014615_0008_0F94337442EA27A0">Thus far the tru&s;t in general.&mdash;With regard to the di&s;tingui&s;hing nature of tru&s;t in God, we ob&s;erve&mdash;'Tis an entire per&s;ua&s;ion of the &s;uffici|ency of his power, wi&s;dom, holine&s;s, and goodne&s;s, which quiets, animates, and regulates the &s;oul, and warms it into a &s;erene calm, and healthy ex|erci&s;e of all its powers for God;&mdash;or it is a re|gard to this glorious object according to its glo|rious nature.</P>
<P>Of con&s;equence there is a two fold foundation of a right holy tru&s;t in God&mdash;the unchangeable glories of God&mdash;and a right reli&s;h in our hearts.</P>
<P>The foundation in God is what God is and has done. Here, a&s;&s;uredly, there is the mo&s;t perfect foundation of tru&s;t.</P>
<P>Do we expect that a rock will &s;upport us. "The Lord is a rock". His power formed and upholds the known and unknown worlds. Un&s;haken and &s;ecure in him&s;elf, though the weight of worlds lies on him, yet he &s;upports them all with infinite ea&s;e, as the ma&s;&s;y rock the little du&s;t.</P>
<P>Do we place confidence in the coun&s;els and di|rections of the wi&s;e? Behold,&mdash;"the only wi&s;e God", compared with whom the knowledge and wi&s;dom of men and angels is but folly. Does he coun&s;el and direct us? He cannot be mi&s;taken. Shall we not tru&s;t to his coun&s;els and rely on his directions? Shall our hearts venture a &s;ingle movement, as doubtful whether it is infinitely &s;afe&s;t and be&s;t for us to depend, and ab&s;olutely rely on his determination of our end, bu&s;ine&s;s, path, or happine&s;s?</P>
<P>Do we tru&s;t that fellow creatures of approved fidelity will not deceive us? Shall we not, with|out wavering, tru&s;t that holy "God who can|not lie"?</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="014615_0009_0F943374D1E8D2D8">Do we often tru&s;t much to, and build much upon the goodne&s;s of a fellow creature? Shall we not tru&s;t the goodne&s;s of the Father of the Univer&s;e; that he will do towards us all, that which is, on the whole be&s;t? Do we expect much from a &s;park of goodne&s;s? Shall we not tru&s;t in goodne&s;s it&s;elf?</P>
<P>Do we tru&s;t much to the &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s of &s;ome among our fellow creatures? Shall we not in|tirely depend upon it that the unchangeable God will conduct like him&s;elf?</P>
<P>But now of the&s;e, and all his infinite glories God has given, and we may find complete evi|dence. His power crouds on our view in all we &s;ee and know, &s;mall and great. "The heavens proclaim his glory", as their almighty builder. And earth has as many voices as inhabitants, or even as &s;pires of gra&s;s, or particles of du&s;t; to &s;hout forth to every attentive ear "Lord God Almighty". His wi&s;dom &s;hines in all the harmo|ny of creation.</P>
<P>His goodne&s;s mildly, but brightly beams forth in all the avenues for the objects of our &s;en&s;es&mdash; in all the plea&s;ing engagements and di&s;coveries of rea&s;on and imagination&mdash;in all the evil prevented and good be&s;towed.</P>
<P>His Holine&s;s &s;hines in his law&mdash;is di&s;covered by the awaken'd, and reli&s;h'd by the &s;anctified con|&s;cience.</P>
<P>His unchangeablene&s;s is the re&s;ult of his other glories&mdash;and is &s;trongly mark'd in the ordinances of heaven, and atte&s;ted by the &s;teady laws of nature.</P>
<P>His grace and promi&s;es are rich and large &mdash;in harmony with him&s;elf, and adopted to remove tho&s;e dreadful bars that &s;in and guilt had thrown in the way.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="014615_0010_0F9433757A75A708">Thus is there a foundation in God, large and firm enough to &s;ecure the tru&s;t of all tho&s;e who&s;e hearts are prepared to &s;ee and acknowledge God.</P>
<P>But tho' there is infinite rea&s;on, in what God is and does, for entire tru&s;t in him; yet, plainly, many "tru&s;t not in the living God". Many for|get God, or, "thro' pride of countenance will not &s;eek him". Many have no conformity to his image, concern about his favour, or regard to his Son; or feel &s;en&s;ible oppo&s;ition and aver|&s;ion, directly oppo&s;ite to tru&s;t. There mu&s;t then be a belief of the divine Being and Perfections.</P>
<P>We may be &s;upported by we know not what: But we cannot tru&s;t in that of which we have no knowledge. We often mi&s;take indeed, and in our tru&s;t in creatures generally, or univer&s;al|ly, rather; yet even here we tru&s;t in them as be|ing &s;ufficient; and can no otherwi&s;e tru&s;t in any thing, than as thus apprehended by us.</P>
<P>Further,</P>
<P>There mu&s;t be al&s;o a &s;atisfaction in the&s;e per|fections.</P>
<P>However grand and augu&s;t our views of God's glories are; yet we &s;hall tru&s;t in them no other|wi&s;e than as we delight in them, or are plea&s;ed with them, either in them&s;elves, or in &s;ome relation to us. But if, as is often the ca&s;e, we tru&s;t in, or expect the continued exerci&s;e of the divine power and wi&s;dom in confined re&s;pects, or for foreign rea&s;ons, as&mdash;upholding and directing the &s;un, rain, and all tho&s;e things which are agreable to us: yet this is rather a &s;econdary tru&s;t; &s;ince, with our regard to the&s;e inferior objects, our tru&s;t cea&s;es;&mdash;as we cea&s;e to regard a particular in&s;tru|ment when its u&s;e is gone. Such a &s;econdary tru&s;t in God we may have, and often have, while
<PB N="13" REF="014615_0011_0F943376411FDB68">
a large view of the divine power and wi&s;dom in upholding and governing, directing and enforce|ing, are painful to us. We tru&s;t no further than we are plea&s;ed with the&s;e glories. Even he that vainly thinks that the&s;e perfections &s;hall be to his eternal benefit; yet he tru&s;ts not in them, &s;o long as he does not reli&s;h the direction of the divine wi&s;dom, and dictates of the divine authority in the law of God. This has to his view no perfect wi&s;dom; and therefore he ever contrives &s;ome way to ca&s;t it a&s;ide. In order to this tru&s;t, an ho|ly reli&s;h of &s;oul is nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>As this reli&s;h is not univer&s;al or natural to mankind, it is nece&s;&s;ary, in order to tru&s;t in God, that we be "born again"&mdash;renewed in the tem|per of our hearts, or have a "new heart". We mu&s;t be broken off from our vain confidence in the creature and our&s;elves&mdash;our own &s;trength, wi&s;|dom, and righteou&s;ne&s;s. For as God <HI>looketh to the humble</HI>; &s;o only the humble can look to God in the exerci&s;e of a holy tru&s;t. So far as the heart fails of ju&s;t views and &s;en&s;e of its own little|ne&s;s and loth&s;omene&s;s, or of an holy reli&s;h for the divine glories; &s;o far mu&s;t it fail of a right tru&s;t.</P>
<P>As to the principal exerci&s;es and effects of this tru&s;t, we can hint but briefly.</P>
<P>In general,&mdash;we &s;ay</P>
<P>A true tru&s;t in God quiets the &s;oul. "He that tru&s;ts in the Lord &s;hall be as Mount Zion". So again, &s;ays the P&s;almi&s;t, "He &s;hall not be afraid of evil tidings; his heart is fixed tru&s;ting in the Lord". Though winds of fears and troubles blow, yet he is fixed by an holy tru&s;t on the rock of ages. "I am", &s;ays the P&s;almi&s;t, "like a green olive tree; for I tru&s;t in thy word". As &s;ome trees are green in winter, &s;o this tru&s;t will cau&s;e
<PB N="14" REF="014615_0012_0F94337712279928">
the &s;oul to flouri&s;h even in the cold bla&s;ts of out|ward di&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;It prevents murmurings as its direct oppo&s;ite.&mdash;It keeps us from crooked paths, as oppo&s;ed to the wi&s;e and holy directions of God; in which we tru&s;t as be&s;t.</P>
<P>This tru&s;t is <HI>exerci&s;ed,</HI> principally and univer|&s;ally, in committing the &s;oul and all its concerns to God for time and eternity&mdash;leaning on him as able and &s;ufficient to uphold us.</P>
<P>This is actively expre&s;&s;ed in various ways. 'Tis exerci&s;ed in <HI>prayer.</HI> As &s;aith the P&s;almi&s;t, "tru&s;t in the Lord at all times, pour out your hearts before him". It is directly expre&s;&s;ed in prai&s;e; in which the &s;oul looks over, delights in, and re&s;ts upon the fulne&s;s of God. It is exerci|&s;ed in remembering pa&s;t &s;upport, and in &s;eeking future favours. It has much place in reading and &s;tudying the works and word of God&mdash;that we may know more of the glory, and learn the mind and will of God.</P>
<P><HI>Again.</HI> As we are &s;inners, this tru&s;t is exerci|&s;ed in go&s;pel repentance and faith&mdash;in hating &s;in, lothing our&s;elves, and lying low before God; in all of which, &s;o far as evangelical, the &s;oul tru&s;ts in God, as being, directing, and doing all that which is right. In faith 'tis directly exerci&s;ed in tru&s;ting to a crucified ri&s;en Saviour, as the image of the Father, the gift of his love, in whom are di&s;|played, and by whom are e&s;tabli&s;hed all the decla|rations of the divine authority, wi&s;dom, holine&s;s, and love, in the works and law of God. Thus does this tru&s;t imply, and furni&s;h the &s;oul for the exerci&s;e of true love to God and his creatures.</P>
<P>Of con&s;equence <HI>La&s;tly</HI>&mdash;this tru&s;t flows forth in obedience to the commands of God. Why are any di&s;obedient; when there is &s;uch infinite
<PB N="15" REF="014615_0013_0F943377B882DF88">
rea&s;on for obedience to God? God declares the univer&s;al cau&s;e in the ca&s;e of I&s;rael&mdash;"She obey|ed not my voice; <HI>She tru&s;ted not in the Lord</HI>". Do we tru&s;t in God? We ju&s;t &s;o far believe and feel the reality of his being, and the perfection and de&s;irablene&s;s of his authority. Do we tru&s;t that God's directions are &s;afe and be&s;t? We are, ju&s;t &s;o far, impelled to walk in the paths, and u&s;e the methods and means&mdash;his authority and wi&s;|dom point out.</P>
<P>This is, I think, &s;ome &s;ketch of a true tru&s;t in God:&mdash;that tru&s;t, from which Rab&s;hakeh would di&s;&s;uade the Jews.&mdash;And well he might. For &s;o far as they tru&s;ted in God, they built on that which infinitely &s;unk his ma&s;ter. Did they tru&s;t in the divine power, as &s;ufficient? Where are his proud que&s;tions, "Who is your God, that he &s;hould deliver you out of the hand of my ma&s;ter"? Did they tru&s;t in the divine wi&s;dom? Where are his and his ma&s;ter's crafty de&s;igns? Did they tru&s;t in the divine righteou&s;ne&s;s and mercy, to vindicate their cau&s;e again&s;t an unju&s;t and cruel invader? It &s;inks his ma&s;ter and him|&s;elf into mon&s;ters, mere bea&s;ts of prey. Well might he then de&s;ire to prevent this tru&s;t, which effectually barr'd all his propo&s;als to them.</P>
<P>Let us briefly view</P>
<P N="2">2. The nature of the propo&s;als which Rab|&s;hakeh makes to the Jews.</P>
<P>As he eagerly di&s;&s;uades them from tru&s;ting God; &s;o he warmly pre&s;&s;es them to tru&s;t him and his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>He propo&s;es then to the Jews to "make an a|greement with him by a pre&s;ent". This is an ea&s;y way of ending a great difficulty&mdash;if the <HI>pre|&s;ent</HI> be not too large. What &s;ort of a <HI>pre&s;ent</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="014615_0014_0F943379E04830D0">
mu&s;t this needs be that would &s;atisfy <HI>him</HI>? A&s;&s;ur|edly, nothing &s;hort of an entire &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. No|thing &s;hort of <HI>pre&s;enting</HI> their e&s;tates to his will&mdash; to be u&s;ed as he thought proper;&mdash;their bodies to his &s;ervice, and their religion to this regulati|on&mdash;&s;o far, at lea&s;t, as to acknowledge that there was no God like the King of A&s;&s;yria. A pre&s;ent indeed this! He is willing to compliment them &s;o far, if they will make this entire &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, as to call it a pre&s;ent.&mdash;But have we not mi&s;ta|ken him? would he be contented with no pre&s;ent &s;hort of this? plainly, he would not. 'Tis ever included in entire unre&s;erved &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion &mdash;tho' called by the &s;oft name of a pre&s;ent. And, as very deci&s;ive evidence, we are ju&s;t before informed that Hezekiah had <HI>given</HI> his ma&s;ter "all the &s;il|ver found in the hou&s;e of the Lord, and in the trea&s;ures of the Kings hou&s;e". But this was not enough. Still the call is for a <HI>pre&s;ent</HI>&mdash;as long as there is any thing left to <HI>pre&s;ent.</HI> For no <HI>pre&s;ent</HI>&mdash; they could &s;end would an&s;wer: But they mu&s;t "come out", and pre&s;ent it, and them&s;elves a|long with it; or el&s;e it would never &s;atisfy this hor&s;e-leech, crying, "give, give".</P>
<P>Let us take notice,</P>
<P N="3">3. Of the motives, addre&s;&s;ed to their hopes and fears, by which he enforces the&s;e propo&s;als.</P>
<P>There needed a&s;&s;uredly, &s;ome very important rea&s;ons to enforce &s;uch propo&s;als as the&s;e. Rab|&s;hakeh has the rea&s;ons ready to a&s;&s;ign.</P>
<P>He tells them that if they will make an unre|&s;erved &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion&mdash;pre&s;enting them&s;elves and their all to him,&mdash;he will engage, and &s;urely they may believe him, after he has prevailed on them to di&s;tru&s;t God,&mdash;that he will pre&s;ent back a|gain to them enough of their own for them to

live comfortably upon, and en&s;ure to them the quiet enjoyment of it. They &s;hall "eat", at lea&s;t as long as his ma&s;ter in his wi&s;dom thought be&s;t, "every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink every one the water of his ci&s;tern": Which they were &s;en&s;ible, was the very manner in which their God u&s;ed to &s;peak of ble&s;&s;ing them.&mdash;They &s;hould plant and &s;ew, and have enough for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tance at harve&s;t, and his word for their &s;ecurity from their enemies on all &s;ides. They &s;hould enjoy all this in as great a degree, and as long, as the great King of A&s;&s;yria thought be&s;t. And, &s;urely, this mu&s;t be &s;afer for them, than to be left to their own judg|ment in di&s;po&s;ing of, and their own &s;trength in defending them&s;elves and &s;ub&s;tance. He engag|es that they &s;hall be dre&s;&s;ers of their own fields and vineyards&mdash;for a &s;ea&s;on; and that if the great King of A&s;&s;yria thought be&s;t in his wi&s;dom, after a time, to remove them to &s;ome other parts of his dominions, yet, he engages that they &s;hould be carried to a land as good as their own, and of the &s;ame kind; where they &s;hould enjoy all need|ful food, drink and cloathing in the cultivation of the country: And as this was all they could rea|&s;onably de&s;ire, their ca&s;e mu&s;t needs be far better to enjoy the&s;e under the &s;ecurity of &s;uch a wi&s;e, great, and good King as his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Thus far, he addre&s;&s;es their hopes. But, now, to fa&s;ten, and give force to, the rea&s;ons for the propo&s;ed &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion,&mdash; he attacks their fears,&mdash; and tells them that, if they will not &s;ubmit, die they mu&s;t, and die they &s;hall&mdash;that there was no way for them to pre&s;erve their lives&mdash;no way that they might "live and not die", but accept|ing his offers,&mdash;for neither God or man would
<PB N="18" REF="014615_0016_0F94337ACCC126E8">
or could defend them.&mdash;He makes the propo&s;als in mere compa&s;&s;ion to them, before he &s;trikes the fatal blow;&mdash;which in the name, and armed with the &s;trength of his ma&s;ter, he &s;hall immedi|ately deal out to them, unle&s;s they immediately comply with his ju&s;t and merciful propo&s;als.&mdash; And now what will they do, "that he may give an&s;wer to him that &s;ent him"? Will they &s;ubmit and live, and live comfortably, or die mi&s;erably?</P>
<P>Let us view a little,</P>
<P N="4">4. The applicablene&s;s of this to the temptations of Satan, in general,&mdash;or the &s;ituation of this land in particular.</P>
<P>As to the applicablene&s;s of this to the tempta|tions of Satan, in general,&mdash;</P>
<P>This is what Satan has always attempted, and that in which he has had dreadful &s;ucce&s;s, to pre|vent tru&s;t in God.</P>
<P>Thus did he attack, and thus, to the ruin of them&s;elves and the whole family of mankind, did he &s;ucceed with our fir&s;t parents.&mdash;From the na|ture and &s;trictne&s;s of the command, arguing a|gain&s;t the reality of it&mdash;"yea hath God &s;aid ye &s;hall not eat of every tree of the garden":&mdash;And from the &s;everity of the threatning, and the &s;en|&s;ible, or imagined advantages of di&s;obedience, pre&s;&s;ing the conclu&s;ion, that the threatning was only a &s;carecrow;&mdash;"ye &s;hall not &s;urely die; for God doth know that in the day ye eat, your eyes &s;hall be opened". In both, urging a di&s;tru&s;t of the truth, faithfulne&s;s, wi&s;dom, and goodne&s;s of God.&mdash;As if, though God would not be much di&s;plea&s;ed with their di&s;obedience, yet he begrutch'd them the advantage they would gain by it. Thus has Satan conducted ever &s;ince. So long as he can keep out of view the power, pre&s;ence,
<PB N="19" REF="014615_0017_0F94337B73B5E658">
authority, wi&s;dom, goodne&s;s, and holine&s;s of God, or darken the &s;oul's view and &s;en&s;e of them, &s;o that they &s;hall have on the mind only the force of doubtful conclu&s;ions; &s;o long has he ea&s;y acce&s;s to the &s;oul&mdash;to unhinge it from all de&s;ires, and endeavours to obey God, and, on the contrary, lead it by hopes and fears addre&s;&s;ed to all the common &s;prings of the &s;oul, to trample on the divine commands, and give the &s;inful heart flow|ing reins. A &s;oul, uninfluenced by tru&s;t in God, Satan ea&s;ily per&s;uades that in the ways of &s;in it &s;hall find earthly ea&s;e and plea&s;ure, the only things of importance when, and &s;o far as the &s;oul di&s;|tru&s;ts God,&mdash;that in this way it may enjoy riches and honour, gratify the &s;en&s;es, and "fulfil the de|&s;ires of the fle&s;h and of the mind", and all with|out any di&s;turbance or fear: or, that if any &s;et of plea&s;ures fail, others &s;hall come to &s;upply their places&mdash;that if the imagin'd plea&s;ures of godline&s;s fail, the plea&s;ures of &s;in &s;hall abound&mdash;far more to our reli&s;h&mdash;that if we are taken away, we &s;hall, at lea&s;t, enjoy ea&s;e, and may expect &s;uch good as &s;uits us, if we &s;urvive death, &s;o as to be capable of pain or plea&s;ure. On the other hand, Satan per&s;uades the &s;oul, void of tru&s;t in God, that if it will not hearken to the coun&s;el of lu&s;ts, there is pre&s;ent death to all comforts, in plea&s;ing our&s;elves, gratifying our lu&s;ts, and enjoying the good our heart reli&s;hes&mdash;and that it were as well to die, as to be deprived of the plea&s;ures of &s;in, and come under the re&s;traints, and walk in the glooms of religion.</P>
<P>In this, Satan ever &s;ucceeds, ju&s;t &s;o far as he can introduce di&s;tru&s;t of the truth, holine&s;s, or in ge|neral of the perfections of God.</P>
<P>So long as the &s;oul firmly a&s;&s;ents to the truth of God, and confides in his wi&s;dom, and re&s;ts in

his &s;ufficiency, Satan finds no opening to intro|duce his temptations&mdash;here he mu&s;t and does be|gin, and here, alas, he has melancholly &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>As to the applicablene&s;s of this to the &s;ituation of this land in particular&mdash;We ob&s;erve</P>
<P N="1">1. Here is a mighty claim of Rab&s;hakeh, in the name of the king of A&s;&s;yria, that they, the Jews, &s;hould agree with him, &s;ubmit, and pre&s;ent their earthly all to him and his &s;ervice. Whence is then his right to this? It &s;hould &s;eem that one of the&s;e three involve the be&s;t title that we can make out for him&mdash;</P>
<P>Either&mdash;that their father Abraham, from whom the Jews profe&s;&s;ed to de&s;cend, came from the land of Chaldea, and &s;o was a &s;ubject of that empire; and of con&s;equence they al&s;o, as de&s;cendants from him&mdash;or that not long before, under the reign of Ahaz, the A&s;&s;yrian King had &s;ubdued the City of Dama&s;cus and kingdom of Syria, a neigh|bouring power, which had long been a &s;courge to the Jews&mdash;or, if this evidence were not complete, that the King of A&s;&s;yria had &s;ome hundred thou|&s;and men, ready to prove, at the point of the &s;word, the argument full and unan&s;werable.</P>
<P>Thus the Parliament of Britain claim a right to us and ours in America&mdash;to do with us and ours as they &s;hall think be&s;t,&mdash;with re&s;pect to life and property&mdash;all that which can come under the juri&s;diction of any earthly power. They de&s;ire that we would agree with them in this,&mdash;and make them a pre&s;ent of our&s;elves and our earthly all, to be di&s;po&s;ed of as they &s;hall judge proper. They de&s;ire that we &s;hould yield their right to this: Or, in their own language, they claim, and in&s;i&s;t on our yielding it to them that, "of right, they have power to bind the people of the&s;e colo|nies

by &s;tatutes <HI>in all ca&s;es what&s;oever</HI>": And ac|cordingly they are now attempting to enforce this claim.</P>
<P>Whence, now, ari&s;es this right?</P>
<P>'Tis urged, that our fathers came from Britain, a century or two ago, and that, being &s;ubjects of Britain, before they came here, they, and their po&s;terity, to all generations, mu&s;t and ought to remain &s;o.&mdash;Though it is ob&s;ervable that if there is any force in this, 'tis either in a great mea&s;ure lo&s;t by our fathers coming directly from another country, Holland, where they had long lived as &s;ubjects&mdash;or el&s;e the argument will recoil on them&s;elves, and oblige them to this entire &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to the inhabitants of A&s;ia, from whence, a&s;&s;uredly, their fathers came. But in&s;tead of this, they attempt to en&s;lave them as well as us.</P>
<P>In addition to this, 'tis urged that Britain has defended and &s;ecured the Colonies&mdash;and lately conquered Canada, a neighbouring power, which had long been a &s;courge to us. For this &s;ervice, without con&s;ulting us, they judge them&s;elves en|titled to the di&s;po&s;al of us, and our property. Although it might &s;eem but fair, fir&s;t to have &s;tated <HI>their</HI> accounts, and de&s;ired <HI>ours,</HI> and pro|po&s;ed a fair reckoning, and then demanded the balance, if any due. In&s;tead of which, they make the charge, prove their own accounts, and proceed to an attachment of us and our proper|ty, without allowing any appeal from their deci|&s;ion&mdash;although we, as well as the Jews, and all mankind, &s;hould be unwilling for a pretended creditor to be both judge and executioner; and although much of their charge again&s;t us appear to us, and many among them&s;elves, either groundle&s;s or much too high; and although
<PB N="22" REF="014615_0020_0F943383E9FF7318">
no credit be allowed us in balance of that part of their account which is rea&s;onable.&mdash;If we a&s;k, did A&s;&s;yria conquer Canaan for I&s;rael? The an&s;wer is no. A&s;k again; did Britain purcha&s;e or conquer America for our Fathers? The plain an&s;wer is no, they did not. The &s;ame God that conducted I&s;rael into the land of Canaan, con|ducted, and in his providence, made way for our Fathers.&mdash;Enquire further, did Britain defend the&s;e Colonies in their infancy? The an&s;wer mu&s;t &s;till be no. But we are told, perhaps Britain would have defended us, if we had been attack|ed. We hear of no attempts to defend us in the only capital in&s;tance of de&s;igns again&s;t us. We are then informed the&s;e de&s;igns would have been multiplied and &s;urely &s;ucceeded, had not fear of the power of Britain prevented. 'Tis hard to prove or di&s;approve this article of charge again&s;t us&mdash;If allow'd&mdash;and Britains claim in con&s;equence; we are indebted&mdash;as a flock of &s;heep to wolves, that have &s;ecured them by their how|lings, tho' without de&s;ign, from foxes and &s;mall dogs, and then devour them for their pay&mdash; as, &s;ure, no powers that would have attack'd us, would have aim'd at more than to do with us and ours as they &s;hould think be&s;t. But however this be&mdash; we are de&s;ired to remember that, lately, Britain has conquered Canada. Tho' here, the argu|ment of the A&s;&s;yrian king &s;eems to have the ad|vantage; as he conquered Dama&s;cus on &s;ome particular de&s;ires and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions of Ahaz, and without any aid from him: whereas Britain con|quered&mdash;with the fully proportion'd help of Ame|rica, this Province in particular. Both agree in this&mdash;that both A&s;&s;yria and Britain have retain'd the &s;overeignty and property to them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="014615_0021_0F943384804ACC70">But, now, if from the&s;e two arguments, there is not a full conviction on our minds of our obligation to yield the point of right; Britain, as well as A&s;&s;yria has another argument at hand, which &s;he &s;uppo&s;es mu&s;t produce conviction. She has and &s;ends her fleets and armies, to prove every part of the argument, which might &s;eem otherwi&s;e to fail.</P>
<P>This leads us to ob&s;erve</P>
<P N="2">2. The corre&s;pondence in the motives, urged by each to inforce their claims.</P>
<P>The offers made by Rab&s;hakeh are that, if the Jews will agree with him, and &s;ubmit to him, and make him a pre&s;ent of their <HI>earthly all,</HI> them&s;elves and &s;ub&s;tance&mdash;they &s;hall for a &s;ea&s;on, at lea&s;t, have a &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, with his &s;ecurity, by their labour on their own.</P>
<P>Thus does Britain promi&s;e that, if we will part with the right, and peaceably &s;ubmit&mdash;we &s;hall, under &s;uch limits as they think fit, labour on our own, and enjoy as much of the fruit and benefit of our labour, as they &s;hall &s;ee and judge be&s;t for us.&mdash;If we will &s;ubmit as dutiful &s;er|vants, they mean not to &s;tarve us, but to allow us as much food and cloathing as they judge we need: And, &s;ure, they can judge as well or bet|ter than we. As to what we can earn, over and above this, as to be &s;ure, we can make no good u&s;e of it, we may depend upon it, that they will u&s;e it wi&s;ely, but we need not enquire how.&mdash; Rab&s;hakeh engages&mdash;till he &s;ees &s;it, to come and remove them to &s;ome other part of the em|pire&mdash;as ma&s;ters, we know, may wi&s;ely employ their &s;ervants, now in one, now in another part of their e&s;tates, as they judge proper.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="014615_0022_0F9433854ACA6BB0">Thus Britain begins to tell&mdash;of removing us from county to county, from province to pro|vince, or from America to Britain, as &s;he &s;ees be&s;t.</P>
<P>Further, to enforce his propo&s;als, Rab&s;hakeh threatens, and produces his forces; and &s;o does Britain.</P>
<P>Rab&s;hakeh winds of with&mdash;"tru&s;t not in the Lord": And Britain affects to de&s;pi&s;e our expec|tations of <HI>help</HI> from God or from man.</P>
<P>In conclu&s;ion,</P>
<P>We may &s;ee what is right for us to do in the pre&s;ent day.</P>
<P>The Jews &s;ubmitted not&mdash;and, in his own time and way, the Lord delivered them.</P>
<P>They tru&s;ted in God; and &s;o may we&mdash;op|po&s;ing the power of God to Britain's force; his wi&s;dom to their craft; his righteou&s;ne&s;s to their inju&s;tice. Thus may we tru&s;t in the Lord, and yet hope in his mercy.</P>
<P>We hear not, indeed, how the Jews agreed in their refu&s;als to &s;ubmit. If, however, there were &s;ome, as generally in &s;imilar ca&s;es &s;ince, who were di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ubmit; they were over-ru|led in their fal&s;e humility, or wor&s;e de&s;igns.</P>
<P>May we then, prizing the gifts of heaven, feeling our own unworthine&s;s of them, and knowing whence our effectual help mu&s;t come, &s;tudy to pre&s;erve them&mdash;neither proudly tru&s;ting in our own &s;trength and de&s;erts, or, lazily and fal&s;ly, pretending tru&s;t in God; while we neglect the open paths his providence points out.</P>
<P>In the 2d Chronicles 32d Chap.&mdash;where we have an account of this &s;ame affair, we are told that "Hezekiah and the people took coun&s;el, and &s;topped the fountains of water without the
<PB N="25" REF="014615_0023_0F943385FA549A18">
city, and the brook that ran through the mid&s;t of the land". This was, doubtle&s;s, an inconve|nience to them&s;elves&mdash;to be obliged, for them|&s;elves and cattle, to depend on the walls within the city. But they cho&s;e to &s;ubmit to it, as the le&s;|&s;er evil&mdash;willing for a &s;ea&s;on to deny them&s;elves of things <HI>convenient,</HI> that they might pre&s;erve things <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI>&mdash;willing to u&s;e <HI>probable means,</HI> while they depended on God to apply tho&s;e which were effectual. Had they &s;ubmitted, or neglec|ted obvious means, under the pretence of tru&s;t|ing God; their tru&s;t would have contradicted it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Thus may we learn to do likewi&s;e. Many things are not <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> for us. But it is <HI>nece&s;&s;a|ry</HI> for us to obey the voice of that God who hath &s;aid, "<HI>if ye may be free u&s;e it rather</HI>".</P>
<P>Let us then hearken to the voice of God&mdash; the calls of ju&s;tice&mdash;the &s;ighs of our land&mdash;the example of the wi&s;e and good&mdash;and in our re&s;pec|tive &s;pheres, endeavour to &s;top the waters that would plea&s;e and &s;trengthen the enemies of our &s;ouls, and of our country&mdash;the waters of contention, ungodline&s;s, unkindne&s;s, and &s;elfi&s;h|ne&s;s; which provoke God, oppo&s;e tru&s;t in him, and tend to our own ruin. Let us endeavour to do that faithfully, whatever &s;elf-denial it co&s;t us, which demands our concurrence. Let us put our&s;elves under the protection of the univer|&s;al King, and tru&s;t in him that Rab&s;hakeh bla&s;|phemed, who&s;e laws of ju&s;tice, from the influence of de&s;igning men, Britain &s;eems at pre&s;ent di&s;|po&s;ed to neglect.</P>

<P>No doubt much is to be &s;uffered, rather than enter on the horrors of war. But though the i&s;&s;ue of war be ever doubtful: equal horrors of &s;lavery are not doubtful.</P>
<P>If ju&s;t Heaven &s;hould call us to the field; we know not yet all the enemies we &s;hall have to encounter. We are told&mdash;they will be, mo&s;t|ly or all, regular troops.</P>
<P>If large bodies act &mdash;'tis plainly nece&s;&s;ary that there &s;hould be <HI>&s;ome method</HI> in which they may act together. No doubt <HI>in this</HI> there may be, and often is, as in clothing, mere finery di&s;tinct from u&s;e. But a &s;teady &s;eries of facts prove, as well as the nature of the thing, that &s;mall comparative bodies of men, who know how to u&s;e their weapons, and act together, and &s;up|port one another &mdash;have ever been, in a long conte&s;t, far &s;uperior to tho&s;e who have ru&s;hed on, without any thing but accidental &s;upport from one another.&mdash;Witne&s;s, among a multitude of other in&s;tances, the late &s;ucce&s;s of a &s;mall part of the force of Britain, in the hands of the Ea&s;t-India Company, again&s;t a people as numerous as the inhabitants of the&s;e Colonies. Thus, al&s;o, the Ru&s;&s;ians, who have lately triumphed over the Turks, were, not long &s;ince in the large&s;t num|bers, the <HI>&s;port</HI> of the Swedes, their le&s;s nume|rous, but more expert neighbours.</P>
<P>Perhaps the time, nece&s;&s;ary to attain the e&s;|&s;entials, may not be long: but &s;ome attention and pains are &s;urely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="014615_0027_0F94338AB7BAD0B0">I think then we have rea&s;on to be thankful that a &s;pirit for <HI>military di&s;cipline</HI> prevails &s;o far in this and the neighbouring Provinces.&mdash;Tis pity there have been heats in <HI>any</HI> towns about the choice of Officers&mdash;we <HI>hear</HI> of none in this. There can be no rule in <HI>prudentials,</HI> where many are concern'd, but that the minority acquie&s;ce. At this day 'tis particularly nece&s;&s;ary. But I think we may &s;afely &s;ay, that as great difficulties have ari&s;en where Officers have been appointed in the old channel. Prudent faithful men will, however, be very cautious how they make a jarr, where &s;o much depends on union.</P>
