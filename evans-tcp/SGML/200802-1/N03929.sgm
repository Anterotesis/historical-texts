<BIBL>Rom. VIII. 32.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>He that &s;pared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how &s;hall he not with him al&s;o freely give us all Things?</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P N="1">1. HOW freely does God love the World? While we were yet Sinners, <HI>Chri&s;t died for the ungodly.</HI> While we were <HI>Dead in Sin,</HI> GOD <HI>&s;pared not his own Son, but deli|vered him up for us all.</HI> And how <HI>freely with Him</HI> does he give us all things! Verily free Grace is all and all!</P>
<P N="2">2. The Grace or Love of God, whence com|eth our Salvation, is free in all, and free for all.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It is free in all to whom it is given. It does not depend on any Power or Merit in Man: No, not in any Degree: neither in whole nor in part. It does not in any wi&s;e depend either
<PB N="8" REF="004840_0005_100DFFD3CB820B80">
on the Good Works or Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Re|ceiver: Not on any thing he has done, or any thing he is. It does not depend on his Endeavours. It does not depend on his good Tempers, or good De&s;ires, or good Purpo&s;es and Intentions: For all the&s;e flow from the Free Grace of GOD: They are the Streams only, not the Fountain. They are the Fruits of Free Grace, and not the Root. They are not the Cau&s;e, but the Effects of it. What&s;o|ever Good is in Man, or is done by Man, GOD is the Author and Doer of it. Thus is his Grace Free in all; that is, no Way depending on any Power or Merit in Man: But in GOD alone, who freely gave us his own Son, and <HI>with him freely giveth us all Things.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. But is it Free <HI>for</HI> All, as well as <HI>in</HI> All? To this &s;ome have an&s;wer'd, <Q>No: It is free only for tho&s;e whom GOD hath ordained to Life; and they are but a little Flock. The greater Part of Mankind GOD hath ordained to Death; and it is not Free for them. Them GOD hateth; and therefore before they were born, decreed they &s;hould die Eternally. And this he ab&s;olutely decreed; becau&s;e &s;o was his good Plea&s;ure: Be|cau&s;e it was his &s;overeign Will. Accordingly, they are born for this, To be de&s;troy'd, Body and Soul, in Hell. And they grow up under the irrevocable Cur&s;e of GOD, without any Po&s;|&s;ibility
<PB N="9" REF="004840_0005_100DFFD3CB820B80">
of Redemption. For what Grace GOD gives, he gives only, for this, To increa&s;e, not prevent, their Damnation.</Q></P>
<P N="5">5. This is That Decree of Prede&s;tination. But methinks I hear one &s;ay, <Q>This is not the Pre|de&s;tination which I hold. I hold only, The Election of Grace. What I believe is no more than This, That GOD, before the Foundation of the World, did elect a certain Number of Men, to be ju&s;tified, &s;anctified, and glorified. Now all the&s;e will be &s;aved, and none el&s;e. For the re&s;t of Mankind GOD leaves to them&s;elves. So they follow the Imaginations of their own Hearts, which are only evil continually, and waxing wor&s;e and wor&s;e, are at length ju&s;tly pu|ni&s;hed with everla&s;ting De&s;truction.</Q></P>
<P>Is this ALL the Prede&s;tination which you hold? Con&s;ider. Perhaps this is not ALL. Do not you believe, <Q>GOD ordained them to this very Thing?</Q> If &s;o, you believe the Whole Decree; you hold Prede&s;tination in the full Sen&s;e, which has been above de&s;cribed. But it may be, you think you do not. Do not you then believe, GOD hardens the Hearts of them that peri&s;h? Do not you believe, He (literally) hardned <HI>Pharoah'</HI>s Heart, and that for this End he rais'd him up (or created him?) Why this amounts to ju&s;t the &s;ame Thing. If you believe <HI>Pharoah,</HI> or any one Man upon
<PB N="10" REF="004840_0006_100DFFD566C57DC8">
the Earth, was created for this End, to be damn'd, you hold all that has been &s;aid of Prede&s;tination. And there is no need you &s;hould add, that GOD &s;econds his Decree, which is &s;uppo&s;ed unchange|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> and irre&s;i&s;tible, by hardening the Hearts of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Ve&s;&s;els of Wrath, whom that Decree had be|fore fitted for De&s;truction.</P>
<P N="6">6. Well; but it may be, you do not believe even this. You do not hold any Decree of Re|probation. You do not think GOD decrees any Man to be damn'd, nor hardens, irre&s;i&s;tibly fits him for Damnation. You only &s;ay, GOD eter|nally decreed, <Q>That ALL being dead in Sin, he would &s;ay to &s;ome of the Dry Bones, <HI>Live,</HI> and to others he would not. That con&s;equently, The&s;e &s;hould be made alive, and Tho&s;e abide in Death: The&s;e &s;hould glorify GOD by their Salvation, and Tho&s;e by their De&s;truction.</Q></P>
<P N="7">7. Is not this what you mean by <HI>the Election of Grace?</HI> If it be, I would a&s;k one or two Que&s;|tions. Are any who are not thus Elected, &s;aved? Or were any, from the Foundation of the World? Is it po&s;&s;ible any Man &s;hould be &s;aved, unle&s;s he be thus Elected? If you &s;ay <HI>No,</HI> you are but where you was. You are not got one Hair's-breadth further. You &s;till believe, that in con&s;e|quence of an unchangeable, irre&s;i&s;tible Decree of GOD, the greater part of Mankind abide in Death,
<PB N="11" REF="004840_0006_100DFFD566C57DC8">
without any Po&s;&s;ibility of Redemption: Ina&s;much as none can &s;ave them but GOD; And He will not &s;ave them. You believe He hath ab&s;olutely decreed, Not to &s;ave them; And what is this but decreeing to damn them? It is, in effect, neither more nor le&s;s: It comes to the &s;ame thing. For if you are dead, and altogether unable to make your &s;elf alive; then if GOD has ab&s;olutely decreed, He will make others only alive, and not you; He hath ab&s;olutely decreed your everla&s;ting Death; you are ab&s;olutely con&s;ign'd to Damnation. So then, tho' you u&s;e &s;ofter Words than &s;ome, you mean the &s;elf-&s;ame Thing. And GOD's Decree concerning the Election of Grace, according to your own Account of it, amounts to neither more nor le&s;s, than what others call, <Q>GOD's Decree of Reprobation.</Q></P>
<P N="8">8. Call it therefore by whatever Name you plea&s;e, <Q>Election, Preterition, Prede&s;tination or Reprobation,</Q> it comes in the End to the &s;ame Thing. The Sen&s;e of all is plainly this; <Q>By virtue of an Eternal, Unchangeable, Irre&s;i&s;tible Decree of GOD, One Part of Mankind are in|fallibly &s;aved, and the re&s;t infallibly damn'd: It being impo&s;&s;ible that any of the former &s;hould be damn'd, or that any of the latter &s;hould be &s;aved.</Q></P>
<P N="9"><PB N="12" REF="004840_0007_100DFFD716AF8690">
9. But if this be &s;o, then is all Preaching Vain. It is needle&s;s to them that are Elected: For they, whether with Preaching or without, will infallibly be &s;aved. Therefore the End of Preaching, "To &s;ave Souls, is void with regard to them. And it is u&s;ele&s;s to them that are not Elected: For they cannot po&s;&s;ibly be &s;aved. They whether with Preaching or without, will infallibly be damn'd. The End of Preaching is therefore void with re|gard to them likewi&s;e. So that in either ca&s;e, our Preaching is vain, as your Hearing is al&s;o vain."</P>
<P N="10">10. This then is a plain Proof, that the Doctrine of Prede&s;tination is not a Doctrine of GOD, be|cau&s;e it makes void the Ordinances of GOD: And GOD is not divided again&s;t him&s;elf. A Se|cond is, That it directly tends to de&s;troy that Ho|line&s;s, which is the End of all the Ordinances of GOD. I do not &s;ay, "None who hold it are Holy:" (For GOD is of tender Mercy to tho&s;e who are unavoidably intangled in Errors of any kind.) But that the Doctrine it &s;elf, <Q>That every Man is either Elected, or not Elected, from Eternity; and that the one mu&s;t inevitably be &s;aved, and the other inevitably damn'd,</Q> has a manife&s;t Tendency to de&s;troy Holine&s;s in general. For it wholly takes away tho&s;e fir&s;t Motives to follow after it, &s;o frequently propos'd in Scripture, the Hope of future Reward, and Fear of Puni&s;h|ment, the Hope of Heaven and Fear of Hell.
<PB N="13" REF="004840_0007_100DFFD716AF8690">
<HI>That the&s;e &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting Puni&s;hment, and tho&s;e into Life eternal,</HI> is no Motive to him to &s;truggle for Life, who believes his Lot is ca&s;t already. It is not rea&s;onable for him &s;o to do, if he thinks he is unalterably adjudged either to Life or Death. You will &s;ay, <Q>But he knows not, whether it is Life or Death.</Q> What then? This helps not the Matter. For if a &s;ick Man knows that he mu&s;t unavoidably die, or unavoidably reco|ver, tho' he knows not which, it is not rea&s;onable for him to take any Phy&s;ick at all. He might ju&s;tly &s;ay, (and &s;o I have heard &s;ome &s;peak, both in Bodily Sickne&s;s and in Spiritual) <Q>If I am or|dained to Life, I &s;hall live; If to Death, I &s;hall die: So I need not trouble my&s;elf about it.</Q> So directly does this Doctrine tend, to &s;hut the very Gate of Holine&s;s in general, to hinder unholy Men from ever approaching thereto, or &s;triving to enter in thereat.</P>
<P N="11">11. As directly does this Doctrine tend to de|&s;troy &s;everal particular Branches of Holine&s;s. Such are Meekne&s;s and Love: Love I mean of our Enemies, of the Evil and Unthankful. I &s;ay not, That none who hold it, have Meekne&s;s and Love: (For as is the Power of GOD, &s;o is his Mercy.) Put that it naturally tends to in&s;pire or increa&s;e, a Sharpne&s;s or Eagerne&s;s of Temper, which is quite contrary to the Meekne&s;s of CHRIST: As then e&s;pecially appears, when they are oppo&s;ed on this
<PB N="14" REF="004840_0008_100DFFD95543D130">
Head. And it as naturally in&s;pires Contempt or Coldne&s;s toward tho&s;e, whom we &s;uppo&s;e Outca&s;ts from GOD. <Q>O (but you &s;ay) I &s;uppo&s;e no par|ticular Man a Reprobate.</Q> You mean, you would not, if you could help it. You can't help &s;ometimes applying your General Doctrine to Par|ticular Per&s;ons. The Enemy of Souls will apply it for you. You know how often he has done &s;o. "But you rejected the Thought with Abhorrence." True: As &s;oon as you could. But how did it &s;our and &s;harpen your Spirit in the mean time? You well know, it was not the Spirit of Love, which you then felt towards that poor Sinner, whom you &s;uppo&s;ed or &s;u&s;pected, whether you would or no, to have been hated of GOD from Eternity.</P>
<P N="12">12. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> This Doctrine tends to de&s;troy the Comfort of Religion, the Happine&s;s of Chri&s;tianity: This is evident as to all tho&s;e who believe them|&s;elves to be reprobated, or who only &s;u&s;pect or fear it. All the great and precious Promi&s;es are lo&s;t to them. They afford them no Ray of Comfort: <Q>For they are not the Elect of GOD. Therefore they have neither Lot nor Portion in them.</Q> This is an effectual Bar to their finding any Com|fort or Happine&s;s even in that Religion, <Q>who&s;e <HI>Ways</HI> were de&s;igned to be <HI>Ways of Plea&s;antne&s;s, and all her Paths Peace.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="13"><PB N="15" REF="004840_0008_100DFFD95543D130">
13. And as to you who believe your&s;elves the Elect of GOD, what is your Happine&s;s? I hope, not a Notion, a &s;peculative Belief; a bare Opinion of any Kind: But a feeling Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of GOD in your Heart, wrought in you by the Holy Gho&s;t; or, <HI>The Witne&s;s of GOD's Spirit with your Spirit, that you are a Child of GOD.</HI> This otherwi&s;e term'd <HI>the full A&s;&s;urance of Faith,</HI> is the true Ground of a Chri&s;tian's Happine&s;s. And it does indeed imply, a full A&s;&s;urance, that all your pa&s;t Sins are forgiven, and that you are <HI>now</HI> a Child of GOD; But it does not nece&s;&s;arily imply, a full A&s;&s;urance of our future Per&s;everance. I do not &s;ay, This is never join'd to it: But that it is not nece&s;&s;arily imply'd therein; for many have the one, who have not the other.</P>
<P N="14">14. Now this Witne&s;s of the Spirit, Experience &s;hews to be much ob&s;tructed by this Doctrine: And not only in tho&s;e, who believing them&s;elves Reprobated, by this Belief thru&s;t it far from them: But even in them that have <HI>ta&s;ted of that good Gift,</HI> who yet have &s;oon lo&s;t it again, and fallen back into Doubts and Fears, and Darkne&s;s, <HI>Hor|rible Darkne&s;s that might be felt.</HI> And I appeal to any of you who hold this Doctrine, to &s;ay be|tween GOD and your own Hearts, whether you have not often a Return of Doubts and Fears con|cerning your Election or Per&s;everance? If you a&s;k, Who has not? I an&s;wer, Very Few of tho&s;e
<PB N="16" REF="004840_0009_100DFFDBB7933028">
that hold this Doctrine. But many, very many of tho&s;e that hold it not, in all Parts of the Earth: Many of tho&s;e who know and feel, they are in CHRIST to Day, and <HI>take no Thought for the Mor|row;</HI> who <HI>abide in him</HI> by Faith from Hour to Hour, or rather from Moment to Moment. Ma|ny of the&s;e have enjoy'd the uninterrupted Witne&s;s of his Spirit, the continual Light of his Counte|nance, from the Moment wherein they fir&s;t be|lieved, for meny Months or Years to this Day.</P>
<P N="15">15. That A&s;&s;urance of Faith which the&s;e enjoy, excludes all Doubt and Fear. It excludes all Kind of Doubt and Fear, concerning their future Per&s;e|verance: Tho' it is not properly (as was &s;aid be|fore) and A&s;&s;urance of what is Future; but only of what <HI>now</HI> is. And this needs not for its Sup|port, a &s;peculative Belief, That whoever is once ordain'd to Life, mu&s;t live. For it is wrought from Hour to Hour, by the mighty Power of <HI>GOD, by the Holy Gho&s;t which is given unto</HI> them. And therefore that Doctrine is not of GOD, be|cau&s;e it tends to ob&s;truct, if not de&s;troy, this Great Work of the Holy Gho&s;t, whence flows the chief Comfort of Religion, the Happine&s;s of Chri&s;ti|anity.</P>
<P N="16">16. Again, How uncomfortable a Thought is This, That Thou&s;ands and Millions of Men, with|out any preceding Offence or Fault of theirs, were
<PB N="17" REF="004840_0009_100DFFDBB7933028">
unchangeably doom'd to everla&s;ting Burnings? How peculiarly uncomfortable mu&s;t it be, to tho&s;e who have put on Chri&s;t! To tho&s;e who being fill'd with <HI>Bowels of Mercy, Tenderne&s;s and Compa&s;&s;ion,</HI> could even <HI>wi&s;h them&s;elves accur&s;t for their Bre|thren's Sake.</HI></P>
<P N="17">17. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> This uncomfortable Doctrine di|rectly tends to de&s;troy our Zeal for Good Works. And this it does fir&s;t, as it naturally tends (accord|ing to what was ob&s;erv'd before) to de&s;troy our Love to the greater Part of Mankind, namely, the Evil and unthankful. For whatever le&s;&s;ens our Love, mu&s;t &s;o far le&s;&s;en our De&s;ire to do them Good. This it does, &s;econdly, as it cuts off one of the &s;tronge&s;t Motives to all Acts of Bodily Mercy, &s;uch as Feeding the Hungry, Cloathing the Naked, and the like, <HI>viz.</HI> The Hope of &s;aving their Souls from Death. For what avails it to relieve their Temporal Wants, who are ju&s;t dropping into Eter|nal Fire? <Q>Well; but run and &s;natch them as Brands out of the Fire.</Q> Nay, this you &s;uppo&s;e impo&s;&s;ible. They were appointed thereunto, you &s;ay, from Eternity, before they had done either Good or Evil. You believe, it is the Will of GOD they &s;hould die. And <HI>who hath re&s;i&s;ted his Will?</HI> But you &s;ay, <Q>You do not know, whether the&s;e are elected or not.</Q> What then? If you know they are the one or the other, that they are Elected or not Elected, all your Labour is void
<PB N="18" REF="004840_0010_100DFFDDA4C859F0">
and vain. In either Ca&s;e, your Advice, Reproof, or Exhortation, is as needle&s;s and u&s;ele&s;s as our Preaching. It is needle&s;s to them that are Elected; for they will infallibly be &s;aved without it. It is u&s;ele&s;s to them that are not Elected; for with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> without it they will infallibly be damn'd. There|fore you cannot, con&s;i&s;tently with your Principles, take any Pains about their Salvation. Con&s;equent|ly, tho&s;e Principles directly tend to de&s;troy your Zeal for Good Works; for all Good Works; but particularly for the Greate&s;t of all, The Saving of Souls from Death.</P>
<P N="18">18. But, <HI>fifthly,</HI> This Doctrine not only tends to de&s;troy Chri&s;tian Holine&s;s, Happine&s;s, and Good Works, but hath al&s;o a direct and manife&s;t Ten|dency to overthrow the whole Chri&s;tian Revela|tion. The Point which the wi&s;e&s;t of the modern Unbelievers mo&s;t indu&s;triou&s;ly labour to prove, is, That the Chri&s;tian Revelation is not nece&s;&s;ary. They well know, could they once &s;hew this, the Conclu&s;ion would be too plain to be denied, <Q>If it be not Nece&s;&s;ary, it is not True.</Q> Now, this Fundamental Point you give up. For &s;uppo&s;ing That Eternal, Unchangeable Decree, One Part of Mankind mu&s;t be &s;aved, tho' the Chri&s;tian Reve|lation were not in Being: And the other Part of Mankind mu&s;t be damn'd, notwith&s;tanding that Revelation. And what would an Infidel de&s;ire more? You allow him all he a&s;ks. In making
<PB N="19" REF="004840_0010_100DFFDDA4C859F0">
the Go&s;pel thus unnece&s;&s;ary to all Sorts of Men, you give up the whole Chri&s;tian Cau&s;e. <HI>O tell it not in</HI> Gath! <HI>Publi&s;h it not in the Streets of</HI> A&s;kelon! <HI>Le&s;t the Daughters of the Uncircumci&s;ed rejoice, le&s;t the</HI> Sons of Unbelief <HI>triumph!</HI></P>
<P N="19">19. And as this Doctrine manife&s;tly and directly tends to overthrow the whole Chri&s;tian Revelation &s;o it does the &s;ame Thing, by plain Con&s;equence, in making that Revelation contradict it&s;elf. For it is grounded on &s;uch an Interpretation of &s;ome Texts (more or fewer it matters not) as flatly con|tradict all the other Texts, and indeed the whole Scope and Tenor of Scripture. For In&s;tance; The A&s;&s;erters of this Doctrine, interpret that Text of scripture, "Jacob <HI>have I loved, but</HI> E&s;au <HI>have I hated,</HI>" as implying that GOD in a literal Sen&s;e hated <HI>E&s;au,</HI> and all the Reprobated, from Eternity. Now, what can po&s;&s;ibly be a more flat Contra|diction than this, not only to the whole Scope and Tenor of Scripture, but al&s;o to all tho&s;e particular Texts, which expre&s;sly declare, "<HI>GOD is LOVE?</HI>" Again, they infer from that Text, <Q><HI>I will have Mercy on whom I will have Mercy,</HI></Q> (Rom. ix. 15.) That GOD is Love only to &s;ome Men, <HI>viz.</HI> The Elect, and that he hath Mercy for tho&s;e only: Flatly contrary to which, is the whole Tenor of the Scripture, as is that expre&s;s Declaration in particu|lar, <Q><HI>The Lord is loving unto</HI> EVERY <HI>Man, and his Mercy is over all his Works.</HI></Q>(<HI>P&s;al.</HI> cxiv. 9.)
<PB N="20" REF="004840_0011_100DFFDFF690FE80">
Again, They infer from that and the like Texts, <Q>It is not of him that willeth, neither of him that runneth, but of GOD that &s;heweth Mercy,</Q> that he &s;heweth Mercy only to tho&s;e whom he had Re|&s;pect to from all Eternity. <HI>Nay,</HI> but <HI>who replieth again&s;t GOD</HI> now?

your Interpretation of tho&s;e Scriptures al&s;o, is the whole Tenor of the New Te&s;tament; as are in particular tho&s;e Texts, <Q><HI>De&s;troy not him with thy Meat, for whom Chri&s;t died.</HI></Q> (<HI>Rom.</HI> xiv. 15.) A clear Proof that Chri&s;t died, not only for tho&s;e that we &s;aved, but al&s;o for them that peri&s;h. He is "<HI>the Saviour of the World,</HI>" (<HI>John</HI> iv. 42.)

Whatever be the Cau&s;e of their peri&s;hing, it can|not be his Will, if the Oracles of GOD are true; for they declare, <Q><HI>He is not willing that any &s;hould peri&s;h, but that all &s;hould come to Repentance.</HI></Q> (2 <HI>Pet.</HI> iii. 9.) He willeth that all Men &s;hould be &s;aved. And they, &s;econdly, declare, What is the Cau&s;e why all Men are not &s;aved; namely, that they will not be &s;aved: So our LORD expre&s;ly,

<P N="22">22. Thus manife&s;tly does this Doctrine tend to overthrow the whole Chri&s;tian Revelation, by ma|king it contradict it&s;elf; by giving &s;uch an Inter|pretation of &s;ome Texts, as flatly contradicts all the other Texts; and indeed the whole Scope and Terror of Scripture. An abundant Proof that it is not of GOD. But neither is this all. For &s;e|venthly, It is a Doctrine full of Bla&s;phemy; of &s;uch Bla&s;phemy as I &s;hould dread to mention, but that the Honour of our gracious GOD, and the Cau&s;e of his Truth, will not &s;uffer me to be &s;ilent. In the Cau&s;e of GOD then, and from a &s;incere Concern for the Glory of his Great Name, I will mention a few of the Horrible Bla&s;phemies, con|tained in this Horrible Doctrine. But fir&s;t, I mu&s;t warn every one of you that hears, as ye will an&s;wer it at the Great Day, not to charge me (as &s;ome have done) with Bla&s;pheming, becau&s;e I mention the Bla&s;phemy of others. And the more you are
<PB N="23" REF="004840_0012_100DFFE22CAA20B8">
grieved with them that do thus bla&s;pheme, &s;ee that ye <HI>confirm your Love towards them</HI> the more; and that your Heart's De&s;ire, and continual Prayer to GOD be, <HI><Q>Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.</Q></HI></P>
<P N="23">23. This premi&s;ed, let it be ob&s;erved, That this Doctrine repre&s;ents our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, JESUS CHRIST <HI>the Righteous, the only begotten Son of the Father, full of Grace and Truth,</HI> as an Hypocrite, a Deceiver of the People, a Man void of common Sincerity. For it cannot be denied, that he every where &s;peaks, <HI>as if he was</HI> willing that all Men &s;hould be &s;aved. Therefore to &s;ay, <HI>He was not</HI> willing that all Men &s;hould be &s;aved, is to repre|&s;ent him as a mere Hypocrite and Di&s;&s;embler. It can't be denied that the gracious Words which came out of his Mouth, are full of Invitations. To &s;ay then, He did not <HI>intend</HI> to &s;ave all Sinners, is to repre&s;ent him as a gro&s;s Deceiver of the People. You cannot deny, that he &s;ays, <Q><HI>Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden.</HI></Q> If then you &s;ay, He calls tho&s;e that cannot come, tho&s;e whom he knows to be unable to come; tho&s;e whom he can make able to come, but will not; how is it po&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe greater In&s;incerity? You repre|&s;ent him as mocking his helple&s;s Creatures, by of|fering what he never intends to give. You de&s;cribe him as &s;aying one Thing, and meaning another: As pretending the Love which he had not. Him,
<PB N="24" REF="004840_0013_100DFFE4A1565510">
<HI>in who&s;e Mouth was no Guile,</HI> you'll make full of Deceit, void of common Sincerity: Then e&s;pecially, when drawing nigh the City, <HI>He wept over it, and &s;aid,</HI> <Q><HI>O</HI> Jeru&s;alem! Jeru&s;alem! <HI>Thou that kille&s;t the Prophets, and &s;tone&s;t them that are &s;ent unto Thee; How often WOULD I have gathered thy Children together</HI>&mdash;<HI>and YE WOULD NOT.</HI></Q> ['Ethele&s;a kai 'uk 'ethele&s;ate.] Now, if you &s;ay, <HI>They wou'd,</HI> but <HI>He wou'd not,</HI> you repre&s;ent him (which who could hear?) as weeping Crocodiles Tears, weeping over the Prey which him&s;elf had doom'd to De&s;truction.</P>
<P N="24">24. Such Bla&s;phemy this, as one would think might make the Ears of a Chri&s;tian to tingle. But there is yet more behind; for ju&s;t as it honours the Son, &s;o doth this Doctrine honour the Father. It de&s;troys all his Attributes at once. It overturns both his Ju&s;tice, Mercy and Truth. Yea, it re|pre&s;ents the mo&s;t holy GOD as wor&s;e than the Devil; as both more fal&s;e, more cruel and more unju&s;t. More Fal&s;e; becau&s;e the Devil, Liar as he is, hath never &s;aid, <Q><HI>He willeth all Men to be &s;aved.</HI></Q> More Unju&s;t, becau&s;e the Devil can|not, if he wou'd, be guilty of &s;uch Inju&s;tice as you a&s;cribe to GOD, when you &s;ay, That GOD con|demned Millions of Souls to everla&s;ting Fire pre|pared for the Devil and his Angels for continuing in Sin, which for want of that Grace <HI>he will not</HI> give them, they cannot avoid; And more Cruel,
<PB N="25" REF="004840_0013_100DFFE4A1565510">
becau&s;e that unhappy Spirit <HI>&s;eeketh Re&s;t and findeth none;</HI> &s;o that his own re&s;tle&s;s Mi&s;ery is a kind of Temptation to him to tempt others. But <HI>GOD re&s;teth in his high and Holy Place:</HI> So that to &s;up|po&s;e him of his own mere Motion, of his pure Will and Plea&s;ure, happy as he is, to doom his Creatures, whether they will or no, to endle&s;s Mi&s;ery; is to impute &s;uch Cruelty to him, as we cannot impute even to the great Enemy of GOD and Man. It is to repre&s;ent the mo&s;t High GOD (He that hath Ears to hear, let him hear!) as more Cruel, Fal&s;e, and Unju&s;t than the Devil.</P>
<P N="25">25. This is the Bla&s;phemy clearly contained in the <HI>Horrible Decree</HI> of Prede&s;tination. And here I fix my Foot. On this I join I&s;&s;ue with every A&s;|&s;ertor of it. You repre&s;ent GOD as wor&s;e than the Devil: More Fal&s;e, more Cruel, more Unju&s;t. "But, <HI>you &s;ay,</HI> you will prove it by Scripture." Hold! What will you prove by Scripture? That GOD is wor&s;e than the Devil? It cannot be. What|ever that Scripture proves, it never can prove this. Whatever its true Meaning be, this cannot be its true Meaning. Do you a&s;k, <Q>What is its true Meaning then? If I &s;ay, I know not,</Q> you have gain'd Nothing. For there are many Scrip|tures, the true Sen&s;e whereof neither you not I &s;hall know, till Death is &s;wallowed up in Victory. But this I know, Better it were to &s;ay, It had no Sen&s;e at all; than to &s;ay it had &s;uch a Sen&s;e as this. It cannot mean, whatever it mean be&s;ides, that the
<PB N="26" REF="004840_0014_100DFFE64D2B1418">
GOD of Truth is a Lyar. Let it mean what it will, it cannot mean that the Judge of all the World is unju&s;t. No Scripture can mean, that GOD is not Love, or that his Mercy is not over all his Works. That is, Whatever it prove be&s;ide, no Scripture can prove Prede&s;tination.</P>
<P N="26">26. This is the Bla&s;phemy for which, (however I love the Per&s;ons who a&s;&s;ert it) I abhor the Doc|trine of Prede&s;tination. A Doctrine, upon the Sup|po&s;ition of which, if one could po&s;&s;ibly &s;uppo&s;e it for a Moment, (call it Election, Reprobation, or what you plea&s;e, for all comes to the &s;ame Thing) one might &s;ay to our Adver&s;ary the Devil, <Q>Thou Fool, why do&s;t thou roar about any longer? Thy lying in Wait for Souls is as needle&s;s and u&s;ele&s;s as our Preaching. Heare&s;t thou not, that GOD hath taken thy Work out of thy Hands? And that he doth it much more effectually? Thou, with all thy Principalities and Powers, can&s;t only &s;o a&s;&s;ault, that we may re&s;i&s;t thee: But he can irre&s;i&s;tibly de&s;troy both Body and Soul in Hell! Thou can&s;t only entice; but his unchangeable Decree, to leave Thou&s;ands of Souls in Death, compels them to continue in Sin, 'till they drop into everla&s;ting Burnings. Thou tempte&s;t. He forceth us to be damn'd. For we cannot re&s;i&s;t his Will. Thou Fool, why goe&s;t thou about any longer, &s;eeking whom thou maye&s;t devour? Heare&s;t thou not, that GOD is the devouring Lion, the De&s;troyer of Souls, the Murderer of

Men? <HI>Moloch</HI> cau&s;ed only Children to pa&s;s thro' the Fire; and that the Fire was &s;oon quenched&punc; or the corruptible Body being con&s;umed, its Tor|ment was at an End. But GOD, thou art told, by his Eternal Decree, fixed before they had done Good or Evil, cau&s;es not only <HI>Children of a Span long,</HI> but the Parents al&s;o to pa&s;s thro' the Fire of Hell: That <HI>Fire which never &s;hall be quenched;</HI> and the Body which is ca&s;t thereinto, being now incorruptible and immortal, will be ever con|&s;uming, and never con&s;umed: But <HI>the Smoak of their Torment,</HI> becau&s;e it is GOD's good Plea&s;ure, <HI>a&s;cendeth up for ever and ever.</HI></Q></P>
