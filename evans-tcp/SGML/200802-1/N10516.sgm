</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS is the ob&s;ervation of a wi&s;e ruler, relative to civil govern|ment; and the different ef|fects of admini&s;tration, accord|ing as it is placed in good or bad hands&mdash;and it having been pre&s;erved in the &s;acred oracles, not without provi|dential direction, equally for the advantage
<PB N="6" REF="013330_0005_0F904D8E2EFC7910">
of &s;ucceeding rulers, and other men of every cla&s;s in &s;ociety; it will not be thought im|proper by any, who have a veneration for revelation, and the in&s;truction of princes, to make it the &s;ubject of our pre&s;ent con&s;ide|ration&mdash;E&s;pecially as our civil rulers, in ac|knowledgment of a &s;uperintending Provi|dence, have invited us into the temple this morning, to a&s;k coun&s;el of God in re&s;pect to the great affairs of this anniver&s;ary, and the general conduct of government.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, I &s;hall take occa&s;ion from it&mdash;to make a few general remarks on the nature and end of civil government&mdash;point out &s;ome of the qualifications of rul|ers&mdash;and then apply the &s;ubject to the de|&s;ign of our a&s;&s;embling at this time.</P>
<P>FIRST, I &s;hall make a few remarks on the nature and end of civil government.</P>
<P>THE people mentioned are a body po|litic&mdash;But whether the &s;peaker had the Jewi&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ate more e&s;pecially in view; or, as is mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> probable, any civil &s;ociety or kingdom on earth, is a point we need not preci&s;ely determine.&mdash;On either &s;uppo&s;ition, civil government is repre&s;ented as being
<PB N="7" REF="013330_0006_0F904D8FEDEA41D8">
already e&s;tabli&s;hed among them&mdash;rule framed, and con&s;ented to, for the conduct of it&mdash;proper officers appointed, and ve&s;ted with authority, on this con&s;titutional ba&s;is, to make and execute &s;uch laws, in future, as &s;hould be found nece&s;&s;ary; the public &s;ecurity and welfare being their grand ob|ject.&mdash;This, at lea&s;t, appears to be the mo&s;t ju&s;t and rational idea of government that is founded in compact; as, I &s;uppo&s;e, all governments, not with&s;tanding later u|&s;urpations, originally were; and if the compact, in early ages, hath not always been expre&s;&s;ed, yet it has been nece&s;&s;arily implied, and under&s;tood, both by gover|nors, and the governed, on their entering into &s;ociety.</P>
<P>To this ri&s;e of government, the Hebrew polity, &s;o far as it related only to civil matters, is not to be con&s;idered as an ex|ception.&mdash;For although God, a mo&s;t per|fect Governor, for wi&s;e rea&s;ons, and as a di&s;tingui&s;hed favor, conde&s;cended to become the political head of the Jewi&s;h &s;tate; yet he did not think proper to exerci&s;e his ab|&s;olute right of government over them, with|out the con&s;ent of the people.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="013330_0007_0F904D906AA0FAA8">AND when they had fooli&s;hly and wick|edly determined to: give up this form of government, which was &s;o wi&s;ely calculat|ed for the public advantage, and &s;ub&s;titute another in its room; their alwi&s;e and be|neficent Governor did not &s;ee fit to exert his omnipotence to prevent it: Nor did he, as he ju&s;tly might, abandon them for their impiety and ingratitude.</P>
<P>BUT analagous to the methods of his moral government, he went into a mode of conduct with them, adapted to their ra|tional nature.&mdash;He treated them as free agents.&mdash;He &s;olemnly prote&s;ted again&s;t the change they were about to make in go|vernment; and, in order di&s;&s;wade them from the ra&s;h attempt, he &s;hewed them the manner of the king which &s;hould r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">gn over them. But &s;uch paternal rem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="7 letters">|ces proving ineffectual, and the people &s;till per&s;i&s;ting in their de&s;ign, He not only per|mitted them to pur&s;ue it, but actually af|forded them &s;pecial aid and direction in the choice of their new king&mdash;that they might have one who &s;hould &s;ave them from their enemies&mdash;becau&s;e their cry had come unto him.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="013330_0008_0F904D91CBC93640">THIS in in&s;tance of the unea&s;ine&s;s of the nation of the Jews, under the mo&s;t perfect form of government, may, perhaps, be al|ledged by &s;ome, as an argument of the utter incapacity of a people to judge of the rectitude of admini&s;tration, or of their un|rea&s;onable peevi&s;hne&s;s and di&s;content, when they are governed well. It ought, however, to be con&s;idered, that though God was plea&s;ed to put him&s;elf at the head of the Jewi&s;h polity, yet officers, or rulers taken from among men, were appointed to act under Him; and the&s;e might not, and in fact did not always keep the great end of their inve&s;titure in view.</P>
<P>THIS was remarkably the ca&s;e in the in&s;tance before us.&mdash;The &s;ons of Samuel, who had been appointed judges over I&s;rael, walked not in his ways, but turned a&s;ide after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment; and the evil effects of their ve|nality, and con&s;equent perver&s;ion of pub|lic ju&s;tice being known, and felt by the people, were the immediate occa&s;ion of their general unea&s;ine&s;s and complaint.</P>
<P>IN this &s;ituation of their affairs, the way, indeed, was open before them. It was
<PB N="10" REF="013330_0009_0F904D91E93FAD58">
their indi&s;pen&s;able duty, in&s;tead of with|drawing their allegiance, to have made their application to God their king, in a way of humble ardent prayer, for a redre&s;s of &s;uch enormities; and undoubtedly, He would have heard their petition, and returned an an&s;wer of peace, as He had before, in times of other dangers and di&s;tre&s;&s;es, often done.&mdash;Their &s;in and folly con&s;i&s;ted in this neg|lect, and not in groundle&s;s &s;u&s;picions, and unnece&s;&s;ary complaints: they had mani|fe&s;t cau&s;e of unea&s;ine&s;s&mdash;they were greatly injured, and oppre&s;&s;ed by &s;ome of their ex|ecutive officers: Bribery, which ought to be the abhorrence of all ranks, had cor|rupted the &s;eats of judgment, and rendered their per&s;ons and property in&s;ecure, and without the protection of law. Of this they complained, and made it the ground of their reque&s;t for a king to judge them like all the nations&mdash;And however the I&s;raelites might be guilty of great weak|ne&s;s and folly, as they certainly were, in de&s;iring, on this account, to depart from a form of government, in which God him|&s;elf pre&s;ided, and wherein they might have had all their grievances redre&s;&s;ed; and-to adopt one &s;imilar to that of other nations;&mdash;and how far &s;oever God might grant
<PB N="11" REF="013330_0010_0F904D92A74F04D0">
their de&s;ire, as a puni&s;hment of their ingra|titude, yet, as it appears from Jacob's ble&s;|&s;ing on the tribe of Judah, not to mention other things, it was in the divine plan, or permi&s;&s;ion at lea&s;t, that the Jews, in future time, &s;hould come under the governance of earthly kings, it is no improbable con|jecture, that prevailing wickedne&s;s, and corruption among &s;ome in high nation at this period, was the occa&s;ion of God's &s;o readily complying with this reque&s;t.</P>
<P>THE pa&s;&s;age, however, which &s;tands at the head of our di&s;cour&s;e, &s;uppo&s;es the peo|ple to be judges of the good or ill effects of admini&s;tration;&mdash;and as the wi&s;e king of I&s;rael is the author, it may, perhaps, have the more weight.&mdash; "When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice."&mdash;They are &s;en&s;ible of their own happine&s;s in having men of uprightne&s;s, honor and humanity to rule over them&mdash;Men, who make a proper u&s;e of their authority&mdash;who &s;eek the peace and welfare of the whole community, and govern according to law and equity, or the original rules of their con&s;titution.&mdash; "But when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn"&mdash;they are di&s;&s;atisfied and grieved, when
<PB N="12" REF="013330_0011_0F904D94B7368D50">
contrary to rea&s;onable expectation, and the de&s;ign they had in forming into civil &s;ocie|ty, it turns out, as the hi&s;tory of &s;tates and kingdoms authori&s;es us to &s;ay it often does, that their rulers po&s;&s;e&s;s oppo&s;ite qua|lities&mdash;are inhuman, tyrannical and wick|ed; and in&s;tead of guarding, violate their rights and liberties.</P>
<P>THE great end of a ruler's exaltation is the happine&s;s of the people over whom he pre&s;ides; and his promoting it, the &s;ole ground of their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to him. In this rational point of view, St. Paul, that great patron of liberty, &s;peaking of the de|&s;ign of magi&s;tracy, hath thought fit to place it&mdash;"he is the mini&s;ter of God to thee for good"&mdash;But God's mini&s;ter he cannot be, as a ruler, however he may be in ano|ther capacity, nor is &s;ubjection required, on any other principle&mdash;his making the pro&s;perity of the &s;tate the great object of his laws and other mea&s;ures of government, is his only claim to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion: Nor will any one deny that his doing &s;o, and attend|ing diligently to this very thing, binds the con&s;cience of &s;ubjects, and makes obedi|ence their indi&s;pen&s;ible duty. But obedi|ence on the contrary &s;uppo&s;ition, is &s;o far
<PB N="13" REF="013330_0012_0F904D95E893EC98">
from being enjoined on them, that it ar|gues meanne&s;s of &s;pirit, and criminal &s;ervi|lity, unle&s;s their circum&s;tances are &s;uch as to make &s;ubjection a duty, on the foot of prudence, when it is not &s;o in any other view.</P>
<P>THE mea&s;ures which rulers pur&s;ue, are generally good or bad, promotive of the public happine&s;s, or the contrary, as are their moral characters. The ob&s;ervation of our text is grounded on the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion, though it ought to be acknow|ledged, that there have been wicked rulers, &s;uch as Nero, and others of later date, who for a while, have governed well.</P>
<P>WHETHER righteou&s;ne&s;s is to be re|&s;tricted meerly to the virtue of ju&s;tice, or con&s;idered as comprehen&s;ive of the entire character of piety and religion, where it is &s;aid, as in the place before us; "when the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice"; it may ju&s;tly be affirmed that men of &s;uch a character are by far the fitte&s;t, other accompli&s;hments being equal, to be entru&s;ted with the civil intere&s;t of a com|munity; and the people are the mo&s;t like|ly to feel the &s;alutary effects of government, and be happy in their admini&s;tration.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="013330_0013_0F904D96682D2800">RELIGIOUS rulers are, in every view, ble&s;&s;ings to &s;ociety; their laws are ju&s;t and good&mdash;their mea&s;ures mild and humane&mdash;and their example morally engaging.</P>
<P>VENERATION for the authority of the &s;upreme ruler of the world, prevailing in their hearts, is the mo&s;t effectual &s;ecurity of affection to the public, which is a qua|lification ab&s;olutely indi&s;pen&s;ible&mdash;it in|&s;pires them with principles of equity and humanity; it begets the deepe&s;t concern in all their acts of government, to an&s;wer the great intention both of God and man, in their in&s;titution, and renders them truly benefactors to mankind.</P>
<P>IT is, however, natural to &s;uppo&s;e, every quality nece&s;&s;ary to the con&s;tituting a good ruler, is comprehended in the term&mdash;righ|teous&mdash;the ob&s;ervation would not, other|wi&s;e, be without exception.&mdash;The inte|re&s;t of a people is not always &s;o well &s;erv|ed by a ruler meerly of a religious charac|ter, as it would be by the addition of other qualities.&mdash;Religion, indeed, ought ever to be e&s;teemed as an indi&s;pen&s;able recommen|dation to public tru&s;t; but other qualifi|cations are al&s;o requi&s;ite, and mu&s;t be

joined, to afford rea&s;onable expectation of happine&s;s to a community, from the exer|ci&s;e of authority.</P>
<P>THERE does not appear to be a like rea&s;on for &s;uppo&s;ing the want of every other qualification, as well as that of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, in the wicked ruler, to make him incapable of governing well.&mdash;He may have many and great endowments in other re&s;pects&mdash;capacity, and addre&s;s&mdash;but if he has no religion&mdash;if he is immoral and vi|cious, unawed by him who&s;e kingdom rul|eth over all; he is commonly unfit to have the care and direction of the public intere&s;t.&mdash;If there have been in&s;tances of good government under the conduct of rulers of vicious characters, there have been al&s;o too many of a contrary &s;ort to make it eligible or &s;afe, to put Confidence in &s;uch. To whatever lengths natural benevo|lence, de&s;ire of fame, education, love of power, and the emoluments of place, may be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ometimes to carry men in acting for the public advantage, It is certain, and in &s;everal, it has been &s;adly verified, that the&s;e are feeble motives&mdash; principles, that can give no &s;ecurity of la&s;ting happine&s;s to a people, where the &s;uperior invigorating aids of religion are wanting.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="013330_0015_0F904D988A73A4D8">THE vices of a ruler pervert the due ex|erci&s;e of his authority, to the di&s;advantage of the community; and mark his public conduct with oppref&s;&s;ion and ruin. And we are not to think it &s;trange, if the peo|ple fall into perplexity and mourning in con&s;equence.</P>
<P>IT is the character of one who is exal|ted from among his brethren, to rule over men, drawn by God him&s;elf, the Almighty guardian of the Rights of mankind&mdash;that he "mu&s;t be ju&s;t, ruling in the fear of God."</P>
<P>THE &s;afety of &s;ociety greatly depends on the good di&s;po&s;ition of rulers, and the regard they have to equity in their mea|&s;ures of government. If they rule in the fear of God, they will make his laws their pattern in framing and executing their own.</P>
<P>ADMINISTRATION in every mode of government, is a point of the mo&s;t weigh|ty importance to &s;ubjects.&mdash;Ab&s;olute monarchies, or &s;uch forms of government as have the powers of the &s;tate lodged in the hands of a &s;ingle per&s;on, tho' generally dangerous to the Rights and Liberties of

mankind, and too often have proved &s;o, to recommend them to the choice of a wi&s;e people, have, notwith&s;tanding, when the reigning Prince has &s;upported the character of religion, been the &s;ource of great peace and &s;ecurity to the public.</P>
<P>But the effects have been different&mdash; di&s;tre&s;s and mi&s;ery introduced into &s;ociety, under the admini&s;tratiion of one who&s;e mo|ral qualities have been of another complex|ion.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame is true as to con&s;equences, in tho&s;e governments, where the whole pow|er, legi&s;lative and executive, is depo&s;ited with a few.&mdash;Good or evil en&s;ues to the community, according as the exerci&s;e of their authority coincides with the eternal rules and laws of rea&s;on and equity, or the contrary.</P>
<P>IN a mixed government, &s;uch as the Briti&s;h, public virtue and religion, in the &s;everal branches, though they may not be exactly of a mind in every mea&s;ure, will be the &s;ecurity of order and tranquility&mdash;Cor|ruption and vena<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ity the certain &s;ource of confu&s;ion and mi&s;ery the &s;tate.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="013330_0017_0F904D99899B1758">THIS form of government, in the opi|nion of &s;ubjects and &s;trangers, is happily calculated for the pre&s;ervation of the Rights and Liberties of mankind.&mdash;Much, howe|ver, depends on union; and the concern of every part to pur&s;ue the great ends of government.</P>
<P>WHEN each department centre their views in the &s;ame point, and act in their proper direction and character, as the mi|ni&s;ters of providence, for the promotion of human happine&s;s, things go well&mdash;the Rights of the people are &s;ecured, and they are contented&mdash;gladne&s;s fills their heart, and &s;parkles in their countenance!</P>
<P>BUT there may be a failure in &s;ome one or more of the governing parts, in re&s;pect to public mea&s;ures, and the art of govern|ing.&mdash;And when this happens, though it be but in one, &s;ince each part is &s;trictly ne|ce&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute the Iegi&s;lative body&mdash; it greatly wounds the &s;tate&mdash;embarra&s;&s;es affairs &mdash; and is productive of general unea|&s;ine&s;s and di&s;content.&mdash; The people &s;oon feel inconveniences ri&s;ing from jarrs and interference among their rulersa&mdash;and as they have an indubitable right, they take

it upon them, to judge what, and how far any thing is &s;o, and where to fix the blame.</P>
<P>IN &s;uch a government, rulers have their di&s;tinct powers a&s;&s;igned them by the peo|ple, who are the only &s;ource of civil au|thority on earth, with the view of having them exerci&s;ed for the public advantage; and in proportion as this worthy end of their inve&s;titure is kept in &s;ight, and pro|&s;ecuted, the bands of &s;ociety are &s;trength|ened, and its intere&s;ts promoted: But if it be overlooked, and di&s;regarded, and ano|ther &s;et up as the object of their pur&s;uit&mdash; we will &s;uppo&s;e it &s;hould be, but by one of the &s;upreme branches, or, indeed, by a &s;ingle member of any, who happens to be of leading influence and great abilities, it will go far in making a &s;chi&s;m in the body. &mdash;Calamity and di&s;tre&s;s may be expected, in a mea&s;ure, to en&s;ue&mdash; We need net pa&s;s the limits of our own nation for &s;ad in&s;tances of this.&mdash; Whether, or how far, it has al|&s;o been exemplified in any of the American colonies, who&s;e governments, in general, are nearly copies of the happy Briti&s;h ori|ginal, by the operation of <HI>mini&s;terial</HI> un|con&s;titutional mea&s;ures, or the public con|duct of &s;ome among our&s;elves, is not for

me to determine: It is, however, certain, that the people mourn!&mdash;May God turn their mourning into joy! and comfort them, and make them rejoice from their &s;orrow!&mdash;</P>
<P>RULERS are under the mo&s;t &s;acred ties to con&s;ult the good of &s;ociety. 'Tis the only grand de&s;ign of their appointment. For the promotion of this valuable end, they are ordained of God, and cloathed with authority by men.</P>
<P>IN a &s;tate of nature men are equal, exactly on a par in regard to authority; each one is a law to him&s;elf, having the law of God, the &s;ole rule of conduct, writ|ten on his heart.</P>
<P>No individual has any authority, or right to attempt to exerci&s;e any, over the re&s;t of the human &s;pecies, however he may be &s;uppo&s;|ed to &s;urpa&s;s them in wi&s;dom and &s;agacity. The idea of &s;uperior wi&s;dom giving a right to rule, can an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of power but to one; for on this plan the Wi&s;e&s;t of all is Lord of all. Mental endowments, though excellent qualifications for rule, when men have entered into combination

and erected government, and previous to government, bring the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors under mo|ral obligation, by advice, per&s;wa&s;ion and argument, to do good proportionate to the degrees of them; yet do not give any antecedent right to the exerci&s;e of autho|rity. Civil authority is the production of combined &s;ociety&mdash;not born with, but de|legated to certain individuals for the ad|vancement of the common benefit.</P>
<P>AND as its origin is from the people, who have not only a right, but are bound in duty, for the pre&s;ervation of the pro|perty and liberty of the whole &s;ociety, to lodge it in &s;uch hands as they judge be&s;t qualified to an&s;wer its intention; &s;o when it is mi&s;applied to other purpo&s;es, and the public, as it always will, receives damage from the abu&s;e, they have the &s;ame origi|nal right, grounded on the &s;ame funda|mental rea&s;ons, and are equally bound in duty to re&s;ume it, and transfer it to others. &mdash;The&s;e are principles which will not be denied by any good and loyal &s;ubject of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty King George, either in Great-Britain or America&mdash; The royal right to the throne ab&s;olutely depends on the truth of them, &mdash;and the revolution, an

<P>THIS po&s;ition is &s;o far from being un|acceptable to good rulers, or thought to be derogatory of their dignity, that they e&s;teem it as implying the highe&s;t human character, and an official re&s;emblance of the great Saviour of mankind, who came not to be mini&s;tered unto, but to mini&s;ter; and accordingly went about doing good.</P>

whom cometh down every good and per|fect gift; and much in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, as it is his will that men &s;hould be employed in them for their own advantage: But men by their rea&s;on, which is al&s;o the gift of God, are the immediate di&s;coverers of their utility. It is, however, nece&s;&s;ary to ob|&s;erve, that as civil government holds a di&s;|tingui&s;hed place among the gifts of God; and, con&s;idering the human make, the ble&s;&s;ings of it are productive of a greater aggregate of happine&s;s, both in a natural and moral view, than mo&s;t others: Much has been &s;aid in revelation about it&mdash;the divine approbation manife&s;ted&mdash;and the qualification of rulers exactly &s;tated.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH government is not expli|citly in&s;tituted by God, it is, neverthele&s;s, from him; as, by the human con&s;titution, and the circum&s;tances men are placed in, He has &s;ignified it to be his will, that, as a &s;ecurity of property and liberty, and as ne|ce&s;&s;ary to greater improvements in virtue and happine&s;s than could be attained in a &s;tate of nature, there &s;hould be government among them. But it is from man, as for the &s;ame end&mdash;the procuring a greater good to each individual, on the whole, than could

And &s;o the new-te&s;tament writers con&s;ider it, and &s;peak of its de&s;ign as being the &s;ame in both, viz. The public happine&s;s.</P>
<P>THIS is a &s;triking indication to rulers, not only as to their aims in accepting any public office in a community, but as to the obligations they are under to di&s;charge the duties of it with fidelity. They are the tru&s;tees of God, ve&s;ted with authority by him, in the benevolent de&s;igns of his providence, to be employed in guarding and defending the ju&s;t Rights and Liber|ties of mankind; and as far as they can, advancing the common welfare.</P>

<P>LEGISLATORS, whom I have chiefly had in view, &s;hould know how to give force, and operation to their laws, that every member of the community may feel their effects, and be treated in a ju&s;t and rea&s;onable manner; and as far as may be, according to his per&s;onal circum&s;tances and merits.

<P>IT is our ardent wi&s;h and confidence, the &s;ame vigilance, circum&s;pection and public &s;pirit, may di&s;tingui&s;h the proceed|ings of the two houses of a&s;&s;embly for the current year &mdash;that which is now return|ed, with marks or approbation and honor, from their con&s;tituents, and the other,
<PB N="42" REF="013330_0041_0F904DB14DC3C9D8">
which according to royal charter, is this day to be cho&s;en.</P>
<P>THIS anniver&s;ary, which is &s;o au&s;pici|ous to the civil liberties of this province, fills every hone&s;t heart with joy and glad|ne&s;s, and I tru&s;t with the &s;incere&s;t grati|tude to almighty God, the great patron of liberty, and benefactor of the world.</P>
<P>THE choice of per&s;ons from among our&s;elves, to &s;it at council board, both in a legi&s;lative capacity, and as his maje&s;ty's council to give their advice to his repre|&s;entative here, on all matters of govern|ment, as circum&s;tances may require, we e&s;teem a great &s;ecurity of our natural rights; and one of our mo&s;t invaluable privileges&mdash;a privilege, which we never have forfeited, and we are re&s;olved we ne|ver will, or voluntarily re&s;ign it into the hands of any of our fellowmen&mdash;though it mu&s;t be acknowledged, I &s;peak it with &s;hame and blu&s;hing, that for the many cry|ing &s;ins, and enormities committed in our land, it would be righteous in the divine government, if we were deprived of this and all our mercies.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="013330_0042_0F904DB16BCE3008">THE appointment of one to fill the chair, is, by royal charter, re&s;erved to the crown. Of this we have not been much di&s;po&s;ed to complain; for though we re|member our fir&s;t charter with affection, and the arbitrary de&s;potic manner of its di&s;&s;olution with abhorrence, yet we have been u&s;ed to put great confidence in the paternal goodne&s;s of our gracious &s;ove|reigns; and to expect &s;uch governors to be appointed over us, as would &s;eek the peace and welfare of this people; and however it might be thought po&s;&s;ible for them, in any future time to receive &s;uch orders from the higher &s;ervants of the crown, as would be incon&s;i&s;tent with our rights and privileges, we have &s;uppo&s;ed, notwith&s;tanding they would con&s;ider them|&s;elves as being under prior obligations to the king of kings, and obey God, rather than men.</P>
<P>WE have been u&s;ed to think they would e&s;teem the &s;ervice of his maje|je&s;ty within this province, and the good of the province, as being the &s;ame, and that it is as impo&s;&s;ible for his maje&s;ty to have any good in America, &s;eparate from the good of his American &s;ubjects, as it is to have any good in Great-Britain &s;eparate from the good of his Briti&s;h &s;ubjects.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="013330_0043_0F904DB234636468">THE end of government, certainly, re|quires men of &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions and &s;enti|ments to rule over this people. Preroga|tive it&s;elf is not a power to do any thing it plea&s;es, but a power to do &s;ome things for the good of the community, in &s;uch ca&s;es as promulgated laws are not able to provide for it.</P>
<P>ON the&s;e principles it is rea&s;onable to expect that his Excellency who is lately appointed to the government of this pro|vince, and of who&s;e candor and moderation we have heard with plea&s;ure, will enter on the duties of his high &s;tation, with honor to him&s;elf and advantage to the publick, and make the happine&s;s of this people the great object of his admini&s;tra|tion, which is the &s;ure&s;t way to conciliate their affections, and e&s;tabli&s;h his own au|thority. We wi&s;h his Excellency much of the divine pre&s;ence and guidance&mdash;the &s;upports of religion&mdash;and the plaudit of his final Judge.</P>
<P>THE honorable Gentlemen, who are, this day, to he concerned in the exerci&s;e of an important charter privilege, the election of his Maje&s;ty's Council, will not,
<PB N="45" REF="013330_0044_0F904DB56A808610">
'tis pre&s;umed, be unmindful of the very intere&s;ting nature of this publick tran&s;ac|tion, nor how far its influence may ex|tend.</P>
<P>MUCH lies at &s;take, honored Fathers&mdash;much depends, and will probably turn on the choice you make of Councellors, not to this province only, but to the re&s;t of the colonies. In the pre&s;ent &s;cenes of ca|lamity and perplexity, when the conte&s;t in regard to the rights of the coloni&s;ts, ri&s;es high, every colony is deeply intere&s;ted in the public conduct of every other.</P>
<P>THE happy union and &s;imilarity of &s;entiment and mea&s;ures which take place thro' the continent in regard to our com|mon &s;ufferings, and which have added weight to the American cau&s;e, mu&s;t be cheri&s;hed by every prudent and con&s;tituti|onal method, and will, we tru&s;t, meet with your countenance and cultivation.</P>
<P>THE acknowledged weight of the Council Board, in the government of this province, and its influence into the well|being of our churches, from its connection with, and in&s;pection over a very re&s;pecta|ble

&s;eminary of learning, are not your only motives. But the united voice of America, with the &s;olemnity of thunder and with accents piercing as the lightning, awakes your attention, and demands fidelity.</P>
<P>THE ancient advice dictated to Mo&s;es, by the prie&s;t of Midian, and approved of God, is admirably calculated, civil Fathers, for your direction on this occa&s;ion&mdash;Tis a &s;ignificant compendium of the qualifi|cations of the per&s;ons whom you ought to favor with your &s;uffrages.&mdash;Thou &s;halt provide out of all the people, able men&mdash;&s;uch as fear God, men of truth, and hat|ing covetou&s;ne&s;s, and place &s;uch over them.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ent &s;ituation of our public affairs requires good degrees of knowledge, firmne&s;s of &s;pirit, patriotism, and the fear of God, in tho&s;e who &s;tand at helm and guide the &s;tate&mdash;they &s;hould be men able to investigate the &s;ource of our evils, point out adequate remedies, and that have re|&s;olution and public &s;pirit to apply them.</P>
<P>OUR danger is not vi&s;ionary, but real&mdash;Our contention is not about trifles, but
<PB N="47" REF="013330_0046_0F904DB6B68CFB28">
about liberty and property; and not ours only, but tho&s;e of po&s;terity, to the late&s;t generations. And every lover of mankind will allow that the&s;e are important ob|jects, too ine&s;timably precious and valu|able enjoyments to be treated with neglect, and tamely &s;urrendered:&mdash;For however &s;ome few, I &s;peak it with regret and a&s;to|ni&s;hment, even from among our&s;elves, appear &s;ufficiently di&s;po&s;ed to ridicule the rights of America, and the liberties of &s;ubjects; 'tis plain St. Paul, who was a good judge, had a very different &s;en&s;e of them&mdash;"He was on all occa&s;ions for &s;tanding fa&s;t, not only in the liberties with which Chri&s;t had made him free, from the Jewi&s;h law of ceremonies, but al&s;o in that liberty, with which the laws of nature, and the Roman &s;tate, had made him free from oppre&s;&s;ion and tyranny."</P>
<P>IF I am mi&s;taken in &s;uppo&s;ing plans are formed, and excuting, &s;ubver&s;ive of our natural, and charter rights, and privi|leges, and incompatible with every idea of liberty, all America is mi&s;taken with me.</P>
<P>OUR continued complaints&mdash;Our re|peated, humble, but fruitle&s;s, unregarded
<PB N="48" REF="013330_0047_0F904DB76FC63598">
petitions and remon&s;trances&mdash;and if I may be allowed the &s;acred allu&s;ion, our groan|ings, which cannot be uttered, are at once indications of our &s;ufferings, and the feel|ing &s;en&s;e we have of them.</P>
<P>WE think we are injured&mdash;We believe we are denied &s;ome of tho&s;e privileges, enjoyed by our fellow &s;ubjects in <HI>Great|Britain,</HI> which have not only been in&s;ured to us by Royal Charter, but which we have a natural independent right to.</P>
<P>AND it bears the harder on our &s;pirits, when we recollect the deep inwrought affection we have always had for the pa|rent &s;tate&mdash;our well known loyalty to our Sovereign, and our unremitting attachment to his illu&s;trious hou&s;e, as well as the in|effable toils, hard&s;hips and dangers which our Fathers endured, una&s;&s;i&s;ted, but by Heaven, in planting this American wilder|ne&s;s, and turning it into a fruitful field!</P>
<P>BUT in &s;uch circum&s;tances, we place great confidence in the wi&s;dom and patrio|ti&s;m of our civil rulers&mdash;Our eyes are fix|ed on them, and under the &s;miles of Hea|ven we expect a redre&s;s of our grievances

by their in&s;trumentality. Or, at lea&s;t, that they will not be wanting, in any thing in their power, con&s;i&s;tent with the duties of their &s;tation, to effect it.</P>
<P>WE &s;incerely hope, and tru&s;t, the elec|tions of this day will turn on men, who &s;hall be di&s;po&s;ed in their proper depart|ment to re&s;tore and e&s;tabli&s;h our rights&mdash;Men acquainted with the &s;everal powers ve&s;ted in the honorable board, and deter|mined, with per&s;evering &s;pirit, to a&s;&s;ert and uphold them&mdash;Men, in every view, friend|ly to the con&s;titution of government in this province, and re&s;olved to maintain it, undimini&s;hed, and entire.</P>
<P>YOU will plea&s;e to remember, Gentle|men, that in this weighty affair, you do not act meerly for your&s;elves&mdash;you act for the whole community&mdash;every member has an intere&s;t in the tran&s;action.</P>
<P>BUT above all, &s;uffer me to remind you, that you act for God, and under his in|&s;pection, by who&s;e providence, this tru&s;t is committed to you&mdash;and that you mu&s;t one day give an account to Him who&s;e eyes are as a flame of fire, of the motives of your conduct.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="013330_0049_0F904DB9078FDA20">WHEN the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day is fini&s;hed;&mdash;the legi&s;lative body will enquire into the interior &s;tate of the province, and enter upon public concerns relative to the well ordering, and directing its affairs.</P>
<P>BUT whether circum&s;tances require any new laws to be enacted, or new regu|lations, in any re&s;pect, made, we wil|lingly refer to the &s;uperior wi&s;dom and conduct of the guardians of our common intere&s;t&mdash;I would, however, take the libe|rty to &s;ay, that the public good, the peace, and pro&s;perity of this province, ought ever to lie near your hearts, and be kept in view, as the pole &s;tar, by which all your debates, and governmental acts, are to be directed.</P>
<P>AND if you can do any thing more effectual, than has yet been done; to pre|vent the too general prevalence of vice, and immorality, and promote the know|ledge and practice of religion and godline&s;s among us, you will perform great good &s;ervice for the public&mdash;you will, hereby, give us the highe&s;t rea&s;on to hope, and believe, that our infinitely good and gra|cious God, the tenor of who&s;e providence, hath always, from the beginning, and re|markably

in the days of our New-England progenitors, been favorable to his people, in times of calamity and darkne&s;s, will make bare his arm, and deliver us from our public embarra&s;&s;ments&mdash;Righteou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a nation&mdash;but &s;in is the reproach, and if continued, will be the ruin of any people.</P>
<P>BUT if you can do no more for &s;o ex|cellent a purpo&s;e; let us, notwithstanding, for your own &s;akes, and for ours, be a&s;&s;ured of the benefit of your example.</P>
<P>WE are ea&s;ily led by the example of our &s;uperiors, whom we re&s;pect and revere, and when it is turned on the &s;ide of reli|gion and virtue, it cannot fail of happy influence into the religion of our minds, and the morality of our lives.</P>
<P>DID men of exalted &s;tations and cha|racters, con&s;ider how much it is in their power to reform or corrupt the age, &mdash;the lower ranks and cla&s;&s;es of mankind, we might expect a conduct from them, that would teach us to connect the ideas of greatne&s;s and religion, &mdash;at lea&s;t, more nearly than we too generally have done.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="013330_0051_0F904DBB0A4610E0">WE are therefore, willing to think, us we &s;incerely wi&s;h, that from a proper zeal for the divine glory, and a generous re|gard to their fellow men, our civil fathers will go before us in the uniform practice of pure religion, and undefiled, before God and the Father.</P>
<P>UNDER the admini&s;tration of rulers of &s;uch a character, we &s;hall not rejoice meer|ly in a civil view, but in the pro&s;perity of our &s;ouls &s;hall we be glad, and rejoice before God, exceedingly.</P>
<P>BEFORE I clo&s;e, I may not omit put|ting the whole body of this people in mind to be &s;ubject to principalities and powers, and to obey magi&s;trates.</P>
<P>THIS is the direction given to Titus by the &s;ame Apo&s;tle, who in another Epi&s;tle has limited the obedience of &s;ubjects, to &s;uch rulers as an&s;wer the end of their appointment; the like limitation is there|fore to be under&s;tood here&mdash;To &s;uch ma|gi&s;trates as rule well, who are a terror, not to good works, but to the evil, which is the rea&s;on St. Paul has a&s;&s;igned why &s;ubjects are obliged, in point of con&s;cience, to &s;ubmit to them&mdash;to &s;uch magi&s;trates, I &s;ay, the mo&s;t
<PB N="53" REF="013330_0052_0F904DBB271DFE08">
chearful obedience is due from the people, as being the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings &s;ociety can enjoy&mdash;and to withhold obedience from &s;uch, is the greate&s;t of crimes, as it directly tends to public confu&s;ion and ruin.</P>
<P>As a people we have ever been remark|ably tender both of our civil and religious liberties; and 'tis hoped, the fervor of our regard for them, will not cool, till the &s;un &s;hall be darkened, and the moon &s;hall not give her light.</P>
<P>BUT ju&s;tice to our&s;elves requires us to &s;ay that we have been as remarkable for our &s;teady, uniform &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to tho&s;e who have had the rule over us.</P>
<P>IF it &s;hould be affirmed that no in|&s;tance of general complaint and unea&s;ine&s;s has been known among us from the &s;et|tlement of our Fathers in America, but when our liberties have been evidently &s;truck at, I believe, impartial hi&s;tory would &s;upport the &s;entiment.</P>
<P>IF we have complained, we have had too manife&s;t occa&s;ion for it; and all writers on government but tho&s;e of a rank, arbitrary, popi&s;h complexion, allow of complaints, and remon&s;trances, and even
<PB N="54" REF="013330_0053_0F904DBBEE8C2B10">
oppo&s;ition to mea&s;ures, in free govern|ments, which the people know to be wrong; and indeed were not this the ca&s;e, there would &s;oon be no &s;uch governments on earth.</P>
<P>THE people in this province, and in the other colonies, love and revere civil government&mdash;they love peace and order&mdash;but they are not willing to part with any of tho&s;e rights and privileges, for which they have, in many re&s;pects, paid very dear.</P>
<P>THE &s;oil we tread on is our own, the heritage of our Fathers, who purcha&s;ed it by fair bargain of the natives, unle&s;s I mu&s;t except a part, which they afterwards, in their own ju&s;t defence, obtained by conque&s;t&mdash;We have therefore an exclu|&s;ive right to it.</P>
<P>FOR, how far &s;oever di&s;covery may operate, in acquiring a right in wild unin|habited countries; every one mu&s;t allow it could acquire none in this inhabited, as it was, who is not willing to grant, that the natives of America would have acquired as good a right to Great Britain or any part of Europe, if their navigation had been able, at the same time, to have wa&s;ted them in &s;ight of it.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="013330_0054_0F904DBCAABBD1C0">BUT while we are di&s;po&s;ed to affert our rights, and hold our liberties &s;acred, let us not decline from our former temper, and de&s;pi&s;e government; but may we al|ways be ready to e&s;teem and &s;upport it, in its true&s;t dignity and maje&s;ty. Let us re&s;|pect and honor our civil rulers, and as much as po&s;&s;ible lighten their burdens by a chearful obedience to their laws, without which the great end of government, this public &s;afety and happine&s;s, cannot be promoted.</P>
<P>UNDER the pre&s;&s;ing, growing weight of our public troubles and difficulties, our hearts, tho' perplexed, have not fainted&mdash;We wait for the &s;alvation of God&mdash;It is better to tru&s;t in the Lord than to put con|fidence in princes&mdash;Let us go on to tru&s;t in him, 'till God him&s;elf &s;hall ri&s;e to &s;ave us&mdash;Let us not divide and crumble into parties, on little irregularities, which, how|ever aggravated by &s;ome, are, in cir|cumstances, almo&s;t unavoidable. But may we have that wi&s;dom which is profitable to direct, and di&s;tingui&s;h between what has, and what has not, a tendency to `re|move our burdens, and prolong our ju&s;t rights' and liberties; e&s;pecially, let us be on our guard against a &s;pirit of licentiou&s;|ne&s;s,

which is the reproach of true liberty, and has been the overthrow of free go|vernments.</P>

<P>IF this important consideration was duly impre&s;&s;ed on the minds of all ranks and orders of men, it would lead us to acquire and cultivate the &s;pirit of the go&s;|pel, which is a &s;pirit of love and benevo|lence, and beget a conduct, which while it ripens us thro' grace for immortality and glory, would be greatly promotive of the pre&s;ent benefit of human &s;ociety.&mdash;</P>
<P>AND when, by the efficacious influence of the ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirit our rational and im|mortal part is e&s;tabli&s;hed in its ju&s;t supre|macy&mdash;when appetites and pa&s;&s;ions are &s;ubject to its authority, and, our de|sires regular, mode&s;t &amp; ju&s;t&mdash;Then &s;hall our righteou&s;ne&s;s go forth as brightne&s;s and our &s;alvation as a lamp that burneth.</P>
