<P>This is plainly &s;et forth before us, in Matt. 19.13, 14, 15.&mdash; Tho&s;e Per&s;ons, who bro't the&s;e <HI>Children,</HI> &s;hew'd their Love to, and Faith in, <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> but the Di&s;ciples rebuked them; probably, thinking it to be <HI>below</HI> their Ma&s;ter, to regard <HI>Children</HI>; or el&s;e, that he had Work enough be&s;ides: But, for what Rea&s;on &s;oever they did it, yet <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was <HI>di&s;plea&s;ed</HI> with them for it, and &s;aid, <HI>Suffer little Children to come to me, and forbid them not, for of &s;uch is the Kingdom of Heaven:</HI> Yea, and he actually <HI>laid his Hands on them,</HI> in token of his <HI>ble&s;&s;ing them</HI>: "And thus, our Lord a&s;&s;erted the Rights of the <HI>Lambs</HI> of his Flock: To them be|long the Privileges of vi&s;ible Church-Mem|ber&s;hip, as among the <HI>Jews</HI> of old;" for, &s;ays our <HI>Saviour, of &s;uch is the Kingdom of Heaven:</HI> They are Members of the vi&s;ible Church, being Children of believing Pa|rents: Now, the <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> is to &s;uch <HI>Pa|rents,</HI> and to their <HI>Children.</HI> Acts 2.39.&mdash;It is very plain, that the&s;e <HI>Children,</HI> who were bro't to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> were <HI>&s;mall</HI>; even, &s;o little, as to be bro't in the Arms; probably, they
<PB N="19" REF="004413_0015_100D50111A86DCF0">
were a Year or two old, or le&s;s: And it is as plain, that they were <HI>very welcome</HI> to <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI>&mdash; Which by the Way, affords a ve|ry weighty Argument for <HI>Infant Bapti&s;m</HI>: &mdash; But, not to in&s;i&s;t upon that at pre&s;ent, but to come to what I intend; I may argue thus,</P>
<P>If <HI>Chri&s;t welcom'd little Children,</HI> when they were <HI>bro't</HI> to him <HI>by others</HI>; doubtle&s;s, it is <HI>plea&s;ing to him,</HI> when <HI>Children come</HI> to him <HI>them&s;elves</HI> and do <HI>actually</HI> and <HI>volunta|rily</HI> join in the Exerci&s;es of <HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Prai&s;e,</HI> giving to him the glory due to his Name, and waiting upon him for his Ble&s;|&s;ing: If the <HI>Lord Je&s;us</HI> will <HI>accept</HI> of <HI>Chil+dren,</HI> when offered and dedicated by their <HI>Parents</HI>; without Que&s;tion, he will accept of them, when <HI>they pre&s;ent them&s;elves,</HI> an Offering unto the Lord Pious Parents de|vote their <HI>Children</HI> to the Lord, <HI>de&s;iring,</HI> that they may be his; but when the <HI>Children</HI> pre&s;ent <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> it is &s;uppo&s;ed that they are <HI>determined</HI> to be his. In the <HI>parental</HI> Dedi|cation, <HI>Children</HI> are meerly <HI>pa&s;&s;ive,</HI> but in the <HI>Self</HI>-Dedication, they are <HI>active</HI>; and we would hope, <HI>&s;incere</HI> too, in Obedience to that Command, which is written in Prov. 23 26 MY SON, GIVE ME THINE HEART.</P>
<P N="3">3. I might al&s;o mention, by Way of Ar|gument, the <HI>Pleas,</HI> which <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> hath been plea&s;ed to put into the <HI>Mouths</HI> of <HI>Children.</HI> &mdash; I &s;hall ju&s;t hint at one or two of them.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="004413_0016_100D5012A41A08F0">Thus, they have their <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> to plead with <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> for his Acceptance of them: This Ordinance is admini&s;tred to the <HI>Infants</HI> of believing Parents; and is done, as we conceive, by the Order and Appointment of our <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Saviour</HI>: And it both lays Per&s;ons under Engagements to be his Ser|vants, and gives <HI>them Ground</HI> to hope for, and expect, his Acceptance and Ble&s;&s;ing, when <HI>they</HI> make it their great <HI>Care</HI> to <HI>fulfill</HI> tho&s;e Engagements.</P>
<P>Furthermore, <HI>they</HI> have a <HI>&s;pecial</HI> Word of <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> put into their Mouths, to plead with <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> Such as that, in Prov. 8.17. <HI>They that &s;eek me</HI> EARLY, <HI>&s;hall find me.</HI> And that, in I&s;a. 45.19. <HI>I &s;aid not unto the</HI> SEED <HI>of Jacob, &s;eek ye me in vain</HI> And many other that might be named.&mdash;</P>
<P>Now, I &s;ay, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> having furni&s;hed <HI>Chil|dren</HI> with <HI>&s;uch Pleas,</HI> it argues, that it is <HI>plea&s;ing</HI> to him, when they improve them in the Ways of divine Appointment; and par|ticularly, in the Duty of <HI>Prayer</HI>&mdash;.</P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>Truth</HI> of the Doctrine is further evident, from the Con&s;ideration, that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> has <HI>commanded</HI> his <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> to feed his <HI>Lambs:</HI></P>
<P>This may be &s;een, in <HI>John</HI> 21.15. Which Words were directed, not to <HI>Peter only,</HI> but, do al&s;o concern <HI>all</HI> tho&s;e, who &s;erve in the Work and Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Mini&s;try. &mdash; And truly, not only Mini&s;ters, but al&s;o <HI>Parents,</HI> and even <HI>all</HI> who have the
<PB N="21" REF="004413_0016_100D5012A41A08F0">
<HI>Care</HI> of <HI>Children,</HI> are obliged to train them up in the Way they &s;hould go; and to bring them up in the Nurture and Admoni|tion of the Lord.&mdash; Now, doubtle&s;s, the&s;e Things argue, that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is <HI>plea&s;ed,</HI> when <HI>Children</HI> engage in religious Exerci&s;es <HI>them|&s;elvos.</HI> &mdash; The <HI>Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> would have <HI>Children</HI> in&s;tructed by his Mini&s;ters, and by their Parents, and others, who have them under their Watch, for <HI>this very End, viz.</HI> that they may be led, <HI>actually,</HI> to en|gage in his Service them&s;elves. He would have them to know their Duty, in order to do it: And <HI>the &s;ooner</HI> they under&s;tand, de|light in, and practi&s;e their Duty, <HI>the more</HI> do they <HI>plea&s;e</HI> and <HI>gratify</HI> the <HI>Lord Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5 It is agreable to <HI>Scripture Prophecies</HI> and <HI>Promi&s;es,</HI> that <HI>Children</HI> &s;hould bring Prai&s;e to the Name of God, by <HI>their Devo|tions.</HI></P>
<P>See for this Purpo&s;e, that fore-cited P&s;al. 8.2. <HI>Out of the Mouth of Babes and Suck|lings, ha&s;t thou ordained Strength</HI>; or, <HI>per|fected Prai&s;e,</HI> as in our Context. And agre|able hereto, is that in I&s;a 44 3, 4, 5 <HI>I will pour my Spirit upon thy Seed, and my Ble&s;&s;ing upon thine Offspring, and they &s;hall &s;pring up as among the Gra&s;s, as Willows by the Water-Cour&s;es; One &s;hall &s;ay, I am the Lord's; and another &s;hall call him&s;elf by the Name of Jacob; and another &s;hall &s;ub&s;cribe with his Hand unto the Lord, and &s;irname him&s;elf by the Name of I&s;rael.</HI> &mdash; Now I &s;ay,
<PB N="22" REF="004413_0017_100D5014C99913B8">
it is abundantly evident, from &s;uch like Promi&s;es and Prophecies, that the <HI>Devotions</HI> of <HI>Children</HI> are <HI>plea&s;ing</HI> to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> He is <HI>greatly delighted,</HI> when the holy Scriptures are fulfilled, e&s;pecially, the <HI>promi&s;&s;ory</HI> Part, or, that which brings Glory to his Name, and, at the &s;ame Time, holds forth Grace and Favour to the Children of Men.</P>
<P N="6">6 It al&s;o appears from <HI>Chri&s;t's inclining</HI> and <HI>di&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ing &s;ome Children</HI> to <HI>religious</HI> Exer|ci&s;es, that, <HI>he is plea&s;ed,</HI> when <HI>they</HI> are <HI>&s;o</HI> engaged.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate this, con&s;ider briefly,</P>
<P>It is a very common Thing for <HI>Children</HI> to delight in <HI>Play</HI>; and it is very natural for them to <HI>Sin,</HI> they even incline to it, as the Sparks to fly upwards: From hence it fol|lows, that they are naturally <HI>aver&s;e</HI> to the religious Exerci&s;es of <HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Prai&s;e</HI>: They are corrupt, each one, for that which is born of the Fle&s;h is Fle&s;h; and the car|nal Mind is Enmity again&s;t God. &mdash; So then, we may conclude, that whenever <HI>Children</HI> do freely and voluntarily engage in <HI>religious</HI> Exerci&s;es, that it is CHRIST, who, by the Operations of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t, inclines</HI> them thereunto. &mdash; Ala&s;s! How many <HI>Children</HI> are there, who are well in&s;tructed, and yet, don't incline to &s;eek and &s;erve the <HI>Lord!</HI> May we not then look upon it, as the Work of the <HI>Lord,</HI> when <HI>&s;ome</HI> are <HI>thus</HI> inclined; and e&s;pecially, if <HI>they continue</HI> in
<PB N="23" REF="004413_0017_100D5014C99913B8">
the Way of Well-doing? Doubtle&s;s, we may&punc; and we ought, to account it to be the <HI>Doing</HI> of the <HI>Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Now I &s;ay, if it is <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> who by his <HI>Spirit, inclines Children</HI> to <HI>religious</HI> Exerci&s;es, then, without Que&s;tion, he is <HI>plea&s;ed</HI> with <HI>their Devotions:</HI> For, he would have all, old and young, to <HI>regard</HI> the Motions and Strivings of the Holy <HI>Spirit.</HI> Hence it is &s;aid in 1 The&s;. 5.19 <HI>Quench not the Spirit.</HI> And in Eph. 4 30 <HI>Grieve not the holy Spirit of God.</HI> And agreable to this, we find, that it is ve|ry offen&s;ive to God, when Per&s;ons are <HI>&s;o &s;tiff-necked,</HI> as <HI>to re&s;i&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> Acts. 7.15.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add,</P>
<P N="7">7. and la&s;tly. As the <HI>fir&s;t ripe</HI> Fruits are, ordinarily, of greate&s;t Account among Men, even &s;o, <HI>early</HI> Religion is mo&s;t highly plea&s;|ing unto the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>We find that it was an Ordinance of old, Exod 22 29 <HI>Thou &s;halt not delay to offer the fir&s;t of thy ripe Fruits</HI>&mdash;: Which teaches us, that <HI>little Children</HI> may <HI>not delay</HI> to offer unto God, the <HI>fir&s;t Fruits</HI> of their <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Strength,</HI> for with <HI>&s;uch</HI> Sacrifices <HI>God</HI> is <HI>well plea&s;ed,</HI> yea, the Lord accepts them with a &s;weet Savour. &mdash; We read al&s;o in Gen. 4.4. <HI>That Abel brought of the Fir&s;tlings of his Flock, and of the Fat thereof</HI>&mdash;: Which teaches us, that it is a good Thing for <HI>Chil|dren</HI> to be well taught, and train'd up <HI>be|times</HI> in <HI>religious</HI> Services (as Abel was) that &s;o, when they come to be capable of acting

for them&s;elves, they may, of their own Ac|cord (as Abel did) bring an Offering to the Lord: Yea, "and he was <HI>curious</HI> in the Choice of his Offering, for he bro't not the Lame, or the Lean, or the Refu&s;e, but the <HI>Fir&s;tlings</HI> of the Flock, the <HI>be&s;t</HI> he had, and the <HI>Fat</HI> thereof; that is, the <HI>be&s;t</HI> of tho&s;e be&s;t."

Truly very well; for it is added, that <HI>the Lord had Re&s;pect unto Abel, and to his Offering.</HI>&mdash; And indeed, it holds true to this very Day, <HI>viz</HI> That all &s;uch who &s;in|cerely offer the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> and <HI>be&s;t</HI> of what they <HI>have,</HI> and <HI>can do,</HI> unto the Lord <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> they &s;hall be <HI>accepted</HI> of him, which is the Thing principally to be aim'd at in <HI>all</HI> Acts of Re|ligion: Yea, he hath a <HI>&s;pecial Delight</HI> in all &s;uch <HI>little Ones,</HI> who truly fear and &s;erve him: Not only is there Joy in the Pre&s;ence of the <HI>Angels</HI> of God over &s;uch, but the <HI>Lord of Glory him&s;elf takes Plea&s;ure</HI> in them, and <HI>his Delights</HI> are with <HI>the&s;e</HI> Sons and Daugh|ters of Men.</P>

<P>What you have heard, may &s;uffice to &s;how, that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is <HI>well plea&s;ed</HI> with the <HI>Prayers</HI> and <HI>Prai&s;es</HI> of <HI>Children.</HI></P>

<P N="2">II. To give you the <HI>Rea&s;ons, why Chri&s;t</HI> is plea&s;ed and gratified with the Prayers and Prai&s;es of <HI>Children.</HI></P>
<P>Which I &s;hall little more than mention; <HI>namely,</HI> Becau&s;e it is <HI>eminently</HI> for the <HI>Honour</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and for the <HI>Children's Good,</HI> that <HI>they</HI> be <HI>thus</HI> employed I &s;ay,</P>
<P>It will redound to the <HI>Honour</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> when <HI>Children</HI> are found to be <HI>thus inclined</HI> and di&s;po&s;ed; for it will be readily acknowledged by People, to be the <HI>Doing</HI> of the <HI>Lord,</HI> as was before hinted; and will appear <HI>wondrous</HI> in <HI>their Eyes:</HI> It will cau&s;e <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and his <HI>Religion,</HI> to be taken the <HI>greater</HI> Notice of by Men of <HI>Fi|gure</HI>; and even, by all, who are <HI>more i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Years:</HI> Yea, and it has a great Tendency to <HI>put them to Shame,</HI> for <HI>their</HI> Neglect, and to excite <HI>them</HI> to redeem Time; which if they are bro't to do, it will be <HI>much</HI> to the <HI>Honour</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as well as for their own Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Furthermore, <HI>well di&s;po&s;ed Children</HI> are <HI>mo&s;t likely</HI> to <HI>continue</HI> in the Service of God, and to <HI>abound</HI> in well-doing; which if they

do, they'll <HI>greatly honour Chri&s;t,</HI> as al&s;o, lay up in Store <HI>for them&s;elves</HI> again&s;t the Time to come. Now, I &s;ay, Per&s;ons are <HI>mo&s;t likely</HI> to <HI>abide</HI> in <HI>that</HI> Service, which they <HI>early</HI> engage in. Agreably we read, in Prov. 22.6. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ain up a Child in the Way he &s;hould go and when he is old, he will not depa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> from it,</HI> And the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> &s;peaks of &s;uch as are <HI>plant|ed</HI> in God's Hou&s;e, that they &s;hall <HI>&s;till</HI> bring forth Fruit in old Age. P&s;al 92 13, 14. <HI>Still</HI> bring forth Fruit &mdash; that is they &s;hall <HI>continue to do, as they have done</HI> &mdash;Hence then, it follows, that God will be <HI>greatly</HI> glorified by <HI>them,</HI> in that <HI>they</HI> will bear <HI>much</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> it; for, <HI>their</HI> virtuous Actions and pious Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rci&s;es will be <HI>frequently</HI> repeated: <HI>The &s;ooner</HI> Per&s;ons begin to do well, the more Days they have to &s;pend in the Service of God; and the more Days they have to &s;pend, the more Duties are to be perform|ed; and the more Duties they perform, the more <HI>Glory</HI> will redound to the Name of God. In a Word;</P>
<P>It is undeniable, that <HI>Sin</HI> is the abomina|ble Thing which the Soul of God hates: It is <HI>this</HI> by which his holy Law is violat|ed, and his curious Workman&s;hip in his Creature, Man, abu&s;ed: It is <HI>this,</HI> and this <HI>alone,</HI> which reflects <HI>Di&s;honour</HI> to the Name of God: So then; for Per&s;ons to devote them|&s;elves to the Service of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in their <HI>early</HI> Days, mu&s;t needs be very <HI>plea&s;ing</HI> to him; be|cau&s;e

<P>And I may add;</P>
<P>That when we behold <HI>Children religiou&s;|ly di&s;po&s;ed,</HI> we have a fair <HI>Pro&s;pect</HI> of <HI>Re|ligion's</HI> being <HI>tran&s;mitted</HI> and <HI>propagated</HI> to tho&s;e, who are yet <HI>to be born</HI>; and that <HI>they al&s;o,</HI> &s;hall be to the <HI>Lord,</HI> for <HI>a Name</HI> and <HI>a Prai&s;e:</HI> Which Pro&s;pect moves the Peo|ple of God to <HI>ble&s;s</HI> and <HI>magnify</HI> his holy <HI>Name</HI>; as al&s;o, mini&s;ters much <HI>Joy</HI> and <HI>Comfort</HI> unto <HI>them</HI>; for truly, this is their great De&s;ire, that <HI>&s;uch</HI> may &s;urvive them, who &s;hall be counted to the Lord, for a <HI>Ge|neration</HI>; yea, that the Name of the Lord may have <HI>Glory</HI> from the Children of Men, even unto <HI>all</HI> Generations.</P>

<P>None &s;hall loo&s;e any Thing, at long run, by being religious: <HI>In keeping God's Com|mandments there is great Reward</HI>; as might be &s;hewn in a <HI>few Particulars.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.)

But don't mi&s;take me, for I don't intend, that <HI>all</HI> the <HI>Children</HI> of <HI>God</HI> &s;hall certainly live <HI>to Old-Age</HI>: Many, who are regenerate, without Doubt, die in their <HI>Infancy</HI>; and other gra|cious Ones have been taken out of the World in their <HI>Childhood,</HI> &s;oon after they were ca|pable of expre&s;&s;ing their Hatred of Sin, and their Love to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and his Commandments: Others in their <HI>Youth,</HI> &s;oon after they have <HI>begun</HI> to &s;erve God, and their Generation in the World. And thus it is, <HI>partly</HI> in Wrath, for the Puni&s;hment of the Ingratitude of a wicked World; and <HI>partly</HI> in Favour to them&s;elves; for God takes them away from the Evil to come, they having, thro' Grace, done the Work a&s;&s;igned them, and being ripe for Heaven.</P>
<P>Again: Neither do I intend, that <HI>all</HI> &s;uch who live to <HI>Old-Age, are</HI> the <HI>Children of God</HI>: It is a <HI>&s;ad</HI> Truth, that &s;ome aged Per&s;ons are
<PB N="44" REF="004413_0028_100D502DD18751E8">
vain and wicked; the older they grow, the wor&s;e they grow; as they advance in Years, and draw nearer to the Grave, they become more ripe for De&s;truction.
<Q><HI>The Sinnner, tho' he live to be an hundred Years old, &s;hall be accur&s;ed</HI>; his living &s;o long, &s;hall be no Token to him of the divine Favour &amp; Ble&s;|&s;ing, nor &s;hall it be any Shelter to him from the divine Wrath and Cur&s;e; the Sentence he lies under will certainly be executed, and his long Life is but a long <HI>Reprieve</HI>: Nay, it is, it&s;elf, a Cur&s;e to him, for the longer he lives, the more Wrath he trea|&s;ures up again&s;t the Day of Wrath, and will have the more Sins to an&s;wer for.</Q></P>
<P>So that I don't intend, that the Children of God, and they only, &s;hall certainly live to a great Age in this World; but my mean|ing is, that Life &s;hall be enjoyed by them, <HI>&s;o long,</HI> and &s;o far as it &s;hall be for God's Glory, and their Good; and that's eno', and as much as any well di&s;po&s;ed Per&s;on would de&s;ire.

<P>But, you mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that I am &s;peaking, all this while, of the <HI>Grace</HI> of Contentment, as <HI>that</HI> which is <HI>enriching</HI>; for, there are &s;ome, who appear to be <HI>ea&s;y</HI> with their Con|dition, tho' it be but mean&punc; and yet are <HI>de&s;|titute</HI> of <HI>this Grace:</HI> Their Ea&s;ine&s;s proceeds from Incon&s;ideration, &amp; from a Spirit of Sloth and Carele&s;sne&s;s: They are a tho'tle&s;s Ge|neration; have not the Wi&s;dom of the <HI>Ant</HI>; but are rather like to the <HI>Hor&s;e</HI> and <HI>Mule,</HI> which have no Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>The Truth is, &s;uch as are <HI>properly content,</HI> are diligent in their Bu&s;ine&s;s, according to their Ability; and well &s;atisfied with the Portion which divine Providence curves out unto them: The&s;e Men do certainly eye the Hand of God in all Things; and if God

<P>Now certainly, &s;uch a Man has a truly <HI>excellent Spirit,</HI> who can accommodate him|&s;elf to every Condition of Life, and carry an equal Temper of Mind thro' all the Vici|&s;&s;itudes of his State, &s;aying, after the <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> Phil. 4 11, 12. <HI>I have learned, in what&s;oever State I am, therewith to be content</HI>; adding tho&s;e Words, in v. 13. <HI>I can do all Things thro' Chri&s;t, who &s;trengtheneth me.</HI>&mdash; And the Truth is, none may expect this <HI>Strength</HI> to be granted unto them, but tho&s;e <HI>who de|vote them&s;elves</HI> to the Service of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and profe&s;s to have their humble <HI>Dependance</HI> on him for <HI>Strength</HI> to <HI>enable</HI> them to perform their Duties in Sincerity, and to accept their Mercies thankfully, and to re&s;ign their Wills to his Will, under all the Circum&s;tances of Life.</P>
<P>And among the Servants of the Lord, none may, on better Ground, expect to have this Strength granted to them, than tho&s;e who do <HI>betimes engage</HI> in the <HI>Exerci&s;es</HI> of <HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Prai&s;e: God is good to I&s;rael, to tho&s;e that are of a clean Heart</HI>; but e&s;pecially to tho&s;e who <HI>early</HI> &s;eek his Face and Favour.

<P N="4">(4.)

<P>Now, certainly this ought to be look'd upon by <HI>you,</HI> as a very <HI>weighty</HI> Motive, to excite you to the Duties of Religion; For what in this Life can be &s;o de&s;ireable, as Grace and Growth therein? Surely nothing here below may be liken'd to it: <HI>All the Things

<P>And verily, this will not only be a Favour and Kindne&s;s unto <HI>others,</HI> for you to do them Service; but al&s;o it will be of Service to <HI>your&s;elves</HI>; for hereby you'l make <HI>Advan|ces</HI> Heavenward, and be laying up in <HI>Store</HI> again&s;t the Time to come, when none of your good Services &s;hall be forgotten, or

<P>And in a Word, HEAVEN will be <HI>your Portion</HI> if you <HI>now</HI> become the <HI>Lord's Chil|dren</HI> and <HI>Servants</HI>; and this will be infinitely better than any Portion which your <HI>earthly Parents</HI> can po&s;&s;ibly be&s;tow upon you.

<P N="1">1. Let the Things which follow be &s;eri|ou&s;ly con&s;idered, by Way of MOTIVE; <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>That <HI>your Children</HI> &s;tand in <HI>ab&s;olute need of Help</HI>; being born, not only de&s;titute of the <HI>true</HI> Knowledge of <HI>God,</HI> and of his Son <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and the <HI>Way</HI> to Life by him; but al&s;o, full of <HI>Enmity</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Lord,</HI> and again&s;t his <HI>Chri&s;t.&mdash;They need,</HI> I &s;ay, to be in&s;tructed in, and to be excited to, their Duty, being, by Nature, both, blind, and ob&s;tinate; wherefore, <HI>have Compa&s;&s;ion</HI> on <HI>them,</HI> and <HI>help them</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, the <HI>Word of God</HI> obligeth us, <HI>as we have Opportunity to do Good to all, and e&s;pecially to the Hou&s;hold of Faith</HI>; of which Hou&s;hold <HI>your Children</HI> are. &mdash; But then, be&s;ides this, <HI>Parents</HI> are <HI>expre&s;ly com+manded</HI> to <HI>train up their Children in the Way they ought to go; and to bring them up in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord</HI>;
