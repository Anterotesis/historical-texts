<BIBL>ST. JOHN, VIII. 36.</BIBL>
<Q>IF THE SON THEREFORE SHALL MAKE YOU FREE, YE SHALL BE FREE INDEED.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>LIBERTY is an ine&s;timable trea&s;ure; the delight and pa&s;&s;ion of mankind. It is the &s;ource of almo&s;t all human felicity; the parent of virtue, plea&s;ure, plenty and &s;e|curity: And the love of it is an appetite &s;o &s;trongly implanted in the nature and con&s;ti|tution of all living creatures, that even the principle of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, which is allow|ed to be the &s;tronge&s;t, &s;eems to be contained in it; &s;ince by means of Liberty, they enjoy the means of pre&s;erving them&s;elves, and of &s;atisfying their de&s;ires in the manner which they choo&s;e and like be&s;t. Hence many ani|mals can never be tamed, but feel the bit|terne&s;s
<PB N="4" REF="011141_0003_0F854A4A5B018B30">
of re&s;traint in the mid&s;t of the kinde&s;t u&s;age; and often grieve and &s;tarve them&s;elves to death.</P>
<P>By Liberty in general, I under&s;tand the Right every man has to pur&s;ue the natural, rea&s;onable and religious dictates of his own mind; to enjoy the fruits of his own labour, art and indu&s;try; to work for his own profit and plea&s;ure, and not for others, who live in idlene&s;s, and would riot in luxury, rapine and oppre&s;&s;ion. In &s;hort, liberty is to live upon one's own terms; and whenever this is lo&s;t or invaded, labour and indu&s;try will in|evitably langui&s;h; life grows precarious, al|ways mi&s;erable, and oftentimes intolerable. Slavery, on the other hand, is to live at the mere mercy and caprice of another; and a life of &s;lavery mu&s;t be a continual &s;tate of uncertainty and wretchedne&s;s; often an ap|prehen&s;ion of violence; often the lingering dread of a premature death; and hence in mo&s;t heroick &s;ouls, the love of liberty is &s;u|periour to the love of life.</P>
<P>How many have for&s;aken the tendere&s;t connections, and fled to the barbarous or &s;o|litary wilderne&s;s, to enjoy the ble&s;&s;ings of li|berty, and a good con&s;cience? How many have ru&s;hed into precipitate death, as a remedy for the lo&s;s of it? What convul&s;ions have &s;hook the world from nations &s;truggling under vio|lence
<PB N="5" REF="011141_0003_0F854A4A5B018B30">
and oppre&s;&s;ion? How many haughty tyrants have felt their vindictive rage? How many princes have brought &s;udden vengeance upon them&s;elves and po&s;terity by their unju&s;t u&s;urpations? Never was a nation &s;o degene|rate or regardle&s;s of their rights, as tamely to &s;uffer the lo&s;s of natural liberty and the exer|ci&s;e of unlimited power. People mu&s;t be de|ceived and frightened before they will be|come &s;laves. And thus, by the engines of vi|olence and delu&s;ion, have wicked and ambiti|ous men extingui&s;hed liberty in almo&s;t every country except Great-Britain and her Ame|rican colonies. And here too, by the &s;ame fatal means, it mu&s;t pre&s;ently expire, unle&s;s a &s;overeign remedy be &s;uddenly applied: The &s;ymptoms are many and dangerous, and its groans are continually ecchoing from &s;hore to &s;hore.</P>
<P>What have not Americans done to prevent this &s;ad cata&s;trophe? When parliamentary pre|rogative and mini&s;terial caprice fir&s;t began to extend their formidable arm and cru&s;h the tender plant of LIBERTY; how were its jealous SONS alarmed, and unanimous re|&s;olved to defend their favourite TREE? Fired with an unquenchable love for their country, and the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, they wrote with all the energy and enthu&s;ia&s;m of Greek or Roman orators. They painted li|berty in the mo&s;t attractive charms, adorned
<PB N="6" REF="011141_0004_0F854A4AEF8E6C58">
with the plea&s;ant fruits of peace, plenty, &s;cience, virtue and happine&s;s; and &s;lavery in its native horrour and deformity, black with ignorance, wickedne&s;s and mi&s;ery. They a&s;|&s;erted their inherent right to all the privileges of Engli&s;hmen; they gave &s;ufficient te&s;ti|monies of their loyalty and affection; they re|mon&s;trated with a zeal becoming patriots; and they <HI>petitioned</HI> with the dutiful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of humble dependants. And what is the e|vent? What is the re&s;ult of all the&s;e ani|mated endeavours? Why, in&s;tead of obtain|ing immediate redre&s;s, which they had rea&s;on to expect upon the principle of right, they were threatened by admini&s;tration; charged with <HI>unwarrantable combinations,,</HI> and with be|ing in a &s;tate of violence and oppo&s;ition to legal authority; their <HI>memorials</HI> were pa&s;&s;ed by in &s;ilence, and neglected, whil&s;t their mali|cious enemies were care&s;&s;ed and heard with applau&s;e.</P>
<P>As the la&s;t effort of a virtuous and op|pre&s;&s;ed people; they have lately framed and entered into <HI>Re&s;olutions</HI> of indu&s;try, frugality and oeconomy, hereby intending to defeat the Acts of the Briti&s;h legi&s;lature; to di&s;tre&s;s the merchants and manufacturers in England, and thus intere&s;t them in our favour. A mea&s;ure of this nature unanimou&s;ly adopted, and vi|gourou&s;ly pro&s;ecuted &s;eems the mo&s;t probable means left in their power for obtaining re|dre&s;s
<PB N="7" REF="011141_0004_0F854A4AEF8E6C58">
of grievances, and a re&s;titution of their invaluable rights and privileges. May di|vine providence &s;mile upon their attempts and grant the de&s;ired &s;ucce&s;s!</P>
<P>The nature and de&s;ign of the&s;e re&s;olutions you cannot be ignorant of. They are nece&s;|ary, practicable, and judiciou&s;ly calculated to promote the end in view. I doubt not, the generality of you have &s;igned them, evi|dencing at once a &s;incere affection for your country, and a genuine love of liberty. You have given demon&s;tration of your magnani|mity, and your abhorrence of oppre&s;&s;ion and arbitrary power. You dete&s;t the black thoughts of <HI>&s;lavery,</HI> or of betraying your rights by an indolent or timid behaviour. This encourages me humbly to propo&s;e to you, and I hope you will &s;hew an equal &s;pirit and alacrity in this ca&s;e, to enter into <HI>Re&s;olu|tions</HI> for &s;ecuring another kind of liberty; a LIBERTY as much excelling the former as the Soul is more excellent than the Body; a LIBERTY which &s;hall exalt you to the pri|vileges and immunities of the &s;ons of God; for in the emphatical language of our text, "If the &s;on &s;hall make you free, ye &s;hall be free indeed."</P>
<P>You confe&s;s that a future &s;tate is of infi|nitely greater importance than the pre&s;ent, and that temporal things cannot come into
<PB N="8" REF="011141_0005_0F854A4BC231C098">
competition with things eternal and everla&s;t|ing; you acknowledge that there will be a &s;olemn day of retribution, when the righteous and the wicked &s;hall be eternally rewarded and puni&s;hed, by him who is appointed the &s;overeign judge of quick and dead; you know from con&s;tant experience, that this is but a tran&s;ient and evane&s;cent &s;cene, and that the fa&s;hion of this world very &s;oon pa&s;&s;eth away. Can you therefore make earthly temporal things the &s;ole objects of your attention and pur&s;uit, and neglect the endle&s;s joys of hea|ven, and immortal glory? Can you be alarm|ed at every innovation and encroachment up|on your <HI>civil liberty,</HI> and at the &s;ame time &s;ink into &s;piritual and perpetual <HI>bondage</HI> to the wor&s;t of tyrants? Well might the earth wonder and the heavens be a&s;toni&s;hed at your folly. Surely if you know what it is to be rea&s;onable creatures, you will not he&s;itate a moment to enter into &s;teady, permanent and inviolable <HI>re&s;olutions</HI> for obtaining &s;uch a per|fect liberty, and becoming the free and hap|py &s;ubjects of the Prince of peace.</P>
<P>To a&s;&s;i&s;t you in this important matter, I &s;hall endeavour to explain to you the connec|tion and relative meaning of the text, "If the &s;on therefore &s;hall make you free, ye &s;hall be free indeed;" and then con&s;ider &s;ome of the e&s;&s;ential properties of that freedom which a|lone is perfective of your natures, and to
<PB N="9" REF="011141_0005_0F854A4BC231C098">
which I would urge you earne&s;tly to a&s;pire. And may God vouch&s;afe his almighty ble&s;|&s;ing, and grant us the glorious liberty of his children, "that we being delivered out of the hands of our enemies might &s;erve him without fear, in holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s before him all the days of our life." <HI>Luke</HI> i. 74, 75.</P>
<P N="1">I. We are to take a view of the connection and relative meaning of the text.</P>
<P>In this chapter we have an account of di|vers remarkable conferences our Saviour had with the unbelieving Jews, who daily &s;ought occa&s;ion again&s;t him, and made every thing he &s;aid a matter of controver&s;y and cavil. However he had a remnant, according to the election of grace, who believed on his name, and were his con&s;tant and faithful followers. In one of tho&s;e di&s;cour&s;es therefore, after having denounced death and final mi&s;ery a|gain&s;t the impenitent Jews, he addre&s;&s;es him|&s;elf to tho&s;e Chri&s;tians who believed on him, and tells them, "if you continue in my word, then are ye my di&s;ciples indeed." I exhort you to make it appear to the world that ye are my di&s;ciples, by a holy and ex|emplary conver&s;ation; by adhering imparti|ally to my word, and the faith of the Go&s;pel; and for your encouragement, ye &s;hall enjoy the privileges of all my &s;incere and humble
<PB N="10" REF="011141_0006_0F854A4C653FFED8">
followers, ye &s;hall know the truth, and the truth &s;hall make you free."</P>
<P>The Phari&s;ees, who were pre&s;ent at this Conference, thinking them&s;elves egregiou&s;ly affronted by the charter of liberty granted to believers, were much exa&s;perated at this &s;ay|ing, and with equal pride and indignation replied, "we be Abraham's &s;eed, and were never in bondage to any man, how &s;aye&s;t thou, ye &s;hall be made free?" We are of no &s;lavi&s;h extraction; our pedigree is noble and virtuous; we are de&s;cended from that il|lu&s;trious father of the faithful, who was in &s;pecial covenant with God; and by that means we are free-born, or at lea&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s privileges quite incompatible with a &s;tate of &s;lavery; yea, "we never were in bondage to any man;" therefore to talk of our being made free is perfect mockery and in&s;ult.</P>
<P>Je&s;us, who bore the contradiction of &s;in|ners again&s;t him&s;elf, did not chu&s;e to di&s;pute the truth of their in&s;inuations, though he might with a great <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> ju&s;tice and pro|priety. For how long did the &s;eed of Abra|ham groan under the heavy yoke of Egyptian bondage? How often were they brought in &s;ubjection to the neighbouring nations in the time of the Judges? They were &s;eventy years in a Babyloni&s;h captivity; and at this very juncture were lying under a national bondage
<PB N="11" REF="011141_0006_0F854A4C653FFED8">
being tributaries to the Romans, and impa|tiently looking for the Me&s;&s;iah, who, accord|ing to their crooked apprehen&s;ions, would be a great temporal monarch, and would re&s;tore the kingdom to I&s;rael. But if Chri&s;t had introduced a di&s;pute with the Jews, at pre&s;ent, concerning their civil liberty, it would have been intirely foreign to his &s;ubject; for he was &s;peaking before of a liberty where-with the truth &s;hould make them free, which mu&s;t undoubtedly be under&s;tood of a <HI>&s;piritual freedom.</HI> Therefore, without upbraiding them with their fallacy, he proceeded to ex|plain the doctrine more fully, and an&s;wered them, "verily, verily, I &s;ay unto you, who|&s;oever committeth &s;in is the &s;ervant of &s;in." He that maketh provi&s;ion for the fle&s;h to fulfil the lu&s;ts thereof; he that yieldeth his members in&s;truments of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s un|to &s;in; he that complies with all the &s;inful tendencies of corrupt nature, without any reluctance; is emphatically a <HI>&s;lave;</HI> he hath &s;old him&s;elf to work wickedne&s;s; and there|fore can have no pretence to liberty, whatever boa&s;t he may make of his parentage, or li|beral extraction.</P>
<P>This is a truth of univer&s;al concern. It is not limited to the Jewi&s;h nation, or to the Phari&s;ees of old, but is co-exten&s;ive with the whole human race, "that who&s;oever com|mitted &s;in is the &s;ervant of &s;in." He is in
<PB N="12" REF="011141_0007_0F854A4D326D2248">
captivity to the Prince of this world. Though he never were in bondage to any man, yet he is in bondage to his own corruption. "Know ye not, (faith the apo&s;tle) that to whom ye yield your&s;elves &s;ervants to obey, his &s;ervants ye are to whom ye obey, whe|ther of &s;in unto death, or of obedience unto righteou&s;ne&s;s?" <HI>Rom. vi. 16.</HI></P>
<P>Now that all men are naturally the &s;er|vants of &s;in is an undeniable propo&s;ition. All are naturally in the gall of bitterne&s;s, and the bonds of iniquity. Hence proceeds that in|difference about heaven and eternal things which characterizes the pre&s;ent age; that a|ver&s;ion to the plea&s;ures of holine&s;s and be|nevolence which univer&s;ally prevails; and that deluge of iniquity which has over&s;pread the world with &s;uch an uncontrouled predo|minance. This, my brethren, is your own con|dition. Though you enjoy all the external rights of freemen and Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, which is a doubtful ca&s;e at pre&s;ent, yet you are na|turally in &s;piritual bondage; &s;laves to cor|ruption; and to be in&s;en&s;ible of it is a more &s;hocking &s;ymptom of degeneracy, and that every heroick and generous principle is ex|tingui&s;hed in your minds.</P>
<P>Would you now a&s;pire after liberty and happine&s;s? Would you e&s;cape from a wretch|ed captivity unto &s;in? Would you become
<PB N="13" REF="011141_0007_0F854A4D326D2248">
free citizens of the new Jeru&s;alem? Then you mu&s;t determine to enter into &s;teady, per|manent and &s;acred <HI>re&s;olutions</HI> to oppose the motions of &s;in in your members, and to live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and godly in the world. You mu&s;t offer up humble and fervent <HI>peti|tions</HI> to the throne of grace for relief. The Maje&s;ty of Heaven will not be deaf to your complaints; "behold the Lord's hand is not &s;hortened, that he cannot &s;ave; neither his ear heavy that it cannot hear." But your <HI>pe|titions</HI> mu&s;t be pre&s;ented through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is the way, the truth and the life. He is the believers <HI>agent</HI> in the cele&s;tial court. He is able to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t, all that will come unto God through him. And then "if the &s;on &s;hall make you free; ye &s;hall be free indeed."</P>
<P>I have now explained the connections and relative meaning of the text; I proceed there|fore,</P>
<P N="2">II. To con&s;ider &s;ome of the e&s;&s;ential pro|perties of that freedom which alone is per|fective of your natures, and to which I would urge you earne&s;tly to a&s;pire.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is a liberty that frees all believers from the guilt of &s;in and the condemning &s;entence of the law. The law required per|fect and univer&s;al obedience in heart and life
<PB N="14" REF="011141_0008_0F854A4E01EEE368">
under pain of a mo&s;t tremendous cur&s;e; "cur&s;ed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them." It prohibited the minute&s;t failure, and admitted of no repent|ance. The &s;malle&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion rendered the &s;oul obnoxious to death and endle&s;s tor|ment. God's immaculate holine&s;s obliged him to annex threatenings of the mo&s;t ex|qui&s;ite mi&s;ery to the breach of his law; and his unchangeable veracity makes him exe|cute them; el&s;e few would reverence his au|thority, and his government would be ex|po&s;ed to perpetual in&s;ult and violation.</P>
<P>Now all men, being by nature the children of wrath and di&s;obedience, lie expo&s;ed to the penalty of a broken law. We are tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ours from the womb; "and there is none righteous, no not one." Every per&s;on that reflects upon his own moral conduct, and compares it with the extent and purity of the divine commandment, will find ju&s;t cau&s;e to lament with the prophet I&s;aiah, "Woe is me, for I am a man of unclean lips." And woe unutterable &s;hall be the certain portion of all unbelievers, who live and die under the en|&s;laving power of &s;in; "they &s;hall be ca&s;t in|to outer darkne&s;s, where there is weeping and gna&s;hing of teeth." But believers in Chri&s;t are already freed from the condem|ning &s;entence of the law, and delivered from
<PB N="15" REF="011141_0008_0F854A4E01EEE368">
the guilt of &s;in whereby, they were bound over to the awful terrours of death and a fu|ture judgment. "Chri&s;t hath redeemed them from the cur&s;e of the law, being made a curse for them; therefore being ju&s;tified by faith, they have pardon and peace with God."</P>
<P>Believers indeed are not freed from a con|&s;cientious regard to the duties of the moral law. They are freed from it as a covenant for ju&s;tification, but not as a rule for their direction and practice. This is the mea&s;ure of their conduct both in private and in &s;ocial life. Hence the precepts of the law are &s;till urged under the go&s;pel, to enforce the duties of the Chri&s;tian religion. But yet it is certain, "that there is no condemnation to them that are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who walk not after the fle&s;h, but after the &s;pirit." He hath blotted out the hand writing of ordinances, which threatened their eternal ruin; he hath canceled the obligation to puni&s;hment, and having &s;poiled principalities all powers, he made a &s;hew of them openly, triumphing over them. O GLORIOUS LIBERTY OF BELIEVERS! "Who &s;hall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that ju&s;ti&s;ieth: Who is he that condemneth? It is Chri&s;t that died, yea rather that is ri&s;en again, who is even at the right hand of God, who al&s;o maketh interce&s;&s;ion for us. <HI>Romans</HI> viii. 33. 34.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="16" REF="011141_0009_0F854A4EB05784D0">
2. Another e&s;&s;ential property of this li|berty of the go&s;pel is, that it frees all be|lievers from the reigning power and domi|nion of &s;in; what an abject and intolerable <HI>&s;lavery</HI> is the &s;ervice of divers lu&s;ts? How &s;ad and deplorable is their condition, who follow the dictates of a hard heart and a de|praved con&s;cience. Subjection to the mo&s;t de&s;potick prince on earth cannot exceed it. On the contrary, how &s;ecure and happy is the e&s;tate of tho&s;e who are renewed and &s;anc|tified by the operations of the ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirit! Their bondage is at an end. and their obe|dience is <HI>perfect freedom.</HI> "For the law of the &s;pirit of life which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us hath made them free from the law of &s;in and death." <HI>Romans</HI> viii. 2.</P>
<P>'Tis true, perfection is not attainable in this life. None enjoy an ab&s;olute freedom from corruption; the be&s;t of Chri&s;tians feel and lament the workings of indwelling &s;in; they find a law in their members warring a|gain&s;t the law of their mind, and bringing them into captivity. Corruptions, like the Canaanites, are &s;till left in the land, to be thorns in our eyes, and goads in our &s;ides. Often too they prevail again&s;t the believer, and bring him into captivity and &s;piritual bondage; &s;o that he cries out with the apo&s;tle
<PB N="17" REF="011141_0009_0F854A4EB05784D0">
"O wretched man that I am, who &s;hall de|liver me from the body of this death!"</P>
<P>But it is al&s;o true, that &s;in &s;hall not have perpetual dominion over them, "for they are not under the law, but under grace." Their evil affections are crucified with Chri&s;t, and the body of &s;in dieth in them daily; they are gradually gaining a more compleat victo|ry over their corruptions; and advancing by degrees to that region of perfect freedom and never-ending felicity which is beyond the grave.</P>
<P N="3">3. Believers by the liberty of the go&s;pel are delivered from the controul and authori|ty of Satan. I mean not that they are freed from the a&s;&s;aults and temptations of our ma|lignant adver&s;ary. The devil and his infer|nal mini&s;ters, under who&s;e admini&s;tration they were by nature, are continually <HI>impo&s;ing taxes</HI> and exacting a <HI>revenue</HI> from the children of God, and exerting every malicious &s;cheme to bring them into their former &s;tate of &s;er|vitude and &s;ubjection. Hence we are &s;aid to wre&s;tle not only with fle&s;h and blood, but with principalities and powers; with the rulers of the darkne&s;s of this world; with &s;piritual wickedne&s;s in high places. Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour him&s;elf conflicted with the vi|olent temptations of Satan; and Job, He|man
<PB N="18" REF="011141_0010_0F854A4F86194F50">
and David, have left on record, doleful complaints on this account.</P>
<P>But as Chri&s;t foiled the devil in every a&s;|&s;ault and led captivity captive; "&s;o believers are made more than conquerours by the pow|er of his might." Being purcha&s;ed not with corruptible things as &s;ilver and gold, but with the precious blood of the Redeemer, they pay him the voluntary tribute of gratitude and prai&s;e for his infinite conde&s;cen&s;ion and un|merited ble&s;&s;ings; and bear their &s;tronge&s;t te&s;timony again&s;t paying any <HI>duties</HI> to that evil &s;pirit which ruleth in the children of di&s;obedience.</P>
<P N="4">4. Believers, by the liberty of the go&s;pel are delivered from the &s;lavi&s;h fears and ter|rours of death. The Chri&s;tian is &s;ubject to the &s;ame calamities of life, and to the &s;ame laws of mortality with the infidel world; but not to the &s;ame dire and gloomy appre|hen&s;ions of futurity. When the &s;inner ap|proaches near the borders of the invi&s;ible world, and yields to grave and &s;erious re|flections, then he knows and feels him&s;elf to be, what he actually is, a wretch, a &s;elf-ac|cu&s;ed, &s;elf condemned criminal, pre&s;aging in his con&s;cience, that witne&s;s within him, his condemnation at a higher tribunal. But a &s;incere Chri&s;tian's rea&s;on and con&s;cience are his friends and advocates. His rejoicing is
<PB N="19" REF="011141_0010_0F854A4F86194F50">
the te&s;timony of a good con&s;cience, that in &s;implicity and godly &s;incerity, he has had his conver&s;ation in the world. Hence he hath confidence towards God; and when the time of his di&s;&s;olution comes, he can &s;ay in triumph, "O death, where is thy &s;ting? O grave, where is thy victory? Thanks be to God, who giveth me thy victory, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t." I <HI>. Cor.</HI> xv. 55, 57.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the liberty derived from the truth of the go&s;pel, is glorious, and its privileges exten&s;ive; it frees us from the yoke of the ceremonial law, and from the more grievous burdens of the tradition of the elders; it frees us from fal&s;e prejudices and mi&s;takes; from the dominion of lu&s;t and pa&s;&s;ion; and re&s;tores the &s;oul to a reli|gious &s;elf-government, and to the rational life of a Chri&s;tian; it enlarges the mind with &s;piritual knowlege; elevates it above the objects of time and &s;en&s;e; and makes it an heir of glory and immortality; it brings e|very thought unto the obedience of Chri&s;t; nor does the &s;oul ever act with greater liberty than when it acts under a divine command. The enemies of Chri&s;tianity pretend to free-thinking, whereas tho&s;e are the free&s;t rea&s;on|ings that are guided by faith; tho&s;e are the men of free&s;t thought, who&s;e thoughts are captivated and brought unto obedience to Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="011141_0011_0F854A504E48D470">
You have now heard explained, though in a very cur&s;ory and imperfect manner, the e&s;&s;ential nature of that freedom, which Chri&s;t, the eternal Son, grants to all tho&s;e who em|brace the truth of his go&s;pel, and continue &s;tedfa&s;tly in his word. You have al&s;o heard, that the whole world lieth in wickedne&s;s, by nature expo&s;ed to the cur&s;e of a broken law, and in mi&s;erable captivity to the prince of this world. A little candid reflection, and &s;elf-examination will convince you that this is the ca&s;e. Ari&s;e then, my brethren, and la&s;h up your re&s;entment; view the LI|BERTY, the tran&s;porting LIBERTY of the SONS OF GOD! View the fulne&s;s of joy and immortal plea&s;ures that are before you! The&s;e &s;hall attend as rewards of your &s;ucce&s;s. Ignominy, di&s;grace, &s;lavery and endle&s;s tor|ment &s;hould enflame you more than all the harangues in the world.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider the wiles and &s;tratagems of your common enemy. "He is continually going about &s;eeking whom he may devour." He is &s;triving to deprive you of your heavenly inheritance, and to involve you in common mi&s;ery and de&s;truction. Now when your friend or neighbour injures you in your tem|poral pur&s;uits, or defrauds you of &s;ome ex|pected good, your revenge immediately ri&s;es! When admini&s;tration makes an illegal attack
<PB N="21" REF="011141_0011_0F854A504E48D470">
upon your civil liberty, your re&s;entment is pre&s;ently rou&s;ed, and every means exerted to fru&s;trate their de&s;igns! Surely it becomes you much more to be jealous of your &s;pi|ritual liberty; to oppo&s;e the avowed enemy of God and man, and endeavour to di&s;ap|point his wicked machinations.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider at what prodigious expence this freedom was procured; when thou&s;ands of rams, and ten thou&s;and rivers of oil were in|&s;ufficient to purcha&s;e it, the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us "gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for us." He who was the brightne&s;s of his father's glory, and the expre&s;s image of the invi&s;ible God, di&s;|robed him&s;elf of his magnificence; a&s;&s;umed the humble garment of poverty and con|tempt; and &s;uffered the rude in&s;ults of a wicked world, and even the agonies of death it&s;elf, for our redemption Can you there|fore neglect a trea&s;ure of &s;uch immen&s;e va|lue? Can you forget your almighty bene|factour and advocate, whil&s;t you honour and applaud every common <HI>patriot</HI> that has di|&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the cau&s;e of your coun|try? Then every noble principle is eradicated out of your minds, and you are capable of venturing upon any form of ingratitude and ba&s;ene&s;s.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider your own eternal felicity is at &s;take; this you cannot be altogether indif|ferent
<PB N="22" REF="011141_0012_0F854A510AA66CD8">
about; it is of more importance to you than kingdoms and empires; "For what is a man profited if he gain the whole world, and lo&s;e his &s;oul?" This con&s;ideration &s;hould awaken every one to vigourous endea|vous after that grace and &s;anctification, which alone can relea&s;e him from the bondage of corruption, and con&s;titute him an heir of a ble&s;&s;ed immortality. You mutually run in|to mea&s;ures of <HI>oeconomy, frugality</HI> and <HI>indu&s;try,</HI> in order to defeat the acts of parliament, and promote a general repeal; much more &s;hould you adopt another kind of <HI>oeconomy</HI> and <HI>indu&s;try,</HI> as ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in order to defeat the empire of &s;in in your &s;ouls, and to promote your own &s;alvation.</P>
<P>LASTLY, Con&s;ider the welfare and happi|ne&s;s of &s;ucceeding generations. A regard for po&s;terity is a con&s;iderable argument in the pre&s;ent conte&s;t for liberty. You want to tran&s;mit inviolate to the late&s;t po&s;terity the rights and privileges of that happy con&s;titu|tion you have derived from your ance&s;tours: an hone&s;t and laudable ambition! But &s;ure|ly a favour of religion and chri&s;tian liberty is equally worthy to be tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity. You cannot convey them a better inheritance. God vi&s;its the iniquities of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth gene|ration of them that hate him; but &s;hews mer|cy
<PB N="23" REF="011141_0012_0F854A510AA66CD8">
unto thou&s;ands of them that love him and keep his commandments.</P>
<P>From the&s;e and the like con&s;iderations, which are highly proper and rational, I hope you will not delay to enter into holy and in|violable re&s;olutions, for obtaining this glori|ous and exalted freedom, which &s;hall make you happy amid&s;t all the &s;torms and tempe&s;ts of this mortal &s;cene, and heirs of a kingdom that &s;hall never end, where you &s;hall &s;ing hallelujahs and &s;ongs of &s;alvation to Him that &s;itteth upon the throne, and to the Lamb that was &s;lain, for ever and ever. AMEN.</P>
