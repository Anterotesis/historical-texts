<P>I JOSEPH MOUNTAIN, was born on the 7th day of July, A. D. 1758, in the hou&s;e of Samuel Mifflin, <ABBR>E&s;q.</ABBR> of Philadelphia, father of the pre&s;ent Governor of Penn&s;ylvania. My father, Fling Mountain, is a Molat|to, and now lives at Philadelphia. My mother is a Negro and was a &s;lave till &s;he was twenty-one years of age.&mdash;She now lives at Reading, in Penn&s;ylvania.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;eventeen years of my life were &s;pent in Mr. Mifflin's family.&mdash;As a &s;ervant in the hou&s;e I acquired the reputation of unu&s;ual &s;prightine&s;s and activity. My ma&s;ter was indu&s;trious to in&s;truct me in the Pre&s;byterian religion which he profe&s;&s;ed, teach me to read and write, and impre&s;s my mind with &s;entiments of virtue. How gro&s;sly the&s;e opportunities <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> been neglected, the fol|lowing &s;tory will too <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ce.</P>
<P>In the 17th year of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ge, on the 17th of March 1775, with my ma&s;ter's con&s;ent, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tered on board the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ip Chalkley, commanded by Jo&s;eph Spain, and owned by Me&s;&s;i'rs James and Drinker of Philadelphia, and on the 20th of May following we arrived in the Downs. I &s;oon quitted the ve&s;&s;el, and in four days was &s;trolling the &s;treets of London in que&s;t of amu&s;ements. In this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">|ation, the public will ea&s;ily conceive, I could not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> remain an idle &s;pectator. It will not be &s;urprizing to find me &s;peedily initiated in practices di&s;graceful to hu|man nature, and de&s;tructive of every moral virtue. Un|fortunately for me, a &s;cene began to open which will clo&s;e only in the &s;hadow of death.</P>
<P>One day, at an ale-hou&s;e in London, I accidentally became acquainted with one Francis Hyde, originally from Middle&s;ex, and one Thomas Wil&s;on, of Stafford|&s;hire in England. They were travelling the country, with a hand organ and various other mu&s;ical in&s;truments, pretending to great art in numerous performance, and

really po&s;&s;e&s;ing &s;urprizing knowledge in every &s;pecies of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ggling. This was their employment in the day time, for the purpo&s;e of executing more effectually the princi|pal bu&s;ine&s;&s; of their lives, viz.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reader will note, that when we u&s;e the term <HI>foot-pad,</HI> we mean <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> on foot only; <HI>highway-man</HI> intends one who robs on hor&s;e back.</NOTE> highway robbery. They <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> found me &s;u&s;ceptible of almo&s;t any impre&s;&s;ions, and neither incapable of, nor aver&s;e to, becoming a compani|on in their iniquity. We all &s;at but from London about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> o'clock in the evening after I had joined them, each armed with a hanger and a Brace of pi&s;tols. We had al&s;o &s;uitable dre&s;&s;es and a dark lanthorn. Our landlord, who kept tavern at the &s;ign of the black hor&s;e, at Char|ing-cro&s;s, furni&s;hed us with every requi&s;ite for the expe|dition. His name was William Humphrys. The p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n this evening was to attack the mail-coach, which would &s;tart at 12 o'clock at night, from the &s;hip tavern, between Woolwich and Graves-end, about 9 miles from London.</P>
<P>We were on the &s;pot at the hour agreed upon, and di&s;gui&s;ed our&s;elves for the adventure. Hyde and Wil|&s;on were dre&s;&s;ed in white <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and boots, with their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aces painted yellow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Molattoes. Mountain was dre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame manner, with the addition of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> tail wig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, white gloves and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> black ma&s;k over his face. When the &s;tate arrived, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">ed, and caught the leading hor&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> bridles, while Hyde and Wil&s;on each pre&s;ented a brace of pi&s;tols in at the coach window, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> demanded of the pa&s;&s;engers their money. There were four gentlemen and one lady in the coach. They denied having any money. Wil&s;on &s;aid, "Deliver, or death." They then gave us a bank note of 50I. one o|ther of 20l. and about 60 guineas in ca&s;h. We <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> re|tired to an unfrequented place, &s;hifted our dre&s;&s;es, and prepared to pro&s;ecute our journey to Chatham in the county of Kent.</P>
<P>In the day time, Hyde and Wil&s;on commonly played upon their in&s;truments, and performed various &s;eats of &s;light of hand, as tho' that was their &s;ole occupation. We were al&s;o very particular in making ob&s;ervations upon

all travellers, to learn if they might be <HI>touched</HI>; (for that was our word for <HI>robbed.</HI>)</P>
<P>In four days after the former robbery, we met a Capt. Hill at the foot of Roche&s;ter bridge near Chatham&mdash;He was a captain of the marines, and we had &s;een him in the day time at Brumpton barracks, about half a mile from the bridge. We walked directly before his hor&s;e. Wil&s;on a&s;ked him the time of night. He made no reply. Hyde then caught the bridle. I, his left hand, and Wil|&s;on pre&s;ented a pi&s;tol to his brea&s;t, and &s;aid, "Deliver, or death." He a&s;&s;ured us that he had no money worth taking. Wil&s;on &s;aid, "then give us your watch," which he did. The watch was gold, and valued at 50 guineas. We then walked off about 300 rods towards Graves-end, immediately tacked for Roche&s;ter, where we lodged at the mariner's inn. There was a great <HI>hue and cry</HI> for us; but the pur&s;uers, &s;uppo&s;ing from Capt. Hill's in|formation, we had gone for Graves-end, entirely mi&s;|took our rout. The next morning we took po&s;t-chai&s;e for London, where we arrived about 6 o'clock in the evening <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Char b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">dy was delivered to a broker whom we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> employed. He was a Jew, and lived in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. Katherine's Row, near Town Hill, and his name was William Mo&s;es. There were al&s;o other brokers in different parts of England, with whom we had con&s;tant communication, and who were perfectly acquainted with our modes of acquiring property. After &s;uch a jaunt we thought it advi&s;eable to recruit our&s;elves by rioting on our &s;poils.</P>
<P>In a few days, it was concluded that I &s;hould go alone, and attempt to "touch" &s;ome gentlemen who frequented the plays at Covent Garden; this, con&s;idering my age and inexperience, was thought rather a bold &s;troke. Be|ing villain enough to attempt any thing, I did not he&s;i|tate; but po&s;ted my&s;elf agreeably to direction. My ef|forts, however, were wholly un&s;ucce&s;ful, and I returned empty. The next night I was placed at London bridge, while Hyde &s;tood at Black-fryars, and Wil&s;on at We&s;t|mini&s;ter.
<PB N="5" REF="022441_0005_0FB8766D8A75AC60">
At half pa&s;t 11 o'clock I met a Captain Duffield, and a&s;ked him the time of night. He told me. I &s;aid, "You know my profe&s;&s;ion; deliver or death." He &s;tepped back to &s;trike me with his cane; I cocked my pi&s;tol, and told him to deliver in&s;tantly, or death <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ld be his portion. He then threw me his pur&s;e, which contained about 10 guineas, and a &s;ilver watch, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ch was valued by our broker at 6I. Hyde, the &s;ame <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, obtained about 40 guineas of Sir John Griffing. Wil&s;on about 30 of a Mr. Burke; and each a watch, one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, the other pinchbeck. The next day we &s;aw ad|verti&s;ements, de&s;cribing the robberies, and offering re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> for the perpetrators.</P>
<P>The next night, with little difficulty, I robbed Hugh <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">&s;ly of 16 guineas, and a gold ring. Hyde, on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> evening, took from Lord John Cavendi&s;h about 20 guineas, and Wil&s;on robbed William Burke of 11 guineas.</P>
<P>We now concluded to remain in London for a while, <HI>gentlemen of plea&s;ure.</HI>&mdash;The repeated robberies had fur|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed us with ca&s;h in abundance, and we indulged in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y &s;pecies of debauchery. We gambled very deeply <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, card&s; and billiards. Hyde and Wil&s;on were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> expert at this bu&s;ine&s;s, and would almo&s;t invariably <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">dle a &s;tranger out his money.</P>
<P>In March 1776, we went to the city of York, about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> miles from London. Here we continued &s;everal weeks, waiting &s;ome favourable opportunities to rob at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> plays; but none pre&s;ented. We went from York <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> New-Market, to attend the famous races which took place about the fir&s;t of June. There we found Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of Richmond, and Lord Tufton of Sheffield in York&s;hire: We were much perplexed to invent the mo&s;t advantageous made of "touching" them. It was at length concluded to attack them at their lodgings, which were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> an inn very large and greatly frequented by various <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">es of people. About 7 o'clock in the evening, while <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> attendants of tho&s;e gentlemen were in the kitchens <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;tables, we entered the front door, and having brib|ed
<PB N="6" REF="022441_0006_0FB87670F9D81718">
the porter with a few guineas, were immediately let into the room. Lords Gore and Tufton were &s;itting o|ver a table at a di&s;h of coffee, and reading news-papers. We in&s;tantly pre&s;ented our pi&s;tols, and demanded their money, Lord Tufton delivered us one bank note of 100l. and three others of 50l. each. Lord Gore deliver|ed us about 100 guineas, and two gold mourning rings. We quitted New-Market next morning, and went in the &s;tage to York, where Wil&s;on pre&s;ented his bills for pay|ment. Unfortunately for us, Lord Tufton, immediate|ly after the robbery, di&s;patched his &s;ervant to the bank, with orders to &s;top tho&s;e bills, if offered. The bills were accordingly &s;topped, and Wil&s;on arre&s;ted, and &s;ent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> New-Market to be examined before a ju&s;tice of the peace. Upon his examination he procured Hyde to &s;wear that he was riding from New-Market to York with Wil&s;on and that he &s;aw him pick up a pocket book containing tho&s;e bills. The coachman, having been previously bribed, &s;wore to the &s;ame fact. Upon this te&s;timony Wil&s;on was acquitted. I was not &s;ent for as a witne&s;s at this examination, as I under&s;tood Lord Robert M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ers was then in New-Market and would probably <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|tend the trial. The rea&s;on why I did not wi&s;h to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> his Lord&s;hip's eye, was, that on the night before we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> London, I made a mo&s;t daring attack upon him. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> was walking unarmed, near Houn&s;low Heath, att<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters"> by his foot-man. I met him, pre&s;ented my pi&s;tol, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> he gave me 75 guineas, two gold watches, and two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> rings.&mdash;Hyde and Wil&s;on were near at hand; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> did not di&s;cover them&s;elves, leaving me "to play the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> alone."</P>
<P>In the latter end of June we again met at the old <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">+dezvous in London and divided our plunder. The pro|perty which I then had on hand enabled me to live <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> freely for &s;ome months. My time was &s;pent in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> round of di&s;&s;ipation which was the nece&s;&s;ary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> upon &s;o vicious a character, and which was tolerabl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;upported by the &s;tock of ca&s;h in my own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that of my broker.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="022441_0007_0FB876720867C778">It now re&s;olved to quit this cour&s;e of life which I had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">rto pur&s;ued with &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s. Accordingly I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ed on board the brig Sally, as Cook, and made two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">es in her to Li&s;bon. Upon my return, after ex|pecting my pay, I made another voyage, in the Fanny, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t.

Our fir&s;t object was to a&s;&s;ail the Newca&s;tle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e, which would be in Tottenham-Court road at 8 o'|clock in the evening.

men, who had a&s;&s;aulted Lord Garnick about 15 minutes before our engagement, one of whom was badly wounded. The next day we &s;aw an adverti&s;ement offering a reward of 60 guineas for the detection of the robbers, and in|forming, that it was &s;uppo&s;ed three were killed. This &s;pecimen of the enterprize of my new a&s;&s;ociates convinc|ed me, that they were not adepts in their <HI>occupation,</HI> and induced me to quit their &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s which now &s;eemed mo&s;t alluring to me, was that of <HI>highway-men.</HI> Con&s;idering my&s;elf at the head of foot-pads, I a&s;pired for a more <HI>honorable</HI> employment and therefore determined to join my&s;elf to the gang of highway men, who&s;e rendezvous were at Broad St. Giles's, up Holborne, at the &s;ign of the Hamp&s;hire hog, and kept by a William Harri&s;on, a native of the I&s;le of Man, Harri&s;on was the &s;upport, the protector and the landlord of this whole company. The hor&s;es and accoutrements were kept and furni&s;hed by him, and occa&s;ionally &s;uppli|ed to adventurers. He enquired my name, and finding that I was Mountain who was con&s;ederate with Hyde and Wil&s;on, he readily admitted me to the fraternity. He a&s;ked if I dared take a jaunt alone; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> willing for any thing, he quickly furni&s;hed me with e|quipments proper for the expedition. Mounted on a very fleet hor&s;e, and prepared with proper changes of dre&s;s, I &s;at out for Coventry, about 90 miles from Lon|don. I made great di&s;patch in travelling, and about 10 o'clock the night after my departure, I met Richard Watts coming out of a lane about two miles from Co|ventry. I rode up to him, and enquired if he was not afraid of highway-men? He replied, "No, I have no property of value about me." I then told him that I was a man of the profe&s;&s;ion, and that he mu&s;t deliver or abide the con&s;equences. Upon this he gave me his gold watch: I in&s;i&s;ted on his money, and cocked my pi&s;tol, threatening him with in&s;tant death. He perceived that re&s;i&s;tance and per&s;ua&s;ion were equally unavailing, and threw me his pur&s;e containing 13 half guineas and some

I then ordered him back down the lane, accom|plished him thither, and &s;led with the greate&s;t ha&s;te into adjacent wood: Here I &s;hifted my own and hor&s;e's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, leaving them in a bye place, rode directly to a neigh|boring town, and there put up for the night. Thence I took my cour&s;e for Newca&s;tle in Devon&s;hire, about 276 miles north of London, and thence to Warrington in Lan|ster&s;hire. Here about 7 o'clock in the evening I met with a gentleman who appeared an object of plunder. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed him the time of night; he drew his watch, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> me the hour. I ob&s;erved "You have a very fine watch." He an&s;wered, "Fine enough." "Sir, 'tis too is for you&mdash;you know my profe&s;&s;ion&mdash;deliver."

On <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> night of the &s;econd day I robbed Thomas Reevs of guineas, and a gold watch worth about 30l. &s;terling. To in&s;ult him in his di&s;tre&s;s, after committing the fact, I pulled off my hat, made a low bow, wi&s;hed him good night, and &s;at out for Lanca&s;ter in company with the &s;age. It occurred to me, that riding as a guard to the &s;age would &s;ecure me again&s;t &s;u&s;picion. Accordingly I accompanied it to Lanca&s;ter, and there put up at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">wan and two necks." Here I continued three days, waiting a favourable opportunity to exerci&s;e my profe&s;&s;i|on. On the third evening at 8 o'clock, I &s;topped a Col.

Pritchard, took from him a gold watch valued at 44 guineas, a pur&s;e of 30 guineas, 3 gold rings, and a pair of gold knee-buckles worth about 6l. The knee-buckles appeared &s;o tempting, I told Pritchard, I could not avoid taking them. At 11 o'clock I left Lanca&s;ter, and hav|ing rode about one mile from town, I &s;topped, pulled off my hat, and bid them "good-bye."</P>
<P>My cour&s;e was now for Manche&s;ter, where I put up for about 24 hours at the "bull's-head." The evening following, about 11 miles from Manche&s;ter, I "touched" a Quaker. It was nearly 9 o'clock when I met him. I enquired if he was not afraid to ride alone. He an&s;wer|ed, No. I a&s;ked him his religion; he replied "I am a Friend." I ob&s;erved, "You are the very man I was looking for&mdash;you mu&s;t deliver your money." He &s;eem|ed very unwilling, and &s;aid, "Thou art very hard with me." I replied, "You mu&s;t not <HI>thou</HI> me." He then gave me his plain gold watch, 6 guineas, and four bank notes of 20l. each. I then pre&s;ented a prayer-book, and demanded an oath that he would make no di&s;covery in 8 hours: He refu&s;ed an oath, alledging that it was con|trary to his religion, but gave his word that my request &s;hould be complied with. I then di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him, return|ing the bank notes, and took a circuitous rout for Lon|don. The guineas which I had obtained in this jaunt, I concealed and carried in the &s;oles of my boots, which were calculated for that purpo&s;e, and effetually an&s;wer|ed it. The mare which I rode was trained for the bu&s;i|ne&s;s: &s;he would put her head in at a coach window with the utmo&s;t ea&s;e, and &s;tand like a &s;tock again&s;t any thing. She would travel al&s;o with &s;urprizing &s;peed. Upon my arrival at Harri&s;on's, (having been gone eleven days) I gave a faithful narrative of my tran&s;actions, and produced the plunder as undeniable proof. I never &s;hall forget with what joy I was received. The hou&s;e rang with the prai&s;es of Mountain. An elegant &s;upper was provided, and he placed at the head of the table. Notwith&s;tand|ing the darkne&s;s of his complexion, he was complimented

<P>Fatigued with &s;uch a jaunt, and fearing left too fre|quent adventures might expo&s;e me, I determined on tarrying a while at home. My hor&s;e was given to another, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d he directed to &s;eek for prey. After one month's ab|&s;ence he returned with only 16 guineas, and was treated accordingly by the gang. He was inadequate to the bu&s;ine&s;&s;, and was therefore ordered to tarry at home, ju&s;t to vi&s;it the play-hou&s;es, &amp; <HI>&s;harp it</HI> among people who might ea&s;ily be chou&s;ed of their property. Each took his tour of duty in cour&s;e; &s;ome &s;ucceeded; others, from misfor|tune or want of &s;pirit, were di&s;graced. One young fel|low of the party was about this time detected at Guilford <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">urry, tried, condemned and executed. He made no discovery, tho' we all trembled. A plan was now in a|gitation to di&s;patch two or three of the gang to Port&s;|mouth, to attack &s;ome of the navy officers: It was finally adopted, and one Billy Coats, a Londoner, and Mountain are &s;elected as the mo&s;t &s;uitable for the expedition. We <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nted our hor&s;es on the next morning, and reached Port&s;mouth that day, a di&s;tance of more than 70 miles. We took lodgings at an inn kept by a rich old mi&s;er. We were &s;oon convinced that he had ca&s;h in plenty, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t it "was our <HI>duty</HI> to get it;" but the difficulty was that plan &s;hould be concerted.

practi&s;ing every &s;pecies of impo&s;ition which ingenuity could invent, or the mo&s;t depraved heart execute.</P>
<P>In the beginning of June 1780, I joined the mob head|ed by Lord George Gordon. This mob was the re&s;ult of a di&s;pute between the Papi&s;ts and Prote&s;tants. It was a matter of the mo&s;t &s;overeign indifference to me whether the rebellion was ju&s;t or unju&s;t: I eagerly joined the &s;port, I rejoicing that an opportunity pre&s;ented whereby I might obtain con&s;iderable plunder in the general confu&s;ion.&mdash;Lord Gordon repre&s;ented to us in a &s;peech of &s;ome length, the open attempts upon the Prote&s;tant religion, and the manner in which the petitions of the injured had been treated by parliament. He exhorted us all to follow him to the hou&s;e of commons, and protect him while he &s;hould pre&s;ent, with his own hand, the parchment roll, contain|ing the names of tho&s;e who had &s;igned the petition, to the amount of about 120,000 prote&s;tants. His &s;peech was an&s;wered with loud huzzas, and repeated a&s;&s;urances of our zeal to &s;upport him and his cau&s;e. The whole body of us, in number about 50,000, left St. George's fields, and marched directly for the parliament hou&s;e: We were in four &s;eparate divi&s;ions. A mo&s;t tremendous &s;hout was heard from all quarters, upon our arrival before both hou&s;es. Lord Gordon moved that he might intro|duce the petition; but the hou&s;e would not con&s;ent that it &s;hould be then taken up. The mob became greatly inflamed: they in&s;ulted &s;everal members of the hou&s;e of lords, who narrowly e&s;caped with their lives. Several gentlemen of parliament reprobated the conduct of Lord George in the &s;evere&s;t terms; and Col. Gordon, a rela|tion of his Lord&s;hip, threatened him with in&s;tant death the moment any of the rioters &s;hould enter the hou&s;e. At length, when the que&s;tion was put in the hou&s;e of commons, in defiance of the menaces of the mob, only &s;ix out of two hundred voted for the petition. The ri|oters now di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves into various parts of the city, de&s;troying and burning the chapels of Roman Ca|tholics and their hou&s;es. The five &s;ucceeding days were
<PB N="13" REF="022441_0013_0FB8767EC9684788">
employed in demoli&s;hing the hou&s;es of Sir George Saville, in burning Newgate, and relieving about 300 per&s;ons confined in it, (&s;ome under &s;entence of death) in &s;etting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ire to King's bench and Fleet-pri&s;ons, and in innume|rable other acts of violence and outrage towards tho&s;e who were in the oppo&s;ition. The bank was twice a&s;&s;ail|ed but was too well guarded for our attempts. On the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th day we were over-powered by &s;uperior force, and obliged to di&s;per&s;e. During this confu&s;ion, I provided for myself, by plundering, at various times, about 500l. &s;terling.</P>
<P>After leading <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;uch di&s;&s;ipation for five or &s;ix <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, an incident occurred which cau&s;ed me, for &s;ome time, to abandon my former pur&s;uit, and &s;ettle down in tolerable regularity. I became acquainted with a Mi&s;s Nancy Allingame, a white girl of about 18 years of age. She was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of about 500l. in per&s;onal property and a hou&s;e at I&s;lington.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reader will plea&s;e to recollect, that Negroes are con&s;idered in a different point of light in England, from what they are in America: The blacks have far <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> connection with the whites, owing to the idea which prevails in that coun|try, that there are no &s;laves.</NOTE> It may appear &s;ingular to ma|ny, that a woman of this de&s;cription &s;hould be in the lea&s;t intere&s;ted in my favor; yet &s;uch was the fact, that &s;he not only endured my &s;ociety, but actually married me in about &s;ix months after our fir&s;t acquintance. Her other and friends remon&s;trated again&s;t this connexion; but &s;he quitted them all, and united her&s;elf to me. My whole re&s;idence with her was about three years; during which time I exhau&s;ted all the property which came into my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by the marriage. We then &s;eparated, and &s;he was received by her father.</P>
<P>In June 1782 a, having joined Hyde and Wil&s;on, we determined to quit England, and &s;ee if the French gen|tlemen could bear "touching." We accordingly cro&s;&s;ed Dover, and at Dunkirk about 7 o'clock in the even|ing robbed a gentleman of about 200 French crowns. We then proceeded to Paris by the way of Bre&s;t. On the &s;econd evening after our arrival in this city, we robbed Count Dillon, on his return from the plays, of a gold
<PB N="14" REF="022441_0014_0FB876822B151938">
watch and 12 French guineas. The next day, about I o'clock in the afternoon, we attacked Governor Du Boyer, at his country &s;eat about four miles from Paris, and took from him about 200l. in bank bills. Hyde and Wil|&s;on performed this, while I lay about 250 yards di&s;tant.</P>
<P>Di&s;patch ia travelling, after &s;uch bold adventures, be|came very nece&s;&s;ary. We immediately quitted Paris, and rode all night for Havre-de-Grace, where we ar|rived the evening of the next day. Here we found an adverti&s;ement, which prevented our changing the notes, and induced us to burn them.</P>
<P>Bayonne was the next object of our pur&s;uit. At this place Hyde robbed two gentlemen in one night; Wil&s;on one, and Mountain one&mdash;the whole of that evening's plunder amounted to about 500l, &s;terling. France now became dangerous, and therefore we pu&s;hed with all po&s;-&s;ible expedition for Spain, and arrived at Madrid, the capital, in a few days. The regulations of this city were &s;uch, that we were obliged to quit the object of our pur&s;uit. The city was &s;trongly walled in, and mo&s;t &s;curpu|lou&s;ly guarded. The gates were &s;hut every evening at 8 o'clock, and every man compelled to be in his own habitation. After &s;pending &s;everal months in rioting on our booty, we went to Gibraltar. We bribed the Spani&s;h centinel, and entered the Briti&s;h lines. We ap|peared before the Engli&s;h commander, General Elliott, and informed him we were Engli&s;hmen, and mechanics by profe&s;&s;ion. The fleet commanded by Lord Howe, arrived there on the fourth day after us. Gen. Elliott con&s;ented that we &s;hould enter on board the fleet as &s;ea|men. Accordingly I joined my&s;elf to the Magnificent of 74 guns, commanded by Capt. John Elver&s;ton; Hyde entered the Victory, Lord Howe; and Wil&s;on a 74 gun &s;hip, who&s;e name I do not recollect. This was in the fall of the year 1782. I never &s;aw Hyde and Wil&s;on again till &s;ince the peace took place between England and the United States. I tarried on board the Magnifi|cent about three months, during which time we had an
<PB N="15" REF="022441_0015_0FB8768348E0B480">
engagement with the French and Spani&s;h fleets. We drove them out of the Straits, &s;unk their junk &s;hips with hot &s;hot, and captured the St. Michael, a Spani&s;h &s;hip of 74 guns. The Magnificent &s;ailed with the fleet for Spithead, where, direcly after my arrival, I made my e&s;cape from her by bribing the centinel with 5 guineas, &amp; &s;wimming three quarters of a mile to the I&s;le of Wight. From this place I went to London by the way of Ply|mouth. The landlord at the old place of re&s;ort receiv|ed me very cordially.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of robbing again &s;olicited by attention, and in the fall of the year 1783, as I was walking in Wap|ping, in que&s;t of plunder, I accidentally fell in company with my old companions, Hyde and Wil&s;on. They had remained in the &s;ea &s;ervice ever &s;ince we left Gibraltar. We concluded it advi&s;eable to join our&s;elves to the gang at Harri&s;on's, and re&s;ume our occupations. Holland now appeared an object worth attention. In November 1783, we went to O&s;tend, and thence to Am&s;terdam, On the road thro' Holland, we knocked an old Dutch|man down, and took from him 1100 guilders. The next day about 4 o'clock in the morning, Hyde attacked a merchant, and obtained about 100 guilders; and the e|vening following, we robbed four gentlemen of about 150l. &s;terling, and three &s;ilver watches of &s;mall value, we continued living very freely at Am&s;terdam 4 weeks, without effecting any thing: during which period we were preparing to a&s;&s;ail a bank. At length, by the help of various in&s;truments, we entered it about I o'clock at night. We found an iron che&s;t which we could not open. We brought away two bags of gold, containing about 1100l. &s;terling. We buried them about 2 miles di&s;tant, and &s;uffered them to remain there two months. The noi&s;e, relative to the robbery having by this time &s;ub&s;ided, we took our money, entered on board a ve&s;&s;el bound for England, and were &s;afely back in London in the &s;pring of the year 1784. To inve&s;t our ca&s;h, &amp;c. in real property, and quit a cour&s;e of life attended with &s;o
<PB N="16" REF="022441_0016_0FB876870921B138">
much fatigue and hazard, was thought the mo&s;t eligible plan. In pur&s;uance of this idea, Hyde bought him an hou&s;e and lot about 4 miles from London. My &s;hare was joined with Hyde's. Wil&s;on purcha&s;ed him a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|ation at Cherry-garden-&s;tairs. Each kept an hou&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the reception of gamblers, &s;windlers and foot-pads.</P>
<P>The rioters who were concerned in Lord Gordon's rebellion were now daily arre&s;ted, tried and executed. Knowing my&s;elf deeply concerned in this mob, and &s;up|po&s;ing it probable that Mountain's turn might come next. I quitted London, went on board an European ve&s;&s;el, and made a voyage to Grenada. From this pe|riod till Augu&s;t 1789, I was employed as a &s;ailor; dur|ing which time I made two voyages to the Coa&s;t of Gui|nea, and brought cargoes of Negroes to Jamaica; one voyage to Greenland; one to Leghorn and Venice; three to Philadelphia, and one to St. Kitts. Upon my re|turn from voyages, I frequently went from Liverpool to London, and put up at Hyde's or Wil&s;on's. In Octo|ber 1786, we committed a burglary upon the hou&s;e of Ge|neral Arnold, who then re&s;ided in London. We cater|ed his hou&s;e about 2 o'clock at night, with a dark <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|horn, and, from a bureau in the room where the General and lady were a&s;leep, we &s;tole about 150l. &s;terling in ca&s;h, and a pair of &s;tone &s;hoe buckles.</P>
<P>In the month of Augu&s;t 1789, I left New-York in the Briton, with a cargo of bread and flour owned by Mr. John Murray, jun. of New-York, and went to Bil|boa in Spain. The ve&s;&s;el proved leaky, and was &s;old. Being di&s;charged, I entered on board the brig Aunt, commanded by Capt. Thomas Mo&s;eley, and owned by William Gray, of Bo&s;ton, failed from Bilboa the 7th day of March, and arrived in Bo&s;ton the 2d of May la&s;t. On the 14th of the &s;ame month I quitted Bo&s;ton on foot for New-York. On my journey, at East-Hartford, I &s;tole five dollars from the cabin of a &s;loop lying in Con|necticut river. I was immediately apprehended, carried before George Pitkin; Esq. and adjusted to be whipped

her cries had brought to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;ome neigh|bouring people, I &s;till continued my barbarity, by in&s;ulting her in her di&s;tre&s;s, boa&s;ting of the fact, and glorying in my iniquity. Upon reflection, I am often &s;urprized that I did not attempt my e&s;|cape; opportunity to effect it frequently pre&s;ented before I was apprehended. Yet, by &s;ome unac|countable fatality, I loitered unconcerned, as tho' my conduct would bear the &s;tricte&s;t &s;crutiny. The coun&s;el of heaven determined that &s;uch a prodi|gy in vice &s;hould no longer infe&s;t &s;ociety. At four o'clock I was brought before Mr. Ju&s;tice Daggett for examination. The te&s;timony was &s;o pointed, that I was ordered into immediate confinement, to await the approaching &s;e&s;&s;ion of the Superior Court.</P>
<P>On the 5th of Augu&s;t la&s;t, I was arraigned be|fore the Bar of the Superior Court. My trial was far more favourable than I expected. There was every indulgence granted me which I could have wi&s;hed; and the court, jurors and &s;pectators ap|peared very differently from tho&s;e I have &s;een at Old-Bailey. The jury had little he&s;itation; indeed the mo&s;t compa&s;&s;ionate hearer of this cau&s;e could have only pronounced me <HI>Guilty.</HI> I beheld with a&s;toni&s;hment the lenity of the Court, and am &s;ure that in a country where &s;uch a &s;acred regard is had to the liberty of the &s;ubject, no man's life can be unju&s;tly taken from him. On the Tue&s;day follow|ing, the Chief Ju&s;tice pronounced Sentence of Death again&s;t me. I thought my&s;elf le&s;s moved with this pathetic addre&s;s than either of the court, or any &s;pectator; and yet, I confe&s;s, I was more affected by it, than by any thing which had previou&s;ly hap|pened in my life. On the next Sabbath I attended

meeting. The addre&s;s of the Rev. Dr. Dana on that day and the &s;ub&s;equent advice and admonitions which I have received from the Clergy of this and other places, were calculated to awaken every feeling of my heart. Much gratitude is due from me to tho&s;e gentlemen who have exhibited &s;uch a tender con|cern for my immortal intere&s;t.</P>
<P>It now remains that I <HI>die</HI> a death ju&s;tly merited by my crimes. "The cries of injured innocence have entered the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth, and called for vengeance."
