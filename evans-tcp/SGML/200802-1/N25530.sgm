<HEAD>Introductory remarks.</HEAD>
<P>THE year 1798 &s;eemed to have been marked by Providence as pregnant with uncommon fatality to the people of the United States. Philadelphia, New-York, Bo&s;ton, Port&s;mouth, and &s;everal places of inferior note, were doomed to &s;ee their &s;treets depopu|lated, and their inhabitants cut off by a mercile&s;s pe&s;ti|lence. The dreadful <HI>Yellow Fever,</HI> which had lately made &s;uch lamentable ravages in &s;ome of our capital towns, appeared this year with increa&s;ed violence.&mdash; New-London, though heretofore remarkable for the &s;alubrity of its air, had neverthele&s;s its portion in the bitter cup.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the immediate cau&s;es of this melan|choly vi&s;itation, the opinions of the philo&s;opher, the phy&s;ician, and the divine, are at variance. By &s;ome it was attributed to infection imported from abroad; by others to dome&s;tic origin from putrid animal &s;ub|&s;tances; by others to the exce&s;&s;ive and continued heat of the weather; and by &s;ome to the judgment of hea|ven in puni&s;hment of national iniquities. The inha|bitants of the United States, it is true, had been for &s;ome time looking for a diminution of their numbers: but it was a diminution by other means which they expected. Preparations for ho&s;tilities were actively going forward, the din of arms re&s;ounded in all our ports, and the noi&s;e of war was heard in every corner of the land. But, like David, we were de&s;tined to "fall into the hands of God rather than man." The bu&s;tle of politics &s;uddenly died away, the noi&s;e and
<PB N="iv" REF="033890_0004_0ffa5520191f4258">pomp of military parade cea&s;ed; and in their &s;tead a general &s;tillne&s;s and di&s;may prevailed, bu&s;ine&s;s and cares of every kind but that of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation were neg|lected, and the public prints were either &s;u&s;pended or filled with the records of di&s;ea&s;e and death.</P>
<P>Thus in the &s;pace of one month was the face of A|merican affairs entirely changed. How were the migh|ty fallen! how were the hopes of the great de&s;troyed!</P>

<HEAD>A &s;hort Account, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 26th of Augu&s;t the inhabitants of New-London were &s;omewhat alarmed by the death of capt. Elijah Bingham, keeper of the Union Coffee-Hou&s;e, after an illne&s;s of but two or three days. His funeral was immediately attended, it being Sunday, by the Union Lodge of Free Ma&s;ons, of which he was a member, and an unu&s;ual number of people whom the &s;olemnity of the ceremony and e&s;teem for the decea&s;ed drew together. It was, however, remarked at the time, that if the extreme hot weather continued it would be long before the burying-ground would be &s;o thronged again: and the remark was too fully verified. Two days after three per&s;ons in the neighborhood di|ed of the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e, which was &s;oon a&s;certained to be the dreadful <HI>Yellow Fever,</HI> The citizens now per|ceived their danger and removed from the infected part, the corporation and civil authority left their po&s;ts, and a <HI>Health Committee,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of Me&s;&s;ieurs John Woodward, John Ingraham, James Baxter, and Ebe|nezer Holt, jun. were appointed to attend to the buri|al of the dead, the care of the &s;ick, and the relief of the indigent. The &s;ickne&s;s rapidly increa&s;ing, the next week witne&s;&s;ed no le&s;s than twenty-five deaths, among whom were &s;ome of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable characters be|longing to the city or &s;tate, and the wife, a &s;on and a daughter of the late capt. Bingham, in the vicinity of who&s;e hou&s;e the contagion was yet principally confined. This very great mortality among &s;o &s;mall a number of people filled the citizens with con&s;ternation; the dead were interred with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed, and without the
<PB N="6" REF="033890_0006_0ffa553849b2dd48">lea&s;t formality, the hear&s;e being commonly attended only by the &s;exton and two or three black a&s;&s;i&s;tants, one of whom died of the prevailing di&s;ea&s;e. Laying out the corp&s;e, ornamenting the coffin and covering it with a pall, &amp;c. were generally di&s;pen&s;ed with, every con&s;ideration giving way to the important duty of con|&s;ulting the &s;afety and convenience of the &s;urvivors.&mdash; The country people naturally &s;hunned the pe&s;tilential air of the devoted city, and the adjoining towns took mea&s;ures for preventing our flying inhabitants from &s;preading the infection.</P>
<P>From this period the progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e was varied according to the favourable or unfavourable changes in the air, the effects of which were vi&s;ibly perceived on the per&s;ons of the &s;ick and the number of new ca&s;es which occurred. That portion of the city where it fir&s;t appeared being almo&s;t entirely aban|doned, it gradually extended into mo&s;t of the compact parts within the di&s;tance of an hundred rods; but de|crea&s;ed in the violence of its &s;ymptoms and frequency of its attacks as the &s;ea&s;on advanced, and by the 14th of October it had &s;o far abated that the citizens began to return to their dwellings and re&s;ume their u&s;ual oc|cupations.</P>
<P>The mortality within the afore&s;aid limits, (viz. an hundred rods north and &s;outh from the market) was equal to that among the &s;ame number of inhabitants in any part of Philadelphia in the &s;ame length of time. In Bank-&s;treet, below the market, to the &s;outh corner of Goldenhill-&s;treet, of tho&s;e who did not remove from the &s;pot, but two per&s;ons over 12 years of age e&s;caped the infection. In this &s;pace, excluding the buildings which were evacuated and the people who fled, are 15 hou&s;es, &s;hops and &s;tores, in which lived or were em|ployed 92 per&s;ons, of whom 90 had the fever, 33 di|ed, and 2 e&s;caped entirely. The deaths above the market were not in &s;o great a proportion.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="033890_0007_0ffa554e386f1908">By October 28th the fever had nearly di&s;appeared, after having, in about eight weeks, cut off 81 per&s;ons, a li&s;t of who&s;e names are hereafter &s;ubjoined.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Phy&s;icians.</HEAD>
<P>AS during the ravages of this terrible di&s;order me|dical a&s;&s;i&s;tance was the greate&s;t concern of the people, it may not be improper to mention their ac|commodation in that re&s;pect. Early in the &s;ickne&s;s all the phy&s;icians, but one who was too much indi&s;|po&s;ed to practi&s;e, and another, Dr. Raw&s;on, who was violently attacked by the fever, de&s;erted the city, ex|cepting Dr. SAMUEL H. P. LEE, to who&s;e lot it fell alone and una&s;&s;i&s;ted to combat the fury of this dread|ful pe&s;tilence. And his conduct on the occa&s;ion was &s;uch as will call the warme&s;t &s;entiment of gratitude and e&s;teem from the citizens of New-London as long as the remembrance of the <HI>Yellow Fever</HI> &s;hall exi&s;t in their minds. He cheerfully &s;u&s;tained the arduous ta&s;k of vi&s;iting and &s;upplying with medicine from 30 to 50 patients daily, notwith&s;tanding the great fatigue and danger of infection to which he peculiarly expo&s;ed him&s;elf. How many owe their &s;afety to his &s;kill and a&s;&s;iduity it is impo&s;&s;ible to know; but in all probabi|lity there are many now enjoying the invaluable ble&s;|&s;ings of life and health who but for his benevolent care would have been tenants of the hou&s;e of re&s;t. In the di&s;charge of the important duty to which he &s;o nobly devoted him&s;elf he was &s;eized with the prevailing di&s;|order, but after a &s;truggle of a few days was happily pre&s;erved from falling a &s;acrifice to his humanity. On his confinement Dr. James Lee, with a zeal and phi|lanthropy that does him the highe&s;t honour, left his re&s;idence and bu&s;ine&s;s in the remote parts of the town and repaired to the city, where he ably &s;upplied the
<PB N="8" REF="033890_0008_0ffa5554c70d34d0">place of his kin&s;man till there was no more occa&s;ion for his &s;ervices. The <HI>Committee,</HI> al&s;o, had written to &s;ome of the neighbouring phy&s;icians, reque&s;ting their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but none came to our relief, &s;aving Dr. A|mos Collins, from We&s;terly, who could not remain an unmoved &s;pectator of our di&s;tre&s;s. Mr. Gurdon J. Miller, likewi&s;e, a gentleman of much profe&s;&s;ional abi|lity, induced by the &s;ufferings of his fellow-citizens, commenced practice in a line he had never de&s;igned to have been found in, and al&s;o refu&s;ed any compen&s;ation for his unwearied and meritorious exertions. <HI>Such con|duct needs no prai&s;e or comment: its reward is found in the heart.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e were our pilots through the fearful &s;torm.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Poor.</HEAD>
<P>THE di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the labouring poor in this unex|pected calamity were unavoidably great. De|prived of their ordinary means of &s;upport, and unable to remove where employment and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence might be had, they were expo&s;ed to the evils of poverty and danger of &s;ickne&s;s united. To alleviate the&s;e a great part of the attention of the Committee was directed. But their utmo&s;t vigilance would have been of little avail, without the charitable a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the adjoining towns and our own wealthy citizens. By their good|ne&s;s they were enabled to afford to the nece&s;&s;itous a con&s;iderable degree of comfort and &s;ecurity. Dona|tions of money, produce, &amp;c. (a catalogue of which are annexed) were daily received and di&s;tributed ac|cording to the urgency of circum&s;tances; the courthou&s;e, being in an elevated and healthy &s;ituation, was converted into an ho&s;pital; and medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance and nur&s;es were provided for tho&s;e who fell under the care of the Committee, while others in a &s;uperior &s;ituation
<PB N="9" REF="033890_0009_0ffa556626d6cb78">might have peri&s;hed for the want of them. In fact, &s;uch was the difficulty of procuring nur&s;es and watch|ers, that &s;ome of our mo&s;t opulent citizens were &s;een going from hou&s;e to hou&s;e with money in their hands, offering any price for a&s;&s;i&s;tance even for a &s;ingle night in vain. This reluctance to attend the &s;ick was occa|&s;ioned by &s;everal having lo&s;t their lives by infection taken while employed in that office. Notwith&s;tand|ing this di&s;couraging circum&s;tance, many were found who&s;e humanity would not &s;uffer them to withhold the lea&s;t kind office in their power in a time of &s;uch unex|ampled di&s;tre&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Health Committee.</HEAD>
<P>THE Health Committee being appointed on the &s;pur of this melancholy occa&s;ion, and the civil authority devolving principally upon them, &s;ome ac|count of their proceedings will be given. They had power to do whatever in their judgment the exigencies of the ca&s;e &s;hould require. They accordingly, being &s;en&s;ible of the helple&s;s &s;ituation to which the poor mu&s;t be reduced by the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of all bu&s;ine&s;s, and the di&s;tre&s;s they mu&s;t &s;uffer when attacked by &s;ickne&s;s, made them the chief object of their care. Vigilant and per&s;evering at all &s;ea&s;ons in the execution of their new functions, they &s;ought out proper &s;ubjects of their attention wherever they could be found, admini&s;tering to them the nece&s;&s;aries and comforts of life, keeping a watchful eye over their health, and providing the mo&s;t prompt and effectual a&s;&s;i&s;tance whenever they were &s;eized by the di&s;ea&s;e. Exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ed as they were to the greate&s;t ri&s;que, a &s;en&s;e of danger never induced them for a moment to &s;hrink from their &s;tricte&s;t duty; and although three of the four of them were brought in a manner to the brink of the grave by the raging pe&s;ti|lence,
<PB N="10" REF="033890_0010_0ffa55762ba88b50">yet was the fatiguing bu&s;ine&s;s of their employ|ment performed with cheerful alacrity to the la&s;t. It was their province to feed the hungry, vi&s;it the &s;ick, and inter the dead; a ta&s;k, many parts of which were de|licate, embarra&s;&s;ing and di&s;agreeable in the highe&s;t de|gree. Yet with an impartial hand and firm undeviat|ing &s;tep did they proceed till the expiration of their office. The &s;ervices they rendered to the city in this trying &s;ea&s;on were great, and will long be gratefully remembered. Their names, as mentioned before, are JOHN WOODWARD, JOHN INGRAHAM, JAMES BAX|TER, and EBENEZER HOLT, jun.</P>

<HEAD>Of the cau&s;e of the Fever.</HEAD>
<P>WHATEVER might have been the different o|pinions re&s;pecting the cau&s;e of this di&s;ea&s;e, the data from which a conclu&s;ion on the &s;ubject mu&s;t be drawn are extremely few and obvious. The idea of imported infection, having neither fact or argument to &s;upport it, mu&s;t of cour&s;e be abandoned. From do|me&s;tic cau&s;es, then, are we to account for its origin. And here might be mentioned a number of different articles in the neighborhood where the di&s;ea&s;e com|menced, to which many attributed its origin. But as the opinions on this &s;ubject are extremely various and contradictory, and as it belongs properly to the pro|vince of the faculty, it is therefore left for their deter|mination. It &s;hould, however, be remarked, that the weather for &s;ome weeks previous to the appearance of the fever was uncommonly dry and warm, as every one ob&s;erved. Light breezes and calms had long prevailed, no rain had fallen for two months, vegetation was parched, wells were dried, and the crops within a few miles di&s;tance were about half cut off. The mercury in Fahrenheit's thermometer frequently &s;tood in the
<PB N="11" REF="033890_0011_0ffa558591e36ff0">&s;hade at 96 degrees, and &s;everal times at 98, a height never before witne&s;&s;ed here; and &s;ea-captains com|plained that they never felt &s;o much inconvenience from the warmth in the We&s;t-Indies. In this &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere, when animal and vegetable &s;ub&s;tances are &s;o liable to become putrid and engender a poi&s;on|ous air, &s;omething might ea&s;ily be found to kindle the fatal &s;park of contagion into a blaze. And it is there|fore thought evident, even to a demon&s;tration, that we owe this vi&s;it of this de&s;tructive pe&s;tilence neither to fo|reign, extraordinary or hidden cau&s;es, but to dome&s;tic origin from the &s;ole action of <HI>heat,</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the dry|ne&s;s and calmne&s;s of the atmo&s;phere.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Hi&s;tory of the di&s;ea&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>IT may not be improper to remark, that almo&s;t eve|ry per&s;on who remained in the central parts of the city, particularly tho&s;e contiguous to Bank-&s;treet, or who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s called them there, although otherwi&s;e in perfect health, laboured under a high &s;tate of <HI>pre|di&s;po&s;ition,</HI> being con&s;tantly affected with a &s;light and tran&s;ient head-ache, a white furred tongue, and &s;mall &s;hooting pains through the &s;y&s;tem. And tho&s;e who came near this &s;pot from other parts of the town very &s;en&s;ibly felt a difference in the &s;tate of the air produc|ing in a greater or le&s;s degree &s;ome of the&s;e &s;ymptoms. This was undoubtedly owing to the atmo&s;phere being impregnated with noxious <HI>mia&s;mata</HI> or the <HI>&s;eeds of con|tagion,</HI> which only required an exciting cau&s;e, &s;uch as violent exerci&s;e, exce&s;&s;ive fear, expo&s;ure to cold or damp air, &amp;c. to kindle the flame.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e generally announced its attack by a &s;en&s;e of chilline&s;s or common ague-fit, attended with a pain in the head, and &s;ometimes in the back and limbs. In the more dangerous ca&s;es the chilline&s;s was not always
<PB N="12" REF="033890_0012_0ffa559f38f77f00">perceived. The attack was u&s;ually preceded by lan|guor and re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, and a &s;trange and unde&s;cribable feeling through the whole &s;y&s;tem. On its commence|ment, the patient was frequently &s;eized with nau&s;ea and vomiting, ob&s;tinate co&s;tivene&s;s, and &s;orene&s;s of the whole body. The co&s;tivene&s;s in &s;ome few ca&s;es could not be removed by the mo&s;t powerful purgatives; ca|lomel and jalap, &s;alts, oil, and injections, were repeat|ed without effect; and the pa&s;&s;age from the &s;tomach to the bowels &s;eemed entirely clo&s;ed until death. From this cau&s;e might proceed the load and pre&s;&s;ure in the &s;tomach, &s;ometimes higher and &s;ometimes lower, which, with very few exceptions, always attended the di&s;ea&s;e, and frequently continued &s;ome days after the patient was apparently recovered.</P>
<P>During the fir&s;t &s;tage the progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e was commonly marked with gentle flu&s;hings in the face, al|ternating with a pale, &s;hrunk, de&s;ponding and yellow countenance&mdash;the eyes were red, and their ve&s;&s;els ap|peared to be &s;woln with blood&mdash;&s;ome were almo&s;t to|tally blind, and others could not bear the lea&s;t degree of light&mdash;but the&s;e &s;ymptoms, with the pain in the head, generally &s;ub&s;ided after bleeding and other evacuations. The &s;orene&s;s of the mu&s;cles, the di&s;tre&s;s at the &s;tomach, and pain in the head and back, corre&s;ponding with the extreme pains mentioned by writers on the fever of the We&s;t-Indies many years ago, called the "Break-bone Fever," continued&mdash;with the &s;kin dry and parched, the tongue covered with a dark brown &s;curf, frequently &s;caling off and leaving the tongue red and &s;ometimes &s;ore&mdash;the fur was &s;ometimes very white, and &s;ometimes &s;carcely vi&s;ible. Delirium, ravings, and great involun|tary &s;trength frequently appeared about this period, le&s;s violent in &s;ome than others, though equally dangerous. But &s;ome perfectly retained their &s;en&s;es, and complain|ed of little pain, remaining in a &s;tupid calm and indif|ference&mdash;upon being a&s;ked how they were, they always
<PB N="13" REF="033890_0013_0ffa55bad9350c78">an&s;wered "very well"&mdash;their eyes were &s;omewhat &s;unk, though red and inflamed, their cheeks purple and red|di&s;h, their extremities cold, their &s;kin dry, and the u&s;u|al nau&s;ea and oppre&s;&s;ion at the &s;tomach. The pul&s;es of the &s;ick were variable; &s;ometimes high, quick and &s;trong, and at others low, quick, and very ten&s;e, like a &s;tretched cord; and always ro&s;e upon bleeding.</P>
<P>This account principally de&s;cribes the &s;ymptoms on the fir&s;t or &s;econd day. If the di&s;ea&s;e was not by this time taken in hand by the phy&s;ician, it was for the mo&s;t part too late to be of any ultimate benefit. The patient now began to bring up matter from his &s;tomach of the color and con&s;i&s;tence of coffee-grounds, and &s;ome|times blood&mdash;blood i&s;&s;ued from the mouth, no&s;e, and eyes&mdash;the fever raged without any intermi&s;&s;ion&mdash;re&s;pi|ration became quick and laborious&mdash;the &s;kin and whites of the eyes became more yellow&mdash;&s;ometimes he al&s;o &s;unk into a comato&s;e or &s;leepy &s;tate, from which he could hardly be rou&s;ed by any means, and then but for an in|&s;tant&mdash;the eyes a&s;&s;umed a gla&s;&s;y appearance&mdash;the coun|tenance exhibited a cadaverous hue, and a certain &s;ymp|tom of death which is better under&s;tood than de&s;cribed &mdash;with the black vomit, black and fetid &s;tools came on &mdash;and the patient, often lo&s;ing his &s;en&s;es, and often re|taining them to the la&s;t, on the fourth or fifth day falls a prey to this mo&s;t de&s;tructive malady.</P>
<P>In a few in&s;tances glandular &s;wellings, or buboes, that deadly &s;ymptom in the Mediterranean plague, made their appearance. In one they were driven back into the &s;y&s;tem by &s;trong mercurial applications, and the di&s;ea&s;e terminated favorably; in a &s;econd ca&s;e the patient al&s;o recovered; but in a third the i&s;&s;ue proved fatal.</P>
<P>In the latter &s;tages of the di&s;ea&s;e a &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of urine was commonly a &s;ymptom of great danger, but did not always indicate death, as &s;everal recovered after an en|tire
<PB N="14" REF="033890_0014_0ffa55d7d84ed6e0">&s;toppage of the urinary pa&s;&s;ages for one, two or three days.</P>
<P>Some in their la&s;t moments in&s;en&s;ibly &s;prang from their beds, and required three or four to hold them; others would &s;cream like a calf dragging to the but|cher's block; while many at this period gave directions concerning their affairs, bid their attendants adieu, and &s;urrendered to their fate with the utmo&s;t calmne&s;s and re&s;ignation.</P>
<P>If the patient &s;urvived the fifth or &s;ixth day, he was generally out of danger; or if the phy&s;ician, by large quantities of mercury applied internally and externally, could produce a <HI>&s;alivation,</HI> it was a favorable circum|&s;tance, and never failed to prove &s;ucce&s;sful. When the di&s;ea&s;e terminated fortunately they &s;oon recovered, but were extremely liable to a relap&s;e, from too much exerci&s;e, taking cold, or u&s;ing improper diet, in which ca&s;e they &s;carcely ever conquered the &s;econd a&s;&s;ault; and by this means &s;ome of our mo&s;t valuable citizens lo&s;t their lives.</P>
<P>In &s;ome the di&s;ea&s;e &s;truck inwardly, and without any violent external &s;ymptoms gradually undermined the con&s;titution, and carried off the patient in eight or ten days.</P>
<P>On per&s;ons of an intemperate habit the &s;eeds of con|tagion operated like &s;parks of fire upon tinder, and in &s;pite of every effort of medicine raged with irre&s;i&s;tible violence till the vitals were con&s;umed, generally termi|nating its progre&s;s upon the fifth day.</P>
<P>In many, however, a &s;weat and vomit, with bleed|ing and purging, removed the &s;ymptoms in a few hours; and in very few in&s;tances where medicine had a free action did the di&s;order prove fatal.</P>
<P>THE cour&s;e of medicine which generally proved &s;ucce&s;sful was&mdash;judicious bleeding, &s;weating, purging off the bilious redundancy of acrimonious matter in the
<PB N="15" REF="033890_0015_0ffa55ec739c91f8">&s;tomach, bowels, &amp;c. and &s;alivation by mercury as &s;oon as could po&s;&s;ibly be procured. Bli&s;tering, warm baths, and injections, were admini&s;tered with much advan|tage.</P>
<P>It is the opinion of Dr. S. H. P. Lee, who&s;e oppor|tunity, at lea&s;t, of becoming a judge in the ca&s;e, will not be di&s;puted, that this di&s;ea&s;e is as ea&s;ily managed, if taken at its commencement, as any di&s;order to which the human &s;y&s;tem is &s;ubject, and that the extraordinary mortality incident to &s;uch pe&s;tilential vi&s;itations is owing in a great mea&s;ure to an unhappy idea that the di&s;ea&s;e, from a &s;pecific quality of the contagion, is in it&s;elf fatal to all without di&s;tinction whom it attacks.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;e of one per&s;on in this fever was perhaps worth mentioning. He lived a few miles from the city, but was in town upon a wharf a few rods from the place where the contagion fir&s;t made its appearance, and was exerci&s;ing him&s;elf &s;omewhat violently, after &s;un&s;et, and in a con&s;iderable per&s;piration. In this &s;ituation he was &s;uddenly &s;truck by a nau&s;eous and uncommon &s;mell, occa&s;ioning a &s;icki&s;hne&s;s at the &s;tomach. He mention|ed this to his companion, and proceeded home, conti|nuing to perceive the &s;mell until he was &s;ome miles on his way. On going to &s;upper he found his appetite much impaired, but did not think it de&s;erved remark|ing, and took no more notice of the matter. In about fifty-two hours, however, without having been in the city &s;ince, he was awakened from his &s;leep by a fit of &s;hivering and pain in the head, with a &s;trong recurrence of the nau&s;eous &s;mell inhaled on the wharf. This &s;cent was removed by a vomit; and the pain gradually left its fir&s;t &s;eat and concentred in the &s;tomach, from which part it went off on the cri&s;is of the fever, which took place on the fourth and fifth days. The pre&s;&s;ure in his brea&s;t continued &s;ome days after, and the legs, which &s;uffered an excruciating pain and &s;orene&s;s, exactly &s;i|milar
<PB N="16" REF="033890_0016_0ffa560f9ec2aa10">to the tooth-ache, remained &s;o feeble that for &s;ix weeks after he was unable to mount his hor&s;e without a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>In another in&s;tance, the per&s;on attacked was at his u&s;ual employment in the printing-office of the Bee, &s;tanding near an open window, when an offen&s;ive &s;mell was perceived from a neighbouring hou&s;e where they were removing a per&s;on who was dying with the fever. The windows were immediately &s;hut, but he felt a nau|&s;ea and want of appetite, until about twelve o'clock at night, when he was violently attacked by the common &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e. Although he was of a &s;an|guinary con&s;titution and always per&s;pired freely on the &s;lighte&s;t occa&s;ion, the medicines given to excite a per|&s;piration produced not the &s;malle&s;t effect, the body was in&s;tantly rendered co&s;tive, no kind of phy&s;ic would ope|rate, and every &s;ymptom rapidly increa&s;ed. At length, in thirty hours from the commencement of the attack, the fever gave way, the co&s;tivene&s;s abating on the &s;e|cond bleeding, large drops of &s;weat bur&s;t out on every part of the body, the medicines remained on the &s;to|mach, the vomiting cea&s;ed, the pain dimini&s;hed, and the patient &s;oon recovered.</P>
<P>In another ca&s;e, in a corpulent &s;ubject, the di&s;ea&s;e went off by a profu&s;e natural &s;weat, without any medi|cal a&s;&s;i&s;tance whatever.</P>
<P>In another, a &s;evere attack was carried off by a very powerful do&s;e of Lee's New-London Bilious Pills; and in others it yielded to repeated purges alone.</P>

<HEAD>Mi&s;cellaneous ob&s;ervations.</HEAD>
<P>ON ca&s;ting an eye over the li&s;t of per&s;ons decea&s;|ed, it will be readily ob&s;erved, that the ravages of this di&s;ea&s;e were not confined to any particular de|&s;cription of people, but embraced indi&s;criminately all
<PB N="17" REF="033890_0017_0ffa5622a2feb5b0">who came within its reach. It is true, tho&s;e of a &s;an|guinary con&s;titution or vitiated habit &s;uffered more &s;e|verely than others, few of them recovering from an at|tack; but in general, as noted before re&s;pecting a cer|tain &s;pace, not many of any habit or con&s;titution e&s;cap|ed infection. It was not here, as in &s;ome places, that the contagion &s;hewed it&s;elf only in parts unu&s;ually filthy or confined. The hou&s;es where it appeared were ge|nerally large, not crowded with inhabitants, and be|longing to per&s;ons of re&s;pectability. And the mortality &s;wept off perhaps a greater proportion of the wealthy than of any other cla&s;s of citizens. It will al&s;o be re|marked that more men than women have died of the di&s;order, in the proportion of about four to three. But this will not appear &s;trange, when we con&s;ider that men, by the nature of their employment, are more ex|po&s;ed to attacks than women; their bu&s;ine&s;s calls them into the &s;treets, hou&s;es, &s;hops, &amp;c. where the di&s;ea&s;e rages, while their wives are employed at home in do|me&s;tic concerns; and thus they alone have been taken off by the pe&s;tilence, while the re&s;t of their families, remaining out of the infected limits, have continued in perfect &s;afety.</P>
<P>IT was carefully remarked, during the progre&s;s of this di&s;ea&s;e, that the infection was confined to a parti|cular part of the city, and was not &s;pread or commu|nicated by infected per&s;ons, clothes, or other &s;ub&s;tan|ces. People who had been in the infected part &s;ome|times carried the di&s;ea&s;e out with them, and there died with it; but without any other per&s;on receiving the in|fection from them. Two or three &s;olitary in&s;tances, in|deed, occurred, where the di&s;ea&s;e was taken from an infected per&s;on, without any previous communication with the contagious &s;pot. General Marvin, an emi|nent phy&s;ician of Norwich, was attacked while attend|ing Mr. Stewart, at Mr. Haughton's, &s;even miles from
<PB N="18" REF="033890_0018_0ffa5641c5fe5ce0">the city, and went home and died. But no other per|&s;on, it is believed, was taken off by the di&s;order, with|out having been nur&s;ing, or otherwi&s;e in the infected &s;pot: and in general, tho&s;e who lived at only a few rods di&s;tance, and avoided any nearer approach, were as &s;ecure from the effects of the fever as though they had removed an hundred miles in the country.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH people generally made u&s;e of &s;ome kind of preventative again&s;t infection, &s;uch as &s;moking tobacco, chewing garlic, and &s;melling of vinegar, cam|phor, &amp;c. yet it was not ob&s;erved in the end that they were thereby pre&s;erved from the effects of the di&s;ea&s;e. Many died of it, who were the mo&s;t careful to guard again&s;t it; while others who took no manner of pre|caution whatever e&s;caped. It &s;hould neverthele&s;s be remembered, that temperance was here the be&s;t pre|&s;ervative; and a habit kept open by gentle do&s;es of phy&s;ic taken occa&s;ionally was by far the mo&s;t advanta|geous to encounter the di&s;order.</P>
<P>IN the commencement of this di&s;ea&s;e very few e&s;|caped who were &s;everely attacked. But as the wea|ther grew more temperate, and the phy&s;icians became better acquainted with the nature of the di&s;order, they re&s;cued more from its devouring rage; and in the la&s;t &s;tages of its duration it but &s;eldom proved fatal. The whole number who were &s;ick is computed at 350, of whom le&s;s than one fourth died. At fir&s;t &s;carcely a third &s;urvived; but the mortality was le&s;s in proportion as the di&s;ea&s;e advanced, and towards its termination, of tho&s;e who were affected nearly nine out of ten reco|vered.</P>

<HEAD>Moral reflections.</HEAD>
<P>IN times like the&s;e, how many circum&s;tances occur to wound the &s;en&s;ibility and pain the heart! Such an
<PB N="19" REF="033890_0019_0ffa56595fe91528">uncommon and alarming calamity could not fail to pro|duce the mo&s;t unexpected effects on the minds of peo|ple. Thus it has been &s;een, when children have been attacked by this plague, that parents, forgetting the accu&s;tomed duties of humanity, and attentive only to their per&s;onal &s;afety, have refu&s;ed even to &s;ee their off|&s;pring, and &s;uffered them to peri&s;h without their a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. Others have been de&s;erted by their brethren and &s;i&s;ters, and died without beholding their counte|nances. Parents have been for&s;aken by their children, and had their eyes clo&s;ed by &s;trangers. And even the clo&s;er ties of hu&s;band and wife have been di&s;regarded by the dread in&s;pired by this terrible di&s;ea&s;e. Could it be believed that &s;uch things would have exi&s;ted in an enlightened chri&s;tian land? Yet &s;uch things were &s;een in America, and &s;omething nearly approaching to them in New-London; and &s;uch will ever be the ca&s;e in any country where an all-de&s;troying pe&s;tilence makes its dreadful appearance. Humanity, friend&s;hip, parental and filial affection, are all &s;wallowed up in the terror that anxiety for our own pre&s;ervation excites; and we fly on the wings of fear to any place of &s;ecurity, leav|ing every other concern behind. The&s;e remarks, how|ever, mu&s;t be under&s;tood as applying only to tho&s;e ti|mid per&s;ons who are frightened at the lea&s;t &s;ymptom of danger, and want &s;ufficient &s;trength of mind to ena|ble them to li&s;ten to the voice of rea&s;on or obey its dictates. Others of a different temperament nothing can alarm or tempt from their duty; and on occa&s;ions like this their &s;ervices are an invaluable acqui&s;ition.</P>
<P>WHAT &s;triking in&s;tances of the tran&s;itorine&s;s of life does &s;uch a di&s;ea&s;e afford! We &s;ee men exulting in the bloom of youth and prime of health and &s;trength, in three or four &s;hort days numbered with the dead. Our gaye&s;t companions, our lovelie&s;t friends, in le&s;s than a week are laid in the du&s;t. When we are daily
<PB N="20" REF="033890_0020_0ffa1a995da06578">witne&s;&s;ing the&s;e &s;cenes around us, who can avoid re|flecting, often and feelingly, that <HI>his turn may be next</HI>! Yet the mind, when habituated to the mo&s;t afflictive and extraordinary events, becomes hardened, and views them with unconcern and indifference. Di&s;ea&s;e and death, the mo&s;t dreadful accidents that can afflict the human frame, when made familiar to the &s;ight, cea&s;e to in&s;pire dread, and are ranked with the mo&s;t common occurrences.</P>
