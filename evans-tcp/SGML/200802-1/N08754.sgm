<P>NOW there was in the reign of G***** the king, a mighty &s;pirit of tribulation. And the great men of the land were laying upon the people bur|thens of great weight, yea, heavier burthens than were home by their fathers, or their fathers farthers before them. And they cried out unto the elders, and complained for lack of relief. (Now the elders were deaf to their cries, and they minded not the daily lamentation which they made) And they cri|ed yet louder and louder, &s;o that the whole land was pierced with the &s;ound thereof. And behold, in proce&s;s of time, that there aro&s;e up a man, (who
<PB N="7" REF="011191_0007_0F85CD5DB6238EE0">
was al&s;o an elder, and a colonel of the guard, in the land of Buckingham) who had compa&s;&s;ion upon them; and he opened his mouth, and &s;aid, Of a truth I perceive that you are oppre&s;&s;ed and agrieved, and that your ta&s;k-ma&s;ters lay upon you more than you are able to bear. Behold I my&s;elf will &s;peak unto this people who do evil continually, and will require a rea&s;on for that which they now do. Be ye therefore, patient, having peace among your&s;elves, and you &s;hall be filled. Now it came to pa&s;s that af|ter a &s;hort time this good man did as he promi&s;ed unto the people. And he &s;poke time after time of their tribulation, and wrote even letters with his own hand, complaining of the rulers in a free country. And behold, they were affronted thereat, and they were full of envy again&s;t this man, becau&s;e he had &s;poken well of the people. And when it was &s;o that he had wrote even a forty-fifth letter unto them, that they took him out of the hou&s;e of his habitati|on, and put him into a fa&s;t place, which place is called a tower even unto this day. And they look|ed into his dwelling, and &s;earched for his papers, and all his &s;ecret workings, and they took them every one. And behold, when they had found the&s;e, that they took him from the fa&s;t place, and bani&s;hed him afar off beyond the &s;ea. And he was left there, and commanded not to return; for behold it was &s;eemly unto the elders that he &s;hould be put away from among&s;t them.</P>

<P>WHATSOEVER things were written aforetime, were written for our learning, that we thro' in&s;truction and under&s;tanding, might &s;ee into the depths thereof. Now the great &s;ecret is found out which was before hid from our eyes, and we &s;ee clear|ly as at noon day. In the beginning was a favou|rite, and this favourite was B***, and B*** was with the K***. Many were the things wrought by him, and without him was not any evil done that was
<PB N="9" REF="011191_0009_0F85CD5F424C5160">
done. In him was pride, and that pride was found to be the de&s;truction of men Now there was a man returned from the land whereunto he was &s;ent, and al&s;o per&s;ecuted, who&s;e name was Wilkes, the &s;ame came back for a plague unto evil doers, And he abode within the gates of the city many days, and put his name among tho&s;e who were to be cho&s;en elders of the land. But they ca&s;t him from among them &s;o that he was not one of the elect, and he went his way. Howbeit he had in another roll his name written (as is recorded in the Chronicles) and he was cho&s;en. Now when B*** heard there|of, and &s;aw what they had done among&s;t them, he was very wroth, and wi&s;t not what to do, for this &s;ame man had &s;tung him aforetime So he &s;tirred up his fellows again&s;t him, to per&s;ecute him, that he might not abide with them. And behold they grew exceeding powerful, in&s;omuch that they took him away from the people, and put him in a &s;trong hold. And the people grew very wroth, and was di&s;plea|&s;ed thereat. And they a&s;&s;embled in great compa|nies by thou&s;ands, and would not be at re&s;t, becau&s;e of the things which were done. And they made great noi&s;es together; and many got for them&s;elves chalk which was white for to make a mark on every man as he pa&s;&s;ed, thus, 45 And this mark was put upon the coverings of the heads and the backs of all who pa&s;&s;ed this way or that way in honour of their great idols, Wilkes and Liberty. Until the even of many days did they do the&s;e things.</P>

He not only prophe&s;ies in <HI>general terms,</HI> but is al&s;o parti|cularly careful re&s;pecting the <HI>time</HI> and <HI>place</HI> when and where the&s;e things &s;hall come to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>A fox, &s;ays he, &s;hall come from the NORTH&mdash; a lion from the SOUTH&mdash; and there &s;hall come <HI>distre&s;&s;es</HI> in THIS great city&mdash;and in THESE days
<PB N="14" REF="011191_0014_0F85CD63C7655F20">
locu&s;ts &s;hall over&s;pread the face of the land. So you find, my brethren, that when the fox is come from the <HI>north</HI> &mdash;and the he-lion has rouzed him&s;elf in the <HI>&s;outh</HI>&mdash; di&s;tre&s;&s;es and tumults are to be expected in the city, and over the whole face of the land; and, that hundreds and thou&s;ands of oppre&s;&s;ed people &s;hall ri&s;e up together&mdash;and, when the&s;e things are &s;o far accompli&s;hed, then, in THESE days, locu&s;ts &s;hall come in upon us and dwell on the land.</P>
<P>Having thus con&s;idered the words in general, as they &s;tand before us, it may be nece&s;&s;ary, for the further illu&s;tration of this pa&s;&s;age, to con&s;ider particularly,</P>
<P N="1">I. What we are to under&s;tand by <HI>A fox coming from the North.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. How, and in what manner, <HI>a he-lion is to rouze him&s;elf in the &s;outh,</HI> and why <HI>they &s;hall be at war, and &s;hall not dwell at quiet.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. Con&s;ider what <HI>di&s;tre&s;&s;es and tumults &s;hall op|pre&s;s the land,</HI> &s;o that the <HI>oppre&s;&s;ed &s;hall ri&s;e up by hun|dreds and by thou&s;ands.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. Give &s;ome de&s;cription of the locu&s;ts which are to <HI>over&s;pread the face of the whole land.</HI> And,</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Conclude with &s;ome practical improve|ment upon the whole. And,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> What we are to under&s;tand by <HI>A fox co|ming from the north.</HI></P>
<P>It may appear nece&s;&s;ary, for the right apprehen|ding of the text, now under our con&s;ideration, that the book of <HI>Prophecies,</HI> was, originally, wrote in London; and therefore, when the prophet &s;ays, <HI>"even</HI> in this <HI>great city,"</HI> he mu&s;t be under&s;tood to mean <HI>that</HI> place: and of cour&s;e it follows, that the land &s;poken of is no other than that of <HI>South-Britain,</HI> on the north of which lieth that part which is called <HI>Scotland,</HI> from whence our admired penman hath in|formed us the <HI>fox</HI> &s;hould come.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="011191_0015_0F85CD646F7DC6A0">And, as it may not be altogether di&s;agreeable, or in the lea&s;t unworthy the notice of my hearers, I will fir&s;t give a &s;hort de&s;cription of the&s;e animals, and then proceed. In general, foxes are very remarkable for their deep cunning. They will, when pur&s;ued by hunters, make urine on their tails, and &s;trike them upon the faces of the dogs. When trapped by a gin, they have been known to bite of the part con|fined, and &s;o e&s;caped. And being hungry, they feign them&s;elves dead, on whom the fowls lighting, for prey, they ri&s;e and devour them. But, as there are different kinds of foxes, &s;o their artful inventi|ons are as various. That kind of fox, mentioned by the prophet, the generality of commentators agree to be the BOOT-FOX, and de&s;cribe him with an extraordinary long head, &s;mooth tongue, and remar|kable long eyes. His legs are covered with a kind of mottled, woolly furr, though bare at the joints of his knees, and his feet to be cloven. This fox, my beloved, it is well known, has been among&s;t us for &s;ome time, and did, originally, come from the north, an&s;wering every de&s;cription that is given of him by the Prophet in the former part of this chapter, be|ginning at the &s;ixteenth ver&s;e: <HI>And the fox that &s;hall appear in high places, and, by his cunning, get even in|to the hou&s;es of the mo&s;t high, &s;hall be a favourite fox. He &s;hall feed upon dainties, and he &s;hall have influence over many foxes; yea, and lambs &s;hall lie down before him and do reverence. But the lions of &s;pirit, and the wolves, and their young ones, &s;hall &s;eek his de&s;truction continually.</HI> From hence it is plain, that this &s;ame fox is now among&s;t us, and has been &s;een COUR<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ing it up and down in high fore&s;ts, and, by his &s;ecret fawnings, and dete&s;table undermining attempss, he
<PB N="16" REF="011191_0016_0F85CD68EE7791A0">
has got into good feed, and that, as it were, unob|&s;erved. We have, my brethren, too long borne with his ferriting &s;cratches; we have already rea&s;on to cur&s;e the time that ever &s;uch an animal exi&s;ted among&s;t us. O my beloved, take care! be upon the watch! this hungry Reynard &s;till lives&mdash;&s;till acts&mdash; &s;till rules! and unle&s;s the other part of this prophecy had taken place, we had been utterly undone for ever. Having con&s;idering thus far, I &s;hall proceed, in the next place, to &s;hew,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> How, and what manner, <HI>a he-lion is to rouze him&s;elf in the &s;outh,</HI> and why they <HI>&s;hall be at war with each other,</HI> &s;o as never to <HI>dwell at quiet.</HI> If our eyes my beloved, have been in the lea&s;t open, we &s;urely mu&s;t have perceived, that the words of the Prophet, in this point al&s;o, have been fully veri|fied and brought to pa&s;s.&mdash;<HI>Yea, and a he-lion &s;hall rouze him&s;elf in the</HI> SOUTH; that is, A he-lion &s;hall rouze him&s;elf in ENGLAND You cannot be ig|norant, nay, you mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that, of all bea&s;ts, the lion is the mo&s;t courageous. The plea&s;ing con|tra&s;t the Prophet hath here drawn, by way of &s;imile, cannot be &s;ufficiently admired. Than the fox and the lion nothing can be more directly appo&s;ite; not only the figure and &s;ize, but nature and principle. The one, unu&s;ed to &s;lattery and deceit, timidity and cow|ardice; the other, a noted partaker of each. With principles thus contra&s;ted, no wonder that each on each &s;hould ca&s;t &s;o black an eye, and be at variance, and &s;hould not <HI>dwell at quiet.</HI> We well know, how|ever, that when a lion is brought from abroad, in order to be brought under &s;ome re&s;traint, he is con|fined in a pri&s;on, wherein he may be kept from di&s;|turbing the quiet of tho&s;e foxes that are generally the mo&s;t crafty, and are the mo&s;t afraid of him. My
<PB N="17" REF="011191_0017_0F85CD6904CCF160">
brethren, apply this particular to the times in which we live: behold and &s;ee if nothing of this kind hath yet come to pa&s;s among&s;t us. It was the way of the antients to write by way of fable, and our prophet hath thought proper to adopt that plea&s;ing method above all others. To explain this part of our text, it may not be ami&s;s, therefore, to remark here, what we are to under&s;tand by a HE-LION. This accord|ing to the &s;en&s;e of the learned, can mean no other than the re&s;olute Patriot, who has &s;o much exerted him&s;elf in the behalf of his country; who has ever kept a jealous eye on the de&s;igns and mean artifices of the favourite <HI>boot-fox,</HI> and gloriou&s;ly brought to open light what fear and cowardice have been always a&s;hamed to reveal. It is the noble ex|ertion of this lion that hath &s;o terrified the whole ne&s;t of foxes. He has, like <HI>Sam&s;on,</HI> knit them all toge|ther, tail to tail, with a firebrand between each two, from which di&s;tre&s;s and entanglement they know not how to extricate and deliver them&s;elves. By way of trial they have, however, ca&s;t him into a den; ne|verthele&s;s, he &s;till continues to cau&s;e in them a dread, that ea&s;ily they cannot conquer and overcome: &s;o that <HI>they &s;till are at war with each other, and do not dwell at quiet.</HI>&mdash;Proceed we now to con&s;ider,</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> What di&s;tre&s;&s;es and tumults &s;hould op|pre&s;s the land, &s;o that <HI>the oppre&s;&s;ed &s;hall ri&s;e up by hun|dreds and by thou&s;ands.</HI> And fir&s;t, my brethren, I &s;hall con&s;ider the di&s;tre&s;&s;es&mdash;Tho&s;e who are any way acquainted with life and the world, mu&s;t, of con&s;e|quence, perceive, how di&s;tre&s;s and mi&s;ery fill our &s;treets. For the want of a proper &s;upply of provi&s;i|ons, and the common nece&s;&s;aries of life, how many of our poor have been &s;natched off in their prime! Others advanced to old age, grey-hair'd &s;ubjects,
<PB N="18" REF="011191_0018_0F85CD69E5FB86A8">
tender fathers, affectionatte mothers, loyal friends, and hone&s;t Britons, O! how have they been taken from among&s;t us by the cruel u&s;age of Poverty and Want! When corn and provi&s;ions have been plenty; when Providence hath crowned our harve&s;ts with abundance; how have our poor been debarred from partaking thereof, while the owners have &s;tored their barns, and kept it &s;hamefully back from tho&s;e who were &s;tarving with hunger. Not only were the&s;e practices, beloved, pa&s;&s;ed over and winked at by men in power, but at that time it was known to be carried abroad to enemies&mdash;open enemies&mdash;profe&s;|&s;ed enemies! and &s;old cheaper to them, by far, than we could po&s;&s;ibly purcha&s;e at home. Add to this, the large quantities of wheat continually being ca&s;t into the waters, which by long &s;tanding, had been &s;poilt, and rendered u&s;ele&s;s&mdash;even to the DESPISED POOR.</P>
<P>Who then can wonder at the ri&s;ings of the people or be amazed at the tumults (not abroad, but) at home? Is there not rea&s;on&mdash;&s;ufficient rea&s;on for the&s;e murmurings and complaints among the lower cla&s;s of the people? The Prophet might very well lay a particular empha&s;is here&mdash;<HI>and the oppre&s;&s;ed</HI> SHALL <HI>ri&s;e up, &amp;c.</HI>&mdash;Never had people more oc|ca&s;ion to exert what little &s;pirit they had left in their own cau&s;e, before they were utterly de&s;troyed.&mdash; Thus things were going on in a very <HI>foul</HI> way for their de&s;truction. They &s;aw them, and were wi&s;e. Fair and humble means were at fir&s;t tried; petitions were offered; &s;upplications were made to men in power, and to UNFEELING mini&s;ters who&s;e con|tinual promi&s;es were, They WOULD a&s;&s;i&s;t;&mdash;pro|vi&s;ions SHOULD lowered in their prices, and they might rely upon their IMMEDIATE con&s;iderati|on
<PB N="19" REF="011191_0019_0F85CD6A73679F48">
on and di&s;patch. The&s;e promi&s;es, we are now &s;en|&s;ible, were made to appea&s;e the noi&s;e of the VUL|GAR, as they are &s;tiled, for never was any thing done in their behalf in con&s;equence of tho&s;e <HI>promi&s;es,</HI> and they were left to &s;hift for them&s;elves, and to do as well as people in their &s;ituation were capable of doing, without THEIR a&s;&s;i&s;tance.&mdash;In this manner were they kept in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, &s;tarving and to &s;tarve, till Nece&s;&s;ity (the mother of invention) taught them how to ri&s;e in large bodies together, no longer to pray, but to demand. Then came forth, <HI>even in this great city,</HI> multitudes of machanics, various in their profe&s;&s;ions, and firm in their re&s;olutions, exer|ting them&s;elves in their own defence, chu&s;ing ra|ther to fall by the &s;word, than be in the mid&s;t of plenty dying for the want of proper &s;u&s;tenance and nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>Thus I have briefly con&s;idered the <HI>di&s;tre&s;&s;es</HI> and <HI>tumults</HI> which have come to pa&s;s, according to the prophecy of the Prophet. I come now to give &s;ome de&s;cription of the <HI>locu&s;ts</HI> which are to over&s;pread the face of the whole land.</P>
<P><HI>And in the&s;e days, &amp;c.</HI> As there are of foxes &s;eve|rals kinds, &s;o of locu&s;ts the &s;ame. But, in general, every &s;pecies of this in&s;ect are accounted vile. Their nature is to herd many together, therefore va&s;t mul|titudes are re&s;embled by them. In <HI>Arabia,</HI> as well as in <HI>England,</HI> the people are infe&s;ted with them; but, in the&s;e times, they more particularly infe&s;t the latter. They generally come upon <HI>corn,</HI> when ripe, and what they do not <HI>eat,</HI> they infect with their <HI>touch.</HI> They die whole &s;warms together; and, after death, they poi&s;on the air, and cau&s;e a pe&s;tilence.&mdash;How happy our prophetic writer appears in his expre&s;&s;ions and &s;imilies, I leave to the determination of my hea|rers!
<PB N="20" REF="011191_0020_0F85CD6B32268BF8">
Nothing could have been more to the pur|po&s;e in an&s;wering his de&s;ign to paint to the people the events of futurity, in this re&s;pect, than that of the <HI>locu&s;t.</HI> According to the de&s;cription I have given of that in&s;ect, how &s;triking a re&s;emblance does it bear with the &s;warm of vile locu&s;ts which was daily found in the we&s;tern patt of our renouned city, where numbers have been &s;een to a&s;&s;emble together in companies and flights, to accompli&s;h their evil de&s;igns. In the twelfth chapter of the <HI>Prophecies,</HI> the Prophet takes notice of the time when they di&s;|appear, and what events follow, from ver&s;e 88 to ver&s;e 92. <HI>Now after the locu&s;ts &s;hall have perplexed the people, and have been even in one place years two and five, they &s;hall divide them&s;elves apart. And it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, that when the old locu&s;ts &s;hall die away, that there &s;hall be great joy and fea&s;ting among the people. But behold, they &s;hall fear the coming of another &s;warm, for they &s;hall not know what they &s;hall do. And the people &s;hall be divided among&s;t them&s;elves what manner of &s;warm it &s;hall be. But the beginning thereof &s;hall be de&s;tructive unto many.</HI> I have my be|loved, quoted thus much that ye be not mi&s;guided: locu&s;ts are among&s;t you; they are even come with a great power: and, though the la&s;t &s;warm are &s;epe|rated, and are gone; yet, take care, the beginning of the&s;e, you perceive, <HI>have</HI> already been de&s;tructive unto many.</P>
<P>Having thus gone through the principal parts which I at fir&s;t intended, I now proceed to &s;ome practical improvement upon the whole, and will have done. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. Seeing that a fox is come from the north, let us be watchful, and extremely jealous, of every mo|tion that may be made of his exertion. His cun|ning
<PB N="21" REF="011191_0021_0F85CD6BF5598438">
is deep; his attempts &s;ly; and deceit artful. He may be found to make urine of the &s;tronge&s;t taint upon his tail, and clo&s;e your eyes in &s;uch a man|ner, that we cannot pur&s;ue him in his intrigues. He may feign dead or inactive, but at la&s;t rouze up and devour a multitude. It requires, therefore, the greate&s;t diligence and per&s;everance to prevent his becoming our dete&s;table and inveterate de&s;troyer.</P>
<P N="2">2. As we are incouraged by the pre&s;ence of a li|on, we ought not to be ca&s;t down, grieve our &s;pirits, and faint, as though no pro&s;pect of help were nigh.&mdash; The lion is a furious bea&s;t; hard&s;hips and difficul|ties, which appear &s;o to us, become as nothing to him; and we have already found, that his power ALONE hath defended us in our Hou&s;es&mdash;in our Ca&s;tles&mdash;in our Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. We &s;hould therefore be thankful, and rejoice that there is one power provided again&s;t another, &s;o that our attempts, for the liberty of our children, do not entirely become of non-effect.</P>
<P N="3">3. In all times of public di&s;tre&s;s and tumultuous proceedings, we &s;hould be particularly careful how we think and act, neither to be &s;een defending our own cau&s;e, or walking by the way-&s;ide <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alluding to that meritorious action in St. George's fields, namely, the fireing upon and killing &s;everal of his maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, as they were &s;atisfying their curio&s;ity thereabouts in &s;eeing Mr. (now Alderman) Wilkes.</NOTE>, le&s;t either by fire or &s;word we be de&s;troyed, and our lives taken away. In &s;hort, my brethren, to be in favour with the GREAT, let your conver&s;ation be nought, lie down peaceably and be trod upon, re&s;i&s;ting none who im|po&s;e upon you, and then! * * * * and then! * * * * O then!</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="22" REF="011191_0022_0F85CD6D0A2CD7D8">4. Seeing that locu&s;ts of a new kind are come up|on us, let us behold them a while in their actions. If they oppre&s;s us, and, as the la&s;t &s;warm, bla&s;t every gleam of hope, that may appear favourable in our behalf, we may expect little good from them. if they direct them&s;elves by the NORTH wind, and are governed by that cold corner, it is rea&s;on|able to expect that we &s;hall &s;oon be in a &s;tarving condition, &s;ince that wind carries with it a mo&s;t omenous a&s;pect, of which we have been the too &s;ad and uncomfortable &s;pectators.</P>
<P>To conclude. Let every one be upon their guard. Whatever appears in the &s;trict eye of Rea|&s;on, to carry with it the impre&s;&s;ion of Truth, a ta&s;te of true Patrioti&s;m, and a love of Liberty and an univer&s;al Freedom, by all means let that be fir&s;t embraced. And I tru&s;t, my brethren, that the&s;e few hints, which I have ju&s;t thrown together, will not be unworthy your notice. May this di&s;cour&s;e have its de&s;ired effect upon you, and promote, in &s;ome degree, your fortitude and courage under every impo&s;ition that may be lain upon you by a &s;et of arbitrary ******* and ******.
