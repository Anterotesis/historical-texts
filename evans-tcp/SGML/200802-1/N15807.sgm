<Q><BIBL>St. Mark, XVI.15, 16.</BIBL>
<P>AND HE SAID UNTO THEM, GO YE INTO ALL THE WORLD, AND PREACH THE GOSPEL TO EVERY CREATURE: HE THAT BELIEVETH AND IS BAPTIZED, SHALL BE SAVED; BUT HE THAT BELIEVETH NOT, SHALL BE DAMNED.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS is the important commi&s;&s;ion given by the ble&s;&s;ed Head of the Church to the apo&s;tles, the fir&s;t mini&s;ters in his kingdom; and in them to all who &s;hould be in future au|thorized to publi&s;h the glad tidings of his &s;al|vation, in all &s;ucceeding generations to the end of the world. In the&s;e words, the extent of our mi&s;&s;ion is mentioned&mdash;the nature of our errand unfolded,&mdash;and the conditions of &s;alvation, we are to publi&s;h in the name of our ble&s;&s;ed ma&s;ter, are expre&s;sly declared. To this divine rule you are then to look, would you know whether we deviate from our commi&s;&s;ion or not</P>
<P>This Di&s;cour&s;e is not de&s;igned to prove the truth of the chri&s;tian religion: It is addre&s;&s;ed to tho&s;e only who declare them&s;elves chri&s;tians, and profe&s;s to believe that the go&s;pel is the on|ly charter of hope to men: It therefore pro|ceeds upon chri&s;tian principles, takes for granted that the bible is true, and undertakes to &s;hew by &s;cripture what the go&s;pel promi&s;eth to do for men, and upon what terms we may hope for the rewards of it.</P>
<P>The go&s;pel &s;cheme is built upon a &s;ufficient
<PB N="6" REF="020201_0005_0FAE3CED558118B0">
atonement, which is already made to divine ju&s;tice for &s;in. The bible informs, that ori|ginally <HI>God made man upright,</HI> put him un|der a certain law, and declared death to be the award of di&s;obedience to it&mdash;that man how|ever tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, and &s;tood expo&s;ed to the pe|nalty&mdash;but that Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the &s;econd per|&s;on in the &s;acred trinity, undertook his re&s;tora|tion, and accompli&s;hed it by his own &s;uffer|ings and death in the place of the offender.</P>
<P>The generally received doctrine of the chri&s;tian church is, and has been, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t, having ran&s;omed human nature by paying the price of our redemption, &s;teps forth in his own right, as our Proprietor, King and Judge; enacts laws for us to ob&s;erve; and offers all the rewards of his purcha&s;e upon &s;uch terms as to his infinite wi&s;dom &s;eem pro|per. In a word, that the terms propo&s;ed are repentance of &s;in, and faith in the Redeemer.</P>
<P>In conformity to this faith of the Church of God, judging it to be fully and clearly &s;up|ported in divine revelation: I have con&s;tantly maintained, that there is no other name un|der heaven, than that of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by which men can be &s;aved&mdash;that HE hath re|deemed mankind&mdash;paid the price of our ran|&s;om; and is become our law-giver and judge&mdash; that in con&s;equence of his dominion over us, he has treated us as agents; enacted laws to bind us; and conde&s;cended to make a gracious
<PB N="7" REF="020201_0006_0FAE3CEE9431E048">
covenant with us in the go&s;pel, in which co|venant he promi&s;es to give us his &s;alvation, upon condition that we believe in him, &s;ubmit to his laws, and repent of our &s;ins&mdash;but has threatened to exclude us from the benefits of his purcha&s;e, if we continue in impenitence and unbelief&mdash;and that we mu&s;t therefore comply with the&s;e conditions, or &s;ubmit to a mi&s;erable eternity.</P>
<P>Many of you are my witne&s;&s;es, that <HI>this</HI> has uniformly been the great burden of my in|&s;tructions from my youth to the pre&s;ent day. The doctrine has al&s;o been univer&s;ally believed in this &s;ociety, where, for a cour&s;e of many years, unle&s;s I am mi&s;taken, there has been as perfect an uniformity of religious &s;entiment, as ever was in any congregation.</P>
<P>Happy, I &s;incerely believe, it had been for the town at large, and for this &s;ociety in par|ticular, had the doctrine never been oppo&s;ed: Of late, however, there are tho&s;e who deny the human race to be agents&mdash;that the go&s;pel is a covenant between God and men&mdash;or that it has any conditions of life in it&mdash;and who a&s;|&s;ert, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t having paid the whole debt to divine ju&s;tice, which every human creature had contracted by &s;in, that a &s;econd payment cannot be ju&s;tly required; and there|fore, however men may live here, the whole human nature mu&s;t and will be finally happy. This doctrine is in direct oppo&s;ition to what
<PB N="8" REF="020201_0007_0FAE3CF0198B2B58">
you have early and ever been taught. It ap|pears to cla&s;h with the words of our text; and it oppo&s;eth the whole &s;y&s;tem of the faith, I have ever believed and taught. Can I do le&s;s than to examine it candidly by the word of God?</P>
<P>I am now to take my final leave of my country, and of this my charge; upon both which I earne&s;tly wi&s;h and implore every di|vine ble&s;&s;ing, which may conduce to their comfort here, and their happine&s;s forever. But how can I expect the accompli&s;hment of this wi&s;h, unle&s;s I leave them e&s;tabli&s;hed in the truth?&mdash;rooted and grounded in the faith and order of the go&s;pel? Should the doctrine I op|po&s;e be found true, I &s;hould think it an honor to retract my pre&s;ent mi&s;take; and this di&s;|po&s;ition I hope to find in others. However, &s;hould the doctrine you all have till of late re|ceived, be found &s;upported by God's word, it mu&s;t be my duty to call upon you, to <HI>hold fa&s;t the beginning of Your confidence and hope.</HI> My obligation to you as a &s;piritual in&s;tructor, and my higher obligation to the great Head of the Church as his emba&s;&s;adour, con&s;pire to de|mand this of me.</P>
<P>"Men, Brethren and Fathers, hear ye therefore my defence, which I now make unto you". The words of the text prove, that all men &s;hall not be &s;aved by go&s;pel, unle&s;s all men &s;hall believe it.&mdash;They are the very words
<PB N="9" REF="020201_0008_0FAE3CF0B0D0EAF0" MS="y">
of the great Redeemer him&s;elf, who has ran+&s;omed us from death; and they contain the terms upon which only HE has ordered the go&s;pel to be publi&s;hed</P>
<P>The words are addre&s;&s;ed to the apo&s;tles; and the&s;e fir&s;t chri&s;tian mini&s;ters are directed to <HI>go into all the world, and preach the go&s;pel to every creature</HI>; then follow the very words of the go&s;pel they were to publi&s;h. <HI>He that believeth and is baptized, &s;hall be &s;aved; but he that believ|eth not, &s;hall be damned.</HI> When we know the true import of the&s;e words, we &s;hall al&s;o know what the conditions of &s;alvation are, which Chri&s;t has fixed.</P>
<P><HI>To believe and be baptized</HI> mu&s;t &s;ignify, not only to believe that Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t; but to repent of our &s;ins, and &s;ubmit to his govern|ment; for &s;o much Chri&s;t hath el&s;ewhere ex+pre&s;sly required. So, to be <HI>&s;aved,</HI> 'as this is Chri&s;t's gift,' mu&s;t intend the enjoyment of <HI>his</HI> &s;alvation.</P>
<P>And on the other hand, not to <HI>believe,</HI> mu&s;t &s;ignify, not only to deny Chri&s;t before men, but to reject his government: And to be <HI>damned</HI> mu&s;t be, to be rejected from the above &s;alvation.</P>
<P>Let the meaning of the word <HI>damned</HI> be <HI>con|demned,</HI> or <HI>judged,</HI> or however you interpret it, it &s;tands in direct oppo&s;ition to the word <HI>&s;aved.</HI> And if the unbeliever is not rejected from the &s;alvation to which the believer is admitted, the
<PB N="10" REF="020201_0009_0FAE3CF179B10B00">
pa&s;&s;age if left without meaning, nor can it be reconciled with common &s;en&s;e. In the pa&s;&s;age above, Chri&s;t admits the believer to his &s;alva|tion; but he condemns, or judgeth the unbe|liever to be unworthy of his &s;alvation; and this is to reject him from it. Neither does this interpretation re&s;t upon my authority; but upon the authority of the Redeemer him&s;elf, for thus he hath explained it. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John 3d, 36th.</NOTE> <HI>He that believeth on the Son, hath everla&s;ting life; and he that be|lieveth not on the Son, &s;hall not &s;ee life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.</HI> Chri&s;t here de|clares, the unbeliever &s;hall not &s;ee the life, which is given to the believer. Chri&s;t's &s;alvation is the life he has given to the believer, therefore he has rejected the unbeliever from his &s;alva|tion. He has declared he &s;hall not even &s;ee it. Can we have higher evidence that all men &s;hall not be &s;aved by go&s;pel, unle&s;s all men &s;hall finally believe it, that is, fulfil the con|ditions of it, than this explicit declaration of our ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer and final Judge? But why do I mention conditions, when it is deny|ed, that there are conditions in the go&s;pel? or indeed, that men are agents? or the go&s;pel a covenant between God and men? We will examine the&s;e particulars, before we proceed to the principal enquiry; which is, whether all men &s;hall finally believe the go&s;pel?</P>
<P>The fir&s;t inquiry is, whether men are <HI>agents?</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="020201_0010_0FAE3CF22B1CE550">
What we under&s;tand by an agent is, a being capable of in&s;truction, or able to under&s;tand, and to be governed by laws, or to be influenced by the &s;anctions of law. The laws and ci|vil con&s;titutions of every country prove, it is, and has been, the common con&s;ent of man|kind, that <HI>we</HI> are &s;uch beings; that is, beings capable to learn the meaning of law, and to be governed by the precepts of it; otherwi&s;e why were civil con&s;titutions ever framed? To give men laws, is to treat them as agents: that is, as beings capable of government by law, and to acknowledge it proper to enact laws to bind us, is to grant we are agents, or proper &s;ubjects of law: but God has given laws to bind us: he therefore has treated us as agents.</P>
<P>Should it be &s;aid, though we can obey the laws of <HI>men,</HI> we cannot obey the laws of <HI>God</HI>; therefore, though we are agents under human laws, we are not agents, or proper &s;ubjects of divine laws. This objection mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, ei|ther that God <HI>has</HI> given us no laws: or that he he has not treated us properly according to our condition&punc; We grant (as indeed we ought to do) that in our own &s;trength we are unable to keep even tho&s;e divine laws on which our &s;al|vation is &s;u&s;pended: But Chri&s;t in the go&s;pel has declared, that the aids of his &s;pirit &s;hall be of equal extent with his laws&mdash;that we &s;hall not be tempted above our ability&mdash;that his &s;trength &s;hall be perfected in our weakne&s;s&mdash;
<PB N="12" REF="020201_0011_0FAE3CF2ED7CE9A8">
and that it &s;hall be &s;ufficient for us. However impotent we are in our&s;elves, we want no other &s;trength than that which is <HI>&s;ufficient</HI> for us&mdash; and as the go&s;pel promi&s;es to give us <HI>&s;ufficient</HI> &s;trength, though it did not find us agents, it has rai&s;ed us to that capacity. All who be|lieve God has given a revelation to teach men their duty, mu&s;t believe them able to learn it: and they who grant that God has given laws to regulate our lives, ought to grant that we are agents, and able to be governed by law.</P>
<P>Will any men then, who acknowledge the authority of revelation, deny that God has giv|en laws to mankind? Who can deny that God gave a law to the fir&s;t two in innocency, and declared death to be the penalty of di&s;obe|dience to it? Who can deny the Decalogue, and the whole law of Mo&s;es, to be divine laws given to regulate the manners of men? Who will deny that God by Mo&s;es &s;et life and death before the Jewi&s;h nation, and referred it to them which they would chu&s;e, as though they really had the power of choice. Finally, who can deny that faith and repentance are laws of the go&s;pel, de&s;igned to bind men, when Chri&s;t commands men to repent and believe the go&s;pel, declares they &s;hall be &s;aved, if they do, but affirms they &s;hall not &s;ee life, if they do not? The truth is, from the day God made man to the pre&s;ent time, he has uniformly given laws to govern us: he has treated us as
<PB N="13" REF="020201_0012_0FAE3CF3AE7AF4D0">
beings capable of government by law, or as creatures able to choo&s;e and refu&s;e. And this is to treat us as agents. Clearly nothing more can be nece&s;&s;ary to make man an agent, than to be able to be governed by laws, inforced by rewards and puni&s;hments. God has always given &s;uch laws to men. However long we contend therefore, it will follow, either that we are agents, or that God has treated us im|properly. Which &s;ide of the alternative &s;hall we take?&mdash;we ought not, and we dare not &s;ay, God has treated us improperly: We therefore mu&s;t believe we are agents&punc; &s;ince God has treat|ed us as &s;uch.</P>
<P>But the next point is, whether there are <HI>con|ditions</HI> of life in the go&s;pel? A condition, is any thing upon which the enjoyment of a favour is &s;u&s;pended. When we do the thing required, we receive the benefit: When we do it not, we are rejected from the favour. The thing thus required is a condition of enjoyment; be|cau&s;e the enjoyment is not to take effect with|out a compliance with the condition. Let us examine whether &s;uch conditions of life are not to be found in the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Our ble&s;&s;ed Lord came to &s;ave men by the remi&s;&s;ion of their &s;ins When he entered upon his public mini&s;try, he declared the approach of his kingdom, and commanded men to re|pent and believe his go&s;pel. That he requires faith and repentance is clearly legible to every
<PB N="14" REF="020201_0013_0FAE3CF48D01DD50">
one who looks into his bible: He hath made faith and repentance the terms of his pardon and &s;alvation, and requires them, as the con|ditions of life which him&s;elf has fixed. Luke 24, 47. <HI>He has commanded repentance and re|mi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins to be preached in his name,</HI>&mdash;not remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins without repentance, but repentance fir&s;t, as a condition without which there &s;hould be no remi&s;&s;ion. As <HI>repentance</HI> is one condition of life in the go&s;pel; &s;o <HI>faith</HI> is another: Our ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer &s;aith, St. John, 3, 16, and 36. <HI>God &s;o loved the world, that he gave his only begotten &s;on, that who&s;oever be|lieveth in him &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;t|ing life. He that believeth on the &s;on, hath ever|la&s;ting Life; and he that believeth not the &s;on, &s;hall not &s;ee Life.</HI> Chri&s;t, the purcha&s;er and giver of life, has promi&s;ed it to the believer; but declared the unbeliever &s;hall not &s;ee life, but &s;hall remain under the wrath of God. Is not faith then a condition of life? Without faith, life is not promi&s;ed in the go&s;pel;&mdash;with faith, it is promi&s;&s;ed. Faith is then a condi|tion upon which the enjoyment of life is &s;u&s;|pended by the go&s;pel. If we expect &s;alvation by Chri&s;t, we mu&s;t look for it in the way in which he has promi&s;ed it. Chri&s;t has not &s;aid, we &s;hall be &s;aved without faith: Who dare &s;ay we &s;hall? Chri&s;t has declared the believer &s;hall receive his &s;alvation; but that the unbeliever &s;hall not receive it: Who dare &s;ay he &s;hall re|ceive
<PB N="15" REF="020201_0014_0FAE3CF5283390A0">
it? To clo&s;e the argument:&mdash;If the be|liever &s;hall enjoy life, and the unbeliever &s;hall not enjoy it, then faith is a condition of life. Je&s;us Chri&s;t has expre&s;sly declared this to be the ca&s;e: therefore Je&s;us Chri&s;t has made faith a condition of life.</P>
<P>Having proved that there are conditions of life in the go&s;pel, it will &s;oon appear that the go&s;|pel is a <HI>covenant</HI> between God and men. A co|venant is an agreement between two or more parties. In this ca&s;e God is one party, and men are the other. On his part, God promi&s;es life to men, upon the conditions of faith and repentance: On men's part, when they take the chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion upon them, they pro|mi&s;e to comply with the above conditions, as the way to enjoy the good things promi&s;ed. They who take this profe&s;&s;ion upon them, are &s;aid to enter into covenant,&mdash;nay, and bap|ti&s;m, the rite by which we compleat this a|greement, is called the <HI>&s;eal</HI> of the covenant. A covenant then there mu&s;t be, or there could be no <HI>&s;eal</HI> to it. But who are the parties in the covenant? Unque&s;tionably God and men are the parties: For they are the two parties which agree. Indeed, it is impo&s;&s;ible the covenant &s;hould be betwixt God and Chri&s;t. Tho' there might originally have been a covenant between the Father and the Son; yet this of which we now &s;peak, is not: For we are told, that Chri&s;t is the <HI>mediator</HI> of this covenant. A me|diator
<PB N="16" REF="020201_0015_0FAE3CF850383CA8">
is a middle per&s;on, and an interce&s;&s;or: But Chri&s;t cannot intercede betwixt God and him&s;elf,&mdash;nor can he &s;tand in the middle be|tween God and him&s;elf: But he mu&s;t medi|ate between God and his people, the two par|ties who have entered into the agreement. In conformity to this idea, the apo&s;tle ob&s;erves, that Chri&s;t is a mediator; but &s;aith, that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Galations 3d, 20th.</NOTE> <HI>a mediator is not a mediator of</HI> ONE; <HI>but God is one,</HI>&mdash;therefore he tells us, both that <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">1&s;t Timothy, 2d, 5th.</NOTE><HI>he is the mediator betwixt God and men,</HI> and <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. 12, 24th.</NOTE><HI>the media|tor of the new covenant.</HI> I &s;ee not then why it does not follow, with a force of evidence e|qually convincing with a mathematical de|mon&s;tration, that &s;ince Chri&s;t is the mediator of the new covenant&mdash;&s;ince he cannot be a me|diator of one, nor mediator betwixt God and him&s;elf,&mdash;but is the mediator between God and men, that the new covenant of which he is mediator, mu&s;t be a covenant between God and men.</P>
<P>The above ob&s;ervations &s;hew, that men are agents, becau&s;e God treats them as &s;uch&mdash;that the go&s;pel is a covenant between God and men, that it contains conditions of life&mdash;and that faith and repentance are the conditions of this covenant. It will from hence follow, that we mu&s;t fulfil the conditions of the covenant, or not expect the rewards of it. As we are agents, we are accountable to God for the improvement
<PB N="17" REF="020201_0016_0FAE3CF9B15A1C08">
of the powers he has given us. As go&s;pel pro|mi&s;es are conditional, we mu&s;t comply with the conditions, or not inherit the promi&s;es. Je&s;us Chri&s;t has paid the price of our ran&s;om: We are his in right of purcha&s;e: and he has an undoubted authority to di&s;po&s;e of us as he &s;hall judge proper.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t has promi&s;ed his &s;alvation to the be|liever: he has rejected the unbeliever from it. In the text he declares, he that believeth &s;hall be <HI>&s;aved</HI>; and he who believeth not, &s;hall be <HI>damn|ed.</HI> If we di&s;agree in the meaning of this la&s;t word, our Lord has declared it &s;ignifies, not to &s;ee or enjoy the life he has given to the be|liever. The&s;e are his words: <HI>He that believeth on the &s;on, hath everla&s;ting Life; he that be|lieveth not the &s;on, &s;hall not &s;ee Life.</HI> The&s;e are the words of our final judge, and they ab&s;o|lutely exclude the unbeliever from the life which is given to the believer; they declare he <HI>&s;hall not &s;ee</HI> or enjoy it. The life here promi&s;ed to the believer is Chri&s;t's &s;alvation. Chri&s;t's &s;al|vation is eternal life: For &s;peaking of his &s;heep, he &s;aith <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">St. John 10th, 28th.</NOTE> <HI>I give unto them eternal Life.</HI> The &s;alvation then, which is given to the believer, is eternal life; the unbeliever is rejected from the &s;alvation given to the believer; he there|fore is rejected from eternal life; and this too by the declaration of the judge him&s;elf.</P>
<P>It follows, either that we mu&s;t acknow|ledge
<PB N="18" REF="020201_0017_0FAE3CFB005F5640">
the final unbeliever is rejected from eter|nal life, or deny the po&s;itive, clear and ex|pre&s;s declaration of our Redeemer and Judge.</P>
<P>Moreover, this &s;entence of the judge will be executed upon the final unbeliever in the great day of retribution. For judgment is then to proceed according to the go&s;pel: And the bu|&s;ine&s;s of that important day is only to execute the promi&s;es and threatnings of the go&s;pel. As the unbeliever is totally excluded from eternal life, it will follow, either that all men will not be finally happy; or that all men will finally believe; Since without faith no one can be happy, no one can plea&s;e God, or enjoy him.</P>
<P>We therefore enquire whether all men &s;hall finally believe, or fulfil the conditions of the go&s;pel? That all men do not fulfil the&s;e con|ditions in the pre&s;ent life, may be thus argued. St. John ob&s;erves, that <HI>without</HI> (or out of the kingdom of Heaven) <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Revelations 22d, 15th</NOTE> "are &s;orcerers, whore|mongers, murderers, and idolaters." Had the&s;e men obeyed the go&s;pel in this life, they had not been excluded from Heaven: but would have taken part of the inheritance given to <HI>him who overcometh.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame thing may be argued from the ca&s;e of Dives and Lazarus. Lazarus died, and was carried by Angels into Abraham's bo&s;om&mdash; a place of joy and comfort. The other died, and lift up his eyes in torment. Why is this
<PB N="19" REF="020201_0018_0FAE3CFB2B0847F8">
difference made betwixt the two? The only rea&s;on which can be given is, the one had fulfil|ed the conditions of life, and the other had not. The one had faith, the other had it not. Had Dives in this life fulfiled the conditions to which Chri&s;t had promi&s;ed his &s;alvation, we now &s;hould not find him in torment, and hear him beg in vain for releif; but we &s;hould find him with Lazarus in a place of comfort. The&s;e in&s;tances are a demon&s;tration, that all men do not fulfil the conditions of the go&s;pel in this life, becau&s;e we find &s;ome men excluded from the rewards of it at death.</P>
<P>As all men do not fulfil go&s;pel conditions in this life, it remains to be done after death, if it is ever done. But &s;urely it cannot be done between death and the re&s;urrection. For our ble&s;&s;ed Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> us, death is a <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">St. John 9th, 4th.</NOTE><HI>night in which no man can <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI> And the apo&s;tle, that we are to be judged, for <HI>the things only</HI> which are <HI>done in the body.</HI> Soul and body are &s;eparated at death, and will remain in a &s;eparate &s;tate till the judg|ment &s;hall commence:&mdash;then they will be re|united&mdash;not for a &s;econd probation however; but to receive the ju&s;t award of the deeds done in the body before its &s;eparation from the &s;oul. Hence the apo&s;tle, <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">20. Corin. 5th, 10th.</NOTE><HI>we mu&s;t all appear before the judgment &s;eat of Chri&s;t, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</HI> So in the
<PB N="20" REF="020201_0019_0FAE3CFBEDDD68C8">
de&s;cription of the final judgment recorded by Sr. Matthew, our ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer awards tho&s;e on his right hand to happine&s;s, becau&s;e they had fed the hungry, &amp;c. Things which could be done no where but here in the body: and he al&s;o &s;entences tho&s;e on the left to mi&s;e|ry, for no other rea&s;on than becau&s;e they had neglected to do &s;uch good deeds upon earth.</P>
<P>I know it has been &s;aid, that <HI>devils</HI> only are on the left hand, and all mankind, bad and good, on the right: But this interpretation de&s;troys the great de&s;ign, both of this pa&s;&s;age, and of the go&s;pel at large. For doubtle&s;s the de&s;ign of both is, to encourage virtue, and di&s;|courage vice, by the different awards they &s;hould receive at this grand period: But place all men, good and bad, on the right hand, and adjudge them indi&s;criminately to happine&s;s, and this great de&s;ign is totally lo&s;t. It contains no motive to virtue, or di&s;couragement to vice; nor can you reconcile it with the wi&s;dom of God, or the rea&s;on of men. Be&s;ides, the crime for which tho&s;e on the left hand are puni&s;hed, does not agree with devils, but with men. Men are expected to feed the hungry; I never knew that devils were: Nor is this the crime for which they are to &s;uffer. The apo&s;tle tells us, that "God &s;pared not the angels which &s;inned, but ca&s;t them down to hell" They &s;inned before they were ca&s;t down; and they are re&s;erved in chains to the judgment of the great day, be|cau&s;e

<P>From the above ob&s;ervations it clearly fol|lows, that the judgment of the great day is the award of the things done in the body, and only of the things &s;o done. This award is made according to the terms of the go&s;pel.&mdash; For the apo&s;tle te&s;tifies, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> 2d. 16.</NOTE><HI>that God &s;hall judge the &s;ecrets of men by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, according to the go&s;pel.</HI> It appears further, that all men do not fulfil the terms of the go&s;pel in this life&mdash; that between death and judgment they cannot fulfil them, becau&s;e in this period nothing can be done for which we are to be judged: And it mu&s;t follow, that as &s;ome men are not within the conditions of life at the time of judgment, they mu&s;t then be rejected from &s;alvation.</P>
<P>The conclu&s;ion is unavoidable. The word of God is expre&s;s, that the &s;entence of the la&s;t judgment is given according to the go&s;pel, for tho&s;e things only which are done in the body. The go&s;pel has in plain words rejected the un|believer from &s;alvation. Some men die unbe|lievers. At this period they therefore mu&s;t be
<PB N="22" REF="020201_0021_0FAE3CFD7933FF48">
rejected by the judge; becau&s;e the go&s;pel has already rejected them, and judgment is only the execution of the go&s;pel &s;entence.</P>
<P>We have now arrived at the period of the general judgment. We have found that &s;ome men at this period have not fulfiled the condi|tions of life&mdash;that in con&s;equence they are, and mu&s;t be, rejected from Chri&s;t's &s;alvation by this judgment. It al&s;o appears that Chri&s;t's &s;alvation is <HI>eternal</HI>; that they therefore are re|jected from eternal &s;alvation by the la&s;t &s;en|tence of the judge; becau&s;e they have not ful|filed the conditions of life. The&s;e conditions then remain to be fulfiled after the general judgment, when the &s;entence of rejection from eternal life is pa&s;&s;ed, or they never can be fulfiled. But after the general judgment there will be no go&s;|pel conditions; therefore there can be none to fulfil. Judgment is the la&s;t act of go&s;pel. It is to fix the condition of tho&s;e who have been tryed by the go&s;pel&mdash;to reward its friends and puni&s;h its enemies. It is to put all things in &s;ubjection to Chri&s;t. And when this is done, go&s;pel has accompli&s;hed its whole de&s;ign, and mu&s;t cea&s;e.</P>
<P>As judgment is the execution of go&s;pel pro|mi&s;es and threatnings, it cannot take place till the end of the di&s;pen&s;ation. It is not time to reward or puni&s;h men by go&s;pel, till they have been fir&s;t proved by it. Therefore the judg|ment of the la&s;t day cannot commence, till
<PB N="23" REF="020201_0022_0FAE3CFE2556A3B8">
all tho&s;e have &s;tood their trial by go&s;pel, whom the wi&s;om of God hath decreed to try by it. fir&s;t to inflict go&s;pel puni&s;hments upon men, and after this to put them under tryal by the go&s;pel, would be like puni&s;hing a man for a breach of law which was never given him; and after this putting him under the law, to try if his future di&s;obedience would not merit the unju&s;t &s;entence already executed upon him:</P>
<P>In the nature of the thing, we mu&s;t begin with probation, and end with judgment, and thus God has repre&s;ented the judgment of the great day. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. 13th, 49th.</NOTE>So &s;hall it be in the <HI>end of the world,</HI> &s;aith Chri&s;t; <HI>the Angels &s;hall come forth, and &s;ever the wicked from among the ju&s;t.</HI> In the parable of the tares of the field, our ble&s;&s;ed Lord being the interpreter, the harve&s;t, or judgment, is the <HI>end of the world:</HI> And the repre&s;entation is, that as the reapers do not be|gin harve&s;t till the corn is fully ripe; &s;o judg|ment &s;hall not commence till all the &s;ubjects of it have fini&s;h'd their probation, and are ripe for the award.

conclu&s;ion of the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation. "The la&s;t enemy to be de&s;troyed is death:" And this enemy is de&s;troyed by the re&s;urrection: Judg|ment follows, and puts all enemies under Chri&s;t's feet. Devils and wicked men receive their fi|nal doom. And then the apo&s;tle &s;aith, the end cometh: then Chri&s;t will deliver up his kingdom, as mediator, into the hands of the father. The <HI>&s;econd death</HI> is not the la&s;t enemy here intended. The &s;econd death mu&s;t be de|&s;troyed before the final judgment, or never&mdash; It mu&s;t be de&s;troyed by the effect the go&s;pel has upon our lives. If we believe, it has no power over us. If we believe not, we &s;hall be hurt of the &s;econd death. For thus &s;aith God, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. 21, 7, 8.</NOTE><HI>He that overcometh &s;hall inherit all things, and I will be his God, and he &s;hall be my &s;on: But the fearful and unbelieving, and the abominable murderers, &amp;c. &s;hall have their part in the Lake which burneth with fire and brim&s;tone, which is the &s;econd death.</HI></P>
<P>Rea&s;on and revelation unitedly declare, that judgment is the la&s;t act of go&s;pel, the conclu|ding &s;cene of the di&s;pen&s;ation. When the go&s;|pel cea&s;es, the conditions of it mu&s;t cea&s;e. Judgment &s;huts up the go&s;pel: It therefore mu&s;t &s;hut up the conditions of the go&s;pel. Faith is a condition or law of the go&s;pel. Judg|ment clo&s;es the go&s;pel. After judgment there|fore, faith is not rewardable by the go&s;pel, be|cau&s;e it is not required by it.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="020201_0024_0FAE3D031DEF77A8">The &s;um of all is, that there can be no pro|bation under the go&s;pel after the general judg|ment, becau&s;e go&s;pel it&s;elf is then at an end, and cea&s;es to command. Between death and judgment nothing can be done to alter our &s;tate. Nothing can be done for which we are to be judged; for judgment only takes cogni|&s;ance of the things done in the body. It fol|lows, that if we ever fulfil the conditions of the go&s;pel, it mu&s;t be in this life, while we are in the body. We have adduced &s;everal in&s;tances, which prove inconte&s;tably that &s;ome men do not fulfil the&s;e conditions in this life, and as they cannot be fulfiled after death or judg|ment, it mu&s;t follow, that &s;ome men, at the final judgment, mu&s;t have the &s;entence of re|jection executed upon them; and that they be|ing filthy mu&s;t remain filthy, and the wrath of God abide upon them. Where then is <HI>uni|ver&s;al &s;alvation?</HI> It is not found in the go&s;pel, the la&s;t act of which excludes &s;ome men for|ever from a po&s;&s;ibility of it.</P>
<P>We will an&s;wer a few <HI>objections,</HI> and clo&s;e the &s;ubject&punc;</P>
<P>The fir&s;t objection is, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t has paid the <HI>whole debt</HI> which we had contracted by &s;in; and that ju&s;tice cannot demand a &s;econd payment.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t has indeed ran&s;omed us from the pe|nalty of the law of innocence. He has paid the whole debt to this law, and redeemed us
<PB N="26" REF="020201_0025_0FAE3D050BAAA220">
from the cur&s;e of it. If we are condemned therefore, it will be by another law. Chri&s;t has redeemed us from the <HI>Law</HI>; but has he redeemed us from the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> too? If we are under no obligation to the law, who dare &s;ay we are under none to the go&s;pel? The go&s;pel was given to us: But why was this done, if we are under no obligation to obey it? Tho' the law has been fulfiled, Chri&s;t who did ful|fil it, has placed us under the go&s;pel which is not fulfiled, and has threatened to exclude us from his &s;alvation, if we do not comply with the conditions of it. If we are finally condemned then, it will be by the go&s;pel, from the laws of which Je&s;us Chri&s;t has never excu&s;ed us. Our Lord could neither believe nor repent. Inno|cency foreclo&s;ed him from repentance; and infinite knowledge from faith:&mdash;The&s;e two are the leading terms of the go&s;pel,&mdash;Terms adapt|ed only to &s;inners, and beings of limited know|ledge&mdash;which can be fulfiled only by &s;uch be|ings;&mdash;and as they are required of us, will remain a debt upon us till we comply with them; and if we do not comply, we may be condemned by the go&s;pel, without the charge of a &s;econd payment.</P>
<P>The next objection is, that puni&s;hment is a <HI>medicine,</HI> de&s;igned by God for the cure of offence; and that it will have its effect either in this, or in &s;ome future trial. We grant, the puni&s;hments of this life are de&s;igned to
<PB N="27" REF="020201_0026_0FAE3D05D1FBD220">
purge from offence; but that this is the ca&s;e with the puni&s;hments of the future &s;tate, is not a doctrine of the go&s;pel. In the book of God, the puni&s;hments of the future judgment are uniformly repre&s;ented, not as the <HI>cure,</HI> but the <HI>award</HI>&mdash;the proper wages and de&s;ert of &s;in, as a judicial recompence which the ju&s;tice of God is concerned to execute upon the offender. Thus the apo&s;tle <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 6, 23d.</NOTE>"The <HI>wages</HI> of &s;in is death." And in the la&s;t day Chri&s;t is to appear <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">2d The&s;&s;. 1, 8, 9.</NOTE><HI>in fla|ming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the go&s;pel of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t: who &s;hall be puni&s;hed with ever|la&s;ting de&s;truction from the pre&s;ence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.</HI></P>
<P>Should it be &s;aid, God is not a Being of <HI>pa&s;|&s;ion:</HI> The reply is, he is a Being of <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> however; and has told us, if his mercy does not reclaim us, his vengeance or his ju&s;tice &s;hall pur&s;ue us; that there &s;hall be no remedy or e&s;caping.</P>
<P>As the po&s;ition, that future puni&s;hment is purgative, is un&s;criptural: &s;o the hope of a <HI>&s;econd trial</HI> under go&s;pel is merely vi&s;&s;ionary and ideal. For it has been proved, that after judgment there can be no trial, becau&s;e go&s;pel is then clo&s;ed. Indeed, that after the &s;epara|ration of &s;oul and body there can be none&mdash;for judgment takes cogni&s;ance only of the things done in the body. It therefore follows, that this life is the only time of probation under the go&s;pel,
<PB N="28" REF="020201_0027_0FAE3D067986AF40">
and that NOW only <HI>is the accepted time and day of &s;alvation,</HI> agreeably to the expre&s;s words of &s;cripture.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, it is objected, that we are <HI>finite</HI> be|ings; our crimes therefore mu&s;t be finite; but the puni&s;hment of them is repre&s;ented to be <HI>infinite,</HI> and mu&s;t exceed the weight of the offence. No being knows the weight of of|fence &s;o perfectly, as <HI>he</HI> who has adju&s;ted the puni&s;hment to it: This being hath declared that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke 12, 47, 48th.</NOTE><HI>that &s;ervant which knew his Lord's will, and prepared not him&s;elf, neither did according to his will, &s;hall be beaten with many &s;tripes&mdash;but he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of &s;tripes, &s;hall be beaten with few &s;tripes, for unto whom&s;oever much is given, of him &s;hall be much required.</HI>&mdash;<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matt. 25, 28, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">9, 30th.</NOTE> <HI>Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents, For unto every one that hath &s;hall be given, and he &s;hall have abundance; but from him that hath not &s;hall be taken away, even that which he hath. And ca&s;t ye the unprofitable &s;ervant into outer dark|ne&s;s: there &s;hall be weeping and gna&s;hing of teeth.</HI> If the offender remains an offender forever, it is as ju&s;t to continue his puni&s;hment, as it was at fir&s;t to inflict it. Whether any &s;hall conti|nue offenders forever is then the que&s;tion.&mdash; Were men machines, the puni&s;hment God in|flicts in this life, would infallibly reclaim the vicious. But as we are agents, the conclu&s;ion will not follow. The puni&s;hments inflicted upon Pharaoh were by infinite wi&s;dom adapted
<PB N="29" REF="020201_0028_0FAE3D07337B4A70">
to the cure of his proud and &s;tubborn heart; they did however prove ineffectual. Experience teaches, and the word of God declares, that the longer habits of vice are continued, the more inflexible they grow. The truth is, all men are not reclaimed in this world, either by human or divine puni&s;hments. Every man mu&s;t be reclaimed in the time of his trial, or never. It has been proved, that this life is the only time of trial: for judgment takes cogni&s;ance of the things only which are done in this life: and after judgment there can be no time of trial under go&s;pel: for the go&s;pel it&s;elf is then clo&s;ed. It follows then, that &s;ome men are not reclaimed by go&s;pel in the only time of trial under it, and therefore mu&s;t forever remain offenders again&s;t it. And &s;urely it is as ju&s;t to <HI>continue</HI> as to <HI>begin</HI> to puni&s;h an offender. It has been proved that judgment is the la&s;t act of go&s;pel. As men mu&s;t be fir&s;t tried, before they can be judged by go&s;pel, they who plead for a time of probation after judgment, plead for a thing clearly impo&s;&s;ible under the go&s;pel: becau&s;e at this period, there will be no go&s;pel to prove us.</P>
<P>If the&s;e future trials are &s;uppo&s;ed to be un|der &s;ome future di&s;pen&s;ation of grace, the go&s;|pel knows nothing of them: nor will I con|cern my&s;elf further with the hypothe&s;is than to ob&s;erve, that though it may be ingenious, it hath nothing but conjecture to &s;upport it. To &s;uppo&s;e go&s;pel has told us of &s;uch future
<PB N="30" REF="020201_0029_0FAE3D0801694848">
trials, is to &s;uppo&s;e it militates again&s;t it&s;elf, and has rendered its own motives feeble. They therefore who build their hopes of happine&s;s upon &s;uch conjectures, are <HI>removed from the hope of the go&s;pel,</HI> and place their expectations only in <HI>cunningly devi&s;ed fables,</HI> built upon mere dream and enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>It has been proved, that we are probationers, that faith and repentance are conditions of the go&s;pel&mdash;that our redeemer and judge has ex|cluded us from his &s;alvation, if we refu&s;e to comply with them&mdash;that judgment mu&s;t pro|ceed according to the conditions of the go&s;pel, that all men do not, in this life fulfil the&s;e conditions&mdash;that after death they cannot be ful|filed, till go&s;pel is finally clo&s;ed&mdash;audit there|fore follows, that all men &s;hall not be finally &s;aved by go&s;pel,</P>
<P>After the mo&s;t critical examination, in the fear of God, I &s;incerely believe the&s;e conclu&s;i|ons are fairly drawn from undoubted princi|ples, if the cleare&s;t and mo&s;t po&s;itive declara|tions of God's word are granted to be un|doubted principles. And indeed the capital arguments are founded upon the expre&s;s decla|rations of our ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer and judge. Can it be denied, that our Redeemer has re|jected the unbeliever from his &s;alvation? as judgment takes cogni&s;ance only of the things done in the body. Can it be denied that judg|ment mu&s;t execute the above &s;entence of the
<PB N="31" REF="020201_0030_0FAE3D08AC856E30">
Redeemer upon all who die in unbelief? Can it be denied that we are bound to obey the con|ditions of the go&s;pel, though Chri&s;t has an|&s;wered the demands of the law of innocence? Can it be denied that judgment is the la&s;t act of go&s;pel, as it is de&s;igned only to reward or puni&s;h tho&s;e who have had their trial under it? Can it then be denied that after judgment all probation under go&s;pel mu&s;t be at an end? Can it be denied that judgment takes cogni|&s;ance of the things only which are done in the body, and executes &s;entence according to the conditions of the go&s;pel? And can it be denied that Dives and others have died de&s;titute of the conditions of life? But if there is one per&s;on rejected from &s;alvation by the go&s;pel, there may be more, and mu&s;t be as many as die in impenitence and unbelief. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Perhaps it may be objected, that the in&s;tance of Dives is a parable, and therefore improperly adduc'd.&mdash;But the circum&s;tance of its being a parable adds weight to the argument<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">: for though D<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ves and Lazarus are mentioned as particular per&s;ons, they are de&s;igned to repre&s;ent different characters; and it is clear from the context that Lazarus repre&s;ents all who obey the go&s;pel, and Dives all who di&s;obey it.&mdash;therefore the declaration is, that all they who o|bey the go&s;pel, do find them&s;elves at death in a place of joy and comfort; and all who di&s;obey it, feel them &s;elves in a place of mi&s;ery and di&s;tre&s;s, nor will it do to &s;ay there will be no &s;uch different characters at this period, for this would be to deny there was a foundation for the parable it&s;elf.</NOTE>One in&s;tance at lea&s;t has been adduced. <HI>Univer&s;al Salvation</HI> mu&s;t therefore be rejected.</P>
<P>From the above rea&s;ons it appears, that the ancient doctrine of the Church of God is the true doctrine&mdash;that the doctrine we have op|po&s;ed is de&s;titute of go&s;pel &s;upport&mdash;and that faith and repentance are conditions of the

go&s;pel which we mu&s;t fulfil, or be rejected from the hope of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>As the doctrine I have here attempted to maintain, is (at lea&s;t in my own judgment) founded in truth, and &s;upported by the word of truth; but has lately, however, been warm|ly oppo&s;ed by &s;ome, I &s;hall publi&s;h the argu|ments adduced in &s;upport of the ancient doc|trines of the Church, and leave the world to judge of the validity of them.

I believe the doctrine op|po&s;ed in this Di&s;cour&s;e to be contrary to God's holy and eternal truth, and &s;ubver&s;ive of the great de&s;ign of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t; and how can I bid you a final adieu, while I fear any of you, by imbibing this doctrine, may be <HI>re|moved from the hope of the go&s;pel.</HI> I am clear in it, that faith and repentence are nece&s;&s;ary to

go&s;pel &s;alvation. Imbibe this doctrine, both in theory and practice, and then I have autho|rity in the name of my ble&s;&s;ed ma&s;ter, <HI>who&s;e I am, and whom I &s;erve,</HI> to promi&s;e you com|pleat and endle&s;s happine&s;s. But as I expect &s;alvation upon no other terms my&s;elf, I dare not encourage you to hope for it in any other way.</P>
<P>This, probably, is the la&s;t time we &s;hall meet in a united a&s;&s;embly, till we meet before the awful tribunal of the final Judge. Let us then examine for truth with &s;uch care and im|partiality, that we all may be rooted and grounded in the faith and order of the go&s;pel, that when we meet again, we may adore God, and congratulate one another, in the ble&s;&s;ed victory and triumph we have by the blood of Chri&s;t gained through faith.</P>
<P>How happy, happy &s;hould I be, my bre|thren, at that important hour, could I with a&s;&s;urance, &s;ay to my infinite Judge, "Lo, here am I, and the &s;piritual children thou ha&s;t given me! Here is my whole flock; <HI>they have wa&s;hed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the lamb: therefore are they before the throne of God, and &s;tand ready to &s;erve him day and night in his temple.</HI>" That this may be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">or happy lot, let the clear &s;en&s;e, the mo&s;t expre&s;s decla|rations of God's word, regulate your faith. Examine candidly for truth, and imbrace it when fairly found. In this way, we may

"all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the &s;on of God, unto a per|fect man;" and be builded together, "upon the foundation of the apo&s;tles and prophets, Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf being the chief corner &s;tone."</P>
<P>Should we meet once again upon this ble&s;&s;ed foundation, our joy mu&s;t be full. In hope of this happy event, with the mo&s;t affectionate entreaty to you to &s;tand with your <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ps burning, and earne&s;t prayer to God to prepare you for glory, by a &s;teady belief of the go&s;pel, and a faithful obedience to it, I now deliver up my charge of your &s;pirital concerns&mdash;beg|ging that God, who cau&s;es men to be of one mind in an hou&s;e, to <HI>grant you to be like mind|ed, that you may with one mind and one mouth glorify God</HI>&mdash;may be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the faith of the go&s;pel&mdash;and enabled to <HI>grow up into</HI> HIM <HI>in all things who is the Head, even Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>"Finally then, my Brethren, Farewell: be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace, and the God of Love and Peace &s;hall be with you"&mdash;&s;hall "make you perfect to do his will, and pre&s;ent you faultle&s;s before his pre&s;ence with exceeding and eternal joy." Which God Almighty grant may be the hap|py portion of us all, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
