<Q>Render therefore to all their dues: tribute, to whom tribute is due; cu&s;tom, to whom cu&s;tom; fear, to whom fear; honor to whom honor. Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law. For this, Thou &s;halt not commit adultery, Thou &s;halt not kill, Thou &s;halt not &s;teal, Thou &s;halt not bear fal&s;e witne&s;s, Thou &s;halt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this &s;aying, namely, Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf.</Q>

<P>THIS pa&s;&s;age, which is a &s;ummary of the laws of Religion, may al&s;o be con&s;idered as a &s;ummary of tho&s;e political and &s;ocial du|ties, by which a nation is made happy. The chapter in connection is the be&s;t political di&s;|&s;ertation that was ever penned. Without en|tering into a compari&s;on of the &s;everal kinds
<PB N="6" REF="022913_0005_0FBAB81B16554130">
of government, which men have erected, the writer confines him&s;elf to general truths and duties, which are nece&s;&s;ary in all of them, are founded in the nature of &s;ociety, and approved by rea&s;on and experience.</P>
<P>HE begins the chapter with a&s;&s;erting the di|vine origin of civil government. <HI>The powers that be are ordained of God, whoever re&s;i&s;teth the power re&s;i&s;teth the ordinance of God.</HI> Infinite wi&s;dom &s;uffers us to chu&s;e our own form of government, and de&s;ignate the in&s;truments by whom it &s;hall be executed; but the ordinance is &s;till the LORD'S, and to refu&s;e obedience is &s;inning again&s;t heaven.&mdash;Nor hath any man a right to complain, as the in&s;titution was de|&s;igned for human good, and there is an ea&s;y way of reconciling our own intere&s;t with all the powers of a well regulated government. <HI>For rulers are not a terror to good works but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power?</HI> do&s;t thou de&s;ire it to be a ble&s;&s;ing and not an evil to thee? <HI>do that which is good and thou &s;halt have prai&s;e of the &s;ame. For he is the mini&s;ter of God to thee for good. Wherefore ye mu&s;t needs be &s;ubject, not only for wrath but con&s;cience &s;ake.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER a&s;&s;erting the divine origin and the nece&s;&s;ity of civil government, in &s;ome of the kinds practi&s;ed by men; the Apo&s;tle recapitu|lates, in our text, the principal duties by which &s;ociety is united, protected and made happy, and &s;ums up his de&s;cription in the&s;e words, <HI>And if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this &s;aying thou &s;halt love thy neigh|bour
<PB N="7" REF="022913_0006_0FBAB81D62A8B9F8">
as thy&s;elf.</HI>&mdash;If there be any political duty, not otherwi&s;e expre&s;sly commanded, we may find it in the great law of chri&s;tian love; this law directs rulers and &s;ubjects in every po&s;&s;ible connection, and will make them faithful in their re&s;pective places. On reviewing the con|nection of the chapter, it appears that the Apo&s;|tle de&s;igned our text, as a collection of political maxims, by which &s;ociety may be pre&s;erved, and the great end of government be promoted under whatever form or con&s;titution it &s;ub&s;i&s;ts: and on further attending to the &s;ame maxims, we find they are the e&s;&s;ential laws of religion, which were early given to men as a rule of du|ty, and their pre&s;ent and future well being. I think this is a clear proof, that religion and a well regulated civil government are &s;ubjects which cannot be &s;eperated. A good ruler or a good &s;ubject will not &s;uffer the&s;e laws to go out of his view. Happine&s;s is the great end de&s;igned by all &s;ocial in&s;titutions; for this, the laws and duties of religion are enjoined on crea|tures by the wi&s;dom of their maker; for the &s;ame end men have organized government, and defined its powers and duties; both have rela|tion to the &s;ocial capacities and enjoyments of connected minds, and aiming at the &s;ame end, mu&s;t in a con&s;iderable degree procure it by the &s;ame means. So far as religion and govern|ment deviate from each other, one or the other of them deviates from the nature of men, and the effects of their &s;ocial relation.</P>
<P>HAPPINESS cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without love and ju&s;tice, between tho&s;e who are brought into
<PB N="8" REF="022913_0007_0FBAB820AD327328">
connection by the &s;upreme providence. The ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of a perfect world, and the perfec|tion of divine government, are repre&s;ented to us by the abundance of the&s;e virtues. We have no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that &s;y&s;tems of virtue or law, e&s;&s;entially different, are nece&s;&s;ary for the good government of the heavenly and earthly &s;ocieties; as they both aim at the &s;ame thing, the happine&s;s of rational minds in union with each other. There is not an idea, in the world, more dangerous to &s;ociety, or more deba&s;ing to civil government, than this, that it &s;tands on a ba&s;is of human wi&s;dom and will, apart from tho&s;e great religious obligations, which direct the manner and duties of intercour&s;e in all worlds.</P>
<P>RELIGION, or love, holine&s;s and righteou&s;|ne&s;s, the names by which it is commonly called in the &s;acred oracles, is the con&s;titution and law of the &s;upreme government, by which the Almighty is glorified, and his creatures connec|ted in ble&s;&s;edne&s;s; and the nature of intelligent beings admits not a &s;afe introduction of other principles; depart from the&s;e and we act no longer like rea&s;onable men or like chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>OUR apprehen&s;ions of a perfect and glorious &s;ociety mu&s;t be defective, as we have not the aid of experience; but in accounting to our|&s;elves for the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s and &s;tability of its or|ders, we always conceive the perfect exerci&s;e of religion, as a cau&s;e &s;ufficient for the effect. If the laws of religion are &s;ufficient to render the divine government mo&s;t glorious and happy;
<PB N="9" REF="022913_0008_0FBAB821B8432AF0">
and if the practice of religion will give a future perfection to the heavenly life, why are not the &s;ame principles and practice, the &s;trength and &s;afety of men's government in this world. The LORD our GOD governs according to the na|ture of things, and his admini&s;tration always ends well; and are not men, when they act for him in the temporary authorities of the world, mo&s;t like to &s;ucceed, to &s;upport their own dig|nity, and be a ble&s;&s;ing to others, when they adopt in their admini&s;tration and act from the &s;ame principle.</P>
<P>A RULER needs religion much more than his unofficered brethren, to &s;upport his mind under trials, and to guard him again&s;t temptations. When the re&s;pectable citizen ri&s;es from private into public life, he mu&s;t expect to exchange quietne&s;s for trouble; honor, though alluring, has its bitterne&s;s and its dangers; enemies be|fore unknown, will ri&s;e up; the jealous will &s;ift all his actions, and what man can be &s;o guarded as to have all his behaviour e&s;cape cen|&s;ure? The ambitious, thinking him in the way of their own progre&s;s, will be his enemies. To &s;upport the mind under the&s;e evils, and lead it into the exerci&s;e of prudence and patience, re|ligion is nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>To hold great power and places of confiden|tial tru&s;t is a &s;tate of temptation, which every man cannot re&s;i&s;t, and tho&s;e who are wi&s;e will not accept a call to public &s;ervice, until by examination, they find in their hearts fixed principles of fidelity. A bad man may &s;eek elevation, but it is only a good man who can
<PB N="10" REF="022913_0009_0FBAB823C7A1CBE0">
bear it; many &s;hine in adver&s;ity, which cools the appetites and un&s;ocial pa&s;&s;ions; but to &s;hine in pro&s;perity; to be humane and ju&s;t in the circle of a court; to be true and honora|ble in the treatment of all mankind; to be righteous and hone&s;t when power gives oppor|tunity for oppre&s;&s;ing, the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of fixed re|ligious principles are certainly nece&s;&s;ary. If religion be nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in the common duties of life, it is more nece&s;&s;ary where duties are multiplied and enlarge.</P>
<P>POLITICAL elevation is generally e&s;teemed honorable, but it is not always attended with honor, for this depends not on the elevation it&s;elf, but on the principles and conduct of the per&s;on who is rai&s;ed. What is true honor but the e&s;|teem and love of mankind on virtuous rea&s;ons? He who renders to all their dues&mdash;who pre&s;erves him&s;elf from a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of GOD' laws, by injuring the purity, intere&s;t or reputation of others, and performs the political and brotherly duties enjoined in the command&mdash;thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf; he hath an hon|or which enemies cannot long &s;tain, nor time wipe away. But a profu&s;ion of knowledge, and the glare of great abilities, without fixed princi|ples of love to GOD and men, are like a &s;ong, the &s;ounds die away and the plea&s;ing &s;urprize of the mind departs.</P>
<P>HAVING made the&s;e general remarks on the u&s;efulne&s;s of religion in civil &s;ociety, and in the character of one who rules men; that we may &s;ee its efficacy in the cleare&s;t manner, let us more accurately trace its nature and effects in the mind.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="022913_0010_0FBAB824EED77480">WE are now to con&s;ider the formation of a character, which will be uniformly &s;upported thro life, and where a &s;teady practice evidences &s;ome habitual di&s;po&s;itions, that cannot be &s;ub|verted by every &s;light temptation.</P>
<P>THE great end of political a&s;&s;ociations is be&s;t an&s;wered where there is the mo&s;t perfect union, and tho&s;e principles are mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential to go|vernment, which have the greate&s;t tendency to produce union. The intere&s;ts of individuals, are by the emergencies of time thrown into many &s;ituations. We live with many others who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions are complicated, various and pointed to their own per&s;onal ends. Every le&s;|&s;er di&s;trict, every family, and individual in the family, hath intere&s;ts of its own. If the&s;e pri|vate intere&s;ts have a &s;upreme influence the ut|mo&s;t evils will en&s;ue. It is the bu&s;ine&s;s of government to hold the balance between them, to check the overbearing and point them to a common good, and for this it needs the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome pervading &s;ocial bond, and this bond can be no other than religion.</P>
<P>BUT few minds are &s;o enlightened in the in|&s;titution of nature and the &s;upreme wi&s;dom which formed it, as to &s;ee that a pur&s;uit of the general good will be an eventual advancement of each man's private good; and where there is this enlarged under&s;tanding if the heart be corrupt, the pa&s;&s;ions will rebel.</P>
<P>IN all rational &s;ociety there needs &s;ome cementing principle of the heart, by which
<PB N="12" REF="022913_0011_0FBAB8263832F680">
the minds who compo&s;e it may be united, have one intere&s;t, one common good, and one happine&s;s.</P>
<P>MANY philo&s;ophers, and politicians of renown in their times, have enquired for this bond of union without &s;ucce&s;s, and &s;educed by their own rea&s;oning, have &s;ub&s;tituted art, corruption or power.</P>
<P>CHRISTIAN love in its comprehen&s;ion of vir|tues, is the &s;upreme tie of &s;ocial connexion. This is the &s;ame as the Apo&s;tle means, when he &s;ays&mdash;<HI>owe no man any thing, but to love one another&mdash;and if there be any other command, it is briefly comprehended in this &s;aying, thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf.</HI>&mdash;He that loveth his neigh|bour hath fulfilled the law; he will exerci&s;e all the varieties of love as they are modified in the actions of ju&s;tice, truth, integrity and benefi|cence; he will render to all their dues, tribute to whom tribute is due, cu&s;tom to whom cu&s;|tom, fear to whom fear, and honor to whom honor; he will reverence the property, peace and reputation of all mankind; and by his di|vine love he will be made happy in doing good to others.&mdash;Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy &s;trength and with all thy mind, and thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf, are the two greate&s;t laws of an enlightened policy, in every community of rea&s;onable creatures; this is religion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> heart, and the vi&s;ible practice of it is that reli|gion in life, by which a man becomes a good ruler, or a good &s;ubject, according as GOD is plea&s;ed to place him. The&s;e fir&s;t laws of reli|gion
<PB N="13" REF="022913_0012_0FBAB82935F35B08">
are as excellent for earth as for Heaven; and as good a directory in civil admini&s;tration, as in chri&s;tian living.</P>
<P>I WOULD not be under&s;tood that the holy &s;criptures are a code of civil law, nor that they &s;uperceed its nece&s;&s;ity, nor that the religion of CHRIST determines the mo&s;t proper con&s;tituti|on of nations. The divine law and go&s;pel have in view a more comprehen&s;ive object, the gov|ernment, the glory and happine&s;s of the creati|on; &s;till they embrace tho&s;e moral and religi|ous principles, in all their varieties, on which the happine&s;s and &s;tability of le&s;&s;er &s;ocieties mu&s;t depend.&mdash;Public peace is the fruit of uni|on&mdash;union is the re&s;ult of chri&s;tian love and re|ligion. When every man regards the welfare of his brother and of the whole, the political bo|dy is &s;trong, full of energy and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>THESE are the mo&s;t permanent and &s;afe prin|ciples on which &s;ociety can be organized, and all others are liable to an ea&s;y di&s;&s;olution. Pow|er <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> con&s;train a kind of order in the &s;tate, but its very appearance is gloomy, and it is de&s;titute of happine&s;s. Fear which awes cannot &s;weeten the heart and feelings of mankind; the &s;ubject compelled to quietne&s;s by a dread of &s;everity, at the &s;ame moment wi&s;hes revolt, and the plea&s;ant amities of living are all denied.&mdash;The &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ions may be variou&s;ly addre&s;&s;ed, and a &s;y&s;tem of human art con&s;tructed; But to how many ca&s;ualties it is &s;ubject and how often annihilated in a moment, the hi&s;tory of empires is full of witne&s;s. Ju&s;tice, truth, righteou&s;ne&s;s and mer|cy are the &s;olid ba&s;is of empire, and the&s;e are
<PB N="14" REF="022913_0013_0FBAB82B15BF6DB8">
but branches of religion or chri&s;tian love. To the&s;e permanent principles of &s;ociety nothing may be oppo&s;ed, and the nece&s;&s;ity which men &s;ometimes urge is but a delu&s;ion. All the vir|tues of a pious and good life, ought to be the object of national encouragement. The&s;e re|concile the heart of the &s;ubject to the welfare of the whole and of his brethren. They make a ruler the friend and father of his country; and might the heart of every citizen be in&s;pir|ed with the&s;e principles, the art and exerci&s;e of government would become extremely &s;im|ple, and each one would be influenced by his feelings, to act in the &s;phere of his duty. Co|ercion or an artful addre&s;s to the pa&s;&s;ions of different orders of men would fall into di&s;u&s;e, for it is only thro human degeneracy, that the&s;e &s;ub&s;idiary aids can produce any benefit.</P>
<P>I AM &s;en&s;ible that human nature mu&s;t be taken by the civil governor as he finds it, and that there is not in the world a &s;ufficiency of true religion to effect &s;o happy a &s;tate as is de|&s;cribed; but &s;till he ought not to let the&s;e great principles of &s;ociety go out of view, and if he doth, will certainly injure the public.</P>
<P>IT is not uncommon for &s;ome, on ob&s;erving men's corruption, to embrace dangerous opin|ions on this &s;ubject. Aiming at a wi&s;e and deep policy, they &s;ub&s;titute collu&s;ion, intrigue, and an artful addre&s;s to the pa&s;&s;ions and inter|e&s;ts of parties, in the place of love, ju&s;tice and truth. They in&s;inuate that religion and its in|&s;titutions have nothing to do with government and civil policy, and that the moral obligations
<PB N="15" REF="022913_0014_0FBAB82E40DA8950">
which may be a fit &s;ubject for the exhortation of a clergyman, cannot be very &s;tricly con&s;ulted by tho&s;e who manage the civil intere&s;ts of man|kind. When any collection of people are &s;o corrupt, that they will not bear reproof and the corrective re&s;traint of government, that peo|ple ought, to be di&s;banded and feel the correc|tion of their own vices; and that which ought to be done the natural operation of things will &s;peedily effect. Such repre&s;entations as I ju&s;t mentioned, may &s;ometimes proceed wholly from corruption of heart; an ambitious man, who knows him&s;elf de&s;titute of religious prin|ciples, mu&s;t be unwilling to have their u&s;eful|ne&s;s in &s;ociety generally acknowledged; but very often I believe they proceed from an igno|rance of human nature, and the nature of &s;o|ciety. Tho the arts of corruption may &s;uc|ceed with a man for a few times, a lo&s;s of pub|lic confidence will put it out of his power to repeat them often. Let him that ruleth over men be ju&s;t; ruling in the fear of the LORD, is a law of perpetual u&s;efulne&s;s, and derives its fitne&s;s from the nature of &s;ociety indeed reli|gion is the be&s;t bond of &s;ociety, and being &s;uch is the be&s;t &s;upport of government.</P>
<P>THO a di&s;tinction is made in the &s;tate, be|tween the civil and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical departments, neither of them is independent of the other. Civility and the good order of political regu|lations are a great advantage to religion; reli|gion and its in&s;titutions are the be&s;t aid of government, by &s;trengthening the ruler's hand, and making the &s;ubject faithful in his place, and obedient to the general laws.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="022913_0015_0FBAB82F38C4F968">THO the author of our holy religion a&s;&s;umed no temporal authority, and gave no opinion on the &s;everal kinds of government, or the tem|poral juri&s;dictions of men; yet he e&s;tabli&s;hed as fir&s;t principles in his church, tho&s;e laws which are e&s;&s;ential to the peace of every &s;tate; on which every kind of authority mu&s;t &s;tand, which can be a ble&s;&s;ing to the people; or which nerve the hand of government and pro|tect the liberties of mankind. Hence we find that wherever a ju&s;t under&s;tanding of chri&s;ti|anity hath obtained, and its duties been prac|ti&s;ed, they have had a benign influence on the liberty of nations: And where a contrary ef|fect hath been aided by what men called reli|gion, as was the ca&s;e in the Papal Hierarchy, it was owing to a &s;ubver&s;ion of the true prin|ciples of chri&s;tianity. A &s;purious &s;uper&s;truc|ture was rai&s;ed by the corruption of men, fal&s;ely called by the name of religion, and not calculated to refine either the affections or prac|tice of the people, but to aid a &s;ecular power by terrifying men, while tho&s;e who were fir&s;t in church and &s;tate &s;hared their &s;poils.</P>
<P>THE religion of JESUS, with no weapons in its hand but tho&s;e of truth and love, &s;ilently &s;ubverts oppre&s;&s;ion; makes the people regular in di&s;charging their duties, and rulers upright and humane in their admini&s;tration; and there needs no other means to &s;ubvert the tyrannies of the world, than the univer&s;al &s;pread and practice of this religion.</P>
<P>WHEN as &s;ubjects, we find that religion a&s;|&s;i&s;ts, us in doing all enjoined duties, and re|conciles
<PB N="17" REF="022913_0016_0FBAB830CC07C5E0">
us to the intere&s;t of the public and our neighbours, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, that it will give equal a&s;&s;i&s;tance to tho&s;e whom GOD appointeth to be in authority over us; and that their man|ners ought to be adorned by obedience to the divine law. We feel &s;ure that religion will guard them again&s;t temptations&mdash;lead them to a &s;ound policy&mdash;to liberal feelings&mdash;to a pa|ternal regard of the people, and an unduanted &s;upport of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>IF there be not a mi&s;take in the&s;e leading propo&s;itions, the following important conclu|&s;ion mu&s;t be received; that without religion no &s;ociety whatever can long &s;ub&s;i&s;t in peace, or tho&s;e who are members of it have rea&s;on to re|joice in the connexion.</P>
<P>THE &s;upreme will commands religion, for its u&s;efulne&s;s to his connected creatures. He &s;aw that by this, the minds he created would become happy, and be joined in a communion, that makes the advantage of each one, matter of joy to the whole, and the dignity and per|fection of the whole, an object of delight to each individual. He &s;aw that thus the intelli|ligent kingdom would have one &s;pirit, one in|tere&s;t and one happine&s;s. On what other foundation can rational and u&s;eful union &s;ub|&s;i&s;t in this world? In both ca&s;es the &s;ubjects are the &s;ame and have the &s;ame powers, faculties and capacities. Do not tho&s;e per&s;ons there|fore act unnaturally, and again&s;t the laws of exi&s;tence, who attempt the e&s;tabli&s;hment of any &s;ociety on other principles be&s;ide tho&s;e of religion? are not their expectations of its per|manency

without rea&s;on? Have we not always found the &s;pirit of religion our be&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the duties and connexions of life? Have we not found our families happy, in the &s;ame pro|portion, as its &s;pirit and orders reigned in them? Or looking back on the civil &s;tate, can we recollect a &s;ingle in&s;tance of public inju&s;|tice, or the &s;emblance of it, or the extraordi|nary prevalence of any immorality, which was not followed with great evils? The law of GOD and nature can never be repealed.</P>
<P>THE conclu&s;ion extends it&s;elf &s;till further; Fir&s;t, that it is the right; and Secondly, that it is the duty of civil rulers to protect religion.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, it is their right. It is a plain maxim of rea&s;on, that the civil &s;tate is ve&s;ted with all ne|ce&s;&s;ary powers of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation. If it be lawful for mankind to combine in a political union, they have right to perpetuate the e&s;tab|li&s;hment; and as the pa&s;&s;ions of men are, there can be no comfortable living without &s;uch e&s;|tabli&s;hments. To deny civil government the right of protecting religion, and &s;uppre&s;&s;ing ir|religion, is denying it the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential means of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation. All kinds of vice militate again&s;t the &s;tate, and religion in the modifica|tion of its virtues are its &s;afe-guard. To or|ganize the civil &s;tate, and appoint a number of the people to be rulers; to commit the public to their charge and make them re&s;pon&s;ible for its well-being; and then to deny them the means and power of protecting and encouraging reli|gion, is a &s;evere requirement. If any man ac|cepts the charge, under this re&s;triction he pro|mi&s;es beyond human performance.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="022913_0018_0FBAB835EC280808">Secondly, IT is the duty of rulers to protect and encourage religion, and of the people to a&s;|&s;i&s;t them in doing it. The public weal is the mo&s;t &s;acred of all earthly betru&s;tments. Eve|ry man when called to office, hath an opportu|nity to refu&s;e this care, if he thinks him&s;elf in|capable, or finds that his heart is not hone&s;t enough to do it with fidelity; but when the tru&s;t is accepted, the obligations to a faithful performance are mo&s;t &s;acred. No light cau&s;es will execu&s;e either the civil, or religious mini&s;|ter of the public, for unfaithfulne&s;s in the du|ties of his office. The happine&s;s of an indivi|dual is dear, and the forfeit of it more bitter than can be de&s;cribed; how much more dear the aggregate happine&s;s of the public body? Entering into &s;ociety, we depo&s;it our property lives, friends and happine&s;s, in the hand of the public; the public recommit this tru&s;t to the care of rulers, and give them a right and pow|er to &s;ee it inviolably pre&s;erved. If religion and its in&s;titutions be the mo&s;t certain means to pre&s;erve, is it not their duty to protect and en|courage virtue and piety? Or can any man be called faithful in his appointment, who hath neglected to give this encouragement, both offi|cially and in the private example of his life? He hath had the vi&s;ible dignity, but with a con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of unfaithfulne&s;s, can he feel honor|able to him&s;elf, or be &s;o vain as to &s;uppo&s;e that he is re&s;pected in the hearts of the people? Un|der a conviction of the truth I have urged, can he look back upon him&s;elf with a peaceful con|&s;cience? The parent who hath been a fearer of the Lord, and a faithful &s;ubject and citizen, when he &s;ees his family corrupted by &s;uch irre|ligion
<PB N="20" REF="022913_0019_0FBAB836ED0859D0">
as the &s;tate ought to &s;uppre&s;s, hath rea&s;on to complain, that his expence and allegiance have not been repayed by that guardian care, which he had a right to expect from the civil power, which alone can &s;top the &s;ources and puni&s;h the in&s;truments of corruption.</P>
<P>MAY I be &s;uffered to &s;ugge&s;t another &s;erious truth. The government is the LORDS; men are the in&s;truments of providence in arranging its powers and duties, and appointing proper per|&s;ons to execute them; the government is &s;till the LORD'S. He commits his creatures to &s;uch of their brethren, as are &s;uppo&s;ed to have mo&s;t wi&s;|dom and di&s;creetne&s;s. The whole earthly &s;tate, is de&s;igned as a &s;chool of in&s;truction, and cor|rection to mature &s;uch virtues, as will make men perfectly happy in another life. This is one end of government, for we cannot di&s;connect time and eternity. This great people are placed in the hands of their rulers, by Almighty GOD their tender Father and Saviour. He &s;its &s;u|preme King and expects fidelity from all; every care and exertion that &s;uch religion be encourag|ed, as will &s;ecure pre&s;ent and eternal happine&s;s. Could we keep alive a &s;en&s;e of divine things, and the connexion between this and another world, the&s;e truths would make a deep impre&s;&s;|ion on all our hearts.</P>
<P>By commending religion to the protection of the &s;tate, and the practice of its leading charac|ters, I do not mean to urge an intolerant and per&s;ecuting &s;pirit, which is very different from a tender care of piety. Many differences of opinion in a land of Chri&s;tian light, are con|cerning
<PB N="21" REF="022913_0020_0FBAB8388F78E060">
the non-e&s;&s;entials and the ritual of re|ligion. Several of the&s;e matters, the great head of the Church when he was on earth, did not think proper to determine. Their propriety often depends on local or temporary circum|&s;tances, or on the particular con&s;truction and feelings of different minds. Such differences when con&s;cientiou&s;ly maintained, have not a dangerous effect either on the e&s;&s;entials of reli|gion, or good order of the &s;tate; and govern|ment may tolerate them with &s;afety. If we look thro the chri&s;tian &s;ectaries, who differ in ceremonies and words, candor will perceive, that the greate&s;t number of them unite, in the weighty matters of faith, piety, religion and ju&s;|tice, towards GOD and towards men. A diffu|&s;ion of knowledge is now advancing a liberal &s;pirit. May the Great Head of the Church ha&s;ten the period, when tho&s;e who think alike, concerning a divine love, ju&s;tice, faith and truth, may join their hands and hail a future meeting in Heaven, where ceremonies and modes of ex|pre&s;&s;ion will not &s;eparate, brethren. Experi|ence hath taught, that tolerancy in the&s;e things is the mo&s;t powerful means of union; and a con&s;cientious government will find little diffi|culty in determining when to encourage and coerce.</P>
<P>BUT while we &s;peak of a liberal &s;pirit, let not immorality and irreligion think they have a right to our tenderne&s;s. Liberality is a divine affection of the heart, a love of the truth and of men, and cannot be plea&s;ed with vice. True liberality is chri&s;tian love, and delights in GOD and in all the virtues he commandeth, and is
<PB N="22" REF="022913_0021_0FBAB83C23D92B78">
mo&s;t mi&s;taken by &s;uch per&s;ons, as triumph in vice over the &s;ocial obligations: If there be who &s;peak with lightne&s;s of a mo&s;t perfect and glo|rious providence; if there be, who think they may treat the religion of their brethren with lightne&s;s; if there be a few, either &s;o odd or weak in their way of thinking, as not to &s;ee in our &s;acred books, truths mo&s;t favorable to &s;ocie|ty, and a mo&s;t glorious de&s;cription of the Al|mighty, his ju&s;tice and goodne&s;s; if there be, who live wicked and immoral lives, they ought not to think it con&s;i&s;tent either with the digni|ty or &s;afety of the &s;tate to protect their &s;ins. A delirious man is to be pitied, but for his &s;ake a nation cannot change its in&s;titutions: An im|moral man is a &s;ubject of our forgivene&s;s and prayer as chri&s;tians, and of our neighbourly of|fices as citizens; but mu&s;t not expect, that the venerable public, with &s;uffer him to &s;port with the principles of their exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>OUR &s;ubject admits a variety of practical in|ferences, on which I may not enlarge. It in|&s;tructs us all how to be good citizens: Every man is a member in the political body; and every member hath a place in which it may be u&s;eful. If any are not u&s;eful, it is their fault; for divine wi&s;dom hath &s;o organized the body, there is a place, a bu&s;ine&s;s and a duty for all. The man who doth his duty, be his &s;ervice what it may, de&s;erves well of the &s;tate. No order, profe&s;&s;ion or employment, may &s;ay to another, there is no need of thee. All will do well if they re&s;pect the great principles of religion, if their hearts po&s;&s;e&s;s divine love, and their prac|tice be in obedience to the law of GOD; and
<PB N="23" REF="022913_0022_0FBAB83E2A2542C8">
without the&s;e a man's character will be defect|ive, whether he move in a high &s;phere, or hath a humble place in the &s;tate. Religion will make us contented with &s;uch place and em|ployment as providence appointeth, and autho|rize us to think of our&s;elves we are not u&s;ele&s;s. The want of religion, if it doth not make a per&s;on entirely u&s;ele&s;s, yet in a great mea&s;ure de&s;troys him to mankind; and our ri&s;ing admiration of his u&s;eful accompli&s;hments, di&s;&s;olves in tears of &s;orrow for degenerate human nature.</P>
<P>OUR &s;ubject reproves all tho&s;e vices injuri|ous to &s;ociety, and none is more &s;o than a par|ty &s;pirit. Partial affection for local di&s;tricts and their intere&s;ts, mu&s;t breed oppo&s;ition, and the general good will be forgotten in intere&s;ted altercation. But of all party intrigue, that is the mo&s;t open in&s;ult on the dignity of a free &s;tate, and mo&s;t threatening to its happine&s;s, when offices are bartered for emolument, and dignities divided by private influence. Such things religion forbids, and decency with a &s;igh turns her face from the &s;cene.</P>
<P>RELIGION forbids, and when it prevails a|mong a people will prevent, the cruel practice of privately &s;landering the reputation of eleva|ted characters. To wound in the dark is an ea&s;y thing, and a &s;mall capacity influenced by a bad heart can do it effectually. Unfounded jealou&s;ies, are as dangerous to the public as to tho&s;e who &s;uffer them, and by being often re|peated, &s;hake the foundation of government, and place the worthy and unworthy, on the &s;ame level of confidence in the minds of the people.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="022913_0023_0FBAB83F63F1D3F8">RELIGION is the be&s;t friend of men's liberties and properties. Undert his influence, govern|ment will be ju&s;t to all its engagements, and the intere&s;t of every citizen &s;tand &s;ecure, on the ba|&s;is of equity and ju&s;tice. Where the &s;pirit and practice of religion reigns, the &s;igh of op|pre&s;&s;ion will cea&s;e, and men no longer groan under the power of their brethren. A great part of the happine&s;s of the world, mu&s;t be at|tributed to the humane influence of the religi|on of JESUS, and the remainder of oppre&s;&s;ion is a witne&s;s how imperfectly his doctrines are un|der&s;tood, and how little there is of his &s;pirit, even in the countries which are called chri&s;tian. On the ground of prophetic a&s;&s;urance we expect a day, in which this religion &s;hall fill the earth, and when it happens, there will be no traffick in the bodies and &s;ouls of men; oppre&s;&s;ion and &s;la|very will cea&s;e and the image of the Creator in rea&s;on and under&s;tanding, will be allowed as evi|dence of a right to the privileges of his family.</P>
<P>OUR &s;ubject recommends to the rulers of the &s;tate, an encouragement of all tho&s;e in&s;titutions, by which religion and &s;cience are diffu&s;ed among the people. It is the manner of divine wi&s;dom, to work by means regularly e&s;tabli&s;h|ed. When the in&s;titutions of religion fall into di&s;repute, we have no right to expect, that the &s;pirit of piety will prevail among the people. The vi&s;ible orders of religion are an inclo&s;ure, which holds its friends together; and under an idea of tolerancy many have run into an oppo|&s;ite extreme of opinion, that in all ca&s;es where men pretend con&s;cience, they ought to be ex|empted from the direction of law. To argue
<PB N="25" REF="022913_0024_0FBAB841501AA670">
much on the&s;e matters may not be &s;alutary, but I think a little attention will determine the point; for when we look on tho&s;e di&s;tricts within the United States, in which all legal protection hath been denied to the in&s;titutions of religion, we can ea&s;ily trace the political evils, jealou&s;ies and confu&s;ion which have en&s;ued.</P>
<P>SCIENCE is friendly to religion and good or|der, and on this ground claims protection from government. The expences of education are the mo&s;t economical depo&s;it which can be made for the liberties of our offspring. Men of in|formation will neither forfeit, nor quietly &s;ub|mit to the lo&s;s of their civil rights; but the ig|norant are en&s;nared by their brethren. Much therefore is due to the minds of our youth, who will fill the fir&s;t offices in the &s;tate and in the church and be the only pillars of order, when a few years have laid this honorable and pious A&s;&s;embly in the du&s;t.</P>
<P>IF religion and &s;cience are the &s;trength of the &s;tate, and the pre&s;ervation of public liberty, we ought to reflect with gratitude on the good|ne&s;s of GOD, in furni&s;hing &s;o many characters eminent in both. When we look on this col|lection, it calls to our remembrance many of our fathers, who, by their piety and wi&s;dom, were pillars in our I&s;rael; and who now receive a more permanent reward than men can give. It is but a &s;mall return, which even a grate|ful people can make to the fidelity of their rulers; but tho we cannot reward, an acknow|ledgement of the obligation is beautiful, and mu&s;t encourage their hearts in doing us good.

<P>HONORABLE GENTLEMEN,</P>
<P>THIS annual pre&s;entment before GOD, of the Rulers and chief E&s;tates of the land, is an event which mu&s;t intere&s;t the feelings of a pious mind. It cannot fail to enkindle in us a reve|rent devotion, when we behold the princes, the heads of families and repre&s;entatives of the peo|ple, addre&s;&s;ing our heavenly King for his ble&s;|&s;ing and direction. This anniver&s;ary of wor|&s;hip is a &s;olemn engagement before GOD, that the government &s;hall be according to his will; that a re&s;pect for his in&s;titutions &s;hall be main|tained, and religion encouraged. If you, who are the honorables of the land, countenance virtue and ju&s;tice; if piety is con&s;picuous in your lives; if indu&s;try, temperance, ju&s;tice and a fear of GOD, are patronized by the laws you enact; if you appoint per&s;ons of wi&s;dom and di&s;creet goodne&s;s to execute the laws of the State; good order will prevail and vice be a&s;hamed: But without this aid from you, Hon|orable Gentlemen, there is rea&s;on to expect that licentiou&s;ne&s;s will break over every bar|rier, di&s;honor GOD who hath &s;o often protected this people and their fathers, and induce a gen|eral wretchedne&s;s. The experience of all peo|ple witne&s;&s;es the &s;acred truth, that righteou&s;|ne&s;s exalteth a nation; and it is al&s;o a truth as certainly known, that the manners of a people, do in a great mea&s;ure take their complexion

<P>THE local &s;ituation of your honorable body, in every part of the State; your opportunity for per&s;onal ob&s;ervation of the manners in eve|ry di&s;trict;&mdash;the force of your example, unit|ed with legi&s;lative authority, will e&s;&s;entially aid you in doing what is reque&s;ted.

There is every rea&s;on, that we u&s;e a greater diligence than oth|er men, in promoting a divine knowledge of GOD and his Son, love, faith, vital piety, expe|rimental religion and a good practice. If tho&s;e who act in the civil department, are judged guilty for &s;piritual negligence; how much greater is the criminality of a go&s;pel mini&s;ter, who is expre&s;sly &s;et apart as a watchman for the &s;ouls of men. From the advantage to be deri|ved in this life, we have the &s;ame inducement as other men, to urge the power and practice of godline&s;s; national pro&s;perity is a motive which will animate the heart of every good man. Tho not cloathed with civil power, we are con|nected with the &s;tate. Wi&s;e men of every pro|fe&s;&s;ion, know the &s;alutary influence of an en|lightened and pious clergy, on the civil &s;y&s;tem, and therefore much is expected from us; and much may be done to advance ju&s;tice and peace, encourage obedience to the laws, and &s;tength|en the hand of government.

For the right performance of the&s;e duties, there is a pe|culiar nece&s;&s;ity that we take much care of our own hearts, and be per&s;onally warmed with love to GOD and men.

Let us be united in a fer|vent charity, and in &s;upplication for an out|powering of the &s;pirit, on us and on our church|es, and when our LORD cometh he will make us perfect unto eternal peace.</P>
<P>MY Brethren of every character, let us re|&s;olve here before the LORD that we will &s;erve him. Ble&s;&s;ed are the righteous; but one &s;in|ner de&s;troyeth much good, and di&s;turbeth his land.
