<HEAD>AN INAUGURAL DISSERTATION.</HEAD>
<P>IN Augu&s;t, 1796, the town of Bo&s;|ton was vi&s;ited with a contagious di&s;ea&s;e of unu&s;ual malignancy, the circum&s;tances and marks of which were &s;uch as threatened great ca|lamity; and the alarm &s;pread, and became almo&s;t univer&s;al. This &s;till increa&s;ed, on ob&s;erving that in many of its &s;ymptoms it bore great re&s;emblance to the fever which had &s;o recently raged at Phila|delphia and New-York.</P>
<P>IN the preceding fall and winter, inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es were frequent in Bo&s;ton, and in many of the towns in the country, particularly the &s;carlati|na, &s;carlatina, angino&s;a, and mea&s;les. And in the months of June, July and Augu&s;t, or immediately previous to the di&s;ea&s;e we have mentioned, a &s;pe|cies of dy&s;entery was frequent; and now and then
<PB N="4" REF="031881_0003_0FEF09305EFF1AB8">
ca&s;es of cholera morbus occurred. The&s;e were in &s;ome places unu&s;ually mortal, and prevailed more or le&s;s in different parts of Bo&s;ton till the time of the bilious fever; after which they were known no more.</P>
<P>BEFORE entering more particularly on the &s;ub|ject of the <HI>fever,</HI> I &s;hall introduce &s;ome ob&s;erva|tions on the effects of <HI>poi&s;ons,</HI> and their laws of operation on the human &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="observations">
<HEAD>OF POISONS.</HEAD>
<P>THESE are &s;ub&s;tances which either in&s;tantly de&s;troy the life of a part or parts of the &s;y&s;tem, or change the natural functions into morbid actions; and thereby, &s;uddenly or by degrees, affect the whole con&s;titution.</P>
<P>THEY are either <HI>mineral, vegetable,</HI> or <HI>animal.</HI>&mdash;The damps or mephitic vapours often met with in mines and deep wells, are <HI>mineral poi&s;ons.</HI> Of <HI>vege|table poi&s;ons</HI> we have a remarkable in&s;tance in the Bohan Upas, which grows on the i&s;land of Java, belonging to the Dutch. It is &s;o de&s;tructively poi|&s;onous, we are told, as that the &s;oil for &s;everal miles in circumference is whitened with the bones of birds and animals, that have been arre&s;ted while attempting to pa&s;s through the atmo&s;phere of this &s;hrub of death. <HI>Animal poi&s;ons</HI> are of two kinds;
<PB N="5" REF="031881_0004_0FEF09334229ECB0">
original, as that &s;ecreted by the viper; and &s;uch as are generated by di&s;ea&s;e. The latter are, by Mr. Hunter, and afterwards by others, denominated <HI>morbid poi&s;ons.</HI></P>
<P>POISONS are communicated either in a ga&s;&s;ous or vaporous &s;tate; or by contact, in the form of pus, or ulcerous matter. Fevers are an example of the former, the venerea of the latter.</P>
<P>THE con&s;titution is never affected, or never takes on the morbid action of the poi&s;on, except it be in a &s;tate of <HI>predi&s;po&s;ition.</HI> Thus, at the time of any raging epidemic, the <HI>mia&s;ma</HI> or putrid effluvia is generally di&s;per&s;ed, and different ages, &s;exes and con&s;titutions are alike expo&s;ed; yet comparatively but few will be infected, while the others e&s;cape. How the &s;ame con&s;titution &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s different &s;u&s;ceptibilities to di&s;ea&s;e, is be&s;t under&s;tood from Dr. Brown and Dr. Darwin.</P>
<P>ANIMAL exi&s;tence, according to Dr. Brown, is endowed with a quality which he names <HI>excitability,</HI> and Dr. Darwin <HI>the &s;pirit of animation,</HI> or <HI>&s;en&s;orial power,</HI> on which the phenomena of life depend. Every thing which &s;upports life, exerts it&s;elf on this principle; and <HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI> It is capable of different degrees of accumulation and exhau&s;tion: it is accumulated by the ab&s;traction of &s;timuli, and is exhau&s;ted by exce&s;&s;ive &s;timuli, or the long appli|cation of others acting more moderately. A due proportion between the exciting powers, &s;uch as
<PB N="6" REF="031881_0005_0FEF0934F1EAD2E8">
heat, food, air, mental exertion, &amp;c. and the excita|bility or &s;en&s;orial power, con&s;titutes health; and every variation from either is di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<LG>
<L>"There is, they &s;ay, and I believe there is,</L>
<L>A &s;park within us of th' immortal fire,</L>
<L>That animates and moulds the gro&s;&s;er frame,</L>
<L>And when the body &s;inks, e&s;capes to heaven,</L>
<L>Its native &s;eat.</L>
<L>Meanwhile this heav'nly particle pervades</L>
<L>The mortal elements,&mdash;</L>
<L>And in its &s;ecret conclave, as it feels</L>
<L>The body's woes and joys, this ruling pow'r</L>
<L>Wields at its will the dull material world,</L>
<L>And is the body's health or malady."</L>
</LG>
<P>WITH many di&s;ea&s;es of the variolous kind, there is a certain period between the time the infection is received, and the appearance of the di&s;ea&s;e; and in this interval &s;carce any alteration in the actions of life can be perceived. Thus, in the ca&s;ual &s;mall pox, we find a &s;pace of about twelve days between the reception of the poi&s;onous effluvia and the fir&s;t &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e. Travellers fre|quently leave the country where they received the mia&s;ma of ague, long before any &s;ymptoms of it appear; yet the di&s;po&s;ition having been formed, and the poi&s;on received, the di&s;ea&s;e after a certain period makes its appearance.</P>
<P>IT &s;ometimes happens, that after the di&s;po&s;ition is given and the poi&s;on received into the &s;y&s;tem, the period of eruption, or the time when the di&s;ea&s;e
<PB N="7" REF="031881_0006_0FEF093B73FD47C8">
u&s;ually appears, is protracted beyond the u&s;ual time, in con&s;equence of the action of other di&s;ea&s;es, as the mea&s;les, &s;crophula, &amp;c. This is confirmed by various hi&s;tories of the &s;mall pox.</P>
<P>FURTHER&mdash;We have great rea&s;on to believe, that not only the morbid action or &s;ymptoms of a di&s;ea&s;e may be &s;u&s;pended, but al&s;o that the <HI>&s;u&s;cepti|bility</HI> may be entirely prevented after the poi&s;on is applied. There is a &s;triking proof of this afforded us in the effect of the Harmattan wind, as recorded in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions of London.&mdash;Seventy negroes were inoculated for the <HI>&s;mall pox</HI> three days after the Harmattan &s;et in: none of them had the &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e. In a few weeks afterwards, fifty of the &s;ame were inoculated, and had the di&s;ea&s;e; the re&s;t had taken it in the natural way. Here, though the infectious matter was applied to &s;eventy, all of them (as appeared af|terwards) con&s;titutionally &s;u&s;ceptible of the di&s;ea&s;e, yet even the local di&s;po&s;ition was &s;uperceded, and of cour&s;e the con&s;titution was not infected.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Adams on the phagedena, &amp;c.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE immediately preceding propo&s;itions are in proof of a medical axiom e&s;tabli&s;hed by Dr. Hun|ter, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> That the con&s;titution never &s;upports the operation of two di&s;tinct di&s;ea&s;es at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>IT is a law with mo&s;t of tho&s;e poi&s;ons which pro|duce their effects by a <HI>critical fever,</HI> that a con&s;titu|tion which has once gone through the action ex|cited by them, is no longer &s;u&s;ceptible of it. This
<PB N="8" REF="031881_0007_0FEF093EAD400BA0">
is accounted for upon the principle, that the poi&s;on is &s;o powerful and active as to de&s;troy the &s;en&s;ibility or life of the part; or that the con&s;titution becomes habituated to the particular &s;timuli of the poi&s;on, and therefore upon a &s;econd application to the part or parts of the &s;y&s;tem, they are undi&s;turbed by or are in&s;en&s;ible to it. This will account for the &s;ud|den and &s;eemingly miraculous di&s;appearance of epidemics, as was the ca&s;e at Philadelphia and New-York; for all tho&s;e who had a &s;u&s;ceptibility to the di&s;ea&s;e have taken it and are not liable to be again affected by it, and tho&s;e who have not this &s;u&s;cep|tibility cannot receive it; of cour&s;e, the prevalence of the di&s;ea&s;e mu&s;t &s;uddenly cea&s;e.</P>
<P>POISONS, mia&s;ma or morbific effluvia are of too &s;ubtle a nature for chemical analy&s;is; their con&s;tit|uent materials, and the prevailing or di&s;tingui&s;hing principle of each, whether an acid or an alkali, &s;ep|ton or nitrous acid gas, or any other gas, is totally unknown.</P>
<P>VENEREAL and phagedenic poi&s;ons, though in the form of fluid di&s;charge and &s;ubject to ob&s;erva|tion, and even to be experimented upon; yet it is equally unknown what material quality con&s;titutes their nature, and renders them capable of their &s;pe|cific effects. Do not mo&s;t poi&s;ons contain a princi|ple of life, which occa&s;ions their activity, and by means of which their deleterious effects are pro|duced, when taken into the human &s;y&s;tem?</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="031881_0008_0FEF09405C77BC28">
Dr. Hunter has long &s;ince di&s;covered and dem|on&s;trated that the dige&s;tive organs have no power over &s;ub&s;tances which have within them the princi|ple of life. There are many circum&s;tances which render probable this opinion re&s;pecting poi&s;ons, contagious ones in particular. In the <HI>itch,</HI> animal|culae are probably the cau&s;e of this affection. And why may not the <HI>&s;yphilis</HI> be produced in a &s;imilar manner, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> by an accumulated and mixed quantity of &s;eminal animalculae lodged in tho&s;e re&s;ervoirs and rece&s;&s;es peculiar to the parts concerned? Lodged in this abundance, they may by their own activity in&s;inuate into the &s;y&s;tem, and form nidi; or they may become putrid, and thus produce the &s;pecific venom of the &s;yphilitic di&s;ea&s;e. Thus al&s;o with other animalculae, introduced by re&s;piration or cu|ticular ab&s;orption.</P>
<P>IN the tropical regions, where death has almo&s;t an undi&s;puted reign, the atmo&s;phere is generally loaded with myriads of animalculae; &s;o much &s;o, at certain times in the rainy &s;ea&s;ons, as nearly to &s;uffocate the inhabitants. It is then that di&s;ea&s;es mo&s;tly prevail. Life is always found where there is a congeniality of matter for its reception; and every object in nature, animate and inanimate, healthy or di&s;ea&s;ed, has its particular &s;phere of ex|halation. This exhalation <HI>always</HI> partakes of the nature and life of its &s;ubject.</P>
<P>HOWEVER homogenous poi&s;ons are while they form the atmo&s;phere of the &s;ubject from whence
<PB N="10" REF="031881_0009_0FEF09420201C370">
they were exhaled; yet being in contact with other &s;pheres of exhalation, they are blended with other &s;ub&s;tances which form the common atmo&s;phere; and at length are &s;o equilibriated, by entering into new forms and &s;tates, as to lo&s;e their activity and power to injure.</P>
<P>IT is a univer&s;al truth, equally applicable to poi|&s;ons as to other things, that the more &s;imple and homogenous a &s;ub&s;tance is, the more powerful and active; and <HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI></P>
<P>THE atmo&s;phere in which we live is made up of exhalations from every individual &s;ub&s;tance in all the three kingdoms of nature&mdash;the animal, vegeta|ble, and mineral: the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances form a perpet|ual intermediation of <HI>le&s;s</HI> and <HI>more &s;ubtle,</HI> until they reach the &s;un him&s;elf, the great &s;en&s;orium of ma|terial nature, which by them is nouri&s;hed and fed, in return for the activity which it imparts. Our atmo&s;phere, in all its extent, becomes blended al&s;o with the atmo&s;pheres of other planets, and they, in union, form one common atmo&s;phere of the whole &s;y&s;tem. This idea might be extended &s;o far as to form one general atmo&s;phere for the univer&s;e; but this would be filling up Newton's VACUUM, which might expo&s;e us to the imputation of philo&s;ophical &s;ceptici&s;m.</P>
<P>THIS blending the common atmo&s;pheres of each planet, and giving them reciprocal influence on each other, may be of u&s;e in explaining many of the di&s;ea&s;es and affections of the human body, &s;ub|ject
<PB N="11" REF="031881_0010_0FEF09456945C008">
to periodic returns and regular intervals, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> in|termittent fevers, the various &s;pecies of maenorrhagia, epi&s;taxis, and haemorrhois. A late writer has ob|&s;erved, that the paroxy&s;ms of fevers &s;hew them|&s;elves in a greater degree of violence about the full and change of the moon, that is to &s;ay, about three days and an half before and after, including at each period a &s;pace of about &s;even days, than during the interval between the&s;e periods. Al&s;o&mdash;That the paroxy&s;ms of fevers occurring during the periods de&s;cribed, are con&s;tantly more violent about mid-day and midnight, than during the intervals between the&s;e &s;paces.&mdash;That &s;ome remarkable abatement in the violence of the paroxy&s;m never fails to take place, upon the expiration of the full and change of the moon.&mdash;That the paroxy&s;ms of fevers, whil&s;t they abate in violence upon the expiration of the full and change, &s;hift al&s;o their attack to a later hour.&mdash;That epilep&s;y, in|&s;anity, paralytic affections, a&s;thmas, phthi&s;ical coughs, with a variety of other complaints, often a&s;&s;umed an intermittent form, and returned regu|larly with the full and change of the moon, and di&s;appeared or dimini&s;hed during the intervals.</P>
<P>THIS &s;ol-lunar influence has been noticed by the ingenious author of Zoonomia; and perhaps better accounted for than by any predece&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>MOST of the above ob&s;ervations are capable of &s;atisfactory proof, and have long been acknowledg|ed by the be&s;t medical writers; &s;o that they may be
<PB N="12" REF="031881_0011_0FEF094BEA739590">
con&s;idered as &s;o many medical axioms. They may be of u&s;e in con&s;idering our &s;ubject&mdash;on which I now enter.</P>
<P>I HAVE ob&s;erved, that the fever, when it made its fir&s;t appearance, &s;hewed &s;trong marks of malig|nancy. The patient, after &s;ome hours of unu&s;ual dullne&s;s or dead heavy &s;en&s;ation in the head, and great reluctance for any voluntary motion, felt great commotion and unea&s;ine&s;s at the &s;tomach, which con&s;tantly increa&s;ed till vomiting commenc|ed. At each of the &s;everal vomitings, attend|ed with &s;evere wretchings, much bilious matter was thrown up; and there was found, in many in&s;tances, a porraceous &s;ub&s;tance, re&s;embling the &s;ettlings of coffee. The &s;tomach &s;hewed unu&s;ual &s;ymptoms of irritability, it being almo&s;t impo&s;&s;i|ble to keep down for a moment the milde&s;t medicine that could be admini&s;tered. In the inter|vals of vomiting, particularly, a con&s;tant and great|ly exhau&s;ting pain was felt; mo&s;t exqui&s;ite at the &s;mall of the back, and extending along the &s;pine and its connexions quite up to the occiput. Pain of head continuing, e&s;pecially over the eyes and un|der the temporal bones, &s;ometimes with a &s;en&s;ation as if &s;ome in&s;trument had pa&s;&s;ed the head. Re&s;pi|ration extremely difficult, often with a feel of &s;uf|focation. Heat very great, e&s;pecially in the thorax and region of the <HI>liver.</HI> Pul&s;e morbidly rapid. Pores clo&s;ed. Skin &s;mooth, and apparently di&s;tend|ed
<PB N="13" REF="031881_0012_0FEF094D7904A248">
with the expanded fluids and heat within; hav|ing a tinge, &s;omewhat re&s;embling that of chlorotic patients. The cornea albuginea mo&s;t re&s;embling, in colour, that of du&s;ky gla&s;s when held up to the light. The eyes, however, expre&s;&s;ed much concern, and often moved with a furious rapidity in the early &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e. The&s;e all increa&s;ed, if po&s;&s;ible, in violence till death put an end to the patient's &s;ufferings; or gradually &s;ub&s;ided, when the fever vani&s;hed, and health was re&s;tored.</P>
<P>THOUGH the&s;e were the characteri&s;tic &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e, yet they were generally variant in their commencement, progre&s;s and termination, accord|ing to the difference of temperament; and al&s;o ac|cording to the difference in the predi&s;po&s;ing cau&s;es.</P>
<P>SLIGHT &s;ymptoms, &s;carcely noticed by the patient or his friends, were &s;ometimes the harbingers of this fever: Al&s;o, languor, yawning, dejection of &s;pirits, &s;leep di&s;turbed and not refre&s;hing, appetite impaired, di&s;agreeable ta&s;te and &s;mell, and uncom|mon &s;en&s;ibility to cold, were &s;ometimes among the early &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e. In others the &s;ymp|toms were more rapid and inten&s;e; per&s;ons &s;ome|times being rou&s;ed from &s;leep by a mo&s;t torturous &s;en&s;ation in the &s;tomach, near its connexion with the duodenum, re&s;embling liquid fire &s;preading over this vi&s;cus and extending, in the direction of the arteries, quite through both upper and lower extremities.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="031881_0013_0FEF095076E9EC20">
SOME were affected with alternations of heat and cold; with others, the heat was continual. The appearance of the tongue was various; &s;ometimes it was moi&s;t, as in catarrhal defluxion; at other times was parched and dry. The breath, however, was invariably di&s;agreeable, and &s;ometimes &s;o of|fen&s;ive as to be almo&s;t intolerable to the patient him&s;elf. Pul&s;e often various in the &s;ame per&s;ons; &s;ometimes having the regularity and force of &s;y|nocha; at other times weak, fluttering, indi&s;tinct and vibratory; manife&s;ting very great debility. Co&s;tivene&s;s prevailed with the mo&s;t, e&s;pecially in the fir&s;t &s;tages of the fever; and all the &s;ecretions and excretions partook of the great di&s;order of the &s;y&s;tem. None were in a healthy &s;tate; all either in a high degree of exce&s;s, or greatly dimin|i&s;hed.</P>
<P>OTHER &s;ymptoms, more particular, might be enumerated; but they would neither direct to a rational <HI>indication,</HI> nor a&s;&s;i&s;t to form a probable</P>

<HEAD>PROGNOSIS.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ymptoms which might be con&s;idered as the heralds of approaching death, were excruciating pain in the loins, through the &s;pine, and in all the larger or principal mu&s;cles. Exce&s;&s;ive irritability of the &s;tomach, &s;o much &s;o as to refu&s;e all acce&s;s to medicine. Great pain over the eyes and in the eye|balls; this pain increa&s;ing to delirium or madne&s;s.

The pupil of the eye dilated, and the patient &s;tretch|ed on his back&mdash;limbs extended and motionle&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>PROXIMATE OR EXCITING CAUSE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS, in my opinion, is morbid effluvia, fir&s;t lodged in the &s;aliva; thence conveyed and lodged in the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines; here either pervert|ing or totally de&s;troying the dige&s;tive powers of the&s;e vi&s;cera: thereby a putrid and highly corro|&s;ive ma&s;s is generated, in&s;tead of a mild and bland &s;ub&s;tance to give nouri&s;hment to animal life. The &s;urrounding blood ve&s;&s;els feel the change and are affected. The my&s;enteric veins, e&s;pecially, from contiguity, become loaded with a putrid ma&s;s of in|dige&s;ted &s;ub&s;tances, which are conveyed through the venae portarum into the liver. This important vi&s;cus becomes di&s;ordered; the bile is thrown into the inte&s;tines and up into the &s;tomach in unu&s;ual quantities and in an acrid &s;tate. This &s;till increa&s;es the difficulty; the &s;tomach and bowels are heated and inflamed, and puking en&s;ues. The venae haepa|ticae empty a heterogeneous ma&s;s of black damaged fluid into the right ventricle, which is immediately
<PB N="16" REF="031881_0015_0FEF095896ED4EF8">
thrown into the lungs. The lungs, in turn, are af|fected by the di&s;order; the patulous mouths of the ab&s;orbing ve&s;&s;els are clo&s;ed by pre&s;&s;ure on the &s;ub&s;tance of the lungs from the fluid within. The blood no longer receives its congenial nouri&s;h|ment; but is conveyed by the veins of the lungs into the left ventricle of the heart; and, if this Al|pha and Omega of animal life has not lo&s;t its power, is thence di&s;tributed in a highly putrid &s;tate into the &s;everal parts of the body. The whole va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem is thrown into irritation and commotion by unu&s;ual &s;timuli; the ma&s;s of blood is de&s;troyed, and the patient dies: Or, the powers of life, collected as in a focus, act with accumulated force, &s;ubdue the offending cau&s;es, &s;eparate and di&s;charge the impu|rities by the &s;everal emunctories, and the patient recovers.</P>
<P>THAT the mia&s;ma is fir&s;t lodged in the &s;aliva, and thence carried into the &s;tomach and bowels is probable from this circum&s;tance; we often hear per&s;ons complain, after being over an infected &s;ub|ject, that they not only <HI>&s;melt</HI> the putrid exhalations, but <HI>ta&s;ted</HI> them for a long time afterwards; and that nothing would remove the di&s;agreeable ta&s;te. Probably, however, a part of the contagion finds a direct way into the ma&s;s of blood through the ab|&s;orbents of the lungs.</P>

difficult to conceive, e&s;pecially if they contain a principle of &s;pecific life. Life acting again&s;t life, is like the meeting of two oppo&s;ite powers in nature, in which ca&s;e the one will de&s;troy the other; and where life is de&s;troyed putrefaction will take place, whence a contagion may ari&s;e too great for the re|maining power of life to reject or remove, which of cour&s;e will in its turn be either impaired or de&s;troy|ed. Be&s;ides, we know that per&s;ons are often thrown into the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing di&s;orders by worms and animalculae lodged in the &s;tomach and bowels in an oviform &s;tate, in con&s;equence of eating raw fruit and other uncooked &s;ub&s;tances. The&s;e al&s;o may and often do concur to make human contagion more fatal.</P>
<P>THAT the &s;tomach and bowels are the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> affect|ed, is evident from the &s;evere pain that is early felt in the loins, and from the early tendency to puking.</P>
<P>THAT the liver is affected is evident from the large di&s;charges of bilious matter by the &s;tomach and &s;tool; and that the lungs are, is plain from the difficult re&s;piration, which was always an attend|ant &s;ymptom of the di&s;ea&s;e. In all the &s;ubjects dead of the yellow fever, that have been di&s;&s;ected, the liver and the lungs had almo&s;t univer&s;ally a morbid appearance.

THAT the life of the blood is either greatly im|paired or totally de&s;troyed, is manife&s;t from the pains in the mu&s;cles and in the head; from delirium and coma; from vibices, petechiae and yellowne&s;s of the &s;kin, &amp;c.</P>
<P>DR. Anthony Fothergill, however, &s;ays, in oppo|&s;ition to Drs. Harvey, Willis, Hunter, and others, that "the blood is not alive, but is a mere pa&s;&s;ive inorganic ma&s;s."

<P>FURTHER on, Dr. Fothergill, in his ingenious treati&s;e, (for &s;uch we e&s;teem it in general) denies his major propo&s;ition. He &s;ays, "The nervous in|fluence, &s;en&s;ibility, or as Dr. Darwin elegantly ex|pre&s;&s;es it, <HI>the &s;pirit of animation,</HI> cannot be a &s;e|creted fluid, &s;ince the brain is no longer allowed by anatomi&s;ts to be a &s;ecretory organ.

Darwin is fully of the opinion that the rudiments or living ens of the future embryo is derived wholly from the male parent; that this ens or rudiment con&s;i&s;ts of a living filament or &s;tamen, and that this fil|ament, of whatever form it may be, is endued with the <HI>capability</HI> of be|ing excited into action by certain kinds of &s;timulus. Rou&s;ed into ac|tivity by the &s;timulus of the nutritive and congenial fluid in which it is received from the male parent, it receives new adaptations or accre|tions of &s;ub&s;tances, and thus becomes organized. With every new change of organic form or addition of organic parts, a new kind of irri|tability or of &s;en&s;ibility [which is only a more general &s;en&s;ation] is pro|duced; the&s;e varieties of irritability or of &s;en&s;ibility exi&s;t in our adult &s;tate in the glands; [perhaps in all the parts of di&s;tinct functions] every one of which is furni&s;hed with an irritability, or a ta&s;te, or appetency, and a con&s;equent mode of action peculiar to it&s;elf. The&s;e changes in|crea&s;e, and additions of parts with their peculiar irritabilities or appe|tences and con&s;equent modes of action, continue in progre&s;&s;ive order till the embryo is complete in form. The parts mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential to life are fir&s;t produced. Thus, the brain to di&s;pen&s;e the powers of life, next the heart, then the lungs, and from the&s;e all the parts of the &s;y&s;tem, ac|cording to the importance of their functions in the animal economy. Sec. 39, Vol. I.</P>
<P>THUS then it &s;eems to be the opinion of Dr. Darwin that the <HI>e&s;&s;e</HI> or e&s;|&s;ence of the embryo is from the male parent, and that the <HI>exi&s;ter&eacute;,</HI> or exi&s;tence, is from the female parent; of this there is no want of proof convincing. This <HI>e&s;&s;e,</HI> or as Dr. Darwin names it, <HI>living ens,</HI> always po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es the <HI>conatus</HI> or <HI>endeavour</HI> to a&s;&s;ume a form &s;imilar to the male parent or progenitor, which it always will do when lodged in the proper matrix or mould, and &s;upplied with the congenial nouri&s;hment; this, with ani|mals, is always from the female. Perhaps, Dr. Darwin means the &s;ame thing by <HI>"the capability of being excited into action by certain &s;timuli."</HI> This conatus or endeavour of the <HI>&s;eminal germ</HI> to produce or a&s;&s;ume the form of its progenitor exi&s;ts not only with every order, genera, &s;pecies and creature of the animal kingdom, but al&s;o with every order, genera, &s;pecies and thing of the vegetable kingdom. Thus every creature and thing is pre&s;erved in its order and di&s;tinction. This pre&s;ervation by generation and prolification, production and reproduction, and con&s;e|quent increa&s;e and multiplication, &s;ugge&s;ts and impre&s;&s;es mo&s;t &s;trongly the idea of <HI>infinity</HI> and <HI>eternity,</HI> and clearly evinces the wi&s;dom and good|ne&s;s of the "CAUSE OF ALL CAUSES!

<P>DR.

<P>HE again &s;ays&mdash;"The vital power is intimately connected with the <HI>&s;en&s;orium commune,</HI> and this with the &s;oul, which certainly is of u&s;e in the medical &s;y&s;tem, though by no means a rational conductor."

<P><PB N="22" REF="031881_0021_0FEF096B83DB4E00">
DR. Cullen thinks al&s;o, that "the &s;oul influences the body not as a <HI>prime mover,</HI> but as a modifier of external &s;en&s;es." What higher power than the modifier of external &s;en&s;es, which all exi&s;t from in|terior life? But again&mdash;</P>
<P>THE Doctor is of opinion that "all our functions are governed by certain laws, that we may ob&s;erve and di&s;tinctly mark, &s;o as to know their con&s;e|quences; &s;o that the <HI>con&s;ideration</HI> of the &s;oul, in a medical view, is of no weight."

<P>ONCE more&mdash;<HI>"Medicamentum non agit in cada|ver,"</HI> &s;ays the Doctor; which is, in Engli&s;h phra&s;e|ology, Medicine operates only on life; and yet he agrees with Dr. Boerhaave, that "when a problem is traced up to the connexion between &s;oul and body, there we ought to &s;top, and con&s;ider it as re|&s;olved." Some of the above problems cannot be either &s;olved or re&s;olved, even by this connexion. But I think this is the very point from which we ought to &s;et out, if we ever expect rightly to inve&s;|tigate the phenomena of life.</P>
<P>WHAT is the &s;oul but life? and again, what is life? <HI>"Cogito ergo &s;um,"</HI> &s;aid Des Cartes&mdash;We can only know it by its operations, <HI>principally</HI> within our&s;elves. It is the &s;oul or life which &s;ees, feels, hears, ta&s;tes, is &s;en&s;ible of plea&s;ure or pain, deter|mines our limbs to motion, &amp;c. wills, thinks and
<PB N="23" REF="031881_0022_0FEF096D155EC3A0">
knows. If it be a&s;ked how and whence it is deriv|ed to the body? I can at pre&s;ent only reply by pointing to &s;ome of its more interior effects. Ob|&s;erve, then, the dominion and influence the mind has over all the mo&s;t important functions, which &s;upport the economy of life. It actuates the body in all its parts at plea&s;ure. The mind directs the ear to hear, di&s;po&s;es the eyes to &s;ee, moves the tongue and lips to &s;peak, and the hands to do what|ever it plea&s;es. Thus the body is nothing but obedience to the mind; but can it be thus unle&s;s there were a mo&s;t intimate connexion between the mind and the body? not &s;uch a connexion as is be|tween what is above and what is below, as oil on water, but &s;uch a connexion as exi&s;ts between cau&s;e and effect, the one produced from the other. Ev|ery one, the lea&s;t &s;killed in anatomy, mu&s;t have learnt how entirely every part and function of the human &s;y&s;tem is actuated and lives by the cardiac and pulmonic motions. But the&s;e two motions are entirely &s;ubject to the two con&s;tituent principles or powers of the mind, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the will and the under|&s;tanding. The will is immediately operative in all the &s;eries of catenated motions denominated invol|untary; but the heart exhibits mo&s;t di&s;tinctly the will's influence in the &s;y&s;tem. Its motions are &s;low or rapid, calm or tumultuous, according to the va|rious affections of the will; of this we have &s;en&s;i|ble proof by means of the pul&s;e.</P>
<P>EVERY one who has &s;een the force of <HI>love,</HI> (which re&s;ides wholly in the will, and, as a general principle
<PB N="24" REF="031881_0023_0FEF0971C240D3F8">
comprehending every kind of affection, is in fact its life) knows how it actuates the body by its pow|er over the heart's motions; producing, when in|ten&s;e, delirium, phrenzy, apoplexy, and &s;ometimes death. When the love glows, the body is warm, the variations of the heat of the body always tally|ing with the variations of love or affection, whatever be its object, from the <HI>freezing point,</HI> or the extinc|tion of love, to any indefinite degree of inten&s;ene&s;s.</P>
<P>THE under&s;tanding or thinking principle of the mind influences mainly the pulmonic motions. Thus, if we think tacitly, we breathe tacitly; if we think deeply, we breathe deeply; we draw in and relax, compre&s;s and elevate our lungs either &s;lowly, eagerly, mildly or attentively, in perfect con|formity to the different &s;tates of the thoughts. Now it is a maxim of true philo&s;ophy, that what is &s;upe|rior in power is prior in exi&s;tence, and that the con|trolling force does not originate from the thing controlled: This is al&s;o agreeable to every rule of ju&s;t conclu&s;ion. Where the re&s;idence of the mind is fixed, we have no other way of inve&s;tigating, but to trace the nerves to where they begin and end; for all our &s;en&s;ation is tran&s;mitted by means of tho&s;e nerves called &s;en&s;ory nerves, to the inward &s;en&s;ori|um, and &s;o to the under&s;tanding. Thus the &s;en&s;ations go by the optic nerves from the eyes; and from the no&s;trils by the olfactory nerves, or proce&s;&s;us ma|millaris; from the ears by the auditory nerves, and &s;o on. Therefore, that the beginning and ending may be &s;ound, we mu&s;t examine all the brain, and
<PB N="25" REF="031881_0024_0FEF0975285CEE78">
not de&s;i&s;t till we find the ends and beginnings of the nerves. Having, therefore, di&s;&s;ected the brain, we meet with little &s;pheres, round, or fully wrapped inward and outward, commonly called the cortical glands, where the nerves begin and end, and where the mind in its principles re&s;ides, and acts from the beginnings of all the nerves; for to the&s;e &s;pheres, as to their ultimate ends, all the nerves are center|ed. Thence the mind deduces and collects all the modes of appearance and operation tran&s;mitted by the &s;en&s;es, and thence di&s;tributes them round to the interior perception and under&s;tanding. All the nerves, whatever be their office, are formed and produced from the&s;e glands; wherefore this is our common &s;en&s;orium: from hence al&s;o proceeds our intimate &s;en&s;e, or under&s;tanding, which perceives by its &s;en&s;es, thinks on what it perceives; and judging on what it thinks, choo&s;es what is judged be&s;t; from what it choo&s;es, de&s;ires; and la&s;tly, from the will of its de&s;ire, acts. That the mind or &s;pirit thus re&s;ides in its principles in the brain, and in its prin|cipiates in the body, is manife&s;t from experience; for the glands being affected, the whole appendix of the brain and body langui&s;h in proportion, the power of imagination is &s;tupefied; the cogitations langui&s;h; the memory fails; the determinations of the will he&s;itate; the de&s;ires fail, and the &s;en&s;es are dulled. But notwith&s;tanding this defect in the op|erations of the mind in con&s;equence of defect in the organization of the brain, it is not to be thence in|ferred that the mind it&s;elf is nothing more than ma|terial
<PB N="26" REF="031881_0025_0FEF0978C4C26DF8">
organization, however highly &s;ublimated; for we hold the &s;oul or mind, though giving life to the body, to be perfectly di&s;tinct from it in degree, bearing the &s;ame relation to it as what is prior to what is po&s;terior, or, as cau&s;e and effect; &s;o that one is in the other not in continuous but in di&s;crete order. Hence it follows, that though the latter can have no exi&s;tence without the former, yet the for|mer can exi&s;t without the latter, as is the ca&s;e when the body is entirely rejected at death. But till then the mind is &s;o far dependent on the body, that it cannot manife&s;t its operation in outward nature, un|le&s;s by rightly di&s;po&s;ed organs; and if there be im|pediments in the corporeal organs, the perfection of the mind will al&s;o be impeded during its connexion with them, through a want of afflux and re-agency; for it is a received law, that influx is proportioned to afflux, agency to re-agency, &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE powers of life then which manife&s;t them|&s;elves in the body, we have ju&s;t rea&s;on to conclude are derived wholly from the mind, and flow &s;olely from a &s;piritual origin, the mind it&s;elf or &s;oul being probably an organized form, but &s;piritual, per|fectly di&s;tinct from the natural, though in it in ev|ery part throughout, and communicating life there|to; which life the &s;oul it&s;elf receives by continual influx from Deity, "in whom we live and move and have our being." Thus much on the que&s;|tion, What is life, and whence derived?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If the above ob&s;ervation be true, how evidently does the fallacy of that rea&s;oning appear, which, not di&s;tingui&s;hing the di&s;crete degrees of the operation of life, but &s;topping at proximate cau&s;es from the in|ductions of analy&s;is only, makes no di&s;tinction betwixt the life of a man and that of a brute. For if it be admitted, (and nothing can be more ea&s;ily admitted, nor more fully confirmed from the united te&s;timony of revelation, rea&s;on, and experience) that man is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the brutes by the faculty of thinking, not only analytically but &s;ynthetical|ly, and thereby of living not only the &s;en&s;ual and natural, but al&s;o the moral and &s;piritual life, it may be rationally concluded, that the &s;ame di&s;tinction prevails in regard to the faculty of living eternally. For it mu&s;t, on the &s;ame ground, be inferred, that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a &s;uperior de|gree of life or a form receptive of life more immediately from the Deity, whence he derives the capacity of being conjoined with the Deity by ac|knowledgment and affection, thus, by re-agency on his part; whence he con&s;equently al&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the faculty of retaining the influent life, and in this retention con&s;i&s;ts the ground of his eternal exi&s;tence.</NOTE></P>

LIFE then is in all and every part of the body; but &s;ome parts are endowed with a much greater &s;hare than others. In the brain it is as it were drawn to a focus. Indeed it is here, as we have ju&s;t ob&s;erv|ed, that fibre begins and circulation ends; con&s;e|quently here al&s;o is the connexion between fibre and blood. No doubt, when the blood arrives at the brain it becomes highly refined, and imparts a &s;ublimate matter, which becomes the immediate re|cipient of life, whence it is di&s;tributed by the nerves to all the parts in the curious mechani&s;m of man down to the ultimates of life. Now we have al|ready ob&s;erved, the le&s;s &s;imple and homogeneous any &s;ub&s;tance is, the more liable it is to injury and perver&s;ion.

THE powers of life, by this mode of living, are &s;trained to the highe&s;t pitch, and when expo&s;ed to di&s;ea&s;e, the con&s;titution has no new or unemployed force to repel the enemy.

<HEAD>TREATMENT, OR METHOD OF CURE.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ymptoms of the fever which we have de|&s;cribed certainly manife&s;t a very high degree of va&s;|cular irritability and excitement; the fir&s;t and lead|ing indication, therefore, is depletion by powerful e|vacuations, even to bleeding; and this with all po&s;&s;i|ble &s;peed. Jalap and calomel were early u&s;ed for this purpo&s;e by the mo&s;t celebrated practitioners of Bo&s;ton,
<PB N="31" REF="031881_0030_0FEF09872E0693D8">
who I believe can give fre&s;h te&s;timony of the pro|priety and benefit of the u&s;e of this medicine, fir&s;t recommended by Dr. Ru&s;h, of Philadelphia. My|&s;elf have witne&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t happy effects of this cathartic, when u&s;ed agreeably to the judicious di|rections of my preceptor.</P>
<P>IT is now generally thought that mercury, as u&s;ed in this di&s;order, produces its &s;alutary effects chiefly by operating as a quick and powerful cathartic, when combined with jalap; thereby cau&s;ing a large and &s;udden depletion of the inte&s;tines and the excretories that here empty them&s;elves. It is more|over certain that mercury in all its operations, al|ways affects the liver more or le&s;s. I believe that in the bilious fever it has almo&s;t a &s;pecific effect up|on this vi&s;cus by changing its morbid actions and re&s;toring its healthy functions, which, it cannot be doubted, are greatly deranged.</P>
<P>DR. Ru&s;h enumerates the effects of the u&s;e of jalap and calomel in this fever as follows. 1. It rai&s;ed the pul&s;e when low, and reduced it when it was preternaturally ten&s;e or full. 2. It revived and &s;trengthened the patient. 3. It abated the paroxy&s;m of the fever. 4. It frequently produced &s;weats when given on the fir&s;t and &s;econd day of the fever. 5. It &s;ometimes checked that vomiting which occurs in the beginning of the di&s;order; and it always a&s;&s;i&s;ted in preventing the more alarming occurrence of this &s;ymptom about the 4th and 5th day. 6. It removed ob&s;tructions in the lymphatic
<PB N="32" REF="031881_0031_0FEF098D8FC17668">
&s;y&s;tem. 7. It prevented in mo&s;t ca&s;es a yellowne&s;s of the &s;kin, by di&s;charging the bile through the bowels as &s;oon and as fa&s;t as it was &s;ecreted.</P>
<P>THE u&s;ual do&s;e, and I believe the be&s;t propor|tioned for an adult, was jalap 25gr. calomel 10gr. The intention for which this was given was not an|&s;wered unle&s;s it produced four or five di&s;charges.</P>
<P>No other regard is to be paid to time in the ad|mini&s;tration of this medicine than that it be given as early in the di&s;ea&s;e as po&s;&s;ible. If it &s;hould be re|jected, or is &s;low in the operation, opening injections &s;hould be admini&s;tered every one or two hours. One do&s;e was &s;ometimes &s;ufficient to open the bow|els; &s;everal, however, were more frequently nece&s;|&s;ary, as the do&s;e was often thrown up by puking. In bilious fevers, there &s;eems to be a con&s;tant re|production of morbid bile; once clean&s;ing the bow|els, therefore, is not &s;ufficient; it will be proper to give a purge once a day as long as the fever la&s;ts. After one or two effectual do&s;es of jalap and calo|mel, as circum&s;tances require, other cathartics may be u&s;ed; &s;uch as Glauber's &s;alt, cremor tartar, rheubarb, &s;ena, manna, &amp;c. either &s;eparate or com|bined.</P>
<P>To a&s;&s;uage the great heat of this fever, cloths dipped in cold vinegar, or vinegar and water, ap|plied to the &s;urface of the body have been found to do great &s;ervice.</P>
<P>SOME have recommended flannel &s;hirts wet in this manner to be kept con&s;tantly applied. And
<PB N="33" REF="031881_0032_0FEF098F233C6E78">
it has been practi&s;ed by many phy&s;icians, particu|larly Dr. Trotter, of England with manife&s;t advan|tage. It certainly has a tendency to extract the heat from the body, which always, in proportion to its inten&s;ity, expands the teguments, thereby clo|&s;es the pores by increa&s;ing the den&s;ity; of cour&s;e per&s;piration cea&s;es.</P>
<P>THE pain of the head, very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing in this com|plaint, was greatly moderated by &s;imilar applications of cold water, or vinegar and water, to the pained part, neck and back.</P>
<P>DRINKS &s;hould be freely u&s;ed during the inflam|matory &s;tate of the di&s;order, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the operation of the phy&s;ic, and to le&s;&s;en the heat within. Al|mo&s;t any kind of tea is proper, &s;uch as mar&s;h mal|lows, balm, &amp;c. lemonade, tamarind water, toa&s;t in water, apple in water, may be drank with &s;afety and advantage.</P>
<P>FOOD of all kinds is extremely improper until the cri&s;is, unle&s;s it is unu&s;ually protracted; and even then it &s;hould be of the mo&s;t innocent kind, and very cautiou&s;ly admini&s;tered.</P>
<P>THE utmo&s;t pains &s;hould be taken with the pa|tient in re&s;pect to cleanline&s;s. Stools &s;hould be im|mediately removed; the linen well aired and &s;hift|ed as often as once a day. The chamber &s;hould be as large as can be had, and con&s;tantly ventilated.</P>
<P>BLEEDING in the fir&s;t &s;tage of the fever is &s;trong|ly recommended by Dr. Ru&s;h and others. It was
<PB N="34" REF="031881_0033_0FEF099224645860">
practi&s;ed by them with much apparent &s;ucce&s;s. But in Bo&s;ton, the la&s;t &s;ummer, it was not &s;o much re|lied on as a nece&s;&s;ary part of the cure: I believe be|cau&s;e the fever was le&s;s inflammatory. The jalap and calomel in large do&s;es was found, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, &s;ufficiently depleting to take off the excitement and irritability of the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>DR. Chi&s;holm, in his treatment of the fever at Grenada, found that bleeding was by no means ad|mi&s;&s;ible, and different antiphlogi&s;tics were ineffectu|al. His whole dependence was upon mercury, which he gave in pills, compo&s;ed of five grains of calomel, two of antimonial powder, and one of opium. This was repeated to the &s;ame extent, eight times in twenty-four hours. The propriety of this practice was ju&s;tified by the &s;ucce&s;s, for if &s;alivation was &s;peedily rai&s;ed, the danger was removed and the patient recovered.</P>
<P>NEXT to calomel in this form Dr. C. reckons vitriolic aether the mo&s;t beneficial. He gave it in the following manner: a tea&s;poonful in half a wine gla&s;s full of cold water. After this the patient was kept undi&s;turbed for two hours, when the do&s;e was repeated; and, in this manner, it was continued every two or three hours, till the &s;pa&s;m of the &s;tomach was entirely overcome. Given as above he found it extremely grateful to the patient, and that thir&s;t, nau&s;ea, and oppre&s;&s;ion often fled be|fore it.</P>

SHOULD the fever change, in con&s;equence of the exce&s;&s;ive &s;timulus of the morbid mia&s;ma, from the inflammatory or &s;ynochus type, and become typhoid, then the tonic and &s;timulating plan mu&s;t be pur|&s;ued. The &s;igns of this change are the lo&s;s of voice; tremulous motion of the tongue, or putting it out; the patient muttering to him&s;elf; catching at the bed-clothes, &s;ighing, weeping, and &s;ometimes laughing; difficult deglutition; paraly&s;is of the &s;phincter mu&s;cles; tremors; convul&s;ions; &s;yncope on being rai&s;ed upright; gangrene of bli&s;tered parts; profu&s;e diarrhoea; dark coloured urine; eye-balls fixed and &s;unk; the countenance &s;hrunk, lengthened, gha&s;tly, and di&s;coloured; in&s;ide of the mouth and tongue black and parched; deafne&s;s, or hearing very acute; the jaw fallen; immobility of the joints; watchfulne&s;s or con&s;tant &s;leep; heav|ing of the brea&s;t; rattling of the throat; pul&s;e felt only at intervals.</P>

they recover force to with&s;tand the di&s;ea&s;e: Or, let the &s;timulus of the di&s;ea&s;e act till the con&s;titu|tion, from the power of habit, can adapt it&s;elf to the peculiar nature of the &s;timulus, and thereby e&s;cape de&s;truction.</P>

<P>DR.

<P>HE ob&s;erved, 1<HI>&s;tly,</HI> That when the di&s;ea&s;e had entered a dwelling, avoiding the chamber of the &s;ick, prevented the infection. 2<HI>dly,</HI> That merely entering the chamber of the &s;ick, without approach|ing near to the di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;on, never communica|ted infection. 3<HI>dly,</HI> That approaching &s;o near the di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;on as to be &s;en&s;ible of the foetor of his breath, or of the peculiar &s;mell which is always emitted from the bodies of the &s;ick, or touching the bed clothes on which he lays, generally occa|&s;ioned nau&s;ea, &s;light rigors, and often head-ach, at the moment, and &s;ome hours afterwards, produced the di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf. 4<HI>thly,</HI> That actual contact, &s;o that the per&s;pired fluid of the &s;ick per&s;on might adhere to the hands, &amp;c. of the healthy per&s;on, more certainly produced the di&s;ea&s;e. 5<HI>thly,</HI> That touching the wearing apparel of a per&s;on actually di&s;ea&s;ed, or who had ju&s;t recovered from the di&s;ea&s;e,

&s;eems to be, that the di&s;ea&s;es ari&s;ing from the ex|halations of dead animal and &s;ome vegetable &s;ub|&s;tances are not putrid; not that the <HI>principle</HI> of pu|trefaction is <HI>not putrefactive;</HI> not again, that &s;epton is anti&s;eptic.

A putrefactive proce&s;s taking place in the contained parts of the living body except among the contents of the alimentary canal, is incompatible with life more than a few minutes. Putrefaction is a re&s;olu|tion of an organic body into its elementary atoms or into new compounds.

They not only do not putrefy the mu&s;|cles, but, in the common acceptation of the term, they retard putrefaction in other &s;ub&s;tances.

<PB N="44" REF="031881_0043_0FEF090C222063A0">
of it. And it may be laid down as a pretty broad fact, that &s;uch &s;ub&s;tances as are <HI>&s;eptic in their origin,</HI> are anti&s;eptic in their effects; and this from the na|ture of things."</P>
<P>I AM not &s;atisfied with this rea&s;oning, neither do I think it conclu&s;ive. "A putrefactive proce&s;s tak|ing place in the contained parts of the living body is incompatible with life for more than a few min|utes." The duration of life, while the putrefactive proce&s;s is going on in the body, is wholly according to the violence or rapidity of the proce&s;s. But if the putrefactive proce&s;s <HI>is</HI> &s;o incompatible with life, why reject the idea of <HI>putrid ferments</HI> in the ma&s;s of fluids? and why not call the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es &s;o &s;uddenly de&s;tructive to life, <HI>putrid?</HI> and why &s;ay, that the very principle or cau&s;e of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, which, from its &s;uppo&s;ed effects, is called &s;epton, is anti|&s;eptic?</P>
<P>WE grant that putrefaction is incompatible with life; and if it becomes general, the whole life is extingui&s;hed. But it may exi&s;t in a <HI>part</HI> of the bo|dy without a total and immediate extinction of the <HI>whole</HI> life. If this were not the ca&s;e, how came the idea of ulcerous putrefaction? It is allowed by all, that putrefaction may exi&s;t in the alimentary canal; perhaps always, in &s;ome degree. It is here, howev|er, that tho&s;e &s;ub&s;tances are &s;elected and taken up, which afterwards receive and retain life, and be|come a part of the body. This lacteal fluid, when there is a high degree of putrefaction in the <HI>prima</HI>

<HI>via,</HI> may in all probability become putrid, as it comes from the &s;ource of putrefaction: next the &s;e|rum; and &s;o on, till the whole ma&s;s of fluids be|comes corrupted, and life e&s;capes. Or, in the Doc|tor's own words, "Can it po&s;&s;ibly happen that pe&s;|tilential fluids &s;hall come in contact with the lungs, &s;kin and inte&s;tines, who&s;e &s;urfaces are thickly be&s;et with ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els; and that their noxious mat|ters &s;hall remain around the orifices of tho&s;e inhal|ing tubes for a very long time, and yet no atom or particle of them be taken in? Will not a portion of them be &s;ucked up by the lacteals from the in|te&s;tines, and by the lymphatics from the other ex|po&s;ed &s;urfaces of the body, and through their chan|nels be conveyed into the <HI>ma&s;s of blood?</HI> will not the <HI>blood,</HI> on receiving the&s;e <HI>foreign materials,</HI> a&s;&s;ume <HI>new qualities,</HI> and, as it travels the round of cir|culation, carry with it mi&s;chief and venom to the nervous &s;y&s;tem." p. 92. More than this I con|ceive was never under&s;tood by <HI>putrid ferments</HI> in the ma&s;s of fluids.</P>
<P>IN page 98, the Doctor &s;eems to admit the &s;ame idea (if po&s;&s;ible more fully, perhaps too much &s;o) for he there gives it as his opinion that "the &s;eptic gas does not produce death by its inflammatory ac|tion on the &s;uperficial mu&s;cles, but by its being mix|ed in a certain quantity with the <HI>blood;</HI> and after conver&s;ion to &s;eptous or &s;eptic acid, by conjunction with oxygen in circulating through the lungs, STIM|ULATING THE HEART TO DEATH, and utterly de&s;troying <HI>all</HI> the irritability of that mu&s;cle." Great|er

phenomena were never expected or known from the mo&s;t rapid putrefaction in its mo&s;t violent &s;tage; and all this the Doctor allows is done within the ve&s;&s;els of the circulating fluid. Fir&s;t the &s;eptic gas is converted into &s;eptous or &s;eptic acid, and then the deletereous effect is not by an inflammatory ac|tion on the &s;uperficial mu&s;cles, but by STIMULAT|ING THE HEART'S MUSCLES TO DEATH! This, it is ob&s;erved in the &s;ame page, can be done in the cour&s;e of half a minute!</P>
<P>HE ob&s;erves further, "that it mu&s;t not be im|agined, that, after pe&s;tilential venom is inhaled into the <HI>blood-ve&s;&s;els,</HI> death will in all ca&s;es be the con&s;e|quence. The offending matter may be carried from the body through the <HI>excretory</HI> outlets; or it may circulate a long time with the other <HI>fluids,</HI> and &s;o <HI>&s;ea&s;on</HI> both the <HI>ve&s;&s;els and the heart</HI> to its action, that after a while, <HI>they,</HI> like the <HI>external parts, will grow in&s;en&s;ible to its &s;timulus, and no longer have their mo|tions di&s;turbed by it."</HI>&mdash;How can Dr. Mitchill deny the exi&s;tence of putrid ferments in the ma&s;s of flu|ids, after &s;aying all this?</P>
<P>BUT I do not fully under&s;tand, how it is that the offending matter <HI>&s;ea&s;ons</HI> both the ve&s;&s;els and the heart to its actions, when ju&s;t before it killed them both!</P>
<P>WE grant that the life of a part, which has been de&s;troyed by deleterious &s;timuli or putrefaction, may be re&s;tored or renewed by the application of congenial matter, and ab&s;tracting the offending cau&s;e;

but otherwi&s;e the interior organization will be de|ranged, and the whole life de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>I HOLD it as a truth that there is no life but in &s;ome form;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>AN eminent Swedi&s;h author, to who&s;e writings I acknowledge my|&s;elf indebted for the ground of &s;ome other ob&s;ervations made in this work, rea&s;ons thus: Not only animal and vegetable life have their pe|culiar forms, but al&s;o &s;piritual exi&s;tences; even thoughts and affections have their appropriate and di&s;tinctive forms. The&s;e latter, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> thoughts and affections, are commonly but unintelligibly denominated ab&s;tract things, when in fact they are no more ab&s;tracted from their appropri|ate, &s;piritual, or &s;ub&s;tantial forms, than vi&s;ion is ab&s;tracted from its or|gan the eye, or hearing from its organ the ear. But the&s;e forms, how|ever, have nothing of gro&s;s materiality in them, therefore are not di&s;|cerned by bodily &s;ight. But it may be a&s;ked, what is affection and what is thought, in their &s;ub&s;tantiate forms or &s;ubjects. A &s;atisfactory an&s;wer may be deduced from all and every thing in the body, where there are many vi&s;cera, each fixed in its particular &s;ituation, and which operate their functions by changes and variations of their &s;tate and form. That the vi&s;cera are &s;everally employed in their re&s;pective op|erations, is well known; the &s;tomach in operating its functions, and &s;o the inte&s;tines, the kidneys, the liver, the pancreas, and &s;pleen in theirs; and likewi&s;e the heart and lungs, each in its re&s;pective office: and all the&s;e motions are operated only intrin&s;ically or within them&s;elves, and to be moved intrin&s;ically is to operate by variations of &s;tate and form. Hence it may appear, that the purely organic forms or &s;ub&s;tances of the mind are of a &s;imilar nature, only with this difference, that the opera|tions of the organic &s;ub&s;tances of the body are natural, and tho&s;e of the organic forms of the mind &s;piritual, and that both of the&s;e act as one by corre&s;pondences. There can be no ocular demon&s;tration of the changes and variations of &s;tate and form in the organic &s;ub&s;tances of the mind, which are affections, but yet they may be &s;een as it were in a gla&s;s, by the changes and variations of the &s;tate of the lungs in &s;peaking and &s;inging, there being a corre&s;pondence, ina&s;much as the &s;ound of the voice in &s;peaking and &s;inging, and al&s;o the articulations of &s;ound, which are words in &s;peech, and the modulations of the voice in &s;inging, are effected by the lungs; &s;ound corre&s;ponds to affection, and &s;peech to thought; they are al&s;o produced thereby, and this is done by changes and variations of the &s;tate and form of the organic &s;ub&s;tances of the lungs, and from the lungs by the trachea or wind-pipe in the larynx and glottis, and afterwards in the tongue, and la&s;tly in the mouth and lips. The fir&s;t changes and variations of the &s;tate and form of &s;ound are produced in the lungs, the &s;econd in the trachea and larynx, the third in the glottis by various openings of its orifice, the fourth in the tongue by its various applications to the palate and teeth, the fifth in the lips by di&s;po&s;ing them in various forms: Hence it may appear, that the mere changes and variations of the &s;tate of organic forms, &s;ucce&s;&s;ive|ly continued, produce &s;ounds and the articulations thereof, which are &s;peech and &s;inging. Now, fora&s;much as &s;ound and &s;peech are produced from no other &s;ource than from the affections and thoughts of the mind (for from the latter the former exi&s;t, and never without them) it is evi|dent that the affections of the will are changes and variations of the purely organic &s;ub&s;tances of the mind, and that the thoughts of the un|der&s;tanding are changes and variations of the form of their &s;ub&s;tances; &s;imilar to what hath ju&s;t been in&s;tanced in the lungs.</P>
<P>FORASMUCH as affections and thoughts are mere changes of the &s;tate of the forms of the mind, it follows, that the memory is nothing el&s;e but the permanent &s;tate thereof; for all changes and variations of &s;tate in organic &s;ub&s;tances are of &s;uch a nature, that when once they become habitual they are permanent; thus the lungs are habituated to produce various &s;ounds in the trachea and to vary them in the glottis, to articu|late them in the tongue, and to modify them in the mouth, and when tho&s;e organs are once habituated to them, they are in them and can be reproduced. See treati&s;e on Divine Providence, No.279. Publi&s;hed by Thomas and Andrews at Bo&s;ton, 1796.</P>
<P>To me the above rea&s;oning is &s;atisfactory. Something, in a degree &s;imilar, may be &s;een in Dr. Darwin's Zoonomia, vol. 1&s;t &s;ect. 4 to 12. His ideas, however, are not <HI>new;</HI> but his experiments are original and ingenious, and his proofs more in detail.</P></NOTE> and the animal life of man has its <HI>pe|culiar</HI>

form; this form con&s;i&s;ts of almo&s;t an infini|tude of parts, all po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a <HI>vita propria,</HI> or a life peculiar to their functions, which is derived from the <HI>common</HI> life which re&s;ides in the <HI>&s;en&s;orium</HI> or brain; for the life of all the parts is <HI>one,</HI> as much as all the parts are one body. Now let any venomous &s;ub|&s;tance be applied to any one of the&s;e parts, and the <HI>whole life</HI> is affected from the injury done to the part; and this, becau&s;e the <HI>whole</HI> is connected with every
<PB N="49" REF="031881_0048_0FEF090474CFAB28">
part, and every part with the <HI>whole.</HI> This, howev|er, is greater or le&s;s in proportion as the part is con|nected either remotely or nearly with interior or central life. Thus, poi&s;ons applied directly to the heart, &s;oon de&s;troy its motions, and produce death; applied to the brain, the effect is &s;till more &s;udden. But poi&s;ons, however active, never can affect the&s;e organs, except through fluid media: I doubt wheth|er there is any perception by the nerves, but in this way. Now,</P>
<P>DEATH never happens, or in other words animal life never leaves its material form, until this form is impaired by having its more &s;ubtle and animate principles or materials perverted or corrupted; e&s;|pecially tho&s;e which re&s;ide in the brain and are de|rived from the <HI>blood</HI> or through this medium. This certainly is the ca&s;e with all malignant di&s;|ea&s;es. Nor does this idea differ widely from Dr. Mitchill's notion of <HI>putrid ferments</HI> or <HI>putrefaction,</HI> which he defines, "a re&s;olution of an organic body into its elementary atoms."</P>
<P>WHETHER <HI>&s;epton</HI> or <HI>&s;eptic acid</HI> really is the cau&s;e of malignant di&s;ea&s;es, is problematical; experiments and future ob&s;ervations have yet to decide. Neith|er the affirmative nor negative is yet clearly or &s;at|isfactorily proved.</P>
<P>I SUSPECT Dr. Mitchill has been led to adopt his opinion of the cau&s;e of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es mo&s;tly from <HI>appearances:</HI> Thus it is found that all tho&s;e
<PB N="50" REF="031881_0049_0FEF091A2895EC50">
&s;pots and &s;oils, where nitre is produced in greate&s;t abundance, are unhealthy, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Egypt, Per&s;ia, and the Ea&s;t-Indies. But it does not follow, that be|cau&s;e di&s;ea&s;es are connected with the &s;oil in which nitre is found, that it is, in any &s;hape or form, the cau&s;e of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es. Nitre is commonly thought to be the <HI>re&s;ult</HI> or <HI>re&s;iduum</HI> of putrefactions, and is very &s;eldom found in a vaporous or un&s;aturated &s;tate, in which it <HI>mu&s;t be</HI> when taken into the &s;y&s;|tem by cuticular ab&s;orbents, or inhaled by the lungs in re&s;piration. But I &s;hall be an&s;wered, that &s;epton or the radical of nitre is &s;aturated by <HI>oxygen</HI> or <HI>vital air,</HI> which is taken from the atmo&s;phere, and there|by made unhealthy. But this would make hydro|gen (inflammable air) the cau&s;e of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es; for then this gas would be in undue proportion.</P>
<P>SOME probable rea&s;on might be brought in &s;up|port of the opinion that oxygen or vital air, what|ever be the &s;ub&s;tance with which it is combined, may be highly injurious, if not the cau&s;e proximate of many di&s;ea&s;es, when in over proportion; although it is in other circum&s;tances undeniably the great &s;upporter of life and health. It is certain that it gives cau&s;ticity to every preparation that acts as &s;uch on the human &s;y&s;tem. Without oxy|gen there is no putrefaction, no change or wa&s;te of &s;ub&s;tance; no corro&s;ion, ru&s;t, or decay of metals or minerals.</P>
<P>GREEN peas, green corn, &amp;c. when gluttonou&s;ly eaten, have been known to produce a mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;|ing

<HI>diarrhoea;</HI> and not unfrequently a <HI>cholera mor|bus.</HI> The&s;e &s;ub&s;tances are &s;aid to contain much oxygen.</P>
<P>WHICH, therefore, of the above principles has the greate&s;t &s;hare in the production of di&s;ea&s;es, will not be decided, until &s;ome &s;tandard, or <HI>Ga&s;metre,</HI> &s;hall be invented, by which it can be known what is the peculiar &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere when they prevail.</P>
<P>IT is &s;omewhat &s;ingular that the &s;ame principles, which by phy&s;icians in America is con&s;idered as the cau&s;e of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es, in Europe is ex|tolled as a &s;overeign remedy for their cure and prevention.</P>
<P>BUT more directly to the point in que&s;tion.&mdash;By &s;ome phy&s;icians it has been &s;trenuou&s;ly contend|ed, and with much ingenuity of rea&s;oning, that the fever of Philadelphia, New-York and Bo&s;ton had its <HI>origin</HI> in tho&s;e places. Others &s;ay that it origi|nated from <HI>fomes</HI> of foreign import.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame cau&s;es mu&s;t every where produce the &s;ame effects; and the &s;ame noxious &s;ub&s;tances in one place will produce the &s;ame di&s;orders as in an|other, all other circum&s;tances being the &s;ame.</P>
<P>THAT there may be, in either of the above men|tioned capitals, &s;uch a peculiar &s;tate of the atmo&s;|phere, or &s;uch a combination of noxious &s;ub&s;tances as will give ri&s;e to contagious di&s;ea&s;es, cannot be

di&s;puted. But it is within the &s;outhern or middle latitudes that the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es mo&s;t commonly have their origin. It is here that we find material quali|ties in a more naked and uncombined &s;tate, con&s;e|quently more powerfully active. Here putrefaction is &s;udden, and vegetation rapid. Here al&s;o is the region of elementary contention and violence; hur|ricanes, tornadoes, &s;ulphureous explo&s;ions, volca|noes, and earthquakes. Every &s;pecies of tropical wind has its peculiar di&s;ea&s;es, the Mon&s;oons, Har|mattan, Samiel, &amp;c. The winds of the&s;e regions va|ry their terrors; &s;ometimes involving all things in a &s;uffocating heat; &s;ometimes mixing all the ele|ments of fire, air, water, earth together; &s;ometimes with a momentary &s;wiftne&s;s pa&s;&s;ing over the face of the country, and de&s;troying all things in their pa&s;|&s;age.</P>
<P>AT Minorca and Gibraltar the winds which at times blow there from the interior of the country are very de&s;tructive, and at the Falkland I&s;lands an extraordinary wind is felt, occa&s;ionally, &s;o bla&s;ting as to cut the herbage down, equal to the raging of fire; the leaves are parched and crumbled to du&s;t. So at Goree, on the river Senegal, there is an ea&s;t|erly wind from the inland parts, with which tho&s;e who are &s;uddenly met by it in the face are &s;corched, as by a bla&s;t from a furnace.</P>
<P>BUT beyond all others in its dreadful effects, is the <HI>Samiel,</HI> or mortifying wind, of the de&s;erts near Bagdad. The camels, either by in&s;tinct or experi|ence,
<PB N="53" REF="031881_0052_0FEF0912780B1F48">
have notice of its approach, and are &s;o well aware of it, that they are &s;aid to make an unu&s;ual noi&s;e, and cover up their no&s;es in the &s;and. To e&s;cape its effects, travellers throw them&s;elves as clo&s;e as po&s;&s;ible to the ground, and wait till it has pa&s;&s;ed by, which is commonly in a few minutes. As &s;oon as they, who have life, dare to ri&s;e again, they exam|ine how it fares with their companions, by pluck|ing at their arms or legs; for if they are de&s;troyed by the wind, their limbs are ab&s;olutely mortified, and will come a&s;under. See Adams's Philo&s;ophi|cal Lectures.</P>
<P>In northern latitudes the atmo&s;phere is uniform|ly temperate and neutral; and if there are malig|nant di&s;ea&s;es, here originated, it mu&s;t be more in con&s;equence of idlene&s;s, neglect of cleanline&s;s, in|ternal and external, or &s;ome moral default, than of &s;ituation.</P>
<P>All this being agreeable to fact, the opinion that the mia&s;ma of malignant di&s;ea&s;es, more e&s;pecially the one of which we have treated, is imported from &s;ome &s;ultry climate, &s;eems mo&s;t probable.</P>
<P>FEW capitals, perhaps none, are more heathfully &s;ituated than Bo&s;ton. It is on a penin&s;ula, and con|&s;tantly ventilated on all &s;ides by water breezes. The &s;treets almo&s;t all are &s;o much inclined as to be wa&s;hed and clean&s;ed by every &s;hower. None&mdash;or very few places where filth can collect and &s;tagnate without great neglect of &s;cavenger duty. On the

we&s;t &s;ide is a large common of 20 acres or more extent covered with verdure, with a mall adjoining: A &s;pot more beautiful and recreative is not found in any country. A walk here may well be called a healthful luxury.</P>
<P>AN elegant State-hou&s;e, and other rich buildings; the &s;urrounding back country, with its hills and vales; the intervening waters, and other agreeable objects which diver&s;ify the pro&s;pect, all unite to ren|der this place extremely delightful.</P>
<P>THUS favourably circum&s;tanced, to what mu&s;t it be owing, &s;hould Bo&s;ton be again vi&s;ited with con|tagious malady? No doubt to &s;treet filth and other impurities which adulterate and de&s;troy the healthy qualities of the air, and render it a fit vehicle for the circulation and exten&s;ion of the pe&s;ts of di&s;|ea&s;es, here originated, or, introduced from &s;outh|ern climates.</P>
