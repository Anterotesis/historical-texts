<HEAD>The following is the account that ALEXANDER WHITE gave of him&s;elf to a per&s;on who vi&s;ited him, a &s;hort time before his death.</HEAD>
<P>THAT he was born in Ireland; had not been favoured with a religious education. &mdash;That he early gave him&s;elf up to a &s;ea-faring life.&mdash;Had never been guilty of any vices but &s;uch as are common to &s;ailors.&mdash;That he had enjoyed a good degree of reputation, and had been employed both as a mate and ma&s;ter of a ve&s;&s;el; in which &s;tations he had conducted him&s;elf in &s;uch a manner, as to obtain the ap|probation of his employers.&mdash;That he had fallen in love with a young woman of &s;ome family and property (who&s;e name he prudent|ly cho&s;e to conceal) but that whenever he thought of his own poverty, he felt mortified. &mdash;That in his PRIDE, the horrid temptation that proved his di&s;grace and ruin, and that co&s;t an innocent man his life, took ri&s;e.&mdash;That he had the promi&s;e of a mate's birth on board a ve&s;&s;el then gone to the We&s;t-Indies:&mdash;And that as her time of arrival was uncertain, he concluded to &s;tep on board the &s;chooner in which he committed the murder, that he might pa&s;s away the time, and do &s;ome little matter for him&s;elf.&mdash;That when he was off Long-I&s;land, and never before&punc; did the temptation

to kill the Captain and a pa&s;&s;enger, &s;eize him. He thought with him&s;elf that if he could kill tho&s;e two men, who were all the people on board, him&s;elf excepted, and po&s;&s;e&s;s their pro|perty, he &s;hould be able to look the young woman and her friends in the face.&mdash;He was a&s;ked, Whether he was not &s;hocked at the idea of murder?&mdash;No, replied he, I was as fixed and determined as it was po&s;&s;ible to be, 'till I had done it.&mdash;How did you ac|compli&s;h it? With a &s;igh and tears in his eyes he an&s;wered, I knocked him over board.&mdash; Did you kill him with the blow, or did he drown? I believe he drowned, &s;aid he.&mdash; &mdash;How did you feel when you had killed him? &mdash;My determination was, replied he, to kill the pa&s;&s;enger, and then po&s;&s;e&s;s the ve&s;&s;el.&mdash; What prevented you putting your purpo&s;e into execution?&mdash;As &s;oon as the pa&s;&s;enger began to &s;truggle with me, I found my&s;elf, &s;aid he, as feeble as a child, and he bound me with ea&s;e.&mdash;What were your feelings after you found your&s;elf confined?&mdash;I feared, &s;aid he, that I &s;hould lo&s;e my life for it: but I formed a &s;tory that would have &s;aved me, provided I had abode by it: which was this that the man who bound me was the murderer: and as there were but two of us on board who could &s;ay it was not &s;o?&mdash;Why &s;hould the pa&s;&s;en|ger's word be taken before mine?&mdash;How could a jury on the trial, determine which of us was guilty?</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="018886_0004_0FA82DC7063A6BE0">In this &s;tate of mind he was when he fir&s;t arrived in Plymouth goal; as appears by the following extract of a letter written by the Rev. Mr. Robbins of Plymouth to the Rev. Mr. Stillman.&mdash;"With re&s;pect to White's &s;tate of mind when he fir&s;t arrived here, he appear|ed to be extremely &s;tupid; ob&s;tinately, and with great pertinacity denying the whole af|fair of the murder, with wicked and frequent appeals to heaven. I perceived no traces of knowledge, or the &s;en&s;e of the things of God and religion in him.&mdash;I verily think he was exceedingly ignorant, and which al&s;o accords with his account of his manner of education."</P>
<P>In this ignorant and &s;tupid condition he confe&s;&s;ed that he remained, 'till a certain per|&s;on vi&s;ited him, and put &s;ome plain and mo&s;t important que&s;tions to him; which God was plea&s;ed &s;o to impre&s;s on his mind, that he became alarmed with a &s;en&s;e of his &s;ins in general, and the crime of murder in particu|lar to &s;uch a degree, that he could no longer re&s;t in his then pre&s;ent &s;ituation.</P>

<HEAD>An extract from Alexander White's papers, written by him&s;elf, while impri&s;oned in Plymouth goal, on a charge of Murder, Sept. 5, 1784. Taken from the originals, as follows.</HEAD>
<P>"I Will proceed to a&s;&s;ure you, that all that is &s;et forth here, is the truth, and nothing but the truth, and what I have experienced of late.</P>
<P>"Some days after I came to Plymouth, there came a particular per&s;on to me, and en|quired into the &s;tate of my &s;oul, and whether I thought I was fit to depart this life or not. I an&s;wered, that I could not tell, but I hoped that I was, and if I was not, that God would prepare me for it, and in particular a&s;ked if I had pa&s;&s;ed the great change of conver&s;ion? I did not under&s;tand what the meaning of that was. But when I came to con&s;ider the words that our Savior had expre&s;&s;ed to Nico|demus, John iii. chapter, 3d and 5th ver&s;es. "Verily, I &s;ay unto you, except a man be born again, he cannot enter into the king|dom of God," the&s;e words pierced my very heart, and I could not get over it. I &s;trove many times to bani&s;h tho&s;e thoughts from troubling my mind, but it was all in vain; I could not help thinking of my danger of hell. It was almo&s;t as bitter as death to me to think that I was &s;o near hell. But God opened my eyes to &s;ee there was no doubt
<PB N="7" REF="018886_0006_0FA82DC8852473B8">
that mu&s;t be my reward, if I died in the &s;tate I was in. I made it my bu&s;ine&s;s to look over the law of God, and I found that it required perfect obedience upon pain of eternal dam|nation. This increa&s;ed my mi&s;ery, and cau&s;|ed me to wi&s;h I never had been born. I found my heart was hardened in &s;in, and I could not for&s;ake it. Then I made it my &s;tudy to &s;earch into my heart&mdash;but, alas, the more I &s;aw of it, the more it encrea&s;ed my mi&s;ery. I found there was nothing in my heart but hypocri&s;y and deceitfulne&s;s. O! is this my heart! that I once thought was true to God and man!&mdash; I was affraid to look into it any further. I was affraid to tru&s;t in my heart. Oh how I felt! I have many times prayed to God to give me a new heart. But alas, I found that my prayers were all from a deceitful and from a bad heart. I often went to God with the Bible in my hand, and pointing my finger to the words where he promi&s;ed to take away the &s;tony heart, and give a heart of fle&s;h, I begged that he would make his word good to me.&mdash; But what grieved me was, I could not be EAR|NEST in prayer to God. I was expecting every day, I &s;hould grow better. But alas, the longer I lived I grew the wor&s;e, and more hardened. It was remarked in Mr. Wil&s;on's writings, that if I &s;lighted the free offer of Chri&s;t, how Turks, Jews and Pagans would unbraid me forever. This wounded my very heart and &s;oul, to think I &s;hould be on the
<PB N="8" REF="018886_0007_0FA82DCAD3542E60">
&s;ame cla&s;s with tho&s;e folks. I found many times I was ready to &s;tart back to my old hope, and that I had as good die with a fal&s;e hope, as to die in de&s;pair. O, I felt the heart of an infidel, and was affraid to look up to heaven, for fear that God &s;hould pour out his wrath, and con&s;ume me in a moment. For &s;ometimes I thought that the law of God was too &s;trict for any creature to abound in all things in it. It requires perfect obe|dience in all things. How can this be? I was born in &s;in, and mu&s;t I be puni&s;hed with everla&s;ting damnation for that &s;in? Can this be right? But when I come to think, that the Son of God died to an&s;wer the demands of this law, I was greatly &s;hocked and confound|ed. I thought it mu&s;t be right, or not believe the &s;criptures. I &s;eemed as if I was lo&s;t. I knew not what to do. It &s;eemed to give me a little comfort to think that others had been in the &s;ame extremity, and got relief. Though I had but little thought that I &s;hould get any relief or de&s;erved any. I found I was weak and feeble, in fle&s;h and &s;pirit. My thoughts was [were] always wandering. I knew not what to do. I really found my&s;elf on the brink of that di&s;mal and dark pit of de&s;truction, that there was nothing that was good in me, nor ever to be expected of me. But when I come to think of the words of our Saviour, that "<HI>he came to &s;eek and to &s;ave that which was lo&s;t,</HI>" but I feared I was not one of his flock. O
<PB N="9" REF="018886_0008_0FA82DCBABD38738">
this fear terrified my very heart and &s;oul.&mdash; On a certain night as I lay on my bed, bewail|ing my mi&s;erable condition, I was ready to yield that all the laws of God was [were] right and ju&s;t. But I found an inclination to quar|rel with God for charging me with original &s;in, which I thought I was not guilty of. But I thought, that if <HI>all</HI> the law was right, that this mu&s;t be al&s;o right. Oh how I felt, when I found I was condemned by the law of God, &s;elf-condemned, and my mouth &s;topped in all things, and I become guilty before an angry Judge. I &s;eemed as if I was lo&s;t in a barren wilderne&s;s in a dark, &s;tormy night, and had tried many paths, but could not find the right. I &s;eemed helple&s;s, heart broken, and condemn|ed, &s;eeing my&s;elf helple&s;s, without the lea&s;t &s;park of merit in all my life, I found, that ne|ce&s;&s;ity mu&s;t cau&s;e me to yield my&s;elf into the hands of God, and wait for his plea&s;ure. If he plea&s;ed to have mercy on me, that it was more than I de&s;erved. I had not long yielded my&s;elf into the hands of God, when I had a glorious view of the excellency of the divine perfections of a mo&s;t holy and merciful God. Next came in view the mo&s;t glorious &s;weet|ne&s;s of Chri&s;t's per&s;on and his un&s;peakable love towards human &s;ouls. And the heavenly &s;weetne&s;s of the love my &s;oul bore towards him and to all his perfections, that &s;o over|whelmed the &s;oul with the mo&s;t perfect joy and plea&s;ure imaginable, that I remained
<PB N="10" REF="018886_0009_0FA82DCC4B0BF508">
powerle&s;s for &s;ome time, in this glorious &s;weetne&s;s of &s;oul, that &s;o over come me with joy, that I &s;tretched forth my arms to receive my Savior into my heart, and &s;eemed as if the heavenly beams of glorious light &s;hined upon my &s;oul with &s;uch &s;weetne&s;s, that it is too much for me to attempt to mention. Next, came in view, a clear &s;en&s;e of the holine&s;s and amiablene&s;s of the go&s;pel, and all its perfecti|ons, and the infinite ju&s;tice and glory that proceeded from it, in every degree. The divine perfection, holine&s;s, ju&s;tice and good|ne&s;s of the divine law of God&mdash;it was impo&s;|&s;ible for my heart and &s;oul to avoid loving it in every degree. O I thought, if I was con|demned by it, I wi&s;hed for all heaven and all the earth to prai&s;e and adore it forever and ever. If I am de&s;troyed, it is ju&s;t, by the law of God. When I come to &s;ee that Chri&s;t &s;tood with open arms to receive the vile&s;t and chiefe&s;t breakers of this holy law, Oh how it increa&s;ed my love! The &s;oul being &s;trongly drawn to God and to Chri&s;t, and to the holine&s;s of their perfections, that it &s;eemed as if the &s;oul would depart from the body and a&s;cend into heaven. When I thought the object that I loved &s;o much, died for my &s;ake, O how it increa&s;ed my love! And when I looked back to my former &s;inful life, and &s;ee how I had abu&s;ed his free gift of grace, I mortally abhorred my proceedings, and reflected on my abominable &s;pent life in mi&s;ery and darkne&s;s of &s;oul.</P>

<HEAD>Further extracts from Alexander White's pa|pers&mdash;written to a friend while in Plymouth goal.</HEAD>
<P>"I will inform you of &s;ome of the mo&s;t par|ticular of my feelings, &s;ince I pa&s;&s;ed through tho&s;e glorious tokens of the workings of Al|mighty Power in this deceitful heart, and this immortal &s;oul.&mdash;I have mentioned to you the exerci&s;es of joys, when my &s;oul was illu+minated with that marvellous light which &s;hi|ned with the brighte&s;t beams imaginable in my heart; and which &s;et the whole &s;pirit and even body in a kind of heavenly tran&s;port, with the effects of that con&s;olation, whil&s;t I enjoyed that happine&s;s of &s;oul&mdash;which conti|nued for &s;everal hours&mdash;and indeed for &s;ome days, but not to &s;uch a great degree. My tongue could not find expre&s;&s;ions to glorify the great Worker of this excellent, precious and glorious work in &s;uch a wicked &s;inner. It &s;eemed to me, as if I could &s;carcely wi&s;h to enjoy &s;uch a happine&s;s, when I came to a re|flection on my abominable &s;pent life, and &s;ee the evil nature of &s;in, and the &s;overeign, great Being it is committed again&s;t. I cannot &s;ay that it was on account of the puni&s;hment that was threatened again&s;t it, &s;o much but what grieved me was&mdash;&s;eeing I had &s;o much abu&s;ed all the offers of the go&s;pel, and &s;lighted all the works of his divine power&mdash;and that I had been an enemy to him&mdash;hated him and all his ways. The devil can do no more than he has power
<PB N="12" REF="018886_0011_0FA82DCE0ECC3540">
to do, and I have done all that lay in my power; yea I exerted all my &s;trength and pow|er, with the greate&s;t vigor again&s;t heaven, and did the greate&s;t piece of &s;ervice to &s;atan, that lay in my power, and if I had more power, I &s;hould not have been backward to exert it. Which cau&s;ed me to think, that it was almo&s;t too much for me to expect &s;uch a favour from my enemy, whom I have abu&s;ed &s;o much, and befriended his adver&s;ary. It cau&s;ed me to think, that I had no right to any ble&s;&s;ing, that he could be&s;tow on &s;uch an unworthy member of &s;atan's diabolical, rebellious, bloodthir&s;ty train.&mdash;Oh, if Chri&s;t had not interceeded, could ever my eyes have looked to heaven for mercy, or ever expected any thing but the puni&s;hment that the wrath of God could i&s;&s;ue again&s;t &s;uch an offender and breaker of his holy law!&mdash;</P>
<P>Whil&s;t I enjoyed the&s;e heavenly ble&s;&s;ings, I &s;hould have been rejoiced to &s;ee the me&s;&s;en|ger of God come, and &s;ay, <HI>Prepare for death!</HI> I &s;hould made an&s;wer, <HI>I was all ready</HI> to an|&s;wer his demand.</P>
<P>Sometime after this, great fears entered my mind, knowing the deceitfulne&s;s of my heart. I found a great darkne&s;s of mind and oppre&s;|&s;ion of &s;pirits, which cau&s;ed great thoughts of unbelief to ri&s;e from my wicked heart, and cau&s;ed a great many &s;inful thoughts in my mind. Sometimes I would reflect on my&s;elf for having any doubt of the works of God,
<PB N="13" REF="018886_0012_0FA82DD1E1449618">
which I found &s;o clearly performed in my &s;oul. But all this would not &s;atisfy my di&s;con&s;olate mind, in any re&s;pect. All this di&s;content|ment &s;eemed different from what I had expe|rienced before. For now, I enjoyed &s;trong hope in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and I am convinced now that he is both able and willing to &s;ave the chiefe&s;t of &s;inners, if they are willing to be &s;aved and to accept of him as a Savior. Tho&s;e thoughts cau&s;ed me to be more attentive to prayer than I ever had been before. And af|ter continuing &s;ometime in this &s;ad condition, I found that God gave me a more clear view of his excellency, in a great many things than I ever had before. And confirmed the truth of all his &s;upreme power, and the freene&s;s of his divine grace and mercy towards rebellious &s;inners&mdash;which gave me a full a&s;&s;urance that he had be&s;towed his ble&s;&s;ing on me, without any manner of doubt&mdash;which cau&s;ed great con&s;olation in my &s;oul, and &s;piritually &s;treng|thened me, and increa&s;ed my love towards Je&s;us Chri&s;t and all his perfections, when I had &s;een his kindne&s;s towards me, who had been &s;uch a faithful &s;ervant of the devil and &s;uch an enemy to God and all his holy laws. &mdash;Job was a man of great patience. But what was that when compared to the patience of God? For had he not un&s;peakable patience, would he not con&s;ume us in our wickedne&s;s, and de&s;troy us without mercy! Would he not pour out his wrath and &s;ink us into eternal
<PB N="14" REF="018886_0013_0FA82DD2E92F7500">
damnation and unredeemable mi&s;ery?&mdash;But ble&s;&s;ed be his holy name, he waits with pati|ence, while we are running our race of wicked|ne&s;s, and then he convinces us of his ability to &s;ave&mdash;and of our own inability. He &s;hows us that we are helple&s;s and hopele&s;s, and unle&s;s he interpo&s;es, we are mi&s;erable and undone forever.&mdash;Oftentimes it has cau&s;ed me to won|der how pre&s;umptuous &s;inners dare have the a&s;&s;urance to affront and abu&s;e him before his eyes, who &s;eeth all things and knoweth the &s;ecrets of all hearts. How can we expect to e&s;cape his righteous judgment&mdash;and if not found in Chri&s;t, his eternal puni&s;hment here|after.&mdash;If any &s;inner is doubtful of the abi|lity and power of God, and of his obligation to him, how ju&s;t and right would it be for him to &s;how his ability, and make him know his power by puni&s;hing of him. Our thoughts will be but a poor excu&s;e before God at that great day that is a coming.</P>

<SALUTE>"Dear friend,</SALUTE>
<P>"You reque&s;t me, in your la&s;t letter, to &s;end you a particular account of the workings of my heart &s;ince I have condemned my&s;elf, by mak|ing an open confe&s;&s;ion of my abominable &s;in
<PB N="18" REF="018886_0017_0FA82DD5599963F8">
which I have committed again&s;t God and my own &s;oul. I do not reflect on my conduct (in confe&s;&s;ing the crime) ble&s;&s;ed be God that my hope is grounded on the &s;ure foundation that is laid in Zion. My anchor is within the veil, and 'tis utterly impo&s;&s;ible for it to be removed by the hands of man, or the ingenuity of de|vils&mdash;Nothing can remove my hope. Altho' the time draws near and death approaches me, God al&s;o draws near, and &s;tifles the pangs of death and gives me an over coming triumph over the grave. Ble&s;&s;ed be God, I have the privilege of going to meeting, and have the advice of &s;undry faithful mini&s;ters of the go&s;|pel. And ble&s;&s;ed be God that I am very well &s;upplied with the nece&s;&s;aries of life.&mdash;I have not time nor opportunity to write to all my friends with you, now&mdash;the time draws near that I am to be no more&mdash;yet what remains of my heart that is not engaged with God, I leave with them, and I hope they have but a &s;mall &s;hare.</P>
<P>"My dear friend, there are two malefactors along with me, who are under &s;entence of death &mdash;and when this comes to hand I, with their con&s;ent, would &s;olicit you for your prayers in their behalf.&mdash;My feeble hand, bound with <HI>cold iron</HI> will not allow me to write &s;o long a letter as I would wi&s;h. So I conclude, and remain your dying friend,</P>

<P>&rindx; BY the preceding papers the reader is informed what the &s;tate of <HI>White</HI>'s mind was when he was fir&s;t impri&s;oned at Plymouth, viz. <HI>igno|rant of God and religion</HI>:&mdash;The means that God made u&s;e of to awa|ken his attention to his eternal inte|re&s;t, viz. The conver&s;ation of a per|&s;on who vi&s;ited him from a tender concern for his &s;alvation.&mdash;The view he had of his &s;inful condition, which reduced him for many days nearly to a &s;tate of de&s;pair&mdash;The manner in which he was delivered from his fears of de&s;erved wrath, viz. By a manife&s;tation of the di|vine glory, and of the grace of the go&s;pel to the chief of &s;inners, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t; which was followed with the warme&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of love

to God, to Chri&s;t and the divine law. To which may be added, That his tempers and life ever after his profe&s;&s;ed acquaintance with religi|on, were &s;uch as became the go&s;pel. For the truth of which an appeal may &s;afely be made to all who knew him in his confinement both at Ply|mouth and Cambridge.</P>
<P>The Honourable the Court, be|fore whom he was arraigned know with what humility and frankne&s;s he behaved on his trial. At once con|fe&s;&s;ing his horrid crime, and refu&s;|ing to have any one to plead for him; &s;aying, That he was the murderer, that he de&s;erved to die, and was willing to die. And though brought forth the &s;econd day before the Court

he declared his guilt as before, and condemned him&s;elf, becau&s;e, &s;aid he, I dare not tell a lie to &s;ave my life, knowing that I &s;hould thereby of|fend God.</P>
<P>He maintained a &s;urpri&s;ing tran|quility of mind to the la&s;t minute, and took his leave of the Reverend Gentleman who kindly attended him to the place of execution, with a countenance that be&s;poke his inward peace in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, though un&s;peak|ably horrid was his crime, may he not charitably be viewed as a brand plucked out of the burning? or as a monument of free and &s;overeign grace? Let that God be magnifi|ed, who is gracious and merciful, &s;low to anger, and plenteous in pardon!</P>
