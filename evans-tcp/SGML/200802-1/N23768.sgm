<P>RESPECTING the &s;ource from which the following letters have been drawn, and the grounds on which the reader is expected to re&s;t his be|lief of their authenticity, it may be &s;ufficient to inform him (and, for the truth of the a&s;&s;ertion, to appeal to His Excellency Thomas Pinckney, the Ameri|can Mini&s;ter Plenipotentiary) that permi&s;&s;ion was obtained from the proper authority, to tran&s;cribe, from the original papers pre&s;erved in the Secretary of State's office in Philadelphia, the&s;e and &s;undry other authentic documents relating to the conte&s;t between the colonies and the mother country, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Letters from the Commanders of the continental forces, and other per&s;ons em|ployed in the public &s;ervice,&mdash;intercepted letters from Briti&s;h Officers and o|ther adherents to the royal cau&s;e,&mdash;Communications from the Governors, Con|ventions, and Committees of the &s;everal American States,&mdash;Di&s;patches from Agents and Commi&s;&s;ioners,&mdash;In&s;tructions,&mdash;Reports of Committees of Congre&s;s,&mdash;parts of the Secret Journals hitherto unpubli&s;hed,&mdash;and various other pieces elucidative of the events which led to and finally e&s;tabli&s;hed American Inde|pendence.</P>
<P>That permi&s;&s;ion was granted early in the year 1792, and immediate advan|tage was taken of the indulgence; though, from various circum&s;tances, of lit|tle con&s;equence to the reader to know, the publication has been &s;o long delay|ed. Even at this late period, the editor contents him&s;elf with laying before the public but a part of the collection,&mdash;intending, if the&s;e volumes meet with a favorable reception, to continue the publication, and pre&s;ent his readers with a variety of intere&s;ting pieces penned by the leaders and principal agents in the American Revolution, and tending to throw light on many important tran&s;actions that have hitherto been either enveloped in total darkne&s;s, or, at be&s;t but ob&s;curely perceived and imperfectly under&s;tood.</P>
<P>Some parts of the&s;e letters may perhaps appear too full of minutiae to in|tere&s;t that cla&s;s of readers, who, unaccu&s;tomed to enter into the inve&s;tigation of cau&s;es or con&s;equences, delight only in recitals of battles, &s;ieges, or other &s;triking occurrences, which con&s;titute the more prominent features of hi&s;tory. But to the rea&s;oning philo&s;ophic reader, who wi&s;hes to explore the &s;ecret &s;prings of action,&mdash;to trace events to their remote and latent cau&s;es,&mdash;to di&s;cover and examine the &s;ubordinate and collateral circum&s;tances (oft trifling in appear|ance, and generally overlooked by the vulgar eye) which, in the &s;truggles of contending nations, give a preponderancy to the one or the other &s;cale,&mdash;tho&s;e minute details will, it is pre&s;umed, be far from unacceptable, as furni&s;hing him with that &s;pecies of information, upon which alone he can venture to ground a deci&s;ive opinion, and which he might el&s;ewhere &s;eek in vain.</P>
<P>The inclo&s;ures, frequently referred to in the&s;e volumes, would &s;till further contribute to &s;et every circum&s;tance in a clearer and &s;tronger light; and it was the editor's original intention that they &s;hould have accompanied the letters to which they re&s;pectively belong. Ob&s;tacles however, <HI>at pre&s;ent</HI> in|&s;urmountable, &s;tand in the way of their immediate publication: but, when the&s;e are removed, the papers alluded to &s;hall make their appearance in form of an Appendix,&mdash;&s;uch parts of them at lea&s;t, as are of a curious and intere&s;ting nature.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="031423_0003_0FEC4A5615F621A0">
Meanwhile the reader will ob&s;erve that it was deemed as yet premature to publi&s;h certain pa&s;&s;ages of the&s;e letters: &s;ome omi&s;&s;ions have of cour&s;e taken place, which are every where pointed out by a&s;teri&s;ks, and which will be &s;up|plied at a proper &s;ea&s;on, probably not far di&s;tant.&mdash;On the other hand, in per|haps half a dozen in&s;tances, a &s;ingle word has been hazarded on conjecture, to fill up a cha&s;m, where either the original or the copy happened to be torn or defaced; in which ca&s;es the &s;upplemental words are inclo&s;ed within crotchets and printed in Italic.&mdash;A few entire letters, moreover, as appears by reference made to them in &s;ub&s;equent ones, are here wanted to complete the chain of corre&s;pondence. The&s;e the editor can give no account of, as the originals ap|pear to have been lo&s;t from the files of offi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">.</P>
<P>About a dozen letters, written by the general's &s;ecretary,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr. R. H.

Mor|ris, e&s;quire, in the department of finance.

<P>THE rain on friday afternoon and &s;aturday,&mdash;the advice of &s;everal gentlemen of the Jer&s;eys and this city, by no means to cro&s;s Hud&s;on's river at the lower ferry,&mdash;and &s;ome other cir|cum&s;tances too trivial to mention, prevented my arrival at this place, until the afternoon of this day.</P>
<P>In the morning, after giving general Schuyler &s;uch orders, as, from the re&s;ult of my inquiry into matters here, appear ne|ce&s;&s;ary, I &s;hall &s;et out on my journey to the camp at Bo&s;ton, and &s;hall proceed with all the di&s;patch in my power. Powder is &s;o e&s;&s;ential an article, that I cannot help again repeating the nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;upply. The camp at Bo&s;ton, from the be&s;t ac|count I can get from thence, is but very poorly &s;upplied. At this place, they have &s;carce any. How they are provided at general Woo&s;ter's camp, I have not been able yet to learn.</P>
<P>Governor Tryon is arrived, and general Schuyler directed to advi&s;e you of the line of conduct he moves in. I fear it will not be very favorable to the American cau&s;e.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>UPON my arrival hdere this afternoon, I was informed that an expre&s;s was in town, from the provincial camp in Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts-Bay; and having &s;een, among the papers in his po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, a letter directed to you as pre&s;ident of the Congre&s;s, I have taken the liberty to open it. I was induced to take that li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">erty, by &s;everal gentlemen of New-York, who were anxious to know the particulars of the affair of the &s;eventeenth in&s;tant, and agreeable to the orders of many members of the Congre&s;s, who judged it nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould avail my&s;elf of the be&s;t information in the cour&s;e of my journey.</P>
<P>You will find, &s;ir, by that letter, a great want of powder in the provincial army, which I &s;incerely hope the Congre&s;s will &s;up|ply as &s;peedily and as effectually as in their power. One thou|&s;and pounds in weight were &s;ent to the camp at Cambridge, three days ago, from this city; which has left this place almo&s;t de&s;titute of that nece&s;&s;ary article: there being at this time from the be&s;t information, not more than four barrels of powder in the city of New-York.</P>
<P>I propo&s;e to &s;et off for the provincial camp to-morrow, and will u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch to join the forces there.</P>
<P>Plea&s;e to make my compliments to the gentlemen of the Con|gre&s;s; and believe me to be, &s;ir, your obliged friend and hum|ble &s;ervant.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I ARRIVED &s;afe at this place on the third in&s;tant, after a journey attended with a good deal of fatigue, and retarded by nece&s;&s;ary attentions to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive civilities which accompa|nied me on my whole route.</P>
<P>Upon my arrival, I immediately vi&s;ited the &s;everal po&s;ts oc|cupied by our troops; and, as &s;oon as the weather permitted, reconnoitred tho&s;e of the enemy. I found the latter &s;trongly intrenched on Bunker's hill, about a mile from Charle&s;town, and advanced about half a mile from the place of the late ac|tion, with their centries extended about one hundred and fifty yards on this &s;ide of the narrowe&s;t part of the neck leading
<PB N="7" REF="031423_0006_0FEC4A105D103750">
from this place to Charle&s;town. Three floating batteries lie in My&s;tick river near their camp, and one twenty-gun &s;hip below the ferry place between Bo&s;ton and Charle&s;town. They have al&s;o a battery on Cop&s;e-hill, on the Bo&s;ton &s;ide, which much annoyed our troops in the late attack. Upon the neck, they have al&s;o deeply intrenched and fortified. Their advanced guards, till la&s;t &s;aturday morning, occupied Brown's hou&s;es, a|bout a mile from Roxbury meeting-hou&s;e, and twenty rod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> from their lines: but, at that time, a party from general Tho|mas's camp &s;urpri&s;ed the guard, drove them in, and burned the hou&s;es. The bulk of their army, commanded by general Howe, lies on Bunker's-hill, and the remainder on Roxbury-neck, ex|cept the light-hor&s;e, and a few men in the town of Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>On our &s;ide, we have thrown up intrenchments on Winter and Pro&s;pect hills,&mdash;the enemy's camp in full view, at the di&s;|tance of a little more than a mile. Such intermediate points as would admit a landing, I have &s;ince my arrival taken care to &s;trengthen, down to Sewal's farm, where a &s;trong intrench|ment has been thrown up. At Roxbury, general Thomas has thrown up a &s;trong work on the hill, about two hundred yards above the meeting-hou&s;e; which, with the brokenne&s;s of the ground, and a great number of rocks, has made that pa&s;s very &s;ecure. The troops rai&s;ed in New-Hamp&s;hire, with a regiment from Rhode-I&s;land, occupy Winter-hill; a part of tho&s;e from Connecticut, under general Putnam, are on Pro&s;pect-hill. The troops in this town are entirely of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts: the re|mainder of the Rhode-I&s;land-men are at Sewal's farm. Two regiments of Connecticut, and nine of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, are at Roxbury. The re&s;idue of the army, to the number of about &s;even hundred, are po&s;ted in &s;everal &s;mall towns along the coa&s;t, to prevent the depredations of the enemy.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I think my&s;elf authori&s;ed to &s;ay, that, con|&s;idering the great extent of line and the nature of the ground, we are as well &s;ecured, as could be expected in &s;o &s;hort a time, and under the di&s;advantages we labor. The&s;e con&s;i&s;t in a want of engineers, to con&s;truct proper works and direct the men, a wan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of tools, and a &s;ufficient number of men to man the works in ca&s;e of an attack. You will ob&s;erve, by the proceedings of the council of war which I have the honor to inclo&s;e, that it is our unanimous opinion to hold and defend the&s;e works as long as po&s;&s;ible. The di&s;couragement it would give the men, and its contrary effects on the mini&s;terial troops, thus to abandon our encampment in their face, formed with &s;o much labor,&mdash;
<PB N="8" REF="031423_0007_0FEC4B5542CD0698">
added to the certain de&s;truction of a con&s;iderable and valuable extent of country, and our uncertainty of finding a place in all re&s;pects &s;o capable of making a &s;tand,&mdash;are leading rea&s;ons for this determination. At the &s;ame time we are very &s;en&s;ible of the difficulties which attend the defence of lines of &s;o great ex|tent, and the dangers which may en&s;ue from &s;uch a divi&s;ion of the army.</P>
<P>My earne&s;t wi&s;h to comply with the in&s;tructions of the Con|gre&s;s, in making an early and complete return of the &s;tate of the army, has led into an involuntary delay in addre&s;&s;ing you; which has given me much concern. Having given orders for this purpo&s;e immediately on my arrival,&mdash;and unappri&s;ed of the imperfect obedience which had been paid to tho&s;e of the like nature from general Ward, I was led from day to day to expect they would come in, and therefore detained the me&s;&s;enger.&mdash;They are not now &s;o complete as I could wi&s;h: but much al|lowance is to be made for inexperience in forms, and a liberty which had been taken (not given) on this &s;ubject. The&s;e rea|&s;ons, I flatter my&s;elf, will no longer exi&s;t; and, of con&s;equence, more regularity and exactne&s;s will in future prevail. This, with a nece&s;&s;ary attention to the lines, the movements of the mini&s;te|rial troops, and our immediate &s;ecurity, mu&s;t be my apology, which I beg you to lay before Congre&s;s with the utmo&s;t duty and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>We labor under great di&s;advantages for want of tents; for, though they have been helped out by a collection of now u&s;e|le&s;s &s;ails from the &s;ea-port towns, the number is far &s;hort of our nece&s;&s;ities. The colleges and hou&s;es of this town are nece&s;&s;a|rily occupied by the troops; which affords another rea&s;on for keeping our pre&s;ent &s;ituation. But I mo&s;t &s;incerely wi&s;h the whole army was properly provided to take the field, as I am well a&s;&s;ured that (be&s;ides greater expedition and activity in ca&s;e of alarm) it would highly conduce to health and di&s;cipline. As materials are not to be had here, I would beg leave to recom|mend the procuring a farther &s;upply from Philadelphia as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be extremely deficient in gratitude as well as ju&s;tice, if I did not take the fir&s;t opportunity to acknowledge the rea|dine&s;s and attention, which the provincial Congre&s;s and different committees have &s;hewn, to make every thing as convenient and agreeable as po&s;&s;ible. But there is a vital and inherent princi|ple of delay, incompatible with military &s;ervice, in tran&s;acting bu&s;ine&s;s through &s;uch numerous and different channels. I e&s;|teem it therefore my duty to repre&s;ent the inconvenience which
<PB N="9" REF="031423_0008_0FEC4A2E86D8A7B0">
mu&s;t unavoidably en&s;ue from a dependence on a number of per|&s;ons for &s;upplies; and &s;ubmit it to the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s, whether the public &s;ervice will not be be&s;t promoted by ap|pointing a commi&s;&s;ary-general for the&s;e purpo&s;es. We have a &s;triking in&s;tance of the preference of &s;uch a mode, in the e&s;tab|li&s;hment of Connecticut, as their troops are extremely well pro|vided under the direction of Mr. Trumbull, and he has at dif|ferent times a&s;&s;i&s;ted others with various articles. Should my &s;entiments happily coincide with tho&s;e of your honors on this &s;ubject, I beg leave to recommend Mr. Trumbull as a very proper per&s;on for this department. In the arrangement of troops collected under &s;uch circum&s;tances, and upon the &s;pur of immediate nece&s;&s;ity, &s;everal appointments are omitted, which appear to be indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary for the good government of the army&mdash;particularly a quarter-ma&s;ter-general, a commi&s;|&s;ary of mu&s;ters, and a commi&s;&s;ary of artillery. The&s;e I mu&s;t earne&s;tly recommend to the notice and provi&s;ion of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>I find my&s;elf already much embarra&s;&s;ed, for want of a milita|ry che&s;t. The&s;e embarra&s;&s;ments will increa&s;e every day: I mu&s;t therefore reque&s;t that money may be forwarded as &s;oon as po&s;|&s;ible. The want of this mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary article will (I fear) pro|duce great inconveniencies, if not prevented by an early atten|tion. I find the army in general, and the troops rai&s;ed in Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts in particular, very deficient in nece&s;&s;ary clothing.&mdash;Upon enquiry, there appears no probability of obtaining any &s;upplies in this quarter; and, on the be&s;t con&s;ideration of this matter I am able to form, I am of opinion that a number of hunting &s;hirts (not le&s;s than ten thou&s;and) would in a great de|gree remove this difficulty, in the cheape&s;t and quicke&s;t manner. I know nothing, in a &s;peculative view, more trivial, yet, if put in practice, would have a happier tendency to unite the men, and aboli&s;h tho&s;e provincial di&s;tinctions which lead to jealou&s;y and di&s;&s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>In a forme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> part of this letter, I mentioned the want of en|gineers. I can hardly expre&s;s the di&s;appointment I have ex|perienced on this &s;ubject,&mdash;the &s;kill of tho&s;e we have being very imperfect, and confined to the mere manual exerci&s;e of cannon; whereas the war in which we are engaged requires a knowledge, comprehending the duties of the field, and fortification. If a|ny per&s;ons thus qualified are to be found in the &s;outhern colo|nies, it would be of great public &s;ervice to forward them with all expedition.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="031423_0009_0FEC4A38A7ECC3A0">
Upon the article of ammunition, I mu&s;t re-echo my former complaints on this &s;ubject. We are &s;o exceedingly de&s;titute, that our artillery will be of little u&s;e, without a &s;upply both large and &s;ea&s;onable. What we have mu&s;t be re&s;erved for the &s;mall|arms, and that managed with the utmo&s;t frugality. * * *</P>
<P>The &s;tate of the army you will find a&s;certained with tolera|ble preci&s;ion in the returns which accompany this letter. Up|on finding the number of men to fall &s;o far &s;hort of the e&s;tab|li&s;hment, and below all expectation, I immediately called a council of the general officers, who&s;e opinion (as to the mode of filling up the regiments, and providing for the pre&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t exi|gency) I have the honor of inclo&s;ing, together with the be&s;t judgment we are able to form of the mini&s;terial troops. From the number of boys, de&s;erters, and negroes, that have been en|li&s;ted in the troops of this province, I entertain &s;ome doubts whether the number required can be rai&s;ed here: and all the general officers agree that no dependence can be put upon the militia, for a continuance in camp, or regularity and di&s;cipline during the &s;hort time they may &s;tay. This unhappy and de|voted province has been &s;o long in a &s;tate of anarchy, and the yoke * * * * * been laid &s;o heavily on it, that great allowances are to be made for troops rai&s;ed under &s;uch circum|&s;tances. The deficiency of numbers, di&s;cipline, and &s;tores, can only lead to this conclu&s;ion&mdash;that their &s;pirit has exceeded their &s;trength. But at the &s;ame time I would humbly &s;ubmit to the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s the propriety of making &s;ome further provi&s;ion of men from the other colonies. If the&s;e regiments &s;hould be completed to their e&s;tabli&s;hment, the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e unfit for duty on account of their age and character would occa&s;ion a con&s;iderable reduction; and, at all events, they have been enli&s;ted upon &s;uch terms, that they may be di&s;band|ed when other troops arrive. But &s;hould my apprehen&s;ions be reali&s;ed, and the regiments here not filled up, the public cau&s;e would &s;uffer by an ab&s;olute dependence upon &s;o doubtful an event, unle&s;s &s;ome provi&s;ion is made again&s;t &s;uch a di&s;appoint|ment.</P>
<P>It requires no military &s;kill, to judge of the difficulty of in|troducing proper di&s;cipline and &s;ubordination into an army, while we have the enemy in view, and are in daily expectation of an attack: but it is of &s;o much importance, that every ef|fort will be made, which time and circum&s;tances will admit. In the mean time, I have a &s;incere plea&s;ure in ob&s;erving that there are materials for a good army,&mdash;a great number of able-bodied
<PB N="11" REF="031423_0010_0FEC4A3D90571718">
men, active, zealous in the cau&s;e, and of unque&s;tionable courage.</P>
<P>I am now, &s;ir, to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of the twenty-eighth, inclo&s;ing the re&s;olutions of Congre&s;s, of the twenty-&s;eventh ultimo, and a copy of a letter from the commit|tee of Albany; to all which I &s;hall pay due attention.</P>
<P>Generals Gates and Sullivan have both arrived in good health.</P>
<P>My be&s;t abilities are at all times devoted to the &s;ervice of my country; but I feel the weight, importance, and variety of my pre&s;ent duties too &s;en&s;ibly, not to wi&s;h a more immediate and frequent communication with the Congre&s;s. I fear it may often happen in the cour&s;e of our pre&s;ent operations, that I &s;hall need that a&s;&s;i&s;tance and direction from them, which time and di&s;tance will not allow me to receive.</P>
<P>Since writing the above, I have al&s;o to acknowledge your fa|vor of the fourth in&s;tant by Fe&s;&s;enden, and the receipt of the commi&s;&s;ions and articles of war. The former are yet eight hun|dred &s;hort of the number required. This deficiency you will plea&s;e to &s;upply as &s;oon as you conveniently can.

<P>SINCE I did my&s;elf the honor of addre&s;&s;ing you on the tenth in&s;tant, nothing material has happened in the camp. From &s;ome authentic and later advices of the &s;tate of the mini&s;terial troops, and the great inconvenience of calling in the militia in the mid&s;t of harve&s;t, I have been induced for the pre&s;ent to wave it:&mdash;but in the mean time recruiting parties have been &s;ent throughout this province, to fill up the regiments to the e|&s;tabli&s;hment of the provincial Congre&s;s. At the &s;ame time that I received the&s;e advices, I al&s;o obtained a li&s;t of the officers of the enemy killed and wounded in the late battle at Charle&s;town, which I take this opportunity to inclo&s;e.</P>
<P>The great &s;carcity of fre&s;h provi&s;ions in their army has led me to take every precaution to prevent a &s;upply: for this pur|po&s;e, I have ordered all the cattle and &s;heep to be drawn from the low grounds and farms within their reach. A detachment from general Thomas's camp, on wedne&s;day night, went over to Long-I&s;land, and brought from thence twenty cattle and a number of &s;heep, with about fifteen laborers who had been put on by a Mr. Ray Thomas, to cut the hay, &amp;c. By &s;ome acci|dent they omitted burning the hay, and returned the next day at noon to complete it; which they effected, amid&s;t the firing of the &s;hipping, with the lo&s;s of one man killed and another wounded.</P>
<P>La&s;t evening al&s;o a party of the Connecticut men &s;trolled down on the mar&s;h at Roxbury, and fired upon a centry; which drew on a heavy fire from the enemy's lines and floating batte|ries, but attended with no other effect than the lo&s;s of one kill|ed by a &s;hot from the enemy's lines. In the man time, we are, on both &s;ides, continuing our works: but there has been no o|ther movement than what I have noticed above. I &s;hall endea|vour to give a regular and particular account of all tran&s;actions as they occur, which you will plea&s;e to lay before the honora|ble Congre&s;s. I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I did my&s;elf the honor of addre&s;&s;ing you the four|teenth in&s;tant, I have received advice from governor Trumbull, that the a&s;&s;embly of Connecticut had voted, and that they are now rai&s;ing, two regiments of &s;even hundred men each, in con|&s;equence of an application from the provincial Congre&s;s of Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts-Bay.
<PB N="13" REF="031423_0012_0FEC48AD2A93FE70">
The Rhode-I&s;land a&s;&s;embly has al&s;o made an augmentation for this purpo&s;e. The&s;e reinforcements, with the riflemen who are daily expected, and &s;uch recruits as may come in to fill up the regiments here, will, I apprehend, com|po&s;e an army &s;ufficiently &s;trong to oppo&s;e any force which may be brought again&s;t us at pre&s;ent. I am very &s;en&s;ible that the heavy expen&s;e, nece&s;&s;arily attendant upon this campaign, will call for the utmo&s;t frugality and care, and would therefore, if po&s;&s;ible, avoid enli&s;ting one unnece&s;&s;ary man. As this is the fir&s;t certain account of the de&s;tination of the&s;e new-rai&s;ed troops, I thought proper to communicate my &s;entiments as early as po&s;&s;ible, le&s;t the Congre&s;s &s;hould act upon my letter of the tenth, and rai&s;e troops in the &s;outhern colonies, which, in my pre&s;ent judgment may be di&s;pen&s;ed with.</P>
<P>For the&s;e eight days pa&s;t there have been no movements in either camp, of any con&s;equence. On our &s;ide we have conti|nued the works without any intermi&s;&s;ion; and they are now &s;o far advanced as to leave us little to apprehend on that &s;core. On the &s;ide of the enemy they have al&s;o been very indu&s;trious in fini&s;hing their lines, both on Bunker's-hill and Roxbury|neck. In this interval al&s;o, their tran&s;ports have arrived from New-York; and they have been employed in landing and &s;ta|tioning their men. I have been able to collect no certain ac|count of the numbers arrived: but the inclo&s;ed letter, wrote (though not &s;igned) by Mr. Sheriff Lee, and delivered me by captain Darby (who went expre&s;s with an account of the Lex|ington battle) will enable us to form a pretty accurate judg|ment. The increa&s;e of tents and men in the town of Bo&s;ton is very obvious; but all my accounts from thence agree that there is a great mortality, occa&s;ioned by the want of vegeta|bles and fre&s;h meat; and that their lo&s;s in the late battle at Charle&s;town (from the few recoveries of their wounded) is greater than at fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed. The condition of the inhabit|ants detained in Bo&s;ton is very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing: they are equally de&s;titute of the comfort of fre&s;h provi&s;ions; and many of them are &s;o reduced in their circum&s;tances, as to be unable to &s;up|ply them&s;elves with &s;alt. Such fi&s;h as the &s;oldiery leave, is their principal &s;upport. Added to all this, &s;uch &s;u&s;picion and jealou&s;y prevails, that they can &s;carcely &s;peak, or even look, without expo&s;ing them&s;elves to &s;ome &s;pecies of military execu|tion.</P>
<P>I have not been able, from any intelligence I have received, to form any certain judgment of the future operations of the enemy. Sometimes I have &s;u&s;pected an intention of detaching
<PB N="14" REF="031423_0013_0FEC4787106B1448">
a part of their army to &s;ome part of the coa&s;t, as they have been building a number of flat-bottomed boats, capable of holding two hundred men each. But, from their works, and the language held at Bo&s;ton, there is rea&s;on to think they ex|pect the attack from us, and are principally engaged in prepar|ing them&s;elves again&s;t it. I have ordered all the whale-boats along the coa&s;t to be collected: and &s;ome of them are employed every night to watch the motions of the enemy by water, &s;o as to guard as much as po&s;&s;ible again&s;t any &s;urpri&s;e. * * *</P>
<P>Next to the more immediate and pre&s;&s;ing duties of putting our lines in as &s;ecure a &s;tate as po&s;&s;ible, attending to the move|ments of the enemy, and gaining intelligence&mdash;my great con|cern is to e&s;tabli&s;h order, regularity, and di&s;cipline, without which, our numbers would embarra&s;s us, and, in ca&s;e of action, general confu&s;ion mu&s;t infallibly en&s;ue. In order to this, I propo&s;e to divide the army into three divi&s;ions:&mdash;at the head of each, will be a general officer:&mdash;the&s;e divi&s;ions to be again &s;ubdivided into brigades, under their re&s;pective brigadiers. But the difficulty ari&s;ing from the arrangement of the general officers, and waiting the further proceedings of the Congre&s;s on this &s;ubject, has much retarded my progre&s;s in this mo&s;t nece&s;|&s;ary work. I &s;hould be very happy to receive their final com|mands, as any determination would enable me to proceed in my plan. * * *</P>
<P>In addition to the officers mentioned in mine of the tenth in&s;tant, I would humbly propo&s;e that &s;ome provi&s;ion &s;hould be made for a judge-advocate, and provo&s;t-mar&s;hal. The nece&s;&s;i|ty of the fir&s;t appointment was &s;o great, that I was obliged to nominate Mr. Tudor, who was well recommended to me, and now executes the office under the expectation of receiving cap|tain's pay&mdash;an allowance (in my opinion) &s;carcely adequate to the &s;ervice, in new-rai&s;ed troops, where there are court-mar|tials every day. However, as that is the proportion in the regular army, and he is contented, there will be no nece&s;&s;ity of an addition.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t al&s;o renew my reque&s;t as to money, and the appoint|ment of a payma&s;ter. I have forebore urging matters of this nature, from my knowledge of the many important concerns which engage the attention of the Congre&s;s; but as I find my difficulties thicken every day, I make no doubt, &s;uitable regard will be paid to a nece&s;&s;ity of this kind. The inconvenience of borrowing &s;uch &s;ums as are con&s;tantly requi&s;ite mu&s;t be too plain for me to enlarge upon, and is a &s;ituation from which I &s;hould be very happy to be relieved.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="031423_0014_0FEC4A29EBE00A58">
Upon the experience I have had, and the be&s;t con&s;ideration of the appointment of the &s;everal officers of commi&s;&s;ary-gene|ral, mu&s;ter-ma&s;ter general, quarter ma&s;ter-general, pay ma&s;ter-general, and commi&s;&s;ary of artillery, I am clearly of opinion that they not only conduce to order, di&s;patch and di&s;cipline, but that it is a mea&s;ure of oeconomy. The delay, the wa&s;te, and unpuni&s;hable neglect of duty, ari&s;ing from the&s;e officers being in commi&s;&s;ion of &s;everal hands, evidently &s;how that the public expen&s;e mu&s;t be finally enhanced. I have experienced the want of the&s;e officers, in completing the returns of men, ammunition, and &s;tores. The latter are yet imperfect, from the number of hands in which they are di&s;per&s;ed. I have in|clo&s;ed the la&s;t weekly return, which is more accurate than the former; and hope in a little time we &s;hall be perfectly regular in this as well as &s;everal other nece&s;&s;ary branches of duty.</P>
<P>I have made inquiry into the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the ho&s;pital, and find it in a very un&s;ettled condition. There is no princi|pal director, nor any &s;ubordination among the &s;urgeons: of con&s;equence, di&s;putes and contentions have ari&s;en, and mu&s;t continue until it is reduced to &s;ome &s;y&s;tem. I could wi&s;h it was immediately taken into con&s;ideration, as the lives and health of both officers and men &s;o much depend upon a due regulation of this department. I have been particularly atten|tive to the lea&s;t &s;ymptoms of the &s;mall-pox; and hitherto we have been &s;o fortunate as to have every per&s;on removed &s;o &s;oon, as not only to prevent any communication, but any alarm or apprehen&s;ion it might give in the camp. We &s;hall continue the utmo&s;t vigilance again&s;t this mo&s;t dangerous enemy.</P>
<P>In an army properly organi&s;ed, there are &s;undry offices of an inferior kind, &s;uch as waggon-ma&s;ter, ma&s;ter carpenter, &amp;c. but I doubt whether my powers are &s;ufficiently exten&s;ive for &s;uch appointments. If it is thought proper to repo&s;e &s;uch a tru&s;t in me, I &s;hall be governed, in the di&s;charge of it, by a &s;trict regard to oeconomy and the public intere&s;t.</P>
<P>My in&s;tructions from the honorable Congre&s;s direct that no troops are to be di&s;banded without their expre&s;s direction, nor to be recruited to more than double the number of the enemy. Upon this &s;ubject I beg leave to repre&s;ent, that unle&s;s the re|giments in this province are more &s;ucce&s;sful in recruiting than I have rea&s;on to expect, a reduction of &s;ome of them will be highly nece&s;&s;ary, as the public is put to the whole expen&s;e of an e&s;tabli&s;hment of officers, while the real &s;trength of the regi|ment (which con&s;i&s;ts in the rank and file) is defective. In ca&s;e of &s;uch a reduction, doubtle&s;s &s;ome of the privates and all the
<PB N="16" REF="031423_0015_0FEC4A5843CD34A0">
officers would return home: but many of the former would go into the remaining regiments; and, having had &s;ome experi|ence, would fill them up with u&s;eful men. I &s;o plainly per|ceive the expen&s;e of this campaign will exceed any calculation hitherto made, that I am particularly anxious to &s;trike off eve|ry unnece&s;&s;ary charge. You will therefore, Sir, be plea&s;ed to favor me with explicit directions from the Congre&s;s, on the mode of this reduction (if it &s;hall appear nece&s;&s;ary) that no time may be lo&s;t when &s;uch nece&s;&s;ity appears.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday we had an account that the light-hou&s;e was on fire:&mdash;by whom, and under what orders, I have not yet learn|ed; but we have rea&s;on to believe it has been done by our ir|regulars.</P>
<P>You will plea&s;e to pre&s;ent me to the Congre&s;s, with the ut|mo&s;t duty and re&s;pect; and believe me to be, &amp;c.</P>

expre&s;s: but on tue&s;day three men-of-war and nine tran&s;ports &s;ailed out of Bo&s;ton harbor, and &s;tood a cour&s;e about E. S. E.</P>
<P>One Groves, who came out of Bo&s;ton the &s;ame evening in|formed the officer at one of the outpo&s;ts, that the tran&s;ports had on board &s;ix hundred men, and were bound to Block-I&s;|land, Fi&s;her's-I&s;land, and Long-I&s;land, to plunder them, and bring off what cattle they may find. The fellow returned a|gain into Bo&s;ton under &s;uch &s;u&s;picious circum&s;tances, that it has led me to doubt the truth of his intelligence.</P>
<P>A de&s;erter, who came in afterwards, informs me that it was given out in their camp, that they were either gone for Indians or fre&s;h provi&s;ions: and that each tran&s;port had but twenty men on board. Upon this intelligence, I immediately wrote to governor Cooke of Rhode-I&s;land, and to general Woo&s;ter, that they might take proper precautions for removing the cat|tle off tho&s;e i&s;lands and the coa&s;ts, and to prevent any &s;urpri&s;e. As we are confirmed, by every account, in the &s;carcity of fre&s;h provi&s;ions in the enemy's camp, and particularly by this de|&s;erter it is very probable this voyage may be only intended for a &s;upply: but as it may po&s;&s;ibly be otherwi&s;e, I thought it be&s;t to tran&s;mit the intelligence to the honorable Congre&s;s, that they may forward it to the &s;outhward, or take &s;uch other &s;teps as they may judge proper.</P>
<P>Since writing the above, three more de&s;erters have come out&mdash;which makes four in twenty-four hours. Their accounts corre&s;pond with tho&s;e of the fir&s;t who came out, and which I have related above.&mdash;I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of the twenty-fourth July, accompanied by two hundred and eighty four commi&s;&s;ions, which are yet much &s;hort of the nece&s;&s;ary number. I am much honored by the confidence repo&s;ed in me, of appointing the &s;everal officers recommended in mine of the tenth ultimo; and &s;hall endeavor to &s;elect &s;uch per&s;ons as are be&s;t qualified to fill the&s;e important po&s;ts. * * * *</P>
<P>In the renewal of the&s;e commi&s;&s;ions, &s;ome difficulties occur, in which I &s;hould be glad to know the plea&s;ure of the honora|ble Congre&s;s. The general officers of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts have regiments; tho&s;e of Connecticut have both regiments and com|panies; and the other field officers have companies each. From Rhode-I&s;land, the general officer has no regiment, but the field
<PB N="18" REF="031423_0017_0FEC48A962E814B8">
officers have companies: but I do not find that they have o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> expect pay, under more than one commi&s;&s;ion. Should the commi&s;&s;ions, now to be delivered, pur&s;ue the&s;e different e&s;|tabli&s;hments, there will be a di&s;tinction between general and field officers of the &s;ame rank. In order to put New-Hamp|&s;hire, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and Rhode-I&s;land, upon a line with Con|necticut, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;mi&s;s a number of officers in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of commi&s;&s;ions, without any fault of theirs. On the other hand, to bring the Connecticut generals and field offi|cers to the &s;ame &s;cale with the others, will add to the number of officers, and may be deemed incon&s;i&s;tent with the terms on which they entered into the &s;ervice, although you add nothing to the expen&s;e, except in the article of provi&s;ions. Upon the whole, it is a ca&s;e which I would wi&s;h the honorable Congre&s;s to con&s;ider and determine.</P>
<P>Colonel Gridley of this province, who is at the head of the artillery, has the rank of major-general from the provincial Congre&s;s. Will it be proper to renew his commi&s;&s;ion here in the &s;ame manner?&mdash;It is proper here to remark, that, in this ca&s;e, he will take rank of all the brigadiers-general, and even the majors-general, who&s;e commi&s;&s;ions are &s;ub&s;equent in date: and this can an&s;wer no good purpo&s;e, but may be productive of many bad con&s;equences.</P>
<P>The&s;e are matters of &s;ome importance: but I am embarra&s;&s;|ed with a difficulty of a &s;uperior kind. The e&s;timate, made in Congre&s;s, &s;uppo&s;ed all the regiments to be formed upon one e&s;|tabli&s;hment; but they are different in different provinces, and even vary in the &s;ame province, in &s;ome particulars: In Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts, &s;ome regiments have ten companies, others eleven: the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the former is five hundred and ninety men, of|ficers included;&mdash;of the latter &s;ix hundred and forty-nine. The e&s;tabli&s;hment of Rhode-I&s;land and New Hamp&s;hire is five hundred and ninety to a regiment, officers included:&mdash;Connec|ticut has a thou&s;and men to a regiment. Should the Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts regiments be completed, with the new levies from Rhode-I&s;land and Connecticut, and the riflemen, the number will ex|ceed twenty-two thou&s;and. If they &s;hould not be completed,&mdash;as each regiment is fully officered, there will be a heavy ex|pen&s;e to the public, without an adequate &s;ervice. The reduc|tion of &s;ome of them &s;eems to be nece&s;&s;ary, and yet is a mat|ter of much delicacy, as we are &s;ituated. I mo&s;t earne&s;tly re|que&s;t it may be taken into immediate con&s;ideration, and the time and mode of doing it pointed out by the honorable Congre&s;s. By an e&s;timate I have made from the general return,&mdash;when
<PB N="19" REF="031423_0018_0FEC4A2827A97528">
the new levies arrive, and the regiments are completed, there will be twenty-four thou&s;and four hundred and fifty men on the pay and provi&s;ion of the United Colonies. Some of the re|cruiting officers, who have been out on that &s;ervice, have re|turned with very little &s;ucce&s;s; &s;o that we may &s;afely conclude, the number of two thou&s;and and &s;ixty-four, now wanting to complete, will rather increa&s;e than dimini&s;h. There are the regiments of artillery, con&s;i&s;ting of four hundred and ninety|three men, and one under colonel Sergeant (who has not receiv|ed any commi&s;&s;ion, although he had orders to rai&s;e a regiment, from the provincial Congre&s;s here) which are not included in the above e&s;timate. This la&s;t regiment con&s;i&s;ts of two hundred and thirty-four men by the la&s;t return; but a company has &s;ince joined.</P>
<P>By adverting to the reneral return, which I have the honor of inclo&s;ing (No. 1), it will be &s;een, what regiments are mo&s;t deficient.</P>
<P>If the Congre&s;s does not chu&s;e to point out the particular re|giments, but the provinces in wich the reduction is to be made, the &s;everal Congre&s;&s;es and A&s;&s;emblies may be the proper chan|nel to conduct this bu&s;ine&s;s, which I would al&s;o conceive the mo&s;t advi&s;able, from their better acquaintance with the merits, terms, and time of &s;ervice, of the re&s;pective officers. Reduc|ing &s;ome regiments, and, with the privates thereof, filling up others, would certainly be the be&s;t method of accompli&s;hing this work if it were practicable: but the experiment is danger|ous, as the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-men, under the privilege of chu&s;ing their own officers, do not conceive them&s;elves bound, if tho&s;e officers are di&s;banded.</P>
<P>As general Gage is making preparations for winter by con|tracting for quantities of coal, it will &s;ugge&s;t to us the proprie|ty of extending our views to that &s;ea&s;on. I have directed that &s;uch huts as have been lately made of boards &s;hould be done in &s;uch a manner, that, if nece&s;&s;ary, they may &s;erve for cover|ing during the winter. But I need not enlarge upon the va|riety of nece&s;&s;ities, &s;uch as clothing, fuel, &amp;c. (both exceed|ingly &s;carce, and difficult to be procured) which that &s;ea&s;on mu&s;t bring with it, if the army or any con&s;iderable part of it is to remain embodied.</P>
<P>From the inactivity of the enemy &s;ince the arrival of their whole reinforcement,&mdash;their continual addition to their lines,&mdash;and many other circum&s;tances,&mdash;I am inclined to think, that finding us &s;o well prepared to receive them, the plan of opera|tions is varied, and they mean, by regular approaches, to bom|bard

If they have not &s;ome &s;uch expectations, the i&s;&s;ue of which they are determined to wait, I cannot account for the delay, when their &s;trength is le&s;&s;ened every day by &s;ickne&s;s, de&s;ertions, and little &s;kirmi&s;hes.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e la&s;t we have had only two worthy of notice. Hav|ing &s;ome rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect they were extending their lines at Charle&s;town, I, la&s;t &s;aturday evening, ordered &s;ome of the ri|flemen down, to make a di&s;covery, or bring off a pri&s;oner. They were accidentally di&s;covered &s;ooner than they expected, by the guard coming to relieve, and obliged to fire upon them. We have rea&s;on to believe they killed &s;everal. They brought in two pri&s;oners, who&s;e account (confirmed by &s;ome other cir|cum&s;tances) removed my &s;u&s;picions in part. Since that time, we have, on each &s;ide, drawn in our centries, and there have been &s;cattering fires along the line. This evening we have heard of three captains who have been taken off by the rifle|men, and one killed by a cannot-&s;hot from Roxbury, be&s;ides &s;everal privates: but as the intelligence is not direct, I only mention it as a report which de&s;erves credit. The other hap|pened at the light-hou&s;e. A number of workmen having been &s;ent down to repair it, with a guard of twenty-two marines and a &s;ubaltern,&mdash;major Tupper, la&s;t monday morning about two o'clock, landed there with about three hundred men, attacked them, killed the officer and four privates: but being detained by the tide, in his return he was attacked by &s;everal boats; but he happily got through, with the lo&s;s of one man killed, and another wounded. The remainder of the mini&s;terial troops (three of whom are badly wounded) he brought off pri&s;oners, with ten tories, all of whom are on their way to Springfield-jail. The riflemen, in the&s;e &s;kirmi&s;hes, lo&s;t one man, who (we hear) is a pri&s;oner in Bo&s;ton-jail. The enemy, in return, en|deavored to &s;urpri&s;e our guard at Roxbury: but they, being appri&s;ed of it by a de&s;erter, had time to prepare for it: but by &s;ome negligence or mi&s;conduct in the officer of the guard, they burned the George tavern on the neck; and have every day &s;ince been cannonading us, from their lines, both at Roxbury and Charle&s;town, but with no other effect than the lo&s;s of two men. On our part, except &s;traggling fires from the &s;mall arms about the lines, which we endeavor to re&s;train, we have made little or no return.</P>

Our &s;ituation, in the article of powder, is much more alarm|ing than I had the mo&s;t di&s;tant idea of. Having de&s;ired a re|turn to be made out (on my arrival) of the ammunition, I found three hundred and three barrels and a half of powder mention|ed as in the &s;tore: but on ordering a new &s;upply of cartridges ye&s;terday, I was informed, to my very great a&s;toni&s;hment, that there was no more than thirty-&s;ix barrels of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts &s;tore, which, with the &s;tock of Rhode-I&s;land, New-Hamp&s;hire, and Connecticut, makes nine thou&s;and nine hundred and thirty|&s;even pounds,&mdash;not more than nine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ounds a man. As there had been no con&s;umption of powder &s;ince, that could in any de|gree account for &s;uch a deficiency, I was very particular in my inquiries, and found that the committee of &s;upplies, not being &s;ufficiently acquainted with the nature of a return, or mi&s;appre|hending my reque&s;t, &s;ent in an account of all the ammunition which had been collected by the province: &s;o that the report included not only what was in hand, but what had been &s;pent.</P>
<P>Upon di&s;covering this mi&s;take, I immediately went up to confer with the &s;peaker of the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, upon &s;ome mea&s;ures to obtain a &s;upply from the neighbouring town|&s;hips, in &s;uch a manner as might prevent our poverty being known; as it is a &s;ecret of too great con&s;equence to be divulg|ed in the general court, &s;ome individual of which might per|haps indi&s;creetly &s;uffer it to e&s;cape him, &s;o as to find its way to the enemy,&mdash;the con&s;equences of which are terrible even in idea. I &s;hall al&s;o write to the governors of Rhode-I&s;land and Connecticut, and the committee of &s;afety in New-Hamp&s;hire, on this &s;ubject, urging, in the mo&s;t forcible terms, the nece&s;&s;i|ty of an immediate &s;upply, if in their power. I need not en|large on our melancholy &s;ituation: it is &s;ufficient that the ex|i&s;tence of the army and the &s;alvation of the country depends upon &s;omething being done for our relief, both &s;peedy and ef|fectual, and that our &s;ituation be kept a profound &s;ecret.</P>
<P>In the inclo&s;ures, No. 2 and 3, I &s;end the allowance of pro|vi&s;ions, &amp;c. made by the provinces of Connecticut and Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts. The mode and quantity are different from what has fallen within my experience; and, I am confident, mu&s;t prove very wa&s;teful and expen&s;ive. If any alteration can be &s;afely made, (which, I much doubt) there might be a great &s;aving to the public.</P>
<P>A gentlemen of my family, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a de&s;erter who has &s;ome &s;kill in fortification, has by my direction &s;ketched out two draughts of our re&s;pective lines at Charle&s;town and Rox|bury,
<PB N="22" REF="031423_0021_0FEC4A1E0844E9B0">
which, with the explanations, will convey &s;ome idea of our &s;ituation, and, I hope, prove acceptable to the members of the honorable Congre&s;s. They are the inclo&s;ures, No. 4 and 5.</P>
<P>Since I had the honor of addre&s;&s;ing you la&s;t, I have been ap|plied to, by a committee of the general court, for a detachment of the army, to protect the inhabitants of the ea&s;tern parts of this province from &s;ome apprehended depredations on their coa&s;ts. I could have wi&s;hed to have complied with their re|que&s;t: but, after due con&s;ideration, and con&s;ulting the general officers, together with the members of Congre&s;s who are here, I thought it my duty to excu&s;e my&s;elf. The application and my an&s;wer are the inclo&s;ures, No. 6 and 7, which I hope will be approved by the honorable Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>Since I began this letter, the original, of which the inclo|&s;ure, No. 8, is a copy, fell into my hands. As the writer is a per&s;on of &s;ome note in Bo&s;ton, and it contains &s;ome advices of importance not mentioned by others, I thought proper to for|ward it as I received it. By comparing the hand-writing with another letter, it appears the writer is one Belcher Noyes, a per&s;on probably known to &s;ome of the gentlemen, delegates from this province, who can determine from his principles and character, what credit is due-to him.</P>
<P>The army is now formed into three grand divi&s;ions, under the command of the generals Ward, Lee, and Putnam:&mdash;each divi&s;ion into two brigades, con&s;i&s;ting of about &s;ix regiments each, commanded by generals Thomas and Spencer at Roxbury,&mdash;Heath at Cambridge,&mdash;Sullivan and Greene at Winter-hill. By this, you will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve, there is a deficiency of one brigadier-general, (occa&s;ioned by Mr. Pomroy's not acting un|der his commi&s;&s;ion) which I beg may be filled as &s;oon as po&s;&s;i|ble. I ob&s;erve the honorable Congre&s;s have al&s;o favored me with the appointment of three brigade-majors. I pre&s;ume they have or intend to appoint the re&s;t &s;oon, as they cannot be un|acquainted that one is nece&s;&s;ary to each brigade; and, in a new rai&s;ed army it will be an office of great duty and &s;ervice.</P>
<P>General Gage has at length liberated the people of Bo&s;ton, who land in numbers at Chel&s;ea every day. The terms on which the pa&s;&s;es are granted, as to money, effects, and provi&s;ions, cor|re&s;pond with Mr. Noyes' letter.</P>
<P>We have &s;everal reports that general Gage is di&s;mantling Ca&s;tle-William, and bringing all the cannon up to town: but,
<PB N="23" REF="031423_0022_0FEC4A18CDA915E8">
upon a very particular enquiry, accounts are &s;o various, that I cannot a&s;certain the truth of it. * * * *</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t in&s;tant, a chief of the Caghnawaga tribe, who lives about &s;ix miles from Montreal, came in here, accompa|nied by a colonel Bayley of Caho&s;s. His accounts of the tem|per and di&s;po&s;ition of the Indians are very favourable. He &s;ays they have been &s;trongly &s;olicited by governor Carleton to engage again&s;t us; but his nation is totally aver&s;e;&mdash;that threats, as well as entreaties, have been u&s;ed without effect;&mdash;that the Canadians are well-di&s;po&s;ed to the Engli&s;h colonies: and if any expedition is meditated again&s;t Canada, the Indians in that quarter will give all their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. I have endeavored to cheri&s;h the&s;e favorable di&s;po&s;itions, and have recommended to him to cultivate them on his return. What I have &s;aid, I enforced with a pre&s;ent, which I under&s;tood would be agreea|ble to him; as he is repre&s;ented to be a man of weight and con&s;equence in his own tribe, I flatter my&s;elf his vi&s;it will have a good effect. His account of general Carleton's force and &s;i|tuation at St. John's corre&s;pond with what we have already had from that quarter.</P>
<P>The acce&s;&s;ion of Georgia to the mea&s;ures of the Congre&s;s is a happy event, and mu&s;t give a &s;incere plea&s;ure to every friend of America.</P>

<P>I have this morning been alarmed with an information that two gentlemen from Philadelphia (Mr. Hitchbour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> and captain White), with letters for general Lee and my&s;elf, have been taken by captain Ay&s;cough at Rhode-I&s;land, the letters in|tercepted and &s;ent forward to Bo&s;ton,&mdash;with the bearers, as pri&s;oners; that the captain exulted much in the di&s;coveries he had made: and my informer (who was al&s;o in the boat, but relea&s;ed) under&s;tood them to the letters of con&s;equence. I have therefore di&s;patched the expre&s;s immediately back, though I had before re&s;olved to detain him till Fe&s;&s;enden's return. I &s;hall be anxious till I am relieved from the &s;u&s;pen&s;e I am in, as to the contents of tho&s;e letters.</P>
<P>It is exceedingly unfortunate that gentlemen &s;hould chu&s;e to travel the only road on which there is danger. Let the event of this be what it will, I hope it it will &s;erve as a general cau|tion again&s;t tru&s;ting any letters that way in future.</P>

<P>THE inclo&s;ed letter came under &s;uch a direction and cir|cum&s;tances, as led me to &s;uppo&s;e it contained &s;ome intere&s;ting advices, either re&s;pecting a &s;upply of powder, or the clothing lately taken at Philadelphia. I therefore took the liberty of breaking the &s;eal, for which I hope the &s;ervice and my motives will apologize.</P>
<P>As the filling up the place of vacant brigadier-general will probably be the fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s of the honorable Congre&s;s, I flatter my&s;elf it will not be deemed a&s;&s;uming, to mention, the names of two gentlemen who&s;e former &s;ervices, rank and age, may be thought worthy of attention on this occa&s;ion. The for|mer is colonel John Arm&s;trong, of Penn&s;ylvania: he &s;erved du|ring the la&s;t war, in mo&s;t of the campaigns to the &s;outhward; was honored with the command of the Penn&s;ylvania forces, and his general military conduct and &s;pirit much approved by all who &s;erved with him: be&s;ides which, his character was di&s;|tingui&s;hed by an enterpri&s;e again&s;t the Indians, which he plan|ned with great judgment, and executed with equal courage and &s;ucce&s;s. It was not till lately that I had rea&s;on to believe he would enter again on public &s;ervice; and it is now wholly un|&s;olicited and unknown on his part. The other gentlemen is co|lonel Fry, of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay. He entered into the &s;ervice as early as 1745, and ro&s;e through the different military ranks, in the &s;ucceeding wars, to that of colonel, until la&s;t June, when he was appointed major-general by the Congre&s;s of this pro|vince. From the&s;e circum&s;tances, together with the favorable report made to me of him, I pre&s;ume he &s;u&s;tained the character of a good officer, though I do not find it di&s;tingui&s;hed by any peculiar &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Either of the&s;e gentlemen, or any other whom the honorable Congre&s;s will plea&s;e to favor with this appointment, will be re|ceived by me with the utmo&s;t deference and re&s;pect.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="031423_0024_0FEC4A169A195DB0">
The late adjournment having made it impracticable to know the plea&s;ure of the Congre&s;s as to the appointment of brigade-majors, beyond the number of three which they were plea&s;ed to leave me,&mdash;and the &s;ervice not admitting of farther delay, I have continued the other three; which I hope their honors will not di&s;approve. The&s;e latter were recommended by the re&s;pec|tive corps to which they belong, as the propere&s;t per&s;ons for the&s;e offices, until farther direction, and have di&s;charged the du|ty ever &s;ince. They are the majors, Box, Scammel, and Sa|muel Brewer.</P>
<P>La&s;t &s;aturday night we took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a hill cno&s;iderably advanced beyond our former lines; which brought on a very heavy cannonade from Bunker's-hill, and afterwards a bombard|ment, which has been &s;ince kept up with little &s;pirit on their part, or damage on ours. The work having been continued ever &s;ince, is now &s;o advanced, and the men &s;o well covered, as to leave us under no apprehen&s;ions of much farther lo&s;s. In this affair, we had killed&mdash;one adjutant, one volunteer, and two privates. The &s;carcity of ammunition does not admit of our availing our&s;elves of the &s;ituation, as we otherwi&s;e might do: but this evil, I hope, will &s;oon be remedied, as I have been in|formed of the arrival of a large quantity at New-York, &s;ome at New-London, and more hourly expected at different places. I need not add to what I have already &s;aid on this &s;ubject.&mdash;Our late &s;upply was very &s;ea&s;onable, but far &s;hort of our nece&s;|&s;ities.</P>
<P>The late adjournment of the honorable Congre&s;s having been made before my letter of the fourth in&s;tant was received, I mu&s;t now beg leave to recal their attention to tho&s;e parts of it which re&s;pect the provi&s;ion for the winter, the reduction of the troops, the double commi&s;&s;ions under different e&s;tabli&s;hments, and co|lonel Gridley's appointment of major-general; in all which, I hope to be honored with their commands as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The advocate-general has &s;ent me a memorial re&s;pecting his &s;ervice, which I have the honor to inclo&s;e, (No. 1.) and from the variety and multiplicity of duty in a new army, as well as his regular &s;ervice and attendance, I am induced to recommend him to the farther notice of the honorable Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>The treatment of our officers, pri&s;oners at Bo&s;ton, induced me to write to general Gage on that &s;ubject. His an&s;wer and my reply I have the honor to lay before the Congre&s;s, in the inclo&s;ures No. 2, 3, 4; &s;ince which I have heard nothing from him.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been in daily expectation of being favored with the commands of the honorable Congre&s;s, on the &s;ubject of my two la&s;t letters. The &s;ea&s;on now advances &s;o fa&s;t, that I cannot any longer defer laying before them &s;uch farther mea|&s;ures as require their immediate attention, and in which I wait their direction,</P>
<P>The mode in which the pre&s;ent army has been collected has occa&s;ioned &s;ome difficulty in procuring the &s;ub&s;cription of both officers and &s;oldiers to the continental articles of war. Their principal objection has been, that it might &s;ubject them to long|er &s;ervice than that for which they engaged under their &s;eve|ral provincial e&s;tabli&s;hments. It is in vain to attemt to rea|&s;on away the prejudices of a whole army: * * * I have therefore forbore pre&s;&s;ing them, as I did not experience any &s;uch inconvenience from their adherence to their former rules, as would warrant the ri&s;k of entering into a conte&s;t upon it; more e&s;pecially as the re&s;traints, nece&s;&s;ary for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of e&s;&s;ential di&s;cipline and &s;ubordination, indi&s;po&s;ed their minds to every change, and made it both duty and policy to intro|duce as little novelty as po&s;&s;ible.&mdash;With the pre&s;ent army, I fear &s;uch a &s;ub&s;cription is impracticable: but the difficulty will cea&s;e with this army.</P>
<P>The Connecticut and Rhode-I&s;land troops &s;tand engaged to the fir&s;t of December only; and none longer than the fir&s;t of January. A di&s;&s;olution of the pre&s;ent army therefore will take place, unle&s;s &s;ome early provi&s;ion is made again&s;t &s;uch an event. Mo&s;t of the general officers are of opinion the greater part of them may be re-enli&s;ted for the winter, or another cam|paign, with the indulgence of a furlough to vi&s;it their friends, which may be regulated &s;o as not to endanger the &s;ervice. How far it may be proper to form the new army entirely out of the old, for another campaign, rather than from the contin|gents of the &s;everal provinces, is a que&s;tion which involves in it too many con&s;iderations of policy and prudence, for me to
<PB N="28" REF="031423_0027_0FEC47821FFD4520">
undertake to decide. It appears to be impo&s;&s;ible to draw it from any other &s;ource than the old army, for this winter: and, as the pay is ample, I hope a &s;ufficient number will engage in the &s;ervice for that time at lea&s;t. But there are various opini|ons of the temper of the men on the &s;ubject; and there may be great hazard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n deferring the trial &s;o long.</P>
<P>In the continental e&s;tabli&s;hment, no provi&s;ion has been made for the pay of artificers, di&s;tinct from that of the common &s;ol|diers; whereas, under the provincial, &s;uch as found their own tools, were allowed one &s;hilling per diem advance, and particu|lar artizans, more. The pay of the artillery al&s;o now differs from that of the province: the men have le&s;s, the officers more; and, for &s;ome ranks, no provi&s;ion is made, as the Con|gre&s;s will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve by the li&s;t which I have the honor to inclo&s;e (No. 1). The&s;e particulars, though &s;eemingly in|con&s;iderable, are the &s;ource of much complaint and di&s;&s;atisfac|tion, which I endeavor to compo&s;e in the be&s;t manner I am able.</P>
<P>By the return of the rifle companies, and that battalion, they appear to exceed their e&s;tabli&s;hment very con&s;iderably. I doubt my authority to pay the&s;e extra men without the directi|on of the Congre&s;s: but it would be deemed a great hard&s;hip, wholly to refu&s;e them, as they have been encouraged to come.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ities of the troops having required pay, I directed that tho&s;e of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts &s;hould receive for one month upon their being mu&s;tered, and returning a proper roll: but a claim was immediately made for pay by lunar months; and &s;e|veral regiments have declined taking up their warrants on this account. As this practice was entirely new to me, though &s;aid to be warranted by former u&s;age, here the matter now waits the determination of the honorable Congre&s;s. I find, in Connecti|cut and Rhode-I&s;land, this point was &s;ettled by calendar months; in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, though mentioned in Congre&s;s, it was left undetermined; which is al&s;o the ca&s;e of New-Hamp|&s;hire.</P>
<P>The inclo&s;ure No. 2, is a petition from the &s;ubalterns, re&s;pect|ing their pay. Where there are only two of the&s;e in a compa|ny, I have con&s;idered one as an en&s;ign, and ordered him pay as &s;uch, as in the Connecticut forces. I mu&s;t beg leave to recom|mend this petition to the favor of the Congre&s;s: as I am of o|pinion the allowance is inadequate to their rank and &s;ervice, and is one great &s;ource, of that familiarity between the officers and men, which is &s;o compatible with &s;ubordination and di&s;ci|pline. Many valuable officers of tho&s;e ranks, finding them&s;elves
<PB N="29" REF="031423_0028_0FEC489EB3599588">
unable to &s;upport the character and appearance of officers (I am informed) will retire as &s;oon as the term of &s;ervice is expired, if there is no alteration.</P>
<P>For the better regulation of duty, I found it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;et|tle the rank of the officers, and to number the regiments; and, as I had not received the command of the Congre&s;s on the &s;ubject, and the exigence of the &s;ervice forbade any further de|lay, the general officers were con&s;idered as having no regi|ments,&mdash;an alteration, which, I under&s;tand, is not plea&s;ing to &s;ome of them, but appeared to me and others to be proper, when it was con&s;idered, that, by this means, the whole army is put upon one footing, and all particular attachments di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>Among many other con&s;iderations which the approach of winter will demand, that of clothing appears to be one of the mo&s;t important. So far as regards the pre&s;ervation of the ar|my from cold, they may be deemed in a &s;tate of nakedne&s;s. Many of the men have been without blankets the whole cam|paign: and tho&s;e which have been in u&s;e during the &s;ummer, are &s;o much worn as to be of little &s;ervice. In order to make a &s;uitable provi&s;ion in the&s;e articles, and at the &s;ame time to guard the public again&s;t impo&s;ition and expen&s;e, it &s;eems nece&s;|&s;ary to determine the mode of continuing the army: for, &s;hould the&s;e troops be clothed under their pre&s;ent engagement, and at the expiration of the term of &s;ervice, decline renewing it, a &s;et of unprovided men may be &s;ent to &s;upply their places.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;uppo&s;e it to be unknown to the honorable Congre&s;s that, in all armies, it is an e&s;tabli&s;hed practice to make an al|lowance to officers, of provi&s;ions and forage, proportionnte to their rank. As &s;uch an allowance formed no part of the con|tinental e&s;tabli&s;hment, I have hitherto forbore to i&s;&s;ue the or|ders for that purpo&s;e: but, as it is a received opinion of &s;uch members of the Congre&s;s as I have had an opportunity of con|&s;ulting, as well as throughout the army, that it mu&s;t be deem|ed a matter of cour&s;e, and implied in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the army, I have directed the following proportion of rations, being the &s;ame allowed in the American armies la&s;t war:&mdash;major-general, fifteen; brigadier-general, twelve; colonel, &s;ix; lieu|tenant-colonel, five; major, four; captain, three; &s;ubaltern, two; &s;taff, two.</P>
<P>If the&s;e &s;hould not be approved by the honorable Congre&s;s, they will plea&s;e to &s;ignify their plea&s;ure, as to the alterations they would have made in the whole or in part.</P>
<P>I am now to inform the honorable Congre&s;s, that, encourag|ed by the repeated declarations of the Canadians and Indians,
<PB N="30" REF="031423_0029_0FEC47F91612C990">
and urged by their reque&s;ts, I have detached colonel Arnold with a thou&s;and men, to penetrate into Canada by way of Ken|nebeck river, and, if po&s;&s;ible to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Quebec. By this manoeuvre, I propo&s;ed either to divert Carleton from St. John's, which would leave a free pa&s;&s;age to general Schuy|ler;&mdash;or, if this did not take effect, Quebec, in its pre&s;ent de|fencele&s;s &s;tate, mu&s;t fall into his hands an ea&s;y prey. I made all po&s;&s;ible enquiry, as to the di&s;tance, the &s;afety of the route, and the danger of the &s;ea&s;on being too far advanced; but found no|thing in either, to deter me from proceeding, more e&s;pecially as it met with very general approbation from all whom I con&s;ulted upon it. But, that nothing might be omitted, to enable me to judge of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> propriety and probable con&s;equences, I communi|cated it by expre&s;s to general Schuyler, who approved of it in &s;uch terms, that I re&s;olved to put it in immediate execution. They have now left this place &s;even days; and, if favored with a good wind, I hope &s;oon to hear of their being &s;afe at Kenne-beck river. For the &s;atisfaction of the Congre&s;s, I here inclo&s;e a copy of the propo&s;ed route (No. 3). I al&s;o do my&s;elf the ho|nor of inclo&s;ing a manife&s;to, which I cau&s;ed to be printed here, and of which colonel Arnold has taken a &s;uitable number with him. This is the inclo&s;ure, No. 4. I have al&s;o forwarded a copy of his in&s;tructions (No. 5):&mdash;from all which, I hope the Congre&s;s will have a clear view of the motives, plan, and in|tended execution of this enterpri&s;e, and that I &s;hall be &s;o hap|py as to meet with their approbation in it.</P>
<P>I was th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> more induced to make this detachment, as it is my clear opinion, from a careful ob&s;ervation of the movements of the enemy, corroborated by all the intelligence we receive by de&s;erters and others, (of the former of whom we have &s;ome e|very day) that the enemy have no intention to come out, until they are reinforced. They have been wholly employed for &s;ome time pa&s;t in procuring materials for barracks, fuel, and making other preparations for winter. The&s;e circum&s;tances, with the con&s;tant additions to their works which are apparently defen&s;ive, have led to the above conclu&s;ion, and enabled me to &s;pare this body of men where I hope they will be u&s;efully and &s;ucce&s;sfully employed.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of inactivity, in which this army has lain for &s;ome time, by no means corre&s;ponds with my wi&s;hes, by &s;ome deci&s;ive &s;troke to relieve my country from the heavy expen&s;e its &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence mu&s;t create. After frequently reconnoitring the &s;itua|tion of the enemy the town of Bo&s;ton, collecting all po&s;&s;ible intelligence, and dige&s;ting the whole, a &s;urpri&s;e did not appear
<PB N="31" REF="031423_0030_0FEC4A149BE73040">
to me wholly impracticable, though hazardous. I communicat|ed it to the general officers &s;ome days before I called them to a council, that they might be prepared with their opinions. The re&s;ult I have the honor of inclo&s;ing (No. 6). I cannot &s;ay that I have wholly laid it a&s;ide: but new events may occa&s;ion new mea&s;ures. Of this I hope the honorable Congre&s;s can need no a&s;&s;urance, that there is not a man in America who more earne&s;t|ly wi&s;hes &s;uch a termination of the campaign, as to make the army no longer nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;on advances &s;o fa&s;t, that I have given orders to pre|pare barracks and other accommodations for the winter. The great &s;carcity of tow-cloth in this country, I fear, will totally di&s;appoint us in our expectations of procuring hunting-&s;hirts.&mdash;Governor Cooke informs me, few or none are to be had in Rhode-I&s;land; and governor Trumbull gives me little encou|ragement to expect many from Connecticut.</P>
<P>I have filled up the office of quarter-ma&s;ter-general, which the Congre&s;s was plea&s;ed to leave to me, by the appointment of major Mifflin, which I hope and believe will be univer&s;ally ac|ceptable.</P>
<P>It gives me great pain to be obliged to &s;olicit the attention of the honorable Congre&s;s to the &s;tate of this army, in terms which imply the &s;lighte&s;t apprehen&s;ion of being neglected. But my &s;ituation is inexpre&s;&s;ibly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, to &s;ee the winter fa&s;t approaching upon a naked army; the time of their &s;ervice with|in a few weeks of expiring; and no provi&s;ion yet made for &s;uch important events. Added to the&s;e, the military che&s;t is totally exhau&s;ted: the payma&s;ter has not a &s;ingle dollar in hand: the commi&s;&s;ary-general a&s;&s;ures me he has &s;trained his credit, for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the army, to the utmo&s;t. The quarter-ma&s;ter-ge|neral is preci&s;ely in the &s;ame &s;ituation; and the greater part of the troops not far from mutiny, upon the deduction of their &s;ta|ted allowance. I know not to whom I am to impute this fail|ure: but I am opinion, if the evil is not immediately remedi|ed, and more punctually ob&s;erved in future, the army mu&s;t ab|&s;olutely break up. I hope I have &s;o fully expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf on this &s;ubject (both by letter, and to tho&s;e members of the Con|gre&s;s who honored the camp with a vi&s;it), that no di&s;appoint|ment could po&s;&s;ibly happen: I therefore hourly expected ad|vice from the payma&s;ter that he had received a fre&s;h &s;upply, in addition to the hundred and &s;eventy-two thou&s;and dollars deli|vered him in Augu&s;t: and thought my&s;elf warranted to a&s;&s;ure the public creditors that in a few days they &s;hould be &s;atisfied. But the delay has brought matters to &s;uch a cri&s;is, as admits of
<PB N="32" REF="031423_0031_0FEC47F724EE6FF0">
no further uncertain expectation. I have therefore &s;ent off this expre&s;s, with orders to make all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch. It is my mo&s;t earne&s;t reque&s;t that he may be returned with all po&s;&s;ible expedition, unle&s;s the honorable Congre&s;s have already forwar|ded what is &s;o indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary.</P>

<P>THE reverend Mr. Kirkland, the bearer of this, having been introduced to the honorable Congre&s;s, can need no parti|cular recommendation from me. But as he now wi&s;hes to have the affair of his mi&s;&s;ion and public employ put upon &s;ome &s;uita|ble footing, I cannot but intimate my &s;en&s;e of the importance of his &s;tation, and the great advantages which have and may re|&s;ult to the United Colonies, from his &s;ituation being made re|&s;pectable.</P>
<P>All accounts agree that much of the favorable di&s;po&s;ition &s;hewn by the Indians, may be a&s;cribed to his labor and influence. He has accompanied a chief of the Oneidas to this camp, which I have endeavored to make agreeable to him, both by civility and &s;ome &s;mall pre&s;ents.

<P>I cannot but congratulate the honorable Congre&s;s on the hap|py temper of the Canadians and Indians, our accounts of which are now fully confirmed by &s;ome intercepted letters from offi|cers in Canada to general Gage and others in Bo&s;ton, which were found on board the ve&s;&s;el lately taken, going into Bo&s;ton with a donation of cattle and other fre&s;h provi&s;ions for the mini&s;teri|al army.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS honored with your favor of the twenty-&s;ixth ul|timo, late the night before la&s;t; and a meeting of the general officers having been called upon a bu&s;ine&s;s which will make a con&s;iderable part of this letter, I took the opportunity of lay|ing before them tho&s;e parts of yours which re&s;pect the continu|ance and new-modelling of the army, the fuel, clothing, and other preparations for the en&s;uing winter. They have taken
<PB N="33" REF="031423_0032_0FEC4A5AF1FF5CB8">
two or three days to con&s;ider; and, as &s;oon as I am po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of their opinions, I &s;hall lo&s;e no time in tran&s;mitting the re&s;ult, not only on the above &s;ubjects, but the number of troops nece&s;&s;ary to be kept up.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o directed the commi&s;&s;ary-general and the quarter ma&s;ter-general to prepare e&s;timates of the expence of their de|partments for a certain given number of men, from which a judg|ment may be made, when the number of men, to be kept in pay is determined:&mdash;all which I &s;hall do my&s;elf the honor to lay before the Congre&s;s, as &s;oon as they are ready.</P>
<P>I have now a painful, though a nece&s;&s;ary duty to perform, re|&s;pecting Dr. Church, director-general of the ho&s;pital. About a week ago, Mr. &s;ecretary Ward of Providence, &s;ent up to me one Wainwood, an inhabitant of Newport, with a letter direct|ed to Major Cane in Bo&s;ton, in [<HI>accult</HI>] characters, which he &s;aid had been left with Wainwood &s;ome time ago, by a woman who was kept by Dr. Church. She had before pre&s;&s;ed Wain|wood to take her to captain Wallace, Mr. Dudley the collec|tor, or George Rome; which he declined. She then gave him the letter, with a &s;trict charge to deliver it to either of tho&s;e gentlemen. He &s;u&s;pecting &s;ome improper corre&s;pondence, kept the letter, and after &s;ome time opened it; but, not being able to read it, laid it up, where it remained until he received an ob&s;cure letter from the woman, expre&s;&s;ing an anxiety after the original letter. He then communicated the whole matter to Mr. Ward, who &s;ent him up with the papers to me. I imme|diately &s;ecured the woman; but for a long time &s;he was proof again&s;t every threat and per&s;ua&s;ion to di&s;cover the author.&mdash;However, at length &s;he was brought to a confe&s;&s;ion, and named Dr. Church. I then immediately &s;ecured him and all his pa|pers. Upon his fir&s;t examination, he readily acknowledged the letter, &s;aid it was de&s;igned for his brother Fleming, and, when deciphered, would be found to contain nothing criminal. He acknowledged his never having communicated the corre&s;pond|ence to any per&s;on here but the girl, and made many prote&s;ta|tions of the purity of his intentions. Having found a per&s;on ca|pable of deciphering the letter, I, in the mean time, had all his papers &s;earched, but found nothing criminal among them: but it appeared on enquiry, that a confident had been among the papers before my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">enger arrived. I then called the gene|ral officers together for their advice, the re&s;ult of which you will find in the inclo&s;ure, No. 1. The deciphered letter is the inclo&s;ure No. 2. The army and country are exceedingly irri|tated; and upon a free di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the nature, circum&s;tances,
<PB N="34" REF="031423_0033_0FEC4A6771B357C8">
and con&s;equence of this matter, it has been unanimou&s;ly agreed to lay it before the honorable Congre&s;s for their &s;pecial advice and direction; at the &s;ame time &s;ugge&s;ting to their con&s;ideration, whether an alteration of the twenty-eighth article of war may not be nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>As I &s;hall re&s;erve all further remarks upon the &s;tate of the army till my next, I &s;hall now beg leave to reque&s;t the deter|mination of Congre&s;s, as to the property and di&s;po&s;al of &s;uch ve&s;&s;els and cargoes as are de&s;igned for the &s;upply of the enemy, and may fall into our hands. There has been an event of this kind at Port&s;mouth (as by the inclo&s;ure, No. 3), in which I have directed the cargo to be brought hither for the u&s;e of the army, re&s;erving the &s;ettlement of any claims of capture to the deci&s;ion of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>As there are many unfortunate individuals who&s;e property has been confi&s;cated by the enemy, I would humbly &s;ugge&s;t to the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s the humanity of applying, in part or in the whole, &s;uch captures to the relief of tho&s;e &s;ufferers, after compen&s;ating any expence of the captors, and for their ac|tivity and &s;pirit. I am the more induced to reque&s;t this deter|mination may be &s;peedy, as I have directed three ve&s;&s;els to be equipped in order to cut off the &s;upplies; and, from the num|ber of ve&s;&s;els hourly arriving, it may become an object of &s;ome importance. In the di&s;po&s;al of the&s;e captures, for the encou|ragement of the officers and men, I have allowed them one-third of the cargoes, except military &s;tores, which, with the ve&s;&s;els, are to be re&s;erved for the public u&s;e. I hope my plan, as well as the execution, will be favored with the approbation of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>One Mr. Fi&s;k, an intelligent per&s;on, came out of Bo&s;ton on the third in&s;tant, and gives us the following advices:&mdash;that a fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of a &s;ixty-four, and twenty-gun &s;hip, two &s;loops of eighteen guns, and two tran&s;ports with &s;ix hundred men, were to &s;ail from Bo&s;ton as ye&s;terday; that they took on board two mortars, four howitzers, and other artillery, calculated for the bombardment of a town:&mdash;their de&s;tination was kept a profound &s;ecret:&mdash;that an expre&s;s &s;loop of war, which left En|gland the eighth Augu&s;t, arrived four days ago;&mdash;that gene|ral Gage is recalled, and la&s;t &s;unday, re&s;igned his command to General Howe;&mdash;that Lord Percy, colonel Smith, and other offi|cers who were at Lexington, are ordered home with Gage;&mdash;that &s;ix &s;hips of the line and two cutters were coming out un|der &s;ir Peter Dennis;&mdash;that five regiments and a thou&s;and ma|rines are ordered out, and may be expected in three or four

weeks:&mdash;no pro&s;pect of accommodation; but the mini&s;try deter|mined to pu&s;h the war to the utmo&s;t.</P>
<P>I have an expre&s;s from colonel Arnold, and herewith &s;end a copy of his letter and an inclo&s;ure, No. 4 and 5.&mdash;I am happy in finding he meets with no di&s;couragement.&mdash;The claim of the rifle officers, to be independent of all the &s;uperior officers, ex|cept colonel Arnold, is without any countenance or authority from me, as I have &s;ignified in my la&s;t di&s;patch both to colonel Arnold and captain Morgan.&mdash;The captain of the brig from Quebec for Bo&s;ton, informs me, that there is no &s;u&s;picion of any &s;uch expedition; and that, if Carleton is not driven from St. John's, &s;o as to be obliged to throw him&s;elf into Quebec, it mu&s;t fall into our hands, as it is left without a regular &s;oldier, and many of the inhabitants are mo&s;t favourably di&s;po&s;ed to the American cau&s;e;&mdash;and that there is the large&s;t &s;tock of ammunition ever collected in America.</P>
<P>In the above ve&s;&s;el &s;ome letters were al&s;o found, from an officer at Quebec, to General Gage and major Sheriff at Bo&s;|ton, containing &s;uch an account of the temper of the Canadi|ans, as cannot but afford the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM honored with your &s;everal favors of the twenty-&s;ixth and thirtieth September, and fifth October, the contents of which I &s;hall beg leave to notice in their re&s;pective order.</P>
<P>Previous to the direction of Congre&s;s to con&s;ult the general officers on the be&s;t mode of continuing and providing for the army during the winter, I had de&s;ired them to turn their thoughts upon the&s;e &s;ubjects, and to favor me with the re&s;ult, by a particular day, in writing. In this interval, the appointment of Dr. Frank|lin, Mr. Lynch, and colonel Harri&s;on, was communicated,&mdash;an event, which has given me the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction, as the &s;ubject was too weighty and complex for a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion by letter. This appointment made any conclu&s;ion here unnece&s;&s;ary, as it is not probable any &s;uch arrangement would be agreed on, as would not be altered in &s;ome re&s;pects, upon a full and free conference. This good effect will ari&s;e from the &s;tep already taken, that every officer will be prepared to give his &s;entiments upon the&s;e important &s;ubjects.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="031423_0035_0FEC4A6E88600EE8">
The e&s;timates of the commi&s;&s;ary and quarter-ma&s;ter-general I have now the honor of inclo&s;ing. The fir&s;t is No. 1,&mdash;the other No. 2.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the reduction of the pay of the men, which may enter into the con&s;ideration of their &s;upport, it is the unani|mous opinion of the general officers, that it cannot be touched with &s;afety at pre&s;ent. * * *</P>
<P>Upon the pre&s;umption of there being a vacancy in the direction of the ho&s;pital, lieutenant-colonel Hand, formerly a &s;urgeon in the eighteenth regiment of royal Iri&s;h, and Dr. Fo&s;ter, late of Charle&s;town, and one of the &s;urgeons of the ho&s;pital under Dr. Church, are candidates for that office. I do not pretend to be acquainted with their re&s;pective merits, and therefore have given them no farther expectation, than that they &s;hould be mentioned as candidates for the department. I therefore need only to add upon this &s;ubject, that the affairs of the ho&s;pital require that the appointment &s;hould be made as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Before I was honored with your favor of the fifth in&s;tant, I had given orders for the equipment of &s;ome armed ve&s;&s;els, to in|tercept the enemy's &s;upplies of provi&s;ions and ammunition. One of them was on a crui&s;e between Cape Anne and Cape Cod, when the expre&s;s arrived. The others will be fit for the &s;ea in a few days, under the command of officers of the continental army, who are well recommended, as per&s;ons acquainted with the &s;ea, and capable of &s;uch a &s;ervice. Two of the&s;e will be immedi|ately di&s;patched on this duty; and every particular, mentioned in your favor of the fifth in&s;tant, literally complied with.</P>
<P>That the honorable Congre&s;s may have a more complete idea of the plan on which the&s;e ve&s;&s;els are equipped, I inclo&s;e a copy of the in&s;tructions given to the captains now out, (No. 4). The&s;e, with the additional in&s;tructions directed, will be given to the captains who go into the mouth of St. Lawrence's river. As both officers and men mo&s;t cheerfully engage in the &s;ervice on the terms mentioned in the&s;e in&s;tructions, I fear that the propo&s;ed increa&s;e will create &s;ome difficulty, by making a dif|ference between men engaged on &s;imilar &s;ervice. I have there|fore not yet communicated this part of the plan, but re&s;erved an extra bounty as a reward for extraordinary activity. There are no armed ve&s;&s;els in this province; and governor Cooke informs me the enterpri&s;e can receive no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from him, as one of the armed ve&s;&s;els of Rhode-I&s;land is on a long crui&s;e, and the other unfit for &s;ervice. Nothing &s;hall be omitted to &s;ecure &s;ucce&s;s. A fortunate capture of an ordnance &s;hip would give new life to the camp, and an immediate turn to the i&s;&s;ue of the campaign.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="031423_0036_0FEC4A72E1D8CF68">
Our la&s;t accounts from colonel Arnold are very favorable: he was proceeding with all expedition; and I flatter my&s;elf (making all allowances) he will be at Quebec the twentieth in|&s;tant, where a gentleman from Canada (Mr. * * *) a&s;&s;ures me he will meet with no re&s;i&s;tance.</P>

<P>From the various accounts received from Europe, there may be rea&s;on to expect troops will be landed at New-York, or &s;ome other middle colony.

<P>The fleet, mentioned in my la&s;t, has been &s;een &s;tanding N. N. E. &s;o that we apprehend it is intended for &s;ome part of this province, or New-Hamp&s;hire, or po&s;&s;ibly Quebec.</P>
<P>The late&s;t and be&s;t accounts we have from the enemy, are, that they are engaged in their new work acro&s;s the &s;outh end of Bo&s;ton, preparing their barracks, &amp;c. for winter:&mdash;that it is pro|po&s;ed to keep from five hundred to a thou&s;and men on Bunker's hill all winter, who are to be relieved once a week;&mdash;the re&s;t to be drawn into Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>A per&s;on who has lately been a &s;ervant to major Conolly, (a tool of Lord Dunmore's) has given an account of a &s;cheme to di&s;tre&s;s the &s;outhern provinces, which appeared to me of &s;ufficient con&s;equence to be immediately tran&s;mitted. I have therefore got it atte&s;ted, and do my&s;elf the honor of inclo&s;ing it, No. 5.</P>
<P>The new levies from Connecticut have lately marched into camp, and are a body of as good troops as any we have: &s;o that we have now the &s;ame &s;trength, as before the detachment made under colonel Arnold.</P>
<P>I am, with the mo&s;t re&s;pectful &s;entiments to the honorable Con|gre&s;s, and your&s;elf, &s;ir, your mo&s;t obedient, &amp;c.</P>

<P>MY conjecture of the de&s;tination of the late &s;quadron from Bo&s;ton, in my la&s;t, has been unhappily verified by an out|rage, exceeding, in barbarity and cruelty, every ho&s;tile act practi&s;ed among civili&s;ed nations. I have enclo&s;ed the account given me by Mr. Jones, a gentleman of the town of Falmouth, of the de&s;truction of that increa&s;ing and flouri&s;hing village. He is a very great &s;ufferer, and informs me that the time allowed for the removal of effects was &s;o &s;mall, that valuable property of all kinds, and to a great amount, has been de&s;troyed. The or|ders &s;hewn by the captain for this horrid procedure, (by which it appears the &s;ame de&s;olation is meditated upon all the towns on the coa&s;t) made it my duty to communicate it as quickly and exten&s;ively as po&s;&s;ible. As Port&s;mouth was the next place to which he propo&s;ed to go, general Sullivan was permitted to go up, and give them his a&s;&s;i&s;tance and advice to ward off the blow. I flatter my&s;elf the like event will not happen there, as they have a fortification of &s;ome &s;trength, and a ve&s;&s;el has ar|rived at a place called Sheep&s;cot, with fifteen hundred pounds of powder.</P>
<P>The gentlemen of the Congre&s;s have nearly fini&s;hed their bu&s;ine&s;s: but as they write by this opportunity, I mu&s;t beg leave to refer you to their letter, for what concerns their com|mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>We have had no occurrence of any con&s;equence in the camp &s;ince I had the honor of addre&s;&s;ing you la&s;t; but expect every hour to hear that Newport has &s;hared the fate of unhappy Fal|mouth.</P>

<P>The information, which the gentlemen who have lately gone from hence can give the Congre&s;s, of the &s;tate and &s;ituation of the army, would have made a letter unnece&s;&s;ary, if I did not &s;uppo&s;e there would be &s;ome anxiety to know the intentions of the army on the &s;ubject of the re-enli&s;tment.</P>
<P>Agreeable to the advice of tho&s;e gentlemen, and my own opinion, I immediately began by directing all &s;uch officers as propo&s;ed to continue, to &s;ignify their intentions as &s;oon as po&s;|&s;ible. A great number of the returns are come in, from which I find that a very great proportion of the officers of the rank

of captains, and under, will retire;&mdash;from pre&s;ent appearances, I may &s;ay, half,&mdash;but at lea&s;t, one third. It is with &s;ome con|cern al&s;o that I ob&s;erve, that many of the officers who retire, di&s;courage the continuance of the men, and, I fear, will com|municate the infection to them. Some have advi&s;ed that tho&s;e officers who decline the &s;ervice &s;hould be immediately di&s;mi&s;&s;|ed; but this would be very dangerous and inconvenient. I confe&s;s I have great anxieties upon the &s;ubject, though I &s;till hope the pay and terms are &s;o advantageous, that intere&s;t, and, I hope al&s;o, a regard to their country, will retain a greater proportion of privates than their officers. In &s;o important a mat|ter, I &s;hall e&s;teem it my indi&s;pen&s;able duty, not only to act with all po&s;&s;ible prudence, but to give the mo&s;t early and con&s;tant ad|vice of my progre&s;s.</P>
<P>A &s;upply of cloathing, equal to our nece&s;&s;ities, would greatly contribute to the encouragement and &s;atisfaction of the men. In every point of view, it is &s;o important that I beg leave to call the attention of the Congre&s;s to it in a particular manner.</P>

<P>The inclo&s;ed return &s;hews, at one view, what reliance we have upon the officers of this army, and how deficient we are like to be in &s;ubaltern officers.

<P>I mu&s;t beg leave to recall the attention of the Congre&s;s to the appointment of a brigadier-general,&mdash;an officer as nece&s;&s;ary to a brigade, as a colonel is to a regiment, and will be exceedingly wanted in the new arrangement.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The immediate occa&s;ion of my giving the Congre&s;s the trouble of a letter at this time is to inform them, that, in con|&s;equence of their order, &s;ignified in your letter of the twentieth ultimo, I laid my&s;elf under a &s;olemn tie of &s;ecrecy to captain M'Pher&s;on, and proceeded to examine his plan for the de&s;truc|tion of the fleet in the harbor of Bo&s;ton, with all that care and attention which the importance of it de&s;erved, and my judgment could lead to. But not being happy enough to coincide in opi|nion with that gentleman, and finding that his &s;cheme would in|volve greater expence, than (under my doubts of its &s;ucce&s;s) I thought my&s;elf ju&s;tified in giving into, I prevailed upon him to communicate his plan to three gentlemen of the artillery in this army, well acquainted in the knowledge and practice of gunnery. By them he has been convinced, that, ina&s;much as he &s;et out upon wrong principles, the &s;cheme would prove abortive. Un|willing, however, to relinqui&s;h his favourite project of reducing the naval force of Great-Britain, he is very de&s;irous of build|ing a number of row gallies for this purpo&s;e. But as the Con|gre&s;s alone are competent to the adoption of this mea&s;ure, I have advi&s;ed him-(although he offered to go on with the building of them at his own expence, till the Congre&s;s &s;hould decide) to repair immediately to Philadelphia with his propo&s;als; where, if they &s;hould be agreed to, or ve&s;&s;els of &s;uperior force, agreeable to the wi&s;hes of mo&s;t others, &s;hould be re&s;olved on, he may &s;et in&s;tantly about them, with all the materials upon the &s;pot:&mdash;here, they are to collect.&mdash;To him therefore I refer for further informa|tion on this head.</P>
<P>A ve&s;&s;el, &s;aid to be from Philadelphia and bound to Bo&s;ton, with a hundred and twenty pipes of wine (a hundred and eigh|teen of which are &s;ecured) &s;tranded at a place called Ea&s;tham, in a gale of wind, on the &s;econd in&s;tant;&mdash;another, from Bo&s;ton, to Halifax, with dry goods &amp;c. (amounting, per invoice, to about two hundred and forty pounds lawful money) got di&s;abled in the &s;ame gale, near Beverly. The&s;e cargoes, with the papers, I have
<PB N="41" REF="031423_0040_0FEC4A7F11EF4348">
ordered to this place,&mdash;the ve&s;&s;els to be taken care of till fur|ther orders. I have al&s;o an account of the taking of a wood|&s;loop bound to Bo&s;ton, and carried into Port&s;mouth by one of our armed ve&s;&s;els;&mdash;particulars not yet come to hand;&mdash;and this in&s;tant, of two others, from Nova-Scotia to Bo&s;ton, with hay, wood, live &s;tock, &amp;c. by another of our armed &s;chooners.&mdash;The&s;e are in Plymouth.</P>
<P>The&s;e accidents and captures point out the nece&s;&s;ity of e&s;tabli&s;h|ing proper courts without lo&s;s of time, for the deci&s;ion of property, and the legality of &s;eizures; otherwi&s;e I may be involved in in|extricable difficulties.</P>
<P>Our pri&s;oners, by the reduction of Fort Chamblee (on which happy event I mo&s;t &s;incerely congratulate the Congre&s;s), being con&s;iderably augmented, and likely to be increa&s;ed, I &s;ubmit it to the wi&s;dom of Congre&s;s, whether &s;ome convenient inland towns, remote from the po&s;t-roads, ought not to be a&s;&s;igned them; the manner of their treatment, &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, &amp;c. defin|ed; and a commi&s;&s;ary or agent appointed, to &s;ee that ju&s;tice is done both to them and the public, proper accounts rendered, &amp;c. Without a mode of this &s;ort is adopted, I fear there will be &s;ad confu&s;ion hereafter, as there are great complaints at pre|&s;ent.</P>
<P>I reckoned without my ho&s;t, when I informed the Congre&s;s in my la&s;t, that I &s;hould in a day or two be able to acquaint them of the di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;oldiery towards a new enli&s;tment-I have been in con&s;ultation with the generals of this army ever &s;ince Thur&s;day la&s;t, endeavoring to e&s;tabli&s;h new corps of offi|cers; but find &s;o many doubts and difficulties to reconcile, that I cannot &s;ay when they are to end, or what may be the con&s;e|quences; as there appears to be &s;uch an unwillingne&s;s in the officers of one government mixing in the &s;ame regiment with tho&s;e of another; and, without it, many mu&s;t be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, who are willing to &s;erve; notwith&s;tanding, we are deficient on the whole.</P>
<P>The council of Officers are unanimou&s;ly of opinion that the command of the artillery &s;hould no longer continue in colonel * * *; and knowing of no per&s;on better qualified to &s;upply his place, or who&s;e appointment will give more general &s;atis|faction, have taken the liberty of recommending Henry Knox, e&s;quire, to the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s, thinking it indi&s;pen&s;a|bly nece&s;&s;ary, at the &s;ame time, that this regiment &s;hould con|&s;i&s;t of two lieutenant-colonels, two majors, and twelve compa|nies, agreeable to the plan and e&s;timate handed in; which dif|fering

from the la&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment, I &s;hould be glad to be in&s;truct|ed on.</P>
<P>The commi&s;&s;ary-general not being returned, will apologi&s;e, I hope, for my &s;ilence re&s;pecting a requi&s;ition of the expence of his clerks, &amp;c. which I was to have obtained together with others, and forwarded.</P>
<P>I have heard nothing of colonel Arnold &s;ince the thirteenth ultimo. His letter of, and journal to that date, will convey all the information I am able to give of him. I think he mu&s;t be in Quebec. If any mi&s;chance had happened to him, he would, as directed, have forwarded an expre&s;s.&mdash;No account yet of the arm|ed ve&s;&s;els &s;ent to St. Laurence.&mdash;I think they will meet the &s;tores inward or outward bound.</P>
<P>Captain Symons, in the Cerberus, lately &s;ent from Bo&s;ton to Falmouth, hath publi&s;hed the inclo&s;ed declaration at that place; and it is &s;u&s;pected he intends to make &s;ome kind of a lodgment there. I wrote immediately to colonel Finnie, of this army, who went up there upon the la&s;t alarm, to &s;pirit up the people and oppo&s;e it at all events.&mdash;Falmouth is about a hundred and thirty miles from this camp.</P>

<P>* * * Inclo&s;ed, you have a copy of an act, pa&s;&s;ed this &s;e&s;|&s;ion, by the honorable council and hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives of this province. It re&s;pects &s;uch captures as may be made by ve&s;&s;els fitted out by the province, or by individuals thereof.&mdash;As the armed ve&s;&s;els, fitted out at the continental expence, do not come under this law, I would have it &s;ubmitted to the con&s;i|deration of Congre&s;s, to point out a more &s;ummary way of pro|ceeding, to determine the property and mode of condemnation of &s;uch prizes as have been or hereafter may be made, than is &s;peci|fied in this act.</P>
<P>Should not a court be e&s;tabli&s;hed by authority of Congre&s;s, to take cogni&s;ance of prizes made by the continental ve&s;&s;els?&mdash;Whatever the mode is which they are plea&s;ed to adopt, there is an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of its being &s;peedily determined on: for I cannot &s;pare time from military affairs, to give proper attention to the&s;e matters.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Plymouth have taken a &s;loop, laden with
<PB N="43" REF="031423_0042_0FEC4A8467A85FD0">
provi&s;ions, &amp;c. from Halifax, bound to Bo&s;ton, and the inha|bitants of Beverly have, under cover of one of the armed &s;choon|ers, taken a ve&s;&s;el from Ireland, laden with beef, pork, butter, &amp;c. for the &s;ame place. The latter brings papers and letters of a very intere&s;ting nature, which are in the hands of the ho|norable council, who informed me they will tran&s;mit them to you by this conveyance. To the contents of the&s;e papers and letters, I mu&s;t beg leave to refer you and the honorable Con|gre&s;s, who will now &s;ee the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity there is, of exert|ing all their wi&s;dom, to with&s;tand the mighty efforts of our enemies.</P>
<P>The trouble I have in the arrangement of the army is really inconceivable. Many of the officers &s;ent in their names to &s;erve, in expectation of promotion; others &s;tood aloof * * *; whil&s;t a number who have declined, have again &s;ent in their names, to &s;erve. So great has the confu&s;ion, ari&s;ing from the&s;e and many other perplexing circum&s;tances, been, that I found it ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to fix this very intere&s;ting bu&s;ine&s;s exactly on the plan re&s;olved on in the conference, though I have kept up to the &s;pirit, as near as the nature and nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e would admit of; the difficulty with the &s;oldiers is as great,&mdash;indeed more &s;o, if po&s;&s;ible, than with the officers. They will not enli&s;t, until they know their colonel, lieutenant-colonel, major, captain, &amp;c. &s;o that it was nece&s;&s;ary to fix the officers the fir&s;t thing; which is, at la&s;t, in &s;ome manner done; and I have given out enli&s;ting orders.</P>
<P>You, &s;ir, can much ea&s;ier judge, than I can expre&s;s, the anx|iety of mind I mu&s;t labor under on the occa&s;ion, e&s;pecially at this time, when we may expect the enemy will begin to act on the arrival of their reinforcement, part of which is already come, and the remainder daily dropping in.</P>
<P>I have other di&s;tre&s;&s;es of a very alarming nature. The arms of our &s;oldiery are &s;o exceeding bad, that I a&s;&s;ure you, &s;ir, I cannot place a proper confidence in them. Our powder is wa&s;t|ing fa&s;t, notwith&s;tanding the &s;tricte&s;t care, economy, and at|tention is paid to it. The long &s;eries of wet weather we have had, renders the greater part of what has been &s;erved out to the men, of no u&s;e. Ye&s;terday I had a proof of it, as a party of the enemy, about four or five hundred, taking the advan|tage of a high tide, landed at Leechmore's point: we were a|larmed, and of cour&s;e ordered every man to examine his car|touch-box; when the melancholy truth appeared; and we were obliged to furni&s;h the greater part of them with fre&s;h ammuni|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="031423_0043_0FEC4A8C00755EE0">
The damage done at the point was the taking of a man who watched a few hor&s;es and cows; ten of the latter they carried off. Colonel Thomp&s;on marched down with his regiment of riflemen, and was joined by colonel Woodbridge, with a part of his and a part of Patter&s;on's regiment, who gallantly waded through the water, and &s;oon obliged the enemy to embark un|der cover of a man-of-war, a floating battery, and the fire of a battery on Charle&s;town neck. We have two of our men dan|gerou&s;ly wounded by grape &s;hot from the man-of-war, and, by a flag &s;ent out this day, we are informed the enemy lo&s;t two of their men.</P>

<P>I received your favors of the &s;eventh and tenth in&s;tant, with the re&s;olves of the honorable Congre&s;s, to which I will pay all due attention.&mdash;As &s;oon as two capable per&s;ons can be found, I will di&s;patch them to Nova-Scotia, on the &s;ervice re&s;olved on in Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>The re&s;olve to rai&s;e two battalions of marines will (if practi|cable in this army) entirely derange what has been done. It is therein mentioned, "one colonel for the two battalions."&mdash;of cour&s;e, a colonel mu&s;t be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. One of the many diffi|culties, which attended the new arrangement, was in reconcil|ing the different intere&s;ts, and judging of the merits of the dif|ferent colonels.&mdash;In the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of this one, the &s;ame difficul|ties will occur.&mdash;The officers and men mu&s;t be acquainted with maritime affairs; to comply with which, they mu&s;t be picked out of the whole army,&mdash;one from this corps, one from another,&mdash;&s;o as to break through the whole &s;y&s;tem, which has co&s;t us &s;o much time, anxiety and pains, to bring into any to|lerable form. Notwith&s;tanding any difficulties which will ari&s;e, you may be a&s;&s;ured, &s;ir, that I will u&s;e every endeavor to comply with their re&s;olve.</P>
<P>I beg leave to &s;ubmit it to the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s (if the&s;e two battalions can be formed out of this army) whether this is a time to weaken our lines, by employing any of the for|ces appointed to defend them, on any other &s;ervice. The gen|tlemen who were here from the Congre&s;s know their va&s;t ex|tent: they mu&s;t know that we &s;hall have occa&s;ion for our whole force for that purpo&s;e; more &s;o now than at any pa&s;t time, as we may expect the enemy will take the advantage of the fir&s;t
<PB N="45" REF="031423_0044_0FEC4A8F40273EE0">
hard weather, and attempt to make an impre&s;&s;ion &s;omewhere. That this is their intention, we have many rea&s;ons to &s;u&s;pect.</P>
<P>We have had, in the la&s;t week, &s;ix de&s;erters, and took two &s;traggling pri&s;oners. They all agree that two companies, with a train of artillery and one of the regiments from Ireland, were ar|rived at Bo&s;ton;&mdash;that fre&s;h ammunition and flints have been &s;erv|ed out;&mdash;that the grenadiers and light infantry had orders to hold them&s;elves in readine&s;s at a moment's warning.</P>
<P>As there is every appearance that this conte&s;t will not be &s;oon decided, and of cour&s;e that there mu&s;t be an augmentation of the continental army, would it not be eligible to rai&s;e two battalions of marines in New-York and Philadelphia, where there mu&s;t be numbers of &s;ailors now unemployed?&mdash;This however is matter of opinion, which I mention with all due deference to the &s;uperior judgment of the Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed, you have copies of two letters,&mdash;one from colonel Arnold,&mdash;the other from colonel * * *. I can form no judg|ment on the latter's conduct, until I &s;ee him. Notwith&s;tanding the great defection, I do not di&s;pair of colonel Arnold's &s;ucce&s;s. He will have, in all probability, many more difficulties to en|counter, than if he had been a fortnight &s;ooner; as it is likely that governor Carleton will, with what forces he can collect after the &s;urrender of the re&s;t of Canada, throw him&s;elf into Quebec, and there make his la&s;t effort. There is no late account from captains Broughton and Sillman, &s;ent to the river St. Laurence. The other crui&s;ers have been chiefly confined to harbor, by the badne&s;s of the weather. The &s;ame rea&s;on has cau&s;ed great delay in building of our barracks; which, with a mo&s;t morti|fying &s;carcity of fire-wood, di&s;courages the men from enli&s;t|ing. The la&s;t, I am afraid, is an in&s;uperable ob&s;tacle. I have applied to the honorable hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives of this province, who were plea&s;ed to appoint a committee to negotiate this bu|&s;ine&s;s; and notwith&s;tanding all the pains they have and are ta|king, they find it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;upply our nece&s;&s;ities. The want of a &s;ufficient number of teams, I under&s;tand to be the chief im|pediment.</P>
<P>I got returns this day from eleven colonels, of the numbers enli&s;ted in their regiments. The whole amount is nine hundred and &s;ixty-&s;ix men. There mu&s;t be &s;ome other &s;timulus be&s;ides love for their country, to make men fond of the &s;ervice. It would be a great encouragement, and no additional expence to the continent, were they to receive pay for the months of Oc|tober and November; al&s;o a month's pay advance. The pre|&s;ent

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD the honor of writing to you on the nineteenth in&s;tant. I have now to inform you that Henry Knox, e&s;quire, is gone to New-York, with orders to forward to this place what cannon and ordnance &s;tores can be there procured. From thence he will proceed to general Schuyler on the &s;ame bu&s;ine&s;s, as you will &s;ee by the inclo&s;ed copy of in&s;tructions which I have given him. It would give me much &s;atisfaction, that this gen|tleman, or any other whom you may think qualified, was ap|pointed to the command of the artillery regiment. In my let|ter to you, of the eighth in&s;tant, I have expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf ful|ly on this &s;ubject, which I beg leave to recommend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> your immediate attention; as the formation of that corps will be at a &s;tand, until I am honored with your in&s;tructions thereon. * * * *</P>
<P>There are two per&s;ons engaged to go Nova-Scotia, on the bu&s;ine&s;s recommended in your la&s;t. By the be&s;t information we have from thence, the &s;tores, &amp;c. have been withdrawn &s;ome time. Should this not be the ca&s;e, it is next to an impo&s;&s;ibility to attempt any thing there, in the pre&s;ent un&s;ettled and precarious &s;tate of the army. * * *</P>
<P>From what I can collect in my enquiries among&s;t the officers, it will be impo&s;&s;ible to get the men to enli&s;t for the continuance of the war; which will be an in&s;uperable ob&s;truction to the forma|tion of the two battallions of marines on the plan re&s;olved on in Congre&s;s. As it can make no difference, I propo&s;e to proceed ceed on the new arrangement of the army, and, when completed, inquire out &s;uch officers and men as are be&s;t qualified for that &s;ervice, and endeavor to form the&s;e two battalions out of the whole. This appears to me the be&s;t method, and will, I hope, meet the approbation of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="031423_0046_0FEC4A95E7246E78">
As it will be very difficult for the men to work when the hard fro&s;t &s;ets in, I have thought it nece&s;&s;ary (though of little u&s;e at pre&s;ent) to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Coble-hill, for the benefit of any future operations. It was effected, without the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition from the enemy, the twenty-third in&s;tant. Their inactivity on this occa&s;ion is what I cannot account for:&mdash;it is probable they are meditating a blow &s;omewhere.</P>
<P>About three hundred men, women and children, of the poor inhabitants of Bo&s;ton, came out to Point-Shirley la&s;t Friday&mdash;They have brought their hou&s;ehold furniture, but are unprovided of every other nece&s;&s;ary of life. I have recommended them to the attention of the committee of the honorable council of this province now &s;itting at Watertown.</P>
<P>The number enli&s;ted &s;ince my la&s;t are two thou&s;and four hun|dred and fifty men, * * * * Our &s;ituation is truly alarming: and of this general Howe is well appri&s;ed, it being the common topic of conver&s;ation when the people left Bo&s;ton la&s;t friday.&mdash;No doubt, when he is reinforced, he will avail him&s;elf of the information.</P>
<P>I am making the be&s;t di&s;po&s;ition I can for our defence, hav|ing thrown up, be&s;ides the work on Coble-hill, &s;everal redoubts, half-moons, &amp;c. along the bay: and I fear I &s;hall be under the nece&s;&s;ity of calling in the militia and minute-men of the coun|try to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance: I &s;ay, I fear it,&mdash;becau&s;e, by what I can learn from the officers in the army, belonging to this colony, it will be next to an impo&s;&s;ibility to keep them under any degree of di&s;cipline, and that it will be very difficult to prevail on them to remain a moment longer than they chu&s;e them&s;elves. It is a mortifying reflection, to be reduced to this dilemna. There has been nothing wanting on my part, to infu&s;e a proper &s;pirit among&s;t the officers, that they may exert their influence with the &s;oldiery. You &s;ee, by a fortnight's recruiting among&s;t men with arms in their hands, how little has been the &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>As the &s;mall-pox is now in Bo&s;ton, I have u&s;ed the precau|tion of prohibiting &s;uch as lately came out, from coming near our camp.&mdash;General Burgoyne, I am informed, will &s;oon em|bark for England.&mdash;I think the ri&s;k too great to write you by po&s;t, whil&s;t it continues to pa&s;s through New-York. It is cer|tain that a po&s;t has been intercepted the beginning of la&s;t month, as they &s;ent out &s;everal letters from Bo&s;ton, with the po&s;t-mark of Baltimore on them. This goes by captain Jo&s;eph Blewer, who promi&s;es to deliver it carefully unto you.</P>
<P>You, doubtle&s;s, will have heard, before this reaches, of gene|ral Montgomery's having got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Montreal. I congratu|late

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD the honor of writing to you, the thirtieth ultimo, inclo&s;ing an inventory of the military &s;tores taken on board the brig Nancy by captain Manly of the armed &s;chooner Lee. I have now to inform you that he has &s;ince &s;ent into Beverly, a &s;hip named the Concord, James Lowrie, ma&s;ter, from Greenock in Scotland, bound to Bo&s;ton. She has on board dry goods and coals, to the value of three thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and &s;ix pounds, nine &s;hillings and &s;even pence, &s;terling, &s;hipped by Craw|ford, Ander&s;on and Co. and con&s;igned to James Ander&s;on, merchant in Bo&s;ton. It is mentioned in the letters found on board, that this cargo was for the u&s;e of the army; but, on a &s;trict examination, I find it is really the property of the &s;hippers and the per&s;on to whom con&s;igned.&mdash;Pray what is to
<PB N="49" REF="031423_0048_0FEC4A9A40E91BC8">
be done with this &s;hip and cargo? and what with the brigantine which brought the military &s;tores?&mdash;It was agreed, in the con|ference la&s;t October, "<HI>that all ve&s;&s;els employed merely as tran&s;|ports, and unarmed, with their crews, be &s;et at liberty, upon giving &s;ecurity to return to Europe; but that this indulgence be not extended longer than till the fir&s;t of April next.</HI>" In the &s;hippers' letter, they mention: "you mu&s;t procure a certificate from the general and admiral, of the Concord being in the go|vernment &s;ervice, &s;uch as the Gla&s;gow packet brought with her, which was of great &s;ervice, procured a liberty to arm her, which was refu&s;ed us; al&s;o gave her a preference for &s;ome recruits that went out in her." In another part of the letter, they &s;ay:&mdash;"Captain Lowrie will deliver you the contract for the coals: we gave it to him, as it perhaps might be of u&s;e, as a certificate of his &s;hip being employed in the government &s;ervice." Every letter on board breathes nothing but enmity to this country: and a va&s;t number of them there are.</P>
<P>It is &s;ome time &s;ince I recommended to the Congre&s;s that they would in&s;titute a court for the trial of prizes made by the conti|nental armed ve&s;&s;els: which I hope they have ere now taken into their con&s;ideration: otherwi&s;e I &s;hould again take the liberty of urging it in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing manner.</P>
<P>The conduct of a great number of the Connecticut troops has laid me under the nece&s;&s;ity of calling in a body of the mi|litia much &s;ooner than I apprehended there would be an occa|&s;ion for &s;uch a &s;tep. I was afraid &s;ome time ago that they would incline to go home when the time of their enli&s;tment expired. I called upon the officers of the &s;everal regiments, to know whether they could prevail on the men to remain un|til the fir&s;t of January, or till a &s;ufficient number of other for|ces could be rai&s;ed to &s;upply their place. I &s;uppo&s;e they were deceived them&s;elves: I know they deceived me by a&s;&s;urances that I need be under no apprehen&s;ions on that &s;core, for the men would not leave the lines. La&s;t friday &s;hewed how much they were mi&s;taken, as the major part of the troops of that colony were going away with their arms and ammunition. We have however, by threats, per&s;ua&s;ion, and the activity of the people of the country, who &s;ent back many of them that had &s;et out, prevailed upon the mo&s;t part to &s;tay. There are about eighty of them mi&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>I have called in three thou&s;and men from this province; and general Sullivan, who lately returned from the province of New-Hamp&s;hire, having informed me that a number of men were there ready, at the &s;horte&s;t notice, I have demanded two
<PB N="50" REF="031423_0049_0FEC4A9D43174668">
thou&s;and from that province. The&s;e two bodies, I expect, will be in by the tenth in&s;tant, to make up the deficiency of the Connecticut-men, whom I have promi&s;ed to di&s;mi&s;s on that day, as well as the numbers to whom I was obliged to grant furloughs before any would enli&s;t.&mdash;As the &s;ame defection is much to be apprehended when the time of the Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts-Bay, New-Hamp&s;hire, and Rhode-I&s;land forces is ex|pired, I beg the attention of Congre&s;s to this important affair.</P>
<P>I am informed that it has been the cu&s;tom of the&s;e provinces in the la&s;t war, for the legi&s;lative power to order every town to provide a certain quota of men for the campaign. This or &s;ome other mode &s;hould be at pre&s;ent adopted, as I am &s;atisfied the men cannot be had without. This the Congre&s;s will plea&s;e to take into their immediate con&s;ideration. My &s;u&s;picions on this head I &s;hall al&s;o communicate to the governors Trumbull and Cooke, al&s;o to the New-Hamp&s;hire convention.</P>
<P>The number enli&s;ted in the la&s;t week are about thirteen hundred men. By this you &s;ee how &s;low this important work goes on. * * *</P>
<P>An expre&s;s is ju&s;t come in from general Schuyler, with let|ters from colonel Arnold and general Montgomery, copies of which I have the honor to inclo&s;e you. Upon the whole, I think affairs carry a plea&s;ing a&s;pect in that quarter. The reduction of Quebec is an object of &s;uch great importance, that I doubt not the Congre&s;s will give every a&s;&s;i&s;tance in their power for the accom|pli&s;hing it this winter.</P>
<P>By the la&s;t accounts from the armed &s;chooners &s;ent to the ri|ver St. Lawrence, I fear we have but little to expect from them: they were falling &s;hort of provi&s;ion, and mention that they would be obliged to return; which at this time will be parti|cularly unfortunate, as if they cho&s;e a proper &s;tation, all the ve&s;&s;els coming down that river mu&s;t fall into their hands. The plague, trouble, and vexation I have had with the crews of all the armed ve&s;&s;els, is inexpre&s;&s;ible. I do believe there is not on earth a more di&s;orderly &s;et,&mdash;every time they come into port, we hear of nothing but mutinous complaints. Manly's &s;ucce&s;s has lately, and but lately, quieted his people. The crews of the Wa&s;hington and Harri&s;on have actually de&s;erted them; &s;o that I have been under the nece&s;&s;ity of ordering the agent to lay the latter up, and get hands for the other on the be&s;t terms he could.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives and the honorable board have &s;ent me a vote of theirs relative to the harbor of Cape-Cod,
<PB N="51" REF="031423_0050_0FEC4AA3AC3AB930">
which you have herewith. I &s;hall &s;end an officer thither to examine what can be done for its defence, though I do not think I &s;hall be able to give them &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance as may be re|qui&s;ite; for I have at pre&s;ent neither men, powder, nor cannon to &s;pare. The great want of powder is what the attention of Congre&s;s &s;hould be particularly applied to. I dare not attempt any thing offen&s;ive, let the temptation or advantage be ever &s;o great, as I have not more of that mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential article, than will be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to defend our lines, &s;hould the enemy attempt to attack them.</P>
<P>By recent information from Bo&s;ton, general Howe is going to &s;end out a number of the inhabitants, in order, it is thought, to make more room for his expected reinforcements. There i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> one part of the information I can hardly give credit to:&mdash;a &s;ai|lor &s;ays that a number of tho&s;e coming out have been innoculat|ed, with de&s;ign of &s;preading the &s;mall-pox through this country and camp. I have communicated this to the general court; and recommended their attention thereto.</P>
<P>They are arming one of the tran&s;ports in Bo&s;ton, with which they mean to decoy &s;ome of our armed ve&s;&s;els. As we are appri&s;ed of their de&s;ign, I hope they will be di&s;appointed.</P>

I have wrote to the governors of Connecti|cut and Rhode-I&s;land, al&s;o to the Convention of New-Hamp|&s;hire, on this &s;ubject. A copy of my letter to them I have the honor to inclo&s;e herewith.

<P>The commi&s;&s;ary-general is &s;till, by his indi&s;po&s;ition, detained from Camp.

I do not think it would be expedient to put a &s;top thereto; as every thing, that would have a tendency to give the &s;oldiery room for complaint, mu&s;t be avoided.</P>

<P>I have not heard that any more troops are arrived at Bo&s;ton; which is a lucky circum&s;tance, as the Connecticut troops, I now find, are for the mo&s;t part gone off.&mdash;The hou&s;es in Bo&s;ton are le&s;&s;ening every day: They are pulled down, either for fire-wood, or to prevent the effects of fire, &s;hould we attempt a bombard|ment or an attack upon the town.&mdash;Coble-hill is &s;trongly for|tified,

<P>I RECEIVED your favor of the &s;econd in&s;tant, with the &s;everal re&s;olves of Congre&s;s therein inclo&s;ed.&mdash;The re&s;olves re|lative to captures made by continental armed ve&s;&s;els only want a court e&s;tabli&s;hed for trial, to make them complete. This, I hope, will be &s;oon done, as I have taken the liberty to urge it often to the Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>I am &s;omewhat at a lo&s;s to know whether I am to rai&s;e the two battalions of marines here, or not. As the delay can be attended with but little inconvenience, I will wait a further explanation from Congre&s;s, before I take any &s;teps therein.</P>
<P>I am much plea&s;ed that the money will be forwarded with all po&s;&s;ible expedition, as it is much wanting; al&s;o that Conolly and his a&s;&s;ociates are taken. It has been a very fortunate di&s;covery. I make no doubt but that the Congre&s;s will take every nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ure to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s lord Dunmore of his hold in Virginia; the &s;ooner &s;teps are taken for that purpo&s;e, the more probability there will be of their being effectual. * * * *</P>
<P>I will make application to general Howe, and propo&s;e an ex|change for Mr. Ethan Allen. I am much afraid I &s;hall have a like propo&s;al to make for captain Martindale of the armed brig|antine Wa&s;hington, and his men, who, it is reported, was taken a few days pa&s;t by a man-of-war, and carried into Bo&s;ton.&mdash;We cannot expect to be always &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>You will doubtle&s;s hear of the barbarity of captain Wallace on Conanicut i&s;land, ere this reaches your hands.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>CAPTAIN Manly, of the Lee armed &s;chooner, took an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ent into Beverly the &s;loop Bet&s;ey, A. Atkin&s;on ma&s;ter. She is an armed ve&s;&s;el, di&s;patched by lord Dunmore, with Indian corn, potatoes, and oats, for the army in Bo&s;ton. The packets of letters found on board, I have the honor to &s;end you with this by captain James Chambers, they being of &s;o much im|portance, that I do not think it would be prudent to tru&s;t them by a common expre&s;s.</P>
<P>As lord Dunmore's &s;chemes are fully laid open in the&s;e let|ters, I need not point out to the Congre&s;s the nece&s;&s;ity there is of a vigorous exertion being adopted by them, to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s his lord&s;hip of the &s;trong hold he has got in Virginia.&mdash;I do not mean to dictate; but I am &s;ure they will pardon me for giving them freely my opinion, which is that the fate of America a good deal depends on his being obliged to evacuate Norfolk this winter, or not.</P>
<P>I have Kirkland well &s;ecured, and think I will &s;end him to you for examination. By mo&s;t of the letters relative to him, he is a dangerous fellow. John Stewart's letters and papers are of a very intere&s;ting nature. Governor Tonyn's and many other letters from Augu&s;tine &s;hewing the weakne&s;s of the place; at the &s;ame time, of what va&s;t con&s;equence it would be for us to po&s;&s;e&s;s our&s;elves of it, and the great quantity of ammunition contained in the forts.&mdash;Indeed the&s;e papers are of &s;o great con&s;e|quence, that I think this but little inferior to any prize our famous Manly has taken.</P>
<P>We now work at our ea&s;e on Leechmore's hill. On di&s;co|vering our party there ye&s;terday morning, the &s;hip which lay oppo&s;ite began a cannonade, to which Mount Horam added &s;ome &s;hells.&mdash;One of our men was wounded.&mdash;We fired a few &s;hot from two eighteen-pounders which are placed on Coble-hill, and &s;oon obliged the &s;hip to &s;hift her &s;tation. She now lies in the ferry-way: and, except a few &s;hells from the mount in Bo&s;ton (which do no execution), we have no interruption in pro&s;ecuting our works, which will in a very &s;hort time be com|pleted. When this is done,&mdash;when we have powder to &s;port with,&mdash;I think, if the Congre&s;s re&s;olve on the execution of the pro|po&s;al made relative to the town of Bo&s;ton, it can be done.</P>
<P>I have &s;ent a letter in this day to general Howe, of which a copy goes herewith. My rea&s;on for pointing out brigadier-ge|neral Pre&s;cot as the object who is to &s;uffer Mr. Allen's fate, is, that, by letters from general Schuyler, and copies of letters
<PB N="56" REF="031423_0055_0FEC4ABA40EE0D68">
from general Montgomery to Schuyler, I am given to under|&s;tand that Pre&s;cot is the cau&s;e of Allen's &s;ufferings.&mdash;I thought it be&s;t to be deci&s;ive on the occa&s;ion, as did the generals whom I con|&s;ulted thereon.</P>
<P>The returns of men enli&s;ted &s;ince my la&s;t, amount to about eighteen hundred, making in the whole &s;even thou&s;and one hundred and forty. The militia that are come in, both from this province and New-Hamp&s;hire, are very fine-looking men, and go through their duty with great alacrity. The di&s;patch made, both by the people in marching and by the legi&s;lative powers in complying with my requi&s;ition, has given me infinite &s;a|tisfaction.</P>
<P>Your letter of the eighth in&s;tant, with the explanatory re|&s;olve re&s;pecting my calling forth the militia and minute-men, is come to hand; to which I &s;hall pay all due attention. You have removed all the difficulties which I labored under, about the two battalions of marines. I &s;hall obey the orders of Con|gre&s;s in looking out for proper officers to command that corps. I make no doubt but, when the money arrives to pay off the arrears and the month's advance, that it will be a great encourage|ment for the men to enli&s;t.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed is a letter I lately received from Mr. James Lovell.</P>
<P>His ca&s;e is truly pitiable. I wi&s;h &s;ome mode could be fallen upon to relieve him from the cruel &s;ituation he is now in.&mdash;I am &s;en&s;ible of the impropriety of exchanging a &s;oldier for a ci|tizen: but there is &s;omething &s;o cruelly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing in regard to this gentleman, that I dare &s;ay you will take it under your con&s;i|deration.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD the honor to addre&s;s my&s;elf to you on the nine|teenth in&s;tant, &s;ince which I have received undoubted infor|mation that the genuine in&s;tructions given to Conolly have not reached your hands; that they are very artfully concealed in the tree of his &s;addle, and covered with canvas &s;o nicely that they are &s;carcely di&s;cernable; that tho&s;e which were found up|on him were intended to deceive, if he were caught.&mdash;You will mo&s;t certainly have his &s;addle taken to pieces, in order to di&s;cover this deep-laid plot.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed is a copy of general Howe's letter in an&s;wer to the one I wrote him the eighteenth in&s;tant. The conduct I am to

ob&s;erve towards brigadier Pre&s;cot in con&s;equence of the&s;e letters, the Congre&s;s will oblige me by determining for me.</P>
<P>The gentlemen by whom you &s;ent the money are arrived.&mdash;The &s;um they brought, though large, is not &s;ufficient to an&s;wer the demands of the army, which at this time are remarkably heavy: there is three month's pay due, one month's advance, two dollars for each blanket&mdash;the arms, that are left by tho&s;e who are di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, to be paid for,&mdash;be&s;ides the demands which are on the commi&s;&s;ary and quarter-ma&s;ter-generals. You will therefore &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of another remittance, which I beg may be as &s;oon as you conveniently can.</P>
<P>I will take the opportunity of the return of the&s;e gentlemen, to &s;end colonel Kirkland to you for examination, and that you may di&s;po&s;e of him as to you may &s;eem proper.</P>
<P>A committee from the general court of this province called on me the other day, informing me that they were in great want of ordnance for the defence of the colony; that, if what belonged to them, now in u&s;e here, was kept for the continent, they would be under the nece&s;&s;ity of providing them&s;elves with o|thers; of cour&s;e what is kept mu&s;t be paid for. There are ma|ny of the cannon of very little u&s;e; &s;uch of them as are good, I cannot at pre&s;ent part with: perhaps when I receive the &s;up|ply from New-York and Canada, it may be in my power to &s;pare them.</P>
<P>Mr. Wad&s;worth has &s;ent in his report re&s;pecting Cape-Cod har|bor, a copy of which you will receive herewith; al&s;o a letter from Mr. Jacob Bailey, put into my hands by colonel Little.&mdash;It contains &s;ome things that may not be unworthy the con&s;idera|tion of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>We have made good progre&s;s in the works of Leechmore's point. They would have been fini&s;hed ere this, but for the &s;eve|rity of the weather, which prevents our people from working.</P>
<P>I received a letter from governor Cooke, which expre&s;&s;es the fears of the people of Rhode-I&s;land, le&s;t the &s;hips, which we had information were &s;ailed with &s;ome troops on board, were de&s;tined for Newport. I &s;ent major-general Lee there, to point out to them &s;uch defence as he may think the place capable of. I &s;incerely wi&s;h he may be able to do it with effect, as that place, in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, is an a&s;ylum for &s;uch as are di&s;affected to American liberty.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WROTE to you the twenty-fifth in&s;tant; &s;ince which I am not honored with any of your favors. The e&s;timate I then inclo&s;ed you was calculated to pay the troops, &amp;c. up to the fir&s;t of January. That cannot be done for want of funds in the payma&s;ter-general's hands; which cau&s;es a great murmur|ing among&s;t tho&s;e who are going off.&mdash;The monthly expences of this army amount to near two hundred and &s;eventy-five thou|&s;and dollars, which I take the liberty of recommending to the ob&s;ervation of Congre&s;s, that their future remittances may be governed thereby.</P>
<P>It &s;ometimes happens that per&s;ons would wi&s;h to depo&s;it mo|ney in the hands of the payma&s;ter-general, for his bills on the trea&s;ury at Philadelphia. He has hitherto declined &s;uch offers, not having authority from Congre&s;s to draw.&mdash;Would it not be proper to give this power?&mdash;If it &s;hould be approved of, you will plea&s;e to point out the mode that the Congre&s;s would chu&s;e to have it done in.</P>
<P>The cloathing &s;ent to the quarter-ma&s;ter-general is not &s;uffici|ent to put half our army into regimentals; nor is there a po&s;&s;i|bility of getting any quantity here. I have wrote to general Schuyler, that I wi&s;h what was lodged at Albany could be &s;pared for the&s;e troops, as General Montgomery would clothe the men under his command at Montreal. If this can be done, it will be of infinite &s;ervice; and no time &s;hould be lo&s;t in forwarding them to this camp.</P>
<P>In forming the regiments for the new e&s;tabli&s;hment, I thought it but ju&s;tice to appoint the officers, de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ached under colonel Arnold, to commi&s;&s;ions in them. Their ab&s;ence at pre&s;ent is of very great detriment to the &s;ervice, e&s;pecially in recruiting: I would therefore wi&s;h, if the Congre&s;s intend rai&s;ing troops in or for Canada, that they could be taken in there. The &s;ooner I have their opinion of this matter, the better, that, if they can be commi&s;&s;ioned in Canada, I may appoint officers here to re|place them.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed you have a copy of repre&s;entation &s;ent to me by the legi&s;lative body of this province, re&s;pecting four companies &s;ta|tioned at Braintree, Weymouth, and Hingham. As they were never regimented, and were doing duty at a di&s;tance from the re&s;t of the army, I did not know whether to con&s;ider them as a part of it; nor do I think my&s;elf authori&s;ed to direct payment for them without the approbation of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>It has been repre&s;ented to me that the free negroes who have
<PB N="59" REF="031423_0058_0FEC4AC155493800">
&s;erved in this army are very much di&s;&s;atisfied at being di&s;card|ed. As it is to be apprehended they may &s;eek employ in the mini&s;terial army, I have pre&s;umed to depart from the re&s;olution re&s;pecting them, and have given licence for their being enli&s;ted. If this is di&s;approved of by Congre&s;s, I will put a &s;top to it.</P>
<P>* * * I mu&s;t remark that the pay of the a&s;&s;i&s;tant engi|neers is &s;o very &s;mall, that we cannot expect men of &s;cience will engage in it. Tho&s;e gentlemen, who are in that &s;tation, re|mained under the expectation that an additional allowance would be made them by the re&s;pective provinces in which they were ap|pointed, to that allowed by the Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>Captain Freeman arrived this day at camp from Canada. He left Quebec the twenty-fourth ultimo, in con&s;equence of general Carleton's proclamation, which I have the honor to &s;end you here|with. He &s;aw colonel Arnold the twenty-&s;ixth, and &s;ays that he was joined at Point-&aacute;-tremble, by general Montgomery, the fir&s;t in&s;tant;&mdash;that they were about two thou&s;and &s;trong, and were making every preparation for attacking Quebec;&mdash;that general Carleton had with him about twelve hundred men, the majority of whom are &s;ailors;&mdash;that it was his opinion the French would give up the place if they get the &s;ame conditions granted to the inhabitants of Montreal. * * *</P>
<P>Captains Semple and Harbe&s;on take under their care, Mr. Kirkland. * * * Captain Mathews and Mr. Robin&s;on will ac|company them. The two latter were taken pri&s;oners by lord Dunmore, who was &s;ending them to Bo&s;ton, from whence there is little doubt but they would be forwarded to England, to which place I am credibly informed captain Martindale and the crew of the Wa&s;hington are &s;ent; al&s;o colonel Allen, and the pri&s;oners taken with him in Canada. This may account for general Howe's &s;ilence on the &s;ubject of an exchange of pri&s;oners mentioned in my letter to him.</P>
<P>General Lee is ju&s;t returned from his excur&s;ion to Rhode-I&s;land;&mdash;he has pointed out the be&s;t method the i&s;land would ad|mit of for its defence; he has endeavored all in his power to make friends of tho&s;e who were our enemies. You have, inclo&s;ed, a &s;pecimen of his abilities in that way, for your peru&s;al. I am of opinion, that, if the &s;ame plan was pur&s;ued through every pro|vince, it would have a very good effect.</P>
<P>I have long had it on my mind to mention to Congre&s;s that frequent applications had been made to me re&s;pecting the chap|lain's pay, which is too &s;mall to encourage men of abilities. Some of them, who have left their flocks, are obliged to pay the par&s;on acting for them, more than they receive. I need not
<PB N="60" REF="031423_0059_0FEC4AD05C6F9638">
point out the great utility of gentlemen who&s;e lives and conver|&s;ation are unexceptionable, being employed for that &s;ervice, in this army. There are two ways of making it worth the attention of &s;uch: one is an advancement of their pay; the other that one chaplain be appointed to two regiments. This la&s;t, I think, may be done without inconvenience. I beg leave to recommend this matter to Congre&s;s, who&s;e &s;entiments hereon I &s;hall impati|ently expect.</P>
<P>Upon a farther conver&s;ation with captain Freeman, he is of opinion that general Montgomery has with him near three thou|&s;and men, including colonel Arnold's. He &s;ays that lord Pitt had received repeated orders from his father to return home; in con&s;equence of which, he had embarked &s;ome time in October, with a captain Green who was ma&s;ter of a ve&s;&s;el belonging to Philadelphia.</P>
<P>By a number of &s;alutes in Bo&s;ton harbor ye&s;terday, I fancy admiral Shuldham is arrived. Two large &s;hips were &s;een com|ing in.</P>
<P>Our enli&s;tments now amount to nine thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and fifty.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e gentlemen, who were made pri&s;oners by lord Dun|more being left de&s;titute of money and nece&s;&s;aries, I have ad|vanced them a hundred pounds lawful money belonging to the public, for which I have taken captain Mathews's draught on the trea&s;ury of Virginia, which goes inclo&s;ed.</P>

<P>SINCE my la&s;t of the thirty-fir&s;t ultimo, I have been ho|nored with your favor of the twenty-&s;econd, inclo&s;ing &s;undry re&s;olves, which &s;hall, in matters they re&s;pect, be made the rule of my conduct.</P>
<P>The re&s;olution relative to the troops in Bo&s;ton, I beg the favor of you, &s;ir, to a&s;&s;ure the Congre&s;s &s;hall be attempted to be put in execution the fir&s;t moment I &s;ee a probability of &s;uc|ce&s;s, and in &s;uch a way as a council of officers &s;hall think mo&s;t likely to produce it: but if this &s;hould not happen as &s;oon as you may expect or my wi&s;hes prompt to, I reque&s;t that Con|gre&s;s may be plea&s;ed to advert to my &s;ituation, and do me the ju&s;tice to believe, that circum&s;tance, and not want of inclina|tio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the cau&s;e of delay.</P>

It is not in the pages of hi&s;tory, perhaps, to furni&s;h a ca&s;e like ours;&mdash;to maintain a po&s;t within mu&s;ket-&s;hot of the enemy, for &s;ix months together, without<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Left blank in the original to guard again&s;t the danger of mi&s;|carriage.&mdash;Read,</HI> "without powder."</NOTE> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">, and at the &s;ame time to di&s;band one army, and recruit another, within that di&s;tance of twenty odd Briti&s;h regiments,&mdash;is. more, probably, than ever was attempted. But if we &s;ucceed as well in the la&s;t, as we have heretofore in the fir&s;t, I &s;hall think it the mo&s;t fortunate event of my whole life.</P>
<P>By a very intelligent gentleman, a Mr. Hutchin&s;on, from Bo&s;ton, I learn, that it was admiral Shuldham that came into the harbor on &s;aturday la&s;t;&mdash;that two of the five regiments from Cork are arrived at Halifax;&mdash;two others have &s;ailed for Quebec; but what was become of them, could not be told:&mdash;and the other (the fifty-fifth) has ju&s;t got into Bo&s;ton. Certain it is al&s;o, that the greater part of the &s;eventeenth regiment is arrived there, Whether we are to conclude from hence that more than five regiments have been &s;ent out, or that the companies of the &s;eventeenth, arrived at Bo&s;ton, are part of the regiments de&s;tined for Hallifax and Quebec, I know not.</P>
<P>We al&s;o learn from this gentleman and others, that the troops, embarked for Halifax (as mentioned in my letter of the &s;ixteenth) were really de&s;igned for that place, but recalled from Nanta&s;ket road, upon advice being received of the above regiments there. I am al&s;o informed of a fleet now getting ready under the convoy of the Scarborough and Fowey men-of-war,&mdash;con&s;i&s;ting of five tran&s;ports and two bomb ve&s;&s;els, with about three hundred marines, and &s;everal flat bottomed boats. It is whi&s;pered that they are de&s;igned for Newport, but gene|rally thought in Bo&s;ton, that it is meant for Long-I&s;land: and it is probable it will be followed by more troops, as the other tran&s;ports are taking in water,&mdash;to lie, as others &s;ay, in Nan|ta&s;ket road, to be out of the ice. A large quantity of bi&s;cuit is al&s;o baking.</P>
<P>As the real de&s;ign cannot with certainty be known, I &s;ubmit it, with all due deference, to the &s;uperior judgment of Congre&s;s, whether it would not be confident with prudence, to have &s;ome of the Jer&s;ey troops thrown into New-York, to prevent an evil, which would be almo&s;t irremediable, &s;hould it happen,&mdash;I mean, the landing of troops at that place, or upon Long-I&s;land, near it.</P>

<P>EVERY account I have out of Bo&s;ton, confirms the em|barkation of troops mentioned in my la&s;t, which, from the &s;ea|&s;on of the year, and other circum&s;tances, mu&s;t be de&s;tined for &s;ome expedition to the &s;outhward of this. I have therefore thought it prudent to &s;end major-general Lee to New-York. I have given him letters recommendatory to governor Trumbull, and to the committee of &s;afety at New-York. I have good hopes that in Connecticut he will get many volunteers, who (I have &s;ome rea&s;on to think) will accompany him on this expedi|tion, without more expen&s;e to the continent than their mainte|nance. But &s;hould it be otherwi&s;e, and that they &s;hould ex|pect pay, I think it is a trifling con&s;ideration, when put in com|petition with the importance of the object, which is to put the city of New-York, with &s;uch parts of the North river and Long-I&s;land as to him &s;hall &s;eem proper, in that &s;tate of de|fence, which the &s;ea&s;on of the year and circum&s;tances will ad|mit of,&mdash;&s;o as, if po&s;&s;ible, to prevent the enemy from forming a lodgment in that government, which, I am afraid, contains too many per&s;ons di&s;affected to the cau&s;e of liberty and Ame|rica. I have al&s;o wrote to lord Stirling to give him all the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance that he can with the troops under his command, in the continental &s;ervice, provided it does not interfere with any or|ders he may receive from Congre&s;s relative to them.</P>
<P>I hope the Congre&s;s will approve of my conduct in &s;ending general Lee on this expedition:&mdash;I am &s;ure I mean it well; as experience teaches us that it is much ea&s;ier to prevent an ene|my from po&s;ting them&s;elves, than it is to di&s;lodge them after they have got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The evening of the eighth in&s;tant, a party of our men, under the command of major Knoulton, were ordered to go and burn
<PB N="63" REF="031423_0062_0FEC4ADDACCF67B0">
&s;ome hou&s;es which lay at the foot of Bunker's-hill, and at the head of Charle&s;ton. They were al&s;o ordered to bring off the guard, which, we expected, con&s;i&s;ted, of an officer and thirty men. They cro&s;&s;ed the mill-dam about half after eight o'clock, and gallantly executed their bu&s;ine&s;s,&mdash;having burned eight hou&s;es, and brought with them a &s;erjeant and four privates of the tenth regiment. There was but one man more there, who making &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance, they were obliged to di&s;patch. The gun that killed him was the only one di&s;charged by our men, though &s;everal hundred were fired by the enemy from within their works, but in &s;o confu&s;ed a manner, that not one of our people was hurt.</P>

<P>I AM exceedingly &s;orry that I am under the nece&s;&s;ity of applying to you, and calling the attention of Congre&s;s to the &s;tate of our arms, which is truly alarming. Upon the di&s;&s;olu|tion of the old army, I was apprehen&s;ive that the new would be deficient in this in&s;tance: and, that the want might be as in|con&s;iderable as po&s;&s;ible, I gave it out in orders, that the arms of &s;uch men as did not re-enli&s;t (or &s;uch of them as were good) &s;hould be retained at the prices which &s;hould be affixed by per|&s;ons appointed to in&s;pect and value them: and, that we might be &s;ure of them, I added that there would be a &s;toppage of pay for the months of November and December, from tho&s;e who &s;hould carry their firelocks away without their being fir&s;t exa|mined. I hoped, by the&s;e precautions, to have procured a con|&s;iderable number: but, &s;ir, I find with much concern, that from the badne&s;s of the arms, and the di&s;obedience of too many in bearing them off without a previous in&s;pection&mdash;very few were collected. Neither are we to expect that many will be brought in by the new recruits, the officers, who are out enli&s;ting, hav|ing reported that few men who have arms will enli&s;t in the &s;er|vice; and that they are under the di&s;agreeable alternative of taking men without arms, or of getting none. Unhappy &s;itua|tion, and much to be deplored!&mdash;e&s;pecially when we have every rea&s;on to convince us, that we have to contend with a formidable army, well provided of every nece&s;&s;ary; and that there will be a mo&s;t vigorous exertion of mini&s;terial vengeance again&s;t us, as &s;oon as they think them&s;elves in a condition for
<PB N="64" REF="031423_0063_0FEC4ADF92AEF580">
it. I hope it is in the power of Congre&s;s to afford us relief:&mdash;if it is not, what mu&s;t, what can be done?</P>
<P>Our trea&s;ury is almo&s;t exhau&s;ted, and the demands again&s;t it very con&s;iderable. A con&s;tant &s;upply of money, to an&s;wer every claim and exigency, would much promote the good of the &s;er|vice. In the common affairs of life, it is u&s;eful: in war, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary and e&s;&s;ential. I would beg leave, too, to remind you of the tents, and their importance;&mdash;hoping that if an opportunity has offered, you have procured them. I fear that our army will not be rai&s;ed to the new e&s;tabli&s;hment in any rea&s;onable time, if ever: the enli&s;ting goes on &s;o very &s;low, that it almo&s;t &s;eems at an end.</P>
<P>In my letter of the fourth in&s;tant, I wrote you that I had re|ceived certain intelligence from a Mr. Hutchin&s;on and others, that two of the five regiments from Cork were arrived at Hali|fax, one at Bo&s;ton, and the two others had &s;ailed for Quebec, and had not been heard of. I am now a&s;&s;ured (as a matter to be relied on) by four captains of &s;hips, who left England about the &s;econd of November, and who appear to be men of vera|city, that the whole of the&s;e regiments (except the two com|panies that arrived at Bo&s;ton &s;ome time ago), when they &s;ailed, were at Milford Haven, where they had been obliged to put in, by a violent &s;torm, the nineteenth of October; that they would not be able to leave it for a con&s;iderable time, as they were under the nece&s;&s;ity of repairing their ve&s;&s;els, and getting &s;ome new ones taken up.&mdash;Such is the uncertainty and contradicti|on in what I now hear, that it is not po&s;&s;ible to know what to believe or di&s;believe-</P>
<P>I wrote to the general court ye&s;terday, and to the convention of New-Hamp&s;hire, immediately upon &s;eeing the great deficiency in our arms,&mdash;praying that they would intere&s;t them&s;elves in the matter, and furni&s;h me with all in their power. Whether I &s;hall get any, or what quantity, I cannot determine, not having re|ceived their an&s;wers.&mdash;The &s;ame application will be made to the governments of Connecticut and Rhode-I&s;land.</P>
<P>I do my&s;elf the honor to &s;end you &s;undry new&s;papers I re|ceived from the above-mentioned captains, as they may be later than any you have &s;een, and contain &s;ome intere&s;ting intelli|gence.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TAKING it for granted that general Schuyler has not only informed you of the fall of the brave and much-to-be-la|mented general Montgomery, but of the &s;ituation of our affair<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> in Canada (as related by general Woo&s;ter, colonel Arnold, co|lonel Campbell, and others), I &s;hall not take up much more of your time on this &s;ubject, than is nece&s;&s;ary to inclo&s;e you a copy of his letter to me, with the re&s;ult thereon, as appears by the council of war, which I immediately &s;ummoned on the occa&s;ion, and at which Mr. Adams, by my particular de&s;ire, was good enough to attend.</P>
<P>It may appear &s;trange, &s;ir, as I had not men to &s;par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> from the&s;e lines, that I &s;hould pre&s;ume (without fir&s;t &s;ending to Con|gre&s;s, and obtaining an expre&s;s direction) to recommend to the governments of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, Connecticut, and New-Hamp|&s;hire, to rai&s;e each a regiment, on the continental account, for this &s;ervice. I wi&s;h mo&s;t ardently that the urgency of the ca&s;e would have admitted of the delay. I wi&s;h al&s;o that the purport of general Schuyler's letter had not, unavoidably as it were, laid me under an indi&s;pen&s;able obligation to do it:&mdash;for having informed you in his letter (a copy of which he inclo&s;ed me) of his dependence on this quarter, for men, I thought you might al&s;o have &s;ome reliance on my exertions. This con&s;ideration, added to my fears of the fatal con&s;equences of delay,&mdash;to an information of your having de&s;igned three thou&s;and men for Ca|nada,&mdash;to a belief, founded chiefly on general Schuyler's letters, that few or none of them were rai&s;ed,&mdash;and to my apprehen&s;i|ons for New-York, which led me to think that no troops could be &s;pared from that quarter,&mdash;induced me to lo&s;e not a mo|ment's time in throwing in a force there; being well a&s;&s;ured that general Carleton will improve, to the utmo&s;t, the advanta|ges gained, leaving no artifices untried, to fix the Canadians and Indians (who, I find, are too well di&s;po&s;ed to take part with the &s;tronge&s;t) in his intere&s;t.</P>
<P>If the&s;e rea&s;ons are not &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify my conduct in the opinion of Congre&s;s,&mdash;if the mea&s;ure contravenes any re&s;olution of theirs,&mdash;they will plea&s;e to countermand the levying and marching of the regiments as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and do me the ju&s;tice to believe that my intentions were good, if my judgment has erred.</P>
<P>The Congre&s;s will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve, that the mea&s;ures of &s;upporting our po&s;ts in Canada appeared of &s;uch exceeding great importance, that the general officers (agreeing with me in &s;en|timent,

I &s;hall (being much hurried and fatigued) add no more in this letter, than my duty to Congre&s;s, and that I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</P>

<P>Since writing the above, I have been informed by a me&s;&s;age from the general court of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, that they have re&s;ol|ved upon the rai&s;ing of a regiment for Canada, and appointed the field officers for it, in the we&s;tern parts of this government. I am al&s;o informed by expre&s;s from Governor Trumbull, that he and his council of &s;afety had agreed upon the rai&s;ing of a regiment for the &s;ame purpo&s;e; which was anticipating my appli|cation to that government.</P>
<P>If commi&s;&s;ions (and they are applied for) are to be given by Congre&s;s to the three regiments going to Canada, you will plea&s;e to have them forwarded, as I have none by me for that purpo&s;e.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE commi&s;&s;ary general being at length [<HI>recovered</HI>] from a long and painful illne&s;s, I have it in my power to comply with the requi&s;ition of Congre&s;s, in forwarding an e&s;timate of the expen&s;e attending his office, as al&s;o that of the quarter-ma&s;ter-general.</P>
<P>You will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve that the commi&s;&s;ary, by his ac|count of the matter, has entered into no &s;pecial agreement with any of the per&s;ons he has found occa&s;ion to employ (as tho&s;e, to who&s;e names &s;ums are annexed, are of their own fixing), but left it to Congre&s;s to a&s;certain their wages. I &s;hall &s;ay nothing therefore on this head, farther than relates to the propo&s;ition of Mr. * * *, to be allowed one-eighth for his trouble and the delivery of the other &s;even-eighths of provi&s;ions, which to me appears exorbitant in the extreme, however conformable it may be to cu&s;tom and u&s;age: I therefore think that rea&s;onable
<PB N="67" REF="031423_0066_0FEC4AF3572041F0">
&s;tipends had better be fixed upon. Both the quarter-ma&s;ter and commi&s;&s;ary-generals a&s;&s;ure me that they do not employ a &s;ingle per&s;on u&s;ele&s;sly: and as I have too good an opinion of them to think they would deceive me, I believe them.</P>
<P>I &s;hall take the liberty, in this place, of recommending the expediency, indeed the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, of appointing fit and proper per&s;ons to &s;ettle the accounts of this army. To do it with preci&s;ion, requires time, care, and attention: the longer it is left undone, the more intricate they will be, the more lia|ble to error, and difficult to explain and rectify;&mdash;as al&s;o the per&s;ons in who&s;e hands they are (if di&s;po&s;ed to take undue ad|vantage) will be le&s;s &s;ubject to detection. I have been as at|tentive as the nature of my office would admit of, in granting warrants for money on the payma&s;ter: but it would be ab&s;o|lutely impo&s;&s;ible for me to go into an examination of all the ac|counts incident to this army, and the vouchers appertaining to them, without devoting &s;o large a portion of my time to the bu&s;ine&s;s, as might not only prove injurious, but fatal to it in other re&s;pects. This ought, in my humble opinion, to be the particular bu&s;ine&s;s of a &s;elect committee of Congre&s;s, or one appointed by them, who, once in three months at furthe&s;t, &s;hould make a &s;ettlement with the officers in the different de|partments.</P>
<P>Having met with no encouragement from the governments of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and New-Hamp&s;hire, from my application for arms and expecting no better from Connecticut and Rhode-I&s;|land, I have as the la&s;t expedient, &s;ent one or two officers from each regiment into the country, with money to try if they can buy. In what manner they &s;ucceed, Congre&s;s &s;hall be informed as &s;oon as they return.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s, in my la&s;t, would di&s;cover my motives for &s;treng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|ening the&s;e lines with the militia: but whether,&mdash;as the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|ther turns out exceedingly mild, in&s;omuch as to promi&s;e no|thing favorable from ice,&mdash;and no appearance of powder,&mdash;I &s;hall be able to attempt any thing deci&s;ive, time only can deter|mine. No man upon earth wi&s;hes more ardently to de&s;troy the ne&s;t in Bo&s;ton, than I do:&mdash;no per&s;on would be willing to go greater lengths than I &s;hall, to accompli&s;h it, if it &s;hall be thought advi&s;eable. But if we have neither powder to bombard with, nor ice to pa&s;s on, we &s;hall be in no better &s;ituation than we have been in all the year:&mdash;we &s;hall be wor&s;e, becau&s;e their works are &s;tronger.</P>
<P>I have accounts from Bo&s;ton, which I think may be relied on, that general Clinton, with about four or five hundred men,
<PB N="68" REF="031423_0067_0FEC4AF70E22FCF0">
hath left that place within the&s;e four days. Whether this is part of the detachment which was making up (as mentioned in my letter of the fourth in&s;tant, and then at Nanta&s;ket) or not, is not in my power to &s;ay. If it is de&s;igned for New-York or Long-I&s;land as &s;ome think, throwing a body of troops there may prove a fortunate circum&s;tance. If they go farther &s;outh agreeable to the conjectures of others, I hope there will be men to receive them.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the po&s;itive a&s;&s;ertions of the four captains from Port&s;mouth, noticed in my letter of the fourteenth, I am now convinced from &s;everal corroborating circum&s;tances,&mdash;the accounts of de&s;erters, and of a lieutenant Hill, of Lord Percy's regiment, who left Ireland the fifth of November, and was ta|ken by a privateer from Newburyport,&mdash;that the &s;eventeenth and fifty-fifth regiments are arrived at Bo&s;ton, and other troops at Halifax, agreeable to the information of Hutchin&s;on and o|thers. Lieutenant Hill &s;ays that the tran&s;ports of two regiments only were forced into Milford Haven.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s will think me a little remi&s;s, I fear, when I inform them that I have done nothing yet towards rai&s;ing the battallions of marines: but I hope to &s;tand exculpated from blame, when they hear the rea&s;on, which was, that already having twenty-&s;ix incomplete regiments, I thought it would be adding to an ex|pence, already-great, in officers, to &s;et two entire corps of offi|cers on foot when perhaps we &s;hould not add ten men a week by it to our pre&s;ent numbers. In this opinion the general offi|cers have concurred, which induced me to &s;u&s;pend the matter a little longer.&mdash;Our enli&s;tments, for the two la&s;t weeks, have not amounted to a thou&s;and men, and are dimini&s;hing. The regiment for Canada (it is thought) will &s;oon be filled, as the men are to chu&s;e all but their field officers, who are appointed by the court.</P>
<P>On &s;unday evening, thirteen of the Caghnewaga Indians ar|rived here on a vi&s;it. I &s;hall take care that they be &s;o enter|tained during their &s;tay, that they may return impre&s;&s;ed with &s;entiments of friend&s;hip for us, and al&s;o of our great &s;trength. One of them is colonel Louis, who honored me with a vi&s;it once before.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR favours of the &s;ixth and twentieth in&s;tant I received ye&s;terday, with the &s;everal re&s;olves of Congre&s;s alluded to: for which I return you my thanks.</P>
<P>Knowing the great importance Canada will be of to us in the pre&s;ent intere&s;ting conte&s;t, and the relief our friends there &s;tand in need of, I &s;hould be happy, were it in my power to detach a bat|talion from this camp: but it cannot be done. On the nine|teenth in&s;tant, I had the honor to write to you, which will fully convey the re&s;olutions of a council of war, and the &s;entiments of the general officers here, as to the propriety and expediency of &s;ending troops from the&s;e lines, for the defence of which we have been and now are obliged to call in the militia;&mdash;to which I beg leave to refer you. You may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured that my endeavors and exertions &s;hall not be wanting, to &s;timulate the governments of Connecticut and New-Hamp&s;hire to rai&s;e and forward reinforce|ments as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible; nor in any other in&s;tance that will pro|mote the expedition.</P>
<P>I &s;hall, in obedience to the order of Congre&s;s, though inter|dicted by general Howe, propo&s;e an exchange of governor Skene for Mr. Lovell and family, and &s;hall be happy to have an oppor|tunity of putting this de&s;erving man (who has di&s;tingui&s;hed his fidelity and regard to his country to be too great for per&s;ecution and cruelty to overcome) in any po&s;t agreeable to his wi&s;hes and in|clination.</P>
<P>I do not know that there is any particular rank annexed to the office of aids-de-camp. Generally they are captains, and rank as &s;uch: but higher rank is often given on account of particular me|rit and particular circum&s;tances.&mdash;Aids to the king have the rank of colonels.&mdash;Whether any di&s;tinction &s;hould be made between tho&s;e of your commander-in-chief and the other generals, I really know not: I think there ought.</P>
<P>You may rely that Conolly had in&s;tructions concealed in his &s;addle. Mr. * * * who was one of lord Dunmore's family, and another gentleman who wi&s;hes his name not to be mentioned, &s;aw them ca&s;ed in tin, put in the tree, and covered over. He pro|bably has exchanged his &s;addle, or withdrew the papers when it was mended, as you conjecture. Tho&s;e that have been di&s;co|vered are &s;ufficiently bad; but I doubt not of the others being wor&s;e, and containing more diabolical and exten&s;ive plans.&mdash;I hope he will be taken proper care of, and meet with rewards equal to his merits.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="031423_0069_0FEC4AFB8C534600">
I &s;hall appoint officers in the places of tho&s;e who are in Ca|nada, as I am fully per&s;uaded they will wi&s;h to continue there, for making our conque&s;t complete in that quarter.&mdash;I wi&s;h their bravery and valor may be attended with the &s;miles of for|tune.</P>
<P>It gives me great plea&s;ure to hear of the mea&s;ures Congre&s;s are taking for manufacturing powder. I hope their endeavors will be crowned with &s;ucce&s;s. I too well know and regret the want of it. It is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the di&s;advantages an army mu&s;t labor under, when not provided with a &s;ufficient &s;upply of this nece&s;&s;ary. It may &s;eem &s;trange, that, after hav|ing received about eleven tons, added to about five tons which I found here, and no general action has happened, we &s;hould be &s;o deficient in this article and require more. But you will plea&s;e to con&s;ider, that, be&s;ides its being in its nature &s;ubject to wa&s;te, and (whil&s;t the men lay in bad tents) unavoidably da|maged by &s;evere and heavy rains (which could not have been prevented, unle&s;s it had been entirely withdrawn from the men, and an attack hazarded again&s;t us without ammunition in their hands)&mdash;the armed ve&s;&s;els, our own occa&s;ional firings, and &s;ome &s;mall &s;upplies I have been obliged to afford the &s;eaport towns threatened with de&s;truction,&mdash;to which may be added the &s;upply to the militia, and going off of the old troops,&mdash;have occa|&s;ioned, and ever will, a large con&s;umption of it, and wa&s;te, in &s;pite of all the care in the world. The king's troops never have le&s;s than &s;ixty rounds a man in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, independent of their &s;tores.&mdash;To &s;upply an army of twenty thou&s;and men in this manner, would take near four hundred barrels, allowing noth|ing for &s;tores, artillery, &amp;c. I have been always afraid to place more than twelve or fifteen rounds at a time in the hands of our men, le&s;t, any accident happening to it, we &s;hould be le&s;t de&s;ti|tute, and be undone.&mdash;I have been thus particular, not only to &s;hew our poverty, but to exculpate my&s;elf from even a &s;u&s;picion of unnece&s;&s;ary wa&s;te.</P>
<P>I &s;hall inform the payma&s;ter-general of the re&s;olution of Con|gre&s;s re&s;pecting his draughts, and the mode and account of them.</P>
<P>The companies at Chel&s;ea and Malden are and have always been regimented.&mdash;It is not my intention to replace with continental troops the independent companies at Hingham, Weymouth, and Braintree. The&s;e places are expo&s;ed, but not more than Cape Ann, Beverly, Salem, Marblehead, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="031423_0070_0FEC4B01C10FBA80">
Is it the intention of Congre&s;s that the officers of the army &s;hould pay po&s;tage?&mdash;They are not exempted by the re&s;olve of the ninth in&s;tant.</P>
<P>The Congre&s;s will be plea&s;ed, I have no doubt, to recollect that the five hundred thou&s;and dollars, now coming, are but little more than enough to bring us up to the fir&s;t day of this month; that to|morrow will be the la&s;t of it: and, by their re&s;olves, the troops are to be paid monthly.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h it was in my power to furni&s;h Congre&s;s with &s;uch a general as they de&s;ire, to &s;end to Canada. Since the unhappy rever&s;e of our affairs in that quarter, general Schuyler has in|formed me, that, though he had thoughts of declining the &s;er|vice before, he would now act. My letter of the eleventh will inform them of general Lee's being at New-York. He will be ready to obey their orders, &s;hould they incline to &s;end him:&mdash;but, if I am not greatly deceived, he or &s;ome other &s;pirited able officer will be wanted there in the &s;pring, if not &s;ooner; as we have undoubted intelligence that general Clinton has &s;ailed with &s;ome troops.&mdash;The reports of their number are various, from between four and five hundred to nineteen companies of grena|diers and light infantry. It is al&s;o imagined that the regiments, which were to &s;ail the fir&s;t of December, are intended for that place or Virginia.&mdash;General Putnam is a mo&s;t valuable man, and a fine executive officer: but I do not know how he would conduct in a &s;eparate department. He is a younger major-general than Mr. Schuyler, who, as I ob&s;erved, having determined to continue in the &s;ervice, will, I expect, repair into Canada.&mdash;A co|py of my letter to him, on this and the other &s;ubjects, I inclo&s;e you, as it will explain my motives for not &s;topping the regiments from the&s;e governments.</P>
<P>When captain Cochran arrives, I will give him every a&s;&s;i&s;tance in my power, in obedience to the orders of Congre&s;s: but I fear it will be the means of laying up our own ve&s;&s;els, as the&s;e people will not bear the di&s;tinction. Should this be the con&s;e|quence, it will be highly prejudicial to us, as we &s;ometimes pick up their provi&s;ion-ve&s;&s;els, and may continue to di&s;tre&s;s them in this way.</P>
<P>La&s;t week captain Manly took a &s;hip and brig bound to Bo&s;ton from Whitehaven, with coals chiefly, and &s;ome potatoes, for the army. I have for his great vigilance and indu&s;try, appointed him commodore of our little &s;quadron; and he now hoi&s;ts his flag on board the &s;chooner Hancock.</P>
<P>I congratulate you upon the recovery of Smith, and am ex|ceedingly glad to hear of the mea&s;ures Congre&s;s are taking for
<PB N="72" REF="031423_0071_0FEC4B03F0B1F140">
the general defence of the continent. The clouds thicken fa&s;t:&mdash;where they will bur&s;t, I know not: but we &s;hould be armed at all points.</P>
<P>I have not &s;ucceeded in my applications to the&s;e govern|ments for arms. They have returned for an&s;wer, that they can|not furni&s;h any.&mdash;Whether I &s;hall be more lucky in the la&s;t re|&s;ource left in this quarter, I cannot determine, having not received returns from the officers &s;ent out to purcha&s;e of the peo|ple. I greatly fear that but very few will be procured in this way, as they are exceedingly &s;carce, and but a &s;mall part of what there are, fit for &s;ervice,&mdash;when they make their report you &s;hall be in|formed.</P>
<P>The quarter-ma&s;ter-general has ju&s;t received from general Schuyler clothing for the &s;oldiery, amounting to about &s;even|teen hundred pounds York currency. It has come very &s;ea&s;on|ably, as they are in great want, and will contribute a little to their relief.</P>
<P>Since writing the above, I &s;aw Mr. * * *, and mentioning that nothing had been found in the tree of Conolly's &s;addle, he told me there had been a mi&s;take in the matter; that the in&s;truc|tions were artfully concealed on the two pieces of wood which are on the mail-pillion of his portmanteau-&s;addle; that, by order of lord Dunmore he &s;aw them contrived for the purpo&s;e, the papers put in, and fir&s;t covered with tin, and over that with a waxed canvas cloth.&mdash;He is &s;o exceedingly pointed and clear in his information, that I have no doubt of its being true.&mdash;I could wi&s;h them to be di&s;covered, as I think they contain &s;ome curious and extraordinary plans.</P>
<P>In my letter of the twenty-fourth in&s;tant, I mentioned the arrival of thirteen of our Caghnewaga friends. They honored me with a talk to-day, as did three of the tribes of the St. John's and Pa&s;miquoddi Indians;&mdash;copies of which I beg leave to inclo&s;e you. I &s;hall write to general Schuyler re&s;pecting the tender of &s;ervice made by the former, and not to call for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, unle&s;s he &s;hall at any time want it, or be under the nece&s;&s;ity of doing it to prevent their taking the &s;ide of our ene|mies.</P>
<P>I had the honor of writing to you on the nineteenth of No|vember, and then I informed you of having engaged two per|&s;ons to go to Nova-Scotia on the bu&s;ine&s;s recommended in your letter of the tenth: and al&s;o that the &s;tate of the army would not then admit of a &s;ufficient force being &s;ent, for carrying into execution the views of Congre&s;s re&s;pecting the dock-yards, &amp;c.&mdash;I would now beg leave to mention, that if the per&s;ons,

&s;ent for information, &s;hould report favorably of the expedi|ency and practicability of the mea&s;ure; it will not be in my power to detach any men from the&s;e lines: the &s;ituation of our affairs will not allow it.&mdash;I think it would be advi&s;able to rai&s;e them in the ea&s;tern parts of this government. If it is attempt|ed, it mu&s;t be by people from the country.&mdash;A colonel * * * and a captain * * * have been with me: they think the men nece&s;&s;ary may be ea&s;ily engaged there, and the mea&s;ure practi|cable:&mdash;provided there are not more than two hundred Briti&s;h troops at Halifax, they are willing and ready to embark in the matter, upon the terms mentioned in their plan, which I in|clo&s;e you. I would wi&s;h you to advert to the con&s;iderations inducing them to the expedition, as I am not without appre|hen&s;ion, &s;hould it be undertaken upon their plan, that the in|nocent and guilty will be involved in one common ruin.&mdash;I pre&s;ume they do not expect to receive more than the five or ten thou&s;and pounds mentioned in their &s;cheme, and to be at every expence.&mdash;If we had men to &s;pare, it might be undertaken for le&s;s than either, I conceive.&mdash;Perhaps, if Congre&s;s do not a|dopt their propo&s;ition, they will undertaken to rai&s;e men for that particular purpo&s;e, who may be di&s;banded as &s;oon as it is effected, and upon the &s;ame terms that are allowed the conti|nental troops in general.&mdash;Whatever may be the determination of Congre&s;s upon the &s;ubject, you will plea&s;e to communicate it to me immediately: for the &s;ea&s;on mo&s;t favorable for the en|terpri&s;e, is advancing fa&s;t; and we may expect in the &s;pring that there will be more troops there, and the mea&s;ure be more dif|ficult to execute.</P>

<P>THE purport of this letter will be directed to a &s;ingle ob|ject:&mdash;through you I mean to lay it before Congre&s;s; and&mdash;at the &s;ame time I beg their &s;erious attention to the &s;ubject,&mdash;to a&s;k pardon for intruding an opinion, not only una&s;ked, but, in &s;ome mea&s;ure repugnant to their re&s;olves.</P>
<P>The di&s;advantages attending the limited enli&s;tment of troops are too apparent to tho&s;e who are eye-witne&s;&s;es to them, to ren|der any animadver&s;ions nece&s;&s;ary: but to gentlemen at a di&s;|tance, who&s;e attention is engro&s;&s;ed by a thou&s;and important ob|jects, the ca&s;e may be otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>That this cau&s;e precipitated the fate of the brave and much-to-be-lamented
<PB N="74" REF="031423_0073_0FEC4B09BAF4ED10">
general Montgomery, and brought on the de|feat which followed thereupon, I have not the mo&s;t di&s;tant doubt:&mdash;for, had he not been apprehen&s;ive of the troops leav|ing him at &s;o important a cri&s;is, but continued the blockade at Quebec, a capitulation (from the be&s;t accounts I have been a|ble to collect) mu&s;t inevitably have followed. And that we were not at one time obliged to di&s;pute the&s;e lines under di&s;ad|vantageous circum&s;tances (proceeding from the &s;ame cau&s;e, to wit, the troops di&s;banding of them&s;elves before the militia could be got in), is to me a matter of wonder and a&s;toni&s;hment; and proves that general Howe was either unacquainted with our &s;ituati|on, or re&s;trained by his in&s;tructions from putting any thing to a hazard till his reinforcements &s;hould arrive.</P>
<P>The in&s;tance of general Montgomery&mdash;(I mention it, becau&s;e it is a &s;triking one:&mdash;for a number of others might be adduced)&mdash;proves, that, in&s;tead of having men to take advantage of circum&s;tances, you are in a manner compelled, right or wrong, to make circum&s;tances yield to a &s;econdary con&s;ideration. Since the fir&s;t of December, I have been devi&s;ing every means in my power to &s;ecure the&s;e encampments: and, though I am &s;en&s;ible that we never have, &s;ince that period, been able to act upon the offen&s;ive, and at times not in a condition to defend, yet the co&s;t of marching home one &s;et of men,&mdash;bringing in another,&mdash;the havoc and wa&s;te occa&s;ioned by the fir&s;t,&mdash;the repairs nece&s;&s;a|ry for the &s;econd,&mdash;with a thou&s;and incidental charges and in|conveniences which have ari&s;en, and which it is &s;carcely po&s;&s;i|ble either to recollect or de&s;cribe,&mdash;amount to near as much, as the keeping up a re&s;pectable body of troops the whole time, ready for any emergency would have done.&mdash;To this may be added, that you never can have a well-di&s;ciplined army.</P>
<P>To bring men well acquainted with the duty of a &s;oldier, re|quires time. To bring them under proper di&s;cipline and &s;ubor|dination not only requires time, but is a work of great diffi|culty, and in this army where there is &s;o little di&s;tinction be|tween the officers and &s;oldiers, requires an uncommon degree of attention. To expect then the &s;ame &s;ervice from raw and undi&s;ciplined recruits as from veteran &s;oldiers, is to expect what never did and perhaps never will happen. Men who are familiari&s;ed to danger meet it without &s;hrinking; whereas tho&s;e who have never &s;een &s;ervice often apprehend danger where no danger is. Three things prompt men to a regular di&s;charge of their duty in time of action,&mdash;natural bravery,&mdash;hope of re|ward,&mdash;and fear of puni&s;hment. The two fir&s;t are common to the untutored and the di&s;ciplined &s;oldier: but the latter mo&s;t
<PB N="75" REF="031423_0074_0FEC4B0EF0C7ABC0">
obviou&s;ly di&s;tingui&s;hes the one from the other. A coward, when taught to believe, that, if he breaks his ranks and aban|dons his colors, he will be puni&s;hed with death by his own par|ty,&mdash;will take his chance again&s;t the enemy: but a man who thinks little of the one and is fearful of the other, acts from pre&s;ent feelings, regardle&s;s of con&s;equences.</P>
<P>Again men of a day's &s;tanding will not look forward: and from experience we find, that, as the time appro&aacute;chcs for their di&s;charge they grow carele&s;s of their arms, ammunition, camp uten&s;ils, &amp;c. Nay, even the barracks them&s;elves have felt uncommon marks of wanton depredation, and lay us under fre&s;h trouble and additional expen&s;e in providing for every fre&s;h &s;et, when we find it next to impo&s;&s;ible to procure &s;uch articles as are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in the fir&s;t in&s;tance. To this may be added the &s;ea&s;oning which new recruits mu&s;t have to a camp, and the lo&s;s con&s;equent thereupon. But this is not all&mdash;Men, engaged for a &s;hort limited time only, have the officers too much in their power: for, to obtain a degree of popularity in order to induce a &s;econd enli&s;tment, a kind of familiarity takes place, which brings on a relaxation of di&s;cipline, unlicenced furloughs, and other indulgences incompatible with order and good government; by which means, the latter part of the time for which the &s;oldier was engaged, is &s;pent in undoing what you were aiming to inculcate in the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>To go into an enumeration of all the evils we have experi|enced in this late great change of the army, and the expences incidental to it,&mdash;to &s;ay nothing of the hazard we have run, and mu&s;t run, between the di&s;charging of one army and enli&s;t|ment of another, unle&s;s an enormous expen&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> militia is in|curred,&mdash;would greatly exceed the bounds of a letter. What I have already taken the liberty of &s;aying will &s;erve to convey a general idea of the matter: and therefore I &s;hall, with all due deference, take the freedom to give it as my opinion, that, if the Congre&s;s have any rea&s;on to believe that there will be occa&s;ion for troops another year, and con&s;equently of another enli&s;tment, they would &s;ave money, and have infinitely better troops, if they were, even at a bounty of twenty, thirty, or more dollars, to engage the men already enli&s;ted (till January next), and &s;uch others as may be wanted to complete the en|li&s;tment, for and during the war. I will not undertake to &s;ay that the men can be had upon the&s;e terms; but I am &s;atisfied that it will never do, to let the matter alone, as it was la&s;t year, till the time of &s;ervice was nearly expiring. The hazard is too great in the fir&s;t place:&mdash;in the next, the trouble and

perplexity of di&s;banding one army and rai&s;ing of another at the &s;ame in&s;tant, and in &s;uch a critical &s;ituation as the la&s;t was, is &s;carcely in the power of words to de&s;cribe, and &s;uch as no man, who has experienced it once, will ever undergo again.</P>
<P>If Congre&s;s &s;hould differ from me in &s;entiments upon this point, I have only to beg that they will do me the ju&s;tice to believe, that I have nothing more in view than what to me ap|pears nece&s;&s;ary to advance the public weal, although in the fir&s;t in&s;tance it will be attended with a capital expence;&mdash;and that I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN compliance with the re&s;olves of Congre&s;s, I have ap|plied to general Howe for the exchange of Mr. Lovell. A copy of my letter, and his an&s;wer thereto, you have inclo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Captain Watters and captain Tucker, who command two of the armed &s;chooners, have taken and &s;ent into Gloce&s;ter a large brigantine, laden with wood, a hundred and fifty butts for wa|ter, and forty &s;uits of bedding bound from La Have in Nova|Scotia, for Bo&s;ton. She is one of the tran&s;ports in the mini|&s;terial &s;ervice. The captain &s;ays that he was at Halifax, the &s;e|venteenth of January, and that general Ma&s;&s;y was arrived there with two regiments from Ireland.</P>
<P>The different prizes were all libelled immediately on the re|ceipt of the re&s;olves of Congre&s;s pointing out the mode; but none of them yet brought to trial, owing to a difference be|tween the law pa&s;&s;ed in this province, and the re&s;olutions of Congre&s;s. The general court are making an amendment to their law, by which the difficulties that now occur will be re|moved, as I under&s;tand it is to be made conformable to your re&s;olves. The unavoidable delay attending the bringing the captors to trial is grievou&s;ly complained of by the ma&s;ters of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, as well as the captors. Many of the former have ap|plied for liberty to go away without waiting the deci&s;ion,&mdash;which I have granted them.</P>
<P>I beg leave to recall the attention of Congre&s;s to their ap|pointing a commi&s;&s;ary in the&s;e parts, to attend the providing of nece&s;&s;aries for the pri&s;oners who are di&s;per&s;ed in the&s;e pro|vinces. Complaints are made by &s;ome of them, that they are in want of bedding and many other things. As I under&s;tand that Mr. Franks has undertaken that bu&s;ine&s;s, I wi&s;h he was ordered to &s;end a deputy immediately to &s;ee that the pri&s;oners
<PB N="77" REF="031423_0076_0FEC4B10A24C3A48">
get what is allowed them by Congre&s;s; al&s;o to &s;upply the offi|cers with money as they may have occa&s;ion. It would &s;ave me much time and much trouble.</P>
<P>There are yet but few companies of the militia come in. This delay will, I am much afraid, fru&s;trate the intention of their being called upon, as the &s;ea&s;on is &s;lipping fa&s;t away when they may be of &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The demands of the army were &s;o very pre&s;&s;ing before your la&s;t remittance came to hand, that I was under the nece&s;&s;ity of borrowing twenty-five thou&s;and pounds, lawful money from this province. They very cheerfully lent it, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> pa&s;&s;ed a vote for as much more, if required. I have not repaid the &s;um bor|rowed, as I may &s;tand in need of it before the arrival of an|other &s;upply, which the demands of the commi&s;&s;ary-general quarterma&s;ter-general, and paying off the arrearages will very &s;oon require.</P>
<P>Your e&s;teemed favor of the twenty-ninth ultimo is ju&s;t come to hand. It makes me very happy to find my conduct hath met the approbation of Congre&s;s. I am entirely of your opi|nion, that, &s;hould an accommodation take place, the terms will be &s;evere or favorable in proportion to our ability to re&s;i&s;t, and that we ought to be on a re&s;pectable footing to receive their armaments in the &s;pring. But how far we &s;hall be pro|vided with the means, is a matter I profe&s;s not to know, under my pre&s;ent unhappy want of arms, ammunition, and, I may add, men,&mdash;as our regiments are very incomplete. The re|cruiting goes on very &s;low, and will, I apprehend, be more &s;o, if for other &s;ervice the men receive a bounty, and none is given here.</P>
<P>I have tried every method I could think of, to procure arms for our men. They really are not to be had in the&s;e govern|ments (belonging to the public); and if &s;ome method is not fallen upon, in the &s;outhern governments, to &s;upply us, we &s;hall be in a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation for want of them. There are near two thou&s;and men now in camp without firelocks.&mdash;I have wrote to the committee of New-York this day, reque&s;ting them to &s;end me tho&s;e arms which were taken from the di&s;affected in that government. The Congre&s;s intere&s;ting them&s;elves in this reque&s;t will doubtle&s;s have a good effect. I have &s;ent officers into the country, with money to purcha&s;e arms in the different towns. Some have returned, and brought in a few:&mdash;many are &s;till out:&mdash;what their &s;ucce&s;s will be, I cannot determine.</P>
<P>I was in great hopes that the expre&s;&s;es, re&s;olved to be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed between this place and Philadelphia, would ere now
<PB N="78" REF="031423_0077_0FEC4B14433F0630">
have been fixed. It would, in my opinion, rather &s;ave than increa&s;e the expen&s;e; as many hor&s;es are de&s;troyed by one man coming the whole way. It will certainly be more expeditious, and &s;afer, than writing by the po&s;t or private hands, which I am often under the nece&s;&s;ity of doing.</P>

<P>THROUGH you, I beg leave to lay before Congre&s;s the inclo&s;ed letter from Lord Drummond to general Robert&s;on, which came to my hands a few days ago, in order to be &s;ent into Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>As I never heard of his lord&s;hip being ve&s;ted with power to treat with Congre&s;s upon the &s;ubject of our grievances, nor of his having laid any propo&s;itions before them for an accommo|dation, I confe&s;s it &s;urpri&s;ed much, and led me to form va|rious conjectures of his motives, and intended application to general Howe and admiral Shuldham for a pa&s;&s;port, for the &s;afe-conduct of &s;uch deputies as Congre&s;s might appoint for ne|gociating terms of reconciliation between Great-Britain and us.&mdash;Whatever his intentions are, however benevolent his de&s;igns

I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, that, if the mode for negociation, which he points out, &s;hould be adopted (which I hope will never be thought of), it ought to have been fixed and &s;ettled previous to any application of this &s;ort; and at be&s;t, that his conduct in this in&s;tance is premature and officious, and leading to con&s;equences of a fatal and injurious nature to the rights of this country. His zeal and de&s;ire, perhaps, of an a|micable and con&s;titutional adju&s;tment's taking place may have &s;ugge&s;ted and precipitated the mea&s;ure. Be that as it may, I thought it of too much importance, to &s;uffer it to go in without having the expre&s;s direction of Congre&s;s for that purpo&s;e&punc; and that it was my indi&s;pen&s;able duty to tran&s;mit them the ori|ginal, to make &s;uch interpretations and inferences as they may think right.</P>
<P>Me&s;&s;rs. Willard and Child, who were &s;ent to Nova-Scotia in pur&s;uance of the re&s;olve of Congre&s;s, have ju&s;t returned, and made their report, which I do my&s;elf the honor to enclo&s;e you. They have not an&s;wered the purpo&s;es of their commi&s;&s;ion by a|ny means, as they only went a little way into that country, and found their intelligence upon the information of others. You will &s;ee the rea&s;ons they a&s;&s;ign in excu&s;e or ju&s;tification of their conduct, in the report it&s;elf.</P>
<P>La&s;t night a party of regulars, &s;aid to be about five hundred, landed on Dorche&s;ter neck, and burned &s;ome of the hou&s;es there, which were of no value to us; nor would they have been, unle&s;s we take po&s;t there; they then might be of &s;ome &s;ervice. A detachment went after them as &s;oon as the fire was di&s;cover|ed: but, before it could arrive, they had executed their plan, and made their retreat.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed is a letter for David Franks, e&s;quire, from Mr. Chamier in Bo&s;ton, upon the &s;ubject of victualling &s;uch of the king's troops as may be pri&s;oners within the limits of his con|tract, which I beg the favor of you to deliver him, and that proper agents may be appointed by him, to &s;ee that it is done. I could wi&s;h too, that Congre&s;s would fall upon &s;ome mode for &s;upplying the officers with &s;uch money as they may really &s;tand in need of, and depute proper per&s;ons for that purpo&s;e, and furni&s;hing the privates with &s;uch cloathing as may be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.

<P>THE late freezing weather having formed &s;ome pretty &s;trong ice from Dorche&s;ter point to Bo&s;ton neck, and from Roxbury to the Common, thereby affording a more expanded and con&s;equently a le&s;s dangerous approach to the town, I could not help thinking,&mdash;notwith&s;tanding the militia were not all come in, and we had little or no powder to begin our operation by a regular cannonade or bombardment,&mdash;that a bold and re|&s;olute a&s;&s;ault upon the troops in Bo&s;ton with &s;uch men as we had (for it could not take many men to guard our own lines at a time when the enemy were attacked in all quarters) might be crowned with &s;ucce&s;s: and therefore, &s;eeing no certain pro&s;pect of a &s;upply of powder on the one hand, and a certain di&s;&s;olution of the ice on the other, I called the general officers together, for their opinion, agreeably to the re&s;olve of Congre&s;s, of the twenty-&s;econd of December.</P>
<P>The re&s;ult will appear in the enclo&s;ed council of war; and, being almo&s;t unanimous, I mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e it to be right; al|though, from a thorough conviction of the nece&s;&s;ity of attempt|ing &s;omething again&s;t the mini&s;terial troops before a reinforce|ment &s;hould arrive, and while we were favored with the ice, I was not only ready, but willing, and de&s;irous of making the a&s;|&s;ault, under a firm hope (if the men would have &s;tood by me) of a favorable i&s;&s;ue, notwith&s;tanding the enemy's advantage of ground, artillery, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Perhaps the irk&s;omene&s;s of my &s;ituation may have given dif|ferent ideas to me, than tho&s;e which influenced the gentlemen I con&s;ulted, and might have inclined me to put more to the hazard, than was con&s;i&s;tent with prudence:&mdash;If it had, I am not &s;en&s;ible of it, as I endeavored to give it all the con&s;idera|tion that a matter of &s;uch importance required.

of &s;ome great event,&mdash;and to be re&s;trained in every military operation, for want of the nece&s;&s;ary means of carrying it on,&mdash;is not very plea&s;ing, e&s;pecially as the means u&s;ed to conceal my weakne&s;s from the enemy, conceal it al&s;o from our friends, and add to their wonder.</P>
<P>I do not utter this by way of complaint. I am &s;en&s;ible that all that the Congre&s;s could do, they have done; and I &s;hould feel mo&s;t powerfully the weight of con&s;cious ingratitude, were I not to acknowledge this. But as we have accounts of the arri|val of powder in captain Ma&s;on, I would beg to have it &s;ent on in the mo&s;t expeditious manner: otherwi&s;e we not only lo&s;e all chance of the benefits re&s;ulting from the &s;ea&s;on, but of the militia, who are brought in at a mo&s;t enormous expence, upon a pre|&s;umption that we &s;hould, long ere this, have been amply &s;upplied with powder, under the contracts entered into with the committee of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>The militia, contrary to an expre&s;s requi&s;ition, are come and coming in without ammunition. To &s;upply them alone with twenty-four rounds (which is le&s;s by three fifths, than the regu|lars are &s;erved with) will take between fifty and &s;ixty barrels of powder; and to complete the other troops to the like quantity, will take near as much more, and leave in &s;tore not more than about &s;ixty barrels, be&s;ides a few rounds of cannon cartridges ready filled for u&s;e. This, &s;ir, Congre&s;s may be a&s;&s;ured, is a true &s;tate of our powder, and will I hope bear &s;ome te&s;timo|ny of my incapacity for action in &s;uch a way as may do any e&s;|&s;ential &s;ervice.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD the honor of addre&s;&s;ing you on the eighteenth and twenty-fir&s;t in&s;tant, by Mr. Hooper; &s;ince which, nothing ma|terial has occurred.</P>
<P>We are making every nece&s;&s;ary preparation for taking po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of Dorche&s;ter heights as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, with a view of drawing the enemy out. How far our expectations may be an|&s;wered, time only can determine: but I &s;hould think, if any thing would induce them to hazard an engagement, it will be our attempting to fortify the&s;e heights; as on that event's taking place, we &s;hall be able to command a great part of the town, and almo&s;t the whole harbor, and to make them rather di&s;agreea|ble than otherwi&s;e, provided we can get a &s;ufficient &s;upply of what we greatly want.</P>
<P>Within the&s;e three or four days, I have received &s;undry ac|counts from Bo&s;ton, of &s;uch movements there&mdash;(&s;uch as taking the mortars, from Bunker's hill,&mdash;the putting them, with &s;eve|ral pieces of heavy ordnance, on board of &s;hip, with a quantity of bedding,&mdash;the &s;hips all taking in water,&mdash;the baking a large quantity of bi&s;cuit, &amp;c.)&mdash;as to indicate an embarkation of the troops from thence. A Mr. Ides, who came out ye&s;terday, &s;ays that the inhabitants of the town generally believe that they are about to remove either to New-York or Virginia, and that every ve&s;&s;el in the harbor, on Tue&s;day la&s;t, was taken up for government's &s;ervice, and two months' pay advanced them.&mdash;Whether they really intend to embark, or whether the whole is a feint, is impo&s;&s;ible for me to tell. However I have thought it expedient to &s;end an expre&s;s to general Lee, to inform him of it&mdash;(in order that he may not be taken by &s;urpri&s;e, if their de&s;tination &s;hould be again&s;t New-York,)&mdash;and continued him on to you. If they do embark, I think the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them|&s;elves of that place, and of the North river, is the object they have in view, thereby &s;ecuring the communication with Canada, and rendering the intercour&s;e between the northern and &s;outhern United Colonies exceedingly precarious and dif|ficult. To prevent them from effecting their plan, is a mat|ter of the highe&s;t importance, and will require a large and re&s;pectable army, and the mo&s;t vigilant and judicious exer|tions.</P>
<P>Since I wrote by Mr. Hooper, &s;ome &s;mall parcels of pow|der have arrived from Connecticut, which will give us a little a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>On thur&s;day night a party of our men at Roxbury made the

enemy's out-centuries, con&s;i&s;ting of a corporal and two privates, pri&s;oners, without firing a gun or giving the lea&s;t alarm.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be as attentive to the enemy's motions as I can, and obtain all the intelligence in my power; and, if I find them embark, &s;hall in the mo&s;t expeditious manner detach a part of the light troops to New-York, and repair thither my&s;elf if cir|cum&s;tances &s;hall require it. I &s;hall be better able to judge what to do, when the matter happens. At pre&s;ent, I can on|ly &s;ay, that I will do every thing that &s;hall appear proper and nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Your letter of the twelfth in&s;tant, by colonel Bull, came to hand ye&s;terday evening: and I &s;hall agreeable to your recommen|dation, pay proper notice to him.&mdash;The &s;upply of ca&s;h came very &s;ea&s;onably, as our trea&s;ury was ju&s;t exhau&s;ted, and nothing can be done here without it.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON the twenty-&s;ixth ultimo I had the honor of addre&s;&s;ing you, and then mentioned that we were making preparations for taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Dorche&s;ter heights.&mdash;I now beg leave to in|form you, that a council of general officers having determined a previous bombardment and cannonade expedient and proper, in order to harra&s;s the enemy and divert their attention from that quarter,&mdash;on &s;aturday, &s;unday and monday nights la&s;t, we carried them on from our po&s;ts at Coble-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ill, Leechmore's point, and Lam's-dam. Whether they did the enemy any con|&s;iderable and what injury, I have not yet heard, but have the plea&s;ure to acquaint you that they greatly facilitated our &s;chemes, and would have been attended with &s;ucce&s;s equal to our mo&s;t &s;an|guine expectations, had it not been for the unlucky bur&s;ting of two thirteen, and three ten-inch mortars, among which was the bra&s;s one taken in the ordnance brig. To what cau&s;e to attri|bute this misfortune, I know not,&mdash;whether to any defect in them, or to the inexperience of the bombardiers. But to re|turn,&mdash;on monday evening, as &s;oon as our firing commenced, a con&s;iderable detachment of our men, under the command of brigadier-general Thomas, cro&s;&s;ed the neck, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the two hills, without the lea&s;t interruption or annoyance
<PB N="84" REF="031423_0083_0FEC4B247ABD3F28">
from the enemy; and by their great activity and indu&s;try, before the morning, advanced the works &s;o far as to be &s;ecure again&s;t their &s;hot. They are now going on with &s;uch expedition, that in a little time I hope they will be complete, and enable our troops &s;tationed there to make a vigorous and ob&s;tinate &s;tand.&mdash;During the whole cannonade, which was ince&s;&s;ant the la&s;t two nights, we were fortunate enough to lo&s;e but two men,&mdash;one, a lieutenant, by a cannon ball's taking off his thigh,&mdash;the other, a private, by the explo&s;ion of a &s;hell, which al&s;o &s;lightly wounded four or five more.</P>
<P>Our taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Dorche&s;ter heights is only preparatory to taking po&s;t on Nuke-hill, and the points oppo&s;ite the &s;outh end of Bo&s;ton. It was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould be previou&s;ly fortified, in order to cover and command them.&mdash;As &s;oon as the works on the former are fini&s;hed and complete, mea&s;ures will be immediately adopted for &s;ecuring the latter, and making them as &s;trong and defen&s;ible as we can. Their con|tiguity to the enemy will make them of much importance, and of great &s;ervice to us.</P>
<P>As mortars are e&s;&s;ential, and indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary for carry|ing on our operations, and for the pro&s;ecution of our plans, I have applied to two furnaces to have &s;ome thirteen inch ones ca&s;t with all expedition imaginable, and am encouraged to hope, from the accounts I have had, that they will be able to do it. When they are done, and a proper &s;upply of powder obtained, I flatter my&s;elf, from the po&s;ts we have ju&s;t taken and are about to take, that it will be in our power to force the mini&s;terial troops to an attack, or to di&s;po&s;e of them in &s;ome way that will be of advantage to us. I think from the&s;e po&s;ts they will be &s;o galled and annoyed, that they mu&s;t either give us battle or quit their pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. I am re&s;olved that nothing on my part &s;hall be wanting, to effect the one or the other.</P>
<P>It having been the general opinion that the enemy would at|tempt to di&s;lodge our people from the hills, and force their works as &s;oon as they were di&s;covered, which probably might have brought on a general engagement,&mdash;it was thought ad|vi&s;able that the honorable council &s;hould be applied to, to order in the militia from the neighboring and adjacent towns. I wrote to them on the &s;ubject, which they mo&s;t readily complied with: and in ju&s;tice to the militia, I cannot but inform you that they came in at the appointed time, and manife&s;ted the greate&s;t alertne&s;s and determined re&s;olution to have acted like men engaged in the cau&s;e of freedom.</P>
<P>When the enemy fir&s;t di&s;covered our works in the morning,
<PB N="85" REF="031423_0084_0FEC4B2FB52F95D8">
they &s;eemed to be in great confu&s;ion, and, from their move|ments, to have intended an attack. It is much to be wi&s;hed that it had been made: the event, I think, mu&s;t have been fortunate, and nothing le&s;s than &s;ucce&s;s and victory on our &s;ide, as our officers and men appeared impatient for the appeal, and to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t animated &s;entiments and determined re|&s;olution.</P>
<P>On tue&s;day evening a con&s;iderable number of their troops, embarked on board of their tran&s;ports, and fell down to the ca&s;tle, where part of them landed before dark. One or two of the ve&s;&s;els got a-ground, and were fired at by our people with a field-piece, but without any damage.&mdash;What was the de&s;ign of this embarkation and landing, I have not been able to learn. It would &s;eem as if they meant an attack; for it is mo&s;t proba|ble, that, if they make one on our works at Dorche&s;ter at this time, they will fir&s;t go to the ca&s;tle, and come from thence. If &s;uch was their de&s;ign, a violent &s;torm that night, and which la&s;ted till eight o'clock the next day, rendered the execution of it impracticable. It carried one or two of their ve&s;&s;els on &s;hore, which have &s;ince got off.</P>
<P>In ca&s;e the mini&s;terial troops had made an attempt to di&s;lodge our men from Dorche&s;ter hills, and the number detached upon the occa&s;ion had been &s;o great as to have afforded a probability of a &s;ucce&s;sful attack's being made upon Bo&s;ton,&mdash;on a &s;ignal given from Roxbury, for that purpo&s;e, agreeable to a &s;ettled and con|certed plan, four thou&s;and cho&s;en men, who were held in rea|dine&s;s, were to have embarked at the mouth of Cambridge river, in two divi&s;ions, the fir&s;t under the command of briga|dier-general Sullivan, the &s;econd under brigadier-general Greene,&mdash;the whole to have been commanded by major-general Put|nam. The fir&s;t divi&s;ion was to land at the powder-hou&s;e, and gain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Bacon-Hill and Mount-Horam,&mdash;the &s;econd at Barton's point or a little &s;outh of it, and, after &s;ecuring that po&s;t, to join the other divi&s;ion, and force the enemy's gates and works at the neck, for letting in the Roxbury troops. Three floating bat|teries were to have preceded, and gone in front of the other boats, and kept up a heavy fire on that part of the town where our men were to land.</P>
<P>How far our views would have &s;ucceeded, had an opportuni|ty offered for attempting the execution, is impo&s;&s;ible for me to &s;ay: nothing le&s;s than experiment could determine with pre|ci&s;ion. The plan was thought to be well dige&s;ted; and, as far as I could judge from the cheerfulne&s;s and alacrity which di&s;|tingui&s;hed
<PB N="86" REF="031423_0085_0FEC4B34562D3348">
the officers and men who were to engage in the enter|pri&s;e, I had rea&s;on to hope for a favorable and happy i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>The militia who were ordered in from the adjacent towns bro't with them three day's provi&s;ion. They were only called upon to act under the idea of an attack's being immediately made, and were all di&s;charged this afternoon.</P>
<P>I beg leave to remind Congre&s;s that three major-generals are e&s;&s;ential and nece&s;&s;ary for this army; and that, by general Lee's being called from hence to the command in Canada, the left divi&s;ion is without one. I hope they will fill up the vacancy by the appointment of another. General Thomas is the fir&s;t brigadier, &s;tands fair in the point of reputation, and is e&s;teemed a brave and good officer. If he is promoted, there will be a vacancy in the brigadier-generals, which it will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upply by the appointment of &s;ome other gentleman that &s;hall be agreeable to Congre&s;s: But ju&s;tice requires me to mention that William Thomp&s;on, e&s;quire, of the rifle regiment, is the fir&s;t co|lonel in this department, and, as far as I have had an opportunity of judging, is a good officer and a man of courage. What I have &s;aid of the&s;e two gentlemen, I conceived to be my duty, at the &s;ame time acknowledging, whatever promotions are made will be &s;atisfactory to me.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 9.&mdash;Ye&s;terday evening, a captain Irvine, who e&s;|caped from Bo&s;ton the night before, whith &s;ix of his crew, came to head-quarters, and gave the following intelligence:&mdash;"That our bombardment and cannonade cau&s;ed a great deal of &s;urpri&s;e and alarm in town, as many of the &s;oldiery &s;aid they never heard or thought we had mortars or &s;hells;&mdash;that &s;everal of the officers acknowledged they were well and properly directed;&mdash;that they made much di&s;tre&s;s and confu&s;ion:&mdash;that the cannon|&s;hot, for the greate&s;t part, went through the hou&s;es; and he was told that one took off the legs and arms of &s;ix men lying in the barracks on the neck;&mdash;that a &s;oldier, who came from the lines, there on tue&s;day morning informed him that twenty men had been wounded the night before; it was reported that others were al&s;o hurt, and one of the light hor&s;e torn to pieces by the explo&s;ion of a &s;hell: (this was afterwards contradicted:)&mdash;that, early on tue&s;day morning, admiral Shuldham, di&s;co|vering the works our people were throwing up on Dorche&s;ter heights, immediately &s;ent an expre&s;s to general Howe, to inform him that it was nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould be attacked and di&s;|lodged from thence, or he would be under the nece&s;&s;ity of with|drawing the &s;hips from the harbor, which were under his com|mand;&mdash;that preparations were directly made for that purpo&s;e,
<PB N="87" REF="031423_0086_0FEC4B3665659008">
as it was &s;aid; and, from twelve to two o'clock, about three thou&s;and men embarked on board the tran&s;ports, which fell down to the ca&s;tle with a de&s;ign of landing on that part of Dor|che&s;ter next to it, and attacking our works on the heights at five o'clock the next morning;&mdash;that lord Percy was appointed to command;&mdash;that it was generally believed the attempt would have been made, had it not been for the violent &s;torm which happened that night, as I have mentioned before;&mdash;that he heard &s;everal of the privates, and one or two &s;erjeants, &s;ay as they were embarking, "that it would be another Bunker's-hill affair."</P>
<P>He further informs&mdash;"that the army is preparing to leave Bo&s;ton, and that they will do it in a day or two;&mdash;that the tran&s;ports nece&s;&s;ary for their embarkation were getting ready with the utmo&s;t expedition;&mdash;that there had been great move|ments and confu&s;ion among the troops, the night and day pre|ceding his coming out, in hurrying down their cannon, artil|lery and other &s;tores, to the wharfs, with the utmo&s;t precipita|tion, and they were putting them on board the &s;hips in &s;uch ha&s;te, that no account or memorandum was taken of them;&mdash;that mo&s;t of the cannon were removed from their works, and embarked or embarking;&mdash;that he heard a woman &s;ay, whom he took to be an officer's wife, that &s;he had &s;een men go under the ground at the lines on the neck, without returning;&mdash;that the &s;hip he commanded was taken up, places fitted, and fitting for officers to lodge, and &s;everal &s;hot, &s;hells and cannon alrea|dy on board; that the tories were to have the liberty of going where they plea&s;e, if they can get &s;eamen to man the ve&s;&s;els, of whom there was a great &s;carcity;&mdash;that, on that account, many ve&s;&s;els could not be carried away, and would be burned;&mdash;that many of the inhabitants apprehended the town would be de|&s;troyed; and that it was generally thought their de&s;tination is Halifax."</P>
<P>The account given by captain Irvine, as to the embarkation, and their being about to leave the town, I believe true. There are other circum&s;tances corroborating; and it &s;eems fully con|firmed by a paper &s;igned by four of the &s;electmen of the town, (a copy of which I have the honor to enclo&s;e you,) which was brought out ye&s;terday evening by a flag, and delivered to colo|nel Learned, by major Ba&s;&s;et of the tenth regiment, who de|&s;ired it might be delivered me as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. I advi&s;ed with &s;uch of the general officers upon the occa&s;ion, as I could immediately a&s;&s;emble; and we determined it right (as it was not addre&s;&s;ed to me or any one el&s;e, nor authenticated by the &s;ig|nature
<PB N="88" REF="031423_0087_0FEC4B3A0F8C6860">
nature of general Howe, or any other act obliging him to a per|formance of the promi&s;e mentioned on his part) that I &s;hould give it no an&s;wer; at the &s;ame time, that a letter &s;hould be returned, as going from colonel Learned, &s;ignifying his having laid it before me,&mdash;with the rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned for not an&s;wering it.&mdash;A copy of this is &s;ent.</P>
<P>To-night I &s;hall have a battery thrown up on Nuke-hill (Dorche&s;ter point) with a de&s;ign of acting as circum&s;tances may require; it being judged advi&s;able to pro&s;ecute our plans of fortifi|cation as we intended, before this information from the &s;electmen came.</P>
<P>It being agreed on all hands that there is no po&s;&s;ibility of &s;topping them in ca&s;e they determine to go,&mdash;I &s;hall order look-outs to be kept upon all the head-lands, to di&s;cover their movements and cour&s;e, and moreover direct commodore Manly and his little &s;quadron to dog them, as well for the &s;ame pur|po&s;e as for picking up any of their ve&s;&s;els that may chance to depart their convoy. From their loading with &s;uch precipi|tancy, it is pre&s;umable they will not be in the be&s;t condition for &s;ea.</P>
<P>If the mini&s;terial troops evacuate the town and leave it &s;tanding, I have thoughts of taking mea&s;ures for fortifying the entrance into the harbor, if it &s;hall be thought proper, and the &s;ituation of af|fairs will admit of it.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the report from Bo&s;ton that Halifax is the place of their de&s;tination, I have no doubt but they are going to the &s;outhward of this,&mdash;and, I apprehend, to New-York. Many rea&s;ons lead to this opinion: it is in &s;ome mea&s;ure corroborated by their &s;ending an expre&s;s &s;hip there, which, on wedne&s;day week, got on &s;hore and bilged at Cape-Cod. The di&s;patches, if written, were de&s;troyed when &s;he was boarded. She had a parcel of coal, and about four thou&s;and cannon &s;hot, &s;ix carriage-guns, a &s;wivel or two, and three barrels of powder.</P>
<P>I &s;hall hold the riflemen and other parts of our troops in readi|ne&s;s to march at a moment's warning, and govern my movements by the events that happen, or &s;uch orders as I may receive from Congre&s;s, which I beg may be ample, and forwarded with all po&s;|&s;ible expedition.</P>
<P>On the &s;ixth in&s;tant, a &s;hip bound from London, with &s;tores for the mini&s;terial army, con&s;i&s;ting of coal, porter, and krout, fell in with our armed ve&s;&s;els, four of them in company, and was carried into Port&s;mouth. She had had a long pa&s;&s;age, and of cour&s;e brought no papers of late date. The only letters of
<PB N="89" REF="031423_0088_0FEC4B3C05D5BA88">
importance, or in the lea&s;t intere&s;ting, that were found, I have inclo&s;ed.</P>
<P>I beg leave to mention to Congre&s;s that money is much wanted. The militia from the&s;e governments, engaged till the fir&s;t of April, are then to be paid: and, if we march from hence, the expen&s;e will be very con&s;iderable, mu&s;t be defrayed, and cannot be accompli&s;hed without it. The nece&s;&s;ity of making the earlie&s;t remittance for the&s;e purpo&s;es is too obvious, for me to add more.</P>
<P>When I wrote that part of this letter which is antecedent to this date, I fully expected it would have gone before now by colonel Bull, not deeming it of &s;ufficient importance to &s;end a &s;pecial me&s;&s;enger. But he deferred his return from time to time, and never &s;et off till to-day. The&s;e rea&s;ons I hope will excu&s;e the delay, and be received as a proper apology for not tran&s;mitting it &s;ooner.</P>

<P>IN my letter of the &s;eventh and ninth in&s;tant which I had the honor of addre&s;&s;ing you, I mentioned the intelli|gence I had received re&s;pecting the embarkation of the troop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> from Bo&s;ton; and fully expected, before this, that the town would have been entirely evacuated. Although I have been deceived, and was rather premature in the opinion I had then formed, I have little rea&s;on to doubt but the event will take place in a very &s;hort time, as other accounts which have come to hand &s;ince, of the &s;ailing of a great number of tran&s;ports from the harbor of Nanta&s;ket road, and many circum&s;tances corre&s;ponding therewith, &s;eem to confirm and render it unque&s;|tionable.</P>

<P>Holding it of the la&s;t importance in the pre&s;ent conte&s;t that we &s;hould &s;ecure New-York, and prevent the enemy from po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing it,&mdash;and conjecturing they have views of that &s;ort, and their embarkation to be for that purpo&s;e,&mdash;I judged it nece&s;&s;a|ry, under the &s;ituation of things here, to call a council of gene|ral
<PB N="90" REF="031423_0089_0FEC4B3E2A8018B0">
officers to con&s;ult of &s;uch mea&s;ures as might be expedient to be taken at this intere&s;ting conjuncture of affairs. A copy of the pro|ceedings I have the honor to enclo&s;e you.</P>
<P>Agreeable to the opinion of the council, I &s;hall detach the rifle regiment to-morrow, under the command of brigadier-ge|neral Sullivan, with orders to repair to New-York with all po&s;&s;ible expedition; which will be &s;ucceeded, the day after, by the other five in one brigade,&mdash;they being all that it was thought advi&s;able to &s;end from hence till the enemy &s;hall have quitted the town. Immediately upon their departure, I &s;hall &s;end forward major-general Putnam, and follow my&s;elf with the remainder of the army as &s;oon as I have it in my power,&mdash;leaving here &s;uch a number of men as circum&s;tances may &s;eem to require.</P>
<P>As the badne&s;s of the roads at this &s;ea&s;on will greatly retard the march of our men, I have, by advice of the general officers, wrote to governor Trumbull by this expre&s;s, to u&s;e his utmo&s;t ex|ertions for throwing a reinforcement of two thou&s;and men into New-York, from the we&s;tern parts of Connecticut,&mdash;and to the commanding officer there, to apply to the provincial convention or committee of &s;afety of New-Jer&s;ey, for a thou&s;and more for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, to oppo&s;e the enemy and prevent their getting po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, in ca&s;e they arrive before the troops from hence can get there; of which there is a probability, unle&s;s they are impeded by contrary winds. This mea&s;ure, though it may be attended with con&s;iderable expen&s;e, I flatter my&s;elf, will meet with the appro|bation of Congre&s;s.&mdash;Pa&s;t experience, and the lines in Bo&s;ton and on Bo&s;ton neck, point out the propriety, and &s;ugge&s;t the nece&s;&s;ity of keeping our enemies from gaining po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and making a lodg|ment.</P>
<P>Should their de&s;tination be further &s;outhward, or for Hali|fax (as reported in Bo&s;ton) for the purpo&s;e of going into Cana|da,&mdash;the march of our troops to New-York will place them nearer the &s;cene of action, and more convenient for affording &s;uc|cours.</P>
<P>We have not taken po&s;t on Nuke-hill, and fortified it, as mentioned that we &s;hould, in my la&s;t. On hearing that the ene|my were about to retreat and leave the town, it was thought imprudent and unadvi&s;able to force them with two much preci|pitation, that we might gain a little time, and prepare for a march. To-morrow evening we &s;hall take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, unle&s;s they are gone.</P>
<P>As New-York is of &s;uch importance,&mdash;prudence and policy require that every precaution that can be devi&s;ed &s;hould be
<PB N="91" REF="031423_0090_0FEC4B4000711920">
adopted, to fru&s;trate the de&s;igns which the enemy have of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ing it. To this end I have ordered ve&s;&s;els to be provided and held ready at Norwich, for the embarkation and tran&s;porta|tion of our troops thither. This I have done with a view not on|ly of greatly expediting their arrival (as it will &s;ave &s;everal day's marching,) but al&s;o that they may be fre&s;h and fit for intrench|ing and throwing up works of defence as &s;oon as they get there, if they do not meet the enemy to contend with;&mdash;for neither of which would they be in a proper condition after a long and fatiguing march in bad roads. If Wallace, with his &s;hips, &s;hould be appri&s;ed of the mea&s;ure, and attempt to prevent it by &s;topping up the harbour of New-London, they can but pur&s;ue their march by land.</P>
<P>You will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve that it is the opinion of the general officers, if the enemy abandon the town, that it will be unne|ce&s;&s;ary to employ or keep any part of this army for its defence; and that I have mentioned, on that event's happening, I &s;hall immediately repair to New-York with the remainder of the army not now detached, leaving only &s;uch a number of men here as circum&s;tances may &s;eem to require. What I partly allude to, is, that, as it will take a con&s;iderable time for the removal of &s;uch a body of men, and the divi&s;ions mu&s;t precede each other in &s;uch order as to allow intermediate time &s;ufficient for them to be covered and provided for, and many things done pre|vious to the march of the whole, for &s;ecuring and forward|ing &s;uch nece&s;&s;aries as cannot be immediately carried, and others which may be proper to keep here,&mdash;that directions might be received from Congre&s;s re&s;pecting the &s;ame, and as many men ordered to remain for that and other purpo&s;es, as they may judge proper. I could wi&s;h to have their commands upon the &s;ubject, and in time; as I may be under &s;ome degree of embarra&s;&s;ment as to their views.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s having been plea&s;ed to appoint colonel Thomp&s;on a brigadier-general, there is a vacancy for a colonel in the regi|ment he commanded, to which I would beg leave to recommend the lieutenant-colonel Hand. I &s;hall al&s;o take the liberty of recommending captain Hugh Stephen&s;on, of the Virginia, rifle|men, to &s;ucceed colonel Hand, and to be appointed in his place as a lieutenant colonel,&mdash;there being no major to the re|giment &s;ince the promotion of major Magraw to be lieutenant-colonel of one of the Penn&s;ylvania battalions, and who is gone from hence. He is, in my opinion, the fitte&s;t per&s;on in this army for it, as well as the olde&s;t captain in the &s;ervice, having di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf at the head of a rifle company all the la&s;t
<PB N="92" REF="031423_0091_0FEC4B4281045488">
war, and highly merited the approbation of his &s;uperior offi|cers.</P>
<P>Colonel Mifflin informed me to-day of his having received tent-cloths from Mr. Barrell of Philadelphia, to the amount of &s;even thou&s;and five hundred pounds Penn&s;ylvania currency, and applied for a warrant for payment of it. But, as our fund is low, and many nece&s;&s;ary demands again&s;t it which mu&s;t be &s;a|tisfied,&mdash;and our calls for money are and will be exceedingly great,&mdash;I could not grant it, thinking it might be convenient for payment to be made in Philadelphia, by your order on the trea&s;ury there.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is with the greate&s;t plea&s;ure I inform you, that, on &s;un|day la&s;t, the &s;eventeenth in&s;tant, about nine o'clock in the fore|noon, the mini&s;terial army evacuated the town of Bo&s;ton, and that the forces of the United Colonies are now in actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion there|of. I beg leave to congratulate you, &s;ir, and the honorable Con|gre&s;s, on this happy event, and particularly as it was effected with|out endangering the lives and property of the remaining unhappy inhabitants.</P>
<P>I have great rea&s;on to imagine their flight was precipitated by the appearance of a work which I had ordered to be thrown up la&s;t &s;aturday night on an eminence at Dorche&s;ter, which lay neare&s;t to Bo&s;ton neck called Nuke-hill.</P>
<P>The town, although it has &s;uffered greatly, is not in &s;o bad a &s;tate as I expected to find it; and I have a particular plea&s;ure in being able to inform you, &s;ir, that your hou&s;e has received no dam|age worth mentioning. Your furniture is in tolerable order, and the family pictures are all left entire and untouched. Captain Caz|neau takes the charge of the whole, until he &s;hall receive further orders from you.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the mini&s;terial troops had quitted the town, I order|ed a thou&s;and men (who had had the &s;mall-pox,) under command of general Putnam, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heights, which I &s;hall endeavour to fortify in &s;uch a manner as to prevent their return, &s;hould they attempt it. But, as they are &s;till in the harbor, I tho't it not prudent to march off with the main body of the army until I &s;hould be fully &s;atisfied they had quitted the coa&s;t. I have there|fore only detached five regiments, be&s;ides the rifle battalion, to
<PB N="93" REF="031423_0092_0FEC4B4879B51628">
New-York, and &s;hall keep the remainder here till all &s;u&s;picion of their return cea&s;es.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation in which I found their works evidently di&s;co|vered that their retreat was made with the greate&s;t precipita|tion. They have left their barracks and other works of wood at Bunker's-hill, &amp;c. all &s;tanding, and have de&s;troyed but a &s;mall part of their lines. They have al&s;o left a number of fine pieces of cannon which they fir&s;t &s;piked up, al&s;o a very large iron mortar; and, as I am informed, they have thrown another over the end of your wharf. I have employed proper per&s;ons to drill the can|non, and doubt not I &s;hall &s;ave the mo&s;t of them.&mdash;I am not yet able to procure an exact li&s;t of all the &s;tores they have left.&mdash;As &s;oon as it can be done, I &s;hall take care to tran&s;mit it to you.&mdash;From an e&s;timate of what the quarter-ma&s;ter-general has al|ready di&s;covered, the amount will be twenty-five or thirty thou|&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>Part of the powder mentioned in yours of the &s;ixth in&s;tant, has already arrived. The remainder I have ordered to be &s;topped on the road, as we &s;hall have no occa&s;ion for it here.&mdash;The letter to general Thomas, I immediately &s;ent to him. He de&s;ired leave for three or four days, to &s;ettle &s;ome of his private affairs; after which he will &s;et out for his command in Canada.&mdash;I am happy that my conduct in intercepting lord Drummond's letter is approv|ed of by Congre&s;s.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I had the honor to addre&s;s you on the nineteenth in&s;tant upon the evacuation of the town of Bo&s;ton by the mi|ni&s;terial army, I fully expected, as their retreat and embarkation were hurried and precipitate, that, before now, they would have departed the harbor, and been far in their pa&s;&s;age to the place of their de&s;tination. But, to my &s;urpri&s;e and di&s;appoint|ment, the fleet is &s;till in Nanta&s;ket road. The purpo&s;e induc|ing their &s;tay is altogetoer unknown: nor can I &s;ugge&s;t any &s;atisfactory rea&s;on for it. On wedne&s;day night la&s;t, before the whole of the fleet fell down to Nanta&s;ket, they demoli&s;hed the ca&s;tle and hou&s;es belonging to it, by burning them down, and the &s;everal fortifications. They left a great number of cannon, but have rendered all of them except a very few, entirely u&s;e|le&s;s, by breaking off the trunnions; and tho&s;e they &s;piked up:
<PB N="94" REF="031423_0093_0FEC4B4E80BC1858">
but they may be made &s;erviceable again:&mdash;&s;ome are already done.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal ve&s;&s;els in the docks, which were taken by the enemy (&s;ome with, and others without cargoes,) which dif|ferent per&s;ons claim as their property and right. Are they to be re&s;tored to their former owners on making proof of their title, or to belong to the continent, as captures made from the enemy?&mdash;I wi&s;h Congre&s;s would direct a mode of proceeding again&s;t them, and e&s;tabli&s;h a rule for deci&s;ion: they appear to me to be highly nece&s;&s;ary. In like manner, &s;ome of the can|non which are in Bo&s;ton are &s;aid to have come from the ca&s;tle. Suppo&s;ing them, with tho&s;e remaining at the ca&s;tle, to have been purcha&s;ed by and provided originally at the expence of this province,&mdash;are they now to be con&s;idered as belonging to it, or to the public? I beg leave to refer the matter to the opinion of Congre&s;s, and pray their direction how I am to conduct re&s;pect|ing them.</P>
<P>It having been &s;ugge&s;ted to me that there was con&s;iderable property, &amp;c. belonging to per&s;ons who had, from the fir&s;t of the pre&s;ent unhappy conte&s;t, manife&s;ted an unfriendly and inveter|ate di&s;po&s;ition, in the town of Bo&s;ton, I thought it prudent to write to the honorable general court upon the &s;ubject, that it might be enquired after and &s;ecured. A copy of the letter I herewith &s;end you, and &s;ubmit it to Congre&s;s through you, whether they will not determine how it is to be di&s;po&s;ed of, and as to the appropriation of the money ari&s;ing from the &s;ale of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the town was abandoned by the enemy, I judged it advi&s;able to &s;ecure the &s;everal heights, le&s;t they &s;hould attempt to return; and, for this purpo&s;e, have cau&s;ed a large and &s;trong work to be thrown up at Fort-hill, a po&s;t of great im|portance, as it commands the whole harbor, and, when fortified, if properly &s;upported, will greatly annoy any fleet the enemy may &s;end again&s;t the town, and render the landing of their troops exceedingly difficult, if not impracticable. This work is almo&s;t done, and in a little time will be complete: and, that the communication between the town and country may be free and open, I have ordered all the lines upon the neck to be im|mediately de&s;troyed, and the other works on the &s;ides of the town facing the country, that the inhabitants from the latter may not be impeded, and afforded an ea&s;y entrance, in ca&s;e the enemy &s;hould gain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion at any future time. The&s;e mat|ters I conceived to be within the line of my duty; of which I advi&s;ed the general court, and recommended to their attention
<PB N="95" REF="031423_0094_0FEC4B507A96BBC8">
&s;uch other mea&s;ures as they might think nece&s;&s;ary for &s;ecuring the town again&s;t the ho&s;tile de&s;igns of the enemy.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t got an inventory of &s;tores and property belonging to the crown, which the enemy left in Bo&s;ton, at the ca&s;tle, and Bunker's-hill,&mdash;which I have the honor to tran&s;mit you; and &s;hall give &s;trict orders that a careful attention be had to any more that may be found. I &s;hall take &s;uch precautions re|&s;pecting them, that they may be &s;ecure, and turn to the pub|lic advantage, as much as po&s;&s;ible, or circum&s;tances will admit of.</P>
<P>A Mr. Bulfinch from Bo&s;ton, who acted as a clerk to Mr. . . . . . ., having put into my hands a lift of rations drawn the &s;aturday before the troops evacuated the town, I have inclo&s;ed it for your in&s;pection. He &s;ays, neither the &s;taff officers nor women are included in the li&s;t; from which it appears that their number is greater than we had an idea of.</P>
<P>Major-general Ward and brigadier general Fyre are de&s;irous of leaving the &s;ervice, and, for that purpo&s;e, have reque&s;ted me to lay the matter before Congre&s;s that they may be allowed to re&s;ign their commi&s;&s;ions. The papers containing their applications you will herewith receive. They will give you a full and more particular information upon the &s;ubject; and therefore I &s;hall take the liberty of referring you to them.</P>
<P>I would mention to Congre&s;s that the commi&s;&s;ary of artillery &s;tores has informed me, that whatever powder has been &s;ent to this camp has always come without any bill a&s;certaining the number of ca&s;ks or quantity. This it is probable, has proceed|ed from forgetfulne&s;s or inattention in the per&s;ons appointed to &s;end it, or the negligence of tho&s;e who brought it, though they have declared otherwi&s;e, and that they never had any. As it may in &s;ome mea&s;ure prevent embezzlements (though I do not &s;u&s;pect any to have been made), and the commi&s;&s;ary will know what and how much to receive, and be enabled to di&s;cover mi&s;|takes if any &s;hould happen,&mdash;I &s;hould be glad if you will direct a bill of parcels to be always &s;ent in future.</P>
<P>There have been &s;o many accounts from England, all agree|ing that commi&s;&s;ioners are coming to America, to propo&s;e terms for an accommodation, as they &s;ay,&mdash;that I am inclined to think the time of their arrival not very far off.&mdash;If they come to Bo&s;|ton (which probably will be the ca&s;e, if they come to America at all) I &s;hall be under much embarre&s;&s;ment re&s;pecting the manner of receiving them, and the mode of treatment that ought to be u&s;ed. I therefore pray that Congre&s;s will give me directions, and point out the line of conduct to be pur&s;ued,&mdash;
<PB N="96" REF="031423_0095_0FEC477EC83618B8">
whether they are to be con&s;idered as amba&s;&s;adors and to have a pa&s;s or permit for repairing through the country to Philadelphia or to any other place,&mdash;or whether they are to be re&s;trained in any and what manner. I &s;hall anxiou&s;ly wait their orders, and, whatever they are, comply with them literally.</P>

<P>I now beg leave to inform you that I have ju&s;t received in|telligence, that the whole of the mini&s;terial fleet, be&s;ides three or four &s;hips, got under way this evening at Nanta&s;ket road, and were &s;tanding out for &s;ea; in con&s;equence of which, I &s;hall detach a brigade of &s;ix regiments immediately from hence for New-York, under the command of brigadier-general Sullivan (brigadier-general Heath having gone with the fir&s;t); which will be &s;ucceeded by another in a day or two; and directly after, I &s;hall forward the remainder of the army (except four or five regiments which will be left for taking care of the bar|racks and public &s;tores, and fortifying the town, and erecting &s;uch works for its defence as the honorable general court may think nece&s;&s;ary)&mdash;and follow my&s;elf.</P>

<P>Inclo&s;ed you have a copy of the return of ordnance &s;tores left in Bo&s;ton by the enemy.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS honored with your favors of the twenty-fir&s;t and twenty-fifth ultimo, on the &s;econd in&s;tant,&mdash;the former by Mr. Han&s;on, &amp;c,&mdash;the latter by Fe&s;&s;enden. I heartily wi&s;h the money had arrived &s;ooner, that the militia might have been paid as &s;oon as their time of &s;ervice expired. The di&s;appoin|ment has given them great unea&s;ine&s;s, and they are gone home much di&s;&s;atisfied: nor have I been without &s;evere complains from th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> other troops, on the &s;ame account. When I get to New-York, I hope a &s;ufficient &s;um will be there, ready to pay eve|ry claim.</P>
<P>It is not in my power to make report of the deficiency of arms, in compliance with the direction of Congre&s;s, at this time,
<PB N="99" REF="031423_0098_0FEC4B5D591C1DA8">
as &s;ome of the regiments are at, and mo&s;t of the other on their march to New-York; nor do I know that it would an&s;wer any good purpo&s;e, if it were,&mdash;having made repeated applications to the &s;everal a&s;&s;emblies and conventions upon the &s;ubject, and con&s;tantly received for an&s;wer, that they could afford no relief.</P>
<P>When I arrive at New-York, I &s;hall, in pur&s;uance of the order of Congre&s;s, detach four battalions to Canada, if the &s;ituation of affairs will admit of it; and &s;hall be extremely happy if they and the troops already there can effect the important end of their going.</P>
<P>In my letter of the fir&s;t in&s;tant, per po&s;t, I inclo&s;ed you a copy of a letter from governor Cooke, advi&s;ing me of the arri|val of a &s;hip of war, &amp;c. at and near the harbor of Newport. I have now the plea&s;ure to inform you that the report was en|tirely premature, and without any foundation. You have a copy of his letter of the fir&s;t in&s;tant to this effect,&mdash;I wi&s;h the alarm had never been given: it occa&s;ioned general Sullivan and his brigade to make an unnece&s;&s;ary and inconvenient diver&s;ion from their route.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed is a copy of an account, pre&s;ented by the honorable general court, of powder furni&s;hed the continental army by this colony. From the account, it appears that part of it was &s;up|plied before the army was under my command; and therefore I know nothing of it; but have not the &s;malle&s;t doubt of the ju&s;tice of the charge. I &s;hall leave about two hundred barrels of this article with major-general Ward, out of which Congre&s;s will direct him to make a return, if they think proper,&mdash;and al&s;o repayment of what may have been furni&s;hed by the other govern|ments.</P>
<P>A proclamation of general Howe's, i&s;&s;ued a few days before his departure from town, having fallen into my hands, I have inclo&s;ed you a copy, which will probably have been the occa|&s;ion of large quantities of goods being carried away and the removal of many per&s;ons, which otherwi&s;e would not have hap|pened.</P>
<P>Colonel Warren, payma&s;ter-general, finding the army likely to be removed from hence, informed me the other day that the &s;ituation of his affairs and engagements in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the colony are &s;uch, as to prevent him from per&s;onally attendning the army; and offered, in ca&s;e it &s;hould be required, to re&s;ign. This was rather embarra&s;&s;ing. To me it appears indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary that the payma&s;ter-general, with his books, &s;hould be at or near head-quarters, Indeed it is u&s;ual for the head of every department in the army, however di&s;per&s;ed that army

may be, to be with the commanding general, keeping deputies in the &s;maller departments. On the other hand, colonel War|re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">'s merit and attachment to the cau&s;e are &s;uch, that I could do nothing le&s;s than de&s;ire (as &s;ome money mu&s;t be left for the pay and contingent charges of the army which will remain here), he would wait here till Congre&s;s &s;hall be plea&s;ed to give their &s;entiments upon the matter,&mdash;&s;ending, in the mean time, &s;ome per&s;on in whom he could confide, with the money, but little of which there will be to carry, though great the de|mands, as nine of the regiments which have marched to New-York have only received five hundred pounds each, towards their pay for the months of February and March,&mdash;and for others, not a farthing. I hope therefore this matter will be con&s;idered by Congre&s;s, and the re&s;ult tran&s;mitted me as &s;oon as done.</P>
<P>I would al&s;o mention to Congre&s;s that the militia regiments which were la&s;t called upon, in making up their ab&s;tracts, charged pay,&mdash;the officers, from the time they received orders to rai&s;e companies,&mdash;and the privates, from the time they re|&s;pectively engaged to come or were called upon, though they did not march for a con&s;iderable time after,&mdash;&s;ome not within three, four, or twenty days, during all which, they remained at home about their own private affairs, without doing any thing el&s;e than "preparing for the march," as they &s;ay by way of plea. This appeared to me &s;o exceedingly unrea&s;onable, and &s;o contrary to ju&s;tice, that the public &s;hould pay for a longer time than from the day of their march to that of their return, that I ordered the ab&s;tracts to be made out accordingly, and refu&s;ed to give warrants on any other terms. They &s;ay that the enli&s;ting orders, which went out from their governments, give them the pay they claim. The fact may be that &s;omething in the&s;e may &s;eem to authori&s;e it: but I mu&s;t &s;ubmit it to Congre&s;s, and wi&s;h for their deci&s;ion, whether the continent mu&s;t pay it.&mdash;I am, with great e&s;teem, &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM now to inform you that on the fourth in&s;tant I &s;et out from Cambridge, and arrived here on &s;aturday la&s;t. I came through Providence, Norwich, and New-London, in order to &s;ee and expedite the embarkation of the troops. The third brigade, under the command of general Greene, was at New-London
<PB N="101" REF="031423_0100_0FEC47A36FF28940">
when I left it, where there was a &s;ufficient number of tran&s;|ports to embark them,&mdash;and mo&s;t probably would have arrived here before this, had it not been for a &s;evere &s;torm which happened the night they &s;ailed, which di&s;per&s;ed them, and, I fear, has done them &s;ome injury.</P>
<P>General Spencer, with the la&s;t brigade, marched from Rox|bury the day I left Cambridge, and would be at New-London, ready to embark in the return tran&s;ports which brought general Sullivan's divi&s;ion to this place. The whole of the troops may be rea&s;onably expected here in the cour&s;e of this week. The badne&s;s of the roads, and difficulty of procuri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">g teams for bringing the &s;tores, baggage, &amp;c. have greatly prolonged their arrival at this place.</P>
<P>I have not had time, &s;ince I came, to look fully about me; but find many works of defence begun, and &s;ome fini&s;hed.&mdash;The troops are much di&s;per&s;ed,&mdash;&s;ome on Long-I&s;land, others on Staten-I&s;land, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I have ordered four battalions from hence to Canada, and am taking mea&s;ures to have them forwarded to Albany by wa|ter with all po&s;&s;ible expedition. This will greatly expe|dite their arrival, and ea&s;e the men of much fatigue. I have wrote general Schuyler of their coming, that he may have nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures taken to hurry their march to general Tho|mas.</P>
<P>I am informed by general Putnam that the militia, that were called in for the &s;upport of this town, in ca&s;e the mini&s;terial army had arrived before our troops, are all di&s;charged, it being unnece&s;|&s;ary to keep them longer.</P>
<P>All the &s;hips of war, be&s;ides the A&s;ia, moved out of this harbor on &s;aturday, and the A&s;ia ye&s;terday; &s;ome of which are now below the Narrows, and the re&s;t gone to &s;ea.</P>
<P>Your favor of the tenth in&s;tant, by major Sherburne, directed to general Putnam or the commanding officer here, came to hand on &s;aturday evening, with three boxes of money, which I &s;hall deliver the payma&s;ter as &s;oon as he arrives, and tran&s;mit you his receipt for the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Having received information from hence before my depar|ture from Cambridge, that thirty pieces of heavy cannon were wanting, and e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary for the defence of this place, in addition to tho&s;e already here,&mdash;I took the liberty of apply|ing to admiral Hopkins, whom I &s;aw at New-London, for that number, with the mortars and &s;tores he brought from Provi|dence,&mdash;a li&s;t of which he had tran&s;mitted you.

and the harbor at New-London, it was uncertain whether I could have all I wanted; but that he would &s;end me all that could b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;pared.</P>

<P>I HAVE this moment received a letter from general Schuyler, containing inclo&s;ures of a very important nature, co|pies of which, I imagine, are contained in the inclo&s;ed letter to you, which I thought it my duty immediately to forward by expre&s;s, that they may be laid before the honorable Congre&s;s,
<PB N="103" REF="031423_0102_0FEC4B629CFEBAC0">
and proper mea&s;ures pur&s;ued to prevent the fatal effects which are therein apprehended. For my own part, I have done my utmo&s;t to forward the four regiments ordered by Congre&s;s but a variety of incidents have hitherto con&s;pired to prevent their embarkation. The men had &s;carcely recovered them|&s;elves from the fatigues of their march from Bo&s;ton, and are quite unprovided with nece&s;&s;aries. The colonels of the regi|ments, though repeatedly called upon for that purpo&s;e, had ne|glected making out the ab&s;tracts for their pay. All ob&s;tacles however, are now removed; and I hope to begin the embarka|tion this day. Indeed it would have been be&s;t, in my opinion, to have &s;ent the regiments, rai&s;ed in this province and New-Jer&s;ey, upon that &s;ervice, had not the peculiar circum&s;tances under which they were rai&s;ed prevented it. By the terms of their enli&s;tment, they are to &s;erve during the war, and at five dollars per month, on condition, (as I am informed) that they &s;hall not be &s;ent out of tho&s;e provinces. Be&s;ides, they are very ill provided with arms, &s;ome companies not having any. It mu&s;t be a great burden upon the continent to keep &s;uch a number of u&s;ele&s;s men in pay: and yet, if they &s;hould be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and an unexpec|ted &s;upply of arms &s;hould arrive, it may be &s;ound very difficult to replace them.</P>
<P>The officers of the &s;everal corps that have arrived here have been &s;o bu&s;ily employed in fixing their men in quarters, that I have not yet been able to procure an exact return of their numbers. Some are yet behind. As &s;oon as the whole are collected, I &s;hall order the proper returns, and tran&s;mit them to Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>You will plea&s;e to notice what colonel Hazen &s;ays of the di&s;po&s;ition of the Indians. In my opinion, it will be impo&s;&s;i|ble to keep them in a &s;tate of neutrality. They mu&s;t, and, no doubt, &s;oon will take an active part either for or again&s;t us: and I &s;ubmit it to the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s, whether it would not be be&s;t immediately to engage them on our &s;ide, and to u&s;e our utmo&s;t endeavors to prevent their minds being poi|&s;oned by mini&s;terial emi&s;&s;aries, which will ever be the ca&s;e while a king's garri&s;on is &s;uffered to remain in their country. Would it not therefore be advi&s;able to &s;end a &s;ufficient force from the back counties of Penn&s;ylvania, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the garri&s;ons of Nia|gara and Detroit? This, I think, might ea&s;ily be effected, and would an&s;wer the mo&s;t &s;alutary purpo&s;es. The Seneca Indians, who have hitherto appeared friendly to us, might be u&s;efully em|ployed in this bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="031423_0103_0FEC4B645B97EF30">
I am in hopes mo&s;t of the difficulties mentioned in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Hazen's letter will be obviated by the appearance of the re|&s;pectable committee of Congre&s;s in Canada, and the forces that have been and will be &s;ent there. The &s;ecurity of that coun|try is of the utmo&s;t importance to us. This cannot be done &s;o effectually by conque&s;t, as by taking &s;trong hold of the affecti|ons and confidence of the inhabitants.

<P>The honorable Congre&s;s will be able to judge from the papers &s;ent them by general Schuyler, and information they may receive of the de&s;igns of the enemy, whether it is expedient to &s;end a further reinforcement to Canada.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS this day honored with the receipt of your favor of the twentieth in&s;tant. I have now the plea&s;ure to acquaint you that the four regiments de&s;igned for Canada embarked ye&s;|terday with a fair wind for Albany, under the command of colonels Greaton, Patter&s;on, Bond, and Poor; be&s;ides which, there was a company of riflemen, a company of artificers, and two engineers,&mdash;the whole commanded by brigadier-general Thomp&s;on.</P>
<P>I have repeatedly mentioned to the honorable Congre&s;s the di&s;tre&s;sful &s;ituation we are in for want of arms.&mdash;With much pains and difficulty I got mo&s;t of the regiments from the ea&s;t|ward tolerably well furni&s;hed; but find the York regiments very badly provided. Colonel Ritzema's has &s;carcely any: and yet the&s;e men, being enli&s;ted during the war, and at five dollars per month, ought not (in my judgment) to be di&s;charged; as we find it almo&s;t as difficult to get men, as arms. This is a matter of &s;ome importance, which I &s;hould be glad to receive the particular opinion of Congre&s;s upon.</P>
<P>Mr. Baldwin is one of the a&s;&s;i&s;tant engineers ordered to Ca|nada. He is indeed a very u&s;eful man in this department, but
<PB N="105" REF="031423_0104_0FEC4B68EA37E838">
declined the &s;ervice, on account of the pay, which he &s;ays is inadequate to his &s;upport. In order to induce him to continue, I promi&s;ed to repre&s;ent his ca&s;e to Congre&s;s, and would recommend an increa&s;e of his pay, and that he &s;hould have the rank of lieutenant-colonel, of which he is very de&s;erving. I beg leave therefore to recommend him to Congre&s;s, and that they would make provi&s;ion for him accordingly.</P>
<P>A few days ago, application was made to me by the commit|tee of &s;afety for this colony, for an exchange of pri&s;oners. For the particulars I beg leave to refer you to their letter, a copy of which you have inclo&s;ed. As there is a &s;tanding or|der of Congre&s;s that no &s;ailors or &s;oldiers &s;hall be exchanged for citizens, I did not incline to comply with the reque&s;t with|out the particular direction of Congre&s;s: but I have been &s;ince informed, that the pri&s;oners, mentioned in the committee's let|ter as citizens, are really &s;eamen taken from private ve&s;&s;els, but not in arms. How far this may alter the ca&s;e, or how far the rea&s;ons which induced the Congre&s;s to pa&s;s the re&s;olve above-mentioned may &s;till exi&s;t, mu&s;t be left to their determination.</P>
<P>The militia, who, on my application were ordered to this place to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion until I &s;hould arrive with the continen|tal forces, were obliged to return home without their pay, as there was not then money &s;ufficient in the trea&s;ury for that purpo&s;e, and to an&s;wer the exigencies of the army. This occa|&s;ioned great unea&s;ine&s;s among them, and may be attended with very bad con&s;equences in ca&s;e we &s;hould have occa&s;ion for their &s;ervice on any future emergency. I therefore beg the Con|gre&s;s would make provi&s;ion for their pay, and point out parti|cularly, whether it is to be done by the commander of the continental forces, or by the provincial a&s;&s;emblies or conventions from whence they are &s;ent.</P>
<P>As the time for which the riflemen enli&s;ted, will expire on the fir&s;t of July next, and as the lo&s;s of &s;uch a valuable and brave body of men will be of great injury to the &s;ervice, I would &s;ubmit it to the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s, whether it would not be be&s;t to adopt &s;ome method to induce them to continue. They are indeed a very u&s;eful corps; but I need not mention this, as their importance is already well known to the Congre&s;s. It is nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould pay an early attention to this matter, as we know from pa&s;t experience, that men are very &s;low in re-enli&s;ting.</P>
<P>When I had the honor of &s;eeing admiral Hopkins at New-London, he repre&s;ented to me the weak &s;tate of his fleet, occa|&s;ioned by &s;ickne&s;s and the damage he received in his engage|ment
<PB N="106" REF="031423_0105_0FEC4B6AA4042B48">
with the enemy; and reque&s;ted I would &s;pare him two hun|dred men to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in a de&s;ign he had formed of attacking Wallace. This I readily con&s;ented to; and the men are to be returned as &s;oon as the &s;ervice is performed.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h it was in my power at pre&s;ent to furni&s;h general Lee with the companies of artillery he de&s;ires.&mdash;I have already &s;ent two companies to Quebec; and I have not yet been able to procure a return of tho&s;e that are here. I expect colonel Knox every moment, and &s;hall then be able to determine whether any can be &s;pared from hence. Blankets we are in great want of, our&s;elves; and it was with great difficulty a few could be procured for the riflemen that were ordered for Canada.</P>
<P>I inclo&s;e you Mr. Winthrop's receipt for two hundred thou&s;and dollars, brought &s;ome time ago from Philadelphia by major Sherburne, which you will plea&s;e to deliver to the continental trea&s;urers.</P>
<P>On my arrival here, I found that Mr. Living&s;ton had been appointed by the provincial Congre&s;s, a commi&s;&s;ary, to furni&s;h the continental troops &s;tationed in this city, with provi&s;ions. I &s;uppo&s;e this was done becau&s;e there was no continental com|mi&s;&s;ary then on the &s;pot. Mr. Living&s;ton &s;till claims a right of furni&s;hing all the troops but tho&s;e lately arrived from Cam|bridge. Mr. Trumbull is now here: and, as I con&s;ider him as the principal in that office, I &s;hould be glad to know whether any part of the continental troops is to be furni&s;hed by any other than their commi&s;&s;ary-general. I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, that to me it appears very incon&s;i&s;tent, and mu&s;t create great confu|&s;ion in the accounts as well as in the contracts.&mdash;I intended to have laid before Congre&s;s the amount of the rations, as &s;upplied by colonel Trumbull and Mr. Living&s;ton; and called upon tho&s;e gentlemen to furni&s;h me with a &s;eperate e&s;timate for that purpo&s;e. Colonel Trumbull has given me his, by which it ap|pears he &s;upplies the troops at eight pence and one-third per ration. I have not yet received any from Mr. Living&s;ton; but am informed his contract is at ten pence half-penny. The dif|ference is immen&s;e, as it will amount to no le&s;s than two hun|dred pounds per day, for twenty thou&s;and men. It is indeed to be con&s;idered that Mr. Living&s;ton's contract is, including every other charge; and that to Mr. Trumbull's mu&s;t be added &s;tore-hire, clerks, and every other contingent expence. But even then it will not amount to &s;o much as Mr. Living&s;ton's, by a penny per ration, which in the gro&s;s, will be &s;omething very con&s;iderable. I thought it my duty, without prejudice or partiality, to &s;tate the matter fairly to Congre&s;s, that they
<PB N="107" REF="031423_0106_0FEC4B73E07EF840">
might take &s;uch order upon it as to them &s;hall &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary, I cannot, however, in ju&s;tice to Mr. Trumbull, help adding that he has been indefatigable in &s;upplying the army; and I believe, from his connections in New-England, is able to do it on as good terms as any per&s;on in America.</P>
<P>The &s;everal matters contained in the foregoing, I mu&s;t beg the early attention of Congre&s;s to; and that I may be favored with an an&s;wer as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN a letter which I had the honor to receive from Con|gre&s;s &s;ome con&s;iderable time ago, they were plea&s;ed to a&s;k what rank aids-de-camp bore in the army? from whence I conclud|ed that they had adverted to the extraordinary trouble and con|finement of tho&s;e gentlemen, with a view to make them an ade|quate allowance. But nothing being &s;ince done or &s;aid of the matter, I take the liberty,&mdash;un&s;olicited by, and unknown to my aids-de-camp,&mdash;to inform your honorable body that their pay is not by any means equal to their trouble and confinement.</P>
<P>No per&s;on wi&s;hes more to &s;ave money to the public, than I do: and no per&s;on has aimed more at it. But there are &s;ome ca&s;es in which par&s;imony may be ill placed; and this I take to be one. Aids-de-camp are per&s;ons in whom entire confidence mu&s;t be placed: it requires men of abilities to execute the du|ties with propriety and di&s;patch, where there is &s;uch a multi|plicity of bu&s;ine&s;s, as mu&s;t attend the commander-in-chief of &s;uch an army as ours: and per&s;uaded I am, that nothing but the zeal of tho&s;e gentlemen (who live with me, and act in this ca|pacity) for the great American cau&s;e,&mdash;and per&s;onal attachment to me,&mdash;has induced them to undergo the trouble and confinement they have experienced &s;ince they have become members of my family.</P>
<P>I give into no kind of amu&s;ements my&s;elf; and con&s;equently tho&s;e about me can have none, but are confined from morning till eve, hearing and an&s;wering the applications and letters of one and another, which will now, I expect, receive a pretty con&s;iderable addition, as the bu&s;ine&s;s of the northern and ea&s;t|ern departments (if I continue here) mu&s;t, I &s;uppo&s;e, pa&s;s through my hands. If the&s;e gentlemen had the &s;ame relaxation from duty as other officers have in their common routine, there would not be &s;o much in it. But, to have the mind always up|on
<PB N="108" REF="031423_0107_0FEC4B786DC42FC0">
the &s;tretch,&mdash;&s;carce ever unbent,&mdash;and no hours for recrea|tion,&mdash;makes a material odds. Knowing this, and at the &s;ame time how inadequate the pay is, I can &s;carce find inclination to impo&s;e the nece&s;&s;ary duties of their office upon them. To what I have here &s;aid, this further remark may be made, and is a matter of no &s;mall concernment to me, and, in its con&s;equences, to the public:&mdash;and that is, that, while the duty is hard and the pay &s;mall, it is not to be wondered at, if there &s;hould be found a promptne&s;s in them to &s;eek preferment, or in me to do ju&s;tice to them by facilitating their views; by which means I mu&s;t lo&s;e their aid when they have it mo&s;t in their power to a&s;|&s;i&s;t me.&mdash;Influenced by the&s;e motives, I have taken the liberty of laying the matter fully, and with all due deference, before your honorable body, not doubting its meeting with a patient hearing.</P>

<P>THAT I might be in readine&s;s to take the field in the &s;pring, and prepared for any &s;ervice Congre&s;s &s;hould think proper to &s;end me upon, this campaign,&mdash;I de&s;ired colonel Reed, when he left Cambridge in the fall, to get me a &s;et of camp equi|page, tents, and baggage-waggons, made at Philadelphia under his own in&s;pection, and &s;ent to me. This, he informs me, is now done, and ready to come on.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received by la&s;t evening's po&s;t a letter from Jo&s;hua Wentworth, e&s;quire, of Port&s;mouth, whom I had appointed agent for our little fleet in that province. It is dated the fif|teenth in&s;tant; an extract from which I have the honor of tran|&s;cribing for your peru&s;al.</P>
<P>"The third in&s;tant, commodore Manly brought in the bri|gantine Elizabeth, one of the third divi&s;ion which &s;ailed from Nanta&s;ket, with a valuable cargo of Engli&s;h goods, and a few
<PB N="109" REF="031423_0108_0FEC4B7A57DF4848">
hog&s;heads of rum and &s;ugar, by a Mr. J * * *, who was a pa&s;&s;enger, part freighter, and a very great tory. Suppo&s;e the cargo worth twenty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. Tho&s;e goods are, the greate&s;t part, owned by the inhabitants of Bo&s;ton, and by &s;ome that were inhabitants when the troops left it,&mdash;the re&s;idue by this Mr. J * * *, and others of the &s;ame ca&s;t. The complicate &s;tate of this prize required my immediate &s;etting off for Bo&s;ton, expecting I might find &s;ome directions for my government there; when I waited on general Ward, who was obliging enough to give me his opinion (but not able to direct, having received no in&s;tructions to the point) that the ve&s;&s;el and cargo mu&s;t be libelled, and a dividend to the captors would follow, of all &s;uch goods as might be legally claimed by the friends to America; and tho&s;e that were the property of them inimical, might be decreed forfeited. Upon further inquiry, I was in|formed a re&s;olve pa&s;&s;ed in Congre&s;s that all ve&s;&s;els and goods, retaken previous to a condemnation by a Briti&s;h court of Ad|miralty, were liable to a partial decree (by every colony judge) to the captors,&mdash;not more than one-third, nor le&s;s than one-fourth. The pre&s;ent prize falls under this re&s;olve: and any other, that [<HI>makes the</HI>] property of our internal enemies liable to a full confi&s;cation, may be nece&s;&s;ary for my government: therefore &s;hall be much obliged by your full direction of this capture, and a copy of the continental re&s;olves thereon. This brigantine is owned by a Mr. Richard Hart of this town, taken on her return from the We&s;t-Indies la&s;t October and carried into Bo&s;ton, not condemned. The rum on board are &s;eventeen hog&s;heads,&mdash;and four of &s;ugar, not removed out of her from the time of capture. The other cargo was in general &s;tolen by virtue of general Howe's proclamation (which undoubtedly you have &s;een) appointing one C * * * B * * * &s;uperintendant, who, by the way, was taken in the prize, and is now confined in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts colony, with Mr. J * * * and &s;undry others, by order of the general court, to whom general Ward delivered them.</P>
<P>"There were a &s;erjeant and twelve privates of the fourth, or king's own regiment, taken pri&s;oners on board, with the others, making &s;ixty-three &s;ouls.</P>
<P>"There appeared from the pillage of this cargo by many of the pa&s;&s;engers, the property was in him who could &s;ecret the mo&s;t. For when examining the che&s;ts and bedding of the pri|&s;oners, I found great quantity of goods that they had collected while on board, which were taken out of ware hou&s;es without packing, and hove promi&s;cuou&s;ly on board the ve&s;&s;el. Even
<PB N="110" REF="031423_0109_0FEC4B7CB2C9ADB0">
the &s;ailors had provided for their di&s;po&s;al at plea&s;ure. In fact, the de&s;truction of property under cover of general Howe's proclama|tion, is unparalelled. * * *</P>
<P>"I am now di&s;charging the cargo, as it is in a peri&s;hing &s;i|tuation; and, when &s;elected, and the regular cour&s;e pur&s;ued through the admiralty, &s;hall adverti&s;e agreeable to his excellency's in&s;tructions to general Ward, who was obliging enough to give me an ab&s;tract.</P>
<P>"The general court of this province, finding a difficulty in ma|king a code of laws for the admiralty court, did not complete that in&s;titution their la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, when they adjourned to June; which lap&s;e of time will not admit my facilitating the di&s;po&s;al of the pri|zes under my care, &s;o early as I could wi&s;h, for the &s;afety of part of the intere&s;t of the Su&s;anna's cargo, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the porter, which I fear may be &s;poiled by lying &s;o long,&mdash;it not having equal body to that commonly imported for &s;ale;&mdash;which induces me to de&s;ire your direction for a di&s;po&s;al of that article either at pri|vate or public &s;ale."</P>
<P>That, &s;ir, is an exact copy of part of Mr. Wentworth's letter to Mr. Moylan. I now reque&s;t you will plea&s;e to dirct me, in what manner I &s;hall in&s;truct the agent re&s;pecting the complicat|ed cargo, and whether he may be empowered to di&s;po&s;e of the por|ter or any other articles on board the prizes under his care, which the delay of e&s;tabli&s;hing the court of admiralty may make liable to peri&s;h.</P>
<P>I have not yet heard that there has been any trial of the pri|zes carried into Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts bay. This procra&s;tination is at|tended with very bad con&s;equences. Some of the ve&s;&s;els I had fitted out are now laid up, the crews being di&s;&s;atisfied that they cannot get their prize-money. I have tired the Congre&s;s upon this &s;ubject: but the importance of it makes me again mention, that, if a &s;ummary way of proceeding is not re&s;olved on, it will be impo&s;&s;ible to get our ve&s;&s;els manned. I mu&s;t al&s;o mention to you, &s;ir, that captain Manly and his crew are de&s;irous to know when they may expect their part of the value of the ord|nance &s;tores taken la&s;t fall. They are anxious to know what the amount may be. As the inventory of that cargo is in the hands of Congre&s;s, I would humbly &s;ubmit it to them, whether a valuation therof &s;hould not be made, and the captors' dividend be remitted them as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. It will give them &s;pirit, and encourage them to be alert in looking out for other prizes.</P>
<P>Several officers belonging to the regiments rai&s;ed in the&s;e middle colonies inform me that their men (notwith&s;tanding their agreement) begin to murmur at the di&s;tinction of pay made be|tween
<PB N="111" REF="031423_0110_0FEC4B8132CB72D0">
them and the regiments from the ea&s;tward. I would be glad that the Congre&s;s would attend to this in time, le&s;t it may get to &s;uch a pitch as will be difficult to &s;uppre&s;s. They argue that they perform the &s;ame duty, undergo the &s;ame fatigue, and receive five dollars, when the ea&s;tern regiments receive &s;ix dol|lars and two-thirds per month. For my own part, I wi&s;h they were all upon the &s;ame footing: for, if the Briti&s;h army will not face this way, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to detach a great part of our troops: in that ca&s;e, I would, for many rea&s;ons, be &s;orry there &s;hould be any di&s;tinctions of regiments that are all in the pay of the United Colonies.</P>
<P>The deficiency of arms (in the New-York regiments e&s;pecially) is very great. If I am rightly informed, there are &s;carce as many in colonel Ritzema's regiment as will arm one compa|ny.&mdash;Can the Congre&s;s remedy this evil? If they can, there &s;hould not a moment be lo&s;t in effecting it, as our &s;trength at pre&s;ent is, in reality, on paper only. Should we think of di&s;|charging tho&s;e men who are without arms, the remedy would be wor&s;e than the di&s;ea&s;e: for, by vigorous exertions, I hope arms may be procured; and I well know that the rai&s;ing men is ex|ceeding difficult, e&s;pecially to be engaged during the continuance of the war, which is the footing on which colonel Ritzema's regi|ment is engaged.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 26.&mdash;I had wrote thus far before I was honored with your favor of the twenty-third in&s;tant. In obedience to the order therein contained, I have directed &s;ix regiments more for Canada, which will embark as &s;oon as ve&s;&s;els and other ne|ce&s;&s;aries can be provided. The&s;e regiments will be command|ed by general Sullivan. I &s;hall give him in&s;tructions to join the forces in that country under general Thomas, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to &s;ending more troops to that country, I am really at a lo&s;s what to advi&s;e, as it is impo&s;&s;ible at pre&s;ent to know the de&s;igns of the enemy. Should they &s;end the whole force under general Howe up the river St. Laurence to relieve Quebec and re|cover Canada, the troops gone and now going will be in&s;ufficient to &s;top their progre&s;s: and &s;hould they think proper to &s;end that or an equal force this way from Great Britain for the purpo&s;e of po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing this city and &s;ecuring the navigation of Hud&s;on's river, the troops left here will not be &s;ufficient to oppo&s;e them: and yet, for any thing we know, I think it not improbable they may attempt both,&mdash;both being of the greate&s;t importance to them,&mdash;if they have men.</P>
<P>I could wi&s;h indeed that the army in Canada &s;hould be more
<PB N="112" REF="031423_0111_0FEC4B85AAA9D448">
powerfully reinforced: at the &s;ame time I am con&s;cious that the tru&s;ting this important po&s;t (which is now become the grand magazine of America) to the handful of men remaining here, is running too great a ri&s;k. The &s;ecuring this po&s;t and Hud&s;on's river is to us al&s;o of &s;o great importance, that I cannot at pre|&s;ent advi&s;e the &s;ending any more troops from hence:&mdash;on the contrary, the general officers now here, whom I thought it my duty to con&s;ult, think it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to increa&s;e the ar|my at this place with at lea&s;t ten thou&s;and men, e&s;pecially when it is con&s;idered, that, from this place only, the army in Canada mu&s;t draw its &s;upplies of ammunition, provi&s;ions, and, mo&s;t pro|bably, of men; and that all reinforcements can be &s;ent from hence much ea&s;ier than from any other place. By the inclo&s;ed return, you will &s;ee the &s;tate of the army here, and that the number of effective men is far &s;hort of what the Congre&s;s mu&s;t have expected.</P>
<P>I have found it nece&s;&s;ary to order colonel Dayton's regiment from New-Jer&s;ey, to march as one of the &s;ix to Canada: where|fore I mu&s;t recommend it to Congre&s;s to order two companies of one of the regiments &s;till in Penn&s;ylvania to march to Cape-May, which can be done much &s;ooner: for, had this de&s;tination of that regiment not taken place, it would have been very inconvenient to have detached two companies from it to that place; as the march would (according to lord Sterling's and other accounts) have been at lea&s;t two hundred miles from Amboy, and they mu&s;t have pa&s;&s;ed within twenty miles of Philadelphia, there being no practi|cable road along the &s;ea-coa&s;t of New-Jer&s;ey for their baggage to have pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Dr. Potts, who is bearer hereof, was, I under&s;tand, appoint|ed director of the ho&s;pital for the&s;e middle colonies; but the army being removed, with the general ho&s;pital, from the ea&s;t|ward, does in cour&s;e &s;upercede him. He is inclined to go to Canada, where he may be very u&s;eful, if a per&s;on is not already appointed for that department.&mdash;I would humbly beg leave to a&s;k the Congre&s;s whether, in all the appointments, it would not be be&s;t to have but one chief, to whom all the others &s;hould be &s;ub|ordinate.</P>

<P>I AM honored with your favor of the thirteenth ultimo, and ob&s;erve what Congre&s;s have done re&s;pecting the &s;ettlement of the payma&s;ter's accounts. This &s;eems expedient, as he is out of office, and, I am certain, will be attended with but little if any difficulty; nothing more being nece&s;&s;ary, than to com|pare the warrants with his debts, and the receipts he has given, with his credits. I wi&s;h every other &s;ettlement as ea&s;y, and that a committee was appointed to examine and audit the ac|counts
<PB N="114" REF="031423_0113_0FEC4B8E81E6D100">
upon which the warrants are founded, particularly tho&s;e of the quarter-ma&s;ter and commi&s;&s;ary-general's. They are long and of high amount, con&s;i&s;ting of a variety of charges,&mdash;of cour&s;e more intricate,&mdash;and will require time and an extraordinary de|gree of attention to adju&s;t and liquidate in a proper manner.&mdash;Up|on this &s;ubject, I did my&s;elf the honor to write you a con&s;iderable time ago.</P>
<P>Having had &s;everal complaints from the officers in the ea&s;t|ern regiments, who have been, and are engaged in recruiting, about the expen&s;e attending it, and for which they have never yet been allowed any thing, though the officers in the&s;e go|vernments have, as I am informed.&mdash;I &s;hall be glad to know whether the allowance of ten &s;hillings, granted to the officers for every man enli&s;ted, by the re&s;olve of Congre&s;s in [<HI>January</HI>], is general and indi&s;criminate, or confined to the middle di&s;tricts. If general, mu&s;t I have retro&s;pect to the time of the re&s;olves and pay for the &s;ervices &s;ince, or only for future enli&s;tments?</P>
<P>In a letter I wrote to Congre&s;s the twenty-fifth of December, I inclo&s;ed one I had received from Jacob Bailey, e&s;quire, about opening a road from Newbury to Canada. I have received another of the fifteenth ultimo: and, from his account and the intelli|gence I have from others upon enquiry, I have no doubt of the practicability of the mea&s;ure; and am well informed that the di&s;tance will be con&s;iderably &s;hortened, in&s;omuch that our peo|ple going from any part of the New-England governments ea&s;tward of Connecticut-river, to Canada, or returning from thence home, will perform their march in five or &s;ix days le&s;s time than by coming or going any way now u&s;ed. Add to this, that the road may be &s;o conducted (as it is &s;aid) as to go to the river Mi&s;&s;i&s;que, from whence the water carriage to St. John's is good, except forty odd miles,&mdash;or be carried &s;o far to the northward as to keep clear of the lakes altogether, and afford an ea&s;y pa&s;s into Canada at all &s;ea&s;ons. The advantage re&s;ulting from this route being &s;o great and important, I have advanced colonel Bailey two hundred and fifty pounds to begin with, and directed him to exe|cute his plan. No doubt it will require a con&s;iderable ad|vance to accompli&s;h it: but that will be &s;oon &s;unk. The expen&s;e &s;aved by taking off &s;ix days' pay and provi&s;ions from the &s;oldiers returning to the ea&s;tern governments at the expiration of this cam|paign, will be almo&s;t if not more than equal to the charge incurred in opening it. If not,&mdash;as in all probability there will be often a nece&s;&s;ity for &s;ending detachments of our troops to Canada from tho&s;e governments, and for others to return, it will &s;oon be repaid.</P>

By a letter from general Schuyler, of the twenty-&s;eventh ultimo, I find general Thomp&s;on and his brigade were at Albany; general Sullivan with the la&s;t (except three or four companies of colonel Wayne's regiment, not yet come) is embarked and gone, and pro|bably will be &s;oon there. I am apprehen&s;ive, from general Schuy|ler's account, that they will not proceed with the wi&s;hed for expe|dition, owing to a difficulty in getting teams and provinder for cattle, nece&s;&s;ary to carry their baggage, and a &s;carcity of bat|teaux at the lakes for &s;o large a number, though he is taking the utmo&s;t pains to procure them. Should they be &s;topped for any time, it will be exceedingly unfortunate, as their going from hence has weakened us here much, and our army in Canada will not be &s;trengthened.</P>
<P>I have &s;ent with the la&s;t brigade &s;ixty barrels of powder, and o|ther &s;tores and intrenching tools, a &s;upply being a&s;ked for; al&s;o the chain for a boom at the narrows of Richelieu, and the three boxes of money brought by Mr. Han&s;on; and have wrote to Mr. Schuy|ler to have the boom fixed as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.&mdash;The commi&s;&s;ary too has forwarded about eight hundred barrels of pork, and is in expectation of a further quantity from Connecticut, which will go on without &s;topping here.</P>
<P>As the magazine from whence the northern and ea&s;tern ar|mies will occa&s;ionally receive &s;upplies of powder will probably be here, and our &s;tock is low and incon&s;iderable, being much reduced by the &s;ixty barrels &s;ent to Canada, I &s;hall be glad to have a quantity immediately forwarded. Our &s;tores &s;hould be great: for if the enemy make an attack upon the town, or at|tempt to go up the North-river, the expenditure will be very con|&s;iderable. Money too is much wanted:&mdash;the regiments that are paid have only received to the fir&s;t of April, except tho&s;e of Penn&s;ylvania and Jer&s;ey which are gone to Canada: they are paid to the la&s;t of April. By a letter from general Ward, I find his che&s;t is ju&s;t exhau&s;ted; the money which was left with him for the payment of the five regiments at Bo&s;ton and Bever|ly, being almo&s;t expended by large draughts in favor of the commi&s;&s;ary and quarter-ma&s;ter, and in fitting out the armed ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>I would here a&s;k a que&s;tion, to wit, whether, as Mr. War|ren's commi&s;&s;ion is &s;uperceded by Mr. Palfrey's appointment, it will not be nece&s;&s;ary to fix upon &s;ome per&s;on to pay the troops there: or are the payments to go through his hands?&mdash;He does not incline to do any thing in the affair without the direction of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>I have inclo&s;ed you a return of the la&s;t brigade detached, and

<P>I HAVE &s;o often and &s;o fully communicated my want o arms to Congre&s;s, that I &s;hould not have given them the trou|ble of receiving another letter upon this &s;ubject at this time, but for the particular application of colonel Wayne of Penn&s;yl|vania,
<PB N="117" REF="031423_0116_0FEC4B9507AAE018">
who has pointed out a method by which he thinks they may be obtained.</P>
<P>In the hands of the committee of &s;afety at Philadelphia, there are, according to colonel Wayne's account, not le&s;s than two or three thou&s;and &s;tand of arms for provincial u&s;e. From hence he thinks a number might be borrowed by Congre&s;s, pro|vided they are replaced with continental arms as they are brought into the magazine in that city. At a cri&s;is &s;o impor|tant as this, &s;uch a loan might be attended with the mo&s;t &s;ignal advantages,&mdash;while the defencele&s;s &s;tate of the regiments, if no relief can be had, may be productive of fatal con&s;equences.</P>
<P>To give Congre&s;s &s;ome idea of our &s;ituation with re&s;pect to arms&mdash;(and ju&s;tice to my own character requires that it &s;hould be known to them, although the world at large will form their opinion of our &s;trength from numbers, without attending to cir|cum&s;tances)&mdash;it may not be ami&s;s to inclo&s;e a copy of a return which I received a few days ago from the forts in the High|lands, and add, that, by a report from colonel Ritzema's re|giment, of the twenty-ninth ultimo, there appeared to be only ninety-&s;even firelocks and &s;even bayonets belonging thereto: and that all the regiments from the ea&s;tward are deficient from twenty to fifty of the former. Four of tho&s;e companies at the fortifications in the Highlands, belong to colonel Clinton's re|giment; but in what condition the re&s;idue are on account of arms, and how colonel Wyncoop's men are provided, I cannot undertake to &s;ay, but am told, mo&s;t mi&s;erably; as colonel Day|ton's of New-Jer&s;ey, and colonel Wayne's of Penn&s;ylvania al&s;o are. This, &s;ir, is a true, though melancholy de&s;cription of our &s;ituation. The propriety therefore of keeping arms in &s;tore when men in actual pay are in want of them, and who (it is to be pre&s;umed) will, as they ought, bear the heat and burden of the day, is &s;ubmitted with all due deference to the &s;uperior judgment of others.</P>
<P>I cannot by all the enquiries I have been able to make, learn what number of arms have been taken from the tories, where they lie, or how they are to be got at. The committee of &s;afety for this colony have a&s;&s;ured me that no exertions of theirs &s;hall be wanting to procure arms: but our &s;ufferings in the mean time may prove fatal, as men without are in a man|ner u&s;ele&s;s. I have therefore thoughts of employing an agent who&s;e &s;ole bu&s;ine&s;s it &s;hall be to ride through the middle and interior parts of the&s;e governments, for the purpo&s;e of buying up &s;uch arms as the inhabitants may incline to &s;ell, and are fit for u&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="031423_0117_0FEC4B97EFCF9FC0">
The de&s;igns of the enemy are too much behind the curtain for me to form any accurate opinion of their plan of operations for the &s;ummer's campaign. We are left to wander therefore in the field of conjecture: and as no place (all its con&s;equences con&s;idered) &s;eemed of more importance in the execution of their grand plan, than po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them&s;elves of Hud&s;on's river, I thought it advi&s;able to remove with the continental army to this city as &s;oon as the king's troops evacuated Bo&s;ton. But if Congre&s;s, from their knowledge, information, or belief, think it be&s;t for the general good of the &s;ervice that I &s;hould go to the northward or el&s;ewhere, they are convinced, I hope, that they have nothing more to do than &s;ignify their commands.</P>

<P>At a quarter after &s;even this evening, I received by ex|pre&s;s a letter from Thomas Cu&s;hing, e&s;quire, chairman of a committee of the honorable general court, covering one to them for the committee of Salem; copies of which I do my&s;elf the honor to lay before Congre&s;s, that they may judge of the in|telligence contained therein, and direct &s;uch mea&s;ures to be taken upon the occa&s;ion as they may think proper and nece&s;|&s;ary.</P>
<P>I would ob&s;erve, that, &s;uppo&s;ing captain Lee's account to be true in part, I think there mu&s;t be a mi&s;take either in the number of troops or the tran&s;port &s;hips. If there are no more &s;hips than what are mentioned, it is certain there cannot be &s;o many troops. Of this, however, Congre&s;s can judge as well as my&s;elf: and I &s;ubmit to them, whether, upon the whole of the circum&s;tances, and the uncertainty of their de&s;tination (if they were &s;een at all) they chu&s;e that any forces &s;hall be detached from hence, as they will &s;ee, from the returns tran&s;mitted ye&s;|terday, that the number of men now here is but &s;mall and in|con&s;iderable; and (what is to be regretted) no &s;mall part of the&s;e without arms.&mdash;Perhaps, by dividing and &s;ubdividing our force too much, we &s;hall have no one po&s;t &s;ufficiently guar|ded.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM now to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of the fourth and &s;eventh in&s;tant, with their &s;everal inclo&s;ures, and am exceedingly glad, that before the re&s;olution re&s;pecting lieu|tenant-colonel Ogden came to hand, I had ordered him to join his regiment, and had quelled a di&s;agreeable &s;pirit both of mutiny and de&s;ertion, which had taken place and &s;eemed to be ri&s;ing to a great degree in con&s;equence of it. In order to effect it, I had the regiment paraded, and ordered two more at the &s;ame time under arms, convinced them of their error and ill conduct, and obtained a promi&s;e for their good behavior in future. To &s;uch of the men as had ab&s;conded I gave pardons, on their a&s;&s;urances to return to their duty again.</P>
<P>In my letter of the fifth in&s;tant which I had the honor of ad|dre&s;&s;ing you, I mentioned to Congre&s;s the refractory and muti|nous conduct of lieutenant * * * * of the &s;econd regiment, and laid before them a copy of the proceedings of a court-martial upon him, and of his defence, with a view that &s;uch mea&s;ures might be adopted as they &s;hould think adequate to his crime.&mdash;I would now beg leave to inform them, that, &s;ince then, he has appeared &s;en&s;ible of his mi&s;conduct and having made a writ|ten acknowledgment of his offence, and begged pardon for it (as by the enclo&s;ed copy will appear), I thought it be&s;t to re|lea&s;e him from his confinement, and have ordered him to join his regiment; which I hope will meet their approbation, and tender any determination, as to him, unnece&s;&s;ary;&mdash;ob&s;erving at the &s;ame time that I have endeavored, and I flatter my&s;elf, not ineffectually, to &s;upport their authority, and a due &s;ubordination in the army, I have found it of importance and highly expedient to yield many points in fact, without &s;eeming to have done it,&mdash;and this, to avoid bringing on a too frequent di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of matters, which, in a political view, ought to be kept a little behind the curtain, and not be made too much the &s;ubjects of di&s;qui&s;ition.&mdash;Time only can eradicate and overcome cu&s;toms and prejudice of long &s;tanding: they mu&s;t be got the better of, by &s;low and gra|dual advances.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="031423_0119_0FEC4B9EB97A6E88">
I would here take occa&s;ion to &s;ugge&s;t to Congre&s;s (not wi&s;h|ing or meaning of my&s;elf to a&s;&s;ume the &s;malle&s;t degree of power in any in&s;tance) the propriety and nece&s;&s;ity of having their &s;en|timents re&s;pecting the filling up the vacancies and i&s;&s;uing com|mi&s;&s;ions to officers, e&s;pecially to tho&s;e under the rank of field officers. Had I literally complied with the directions given upon this &s;ubject when I fir&s;t engaged in the &s;ervice, and which I con|ceived to be &s;uperceded by a &s;ub&s;equent re&s;olve for forming the army upon the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment, I mu&s;t have employed one clerk for no other bu&s;ine&s;s than i&s;&s;uing warrants of appointment, and giving information to Congre&s;s for their confirmation or re|fu&s;al. It being evident from the nece&s;&s;ity of the thing, that there will be frequent changes and vacancies in office, from death and a variety of other cau&s;es, I now &s;ubmit it to them, and pray their direction whether I am to pur&s;ue that mode and all the ceremonies attending it, or to be at liberty to fill up and grant commi&s;&s;ions at once to &s;uch as may be &s;it and proper per&s;ons to &s;ucceed. * * *</P>
<P>Before I have done, with the utmo&s;t deference and re&s;pect I would beg leave to remind Congre&s;s of my former letters and applications re&s;pecting the appointment of proper per&s;ons to &s;u|perintend and take direction of &s;uch pri&s;oners as have already fal|len and will fall into our hands in the cour&s;e of the war,&mdash;being fully convinced, that, if there were per&s;ons appointed who would take the whole management of them under their care, the con|tinent would &s;ave a con&s;iderable &s;um of money by it, and the pri&s;oners be better treated and provided with real nece&s;&s;aries than they now are;&mdash;and &s;hall take the liberty to add that it appears to me a matter of much importance, and worthy of con&s;ideration, that particular and proper places of &s;ecurity &s;hould be fixed on and e&s;tabli&s;hed in the interior parts of the different governments for their reception.</P>
<P>Such e&s;tabli&s;hments are agreeable to the practice and u&s;age of the Engli&s;h and other nations, and are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ounded on principles of nece&s;&s;ity and public utility. The advantages which will a|ri&s;e from them are obvious and many:&mdash;I &s;hall only mention two or three.&mdash;They will tend much to prevent e&s;capes (which are difficult to effect when the public is once adverti&s;ed that the pri&s;oners are re&s;trained to a few &s;tated and well-known places, and not permitted to go from thence), and the more ingenious among them from di&s;&s;eminating and &s;preading their artful and pernicious intrigues and opinions throughout the country, which would influence the weaker and wavering part of mankind, and meet with but too favorable a hearing. Further, it will be le&s;s
<PB N="121" REF="031423_0120_0FEC4BA9976DAA58">
in their power to join and a&s;&s;i&s;t our enemies in ca&s;es of inva&s;ion, and will give us an opportunity always to know, from the re|turns of tho&s;e appointed to &s;uperintend them, what number we have in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the force &s;ufficient to check and &s;uppre&s;s their ho&s;tile views in times of emergency, and the expences ne|ce&s;&s;ary for their maintenance and &s;upport. Many other rea&s;ons might be adduced to prove the nece&s;&s;ity and expediency of the mea&s;ure;&mdash;I &s;hall only &s;ubjoin one more, and then have done on the &s;ubject,&mdash;which is, that many of the towns where pri|&s;oners have been already &s;ent, not having convenience for or the means of keeping them, complain they are burden&s;ome; and have become carele&s;s, inattentive, and altogether indiffer|ent whether they e&s;cape or not; and tho&s;e of them that are re|&s;tricted to a clo&s;er confinement (the limits of jail) are neglect|ed, and not treated with that care and regard which Congre&s;s wi&s;h.</P>
<P>I have not received further intelligence of the German troops &s;ince my letter of the &s;eventh in&s;tant, covering Mr. Cu&s;hing's di&s;patches. But, le&s;t the account of their coming &s;hould be true, may it not be advi&s;able and good policy to rai&s;e &s;ome companies of our Germans to &s;end among them when they arrive, for exciting a &s;pirit of di&s;affection and de&s;ertion?&mdash;If a few &s;en&s;ible and tru&s;ty fellows could get with them, I &s;hould think they would have great weight and influence with the common &s;oldiery, who certainly have no enmity towards us, having received no injury nor cau&s;e of quarrel from us. The mea&s;ure having occurred, and appearing to me expedient, I thought it prudent to mention it for the con&s;ideration Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>Having received a letter from general Ward, advi&s;ing that Congre&s;s have accepted his re&s;ignation, and praying to be reliev|ed,&mdash;and it being nece&s;&s;ary that a general officer &s;hould be &s;ent to take the command of the troops at Bo&s;ton, e&s;pecially if the army &s;hould arrive which is talked of, and which &s;ome con&s;ider as a probable event.&mdash;I mu&s;t beg leave to recommend to Congre&s;s the appointment of &s;ome brigadier-generals, not having more here (nor &s;o many at this time) than are e&s;&s;ential to the government and conducting the forces and the works that are carrying on.&mdash;Generals Sullivan and Thomp&s;on being ordered to Canada, I can|not &s;pare one more general officer from hence without injuring the &s;ervice greatly, and leaving the army here without a &s;ufficient number.</P>
<P>Having frequent application from the committee of &s;afety and others, about an exchange of pri&s;oners, and not having au|thority to pur&s;ue any other mode in this in&s;tance, than that
<PB N="122" REF="031423_0121_0FEC4BAB60EF88A8">

<P>SINCE my la&s;t of the eleventh in&s;tant, which I had the honor to addre&s;s to you, nothing of moment or importance has occurred; and the principal de&s;ign of this is to communicate to Congre&s;s the intelligence I received la&s;t night from general Schuyler by a letter of the tenth, re&s;pecting the progre&s;s of our troops in getting towards Canada, not doubting of their impatience and anxiety to hear of it and of every thing relating to the expedition. For their more particular information and &s;atisfaction, I have done my&s;elf the plea&s;ure to extract the &s;ub|&s;tance of his letter on this head, which is as follows:&mdash;"that general Thomp&s;on, with the la&s;t of his brigade, on the morning of tue&s;day &s;e'nnight, embarked at Fort-George; and, in the evening of the next day, general Sullivan arrived at Albany;&mdash;that he had ordered an additional number of carpenters to a&s;&s;i&s;t in building boats; who, fini&s;hed eight every day, would have a hundred and ten complete by the twenty-fir&s;t, before which he was fearful the la&s;t of general Sullivan's brigade could not embark;&mdash;that they would carry thirteen men each, be&s;ides the baggage, ammunition, and intrenching tools." * * *</P>
<P>He al&s;o informs, "That the &s;ixty barrels of powder had ar|rived, and would be forwarded that day; that the fir&s;t regi|ment of general Sullivan's brigade marched that morning; and that the intrenching tools and about &s;ix hundred barrels of pork were al&s;o gone on;&mdash;that he cannot po&s;&s;ibly &s;end more than half of the three hundred thou&s;and dollars into Canada, (being greatly in debt on the public account, and the creditors exceedingly clamorous and importunate for payment), which &s;um he hopes will be &s;ufficient, till the Canadians agree to take our paper currency, to which they are mnch aver&s;e, and of which he is exceedingly doubtful:&mdash;that he had got the chain, and would forward it that day to general Arnold, with orders to fix it at the rapids of Richelieu." He adds, "that he had
<PB N="123" REF="031423_0122_0FEC4BAD5BD5A410">
reviewed general Sullivan's brigade in pre&s;ence of about two hundred and &s;ixty Indians, who were greatly plea&s;ed with the order and regularity of the troops, and &s;urpri&s;ed at the number, which, the tories had indu&s;triou&s;ly propagated, con&s;i&s;ted only of three companies, and that they were always kept walking the &s;treets, to induce them to believe their number was much greater than it really was."</P>
<P>I have enclo&s;ed a copy of general Schuyler's in&s;tructions to James Price, e&s;quire, deputy commi&s;&s;ary-general, for the regula|tion of his conduct in that department, which I received la&s;t night, and which general Schuyler reque&s;ted me to forward you.&mdash;I al&s;o beg leave to lay before Congre&s;s, a copy of a letter from Samuel Stringer, director of one of the ho&s;pitals, purport|ing an application for an increa&s;e of &s;urgeon's-mates, &amp;c. an e&s;timate of which is al&s;o inclo&s;ed; and &s;ubmit it to them, what number mu&s;t be &s;ent from hence or got el&s;ewhere. It is highly probable that many more will be wanted in Canada than are already there, on account of the late augmention of the army: but I thought it mo&s;t advi&s;able to make his requi&s;ition known to Congre&s;s, and to take their order and direction upon it.&mdash;As to the medicines, I &s;hall &s;peak to Dr. Morgan (not yet arrived) as &s;oon as he comes, and order him to forward &s;uch as may be nece&s;&s;ary and can be po&s;&s;ibly &s;pared.</P>

<P>YOUR favor of the &s;ixteenth, with &s;everal re&s;olutions of Congre&s;s therein inclo&s;ed, I had not the honor to receive till la&s;t night. Before the receipt, I did not think my&s;elf at liberty to wait on Congre&s;s, although I wi&s;hed to do it; and therefore, the more readily a&s;&s;ented to general Gates's attendance, as I knew there were many matters which could be better explained in a per&s;onal interview than in whole volumes of letters. He accordingly &s;et out for Philadelphia ye&s;terday morning, and mu&s;t have been too far advanced on his journey (as he propo&s;ed expedi|tion) to be overtaken.</P>
<P>I &s;hall, if I can &s;ettle &s;ome matters which are in agitation with the provincial Congre&s;s here, follow to-morrow or next day: and therefore, with every &s;entiment of regard, attach|ment, and gratitude to Congre&s;s, for their kind attention to the means which they think may be conducive to my health, and with particular thanks to you for the politene&s;s of your invi|tation to your hou&s;e, conclude, dear &s;ir, your mo&s;t obedient, &amp;c.</P>

<P>I DO my&s;elf the honor to inform Congre&s;s that I arrived here ye&s;terday afternoon about one o'clock, and found all in a &s;tate of peace and quiet. I had not time to view the works carry|ing on, and tho&s;e ordered to be begun when I went away; but have rea&s;on to believe, from the report of &s;uch of the ge|neral and other officers as I had the plea&s;ure to &s;ee, that they have been pro&s;ecuted and forwarded with all po&s;&s;ible diligence and di&s;patch.</P>
<P>I am much concerned for the &s;ituation of our affairs in Canada, and am fearful, ere this, it is much wor&s;e than was fir&s;t reported at Philadelphia. The intelligence from thence, in a letter from captain Wilkin&s;on of the &s;econd regiment, to general Greene, is truly alarming. It not only confirms the account of colonel Bid|dle and major Sherburne's defeat, but &s;eems to forbode general Ar|nold's, with the lo&s;s of Montreal.&mdash;I have inclo&s;ed a copy of the letter, which will but too well &s;hew that there is foundation for my apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>On wedne&s;day evening I received an expre&s;s from general Schuyler, with &s;undry papers re&s;pecting &s;ir John John&s;ton, which I have not time to copy, as the po&s;t is ju&s;t going off, but will do my&s;elf the honor of tran&s;mitting you as &s;oon as I po&s;&s;i|bly can.</P>
<P>Before I left Philadelphia, I employed a per&s;on to &s;uperintend the building of the gondolas which Congre&s;s had re&s;olved on for this this place. He is arrived, and all things &s;eem to be in a proper channel for facilitating the work: but when they are done, we &s;hall be much in want of guns, having never received any of tho&s;e taken by commodore Hopkins.</P>
<P>Be plea&s;ed to mention me to Congre&s;s with the utmo&s;t re&s;pect: and I am, &s;ir, with every &s;entiment of regard and e&s;teem, your and their obedient &s;ervant,</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my letter of ye&s;terday which I had the honor of ad|dre&s;&s;ing you, and which was de&s;igned to have gone by po&s;t, but was prevented by his departure at the u&s;ual time, I mentioned my having received by expre&s;s a letter and &s;undry papers from general Schuyler, re&s;pecting &s;ir John John&s;ton, copies of which I herewith tran&s;mit you for your in&s;pection and peru&s;al. They will &s;hew you what mea&s;ures were planned and attempted for apprehending him, and &s;ecuring the Scotch Highlanders in Tryon county.</P>
<P>Having heard that the troops at Bo&s;ton are extremely unea|&s;y and almo&s;t mutinous for want of pay (&s;everal months being now due) I mu&s;t take the liberty to repeat a que&s;tion contain|ed in my letter of the fifth ultimo,&mdash;"what mode is to be pur|&s;ued re&s;pecting it?" whether is money to be &s;ent from hence by the payma&s;ter-general, or &s;ome per&s;on &s;ubordinate to him to be appointed there for that purpo&s;e?&mdash;I expected &s;ome direction would have been given in this in&s;tance, long ere this, from what was contained in yours accompanying (or about the time of) the la&s;t remittance. I pre&s;ume it has been omitted by rea&s;on of the multiplicity of important bu&s;ine&s;s before Con|gre&s;s.</P>
<P>In peru&s;ing the &s;everal re&s;olves you honored me with when at Philadelphia and &s;ince my return, I find one allowing a chief engineer for the army in a &s;eparate department. The &s;ervice re|quiring many of them, I wi&s;h Congre&s;s, if they know any per|&s;ons &s;killed in this bu&s;ine&s;s, would appoint them. General Schuy|ler has frequently applied, and &s;ugge&s;ted the nece&s;&s;ity of having &s;ome in Canada.&mdash;I my&s;elf know of none.</P>
<P>I al&s;o find there is a re&s;olve of the third of June, for taking In|dians into the &s;ervice, which, if literally con&s;trued, confines them to that in Canada.&mdash;Is that the meaning of Congre&s;s, or that the commander-in-chief may order their &s;ervice to any place he may think nece&s;&s;ary?</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to the e&s;tabli&s;hing expre&s;&s;es between the &s;everal continental po&s;ts,&mdash;who is to do it?&mdash;the re&s;olves does not &s;ay.&mdash;Is it expected by Congre&s;s that I &s;hould?&mdash;Whoever the work is a&s;&s;igned to, I think &s;hould execute it with the utmo&s;t di&s;patch. The late imperfect and contradictory accounts re|&s;pecting our defeat at the Cedars, &s;trongly point out the ne|ce&s;&s;ity there is for it. No intelligence is yet come from any officer in command there (and mo&s;t probably for want of a pro|per
<PB N="128" REF="031423_0127_0FEC4BBBA27A7638">
channel to convey it,) though this misfortune happened &s;o long ago.</P>
<P>When I had the honor of being in Congre&s;s, if I mi&s;take not, I heard a re&s;olve read, or was told of one, allowing the New|York troops the &s;ame pay as others in the continental &s;ervice.&mdash;This, if any &s;uch, I do not find; and if there is not &s;uch a one, I &s;hall be under &s;ome embarra&s;&s;ment, how to pay the militia to be provided by this province. The re&s;olve providing them, &s;ays they are to be paid, while in &s;ervice, as other troops are. But if tho&s;e enli&s;ted heretofore in this province are to receive according to the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment, it is a matter of doubt, what the militia are to have.</P>
<P>Before this comes to hand, a hand-bill, containing an account of a victory gained by general Arnold over the party that had defeated colonel Biddle and major Sherburne, will mo&s;t proba|bly have reached you. I have inquired into the authenticity of this fortunate report, and have found there is no dependence to be put in it: nor do I believe it de&s;erving of the lea&s;t credit.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS honored ye&s;terday with your favor of the &s;eventh, with its inclo&s;ures. When Dr. Potts arrives, I &s;hall order him to Canada or Lake-George, as may appear mo&s;t proper. It is certainly nece&s;&s;ary that he or Dr. Stringer &s;hould go to the former.&mdash;The re&s;olves re&s;pecting general Woo&s;ter's recall I will immediately tran&s;mit him with directions to repair hither without delay.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of our affairs in Canada, as reported by the honorable commi&s;&s;ioners, is truly alarming: and I am &s;orry that my opinion of the ill con&s;equences re&s;ulting from the &s;hort enli&s;tment of the army &s;hould be but too well confirmed by the experience they have had of the want of di&s;cipline and order
<PB N="129" REF="031423_0128_0FEC4BC25ED599B8">
in our &s;oldiery there. This induces me again to wi&s;h Congre&s;s to determine on a liberal allowance to engage the troops already in &s;ervice, to re-inli&s;t for a longer period, or during the continu|ance of the war; nor can I forbear expre&s;&s;ing my opinion of the propriety of keeping the military che&s;t always &s;upplied with money, as evils of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting nature are often produced for want of a regular payment of troops.&mdash;The neglect makes them impatient and unea&s;y.</P>
<P>I am much &s;urpri&s;ed at the &s;carcity of provi&s;ions there, parti|cularly of flour; as, from &s;everal accounts I had received from thence, I was led to expect that con&s;iderable &s;upplies of that article could be procured there. That our misfortunes may not become greater, I have wrote to the commi&s;&s;ary to forward more provi&s;ions, in addition to tho&s;e already &s;ent.</P>
<P>An adjutant and quarter-ma&s;ter-general are indi&s;pen&s;ably ne|ce&s;&s;ary, with a&s;&s;i&s;tants. The money &s;aved to the continent by their non-appointment will be but &s;mall and trifling, when put in competition with the lo&s;s for want of them. Colonel Fleming who acted in the former capacity under general Mont|gomery, is now here: but his indi&s;po&s;ition is &s;uch as to render him unfit, at this time, for the po&s;t:&mdash;it is an important one, and requires vigor and activity to di&s;charge the duties of it. He will be of much &s;ervice to colonel Reed, the bu&s;ine&s;s of who&s;e office will increa&s;e con&s;iderably by the augmentation of the army.</P>
<P>It will be nece&s;&s;ary, too, that the commi&s;&s;aries in Canada, and the deputy quarter-ma&s;ter-generals, &s;hould have &s;everal a&s;&s;i&s;tants and clerks: nor do I think a preci&s;e number can be fixed on, as a variety of circum&s;tances may and mu&s;t occur, to render the number, e&s;&s;ential for doing the bu&s;ine&s;s in tho&s;e departments, greater or le&s;s at different times. It will be better, I apprehend, to leave it indefinite, and with power to the commanding officer to allow &s;uch as may be wanted.</P>
<P>I am &s;till in the dark, how the unfortunate affair ended at the Cedars, or on what terms the &s;urrender was made, as the la&s;t let|ter from the commi&s;&s;ioners has reference to a former, and mentions an agreement entered into, which I have not &s;een: but I know of it more than I could wi&s;h.</P>
<P>I have received from Providence, in con&s;equence of Mr. Mor|ris's order, as chairman of the &s;ecret committee of Congre&s;s, two hundred and thirty-four mu&s;kets, in part of the two hundred and forty-four directed to be &s;ent. The inclo&s;ed copy of a letter from Mr. Brown, will account for the deficiency.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="031423_0129_0FEC4BC4D5355A10">
I &s;hall be much obliged by your ordering a quantity of lead and flints to be immediately forwarded; our demands for both are and will be very pre&s;&s;ing.

<P>As general Woo&s;ter in all probability, will be here in a little time, in compliance with the re&s;olve of Congre&s;s and my order tran&s;mitted to him, I wi&s;h to know what I am to do with him when he comes.</P>
<P>General Schuyler in his letter of the thirty-fir&s;t ultimo, of which I tran&s;mitted you a copy ye&s;terday, mentions that &s;undry per&s;ons had a de&s;ign to &s;eize him as a tory, and probably &s;till have; and wi&s;hes Congre&s;s to give him &s;ome public mark of their approbation, if they are convinced of his zeal and attachment to the cau&s;e of his country.&mdash;Whether he intended that I &s;hould communicate his de&s;ire to them, or not, I am not certain; but, &s;uppo&s;ing that he did, I mu&s;t beg leave to reque&s;t that you will lay the paragraph before them, that they may do, in the in|&s;tance of his requi&s;ition, whatever they may judge nece&s;&s;ary.&mdash;</P>

<P>SINCE I did my&s;elf the honor of writing to you ye&s;ter|day, I have had the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing, and for a few minutes conver&s;ing with, Mr. Cha&s;e and Mr. Carroll from Canada.&mdash;Their account of our troops and the &s;ituation of affairs in that department cannot po&s;&s;ibly &s;urpri&s;e you more than it has done me. But I need not touch upon a &s;ubject which you will be &s;o well informed of from the fountain-head; nor &s;hould I have given you the trouble of a letter by this day's po&s;t, but for the di&s;traction which &s;eems to prevail in the commi&s;&s;ary's depart|ment, as well as others in that quarter,&mdash;the nece&s;&s;ity of having it under one general direction,&mdash;and the di&s;&s;atisfaction of colo|nel Trumbull at the allowance made him by Congre&s;s as an
<PB N="131" REF="031423_0130_0FEC4BC9381F2C18">
equivalent for his trouble. With re&s;pect to this particular matter, I can only &s;ay that I think he is a man well [<HI>calculated</HI>] for the bu&s;ine&s;s, and that, where a &s;hilling is &s;aved in the pay, a pound may be lo&s;t by mi&s;management in the off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ce; and that his re&s;ig|nation at this time (I mean this campaign) may po&s;&s;ibly be atten|ded with fatal con&s;equences. I therefore humbly &s;ubmit to Con|gre&s;s the propriety of hand&s;omely rewarding tho&s;e gentlemen who hold &s;uch very important, trouble&s;ome, and hazardous offices, as commi&s;&s;ary and quarter-ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>In &s;peaking to the former about the &s;upplies nece&s;&s;ary for the troops to be rai&s;ed, he informed me that the quantity of &s;alt pro|vi&s;ions which was &s;hipping from hence, might render his attempts to do it precarious; in con&s;equence of which, I de&s;ired him to lay the matter before the convention of this colony, which he will do this day, but in the mean while de&s;ired Congre&s;s might be in|formed of the matter, which I cannot better do than his own words inclo&s;ed, and &s;ubmit the con&s;ideration of it to the wi&s;dom of that honorable body.</P>
<P>To Congre&s;s I al&s;o &s;ubmit the propriety of keeping the two continental battalions (under the command of colonels Shee and M'Gaw) at Philadelphia, when there is the greate&s;t pro|bability of a &s;peedy attack upon this place, from the king's troops. The encouragements given by governor Tryon to the di&s;affected, which are circulated, no one can well tell how,&mdash;the movements of the&s;e kind of people, which are more ea&s;y to perceive than de&s;cribe,&mdash;the confident report, which is &s;aid to have come immediately from governor Tryon, and brought by a frigate from Halifax, that the troops at that place are em|barking for this,&mdash;added to a thou&s;and incidental circum&s;tances, trivial in them&s;elves, but &s;trong from compari&s;on,&mdash;leaves not a doubt upon my mind but that troops are hourly expected at the Hook.</P>
<P>I had no doubt, when I left this city for Philadelphia, but that &s;ome mea&s;ures would have been taken to &s;ecure the &s;u&s;|pected and dangerous per&s;ons of this government before now, and left orders for the military to give every aid to the civil power. But the &s;ubject is delicate, and nothing is done in it. We may therefore have internal as well as external enemies to contend with.</P>

<P>I HAVE the honor of tran&s;mitting to Congre&s;s a letter which came by expre&s;s la&s;t night from general Schuyler, inclo&s;|ing a copy of a letter to him from colonel Kirkland. I have likewi&s;e inclo&s;ed the copy of one directed to general Putnam or the commanding officer at New-York. The repre&s;entations contained in the&s;e letters have induced me, without waiting the determination of Congre&s;s, to direct general Schuyler immediate|ly to commence a treaty with the Six Nations, and to engage them in our intere&s;t, upon the be&s;t terms he and his colleagues in com|mi&s;&s;ion can procure; and I tru&s;t the urgency of the occa&s;ion will ju&s;tify my proceedings to the Congre&s;s:&mdash;the nece&s;&s;ity for deci&s;i|on and di&s;patch in all our mea&s;ures, in my opinion, becomes every day more and more apparent.</P>
<P>The expre&s;s, Mr. Bennet, was overtaken at Albany by ge|neral Schuyler, who had received intelligence at Fort-George that a con&s;iderable body of Mohawk Indians were coming down the Mohawk river under the conduct of &s;ir John John|&s;ton. The general's extreme hurry would not allow him to write: but it &s;eems his intention is to collect at Albany a &s;uffi|cient force to oppo&s;e &s;ir John. I have given him my opinion that colonel Dayton's regiment &s;hould be employed in that &s;er|vice, and to &s;ecure the po&s;t where Fort-Stanwix formerly &s;tood.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of an information that &s;everal merchants were exporting &s;alt pork and beef from this place, I reque&s;ted the commi&s;&s;ary to make application to the provincial Congre&s;s for a re&s;traint to be laid on the exportation of tho&s;e articles, as I apprehended, not only that the enemy might receive &s;upplies by the capture of our ve&s;&s;els, but that our people might &s;hortly experience a &s;carcity. The provincial Congre&s;s have accord|ingly made a re&s;olution (a copy of which is inclo&s;ed) to &s;top the exportation for fourteen days. They expect Congre&s;s will in the mean time frame &s;ome general regulations on this head. They are unwilling (they &s;ay) to &s;ubject their con&s;tituents to par|tial re&s;traints.</P>
<P>I once mentioned to Congre&s;s that I thought a war-office, ex|tremely nece&s;&s;ary; and they &s;eemed inclined to in&s;titute one for our army: but the affair &s;eems to be &s;ince dropped. Give me leave again to in&s;i&s;t on the utility and importance of &s;uch and e&s;tab|li&s;hment. The more I reflect upon the &s;ubject, the more I am convinced of its nece&s;&s;ity, and that affairs can never be proper|ly conducted without it.</P>

<P>I Herewith tran&s;mit you copies of a letter from general Schuyler and its &s;everal inclo&s;ures, which I received &s;ince I had the honor of addre&s;&s;ing you ye&s;terday. From the&s;e you will learn that general Thomas died the &s;econd in&s;tant; and the apprehen&s;i|ons of our frontier friends in this colony, that our &s;avage foes are meditating an attack again&s;t them.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t beg leave to refer you to a paragraph in the copy of general Schuyler's letter to general Putnam or the command|ing officers here, inclo&s;ed in mine of the thirteenth, where he reque&s;ts a &s;upply of cloathing to be &s;ent for the army in Canada. As there is but little or no probability of getting it here, I &s;hall be glad to know whether there will be any chance of pro|curing it in Philadelphia; and, if it &s;hould be &s;ent through the hands of the quarter-ma&s;ter here, to what account it is to be charged.</P>
<P>I was la&s;t evening favored with yours of the eleventh in&s;tant, and hope the two battalions, which Congre&s;s have ordered from Philadelphia for the defence of this place, will come provid|ed with arms. If they do not, they will be of no &s;ervice, as there are more troops here already than are armed.</P>
<P>From general Schuyler's letter, he has in view the taking po&s;t where Fort-Stanwix formerly &s;tood. I wrote him, I thought it prudent, previous to that, to &s;ecure a po&s;t lower down, about the falls below the German-Flats, le&s;t the &s;ava|ges &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of the country, and prevent &s;up|plies of men and provi&s;ions that may be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end there in future.

I have de&s;ired him to explain the

<P>I DO my&s;elf the honor to tran&s;mit to Congre&s;s a copy of a letter covering copies of other papers, which I received ye&s;|terday evening from general Sullivan. The intelligence com|municated by him is plea&s;ing and intere&s;ting, and &s;uch as mu&s;t afford the greate&s;t &s;atisfaction, if the conduct the Canadians have di&s;covered &s;ince his arrival among them is ingenious and &s;incere.</P>
<P>General Sullivan mentions his having given commi&s;&s;ions to &s;ome of the Canadians as a mea&s;ure founded in nece&s;&s;ity, and reque&s;ts my approbation of it. But not con&s;idering my&s;elf em|powered to &s;ay any thing upon the &s;ubject, it may not be im|proper for Congre&s;s to give him their opinion in this in&s;tance.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o inclo&s;ed copies of General Schuyler's letters re|ceived at the &s;ame time. They contain accounts re&s;pecting the Indians, variant from what was reported by Mr. Kirkland, but amounting to the &s;ame thing,&mdash;the probability of the &s;avages at|tacking our frontiers.</P>
<P>By la&s;t night's po&s;t I had information of a capture made by our armed ve&s;&s;els, of one of the tran&s;ports with a company of High|landers on board, bound to Bo&s;ton. The inclo&s;ed extract from general Ward's letter to me will give you the intelligence more particularly.&mdash;There are accounts in the city, mentioning other valuable prizes: but as general Ward has &s;aid nothing of them, I fear they want authenticity.</P>
<P>I beg leave to mention that a further &s;um of money will be wanted for our military che&s;t by the time it can be &s;ent. The in|clo&s;ed note from the payma&s;ter-general &s;hews the nece&s;&s;ity for it; and, I may add, be&s;ides his e&s;timates of draughts to be made, there are the claims of the ea&s;tern troops at Bo&s;ton, for three or four month's pay, not included, and now due.</P>
<P>Colonel Magaw is arrived with part of his battalion; and by wedne&s;day evening the whole, both of his and colonel Shee's will be here, as I am told.</P>
<P>As it is and may be of great importance to have a communi|cation
<PB N="135" REF="031423_0134_0FEC4BD162F9E738">
with the Jer&s;eys and Long-I&s;land, I have had &s;everal flat-bottomed boats built for the purpo&s;e, and have thoughts of getting more for Po&s;aic and Hickin&s;ac rivers where they may be equally nece&s;&s;ary for tran&s;porting our army or part of it occa&s;ionally, or &s;uccours coming to or going from it.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM now to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of the fourteenth and eighteenth in&s;tant, and the intere&s;ting re&s;olves con|tained in them, with which I have been honored. The &s;everal matters recommended to my attention &s;hall be particularly regard|ed, and the directions of Congre&s;s and your reque&s;ts complied with in every in&s;tance, as far as in my power.</P>
<P>The in&s;tituting a war-office is certainly an event of great im|portance, and, in all probability, will be recorded as &s;uch in the hi&s;toric page. The benefits derived from it, I flatter my&s;elf, will be con&s;iderable, though the plan upon which it is fir&s;t formed may not be entirely perfect. This, like other great works, in its fir&s;t edition, may not be free from error:&mdash;time will di&s;cover its defects, and experience &s;ugge&s;t the remedy, and &s;uch further improvements as may be nece&s;&s;ary; but it was right to give it a beginning, in my opinion.</P>
<P>The recommendation to the convention of New-York for re|&s;training and puni&s;hing di&s;affected per&s;ons, I am hopeful, will be attended with &s;alutary con&s;equences; and the prohibition again&s;t exporting provi&s;ions appears to have been a mea&s;ure founded in &s;ound policy, le&s;t proper &s;upplies &s;hould be wanted, wherewith to &s;upply our armies.</P>
<P>I have tran&s;mitted general Schuyler the re&s;olves about the
<PB N="136" REF="031423_0135_0FEC4BD5B0C2BA20">
Indians, and the others on which he is to act; and have reque&s;ted his &s;trict attention and exertions in order to their being carried in|to execution with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch.</P>
<P>I note your reque&s;t re&s;pecting Mr. Hancock. He &s;hall have &s;uch directions as may be nece&s;&s;ary for conducting his office; and I am happy he will have &s;o early a remittance for paying the troops in his department.</P>
<P>The &s;ilver and paper money de&s;igned for Canada will be highly &s;erviceable, and I hope will be the means of re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hing our credit there in &s;ome degree with the Canadians, and al&s;o encourage our men too, who have complained in this in&s;tance. When it arrives, I will &s;end it forward under a proper guard.</P>
<P>I have communicated to major-general Gates the re&s;olve of Congre&s;s for him to prepare to Canada, and directed him to view Point-au-fer, that a fortre&s;s may be erected if he &s;hall judge ne|ce&s;&s;ary. He is preparing for his command, and in a few days will take his departure for it. I would fain hope his arrival there will give our affairs a complection different from what they have worn for a long time pa&s;t, and that many e&s;&s;ential benefits will re&s;ult from it.</P>
<P>The kind attention Congre&s;s have &s;hewn to afford the com|mander-in-chief here every a&s;&s;i&s;tance, by re&s;olving that recom|mendatory letters be written to the conventions of New-Jer&s;ey, New-York, and a&s;&s;embly of Connecticut, to authori&s;e him to call in the militia in ca&s;e of exigency, claims my thankful acknow|ledgments; and, I tru&s;t, if carried into execution, will produce many advantages in ca&s;e it may be expedient at any time to call in early reinforcements. The delays incident to the ordinary mode may frequently render their aid too late, and prove exceedingly injurious.</P>
<P>I this evening received intelligence of the nineteenth in&s;tant from captain Pond of the armed &s;loop Schuyler, of his having taken, about fifty miles from this, on the &s;outh &s;ide of Long-I&s;land, a &s;hip and a &s;loop bound to Sandy-Hook. The &s;hip from Gla&s;gow, with a company of the forty-&s;econd regiment, had been taken by one of commodore Hopkins's fleet, who took the &s;oldiers out, and ordered her to Rhode-I&s;land; after which, &s;he was retaken by the Cerberus, and put under the convoy of the &s;loop. As captain Pond informs me, there were five commi&s;&s;ioned officers, two ladies, and four privates on board. They are not yet arrived at head-quarters.&mdash;Inclo&s;ed is an invoice of what they have on board.</P>
<P>General Woo&s;ter having expre&s;&s;ed an inclination and wi&s;h to
<PB N="137" REF="031423_0136_0FEC4BD7864A3EA8">
wait on Congre&s;s, I have given him permi&s;&s;ion, not having any occa&s;ion for him here. He &s;et out this morning.</P>
<P>I have been up to view the grounds about King&s;bridge, and find them to admit of &s;everal places well calculated for de|fence; and, e&s;teeming it a pa&s;s of the utmo&s;t importance, have ordered works to be laid out, and &s;hall direct part of the two battalions from Penn&s;ylvania to &s;et about the execution imme|diately, and will add to their number &s;everal of the milita when they come in, to expedite them with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch.</P>
<P>Their con&s;equence, as they will keep open the communica|tion with the country, requires the mo&s;t &s;peedy completion of them.</P>

<P>I WAS this morning honored with your favur of the nine|teenth in&s;tant, with &s;undry re&s;olves of Congre&s;s, which came to hand after I had clo&s;ed mine of the twentieth. I &s;hall ap|point a deputy mu&s;ter-ma&s;ter-general as &s;oon as I can fix on a proper per&s;on for the office, and direct him immediately to re|pair to Canada.</P>
<P>Mr. Bennet, the bearer of this, delivered me a letter to-day from general Schuyler, inclo&s;ing the proceedings of the commi&s;|&s;ioners of Indian affairs, at a meeting at Albany, in con&s;equence of the re&s;olution of Congre&s;s (as they &s;ay) which I tran&s;|mitted, the &s;eventh in&s;tant, for engaging the Indians in our &s;ervice. The gentlemen appear to me to have widely mi&s;taken the views of Congre&s;s in this in&s;tance, and to have formed a plan for engaging &s;uch Indians as were not in contemplation.&mdash;I cannot account upon what principle they have gone, as a part of their proceedings &s;hews they are about to hold a conference with the Six Nations. I &s;uppo&s;e they e&s;teemed what they have done, a nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ure;&mdash;a copy of which I have the honor to inclo&s;e you.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now beg leave to lay before Congre&s;s a prepo&s;ition made to me by captain Leary of this city, in behalf of a body of men who are de&s;irous of being employed in the continental &s;ervice, as a troop of hor&s;e, and at the &s;ame time to offer my opinion that &s;uch a corps may be extremely u&s;eful in many re|&s;pects. In a march, they may be of the utmo&s;t &s;ervice in re|connoitring the enemy and gaining intelligence, and have it in their power to render many important benefits. The terms on
<PB N="138" REF="031423_0137_0FEC59D75EBB89D8">
which they are willing to engage are inclo&s;ed, which appear to me moderate and rea&s;onable.&mdash;I am al&s;o informed that another company might readily be made up, and mo&s;t probably upon the &s;ame terms. I would therefore &s;ubmit the propriety and expediency of the mea&s;ure to the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s, and wi&s;h their opinion whether it will be agreeable to them that both or either of them &s;hould be formed and incorporated in this army, in manner as has been propo&s;ed by captain Leary, if it can be done.</P>

<P>I Herewith tran&s;mit you an extract of a letter from general Ward, which came to hand by la&s;t night's po&s;t, containing the agreeable intelligence of their having obliged the king's &s;hips to leave Nanta&s;ket road, and of two tran&s;ports more being taken by our armed ve&s;&s;els, with two hundred and ten Highland troops on board.</P>
<P>I &s;incerely wi&s;h the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s had attended our arms in another quarter:&mdash;but it has not. In Canada, the &s;ituation of our affairs is truly alarming. The inclo&s;ed copies of generals Schuyler, Sullivan, and Arnold's letters will inform you that general Thomp&s;on has met with a repul&s;e at Three Rivers, and is now a pri&s;oner in the hands of general Burgoyne, who (the&s;e accounts &s;ay) is arrived with a con&s;iderable army. Nor do they &s;eem to promi&s;e an end of our misfortunes here:&mdash;it is greatly to be feared that the next advices from thence will be, that our &s;hattered, divided and broken army (as you will &s;ee by the return) have been obliged to abandon the country, and retreat,
<PB N="139" REF="031423_0138_0FEC59DB02D5F7A8">
to avoid a greater calamity,&mdash;that of being cut off or becoming pri&s;oners.&mdash;I will have done upon the &s;ubject, and leave you to draw &s;uch conclu&s;ions as you conceive, from the &s;tate of facts, are mo&s;t likely to re&s;ult: only adding my apprehen&s;ions that one of the latter events,&mdash;either that they are cut off, or become pri&s;oners,&mdash;has already happened, if they did not retreat while they had an opportunity. General Schuyler and general Arnold &s;eem to think it extremely probable; and if it has taken place, it will not be ea&s;y to de&s;cribe all the fatal con&s;equences that may flow from it. At lea&s;t our utmo&s;t exertions will be nece&s;&s;ary, to prevent the advantages they have gained being turned to our greater misfortunes.&mdash;General Gates will certainly &s;et out to|morrow, and would have gone before now, had he not ex|pected to receive &s;ome particular in&s;tructions from Congre&s;s, which colonel Braxton &s;aid he imagined would be given and tran&s;mitted here.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed is a copy of a letter from general Arnold, re&s;pecting &s;ome of the Indian tribes, to general Schuyler, and of a talk had at Albany, with thirteen of the Oneidas. They &s;eemed then to entertain a friendly di&s;po&s;ition towards us, which I wi&s;h may not be changed by the misfortunes we have &s;u&s;tained in Ca|nada.</P>

<P>I am hopeful general Sullivan would retreat from I&s;le-aux|noix without waiting for previous orders for that purpo&s;e; as from general Schuyler's and Arnold's letters, it is much to be feared, by remaining there any con&s;iderable time, his retreat would be cut off, or at lea&s;t be a matter of extreme difficulty. I would ob&s;erve to Congre&s;s that it is not in my power to &s;end any carpenters from hence to build the gondolas and gallies general Arnold mentions, without taking them from a work equally nece&s;&s;ary (if not more &s;o) here, of the &s;ame kind:&mdash;and &s;ubmit it to them whether it may not be advi&s;able (as it is

<P>I have the plea&s;ure to inform you of another capture made by our armed ve&s;&s;els, of a tran&s;port, on the nineteenth in&s;tant, with a company of Highland grenadiers on board.

<P>The quarter-ma&s;ter-general has been called upon for &s;topping the tents de&s;igned for Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, and ordered to forward them immediately. He means to write to Congre&s;s upon the &s;ubject, and hopes his conduct will not appear to de&s;erve their reprehen&s;ion. Of this they will judge from his relation of the matter.</P>
<P>Being extremely de&s;irous to forward the intelligence from Ca|nada to Congre&s;s, well knowing their anxiety about our affairs there, I mu&s;t defer writing upon &s;ome other matters, I want to lay before them, until the next opportunity, which I hope will be to-morrow, when I will inform them fully upon the &s;ubject of ra|tions, having de&s;ired the commi&s;&s;ary-general to furni&s;h me with &s;ome things nece&s;&s;ary in that in&s;tance.</P>

<P>UPON information that major * * * was travelling through the country under &s;u&s;picious circum&s;tances, I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to have him &s;ecured, I therefore &s;ent after him, he was taken at South-Amboy, and brought up to New-York.

New-Wind&s;or, and was taken &s;o far out of his proper and direct route to Philadelphia, this con&s;ideration added to the length of time he had taken to perform his journey,&mdash;his being found in &s;o &s;u&s;picious a place as Amboy,&mdash;his unnece&s;&s;ary &s;tay there on pre|tence of getting &s;ome baggage from New-York, and an expectation of receiving money from a per&s;on here, of bad character, and in no circum&s;tances to furni&s;h him out of his own &s;tock,&mdash;the major's re|putation, and his being a half pay officer,&mdash;have increa&s;ed my jealou&s;ies about him.</P>

<P>IN compliance of the reque&s;t of Congre&s;s contained in your favor of the twenty-fifth in&s;tant, and my promi&s;e of ye&s;terday, I do my&s;elf the honor to inform you the co&s;t of a ration, according to the commi&s;&s;ary-general's e&s;timate, from the fir&s;t of July to the fir&s;t of December, will be from eight-pence to eight-pence half penny, York currency.</P>
<P>Having di&s;charged the obligation I was under in this in|&s;tance, and finding that many applications have been made for victualling the flying camp, I would, with all po&s;&s;ible defer|ence, wi&s;h Congre&s;s to con&s;ider, the matter well before they come to any determination upon it. Who the gentlemen are that have made offers upon this occa&s;ion, I know not: con&s;e|quently my objection to their appointment cannot proceed from per&s;onal di&s;like; nor have I it in view to &s;erve Mr. Trumbull the commi&s;&s;ary-general, by wi&s;hing him to have the direction of the whole &s;upplies for his emolument: becau&s;e
<PB N="142" REF="031423_0141_0FEC59E52770B9B8">
whatever rations are taken from him &s;ave him the trouble of &s;upplying provi&s;ions to the amount, without dimini&s;hing his pay,&mdash;that being fixed and certain:&mdash;but what influences me is a regard to the public good. I am morally certain, if the bu|&s;ine&s;s is taken out of Mr. Trumbull's hands and put into ano|ther's, that it may, and will in all probability, be attended with great and many inconveniencies. It is likely, during the conti|nuance of the war between us and Great Britain, that the army here, or part of it, and the troops compo&s;ing the flying camp, will be frequently joined, and under the nece&s;&s;ity of affording each other mutual aid. If this event is probable (and mo&s;t certainly it is), the &s;ame confu&s;ion and di&s;order will re&s;ult from having two commi&s;&s;aries, or one commi&s;&s;ary and one contractor in the &s;ame army in the &s;ame department, as did between Mr. Trumbull and Mr. Living&s;ton on the coming of the former to New-York. I cannot di&s;criminate the two ca&s;es; and not fore&s;eeing that any good con&s;equences will flow from the mea|&s;ure, but that many bad ones will,&mdash;&s;uch as cla&s;hing of inter|e&s;ts,&mdash;a contention for &s;tores, carriages,&mdash;and many other cau&s;es that might be mentioned if hurry of bu&s;ine&s;s would permit,&mdash;I confe&s;s I cannot perceive the propriety of appointing a different per&s;on, or any but the commi&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>I would al&s;o add, that few armies, if any, have been better &s;upplied than the troops under Mr. Trumbull's care in this in&s;tance; which, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, ought to have con&s;iderable weight, e&s;pecially as we have &s;trong rea&s;ons to believe that a large &s;hare of the misfortunes our arms have &s;u&s;tained in Cana|da, &s;prang from a want of proper and nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies of pro|vi&s;ions.</P>
<P>Mr. Trumbull too (I am informed) has already made provi|&s;ion in New-Jer&s;ey for the flying camp which will be &s;tationed there, and employed proper per&s;ons in that colony to tran&s;act the bu&s;ine&s;s incident to his department, in obedience to my orders, and in full confidence that it was to come under his ma|nagement.</P>
<P>My great de&s;ire to &s;ee the affairs of this important po&s;t, on which &s;o much depends, go on in an ea&s;y, &s;mooth and unin|terrupted cour&s;e, has led me to &s;ay thus much upon the &s;ubject, and will, I hope (if I am unhappy enough to differ in opinion with Congre&s;s), plead my excu&s;e for the liberty I have taken.</P>
<P>I would al&s;o beg leave to mention to congre&s;s the nece&s;&s;ity there is of &s;ome new regulations being entered into, re&s;pecting the chaplains of this army. They will remember that appli|cations were made to increa&s;e their pay, which was conceived
<PB N="143" REF="031423_0142_0FEC59E6B5868B90">
too low for their &s;upport; and that it was propo&s;ed (if it could not be done for the whole) that the number &s;hould be le&s;&s;ened, and one be appointed to two regiments, with an additional al|lowance. This latter expedient was adopted, and, while the army continued all together at one encampment, an&s;wered well, or at lea&s;t did not produce many inconveniences. But the ar|my now being differently circum&s;tanced from what it then was,&mdash;part here, part at Bo&s;ton, and a third part detached to Ca|nada,&mdash;has introduced much confu&s;ion and di&s;order in this in|&s;tance; nor do I know how it is po&s;&s;ible to remedy the evil, but by affixing one to each regiment, with &s;alaries competent to their &s;upport. No &s;hifting, no change from one regiment to another can an&s;wer the purpo&s;e; and in many ca&s;es it could never be done though the regiments &s;hould con&s;ent,&mdash;as where detachments are compo&s;ed of unequal numbers, or ordered from different po&s;ts. Many more inconveniencies might be pointed out: but the&s;e, it is pre&s;umed, will &s;ufficiently &s;hew the defect of the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment, and the propriety of an alteration. What that alteration &s;hall be, Congre&s;s will plea&s;e to determine.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s, I doubt not, will have heard of the plot, that was forming among many di&s;affected per&s;ons in this city and govern|ment for aiding the king's troops upon their arrival. No regu|lar plan &s;eems to have been dige&s;ted; but &s;everal per&s;ons have been enli&s;ted, and &s;worn to join them. The matter, I am in hopes, by a timely di&s;covery, will be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed and put a &s;top to. Many citizens and others, among whom is the mayor, are now in confinement. The matter has been traced up to governor Tryon; and the mayor appears to have been a principal agent, or go-between him and the per&s;ons concerned in it. The plot has been communicated to &s;ome of the army, and part of my guard engaged in it. T * * * H * * *, one of them, has been tried, and, by the unanimous opinion of a court-martial, is &s;entenced to die,&mdash;having enli&s;ted him&s;elf, and engaged others. The &s;entence, by the advice of the whole council of general officers, will be put in execution to-day at eleven o'clock. The others are not tried, I am hopeful this example will produce ma|ny &s;alutary con&s;equences, and deter others from entering into the like traitorous practices.</P>
<P>The enclo&s;ed copy of a re&s;olve of the provincial Congre&s;s will &s;hew that &s;ome of the diaffected on Long-I&s;land have taken up arms.&mdash;I have, agreeable to their reque&s;t, &s;ent a party after them, but have not as yet been able to apprehend

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS la&s;t night honored with your favor of the twenty-&s;ixth in&s;tant, and, agreeable to your reque&s;t, &s;hall pay proper atten|tion to the re&s;olves it inclo&s;ed.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve the augmentation Congre&s;s have re&s;olved to make to the forces de&s;tined to the northern department, and the bounty be allowed &s;uch &s;oldiers as will enli&s;t for three years. I hope many good con&s;equences will re&s;ult from the&s;e mea&s;ures; and that, from the latter, a con&s;iderable number of men may be induced to engage in the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>I &s;hould e&s;teem my&s;elf extremely happy to afford the lea&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Canada department in compliance with the de|&s;ire of Congre&s;s and your requi&s;ition, were it in my power: but it is not. The return which I tran&s;mitted ye&s;terday will but too well convince Congre&s;s of my incapacity in this in&s;tance, and point out to them that the force I now have is trifling, con&s;idering the many and important po&s;ts that are nece&s;&s;ary, and mu&s;t be &s;upported, if po&s;&s;ible. But few militia have yet

come in, the whole being about twelve hundred, including the two battalions of this city, and one company from the Jer&s;eys. I wi&s;h the delay may not be attended with di&s;agreeable con&s;equen|ces, and their aid may not come too late, or when it may not be wanted. I have wrote,&mdash;I have done every thing I could, to call them in: but they have not come, though I am told that they are generally willing.</P>
<P>The accounts communicated ye&s;terday through lieutenant Da|vi&s;on's letter are partly confirmed, and, I dare &s;ay, will turn out to be true on the whole. For two or three days pa&s;t, three or four &s;hips have been dropping in; and I ju&s;t now received an expre&s;s from an officer appointed to keep a look-out on Staten-I&s;land, that forty-five arrived at the Hook to-day:&mdash;&s;ome &s;ay more;&mdash;and I &s;uppo&s;e the whole fleet will be in, within a day or two. I am hopeful, before they are prepared to attack, that I &s;hall get &s;ome reinforcements.&mdash;Be this as it may, I &s;hall at|tempt to make the be&s;t di&s;po&s;ition I can of the troops, in order to give them a proper reception, and to prevent the ruin and de&s;truc|tion they are meditating again&s;t us.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the expre&s;s arrived la&s;t night, I &s;ent the letters for the northern colonies, to the quarter-ma&s;ter-general, with orders to forward them immediately.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD the plea&s;ure of receiving your favor of the twenty-ninth, early this morning, with which you have been plea&s;ed to honor me, together with the re&s;olves for a further augmentation of the army.</P>
<P>The battalions of Germans, which Congre&s;s have ordered to be rai&s;ed, will be a corps of much &s;ervice: and I am hopeful that &s;uch per&s;ons will be appointed officers, as will complete their en|li&s;tments with all po&s;&s;ible expedition.</P>
<P>I &s;hall communicate to colonel Steren&s;on and one of his field-officers what you have reque&s;ted, and direct them to repair immediately to Philadelphia. It is an unlucky circum&s;tance that the term of enli&s;tment of the&s;e three companies, and of the
<PB N="146" REF="031423_0145_0FEC479270E14288">
rifle battalion, &s;hould expire at this time, when a hot campaign is, in all probability, about to commence.</P>
<P>Canada, it is certain, would have been an important acqui&s;i|tion, and well worth the expen&s;es incurred in the pur&s;uit of it. But as we could not reduce it to our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the retreat of our army with &s;o little lo&s;s, under &s;uch a variety of di&s;tre&s;|&s;es, mu&s;t be e&s;teemed a mo&s;t fortunate event. It is true, the ac|counts we have received, do not fully authori&s;e us to &s;ay that we have &s;u&s;tained no lo&s;s: but they hold forth a probable ground for &s;uch conclu&s;ion.&mdash;I am anxious to hear it confirm|ed.</P>
<P>I have the honor of tran&s;mitting you an extract of a letter received la&s;t night from general Ward.&mdash;If the &s;cheme the privateers had in view, and the mea&s;ures he had planned, have been carried into execution, the Highland corps will be tolerably well di&s;po&s;ed of: but I fear the fortunate event has not taken place.</P>
<P>In general Ward's letter, was inclo&s;ed one from lieutenant-col|onel Campbell, who was made pri&s;oner with the Highland troops. I have tran&s;mitted you a copy. This will give you a full and ex|act account of the number of pri&s;oners that were on Board the four tran&s;ports; and will prove, beyond a po&s;&s;ibility of doubt, that the evacuation of Bo&s;ton by the Briti&s;h troops was a matter neither known nor expected when he received his orders. Indeed &s;o ma|ny facts had concurred before to &s;ettle the matter, that no additi|onal proofs were nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>When I had the honor of addre&s;&s;ing you ye&s;terday, I had only been informed of the arrival of forty-five of the fleet in the morning. Since that, I have received authentic intelli|gence from &s;undry per&s;ons (among them, from general Greene) that a hundred and ten &s;ail came in before night, that were count|ed, and that more were &s;een about du&s;k in the offing&mdash;I have no doubt but the whole that &s;ailed from Halifax are now at the Hook.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as I was about to conclude my letter, I received one from a gentleman upon the &s;ubject of calling the five regiments from Bo&s;ton to the defence of Canada or New-York, and to have militia rai&s;ed in their lieu.&mdash;I have &s;ent you a copy, and &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that I know the author well; his hand-writing is quite familiar to me: he is a member of the general court, very &s;en&s;ible, of great influence, and a warm and zealous friend to the cau&s;e of America.&mdash;The expedient propo&s;ed by him is &s;ubmit|ted to Congre&s;s.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I had the honor of addre&s;&s;ing you, and on the &s;ame day, &s;everal &s;hips more arrived within the Hook, making the number that came in then a hundred and ten; and there remains no doubt of the whole of the fleet from Halifax being now here. Ye&s;terday evening fifty of them came up the bay, and anchored on the Staten-I&s;land &s;ide. Their views I cannot preci&s;ely determine; but am extremely apprehen&s;ive, as part of them only came, that they mean to &s;urround the i&s;land, and &s;e|cure the &s;tock upon it. I had con&s;ulted with a committee of the provincial Congre&s;s upon the &s;ubject, before the arrival of the fleet; and they appointed a per&s;on to &s;uperintend the bu&s;iue&s;s, and to drive the &s;tock off. I al&s;o wrote to brigadier-general Heard, and directed him to the mea&s;ure, le&s;t it might be neglected; but am fearful it has not been effected.</P>
<P>Our reinforcement of militia is yet but &s;mall:&mdash;I cannot a&s;|certain the amount, not having got a return. However, I tru&s;t, if the enemy make an attack, they will meet with a repul&s;e, as I have the plea&s;ure to inform you that an agreeable &s;pirit and willingne&s;s for action &s;eem to animate and pervade the whole of our troops.</P>
<P>As it is difficult to determine what objects the enemy may have in contemplation, and whether they may not detach &s;ome part of their force to Amboy, and to ravage that part of the country, if not extend their views farther, I &s;ubmit it to Con|gre&s;s whether it may not be expedient for them to repeat and pre&s;s home their reque&s;ts to the different governments that are to provide men for the flying camp, to furni&s;h their quotas with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch. It is a matter of great importance, and will be of &s;erious con&s;equence, to have the camp e&s;tabli&s;hed in ca&s;e the enemy &s;hould be able to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of this river, and cut off the &s;upplies of troops that might be nece&s;&s;ary on certain emer|gencies to be &s;ent from hence.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t entreat your attention to an application I made &s;ome time ago, for flints. We are extremely deficient in this nece&s;&s;ary arti|cle, and &s;hall be greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed if we cannot obtain a &s;upply. Of lead we have a &s;ufficient quantity for the whole campaign, taken off the hou&s;es here.</P>
<P>E&s;timating it of infinite advantage to prevent the enemy from getting fre&s;h provi&s;ions, and hor&s;es for their waggons, ar|tillery, &amp;c. I gave orders to a party of our men on Staten-I&s;|land (&s;ince writing to general Heard) to drive the &s;tock off, without waiting for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance or direction of the commit|tees

He adds that he was credibly told la&s;t night by a party of the militia coming to this place, that ye&s;|&s;terday they &s;aw a good deal of &s;tock driving off the i&s;land, and cro&s;&s;ing to the Jer&s;eys.&mdash;If the bu&s;ine&s;s is not executed before now, it will be impo&s;&s;ible to do it.</P>

<P>This will be handed you by colonel Steven&s;on, whom I have ordered, with the captains of the two rifle companies from Maryland, to wait on Congre&s;s.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I had the honor to addre&s;s you on the thirtieth ultimo, I tran&s;mited a copy of a letter I had received from a gentleman, a member of the honorable general court [<HI>of Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts</HI>] &s;ugge&s;ting the improbability of &s;uccours coming from thence in any rea&s;onable time, either for the defence of this place, or to reinforce our troops engaged in the Canada expedition. I am &s;orry to inform you, that from a variety of intelligence, his apprehen&s;ions appear to be ju&s;t, and to be fully confirmed: nor have I rea&s;on to expect but that the &s;upplies from the other two governments, Connecticut and New-Hamp|&s;hire,
<PB N="149" REF="031423_0148_0FEC59F9A95D91B0">
will be extremely &s;low and greatly deficient in num|ber.</P>
<P>As it now &s;eems beyond que&s;tion, and clear to demon&s;trati|on, that the enemy mean to direct their operations and bend their mo&s;t vigorous efforts again&s;t this colony, and will attempt to unite their two armies, that under general Burgoyne, and the one arrived here,&mdash;I cannot but think the expedient pro|po&s;ed by that gentleman is excedingly ju&s;t; and that the conti|nental regiments, now in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, &s;hould be im|mediately called from thence, and be employed where there is the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;on to believe their aid will be indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;a|ry. The expediency of the mea&s;ure I &s;hall &s;ubmit to the con&s;ide|ratation of Congre&s;s, and will only ob&s;erve, as my opinion, that there is not the mo&s;t di&s;tant pro&s;pect of an attempt being made, where they now are, by the enemy; and, if there &s;hould, that the militia that can be a&s;&s;embled upon the &s;horte&s;t notice will be more than equal to repel it. They are well armed, re&s;olute, and determined, and will in&s;tantly oppo&s;e any inva&s;ion that may be made in their own colony.</P>
<P>I &s;hall al&s;o take the liberty again to reque&s;t Congre&s;s to intere&s;t them&s;elves in having the militia rai&s;ed, and forwarded with all po&s;&s;ible expedition, as fa&s;t as any con&s;iderable number of them can be collected, that are to compo&s;e the flying camp. This I men|tioned in my letter ye&s;terday but think proper to repeat it, being more and more convinced of the nece&s;&s;ity. The camp will be in the neighborhood of Amboy: and I &s;hall be glad that the conventions, or committees of &s;afety, of tho&s;e governments from whence they come, may be reque&s;ted to give me previous notice of their march|ing, that I may form &s;ome plan, and direct provi&s;ion to be made for their reception.</P>
<P>The di&s;affection of the people at that place and others not far di&s;tant, is exceedingly great; and, unle&s;s it is checked and overawed, it mu&s;t become more general, and be very alarming. The arrival of the enemy will encourage it. They, or at lea&s;t a part of them, are already landed on Staten-I&s;land which is quite contiguous; and about four thou&s;and were marching a|bout it ye&s;terday, as I have been advi&s;ed, and are leaving no arts un-e&s;&s;ayed to gain the inhabitants to their &s;ide, who &s;eem but too favorably di&s;po&s;ed. It is not unlikely that in a little time they may attempt to cro&s;s to the Jer&s;ey &s;ide, and induce many to join them either from motives of intere&s;t or fear, unle&s;s there is a force to oppo&s;e them.</P>
<P>As we are fully convinced that the mini&s;terial army we &s;hall have to oppo&s;e this campaign, will be great and numerous, and
<PB N="150" REF="031423_0149_0FEC59FB4CDB7548">
well know that the utmo&s;t indu&s;try will be u&s;ed, as it already has been to excite the &s;avages and every body of people to arms again&s;t us whom they can influence, it certainly behoves us to &s;train every nerve to counteract their de&s;igns. I would therefore &s;ubmit it to Congre&s;s whether, (e&s;pecially as our &s;chemes for employing the we&s;tern Indians do not &s;eem to be attended with any great pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, from general Schuy|ler's accounts) it may not be advi&s;eable to take mea&s;ures to en|gage tho&s;e of the ea&s;tward, the St. Johns, Nova-Scotia, Pe|nob&s;cot, &amp;c. in our favor. I have been told that &s;everal might be got, perhaps five or &s;ix hundred or more, readily to join us. If they can, I &s;hould imagine it ought to be done. It will pre|vent our enemies from &s;ecuring their friend&s;hip; and further they will be of infinite &s;ervice in annoying and harra&s;&s;ing them, &s;hould they ever attempt to penetrate the country. Congre&s;s will be plea&s;ed to con&s;ider the mea&s;ure: and if they determine to adopt it, I conceive it will be nece&s;&s;ary to authori&s;e and re|que&s;t the general court of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay to carry it into execution. Their &s;ituation and advantages will enable them to ne|gotiate a treaty and an alliance better than it can be done by any per&s;on el&s;e.</P>
<P>I have been honored with your two favors of the fir&s;t in&s;tant; and, agreeable to the wi&s;hes of Congre&s;s, &s;hall put mon&s;ieur Wiebert in the be&s;t place I can to prove his abilities in the art he profe&s;&s;es. I &s;hall &s;end him up immediately to the works erecting towards King&s;bridge, under the direction of general Mifflin, whom I &s;hall reque&s;t to employ him.</P>
<P>I this moment received a letter from general Greene, an extract of which I have inclo&s;ed. The intelligence it contains is of the mo&s;t important nature, and evinces the nece&s;&s;ity of the mo&s;t &s;pirited and vigorous exertions on our part.</P>
<P>The expectation of the fleet under admiral Howe is certainly the rea&s;on the army already come have not begun their ho&s;tile operations. When that arrives, we may look for the mo&s;t in|tere&s;ting events, and &s;uch as, in all probability, will have con&s;i|derable weight in the pre&s;ent conte&s;t. It behoves us to be prepar|ed in the be&s;t manner: and I &s;ubmit it again to Congre&s;s, whe|ther the accounts given by their pri&s;oners do not &s;hew the proprie|ty of calling the &s;everal continental regiments from the Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts government, rai&s;ing the flying camp with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch, and engaging the ea&s;tern Indians.</P>
<P><HI>July 5.</HI>&mdash;General Mercer arrived here on tue&s;day, and the next morning was ordered to Paulus-Hook, to make &s;ome arrangements of the militia as they come in, and the be&s;t di&s;|po&s;ition

Town and Newark has &s;ince induced me, upon their application, to give up all the militia from the Jer&s;eys, except tho&s;e engaged for &s;ix months. I am hopeful they will be able to repel any incur&s;ions that may be attempted. Generals Mercer and Living&s;ton are concerting plans for that purpo&s;e. By a letter from the latter la&s;t night, I am informed the enemy are throwing up &s;mall works at all the pa&s;&s;es on the north &s;ide of Staten I&s;land, which it is probable they mean to &s;ecure.</P>
<P>None of the Connecticut militia are yet arrived: &s;o that the reinforcement we have received is very incon&s;iderable.</P>
<P>A letter from general Schuyler, with &s;undry inclo&s;ures (of which No. 1, 2, and 3, are exact copies), this moment came to hand, and will no doubt claim, as it ought to do, the imme|diate attention of Congre&s;s. The evils which mu&s;t inevitably follow a di&s;puted command are too obvious and alarming to ad|mit a moment's delay in your deci&s;ion thereupon: and, al|though I do not pre&s;ume to advi&s;e in a matter, now, of this delicacy, yet as it appears evident that the northern army has retreated to Crown-Point, and mean to act upon the defen&s;ive only, I cannot help giving it as my opinion that one of the ma|jor-generals in that quarter would be more u&s;efully employed here, or in the flying camp, than there: for it becomes my duty to ob&s;erve, if another experienced officer is taken from hence in order to command the flying camp, that your grand army will be entirely &s;tripped of generals who have &s;een &s;ervice,&mdash;being in a manner already de&s;titute of &s;uch. My di&s;tre&s;s on this account,&mdash;the appointment of general Whitcomb to the ea&s;tern regiments,&mdash;a conviction in my own brea&s;t that no troops will be &s;ent to Bo&s;ton,&mdash;and the certainty of a number coming to this place,&mdash;occa&s;ioned by po&s;tponing, from time to time, &s;end|ing any general officer from hence to the ea&s;tward heretofore: and now I &s;hall wait the &s;entiments of Congre&s;s relative to the five regiments in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, before I do any thing in this matter.</P>
<P>The commi&s;&s;ary-general has been with me this morning, con|cerning the other matter contained in general Schuyler's letter re&s;pecting the bu&s;ine&s;s of that department. He has, I believe, (in order to remove difficulties), recalled Mr. Avery, but &s;eems to think it nece&s;&s;ary in that ca&s;e, that Mr. Living&s;ton &s;hould be left to him&s;elf, as he cannot be re&s;pon&s;ible for per|&s;ons not of his own appointment.&mdash;This matter &s;hould al&s;o be
<PB N="152" REF="031423_0151_0FEC5A06D5A8AD80">
clearly defined by Congre&s;s.&mdash;I have already giving my opinion of the nece&s;&s;ity of the&s;e matters being under one general direc|tion, in &s;o full and clear a manner, that I &s;hall not take up the time of Congre&s;s to repeat it in this place.</P>

<P>CONGRESS having re&s;olved to rai&s;e a regiment of Ger|mans to counteract the de&s;igns of our enemies, I mu&s;t beg leave to recommend to their notice John David Wilpert, now a fir&s;t lieutenant in colonel Shee's battallion, to the office of captain in &s;aid regiment. I am per&s;onally acquainted with him, and know that he joined the Virginia forces under my command in the year 1754, and continued in &s;ervice the whole war, during which he conducted him&s;elf as an active, vigilant, and brave officer. He is a German; and his merit, as a &s;oldier, entitles him much to the office he wi&s;hes for.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM now to acknowledge the receipt of your two favors of the fourth and fifth in&s;tant, which came duly to hand, with their important inclo&s;ures.</P>
<P>I perceive that Congre&s;s have been employed in deliberating <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n mea&s;utes of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting nature. It is certain that it is not with us to determine in many in&s;tances what con&s;e|quences will flow from our councils; but yet it behoves us to adopt &s;uch, as, under the &s;miles of a gracious and all-kind pro|vidence, will be mo&s;t likely to promote our happine&s;s. I tru&s;t the late deci&s;ive part they have taken is calculated for that end, and will &s;ecure us that freedom and tho&s;e priviledges, which have been and are refu&s;ed us, contrary to the voice of nature and the Briti&s;h con&s;titution. Agreeable to the reque&s;t of Con|gre&s;s, I cau&s;ed "THE DECLARATION" to be proclaim|ed before all the army under my immediate command; and have the plea&s;ure to inform them that the mea&s;ure &s;eemed to have their mo&s;t hearty a&s;&s;ent,&mdash;the expre&s;&s;ions and behavior, both of officers and men, te&s;tifying their warme&s;t approbation of it. I have tran&s;mitted a copy to general Ward at Bo&s;ton,
<PB N="153" REF="031423_0152_0FEC5A09D7495D60">
reque&s;ting him to have it proclaimed to the continental troops in that department.</P>
<P>It is with great plea&s;ure that I hear the militia from Maryland, the Delaware government, and Penn&s;ylvania, will be in mo|tion every day to form the flying camp. It is of great im|portance, and &s;hould be accompli&s;hed with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch. The readine&s;s and alacrity, with which the committee of &s;afety of Penn&s;ylvania and the other conferees have acted in order to forward the a&s;&s;ociated militia of that &s;tate to the Jer&s;eys for &s;ervice, till the men to compo&s;e the flying camp arrive, &s;trongly evidence their regard to the common cau&s;e, and that nothing on their part will be wanting to &s;upport it. I hope, and I doubt not, that the a&s;&s;ociated militia, impre&s;&s;ed with the ex|pediency of the mea&s;ure, will immediately carry it into execution, and furni&s;h in this in&s;tance a proof of the continuance of that zeal which has &s;o eminently marked their conduct. I have directed the commi&s;&s;ary to make the nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ion for their re|ception, who will al&s;o &s;upply the army for the flying camp with rations.&mdash;A proper officer will be appointed to com|mand it.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of the power given me by Congre&s;s, and the advice of my general officers, I have wrote to general Ward, and de&s;ired him forthwith to detach three of the fulle&s;t regiments from the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay to join the northern army,&mdash;e&s;|teeming it a&punc; matter of the greate&s;t importance to have a &s;uffi|cient force there to prevent the enemy pa&s;&s;ing the lake and mak|ing an impre&s;&s;ion in that quarter.&mdash;The gondolas and gallies will be of great &s;ervice; and I am hopeful the carpenters you have &s;ent from Philadelphia, and that will go from the ea&s;tward on your ap|plication, will be able to build a &s;ufficient number in time to an|&s;wer every exigency.</P>
<P>I have reque&s;ted governor Cooke, if the duck mentioned in Mr. Greene's letter is proper for tents, to have it made up as early as po&s;&s;ible and forwarded here. I have al&s;o de&s;ired him to &s;end the flints and &s;mall-arms, as I gave general Ward tho&s;e of the latter that were taken out of the Scotch tran&s;ports,&mdash;our deficiency in the&s;e nece&s;&s;ary articles being &s;till great.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erving that Congre&s;s have particularly mentioned a bounty of ten dollars to be paid to men of &s;ome corps directed to be rai&s;ed in two or three in&s;tances &s;ince their re&s;olve of the twenty-&s;ixth of June allowing &s;uch bounty, I have been led to doubt how that re&s;olve is to be con&s;trued; whether it is a general re|gulation, and extends to all men that will engage for three years,&mdash;for in&s;tance, the &s;oldiers of the pre&s;ent army, if they
<PB N="154" REF="031423_0153_0FEC5A0B8E34B030">
will enli&s;t for that time. If it is, and extends to them, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to forward a large &s;um of money:&mdash;many perhaps would engage.</P>
<P>I al&s;o ob&s;erve, by their re&s;olve of the twenty-fifth of June for rai&s;ing four regiments of militia in the ea&s;tern governments to augment the troops in the northern department, that the a&s;|&s;emblies of tho&s;e governments are empowered to appoint pay|ma&s;ters to the &s;aid regiments. This appears, to me a regulation of great u&s;e, and I could wi&s;h that it was made general, and one allowed to every regiment in the &s;ervice. Many advantages would re&s;ult from it.</P>
<P>The Connecticut militia begin to come in: but from every account the battalions will be very incomplete,&mdash;owing, they &s;ay, to the bu&s;y &s;ea&s;on of the year. That government, le&s;t any inconvenience might re&s;ult from their militia not being here in time, ordered three regiments of their light-hor&s;e to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, part of which have arrived. But, not having the means to &s;upport them (and, if it could be done, the expen&s;e would be enormous), I have thanked the gentlemen for their zeal, and the attachment they have manife&s;ted upon this occa&s;ion, and informed them that I cannot con&s;ent to their keeping their hor&s;es,&mdash;at the &s;ame time wi&s;hing them to &s;tay them|&s;elves.&mdash;I am told they or part of them mean to do &s;o.</P>
<P>General Mercer is now in the Jer&s;eys, for the purpo&s;e of receiv|ing and ordering the militia coming for the flying camp: and I have &s;ent over our chief engineer to view the ground within the neighborhood of Amboy, and to lay out &s;ome ne|ce&s;&s;ary works for the encampment, and &s;uch as may be proper at the different pa&s;&s;es in Bergen-neck, and other places on the Jer|&s;ey &s;hore oppo&s;ite Staten I&s;land, to prevent the making impre&s;&s;ions, and committing depredations on the property of the inhabit|ants.</P>
<P>The intelligence that we have from a few de&s;erters that have come over to us, and from others, is that general Howe has between nine and ten thou&s;and men, who are chiefly landed on the i&s;land, po&s;ted in different parts, and &s;ecuring the &s;everal com|munications from the Jer&s;eys with &s;mall works and intrench|ments, to prevent our people from paying them a vi&s;it;&mdash;that the i&s;landers have all joined them, &s;eem well di&s;po&s;ed to favor their cau&s;e, and have agreed to take up arms in their behalf. They look for admiral Howe's arrival every day with his fleet and a large reinforcement; are in high &s;pirits, and talk confident|ly of &s;ucce&s;s, and carrying all before them when he comes. I tru&s;t, through divine favor and our own exertions, they will
<PB N="155" REF="031423_0154_0FEC5A0D34CC1D00">
be di&s;appointed in their views; and at all events, any advan|tages they may gain will co&s;t them very dear. If our troops will behave well (which I hope will be the ca&s;e, having every thing to contend for, that freemen hold dear), they will have to wade through much blood and &s;laughter before they can car|ry any part of our works, if they carry them at all,&mdash;and, at be&s;t, be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a melancholy and mournful victory.&mdash;May the &s;acredne&s;s of our cau&s;e in&s;pire our &s;oldiery with &s;enti|ments of heroi&s;m, and lead them to the preformances of the noble&s;t exploits!</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS honored with your favor of the eighth in&s;tant by ye&s;|terday morning's po&s;t, with the &s;everal re&s;olves to which you refer|red my attention. I &s;hall duly regard them, and attempt their exe|cution as far as I am able.</P>
<P>By virtue of the di&s;cretionary power that Congre&s;s were plea&s;ed to ve&s;t me with, and by advice of &s;uch of my general officers as I have had an opportunity of con&s;ulting, I have ordered the two remaining continental regiments in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay to march immediately for the defence of this place, in full confi|dence that nothing ho&s;tile will be attempted again&s;t that &s;tate in the pre&s;ent campaign.</P>
<P>I have wrote to the general court of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, and tran&s;mitted a copy of the re&s;olve for employing the ea&s;tern Indi|ans, entreating their good offices in this in&s;tance, and their exerti|ons to have them forthwith engaged and marched to join this ar|my. I have de&s;ired five or &s;ix hundred of them to be enli&s;ted for two or three years, if they will con&s;ent to it,&mdash;&s;ubject to an ear|lier di&s;charge, if it &s;hall be thought nece&s;&s;ary,&mdash;and upon the &s;ame terms as the continental troops, if better cannot be had,&mdash;though I am hopeful they may.</P>
<P>In my letter of ye&s;terday I mentioned the arrival of part of the Connecticut light-hor&s;e to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the defence of this place, and my objection to their hor&s;es being kept. Four or five hundred of them are now come in: and, in ju&s;tice to their zeal and laudable attachment to the cau&s;e of their country, I am to inform you that they have con&s;ented to &s;tay as long as occa&s;ion may require, though they &s;hould be at the expence of maintain|ing their hor&s;es them&s;elves. They have pa&s;tured them out a|bout the neighborhood of King&s;bridge (being unwilling to &s;end
<PB N="156" REF="031423_0155_0FEC5A0EEAFE0310">
them away) at the rate of half a dollar per week each, mean|ing to leave it entirely with Congre&s;s either to allow or refu&s;e it, as they &s;hall judge proper. I promi&s;ed to make this repre|&s;entation, and thought it my duty: and will only ob&s;erve that the motives which induced them fir&s;t to &s;et out were good and prai&s;e-worthy, and were to afford the mo&s;t &s;peedy and early &s;uccour, which they apprehended would be wanted before the militia arrived. Their &s;ervices may be extremely important,&mdash;being mo&s;t of them, if not all, men of reputation and of pro|perty.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject of the inclo&s;ed copy of a letter from governor Trumbull I beg leave to &s;ubmit to the con&s;ideration of Con|gre&s;s. They will perceive from his repre&s;entation, the di&s;quieting apprehen&s;ions that have &s;eized on the minds of the people &s;ince the retreat of the northern army, and how expo&s;ed the northern frontiers of New-York and New-Hamp&s;hire are to the ravages and incur&s;ions of the Indians. How far it may be expedient to rai&s;e the battallion he conceives nece&s;&s;ary to prevent the calami|ties and di&s;tre&s;&s;es he points out, they will determine, upon what he has &s;aid, and the nece&s;&s;ity that may appear to them for the mea&s;ure;&mdash;what I have done, being only to lay the matter before them in compliance with his wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o inclo&s;ed a memorial from the &s;urgeons'-mate, &s;et|ting forth the inadequacy of their pay to their &s;ervices and main|tenance, and praying that it may be increa&s;ed. I &s;hall ob&s;erve that they have a long time complained in this in&s;tance, and that &s;ome additional allowance may not be unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>As I am truly &s;en&s;ible the time of Congre&s;s is much taken up with a variety of important matters, it is with unwillingne&s;s and pain I ever repeat a reque&s;t after having once made it, or take the liberty of enforcing any opinion of mine after it is once given; but as the e&s;tabli&s;hing of &s;ome office for auditing accounts is a matter of exceeding importance to the public in|tere&s;t I would beg leave once more to call the attention of Congre&s;s to an appointment competent to the purpo&s;e. Two motives induce me to urge the matter; fir&s;t, a conviction of the utility of the mea&s;ure;&mdash;&s;econdly, that I may &s;tand excul|pated if hereafter it &s;hould appear that money has been impro|perly expended, and nece&s;&s;aries for the army obtained upon unrea|&s;onable terms.</P>
<P>For me, who&s;e time is employed from the hour of my ri&s;ing till I retire to bed again, to go into an examination of the ac|counts of &s;uch an army as this with any degree of preci&s;ion and exactne&s;s, without neglecting other matters of equal impor|tance,
<PB N="157" REF="031423_0156_0FEC5A12DC514868">
is utterly impracticable. All that I have been able to do (and that, in fact, was doing nothing), was, when the com|mi&s;&s;ary, and quarter-ma&s;ter, and director-general of the ho&s;pi|tal (for it is to the&s;e the great advances are made) applied for warrants,&mdash;to make them at times produce a general account of their expenditures. But this an&s;wers no valuable purpo&s;e. It is the minutiae that mu&s;t be gone into,&mdash;the propriety of each charge examined,&mdash;the vouchers looked into;&mdash;and, with re|&s;pect to the commi&s;&s;ary-general, his victualling returns and ex|penditures of provi&s;ions &s;hould be compared with his purcha&s;es: otherwi&s;e a per&s;on in this department, if he was inclined to be knavi&s;h, might purcha&s;e large quantities with the public money, and &s;ell one half of it again for private emolument; and yet his accounts upon paper would appear fair, and be &s;upported with vouchers for every charge.</P>
<P>I do not urge this matter from a &s;u&s;picion of any unfair prac|tices in either of the departments before mentioned; and &s;orry &s;hould I be if this con&s;truction was put upon it,&mdash;having a high opinion of the honor and integrity of the&s;e gentlemen. But there &s;hould, neverthele&s;s, be &s;ome control as well upon their di&s;cretion as hone&s;ty:&mdash;to which may be added, that accounts become perplexed and confu&s;ed by long &s;tanding, and the er|rors therein not &s;o di&s;coverable as if they underwent an early revi&s;ion and examination. I am well appri&s;ed that a trea&s;ury-office of accounts has been re&s;olved upon, and an auditor-gene|ral for &s;ettling all public accounts; but, with all deference and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the opinion of Congre&s;s, the&s;e in&s;titutions are not calculated to prevent the inconveniencies I have mentioned; nor can they be competent to the purpo&s;es, circum&s;tanced as they are.</P>
<P>We have intelligence from a de&s;erter that came to us, that, on wedne&s;day morning, the A&s;ia, Chatham, and Greyhound men-of-war weighed anchor, and (it was &s;aid) intended to pa&s;s up the North-river above the city, to prevent the communica|tion with the Jer&s;eys. They did not attempt it, nor does he know what prevented them.&mdash;A pri&s;oner belonging to the tenth regiment, taken ye&s;terday, informs that they hourly expected admiral Howe and his fleet. He adds that a ve&s;&s;el has arrived from them, and the prevailing opinion is, that an attack will be made immediately on their arrival.</P>
<P>By a letter from general Ward, I am informed that the &s;mall-pox has broke out at Bo&s;ton, and infected &s;ome of the troops. I have wrote to him to place the invalids under an officer, to remain till they are well; and to u&s;e every po&s;&s;ible
<PB N="158" REF="031423_0157_0FEC5A150D63BFE8">
precaution to prevent the troops from thence bringing the infection. The di&s;tre&s;&s;es and calamities we have already &s;uffered by this di&s;order in one part of our army, I hope, will excite his utmo&s;t care that they may not be increa&s;ed.</P>

<P>THE de&s;ign of this is to inform Congre&s;s, that, about half after three o'clock this evening, two of the enemy's &s;hips of war, one of forty and the other of twenty guns, with three tenders, weighed anchor in the bay oppo&s;ite Staten-I&s;land, and, availing them&s;elves of a bri&s;k and favorable breeze, with a flowing tide, ran pa&s;t our batteries up the North-river, without receiving any certain damage that I could perceive, notwith|&s;tanding a heavy and ince&s;&s;ant cannonade was kept up from our &s;everal batteries here, as well as from that at Paulus-Hook. They, on their part, returned and continued the fire as they ran by.&mdash;I di&s;patched an expre&s;s to brigadier-general Mifflin at our encampment towards the upper end of the I&s;land; but have not heard whether they have got by, or received any da|mage.</P>
<P>The account tran&s;mitted by this morning's po&s;t, re&s;pecting the arrival of one of the fleet, &s;eems to be confirmed. Several &s;hips have come in to-day: among them, one this evening with a Saint-George's flag at her fore-top-ma&s;t-head, which we con|clude to be admiral Howe from the circum&s;tances of the flag, and the &s;everal and general &s;alutes that were paid. It is pro|bable they will all arrive in a day or two, and immediately begin their operations.</P>
<P>As it will be extremely nece&s;&s;ary that the flying camp &s;hould be well provided with powder and ball, and it may be imprac|ticable to &s;end &s;upplies from hence on account of our hurry and engagements (be&s;ides, the communication may be uncertain), I mu&s;t beg the attention of Congre&s;s to this matter, and reque&s;t that they will forward with all po&s;&s;ible expedition &s;uch a quan|tity of mu&s;ket-powder and lead (if balls of different &s;izes can|not be had), as will be &s;ufficient for the militia to compo&s;e that camp.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY la&s;t of friday evening, which I had the honor of ad|dre&s;&s;ing you, advi&s;ed that two of the enemy's &s;hips of war and three tenders had run above our batteries here and the works at the upper end of the I&s;land. I am now to inform you, that, ye&s;terday afternoon, receiving intelligence from general Mifflin that they had pa&s;&s;ed the Tappan-&s;ea, and were trying to pro|ceed higher up,&mdash;by advice of R. R. Living&s;ton, e&s;quire, and other gentlemen, I di&s;patched expre&s;&s;es to general Clinton of Ul&s;ter, and the committee of &s;afety for Dutche&s;s-county, to take mea&s;ures for &s;ecuring the pa&s;&s;es in the Highlands, le&s;t they might have de&s;igns of &s;eizing them, and have a force con|cealed for the purpo&s;e. I wrote the evening before to the commanding officer of the two garri&s;ons there to be vigilant and prepared again&s;t any attempts they or any di&s;affected per&s;ons might make again&s;t them, and to forward expre&s;&s;es all the way to Albany, that provi&s;ion and other ve&s;&s;els might be &s;ecured and pre|vented falling into their hands.</P>
<P>The information given general Mifflin was rather premature, as to their having gone pa&s;t the Sea.&mdash;A letter from the com|mittee of Orange-county, which come to hand this morning, &s;ays they were there ye&s;terday, and that a regiment of their militia was under arms, to prevent their landing, and making an incur|&s;ion. The me&s;&s;enger who brought it, and to whom it refers for particulars, adds that a party of them, in two or three boats, had approached the &s;hore, but were forced back by our people firing at them. Since the manoeuvre of friday, there have been no other movements in the fleet.</P>
<P>General Sullivan, in a letter of the &s;econd in&s;tant, informs me of his arrival with the army at Crown-Point, where he is fortifying and throwing up works. He adds, that he has &s;ecur|ed all the &s;tores except three cannon left at Chamblee which in part is made up by taking a fine twelve-pounder out of the lake.&mdash;The army is &s;ickly,&mdash;many with the &s;mall-pox; and he is apprehen&s;ive, the militia ordered to join them, will not e&s;|cape the infection.&mdash;An officer he had &s;ent to reconnoitre had re|ported that he &s;aw at Saint John's about a hundred and fifty tents,&mdash;twenty at Saint Roy's, and fifteen at Chamblee; and works at the fir&s;t were bu&s;ily carrying on.</P>
<P>I have inclo&s;ed a general return of the army here, which will &s;hew the whole of our &s;trength. All the detached po&s;ts are in|cluded.</P>

<P>About three o'clock this afternoon I was informed that a flag from lord Howe was coming up, and waited with two of our whale-boats, until directions &s;hould be given, I immedi|ately convened &s;uch of the general officers as were not upon other duty, who agreed in opinion that I ought not to receive any letters directed to me as a private gentleman: but if other|wi&s;e, and the officer de&s;ired to come up to deliver the letter him|&s;elf, as was &s;ugge&s;ted, he &s;hould come under a &s;afe conduct. Upon this, I directed colonel Reed to go down and manage the affair under the above general in&s;truction.</P>
<P>On his return, he informed me, that after the common civi|lities, the officer acquainted him that he had a letter from lord Howe to Mr. Wa&s;hington, which he &s;hewed under a &s;ub&s;crip|tion, "<HI>To George Wa&s;hington, e&s;quire.</HI>"&mdash;Colonel Reed repli|ed, there was no &s;uch per&s;on in the army, and that a letter in|tended for the general, could not be received under &s;uch a di|rection.&mdash;The officer expre&s;&s;ed great concern,&mdash;&s;aid it was a letter rather of a civil than military nature,&mdash;that lord Howe regretted he had not arrived &s;ooner,&mdash;that he (lord Howe) had great powers&punc;&mdash;The anxiety to have the letter received was very evident, though the officer di&s;claimed all knowledge of its contents. However, colonel Reed's in&s;tructions being po&s;itive, they parted.&mdash;After they had got &s;ome di&s;tance, the officer with the flag again put about and a&s;ked under what di|rection Mr. Wa&s;hington cho&s;e to be addre&s;&s;ed: to which colonel Reed an&s;wered, his &s;tation was well known, and that certainly they could be at no lo&s;s how to direct to him.&mdash;The officer &s;aid they knew it and lamented it; and again repeated his wi&s;h that the letter could be received.&mdash;Colonel Reed told him a proper direction would obviate all difficulties, and that this was no new matter,&mdash;this &s;ubject having been fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in the cour&s;e of la&s;t year; of which lord Howe could not be ignorant:&mdash;upon which they parted.</P>
<P>I would not upon any occa&s;ion &s;acrifice e&s;&s;entials to punc|tilio: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in this in&s;tance, the opinion of others concurring with my own, I deemed it a duty to my country and my ap|pointment,
<PB N="161" REF="031423_0160_0FEC5A20E453FCE0">
to in&s;i&s;t upon that re&s;pect, which, in any other than a public view, I would willingly have waved. Nor do I doubt, but from the &s;uppo&s;ed nature of the me&s;&s;age, and the anxiety ex|pre&s;&s;ed, they will either repeat their flag, or fall upon &s;ome mode to communicate the import and [<HI>contents</HI>] of it.</P>
<P>I have been duly honored with your two letters,&mdash;that of the tenth by Mr. Ander&s;on,&mdash;and the eleventh with its inclo&s;ures. I have directed the quarter-ma&s;ter to provide him with every thing he wants to carry his &s;cheme into execution. It is an important one, and I wi&s;h it &s;ucce&s;s; but am doubtful that it will be better in theory than practice.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;age of the &s;hips of war and tenders up the river is a mat|ter of great importance, and has excited much conjecture and &s;peculation. To me two things have occurred as leading them to this proceeding,&mdash;fir&s;t a de&s;ign to &s;eize on the narrow pa&s;&s;es on both &s;ides of the river, giving almo&s;t the only land com|munication with Albany, and of con&s;equence, with our north|ern army; for which purpo&s;e, they might have troops concealed on board, which they deemed competent of them&s;elves, as the defiles are narrow,&mdash;or; that they would be joined by many di&s;affected per&s;ons in that quarter. Others have added a probability of their having a large quantity of arms on board, to be in readine&s;s to put into the hands of the to|ries immediately on the arrival of the fleet, or rather at the time they intend to make their attack.&mdash;The &s;econd is, to cut off entirely all intercour&s;e between this and Albany, by water, and the upper country, and to prevent &s;upplies of every kind going and coming.</P>
<P>The&s;e matters are truly alarming, and of &s;uch importance, that I have wrote to the provincial congre&s;s of New-York, and recom|mended to their &s;erious con&s;ideration the adoption of every po&s;&s;ible expedient to guard again&s;t the two fir&s;t; and have &s;ugge&s;ted the propriety of their employing the militia, or &s;ome part of them, in the counties in which the&s;e defiles are, to keep the enemy from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them, till further provi&s;ion can be made; and to write to the &s;everal leading per&s;ons on our &s;ide in that quarter, to be at|tentive to all the movements of the &s;hips and the di&s;affected, in or|der to di&s;cover and fru&s;trate whatever pernicious &s;chemes they have in view.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to the &s;econd conjecture of my own, and which &s;eems to be generally adopted, I have the plea&s;ure to inform Con|gre&s;s, that, if their de&s;ign is to keep the armies from provi|&s;ion, the commi&s;&s;ary has told me upon inquiry, he has for|warded &s;upplies to Albany &s;now there, and above it) &s;ufficient

I perceive the mea&s;ures Congre&s;s have taken to expedite the rai&s;ing of the flying camp, and providing it with articles of the greate&s;t u&s;e. You will &s;ee by a po&s;t&s;cript to my letter of the fourteenth, I had wrote to the commanding officer of the Penn|&s;ylvania militia, ordering them to be marched from Trenton to Amboy, as their remaining there could not an&s;wer the lea&s;t public good. For, having con&s;ulted with &s;undry gentlemen, I was informed, if the enemy mean to direct their views to|wards Penn&s;ylvania, or penetrate the Jer&s;eys, their route will be from near Amboy, and either by way of Brun&s;wick or Bound-Brook,&mdash;the lower road from South-Amboy being through a woody, &s;andy country. Be&s;ides, they will be then able to throw in &s;uccour here, and to receive it from hence in ca&s;es of emergency.</P>
<P>The Connecticut light-hor&s;e, mentioned in my letter of the eleventh, notwith&s;tanding their then promi&s;e to continue here for the defence of this place, are now di&s;charged, and about to return home,&mdash;having peremptorily refu&s;ed all kind of fatigue, duty, or even to mount guard, claiming an exemption as troop|ers. Though their a&s;&s;i&s;tance is much needed, and might be of e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice in ca&s;e of an attack, yet I judged it advi&s;able, on their application and claim of &s;uch indulgences, to di&s;charge them; as granting them would &s;et an example to others, and might produce many ill con&s;equences. The number of men included in the la&s;t return, by this, is le&s;&s;ened about five hun|dred.</P>
<P>I la&s;t night received a letter from general Schuyler, with &s;everal inclo&s;ures, copies of which I have herewith tran&s;mit|ted. They will give Congre&s;s every information I have re|&s;pecting our northern army and the &s;ituation of our affairs in that quarter;&mdash;to which I beg leave to refer their attention.&mdash;I cannot but expre&s;s my &s;urpri&s;e at the &s;carcity of provi&s;ion which general Schuyler mentions, after what the commi&s;&s;ary a&s;&s;ured me, and which formed a part of my letter of the four|teenth. He &s;till a&s;&s;ures me of the &s;ame.&mdash;This is a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing circum&s;tance, as every article of provi&s;ion, and every thing nece&s;&s;ary for that department, can have no other now than a land|conveyence, the water-communication from hence to Albany being entirely cut off.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s will plea&s;e to con&s;ider the inclo&s;ure, No. 6, about rai&s;ing &s;ix companies out of the inhabitants about the lakes, to prevent the incur&s;ions of the Indians. The general officers, in their minutes of council have determined it a matter of much importance;&mdash;and their attention to the price of goods fur|ni&s;hed

the &s;oldiery may be extremely nece&s;&s;ary. They have com|plained much upon this head.</P>
<P>The retreat from Crown-Point &s;eems to be con&s;idered in oppo|&s;ite views by the general and field-officers.

<P>By a letter from the committee of Orange-Country, received this morning, the men-of-war and tenders were ye&s;terday at Haver&s;ham-bay, about forty miles above this.

<P>Ye&s;terday evening a flag came from general Howe, with a letter addre&s;&s;ed "<HI>To George Wa&s;hington, e&s;quire, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI>"&mdash;It was not received, upon the &s;ame principle that the one from lord Howe was refu&s;ed.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been duly honored with your favors of the &s;ixteenth and &s;eventeenth, with the &s;everal re&s;olves they contained; to the execution of which, &s;o far as &s;hall be in my power, I will pay pro|per attention.</P>
<P>In my letter of the &s;eventeenth I tran&s;mitted you a copy of one from general Schuyler, and of its &s;everal inclo&s;ures.&mdash;I confe&s;s the determination of the council of general officers on the &s;eventh, to retreat from Crown-Point, &s;urpri&s;ed me much; and the more I con&s;ider it, the more &s;triking does the impro|priety appear. The rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned again&s;t it by the field-officers, in their remon&s;trance, coincide greatly with my own ideas and tho&s;e of the other general officers I have had an op|pertunity of con&s;ulting with, and &s;eem to be of con&s;iderable weight,&mdash;I may add, conclu&s;ive.&mdash;I am not &s;o fully acquainted with the geography of that country and the &s;ituation of the different po&s;ts, as to pronounce a peremptory judgment upon the matter; but, if my ideas are right, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Crown-Point
<PB N="165" REF="031423_0164_0FEC5A2C9EE871F0">
is e&s;&s;ential, to give us the &s;uperiority and ma&s;tery upon the lake.</P>
<P>That the enemy will po&s;&s;e&s;s it as &s;oon as abandoned by us, there can be no doubt; and if they do, whatever gallies or force we keep on the lake will be unque&s;tionably in the rear.&mdash;How they are to be &s;upported there, or what &s;uccour can be drawn from them there, is beyond my comprehen&s;ion.&mdash;Perhaps it is only meant that they &s;hould be employed on the communication between that and Tyconderoga. If this is the ca&s;e, I fear the views of Con|gre&s;s will not be an&s;wered, nor the &s;alutary effects be derived from them, that were intended.</P>
<P>I have mentioned my &s;urpri&s;e to general Schuyler, and would, by the advice of the general officers here, have directed that that po&s;t &s;hould be maintained, had it not been for two cau|&s;es&mdash;an apprehen&s;ion that the works have been de&s;toyed, and that, if the army &s;hould be ordered from Tyconderoga, or the po&s;t oppo&s;ite to it (where I pre&s;ume they are), to repo&s;&s;e&s;s it, they would have neither one place nor another &s;ecure and in a defen&s;ible &s;tate:&mdash;the other, le&s;t it might increa&s;e the jealou&s;y and diver&s;ity of opinions which &s;eem already too prevalent in that army, and e&s;tabli&s;h a precedent for the inferior officers to &s;et up their judgments whenever they would, in oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e of their &s;uperiors,&mdash;a matter of great delicacy, and that might lead to fatal con&s;equences, if countenanced;&mdash;though in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance I could wi&s;h their rea&s;oning had pre|vailed.</P>
<P>If the army has not removed, what I have &s;aid to general Schuyler may perhaps bring on a re-con&s;ideration of the matter; and it may not be too late to take mea&s;ures for maintaining that po&s;t. But of this I have no hope.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the re&s;olve of Congre&s;s for three of the ea&s;tern regiments to reinforce the northern army, I wrote to general Ward, and, by advice of my general officers, directed them to march to Norwich, and there to embark for Albany; con|ceiving that two valuable purpo&s;es might re&s;ult therefrom,&mdash;fir&s;t, that they would &s;ooner join the army by pur&s;uing this route, and be &s;aved from the di&s;tre&s;s and fatigue that mu&s;t attend every long march through the country at this hot and un|comfortable &s;ea&s;on;&mdash;and &s;econdly, that they might give &s;uc|cour here, in ca&s;e the enemy &s;hould make an attack about the time of their pa&s;&s;ing. But the enemy having now, with their &s;hips of war and tenders, cut off the water-communication from hence to Albany, I have wrote this day and directed them to proceed by land acro&s;s the country.&mdash;If Congre&s;s di&s;approve

the route, or wi&s;h to give orders about them, you will plea&s;e to certify me thereof, that I may take mea&s;ures accordingly.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed I have the honor to tran&s;mit you copies of a letter and &s;undry re&s;olutions which I received ye&s;terday from the con|vention of this &s;tate. By them you will perceive they have been acting upon matters of great importance, and are exerting them&s;elves in the mo&s;t vigorous manner to defeat the wick|ed de&s;igns of the enemy, and &s;uch di&s;affected per&s;ons as may in|cline to a&s;&s;i&s;t and facilitate their views.&mdash;In compliance with their reque&s;t, and on account of the &s;carcity of money for carrying their &s;alutary views into execution, I have agreed to lend them, out of the &s;mall &s;tock now in hand (not more than &s;ixty thou&s;and dollars), twenty thou&s;and dollars, in part of what they want; which they promi&s;e &s;peedily to replace.&mdash;Had there been money &s;ufficient for paying the whole of our troops, and no more, I could not have done it. But as it was o|therwi&s;e, and by no means proper to pay a part and not the whole, I could not fore&s;ee any inconveniences that would attend the loan;&mdash;on the contrary, that it might contribute in &s;ome degree to for|ward their &s;chemes.&mdash;I hope my conduct in this in&s;tance will not be di&s;approved.</P>
<P>I inclo&s;ed governor Trumbull a copy of their letter and of their &s;everal re&s;olves, to-day, by colonel Broom and Mr. Duer, two members of the convention, who are going to wait on him; but did not think my&s;elf at liberty to urge or reque&s;t his in|tere&s;t in forming the camp of &s;ix thou&s;and men, as the levies, di|rected by Congre&s;s to be furni&s;hed the third of June, for the defence of this place, by that government, are but little more than one third come in. At the &s;ame time, the propo&s;ition I think a good one, if it could be carried into execution. In ca&s;e the enemy &s;hould attempt to effect a landing above King&s;|bridge, and to cut off the communication between this city and the country, an army to hang on their rear would di&s;tre&s;s them exceed|ingly.</P>

<P>YOUR favors of the eighteenth and nineteenth, with which you have been plea&s;ed to honor me, have been duly received, with the &s;everal re&s;olves alluded to.</P>
<P>When the letter and declaration from lord Howe to Mr. Franklin, and the other late governors, come to be publi&s;hed, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e the warme&s;t advocates for dependence on the Briti&s;h crown mu&s;t be &s;ilent, and be convinced beyond all po&s;|&s;ibility of doubt, that all that has been &s;aid about the commi&s;&s;i|oners was illu&s;ory, and calculated expre&s;sly to deceive and un|guard, not only the good people of our own country, but tho&s;e of the Engli&s;h nation that were aver&s;e to the proceedings of the king and mini&s;try. Hence we &s;ee the cau&s;e why a &s;peci|fication of their powers was not given the mayor and city of London, on their addre&s;s reque&s;ting it. That would have been dangerous, becau&s;e it would then have been manife&s;ted that the line of conduct they were to pur&s;ue would be totally variant from that they had indu&s;triou&s;ly propagated, and amu&s;ed the public with.&mdash;The uniting the civil and military offices in the &s;ame per&s;ons, too, mu&s;t be conclu&s;ive to every thinking one, that there is to be but little negociation of the civil kind.</P>
<P>I have inclo&s;ed for the &s;atisfaction of Congre&s;s, the &s;ub|&s;tance of what pa&s;&s;ed between my&s;elf and lieutenant-colonel Patter&s;on, adjutant-general, at an interview had ye&s;terday, in

con&s;equence of a reque&s;t from general Howe the day before;&mdash;to which I beg leave to refer them for particulars.</P>
<P>Colonel Knox of the train having often mentioned to me the nece&s;&s;ity of having a much more numerous body of artilleri&s;ts than what there now is, in ca&s;e the pre&s;ent conte&s;t &s;hould con|tinue longer,&mdash;and knowing the deficiency in this in&s;tance, and their extreme u&s;efulne&s;s,&mdash;I de&s;ired him to commit his ideas upon the &s;ubject to writing, in order that I might tran&s;mit them to Congre&s;s for their con&s;ideration. Agreeable to my reque&s;t, he has done it; and the propriety of his plan is now &s;ubmitted for their deci&s;ion. It is certain that we have not more at this time than are &s;ufficient for the &s;everal exten&s;ive po&s;ts we now have,&mdash;including draughts which he &s;peaks of, and which, I pre&s;ume (not only from what he has informed me, but from the nature of the thing,) can never be qualified to render the &s;ame &s;ervice as if they were regularly appointed and formed into a corps for that particular purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I beg leave to remind Congre&s;s that &s;ome time ago I laid be|fore them the propo&s;als of &s;ome per&s;ons here, for forming a com|pany of light-hor&s;e; and the pre&s;ident's an&s;wer a little time after, intimated that the plan &s;eemed to be approved of.&mdash;As tho&s;e who wanted to make up the troop are frequently pre&s;&s;ing me for an an|&s;wer, I could wi&s;h to be favored with the deci&s;ion of Congre&s;s upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>By a letter from general Schuyler, of the fourteenth in&s;tant|dated at Albany, he informs me, that, the day before, &s;ome de&s;perate de&s;igns of the tories in that quarter had been di&s;co|vered, the particulars of which he could not divulge, being under an oath of &s;ecrecy;&mdash;however, that &s;uch mea&s;ures had been taken, as to promi&s;e a prevention of the intended mi&s;chief: and that four of the con&s;pirators (among them a ringleader) were apprehended about one o'clock that morning, not far from the town. What the plot was, or who were concerned in it, is a matter I am ignorant of as yet.</P>

<P>CONGRESS having been plea&s;ed to appoint Mr. Wilper to the command of a company in the German battalion now rai&s;ing, I have directed him to repair to Philadelphia for their orders. From my acquaintance with him, I am per&s;uaded his conduct as an officer will merit their approbation: and, thank|ing them for their kind attention to my recommendation of him, I have the honor to be, with &s;entiments of the highe&s;t re|&s;pect, &amp;c.</P>

<P>I WAS honored with your favor of the twentieth by ye&s;|terday's po&s;t, &s;ince which, and my letter, nothing of moment has occurred.</P>
<P>The &s;hips, mentioned in my letter of the twenty-fir&s;t to have been in the offing, got in that day, and are &s;uppo&s;ed to be part of the Scotch fleer, having landed &s;ome Highlanders ye&s;|terday.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed I have the honor to tran&s;mit you copies of a letter and &s;undry re&s;olutions which I received la&s;t night from the convention of this &s;tate. They will inform you of the comput|ed number of inhabitants and &s;tock upon Na&s;&s;au-I&s;land, and their &s;entiments on the impracticability of removing the latter, and al&s;o of the mea&s;ures they think nece&s;&s;ary and likely to &s;ecure them.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o inclo&s;ed a letter from Mr. Fae&s;h to lord Sterling, upon the &s;ubject of a cannon-furnace for the u&s;e of the &s;tates. Congre&s;s will &s;ee his plan and propo&s;als, and determine upon them as they &s;hall judge proper.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I had the plea&s;ure of writing you by this morning's po&s;t, I was favored with a letter from governor Trumbull, a copy of which is inclo&s;ed, and to which I beg leave to refer you.&mdash;In regard to the &s;tock he mentions, I wrote to him, re|que&s;ting that they might be removed from the i&s;lands on which they were, as I conceived it of great importance to di&s;tre&s;s the enemy as much as po&s;&s;ible in the article of fre&s;h provi&s;ion.&mdash;
<PB N="170" REF="031423_0169_0FEC5A3B8529EE10">
I wi&s;h the other governments may follow his example, and have it removed from the I&s;lands belonging to them re&s;pec|tively.</P>
<P>When the &s;hips of war and tenders went up the river, it was thought expedient that application &s;hould be made for the Connecticut row-gallies and tho&s;e belonging to Rhode-I&s;land, in order to attempt &s;omething for their de&s;truction. As &s;oon as they arrive we &s;hall try to employ them in &s;ome u&s;eful way,&mdash;but in what, or how &s;ucce&s;sfully, I cannot at pre&s;ent deter|mine.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve what Mr. Trumbull &s;ays re|&s;pecting the continental regiment rai&s;ing under colonel Ward. If they incline to give any orders about their de&s;tination, you will plea&s;e to communicate them by the earlie&s;t opportunity, as their march will be &s;u&s;pended till they are known.</P>
<P>The orders Mr. Trumbull has given to the officers of their crui|&s;ers, to &s;top provi&s;ion ve&s;&s;els, &s;eem to be nece&s;&s;ary. We have too much rea&s;on to believe that &s;ome have gone voluntarily to the enemy, and that there are many per&s;ons who would continue to furni&s;h them with large &s;upplies; and, however upright the in|tentions of others may be, it will be a matter of the utmo&s;t diffi|culty, if not an impo&s;&s;ibility,&mdash;for any to e&s;cape falling into their hands now, as every part of the coa&s;t (it is probable) will &s;warm with their &s;hips of war and tenders. I had propo&s;ed writing to the convention of this &s;tate upon the &s;ubject before I received his letter; and am now more per&s;uaded of the nece&s;&s;ity of their taking &s;ome &s;teps to prevent further exportations down the Sound. In my next I &s;hall inform them of the intelligence receiv|ed from Mr. Trumbull, and recommend the matter to their atten|tion.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I have the honor to be, &amp;c. G. W.</SIGNED>
<POSTSCRIPT>
<P>It appears ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that the exportation of provi&s;ion &s;hould be &s;topped. Our army is large, and other|wi&s;e may want. Nor can individuals be injured, as they have a ready-money market for every thing they have to di&s;po&s;e of in that way.</P>

<P>Congre&s;s will do me the ju&s;tice to believe (I hope) that it is not my inclination or wi&s;h to run the continent to any unnece&s;&s;ary expen&s;e; and tho&s;e who better know me will not &s;u&s;pect that &s;how and parade can have any influence on my mind in this in&s;tance.&mdash;A conviction of the nece&s;&s;ity of it, for the regular di&s;charge of the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in me, is the governing motive for the application; and, as &s;uch, is &s;ubmitted to Congre&s;s by, &s;ir, your mo&s;t obe|dient, &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS ye&s;terday morning honored with your favor of the twenty-fourth in&s;tant with its &s;everal inclo&s;ures, to which I &s;hall pay the &s;tricte&s;t attention.</P>
<P>The confidence Congre&s;s are plea&s;ed to repo&s;e in my judg|ment demands my warme&s;t acknowledgments, and they may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured it &s;hall be invariably employed, &s;o far as it &s;hall be in my power, to promote their views and the public weal.</P>
<P>Since my la&s;t, nothing material has occurred.&mdash;Ye&s;terday even|ing report was made that eight &s;hips were &s;een in the offing, &s;tand|ing towards the Hook. The men-of-war and tenders are &s;till up the river. They have never attempted to pa&s;s the Highland for|tifications; and a day or two ago, quitted their &s;tation, and fell down the river eight or ten miles. The vigilance and activity of the militia oppo&s;ite where they were, have prevented their landing and doing much injury.&mdash;One poor pea&s;ant's cot they plundered and then burnt.</P>
<P>I would wi&s;h to know whether the allowance given to offi|cers, the &s;eventeenth of January, of a dollar and one third for every man they enli&s;t, Congre&s;s mean to extend to the officers
<PB N="172" REF="031423_0171_0FEC5A42178A69B8">
who enli&s;t for the new army for three years. At fir&s;t it may ap|pear wrong, or rather exorbitant, &s;uppo&s;ing that many will be re|cruited out of the regiments now in &s;ervice, and under them: but the allowance will be of great u&s;e, as it will intere&s;t the offi|cers, and call forth their exertions which otherwi&s;e would be faint and languid. Indeed I am fearful, from the enquiries I have made, that their utmo&s;t exertions will be attended with but little &s;ucce&s;s. It is objected that the bounty of ten dollars is too low; and argued,&mdash;"if the &s;tates furni&s;h men for five or &s;ix months, allow con&s;iderable more, why &s;hould that be accepted when the term of enli&s;tment is to be for three years?"&mdash;I heartily wi&s;h a bounty in land had been or could be given, as was propo&s;ed &s;ome time ago. I think it would be attended with &s;alutary con|&s;equences.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of my application to governor Trumbull, he has &s;ent me two row-gallies; and I expect another from him. None from governor Cooke are yet come; nor have I heard from him on the &s;ubject.&mdash;One is complete here.&mdash;The fire-&s;hips are going on under Mr. Ander&s;on's direction, but rather &s;lowly; and I am preparing &s;ome ob&s;tructions for the channel nearly oppo&s;ite the works at the upper end of this i&s;land.&mdash;When all things are ready, I intend to try, if it &s;hall &s;eem practicable, to de&s;troy the &s;hips and tenders above, and to employ the gallies, if they can be of advantage.</P>
<P>The militia for the flying camp come in but &s;lowly. By a return from general Mercer ye&s;terday, they are but little more than three thou&s;and. If they were in, or can be there &s;hortly, and the &s;ituation of the enemy remains the &s;ame, I would make &s;ome efforts to annoy them, keeping our po&s;ts here well guarded, and not putting too much to the hazard, or in any manner to the ri&s;k.</P>

<P>YOUR favor of the twenty-fourth I received on &s;aturday evening, and, agreeable to your reque&s;t, &s;hall expunge the pre|amble to the re&s;olution &s;ubjecting the property of &s;ubjects to the Briti&s;h crown to forfeiture and confi&s;cation.</P>
<P>Our &s;tock of mu&s;ket-powder is entirely made up into cart|ridges. I therefore reque&s;t that Congre&s;s will order four or five tons more of that &s;ort to be immediately forwarded; it be|ing

not only nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould have more for that purpo&s;e, but al&s;o &s;ome &s;tock to remain in barrels.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday evening Hutchin&s;on's and Sergeant's regiments from Bo&s;ton arrived: al&s;o two row-gallies from Rhode-I&s;land.&mdash;I am fearful the troops have not got entirely clear of the &s;mall-pox. I &s;hall u&s;e every po&s;&s;ible precaution to prevent the infection &s;pread|ing; and, for that purpo&s;e, have ordered them to an encampment &s;eparate and detached from the re&s;t.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS this morning honored with your two favors of ye&s;ter|day's date; and, agreeable to your reque&s;t, have given Mr. Palfrey liberty to negociate your claim with Mr. Brimmer, and wi&s;h it might be &s;atisfied agreeably to you.</P>
<P>I la&s;t night received a letter from general Schuyler, a copy of which I do my&s;elf the honor to tran&s;mit you. You will thereby perceive his rea&s;ons for leaving Crown-Point, and pre|fering the po&s;t the council of officers determined to take oppo&s;ite to Tyconderoga.&mdash;I am totally unacquainted with tho&s;e &s;everal po&s;ts and the country about them, and therefore cannot determine on the validity of his ob&s;ervations, or think my&s;elf at liberty to give any direction on the matter.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve what he &s;ays of their di&s;tre&s;s for money. From hence he can have no relief, there being on|ly about three or four thou&s;and dollars in the payma&s;ter's hands according to his return this morning,&mdash;and all but two months pay due to the army, be&s;ides many other demands,&mdash;I could
<PB N="174" REF="031423_0173_0FEC5A47D35FD2D8">
wi&s;h that proper &s;upplies of money could be always kept:&mdash;the want may occa&s;ion con&s;equences of an alarming nature.</P>
<P>By a letter from him, of a prior date to the copy inclo&s;ed, he tells me that a Mr. Ryckman, who has ju&s;t returned through the country of the Six-Nations, reports that the Indians who were at Philadelphia have gone home with very favorable ideas of our &s;trength and re&s;ources. This he heard in many of their vil|lages:&mdash;a lucky circum&s;tance, if it will either gain their friend|&s;hip or &s;ecure their neutrality.</P>
<P>In my letter of the twenty-&s;eventh I informed Congre&s;s of my views to attempt &s;omething again&s;t the troops on Staten-I&s;|land. I am now to acquaint them, that by the advice of gene|ral Mercer and other officers at Amboy, it will be impractica|ble to do any thing upon a large &s;cale, for want of craft, and as the enemy have the entire command of water all round the I&s;land.&mdash;I have de&s;ired general Mercer to have nine or ten flat-bottomed boats built at Newark-bay and Elizabeth-town, with a de&s;ign principally to keep up the communication acro&s;s Hackin&s;ac and Pa&s;&s;aic rivers, which I deemed a matter of great importance, and extremely nece&s;&s;ary to be attended to.</P>
<P>Since I wrote you ye&s;terday, eleven &s;hips more, four brigs, and two &s;loops, have come into the Hook. I have not yet received Intelligence what any of the late arrivals are: but I &s;uppo&s;e we &s;hall not long remain in a &s;tate of uncertainty.</P>
<P>Having rea&s;on to believe that lord Howe will readily come into an exchange of &s;uch pri&s;oners as may be more immediately under his command, and that &s;omething will be offered on this &s;ubject within a day or two, or rather come in an&s;wer to the propo&s;itions I have made general Howe, I &s;hould be glad to have Congre&s;s's interpretation of the re&s;olves of the twenty-&s;e|cond in&s;tant, empowering the commanders to exchange, &amp;c.&mdash;whether, by the word <HI>'&s;ailor,'</HI> they mean &s;ailors generally, as well tho&s;e taken in the ve&s;&s;els of private adventurers by the enemy, as tho&s;e belonging to the continental crui&s;ers, or ve&s;&s;els in the continent's employ; or whether they only de&s;ign to extend the exchange to the latter,&mdash;tho&s;e in their particular em|ploy.</P>
<P>I would al&s;o ob&s;erve, that, heretofore, &s;ailors belonging to merchants &s;hips that have fallen into our hands, and tho&s;e em|ployed merely as tran&s;ports, have not generally been con&s;idered as pri&s;oners.&mdash;I &s;ubmit it to Congre&s;s whether it may not be now nece&s;&s;ary to pa&s;s a re&s;olve declaring their &s;entiments on this &s;ubject, and, in general, who are to be treated as pri&s;oners of war, that are taken on board ve&s;&s;els belonging to the &s;ub|jects
<PB N="175" REF="031423_0174_0FEC5A4AEA253AF8">
of the Briti&s;h crown, &amp;c.&mdash;The re&s;ult of their opinion upon the fir&s;t que&s;tion propo&s;ed, you will plea&s;e to tran&s;mit me by the earlie&s;t opportunity.</P>
<P>I have inclo&s;ed, for the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s, a memo|rial and petition by captain Holdridge, praying to be relieved again&s;t the lo&s;s of money &s;tolen from him,&mdash;not conceiving my|&s;elf authori&s;ed to grant his reque&s;t. The certificate which at|tends it proves him to be a man of character; and his ca&s;e is hard, on his &s;tate of it.&mdash;Whether making the lo&s;s good may not open a door to others, and give ri&s;e to applications not &s;o ju&s;t as his may be, I cannot determine.&mdash;That &s;eems to be the only ob|jection to relieve him.</P>
<P>I am informed by general Putnam that there are &s;ome of the Stockbridge Indians here (I have not &s;een them my&s;elf) who expre&s;s great unea&s;ine&s;s at their not being employed by us, and have come to enquire into the cau&s;e. I am &s;en&s;ible Congre&s;s had them not in contemplation when they re&s;olved that Indians might be engaged in our &s;ervice. However, as they &s;eem &s;o anxious,&mdash;as they were led to expect it, from what general Schuyler and the other commi&s;&s;ioners did,&mdash;as we are under difficulties in getting men, and there may be danger of their (or &s;ome of them) taking an unfavorable part, I beg leave to &s;ubmit it as my opinion, under all the&s;e circum&s;tances, that they had bet|ter be employed.</P>

<P>I WAS honored with your favor of the thirty-fir&s;t ultimo on friday, with &s;everal inclo&s;ures; and return you my thanks for the agreeable intelligence you were plea&s;ed to communicate, of the arrival of one of our &s;hips with &s;uch valuable articles as arms and ammunition; al&s;o of the capture made by a priva|teer.</P>
<P>The mode for the exchange of pri&s;oners, re&s;olved on by Congre&s;s, is acceded to by general Howe, &s;o far as it comes within his command. A copy of my letter and his an&s;wer upon this &s;ubject I have the honor to inclo&s;e you; to which I beg leave to refer Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>The enclo&s;ed copy of a letter from colonel Tupper, who had the general command of the gallies, will inform Congre&s;s of the en|gagement between them and the &s;hips of war up the North-river, on &s;aturday evening, and of the damage we &s;u&s;tained. What in|jury was done to the &s;hips, I cannot a&s;certain. It is &s;aid they were hulled &s;everal times by our &s;hot. All accounts agree that our officers and men, during the whole of the affair, behaved with great &s;pirit and bravery. The damage done the gallies &s;hews beyond que&s;tion, that they had a warm time of it.&mdash;The &s;hips &s;till remain up the river? and, before any thing further can be attempted again&s;t them (&s;hould it be thought advi&s;able,) the gallies mu&s;t be repaired.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o tran&s;mitted Congre&s;s a copy of a letter I received by &s;aturday's po&s;t from governor Cooke, to which I refer them for the intelligence it contains. The &s;eizure of our ve&s;&s;els by the Portugue&s;e is, I fear, an event too true. Their dependence upon the Briti&s;h crown for aid again&s;t the Spaniards mu&s;t
<PB N="177" REF="031423_0176_0FEC5A50D7AB3FF8">
force them to comply with every thing required of them.&mdash;I wi&s;h the Morris may get &s;afe in with her cargo.&mdash;As to the &s;hips captain Buchlin &s;aw on the twenty-fifth ultimo, they are probably arrived: for ye&s;terday twenty-five &s;ail came into the Hook.</P>
<P>By a letter from general Ward, of the twenty-ninth ultimo, he informs me that two of our armed ve&s;&s;els, the day before, had brought into Marblehead a &s;hip bound from Halifax to Staten-I&s;land. She had in about fifteen hundred and nine pounds worth of Briti&s;h goods, be&s;ides a good many belonging to tories. A Halifax paper, found on board her, I have enclo&s;ed, as al&s;o an account &s;ent me by Mr. Hazard, tran&s;mitted him by &s;ome of his friends, as given by the tories taken in her. The intelligence, I dare &s;ay, is true, re&s;pecting the arrival of part of the He&s;&s;ian troops. General Ward in his letter mentions, that, the day this prize was taken, captain Burke, in another of our armed ve&s;&s;els, had an engagement with a &s;hip and a &s;chooner which he thought were tran&s;ports, and would have taken them, had it not been for an unlucky accident in having his quarter-deck blown up. Two of his men were killed, and &s;everal more were wounded.</P>
<P>The hulks and chevaux-de-fri&s;e, that have been preparing to ob&s;truct the channel&punc; have got up to the place they are intended for, and will be &s;unk as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my letter of the fifth, which I had the honor of addre&s;&s;ing you, I beg leave to recall the attention of Congre&s;s to the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity there is for appointing more general officers,&mdash;promi&s;ing at the &s;ame time, by the fir&s;t opportunity, to give my &s;entiments more at large upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Confident I am that the po&s;tponing this mea&s;ure has not proceed|ed from motives of frugality: otherwi&s;e I &s;hould take liberty of attempting to prove that we put too much to the hazard of &s;uch a &s;aving.&mdash;I am but too well appri&s;ed of the difficulties that occur in the choice. They are, I acknowledge, great; but at the &s;ame time it mu&s;t be allowed, they are of &s;uch a nature as to pre&s;ent them&s;elves whenever the &s;ubject is thought of. Time on the one hand does not remove them; on the other delay may be productive of fatal con&s;equences.</P>
<P>This army, though far &s;hort as yet of the numbers intended by Congre&s;s, is by much too unwieldy for the command of any one man, without &s;everal major-generals to a&s;&s;i&s;t. For it is to be ob&s;erved, that a brigadier-general at the head of his bri|gade, is no more than a colonel at the head of a regiment, except that he acts upon a larger &s;cale. Officers of more general com|mand are at all times wanted for the good order and govern|ment of an army, e&s;pecially when the army is compo&s;ed chiefly of raw troops: but in an action they are indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;|&s;ary.&mdash;At pre&s;ent there is but one major-general for this whole department and the flying camp; whereas, at this place alone, le&s;s than three cannot di&s;charge the duties with that regularity they ought to be.</P>
<P>If the&s;e major-generals are appointed, as undoubtedly they will, out of the pre&s;ent brigadiers, you will want for this place three brigadiers at lea&s;t.&mdash;The northern department will require one, if not two (as general Thomp&s;on is a pri&s;oner, and the baron Woedtke reported to be dead o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> in a &s;tate not much better,) there being at pre&s;ent only one brigadier-general (Arnold) in all that department.&mdash;For the ea&s;tern govern|ments there ought to be one, or a major-general, to &s;uperin|tend the regiments there, and to prevent impo&s;itions that might otherwi&s;e be practi&s;ed.&mdash;The&s;e make the number wanted to be &s;ix or &s;even: and who are to be appointed, Congre&s;s can be&s;t judge.</P>
<P>To make brigadiers of the olde&s;t colonels would be the lea&s;t exceptionable way: but it is much to be que&s;tioned, whether by that mode the able&s;t men would be appointed to office.
<PB N="179" REF="031423_0178_0FEC5A5A438F7408">
And I would ob&s;erve, though the rank of the colonels of the ea&s;tern governments was &s;ettled at Cambridge la&s;t year, it only re&s;pected them&s;elves, and is &s;till open as to officers of other governments. To pick a colonel here and a colonel there through the army, according to the opinion entertained of their abilities, would no doubt be the means of making a better choice, and nominating the fitte&s;t per&s;ons: but then the &s;enior officers would get di&s;gu&s;ted, and, more than probable, with their connexions, quit the &s;ervice.&mdash;That might prove fatal at this time.&mdash;To appoint gentlemen as brigadiers that had not &s;erv|ed in this army (in this part of it at lea&s;t,) would not wound any one in particular, but hurt the whole equally, and mu&s;t be con&s;idered in a very di&s;couraging light by every officer of merit.&mdash;View the matter therefore in any point of light you will, there are inconveniencies on the one hand, and difficulties on the other, which ought to be avoided.&mdash;Would they be re|medied by appointing the olde&s;t colonels from each &s;tate?&mdash;If this mode &s;hould be thought expedient, the enclo&s;ed li&s;t gives the names of the colonels, from New-Hamp&s;hire to Penn&s;ylvania inclu&s;ive, &s;pecifying tho&s;e who rank fir&s;t, as I am told, in the &s;e|veral colony li&s;ts.</P>
<P>I have tran&s;mitted a copy of a letter from Mr. John Glover, &s;etting forth the nature and grounds of a di&s;pute between him and a Mr. Bradford, re&s;pecting their agency, not conceiving my&s;elf authori&s;ed, nor having the &s;malle&s;t inclination to interfere in any degree in the matter, it is referred to Congre&s;s, who will determine and give direction upon it in &s;uch manner as they &s;hall judge be&s;t. I will only ob&s;erve, that Mr. Glover was recommended to me as a proper per&s;on for an agent, when we fir&s;t fitted out armed ve&s;&s;els, and was accordingly appointed one; and &s;o far as I know, di&s;charged his office with fidelity and indu&s;try.</P>
<P>I received ye&s;terday evening a letter from general Schuyler, con|taining lieutenant M'Michael's report, who had been &s;ent a &s;cout to O&s;wego. A copy of the report I have enclo&s;ed for the inform|ation of Congre&s;s, le&s;t general Schuyler &s;hould have omitted it in his letter which accompanies this. He was at the German-Flatts when he wrote, which was the &s;econd in&s;tant, and the treaty with the Indians not begun&punc; nor had the whole expected, then arrived.&mdash;But of the&s;e things he will have advi&s;ed you more fully, I make no doubt.</P>
<P>The payma&s;ter informs me he received a &s;upply of money ye&s;terday. It came very &s;ea&s;onably: for the applications and

<P>The&s;e men under&s;tand that the attack will &s;oon be made if the other troops arrive:&mdash;that they give out they will lay the Jer&s;eys wa&s;te with fire and &s;word;&mdash;that the computed &s;trength of their army will be thirty thou&s;and men. They further add, that when they left Carolina, one tran&s;port got on &s;hore, &s;o that they were not able to give her relief; upon which, &s;he &s;urrendered, with five companies of Highlanders, to general Lee, who, after taking every thing valuable out of her, burnt her;&mdash;that the admiral turned general Clinton out of his &s;hip after the engagement with a great deal of abu&s;e;&mdash;great differences between the principal naval and military gentlemen;&mdash;that the &s;hips left in Carolina, are now in &s;uch a weakly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed condition, they would fall an ea&s;y prey.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY ye&s;terday morning's po&s;t, I was honored with your favor of the &s;econd in&s;tant, with &s;undry re&s;olutions of Congre&s;s, to which I &s;hall pay &s;trict attention.</P>
<P>As the propo&s;ition for employing the Stockbridge Indians has been approved, I have wrote to Mr. Edwards, one of the commi&s;|&s;ioners, and who lives among them, reque&s;ting him to engage them, or &s;uch as are willing, to enter the &s;ervice. I have directed him to indulge them with liberty to join this or the northern army, or both, as their inclinations may lead.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h the &s;alutary con&s;equences may re&s;ult from the regulation re&s;pecting &s;eamen taken, that Congre&s;s have in view. From the nature of this kind of people, and the privileges granted on their entering into our &s;ervice, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e many of them will do it.&mdash;We want them much.</P>
<P>I ye&s;terday tran&s;mitted the intelligence I received from the de&s;erters from the Solebay man-of-war.&mdash;The inclo&s;ed copy of a letter by la&s;t night's po&s;t, from the honorable Mr. Bowdoin, with the information of a captain Kennedy lately taken, corro|borate their accounts re&s;pecting the He&s;&s;ian troops. Indeed his report makes the fleet and armament, to be employed a|gain&s;t us, greater then we have heard they would be. Howe|ver, there remains no doubt of their being both large and for|midable, and &s;uch as will require our mo&s;t vigorous exertions to oppo&s;e them. Per&s;uaded of this, and knowing how much inferior our numbers are and will be to theirs when the whole of their troops arrive,&mdash;of the important con&s;equences that may and will flow from the appeal that will &s;oon be made&mdash;I have wrote to Connecticut and New-Jer&s;ey, for all the &s;uccour they can afford, and al&s;o to the convention of this &s;tate.&mdash;What I may receive, and in what time, the event mu&s;t determine. But I would fain hope, the &s;ituation and the exigency of our affairs will call forth the mo&s;t &s;trenuous efforts and early a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e who are friends to the cau&s;e. I confe&s;s there is but too much occa&s;ion for their exertions. I confidently tru&s;t they will not be withheld.</P>
<P>I have inclo&s;ed a copy of a letter from Mr. Bowdoin re&s;pect|ing the ea&s;tern Indians. Congre&s;s will thereby perceive that they profe&s;s them&s;elves to be well attached to our intere&s;t,&mdash;
<PB N="182" REF="031423_0181_0FEC5A619CB7A770">
and the &s;ummary of the mea&s;ures taken to engage them in our &s;ervice. I have the treaty at large between the honorable council of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, on behalf of the United States, with the delegates of the St. John's and Mikmac tribes. The proba|bility of a copy's being &s;ent already, and its great length, prevent one coming herewith. If Congre&s;s had it not forwarded to them, I will &s;end a copy by the fir&s;t opp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rtunity after notice that it has not been received.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 9.&mdash;By a report received from general Greene la&s;t night, at &s;un&s;et and a little after, about a hundred boats were &s;een bringing troops from Staten-I&s;land to the &s;hips, three of which had fallen down towards the Narrows, having taken in &s;oldiers from thirty of the boats. He adds, that, by the be&s;t ob&s;ervations of &s;everal officers, there appeared to be a general embarkation.</P>
<P>I have wrote to general Mercer for two thou&s;and men from the flying camp. Colonel Smallwood's battalion, as part of them, I expect this forenoon: but where the re&s;t are to come from, I know not, as, by the general's la&s;t return, not more than three or four hundred of the new levies had got in.</P>
<P>In my letter of the fifth I inclo&s;ed a general return of the ar|my under my immediate command, but I imagine the follow|ing &s;tate will give Congre&s;s a more perfect idea, though not a more agreeable one, of our &s;ituation, For the &s;everal po&s;ts on New-York, Long and Governor's I&s;lands, and Paulus-Hook, we have, fit for duty, ten thou&s;and five hundred and fourteen,&mdash;&s;ick pre&s;ent, three thou&s;and and thirty-nine&mdash;&s;ick ab&s;ent, &s;ix hun|dred and twenty-nine,&mdash;on command, two thou&s;and nine hun|dred and forty &s;ix,&mdash;on furlough, ninety-&s;even,&mdash;total, &s;even|teen thou&s;and two hundred and twenty-five. In addition to the&s;e, we are only certain of colonel Smallwood's battalion in ca&s;e of an immediate attack. Our po&s;ts are too much divid|ed, having waters between many of them, and &s;ome di&s;tant from others, fifteen miles. The&s;e circum&s;tances, &s;ufficiently di&s;tre&s;&s;|ing of them&s;elves, are much aggravated by the &s;ickne&s;s that prevails through the army. Every day more or le&s;s are ta|ken down; &s;o that the proportion of men that may come in can|not be con&s;idered as a real and &s;erviceable augmentation on the whole.</P>
<P>The&s;e things are melancholy; but they are neverthele&s;s true. I hope for better.&mdash;Under every di&s;advantage, my utmo&s;t exer|tions &s;hall be employed to bring about the great end we have in view: and, &s;o far as I can judge from the profe&s;&s;ions and ap|parant di&s;po&s;ition of my troops, I &s;hall have their &s;upport. The
<PB N="183" REF="031423_0182_0FEC5A8BB14C1E00">
&s;uperiority of the enemy and the expected attack do not &s;eem to have depre&s;&s;ed their &s;pirits. The&s;e con&s;iderations lead me to think, that, though the appeal may not terminate &s;o happily in our favor as I could wi&s;h, yet they will not &s;ucceed in their views without con&s;iderable lo&s;s. Any advantage they may get, I tru&s;t, will co&s;t them dear.</P>
<P><HI>Eight o'clock, A. M.</HI></P>
<P>By the reverend Mr. Madi&s;on and a Mr. John&s;on, two gentlemen of Virginia who came from Staten-I&s;land ye&s;terday, where they arrived the day before in the packet with colonel Guy John&s;on, I am informed that nothing material had taken place in England when they left it;&mdash;that there had been a change in the French mini&s;try, which, many people thought, foreboded a war:&mdash;that it &s;eemed to be believed by many that Congre&s;s would attempt to buy off the foreign troops, and that it might be effected without great difficulty. Their accounts from Staten-I&s;land nearly corre&s;pond with what we had before: they &s;ay that every preparation is making for an attack;&mdash;that the force now upon the I&s;land is about fifteen thou&s;and;&mdash;that they appear very impatient for the arrival of the foreign troops, but a very &s;mall part having got in. Whether they would at|tempt any thing before they come, they are uncertain: but they are &s;ure they will as &s;oon as they arrive, if not before.&mdash;They &s;ay, from what they could collect from the conver&s;ation of officers, &amp;c. they mean to hem us in by getting above us and cut|ting off all communication with the country.</P>
<P>That this is their plan, &s;eems to be corroborated and confirmed by the circum&s;tance of &s;ome &s;hips of war going out at different times within a few days pa&s;t, and other ve&s;&s;els. It is probable that a part are to go round and come up the Sound.</P>
<P>Mr. Madi&s;on &s;ays lord How's powers were not known when he left England;&mdash;that general Conway moved, before his depar|ture, that they might be laid before the commons; and had his motion rejected by a large majority.</P>

<P>I HAVE been duly honored with your favors of the eighth and tenth in&s;tant, with the &s;everal inclo&s;ures. I &s;hall pay attention to the re&s;olution re&s;pecting lieutenant Jo&s;iah, and attempt to relieve him from his rigorous u&s;age,&mdash;Your letters to

&s;uch of the gentlemen as were here have been delivered. The re&s;t will be &s;ent by the fir&s;t opportunity.</P>
<P>Since my la&s;t of the eighth and ninth, the enemy have made no movements of con&s;equence. They remain nearly in the &s;ame &s;tate; nor have we any further intelligence of their de&s;igns. They have not been yet joined by the remainder of the fleet with the He&s;&s;ian troops</P>
<P>Colonel Small wood and his battalion got in on friday; and colo|nel Miles is al&s;o here with two battalions more of Penn&s;ylvanian riflemen.</P>
<P>The convention of thir &s;tate have been exerting them&s;elves to call forth a portion of their militia to an encampment form|ing above King&s;bridge, to remain in &s;ervice for the &s;pace of one month after their arrival there; and al&s;o half of tho&s;e in King and Queen's counties, to reinforce the troops on Long-I&s;land till the fir&s;t of September, unle&s;s &s;ooner di&s;charged. General Morris too is to take po&s;t with his brigade on the Sound and Hud&s;on's-river for ten days, to annoy the enemy in ca&s;e they attempt to land; and others of their militia are directed to be in readine&s;s, in ca&s;e their aid &s;hould be required. Upon the whole, from the information I have from the convention, the militia ordered are now in motion, or will be in a little time, and will amount to about three thou&s;and or more. From Connecticut, I am not certain what &s;uccours are coming. By one or two gen|tlemen who have come from thence, I am told &s;ome of the militia are a&s;&s;embling, and, from the intelligence they had, would march this week.</P>
<P>By a letter from governor Trumbull, of the fifth, I am advi&s;ed that the troops from that &s;tate, de&s;tined for the northern ar|my, had marched for Skene&s;borough.&mdash;General Ward too, by a letter of the fourth, informs me that the regiments would march from Bo&s;ton la&s;t week, having been clean&s;ed and gen|erally recovered from the &s;mall-pox. I have al&s;o countermand|ed my orders to colonel Elmore, and directed him to join the northern army, having heard, after my orders to Connecticut for his marching hither, that he and mo&s;t of his regiment were at Albany or within its vicinity,&mdash;General Ward mentions that the council of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts &s;tate will have in from two or three thou&s;and of their militia to defend their lines and different po&s;ts, in lieu of the regiments ordered from thence agreeable to the re|&s;olution of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>The inclo&s;ed copy of a re&s;olve of this &s;tate, pa&s;&s;ed the renth in&s;tant, will di&s;cover the apprehen&s;ion they are under of the defec|tion of the inhabitants of Kings' county from the common cau&s;e,
<PB N="185" REF="031423_0184_0FEC5A6B4D5A51D8">
and of the mea&s;ures they have taken thereupon. I have directed general Greene to give the committee &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance as he can, and they may require, in the execution of their com|mi&s;&s;ion; though at the &s;ame time, I wi&s;h the information the convention have received upon the &s;ubject may prove ground|le&s;s.</P>
<P>I would beg leave to mention to Congre&s;s, that, in a letter I received from general Lee, he mentions the valuable con&s;equences that would re&s;ult from a number of cavalry being employed in the &s;outhern department. Without them (to u&s;e his own expre&s;&s;ions) he can an&s;wer for nothing:&mdash;with one thou&s;and he would en&s;ure the &s;afety of tho&s;e &s;tates.&mdash;I &s;hould have done my&s;elf the honor of &s;ubmitting this matter to Congre&s;s before, at his particular reque&s;t, had it not e&s;caped my mind.&mdash;From his acquaintance with that country, and the nature of the grounds, I doubt not he has weighed the matter well and pre&s;ume he has fully repre&s;ented the advantages that would ari&s;e from the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;uch a corps&mdash;all I mean, is, in compliance with his requi&s;ition, to mention the matter, that &s;uch con&s;ideration may be had upon it (if not already determined) as it may be de&s;erv|ing of.</P>
<P>I have tran&s;mitted a general return, whereby Congre&s;s will per|ceive the whole of our &s;trength, except the two battalions un|der colonel Miles, which, coming &s;ince it was made out, are not included.</P>
<P>I have inclo&s;ed a letter ju&s;t come to hand from Martinique. Congre&s;s will plea&s;e to con&s;ider of the purport, favoring me with their an&s;wer and a return of the letter.</P>
<P>This moment (ten o'clock) report is made by general Greene that a man-of-war came in ye&s;terday, and that &s;ixty fail of &s;hips are now &s;tanding in.&mdash;No doubt they are a further part of the He&s;|&s;ian fleet.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I had the honor of addre&s;&s;ing you on monday, no|thing of importance has occurred here, except that the enemy have received an augmentation to their fleet, of ninety-&s;ix &s;hips:&mdash;&s;ome reports make them more. In a letter I wrote you ye&s;terday by lieutenant-colonel Reed, I advi&s;ed you of this: but pre&s;uming it may not reach you &s;o &s;oon as this will, I have thought proper to mention the intelligence again.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed I have the honor to tran&s;mit a copy of the exami|nation of a de&s;erter, &s;ent me this morning by general Mercer,
<PB N="187" REF="031423_0186_0FEC5A732631FFF8">
to which I beg leave to refer Congre&s;s for the late&s;t accounts I have from the enemy. Whether the intelligence he has given is literally true, I cannot determine: but as to the attack, we daily expect it.</P>
<P>Your favor of the tenth, with its inclo&s;ures, was duly received; and I have in&s;tructed the &s;everal officers who were promoted, to act in their &s;tations as you reque&s;ted, though their commi&s;&s;ions were not &s;ent.</P>
<P>As we are in extreme want of tents and covering for this army,&mdash;a great part of tho&s;e at the out-po&s;ts having nothing to &s;helter them, nor hou&s;es to go into,&mdash;I &s;ubmit it to Con|gre&s;s whether it may not be prudent to remand tho&s;e that were lately &s;ent to Bo&s;ton, where there are no troops at pre&s;ent; and, if there were, the nece&s;&s;ity for them would not be great, as the town, and barracks at &s;everal of the po&s;ts, would be &s;ufficient to receive them.</P>
<P>The inclo&s;ed letter from lieutenant-colonel Hen&s;haw will di&s;|cover to Congre&s;s his views and wi&s;hes, which they will con&s;ider and determine on, in whatever way they think right and condu|cive to the public good; meaning only to lay his letter be|fore them.</P>
<P>I take the liberty of mentioning that colonel Varnum of Rhode-I&s;land has been with me this morning to re&s;ign his commi&s;&s;ion, conceiving him&s;elf to be greatly injured in not having been noticed in the late arrangement and promotion of general officers.&mdash;I re|mon&s;trated again&s;t the impropriety of the mea&s;ure at this time; and he has con&s;ented to &s;tay till affairs wear a different a&s;pect from what they do at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><HI>Eleven o'clock.</HI>&mdash;By a report ju&s;t come to hand from general Greene, twenty &s;hips more are coming in.</P>

<P>This will be delivered you by captain Moeballe, a Dutch gentleman from Surrinam, who has come to the continent with a view of entering into the &s;ervice of the &s;tates, as you will perceive by the inclo&s;ed letters from Mr. Browne of Providence, and gene|ral Greene. What other letters and credentials he has, I know not, but, at his reque&s;t, have given him this line to Congre&s;s, to whom he wi&s;hes to be introduced, and where he will make his pretentions known.</P>

<P>As the &s;ituation of the two armies mu&s;t engage the attention of Congre&s;s, and lead them to expect that each returning day will produce &s;ome important events, this is meant to inform them that nothing of moment has yet ca&s;t up. In the even|ing of ye&s;terday there were great movements among their boats; and, from the number that appeared to be pa&s;&s;ing and re|pa&s;&s;ing about the Narrows, we were induced to believe they in|tended to land a part of their force upon Long-I&s;land: but, having no report from general Greene, I pre&s;ume they have not done it.</P>

<P>I BEG leave to inform you, that, &s;ince I had the plea&s;ure of addre&s;&s;ing you ye&s;terday, nothing intere&s;ting between the two ar|mies has happened. Things remain nearly in the &s;ituation they then were.</P>
<P>It is with peculiar regret and concern that I have an op|portunity of mentioning to Congre&s;s the &s;ickly condition of our troops. In &s;ome regiments there are not any of the field-officers capable of doing duty; in others the duty is extremely dif|ficult for want of a &s;ufficient number.

<P>THE circum&s;tances of the two armies having undergone no material alteration &s;ince I had the honor of writing to you la&s;t, I have nothing particular or important to communicate re&s;pecting them.</P>
<P>In my letter of ye&s;terday I forget to mention the arrival of lord Dunmore here. By the examination of captain Hunter (who e&s;caped from the enemy, and came to Amboy on the fourteenth) tran&s;mitted me by general Roberdeau, I am cer|tainly informed his lord&s;hip arrived on the thirteenth. The ex|amination does not &s;ay any thing about the &s;hips he brought with him: it only extends to his force, which it mentions to be weak.</P>
<P>I before now expected the enemy would have made their at|tack: nor can I account for their deferring it, unle&s;s the intelli|gence, given by captain Hunter and another per&s;on who e&s;caped about the &s;ame time, is the cau&s;e,&mdash;to wit, that they are waiting the arrival of another divi&s;ion of the He&s;&s;ian troops, which (they &s;ay) is &s;till out. Whether that is the rea&s;on of the delay, I can|not undertake to determine: but I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e things will not long remain in their pre&s;ent &s;tate.&mdash;I have enclo&s;ed a copy of gene|ral Roberdeau's letter, and of the examination of tho&s;e two per&s;ons, which will &s;hew Congre&s;s all the information they have given upon the&s;e &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>I am ju&s;t now advi&s;ed by Mr. Aires who came from Phila|delphia to build the row-gallies, that two of our fire-ve&s;&s;els at|tempted la&s;t night to burn the enemy's &s;hips and tenders up the river. He &s;ays that they burned one tender, and one of them boarded the Phoenix, and was grappled with her for near ten minutes; but &s;he cleared her&s;elf.&mdash;We lo&s;t both of the ve&s;&s;els. His account is not &s;o particular as I could wi&s;h; however, I am certain the attempt has not &s;ucceeded to our wi&s;hes. In a little time it is probable the matter will be more minutely re|ported.</P>

<P>I HAVE been honored with your favor of the &s;ixteenth with the inclo&s;ure, and am &s;orry it is not in my power to tran&s;|mit Congre&s;s a copy of the treaty as they require, having &s;ent it away with the other papers that were in my hands.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="031423_0189_0FEC5A796D67FA48">
The re&s;olution they have entered into re&s;pecting the foreign troops, I am pur&s;uaded, would produce &s;alutary effects, if it could be properly circulated among them. I fear it will be a matter of difficulty. However I will take every mea&s;ure that &s;hall appear probable to faciliate the end.</P>
<P>I have the honor to inclo&s;e you, for the peru&s;al and con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s, &s;undry papers marked No. 1 to No. 7 inclu&s;ive, the whole of which, except No. 2 and 7 (my an&s;wers to lord Drum|mond and general Howe) I received ye&s;terday evening by a flag, and to which I beg leave to refer Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>I am exceedingly at a lo&s;s to know the motives and cau&s;es in|ducing a proceeding of &s;uch a nature at this time, and why lord Howe has not attempted &s;ome plan of negociation before, as he &s;eems &s;o de&s;irous of it. If I may be allowed to conjecture and gue&s;s at the cau&s;e, it may be that part of the He&s;&s;ians have not arrived, as mentioned in the examination tran&s;mitted ye&s;terday,&mdash;or that general Burgoyne has not made &s;uch progre&s;s as was ex|pected, to form a junction of their two armies,&mdash;or, what I think equally probable, they mean to procra&s;tinate their operations for &s;ome time, tru&s;ting that the militias which have come to our &s;uccour, will &s;oon become tired and return home, as is but too u&s;ual with them.&mdash;Congre&s;s will make their ob&s;ervations upon the&s;e &s;everal matters, and favor me with the re&s;ult as &s;oon as they have done.&mdash;They will ob&s;erve my an&s;wer to lord Drummond, who (I am pretty confident) has not attended to the terms of his parole, but has violated it in &s;everal in&s;tances. It is with the re&s;t of the papers: but, if my memory &s;erves me, he was not to hold any corre&s;pondence directly or indirectly with tho&s;e in arms again&s;t us, or to go into any port or harbor in America, where the enemy them&s;elves were or had a fleet, or to go on board their &s;hips.</P>
<P>The treaty with the Indians is in the box which lieutenant-colonel Reed, I pre&s;ume, has delivered before this. If Con|gre&s;s are de&s;irous of &s;eeing it, they will be plea&s;ed to have the box opened. It contains a variety of papers, and all the affairs of the army, from my fir&s;t going to Cambridge, till it was &s;ent away.</P>
<P>This morning, the Phoenix and Ro&s;e men-of-war, with two tenders, availing them&s;elxes of a favorable and bri&s;k wind, came down the river, and have joined the fleet. Our &s;everal batteries fired at them in their pa&s;&s;age, but without any good effect that I could perceive.</P>

<P>I HAVE nothing of moment to communicate to Congre&s;s, as things are in the &s;ituation they were in when I had la&s;t the honor of addre&s;&s;ing them.</P>
<P>By a letter from general Ward, of the twelfth, I find that Whit|comb's regiment, on the eighth, and Phinney's on the ninth, marched from Bo&s;ton for Tyconderoga.</P>
<P>Governor Trumbull al&s;o, in a letter of the thirteenth, advi&s;es me that Ward's regiment in the &s;ervice of the &s;tates was on the march to this army, and that he and his council of &s;afety had in the whole ordered fourteen militia regiments to reinforce us. Three of them have arrived, and amount to about a thou&s;and and twenty men. When the whole come in, we &s;hall be on a much more re&s;pectable footing than we have been: but I greatly fear, if the enemy defer their attempt for any con&s;iderable time, they will be extremely impatient to return home; and if they &s;hould, we &s;hall be reduced to di&s;tre&s;s again.</P>
<P>He al&s;o adds that captain Van Buren, who had been &s;ent for that purpo&s;e had procured a &s;ufficient &s;upply of &s;ail-cloth for the ve&s;&s;els to be employed on the lake, and a part of the cor|dage, in that &s;tate: and had a pro&s;pect of getting the remain|der.</P>
<P>As there will be a difficulty in all probability to circulate the papers de&s;igned for the foreign troops, and many mi&s;carriages may happen before it can be effected, it may be proper to furni&s;h me with a larger quantity than what I already have.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed I have the honor to tran&s;mit you a general return of our whole force at this time, in which are comprehended the three re|giments of militia above mentioned. I am &s;orry it &s;hould be &s;o much weakened by &s;ickne&s;s. The return will &s;hew you how it di&s;tre&s;&s;es us.</P>

<P>I WAS ye&s;terday morning favored with yours of the &s;even|teenth, accompanied by &s;everal re&s;olutions of Congre&s;s, and commi&s;&s;ions for officers appointed to the late vacancies in this army.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="031423_0191_0FEC5A8553AD79C0">
I wrote &s;ome days ago to general Schuyler to propo&s;e to generals Carleton and Burgoyne an exchange of pri&s;oners in con&s;equence of a former re&s;olve of Congre&s;s authori&s;ing their commanders in each department to negociate one. That of major Meigs for ma|jor French, and captain Dearborn's for any officer of equal rank, I &s;ubmitted to general Howe's con&s;ideration, by letter, on the &s;eventeenth, under&s;tanding their paroles had been &s;ent him by general Carleton; but have not yet received his an&s;wer upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to the exchange of the pri&s;oners in Canada, if a propo&s;ition on that head has not been already made (and I believe it has not), the inclo&s;ed copy of general Carleton's orders (tran&s;|mitted me under &s;eal by major Bigelow, who was &s;ent with a flag to general Burgoyne from Tyconderoga, with the proceedings of Congre&s;s on the breach of capitulation at the Cedars, and the inhuman treatment of our people afterwards) will &s;hew it is un|nece&s;&s;ary, as he has determined to &s;end them to their own provin|ces, their to remain as pri&s;oners; interdicting at the &s;ame time all kind of intercour&s;e between us and his army, except &s;uch as may be for the purpo&s;e of imploring the king's mercy.&mdash;The a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination he mentions, of brigadier-general Gordon, is a fact entirely new to me, and what I never heard of before.&mdash;I &s;hall not trouble Congre&s;s with my &s;trictures upon this * * * perfor|mance, * * * only ob&s;erving that its de&s;ign is &s;omewhat artful, and that each boatman with major Bigelow was furni&s;hed with a copy.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o tran&s;mitted Congre&s;s a copy of the major's journal, to which I beg leave to refer them for the intelligence reported by him on his return from the truce.</P>
<P>By a letter from general Greene ye&s;terday evening, he informed me he had received an expre&s;s from Hog-I&s;land inlet, advi&s;ing that five of the enemy's &s;mall ve&s;&s;els had appeared at the mouth of the creek, with &s;ome troops on board;&mdash;al&s;o that he had heard two periaguas were off Oy&s;ter-Bay,&mdash;the whole &s;uppo&s;ed to be after live &s;tock:&mdash;and, to prevent their getting it, he had detached a party of hor&s;e, and two hundred and twenty men, among them twenty riflemen. I have not received further intelligence upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I am al&s;o advi&s;ed by the examination of a captain Button (ma&s;ter of a ve&s;&s;el that had been taken) tran&s;mitted me by ge|neral Mercer, that the general report among the enemy's troops, when he came off, was, that they were to attack Long-I&s;land, and to &s;ecure our works there if po&s;&s;ible, at the &s;ame time another part of their army was to land above this city.
<PB N="193" REF="031423_0192_0FEC5A876D033950">
This information is corroborated by many other accounts, and is probably true: nor will it be po&s;&s;ible to prevent them landing on the i&s;land, as its great extent affords a variety of places favor|able for that purpo&s;e, and the whole of our works on it are at the end oppo&s;ite to the city. However, we &s;hall attempt to harra&s;s them as much as po&s;&s;ible, which will be all that we can do.&mdash;I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</P>

<P>THE irregularity of the po&s;t prevents your receiving the ear|ly and con&s;tant intelligence it is my wi&s;h to communicate. This is the third letter which you will probably receive from me by the &s;ame po&s;t. The fir&s;t was of little or no con&s;equence:
<PB N="195" REF="031423_0194_0FEC5A8EE5D541C8">
but that of ye&s;terday gave you the be&s;t information I had been able to obtain, of the enemy's landing and movements upon Long-I&s;land.&mdash;Having occa&s;ion to go over thither ye&s;terday, I &s;ent my letter to the po&s;t-office at the u&s;ual hour, being informed that the rider was expected every moment, and would out again di|rectly: but in the evening when I &s;ent to inquire, none had come in.</P>
<P>I now inclo&s;e you a report made to me by general Sullivan after I left Long-I&s;land ye&s;terday. I do not conceive that the enemy's whole force was in motion, but a detached party rather. I have &s;ent over four more regiments, with boats, to be ready either to reinforce the troops under general Sullivan, or to return to this place, if the remainder of the fleet at the watering-place &s;hould pu&s;h up to the city; which hitherto (I mean &s;ince the landing upon Long-I&s;land) they have not had in their power to do, on account of the wind which has either been ahead or too &s;mall when the tide has &s;erved. I have nothing further to trouble the Congre&s;s with at pre&s;ent, than that I am theirs and your mo&s;t obedient hum|ble &s;ervant,</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been duly honored with your favors of the twentieth and twenty-fourth, and am happy to find my an&s;wer to lord Drum|mond has met the approbation of Congre&s;s. Whatever his views were, mo&s;t certainly his conduct re&s;pecting his parole is highly re|prehen&s;ible.</P>
<P>Since my letter of the twenty-fourth, almo&s;t the whole of the enemy's fleet have fallen down to the Narrows; and, from this circum&s;tance, and the &s;triking of their tents at their &s;ev|eral encampments on Staten-I&s;land from time to time, previous to the departure of the &s;hips from thence, we are led to think they mean to land the main body of their army on Long-I&s;land, and to make their grand pu&s;h there. I have ordered over con&s;id|erable reinforcements to our troops there, and &s;hall continue to &s;end more as circum&s;tances may require. There has been a little &s;kirmi&s;hing and irregular &s;iring kept up between their and our ad|vanced guards, in which colonel Martin of the Jer&s;ey levies has re|ceived a wound in his brea&s;t, which, it is apprehended, will prove mortal; a private has had his leg broke by a cannon-ball, and another has received a &s;hot in the groin from their mu&s;ketry. This is all the damage they have yet done us;&mdash;what they have &s;u&s;|tained, is not known.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="031423_0195_0FEC5A90A0E58240">
The &s;hifting and changing the regiments have undergone of late has prevented their making proper returns, and of cour&s;e put it out of my power to tran&s;mit a general one of the army. However, I believe our &s;trength is much the &s;ame as it was when the la&s;t was made, with the addition of nine militia regiments come from the &s;tate of Connecticut, averaging about three hundred and fifty men each. The&s;e are nine of the fourteen regiments mentioned in my letter of the nineteenth.&mdash;Our people &s;till conti|nue to be very &s;ickly.</P>
<P>The papers de&s;igned for the foreign troops have been put into &s;e|veral channels, in order that they might be conveyed to them; and, from the information I had ye&s;terday, I have rea&s;on to be|lieve many have fallen into their hands.</P>
<P>I have inclo&s;ed a copy of lord Drummonds &s;econd letter (in an&s;wer to mine) which I received &s;ince I tran&s;mitted his fir&s;t, and which I have thought nece&s;&s;ary to lay before Congre&s;s, that they may po&s;&s;e&s;s the whole of the core&s;pondence between us, and &s;ee how far he has exculpated him&s;elf from the charge alledged again&s;t him. The log-book he mentions to have &s;ent colonel Moy|lay proves nothing in his favor. That &s;hews that he had been at Bermuda, and from thence to &s;ome other i&s;land, on his pa&s;|&s;age from which to this place, the ve&s;&s;el he was in was boarded by a pilot who brought her into the Hook, where he found the Briti&s;h fleet, which his lord&s;hip avers he did not expect were there, having under&s;tood their de&s;tination was to the &s;outh|ward.</P>

<P>I THIS minute return from our lines on Long-I&s;land, where I left his excellency the general. From him I have it in command to inform Congre&s;s, that ye&s;terday he went there, and continued till evening, when from the enemy's having landed a con&s;iderable part of their forces,&mdash;and many of their movements,&mdash;there was rea&s;on to apprehend they would make in a little time a general attack.&mdash;As they would have a wood to pa&s;s through before they could approach the lines, it was thought expedient to place a number of men there on the dif|ferent

roads leading from where they were &s;tationed, in order to harra&s;s and annoy them in their march.&mdash;This being done, early this morning a &s;mart engagement en&s;ued between the enemy and our detachments, which, being unequal to the force they had to contend with, have &s;u&s;tained a pretty con&s;iderable lo&s;s: at lea&s;t many of our men are mi&s;&s;ing. Among tho&s;e that have not returned, are general Sullivan and lord Sterling. The enemy's lo&s;s is not known certainly: but we are told by &s;uch of our troops as were in the engagement and have come in that they had many killed and wounded.&mdash;Our party brought off a lieutenant, &s;erjeant and corporal, with twenty privates, pri|&s;oners.</P>
<P>While the&s;e detachments were engaged, a column of the enemy de&s;cended from the woods, and marched towards the centre of our lines with a de&s;ign to make an impre&s;&s;ion, but were repul&s;ed. This evening they appeared very numerous about the &s;kirts of the woods, where they have pitched &s;everal tents: and his excellency inclines to think they mean to attack and force us from our lines by way of regular approaches, rather than in any other manner.</P>
<P>To-day five &s;hips of the line came up towards the town, where they &s;eemed de&s;irous of getting, as they turned a long time again&s;t an unfavorable wind: and on my return this evening, I found a de&s;erter from the twenty-third regiment, who informed me that they de&s;ign as &s;oon as the wind will permit them to come up to give us a &s;evere cannonade, and to &s;ilence our batteries, if po&s;&s;i|ble.</P>

<P>I WAS la&s;t night honored with your favor of the twenty|&s;eventh, accompanied by &s;undry re&s;olutions of Congre&s;s. Tho&s;e re&s;pecting the officers, &amp;c. that may be wounded in the &s;ervice of the &s;tates, are founded much in ju&s;tice, and (I &s;hould hope) may be productive of many &s;alutary con&s;equences. As to the encouragement to the He&s;&s;ian officers, I wi&s;h it may have the de&s;ir|ed effect. Perhaps it might have been better, had the offer been &s;ooner made.</P>
<P>Before this you will probably have received a letter from Mr. Harri&s;on, of the twenty-&s;eventh, advi&s;ing of the engage|ment between a detachment of our men and the enemy on that

day.&mdash;I am &s;orry to inform Congre&s;s that I have not heard ei|ther of general Sullivan or lord Sterling, who (they would ob|&s;erve) were among the mi&s;&s;ing after the engagement; nor can I a&s;certain our lo&s;s. I am hopeful, part of our men will yet get in: &s;everal did ye&s;terday morning.&mdash;That of the enemy is al&s;o uncertain: the accounts are various. I incline to think they &s;uf|fered a good deal. Some de&s;erters &s;ay five hundred were killed and wounded.</P>
<P>There were &s;ome &s;kirmi&s;hing, the greate&s;t part of ye&s;terday, be|tween parties from the enemy and our people: in the evening it was pretty &s;mart. The event I have not yet learned.</P>
<P>The weather of late has been extremely wet. Ye&s;terday it rained &s;everely the whole afternoon, which di&s;tre&s;&s;ed our people much,&mdash;not having a &s;ufficiency of tents to cover them, and what we have, not being got over yet. I am in hopes they will all be got to day, and that they will be more comfortably pro|vided, though the great &s;carcity of the&s;e articles di&s;tre&s;&s;es us beyond mea&s;ure, not having any thing like a &s;ufficient number to protect our people from the inclemency of the weather:&mdash;which has occa&s;ioned much &s;ickne&s;s, and the men to be almo&s;t broken down.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>INCLINATION as well as duty would have induced me to give Congre&s;s the earlie&s;t information of my removal and that of the troops, from Long-I&s;land and its dependencies, to this city, the night before la&s;t: but the extreme fatigue which my|&s;elf and family have undergone, as much from the weather &s;ince as the engagement of the twenty-&s;eventh, rendered me and them entirely unfit to take pen in hand. Since monday, &s;carce any of us have been out of the lines till our pa&s;&s;age along the Ea&s;t-river was effected ye&s;terday morning; and for forty-eight hours preceding that I had hardly been off my hor&s;e, and never clo&s;ed my eyes: &s;o that I was quite unfit to write or dictate till this mor|ning.</P>
<P>Our retreat was made without any lo&s;s of men or ammuniti|on, and in better order than I expected from troops in the &s;itu|ation ours were. We brought off all our cannon and &s;tores, ex|cept a few heavy pieces, which in the condition the earth was by a long-continued rain, we found, upon trial, impracticable. The wheels of the carriages &s;inking up to the hobs, rendered it
<PB N="199" REF="031423_0198_0FEC5A9E0B611218">
impo&s;&s;ible for our whole force to drag them.&mdash;We left but little provi&s;ions on the i&s;land, except &s;ome cattle which had been driven within our lines, and which after many attempts to force acro&s;s the water, we found impo&s;&s;ible to effect, circum&s;tanced as we were.</P>
<P>I have inclo&s;ed a copy of the council of war held previ|ous to the retreat, to which I beg leave to refer Congre&s;s for the rea&s;ons, or many of them, that led to the adoption of that mea|&s;ure.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday evening and la&s;t night, a party of our men were em|ployed in bringing our &s;tores, cannon, tents, &amp;c. from Govern|or's-I&s;land, which they nearly completed. Some of the heavy cannon remain there &s;till, but (I expect) will be got away to-day.</P>
<P>In the engagement on the twenty-&s;eventh, generals Sullivan and Sterling were made pri&s;oners. The former has been per|mitted, on his parole, to return for a little time. From my lord Sterling I had a letter by general Sullivan (a copy of which I have the honor to tran&s;mit) that contains his forma|tion of the engagement with his brigade. It is not &s;o full and certain as I could wi&s;h:&mdash;he was hurried mo&s;t probably, as his letter was unfini&s;hed:&mdash;nor have I been yet able to obtain an ex|act account of our lo&s;s:&mdash;We &s;uppo&s;e it from &s;even hundred to a thou&s;and killed and taken.</P>
<P>General Sullivan &s;ays lord Howe is extremely de&s;irous of &s;eeing &s;ome members of Congre&s;s; for which purpo&s;e he was allowed to come out, and to communicate to them what has pa&s;&s;ed between him and his lord&s;hip. I have con&s;ented to his go|ing to Philadelphia, as I do not mean, or conceive it right, to withhold, or prevent him from giving, &s;uch information as he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es in this in&s;tance.</P>
<P>I am much hurried and engaged in arranging and making new di&s;po&s;itions of our forces; the movements of the enemy requiring them to be immediately had;&mdash;and therefore have only time to add, that I am, with my be&s;t regards to Congre&s;s, their and your mo&s;t obedient, &amp;c.</P>

<P>AS my intelligence of late has been rather unfavorable, and would be received with anxiety and concern, peculiarly hap|py &s;hould I e&s;teem my&s;elf, were it in my power at this time to tran&s;mit &s;uch information to Congre&s;s, as would be more plea&s;|ing
<PB N="200" REF="031423_0199_0FEC4795C3B6BEA0">
and agreeable to their wi&s;hes:&mdash;but, unfortunately for me,&mdash;unfortunately for them,&mdash;it is not.</P>
<P>Our &s;ituation is truly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing. The check our detachment &s;u&s;tained on the twenty-&s;eventh ultimo has di&s;pirited too great a proportion of our troops, and filled their minds with appre|hen&s;ion and de&s;pair. The militia, in&s;tead of calling forth their utmo&s;t efforts to a brave and manly oppo&s;ition in order to re|pair our lo&s;&s;es, are di&s;mayed, intractable, and impatient to re|turn. Great numbers of them have gone off,&mdash;in &s;ome in&s;tan|ces, almo&s;t by whole regiments, by half ones and by companies at a time. This circum&s;tance, of it&s;elf, independent of others, when fronted by a well appointed army &s;uperior in number to our whole collected force, would be &s;ufficiently di&s;agreeable:&mdash;but, when their example has infected another part of the army, when their want of di&s;cipline, and refu&s;al of almo&s;t every kind of re&s;traint and government, have produced a like conduct but too common to the whole, and an entire di&s;regard of that or|der and &s;ubordination nece&s;&s;ary to the well doing of an army, and which had been inculcated before, as well as the nature of our military e&s;tabli&s;hment would admit of,&mdash;our condition is &s;till more alarming: and with the deepe&s;t concern I am obliged to confe&s;s my want of confidence in the generality of the troops.</P>
<P>All the&s;e circum&s;tances fully confirm the opinion I ever en|tertained, and which I more than once in my letters took the liberty of mentioning to Congre&s;s, that no dependence could be put in a militia, or other troops than tho&s;e enli&s;ted and embo|died for a longer period than our regulations heretofore pre|&s;cribed. I am per&s;uaded, and as fully convinced as I am of any one fact that has happened, that our liberties mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be greatly hazarded if not entirely lo&s;t, if their defence is left to any but a permanent &s;tanding army,&mdash;I mean, one to exi&s;t during the war. Nor would the expen&s;e, incident to the &s;upport of &s;uch a body of troops as would be competent to almo&s;t every exigency, far exceed that which is daily incurred by calling in &s;uccour, and new enli&s;tments, which, when effected, are not attended with any good con&s;equences. Men who have been free, and &s;ubject to no controul, cannot be reduced to order in an in&s;tant: and the privileges and exemptions, they claim and will have, influence the conduct of others: and the aid derived from them is nearly counterbalanced by the di&s;order, irregularity, and confu&s;ion they occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I cannot find that the bounty of ten dollars is likely to pro|duce the de&s;ired effect. When men can get double that &s;um to
<PB N="201" REF="031423_0200_0FEC5AA3AF3F3700">
engage for a month or two in the militia, and that militia fre|quently called out, it is hardly to be expected.&mdash;The addition of land might have a con&s;iderable influence on a permanent en|li&s;tment.</P>
<P>Our number of men at pre&s;ent fit for duty is under twenty thou&s;and; they were &s;o by the la&s;t returns and be&s;t accounts I could get after the engagement on Long-I&s;land; &s;ince which, numbers have de&s;erted. I have ordered general Mercer to &s;end the men intended for the flying camp at this place, about a thou|&s;and in number, and to try with the militia, if practicable, to make a diver&s;ion on Staten-I&s;land.</P>
<P>Till of late, I had no doubt in my own mind, of defending this place; nor &s;hould I have yet, if the men would do their du|ty; but this I de&s;pair of. It is painful, and extremely grating to me, to give &s;uch unfavorable accounts; but it would be criminal to conceal the truth at &s;o critical a juncture. Every power I po&s;|&s;e&s;s &s;hall be exerted to &s;erve the cau&s;e; and my fir&s;t wi&s;h is, that whatever may be the event, the Congre&s;s will do me the ju&s;tice to think &s;o.</P>
<P>If we &s;hould be obliged to abandon the town, ought it to &s;tand as winter quarters for the enemy? They would derive great incon|veniences from it on the one hand; and much property would be de&s;troyed on the other.&mdash;It is an important que&s;tion, but will ad|mit of but little time for deliberation. At pre&s;ent I dare &s;ay the enemy mean to pre&s;erve it if they can. If Congre&s;s therefore &s;hould re&s;olve upon the de&s;truction of it, the re&s;olution &s;hould be a profound &s;ecret, as the knowledge of it will make a capital change in their plans.</P>

<P>SINCE I had the honor of addre&s;&s;ing you on the &s;econd, our affairs have not undergone a change for the better, nor a&s;&s;umed a more agreeable a&s;pect than what they then wore. The militia under various pretences, of &s;ickne&s;s, &amp;c. are daily dimini&s;hing; and in a little time, I am per&s;uaded, their number will be very in|con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>On monday night a forty-gun &s;hip pa&s;&s;ed up the &s;ound be|tween Governor's and Long-I&s;land, and anchored in Turtle-bay. In her pa&s;&s;age &s;he received a di&s;charge of cannon from our batte|ries, but without any damage; and having a favorable wind and tide, &s;oon got out of their reach. Ye&s;terday morning I

di&s;patched major Crane of the artillery, with two twelve pounders and a howitzer, to annoy her; who, hulling her &s;everal times, forced her from that &s;tation, and to take &s;helter behind an i&s;land, where &s;he &s;till continues. There are &s;everal other &s;hips of war in the Sound, with a good many tran&s;ports or &s;tore-&s;hips which came round Long-I&s;land, &s;o that the communication is entirely cut off. The admiral with the main body of the fleet, is clo&s;e in with Gov|ernor's-I&s;land.</P>
<P>Judging it expedient to guard again&s;t every contingency as far as our peculiar &s;ituation will admit, and that we may have re&s;ources left if obliged to abandon this place, I have &s;ent away and am re|moving above King&s;bridge all our &s;tores that are unnece&s;&s;ary, and that will not be immediately wanted.</P>
<P>I have enclo&s;ed &s;everal original letters from &s;ome of our officers pri&s;oners at Quebec, which fell into general Gate's hands, and were tran&s;mitted by him to general Schuyler who &s;ent them to me.

<P>The po&s;t-ma&s;ter having removed his office from the city to Dobb's-ferry, as it is &s;aid, makes it extremely inconvenient, and will be the means of my not giving &s;uch con&s;tant and regular intel|ligence as I could wi&s;h.&mdash;Cannot &s;ome mode be devi&s;ed, by which we may have a pretty con&s;tant and certain intercour&s;e and commu|nication kept up?

<P>I WAS la&s;t night honored with your favor of the third, with &s;undry re&s;olutions of Congre&s;s: and perceiving it to be their opin|ion and determination that no damage &s;hall be done the city in ca&s;e we are obliged to abandon it, I &s;hall take every mea&s;ure in my power to prevent it.</P>
<P>Since my letter on the fourth, nothing very material has occur|red, unle&s;s it is that the fleet &s;eem to be drawing more to|gether and all getting clo&s;e in with Governor's-I&s;land. Their de|&s;igns we cannot learn; nor have we been able to procure the lea&s;t information of late, of any of their plans or intended opera|tions.</P>
<P>As the enemy's movements are very different from what we ex|pected,&mdash;and from their large encampments a con&s;iderable di&s;|tance up the Sound, there is rea&s;on to believe they intend to make a landing above or below King&s;bridge, and thereby to hem in our army, and to cut off the communication with the coun|try,&mdash;I mean to call a council of general officers to-day or to-mor|row, and endeavor to dige&s;t and fix upon &s;ome regular and certain &s;y&s;tem of conduct to be pur&s;ued in order to baffle their efforts and counteract their &s;chemes; and al&s;o to determine of the expediency of evacuating or attempting to maintain the city and the &s;everal po&s;ts on this i&s;land. The re&s;ult of their opinion and deliberations I &s;hall advi&s;e Congre&s;s of by the earlie&s;t oppor|tunity, which will be by expre&s;s, having it not in my power to communicate any intelligence by po&s;t, as the office is removed to &s;o great a di&s;tance, and entirely out of the way.</P>
<P>I have inclo&s;ed a li&s;t of the officers who are pri&s;oners, and from whom letters have been received by a flag.&mdash;We know there are others not included in the li&s;t.</P>
<P>General Sullivan having informed me that general Howe was willing that an exchange of him for general Pre&s;cot &s;hould take place, it will be proper to &s;end general Pre&s;cot immediately, that it may be effected.</P>
<P>As the militia regiments in all probability will be impatient to return, and become pre&s;&s;ing for their pay, I &s;hall be glad of the di|rection of Congre&s;s, whether they are to receive it here or from the conventions or a&s;&s;emblies of the re&s;pective &s;tates to which they belong. On the one hand, the &s;ettlement of their ab|&s;tracts will be attended with trouble and difficulty: on the other, they will go away much better &s;atisfied, and be more ready to give their aid in future, if they are paid before their de|parture.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="031423_0203_0FEC5AAD032E29C8">
Before I conclude, I mu&s;t take the liberty of mentioning to Congre&s;s the great di&s;tre&s;s we are in for want of money. Two months pay (and more to &s;ome battalions) is now due the troops here, without any thing in the military che&s;t to &s;atisfy it.

<P>THIS will be delivered you by captain Martindale and lieu|tenant Turner, who were taken la&s;t fall in the armed brig Wa&s;hington, and who, with Mr. Childs the &s;econd lieutenant, have lately effected their e&s;cape from Halifax. Captain Martin|dale and the&s;e two officers have applied to me for pay from the fir&s;t of January till this time: but, not conceiving my&s;elf au|thori&s;ed to grant it, however rea&s;onable it may be, as they were only engaged till the la&s;t of December,&mdash;at their in&s;tance I have mentioned the matter to Congre&s;s, and &s;ubmit their ca&s;e to their con&s;ideration.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I had the honor of addre&s;&s;ing you on the &s;ixth in&s;tant, I have called a council of the general officers, in order to take a full and comprehen&s;ive view of our &s;ituation, and thereupon form &s;uch a plan of future defence as may be immediately pur&s;ued, and &s;ubject to no other alteration than a change of operations on the enemy's &s;ide may occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Before the landing of the enemy on Long-I&s;land, the point of attack could not be known, or any &s;atisfactory judgment formed of their intentions. It might be on Long-I&s;land, on Bergen, or directly on the city. This made it nece&s;&s;ary to be prepared for each, and has occa&s;ioned an expen&s;e of labor which now &s;eems u&s;ele&s;s, and is regretted by tho&s;e who form a judg|ment from after knowledge. But I tru&s;t, men of di&s;ernment will think differently, and &s;ee that by &s;uch works and preparations we have not only delayed the operations of the campaign till it is too late to effect any capital incur&s;ion into the country, but have drawn the enemy's forces to one point and obliged them to [<HI>di&s;clo&s;e</HI>] their plan, &s;o as to enable us to form our defence on &s;ome certainty.</P>
<P>It is now extremely obvious from all intelligence,&mdash;from their movements, and every other circum&s;tance,&mdash;that having landed their whole army on Long-I&s;land (except about four thou&s;and on Staten-I&s;land), they mean to inclo&s;e us on the i&s;land of New-York by taking po&s;t in our rear while the &s;hipping effectually &s;ecure the front; and thus, either by cutting off our communica|tion with the country, oblige us to fight them on their own terms, or &s;urrender at di&s;cretion,&mdash;or by a brilliant &s;troke en|deavor to cut this army in pieces, and &s;ecure the collection of arms and &s;tores, which they well know we &s;hall not be able &s;oon to replace.</P>
<P>Having therefore their &s;y&s;tem unfolded to us, it became an im|portant con&s;ideration how it could be mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sfully oppo&s;ed. On every &s;ide there is a choice of difficulties: and every mea|&s;ure on our part (however painful the reflection is from experi|ence) to be formed with &s;ome apprehen&s;ion that all our troops will not do their duty. In deliberating on this great que&s;tion, it was impo&s;&s;ible to forget, that hi&s;tory, our own experience, the advice of our able&s;t friends in Europe, the fears of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|my, and even the declarations of Congre&s;s, demon&s;trate, that on our &s;ide the war &s;hould be defen&s;ive&mdash;(it has ever been called a war of po&s;ts);&mdash;that we &s;hould on all occa&s;ions avoid a gene|ral
<PB N="206" REF="031423_0205_0FEC5AB5A418B130">
action, nor put any thing to the ri&s;k, unle&s;s compelled by a nece&s;&s;ity into which we ought never to be drawn.</P>
<P>The arguments on which &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem was founded were deemed unan&s;werable; and experience has given her &s;anction. With the&s;e views and being fully per&s;uaded that it would be pre&s;umption to draw out her young troops into open ground a|gain&s;t their &s;uperiors both in number and di&s;cipline, I have ne|ver &s;pared the &s;pade and pickaxe. I confe&s;s I have not found that readine&s;s to defend even &s;trong po&s;ts at all hazards, which is nece&s;&s;ary to derive the greate&s;t benefit from them. The ho|nor of making a brave defence does not &s;eem to be a &s;ufficient &s;timulus when &s;ucce&s;s is very doubtful, and the falling into the enemy's hands probable: but I doubt not, this will be gradual|ly attained.&mdash;We are now in a &s;trong po&s;t, but not an impreg|nable one, nay, acknowledged by every man of judgment to be untenable, unle&s;s the enemy will make the attack upon lines when they can avoid it, and their movements indicate that they mean to do &s;o.</P>
<P>To draw the whole army together in order to arrange the defence proportionate to the extent of lines and works, would leave the country open for an approach, and put the fate of this army and its &s;tores on the hazard of making a &s;ucce&s;sful defence in the city, or the i&s;&s;ue of an engagement out of it. On the o|ther hand, to abandon a city which has been by &s;ome deemed defen&s;ible, and on who&s;e works much labor has been be&s;towed, has a tendency to di&s;pirit the troops and enfeeble our cau&s;e. It has al&s;o been con&s;idered as the key to the northern country. But as to that, I am fully of opinion that the e&s;tabli&s;hing of &s;trong po&s;ts at Mount-Wa&s;hington on the upper part of this i&s;land, and on the Jer&s;ey &s;ide oppo&s;ite to it, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the ob&s;truction already made (and which may be improved) in the water, not only the navigation of Hud&s;on's river, but an ea&s;ier and better communication may be effectually &s;ecured between the northern and &s;outhern &s;tates. This, I believe, every one acquainted with the &s;ituation of the country will readily agree to: and it will appear evident to tho&s;e who have an opportunity of recurring to good maps.</P>
<P>The&s;e and many other con&s;equences, which will be involved in the determination of our next mea&s;ure, have given our minds full employ, and led every one to form a judgment as various objects pre&s;ented them&s;elves to his view.</P>
<P>The po&s;t at King&s;bridge is naturally &s;trong, and is pretty well fortified: the heights about it are commanding, and might &s;oon be made more &s;o. The&s;e are important objects, and I have at|tended
<PB N="207" REF="031423_0206_0FEC5AB8F26AB530">
to them accordingly. I have al&s;o removed from the city all the &s;tore and ammunition except what was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for its defence, and made every other di&s;po&s;ition that did not e&s;|&s;entially interfere with the object,&mdash;carefully keeping in view, until it &s;hould be ab&s;olutely determined on full con&s;ideration, how far the city was to be defended at all events.</P>
<P>In re&s;olving points of &s;uch importance, many circum&s;tances peculiar to our own army al&s;o occur. Being only provided for a &s;ummer's campaign, their clothes, &s;hoes, and blankets, will &s;oon be unfit for the change of weather which we every day feel. At pre&s;ent we have not tents for more than two-thirds, many of them old and worn out: but if we had a plentiful &s;upply, the &s;ea|&s;on will not admit of continuing in them long.&mdash;The ca&s;e of our &s;ick is al&s;o worthy of much con&s;ideration. Their number, by the returns, forms at lea&s;t one-fourth of the army. Policy and humanity require they &s;hould be made as comfortable as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>With the&s;e, and many other circum&s;tances before them, the whole council of general officers met ye&s;terday in order to adopt &s;ome general line of conduct to be pur&s;ued at this important cri&s;is. I intended to have procured their &s;eparate opinions on each point; but time would not admit. I was therefore obliged to collect their &s;en&s;e more generally than I could have wi&s;hed.&mdash;All agreed the town would not be tenable if the enemy re&s;olved to bombard and cannonade it; but the difficulty attending a removal operated &s;o &s;trongly, that a cour&s;e was taken between abandoning it totally and concentring our whole &s;trength for its defence: nor were &s;ome a little influenced in their opinions to whom the determination of Congre&s;s was known, again&s;t an evacuation totally, as they were led to &s;u&s;pect Congre&s;s wi&s;hed it to be maintained at every hazard.</P>
<P>It was concluded to arrange the army under three divi&s;ions;&mdash;five thou&s;and to remain for the defence of the city;&mdash;nine thou&s;and to King&s;bridge and its dependencies, as well to po&s;&s;e&s;s and &s;ecure tho&s;e po&s;ts, as to be ready to attack the enemy who are moving ea&s;tward on Long-I&s;land, if they &s;hould attempt to land on this &s;ide;&mdash;the remainder to occupy the intermediate &s;pace, and &s;upport either;&mdash;that the &s;ick &s;hould be immediately removed to Orange-town, and barracks prepared at King&s;bridge with all expedition to cover the troops.</P>
<P>There were &s;ome general officers, in who&s;e judgment and opi|nion much confidence is to be repo&s;ed, that were for a total and immediate removal from the city;&mdash;urging the great danger of one part of the army being cut off before the other can &s;upport
<PB N="208" REF="031423_0207_0FEC5ABA8F379588">
it, the extremities being at lea&s;t &s;ixteen miles apart;&mdash;that our army, when collected, is inferior to the enemy;&mdash;that they can move with their whole force to any point of attack, and con|&s;equently mu&s;t &s;ucceed by weight of numbers, if they have on|ly a part to oppo&s;e them;&mdash;that, by removing from hence, we deprive the enemy of the advantage of their &s;hips, which will make at lea&s;t one half of the force to attack the town;&mdash;that we &s;hould keep the enemy at bay, put nothing to the hazard, but at all events keep the army together, which may be recruited another year;&mdash;that the un&s;pent &s;tores will al&s;o be pre&s;erved; and, in this ca&s;e, the heavy artillery can al&s;o be &s;ecured. But they were over|ruled by a majority, who thought for the pre&s;ent a part of our force might be kept here, and attempt to maintain the city a while longer.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible a retreating army is incircled with difficulties: that the declining an engagement &s;ubjects a general to reproach; and that the common cau&s;e may be affected by the di&s;courage|ment it may throw over the minds of many. Nor am I in&s;en&s;ible of the contrary effects, if a brilliant &s;troke could be made with any probability of &s;ucce&s;s, e&s;pecially after our lo&s;s upon Long|I&s;land. But, when the fate of America may be at &s;take on the i&s;&s;ue,&mdash;when the wi&s;dom of cooler moments and experienced men have decided that we &s;hould protract the war, if po&s;&s;ible,&mdash;I can|not think it &s;afe or wi&s;e to adopt a different &s;y&s;tem when the &s;ea&s;on for action draws &s;o near a clo&s;e.</P>
<P>That the enemy mean to winter in New-York, there can be no doubt:&mdash;that, with &s;uch an armament they can drive us out, is equally clear.&mdash;The Congre&s;s having re&s;olved that it &s;hould not be de&s;troyed, nothing &s;eems to remain, but to determine the time of their taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. It is our intere&s;t and wi&s;h to prolong it as much as po&s;&s;ible, provided the delay does not affect our future mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>The militia of Connecticut is reduced, from &s;ix thou&s;and, to le&s;s than two thou&s;and, and in a few days will be merely nominal. The arrival of &s;ome Maryland troops, &amp;c. from the flying camp, has in a great degree &s;upplied the lo&s;s of men: but the ammunition they have carried away will be a lo&s;s &s;en&s;ibly felt. The impul&s;e for going home was &s;o irre&s;i&s;tible, it an&s;wered no purpo&s;e to oppo&s;e it. Though I would not di&s;charge, I have been obliged to ac|quie&s;ce; and it affords me more melancholy proof, how delu&s;ive &s;uch dependencies are.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed I have the honor to tran&s;mit a general return, the fir&s;t I have been able to procure for &s;ome time; al&s;o a report of captain Newell from our works at Horn's hook or Hell|gate.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS ye&s;terday honored with your favor of the eighth in&s;tant, accompanied by &s;everal re&s;olutions of Congre&s;s, to which I &s;hall pay the &s;tricte&s;t attention, and, in the in&s;tances required, make them the future rule of my conduct.</P>
<P>The mode of negociation pur&s;ued by lord Howe I did not approve of: but as general Sullivan was &s;ent out upon the bu|&s;ine&s;s, and with a me&s;&s;age to Congre&s;s, I could not conceive my&s;elf at liberty to interfere in the matter, as he was in the character of a pri&s;oner, and totally &s;ubject to their power and direction.</P>
<P>The li&s;t of pri&s;oners, before omitted through hurry, is now inclo&s;ed; though it will probably have reached Congre&s;s before this.&mdash;I &s;hall write by the fir&s;t opportunity for major Haw&s;ak&s;e to repair to Philadelphia&mdash;(he is in the northern army);&mdash;and will al&s;o mention the &s;everal appointments in con&s;equence of colonel St. Clair's promotion.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as generals Pre&s;cot and M'Donald arrive, I &s;hall take mea&s;ures to advi&s;e general Howe of it, that the propo&s;ed ex|change for general Sullivan and lord Sterling may be carried into execution.</P>
<P>Since my letter of the eighth, nothing material has occurred, except that the enemy have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of Monte|zore's-I&s;land, and landed a con&s;iderable number of troops upon it. This i&s;land lies in the mouth of Hearlem-river, which runs out of the Sound into the North-river, and will give the ene|my an ea&s;y opportunity of landing either on the low grounds of Morri&s;ania, if their views are to &s;eize and po&s;&s;e&s;s the pa&s;&s;es above King&s;bridge, or on the plains of Haerlem, if they de&s;ign to intercept and cut off the communication between our &s;everal po&s;ts. I am making every di&s;po&s;ition and arrangement that the divided &s;tate of our troops will admit of, and which appear mo&s;t likely and the be&s;t calculated to oppo&s;e their attacks; for I pre&s;ume there will be &s;everal.&mdash;How the event will be, God only knows; but you may be a&s;&s;ured that nothing in my power,
<PB N="210" REF="031423_0209_0FEC5ABE2E94BA78">
circum&s;tanced as I am, &s;hall be wanting, to effect a favorable and happy i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>By my letter of the eighth you would perceive that &s;everal of the council were for holding the town, conceiving it practi|cable for &s;ome time. Many of them now, upon &s;eeing our di|vided &s;tate, have altered their opinion, and allow the expedi|ency and nece&s;&s;ity of concentring our whole force, or draw|ing it more together. Convinced of the propriety of this mea|&s;ure, I am ordering our &s;tores away, except &s;uch as may be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to keep as long as our troops remain; that, if an evacuation of the city becomes inevitable (which certainly mu&s;t be the ca&s;e), there may be as little to remove as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The inclo&s;ed packet contains &s;everal letters for particular mem|bers of Congre&s;s and for &s;ome gentlemen in Philadelphia. They came to hand ye&s;terday, and were brought from France by a captain Levez lately arrived at Bedford in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts &s;tate. I mu&s;t reque&s;t the favor of you to open the packet, and to have the letters put in a proper channel of conveyance to the gentlemen they are addre&s;&s;ed to.</P>

<P>La&s;t evening the enemy tran&s;ported a number of men from Buchanan's to Montezore's i&s;land, and by their &s;everal move|ments, more &s;trongly indicate their intention to land &s;omewhere about Haerlem or Morri&s;ania,&mdash;mo&s;t likely, at both at the &s;ame time. This morning one of the &s;hips that have been for &s;ome time in the Sound moved down towards Hell-gate; but, the tide leaving her, &s;he could not get near enough to bring her guns to bear upon our fortification. If &s;he means to attack it, it is probable &s;he will warp in the next tide. Their batte|ries have kept up a pretty con&s;tant fire again&s;t ours at that place, but without any con&s;iderable effect. This morning they opened a new one.</P>

<P>I HAVE been duly honored with your favor of the tenth, with the re&s;olution of Congre&s;s which accompanied it, and thank them for the confidence they repo&s;e in my judgment re|&s;pecting the evacuation of the city. I could wi&s;h to maintain it, becau&s;e I know it to be of importance; but I am fully con|vinced that it cannot be done, and that an attempt for that purpo&s;e, if per&s;evered in, might and mo&s;t certainly would be attended with con&s;equences the mo&s;t fatal and alarming in their nature.</P>
<P>Sen&s;ible of this, &s;everal of the general officers, &s;ince the de|termination of the council mentioned in my la&s;t, petitioned that a &s;econd council might be called to recon&s;ider the propo&s;itions which had been before them upon the &s;ubject. Accordingly I called one on the twelfth, when a large majority not only de|termined a removal of the army prudent, but ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary,&mdash;declaring they were entirely convinced from a full and minute enquiry into our &s;ituation, that it was extremely peril|ous; and, from every movement of the enemy, and the intel|ligence received, their plan of operations was to get in our rear, and, by cutting off the communication with the main, ob|lige us to force a pa&s;&s;age through them on the terms they wi&s;h, or to become pri&s;oners in &s;ome &s;hort time for want of nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies of provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>We are now taking every method in our power to remove the &s;tores, &amp;c. in which we find almo&s;t in&s;uperable difficulties. They are &s;o great and &s;o numerous, that I fear we &s;hall not ef|fect the whole before we meet with &s;ome interruption.&mdash;I fully expected that an attack &s;omewhere would have been made la&s;t night. In that I was di&s;appointed; and happy &s;hall I be, if my apprehen&s;ions of one to-night, or in a day or two, are not confirmed by the event. If it is deferred a little while longer, I flatter my&s;elf all will be got away, and our force be more concentred, and of cour&s;e more likely to re&s;i&s;t them with &s;uc|ce&s;s.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday afternoon, four &s;hips of war, two of forty and two of twenty-eight guns went up the Ea&s;t-river, pa&s;&s;ing between Governor's and Long-I&s;land, and anchored about a mile above the city, oppo&s;ite Mr. Srivan&s;ent's, where the Ro&s;e man-of-war was lying before. The de&s;ign of their going not being certainly known, gives ri&s;e to various conjectures,&mdash;&s;ome &s;up|po&s;ing they are to cover the landing of a party of the enemy a|bove the city,&mdash;others that they are to a&s;&s;i&s;t in de&s;troying our
<PB N="212" REF="031423_0211_0FEC5AC89291E800">
battery at Horn's-hook, that they may have a free and un-in|terrupted navigation in the Sound. It is an object of great im|portance to them, and what they are indu&s;triou&s;ly trying to ef|fect by a pretry con&s;tant cannonade and bombardment.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I would beg leave to mention to Con|gre&s;s, that the pay now allowed to nur&s;es for their attendance on the &s;ick is by no means adequate to their &s;ervices; the con|&s;equence of which is, that they are extremely difficult to procure; in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ed they are not to be got; and we are under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ub&s;tituting in their place a number of men from the re&s;pective regiments, who&s;e &s;ervice by that means is entirely lo&s;t in the proper line of their duty, and but little benefit rendered to the &s;ick. The officers I have talked with upon the &s;ubject all agree that they &s;hould be allowed a dollar per week, and that for le&s;s they cannot be had.</P>
<P>Our &s;ick are extremely numerous, and we find their removal attended with the greate&s;t difficulty. It is a matter that em|ploys much of our time and care; and what makes it more di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing is the want of proper and convenient places for their reception.&mdash;I fear their &s;ufferings will be great and many. How|ever, nothing on my part, that humanity or policy can require, &s;hall be wanting to make them comfortable, &s;o far as the &s;tate of things will admit of.</P>

Three &s;hips of war came up the North-river as high as Bloomingdale, which put a total &s;top to the removal, by water, of any more of our provi&s;ion, &amp;c. and about eleven o'clock tho&s;e in the Ea&s;t-river began a mo&s;t &s;evere and heavy cannonade, to &s;cour the grounds, and cover the landing of their troops between Turtle-bay and the city, where brea&s;t works had been thrown up to oppo&s;e them.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I heard the &s;iring, I rode with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch towards the place of landing, when, to my great &s;urpri&s;e and mor|tification, I found the troops that had been po&s;ted in the lines retreating with the utmo&s;t precipitation, and tho&s;e ordered to &s;upport them (Par&s;ons and Fellows's brigades) flying in every direction, and in the greate&s;t confu&s;ion, notwith&s;tanding the exertions of the generals to form them. I u&s;ed every means in my power to rally and get them into &s;ome order: but my at|tempts were fruitle&s;s and ineffectual; and on the appearance of a &s;mall party of the enemy, not more than &s;ixty or &s;eventy, their di&s;order increa&s;ed, and they ran away in the greate&s;t confu&s;ion, without firing a &s;ingle &s;hot.</P>
<P>Finding that no confidence was to be placed in the&s;e brigades, and apprehending that another party of the enemy might pa&s;s over to Haerlem plains and cut off the retreat to this place, I &s;ent orders to &s;ecure the heights in the be&s;t manner with the troops that were &s;tationed on and near them; which being done, the retreat was effected with but little or no lo&s;s of men, though of a con&s;iderable part of our baggage,&mdash;occa&s;ioned by this di&s;graceful and da&s;tardly conduct, Mo&s;t of our heavy cannon, and a part of our &s;tores and provi&s;ions which we were about removing, was unavoidably left in the city, though every means (after it had been determined in council to evacuate the po&s;t) had been u&s;ed to prevent it.</P>
<P>We are now encamped with the main body of the army on the heights of Haerlem, where I &s;hould hope the enemy would meet with a defeat in ca&s;e of an attack, if the generality of our troops would behave with tolerable bravery. But experience, to my extreme affliction, has convinced me that this is rather to be wi&s;hed for than expected. However, I tru&s;t that there are many who will act like men, and &s;hew them&s;elves worthy of the ble&s;&s;ings of freedom.</P>
<P>I have &s;ent out &s;ome reconnoitring parties to gain intelligence, if po&s;&s;ible, of the di&s;po&s;ition of the enemy, and &s;hall inform Con|gre&s;s of every material event by the earlie&s;t opportunity.&mdash;I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS my letter of the &s;ixteenth contained intelligence of an im|portant nature, and &s;uch as might lead Congre&s;s to expect that the evacuation of New-York and retreat to the heights of Haer|lem, in the manner they were made, would be &s;ucceeded by &s;ome other intere&s;ting event, I beg leave to inform them that as yet nothing has been attempted upon a large and general plan of attack.</P>
<P>About the time of the po&s;t's departure with my letter, the ene|my appeared in &s;everal large bodies upon the plains about two and a half miles from hence. I rode down to our advanced po&s;ts, to put matters in a proper &s;ituation if they &s;hould attempt to come on, When I arrived there I heard a firing, which, I was informed, was between a party of our rangers under the command of lieutenant-colonel Knolton, and an advanced party of the enemy. Our men came in and told me that the body of the enemy, who kept them&s;elves concealed, con&s;i&s;ted of a|bout three hundred as near as they could gue&s;s, I immedi|ately ordered three companies of colonels Weedon's regiment from Virginia, under the command of major Leitch, and colonel Knol|ton with his rangers compo&s;ed of volunteers from different New-England regiments, to try to get in their rear, while a di&s;po&s;ition was making as if to attack them in front, and thereby draw their whole attention that way.</P>
<P>This took effect as I wi&s;hed on the part of the enemy. On the appearance of our party in front, they immediately ran down the hill, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome fences and bu&s;hes, and a &s;mart firing began, but at too great a di&s;tance to do much execution on either &s;ide. The parties under colonel Knolton and major Leitch unluc|kily began their attack too &s;oon, as it was rather in flank than in rear.&mdash;In a little time major Leitch was brought off wounded, having received three balls through his &s;ide; and, in a &s;hort time after, colonel Knolton got a wound which proved mortal. Their men, however, per&s;evered, and continued the engagement with the greate&s;t re&s;olution.</P>
<P>Finding that they wanted a &s;upport, I advanced part of colonel Griffith's and colonel Richard&s;ons's Maryland regiments, with &s;ome detachments from the ea&s;tern regiments who were near|e&s;t the place of action. The&s;e troops charged the enemy with great intrepidity, and drove them from the wood into the plain, and were pu&s;hing them from thence (having &s;ilenced
<PB N="215" REF="031423_0214_0FEC5AD2D0E804A8">
their fire in a great mea&s;ure) when I judged it prndent to order a retreat, fearing the enemy (as I have &s;ince found was really the ca&s;e) were &s;ending a large body to &s;upport their party.</P>
<P>Major Leitch, I am in hopes, will recover: but colonel Knol|ton's fall is much to be regretted, as that of a brave and good offi|cer.&mdash;We had about forty wounded: the number of &s;lain is not yet a&s;certained: but it is very incon&s;iderable.</P>
<P>By a &s;erjeant who de&s;erted from the enemy and came in this morning, I find that their party was greater than I imagined. It con&s;i&s;ted of the &s;econd battalion of light infantry, a battalion of the Royal Highlanders, and three companies of He&s;&s;ian ri|flemen, under the command of brigadier-general Le&s;lie. The de&s;erter reports that their lo&s;s in wounded and mi&s;&s;ing was eighty-nine, and eight killed. In the latter, his account is too &s;mall, as our people di&s;covered and buried double that number. This affair, I am in hopes, will be attended with many &s;alutary con&s;equences, as it &s;eems to have greatly in&s;pired the whole of our troops.&mdash;The &s;erjeant further adds that a con&s;iderable body of men are now encamped from the Ea&s;t to the North river, between the &s;even and eight mile &s;tones, under the command of general Clinton.&mdash;General Howe, he believes, has his quarters at Mr. Apthorp's hou&s;e.</P>

<P>SINCE I had the honor of addre&s;&s;ing you ye&s;terday, nothing material has occurred. However, it is probable in a little time the enemy will attempt to force us from hence, as we are informed they are bringing many of their heavy cannon to|wards the the heights and the works we have thrown up. They have al&s;o eight or nine &s;hips of war in the North-river, which

(it is &s;aid) are to cannonade our right flank when they open their batteries again&s;t our front. Every di&s;po&s;ition is making on our part for defence: and Congre&s;s may be a&s;&s;ured that I &s;hall do eve|ry thing in my power to maintain the po&s;t &s;o long as it &s;hall appear practicable, and conducive to the general good.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been honored with your favor of the &s;ixteenth with its inclo&s;ures.&mdash;To prevent the injury and abu&s;es which would ari&s;e from the militia and other troops carrying away ammunition and continental property, I have publi&s;hed the &s;ub&s;tance of the re&s;olves upon the &s;ubject in general orders.</P>
<P>Since my letter of ye&s;terday, nothing of importance has ca&s;t up. The enemy are forming a large and exten&s;ive encampment in the plains mentioned in my la&s;t, and are bu&s;ily employed in tran&s;port|ing their cannon and &s;tores from Long-I&s;land. As they advance them this way, we may rea&s;onably expect their operations will not long be deferred.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed are &s;undry letters, &amp;c. to which Congre&s;s will be plea&s;|ed to pay &s;uch regard as they may think them de&s;erving of. The letter from mon&s;ieur . . . . . came open under cover of one to me.&mdash;Tho&s;e from colonel Hand and colonel Ward con|tain a li&s;t of vacancies in their regiments, and of the per&s;ons they e&s;teem proper to fill them. The former, I believe, returned no li&s;t before: the latter &s;ays he never got any commi&s;&s;ions.&mdash;Generals Howe and Er&s;kine's proclamation &s;hew the mea&s;ures that have been pur&s;ued, to force and &s;educe the inhabitants of Long|I&s;land from their allegiance to the &s;tates, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t in their de&s;|truction.</P>
<P>As the period will &s;oon arrive, when the troops compo&s;ing the pre&s;ent army (a few excepted) will be di&s;banded according to the tenor of their enli&s;tments, and the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equen|ces may cau&s;e if a &s;uitable and timely provi&s;ion is not made in this in&s;tance, I take the liberty of &s;ugge&s;ting to Congre&s;s not on|ly the expediency but the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity there is that their earlie&s;t attention &s;hould be had to this &s;ubject. In re&s;pect to the time that troops &s;hould be engaged for, I have frequently given my &s;entiments; nor have I omitted to expre&s;s my opinion of the difficulties that will attend rai&s;ing them, nor of the
<PB N="217" REF="031423_0216_0FEC5ADD311EA178">
impracticability of effecting it without the allowance of a large and extraordinary bounty.</P>
<P>It is a melancholy and painful con&s;ideration to tho&s;e who are concerned in the work and have the command, to be forming ar|mies con&s;tantly, and to be left by troops ju&s;t when they begin to de&s;erve the name, or perhaps at a moment when an impor|tant blow is expected. This, I am informed, will be the ca&s;e at Tyconderoga, with part of the troops there, unle&s;s &s;ome &s;y&s;tem is immediately come into, by which they can be induced to &s;tay. General Schuyler tells me in a letter received ye&s;terday, that De Haas's, Maxwell's, and Wind's Regiments &s;tand en|gaged only till the beginning of next month, and that the men, he is fearful, will not remain longer than the time of their enli&s;tments.</P>
<P>I would al&s;o beg leave to mention to Congre&s;s, that the &s;ea&s;on is fa&s;t approaching when clothes of every kind will be wanted for the army. Their di&s;tre&s;s is already great, and will be increa&s;ed as the weather becomes more &s;evere. Our &s;ituation is now bad, but it is much better than that of the militia that are coming to join us from the &s;tates of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay and Connecticut, in con&s;equence of the requi&s;ition of Congre&s;s. They, I am informed, have not a &s;ingle tent, or a nece&s;&s;ary of any kind; nor can I conceive how it will be po&s;&s;ible to &s;upport them. The&s;e circum&s;tances are extremely alarming, and oblige me to wi&s;h Congre&s;s to have all the tents, cloathing of ev|ery kind, and camp nece&s;&s;aries, provided and forwarded, that are to be procured. The&s;e ea&s;tern reinforcements have not a &s;ingle nece&s;&s;ary, not a pan or a kettle,&mdash;in which we are now greatly deficient.&mdash;It is with reluctance that I trouble Congre&s;s with the&s;e matters: but to whom can I re&s;ort for relief unle&s;s to them? The nece&s;&s;ity therefore, which urges the application, will excu&s;e it, I am per&s;uaded.</P>
<P>I have not been able to tran&s;mit Congre&s;s a general return of the army this week, owing to the peculiar &s;ituation of our af|fairs, and the great &s;hifting and changing among the troops. As &s;oon as I can procure one, a copy &s;hall be forwarded to Congre&s;s.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FROM the hours alloted to &s;leep I will borrow a few mo|ments to convey my thoughts on &s;undry important matters to Con|gre&s;s. I &s;hall offer them with the &s;incerity which ought to cha|racterize a man of candor, and with the freedom which may be u&s;ed in giving u&s;eful information without incurring the imputation of pre&s;umption.</P>
<P>We are now, as it were, upon the eve of another di&s;&s;olution of our army. The remembrance of the difficulties which happened upon the occa&s;ion la&s;t year,&mdash;the con&s;equences which might have followed the change if proper advantages had been ta|ken by the enemy,&mdash;added to a knowledge of the pre&s;ent temper and &s;ituation of the troops,&mdash;reflect but a very gloo|my pro&s;pect upon the appearances of things now, and &s;atisfy me beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of doubt, that, unle&s;s &s;ome &s;peedy and ef|fectual mea&s;ures are adopted by Congre&s;s, our cau&s;e will be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>It is in vain to expect that any or more than a trifling part of this army will again engage in the &s;ervice on the encouragement offered by Congre&s;s. When men find that their town&s;men and companions are receiving twenty, thirty, and more dol|lars, for a few months' &s;ervice (which is truly the ca&s;e), it cannot be expected, without u&s;ing compul&s;ion: and to force them into the &s;ervice would an&s;wer no valuable purpo&s;e. When men are irrita|ted, and the pa&s;&s;ions inflamed, they fly ha&s;tily and cheerful|ly to arms: but after the fir&s;t emotions are over * * *, a &s;oldier, rea&s;oned with upon the goodne&s;s of the cau&s;e he is engaged in and the ine&s;timable rights he is contending for, hears you with patience, and acknowledges the truth of your ob&s;erva|tions, but adds that it is of no more importance to him than others. The officer makes you the &s;ame reply, with this further remark, that his pay will not &s;upport him, and he cannot ruin him&s;elf and family to &s;erve his country, when every member of the community is equally intere&s;ted, and benefitted by his la|bors. * * *</P>
<P>It becomes evidently clear then, that, as this conte&s;t is not likely to be the work of a day, as the war mu&s;t be carried on &s;y&s;|tematically,&mdash;and to do it you mu&s;t have good officers,&mdash;there are, in my judgment, no other po&s;&s;ible means to obtain them but by e&s;tabli&s;hing your army upon a permanent footing, and giving your officers good pay. This will induce gentlemen and
<PB N="220" REF="031423_0219_0FEC5AE8180B2E90">
men of character to engage: and till the bulk of your officers are compo&s;ed of &s;uch per&s;ons as are actuated by principles of honor and a &s;pirit of enterpri&s;e, you have little to expect from them. They ought to have &s;uch allowances as will enable them to live like and &s;upport the character of gentleman. * * * Be&s;ides &s;omething is due to a man who puts his life in [<HI>your</HI>] hands, hazards his health, and for&s;akes the &s;weets of do|me&s;tic enjoyment.&mdash;Why a captain in the continental &s;ervice &s;hould receive no more than five &s;hillings currency per day for per|forming the &s;ame duties that an officer of the &s;ame rank in the Briti&s;h &s;ervice receives ten &s;hillings &s;terling for, I never could conceive, e&s;pecially when the latter is provided with every nece&s;&s;ary he requires upon the be&s;t terms, and the former can &s;carce procure them at any rate. There is nothing that gives a man con&s;equence and renders him fit for command, like a &s;up|port that renders him independent of every body but the &s;tate he &s;erves.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the men, nothing but a good bounty can obtain them upon a permanent e&s;tabli&s;hment: and for no &s;horter time than the continuance of the war, ought they to be engaged; as facts inconte&s;tibly prove that the difficulty and co&s;t of en|li&s;tments increa&s;e with time.&mdash;When the army was fir&s;t rai&s;|ed at Cambridge, I am per&s;uaded the men might have been got, without a bounty for the war. After this, they began to &s;ee that the conte&s;t was not likely to end &s;o &s;peedily as was imagined, and to feel their con&s;equence by remarking, that, to get in the mili|tia in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t year, many towns were induced to give them a bounty.</P>
<P>Fore&s;eeing the evils re&s;ulting from this, and the de&s;tructive con&s;equences which unavoidably would follow &s;hort enli&s;tments, I took the liberty in a long letter (date not now recollected, as my letter-book is not here) to recommend the enli&s;tments for and during the war, a&s;&s;igning &s;uch rea&s;ons for it as experience has &s;ince convinced me were well founded. At that time, twen|ty dollars would, I am per&s;uaded, have engaged the men for this term. But it would not do to look back: and, if the pre&s;ent opportunity is &s;lipped, I am per&s;uaded that twelve months more will increa&s;e our difficulties four-fold. I &s;hall therefore take the freedom of giving it as my opinion, that a good bounty be immediately offered, aided by the proffer of at lea&s;t a hundred or a hundred and fifty acres of land, and a &s;uit of clothes and blanket to each non-commi&s;&s;ioned officer and &s;oldier; as I have good athority for &s;aying, that, however high the men's pay may appear, it is barely &s;ufficient, in the pre&s;ent &s;carcity and
<PB N="221" REF="031423_0220_0FEC5AEA4CF5DF00">
dearne&s;s of all kinds of goods, to keep them in clothes, much le&s;s afford &s;upport to their families.</P>
<P>If this encouragement then is given to the men, and &s;uch pay allowed the officers as will induce gentlemen of character and liberal &s;entiments to engage, and proper care and precaution u&s;ed in the nomination (having more regard to the characters of per&s;ons than the number of men they can enli&s;t), we &s;hould in a little time have an army able to cope with any that can be oppo&s;ed to it, as there are excellent materials to form one out of. But while the only merit an officer po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es is his ability to rai&s;e men, while tho&s;e men con&s;ider and treat him as an equal, (and in the character of an officer) regard him no more than a broom-&s;tick, being mixed to|gether as one common herd,&mdash;no order nor di&s;cipline can prevail; nor will the officer ever meet with that re&s;pect which is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to due &s;ubordination.</P>
<P>To place any dependence upon a militia is a&s;&s;uredly re&s;ting up|on a broken &s;taff,&mdash;men ju&s;t dragged from the tender &s;cenes of dome&s;tic life,&mdash;unaccu&s;tomed to the din of arms,&mdash;totally un|acquainted with every kind of military &s;kill; which being followed by a want of confidence in them&s;elves, when oppo&s;ed to troops regularly trained, di&s;ciplined, and appointed, &s;uperior in know|ledge and &s;uperior in arms, makes them timid and ready to fly from their own &s;hadows. Be&s;ides, the &s;udden change in their manner of living (particularly in the lodging) brings on &s;ickne&s;s in many, impatience in all, and &s;uch an unconquerable de&s;ire of re|turning to their re&s;pective homes, that it not only produces &s;hame|ful and &s;candalous de&s;ertions among them&s;elves, but infu&s;es the like &s;pirit into others.</P>
<P>Again, men accu&s;tomed to unbounded freedom and no control, cannot brook the re&s;traint which is indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to the good order and government of an army; without which, licentiou&s;|ne&s;s and every kind of di&s;order triumphantly reign.&mdash;To bring men to a proper degree of &s;ubordination is not the work of a day, a month, or even a year: and, unhappily for us and the cau&s;e we are engaged in, the little di&s;cipline I have been laboring to e&s;tabli&s;h in the army under my immediate command is in a manner done away by having &s;uch a mixture of troops as have been called toge|ther within the&s;e few months.</P>
<P>Relaxed and unfit as our rules and regulations of war are for the government of an army, the militia (tho&s;e properly &s;o cal|led; for of the&s;e we have two &s;orts, the &s;ix-months-men and tho&s;e &s;ent in as a temporary aid) do not think them&s;elves &s;ub|ject to them, and therefore take liberties which the &s;oldier is puni&s;hed for. This creates jealou&s;y: jealou&s;y begets di&s;&s;atis|faction;

and the&s;e by degrees ripen into mutiny, keeping the whole army in a confu&s;ed and di&s;ordered &s;tate,&mdash;rendering the time of tho&s;e who wi&s;h to &s;ee regularity and good order prevail, more unhappy than words can de&s;cribe. Be&s;ides this, &s;uch re|peated changes take place, that all arrangement is &s;et at nought, and the con&s;tant fluctuation of things deranges every plan as fa&s;t as adopted.</P>
<P>The&s;e, &s;ir, Congre&s;s may be a&s;&s;ured, are but a &s;mall part of the inconveniencies which might be enumerated, and attributed to militia: but there is one that merits particular attention, and that is the expen&s;e. Certain I am, that it would be cheaper to keep fifty or a hundred thou&s;and in con&s;tant pay, than to de|pend upon half the number and &s;upply the other half occa&s;ion|ally by militia. The time the latter are in pay before and after they are in camp, a&s;&s;embling and marching&mdash;The wa&s;te of am|munition, the con&s;umption of &s;tores, which in &s;pite of every re|&s;olution or requi&s;ition of Congre&s;s, they mu&s;t be furni&s;hed with, or &s;ent home,&mdash;added to other incidental expen&s;es con&s;equent upon their coming and conduct in camp,&mdash;&s;urpa&s;&s;es all idea, and de&s;troys every kind of regularity and economy which you could e&s;tabli&s;h among fixed and &s;ettled troops, and will, in my opinion prove (if the &s;cheme is adhered to) the ruin of our cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The jealou&s;ies of a &s;tanding army, and the evils to be appre|hended from one, are remote, and, in my judgment, &s;ituated and circum&s;tanced as we are, not at all to be dreaded: but the con&s;equence of wanting one, according to my ideas formed from the pre&s;ent view of things, is certain and inevitable ruin. For, if I was called upon to declare upon oath, whether the militia have been mo&s;t &s;erviceable or hurtful upon the whole, I &s;hould &s;ub&s;cribe to the latter. I do not mean by this, however, to arraign the conduct of Congre&s;s: in &s;o doing I &s;hall equally condemn my own mea&s;ures, if I did not my judgment: but ex|perience, which is the be&s;t criterion to work by, &s;o fully, clear|ly and deci&s;ively reprobates the practice of tru&s;ting to militia, that no man who regards order, regularity and economy, or who has any regard for his own honor, character, or peace of mind, will ri&s;k them upon this i&s;&s;ue. * * *</P>
<P>An army formed of good officers moves like clock-work; but there is no &s;ituation upon earth le&s;s enviable nor more di&s;tre&s;&s;|ing than that per&s;on's who is at the head of troops who are regardle&s;s of order and di&s;cipline, and who are unprovided with almo&s;t every nece&s;&s;ary.

kept my mind con&s;tantly upon the &s;tretch,&mdash;the wounds which my feelings (as an officer) have received by a thou&s;and things which have happened contrary to my expectation and wi&s;hes, * * *&mdash;added to a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my inability to govern an army compo&s;ed of &s;uch di&s;cordant parts, and under &s;uch a vari|ety of intricate and perplexing circum&s;tances,&mdash;induce not only a belief, but a thorough conviction in my mind, that it will be impo&s;&s;ible (unle&s;s there is a thorough change in our military &s;y&s;tem) for me to conduct matters in &s;uch a manner as to give &s;atisfaction to the public, which is all the recompence I aim at, or even wi&s;hed for.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING wrote you fully on &s;undry important &s;ubjects this morning, as you will perceive by the letter which accom|panies this, I mean principally now to inclo&s;e a copy of a letter received from general Howe on &s;unday morning, with the li&s;ts of the pri&s;oners in his hands,&mdash;of tho&s;e in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion belong|ing to the army immediately under his command,&mdash;and of my an&s;wer, which were omitted to be put in the other. His letter will di&s;cover to congre&s;s his refu&s;al to exchange lord Sterling for Mr. M'Donald, con&s;idering the latter only as a major. They will plea&s;e to determine how he is to be ranked in fu|ture.</P>
<P>The number of pri&s;oners according to the&s;e returns is great|er than what we expected. However, I am inclined to believe, that, among tho&s;e in the li&s;t from Long-I&s;land, are &s;everal mi|litia of general Woodhull's party, who were never arranged in this army.&mdash;As to tho&s;e taken on the fifteenth, they greatly exceed the number that I &s;uppo&s;ed fell into their hands in the retreat from the city. At the time that I tran&s;mitted an ac|count of that affair, I had not obtained returns, and took the matter upon the officers' reports. They are difficult to get with certainty at any time.&mdash;In the &s;kirmi&s;h of monday &s;e'nnight, they could have taken but very few.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="031423_0223_0FEC5AF7206AFB10">
Before I conclude, I &s;hall take occa&s;ion to mention that tho&s;e returns made with &s;uch preci&s;ion, and the difficulty that will attend the propo&s;ed exchange on account of the di&s;per&s;ed and &s;cattered &s;tate of the pri&s;oners in our hands, will clearly evince the nece&s;&s;ity of appointing commi&s;&s;aries and proper per&s;ons to &s;uperintend and conduct in &s;uch in&s;tances. This I took the liberty of urging more than once, as well on account of the propriety of the mea&s;ure and the &s;aving that would have re&s;ulted from it, as that the pri&s;oners might be treated with humanity, and have their wants particularly attended to.</P>
<P>I would al&s;o ob&s;erve, (as I e&s;teem it my duty) that this ar|my is in want of almo&s;t every nece&s;&s;ary,&mdash;tents, camp kettles, blankets, and clothes of all kinds. But what is to be done with re&s;pect to the two la&s;t articles, I know not, as the term of enli&s;t|ment will be nearly expired by the time they can be provided. This may be exhibited as a further proof of the di&s;advantages attending the levying of an army upon &s;uch a footing as never to know how to keep them without injuring the public or incom|moding the men.&mdash;I have directed the colonel or commanding officer of each corps to u&s;e his endeavors to procure &s;uch clothing as is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary: but at the &s;ame time I confe&s;s, that I do not know how they are to be got.</P>

<P>I DO my&s;elf the honor of tran&s;mitting to you the inclo&s;ed letter from lieutenant-colonel Living&s;ton, with &s;undry copies of general Delancey's orders, which di&s;cover the mea&s;ures the enemy are pur&s;uing on Long-I&s;land for rai&s;ing recruits and obtaining &s;upplies of provi&s;ions. In con&s;equence of the intel|ligence they contain, and authentic advices through other channels re&s;pecting the&s;e matters, I have &s;ent brigadier-general George Clinton to meet general Lincoln who has got as far as Fairfield with part of the troops lately ordered by the Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts a&s;&s;embly, to concert with him and others an expedition acro&s;s the Sound with tho&s;e troops, three companies under colonel Living&s;ton, and &s;uch further aid as governor Trumbull can afford, in order to prevent if po&s;&s;ible their effecting tho&s;e important ob|jects, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t the inhabiants in the removal of their &s;tock, grain, &amp;c. or in de&s;troying them, that the enemy may not derive any advantage or benefit from them.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="031423_0226_0FEC5B03B42BF118">
The recruiting &s;cheme they are pro&s;ecuting with uncommon in|du&s;try; nor is it confined to Long-I&s;land alone. Having ju&s;t now received a letter from the committee of We&s;t-Che&s;ter county, advi&s;ing that there are &s;everal companies of men in that and Dutche&s;s county preparing to go off and join the king's ar|my, I have given directions to our guard-boats and the centries at our works at Mount-Wa&s;hington to keep a &s;trict look-out in ca&s;e they attempt to come down the North-river; al&s;o to general Heath at King&s;bridge, that the utmo&s;t vigilance may be ob&s;erved by the regiments and troops &s;tationed above there and down tow|ards the Ea&s;t-river, that they may intercept them, &s;hould they take that rout with a view of cro&s;&s;ing to Long-I&s;land.&mdash;I will u&s;e every precaution in my power, to prevent tho&s;e parricides from ac|compli&s;hing their de&s;igns; but I have but little hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, as it will be no difficult matter for them to procure a pa&s;&s;age over &s;ome part or other of the Sound.</P>
<P>I have been applied to lately by colonel Weedon of Virginia, for permi&s;&s;ion to recruit the deficiency of men in his regiment out of the troops compo&s;ing the flying camp,&mdash;informing me at the &s;ame time that &s;ome of tho&s;e from Maryland had offered to engage. Colonel Hand of the rifle battalion made a &s;imilar applica|tion to-day. If the enli&s;tments could be made, they would have this good con&s;equence,&mdash;the &s;ecuring of &s;o many in the &s;ervice. However, as the mea&s;ure might occa&s;ion &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s in their own corps, and be con&s;idered as a hard&s;hip by the &s;tates to which they belong, and the means of their furni&s;hing more than the quota exacted from them in the general arrangement, and would make it more difficult for them to complete their own levies, I did not conceive my&s;elf at liberty to author|i&s;e it without &s;ubmitting the propriety of it to the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s, and obtaining their opinion whether it &s;hould be allow|ed or not.</P>
<P>I have inclo&s;ed a li&s;t of warrants granted from the &s;econd to the thirteenth ultimo inclu&s;ive, the only return of that &s;ort that I have been able to make &s;ince the re&s;olution for that purpo&s;e,&mdash;owing to the un&s;ettled &s;tate of our affairs, and my having &s;ent my papers a|way. You will al&s;o receive &s;undry letters, &amp;c. from general Schuyler, which came under cover to me, and which I have the honor of forwarding.</P>
<P>By a letter ju&s;t received from the committee of &s;afety of the &s;tate of New-Hamp&s;hire, I find a thou&s;and of their militia were about to march on the twenty-fourth ultimo to reinforce this army in con&s;equence of the requi&s;ition of Congre&s;s. Previ|ous to their march, general Ward writes me he was obliged

to furni&s;h them with five hundred pounds of powder, and a thou|&s;and pounds of mu&s;ket-ball; and I have little rea&s;on to expect that they are better provided with other articles than they were with ammunition. In &s;uch ca&s;e they will only add to our pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s, which is already far too great, and become di&s;gu&s;ted with the &s;ervice, though the time they are engaged for is only till the fir&s;t of December.&mdash;This will injure their enli&s;ting for a long|er term if not wholly prevent it.</P>
<P>By three de&s;erters who came from the Galatea man-of-war a|bout five days ago, we are informed that &s;everal tran&s;ports had &s;ailed, before they left her, from England, as it was generally reported, in order to return with a &s;upply of provi&s;ions, of which they &s;ay there is a want.&mdash;General Mercer, in a let|ter, informed me that general Thomp&s;on &s;aid he had heard they were going to di&s;mi&s;s about a hundred of the &s;hips from the &s;er|vice.&mdash;I am al&s;o advi&s;ed by a letter from Mr. Derby at Bo&s;ton, of the twenty-&s;ixth ultimo, that, the day before, a tran&s;|port &s;now had been taken and &s;ent into Pi&s;cataway by a privateer, in her pa&s;&s;age from New-York to the We&s;t-Indies. She &s;ail|ed with five more under the convoy of a man-of-war in or|der to bring from thence the troops that are there, to join general Howe.&mdash;They were all victualled for four months.&mdash;From this intelligence it would &s;eem as if they did not appre|hend any thing to be meditated again&s;t them by the court of France.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BEFORE I knew of the late re&s;olutions of Congre&s;s which you did me the honor to enclo&s;e in your letter of the twen|ty-fourth, and before I was favored with the vi&s;it of your committee, I took the liberty of giving you my &s;entiments on &s;everal points which &s;eemed to be of importance.&mdash;I have no doubt but that the committee will make &s;uch report of the &s;tate and condition of the army, as will induce Congre&s;s to believe
<PB N="229" REF="031423_0228_0FEC5B08E73260C8">
that nothing but the mo&s;t vigorous exertions can put matters upon &s;uch a footing as to give this continent a fair pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. Give me leave to &s;ay, &s;ir&mdash;I &s;ay it with due defer|ence and re&s;pect (and my knowledge of the facts, added to the importance of the cau&s;e, and the &s;take I hold in it, mu&s;t ju&s;tify the freedom,&mdash;that your affairs are in a more unpromi&s;ing way than you &s;eem to apprehend.</P>
<P>Your army, as I mentioned in my la&s;t, is on the eve of its political di&s;&s;olution. True it is, you have voted a larger one in lieu of it; but the &s;ea&s;on is late; and there is a material dif|ference between voting of battalions and rai&s;ing of men. In the latter there are more difficulties than Congre&s;s are aware of; which makes it my duty (as I have been informed of the prevailing &s;entiments of this army) to inform them, that, unle&s;s the pay of the officers, e&s;pecially that of the field officers is rai&s;ed, the chief part of tho&s;e that are worth retaining will leave the &s;ervice at the expiration of the pre&s;ent term, as the &s;oldiers will al&s;o, if &s;ome greater encourrgement is not offered them than twenty dollars and a hundred acres of land.</P>
<P>Nothing le&s;s, in my opinion, than a &s;uit of clothes annually given to each non-commi&s;&s;ioned officer and &s;oldier, in addition to the pay and bounty, will avail; and I que&s;tion whether that will do, as the enemy (from the information of one John Ma&s;h, who, with &s;ix others, was taken by our guards) are giving ten pounds bounty for recruits, and have got a battalion under major Rogers nearly completed upon Long-I&s;land.</P>
<P>Nor will le&s;s pay, according to my judgment, than I have taken the liberty of mentioning in the inclo&s;ed e&s;timate, retain &s;uch officers as we could wi&s;h to have continued. The differ|ence per month in each battalion will amount to better than a hundred pounds. To this may be added the pay of the &s;taff|officers; for it is pre&s;umable they will not require an augment|ation: but, being few in number, the &s;um will not be greatly increa&s;ed by them, and con&s;equently is a matter of no great moment: but it is a matter of no &s;mall importance to make the &s;everal officers de&s;irable. When the pay and e&s;tabli&s;hment of an officer once becomes objects of intere&s;ted attention, the &s;loth, negligence, and even di&s;obedience of orders, which at this time but too generally prevail, will be purged off. But while the &s;ervice is viewed with indifference,&mdash;while the officer conceives that he is rather conferring than receiving an obligation,&mdash;there will be a total relaxation of all order and di&s;cipline, and every thing will move heavily on, to the great detriment
<PB N="230" REF="031423_0229_0FEC5B0B152C9BC8">
of the &s;ervice, and inexpre&s;&s;ible trouble and vexation of the general.</P>
<P>The critical &s;ituation of our affairs at this time will ju&s;tify my &s;aying that no time is to be lo&s;t in making of fruitle&s;s ex|periments. An unavailing trial of a month to get an army upon the terms propo&s;ed may render it impracticable to do it at all, and prove fatal to our cau&s;e; as I am not &s;ure whether any rubs in the way of our enli&s;tments, or unfavorable turn in our affairs, may not prove the means of the enemy recruiting men fa&s;ter than we do. To this may be added the inextricable difficulty of forming one corps out of another, and arranging matters with any degree of order, in the face of an enemy who are watching for advantages.</P>
<P>At Cambridge, la&s;t year, where the officers, (and more than a &s;ufficiency of them) were all upon the &s;pot, we found it a work of &s;uch extreme difficulty to know their &s;entiments (each having &s;ome terms to propo&s;e) that I de&s;paired once of getting the arrangements completed: and I do &s;uppo&s;e, that at lea&s;t a hundred alterations took place before matters were finally ad|ju&s;ted. What mu&s;t it be then under the pre&s;ent regulation, where the officer is to negotiate this matter with the &s;tate he comes from, di&s;tant perhaps, two or three hundred miles?&mdash;&s;ome of whom, without leave or licence from me, &s;et out to make per&s;onal application, the moment the re&s;olve got to their hands. What kind of officers the&s;e are I leave Congre&s;s to judge.</P>
<P>If an officer of reputation (for none other &s;hould be applied to) is a&s;ked to &s;tay, what an&s;wer can he give, but in the fir&s;t place, that he does not know whether it is at his option to do &s;o, no provi&s;ion being made in the re&s;olution of Congre&s;s, even recommendatory of this mea&s;ure; con&s;equently, that it re&s;ts with the &s;tate he comes from (&s;urrounded perhaps with a vari|ety of applications, and influenced probably by local attach|ments) to determine whether he can be provided for or not? In the next place, if he is an officer of merit, and knows that the &s;tate he comes from is to furni&s;h more battalions than it at pre&s;ent has in the &s;ervice, he will &s;carcely, after two years' faithful &s;ervices, think of continuing in the rank he now bears, when new creations are to be made, and men appointed to offi|ces (no wi&s;e &s;uperior in merit, and ignorant perhaps, of &s;ervice) over his head. A committee, &s;ent to the army from each &s;tate, may upon the &s;pot fix things with a degree of propriety and certainty, and is the only method I can &s;ee of bringing matters to a deci&s;ion with re&s;pect to the officers of the army.
<PB N="231" REF="031423_0230_0FEC5B10D6D74E28">
But what can be done in the mean while towards the arrang|ment in the country, I know not. In the one ca&s;e you run the hazard of loo&s;ing your officers; in the other, of encountering delay, unle&s;s &s;ome method could be devi&s;ed of forwarding both at the &s;ame in&s;tant.</P>
<P>Upon the pre&s;ent plan, I plainly fore&s;ee an intervention of time between the old and new army, which mu&s;t be filled up with militia (if to be had), with whom no man who has any regard for his own reputation can undertake to be an&s;werable for con&s;equences. I &s;hall al&s;o be mi&s;taken in my conjectures, if we do not lo&s;e the mo&s;t valuable officers in this army, under the pre&s;ent mode of appointing them: con&s;equently, if we have an army at all, it will be compo&s;ed of materials not only en|tirely raw, but, (if uncommon pains are not taken) entirely unfit; and I &s;ee &s;uch a di&s;tru&s;t and jealou&s;y of military power, that the commander-in-chief has not an opportunity, even by recommendation, to give the lea&s;t a&s;&s;urances of reward for the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential &s;ervices. In a word, &s;uch a cloud of perplexing circum&s;tances appear before me, without one flattering hope, that I am thoroughly convinced, unle&s;s the mo&s;t vigorous and deci&s;ive exertions are immediately adopted to remedy the&s;e e|vils, that the certain and ab&s;olute lo&s;s of our liberties will be the inevitable con&s;equence; as one unhappy &s;troke will throw a powerful weight into the &s;cale again&s;t us, enabling general Howe to recruit his army as fa&s;t as we &s;hall ours,&mdash;numbers be|ing di&s;po&s;ed [<HI>to join him</HI>], and many actually doing &s;o already. Some of the mo&s;t probable remedies, and &s;uch as experience has brought to my more intimate knowlede, I have taken the liberty to point out: the re&s;t I beg leave to &s;ubmit to the con&s;ider|ation of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>I a&s;k pardon for taking up &s;o much of their time with my opinions. But I &s;hould betray that tru&s;t which they and my coun|try have repo&s;ed in me, were I to be &s;ilent upon a matter &s;o extremely intere&s;ting.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS la&s;t night honored with your favor of the &s;econd, with &s;undry re&s;olutions of Congre&s;s. * * *</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to the exchange of pri&s;oners, I fear it will be a work of great difficulty, owing to their di&s;per&s;ed and &s;cattered
<PB N="232" REF="031423_0231_0FEC5B1760491B30">
&s;ituation throughout the &s;tates. In order to effect it, I have wrote to the ea&s;tern governments to have them collected, and to tran&s;mit me an account of their number, di&s;tingui&s;hing the names and ranks of the field and commi&s;&s;ioned officers, and the corps they belong to. I have al&s;o wrote to governor Living&s;ton of the Jer&s;eys upon the &s;ubject, and mu&s;t take the liberty of reque&s;ting congre&s;s to give directions that a &s;imilar return may be made of tho&s;e in Penn&s;ylva|nia and Maryland, and for their being brought to Brun&s;wick, that they may be ready to be exchanged for an equal number of tho&s;e of the &s;ame rank.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve, by the re&s;olve of the twenty-&s;ixth ultimo, that the exchange is particularly directed to be made of the officers and &s;oldiers taken on Long-I&s;land. But &s;hould not that follow the ex|change of tho&s;e officers and men who have lately returned from Quebec, who&s;e impri&s;onment has been much longer, and who&s;e &s;ervice has not been le&s;s &s;evere, and, in many in&s;tances, conducted with great intrepidity? I have had many applications &s;ince their arrival, by which they claim a kind of preference as far as their number and the circum&s;tance of their rank will allow, and which I thought it my duty to mention, that I may obtain &s;ome direction upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>You will ob&s;erve by a paragraph of a letter received ye&s;terday from general Howe, a copy of which you have at length, that the non-performance of the agreement between captain For&s;ter and general Arnold, by which the latter &s;tipulated for the return of an equal number of officers and pri&s;oners in our hands for tho&s;e de|livered him, is con&s;idered in an unfavorable light, and entirely imputed to me, as having the chief command of the armies of the &s;tates, and a controling power over general Arnold.&mdash;The pointed manner in which Mr. Howe is plea&s;ed to expre&s;s him&s;elf could not per&s;onally effect me, &s;uppo&s;ing there had been no good grounds for the treaty not being ratified, having been nothing more than an in&s;trument conveying to him the re&s;olutions formed upon the &s;ubject. * * *</P>
<P>However I would beg leave to ob&s;erve, from the letters from the ho&s;tages,&mdash;from what has been reported by others re|&s;pecting captain For&s;ter's having u&s;ed his endeavors to re&s;train the &s;avages from exerci&s;ing their wonted barbarities, though in &s;ome in&s;tances they did,&mdash;his purcha&s;ing &s;ome of the pri&s;oners for a pretty con&s;iderable premium,&mdash;but, above all, from the delicate nature of &s;uch treaties, and becau&s;e the non-ob&s;ervance of them mu&s;t damp the &s;pirits of the officers who make them, and add affliction to the misfortunes of tho&s;e whom nece&s;&s;ity and the nature of the ca&s;e force into captivity to give them a

&s;anction by a long and irk&s;ome confinement,&mdash;for the&s;e rea&s;ons and many more that will readily occur, I could wi&s;h Congre&s;s to recon&s;ider the matter, and to carry it into execution.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible the wrong was originally in their employing &s;a|vages, and that whatever cruelties were committed by them &s;hould be e&s;teemed their own acts: yet perhaps, in point of po|licy, it may not be improper to overlook the&s;e infractions on their part, and to pur&s;ue that mode which will be the mo&s;t likely to render the hard&s;hips incident to war mo&s;t tolerable, and the grea|te&s;t benefits to the &s;tate.</P>
<P>I have ventured to &s;ay thus much on the &s;ubject, from a regard to the &s;ervice, and becau&s;e &s;uch gentlemen of the army as I have heard mention it, &s;eem to wi&s;h the treaty had been ratified rather than di&s;allowed.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed is a li&s;t of vacancies in the third regiment of Virgi|nia troops, in part occa&s;ioned by the death of major Leitch who died of his wounds on tue&s;day morning,&mdash;and of the gen|tlemen who &s;tand next in regimental order, and who are recom|mended to &s;ucceed to them.&mdash;You will ob&s;erve that captain John Fitzgerald is &s;aid to be appointed to the duty of major. This I have done in order, being the olde&s;t captain in the re|giment, and, I believe, an officer of unexceptionable merit, and as it was highly nece&s;&s;ary at this time to have the corps as well and fully officered as po&s;&s;ible. There is al&s;o a vacancy in the fir&s;t continental battalion, by the promotion of lieutenant Clarke to a majority in the flying camp, to which colonel Hand has recommended William Patton to &s;ucceed, as you will perceive by his letter inclo&s;ed.</P>
<P>I have taken the liberty to tran&s;mit a plan for e&s;tabli&s;hing a corps of engineers, artificers, &amp;c. &s;ketched out by colonel Putnam, and which is propo&s;ed for the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s. How far they may incline to adopt it, or whether they may ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> to pro|ceed upon &s;uch an exten&s;ive &s;cale, they will be plea&s;ed to deter|mine. However, I conceive it a matter well worthy of their con&s;ideration, being convinced from experience, and from the rea&s;ons &s;ugge&s;ted by colonel Putnam who has acted with great diligence and reputation in the bu&s;ine&s;s, that &s;ome e&s;tabli&s;hment of the &s;ort is highly nece&s;&s;ary, and will be productive of the mo&s;t beneficial con&s;equences.</P>
<P>If the propo&s;ition is approved by Congre&s;s, I am informed by good authority that there is a gentleman in Virginia, in the colony &s;ervice, John Stadler, e&s;quire, a native of Germany, who&s;e abilities in this way are by no means incon&s;iderable. I am told he was an engineer in the army under general Stanwix,
<PB N="234" REF="031423_0233_0FEC5B1D30005C50">
and is reputed to be of &s;kill and ingenuity in the profe&s;&s;ion. In this capacity I do not know him my&s;elf, but am intimately ac|quainted with him in his private character, as a man of under|&s;tanding and of good behaviour. I would &s;ubmit his merit to the inquiry of Congre&s;s; and if he &s;hould an&s;wer the report I have had of him, I make no doubt but he will be &s;uitably provided for.</P>
<P>The convention of this &s;tate have lately &s;eized and had ap|prai&s;ed two new &s;hips, valued at &s;ix thou&s;and two hundred and twenty-nine pounds York currency, which they have &s;ent down for the purpo&s;e of &s;inking, and ob&s;tructing the channel oppo&s;ite Mount-Wa&s;hington. The price being high, and the opinions various as to the nece&s;&s;ity of the mea&s;ure, &s;ome conceiving the ob&s;truction nearly &s;ufficient already, and others that they would render it &s;ecure, I would wi&s;h to have the direction of Con|gre&s;s upon the &s;ubject by the earlie&s;t opportunity, thinking my|&s;elf, that, if the enemy &s;hould attempt to come up, they &s;hould be u&s;ed, &s;ooner than to hazard their pa&s;&s;ing.&mdash;I mu&s;t be governed by circum&s;tances, yet hope for their &s;entiments before any thing is nece&s;&s;ary to be done.</P>
<P>Sundry di&s;putes having ari&s;en of late between officers of dif|ferent regiments and of the &s;ame rank, re&s;pecting the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to &s;uch vacancies as happen from death or other cau&s;es,&mdash;&s;ome &s;ugge&s;tion that it &s;hould be in a colonial line and governed by the priority of their commi&s;&s;ions,&mdash;others, that it &s;hould be regimentally,&mdash;and there being an in&s;tance now be|fore me, between the officers of the Virginia regiments, occa|&s;ioned by the death of major Leitch,&mdash;it has become ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that Congre&s;s &s;hould determine the mode by which promotions are to be regulated,&mdash;whether colonially and by priority of commi&s;&s;ions, or regimentally, re&s;erving a right out of the general rule they adopt, to reward for particular merit, or of withholding from office &s;uch as may not be worthy to &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>I have only propo&s;ed two modes for their con&s;ideration, be|ing &s;atisfied that promotions through the line (as they are call|ed) can never take place without producing di&s;cord, jealou&s;y, di&s;tru&s;t, and the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences. In &s;ome of my let|ters upon the &s;ubject of promotions, and one which I had the honor of addre&s;&s;ing to the board of war on the thirtieth ultimo, I advi&s;ed that the mode &s;hould be rather practi&s;ed than re&s;olv|ed: but I am fully convinced now of the nece&s;&s;ity there is of &s;ettling it in one of the two ways I have taken the liberty to point out, and under the re&s;trictions I have mentioned; or the

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DO my&s;elf the honor of tran&s;mitting to you a copy of a letter from the comte D'Emery, governor-general of the French part of St. Domingo, which I received ye&s;terday, and al&s;o my an&s;wer, which I have enclo&s;ed and left open for the con&s;i|deration of Congre&s;s, wi&s;hing that it may be &s;ealed if they ap|prove of the &s;ieur De Chambeau's relea&s;ement, which I think may be attended with many valuable con&s;equences. If Con|gre&s;s concur in &s;entiment with me, they will be plea&s;ed to give direction for his pa&s;&s;age by the fir&s;t opportunity to the French i&s;lands: if they do not, I &s;hall be obliged by your returning my letter.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o the plea&s;ure of inclo&s;ing a copy of a letter from mon&s;ieur P. Pennel, which came to hand la&s;t night, and which contains intelligence of an agreeable and intere&s;ting nature, for which I beg leave to refer you to the copy. The polite manner in which mon&s;ieur Pennel has reque&s;ted to be one of my aids-de-camp demands my acknowledgments. As the appointment will not be attended with any expen&s;e, and will &s;hew a proper regard for his complai&s;ance and the attachment he is plea&s;ed to expre&s;s for the &s;ervice of the American &s;tates, I &s;hall take the liberty of complying with his requi&s;ition, and tran&s;mit him a brevet com|mi&s;&s;ion, provided the fame &s;hall be agreeable to Congre&s;s.&mdash;Their &s;entiments upon this &s;ubject you will be kind enough to favor me with by the fir&s;t opportunity. The inclo&s;ed letter for the &s;ieur De Chambeau you will plea&s;e to forward to him (if he is to be enlarged) after clo&s;ing it.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I mu&s;t take the liberty to ob&s;erve that I am under no &s;mall difficulties on account of the French gentle|men that are here in con&s;equence of the commi&s;&s;ions they have received,&mdash;having no means to employ them, or to afford them an opportunity of rendering that &s;ervice they them&s;elves wi&s;h to give, or which perhaps is expected by the public. Their want of our language is an objection to their being joined to a|ny of the regiments here at this time, were there vacancies, and not other ob&s;tacles. The&s;e con&s;iderations induce me to
<PB N="236" REF="031423_0235_0FEC5B2272746D78">
wi&s;h that Congre&s;s would adopt and point out &s;ome particular mode to be ob&s;erved re&s;pecting them. What it &s;hould be, they will be be&s;t able to determine. But to me it appears that their being here now can be attended with no valuable con&s;equences, and that, as the power of appointing officers for the new army is ve&s;ted in the conventions, &amp;c. of the &s;everal &s;tates, it will be nece&s;&s;ary for Congre&s;s to direct them to be provided for in the regiments to be rai&s;ed, according to the ranks they would wi&s;h them to bear&mdash;(or I am convinced they will never be ta|ken in, let their merit be what it may); or to form them into a di&s;tinct corps which may be increa&s;ed in time. They &s;eem to be genteel, &s;en&s;ible men; and I have no doubt of their mak|ing good officers as &s;oon as they can learn as much of our lan|guage as to make them&s;elves well under&s;tood: but, unle&s;s Con|gre&s;s interfere by their particular direction to the &s;tates, they will never be incorporated in any of the regiments to be rai&s;ed; and, without they are, they will be entirely at a lo&s;s, and in the mo&s;t irk&s;ome &s;ituation, for &s;omething to do, as they now are.&mdash;I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I had the honor of writing you ye&s;terday, I have been favored with a letter from the honorable council of Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, covering one from Richard Derby, e&s;quire, a copy of which is herewith tran&s;mitted, as it contains intelligence of an important and intere&s;ting nature.</P>
<P>As an exchange of pri&s;oners is about to take place, I am in|duced, from a que&s;tion &s;tated in a letter I received from go|vernor Trumbull this morning, to a&s;k the opinion of Congre&s;s in what manner the &s;tates that have had the care of them are to be reimbur&s;ed the expen&s;es incurred on their account. My want of information in this in&s;tance, or whether any account is to be &s;ent in with the pri&s;oners, would not allow me to give him an an&s;wer, as nothing that I recollect has ever been &s;aid upon the &s;ubject.&mdash;He al&s;o mentions another matter, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> whe|ther &s;uch privates as are mechanics, and others who may de&s;ire to remain with us, &s;hould be obliged to return.&mdash;In re&s;pect to the latter, I conceive there can be no doubt of our being un|der a nece&s;&s;ity of returning the whole, a propo&s;ition having been made on our part for a general exchange, and that agreed to; be&s;ides, the balance of pri&s;oners is greatly again&s;t us; and
<PB N="237" REF="031423_0236_0FEC5B247A65C888">
I am informed it was particularly &s;tipulated by general Montgo|mery, that all tho&s;e that were taken in Canada &s;hould be exchang|ed whenever a cartel was &s;ettled for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e the &s;everal commit|tees having the care of them &s;hould be in&s;tructed to make the mo&s;t exact returns of the whole, however willing a part &s;hould be to continue with us. At the &s;ame time I &s;hould think it not impro|per to inform them of the rea&s;ons leading to the mea&s;ure, and that they &s;hould be invited to e&s;cape afterwards, which, in all proba|bility, they may effect without much difficulty if they are attach|ed to us, extending their influence to many more, and bringing them away al&s;o.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of our affairs and the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment of the army requiring our mo&s;t vigorous exertions to engage a new one, I pre&s;ume it will be nece&s;&s;ary to furni&s;h the payma&s;|ter-general as early as po&s;&s;ible with money to pay the bounty, late|ly re&s;olved on, to &s;uch men as will enli&s;t. Prompt pay, per|haps may have a happy effect, and induce the continuance of &s;ome who are here: but, without it, I am certain that no|thing can be done; nor have we time to lo&s;e in making the expe|riment. But then it may be a&s;ked, who is to recruit? or who can con&s;ider them&s;elves as officers for that purpo&s;e, till the conventions of the different &s;tates have made the appoint|ments?</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday afternoon the exchange between lord Sterling and governor Browne was carried into execution; and his lord&s;hip is now here. He confirms the intelligence mentioned by captain Souther, about the tran&s;ports he met, by the arrival of the Daphne man-of-war (a twenty gun &s;hip) a few days ago, with twelve &s;hips under her convoy, having light-hor&s;e on board. They &s;ailed with about twenty in each, and lo&s;t about eighteen in their pa&s;&s;age, be&s;ides tho&s;e in the ve&s;&s;el taken by cap|tain Souther.&mdash;He further adds that he had heard it acknowledged more than once, that, in the action of the &s;ixteenth ultimo, the enemy had a hundred men killed,&mdash;about &s;ixty Highlanders of the forty-&s;econd regiment, and forty of the light infantry. This confe&s;&s;ion coming from them&s;elves, we may rea&s;onably con|clude, did not exaggerate the number, * * *</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 9.&mdash;About eight o'clock this morning, two &s;hips, of forty-four guns each (&s;uppo&s;ed to be the Roebuck and Phoenix), and a frigate of twenty guns, with three or four tenders, got under way from about Bloomingdale where they had been lying &s;ome time, and &s;tood with an ea&s;y &s;outherly breeze to|wards

our chevaux-de-fri&s;e, which we hoped would have intercept|ed their pa&s;&s;age while our batteries played upon them: but, to our &s;urpri&s;e and mortification, they ran through without the lea&s;t difficulty, and without receiving any apparent damage from our forts, though they kept up a heavy fire from both &s;ides of the river. Their de&s;tination or views cannot be known with certainty: but mo&s;t probably they are &s;ent to &s;top the navigation, and cut off the &s;upplies of boards, &amp;c. which we &s;hould have re|ceived, and of which we are in great need. They are &s;tanding up, and I have di&s;patched an expre&s;s to the convention of this &s;tate, that notice may be immediately communicated to gene|ral Clinton at the Highland fortifications, to put him on his guard in ca&s;e they &s;hould have any de&s;igns again&s;t them, and that precautions &s;hould be taken to prevent the craft belonging to the river falling into their hands.</P>

<P>I BEG leave to inform you, that, &s;ince my letter of the eighth and ninth in&s;tant which I had the honor of addre&s;&s;ing you, nothing of importance has occurred, except of that the &s;hips of war which I then mentioned, in their pa&s;&s;age up the river, took a &s;loop that was at anchor off the mouth of Spitendevil, and two of our row-gallies which they out-&s;ailed. The crews, finding that they could not prevent them falling into the enemy's hands, ran them near the &s;hore and effected their own e&s;cape. From the intelligence I have received, the &s;hips are now ly|ing at Tarrytown, without having landed any men (which &s;eemed to be apprehended by &s;ome), or attempted any thing el&s;e. Their principal views in all probability are, to interrupt our navigation, and to receive &s;uch di&s;affected per&s;ons as incline to take part again&s;t us. The former they will effect beyond all que&s;tion; and I fear that their expectations re&s;pecting the latter will be but too fully an&s;wered.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 12.&mdash;The inclo&s;ed copy of a letter received la&s;t night from the convention of this &s;tate will &s;hew you the appre|hen&s;ions they are under on account of the di&s;affected among them.&mdash;I have ordered up a part of the militia from the Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts under general <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, to prevent, if po&s;&s;ible, the con|&s;equences which they &s;ugge&s;t may happen, and which there is rea&s;on to believe the con&s;pirators have in contemplation.

that they will leave nothing un-e&s;&s;ayed that will di&s;tre&s;s us and favor the de&s;igns of the enemy, as &s;oon as their &s;chemes are ripe for it.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 13.&mdash;Ye&s;terday the enemy landed at Frog's-Point, about nine miles from hence, further up the &s;ound. Their number we cannot a&s;certain, as they have not advanced from the point,&mdash;which is a kind of i&s;land,&mdash;but the water that &s;ur|rounds it is favorable at low tide. I have ordered works to be thrown up at the pa&s;&s;es from the point to the main. From the great number of &s;loops, &s;chooners, and nine &s;hips, that went up the Sound in the evening, full of men, and from the informa|tion of two de&s;erters who came over la&s;t night, I have rea&s;on to believe that the greate&s;t part of their army has moved upwards, or is about to do it, pur&s;uing their original plan of get|ting in our rear and cutting off our communication with the coun|try.</P>
<P>The grounds from Frog's-Point are &s;trong and defen&s;ible, be|ing full of &s;tone fences both along the road and acro&s;s the adjacent fields, which will render it difficult for artillery, or indeed a large body of foot, to advance in any regular order, except through the main road.&mdash;Our men who are po&s;ted on the pa&s;&s;es &s;eemed to be in great &s;pirits when I left them la&s;t night.</P>

<P>THE whole of our army is now here and on the neighbor|ing heights, except the troops left at Mount-Wa&s;hington and King&s;bridge (about fourteen hundred at the former, and &s;ix hundred at the latter), and general Lee's divi&s;ion which now forms the rear, and which is on their march. Our removal, and that of the &s;tores, have been attended with a great deal of trouble, owing to the &s;carcity and difficulty of procuring waggons. However, they are nearly effected, and without any lo&s;s.&mdash;The general officers are now reconnoitering the &s;everal pa&s;&s;es lead|ing from the enemy, that the mo&s;t important may be immediately &s;ecured.&mdash;The &s;ituation of their army remains nearly the &s;ame as when I had the honor of addre&s;&s;ing you on the twenty-fir&s;t in&s;tant. It differs in nothing unle&s;s it is that their main body is more col|lected about New-Rochelle. A few of their troops are extended as far as Momarioneck.</P>
<P>On monday night a detachment of our men, under the command of colonel Hazlet, was &s;ent out to &s;urpri&s;e and cut off ma|jor Rogers, if po&s;&s;ible, with his regiment which was po&s;ted there. By &s;ome accident or other the expedition did not &s;ucceed &s;o well as I could have wi&s;hed. However, our advanced party, led on by major Greene of the fir&s;t Virginia regiment, fell in with their out-guard, and brought off thirty-&s;ix pri&s;oners, &s;ixty mu&s;kets, and &s;ome blankets. The number killed is not certainly known: but it is reported by an officer who was there, that he counted about twenty-five.&mdash;Our lo&s;s, two kill|ed,
<PB N="244" REF="031423_0243_0FEF8BC7C8DE4768">
and ten or twelve wounded; among the latter, major Greene, who&s;e recovery is very doubtful.</P>
<P>On wedne&s;day there was al&s;o a &s;mart &s;kirmi&s;h between a party of colonel Hands' riflemen,&mdash;about two hundred and forty,&mdash;and nearly the &s;ame number of He&s;&s;ian cha&s;&s;eurs, in which the latter were put to the rout. Our men buried ten of them on the field, and took two pri&s;oners, one badly wounded. We &s;u&s;tained no other lo&s;s than having one lad wounded, &s;uppo&s;ed mor|tally.</P>
<P>The &s;hips of war that are in the North-river, fell down ye&s;ter|day morning or the evening before, to Dobbs's ferry, to pre|vent our bringing &s;tores from below by water, and the re|moval of tho&s;e that are landed there. As &s;oon as the waggons, employed in bringing the baggage and &s;tores of general Lee's di|vi&s;ion, are di&s;engaged, they will be immediately &s;ent to a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e already there to remove them.</P>
<P>On &s;aturday night we had the misfortune to lo&s;e one of the new &s;hips intended to be &s;unk for ob&s;tructing the channel. She parted her cables in a &s;evere &s;quall, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hen properly balla&s;ted, and bilged as &s;oon as &s;he &s;truck the &s;hore. The other &s;hip was &s;unk well; and ye&s;terday morning two brigs, both ready, were &s;ent down for the &s;ame purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>About two o'clock this afternoon, intelligence was brought to head-quarters that three or four detachments of the enemy were on their march, and had advanced within about four miles of this place. It has been fully confirmed &s;ince by a variety of per&s;ons who have been out to reconnoitre.&mdash;Their number cannot be a&s;cer|tained: but it is generally conjectured that the detachments are or will be &s;ucceeded by as many columns compo&s;ing their main body. Our drums have beat to arms, and the men are ordered to their &s;everal po&s;ts.&mdash;Mo&s;t probably &s;ome important event is upon the eve of taking place; I hope it will be victory in favor of our arms.&mdash;General Lee, with his divi&s;ion, has not got up; but I hear he is on his march.</P>
<P>Experiment having proved it difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to pre|vent the enemy from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the navigation of the North|river, and to rendering the communication and intercour&s;e be|tween the &s;tates divided by it extremely hazardous and preca|rious by means of their &s;hips of war, it has become a matter of important con&s;ideration how to remedy the evil, and to guard again&s;t the con&s;equences which may re&s;ult from it. I am charged by his excellency to mention it to Congre&s;s is a mat|ter that has employed much of his thought, and that &s;eems worthy of the mo&s;t &s;erious attention. He has communicated

it to &s;everal of the general and other officers, and to many gen|tlemen of &s;en&s;e and di&s;cernment, who all agree with him, not only upon the propriety, but the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity that two di&s;tinct armies &s;hould be formed,&mdash;one to act particularly in the &s;tates which lie on the ea&s;t, the other in tho&s;e that are on the &s;outh of the river;&mdash;the whole however to be rai&s;ed on a general plan, and not to be confined to any particular place by the terms of enli&s;t|ment. The&s;e matters,&mdash;the apparent difficulty and perhaps im|practicability of &s;uccours being thrown acro&s;s the river while the enemy can command it,&mdash;have induced his excellency to &s;ubmit the mea&s;ures to their con&s;ideration, not knowing how their opera|tions may be directed, and fore&s;eeing that innumerable evils may ari&s;e if a re&s;pectable force is not appointed to oppo&s;e their arms, wherever they are carried.</P>

<P>THE &s;ituation of of our affairs not permitting his excellency to write him&s;elf, I have it in charge to inform you, that, on ye&s;terday morning about ten o'clock, the enemy appeared in &s;everal large columns in our front, and, from their fir&s;t movements, &s;eemed as if they meant an attack there. However, halting for a little time, their main body filed off to the left, and pre&s;ently began a mo&s;t &s;evere and ince&s;&s;ant cannonade, at a part of our troops who had taken po&s;t on a hill, with a view of throwing up &s;ome lines. At the &s;ame time they advanced in two divi&s;ions, and, after a &s;mart engagement for about a quarter of an hour, obliged our men to give way.</P>
<P>Our lo&s;s is not certainly known; but, from conjecture, is be|tween four and five hundred in killed, wounded, and mi&s;&s;ing.&mdash;What theirs was, we have not heard.</P>
<P>After gaining the hill (upon which they are intrenching) and leaving a &s;ufficient number of men and artillery to prevent our repo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it, they proceeded to advance by our left: and, as far as I can di&s;cover, their po&s;ts or encampments now form nearly a &s;emi-circle. It is evident their de&s;ign is to get in our rear according to their original plan.&mdash;Every mea&s;ure is taking to prevent them: but the removal of our baggage, &amp;c. is attended with infinite difficulty and delays.</P>
<P>Our po&s;t, from its &s;ituation, is not &s;o advantageous as could be wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hed, and was only intended as temporary and occa&s;ional,
<PB N="246" REF="031423_0245_0FEF8BB00E01EC18">
till the &s;tores belonging to the army, which had been depo&s;ited here, could be removed. The enemy coming on &s;o &s;uddenly has di&s;tre&s;&s;ed us much.

<P>SINCE I had the honor of addre&s;&s;ing you on the twenty|ninth in&s;tant, no event of importance has occurred. The ene|my are throwing up &s;ome lines and redoubts in our front, with a view of cannonading as &s;oon as they are ready; and at the &s;ame time are extending their wings farther by our right and left. It is &s;uppo&s;ed that one of their objects is to advance a part of their troops, and &s;eize on the bridge over Croton river, that the communication may be cut off with the upper country. To prevent this, a part of our force is detached, with orders to proceed with the utmo&s;t expedition, and to &s;ecure the pa&s;s if po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>We are trying to remove, to guard again&s;t their de&s;igns, but are greatly impeded by rea&s;on of the &s;carcity of waggons in pro|portion to our baggage and &s;tores. Every exertion has been em|ployed to obtain a &s;ufficiency; but they cannot be had in this part of the country. The quarter-ma&s;ter has &s;ent to Connecticut to get a &s;upply if po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Our army is decrea&s;ing fa&s;t. Several gentlemen, who have come to camp within a few days, have ob&s;erved large numbers of militia returning home on the different roads: nor are any mea&s;ures taken as yet to rai&s;e the new army, no commi&s;&s;ions having come from the &s;tates to appoint or &s;ignify the nomination of their officers. If this was done, perhaps many who are now here might be induced to engage: but at pre&s;ent there are none authori&s;ed to recruit.</P>

<P>My letters of the twenty-ninth and of ye&s;terday, which I had the honor of addre&s;&s;ing you, will give a pretty full account of our &s;ituation, and of every matter re&s;pecting this army, an|tecedent to this date.

&s;uch ca&s;e, tho&s;e who are di&s;charged as unfit for &s;ervice may receive their pay as intended; and tho&s;e who return to duty can obtain what was due to them when the regiment was paid, by applying to the payma&s;ter with the officer and &s;urgeon's certificates, or be included in a &s;ub&s;equent ab&s;tract. The inconveniences and abu&s;es which are de&s;igned to be remedied by the&s;e regu|lations, his excellency does not apprehend to ari&s;e &s;o much from nece&s;&s;ity (as incident to the nature of armies), as from the imperfect in&s;titution of the pre&s;ent, and the great mixture and di|ver&s;ity of troops compo&s;ing it, and al&s;o from the inattention of the officers. * * *</P>
<P>The defencele&s;s &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, as communicated by the committee of &s;afety to your honorable body, is a matter of much concern to his excellency, who is not a little aggravated by the part too many &s;eem ready to take in favor of the enemy. He tru&s;ts, however, the defection will be too incon&s;iderale to threat|en any alarming con&s;equences.</P>
<P>Before the receipt of your letter, his excellency had wrote to the commanding officer of the Virginia regiments at Trenton, di|recting him to march them forward towards general Greene's po&s;t, and there remain under his command till further or|ders, unle&s;s &s;pecial in&s;tructions had been or &s;hould be given to the contrary by Congre&s;s, or for their particular de&s;tina|tion.</P>
<P>Agreeable to your reque&s;t, his excellency has con&s;ulted with general Lee upon the be&s;t mode for employing the French gentle|men, and making them &s;erviceable. The re&s;ult is that they &s;hould be appointed to regiments by Congre&s;s according to the ranks they have been plea&s;ed to give them, and with the &s;ame pay as is allowed other officers in &s;uch ca&s;es. Their want of our language is rather an objection: but it is hoped they will attain a &s;ufficient knowledge of it, ere it be long, to be of great &s;ervice; and that, in the interim, their advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance in directing of works may be of u&s;e where they may be &s;tationed.&mdash;With great re&s;pect, I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the honor to inform you that on ye&s;terday morning the enemy made a &s;udden and unexpected movement from the &s;everal po&s;ts they had taken in our front. They
<PB N="250" REF="031423_0249_0FEC5B4C73CB3760">
broke up their whole encampments the preceding night, and have advanced towards King&s;bridge and the North-river. The de|&s;ign of this manoeuvre is a matter of much conjecture and &s;peculation, and cannot be accounted for with any degree of certainty. The grounds we had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of were &s;trong and advantageous, and &s;uch as they could not have gained without much lo&s;s of blood in ca&s;e an attempt had been made. I had taken every precaution to prevent their out-flanking us;&mdash;which may have led to the pre&s;ent mea&s;ure. They may &s;till have in view their original plan, and, by a &s;ud|den wheel, try to accompli&s;h it. Detachments are con&s;tantly out to ob&s;erve their motions, and to harra&s;s them as much as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this movement I called a council of general officers to-day, to con&s;ult of &s;uch mea&s;ures as &s;hould be adopted in ca&s;e they pur&s;ued their retreat to New-York; the re&s;ult of which is herewith tran&s;mitted. In re&s;pect to my&s;elf, I can|not indulge an idea that general Howe, &s;uppo&s;ing he is go|ing to New-York, means to clo&s;e the campaign, and to &s;it down without attempting &s;omething more. I think it highly proba|ble, and almo&s;t certain, that he will make a de&s;cent with a part of his troops into Jer&s;ey; and, as &s;oon as I am &s;atisfied that the pre&s;ent manoeuvre is real and not a feint, I &s;hall u&s;e every means in my power to forward a part of our force to coun|teract his de&s;igns; nor &s;hall I be di&s;appointed if he &s;ends a detach|ment to the &s;outhward for the purpo&s;e of making a winter cam|paign.</P>
<P>From the information I have received, there is now a number of tran&s;ports at Red-Hook, with about three thou&s;and troops on board. Their de&s;tination, as given out, is to Rhode-I&s;land; but this &s;eems altogether improbable for various rea&s;ons; a|mong others, the &s;ea&s;on is much again&s;t it. In the &s;outhern &s;tates they will find it milder, and much more favorable for their purpo&s;es. I &s;hall take the liberty of mentioning that it may not be improper to &s;ugge&s;t the probability of &s;uch a mea&s;ure to the a&s;&s;emblies and conventions in tho&s;e &s;tates, that they may be on their guard,&mdash;and the propriety of their e&s;tabli&s;hing and laying up magazines of provi&s;ions and other nece&s;&s;aries in &s;uitable places. This is a matter of exceeding importance, and what cannot be too much attended to.</P>
<P>From the approaching di&s;&s;olution of the army, and the depar|ture of the new levies which is on the eve of taking place, and the little pro&s;pect of levying a new one in time, I have wrote to the ea&s;tern &s;tates by the unanimous advice of the ge|neral
<PB N="251" REF="031423_0250_0FEC5B4E544525E0">
officers, to forward &s;upplies of militia in the room of tho&s;e that are now here, and who, it is feared, will not be prevailed on to &s;tay any longer than the time they are engaged for. The pro|priety of this application, I tru&s;t, will appear, when it is known that not a &s;ingle officer is yet commi&s;&s;ioned to recruit, and when it is con&s;idered how e&s;&s;ential it is to keep up &s;ome &s;hew of force and &s;hadow of an army.</P>
<P>I expect the enemy will bend their force again&s;t Fort-Wa&s;hing|ton, and inve&s;t it immediately. From &s;ome advices it is an ob|ject that will attract their earlie&s;t attention.</P>
<P>I am happy to inform you, that, in the engagement on monday &s;e'nnight, I have rea&s;on to believe our lo&s;s was by no means &s;o con&s;iderable as was conjectured at fir&s;t. By &s;ome de&s;erters and pri&s;oners we are told, that of the enemy was tolerably great; &s;ome accounts make it about four hundred in killed and wounded: all agree that among the former there was a colonel Carr of the thirty-fifth regiment.</P>
<P>The force that will be &s;ent to Jer&s;ey after I am &s;atisfied of Mr. Howe's retreat, in addition to tho&s;e now there, according to my pre&s;ent opinion, will make it nece&s;&s;ary for me to go with them, to put things in a proper channel, and &s;uch a way of defence as &s;hall &s;eem mo&s;t probable to check the progre&s;s of the enemy, in ca&s;e they &s;hould attempt a de&s;cent there, or a move to|ward Philadelphia.</P>

<P>By every information I can obtain, and the accounts I had la&s;t night by two de&s;erters who were very intelligent and par|ticular, general Howe &s;till has in view an expedition to the Jer|&s;eys, and is preparing for it with the greate&s;t indu&s;try. I have detached the fir&s;t divi&s;ion of our troops which was thought nece&s;|&s;ary to be &s;ent, and which I hope will cro&s;s the river at Peek&s;|kill to-day. The &s;econd, I expect, will all march this even|ing; and to-morrow morning I propo&s;e to follow my&s;elf, in order to put things in the be&s;t train I can, and to give him every po&s;&s;ible oppo&s;ition.&mdash;I hope (when the two divi&s;ions arrive, and are joined to &s;uch other force as I expect to collect) to check his progre&s;s and prevent him from penetrating any di&s;tance from the river, if not to oblige him to return immediately with &s;ome lo&s;s.

<P>I HAVE only time to acknowledge the honor of your letter of the fifth in&s;tant, and its &s;everal inclo&s;ures, and to inform you, that, agreeable to the re&s;olves of Congre&s;s, I &s;hall u&s;e every mea&s;ure in my power that the moving and pre&s;ent confu&s;ed &s;tate of the army will admit of, to appoint officers for re|cruiting.</P>
<P>You will have been advi&s;ed, before this, of the arrival of commi&s;&s;ioners from the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. Others have come from Connecticut: but, from the pre&s;ent appearance of things, we &s;eem but little if any nearer to levying an army. I had anticipa|ted the re&s;olve re&s;pecting the militia, by writing to the ea&s;tern &s;tates and to the Jer&s;ey, by the advice of my general offi|cers,
<PB N="253" REF="031423_0252_0FEC5B5733FAF9F0">
and from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the nece&s;&s;ity of getting in a number of men if po&s;&s;ible, to keep up the appearance of an ar|my. How my application will &s;ucceed, the event mu&s;t deter|mine. I have little or no rea&s;on to expect that the militia now here will remain a day longer than the time they fir&s;t engaged for. I have recommended their &s;tay, and reque&s;ted it in general orders. General Lincoln and the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts commi&s;&s;ioners are u&s;ing their intere&s;t with tho&s;e from that &s;tate: but, as far as I can judge, we cannot rely on their &s;taying.</P>
<P>I left White-Plains about eleven o'clock ye&s;terday;&mdash;all peace then. The enemy appeared to be preparing for their expedition to Jer&s;ey according to every information. What their de&s;igns are, or whether their pre&s;ent conduct is not a feint, I can|not determine.</P>
<P>The Maryland and Virginia troops under lord Sterling have cro&s;&s;ed the river, as have part of the&s;e from the Jer&s;ey: the re|mainder are now embarking. The troops, judged nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure the &s;everal po&s;ts through the Highlands, have al&s;o got up. I am going to examine the pa&s;&s;es, and direct &s;uch works as may appear nece&s;&s;ary; after which, and making the be&s;t di&s;|po&s;ition I can of things in this quarter, I intend to proceed to Jer&s;ey, which I expect to do to-morrow.</P>
<P>The A&s;&s;emblies of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and Connecticut, to induce their men more readily to en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">age in the &s;ervice, have voted an advance pay of twenty &s;hillings per month, in addition to that allowed by the Congre&s;s to privates. It may perhaps be the means of their levying the quotas exacted from them &s;ooner than they could otherwi&s;e have been rai&s;ed: but I am of opini|on, a more fatal and mi&s;taken policy could not have entered their councils, or one more detrimental to the general cau&s;e. The influence of the vote will become continental, and materi|ally effect the other &s;tates in making up their levies. If they could do it, I am certain, when the troops come to act toge|ther, that jealou&s;y, impatience and mutiny, would nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;e. A different pay cannot exi&s;t in the &s;ame army. The rea|&s;ons are obvious, and experience has proved their force in the ca&s;e of the ea&s;tern and &s;outhern troops la&s;t &s;pring. Sen&s;i|ble of this, and of the pernicious con&s;equences that would in|evitably re&s;ult from the advance, I have prevented the com|mi&s;&s;ioners from proceeding or publi&s;hing their terms till they could obtain the &s;en&s;e of Congre&s;s upon the &s;ubject, and remon|&s;trated again&s;t it in a letter to governor Trumbull. I am not &s;ingular in opinion: I have the concurrence of all the general offi|cers, of its fatal tendency.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the honor to inform you of my arrival here ye&s;|terday, and that the whole of the troops belonging to the &s;tates, which lay &s;outh of Hud&s;on's river, and which were in New|York government, have pa&s;&s;ed over to this &s;ide, except the re|giment, lately colonel Smallwood's, which I expect is now on their march.</P>
<P>That they may be ready to check any incur&s;ion the enemy may attempt in this neighborhood, I intend to quarter them at Brun&s;wick, Amboy, Elizabeth-Town, Newark, and about this place, unle&s;s Congre&s;s &s;hould conceive it nece&s;&s;ary for any of them to be &s;tationed at or more contiguous to Philadelphia. In &s;uch ca&s;e they will be plea&s;ed to &s;ignify their plea&s;ure. There will be very few of them after the departure of tho&s;e who were engaged for the flying camp, which is fa&s;t approach|ing. The di&s;po&s;ition I have mentioned &s;eems to me well cal|culated for the end propo&s;ed, and al&s;o for their acccommoda|tion.</P>
<P>The movements and de&s;igns of the enemy are not yet under|&s;tood. Various are the opinions and reports on this head. From every information, the whole have removed from Dobbs's fer|ry towards King&s;bridge: and it &s;eems to be generally believed on all hands, that the inve&s;ting of Fort-Wa&s;hington is one ob|ject they have in view; but that can employ but a &s;mall part of their force. Whether they intend a &s;outhern expedition, mu&s;t be determined by time: to me there appears a probability of it, which &s;eems to be favored by the advices we have that ma|ny tran&s;ports are wooding and watering. General Greene's letter would give you the &s;ub&s;tance of the intelligence brought by Mr. Mer&s;ereau from Staten-I&s;land in this in&s;tance, which he received before it came to me.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed you have copies of two letters from general Howe, and of my an&s;wer to the fir&s;t of them. The letter alluded to, and returned in his la&s;t, was one from my&s;elf to Mrs. Wa&s;hing|ton, of the twenty-fifth ultimo, from whence I conclude that all the letters which went by the Bo&s;ton expre&s;s have come to his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. You will al&s;o perceive that general Howe has re|que&s;ted
<PB N="255" REF="031423_0254_0FEC5B5B5BD06C20">
the return of Peter Jack, a &s;ervant to major Stewart, to which I have con&s;ented, as he was not in the military line, and the requi&s;ition agreeable to the cu&s;tom of war. This &s;ervant hav|ing been &s;ent to Philadelphia with the Waldeckers and other pri&s;|oners, I mu&s;t reque&s;t the favor of you to have him conveyed to general Greene by the earlie&s;t opportunity, in order that he may be returned to his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I beg leave not only to &s;ugge&s;t but to urge the nece&s;&s;ity of increa&s;ing our field artillery very con&s;ider|bly. Experience has convinced me, as it has every gentleman of di&s;cernment in this army, that, while we remain &s;o much inferior to the enemy in this in&s;tance, we mu&s;t carry on the war under infinite di&s;advantages, and without the &s;malle&s;t probability of &s;ucce&s;s. It has been peculiarly owing to the &s;ituation of the country where their operations have been conducted, and to the rough and &s;trong grounds we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed our&s;elves of, and over which they had to pa&s;s, that they have not carried their arms, by means of their artillery, to a much greater extent. When the&s;e difficulties cea&s;e by changing the &s;cene of action to a level campaign country, the wor&s;t of con&s;equences are to be apprehended. I would therefore, with the concurrence of all the officers whom I have &s;poken to upon the &s;ubject, &s;ubmit to the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s whether immediate mea&s;ures ought not to be taken for procuring a re&s;pectable train.</P>
<P>It is agreed on all hands that each battalion &s;hould be fur|ni&s;hed at lea&s;t with two pieces, and that a &s;maller number than a hundred of three pounds, fifty of &s;ix pounds, and fifty of twelve pounds, &s;hould not be provided, in addition to tho&s;e we now have. Be&s;ides the&s;e, if &s;ome eighteen and twenty-four-pounders are ordered, the train will be more &s;erviceable and complete. The whole &s;hould be of bra&s;s, for the mo&s;t obvious rea&s;ons; they will be much more portable, not half &s;o liable to bur&s;t; and, when they do, no damage is occa&s;ioned by it, and they may be ca&s;t over again. The &s;izes before de&s;cribed &s;hould be particularly attended to: if they are not, there will be great rea&s;on to expect mi&s;takes and confu&s;ion in the charges in time of action, as it has frequently happened in the be&s;t-regulated armies. The di&s;parity between tho&s;e I have mentioned and &s;uch as are of an intermediate &s;ize is difficult to di&s;cern.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o agreed that a regiment of artilleri&s;ts, with approved and experienced officers, &s;hould be obtained if po&s;&s;ible, and &s;ome engineers of known reputation and abilities. I am &s;orry to &s;ay, too ready an indulgence has been had to &s;everal appointments in
<PB N="256" REF="031423_0255_0FEC5B6108DC0D18">
the latter in&s;tance, and that men have been promoted, who &s;eem to me to know but very little if any thing of the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Perhaps this train, &amp;c. may be looked upon by &s;ome as large and expen&s;ive. True, it will be &s;o: but when it is con&s;idered that the enemy, having effected but little in the cour&s;e of the pre|&s;ent campaign, will u&s;e their utmo&s;t efforts to &s;ubjugate us in the next; every con&s;ideration of that &s;ort &s;hould be di&s;regarded, and every po&s;&s;ible preparation made to fru&s;trate their * * * at|tempts. How they are to be procured, is to be enquired into.&mdash;That we cannot provide them among our&s;elves, or more than a very &s;mall proportion, &s;o trifling as not to de&s;erve our notice, is evident. Therefore I would advi&s;e, with all imaginable defer|ence, that, without any abatement of our own internal exertions, application &s;hould be immediately made to &s;uch powers as can and may be willing to &s;upply them. They cannot be obtained too early if &s;oon enough; and I am told they may be ea&s;ily had from France and Holland.</P>
<P>Mr. Trumbull the commi&s;&s;ary-general has frequently mention|ed to me of late the inadequacy of his pay to his trouble and the great ri&s;k he is &s;ubject to on account of the large &s;ums of money which pa&s;s through his hands. He has &s;tated his ca&s;e with a view of laying it before Congre&s;s and obtaining a more adequate compen&s;ation. My &s;entiments upon the &s;ubject are already known: but yet I &s;hall take the liberty to add that I think his complaint to be well founded, and his pay, con&s;idering the im|portant duties and ri&s;ks of his office, by no means &s;ufficient, and that the footing he &s;eems to think it &s;hould be upon, him&s;elf, ap|pears ju&s;t and rea&s;onable.</P>
<P>A propo&s;ition having been made long &s;ince to general Howe and agreed to by him, for an exchange of pri&s;oners in con&s;e|quence of the re&s;olutions of Congre&s;s to that effect, I &s;hall be extremely happy if you will give directions to the committees and tho&s;e having the charge of pri&s;oners in the &s;everal &s;tates &s;outh of Jer&s;ey, to tran&s;mit me proper li&s;ts of the names of all the com|mi&s;&s;ioned officers, and of their ranks and the corps they belong to; al&s;o the number of non-commi&s;&s;ioned and privates, and their re&s;|pective regiments. You will perceive by his letter, he &s;uppo&s;es me to have affected &s;ome delay, or to have been unmindful of the propo&s;ition I had made.</P>
<P>I propo&s;e to &s;tay in this neighborhood a few days, in which time I expect the de&s;igns of the enemy will be more di&s;clo&s;ed, and their incur&s;ions be made in this quarter, or their inve&s;titure of Fort Wa&s;h|ington, if they are intended.</P>

<P>HAVING given my promi&s;e to general Howe, on his ap|plication, that Peter Jack, a &s;ervant of major Stewart, who was &s;ent to Philadelphia with the Waldeckers and other pri&s;oners and who has nothing to do in the military line, &s;hould be returned to his ma&s;ter agreeable to the u&s;age of war in &s;uch ca&s;es,&mdash;I mu&s;t take the liberty to reque&s;t the favor of you to have him conveyed to general Greene by the earlie&s;t opportunity, that he may be forwarded to his ma&s;ter in compliance with my pro|mi&s;e.</P>
<P>I al&s;o wi&s;h that you would have all the Briti&s;h pri&s;oners collected that you conveniently can, and &s;ent to me as &s;oon as po&s;&s;i|ble with the He&s;&s;ian pri&s;oners, that I may exchange them. The return of the letter I think will be attended with many &s;alu|tary con&s;equences: but, &s;hould it be made without that of a large proportion of other troops, it will carry the marks of de&s;ign, and occa&s;ion precautions to be taken to prevent the ends we have in view.&mdash;I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I had the honor of addre&s;&s;ing you la&s;t, an important event has taken place, of which I wi&s;h to give you the earlie&s;t intelligence.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ervation of the pa&s;&s;age of the North-river was an object of &s;o much con&s;equence that I thought no pains or expen&s;e too great for that purpo&s;e: and therefore, after &s;ending off all the valuable &s;tores except &s;uch as were nece&s;&s;ary for its defence, I determined, agreeable to the advice of mo&s;t of the general officers, to ri&s;k &s;omething to defend the po&s;t on the ea&s;t &s;ide, called Mount-Wa&s;hington.</P>
<P>When the army moved up in con&s;equence of general Howe's landing at Frog-Point, colonel Magaw was left on that command, with about twelve hundred men, and orders given to de|fend it to the la&s;t. Afterwards, reflecting upon the &s;mallne&s;s of the garri&s;on, and the difficulty of their holding it if general Howe &s;hould fall down upon it with his whole force, I wrote to general Greene who had the command on the Jer&s;ey &s;hore, directing him to govern him&s;elf by circum&s;tances, and to retain or evacuate the po&s;t as he &s;hould think be&s;t, and revoking the ab&s;olute order to colonel Magaw to defend the po&s;t to the la&s;t ex|tremity.&mdash;General Greene, &s;truck with the importance of the po&s;t, and the di&s;engagement which our evacuation of po&s;ts mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have given, reinforced colonel Magaw with de|tachments from &s;everal regiments of the flying camp, but chiefly of Penn&s;ylvania, &s;o as to make up the number about two thou&s;and.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation things were ye&s;terday, when general Howe de|manded the &s;urrendry of the garri&s;on, to which colonel Magaw re|turned a &s;pirited refu&s;al. Immediately upon receiving an ac|count of this tran&s;action, I came from Hackin&s;ac to this place, and had partly cro&s;&s;ed the North-river when I met general Putnam and general Greene, who were ju&s;t returning from thence, and informed me that the troops were in high &s;pi|rits, and would make a good defence: and it being late at night, I returned.</P>
<P>Early this morning colonel Magaw po&s;ted his troops partly in the lines thrown up by our army on our fir&s;t coming thither from New-York, and partly on a commanding hill lying north of Mount-Wa&s;hington,&mdash;the lines being all to the &s;outhward. In this po&s;ition the attack began about ten o'clock, which our troops &s;tood, and returned the fire in &s;uch a manner as gave me great hopes the enemy was entirely repul&s;ed. But at this
<PB N="259" REF="031423_0259_0FEC5B69AD74BFD0">
time a body of troops cro&s;&s;ed Haerlem-river in boats and landed in&s;ide of the &s;econd lines, our troops being then engaged in the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Colonel Cadwallader, who commanded in the lines, &s;ent off a detachment to oppo&s;e them: but they, being overpowered by numbers, gave way; upon which, colonel Cadwallader order|ed his troops to retreat in order to gain the fort. It was done with much confu&s;ion; and the enemy cro&s;&s;ing over came in upon them in &s;uch a manner, that a number of them &s;urrender|ed.</P>
<P>At this time the He&s;&s;ians advanced on the north &s;ide of the fort in a very large body. They were received by the troops po&s;ted there, with proper &s;pirit, and kept back a con&s;iderable time: but at length they were al&s;o obliged to &s;ubmit to a &s;uperi|ority of numbers, and retire under the cannon of the fort.</P>
<P>The enemy, having advanced thus far, halted; and immedi|ately a flag went in, with a repetition of the demand of the fortre&s;s, as I &s;uppo&s;e. At this time I &s;ent a billet to colonel Magaw, directing him to hold out, and I would endeavor this evening to bring off the garri&s;on, if the fortre&s;s could not be maintained, as I did not expect it could, the enemy being po&s;&s;e&s;s|ed of the adjacent ground. But, before this reached him he had entered too far into a treaty, to retract; after which, colo|nel Cadwallader told another me&s;&s;enger who went over, that they had been able to obtain no other terms than to &s;urren|der as pri&s;oners of war. In this &s;ituation matters now &s;tand. I have &s;topped general Beall's and general Heard's brigades to pre|&s;erve the po&s;t and &s;tores here; which, with the other troops, I hope we &s;hall be able to effect.</P>
<P>I do not yet know the numbers killed or wounded on either &s;ide: but, from the heavine&s;s and continuance of the fire in &s;ome places, I imagine there mu&s;t have been con&s;iderable execu|tion.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of &s;uch a number of officers and men, many of whom have been trained with more than common attention, will, I fear, be &s;everely felt; but, when that of the arms and accoutre|ments is added, much more &s;o; and mu&s;t be a further incentive to procure as con&s;iderable a &s;upply as po&s;&s;ible for the new troops, as &s;oon as it can be done.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE not yet been able to obtain a particular account of the unhappy affair of the &s;ixteenth, nor of the terms on which the garri&s;on &s;urrendered. The intelligence that has come to hand is not &s;o full and accurate as I could wi&s;h. One of the artillery, who&s;e information is mo&s;t direct, and who e&s;|caped on &s;unday night, &s;ays the enemy's lo&s;s was very con|&s;iderable, e&s;pecially in the attack made above the fort by the divi|&s;ion of He&s;&s;ians that marched from King&s;bridge, and where lieu|tenant-colonel Rawlins, of the late colonel Stephen&s;on's regiment, was po&s;ted.</P>
<P>They burned ye&s;terday one or two hou&s;es on the heights, and contiguous to the fort, and appeared, by advices from general Greene, to be moving in the evening their main body down to|wards the city Whether they will clo&s;e the campaign without at|tempting &s;omething more, or make an incur&s;ion into jer&s;ey, mu&s;t be determined by the events them&s;elves.</P>
<P>As Fort-Lee was always con&s;idered as only nece&s;&s;ary in con|junction with that on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the river, to pre&s;erve the com|munication acro&s;s, and to prevent the enemy from a free na|vigation, it has become of no importance by the lo&s;s of the other, or not &s;o material as to employ force for its defence. Being viewed in this light, and apprehending that the &s;tores there would be precariou&s;ly &s;ituated, their removal has been de|termined on to Boundbrook above Brun&s;wic, Princeton, Spring|field, and Aquackenunk-bridge, as places that will not be &s;ub|ject to &s;udden danger in ca&s;e the enemy &s;hould pa&s;s the riv|er, and which have been thought proper as repo&s;itories for &s;ome of our &s;tores of provi&s;ion and forage.</P>
<P>The troops belonging to the flying camp under generals Heard and Beall, with what remains of general Ewing's brigade, are now at Fort-Lee, where they will continue till the &s;tores are got away. By the time that is effected, their term of enli&s;tment will be near expiring; and, if the enemy &s;hould make a pu&s;h in this quarter, the only troops that there will be to oppo&s;e them, will be Hand's, Hazlett's, the regiment from Virginia, and that, lately Smallwood's,&mdash;the latter greatly re|duced by the lo&s;&s;es it &s;u&s;tained on Long-I&s;land, &amp;c. and &s;ick|ne&s;s: nor are the re&s;t by any means complete. In addition to the&s;e, I am told there are a few of the militia of this &s;tate, who have been called in by governor Living&s;ton. I &s;hall make &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition of the whole at Brun&s;wic and at the interme|diate po&s;ts, as &s;hall &s;eem mo&s;t likely to guard again&s;t the de|&s;igns
<PB N="261" REF="031423_0262_0FEC5B6F8551CD18">
of the enemy, and to prevent them making an irruption or foraging with detached parties.</P>
<P>The inclo&s;ed letter from colonels Miles and Atlee will &s;hew Congre&s;s the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation of our pri&s;oners in New-York; and their di&s;tre&s;s will become greater every day by the cold inclement &s;ea&s;on that is approaching. It will be happy if &s;ome expedient can be adopted, by which they may be furni&s;hed with nece&s;&s;ary blankets and clothing. Humanity and the good of the &s;ervice require it.&mdash;I think the mode &s;ugge&s;ted by the&s;e gentlemen, for e&s;tabli&s;hing a credit, appears as likely to &s;uc|ceed, and as eligible, as any that occurs to me. It is probable many articles that may be wanted can be obtained there, and up|on better terms than el&s;ewhere. In re&s;pect to provi&s;ion, their al|lowance perhaps is as good as the &s;ituation of general Howe's &s;tores will admit of: it has been &s;aid of late by de&s;erters and others that they were rather &s;cant.</P>
<P>By a letter from the pay-ma&s;ter-general, of the &s;eventeenth, he &s;ays there will be a nece&s;&s;ity that large and early remittan|ces &s;hould be made. The demands, when the troops now in &s;ervice are di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, will be extremely great. Be&s;ides, the bounty recruits will require a large &s;upply; and he adds that the commi&s;&s;ary general has informed him, that, between this and the la&s;t of December, he &s;hall have occa&s;ion for a million of dol|lars.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 21.&mdash;The unhappy affair of the &s;ixteenth has been &s;ucceeded by further misfortunes. Ye&s;terday morning a large body of the enemy landed between Dobbs's ferry and Fort-Lee. Their object was, evidently, to enclo&s;e the whole of our troops and &s;tores that lay between the North and Hack|in&s;ac rivers, which form a very narrow neck of land. For this purpo&s;e they formed and marched as &s;oon as they had a&s;cended the high grounds towards the fort. Upon the fir&s;t information of their having landed, and of their movements, our men were ordered to meet them; but finding their num|bers greatly &s;uperior, and that they were extending them&s;elves to &s;eize on the pa&s;&s;es over the river, it was thought prudent to withdraw our men; which was effected, and their retreat &s;ecured. We lo&s;t the whole of the cannon that was at the fort (except two twelve-pounders) and a great deal of baggage, between two and three hundred tents, about a thou&s;and barrels of flour, and other &s;tores in the quarter-ma&s;ter's department. This lo&s;s was inevitable. As many of the &s;tores had been remov|ed as circum&s;tances and time would admit of. The ammunition had been happily got away.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="031423_0263_0FEC5B75497F88A8">
Our pre&s;ent &s;ituation between Hackin&s;ac and Pa&s;&s;aic rivers being exactly &s;imilar to our late one, and our force here by no means adequate to an oppo&s;ition that will promi&s;e the &s;malle&s;t pro|bability of &s;ucce&s;s, we are taking mea&s;ures to retire over the wa|ters of the latter, when the be&s;t di&s;po&s;ition will be formed that circum&s;tances will admit of.</P>
<P>By colonel Cadwallader, who has been permitted by general Howe to return to his friends, I am informed the &s;urrender of the garri&s;on on the &s;ixteenth was on the common terms as pri|&s;oners of war; the lo&s;s of the He&s;&s;ians, about three hundred privates and twenty-&s;even officers killed and wounded; about forty of the Briti&s;h troops, and two or three officers: the lo&s;s on our &s;ide but incon&s;iderable. I beg leave to refer you to him for a more particular account, and al&s;o for his relation of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of our pri&s;oners.&mdash;Colonels Miles and Atlee's letter, mentioned above upon this &s;ubject, was through mi&s;take &s;ent from hence ye&s;terday morning. The mode of relief propo&s;ed by them was a credit or &s;upply of ca&s;h through the means of Mr. Franks. This &s;eems to be doubtful, as he is &s;aid to be in confine|ment by colonel Cadwallader,&mdash;provided it would have been other|wi&s;e practicable.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE not yet heard that any provi&s;ions is making to &s;upply the place of the troops compo&s;ing the flying camp, who&s;e departure is now at hand. The &s;ituation of our affairs is truly critical, and &s;uch as requires uncommon exertions on our part. From the movements of the enemy, and the information we have received, they certainly will make a pu&s;h to po&s;&s;e&s;s them|&s;elves of this part of the Jer&s;ey.&mdash;In order that you may be ful|ly appri&s;ed of our weakne&s;s, and of the nece&s;&s;ity there is of our obtaining early &s;uccours, I have by the advice of the general of|ficers here, directed general Mifflin to wait on you. He is inti|mately acquainted with our circum&s;tances, and will repre&s;ent them better than my hurried &s;tate will allow.</P>
<P>I have wrote to general Lee to come over with the conti|nental regiments immediately under his command: tho&s;e with general Heath I have ordered to &s;ecure the pa&s;&s;es through the
<PB N="263" REF="031423_0264_0FEC5B76D2932080">
Highlands. I have al&s;o wrote to governor Living&s;ton reque&s;ting of him &s;uch aid as may be in his power; and would &s;ubmit it to the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s whether application &s;hould not be made for part of Penn&s;ylvania militia to &s;tep forth at this pre&s;|&s;ing time.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I would mention, if an early and imme|diate &s;upply of money could be &s;ent to Mr. Dalham to pay the flying-camp troops, it might have a happy effect. They would &s;ub&s;i&s;t them&s;elves comfortably on their return, provide many nece&s;&s;aries of which they are in great want; and moreover it might be the means of inducing many, after &s;eeing their friends, to engage again.</P>
<P>I expected, on coming here, to have met with many of the militia, but find from inquiry that there are not more than from four to five hundred at the different po&s;ts.</P>

<P>I DO my&s;elf the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of the twenty-fir&s;t and twenty-fourth, with their &s;everal inclo&s;ures. The execution of the re&s;olves has been and will be at|tended to as far as in my power.</P>
<P>I have wrote to general Schuyler to &s;end down as early as po&s;&s;i|ble the troops in the northern department from this and the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania. The propo&s;ition for exchanging Mr. Franklin for general Thomp&s;on I &s;hall &s;ubmit to general Howe, as &s;oon as cir|cum&s;tances will allow me.</P>
<P>I have nothing in particular to advi&s;e you of, re&s;pecting the enemy, more than they are advancing this way. Part of them have pa&s;&s;ed the Pa&s;&s;aic; and I &s;uppo&s;e the main body that they have on this &s;ide the North-river would have done the &s;ame before now (as they are coming on), had their progre&s;s not been retarded by the weather which has been rainy for &s;everal days pa&s;t, I have &s;couts and detachments con&s;tantly out to harra&s;s them and watch their motions, and to gain, if po&s;&s;ible, intelligence of their de&s;igns.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been honored with your favor of the twenty-&s;ixth, and with its inclo&s;ures, by which I perceive the mea&s;ures that have been adopted for forwarding a reinforcement of militia. Their arrival is much to be wi&s;hed, the &s;ituation of our affairs being truly alarming, and &s;uch as demands the earlie&s;t aids. As general Mifflin's pre&s;ence may have a happy influence on the di&s;|po&s;ition and temper of many of the a&s;&s;ociators, I &s;hall not direct his return &s;o long as he can be done without, and till it becomes indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>On thur&s;day morning I left Newark, and arrived here ye&s;ter|day with the troops that were there. It was the opinion of all the generals who were with me, that a retreat to this place was requi&s;ite, and founded in nece&s;&s;ity, as our force was by no means &s;ufficient to make a &s;tand, with the lea&s;t probability of &s;ucce&s;s, again&s;t an enemy much &s;uperior in number, and who&s;e advanced guards were entering the town by the time our rear got out. It was the wi&s;h of all to have remained there longer, and to have halted before we came thus far; but, upon due con&s;idera|tion of our &s;trength, the circum&s;tances attending the enli&s;tment of a great part of our little force, and the frequent advices that the enemy were embarking or about to embark another detach|ment for Staten-I&s;land with a view of landing at Amboy to co|operate with this, which &s;eemed to be confirmed by the infor|mation of &s;ome per&s;ons who came from the i&s;land, that they were collecting and impre&s;&s;ing all the waggons they could find,&mdash;it was judged nece&s;&s;ary to proceed till we came here, not only to prevent their bringing a force to act upon our front and rear, but al&s;o that we might be more convenient to oppo&s;e any troops they might land at South-Amboy, which many conjectured to be an object they had in view. This conjecture too had probability and &s;ome advices to &s;upport it.</P>
<P>I hoped we &s;hould have met with large and early &s;uccours by this time; but as yet no great number of the militia of this
<PB N="265" REF="031423_0266_0FEC5B7DB98A4150">
&s;tate has come in; nor have I much rea&s;on to expect that any con&s;iderable aid will be derived from the counties which lie be|yond this river, and in which the enemy are. Their &s;ituation will prevent it in a great mea&s;ure from tho&s;e parts where they are, provided the inclinations of the people were good. Added to this, I have no a&s;&s;urances that more than a very few of the troops com|po&s;ing the flying camp will remain after the time of their engage|ment is out: &s;o far from it, I am told that &s;ome of general Ew|ing's brigade, who &s;tand engaged to the fir&s;t of January, are now going away. If tho&s;e go who&s;e &s;ervice expires this day, our force will be reduced to a mere handful.</P>
<P>From intelligence received this morning, one divi&s;ion of the enemy was advancing la&s;t night as far as Elizabeth-town, and &s;ome of their quarter-ma&s;ters had proceeded about four or five miles, on this &s;ide, to provide barns, &amp;c. for their accommoda|tion. Other accounts &s;ay another divi&s;ion, compo&s;ed of He&s;&s;i|ans, are on the road through Springfield, and are reported to have reached that place la&s;t night. I do not know how far their views extend; but I doubt not, they mean to pu&s;h eve|ry advantage re&s;ulting from the &s;mall number and &s;tate of our troops.</P>
<P>I early began to forward part of the &s;tores from this place to|wards Philadelphia. Many are gone: the re&s;t we are removing, and hope to &s;ecure.</P>

<P>I AM to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twenty-third in&s;tant, which, from the un&s;ettled &s;ituation of our affairs, I have not been able to an|&s;wer before. That of the eighteenth inclo&s;es a li&s;t of &s;tores [<HI>imported</HI>] in the Hancock-and-Adams continental &s;hip, and car|ried into Dartmouth in New-England,&mdash;with a re&s;olve of Con|gre&s;s to deliver the mu&s;kets, powder, lead, and flints, to my or|der. As the other articles of the cargo will be full as u&s;eful
<PB N="266" REF="031423_0267_0FEC5B80E7EDF838">
to the army as tho&s;e included in the re&s;olve, I would advi&s;e that directions be given to have the whole cargo removed from Dartmouth to &s;ome &s;ecure place in the neighborhood of Philadel|phia, and there depo&s;ited till called for. It is by no means proper that &s;o great a quantity of military &s;tores &s;hould be lodged with the army, e&s;pecially at pre&s;ent, as we know not to-day where we &s;hall be obliged to remove to-morrow: and that will in all proba|bility be the ca&s;e while the enemy continue with a light army on this &s;ide the North-River.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to that part of yours of the nineteenth in which you a&s;k my advice as to the propriety of enli&s;ting pri&s;oners of war, I would ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that, in my opinion, it is neither con|&s;i&s;tent with the rules of war, nor politic: nor can I think, that becau&s;e our enemies have committed an unju&s;tifiable action, by enticing, and, in &s;ome in&s;tances, intimidating our men in their &s;ervice, we ought to follow their example. Before I had the honor of yours on this &s;ubject, I had determined to remon&s;trate to general Howe on this head. As to tho&s;e few who have al|ready enli&s;ted, I would not have them again withdrawn and &s;ent in, becau&s;e they might be &s;ubjected to puni&s;hment: but I would have the practice di&s;continued in future. If you will revert to the capitulation of St. John's and Chamblee, you will find an expre&s;s &s;tipulation again&s;t the enli&s;ting the pri&s;oners taken there.</P>
<P>I remarked that the enli&s;tment of pri&s;oners was not a politic &s;tep:&mdash;my rea&s;on is this, that in time of danger I have always ob&s;erved &s;uch per&s;ons mo&s;t backward, for fear (I &s;uppo&s;e) of falling into the hands of their former ma&s;ters, from whom they expect no mercy: and this fear they are apt to communicate to their fellow-&s;oldiers. They are al&s;o mo&s;t ready to de&s;ert when any action is expected, hoping, by carrying intelligence, to &s;e|cure their peace.</P>
<P>I met captain He&s;keth on the road; and as the &s;ituation of his family did not admit of delay, I permitted him to go imme|diately to New-York, not having the lea&s;t doubt but general Howe will make a return of any officer of equal rank who &s;hall be required.</P>

<P>I YESTERDAY had the honor of writing you, and to advi&s;e you of our arrival here. I am now to inform you that

the enemy are &s;till advancing, and that their van-guard had proceeded as far as Bonem, a &s;mall town about four miles this &s;ide of Woodbridge, according to my la&s;t intelligence. As to their number, reports are various. Some &s;ay they were joined ye&s;terday by a con&s;iderable reinforcement from Staten-I&s;land. How far this fact may be true, I cannot determine: but, from every information, before, they were between &s;ix and &s;even thou|&s;and &s;trong.</P>
<P>I have for &s;ome time pa&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed Philadelphia to be the ob|ject of their movement, and have every rea&s;on to believe my opinion well founded,&mdash;the advices of &s;undry per&s;ons, who have had an opportunity of mixing and conver&s;ing with them on the march, agreeing that &s;uch is the report. I have wrote to govern|or Living&s;ton upon the &s;ubject, reque&s;ting his utmo&s;t exertions to forward on every &s;uccour in his power. The &s;ame, I tru&s;t, will be attended to in Penn&s;ylvania. Without a &s;ufficient number of men and arms, their progre&s;s cannot be checked:&mdash;at pre&s;ent our force is totally inadequate to any attempt.</P>
<P>Several officers belonging to the enemy, who were pri&s;oners, have obtained permi&s;&s;ion to return. I have not yet &s;ent in the names of tho&s;e belonging to us, that are to be exchanged for them. By a Virginia paper, I perceive that captain Morgan and lieutenant Heath, who were taken pri&s;oners at Quebec, and now on parole, are promoted in the late arrangement of officers in that &s;tate,&mdash;the former to a regiment, the latter to a majority. It would be well if they were relea&s;ed: but being Virginians, and not knowing that any gentleman who were taken at the &s;ame time are &s;o circum&s;tanced, I have declined claiming their return without the opinion of Congre&s;s, le&s;t I &s;hould incur the charge of partiality.</P>
<P>I have &s;ent forward colonel Humpton, to collect proper boats and crafts at the ferry, for tran&s;porting our troops: and it will be of infinite importance to have every other craft, be&s;ides what he takes for the above purpo&s;e, &s;ecured on the we&s;t &s;ide of Dela|ware: otherwi&s;e they may fall into the enemy's hands and facili|tate their views.</P>

I have &s;ent colonel Humpton forward to collect the nece&s;&s;ary boats for our tran&s;portation, and conceive it proper that the mili|tia from Penn&s;ylvania &s;hould be ordered towards Trenton, that they may be ready to join us, and act as occa&s;ion may re|quire.</P>

<P>I ARRIVED here my&s;elf ye&s;terday morning with the main body of the army, having left lord Sterling with two brigades at Princeton and that neighborhood, to watch the motions of the en|emy, and give notice of their approach. I am informed that they had not entered Brun&s;wic ye&s;terday morning at nine o'clock, but were on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the Rariton.</P>
<P>Immediately on my arrival here, I ordered the removal of all the military and other &s;tores and baggage over the Dela|ware: a great quantity are already got over; and as &s;oon as boats come up from Philadelphia, we &s;hall load them; by which means I hope to have every thing &s;ecured this night and to|morrow, if we are not di&s;turbed. After being di&s;encumbered of my baggage and &s;tores, my future &s;ituation will depend entirely upon circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>I have not heard a word from General Lee &s;ince the twenty-&s;ixth of la&s;t month; which &s;urpri&s;es me not a little, as I have di&s;|patched daily expre&s;&s;es to him, de&s;iring to know when I might look for him. This makes me fearful that my letters have not reached him. I am informed by report that general St. Clair has joined him with three or four regiments from the northward. To know the truth of this, and al&s;o when I may ex|pect him, and with what numbers, I have this minute di&s;patched colonel Stewart (General Gates's aid-de-camp) to meet general Lee and bring me an account.</P>
<P>I look out earne&s;tly for the reinforcement from Philadelphia. I am in hopes, that, if we can draw a good head of men together, it will give &s;pirits to the militia of this &s;tate, who have as yet af|forded me little or no a&s;&s;i&s;tance; nor can I find they are likely to do much.</P>

<P>SINCE I had the honor of addre&s;&s;ing you ye&s;terday, I recei|ved a letter from General Lee. On the thirtieth ultimo he was at Peek&s;kill, and expected to pa&s;s the river with his divi|&s;ion two days after. From this intelligence you will readily conclude that he will not be able to afford us any aid for &s;everal days. The report of general St. Clair's having joined them with three or four regiments, I believe to be altogether premature, as he mentions nothing of it. It has ari&s;en, as I am inform|ed, from the return of &s;ome of the Jer&s;ey and Penn&s;ylvania troops from Tyconderoga, who&s;e time of &s;ervice is expired. They have reached Pluckemin where I have wrote to have them halted and kept together, if they can be prevailed on, till further orders.</P>
<P>The inclo&s;ed is a copy of a letter which came to hand la&s;t night from major Clark, to which I beg leave to refer you for the intelligence it contains.&mdash;The number of the enemy &s;aid to be embarked is &s;uppo&s;ed to be rather exaggerated. That there has been an embarkation, is not to be doubted, it being confirm|ed through various channels. By colonel Griffin, who went from Brun&s;wic on &s;unday morning with a captain Sims, to pa&s;s him by our guards, and who was detained by lord Cornwallis till monday evening, on account of his &s;ituation, the amount of general Clinton's force, from what he could collect from the officers, was about &s;ix thou&s;and: as to their de&s;tination, he could not obtain the lea&s;t information. By him I al&s;o learn the enemy were in Brun&s;wic, and that &s;ome of their advanced parties had proceeded two miles on this &s;ide. The heavy rain that has fallen has probably checked their progre&s;s, and may prevent their frther movement for &s;ome time,</P>

<P>YOURS of the twentieth of la&s;t month was delivered to me by the brigadier La Roche de Fermoy, who is now here, but unable to render me that &s;ervice, which, I dare &s;ay, from his character, he would, were he better acquainted with our language.</P>
<P>I ye&s;terday received a letter from you without a date, mention|ing that the pri&s;oners from York-town were directed to halt at Newtown for my orders.

<P>I hope you have not &s;ent captain Price, lieutenant Peacock, and major Campbell, on to this place, as it is highly improper they &s;hould &s;ee and know the &s;ituation of our army here and at Prince|ton. They had better be &s;ent up, under the care of &s;ome per&s;on, to Newtown or that neighborhood, and there wait the arrival of &s;ome larger party, who, I imagine, will be &s;oon forwarded from Lanca&s;ter, and go in with them.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS nothing but nece&s;&s;ity obliged me to retire before the enemy and leave &s;o much of the Jer&s;eys unprotected, I conceive it my duty, and it corre&s;ponds with my inclination, to make head again&s;t them &s;o &s;oon as there &s;hall be the lea&s;t probability of doing it with propriety. That the country might in &s;ome mea&s;ure be covered, I left two brigades con&s;i&s;ting of the five Virginia regiments and that of Delaware, containing in the whole about twelve hundred men fit for duty, under the com|mand of lord Sterling and general Stephen, at Princeton, till the baggage and &s;tores could cro&s;s the Delaware, or the troops under their re&s;pective commands &s;hould be forced from thence. I &s;hall now, having removed the greate&s;t part of the above ar|ticles, face about with &s;uch troops as are here fit for &s;ervice, and march back to Princeton, and there govern my&s;elf by cir|cum&s;tances and the movements of general Lee. At any event, the enemy's progre&s;s may be retarded by this means, if they intend to come on, and the people's fears in &s;ome mea&s;ure qui|eted, if they do not. Sorry I am to ob&s;erve, however, that the frequent calls upon the militia of this &s;tate, the want of ex|ertion in the principal gentlemen of the country, or a fatal &s;u|pinene&s;s and in&s;en&s;ibility of danger till it is too late to prevent an evil that was not only fore&s;een but foretold, have been the cau&s;es of our late di&s;graces.</P>
<P>If the militia of this &s;tate had &s;tepped forth in &s;ea&s;on (and timely notice they had), we might have prevented the enemy's cro&s;&s;ing the Hackin&s;ac, although without &s;ome previous notice of the time and place it was impo&s;&s;ible to have done this at the North-river. We might with equal probability of &s;ucce&s;s have made a &s;tand at Brun&s;wic on the Rariton. But as both the&s;e rivers were fordable in a variety of places (knee-deep only), it required many men to defend the pa&s;&s;es; and the&s;e we had not. At Hackin&s;ac our force was in&s;ufficient, becau&s;e a part was at Elizabeth-town, Amboy, and Brun&s;wic, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uarding a coa&s;t which I thought mo&s;t expo&s;ed to danger; and at Brun&s;wic, becau&s;e I was di&s;appointed in my expectation of militia, and becau&s;e on the day of the enemy's approach (and probably the occa&s;ion of it) the term of the Jer&s;ey and Maryland brigade' &s;ervice expired; neither of which would con&s;ent to &s;tay an hour lon|ger.</P>
<P>The&s;e among ten thou&s;and other in&s;tances, might be adduced to &s;hew the di&s;advantages of &s;hort enli&s;tments, and the little de|pendence upon militia in times of real danger. But, as ye&s;ter|day
<PB N="273" REF="031423_0272_0FEC5B9999A00B18">
cannot be recalled, I will not dwell upon a &s;ubject which, no doubt, has given much unea&s;ine&s;s to Congre&s;s, as well as ex|treme pain and anxiety to my&s;elf. My fir&s;t wi&s;h is that Con|gre&s;s may be convinced of the impropriety of relying upon the mi|litia, and of the nece&s;&s;ity of rai&s;ing a larger &s;tanding army than what they have voted. The &s;aving in the articles of &s;tores, provi&s;ions, and in a thou&s;and other things, by having nothing to do with the militia unle&s;s in ca&s;e of extraordinary exigency, and &s;uch as could not be expected in the common cour&s;e of events, would amply &s;upport a large army, which, well officered, would be daily improving, in&s;tead of continuing a de&s;tructive, expen&s;ive, and di&s;orderly mob.</P>
<P>I am clear in opinion, that, if forty thou&s;and men had been kept in con&s;tant pay &s;ince the fir&s;t commencement of ho&s;tilities, and the militia had been excu&s;ed doing duty during that period, the continent would have &s;aved money. When I reflect on the lo&s;&s;es we have &s;u&s;tained for want of good troops, the certainty of this is placed beyond a doubt of my mind. In &s;uch ca&s;e, the militia, who have been harra&s;&s;ed and tired by repeated calls upon them (and farming and manufactures in a manner &s;u&s;pended), would, upon any pre&s;&s;ing emergency, have ran with alacri|ty to arms; whereas the cry now is, "they may be as well ruined one way as another;" and with difficulty they are obtained.</P>
<P>I mention the&s;e things, to &s;hew, that, in my opinion, if any dependence is placed in the militia another year, Congre&s;s will be deceived. When danger is a little removed from them, they will not turn out at all. When it comes home to them, the well-affected; in&s;tead of flying to arms to defend them&s;elves, are bu&s;ily employed in removing their families and effects,&mdash;whil&s;t the di&s;affected are concerting mea&s;ures to make their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and &s;pread terror and di&s;may all around, to induce others to follow the example.&mdash;Daily experience and abundant proofs warrant this information.</P>
<P>I &s;hall this day reinforce lord Sterling with about twelve hun|dred men, which will make his number about two thou&s;and four hundred. To-morrow I mean to repair to Princeton my&s;elf, and &s;hall order the Penn&s;ylvania troops (who are not yet arrived, ex|cept part of the German battalion and a company of light infantry) to the &s;ame place.</P>
<P>By my la&s;t advices, the enemy are &s;till at Brun&s;wic; and the account adds that general Howe was expected at Elizabeth|town with a reinforcement, to erect the king's &s;tandard, and demand a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of this &s;tate. I can only give this as a re|port

<P>COLONEL Reed would inform you of the intelligence which I fir&s;t met with on the road from Trenton to Princeton ye&s;|terday. Before I got to the latter, I received a &s;econd ex|pre&s;s informing me, that as the enemy were advancing by different routes, and attempting by one to get in the rear of our troops which were there (and who&s;e numbers were &s;mall, and the place by no means defen&s;ible), they had judged it prudent to re|treat to Trenton. The retreat was accordingly made, and &s;ince to this &s;ide of the river.</P>
<P>This information I thought it my duty to communicate as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, as there is not a moment's time to be lo&s;t in a&s;&s;embling &s;uch force as can be collected; and as the object of

<P>I have no certain intelligence of general Lee, although I have &s;ent frequent expre&s;&s;es to him, and lately a colonel Humpton to bring me &s;ome accurate accounts of his &s;ituation.

<P>I have this morning detached lord Stirling with his brigade, to take po&s;t at the different landing places, and prevent them from &s;tealing a march upon us from above; for I am informed, if they cro&s;s at Coryel's ferry or thereabouts, they are as near to Phila|delphia, as we are here. From &s;everal accounts I am led to think that the enemy are bringing boats with them: if &s;o it will be im|po&s;&s;ible for our &s;mall force to give them any con&s;iderable op|po&s;ition in the pa&s;&s;age of the river, [<HI>as they may</HI>] make a feint at one place, and, by a &s;udden removal, carry their boats higher or lower before we can bring our cannon to play upon them.</P>

Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, the &s;ecurity of Philadelphia &s;hould be our next object. From my own remembrance, but more from information (for I never viewed the ground) I &s;hould think that a communication of lines and redoubts might &s;oon be form|ed from the Delaware to Schuylkill on the north entrance of the city, the lines to begin on the Schuylkill <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ide, about the heights of Springatebury, and run ea&s;tward to Delaware, upon the mo&s;t advantageous and commanding grounds. If &s;omething of this kind is not done, the enemy might, in ca&s;e any misfortune &s;hould befal us, march directly, in and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. We have ever found that lines, however &s;light, are very formidable to them: they would at lea&s;t give a check till people could recover of the fright and con&s;ternation that naturally attends the fir&s;t appearance of an enemy.</P>
<P>In the mean time every &s;tep &s;hould be taken to collect force, not only from Penn&s;ylvania, but from the mo&s;t neighborly &s;tates. If we can keep the enemy from entering Philadelphia, and keep the communication by water open for &s;upplies, we may yet make a &s;tand, if the country will come to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance till our new levies can be collected.</P>
<P>If the mea&s;ure of fortifying the city &s;hould be adopted, &s;ome &s;kilful per&s;on &s;hould immediately view the grounds, and begin to trace out the lines and works. I am informed there is a French engineer of eminence in Philadelphia at this time: if &s;o he will be the mo&s;t proper.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER I had wrote you ye&s;terday, I received certain in|formation that the enemy, after repairing Crofwix's bridge, had advanced a party of about five hundred to Bordentown. By their taking this route, it confirms me in my opinion, that they have an intention to land between this and Philadelphia, as well as above, if they can procure boats for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I la&s;t night directed commodore Seymour to &s;tation all his gallies betweed Bordentown and Philadelphia, to give the ear|lie&s;t intelligence of any appearance of the enemy or the Jer&s;ey &s;hore.</P>
<P>I ye&s;terday rode up the river about eleven miles, to lord Sterling's po&s;t, where I found a pri&s;oner of the forty-&s;econd re|giment who had been ju&s;t brought in. He informed me that lord Cornwallis was at Pennytown with two battalions of gre|nadiers, and three of light infantry, all Briti&s;h, the He&s;&s;ian grenadiers, the forty-&s;econd Highland regiment, and two other battalions, the names of which he did not remember. He knew nothing of the rea&s;ons of their being a&s;&s;embled there, nor what were their future intentions. But I la&s;t night received informa|tion from lord Sterling, which had been brought in by his &s;couts, which in &s;ome mea&s;ure accounted for there being there. They had made a forced march from Trenton on &s;unday night, to Coryel's ferry, in hopes of &s;urpri&s;ing a &s;ufficient number of boats to tran&s;port them; but, finding them&s;elves di&s;appointed, had marched back to Pennytown, where they remained ye&s;ter|day.
<PB N="278" REF="031423_0277_0FEC5BABEEE0A028">
From their &s;everal attempts to &s;eize boats, it does not look as if they had brought any with them, as I was at one time informed. I la&s;t night &s;ent a per&s;on over to Trenton, to learn whether there was any appearance of building any: but he could not perceive any preparations for a work of that kind; &s;o that I am in hopes, if proper care is taken to keep all the craft out of their way, they will find the cro&s;&s;ing Delaware a matter of con&s;iderable difficulty.</P>
<P>I received another letter from general Lee la&s;t evening; it was dated at Chatham (which I take to be near Morri&s;town) the eighth of this month. He had then received my letter &s;ent by major Hoops, but &s;eemed &s;till inclined to hang upon the enemy's rear, to which I &s;hould have no objection, had I a &s;ufficient force to oppo&s;e them in front: but as I have not at pre&s;ent, nor do I &s;ee much probability of further reinforcement, I have wrote to him in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing terms, to join me with all expedition.</P>
<P>Major Shelden, who commands the volunteer hor&s;e from Connecticut, waits upon Congre&s;s to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;ome mode of pay. I can only &s;ay that the &s;ervice of him&s;elf and his troop has been &s;uch as merits the warme&s;t thanks of the public, and de&s;erves a hand&s;ome compen&s;ation for their trouble. Whate|ver is &s;ettled now, will &s;erve for a precedent in future.&mdash;From the experience I have had, this campaign, of the utility of hor&s;e, I am convinced there is no carrying on the war without them; and I would therefore recommend the e&s;tabli&s;hment of one or more corps (in proportion to the number of foot) in addition to tho&s;e already rai&s;ed in Virginia. If major Shelden would un|dertake the command of a regiment of hor&s;e on the continental e&s;tabli&s;hment, I believe he could very &s;oon rai&s;e them; and I can recommend him as a man of activity and &s;pirit, from what I have &s;een of him.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I LAST night received the favor of Mr. Thomp&s;on's letter inclo&s;ing the proceedings of Congre&s;s, of the eleventh in&s;tant.&mdash;As the publication of their re&s;olve, in my opinion, will not lead to any good end, but, on the contrary, may be at|tended with &s;ome bad con&s;equences, I &s;hall take the liberty to decline in&s;erting it in this day's orders. I am per&s;uaded, if the &s;ubject is taken up and recon&s;idered, that Congre&s;s will
<PB N="279" REF="031423_0278_0FEC5BAD9455B040">
concur with me in &s;entiment. I doubt not but there are &s;ome who have propagated the report: but what if they have?&mdash;Their remaining in or leaving Philadelphia mu&s;t be governed by circum&s;tances and events. If their departure &s;hould become nece&s;&s;ary, it will be right: on the other hand if there &s;hould not be a nece&s;&s;ity for it, they will remain, and their continu|ance will &s;hew the report to be the production of calumny and fal&s;ehood. In a word, &s;ir, I conceive it a matter that may be as well di&s;regarded; and that the removal or &s;taying of Congre&s;s, depending entirely upon events, &s;hould not have been the &s;ubject of a re&s;olve.</P>
<P>The intelligence we obtain re&s;pecting the movements and &s;i|tuation of the enemy is far from being &s;o certain and &s;atisfac|tory as I could wi&s;h, though every probable means in my pow|er, and that I can devi&s;e, are adopted for that purpo&s;e. The late&s;t I have received was from lord Sterling, la&s;t night. He &s;ays that two grenadiers of the Inni&s;killen regiments, who were taken and brought in by &s;ome countrymen, inform that gene|rals Howe, Cornwallis, Vaughan, &amp;c. with about &s;ix thou&s;and of the flying army, were at Pennytown, waiting for pontoons to come up, with which they mean to pa&s;s the river near the Blue Mountains, or at Coryel's ferry,&mdash;they believe the latter:&mdash;that the two battallions of guards were at Brun&s;wic, and the He&s;&s;ian gre|nadiers, cha&s;&s;eurs, and a regiment or two of the Briti&s;h troops, are at Trenton.</P>
<P>Captain Miller of colonel Hand's regiment al&s;o informs me, that a body of the enemy were marching to Burlington ye&s;ter|day morning. He had been &s;ent over with a &s;trong &s;couting party, and, at day-break, fell in with their advanced guards con&s;i&s;ting of about four hundred He&s;&s;ian troops, who fired upon him before they were di&s;covered, but without any lo&s;s, and ob|liged him to retreat with his party and to take boat. The number of the whole he could not a&s;certain: but it appeared to be con&s;iderable. Captain Miller's account is partly con|firmed by commodore Seymour, who reports that four or five hundred of the enemy had entered the town. Upon the whole, there can be no doubt but that Philadelphia is their object, and that they will pa&s;s the Delaware as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. Happy &s;hould I be if I could &s;ee the means of preventing them: at pre&s;ent, I confe&s;s, I do not. All military writers agree that it is a work of great difficulty, nay, impracticable, where there is any extent of coa&s;t to guard. This is the ca&s;e with us; and we have to do it with a force, &s;mall and incon&s;iderable, and much inferior to that of the enemy. Perhaps Congre&s;s have
<PB N="280" REF="031423_0279_0FEC5BAF2A9DBE88">
&s;ome hope and pro&s;pect of reinforcements: I have no intelligence of the &s;ort, and wi&s;h to be informed on the &s;ubject. Our little handful is daily decrea&s;ing by &s;ickne&s;s and other cau&s;es: and, without aid, without con&s;iderable &s;uccours and exertions on the part of the people, what can we rea&s;onably look for or expect, but an event that will be &s;everely felt by the com|mon cau&s;e, and that will wound the heart of every virtuous American,&mdash;the lo&s;s of Philadelphia? The &s;ubject is di&s;a|greeable, but yet it is true. I leave it, wi&s;hing that our &s;ituation may become &s;uch as to do away the apprehen&s;ions which at this time &s;eem to fill the minds of too many, and with too much ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>By a letter from general Heath, dated at Peek&s;kill, the eighth, I am advi&s;ed that lieutenant-colonel Vo&s;e was then there with Greaton's, Bond's, and Porter's regiments, amounting in the whole to between five and &s;ix hundred men, who were coming this way. He adds that generals Gates and Arnold would be at Go|&s;hen that night, with Stark's, Poor's, and Read's regiments; but for what purpo&s;e, he does not mention.</P>
<P>The inclo&s;ed extract of a letter which I received la&s;t night contains intelligence of an agreeable nature. I wi&s;h to hear its confirmation by the arrival of the &s;everal prizes: that with clo|thing and arms will be an invaluable acqui&s;ition.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be glad to be advi&s;ed of the mode I am to ob&s;erve in paying the officers; whether they are to be allowed to draw the pay lately e&s;tabli&s;hed, and from what time, or how long they are to be paid under the old e&s;tabli&s;hment. A pay-roll which was pre&s;ented ye&s;terday, being made up for the new, has given ri&s;e to the&s;e propo&s;itions. Upon my objecting to it, I was told that Congre&s;s or the board of war had e&s;tabli&s;hed the prece|dent, by paying the &s;ixth regiment of Virginia troops commanded by colonel Buckner, agreeable to the latter, as they came through Philadelphia.</P>

<P>THE apparent de&s;igns of the enemy being to avoid this ferry, and land their troops above and below us, have induced me to remove from this place the greater part of the troops, and throw them into a different di&s;po&s;ition on the river, where|by I hope not only to be more able to impede their pa&s;&s;age, but, al&s;o to avoid the danger of being inclo&s;ed in this angle of
<PB N="281" REF="031423_0280_0FEC5BB71B70D760">
the river. And notwith&s;tanding the extended appearances of the enemy on the other &s;ide, made, at lea&s;t in part, to divert our attention from any particular point as well as to harra&s;s us by fatigue, I cannot dive&s;t my&s;elf of the opinion that their principal de&s;ign is to ford the river &s;omewhere above Trenton; to which de&s;ign I have had particular re&s;pect in the new arrangement, wherein I am &s;o far happy as to have the concurrence of the gene|ral officers at this place.</P>
<P>Four brigades of the army, under generals lord Sterling, Mer|cer, Stephen and De Fermoy, extend from Yardley's up to Coryel's ferry, po&s;ted in &s;uch a manner as to guard every &s;u&s;picious part of the river, and to afford a&s;&s;i&s;tance to each other in ca&s;e of attack. General Ewing, with the flying camp of Penn&s;ylvania and a few Jer&s;ey troops under general Dickin&s;on, are po&s;ted from Yardley's ferry down to the ferry oppo&s;ite Bordentown. Colonel Cadwalladar, with the Penn&s;ylvania militia, occupies the ground above and below the mouth of Ne&s;haminy river as far down as Dunk's ferry, at which place colonel Nixon is po&s;ted with the third battalion of [<HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI>]. A proper quantity of artillery is appointed to each brigade; and I have ordered &s;mall redoubts to be thrown up oppo&s;ite every place where there is a po&s;&s;ibility of fording.&mdash;I &s;hall remove further up the river to be near the main body of my &s;mall army, with which every po&s;&s;ible oppo&s;ition &s;hall be given to any further approach of the enemy towards Philadel|phia.</P>
<P>As general Arm&s;trong has a good deal of influence in this &s;tate, and our pre&s;ent force is &s;mall and incon&s;iderable, I think he cannot be better employed than to repair to the counties where his intere&s;t lies, to animate the people, promote the re|cruiting &s;ervice, and encourage the militia to come in. He will al&s;o be able to form a proper judgment of the places &s;uit|able for magazines of provi&s;ion to be collected. I have reque&s;t|ed him to wait upon Congre&s;s on this &s;ubject; and if general Smallwood &s;hould go to Maryland on the &s;ame bu&s;ine&s;s, I think it will have a happy effect: he is popular and of great influence, and, I am per&s;uaded, would contribute greatly to that &s;tate's furni&s;hing her quota of men in a little time.

<P>IN a letter which I had the honor of addre&s;&s;ing you, I took the liberty to recommend that more battalions &s;hould be rai&s;ed for the new army than what had been voted. Having fully con&s;idered the matter, I am more and more convinced not only of the propriety but of the nece&s;&s;ity of the mea&s;ure. That the enemy will leave nothing une&s;&s;ayed in the cour&s;e of the next campaign to reduce the&s;e &s;tates to the rule of the mo&s;t * * *, mu&s;t be obvious to every one; and that the militia is not to be depended on, or aid expected from them but in ca&s;es of the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing emergency, is not to be doubted. The fir&s;t of the&s;e propo&s;itions is unque&s;tionable, and fatal experience has given her &s;anction to the truth of the latter: indeed their le|thargy of late, and backwardne&s;s to turn out at this alarming cri&s;is, &s;eem to ju&s;tify an apprehen&s;ion that nothing can bring them from their homes. For want of their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, a large part of Jer&s;ey has been expo&s;ed to ravage and to plunder; nor do I know that Penn&s;ylvania would &s;hare a better fate, could general

Howe effect a pa&s;&s;age acro&s;s the Delaware with a re&s;pectable force. The&s;e con&s;iderations have induced me to wi&s;h that no reliance, except &s;uch as may ari&s;e from nece&s;&s;ity, &s;hould ever be had in them again; and to make further mention to Congre&s;s of the expediency of increa&s;ing their army.&mdash;I tru&s;t the mea&s;ures will meet the earlie&s;t attention.</P>
<P>Had I lei&s;ure and were it nece&s;&s;ary, I could &s;ay much upon this head: but, as I have not, and the matter is well under&s;tood I will not add much. By augmenting the number of your battali|ons, you will augment your force: the officers of each will have their intere&s;t and influence; and, upon the whole, their numbers will be much greater, though they &s;hould not be com|plete. Added to this, from the pre&s;ent confu&s;ed &s;tate of Jer&s;ey, and the improper appointment of officers in many in&s;tances, I have little or no expectation that &s;he will be able to rai&s;e all the troops exacted from her, though I think it might be done, were &s;uitable &s;pirited gentlemen commi&s;&s;ioned, who would exert them&s;elves, and encourage the people, many of whom (for a failure in this in&s;tance, and who are well di&s;po&s;ed) are making their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions.&mdash;In a word, the next will be a trying campaign: and as all that is dear and valuable may depend upon the i&s;&s;ue of it, I would ad|vi&s;e that nothing &s;hould be omitted, that &s;hall &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary to our &s;ucce&s;s. Let us have a re&s;pectable army, and &s;uch as will be competent to every exigency.</P>
<P>I will al&s;o add that the critical &s;ituation of our affairs, and the di&s;&s;olution of our pre&s;ent force (now at hand), require that every nerve and exertion be employed for recruiting the new battalions. One part of general Howe's movements at this time, I believe, is with a de&s;ign to di&s;tract us and prevent this bu&s;ine&s;s. If the inclemency of the weather &s;hould force him into winter quarters, he will not remain there longer than ne|ce&s;&s;ity &s;hall oblige him: he will commence his operations in a &s;hort &s;pace of time: and in that time our levies mu&s;t be made up, to oppo&s;e him, or I fear the mo&s;t melancholy of all events mu&s;t take place.</P>
<P>The inclo&s;ed extract of a letter from the commi&s;&s;ary-general will &s;hew his demands for money, and his plans for procuring &s;alted provi&s;ions and a quantity of flour from the &s;outhward.

<P>The pay of our artilleri&s;ts bearing no proportion with that in the Engli&s;h or French &s;ervice,&mdash;the murmuring and di&s;atisfac|tion thereby occa&s;ioned, and the ab&s;olute impo&s;&s;ibility (as I am told) of getting them upon the old terms,&mdash;and the unavoidable nece&s;&s;ity of obtaining them at all events,&mdash;have induced me (al&s;o by advice) to promi&s;e officers and men that their pay &s;hould be augmented twenty-five per cent, or that their engage|ments &s;hould become null and void. This may appear to Con|gre&s;s premature and unwarrantable. But, &s;ir, if they view our &s;ituation in the light it &s;trikes their officers, they will be con|vinced of the utility of the mea&s;ure, and that the execution could not be delayed till after their meeting at Baltimore. In &s;hort, the pre&s;ent exigency of our affairs will not admit of de|lay either in council or the field: for well convinced I am, that if the enemy go into quarters at all, it will be for a &s;hort &s;ea&s;on. But I rather think the de&s;ign of general Howe is to po&s;&s;e&s;s him|&s;elf of Philadelphia this winter if po&s;&s;ible; and in truth I do not &s;ee what is to prevent him, as ten days more will put an end
<PB N="285" REF="031423_0284_0FEC5BC4046F5488">
to the exi&s;tence of our army. That one great point is to keep us as much harra&s;&s;ed as po&s;&s;ible, with a view to injure the recruit|ing &s;ervice and hinder a collection of &s;tores and other nece&s;|&s;aries for the next campaign, I am as clear in, as I am of my exi&s;tence. If therefore, [<HI>when</HI>] we have to provide this &s;hort interval, and make the&s;e great and ardent preparations,&mdash;every matter that in its nature is &s;elf-evident is to be referred to Congre&s;s at the di&s;tance of a hundred and thirty or forty miles, &s;o much time mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily elap&s;e, as to defeat the end in view.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid that this is an application for powers that are too dangerous to be entru&s;ted. I can only add that de&s;perate di&s;ea&s;es require de&s;perate remedies; and with truth declare that I have no lu&s;t after power, but wi&s;h with as much fervency as any man upon this wide-extended continent, for an oppor|tunity of turning the &s;word into a plough-&s;hare. But my feelings, as an officer and a man, have been &s;uch as to force me to &s;ay that no per&s;on ever had a greater choice of difficulties to con|tend with than I have.&mdash;It is needle&s;s to add, that &s;hort enli&s;t|ments, and a mi&s;taken dependence upon militia, have been the origin of all our misfortunes and the great accumulation of our debt.</P>
<P>We find, &s;ir, that the enemy are daily gathering &s;trength from the di&s;&s;affected. This &s;trength, like a &s;now-ball, by rolling, will increa&s;e, unle&s;s &s;ome means can be devi&s;ed to check effec|tually the progre&s;s of the enemy's arms. Militia may po&s;&s;ibly do it for a little while: but in a little while al&s;o, the militia of tho&s;e &s;tates which have been frequently called upon will not turn out at all; or, if they do, it will be with &s;o much reluct|ance and &s;loth, as to amount to the &s;ame thing:&mdash;in&s;tance, New|Jer&s;ey!&mdash;witne&s;s Penn&s;ylvania!&mdash;Could any thing but the river Delaware have &s;aved Philadelphia?&mdash;Can any thing (the exige<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> of the ca&s;e indeed may ju&s;tify it) be more de&s;tructive to the recr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">|ing &s;ervice, than giving ten dollars bounty for &s;ix weeks' &s;ervice of the militia, who come in, you cannot tell how,&mdash;go, you can not tell when,&mdash;and act, you cannot tell where&mdash;con&s;ume you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> provi&s;ions, exhau&s;t your &s;tores, and leave you at la&s;t at a criti|cal moment?</P>
<P>The&s;e, &s;ir, are the men I am to depend upon, ten days hence: this is the ba&s;is on which your cau&s;e will and mu&s;t forever de|pend, till you get a large &s;tanding army &s;ufficient of it&s;elf to op|po&s;e the enemy. I therefore beg leave to give it as my hum|ble opinion, that eighty-eight battalions are by no means equal to the oppo&s;ition you can make, and that a moment's time is not
<PB N="286" REF="031423_0285_0FEC5BC7A102DDE0">
to be lo&s;t in rai&s;ing a greater number,&mdash;not le&s;s in my opinion and the opinion of my officers, than a hundred and ten. It may be urged that it will be found difficult enough to complete the fir&s;t number. This may be true, and yet the officers of a hun|dred and ten battalions will recruit a great many more men, than tho&s;e of eighty-eight. In my judgment this is not a time to &s;tand upon expence: our funds are the only object of con&s;i|deration. The &s;tate of New-York have added one battalion (I wi&s;h they had made it two) to their quota.&mdash;If any good offi|cers offer to rai&s;e men upon continental pay and e&s;tabli&s;hment in this quarter, I &s;hall encourage them to do &s;o, and regiment them when they have done it. If Congre&s;s di&s;approve of this proceeding, they will plea&s;e to &s;ignify it, as I mean it for the be&s;t.</P>
<P>It may be thought that I am going a good deal out of the line of my duty, to adopt the&s;e mea&s;ures, or to advi&s;e thus free|ly. A character to lo&s;e,&mdash;an e&s;tate to forfeit,&mdash;the ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ings of liberty at &s;take,&mdash;and a life devoted,&mdash;mu&s;t be my ex|cu&s;e.</P>
<P>I have heard nothing of the light-hor&s;e from Virginia, nor the regiment from the Ea&s;tern-Shore. I wi&s;h to know what troops are to act in the different departments, and to have tho&s;e from the &s;outhward (de&s;igned for this place) ordered on as fa&s;t as they &s;hall be rai&s;ed. The route &s;hould be pointed out by which they are to march; a&s;&s;i&s;tant-commi&s;&s;aries and quarter|ma&s;ters upon the communication, to &s;upply their wants: the fir&s;t or &s;econd officer of each battalion to forward them, and the other to come on, receive and form them at their place of de&s;tination. Unle&s;s this is immediately &s;et about, the campaign, if it &s;hould be clo&s;ed, will be opened in the &s;pring before we have any men in the field.</P>
<P>Every exertion &s;hould be u&s;ed to procure tents: a clothier-general &s;hould be appointed without lo&s;s of time, for &s;upplying the army with every article in that way:&mdash;he &s;hould be a man of bu&s;ine&s;s and abilities. A commi&s;&s;ary of pri&s;oners mu&s;t be appointed to attend the army:&mdash;for want of an officer of this kind, the exchange of pri&s;oners has been conducted in a &s;hame|ful and injurious manner. We have had them from all quarters pu&s;hed into our camps at the mo&s;t critical junctures, and with|out the lea&s;t previous notice. We have had them travelling through the different &s;tates in all directions by certificates from committees, without any kind of controul; and have had in&s;tan|ces of &s;ome going into the enemy's camp without my privity or knowledge, after pa&s;&s;ing in the manner before mentioned.&mdash;
<PB N="287" REF="031423_0286_0FEC5BCA117F5EC0">
There may be other officers nece&s;&s;ary which I do not recollect at this time, and which, when thought of, mu&s;t be provided: for this, &s;ir, you may rely on, that the commanding officer, under the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment, is obliged to attend to the bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;o ma|ny different departments, as to render it impo&s;&s;ible to conduct that of his own with the attention nece&s;&s;ary;&mdash;than which, nothing can be more injurious.</P>
<P>In a former letter, I intimated my opinion of the nece&s;&s;ity of having a brigadier for every three regiments, and a major gene|ral to every three brigades, at mo&s;t. I think no time is to be lo&s;t in making the appointments, that the arrangements may be con&s;equent. This will not aid the recruiting &s;ervice, but will be the readie&s;t means of forming and di&s;ciplining the army afterwards, which, in the &s;hort time we have to do it, is of amazing con&s;equence. I have labored ever &s;ince I have been in the &s;ervice, to di&s;courage all kinds of local attachments and di&s;|tinctions of country, denominating the whole by the greater name of '<HI>American:</HI>' but I found it impo&s;&s;ible to overcome prejudices: and, under the new e&s;tabli&s;hment, I conceive it be&s;t to &s;tir up an emulation; in order to do which, would it not be bet|ter for each &s;tate to furni&s;h (though not to appoint) their own brig|adiers?&mdash;This, if known to be part of the e&s;tabli&s;hment, might prevent a good deal of contention and jealou&s;y; and would, I be|lieve, be the means of promotions going forward with more &s;atis|faction, and quiet the higher officers.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t I am &s;peaking of promotions, I cannot help giving it as my opinion, that, if Congre&s;s think proper to confirm what I have done with re&s;pect to the corps of artillery, colonel Knox (at pre&s;ent at the head of that department, but who, without promotion, will re&s;ign) ought to be appointed to the command of it, with the rank and pay of brigadier. I have al&s;o to mention, that, for want of &s;ome e&s;tabli&s;hment in the department of engi|neers agreeable to the plan laid before Congre&s;s in October la&s;t, colonel Putnam, who was at the head of it, has quitted, and taken a regiment in the &s;tate of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. I know of no other man tolerable well qualified for the conducting of that bu&s;ine&s;s. None of the French gentlemen whom I have &s;een with appoint|ments in that way appear to me to know any thing of the matter. There is one in Philadelphia, who I am told, is clever: but him I have never &s;een.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t al&s;o once more beg leave to mention to Congre&s;s the expediency of letting promotions be in a regimental line. The want of this has already driven &s;ome of the be&s;t officers that were in your army, out of the &s;ervice. From repeated and
<PB N="288" REF="031423_0287_0FEC5BCC419067E8">
&s;trict enquiry I am convinced you can adopt no mode of promotion that will be better received, or that will give more general &s;atisfac|tion. I wi&s;h therefore to have it announced.</P>
<P>The ca&s;ting of cannon is a matter that ought not to be one mo|ment delayed: and therefore I &s;hall &s;end colonel Knox to put this in a train, as al&s;o to have travelling carriages and &s;hot provided,&mdash;elaboratories to be e&s;tabli&s;hed, one in Hart|ford, and another in York. Magazines of provi&s;ions &s;hould al|&s;o be laid in. The&s;e I &s;hall fix with the commi&s;&s;ary. As our great lo&s;s la&s;t year proceeded from a want of teams, I &s;hall di|rect the quarter-ma&s;ter-general to furni&s;h a certain number to each regiment to an&s;wer the common purpo&s;es thereof, that the ar|my may be enabled to remove from place to place differently from what we have done, or could do, this campaign. Ammu|nition carts, and proper carts for entrenching tools, &s;hould al&s;o be provided, and I &s;hall direct about them accordingly. Above all a &s;tore of &s;mall arms &s;hould be provided, or men will be of little u&s;e. The con&s;umption and wa&s;te of the&s;e, this year, has been great:&mdash;militia, flying-camp men, &amp;c. coming in without, were obliged to be furni&s;hed, or become u&s;ele&s;s. Ma|ny of the&s;e threw their arms away: &s;ome lo&s;t them, whil&s;t others de&s;erted, and took them away. In a word, although I u&s;ed every precaution to pre&s;erve them, the lo&s;s has been great; and this will forever be the ca&s;e in &s;uch a mixed and irregular army as ours has been.</P>
<P>If no part of the troops already embarked at New-York has appeared in Virginia, their de&s;tination doubtle&s;s mu&s;t be to &s;ome other quarter; and that &s;tate mu&s;t, I &s;hould think be freed from any inva&s;ion, if general Howe can be effectually oppo&s;ed in this. I therefore inclo&s;e a memorandum given me by brigadier Stephen of Virginia, which Congre&s;s will plea&s;e to adopt in the whole,&mdash;in part,&mdash;or reject,&mdash;as may be con&s;i&s;tent with their plans and intelligence.</P>
<P>The divi&s;ion of the army, late under the command of general Lee, now general Sullivan, is ju&s;t upon the point of joining us. A &s;trange kind of fatality has attended it. They had orders on the &s;eventeenth of November to join, now more than a month. General Gates, with four ea&s;tern regiments, is al&s;o near at hand: three others from tho&s;e &s;tates were coming on, by his order, by the way of Peek&s;kill, and had joined general Heath whom I had ordered on with Par&s;on's brigade, to join me, leaving Clinton's brigade and &s;ome militia (that were at Forts Montgomery and Con&s;titution) to guard tho&s;e important pa&s;&s;es of the Highlands. But the convention of the &s;tate of
<PB N="289" REF="031423_0288_0FEC5BD3F60DC0D8">
New-York &s;eeming to be much alarmed at Heath's coming a|way,&mdash;a fleet appearing off New-London,&mdash;and &s;ome part of the enemy's troops retiring towards Brun&s;wic,&mdash;induced me to countermand the order for the march of Par&s;ons's brigade, and to direct the three regiments from Tyconderoga to halt at Mor|ri&s;town in Jer&s;ey (where I under&s;tand about eight hundred militia had collected), in order to in&s;pirit the inhabitants, and, as far as po&s;&s;ible, cover that part of the country. I &s;hall &s;end general Maxwell this day to take the command of them, and, if to be done, to harra&s;s and annoy the enemy in their quarters, and cut off their convoys.</P>
<P>The care and vigilance, which were u&s;ed in &s;ecuring the boats on this river, have hitherto baffled every attempt of the enemy to cro&s;s: but, from concurring reports and appearances, they are waiting for ice to afford them a pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>Since writing the foregoing, I have received a letter from gov|ernor Cooke of Rhode-I&s;land, of which the inclo&s;ed is a copy. Previous to this, and immediately upon the fir&s;t intelligence ob|tained of a fleet's going through the Sound, I di&s;patched orders to generals Spencer and Arnold to proceed without the lea&s;t delay to the ea&s;tward. The fir&s;t, I pre&s;ume, is gone: the latter, not get|ting my letter till he came to a place called Ea&s;ton, was, by advice of general Gates, who al&s;o met my letter at the &s;ame place, in|duced to come on hither before he proceeded to the ea&s;tward.&mdash;Mo&s;t of our brigadiers are laid up: not one has come on with the divi&s;ion under general Sullivan, but they are left &s;ick at different places on the road.</P>
<P>By accounts from the ea&s;tward, a large body of men had a&s;&s;em|bled in Rhode-I&s;land, from the &s;tates of Ma&s;&s;acu&s;etts and Connecticut. I pre&s;ume (but I have no advice of it) that the mi|litia ordered from the fir&s;t, to rendezvous at Danbury (&s;ix thou&s;and in number) under the command of major-general Lincoln, for &s;upplying the place of the di&s;banded men of that &s;tate in the continental army, will now be ordered to Rhode-I&s;land.</P>
<P>In &s;peaking of general Lincoln, I &s;hould not do him ju&s;tice, were I not to add that he is a gentleman well worthy of notice in the military line. He commanded the militia from Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts la&s;t &s;ummer, or fall rather, and much to my &s;atisfac|tion,&mdash;having proved him&s;elf on all occa&s;ions an active, &s;pirited, &s;en&s;ible man. I do not know whether it his wi&s;h to re|main in the military line, or whether, if he &s;hould, any thing under the rank he now holds in the &s;tate he comes from would &s;atisfy him. How far an appointment of this kind might offend
<PB N="290" REF="031423_0289_0FEC5BD585CDD700">
the continental brigadiers, I cannot undertake to &s;ay:&mdash;many there are, over whom he ought not to be placed; but I know of no way to di&s;criminate.&mdash;Brigadier Reed of New-Ham&s;hire does not, I pre&s;ume, mean to continue in &s;ervice: he ought not,&mdash;as I am told, by the &s;everity of the &s;mall-pox, he is become both blind and deaf.</P>

<P>P. S. Generals Gates and Sullivan have this in&s;tant come in. By them I learn that few or no men are recruited out of the regi|ments coming on with them, and that there is very little rea&s;on to expect that the&s;e regiments will be prevailed upon to continue after their term of &s;ervice expires. If militia then do not come in, the con&s;equences are but too evident.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT I &s;hould dwell upon the &s;ubject of our di&s;tre&s;&s;es, can|not be more di&s;agreeable to Congre&s;s than it is painful to my&s;elf. The alarming &s;ituation to which our affairs are reduced, impels me to the mea&s;ure. Inquiry and inve&s;tigation,&mdash;which in mo&s;t ca&s;es &s;erve to develope and point out a remedy,&mdash;in ours, pre&s;ent more and greater difficulties. Till of late I was led to hope from report that no incon&s;iderable part of the troops compo&s;ing the regiments that were with general Lee, and tho&s;e from Tyconderogo under general Gates, had en|li&s;ted again. This intelligence, I confe&s;s, gave me rea&s;on to expect that I &s;hould have at the expiration of the pre&s;ent year, a force &s;omewhat more re&s;pectable than what I find will be the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Having examined into the &s;tate of tho&s;e regiments, I am au|thori&s;ed to &s;ay, from the information of their officers, that but ve|ry few of the men have enli&s;ted. Tho&s;e who have, are of the troops from Tyconderoga, and were permitted to vi&s;it their friends and homes, as part of the terms on which they would re|engage. In re&s;pect to tho&s;e who marched with general Lee, I cannot learn that any have. Their refu&s;al, I am told, has not proceeded more from an aver&s;ion to the &s;ervice, or any fixed determination not to engage again, than from their wi&s;hes to return home,&mdash;the non-appointment of officers in &s;ome in|&s;tances,&mdash;the turning out of good, and appointing of bad,&mdash;in others, and the incomplete or rather no arrangement of them,&mdash;a work unhappily committed to the management of their &s;tates: nor have I the mo&s;t di&s;tant pro&s;pect of retaining them
<PB N="291" REF="031423_0290_0FEC5BD712F95878">
a moment longer than the la&s;t of this in&s;tant, notwith&s;tanding the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing &s;olicitations and the obvious nece&s;&s;ity for it.</P>
<P>By the departure of the&s;e regiments I &s;hall be left with five from Virginia, Smallwood's from Maryland, a &s;mall part of Rawlin's, Hand's from Penn&s;ylvania, a part of Ward's from Con|necticut, and the German battalion, amounting in the whole at this time from fourteen to fifteen hundred effective men. This handful, and &s;uch militia as may chu&s;e to join me, will then com|po&s;e our army.</P>
<P>When I reflect upon the&s;e things they fill me with much concern, knowing that general Howe has a number of troops can|toned in the towns bordering on and near the Delaware,&mdash;his intentions to pa&s;s, as &s;oon as the ice is &s;ufficiently formed, to invade Penn&s;ylvania and to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of Philadelphia, if po&s;|&s;ible. To guard again&s;t his de&s;igns and the execution of them, &s;hall employ my every exertion: but how is this to be done? As yet but few militia have gone to Philadelphia, and they are to be our &s;upport at this alarming cri&s;is. Had I enter|tained a doubt of general Howe's intentions to pa&s;s the Delaware on the di&s;&s;olution of our army, and as &s;oon as the ice is made, it would now be done away. An intercepted letter from a gentleman of Philadelphia, (who has joined the enemy), to his friend and partner in the city, declares that to be their de&s;ign,&mdash;that the army would be there in ten or twenty days from the &s;ix|teenth in&s;tant, the time of his writing, if the ice &s;hould be made;&mdash;advi&s;es him by no means to remove their &s;tores,&mdash;that they would be &s;afe.</P>
<P>The ob&s;tacles which have ari&s;en to the rai&s;ing of the new army, from the mode of appointing the officers, induce me to hope, if Congre&s;s re&s;olve on an additional number of battalions to tho&s;e already voted, that they will devi&s;e &s;ome other rule by which the officers, e&s;pecially the field-officers, &s;hould be ap|pointed. In ca&s;e an augmentation &s;hould be made to the ea&s;tern regiments, a deviation from the former mode will operate more &s;trongly as to them than to other battalions, becau&s;e there have been many more officers in &s;ervice from tho&s;e &s;tates, than the regiments voted to be rai&s;ed would admit of; by which means &s;everal de&s;erving men could not have been provided for, had the utmo&s;t pains been u&s;ed for the purpo&s;e; and many others of merit have been neglected in the late appointments, and tho&s;e of little worth and le&s;s experience put in their places or promoted over their heads. This has been the ca&s;e with many of the be&s;t officers.</P>
<P>The inclo&s;ed letter from the payma&s;ter-general will &s;hew
<PB N="292" REF="031423_0291_0FEC5BD9133D1838">

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE your obliging favors of the twenty-fir&s;t and twen|ty-third. The blankets are come to hand; but I would not have any of the other goods &s;ent on till you hear again from me.</P>
<P>I agree with you that it is vain to ruminate upon, or even re|flect upon the authors or cau&s;es of, our pre&s;ent misfortunes: we &s;hould rather exert our&s;elves, and look forward with hopes that &s;ome lucky chance may yet turn up in our favor. Bad as our pro&s;pects are, I &s;hould not have the lea&s;t doubt of &s;ucce&s;s in the end, did not the late treachery and defection of tho&s;e, who &s;tood foremo&s;t in the oppo&s;ition while fortune &s;miled up|on us, make me fearful that many more will follow their example, who, by u&s;ing their influence with &s;ome and working upon the fears of others, may extend the circle &s;o as to take in whole towns, counties, nay, provinces. Of this we have a recent in&s;tance in Jer&s;ey; and I wi&s;h many parts in Penn&s;ylvania may not be rea|dy to receive the yoke.</P>
<P>The &s;ecurity of the continental &s;hips of war in Delaware is cer|tainly a capital object; and yet to draught the many hands, nece&s;&s;ary to fit them out, from the militia, might be dangerous ju&s;t now: perhaps in a little time hence their places may be &s;upplied with country militia; and then, if the exigency of af|fairs requires it, they certainly ought to be &s;pared.&mdash;I will ju&s;t hint to you a propo&s;ition that was made, or rather talked of, a few days ago by the officers of two New-England regiments who&s;e time of &s;ervice will expire on the fir&s;t of January. They
<PB N="293" REF="031423_0292_0FEC47943144D2D0">

<P>Lieutenant Roger of the navy is already gone in, and I have made a demand of lieutenant Jo&s;iah in exchange; but I have not heard whether Lord Howe accedes to it.

<P>From an intercepted letter from a per&s;on in the &s;ecrets of the enemy, I find their intentions are to cro&s;s Delaware as &s;oon as the ice is &s;ufficiently &s;trong.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the plea&s;ure of congratulating you upon the &s;uc|ce&s;s of an enterpri&s;e which I had formed again&s;t a detachment of the enemy lying in Trenton, and which was executed ye&s;terday morning.</P>
<P>The evening of the twenty-fifth I ordered the troops intended for this purpo&s;e to parade back of M'Konkey's ferry, that they might begin to pa&s;s as &s;oon as it grew dark, imagining that we &s;hould be able to throw them all over, with the nece&s;&s;ary artillery, by twelve o'clock, and that we might ea&s;ily arrive at Trenton by five in the morning, the di&s;tance being about nine miles. But the quantity of ice, made that night, impeded the pa&s;&s;age of the
<PB N="294" REF="031423_0293_0FEC5BE09BFE0018">
boats <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o much, that it was three o'clock before the artillery could be all got over; and near four, before the troops took up their line of march.</P>
<P>This made me de&s;pair of &s;urpri&s;ing the town, as I well knew we could not reach it before the day was fairly broke. But as I was certain there was no making a retreat without being di&s;|covered, and harra&s;&s;ed on repa&s;&s;ing the river, I determined to pu&s;h on at all events. I formed my detachment in two divi&s;i|ons, one to march by the lower or river road, the other by the upper or Pennington road. As the divi&s;ions had nearly the &s;ame di&s;tance to march, I ordered each of them, immediately upon forcing the out guards, to pu&s;h directly into the town, that they might charge the enemy before they had time to form.</P>
<P>The upper divi&s;ion arrived at the enemy's advanced po&s;t exact|ly at eight o'clock; and in three minutes after, I found, from the fire on the lower road, that that divi&s;ion had al&s;o got up. The out guards made but &s;mall oppo&s;ition, though for their numbers, they behaved very well, keeping up a con&s;tant retreat|ing fire from behind hou&s;es. We pre&s;ently &s;aw their main body formed; but from their motions, they &s;eemed undetermined how to act.</P>
<P>Being hard pre&s;&s;ed by our troops who had already got po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of their artillery, they attempted to file off by a road on their right, leading to Princeton. But perceiving their inten|tion, I threw a body of troops in their way; which immediate|ly checked them. Finding from our di&s;po&s;ition, that they were &s;urrounded, and that they mu&s;t inevitably be cut to pieces if they made any further re&s;i&s;tance, they agreed to lay down their arms. The number that &s;ubmitted in this manner was twenty|three officers and eight hundred and eighty-&s;ix men. Colonel Rahl the commanding officer, and &s;even others, were found wound|ed in the town. I do not exactly know how many they had kil|led; but I faney, not above twenty or thirty, as they never made any regular &s;tand. Our lo&s;s is very trifling indeed&mdash;only two officers and one or two privates wounded.</P>
<P>I find that the detachment of the enemy con&s;i&s;ted of the three He&s;&s;ian regiments of Lan&s;pach, Kniphau&s;en, and Rhal, amount|ing to about fifteen hundred men, and a troop of Briti&s;h light|hor&s;e: but, immediately upon the beginning of the attack, all tho&s;e who were not killed or taken, pu&s;hed directly down the road towards Bordentown. The&s;e would likewi&s;e have fallen into our hands, could my plan have been completely carried in|to execution. General Ewing was to have cro&s;&s;ed before day
<PB N="295" REF="031423_0294_0FEC5BE74E605028">
at Trenton ferry, and taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the bridge leading out of town: but the quantity of ice was &s;o great, that, though he did every thing in his power to effect it, he could not get over. This difficulty al&s;o hindered general Cadwallader from cro&s;&s;ing with the Penn&s;ylvania militia from Bri&s;tol. He got part of his foot over: but finding it impo&s;&s;ible to embark his artillery, he was obliged to de&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>I am fully confident, that, could the troops under generals Ew|ing and Cadwallader have pa&s;&s;ed the river, I &s;hould have been able with their a&s;&s;i&s;tance to have driven the enemy from all their po&s;ts below Trenton. But the numbers I had with me being inferior to theirs below me, and a &s;trong battalion of light infantry being at Princeton above me, I thought it mo&s;t pru|dent to return the &s;ame evening with the pri&s;oners and the artille|ry we had taken. We found no &s;tores of any con&s;equence in the town.</P>
<P>In ju&s;tice to the officers and men, I mu&s;t add that their beha|vior upon this occa&s;ion, reflects the highe&s;t honor upon them. The difficulty in pa&s;&s;ing the river in a very &s;evere night, and their march through a violent &s;torm of &s;now and hail, did not in the lea&s;t abate their ardor: but when they came to the charge, each &s;eemed to vie with the other in pre&s;&s;ing forward: and were I to give a preference to any particular corps, I &s;hould do great inju&s;|tice to the others.</P>
<P>Colonel Baylor, my fir&s;t aid-de-camp, will have the honor of delivering this to you; and from him you may be made acquainted with many other particulars. His &s;pirited behavior up|on every occa&s;ion requires me to recommend him to your particular notice.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM ju&s;t &s;etting out to attempt a &s;econd pa&s;&s;age over the Delaware with the troops that were with me on the morning of the twenty-&s;ixth. I am determined to effect it if po&s;&s;i|ble; but know that it will be attended with much fatigue and dif|ficulty on account of the ice, which will neither allow us to cro&s;s on foot, nor give us an ea&s;y pa&s;&s;age with boats. General Cadwallader cro&s;&s;ed from Bri&s;tol on the twenty-&s;eventh, and, by his letter of ye&s;terday, was at Bordentown with about eigh|teen
<PB N="296" REF="031423_0295_0FEC5BE8D71BD908">
hundred men. In addition to the&s;e, general Mifflin &s;ent over five hundred from Philadelphia on friday, three hundred ye&s;terday evening from Burlington, and will follow to-day with &s;even or eight hundred more. I have taken every precaution in my power for &s;ub&s;i&s;ting the troops, and &s;hall, without lo&s;s of time, and as &s;oon as circum&s;tances will admit of it, pur&s;ue the enemy in their retreat,&mdash;try to beat up more of their quarters, and, in a word, in every in&s;tance, adopt &s;uch mea&s;ures as the exigency of our affairs requires, and our &s;ituation will ju&s;tify.</P>
<P>Had it not been for the unhappy failure of generals Ewing and Cadwallader in their attempts to pa&s;s on the night of the twenty-fifth,&mdash;and if the &s;everal concerted attacks could have been made,&mdash;I have no doubt but that our views would have &s;ucceeded to our warme&s;t expectations. What was done occa&s;i|oned the enemy to leave their &s;everal po&s;ts on the Delaware with great precipitation. The peculiar di&s;tre&s;&s;es to which the troops who were with me were reduced by the &s;everities of cold, rain, &s;now, and &s;torm,&mdash;the charge of the pri&s;oners they had taken,&mdash;and another rea&s;on that might me mentioned,&mdash;and the little pro&s;pect of receiving &s;uccours on account of the &s;ea&s;on and &s;itu|ation of the river,&mdash;would not authori&s;e a further pur&s;uit at that time.</P>
<P>Since tran&s;mitting the li&s;t of pri&s;oners, a few more have been di&s;covered and taken in Trenton,&mdash;among them a lieutenant-colo|nel, and a deputy-adjutant-general,&mdash;the whole amounting to a|bout a thou&s;and.</P>
<P>I have been honored with your letter of the twenty-third and its &s;everal inclo&s;ures, to which I &s;hall pay due attention.&mdash;A flag goes in this morning with a letter to general Howe, and another to general Lee. For the latter, Robert Morris, e&s;|quire has tran&s;mitted a bill of exchange, drawn by two Briti&s;h officers, for a hundred and &s;ixteen pounds, nine &s;hillings, and three pence, on major Small, for money furni&s;hed them in South-Carolina, which I tru&s;t will be paid.

<P>YOUR re&s;olves of the twenty-&s;eventh ultimo were tran&s;mit|ted me la&s;t night by me&s;&s;ieurs Clymer, Morris, and Walton. The confidence which Congre&s;s have honored me with by the&s;e proceedings, has a claim to my warme&s;t acknowledgments.

If <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y exertions &s;hould not be attended with the de&s;ired &s;ucce&s;s, I tru&s;t the failure will be imputed on the true cau&s;e,&mdash;the peculi|arly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> and the difficulties I have to combat,&mdash;rather than to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> of zeal for my country, and the clo&s;e&s;t attention to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words">, to promote which has ever been my &s;tudy.</P>
<P>On monday morning I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the Delaware my&s;elf; the whole of our troops and artillery, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> till ye&s;terday, owing to the ice which rendered their pa&s;&s;age extremely difficult and fatiguing. Since their arrival, we have been parading the regiments who&s;e time of &s;ervice is now expired, in order to know what force we &s;hould have to depend on, and how to regulate our views ac|cordingly. After much per&s;ua&s;ion and the exertions of their officers, half or a greater proportion of tho&s;e from the ea&s;tward have con&s;ented to &s;tay &s;ix weeks on a bounty of ten dollars. I feel the inconvenience of this advance, and I know the con&s;e|quences which will re&s;ult from it:&mdash;but what could be done?&mdash;
<PB N="2" REF="031423_0298_0FEC5C36919BA508">
Penn&s;ylvania had allowed the &s;ame to her militia:&mdash;the troops felt their importance, and would have their price. Indeed, as their aid is &s;o e&s;&s;ential, and not to be di&s;pen&s;ed with, it is to be wondered they had not e&s;timated it at a higher rate. I per|ceive that Congre&s;s, apprehen&s;ive of this event, had made un|limitted provi&s;ion for it.</P>
<P>General Mifflin is at Bordentown with about eighteen hun|dred men, and general Cadwallader at Cro&s;wix's, with about the &s;ame number.&mdash;We are now making our arrangements, and concerting a plan of operations, which I &s;hall attempt to exe|cute as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and which I hope will be attended with &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>As to the number and &s;ituation of the enemy, I cannot ob|tain certain intelligence: but, from the accounts mo&s;t to be re|lied on, they have collected the principal part of their force, from Brun&s;wic and the neighboring po&s;ts, at Princeton, where they are throwing up &s;ome works. The number there is re|ported to be from five to &s;ix thou&s;and; and it is confidently &s;aid they have &s;ent the chief part of their baggage to Brun&s;wic. It is added, that general Howe landed at Amboy a day or two ago with a thou&s;and light troops, and is on his march from thence.</P>
<P>I have &s;ent into different parts of Jer&s;ey, men of influence to &s;pirit up the militia, and flatter my&s;elf that the many injuries they have received will induce &s;ome to give their aid. If what they have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> not rou&s;e their re&s;entment, they mu&s;t not po&s;&s;e&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> of humanity.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the honor to inform you, that, &s;ince the date of my la&s;t from Trenton, I have removed with the army under my
<PB N="3" REF="031423_0299_0FEC5C3847BE5490">
command to this place. The difficulty of cro&s;&s;ing the Dela|ware on account of the ice made our pa&s;&s;age over it tedious, and gave the enemy an opportunity of drawing in their &s;everal cantonments and a&s;&s;embling their whole force at Princeton. Their large picquets, advanced towards Trenton,&mdash;their great preparations, and &s;ome intelligence I had received,&mdash;added to their knowledge that the fir&s;t of January brought on a di&s;&s;olu|tion of the be&s;t part of our army,&mdash;gave me the &s;tronge&s;t rea|&s;ons to conclude that an attack upon us was meditating.</P>
<P>Our &s;ituation was mo&s;t critical, and our force &s;mall. To re|move immediately was again de&s;troying every dawn of hope which had begun to revive in the brea&s;ts of the Jer&s;ey militia; and to bring tho&s;e troops which had fir&s;t cro&s;&s;ed the Delaware and were lying at Cro&s;wix's under general Cadwallader, and tho&s;e under general Mifflin at Bordentown (amounting in the whole to about three thou&s;and &s;ix-hundred), to Trenton, was to bring them to an expo&s;ed place. One or the other however was unavoidable:&mdash;the latter was preferred, and they were or|dered to join us at Trenton, which they did, by a night-march, on the fir&s;t in&s;tant.</P>
<P>On the &s;econd, according to my expectation, the enemy be|gan to advance upon us; aud, after &s;ome &s;kirmi&s;hing, the head of their column reached Trenton about four o'clock, whil&s;t their rear was as far back as Maidenhead. They attempted to pa&s;s Sanpink creek which runs through Trenton, at different places; but, finding the fords guard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and kindled their fires.&mdash;We were drawn up on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> creek.&mdash;In this &s;ituation we remained till dark, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the enemy, and receiving the fire of their field <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> which did us but little damage.</P>
<P>Having by this time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that the enemy were greatly &s;uperior in number, and that their de&s;ign was to &s;urround us, I ordered all our bagg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e to be removed &s;ilently to Burlington &s;oon after dark; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> o'clock, after renewing our fires and leaving guards at the bridge in Trenton, and other pa&s;&s;es on the &s;ame &s;tream above, marched by a round-about road to Princeton where I knew they could not have much force left, and might have &s;tores. One thing I was certain of,&mdash;that it would avoid the appearance of a retreat (which was of cour&s;e,&mdash;or to run the hazard of the whole army being cut off)&mdash;whil&s;t we might by a fortunate &s;troke withdraw general Howe from Trenton, and give &s;ome reputation to our arms.&mdash;Happily we &s;ucceeded.&mdash;We found Princeton about &s;un-ri&s;e with only three
<PB N="4" REF="031423_0300_0FEC5BF44A427AE8">
regiments and three troops of light-hor&s;e in it, two of which were on their march to Trenton. The&s;e three regiments, e&s;pe|cially the two fir&s;t&punc; made a galiant re&s;i&s;tance, and, in killed, wounded, and pri&s;oners, mu&s;t have lo&s;t five hundred men: up|wards of one hundred of them were left dead in the field; and, with what I have with me, and what were taken in the pur&s;uit and carried acro&s;s the Delaware, there are near three hundred pri&s;oners, fourteen of whom are officers, all Briti&s;h.</P>
<P>This piece of good fortune is counterbalanced by the lo&s;s of the brave and worthy general Mercer, colonels Hazlet and Potter, captain Neal of the artillery, captain Fleming who commanded the fir&s;t Virginia regiment, and four or five other valuable officers, who, with about twenty-five or thirty privates were &s;lain in the field. Our whole lo&s;s cannot be a&s;certained, as many who are in the pur&s;uit of the enemy (who were cha&s;ed three or four miles) are not yet come in.</P>
<P>The rear of the enemy's army lying at Maidenhead (not more than five or &s;ix miles from Princeton) was up with us be|fore our pur&s;uit was over: but as I had the precaution to de&s;troy the bridge over Stoney-brook (about half a mile from the field of action), they were &s;o long retarded there as to give us time to move off in good order for this place. We took two bra&s;s field pieces; but for want of hor&s;es could not bring them away. We al&s;o took &s;ome blankets, &s;hoes, and a few other trif|fling articles, burned the hay, and de&s;troyed &s;uch other things as the &s;hortne&s;s of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> would admit of.</P>
<P>My original <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> out from Trenton, was, to have pu&s;hed on to Brun&s;wic: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the harra&s;&s;ed &s;tate of our troops (many of them having had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> for two nights and a day), and the danger of lo&s;ing the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> we had gained by aiming at too much, induced me by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of my officers, to relin|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ui&s;h the attempts: but, in my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> &s;ix or eight hundred fre&s;h troops upon a forced march would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> de&s;troyed all their &s;tores and magazines,&mdash;taken (as we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ince learned) their military che&s;t, containing &s;eventy thou&s;and pounds,&mdash;and put an end to the war. The enemy from the be&s;t intelligence I have been able to get, were &s;o much alarmed at the apprehen&s;i|on of this, that they marched immediately to Brun&s;wic without halting, except at the bridges (for I al&s;o took up tho&s;e on Mill|&s;tone, on the different routs to Brun&s;wic), and got there before day.</P>
<P>From the be&s;t information I have received, general Howe has left no men either at Trenton or Princeton. The truth of this I am endeavoring to a&s;certain, that I may regulate my movements accordingly.</P>

<P>I AM happy to inform you that the account of general Mercer's death, tran&s;mitted in my la&s;t, was premature, though it was mentioned as certain by many who &s;aw him after he was wounded.

Penn&s;ylvania had allowed the &s;ame to her militia:&mdash;the troops felt their importance, and would have their price.

<P>As to the number and &s;ituation of the enemy, I cannot ob|tain certain intelligence: but, from the accounts mo&s;t to be re|lied on, they have collected the principal part of their force, from Brun&s;wic and the neighboring po&s;ts, at Princeton, where they are throwing up &s;ome works.

<P>I HAVE the honor to inform you, that, &s;ince the date of my la&s;t from Trenton, I have removed with the army under my
<PB N="9" REF="031423_0305_0FEC5C01A1A59238">
of men, as are colonel Hand's, Smallwood's and the German battalion.&mdash;A few days ago general Warner arrived with about &s;even hundred Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts militia engaged to the fifteenth of March.</P>
<P>Thus you have a &s;ketch of our pre&s;ent army, with which we are obliged to keep up appearances before an enemy already double to us in numbers, and who, from every account are withdrawing their troops from Rhode-I&s;land, to form a juncti|on of their whole army, and make another attempt either to break up ours, or penetrate towards Philadelphia,&mdash;a thing by no means difficult now, as the ice affords an ea&s;y pa&s;&s;age over the Delaware.</P>
<P>I do not yet know what effect general Heath's moving down towards New-York will have.&mdash;Ye&s;terday morning a con&s;ider|able firing was heard, which &s;eemed to be about King&s;bridge. I am in hopes that his appearance on that quarter with a pretty large force will oblige them to withdraw part of theirs from Jer&s;ey, to &s;ecure the city of New-York, which, by late accounts, is weakly garri&s;oned.&mdash;General Heath has all the ea&s;tern and York militia with him, except the &s;mall brigade under general Warner which I mentioned before, one regiment of Connecti|cut, &s;topped at Providence in Rhode-I&s;land, and a number (how many I do not know) reque&s;ted by general Schuyler to be &s;ent to Tyconderoga.&mdash;If it &s;hould appear that they are regardle&s;s of the diver&s;ion made by general Heath, and pre&s;i&s;t in their plan of drawing their whole army together in Jer&s;ey, I mu&s;t order him over with all his troops, except as many as are nece&s;&s;ary to garri&s;on the forts and guard the pa&s;&s;es in the Highlands.</P>
<P>I have ordered away every officer that could be &s;pared,&mdash;&s;ome to recruit, and &s;ome to collect the &s;cattered men of the different regiments, who are di&s;per&s;ed almo&s;t over the continent: for, the va&s;t numbers &s;ent to the ho&s;pitals at different times, few ever returned after they got well.</P>
<P>As militia mu&s;t be our dependence till we can get the new army rai&s;ed and properly arranged, I mu&s;t entreat you to con|tinue your endeavours with the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, Maryland, and Virginia, to turn out every man they po&s;&s;ibly can, and for &s;ome longer time than they have generally &s;tipulated for. If they agree for a month or any limitted time, it &s;hould com|mence from the time they actually join the army, and not from the time they leave their homes: otherwi&s;e the marching back|wards and forwards con&s;umes the term of engagement.</P>
<P>I think the&s;e demands of aid &s;hould be made as quietly as the nature of the ca&s;e will admit of, e&s;pecially at this time

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM favored with yours of the fifteenth in&s;tant, with the &s;undry re&s;olves inclo&s;ed in it. If that re&s;pecting the continen|tal currency is carried &s;trictly into execution, it cannot fail of &s;ully re-e&s;tabli&s;hing its credit.</P>
<P>I have no objection to the three gentlemen who are recom|mended for field-officers in the new Hamp&s;hire regiment: they &s;eem fully entitled to it, as they have rai&s;ed the regiment. I will furni&s;h them with commi&s;&s;ions from the date of their ap|pointment, when applied to for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething particular in the application of colonel Dubois and his officers for the &s;um of five hundred and thirteen dollars and two-thirds. They have been commi&s;&s;ioned provid|ed they &s;hould rai&s;e the men; but, from their own pay-ab&s;tract, it appears that fourteen officers only brought twenty-five men into the field. As they certainly did not comply with their agreement, I would, after &s;tating the matter as it really was, &s;ubmit it to Congre&s;s who have the di&s;po&s;al of the public money.</P>
<P>I have peru&s;ed the petition of mon&s;ieur Faneuil and other French gentlemen. If they could rai&s;e &s;uch a regiment as they propo&s;e, it would certainly be u&s;eful: but I have no con|ception that there are Canadians enough to be &s;ound even for a regiment of the common number, much le&s;s of two thou&s;and three hundred and forty-&s;even, which is the number propo&s;ed. I know, neither colonel Living&s;ton nor colonel Hazen could ever complete their Canadian regiments when they had the country open to them. As I would give encouragement to foreigners of real merit, I would put the thing upon this footing:&mdash;if mon&s;ieur Faneuil can procure a &s;ufficient number of officers to fill a regiment of the common &s;ize, and they can give any a&s;&s;urances of being able to rai&s;e the men I would grant them commi&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>I would beg leave to remark here, that, except we can throw
<PB N="11" REF="031423_0307_0FEC5C0BCC575128">
the many foreigners who have been commi&s;&s;ioned in our army, into a corps together, they will be entirely u&s;ele&s;s, as they can neither conver&s;e with officers nor men in any other kind of regi|ment.</P>
<P>I am &s;o well a&s;&s;ured that you would not recommend doctor Potts to &s;ucceed doctor Stringer in the northern department except you had &s;ufficient proof of his abilities in the medical line that I readily concur with you in the appointment.</P>
<P>I have received a piece of information which I am afraid is true,&mdash;and that is, that the Briti&s;h crui&s;ers have taken a French ve&s;&s;el with a large parcel of cannon and mortars on board. I know &s;uch a one was expected, and therefore more readily credit the account.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY la&s;t to you was on the twentieth in&s;tant. Since that, I have the plea&s;ure to inform you that general Dickin&s;on, with about four hundred militia, has defeated a foraging party of the enemy of an equal number, and has taken forty waggons, and upwards of a hundred hor&s;es, mo&s;t of them of the Engli&s;h draft breed, and a number of &s;heep and cattle which they had collected. The enemy retreated with &s;o much precipitation, that general Dickin&s;on had only an opportunity of making nine pri&s;oners. They were ob&s;erved to carry off a good many dead and wounded in light waggons.&mdash;This action happened near Somer&s;et court-hou&s;e on Mill&s;tone river. General Dickin&s;on's behavior reflects the highe&s;t honor upon him: for, though his troops were all raw, he led them through the river middle-deep, and gave the enemy &s;o &s;evere a charge, that, although &s;upported by three field-pieces, they gave way, and left their convoy.</P>
<P>I have not heard from general Heath, &s;ince the firing near King&s;bridge la&s;t &s;aturday; which I cannot account for, unle&s;s the North-river &s;hould have been rendered impa&s;&s;ible by the ice. But the account of his having &s;urpri&s;ed and taken Fort-Independence on friday night la&s;t comes &s;o well authenticated by different ways, that I cannot doubt it. It is &s;aid that he took four hundred pri&s;oners in that fort, and that he inve&s;ted Fort-Wa&s;hington on &s;aturday, which occa&s;ioned the firing.&mdash;This is brought out by three of our officers who made their e&s;|cape from New-York on &s;unday, and is confirmed by a &s;py who
<PB N="12" REF="031423_0308_0FEC5C4590B9DC40">
went into Amboy, who &s;ays an expre&s;s had arrived at Amboy from New-York, with an account of the lo&s;s of Fort-Inde|pendence, and calling for a reinforcement to protect the city: in con&s;equence of which, a number of troops had gone over.&mdash;I have &s;ent in &s;pies to Brun&s;wic and Amboy to know the truth of this: and if it appears that they have weakened them&s;elves to reinforce New-York, I &s;hall probably make &s;ome attempt upon them, if we have men enough left to do it.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be glad to know what &s;tock of &s;mall-arms you at pre|&s;ent have, and what are your expectations &s;hortly. The nece&s;|&s;ity that we have been and are now under, of calling in and arming the militia &s;catters our armory all over the world in a manner: their officers are &s;o irregular that they generally &s;uf|fer their men to carry home every thing that is put into their hands, which is forever lo&s;t to the public. The new-rai&s;ed regiments will call for a great number of arms; and I do not at pre&s;ent &s;ee how they are to be &s;upplied.</P>
<P>I would again beg leave to recall the attention of Congre&s;s to the appointment of general officers. I will not &s;uppo&s;e the nomination of them is po&s;tponed upon a &s;aving principle, be|cau&s;e the advantage in having proper officers to examine the pay-rolls of their &s;everal regiments, and compare them with the returns of their brigades,&mdash;to &s;ee that the regiments are provided with what is proper, and that no more than a &s;uffici|ency is allowed,&mdash;to keep officers to their duty, and not, while the &s;pirited officer is encountering all the fatigues and hard&s;hips of a rigorous campaign, &s;uffer a number of others, under vari|ous frivolous pretences and imaginary &s;ickne&s;&s;es, to enjoy them|&s;elves at the public expen&s;e at their own fire&s;ides:&mdash;I &s;ay, if the appointments are withheld upon par&s;imonious principles, the Congre&s;s are mi&s;taken: for I am convinced, that, by the correction of many abu&s;es which it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to at|tend to, the public will be benefited in a great degree in the article of expen&s;e.&mdash;But this is not all.&mdash;We have a very lit|tle time to do a very great work in. The arranging, providing for, and di&s;ciplining a hundred and odd battalions is not to be accompli&s;hed in a day; nor is it to be done at all with any de|gree of propriety, when we have once entered upon the active part of a campaign. The&s;e duties mu&s;t be branched out, or they will be neglected, and the public injured. Be&s;ides, were the brigadiers appointed, they might be facilitating the recruit|ing &s;ervice; they would have time to get a little acquainted with their brigades, the wants of them, and ca&s;e me of the great weight and burden which I at pre&s;ent feel.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="031423_0309_0FEC5BF7C220E818">
On whom the choice will or ought to light, I cannot under|take to &s;ay. In a former letter I took the liberty of &s;ubmit|ting to the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s the propriety of appoint|ing, out of each &s;tate, brigadiers to command the troops of that &s;tate,&mdash;thinking, as a di&s;tinction is now fixed, a &s;pirit of emula|tion might ari&s;e by this means. At any rate I &s;hall take the liberty of recommending general Cadwallader as one of the fir&s;t for the new appointments. I have found him a man of a|bility, a good di&s;ciplinarian, firm in his principles, and of intre|pid bravery. I &s;hall al&s;o beg leave to recommend colonel Reed to the command of the hor&s;e, as a per&s;on, in my opinion, every way qualified: for he is extremely active and enterpri&s;|ing: many &s;ignal proofs of which he has given this campaign. For the re&s;t, the members of Congre&s;s can judge better than I can: I can only &s;ay, that, as the army will probably be divided in the cour&s;e of the next campaign, there ought, in my opini|on, to be three lieutenant-generals, nine major-generals, and twenty-&s;even brigadiers:&mdash;in other words, there ought, at lea&s;t to be a brigadier to every four regiments, and a major-general to every three brigades.&mdash;The lieutenant-generals will, I pre|&s;ume, be appointed out of the olde&s;t major-generals, and the major-generals from the olde&s;t brigadiers. Nine brigadiers will then be to nominate.</P>
<P>I forgot before this to inform Congre&s;s, that, including the regiment of light dragoons from Virginia, and colonel Sheldon's to be rai&s;ed in Connecticut, I have only commi&s;&s;ioned officers for four regiments. I was willing to try how the&s;e could be e|quipped before I put more officers into commi&s;&s;ion. It is ap|prehended we &s;hall find difficulty in providing nece&s;&s;aries or e|ven hor&s;es for the&s;e four regiments: if we &s;hould not, I &s;hall immediately &s;et about the re&s;idue. Colonel Baylor, colonel Moylan (who, as volunteer has remained con&s;tantly with the ar|my &s;ince his di&s;continuance in the quarter-ma&s;ter's department, and colonel Sheldon, command the three new regiments of light dragoons.</P>
<P>The trea&s;ury has been for &s;ome time empty, and the army has labored under the greate&s;t inconvenience for the want of money. The recruiting &s;ervice is particularly injured by this, as many officers are now waiting only for bounty-money. I have al&s;o complaints from the ea&s;tward of the want of money to car|ry on their recruiting &s;ervice.&mdash;If we are not &s;upplied with that nece&s;&s;ary article, all matters mu&s;t be at a &s;tand. I mu&s;t there|fore, beg that, if Mr. Palfrey has not been already &s;upplied with a large &s;um, it may be done with the utmo&s;t expedition,

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS la&s;t night honored with yours of the eighteenth in&s;tant, inclo&s;ing a letter from the &s;tate of New-York to Con|gre&s;s. From the particular &s;ituation of their &s;tate in regard to their being totally deprived of commerce, they certainly mu&s;t &s;tand in need of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the other &s;tates to provide them with clothing and every thing nece&s;&s;ary for the equipment of their forces; and it ever was my intention to allow them a full proportion of the clothing purcha&s;ed to the ea&s;tward, whenever it came to hand. Little or none of it has reached this army, though in the greate&s;t want, and expo&s;ed to the &s;e|verities of a winter campaign.</P>
<P>The convention have in one in&s;tance already provided for them&s;elves out of the public &s;tock by &s;topping and making u&s;e of twenty-&s;ix bales of clothing coming on from the ea&s;tward to the army here. As this was done without con&s;ulting me, I took the liberty of de&s;iring them not to do the like in future; not that I meant to deprive them of their &s;hare, but becau&s;e it di&s;appointed me of many articles which I &s;tood in immediate want of, and had not provided from other quarters. But you may be a&s;&s;ured, that, whenever returns are to be made of the whole &s;tock of clothing, they &s;hall have their proportion, and more than that&mdash;allowance for their peculiar &s;ituation.</P>
<P>I am amazed to hear complaints of the ho&s;pital on the ea&s;t &s;ide of Hud&s;on's-river. Doctor Morgan, with mo&s;t of his mates has been con&s;tantly there &s;ince I left it with the main body of the army. It is in vain however to look back upon pa&s;t misfor|tunes. I will not pretend to point out the cau&s;es; but I know matters have been &s;trangely conducted in the medical line. I hope your new appointment, when it is made, will make the nece&s;&s;ary reform in the ho&s;pital, and that I &s;hall not, the next campaign, have my ears, and eyes too, &s;hocked with the com|plaints and looks of poor creatures peri&s;hing for want of proper care either in the regimental or ho&s;pital &s;urgeons.</P>
<P>I agree with the convention in the expediency of ob&s;tructing
<PB N="15" REF="031423_0311_0FEC47EF28288C50">
the pa&s;&s;age of the North-river in &s;ome, place between the mouth and the Highlands. We have found that our labor and expen&s;e has been thrown away in endeavoring to do it below, where the channel is amazingly wide and deep: but, from the &s;light view I have had of the river above, I think the pa&s;&s;age may be ea&s;i|ly ob&s;tructed, and defended by proper fortifications, as the ri|ver is &s;o narrow that no ve&s;&s;el going up could po&s;&s;ibly e&s;cape the fire. I am no judge of what can be done towards fitting out the frigates at Poughkeep&s;ie:&mdash;that mu&s;t be left to the gentlemen of the marine committee.</P>
<P>The hint given by the convention of New-York, of the ne|ce&s;&s;ity and utility of a commi&s;&s;ary of forage, had &s;truck me be|fore, and had been mentioned by general Mifflin, who&s;e depart|ment of quarter-ma&s;ter-general mu&s;t be ea&s;ed of part of the load which is at pre&s;ent thrown upon it. He is obliged in ma|ny in&s;tances to act entirely out of his proper line; and in&s;tead of being confined to the duty of quarter-ma&s;ter-general, is al&s;o waggon-ma&s;ter, and forage-ma&s;ter-general,&mdash;I have wrote to two per&s;ons that I think qualified to fill the office of waggon-ma&s;ter; and I hope one of them will accept.&mdash;That of commi&s;|&s;ary of forage &s;hall be attended to.</P>
<P>The want of accurate maps of the country which has hither|to been the &s;cene of war has been of great di&s;advantage to me. I have in vain endeavored to procure them, and have been o|bliged to make &s;hift with &s;uch &s;ketches as I could trace out from my own ob&s;ervation and that of gentlemen around me. I really think, if gentlemen of known character and probity could be employed in making maps (from actual &s;urvey) of the roads,&mdash;the rivers, and bridges and fords over them,&mdash;the mountains, and pa&s;&s;es through them,&mdash;it would be of the greate&s;t advan|tage.</P>
<P>I had, previous to the receipt of your letter, wrote to gene|ral Howe, and propo&s;ed the fixing an agent for pri&s;oners at New-York. I have not received an an&s;wer: but if he accedes to the propo&s;al, I &s;hall appoint Mr. Lewis Pintard.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry that I am obliged to contradict the report of the taking of Fort-Independence as mentioned in my la&s;t. I be|lieve the evacuation of &s;ome detached redoubts gave ri&s;e to the report.&mdash;I have not heard from general Heath &s;ince the fourteenth in&s;tant, which I am amazed at. I am quite in the dark as to his numbers, and what progre&s;s he has made.</P>
<P>On the twenty-third, a party of four hundred of our men, under colonel * * *, fell in with two of the regiments of the enemy, convoying a number of waggons from Brun&s;wic to Am|boy.
<PB N="16" REF="031423_0312_0FEC47B15B27D7E0">
Our advanced party under colonel Parker engaged them with great bravery upwards of twenty minutes, during which time the colonel commandant was killed, and the &s;econd in com|mand mortally wounded. The people living near the field of action &s;ay their killed and wounded were con&s;iderable. We lo&s;t only two men, who were made pri&s;oners. Had colonel * * * come up with the main body, colonel Parker and the o|ther officers think we &s;hould have put them to the rout, as their confu&s;ion was very great and their ground di&s;advantageous. I have ordered * * * under arre&s;t, and &s;hall bring him to trial to an&s;wer for &s;o extraordinary a piece of conduct.</P>
<P>Reinforcements come up &s;o extremely &s;low, that I am afraid I &s;hall be left without any men before they arrive. The ene|my mu&s;t be ignorant of our numbers, or they have not hor&s;es to remove their artillery, or they would not &s;uffer us to remain undi&s;turbed. I have repeatedly wrote to all the recruiting of|ficers, to forward on their men as fa&s;t as they could arm and clothe them: but they are &s;o extremely aver&s;e to turning out of comfortable quarters, that I cannot get a man to come near me, though I hear from all parts that the recruiting &s;ervice goes on with great &s;ucce&s;s. It would be well if the board of war, in who&s;e department it is, would i&s;&s;ue orders for all officers to equip and forward their recruits to head-quarters with the greate&s;t expedition.</P>
<P>By a re&s;olve of Congre&s;s pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time ago, general Schuyler is directed to apply to me for ninety-four tons of powder,&mdash;a quantity which it is impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould have by me, and for which I do not know where to direct him to apply. I could wi&s;h that returns were made to me of the quantity of powder on hand, and where it is to be found, that I may not be at a lo&s;s at any time of emergency.</P>
<P>Since the re&s;ignation of colonel Reed, the important office of adjutant-general has been left unfilled (I mean as to a princi|pal), and I am much at a lo&s;s how or where to find a per&s;on in every way capable and proper to execute the office. My inclinations lead me to confer the appointment upon a major Morris: but ample te&s;timonials &s;hould be produced, and full proof of fidelity ought to be made, before an office of &s;o high tru&s;t &s;hould be conferred upon a per&s;on in a manner a &s;tranger to me. I only know major Morris from a &s;hort per&s;onal ac|quaintance, and from report: he never even brought a letter of recommendation to me. From his conver&s;ation and from the accounts I have received from others, he is a man of con&s;idera|ble military abilities; and, from his behavior in two in&s;tan|ces,
<PB N="17" REF="031423_0313_0FEC5C4E2FB5B308">
he is a man of bravery and conduct. His &s;tory is &s;imply this,&mdash;that he left the Briti&s;h &s;ervice in di&s;gu&s;t, upon not receiv|ing a promotion to which he was ju&s;tly entitled. Perhaps &s;ome gentlemen of Congre&s;s may know more about him, or may be able to make &s;uch inquiries as might &s;atisfy them as to the &s;afe|ty and propriety of appointing him. I have no other motive for wi&s;hing him a preference than that I think him the proper|e&s;t per&s;on that has come under my notice, provided all mat|ters before mentioned were cleared up.&mdash;I &s;hall wait the re|&s;ult of a determination of Congre&s;s before I proceed further in this appointment; and I wi&s;h to be favored with their advice as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible; for the remains of the old army is much di&s;arranged for want of a good adjutant-general, and the forma|tion of the new in a great mea&s;ure depends upon an able officer in that line.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE none of your favors un-an&s;wered at pre&s;ent.&mdash;There is &s;uch a demand upon me from all quarters for money, which I am unable to an&s;wer, that I cannot help again pre&s;&s;ing you to &s;end on a &s;upply. The recruiting &s;ervice is almo&s;t at a &s;top here for want of money; and governor Trumbull writes me word that it is totally &s;o in Connecticut. He adds that their loan officers cannot proceed in their bu&s;ine&s;s for want of proper check-books and notes: but that, if they were furni&s;hed with them, they could &s;oon take in a &s;ufficient quantity to an|&s;wer their purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be glad to be informed whether I have a right to draw warrants upon the loan-officers in the different &s;tates.&mdash;The &s;tates of Connecticut advanced colonel Sheldon, at my re|que&s;t, ten thou&s;and pounds lawful, to rai&s;e his regiment of hor&s;e. For their reimbur&s;ement they de&s;ired me to give them a draught upon the loan-office: but, not knowing whether I had a right to draw upon that fund, I deferred it till I heard from you.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t beg you to write to the a&s;&s;emblies of the different &s;tates, and in&s;i&s;t upon the pa&s;&s;ing a law to inflict a &s;evere and heavy penalty upon tho&s;e who harbor de&s;erters, knowing them to be &s;uch. Our army is &s;hamefully reduced by de&s;ertion; and, except the people in the country can be forced to give informa|tion when de&s;erters return to their old neighborhoods, we
<PB N="18" REF="031423_0314_0FEC5C5043E6BBC8">
&s;hall be obliged to detach one half of the army to bring back the other.</P>
<P>I have a letter from general Heath, of the twenty-fourth in|&s;tant. He was at and near King&s;bridge with his army. I do not find that he is likely to do more than to draw the attention of the enemy that way, and to cut them off from forage, of which they are in great want.&mdash;The troops had not returned from Rhode-I&s;land, by the la&s;t accounts, but were daily ex|pected.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM honored with yours of the twenty-fourth of Janua|ry, with &s;undry re&s;olves of Congre&s;s, and a petition of mon&s;ieur Pelli&s;ier's inclo&s;ed. I am not the proper [<HI>per&s;on</HI>] to refer the petition to, as I am no judge of his merit as an engineer, having never had an opportunity of &s;eeing any of his performances. At any rate I do not &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of appointing him or any other per&s;on principal engineer at Ticonderoga: for that would ex|clude any other, though of &s;uperior abilities, from being &s;ent there. Be&s;ides, as a corps of engineers will in all probability be &s;oon e&s;tabli&s;hed, mon&s;ieur Pelli&s;ier's rank can then be &s;ettled with more propriety.</P>
<P>I forgot to mention in any of my former letters that I had appointed captain Nathaniel Gue&s;t of Virginia to the command of a regiment to be rai&s;ed upon the frontiers of Virginia and Carolina; and I have directed him, if po&s;&s;ible, to bring a com|pany or two of Cherokee Indians. If they can be procured, they will an&s;wer two valuable purpo&s;es,&mdash;one, as excellent &s;couts, the other that they will be in fact ho&s;tages, and will &s;e|cure the good behavior of their nation.</P>
<P>Major Bland, commandant of the Virginia hor&s;e, has de&s;ired to know whether there is not a nece&s;&s;ity of giving a bounty and re-enli&s;ting his regiment as continental troops. They were en|li&s;ted to &s;erve in the colony; and the men were with &s;ome dif|ficulty prevailed upon to march hither: but the major thinks they would be entirely reconciled upon receiving the bounty.</P>
<P>I received a letter from Mr. Cha&s;e, de&s;iring I would appoint proper per&s;ons to make inquiry into and take di&s;po&s;itions con|cerning the behavior of the Briti&s;h and foreign troops in Jer|&s;ey. This would be an endle&s;s ta&s;k, as their line of march is
<PB N="19" REF="031423_0315_0FEC5C5209385230">
marked with deva&s;tation, and is a thing of &s;uch public notorie|ty that it demands no further proof.</P>
<P>I remon&s;trated with general Howe upon the treatment of our wounded at Princeton. You will &s;ee by the inclo&s;ed letter from him, that he di&s;avows and dete&s;ts the proceeding: but I fear that too much encouragement is given to &s;uch barbarous behavior by the Briti&s;h officers; for, in a late &s;kirmi&s;h, in which &s;ir William Er&s;kine commanded, lieutenant Kelly of the fifth Virginia regiment was &s;lightly wounded in the thigh; but, before he could get off the field, he was overtaken and murder|ed in a mo&s;t cruel manner. General Stephen informed me that he would write to &s;ir William, and inform him, that, unle&s;s &s;uch practices were put a &s;top to, our &s;oldiers would not be re&s;train|ed from making retaliation.</P>
<P>By a letter from general Heath, of the thirtieth of la&s;t month, I find that he had decamped from the neighborhood of King&s;|bridge, and removed back towards the White-Plains. His rea|&s;ons for doing &s;o were that the troops could not &s;tand the in|clemency of the weather, and that he feared the troops expect|ed from Rhode-I&s;land would land upon his back. I have however directed him to leave a body of light troops under an active officer, in order to harra&s;s their foraging parties, and to cover our own who are to remove as much of the forage from We&s;t-Che&s;ter county as they can: and, after leaving as many men as will &s;ecure the pa&s;&s;es in the Highlands, the remainder are to be &s;ent over here to join me; for I am apprehen&s;ive that the enemy are reinforcing them&s;elves at Brun&s;wic.</P>
<P>I &s;hall to-morrow &s;end out parties from every quarter, to re|move all the waggons, hor&s;es, cattle and &s;heep, or as many as po&s;&s;ible, from the neighborhood of the enemy's lines. They are to attend particularly to the hor&s;es: for if we can reduce tho&s;e that they at pre&s;ent have, and can hinder them from get|ting fre&s;h ones from the adjacent country it will be impo&s;&s;ible for them to move their artillery and waggons forward, &s;hould they incline to make another pu&s;h towards Philadelphia.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve by your la&s;t re&s;olves that the militia of Baltimore, Hartford, and Cecil counties in Maryland, are ordered out and to march this way. Let me entreat you to &s;uffer none to go forward to Philadelphia but what are equipped with arms, accoutrements and blankets: they hurt the &s;ervice much by taking tho&s;e things only for a &s;hort time from the continental troops, many of whom would otherwi&s;e be enabled to take the field.</P>
<P>The &s;ecretary of the board of war has tran&s;mitted me ex|tracts
<PB N="20" REF="031423_0316_0FEC5C5DF7AFC878">
of general Schuyler's letters in which he calls pre&s;&s;ingly for &s;ome general officers to be &s;ent to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. This will &s;hew you the nece&s;&s;ity of immediately making the promotions recommended in mine of the twenty &s;econd of January: for at pre&s;ent I cannot &s;pare a general officer from this quarter with|out injuring the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Nothing of con&s;equence has happened &s;ince I wrote to you la&s;t, except a &s;kirmi&s;h on the fir&s;t of this month, five or &s;ix miles from Brun&s;wic-landing, between our advanced parties (about &s;even hundred in the whole) and upwards of two thou|&s;and of the enemy, under &s;ir William Er&s;kine. The heat of the engagement was [<HI>borne by</HI>] colonel Scott of the fir&s;t Vir|ginia regiment, who, with about a hundred men, beat back two hundred of the Briti&s;h grenadiers. Several other officers be|haved with great &s;pirit; but there is &s;ome rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that colonel * * *, who commanded our main body, did not behave altogether as he ought. I have ordered a court upon him, that the matter may be fairly canva&s;&s;ed, and that he may &s;tand condemned or acquitted by the evidence of tho&s;e who were pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Colonel * * *, who was under arre&s;t upon a charge of cow|ardice, broke his parole and went over to Bucks-county, I &s;up|po&s;e with an intent to make his e&s;cape: but I di&s;patched a troop of light-hor&s;e after him, who brought him back ye&s;ter|day: and he is to take his trial on friday.</P>
<P>The &s;mall-pox has made &s;uch head in every quarter, that I find it impo&s;&s;ible to keep it from &s;preading through the whole army in the natural way. I have therefore determined, not only to inoculate all the troops now here that have not had it, but &s;hall order Dr. Shippen to inoculate the recruits as fa&s;t as they come in to Philadelphia. They will lo&s;e no time, becau&s;e they will go through the di&s;order while their clothing, arms and accoutrements are getting ready.</P>
<P>From the fir&s;t in&s;titution of civil government, it has been the national policy of every precedent &s;tate to endeavor to engage its members to the di&s;charge of their public duty by the obli|gation of &s;ome oath: its force and happy influence has been felt in too many in&s;tances, to need any arguments to &s;upport the policy or prove its utility. I have often thought the &s;tates have been too negligent in this particular, and am more fully convinced of it from the effect general Howe's excurtion has produced in New-Jer&s;ey.&mdash;An oath is the only &s;ub&s;titute that can be adopted to &s;upply the defect of principle.&mdash;By our in|attention in this article, we lo&s;e a con&s;iderable cement to our
<PB N="21" REF="031423_0317_0FEC5C0D8890A468">
own force, and give the enemy an opportunity to make the fir&s;t tender to the oath of allegiance to the king. Its baneful in|fluence is but too &s;everely felt at this time. The people gene|rally co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e&s;s that they were compelled to take protection, and &s;ub&s;cribe the <HI>Declaration:</HI> yet it furni&s;hes many with argu|ments to refu&s;e taking any active part: and further they alledge them&s;elves bound to a neutrality at lea&s;t. Many con&s;cientious people who were well-wi&s;hers to the cau&s;e, had they been bound to the &s;tates by an oath, would have &s;uffered any puni&s;h|ment rather than have taken the oath of allegiance to the king; and are now lo&s;t to our intere&s;t for want of this nece&s;&s;ary tie.&mdash;Notwith&s;tanding the obligation of the <HI>A&s;&s;ociation,</HI> they do not conceive it to have the &s;ame effect as an oath.&mdash;The more u|nited the inhabitants appear, the greater difficulty general Howe will have in reconciling them to regal government, and con&s;equently the le&s;s hope of conquering them.&mdash;For the&s;e rea|&s;ons and many more that might be urged, I &s;hould &s;trongly re|commend every &s;tate to fix upon &s;ome oath or affirmation of allegiance to be tendered to all the inhabitants without excep|tion, and to outlaw tho&s;e that refu&s;e it.</P>

The fir&s;t produced a commi&s;&s;ion &s;igned by you in November la&s;t, appointing him a major of artillery: but, by the inclo&s;ed letter from him to me, he claims much higher rank under the promi&s;e of Congre&s;s,&mdash;that of commandant of the continental artillery.&mdash;Whether any &s;uch promi&s;e was made, I leave you to determine.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I had the honor of addre&s;&s;ing you on the fifth in|&s;tant, no event of an important and intere&s;ting nature has oc|curred, unle&s;s the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of our parties in foraging and bring|ing off hor&s;es, waggons, and &s;ome fat cattle and &s;heep, which were contiguous to and around the enemy's lines, are con&s;ider|ed as &s;uch. I then mentioned that I had &s;uch a &s;cheme in con|templation, which was happily accompli&s;hed the next day with|out any lo&s;s. The enemy in turn have made frequent efforts in that way, but with little &s;ucce&s;s. Whenever they made the attempt, it never failed to produce a &s;kirmi&s;h. They have been common of late, but with little damage to either &s;ide.</P>
<P>We have certain intelligence that they have drawn the greate&s;t part of their troops from Rhode-I&s;land, and are told that part of them have landed on Staten-I&s;land and at Am|boy, with a view of augmenting their force at Brun&s;wic.</P>
<P>Colonel * * *, agreeable to the information contained in my la&s;t, has been tried by a court-martial, and ca&s;hiered. The proceedings and &s;entence I directed to be tran&s;mitted to the &s;ecretary of the war-office, and to the printers of this &s;tate and Virginia, to be publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>General Lincoln is ju&s;t arrived with a regiment of Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts militia, about two hundred and fifty. This, he &s;ays, is &s;ucceeded by three more, which will make in the whole near eighteen hundred: but in this I think he mu&s;t be mi&s;taken, un|le&s;s tho&s;e on the march are much fuller and larger than what they u&s;ually are. The whole are of the troops that were with general Heath.</P>
<P>General Knox, by a letter of the fir&s;t in&s;tant, informs me, that, on mature inquiry and examination, he finds Springfield to be more convenient and much better calculated for an ela|boratory and cannon-foundery, than any other part of the New-England &s;tates. He adds that a quantity of copper, tin, and o|ther u&s;eful materials, can be had there; and that the nece&s;&s;ary works and preparations, from the&s;e and other advantages, can be accompli&s;hed at lea&s;t three or four months &s;ooner there than any where el&s;e. In con&s;equence of his opinion, which I e&s;|teem of weight, particularly in this in&s;tance,&mdash;and knowing the
<PB N="23" REF="031423_0319_0FEC47EB876D7570">
importance of, and how e&s;&s;ential the&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments are,&mdash;I have ventured to order the works to be begun there, without regard to what had been done at Brookfield, which was of but little con&s;equence. The former, be&s;ides the many advantages mentioned by general Knox, &s;tands on Connecticut-river, and has a good navigation: yet is entirely &s;ecure again&s;t any at|tempts of the enemy, being twenty miles above Hartford, where the river is narrow, and too &s;hoal to admit ve&s;&s;els that can give the lea&s;t annoyance.&mdash;As nothing but the good of the &s;ervice could have led to this mea&s;ure, I tru&s;t it will be ap|proved.</P>
<P>I have wrote to the a&s;&s;embly of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts &s;tate and the convention of New-Hamp&s;hire, reque&s;ting their good offices and exertions to promote the rai&s;ing of their regiments as ex|peditiou&s;ly as po&s;&s;ible, and to forward the whole of the quotas fir&s;t exacted from them, to Ticonderoga. Their contiguity to that po&s;t more than to any other,&mdash;the importance of it, and general Schuyler's apprehen&s;ions that the enemy may attempt to pa&s;s the lake (if not on the ice) as &s;oon as it is open,&mdash;add|ed to the great trouble, expen&s;e, and lo&s;s of time it will &s;ave in marching them el&s;ewhere, and others there, who are much more di&s;tant and remote,&mdash;induced me to determine &s;o. I find the council of the former, on general Schuyler's earne&s;t appli|cation, before my letter reached them, had determined to &s;end four regiments as &s;oon as they could be completed. I only wi&s;h the whole may be made up in a &s;hort time, and that their arrival may be early enough to prevent tho&s;e inconveniences and fatal con&s;equences which the want of a &s;ufficient force in that quarter would &s;ubject us to, were the enemy to pa&s;s the lakes at this time.</P>
<P>Mr. James Mea&s;e is now here in con&s;equence of being ap|pointed clothier-general. He is adju&s;ting a plan for an&s;wering the end of his appointment, and making an e&s;timate, to be laid before Congre&s;s or their &s;ecret committee, of &s;uch clothes as may be nece&s;&s;ary to import for the army.</P>
<P>It is with much concern that the &s;ituation of our affairs o|bliges me to mention &s;o frequently the want of money, e&s;peci|ally when I am per&s;uaded every means are u&s;ed to furni&s;h it. Our di&s;tre&s;s on this account is great indeed; and the injury the &s;ervice receives, almo&s;t inconceivable:&mdash;not a day, an hour, or &s;carcely a minute pa&s;&s;es, without complaints and applications on this head.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DO my&s;elf the honor to inclo&s;e you a plan drawn up by doctor Shippen in concert with doctor Cochran, for the arrange|ment and future regulation of the general ho&s;pital. As this plan is very exten&s;ive, the appointments numerous, and the &s;alaries affixed to them at pre&s;ent, large, I did not think my&s;elf at liberty to adopt any part of it before I laid it before Con|gre&s;s for their approbation. I will ju&s;t remark, that, though the expen&s;e attending an ho&s;pital upon the inclo&s;ed plan will be very great, it will in the end not only be &s;aving to the pub|lic, but the only po&s;&s;ible method of keeping an army a foot.</P>
<P>We are now, at an enormous bounty, and with no &s;mall diffi|culty, recruiting an army of upwards of a hundred battalions. The en&s;uing campaign may, from the &s;ame cau&s;es, prove as &s;ickly as the la&s;t: and if the ho&s;pitals are in no better condition for the reception of the &s;ick, our regiments will be reduced to companies by the end of the campaign; and tho&s;e poor wretch|es who e&s;cape with life will be either &s;cattered up and down the country, and not to be found, or if found, totally enervated and unfit for further duty. By the&s;e means not only the boun|ty is lo&s;t, but the man is lo&s;t al&s;o: and I leave you to judge whether we have men enough to allow of &s;uch a con&s;umption of lives and con&s;titutions as have been lo&s;t the la&s;t compaign. For my own part I am certain, that, if the army which I hope we &s;hall have in the field this year is &s;uffered to moulder away by &s;ickne&s;s as it did the la&s;t, we mu&s;t look for reinforcements to &s;ome other places than our own &s;tates.</P>
<P>The number of officers mentioned in the inclo&s;ed plan I pre|&s;ume are nece&s;&s;ary for us, becau&s;e they are found &s;o in the Bri|ti&s;h ho&s;pitals: and, as they are e&s;tabli&s;hed on the &s;ure&s;t ba&s;is,&mdash;that of long experience under the able&s;t phy&s;icians and &s;ur|geons,&mdash;we &s;hould not he&s;itate a moment in adopting their re|gulations, when they &s;o plainly tend to correct and improve our former want of method and knowledge in this important depart|ment.</P>
<P>The pay affixed to the different appointments is, as I &s;aid be|fore, great, and perhaps more than you may think adequate to
<PB N="25" REF="031423_0321_0FEC5D45420B5C78">
the &s;ervice. In determining upon the &s;um that is to be allow|ed to each, you ought to con&s;ider that it &s;hould be &s;uch as will induce gentlemen of character and &s;kill in their profe&s;&s;ion to &s;tep forth, and in &s;ome manner adequate to the practice which they have at home: for, unle&s;s &s;uch gentlemen are induced to take the care and management of our ho&s;pitals, we had better tru&s;t to the force of nature and con&s;titution, than &s;uffer per&s;ons entirely ignorant of medicine to de&s;troy us by ill-directed appli|cations.</P>
<P>I hear from every quarter that the dread of undergoing the &s;ame mi&s;eries for want of proper care and attention when &s;ick, has much retarded the new enli&s;tments, particularly to the &s;outh|ward. This is another rea&s;on for e&s;tabli&s;hing our ho&s;pitals up|on a large and generous plan: for we ought to make the &s;er|vice as agreeable and enticing as po&s;&s;ible to the &s;oldiery, many of whom (e&s;pecially when we call forth the militia) not only quit the comforts but the luxuries of life.</P>
<P>A few days ago doctor * * * &s;ent me the inclo&s;ed manu&s;cript, which is a vindication of his conduct, upon which he de&s;ires a court of inquiry may be held. I tran&s;mit it to you by his di|rection. As I do not know what particular charges were al|ledged again&s;t him, I can &s;ay nothing to it or about it. You will find a plan of his al&s;o inclo&s;ed, for the better regulation of the ho&s;pital: but I think all his hints are included in doctor Shippen's plan.</P>
<P>As no time is to be lo&s;t in appointing the nece&s;&s;ary officers, fixing upon the proper places for ho&s;pitals, and many other preparations. I could wi&s;h that Congre&s;s would take this mat|ter under their immediate con&s;ideration, and favor me with their &s;entiments thereon as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>

<P>THE principal de&s;ign of this is to inform you that we have &s;trong rea&s;ons to believe that the enemy are on the point of making &s;ome pu&s;h. What their object is,&mdash;whether to beat up our quarters and to extend their own, to make a large fo|rage and collection of provender of which they are in great want, or to turn their views towards the Delaware,&mdash;is a mat|ter of uncertainty; but it &s;eems probable that one of the&s;e things they have in contemplation. Such of their troops as have returned from Rhode-I&s;land have landed at Amboy, and,
<PB N="26" REF="031423_0322_0FEC5C606DC6CFA0">
with them &s;everal pieces of heavy artillery General Howe is come over too, and, it is &s;aid lord Percy. Their number at Brun&s;wic and the landing-place, before the arrival of this la&s;t reinforcement, was e&s;timated from &s;even to eight thou&s;and.</P>
<P>I have ordered the utmo&s;t vigilance and attention to be ob|&s;erved at our &s;everal po&s;ts, to guard again&s;t &s;urpri&s;es, and every preparation to be made that the weak and feeble &s;tate of our little army will admit of. At this time we are only about four thou&s;and &s;trong,&mdash;a force, you will &s;uppo&s;e, unequal to a &s;uc|ce&s;sful oppo&s;ition, if they were not militia, and far too &s;mall for the exigencies of our affairs. It is impo&s;&s;ible to obtain exact returns, though they are daily called for,&mdash;owing to the fre|quent and almo&s;t con&s;tant departure of &s;ome of the corps.</P>
<P>Colonel Neil&s;on of Brun&s;wic, with a detachment of militia, on the morning of the eighteenth, &s;urpri&s;ed major Stockdon, whom he took with fifty-nine privates of general Skinner's corps, killing four, and bringing away the arms of the whole, with &s;ome blankets. This about balances the lo&s;s of a militia guard which a party of Briti&s;h troops took la&s;t week in Mon|mouth, near the Hook.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h to be informed how the regiments that are rai&s;ing are to be armed, and of the provi&s;ion that has been made for the &s;ame. I have rea&s;on to fear, indeed I am convinced, that there is a great deficiency in many, if not in the whole of the &s;tates, in this article: every letter that I receive from them mentions their want, and calls for &s;upplies.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MONSIEUR Fan&eacute;uil, who &s;ome time ago laid a plan be|fore you for rai&s;ing and officering a corps of Frenchmen, waited upon me ye&s;terday. His &s;ucce&s;s, as I expected, has been &s;mall in enli&s;ting or rather engaging Canadians. I cannot find that he has met with more than thirty or forty who would be willing to &s;erve with him. He is now upon another &s;cheme,&mdash;that of rai&s;ing, arming, and clothing a number of men in the French i&s;lands.&mdash;To grant a commi&s;&s;ion of that kind is without the ex|tent of my powers, and I have therefore de&s;ired him to go for|ward, and lay his propo&s;als before Congre&s;s. If they appear fea&s;ible they may be adopted: but I would beg leave to ob&s;erve that one precaution will be nece&s;&s;ary, that is, that the commi&s;&s;i|ons of mon&s;ieur Ean&eacute;uil and his officers &s;hould depend upon the
<PB N="27" REF="031423_0323_0FEC5C181E166C50">
performance of their agreement for rai&s;ing any certain number of men.</P>
<P>I have often mentioned to you the di&s;tre&s;s I am every now and then laid under by the application of French officers for com|mi&s;&s;ions in our &s;ervice. This evil, if I may call it &s;o, is a grow|ing one: for, from what I learn, they are coming in &s;warms from old France and the i&s;lands. There will therefore be a ne|ce&s;&s;ity of providing for them or di&s;countenancing them. To do the fir&s;t is difficult; and the la&s;t, di&s;agreeable, and perhaps im|politic if they are men of merit:&mdash;and it is impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;tin|gui&s;h the&s;e from mere adventurers, of whom. I am convinced, there are the greate&s;t number. They &s;eldom bring more than a commi&s;&s;ion and pa&s;&s;port, which, we know, may belong to a bad as well as a good officer.</P>
<P>Their ignorance of our language, and their inability to re|cruit men, are un&s;urmountable ob&s;tacles to their being ingraft|ed into our continental battalions: for our officers, who have rai&s;ed their men, and have &s;erved through the war upon pay that has hitherto not borne their expen&s;es, would be di&s;gu&s;ted if foreigners were put over their heads:&mdash;and I a&s;&s;ure you, few or none of the&s;e gentlemen look lower than field-officers' com|mi&s;&s;ions. To give them all brevets, by which they have rank and draw pay without doing any &s;ervice, is &s;addling the conti|nent with a va&s;t expen&s;e: and to form them into corps, would be only e&s;tabli&s;hing corps of officers; for, as I &s;aid before, they cannot po&s;&s;ibly rai&s;e any men.</P>
<P>Some general mode of di&s;po&s;ing of them mu&s;t be adopted; for it is ungenerous to keep them in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and at great charge to them&s;elves: but I am at a lo&s;s how to point out this mode.&mdash;Suppo&s;e they were told in general, that no man could obtain a commi&s;&s;ion, except he could rai&s;e a number of men in proportion to his rank. This would effectually &s;top the mouths of common appliers, and would leave us at liberty to make pro|vi&s;ion for gentlemen of undoubted military character and merit, who would be very u&s;eful to us as &s;oon as they acquired our language.</P>
<P>If you approve of this, or can think of any better method, be plea&s;ed to inform me as &s;oon as you po&s;&s;ibly can: for, if I had a deci&s;ive an&s;wer to give them, it would not only &s;ave me much trouble, but much time, which I am now obliged to be|&s;tow in hearing their different pretentions to merit, and their expectations thereupon.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>CONGRESS having re&s;olved that &s;everal regiments of cavalry &s;hould be rai&s;ed to form a part of their army, I beg leave, through you, to lay before them the inclo&s;ed li&s;t of offi|cers which appear nece&s;&s;ary to be appointed to each corps, and which they will be plea&s;ed to e&s;tabli&s;h. At the &s;ame time I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e it highly expedient to fix their pay and that of the privates. There is now one regiment in &s;ervice, and three more recruiting: this makes it indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary that it &s;hould be done. Applications are con&s;tantly making, to know what the pay is, and objections rai&s;ed again&s;t the &s;ervice for want of due information.</P>
<P>I have tran&s;mitted a li&s;t of &s;uch pay as &s;eemed to be thought rea&s;onable for part of the officers to receive when colonel Shel|don's regiment was directed to be levied, and a copy of the memorandum made at that time. This, colonel Sheldon con|ceived, would not be more than adequate to their &s;ervices, trouble, and expen&s;e, and which in &s;ome degree was founded on the opinions of other gentlemen of whom inquiry was made upon the &s;ubject. I did not fix it in the in&s;tances where it is &s;et down with certainty, as the memorandum will &s;hew. A cri|terion, by which I was al&s;o governed upon that occa&s;ion, was the re&s;olve appointing Mr. Sheldon lieutenant-colonel comman|dant with the rank and pay of colonel. From thence I attempt|ed to proportion that of &s;ome other officers.&mdash;Upon the whole I think it &s;hould be &s;ettled without further lo&s;s of time, and wi&s;h the earlie&s;t attention of Congre&s;s to be had to it.</P>
<P>Our delicate and truly critical &s;ituation, for want of a &s;uffi|cient force to oppo&s;e the enemy who are now ready, and, be|fore many days elap&s;e, will take the field, induced me to ex|pect that the troops rai&s;ing in the &s;outhern &s;tates, and intended for this army, would march in companies or half companies as they were made up, without waiting for their regiments to be complete. Policy &s;trongly &s;ugge&s;ted the propriety of the mea|&s;ure, and I reque&s;ted it: but, to my great anxiety and &s;urpri&s;e, I am told that this line of conduct is totally neglected, though a great number of recruits are actually engaged. I mu&s;t en|treat Congre&s;s to interpo&s;e again with their mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing appli|cations,
<PB N="29" REF="031423_0325_0FEC5C66FAE83340">
and commands that this expedient may be adopted with|out a moment's delay. No injury can re&s;ult from it, becau&s;e a &s;ufficient number of proper officers can and mu&s;t be left, to re|cruit the corps to their full complement.</P>
<P>Nor will my fears re&s;pecting the &s;tate of our arms allow me to be &s;ilent on that head. Let the &s;tates be urged to &s;end their men equipped with them, and every other nece&s;&s;ary, if po&s;&s;ible. I know not what &s;upplies may be in &s;tore el&s;ewhere, or in the power of Congre&s;s: but they mu&s;t not depend upon their being furni&s;hed here with any, or but with very few:&mdash;no human prudence or precaution could &s;ecure but a &s;mall part of tho&s;e belonging to the public, and in the hands of the &s;oldiery, from being embezzled and carried off when their time of &s;ervice ex|pired; nor can the &s;ame abu&s;es be re&s;trained in the militia.</P>

<P>NO military operation of any con&s;equence has occurred &s;ince I had the honor of writing to you la&s;t, except that on &s;unday I received information that the enemy were advancing in a manner and in numbers &s;o much greater than u&s;ual, that it looked like a prelude to an attack upon our po&s;ts, which were immediately put in the be&s;t preparation to receive them. It turned out to be only a &s;tronger foraging party than u&s;ual. They were however oppo&s;ed in &s;o &s;pirited a manner by our ad|vanced parties, that they were checked, and retired in the af|ternoon towards Amboy, from whence they came. Their lo&s;s in the cour&s;e of the day from the be&s;t accounts I can get, a|mounts to about one hundred in killed, wounded, pri&s;oners, and de&s;erters. Some people who were near the &s;cene of action, and who have picked up accounts from tho&s;e who have &s;ince been in Amboy, are &s;anguine enough to &s;uppo&s;e that they lo&s;t five hundred altogether: but of this I have no conception.&mdash;Our lo&s;s was only two killed and ten wounded.</P>
<P>I was in hopes, that, by the time the militia who are now in &s;ervice would be di&s;charged, we &s;hould have a con&s;iderable number of the new levies in the field: but, though I have re|ports from all quarters of the great &s;ucce&s;s of recruiting, I cannot get a man of them into &s;ervice. General John&s;on's mi|litia all go the fifth of March (many are gone already), and general Lincoln's on the fifteenth. The&s;e two bodies form &s;o con&s;iderable a part of our force, that, unle&s;s they are replaced
<PB N="30" REF="031423_0326_0FEC5C6DECC85330">
I &s;hall be left in a manner de&s;titute: for I have no great hopes of &s;eeing an equal number of continental troops by that time.</P>
<P>I have wrote to Penn&s;ylvania, to endeavor to get a reinforce|ment of militia from thence; and I am told the militia from the counties of Baltimore, Hartford, and Cecil, in Maryland, are on their march: but as I have it not from any authority, I know not when to expect them, or in what numbers. They are about pa&s;&s;ing a militia-law in this &s;tate, which may perhaps have &s;ome effect: but at pre&s;ent they are under no regulation at all.</P>
<P>I have in my late letters recommended &s;everal things to your con&s;ideration, particularly that of a promotion of general offi|cers. The very well-being of the new army depends upon its being done &s;peedily. Not only this, but we are now &s;uffering for want of brigadiers. General Scuyler has wrote mo&s;t pre&s;&s;|ingly for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of general officers; and I have none to &s;end him without injuring the &s;ervice in this quarter.&mdash;The ho&s;|pital plan too requires an an&s;wer, as nothing can be done in the nomination of the proper officers till I have your determination. There are &s;everal other matters of con&s;equence before you, to which I am waiting your an&s;wers before I can proceed upon the re&s;pective points to which they refer.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed you have a letter from the widow of a brave officer, who was killed at Princeton. If any provi&s;ion is made, I do not recollect what it is: if there is any, plea&s;e to inform me: if there is not, I can venture to recommend her as a proper ob|ject, to make &s;ome reparation for her great lo&s;s.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS this evening honored with your favor of the twenty-third ultimo, accompanied by &s;undry proceedings of Congre&s;s. Tho&s;e re&s;pecting general Lee, and which pre&s;cribe
<PB N="31" REF="031423_0327_0FEC5C7504604CE0">
the treatment of lieutenant-colonel Campbell and the five He&s;|&s;ian field-officers, are the cau&s;e of this letter.</P>
<P>Though I &s;incerely commi&s;erate the misfortunes of general Lee, and feel much for his pre&s;ent unhappy &s;ituation, yet, with all po&s;&s;ible deference to the opinion of Congre&s;s, I fear that the&s;e re&s;olutions would not have the de&s;ired effect,&mdash;are found|ed in impolicy,&mdash;and will, if adhered to, produce con&s;equences of an exten&s;ive and melancholy nature, Retaliation is certain|ly ju&s;t, and &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary, even where attended with the &s;evere&s;t penalties: but, when the evils which may and mu&s;t re|&s;ult from it exceed tho&s;e intended to be redre&s;&s;ed, prudence and policy require that it &s;hould be avoided.&mdash;Having premi&s;ed thus much, I beg leave to examine the ju&s;tice and expediency of it in the in&s;tances now before us.</P>
<P>From the be&s;t information I have been able to obtain, gene|ral Lee's u&s;age has not been &s;o di&s;graceful and di&s;honorable as to authori&s;e the treatment decreed to tho&s;e gentlemen, was it not prohibited by many other important con&s;iderations. His confinement, I believe, has been more rigorous than has been generally experienced by the re&s;t of our officers, or tho&s;e of the enemy who have been in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: but if the reports be true (received on that head), he has been provided with a de|cent apartment and with mo&s;t things nece&s;&s;ary to render him comfortable. This is not the ca&s;e with one of the officers com|prehended in the re&s;olves, if his letter, of which a copy is tran&s;|mitted, de&s;erves your credit. Here retaliation &s;eems to have been prematurely begun; or, to &s;peak with more propriety, &s;e|verities have been and are exerci&s;ed towards colonel Campbell, not ju&s;tified by any that general Lee has yet received.</P>
<P>In point of policy, under the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of our affairs, this doctrine cannot be &s;upported. The balance of pri&s;oners is greatly again&s;t us; and a general regard to the happine&s;s of the whole &s;hould mark our conduct. Can we imagine that our e|nemies will not mete the &s;ame puni&s;hments, the &s;ame indigni|ties, the &s;ame cruelties, to tho&s;e belonging to us, in their po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, that we impo&s;e on theirs in our power? Why &s;hould we &s;uppo&s;e them to po&s;&s;e&s;s more humanity than we have our|&s;elves? or why &s;hould an ineffectual attempt to relieve the di&s;|tre&s;&s;es of one brave unfortunate man involve many more in the &s;ame calamities?</P>
<P>However di&s;agreeable the fact may be, the enemy at this time have in their power, and &s;ubject to their call, near three hundred officers belonging to the army of the United States. In this number, there are &s;ome of high rank; and mo&s;t of them

are men of bravery and merit. The quota of theirs in our hands bears no proportion, being not more than fifty at mo&s;t. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, we &s;hould certainly do no act to draw upon the gentlemen belonging to us, and who have alrea|dy &s;uffered a long captivity, greater puni&s;hments than they have and now experience. If we &s;hould, what will their feelings be, and tho&s;e of their numerous and exten&s;ive connexions?&mdash;Suppo&s;e the treatment pre&s;cribed for the He&s;&s;ians &s;hould be pur&s;ued, will it not e&s;tabli&s;h what the enemy have been aiming to effect by every artifice and the gro&s;&s;e&s;t mi&s;repre&s;entations,&mdash;I mean, an opinion of our enmity towards them, and the cruel conduct they experience when they fall into our hands,&mdash;a pre|judice which we on our part have heretofore thought it politic to &s;uppre&s;s and to root out by every act of lenity and of kind|ne&s;s? It certainly will:&mdash;the He&s;&s;ians would hear of the puni&s;h|ment with all the circum&s;tances of heightened exaggeration,&mdash;would feel the injury, without inve&s;tigating the cau&s;e, or rea|&s;oning upon the ju&s;tice or nece&s;&s;ity of it. The mi&s;chiefs, which may and mu&s;t inevitably flow from the execution of the re|&s;olves, appear to be endle&s;s and innumerable.</P>
<P>On my own part, I have been much embarra&s;&s;ed on the &s;ub|ject of exchanges already. Applications are daily made by both friends and enemies, to complete them as far as circum|&s;tances of number and rank will apply. Some of the former have complained that a di&s;crimination is about to be adopted, perhaps injurious to their reputation, and certainly depriving them of their right of exchange in due cour&s;e, as e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the principles of equality propo&s;ed la&s;t year, acceded to by both parties, and now &s;ub&s;i&s;ting. The latter charge me with a breech of faith, and call upon me to perform the agree|ment.</P>
<P>Many more objections might be &s;ubjoined, were they mate|rial:&mdash;I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that the pre&s;ent &s;tate of our army (if it de&s;erves that name) will not authori&s;e the language of re|taliation or the &s;tyle of menace. This will be conceded by all who know that the whole of our force is weak and trifling, and compo&s;ed of militia (a very few regular troops excepted) who&s;e &s;ervice is on the eve of expiring.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal other matters which might be mentioned upon this &s;ubject, would time and opportunity permit: but, as they will not, I beg leave to refer you to colonel Walker, who will deliver this, and give &s;atisfaction to any enquiries that may be deemed nece&s;&s;ary.

<P>I do my&s;elf the honor to tran&s;mit you the inclo&s;ed copy of a letter from general Lee, received by a flag on Tue&s;day la&s;t. You will perceive from thence his wi&s;hes and expectations of &s;eeing &s;ome members of Congre&s;s in con&s;equence of his letter upon that &s;ubject. None of the pa&s;&s;ports which he mentions were &s;ent out, though the letter came by general Howe's per|mi&s;&s;ion as the others did. I &s;hould be happy to relieve his anxiety as far as I could, by &s;ending in major Morris: but this I cannot do till a &s;afe conduct is granted.</P>
<P>The more I con&s;ider the re&s;olves re&s;pecting lieutenant colo|nel Campbell and the He&s;&s;ian officers, the more convinced I am of their impolicy. The propo&s;ition made by Congre&s;s for the exchange of pri&s;oners, and which by their direction was tran&s;|mitted to general Howe, was founded on principles of equality in number and in rank. From hence no demand, as a matter of right, can be made of general Lee's relea&s;ement for any officer or number of officers of inferior rank: whatever is or might be done in &s;uch in&s;tance, would be of favor and indulgence. The only cartel that now &s;ub&s;i&s;ts is the one I have mentioned. This, &s;o far as it goes, is a beneficial one: it recogni&s;es the rank of our officers, and in&s;ures their di&s;charge from captivity whenever we are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a like number belonging to them, and of the &s;ame rank. If on our part it &s;hould be violated,&mdash;if it is not ob&s;erved,&mdash;&s;urely it will and mu&s;t cea&s;e to be obligatory on ge|neral Howe. What con&s;equences may then en&s;ue, I leave to your conjecture.</P>
<P>If it be objected that the above ob&s;ervations, and what I &s;aid in my former letter, prove that no treatment received by our officers &s;hould be retaliated on theirs,&mdash;my an&s;wer is, that the proportion of officers in their hands is at lea&s;t &s;ix to one in ours. This con&s;ideration, &s;uppo&s;ing we had a right to de|mand general Lee's liberty, would be of great weight, and &s;uf|ficient to prevent, in my opinion, the execution of the re&s;olves.&mdash;I have the honor to be, in ha&s;te, your mo&s;t obedient &s;er|vant.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS honored &s;everal days ago with your letter of the twenty-fifth ultimo, with its inclo&s;ures, the receipt of which was omitted to be acknowledged in my la&s;t.</P>
<P>Could I accompli&s;h the important objects &s;o eagerly wi&s;hed by Congre&s;s,&mdash;"confining the enemy within their pre&s;ent quar|ters,&mdash;preventing their getting &s;upplies from the country, and totally &s;ubduing them before they are reinforced,"&mdash;I &s;hould be happy indeed. But what pro&s;pect or hope can there be of my effecting &s;o de&s;irable a work at this time? The inclo&s;ed return, to which I &s;olicit the mo&s;t &s;erious attention of Congre&s;s, comprehends the whole force I have in Jer&s;ey. It is but a handful, and bears no proportion, on the &s;cale of numbers, to that of the enemy. Added to this, the major part is made up of militia. The mo&s;t &s;anguine in &s;peculation cannot deem it more than adequate to the lea&s;t valuable purpo&s;es of war.</P>
<P>The reinforcements mentioned to be drawn from general Heath were merely ideal,&mdash;nearly the whole of the ea&s;tern troops which were with him being here before. They were only engaged till to-day: and to-day they leave the camp. Their &s;ervice has been of pretty long continuance, and almo&s;t the whole of the winter months. What pro&s;pect there may be of immediate &s;uccours from other quarters, I know not: but from the militia of this &s;tate I cannot expect to derive much more aid. Tho&s;e who are well effected have been &s;o frequently cal|led from their home, that they are tired out, and almo&s;t profe&s;s an abhorrence of the &s;ervice: nor have I heard as yet that any continental troops are on the way. I have wrote to the briga|diers-general in mo&s;t of the &s;tates upon the &s;ubject, and al&s;o to the colonels, urging them by every motive to exert them&s;elves in filling the regiments and to forward them on.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, &s;ir, I feel the mo&s;t painful anxiety when I reflect on our &s;ituation and that of the enemy. Unle&s;s the levies ar|rive &s;oon, we mu&s;t, before it be long, experience &s;ome intere&s;t|ing and melancholy event. I believe the enemy have fixed their object, and the execution will &s;urely be attempted as &s;oon as the roads are pa&s;&s;able. The unprepared &s;tate in which we are, favors all their de&s;igns; and it is much to be wi&s;hed that they may not &s;ucceed to their warme&s;t expectations.</P>
<P>On recurring to the late promotions of brigadiers, I find the number appointed to be &s;hort of what I took the liberty to re|commend, and not competent to the exigencies of the &s;ervice &s;uppo&s;ing the whole in office before, and tho&s;e lately created,
<PB N="35" REF="031423_0331_0FEC5C7B88257AD0">
on&s;ent to act, which I have rea&s;on to believe will not be the ca&s;e. I &s;hall only beg leave to refer you to my former letters upon this &s;ubject, and to a&s;&s;ure you that many di&s;advantages will re&s;ult from not having a &s;ufficient number of officers of this rank. We have always been deficient in this in&s;tance; and certain I am that the &s;ervice is greatly injured by it. The proportion I mentioned was full &s;mall, and, in my opinion, &s;hould not be di&s;pen&s;ed with.</P>
<P>I would al&s;o take the liberty of mentioning again (having received no an&s;wer upon the &s;ubject) that &s;ettling the ho&s;pital plan and e&s;tabli&s;hment becomes more and more nece&s;&s;ary. It is an object of infinite importance; and the difficulties of doing it on a proper foundation will be great, if not almo&s;t in&s;ur|mountable, &s;hould it be deferred till the campaign opens, and the enemy begin their operations. The benefits of the in&s;titu|tion will &s;oon be known:&mdash;the want was &s;everely felt in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t year.</P>
<P>There is one thing more which claims, in my opinion, the earlie&s;t attention of Congre&s;s,&mdash;I mean the pay of the regimen|tal &s;urgeons, and that of the mates. The&s;e appointments are &s;o e&s;&s;ential, that they cannot be done without. The pay, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, is &s;o low, &s;o inadequate to the &s;ervices which &s;hould be performed, that no man &s;u&s;taining the character of a gentlemen, and who has the lea&s;t medical abilities or &s;kill in the profe&s;&s;ion, can think of accepting it: that in the latter is &s;o paltry and trifling, that none, of the lea&s;t genero&s;ity of &s;enti|ment or pretentions to merit, can con&s;ent to act for it. In a word, the&s;e are inconveniencies of an intere&s;ting nature:&mdash;they amount to an exclu&s;ion of per&s;ons who could di&s;charge the du|ties of tho&s;e offices; and, if not redre&s;&s;ed, there is not the &s;malle&s;t probability that any can be prevailed on to enter them again.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal matters al&s;o which I refered to Congre&s;s &s;ome time &s;ince, and upon which I have not received the re&s;ult of their diliberations.&mdash;one enquiry, about the &s;tate of arms and ammunition, I am peculiarly anxious to be &s;atisfied in.</P>
<P>From the inconveniences and injuries to the &s;ervice of late for want of money, I am induced to reque&s;t that the &s;tricte&s;t regard &s;hould be had to furni&s;hing the payma&s;ter with con&s;tant and &s;ufficient &s;upplies. On &s;unday he received five hundred thou&s;and dollars, half of which is already expended, and the balance in a day or two will be entirely &s;wept away, without di&s;charging the &s;everal claims. By his report, the commi&s;&s;ary here requires an immediate draught for a hundred thou&s;and;
<PB N="36" REF="031423_0332_0FEC5C7DA3EF18C0">
and the militia returning and about to leave camp, a hundred and twenty thou&s;and&mdash;more. The expen&s;e incurred by calling on them &s;o frequently is almo&s;t incredible. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are &s;everal arrears due to the old troops, and to mo&s;t of the general and &s;taff officers.</P>

<P>I fully intended to tran&s;mit you a general return, but am not able to make it out with preci&s;ion.

<P>THE difficulty if not impo&s;&s;ibility of giving Congre&s;s a ju&s;t idea of our &s;ituation (and of &s;everal other important matters requiring their earlie&s;t attention) by letter, has induced me to prevail on major-general Greene to wait upon them for that purpo&s;e.

I &s;hall only &s;ay, from the rank he holds as an able and good officer in the e&s;timation of all who knew him, he de&s;erves the greate&s;t re&s;pect; and much regard is due to his opinions in the line of his profe&s;&s;ion. He has upon his mind &s;uch matters as appear to me mo&s;t material to be immedi|ately con&s;idered of; and many more will probably ari&s;e during the intercour&s;e you may think proper to honor him with;&mdash;on all which I wi&s;h to have the &s;en&s;e of Congre&s;s, and the relult of &s;uch a deliberation as may be formed thereupon.</P>
<P>I have enclo&s;ed an extract of a letter received ye&s;terday from governor Trumbull, with a copy of one intercepted, going from the late governor Wentworth to his &s;i&s;ter. The information contained in the letter, if true, is important and intere&s;ting: how far it is to be relied on, I cannot determine: but there can be no doubt of the Briti&s;h court's &s;training every nerve and intere&s;t at home and abroad, to bend us to their * * * yoke.</P>

<P>COLONEL Palfrey, having expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to &s;ettle the accounts of his office to this time, has obtained my per|mi&s;&s;ion to repair to Philadelphia, and now waits on Congre&s;s with his books and vouchers, hoping that a committee will be appointed to examine and adju&s;t the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The di&s;advantages which have ari&s;en to the &s;ervice, and which have been &s;everely felt, for want of con&s;tant &s;upplies in the military che&s;t, are almo&s;t incredible, and are not to be de|&s;cribed but with great difficulty to tho&s;e who are not imme|diately in the army, and privy to the frequent and importunate applications that are made. To prevent inconveniencies of the like nature in future, I have thought it proper that an e&s;timate of the monthly advances &s;hould be formed and laid before Con|gre&s;s. This colonel Palfrey will do; and, though it cannot be effected with a degree of &s;crupulous exactne&s;s and preci&s;ion, yet from his intimate knowledge of the incidental charges and expen&s;es in the common cour&s;e of things, the calculation, I apprehend, will be attended with many benefits.

<P>YESTERDAY a letter, of which the inclo&s;ed is a copy, came to my hands. The account is confirmed by a countryman who is &s;ince come in: but nothing di&s;tinct has yet been re|ceived.</P>
<P><PB REF="031423_0334_0FEC5C8464AFA5B8">
The aid required of me in colonel Hay's letter cannot be given: I have no men to oppo&s;e the ennemy's de&s;igns in any one quarter, although called upon from every quarter. All that was po&s;&s;ible for me to do towards collecting a force at Peek&s;kill, I had attempted before:&mdash;I had in peremptory terms called upon the officers of Rhode-I&s;land and Connecticut to forward on their recruits under proper officers as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;i|ble to that place: I had directed &s;uch of the New-York regi|ments as had been ordered to Ticonderoga, to repair thither: I had reque&s;ted eight of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts regiments to be march|ed to that po&s;t: and, le&s;t the&s;e &s;hould not arrive in time, I urg|ed governor Trumbull, in a letter of the &s;ixth in&s;tant, to &s;end two thou&s;and of his militia to the &s;ame place. But &s;orry I am to ob&s;erve, the militia have got tired; and the colonels of the continental regiments have been greatly deceived them&s;elves,&mdash;have greatly deceived me,&mdash;or the mo&s;t unheard-of de&s;ertions * * * have prevailed * * *: for regiments, reported two or three months ago to be half completed, are, upon the colonels being called upon in po&s;itive terms for a ju&s;t &s;tate of them, found to contain le&s;s than one hundred men; and this not the ca&s;e of a &s;ingle regiment only, but of many. In Connecticut alone, by a letter from general Par&s;ons, of the &s;ixth in&s;tant, four regiments are mentioned as not having more than eighty rank and file, each.</P>
<P>The&s;e, &s;ir, are melancholy truths: but facts they are, and ne|ce&s;&s;ary to be known to Congre&s;s, however prudent it may be to conceal them from the ob&s;ervation of others.</P>
<P>To &s;uperintend the bu&s;ine&s;s of recruiting,&mdash;to &s;ee that the officers were diligent,&mdash;to prevent impo&s;itions if po&s;&s;ible,&mdash;to appoint fit places of rendezvous,&mdash;to &s;ee that the recruits were actually brought to tho&s;e places, and there equipped and train|ed for the field,&mdash;were among the great objects which early and repeatedly induced me to pre&s;s the appointment of general officers: but unfortunately the delay of appointing, being fol|lowed by the re&s;ignation of &s;ome officers and non-acceptance of others, will involve the army in a mere chaos of confu&s;ion at a time when the utmo&s;t order and regularity &s;hould prevail, and when all our arrangements ought to be completely e&s;tabli&s;hed. The medical department will, it is much to be &s;eared, be in the &s;ame &s;ituation:&mdash;not an officer yet appointed to it.</P>
<P>For want of proper and coercive powers,&mdash;from di&s;affection and other cau&s;es,&mdash;the militia of this &s;tate are not to be depend|ed upon. They are drawn out with difficulty, and at a mo&s;t enormous expen&s;e, as their accounts will &s;hew: they come, you

can &s;carce tell how; they go, you hardly know when. In the &s;ame predicament are tho&s;e of Penn&s;ylvania.</P>
<P>Numbers from this &s;tate have joined the enemy; and many more are di&s;po&s;ed to do &s;o, as the letter from Mr. Hoff (a copy of which is inclo&s;ed, corre&s;ponding with &s;everal others of the &s;ame tenor) &s;ufficiently evinces.</P>

<P>I LAST night had the honor to receive your leter of the twenty-&s;ixth in&s;tant, accompanied by &s;undry re&s;olves of Con|gre&s;s, and &s;ome other papers.</P>
<P>The arrival of the arms, locks, and flints, you have been plea&s;ed to mention, is a mo&s;t fortunate and happy event. I join you mo&s;t &s;incerely in congratulations upon the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I have not yet obtained a certain account of the expedition again&s;t and de&s;truction or Peek&s;kill. Information of tho&s;e e|vents has not been yet tran&s;mitted by generals M'Dougal or Clinton, or the convention of the &s;tate. There is no doubt but that the town is de&s;troyed, and, with it, &s;ome &s;tores:&mdash;neither the quality nor amount of them is known. It is &s;aid that it was done in part by our own people when they found that they could not prevent them falling into the enemy's hands.&mdash;The &s;hips and troops have gone down the river again.</P>
<P>Mr. Kirkland, the Oneida mi&s;&s;ionary, arrived here this week with a chief warrior and five other Indians of that nation. They had been to Bo&s;ton, and came from thence to this place to inquire into the true &s;tate of matters, that they might report them to a grand council to be &s;hortly held. They &s;aid things were &s;o fal&s;ely and variou&s;ly repre&s;ented by our enemies through their agents, that they did not know what to depend on. I in|vited them to go to Philadelphia: but they declined it, decla|ring they were well &s;atisfied with what they had &s;een, and that
<PB N="40" REF="031423_0336_0FEC5C90DC0DAFB8">
they were authori&s;ed to tell their nation, all they had heard from the enemy was fal&s;e. Being told that France was a&s;&s;i&s;ting us, and about to join in the war, they &s;eemed highly plea&s;ed; and Mr. Kirkland &s;aid he was per&s;uaded it would have a con&s;i|derable effect on the minds of &s;everal of the nations, and &s;ecure to us their neutrality, if not a declaration and commencement of ho&s;tilities in our favor. I &s;hewed them every civility in my power, and every thing that I thought material to excite in them an idea of our &s;trength and independence. After &s;taying two days, they &s;et off for their nation expre&s;&s;ing their de&s;ire of the mo&s;t &s;peedy return to the council, and profe&s;&s;ing the mo&s;t friendly &s;entiments towards us.</P>

<P>CAPTAIN De&s;hields, of Mr. Buchanan's &s;hip from Bal|temore, who was taken by the enemy and carried into York, made his e&s;cape from thence on &s;aturday evening. He informs that three thou&s;and troops Briti&s;h and He&s;&s;ian, embarked about ten days ago from the city and Staten-I&s;land, on board tran&s;|ports which were lying at the latter when he came away. He adds that the enemy have built and are building a number of light flat bottomed boats, about &s;eventy of which are fini&s;hed.</P>

Captain De&s;hields &s;ays it &s;eemed to be the general opinion and conver&s;ation that this embarkation was for Che&s;apeak-bay, with a view of making a de&s;cent on the Ea&s;tern-Shore, or that the troops were to proceed to the Head of Elk, taking Anna|polis and Baltimore in their way. There were &s;ome who thought it probable they mean to go up the North-river and attempt the Highland fortifications.&mdash;I have written to generals M'Dougal and Clinton, de&s;iring them to make the be&s;t preparation that circum&s;tances will admit of, for their reception, in ca&s;e the latter &s;hould be their object.</P>

<P>SINCE I had the honor of writing to you la&s;t, I have received the inclo&s;ed from general M'Dougal, which contains a full account of the late affair at Peek&s;kill. Every pruden|tial &s;tep appears to have been taken by the general, and as good a di&s;po&s;ition made as his &s;mall number of men would ad|mit of.</P>
<P>I have heard nothing further re&s;pecting the embarkation of troops which I mentioned in my la&s;t.&mdash;I am in hopes the Con|necticut militia will arrive at Peek&s;kill before another expedi|tion is made up the North-river. I have wrote to ha&s;ten them as much as po&s;&s;ible, le&s;t &s;uch another de&s;ign &s;hould be really in agitation.&mdash;In my opinion, Delaware bay is their object, and Che&s;apeak only thrown out by way of blind: their late attempt to procure Delaware pilots &s;eems to confirm it.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve by your late promotions that a foreign gentleman is appointed to the command of the German batallion.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM honored with yours of the fourth, inclo&s;ing &s;un|dry re&s;olves of Congre&s;s from the twenty-ninth of March to the fifth in&s;tant.&mdash;I am extremely glad to &s;ee the re&s;olve for the immediate removal of military &s;tores from Baltimore and Annapolis; for, although I do not imagine that the enemy in|tend an expedition of any great con&s;equence in Che&s;apeak-bay yet while the &s;tores lay at the above-mentioned places, they were always &s;ubject to be de&s;troyed by a &s;udden attack of a &s;hip of war with a few land forces.</P>
<P>The regulations for the payma&s;ter-general's department are very &s;alutary, and, if carried &s;trictly into execution, will make a va&s;t &s;aving to the public. It may be ea&s;ily done when the army is put upon a regular footing: but, while we are obliged to make u&s;e of militia, we mu&s;t &s;ubmit to all the irregularities that naturally attend them, and mu&s;t not therefore expect to have the rule as &s;crupulou&s;ly complied with by them as could be wi&s;hed. * * *</P>
<P>The mu&s;ter-ma&s;ter-general complained that the duty required of him was more than he could perform: but by the late re|&s;olves there is an ample allowance for deputies; and therefore no further excu&s;e can be made upon that head.</P>
<P>I mo&s;t ardently wi&s;h to &s;ee the ho&s;pital e&s;tabli&s;hed. I am afraid too much time has been lo&s;t in the con&s;ideration of the plan: but the gentlemen who &s;hall be appointed to the &s;uperin|tendence mu&s;t endeavor to make up for lo&s;t time by their dili|gence.</P>
<P>By the late&s;t accounts from Brun&s;wic, it looks as if the enemy were projecting an embarkation. They have been &s;trip|ping the buildings of boards, and cutting &s;mall timber, and tran&s;porting them from Brun&s;wic to Amboy. It is imagined this is to build births in their tran&s;ports.&mdash;I &s;hall keep a con|&s;tant look-out upon the motions of the ve&s;&s;els, and &s;hall en|deavor to obtain every intelligence by &s;ending people into their quarters.&mdash;I think Delaware-bay mu&s;t be their de&s;tination if they move by water.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS ju&s;t now honored with your letter of the ninth in&s;tant, covering &s;undry re&s;olutions of Congre&s;s. Tho&s;e for regulating the ho&s;pital and medical department, I tru&s;t, will prove of the mo&s;t &s;alutary con&s;equences. It is only to be re|gretted that this nece&s;&s;ary and liberal in&s;titution had not been gone into and completed at an earlier period.</P>
<P>The honors Congre&s;s have decreed to the memory of gene|rals Warren and Mercer, afford me the highe&s;t plea&s;ure: their character and merit had a ju&s;t claim to every mark on re&s;pect; and I heartily wi&s;h that every officer of the United States, emulating their virtues, may by their actions &s;ecure to them|&s;elves the &s;ame right to the grateful tributes of their country.</P>
<P>Since writing to you ye&s;terday I have received further in|telligence of the enemy's preparations in York, indicating a movement before long. It is contained in the inclo&s;ed letter, No. 1, and corroborates the opinion I have long entertained that they would make a pu&s;h again&s;t Philadelphia. The tory regiments mentioned, we are told, are at Hackin&s;ac, and are about five hundred &s;trong, exclu&s;ive of a company of High|landers which is with them.</P>
<P>The inclo&s;ed letter from le chevalier count De Vrecourt came to hand this morning,&mdash;which I have thought proper to tran&s;mit to Congre&s;s, that they may con&s;ider his ca&s;e, and adopt &s;uch mea&s;ures re&s;pecting him as his character and te&s;ti|monials de&s;erve. I never heard of him before: but if he is a &s;kilful engineer, he will be extremely u&s;eful, and &s;hould be employed, though he may not under&s;tand our language. At this time we have not one with the army, nor one to join it, of the lea&s;t reputation or preten&s;ions to &s;kill. If this gentle|man came in con&s;equence of an agreement with doctor Frank|lin, and brought credentials from him, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e him to be acquainted with what he was recommended for.</P>
<P>The cartel, propo&s;ed to be &s;ettled, and &s;o long in agitation, is not accompli&s;hed yet: the la&s;t meeting on that bu&s;ine&s;s was the &s;econd in&s;tant, when nothing was done; nor is a further interview appointed re&s;pecting it. I have tran&s;mitted a copy of lord Cornwallis's letter which came out the next day, with that of the paper alluded to by him, which Mr. Harri&s;on re|fu&s;ed to receive from colonel Walcot, and of my an&s;wer to the latter in a letter to general Howe. The objections or ar|ticles mentioned by colonel Walcot were tho&s;e general Greene had with him, and which he left when he came from Philadel|phia:
<PB N="44" REF="031423_0340_0FEC5C9859131528">
the original I have by me. Tho&s;e points were in&s;i&s;ted on again, and rejected, and a tender made of the paper by co|lonel Walcot, which he brought with him prepared.</P>
<P>I have appointed John Wilkins, John Steel, Mathew Ir|vin, and Samuel Ker&s;ley, e&s;quires, captains of companies to be rai&s;ed by them, in con&s;equence of the recommendation of general Arm&s;trong. As the intere&s;t of tho&s;e gentlemen lies in Penn&s;ylvania chiefly, and it would be drawing money from the payma&s;ter here to carry to Philadelphia (&s;uppo&s;ing there was a &s;upply in the che&s;t, which is not the ca&s;e), I &s;hall be obliged by Congre&s;s's ordering &s;ix hundred dollars to be ad|vanced to each of them on account of the recruiting &s;ervice; the fir&s;t of whom I imagine is in Philadelphia. If this requi|&s;ition can be complied with, he, I pre&s;ume, will give notice to the re&s;t; or, if general Arm&s;trong is informed of it, he will do it.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM honored with yours of the tenth, accompanied with one from the committee of Congre&s;s to whom I have wrote very fully upon the &s;ubject of the re&s;olve for forming an army upon the we&s;t &s;ide of Delaware, and to which I refer you.&mdash;I wi&s;h I could &s;ee any pro&s;pect of an army, fit to make pro|per oppo&s;ition, formed any where. You will perhaps be &s;ur|pri&s;ed at this after the public reports of the great &s;ucce&s;s of recruiting in all the &s;tates; but, to convince you that the&s;e are but bare reports, I will give you the be&s;t information I have been able to collect from actual returns and other accounts.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="031423_0341_0FEC5C9B05874498">
New-Hamp&s;hire.&mdash;No returns: but a letter from general Heath &s;ays they are tolerably forward.&mdash;All their regiments go to the northward.</P>
<P>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts.&mdash;About four hundred men rai&s;ed to a regi|ment; many of the&s;e yet to undergo inoculation. Seven of their regiments go to the northward, and eight are to come to Peek&s;kill for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Rhode-I&s;land.&mdash;Only three hundred and &s;ixty men enli&s;ted in both regiments the fir&s;t of April. Two hundred of the&s;e are yet to be inocualted.&mdash;General Varnum writes me that he de&s;|pairs of filling up the regiments.</P>
<P>Connecticut.&mdash;By a return from general Par&s;ons, of the fourth of April, about eighteen hundred men were recruited through the whole &s;tate,&mdash;they, much di&s;per&s;ed;&mdash;many to have the &s;mall-pox; and recruiting at a &s;tand.</P>
<P>New-York.&mdash;About two hundred men to a regiment: and, from the peculiar &s;ituation of that province, it will be almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for them to fill up their regiments though they exert them&s;elves very much.</P>
<P>New-Jer&s;ew.&mdash;Between two and three hundred to a regi|ment. They al&s;o lie under many difficulties on account of the di&s;affection of their &s;tate: but their officers are active and dili|gent.</P>
<P>Penn&s;ylvania.&mdash;Mo&s;t of her regiments are very backward,&mdash;tho&s;e mo&s;t &s;o, who have been longe&s;t recruiting.</P>
<P>Delaware &s;tate.&mdash;No return of their regiment.</P>
<P>Maryland.&mdash;I have only the return of one regiment, which con&s;i&s;ts of two hundred men: but I do not believe the others are in more forwardne&s;s. The di&s;putes about the rank of offi|cers have prevailed &s;o much, that the recruiting &s;ervice has been in a manner neglected.</P>
<P>Virginia.&mdash;The nine old regiments will not exceed eighteen hundred effective men: and governor Henry, in a letter which I received ye&s;terday, informs me that he did not think that more than four of the &s;ix new ones would be filled. He pro|po&s;es the expediency of rai&s;ing volunteer companies to &s;erve &s;e|ven or eight months, to make up the deficiency: but this I &s;hall object to on many accounts, particularly that it would be introducing a body of men who would look upon them&s;elves at liberty to do what they plea&s;ed, and, the moment their time expired would leave us, though at the mo&s;t critical juncture.</P>
<P>If the men that are rai&s;ed, few as they are, could be got into the field, it would be a matter of &s;ome con&s;olation: but eve|ry method that I have been able to devi&s;e has proved ineffec|tual.
<PB N="46" REF="031423_0342_0FEC5C9F87854718">
If I &s;end an officer to collect the &s;ick and &s;cattered of his regiment, it is ten to one but he neglects his duty, goes home on plea&s;ure or bu&s;ine&s;s, and the next that I hear of him is that he has re&s;igned:&mdash;furloughs are not more attended to than if there was no limitation of time:&mdash;and in &s;hort, &s;ir, there is &s;uch a total depre&s;&s;ion of that military ardor which I hoped would have in&s;pired every officer when he found his pay genteelly augmented and the army put upon a re&s;pectable footing, that it &s;eems to me as if all public &s;pirit was &s;unk * * *</P>
<P>I &s;hall as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible tran&s;mit to the board of war a li&s;t of the appointments I have made in con&s;equence of the powers ve&s;ted in me.</P>
<P>If the appointments in the ho&s;pital are not filled up before the receipt of this, I would take the liberty of mentioning a gentleman whom I think highly de&s;erving of notice, not only on account of his abilities, but for the very great a&s;&s;i&s;tance which he has afforded in the cour&s;e of this winter, merely in the nature of a volunteer. The gentlemen is doctor John Co|chran, well known to all the faculty, and particularly to doc|tor Shippen, who, I &s;uppo&s;e, has mentioned him among the can|didates. The place for which the doctor is well fitted, and which will be mo&s;t agreeable to him, is &s;urgeon general to the middle department. In this line he &s;erved all the la&s;t war in the Briti&s;h &s;ervice, and has di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf this winter, particularly in his attention to the &s;mall-pox patients and the wounded, who, but for him and doctor Bond, mu&s;t have &s;uffer|ed much, if not been totally neglected, as there were no other medical gentlemen to be found.&mdash;If the appointment of &s;urgeon-general is filled up, that of deputy-director of the middle de|partment would be acceptable.</P>
<P>I have been thus full in my recommendation becau&s;e doctor Cochran in my manner had my promi&s;e of one of the capital appointments in the ho&s;pital, upon a pre&s;umption that I &s;hould have had &s;ome hand in the nomination by the re&s;olution of Congre&s;s empowering me to fill all commi&s;&s;ions under the rank of brigadiers-general.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 13.&mdash;I have this moment received a line from general Lincoln, informing me that the enemy attempted to &s;urpri&s;e him early this morning at his po&s;t at Boundbrook; but he made good his retreat to the pa&s;s of the mountains ju&s;t in his rear, with trifling lo&s;s.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE nothing of importance to tran&s;mit Congre&s;s, no event in the military line having happened &s;ince my la&s;t, except the &s;urpri&s;ing a &s;mall picquet guard of the enemy on monday night at Bonemtown, and bringing off thirteen pri&s;oners by one of our parties. An enterpri&s;e of a &s;imilar nature was for|med again&s;t that at Amboy, in which the party &s;ent to effect it did not &s;ucceed &s;o well, though the mo&s;t advanced of them &s;eized and &s;ecured three of their out-centuries without giving an alarm.</P>
<P>By a letter from general M'Dougal, of ye&s;terday, I am in|formed that he had received accounts of thirty-&s;ix &s;ail of tran&s;|ports having left Newport on friday la&s;t, with troops on board. Other reports he had were that a number of &s;hips were coming up the &s;ound, &s;o that we may rea&s;onably conclude general Howe is drawing his forces from the ea&s;tward. General Arnold, in a letter of the &s;ixth, mentioned, that, from the preparation of tran&s;ports, and other circum&s;tances, he thought it probable an embarkation was about to take place.</P>
<P>There are grounds to &s;u&s;pect from information received, that &s;ome unfair practices have been and are meant to be u&s;ed in certain exports from Philadelphia. It is &s;aid that a ve&s;&s;el navi|gated by Frenchmen loaded there, belong to * * * of New|York, which carried her cargo to general Howe; al&s;o that * * * and * * * of Monmouth-county intend to load one or more for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, under the idea of &s;ending them to foreign markets. I have written to the board of war for Penn|&s;ylvania upon the &s;ubject, and doubt not but the&s;e hints will be
<PB N="48" REF="031423_0344_0FEC5CB1B3944CC8">
properly improved, and &s;uch frauds guarded again&s;t as well as circum&s;tances will admit.</P>
<P>I have inclo&s;ed a copy of an adverti&s;ement publi&s;hed in Gaine's paper of the fourteenth, which &s;hews that no artifices are left untried by the enemy to injure us. Before the appear|ance of this unparralleled piece, I had heard that a per&s;on was gone from York to Rhode-I&s;land with a quantity of counterfeit money.</P>
<P>There is one thing which I beg leave to mention to Con|gre&s;s, and which I think highly de&s;erving their attention, that is, that &s;upplies of hard money, or bills of exchange to procure it, &s;hould, if po&s;&s;ible be &s;ent our pri&s;oners in the hands of the enemy, at lea&s;t to the officers, to relieve their wants. By let|ters which I have received from them of late, I find they are in great di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;uch as ought to be removed, if it can be done.&mdash;No inconvenience will re&s;ult to the public from &s;uch &s;upplies, if they can be furni&s;hed, as proper &s;toppages and de|ductions can be made from their pay.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 19.&mdash;I was honored with your letter of the &s;ixteenth between twelve and one o'clock ye&s;terday, accompanied by &s;undry re&s;olutions. I hope the mea&s;ures Congre&s;s have adopted will produce the &s;alutary con&s;equences they had in view: but I fear that the &s;tates, unle&s;s they are delicate in exerci&s;ing the powers they are inve&s;ted with for filling vacancies in in&s;tances of removal from office, and pay &s;trict attention to a proper line of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion where there are no capital objections, will renew much of that confu&s;ion and di&s;order we have been endeavoring to extricate our&s;elves from. Nor will this be of &s;mall difficulty if they di&s;place many officers: for, &s;uppo&s;ing them to have kept the mo&s;t accurate li&s;ts of their original appointments, changes have taken place in &s;everal in&s;tances from various cau&s;es un|known to them, and of which they cannot be appri&s;ed.</P>
<P>I can a&s;&s;ure Congre&s;s the appellation given to the regiments officered by me was without my con&s;ent or privity. As &s;oon as I heard it, I wrote to &s;everal of the officers in terms of &s;e|vere reprehen&s;ion, and expre&s;sly charged them to &s;uppre&s;s the di&s;tinction, adding that all the battalions were on the &s;ame foot|ing, and all under the general name of Continental.</P>
<P>An attack upon the king's troops of Rhode-I&s;land was cer|tainly a de&s;irable event, could it have been conducted with &s;uc|ce&s;s, or upon equal terms. It being an object of great moment, and involving in its i&s;&s;ue many important con&s;equences, I am led to believe the practicability of it has had much con&s;idera|tion, and the mea&s;ure was found to be unadvi&s;able under the
<PB N="49" REF="031423_0345_0FEC5CB39943D5A0">
circum&s;tances of the troops collected for the purpo&s;e. If the enemy have not evacuated the I&s;land, I &s;uppo&s;e the matter will be further weighed.</P>
<P>I do not find in the medical arrangement any mention of re|gimental &s;urgeons'-mates, or provi&s;ion made for their payment. Whether Congre&s;s mean to di&s;pen&s;e with &s;uch officers or not, I cannot tell: I have heard that they do: but they appear to me to be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. We are often obliged to divide re|giments and &s;end a part to a di&s;tant po&s;t: when this is the ca&s;e, it is e&s;&s;ential that there &s;hould be &s;ome per&s;on with them to take charge of the &s;ick or wounded, if &s;uch there &s;hould be.&mdash;I have only mentioned this of many rea&s;ons that might be urged to &s;hew the expediency of &s;uch appointments.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the many circum&s;tances inducing a belief that Philadelphia will be the fir&s;t object of the enemy's atten|tion,&mdash;yet, as the &s;tratagems of war are various, and they may be ea&s;ily changed, e&s;pecially when they have the entire com|mand of the water,&mdash;I cannot but con&s;ider the detention of the troops at Philadelphia, farther than mentioned in my letter in an&s;wer to that from the board of war, as expedient, and &s;ubject to great inconvenience and injury. In the pre&s;ent divided, &s;e|parted &s;tate of the army, we are weak at all points, and not able to make the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition promi&s;ing &s;ucce&s;s, Suppo&s;ing they were collected here, they would be ready to act as nece&s;&s;ity and circum&s;tances might require. If the enemy pu&s;hed for Phila|delphia, we &s;hould have notice of it, and could hang upon their flank and rear: nor is it likely they would undertake &s;uch an expedition without attempting the de&s;truction or di&s;per&s;ion of the army fir&s;t. If they embarked and &s;hould go to &s;ea, we &s;hould have information of it, and could be there in time.

Added to this, &s;everal of the rigiments, e&s;pecially tho&s;e which came fir&s;t from Virginia and Penn&s;ylvania, are &s;o broken that it is impo&s;&s;i|ble to do any thing with the parts that are here; and that &s;pi|rit which is always derived from a corps being full, or as much &s;o as circum&s;tances of number will admit of, is entirely done away.</P>

<P>I WAS this morning honored with your favor of the twen|tieth, inclo&s;ing &s;undry proceedings of Congre&s;s.&mdash;The removal of provi&s;ions, &amp;c. from the communication between Brun&s;wic and Trenton has been pretty well effected already. It was an object early attended to, and what I recommended to the a&s;|&s;embly of this &s;tate as de&s;erving their interpo&s;ition and aid: but finding that it had not their immediate con&s;ideration, and that they &s;eemed to decline interfering in the matter, I directed the quarter-ma&s;ter and commi&s;&s;aries to purcha&s;e their fir&s;t &s;upplies of tho&s;e nece&s;&s;aries from &s;uch places as appeared to be mo&s;t ex|po&s;ed to the enemy's incur&s;ions and through which it is mo&s;t probable they will take their route towards the Delaware, in ca&s;e an enterpri&s;e that way &s;hould be in contemplation. I have tran&s;mitted copies of the re&s;olve upon this &s;ubject to general Put|nam and colonel Forman (the latter of whom is in Monmouth|county), with orders to execute the &s;ame agreeable to the di|rections therein pre&s;cribed, where it may be nece&s;&s;ary on the road leading from South-Amboy acro&s;s the country.</P>
<P>I have nothing of importance to communicate to Congre&s;s. The advices they will receive to-day, which pa&s;&s;ed through this town ye&s;terday, will tell them that the enemy remained at Rhode-I&s;land on the fifteenth in&s;tant, notwith&s;tanding the ac|counts we had received of their embarkation before.</P>

<P>I WAS la&s;t night honored with your letter of the twenty|fifth, with &s;undry re&s;olves of Congre&s;s. Such of them as are nece&s;&s;ary for my government and conduct I &s;hall &s;trictly attend to.</P>
<P>The money and bill for our pri&s;oners had better be tran&s;mit|ted to Elias Boudinot, e&s;quire, to whom I &s;hall give directions to adopt ways and means for &s;ending the &s;ame, and for a proper appropriation and di&s;tribution of the money among&s;t them. Bills, I think will be mo&s;t eligible, provided they are duly paid. As to procuring clothes in New-York, I have rea&s;on to believe that it will not be allowed, and that the pri&s;oners will obtain no &s;upplies but what we &s;end them.</P>
<P>I heard of Mr. Franklin's practices &s;ome time ago, and ad|vi&s;ed governor Trumbull of the &s;ame, that his conduct might be properly attended to. It is very unhappy for us, that, through the intrigues of &s;uch men, the enemy have found means to rai&s;e a &s;pirit of di&s;affection but too generally in many of the &s;tates. In this, I have &s;trong a&s;&s;urances that it has ari&s;en to a great heigth; and I &s;hall not be di&s;appointed if a large number of the inhabitants in &s;ome of the counties &s;hould openly appear in arms as &s;oon as the enemy begin their operations. I have taken every mea&s;ure in my power to &s;uppre&s;s it; but neverthe|le&s;s &s;everal from Sussex and Bergan have joined their army, and the &s;pirit becomes more and more daring every day.</P>
<P>You will be plea&s;ed to direct general Mi&s;&s;lin to remain in Philadelphia as long as Congre&s;s &s;hall think his pre&s;ence there e&s;&s;ential.</P>
<P>I have inlco&s;ed a copy of general Howe's letter which I re|ceived la&s;t night in an&s;wer to mine of the ninth in&s;tant.</P>
<P>Nothing of an intere&s;ting nature has occurred &s;ince my la&s;t: which leaves me only to add, that I have the honor to be, with &s;entiments of the greate&s;t re&s;pect, &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I LAST night received the favor of your letter of the twenty-&s;ixth, with the re&s;olves to which it alludes.</P>
<P>The views of Congre&s;s, in &s;ending general officers to the ea&s;t|ward to ha&s;ten on the troops, have been long anti&s;cipated: ge|neral Poor is in New-Hamp&s;hire for the purpo&s;e,&mdash;general Heath in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, with the brigadiers, Nixon Glo|ver
<PB N="52" REF="031423_0348_0FEC5CBB67409968">
and Patter&s;on,&mdash;general Varnum in Rhode-I&s;land, and ge|neral Par&s;ons in Connecticut. Generals Spencer and Arnold too have been de&s;ired to attend to the bu&s;ine&s;s. To the&s;e gen|tlemen I have wrote repeatedly in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing terms upon the &s;ubject, and I have no rea&s;on to doubt but every exer|tion on their part has been employed to promote the end. The delay of tho&s;e who have enli&s;ted has ari&s;en from the late pe|riod when they engaged, and from their being inoculated &s;ince, which could not be di&s;pen&s;ed with, without &s;ubjecting them to the calamities and ravage of the &s;mall-pox in the natural way.</P>
<P>At three o'clock this morning I received a letter from gene|ral M'Dougal inclo&s;ing three from colonel Huntington, copies of the whole of which I have tran&s;mitted. By the&s;e, you will perceive the impre&s;&s;ion which a part of general Howe's army has made into Connecticut, and the pro&s;pect they had of de|&s;troying &s;uch of our &s;tores as were depo&s;ited in Danbury, which unfortunately were but too large and con&s;iderable, if the event has taken place. A circum&s;tance, perhaps more to be regret|ted, is that the enemy marched through a &s;trong and rough country, and were near that place, without the &s;malle&s;t oppo&s;i|tion. I have no other information upon the &s;ubject than what the&s;e papers contain: but we have little ground to expect that they have not accompli&s;hed their purpo&s;e. Further intelli|gence will be probably received to-day or to-morrow, when I &s;hall be happy to hear that they have paid for their enterpri&s;e. Of this, I confe&s;s however, I am not very &s;anguine in my ex|pectations.</P>
<P>This po&s;t had been con&s;idered as a proper depo&s;itory for &s;tores, by gentlemen, acquinted with it; and its &s;ecurity not thought que&s;tionable whil&s;t troops were pa&s;&s;ing through it. I had al&s;o directed that as many of the draughts in Connecticut as the place was capable of accommodating, &s;hould be collected there and inoculated, to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of a guard, hoping, by the time of their recovery, that the &s;ituation of the army would be &s;uch as to admit a &s;trong one to be &s;tationed there, and continued; but, unhappily for us, &s;uch languor and &s;upine|ne&s;s prevails every where, that we &s;eem unable to effect any point we wi&s;h, though never &s;o important and intere&s;ting. So early as the &s;ixth of March, I wrote to governor Trumbull, earne&s;tly reque&s;ting two thou&s;and militia to be &s;ent to general M'Dougal to be employed at Peek&s;kill and on the communi|cation in We&s;t-Che&s;ter county for &s;ix weeks. With this requi|&s;ition he mo&s;t readily complied &s;o far as his orders were nece&s;|&s;ary,
<PB N="53" REF="031423_0349_0FEC5CBFCECEB5E0">
and (I am certain) his influence would extend. This I have repeated, and this &s;upply he has exerted him&s;elf to furni&s;h: yet &s;o ineffectual have his endeavors been, that not more than eight hundred had come out, by general M'Dougal's return on the &s;eventeenth in&s;tant; nor did he expect more, from the ac|counts he had. In a word, &s;ir, no expedient or pains have been un-attempted by me to bring on troops, and to keep our affairs on a favorable footing.</P>
<P>I would again mention the ca&s;e of our pri&s;oners with the ene|my, and pray that the &s;ecret committee would &s;end to Mr. Bou|dinot &s;upplies of money for them as early as po&s;&s;ible. They are in great di&s;tre&s;s, and many officers have lately e&s;caped, con|trary to the tenor of their parole; &s;ome of whom are now here, urging that nece&s;&s;ity compelled them to the mea&s;ure.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS ye&s;ter&s;tay honored with your letter of the twen|ty-ninth ultimo, inclo&s;ing &s;undry re&s;olves.&mdash;Agreeable to the directions of Congre&s;s, I have written to the &s;tates of New-Hamp&s;hire and Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and urged them to complete and forward their troops de&s;tined for Ticonderoga, with all po&s;&s;ible expedition. The brigadiers gone there for the pre&s;ent are Fer|moy, Poor, Patter&s;on, and Learned. Nixon and Glover were al&s;o intended for that po&s;t under my fir&s;t plan, which was, that all the regiments to be rai&s;ed in tho&s;e &s;tates by the re&s;olve in September, &s;hould compo&s;e that army. But having by the ad|vice of my officers directed the route of eight regiments from
<PB N="54" REF="031423_0350_0FEC5CC402165128">
the latter to Peek&s;kill, to wait till the de&s;igns of general Howe were unfolded, the&s;e two officers were to follow them.&mdash;I did not particulari&s;e the brigadiers who were to go fir&s;t, or the re|giments; but left the matter to major-general Heath, who was in&s;tructed in general terms to pur&s;ue &s;uch mea&s;ures as &s;eemed mo&s;t likely to promote the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The colonels appointed to the New-Ham&s;hire regiments I never knew. Tho&s;e ordered to Ticonderoga from Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts by general Heath, and who I pre&s;ume have marched, were Bailey, We&s;&s;on, Jack&s;on, Mar&s;hall, Brewer, Bradford, and Francis. What proportions of their regiments have marched, I cannot a&s;certain: but I am per&s;uaded they were detached as fa&s;t as they were rai&s;ed, and circum&s;tances would admit. Fran|cis's, the fir&s;t of April, was returned five hundred &s;trong; and, by a letter from colonel Mar&s;hall about the fifteenth of la&s;t month, he expected to march in a day or two with the la&s;t di|vi&s;ion of his regiment that was ready, which would make about four hundred, including tho&s;e who had gone. The remainder (about &s;ixty) were to follow with the proper officers as &s;oon as they were fit,&mdash;the having been inoculated.</P>
<P>I have written to generals M'Dougal and Clinton to have the provi&s;ion removed from Derby, &amp;c. and directed that they &s;hould point out proper places for its reception in Ul&s;ter; al&s;o that &s;mall works and guards of militia will be e&s;&s;ential for its protection. * * *</P>
<P>The damage we &s;u&s;tained at Danbury, nor the enemy's lo&s;s, have not been tran&s;mitted with any accuracy: but, from the late&s;t accounts from thence, the former was not &s;o great, and and the latter more con&s;iderable, than was apprehended at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>I congratulate Congre&s;s upon the fortunate arrival of the Amphitrite with military and ordnance &s;tores:&mdash;it is an im|portant event. That of the French &s;hip at Bo&s;ton, and of the &s;loop from Martinique, added to the capture of the two provi|&s;ion &s;hips, are to be regarded as intere&s;ting too. I would here take the liberty to mention that I think all the military and ordnance &s;tores &s;hould be moved without a moment's delay to Springfield or &s;ome interior part of the country. Springfield &s;hould be the place, becau&s;e the elaboratory is there, and they will be more convenient to u&s;e as exigencies require. In their pre&s;ent &s;ituation their &s;ecurity is que&s;tionable; and, if an attack &s;hould be made in the ea&s;tern quarter, their lo&s;s is much to be apprehended. Before I quit this &s;ubject, I would beg leave to ob&s;erve al&s;o that the di&s;po&s;al and direction of military &s;tores
<PB N="55" REF="031423_0351_0FEC5CC8054A5308">
&s;hould be only with one body or with one per&s;on. At pre&s;ent this power is exerci&s;ed through &s;o many channels, that much confu&s;ion is introduced; and it cannot be avoided: nor will it be po&s;&s;ible that matters in this line &s;hould be conducted with any degree of propriety, unle&s;s Congre&s;s come into &s;ome regu|lations re&s;pecting them. The inclo&s;ed extract of a letter from general Heath will prove the expediency. Many other in|in&s;tances might be mentioned, were it nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The de&s;ertions from our army of late has been very con&s;ider|able. General Howe's proclamation, and the bounty allowed to tho&s;e who carry in their arms, have had an unhappy influ|ence on two many of the &s;oldiery; in a particular manner on tho&s;e who are not natives. * * *</P>
<P>I could wi&s;h &s;ome means could be devi&s;ed to cau&s;e more fre|quent de&s;ertions of [<HI>the enemy's</HI>] troops. Congre&s;s may think of &s;ome expedient: a larger bounty might have &s;ome effect, and money to the foreigners in lieu of land. The bounty given by general Howe to tho&s;e who carry in arms, is &s;ixteen dollars as we are told, though his proclamation only expre&s;&s;es that they &s;hall have the full value. To the inhabitants who will take up arms and join him, he promi&s;es land.</P>

<P>I WAS this morning honored with your letter of the third in&s;tant, with its inclo&s;ures.&mdash;General Arnold's promotion gives me much plea&s;ure. He has certainly di&s;covered in every in|&s;tance where he has had an opportunity, much bravery, activity, and enterpri&s;e. But what will be done about his rank?&mdash;he will not act mo&s;t probably under tho&s;e he commanded but a few weeks ago.</P>
<P>I tru&s;t the appointment of Mr. Ludwick as &s;uperintendant of bakers will have the &s;alutary con&s;equence you mention; I have been long a&s;&s;ured that many abu&s;es have been committed for want of &s;ome proper regulations in that department.</P>
<P>By major Troop, one of general Gates's aides, and who left Albany on tue&s;day la&s;t, I am informed the accounts of general Carleton's approach towards Ticonderoga were premature. He &s;ays general Gates received a letter before he came away, from brigadier-general Wayne, of the twenty-fourth ult. in which he mentioned nothing of it;&mdash;that three thou&s;and troops had arrived there, all in high &s;pirits and health, except nine;&mdash;and
<PB N="56" REF="031423_0352_0FEC5CCB756EA278">
that that po&s;t could never be carried without the lo&s;s of much blood. The proceedings of Congre&s;s and your letter of the twenty-ninth ultimo were the fir&s;t and only information I had of Mr. Carleton's being on the lake, having heard nothing upon the &s;ubject from general Gates or any other per&s;on.</P>
<P>In my la&s;t I mentioned that &s;ixteen dollars bounty were given by general Howe to de&s;erters with arms. I have rea&s;on to be|lieve from information received &s;ince, and which &s;eems to be generally credited, that he has advanced the bounty to twenty|four dollars.</P>
<P>It is much to be wi&s;hed that our printers were more di&s;creet in many of their publications. We &s;ee, almo&s;t in every paper, proclamations or accounts tran&s;mitted by the enemy, of an in|jurious nature. If &s;ome hint or caution could be given them on the &s;ubject, it might be of material &s;ervice.</P>
<P>By a per&s;on who has ju&s;t arrived here, it is reported that general Woo&s;ter is dead of his wounds.</P>
<P>I would mention to Congre&s;s that in a day or two our military che&s;t will be exhau&s;ted. I beg that a &s;upply may be forwarded as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible: if there &s;hould be a failure, we &s;hall have many things to apprehend.</P>

<P>I cannot pretend to &s;peak of colonel Conway's merits or abi|lities, of my own knowledge, having had but little opportunity to be acquainted with him.

<P>THE inclo&s;ed is a copy of a letter which was handed to me by mon&s;ieur Mottin de la Balme, from Silas Deane, e&s;quire. For a more particular account of his merit and &s;ervices, I mu&s;t refer you to him&s;elf. I have &s;ounded him as to his expecta|tions, and find that nothing under a lieutenant-colonelcy of hor&s;e will content him. If you &s;hould, from his own account, or from what you can collect from others, think proper to con|fer this rank upon him, there is no vacancy in any other corps except that of colonel Sheldon.</P>
<P>I am afraid we &s;hall never be able to find places vacant, equal to the expectations of the French gentlemen who are now her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, much le&s;s for tho&s;e that will follow.

In|deed it is not to be imagined that a gentleman and an old &s;ol|dier can &s;ubmit to be commanded by a per&s;on in this country, whom he remembers to have been his inferior in France. I know not how we can remedy this evil, or put a &s;top to the growth of it, but by being very circum&s;pect for the future, on whom we confer rank above that of a &s;ubaltern.</P>

<P>SINCE I had the honor of addre&s;&s;ing you on the fifth in&s;tant, nothing material has occurred.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed you will be plea&s;ed to receive a general return of our forces in Jer&s;ey, the &s;ixth in&s;tant, which is the fir&s;t I have been able to obtain with any degree of accuracy.</P>
<P>I have not heard from general De Haas &s;ince his promotion. As &s;oon as I was informed of it, I wrote and reque&s;ted him to repair to camp: but, having received no an&s;wer, I am appre|hen&s;ive my letter mi&s;carried. I wi&s;h Congre&s;s to give him no|tice of his appointment, and directions to join the army, if he accepts his commi&s;&s;ion and is not prevented by indi&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Through the board of war I have been favored with a copy of general Gate's letter of the twenty-ninth ultimo. Hud&s;on's|river and the pa&s;&s;es in the Highlands I always con&s;ider as ob|jects of great importance, and accordingly have provided for their &s;ecurity in the be&s;t manner my judgment could direct, and the circum&s;tances of the army admit. If they are le&s;s &s;e|cure than we wi&s;h them to be, it is owing to our inability and not to inattention. I have written to general M'Dougal, and will do it again, to employ much of his care upon this &s;ubject. War, in theory, and the modes of defence, are obvious and ea&s;y; but, in practice, they are more difficult. Unhappily for us, the means in our power do not always accord with our wi&s;hes or what would be our intere&s;t to pur&s;ue.</P>
<P>As yet none of the ea&s;tern troops have pa&s;&s;ed the North|river, except two &s;mall detachments from Connecticut and Rhode-I&s;land, amounting to about two hundred and &s;eventy, which mi&s;&s;ed my orders till they had got over. The&s;e I &s;hall &s;end back after we are more reinforced, unle&s;s the movements of the enemy in this quarter make their detention nece&s;&s;ary. The re&s;t of the ea&s;tern troops which have marched (except the &s;even regiments from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and three from New-Hamp|&s;hire, ordered immediately to Ticonderoga) are at and on their way to Peek&s;kill, as mentioned in my letter of the third,&mdash;where they are to remain with all the York troops except Van|&s;chaick's and Gan&s;evoorts now at the northward, till general Howe's de&s;igns and intended operations are better under&s;tood. This di&s;po&s;ition appearing to me and my general officers the be&s;t that could be made in our &s;tate of uncertainty, was adopted. The two troops of hor&s;e, recommended by Congre&s;s to be &s;ent to general Gates, &s;hall go as &s;oon as circum&s;tances will admit. At pre&s;ent we have not more than are con&s;tantly employed at the different po&s;ts.</P>

<P>THIS will be delivered you by general Arnold who ar|rived here to-day in his way to Philadelphia. He &s;eems to be anxious to &s;ettle his public accounts which are of con&s;iderable amount, and waits on Congre&s;s, hoping they will appoint a committee of their body, or of &s;uch gentlemen as they &s;hall judge proper, to take the matter into con&s;ideration. This he con&s;iders the more nece&s;&s;ary, as he has heard &s;ome reports have been propagated, injurious to his character as a man of inte|grity. If any &s;uch a&s;per&s;ions lie again&s;t him, it is but rea&s;on|able he &s;hould have an opportunity of vindicating him&s;elf and evincing his innocence.</P>
<P>I find he does not con&s;ider the promotion Congre&s;s have been plea&s;ed to confer upon him &s;ufficient to obviate the neglect ari&s;ing from their having omitted him in their late appointments of major-generals. He ob&s;erves it does not give him the rank he had a claim to from &s;eniority in the line of brigadiers, and that he is &s;ubject to be commanded by tho&s;e who had been in|ferior to him. He further adds, that Congre&s;s, in their la&s;t re&s;olve re&s;pecting him, have acknowledged him competent to the &s;tation of major-general, and therefore have done away every objection implied by their former omi&s;&s;ion. The&s;e con|&s;iderations are not without their weight, though I pretend not to judge what motives may have influenced the conduct of Con|gre&s;s upon this occa&s;ion.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS this morning honored with your letter of the tenth in&s;tant, accompanied by the proceedings of Congre&s;s of the day before.</P>
<P>The conduct of too many officers in withholding the pay of their &s;oldiers, I am per&s;uaded, is reprehen&s;ible, and has been the cau&s;e of unea&s;ine&s;s and of many de&s;ertions. Every mea&s;ure in my power will be exerted to prevent &s;uch abu&s;es in future, and every aid given to puni&s;h the offenders in an exemplary manner. But Congre&s;s will excu&s;e me when I tell them it will be impo&s;&s;ible to comply with their recommendation upon this &s;ubject, unle&s;s the general officers withdraw their attention from matters of the utmo&s;t importance, and &s;uch as require their con&s;tant care. Were this not the ca&s;e, the di&s;per&s;ed &s;ituation of the officers at this time through the different &s;tates on the recruiting &s;ervice would prohibit the enquiry. Nor do I ap|prehend the regulations empowering and enjoining the regimen|tal payma&s;ters to bring them to an account will be found com|petent to the end. Such officers will be proper to &s;tate the ac|counts in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and to receive vouchers, &amp;c. but will not do to &s;ettle them finally, as their connexions with the regiments will &s;ubject them much to the influence of the of|ficers.</P>
<P>I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, if two or three gentlemen of integrity, and of ability in accounts, were appointed auditors to attend the army till the bu&s;ine&s;s is fini&s;hed, it would be the be&s;t expe|dient that could be fallen on. They would be a check on the payma&s;ters, and, I am per&s;uaded, will be the means of the accounts being fairly and ju&s;tly liquidated. If a &s;ettlement can be once obtained, I tru&s;t the &s;ame confu&s;ion will never take place again, as the payma&s;ters will receive and pay all money due to the regiments, and account for it, and as the army is on a more permanent footing than it ever was before: for this, l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e mo&s;t other inconveniences and difficulties which we have experienced, is to be imputed in a great mea&s;ure to &s;hort en|li&s;tments and the frequent di&s;&s;olution of our troops.</P>
<P>A return of the army in Jer&s;ey, as late as the &s;ixth in&s;tant,
<PB N="61" REF="031423_0357_0FEC5CD5ED101648">
I tran&s;mitted ye&s;terday morning in a letter by Mr. Randolph of Che&s;nut-&s;treet, which you will probably receive to-day, and from which Congre&s;s will be able to determine the expediency of calling out the militia from Delaware and Penn&s;ylvania.&mdash;Though it gives me pain that we &s;hould be under the nece&s;&s;ity of recurring to &s;uch a mea&s;ure, yet I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e it to be advi&s;able. Our army is weak, and by no means equal to that of the enemy; and, till their de&s;igns are known and we are more reinforced with regular troops, we &s;hould be prepared in the be&s;t manner we can. I would ob&s;erve, if the militia are called out, it &s;hould be for a fixed determinate time: for, though they will certainly return when that expires, yet that is more tolerable than for them to go off in parties every day as their whim and caprice &s;ugge&s;t,&mdash;which has always been the ca&s;e when the time was not &s;tated. I would al&s;o ob&s;erve, if it is po&s;&s;ible, they &s;hould be engaged to march out of their &s;tates if ordered. If their &s;ervice is located, they will move with great reluctance, if they do at all.</P>
<P>On &s;aturday a &s;mart &s;kirmi&s;h happened with a detachment of our troops who attached a number of the enemy near Pi&s;cata|wa, in which our men behaved well, and obliged the enemy to give way twice (as reported to me) with lo&s;s. The enemy re|ceiving a &s;trong reinforcement, our people retreated to their po&s;t.&mdash;I cannot give the particulars, as they have not been &s;uf|ficiently a&s;certained. The picquets were al&s;o attacked ye&s;ter|day by &s;ome of our parties from Boundbrook, and forced within their lines.</P>

<P>YOUR letter of the fifteenth I had the honor to receive la&s;t night at eleven o'clock.&mdash;The commi&s;&s;ion inclo&s;ed for mon|&s;ieur Armand I &s;hall deliver him as &s;oon as I &s;ee him&mdash;Agree|able to your reque&s;t, I will give commi&s;&s;ions to the brigadiers, and will a&s;certain their rank by their original commi&s;&s;ions when I obtain them.&mdash;The inquiry directed re&s;pecting major Campbell, &s;hall be made, and that be done which &s;hall appear right.</P>
<P>I fear it will be hardly po&s;&s;ible to &s;atisfy the views and claims of &s;ome of the French gentlemen. The late promotion of mon&s;ieur Malmady, though highly honorable, and &s;uch as &s;hould be con&s;idered fully if not more than adequate to his pre|ten&s;ions,
<PB N="62" REF="031423_0358_0FEC5CDA1B147AD8">
taken upon any principle, does not come up to his de|mands. He arrived here ye&s;terday morning, and has been writing to me upon the &s;ubject.

It would have been happy for us, particularly for me and for the gentlemen them&s;elves, if a too ea&s;y grant of favors had not induced them to contemn all rank in our army under that of field-officers:&mdash;nor is it in my power to give commands to every appointment. I &s;hall inform mon&s;ieur Armand (and re|concile him to it in the be&s;t manner I can) that there is no va|cancy for him at pre&s;ent: and I would beg leave to &s;ugge&s;t, that, where promotions are made in future from political and honorary motives, it would be well for Congre&s;s to explain to the gentlemen that it may be &s;ome time before they can be put in actual command. This might prevent their entertaining &s;u&s;picions of neglect on my part, which the &s;ituation of the army will not allow me to obviate. There is no vacancy for mon|&s;ieur Malmady, of the rank he now holds, unle&s;s the merits of many other officers, who have &s;erved with reputation and much longer here, are to be overlooked to make may for him.&mdash;Such a mea&s;ure will neither be practicable, nor prudent to at|tempt.</P>
<P>By a letter from general Heard who is at Pompton, I am in|formed that colonels Barton and Bur&s;kirk with three hundred tory levies from Bergen, on the morning of the thirteenth, at|tempted to &s;urpri&s;e and cut off about &s;eventy of his militia &s;ta|tioned at Pyramus. The officer happily had notice of their de&s;ign, and eluded it by moving his po&s;t. It happened that the morning was foggy; and the enemy entering at different places, their parties engaged.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I BEG leave to inform Congre&s;s, that, immediately after the receipt of their re&s;olve of the twenty-&s;ixth of March, re|commending the office of adjutant-general to be filled by the appointent of a per&s;on of abilities and un&s;u&s;pected attachment to our cau&s;e, I wrote to colonel Timothy Pickering of Salem, offering him the po&s;t in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and tran&s;mitting at the &s;ame time a letter for colonel William Lee whom Congre&s;s had been plea&s;ed to mention, to be delivered him in ca&s;e my offer could not be accepted. This conduct, in preference of colonel Pickering, I was induced to adopt from the high cha|racter I had of him, both as a great military genius cultivated by an indu&s;trious attention to the &s;tudy of war, and as a gentle|man of liberal education, di&s;tingui&s;hed zeal, and great method and activity in bu&s;ine&s;s. This character of him I had from gentlemen of di&s;tinction and merit, and on who&s;e judgment I could rely.</P>
<P>When my letter reached colonel Pickering, at fir&s;t view he thought his &s;ituation in re&s;pect to public affairs would not permit him to accept the po&s;t. That for colonel Lee he &s;ent immedi|ately to him, who, in con&s;equence of it, repaired to head-quar|ters. By colonel Lee I received a letter from colonel Pick|ering, &s;tating more particularly the cau&s;es which prevented him accepting the office when it was offered, and a&s;&s;uring me that he would in a little time accommodate his affairs in &s;uch a manner as to come into any military po&s;t in which he might be &s;ervice|able, and thought equal to.</P>
<P>Here I am to mark with peculiar &s;atisfaction, in ju&s;tice to colonel Lee who has de&s;ervedly acquired the reputation of a good officer, that he expre&s;&s;ed a di&s;tru&s;t of his abilities to fill the appointment intended for him; and, on hearing that colonel Pickering would accept it, he not only offered but wi&s;hed to relinqui&s;h his claim to it in favor of him, whom he declared he con&s;idered, from a very intimate and friendly acquaintance, as
<PB N="64" REF="031423_0360_0FEC5CE471809B80">
a fir&s;t military character; and that he knew no gentleman bet|ter or &s;o well qualified for the po&s;t among us.&mdash;Matters being thus circum&s;tanced, and colonel Lee plea&s;ed with the command he was in, I wrote to colonel Pickering on his return, who ac|cepted the office, and is daily expected.</P>
<P>In this bu&s;ine&s;s I beg Congre&s;s to be a&s;&s;ured, though colonel Lee was po&s;tponed in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, their recommendation had its due weight; and that no motive, other than a regard to the &s;ervice, induced me to prefer colonel Pickering. His acknowledged abilities and equal zeal,&mdash;without derogating from the merits of colonel Lee who holds a high place in my e&s;teem,&mdash;gave him a preference: and I flatter my&s;elf the cau&s;e will be promoted in his appointment, e&s;pecially as we &s;hall have two good officers in lieu of one, who, I am per|&s;uaded, will do honor to them&s;elves in the line in which they move.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering the pa&s;&s;es through the Highlands of the utmo&s;t importance to &s;ecure, I &s;ent generals Greene and Knox about a fortnight ago to &s;ee what had been done for their defence, and to con&s;ult with the general officers they &s;hould meet, upon &s;uch further mea&s;ures as might be deemed nece&s;&s;ary for their greater &s;afety. The inclo&s;ed copy of their report will fully convey their &s;entiments upon the &s;ubject; to which I beg leave to re|fer Congre&s;s.&mdash;I have &s;ent General Putnam to command in that quarter, and have in&s;tructed him to u&s;e every po&s;&s;ible means in his power for expediting and effecting the works and ob&s;tructions mentioned in the report. Fearing that the cables might not be procured in a time, I have directed his particular and immediate attention to fixing the boom. However, as the cables would render that more &s;ecure, and will be extremely &s;erviceable in the opinion of the officers,&mdash;if they are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o be had in Philadelphia, I would advi&s;e Congre&s;s to order them to be purcha&s;ed and forwarded without lo&s;s of time:&mdash;they cannot be got el&s;ewhere. They mu&s;t be proportioned to the width of the river, which is about five hundred and forty yards; and, as they will be of mo&s;t u&s;e if diagonally laid, the gentlemen think they &s;hould not be le&s;s than four hundred and fifty fa|thoms long, and of the large&s;t &s;ize that can be had. Unle&s;s they are large and &s;ub&s;tantial, they will an&s;wer no purpo&s;e, and will not &s;u&s;tain their weight when &s;tretched.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be glad to know whether it be the intention of Con|gre&s;s that one of the already-appointed general officers may be a&s;&s;igned to the command of the light-hor&s;e, or whether they have in contemplation the appointing of one for this purpo&s;e:
<PB N="65" REF="031423_0361_0FEC5CE618575E78">
&mdash;if the fir&s;t, I &s;hall immediately name one to that duty;&mdash;if the &s;econd, they will be plea&s;ed to choo&s;e one, as it is time we &s;hould have our arrangements complete.</P>
<P>I have nothing of importance to communicate, unle&s;s it is that &s;eventeen &s;hips are &s;aid to have arrived at New-York on the twenty-&s;econd, and that others were in the offing. A re|port has al&s;o prevailed, and has come through two or three channels, that governor Tryon (that was) is dead of the wound he received in the Danbury expedition: and one account is that lieutenant-colonel Walcot fell in the engagement at Ridgefield. I do not know how far the facts are to be depended on:&mdash;it &s;eems certain that Mr. Tryon was wounded.</P>

<P>THE inclo&s;ed is a copy of a letter received ye&s;terday from general Howe. Congre&s;s will perceive, by referring to the copy of his letter of the twenty-fir&s;t of April tran&s;mitted in mine of the twenty-&s;ixth, that he per&s;evered in his demand for an equal number of pri&s;oners to be returned for tho&s;e &s;ent out by him; which has been the &s;ubject of controver&s;y between us. As general Howe has called upon me again for my final deci&s;ion upon the &s;ubject, and Congre&s;s are fully po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it, having received tran&s;cripts of every paper re&s;pecting it,&mdash;I wi&s;h them to take the matter under their earlie&s;t con&s;ideration, and to in|form me as &s;oon as they can, whether the grounds on which it has been conducted by me are agreeable to their ideas, and whether my objections are or are not to be departed from. The affair is particularly &s;tated in my letter of the ninth ultimo to general Howe, in an&s;wer to the paper addre&s;&s;ed to me by lieutenant-colonel Walcot; copies of which were inclo&s;ed in my letter to the pre&s;ident on the tenth of the &s;ame month. The de&s;pute, &s;o fat as general Lee is concerned, re&s;ts at pre&s;ent on their declaring him exchangeable, as other pri&s;oners are, on
<PB N="66" REF="031423_0362_0FEC5CE7E78E6378">
the principle of equality of rank; to en&s;ure which, or his &s;afety, lieutenant-colonel Campbell and the He&s;&s;ian field-offi|cers are detained. The other objection to returning their pri|&s;oners is, that a great proportion of tho&s;e &s;ent out by them were not fit &s;ubjects of exchange when relea&s;ed, and were made &s;o by the &s;everity of their treatment and confinement, and there|fore a deduction &s;hould be made from the li&s;t.</P>
<P>Good faith &s;eems to require that we &s;hould return as many of theirs at lea&s;t as we received effectives from them,&mdash;I mean &s;uch as could be con&s;idered capable of being exchanged; and perhaps &s;ound policy, that the agreement &s;ub&s;i&s;ting for ex|changes &s;hould continue. On the other hand it may be &s;aid that our pri&s;oners in general, in the enemy's hands at pre&s;ent, will have greater &s;ecurity by our retaining them, and that ge|neral Howe will be le&s;s apt to relinqui&s;h any part of his claim, the more the number in our hands is dimini&s;hed by an ex|change.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s I am under great difficulty in this bu&s;ine&s;s. But what is more particularly the cau&s;e of this application is the latter part of the fir&s;t paragraph of the inclo&s;ed copy,&mdash;"<HI>and for your determination re&s;pecting the pri&s;oners now here, that I may make my arrangements accordingly.</HI>"&mdash;This is couched in terms of great ambiguity; and I am really at a lo&s;s what inter|pretation to give it,&mdash;whether he intends that his conduct re|&s;pecting them &s;hall be as I advi&s;e&mdash;(this appears more favora|ble than can well be expected),&mdash;or that, if the previous de|mand is not an&s;wered in a &s;atisfactory manner, he &s;hall con&s;ider them on a different footing from that on which our former pri&s;oners were, and the agreement totally di&s;&s;olved. We are told government offered the pri&s;oners they took to the India company, and they have procured an act di&s;pen&s;ing with that of the habeas-corpus in particular ca&s;es of per&s;ons &s;uppo&s;ed inimical to them, &amp;c. How far they or their commanders may adopt the&s;e mea&s;ures, remains to be known:&mdash;I have only mentioned them as they re&s;pect the general &s;ubject of my letter.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding my recommendation agreeable to what I conceived to be the &s;en&s;e of Congre&s;s, lieutenant-colonel Camp|bell's treatment continues to be &s;uch as cannot be ju&s;tified ei|ther on the principles of genero&s;ity, or &s;trict retaliation; as I have authentic information, and I doubt not you will have the &s;ame, that general Lee's &s;ituation is far from being rigorous or uncomfortable:&mdash;except his not being permitted to go at large
<PB N="67" REF="031423_0363_0FEC5CEECB89A8B8">
on parole, he has rea&s;on to be content with every other circum|&s;tance of his treatment.</P>
<P>I am ju&s;t moving to Boundbrook, from whence I returned ye&s;terday morning. On monday morning a body of the enemy advanced near that po&s;t. They retreated, on &s;eeing a detach|ment march to meet them. There was &s;ome firing at long &s;hot, but without any great damage. We had only three men &s;light|ly wounded.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I did my&s;elf the honor to write to you the twen|ty-ninth, I have received the inclo&s;ed intelligence. As it comes from a per&s;on of veracity, and one who is much in the confidence of the enemy, I have no doubt as to the fact of the two brigades having come over from New-York to Amboy, and al&s;o that a number of waggons have been brought from Staten and Long-I&s;land. The&s;e accounts are corroborated by informa|tion of the &s;ame kind from &s;everal different quarters. But I do not place &s;o much dependence upon the account of the intended at|tack
<PB N="68" REF="031423_0364_0FEC5CF060150340">
upon this place, becau&s;e I think, if &s;uch a matter was really in agitation, it would be kept a profound &s;ecret: I rather am of opinion that it is thrown out to deceive. But at any rate, taking it for granted that they are a&s;&s;embling their troops and carriages, what can they have in view but a move, either imme|diately, or when their reinforcement, (if they get any) arrives? and if they do move, I can &s;ee no other object but Philadelphia. It is true they have &s;eemed for &s;ome time pa&s;t to have laid a|&s;ide all thoughts of attempting that city by land: but if they had only the attacking this army in contemplation, they would never encumber them&s;elves with a large train of waggons, which, if they were &s;ucce&s;sful, would retard them in their pur|&s;uit, and, if defeated, would be in danger of falling into our hands.</P>
<P>I inclo&s;e you an extract of a letter which I received from general Sullivan.&mdash;If the two India &s;hips which have been cut down are gone out to &s;ea, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e they are intended for the Delaware, becau&s;e they are not capable of performing a rough or long voyage. This, if true, looks as if a &s;udden cor|re&s;ponding move by land was intended; for they will never &s;end their &s;hips long before their troops.</P>
<P>The&s;e, you will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve, are mere conjectures upon circum&s;tances: for the actions of the the enemy have for a long time pa&s;t been &s;o different from appearances, that I hardly dare to form an opinion. But I would wi&s;h to profit by every piece of intelligence, and be prepared to ward off every danger that threatens. I would therefore recommend that the Penn&s;ylvania militia, who are a&s;&s;embled at Bri&s;tol for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of guarding the river and opo&s;ing the pa&s;&s;age of the enemy, &s;hould be put under the command of a good general officer, who would &s;ee that they are kept to their duty, and prepared for a &s;udden emergency. Except this is done, they may as well be at home.</P>
<P>I la&s;t night received a letter from general M'Dougal, an extract of which you have inclo&s;ed. By this it appears that a reinforcement is arrived, but whether from Canada or Europe, is uncertain. You will ob&s;erve that he likewi&s;e mentions, that eight tran&s;ports with foot, and a &s;chooner with hor&s;es and hay, had fallen down.&mdash;We can only form conjectures at pre&s;ent of the place of their de&s;tination: but if they &s;tand &s;outhward, Phi|ladelphia is the mo&s;t probable place.</P>
<P>I have the plea&s;ure to communicate a very agreeable piece of intelligence which I have received from general Par&s;ons, of the de&s;truction of twelve of the enemy's ve&s;&s;els in Sag-harbor
<PB N="69" REF="031423_0365_0FEC5CF4F9444358">

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MONSIEUR Coudray is ju&s;t arrived at camp, and pro|po&s;es to &s;et out to-morrow for Philadelphia. What his views are, I am uncertain, having had no conver&s;ation with him upon the &s;ubject: but I find an idea prevails that there is an agree|ment between Mr. Deane and him. that he &s;hall have the chief command of the artillery. How well founded this opinion may be, I cannot determine: but if it be true, it may involve the mo&s;t injurious con&s;equences. General Knox, who has de&s;er|vedly acquired the character of one of the mo&s;t valuable offi|cers in the &s;ervice, and who, combating almo&s;t innumerable difficulties in the department he fills, has placed the artillery upon a footing that does him the greate&s;t honor,&mdash;he, I am per&s;uaded, would con&s;ider him&s;elf injured by an appointment &s;uperceding his command, and would not think him&s;elf at liber|ty to continue in the &s;ervice. Should &s;uch an event take place in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, there would be too much rea&s;on to apprehend a train of ills, &s;uch as might convul&s;e and unhinge this important department.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing mon&s;ieur Coudray to have made &s;uch an agree|ment, the ca&s;e is of great difficulty, and, in my opinion, is wor|thy of the mo&s;t delicate con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s. Yet may not means be &s;till devi&s;ed to &s;atisfy this gentleman by appoint|ing him to &s;ome command not derogatory to his promi&s;ed rank, and which will be agreeable to him? From the recommenda|tions we have had of him. I am obliged to e&s;teem him of high character, and of great knowledge in what he profe&s;&s;es: and, from this con&s;ideration and the manner in which he is mentioned to us, it appears that much addre&s;s and delicacy mu&s;t be u&s;ed, to conciliate matters.</P>
<P>Many rea&s;ons, be&s;ides tho&s;e I have noted, might be a&s;&s;igned for continuing general Knox fir&s;t in command in this depart|ment, which, on reflection, will readily occur. I would only ob&s;erve, without in&s;inuating the mo&s;t di&s;tant &s;hadow of di&s;tru&s;t of mon&s;ieur Coudray's honor, candor, or integrity, that, on the general maxims of prudence and policy, it may be que&s;tioned with much propriety whether &s;o important a command as that

of the artillery &s;hould be ve&s;ted in any but a native, or one at|tached by the ties of intere&s;t to the&s;e &s;tates.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s will be plea&s;ed to excu&s;e the freedom I have u&s;ed upon this occa&s;ion, and, I tru&s;t, will impute it to the impor|tance of the &s;ubject which gave ri&s;e to it.</P>

<P>THE inclo&s;ed copies of generals Gates and Poor's letters, which ju&s;t now came to hand, contain the late&s;t advices from the northern army. The&s;e I thought it proper to tran&s;mit, as I am not authori&s;ed to conclude that general Gates had writ|ten to Congre&s;s upon the &s;ubject of their contents. I wi&s;h our accounts from that quarter may be happy, if Mr. Carleton makes an attack.&mdash;The &s;hameful deficiency in all our armies affords but too ju&s;t grounds for di&s;agreeable apprehen&s;ions: if the quotas a&s;&s;igned the different &s;tates are not immediately filled we &s;hall have every thing to fear. We &s;hall never be able to re&s;i&s;t their force, if the militia are to be relied on; nor do I know whether their aid, feeble and ineffectual as it is, is much to be expected.&mdash;Can no expedients be devi&s;ed to complete the regiments, and to rou&s;e our unthinking countrymen from their lethargy?&mdash;If there can, the &s;ituation of our affairs calls loudly for it.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WOULD take the liberty of addre&s;&s;ing a few lines to Congre&s;s on a matter which appears to me of importance, and which is con&s;idered in the &s;ame light by many of our officers, and others not in the military line.&mdash;The &s;ubject I allude to is the condition of many per&s;ons now with the enemy, who de|luded by their arts and a mi&s;guided attachment to their mea|&s;ures, fled from the protection of the &s;tates, to find &s;ecurity
<PB N="71" REF="031423_0367_0FEC5BEA65EBBF98">
with them, and who, in many in&s;tances, are in arms again&s;t us.</P>
<P>It has been &s;ugge&s;ted through various channels,&mdash;and the &s;ugge&s;tion &s;eems to be credited, e&s;pecially as &s;ome have already e&s;caped,&mdash;that many of the&s;e unhappy people, convinced of their error and the wicked part they have taken, would embrace the earlie&s;t opportunity of leaving the enemy and returning a|mong us were they &s;ure of being received into our friend&s;hip again, and of enjoying their property and the rights of citizens.</P>
<P>This &s;ubject, in the con&s;ideration of it, &s;trikes me as impor|tant, intere&s;ting, and delicate,&mdash;involving many con&s;equences worthy of mature deliberation and attention. As &s;uch,&mdash;and, deeming my&s;elf incompetent to it,&mdash;I think it my duty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ub|mit it to Congre&s;s for their di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, to take &s;uch mea&s;ures therein as they &s;hall e&s;teem nece&s;&s;ary and right.</P>
<P>If the&s;e people, particularly tho&s;e in arms, are ingenuous in what has been hinted, and it is their wi&s;h, or that of any con&s;i|derable part of them, to return,&mdash;I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that it would be expedient and founded in &s;ound policy, to give every &s;uita|ble a&s;&s;urance to induce them to come. Such an event would be attended with &s;alutary effects, would weaken the enemy, di&s;tre&s;s them greatly, and would probably have a mo&s;t happy influence in preventing others from joining their arms. On the other hand, the indulgence may be liable to great abu&s;e, &s;up|po&s;ing it not to be duly guarded: or if the effects produced by it &s;hould be partial they will not be adequate to the ends in view. Yet, as the enemy on their part are u&s;ing every device they are capable of, to &s;educe both &s;oldiers and citizens from our &s;ervice into theirs, and have &s;ucceeded but too well, it is generally though in the military line that &s;omething &s;hould be attempted to counteract them. Whether Congre&s;s will be of the &s;ame &s;entiment, and,&mdash;if they &s;hould,&mdash;what and how ex|ten&s;ive the mode and indulgence ought to be, is entirely with them.</P>
<P>There is one difficulty which occurs with me, &s;uppo&s;ing the mea&s;ure to be adopted.&mdash;What line of di&s;crimination can be drawn upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion; though circum&s;tances &s;hould differ and &s;eem to require it? While the poor, deluded, ignorant, duped by artifices and a thou&s;and cau&s;es to lead them wrong, have a claim to their country's pardon and indulgence, there are many of well-informed under&s;tanding, who, from their ear|ly-avowed ho&s;tile di&s;po&s;itions and inveterate di&s;regard of her rights, and tho&s;e who have taken a double and triple part, can|not have the &s;ame pretentions;&mdash;who&s;e only view in returning
<PB N="72" REF="031423_0368_0FEC5CFF72D87EA8">
may be to &s;erve their own &s;ordid purpo&s;es, and the better to promote tho&s;e plans they have &s;teadily pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>One thing more I would ob&s;erve, which is, that if Congre&s;s judge an adoption of mea&s;ures eligible on the &s;ubject of my letter, the &s;ooner it is come into, the better, for the mo&s;t ob|vious rea&s;ons; and the time allowed for tho&s;e to return who wi&s;h the indulgence, &s;hould be fixed at a &s;hort period,&mdash;not longer, in my opinion, than till the<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Left blank in the original.</HI></NOTE> day of<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Left blank in the original.</HI></NOTE> next: otherwi&s;e they may avail them&s;elves of the circum&s;tance, and wait events to decide their choice. If any good con&s;e|quences are produced, the means can be renewed and further extended.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s will be plea&s;ed to excu&s;e me for thus freely com|municating my &s;entiments, e&s;pecially when I a&s;&s;ure them that they are dictated by what I e&s;teem my duty.</P>

<POSTSCRIPT>
<P>P. S. The more I con&s;ider the &s;ubject of my letter, the more important and intere&s;ting it appears. I am inclined to think, if the mea&s;ure propo&s;ed &s;hould be deemed expedient, that it will be better that the indulgencies and a&s;&s;urances for their return &s;hould be communicated through the medium of &s;ome &s;econd, &s;ecret hand, qualified to offer them and negotiate the bu&s;ine&s;s, rather than by an act of public authority. Op|portunities, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, may be found, by which they may obtain due information in that way, and which will not hold out to the enemy the &s;ame cau&s;e of &s;u&s;picion and of vi|gilance to prevent their e&s;caping. Whatever mode &s;hall be con|&s;idered mo&s;t advi&s;able, &s;hould be immediately adopted. What time &s;hould be allowed in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, I am at a lo&s;s to de|termine: if the continuance is too &s;hort, they may be danger of their not being appri&s;ed &s;o as to get off: if it is too long, they'll defer matters to the la&s;t, and act then as circum&s;tances of intere&s;t dictate.&mdash;To err in the former will be lea&s;t inju|rious.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I THIS morning had the honor of your letter of the fifth with its inclo&s;ures.&mdash;The re&s;olution of the thirtieth of May, re&s;pecting the French gentlemen who came pa&s;&s;engers in the Amphitrite, reached camp before your letter, and has ex|cited much unea&s;ine&s;s in the artillery corps. The inclo&s;ed copy of a letter from general Knox will convey their anxiety upon the &s;ubject,&mdash;which I think it nece&s;&s;ary to tran&s;mit, as well from duty as on account of his reque&s;t.</P>
<P>The difficulties upon this occa&s;ion ari&s;e from the peculiar circum&s;tances of mo&s;t of the officiers compo&s;ing the artillery regiments at this time. I do not know, for my own part, what operation Congre&s;s preci&s;ely meant the re&s;olution &s;hould have; but if the commi&s;&s;ions which the&s;e gentlemen are to receive &s;hould give them rank from the date of tho&s;e they had from the king of France, or from their compact with Mr. Deane, there are but few officers now in the artillery who will not be &s;uper|ceded in their command, unle&s;s &s;ome method is adopted to pre|vent it. This, I am per&s;uaded, Congre&s;s had not in contem|plation, becau&s;e it is oppo&s;ed to policy and to ju&s;tice; and I am led to believe the re&s;olution was come into for want of due information how matters were circum&s;tanced in this in&s;tance.</P>
<P>The officers now in the artillery I am obliged to con&s;ider of great merit: experience has proved them to be mo&s;t warmly attached to the rights of their country; and their conduct in the line of their profe&s;&s;ion has been &s;uch as does the highe&s;t ho|nor to them&s;elves and the gentleman who immediately com|mands them. Without derogating in the lea&s;t from the cha|racter of the French officers who are to be commi&s;&s;ioned, and whom I wi&s;h to receive every countenance they merit, there is &s;trong rea&s;on to doubt (laying a&s;ide every con&s;ideration of policy) whether they have &s;een as much real &s;ervice as our own in the cour&s;e of two campaigns. It would be hard, not to &s;ay unju&s;t, that the latter &s;hould lo&s;e their command when they have a claim to every mark of favor, and after they have taken great
<PB N="74" REF="031423_0370_0FEC5D096DE79A28">
pains to form their companies: the &s;ervice requires that they &s;hould not; and I am convinced the event would be attended with the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences.</P>
<P>But what is to be done?&mdash;This is a ca&s;e of difficulty, view it as you will.&mdash;I am not for rejecting the French gentlemen:&mdash;far otherwi&s;e,&mdash;I am for employing them: and public faith, and the encouragements given to bring them over, demand that it &s;hould be done. After much thought and con&s;ideration upon the &s;ubject, two modes occur to me, as the only po&s;&s;ible ones by which it can be effected, and by which the inconveniences I have mentioned can be remedied. One is, that a new corps of artillery &s;hould be formed, and the&s;e gentlemen attached to it. This we have rea&s;on to fear, cannot be done, from the difficul|ties we have experienced in rai&s;ing men, and from their having no intere&s;t or connexions with the people. Their &s;ituation in &s;uch ca&s;e, if they are men of &s;entiment and active di&s;po&s;itions, would be irk&s;ome and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing:&mdash;The other is, that our pre&s;ent officers now under con&s;ideration &s;hould have their commi&s;&s;ions antedated, to give them precedency of rank: and this may be done with the greater propriety as mo&s;t of them were intended to hold the po&s;ts they now &s;u&s;tain, before the French gentle|men had any claim upon us. It is true they were not commi&s;|&s;ioned, becau&s;e the old corps exi&s;ted under the fir&s;t arrange|ment. Further it is &s;aid,&mdash;and there is no doubt of the fact,&mdash;that tho&s;e gentlemen were promoted by brevet ju&s;t before their departure from France, merely to give them rank here;&mdash;ante|cedent to which, our officers were &s;uperior to them in this point; and the&s;e brevets only confer local rank, confined to the French American colonies.</P>
<P>This latter mode appears the mo&s;t eligible: if it is adopted, they will be di&s;tributed through the corps as a&s;&s;i&s;tant officers. Their want of a knowledge in our language incapacitates them for command in the fir&s;t in&s;tance; and not only &s;o, but to place them at the head of companies, over officers that have been at great trouble, pains and expen&s;e in rai&s;ing the men, would be both unmilitary and unju&s;t.&mdash;I &s;hall now quit the &s;ubject, wi&s;h|ing that whatever will be&s;t conciliate matters and advance the public good, may be done; &s;ugge&s;ting at the &s;ame time with all deference, as it is much ea&s;ier to prevent evils than to reme|dy them after they have happened, it will be well, in all ca&s;es of foreign and indeed other applications, that the con&s;e|quences, which granting them will involve, &s;hould be maturely weighed and taken in every point of view. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e of difficulty, things, I am per&s;uaded, might have been adju&s;ted
<PB N="75" REF="031423_0371_0FEC5D0D033C2BB8">
with the greate&s;t facility, had the committee of foreign appli|cation been fully po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the circum&s;tances re&s;pecting the artillery regiments.</P>
<P>By a letter from general Gates, of the &s;econd in&s;tant, tran&s;|mitting a copy of one from general Poor, the enemy who were at Split-Rock according to their la&s;t advices which I forwarded, have returned down the lake. Captain Whitcomb had been &s;ent out to reconnoitre, and reported on his return that only one boat remained.</P>
<P>From &s;undry accounts from New-York, there is rea&s;on to believe the enemy are on the point of making &s;ome expedition. Their preparation of &s;hips for troops, light-hor&s;e, &amp;c. indi|cates that they intend to go by water. What their object is, yet remains a &s;ecret. The inclo&s;ed copy of an examination is very particular, and as recent as any that I have received.&mdash;The per&s;on who gave the information belongs to Cape-May county, and appeared to be a &s;en&s;ible intelligent lad: A de|&s;erter of the &s;eventy-fir&s;t this moment came in: you al&s;o have his examination inclo&s;ed.</P>

<P>I WAS this morning honored with your favor of the &s;ixth in&s;tant, with its inclo&s;ures.&mdash;I am extremely happy in the ap|probation Congre&s;s have been plea&s;ed to expre&s;s of my conduct re&s;pecting the propo&s;ed cartel for the pri&s;oners, and &s;hall go|vern my&s;elf by the principles which influenced me on that occa|&s;ion, and &s;uch other as &s;hall appear right and ju&s;t, &s;hould there be any further negociation on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I &s;hall order a return to be made of the chaplains in &s;ervice, which &s;hall be tran&s;mitted as &s;oon as it is obtained. At pre&s;ent, as the regiments are greatly di&s;per&s;ed, part in one place and part another and accurate &s;tates of them have not been made, it will not be in my power to forward it immediately. I &s;hall here take occa&s;ion to mention that I communicated the re&s;olution appointing a brigade-chaplain in the place of all others; to the &s;everal brigadiers. They are all of opinion that it will be im|po&s;&s;ible for them to di&s;charge the duty; that many inconveni|ences and much di&s;&s;atisfaction will be the re&s;ult; and that no e&s;tabli&s;hment appears &s;o good in this in&s;tance as the old one. Among many other weighty objections to the mea&s;ure, it has been &s;ugge&s;ted that it has a tendency to introduce religious di&s;|putes
<PB N="76" REF="031423_0372_0FEC5D0F307A33B8">
into the army, which above all things &s;hould be avoided,&mdash;and in many in&s;tances would compell men to a mode of wor|&s;hip which they do not profe&s;s. The old e&s;tabli&s;hment gives every regiment an opportunity of having a chaplain of their own religious &s;entiments,&mdash;is founded on a plan of a more ge|nerous toleration,&mdash;and the choice of chaplains to officiate has been generally in the regiments. Suppo&s;ing one chaplain could do the duties of a brigade (which &s;uppo&s;ition however is inad|mi&s;&s;ible when we view things in practice), that being compo&s;ed of four or five, perhaps in &s;ome in&s;tances, &s;ix regiments, there might be &s;o many different modes of wor&s;hip. I have mentioned the opinion of the officers and the&s;e hints to Congre&s;s upon this &s;ubject, from a principle of duty, and becau&s;e I am well a&s;&s;ured it is mo&s;t foreign to their wi&s;hes or intention to excite, by any act, the &s;malle&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s and jealou&s;y among the troops.</P>
<P>There remains no room to believe otherwi&s;e than that the enemy are on the point of moving: this is confirmed by intelli|gence from all quarters, and through &s;o many different chan|nels, that we mu&s;t con&s;ider it certain. Whether they will move by land or water, or by both, cannot be a&s;certained; nor is their de&s;tination preci&s;ely known: but every circum&s;tance points out Philadelphia as their object. Being of this opinion, I have directed the return of general Mifflin. Before he left Phila|delphia, I wrote, countermanding the order for his coming here; but he did not receive my letter.&mdash;I would al&s;o mention to Congre&s;s that I think the military &s;tores, lately arrived, and at or coming to Philadelphia, &s;hould be removed to a place of perfect &s;ecurity. Though I would not excite needle&s;s unea&s;y apprehen&s;ions, prudence requires that things &s;o e&s;&s;ential &s;hould not be expo&s;ed to ri&s;k.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>INCLOSED you will receive a copy of a letter from me to lord Cornwallis, on the inhuman treatment of lieutenant Martin by a party of the enemy's hor&s;e. My remon&s;trance and &s;ending his corp&s;e produced nothing more than a &s;hort an|&s;wer from his lord&s;hip, which you al&s;o have. It was thought unne&s;&s;ary to view the body, the fact being admitted and ju&s;ti|fied.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o taken the liberty to inclo&s;e a copy of my letter
<PB N="77" REF="031423_0373_0FEC5D111F2868F0">
to general Howe, in an&s;wer to his of the twenty-fir&s;t of April, twenty-&s;econd of May, and fifth in&s;tant. From the latter part of the fir&s;t paragraph in that of the twenty-&s;econd of May, I was induced to propo&s;e an exchange of all the pri&s;oners now in his hands, &s;o far as it can be effected on the principles of the agreement &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between us, except that of lieutenant-colo|nel Campbell and the He&s;&s;ian field officers who are to be re|tained till general Lee is declared exchangeable. I did not expect the propo&s;ition would be acceded to: but, as his letter is of doubtful meaning in this in&s;tance, I thought it expedient to make the offer,&mdash;fir&s;t, as it will be a happy event if we re|lea&s;e our pri&s;oners,&mdash;and &s;econdly, as the propo&s;ition may draw from him an explanation of his &s;entiments, though he &s;hould re|ject it.</P>
<P>The New-York paper of the ninth in&s;tant I tran&s;mit for your peru&s;al: it contains an extract of a letter from governor Tryon to Chri&s;topher Billop of Long-I&s;land. This extract, I think, is worthy of attention, and may be improved to great advantage, if publi&s;hed in the papers with &s;uch &s;trictures and ob&s;ervations as it will well warrant, and as will occur to an in|genious pen. The enemy, on their part, u&s;e the mo&s;t artful pub|lications, and avail them&s;elves of every thing they can, going from us. We &s;hould profit, where we can, by their produc|tions.</P>
<P>I would mention to Congre&s;s that &s;everal officers in the corps of cavalry have applied to me, to know in what point of view their hor&s;es are con&s;idered,&mdash;Whether as public property, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> as private belonging to them&s;elves, to be furni&s;hed at their own expen&s;e. When colonel Sheldon's regiment was ordered to be rai&s;ed, the officers thought the hor&s;es &s;hould be a matter of pub|lic charge: but as it never had been determined, and I was not perfectly &s;atisfied with the cu&s;toms in &s;uch ca&s;es, I did not con|&s;ider my&s;elf authori&s;ed to decide upon it. I promi&s;ed to recom|mend it to the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s; and this I have done &s;ince on &s;imilar occa&s;ions. The officers urge, that, as hor&s;es are e&s;&s;ential to the di&s;charge of their duty, they &s;hould be pro|vided at the public expen&s;e; that they have ri&s;en to &s;uch enor|mous prices, that, if the contrary is e&s;tabli&s;hed, they mu&s;t, from the nature of the &s;ervice, not only &s;ink their pay, but make a large &s;acrifice of their privat&eacute; intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Though the practice may have been again&s;t their application in other armies, yet their rea&s;oning &s;eems plau&s;ible, and to be founded in ju&s;tice. There are objections too again&s;t the mea|&s;ure, but not of &s;ufficient validity, in my opinion, to oppo&s;e to
<PB N="78" REF="031423_0374_0FEC5D1A2EEDBBA0">
their claim. Another rea&s;on may be &s;ugge&s;ted, why the pub|lic &s;hould find them hor&s;es, which is, that if they were to pro|vide them them&s;elves, the apprehen&s;ion of lo&s;ing them might prevent a proper di&s;charge of duty, and in &s;ome ca&s;es pro|duce too great a degree of cautious prudence.</P>
<P>This matter I have thought it nece&s;&s;ary to lay before Con|gre&s;s, not doubting but it will have that attention which it may &s;eem to de&s;erve.&mdash;There is one thing more I would add upon the &s;ubject, which is if their application is con&s;idered ju&s;t, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e it be&s;t to fix a certain determinate &s;um to be al|lowed for the hor&s;es they have bought and may have occa&s;ion to purcha&s;e, in preference to leaving it to their di&s;cretion and judgment.</P>
<P>It being evident, &s;o far as we can rea&s;on from circum&s;tances and appearances, that general Howe de&s;igns Philadelphia to be the fir&s;t object of his pur&s;uit, or the defeat of this army,&mdash;and, for one or both of the&s;e purpo&s;es, is collecting nearly his whole force at Brun&s;wic,&mdash;a board of general officers determined ye&s;|terday evening after mature deliberation, that all the conti|nental troops at Peek&s;kill and its dependencies, except one thou&s;and effectives, &s;hould be immediately marched to reinforce this army. That number, with the convale&s;cents, and &s;uch aids of militia as are now and may be a&s;&s;embled in ca&s;e of e|mergency, was deemed competent to the defence of tho&s;e po&s;ts again&s;t any attempts that may be made to po&s;&s;e&s;s them in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of things.</P>
<P>I have inclo&s;ed a general return &s;hewing our whole &s;trength in Jer&s;ey at this time, from which it will appear our circum|&s;tances in this re&s;pect are by no means &s;o de&s;irable as could be wi&s;hed. I e&s;teem it my duty to tran&s;mit information of this &s;ort from time to time to Congre&s;s, and am encouraged the more to do it from a conviction that the, &s;en&s;ible of the nece&s;&s;ity of the mo&s;t profound &s;ecrecy, will not &s;uffer the lea&s;t intimation of our numbers to tran&s;pire.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 14.&mdash;Your fovor of the thirteenth, with its inclo|&s;ures, was received la&s;t night.</P>
<P>Having propo&s;ed to general Howe an exchange of the pri|&s;oners now in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, as you will perceive by the inclo|&s;ed copy of any letter, and al&s;o added, that, "<HI>his conduct to|wards pri&s;oners would govern mine,</HI>" it appears to me that it would be improper to tran&s;mit him a copy of your fir&s;t re&s;olu|tion of the tenth in&s;tant, till we have &s;omething more from him on the &s;ubject propo&s;ed. I confe&s;s I did not, nor do I yet, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n|der&s;tand the paragraph of his letter of the twenty-&s;econd ul|timo
<PB N="79" REF="031423_0375_0FEC5D1CAA270400">
to which I have alluded, and which induced me to propo&s;e an exchange if that was his wi&s;h, and to &s;ubjoin, that his con|duct to our pri&s;oners &s;hould govern mine,&mdash;as a caution to pre|vent him exerci&s;ing &s;everity on a new mode of treatment of them, contrary to the &s;pirit of the agreement between us, and the ideas entertained upon the &s;ubject when it was fir&s;t entered into,&mdash;if &s;uch was his meaning.</P>
<P>Finding that there would be great difficulty in filling the battalions intended to be rai&s;ed, I did not commi&s;&s;ion officers for all the &s;ixteen additional ones: I apprehend &s;uch a mea&s;ure would accumulate expen&s;e without increa&s;ing our &s;trength, and therefore did not &s;et the whole on foot.&mdash;I &s;hall be happy, on governor Co&s;well's letter and your recommendation of colonel Shephard, that he &s;hould have a regiment: from the character given him, and the terms on which he offers his &s;ervices, there can be no objection. Congre&s;s will be plea&s;ed to appoint him to the command they wi&s;h him to have; and I &s;hould think it advi&s;able that he be ordered to march with his corps to join this army, leaving proper officers to recruit the deficiency.</P>
<P>I have peru&s;ed mon&s;ieur De Coudray's opinion about the fortifications, and have no doubt but that it is well founded. I have not &s;ufficient knowledge of them to pronounce an opinion with certainty my&s;elf.</P>
<P>You will ob&s;erve by the New-York paper the execution of * * *. His family well de&s;erves the generous notice of Con|gre&s;s. He conducted him&s;elf with great fidelity to our cau&s;e, rendering [<HI>his country e&s;&s;ential</HI>] &s;ervices, and has fallen a &s;ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|fice in promoting her intere&s;t. Perhaps a public act of genero|&s;ity (con&s;idering the character he was in) might not be &s;o eligi|ble as a private donation.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 15.&mdash;When I wrote ye&s;terday, my information was that one divi&s;ion of the enemy was advancing on the Princeton road, and it was believed from the general movement of their army that they were proceeding towards Delaware. What their real de&s;ign was, is not yet under&s;tood. Tho&s;e that ad|vanced on the road, after marching &s;ome di&s;tance, filed off to the right down Mill&s;tone river, and joined the other column on the Coryel-ferry road leading by Somer&s;et court-hou&s;e. One object of their movement might be to inclo&s;e general Sullivan and his divi&s;ion between their two columns: another (which mo&s;t probable was the principal cau&s;e, if they did not mean to proceed to Delaware when they &s;et out) to manoeuvre us out of our pre&s;ent encampment into action upon di&s;advantageous terms. The fir&s;t they could not hope to &s;ucceed in after general Sulli|van
<PB N="80" REF="031423_0376_0FEC5D209E61ADF0">
changed his po&s;t to Rocky-Hill,&mdash;an event which took place on the evening before, and which it is pre&s;umed they were not well advi&s;ed of when they le&s;t Brun&s;wic. A con&s;i|derable body of them remain at Somer&s;et court-hou&s;e, and on the communication between that and Brun&s;wic.&mdash;We have been and are harra&s;&s;ing them with light-troops: but they being in open ground with a large train of artillery, we cannot do it &s;o effectually as could be we wi&s;hed.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be glad to be informed whether general De Haas con&s;iders him&s;elf an officer in the army. He has never joined it &s;ince his promotion, or written a &s;ingle line to me upon the &s;ubject. If he accepts his commmi&s;&s;ion it will be well for Con|gre&s;s to order him to repair to the army immediately. The brigade intended for him is without a general officer, and has brought on a di&s;agreeable di&s;pute between two of the colonels, each claiming the command. This is not the only inconveni|ence:&mdash;officers of high rank remaining at home afford a bad example to others who are inferior, and grounds of application for the like indulgence.</P>
<P>This letter, except the paragraphs of this date, I intended to &s;end ye&s;terday, but was prevented by the movement of the ene|my which rendered it unadvi&s;able.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I had the honor of addre&s;&s;ing you la&s;t, I informed you that the main body of the enemy had marched from Brun&s;|wic, and extended their van as far as Somer&s;et court-hou&s;e. I am now to acquaint you, that, after emcamping between the&s;e two po&s;ts and beginning a line of redoubts, they changed their ground ye&s;terday morning and in the cour&s;e of the preceding night, and returned to Brun&s;wic again, burning, as they went, &s;everal valuable dwelling hou&s;es. We had con&s;tantly light troops hovering round them as far as circum&s;tances would per|mit: but, being &s;ecured on their flanks by the Rariton and Mill&s;tone, they were difficult to approach; and, without lo&s;s, effected their return to their former po&s;ts. This &s;udden and precipitate change in their operations has afforded matter for much &s;peculation. We &s;uppo&s;e their original de&s;ign was to at|tempt an impre&s;&s;ion on our right, or to manoeuvre us out of our ground, or to advance towards the Delaware. Whether the&s;e conjectures were well founded, cannot be a&s;certained: but it is probable, if they had an impre&s;&s;ion in view, they found it could not be attempted without great lo&s;s&mdash;(as to bringing on an attack, they effectually &s;ecured them&s;elves again&s;t one by the po&s;t they took)&mdash;or if pa&s;&s;ing the Delaware was their object, that, from the temper of the people, the pro&s;e|cution of it (if not impracticable) would meet with much greater oppo&s;ition than what they expected: for I mu&s;t ob&s;erve,&mdash;and with peculiar &s;atisfaction I do it,&mdash;that, on the fir&s;t notice of the enemy's movements, the militia a&s;&s;embled in a mo&s;t &s;pirited manner, firmly determined to give them every annoyance in their power, and to afford us every po&s;&s;ible aid. This I thought it my duty to mention in ju&s;tice to their conduct; and I am inclined to believe that general Howe's return, thus &s;ud|denly made, mu&s;t have been in con&s;equence of the information he received that the people were in and flying to arms in every quarter to oppo&s;e him. I &s;hall not rea&s;on upon this event: but I cannot but con&s;ider it as a mo&s;t fortunate and happy one to us, and the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Mr. Howe has yet experienced, unle&s;s he has &s;chemes in contemplation beyond the reach of my con|jecture.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have written to Congre&s;s more frequently re&s;pecting the enemy after they came from Brun&s;wic, had I not been al|mo&s;t con&s;tantly on hor&s;e-back, and had their de&s;igns been clear: but as they were not, I did not wi&s;h to puzzle them with con|jectures, more e&s;pecially as I wrote general Arnold (with whom
<PB N="82" REF="031423_0378_0FEC5D2A8772D470">
I was obliged to corre&s;pond, that he might co-operate with me as circum&s;tances &s;hould require) to tran&s;mit them copies of my letters.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed you will be plea&s;ed to receive an extract of a letter from colonel Jack&s;on of Bo&s;ton to general Knox. The intelli|gence it contains is intere&s;ting; and I &s;hall be happy to hear that the two brigs mentioned have captured the remainder of the He&s;&s;ians, and more particularly &s;o if the capture &s;hould not be far from the Briti&s;h coa&s;t, provided they arrive &s;afe.</P>
<P><HI>Twelve o'clock.</HI>&mdash;I ju&s;t now received a letter from general S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uyler, a copy of which, and of its inclo&s;ures, is herewith tran&s;mitted.&mdash;The enemy, from appearances, having changed their views for the pre&s;ent, or at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ea&s;t rendered them dark and my&s;terious, I have &s;ent expre&s;&s;es to brigadiers M'Dougal and Glover to halt their divi&s;ions, if they have proceeded any con|&s;iderable di&s;tance from Peek&s;kill, till further orders,&mdash;otherwi&s;e to return. I have al&s;o written to general Putnam, to hold four regiments in readine&s;s to embark for general Schuyler's aid, &s;hould further intelligence from Canada re&s;pecting the enemy's movements make it nece&s;&s;ary. The uncertainty of general Howe's operations will not permit more to be done at this time. General Par&s;ons arrived here this morning, and his divi&s;ion is marching to their ground towards the left of the lines.</P>
<P>I omitted to mention in my la&s;t, that, in con&s;ultation with my general officers, it was agreed that promotions &s;hould be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">mental in the army for all officers under the rank of field-officers,&mdash;and for all of that rank, in the line of their &s;tate. This is now &s;ettled as a general rule; a right being re&s;erved however, that it may be made for patticular merit out of this line, or refu&s;ed for demerit or any &s;ub&s;tantial objection.</P>

<P>I HAVE the honor and plea&s;ure to inform you that the enemy evacuated Brun&s;wic this morning and retired to Am|boy, burning many hou&s;es as they went along. Some of them, from the appearance of the flames, were con&s;iderable buildings.</P>
<P>From &s;everal pieces of information and from a variety of cir|cum&s;tances it was evident that a movement was in agitation; and it was the general opinion that it was intended this morning. I therefore detatched three brigades under the command of major-general Greene to fall upon their rear, and kept the main body of the army paraded upon the heights, to &s;upport them if there &s;hould be occa&s;ion. A party of colonel Morgan's regiment of light infantry attacked and drove the He&s;&s;ian piquet about &s;un-ri&s;e: and, upon the appearance of ge|neral Wayne's brigade and Morgan's regiment (who got fir&s;t to the ground) oppo&s;ite Brun&s;wic, the enemy immediately cro&s;|&s;ed the bridge to the ea&s;t &s;ide of the river, and threw them|&s;elves into redoubts which they had before con&s;tructed. Our troops advanced bri&s;kly upon them; upon which they quitted the redoubts without making any oppo&s;ition, and retired by the Amboy road.</P>
<P>As all our troops, from the difference of their &s;tations in camp, had not come up when the enemy began to move off, it was impo&s;&s;ible to check them, as their numbers were far greater than we had any rea&s;on to expect,&mdash;being, as we were informed afterwards, between our and five thou&s;and men. Our men pur|&s;ued them as far as Pi&s;catawa: but finding it impo&s;&s;ible to over|take them, and fearing they might be led on to the main body, they returned to Brun&s;wic.</P>
<P>By information of the inhabitants, general Howe, lord Corn|wallis, and general Grant, were in the town when the alarm was fir&s;t given: but they quitted it very &s;oon after.</P>
<P>In the pur&s;uit, colonel Morgan's riflemen exchanged &s;everal &s;harp fires with the enemy, which, it is imagined, did con&s;idera|ble execution.&mdash;I am in hopes that they afterwards fell in with general Maxwell, who was detached la&s;t night with a &s;trong
<PB N="84" REF="031423_0380_0FEC5D2F0C2FB0A0">
party, to lie between Brun&s;wic and Amboy to intercept any convoys or parties that might be pa&s;&s;ing: but I have yet heard nothing from him.</P>
<P>General Greene de&s;ires me to make mention of the conduct and bravery of general Wayne and colonel Morgan, and of their officers and men, upon this occa&s;ion, as they con&s;tantly advan|ced upon an enemy far &s;uperior to them in numbers, and well &s;ecured behind &s;trong redoubts.</P>
<P>General Sullivan advanced from Rocky-Hill to Brun&s;wic with his divi&s;ion; but, as he did not receive his order of march till very late at night, he did not arrive till the enemy had been gone &s;ome time.</P>
<P>I have &s;ent down lord Sterling's divi&s;ion to reinforce general Maxwell; and in the morning I &s;hall move the main body of the army to &s;ome &s;ecure po&s;t nearer Amboy, from whence we can with more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> annoy the enemy, than from this di&s;tance.&mdash;I am inclined to think they mean to cro&s;s to Staten-I&s;land: if they do, we may perhaps find an opportunity of making a &s;troke upon their rear: at any rate we &s;hall have a chance of obliging them to make a total evacuation of the &s;tate of Jer&s;ey.&mdash;I have the honor to &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>When I had the honor to addre&s;s you la&s;t, it was on the &s;ubject of the enemy's retreat from Brun&s;wic to Amboy, and of the mea&s;ures pur&s;ued to annoy them. At the time of writ|ing, the information I had received re&s;pecting their lo&s;s was ra|ther vague and uncertain: but we have rea&s;on to believe, from intelligence through various channels &s;ince, that it was pretty con&s;iderable, and fell chiefly on the grenadiers and light infan|try who formed their covering party. The inclo&s;ed copy of a letter, containing the information of a per&s;on ju&s;t from New-York, corre&s;ponds with other accounts on this head, and with the declarations of &s;ome de&s;erters. Some of the accounts are, that officers were heard &s;o &s;ay they had not &s;uffered &s;o &s;everely &s;ince the affair at Princeton.</P>
<P>After the evacuation of Brun&s;wic, I determined, with the ad|vice of my general officers, to move the whole army the next morning to this po&s;t, where they would be nearer the enemy and might act according to circum&s;tances. In this I was pre|vented by rain, and they only moved ye&s;terday morning. I have advanced lord Sterling's divi&s;ion and &s;ome other troops

lower down in the neighbourhood of Metuchin meeting-hou&s;e, and intended to have po&s;ted more there; but found, on recon|noitring the ground, that it was low and di&s;advantageous, and &s;till more unfavourable through a &s;carcity of water. The&s;e rea|&s;ons, added to that of there not being the &s;malle&s;t pro&s;pect of attacking the enemy in Amboy with a probability of &s;ucce&s;s,&mdash;&s;ecured on their flanks by water, and in their front by &s;trong redoubts acro&s;s the Neck,&mdash;would not permit me, either in my own opinion or that of my general officers, to keep any greater body of men in that quarter, where they would have been di&s;|per&s;ed, and of con&s;equence extremely in&s;ecure.</P>
<P>I have light parties lying clo&s;e on the enemy's lines, to watch their motions, and who will be ready to act in conjuction with lord Sterling's divi&s;ion and &s;uch other troops as it may be nece&s;|&s;ary to detach; though I think,&mdash;and &s;o do the re&s;t of the offi|cers,&mdash;that no event is likely to take place that will require more, &s;ince the idea of forcing their lines, or bringing on a ge|nearl engagement on their own ground, is univer&s;ally held in|compatiable with our intere&s;t, and that that number is &s;ufficient to avail us of any advantages we can expect to ari&s;e from their retreating from Amboy, &s;uppo&s;ing notice of the fact &s;hould be obtained. Their contiguity to the Sound, and the &s;mall di&s;|tance acro&s;s it (having boats prepared to pa&s;s in), will enable them to get off (&s;hould they &s;o incline) again&s;t every prudent and ju&s;tifiable exertion on our part. Whether &s;uch is their de|&s;ign, is more than I can po&s;itively determine but there is every rea&s;on to believe that they have been and are tran&s;porting their baggage to Staten-I&s;land, and making every preparation to embark on board their tran&s;ports for &s;ome new expedition.</P>
<P>Your favour of the twenty-fourth I ju&s;t now received, and am extremely obliged by your cordial congratulations on the e|nemy's retreat from Brun&s;wic, and favorable interpretation of the event to my conduct.&mdash;The re&s;olution you did me the ho|nor to tran&s;mit &s;hall have my attention.</P>
<P>It is much to be regretted, that an expre&s;s &s;ent off to general Maxwell on &s;aturday night, to inform him of general Greene's movement towards Brun&s;wic that he might conduct him&s;elf ac|cordingly, did not reach him. Whether the expre&s;s went de|&s;ignedly to the enemy, or was taken, is not known: but there is rea&s;ons to believe he fell into their hands.

<P>ON thur&s;day morning general Howe advanced with his whole army in &s;everal columns, from Amboy, as far as We&s;t|field. We are certainly informed that the troops &s;ent to Stat|en-I&s;land returned the preceding evening, and, it is &s;aid, with an augmentation of marines, &s;o that carrying them there was a feint with intention to deceive us. His de&s;ign in this &s;udden movement was either to bring on a general engagement upon di&s;advantageous terms, con&s;idering matters in any point of view,&mdash;or to cut off our light parties, and lord Sterling's divi&s;ion which was &s;ent down to &s;upport them,&mdash;or to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of the heights and pa&s;&s;es in the mountains on our left. The two la&s;t &s;eemed to be the fir&s;t objects of his intention, as his march was rapid again&s;t the&s;e parties and indicated a &s;trong di&s;po&s;ition to gain tho&s;e pa&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation of affairs it was thought ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould move our force from the low grounds, to occupy the heights before them; which was effected. As they advan|ced, they fell in with &s;ome of our light parties and part of lord Sterling's divi&s;ion, with which they had &s;ome pretty &s;mart &s;kir|mi&s;hing, with but very little lo&s;s I believe on our &s;ide, except in three field-pieces which unfortunately fell into the enemy's hands; but, not having obtained returns yet, I cannot deter|mine it with certainty; nor can we a&s;certain what the enemy's lo&s;s was.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we had gained the pa&s;&s;es, I detached a body of light troops under brigadier-general Scott, to hang on their flank, and to watch their motions; and ordered Morgan's corps of riflemen to join him &s;ince.&mdash;The enemy remained at We&s;t|field till ye&s;terday afternoon, when, about three o'clock, they moved towards Spanktown, with our light troops in their rear and pur&s;uing. The enemy have plundered all before them, and it is &s;aid, burned &s;ome hou&s;es.</P>

<P>I HAVE not been able to a&s;certain yet with any degree of preci&s;ion the lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by the enemy in the &s;everal &s;kir|mi&s;hes on thur&s;day, though we have many rea&s;ons to believe it was much more con&s;iderable than what it was apprehended to be when I had the honor of addre&s;&s;ing you upon the &s;ubject. The inclo&s;ed copy of a letter from lord Stirling contains the fulle&s;t and mo&s;t particular information that I have received: and the accounts given by &s;undry inhabitants to per&s;ons who have been in the neighborhood where the &s;kirmi&s;hes were, and where the enemy were encamped, countenance this intelli|gence.</P>
<P>As to our lo&s;s, as reported by the enemy, I am per&s;uaded it is exaggerated beyond all bounds of truth or probability, be|ing a&s;&s;ured by lord Stirling that it was trifling,&mdash;and by &s;uch de&s;erters as have come in, that they &s;aw but very few pri&s;oners taken. It would have been certainly known before this (that is, the number not yet returned), had not &s;ome of the parties, and I believe the mo&s;t which were then out, joined the corps &s;ince detached.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to the enemy's de&s;igns or intended movements, they are not to be determined. It is certain they got into Am|boy ye&s;terday evening; and, from advices this morning from officers &s;ent to South-Amboy to ob&s;erve their motions, there were &s;trong rea&s;ons to conclude they were evacuating the town, as their hor&s;e had gone over to Staten-I&s;land, and as &s;everal boats were al&s;o pa&s;&s;ing with baggage, and others with troops. There were further circum&s;tances favoring this opinion, &s;uch as apparent breaches in &s;ome of their lines: yet general Sulli|van informs me by a letter ju&s;t now received, that, from all the intelligence he has been able to obtain to-day, he does not think they have any &s;erious intention of quitting it, and that all their movements are a feint, calculated merely to deceive, and to cover &s;ome plans they have in view.</P>
<P>I have two brigades,&mdash;Scott's and Conway's,&mdash;now lying at and near Woodbridge, as corps of ob&s;ervation, and to act as circum&s;tances may require. General Sullivan was down in the &s;ame neighborhood with his divi&s;ion, till this evening, when he returned, it appearing to him unnece&s;&s;ary to remain longer, and that the brigades I have mentioned would be &s;ufficient for any event likely to take place.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE inclo&s;ed copies of general St. Clair's letters, tran&s;|mitted ye&s;terday afternoon and la&s;t night by general Schuyler, I have thought it my duty to &s;end you. The intelligence they contain is important and intere&s;ting; nor are there circum&s;tan|ces
<PB N="89" REF="031423_0385_0FEC5D431A71C680">
wanting be&s;ides the&s;e, to induce a belief, or at lea&s;t to rai&s;e a &s;trong pre&s;umption, that the enemy have in contemplation a junction of their two armies by way of the lakes and the North-river. If they have their whole Canada force on the former, it is certainly their object.</P>
<P>On receiving the&s;e accounts, I wrote immediately to general Putnam to embark Nixon's brigade for reinforcing the northern army,&mdash;to wait however the arrival or near approach of gene|rals Par&s;ons and Varnum's brigades from this place, who march this morning,&mdash;or the coming in of an equal number of militia to &s;upply their place before they &s;ail. This I have done by the advice of my general officers, and is all that is thought prac|ticable in the pre&s;ent uncertain indeterminate &s;ituation of things. The re&s;t of the army here will be held in readine&s;s to move ac|cording to information and circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>As I have ob&s;erved, if we were certain general Burgoyne was approaching Ticonderoga with his whole army, I &s;hould not he&s;itate a moment in concluding that it is in con&s;equence of a preconcerted plan with general Howe, and that the latter is to co-operate with him, by pu&s;hing his whole force up the North-river, and aiming a &s;troke in the fir&s;t in&s;tance and imme|diately again&s;t the Highland pa&s;&s;es. But as the appearance of the enemy on the lake may be a feint calculated to amu&s;e and di&s;tract (though it may &s;eem like a real attack), to draw this army to Peek&s;kill and more to the northward, that general Howe may with more facility turn his arms again&s;t Philadel|phia,&mdash;it has been determined unadvi&s;able for us to move till we have further proofs of his intentions, and that our conduct mu&s;t be governed by his.</P>
<P>Our &s;ituation is truly delicate and embarra&s;&s;ing. Should we march to Peek&s;kill, leaving general Howe on Staten-I&s;land, there will be nothing to prevent him pa&s;&s;ing to South-Amboy, and pu&s;hing from thence to Philadelphia, or in &s;hort by any other route; though the marching &s;uch of his troops from the point oppo&s;ite Amboy as were encamped there, and the &s;ailing of the &s;hips from Prince&s;s-bay ye&s;terday morning, are circum|&s;tances indicating that an embarkation has or will take place. On the other hand, if the North-river and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Highlands are his objects, our remaining here till his views are certainly known may &s;ubject us to a ri&s;k that we wi&s;h to avoid.</P>
<P>Thus, let us examine matters as we will, difficulties &s;tare us in the face. We &s;hall attempt to con&s;ult, and to do the be&s;t we can.&mdash;I have written to generals Putnam and George Clin|ton
<PB N="90" REF="031423_0386_0FEC47A72B6878F8">
fully upon the &s;ubject, urging them to put forth every ex|ertion in their power, and in&s;tantly to call in a re&s;pectable body of militia to aid in the defence of tho&s;e important po&s;ts at this critical conjuncture. I tru&s;t they will come out: their &s;ervices in all probability will not be wanted but for a very &s;hort time.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t earne&s;tly reque&s;t that you will &s;end Mr. Stewart, the i&s;&s;uing commi&s;&s;ary-general, to camp immediately. There is rea&s;on to apprehend the army will be in great di&s;tre&s;s and con|fu&s;ion for want of i&s;&s;uing commi&s;&s;aries in three or four days. On &s;aturday, tho&s;e with Mr. Trumbull declare they will leave him, without they are put on a different footing from what they now are. I need not mention the con&s;equences that will re&s;ult from &s;uch an event, if there are not others here to &s;up|ply their places.</P>
<P>There is one thing more I would add, which is, that there are not more than forty thou&s;and dollars in the military che&s;t, and two months' pay due to all the army, except two or three regiments which have ju&s;t obtained warrants. A hundred and fifty-&s;ix thou&s;and, out of the la&s;t &s;upply &s;ent the payma&s;ter, I was obliged to order to Peek&s;kill for the troops in that quar|ter, who&s;e demands are great and pre&s;&s;ing al&s;o. I mu&s;t ear|ne&s;tly entreat that you will forward a &s;upply directly to the payma&s;ter:&mdash;&s;hould we be obliged to move before the troops are paid, much unea&s;ine&s;s and murmuring will be the certain attendants, and, I fear, &s;omething wor&s;e.</P>
<P>As the enemy will adopt every &s;tratagem and device to de|ceive and di&s;tract us,&mdash;notwith&s;tanding the pre&s;ent appearance in favor of their making an expedition up the North-river I doubt not but you will have the mo&s;t vigilant look-outs kept along Delaware-bay, and proper expre&s;&s;es and &s;ignals for com|municating the earlie&s;t intelligence. I think it would be high|ly expedient that &s;ome &s;en&s;ible judicious men &s;hould be em|ployed in that bu&s;ine&s;s at this time, who would view things as they ought to be, and from who&s;e accounts certain inferences and conclu&s;ions may be drawn, &s;o as to form a proper line for our conduct. The mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences may flow from fal&s;e information at this period: things &s;hould be examined with all po&s;&s;ible certainty. I &s;hall not be &s;urpri&s;ed to hear of &s;everal &s;hips appearing in or off Delaware, though general Howe's de&s;|tination &s;hould be el&s;ewhere. Their fleet give them the mo&s;t &s;ignal advantages, and an opportunity of practi&s;ing a thou&s;and feints.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I THIS morning received a letter of the &s;eventh in&s;tant from general Schuyler, a copy of which, and of its inclo&s;ure, I herewith &s;end you. The intelligence which they contain is truly intere&s;ting, &s;uppo&s;ing it ju&s;t: but it differs &s;o widely from what we had rea&s;on to expect from the accounts mentioned in general St. Clair's letters to general Schuyler (copies of which you would receive in his letter tran&s;mitted from hence la&s;t night by major Hoops) that I would fain flatter my&s;elf it is not true. I am the more encouraged to hope this, as captain Far|mam's letter from Fort-Ann to brigadier Learned &s;eems to be the foundation of the whole, and does not authori&s;e the unfa|vorable and unhappy conclu&s;ions built upon it. I &s;hould ra|ther &s;uppo&s;e, if any accident has befallen us, it mu&s;t have hap|pened to the detachment of men from the Grants, under colo|nel Warner: for we find from general St. Clair's letters, he expected &s;omething from him.&mdash;The whole account is &s;o con|fu&s;ed that we cannot e&s;tabli&s;h any certain deduction from it; and I &s;hall be happy if it proves premature and groundle&s;s.</P>
<P>I am told by a gentleman who came to camp ye&s;terday even|ing, that Nixon's brigade would certainly arrive at Albany on tue&s;day morning, as he &s;aw the ve&s;&s;els, in which it was em|barked &s;tanding up the evening before with a fair wind.</P>
<P>If the event mentioned by general Schuyler &s;hould not have happened, we cannot doubt but general Burgoyne has come up the lake, determined, if po&s;&s;ible, to carry his point,&mdash;I mean, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of our po&s;ts in that quarter, and to pu&s;h his arms further. Suppo&s;ing this not to have happened, as our continental levies are &s;o deficient in their number, our &s;ecurity and &s;afety will require that aids from the militia &s;hould be called forth in ca&s;es of emergency: if it has, there is now an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for their turning out to check general Bur|goyne's progre&s;s; or the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable con&s;equences may
<PB N="93" REF="031423_0389_0FEC5D4D384D5868">
be apprehended. Upon this occa&s;ion I would take the liberty to &s;ugge&s;t to Congre&s;s the propriety of &s;ending an active, &s;pi|rited officer, to conduct and lead them on. If general Arnold has &s;ettled his affairs, and can be &s;pared from Philadelphia, I would recommend him for this bu&s;ine&s;s, and that he &s;hould im|mediately &s;et out for the northern department: he is active, judicious, and brave, and an officer in whom the militia will repo&s;e great confidence. Be&s;ides this, he is well acquainted with that country, and with the routes and mo&s;t important pa&s;&s;es and defiles in it. I do not think he can render more &s;ignal &s;ervices, or be more u&s;efully employed at this time, than in this way. I am per&s;uaded his pre&s;ence and activity will animate the militia greatly, and &s;pur them on to a becoming conduct. I could wi&s;h him to be engaged in a more agreeable &s;ervice,&mdash;to be with better troops: but circum&s;tances call for his exertions in this way, and I have no doubt of his adding much to the honors he has already acquired.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the advices from general St. Clair, and the &s;trong probability there is that general Howe will pu&s;h again&s;t the Highland pa&s;&s;es to co-operate with general Bur|goyne, I &s;hall, by the advice of my officers, move the army from hence to-morrow morning towards the North-river. If &s;uch &s;hould be his intention, we &s;hall not be too early, as a fa|vorable wind and tide will carry him up in a few hours. On the other hand, if Philadelphia is his object, he connot get round before we can arrive there; nor can he well debark his troops &amp;c. and proceed acro&s;s the land, before we can oppo&s;e him.&mdash;I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</P>

<PB N="94" REF="031423_0390_0FEC5D52F93D84C8">
knew with certainty, have not become pri&s;oners: for I fear, from the di&s;po&s;ition they di&s;covered on this di&s;tre&s;&s;ing occa&s;ion; they would have &s;urrendered to the enemy, in ca&s;e they fell in with them, though inferior in number.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to general Schuyler's demands, it is not in my power to comply with the whole of them. Not a &s;ingle tent can be furni&s;hed: the kettles will be, and are ordered on; and an expre&s;s is going to Springfield for all the mu&s;ket-cartridges, &s;ixty barrels of powder, and a proportionable quantity of lead and cartridge-paper for his u&s;e. Ten pieces of artillery, with harne&s;s, are al&s;o ordered, with proper officers, from Peek&s;kill. I have written to him to procure hor&s;es and drivers him&s;elf, as they are to be obtained with much more ea&s;e where he is, than here: nor can he be &s;upplied with the heavy cannon which he reque&s;ts, &s;uppo&s;ing them nece&s;&s;ary,&mdash;not having one to &s;pare from a more important u&s;e,&mdash;the defence of the Highlands. Colonel Putnam, I imagine, will be with him before this, as his regiment is part of Nixon's brigade,&mdash;who will an&s;wer every purpo&s;e he can po&s;&s;ibly have for an engineer at this cri|&s;is. A &s;upply of intrenching tools was &s;ent him four or five days ago, in con&s;equence of an application then made.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be extremely happy if our &s;ituation would allow me to afford him a large reinforcement of men: but I cannot with any degree of propriety, in the opinion of my general officers, &s;end more to his aid at this time than a number of recruits on the march from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts &s;tate, belonging to &s;ome of the regiments under his command, who amount to &s;ix hundred at lea&s;t, and are now, I expect, pretty well advanced towards Peek&s;kill. With this augmentation to what he already has,&mdash;&s;uppo&s;ing general St. Clair and his force to have come in, and any number of his militia to have turned out,&mdash;he will have an army, equal if not &s;uperior to general Burgoyne's, from the only accounts we have obtained.&mdash;Be&s;ides this con&s;ideration, it is mo&s;t probable that general Burgoyne will &s;u&s;pend his opera|tions till general Howe makes a movement and an effort on his part. His de&s;igns, I think, are mo&s;t unque&s;tionably again&s;t the Highlands, and that he will attempt the execution as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>We have been prevented marching to-day by the rain; but, as &s;oon as the weather permits, &s;hall proceed as expeditiou&s;ly as we can towards the North-river, and cro&s;s or not, as &s;hall appear nece&s;&s;ary from circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>In my la&s;t I took the liberty of &s;ugge&s;ting the propriety of &s;ending an active officer to animate the militia that may a&s;&s;em|ble
<PB N="95" REF="031423_0391_0FEC5D5BD7534C58">
for checking general Burgoyne's progre&s;s, and mentioned general Arnold for that purpo&s;e. Being more and more con|vinced of the important advantages that will re&s;ult from his pre&s;ence and conduct, I have thought it my duty to repeat my wi&s;hes on the &s;ubject, and that he may without a moment's lo&s;s of time, &s;et out from Philadelphia for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>When this arrives, it is likely general Howe's intention will be well under&s;tood: but whether it is or not, as there are &s;trong rea&s;ons to believe his operations will be up the North-river and on the ea&s;t &s;ide of it, I &s;hall take the liberty to recommend the &s;ending on the North-Carolina and other continental troops at Philadelphia, to join this army, unle&s;s Congre&s;s have &s;ome information that a &s;outhern expedition is intended, of which I am not appri&s;ed.</P>
<P>If Congre&s;s have taken colonel Proctor and his corps into the &s;ervice of the &s;tates it will be expedient for them to come on with all the field-artillery which colonel Flowers the commi&s;&s;a|ry may have ready. This I have been induced to mention, ha|ving heard Congre&s;s were about to adopt them, and as our de|mand for artilleri&s;ts is great. I would al&s;o ob&s;erve that the &s;i|tuation of our affairs has become &s;o delicate and embarra&s;&s;ing by the late misfortune we have experienced, that it is much to be wi&s;hed &s;ome expedient could be come into, if there be any more efficacious than what has been already recommended, for filling and completing the &s;everal regiments. At pre&s;ent they only count in number, but not in force, being mo&s;t &s;hamefully defi|cient in their ju&s;t complement.</P>
<P>Your letter of the eighth was duly received; and, agreeable to your reque&s;t, I communicated to generals Greene and Knox the re&s;olution of Congre&s;s re&s;pecting them and general Sullivan, the la&s;t of whom I have not &s;een &s;ince it came to hand.</P>

<P>I WAS ye&s;terday evening honored with yours of the four|teenth.&mdash;I have heard nothing from the northward &s;ince my la&s;t.&mdash;I this day received advice from Staten-I&s;land, that, on &s;unday &s;eventy fall of the enemy's &s;hips fell down from the watering place to the Hook: but whether they have &s;ince gone out to &s;ea, I have not heard. Till I have more certain information of the &s;tate of our affairs to the northward, and of general Howe's real intentions I have concluded to halt the army at this place, from whence I can either march forward or return as circum|&s;tances may require.</P>
<P>If general Na&s;h &s;hould not have begun his march before this reaches you, be plea&s;ed to order him to proceed as far as Tren|ton only, and there wait my further orders. In ca&s;e he &s;hould have marched, be plea&s;ed to di&s;patch an expre&s;s after him with orders to halt at Trenton.</P>
<P>I am plea&s;ed to hear that you have taken colonel Proctor's corps of artillery into continental &s;ervice. You will be kind e|nough to order them to join the army immediately: for I ex|pect the light artillery in a few days from the ea&s;tward; and artillery-men will be wanted to man them.</P>
<P>I have no doubt but the militia from the we&s;tern parts of New-England will turn out to general Schuyler's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as I hope tho&s;e of this &s;tate and Jer&s;ey will to mine, &s;hould they be wanted.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be very happy if the committee of Congre&s;s can arrange the commi&s;&s;ary's department in &s;uch a manner as will &s;atisfy the officers concerned in the bu&s;ine&s;s, and at the &s;ame time &s;erve to

<P>I BEG leave to congratulate Congre&s;s on the captivity of major general Pre&s;cot and one of his aides. The particulars of this fortunate event you will find in the inclo&s;ed extract of a letter this minute received from general Spencer, which, I pre|&s;ume, are at large in the packet Mr. Greenleaf will deliver. Lieutenant-colonel Barton who conducted the enterpri&s;e, and the &s;mall handful under his command, have great merit. I &s;hall immediately propo&s;e to general Howe his exchange for that of major-general Lee, which if acceded to, will not only do away one ground of controver&s;y between general Howe and my&s;elf, but will relea&s;e lieutenant-colonel Campbell and the He&s;&s;ian field-officers, and procure the enlargement of an equal number of ours in his hands.</P>
<P>In mine of this morning I de&s;ired that colonel Proctor's re|giment &s;hould join this army without lo&s;s of time. Upon con|&s;ulting general Knox, we are of opinion they had better halt at Trenton with general Na&s;h till further orders, as the operations of general Howe are not yet perfectly under&s;tood.&mdash;I have nothing new from the northern department,&mdash;and only to add, that I have the honor to be, with great re&s;pect, &s;ir, your mo&s;t obedient &s;ervant,</P>

<SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE little notice I had of your coming to the army, and the &s;hortne&s;s of your &s;tay at camp, will more than probably oc|ca&s;ion the omi&s;&s;ion of many matters which of right ought to be laid before you; and the interruption, which my thoughts con|&s;tantly meet by a variety of occurrences, mu&s;t apologi&s;e for the crude and indige&s;ted manner in which they are offered.</P>
<P>The completion of the continental regiments is a matter of &s;uch infinite importance, that I think no means &s;hould be left une&s;&s;ayed to accompli&s;h it. Draughting, where the powers of government are adequate, would be the &s;peedie&s;t and mo&s;t effec|tual: but if it &s;hould be thought unadvi&s;able to attempt th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> mode,&mdash;next to it I would recommend that the bu&s;ine&s;s of re|cruiting &s;hould be taken entirely out of the hands of the offi|cers of the army, and that each &s;tate &s;hould appoint &s;ome per&s;on of known activity (one, for in&s;tance, who has been a good under|&s;heriff) in each county or town&s;hip, not only to recruit, but to apprehend de&s;erters;&mdash;the&s;e per&s;ons to be liberally rewarded for each recruit and de&s;erter whom they &s;hall deliver, at &s;tated periods and places, to officers appointed to receive, di&s;cipline, and march them to the army;&mdash;none of the&s;e recruiters to have the &s;malle&s;t power to act out of their own di&s;tricts, but to be ab&s;olutely fixed to them.</P>
<P>A mode of this kind would, in my humble opinion, be le&s;s burden&s;ome to the public than the pre&s;ent,&mdash;prevent the idle habits which recruiting officers contract, not only injurious to
<PB N="99" REF="031423_0395_0FEC5DBA4BFFC700">
them&s;elves, but to others.&mdash;the mo&s;t effectual means which can be devi&s;ed for the recovery of de&s;erters,&mdash;the &s;ure&s;t way of keeping your regiments of equal &s;trength, and of making the duty more equal in the detail of it: in a word many valuable advantages would re&s;ult from it, whil&s;t I can &s;ugge&s;t but one rea&s;on again&s;t it,&mdash;and that (fully &s;atisfied I am), when weigh|ed in the &s;cale of intere&s;t, will not operate,&mdash;I mean, the keep|ing &s;o many officers in camp, who might be &s;pared from the duties of the field till the regiments are &s;tronger than at pre&s;ent. The &s;ixteen additional regiments labor under &s;uch di&s;advantages in &s;ome &s;tates, as to render the interpo&s;ition of Congre&s;s, in &s;ome &s;hape or other, indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to food, con&s;idering we are in &s;uch an exten&s;ive and abundant country, no army was ever wor&s;e &s;upplied than ours with many e&s;&s;ential articles of it. Our &s;oldiers, the great|e&s;t part of la&s;t campaign and the whole of this, have &s;carcely ta&s;ted any kind of vegetables,&mdash;had but little &s;alt;&mdash;and vine|gar, which would have been a tolerable &s;ub&s;titute for vegeta|bles, they have been in a great mea&s;ure &s;trangers to. Neither have they been provided with proper drink: beer or cider &s;el|dom comes within the verge of the camp, and rum in much too &s;mall quantities. Thus, to devouring large quantities of animal food untempered by vegetables or vinegar, or by any kind of drink but water,&mdash;and eating indifferent bread (but for this la&s;t a remedy is provided),&mdash;are to be a&s;cribed the many putrid di&s;ea&s;es incident to the army, and the lamentable mortality that attended us la&s;t campaign. If the&s;e evils can be remedied, the expen&s;e and trouble ought not to be ob&s;tacles: though &s;ome kinds of vegetables are not to be had, others are, which to|gether with &s;our krout and vinegar, might ea&s;ily be had, if proper per&s;ons acquainted with the bu&s;ine&s;s were employed therein.</P>
<P>Soap is another article in great demand. The continental allowance is too &s;mall: and, dear as every nece&s;&s;ary of life is now got, a &s;oldier's pay will not enable him to purcha&s;e; by which means his con&s;equent dirtine&s;s adds not a little to the di&s;ea&s;es in the army.</P>
<P>I have no rea&s;on to accu&s;e the clothier-general of inattention to his department; and therefore, as his &s;upplies are incompe|tent to the wants of the army, I am to &s;uppo&s;e his re&s;ources are unequal. Ought not each &s;tate then to be called upon to draw &s;uch &s;upplies from the country manufactories, as can be afford|ed? particularly of &s;hoes, &s;tockings, &s;hirts and blankets,&mdash;arti|cles indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary, and of which &s;carce too many can
<PB N="100" REF="031423_0396_0FEC5DBBD8E4E108">
be provided:&mdash;in the mean while, every provi&s;ion to be mak|ing, for clothing the troops uniformly and warm in the winter. It is a maxim which needs no illu&s;tration, that nothing can be of more importance in an army, than the clothing and feeding it well. On the&s;e the health, comforts, and &s;pirits of the &s;ol|diers e&s;&s;entially depend; and it is a melancholy fact, that the American army are mi&s;erably defective in both the&s;e re&s;pects. The di&s;tre&s;s mo&s;t of them are in for want of clothing is painful to humanity, di&s;piriting to them&s;elves, and di&s;couraging to every officer. It makes every preten&s;ion to the pre&s;ervation of cleanline&s;s impo&s;&s;ible, expo&s;es them to a variety of di&s;orders, and abates or de&s;troys that military pride, without which no|thing can be expected from any army.</P>
<P>The con&s;equence of giving rank indi&s;criminately is much to be dreaded: great di&s;&s;atisfaction has already ari&s;en on account of be&s;towing this on officers of the civil departments of the army, on the inferior &s;taff, waggon-ma&s;ter, &amp;c. who, by cu&s;tom, pro|priety, and every other motive, are excluded from it in all well-regulated armies. The too great liberality practi&s;ed in this re&s;pect will de&s;troy the pride of rank where it ought to exi&s;t, and will not only render it cheap, but contemptible. It is the policy of all armies to make it valued and re&s;pected, as a &s;timulus to emulation, and an incitement to bold and gallant undertakings: it mu&s;t be very unadvi&s;able therefore, in our in|fant &s;tate of war, to adopt novel cu&s;toms to bring it into di&s;|credit,&mdash;which mu&s;t and will be the con&s;equence of making it too common, be&s;ides the di&s;gu&s;t it creates in others.</P>
<P>An auditor of accounts, to be con&s;tantly with the army, is ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite. It is impo&s;&s;ible for me, crowded as I am with other bu&s;ine&s;s, to examine and adju&s;t the numerous com|plex accounts of the army with that correctne&s;s the public have a right to expect, before warrants pa&s;s for payment; and with|out doing it, great impo&s;itions may follow. The provi&s;ion for making regimental payma&s;ters regulate all regimental accounts is altogether incompetent to the end propo&s;ed from it: for the&s;e men being appointed generally agreeable to the recom|mendation of the field-officers of the regiments they belong to, a&s;&s;ociating con&s;tantly with the officers of their corps, and in a great mea&s;ure under their controul,&mdash;cannot be con&s;idered as &s;ufficiently uninfluenced: nor are auditors at a di&s;tance from the army of much u&s;e, as it would require a delay not admi&s;&s;i|ble, to &s;end accounts to them to audit before they were pa&s;&s;ed and paid in con&s;equence of warrants from the commander-in-chief of the army.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="031423_0397_0FEC5DBE2511BF00">
A good geographer, to &s;urvey the roads and take &s;ketches of the country where the army is to act, would be extremely u&s;e|ful, and might be attended with exceeding valuable con&s;equen|ces. He might with propriety have the chief direction of the guides, and mu&s;t have a head to procure, govern, and pay them. If &s;uch a per&s;on &s;hould be approved of, I would beg leave to recommend Mr. Robert Er&s;kine, who is thoroughly &s;killed in this bu&s;ine&s;s, has already a&s;&s;i&s;ted us in making maps of the country, and has (as I am informed) uniformly &s;upported the character of a fa&s;t friend to America.</P>
<P>A &s;mall travelling pre&s;s, to follow head-quarters, would be productive of many eminent advantages. It would enable us to give &s;peedy and exact information of any military tran&s;ac|tions that take place, with proper comments upon them, and thereby fru&s;trate the pernicious tendency of fal&s;ehood and mi&s;|repre&s;entation, which, in my opinion,&mdash;of whatever complexion they may be,&mdash;are, in the main, detrimental to our cau&s;e. If the people had a channel of intelligence, that, from its u&s;ual authenticity, they could look up to with confidence, they might often be pre&s;erved from that de&s;pondency which they are apt to fall into from the exaggerated pictures our enemies and their emi&s;&s;aries among us commonly draw of any misfortunes we meet with,&mdash;and from that diffidence of truths favorable to us, which they mu&s;t naturally feel from the frequent deception they are expo&s;ed to by the extravagant colorings our friends often give to our &s;ucce&s;&s;es. It would al&s;o be very u&s;eful to di&s;patch bu&s;ine&s;s in camp, being the mo&s;t expeditious means of taking copies of orders or other matters that require to be di&s;|per&s;ed, and would &s;ave a good deal in returns and other papers we are often obliged to get printed in Philadelphia. An in|genious man, to accompany this pre&s;s and be employed wholly in writing for it, might render it &s;ingularly beneficial.</P>
<P>I am exceedingly embarra&s;&s;ed how to di&s;po&s;e of the French officers in general, but more e&s;pecially the artillery officers who are come out under the &s;anction of a compact. I can think of no other way than that of forming a &s;eparate corps of them, and draughting men from the whole line to compo&s;e that corps: but even this will be attended with many di&s;agreeable effects:&mdash;among others this is not the lea&s;t, that officers will think them&s;elves much injured to have the men they have had the trouble of rai&s;ing, taken from them and given to others. There is &s;omething in this which is di&s;couraging, and breaks the &s;pirit of a good officer who prides him&s;elf in having a full and complete corps.</P>

<P>WE have been under great embarra&s;&s;ments re&s;pecting the intended operations of general Howe, and &s;till are, notwith&s;tand|ing the utmo&s;t pains to obtain intelligence of the &s;ame. At pre&s;ent it would appear that he is going out to &s;ea. By au|thentic information, there are only forty &s;hips at New-York; the re&s;t are gone el&s;ewhere, and have fallen down between the Narrows and the Hook: between the&s;e two places, the number, from the mo&s;t accurate ob&s;ervation, was about one hundred and twenty ye&s;terday. As I ob&s;erved before, their de&s;tination is uncertain and unknown: but I have thought it my duty to in|form Congre&s;s of the&s;e facts, that they may give orders to the militia to hold them&s;elves in readine&s;s to march on the &s;horte&s;t notice, in ca&s;e Philadelphia &s;hould be their object.

<P>As the enemy will probably make many feints, and have it unhappily but too much in their power from their &s;hipping, I would advi&s;e that the look-outs &s;hould be cautioned to be ex|tremely accurate in their ob&s;ervations and reports, mentioning with as much preci&s;ion as po&s;&s;ible, the number of &s;hips that may appear.&mdash;Our &s;ituation is already critical, and may be ren|dered &s;till more &s;o by inaccurate and ill-grounded intelligence.</P>

<P>I DO my&s;elf the honor to tran&s;mit you a copy of my let|ter to general Howe, of the &s;ixteenth in&s;tant, propo&s;ing an ex|change between generals Lee and Pre&s;cot. I di&s;patched it ear|ly the next morning, and pre&s;ume it got to hand on the eigh|teenth. As yet I have not received his an&s;wer.</P>
<P>The amazing advantage the enemy derive from their &s;hips and the command of the water, keeps us in a &s;tate of con&s;tant perplexity and the mo&s;t anxious conjecture. We are not yet informed of their de&s;tination, nor can any plau&s;ible conclu&s;ions be drawn re&s;pecting it, at lea&s;t not &s;uch as appear &s;atisfactory. What renders the matter &s;till more difficult and confu&s;ed, is their extreme inactivity and delay: for it is certain they began to embark immediately after the evacuation of Amboy, and now remain between the Narrows and the Hook, or were there when I was la&s;t advi&s;ed upon the &s;ubject. I have two active officers, with an e&s;cort, now out for the purpo&s;e of intelligence, and for reconnoitring their &s;ituation from Fort-Lee and along the river in that neighborhood.</P>
<P>Things being thus circum&s;tanced, and various opinions, as to their real object, prevailing among us,&mdash;&s;ome &s;uppo&s;ing it to be Philadelphia, others the North-river, and others an expedition more ea&s;terly,&mdash;I would &s;ubmit it to Congre&s;s whether the mi|litia of the neighbouring counties &s;hould not be immediately called to the fir&s;t, or at Che&s;ter,&mdash;the lower counties, at Wil|mington. This mea&s;ure appears to me highly expedient, and no objection can lie again&s;t it, of &s;ufficient validity to prevent it, as a few days mu&s;t certainly determine their real de&s;igns.&mdash;Should they be again&s;t Philadelphia, and they have favorable winds, their voyage may be made in a &s;hort time, when it may be too late to obtain their aid, and to arrange them properly for defence, &s;uppo&s;ing them to come in. I am the more induc|ed to recommend this mea&s;ure, as the &s;everal objects we have to attend to nece&s;&s;arily oblige this army to continue at a con&s;i|derable di&s;tance from that place till their intentions are better under&s;tood; and as they might by a &s;udden and rapid pu&s;h at|tempt
<PB N="105" REF="031423_0401_0FEC5DCEF35F7570">
to effect &s;ome material capital &s;troke before we could get there, unle&s;s there is a re&s;pectable force to oppo&s;e them: for, though no great dependence can be put in a militia acting alone, nor a vigorous oppo&s;ition expected from them (from the nature of things) to a di&s;ciplined, well-appointed army, yet their ope|rations may be greatly retarded by them, and may be checked till other &s;uccours arrive. The report of a force, e&s;pecially if it is in any wi&s;e re&s;pectable, let it be of what &s;ort it may, will have &s;ome influence on their conduct, and may prevent enterpri&s;es that would otherwi&s;e be undertaken.</P>
<P>From the intelligence we received on &s;aturday evening, that a number of the enemy's &s;hips were &s;tanding up the North-river,&mdash;and in the cour&s;e of that and the preceding day, that forty &s;ail were in the Sound, going into Fairfield harbour,&mdash;I had not the lea&s;t doubt in my mind but general Howe had in view a &s;troke again&s;t the Highlands and the fortifications there, and to co-operate with general Burgoyne. In con&s;equence of the&s;e advices I judged it expedient to move the army the next morn|ing, from our then encampment, towards tho&s;e po&s;ts. Lord Stirling's divi&s;ion was ordered to take the route to King's-fer|ry, and to pa&s;s the river to Peek&s;kill; and I proceeded my&s;elf with the remainder, which compo&s;ed the main body, by the route leading through the Clove towards New-Wind&s;or. We marched over a very difficult and rugged road till night, when we halted,&mdash;the fir&s;t divi&s;ion having advanced about eighteen miles. In this &s;ituation we lay till ye&s;terday morning, when, from the information received before re&s;pecting the enemy's fleet being at or near the Hook, and no further accounts of the &s;hips in the Sound, a change in our mea&s;ures took place. Ste|phen and Lincoln's divi&s;ions were ordered to proceed to Che&s;|ter, (there to wait further directions, as a place from whence they may move with much more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;e either to Philadelphia or Hud&s;on's river, being &s;even miles nearer the former, and equal|ly convenient to the latter) and general Greene's divi&s;ion to this ground. By dividing, and this arrangement, I am in hopes our movements will be more expeditious, where&s;oever they may be nece&s;&s;ary.</P>

I was the more inclined to this &s;tep, as the nearne&s;s of the army to the city,&mdash;be&s;ides other di&s;advantages, afforded a temptation both to officers and men, to indulge them|&s;elves in licences incon&s;i&s;tent with di&s;cipline and order, and con|&s;equently of an injurious tendency.</P>

<P>It is generally a well-founded maxim, that we ought to endea|vour to reduce our defence as much as po&s;&s;ible to a certainty by collecting our &s;trength and making all the preparations at one point, rather than to ri&s;k its being weak and ineffectual every where, by dividing our force and attention to different objects:&mdash;in doing this we may di&s;able our&s;elves from acting with &s;uffi|cient vigor any where, and a misfortune in one place may pave the way for a &s;imilar one in another. In our circum&s;tances we have neither men, cannon, nor any thing el&s;e to &s;pare, and per|haps cannot with propriety hazard them on objects, which be|ing attended with the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s we can promi&s;e our&s;elves, can be productive of only partial and indeci&s;ive advantages, and which may po&s;&s;ibly fail of the end propo&s;ed,&mdash;may have &s;ome &s;erious ill con&s;equences,&mdash;and mu&s;t at all events have &s;ome di&s;advantages.</P>
<P>It is then to be con&s;idered where our defence can be mo&s;t effectually made,&mdash;whether at Billing&s;port or at Fort-I&s;land.&mdash;It appears to me that the la&s;t de&s;erves greatly the preference: Billing&s;port has but one row of chevaux-de-fri&s;e: Fort-I&s;land has three, and, in addition to them, a boom, and another che|vaux-de-fri&s;e ready to be &s;unk in the channel on the approach of the enemy: of cour&s;e the ob&s;tructions, in this re&s;pect, are four times as great at the one as at the other. The gallies and floating batteries that could be brought for the defence of the chevaux-de-fri&s;e at Billing&s;port would be unable to maintain
<PB N="112" REF="031423_0408_0FEC5DF12E433F18">
their &s;tation when once the enemy were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the commanding ground on the Jer&s;ey &s;ide, to which they would be entirely expo&s;ed; and, notwith&s;tanding the works rai&s;ing there,&mdash;even &s;uppo&s;ing them complete,&mdash;the &s;tronge&s;t advo|cates for making our defence in this place do not pretend that the event can be protracted more than fifteen or twenty days at mo&s;t; at the end of which time, we &s;hould be obliged, with the lo&s;s of our cannon at lea&s;t, to abandon the defence, and leave it in the power of the enemy to remove or de&s;troy the chevaux de-fri&s;e at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Nor is it by any means certain that a &s;ingle row of chevaux-de-fri&s;e would be an impenetrable barrier to the enemy's &s;hips:&mdash;experiments have been made, that lead to a contrary &s;uppo|&s;ition; and if they &s;hould hazard one (which it might be well worth their while to do with their le&s;s valuable &s;hips) under favor of a leading breeze and tide, and &s;hould &s;ucceed in it,&mdash;the con&s;equence might be the lo&s;s of our gallies and floating batteries, which I apprehend might be intercepted, and (with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their gallies and &s;mall armed ve&s;&s;els) taken: and this would greatly weaken the oppo&s;ition we might other|wi&s;e give at Fort-I&s;land, and tend powerfully to render it abor|tive.</P>
<P>But if they &s;hould not attempt this, contenting them&s;elves with &s;afer though &s;lower operations, I have already ob&s;erved that it is agreed on all hands, in fifteen or twenty days they would be able to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of infallible means of fru&s;tra|ting our oppo&s;ition there by the capture of our works. And if we add to this that it might very po&s;&s;ibly happen in le&s;s time,&mdash;if from no other cau&s;e, yet from the garri&s;on being intimidated by a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of its own inferiority and inability to &s;upport it&s;elf again&s;t a &s;o much &s;uperior force of numbers, which might occa&s;ion a conduct de&s;tructive to it&s;elf,&mdash;there will remain no &s;ufficient rea&s;ons to ju&s;tify the making of this the principal point of defence.</P>
<P>At Fort-I&s;land, the boom and chevaux-de-fri&s;e are an ample &s;ecurity again&s;t any forcible impre&s;&s;ion of the enemy's &s;hips, which it would be imprudent for them to attempt.&mdash;On the Jer&s;ey &s;ide, the &s;ituation of the ground is &s;uch, that the gallies, floating batteries, and forts, employed in the defence of the ob&s;tructions, would have little to fear from any batteries, erect|ed there. Red-bank &s;eems by its elevation to be the only ad|vantageous &s;pot for annoying them: but as it is computed to be above nineteen hundred yards from Fort-I&s;land, the di&s;tance is rather too great to allow any battery rai&s;ed there to act with
<PB N="113" REF="031423_0409_0FEC5DF2C380FCE8">
&s;uch effect as to be able to &s;ilence our fire.&mdash;On this &s;ide, the ground, by dikes and &s;luices, may be laid under water to &s;o con|&s;iderable an extent as to leave no danger of our river force be|ing annoyed from thence; for which purpo&s;e &s;uitable prepara|tions ought at once to be made, again&s;t it be nece&s;&s;ary to carry them in effect.</P>
<P>But though a battery upon Red-bank would not. in my appre|hen&s;ion, be able to prevent the efficacy of our defence, or give any material di&s;turbance to Fort-I&s;land in particular, yet it might &s;erve to make the &s;ituation of &s;ome of our gallies rather unea&s;y; and this perhaps makes it worth while to pre-occupy it in order to keep it out of the enemy's hands, erecting a &s;mall but &s;trong work there, capable of containing about two hundred men; with &s;ix or eight pieces of light cannon and a proportionable quantity of &s;tores. As the approaches to it are difficult on ac|count of the adjacent creeks, and a communication can be kept open between it and our army,&mdash;by which means the garri&s;on might receive &s;uccours from time to time,&mdash;though we could not expect to make it impregnable, yet we &s;hould have a pro&s;|pect of holding it much longer than we could the works at Billing&s;port. In the po&s;ition, which, from my pre&s;ent view of it, I &s;hould think it be&s;t for our army to take, the left wing of it would be nearly oppo&s;ite to Red-bank, and therefore in a condition to relieve and &s;upport it;&mdash;whereas Billing&s;port being more remote from the probable po&s;ition of the army, and de|tached from any other work, could not ea&s;ily derive any a&s;|&s;i&s;tance from without, and mu&s;t rely wholly upon its own &s;trength.</P>
<P>Either at Billing&s;port or at Fort-I&s;land, I believe there is not much to be apprehended from the fire of the enemy's &s;hips unaided by land batteries: for, as by the information of tho&s;e who ought to be acquainted with the fact, not more than three &s;hips can act a-brea&s;t at a time at either place,&mdash;and as the gal|lies, not requiring the &s;ame depth of water, can extend them|&s;elves at plea&s;ure, and be&s;ides carry a &s;uperior weight of metal to that which frigates commonly have,&mdash;a much &s;uperior fire could be oppo&s;ed to them than any they could bring, and (from the difference of &s;ize and make between the frigates and gallies) to much better effect than theirs. The comparative extent of the river at Billing&s;port and at Fort-I&s;land has been a&s;&s;igned as a motive preferable to the former,&mdash;the river being narrower there than at the latter, and &s;uppo&s;ed to admit of fewer &s;hips operating at a time: but as it is a&s;&s;erted by the gentlemen i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the river department, that the &s;and-banks and &s;hallowne&s;s of
<PB N="114" REF="031423_0410_0FEC5DFA32F9AAD8">
the river in mo&s;t places near Fort-I&s;land compen&s;ate for the width of it, and make it impo&s;&s;ible for more than three &s;hips to act together at a time,&mdash;this rea&s;on for preferring the po&s;ition at Billing&s;port &s;eems to have no foundation. And if we con&s;i|der that our whole force of gallies and floating batteries would be collected at Fort-I&s;land, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the fort it&s;elf,&mdash;and that it would not be &s;afe to tru&s;t them all out for the defence of Billing&s;port for fear of the di&s;a&s;ter already &s;ugge&s;ted,&mdash;it &s;eems evident enough that this is the place where our defence may be mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sfully made.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t weighty con&s;iderations with me is that our army, as before intimated, could more conveniently co-operate with the defence by water here than at Billing&s;port. The ground on this &s;ide is better &s;ituated here than at the other place: and the army being &s;o much nearer the city, it is &s;o much the le&s;s likely that the enemy &s;hould be able, by a cir|cuitous route, to fall into the rear of it, and &s;eparate it from the city,&mdash;which is a circum&s;tance that ought carefully to be at|tended to.</P>
<P>Some gentlemen are of opinion that our principal dependence ought to be upon Fort-I&s;land and its appendages; but at the &s;ame time, that we &s;hould make a part of our defence at Bil|ling&s;port,&mdash;propo&s;ing, for that purpo&s;e, that the works there &s;hould be continued on the new contracted &s;cale, to be garri|&s;oned by four or five hundred men. The rea&s;ons for this are, that it would &s;erve to delay the enemy, and give our army time to come up, &s;hould it be at any di&s;tance,&mdash;and that it would prevent tho&s;e di&s;agreeable impre&s;&s;ions which never fail to accompany the abandoning works that have been once rai&s;|ed, and plans that have been once in execution, e&s;pecially when the per&s;ons concerned in the defence of them repo&s;e a degree of confidence in them,&mdash;which is &s;aid to be the ca&s;e in the pre|&s;ent in&s;tance.</P>
<P>But the&s;e rea&s;ons may perhaps not be &s;o conclu&s;ive as it is imagined: for it is a que&s;tion, whether, if our army was &s;o re|mote as to make &s;uch a delay nece&s;&s;ary, the enemy would em|barra&s;s them&s;elves with removing the water ob&s;tructions in the fir&s;t place, but would not rather debark and make a rapid march by land, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them&s;elves of the city, and of tho&s;e po&s;itions which would make the &s;urrender of the gallies, &amp;c. in &s;ome &s;ort a natural con&s;equence. And it is worthy of con&s;ideration whether the abandoning the works begun at this time, which will probably allow &s;ome lei&s;ure for any di&s;agreeable impre&s;&s;ions it might make to be effaced, will not be le&s;s injurious than the
<PB N="115" REF="031423_0411_0FEC5D85D99FF790">
abandoning them hereafter when they have co&s;t more expence, time, and labor, and in the critical moment of an attack, when every misfortune, and the lo&s;s of the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable po&s;t, is too apt to have a much wor&s;e influence on the mind, than the real importance of it will ju&s;tify.</P>
<P>Add to this the po&s;&s;ibility that the garri&s;on, di&s;mayed at the approach of numbers &s;o &s;uperior to their own, might not an|&s;wer the end expected from them, and might even be lo&s;t by their timidity;&mdash;the certainty of lo&s;ing the cannon after the time limited for the defence, and thereby weakening that of the upper po&s;ition;&mdash;the chance of lo&s;ing the gallies and float|ing batteries requi&s;ite for covering the chevaux-de-fri&s;e, by a hazardous and &s;ucce&s;sful attempt to break through them,&mdash;and the garri&s;on with them, which would fall of cour&s;e upon &s;uch an event.&mdash;It is however &s;ubmitted to Congre&s;s to balance the advantages and di&s;advantages, and determine accordingly. I would only beg leave to give it clearly as my opinion that our principal dependence ought to be upon Fort-I&s;land and the ob&s;tructions there, and that Billing&s;port ought not by any means to be defended more than as a &s;econdary object: and, to that end, I would recommend that the works on Fort-I&s;land, which, on their pre&s;ent con&s;truction, are by no means calcu|lated for the defence of the chevaux-de-fri&s;e,&mdash;be immediately altered and adapted to that purpo&s;e, taking care at the &s;ame time to make them defen&s;ible with a &s;mall number of men again&s;t any &s;udden attempt to land in boats and carry them by a&s;&s;ault.</P>
<P>But, whatever &s;cheme is pur&s;ued, I could wi&s;h the greate&s;t diligence and di&s;patch may be u&s;ed in bringing it to maturity: for, though the danger which lately threatened &s;eems to have &s;ub&s;ided, there is no knowing how &s;oon it may return: and certainly it will be prudent to do every thing in our power to be prepared for it, as we can lo&s;e nothing by being &s;o, and may lo&s;e a great deal by neglecting to improve the interval of lei|&s;ure they have given us, &s;hould it be their intention to revi&s;it this quarter. As the means to this, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to fur|ni&s;h Mr. Coudray, to whom the &s;uperintendency of tho&s;e works is intru&s;ted, with a competent number of workmen, tools, and what other things he may want, to enable him to carry them on with propriety, ea&s;e, and expedition.</P>
<P>On the whole, I am of opinion that the ob&s;tructions in the river, with the help of gallies, floating batteries, and with to|lerable indu&s;try to put the land works in a proper &s;tate, will be extremely formidable to the enemy, and authori&s;e a rea&s;onable
<PB N="116" REF="031423_0412_0FEC5DFDF08D2360">
expectation of their being effectual. The fire-&s;hips al&s;o will contribute to this end: for though there are many ob&s;tacles to render their &s;ucce&s;s precarious, and a happy concurrence of circum&s;tances is nece&s;&s;ary towards it,&mdash;any of which failing may di&s;appoint the project,&mdash;and there is therefore no room to be &s;anguine, yet there is &s;ome probability of its &s;ucceeding; and they will be at lea&s;t an embarra&s;&s;ment and terror to the enemy, and will oblige them to u&s;e precautions inconvenient to them, and &s;erviceable to us.</P>
<P>As an accurate knowledge of the country is e&s;&s;ential to a good defence,&mdash;and as the enemy's approach may be &s;udden, and we may be called to act, without having time, when it happens, to examine it &s;ufficiently if it is not done beforehand, it would an&s;wer a valuable purpo&s;e to have it immediately carefully reconnoitred, and &s;ketches taken of all the landing-places, great roads, and by-paths, encamping grounds, heights, rivers, creeks, mora&s;&s;es, and every thing that it can be of any importance to know. Marcus-Hook &s;eems to be the mo&s;t ad|vanced place at which it is conjectured the enemy will land: the &s;urvey &s;hould therefore comprehend all the country be|tween that and Philadelphia. Mon&s;ieur Du Coudray has of|fered his &s;ervice, with his engineers, to do this bu&s;ine&s;s, if au|thori&s;ed by Congre&s;s, only requiring that they may be &s;upplied with hor&s;es and a hand or two. If Congre&s;s approve of it, I &s;hall be glad they may be de&s;ired to enter upon it without lo&s;s of time.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MONSIEUR Du Coudray has laid before me a plan of the river, by which it appears that, for a con&s;iderable &s;pace be|tween the two &s;and banks on the ea&s;t &s;ide of Fort-I&s;land, there is from four to four and a half fathoms depth of water. Ac|cording to this repre&s;entation, there would be room for three frigates to lie between tho&s;e banks in &s;uch a po&s;ition as to enfi|lade the works at Fort-I&s;land, and make it difficult to maintain them.</P>
<P>There are but two ways of remedying this inconvenience;&mdash;one by having a &s;ufficient number of chevaux-de-fri&s;e &s;unk at the entrance between the two banks;&mdash;and the other by having the left flank of Fort-I&s;land fortification &s;upported by a good battery capable of re&s;i&s;ting the cannon of the &s;hips, and obliging them to quit their &s;tation. The fir&s;t is evidently preferable, becau&s;e the efficacy of it will be more certain. A few che|vaux-de-fri&s;e properly placed might effectually bar all acce&s;s to the &s;hips: but there is a po&s;&s;ibility that any battery we can con&s;truct might be overpowered by the fire of the &s;hipping: and as we have few cannon, and Fort-I&s;land is it&s;elf a mar&s;hy &s;pot, incapable of affording earth for the batteries nece&s;&s;ary to be rai&s;ed upon it, which mu&s;t be brought from the oppo&s;ite &s;hore,&mdash;it would not be prudent to multiply works there more than cannot be avoided. It would al&s;o be a great advantage gained, to &s;ecure the i&s;land from annoyance except in one point,
<PB N="118" REF="031423_0414_0FEC5E09D3AB7A08">
and that in front, from only three &s;hips at at a time,&mdash;which would be effected by &s;topping up the pa&s;&s;age between the two banks with the chevaux-de-fri&s;e. I &s;hould therefore think it of importance to have this mea&s;ure immediately adopted and carried into execution.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DO my&s;elf the honor of addre&s;&s;ing a few lines to Con|gre&s;s on a &s;ubject which appears to me of infinite importance, and to have a claim in their &s;erious attention. The matter I allude to is the exorbitant price exacted by merchants and ven|ders of good for every nece&s;&s;ary they di&s;po&s;e of. I am &s;en&s;ible the trouble and ri&s;k in importing give the adventurers a right to a generous price, and that &s;uch, from motives of policy, &s;hould be paid: but yet I cannot conceive that they, in direct violation of every principle of genero&s;ity, of rea&s;on, and of ju&s;|tice, &s;hould be allowed (if it is po&s;&s;ible to re&s;train them) to a|vail them&s;elves of the difficulties of the times, and to ama&s;s for|tunes upon the public ruin.</P>
<P>This grievance is now an object of univer&s;al complaint, and of univer&s;al apprehen&s;ion: and the con&s;equences that are likely to re&s;ult from a continuance of it excite in every well-affected mind the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable feelings. The inclo&s;ed copy of a memorial from a part of the Penn&s;ylvania officers &s;hews their &s;entiments upon the &s;ubject; and I am per&s;uaded tho&s;e of the whole army are &s;imilar, as they have and do experience the gro&s;s abu&s;es they complain of. I know that ways and means, for preventing this evil wholly, are difficult (if impracticable) to find out: but I &s;hould hope that Congre&s;s them&s;elves, or the &s;upreme powers in the re&s;pective &s;tates, through their recom|mendation, may devi&s;e &s;ome mode by which it may be redre&s;&s;ed in part.</P>
<P>I think there are two mea&s;ures, which, if adopted and put under proper regulations, would be of con&s;iderable &s;aving to the public, and to the army, at the &s;ame time that they would contribute a good deal to do away part of the unea&s;ine&s;s of the latter, ari&s;ing from the enormous prices they are compelled to pay for nece&s;&s;aries. The fir&s;t is the e&s;tabli&s;hment of public tan|neries in three or four of the &s;tates, under care of a judicious commi&s;&s;ary or director, to which all hides of the cattle killed for the army &s;hould be carried, and tanned. There &s;hould be
<PB N="119" REF="031423_0415_0FEC5E0BC9903630">
al&s;o deputies to attend the army to collect the hides: and it appears to me that e&s;tabli&s;hing the tanneries in different &s;tates,&mdash;for in&s;tance one in this, and another in Connecticut,&mdash;will be much more advi&s;able than fixing only one in either of them; as the bu&s;ine&s;s may be carried on more exten&s;ively, with more convenience, and at le&s;s expen&s;e, than if the raw hides were to be tran&s;ported to one place only, from which probably there would be a nece&s;&s;ity of carrying them the whole di&s;tance back again after they were dre&s;&s;ed.&mdash;This &s;ubject was under con&s;i|deration of Congre&s;s once before, and a commi&s;&s;ary (if I recol|lect, a Mr. Philips) appointed, who declined the office. Leather is of &s;uch e&s;&s;ential u&s;e, and &s;o indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary for &s;hoes and other purpo&s;es in the army, that too much care nor too effectual means cannot be taken to procure it.</P>
<P>What I have ventured to mention, if gone into, will add much to our &s;upplies, and, I am certain, will prevent the high and unju&s;tifiable prices demanded for this article when in the hands of private owners. Be&s;ides, at tho&s;e tanneries, a number of arti&s;ts, &s;uch as &s;hoe and harne&s;s makers, might be employed to work the leather up.</P>
<P>In like manner, &s;ince our imports of &s;pirit have become &s;o precarious, nay impracticable, on account of the enemy's fleet which infe&s;ts our whole coa&s;t,&mdash;I would beg leave to &s;ugge&s;t the propriety of erecting public di&s;tilleries in different &s;tates.&mdash;The benefits ari&s;ing from the moderate u&s;e of &s;trong liquor have been experienced in all armies, and are not to be di&s;puted.&mdash;In the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of affairs, our &s;oldiery cannot obtain &s;uch &s;upplies as are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; and if they are fortunate enough to get any, it is from the &s;utlers at mo&s;t extravagant rates, and at &s;uch as are incredible to tell of. This is a &s;ource of much complaint, and, I &s;hould hope, may be removed by ap|pointing proper per&s;ons to buy grain and di&s;til it for the army,&mdash;large quantities of which may be ea&s;ily procured, and on rea|&s;onable terms, in many of the &s;tates.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to the ob&s;ervation in the memorial about rations, it is certain the pre&s;ent allowed value is by no means &s;ufficient; nor does it an&s;wer the purpo&s;e intended. Since that was fix|ed, provi&s;ions, like every other article, though not from the &s;ame cau&s;es, have become extremely dear; and what at that time was a ju&s;t equivalent, is totally inadequate now. This matter, I doubt not, will have the attention of Congre&s;s, and &s;uch regulations be made re&s;pecting it, as may be right and e|quitable.</P>

It appears to me from the information I have received, that two companies&mdash;each to con&s;i&s;t of &s;ixty men at lea&s;t&mdash;under proper officers, of un&s;u&s;pected attachment, &s;pirit and activity,&mdash;&s;hould be immediately rai&s;ed, to guard the laboratory and &s;tores at Carli&s;le.

The&s;e companies, be&s;ides &s;erving as a guard, will be frequently of u&s;e as e&s;corts and con|voys to &s;tores.&mdash;If Congre&s;s &s;hould deem them nece&s;&s;ary, and order them to be enli&s;ted, yet I would recommend that they &s;hould not be rai&s;ed as merely &s;tationary or local,&mdash;having found from experience that regiments or companies formed upon &s;uch a footing enter upon other &s;ervices with great di&s;|content and reluctance, though the occa&s;ion &s;hould be never &s;o pre&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>In a letter of the thirteenth of June, I &s;ubmitted to Congre&s;s an application from the officers of cavalry re&s;pecting their hor|&s;es,&mdash;whether they were to be provided at their own or the public expen&s;e. I al&s;o laid before them, in a letter of the fifth of July, captain Sullivan's requi&s;ition for pay.&mdash;I &s;hall be glad to be honored with their determination upon the&s;e &s;ubjects, and al&s;o in general re&s;pecting the line of conduct I &s;hould pur|&s;ue as to the pay of officers taken pri&s;oners at any time before the clo&s;e of the la&s;t compaign, who have been permitted to be on parole;&mdash;and whether there is to be any di&s;tinction between &s;uch of them as are continued by new appointments, and tho&s;e who are not. I have frequent applications in the&s;e in&s;tances, and wi&s;h to know how to act.</P>
<P>Since the expre&s;s from general Schuyler left this, I received a letter from governor Clinton, a copy of which, and of its in|clo&s;ures, I herewith tran&s;mit, as they give a much more favor|able account of the affair at Fort-Schuyler, than was contained in his letter.</P>

<P>THE unfavorable &s;ituation of our affairs in the northern department, and the pre&s;&s;ing applications of general Schuyler for aid, induced me to write &s;ome time ago to general Putnam to hold Vancortlandt and Living&s;ton's regiments in readine&s;s to embark for Albany, in ca&s;e I &s;hould find it nece&s;&s;ary, and the &s;uccours he received of militia would ju&s;tify the mea&s;ure.

<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, I have, contrary to my wi&s;hes, but from the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e, ordered colonel Morgan to march imme|diately with his corps as an additional &s;upport.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FROM the time which has elap&s;ed &s;ince general Howe departed from the capes of Delaware, there is the &s;tronge&s;t rea|&s;on to conclude that he is gone either to the ea&s;tward or &s;outh|ward, and with a de&s;ign to execute &s;ome determined plan. The danger of the &s;ea,&mdash;the injury his troops mu&s;t &s;u&s;tain from be|ing &s;o long confined,&mdash;the lo&s;s of time, &s;o late in the campaign,&mdash;will &s;carcely admit a &s;uppo&s;ition that he is merely making a feint, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to return either to the Delaware or the North-river without performing &s;ome enterpri&s;e fir&s;t in another quarter. The probability is in favour of a &s;outhern expedi|tion, becau&s;e he has been &s;een, &s;ince his departure from the capes, off Sinapuxent, &s;teering a &s;outhern cour&s;e,&mdash;and becau&s;e, had his de&s;tination been to the ea&s;tward, his arrival there, from the general &s;tate of the winds, mu&s;t have announced it before this, or his fleet would have been di&s;covered by &s;ome of the crui&s;ers on that coa&s;t.</P>
<P>If he is gone to the &s;outhward, he mu&s;t be gone far that way: for, had Che&s;apeak-bay been his object, he would have been there long &s;ince, and the fact well e&s;tabli&s;hed. Beyond that, there is no place &s;hort of Charle&s;ton, of &s;ufficient importance to engage his attention. The exten&s;ive commerce, the va&s;t accu|mulation of military and other &s;tores in that town and its depen|dencies, with the eclat it would give his arms if he &s;hould un|fortunately take it, afford him &s;tronger inducements to direct his operations there, than he could po&s;&s;ibly have el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>Matters being thus circum&s;tanced, an important que&s;tion a|ri&s;es,&mdash;how this army is to be employed? If his intentions are &s;uch as I have &s;uppo&s;ed them, it appears to me that an attempt to follow him would not only be fruitle&s;s, but would be attend|ed with the mo&s;t ruinous con&s;equences. The di&s;tance is &s;o im|men&s;e that general Howe might accompli&s;h every purpo&s;e he had in view, before we could po&s;&s;ibly arrive to oppo&s;e him; and &s;o long a march through an unhealthy climate at this &s;ea&s;on would debilitate and wa&s;te a principal part of our force. Add|ed to this, after we had made a con&s;iderable progre&s;s, he might ea&s;ily reimbark his troops and turn his arms again&s;t Philadelphia or el&s;ewhere, as he &s;hould think proper, without our being in a condition to give the lea&s;t aid.</P>
<P>As the&s;e, and many other rea&s;ons which will readily occur to Congre&s;s, will &s;hew the impracticability of our counteracting general Howe in that quarter with any good effect, we have no other alternative left than to remain here idle and inactive, on
<PB N="124" REF="031423_0420_0FEC5E1D46391808">
the remote probability of his returning this way,&mdash;or to pro|ceed towards Hud&s;on's-river, with a view of oppo&s;ing general Burgoyne, or making an attempt on York-I&s;land, as the &s;itua|tion of affairs &s;hall point out. A &s;ucce&s;sful &s;troke with re&s;pect to either would be attended with the mo&s;t &s;ignal advantages, and would be the be&s;t compen&s;ation we could make for any lo&s;&s;es we may &s;u&s;tain to the &s;outhward. Be&s;ides the&s;e con&s;iderations,&mdash;if, after all our conjectures and rea&s;onings upon the &s;ubject, general Howe &s;hould be gone to the ea&s;tward to co-operate with Mr. Burgoyne, the army will be, by the movement pro|po&s;ed, &s;o far on its way to prevent, I hope, the &s;ucce&s;s of his enterpri&s;e.</P>
<P>The above rea&s;ons led me to call a council of general officers this morning, to take the &s;ubject of removing the troops from hence into con&s;ideration: and I am happy to inform Congre&s;s they were in &s;entiment with me upon the occa&s;ion, as they will perceive by a copy of the proceedings then had, which I do my|&s;elf the honor of laying before them. Neverthele&s;s, as it is a movement which may involve the mo&s;t important con&s;equences, I have thought proper to &s;ubmit it to Congre&s;s for their deli|beration and deci&s;ion. If it is deemed expedient, we have per|haps not a moment to lo&s;e in carrying it into execution; and, under this per&s;ua&s;ion, I have &s;ent colonel Hamilton, one of my aides, (who will have the honor of delivering this) to bring me the re&s;ult of their opinion.</P>
<P>As the northern department has been all along con&s;idered &s;e|parate, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure di&s;tinct, and there are &s;pecial re|&s;olves ve&s;ting the command in particular per&s;ons.&mdash;in ca&s;e it &s;hould hereafter appear eligible to unite the two armies, it may perhaps be nece&s;&s;ary that Congre&s;s &s;hould place the matter up|on &s;uch a footing as to remove all &s;cruples or difficulties about the command, that could po&s;&s;ibly ari&s;e on my arrival there.&mdash;This I reque&s;t, from a di&s;po&s;ition to harmony, and from my knowing the ill and fatal con&s;equences that have often ari&s;en from &s;uch controver&s;ies, and not from the mo&s;t di&s;tant appre|hen&s;ion that one would take place upon &s;uch an event. The thing however is po&s;&s;ible, and to guard again&s;t it can do injury.</P>

<P>P. S. That I may not appear incon&s;i&s;tent, to advi&s;e, and to act before I obtain an opinion,&mdash;I beg leave to mention that I &s;hall move the army to the Delaware to-morrow morning, to change their ground at any rate, as their pre&s;ent encampment begins to be di&s;agreeable, and would injure their health in a &s;hort time.

<P>ON my return to this place la&s;t evening from White-Clay creek, I was honored with yours of the twenty-&s;eventh, with &s;undry re&s;olves of Congre&s;s, to which I &s;hall pay due atten|tion.</P>
<P>The enemy advanced a part of their army ye&s;terday to Gray'&s;-Hill about two miles on this &s;ide of Elk,&mdash;whether with intent to take po&s;t there, or to cover while they remove what &s;tores they found in the town, I cannot yet determine.&mdash;I do not know what quantity of private property remained: but of the public there were &s;everal thou&s;and bu&s;hels of corn and oats, which might have been removed al&s;o, had not mo&s;t of the teams in the country been employed by private per&s;ons in bringing off very valuable goods.</P>
<P>Our light parties ye&s;terday took between thirty and forty pri&s;oners; twelve de&s;erters from the navy and eight from the army have already come in; but they are able to give us very little intelligence. They generally agree that their troops are healthy, but that their hor&s;es &s;uffered very much by the voyage.</P>
<P>By a letter from general Gates which you were plea&s;ed to tran&s;mit me ye&s;terday, he reque&s;ts that commi&s;&s;ions may be &s;ent to brigadiers Glover, Poor, and Patter&s;on, which I beg the favor of you to do by the return expre&s;s. The two la&s;t lo&s;t theirs with their baggage at Ticonderoga, and general Glover had none.</P>

<P>How far the enemy have it in view to extend them&s;elves in a line from bay to bay, I cannot determine: but the idea has taken place with many: and it is &s;aid to be founded on their hints to &s;ome per&s;ons, who,&mdash;from accident in &s;ome in&s;tances, and perhaps choice in others,&mdash;have had a more familiar inter|cour&s;e with them.

<P>Ye&s;terday there was &s;ome &s;kirmi&s;hing between one of our advanced parties and one of the enemy's, in which they were obliged to retreat with the lo&s;s of an officer and three men kil|led, according to report.&mdash;We had one private wounded.</P>

<P>This morning the enemy came out with a con&s;iderable force and three pieces of artillery, again&s;t our light advanced corps, and, after &s;ome pretty &s;mart &s;kirmi&s;hing, obliged them to re|treat,&mdash;being far inferior in number, and without cannon.&mdash;The lo&s;s on either &s;ide is not yet a&s;certained: ours, though not exactly known, is not very con&s;iderable: theirs, we have rea&s;on to believe, was much greater, as &s;ome of our parties, compo&s;ed of expert mark&s;men, had opportunities of giving them &s;everal clo&s;e, well-directed fires,&mdash;more particularly in one in&s;tance, when a body of riflemen formed a kind of ambu&s;cade.&mdash;They advanced about two miles this &s;ide of Iron-Hill, and then with|drew to that place, leaving a piquet at Couch's mill, about a mile in front. Our parties now lie at White-Clay creek, ex|cept the advanced piquets, which are at Chri&s;tiana bridge.</P>
<P>Our monday a large detachment of the enemy landed at Ce|cil court-hou&s;e; and this morning I had advice of their having advanced on the Newca&s;tle road as far as Car&s;on's tavern. Parties of hor&s;e were &s;ent out to reconnoitre them, which went three miles beyond the Red-Lion, but could neither &s;ee nor hear of them; whence I conjectured they filed off by a road to their left, and fell in with their main body.&mdash;The de&s;ign of their movement this morning &s;eems to have been to di&s;per&s;e our light troops who had been trouble&s;ome to them, and to gain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Iron-Hill, to e&s;tabli&s;h a po&s;t mo&s;t probably for covering their retreat in ca&s;e of accidents.</P>

<P>In re&s;pect to the militia reque&s;ted of Jer&s;ey, his excellency is doubtful whether they can be obtained: for governor Li|ving&s;ton, by a late letter, informed him that he had no expect|ation that more than three hundred, of the thou&s;and called for to garri&s;on the po&s;ts in the Highlands, would march, notwith|&s;tanding he has i&s;&s;ued orders for that purpo&s;e; and that three weeks would probably elap&s;e before that number went. If the requi&s;ition can be complied with, he has no doubt of general Dickin&s;on's exertions, and is &s;atisfied of the propriety of ap|pointing him to the command.

<P>Generals Sullivan, Stirling, and Stephen, with their divi&s;i|ons, are gone in pur&s;uit, and to attack it if they can with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s.&mdash;There has been a &s;cattering loo&s;e fire be|tween our parties on each &s;ide the creek &s;ince the action in the morning, which ju&s;t now became warm, when general Maxwell pa&s;&s;ed over with his corps, and drove them from their ground with the lo&s;s of thirty men left dead on the &s;pot (among them a captain of the forty-ninth), and a number of intrenching tools with which they were throwing up a battery.</P>

adequate to the force with which the enemy attacked us on our right; in con&s;equence of which, the troops fir&s;t engaged were obliged to retire before they could be reinforced.

<P>I HAVE been honored with your favor of this date.&mdash;I heartily wi&s;h the works on Delaware were completed: but I think,&mdash;and in this opinion my officers concur,&mdash;that the &s;er|vice will be injured if any part of the continental troops were now to be employed about them. If we &s;hould be able to op|po&s;e general Howe with &s;ucce&s;s in the field, the works will be unnece&s;&s;ary;&mdash;if not, and he &s;hould force us from hence, he will certainly po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of them. But, to prevent his at|tempting it now, I have directed the meadows on Province.

I&s;land to be overflowed immediately, and any other grounds that may be thought nece&s;&s;ary for that purpo&s;e.&mdash;The works have been more peculiarly under the direction of mon&s;ieur Du Coudray, and I doubt not he will pay every attention to their completion and &s;ecurity, that the &s;ituation of affairs will admit of.</P>
<P>A part of the militia under general Arm&s;trong will be po&s;t|ed along Schuylkill, to throw up redoubts at the different fords, which will be occa&s;ionally occupied, whil&s;t I move to the other &s;ide with the main body of the army.&mdash;This di&s;po&s;ition appears to me the mo&s;t eligible from a con&s;ideration of all circum&s;tan|ces, and better than if any part of our pre&s;ent force was to be employed at the forts.&mdash;If further reinforcements of the militia &s;hould come in, they perhaps may be more properly a&s;&s;igned to that bu&s;ine&s;s than any we now have.</P>
<P>Your letter re&s;pecting general De Borre ju&s;t now came to hand: I &s;hall tran&s;mit him a copy of it and of the re&s;olution. There can be no court of inquiry into his conduct at this time: as &s;oon as the &s;tate of the army will admit, it will be held.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR favor of ye&s;terday, with its &s;everal inclo&s;ures, came to hand la&s;t night.&mdash;Though I would willingly pay every attention to the re&s;olutions of Congre&s;s, yet, in the late in&s;tance re&s;pecting the recall of general Sullivan, I mu&s;t beg leave to defer giving any order about it, till I hear further from that honorable body.&mdash;Our &s;ituation at this time is critical and de|licate; and nothing &s;hould be done to add to its embarra&s;&s;|ments. We are now mo&s;t probably on the point of another action: and to derange the army by withdrawing &s;o many ge|neral officers from it, may and mu&s;t be attended with many di&s;|agreeable if not ruinous con&s;equences. Such a proceeding at another time might not produce any bad effects: but how can the army be po&s;&s;ibly conducted with a pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, if the general officers are taken off in the moment of battle?&mdash;Congre&s;s may rely upon it, &s;uch a mea&s;ure will not promote but injure the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>It is not my wi&s;h to prevent or to delay a proper inquiry in|to general Sullivan's conduct a &s;ingle in&s;tant, when the circum|&s;tances of the army will admit: but now they prohibit it, and (I think) the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion in his command al&s;o. The recall of general St. Clair obliged me to part with general Lincoln whom I could but ill &s;pare; &s;o that the whole charge of his di|vi&s;ion is now upon general Wayne, there being no other briga|dier in it than him&s;elf.&mdash;The Maryland troops, if general Sullivan is taken away, will not have one general officer, general Small|wood being at the head of the militia coming from that &s;tate, and general De Borre &s;u&s;pended:&mdash;added to this, colonel Gi&s;t, who commands one regiment of them, is now from it by order.&mdash;In a word, &s;ir, whether the charges alledged again&s;t Sullivan are true or fal&s;e, or whether his conduct has been exceptionable or not, I am &s;atisfied the re&s;olution for his recall at this time was unhappily adopted, and, if carried into execution, will not fail to add new difficulties to our pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;es: and I am obliged to ob&s;erve, in ju&s;tice to my own character, that I can|not be an&s;werable for the con&s;equences which may ari&s;e from a want of officers to a&s;&s;i&s;t me.</P>
<P>It gives me great plea&s;ure to find general Gates is on &s;o re|&s;pectable a footing; and I hope our affairs in that quarter, in the cour&s;e of a little time, will be in as pro&s;perous a train as we could rea&s;onably wi&s;h.</P>
<P>The main body of the enemy, from the be&s;t intelligence I have been able to get, lies near Dilworthtown, not far from the
<PB N="140" REF="031423_0436_0FEC5E486773B758">
field of action, where they have been bu&s;ily employed in bury|ing their dead, which, from accounts, amounted to a very con&s;i|derable number.&mdash;We are moving up this road to get between the enemy and the Swedes' ford, and to prevent them from turning our right flank, which they &s;eem to have a violent in|clination to effect, by all their movements.</P>
<P>I would beg leave to recommend in the mo&s;t earne&s;t manner, that &s;ome board or committee be appointed, or &s;ome mode adopted, for obtaining &s;upplies of blankets for the troops:&mdash;many are now without; and the &s;ea&s;on becoming cold, they will be injured in their health, and unfitted for &s;ervice, unle&s;s they are immediately provided with them. Our &s;upplies in this in&s;tance, as well as in every article of clothing, cannot be too great, as there are frequent lo&s;&s;es not equally to be avoid|ed.&mdash;I would al&s;o ob&s;erve that I think, in point of prudence and &s;ound policy, every &s;pecies of provi&s;ions &s;hould be removed from the city, except &s;uch as will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upply the pre&s;ent demands of this army. I have been told there are con&s;iderable quantities in private hands, which &s;hould not be &s;uffered to remain a moment longer than they can be conveyed away.</P>

<P>I HAVE been honored with your two favors of ye&s;|terday, and their inclo&s;ures, to which due attention &s;hall be paid.</P>
<P>The enemy &s;eem now to be &s;training every nerve to accom|pli&s;h their purpo&s;e: but I tru&s;t, whatever pre&s;ent &s;ucce&s;s they may have, they will, ere long, experience a rever&s;e of fortune.&mdash;If they have four thou&s;and men in the Jer&s;eys, it is probable they have &s;omething more &s;erious in view than a mere diver|&s;ion: but I am in hopes, when general M'Dougal comes to u|nite his force with the militia, general Dickin&s;on will be &s;trong enough effectually to make head again&s;t them.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday the enemy moved from Concord, by the Edgemont towards the Lanca&s;ter road, with evident de&s;ign to gain our right flank. This obliged us to alter our po&s;ition and march to this place, from whence we intend immediately to proceed to War|wick.&mdash;We &s;uffered much from the &s;evere weather ye&s;terday and la&s;t night, being unavoidably &s;eparated from our tents and baggage,&mdash;which not only endangers the health of the men, but has been very injurious to our arms and ammuni|tion. The&s;e, when we arrive at Warwick, we &s;hall endeavor, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, to put again into a proper condition,&mdash;to do which, and to refre&s;h the men, are two principal motives for going there.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE not had the honor of addre&s;&s;ing you &s;ince your adjournment to Lanca&s;ter, and I &s;incerely wi&s;h that my fir&s;t let|ter was upon a more agreeable &s;ubject.&mdash;The enemy, by a va|riety of perplexing manoeuvres through a country from which I could not derive the lea&s;t intelligence (being to a man di&s;af|fected), contrived to pa&s;s the Schuylkill la&s;t night at the Flat|land and other fords in the neighborhood of it. They marched immediately towards Philadelphia, and I imagine their advan|ced parties will be near that city to-night.</P>
<P>They had &s;o far got the &s;tart before I received certain intel|ligence
<PB N="142" REF="031423_0438_0FEC5E53EDC94C58">
that any con&s;iderable number had cro&s;&s;ed, that I found it in vain to think of overtaking their rear, with troops harra&s;&s;|ed as ours had been with con&s;tant marching &s;ince the battle of Brandiwine; and therefore concluded, by the advice of all the general officers, to march from this place to-morrow morn|ing towards Philadelphia, and on the way endeavor to form a junction with the continental troops under general M'Dougal from Peek&s;kill, and the Jer&s;ey militia under general Dickin&s;on, both of whom are, I hope, on this &s;ide the Delaware.&mdash;I am al|&s;o obliged to wait for general Wayne and general Smallwood, who were left upon the other &s;ide of Schuylkill, in hopes of falling upon the enemy's rear:&mdash;but they have eluded them as well as us.</P>
<P>When I la&s;t recro&s;&s;ed the Schuylkill, it was with a firm in|tent of giving the enemy battle wherever I &s;hould meet them, and accordingly advanced as far as the Warren tavern upon the Lanca&s;ter road, near which place the two armies were upon the point of coming to a general engagement, but were prevented by a mo&s;t violent flood of rain, which continued all the day and following night. When it held up, we had the mortification to find that our ammunition, which had been com|pleted to forty rounds a man, was entirely ruined; and in that &s;ituation we had nothing left for it but to find out a &s;trong piece of ground which we could ea&s;ily maintain till we could get the arms put into order, and a recruit of ammuni|tion.</P>
<P>Before this could be fully effected, the enemy marched from their po&s;ition near the White-hor&s;e tavern, down the road leading to the Swedes' Ford.&mdash;I immediately cro&s;&s;ed the Schuylkill above them, and threw my&s;elf full in their front, hoping to meet them in their pa&s;&s;age, or &s;oon after they had pa&s;&s;ed the river.&mdash;The day before ye&s;terday they were again in motion, and marched rapidly up the road leading towards Reading.&mdash;This induced me to believe that they had two ob|jects in view,&mdash;one to get round the right of the army,&mdash;the other perhaps to detach parties to Reading where we had con|&s;iderable quantities of military &s;tores.</P>
<P>To fru&s;trate tho&s;e intentions, I moved the army up on this &s;ide the river to this place, determined to keep pace with them: but early this morning I received intelligence that they had cro&s;&s;ed the fords below.&mdash;Why I did not follow immediately, I have mentioned in the former part of my letter: but the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;on again&s;t being able to make a forced march is the want of &s;hoes. Me&s;&s;ieurs Caroll, Cha&s;e, and Penn, who
<PB N="148" REF="031423_0439_0FEC5E55E777BAB0">
were &s;ome days with the army, can inform Congre&s;s in how deplorable a &s;ituation the troops are, for want of that nece&s;&s;ary article. At lea&s;t one thou&s;and men are bare-footed, and have performed the marches in that condition. I was told of a great number of &s;hoes in the hands of private people in Philadelphia, and &s;ent down to &s;ecure them: but I doubt the approach of the enemy will prevent it.</P>
<P>I have planned a method of throwing a garri&s;on into Fort Mifflin.&mdash;If it &s;ucceeds, and they, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;hips and gallies, &s;hould keep the ob&s;tructions in the river, ge|neral Howe's &s;ituation in Philadelphia will not be the mo&s;t a|greeable: for if his &s;upplies can be &s;topped by water, it may be ea&s;ily done by land. To do both &s;hall be my utmo&s;t en|deavor; and I am not yet without hope that the acqui&s;ition of Philadelphia may, in&s;tead of his good fortune, prove his ruin.</P>
<P>General St. Clair, who has been con&s;tantly with the army for &s;ome time pa&s;t, can give you many pieces of information which may have e&s;caped me, and therefore I refer you to him for many particulars.</P>
<P>If there are any &s;hoes and blankets to be had in Lanca&s;ter or that part of the country, I earne&s;tly intreat you to have them taken up for the u&s;e of the army. I have been informed that there are large parcels of &s;hoes in particular there.</P>
<P>Finding that the inclo&s;ed came from colonel Gib&s;on, I took the liberty of opening it, as I wanted much to know what route he was taking.</P>
<P>I have ordered all the Virginia militia who are tolerably armed to come forward and join the army. Tho&s;e who have no arms are to wait at Frederictown in Maryland till they hear whether any can be provided for them at Lanca&s;ter: you will therefore be plea&s;ed to make enquiry what number can be pro|cured there, and &s;end an expre&s;s to Frederic with orders for as many men to come forward as there are arms.</P>

<P>HAVING received intelligence through two intercepted letters, that general Howe had detached a part of his force for the purpo&s;e of reducing Billing&s;port and the forts on the Dela|ware, I communicated the accounts to my general officers, who were unanimou&s;ly of opinion that a favorable opportunity offer|ed to make an attack upon the troops which were at and near Germantown. It was accordingly agreed that it &s;hould take place ye&s;terday morning, and the following di&s;po&s;itions were made.</P>
<P>The divi&s;ions of Sullivan and Wayne, flanked by Conway's brigade, were to enter the town by the way of Che&s;nut-hill, while general Arm&s;trong with the Penn&s;ylvania militia &s;hould fall down the Manatawny road by Vandeering's mill, and get upon the enemy's left and rear.&mdash;The divi&s;ions of Greene and
<PB N="145" REF="031423_0441_0FEC5E5928765660">
Stephen, flanked by M'Dougal's brigade, were to enter, by taking a circuit by way of the lime-kiln road, at the market-hou&s;e, and to attack their right wing; and the militia of Mary|land and Jer&s;ey, under generals Smallwood and Forman, were to march by the old York road, and fall upon the rear of their right. Lord Stirling, with Na&s;h and Maxwell's brigades, was to form a corps-de-re&s;erve.</P>
<P>We marched about &s;even o'clock the preceding evening, and general Sullivan's advanced party, drawn from Conway's bri|gade, attacked their piquet at Mount Airy or Mr. Allen's hou&s;e, about &s;un-ri&s;e the next morning, which pre&s;ently gave way; and his main body, con&s;i&s;ting of the right wing, following &s;oon, en|gaged the light infantry and other troops encamped near the piquet, which they forced from their ground.&mdash;Leaving their baggage, they retreated a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, having previ|ou&s;ly thrown a party into Mr. Chew's hou&s;e, who were in a &s;i|tuation not to be ea&s;ily forced, and had it in their power, from the windows, to give us no &s;mall annoyance, and in a great mea|&s;ure to ob&s;truct our advance.</P>
<P>The attack from our left column under general Greene be|gan about three-quarters of an hour after that from the right, and was for &s;ome time equally &s;ucce&s;sful. But I cannot enter upon the particulars of what happened in that quarter, as I am not yet informed of them with &s;ufficient certainty and preci&s;ion.</P>
<P>The morning was extremely foggy, which prevented our im|proving the advantages we gained, &s;o well as we &s;hould other|wi&s;e have done. This circum&s;tance, by concealing from us the true &s;ituation of the enemy, obliged us to act with more caution and le&s;s expedition than we could have wi&s;hed, and gave the e|nemy time to recover from the effects of our fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion and, what was &s;till more unfortunate, it &s;erved to keep our dif|ferent parties in ignorance of each other's movements, and hin|dered their acting in concert. It al&s;o occa&s;ioned them to mi&s;|take one another for the enemy,&mdash;which, I believe, more than any thing el&s;e, contributed to the misfortune which en&s;ued.&mdash;In the mid&s;t of the mo&s;t promi&s;ing appearances, when every thing gave the mo&s;t flattering hopes of victory, the troops began &s;ud|denly to retreat, and entirely left the field, in &s;pite of every ef|fort that could be made to rally them.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, it may be &s;aid the day was rather unfortu|nate than injurious.&mdash;We &s;u&s;tained no material lo&s;s of men, and brought off all the artillery, except one piece which was di&s;|mounted.&mdash;The enemy are nothing the better by the event; and our troops, who are not in the lea&s;t di&s;pirited by it, have
<PB N="146" REF="031423_0442_0FEC5D73A21762F0">
gained what all young troops gain by being in actions. We have had however &s;everal valuable officers killed and wounded, particularly the latter. General Na&s;h is among the wounded, and his life is de&s;paired of.&mdash;As &s;oon as it is po&s;&s;ible to obtain a return of our lo&s;s, I will tran&s;mit it.</P>
<P>In ju&s;tice to general Sullivan and the whole right wing of the army, who&s;e conduct I had an opportunity of ob&s;erving, as they acted immediately under my eye:&mdash;I have the plea&s;ure to inform you that both officers and men behaved with a degree of gallantry that did them the highe&s;t honor.</P>

<P>SINCE I had the honor of addre&s;&s;ing you on the fifth, I have obtained a return of our lo&s;s in the action on &s;aturday, by which it appears to be much more con&s;iderable than I at fir&s;t apprehended, though I always imagined my&s;elf that it was greater than it was generally &s;uppo&s;ed to be. The copy of the return inclo&s;ed will &s;hew the amount as it now &s;tands; but I hope many of tho&s;e who are mi&s;&s;ing will yet come in: I fear however there are &s;everal under that denomination to be added to the number of the &s;lain, as the action was warm in e|very quarter, from the information of the officers who command|ed the different attacks.</P>
<P>What lo&s;s the enemy &s;u&s;tained, I am not able preci&s;ely to a&s;|certain: but from a variety of corre&s;ponding accounts of per|&s;ons who left the city &s;ince, and tho&s;e of a de&s;erter, it was very con&s;iderable. The de&s;erter, who is intelligent, &s;ays general Agnew was killed, &s;ir William Er&s;kine wounded in the head and leg, and that their general l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s, in killed and wounded a|mounted to near eight hundred. Several reputable per&s;ons from the city corroborate this, particularly with re&s;pect to ge|neral Agnew's death: &s;ome &s;ay upwards of two hundred wag|gons with wounded were carried in after the action, and before they came out, and that it was the common belief there, the enemy had been &s;everely handled.</P>
<P>It is with much chagrin and mortification I add, that every
<PB N="147" REF="031423_0443_0FEC5E612E83BED0">
account confirms the opinion I at fir&s;t entertained, that our troops retreated at the in&s;tant when victory was declaring her|&s;elf in our favor.&mdash;The tumult, di&s;order, and even de&s;pair, which, it &s;eems, had taken place in the Briti&s;h army, were &s;carcely to be paralleled: and it is &s;aid, &s;o &s;trongly did the ideas of a retreat prevail, that Che&s;ter was fixed on as their rendez|vous. I can di&s;cover no other cau&s;e for not improving this happy opportunity, than the extreme hazine&s;s of the weather.</P>
<P>My intention is to encamp the army at &s;ome &s;uitable place to re&s;t and refre&s;h the men, and recover them from the &s;till re|maining effects of that di&s;order naturally attendant on a retreat. We &s;hall here wait for the reinforcements coming on, and &s;hall then act according to circum&s;tances.&mdash;General Varnum, with the detachment from Peek&s;kill amounting to about twelve hun|dred, including officers, would be la&s;t night at Coryel's ferry. About five hundred militia from Virginia, and two hundred from Maryland, together with colonel Gib&s;on's &s;tate regiment con|&s;i&s;ting of two hundred and twenty-&s;ix effectives, have already joined the army.&mdash;Since the action, general Forman's brigade of Jer&s;ey militia has quitted us. The men began to be unea&s;y at their &s;ituation, and de&s;irous to return home: and as, by &s;ome intelligence received from general Dickin&s;on, there was rea&s;on to imagine there might be a call for their &s;ervices in the Jer|&s;eys, it was thought expedient to gratify their de&s;ire.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of our water defence on the Delaware is far from being as flattering as could be wi&s;hed. After &s;ome &s;light oppo|&s;ition from the Jer&s;ey militia under general Newcomb, a de|tachment of the enemy took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Billing&s;port. This perhaps is an event of no material con&s;equence: but it is to be lamented that many of the officers and &s;eamen on board the gal|lies have manife&s;ted a di&s;po&s;ition that does them little honor. Looking upon their &s;ituation as de&s;perate, or probably from wor&s;e motives, they have been guilty of the mo&s;t alarming de|&s;ertions: two whole crews, including the officers, have de&s;erted to the enemy. I learn however by captain Brewer, who is this moment arrived here from the fleet, that the accounts they have received from the city, of our late attack, were &s;uch as to have produced a favorable change, and to have in&s;pired them with more confidence.&mdash;I would here ob&s;erve, that the charge of bad conduct was by no means applicable to the whole:&mdash;far from it.&mdash;He further adds that four of the enemy's &s;hips made an attempt ye&s;terday morning to weigh the chevaux-de-fri&s;e op|po&s;ite to Billing&s;port, but were repul&s;ed by our gallies,&mdash;which has al&s;o contributed to rai&s;e the &s;pirits of the &s;eamen. Our
<PB N="148" REF="031423_0444_0FEC5E65C259F590">
garri&s;on on Fort-I&s;land, con&s;i&s;ting of little more than two hun|dred continental troops under lieutenant-colonel Smith, appear determined to maintain their po&s;ts to the la&s;t extremity.</P>
<P>I beg leave to mention to Congre&s;s that there is a great defi|ciency of general officers to command this army. When the detachment coming from Peek&s;kill joins us, we &s;hall have thir|teen brigades. The&s;e require as many brigadiers, and &s;ix major-generals.&mdash;in&s;tead of the&s;e, we &s;hall have only four major-gene|rals and &s;ix brigadiers; and the deficiency will be &s;till increa&s;|ed by the death of general Na&s;h, which, from every appearance, is momently to be expected. General Woodford's ab&s;ence, oc|ca&s;ioned by his wound, adds to our embarra&s;&s;ments, though it will be but for a time. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, Congre&s;s will be &s;en&s;ible that the government of the army cannot go on with that energy which is e&s;&s;ential to its well-being and &s;ucce&s;s. Neither officers nor men will transfer the re&s;pect and obedience they pay to a general officer, to a colonel who happens to be appointed to the temporary command of a brigade; nor will he, knowing his authority to be only temporary, be as &s;olicit|ous to inforce it as one who is con&s;cious he is to continue in the &s;tation he fills. Want of lei&s;ure prevents my being more parti|cular at this time: but I &s;hall take the liberty, in a day or two, to point out the troops that are in want of general officers, with my ob&s;ervations on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I cannot however omit this opportunity of recommending ge|neral M'Dougal to their notice. This gentleman, from the time of his appointment as brigadier,&mdash;from his abilities, mili|tary knowledge, and approved bravery,&mdash;has every claim to promotion. If I mi&s;take not, he was pa&s;&s;ed over in the la&s;t ap|pointment of major-generals, and younger officers preferred be|fore him: but his di&s;intere&s;ted attachment to the &s;ervice pre|vented his acting in the manner that is cu&s;tomary in like cir|cum&s;tances. This, I think, gives him a peculiar title to e&s;teem, and concurs with the opinion I have of his value as an officer, to make me wi&s;h it may appear advi&s;able to Congre&s;s to pro|mote him to one of the vacancies.</P>
<P>It would be well if the intended inquiry into the conduct of general St. Clair could be brought to a &s;peedy i&s;&s;ue; and, if he is acquitted to the &s;atisfaction of Congre&s;s, that, as his general character as an officer is good, he may be again re&s;tored to the &s;ervice.</P>

<P>AS general Howe's operations are in this quarter, and his object in all probability fixed for this campaign, I am induc|ed to &s;ubmit it to the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s if the whole or a part of the regiment of artillery commanded by colonel Har|ri&s;on &s;hould not be immediately ordered to join this army.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON wedne&s;day evening I received the honor of your letter of the &s;eventh with it &s;everal inclo&s;ures.&mdash;The providing of &s;uitable quarters for the troops during the winter demands our attention: but I confe&s;s it is difficult to &s;ay where they will be. Sundry circum&s;tances may occur in the cour&s;e of the campaign, to render any provi&s;ion, which might now be thought of, alto|gether improper.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to general Putnam's letter, though the accounts tran&s;mitted by colonel Hawkes Hay indicate that the enemy
<PB N="150" REF="031423_0446_0FEC5E68380A1990">
had &s;ome attack in contemplation, yet I cannot but think the force the general mentions to have been at New-York was greatly exaggerated. The highe&s;t number of the reinforce|ments, &s;aid to have arrived, is three thou&s;and; and the&s;e are mentioned to be half boys. Other reports make it much le&s;s,&mdash;and &s;ome as low as five or &s;ix hundred.&mdash;However, be it what it may, it is not in my power to grant him aid.&mdash;Had the rein|forcement arrived before the troops marched from Peek&s;kill, &s;o many might not have been ordered from thence. But the ca&s;e was otherwi&s;e, or at lea&s;t I was not appri&s;ed of their arri|val; and the detachments from thence were directed by the advice of my general officers, who had under con&s;ideration the &s;tate of the whole force at that po&s;t and its dependencies, ac|cording to a general return. At the &s;ame time I urged general Putnam to call in all his out-po&s;ts, and to write in pre&s;&s;ing terms to governor Trumbull to a&s;&s;i&s;t him with &s;ome militia.</P>
<P>I have not heard a &s;ingle &s;yllable more of the troops or fleet mentioned by colonel Hawkes Hay, except a vague report to|day that a number, &s;uppo&s;ed to be about fifteen hundred, had landed on this &s;ide the river at Haver&s;traw.&mdash;If the fact is &s;o, it is probable they mean to pa&s;s through the Clove and inve&s;t the forts.&mdash;I have great confidence in the activity and bravery of governor Clinton; and I tru&s;t, if &s;uch is their view, they will meet at lea&s;t with a &s;pirited if not a &s;ucce&s;sful oppo&s;ition.&mdash;I have &s;ent up lieutenant-colonel Radire, one of the engi|neers, with orders to direct &s;uch other works as may appear nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>There was a very &s;evere cannonade on wedne&s;day night: i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> began about twelve o'clock, and continued till ye&s;terday morning between &s;even and eight. I have not learned the occa&s;ion; but, from the direction, &s;uppo&s;e it was at Fort-Mifflin, or an engagement between our armed ve&s;&s;els and the enemy's &s;hips, which probably were making a &s;econd attempt again&s;t the che|vaux-de-fri&s;e.&mdash;I have determined to maintain the po&s;t at Red-bank, if it can be done, and have detached colonel Greene there with his regiment of Rhode-I&s;land troops, con&s;i&s;ting of about two hundred and twelve effective privates. I have al&s;o written to general Newcomb of Jer&s;ey, pre&s;&s;ing him to give all the aid he can from the militia.</P>
<P>Since my letter of the &s;eventh we have been joined by more of the Virginia militia.&mdash;The whole number now in camp a|mounts to about eleven hundred. Many of their arms are in|different, and almo&s;t the whole are de&s;titute of pouches and other nece&s;&s;ary accoutrements.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="031423_0447_0FEC5E7257100998">
On &s;unday the enemy evacuated Billing&s;port.&mdash;They left all our cannon, but burned the platforms and carriages.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed you will receive a letter addre&s;&s;ed to me by colonel Portail. Congre&s;s will judge of the contents, and decide upon them as they may think they merit.</P>
<P>The military che&s;t is nearly exhau&s;ted, not having more than ten thou&s;and dollars in it; and a large part of the army is to pay for the month of Augu&s;t. Be&s;ides their claims, large &s;ums are wanted by the quarter-ma&s;ter general, and for other pur|po&s;es.&mdash;Congre&s;s, I hope, will order &s;uch immediate &s;upply to be forwarded to the payma&s;ter-general, as &s;hall be in their power.</P>
<P><HI>October</HI> 11.&mdash;I wi&s;h to know what &s;tores of lead we have, and what expectations of further &s;upplies. I am rather unea&s;y on this head, as I have not been able to obtain &s;atisfaction on &s;ome inquiries within the cour&s;e of a few days.</P>
<P>The cannonade mentioned above was between our gallies and a detachment of the enemy who were attempting to throw up a battery at Webb's or the lowe&s;t ferry on Schuylkill. It has been repeated this morning.&mdash;Their de&s;ign, in erecting this battery, probably is to cover their pa&s;&s;age to Province-I&s;land, from whence, by occupying the grounds about the pe&s;t-hou&s;es, they may expect to annoy Fort-Mifflin.</P>
<P>Our di&s;tre&s;s for want of &s;hoes and &s;tockings is amazingly great, particularly for want of the former. On this account we have a great many men who cannot do duty, and &s;everal detained at the ho&s;pitals for no other cau&s;e.&mdash;I mu&s;t reque&s;t Congre&s;s to continue their exertions to relieve us, and to direct every &s;upply of the&s;e and other nece&s;&s;aries to be forwarded as &s;oon as they po&s;&s;ibly can after they are collected. It will be proper to &s;end them on as fa&s;t as they can be procured, without waiting to make up a con&s;iderable quantity to be brought at one time.</P>
<P>I was this morning honored with your favors of the ninth, and their &s;everal inclo&s;ures.&mdash;I feel in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible manner the honorable approbation Congre&s;s have been plea&s;ed to give of my conduct, and that of the army under my command, in the action on the fourth in&s;tant: nor am I le&s;s indebted to you, &s;ir, for the polite mode in which you have conveyed their &s;en|timents.&mdash;I &s;hall communicate the re&s;olve upon the &s;ubject to the army, and hope, if a favorable opportunity offers, under the &s;miles of providence, they will merit, by more &s;ub&s;tantial &s;er|vices, the further applau&s;e of their country.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I had the honor of addre&s;&s;ing you on the eleventh in&s;tant, nothing material has happened between our army and general Howe's.&mdash;The inclo&s;ed copies of commodore. Hazle|wood and colonel Bradford's letters will &s;hew the &s;ituation of affairs in the navy and at Fort-Mifflin, on the eleventh,&mdash;which are the late&s;t accounts I have received from thence. But there has been a warm cannonade ever &s;ince, which continued, with but little intermi&s;&s;ion, till between two and three o'clock ye&s;|terday afternoon, when it cea&s;ed. The re&s;ult I have not heard; but I hope, from the determined &s;pirit of the fleet and the gar|ri&s;on, matters continue as we could wi&s;h.</P>
<P>I received an expre&s;s la&s;t night from general Putnam, in|forming me of the capture of Fort-Montgomery, and the con|&s;equent evacuation of Peek&s;kill. I &s;hould &s;end copies of his letters to me: but as the expre&s;s who brought them had di&s;|patches for Congre&s;s, I conclude he has advi&s;ed them fully on the &s;ubject.&mdash;The&s;e events may have an unhappy influence on our northern affairs: but as the Connecticut militia &s;eem to be coming in fa&s;t, and governor Clinton is exerting him&s;elf to bring out the force of New-York,&mdash;if general Putnam can but keep pace with their fleet in their progre&s;s up the river, I hope he will be able to fru&s;trate their de&s;ign of relieving general Burgoyne, and that every thing will &s;till terminate well in that quarter.</P>
<P>It gives me pain to repeat &s;o often the wants of the army: and nothing would induce me to it but the mo&s;t urgent nece&s;&s;i|ty. Every mode hitherto adopted for &s;upplying them has pro|ved inadequate, notwith&s;tanding my be&s;t endeavors to make the mo&s;t of the means which have been in my power.&mdash;The inclo|&s;ed return will &s;hew how great our deficiency in the mo&s;t e&s;|&s;ential
<PB N="153" REF="031423_0449_0FEC5E76032AC2B0">
articles.&mdash;What new expedient Congre&s;s can devi&s;e for more effectually an&s;wering the&s;e demands, I know not, per&s;uad|ed as I am that their clo&s;e&s;t attention has not been wanting to a matter of &s;o great importance: but, circum&s;tanced as we are, I am under an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of troubling them, that if any new &s;ource can be opened for alleviating our di&s;tre&s;&s;es, it may be embraced as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible; for it is impo&s;&s;ible that any army, &s;o unprovided, can long &s;ub&s;i&s;t, or act with that vigor which is requi&s;ite to en&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The return now inclo&s;ed is for troops pre&s;ent in camp,&mdash;be|&s;ides which, there are numbers in the &s;everal ho&s;pitals, totally de&s;titute of the nece&s;&s;aries they require to &s;it them for the field; and, on this account alone, are prevented from joining their corps. The recruits coming in are al&s;o in the &s;ame me|lancholy predicament.&mdash;I cannot a&s;certain with preci&s;ion what quantity of clothing is at this time in Mr. Mea&s;e's hands: but, from every account, what he has can admini&s;ter but a very par|tial relief.&mdash;I know he is entirely bare of &s;ome of the mo&s;t ca|pital articles we want.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to cartouch-boxes, without which it is impo&s;&s;i|ble to act, I cannot find from my inquiries that there are any in &s;tore. Several of the continental troops are deficient in this in&s;tance; and, what adds to our di&s;tre&s;s, there are but very few of the &s;outhern militia that are provided.&mdash;I am trying to make a collection about the country: but, from the information I have received, the mea&s;ure will be attended with but litle &s;uc|ce&s;s.&mdash;This want, though not remedied immediately, may be removed in time; and I would take the liberty to recommend that the earlie&s;t attention &s;hould be had to making a large &s;up|ply. I would al&s;o advi&s;e that much care &s;hould be u&s;e in chu&s;|ing the leather:&mdash;none but the be&s;t and thicke&s;t is proper for the purpo&s;e; and each box &s;hould have a &s;mall inner flap for the greater &s;ecurity of the cartridges again&s;t the rain and moi&s;t weather. The flaps in general are too &s;mall, and do not pro|ject &s;ufficiently over the ends or &s;ides of the boxes.&mdash;I am con|vinced of the utility, nay nece&s;&s;ity, of the&s;e improvements, and that the adoption of them, though they will incur an additional expen&s;e at fir&s;t, will prove a con&s;iderable &s;aving, and of the mo&s;t beneficial con&s;equences: for we know from unhappy ex|perience in the &s;evere rain on the &s;ixteenth ultimo, the few boxes we had of this con&s;truction pre&s;erved the ammunition without injury, whil&s;t it was almo&s;t wholly de&s;troyed in tho&s;e of the common form with a &s;ingle flap.</P>
<P>There is one thing more which I cannot omit mentioning to
<PB N="154" REF="031423_0450_0FEC5E780013B2F8">
Congre&s;s, and which, in my opinion, has a claim to their mo&s;t &s;erious attention,&mdash;I mean the general defective &s;tate of the regiments which compo&s;e our armies.&mdash;Congre&s;s will find, from a view of the returns tran&s;mitted from time to time, that they do not amount to half of their ju&s;t complement. What can be done to remedy this, I know not: but it is certain every idea of voluntary enli&s;tments &s;eems to be at an end; and it is equal|ly certain that the mode of draughting has been carried on with &s;uch want of energy in &s;ome &s;tates, and &s;o much di&s;regard|ed in others, that but a &s;mall acce&s;&s;ion of force has been deriv|ed from it. The&s;e facts are &s;ufficiently intere&s;ting of them|&s;elves.&mdash;But there are others to be added.&mdash;I am told that Virginia, in her regulations for draughting, extended her plan only to the nine regiments that were fir&s;t rai&s;ed. In what po|licy this was founded, I cannot determine: but the other &s;ix are to receive no reinforcements from that &s;ource.&mdash;Nor do matters &s;top here. The engagements of the fir&s;t nine regi|ments, I am informed, were temporary; and, according to the officers' accounts, the longe&s;t period to which any of the men are bound to &s;erve is next April:&mdash;many are not obliged &s;o long; and there are &s;ome who claim a di&s;charge at this time.&mdash;I do not mention the&s;e things through choice, but from a prin|ciple of duty, to the end that Congre&s;s may devi&s;e &s;ome timely and effectual provi&s;ion for the whole, if &s;uch &s;hall be in their power.&mdash;It is unnece&s;&s;ary to enlarge upon the &s;ubject; and I will only ob&s;erve that the con&s;equences of calling the militia [<HI>into the field in</HI>] the cour&s;e of the war have been &s;o &s;everely and ruinou&s;ly felt, that I tru&s;t our views will never be turned to them but in ca&s;es of the greate&s;t extremity.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of the re&s;olution of Congre&s;s, a court of in|quiry has &s;at upon general Sullivan. They met on the tenth, and continued the examination till the twelfth, when they came to the inclo&s;ed opinion.&mdash;The depo&s;itions and papers which were before the court were many and prolix. They are not tran&s;mitted: but they may be obtained from the court, if want|ed.&mdash;Be&s;ides the depo&s;itory proofs which they had of wounded and dead officers, they had many gentlemen before them in per&s;on.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been duly honored with your favors of the twelfth and thirteenth in&s;tant, with their &s;everal inclo&s;ures.&mdash;In re&s;pect to the re&s;olution directing a flag to be &s;ent to gene|ral Howe, I am inclined to think that the information upon which it was framed was without foundation. The letters which have come from our officers who have been lately taken gene|rally mention that their treatment has been tolerably good; and &s;uch privates as have e&s;caped have &s;aid nothing in the cour&s;e of their examination of their having been compelled to work.&mdash;For the&s;e rea&s;ons I have taken the liberty to decline &s;ending the flag. At the &s;ame time Congre&s;s may be a&s;&s;ured, if our pri&s;oners &s;uffer any wrongs, I &s;hall take every means in my power to have them redre&s;&s;ed as &s;oon as I am appri&s;ed of them.</P>
<P>It is with the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction I congratulate Congre&s;s on the &s;ucce&s;s of our arms at the northward in the action of the &s;eventh,&mdash;an event of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting importance at this critical juncture. From the happy train in which things then were, I hope we &s;hall &s;oon hear of the mo&s;t deci&s;ive advan|tages.</P>
<P>We moved this morning from the encampment at which we had been for &s;ix or &s;even days pa&s;t, and are ju&s;t arrived at the grounds we occupied before the action of the fourth. One mo|tive for coming here is to divert the enemy's attention and force from the forts. The&s;e they &s;eem to con&s;ider as capital objects, and (from their operations) mean to reduce, if po&s;&s;ible.&mdash;At pre&s;ent their de&s;igns are directed again&s;t Fort-Mifflin and the chevaux-de-fri&s;e.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I LAST night had the honor to receive your letter of the &s;eventeenth in&s;tant, with its &s;everal inclo&s;ures.</P>
<P>I heartily wi&s;h the &s;tates may feel the importance of filling their battalions, and may, in con&s;equence of the recommenda|tion of Congre&s;s, adopt &s;uch mea&s;ures as will prove effectual for the purpo&s;e. I cannot but think that heretofore there has been a want of attention in this in&s;tance, and that the &s;ubject, though intere&s;ting to the la&s;t degree, has been viewed with too much indifference. The re&s;olutions re&s;pecting de&s;ert|ers, I hope, will al&s;o have their notice. It is highly nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould come into &s;ome regulations for apprehending them, and puni&s;hing tho&s;e who give them countenance. If this is not done, our force will be always dimini&s;hing, and no exer|tions in the army will prevent it. I &s;hall try the effects of a proclamation on tho&s;e who are now delinquents, and &s;hall be happy if it meets with &s;ucce&s;s; but confe&s;s, from the experi|ment I have made, that I am not &s;anguine in my expectations that it will be the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>As to the recruiting officers, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that, notwith|&s;tanding the re&s;olution of Congre&s;s of the thirty-fir&s;t of July, and my circular letter on the &s;ubject of it to many of the &s;tates, I have not received an account that any officers have been ap|pointed, except in Connecticut and Jer&s;ey.</P>
<P>On &s;unday the enemy evacuated Germantown, and withdrew them&s;elves within their lines near the city. They &s;eem deter|mined to reduce the forts, if po&s;&s;ible; and, for this purpo&s;e, have thrown &s;everal parties over on Province-I&s;land. I was informed this afternoon that a detachment al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed the Dela|ware at Cooper's ferry in the morning. If the account be true (and I have no doubt of it) it is highly probable they mean to make an attack upon the garri&s;on at Red-bank. I am taking
<PB N="157" REF="031423_0453_0FEC5E86C0FB7AE8">
every mea&s;ure in my power to counteract them, and have writ|ten to generals Forman and Newcomb of Jer&s;ey to afford every aid they can to relieve the fort, in ca&s;e they do inve&s;t it.</P>
<P>Again&s;t Fort-Mifflin they have kept up a cannonade, more or le&s;s every day, and have thrown &s;everal &s;hells, but without do|ing any con&s;iderable damage. The explo&s;ion of one killed a private, and wounded three others, who were in a barrack where it fell. They al&s;o &s;et fire to two ammunition-boxes with a hot ball on the nineteenth, which did &s;ome injury to the barracks. I do not recollect that we have &s;uffered lately in any in&s;tances be&s;ides the&s;e.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DO my&s;elf the honor of tran&s;mitting to Congre&s;s the inclo&s;ed copies of &s;undry letters ju&s;t now received, and congra|tulate them mo&s;t &s;incerely on the important intelligence which they contain.&mdash;The damage the enemy have &s;u&s;tained in their &s;hips, I hope, will prevent their future attempts to gain the pa&s;|&s;age of the river; and the repul&s;e of the troops under count Donnop, and his captivity, I flatter my&s;elf, will al&s;o be attend|ed with the mo&s;t happy con&s;equences. At the time the&s;e ac|tions happened, a &s;upply of ammunition was on the way to the forts; and I have al&s;o ordered a further quantity to be immedi|ately &s;ent.</P>
<P>By colonel Blaine, one of the i&s;&s;uing commi&s;&s;aries, who left Red-bank in the morning before the action, I am happily in|formed that he had thrown con&s;iderable &s;upplies of provi&s;ion into both garri&s;ons. He al&s;o adds that he came from Jer&s;ey this morning, and that the enemy had recro&s;&s;ed the Delaware and returned to Philadelphia. I have written to colonel Greene that the pri&s;oners mu&s;t be immediately &s;ent from his po&s;t: and Mr. Clymer, a deputy under Mr. Boudinot, will &s;et out to|morrow morning to make a proper di&s;po&s;ition of them.</P>
<P>It gives me great concern to inform Congre&s;s, that, after all my exertions, we are &s;till in a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation for want of blankets and &s;hoes. At this time no incon&s;iderable part of our force are incapable of acting, through the deficiency on the lat|ter: and I fear, without we can be relieved, it will be the ca&s;e with two-thirds of the army in the cour&s;e of a few days.</P>
<P>I am and have been waiting with the mo&s;t anxious impatience for a confirmation of general Burgoyne's &s;urrender. I have re|ceived

no further intelligence re&s;pecting it (excepting vague re|port) than the fir&s;t account, which came to hand &s;o long ago as &s;aturday morning.&mdash;If Congre&s;s have had authentic advices a|bout it, I wi&s;h to be favored with them.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS duly honored with Mr. Hancock's letter of the twenty-fifth, with its &s;everal inclo&s;ures.&mdash;I &s;hall take the ca&s;e of John More under con&s;ideration; and will tran&s;mit colonel Ma&s;on my determination upon the &s;ame.</P>
<P>At this time I cannot inform the commi&s;&s;ary whether any al|terations have or have not been made by general orders in the original ration e&s;tabli&s;hment. I have been under the nece&s;&s;ity, from time to time, to &s;end away my orderly books; and they are nece&s;&s;ary to be examined on the &s;ubject. However, I think it probable that a departure from the fir&s;t allowance may have been found expedient, and directed by &s;ome authority,&mdash;or the commi&s;&s;ary would not have adopted it.&mdash;In re&s;pect to the al|teration referred to my con&s;ideration, it is a matter of con&s;e|quence, and I have de&s;ired the general officers to inform them|&s;elves whether it will be agreeable to the army at large, or what other regulations may be nece&s;&s;ary in this in&s;tance.&mdash;As &s;oon as I have their &s;entiments, I will write to Congre&s;s upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The enemy &s;till con&s;ider the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our po&s;ts upon the river of great importance; and, from their preparations of fa|&s;cines, &amp;c. and the be&s;t information I have been able to obtain, they will make further efforts to carry them.&mdash;Viewing them in this light my&s;elf, and imagining that they would per&s;evere in their plans to occupy them, I wrote &s;ome days ago in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing terms to generals Dickin&s;on, Forman, and * * *, to af|ford every aid in their power from the militia of New-Jer&s;ey. As yet we have received but little; and I have no encourage|ment to expect that it will be much augmented in a &s;hort time. This does not proceed from a want of activity and exertion on the part of the two fir&s;t-mentioned gentlemen, who&s;e conduct and zea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">pon every occa&s;ion give them a claim to the public e&s;teem, but in a con&s;iderable degree to the peculiar circum&s;tan|ces of their &s;tate at this time. The apprehen&s;ions of an inva|&s;ion
<PB N="159" REF="031423_0455_0FEC5E8A1F501918">
from Staten-I&s;land keep a large proportion of the militia from the ea&s;tern and upper part of the &s;tate almo&s;t, con&s;tantly employed at and in the neighborhood of Elizabethtown, and Mr. Living&s;ton's powers, as governor, being expired,&mdash;and no provi&s;ion made (it &s;eems) for &s;uch a contingency,&mdash;there are none of &s;ufficient authority to order them out, till a new ap|pointment can be had:&mdash;at lea&s;t there is ground to &s;u&s;pect that the orders and exertions of the&s;e two gentlemen, una&s;&s;i&s;ted by civil authority, will not be attended with the advantages we wi&s;h, and which our affairs require. * * *</P>
<P>Under the&s;e circum&s;tances I have been obliged to detach a further reinforcement of continental troops under general Var|num, to maintain the two garri&s;ons, if po&s;&s;ible,&mdash;be&s;ides &s;ailors drawn from the line, to man the gallies. This detachment, when it arrives, added to the force now in the forts, will make the whole amount to &s;ixteen hundred effective rank and file &s;ent from this army.</P>
<P>After the action of the fourth ultimo at Germantown, I hop|ed we &s;hould have been in a &s;ituation to attack the enemy again on tho&s;e grounds, and with more &s;ucce&s;s than in the former in|&s;tance: but this I was not able to effect. The &s;evere rain on the &s;ixteenth of September,&mdash;the action on the fourth,&mdash;the re|moval of our &s;tores, and having to form a new elaboratory,&mdash;added to the &s;mall number of hands engaged in the bu&s;ine&s;s of it,&mdash;laid us under difficulties in the capital and e&s;&s;ential article of ammunition, that could not be &s;urmounted. Every exertion was directed to obtain &s;upplies; but (notwith&s;tanding) they were inadequate, too &s;canty, and in&s;ufficient to attempt any thing on a large and general &s;cale, before the enemy withdrew them&s;elves. With what we had, in ca&s;e an experiment had been made, fortune might have decided in our favor for the pre|&s;ent; but we &s;hould not have been afterwards in a &s;ituation to maintain the advantage we might have gained: and if a repul&s;e had taken place, and the enemy pur&s;ued,&mdash;for want of a re&s;erve, we might have been expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t imminent danger of being ruined.&mdash;The di&s;tre&s;s of the &s;oldiers for want of &s;hoes was al&s;o a powerful ob&s;tacle to the mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>I could wi&s;h that our circum&s;tances were now &s;uch as to au|thori&s;e a general attack for di&s;lodging them from the city: but I think that they are not. This al&s;o is the opinion of my general officers, upon a full and comprehen&s;ive view of matters, as Con|gre&s;s will perceive by the inclo&s;ed copy of the minutes of coun|cil on the twenty-ninth ultimo, which I have taken the liberty to tran&s;mit and lay before them.&mdash;The &s;uperiority of numbers
<PB N="160" REF="031423_0456_0FEC5E8C0C2E8F90">
the part of the enemy, in re&s;pect to regular troops,&mdash;their &s;u|perior di&s;cipline, and the redoubts and lines which they have thrown up between the two rivers and about the city,&mdash;the happy &s;tate of our affairs at the northward, and the practicabi|lity of drawing &s;uccours from thence, the con&s;equences of a defeat,&mdash;the&s;e were all motives which led to a deci&s;ion again&s;t an attack at this time.</P>
<P>I have &s;ent colonel Hamilton, one of my aides to general Gates, to give him a ju&s;t repre&s;entation of things, and to ex|plain to him the expediency of our receiving the reinforce|ments which have been determined nece&s;&s;ary, if they will not interfere with and fru&s;trate any important plans he may have formed. Indeed I cannot conceive that there is any object now remaining, that demands our attention and mo&s;t vigorous efforts &s;o much as the de&s;truction of the army in this quarter. Should we be able to effect this, we &s;hall have little to fear in future.</P>
<P>General Howe's force, according to the &s;tate now made, is more con&s;iderable than it was generally &s;uppo&s;ed to be. I did not think it quite &s;o great my&s;elf, but always imagined the common e&s;timate much too low:&mdash;nor can I po&s;itively &s;ay what it really is. However, there are &s;trong rea&s;ons to believe that it is not over-rated. After the evacuation of Germantown, an almo&s;t infinite number of &s;craps and bits of paper were found, which, being &s;eparated and arranged with great indu&s;try and care, bear the marks of genuine and authentic returns at dif|ferent periods. The manner in which they were de&s;troyed and di&s;po&s;ed of gives no room to &s;u&s;pect that it was the effect of de|&s;ign.&mdash;In addition to this, I am informed by general Putnam that he had heard a reinforcement of four regiments was com|ing round to Delaware from New-York.</P>
<P>The inclo&s;ed return will give Congre&s;s a general view of the &s;trength of this army when it was made, and a particular one of the forces of each &s;tate which compo&s;e it. By this they will perceive how greatly deficient the whole are in furni&s;hing their ju&s;t quotas.&mdash;The militia from Maryland and Virginia are no longer to be counted on:&mdash;all the former, except about two hundred, are already gone; and a few days, I expect, will produce the departure of the whole or chief part of the latter, from the importunate applications which &s;ome of them have made. Be&s;ides this diminution, I am apprehen&s;ive we &s;hall have &s;everal men added to the &s;ick li&s;t by rea&s;on of the late exce&s;&s;ive rain and want of clothes.</P>
<P>We have not yet come to any determination re&s;pecting the
<PB N="161" REF="031423_0457_0FEC5D93AB1071D0">
di&s;po&s;ition of our troops for the winter,&mdash;&s;uppo&s;ing it a matter of great importance, and that for the pre&s;ent we &s;hould be &s;i|lent upon it. The rea&s;ons will readily occur. By continuing the campaign, perhaps many &s;alutary if not deci&s;ive advantages may be derived; but it appears to me that this mu&s;t depend upon the &s;upplies of clothing which the men receive. If they cannot be accommodated in this in&s;tance, it will be difficult if not impo&s;&s;ible to do it without effecting their de&s;truction.</P>
<P>I would take the liberty to mention that I feel my&s;elf in a delicate &s;ituation with re&s;pect to the marquis La Fayette.&mdash;He is extremely &s;olicitous of having a command equal to his rank, and profe&s;&s;es very different ideas, as to the purpo&s;es of his appointment, from tho&s;e Congre&s;s have mentioned to me:&mdash;he certainly did not under&s;tand them.&mdash;I do not know in what light they will view the matter: but it appears to me, from a con&s;ideration of his illu&s;trious and importortant connections,&mdash;the attachment which he has manife&s;ted for our cau&s;e,&mdash;and the con&s;equences which his return in di&s;gu&s;t might produce,&mdash;that it will be advi&s;able to gratify him in his wi&s;hes; and the more &s;o, as &s;everal gentlemen from France, who came over un|der &s;ome a&s;&s;urances, have gone back di&s;appointed in their ex|pectations.&mdash;His conduct with re&s;pect to them &s;tands in a favor|able point of view,&mdash;having intere&s;ted him&s;elf to remove their unea&s;ine&s;s, and urged the impropriety of their making any unfa|vorable repre&s;entations upon their arrivil at home: and in all his letters, he has placed our affairs in the be&s;t &s;ituation he could.&mdash;Be&s;ides, he is &s;en&s;ible, di&s;creet in his manners, has made great proficiency in our language, and, from the di&s;po&s;ition he di&s;covered at the battle of Brandiwine, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a large &s;hare of bravery and military ardor.</P>
<P>There is a French gentleman here,&mdash;mon&s;ieur Vrigny,&mdash;in who&s;e favor the marquis &s;eems much intere&s;ted. He a&s;&s;ures me he is an officer of great merit, and, from that motive and a regard to the &s;ervice, wi&s;hes to &s;ee him promoted. The rank he holds in France, and his pre&s;ent expectations, are contained in the inclo&s;ed copy of a paper given me by the marquis, Mon|&s;ieur Vrigny al&s;o has honorable certificates of his &s;ervices, near|ly corre&s;ponding with the maquis's account of them.&mdash;If Con|gre&s;s are plea&s;ed to honor him with a commi&s;&s;ion in the army of the &s;tates, I mu&s;t try to employ him.</P>
<P>I took the liberty &s;ome &s;hort time ago to mention to Con|gre&s;s the &s;ituation of the nine fir&s;t-rai&s;ed Virginia regiments, and the term for which they &s;tand engaged; and; con&s;idering that we &s;hould &s;uffer greatly by the lo&s;s of &s;o large a part of
<PB N="162" REF="031423_0458_0FEC5E90233B5538">
our force which have been long inured to &s;ervice, I thought it advi&s;able to con&s;ult the officers commanding them, upon the mode which &s;hould appear to them be&s;t calculated to re-enli&s;t them. They accordingly met, and reported their &s;entiments in writing, a copy of which I have enclo&s;ed.&mdash;I do not know that expedients, more promi&s;ing of &s;ucce&s;s than tho&s;e they have pointed out, can be adopted.&mdash;Congre&s;s will be plea&s;ed to give the matter their earlie&s;t attention, and to favor me with their opinion by the fir&s;t opportunity, whether the indulgence and allowance they have propo&s;ed may be granted.&mdash;and, if any additional bounty may be given, what it &s;hall be.&mdash;The high &s;ums paid for &s;ub&s;titutes and draughts, of late, even in the mi|litia &s;ervice, will make this nece&s;&s;ary: for the &s;oldiers, being well app ri&s;ed of that fact, will not be induced to engage again during the war or for three years, for the u&s;ual premium.</P>
<P>I would al&s;o lay before Congre&s;s a remon&s;trance by the &s;ub|altern officers of the Virginia line, founded on a reform I thought nece&s;&s;ary to take place in the regiments from that &s;tate. The&s;e, in their e&s;tabli&s;hment, were made to con&s;i&s;t of ten companies,&mdash;two more than were a&s;&s;igned to tho&s;e of the &s;tates in general. This, and the great di&s;proportion between the officers and men, induced me to reduce them to a level with the re&s;t belonging to the continent, in order to prevent, a con&s;iderable unnece&s;&s;ary expen&s;e.&mdash;To effect this, no new promotions are to be made in the two extra companies, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the ninth and tenth, either to vacancies exi&s;ting at the time of the regulation, or to any fu|ture ones that may happen therin: and the &s;ubalterns are to remain in their rank and command, till they can be promoted in the other eight companies, and their men incorporated.&mdash;This is what they complain of.&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> have made a &s;hort &s;tate of facts, and wi&s;h Congre&s;s to determine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> and the re|mon&s;trance as they &s;hall think proper.</P>
<P>At the reque&s;t of governor Clinton I have tran&s;mitted a co|py of his letter to me, giving an account of general Vaughan's expedition up the North-river after the capture of Fort-Mont|gomery, and the de&s;truction committed by his troops in burning King&s;ton and the hou&s;es and mills on the river.&mdash;According to the late&s;t advices, they have returned again; and it is reported that they have de&s;troyed the barracks and forts, and gone to New-York:&mdash;but this is not confirmed.</P>
<P>A few days ago, Mr. Franks of Philadelphia, agent for the Briti&s;h pri&s;oners, &s;ent out &s;ix thou&s;and continental dollars to Mr. Richard Graham of Virginia, for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the He&s;&s;ian and other pri&s;oners in that &s;tate. The policy of &s;uf|fering
<PB N="163" REF="031423_0459_0FEC5E95743E09E8">
the enemy to &s;upport their pri&s;oners with money which they refu&s;e them&s;elves, and which they attempt to depreciate in every in&s;tance they po&s;&s;ibly can, appears to me very que&s;ti|onable,&mdash;and the more &s;o, as it may be counterfeited.&mdash;Be&s;ides, they have laid us under every difficulty they can devi&s;e, as to our pri&s;oners in their hands:&mdash;nothing will do for their &s;upport but hard money.&mdash;If the enemy were obliged to furni&s;h the &s;ame, the quanity with us would be greater, and of cour&s;e the means of relieving ours, ea&s;ier. I do not know what con&s;e|quences a prohibition again&s;t receiving continental money or the currency of any &s;tate from them might involve: I think the &s;ubject is worthy of the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s; and for that rea&s;on I have mentioned it.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 3.&mdash;The report of the enemy's having de&s;troyed the forts and barracks on the North-river, and of their having returned to New-York, is confirmed. I this morning received a letter from general Putnam upon the &s;ubject, a copy of which is tran&s;mitted.&mdash;The information that they mean to reinforce general Howe, I doubt not, is true: it has come through &s;eve|ral channels, and nothing is more probable.&mdash;As to their hav|ing a further expedition in view, it &s;eems to be que&s;tionable:&mdash;general Burgoyne's defeat, and the ea&s;tern troops being ready to be employed in another way, are circum&s;tances again&s;t the mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Agreeable to my expectation, the Virginia militia are gone: &s;o that we have none now in aid of the continental troops, but tho&s;e of this &s;tate mentioned in the return, and a few from Ma|ryland. I do not know what can or will be done to obtain further reinforcements of them: but it appears to me, taking matters in any point of light, that further aids &s;hould come from Virginia and Maryland: for, &s;hould we be able to accom|modate the continental forces with clothes &s;o as to carry on a winter campaign, their a&s;&s;i&s;tance will be material, either to maintain a blockade, or in any deci&s;ive &s;troke we may attempt. And if they cannot be &s;o provided, and we &s;hould be obliged to retire into quarters, their &s;ervice will be &s;till more nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;i&s;t in covering the country again&s;t incur&s;ions for forage and provi&s;ions. The militia of this &s;tate, them&s;elves, &s;uppo&s;ing they &s;hould be tolerably vigorous in their exertions, will not be equal to the ta&s;k: at lea&s;t it will be difficult, if not imprac|ticable, for them to do it. It is to be wi&s;hed that &s;uch as can be drawn out may be engaged to &s;erve three months, or two at lea&s;t (if it can be effected), after their arrival in camp; and that a mode could be adopted to &s;upply their places with others
<PB N="164" REF="031423_0460_0FEC5E9C05EC4FC8">
at the expiration of their term, &s;hould the exigency of our af|fairs require it. A time for their continuance &s;hould be fix|ed, or they will always be unea&s;y and pu&s;hing off; and the longer circum&s;tances will admit it to be, the better: for, after the period recurs, for which they come. it will be impo&s;&s;ible to retain, them a moment. As to the number that &s;hould be required, it is difficult to determine: however, it is likely it will fall &s;hort of the requi&s;ition, as it ever has upon &s;uch oc|ca&s;ions.</P>
<P>There is a report prevailing in camp, which has come through &s;everal channels, that a &s;ucce&s;sful expedition has been made upon Rhode-I&s;land, and eight hundred pri&s;oners taken, with &s;everal pieces of artillery, and a large quantity of &s;alt.&mdash;I heartily wi&s;h it may be true: but at pre&s;ent it wants confir|mation</P>
<P>Mr. Thomp&s;on's letter of the twenty-fir&s;t ultimo, with its inclo&s;ures, came to hand ye&s;terday. I join Congre&s;s mo&s;t &s;in|cerely in congratulations on our important &s;ucce&s;s in the &s;ur|render of general Burgoyne at the head of his forces, and am happy they have received a confirmation of the event from gene|ral Gates.</P>

<P>I DO my&s;elf the honor to inclo&s;e you an extract a letter from major-general Dickin&s;on, of the &s;ixth in&s;tant, by which it appears that a reinforcement has &s;ailed from New-York, ei|ther from general Howe or &s;ome other expedition. I have not yet head whether any of the troops on their march from the northward have yet cro&s;&s;ed the North-river: but I hope they will be with me near as &s;oon as general Howe's reinforcement can arrive at Philadelphia.</P>
<P>There was a heavy firing of cannon all the day of the fifth, down the river; and in the evening &s;ome mu&s;ketry was heard; from whence we concluded that an attack had been made upon Fort-Mifflin. But it turned out to be an attack made by ge|neral Varnum, with a twelve and an eighteen-pounder fixed near Red-bank, upon the enemy's &s;hips. He thinks he damag|ed the Somer&s;et of &s;ixty-four guns con&s;iderably, as &s;he got on ground, and was for &s;ome time expo&s;ed to his fire. The &s;hips were obliged to quit their &s;tations and fall lower down.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="031423_0461_0FEC5D6C21A2A438">
From a variety of accounts and circum&s;tances, I am induced to believe that the enemy are miditating a grand blow again&s;t Fort-Mifflin. I have put the place in as good a &s;tate of defence as my pre&s;ent numbers will admit, and have directed general Varnum to afford every further a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his power. I therefore hope they will meet a warm reception whenever they make the attempt.</P>
<P>The military che&s;t is again empty, and the army is unpaid for the months of September and October,&mdash;be&s;ides the draughts that are requi&s;ite for the commi&s;&s;ary and quarter-ma&s;ter-gene|ral's department. You will therefore be plea&s;ed to direct a &s;upply of ca&s;h to be &s;ent on as expediou&s;ly as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>I fear, from a letter which I have lately received from ge|neral Heath, that no proper mea&s;ures are taken to put up a &s;upply of &s;alt provi&s;ions for next campaign, to the ea&s;tward. I have inclo&s;ed a copy of general Heath's letter to Mr. Bu|chanan, the commi&s;&s;ary-general of purcha&s;es, and have de&s;ired him to have the matter looked into in time: but is of &s;o much importance to the very exi&s;tence of the army, that I think it de&s;erves the attention of Congre&s;s.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been duly honored with your favors of the fourth and fifth in&s;tant, with their &s;everal inclo&s;ures. Among tho&s;e of the former, I found the re&s;olution you are plea&s;ed to allude to, re&s;pecting your appointment as pre&s;ident. &punc;Permit me, &s;ir, to congratulate you upon this event, and to a&s;&s;ure you I have the mo&s;t entire confidence that I &s;hall experience in you during your pre&s;idency the &s;ame politene&s;s, and attention to the intere&s;ts of the &s;tates, that marked the conduct of your worthy predece&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the views of the navy-board for &s;ecuring the frigates, the &s;ituation of the army would not admit of a com|pliance with them, &s;uppo&s;ing they would an&s;wer the end. I have therefore written to te board in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing terms, to have the frigates &s;cuttled in &s;uch way that they may be rai&s;|ed when it &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary, and that in the mean time they may not be liable to injury from floating ice.&mdash;I &s;ee no mea|&s;ure &s;o likely to &s;ecure them to us, and again&s;t the enemy's at|tempts.&mdash;
<PB N="166" REF="031423_0462_0FEC5EA149FB5FC8">
I have been extremely fearful they would have po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed and employed them, with the Delaware and their batte|ries, on the rear of the gallies and the fort, while the &s;hips be|low attacked in front. I need not point out the probable con|&s;equences of &s;uch an event: they are too obvious.</P>
<P>The re&s;olves which you reque&s;t to be communicated to the ar|my &s;hall be publi&s;hed in general orders.&mdash;The letters for com|modore Hazlewood, &amp;c. have been put in a proper channel of conveyance.</P>
<P>As to the di&s;po&s;ition of part of the northern army, my letter of the fir&s;t, continued to the third, contains my ideas upon the &s;ubject, and tho&s;e my general officers. I &s;hall be &s;orry if the mea&s;ures I have taken on this head &s;hould interfere with or materially vary from any plans Congre&s;s might have had in view. Their proceedings of the fifth, I pre&s;ume, were founded on a &s;uppo&s;ition that the enemy were &s;till up the North-river, and garri&s;oning the forts they had taken.&mdash;This not being the ca&s;e, and all accounts agreeing that reinforcements to general Howe are coming from York, I hope the aides I have requir|ed will be con&s;idered expedient and proper. Independent of the latter con&s;ideration, I think our exertions and force &s;hould be directed to effect general Howe's de&s;truction if it is po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Among the various difficulties attenting the army the adju&s;t|ment of rank is not the lea&s;t. This,&mdash;owing to the &s;everal modes, the &s;everel principles, that have prevailed in granting commi&s;&s;ions,&mdash;is involving in great perplexity. The officers of the Penn&s;ylvania troops are in much confu&s;ion about it: in many in&s;tances, tho&s;e who were junior in rank, from local and other circum&s;tances, have obtained commi&s;&s;ions older in date than tho&s;e which were granted afterwards to officers, their &s;u|periors before. This, with many other irregularies, has been and is the cau&s;e of great unea&s;ine&s;s: and, though precedency of rank &s;o claimed &s;hould not be &s;upported in ju&s;tice or upon any principle,&mdash;we find all, having the lea&s;t pretext for the title, &s;trenuous to &s;upport it, and willing to hold a &s;uperiority. I was therefore induced to order a board of officers to take the matter under con&s;ideration. The re&s;ult, re&s;pecting the field-officers of this &s;tate, I now inclo&s;e, and wi&s;h Congre&s;s to adopt the regulation which the board have made, and to tran&s;mit me, by the earlie&s;t opportunity, commi&s;&s;ions dated according to their arrangement. At the &s;ame time it may be proper that there &s;hould be a re&s;olve vacating the commi&s;&s;ions they now have, and directing them to be delivered to me. Their atten|tion
<PB N="167" REF="031423_0463_0FEC5EA51D532BF0">
to this bu&s;ine&s;s, I tru&s;t, will be immediate: the di&s;putes and jealou&s;ies with the officers require it.</P>
<P>I have inclo&s;ed the memorial of colonel Portail and the other engineers for their promotion, referred to me by the board of war for my &s;entiments.&mdash;As to the terms the&s;e gentlemen men|tioned to have been propo&s;ed and agreed to when they fir&s;t ar|rived. I know nothing of them further than the memorial &s;tates. In re&s;pect to their abilities and knowledge in their profe&s;&s;ion, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve they have had no great opportunity of proving them &s;ince they were in our &s;ervice. However, I have rea&s;on to believe that they have been regularly bred in this important branch of war, and that their talents, which have been hither|to, as it were, dormant, want only a proper occa&s;ion to call them forth; in which ca&s;e, I have no doubt they would do them&s;elves honor, and the &s;tates e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice.&mdash;It is of great import|ance, too, to con&s;ider the practicability of replacing the&s;e gen|tlemen with per&s;ons equally qualified, if they &s;hould quit the &s;ervice; and how indi&s;pen&s;able men of &s;kill in this branch of military &s;cience are to every army. While I am on this &s;ub|ject, I would take the liberty to mention that I have been well informed that the engineer in the northern army (Corie&s;ki, I think, his name is) is a gentleman of &s;cience and merit. From the character I have had of him, he is de&s;erving of notice too.</P>
<P>I would beg leave to mention that we are in great di&s;tre&s;s for want of money. This will be more urgent every day: and it is probable there will be a great deal of pay due to the troops coming to reinforce us.&mdash;General Putnam writes pre&s;&s;ingly for a &s;upply, and &s;ays he is in a mo&s;t di&s;agreeable &s;ituation for the want of it.&mdash;I mu&s;t reque&s;t the attention of Congre&s;s to this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Your favor of the &s;eventh came to hand this morning. I &s;hall pay proper attention to the inclo&s;ures.&mdash;The rank of the offi|cers of cavalry I will attempt to have &s;ettled as &s;oon as circum|&s;tances will admit.</P>
<P>I have nothing very intere&s;ting to communicate.&mdash;The ene|my have lo&s;t one of their new floating batteries: it &s;unk in a little time after it was launched. There has been a cannonade to-day:&mdash;it &s;till continues:&mdash;I do not know the occa&s;ion, but imagine it is between the &s;hips and gallies.</P>

<P>The condition of the army for want of clothes and blan|kets,&mdash;and the little pro&s;pect I have of obtaining relief, accord|ing to the information I have received from the board of war,&mdash;occa&s;ion me to trouble you at this time. The mode of &s;eiz|ing and forcing &s;upplies from the inhabitants, I fear, would prove very inadequate to the demands, while it would certainly embitter the minds of the people, and excite perhaps a hurtful jealou&s;y again&s;t the army. I have had officers out for the pur|po&s;e of purcha&s;ing and making voluntary collections of nec&s;&s;a|ries; and, in a few in&s;tances, more coercive mea&s;ures have been exerci&s;ed: but all the&s;e have proved of little avail: our di&s;tre&s;|&s;es &s;till continue, and are becoming greater. I would therefore humbly &s;ubmit it to the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s whether it may not be expedient for them to addre&s;s the &s;everal legi&s;lative and executive powers of the &s;tates on this &s;ubject as early as po&s;|&s;ible, and in the mo&s;t urgent terms. It appears to me, if they were to appoint, under the authority of Congre&s;s, proper active agents, that many nece&s;&s;aries might be procured in addition to tho&s;e [<HI>purcha&s;ed</HI>] on public account. Be&s;ides this, I think the exigency of our affairs requires that they &s;hould re&s;ove on an immediate a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment to be made on the inhabitants.&mdash;If the&s;e modes were adopted, con&s;iderable aids might be derived, and in a way much le&s;s exceptionable than that of &s;eizing by the army. The a&s;&s;emblies in many &s;tates, I believe, are now &s;itting; and I have no doubt, upon a requi&s;ition by Congre&s;s, but they will give attention to the mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed you will receive a copy of a letter from general Put|nam, which came to hand to-day. You will find his and go|vernor Clinton's opinion re&s;pecting the fortifications nece&s;&s;ary to be made for the &s;ecurity of the North-river. As &s;oon as I heard that Warner's militia were coming down to reinforce me, I immediately wrote to countermand them, and directed that they &s;hould be retained to carry on the nece&s;&s;ary works during the time they are to &s;erve.&mdash;My letter on this &s;ubject was on the ninth in&s;tant.&mdash;As to the other troops, the propriety of bringing them here, I believe, is not to be que&s;tioned. We are told through various channels that &s;ir Henry Clinton is coming round with all the force that can po&s;&s;ibly be &s;pared from New-York; and it is &s;aid that tho&s;e on Staten-I&s;land are withdrawn. It is added al&s;o that the inhabitants of the former are greatly alarmed and di&s;gu&s;ted, and that general Tryon is calling in the militia of Long-I&s;land for the defence of the city.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM &s;orry to inform you that Fort-Mifflin was evacuat|ed the night before la&s;t, after a defence which does credit to the American arms, and will ever reflect the highe&s;t honor up|on the officers and men of the garri&s;on. The works were en|tirely beat down, every piece of cannon di&s;mounted, and one of the enemy's &s;hips &s;o near that &s;he threw grenades into the fort, and killed men upon the platforms, from her tops, before they quitted the i&s;land. This &s;hip had been cut down for the pur|po&s;e, and &s;o con&s;tructed that &s;he made but a &s;mall draught of water, and by the&s;e means warped in between Fort-Mifflin and Province-I&s;land. Some complaints are made that the captains of the gallies did not &s;ufficiently exert them&s;elves to drive this ve&s;&s;el from her &s;tation: but I &s;hall not determine any thing up|on the matter till a proper enquiry is made.</P>
<P>Nothing in the cour&s;e of this campaign has taken up &s;o much of the attention and con&s;ideration of my&s;elf and all the general officers, as the po&s;&s;ibility of giving a further relief to Fort-Mif|flin
<PB N="170" REF="031423_0466_0FEC5EABAF3E4CA0">
than what we had already afforded. Such a garri&s;on was thrown into it as has been found by experience capable of de|fending it to the la&s;t extremity: and Red-bank, which was deemed e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary, not only for the purpo&s;e of keep|ing open the communication, but of annoying the enemy's &s;hips and covering our own fleet, has been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a con&s;iderable detachment from this army. The only remaining and practica|ble mode of giving relief to the fort was by di&s;lodging the ene|my from Province-I&s;land, from whence they kept up an ince&s;|&s;ant fire. But this, from the &s;ituation of the ground, was not to be attempted with any degree of &s;afety to the attacking par|ty, without the whole or a con&s;iderable part of the army &s;hould be removed to the we&s;t &s;ide of Schuylkill to &s;upport and co|ver it.</P>
<P>To account for this, you mu&s;t be made acquainted with the nature of the ground. In order to have made the attack upon Province-I&s;land, the party de&s;tined for that purpo&s;e,&mdash;which &s;hould have been at lea&s;t fifteen hundred,&mdash;mu&s;t have marched down the Che&s;ter road as far as the Bell inn near Derby, and thence, turning towards Delaware, mu&s;t have proceeded about four miles further through a neck of land, to the i&s;land. The enemy have a bridge at the middle ferry upon Schuylkill, which is but four miles from the Bell inn; con&s;equently, by throwing a body of men over that bridge upon the fir&s;t di&s;covery of our de&s;ign, and marching down to the Bell, they would have effec|tually cut off our detachment upon their return.&mdash;It is true the covering party might have con&s;i&s;ted of a le&s;s number than the whole army: but then tho&s;e remaining upon this &s;ide the river would have been too few to have been intru&s;ted with all the artillery and &s;tores of the army, within twelve miles of the e|nemy.</P>
<P>There were many and very forcible rea&s;ons again&s;t a total re|move to the we&s;t &s;ide of Schuylkill. Leaving all our &s;tores at Ea&s;ton, Bethlehem, and Allentown, uncovered,&mdash;and abandon|ing &s;everal of our ho&s;pitals within reach of the enemy,&mdash;fir&s;t pre&s;ented them&s;elves. Another, and in my opinion a more weighty rea&s;on than either of the preceding, was the importance of &s;upporting the po&s;t at Red-bank, upon which that of Fort-Mifflin in a great mea&s;ure depended, as through it we &s;ent in &s;upplies of men, provi&s;ion, and ammunition. The enemy, &s;en|&s;ible of this, endeavored to di&s;lodge us from Red-bank on the twenty-&s;econd of la&s;t month; which, as Congre&s;s have been in|formed, co&s;t them four hundred men.</P>
<P>Now, had our army been on the we&s;t &s;ide of Schuylkill, they
<PB N="171" REF="031423_0467_0FEC5D97A3C90A90">
might, without any danger of an attack upon their lines, have thrown over of con&s;iderable a force into Jer&s;ey, that they might have overpowered the garri&s;on, and, by making them&s;elves ma&s;|ters of it, have reduced Fort-Mifflin by famine or want of am|munition. Thus we &s;hould in all probability have lo&s;t both po&s;ts by one &s;troke.&mdash;They might al&s;o, by taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fords upon Schuylkill, have rendered the junction of our northern reinforcements with us a very difficult, if not an im|practicable matter: and, &s;hould any accident have happened to them, we &s;hould have &s;tood a very poor chance of looking ge|neral Howe in the face through the winter with an inferior ar|my. We &s;hould finally have thrown the army into &s;uch a &s;i|tuation, that we mu&s;t inevitable have drawn on a general en|gagement before our reinforcements arrived; which, con&s;ider|ing our di&s;parity of numbers, would probably have ended with the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable con&s;equences.</P>
<P>It was therefore determined a few days ago to wait the arri|val of the reinforcement from the northward before any altera|tion could &s;afely be made in the di&s;po&s;ition of the army: and I was not without hopes that the fort would have held out till that time.&mdash;That we might then have moved without endan|gering the &s;tores, I had-given orders for the removal of them, from the places before mentioned, to Lebanon and other places in Lanca&s;ter county, which is at any rate more &s;afe and conve|nient than where they were.</P>
<P>As the keeping po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Red-bank, and thereby &s;till preventing the enemy from weighing the chevaux-de-fri&s;e be|fore the fro&s;t obliges their &s;hips to quit the river, has become a matter of the greate&s;t importance, I have determined to &s;end down general St. Clair, general Knox, and baron Kalb, to take a view of the ground, and to endeavor to form a judgment of the mo&s;t probable means of &s;ecuring it. They will at the &s;ame time &s;ee how far it is po&s;&s;ible for our fleet to keep their &s;ta|tion &s;ince the lo&s;s of Fort-Mifflin, and al&s;o make the proper in|quiry into the conduct of the captains of the gallies, mentioned in the former part of this letter.</P>
<P>I am informed that it is matter of amazement, and that re|flections have been thrown out again&s;t this army, for not being more active and enterpri&s;ing than, in the opinion of &s;ome, they ought to have been. If the charge is ju&s;t, the be&s;t way to ac|count for it, will be to refer you to the returns of our &s;trength, and tho&s;e which I can produce of the enemy, and to the inclo&s;|ed ab&s;tract of the clothing now actually wanting for the army: and then I think the wonder will be, how they keep the field
<PB N="172" REF="031423_0468_0FEC5EAE616B5FC8">
at all in tents at this &s;ea&s;on of the year.&mdash;What &s;tock the clo|thier-general has to &s;upply this demand, or what are his pro&s;|pects, he him&s;elf will inform you, as I have directed him to go to York-town to lay the&s;e matters before Congre&s;s. There are, be&s;ides, mo&s;t of tho&s;e in the ho&s;pitals more bare than tho&s;e in the field:&mdash;many remain there for want of clothes only.</P>
<P>Several general officers, unable to procure clothing in the common line, have employed agents to purcha&s;e up what could be found in different parts of the country. General Wayne, among others, has employed Mr. Zantzinger of Lanca&s;ter, who has purcha&s;ed to the amount of four thou&s;and five hundred pounds, for which he de&s;ires a draught upon the trea&s;ury-board.&mdash;Inclo&s;ed you have a copy of his letter.&mdash;I am not clear whe|ther this application &s;hould properly be made to the trea&s;ury, or the clothier-general, who &s;hould charge the money to the regiments for whom the clothes are, as &s;o much advanced to them. If the latter &s;hould appear the mo&s;t proper mode, I will order it to be done.</P>
<P>I am anxiou&s;ly waiting the arrival of the troops from the northward, who ought, from the time they have had my or|ders, to have been here before this. Colonel Hamilton, one of my aides, is up the North-river, doing all he can to pu&s;h them forward: but he writes me word that he finds many un|accountable delays thrown in his way. However I am in hopes that many days will not elap&s;e before a brigade or two, at lea&s;t, arrive.&mdash;The want of the&s;e troops has embarra&s;&s;ed all my mea|&s;ures exceedingly.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been duly honored with your favors of the thir|teenth and nineteenth in&s;tant with their inclo&s;ures.&mdash;I am well a&s;&s;ured Congre&s;s have not been inattentive to the nece&s;&s;ities of the army: and that the deficiency in our &s;upplies, particularly in the article of clothing, has ari&s;en from the difficulty of im|porting, on account of the numerous fleet that line our coa&s;t. However I am per&s;uaded that con&s;iderable relief might be drawn from the different &s;tates, were they to exert them&s;elves
<PB N="173" REF="031423_0469_0FEC5D9B8F704928">
properly. This I hope will be the ca&s;e as &s;oon as they receive the pre&s;&s;ing recommendations of Congre&s;s upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>It has been the unvaried cu&s;tom of the enemy, from the commencement of the pre&s;ent conte&s;t, to try every artifice and device to delude the people. The me&s;&s;age through John Brown was calculated for this end. I am &s;urpri&s;ed Mr Willing &s;hould &s;uffer him&s;elf to be impo&s;ed on by &s;uch flim&s;y mea&s;ures. He knows that there is a plain obvious way for general and lord Howe to communicate any propo&s;als they wi&s;h to make, to Congre&s;s, without the intervention of a &s;econd and third hand. But this would not &s;uit their views.&mdash;I am &s;orry that Mr. Brown &s;hould be the bearer of the me&s;&s;age; as, from the cha|racter I have had of him, he is a worthy, well-di&s;po&s;ed man. It has been frequently mentioned that he had intere&s;ted him|&s;elf much in behalf of our pri&s;oners, and had afforded them e|very relief and comfort his circum&s;tances would allow him to give.</P>
<P>I have been endeavoring to effect an exchange of pri&s;oners, from principles of ju&s;tice, and from motives of humanity: but at pre&s;ent I have no pro&s;pect of it. Yet general Howe has a&s;|&s;ured our officers it was his wi&s;h, and, if it could not be done, that he &s;hould readily agree to their relea&s;e on parole.&mdash;The inclo&s;ed copies of my letters and his an&s;wer will &s;hew Congre&s;s what has pa&s;&s;ed between us upon that &s;ubject; and at the &s;ame time, that I had remon&s;trated again&s;t the &s;evere and cruel treatment of the pri&s;oners, and propo&s;ed the plan of &s;ending in a &s;uitable per&s;on to inquire into the facts, before the receipt of their re&s;olution. Their &s;ufferings, I am per&s;uaded, have been great, and &s;hocking to humanity. I have called upon general Howe for redre&s;s, and an explicit an&s;wer to my letter of the fourteenth. If I do not receive one by to-morrow night, with the mo&s;t po&s;itive and &s;atisfactory a&s;&s;urances that a proper con|duct &s;hall be ob&s;erved towards them in future, we mu&s;t retali|ate, however much we wi&s;h to avoid &s;everity, and mea&s;ures that bear the &s;malle&s;t appearance of rigor or inhumanity.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed you will receive a li&s;t of &s;undry officers who have been ca&s;hiered &s;ince the action of the fourth ultimo.&mdash;I flatter my&s;elf that the&s;e examples will involves many favorable and beneficial con&s;equences.&mdash;Be&s;ides the&s;e, there were many more brought to trial, who were acquitted; among them, general Maxwell, and general Wayne,&mdash;the former for charges again&s;t him while he commanded the light troops,&mdash;the latter for charges again&s;t his conduct in the attack made on his divi&s;ion, in the night of the twentieth of September. The re&s;ult of the

<P>I am &s;orry to inform Congre&s;s that the enemy are now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the water defences.&mdash;Fort-Mifflin and that at Red-bank mutually depended on each other for &s;upport; and the reduction of the former made the tenure of the latter ex|tremely precarious, if not impracticable. After the lo&s;s of Fort-Mifflin, it was found Red-bank could derive no advantages from the gallies and armed ve&s;&s;els&mdash;(they could not maintain their &s;tation)&mdash;and, in ca&s;e of inve&s;titure, the garri&s;on could have no &s;upplies, no retreat, nor any hope of relief, but &s;uch as might ari&s;e from a &s;uperior force acting without on the rear of the enemy, and di&s;lodging them. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, the garri&s;on was obliged to evacuate it on the night of the twentieth in&s;tant, on the approach of lord Cornwallis who had cro&s;&s;ed the river from Che&s;ter with a detachment. &s;uppo&s;ed to be about two thou&s;and men, and formed a junction with the troops lately arrived from New-York, and tho&s;e that had been landed before at Billing&s;port.</P>
<P>From general Varnum's account, I have rea&s;on to hope that we &s;aved mo&s;t of the &s;tores, except a few heavy cannon: how|ever I cannot be particular in this in&s;tance.&mdash;I am al&s;o to add, from the intelligence I have received, that mo&s;t if not all the armed ve&s;&s;els have been burned by our own people, except the gallies, one brig, and two &s;loops, which are &s;aid to have run by the city.&mdash;How far this might be founded in nece&s;&s;ity, I am not able to determine; but I &s;uppo&s;e it was done under that idea, and an apprehen&s;ion of their falling into the enemy's hands if they attempted to pa&s;s up the river.</P>
<P>Upon the fir&s;t information I had of lord Cornwallis's move|ment, I detached general Huntington's brigade to join general Varnum, and, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, general, Greene with his divi|&s;ion; hoping that the&s;e,&mdash;with Glover's brigade which was on the march through Jer&s;ey, and which I directed to file off to the left for the &s;ame purpo&s;e,&mdash;and with &s;uch militia as could be collected,&mdash;would be able to defeat the enemy's de&s;ign, and to pre&s;erve the fort. But they were &s;o rapid in their advances, that our troops could not form a juction and arrive in time to &s;uccour the garri&s;on; which obliged them to withdraw.</P>
<P>General Greene is &s;till in Jer&s;ey; and when Glover's bri|gade joins him, if an attack can be made on lord Cornwallis

with a pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, I am per&s;uaded it will be done. A|bout a hundred and &s;eventy of Morgan's corps are al&s;o gone to reinforce him.</P>
<P>Generals Poor and Patter&s;on with their brigades, and colonel Bailey with Learned's, are now in camp. The la&s;t arrived on friday evening, the other two in the cour&s;e of ye&s;terday. I have not yet obtained returns of their &s;trength; but, from the accounts of the officers, they will amount in the whole to twen|ty-three or twenty-four hundred rank and file.

<P>I WAS ye&s;terday morning honored with your favors of the twenty-&s;econd in&s;tant.&mdash;I wi&s;h the mea&s;ures Congre&s;s have adopted may effectually &s;uppre&s;s the di&s;turbances in the we&s;tern department. Should they prove &s;ucce&s;sful and the &s;avages and wicked deluded inhabitants receive a &s;evere check, it is proba|ble they will not be induced again to take part again&s;t us, or at lea&s;t for &s;ome con&s;iderable time. Colonel Crawford &s;et out ye&s;terday evening, and will be with Congre&s;s I expect, in the cour&s;e of two or three days to take their commands.</P>
<P>I was much obliged by the foreign intelligence you were plea&s;ed to tran&s;mit me: it is agreeable and intere&s;ting: and I heartily wi&s;h there may be an early declaration of ho&s;tilities between France and Britain. From the&s;e advices, things &s;eem to be getting into a proper train for it: and it is not ea&s;ily to be conceived that it can be much longer delayed. However our expectations have not been an&s;wered in this in&s;tance, and they may yet be held in &s;u&s;pen&s;e. The political rea&s;ons, that lead to delay on the part of France, I do not perfectly under|&s;tand. As to Britain, her honor is lo&s;t in the conte&s;t with us, and the mo&s;t indignant in&s;ults will &s;carcely be able to draw her attention from her pre&s;ent pur&s;uits.&mdash;The account of Mr. Lee having effected the purpo&s;es of his emba&s;&s;y at the court of Berlin is of great importance, if it be true. In &s;uch ca&s;e,

<P>I mu&s;t take the liberty to reque&s;t the deci&s;ion of Congre&s;s on the ca&s;e of the nine fir&s;t-rai&s;ed Virginia regiments as early as circum&s;tances will permit. If the plan propo&s;ed for re-en|li&s;ting them is judged expedient, one capital inducement to that end, &s;ugge&s;ted by the officers, will cea&s;e if it is longer delayed. It is a matter of con&s;iderable importance, and of which I wi&s;h to be &s;atisfied as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.&mdash;I &s;hould al&s;o be happy in their determination re&s;pecting the marquis De la Fayette. He is more and more &s;olicitous to be in actual &s;ervice, and is pre&s;&s;|ing in his applications for a command.&mdash;I ventured before to &s;ubmit my &s;entiments upon the mea&s;ure; and I &s;till fear a re|fu&s;al will not only induce him to return in di&s;gu&s;t, but may in|volve &s;ome unfavorable con&s;equences.&mdash;There are now &s;ome vacant divi&s;ions in the army, to one of which he may be ap|pointed, if it &s;hould be the plea&s;ure of Congre&s;s. I am con|vinced he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a large &s;hare of that military ardor which generally characteri&s;es the nobility of his country. He went to Jer&s;ey with general Greene, and I find he has not been in|active there. This you will perceive by the following extract from a letter ju&s;t received from general Greene.</P>
<P>"The marquis, with about four hundred militia and the rifle corps, attacked the enemy's piquet la&s;t evening, killed a|bout twenty, wounded many more, and took about twenty pri|&s;oners. The marquis is charmed with the &s;pirited behavior of the militia and rifle corps:&mdash;they drove the enemy about half a mile, and kept the ground until dark. The enemy's piquet con&s;i&s;ted of about three hundred, and were reinforced during the &s;kirmi&s;h.&mdash;The marquis is determined to be in the way of danger."</P>
<P>* * * I mu&s;t reque&s;t you to tran&s;mit me a number of bank commi&s;&s;ions as &s;oon as you have an opportunity to do it. There are &s;everal vacancies yet to fill; and the officers entitled to them are anxious to be appointed. The commi&s;&s;ions I want &s;hould be under your &s;ignature, and not Mr. Hancock's. I mention this, le&s;t you &s;hould &s;end any of the latter that might remain. Tho&s;e &s;igned by you will be competent to all ca&s;es: tho&s;e by Mr Hancock, only to &s;uch as happened during his pre|&s;idency; and of the&s;e I have now &s;ome.</P>

<P>ON &s;aturday I had the honor to receive your favor of the twenty-&s;ixth ultimo with its inclo&s;ures.&mdash;The re&s;olve of the twenty-fifth I have buli&s;hed in orders, agreeable to direction, and &s;hall be happy if Congre&s;s can fall upon mea&s;ures to render the &s;ituation of the officers and &s;oldiery more eligible than what it now is. At pre&s;ent it is truly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing: and, unle&s;s &s;ome means can be devi&s;ed to &s;upport them more comfortably, we &s;hall have to apprehend the mo&s;t alarming con&s;equences. The officers, or at lea&s;t a large proportion of them, as well as the men, are in a mo&s;t di&s;agreeable condition as to clothing, and without any certain pro&s;pect of relief: and, what is &s;till more painful,&mdash;if perchance they have an opportunity of purcha&s;ing (which is &s;eldom the ca&s;e), they have the mortification to find them&s;elves totally incompetent to it, from the depreciation of our money, and the exorbitant prices demanded for all articles in this way.&mdash;This is the &s;ource of great unea&s;ine&s;s, of indiffer|ence to the &s;ervice, and of repeated (I may &s;ay, daily) applica|tions to leave it, and the&s;e too by as good officers as are in the American line.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to promotions for merit and intrepidity, I would beg leave to ob&s;erve, that, though the&s;e are proper con&s;idera|tions to found them upon, yet they &s;hould be made with the greate&s;t caution and attention, and only in ca&s;es of the mo&s;t e|minent and di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;ervices. Every promotion or ri&s;e out of common cour&s;e cannot fail to excite unea&s;ine&s;s in a great|er or le&s;&s;er degree: and nothing will reconcile them to the ar|my

<P>Before the receipt of your favor, I do not recollect to have heard of John Simper's ca&s;e. His brother has not been with me. As &s;oon as he arrives, I &s;hall give directions for him to be relea&s;ed from his pre&s;ent confinement, and to be forwarded to Cecil county.</P>
<P>I have nothing material to inform Congre&s;s of.&mdash;Lord Corn|wallis and the detachment under his command (mentioned in my la&s;t) returned from Jer&s;ey on thur&s;day.&mdash;We had rea&s;on to expect an attack &s;ince, from our advices from the city, but have been di&s;appointed.&mdash;General Greene has al&s;o joined me with all the troops that were with him, except Huntington's brigade, which will be in to-day.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the honor to inform you, that, in the cour&s;e of la&s;t week, from a variety of intelligence, I had rea&s;on to expect that general Howe was preparing to give us a general action. Accordingly, on thur&s;day night he moved from the city with all his force, except a very incon&s;iderable part left in his lines and redoubts,&mdash;and appeared the next morning on Che&s;nut-hill, in front of, and about three miles di&s;tant from, our right wing. As &s;oon as their po&s;ition was di&s;covered, the Penn&s;ylvania mili|tia were ordered from our right, to &s;kirmi&s;h with their light advanced parties; and I am &s;orry to mention that brigadier-general Irvine who led them on had the misfortune to be wounded and to be made pri&s;oner.&mdash;Nothing more occurred on that day.</P>
<P>On friday night, the enemy changed their ground, and moved to our left, within a mile of our line, where they remained qui|et and advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted the whole of the next day. On &s;unday they inclined &s;till further to our left; and, from every appearance, there was rea&s;on to apprehend they were deter|mined on an action.&mdash;In this movement, their advanced and flanking parties were warmly attacked by colonel Morgan and his corps, and al&s;o by the Maryland militia under colonel Gi&s;t. Their lo&s;s I cannot a&s;certain: but I am informed it was con&s;i|derable,
<PB N="179" REF="031423_0475_0FEC5EC01A69A090">
having regard to the number of the corps who engaged them.&mdash;About &s;un-&s;et after various marches and counter-march|es, they halted; and I &s;till &s;uppo&s;ed, from their di&s;po&s;ition and preceding manoeuvres, that they would attack us in the night or early the next morning: but in this I was mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>On monday afternoon they began to move again, and, in&s;tead of advancing, filed off from their right: and the fir&s;t certain ac|count that I could obtain of their intentions was that they were in full march towards Philadelphia by two or three routes.&mdash;I immediate detached light parties after them to fall upon their rear: but they were not able to come up with them.</P>
<P>The enemy's lo&s;s, as I have ob&s;erved, I cannot a&s;certain. One account from the city is that five hundred wounded had been &s;ent in; another is that eighty-two waggons had gone in with men in this &s;ituation. The&s;e, I fear, are both exaggerated, and not to be depended upon.&mdash;We lo&s;t twenty-&s;even men in Morgan's corps, killed and wounded, be&s;ides major Morris, a brave and gallant officer, who is among the latter. Of the Maryland militia there were al&s;o &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen wounded. I have not received further returns yet.</P>
<P>I &s;incerely wi&s;h that they had made an attack, as the i&s;&s;ue, in all probability,&mdash;from the di&s;po&s;ition of our troops, and the &s;trong &s;ituation of our camp,&mdash;would have been fortunate and happy. At the &s;ame time I mu&s;t add, that rea&s;on, prudence, and every principle of policy, forbad us quitting our po&s;t to at|tack them. Nothing but &s;ucce&s;s would have ju&s;tified the mea|&s;ure: and this could not be expected from their po&s;ition.</P>
<P>The con&s;tant attention and watching I was obliged to give the enemy's movements would not allow me to write before: and this I believe was the le&s;s material, as I have rea&s;on to think your committee who were in camp mo&s;t of the time, and who are now here, tran&s;mitted an account of &s;uch occur|rences as they deemed important in any degree. The fir&s;t cau&s;e too, &s;ir, and my engagements with the committee previ|ous to the coming out of the enemy, will, I tru&s;t, &s;ufficiently apologi&s;e for my not acknowledging before the honor of your favors of the thirtieth ultimo and the fir&s;t in&s;tant, which came to hand in due order and time.</P>

For example, all officers and men on furlough, though they &s;hould have been long from their homes before,&mdash;perhaps much longer in many in&s;tances, than many who remain,&mdash;and who&s;e private nece&s;&s;ities oblige them to be ab&s;ent,&mdash;tho&s;e who have fallen &s;ick from their &s;ervices, and who are in ho&s;pitals or in the country,&mdash;detachments on command,&mdash;the&s;e would be excluded. Such di&s;criminations, I believe, will give great di&s;gu&s;t and unea&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;It is diffi|cult, in ca&s;es of this nature, to draw a proper line of di&s;tinc|tion, and impo&s;&s;ible to do it in &s;uch a way as to give &s;atisfac|tion.</P>
<P>I do not mean to enlarge upon the &s;ubject: my only wi&s;h is to have it preci&s;ely a&s;certained, who are to be included and paid, and who are not, under the re&s;olves, that I may not on the one hand act contrary to the public intention, and on the other give cau&s;e of complaint, and perhaps do wrong to indivi|duals.</P>
<P>Knowing the difficulty of drawing a proper line, and the di&s;|gu&s;t and murmurings that ever attend di&s;criminations,&mdash;were I to advi&s;e upon the &s;ubject, only &s;uch officers and men &s;hould be excluded (&s;ince extra pay has been determined on) as are ab|&s;ent from camp without regular authority, or &s;uch as may abu&s;e indulgencies regularly obtained.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved by &s;ome, and perhaps with propriety, that there are officers and men now in camp, or who may be &s;hortly in, who have no &s;uperior claim to merit,&mdash;who&s;e affairs are not &s;o pre&s;&s;ing, or who have already had indulgencies,&mdash;or who, from their being nearer their friends and connections, have had opportunities of &s;eeing them frequently, of ordering their concerns, and vi&s;iting their homes once, twice, or perhaps oftener in the campaign.&mdash;whil&s;t they who were more remote were precluded from any of the&s;e advantages, and were con|&s;tantly on duty. The&s;e con&s;iderations will have their weight in the &s;cale of di&s;gu&s;t with the parties intere&s;ted.&mdash;For my part,
<PB N="183" REF="031423_0479_0FEC5ECE5CA23728">
though the re&s;olves were founded in principles of genero&s;ity,&mdash;were intended to reward merit, and promote the &s;ervice,&mdash;from the difficulties attending the execution, I wi&s;h they had never been made, e&s;pecially as I believe officers and men would in a little time have become tolerably well reconciled to their quar|ters.</P>

<P>AS I do not recollect with preci&s;ion whether any, or what re&s;olutions have been made by Congre&s;s re&s;pecting cap|tures by the army or detachments of it, and not having all their proceedings with me, with which I have been honored from time to time to a&s;&s;i&s;t my enquiries upon the &s;ubject,&mdash;I mu&s;t take the liberty to reque&s;t that they will determine, and favor me with their deci&s;ions upon, the following points:</P>
<P N="1">1. What articles captured are to be con&s;idered as public pro|perty?</P>
<P N="2">2. Whether articles captured by parties or detachments, not determined public property, are to be di&s;tributed or &s;old for the benefit of the army at large, or are to be con&s;idered as the &s;ole and exclu&s;ive right of the captors?</P>
<P N="3">3. If, in general in&s;tances, &s;uch articles as are taken, and which are not con&s;idered public property, are determined to be the &s;ole and exclu&s;ive right of the captors,&mdash;are &s;tationary de|tachments, who, from their &s;ituation, have much more than a common chance of making prizes, to be con&s;idered upon the &s;ame footing?</P>
<P N="4">4. If there is to be a di&s;tinction between &s;tationary and other detachments,&mdash;and the former are denied an exclu&s;ive right to the captures they make,&mdash;what proportion of the articles are they to have?</P>
<P>I have been induced to &s;tate the above que&s;tions on account of &s;ome difficulties that have ari&s;en re&s;pecting the prize taken by the detachment at Wilmington under general Smallwood, that the &s;ame may be determined, and certain principles e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, to govern in like and future ca&s;es.&mdash;In the in&s;tance of this prize, as the baggage taken (from general Smallwood's and the officers' repre&s;entation) will be but incon&s;iderable when divided among them&s;elves, I have con&s;ented that they &s;hall have it at a ju&s;t apprai&s;ement and di&s;tribution, and have directed him to have the whole, and the value, properly inven|toried,
<PB N="184" REF="031423_0480_0FEC5ED765F94C58">
that &s;uch order may be made re&s;pecting the latter, as the deci&s;ions of Congre&s;s may ju&s;tify and point out. I have al&s;o directed the &s;ale of the brig, as I under&s;tand &s;ome offers have been made for her, and as her &s;ituation may be con&s;idered hazardous and precarious.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the brig taken at Wilmington, a ve&s;&s;el has &s;tranded at Reedy-I&s;land with goods on board. It is &s;aid a quantity of rum, &s;ome bales of cloth, a number of hats, and &s;ome other ar|ticles (all wanted by the army), have been taken out of her by the militia, particularly tho&s;e of Kent county. The&s;e general Smallwood is endeavoring to find, that they may be of public benefit.</P>

<P>THIS will be delivered to you by the chevalier De Mau|duit du Ple&s;&s;is, who was among the fir&s;t French officers that joined the army of the United States. The gallant conduct of this young gentlemen at Brandiwine, Germantown, and his di&s;|dingui&s;hed &s;ervices at Fort-Mercer where he united the offices of engineer and commandant of artillery, entitle him to the particular notice of Congre&s;s.&mdash;He made &s;everal judicious al|terations in the works at Red-bank, &s;hewed great good conduct during the action in which the He&s;&s;ians were repul&s;ed, and was &s;poken of, in con&s;equence, in terms of the highe&s;t applau&s;e, by the commanding officer of the po&s;t.&mdash;After the evacuation was determined upon, he became the means of &s;aving &s;ome valuable artillery and &s;tores, and cheerfully undertook, as volunteer, the hazardous operation of blowing up the magazine, &amp;c. without the apparatus u&s;ually provided upon &s;uch occa&s;ions.&mdash;I mu&s;t further add in mon&s;ieur Du Ple&s;&s;is' favor, that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a de|gree of mode&s;ty not always found in men who have performed brilliant actions. It is with plea&s;ure therefore that I recom|mend it to Congre&s;s to grant him a brevet of lieutenant-colo|nel,&mdash;a reward due to his merit, and which will not have the inconvenience of occa&s;ioning any di&s;&s;atisfaction in the corps to which he belongs.</P>
<P>As &s;ome particular circum&s;tances have prevented mon&s;ieur Du Ple&s;&s;is waiting upon Congre&s;s &s;ooner, I hope there will be no difficulty in antedating the bre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">et, &s;o that the recompen&s;e may more immediately follow the &s;ervices which he has done.

<P>I HAVE been duly honored with your favor of the third in&s;tant, and with its inclo&s;ures.</P>
<P>As general M'Dougall's late &s;evere illne&s;s and pre&s;ent feeble &s;tate will not permit him to proceed on the intended excur&s;ion into Canada, baron De Kalb will follow the marquis agreeable to his wi&s;h and the direction of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>According to the promi&s;e contained in my la&s;t, I take the liberty to tran&s;mit you copies of &s;uch letters as have lately pa&s;&s;|ed between general Howe and my&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 12.&mdash;Since writing the above I have received ano|ther letter from general Howe, of the fifth in&s;tant, a copy of which, and of my an&s;wer, you have al&s;o inclo&s;ed. By the&s;e you will perceive that he has propo&s;ed a general exchange of pri&s;oners, and that I have acceded to it.&mdash;I have written to Mr. Boudinot, commi&s;&s;ary in this line, requiring his return to camp; and &s;hall give him directions to pur&s;ue the mo&s;t &s;peedy mea&s;ures for accompli&s;hing this bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;o intere&s;ting to the unhappy officers and men in general Howe's hands, and to the cau&s;e of humanity.&mdash;There are &s;ome other matters, as you will di&s;cover, which I could not enter upon.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of the affairs of the army has not till lately made it convenient to go into the inquiry directed by the re|&s;olve of the twenty-eighth of November, of the lo&s;&s;es of the Forts Montgomery and Clinton in the &s;tate of New-York, and
<PB N="187" REF="031423_0483_0FEC5EDEA38FD9F0">
of Fort-Mifflin on Delaware. With re&s;pect to the two former, it happens that almo&s;t all the principal officers acting in that quarter were in &s;ome way or other &s;o far concerned in the af|fair, as to make them improper for pro&s;ecuting the inquiry; I therefore propo&s;e to &s;end officers from this army. If his health will permit, I &s;hould wi&s;h general M'Dougall to pre&s;ide. His thorough knowledge of tho&s;e po&s;ts and all their connections qualifies him in a peculiar manner for the purpo&s;e.&mdash;I have written to him on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to Fort-Mifflin, the inquiry involves very ex|ten&s;ive con&s;iderations, and more or le&s;s, affects almo&s;t all the general officers in this army, who&s;e advice and concurrence in the mea&s;ures taken make them in &s;ome degree parties. The mode, in my opinion, mo&s;t unexceptionable, to be pur&s;ued, is for Congre&s;s to authori&s;e a committee of their own body, or to delegate any other per&s;ons they may chu&s;e to entru&s;t, not con|nected with the operations of this army, to go into the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>February</HI> 14.&mdash;Your &s;everal favors of the &s;eventh, and that of the eighth in&s;tant, were duly received ye&s;terday evening.&mdash;As &s;oon as circum&s;tances will admit, I &s;hall appoint a court-mar|tial in the ca&s;e directed, and &s;hall notify the parties concerned of the &s;ame.&mdash;The oath, which Congre&s;s have pre&s;cribed to be taken by the officers of the army, I &s;hall publi&s;h in general or|ders, and the mode how it is to be done, with directions about the certificates.&mdash;I &s;hall extend colonel Dyer's furlough to the fir&s;t of April, as required.</P>

<P>I AM now to acknowledge the honor of your &s;everal favors of the eightenth, nineteenth, and twenty-fir&s;t in&s;tant, which, with their re&s;pective inclo&s;ures, have been duly re|ceived.</P>
<P>In compliance with the re&s;olution of Congre&s;s of the fifth in&s;tant, tran&s;mitted in your letter of the &s;eventh, I was about to take mea&s;ures for appointing a court-martial and bringing on the trials which they direct. But on recurring to the pa|pers you were plea&s;ed to &s;end me, I do not find that the com|mittee have made any particular charges again&s;t the officers who are to be the objects of trial. It was probably the inten|tion of Congre&s;s that the&s;e charges &s;hould be laid by me. But as I might err in doing it, and not fully corre&s;pond with their
<PB N="188" REF="031423_0484_0FEC47AF991AC200">
views in the matter,&mdash;e&s;pecially as it would require con&s;idera|ble time and thought to make my&s;elf &s;ufficiently acquainted with it from the papers collected,&mdash;I &s;hould think it would be mo&s;t advi&s;able for Congre&s;s to &s;tate explicitly the charges they wi&s;h to have exhibited again&s;t the officers re&s;pectively; and then the bu&s;ine&s;s may be proceeded on with propriety.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the above rea&s;ons which operate generally again&s;t my exhibiting the charges,&mdash;in the particular in&s;tance of gene|ral Schuyler, it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to do it, as I do not know what in&s;tructions he had received from Congre&s;s from time to time as to the objects of his command, nor preci&s;ely what the&s;e were. The&s;e appear to me nece&s;&s;ary to be known, and e&s;&s;ential to carry on a pro&s;ecution again&s;t him.</P>
<P>When Congre&s;s &s;hall have arranged the&s;e points, and are plea&s;ed to honor me with them, I will pur&s;ue the &s;peedie&s;t mea|&s;ures to bring on the trials.&mdash;The &s;ooner this can be done, the better, as &s;ome of the parties are extremely anxious, and &s;trong|ly importune it.</P>
<P>Baron Steuben has arrived at camp. He appears to be much of a gentleman, and, as far as I have had an opportunity of judging, a man of military knowledge, and acquainted with the world.</P>
<P>The inclo&s;ed extract of a letter from general Putnam will &s;hew how great the di&s;tre&s;&s;es are in that quarter for want of money. He has de&s;cribed their nece&s;&s;ities &s;o fully, that it is unnece&s;&s;ary for me to add upon the &s;ubject: I &s;hall only ob&s;erve that his account is more than ju&s;tified by many other letters, and that I am per&s;uaded the earlie&s;t po&s;&s;ible &s;upply will be for|warded, that the very important and intere&s;ting works carrying on there may not be the lea&s;t retarded.</P>
<P>I am under &s;ome embarra&s;&s;ments re&s;pecting the thirteenth Virginia regiment. It was rai&s;ed on the we&s;t &s;ide of the Alle|gany and towards Pitt&s;burg, with a&s;&s;urances from the officers, it is &s;aid, that the men &s;hould not be drawn from that quarter. This circum&s;tance, added to the di&s;turbances by the Indians, and the expo&s;ed &s;ituation of their families, has been the cau&s;e of great de&s;ertions, and is at pre&s;ent the &s;ource of much unea&s;ine&s;s, and the more &s;o, as part of the regiment was never marched from thence.&mdash;I think the whole &s;hould be united either here or there, and wi&s;h Congre&s;s to direct me upon the &s;ubject.&mdash;At the &s;ame time that their ca&s;e, if truly repre&s;ented, &s;eems to be hard, and to merit the indulgence they claim, I would ob|&s;erve that the twelfth regiment from the we&s;tern parts of the &s;ame &s;tate, and the eighth and twelfth Penn&s;ylvania from the
<PB N="189" REF="031423_0485_0FEC5DACAF97E238">
frontier counties of this, have &s;imilar preten&s;ions, and might become unea&s;y, and apply for a like indulgence.</P>
<P>Agreeable to the directions of Congre&s;s, I &s;hall &s;end a major-general to Rhode-I&s;land though the number of officers here of this rank, from one cau&s;e and another, is greatly reduced, and more &s;o than it ought to be in point of policy.</P>
<P>Our lo&s;s of matro&s;&s;es, the la&s;t campaign, in killed and wound|ed, was con&s;iderable; and it has not been a little increa&s;ed this winter by de&s;ertions from colonel Proctor's corps. From the&s;e circum&s;tances, we are very weak in this line; and I reque&s;t that Congre&s;s will be plea&s;ed to order colonel Harri&s;on's regiment of artillery to march from Virginia as early as the roads will admit, and join this army.</P>

<P>I TAKE the liberty of tran&s;mitting you copies of three, letters from general Howe, of the fourteenth and twenty-fir&s;t ultimo, and of the &s;econd in&s;tant, with their inclo&s;ures. The unhappy violation of the flag of truce has laid us under no &s;mall embarra&s;&s;ments, and has afforded the enemy good grounds for complaint and triumph at the &s;ame time. This however is the natural con&s;equence, and mu&s;t ever be the ca&s;e, where different powers counteract each other in matters of the mo&s;t delicate importance. There are &s;ome circum&s;tances attending this affair, which it may po&s;&s;ibly be in the power of Congre&s;s to throw light upon.&mdash;If they can, I &s;hall be obliged by their a&s;|&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 8.&mdash;In con&s;equence of the letters which have lately pa&s;&s;ed between general Howe and my&s;elf,&mdash;particularly tho&s;e of the fifth and tenth ultimo, copies of which I had the honor to tran&s;mit you in mine of the eighth, continued to the four|teenth,&mdash;I was about to &s;end commi&s;&s;ioners to meet tho&s;e ap|pointed by general Howe for adju&s;ting the di&s;puted points be|tween us, carry into execution an exchange of pri&s;oners, and improving the old cartel, as far as it might be practicable, for their better accommodation in future. This meeting was to be on the tenth in&s;tant: but, ye&s;terday morning, Dunlap's paper of the fourth being put into my hands, I found that a re&s;olution had been made the twenty-&s;ixth of February, calling for all ac|counts again&s;t pri&s;oners in our hands, and declaring that no ex|change &s;hould take place, till the balance due thereon to the
<PB N="190" REF="031423_0486_0FEC5EE951639960">
United States is di&s;charged. Some of the &s;tates are not re|quired to exhibit their claims till the fir&s;t of June.&mdash;The time that would be taken to adju&s;t them, and make a delivery of the pri&s;oners, would more than exhau&s;t all the en&s;uing &s;ummer.</P>
<P>This re&s;olution I cannot con&s;ider as an intended infraction of my engagements with general Howe: yet its operation is dia|metrically oppo&s;ite both to the &s;pirit and letter of the propo&s;i|tions made on my part, and acceded to on his. I &s;uppo&s;ed my|&s;elf fully authori&s;ed "by the in&s;tructions and intentions" of Congre&s;s to act as I did: and I now conceive that the public as well as my own per&s;onal honor and faith are pledged for the performance.</P>
<P>By the direction of Congre&s;s, I in the fir&s;t in&s;tance &s;tipulated with general Howe an exchange of pri&s;oners,&mdash;officer for offi|cer, of equal rank,&mdash;&s;oldier for &s;oldier,&mdash;and citizen for citi|zen. This agreement they have ever approved, and repeatedly declared their willingne&s;s to carry into execution.&mdash;Their re&s;o|lution of the twenty-fourth of March la&s;t empowered me (on condition of general Lee being declared exchangeable) not on|ly "<HI>to proceed</HI>" to the exchange of pri&s;oners according to the principles and regulations of the cartel before agreed on, but al&s;o to enter into &s;uch further principles and regulations as &s;hould appear to me mo&s;t proper and advantageous. A &s;ub&s;e|quent re&s;olution of the &s;ixth of June holds forth the &s;ame lan|guage, &s;anctions my conduct and rea&s;onings in the negociations about that time on the &s;ubject, and directs an adherence to them.&mdash;No event has occurred &s;ince that period, by which I could conclude there was any alteration in the views of Con|gre&s;s:&mdash;&s;o far from it, that all my late letters breathing the &s;ame &s;pirit with the former, and pointedly &s;ignifying my wi&s;h to bring about a general exchange,&mdash;if not with an expre&s;s,&mdash;at lea&s;t met with a tacit approbation.&mdash;General Howe at length by profe&s;&s;ion, if not in reality, is willing to perform the agree|ment on the conditions required by me, and confirmed by them.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid, that, with whatever powers I was originally ve&s;ted to negotiate an exchange, the re&s;olution of the nine|teenth of December la&s;t was an abridgment of them, &s;o far as to annex a new condition,&mdash;the &s;ettlement and payment of accounts previous to its taking place.&mdash;I had no conception of this being the ca&s;e in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, however the letter may warrant the con&s;truction. Be&s;ides the common principle of preventing the inconveniencies nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ulting from al|lowing the enemy to make their payments in paper currency, I had rea&s;on to imagine that general Burgoyne's army was
<PB N="191" REF="031423_0487_0FEC5EEB0A208780">
more particularly the object of the concluding clau&s;e. This interpretation I the more readily adopted; for, exclu&s;ive of the affairs of that army, I verily believed, that, from the confu&s;ed defective &s;tate of our accounts relating to pri&s;oners, there would be a con&s;iderable balance in favor of Mr. Howe. Nor was the &s;ituation of our accounts the only rea&s;on for this belief:&mdash;the pri&s;oners in our hands, e&s;pecially tho&s;e we&s;tward of the De|laware, as I am informed, have been in a great mea&s;ure &s;up|ported by their own labor, and at the expen&s;e of the enemy, who have had agents con&s;tantly among us.&mdash;If this is the ca&s;e, the rea&s;on of the re&s;olve not applying, the effect ought not of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>But perhaps it may be thought contrary to our intere&s;t to go into an exchange, as the enemy would derive more immedi|ate advantage from it then we &s;hould.&mdash;This I &s;hall not deny: but it appeared to me, that, on principles of genuine, exten&s;ive policy, independent of the con&s;iderations of compa&s;&s;ion and ju&s;|tice, we were under an obligation not to elude it. I have the be&s;t evidence that an event of this kind is the general wi&s;h of the country:&mdash;I know it to be the wi&s;h of the army; and no one can doubt that it is the ardent wi&s;h of the unhappy &s;uffer|ers them&s;elves. We need only con&s;ult the tide of humanity, and the &s;ympathies natural to tho&s;e connected by the cements of blood, intere&s;t, and a common dread of evil, to be convinced that the prevailing current of &s;entiment demands an exchange. If the country, the army, and even the pri&s;oners them&s;elves, had a preci&s;e idea of our circum&s;tances, and could be fully &s;en|&s;ible of the di&s;advantages that might attend the giving our e|nemy a con&s;iderable reinforcement without having an equiva|lent, they might perhaps be willing to make a &s;acrifice of their feelings to the motives of policy. But they have not this knowledge, and cannot be entru&s;ted with it; and their rea&s;on|ings, of nece&s;&s;ity, will be governed by what they feel.</P>
<P>Were an opinion once to be e&s;tabli&s;hed (and the enemy and their emi&s;&s;aries know very well how to inculcate it, if they are furni&s;hed with a plau&s;ible pretext), that we de&s;ignedly avoided an exchange, it would be a cau&s;e of di&s;&s;atisfaction and di&s;gu&s;t to the country and to the army,&mdash;of re&s;entment and de&s;pera|tion to our captive officers and &s;oldiers:&mdash;to &s;ay nothing of the importance of not hazarding our national character but up|on the mo&s;t &s;olid grounds, e&s;pecially in our embryo &s;tate, from the influence it may have on our affairs abroad,&mdash;it may not be a little dangerous to beget in the minds of our own country|men
<PB N="192" REF="031423_0488_0FEC5EF27199B160">
a &s;u&s;picion that we do not pay the &s;tricte&s;t ob&s;ervance to the maxims of honor and good faith.</P>
<P>It is prudent to u&s;e the greate&s;t caution not to &s;hock the no|tions of general ju&s;tice and humanity, univer&s;al among man|kind as well in a public as a private view. In a bu&s;ine&s;s on the &s;ide of which the pa&s;&s;ions are &s;o much concerned as in the pre&s;ent, men would be readily di&s;po&s;ed to believe the wor&s;t, and cheri&s;h the mo&s;t unfavorable conclu&s;ions. Were the let|ters that, have pa&s;&s;ed between general Howe and my&s;elf from fir&s;t to la&s;t, and the proceedings of Congre&s;s on the &s;ame &s;ub|ject, to be publi&s;hed with proper comments, it is much to be feared,&mdash;if the exchange &s;hould be deferred till the terms of the la&s;t re&s;olve were fulfilled,&mdash;that it would be difficult to prevent our being generally accu&s;ed with a breach of good faith. Perhaps it might be &s;aid, that, while the enemy refu&s;ed us ju&s;tice, we fondly embraced the opportunity to be loud, per|&s;evering, ince&s;&s;ant in our claims; but the moment they were willing to render it, we receded from our&s;elves, and &s;tarted new difficulties.&mdash;This, I &s;ay, might be the rea&s;oning of &s;pecu|lative minds; and they might con&s;ider all our profe&s;&s;ions as <HI>mere</HI> profe&s;&s;ions; or, at be&s;t, that intere&s;t and policy were to be the only arbiters of their validity.</P>
<P>Imputations of this nature would have a tendency to unnerve our operations, by dimini&s;hing that re&s;pect and confidence which are e&s;&s;ential to be placed in tho&s;e who are at the head of af|fairs either in the civil or military line. This, added to the pro&s;pect of hopele&s;s captivity, would be a great di&s;couragement to the &s;ervice. The ill con&s;equences of both would be immen&s;e, by increa&s;ing the cau&s;es of di&s;content in the army, which are already too numerous, and many of which are in a great mea|&s;ure unavoidable,&mdash;by fortifying that unwillingne&s;s which al|ready appears too great, towards entering into the &s;ervice, and of cour&s;e impeding the progre&s;s both of draughting and re|cruiting,&mdash;by dejecting the courage of the &s;oldiery, from an apprehen&s;ion of the horrors of captivity,&mdash;and finally by reduc|ing tho&s;e, who&s;e lot it is to drink the bitter cup, to a de&s;pair which can only find relief by renouncing their attachments and engaging with their captors. The&s;e effects have already been experienced in part from the ob&s;tacles that have lain in the way of exchanges: but if the&s;e ob&s;tacles were once to &s;eem the re&s;ult of &s;y&s;tem, they would become ten-fold.&mdash;Nothing has operated more di&s;agreeably upon the minds of the militia than the fear of captivity, on the footing it has hitherto &s;tood.&mdash;
<PB N="193" REF="031423_0489_0FEC5EF4B01324E8">
What would be their rea&s;onings, if it &s;hould be thought to &s;tand upon a wor&s;e?</P>
<P>If a pre&s;ent temporary intere&s;t is to be a ruling principle, it is ea&s;y to prove that an exchange can never take place. The con&s;titution of our army in re&s;pect to the term of &s;ervice for which our men engage, and the dependence we are obliged to place on the militia, mu&s;t forever operate again&s;t us in ex|changes, and forbid an equality of advantages. Should it be &s;aid that there are times when it might be more peculiarly un|equal and injurious, and that the pre&s;ent is &s;uch on account of the weak condition of our army,&mdash;I an&s;wer that the delay ne|ce&s;&s;arily involved in the previous negociation on the &s;ubject, in delivering the pri&s;oners from time to time in &s;mall numbers and receiving others in their &s;tead, and the mode of delivery at dif|ferent places, will nearly bring the matter to the point we could wi&s;h, and give us lei&s;ure to reinforce this army (if it is to be done at all), &s;o as to obviate in a great mea&s;ure the ill con&s;e|quences apprehended.</P>
<P>But if the argument of intere&s;t on a partial &s;cale be pur&s;ued as far as it will go, not only the general con&s;ideration thrown out above, but &s;pecial ones appo&s;ite to every &s;ituation, will pre|&s;ent them&s;elves, that we ought not to exchange:&mdash;now we ought not, becau&s;e our army is weak!&mdash;when the &s;ea&s;on is more advanced, and it is time for the campaign to open, we ought not, becau&s;e our army may be &s;trong, and it will be our bu&s;ine&s;s to avail our&s;elves of our own &s;trength and the enemy's weakne&s;s, to &s;trike &s;ome deci&s;ive blow!&mdash;if they, by the pro|tection of their &s;hipping and impregnable works, &s;hould be able to baffle our attempts till the period of reinforcements from Europe arrive, it will &s;urely then not be our intere&s;t to add numbers and &s;trength to an enemy already &s;ufficiently nume|rous and &s;trong!&mdash;Thus, by a parity of rea&s;oning, the golden aera will never come, which is to relieve the mi&s;eries of capti|vity. Our &s;ervice mu&s;t become odious: tho&s;e who are out of it will endeavor to keep &s;o; and tho&s;e who are in it will wi&s;h to get out of it: every pri&s;oner the enemy makes will be his &s;oldier rather than &s;ubmit to a rigorous and de&s;pairing confine|ment.</P>
<P>If we do not &s;eize the pre&s;ent propitious moment when the nece&s;&s;ities of the enemy pre&s;s them to rea&s;onable terms, to form and e&s;tabli&s;h a liberal cartel, it is not impo&s;&s;ible, in the vici&s;&s;i|tudes and rever&s;es of war, that a time may come when we &s;hould wi&s;h we had embraced it, and intere&s;t may &s;trongly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> enemy to decline it, except on the mo&s;t unequal condi|tions.
<PB N="194" REF="031423_0490_0FEC5EF94828CE60">
True policy, as well as good faith, in my opinion, binds us to improve the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>There are however &s;ome ambiguities in general Howe's con|duct, which require explanation, and ought to put us upon our guard.&mdash;I determined to make the affair of citizens,&mdash;<ABBR>viz.</ABBR> to procure an exemption from captivity for them, if po&s;&s;ible,&mdash;or, if not, (&s;ince it cannot now be demanded as a matter of right) to fix their exchangeability upon the ea&s;ie&s;t and mo&s;t unequivo|cal foundation.&mdash;an indi&s;pen&s;able preliminary to any further procedure; and at the &s;ame time to &s;ecure the exchange of ge|neral Lee and all other officers who have been the particular objects of exception.</P>
<P>The interview intended between general Howe's commi&s;&s;ion|ers and tho&s;e on our part on the tenth in&s;tant is now po&s;tponed. I cannot doubt that Congre&s;s, in pre&s;ervation of the public faith and my per&s;onal honor, will remove all impediments that now oppo&s;e them&s;elves to my engagements, and that they will authori&s;e me, through commi&s;&s;ioners appointed for the purpo&s;e, to negociate a more exten&s;ive and competent cartel, upon &s;uch principles as may appear advantageous and founded in nece&s;&s;ity,&mdash;any re&s;olutions heretofore to the contrary notwith&s;tanding; and I mu&s;t reque&s;t that they will favor me with their an&s;wer by the earlie&s;t opportunity.</P>
<P>The work, from its nature, will be difficult. Two parties are concerned, who&s;e intere&s;ts are more than oppo&s;ite in a com|mon view.&mdash;We &s;hall endeavor to act for the be&s;t, and to pro|mote the public &s;ervice as far as po&s;&s;ible, though we may not be able to an&s;wer the expectations of all. But it &s;hould be re|membered, that, although general Howe's want of men affords a pro&s;pect of favorable terms, yet he will not be di&s;po&s;ed to &s;acrifice to it all con&s;iderations of general advantage in a con|tract of &s;uch a nature; and it is not even to be hoped that it can take place except on principles of mutual benefit.</P>
<P>I per&s;uade my&s;elf that the freedom I have taken in deliver|ing my &s;entiments &s;o fully upon this occa&s;ion will readily be excu&s;ed, as it proceeds from a de&s;ire to place the motives of my conduct in a ju&s;t point of view, and from an opinion of du|ty that led me to a free di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of a &s;ubject, which con&s;i|dered in all its lights, will appear to comprehend con&s;equences of the fir&s;t delicacy and magnitude.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been this day favored with yours of the twen|ty-&s;eventh of February, and of the &s;econd, third, and fourth in&s;tant, which I &s;hall an&s;wer in their order.</P>
<P>The removal of &s;o valuable a train of field artillery from Albany to Farmington, as to a place of greater &s;ecurity, was certainly a mea&s;ure highly proper; and you may be a&s;&s;ured that every precaution &s;hall be taken to e&s;cort them &s;afely through Jer&s;ey to this camp, when it is thought advi&s;able to bring them hither.</P>
<P>You mi&s;took the intent of mine of the eighteenth of Febru|ary. I did not mean to give you the trouble of making a re|turn of the Briti&s;h officers who were exchanged after the con|vention. General Reide&s;el, as I informed you wrote to me to obtain liberty for him to make an exchange of &s;ome of his &s;uite and other foreign officers, as that liberty had been allow|ed to the Briti&s;h. I did not chu&s;e to give him any an&s;wer un|til I had applied to you, that I might know whether you had any rea&s;on for making &s;uch di&s;tinction: and as you mi&s;appre|hended me, I &s;hall &s;till be obliged to defer an&s;wering him till I hear from you.&mdash;I think, con&s;idering the great number of of|ficers of ours who are in captivity, it is our intere&s;t to exchange as many of their officers, pri&s;oners under the convention, as we can.</P>
<P>Commi&s;&s;ioners from me are to meet others from general Howe on the thirty-fir&s;t of this month, to endeavor to &s;ettle a general exchange of pri&s;oners.&mdash;Until we know the i&s;&s;ue of the negociation, it will be hardly worth while to alter the &s;ituation of the pri&s;oners in Lanca&s;ter county.</P>
<P>On the twenty-&s;eventh of February I had occa&s;ion to write to Congre&s;s, on the &s;ubject of yours of the third. It was oc|ca&s;ioned by a repre&s;entation from the colonel of the thirteenth Virginia regiment which was rai&s;ed (as colonel M'Kay's and Cooke's were) to remain upon the frontier. Were this the ca&s;e with only one regiment, I &s;hould not he&s;itate, con&s;idering the face of affairs to the we&s;tward, to order it immediately to Fort-Pitt or the neighborhood. But the eighth and twelfth Penn&s;ylvania, and the twelfth and thirteenth Virginia, all claim the &s;ame right; and if the indulgence is granted to one, the others will be di&s;&s;atisfied: and to &s;pare them all at this time is impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>To regain the de&s;erters from tho&s;e regiments is certainly a very de&s;irable thing; and the mode you point out is the mo&s;t
<PB N="196" REF="031423_0492_0FEC5F01A224B518">
probable. But I fear, if tho&s;e men who are now here find that the de&s;erters are not to be brought down to join their regiments in camp, that they may be induced to go off, in hopes of ob|taining the &s;ame terms. I confe&s;s I am much embarra&s;&s;ed by this matter, and &s;hall be exceedingly glad to have the advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Congre&s;s and the board upon the &s;ubject, be|fore I come to any determination. It is an evil that will ever re&s;ult from enli&s;tments for local purpo&s;es, when it is not conve|nient to abide by the agreement.</P>
<P>I &s;hall immediately tran&s;mit the papers, inclo&s;ed in yours of the fourth, to general Howe.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON &s;unday night I had the honor to receive your favors of the fir&s;t and fifth in&s;tant, with their inclo&s;ures.</P>
<P>I am happy to find that my pa&s;t conduct re&s;pecting citizens, in the corre&s;pondence between general Howe and my&s;elf, is ap|proved by Congre&s;s. They may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured that their rights are &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed on my mind; and that, in all my tran&s;|actions, every &s;upport in my power &s;hall be given them. I know their importance; and, in my expected negociations with general Howe, if po&s;&s;ible, I will exempt citizens from captivi|ty. However I cannot hope to effect it, as I cannot demand it as a matter of right, &s;ince Congre&s;s them&s;elves, in their ori|ginal re&s;olve directing a propo&s;ition to be made for the exchange of pri&s;oners, mentioned that of citizens,&mdash;which implied a right of capturing them.</P>
<P>They may be a&s;&s;ured that general Lee will not be forgotten. He has all along been a principal object in di&s;pute: and, &s;o far from doing any thing injurious to him, his right to be exchang|ed, and his relea&s;ement, are intended to be placed upon the mo&s;t explicit, unambiguous footing.&mdash;Indeed, from the &s;pirit of general Howe's letters collectively taken, &s;ince his agreement to enlarge the officers on parole in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and his ex|ten&s;ion
<PB N="197" REF="031423_0493_0FEC5DB39482AFC8">
of it in the exchange,&mdash;though they are not free from ambiguities,&mdash;it may be inferred, that, on &s;ending in lieutenant-colonel Campbell and the He&s;&s;ian field-officers captured at Trenton, an exchange of all officers will immediately commence. It &s;eems to be a point with him that it &s;hall begin with them, as they have been longe&s;t in captivity.&mdash;I have taken the li|berty to inclo&s;e you copies of three letters which have ju&s;t pa&s;|&s;ed between general Howe and my&s;elf, more particularly con|cerning general Lee, in which I have pu&s;hed matters re&s;pecting him as far as I thought it prudent at this time.&mdash;Every pre|caution will certainly be u&s;ed to prevent the enemy gaining a|ny advantage in the exchange of pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>With great deference, I would take the liberty to ob&s;erve that Congre&s;s &s;eemed to have carried the preamble of their re|&s;olve of the twenty-&s;ixth ultimo, prohibiting the enli&s;ting, &amp;c. pri&s;oners and de&s;erters, too far; and, through accident, to have recited a fact that has never happened (at lea&s;t to my know|ledge), and which is injurious to us,&mdash;<ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that pri&s;oners had been enli&s;ted by us. If any have, it is what I never knew. However, be this as it may, if the re&s;olution has not been pub|li&s;hed, I could wi&s;h the preamble to be altered, and only to re|cite, "<HI>that experience,</HI> &amp;c. in <HI>de&s;erters</HI>" only. The re&s;olution it&s;elf may &s;tand as it does, comprehending a prohibition again&s;t the enli&s;tment of both.</P>
<P>My rea&s;on for troubling Congre&s;s upon this occa&s;ion is,&mdash;we have always complained again&s;t general Howe, and &s;till do, for obliging and permitting the pri&s;oners in his hands to enli&s;t, as an unwarrantable procedure, and wholly repugnant to the &s;pirit at lea&s;t of the cartel. This preamble &s;eems to admit the practice on our part, which would certainly ju&s;tify it in him, and is &s;uch evidence as mu&s;t &s;ilence us in future (&s;hould it &s;tand), and afford him an opportunity for recrimination,&mdash;though, as I have &s;ugge&s;ted, I believe no pri&s;oners have ever been enli&s;ted by us,&mdash;I am &s;ure, none have through compul|&s;ion.</P>
<P>I have the plea&s;ure to tran&s;mit you an extract of a letter from captain Barry, which will inform you of his &s;ucce&s;&s;es. The two &s;hips he burned after &s;tripping them; and he was o|bliged, it &s;eems, two days after the capture, to ground and a|bandon the &s;chooner, after a long and &s;evere engagement with &s;ome of the enemy's frigates and &s;maller armed ve&s;&s;els.&mdash;It is &s;aid he &s;aved her guns and mo&s;t of her tackle.</P>
<P>I al&s;o take the liberty to lay before Congre&s;s copies of let|ters from me&s;&s;ieurs Champion, Wad&s;worth, and Reed. From

the uniformity of &s;entiment held forth by the&s;e gentlemen, it is much to be feared the mea&s;ures lately adopted by the commi&s;|&s;ioners at New-haven, for regulating the prices of provi&s;ion, will have a di&s;agreeable effect upon our &s;upplies of meat.&mdash;How far it may be practicable to &s;u&s;pend their operation for a time, I cannot determine: but, if it can be done, it appears we &s;hould experience many advantages from it. It is a matter of great importance; and as &s;uch, is &s;ubmitted to Congre&s;s for their con&s;ideration.&mdash;If any thing can be done to procure &s;up|plies of provi&s;ion, particularly of the &s;alt kind, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, and am per&s;uaded, it will not be omitted.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS will be pre&s;ented to you by count Pula&s;ki, who, from a conviction that his remaining at the head of the cavalry was a con&s;tant &s;ubject of unea&s;ine&s;s to the principal officers of that corps, has been induced to re&s;ign his command. Waving a minute inquiry into the cau&s;es of di&s;&s;atisfaction,&mdash;which may be reduced perhaps to the di&s;advantages under which he labor|ed, as a &s;tranger not well acquainted with the language, genius and manners of this country,&mdash;it may be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve that the degree of harmony which is in&s;eparable from the well-being and con&s;equent utility of a corps, has not &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in the cavalry &s;ince his appointment, and that the mo&s;t effectual as well as the ea&s;ie&s;t remedy is that which he has generou&s;ly applied.</P>
<P>The count however, far from being di&s;gu&s;ted with the &s;er|vice, is led by his thir&s;t of glory, and zeal for the cau&s;e of li|berty, to &s;olicit farther employment, and waits upon the Con|gre&s;s to make his propo&s;als. They are briefly that he be al|lowed to rai&s;e an independent corps compo&s;ed of &s;ixty-eight hor&s;e and two hundred foot,&mdash;the hor&s;e to be armed with lan|ces, and the foot equipped in the manner of light infantry. The former he thinks he can readily fill with natives of good character and worthy the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them. With re&s;pect to the other, he is de&s;irous of more latitude, &s;o as to have li|berty of engaging pri&s;oners and de&s;erters from the enemy.</P>
<P>The original plan for the lance-men was to have draughted them from the regiments of hor&s;e. But, as this method would produce a cla&s;hing of intere&s;ts and perhaps occa&s;ion new di&s;tur|bances, the count prefers having a corps totally unconnected
<PB N="199" REF="031423_0495_0FEC5F51F763EA98">
with any other. My advice to him, therefore, is to enli&s;t his number of cavalry with the continental bounty; and, if it &s;hould be found con&s;onant to the views of Congre&s;s to allow his rai&s;ing the number propo&s;ed over and above the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment for the hor&s;e, then he would have them on the footing of an independent corps: if not, he might at all events have them as draughts; and in this ca&s;e there would be no ground for complaint.</P>
<P>With regard to the infantry, which the count e&s;teems e&s;&s;en|tial to the &s;ucce&s;s of the cavalry, I have informed him that the enli&s;ting de&s;erters and pri&s;oners is prohibited by a late re&s;olve of Congre&s;s.&mdash;How far Congre&s;s might be inclined to make an exception, and licen&s;e the engaging pri&s;oners in a particular detached corps, in which &s;uch characters may be admitted with le&s;s danger than promi&s;cuou&s;ly in the line,&mdash;I cannot undertake to pronounce.</P>
<P>I have only to add that the count's valor and active zeal on all occa&s;ions have done him great honor; and, from a per&s;ua|&s;ion, that, by being le&s;s expo&s;ed to the inconveniences which he has hitherto experienced, he will render great &s;ervices with &s;uch a command as he a&s;ks for, I wi&s;h him to &s;ucceed in his application.</P>

<P>P. S. It is to be under&s;tood that the count expects to retain his rank as brigadier, and, I think, is entitled to it from his ge|neral character and particular di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the honor to tran&s;mit you a letter from gover|nor Clinton which he inclo&s;ed to me for my peru&s;al and con&s;i|deration.&mdash;The inconvenience he mentions, as re&s;ulting from the re&s;olve re&s;pecting the appointment of a commandant for Forts Montgomery and Clinton, requires to be obviated. I do not conceive it to have been the de&s;ign of Congre&s;s to make the command of tho&s;e forts altogether di&s;tinct and independent on the general command of the po&s;ts in that quarter; but only to de&s;ignate the rank of the officer who &s;hould have the im|mediate charge of them.</P>
<P>There is &s;uch an intimate connexion between the forts and the other po&s;ts and pa&s;&s;es in the Highlands and their vicinity, that it is nece&s;&s;ary for one officer to have the &s;uperintendency
<PB N="103" REF="031423_0496_0FEC5F541961E8D8">
and control of the whole, and to be an&s;werable for all. If this were not to be the ca&s;e, but the command were not to be di|vided, there might want that co-operation between the garri|&s;ons and the troops without, which might be e&s;&s;ential to their pre&s;ervation and to the common purpo&s;es of defence. The a&s;|&s;igning a fixed number of men to the garri&s;ons would not re|move this inconvenience; for the co-operation would &s;till be nece&s;&s;ary. But if it were otherwi&s;e, I &s;hould not think the mea&s;ure advi&s;able, becau&s;e we do not know what number of men we may have in the field next campaign; and the num|ber for the defence of the Highlands mu&s;t be proportioned to the general &s;trength; and the force of the garri&s;ons, to that number.</P>
<P>On the&s;e con&s;iderations, having ordered general M'Dougal to repair to the Highlands to a&s;&s;ume the chief command there, I have comprehended the forts among the other objects of his tru&s;t; in the di&s;charge of which, I am per&s;uaded he will mani|fe&s;t adequate zeal and ability. But as the re&s;olve in que&s;|tion affords room for doubt, it will be proper to have it ex|plained, &s;o as more explicitly to a&s;certain the intention of Con|gre&s;s.</P>
<P>I am perfectly in &s;entiment with governor Clinton on the propriety of drawing the troops from the northward to reinforce and carry on the works in the Highlands. From every thing I can learn, there &s;eems to be no pro&s;pect of pro&s;ecuting the intended expedition into Canada. If &s;o, I apprehend it can an&s;wer no valuable end to keep a body of troops in and about Albany.&mdash;In the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of Canada, little is to be dreaded thence: the enemy, in all probability, will be well &s;atisfied to act on the defen&s;ive, without ri&s;king the con&s;equen|ces of an attempt again&s;t us. A proper garri&s;on at Fort-Schuyler, and a &s;mall party by way of guard at Albany, with the militia of the country that may be occa&s;ionally drawn to|gether, will be a &s;ufficient &s;ecurity again&s;t the inroads from the enemy from Canada, or the depredations of the neighbouring Indians, &s;uppo&s;ing there were any of the tribes who&s;e di&s;po&s;i|tions were &s;till actively ho&s;tile notwith&s;tanding our late northern &s;ucce&s;&s;es,&mdash;which is by no means a natural &s;uppo&s;ition.&mdash;All the men, more than are wanted for the&s;e purpo&s;es, would be of the mo&s;t important utility in the Highlands.</P>
<P>If the arms and &s;tores at Albany &s;hould be thought an ob|jection to the plan, I would beg leave to ob&s;erve that Albany appears to me a mo&s;t improper place for &s;tationary ar&s;enals or magazines, and that tho&s;e which are there at pre&s;ent &s;hould
<PB N="201" REF="031423_0497_0FEC5F5814B29198">
be removed without delay. Be&s;ides, as they would be in mo&s;t danger from an incur&s;ion up the North-river, the be&s;t way to counteract that danger is to &s;trengthen the pa&s;&s;es in the High|lands, and ob&s;truct the navigation; in order to which the rein|forcing them with the troops from the northward would be no incon&s;iderable &s;tep.&mdash;With the greate&s;t re&s;pect, I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</P>

<P>THIS will be delivered to you by captain Sullivan, who waits on Congre&s;s upon the &s;ubject of pay and the lo&s;s of his rank in the line of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts officers.&mdash;He is one of the gentlemen, who, in going with major Sherburne to relieve the po&s;t we had at the cedars in 1776, after a brave and gallant conduct, fell into the enemy's hands. In a few days after, on the treaty which general Arnold made, he generou&s;ly offered him&s;elf, as I have been informed, and went one of the ho&s;tages to Quebec, for the performance of it.</P>
<P>By &s;ome means the &s;tate of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay has not conti|nued him in their line, nor has he any appointment in the ar|my. He is now on parole, through the indulgence of general Carleton, and has applied to me for pay and rations from the time of his return: and con&s;idering al&s;o the deprivation of his rank as hard and injurious, he hopes he will be provided for in a &s;uitable manner, and according to that &s;tanding which he for|merly held in the army.</P>
<P>Captain Sullivan's wi&s;hes, in either in&s;tance, cannot be an|&s;wered by me.&mdash;As to the fir&s;t, the re&s;olution of the nineteenth of January, regulating the pay of pri&s;oners (which is the only rule for my government) &s;eems to have drawn the line between officers on parole who are continued in &s;ervice, and tho&s;e who are not; and, making that the only criterion to fix pay, to have precluded every other di&s;crimination: and the powers, which were ve&s;ted in the re&s;pective &s;tates to appoint officers, prohibit any interference by me in his favor, as to the latter.</P>
<P>I have &s;tated the nature of the captain's claims, and the rea|&s;ons which are oppo&s;ed to his obtaining relief in either in&s;tance from me. I &s;hall only add that the neglect by the &s;tates (in their appointments) of the officers who were in captivity, where there was no other objection to them, was at lea&s;t ungenerous, if not impolitic and unju&s;t. It has been the ca&s;e in many in|&s;tances: and as to the gentlemen who is particularly the &s;ubject
<PB N="202" REF="031423_0498_0FEC5F5A67C580D8">
of this letter, the te&s;timonials that have been given of his cha|racter as an officer were much in his favor, and greatly to his honor.</P>
<P>By accident, the re&s;olution of the nineteenth of January, al|luded to above, has been mi&s;laid. I mu&s;t trouble you with a reque&s;t for another copy of it.</P>
<P>I tran&s;mit Congre&s;s colonel * * *'s application to re&s;ign. As general Huntington, in who&s;e brigade he is, and in whom I have the utmo&s;t confidence, is perfectly willing, I have only to &s;ay upon the occa&s;ion that I have not the &s;malle&s;t objection to the mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>General Sullivan &s;et out for Rhode-I&s;land on friday la&s;t, to take the command there in con&s;equence of the re&s;olution of Congre&s;s directing me to &s;end a major-general there for that purpo&s;e.

<P>ON &s;aturday I had the honor to receive your favor of the tenth, with the re&s;olutions alluded to.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed I take the liberty to tran&s;mit an extract of a letter ju&s;t received from general Par&s;ons.&mdash;This, as well as the letter which I inclo&s;ed you ye&s;terday from governor Clinton, will &s;hew the confu&s;ion in the management of affairs on the North-river. I informed Congre&s;s then that I had &s;ent general M'|Dongal to take the chief command there, comprehending the forts,&mdash;which appeared to me the only effectual means for cur|ing all di&s;orders, and promoting the public &s;ervice.&mdash;To remove all impediments, it were to be wi&s;hed that Congre&s;s would in|ve&s;t him with every nece&s;&s;ary power for carrying into execu|tion the objects of his command: and it might be well if they were to extend to any future commanding officer, as it would prevent tho&s;e difficulties which have heretofore ari&s;en from their having been con&s;idered as merely per&s;onal.</P>
<P>I am more and more in &s;entiment with governor Clinton on the propriety and ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of drawing the troops from the northward, to reinforce and carry on the works in the High|lands. From the information I have from colonel Radiere who has ju&s;t come from thence, I find that the intended defences are far le&s;s advanced than I had any idea of. According to him, little or nothing is yet done, though I have repeatedly and con|&s;tantly
<PB N="203" REF="031423_0499_0FEC5F651DDBAD40">
urged the pro&s;ecution of them with all po&s;&s;ible indu&s;try. The inclo&s;ed copies of my letters to general Putnam will &s;hew that I have uniformly pre&s;&s;ed the clo&s;e&s;t attention to the bu&s;i|ne&s;s,&mdash;though it might be inferred from general Par&s;ons's let|ter that there had been &s;ome incon&s;i&s;tency in my orders. There remains but a little time to do a great deal in; and I fear that no exertions now will be &s;ufficient to place things in that quar|ter on the &s;ecure and re&s;pectable footing we could wi&s;h. How|ever, we &s;hould do the mo&s;t we can: and if the works can not be as complete as they ought, the troops will be there; and a reliance mu&s;t be had in their bravery, to repel any attempt that may be formed again&s;t them.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HEREWITH I do my&s;elf the honor to inclo&s;e copies of a letter from an officer of militia in Elizabethtown, to me, and an extract of a letter from one of Mr. Boudinot's deputies at Bo&s;ton, to him,&mdash;both tending to induce a belief that the ene|my have &s;ome enterpri&s;e in contemplation. What this is, time mu&s;t di&s;cover.&mdash;I have this whole winter been clearly of opi|nion that general Howe's movements would be very early this &s;pring, to take advantage of the weak &s;tate of our army,&mdash;or late, if he expected con&s;iderable reinforcements from England, and meant to avail him&s;elf of his full &s;trength. If the fir&s;t takes place, as appearances indicate, it may, I think, be con&s;idered as a proof of one or both of the&s;e two things,&mdash;that he is either well informed (he cannot indeed be otherwi&s;e) of the &s;ituation, and more than probably, of the &s;trength of our army,&mdash;or that he expects no con&s;iderable reinforcements this year from Europe. In either ca&s;e it is our indi&s;pen&s;able duty to re|inforce and arrange our army as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible, that we may in the fir&s;t in&s;tance be prepared for defence,&mdash;in the &s;econd, take advantage of any favorable circum&s;tance which may hap|pen, to injure the enemy.</P>
<P>Whatever may be the de&s;igns of Congre&s;s with re&s;pect to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the army, I know not: but I do mo&s;t earne&s;tly and devoutly recommend a &s;peedy adoption of them, and the appointment of officers, as our pre&s;ent &s;ituation at this advanced &s;ea&s;on is truly alarming, and to me highly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, as I am convinced that we &s;hall be plunged into the campaign before our arrangements are made, and the army properly organized.</P>
<P>The numberle&s;s di&s;advantages re&s;ulting from the late appoint|ment of general officers la&s;t year, make me look forward with infinite anxiety, this:&mdash;for, after all the wi&s;dom that Congre&s;s or their committee can u&s;e in the choice of officers, many will be di&s;gu&s;ted: re&s;ignations of &s;ome and perhaps non-acceptance of others will follow. Before matters then can be brought to a proper tone, much time will be lo&s;t, and a great deal of trou|ble and vexation encountered,&mdash;to overcome which, is not the work of a day: and, till they are overcome, confu&s;ion, di&s;order, and lo&s;s, mu&s;t prevail. In the mean while, order, regularity,
<PB N="205" REF="031423_0501_0FEC5F6D5B589C40">
and di&s;cipline, which require the vigilance of every officer to e&s;tabli&s;h, and mu&s;t flow from the general officers in every army,&mdash;are neglected, or not entered upon in time, to effect. Thus it happened la&s;t year, and brigades and divi&s;ions became vacant, to the great injury of the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>As it is not improper for Congre&s;s to have &s;ome idea of the pre&s;ent temper of the army, it may not ne ami&s;s to remark in this place, that, &s;ince the month of Augu&s;t la&s;t, between two and three hundred officers have re&s;igned their commi&s;&s;ions, and many others were with difficulty di&s;&s;uaded from it. In the Vir|ginia line only, not le&s;s than &s;ix colonels, as good as any in the &s;ervice, have left it lately; and more, I am told, are in the hu|mor to do &s;o.</P>
<P>Highly advantageous al&s;o would it be, if the recruits and draughts from North-Carolina and Virginia were not &s;uffered to halt on their way to camp under pretence of getting equip|ped, but &s;ent forward and incorporated into the different regi|ments of their re&s;pective &s;tates as &s;oon as it could be done. Out of the number of men &s;aid to be draughted in Virginia la&s;t fall, and others from North-Carolina, very few have joined the ar|my; but, owing to de&s;ertion and other cau&s;es, they have dwin|dled to nothing: and this will always be the ca&s;e with new re|cruits, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who are unwillingly drawn forth, if much time is &s;pent in getting them to their regiments under the care of proper officers. This &s;hews the nece&s;&s;ity (if the &s;ea&s;on and other powerful rea&s;ons did not loudly call for it) of ha&s;tening them to the army.</P>
<P>My &s;olicitude for the pre&s;ervation of the communication of the North-river gives me very unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations on account of our po&s;ts there, and will excu&s;e my again a&s;king if the troops to the northward, except &s;uch as are nece&s;&s;ary for the defence of Fort-Schuyler, can be &s;o advantageou&s;ly employed as at the works on that river.&mdash;A re&s;pectable force at tho&s;e po&s;ts would awe New-York, and divide general Howe's force or expo&s;e the city.&mdash;To depend too much upon militia, is, in my opinion, putting every thing to hazard.</P>
<P>If I &s;hould appear uncommonly anxious re&s;pecting the &s;eve|ral matters contained in this letter, by repeating them,&mdash;Con|gre&s;s will do me the ju&s;tice, I hope, to believe that I am actu|ated by no views but &s;uch as are prompted by circum&s;tances and the advanced &s;ea&s;on.&mdash;With the greate&s;t re&s;pect, I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</P>

<P>I have this day received a letter from general Smallwood, dated ye&s;terday at Wilmington, in which he &s;ays&mdash;"The ene|my, about four days ago, had a fleet of near fifty &s;ail &s;tanding up the river, which I fancy was from New-York; and ye&s;ter|day their foraging fleet went up without touching upon this &s;ide the Delaware, except three or four &s;mall parties about Port-Penn, who have been con&s;tantly drove off by a party of about a hundred of our men, who have been guarding and aid|ing the removal of the forage, which is at length happily ef|fected."</P>
<P>A Philadelphia paper of the twenty-&s;eventh al&s;o mentions, that a fleet of upwards of forty &s;ail had left the Hook on &s;un|day, and that they were &s;aid to be in the river.</P>

<P>General St. Clair arrived ye&s;terday from Bo&s;ton: and, as he &s;eems very anxious to have his matter determined one way or the other, I beg leave to recal the attention of Congre&s;s to my letter of the twenty-&s;eventh of February upon that &s;ubject.&mdash;Having received no information &s;ince that time which &s;erves to direct my judgment as to the charges which it will be proper to exhibit again&s;t general St. Clair, I have only again to re|que&s;t that Congre&s;s or the committee will be plea&s;ed to point out the particular charges upon which the court &s;hall proceed.</P>
<P>I could wi&s;h this matter might not be delayed; on &s;everal ac|counts. General St. Clair is in a very delicate &s;ituation, and feels it &s;en&s;ibly.

I had it in contemplation at the time, in ca&s;e no other me|thod more eligible could be adopted, to make him an offer of a place in my family.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE now the honor to acknowledge your &s;everal letters of the twenty-fir&s;t, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth ultimo, with their inclo&s;ures, which have been duly received.&mdash;It gives me pain to ob&s;erve they appear to contain &s;everal implications by which my &s;en&s;ibility is not a little wounded.&mdash;I find my&s;elf extremely embarra&s;&s;ed by the &s;teps I had taken towards an ex|change of pri&s;oners and the formation of a general cartel mak|ing more ample provi&s;ion for their future accommodation and relief. The views of Congre&s;s &s;eem to be very different from what I &s;uppo&s;ed them when I entered into my late engagements with general Howe: their re&s;olution of the thirtieth ultimo, pointedly requiring a &s;trict adherence to all former ones upon the &s;ubject, will in all probability render them impracticable.&mdash;I con&s;idered &s;ome of their re&s;olutions as dictated on the princi|ple of retaliation, and did not imagine the terms they contain|ed would be in&s;i&s;ted upon in negociating an agreement calcu|lated to remedy the evil which occa&s;ioned them. In mo&s;t re|&s;pects they might be &s;ub&s;tantially complied with: but there are &s;ome points to which an exact conformity mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity de&s;troy the idea of a cartel. One is the obliging the enemy to pay gold and &s;ilver on equal terms for continental curren|cy,
<PB N="209" REF="031423_0505_0FEC5F33760FB0F0">
e&s;timating the articles &s;upplied them at their actual prices with us, as &s;eems to be the de&s;ign of the re&s;olve of the nine|teenth of December.&mdash;Another is the &s;ubjecting the inhabitants of the&s;e &s;tates, taken in arms again&s;t them, to trial and puni&s;h|ment, agreeable to the re&s;olve of the thirtieth of the &s;ame month.</P>
<P>I am well aware that appearances ought to be upheld, and that we &s;hould avoid as much as po&s;&s;ible recogni&s;ing by any public act the depreciation of our currency; but I conceive this end would be an&s;wered as far as might be nece&s;&s;ary, by &s;tipulating that all money payments &s;hould be made in gold and &s;ilver, being the common medium of commerce among na|tions, at the rate of four &s;hillings and &s;ixpence for a Spani&s;h milled dollars, &amp;c.&mdash;by fixing the price of rations on an equi|table &s;cale relatively to our re&s;pective circum&s;tances,&mdash;and providing for the payment of what we may owe, by &s;ending in provi&s;ion, and &s;elling it at their market. The rates of money, and the prices of provi&s;ions and other commodities, differ every where: and, in treaties of a &s;imilar nature between any two &s;tates, it is requi&s;ite, for mutual convenience, to a&s;certain &s;ome common ratio both for the value of money in payments, and for the rates of tho&s;e articles on which they may ari&s;e.</P>
<P>It was determined on mature con&s;ideration not to conclude any thing expre&s;sly that &s;hould contradict the re&s;olution of the thirtieth December: but at the &s;ame time, if it is de&s;igned to be the rule of practice, it is ea&s;y to perceive it would at once overturn any cartel that could be formed. General Howe would never con&s;ent to ob&s;erve it on his part, if &s;uch a practice were to exi&s;t on ours.&mdash;Though the law ought not to be con|travened by an expre&s;s article admitting the exchangeability of &s;uch per&s;ons, yet, if it is not &s;uffered to &s;leep, it is in vain to expect the operation of it will be acquie&s;ced in by the enemy.</P>
<P>The mea&s;ures I have taken mu&s;t evince that it is my deter|mination to pay the fulle&s;t attention to the intere&s;ts of citizens, and to the rights of general Lee, in the treaty: and I think it but ju&s;tice to the gentlemen appointed to negotiate it, to de|clare that I know them to be &s;o fully impre&s;&s;ed with the im|portance of both tho&s;e objects, as to make them cheerfully ob|&s;ervant of the injunctions of Congre&s;s, &s;o far as not to conclude any agreement of which the exchange of general Lee and the alternative re&s;pecting citizens are not e&s;&s;ential parts.&mdash;The&s;e points had been early determined on.</P>
<P>It is with no &s;mall concern that I have been obliged to trou|ble Congre&s;s upon the &s;ubjects of this letter: and, &s;hould they
<PB N="210" REF="031423_0506_0FEC5F78D0E7E180">
appear to them in the &s;ame light they do to me, and they &s;hould think proper to remove the ob&s;tacles which now oppo&s;e the bu&s;ine&s;s in hand, I mu&s;t reque&s;t they will be plea&s;ed to communicate their determination as expeditiou&s;ly as po&s;&s;ible, that the commi&s;&s;ioners may govern them&s;elves accordingly and either proceed to forming a cartel, or put an end to the nego|tiation.&mdash;Before the re&s;olves of the thirteenth came to hand, they had met, and been in treaty two days, with a pro&s;pect of a favorable accommodation.</P>
<P>I am happy to inform Congre&s;s that general Lee will be out on parole to-morrow in place of general Pre&s;cot: and I have every rea&s;on to expect, if the negotiation can be continued up|on admi&s;&s;ible terms, that his exchange will immediately follow the relea&s;ement of colonel Campbell and the He&s;&s;ian field-offi|cers. It is agreed that lieutenant-colonel Allen &s;hall be ex|changed for lieutenant-colonel Campbell.</P>
<P>The importunate applications of colonel Lee and major Swazey to leave the &s;ervice oblige me to lay the matter before Congre&s;s. Colonel Lee's letter upon the &s;ubject was tran&s;mit|ted me the twenty-fifth of January: but, hoping he might change his mind, I deferred writing to Congre&s;s upon his re|que&s;t. He has renewed it again in urgent terms, through general Heath, and I have only to ob&s;erve that it is a painful circum|&s;tance to &s;ee officers of their merit leaving the &s;ervice.&mdash;It is the ca&s;e every day.&mdash;I &s;hall be obliged by Congre&s;s informing me of the dates of the re&s;ignations of the colonels in the Virgi|nia line:&mdash;I have only received the date of colonel Lewis's.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed is a letter from captain Cotteneau of the &s;hip Fer|dinand, with an invoice of her cargo. The letter only came to hand ye&s;terday: and, as it is of an old date, it is highly proba|ble that the goods are &s;old. If they are not,&mdash;from the cap|tain's de&s;ire to give the public a preference in the &s;ale, Con|gre&s;s will have an opportunity of directing them to be purcha&s;|ed. Mo&s;t of them would be proper for the army.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE had the honor of receiving your favor of the fourth in&s;tant, inclo&s;ing a re&s;olve of Congre&s;s, of the &s;ame date, empowering me to call forth five thou&s;and militia from the &s;tates of Maryland, Penn&s;ylvania, and New-Jer&s;ey. I thank Congre&s;s for the power: at the &s;ame time it is incumbent on me to a&s;&s;ure them, that,&mdash;granting the practicability of collect|ing &s;uch a number,&mdash;it would prove a work of time, difficulty, and expen&s;e; to evince which, I need only recur to the expe|rience of la&s;t campaign on &s;imilar occa&s;ions, and to remind you that it was not po&s;&s;ible to obtain a thou&s;and men, nor &s;ome|times even one hundred, from this &s;tate, although the former number was required and promi&s;ed, for the purpo&s;e of cover|ing during the winter the country between Schuylkill and De|laware.</P>
<P>As this re&s;olve appears to have been made in con&s;equence of my letters of the twenty-fourth and twenty-ninth ultimo, which were founded on conjecture, and, in &s;ome degree, mi&s;informa|tion,&mdash;and as the execution of it would, exclu&s;ive of the incon|veniences abovementioned, I am per&s;uaded have a tendency to injure the completion of the continental regiments,&mdash;I &s;hall call for a &s;mall part only of the number allowed; but could wi&s;h that Hartley's regiment were ordered immediately to camp, and the duties of it performed by militia. In like manner I would propo&s;e that all remote guards &s;hould be compo&s;ed of militia, and that the &s;everal purpo&s;es for which men are drawn from the continental troops &s;hould be an&s;wered by them. This would be a means of drawing together a con&s;iderable number of men who are in a manner lo&s;t to the army, and of employing the militia to the be&s;t advantage po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The great end of my letter to Congre&s;s of the twenty-fourth ultimo, &s;eems to have been mi&s;taken. My views were not turned to reinforcements of militia. To know whether the old e&s;tabli&s;hment of the army, or the new as agreed upon by the committee, is the choice of Congre&s;s,&mdash;and in what manner the
<PB N="212" REF="031423_0508_0FEC601776B0BB80">
regiments of this &s;tate and the additionals are to be reduced,&mdash;officers for the whole appointed, &amp;c. were my objects. The&s;e are objects of the greate&s;t moment, as they may, in their con|&s;equences, involve the fate of America; for I will undertake to &s;ay, that it is next to impo&s;&s;ible, when the &s;ea&s;on is &s;o far ad|vanced, properly to accompli&s;h tho&s;e changes, appointments, and the dependent arrangements for the en&s;uing campaign. Should any convul&s;ion happen, or movement take place, they will be altogether impracticable.&mdash;Ju&s;tice to my own character, as well as duty to the public, con&s;train me to repeat the&s;e things: their con&s;equences are more ea&s;ily conceived than de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid by &s;ome, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ir, that my wi&s;h to &s;ee the officers of this army upon a more re&s;pectable e&s;tabli&s;hment, is the cau&s;e of my &s;olicitude, and carries me too far.&mdash;To &s;uch I can declare that my anxiety proceeds from the cau&s;es abovementioned. If my opinion is a&s;ked with re&s;pect to the nece&s;&s;ity of making this provi&s;ion for the officers, I am ready to declare that I do mo&s;t religiou&s;ly believe the &s;alvation of the cau&s;e depends upon it,&mdash;and, without it, your officers will moulder to nothing, or be compo&s;ed of low and illiterate men, void of capacity for this or any other bu&s;ine&s;s. To prove this, I can with truth aver, that &s;carce a day pa&s;&s;es, without the offer of one or two commi&s;&s;ions; and my advices from the ea&s;tward and &s;outhward are that num|bers who had gone home on furlough mean not to return, but are e&s;tabli&s;hing them&s;elves in more lucrative employments.&mdash;Let congre&s;s determine what will be the con&s;equence of this &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Per&s;onally, as an officer, I have no intere&s;t in their deci&s;ion, becau&s;e I have declared, and I now repeat it, that I never will receive the &s;malle&s;t benefit from the half-pay e&s;tabli&s;hment: but, as a man who fights under the weight of a pro&s;cription, and as a citizen who wi&s;hes to &s;ee the liberty of his country e&s;tabli&s;hed upon a permanent foundation, and who&s;e property depends up|on the &s;ucce&s;s of our arms, I am deeply intere&s;ted. But,&mdash;all this apart, and ju&s;tice out of the que&s;tion,&mdash;upon the &s;ingle ground of economy and public &s;aving, I will maintain the utili|ty of it: for I have not the lea&s;t doubt, that, until officers con|&s;ider their commi&s;&s;ions in an honorable and intere&s;ted point of view, and are afraid to endanger them by negligence and inat|tention, no order, regularity, or care either of the men or pub|lic property, will prevail. * * *</P>
<P>By officers who are ju&s;t returned from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, I learn that there is not the lea&s;t pro&s;pect of getting men from thence before the month of June,&mdash;if then; and indeed that
<PB N="213" REF="031423_0509_0FEC5FAA0FD25E88">
there is no rea&s;on to expect any number that will de&s;erve the name of reinforcement for the continental regiments this cam|paign,&mdash;the towns being only called upon to furni&s;h the defi|ciency of their la&s;t year's quota, &s;o that all &s;ub&s;equent ca&s;ualties are di&s;regarded, and the fifteen regiments from that &s;tate, which may now perhaps want four thou&s;and men to complete them, will receive only five hundred if the towns came within that number of their complement la&s;t year.&mdash;What change the re|qui&s;ition of Congre&s;s, of the [<HI>twenty-&s;ixth</HI>] of February, may ef|fect, I &s;hall not undertake to &s;ay:&mdash;if it has not a &s;peedy and powerful operation, our pro&s;pects in that quarter will be ex|ceedingly unpromi&s;ing.</P>
<P>A gentleman from New-Hamp&s;hire &s;ome little time &s;ince in|formed me that matters were nearly in the &s;ame train there, notwith&s;tanding a re&s;olve for the completion of their batallions; and the inclo&s;ed copy of a letter (No. 1) from general Putnam, whom I have de&s;ired to remain in Connecticut for &s;ome time in order to forward the recruits from that &s;tate, conveys his ideas of what may be expected from thence. What New-York, New-Jer&s;ey, and North-Carolina have done or are about to do, I know not.&mdash;Penn&s;ylvania and Maryland have tried the effect of voluntary enli&s;tments to little purpo&s;e; and the fir&s;t, in di|rect contradiction to the mo&s;t pointed injunctions laid on the officers, have their recruits compo&s;ed chiefly of de&s;erters, who will embrace the fir&s;t opportunity of e&s;caping with our arms.&mdash;Virginia, it is true, has proceeded to a draught: but the num|ber, be&s;ides being in it&s;elf inadequate, has been le&s;&s;ened by de|&s;ertion; and the deficiency of the regiments, on the other hand, being increa&s;ed by death and de&s;ertion, their &s;trength will pro|bably fall very far &s;hort of the new e&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>This, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ir, is not a flattering picture of our affairs: but the re|pre&s;entation is ju&s;t; and it is incumbent on me to exhibit it in my own defence, as, notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e unfavorable cir|cum&s;tances,&mdash;and what is to me a certain pro&s;pect of being plunged into the campaign before the arrangements are made, officers appointed, &amp;c.&mdash;great matters, I perceive, are expect|ed from our activity this &s;pring:&mdash;in proportion therefore will the di&s;appointment be felt by tho&s;e who are the mo&s;t &s;anguine. For want of the ratification of Congre&s;s, the hor&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hment, companies of &s;appers, provo&s;t-mar&s;hal&s;ey, &amp;c. &amp;c. (as agreed to by the committee, and recommended to their con&s;ideration) are entirely at a &s;tand, at a time when we ought to be deriving be|nefits from their execution.&mdash;In a word, at no period &s;ince the commencement of the war have I felt more painful &s;en&s;ations on
<PB N="214" REF="031423_0510_0FEC5F0463417788">
account of delay, than at the pre&s;ent, and, urged by them, I have expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf without re&s;erve.</P>
<P>By a letter ju&s;t received from general Weedon, I am inform|ed of his intention to re&s;ign, if general Woodford &s;hould be re|&s;tored to his former rank, which he had not then heard. General Muhlenberg is now balancing on the &s;ame point. One, there|fore, if not two brigadiers, will be wanted for that &s;tate.&mdash;The di&s;advantages re&s;ulting from the frequent re&s;ignations in the Virginia line, the changes of commanding officers to the re|giments, and other cau&s;es equally di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, have injured that corps beyond conception, and have been the means of reducing very re&s;pectable regiments in &s;ome in&s;tances to a mere handful of men; and this will ever be the ca&s;e till officers can be fixed by &s;omething equivalent to the &s;acrifice they make. To rea&s;on otherwi&s;e, and &s;uppo&s;e that public virtue alone will enable men to forego the ca&s;e and comforts of life, to encounter the hard|&s;hips and dangers of war for a bare &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, when their com|panions and friends are ama&s;&s;ing large fortunes,&mdash;is viewing hu|man nature rather as it &s;hould be, than as it really is.</P>
<P>The clothier-general of the army, as well as the heads of e|very other department, &s;hould be in camp, near the commander in chief: otherwi&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible that the operations of war can be conducted with energy and preci&s;ion. I wi&s;h mo&s;t &s;in|cerely that this,&mdash;as not the lea&s;t e&s;&s;ential part of the bu&s;ine&s;s &s;ettled with the committee,&mdash;were decided, and a thorough in|ve&s;tigation were had into the conduct of this department; as it is a matter of univer&s;al a&s;toni&s;hment that we &s;hould be deficient in any article of clothing, when it is commonly a&s;&s;erted that the ea&s;tern &s;tates alone can furni&s;h materials enough to clothe a hun|dred thou&s;and men.&mdash;If this be a fact, there is a fatal error &s;ome|where, to which may be attributed the death and de&s;ertion of thou&s;ands.</P>
<P>I &s;hall make no apology for the freedom of this letter.&mdash;To inform Congre&s;s of &s;uch facts as materially affect the &s;ervice, I conceive to be one great and e&s;&s;ential part of my duty to them and my&s;elf. My agreement with the committee entitled me to expect upwards of forty thou&s;and continental troops, exclu&s;ive of artillery and hor&s;e, for the &s;ervice of the en&s;uing campaign, including tho&s;e to be employed in the defence of the North ri|ver.&mdash;In&s;tead of the&s;e, what are my pro&s;pects?</P>

<P>WITH your letter of the &s;eventeenth in&s;tant, and its in|clo&s;ures, I was duly honored on &s;aturday afternoon.&mdash;When I addre&s;&s;ed you on the eighteenth, I was doubtful whether the draught of the bill then tran&s;mitted was not &s;purious and con|trived in Philadelphia: but its authenticity, I am almo&s;t cer|tain, is not to be que&s;tioned. The information from Philadel|phia &s;eems clear and conlu&s;ive that it came over in the packet, with lord North's &s;peech on the introduction of it into parlia|ment. I inclo&s;e a paper containing his &s;peech, which ju&s;t came to hand.&mdash;This bill I am per&s;uaded, will pa&s;s into a law.&mdash;Con|gre&s;s will perceive by the mini&s;ter's &s;peech, that it aims at ob|jects of the greate&s;t extent and importance, and will, no doubt, in one way or other, involve the mo&s;t intere&s;ting con&s;equences to this country.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I TAKE the liberty to tran&s;mit you a letter which I re|ceived ye&s;terday from governor Tryon, inclo&s;ing the draughts of the two bills I forwarded before, with his certificate of the manner in which they came to his hands, accompanied by his
<PB N="217" REF="031423_0513_0FEC601D82908650">
more extraordinary and impertinent reque&s;t, that, through my means, the contents &s;hould be communicated to the officers and men of this army. This engine of mini&s;try, from governor Living&s;ton's account, is very indu&s;triou&s;ly circulating copies of the&s;e draughts, in obedience to their and his royal mandates.&mdash;The letter which I inclo&s;e, and a triplicate, came to hand at one time: &s;ome future conveyance, it is probable, will pre&s;ent me the duplicate.</P>
<P>I would al&s;o take the liberty to inclo&s;e you the Evening Po&s;t, No. 475, which governor Living&s;ton was &s;o obliging as to &s;end me ye&s;terday. Were we not fully &s;atisfied from our experience, that there are no artifices, no mea&s;ures too * * * for the ene|my or their adherents to attempt in order to promote their views, we might be a&s;toni&s;hed at the daring confidence, in defi|ance of the opinion of the world, manife&s;ted in a publication in this paper, purporting to be a re&s;olution of congre&s;s, of the twentieth of February. This proceeding is infamous to the la&s;t degree, and calculated to produce the mo&s;t baneful con&s;e|quences by exciting an oppo&s;ition in the people to our draught|ing &s;y&s;tem, and embarra&s;&s;ing at lea&s;t the only probable mode now left us for rai&s;ing men. I think it of great importance that the forgery &s;hould be announced in the mo&s;t public man|ner, and am the more induced to this opinion from governor Living&s;ton's account of the di&s;agreeable operation it has had, and is &s;till likely to produce, if not contradicted. If it is, and with a few &s;trictures, I &s;hould hope that it would excite in the brea&s;ts of all our countrymen, a ju&s;t and generous contempt of the enemy for &s;uch a dirty, wicked proceeding.</P>
<P>I was la&s;t night honored with your favor of the eighteenth in&s;tant, with the proceedings alluded to.&mdash;A general plan of operations for the campaign is indi&s;pen&s;ably e&s;&s;ential to be &s;et|tled. I have thought much upon the &s;ubject: and &s;ome pro|po&s;itions re&s;pecting it were put into the hands of all the gene|ral officers here on tue&s;day evening, for their con&s;ideration. I al&s;o intended to &s;end a me&s;&s;enger this day to meet general Gates, &s;uppo&s;ing him to be on his way to Hud&s;on's-river, and to reque&s;t his call at this camp, that we might enter into a full and free di&s;cu&s;&s;ion on the point.&mdash;Their is not a moment to be delayed in forming &s;ome general &s;y&s;tem, in my opinion; and I only wait the arrival of generals Gates and Mifflin, to &s;ummon a council for the purpo&s;e.</P>

<P>I BEG leave to inform Congre&s;s that the report of the commi&s;&s;ioners coming, according to intelligence received ye&s;|terday by a per&s;on of Philadelphia, is confidently believed; and it is there thought they will very &s;oon arrive. I think it al|mo&s;t certain that the matter will not be delayed, as the con|duct of mini&s;try, in not &s;ending them immediately after their former propo&s;itions, has been much reprobated, and as it may be of much importance to improve the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions of the people upon the occa&s;ion.&mdash;Lord Amher&s;t, admiral Keppel, and general Murray, are &s;aid to be the per&s;ons appointed; and it is likely they are ve&s;ted with both civil and military powers.&mdash;The information was through the channel of a &s;en&s;ible intelli|gent man, well known, and of e&s;teemed credit. He is con|nected with the Briti&s;h army, having two or three brothers in it.&mdash;I &s;hall tran&s;mit the earlie&s;t accounts I may receive from time to time on this very intere&s;ting &s;ubject.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD the honor ye&s;terday afternoon to receive your letter of the twenty-fourth, continued to the twenty-fifth, with its important inclo&s;ures.&mdash;Congre&s;s will be plea&s;ed to accept my &s;incere thanks for the fre&s;h in&s;tance of confidence manife&s;ted in their re&s;olution of the twenty-third, and other proceedings; and they may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured that whatever powers are entru&s;ted to me &s;hall be invariably directed to promote the intere&s;t of the&s;e &s;tates. If in any ca&s;e there &s;hould be a mi&s;application or a failure in the execution, it will be the effect of mi&s;take and not of de&s;ign.</P>
<P>I &s;hall take mea&s;ures for di&s;tributing the report of the com|mittee on Lord North's bills, and the re&s;olution of the twenty-third inviting delinquents to return to their allegiance and to the protection of the&s;e &s;tates. This proceeding appears to me founded in great good policy; and I &s;hould hope that it will
<PB N="219" REF="031423_0515_0FEC5F18E34F90E8">
be attended with many valuable con&s;equences:&mdash;but this can only be proved by the event.</P>
<P>Though I wi&s;h mo&s;t heartily for the aid of general Lee in council and upon every other occa&s;ion,&mdash;yet, as the time of his return is uncertain, or at lea&s;t it will be &s;everal days before it takes place,&mdash;and as it &s;eems to me that there is not a moment to lo&s;e in forming &s;ome general &s;y&s;tem for our operations,&mdash;I &s;hould think it inexpedient for general Gates to delay coming to camp till his arrival. After a plan is dige&s;ted, there will be a great deal of time expended before things will be in a proper train for execution. The &s;ea&s;on is fa&s;t advancing; and the pe|riod which may be mo&s;t favorable for any de&s;igns we may form will pre&s;ently arrive.</P>
<P>I take the liberty to tran&s;mit an extract of a letter from ge|neral Heath, which will &s;hew Congre&s;s that he is pre&s;&s;ed on all &s;ides for money. Governor Living&s;ton too is apprehen&s;ive he will be under embarra&s;&s;ments on account of the purcha&s;e of hor&s;es in con&s;equence of the recommendation of the committee. Their letter to him by &s;ome means has been mi&s;laid in the a&s;|&s;embly, and he does not know exactly the mode pre&s;cribed for the payment. I cannot inform him my&s;elf, or do what perhaps is more nece&s;&s;ary,&mdash;furni&s;h him with money; and therefore hope that Congre&s;s or the committee will.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE exten&s;ive ill con&s;equences, ari&s;ing from a want of uniformity in di&s;cipline and manoeuvres throughout the army, have long occa&s;ioned me to wi&s;h for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a well-organi&s;ed in&s;pector&s;hip: and the concurrence of Congre&s;s in the &s;ame views has induced me to &s;et on foot a temporary in&s;titu|tion, which, from the &s;ucce&s;s that has hitherto attended it, gives me the mo&s;t flattering expectations, and will, I hope, ob|tain their approbation.</P>
<P>Baron De Steuben's length of &s;ervice in the fir&s;t military &s;chool in Europe, and his former rank, pointed him out as a per&s;on peculiarly qualified to be at the head of this department. This appeared the lea&s;t exceptionable way of introducing him into the army, and one that would give him the mo&s;t ready op|portunity of di&s;playing his talents. I therefore propo&s;ed to
<PB N="220" REF="031423_0516_0FEC5FB7D9973948">
him to undertake the office of in&s;pector-general, which he a|greed to with the greate&s;t cheerfulne&s;s, and has performed the duties of it with a zeal and intelligence equal to our wi&s;hes. He has two ranks of in&s;pectors under him: the lowe&s;t are offi|cers charged with the in&s;pection of brigades, with the title of brigade-in&s;pectors: the others &s;uperintended &s;everal of the&s;e: they have written in&s;tructions relative to their &s;everal func|tions; and the manoeuvres which they are to practi&s;e are illu&s;tra|ted by a company which the baron has taken the pains to train him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The brigade-in&s;pectors were cho&s;en by the brigadier and the commanding officers of regiments in each brigade. The in|&s;pectors are lieutenant eolon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ls Barber of Jer&s;ey, Brooks of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, Davis of Virginia, and mon&s;ieur Ternant, a French gentleman:&mdash;the rea&s;on for employing him (apart of his intrin&s;ic merit and abilities) was his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the French and Engli&s;h languages equally, which made him a nece&s;&s;ary a&s;&s;i&s;tant to the Baron de Steuben. He is content to &s;erve without rank, until, after an experiment of his abilities, Congre&s;s &s;hall deter|mine what he is entitled to.</P>
<P>Upon the arrival of lieutenant-colonel Fleury in camp, as he was unemployed, and had exerci&s;ed the office of aid-ma|jor in France, the Baron propo&s;ed to have him employed as an in&s;pector; in which I readily acquie&s;ced, as Congre&s;s had given him the rank and pay of lieutenant-colonel.&mdash;There may be other foreign officers in continental pay, idle for want of being attached to &s;ome corps, of who&s;e &s;ervices we might avail our&s;elves this way, which is the only method of di&s;po&s;ing of them, unle&s;s they could be formed into a di&s;tinct corps.</P>
<P>From the extraordinary fatigue and clo&s;e attention required of the officers employed in the in&s;pector&s;hip, I did not think it ami&s;s to let them entertain hopes that Congre&s;s would allow &s;ome addition to the pay which they derive from their rank; and I take the liberty of recommending the mea&s;ure. I would propo&s;e twenty dollars, per month for the brigade in|&s;pectors, and thirty for the in&s;pectors, in addition to their pay in the line.</P>
<P>I &s;hould do inju&s;tice if I were to be longer &s;ilent with re|gard to the merits of the baron De Steuben. His knowledge of his profe&s;&s;ion, added to the zeal which he has di&s;covered &s;ince he began upon the functions of his office, lead me to con|&s;ider him as an acqui&s;ition to the &s;ervice, and to recommend him to the attention of Congre&s;s. His expectations with re|gard
<PB N="221" REF="031423_0517_0FEC5FB970FD32E0">
to rank extend to that of major-general. His finances, he ingenuou&s;ly co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">re&s;&s;es, will not admit of his &s;erving without the incidental emoluments: and Congre&s;s, I pre&s;ume from his character and their own knowledge of him, will without diffi|culty gratify him in the&s;e particulars.</P>
<P>The baron is &s;en&s;ible that our &s;ituation requires a few varia|tions in the duties of his office from the general practice in Eu|rope, and particularly that they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be more com|prehen&s;ive; in which, as well as in his in&s;tructions, he has &s;kil|fully yielded to circum&s;tances.&mdash;The &s;ucce&s;s which has hither|to attended the plan enables me to reque&s;t with confidence the ratification of Congre&s;s, and is, I think, a pledge of the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of a well-combined general &s;y&s;tem, which in&s;ur|mountable ob&s;tacles have hitherto oppo&s;ed.</P>

<P>My opinion upon the &s;ubject of a future provi&s;ion for the of|ficers hath been &s;o fully, and, I tru&s;t, &s;o nece&s;&s;arily and equita|bly urged, that I &s;hall not add further re&s;pecting it, except my &s;incere wi&s;hes that the e&s;tabli&s;hment was determined on.

<P>IN a late letter from general Schuyler, I received the proceedings of a board of commi&s;&s;ioners for Indian affairs, held at Albany the fifteenth of la&s;t month. It appears by them and &s;ome other accounts I have &s;een, that there is but little pro&s;|pect of &s;ucceeding in the plan for engaging a body of Indians from that quarter to &s;erve with this army. The advantage which the enemy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es over us, in having the means of mak|ing pre&s;ents much more liberally than we can, has made a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion upon their minds, and &s;eems to be more than a counterbalance for any arguments we can offer to conciliate their attachment. They al&s;o appear to be apprehen&s;ive for their own &s;afety, and rather to wi&s;h for aid and protection from us, than willing to leave their habitations and come to our a&s;|&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>The mea&s;ure propo&s;ed was by way of experiment, as one which might po&s;&s;ibly be attended with valuable con&s;equences, and, if it could have been effected without much difficulty, might have been worth a trial. But, as the &s;cheme does not well corre&s;pond with their pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition, and may &s;erve to increa&s;e our embarra&s;&s;ments in keeping them even in tolera|ble
<PB N="223" REF="031423_0519_0FEC5F351580A380">
good humour, I am inclined to think it would be mo&s;t ad|vi&s;able to relinqui&s;h the attempt. They may be told of what has happened in Europe, with proper embelli&s;hments, and that our affairs are now upon &s;uch a footing as to render their aid in the field unnece&s;&s;ary, and that all we require of them is their friend&s;hip and good wi&s;hes. This and promi&s;es of protection may have a powerful and happy effect.</P>
<P>It is of great importance to counteract the temptation held out by the enemy, and to &s;ecure the good will of the Indians, who appear to be at lea&s;t in a &s;tate of he&s;itancy and indeci&s;ion, if nothing wor&s;e.

<P>I HAD the honor to receive in due time your &s;everal favors of the third, &s;ixth, and ninth in&s;tant, with the papers to which they re&s;pectively alluded.&mdash;After much con&s;ideration upon the &s;ubject, I have appointed general M'Into&s;h to com|mand at Fort-Pitt and in the we&s;tern country, for which he will &s;et out as &s;oon as he can accommodate his affairs. I part with this gentleman with much reluctance, as I e&s;teem him an officer of great worth and merit, and as I know his &s;ervices here are and will be materially wanted. His firm di&s;po&s;ition and equal ju&s;tice, his a&s;&s;iduity and good under&s;tanding,&mdash;added to his being a &s;tranger to all parties in that quarter,&mdash;pointed him out as a proper per&s;on; and I tru&s;t, exten&s;ive advantages will be derived, from his command, which I could wi&s;h was more agreeable.&mdash;He will wait on Congre&s;s for their in&s;truc|tions.</P>
<P>As lieutenant-colonel Southerland, major Agnew, and lieu|tenant Poe, have only reque&s;ted to go to Europe on parole, it does not appear to me that I can with propriety apply to gene|ral Howe for their exchange:&mdash;this would imply that they were pri&s;oners of war. Though their exchange is certainly the mo&s;t de&s;irable mode of relea&s;e as it would relieve an equal number of our officers from captivity, yet I &s;hould be happy if a negotiation for the purpo&s;e &s;hould commence on their part. Knowing that it would be our intere&s;t to exchange all the offi|cers of general Buygoyne's army if it could be done, I wrote general Heath not long &s;ince, to take occa&s;ion to mention to them that we &s;hould always be willing to accede to any equal
<PB N="225" REF="031423_0521_0FEC5F294C6E8690">
propo&s;itions for that purpo&s;e, and would carefully convey their applications to &s;ir William Howe or the general who might command the Briti&s;h army.&mdash;I take the liberty to return their letters, pre&s;uming that Congre&s;s may incline to give them &s;ome an&s;wer, either directly, or through general Heath.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to lieutenant-colonel * * *, I do not find that there is any nece&s;&s;ity for granting the prayer of his petition: we have already too many officers; and I do not apprehend the intere&s;t of the &s;tates would be much promoted in his ap|pointment. If he could make up two or three companies, they would be of pri&s;oners and de&s;erters, who would mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly embrace an early opportunity to go off with their arms and clothing. I am di&s;po&s;ed to con&s;ider him as a man of &s;ome ad|dre&s;s and policy, as he is aiming at a confirmation in the line of the army (by obtaining an appointment to a new corps) of the rank which he had as a divi&s;ion quarter-ma&s;ter. Be&s;ides the impolicy of augmenting the number of our officers where it is not really e&s;&s;ential, &s;uch a promotion would give di&s;&s;atis|faction; and I &s;uppo&s;e there are few officers, if any, who for|merly commanded Mr. * * * in the line of the army, that would &s;ubmit to his orders.</P>
<P>The inclo&s;ed copy of a letter from general Dickin&s;on to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> will inform Congre&s;s of the fate of the continental frigates in Delaware,&mdash;a fate (in the &s;ituation they were left) I had long predicted, and which I had taken much pains to avert, by u&s;ing every argument in my power to have them &s;unk. In that ca&s;e, their de&s;truction would have been at lea&s;t a work of time, diffi|culty and expen&s;e, and might have been perhaps prevented.&mdash;About one o'clock on thur&s;day I got notice of an intended move of the enemy by water; and, conjecturing the de&s;tination of it, had a detachment under general Maxwell (who&s;e tour of duty it was) ready to march towards the Delaware by four o'clock: but a heavy rain prevented their moving till next morning.</P>
<P>I have been happy in the exchange, and a vi&s;it from lieute|nant-colonel Allen. His fortitude and firmne&s;s &s;eem to have placed him out of the reach of misfortune. There is an origi|nal &s;omething in him that commands admiration; and his long captivity and &s;ufferings have only &s;erved to increa&s;e if po&s;&s;ible his enthu&s;ia&s;tic zeal.&mdash;He appears very de&s;irous of rendering his &s;ervices to the &s;tates, and of being employed, and at the &s;ame time does not di&s;cover any ambition for high rank.&mdash;Congre&s;s will herewith receive a letter from him; and I doubt

not they will make &s;uch provi&s;ion for him as they may think proper and &s;uitable.</P>
<P>I take plea&s;ure in tran&s;mitting a Philadelphia paper of the ninth, which came to hand ye&s;terday evening, containing a me&s;&s;age from his mo&s;t chri&s;tian maje&s;ty to the court of London in con&s;equence of the treaty between him and the&s;e &s;tates,&mdash;and his Britannic maje&s;ty's addre&s;s to the lords and commons, &amp;c.&mdash;The me&s;&s;age is received in terms of irony and deri&s;ion, more degrading to the pride and dignity of Britain than any thing &s;he has ever experienced &s;ince &s;he has been a nation.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been honored with your two favors of the ele|venth and fifteenth in&s;tant, with the &s;everal papers alluded to, the former by mon&s;ieur Jemat, the latter by expre&s;s ye&s;terday. Colonel John&s;on &s;et out on &s;aturday afternoon to wait on Con|gre&s;s upon the &s;ubject of his appointment, and, I pre&s;ume, will be at York to-day.</P>
<P>I &s;hall announce the re&s;olution of the fifteenth to the army, and would flatter my&s;elf it will quiet in a great mea&s;ure the unea&s;ine&s;s which have been &s;o extremely di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, and pre|vent re&s;ignations, which had proceeded, and were likely to be at &s;uch a height, as to de&s;troy our whole military &s;y&s;tem. It has experienced no incon&s;iderable &s;hock, particularly in the line of &s;ome &s;tates, from the lo&s;s of &s;everal very valuable offi|cers.</P>
<P>The letter and brevet for colonel Allen I will tran&s;mit by the fir&s;t opportunity.&mdash;He left camp eight days ago.</P>
<P>From a variety of concurring circum&s;tances, and the uniform report of per&s;ons who have left Philadelphia within four days pa&s;t, it would appear that the enemy mean to evacuate the ci|ty. It is &s;aid they have already embarked a part of their heavy cannon and baggage,&mdash;that tran&s;ports are fitted and fitting for their hor&s;e, and taking in hay. The accounts further add that there has been a pre&s;s for &s;ome nights in the city, and &s;everal men obtained in this way, and carried aboard &s;hip; al&s;o that there has been an increa&s;ed number of vendues. The&s;e cir|cum&s;tances
<PB N="227" REF="031423_0523_0FEC5FA2718DE9C0">
all indicate an evacuation: but I have not been able to learn the objects of their future operations.&mdash;I wrote to ge|neral Gates ye&s;terday upon the &s;ubject, that he may be prepar|ed in the be&s;t manner the &s;ituation of things will admit, in ca&s;e they &s;hould be de&s;tined for the North-river,&mdash;and de&s;ired him to retain for the pre&s;ent all the ea&s;tern recruits intended for this army.</P>
<P>The quarter-ma&s;ter-general and commi&s;&s;ary of provi&s;ions are directed to u&s;e every po&s;&s;ible exertion for putting the affairs of their departments in a train to facilitate a movement in ca&s;e it &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary. But &s;uch have been the derangements and di&s;orders in them, that we mu&s;t be greatly embarra&s;&s;ed for a con&s;iderable time yet.</P>
<P>A valuable detachment, under the command of the marquis Fayette, marched this morning, which is intended to move be|tween the Delaware and Schuylkill, for re&s;training the enemy's parties, procuring intelligence, and to act as circum&s;tance may require.</P>
<P>I cannot help feeling for the pri&s;oners in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the enemy. If they evacuate Philadelphia, tho&s;e unhappy men will be dragged away with them, and perhaps to a more mi&s;er|able confinement. But, &s;uppo&s;ing that their future treatment &s;hould not be wor&s;e, or even that it &s;hould be more comforta|ble than their pa&s;t,&mdash;the idea of being removed farther from their friends, and farther from relief, mu&s;t di&s;tre&s;s them to the la&s;t degree.</P>

<P>P. S. I would take the liberty to mention that I think the arms and clothing expected from France &s;hould be brought for|ward without a moment's delay after they arrive. The impo|licy of &s;uffering them ever to remain in places acce&s;&s;ible to &s;hip|ping, out of the que&s;tion,&mdash;our di&s;tre&s;s for both is amazingly great: we have many men now without firelocks, and many coming in, in the &s;ame predicament; and half the army are without &s;hirts. Our condition, for want of the latter, and blankets, is quite painful&mdash;of the former, very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing. The doctors attribute in a great degree the lo&s;s of hundreds of lives by the &s;carcity of clothing; and I am certain hundreds have de&s;erted from the &s;ame cau&s;e.</P>

<P>SINCE I had the honor of addre&s;&s;ing you on the twenty-fourth in&s;tant, nothing material has happened. The enemy are &s;till in Philadelphia: but the intelligence from thence is &s;o clear and &s;o &s;trong, that it is certain, or nearly as much &s;o as any event can be that is contingent, that they mean to abandon it. Again&s;t the various mea&s;ures they are pur&s;uing, which point to an evacuation, there is but one &s;ingle circum&s;tance op|po&s;ed that I can learn, which is, that they are working at their redoubts with great indu&s;try. But this fact, though certainly true, cannot be of &s;ufficient weight to rai&s;e a doubt upon the &s;ubject, and mu&s;t be con&s;idered as merely calculated to deceive us, and to ma&s;k their de&s;ign.</P>
<P>We cannot find out, notwith&s;tanding the mo&s;t diligent pains, whether their movement will be by land or &s;ea; nor are the in|habitants of the town &s;atisfied on the point.&mdash;Appearances fa|vor either.&mdash;They have a great many &s;hips, and very large: yet, from a preparation of boats at Prince's-bay on the &s;outh &s;ide of Staten-I&s;land which I am ju&s;t advi&s;ed of, and for &s;ome other rea&s;ons, a land route is not improbable.</P>

<P>I HAD the honor to receive your favor of the twenty-fifth in&s;tant by doctor Scudder, and that of the twenty-ninth, ye&s;terday afternoon, with the inclo&s;ures and packet to which they referred.</P>
<P>I &s;hall inform major Lee of the new arrangement of his corps, and will appoint the officers required.&mdash;Major Beatty is not in camp. The letter addre&s;&s;ed to him &s;hall be &s;ent by the fir&s;t opportunity to Princeton, where I pre&s;ume he will be found. That for captain Smith is already di&s;patched to him.</P>
<P>The enemy are yet in Philadelphia, though the whole chain of information for &s;everal days pa&s;t afforded grounds to believe

I do not know whether any con&s;iderable quantity may be left: but it has been &s;ugge&s;ted; that, from an expectation of the &s;ort, there are &s;ome bringing into light their gold and &s;ilver for the purpo&s;e of buying-up.&mdash;If there &s;hould be clothing &s;uitable for the army, perhaps there might be nothing unju&s;t in the public's taking the preference, and Congre&s;s appointing one or two intelligent active per&s;ons of addre&s;s, acquainted with the city and with tho&s;e who have the goods, with proper powers to purcha&s;e them.</P>
<P>Whatever mea&s;ure may be thought expedient, it will be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to adopt it as early as po&s;&s;ible, as the evacuation will probably take place in a &s;hort time.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I had the honor of addre&s;&s;ing you this forenoon, I received your letter of the &s;eventeenth, with its &s;everal inclo|&s;ures.&mdash;I am happy in the approbation of Congre&s;s re&s;pecting my conduct to doctor Fergu&s;on. I could not find, after the ma|ture&s;t con&s;ideration on the &s;ubject, that his pa&s;&s;age through the country could be in any wi&s;e material, or an&s;wer any other pur|po&s;e than to &s;pread di&s;affection.</P>
<P>I &s;hall take every mea&s;ure in my power to prevent an inter|cour&s;e between the army and the enemy, and al&s;o between the inhabitants and the latter. You may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured that whatever letters come from their lines &s;hall be, as they ever have been, minutely in&s;pected; and whenever they import any thing of an in&s;idious ca&s;t, they &s;hall be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. In this I tru&s;t I &s;hall not offend again&s;t any rule of right, nor the &s;tricte&s;t propriety.</P>
<P>The letter for the commi&s;&s;ioners I &s;hall tran&s;mit by the earlie&s;t opportunity: however, their departure from Philadelphia will prevent their getting it as &s;oon as they otherwi&s;e would have done.&mdash;I cannot &s;ay that I regret the delay: for there is no knowing to what acts of depredation and ruin their di&s;appointed ambition might have led. And permit me to add that I think there was no other criterion for Congre&s;s to go by, than the one

<P>I have appointed general Arnold to command in Philadel|phia, as the &s;tate of his wound will not permit his &s;ervices in a more active line.

<P>THE baron Steuben will have the honor to deliver you this. I do not know particularly the extent of his bu&s;ine&s;s at York; but, from what he has communicated, it is in part to get the duties and powers of his appointment minutely defined and &s;ettled. I inclo&s;e a copy of orders on the fifteenth in&s;tant, which were i&s;&s;ued to quiet the minds of the general officers, and to remove a &s;pirit of jealou&s;y which but too apparently was ri&s;|ing among them. The&s;e contain my ideas of the principal du|ties of the in&s;pector's office, and, I have rea&s;on to think, are ge|nerally agreeable to the army. While I am on this &s;ubject, I mu&s;t do ju&s;tice to the baron's intelligence, zeal, and indefatiga|ble indu&s;try, from which we have experienced very happy ef|fects.</P>
<P>The inclo&s;ed letter I tran&s;mit at the reque&s;t of captain Gibbs; and I wi&s;h to recommend him to the con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s. He has been in the army from the commencement of the war, and in the capacities he mentions. When Congre&s;s were plea&s;|ed to honor me with the appointment of officers for the &s;ixteen additional batallions, I offered to make &s;ome provi&s;ion for him; but this he declined, preferring to remain in my family. The guard he commanded originally con&s;i&s;ted of fifty men: but, &s;ince the arrival of baron Steuben, it has been augmented to a hundred and fifty. He advi&s;ed that there &s;hould be a &s;elect corps

<P>I WAS duly honored with your favor of the twentieth in&s;tant, with the report to which it referred, and tru&s;t my &s;itu|ation will apologi&s;e for my not an&s;wering it before.</P>
<P>I am now here with the main body of the army, and pre&s;&s;ing hard to come up with the enemy. They encamped ye&s;terday at Monmouth court-hou&s;e, having almo&s;t the whole of their front, particularly their left wing, &s;ecured by a mar&s;h and thick wood, and their rear by a difficult defile, from whence they moved very early this morning.&mdash;Our advance, from the rainy weather, and the inten&s;e heat when fair, (though the&s;e may have been equally di&s;advantageous to them) has been greatly delay|ed. Several of our men have fallen &s;ick from the&s;e cau&s;es; and a few unfortunately have fainted, and died in a little time after.</P>
<P>We have a &s;elect and &s;trong detachment more forward, un|der the command of major-general Lee, with orders to attack their rear if po&s;&s;ible. Whether the detachment will be able to come up with it, is a matter of que&s;tion, e&s;pecially before they get into &s;trong grounds. Be&s;ides this, Morgan, with his corps, and &s;ome bodies of militia, are on their flanks.</P>
<P>I cannot determine yet at what place they intend to embark. Some think they will pu&s;h for Sandy-hook, whil&s;t others &s;uppo&s;e they mean to go to Shoal-harbor. The latter opinion &s;eems to be founded in the greater probability, as, from intelligence, &s;e|veral ve&s;&s;els and craft are lying off that place.</P>
<P>We have made a few pri&s;oners; and they have lo&s;t a good many men by de&s;ertion. I cannot a&s;certain their number, as they came in to our advanced parties, and pu&s;hed immediately into the country. I think five or &s;ix hundred is the lea&s;t num|ber that have come in, in the whole. They are chiefly fo|reigners.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I EMBRACE the fir&s;t moment of lei&s;ure to give Con|gre&s;s a more full and particular account of the movements of the army under my command &s;ince its pa&s;&s;ing the Delaware, than the &s;ituation of our affairs would heretofore permit.</P>
<P>I had the honor to advi&s;e them; that, on the appearances of the enemy's intention to march through Jer&s;ey becoming &s;eri|ous, I had detached general Maxwell's brigade in conjunction with the militia of that &s;tate to interrupt and impede their pro|gre&s;s by every ob&s;truction in their power, &s;o as to give time to the army under my command to come up with them, and take advantage of any favorable circum&s;tances that might pre&s;ent them&s;elves. The army having proceeded to Coryel's ferry, and cro&s;&s;ed the Delaware at that place, I immediately detached colonel Morgan with a &s;elect corps of &s;ix hundred men to rein|force general Maxwell, and marched with the main body to|wards Princeton.</P>
<P>The flow advance of the enemy had greatly the air of de&s;ign; and led me, with others, to &s;u&s;pect that general Clinton, de&s;i|rous of a general action, was endeavouring to draw us down into the lower country, in order, by a rapid movement, to gain our right, and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;trong grounds above us.&mdash;This con&s;ideration, and to give the troops time to repo&s;e and refre&s;h them&s;elves from the fatigues they had experienced from rainy and exce&s;&s;ive hot weather, determined me to halt at Hope|well town&s;hip, about five miles from Princeton, where we re|mained till the morning of the twenty fifth.</P>
<P>On the preceding day I made a &s;econd detachment of fifteen hundred cho&s;en troops under brigadier-general Scott, to rein|force tho&s;e already in the vicinity of the enemy, the more ef|fectually to annoy and delay their march. The next day the army moved to King&s;ton; and, having received intelligence that the enemy were pro&s;ecuting their route towards Monmouth
<PB N="240" REF="031423_0536_0FEC604A404DCDF8">
court-hou&s;e, I di&s;patched a thou&s;and &s;elect men under brigadier|general Wayne, and &s;ent the marquis De la Fayette to take the command of the whole advanced corps, including Maxwell's brigade and Morgan's light infantry, with orders to take the fir&s;t fair opportunity of attacking the enemy's rear.</P>
<P>In the evening of the &s;ame day, the whole army marched from King&s;ton, where our baggage was left, with intention to pre|&s;erve a proper di&s;tance for &s;upporting the advanced corps, and arrived at Cranberry early the next morning. The inten&s;e heat of the weather, and a heavy &s;torm unluckily coming on, made it impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;ume our march that day without great inconve|nience and injury to the troops. Our advanced corps, being differently circum&s;tanced, moved from the po&s;ition it had held the night before, and took po&s;t in the evening on the Monmouth road, about five miles from the enemy's rear, in expectation of attacking them next morning on their march.&mdash;The main body having remained at Cranberry, the advanced corps was found to be too remote, and too far upon the right, to be &s;upported in ca&s;e of an attack either upon or from the enemy; which in|duced me to &s;end orders to the marquis to file off by his left towards Engli&s;htown, which he accordingly executed early in the morning of the twenty-&s;eventh.</P>
<P>The enemy, in marching from Allentown, had changed their di&s;po&s;ition, and placed their be&s;t troops in the rear, con&s;i&s;ting of all the grenadiers, light infantry, and cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;eurs of the line.&mdash;This alteration made it nece&s;&s;ary to increa&s;e the number of our advanced-corps; in con&s;equence of which I detached major-ge|neral Lee with two brigades to join the marquis at Engli&s;htown, on whom of cour&s;e the command of the whole devolved, amount|ing to about five thou&s;and men. The main body marched the &s;ame day, and encamped within three miles of that place. Mor|gan's corps was left hovering on the enemy's right flank; and the Jer&s;ey militia, amounting at this time to about &s;even or eight hundred men, under general Dickin&s;on, on their left.</P>
<P>The enemy were now encamped in a &s;trong po&s;ition, with their right extending about a mile and a half beyond the court-hou&s;e in the parting of the roads leading to Shrew&s;bury and Middletown, and their left along the road from Allentown to Monmouth, about three miles on this &s;ide the court-hou&s;e. Their right flank lay on the &s;kirt of a &s;mall wood, while their left was &s;ecured by a very thick one,&mdash;a mora&s;s running towards their rear, and their whole front covered by a wood, and, for a con&s;iderable extent towards the left, with a mora&s;s.&mdash;In this &s;ituation they halted till the morning of the twenty-eighth.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="031423_0537_0FEC5FCE38CEBD68">
Matters being thus &s;ituated,&mdash;and having had the be&s;t inform|ation, that, if the enemy were once arrived at the heights of Middletown, ten or twelve miles from where they were, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to attempt any thing again&s;t them with a pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s,&mdash;I determined to attack their rear the moment they &s;hould get in motion from their pre&s;ent ground. I communi|cated my intention to general Lee, and ordered him to make his di&s;po&s;ition for the attack, and to keep his troops con&s;tantly lying upon their arms, to be in readine&s;s at the &s;horte&s;t notice. This was done with re&s;pect to the troops under my immediate command.</P>
<P>About five in the morning, general Dickin&s;on &s;ent an expre&s;s informing that the front of the enemy had begun their march. I in&s;tantly put the army in motion, and &s;ent orders by one of my aids to general Lee to move on and attack them unle&s;s there &s;hould be very powerful rea&s;ons to the contrary,&mdash;acquainting him at the &s;ame time, that I was marching to &s;upport him, and, for doing it with the greater expedition and convenience, &s;hould make the men di&s;encumber them&s;elves of their packs and blan|kets.</P>
<P>After marching about five miles, to my great &s;urpri&s;e and mortification, I met the whole advanced corps retreating,&mdash;and, as I was told, by general Lee's orders,&mdash;without having made any oppo&s;ition, except one fire, given by a party under the com|mand of colonel Butler, on their being charged by the enemy's cavalry, who were repul&s;ed.&mdash;I proceeded immediately to the rear of the corps, which I found clo&s;ely pre&s;&s;ed by the enemy, and gave directions for forming part of the retreating troops, who, by the brave and &s;pirited conduct of the officers, aided by &s;ome pieces of well-&s;erved artillery, checked the enemy's ad|vance, and gave time to make a di&s;po&s;ition of the left wing and &s;econd line of the army upon an eminence, and in a wood a lit|tle in the rear, covered by a mora&s;s in front. On this were placed &s;ome batteries of cannon by lord Stirling who command|ed the left wing, which played upon the enemy with great ef|fect, and, &s;econded by parties of infantry detached to oppo&s;e them, effectually put a &s;top to their advance.</P>
<P>General Lee being detached with the advanced corps, the command of the right wing, for the occa&s;ion, was given to ge|neral Greene. For the expedition of the march, and to coun|teract any attempt to turn our right, I had ordered him to file off by the new church, two miles from Engli&s;htown, and fall into the Monmouth road, a &s;mall di&s;tance in the rear of the court-hou&s;e, while the re&s;t of the column moved directly on towards
<PB N="242" REF="031423_0538_0FEC5F83D26F5088">
the court-hou&s;e. On intelligence of the retreat, he marched up and took a very advantageous po&s;ition on the right.</P>
<P>The enemy, by this time, finding them&s;elves warmly oppo&s;ed in front, made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n attempt to turn our left flank; but they were bravely repul&s;ed and driven back by detached parties of infant|ry. They al&s;o made a movement to our right with as little &s;uc|ce&s;s, general Greene having advanced a body of troops with ar|tillery to a commanding piece of ground; which not only di&s;ap|pointed their de&s;ign of turning our right, but &s;everely enfiladed tho&s;e in front of the left wing.&mdash;In addition to this, general Wayne advanced with a body of troops, and kept up &s;o &s;evere and well-directed a fire, that the enemy were &s;oon compelled to retire behind the defile where the fir&s;t &s;tand in the beginning of the action had been made.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation the enemy had both their flanks &s;ecured by thick woods and mora&s;&s;es, while their front could only be ap|proached thro' a narrow pa&s;s. I re&s;olved neverthele&s;s to attack them; and, for that purpo&s;e, ordered general Poor, with his own and the Carolina brigade, to move round upon their right, and general Woodford upon their left, and the artillery to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> them in front. But the impediments in their way prevented their getting within reach before it was dark. They remained upon the ground they had been directed to occupy during the night, with intention to begin the attack early the next morn|ing; and the army continued lying upon their arms in the field of action, to be in readine&s;s to &s;upport them.</P>
<P>In the mean time the enemy were employed in removing their wounded, and about twelve o'clock at night marched away in &s;uch &s;ilence, that, though general Poor lay extremely near them, they effected their retreat without his knowledge. They carried off all their wounded, except four officers and about forty privates who&s;e wounds were too dangerous to permit their removal.</P>
<P>The extreme heat of the weather, the fatigue of the men from their march through a deep &s;andy country almo&s;t entirely de&s;ti|tute of water, and the di&s;tance the enemy had gained by march|ing in the night, made a pur&s;uit impracticable and fruitle&s;s: it would have an&s;wered no valuable purpo&s;e, and would have been fatal to numbers of our men, &s;everal of whom died the preced|ing day with heat.</P>
<P>Were I to conclude my account of this day's tran&s;actions without expre&s;&s;ing my obligations to the officers of the army in general, I &s;hould do inju&s;tice to their merit, and violence to my own feelings. They &s;eemed to vie with each other in manife&s;t|ing

<P>The behaviour of the troops in general, after they recovered from the fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;e occa&s;ioned by the retreat of the advanced corps, was &s;uch as could not be &s;urpa&s;&s;ed.&mdash;All the artillery, both officers and men, that were engaged, di&s;tingui&s;hed them|&s;elves in a remarkable manner.</P>
<P>Inclo&s;ed, Congre&s;s will be plea&s;ed to receive a return of our killed, wounded, and mi&s;&s;ing. Among the fir&s;t were lieu|tenant colonel Bunner of Penn&s;ylvania, and major Dickin&s;on of Virginia, both officers of di&s;tingui&s;hed merit, and much to be regretted.&mdash;The enemy's &s;lain, left on the field, and buried by us, according to the return of the per&s;ons a&s;&s;igned to that duty, were four officers and two hundred and forty-five privates. In the former number was the honorable colonel Monckton. Ex|clu&s;ive of the&s;e, they buried &s;ome them&s;elves, as there were &s;e|veral new graves near the field of battle.&mdash;How many men they may have had wounded, cannot be determined: but, from the u&s;ual proportion, the number mu&s;t have been con&s;iderable.&mdash;There were a few pri&s;on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rs taken.</P>
<P>The peculiar &s;ituation of general Lee at this time requires that I &s;hould &s;ay nothing of his conduct. He is now in arre&s;t. The charges again&s;t him, with &s;uch &s;entence as the court-mar|tial may decree in his ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, &s;hall be tran&s;mitted for the ap|probation or di&s;approbation of Congre&s;s, as &s;oon as it &s;hall be pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Being fully convinced by the gentlemen of this country that the enemy cannot be hurt or injured in their embarkation at Sandy-Hook, the place to which they are going,&mdash;and unwil|ling to get too far removed from the North-river,&mdash;I put the troops in motion early this morning, and &s;hall proceed that way, leaving the Jer&s;ey brigade, Morgan's corps, and other light parties (the militia being all di&s;mi&s;&s;ed), to hover about them, to countenance de&s;ertion, and to prevent their depreda|tions as far as po&s;&s;ible.&mdash;After they embark, the former will take po&s;t in the neighborhood of Elizabethtown, the latter re|join the corps from which they were detached.</P>

<P>I HAD the honor ye&s;terday evening of receiving your very important favor of the tenth in&s;tant.&mdash;Colonel Laurens, one of my aids, will &s;et out this morning with a letter to the French admiral, the count D'E&s;taing, inclo&s;ing a copy of yours and &s;uch other information as I have been able to collect.

<P>It appears by intelligence of to-day that the count D'E&s;|taing is off or near Sandy-Hook, having already &s;eized &s;everal fi&s;hing boats on the banks, in order to procure information and pilots.</P>
<P>The army is in motion, and will cro&s;s the North-river with all convenient di&s;patch, where I &s;hall pur&s;ue &s;uch mea&s;ures as may appear be&s;t calculated for improving the pre&s;ent conjunc|ture.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I had the honor of addre&s;&s;ing you on the four|teenth I have been favored with your letters of the eleventh
<PB N="246" REF="031423_0542_0FEC60602A09CF70">
and &s;eventeenth, with their re&s;pective inclo&s;ures. The next morning after the receipt of the former which came to hand on the &s;eventeenth, I di&s;patched lieutenant colonel Hamilton, ano|ther of my aids, with the be&s;t pilots and the mo&s;t &s;kilful ma|&s;ters of &s;hips I could procure, to admiral count D'E&s;taing, to conver&s;e with him more fully on the &s;ubject of his opera|tions, than I was able to direct lieutenant-colonel Laurens to do for want of the information which I afterwards obtained from major Chouin, and a knowledge in &s;everal other points be&s;ides.</P>
<P>On &s;unday night Mr. Laurens returned; and I found by him that it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the count's fir&s;t wi&s;h to enter at Sandy-Hook, in order to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of, or to de&s;troy if po&s;&s;ible, the whole of the Briti&s;h fleet lying in the bay of New-York; and that, for this purpo&s;e, he had been much engaged in his inqui|ries about the depth of water, and in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ounding the channel to a&s;certain it; the re&s;ult of which was, that the water, from the experiments made, was too &s;hallow at the entrance to admit his large &s;hips,&mdash;or, if they could be got in, it appeared that it would not be without a great deal of difficulty and ri&s;k. Af|ter this di&s;appointment, the next important object which &s;eem|ed to pre&s;ent it&s;elf was an attempt again&s;t Rhode-I&s;land, which the count inclined to make (unle&s;s I &s;hould advi&s;e the contra|ry) as &s;oon as the Chim&egrave;re frigate, which had carried his excellency mon&s;ieur Girard into the Delaware, &s;hould rejoin him.</P>
<P>Lieutenant-colonel Hamilton, who was well informed of our &s;ituation and of my &s;entiments on every point, was in&s;tructed to give the admiral a full and accurate &s;tate of facts, and to acquaint him what aid, and how far we could co-operate with him in ca&s;e of an attempt either again&s;t New-York or Rhode-I&s;land; and al&s;o to obtain his ideas of the plan and &s;y&s;tem which he might think ought to be pur&s;ued, and to agree with him on certain &s;ignals.</P>
<P>Previous to my di&s;patching Mr. Hamilton, from the in|formation I received on my enquiries re&s;pecting the navigation at the Hook, I was led to &s;u&s;pect (however intere&s;ting and de&s;irable the de&s;truction or capture of the Briti&s;h fleet might be) that it was not &s;ufficient to introduce the count's &s;hips. Under this apprehen&s;ion, I wrote general Sullivan on the &s;e|venteenth by expre&s;s, that an expedition might take place in a &s;hort time again&s;t Rhode-I&s;land, and urged him at the &s;ame, time to apply to the &s;tates of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, Rhode-I&s;land and Connecticut, for as many men as would augment his force
<PB N="247" REF="031423_0543_0FEC5FD12B1A0308">
to five thou&s;and, and al&s;o to make every po&s;&s;ible preparation of boa&s;t; provi&s;ion, pilots, &amp;c. as if the event was fixed and certain.</P>
<P>From this time till about twelve o'clock on &s;unday, the troops continued pa&s;&s;ing the river, when I cro&s;&s;ed with the la&s;t divi&s;ion. On monday afternoon I arrived at this place, in the neighborhood of which, the right and left wing encamped that night, with the &s;econd line a few miles in their rear. And here I am happy to add that their pa&s;&s;age acro&s;s the river was effected without any accident, or without any more delay than nece&s;&s;arily attended the work.</P>
<P>Being per&s;uaded now from the conver&s;ation which I have had with &s;everal pilots and ma&s;ters of ve&s;&s;els, of character, as well as from the accounts of other gentlemen, and colonel Laurens's report on his return, that the pa&s;&s;ing of the count's &s;hips by the Hook would be extremely precarious, if not im|practicable,&mdash;I determined ye&s;terday (which was as &s;oon as it could be done), without waiting for further intelligence upon the &s;ubject, to put two brigades under marching orders. They accordingly marched this morning at two o'clock, for Rhode-I&s;land, under the particular command of generals Varnum and Glover re&s;pectively, and both under the direction, for the pre|&s;ent, of the marquis De la Fayette. A water conveyance was thought of, and wi&s;hed for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;e of the troops: but, on con|&s;ideration of all circum&s;tances, &s;uch as the difficulty of provid|ing ve&s;&s;els, the change and precarlou&s;ne&s;s of the winds, the ri&s;k from the enemy's &s;hips, &amp;c. their route by land was deemed by far the more eligible.&mdash;The force with general Sullivan, from the be&s;t and late&s;t advice I have been able to obtain, is about three thou&s;and.&mdash;A detachment under colonel Jack&s;on will follow Varnum's and Glover's brigades.</P>
<P>The inclo&s;ed papers, No. 1, re&s;pecting eight per&s;ons &s;ent from Bennington, and ordered into the enemy's lines, came to hand ye&s;terday. About the &s;ame time I received a letter from governor Clinton, containing a petition by the pri&s;oners, and a letter from the committee of Albany, all remon&s;trating again&s;t the proceeding. As this is a matter in which I have no autho|rity to act, nor in which I would wi&s;h to intermeddle, I take the liberty of referring it to Congre&s;s that they may decide up|on it.&mdash;The pri&s;oners are at We&s;t-Point, and ordered to be de|tained there for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>I would al&s;o take the liberty of tran&s;mitting to Congre&s;s a letter from captain Gibbs, and of recommending him to their con&s;ideration. His letter was to have been &s;ent by the baron
<PB N="248" REF="031423_0544_0FEC6065CC579F48">
Steuben before we marched from Valley-Forge: but his de|clining to go to Yorktown at that time, and our move through the Jer&s;eys, delayed its being done. The captain has been in the army from the commencement of the war, and in the capa|cities which he mentions.&mdash;When Congre&s;s were plea&s;ed to ho|nor me with the appointment of officers for the &s;ixteen addition|al battalions, I offered to make &s;ome provi&s;ion for him: but this he declined, preferring to remain in my family. The guard he originally commanded con&s;i&s;ted of fifty men; but, &s;ince the arrival of baron Steuben, it has been augmented to a hundred and fifty. The baron advi&s;ed that there &s;hould be a &s;elect corps of this number, to receive the manoeuvres in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and to act as a model to the army; and propo&s;ed that it &s;hould be formed of the old guard company, and draughts from the line.&mdash;I pre&s;ume, if it &s;hould be Congre&s;s's plea&s;ure, a majority would be highly acceptable to the captain, and that it is as much as he expects.</P>
<P><HI>Eleven o'clock, P. M.</HI>&mdash;I this moment received a letter from colonel Hamilton, who is on his return to the army, dated the twentieth at Black-point. He informs that the count D'E&s;ta|ing would &s;ail the next evening for Rhode-I&s;land, being con|vinced from actual &s;oundings that he could not enter his &s;hips. He was anxiou&s;ly waiting the arrival of the Chim&egrave;re, but, at all events, meant to &s;ail at the time he mentions. The admiral has agreed on &s;ignals with Mr. Hamilton.&mdash;Immediately after this letter came to hand, my aid, Mr. Laurens, &s;et out for Pro|vidence, having many things to communicate to general Sullivan upon the &s;ubject of his co-operation, which neither time nor propriety would &s;uffer me to commit to paper. General Sulli|van is directed not to confine the number of his troops to five thou&s;and, but to augment it, if he &s;hall judge it nece&s;&s;ary to in|&s;ure his &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>I was informed by Mr. Laurens, that the count D'E&s;taing's magazine of bread is not &s;o large as he could wi&s;h, and that in the cour&s;e of a few weeks he &s;hall be in want. This circum|&s;tance I thought it right to mention: and I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that any quantity of bi&s;cuit may be provided in a little time at Phi|ladelphia.</P>
<P>The inclo&s;ures, No. 2, are copies of three letters from my&s;elf to the admiral.&mdash;I flatter my&s;elf that the pre&s;ent of &s;tock which I directed for him on his fir&s;t arrival, in behalf of the &s;tates, will be approved by Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>The accounts from the we&s;tern frontiers of Tryon county are di&s;tre&s;&s;ing. The &s;pirit of the &s;avages &s;eems to be rou&s;ed, and
<PB N="249" REF="031423_0545_0FEC5FD99E124DA0">
they appear determined on mi&s;chief and havoc in every quar|ter.&mdash;By a letter from governor Clinton, of the twenty-fir&s;t, they have de&s;troyed Springfield and Andreas town, and are marching towards the &s;ettlements on the we&s;t branch of the Delaware. The&s;e incur&s;ions are extremely embarra&s;&s;ing to our other affairs, and I think, will ju&s;tify a conclu&s;ion that &s;ir Hen|ry Clinton's intention was to operate up the North-river.&mdash;Whether it may have changed with circum&s;tances cannot be determined.</P>
<P>I have detached the fourth Penn&s;ylvania regiment and the remains of Morgan's corps, under lieutenant-colonel Butler, and al&s;o colonel Graham with a York &s;tate regiment, to co-operate with the militia, and to check the Indians, if po&s;&s;ible. Colonel Butler is an enterpri&s;ing good officer, and well ac|quainted with the &s;avage mode of warfare: and I am per&s;uaded whatever comes within the compa&s;s of his force and abilities, will be done.</P>

<P>THE baron De Steuben will have the honor of deliver|ing you this. I am extremely &s;orry that this gentleman's &s;itua|tion and views &s;eem to have determined him to quit the &s;ervice, in which he has been heretofore and is capable &s;till of being exten&s;ively u&s;eful. Some di&s;contents, which aro&s;e among the officers on account of the powers with which the office was at fir&s;t ve&s;ted, induced me to arrange the duties of it upon a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> different from that on which it began. The moving &s;tate of the army has for &s;ome time pa&s;t, in a great degree, &s;u&s;pended the exerci&s;e of the in&s;pectorate. When the troops marched from Brun&s;wic, the &s;carcity of general officers,&mdash;mo&s;t of them being engaged with the court-martial either as members or witne&s;&s;es,&mdash;occa&s;ioned my giving the baron a temporary com|mand of a divi&s;ion during the march. On our arrival near our pre&s;ent encampment, I intended he &s;hould relinqui&s;h this charge, and re&s;ume his former office, for which purpo&s;e a ge|neral order was accordingly i&s;&s;ued. But I find that he is en|tirely di&s;inclined to the mea&s;ure, and re&s;olves not to continue in the &s;ervice unle&s;s he can hold an actual command in the line.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tice concurring with inclination con&s;trains me to te&s;tify that the baron has in every in&s;tance di&s;charged the &s;everal
<PB N="250" REF="031423_0546_0FEC603179389EE0">
tru&s;ts repo&s;ed in him with great zeal and ability, &s;o as to give him the fulle&s;t title to my e&s;teem, as a brave, indefatigable, judicious, and experienced officer.&mdash;I regret there &s;hould be a nece&s;&s;ity that his &s;ervices &s;hould be lo&s;t to the army: at the &s;ame time I think it my duty explicitly to ob&s;erve to Congre&s;s, that his de&s;ire of having an actual and permanent command in the line cannot be complied with, without wounding the feel|ings of a number of officers who&s;e rank and merits give them every claim to attention; and that the doing it would be pro|ductive of much di&s;&s;atisfaction and exten&s;ive ill con&s;equences. This does not proceed from any per&s;onal objections on the part of tho&s;e officers again&s;t the baron:&mdash;on the contrary, mo&s;t of them, whom I have heard &s;peak of him, expre&s;s a high &s;en&s;e of his military worth. It proceeds from motives of another na|ture, which are too obvious to need particular explanation, or may be &s;ummed up in this, that they conceive &s;uch a &s;tep would be injurious to their e&s;&s;ential rights and ju&s;t expectations.&mdash;That this would be their way of thinking upon the &s;ubject, I am fully convinced, from the effect which the temporary com|mand given him, even under circum&s;tances &s;o peculiar as tho&s;e I have mentioned, produced:&mdash;the &s;tronge&s;t &s;ymptoms of di&s;|content appeared upon the occa&s;ion.</P>

<P>I DO my&s;elf the honor of tran&s;mitting to Congre&s;s a co|py of a letter from general Knox, and of &s;undry ob&s;ervations and remarks on the ordnance e&s;tabli&s;hment of the eleventh of February, which I received about the time we marched from
<PB N="251" REF="031423_0547_0FEC60332E8F72E8">
Valley-Forge. The&s;e would have been tran&s;mitted before, had it not been for the moving &s;tate of the army, and a variety of other objects which engro&s;&s;ed my attention.&mdash;We have found by experience that &s;ome inconveniences have re&s;ulted from the e&s;tabli&s;hment, which I conceive have proceeded principally from the total independence of the commi&s;&s;ary-general of mili|tary &s;tores on the commanding officer of artillery. It &s;eems &s;ome alterations are nece&s;&s;ary: and what they &s;hall be, Con|gre&s;s will be plea&s;ed to determine.</P>
<P>It is not without reluctance that I am con&s;trained to renew my importunities on the &s;ubject of the committee of arrange|ment. The pre&s;ent un&s;ettled &s;tate of the army is productive of &s;o much di&s;&s;atisfaction and confu&s;ion, and of &s;uch a variety of di&s;putes, that almo&s;t the whole of my time is now employed in finding temporary and inadequate expedients to quiet the minds of the officers, and keep bu&s;ine&s;s on a tolerable &s;ort of footing. Not an hour pa&s;&s;es without new applications and new com|plaints about rank: and, for want of a proper adju&s;tment of this and many other e&s;&s;ential points, our affairs are in a mo&s;t irk&s;ome and injurious train. We can &s;carcely form a court-martial or parade a detachment in any in&s;tance, without a warm di&s;cu&s;&s;ion on the &s;ubject of precedence; and there are &s;everal good officers now who are forced to decline duty, to prevent di&s;putes, and their being commanded by others who upon eve|ry principle are their inferiors, unle&s;s their having obtained commi&s;&s;ions before them (from the opportunities they had of making earlier applications, from local circum&s;tances) &s;hould be con&s;idered &s;ufficient to give them a &s;uperior claim.&mdash;There are many other cau&s;es of di&s;&s;atisfaction on this head: but I will not enter into a minute relation of them. I &s;incerely wi&s;h that the gentlemen appointed, or &s;uch others as Congre&s;s may think proper to nominate for the occa&s;ion, would immediately repair to camp:&mdash;the pre&s;ent opportunity is favorable for reducing matters to &s;y&s;tem and order; and, from painful experience, I know there is an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for it.</P>
<P>I &s;hould al&s;o hope that Congre&s;s will excu&s;e me for mention|ing again the nece&s;&s;ity there is for appointing &s;ome brigadiers. The Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, by the re&s;ignation of general Learned, wants one: Penn&s;ylvania, as general Hand is not here, has but one with the army: Maryland, which has two large brigades in the field, has only general Smallwood; and the North-Caro|lina troops, &s;ince the departure of general M'Into&s;h, have been without any.&mdash;As I had taken the liberty upon a former occa|&s;ion to offer my &s;entiments to Congre&s;s and their committee
<PB N="252" REF="031423_0548_0FEC6037DE5D6830">
upon this &s;ubject, I &s;hould not trouble them now, if I was not more and more convinced that the &s;ervice required promotions in this line. The frequent changes which take place among the officers, where there are no brigadiers, are attended with great inconvenience and detriment; and they are an effectual bar to the introduction of di&s;cipline. In &s;uch ca&s;es, the officers know that their command is but temporary, always liable to cea&s;e; and therefore they do not find them&s;elves &s;ufficiently intere&s;ted to promote order and &s;ubordination; nor will the re&s;t look up to them with that re&s;pect and deference which are e&s;&s;ential. Every day's experience proves this, and &s;hews be|yond que&s;tion that the affairs of a brigade can never be in a right train without a brigadier or &s;ome general officer to direct them.&mdash;It is certain the&s;e appointments, at the fir&s;t view, will add a little to the li&s;t of expen&s;e: but in the end they will be a great &s;aving, and produce many important advantages.&mdash;We are al&s;o a good deal di&s;tre&s;&s;ed at this time for major-generals. However, as this ari&s;es more from the peculiar circum&s;tances and &s;ituation of many which prevent them from duty in the line, than from a deficiency in the number appointed, I &s;hall not add upon the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>There is another branch of the army, which, in my opinion, calls loudly for the appointment of a general officer, and this is the cavalry.&mdash;For want of a proper regulating head in this corps, the whole has been in confu&s;ion, and of but very little &s;ervice; whereas, under a right management, it might be mo&s;t u&s;eful. The principal officers in it do not harmoni&s;e; which circum&s;tance, with their di&s;putes about rank, would (were there no other objections) effectually prevent the corps from rendering the public the &s;ervices they have a right to expect, and of which it &s;hould be capable. To promote any gentleman now in it to a general command, would not be acquie&s;ced in by the re&s;t,&mdash;nor do I know that any of them wi&s;h it;&mdash;and it would increa&s;e their mi&s;under&s;tanding, and, of cour&s;e, di&s;order.</P>
<P>I mean to draw all the hor&s;e immediately together, when I tru&s;t they will be under the direction of a general officer ap|pointed by Congre&s;s for the purpo&s;e. Who he &s;hall be, will remain &s;olely with them to determine. However, I will take the liberty to add that he &s;hould be intelligent, active, atten|tive; and, as far as I can judge, general Cadwallader or gene|ral Reed would fill the po&s;t with great-honor and advantage; though it would &s;eem, from the &s;eat the latter has taken in Congre&s;s, and from his late appointment to the council of Penn|&s;ylvania, as if he had declined every military view. The abi|lities
<PB N="253" REF="031423_0549_0FEC5FDB30DEA690">
of the&s;e gentlemen, as well as their attachment, are ge|nerally known; and I am led to believe that either would be as acceptable to the corps as any per&s;on that can be found. In|deed I have learned as much from two of the colonels.</P>
<P>I have been waiting with the mo&s;t impatient anxiety to hear of count D'E&s;taing's arrival at Rhode-I&s;land; but as yet I have not been &s;o happy. My la&s;t intelligence from thence is a let|ter from general Sullivan, dated at ten o'clock in the forenoon of the twenty-&s;eventh, when he had no advice of the fleet.&mdash;He was in high &s;pirits; and, from the preparation in which matters were, he entertained the mo&s;t flattering hopes of &s;uc|ce&s;s in the intended enterpri&s;e.&mdash;The brigades of Varnum and Glover, with Jack&s;on's detachment, would arrive, I expect, on the &s;econd in&s;tant.</P>
<P>As the army was encamped, and there was no great pro&s;pect of a &s;udden removal, I judged it advi&s;able to &s;end general Greene to the ea&s;tward on wedne&s;day la&s;t, being fully per&s;uad|ed his &s;ervices, as well in the quarter-ma&s;ter line as in the field, would be of material importance in the expedition again&s;t the enemy in that quarter. He is intimately acquainted with the whole of that country, and be&s;ides he has an exten&s;ive intere&s;t and influence in it. And, in ju&s;tice to general Greene, I take occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve that the public is much indebted to him for his judicious manage<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ent and active exertions in his pre&s;ent department. When he entered upon it, he found it in a mo&s;t confu&s;ed, di&s;tracted, and de&s;titute &s;tate. This, by his conduct and indu&s;try, has undergone a very happy change, and &s;uch as enabled us with great facility to make a &s;udden move with the whole army and baggage from Valley-Forge in pur&s;uit of the enemy, and to perform a march to this place. In a word, he has given the mo&s;t general &s;atisfaction, and his affairs carry much the face of method and &s;y&s;tem.&mdash;I al&s;o con&s;ider it as an act of ju&s;tice to &s;peak of the conduct of colonel Wad&s;worth, commi&s;&s;ary-general. He has been indefatigable in his exer|tions, to provide for the army; and, &s;ince his appointment, our &s;upplies of provi&s;ion have been good and ample.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 4.&mdash;At &s;even o'clock in the evening ye&s;terday, I re|ceived the inclo&s;ed letter from general Sullivan, with one ad|dre&s;&s;ed to my&s;elf, a copy of which I do my&s;elf the plea&s;ure of forwarding.&mdash;I am exceedingly happy in the count's arrival, and that things wear &s;o plea&s;ing an a&s;pect.</P>
<P>There is another &s;ubject on which I mu&s;t take the liberty of addre&s;&s;ing Congre&s;s, which is that of the clothier's department. I am perfectly &s;atisfied, that, unle&s;s this very important and
<PB N="254" REF="031423_0550_0FEC606986CE9978">
intere&s;ting office is put under better regulations, the army will never be clothed. * * * I believe both officers and men, particularly the latter, have &s;uffered greater inconveniences and di&s;tre&s;&s;es than &s;oldiers ever did before, for want of clothing; and that this has not flowed more from a real &s;carcity of arti|cles, than a want of proper exertions and provident manage|ment to procure them.&mdash;It is e&s;&s;ential that &s;omething &s;hould be done, and immediately, to place the department on a better footing. We have now a great many men entirely de&s;titute of &s;hirts and breeches, and I &s;uppo&s;e not le&s;s than a fourth or fifth of the whole here who are without &s;hoes. From the deficien|cies in this line, numbers of de&s;ertions have proceeded,&mdash;not to mention deaths; and, what is &s;till wor&s;e, the troops which re|main, and &s;ee them&s;elves in rags, want that &s;pirit and pride ne|ce&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute the &s;oldier.</P>
<P>I have been informed by &s;everal officers, and by &s;uch as I can depend on, that many of the late draughts are willing and de&s;irous of enli&s;ting during the war. I do not conceive my&s;elf at liberty to give direction on the point, and therefore &s;ubmit it to Congre&s;s to decide. However, if they can be engaged for the u&s;ual bounties allowed by the continent, after proper pre|cautions are taken to prevent fraud, I think the mea&s;ure will be expedient.&mdash;It is true, our affairs have an agreeable a&s;pect at pre&s;ent: but the war may continue, and we&mdash;want men. A third of the time of &s;ome of them, and a half in the ca&s;e of others, is already expired; and, as they will ri&s;e in their views, and become more difficult in proportion as their &s;ervice draws to a conclu&s;ion,&mdash;if the &s;tep is con&s;idered advi&s;able, the &s;ooner we attempt to enli&s;t, the better in all probability will the work &s;ucceed.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MR. Fuhrer and Mr. Klein&s;mit
 have lately left the Bri|ti&s;h lines, and come in to us.&mdash;The account they give of them|&s;elves is this, that they had been fir&s;t lieutenants in the He&s;&s;ian corps, were taken pri&s;oners at Trenton, re&s;ided during their captivity at Dumfries in Virginia, were lately exchanged, and have &s;ince re&s;igned their commi&s;&s;ions:&mdash;that having &s;olicited per|mi&s;&s;ion to come out from the enemy, and refu&s;ed, they deter|mined to leave them at all hazards, and have now put their de|&s;ign in execution.&mdash;The circum&s;tances of their captivity are known to &s;everal officers in our army.</P>
<P>They are de&s;irous of entering into our &s;ervice, ob&s;erving that there are a number of German officers in the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition with them&s;elves, who will re&s;ign and join us, if they find that the&s;e meet with proper countenance.&mdash;It appears to me that important advantages may attend the encouraging a di&s;po&s;ition of this nature (if it really exi&s;ts,&mdash;which is far from being im|po&s;&s;ible) from the influence it will nece&s;&s;arily have upon the &s;oldiery by increa&s;ing that &s;pirit of de&s;ertion and di&s;content which already prevails among them.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="031423_0553_0FEC5FDD1BADF3E8">
Congre&s;s will be&s;t judge of the propriety of employing the&s;e gentlemen.&mdash;I have been thinking in what manner it might be done; and the mode lea&s;t exceptionable, which at pre&s;ent oc|curs to me, is to authori&s;e them to rai&s;e a corps for them&s;elves, by enli&s;ting &s;uch German inhabitants, and &s;uch de&s;erters from the foreign troops, as may be willing to engage. The corps at fir&s;t, as it is only by way of experiment, need not be large, but may be afterwards increa&s;ed as circum&s;tances &s;hall point out. This mea&s;ure, I apprehend, cannot be attended with any material in|convenience, and may be productive of utility. If the gentle|men are employed at all, it mu&s;t be in a new corps, as they could not be introduced into any of tho&s;e already formed, with|out injuring the officers in them, and producing di&s;&s;atisfaction, murmurs, and re&s;ignations.</P>
<P>I have founded them on the plan here &s;ugge&s;ted, and they &s;eem to be very &s;anguine in its &s;ucce&s;s, and anxious to undertake it.&mdash;They expect &s;ome augmentation in rank; and indeed it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary, in order the more effectually to intere&s;t others to follow their example: but caution &s;hould be u&s;ed not to car|ry the idea too far; becau&s;e, be&s;ides other weighty con&s;idera|tions, the higher the rank conferred on them, the more difficult it will be to provide for tho&s;e who may hereafter come to us, and who will of cour&s;e frame their expectations by compari&s;on.</P>

<P>I DO my&s;elf the honor of tran&s;mitting to Congre&s;s the in|clo&s;ed memorial of colonel Rawlings, pre&s;ented in behalf of him&s;elf and the Maryland officers who were under his command in the year 1776. The facts which are &s;tated in it are gene|rally true; and I cannot but feel my&s;elf exceedingly intere&s;ted in favor of the&s;e gentlemen. The conduct of this whole corps, when Fort-Wa&s;hington was attacked, is &s;o generally known and approved, that it is almo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary to add upon the &s;ubject. However I think it but ju&s;tice to ob&s;erve that every repre&s;ent|ation of that day's tran&s;action gave them the highe&s;t credit.&mdash;They fought with a degree of veteran bravery; and, though but a handful, they maintained their ground a con&s;iderable time, notwith&s;tanding the mo&s;t vigorous efforts to force them. All who were &s;pectators upon the occa&s;ion have declared this; and the enemy them&s;elves have not refu&s;ed them applau&s;e.</P>
<P>It &s;eems hard that officers of their merit &s;hould be overlook|ed,&mdash;and a lo&s;s to the &s;ervice that they &s;hould remain unem|ployed: but the con&s;equences that would attend their incorpo|ration with any of the corps now exi&s;ting appear too di&s;agree|able, to try the experiment. Colonel Rawlings him&s;elf, from the information I have had, does not incline to give any unea&s;i|ne&s;s to the line of the army, and would rather make a di&s;tant part of it again&s;t the Indians, in ca&s;e he could be provided for in that way. Captain Beall, who is charged with this, will be able to inform Congre&s;s more fully than I can of the wi&s;hes of
<PB N="260" REF="031423_0556_0FEC606DA358D018">
the colonel and the re&s;t of his officers; and his account may lead perhaps to &s;ome &s;uitable and practicable provi&s;ion for them. As I have ob&s;erved before, they are men who de&s;erve well of their country.&mdash;I only mention the Maryland officers upon this occa&s;ion, becau&s;e that part of the corps which came from Virgi|nia was provided for by the &s;tate in their pre&s;ent arrangement, as I have been credibly advi&s;ed.</P>
<P>Mr. Rawlings was never in the complete and actual command of the regiment under his direction as colonel, becau&s;e he never obtained a commi&s;&s;ion: but he became entitled to it according to the then common rule of promotion by the death of colonel Stephen&s;on, and the non-acceptance of colonel Morgan who was appointed to it. Of the latter circum&s;tance Mr. Rawlings, I am per&s;uaded, was never appri&s;ed, as it was kept a &s;ecret from an apprehen&s;ion that the enemy might claim an officer of the rank of colonel in exchange for Morgan who was then a pri&s;on|er on parole, if his promotion came to their knowledge.&mdash;Ma|jor Williams of the Maryland part of the corps was appointed by the &s;tate to one of her regiments now in the field, and is the only officer in his predicament I know of, that they arranged.</P>

<P>I HAD ye&s;terday the honor to receive your favor of the twentieth in&s;tant.&mdash;I take the liberty of tran&s;mitting you a co|py of a letter which this minute came to hand from general Sullivan, advi&s;ing of the count D'E&s;taing's arrival. He omit|ted to inclo&s;e the admiral's letter to which he refers; and there|fore I can give no further intelligence than what the copy con|tains.&mdash;From the &s;uffering of the fleet, the &s;torm mu&s;t have been exceedingly &s;evere at &s;ea.</P>
<P>I al&s;o inclo&s;e two York papers of the nineteenth and twenti|eth. The&s;e mention an engagement off Sandy-Hook on the &s;ix|teenth. It could only have been partial on the &s;ide of the French &s;quadron at any rate, as the Languedoc and the &s;eventy-four-gun &s;hips mu&s;t have lo&s;t their ma&s;ts before that time.&mdash;It would &s;eem by the account given in the papers, that the I&s;is and &s;ome other &s;hips on the part of the enemy had been damaged.</P>

<P>INCLOSED you will be plea&s;ed to receive a copy of a letter of the twenty-third in&s;tant from general Sullivan, which came to hand about half after three o'clock this morning, with the &s;everal papers to which it refers, copies of which are al&s;o tran&s;mitted. By the&s;e, Congre&s;s will perceive our pro&s;pects are much changed with re&s;pect to the operations again&s;t Rhode-I&s;land; and that the i&s;&s;ue, as things are now circum&s;tanced,&mdash;whether we look to a continuation of the &s;iege, to an immedi|ate attack, or a retreat,&mdash;mu&s;t be attended with great difficul|ty and ri&s;k.&mdash;I tru&s;t the wi&s;e&s;t mea&s;ures will be pur&s;ued; and I will hope for the be&s;t.</P>

<P>P. S. General Sullivan, I think, mu&s;t be under a mi&s;take as to the amount of the relief which the enemy had attempted to give from York.&mdash;I have u&s;ed every po&s;&s;ible means to gain in|formation from time to time on this head; and I never could learn, either from de&s;erters or others who had been in the city, that any troops had embarked &s;ince the reinforcement &s;ent up the Sound long ago, except &s;ome draughts to act in the fleet as marines.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WOULD take the liberty to inform Congre&s;s that colo|nel Armand is come to camp with his corps, and has applied to me for commi&s;&s;ions for his officers.&mdash;By the re&s;olution for e&s;ta|bli&s;hing the corps, it was to be officered out of the foreigners then commi&s;&s;ioned in our &s;ervice, who were not nor could be provided for in any of the regiments. In&s;tead of this, there are only three officers in the corps who before held any com|mi&s;&s;ions in our &s;ervice, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> lieutenant-colonel Vrigney, and captains Mercley and Shafner. The two la&s;t were only lieu|tenants, and are now appointed to captaincies, contrary (it &s;eems to me) to the &s;pirit and intention of the re&s;olution.</P>
<P>As colonel Armand has departed from his in&s;tructions which mu&s;t govern me, I am not authori&s;ed to grant the commi&s;&s;ions he requires, and am therefore under the nece&s;&s;ity of troubling Congre&s;s with the arrangement of the corps, No. 1, as it now actually &s;tands for their con&s;ideration and deci&s;ion.&mdash;The colo|nel founds his deviation from the re&s;olve upon &s;ome verbal in|timation
<PB N="262" REF="031423_0558_0FEC606FD4A18E20">
given him that the part in que&s;tion would not be in|&s;i&s;ted on.</P>
<P>I would al&s;o take the liberty to mention that general Du Portail lately delivered me a memorial, in which, among other things, he repre&s;ents that he had made an agreement with Con|gre&s;s at his fir&s;t appointment, that neither him&s;elf nor the other gentlemen with him &s;hould be commanded by any of the engi|neers who had preceded them in our army.&mdash;I could not but an&s;wer that the commi&s;&s;ions of officers were the only rule of precedency and command I had to judge by; and, while others held &s;uperior appointments, I mu&s;t con&s;ider them accordingly in the cour&s;e of &s;ervice. He gave me the inclo&s;ed letter to you upon the &s;ubject, and is extremely anxious to have the matter placed upon a certain footing: and, no doubt, it will be for the good and tranquility of the &s;ervice that the claim be determined as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible one way or the other. At the &s;ame time I think it right to ob&s;erve that it cannot be expected that colonel Co&s;ciu&s;ko, who has been a good while in this line, and conducted him&s;elf with reputation and &s;atis|faction, will con&s;ent to act in a &s;ubordinate capacity to any of the French gentlemen except general Du Portail. * * *</P>
<P>Since I had the honor of writing you on the twenty-fifth in|&s;tant, I have not received a &s;ingle line from general Sullivan. The only intelligence I have from the ea&s;tward is from mon|&s;ieur Pontjobean. This gentlemen left Rhode-I&s;land the twen|ty-&s;eventh, and arrived about two hours ago in camp. From him I learn that our people were &s;till on the i&s;land;&mdash;that it was generally thought they had made effectual provi&s;ion for a retreat in ca&s;e of exigency;&mdash;that in the evening of that day he met mon&s;ieur Preville, an officer belonging to the Langue|doc, at Providence, going with di&s;patches to general Sullivan,&mdash;who informed him that the French fleet had got into Bo&s;ton.&mdash;He further adds that mon&s;ieur Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oune who was in company with him at Providence, and who had more conver&s;ation with mon&s;ieur Preville than he him&s;elf had, told him that mon&s;ieur Preville &s;aid count D'E&s;taing had &s;ailed or was on the point of &s;ailing again for Rhode-I&s;land with ten &s;hips of the line and his frigates.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been duly honored with your favor of the twenty-eighth and that of the thirtieth ultimo, with the &s;everal inclo&s;ures to which they refer.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s may rely that I will u&s;e every po&s;&s;ible means in my power to conciliate any differences that may have ari&s;en in con&s;equence of the count D'E&s;taing's going to Bo&s;ton, and to prevent a publication of the prote&s;t upon the occa&s;ion.&mdash;Seve|ral days before the receipt of the re&s;olution, I had written to the ea&s;tward, urging the nece&s;&s;ity of harmony, and the expedi|ency of affording the admiral every a&s;&s;i&s;tance to refit his &s;hips. This I repeated after the re&s;olution came to hand; and I have al&s;o taken opportunity to reque&s;t all the general officers here to place the matter in the mo&s;t favorable point of view whene|ver they hear it mentioned.</P>
<P>The five hundred guineas, which Congre&s;s were plea&s;ed to order, came &s;afe to hand, and &s;hall be appropriated to the pur|po&s;es they intended, and as the exigency of the &s;ervice may re|quire.&mdash;For want of &s;upplies of this &s;ort, we have been very deficient in intelligence in many important and intere&s;ting points. In &s;ome ca&s;es, no con&s;ideration in paper money has been found &s;ufficient to effect even an engagement to pro|cure it: and, where it has been otherwi&s;e, the terms of &s;er|vice, on account of the depreciation, have been high, if not ex|orbitant.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign of the enemy, as to their future movements, re|main yet entirely [<HI>in the dark</HI>]: but the expectation of their leaving the continent is daily decrea&s;ing. The hurricane &s;ea|&s;on &s;eems oppo&s;ed to their going to the We&s;t-Indies; and the pa&s;&s;age to Europe in a little time will become more and more dangerous. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there is another circum&s;tance, of
<PB N="264" REF="031423_0560_0FEC6047F6693AD0">
&s;ome weight, if true, to induce a belief that they mean to &s;tay. It appears by the papers that part of the regiments lately rai&s;|ed in Britain are ordered to Halifax. If the troops here were intended to be recalled, it would &s;eem that &s;ome of them would be &s;ent to reinforce that gar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;on &s;ooner than troops from Eng|land or Scotland; and hence I think it may be pre&s;umed that another campaign will take place in America, e&s;pecially if ad|mini&s;tration are di&s;appointed in their expectations from the commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Where the theatre of war may be, mu&s;t be a matter of con|jecture. But, as it is an acknowledged fact that an army act|ing in the ea&s;tern &s;tates mu&s;t derive flour for its &s;upport from tho&s;e more we&s;tern, I &s;ubmit to Congre&s;s the expediency, and, in my opinion, the nece&s;&s;ity, of e&s;tabli&s;hing, without lo&s;s of time, magazines of this article at convenient places (removed from the Sound) in Connecticut and Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. I am the more induced to wi&s;h an early con&s;ideration of this point, as, by a &s;udden move of the army, (&s;hould events make it nece&s;&s;a|ry) the departments of commi&s;&s;ary and quarter-ma&s;ter would be greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. Nor would &s;uch magazines, I &s;hould imagine, be attended with any con&s;iderable lo&s;s, though the ar|my &s;hould not operate in that quarter, as the flour would an|&s;wer occa&s;ionally for our &s;hipping, and the &s;urplus might in all probability be otherwi&s;e readily di&s;po&s;ed of.</P>
<P>I take the liberty of tran&s;mitting to Congre&s;s a memorial I received from the reverend Mr. Tetard.&mdash;From the certificates annexed to it, he appears to be a man of great merit; and from every account, he has &s;uffered in the extreme in the pre&s;ent conte&s;t. His attachment, &s;ervices, and misfortunes, &s;eem to give him a claim to a generous notice: but, according to the new e&s;tabli&s;hment of the army, it is not in my power to make any provi&s;ion for him. I therefore recommend his ca&s;e to the attention and con&s;ideration of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Six o'clock, P. M.</HI>&mdash;I this minute received a letter from general Sullivan, of which the inclo&s;ure, No. 2, is a copy. I &s;hall be exceedingly happy if a perfect reconciliation has taken place between him and the count and all the officers.&mdash;His letter will &s;hew &s;ome of the rea&s;ons that led to the prote&s;t, and that it was the hope of our officers that it would have operated as a ju&s;tification to the admiral, to return again&s;t the &s;entiments of his council, e&s;pecially as it coincided (as it is &s;aid) with his own inclination.&mdash;I had the&s;e rea&s;ons from another hand when the prote&s;t fir&s;t came.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="031423_0561_0FEC5FE6CA36E228">
<HI>September</HI> 5.&mdash;I was duly honored ye&s;terday evening with your favor of the thirty-fir&s;t ultimo.&mdash;Though it is not expre&s;&s;|ed in the re&s;olution of that date that any other bounty is to be given to the men who engage for three years or during the war, than twenty dollars, I &s;hall take it for granted they are to re|ceive the u&s;ual allowances of clothing and land.&mdash;There are &s;e|veral continental troops who&s;e time of &s;ervice will expire at the end of the fall or during the winter. I &s;hall con&s;ider the&s;e within the meaning and operation of the re&s;olve, though they are not mentioned; and &s;hall direct every nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ure to be taken to re-enli&s;t them.</P>
<P>From the exorbitant &s;tate, town, and &s;ub&s;titute bounties, I am very doubtful whether twenty dollars will be found &s;uffici|ent to engage &s;o great a proportion either of the draughts or continentals, as was at fir&s;t apprehended. Our failure in the enterpri&s;e again&s;t Rhode-I&s;land will have its weight; and every day, from the approach of the fall and winter, will add new difficulties. As it is a work of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential importance, I will order it to be begun the the in&s;tant the money arrives: and, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t, on experiment, the &s;um &s;hould prove too &s;mall, I would &s;ubmit it to Congre&s;s whether it will not be expedient to pa&s;s another re&s;olve, abthori&s;ing a further bounty of ten dol|lars, to be u&s;ed as circum&s;tances may make it nece&s;&s;ary. This can remain a &s;ecret, and will not be carried into execution but in ca&s;e of evident nece&s;&s;ity.&mdash;I feel very much intere&s;ted upon the occa&s;ion, and have &s;ubmitted this mode, that there may not be the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible delay in attempting to engage the men under a &s;econd expedient if the fir&s;t &s;hould not &s;ucceed.&mdash;The articles of clothing and blankets &s;hould al&s;o employ the utmo&s;t attention to provide them: we are now in great want, particu|larly of the latter; there not being le&s;s than actually wanted at this moment.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD the plea&s;ure to hear this morning, by a letter from general Sullivan, of the thirty-fir&s;t ultimo, that he had effected a retreat to the main, the preceding night, without any lo&s;s either of men or &s;tores. As he has written to Con|gre&s;s fully upon the &s;ubject, and I feel their anxiety to hear
<PB N="266" REF="031423_0562_0FEC600E037FC468">
it, I &s;hall not detain major Morris longer than to ob&s;erve that I think the retreat a mo&s;t fortunate, lucky, and well-timed event.</P>
<P>Major Morris informs me he has heard that lord Howe was off Bo&s;ton with his fleet: and it appears by a New-York paper of the &s;econd, that rear admiral Parker arrived at Sandy-Hook on this day week with &s;ix &s;hips of the line, of &s;eventy four guns each,&mdash;which is corroborated by other accounts.&mdash;I tran&s;mitted the intelligence to his excellency count D'E&s;taing ye&s;terday and the day before, as it acquired more and more the appearance of certainty,&mdash;as I have regularly done every occurrence intere&s;ting to his fleet and our operations.</P>

<P>I TAKE the liberty of laying before Congre&s;s the in|clo&s;ed copies of a paragraph and &s;chedule contained in a letter from general Heath, which I lately received.

<P>Since I had the honor of addre&s;&s;ing you on the fourth and fifth in&s;tant, I have obtained a return of the blankets which are now deficient.

<P>I DO my&s;elf the honor of returning to Congre&s;s the re|port of their committee on the &s;ubject of an in&s;pector&s;hip (tran&s;mitted in your letter of the twentieth ultimo, which was not received till the thirty-fir&s;t), with &s;uch ob&s;ervations as have occurred to me in con&s;idering the matter, and which I have made with a freedom that I tru&s;t will be agreeable to Congre&s;s. I wi&s;h it had been in my power to have returned it before: but the intervention of a variety of other important bu&s;ine&s;s from
<PB N="267" REF="031423_0563_0FEC5FEB06D1AE88">
time to time obliged me to po&s;tpone a conclu&s;ion upon the points till ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>I have already, in my letter of the twenty-&s;ixth of July, de|livered my &s;entiments upon the con&s;equences that would attend the baron Steuben's being appointed to an actual and perma|nent command in the line; and therefore I will not trouble Congre&s;s with a repetition of them. However, I will take the liberty to add that I am more and more convinced that what I then &s;aid upon the occa&s;ion was well founded; and that I am certain &s;uch a mea&s;ure will produce at lea&s;t infinite di&s;contents and di&s;quietudes among the general officers.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o had the honor to receive your favor of the fifth in&s;tant, with the &s;everal papers to which it refers. The&s;e &s;hall have my attention as far as practicable.&mdash;I hope all the con&s;e|derate troops are on the march from Philadelphia; and, if they are not, that immediate orders will be given for their joining the army.</P>
<P>The inclo&s;ed copy of a letter from general Sullivan, of the tenth in&s;tant, will inform Congre&s;s that the enemy have not re|linqui&s;hed their burning plans, and that in this way they have de&s;troyed &s;everal hou&s;es, &s;tores, and ve&s;&s;els, at and near Bed|ford.</P>
<P>I was advi&s;ed on wedne&s;day night that a body of them, con|&s;i&s;ting of four or five thou&s;and, under general Grey, had made a landing in that quarter, and were intrenching. In con&s;equence of this, and from an apprehen&s;ion that general Clinton might po&s;&s;ibly mean to operate to the ea&s;tward, and form &s;ome project in concert with lord Howe again&s;t the count D'E&s;taing's &s;qua|dron, I determined to move the troops from this ground to a rear po&s;ition, better calculated to afford &s;upport to the works on the North-river, in ca&s;e an attempt &s;hould be made again&s;t them, and at the &s;ame time more convenient for forwarding de|tachments to the ea&s;tward, if the enemy point their operations that way.</P>
<P>I was the more induced to come to this determination as mo&s;t of the accounts from New-York &s;eemed to lead to a belief, as they &s;till do, that a con&s;iderable movement was and is in con|templation, if not an entire evacuation of the city, and this by water. Be&s;ides the&s;e rea&s;ons, the principal objects for taking po&s;t here do not now exi&s;t. One was to create every po&s;&s;ible jealou&s;y in favor of the expedition again&s;t Rhode-I&s;land; ano|ther the con&s;uming the forage within its vicinity and towards King&s;bridge. The former is now over, and the latter in a great degree accompli&s;hed.</P>

<P>SINCE I had the honor of addre&s;&s;ing you on the twelfth in&s;tant, I have received your &s;everal favors of the tenth, twelfth and &s;ixteenth, with the re&s;olutions to which they allude.&mdash;I tran&s;mitted the Briti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners the re&s;olve of the fourth in&s;tant re&s;pecting the convention troops the morning after it came to hand, and al&s;o wrote to &s;ir Henry Clinton upon the &s;ubject of pa&s;&s;ports.&mdash;I have not received his an&s;wer.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the magazines, I have directed the commi&s;|&s;ary to form them on the inland communication from hence to Bo&s;ton, at proper intervals. The twenty thou&s;and barrels of flour that Congre&s;s have ordered to be purcha&s;ed will be a va|luable addition, if they can be tran&s;ported by water; but it &s;eems to me there will be great ri&s;k of its being lo&s;t, if it is &s;ent by &s;ea while the enemy have a &s;uperior fleet on our coa&s;t.</P>
<P>As the campaign is not clo&s;ed yet, all our cavalry are of u&s;e.&mdash;They lie in the neighborhood of the enemy's po&s;ts, for the purpo&s;e of re&s;training their parties, and for obtaining and giving intelligence of the enemy's movements; and they are &s;ub&s;i&s;ted upon the forage which would otherwi&s;e be expo&s;ed to them.&mdash;I am &s;en&s;ible that the&s;e corps are attended with great expen&s;e; and the moment I think the &s;ervice will admit of it, they or a part of them &s;hall be quartered in different places di&s;tant from the army, where they may be provided for on better terms.&mdash;The price of forage; and the difficulty of getting it, are really objects of great magnitude, and &s;uch as &s;hould undergo &s;ome regulation, if there is any that can be adopted.&mdash;I received let|ters a few days ago from the commi&s;&s;ary and quarter ma&s;ter upon this &s;ubject, copies of which, and of my letter in con&s;e|quence to the &s;everal &s;tates from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay to Penn|&s;ylvania inclu&s;ive, I take the liberty to inclo&s;e.</P>
<P>The re&s;olution prohibiting officers, except &s;uch as are &s;peci|ally authori&s;ed, to keep hor&s;es in the army or within forty miles of it, has been publi&s;hed in orders, and I will take every &s;tep in my power to give it effect.</P>
<P>I have con&s;idered the practicability of reducing the teams em|ployed in the army, and find, however de&s;irable the object may be, that it cannot be done. We have not at this time more than are ab&s;olutely and indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary, nor &s;o many as would be nece&s;&s;ary in ca&s;e of a rapid movement: neither does it ap|pear to me that there can be a &s;ub&s;titution of ox for hor&s;e teams,
<PB N="269" REF="031423_0565_0FEC47C28B001DC8">
at lea&s;t to any great extent; nor that any material advantages would ari&s;e from &s;uch a mea&s;ure. There might perhaps be a &s;mall &s;aving in the article of provender: but this, I fear, would be greatly over-balanced by the lo&s;s of cattle that would be ap|propriated to the u&s;e of the commi&s;&s;ary's department. After a full inve&s;tigation of the &s;ubject, I believe we &s;hall be obliged to adhere to the kind of teams we now employ, and that the only relief we &s;hall have in point of expen&s;e will ari&s;e from &s;ending a part of the hor&s;es to places where they can more ea&s;ily be foraged, when we have fixed our camp and quarters for the winter.</P>
<P>I beg leave to mention to Congre&s;s that there is a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome mode's being e&s;tabli&s;hed, by which claims on the old quarter-ma&s;ter&s;hip, that remain un&s;atisfied, may be di&s;charged. There are many of this nature; and the&s;e, however well au|thenticated they may be, the gentlemen now in office do not conceive them&s;elves at liberty to adju&s;t, without obtaining &s;ome &s;pecial direction for the purpo&s;e. I am every day applied to for payment of &s;uch accounts, and, in many in&s;tances, have been obliged, as well for the &s;ake of ju&s;tice to individuals as for the public good, to order them to be taken up. It appears to me that Congre&s;s cannot be too early in their re&s;olution upon this occa&s;ion, and that either the pre&s;ent department &s;hould be au|thori&s;ed to &s;ettle and pay &s;uch claims, or that &s;ome per&s;ons &s;hould be appointed and &s;upplied with money for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The army marched from White-Plains on the &s;ixteenth in|&s;tant, and is now encamped in different places.&mdash;Three brigades, compo&s;ing the Virginia troops, part of the right wing, under the command of general Putnam, are at Robin&s;on's near We&s;t-Point: and two brigades more, compo&s;ing the remainder, are with baron De Kalb at Fi&s;hkill plains, about ten miles from the town, on the road lead leading to Sharon. The &s;econd line, with lord Stirling, is in the vicinity of Frederic&s;burg; and the whole of the left wing at Danbury under the command of gene|ral Gates.&mdash;The&s;e &s;everal po&s;ts appear to be the be&s;t we can occupy in the pre&s;ent doubtful &s;tate of things, as they have re|lation to the &s;upport of We&s;t-Point, in ca&s;e of an attack in that quarter, and are al&s;o on the communication to the ea&s;tward, if the enemy point their operations that way.&mdash;Be&s;ides the&s;e di&s;|po&s;itions, general Scott with a light corps remains below in the country about King's-Street.</P>
<P>The letter from &s;ir Henry Clinton which I have the honor of tran&s;mitting was &s;ent to me to-day by colonel Baylor who is po&s;t|ed at Hackin&s;ac. He &s;ays he received one for me by the &s;ame flag; and, from his note, he &s;uppo&s;ed he had charged the hor&s;e|man

If this &s;hould be the ca&s;e, you will be &s;o obliging as to return it to me by the fir&s;t con|veyance.&mdash;I was al&s;o informed by colonel Baylor that a con&s;i|derable body of the enemy landed at Paulus' Hook in the even|ing of the twenty-&s;econd, and were encamped that night in the woods between four and five miles from the town of Bergen. He had not learned their object: but it is likely they are after forage.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE following is an extract of a letter of the &s;eventeenth in&s;tant, which I had the honor to receive from the count D'|E&s;taing.</P>
<P>"I entreat you to promote the exchange of pri&s;oners alrea|day planned by mon&s;ieur Girard. The unhappy per&s;ons taken before the commencement of ho&s;tilities cannot be fully regard|ed as pri&s;oners: their lot is dreadful. The mode adopted for exchanging them by means of your commi&s;&s;ary, without intro|ducing the king's name or mine into the tran&s;action, removes a great part of the political difficulties which before &s;ub&s;i&s;ted."</P>
<P>I am an entire &s;tranger to the plan above referred to, or to the mode that has been adopted for exchanging by means of our commi&s;&s;ary. He is ab&s;ent from the army: and I mu&s;t therefore beg the favor of you to obtain from mon&s;ieur Girard &s;uch information as will enable me to give directions for carry|ing the count's de&s;ires into execution, if practicable.</P>
<P>The marquis De Vienne, at pre&s;ent at Bo&s;ton, has reque&s;ted a furlough of eighteen months to enable him to return to France, whither he is called by &s;ome dome&s;tic concerns. I do not conceive my&s;elf at liberty to grant his reque&s;t without the permi&s;&s;ion of Congre&s;s, to whom I would beg leave to ob&s;erve, that, if agreeable to them, he may be indulged without pre|judice to the &s;ervice, as he is not attached to any particular command.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t received an account from Jer&s;ey, which I fear is too true, that colonel Baylor's regiment of dragoons were &s;ur|pri&s;ed in their quarters the night before la&s;t, and mo&s;t of them killed or taken.&mdash;A few of the &s;tragglers have come in, who can give but a very imperfect account of the matter. They
<PB N="271" REF="031423_0567_0FEC5F1544C7A200">
think the colonel and mo&s;t of the officers were made pri&s;oners, and that the privates were put to the &s;word.&mdash;There were, I imagine, about one hundred men of the regiment together when this unlucky accident happened.</P>
<P>The &s;tay of the enemy in Jer&s;ey being longer than I appre|hended, and not knowing what their real intentions may be, I have ordered general Maxwell to advance from Elizabethtown to the neighborhood of Aquakenunk bridge, and have &s;ent over general Woodford's brigade from this &s;ide of the river. I have al&s;o ordered general Pula&s;ki to advance with as much expedition as po&s;&s;ible, and join the brigades.&mdash;Lord Stirling has this day gone over to take the command of the continental forces and militia who are a&s;&s;embling in con&s;iderable numbers. If the enemy mean only to forage, they will be kept from ex|tending them&s;elves, by the&s;e troops: and if they have any de|&s;igns upon the po&s;ts in the Highlands, they will be prevented from &s;eizing the pa&s;&s;es leading to the forts, by lord Stirling, who will be between them and the enemy, and always ready to po&s;&s;e&s;s them.</P>
<P>I have made proper di&s;po&s;itions on this &s;ide the river for the &s;ecurity of the Highlands in ca&s;e that body of the enemy, who are on this &s;ide King&s;bridge employed in collecting forage, &s;hould advance.</P>
<P>The &s;ketch of Rhode-I&s;land, forwarded by this expre&s;s, was received from general Sullivan, and left behind by accident when the la&s;t di&s;patches were &s;ent off.</P>
<P>I have had the honor of receiving yours of the twentieth, inclo&s;ing an order for count Pula&s;ki's legion to advance to Trenton.</P>

<P>Being &s;eparated from my papers, I am uncertain whether I mentioned in my la&s;t, that, the enemy in the Jer&s;eys having received a reinforcement and made &s;ome forward movements, I had thought it expedient to detach another brigade thither to act in conjunction with the one already there together with Pula&s;ki's corps and the militia, and had &s;ent major-general

<P>That part of Baylor's regiment which e&s;caped came off in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and were afterwards brought off in &s;o diper&s;|ed a manner that the number has not been a&s;certained: but, from what I have learned, I &s;hould e&s;timate the lo&s;s at about fifty men and &s;eventy hor&s;es.&mdash;Major Clough is dead of his wounds.&mdash;This affair &s;eems to have been attended with every circum&s;tance of cruelty.</P>
<P>It is a &s;mall compen&s;ation for this accident, that colonel But|ler three or four days ago, with a party of infantry and hor&s;e comprehending major Lee's corps, &s;urpri&s;ed about a hundred Yagers below Tarrytown, killed ten on the &s;pot, and took a lieutenant and eighteen men pri&s;oners.&mdash;The roughne&s;s of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ountry facilitated the flight of the re&s;t, and prevented the &s;uc|ce&s;s being more complete.</P>

<P>THIS will be delivered to you by major-general the mar|quis De la Fayette.&mdash;The generous motives, which fir&s;t induc|ed him to cro&s;s the Atlantic and enter the army of the United States, are well known to Congre&s;s.&mdash;Rea&s;ons equally laudable now engage his return to France, which in her pre&s;ent circum|&s;tances claims his &s;ervices.&mdash;His eagerne&s;s to offer his duty to his prince and country, however great, could not influence him to quit the continent in any &s;tage of an unfini&s;hed campaign. He re&s;olved to remain at lea&s;t till the clo&s;e of the pre&s;ent, and embraces this moment of &s;u&s;pen&s;e to communicate his wi&s;hes to Congre&s;s with a view of having the nece&s;&s;ary arrangements

<P>The marquis at the &s;ame time, from a de&s;ire of pre&s;erving a relation with us, and a hope of having it yet in his power to be u&s;eful as an American officer, &s;olicits only a furlough &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;es above-mentioned.&mdash;A reluctance to part with an officer, who unites to all the military fire of youth an uncom|mon maturity of judgment, would lead me to prefer his being ab&s;ent on this footing, if it depended on me. I &s;hall always be happy to give &s;uch a te&s;timony of his &s;ervices as his bravery and conduct on all occa&s;ions entitle him to; and I have no doubt that Congre&s;s will add &s;uitable expre&s;&s;ions of their &s;en&s;e of his merit, and their regret on account of his departure.</P>

<SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE ince&s;&s;ant and pre&s;&s;ing applications of the officers, and their real di&s;tre&s;s for clothing, oblige me to repeat my wi&s;h|es to the board, to obtain the earlie&s;t direction of Congre&s;s for relieving their wants.&mdash;They are in a very di&s;agreeable &s;itua|tion in this re&s;pect; and, unle&s;s &s;ome mode can be adopted for &s;peedily &s;upplying them, many will be obliged involuntarily to quit the &s;ervice; or, if this &s;hould not be the ca&s;e, we &s;hall be involved in perpetual complaints, and the mo&s;t painful applica|tions.</P>
<P>I do not recollect, when the army was fir&s;t appointed, that there was any engagement on the part of the public that the officers &s;hould be provided with clothing through their means; nor has there been any explicit declaration &s;ince, that I remember, for the purpo&s;e: but the mea&s;ure has become indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;|&s;ary; and, without the intervention of public aid, they never can be &s;upplied: for their pay, if the articles proper could be found in a private way, (from the enormous and exorbitant prices now exacted for every thing) would prove wholly incompetent to the end.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="031423_0570_0FEC607CCA03CFF0">
There is however a re&s;olution of Congre&s;s, of the twenty-&s;e|cond of November la&s;t, which points to a provi&s;ion through the public means and tho&s;e of the &s;tates individually taken. This has encouraged the officers to look for &s;upplies in the manner there profe&s;&s;ed; and their not being able to obtain them makes them more unea&s;y perhaps than if the re&s;olution had never pa&s;|&s;ed.</P>
<P>I have written to me&s;&s;ieurs Otis and Andrews to make a re|turn of the cloth, &amp;c. in their hands, proper for officers, and al&s;o to advi&s;e me what quantities might be procured in ca&s;e the board &s;hould direct a purcha&s;e. This appears to be the only practicable expedient at this time, from which relief can be drawn: and, if it is to be adopted, the agents cannot be too &s;oon ordered to carry it into execution.&mdash;I really wi&s;h to be inform|ed by the board by the fir&s;t opportunity whether the officers may expect &s;upplies through the public &s;tores, that I may be able to an&s;wer them deci&s;ively upon the point when they apply. As matters now &s;tand, I am in a very awkward and irk&s;ome &s;i|tuation.</P>
<P>Since it is evident that the officers cannot provide them&s;elves with clothing, and that there is a nece&s;&s;ity for the intervention of the public aid, I would &s;ubmit it to the board whether it may not be proper for them to form an e&s;timate of clothing, propor|tioned to the number of officers in the army, for the con&s;idera|tion of Congre&s;s, and to obtain their &s;anction for importing the &s;ame, if they approve the plan. This mea&s;ure, it &s;eems to me is the only one that can en&s;ure relief in future; and it appears the more eligible as the lo&s;s to the public will be infinitely le&s;s than if they procure the articles in the country, &s;uppo&s;ing that it could be done. Be&s;ides this con&s;ideration, the officers then might be properly uniformed and all placed on a ju&s;t and equal footing.</P>
<P>If the board &s;hould be authori&s;ed to direct an immediate purcha&s;e of clothing for the officers, I will take the liberty to &s;ugge&s;t that it may not be improper for them to enjoin on the part of the clothier a &s;tricter compliance with the re&s;olution of Congre&s;s, which I have mentioned, in the &s;ale. The officers &s;ay that hitherto it has not had the nece&s;&s;ary and generous operation intended by Congre&s;s; but, on the contrary, in the few in&s;tan|ces in which they have been able to furni&s;h them&s;elves with ar|ticles from the public &s;tores, that they have done it at the cur|rent exorbitant prices.&mdash;Indeed there are many matters in the department which require a more perfect and explicit arrange|ment than has ever been made&punc; and at pre&s;ent there is &s;uch a
<PB N="275" REF="031423_0571_0FEC5F3CED12C9B0">

<P>I do my&s;elf the honor of tran&s;mitting you an account of the engagement between the French and Briti&s;h fleets on the twen|ty-&s;eventh of July, as publi&s;hed by the Briti&s;h admiralty-board.&mdash;I received a printed copy of it la&s;t night from New-York, which I have forwarded to his excellency count D'E&s;taing.&mdash;It is evident from admiral Keppel's own relation of the affair, that he was pretty &s;everely handled, notwith&s;tanding he affects in the conclu&s;ion to mention that he wi&s;hed extremely for an opportunity to renew the combat the next day.</P>
<P>We are &s;till in great &s;u&s;pen&s;e as to the operations and de&s;igns of the enemy, though every practicable mea&s;ure has been u&s;ed and is pur&s;uing to come at them.

<P>I have had the misfortune to hear that the Raleigh frigate has become a prize to two Briti&s;h &s;hips of war after a long and very gallant re&s;i&s;tance. Captain Barry, finding that the frigate would fall into the enemy's hands, ran her a&s;hore on Seal-I&s;land, to which he e&s;caped in boats with about eighty of his hands, and from thence to the main. It is &s;aid he took mea&s;ures for blow|ing her up, but was defeated in his purpo&s;e by the perfidy of an under officer who concealed him&s;elf and remained on board.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE letter which I had the honor of addre&s;&s;ing to you the day before ye&s;terday would inform Congre&s;s of the embark|ation and &s;ailing of a con&s;iderable detachment of the enemy from New-York, and of the mea&s;ures I had taken in expecta|tion of and upon the happening of the event.&mdash;Whether this will be &s;ucceeded by a further embarkation, or by a total eva|cuation of the po&s;ts which they hold within the &s;tates, in the cour&s;e of this year or the en&s;uing one, I cannot pretend to de|termine. But, as it will be right and prudent in us to provide for every contingency, I would with the greate&s;t deference &s;ub|mit it to Congre&s;s whether it may not be proper for them to call upon the &s;tates to provide men in time for filling their re&s;|pective battalions, before or at any rate again&s;t the opening of the &s;pring, and in the &s;ame manner as if there was a moral cer|tainty that the war would be pro&s;ecuted with all po&s;&s;ible vigor on the part of Britain. Should this not be the ca&s;e, or &s;hould
<PB N="277" REF="031423_0573_0FEC60761E9C26B0">
any events ca&s;t up in the mean time to render troops unnece&s;|&s;ary, it will be ea&s;y to di&s;band the levies and to keep them from the field,&mdash;while, on the other hand, our relaxation in not providing them may &s;ubject us at lea&s;t to many di&s;agreea|ble con&s;equences.</P>
<P>The general return of the infantry in the month of Septem|ber, tran&s;mitted to the board of war by the adjutant-general, and to which I beg leave to refer, will &s;hew Congre&s;s the whole amount of our reputed force at that time. But I am to ob&s;erve, that large, very large deductions are to be made from it on ac|count of the columns of &s;ick, and the men &s;aid to be on com|mand. Many under the former de&s;cription, particularly that of &s;ick ab&s;ent, are actually dead; others unfit for &s;ervice; and &s;everal, who have recovered, have de&s;erted: nor will the latter afford more than one half of its number in time of action, as various duties, &s;uch as waggoning, di&s;tant guards, e&s;corts, &amp;c. employ a great proportion of tho&s;e under this denomination.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the above deductions, Congre&s;s will perceive from the return which I now take the liberty of tran&s;mitting, that there are four thou&s;and three hundred and eighty draughts and others, who&s;e terms of &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rvice will expire during and by the clo&s;e of winter: for I am &s;orry to add that our exertions to re|engage the draughts and old &s;oldiers in this predicament, for the u&s;ual bounty, have proved &s;o far ineffectual and without &s;ucce&s;s. I have not tried what effect the additional grant of ten dollars might have: but I fear, and it &s;eems to be the opi|nion of all I have con&s;ulted upon the occa&s;ion, that it would have but little if any influence. I know, in the ca&s;e of the draughts and troops of one &s;tate, that the offer of twenty dol|lars on the part of the continent, with a like allowance and an actual depo&s;it of it by the &s;tate, has been no temptation.</P>
<P>The general reluctance and refu&s;al is founded in the unhappy depreciated light in which the &s;oldiery view the money, and their expectation of receiving immen&s;e &s;tate, di&s;trict, and &s;ub|&s;titute bounties. Whether grants or bounties by Congre&s;s, bearing &s;ome proportion to the&s;e, to &s;uch as &s;hould enli&s;t for the war, would be attended with better &s;ucce&s;s, I cannot un|dertake to decide. The experiment may be made if they judge it proper: and if it proves an inducement of any extent, it will be an infinite &s;aving in the end. I believe however our &s;ure&s;t and only certain aids will be derived from draughting, which I tru&s;t may and will be done by the &s;tates on the recom|mendation of Congre&s;s, agreeable to the mode mentioned in my letter to their committee when they fir&s;t honored me with

a vi&s;it at Valley-Forge. The exertions to recruit by volunta|ry enli&s;tments may &s;till go on, as both modes in all probability will not produce near as many men as may be found nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>In the ca&s;e of the Carolina troops who&s;e &s;ervice is ending every day, the officers &s;ay that nothing will induce them to enli&s;t, unle&s;s they can be permitted to go home on furlough till the &s;pring. On this indulgence they &s;eem to think &s;everal might be engaged.&mdash;The di&s;tance is great, and there will be &s;ome uncertainty as to their returning: be&s;ides, it will be fix|ing a precedent for others.&mdash;If Congre&s;s approve the plan, they will be plea&s;ed to inform me by the earlie&s;t opportunity.</P>
<P>I am under &s;ome difficulty about clothing the draughts, and the old &s;oldiers who&s;e &s;ervice is expiring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> will determine every day. As Congre&s;s have never expre&s;&s;ed their &s;en&s;e up|on the &s;ubject, and this is increa&s;ed by a letter which I receiv|ed &s;ome time ago from the board of war, which re&s;pects parti|cularly the draughts, I mu&s;t earne&s;tly reque&s;t that Congre&s;s will favor me with the &s;peedie&s;t direction in the ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, whether they are to be furni&s;hed out of the &s;upplies coming on, equally with the other troops. At the &s;ame time I will take the li|berty to offer it as my opinion, that, however inconvenient or expen&s;ive it may appear at the fir&s;t view to clothe them, the mea&s;ure will be nece&s;&s;ary, and founded not only in humanity but found policy. We have no pro&s;pect now of levying men in any other way: and if they are not clothed, they will be ex|hau&s;ted by &s;ickne&s;s and death; and not doing it may prove an in&s;urmountable bar or at lea&s;t a great ob&s;tacle to our obtaining future aids, though the exigencies of our affairs &s;hould be ne|ver &s;o pre&s;&s;ing. Yet the clothes may be withheld as long as circum&s;tances will permit, as an inducement for them to enli&s;t. In the in&s;tance of the old &s;oldiers who have not received the annual allowance of Congre&s;s, the point &s;eems clearly in their favor.&mdash;The board &s;ugge&s;ted that the draughts might be &s;up|plied out of the be&s;t of the old clothes which might be given in by the troops on receiving new ones:&mdash;but unfortunately there will be few of any worth.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been honored with yours of the nineteenth, twenty-&s;eventh, twenty-eighth, and twenty-ninth, ultimo.</P>
<P>A tolerable &s;upply of &s;hoes has lately arrived to the i&s;&s;uing clothier's &s;tore from the ea&s;tward, Penn&s;ylvania, and Jer&s;ey&punc; and, if the different per&s;ons employed in procuring that article will exert them&s;elves to keep up the &s;upply, I hope we &s;hall not be much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed during the winter, provided we remain quietly in quarters.</P>
<P>It is much to be wi&s;hed that Congre&s;s would come to a &s;pee|dy re&s;olution concerning the procuring clothing for the officers at a price in proportion to their pay, more e&s;pecially, as they were led to expect this from a re&s;olve which pa&s;&s;ed in Novem|ber 1777.&mdash;If the clothing it&s;elf cannot be conveniently pro|cured, I imagine the alternative of allowing an adequate &s;um of money in lieu thereof would be the next be&s;t expedient.</P>
<P>As the board mu&s;t undoubtedly have experienced the many difficulties ari&s;ing from the want of a proper arrangement of the clothier's department, I hope they will pre&s;s the committee who have that bu&s;ine&s;s in charge, to bring in their report, that the new &s;y&s;tem may be carried into execution without lo&s;s of time.&mdash;Whether it has been owing to want of conduct in the late officer, or his want of proper powers and directions, I will not undertake to determine: but the irregularity in that de|partment has been an endle&s;s &s;ource of trouble to me, and a great cau&s;e of di&s;content in the army.</P>
<P>I have given the i&s;&s;uing clothier directions to keep an account of the marks and numbers of the bales of blankets, and of the quality of their contents, from whence you will be able to trace from whom tho&s;e &s;mall ones were purcha&s;ed. When the i&s;&s;ues are completed, you &s;hall have the account.&mdash;The directions to Mr. Mea&s;e were very proper.&mdash;If any corps want completing in any particular article which is not to be procured here, I will &s;ign the order my&s;elf.</P>
<P>In the pre&s;ent &s;carcity of hats, the caps of which you have
<PB N="282" REF="031423_0578_0FEC5F9A5FCC4A10">
forwarded a pattern mu&s;t be u&s;ed by way of &s;ub&s;titute. But an officer very attentive to the health of his men informs me that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> an inconvenience from the u&s;e of woollen caps la&s;t winter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;tead of hats; when the men put them off in the &s;pring, they ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> of them took violent colds from the &s;udden tran&s;i|tion. They al&s;o contribute to keep the head dirty,&mdash;than which nothing is more unhealthy.</P>
<P>I find it impracticable to carry the recommendation of the board, re&s;pecting calling in the old clothes upon delivery of the new, into execution. The &s;oldiers were not to be convinc|ed of the good policy and economy intended by the application of the old clothes to ho&s;pitals and the followers of the army, but looked upon it as an unju&s;tifiable attempt to deprive them of what they had earned by their year's &s;ervice, and what (con|&s;idering the &s;canty &s;upply of &s;ome kinds of covering, blankets in particular) would help to make them more comfortable du|ring the winter. The&s;e di&s;contents were communicated to me, the moment they aro&s;e, by &s;ome of the be&s;t officers in the line; which determined me to let the matter drop, more e&s;pecially as another argument was made u&s;e of, which was unan&s;werable: this was, that, upon a fair &s;ettlement, there would be found a con&s;iderable deficiency of the bounty-clothing for a year or two pa&s;t, and that therefore it would be more equitable to make up the deficiency than to draw in the remains.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON wedne&s;day afternoon I received a letter from the honorable Mr. Lee and Mr. Lovell of the committee for fo|reign affairs, inclo&s;ing a plan and &s;undry re&s;olutions of Congre&s;s for attacking Canada the next campaign in conjunction with the forces of his mo&s;t chri&s;tian maje&s;ty,&mdash;and reque&s;ting my ob&s;ervations upon the &s;ame to be tran&s;mitted to Congre&s;s, and a copy to be delivered to the marquis De la Fayette. The&s;e di&s;patches, through the indi&s;po&s;ition of the marquis (who un|fortunately was &s;eized with a fever in his journey from Phila|delphia, which &s;till detains him at Fi&s;hkill), were prevented coming to hand till that time: and the great importance and extent of the &s;ubject they comprehend would not permit me the honor of an earlier communication of my &s;entiments.&mdash;I hope Congre&s;s will excu&s;e my not complying with that part of the re&s;olution which requires me to deliver a copy of my ob|&s;ervations.
<PB N="283" REF="031423_0579_0FEC5FFD9C25EEC0">
to the marquis, as the manner in which I am obliged to treat the &s;ubject opens &s;uch a pro&s;pect of our wants and our weakne&s;&s;es, as, in point of policy, ought only to be knows to our&s;elves.</P>
<P>I am-always happy to concur in &s;entiment with Congre&s;s; and I view the emancipation of Canada as an object very inte|re&s;ting to the future pro&s;perity and tranquility of the&s;e &s;tates: but I am &s;orry to &s;ay the plan propo&s;ed for the purpo&s;e does not appear to me to be eligible under our pre&s;ent circum&s;tan|ces.&mdash;I con&s;ider it as my duty, and what Congre&s;s expects from me, to give my rea&s;ons for this opinion with that frank|ne&s;s and candor which the importance of the &s;ubject demands; and, in doing this, I am per&s;uaded I &s;hall not fail to meet with their approbation.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to me impolitic to enter into engagements with the court of France for carrying on a combined operation of any kind without a moral certainty of being able to fulfil our parts, particularly if the fir&s;t propo&s;al came from us. If we &s;hould not be able to perform them, it would argue either a want of con&s;ideration, a defective knowledge of our re&s;ources, or &s;ome|thing wor&s;e than either, which could not fail to produce a de|gree of di&s;tru&s;t and di&s;content that might be very injurious to the Union. In the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, &s;hould the &s;cheme propo&s;ed be adopted, a failure on our part would certainly occa&s;ion in them a mi&s;application of a con&s;iderable land and naval force which might be u&s;efully employed el&s;ewhere, and probably their total lo&s;s.&mdash;It is true, if we were at this time to enter into the engagement, we &s;hould be every day better able to judge whe|ther it will be in our power to accompli&s;h what may be expect|ed from us: and, if we &s;hould find hereafter that our re&s;ources will be unequal to the undertaking, we may give notice to the court of France in &s;ea&s;on to prevent the &s;ailing of the troops and the ill effects that might attend it. But be&s;ides that a pro|ject of this kind could not be embraced by France without its having, an influence on the whole &s;y&s;tem of operations for the next campaign, which of cour&s;e would receive &s;ome derangement from its being abandoned,&mdash;a renunciation of this could not fail to give a very unfavorable impre&s;&s;ion of our fore&s;ight and pro|vidence, and would &s;erve to weaken the confidence of that court in our public councils.</P>
<P>So far from the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e being a moral certainty of our complying with our engagements, it may in my opinion be very &s;afely pro|nounced, that, if the enemy keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their pre&s;ent po&s;ts at New-York and Rhode-I&s;land, it will be impracticable either
<PB N="284" REF="031423_0580_0FEC607E665723C8">
to furni&s;h the men or the other nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies for pro&s;ecut|ing the plan. They will not attempt to keep tho&s;e po&s;ts with le&s;s than ten thousand men and a con&s;iderable navy.&mdash;If it &s;hould be thought be&s;t for the advantage of carrying on the expeditions intended, to forego any offen&s;ive operations again&s;t the&s;e garri|&s;ons, and to leave them in quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch important places, we &s;hall at lea&s;t be obliged to provide for the &s;ecurity of the country again&s;t their incur&s;ions and depredations, by keep|ing up a force &s;ufficient to confine them within their own limits. It is natural too to &s;uppo&s;e that the people's expectations of be|ing protected will grow &s;tronger in proportion to the diminution of the enemy's force, and the greater facility with which it can be afforded. They will hardly be content to continue in a &s;tate of alarm and in&s;ecurity from a force &s;o incon&s;iderable, while the principal &s;trength of the &s;tates is drawn out in the pro&s;ecution of remote objects.&mdash;If this rea&s;oning is ju&s;t, we &s;hall be obliged to have a larger force than the enemy, po&s;ted in different places to prevent &s;udden inroads which they would otherwi&s;e be able to make at different points: and the number required cannot be e&s;timated at le&s;s than twelve or fifteen thou&s;and men. This will be two thirds as large a force as we have been able to rai&s;e and maintain during the progre&s;s of the war, as the&s;e calcula|tions both of the enemy's &s;trength and of our own are meant to de&s;ignate the number of effective rank and file.</P>
<P>If I rightly under&s;tand the plan in con&s;ideration, it requires for its execution twelve thou&s;and &s;ix hundred men rank and file. Be&s;ides the&s;e,&mdash;to open pa&s;&s;ages through a wilderne&s;s for the march of the &s;everal bodies of troops,&mdash;to provide the means of long and difficult tran&s;portations by land and water,&mdash;to e&s;tabli&s;h po&s;ts of communication for the &s;ecurity of our con|voys,&mdash;to build and man ve&s;&s;els of force nece&s;&s;ary for acquiring a &s;uperiority on the lakes;&mdash;the&s;e and many other purpo&s;es pe|culiar to the&s;e enterpri&s;es, which would be tedious in detail,&mdash;will demand a much larger proportion of artificers and per&s;ons to be employed in manual and laborious offices, than are u&s;ual in the ordinary cour&s;e of military operations. When we add the whole together, the aggregate number of men requi&s;ite for the &s;ervice of the en&s;uing campaign will be little le&s;s than dou|ble the number heretofore in the field: but to be more certain in the calculation, it may be placed at only one half more.</P>
<P>Experience is the only rule to judge by in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e.&mdash;Every expedient has been exhau&s;ted in the preceding cam|paigns to rai&s;e men; and it was found impo&s;&s;ible to get toge|ther a greater force than we had, though the &s;afety and &s;ucce&s;s
<PB N="285" REF="031423_0581_0FEC5F9F02A8ADE8">
of the cau&s;e &s;eemed ab&s;olutely to require it. The natural and direct inference therefore is, that the re&s;ources of the country were inadequate to a larger &s;upply. I cannot then &s;ee that we can hope upon any principle to be equal to &s;o much greater ex|ertions next year, when the people and the army appear to grow daily more tired of the war, and the depreciation of our money continually increa&s;ing, and of con&s;equence proving a &s;maller temptation to induce them to engage.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of our &s;upplies for tran&s;porting and &s;ub&s;i&s;ting the troops will &s;tand upon a footing equally bad. We have encoun|tered extreme difficulties in the&s;e re&s;pects, and have found that it was full as much as we were competent to, to food the army we have already had, and enable it to keep the field and perform the movements required by the contingencies of the &s;ervice. It is not likely that the&s;e difficulties will dimini&s;h; but on the con|trary they will rather multiply as the value of our currency le&s;|&s;ens: and the enormous prices to which provi&s;ions have ri&s;en, and the artificial &s;carcity created by monopolies, with what we have to fear from the effect of the &s;ame &s;pirit, give us no rea&s;on to flatter our&s;elves that our future pro&s;pects can be much bet|ter.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation of things we are hardly warranted to expect that we &s;hall have it in our power to &s;atisfy the demands of num|bers &s;o much greater than we have yet had to &s;upply, e&s;pecially if we con&s;ider that the &s;cene of our operations has hitherto been in the heart of the country furni&s;hing our re&s;ources, which of cour&s;e facilitated the drawing them out,&mdash;and that we &s;hall then be carrying on the war at an immen&s;e di&s;tance, in a coun|try wild and uncultivated, incapable of affording any aid, and great part of it ho&s;tile. We cannot in this ca&s;e depend on tem|porary or occa&s;ional &s;upplies, as we have been accu&s;tomed, but mu&s;t have ample magazines laid up beforehand. The labor and expen&s;e in forming the&s;e, and tran&s;porting the nece&s;&s;ary &s;tores of every kind for the u&s;e of the troops, will be increa&s;ed to a degree that can be more ea&s;ily conceived than de&s;cribed. The tran&s;portation mu&s;t be, a great part of the way, through de&s;erts affording no other forage than herbage; and, from this circum|&s;tance, our principal &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the fle&s;h kind mu&s;t be &s;alted, which would not only be an additional expen&s;e in the addition|al con&s;umption of &s;o &s;carce and dear an article as &s;alt, but would greatly increa&s;e the difficulty both of providing and tran&s;porting. My letter of the twenty-ninth ultimo (tran&s;mitting a copy of one from the quarter-ma&s;ter-general) which I had the honor of addre&s;&s;ing to Congre&s;s, and to which I wi&s;h to refer, will point
<PB N="286" REF="031423_0582_0FEC6080F9BDC8B8">
out the difficulties and daily expen&s;e attending our &s;upplies of the article of flour only, in our pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, exclu&s;ive of its co&s;t,&mdash;and lay the foundation for a fort of comparative e&s;timate to be formed of tho&s;e that would attend the &s;upport of troops when employed at &s;o great a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>If, in addition to all this, we &s;hould have the French fleet to &s;upply during the winter,&mdash;the likelihood of which I have no &s;ufficient information to ground a judgment upon,&mdash;it will ap|pear &s;till more impracticable to furni&s;h the &s;upplies requi&s;ite for the exten&s;ive operations propo&s;ed. But, independent of this, the improbability of doing it is, in my apprehen&s;ion, infi|nitely too great to ju&s;tify the undertaking.</P>
<P>This rea&s;oning is founded on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the enemy do not evacuate their pre&s;ent po&s;ts at New-York and Rhode-I&s;land: nor can we pre&s;ume upon any pa&s;t appearances &s;o far as to determine the contrary, and enter into a national contract, the fulfilment of which at any rate, in my judgment, will de|pend on this event. Opinions on the &s;ubject are various, and the arguments on both &s;ides cogent. Circum&s;tances have hi|therto been very indeci&s;ive:&mdash;at Rhode-I&s;land there is nothing that looks like an evacuation, that I have heard of:&mdash;at New-York, the length of time that has elap&s;ed &s;ince the event has been expected, which cannot be &s;atisfactorily accounted for, it not a little doubtful and problematical.</P>
<P>But if it were even certain that the enemy would &s;hortly leave the&s;e &s;tates, I &s;hould think our ability to carry on the expedi|tions meditated (from the nature of the country, and the remote|ne&s;s from the &s;ource of our &s;upplies, joined to the di&s;couraging &s;ituation of our finances) too precarious to authori&s;e a precon|certed agreement with a foreign power, binding our&s;elves to the attempt. On the other hand, if we were certain of doing our part, a co-operation by the French would, in my opinion, be as delicate and precarious an enterpri&s;e as can be imagined. All the rea&s;ons, which induce France and the United States to wi&s;h to wre&s;t Canada and Halifax from the dominion of England, o|perate with her perhaps more forcibly to u&s;e every po&s;&s;ible effort for their defence. The lo&s;s of them would be a deadly blow to her trade and empire. To hope to find them in a defencele&s;s &s;tate, mu&s;t be founded in a &s;uppo&s;ition of the total incapacity of Britain both by land and &s;ea to afford them protection.&mdash;I &s;hould apprehend we may run into a dangerous error by e&s;ti|mating her power &s;o low.</P>
<P>We have been informed that a &s;trong garri&s;on has been late|ly &s;ent to Halifax, amounting, by report, to about four thou&s;and
<PB N="287" REF="031423_0583_0FEC6085816FFB20">
men:&mdash;a part of the detachments which the enemy are now making from New-York are currently &s;aid to be, and in all pro|bability are, de&s;tined for that place:&mdash;if they evacuate entirely, a very con&s;iderable part of their force will no doubt go there;&mdash;and in any ca&s;e we may expect that reinforcements will be thrown from thence into Canada early in the &s;pring. The En|gli&s;h are now greatly &s;uperior to the French by &s;ea in America, and will from every appearance continue &s;o unle&s;s Spain inter|po&s;e,&mdash;an event which I do not know we are authori&s;ed to count upon. However, as I am de&s;titute of information with re&s;pect to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of European politics, this is a point upon which I can form but an imperfect judgment: but if it &s;hould not take place. I think it infinitely probable, from the maritime &s;ituation and advantages of Halifax, which is repre&s;ented as the fine&s;t port and be&s;t naval ar&s;enal in America,&mdash;from the &s;ecu|rity it is calculated to give to the general trade and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of Britain, both on the continent and in the We&s;t-Indies,&mdash;that it will be a &s;tation for a larger naval force than the one intended to to convoy the French troops:&mdash;it will naturally be the principal rendezvous of the Briti&s;h &s;hips of war in Ameri|ca. If this po&s;ition be admitted,&mdash;&s;hould the Engli&s;h have any knowledge or even &s;u&s;picion of the de&s;ign of the French court to &s;end a fleet up the river Saint Laurence, nothing will be ea&s;ier than to intercept this fleet on its way, or to take or de&s;troy it after it has got in. Nor can we flatter our&s;elves with keeping this bu&s;ine&s;s a &s;ecret. Congre&s;s perhaps will be &s;urpri&s;ed to be told that it is already in more hands than they &s;u&s;pect: and, in the progre&s;s of the negotiation in France, it will get into many more. The preparations will announce the intention.&mdash;It is indeed a part of the plan to avow the de&s;tina|tion of the French troops, though this is to be contradicted by the manner of their clothing, &amp;c.&mdash;The &s;tationing troops this winter, as is propo&s;ed, particularly on the Mohawk and Con|necticut river, would be unequivocal proops of the de&s;ign: it mu&s;t at lea&s;t excite the &s;tronge&s;t &s;u&s;picion, &s;o as to put the En|gli&s;h nation upon their guard, and make them take precautions to counteract it.</P>
<P>But if the French troops &s;hould arrive before Quebec, I think their &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t that &s;trong place, fortified by every advantage of nature and of art, would be extremely doubtful.&mdash;It is &s;uppo&s;ed this capital po&s;t will be found in &s;o weak a con|dition as to make its &s;urrender a matter of cour&s;e, owing to the enemy's having previou&s;ly drained them&s;elves for the defence of Detroit, Niagara, Saint John's, Montreal, &amp;c. but we cannot
<PB N="288" REF="031423_0584_0FEC60900897A948">
depend that this will be the ca&s;e:&mdash;they may e&s;teem it the part of prudence rather to &s;acrifice or at lea&s;t to hazard the extremi|ties in order to collect their &s;trength at the heart. Montreal indeed, and the po&s;ts e&s;&s;ential to it, mu&s;t be defended, becau&s;e the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them would throw too large a part of the coun|try into our hands. But if reinforcements are &s;ent to Canada early in the &s;pring,&mdash;a circum&s;tance extremely likely,&mdash;the&s;e may be attended to without too far weakening the garri&s;on at Quebec; and, as before ob&s;erved, we cannot build upon their conduct's being regulated by an ignorance of our plans. The French troops in&s;tead of a coup-de-main, would in this ca&s;e be reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of carrying on a blockade.</P>
<P>I will now take the liberty to turn my attention towards the operations of our own troops. The one again&s;t Detroit I &s;hall at pre&s;ent &s;ay nothing about: if well conducted, I &s;hould hope that place would fall without very great difficulty.&mdash;The ca&s;e is very different with re&s;pect to Niagara. This, I am informed, is one of the &s;tronge&s;t fortre&s;&s;es in America, and can only be reduced by regular approaches or by famine. In accompli&s;h|ing this, la&s;t war, and a conque&s;t as far as Montreal, I believe general Amher&s;t exhau&s;ted two campaigns, with all the advan|tages which he derived from the united efforts of Britain and America, with every convenience for water-tran&s;portation, in|cluding plenty of &s;eamen, and with money that commanded every thing which either country could furni&s;h. The former mode would require great per&s;everance, time, and labor, and an ap|paratus which it would be almo&s;t impracticable to tran&s;port. The latter is practicable, but very difficult. To effect it, we mu&s;t gain a &s;uperiority on the lakes, The enemy have already a re&s;pectable force there:&mdash;if they &s;u&s;pect our de&s;ign, which they cannot fail to do from the mea&s;ures to be taken, they may improve the interval in adding to it; and, by providing mate|rials and artificers upon the &s;pot, they may be able to increa&s;e it &s;o as to keep pace with us. It is therefore ea&s;y to &s;ee that we ought not to be too &s;anguine in the &s;ucce&s;s of this expedition, and that, if a moderate force be imployed in the defence of Nia|gara without degarni&s;hing Quebec and the intermediate po&s;ts, its reduction will be a very arduous ta&s;k.</P>
<P>The body of troops to penetrate by way of the river Saint Francis mu&s;t meet with great ob&s;tacles: they will have a march of about a hundred and fifty miles from Coho&s;s, which is about a hundred and &s;ixty miles beyond Hartford, a great part of which is through a hitherto-uninhabited and trackle&s;s country, with an immen&s;e train of waggons: all the &s;tores and provi&s;ions
<PB N="289" REF="031423_0585_0FEC5F24103B4218">
for the whole march, and the future &s;upply of the troops, at lea&s;t till they &s;hould get footing in Canada, mu&s;t accompany them from the beginning. The impediments and delays in &s;uch a march almo&s;t exceed conception.</P>
<P>When arrived at the Saint Laurence, fre&s;h ob&s;tacles proba|bly would pre&s;ent them&s;elves. The pre&s;umption is, that, if the enemy could not make head there, they would de&s;olate the country through which they were to pa&s;s, de&s;troy all the provi&s;ion and forage, remove every kind of water craft, and demoli&s;h the materials for building others. The&s;e precautions being taken on the Sorelle and Saint Laurence would pretty effectually ob|&s;truct our progre&s;s both to Montreal and Cadoroqui,&mdash;to &s;ay no|thing of the rapidity of the current and the numerous rifts be|tween Montreal and Lagalette.</P>
<P>When we deliberately con&s;ider all the ob&s;tacles in the execu|tion, and the difficulties we &s;hall find in preparing the va&s;t ma|gazines required, which have been already enumerated, if with|in the compa&s;s of our re&s;ources, we &s;hall be led to think it not very improbable that this body may be unable to penetrate Ca|nada, at lea&s;t in time to co-operate with the French troops, if a co-operation &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary. The &s;ituation of the&s;e troops then would be delicate and dangerous:&mdash;expo&s;ed to a defeat from the united force of the enemy, in great danger of having their retreat cut off by a &s;uperior naval force in the river, they would have every thing to fear. On the other hand, if our ope|rations &s;hould be as &s;ucce&s;sful as we may flatter our&s;elves, a tempe&s;t or a Briti&s;h fleet may deprive us of our expected aid; and at a critical moment we may find our&s;elves in the bo&s;om of an enemy's country, obliged to combat their whole force with one inferior and reduced by a tedious and wa&s;ting march. The five thou&s;and men, when they arrived in Canada, would proba|bly little exceed four capable of &s;ervice; and would be &s;till le&s;s, if out of them we &s;hould e&s;tabli&s;h po&s;ts as we advanced, to in|&s;ure a retreat and protect e&s;corts of provi&s;ion which mu&s;t follow for future &s;upport. Thus an accident in either ca&s;e would in|volve the defeat of the whole project; and the cata&s;trophe might be attended with the mo&s;t unhappy con&s;equences to America.</P>
<P>The plan propo&s;ed appears to me not only too exten&s;ive and beyond our abilities, but too complex. To &s;ucceed, it requires &s;uch a fortunate coincidence of circum&s;tances as could hardly be hoped, and cannot be relied on;&mdash;the departure of the ene|my from the&s;e &s;tates, without which we cannot furni&s;h the &s;tipu|lated force, or &s;upplies to maintain them,&mdash;&s;uch a want of pow|er or want of fore&s;ight in the enemy as will oblige then to ne|glect
<PB N="290" REF="031423_0586_0FEC604E55109BD0">
the reinforcement of Halifax and of Canada, and prevent them, however conveniently &s;ituated, from the di&s;puting the pa&s;&s;age of the four &s;hips of the line and four frigates up the ri|ver Saint Laurence, or attempting their de&s;truction afterwards,&mdash;&s;uch a combination of favourable incidents as will enable &s;e|veral bodies acting &s;eparately and independently by &s;ea and land, and from different countries, to conform to times and periods &s;o as to en&s;ure a co-operation;&mdash;the&s;e and many other circum|&s;tances mu&s;t con&s;pire, to give &s;ucce&s;s to the enterpri&s;e.</P>
<P>Congre&s;s, I am per&s;uaded, had powerful rea&s;ons for fixing the convoy at the number they have: and their &s;uperior informati|on re&s;pecting the affairs of Europe at this pre&s;ent juncture ena|bles them to judge much better than I can pretend to do, of its &s;ufficiency. But from the imperfect view I have of the mat|ter, I have been led, in con&s;idering the &s;ubject, to look upon it as in&s;ufficent. From the general tenor of intelligence, the En|gli&s;h out-number the French in the channel: in America, both on the continent and in the i&s;lands, they are greatly &s;uperior. If the la&s;t Toulon fleet is employed in the Mediterranean, the French may have the &s;uperiority there: but, upon the whole, the balance of naval force &s;eems hitherto to be on the &s;ide of the Engli&s;h. If we add to this that the number of &s;hips of war in the French ports, built or building, bears no compari&s;on to the number in the Engli&s;h ports,&mdash;and that Britain notwith|&s;tanding the diminution &s;he has &s;uffered, is &s;till a kingdom of great maritime re&s;ources,&mdash;we &s;hall be di&s;po&s;ed to conclude that the preponderance is too likely to continue where it is. The interpo&s;ition of Spain indeed would make a very intere&s;ting change; but her backwardne&s;s heretofore &s;eems to be an argu|ment that &s;he is withheld from interfering by &s;ome weighty poli|tical motives: and how long the&s;e may continue to re&s;train her, is a que&s;tion I am unqualified to determine.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e general objections to the plan which have been &s;tated, there appear to me to be &s;ome particular ones which I &s;hall take the liberty to point out.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place I ob&s;erve there are to be five thou&s;and mili|tia employed in the two expeditions again&s;t Detroit and Niaga|ra.&mdash;The drawing into &s;ervice &s;o large a number compo&s;ed chiefly of hu&s;bandmen, in addition to what may be found nece&s;|&s;ary for other exigencies on the coa&s;t at &s;o intere&s;ting a &s;ea&s;on of the year, will certainly be very injurious to the culture of our lands, and mu&s;t tend to add to the deficiency of &s;upplies. But this, though not to be overlooked, is not the principal ob|jection.&mdash;In the expedition again&s;t Detroit, militia perhaps may
<PB N="291" REF="031423_0587_0FEC6007699026E8">
an&s;wer, as it is not a po&s;t of very great &s;trength, and may po&s;&s;i|bly be abandoned on or in a little time after the approach of a force that cannot be oppo&s;ed in the field, and the garri&s;on pro|ceed to reinforce that of Niagara. But even here troops of another kind would be far preferable. However, the ca&s;e will be very different with re&s;pect to this la&s;t:&mdash;it is, as I have be|fore mentioned, one of the &s;tronge&s;t fortre&s;&s;es of America, and demands for its reduction the very be&s;t of troops. Militia have neither patience nor per&s;everance for a &s;iege. This has been demon&s;trated by all the experience we have had. An attempt to carry on one which &s;hould materially depend on them would be liable to be fru&s;trated by their incon&s;tancy in the mo&s;t criti|cal moments.&mdash;Agreeable to the plan under con&s;ideration, three thou&s;and five hundred out of five thou&s;and &s;ix hundred are to be militia.</P>
<P>It is a part of the plan that the troops &s;ent again&s;t Detroit, whe|ther &s;ucce&s;sful or not, are to form a junction with tho&s;e at Nia|gara. It appears to me on the contrary, that the expedition a|gain&s;t Detroit, under the pre&s;ent arrangement, mu&s;t &s;tand on its own bottom, and have no other object than the reducing that place and de&s;troying the adjacent Indian &s;ettlements. Lake Erie is certainly occupied by two armed ve&s;&s;els of &s;ixteen and eighteen guns, and, it is &s;aid, by five or &s;ix others of &s;maller &s;ize, having two, three, or four guns each, which, while the ene|my hold Niagara, will prevent the communication of our troops by way of the lake,&mdash;to &s;ay nothing for want of batteaux for tran&s;portation. A communication by land mu&s;t be performed through an extent of more than four hundred miles, and a great part of this at lea&s;t under many di&s;advantages of route, and through tribes of ho&s;tile Indians.</P>
<P>My knowledge of the country is not &s;ufficiently accurate to enable me to di&s;cover the rea&s;ons which determined Congre&s;s to divide the force de&s;tined again&s;t Niagara, and to appoint the march of one body from Ononguaga to that place. It &s;eems to me however that this di&s;po&s;ition might be &s;ubject to one great inconvenience, which is, that, if each column be not &s;uperior to the whole collective force of the enemy, they ri&s;k being beaten &s;eparately and &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, be&s;ides the trouble and expen&s;e of preparing as it were for two expeditions in&s;tead of one,&mdash;of opening two roads in&s;tead of one,&mdash;and the uncertainty of a co-operation (if no di&s;a&s;ter &s;hould happen to either) at the mo|ment when it might be nece&s;&s;ary. The inquiries I have as yet had it in my power to make are oppo&s;ed to the practicability of conveying cannon in the route from Ononguaga to Niagara, or
<PB N="292" REF="031423_0588_0FEC60921B1CBC20">
at lea&s;t place it as a point infinitely doubtful: and, without can|non, nothing can be effected again&s;t that po&s;t. Upon the whole, the great matter e&s;&s;ential to &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t Niagara is to &s;ubdue the enemy's force on lakes Eric and Ontario, particularly the latter. This once done, and the garri&s;on by that means cut off from its &s;upplies, the fort will be likely to fall an ea&s;y prey. Here our efforts &s;hould be directed: nor do I at pre&s;ent perceive the purpo&s;es to be an&s;wered by the body going from Ononguaga, unle&s;s the deva&s;tation of the intermediate Indian villages be the object,&mdash;which perhaps may not be equal to the ri&s;k, labor, and expen&s;e, and the more &s;o as they would fall of cour&s;e if we &s;hould &s;ucceed in the general operation.</P>
<P>The cantoning five thou&s;and troops this winter on Connecti|cut-river, under our pre&s;ent pro&s;pects, will, in my opinion be impracticable, and, in any ca&s;e, unadvi&s;able.&mdash;When I had the honor of writing to Congre&s;s in September la&s;t on the &s;ubject of a winter campaign into Canada, I had been led by [<HI>colonel</HI>] Bai|ley, and other gentlemen acquainted with the country, to ex|pect that very con&s;iderable magazines of provi&s;ions might be laid up on the upper parts of that river. But it appears on ex|periment that their zeal for the expedition made them too &s;an|guine in the matter. The purcha&s;es fall far &s;hort of what was expected. The difficulties of tran&s;portation, as repre&s;ented by the quarter-ma&s;ters and commi&s;&s;aries, &s;upported by facts that &s;peak for them&s;elves, are &s;o great and &s;o complicated that I &s;hould have no hope of being able, from remote parts of the continent, to throw in the quantity requi&s;ite for &s;ub&s;i&s;ting the&s;e troops during the winter, and at the &s;ame time of forming the magazines which would be nece&s;&s;ary to pro&s;ecute the expedition in &s;pring. We may be endeavouring to form the magazines: but the troops cannot be on the &s;pot this winter; otherwi&s;e they will exhau&s;t the provi&s;ion as fa&s;t as it can be collected.&mdash;The &s;ame objection applies to the &s;tationing troops on the Mohawk|river.</P>
<P>In e&s;timating our force for the next campaign, it is to be con&s;idered that upwards of four thou&s;and of the pre&s;ent army will have completed their terms of &s;ervice by the la&s;t of May next, and that a great proportion of the remainder will have done the &s;ame about the clo&s;e of the en&s;uing fall, unle&s;s they can be induced to re-engage,&mdash;of which the ill &s;ucce&s;s of our pre&s;ent exertions to enli&s;t tho&s;e who&s;e engagements are about to expire afford but an unfavorable pro&s;pect. This and the general temper of the officers, di&s;&s;atisfied much with their &s;itu|ation,
<PB N="293" REF="031423_0589_0FEC6054CC49C468">
will &s;ugge&s;t a &s;trong argument again&s;t the exten&s;ive pro|jects in contemplation.</P>
<P>In whatever point of light the &s;ubject is placed, our ability to perform our part of the contract appears to me infinitely too doubtful and precarious to ju&s;tify the undertaking, A failure, as I have already ob&s;erved, would involve con&s;equences too de|licate and di&s;agreeable to be hazarded. But, at the &s;ame time that my judgment is again&s;t this, I am clearly of opinion that we &s;hould attempt every thing that our circum&s;tances will per|mit: but, as the extent of our power mu&s;t be regulated by many po&s;&s;ible events, I would wi&s;h to hold our&s;elves free to act according to either po&s;&s;ibility, and as a clearer view of our fu|ture re&s;ources may authori&s;e.&mdash;If the enemy entirely leave the&s;e &s;tates, it will produce a va&s;t change in our affairs; and new pro&s;pects may open, of which we can at pre&s;ent have but a very imperfect idea. It would be a great &s;tep towards rai&s;ing the value of our money, which would give a new &s;pring to our military operations.&mdash;We may be able to undertake much more than we can now fore&s;ee.</P>
<P>If the enemy attempt to keep po&s;ts in the&s;e &s;tates, a primary object will be to expel them if in our power:&mdash;if not we mu&s;t make proper provi&s;ion to bar their depredations, and mu&s;t turn our attention to the &s;ecurity of our frontiers, by pur&s;uing &s;uch mea&s;ures as &s;hall be within the reach of our abilities.&mdash;Though we may not be able to launch into &s;o wide a field as we could wi&s;h, &s;omething upon a more particular &s;cale may be enterpri&s;|ed. Detroit and Niagara may perhaps be reduced, though Canada may not be an acce&s;&s;ion to the confederacy.&mdash;With a view to what is po&s;&s;ible, preparations may be going on, and we can make &s;uch an application of them as we &s;hall find practica|ble.</P>
<P>As there is no time to be lo&s;t in doing this, I &s;hall give the nece&s;&s;ary orders &s;o far as relates to the article of provi&s;ion, which indeed has been already done it part. Magazines of forage, materials for boat and &s;hip building, and other articles, mu&s;t al&s;o be provided,&mdash;which will depend on the final arrange|ments and more definitive in&s;tructions of Congre&s;s. The&s;e mea&s;ures will be nece&s;&s;ary to be taken whether the pre&s;ent plan is carried on, or whether &s;omething le&s;s exten&s;ive, depend|ing wholly on our&s;elves, is &s;ub&s;tituted in its place.&mdash;I &s;hall wait the further orders of Congre&s;s for the government of my conduct in delivering the plan to the marquis as their re&s;olution &s;eems to require, or in tran&s;mitting it immediately to doctor Franklin as the letter from the committee &s;eems to direct.

<P>I DO my&s;elf the honor to tran&s;mit you the copy of a letter of the tenth in&s;tant, which I received ye&s;terday from &s;ir Henry Clinton, on the &s;ubject of exchanging the pri&s;oners of the con|vention.&mdash;Should the propo&s;ition be agreeable to Congre&s;s, I &s;hall be glad to receive powers to enter into a negotiation as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, as it may probably relieve our officers upon parole from the di&s;agreeable nece&s;&s;ity of returning to New-York. I will ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that, &s;hould an exchange take place upon the terms propo&s;ed by &s;ir Henry, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e we &s;hall not be obliged to give up any con&s;iderable number of privates by way of compo&s;ition, as the officers of the convention (&s;hould the whole be &s;uffered to be exchanged) would go a great way towards liberating ours at pre&s;ent in the hands of the enemy. But it cannot be expected that they will leave their troops entirely de&s;titute of officers.&mdash;Mr. commi&s;&s;ary Clark, mentioned by &s;ir Henry Clinton, was permitted by general Heath to go from Bo&s;ton to New-York to &s;ettle the accounts and procure money for the di&s;charge of the debts of the troops at Cambridge.&mdash;I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD the honor of receiving your favor of the &s;ixth ye&s;terday, with the inclo&s;ed copy of a letter from the pre&s;ident of the council of New-Jer&s;ey, relative to an expected attack upon the we&s;tern frontier of that &s;tate.&mdash;I have ju&s;t received a letter from general Hand giving intelligence of an attack up|on colonel Alden's regiment at Cherry-Valley, effected by &s;urpri&s;e, in con&s;equence of which, there is too much rea&s;on to apprehend that regiment may fall a &s;acrifice. I tran&s;mit a copy of the di&s;patches announcing this di&s;agreeable affair.</P>
<P>The&s;e depredations of the enemy give me the mo&s;t &s;erious concern. I lament that we have not yet had it in our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to give them an effectual check. I am perfectly convinced that the only certain way of preventing Indian ravages is to carry the war vigorou&s;ly into their own country. But as this is thought impracticable at this late &s;ea&s;on of the year from the &s;tate of the water, and other impediments, I fear we mu&s;t con|tent

Orders are now given to colonel Spencer's regiment and colonel Armand's corps to join general Pula&s;ki.&mdash;This di&s;po&s;ition is agreeable to the opinion of governor Clinton and other gentlemen acquainted with the country whom I have con&s;ulted, and is calculated to cover the ea&s;tern frontier of Penn&s;ylvania, New-Jer&s;ey, and the we&s;tern part of New-York.&mdash;I &s;hall al&s;o immediately &s;end the remainder of general Clinton's brigade to Albany. When ar|rived there, if any thing offen&s;ive can po&s;&s;ibly be undertaken, it &s;hall be done: if not, they will be di&s;po&s;ed of in a manner that &s;hall &s;eem be&s;t adapted for protection and defence.</P>

<P>BY the time this reaches you, general Du Portail will probably be at Philadelphia. One part of his bu&s;ine&s;s is to pro&s;ecute the directions given him &s;ome time &s;ince for forming a plan for the defence of the river Delaware, to be &s;ubmitted to Congre&s;s: another part is to under&s;tand from Congre&s;s what may be their views and wi&s;hes with re&s;pect to his further conti|nuance in America, and that of the three other gentlemen at|tached to him.</P>
<P>He informs me that the furlough he obtained from the court of France expires in February next, and that, unle&s;s there is a certain pro&s;pect of his being employed hereafter in a manner u&s;eful to the &s;tates and honorable to him&s;elf, he intends imme|diately to return. He therefore wi&s;hes &s;ome explicit ideas to be reali&s;ed on the &s;ubject. He is al&s;o anxious that &s;omething definitive &s;hould be done with re&s;pect to the pay and the other appointments both of him&s;elf and the other gentlemen with him, which have been hitherto undecided, and have left them in an uncertain and di&s;agreeable &s;ituation.&mdash;Added to this, he is de&s;irous to have &s;ome arrangement fixed for the rules and manner of &s;ervice in his department.</P>
<P>He delivered me, &s;ome days &s;ince, a memorial intended for Congre&s;s, and which I have now the honor to inclo&s;e, contain|ing his ideas on a general &s;y&s;tem of fortification for the&s;e &s;tates, and which he reque&s;ted me to accompany with my &s;entiments.
<PB N="297" REF="031423_0593_0FEC5F4A27ACE410">
But it includes que&s;tions of finance and con&s;iderations of policy the mo&s;t exten&s;ive and important, of which Congre&s;s alone can form a competent judgment. I &s;hall therefore only &s;ay, that, con&s;idered merely in a military point of view, the plan appears to me worthy of very &s;erious attention.</P>
<P>It is but ju&s;tice to general Du Portail to ob&s;erve that I have a high opinion of his merit and abilities, and e&s;teem him not only well acquainted with the particular branch he profe&s;&s;es, but a man of &s;ound judgment and real knowledge in military &s;cience in general. I have al&s;o a very favorable opinion of the other gentlemen. I will take the liberty to add that it appears to me that it will be extremely nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful in our fu|ture operations, whether directed to offence or defence,&mdash;whe|ther to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s the enemy of po&s;ts in our front, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in carrying on the propo&s;ed expedition into Canada, or any other on a le&s;s exten&s;ive plan which may be &s;ub&s;tituted in its &s;tead for the mere &s;ecurity of our frontier.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur De Murnon has &s;erved in quality of engineer under general Du Portail &s;ince the fir&s;t of March la&s;t, with the pro|mi&s;e of a majority from the committee of arrangement at Val|ley-Forge. He has never yet received his commi&s;&s;ion. This, I pre&s;ume, has been forgotten in a crowd of more important af|fairs.&mdash;With the greate&s;t re&s;pect and e&s;teem, I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</P>

<P>MR. Wheelock will have the honor of pre&s;enting this let|ter to your excellency. He waits on Congre&s;s upon the affairs of a regiment under the command of colonel Bedel, which, it &s;eems, was rai&s;ed in the Coho&s;s county, or at lea&s;t has been
<PB N="298" REF="031423_0594_0FEC60A3C6965720">
kept up &s;ince March la&s;t upon the recommendation of the mar|quis Fayette when at Albany. This corps, according to the inclo&s;ed &s;tate by Mr. Wheelock, who is the lieutenant-colonel, to which I beg leave to refer Congre&s;s, and according to other information I have received, was at fir&s;t a&s;&s;embled under the direction of major-general Gates about this time twelvemonth, for the purpo&s;e of a &s;udden enterpri&s;e again&s;t St. John's, and the enemy's armed ve&s;&s;els lying there, and was engaged till the la&s;t of March.</P>
<P>I cannot undertake to &s;ay in what manner or how u&s;efully this regiment has been employed, or to what extent in point of men. But Mr. Wheelock &s;ays it has been of great &s;ervice: and the object of his pre&s;ent journey is to obtain the direction of Congre&s;s for their being paid when proper rolls are produced, and their determination whether it is to be di&s;banded now, or continued till April next, the period for which the men are &s;aid to have engaged, though the marquis's recommendation extend|ed only to the end of the pre&s;ent campaign.</P>
<P>The regiment may or may not be nece&s;&s;ary in future. Much will depend on the &s;y&s;tem of conduct the enemy pur&s;ue the next campaign, and on our own operations. I would ob&s;erve, under its pre&s;ent engagement, its &s;ervices were to be local, or at lea&s;t confined to a certain quarter. If it &s;hould be deemed expedi|ent to re-enli&s;t it, if practicable it &s;hould be done on the gene|ral &s;cale of acting wherever it may be requi&s;ite (though perhaps it may not be po&s;&s;ible to accompli&s;h it): and, in &s;uch ca&s;e, it will al&s;o be material for the public to have a more perfect know|ledge of its arrangements than what I apprehend it has hither|to had.&mdash;I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</P>

<P>I HAD the honor of your excellency's two favors of the fourteenth and fifteenth in&s;tant, with their &s;everal inclo&s;ures.&mdash;The con&s;ideration of doctor Conolly's ca&s;e, with the re&s;olution of Congre&s;s, I have tran&s;mitted to &s;ir Henry Clinton.</P>
<P>In my letter of the &s;ixteenth I communicated to your excel|lency the attempt on Fort-Alden by the &s;avages.&mdash;I have &s;ince received the inclo&s;ed di&s;patches confirming that di&s;agreeable account.&mdash;I al&s;o informed Congre&s;s at the &s;ame time of the &s;teps which were taken for the &s;ecurity of the frontier of Penn&s;ylva|nia, New-Jer&s;ey, and the we&s;tern part of New-York,&mdash;and that the two remaining regiments of general Clinton's brigade were ordered to Albany.</P>

I have to regret that the condition of affairs is &s;uch as does not admit of a compliance with repeated detachments from this army.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR excellency's letter of the eighteenth, with the in|clo&s;ure referred to, came to hand ye&s;terday.&mdash;I had before re|ceived the intelligence contained in Mr. Deane's letter, and in con&s;equence made part of the detachments which have been mentioned in my late letters. It is highly probable that the
<PB N="300" REF="031423_0596_0FEC60B41DE8A1A8">
late incur&s;ions and outrages were committed by the parties com|prehended in Mr. Deane's intelligence; and I &s;hould hope that the force already gone from the army, together with the &s;ea&s;on, will prevent them at lea&s;t from making further great depreda|tions.</P>
<P>Since I had the honor of addre&s;&s;ing your excellency on the twenty-fir&s;t, I received a letter from general Hand, of the eigh|teenth, an extract from which you will find inclo&s;ed, with copies of a letter from major Whiting and one from a Mr. Clyde.&mdash;The&s;e will inform Congre&s;s, that, though the ravages at Cher|ry-Valley &s;ettlement were great in the late attack by the &s;ava|ges, yet our lo&s;s was much le&s;s than we had rea&s;on to apprehend it from our former advices. The account of the enemy's hav|ing &s;tormed the fort, and cut off Alden's regiment, happily turns out premature. The inclo&s;ure, No. 2, which is a copy of a letter from lord Stirling of the &s;eventeenth, will advi&s;e Congre&s;s that the fleet of tran&s;ports, which had lain at the Hook for &s;ome days before, came up the preceding night to the wa|tering-place, and al&s;o that &s;ome of the &s;hips of war had return|ed to York di&s;ma&s;ted.&mdash;Your excellency will al&s;o &s;ee by the inclo&s;ure, No. 3, (which contains an extract from a letter from general Sullivan, of the eighteenth in&s;tant) the late&s;t advices I have re&s;pecting admiral Biron's fleet.&mdash;From the lo&s;s of the Somer&s;et, and the&s;e &s;everal accounts, they &s;uffered &s;everely in their late crui&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 24.&mdash;I ju&s;t received from general Hand the inclo&s;|ed petition from major Whitcomb, addre&s;&s;ed to Congre&s;s, and his letter to general Hand, of the &s;ame date. My information re&s;pecting the corps under major Whitcomb's command has hi|therto been very imperfect; and even now I do not know the terms on which it was engaged: nor had I, till the&s;e letters came to hand, any rea&s;on to think that the troops above had not all been equally paid, having &s;ent up a &s;upply of money for the purpo&s;e &s;oon after I came to this camp, and authori&s;ed the payma&s;ter-general a few days ago to forward a further quantity.&mdash;I &s;hall immediately write to general Clinton, now on his way to Albany, to &s;end a proper officer to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s;ter the corps, and al|&s;o three companies (which he calls provincials) under his direc|tion, &s;aid to be engaged to the fir&s;t of next month; after which, both will be paid on his pre&s;enting proper rolls.&mdash;With re&s;pect to clothing, the only application I recollect to have had from major Whitcomb was an&s;wered with &s;uch &s;upplies, both in quan|tity and quality, as our &s;tores would admit of. It may perhaps be practicable hereafter to put his corps on a better footing in this in&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="031423_0597_0FEC60B614F6A748">
The alarm which major Whitcomb &s;peaks of in the beginning of his letter to general Hand was occa&s;ioned (as Congre&s;s will perceive by a copy of another letter from him to general Hand) by a de&s;cent made by a body of men in the country about the &s;outh end of lake Champlain, and who, according to his report, have done con&s;iderable damage.</P>
<P>I directed general Portail &s;ome time ago to take a view of the works carrying on in the Highlands for the defence of the North-river, and to make an e&s;timate of the cannon nece&s;&s;ary for the purpo&s;e. This he did: and, as he is now at Philadel|phia, I have written to him by this conveyance, and reque&s;ted him to pre&s;ent the e&s;timate to Congre&s;s. I am &s;orry the num|ber wanted is &s;o great, and the more &s;o as I find upon inquiry that the Sali&s;bury furnace in Connecticut, which u&s;ed to ca&s;t &s;o many, is much out of repair, and could not po&s;&s;ibly be put in order, and in a proper &s;tate for &s;upplies, before May.&mdash;The providing of cannon is a matter of infinite importance; and I am per&s;uaded Congre&s;s will take every means in their power to accompli&s;h it. Be&s;ides the pre&s;&s;ing and exten&s;ive demand for the works on the North-river, we cannot extend our views too &s;oon to the obtaining further large &s;upplies. We mu&s;t in the cour&s;e of things have occa&s;ion for a great deal of artillery: and, in any enterpri&s;e we may undertake again&s;t Canada, whether on a large or &s;mall &s;cale, &s;everal peices of various calibers will be ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential. Be&s;ides arming the &s;hips and ve&s;&s;els we &s;hall be obliged to build to gain the navigation of the lakes, our land operations will require a great number.</P>
<P>A detachment of continental troops will conduct tho&s;e of the convention from the North-river to the Delaware. The Ger|man battalion is to compo&s;e part of the e&s;cort: and, after the convention troops cro&s;s to Penn&s;ylvania, I have directed it, in con&s;equence of the intelligence tran&s;mitted of late by Congre&s;s re&s;pecting the frontiers, to proceed to Ea&s;ton with all its bag|gage, where it is to wait till general Hand arrives at the Mini|&s;inks, and whence it will be ready to act as circum&s;tances may require. At the &s;ame time, if the&s;e frequent detachments from the army could be avoided, it were much to be wi&s;hed. The troops will be by this means in a very di&s;per&s;ed &s;tate; and, be|&s;ides lo&s;ing perhaps &s;ome advantages which might pre&s;ent them|&s;elves if they were more collected, their di&s;cipline will be great|ly injured, and it will be extremely difficult, from a variety of cau&s;es, to draw them together again: and, if it &s;hould be prac|ticable, it is highly probable we &s;hall find their number much impaired by de&s;ertion and otherwi&s;e.</P>

<P>MR. John Dodge will have the honor of delivering this letter to your excellency. His hi&s;tory is that he is a native of Connecticut, and about eight years ago, as he informs me, &s;et|tled in the country between Detroit and Pitt&s;burg as an Indian trader;&mdash;that he carried on commerce till January 1776, when, for his attachment to our cau&s;e and the mea&s;ures he had taken to promote it, be became obnoxious to the enemy, was &s;eized by order of the governor of Detroit, was thrown into pri&s;on, and there continued till the beginning of May la&s;t, when he was &s;ent to Quebec;&mdash;that on the ninth of October he e&s;caped from thence and got into our &s;ettlements, through the aid of a French Caghnewaga who came with him here on friday la&s;t.</P>
<P>I find Mr. Dodge an intelligent young man, intimately ac|quainted with all the tract of country between Pitt&s;burg and Detroit, and with that lying on Lake Erie, al&s;o with mo&s;t of the &s;avage tribes in tho&s;e parts, and with their languages. He is likewi&s;e well acquainted with the communication from Fort-Stanwix to O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">wego and Niagara.</P>
<P>I believe Mr. Dodge's hi&s;tory to be true; and, from a vari|ety of circum&s;tances, I am per&s;uaded of his firm attachment to us: and I would take the liberty to &s;ugge&s;t to Congre&s;s that I think he may be of very important &s;ervice to us in any enter|pri&s;e we may undertake in the we&s;tern quarter, or again&s;t the force on Lake Erie or Lake Ontario. This con&s;ideration, with that of his lo&s;&s;es and &s;ufferings which I am inclined to believe have been con&s;iderable, &s;eems to make him worthy of notice and attention.&mdash;His information is good and clear in &s;everal points which I know my&s;elf, and in many others (from the manner in which he delivered it) far &s;uperior and much more &s;atisfactory than what I have been able to derive from any other per&s;on.&mdash;As I have ob&s;erved before, Mr. Dodge appears to me a valuable intelligencer; and, if Congre&s;s are plea&s;ed to honor him with an opportunity, he will give them an account of the po&s;ts of Detroit and Niagara when he left them, and of that at Michilimachinac,&mdash;of the enemy's naval force on Lakes Erie and Ontario, and of &s;uch other matters in Canada as he was a|ble to inform him&s;elf of, either by his own ob&s;ervation or the relation of others.</P>
<P>General Gates &s;upplied Mr. Dodge with &s;ome money to de|fray his expen&s;es from Bo&s;ton to this place, and I have advanc|ed him to-day a hundred and fifty dollars more to carry him to Philadelphia.&mdash;I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</P>

<P>I have the plea&s;ure to inform Congre&s;s that the whole army (one brigade and the light corps excepted) is now in motion to the places of their re&s;pective cantonments for winter-quar|ters.

When their pa&s;&s;age is completed, the remaining troops kept in the field will immediately retire to quarters.</P>
<P>The di&s;po&s;ition for winter-quarters is as follows:&mdash;Nine bri|gades will be &s;tationed on the we&s;t &s;ide of Hud&s;on's river ex|clu&s;ive of the garri&s;on at We&s;t-Point,&mdash;one of which (the North-Carolina brigade) will be near Smith's Clove for the &s;ecurity of that pa&s;s, and as a reinforcement to We&s;t-Point in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity; another (the Jer&s;ey brigade) will be at Eli|zabethtown, to cover the lower part of Jer&s;ey; and the other &s;even, con&s;i&s;ting of the Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and Penn&s;ylvania troops, will be at Middlebrook.&mdash;Six brigades will be left on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the river and at We&s;t-Point;&mdash;three of which (of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts troops) will be &s;tationed for the immediate defence of the Highlands; one at We&s;t-Point in ad|dition to the garri&s;on already there; and the other two at Fi&s;h|kill and the Continental Village.&mdash;The remaining three bri|gades, compo&s;ed of the New-Hamp&s;hire and Connecticut troops, and Hazen's regiment, will be po&s;ted in the vicinity of Dan|bury, for the protection of the country lying along the Sound,
<PB N="304" REF="031423_0600_0FEC60C7438EF708">
to cover our magazines lying on Connecticut-river, and to aid the Highlands on any &s;erious movement of the enemy that way.&mdash;The park of artillery will be at Pluckenim.&mdash;The ca|valry will be di&s;po&s;ed of thus:&mdash;Bland's regiment at Winche&s;|ter in Virginia, Baylor's at Frederic or Hagar&s;town in Mary|land, Moylan's at Lanca&s;ter in Penn&s;ylvania, and Sheldon's at Durham in Connecticut. Lee's corps will be with that part of the army which is in the Jer&s;eys acting on the advanced po&s;ts.&mdash;This comprehends the general di&s;tribution of the army, except Clinton's brigade of New-York troops, Pula&s;ki's corps, and &s;ome detached regiments and corps &s;tationed at Albany and at different parts of the frontier, of which Congre&s;s have already been particularly advi&s;ed.&mdash;General Putnam will com|mand at Danbury, General M'Dougal in the Highlands, and my own quarters will be in the Jer&s;eys, in the neighborhood of Middlebrook.</P>
<P>This di&s;po&s;ition appeared to me be&s;t calculated to conciliate as far as po&s;&s;ible the&s;e &s;everal objects,&mdash;the protection of the country, the &s;ecurity of the important po&s;ts in the Highlands, the &s;afety, di&s;cipline, and ea&s;y &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the army.&mdash;To have kept the troops in a collected &s;tate would have increa&s;ed infinitely the expen&s;e and difficulty of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting them, both with re&s;pect to forage and provi&s;ions: to have divided them into &s;maller cantonments would have made it far le&s;s practica|ble to maintain order and di&s;cipline among them, and would have put them le&s;s in a condition to control and prevent offen|&s;ive operations on the &s;ide of the enemy, or to a&s;&s;emble to take advantage of any favorable opening which their future &s;ituation may offer, &s;hould they be obliged to weaken them&s;elves by further detachments &s;o far as to invite an enterpri&s;e again&s;t them.</P>
<P>By the e&s;timate of the quarter-ma&s;ter and commi&s;&s;ary-gene|ral, it appears indi&s;pen&s;able to have the principal part of the army on the other &s;ide of the North-river. It was thought impracticable to furni&s;h the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies of flour for the whole, on this &s;ide the river, from the immen&s;e difficulty and expen&s;e of tran&s;portation in the winter &s;ea&s;on, and from the ex|hau&s;ted &s;tate of the country with re&s;pect to forage.&mdash;As this &s;ubject has been already fully before Congre&s;s, I &s;hall not trou|ble them with a repetition of the detail.&mdash;In order as much as po&s;&s;ible to reduce the demand of forage and facilitate the &s;upplies, I have given directions, when the &s;everal divi&s;ions ar|rive at their cantonments, to &s;end away to convenient places at a di&s;tance from them all the hor&s;es not ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite to carry on the ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s of the army.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="031423_0601_0FEC6098EF259098">
It is unnece&s;&s;ary to add that the troops mu&s;t again have re|cour&s;e to the expedient of hutting as they did la&s;t year.

<P>BETWEEN Frederic&s;burg and this place where I arri|ved ye&s;terday afternoon, I had the honor to receive your ex|cellency's &s;everal favors of the twenty-&s;ixth, twenty-&s;eventh, and twenty-eighth, in due order, with their &s;everal inclo&s;ures, which &s;hall have my attention. My being on the road from the time of their coming to hand till ye&s;terday prevented me from acknowledging them before.</P>
<P>As many inconveniences would attend the removing of the &s;ick officers and men of the convention troops by land, and the officers having families, I have written to general Gates to per|mit them to proceed to the falls of James'-river by water, on the officers' giving their paroles that they and the men will perform the voyage. I have al&s;o acquainted him of the meet|ing in contemplation for an exchange of pri&s;oners, that the offi|cers may not leave Bo&s;ton till the re&s;ult is known.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to major De Pa&s;&s;ern of the regiment of He&s;&s;e-Hanau, I hope he may be relea&s;ed by an exchange; after which, it will remain with him to obtain liberty from &s;ir Henry Clinton to return to Europe. But if the exchange in agitation &s;hould not take place, I &s;hould be happy if Congre&s;s them&s;elves would decide whether he is to be allowed his reque&s;t.&mdash;If on my per|mi&s;&s;ion he &s;hould go to Europe without application to and the con&s;ent of the Briti&s;h commander (which &s;eems to be his inten|tion), the enemy might not think them&s;elves bound upon a fu|ture occa&s;ion to account for him.</P>

<P>I HAVE the honor to addre&s;s you by command of his excellency, who went from this place at four o'clock this morn|ing in con&s;equence of advice received la&s;t night that fifty-two ve&s;&s;els great and &s;mall, including a bomb-ketch, with troops on board, had the day before ye&s;terday, moved up the North-river

as far as Cloy&s;ter-landing, and ye&s;terday morning got under way and were proceeding farther up. He propo&s;ed to make his fir&s;t &s;tage at Acquakenunk, and to proceed as his future intelligence might require. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> much at a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> determine the de&s;ign of the enemy, but thinks it may either have re&s;pect to the forts in the Highlands or to the convention troops.</P>
<P>When he left Peek&s;kill, the two Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts brigades, on their march thither from Hartford, were not arrived, &s;o that the troops on the &s;pot were only the original garri&s;on of We&s;t-Point, and Nixon's brigade which lay near the Continental Village: but, without the mo&s;t inexplicable delay, tho&s;e mu&s;t have reach|ed their de&s;tination &s;ome days &s;ince. If &s;o, and the enemy &s;hould meditate a &s;troke again&s;t We&s;t-Point, they will probably fail in it unle&s;s there &s;hould be &s;omething like a &s;urpri&s;e.&mdash;The general al&s;o thinks it probable that the Maryland divi&s;ion were ye&s;terday evening at the Clove. Their in&s;tructions were, to communicate with We&s;t-Point and reinforce it on any emergency. They were, in addition to them, directed la&s;t night by expre&s;s to move immediately towards the forts, dive&s;ted of baggage and artillery, for the more &s;peedy communication.&mdash;The Carolina brigade has been &s;ome time &s;tationed at the entrance of the Clove.</P>
<P>One brigade of the Virginia troops is at Pompton, and the other two were expected to reach Springfield ye&s;terday. The Penn&s;ylvania troops, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, would be at Acquakenunk or in the neighborhood of Paramus.&mdash;The&s;e troops, immedi|ately on receiving the pre&s;ent intelligence, were ordered to halt; and his excellency is gone forward to regulate their movements according to circum&s;tances.&mdash;The brigade in this town is order|ed to hold it&s;elf in readine&s;s.</P>
<P>If the convention troops &s;hould be their object, 'tis probable the attempt will be too late to an&s;wer any purpo&s;e: the rear di|vi&s;ion was to cro&s;s the North-river on wedne&s;day la&s;t, but mu&s;t certainly have done it on thur&s;day; the front mu&s;t be not far from the Delaware; and the whole too far advanced to be &s;ub|ject to a ri&s;que. Added to this, there is a pretty &s;trong guard with each divi&s;ion. His excellency however has &s;ent on the in|telligence to colonel Bland who directs their march, urging him to ha&s;ten them forward with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch.</P>
<P>One brigade of Connecticut troops was at Danbury, the other at Frederic&s;burg, when we came away; and general Poor's was in full march for the former, and mu&s;t long &s;ince have arrived.</P>

<P>Upon leaving Elizabethtown I directed colonel Harri&s;on to inform you of the intelligence I had received, and which I thought demanded my per&s;onal attention, as the enemy appear|ed to be going up the river in con&s;iderable force. Having put the troops de&s;tined for the Middlebrook cantonment upon their march back towards the North-river, I was proceeding that way my&s;elf when an expre&s;s met me a few miles from this, informing me that the enemy's &s;hipping, which had been as high as King's ferry, had fallen down again. They landed a party at the fer|ry, and &s;et fire to a few &s;mall buildings near the water: but, upon a party of ours advancing, they immediately [<HI>re-embarked.</HI>] without attempting any thing further.&mdash;The boats and &s;tores of every kind had been previou&s;ly &s;ecured&mdash;I cannot account for this manoenvre but by &s;uppo&s;ing that they had been mi&s;informed as to the quantity of &s;tores at the ferry, or that they expected to find the po&s;ts in a defencele&s;s &s;ituation; or it may perhaps have been to favor a forage below.</P>
<P>Finding that the troops de&s;tined for the defence of the High|lands had arrived at their re&s;pective po&s;ts agreeable to my or|ders and expectations, I have again put tho&s;e intended for Mid|dlebrook into motion; and I hope they will arrive there while the roads and weather are both fine.</P>
<P>Accounts from New-York through a good channel inform me that thirty thou&s;and tons of &s;hipping had been &s;uddenly tak|en up for government &s;ervice, and that a general embargo is laid. The occa&s;ion has not yet tran&s;pired; at lea&s;t it has not yet reached me.&mdash;</P>

<P>IT has not been in my power to return an an&s;wer to your favor of the &s;ixth in&s;tant till now. The letter met me on the road, &s;eparated from my papers; and I did not reach this place till late on the eleventh, &s;ince which I have been much employ|ed in attending to the di&s;po&s;itions for hutting the army: but in the mean time the objects of the di&s;patch have engaged my ut|mo&s;t attention.</P>
<P>The earne&s;t de&s;ire I have to pay the &s;tricte&s;t compliance in every in&s;tance with the views and in&s;tructions of Congre&s;s can|not but make me feel the greate&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s when I find my|&s;elf in circum&s;tances of he&s;itation or doubt with re&s;pect to their directions. But the perfect confidence I have in the ju&s;tice and candor of that honorable body emboldens me to communicate without re&s;erve the difficulties which occur in the execution of their pre&s;ent order; and the indulgence I have experienced on every former occa&s;ion induces me to imagine that the liberty I now take will not meet with their di&s;approbation.</P>
<P>I have attentively taken up the report of the committee of the fifth (approved by Congre&s;s) on the &s;ubject of my letter of the eleventh ultimo on the propo&s;ed expedition into Canada: I have con&s;idered it in &s;everal lights, and &s;incerely regret that I &s;hould feel my&s;elf under any embarra&s;&s;ment in carrying it into execution. Still I remain of opinion, from a general review of things and the &s;tate of our re&s;ources, that no exten&s;ive &s;y&s;tem of co-operation with the French, for the complete emancipation of Canada, can be po&s;itively decided on for the en&s;uing year.&mdash;To propo&s;e a plan of perfect co-operation with a foreign power with|out a moral certainty in our &s;upplies, and to have that plan ac|tually ratified with the court of Ver&s;ailles, might be attended, in ca&s;e of failure in the conditions on our part, with very fatal effects.</P>
<P>If I &s;hould &s;eem unwilling to tran&s;mit the plan as prepared by Congre&s;s, with my ob&s;ervations, it is becau&s;e I find my&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity (in order to give our mini&s;ter &s;ufficient ground to found an application on) to propo&s;e &s;omething more than a vague and indeci&s;ive plan, which, even in the event of a total evacuation of the&s;e &s;tates by the enemy, may be rendered im|practicable in the execution by a variety of in&s;urmountable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> or if I retain my pre&s;ent &s;entiments and act con&s;i&s;tently.
<PB N="309" REF="031423_0605_0FEC60A185E7BBE8">
I mu&s;t point out the difficulties as they appear to me; which mu&s;t embarra&s;s his negotiations, and may di&s;appoint the views of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>But proceeding on the idea of the enemy's leaving the&s;e &s;tates before the active part of the en&s;uing campaign, I &s;hould fear to hazard a mi&s;take as to the preci&s;e aim and extent of the views of Congre&s;s. The line of conduct that I am to ob&s;erve in writing to our mini&s;ter at the court of France does not ap|pear &s;ufficiently delineated:&mdash;were I to undertake it, I &s;hould be much afraid of erring through mi&s;conception. In this di|lemma I would e&s;teem it a particular favor to be excu&s;ed from writing at all on the &s;ubject, e&s;pecially as it is the part of can|dor in me to acknowledge that I do not &s;ee my way clear e|nough to point out &s;uch a plan for co-operation as I conceive to be con&s;i&s;tent with the ideas of Congre&s;s, and that will be &s;uffi|ciently explanatory with re&s;pect to time and circum&s;tances, to give efficacy to the mea&s;ure. But if congre&s;s &s;till think it ne|ce&s;&s;ary for me to proceed in the bu&s;ine&s;s, I mu&s;t reque&s;t their more definitive and explicit in&s;tructions, and that they will per|mit me, previous to tran&s;mitting the intended di&s;patches, to &s;ub|mit them to their determination.</P>
<P>I could wi&s;h to lay before Congre&s;s more minutely the &s;tate of the army, the condition of our &s;upplies, and the requi&s;ites ne|ce&s;&s;ary for carrying into execution an undertaking that may in|volve the mo&s;t &s;erious events. If Congre&s;s think this can be done more &s;atisfactorily in a per&s;onal conference, I hope to have the army in &s;uch a &s;ituation before I can receive their an&s;wer, as to afford me an opportunity of giving my attendance.&mdash;I would on|ly add that I &s;hall cheerfully comply with the directions of Con|gre&s;s relative to making every preparation in our power for an expedition again&s;t Niagara, and for &s;uch further operations to the northward as time and circum&s;tances &s;hall enable us to carry on. Mea&s;ures for the purpo&s;e have been taken in part for &s;ome time pa&s;t; and I &s;hall pur&s;ue them vigorou&s;ly. The &s;ubject has long engaged my contemplation; and I am thoroughly convinc|ed of the expediency and policy of doing every thing practica|ble on our part, for giving &s;ecurity to our frontiers by the re|duction of tho&s;e places which facilitate annoying them, and even for accompli&s;hing the annexation of Canada to the Union.&mdash;</P>

<P>I do not conceive that Congre&s;s &s;hould reque&s;t a renewal of colonel Fleury's furlough from the French mini&s;ter plenipoten|tiary.

<P>I HAD the honor of addre&s;&s;ing Congre&s;s &s;ome time &s;ince on the &s;ubject of general Du Portail and the gentlemen with him. He informs me that his affair has not yet been decided, and is extremely anxious that it &s;hould be in &s;ome way or o|ther. He a&s;&s;igns many powerful rea&s;ons to &s;hew that it is very intere&s;ting to him (if he is not to continue in our &s;ervice) to return to France as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible. He al&s;o informs me that he has rea&s;on to think, in the con&s;ideration of his affair, the retaining him in &s;ervice and the adopting the plan propo&s;|ed in his memoir are united, and the deci&s;ion of the one &s;u&s;|pended on that of the other; and has therefore reque&s;ted me to repre&s;ent to Congre&s;s that he &s;hould be happy they could be con&s;idered &s;eparately; and if his &s;ervices, ab&s;tractedly from the project propo&s;ed by him, are deemed nece&s;&s;ary, it will be agree|able to him to remain in the country.</P>
