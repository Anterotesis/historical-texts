<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;lavery of the Negroes having, of late, drawn the attention of many &s;erious minded people; &s;everal tracts have been publi&s;hed &s;etting forth its incon&s;i&s;|tancy with every chri&s;tian and mo|ral virtue, which its hoped will have weight with the judicious; e&s;pecially at a time when the liber|ties of mankind are become &s;o much the &s;ubject of general atten|tion. For the &s;atisfaction of the &s;erious enquirer who may not have the opportunity of &s;eeing tho&s;e tracts, and &s;uch others who are &s;incerely de&s;irous that the iniquity of this practice may become effec|tually apparent, to tho&s;e in who&s;e

And here it will not be improper to premi&s;e, that

tho' wars ari&s;ing from the common depravity of human nature, have happened, as well among the Ne|groes as other nations and the weak &s;ometimes been made captives to the &s;trong; yet nothing ap|pears, in the various relations of the intercour&s;e and trade, for a long time, carried on by the Eu|ropeans, on that coa&s;t, which would induce us to believe, that there is any real foundation for that argument, &s;o commonly ad|vanced, in vindication of that trade viz. <Q><HI>That the &s;lavery of the Ne|groes took its ri&s;e from a de&s;ire, in the purcha&s;ers, to &s;ave the lives of &s;uch of them as were taken cap|tives in war, who would otherwi&s;e have been &s;acrificed to the impla|cable revenge of their conquerors.</HI></Q>

A plea which when compared with the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e times, will ap|pear to be de&s;titute of Truth; and to have been advanced, and urged, principally by &s;uch as were concerned in reaping the gain of this infamous traffic, as a paliation of that, again&s;t which their own rea&s;on and con&s;cience, mu&s;t have rai&s;ed fearful objections.</P>

and too ea&s;y credit is given to the accounts we frequently hear or read of their barba|rous and &s;avage way of living in their own country; we &s;hall be naturally induced to look upon them as incapable of improve|ment, de&s;titute, mi&s;erable, and in&s;en&s;ible of the benefits of life; and that our permitting them to live among&s;t us, even on the mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive terms, is to them a favour; but on impartial enquiry, the ca&s;e will appear to be far otherwi&s;e; we &s;hall find that there is &s;carce a country in the whole world, that is better calculated for affording the nece&s;&s;ary comforts of life to its inhabitants, with le&s;s &s;olicitude and toil, than Guinea. And that notwith&s;tanding the long conver&s;e of many of its inhabitants with (often) the wor&s;t of the Europeans, they &s;till retain a great deal of innocent &s;implicity; and when not &s;tirred up to revenge from the frequent abu&s;es they have received from the Europeans in general; manife&s;t them&s;elves to be a humane, &s;ociable people, who&s;e faculties are as capable of im|provement as tho&s;e of other people; and that their oeconomy and government is, in many re&s;pects, commendable. Hence it ap|pears they might have lived happy, if not di&s;turbed by the Europeans; more e&s;pecially, if the&s;e la&s;t had u&s;ed &s;uch endeavours as their chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion requires, to communicate to the ignorant Africans that &s;uperior

knowledge which providence had favoured them with. In order to &s;et this matter in its true light, and for the information of tho&s;e well minded people who are de&s;irous of being fully acquainted with the merits of a cau&s;e, which is of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence; as therein the lives and happine&s;s of thou|&s;ands and hundreds of thou&s;ands of our fel|low men have fallen, and are daily falling a &s;acrifice to &s;elfi&s;h avarice, and u&s;urped pow|er, I will here give &s;ome account of the &s;e|veral divi&s;ions of tho&s;e parts of Africa, from whence the Negroes are brought, with a &s;ummary of their produce; the di&s;po&s;ition of their re&s;pective inhabitants; their im|provements, &amp;c &amp;c, extracted from authors of credit; mo&s;tly &s;uch as have been principal officers in the Engli&s;h, French and Dutch factories, and who re&s;ided many years in tho&s;e countries. But fir&s;t it is nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e, as a remark generally applicable to the whole coa&s;t of Guinea, <Q><HI>That the Al|mighty who has determined and appointed the bounds of the habitation of men on the face of the earth,</HI></Q> in the manner that is mo&s;t con|ducive to the well being of their different natures and di&s;po&s;itions has &s;o ordered it that altho' Guinea is extreamly unhealthy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Gentleman's Magazine, Supplement,</HI> 1763. <HI>Extract of a letter wrote from the i&s;land of Senegal by Mr. Boone practitioner of phy&s;ic there, to Dr. Brockle&s;by of London.</HI></P><P><Q>To form a ju&s;t idea of the unhealthine&s;s of the cli|mate, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to conceive a country extend|ing three hundred leagues ea&s;t, and more to the north and &s;outh. Thro' this country &s;everal large rivers empty them&s;elves into the &s;ea; particular|ly the Sanaga, Gambia and Sherbro; the&s;e du|ring the rainy months, which begin in July, and continue till October, overflow their banks and lay the whole flat country under water; and indeed, the very &s;udden ri&s;e of the&s;e rivers is incredible, to per&s;ons who have never been within the tropicks and are unacquainted with the violent rains that fall there. At Galem, nine hundred miles from the mouth of the Sanaga, I am informed that the waters ri&s;e one hundred and fifty feet perpendicular from the bed of the river. This information I re|ceived from a gentleman, who was &s;urgeon's mate to a party &s;ent there, and the only &s;urvivor of three captains command, each con&s;i&s;ting of one captain, two lieutenants, one en&s;ign, a &s;urgeon's mate, three &s;erjeants, three corporals and fifty privates.</Q></P><P><Q>When the rains are at an end which u&s;ually happens in October, the inten&s;e heat of the Sun &s;oon dries up the waters, which lie on the higher parts of the earth, and the remainder forms lakes of &s;tagnated waters, in which are found all &s;orts of dead animals: The&s;e waters every day decrea&s;e till at la&s;t they are quite exhaled and then the ef|fluvia that ari&s;es is almo&s;t in&s;upportable. At this &s;ea&s;on, the winds blow &s;o very hot from off the land, that I can compare them to nothing but the heat proceeding from the mouth of an oven. This occa&s;ions the Europeans to be &s;orely vexed with bi|lious and putrid lovers. From this account you will not be &s;urprized, that the total lo&s;s of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects in this i&s;land only, amounted to above two thou&s;and fivehundred in the &s;pace of three years that I was there, in &s;uch a putrid moi&s;t air as I have de&s;cribed.</Q></P></NOTE>

The ancient inhabi|tants of Morrocco who wore coats of mail, and u&s;ed &s;words and &s;pears headed with iron, coming among&s;t the&s;e harmle&s;s and naked people, &s;oon brought them under &s;ubjection, and divided that part of Guinea which lies on the rivers Senegal and Gam|bia into fifteen parts; tho&s;e were the fif|teen kingdoms of the Negroes, over which the Moors pre&s;ided and the common peo|ple were Negroes. The&s;e Moors taught the Negroes the mahometan religion and arts of life; particularly the u&s;e of iron, be|fore unknown to them: About the 14th, century, a native Negro called Heli I&s;chia, expelled the Moori&s;h conquerors; but tho'

the Negroes threw off the yoke of a foreign nation, they only changed a Libyan for a Ne|groe ma&s;ter. Heli I&s;chia him&s;elf becoming king, led the Negroes on to foreign wars and e&s;tabli&s;hed him&s;elf in power over a very large extent of country.</Q> Since Leo's time, the Europeans have had very little knowledge of tho&s;e parts of Africa; nor do they know what became of his great empire. It is highly proba|ble that it broke into pieces, and that the na|tives again re&s;umed many of their ancient cu&s;toms; for in the account publi&s;hed by William Moor, in his travels on the river Gambia, we find a mixture of the Moori&s;h and mahometan cu&s;toms, joined with the original &s;implicity of the Negroes. It ap|pears by accounts of ancient voyages, col|lected by Hackluit, Purcha&s;e and others, that it was about fifty years before the di&s;|covery of America, that the Portugue&s;e at|tempted to &s;ail round cape Bojador which lays between their country and Guinea; this af|ter divers repul&s;es, occa&s;ioned by the violent currents, they effected; when landing on the we&s;tern coa&s;ts of Africa they &s;oon began to make incur&s;ions into the country and to &s;eize and carry off the native inhabitants. As early as the year 1434, Alonzo Gonzales, the fir&s;t who is recorded to have met with the natives, being on that coa&s;t, pur&s;ued

and attacked a number of them, when &s;ome were wounded, as was al&s;o one of the Por|tugue&s;e, which the author records, as the fir&s;t blood &s;pilt by chri&s;tians in tho&s;e parts. Six years after, the &s;ame Gonzales again at|tacked the natives, and took twelve pri&s;on|ers; with whom he returned to his ve&s;|&s;els; he afterwards put a woman on &s;hore, in order to induce the natives to redeem the pri&s;oners; but the next day 150 of the in|habitants appeared on hor&s;es and camels, provoking the Portugue&s;e to land, which they not daring to venture, the natives di&s;|charged a volley of &s;tones at them, and went off. After this the Portugue&s;e &s;till continued to &s;end ve&s;&s;els on the coa&s;t of A|frica, particularly we read of their falling on a village, whence the inhabitants fled and being pur&s;ued, 25 were taken. <Q><HI>He that ran be&s;t, &s;ays the author, taking the mo&s;t:</HI> in their way home they killed &s;ome of the natives, and took fifty-five more pri|&s;oners.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Collection, vol. 1, page 13.</NOTE> Afterwards Dini&s;anes Dagra|ma, with two other ve&s;&s;els landed on the i&s;land Arguin, where they took 54 Moors; then running along the coa&s;t 80 leagues farther they at &s;everal times took 50 &s;laves; but here &s;even of the Portugue&s;e were kill|ed. Then being joined by &s;everal other ve&s;|&s;els, Dini&s;anes propo&s;ed to de&s;troy the

<P>From the foregoing accounts it is un|doubted that the practice of making &s;laves of the Negroes, owes it origin to the early incur&s;ions of the Portugue&s;e on the coa&s;t of Africa, &s;olely from an inordinate de&s;ire of gain; this is clearly evidenced from their own hi&s;torians, particularly <HI>Cada Mo&s;to</HI> a|bout the year 1455, who writes, <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Collection, vol. 1. page, 576.</NOTE> That before the trade was &s;ettled for purcha&s;|ing &s;laves from the Moors at Arguin, &s;ometimes four, and &s;ometimes more Por|tugue&s;e ve&s;&s;els, were u&s;ed to come to that gulf, well armed, and landing by night would &s;urpri&s;e &s;ome fi&s;hermen's villages; that they even entered into the country and carried off Arabs of both &s;exes, whom they &s;old in Portugal.

After long &s;olicitation and innu|merable repul&s;es, he obtained leave to lay the matter before the Emperor Charles the fifth, then King of Spain. As the con|tents of the &s;peech he made before the King in council, are very applicable to the ca&s;e of the en&s;laved Africans, and a lively evidence that the &s;pirit of true piety &s;peaks the &s;ame language in the hearts of faithful men, in all ages, for the relief of their fellow crea|tures, from oppre&s;&s;ion of every kind, I think it may not be improper, here to tran&s;cribe the mo&s;t intere&s;ting parts of it. <Q>I was, &s;ays this pious bi&s;hop, one of the fir&s;t who went to America; neither curio&s;ity, nor intere&s;t prompted me to undertake &s;o long and dangerous a voyage, the &s;aving the &s;ouls of the heathen was my &s;ole ob|ject.

<P>WE are told by Griffith Hughes, rec|tor of St. Lucy in Barbadoes, in his natural hi&s;tory of that i&s;land, printed in the year 1750, <Q>That there was between &s;ixty five and &s;eventy thou&s;and Negroes, at that time, in the i&s;land, tho' formerly they had a greater number: That in or|der to keep up a nece&s;&s;ary number, they were obliged to have a yearly &s;upply from Africa: That the hard labour, and often
<PB N="86" REF="011985_0094_0F87EE41DA1D0F00">
want of nece&s;&s;aries, which the&s;e unhappy creatures are obliged to undergo, de&s;troy a greater number than are bred there.</Q> He adds, <Q>That the capacities of their minds in common affairs of life are but little in|ferior, if at all, to tho&s;e of the Europeans. If they fail in &s;ome arts, he &s;ays, it may be owing more to their want of education and the depre&s;&s;ion of their &s;pirits by &s;la|very, than to any want of natural abili|ties.</Q> This de&s;truction of the human &s;pecies, thro' unnatural hard&s;hips, and want of nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies, in the ca&s;e of the Ne|groes is farther confirmed in <HI>an account of the European &s;ettlements in America,</HI> printed London, 1757, where it is &s;aid, par. 6. chap. 11th. <Q>The Negroes in our colonies en|dure a &s;lavery more compleat, and attend|ed with far wor&s;e circum&s;tances, than what any people in their condition &s;uffer in any other part of the world or have &s;uffered in any other period of time: Proofs of this are not wanting. The prodigious wa&s;te which we experience in this unhappy part of our &s;pecies, is a full and melancholy evidence of this truth. The i&s;land of Barbadoes (the Ne|groes upon which do not amount to eigh|ty thou&s;and) notwith&s;tanding all the means which they u&s;e to encrea&s;e them, by propagation, and that the climate is
<PB N="87" REF="011985_0095_0F87EE429A22C3F0">
in every re&s;pect (expect that of being more whole&s;ome) exactly re&s;embling the climate from whence they come; not|with&s;tanding all this, Barbadoes lies under a nece&s;&s;ity of an annual recruit of five thou&s;and &s;laves, to keep up the &s;tock at the number I have mentioned. This pro|digious failure, which is at lea&s;t in the &s;ame proportion in all our i&s;lands, &s;hews demon&s;tratively that &s;ome uncommon and un&s;upportable hard&s;hip lies upon the Ne|groes, which wears them down in &s;uch a &s;urpri&s;ing manner.</Q></P>
<P>In an account of part of North America, publi&s;hed by Thomas Jeffery 1761, the au|thor &s;peaking of the u&s;age the Negroes re|ceive in the We&s;t India i&s;lands, &s;ays, <Q>It is impo&s;&s;ible for a human heart to reflect up|on the &s;ervitude of the&s;e dregs of man|kind, without in &s;ome mea&s;ure feeling for their mi&s;ery, which ends but with their lives.&mdash;Nothing can be more wretched than the condition of this people. One would imagine, they were framed to be the di&s;grace of the human &s;pecies, bani&s;h|ed from their country, and deprived of that ble&s;&s;ing liberty, on which all other nations &s;et the greate&s;t value; they are in a mea&s;ure reduced to the condition of bea&s;ts of burden. In general a few roots, potatoes e&s;pecially, are their food, and

They whip them mo&s;t unmercifully on &s;mall occa&s;ions: you will &s;ee their bodies all whaled and &s;carred; in &s;hort, they &s;eem to &s;et no other value on their lives, than as they co&s;t them &s;o much money, and are re&s;trained from killing them, when angry, by no worthier con&s;ideration, than that they lo&s;e &s;o much. They act as though they did not look upon them as a race of hu|man creatures, who have rea&s;on, and re|membrance of misfortunes; but as bea&s;ts, like oxen, who are &s;tubborn, hardy and &s;en&s;ele&s;s; fit for burdens and de&s;igned to bear them: they wont allow them to have any claim to human privileges, or &s;carce indeed, to be regarded as the work of God.

This with a few herrings, or other &s;alt fi&s;h, is what is given for their &s;upport. Their allowance for cloathing in the i&s;land is &s;eldom more than &s;ix yards of oznabrigs each year. And in the more northern colonies, where the piercing we&s;t|erly winds are long and &s;en&s;ibly felt, the&s;e poor Africans &s;uffer much for want of &s;uffi|cient cloathing, indeed &s;ome have none till they are able to pay for it by their labour. The time that the Negroes work in the We&s;t Indies, is from day break till noon; then again from two o'clock till dark, (dur|ing which time they are attended by over|&s;eers who &s;everely &s;courge tho&s;e who appear to them dilatory,) and before they are &s;uf|fered
<PB N="91" REF="011985_0099_0F87EE6D5A395160">
to go to their quarters, they have &s;till &s;omething to do, as collecting herbage for the hor&s;es, gathering fewel for the boilers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;o that it is often pa&s;t twelve before they can get home; when they have &s;carce time to grind and boil their Indian corn: whereby if their food was not prepared the evening before, it &s;ometimes happens, that they are called again to labour before they can &s;atisfy their hunger. And here no delay or excu&s;e will avail, for if they are not in the field immediately upon the u&s;ual notice, they mu&s;t expect to feel the over&s;eers la&s;h. In crop time (which la&s;ts many months,) they are obliged (by turns,) to work mo&s;t of the night, in the boiling hou&s;e. Thus their owners from a de&s;ire of making the greate&s;t gain by the labour of their &s;laves, lay heavy burdens on them, and yet feed and cloath them very &s;paringly, and &s;ome &s;carce feed or cloath them at all; &s;o that the poor creatures are obliged to &s;hift for their living in the be&s;t manner they can; which occa&s;ions their being often killed in the neighbouring lands, &s;tealing potatoes or other food, to &s;atisfy their hunger. And if they take any thing from the plantation they belong to, though under &s;uch pre&s;&s;ing want, their owners will correct them &s;everely, for taking a little of what they have &s;o hardly laboured for; whil&s;t many of them&s;elves riot in the greate&s;t

luxury and exce&s;s. It is a matter of a&s;to|ni&s;hment how a people who, as a nation, are looked upon as generous and humane, and &s;o much value them&s;elves for their uncom|mon &s;en&s;e of the benefit of liberty, can live in the practice of &s;uch extreme oppre&s;&s;ion and inhumanity, without &s;eeing the incon|&s;i&s;tency of &s;uch conduct, and feeling great remor&s;e. Nor is it le&s;s amazing to hear the&s;e men calmly making caculations about the &s;trength and lives of their fellow men; in Jamaica if &s;ix in ten, of the new imported Negroes &s;urvive the &s;ea&s;oning, it is looked upon as a gaining purcha&s;e. And in mo&s;t of the other plantations, if the negroes live eight or nine years, their labour is reckoned a &s;ufficient compen&s;ation for their co&s;t. If calculations of this &s;ort were made upon the &s;trength and labour of bea&s;ts of burden it would not appear &s;o &s;trange, but even then a merciful man would certainly u&s;e his bea&s;t with more mercy than is u&s;ually &s;hewn to the poor Negroes. Will not the groans, the dying groans, of this deeply afflicted and op|pre&s;&s;ed people reach heaven, and when the cup of iniquity is full, mu&s;t not the inevit|able con&s;equence, be the pouring forth of the judgments of God upon their oppre&s;&s;ors?

<P>FROM the foregoing accounts of the natural di&s;po&s;ition of the Negroes, and the fruitfulne&s;s of mo&s;t parts of Guinea, which are confirmed by authors of can|dour, who have wrote from their own knowledge, it may well be concluded, that the Negroes accquaintance with the Euro|peans might have been a happine&s;s to them, if the&s;e la&s;t had not only bore the name, but had al&s;o acted the part of Chri&s;tians, and u&s;ed their endeavours by example as well as precept, to make them acquainted with the

glad tidings of the go&s;pel; which breathes peace and good will to man, and with that change of heart, that redemption from &s;in, which chri&s;tianity propo&s;eth; innocence and love might then have prevailed, nothing would have been wanting to compleat the happine&s;s of the &s;imple Africans: but the rever&s;e has happened; the Europeans for|getful of their duty, as men, and chri&s;|tians, have conducted in &s;o iniquitous a manner, as mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily rai&s;e in the minds of the thoughtful and well di&s;po&s;ed Negroes, the utmo&s;t &s;corn and dete&s;tation of the very name of chri&s;tians. All other con&s;iderations have given way to an in&s;ati|able de&s;ire of gain, which has been the principal and moving cau&s;e of the mo&s;t <HI>ini|quitous and dreadful &s;cene</HI> that was, perhaps, ever acted upon the face of the earth; in|&s;tead of making u&s;e of that &s;uperior know|ledge, with which the Almighty, the common parent of mankind, had favoured them, to &s;trengthen the principle of peace and good will in the brea&s;ts of the incautious Negroes; the Europeans have, by their bad example, led them into exce&s;s of drunkenne&s;s, debauch|ery and avarice; whereby every pa&s;&s;ion of corrupt nature being inflamed, they have been ea&s;ily prevailed upon to make war, and captivate one another; as well to furni&s;h means for the exc&s;&s;es they had been habi|tuated

to, as to &s;atify the greedy de&s;ire of gain in their profligate employers; who to this intent have furni&s;hed them with prodi|gious quantities of arms and amunition. Thus they have been hurried into confu&s;ion, di&s;tre&s;s and all the extremities of temporal mi&s;ery; every thing, even the power of their kings, has been made &s;ub&s;ervient to this wicked purpo&s;e, for in&s;tead of being protectors of their &s;ubjects, &s;ome of tho&s;e rulers corrupted by the exce&s;&s;ive love of &s;pirituous liquors, and the tempting baits laid before them by the factors, have invad|ed the liberties of their unhappy &s;ubjects, and are become their oppre&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>Here it may be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that the accounts we have of the inhabitants of Guinea, are chiefly given by per&s;ons engag|ed in the trade, who, from &s;elf intere&s;ted views, have de&s;cribed them in &s;uch colours as were lea&s;t likely to excite compa&s;&s;ion and re&s;pect, and endeavoured to reconcile &s;o manife&s;t a violation of the rights of mankind to the minds of the purcha&s;ers; yet they cannot but allow the Negroes to be po&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome good qualities, though they contrive as much as po&s;&s;ible to ca&s;t a &s;hade over them. A particular in&s;tance of this appears in A&s;t|ley's collection 2 vol. p. 73, where the au|thor &s;peaking of the Mandingo's &s;ettled at Galem, which is &s;ituated 900 miles up the

With re&s;pect to the charge &s;ome authors have brought again&s;t them as being void of all natural affection, it is frequently contradicted by others: in the 2 vol. of the collec. p. 275, and 629, the Negroes of North Guinea, and the Gold Coa&s;t, are &s;aid, <HI>to be fond of their Child|ren, whom they love with tenderne&s;s.</HI> And Bo&s;man &s;ays p. 340, <Q>Not a few in his country (<HI>viz.</HI> Holland) fondly imagine, that parents here fell their children; men their wives, and one brother the other; but tho&s;e who think &s;o deceive them|&s;elves; for this never happens on any other account but that of nece&s;&s;ity, or &s;ome great crime.</Q> The &s;ame is repeated by J.

At page 110 he &s;ays, <Q>It is well known that many of the European nations trading among&s;t the&s;e people, have very unju&s;tly and inhumanly, without any provocation, &s;tolen away, from time to time, abundance of the people, not only on this coa&s;t, but almo&s;t every where in Guinea who have come on board their &s;hips in a harmle&s;s and confiding manner, the&s;e they have in great numbers car|ried away, and &s;old in the plantations with other &s;laves, which they had purcha&s;ed.</Q>

<P>An account of the &s;hocking inhu|manity u&s;ed in the carrying on of the &s;lave trade, as de&s;cribed by factors of diffe|rent nations, viz.

<P>FIRST Francis Moor, factor for the Eng|li&s;h African company on the river Gambia,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Moor. page 28.</NOTE> writes, <Q>That there is a num|ber of Negro traders called joncoes or merchants, who follow the &s;lave trade, as a bu&s;ine&s;s, their place of re&s;idence is &s;o high up in the country, as to be &s;ix weeks travel from James Fort, which is &s;ituate at the mouth of that river. The&s;e merchants bring down elephants teeth, and in &s;ome years two thou&s;and &s;laves, mo&s;t of which they &s;ay, are pri&s;oners taken in war. They buy them from the

different princes, who take them; many of them are Bumbrongs and Petcharies; nations, who each of them have different languages, and are brought from a va&s;t way inland. Their way of bringing them is tying them by the neck, with leathern thongs, at about a yard di&s;tance from each other, thirty or forty in a &s;tring, having generally a bundle of corn or elephants teeth upon each of their heads. In their way from the mountains, they travel thro' very great woods, where they cannot for &s;ome days get water; &s;o they carry in &s;kin bags enough to &s;upport them for a time. I cannot, (adds Moor) be certain of the number of merchants who follow this trade, but there may, perhaps, be about an hundred, who go up into the inland country, with the goods which they buy from the white men, and with them pur|cha&s;e, in various countries, gold, &s;laves, and elephants teeth. Be&s;ides the &s;laves which the merchants bring down, there are many bought along the river: The&s;e are either taken in war, as the former are, or men condemned for crimes; <HI>or el&s;e peo|ple &s;tolen, which is very frequent.</HI>&mdash;Since the &s;lave trade has been u&s;ed all puni&s;hments are changed into &s;lavery; there being an advantage on &s;uch condemnation, <HI>they

We had not been a fortnight at &s;ea, before the fatal con&s;e|quence of this de&s;pair appeared; they formed a de&s;ign of recovering their natural right, LIBERTY, by ri&s;|ing and murdering every man on board, but the good|ne&s;s of the Almighty rendered their &s;cheme abortive, and his mercy &s;pared us to have time to repent. The plot was di&s;covered; the Ringleader ty'd by the two thumbs over the barricade door, at &s;un-ri&s;e received a number of la&s;hes, in this &s;ituation he remained till &s;un-&s;et, expo&s;ed to the in&s;ults and barbarity of the brutal crew of &s;ailors, with full leave to exerci&s;e their cruelty at plea&s;ure. The con&s;equence of this was, that next morning the mi&s;erable &s;ufferer was found dead, flead from the &s;houlders to the wai&s;t. The next victim was a youth, who, from too &s;trong a &s;en&s;e of his mi&s;ery refu&s;ed nouri&s;hment, and died; di&s;regard|ed and unnoticed, till the hogs had fed on part of his fle&s;h.

There happened to be three Portugue&s;e ve&s;&s;els in &s;ight, who, with others from the &s;hore, putting out their boats, took up about two hundred and fifty of tho&s;e poor &s;ouls who remained alive; of which number about fifty died on &s;hore, being mo&s;tly of tho&s;e who were were fettered together by iron &s;hackles, which as they jumped into the &s;ea, had broke their legs, and the&s;e fractures being inflamed, by &s;o long a &s;truggle in the &s;ea probably mortified, which occa&s;ioned the death of every one that was &s;o wounded.

<P>WHEN the ve&s;&s;els arrive at their de|&s;tined port in the colonies, the poor Negroes are to be di&s;po&s;ed off to the plant|ers, and here they are again expo&s;ed naked, without any di&s;tinction of &s;exes, to the bru|tal examination of their purcha&s;ers; and this, it may well be judged, is to many an|other occa&s;ion of deep di&s;tre&s;s. Add to this, that near connections mu&s;t now again be &s;e|parated to go with their &s;everal purcha&s;ers; this mu&s;t be deeply affecting to all, but &s;uch who&s;e hearts are feared by the love of gain.

not knowing what new &s;tage of di&s;|tre&s;s mu&s;t follow their &s;eparation, or whe|ther they &s;hall ever meet again. And here what &s;ympathy! What commi&s;eration do they meet with! Why, indeed, if they will not &s;eparate as readily as their owners think proper, the Whipper is called for, and the la&s;h is exerci&s;ed upon their naked bodies, till obliged to part.

<P>In a book printed in Liverpool, called, <HI>The Liverpool Memorandum,</HI> which contains among&s;t other things, an account of the trade of that port, there is an exact li&s;t of the ve&s;&s;els employed in the Guinea trade, and of the number of &s;laves imported in each ve&s;&s;el; by which it appears, that in the year 1753, the number imported to America by one hundred and one ve&s;&s;els belonging to that port, amounted to upwards of thirty thou&s;and, and from the number of ve&s;&s;els employed by the African company, in Lon|don and Bri&s;tol, we may, with &s;ome de|gree of certainty, conclude, there are one hundred thou&s;and Negroes purcha&s;ed and brought on board our &s;hips yearly from the coa&s;t of Africa.

Let them con&s;ider, that tho&s;e afflicted &s;tran|gers, though in an <HI>enlightened Chri&s;tian coun|try,</HI> have yet but little opportunity or en|couragement to exert and improve their na|tural talents: They are con&s;tantly employed in &s;ervile labour, and the abject condition in which we &s;ee them, naturally rai&s;es an idea of a &s;uperiority in our&s;elves; whence we are apt to look upon them as an ignorant and contemptible part of mankind. Add to this, that they meet with very little encourage|ment of freely conver&s;ing with &s;uch of the Whites, as might impart in&s;truction to them. It is a fondne&s;s for wealth, for authority or honour which prompts mo&s;t men, in their endeavours to excel; but the&s;e motives can have little influence upon the minds of the Negroes; few of them having any rea&s;on|able pro&s;pect of any other than a &s;tate of &s;la|very; &s;o that, though their natural capaci|ties were ever &s;o good, they have neither in|ducement or opportunity to exert them to advantage: This naturally tends to depre&s;s their minds, and &s;ink their &s;pirits into ha|bits

of idlene&s;s and &s;loth, which they would, in all likelihood, have been free from, had they &s;tood upon an equal footing with the white people. They are &s;uffered, with impunity, to cohabit together, without be|ing married, and to part, when &s;olemnly en|gaged to one another as man and wife; notwith&s;tanding the moral and religious laws of the land, &s;trictly prohibiting &s;uch practices. This naturally tends to beget ap|prehen&s;ion in the mo&s;t thoughtful of tho&s;e people, that we look upon them as a lower race, not worthy of the &s;ame care, nor liable to the &s;ame rewards and puni&s;hments as our|&s;elves. Neverthele&s;s it may with truth be &s;aid, that both among&s;t tho&s;e who have ob|tained their freedom, and tho&s;e who re|main in &s;ervitude, &s;ome have manife&s;ted a &s;trong &s;agacity and an exemplary upright|ne&s;s of heart.

The ca&s;e of a poor Negroe, not long &s;ince brought from Guinea, is a recent in|&s;tance of this kind.

<P>IT is &s;carce to be doubted, but that the foregoing accounts will beget in the heart of the con&s;iderate readers, an earne&s;t de&s;ire to &s;ee a &s;top put to this complicated evil, but the objection with many is, What &s;hall be done with tho&s;e Negroes already imported and born in our families? Mu&s;t they be &s;ent to Africa? That would be to expo&s;e them in a &s;trange land to greater dif|ficulties than many of them labour under at pre&s;ent. To &s;et them &s;uddenly free here, would be, perhaps, attended with no le&s;s difficulty; for undi&s;ciplined as they are in religion and virtue, they might give a loo&s;e to tho&s;e evil habits, which the fear of a ma&s;|ter would have re&s;trained. The&s;e are objec|tions which weigh with many well di&s;po&s;ed people, and it mu&s;t be granted the&s;e are dif|ficulties in the way; nor can any general

change be made or reformation affected without &s;ome; but the difficulties are not &s;o great but that they may be &s;urmounted. If the government was &s;o con&s;iderate of the iniquity and danger attending on this prac|tice as to be willing to &s;eek a remedy, doubt|le&s;s, the Almighty would ble&s;s this good intention, and &s;uch methods would be thought of, as would not only put an end to the unju&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion of the Negroes, but might bring them under regulations that would enable them to become profitable members of &s;ociety. For the furtherance of which, the following propo&s;als are offered to con&s;ideration: That all farther importati|on of &s;laves be ab&s;olutely prohibited; and as to tho&s;e born among&s;t us, after &s;erving &s;o long as may appear to be equitable, let them by law be declared free. Let every one thus &s;et free, be enrolled in the coun|ty courts, and be obliged to be a re&s;ident during a certain number of years within the &s;aid county, under the care of the over|&s;eers of the poor. Thus being, in &s;ome &s;ort, &s;till under the direction of governors and the notice of tho&s;e who were formerly acquainted with them, they would be oblig|ed to act the more circum&s;pectly, and make proper u&s;e of their liberty, and their child|ren

would have an opportunity of obtaining &s;uch in&s;truction as is nece&s;&s;ary to the com|mon occa&s;ions of life, and thus both parents and children might gradually become u&s;eful members of the community. And further, where the nature of the country would per|mit, as certainly the uncultivated condition of our &s;outhern and mo&s;t we&s;tern colonies ea&s;ily would: &s;uppo&s;e a &s;mall tract of land were a&s;&s;igned to every Negroe family, and they obliged to live upon and improve it, (when not hired out to work for the white people) this would encourage them to exert their abilities and become indu&s;trious &s;ub|jects. Hence both planters and trade&s;men would be plentifully &s;upplied with chearful and willing minded labourers, much vacant land would be cultivated; the produce of the country be ju&s;tly encrea&s;ed; the taxes for the &s;upport of government le&s;&s;ened to individuals by the encrea&s;e of taxables.

<P>IT is frequently offered as an argument in vindication of the u&s;e of Negroe &s;laves. That the warmth of the climate in the We&s;t Indies, will not permit white people to la|bour in the culture of the land; but upon an acquaintance with the nature of the cli|mate, and its effects upon &s;uch labouring

white people as are prudent and moderate in labour and the u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors, this will be found to be a mi&s;taken opinion. Tho&s;e i&s;lands were, at fir&s;t, wholly cultivat|ed by white men; the encouragement they then met with for a long cour&s;e of years was &s;uch as occa&s;ioned a great encrea&s;e of people. Richard Ligon, in his hi&s;tory of Barbadoes, where he re&s;ided from the year 1647 to 1650, about 24 years after its fir&s;t &s;ettlement, writes, <Q>that there was then fifty thou&s;and &s;ouls on that i&s;land, be|&s;ides Negroes; and that though the wea|ther was very hot, yet not &s;o &s;calding, but that &s;ervants, both Chri&s;tians and &s;laves laboured ten hours a day.</Q> By other accounts we gather, that the white people have &s;ince decrea&s;ed to le&s;s than one half the number which was there at that time; and by relations of the fir&s;t &s;ettle|ments of the other i&s;lands, we do not meet with any complaints of unfitne&s;s in the white people for labour there, before &s;laves were introduced. The i&s;land of Hi&s;paniola, which is one of the large&s;t of tho&s;e i&s;lands, was at fir&s;t planted by the Bucaneers, a &s;et of har|dy laborious men, who continued &s;o for a long cour&s;e of years, till following the ex|ample of their neighbours in the purcha&s;e and u&s;e of Negroe Slaves, idlene&s;s and ex|ce&s;s prevailing, debility and di&s;ea&s;e natural|ly

&s;ucceeded, and have ever &s;ince conti|nued. If, under proper regulations, liber|ty was proclaimed through the colonies, the Negroes, from a dangerous grudging half fed &s;laves, might become able willing mind|ed Labourers. And if there was not a &s;uffi|cient number of the&s;e to do the nece&s;&s;ary work, a competent number of labouring people might be procured from Europe, which affords numbers of poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed ob|jects, who, if not overlooked, with proper u&s;age, might, in &s;everal re&s;pects, better an|&s;wer every good purpo&s;e in performing the nece&s;&s;ary labour in the i&s;lands than the &s;laves now do.</P>
<P>A farther con&s;iderable advantage might accrue to the Briti&s;h nation in general, if the &s;lave trade was laid a&s;ide, by the cultiva|tion of a fair, friendly and humane com|merce with the Africans, without which it is not po&s;&s;ible the inland trade of that country &s;hould ever be extended to the de|gree it is capable of; for while the &s;pirit of butchery and making &s;laves of each other is promoted by the Europeans among&s;t the Negroes, no mutual confidence can take place; nor will the Europeans be able to travel with &s;afety into the heart of their country to form and cement &s;uch commer|cial friend&s;hips and alliances as might be nece&s;&s;ary to introduce the arts and &s;ciences

<P>SOME per&s;ons re&s;pectable in the law, having given it as their opinion, <Q><HI>That a &s;lave, by coming from the We&s;t-Indies to Great-Britain or Ireland, either with or without his ma&s;ter, doth not become free, or that his ma&s;ter's property or right in him is not thereby determined or varied;&mdash;and that the ma&s;ter may legally compel him to re|turn again to the plantations.</HI></Q>&mdash;This cau&s;es our Author to remark, that the&s;e Lawyers, by thus &s;tating the ca&s;e, merely on one &s;ide of the que&s;tion, (I mean in fa|vour of the ma&s;ter) have occa&s;ioned an un|ju&s;t pre&s;umption and prejudice, (plainly in|con&s;i&s;tent with the laws of the realm) and a|gain&s;t the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion; as they have not &s;ignified that their opinion was only conditional and not ab&s;olute, and mu&s;t be under&s;tood on the part of the ma&s;|ter, "<HI>that he can produce an authentic agree|ment or contract in writing, by which it &s;hall appear, that the &s;aid &s;lave hath voluntary bound him&s;elf without compul&s;ion or illegal dure&s;s.</HI>"</P>

of England, but (God be thanked) there is neither law nor even a precedent, (at lea&s;t I have not been able to find one) of a legal determination to ju&s;tify a ma&s;ter in claim|ing or detaining any per&s;on what&s;oever as a &s;lave in England, who has not voluntarily bound him&s;elf as &s;uch by a contract in writ|ing.</P>
<P>Page 20. An Engli&s;h &s;ubject cannot be made a &s;lave without his own free con&s;ent, but&mdash;a foreign &s;lave is made a &s;ubject with or without his own con&s;ent; there needs no contract for this purpo&s;e as in the other ca&s;e; nor any other act or deed what|&s;oever, but that of his being landed in Eng|land; for according to a &s;tatute of 32d Hen|ry, VIII. c. 16. Sect. 9. <Q><HI>Every alien or &s;tran|ger, born out of the King's obei&s;ance, not being denizen, which now or hereafter &s;hall come into this realm, or el&s;ewhere within the King's dominions, &s;hall, after the &s;aid fir&s;t of September next coming, be bounden by and unto the laws and &s;tatutes of this realm, and to all and &s;ingular the contents of the &s;ame.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that though this law makes no di&s;tin&s;tion of <HI>bond or free,</HI> neither of colours or complexions, whether of <HI>black, brown,</HI> or <HI>white,</HI> for <Q><HI>every alien or &s;tranger</HI> (without exception) <HI>are bounden by and unto the law,</HI> &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>This binding or obligation, is properly

expre&s;&s;ed by the Engli&s;h word Ligeance, (<HI>a Ligando</HI>) which may be either perpetual or temporary. Wood 6. 1. c. 3. p. 37. but one of the&s;e is indi&s;pen&s;ably due to the Sovereign from all ranks and conditions of people, their being bounden unto the laws, (upon which the Sovereign's right is founded) ex|pre&s;&s;es and implies this &s;ubjection to the laws, and therefore to alledge, that an alien is not a &s;ubject, becau&s;e he is in bondage, is not only a plea without foundation, but a con|tradiction in terms, for every per&s;on who in any re&s;pect is in &s;ubjection to the laws, mu&s;t undoubtedly be a &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I come now to the main point&mdash;"<HI>that every man, woman, or child, that now is, or hereafter &s;hall be an inhabitant or re&s;iant of this kingdom of England, dominion of Wales, or town of Berwick upon Tweed,</HI>" is, in &s;ome re&s;pect or other, the <HI>King's &s;ubject,</HI> and as &s;uch, is ab&s;olutely &s;ecure in his, or her <HI>per|&s;onal liberty,</HI> by virtue of a &s;tatute, 31&s;t Car. II. ch. 11, and particularly by the 12th Sect. of the &s;ame (wherein &s;ubjects of all condi|tions are plainly included.)</P>
<P>This act is expre&s;sly intended for the bet|ter &s;ecuring the liberty of the &s;ubject, and for prevention of impri&s;onment beyond the &s;eas. It contains no di&s;tinction of "<HI>natural born, naturalized, denizen, or alien &s;ubject, nor of white or black, freemen or even of bond men,</HI>"

(except in the ca&s;e already mentioned <HI>of a contract in writing,</HI> by which it &s;hall appear, <HI>that the &s;aid &s;lave have voluntarily bound him|&s;elf without compul&s;ion or illegal dure&s;s</HI>) allowed by the 13th Sect. and the exception likewi&s;e in the 14th Sect. concerning felons, but they are all included under the general titles of "<HI>the &s;ubject, any of the &s;aid &s;ubjects," every &s;uch per&s;on, &amp;c.</HI> Now the definition of the word "<HI>per&s;on</HI>" in its relative or civil capaci|ty (according to Wood. b. 1. c. 11. p. 27) <HI>is either the King or a &s;ubject.</HI> The&s;e are the <HI>only capital di&s;tinctions</HI> that can be made; though the latter con&s;i&s;ts of a variety of de|nominations and degrees.</P>
<P>But if I were even to allow, that a <HI>Negroe &s;lave</HI> is not a &s;ubject, (though I think I have clearly proved that he is) yet it is plain, that &s;uch an one ought not to be denied the be|nefit of the King's court, unle&s;s the &s;lave|holder &s;hall be able to prove likewi&s;e, that he is not a <HI>Man,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>every man</HI> may be <HI>free</HI> to &s;ue for and <HI>defend his right in our courts,</HI> &s;ays a &s;tat. 20th Edw.

The former cannot a&s;&s;i&s;t him, becau&s;e the &s;tatute law at pre&s;ent is &s;o far from &s;up|po&s;ing any man in a &s;tate of &s;lavery, that it cannot even permit &s;uch a &s;tate, except in the two ca&s;es mentioned in the 13th and 14th Section of the Habeas Corpus act; and the courts of equity likewi&s;e mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily decide again&s;t him, becau&s;e his mere merce|nary

<P>How then is the &s;lave-holder to &s;ecure what he e&s;teems his <HI>property?</HI> Perhaps he will endeavour clande&s;tinely to &s;eize the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;lave in order to tran&s;port him, (with or without <HI>his con&s;ent</HI>) to the colonies, where &s;uch property it allowed: But let him take care what he does, the very attempt is pu|ni&s;hable, and even the making over his pro|perty to another for that purpo&s;e, renders him equally liable to the &s;evere penalties of the law, for a bill of &s;ale may certainly be included under the terms expre&s;&s;ed in the Habeas Corpus act, 12th Sect. <HI>viz.</HI> "<HI>Anywar|rant or writing for &s;uch commitment, detainer, impri&s;onment or tran&s;portation, &amp;c.</HI>" It is al&s;o dangerous for a coun&s;ellor or any other per&s;on <HI>to advi&s;e</HI>" (&s;ee the act "&s;hall be advi&s;ing") &s;uch proceedings by &s;aying, "<HI>that a ma&s;ter may legally compel him,</HI> (the &s;lave) <HI>to return again to the plantations.</HI>" Likewi&s;e an Attorney, Notary-public, or any other per&s;on, who &s;hall pre&s;ume to draw up, negotiate, or even to witne&s;s a bill of &s;ale, or other in&s;trument, for &s;uch committment, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> offends equally again&s;t the law, becau&s;e, "<HI>All, or any per|&s;on or per&s;ons that &s;hall frame, contrive, write,

<P>&mdash;I have before ob&s;erved, that the ge|neral term, "<HI>every Alien,</HI>" includes <HI>all &s;trangers what&s;oever,</HI> and renders them <HI>&s;ub|ject</HI> to the King and the laws during their re|&s;idence in this kingdom; and this is certain|ly true, whether the aliens be Turks, Moors, Arabians, Tartars, or even &s;avages from any part of the world.&mdash;Men are rendered ob|noxious to the laws by their offences, and not by the particular denomination of their rank, order, parentage, colour or country, and therefore, though we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, that any particular body of people what&s;oe|ever were not known, or had in con&s;idera|tion by the legi&s;lature at the different times
<PB N="10" REF="011985_0162_0F87EE9D598635D0">
when the &s;evere penal laws were made, yet no man can rea&s;onably conceive, that &s;uch men are exempted on this account from the penalties of the &s;aid laws, when legally con|victed of having offended again&s;t them.</P>
<P>Laws calculated for the moral purpo&s;e of preventing oppre&s;&s;ion, are likewi&s;e u&s;ually &s;uppo&s;ed to be everla&s;ting, and to make up a part of our happy con&s;titution; for which rea&s;on, though the kind of oppre&s;&s;ion to be guarded again&s;t, and the penalties for of|fenders are minutely de&s;cribed therein, yet the per&s;ons to be protected are comprehend|ed in terms as general as po&s;&s;ible; that "<HI>no per&s;on who now is, or hereafter &s;hall be an in|habitant or re&s;iant in this kingdom,</HI> (&s;ee Habe|as Corpus act, Sect. 12th) may &s;eem to be excluded from protection.

which all mankind have an undoubted right, their <HI>natural liberty:</HI> Though the law makes no mention of Negroe &s;laves, yet this is no ju&s;t argument for excluding them from the general protection of our happy con&s;ti|tution.</P>
<P>Neither can the objection, that Negroe &s;laves were not "had in con&s;ideration or contemplation" when the&s;e laws were made, prove any thing again&s;t them; but, on the contrary, much in their favour; for both the&s;e circum&s;tances are &s;trong pre&s;ump|tive proofs, that the practice of importing &s;laves into this kingdom, and retaining them as &s;uch, is an innovation entirely foreign to the &s;pirit and intention of the laws now in force.</P>
<P>&mdash;Page 79. A toleration of &s;lavery, is, in effect, a toleration of inhumanity; for there are wretches in the world, who make no &s;cruple to gain, by wearing out their &s;laves with continual labour, and a &s;canty allowance, before they have lived out half their natural days. 'Tis notorious, that this is too often the ca&s;e in the unhappy coun|tries where &s;lavery is tolerated.</P>
<P>See the account of the European &s;ettle|ments in America, Part VI. Chap. 11. con|cerning the "<HI>mi&s;ery of the Negroes, great wa&s;te of them, &amp;c.</HI> which informs us, not only of a mo&s;t &s;candalous profanation of the

<P>At pre&s;ent the inhumanity of con&s;trained labour in exce&s;s, extends no farther in Eng|land, than to our bea&s;ts, as po&s;t and hack|ney hor&s;es, &s;and a&s;&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But thanks to our laws, and not to the general good di&s;po&s;ition of ma&s;ters, that it is &s;o, for the wretch, who is bad enough to mal-treat a helple&s;s bea&s;t, would not &s;pare his fellow man, if he had him as much in his power.</P>
<P>The maintenance of civil liberty, is there|fore, ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to prevent an en|crea&s;e of our national guilt, by the addition of the horrid crime of tyranny.&mdash;Notwith|&s;tanding that the plea of nece&s;&s;ity cannot here be urged, yet this is no rea&s;on why an increa&s;e of the practice is not to be feared.</P>
<P>Our North America colonies afford us a melancholy in&s;tance to the contrary;&mdash;for though the climate in general is &s;o whole|&s;ome and temperate, that it will not autho|ri&s;e this plea of nece&s;&s;ity for the employment of &s;laves, any more than our own, yet the pernicious practice of &s;lave-holding is be|come almo&s;t general in tho&s;e parts. At New-York, for in&s;tance, the infringement on ci|vil

or dome&s;tic liberty is become notorious, notwith&s;tanding the political controver&s;ies of the inhabitants in prai&s;e of liberty; but no panegyrick on this &s;ubject (how&s;oever elegant in it&s;elf) can be graceful, or edify|ing from the mouth, or pen of one of tho&s;e provincials; becau&s;e men, who do not &s;cru|ple to detain others in &s;lavery, have but a very partial and unju&s;t claim to the protection of the laws of liberty; and indeed it too plainly appears, that they have no real re|gard for liberty, farther than their own private intere&s;ts are concerned; and (con&s;e|quently) that they have &s;o little dete&s;tation for de&s;poti&s;m and tyranny, that they do not &s;cruple to exerci&s;e them whenever their ca|price excites them, or their private intere&s;t &s;eems to require an exertion of their power over their mi&s;erable &s;laves.</P>
<P>Every petty planter, who avails him&s;elf of the &s;ervice of &s;laves, is an arbitrary mo|narch, or rather a lawle&s;s Ba&s;haw in his own territories, notwith&s;tanding that the imagi|nary freedom of the province wherein he re|&s;ides, may &s;eem to forbid the ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>The boa&s;ted liberty of our American co|lonies, therefore, has &s;o little right to that &s;acred name, that it &s;eems to differ from the arbitrary power of de&s;potic monarchs, only in one circum&s;tance, <HI>viz.</HI> that it is a <HI>many|headed mon&s;ter of tyranny,</HI> which entirely &s;ub|verts

<P>This circum&s;tance of confining a man without a warrant, has &s;o great a re&s;em|blance to the proceedings of a Popi&s;h inqui|&s;ition, that it is but too obvious what dan|gerous practices &s;uch &s;candalous innovations (if permitted to grow more into u&s;e) are li|able to introduce.

time, be no protection again&s;t &s;uch outra|ges, e&s;pecially, as not only Negroes, but Mullatoes, and even American Indians, (which appears by one of the Adverti&s;e|ments before quoted) are retained in &s;lavery in our American colonies; for there are many hone&s;t weather-beaten Engli&s;hmen, who have as little rea&s;on to boa&s;t of their complexion as the Indians. And indeed the more northern Indians, have no difference from us in complexion, but &s;uch as is occa|&s;ioned by the climate or different way of living.

<P>This law breathes the pure &s;pirit of liber|ty, equity and &s;ocial love; being calculated to maintain that con&s;ideration and mutual regard, which one per&s;on ought to have for another how&s;oever unequal in rank or &s;ta|tion.</P>
<P>But when any part of the community, under the pretence of private property, is de|prived of this common privilege, 'tis a vio|lation of civil liberty, which is entirely in|con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;ocial principles of a free &s;tate.</P>
<P>True liberty protects the labourer, as well as his Lord; pre&s;erves the dignity of hu|man nature, and &s;eldom fails to render a province rich and populous; whereas, on the other hand, a toleration of &s;lavery is the highe&s;t breach of &s;ocial virtue, and not only tends to depopulation, but too often renders the minds of both ma&s;ters and &s;laves utter|ly depraved and inhuman, by the hateful extremes of exaltation and depre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>If &s;uch a toleration &s;hould ever be gener|ally admitted in England, (which God for|bid) we &s;hall no longer de&s;erve to be e&s;teem|ed a civilized people; becau&s;e, when the

<P>Then mu&s;t the happy medium of a well regulated liberty be nece&s;&s;arily compelled to find &s;helter in &s;ome more civilized country, where &s;ocial virtue, and that divine precept, "<HI>Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf,</HI>" are better under&s;tood.</P>
<P>An attempt to prove the dangerous ten|dency, inju&s;tice and di&s;grace of tolerating &s;lavery among&s;t Engli&s;hmen, would in any former age have been e&s;teemed as &s;uperflu|ous and ridiculous, as if a man &s;hould un|dertake in a formal manner to prove, that darkne&s;s is not light.</P>

The&s;e puni&s;hments are &s;uffered by them with great con&s;tancy.&mdash;For negligence, they are u&s;ually whipped by the over&s;eers with lance-wood &s;witches, till they be bloody, and &s;everal of the &s;witches broken, being fir&s;t tied up by their hands in the mill hou&s;es.&mdash;Af|ter they are whipped till they are raw, &s;ome put on their &s;kins pepper and &s;alt, to make them &s;mart; at other times their ma&s;ters will drop melted wax on their &s;kins, and u&s;e &s;everal <HI>very exqui&s;ite torments.</HI></Q> Sir Hans adds, <Q>The&s;e puni&s;hments are &s;ometimes merited by the blacks, who are a very perver&s;e generation of people, and though they appear very har&s;h, yet are &s;carce equal to &s;ome of their crimes, and inferior to what puni&s;hments other Euro|pean nations inflict on their &s;laves in the Ea&s;t-Indies, as may be &s;een by Moquet, and other travellers.</Q> Thus &s;ir Hans Sloan
<PB N="24" REF="011985_0176_0F87EEA7D9631D70">
endeavours to excu&s;e tho&s;e &s;hocking cruelties, but certainly in vain: becau&s;e no crimes what&s;oever can merit &s;uch &s;evere puni&s;h|ments, unle&s;s I except the crimes of tho&s;e who devi&s;e and inflict them. Sir Hans Sloan indeed, mentions <HI>rebellion,</HI> as the principal crime, and certainly it is very ju&s;tly e&s;teem|ed a mo&s;t heinous crime, in a land of liber|ty, where government is limited by equita|ble and ju&s;t laws, if the &s;ame are tolerably well ob&s;erved; but in countries where ar|bitrary power is exerci&s;ed with &s;uch intolera|ble cruelty, as is before de&s;cribed, if re&s;i&s;t|ance be a crime, it is certainly the mo&s;t na|tural of all others.</P>
<P>But the 19th clau&s;e of the 38th act, would indeed on a &s;light peru&s;al induce us to conceive, that the puni&s;hment for rebelli|on is not &s;o &s;evere as it is repre&s;ented by &s;ir Hans Sloan; becau&s;e a &s;lave, though <HI>deem|ed rebellious,</HI> is thereby condemned to no greater puni&s;hment than tran&s;portation. Ne|verthele&s;s if the clau&s;e be thoroughly con&s;i|dered we &s;hall find no rea&s;on to commend the mercy of the legi&s;lature; for it only proves, that the Jamaica law-makers will not &s;cruple to charge the &s;lighte&s;t and mo&s;t natural offences with the mo&s;t opprobrious epithets; and that a poor &s;lave who per|haps has no otherwi&s;e incurred his ma&s;ter's

di&s;plea&s;ure than by endeavouring (upon the ju&s;t and warrantable principles of &s;elf-pre&s;er|vation) to e&s;cape from his ma&s;ter's tyranny, without any criminal intention what&s;oever, is liable to be <HI>deemed rebellious,</HI> and to be ar|raigned as a capital offender. <Q>For every &s;lave, and &s;laves that &s;hall run away and con|tinue but for the &s;pace of twelve months, ex|cept &s;uch &s;lave or &s;laves as &s;hall not have been three years in this i&s;land, &s;hall be <HI>deemed rebellious,</HI></Q> &amp;c. (&s;ee act 38, clau&s;e 19. p. 60.) Thus we are enabled to define what a We&s;t Indian tyrant means by the word <HI>rebellious.</HI> But unju&s;t as this clau&s;e may &s;eem, yet it is abundantly more merciful and con&s;iderate than a &s;ub&s;equent act again&s;t the &s;ame poor mi&s;erable people, becau&s;e the former a&s;&s;igns no other puni&s;hment for per&s;ons &s;o <HI>deemed rebellious</HI> than that they, "<HI>Shall be tran&s;|ported</HI> by order of two ju&s;tices and three freeholders," &amp;c. whereas the latter &s;pares not the blood of the&s;e poor injured fugitives: For by the 66th act, a reward of 50 pound is offered to tho&s;e who, <Q>&s;hall kill or bring in alive any <HI>rebellious &s;laves,</HI></Q> that is, any of the&s;e unfortunate people whom the law has "<HI>deemed rebellious,</HI>" as above; and this premium is not only tendered to commi&s;&s;i|oned parties (&s;ee 2d. clau&s;e) but even to any private "<HI>hunter, &s;lave or other per&s;on,</HI>" (&s;ee 3d.

Thus it is manife&s;t, that the law treats the&s;e poor unhappy men with as little ceremony and con&s;ideration, as if they were merely wild bea&s;ts. But the innocent blood that is &s;hed in con&s;equence of &s;uch a dete&s;table law, mu&s;t certainly call for vengeance on the murderous abettors and actors of &s;uch de|liberate wickedne&s;s: And though many of the guilty wretches &s;hould even be &s;o hard|ened and abandoned as never afterwards to be capable of &s;incere remor&s;e, yet a time will undoubtedly come, when they will &s;hudder with dreadful apprehen&s;ions, on account of the in&s;ufficiency of &s;o wretched an excu&s;e, as that their poor murdered brethren were by law "<HI>deemed rebellious.</HI>" But bad as the&s;e laws are, yet, in ju&s;tice to the free|holders of Jamaica, I mu&s;t acknowledge, that their laws are not near &s;o cruel and in|human as the laws of Barbadoes and Vir|ginia, and &s;eem at pre&s;ent, to be much more rea&s;onable than they have formerly been, many very oppre&s;&s;ive laws being now expired, and others le&s;s &s;evere enacted in their room.</P>

I. ch. 4. &s;ect. 3. p. 339.) wherein it is ordained, <Q>that every &s;lave com|mitting &s;uch offence as by the laws ought to be puni&s;hed by death or lo&s;s of member, &s;hall be forth with committed to the common goal of the county, &amp;c. And the &s;heriff of &s;uch county, upon &s;uch commitment, &s;hall forthwith certify the &s;ame,</Q> with the cau&s;e

thereof, to the governor or commander in chief, &amp;c. who is thereupon de&s;ired and im|powered to i&s;&s;ue a commi&s;&s;ion of oyer and terminer; <HI>To &s;uch per&s;ons as he &s;hall think fit;</HI> which per&s;ons, forthwith after the receipt of &s;uch commi&s;&s;ion, are impowered and requir|ed to cau&s;e the offender to be publicly ar|raigned and tried, &amp;c. without the &s;olemni|ty of a jury, &amp;c. Now let us con&s;ider the dan|gerous tendency of tho&s;e laws. As Engli&s;h|men, we &s;trenuou&s;ly contend for this ab&s;o|lute and immutable nece&s;&s;ity of trials by ju|ries: but is not the &s;pirit and equity of this old Engli&s;h doctrine entirely loft, if we partially confine that ju&s;tice to our&s;elves a|lone, when we have it in our power to ex|tend it to others? The natural right of all mankind mu&s;t principally ju&s;tify our in&s;i&s;t|ing upon this nece&s;&s;ary privilege in favour of our&s;elves in particular, and therefore if we do not allow that the judgment of an impartial jury is indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary in all ca&s;es what&s;oever, wherein the life of man is depending, we certainly undermine the equitable force and rea&s;on of tho&s;e laws, by which <HI>we our&s;elves are protected,</HI> and con|&s;equently are unworthy to be e&s;teemed, ei|ther Chri&s;tians or Engli&s;hmen.</P>
<P>Whatever right the members of a pro|vincial a&s;&s;embly may have to enact <HI>bye laws,</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="011985_0184_0F87EEADD9543CD8">
for particular exigences among them&s;elves, yet in &s;o doing, they are certainly bound in duty to their &s;overeign, to ob&s;erve mo&s;t &s;trictly, the fundamental principles of that con&s;titution, which his maje&s;ty is &s;worn to maintain; for where&s;oever the bounds of the Briti&s;h empire are extended, there the common law of England mu&s;t of cour&s;e take place, and cannot be &s;afely &s;et a&s;ide by any <HI>private law</HI> what&s;oever, becau&s;e the intro|duction of an unnatural tyranny mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily endanger the king's dominions. The many alarming in&s;urrections of &s;laves in the &s;everal colonies, are &s;ufficient proofs of this. The common law of England ought there|fore to be &s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed in every province, as to include the re&s;pective <HI>bye laws</HI> of each province; in&s;tead of being by them <HI>excluded</HI> which latter has been too much the ca&s;e.</P>

<P>GEORGE WALLIS, in his <HI>&s;y&s;|tem of the principles of the laws of Scot|land,</HI> &s;peaking of the &s;lavery of the Negroes in our colonies, &s;ays "We all know that they (the <HI>Negroes</HI>) are purcha&s;ed from their Princes, who pretend to have a right to di&s;|po&s;e of them, and that they are, like other commodities, tran&s;ported by the merchants who have bought them, into <HI>America,</HI> in or|der to be expo&s;ed to &s;ale. If this trade ad|mits of a moral or a rational ju&s;tification, every crime, even the mo&s;t atrocious, may be ju&s;tified. Government was in&s;tituted for the good of mankind; kings, princes, governors, are not proprietors of tho&s;e who are &s;ubject to their authority; they have not a right to make them mi&s;erable. On the contrary, their authority is ve&s;ted in them, that they may, by the ju&s;t exerci&s;e of it, promote the happine&s;s of their people. Of cour&s;e, they have not a right to di&s;po&s;e of their liberty, and to &s;ell them for &s;laves. Be|&s;ides,

no man has a right to acquire or to purcha&s;e them; men and their liberty are not (<HI>in commercio</HI>) they are not either &s;aleable or purcha&s;able. One, therefore, has nobo|dy but him&s;elf to blame, in ca&s;e he &s;hall find him&s;elf deprived of a man, whom he thought he had, by buying for a price, made his own; for he dealt in a trade which was illicit, and was prohibited by the mo&s;t obvious dictates of humanity. For the&s;e rea&s;ons every one of tho&s;e unfortunate men who are pretended to be &s;laves, has a right to be declared to be free, for he never lo&s;t his liberty; he could not lo&s;e it; his prince had no power to di&s;po&s;e of him. Of cour&s;e the &s;ale was <HI>ip&s;o jure</HI> void. This right he carries about with him, and is entitled e|very where to get it declared. As &s;oon, therefore, as he comes into a country in which the judges are not forgetful of their own humanity, it is their duty to remem|ber that he is a man, and to declare him to be free.

Is it doubtful, whether a judge ought to pay greater regard to them, than to tho&s;e arbitrary and inhu|man u&s;ages which prevail in a di&s;tant land? Aye, but our colonies would be ruined if &s;lavery was aboli&s;hed. Be it &s;o; would it not from thence follow, that the bulk of mankind ought to be abu&s;ed, that our pockets may be filled with money, or our mouths with delicacies? The pur&s;es of highwaymen would be empty in ca&s;e robberies were to|tally aboli&s;hed; but have men a right to ac|quire money by going out to the highway?

There is &s;uch a thing as ju&s;tice, to which the mo&s;t &s;acred regard is due. It ought to be inviolably ob&s;erved.

therefore our colonies be ruined, but let us not render &s;o many men mi&s;erable.

<P>But it is fal&s;e, that either we or our co|lonies would be ruined by the abolition of &s;lavery. It might occa&s;ion a &s;tagnation of bu&s;ine&s;s for a &s;hort time.

<HEAD>EXTRACT From an ADDRESS IN THE VIRGINIA GAZETTE, of MARCH 19, 1767.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. RIND,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PERMIT me, in your paper, to addre&s;s the members of our a&s;&s;embly, on two points, in which the public intere&s;t is very nearly concerned.</P>
<P>The abolition of &s;lavery and the retriev|al of &s;pecie in this colony, are the &s;ubjects on which I would be&s;peak their attention.&mdash;</P>
<P>Long and &s;erious reflections upon the na|ture and con&s;equences of &s;lavery have con|vinced me, that it is a violation both of ju&s;|tice and religion; that it is dangerous to the &s;afety of the community in which it prevails; that it is de&s;tructive to the growth of arts and &s;ciences; and la&s;tly, that it pro|duces a numerous and very fatal train of vices, both in the &s;lave, and in his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>To prove the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions, &s;hall be the pur|po&s;e of the following e&s;&s;ay.</P>
<P>That &s;lavery then is a violation of ju&s;tice,
<PB N="45" REF="011985_0198_0F8DA1B2754E9B40">
will plainly appear, when we con&s;ider what ju&s;tice is. It is truly and &s;imply defined, as by <HI>Ju&s;tinian, con&s;tans et perpetua volun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">as, ejus &s;uum cuique tribuendi;</HI> a con&s;tant endea|vour to give every man his right.</P>
<P>Now, as freedom is unque&s;tionably the birthright of all mankind, <HI>Africans</HI> as well as <HI>Europeans,</HI> to keep the former in a &s;tate of &s;lavery, is a con&s;tant violation of that right, and therefore of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The ground on which the civilians who favour &s;lavery, admit it to be ju&s;t; namely, con&s;ent, force and birth, is totally di&s;puta|ble. For &s;urely a man's own will and con|&s;ent, cannot be allowed to introduce &s;o im|portant an innovation into &s;ociety as &s;lave|ry, or to make him&s;elf an outlaw, which is really the &s;tate of a &s;lave, &s;ince neither con|&s;enting to, nor aiding the laws of the &s;ociety, in which he lives, he is neither bound to o|bey them, nor entitled to their protection.</P>
<P>To found any right in force, is to fru&s;|trate all right, and involve every thing in confu&s;ion, violence and rapine. With the&s;e two the la&s;t mu&s;t fall, &s;ince if the parent cannot ju&s;tly be made a &s;lave, neither can the child be born in &s;lavery. "The law of nations, &s;ays baron <HI>Monte&s;quieu,</HI> has doom|ed pri&s;oners to &s;lavery, to prevent their be|ing &s;lain; the <HI>Roman</HI> civil law, permitted debtors whom their creditors might treat
<PB N="46" REF="011985_0199_0F87EE44DA20B880">
ill, to &s;ell them&s;elves. And the law of na|ture requires that children, whom their parents being &s;laves cannot maintain, &s;hould be &s;laves like them. The&s;e rea&s;ons of the civilians are not ju&s;t, it is not true that a captive may be &s;lain, unle&s;s in a ca&s;e of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity; but if he hath been re|duced to &s;lavery, it is plain that no &s;uch ne|ce&s;&s;ity exi&s;ted, &s;ince he was not &s;lain. It is not true that a free man can &s;ell him&s;elf, for &s;ale &s;uppo&s;es a price, but a &s;lave and his pro|perty becomes immediately that of his ma&s;|ter, the &s;lave can therefore receive no price, nor the ma&s;ter pay, &amp;c. And if a man cannot &s;ell him&s;elf, nor a pri&s;oner of war be reduced to &s;lavery, much le&s;s can his child." Such are the &s;entiments of this il|lu&s;trious civilian; his rea&s;onings, which I have been obliged to contract, the reader in|tere&s;ted in this &s;ubject, will do well to con|&s;ult at large.</P>
<P>Yet even the&s;e rights of impo&s;ing &s;lavery, que&s;tionable, nay refutable as they are, we have not to authorize the bondage of the <HI>Africans.</HI> For neither do they con&s;ent to be our &s;laves, nor do we purcha&s;e them of their conquerors. The <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> merchants obtain them from <HI>Africa</HI> by violence, artifice and treachery, with a few trinkets to prompt tho&s;e unfortunate****people to en&s;lave one another by force or &s;tratagem.

them indeed they may, under the authori|ty of an act of the Briti&s;h parliament. An act entailing upon the <HI>Africans,</HI> with whom we are not at war, and over whom a Briti&s;h parliament could not of right a&s;&s;ume even a &s;hadow of authority, the dreadful cur&s;e of perpetual &s;lavery, upon them and their chil|dren for ever. <HI>There cannot be in nature, there is not in all hi&s;tory, an in&s;tance in which every right of men is more flagrantly violated.</HI> The laws of the antients never authorized the making &s;laves, but of tho&s;e nations whom they had conquered; yet they were heathens and we are chri&s;tians. They were mi&s;led by a mon&s;trous religion, dive&s;ted of humanity, by a horrible and barbarous wor|&s;hip; we are directed by the unerring pre|cepts of the revealed religion we po&s;&s;e&s;s, en|lightned by its wi&s;dom, and humanized by its benevolence; before them were gods de|formed with pa&s;&s;ions, and horrible for eve|ry cruelty and vice; before us is that in|comparable pattern of meekne&s;s, charity, love and ju&s;tice to mankind, which &s;o tran|&s;cendently di&s;tingui&s;hed the founder of chri|&s;tianity and his ever amiable doctrines.</P>
<P>Reader, remember that the corner &s;tone of your religion is to do unto others as you would they &s;hould do unto you; a&s;k then your own heart whether it would not ab|hor any one, as the mo&s;t outrageous viola|tor
<PB N="48" REF="011985_0201_0F87EE465A2125E0">
of that and every other principle of right, ju&s;tice and humanity, who &s;hould make a &s;lave of you and your po&s;terity for ever. Remember that God knoweth the heart, lay not this flattering unction to your &s;oul, that it is the cu&s;tom of the country; that you found it &s;o: that not your will but your ne|ce&s;&s;ity con&s;ents. Ah! think how little &s;uch an excu&s;e will avail you in that awful day, when your Saviour &s;hall pronounce judg|ment on you for breaking a law too plain to be mi&s;under&s;tood, too &s;acred to be violated. If we &s;ay we are chri&s;tians, yet act more in|humanly and unju&s;tly than heathens, with what dreadful ju&s;tice mu&s;t this &s;entence of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour fall upon us: "Not e|very one that &s;aith unto me Lord, Lord, &s;hall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doth the will of my father which is in heaven." (<HI>Matthew</HI> vii. 21.) Think a moment how much your temporal, your eternal welfare depends upon an abolition of a practice, which deforms the image of your God, tramples on his revealed will, infringes the mo&s;t &s;acred rights, and vio|lates humanity.</P>
<P>Enough I hope has been a&s;&s;erted to prove that &s;lavery is a violation of ju&s;tice and re|ligion. That it is dangerous to the &s;afety of the &s;tate in which it prevails, may be as &s;afely a&s;&s;erted.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="011985_0202_0F87EE471A301618">
What one's own experience has not taught, that of others mu&s;t decide. From hence does hi&s;tory derive its utility; for being, when truly written, a faithful record of the tran&s;actions of mankind, and the con&s;e|quences that flowed from them, we are thence furni&s;hed with the means of judging what will be the probable effect of tran&s;actions &s;i|milar among our&s;elves.</P>
<P>We learn then from hi&s;tory, that &s;lavery, wherever encouraged, has &s;ooner or later been productive of very dangerous commo|tions. I will not trouble my reader here with quotations in &s;upport of this a&s;&s;ertion, but content my&s;elf with referring tho&s;e who may be dubious of its truth, to the hi&s;tories of <HI>Athens, Lacedemon, Rome,</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>How long, how bloody and de&s;tructive was the conte&s;t between the Moori&s;h &s;laves, and the native Spaniards? and after almo&s;t deluges of blood had been &s;hed the Spaniards obtained nothing more, than driving them into the mountains.&mdash;Le&s;s bloody in|deed, tho' not le&s;s alarming have been the in&s;urrections in Jamaica; and to imagine that we &s;hall be for ever exempted from this calamity, which experience teaches us to be in&s;eparable from &s;lavery, &s;o encouraged, is an infatuation as a&s;toni&s;hing as it will be &s;urely fatal.&mdash;&amp;c. &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>EXTRACT OF A SERMON, PREACHED BY THE BISHOP OF GLOUCESTER, Before the SOCIETY for the PROPAGATION of the GOSPEL, at their anniver&s;ary meeting, on the 21&s;t of February, 1766.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the free-&s;avages I now come (the la&s;t point I propo&s;e to con&s;ider) to the &s;avages in bonds. By the&s;e I mean the va&s;t multitudes yearly &s;tolen from the oppo|&s;ite continent, and &s;acrificed by the colo|ni&s;ts to their great idol, the GOD OF GAIN. But what then, &s;ay the&s;e &s;incere wor&s;hip|pers of <HI>Mammon,</HI> they are our own property, which we offer up. Gracious God! to talk (as in herds of cattle) of property in rational creatures! creatures endowed with all our faculties, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all our qualities but that of colour; our brethren both by nature and

grace, &s;hocks all the feelings of humanity, and the dictates of common &s;en&s;e. But, a|las! what is there in the infinite abu&s;es of &s;ociety which does not &s;hock them? Yet nothing is more certain in it&s;elf, and appa|rent to all, than that the infamous traffic for &s;laves directly infringes both divine and human law. Nature created man free; and grace invites him to a&s;&s;ert his freedom. In excu&s;e of this violation, it hath been pretended, that though indeed the&s;e mi&s;e|rable outca&s;ts of humanity be torn from their homes and native country by fraud and violence, yet they thereby become the happier, and their condition the more eligi|ble. But who are YOU, who pretend to judge of another man's happine&s;s? That &s;tate, which each man, under the guidance of his maker, forms for him&s;elf; and not one man for another. To know what con|&s;titutes mine or your happine&s;s, is the &s;ole prerogative of him who created us, and ca&s;t us in &s;o various and different moulds. Did your &s;laves ever complain to you of their unhappine&s;s amid&s;t their native woods and de&s;arts? Or, rather, let me a&s;k, did they ever cea&s;e complaining of their condition under you their lordly ma&s;ters? where they &s;ee, indeed, the accommodations of civil life, but &s;ee them all pa&s;s to others, them|&s;elves, unbenefited by them. Be &s;o graci|ous

then, ye petty tyrants over human free|dom, to let your &s;laves judge for them&s;eves, what it is which makes their own happine&s;s. And then &s;ee whether they do not place it in the return to their own country, rather than in the contemplation of your grandeur, of which their mi&s;ery makes &s;o large a part. A return &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately longed for, that de&s;pairing of happine&s;s here, that is, of e|&s;caping the chains of their cruel ta&s;k ma&s;ters, they con&s;ole them&s;elves with feigning it to be the gracious reward of heaven in their future &s;tate; which I do not find their haughty ma&s;ters have as yet concerned them|&s;elves to invade. The le&s;s hardy indeed wait for this felicity till overwearied nature &s;ets them free; but the more re&s;olved have recour&s;e even to &s;elf-violence, to force a &s;pee|dier pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>But it will be &s;till urged, that though what is called human happine&s;s be of &s;o fan|ta&s;tic a nature, that each man's imagination creates it for him&s;elf, yet human mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ry is more &s;ub&s;tantial and uniform throughout all the tribes of mankind. Now, from the wor&s;t of human mi&s;eries, the &s;avage <HI>Africans</HI> by the&s;e forced emigrations, are intirely &s;e|cured, &s;uch as the being perpetually hunted down like bea&s;ts of prey or profit, by their more &s;avage and powerful neighbours&mdash;In

truth, a ble&s;&s;ed change!&mdash;from being hunt|ed to being caught. But who are they that have &s;et on foot this general HUNTING? Are they not the&s;e very civilized vio|lators of humanity them&s;elves? who tempt the weak appetites, and provoke the wild pa&s;&s;ions of the fiercer &s;avages to prey upon the re&s;t."</P>
