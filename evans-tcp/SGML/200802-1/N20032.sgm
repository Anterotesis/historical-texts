<P>FINALLY, BRETHREN, FAREWEL: BE PERFECT; BE OF GOOD COMFORT; BE OF ONE MIND; LIVE IN PEACE; AND THE GOD OF LOVE AND PEACE SHALL BE WITH YOU.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE occa&s;ion, which has now brought us together, my beloved hearers, is one of the mo&s;t &s;olemn and affecting that can take place on this &s;ide eternity. The parting farewel be|tween a mini&s;ter and people, who have been long connected in the bonds of &s;o endearing and hap|py a union, is like tearing a&s;under the &s;trings which twine around our hearts. But as it is now determined, that we mu&s;t &s;oon part from each other, let us endeavor to fortify our minds for the trying &s;cene; that we may, by divine grace, en|dure and improve the pangs of &s;eparation, in a manner becoming our character as men, and our profe&s;&s;ion as chri&s;tians.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="026243_0004_0FCFAABBD391B460">I know of no pa&s;&s;age in the whole book of God, which is better adapted to &s;uch an occa&s;ion, than the words ju&s;t read; in which, the Apo&s;tle Paul, who had been a religious in&s;tructor and &s;piritual father to the Corinthians, clo&s;es his epi&s;|tle to them with an affectionate and &s;olemn fare|wel; every word of which is full of pathos and energy; and the whole &s;entence mo&s;t powerfully calculated to excite, direct, and encourage them to a right temper and behaviour in their pre&s;ent &s;ituation. <HI>Finally, Brethren, farewel: Be per|fect; be of good comfort; be of one mind; live in peace; and the God of love and peace &s;hall be with you.</HI></P>
<P>It &s;hall be the bu&s;ine&s;s of this di&s;cour&s;e to ex|plain the meaning of the &s;everal branches of this valedictory exhortation, and to apply the &s;ubject to the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t clau&s;e in the text, <HI>Brethren farewel,</HI> requires very little illu&s;tration. It is a common expre&s;&s;ion of kindne&s;s, or mode of civility, by which acquaintance and friends take their leave of each other; and it imports a hearty de&s;ire of the welfare of tho&s;e to whom it is addre&s;&s;ed. The
<PB N="7" REF="026243_0005_0FCFAABA5FECB2F0">
very formation of the word holds up this idea. It is compounded of <HI>fare</HI> and <HI>well;</HI> and there|fore the u&s;e of it, on occa&s;ion of parting with our friends, evidently expre&s;&s;es a wi&s;h, that they may <HI>fare well</HI> in our ab&s;ence, or enjoy the &s;weets of health and pro&s;perity. When it is u&s;ed by <HI>chri&s;|tian</HI> friends, it implies a devout wi&s;h of each oth|er's &s;piritual welfare. This was undoubtedly the leading &s;entiment of the Apo&s;tle, when he took this affectionate leave of his &s;piritual children of Corinth. In order to attain this de&s;ired end, their &s;piritual pro&s;perity, he proceeds to direct and urge them to &s;everal important and &s;ea&s;onable duties.</P>
<P>He, fir&s;t, exhorts them to <HI>be perfect.</HI> This may be con&s;idered as pointing out the duty of each par|ticular member, or of the &s;ociety at large. Fir&s;t, let each member of the church be <HI>perfect,</HI> by ex|amining and correcting his own errors, filling up his own defects, pu&s;hing forward and completing his own graces and virtues. Let every one look to him&s;elf, that he be evangelically perfect, or &s;in|cere and impartial, in his regard to truth and du|ty; that he have his head and heart, his profe&s;&s;i|on and practice, as nearly conformed as po&s;&s;ible to the great patern and rule of perfection. This
<PB N="8" REF="026243_0006_0FCFAAB881031050">
is the &s;ure, the only method to reform and perfect the whole &s;ociety: This is the way to have a pure and glorious church. Which leads to the other idea; <HI>be perfect</HI> in your collective capacity as a chri&s;tian &s;ociety. In order to this, return to your former pure, united and happy &s;tate. Revive that mutual chri&s;tian charity which is the bond of per|fection; which, like the joints, veins and arte|ries of the natural body, conveys nouri&s;hment and vigour, unity and perfection, to the whole church or &s;piritual body of Chri&s;t; which draws the affections and efforts of all the members to one point, the edification and completion of the whole. In one word, grow in divine love, in ho|ly affection to Chri&s;t your Head, and to one ano|ther for his &s;ake. This will at once perfect your character as individuals, and complete the union, beauty and happine&s;s of your &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Be of good comfort:</HI> that is, in the way of earne&s;t endeavors after reformation and chri&s;tian perfection, take the courage and com|fort, which a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of your own &s;incerity, and the a&s;&s;urance of the divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance and ble&s;|&s;ing, ought to in&s;pire. Let no pre&s;ent or apprehend|ed difficulties or dangers, attending your &s;ituation,
<PB N="9" REF="026243_0007_0FCF8B90A7268988">
be permitted to overwhelm your minds. Remem|ber that the way of duty is the road of &s;afety; that God is with you, while you are with Him; and that &s;o long as you keep in this path, he &s;tands engaged, by promi&s;e, to guide, protect, and pro&s;per you.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>Be of one mind.</HI> The import of the original is, think, mind, or reli&s;h the &s;ame thing. It may, therefore, include a union or harmony of &s;entiment, affection and practice. Fir&s;t, it implies a union of &s;entiment re&s;pecting the great e&s;&s;en|tials of religion, tho&s;e which con&s;titute or exhib|it the foundation of the &s;inner's hope, the nece&s;&s;ary cau&s;es, conditions, or means of &s;alvation. I grant there is an ab&s;urdity in exhorting or requiring all men to think alike in every punctilio of reli|gious opinion. For in the pre&s;ent imperfect &s;tate, many things operate to hinder even wi&s;e and good men from adopting the &s;ame modes of thought and expre&s;&s;ion on every religious &s;ubject. Be&s;ides, a union of &s;entiment among rational beings, is not to be effected by authoritative precept or pathe|tic exhortation; much le&s;s by violent or compul|&s;ory mea&s;ures; but by convincing light or evi|dence pre&s;ented to their under&s;tandings. But
<PB N="10" REF="026243_0008_0FCFAAB38EFDE018">
&s;till, when &s;ufficient means of light are afforded to men (which is the ca&s;e with tho&s;e who enjoy the go&s;pel, with re&s;pect to every important arti|cle of faith and duty) they may be properly re|quired to think the &s;ame thing; that is, to em|brace and hold fa&s;t the &s;ame e&s;&s;ential points; at lea&s;t to adhere to the &s;ub&s;tance, the &s;pirit, the practical de&s;ign of the&s;e truths, though they &s;hould differ in &s;ome &s;peculative niceties in the mode of &s;tating or explaining them. A total re|jection of any plain and important doctrine of chri&s;tianity, under &s;ufficient means of light, is ve|ry criminal and dangerous. For it proclaims an unfair and di&s;hone&s;t, a wilfully blind and deprav|ed heart. In &s;hort, if it be the duty of the mem|bers of a religious &s;ociety, to love the truth, to harmonize with it in their governing ta&s;te and di&s;po&s;ition, to keep their minds ever open and at|tentive to the evidence of it, and eager to em|brace it whenever duly pre&s;ented; and if right views of religion are important to right temper and practice; if go&s;pel truths admitted into the mind are the foundation of go&s;pel holine&s;s in the heart and life; and if the united adherence of a chri&s;tian church to the&s;e truths is an important mean of pre&s;erving and increa&s;ing true godline&s;s,
<PB N="11" REF="026243_0009_0FCFAAB2C415FD70">
charity and peace in the &s;ociety; then it is a ve|ry important duty in the members of &s;uch a &s;ocie|ty, carefully to maintain truth and unanimity in their religious principles. In order to this, it becomes them with united diligence, impartiality and zeal, to attend to the word of God, as the great fountain of orthodoxy, and the true center of chri&s;tian unity.</P>
<P>But &s;econdly, the precept before us includes <HI>union of affection.</HI> As if it had been &s;aid, let your hearts be one in chri&s;tian love, though about matters of le&s;s moment your opinions and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> be divided. This is evidently the meaning of the &s;ame original words in Romans 12.16.&mdash;and 15.5. <HI>Be of the &s;ame mind one toward another. Now the God of patience and con&s;olation grant you to be like-minded one towards another, that ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God. Wherefore re|ceive ye one another, as Chri&s;t al&s;o received us.</HI> The general &s;pirit of the&s;e texts is this: Though your religious ideas in &s;ome circum&s;tantial points be different; yet I de&s;ire and pray, that you may all have that mutual charity, which &s;hall form in you one mind and &s;oul, and influence you to ex|pre&s;s the &s;ame candour, e&s;teem, and beneficence towards one another, which each of you manife&s;ts and wi&s;hes for him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="026243_0010_0FCF8B8DAC5FAE20">In order to this, thirdly, be <HI>one in your practice,</HI> or pur&s;uit. Let vital practical chri&s;tianity, which is the principal thing, be the great object of your united attention and zeal; and let your agreement in this be an effectual band of union and fellow|&s;hip among all the members of your &s;ociety. Such a harmony of practical judgment and holy activity on the &s;ide of the chri&s;tian cau&s;e, is a much better foundation for mutual charity, and is far more conducive to the edification and glory of a church, than the mo&s;t zealous and united attach|ment to orthodox opinions, where a corre&s;pondent union of practice is wanting, Agreeably, this &s;ame apo&s;tle, in the third chapter of his epi&s;tle to the Philippians, having related to them his own views and exerci&s;es, having told them, <HI>this one thing I do&mdash;I pre&s;s towards the mark of perfect ho|line&s;s, for the prize of eternal life,</HI> proceeds to urge them to a united pur&s;uit of the &s;ame cour&s;e. <HI>Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: And if in any thing ye be otherwi&s;e minded, God &s;hall reveal even this unto you. Neverthele&s;s, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the &s;ame rule; let us mind the &s;ame thing.</HI> As if he had &s;aid, we have all attained to this great point, to &s;et up Chri&s;t, holine&s;s and heaven, as our mark
<PB N="13" REF="026243_0011_0FCFAAAFD64FF5B8">
and our all. Let it, then&punc; be our main con|cern, to walk by this rule, to mind this one thing: And if in any le&s;&s;er matter you have a diver&s;ity of &s;entiment, you mu&s;t candidly bear with one another, and patiently wait and hope for the time when God &s;hall give you a better and united un|der&s;tanding in the&s;e controverted points. In the mean-time, let us go hand in hand; let us join all our forces together, in promoting the&s;e great and weightier things in which we <HI>are</HI> agreed, in build|ing up the kingdom of our common Lord&punc; which con&s;i&s;ts, not in meat and drink, but in righteou&s;|ne&s;s, peace, and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>But this brings us to the next clau&s;e of the text,</P>
<P><HI>Live in peace.</HI> Let each one cultivate a pacif|ic temper in his own brea&s;t: let him manife&s;t it in his whole deportment: let him labor to the utmo&s;t to diffu&s;e and promote it through the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">|ety. Let all the members endeavor to introduce and maintain that chri&s;tian concord, which grows out of a union of &s;entiment, affection and practice in the cau&s;e of pure, vital and &s;aying religion. In order to this, let each one mortify and guard again&s;t tho&s;e corrupt pa&s;&s;ions in his own heart,
<PB N="14" REF="026243_0012_0FCFAAAE4AC71438">
which tend to di&s;turb the peace, and to kindle the flame of contention; &s;uch as pride, &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, anger, envy, a &s;pirit of party, of jealou&s;y and pre|judice. Let every one religiou&s;ly ab&s;tain from all unfriendly, injurious, provoking language or behaviour. Let each one &s;ee that his own heart be formed to a truly kind, meek, and humble di&s;|po&s;ition, to a temper of &s;upreme love to God, and cordial benevolence to his neighbour. This will make it ea&s;y to deny our&s;elves, our own intere&s;ts and wills, for the peace and edification of our bre|thren&punc; This will prompt a gentle deportment towards all. This will make it our &s;tudious and delightful employment to contrive, to advi&s;e, to pro&s;ecute the things which make for peace; to u&s;e the be&s;t methods for reconciling differences, for healing divi&s;ions, for &s;tilling tumults, for advan|cing chri&s;tian love and harmony. This will make it ea&s;y to ob&s;erve the fair and equitable rules pre|&s;cribed by our Saviour, for re&s;toring peace be|tween our&s;elves and others, whenever it has been interrupted by any real or &s;uppo&s;ed offence, either on our part, or on theirs. When the members of a chri&s;tian &s;ociety habitually profe&s;s and che|ri&s;h this &s;pirit, and pur&s;ue this train of conduct, they live in peace, in the true and noble &s;en&s;e of our text.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="026243_0013_0FCFAAACDF9B08B0">The remaining part of the ver&s;e enforces our compliance with the preceding directions, by a mo&s;t encouraging and glorious motive; <HI>And the God of love and peace &s;hall be with you.</HI> The Supreme Being is &s;tiled the God of love and peace, becau&s;e he is the prime &s;ource, the perfect exemplar, and the great patron of them. Love and peace con&s;titute the beauty and felicity of his own nature: they are the native element in which he dwells. He has eminently di&s;played the&s;e qualities in his works; e&s;pecially in that of redemption, which is at once an a&s;toni&s;hing mani|fe&s;tation of love, and an unparalleled &s;cheme of reconciliation and peace. Agreeably, love and peace are the &s;pirit and breath of the go&s;pel, of its doctrines, precepts, examples, motives, and be|nefits. They are peculiarly congenial to the na|ture and undertaking, the re&s;pective offices and works of God's Son and Spirit, the con&s;tituted Redeemer and Sanctifier of men. On the&s;e ac|counts the Mo&s;t High is properly and emphati|cally called the God of love and peace. As &s;uch, he mu&s;t approve and delight in the&s;e qualities in his creatures: He mu&s;t take complacency in them, both as his own production and his own image. Tho&s;e, therefore, who po&s;&s;e&s;s the&s;e vir|tues,
<PB N="16" REF="026243_0014_0FCF8B8C30160348">
have all po&s;&s;ible &s;ecurity of the &s;pecial pre|&s;ence and everla&s;ting favour of the Almighty: For he can no more di&s;regard his own image, than he can deny him&s;elf.</P>
<P>What noble encouragement is here for a people &s;tudiou&s;ly to practi&s;e the duties here enjoined; and what a &s;ource of comfort to tho&s;e who are found pur&s;uing this path! To be the con&s;cious favorites of the infinite God! to be &s;ure of his gracious pre&s;ence &s;tatedly re&s;iding among them, as the pillar and the Schekinah did with his ancient I&s;rael, to guide, protect, invigorate and comfort them! to walk daily in the light of his approving, &s;miling countenance! to be vi&s;ited with tokens of his love in frequent &s;howers of temporal and &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings, like the refre&s;hing dews on the ancient mountains of Hermon and Zion, where the Lord commanded the ble&s;&s;ing, even life forevermore! Surely happy is the peo|ple that is in &s;uch a ca&s;e; yea, happy is the peo|ple who&s;e God is the Lord!</P>
<P>And now, what greater happine&s;s can I wi&s;h for you, my beloved friends of this &s;ociety, than that you may unitedly follow the directions, and in|herit the promi&s;e of this excellent text! How
<PB N="17" REF="026243_0015_0FCFAAABA506A340">
would it &s;ooth the angui&s;h of my heart in parting with you, if I had the plea&s;ing a&s;&s;urance that the God of love and peace would &s;tatedly re&s;ide among you! It gives me un&s;peakable joy to find <HI>&s;o much</HI> of a prudent, pacific, conde&s;cending &s;pirit reigning among you at this critical juncture. I rejoice to hear that this &s;pirit appeared in your meeting &s;ometime &s;ince for &s;upplying the Desk; that it vi&s;ibly guided your election of a committee for that purpo&s;e; and that the members of this com|mittee in general, are engaged in di&s;charging their important tru&s;t, in &s;o united, di&s;creet and faithful a manner. So far as I can learn, there &s;eems to be a general di&s;po&s;ition both in them, and in the &s;ociety at large, to forget the things which are behind, to throw the mantle of charitable ob|livion over any differences of opinion, or infirmi|ties of temper and expre&s;&s;ion, which may have taken place during the late &s;cene of trial and temp|tation. With regard to my&s;elf, I feel that I am con&s;tantly &s;ubject to imperfections; and it is pro|bable that many of you have witne&s;&s;ed more or le&s;s of infirmity in &s;ome of my language or de|portment, in managing the late very delicate and intere&s;ting affair between you and me. So far as this has been the ca&s;e, I publicly ask that candor
<PB N="18" REF="026243_0016_0FCF8B8A09A14560">
and forgivene&s;s, which I am ready, in return, to exerci&s;e towards any &s;imilar imperfections in you. But as to the main part which I have acted, and the leading motives which have influenced me in this great bu&s;ine&s;s, you will allow me to leave with you this &s;olemn parting declaration; a declara|tion which, I think, I could confidently make, if I were now addre&s;&s;ing you from my dying bed:&mdash;I &s;olemnly declare, that my acceptance of the re&s;ult of the late Council, and of the invitation of the College, proceeded, not from any want of affec|tion to my people, or of a deep &s;en&s;e of my for|mer &s;acred engagements to them; not from an inordinate de&s;ire of worldly &s;plendor or wealth, ea&s;e or gratification; but from a clear conviction of con&s;cience, that the &s;ame King of Zion, who formerly placed me in this part of his dominions, now called me to a different and more important department in the &s;ame great moral kingdom. And I feel great comfort in the thought, that this glorious King, who will &s;hortly be my Judge, has &s;een all the inward &s;prings, and leading &s;teps of my conduct, in the whole proce&s;s of this tran&s;action; in particular, that he is my witne&s;s, that I did not form my judgment on this great que&s;tion in a blind, ha&s;ty, &s;elf-&s;ufficient manner; but threw my
<PB N="19" REF="026243_0017_0FCFAAA965FCD2B0">
mind open to every ray of light from every quar|ter, &s;ought the be&s;t directions both from Heaven and Earth, and exerci&s;ed a patient, candid and mature deliberation on the &s;ubject for a &s;eries of months. It al&s;o gives me comfort that the &s;ame Omni&s;cient Being knows the fal&s;ehood of &s;ome re|ports, which ignorance, prejudice or pa&s;&s;ion have circulated; &s;uch as, that I &s;ought the new &s;tation to which I am cho&s;en; that I &s;ecretly acted in concert with &s;ome of the Electors, and al&s;o with the late Council previou&s;ly to their re&s;ult: The rever&s;e of which all tho&s;e gentlemen know to be the truth. The&s;e facts, connected with the re|markable unanimity of both tho&s;e very re&s;pectable bodies, greatly &s;upport my &s;pirits in this trying, parting &s;cene. I mention them in this &s;olemn manner, at this affecting moment, hoping they may leave a favorable impre&s;&s;ion on the minds of &s;ome of the Brethren of this Church, who&s;e judg|ment on the final que&s;tion differed from my own. I confe&s;s it would be a very comfortable circum|&s;tance to me, to go from you in a &s;tate of entire mutual charity and union with all my former friends in this place. The more united you are in &s;entiment and feelings re&s;pecting your late Pa&s;|tor and his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from you, the more fair and
<PB N="20" REF="026243_0018_0FCF8B886E300538">
encouraging will be the pro&s;pect of entire affec|tion and unanimity in year future proceedings. It is chiefly on this account that I have touched on this delicate &s;tring. I have not felt, nor meant to expre&s;s any anxiety for my own reputation; for I ble&s;s God that I do not find <HI>this</HI> has &s;uffered by the late tran&s;actions: Much le&s;s have I intend|ed publicly to boa&s;t of my own conduct and mo|tives, or to reflect blame upon tho&s;e who have thought and acted in a different manner. For the former character and friend&s;hip of my di&s;&s;enting Brethren both in Church and Pari&s;h, have in gen|eral been &s;uch, as to entitle them to my e&s;teem and grateful remembrance. Therefore, without making any invidious di&s;tinctions, let me affec|tionately apply the &s;ubject to all.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, my friends, &s;tudy to <HI>be perfect.</HI> Let each individual rectify what is ami&s;s in his own temper and conduct; and then let him labor to reform, to edify and to perfect the whole body, of which he is member. While you are thus en|gaged, <HI>be of good comfort.</HI> Though a dark cloud &s;hould long hang over your affairs, yet in the way of duty, cheerfully and re&s;olutely tru&s;t in Him, who is Head over all things to his Church.

Remem|ber there have been in&s;tances of agreeable pulpit gifts and fervor, yea, of excellent evangelical di&s;|cour&s;es, where there has been but little &s;olid judg|ment or &s;ound knowledge and learning; or where the private character of the preachers has been very imprudent, un&s;table and vain, yea, perhaps directly immoral; or where dangerous principles have been artfully concealed or varni&s;hed, until the &s;peakers have gained a large and firm intere&s;t in the people's affections, or have &s;ecured a good &s;et|tlement among them; and then they have a&s;&s;um|ed courage to bring forward their obnoxious pecu|liarities. The&s;e notorious facts admoni&s;h you, my friends, to exerci&s;e the greate&s;t care and circum|&s;pection in the trial of candidates; and in particu|lar, to in&s;i&s;t upon authentic written te&s;timonials from &s;ome approved mini&s;ters, in favor of &s;uch as come to you from any di&s;tant part of the country.
<PB N="22" REF="026243_0020_0FCFAAA2B34A7E40">
Let me further entreat you, in your probation of preachers, to direct your principal attention to the <HI>matter</HI> of their di&s;cour&s;es, and to compare this, to|gether with their private conver&s;ation and deport|ment, with the form of &s;ound words contained in the bible, and with the &s;criptural characters of a good mini&s;ter or go&s;pel bi&s;hop. If you find, on &s;uch examination, that you have a candidate, who in a good mea&s;ure comes up to this &s;tandard, be ready with one mind to embrace him. Let not an unbounded de&s;ire of novelty, or an over-nice and difficult ta&s;te, or any con&s;ideration of mere fancy prevent you from peaceably uniting in the choice of &s;uch a preacher.</P>
<P>But though you &s;hould not agree in every punctilio re&s;pecting either preachers or doctrines, yet be of one mind, with regard to mutual chri&s;|tian affection. In order to keep alive this union, be very cautious again&s;t &s;plitting into parties, and &s;etting up particular favorite preachers at the head of &s;everal contending factions. In &s;hort, let your united zeal be mainly employed in reviving and promoting the power and practice of true godline&s;s in your&s;elves and in one another. Be of one mind in this great cau&s;e, in which all good
<PB N="23" REF="026243_0021_0FCF8B86E1899A10">
men are agreed. This will divert your zeal from tho&s;e le&s;&s;er matters, which are &s;o apt to divide chri&s;tian brethren: It will operate as a powerful cement of chri&s;tian union and fellow&s;hip; and it will happily conduce to rectify and harmonize your &s;entiments upon all matters of importance, For if any man or body of men will do his will, they &s;hall know of the doctrine whether it be of God.</P>
<P>Finally, &s;tudy <HI>to live in peace.</HI> Extingui&s;h and forever bury every thing, which might tend to blow up the coal of di&s;cord. Think and &s;peak of nothing but what may conduce to &s;weeten your minds and &s;trengthen the cords of unity. Sacri|fice to peace every thing but e&s;&s;ential truth and duty. Abhor the thought of making chri&s;tianity it&s;elf a ball of contention; of quarrelling about the hou&s;e, or the preachers, the doctrines or in&s;ti|tutions of that religion, which breathes nothing but love and peace, which was wholly intended to make men one with each other, and with their God. Think how incon&s;i&s;tent and mon&s;trous a &s;pectacle this would be! Think, on the other hand, of the beauty, the plea&s;ure, the advantages of chri&s;tian concord! How does it embalm the
<PB N="24" REF="026243_0022_0FCFAAA01B875D00">
name, and recommend the character of a religious &s;ociety! What an alluring charm does it pre&s;ent to preachers of the be&s;t de&s;cription to come a|mong &s;uch a people, and to breathe in their frag|rant and delightful atmo&s;phere! How does it cement, invigorate, and fortify them, like a build|ing or a city that is firmly compacted together! Above all, how does it a&s;&s;imilate them to the God of love and peace, engage his directing and com|forting pre&s;ence with them, and ripen them for his heavenly kingdom, that region of pure, con|&s;ummate, everla&s;ting friend&s;hip and peace!</P>
<P>Some of the motives, now &s;ugge&s;ted, ought to have peculiar weight with <HI>this</HI> flock. For you, my brethren, know, by long experience, the value and &s;weetne&s;s of a united and peaceful &s;tate, and have enjoyed a di&s;tingui&s;hed reputation on this account, through the whole vicinity. I hope, therefore, none of you will lightly throw away &s;o precious a jewel. If by lo&s;ing your Pa&s;tor, you &s;hould lo&s;e the ornament of brotherly affection and unity, will not the &s;urrounding world be apt to a&s;cribe your former harmony and peace, not to any real prudence or goodne&s;s in you, but to &s;ome other cau&s;e; and will they not rea&s;onably
<PB N="25" REF="026243_0023_0FCF8B85751DA030">
conclude, that a people who had been &s;o long and &s;o clo&s;ely linked together, need not, and would not have broken in pieces, had it not been for their own criminal inattention, folly, or perver&s;e|ne&s;s! I hope and pray that your future conduct may be &s;uch, as to give no occa&s;ion for &s;uch un|favorable remarks.</P>
<P>I cannot prevail upon my&s;elf to clo&s;e, without &s;ome more particular addre&s;&s;es, &s;uited to the &s;ub|ject and occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, let me direct my brotherly and chri&s;tian farewel to the members of this church. It is with a mournful plea&s;ure that my mind runs over the many &s;olemn and endearing &s;cenes, in which you and I have been jointly concerned, during my pa&s;toral connexion with you. A great part of the members of this church, who were active in my &s;ettlement here, are now fallen a&s;leep. But our eccle&s;ia&s;tical records give us the comforting information, that &s;ince that date a much larger number has been added to the church, than death has taken from it. Let us, my beloved Brethren and Si&s;ters, look back, on this affecting occa&s;ion, to the many weekly Sabbaths and monthly Sa|craments, which have rolled over us during that
<PB N="26" REF="026243_0024_0FCFAA9DCA771B90">
long period; and if you have formerly attended my mini&s;trations in the &s;anctuary or at the table of the Lord, with any &s;piritual delight or advan|tage, thankfully a&s;cribe the glory to God, and favor the unworthy in&s;trument with your good wi&s;hes and prayers. However your judgments may dif|fer re&s;pecting the lately decided que&s;tion of my removal, yet &s;o far as you have the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, your profe&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter, you will certainly feel di&s;|po&s;ed tenderly to pity and pray for one who has been intimately united to you &s;o many years, and to be&s;eech the great Fountain of wi&s;dom and grace to give him a right di&s;cernment of his duty, and a hearty practical conformity to it, and to aid and pro&s;per him in all his laudable views and pur&s;uits. Such prayers I &s;hall e&s;teem a precious token of your chri&s;tian love; and &s;hall not fail to return them, &s;o long as my powers of thought, affection, or utterance remain. In the mean time, permit me to leave with you one word of brotherly coun&s;el and admonition. Remember your high and holy profe&s;&s;ion. Think how many eyes are upon you. Con&s;ider how much the credit and intere&s;t of religion in this place, and among your own po&s;terity, will, under God, depend up|on you. To you it belongs to lead in the re&s;et|tlement
<PB N="27" REF="026243_0025_0FCFAA9C78398E00">
of the go&s;pel mini&s;try and ordinances in this Society. Let me then conjure you by all that is &s;acred, to go before the congregation in a pru|dent, meek, conde&s;cending, exemplary deport|ment. In taking my leave of this church, I bid farewel to that &s;acred table, where I have &s;o often &s;tood and admini&s;tered the ble&s;&s;ed memorials of my Redeemer's dying love. It is very unlikely that we, who have &s;urrounded that divine board, &s;hall all meet again in that ordinance here below. Let us then part with a &s;olemn re&s;olution of &s;tand|ing ready to meet each other at the marriage &s;up|per of the Lamb, where we &s;hall eat bread and drink wine new with our heavenly Bridegroom, in his Father's kingdom.</P>
<P>Let me now addre&s;s &s;everal cla&s;&s;es of per&s;ons in the Congregation. Fir&s;t, tho&s;e of you who are <HI>heads of families</HI> will accept my be&s;t ac|knowledgments for the re&s;pect and ho&s;pitality, with which you have ever received me at your hou&s;es; and will permit me to bring to your re|collection the &s;olemn &s;cenes of &s;ickne&s;s and mourning, which have called me to mo&s;t of your habitations during my mini&s;terial relation to you; and to inquire how you have improved the&s;e af|fecting
<PB N="28" REF="026243_0026_0FCF8B840055CCD8">
admonitions. I mu&s;t al&s;o ask you, how you have entertained the many coun&s;els and warn|ings I have given you on the important &s;ubject of family-wor&s;hip, in&s;truction and government. What a happine&s;s &s;hould I e&s;teem it, to be able to leave you with the agreeable a&s;&s;urance, that each of your hou&s;es contained an altar to Jehovah, and a nur&s;ery for Heaven! I be&s;eech tho&s;e of you, who have re&s;i&s;ted all former pre&s;&s;ing calls to the&s;e great dome&s;tic duties, to revolve the &s;ubject once more in your &s;erious deliberation, and to ask your&s;elves, how you will meet the eye of your Judge, and of your poor neglected chil|dren, in the day of retribution. I entreat &s;uch as have hitherto neglected the bapti&s;mal dedication of their offspring to God, to con&s;ider whether their excu&s;es for this omi&s;&s;ion will bear the &s;cru|tiny of the final judgment. I once more call upon tho&s;e, who, having vi&s;ibly devoted them&s;elves and their hou&s;es to God, yet neglect a religious care both of them&s;elves and their baptized off|&s;pring, or do not &s;eriou&s;ly pre&s;s forward, agreea|bly to their &s;olemn vows, towards the mark of complete preparation for, and attendance on all divine in&s;titutions: I beg &s;uch to realize how they will account at la&s;t for this incon&s;i&s;tent con|duct;
<PB N="29" REF="026243_0027_0FCFAA98A83DE910">
or how they can expect to be owned as Chri&s;t's friends, when they have not been careful to do what&s;oever he has commanded.</P>
<P>You, who are heads of families in this place, will remember, that the removal of your Pa&s;tor leaves a double weight of duty upon you. To you it belongs to &s;upply, as far as po&s;&s;ible, the want of a public Shepherd, by taking &s;pecial care of the Lambs of the flock; by admini&s;tering to them the be&s;t per&s;onal in&s;truction and di&s;ci|pline; by providing for them the be&s;t &s;chools of education, and by endeavouring to the utmo&s;t to guard them again&s;t tho&s;e evils, which are too apt to &s;pring-up in the &s;oil of a de&s;titute Pari&s;h, at lea&s;t among the young and unthinking; I mean more e&s;pecially a &s;pirit of indifference, forgetful|ne&s;s and contempt re&s;pecting religion in general; particularly the Sabbath and its public &s;olemni|ties, or the preachers and mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel; or el&s;e an itching, un&s;ettled, di&s;tracted habit, in reference to the&s;e matters. The&s;e evils will be more l<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ely to infect the ri&s;ing generation, if their parents and &s;uperiors countenance them by their example. I hope therefore, that every governor of a family here, will be peculiarly watchful over his own lips and actions, from a tender regard to
<PB N="30" REF="026243_0028_0FCF8B830A03D7C0">
the many children and youth of this flock, as well as to the general order and peace of the Society.</P>
<P>Secondly, I now turn my&s;elf to the <HI>younger part</HI> of the congregation. I want words, my dear young friends to expre&s;s my tender feelings for you at this affecting moment. My mind flies back to tho&s;e &s;olemn and endearing &s;ea&s;ons, when I publicly admini&s;tered to many of you the ordinance of bapti&s;m; called over you the &s;acred name of the Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t, and &s;et you apart to be God's children. The yearly catechizing &s;ea&s;ons too, in which I have with plea|&s;ure attempted to convey divine knowledge and pious impre&s;&s;ions into your opening minds; the&s;e ru&s;h with peculiar force upon my memory and heart. And now, what can I &s;ay to you in this farewel addre&s;s, but what I have often repeated both in public and private? Remember your Cre|ator and Redeemer in the golden days of your youth: Reverence his name, his wor&s;hip, his &s;ab|baths, his mini&s;ters: Honor and obey your par|ents and teachers: Flee all youthful lu&s;ts and vanities: Pray and give thanks to God every day for your daily mercies; and e&s;pecially, pray earne&s;tly that God would give you another mini&s;|ter,
<PB N="31" REF="026243_0029_0FCFAA928EDFA5D0">
much better and more &s;ucce&s;sful than he has been, who is about to leave you. At the &s;ame time be a&s;&s;ured, that your late Pa&s;tor leaves you, not becau&s;e he does not love you; but becau&s;e he thinks his Ma&s;ter calls him to a place where he may do much greater good&punc; I hope, therefore, you will &s;till love him, and pray for his pro&s;peri|ty; and al&s;o continue to love and re&s;pect all the worthy mini&s;ters around you. Let me particular|ly caution you again&s;t di&s;affection to tho&s;e mini&s;|ters who have advi&s;ed my di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from you. Though their judgment in this in&s;tance cro&s;&s;es your feelings, yet you will always find them your faithful friends. If you treat them, and all preachers of good character with re&s;pect, this will have great influence to encourage &s;ome ex|cellent man to come and &s;ettle among you as your Pa&s;tor. And let me remind you, my dear youths, that your own intere&s;t for time and eternity, pe|culiarly depends upon your obtaining &s;uch a mini&s;|ter. Finally, it will always give me great joy to hear that the children of this beloved &s;ociety are walking in the truth. I &s;hall ever welcome any of you or your parents, as vi&s;itants to my new habitation; and &s;hall take peculiar plea&s;ure in a&s;|&s;i&s;ting tho&s;e of you, who may repair to that &s;eat
<PB N="32" REF="026243_0030_0FCFAA9111273470">
of learning, with which I am connected, for a pub|lic education. And &s;ince I know not that I &s;hall ever addre&s;s you again, let me adopt and leave with you the parting, dying charge of David to his Son Solomon; <HI>And thou, Solomon my Son, know thou the God of thy Fathers, and &s;erve him with a perfect heart and a willing mind: If thou &s;eek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou for&s;ake him, he will ca&s;t thee off forever.</HI></P>
<P>I clo&s;e with taking my &s;olemn leave of tho&s;e two great cla&s;&s;es of people, into which this, and all our religious &s;ocieties are divided; I mean &s;inners and &s;aints, Tho&s;e of you, who belong to the former cla&s;s, have to this moment oppo&s;ed, in your hearts and practice, all the &s;olemn and affec|tionate in&s;tructions, warnings, entreaties, and per|&s;ua&s;ives, which have been u&s;ed by your late Pa&s;|tor and other Amba&s;&s;adors of Je&s;us: And though you have generally profe&s;&s;ed to e&s;teem and de|light in the public mini&s;trations which you have enjoyed in this place; yet they have only plea&s;ed your ears and your fancies, or at be&s;t made but a &s;uperficial and tran&s;ient impre&s;&s;ion upon your con&s;ciences and natural affections, without pro|ducing any hearty abiding love and obedience to
<PB N="33" REF="026243_0031_0FCF8B7F861CF4E8">
the truth. The thought of leaving any of you in &s;o melancholy a &s;ituation, is truly painful; e&s;|pecially when I look forward to that awful day, when you and your late mini&s;ter mu&s;t meet again at the tribunal of our common Judge. Then it will be known to all worlds how I have preached, and how you have heard and treated the me&s;&s;ages I brought you. If it &s;hall then appear that I have in the main (though I am &s;en&s;ible with very great and &s;inful imperfections) delivered and enforced the important &s;aving truths of the go&s;pel, what con&s;cious guilt, what &s;hivering horror mu&s;t &s;eize tho&s;e of you, who have ungratefully and finally rejected the&s;e truths; who have trampled under foot all the tender reiterated offers of infinite grace and everla&s;ting &s;alvation! With regard to &s;uch per&s;ons, every prayer, &s;ermon, exhortation, yea, every mean of religion which they have at any time attended and enjoyed, will be a fre&s;h witne&s;s again&s;t them, and fall like a weighty mill|&s;tone on their guilty heads! But, what a joy|full day, what a rapturous meeting will that be to tho&s;e of you, who have not only profe&s;&s;ed re|&s;pect and friend&s;hip for your late unworthy, &s;piritu|al guide, but have loved and obeyed the divine
<PB N="34" REF="026243_0032_0FCFAA8F8CA35230">
truths which he has imparted to you; have truly reli&s;hed and fed upon a preached go&s;pel, and have found it &s;weeter and more nouri&s;hing to your &s;piritual natures, than honey, or the honey-comb is to your animal. If I &s;hould be &s;o happy as to be found in the &s;ame cla&s;s with you in that day, how endearing, how tran&s;porting will be our in|terview! how complete our union and fellow&s;hip! how high will our mutual congratulations and thank&s;givings ri&s;e! If our affection to each other is &s;o great in this imperfect &s;tate; if the plea&s;ure of meeting together in religious and even civil communion has been &s;o &s;weet; what will be the friend&s;hip, the reciprocal endearments and joys be|tween a faithful mini&s;ter and his pious &s;aved people, in the world of perfect everla&s;ting love and en|joyment! O may the&s;e great ideas and pro&s;pects have their full effect both upon you and me! May they &s;ooth the angui&s;h of our pre&s;ent &s;epa|ration! May they rouze and con&s;train us all to an earne&s;t and growing preparation for a happy meet|ing at the right hand of our Judge!</P>
<P>Now may the God of peace, who brought again from the dead, our Lord Je&s;us, that great Shep|herd
