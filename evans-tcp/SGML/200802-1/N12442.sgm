<HEAD>PREFACE</HEAD>
<P>AS the occa&s;ion of this Poem was real, not fic|titious, &s;o the method pur&s;ued in it, was rather impo&s;ed, by what &s;pontaneou&s;ly aro&s;e in the Au|thor's mind, on that occa&s;ion, than meditated, or de&s;igned. Which will appear very probable from the nature of it. For it differs from the common mode of Poetry; which is, from long narrations to draw &s;hort morals. Here, on the contrary, the narrative is &s;hort, and the morality ari&s;ing from it makes the bulk of the Poem. The rea&s;on of it is, That the facts mentioned did naturally pour the&s;e moral reflections on the thought of the writer.</P>

<P>THESE, and &s;ome other quotations, I am proud to borrow from the Night-Thoughts e&s;pe|cially from Night the Fourth. In which, energy of language, &s;ublimity of &s;entiment, and the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite beauties of poetry, are the lea&s;t perfections to be admired. Almo&s;t every line glows with de|votion; ri&s;es into the mo&s;t exalted apprehen&s;ions of the adorable Redeemer; and is animated with the mo&s;t lively faith in his all-&s;ufficient mediation. The author of this excellent performance has the peculiar felicity, of ennobling all the &s;trength of &s;tyle, and every delicacy of imagination, with the grand and di&s;tingui&s;hing truths of Chri&s;tianity. The&s;e thoughts give the highe&s;t entertainment to the fancy, and impart the noble&s;t improvement to the mind. They not only refine our ta&s;te, but prepare us for death, and ripen us for glory. I never take up this admirable piece, but I am ready to cry out.&mdash;<HI>Tecun. vivere amem, tecum obeam libens;</HI> i. e. <Q>In&s;pire me with &s;uch a &s;pirit, and life &s;hall be delightful, nor death it&s;elf unwelcome.</Q></P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>FEW ages have been deeper in di&s;pute about religion, than this. The di&s;pute about religion, and the practice of it, &s;eldom go toge|ther. The &s;horter, therefore, the di&s;pute, the better. I think it may be reduced to this &s;ingle que&s;tion, <HI>Is Man Immortal,</HI> or is he not? If he is not, all our di&s;putes are mere amu&s;ements, or trials of &s;kill. In this ca&s;e, Truth, Rea&s;on, Religion, which give our Di&s;cour&s;es &s;uch pomp and &s;olemnity, are (as will be &s;hewn) mere empty &s;ounds, without any meaning in them. But if man is immortal, it will be|ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> him to be very &s;erious about eternal con&s;equences; or, in other Words, to be truly religious. And this great fundamental truth, une&s;tabli&s;hed, or unawaken'd in the minds of men, is, I conceive, the real &s;ource and &s;upport of all our infidelity; how remote &s;oever the particular objections advanced may &s;eem to be from it.</P>
<P>Sen&s;ible appearances affect mo&s;t men much more than ab&s;tract rea&s;onings; and we daily &s;ee bodies drop around us, but the &s;oul is invi&s;ible. The power which inclination has over the judgment, is greater than can be well conceived by tho&s;e that have not had an experience of it; and of what numbers is it the &s;ad intere&s;t, that &s;oul &s;hould not &s;urvive! The heathen world confe&s;&s;ed, that they rather hoped, than firmly believed immortality! and how many heathens have we &s;till among&s;t us! The &s;acred page a&s;&s;ures us, that life and immortality is brought to light by the go&s;pel: But by how many is the go&s;pel rejected, or overlooked! From the&s;e con&s;iderations, and from my being, accidentally, privy to the &s;entiments of &s;ome particular per&s;ons, I have been long per&s;uaded, that mo&s;t, if not all, our infidels (whatever name they take, and whatever &s;cheme, for argument's &s;ake, and to keep them&s;elves in countenance, they patronize) are &s;upport|ed in their deplorable error, by &s;ome doubt of their immortality, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the bottom. And I am &s;atisfied, that men once thoroughly convinced of their immortality, are not far from being Chri&s;tians. For it is hard to conceive, that a man fully con&s;cious eternal pain or happi|ne&s;s will certainly be his lot, &s;hould not earne&s;tly, and impartially, inquire after the &s;ure&s;t means of e&s;caping one, and &s;ecuring the other. And of &s;uch an earne&s;t and impartial inquiry, I well know the con|&s;equence.</P>
<P><PB REF="015714_0117_0F99E38F7B4D6198">
Here, therefore, in proof of this mo&s;t fundamental truth, &s;ome plain arguments are offered; arguments derived from principles which infidels admit in common with believers; arguments, which appear to me altogether irre&s;i&s;tible; and &s;uch as, I am &s;atisfied, will have great weight with all, who give them&s;elves the &s;mall trouble of looking &s;eriou&s;ly into their own bo&s;oms, and of ob&s;erving, with any tolerable degree of attention, what daily pa&s;&s;es round about them in the world. If &s;ome arguments &s;hall, Here, occur, which others have declined, they are &s;ubmitted, with all deference, to better judgments in this, of all points, the mo&s;t important. For, as to the being of a God, that is no longer di&s;puted; but it is undi&s;puted for this rea&s;on only, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Becau&s;e where the lea&s;t pretence to rea&s;on is admitted, it mu&s;t for ever be indi&s;putable. And of con&s;equence no man can be betrayed into a di&s;pute of that nature by vanity; which has a prin|cipal &s;hare in animating our modern combatants again&s;t other articles of our belief.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS we are at war with the power, it were well if we were at war with the manners, of France. A land of levity, is a land of guilt. A &s;erious mind is the native &s;oil of every virtue; and the &s;ingle charac|ter that does true honor to mankind. The &s;oul's immortality has been the favourite theme with the &s;erious of all ages. Nor is it &s;trange; it is a &s;ubject by far the mo&s;t intere&s;ting, and important, that can enter the mind of man. Of highe&s;t moment this &s;ubject always was, and always will be. Yet this its highe&s;t moment &s;eems to admit of increa&s;e, at this day; a &s;ort of occa&s;ional importance is &s;uperadded to the natural weight of it; if that opinion which is ad|vanced in the Preface to the preceding Night, be ju&s;t. It is there &s;uppo&s;ed, that all our infidels, whatever &s;cheme, for argument's &s;ake, and to keep them&s;elves in countenance, they patronize, are betray'd into their deplorable error, by &s;ome doubt of their immortality, at the bottom. And the more I con&s;ider this point, the more I am per|&s;uaded of the truth of that opinion. Tho' the di&s;tru&s;t of a futurity is a &s;trange error; yet it is an error into which bad men may naturally be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. For it is impo&s;&s;ible to bid defiance to final ruin, with|out &s;ome refuge in imagination, &s;ome pre&s;umption of e&s;cape. And what pre&s;umption is there? There are but two in nature; but two, within the compa&s;s of human thought. And the&s;e are,&mdash;That either God will not, or can not puni&s;h. Con&s;idering the divine attributes, the fir&s;t is too gro&s;s to be dige&s;ted by our &s;tronge&s;t wi&s;hes. And &s;ince omnipotence is as much a divine attribute as holine&s;s, that God cannot puni&s;h, is as ab&s;urd a &s;uppo&s;ition, as the former. God cer|tainly can puni&s;h, as long as the wicked man exi&s;ts. In non-exi&s;tence, therefore, is their only refuge; and, con&s;equently, non-exi&s;tence is their &s;tronge&s;t wi&s;h. And &s;trong wi&s;hes have a &s;trange influence on our opinions; they bias the judgment in a manner, almo&s;t, incredi|ble. And &s;ince on this member of their alternative, there are &s;ome very &s;mall appearances in their favour, and none at all on the other, they catch at this reed, they lay hold on this chimaera, to &s;ave them|&s;elves from the &s;hock, and horror, of an immediate, and ab&s;olute, de&s;pair.</P>
<P><PB REF="015714_0145_0F99E3ADDB626428">
On reviewing my &s;ubject, by the light which this argument, and others of like tendency, threw upon it, I was more inclin'd than ever, to pur&s;ue it; as it appeared to me to &s;trike directly at the main root of all our infidelity. In the following pages, it is, accordingly, pur|&s;ued at large; and &s;ome arguments for immortality, new (at lea&s;t, to me,) are ventured on in them. There al&s;o the writer has made an attempt to &s;et the gro&s;s ab&s;urdities and horrors of annihilation in a fuller and more affecting view, than is (I think) to be met with el&s;e|where.</P>
<P>The gentlemen, for who&s;e &s;ake this attempt was chiefly made, profe&s;s great admiration for the wi&s;dom of heathen antiquity: What pity 'tis, they are not &s;incere! If they were &s;incere, how would it mortify them to con&s;ider, with what contempt, and abhorrence, their notions would have been received, by tho&s;e whom they &s;o much ad|mire? What degree of contempt, and abhorrence, would fall to their &s;hare, may be conjectured by the following matter of fact (in my opinion) extremely memorable. Of all their heathen worthies, So|crates ('tis well known) was the mo&s;t guarded, di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate, and com|po&s;ed: Yet this great ma&s;ter of temper was angry; and angry at his la&s;t hour; and angry with his friend; and angry for what de&s;erv'd acknowledgment; angry, for a right and tender in&s;tance of true friend&s;hip towards him. Is not this &s;urpri&s;ing? What could be the cau&s;e? The cau&s;e was for his honour; it was a truly noble, tho', perhaps, a too punctilious, regard for immortality: For his friend a&s;king him, with &s;uch an affectionate concern as became a friend, <HI>Where he &s;hould depo&s;it his remains?</HI> it was re&s;ented by Socrates, as implying a di&s;honourable &s;uppo&s;ition, that He could be &s;o mean, as to have a regard for any thing, even in him&s;elf, that was not immortal.</P>
<P>This fact well con&s;ider'd, would make our infidels withdraw their admiration from Socrates; or make them endeavour, by their imita|tion of this illu&s;trious example, to &s;hare his glory: And, con&s;equently, It would incline them to peru&s;e the following pages with candor and impartiality: Which is all I de&s;ire; and that, for their &s;akes: For I am per&s;uaded, that an unprejudiced infidel mu&s;t, nece&s;&s;arily, receive &s;ome advantageous impre&s;&s;ions from them.</P>

Bi&s;hop <HI>Patrick</HI> &s;ays, its Grandeur is as much above all other Poetry, as Thunder is louder than a Whi&s;per. In order to &s;et this di&s;tingui&s;h'd Part of the Poem in a fuller Light, and give the Reader a clearer Conception of it, I have abridg'd the preceding and &s;ub&s;equent Parts of the Poem, and join'd them it; &s;o that this Piece is a &s;ort of an Epitome of the whole Book of <HI>Job.</HI></P>
<P>I u&s;e the Word <HI>Paraphra&s;e,</HI> becau&s;e I want another which might better an&s;wer to the uncommon Liberties I have taken. I have omitted, added, and tran&s;pos'd. The <HI>Mountain,</HI> the <HI>Comet,</HI> the <HI>Sun,</HI> and other Parts, are entirely added: The <HI>Peacock,</HI> the <HI>Lion,</HI> &amp;c are much inlarg'd: And I have thrown the Whole into a Method more &s;uitable to our Notions of Regularity. The judicious, if they compare this Piece with the Original, will, I flatter my&s;elf, find the Rea&s;ons for the great Liberties I have indulg'd my&s;elf in through the Whole.</P>
<P><HI>Longinus</HI> has a Chapter on Interrogations, which &s;hews that they contribute much to the Sublime. This Speech of the Almighty is made up of them. Interrogation &s;eems indeed the proper Style of Maje&s;ty incens'd. It differs from other manner of Reproof, as bid|ding a Per&s;on execute him&s;elf, does from a common Execution; for he that a&s;ks the Guilty a proper Que&s;tion, makes him, in effect, pa&s;s Sentence on him&s;elf.</P>

<P>The Book of <HI>Job</HI> is well known to be Dramatic, and, like the Tra|gedies

of old <HI>Greece,</HI> is Fiction built on Truth. Probably this mo&s;t noble Part of it, the Almighty &s;peaking out of the Whirlwind (&s;o &s;uitable to the After-practice of the <HI>Greek</HI> Stage. when there happened <HI>Dignus Vindice Nodus),</HI> is fictitious; but it is a Fiction more agreeable to the Time in which <HI>Job</HI> lived, than to any &s;ince.

<P>The like Spirit in the&s;e two Pa&s;&s;ages is no bad concurrent Argu|ment, that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> is Author of the Book of <HI>Job.</HI></P>

<L>Starve its devouring rage: the flakes a&s;pire,</L>
<L>And catch the clouds, and make the heavens their prey;</L>
<L>The Sun, the Moon, the Stars all melt away,</L>
<L>All, all is lo&s;t; no monument, no &s;ign,</L>
<L>Where once &s;o proudly blaz'd the gay machine.</L>
<L>So bubbles on the foaming &s;tream expire,</L>
<L>So &s;parks that &s;catter from the kindling fire;</L>
<L>The deva&s;tations of one dreadful hour,</L>
<L>The great Creator's &s;ix days work devour.</L>
<L>A mighty mighty ruin! yet one &s;oul</L>
<L>Has more to boa&s;t, and far outweighs the whole;</L>
<L>Exalted in &s;uperior excellence,</L>
<L>Ca&s;ts down to nothing &s;uch a va&s;t expence.</L>
<L>Have ye not &s;een th' eternal mountains nod,</L>
<L>An earth di&s;&s;olving, a de&s;cending GOD?</L>
<L>What &s;trange &s;urprizes through all nature ran?</L>
<L>For whom the&s;e revolutions, but for man?</L>
<L>For him Omnipotence new mea&s;ures takes;</L>
<L>For him through all eternity awakes;</L>
<L>Pours on him gifts &s;ufficient to &s;upply</L>
<L>Heav'n's lo&s;s, and with fre&s;h glories fill the &s;ky.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Think deeply then, O man, how great thou art,</L>
<L>Pay thy&s;elf homage with a trembling heart;</L>
<L>What angels guard, no longer dare neglect,</L>
<L>Slighting thy&s;elf, affront not GOD's re&s;pect:</L>
<L>Enter the &s;acred temple of thy brea&s;t,</L>
<L>And gaze, and wander there a ravi&s;h'd gue&s;t:</L>
<L>Gaze on tho&s;e hidden trea&s;ures thou &s;halt find,</L>
<L>Wander thro' all the glories of thy mind.</L>
<L>Of prefect knowledge, &s;ee, the dawning light</L>
<L>Foretels a noon mo&s;t exqui&s;itely bright!</L>
<L>Here &s;prings of endle&s;s joy are breaking forth!</L>
<L>There buds the promi&s;e of cele&s;tial worth!</L>
<L><PB N="357" REF="015714_0360_0F99E1CB4AC36AB8">
Worth which mu&s;t ripen in a happier clime</L>
<L>And brighter &s;un, beyond the bounds of time.</L>
<L>Thou, minor, can'&s;t not gue&s;s thy va&s;t e&s;tate,</L>
<L>What &s;tores on foreign coa&s;ts thy landing wait.</L>
<L>Lo&s;e not thy claim, let virtue's paths be trod;</L>
<L>Thus glad all heav'n, and plea&s;e that bounteous GOD;</L>
<L>Who, to light thee to plea&s;ures, hung on high</L>
<L>Yon radiant orb, proud regent of the &s;ky:</L>
<L>That &s;ervice done, its beams &s;hall fade away,</L>
<L>And GOD &s;hine forth in one eternal day.</L>
