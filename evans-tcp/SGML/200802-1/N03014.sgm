<HEAD>The Lu&s;ts of Men the Cau&s;e of Wars.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>James IV. I.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>From whence come Wars and Fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your Lu&s;ts that war in your Members?</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THERE is no one Subject that has taken up &s;o much Room in the many Hi&s;to|ries of the World in general, or of Na|tions in particular, as the Wars and Fightings that have been either among them&s;elves, or again&s;t one another. Nor has there any thing given Occa&s;ion for &s;o many Men to &s;ignalize them|&s;elves by their Conduct and Valour, and tran&s;mit their Names with Honour to future Generations, and even to the late&s;t Po&s;terity, as their remarka|ble Atchievements in Military Enterprizes.</P>
<P>But now in order to regulate our Apprehen&s;ions of war in general, and to judge when and how far it is lawful or unlawful; in order al&s;o to adju&s;t our Ideas of tho&s;e <HI>Men of War,</HI> who&s;e Names &s;ound great in Hi&s;tory, for their martial Genius and mighty Conque&s;ts; and to di&s;tingui&s;h between tho&s;e who have been famous for a generous Zeal, and an heroick Courage in maintaining and defending their ju&s;t Rights again&s;t their invading Foes, and tho&s;e who have been no le&s;s infamous for their Oppre&s;&s;ion and Violence, Tyranny and Cruelty:
<PB N="6" REF="003623_0004_10023536CF9F8AD0">
And la&s;tly, in order to our under&s;tanding with what Views any &s;hould be &s;eeking Military Skill, and with what Spirit they &s;hould enter upon and go forth to War; it is highly requi&s;ite to trace the Subject up to its Fountain Head, and con&s;ider the Origin of all the Wars and Fightings that are or have been in the World.</P>
<P>And here we &s;hall find that the World in its primitive Innocency and Perfection knew no &s;uch Thing. For the wi&s;e Creator of the Univer&s;e di&s;|po&s;ed every thing into &s;uch wonderful Order and exact Harmony, that there was not the lea&s;t Jar or Schi&s;m, nor the lea&s;t Oppo&s;ition or Di&s;cord in the natural or moral World.</P>
<P>And therefore it mu&s;t needs be our falling from the original Rectitude of our Nature, and the &s;uf|fering Sin and Lu&s;t to enter into our Hearts, that has given Birth to all the Contentions and Confu|&s;ions, the Wars and Blood&s;heds that have been among the Children of Men. And this is what the in&s;pired Author of this Epi&s;tle gives us an Ac|count, or at lea&s;t leads us into the Apprehen&s;ion of. <HI>From whence come Wars and Fightings among you? come they not hence even of your Lu&s;ts that war in your Members?</HI> This Epi&s;tle as you may &s;ee by the fir&s;t Ver&s;e of it, was directed to the Twelve Tribes that were &s;cattered abroad. And &s;uch was the Un|happine&s;s of of the <HI>I&s;raeliti&s;h</HI> Nation, that as they (thro their Pride by rea&s;on of their di&s;tingui&s;hing Privileges) de&s;pi&s;ed all other People; &s;o they were generally hated of tho&s;e among whom they came: and &s;eldom lived peaceably with them, or indeed one with another; but were continually at Vari|ance among them&s;elves, or quarrelling with their Nei'bours. And the&s;e Contentions and Quarrels being, as<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whitby in loc.</NOTE> <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> ob&s;erves, not only in <HI>Judea,</HI> but

in <HI>Alexandria, Syria,</HI> and many other Places, were doubtle&s;s the Cau&s;e of &s;etting the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire again&s;t them, to &s;uch a degree as brought on the dreadful De&s;truction of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Nation, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to have come upon them &s;even or eight Years after this Epi&s;tle was written.</P>
<P>But then if we con&s;ider this Epi&s;tle as directed to the Chri&s;tian <HI>Jews,</HI> yet they even after their Conver&s;ion retained too much of their old Temper, which threw them into many Conte&s;ts and Quar|rels about Matters of Religion, as well as tho&s;e of a civil Nature. And the Author of this Epi&s;tle ob&s;erving with Grief and great Concern of Soul, the unchri&s;tian Heats and Tumults which the&s;e Profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity did &s;o frequently fall into, is for leading them up to the Source and Ori|ginal of them, as the mo&s;t powerful Argument to di&s;courage and di&s;&s;wade them from &s;uch Broils and Quarrels for the future. <HI>From whence come Wars and Fightings among you? come they not hence even of your Lu&s;ts?</HI> He don't put the&s;e things by way of Interrogation, as if he was at a lo&s;s or uncertain whether they took their Original from hence or no, but we are to look upon it as an oratorical artful way of &s;peaking, that he might per&s;wade them into the &s;ame Apprehen&s;ion with him&s;elf, that all the Wars and Fightings that were among them aro&s;e from their Lu&s;ts, or <HI>their<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign"></NOTE> Plea&s;ures,</HI> as in the Margin, and which is ob&s;erved to be the mo&s;t common Signification of the Word; but then it mu&s;t be under&s;tood in this place of &s;uch Plea|&s;ures as ari&s;e from the Gratification of &s;ome Lu&s;t or other, and then it comes to the &s;ame thing with our Lu&s;ts. <HI>That war in your Members;</HI> i. e. in all the Faculties of our Nature, both of the Mind and
<PB N="8" REF="003623_0006_1002354A8EA89040">
of the Body; the<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>Leigh.</HI> Crit. Sac.</NOTE> Word as is ob&s;erved, bearing &s;uch an exten&s;ive Signification.</P>
<P>There are &s;piritual and fle&s;hly Lu&s;ts, and they all war in our Members, they militate one with ano|ther, and all of them again&s;t the Faculties of our Souls and the Members of our Bodies. And the&s;e Lu&s;ts that are thus at war within, the Apo&s;tle tells us are the Cau&s;e of all the Wars and Fightings that are without. Accordingly the&s;e are the two Points in the Text that I propo&s;e to &s;peak briefly to. <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>There are Lu&s;ts that war within us.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That the&s;e Lu&s;ts are the Cau&s;e of all the Wars and Fightings that are among the Children of Men.</HI></P>
<P>And then I intend to improve and apply the Truths, by which you will &s;ee that my Text coun|tenances the De&s;igns and Purpo&s;es of this Day, fur|ther than at fir&s;t View &s;ome of you may be appre|hen&s;ive of.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>There are Lu&s;ts that war within us.</HI></P>
<P>By <HI>Lu&s;ts</HI> we are to under&s;tand irregular Affec|tions and inordinate Appetites or De&s;ires. <HI>Lu&s;ts</HI> are not any new Affections or De&s;ires that differ in Nature from tho&s;e that were originally planted in our Con&s;titution. But when Men's natural Affecti|ons and Appetites are fixed upon improper Ob|jects, or carried out to an inordinate Degree, and the Gratification pur&s;ued in an irregular Manner, then they become LUSTS.</P>
<P>And by the Indulgence of one &s;uch Lu&s;t or in|ordinate De&s;ire in our fir&s;t Parents, their Souls were betrayed, and a multitude of them brake in im|mediately, and got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Nature; and &s;o intimately united with their Con&s;titutions, as to
<PB N="9" REF="003623_0007_10023524B50A79D8">
become natural to them, and &s;o by natural Gene|ration are tran&s;mitted to their Offspring; in&s;o|much that there are now within us Lu&s;ts of every kind, according to the &s;everal Faculties and Affec|tions of the Soul, Sen&s;ations and Appetites of the Body, which are di&s;tingui&s;hed into &s;piritual and fle&s;hly and worldly Lu&s;ts; which &s;everal kinds of Lu&s;ts, are comprized and di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Apo&s;tle, into <HI>the Lu&s;t of the Fle&s;h, the Lu&s;t of the Eye, and the Pride of Life.</HI> 1. <HI>Joh.</HI> 2. 16. Now all the&s;e Lu&s;ts war in our Members: they keep up a perpetual Conte&s;t and Struggle within us.</P>
<P>Here let me &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The&s;e Lu&s;ts are at war one with another.</HI></P>
<P>The Lu&s;ts of Men, altho' they have a likene&s;s in &s;ome re&s;pects, yet are far from having any real Harmony or Agreement among them&s;elves. For as they have all one common Nature, which con&s;i&s;ts in irregular Motions and De&s;ires of the Fle&s;h and Spirit, &s;o the natural Tendency of them mu&s;t needs be to jar and jo&s;tle one with ano|ther. They have all different Views and Inte|re&s;ts, and are pur&s;uing different De&s;igns; and what will be the natural Effect hereof, but the thwart|ing and oppo&s;ing each other continually? The Lu&s;ts of the Fle&s;h interfering with tho&s;e of the Spirit, in &s;eeking after their &s;everal Gratificati|ons, and worldly Lu&s;ts oppo&s;ing them both; Pride, Luxury and Intemperance, being all oppo&s;ed by Covetou&s;ne&s;s or an inordinate De&s;ire after an hoard of earthly Riches. But then,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The&s;e Lu&s;ts do all war in our Members, even again&s;t our Souls and Bodies.</HI></P>
<P>Altho' they are at continual Variance among them&s;elves; yet as the <HI>Jews</HI> of old, in the mid&s;t of their civil Di&s;cords and Divi&s;ions, when <HI>Je|ru&s;alem</HI> was be&s;ieged, would unite their Forces a|gain&s;t
<PB N="10" REF="003623_0008_100201EA95C614D8">
their common Enemy, &s;o the&s;e di&s;agree|ing Lu&s;ts all unite again&s;t <HI>us</HI> as their common E|nemy. The&s;e wicked and unrea&s;onable Lu&s;ts, have entered into a Confederacy, rather a Con&s;piracy again&s;t us, and are offering the utmo&s;t Violence to our Natures. They have u&s;urped the Domini|on, and gotten the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our Souls and Bodies, &s;o as to weaken and deprave the Facul|ties of the one, and to make u&s;e of the Members of the other, as <HI>the In&s;truments of Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s unto Sin.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e rebellious Lu&s;ts have turned Rea&s;on off the Throne, and Con&s;cience from the Judgment-Seat: and as for the Will and Affections, they have &s;o conquered and corrupted them, that they have in a great mea&s;ure, if not entirely, brought them over to their Side. But now, the noble in|tellective Powers of the Soul, are far from being ea&s;y while their Rights are thus invaded, and their Prerogatives thus encroached upon; and by the Means and Helps that God affords them, in his Word and by his Spirit, they are for recover|ing their original Dignity and Authority. And hence ari&s;es a perpetual Struggle in the Man, the Fle&s;h lu&s;ting again&s;t the Spirit, and the Spirit a|gain&s;t the Fle&s;h, as the Apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>Gal.</HI> 5. 17.</P>
<P>Thus every Man becomes the Seat of War and the Field of Battle.</P>
<P>But oh! what Calamities! what De&s;olations! what De&s;truction and Mi&s;ery! has this inte&s;tine War bro't upon us! what Tumult, what Confu|&s;ion does it keep us in perpetually! How do the&s;e violent and impetuous Lu&s;ts, either by &s;etting them&s;elves in Battle-array, bear down all the Dic|tates of Rea&s;on, Revelation and Con&s;cience, and even force us to yield to their &s;inful Demands!
<PB N="11" REF="003623_0009_1002353E055A73F0">
or how by the &s;ecret and &s;udden Sallies of &s;ome particular Lu&s;ts, be&s;t acquainted with our Tempers and Circum&s;tances, take us at unawares, and carry us away <HI>captive at their Will?</HI></P>
<P>And Oh! how ba&s;e and cruel are the&s;e u&s;urp|ing Tyrants, when they have gotten us into their Hands!</P>
<P>How do they profane and pro&s;titute our Bodies (de&s;igned for the Temples of the holy Gho&s;t, and that God has curiou&s;ly wrought in the low|er parts of the Earth, and made in &s;uch a fear|ful and wonderful Manner as we now behold them) to all our ba&s;e and filthy De&s;ires! and in&s;tead of having any regard to our Health, and the pre&s;ervation of our Con&s;titution, every Member is made a Slave to &s;ome ba&s;e Lu&s;t or o|ther, and rather than deny them&s;elves any Grati|fications, they will abu&s;e our Bodies to &s;uch a de|gree, as to bring on Weakne&s;s and Pains, Di&s;ea&s;es and Death it &s;elf.</P>
<P>And then again, the&s;e in&s;ulting Lu&s;ts are no le&s;s abu&s;ive to our Souls. For in&s;tead of paying a proper regard to the dignity of their &s;uperiour Nature, and a due defference to the Dictates of their nobler Powers, which carry a Maje&s;ty with them, they will vent their utmo&s;t Fury at them, as being their mo&s;t potent Adver&s;aries, and that give the greate&s;t di&s;turbance to their &s;inful In|dulgences. The&s;e therefore they bend all their Force again&s;t, that if po&s;&s;ible they might prevail over them, to &s;uch a degree, as to go on in the Plea&s;ures of Sin without any Check or controul from them. And the uncircumci&s;ed Phili&s;tins never dealt more ba&s;ely with <HI>Samp&s;on</HI> their great Enemy, than the&s;e Lu&s;ts do with our Souls. <HI>They put out the Eyes</HI> of our Under&s;tandings, and make us <HI>grind</HI> unto them: improving our Skill and
<PB N="12" REF="003623_0010_1002352766EDE588">
Knowledge in projecting and contriving for their further gratification. And how do they abu&s;e an Under&s;tanding thus blinded as to Spiritual Things, calling for it upon every Occa&s;ion, to find &s;ome way or other to plea&s;e and <HI>make Sport</HI> for them?</P>
<P>In Short, there are no in&s;ults too gro&s;s for the&s;e Lu&s;ts to offer to the Soul. They care not how they wrong and wound it; and rather than deny a Lu&s;t they will degrade and defile the Soul, and make us more vile than the Bea&s;ts that peri&s;h. To plea&s;e a Lu&s;t, they will put the Soul upon the Rack, and by rea&s;on of guilty Fears fill it with the utmo&s;t Horrours and Di&s;tre&s;s; nay they will kill and de&s;troy it forever, if it be not re&s;cued out of their Hands by the Almighty Grace of God.</P>
<P>Thus the&s;e wicked and unrea&s;onable Lu&s;ts war in our Members, even again&s;t all the Members of our Bodies and the Faculties of our Souls.</P>
<P>I proceed now to the Second general Head,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The&s;e Lu&s;ts that thus war in our Members, are the Cau&s;e of all the Wars and Fightings that are among the Children of Men.</HI></P>
<P><HI>From whence come Wars and Fightings among you? come they not hence even of your Lu&s;ts?</HI> The Lu&s;ts of Men don't confine their malign Influence with|in the very Per&s;ons they have gotten the Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of, but being in&s;atiable in their De&s;ires as well as unrea&s;onable in their Demands tho&s;e Men that are under the Government of them, naturally fall into Broils and Conte&s;ts one with another. For as different Lu&s;ts in the &s;ame Subject are conti|nually jarring with each other, &s;o not only dif|ferent Lu&s;ts, but even the &s;ame Lu&s;ts in different Subjects, will naturally &s;et them at Variance, and be a means of their breaking forth into Quarrels, and oftentimes at length into Wars and Blood|&s;heds.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="003623_0011_100201E526E71758">
The&s;e are they that <HI>have turned the World up|&s;ide down</HI> where-ever they have prevailed, and kept it in Wars and Confu&s;ions in &s;ome part or other, from the fir&s;t entrance of Sin and Lu&s;t into the World to this Day. Lu&s;t had no &s;ooner entered our fir&s;t Parents, but <HI>Adam</HI> was for accu&s;ing his Wife<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. 3. 12.</NOTE>, and doubtle&s;s a Quarrel immediately en|&s;ued. And the two fir&s;t Sons that were born to them, were no &s;ooner grown up, but the Spirit that lu&s;teth to Envy, prevailed in one to &s;uch a degree that he &s;lew his Brother<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gen. 4. 8.</NOTE> And oh! what Hatred, Variance, Emulations, Strifes, Wars and Fightings have, there been in the World ever &s;ince!</P>
<P>The Lu&s;ts that are in the World, and that are in a peculiar manner litigious and contentious are &s;uch as the&s;e, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> Pride, Envy, Malice, Di&s;con|tent, Emulation, Wrath, Jealou&s;y, Deceit, Cove|tou&s;ne&s;s, and the like. And now if we trace up the Quarrels that are in Families and among Friends and Neighbours, the civil Di&s;cords. Tu|mults and Animo&s;ities in particular Nations be|tween Princes and their Subjects, and all the Re|ligious Controver&s;ies in the Church, which have been generally carried on with as great Fiercene&s;s and Rage as any; and la&s;tly, if we were able to traver&s;e all the Wars that have been among the Nations and Kingdoms of the Earth, we &s;hall find the Origin of them in &s;ome or other of the fore|mentioned Lu&s;ts. How came it to pa&s;s that Nati|on has been at War again&s;t Nation, and Kingdom again&s;t Kingdom, in the &s;everal Ages and Genera|tions of the World; &s;o that there has &s;carce ever been a univer&s;al Peace, but from Men's Lu&s;ts, at lea&s;t on one &s;ide, and mo&s;t commonly on both?
<PB N="14" REF="003623_0012_1002354DD259B160">
Indeed the Emperor <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> &s;hut the Temple of <HI>Janus</HI> the third time, in Token of a univer&s;al Peace, when Chri&s;t the Prince of Peace made his entrance into the World; but whether it reached any further than the Roman Empire is uncer|tain.</P>
<P>What is it that has brought &s;uch mighty Armies into the Field, that has covered the Face there|of with humaine Blood, that has ravaged &s;o many Countries, and laid &s;o many rich and beautiful Cities wa&s;te, but the un&s;ufferable Pride of Princes, and the in&s;atiable Avarice, Cruelty and Blood-thir&s;|tine&s;s of their Officers and Soldiers? Whence was it that the mighty Monarch of <HI>A&s;&s;yria</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and Emperors of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> &s;ent their vic|torious Armies to all Kingdoms Countries and Pro|vinces within their Knowledge, to &s;ubdue and conquer them, but from their (I had almo&s;t &s;aid) infinite Pride, gra&s;ping at an univer&s;al Monarchy, and from their Cruelty, Tyranny and Covetou&s;|ne&s;s, which have born down all regard to the Laws of Nations, or the natural Rights and Pro|perties of Men? And what are we to think of many of tho&s;e mighty and renowned Heroes, but as &s;o many lawle&s;s Tyrants, who when they led their Captives in Triumph thro' their capital Ci|ties, were them&s;elves in a much more inglorious Manner led in Triumph by their own Lu&s;ts?</P>
<P>And then if we look into the Chri&s;tian World, and among the Nations that profe&s;s Subjection to the <HI>Prince of Peace,</HI> and to be governed by the <HI>Go&s;pel of Peace,</HI> we &s;hall find they have been as often at War as other Nations, and their Wars to have taken their Ri&s;e from as ba&s;e a Cau&s;e. What has been the Cau&s;e of all the dreadful Wars in <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> but the Pride of Princes, aiming at a greater Dominion than was their Right; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">

their Covetou&s;ne&s;s, wickedly de&s;iring to be en|riched by the Spoils of their Nei'bours; or from a jealous and envious Spirit, not bearing to &s;ee others grow greater than them&s;elves; or from an|gry Re&s;entment and cruel Revenge, raging in the brea&s;ts of haughty Princes to &s;uch a degree, that nothing but the Blood and De&s;truction of tho&s;e again&s;t whom they are incen&s;ed can &s;atisfy? And how often have the mo&s;t publick Treaties of Peace, Leagues and Alliances that have been entered in|to, and in the mo&s;t &s;olemn Manner ratified and confirmed, been violated and broken in upon by the&s;e deceitful Lu&s;ts?

I don't &s;ay it is always &s;o; for altho' it is hard to con|ceive how a War &s;hould begin but from &s;ome Lu&s;t or other; yet we can &s;ee how it may be pro&s;ecuted on the other &s;ide without. For there is no doubt, but when the ju&s;t Rights of a Nati|on or People are invaded and incroached upon by a Foreign Power, they may oppo&s;e and re&s;i&s;t e|ven unto Blood; yea, and may pro&s;ecute the War &s;o far again&s;t them as to recover their Rights, and take Satisfaction for the Damages &s;u&s;tained by the Inva&s;ions of their Enemies; provided that Sati&s;|faction be not offered, and cannot be obtained in a more gentle Way. Yea, and I &s;ee not why they may not proceed to weaken the Power of the Aggre&s;&s;or, that has often proved fal&s;e and treache|rous, &s;o far as &s;hall di&s;courage from making any further A&s;&s;aults upon them.

How would Nations and Countries and Kingdoms be &s;acrificed to the Revenge of each other, and how would the le&s;&s;er and weaker Kingdoms be &s;wallowed up and devoured by tho&s;e of &s;uperiour Strength and Numbers, if it was not for the Lord to whom the Kingdoms of the World belong, and <HI>who is the Governour among the Nations,</HI> who <HI>cau|&s;es the Wrath of Man to prai&s;e him,</HI> by accom|pli&s;hing his Purpo&s;es and De&s;igns upon a Per&s;on or People, and then <HI>re&s;trains the remainder of it,</HI> &s;ay|ing to the in&s;ulting and invading Powers of the Earth, as in <HI>Job.</HI> 38. 11. <HI>Hitherto &s;halt thou come, but no further, and here &s;hall thy proud Waves be &s;tayed.</HI></P>

<P>For as the Lu&s;ts which entered into their Hearts took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the human Nature, and have been propogated to all the natural De&s;cendants of <HI>Adam,</HI> &s;o they have been the unhappy Parents of all the Mi&s;eries and Calamities that are or have been in the World. Lu&s;t had no &s;ooner entered the Heart of Man, but it conceived and bro't forth Sin, and a Train of innumerable Evils with it. It bro'c Cur&s;e on the Earth, and in a great mea&s;ure, put the whole Frame of Nature here be|low

out of Cour&s;e: But in a more e&s;pecial man|ner has it di&s;ordered the human Nature, and put tho&s;e Faculties among which there was a perfect Harmony, at the utmo&s;t Variance, and &s;et every Man at war with him&s;elf. But the&s;e are not all the unhappy Effects of Men's Lu&s;ts; for they are al|&s;o the Seeds of Di&s;cord that are &s;own among Brethren, and the Cau&s;e of all the Wars and the Calamities which the World, by rea&s;on hereof, have laboured under from the beginning to this Day. Little did our fir&s;t Parents think of the Di&s;order Confu&s;ion and Mi&s;ery, which they entailed upon their Po&s;terity, when they hearkened to the &s;ug|ge&s;tions of Satan, and gave way to an irregular De&s;ire.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>We learn what may be expected and look'd for in a World that is full of Sin and Lu&s;t, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Wars and Rumours of Wars continually.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are but the natural Effects of Pride, En|vy, Jealou&s;y, Malice, Covetou&s;ne&s;s, and the like; And when we &s;ee the&s;e Lu&s;ts continuing and pre|vailing in our &s;elves and among Mankind in gene|ral, what can we expect but Tumults in our own Brea&s;ts, Jars in Families, Di&s;cords among Bre|thren, Quarrels among Nei'bours, Divi&s;ions in the Church, Contentions in the State, and Wars and Fightings among the Nations? The&s;e things na|turally follow upon Men's Lu&s;ts; and we may as well expect that Cau&s;es will cea&s;e to produce their Effects, as that the&s;e things &s;hould di&s;continue, while Men are in&s;laved to their Lu&s;ts.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The only way to &s;olid and la&s;ting Peace, is to curb and conquer Men's Lu&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>There can be no way &s;o effectual to procure and &s;ettle Peace upon a &s;ure Foundation, as to &s;trike at the Root of all Contentions; and what is that but the Lu&s;ts of Men? Let them be but once de&s;troy|ed,
<PB N="18" REF="003623_0016_100201E842A575B0">
and there is nothing remains to di&s;turb within, or to &s;tir up Wars without. Take away the Cau&s;e and the Effect cea&s;eth. Take away the Lu&s;ts that are in the World, and Wars would come to a per|petual End, and our Peace will be as a River, con|&s;tant and never failing. Then a People would be at Peace among them&s;elves, and their Ways being &s;uch as plea&s;e the Lord, their Enemies would al&s;o be at Peace with them.</P>
<P>And this leads me to infer,</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The Excellency of the Go&s;pel, and the happy Ten|dency of its Doctrines and Precepts, to procure and e&s;tabli&s;h Peace among Men.</HI></P>
<P>For the De&s;ign of the Go&s;pel is to &s;ubdue Men's Lu&s;ts, to clean&s;e us from all Filthine&s;s of Fle&s;h and Spirit: <HI>The Grace of God,</HI> the Go&s;pel, <HI>that bringeth Salvation, and that hath appeared unto us, teacheth us to deny Ungodline&s;s and worldly Lu&s;ts;</HI> yea, and all &s;piritual and fle&s;hly Lu&s;ts. And if once the Go&s;pel had taken &s;uch powerful and univer&s;al Ef|fect, as to root out the&s;e Lu&s;ts, then would there be, as was &s;ung by the heavenly Ho&s;t, at the coming of the <HI>Me&s;&s;ias,</HI> and fir&s;t &s;etting up the Go&s;pel Kingdom, <HI>Peace on Earth, and good will a|mong Men,</HI> as well as <HI>Glory to God in the high|e&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>And it is only becau&s;e the Go&s;pel does not reign &s;o powerfully and univer&s;ally in the Hearts of Men, as it ought, that tho&s;e Prophecies of uni|ver&s;al Peace and Tranquility to be in Go&s;pel-Times, are not as yet accompli&s;hed. Let Men but live up to the Principles and Precepts of the Chri&s;|tian Di&s;pen&s;ation, and &s;ee if it would not then be as the Prophet foretold, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 2. 4. <HI>They &s;hall beat their Swords into Plow &s;hares, and their Spears into Pruning-Hooks, Nation &s;hall not lift up Sword again&s;t Nation, neither &s;hall they learn War any more.</HI></P>

5. <HI>We learn, that Heaven mu&s;t needs be a Place of perfect Peace and Quietne&s;s forever, becau&s;e entirely freed from Sin and Lu&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Heaven is a high and holy Place, into which nothing enters that defiles; and every Inhabitant being made perfect in Holine&s;s, there can't be the lea&s;t Di&s;cord or Difference among them. In|deed tho&s;e litigious Lu&s;ts of Pride and Envy did once invade tho&s;e pure and peaceful Regions, when a number of Angels revolted, and a dreadful War commenced upon it; but tho&s;e apo&s;tate Spirits being over-born by a &s;uperiour Power, were immediately bani&s;hed tho&s;e blisful Abodes, as Di&s;turbers of their Peace, and Interrupters of their Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>And now none can enter there, but &s;uch as are intirely clean&s;ed from all their Lu&s;ts, and made perfect in Holine&s;s. No Pride, no Envy, no Di&s;content can come within the Gates of this coele&s;tial City, but every one that has an entrance mini&s;tred to him into this everla&s;ting Kingdom, being thus perfectly freed from the&s;e di&s;turbing Lu&s;ts, there mu&s;t needs be an inviolable Peace and perpetual Harmony among them. <Q>In&s;tead of looking with a contemptuous or envious Eye upon one another, they will by a &s;ublimated Charity, delight in each others Happine&s;s, and all rejoice in God, the Centre of their Bli&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>But to come to &s;ome Inferrences that are more immediately to the Purpo&s;es and De&s;igns of the pre&s;ent Day.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>What we have heard, may help us to judge, in a good mea&s;ure, as to the Lawfulne&s;s or Unlawfulne&s;s of a War.</HI></P>
<P>For this we may lay down as a general Rule, That a War rai&s;ed and pro&s;ecuted meerly by Men's Lu&s;ts, mu&s;t needs be unlawful on the &s;ide of the
<PB N="20" REF="003623_0018_1002352162DE1A08">
Aggre&s;&s;or: But then the &s;ame War becomes law|ful, and very nece&s;&s;ary on the &s;ide of the Oppo|&s;er</P>
<P>When a Prince thro' Pride, Envy or Avarice, makes unrea&s;onable Demands upon his Nei'bour Princes, and upon their refu&s;ing to comply, pro|ceeds in a ho&s;tile Manner to force them to it, it mu&s;t needs be unlawful, contrary to the Law of God, of Nature, and the profe&s;&s;ed Rules of all civilized Nations. For the &s;uperiour Strength of one Nation gives them no more Right to invade the Properties and Priviledges of another, than one Man's being &s;tronger than another, gives him a right to injure and abu&s;e him. And for one Nation to encroach upon the Rights and Proper|ties of a Nei'bour Nation, by Force and Arms, is only a more open Violence, Robbery and Mur|ther. But then as there is no way for &s;uch a People to &s;uppre&s;s, re&s;i&s;t, or get Satisfaction for the Violence and Injuries offered them, but by the like Force and warlike Proceedings; &s;o this mu&s;t needs be very ju&s;t and lawful, yea, and the Duty of &s;uch an injured People, provided that rea&s;onable Terms of Peace and Satisfaction have been propo&s;ed, and a Compliance therewith re|fu&s;ed by their Adver&s;aries. For, for one Nation to &s;ubmit to be injured, invaded and run upon by another, without re&s;i&s;ting and oppo&s;ing them with their utmo&s;t Power, (when Terms of Peace have been unrea&s;onably rejected) would argue &s;uch a Cowardice and Meane&s;s of Spirit, that the Go&s;pel, as much as it preaches up Peace, would reprove &s;uch a people for. For however it may direct private Chri&s;tians to &s;uffer injuries rather than revenge them&s;elves, yet it does not for|bid them from bringing &s;uch Offenders before the civil Magi&s;trate to be corrected for their Wick|edne&s;s,
<PB N="21" REF="003623_0019_100235534BFE5FA0">
who is declared to be the Mini&s;ter of God, a Revenger to execute Wrath upon him that doth evil, <HI>Rom.</HI> 13. 4. And much more nece&s;&s;a|ry is it to &s;top the Violence, and take Satisfacti|on for Injuries offered to a whole Nation. But as this can't be done by the civil Magi&s;trate, becau&s;e their Power is confined within their own Government, therefore there is no other Way for a Nation, as &s;uch, to defend or recover their ju&s;t Rights, but by entering into a War again&s;t their Enemies, which mu&s;t needs be lawful, and the Duty of an injured People, when all Capitulati|ons prove in vain.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, a War is lawful, when it is entered into, not for the gratifying our own Lu&s;ts, but for the oppo&s;ing the Lu&s;ts of others that are in|jurious to us. A War is lawful, when it is for the nece&s;&s;ary Defence or recovering of our ju&s;t Rights. It is lawful al&s;o to enter into a War, when our Help is de&s;ired, for the nece&s;&s;ary Pro|tection and Relief of a People whom we &s;ee op|pre&s;&s;ed, and in Danger of being &s;wallowed up by their Enemies, who have without Cau&s;e ri&s;en up again&s;t them. And I don't &s;ee why a War may not be lawful, for the oppo&s;ing and &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the growing Power and Tyranny of any Nation, whom we behold advancing them&s;elves, by vio|lent and unju&s;t Encroachments upon their Neigh|bours, to &s;uch a degree of Power, as would over|ballance all the Force that we could make again&s;t them. Now in the&s;e and &s;uch like Ca&s;es, (for I don't pretend to have mentioned every thing that will ju&s;tify a warlike Proceeding) a People may make War, and go forth in a humble Dependance upon Almighty God to protect them, and pro&s;|per their ju&s;t Arms again&s;t their Enemies. For a War entered into upon &s;uch Accounts as the&s;e,
<PB N="22" REF="003623_0020_100235568EEA9A80">
is the Cau&s;e of Ju&s;tice and Mercy, and that is the Cau&s;e of God, and He will be on our Side, and if He be for us, we need not fear who is a|gain&s;t us.</P>
<P>But here I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, That it is not &s;o much the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Soldier to enquire into the Merits of the Cau&s;e, and judge whether the War be lawful or unlawful, for that is an Affair in|tru&s;ted with the Prince and Councils of a Nati|on; and the Soldier is to pre&s;ume that the Go|vernment have good Rea&s;ons to ju&s;tify their pro|claiming and engaging in a War: And his Bu&s;i|ne&s;s is to be &s;trong and couragious, and to fight manfully under his Commander, in the &s;everal Po&s;ts of Difficulty and Danger that may be a&s;&s;ign|ed him, without puzling his Mind with &s;crupe|lous Enquiries, whether the War be lawfully enter|ed into or not.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>What we have heard, teaches us after what Manner, and with what Views and Temper of Mind, Men &s;hould go forth to War.</HI></P>
<P>It mu&s;t not be to gratify any Lu&s;t of our own, but for the re&s;i&s;ting and oppo&s;ing the un|rea&s;onable Lu&s;ts of others. It mu&s;t not be to injure and oppre&s;s others, or to invade any of their ju&s;t Rights, but from a generous Concern for the Defence and Safety of our own: Not meerly to hurt and de&s;troy them, from any cruel and &s;avage Di&s;po&s;ition whithin us, but for own Secu|rity.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the Glory of God, the Intere&s;t of Re|ligion, and the Safety of his People, mu&s;t lie neare&s;t the Soldier's Heart; and a Zeal for the&s;e Things mu&s;t fill the Chri&s;tian Soldier with hero|ick Courage and Fortitude of Mind, ready to &s;acrifice his Life and Fortunes for the publick Safety, if called to it. Then, and only then, can
<PB N="23" REF="003623_0021_1002353C74A3C0F8">
he on good Ground expect that God will be a Shield and Buckler to him. &amp;c.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>What we have heard, highly recommends Mi|litary Skill and Courage as ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, under God, for the Defence and Safety of a People.</HI></P>
<P>For con&s;idering our own Lu&s;ts, and the Lu&s;ts of others, we mu&s;t look for Wars and Fightings. Our own Lu&s;ts are &s;uch as may provoke God to &s;tir up our Enemies again&s;t us. We are al&s;o in danger by our Lu&s;ts of abu&s;ing and injuring our Nei'bouring Tribes and Nations, and thereby of &s;tirring up their Corruptions to come in a way of Revenge upon us: Or if we &s;hould by our ju&s;t and hone&s;t Dealings with them, e&s;cape the Guilt of bringing a War upon our &s;elves; yet their Lu&s;ts without any Provocation of ours, may break out again&s;t us. So that con&s;idering the Lu&s;ts of Men, it is impo&s;&s;ible for us to be a&s;&s;ured of the Con|tinuance of Peace.</P>
<P>And therefore it mu&s;t needs be the Wi&s;dom of every People to be &s;o aware of the various Lu&s;ts of Men, and the Manner of their Oppera|tions, as to put and always keep them&s;elves in proper Po&s;tures of Defence; not only by keep|ing up Forts and Ca&s;tles, and &s;uch like Strong Holds in good Repair, but by having a &s;uitable Number of &s;kilful and valiant Soldiers, Men that under&s;tand the Art of War, and have Courage to appear in the Field of Battle.</P>
<P>Altho' Men's Lu&s;ts are the Cau&s;e of War, yet military Skill and Courage are from a nobler Prin|ciple, and are not only con&s;i&s;tent with, but are very much improved and heightened by true Grace. And my Text, altho' it di&s;parages War in general, con&s;idering its Original, yet by Con&s;equence it countenances a warlike Genius: For con&s;idering the Tendency of Men's Lu&s;ts, there mu&s;t needs
<PB N="24" REF="003623_0022_10023540596CD9A0">
be Wars and Fightings; and what is the natural Con&s;equence of this, but that the Art of War is highly u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary, to defend us again&s;t the Violence of Men's Lu&s;ts?</P>
<P>Here therefore let me addre&s;s my &s;elf to the <HI>Honourable Company of the ARTILLERT,</HI> and &s;ay, That your De&s;igns and Endeavours to be thorough|ly skill'd in the Art of War, is very Laudable and Prai&s;e worthy. For con&s;idering the Lu&s;ts and Corruptions of Men prevail after &s;uch a manner, it is become as nece&s;&s;ary an Art as any: And it is the Wi&s;dom and Duty of a People to cultivate and improve it.</P>
<P>It &s;hows what a proper Tho't and Apprehen&s;ion of the&s;e Things our Fore Fathers had, when they e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;uch a Company as this, and encouraged it with certain Privileges and Immunities. It &s;how'd that they were well aware of the Lu&s;ts of Men, and apprehen&s;ive in Con&s;equence hereof, what frequent Occa&s;ions there would be for Men expert in War.</P>
<P>And it is with Plea&s;ure that we now behold this Company increa&s;ing, and more of a military Spirit di&s;covering it &s;elf, by the very con&s;iderable Additions which have been made of late to this Seminary or School for the martial Art. And what is further to be de&s;ired is, that this honou|rable Company might &s;till advance in Reputation, and be of more exten&s;ive Benefit, by the coming in of tho&s;e that &s;u&s;tain the higher Commi&s;&s;ions in the military Order, &s;uch as the Field-Officers in the &s;everal Regiments, who by attending the&s;e &s;tated Exerci&s;es a few Times in a Year, would be able to propagate this u&s;eful Art to their Subal|terns, and they to their &s;everal Companies; and &s;o the whole Militia of the Land might be gloried of,
<PB N="25" REF="003623_0023_1002352C944FA178">
as tho&s;e of the Tribes of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> in I <HI>Chron.</HI> 12. 30, 33. That <HI>were Men of Valour, expert in War, that could keep Rank, and were not of a double Heart.</HI></P>
<P>Ble&s;&s;ed be God! We have not had Occa&s;ion for &s;uch di&s;ciplined Soldiers as the&s;e of late, by rea&s;on of the happy Peace we have had for &s;everal Years, and do &s;till enjoy. But we may not expect a long and uninterrupted Series of it; for we may ju&s;t|ly fear that either our own Lu&s;ts, or the Lu&s;ts of others, will break forth and di&s;turb our pre|&s;ent Tranquility. It is nece&s;&s;ary therefore that we &s;hould be always ready, even for a &s;udden Attack: Improve your opportunities therefore in gaining all the Skill, Courage and Conduct that is needfull; for you know not how &s;oon there may be Occa&s;ion for you to go forth and employ the &s;ame, in the Service of God and your Coun|try.</P>
<P>We know not what De&s;igns are forming again&s;t us. That we are hated by &s;ome, and envied by others for our growing greatne&s;s, is not to be doubted. And how &s;oon their Lu&s;ts may ri&s;e to &s;uch a Head, as to break out again&s;t us in an o|pen War, and how &s;oon God &s;hall &s;ee cau&s;e to correct us with &s;uch a Judgment, is known only to Him. And as for the reviving military Skill, if it &s;hould forebode the Approach of War; yet it affords a happy Omen that we &s;hall not be giv|en as a prey to our Enemies: but rather by the&s;e Means God will defend us from our Enemies, and make u&s;e of our Skill to defeat their De&s;igns, and cau&s;e them to turn back a&s;hamed.</P>
<P>But ala&s;s! to what Purpo&s;e is it to have Offi|cers and Soldiers expert it War, and valiant in Battle, and at the &s;ame Time to have our Ca&s;|tles and Batteries, our Forts and Garri&s;ons, neg|lected and &s;uffered to fall to the Ground? Sure|ly

upon the&s;e Accounts we are in a very defence|le&s;s Po&s;ture, and too much re&s;emble <HI>a City with|out Gates and Bars,</HI> yea, a <HI>City broken down, and without Walls.</HI> The decaying State of our For|tifications, looks as if we were not aware of the Lu&s;ts of Men, and thought all Danger of their breaking out again&s;t us was over, and as if the glorious Times were come, when the Nations would learn War no more. But how groundle&s;s are &s;uch Expectations? The Lu&s;ts of Men pre|vail as much as ever, and our growing greatne&s;s naturally excites their Jealou&s;ies and their Envy, and our growing wickedne&s;s as certainly &s;tirs up the fierce Wrath of the Almighty, that gives us rea&s;on to fear He will withdraw His Re&s;traints from them. And what a mi&s;erable Defence &s;hould we be able to make again&s;t a Foreign Inva&s;ion, under our pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances! I don't pre|&s;ume to tax the Government in any Branch of it; but would only ob&s;erve how unhappy it is, that they can't unite in Mea&s;ures for their ne|ce&s;&s;ary Defence. For how can we expect the di|vine Protection, when we can't agree upon Me|thods proper for our own Safety?

<P>There can be no Di&s;pute about the Lawfulne&s;s of carry|ing on this War: For it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and our in|di&s;pen&s;able Duty.
