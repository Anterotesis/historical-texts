<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_WRITING is a Talent which, of all Things, I never made any Preten&s;ions to, and little thought of giving at this Time the Publick an Account of my Practice; but being again importuned thereto, by a great and worthy Phy&s;ician, and having al&s;o received a Me&s;&s;age from a &s;uperior Per&s;on, that an Account of my Succe&s;s of inoculating the Small-Pox in <HI>New-England</HI> might be grateful, as being of great u&s;e, and beneficial to the Publick, I e&s;teem'd it as the &s;trong|e&s;t Obligation upon me &s;o to do, and in Compliance to that Command I have done it faithfully. If I had propo&s;ed any Advantage to my &s;elf, in the Practice here, I &s;hould have done it above a Year pa&s;t, at my Arrival in <HI>London,</HI> and not now at my returning home. And I have given this Account with the greater Chearfulne&s;s, in hope, that my Mite may influence &s;ome few at lea&s;t to &s;ave their Lives this Way, &s;eeing, from Time to Time, in the Weekly Bills, Numbers who died of the Small-Pox, and hearing of but few who have had the Benefit of Inoculation, compar'd with the others in the natural Way, notwith&s;tanding the many and hand&s;ome Accounts which have been given the Publick, greatly in Favour of this Practice.</P>
<P>And it may be of &s;ome Service, was it only on Account of the great Proportion of Adult Per&s;ons, and others advanced in Years, to whom the Small-Pox, in the natural Way,
<PB N="ii" REF="003259_0009_0FF02D342EBA8640">has been mo&s;t fatal: And yet from my Experience, I may be allow'd to &s;ay, that even &s;uch have a very fair Pro|&s;pect of pa&s;&s;ing well thro' that Di&s;temper by Inoculation.</P>
<P>I began the Practice indeed from a &s;hort Con&s;ideration thereof; for my Children, who&s;e Lives were very dear to me, were daily in danger of taking the Infection, by my vi&s;iting the Sick in the natural Way; and although there aro&s;e &s;uch a Cloud of Oppo&s;ers at the Beginning, yet finding my Account in the Succe&s;s, and ea&s;y Circum|&s;tances of my Patients, (with the Encouragement of the good Mini&s;ters) I re&s;olv'd to carry it on for the &s;aving of Lives, not regarding any, or all the Menaces, and Oppo|&s;ition that were made again&s;t it.</P>
<P>I have not, in this Practice, left room for any one to cavil, and &s;ay, that my Experiments have not been fair, and full Proofs, that inoculating the Small-Pox is a cer|tain Means of moderating that Di&s;temper, to the greate&s;t Demon&s;tration. This, the warme&s;t Oppo&s;ers of that Practice, who have &s;een my fair Trials made, are con|vinc'd of; and the only Difficulty of convincing all Man|kind, is how to make them Eye-witne&s;&s;es to a Number &s;ick of the Small-Pox in both ways of Infection; and this would do it at once, and very much to their Satisfaction in, and Approbation of this Method. And here it &s;hould be con&s;idered how ra&s;hly our Patients, even whole Families together, ru&s;hed into this Practice, without any Phy&s;ical Preparation, or other needful Provi&s;ion, e&s;pecially in &s;uch a cold Sea&s;on as <HI>November</HI> and <HI>December,</HI> being convinced of the Succe&s;s of this Method: There was no with&s;tanding them: I mu&s;t inoculate all, without Ex|ception, they being in danger of having the Di&s;temper in the natural way. In <HI>March</HI> and <HI>April,</HI> indeed, we inocu|lated none, and but few in the Summer Sea&s;on. But al|though this Practice from the <HI>Levant</HI> comes recommended to be made u&s;e of in the Winter as the mo&s;t proper Sea|&s;on; yet I did not find it to &s;ucceed &s;o well, and prove &s;o gentle with us in the pinching cold, as in the temperate and hotter Sea&s;ons of the Year.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="003259_0010_0FF02D7C5B4F8FD8">I have not u&s;ed this Practice only to the healthful and &s;trong, but to the weak and di&s;ea&s;ed, the aged and the young: Not only to the rich, but have carried it into the hou&s;es of the poor, and laid down whole Families; and tho' thro' my own Hurry in Bu&s;ine&s;s, and their living out of Town, I have been forced to leave them to the Manage|ment of unexperienced Nur&s;es, yet they all did well.</P>
<P>And as to tho&s;e &s;ix who died under Inoculation, I would ob&s;erve that Mrs. <HI>Dixwell,</HI> we have great Rea&s;on to be|lieve, was infected before. Mr. <HI>White,</HI> thro' &s;plenetic Delu&s;ions, died rather from Ab&s;tinence than the Small-Pox. Mrs. <HI>Scarbrough</HI> and the <HI>Indian</HI> Girl died of Accidents, by taking cold. Mrs. <HI>Wells</HI> and <HI>Searle</HI> were Per&s;ons worn out with Age and Di&s;ea&s;es, and very like|ly the&s;e two were infected before. Neither can it be &s;aid, that there was one &s;ound and healthful Per&s;on among&s;t them.</P>
<P>We met with no &s;uch terrible Effects (&s;ave that Death is terrible in all its Shapes) from the Small-Pox inocu|lated, as was common among&s;t us in the natural way, <HI>viz.</HI> Purple Spots, Convul&s;ion Fits, bloody Urine, violent Inflammations in the Eyes, Throat, and other Parts, &s;carr'd Faces, &s;ome who had lo&s;t both Eyes, and, as it has been thought, near an hundred one Eye, with many more melancholy Symptoms too tedious here to enumerate; not to mention Parents being left Childle&s;s, Children without Parents, and &s;ometimes Parents and Children's being both carried off, and many Families broken up by the De|&s;truction the Small-Pox made in the natural way. In|deed, we had &s;ome Re&s;emblance of tho&s;e Effects; but in none where it was not evident, that they were infected in the natural way before; and tho' we met with but five or &s;ix ca&s;es that bordered on, or re&s;embled more or le&s;s tho&s;e Symptoms, yet it would not have been &s;trange had there been &s;ix times that Number; for in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and in the middle of <HI>Roxbury,</HI> no one knew who were, or who were not infected, before inoculated; and I verily believe that twenty five, if not thirty of my Patients were infected before inoculated: And this Rea&s;on I can give for every
<PB N="iv" REF="003259_0011_0FF02D38D778C230">one's believing &s;o, that in all and every one whom I Inocu|lated, and that had not been expos'd to an infected Air, and which were above one hundred, not any of them had the lea&s;t Shadow of &s;uch Symptoms upon them, thro' the whole Cour&s;e of their Di&s;temper. However, I do not re|commend this Practice to be carry'd on and manag'd by old Women and Nur&s;es; no, I would have it carry'd on and manag'd by good Phy&s;icians and Surgeons, where they are to be had; but rather than the People &s;hould be left a Prey to the Small-Pox in the natural Way, let it be manag'd by Nur&s;es, for I cannot help thinking that even in their Hands, many le&s;s would die of the Small-Pox by Inoculation, than there does in the natural Way, tho' in the be&s;t of Hands, and under the be&s;t of Care.</P>
<P>And for tho&s;e that have not yet come into this Practice, for their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, until they have gain'd better Know|ledge, I have given &s;ome &s;hort Directions how they may proceed with their Patients, when they begin this Pra|ctice of inoculating the Small-Pox. And if what I have done, in giving this Account, may (with the Labour and Pains which has been taken by many worthy Gentlemen on this Head) contribute to the leading People into a Method for &s;aving their Lives, and their Bodies from many other Mi&s;eries that do frequently attend tho&s;e that have the natural Small-Pox; I &s;hall obtain my End, and the World will have the Benefit.</P>
<P>I ought to apologize, and ask Pardon of my good Friends in <HI>New England,</HI> for this Liberty I have taken, of pub|li&s;hing their Names, Ages, and Ca&s;es, without their leave, more e&s;pecially the young Ladies. And when they con|&s;ider how difficult a thing it is, to &s;et Truth in a clear Light in this Ca&s;e to the Satisfaction of an unbelieving World; and how much room there wou'd have been left to tho&s;e who are not willing to believe, and that are Wranglers again&s;t this Practice, to have &s;lighted, and argued again&s;t the Truth and Validity of the&s;e Accounts, were it not for tho&s;e Particulars; for I mu&s;t &s;tand or fall by the&s;e Accounts,: I &s;ay, when they con&s;ider that it was done for the good of Mankind, they will forgive
<PB N="v" REF="003259_0012_0FF02D7E160BA188">me, and upon that Account only I hope and de&s;ire to be forgiven.</P>
<P>I do not call upon or exhort the Phy&s;icians and Sur|geons who are already in the Practice, and have u&s;ed their Endeavours to promote it, nor do I pretend to inform or in&s;truct them. My De&s;ign is only to &s;tir up tho&s;e who have not yet come into and u&s;ed this Method, and to lay before the People a fair &s;tate of the Di&s;temper in both ways of Infection, that they may be appriz'd of the danger in the one, and the rea&s;onable Expectation they have of doing well in the other. My Rea&s;onings and O|pinions I &s;ubmit to tho&s;e of better Judgment, but as we are rational Creatures, we do, or &s;hould delight in acting upon Principles of Rea&s;on; and tho&s;e who con&s;ider this Method, and make u&s;e of it, I think may be &s;aid &s;o to act.</P>
<P>I hope the Reader will excu&s;e me for troubling him with &s;ome of the Difficulties that I met with. I have been ba&s;ely us'd and treated by &s;ome who were Enemies to this Method, and have &s;uffered much in my Reputation and in my Bu&s;ine&s;s too, from the Odiums and Reflections ca&s;t upon me for beginning and carrying on this Practice in <HI>New England</HI>; which ill U&s;age I think ju&s;tly intitles me to make the nece&s;&s;ary Reflections, and relate Matters of Fact in my own Ju&s;tification, and to recommend and do Ju&s;tice to the Method, which was &s;o expos'd and con|demn'd by their Mi&s;repre&s;entations, which have been &s;pread abroad in the World; and to &s;et things in a good Light, that the World may impartially judge between the Parties (if I may be allow'd the Term) which of the two have acted mo&s;t like Men and Chri&s;tians, <HI>viz.</HI> Whe|ther tho&s;e who have oppos'd and exclaim'd again&s;t this Method without due Con&s;ideration of, or knowing &s;carce any thing about it; or tho&s;e who have con&s;ider'd well, been in the Practice of, and have prov'd by their own Experience, or that have &s;een the good Effects and Be|nefit of it, and from &s;uch Rea&s;ons have recommended it to others?</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="003259_0013_0FF02D3BC6CD8808">Indeed I can ea&s;ily forgive and pity tho&s;e who thro' Tenderne&s;s, or in Point of Con&s;cience, have refu&s;ed the offer'd Mercy, and that have gently appear'd again&s;t it: Such, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Divine, together with the Exerci&s;e of their own Rea&s;on upon it, may ea&s;ily get thro' their Difficulties. But for tho&s;e who out of private Piques, or Views, have exclaim'd and railed again&s;t it, and who have trumpt up the groundle&s;s ill Con&s;equences that would attend or follow it: Such I leave to &s;weat it out with ju&s;t Reflection and due Repentance. As for my own Part, I know of no better Way of judging between moral and im|moral Methods of Medical Practice, than from the good or ill Succe&s;s that does, or may attend them.</P>
<P>I have, for Di&s;tinction &s;ake, call'd the Small-Pox taken in the Air (only) natural; tho' I know not any Rea&s;on why that by Inoculation may not be call'd &s;o too, for I think the di&s;tinct, in either Way, to be the mo&s;t genuine Effect of Nature; and the Difference between them &s;eems only to be, as in that of improving Plants, the one is propagated by Nature accidentally, and the other by Nature with Indu&s;try, with Intent to make them better. The one is called wild, the other tame, or improv'd; and as the Ground is good or bad, &s;o will the Plant or Fruit be dif|fering, more or le&s;s: So it will be in the Small-Pox tran&s;planted. Forgive me this Compari&s;on, it may not hold good in &s;trict Philo&s;ophy. None of our inoculated Patients afterward took the Small-Pox, tho' they were continually expos'd. I make this Ob&s;ervation le&s;t the Que&s;tion &s;hould be asked, tho' I think it high Time that groundle&s;s Scruples &s;hould be laid a&s;ide.</P>
<P>There is a large Field open for much to be &s;aid by the Ingenious and Learned in Prai&s;e of this Method, and I hope, good Improvement will be made in, and by it.</P>

<HEAD>THE INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>_THE <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> which had been a Terror to <HI>New-England</HI> &s;ince fir&s;t it paid a Vi&s;it there, coming into <HI>Bo&s;|ton,</HI> and &s;preading there in <HI>April,</HI> 1721, put the Inhabitants into great Con&s;ternation and Di&s;order. Dr. <HI>Mather,</HI> in Compa&s;&s;ion to the Lives of the People, tran&s;|crib'd from the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions of the Royal Society, the Accounts &s;ent them by Dr. <HI>Timonius</HI> and <HI>Pyllarinus</HI> of inoculating the Small-Pox in the <HI>Levant,</HI> and &s;ent them to the Practitioners of the Town, for their Con&s;idera|tion thereon. Upon reading of which I was very well pleas'd, and re&s;olv'd in my Mind to try the Experiment; well remembring the De&s;truc|tion the Small-Pox made 19 Years before, when la&s;t in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI>; and how narrowly I then e&s;cap'd with my Life. Now, when my Wife and many others were gone out of Town' to avoid the Di&s;|temper, and all Hope given up of preventing the further &s;preading of it, and the Guards were
<PB N="2" REF="003259_0015_0FF02D3EA1D8BBE0">fir&s;t removed from the Doors of infected Hou|&s;es, I began the Experiment; and not being a|ble to make it upon my &s;elf, (&s;uch was my Faith in the Safety and Succe&s;s of this Method) I cho&s;e to make it (for Example &s;ake) upon my own dear Child, and two of my Servants.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="text">
<P><HI>_JUNE</HI> the 26th, 1721. I inoculated my Son <HI>Thomas,</HI> of about &s;ix, my Negro Man, <HI>Jack,</HI> thirty &s;ix, and <HI>Jackey,</HI> two and an half Years old. They all complain'd on the 6th Day; upon the 7th, the two Children were a little hot, dull and &s;leepy, <HI>Thomas</HI> (only) had twitchings and &s;tarted in his &s;leep. The 8th, the Childrens Fevers continued, <HI>Tommy</HI>'s twitch|ings and &s;tartings in &s;leep increa&s;ed; and tho' the Fever was gentle and his Sen&s;es bright, yet as the Practice was new, and the Clamour, or rather Rage of the People again&s;t it &s;o violent, that I was put into a very great Fright; and not having any Directions from Dr. <HI>Timonius</HI> and <HI>Pyllarinus</HI> concerning this Practice, I had no|thing to have Recour&s;e to but Patience, and therefore waited upon Nature for a Cri&s;is (nei|ther my Fears nor the Symptoms abating) un|til the 9th; when early in the Morning I gave him a Vomit, upon which the Symptoms went off, and the &s;ame Day, upon him and the black Child, a kind and favourable Small-Pox came out, of about an hundred a piece; after which their Circum&s;tances became ea&s;y, our Trouble was over, and they &s;oon were well.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="003259_0016_0FF02D81F6168AD8"><HI>Jack's</HI> Complaints, in two or three Days were over, and tho' he had but a few Pu&s;tles about one of his Inoculations, I am inclin'd to think he had had the Small-Pox before.</P>
<P>It was plain and ea&s;y to &s;ee, (even in the&s;e two) with Plea&s;ure, the difference between ha|ving the Small-Pox this way, and that of ha|ving it in the natural way.</P>
<P>And as this Practice was new in <HI>Europe,</HI> &s;o it mu&s;t needs make a &s;trange Figure in <HI>New-Eng|land,</HI> and more e&s;pecially &s;o when one or two of our learned <HI>E&s;culapian</HI> Tribe had made the Di&s;|covery how this Practice wou'd produce the Plague <HI>viz.</HI> becau&s;e <HI>Timonius</HI> told them that it &s;ome|times happen'd that Swellings were produc'd by it in &s;ome Emunctory of the Body; and like|wi&s;e they cavilled and &s;aid, that Dr. <HI>Mather</HI> had not given a fair Repre&s;entation from <HI>Timo|nius</HI> and <HI>Pyllarinus</HI>'s Accounts. I pray'd that they might be read; but Dr. <HI>Douglas,</HI> who own'd them, and had taken them from Dr. <HI>Mather,</HI> re|fu&s;ed to have them read, or even afterwards to lend them to the Governor to read; &s;uch was his extraordinary Care, le&s;t the People, in time, &s;hould have been reconcil'd to the Practice, and taken the Benefit of it.</P>
<P>And upon <HI>July</HI> the 21&s;t, 1721, being a third time call'd to an Account for u&s;ing this Practice by &s;ome Gentlemen (influenced thereto) who bore Authority in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> I then having &s;even Per&s;ons more under Inoculation, who&s;e Illne&s;s were not yet come on: I then gave a publick Invitation to the Practitioners of the Town
<PB N="4" REF="003259_0017_0FF02D406B751F40">(who were then pre&s;ent) to vi&s;it my Patients, who were under that Practice, and to judge of and report their Circum&s;tances as they found them. But Dr. <HI>Lawrence Dalhonde</HI>'s terrible Account (&s;ee the Account at the End) that he then gave of that Practice was &s;uch, that none of them &s;aw Cau&s;e to accept my Invitati|on and vi&s;it my Patients. In&s;tead of this, and reporting their Circum&s;tances ju&s;tly and fairly, as it was their Duty, and the People's Right, for them to have done, &s;ome of them made it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to invent, collect, and publi&s;h idle, unju&s;t, and ridiculous Stories and Mi&s;repre|&s;entations of the People's Circum&s;tances under it, and the Practice; tho' none of them had ever been concern'd for, or had &s;een one &s;ingle Per&s;on of them in their Illne&s;s, from the begin|ning of this Practice, to the end of it, except by Accident, &s;ave Mr. <HI>White</HI> once or twice, or that knew any thing of their Circum&s;tances, but that they &s;aw them come well and early abroad after their Small-Pox. And not &s;atisfy'd with &s;uch unju&s;t Proceedings in <HI>New-England,</HI> le&s;t the Truth &s;hou'd be made known to <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and that our good Succe&s;s might influence them to u&s;e this Practice, <HI>Dougla&s;s</HI> favour'd them with his pretended wonderful Knowledge of things which he knew little of, as may be &s;een in Dr. <HI>Wag&s;taff</HI>'s Book again&s;t Inoculation.</P>
<P>And as for <HI>Dalhonde</HI>'s mo&s;t &s;urprizing In&s;tan|ces, the knowing Part of Mankind now believes as little of them as if he had &s;aid that their Heads had dropt off, or that Inoculation had turn'd

<P>I have made diligent Enquiry in <HI>England,</HI> but cou'd never meet with any one who had heard of any &s;uch Practice in the&s;e Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> until within the&s;e five Years pa&s;t, or that believes there ever was, and e&s;pecially in an Ar|my, the mo&s;t unlikely Place to begin it in; and if began there, the mo&s;t likely Place he could have thought of to have made it publick to the World. So that if he does not get well-atte&s;ted Proofs from Drs. <HI>Helvetius, Bollatio,</HI> and <HI>Barre|ra,</HI> of the Facts, I doubt, for the future, his Affirmation will not have that Credit in the World, as an hone&s;t Man's ought to have.</P>
<P>The&s;e were &s;ome of the Oppo&s;itions and Dif|ficulties I met with in the Beginning of this Prac|tice, and which was the Means of keeping out hundreds, if not thou&s;ands, from coming into the Practice of Inoculation, which might have &s;aved many valuable Lives that were lo&s;t by the Small-Pox in the natural way, as may bet|ter appear when the Succe&s;s in each way is compared.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> the 12th, 1721, I inoculated Mr. <HI>Jo&s;hua Cheever,</HI> about 39 Years old. He had upon the 6th and 7th Days &s;ome light &s;hivering and fe|veri&s;h Turns, and upon the 8th they went off, the Scarifications being almo&s;t dried up, &s;o that we concluded the Operation had not taken effect.</P>
<P>On the 9th in the Evening (he being well) a Fire breaking out, he run with others to help put out the Fire, and in labouring at it, got wet
<PB N="6" REF="003259_0019_0FF02D43200AAEB8">with Water and Sweat, return'd home very ill and full of pain, and continued &s;o all Night; upon vi&s;iting him in the Morning, I found him un|der the &s;igns of a high Fever, a dry inflam'd Skin, full of Pain, with a hard and quick Pul&s;e, and I feared he would have had the Confluent Small Pox. He being lu&s;ty and &s;trong, I bled him largely, gave him a Vomit, and bli&s;ter'd him, upon which the Symptoms went off, and the Small-Pox came out of a kind di&s;tinct Sort, and his Pains, and our Fears, were &s;oon over, and in a &s;hort time he was well.</P>
<P>His Inoculations never inflam'd &amp; come to run, as is u&s;ual, but dry'd away almo&s;t from the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Until now, I u&s;ed the <HI>Turky</HI> Way of &s;carify|ing and applying the Nut-&s;hell, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which I &s;oon left off, and made an Inci&s;ion thro' the true Skin, and apply'd a Plai&s;ter over; which I found &s;ince to be the better Way.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> the 14th, I inoculated Mr. <HI>John Helyer,</HI> of about 34, and my Negro, <HI>Moll,</HI> of 37 Years old. Mr. <HI>Helyer</HI> had the Small-Pox at the u&s;ual time, and of a kind di&s;tinct Sort, the Symptoms gentle, and he &s;oon was well. <HI>Moll</HI> had a &s;low Fever a Day or two, and &s;ome Pain, which both went off, and her Inoculation &s;oon dry'd up: I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he had had the Small-Pox before; and the Rea&s;on why the Negro Man and &s;he was &s;o di&s;order'd from Inoculation, might be from their being expos'd to the Evening and Morning Air: The Weather being hot, I did not confine them before they complain'd.</P>
<P N="17">17th, I inoculated my Son <HI>John,</HI> about 13
<PB N="7" REF="003259_0020_0FF02D861B0878A0">Years old; he had the Small-Pox at the u&s;ual Time, a &s;mall &s;prinkling of a kind Sort, and the Symptoms gentle; but upon eating Milk, his No&s;e bled, and he appeared feveri&s;h. I forbad the Milk, and both left him. He being a Lover of Milk, a Day or two after, he had Milk and Water for his Drink, upon which his No&s;e bled, and flu&s;hing Heats return'd: After which, Milk was deny'd him, and the Symptoms went off and never return'd again. In lieu of Milk and Water, he drank Teas, which fini&s;h'd the Cure, and he was well.</P>
<P N="19">19th, I inoculated Mr. <HI>John Webb,</HI> about 67, Mr. <HI>Jo&s;eph Webb,</HI> 50, and his Wife 43 Years old. The elde&s;t and younge&s;t of the&s;e were weak infirm Per&s;ons, they all had the Small-Pox at the u&s;ual Time, and of the di&s;tinct Sort. Mr. <HI>John Webb</HI> had an ill turn of Faintne&s;s and Oppre&s;&s;ion of Spirits, at the coming out of the Pox; but when they were out, the Symptoms went off, and he, with the other two, pa&s;&s;ed gently thro' the Di&s;temper, and &s;oon were well.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> the 5th, I inoculated Mr. <HI>Larabee</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Hunt,</HI> each about 30, Mrs. <HI>E&s;ther Webb,</HI> 19, Mr. <HI>Cheever</HI>'s Lad, 16 Years old. Three of the&s;e had the Small-Pox at the u&s;ual Time, and of a good di&s;tinct Sort, their Symptoms gentle, and they &s;oon were well. Mrs. <HI>E&s;ther</HI> nurs'd her Father and Mother thro' the heighth of their Small-Pox, by Inoculation, before &s;he was inoculated; and they having it &s;o very favour|ably, it was hoped that &s;he had not taken the Infection of them; but we were &s;oon convinced of that Error, by her falling &s;ick and the break|ing
<PB N="8" REF="003259_0021_0FF02D4674CC76D8">out of the Confluent Small-Pox on the 4th or 5th Day after her Inoculation; and it was with a great deal of Care and Pains that &s;he liv'd thro' it. She al&s;o was re&s;tor'd to Health in a &s;hort time after.</P>
<P N="12">12th, I inoculated a young Gentlemen under 25 Years old, and much again&s;t my Inclination, this being the only In&s;tance in which I was oblig'd to Secrecy.</P>
<P>I inoculated Mr. <HI>Edward Langdon,</HI> 25, Mr. <HI>Larabee</HI>'s Servant-Man, about 18 Years old. They all three had the Small-Pox at the u&s;ual Time, and of a di&s;tinct Sort; the two la&s;t had but few in Number, and their Symptoms gentle. The young Gentleman had them pretty full, and (near the filling) for two Days, his Fever was brisk; but upon bleeding and the U&s;e of an <HI>Anodine,</HI> the Fever went off, and he, with the other two, were &s;oon recover'd to Health.</P>
<P N="22">22d, I inoculated Mr. <HI>Samuel Valentine,</HI> about 19 Years old; he had the Small-Pox at the u&s;ual Time, and of a kind di&s;tinct Sort, the Symptoms gentle; and he &s;oon did well.</P>
<P N="23">23d, I inoculated Mrs. <HI>Thornton,</HI> about 21 Years old; &s;he had the Small-Pox at the u&s;ual Time, an hand&s;ome &s;prinkling of a di&s;tinct Sort, and complained much of the Sorene&s;s; and her Pox continued longer on her than u&s;ual, before they fell off and dry'd away; the Symp|toms were gentle, and in a little Time &s;he was well.</P>
<P>I inoculated Mr. <HI>Nathaniel Langdon,</HI> of about 27, my Son <HI>Zabdiel,</HI> 14, Mrs. <HI>Margaret Langdon,</HI> 20, and Mrs. <HI>Joanna Syms</HI> of 15 Years
<PB N="9" REF="003259_0022_0FF02D8A4780D660">old. They all had the Small-Pox at the u&s;ual Time, of a very di&s;tinct Sort, their Symptoms gentle, and they &s;oon were well; tho' my Son lay two Nights in an infected Chamber before inoculated.</P>
<P N="30">30th, I inoculated Mr. <HI>John Colman,</HI> 18 Years old, and Mrs. <HI>Dixwell,</HI> about 37. Mr. <HI>Colman</HI> had a kind and favourable Small-Pox, as is com|mon in this Way, and &s;oon got well. Mrs. <HI>Dix|well</HI> was a fat Gentlewoman of a tender Con&s;ti|tution, &s;he came frightened into the Practice, as mo&s;t of the others had done; not only by living near the Infected, but pa&s;&s;ing &s;ome Days before by a Door wherein lay a Corp&s;e ready for the Grave, which died of the Confluent Small-Pox, the Stench whereof greatly offended and &s;ur|pri&s;ed her with Fear of being infected: How|ever, &s;he went the u&s;ual Time of nine Days be|fore Eruption, and broke out full of a di&s;tinct Sort; but being of a very moi&s;t Habit, they fluxed in her Face, about the 7th Day: She had a &s;ore Throat, was often re&s;tle&s;s, and by Turns had a Difficulty of Breathing, her Fever and Thir&s;t being yet moderate: The 11th, her Pox began to turn; the 13th, her Face became cru&s;ty; and the 14th, the Scabs began to fall off, and &s;he appear'd more comfortable; her Inci&s;ions grew wider, and run plentifully. All this while we were in good Hopes of her doing well. This Afternoon her two Children were brought to her, ju&s;t recovered in the natural way, which gave her great Joy, but put her Spirits into too great a Motion; and the Wea|ther changing cool (I apprehend) &s;he took
<PB N="10" REF="003259_0023_0FF02D4ACFED3D70">&s;ome cold, for that Evening &s;he was taken with hy&s;teric Fits, which held her about two Hours; but upon the U&s;e of an <HI>Anodine</HI> and &s;ome An|tihy&s;terics, &s;he became quiet, and re&s;ted &s;ome Hours that Night, and &s;eem'd refre&s;h'd in the Morning, and held it good part of the Day: But the Evening returning, brought on her Fits, together with a new Fever; upon which I bled her and repeated her Bli&s;ters, and u&s;ed many other Means, but to no Effect: The Fits and Fever followed her clo&s;e until the 17th of Eruption, and 26th from Inoculation, when &s;he died. <HI>Note,</HI> this was the only ca&s;e, wherein we met with Fits in all my Inoculated Pa|tients.</P>
<P N="31">31&s;t, I inoculated Mr. <HI>Samuel Jones,</HI> of about 32, and Mrs. <HI>Waldran</HI> of 35 Years old: The former had the Small-Pox at the u&s;ual Time, of a favourable di&s;tinct Sort, and was &s;oon well. Mrs. <HI>Waldron</HI> &s;uffer'd &s;ome light touches of a feveri&s;h Di&s;order on the 6th and 7th Days, and on the 8th they vani&s;h'd. Knowing (thro' her Fears) I had done it the fir&s;t Time but &s;light|ly, I then inoculated her again; which took Ef|fect, and at the u&s;ual Time produc'd a kind di|&s;tinct Pox, which &s;he ea&s;ily pa&s;s'd thro', and was &s;oon well.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> the 4th, I inoculated Mrs <HI>B&mdash;t,</HI> of about 32 Years old, upon a Pimple &s;he had &s;cratched off on one Arm, and on the other, where &s;he had prick'd the Skin, &s;o as to rai&s;e a &s;mall Drop of Blood: This Inoculation was attended only with &s;ome feveri&s;h turns, which upon the 8th Day vani&s;hed; and upon the 9th, her Fears being great le&s;t &s;he
<PB N="11" REF="003259_0024_0FF02D9005AEE908">&s;hould take it in the natural way, &s;he &s;uffer'd me to make the proper Inci&s;ions; after which at the 7th Day, her Fever came on, and the Small Pox came out on the 9th pretty full of the di|&s;tinct Sort: She had &s;omething more of a Fe|ver than is u&s;ual this way, and about the height of the Di&s;temper her <HI>Men&s;es</HI> came down, which added to her Unea&s;ine&s;&s;es a few Days; but all went over, and &s;he &s;oon got well. It was &s;trong|ly reported, that &s;he mi&s;carry'd; but upon &s;trict Inquiry of the Nur&s;e, I found it fal&s;e and groundle&s;s, &s;he not being then with Child.</P>
<P>I inoculated Mrs. <HI>Dodge,</HI> about 20 Years old, who had nur&s;ed her Si&s;ter, then lying &s;ick of the Confluent Small-Pox, until the 7th Day from her Eruption: She being terrify'd with the Cir|cum&s;tances of her Si&s;ter, I was per&s;uaded by her Mother and &s;elf to inoculate her, which I did, by way of Experiment: She had the Small-Pox at the u&s;ual Time, with very little Sickne&s;s or Pain, and &s;carce an hundred in all: She was &s;o &s;oon well, it could hardly be &s;aid &s;he had been &s;ick.</P>
<P N="5">5th, I inoculated Ju&s;tice <HI>Lynde's</HI> Negro Boy, about 17 Years old, he had the Small-Pox at the u&s;ual Time, and of a very kind di&s;tinct Sort, and &s;oon was well.</P>
<P N="6">6th, I inoculated my three Daughters, <HI>Jeru|&s;ha</HI> of about 10, <HI>Mary</HI> 8, and <HI>Elizabeth</HI> 4 Years old; the elde&s;t had but about 40 or 50, the other two were pretty full in their Faces; and all their Symptoms proving gentle, they &s;oon did well.</P>
<P N="7">7th, I inoculated Mr. <HI>Elias Adams,</HI> about 18 Years of Age, he had the Small-Pox at the com|mon
<PB N="12" REF="003259_0025_0FF02D4DF18F06E8">Time, and full of the di&s;tinct Sort; about the height, he was very re&s;tle&s;s and hot; but up|on the u&s;e of an oily Mixture and two bli&s;tering Plai&s;ters, the Symptoms went off, and he got &s;oon well.</P>
<P>I inoculated Mr. <HI>Abiel Walley</HI>'s Negro Girl, about 14 Years old; &s;he had the Small-Pox at the u&s;ual Time, of a kind di&s;tinct Sort, and was &s;oon well.</P>
<P N="8">8th, I inoculated Mrs. <HI>Pierce,</HI> about 32 Years old; &s;he had the Small-Pox at the u&s;ual Time, and of the di&s;tinct Sort, and &s;oon did well.</P>
<P N="9">9th, I inoculated Mr. <HI>Thomas Boy&s;ton,</HI> about 31 Years old; he had the Small-Pox at the u|&s;ual Time, and of a kind di&s;tinct Sort, a little fuller than ordinary this Way; but the Symp|toms proved gentle, and he &s;oon was well.</P>
<P>I inoculated Mrs. <HI>N&mdash;s,</HI> who had been co|ming into the Practice for &s;ome Time before, and had lived in the Way of Infection above a Month; but now, through Hope and Fear, tho' too late, &s;he &s;ubmitted to it. The 3d Day &s;he fell &s;ick; the 5th, the Small-Pox appeared, and continued coming out until the 8th or ninth, when &s;he was full of a &s;mall, depre&s;&s;ed, conflu|ent Sort, and her Throat was dry and &s;ore; &s;he had no immediate Signs of Danger until the 16th, (&s;he being, as it might be &s;uppo&s;ed, a breeding, and 8 or 9 Weeks gone) when her <HI>Men&s;es</HI> came down upon her, upon which her Strength failed, and her Spirits &s;unk. The 17th, &s;he flooded, and began to talk idly, conceiting &s;he was in the Waters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I vi&s;ited her about 12 that Night, and found her delirious, extream|ly
<PB N="13" REF="003259_0026_0FF02D918DD35A38">cold, and in a clammy Sweat, and her Pul&s;e &s;o low, that I could hardly be &s;en&s;ible &s;he had any at all; I ordered her &s;ome Drops of Oil of Cinnamon and Liquid <HI>Laudanum</HI> in Su|gar, (expecting little from a weaker Cordial) of which &s;he had given her two or three times that Night. I vi&s;ited in the Morning, &amp; found her much revived, and her flooding &s;tay'd; there was a &s;mall imperfect Sub&s;tance found in the Bed. Afterwards &s;he mended &s;lowly, a vi|olent Inflammation attending her Eyes, her Face being much &s;well'd, and her Eye-lids clo&s;ed; we were not &s;en&s;ible of the Danger, until the &s;harp Humour had ulcerated the horney Coat of one Eye the Sight of which &s;he lo&s;t; &s;he o|therways recovered and did well.</P>
<P N="11">11th, I inoculated Mrs. <HI>Jane Colman</HI> of about 14, and Mr. <HI>Grafton Feveryear</HI> of about 30 Years old; on both the&s;e the Small-Pox came out at the u&s;ual Time, of a kind di&s;tinct Sort, the Symptoms friendly, they &s;oon grew well. Mrs. <HI>Jane</HI> had about 50 or 60, Mr. <HI>Feveryear</HI> a good hand&s;ome Sprinkling; he had lived in an infected Hou&s;e about a Month before ino|culated.</P>
<P N="12">12th, I inoculated Mr. <HI>Daniel Berry</HI>'s Son, a|bout 20, and his Daughter about 16, and Mr. <HI>Mel|vin</HI> about 22 Years old: The&s;e three had the Small-Pox at the u&s;ual Time, of a kind di&s;tinct Sort, and they &s;oon were well.</P>
<P N="13">13th, I inoculated Mrs. <HI>Margaret Salter,</HI> about 30 Years old, a weakly hy&s;terical Woman, and often ill; and tho' &s;he had the Small-Pox ve|ry favourably, as to Number, yet &s;he complain'd
<PB N="14" REF="003259_0027_0FF02D5430B54CA0">much of Pain in her Head, and Vapours, which gave me &s;ome Trouble; but in a &s;hort Time tho&s;e Symptoms went off, and &s;he &s;oon was well.</P>
<P>I inoculated Mrs. <HI>Eliz. Melvin,</HI> about 19 Years old! &s;he had the Small-Pox at the u&s;ual Time, and of a kind di&s;tinct Sort, and &s;oon did well. She liv'd &s;ome di&s;tance from me, &s;o that I &s;aw her but twice after I inoculated her.</P>
<P N="16">16th, I inoculated Mr. <HI>John Adams</HI> about 35, and Mr. <HI>Jones's</HI> Child, 4 Years old; they both had the Small-Pox at the Time expected, few in Number, the Symptoms gentle, they &s;oon were well. Thro' Neglect, Mr. <HI>Adams</HI>'s Ino|culations inflamed, and became painful for 3 or 4 Days, but were afterwards ea&s;y, and &s;oon healed.</P>
<P>I inoculated Mrs. <HI>Adams</HI> about 30 and her Daughter about 4 Years old; it had no Effect upon Mrs. <HI>Adams,</HI> which a little &s;urprized me; and upon propo&s;ing to inoculate her again, &s;he &s;aid &s;he remember'd, when a little Girl, the Small-Pox was in her Father's Family, and &s;he ill, and that there was a Di&s;pute between the Doctor and Nur&s;e whether her's was the Small-Pox or not, having but three Pu&s;tles; the Mark of one &s;he &s;hewed me. I advis'd her to nur&s;e her Child, which was now ill, and be out of Fear; and &s;he did &s;o. The Child, at the u&s;ual Time, had the Small-Pox pretty full in the Face, and had a con&s;iderable Fever, attending. I gave it a Vomit, which o|ver work'd, and weaken'd it for the pre&s;ent, in&s;tead of relieving it: The Child continu'd very ill until about the 6th or 7th Day of

<P N="20">20th, I inoculated Mrs. <HI>Eliz.

<P N="21">21&s;t, I inoculated Mr. <HI>Nathaniel Ayres</HI> of a|bout 62, (he was a Gentleman very A&s;thmati|cal) his Son <HI>Nathaniel Ayres</HI> about 25, &amp; Mrs. <HI>Elizabeth Kitt</HI> about 22 Years old; &s;he had been in infected Hou&s;es and was taken down the next Day, had the Small-Pox full of a good Sort: The other two had the Small-Pox at the u&s;ual Time, of a very kind di&s;tinct Sort, and few in Number. The old Gentleman was in his Cloaths every Day, for his A&s;thma ren|der'd him uncomfortable in Bed. They all &s;oon recover'd and did well.</P>
<P N="22">22d, I inoculated Mrs. <HI>Woodbury,</HI> about 28 Years old; &s;he had the Small-Pox at the u&s;ual Time, of a kind, di&s;tinct Sort, the Symptoms gentle, and &s;he &s;oon was well.</P>
<P N="23">23d, I inoculated the Hon. <HI>Thomas Fitch,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q;</ABBR> his only Son, about 14 Years old; he had the Small-Pox at the u&s;ual Time, few in Number, the Smptoms ea&s;y, and he &s;oon was well.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="003259_0029_0FF02D5878D08E40"><HI>October</HI> the 6th, I inoculated Mrs. <HI>Eunice Wil|lard,</HI> about 22 Years old; &s;he had the Small-Pox at the u&s;ual Time, of a kind, di&s;tinct Sort, and was &s;oon well.</P>

<P N="27">27th, I inoculated Mr. <HI>Francis Foxcroft,</HI> of a|bout 30, Mr. <HI>Samuel Danforth</HI> 28, both of <HI>Cam|bridge</HI>; and at <HI>Roxbury</HI> the Reverend Mr. <HI>Nehe|miah Walter,</HI> about 58, and Daughter, 17, his Son, 12, and another Child about 7 Years old, the Reverend Mr. <HI>Thomas Walter</HI>'s Wife 23, Mr. <HI>Harbottle Dorr,</HI> 25, his Si&s;ter <HI>Clemence,</HI> 22, Eight of the&s;e had the Small-Pox at the u&s;ual Time, of a kind, di&s;tinct Sort, their Symptoms gentle, and they &s;oon were well. Mr. <HI>Walter's</HI> Inoculation had no Effect upon him. He &s;aid, when he was a Child he had an Illne&s;s, with breaking out, but they did not know that it was the Small-Pox. This his Mother told him when alive.</P>
<P N="28">28th, I inoculated Major <HI>Bowles</HI> of <HI>Roxbury,</HI> about 37 Years old; he had the Small-Pox at the u&s;ual Time, and of the di&s;tinct and favour|able Kind, and &s;oon was well.</P>

Mr. <HI>Bant</HI>'s Inoculation had no Effect upon him: I &s;hou'd have inocula|ted him again on the 8th or 9th Day, but that a Gentlewoman declar'd that &s;he had &s;een him &s;ick of the Small-Pox when a Child; his Mother hav|ing been dead &s;ome time, few remember'd any thing of it.</P>
<P>I inoculated Mr. <HI>John Pierpont,</HI> about 27 Years old; he had the Small-Pox at the u&s;ual Time, and of a very di&s;tinct Sort, an Inflamma|tion attending his Throat, gave him &s;ome Un|ea&s;ine&s;s for three or four Days after Eruption; but upon filling of the Pock the Inflammation went off, and he &s;oon recover'd; and did well.</P>
<P>I inoculated Mr. <HI>Edward Dorr</HI>'s other three Children, one of 9, and one of 7 Years, and the other about 18 Months old, his Servant Man 20, an <HI>Indian</HI> Girl about 17 Years old. Mr. <HI>Dorr</HI> would have had the&s;e five inoculated when he and the three Children were, but that I refus'd to do it then. But for the Convenience of nur&s;ing, they were put into one Chamber, and for better Stowage, two or three in one Bed, (the End of the Chamber being partition'd off for a private Lodging, in which was laid the <HI>Indian</HI> Girl) and by the time the fir&s;t three were broken out a Day or two, the other five began their Sickne&s;s. Here was a melancholy Sight indeed; I had of|ten three or four, but never nine in a Room to|gether; the poor Children with their &s;ickne&s;s and the Winter's Cold, prov'd froward, one cry|ing,
<PB N="26" REF="003259_0039_0FF02D681A64F540">another coughing; one wanted Drink, an|other to do its Needs; one to get up, another to go to Bed, and &s;o on; &s;o that together with o|pening and &s;hutting the Doors, the gingling of the Warming-pan, Fire-&s;hovel and Tongs, there was &s;carce a Minute in the 24 Hours that all was &s;till and quiet. They all had the Small-Pox at the u&s;ual Time, and of the di&s;tinct Sort: Mr. <HI>Dorr</HI> was full, his Pock inflam'd and his Fever too high: This, with his great Concern for his Children, the continual Noi&s;e, and Want of Sleep, made the poor Gentleman almo&s;t di&s;tracted, which obliged me to bleed him twice, to apply Epi&s;pa&s;tics, u&s;e Anodines, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> at the turning of the Pock, the Symptoms went off. The <HI>Indian</HI> Girl was taken ill the 7th with a gentle Fever, which continued to the 9th, when the Small-Pox came out upon her of a kind, di&s;tinct Sort, &s;he having about twenty in her Face, &s;o that &s;he was ea&s;y, and laughed, as I found her half naked, &s;it|ting up in the Bed. The 10th I vi&s;ited the Family late in the Evening, and the Nur&s;e &s;aid the <HI>Indian</HI> was very dull, and did not care to &s;peak; I found her very ill, the Pock &s;unk in, her Pul&s;e too frequent and un|even: I order'd her near a Fire, and ma|ny Means were u&s;ed to get the Pock out a|gain, but to no purpo&s;e; for &s;he died before Morning. Two of the Children were a little fuller than ordinary, complain'd of Sorene&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the other five had it very favourably, and eight of the nine recovered, and did very well. The Small-Pox had broken out in Mr. <HI>Dorr</HI>'s Hou&s;e before any of them were inoculated: Tho' I be|lieve
<PB N="27" REF="003259_0040_0FF02DA72D7659F8">the <HI>Indian</HI> Girl was no ways infected before, but was lo&s;t by taking Cold and &s;triking in the Pock. She was a weakly Girl, &s;ubject to Hu|mours breaking out upon her Years before.</P>
<P N="30">30th, I inoculated Mr. <HI>Thomas Smith,</HI> 19, Mr. <HI>John Smith,</HI> 17, Mr. <HI>Thomas Goodwin,</HI> 16, at <HI>Charle&s;ttown</HI>: Mr. <HI>Bra&s;ier</HI> about 31, his Wife 35, and four, of their Children, <HI>viz.</HI> one of 8, one of 6, one of 3 Years, and one of nine Months old; Mrs <HI>Wire</HI> about 50, and Son 14, Mr. <HI>Webb</HI>'s two Children, one of 2 Years, and the other 10 Months old, Mrs. <HI>Hendry</HI> 25 Years, and her Child 15 months old; All the&s;e Fifteen had the Small-Pox at the u&s;ual time, and of a very di&s;tinct and kind Sort. The three fir&s;t were in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> whom I often &s;aw, Mr. <HI>John Smith</HI> had but 3 Pu&s;tules that fill'd and turn'd, and but one of them very Fair, &s;o that I can't call this a perfect Small-Pox tho' I know not why the&s;e may not defend him for the Future, as well as if he had had but one or two in the natural way, the other two but very few: The twelve at <HI>Charle&s;town</HI> I &s;aw but twice in all their Illne&s;s, I was &s;o engaged in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> and <HI>Roxbury</HI>; however, they all &s;oon recover|ed, and did well.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> the 1&s;t, I inoculated Mrs. <HI>Foy</HI> 27, Mrs. <HI>White</HI> 24, and their Negro Boy 6, Mrs. <HI>Elizabeth Calf</HI> 16, her Si&s;ter 14, and Capt. <HI>Lang|don,</HI> 26 Years old; at <HI>Roxbury,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Scarbrough,</HI> Widow, 67, her Son <HI>Jo&s;eph Scarbrough</HI> 34, and Daughter <HI>Bethiah</HI> 22, Mr. <HI>Timothy Parker</HI> 26, Mr. <HI>Stephen Chute</HI> 22, Mr. <HI>Searl</HI>'s Servant Boy 16, Mr. <HI>Scarbrough</HI>'s Man, about 20 Years old.

But the&s;e Symp|toms abated as the Pox ripen'd; and as they turn'd, they went off. The Boy had but few in Number, and the Symptoms gentle. All the&s;e twelve &s;oon recover'd, and did well. Mrs. <HI>Be|thiah Scarbrough</HI> had her Illne&s;s begun the 7th Day, a gentle Fever, and &s;o continued until the 9th, when her Fever encrea&s;ed, and &s;he com|plain'd of her Head, Back, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as is u&s;ual, and no more; no Pox yet appearing; &s;he had Bli&s;t|ers order'd, and other Means pre&s;crib'd to bring out the Pox, and that &s;he &s;hould be kept warm in Bed, and &s;o I left her that Night. The next Night I found her (unexpectedly, in her Cloaths) upon the Bed, faint and weak, with a faulter|ing, weak, and dangerous Pul&s;e; and the Nur&s;e told me her Cour&s;es were upon her, and that &s;he could not keep her in Bed. I did the be&s;t I could for her, (being late at Night, and no Shop at Hand) but to no Effect; &s;he died be|fore Morning. She had been &s;everal Years, as her Mother and others told me, a very &s;ickly young Woman, and never well. In &s;hort, thro' my great Hurry, &s;he was poorly Doctor'd, and

Mr. <HI>Wells,</HI> his Daughter, and Mr. <HI>Serle</HI>'s Daughter, had the Small-Pox at the u&s;ual Time, and of the di&s;tinct Sort, but a little fuller, and their Com|plaints greater, <HI>viz.</HI> of Pain and Sorene&s;s, Want of Re&s;t, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which at the turning of the Pox, went off; and all the&s;e nine, in a little Time, recover'd and did well. Mrs. <HI>Wells</HI> was a ve|ry weakly Gentlewoman, always complaining and of an ill Habit of Body, and &s;o very &s;ple|netick as often to be deprived of Rea&s;on; and for many Years not capable of managing her Family Affairs. She had the Small-Pox at the u&s;ual Time, and of a very di&s;tinct Sort, and the Symptoms continued moderate for the fir&s;t five Days, &s;ave that the cold Weather pinched her very much; the 6th, 7th, and 8th Days &s;he was more unea&s;y, &s;lept but little, grew faint and weaker, the cold Weather affecting her &s;till
<PB N="30" REF="003259_0043_0FF02D6DA4171320">more, and the native Heat declining apace; the Pock not filling, &s;he &s;unk under it, and died the 9th from Eruption, and the 17th from her Inci|&s;ions. Mrs. <HI>Serle,</HI> likewi&s;e, was an ailing old Woman, Hy&s;terical, Splenetic, and of an ill Ha|bit of Body; &s;he had the Small-Pox at the u&s;u|al Time, and of a very di&s;tinct Sort; the Symp|toms were moderate, though &s;he was often com|plaining of one Unea&s;ine&s;s or other, as is com|mon in the Small-Pox, and the cold Weather, likewi&s;e, affected her much. Thus &s;he continu|ed until the Pock fill'd and turn'd, &amp; the Scabs ca&s;t off; one Day a little better, and another wor&s;e; &s;ometimes up, and other times in Bed: The Per&s;pirations being &s;topp'd by the cold Wea|ther, &amp; a Complication of Humours being put in Motion, at la&s;t fell upon her Bowels. She had a Purging three or four Days, which carried her off. She died the 24th from Eruption, and the 33d from Inoculation. All the&s;e 11 at <HI>Rox|bury</HI> had liv'd in the Way of Infection about three Weeks before inoculated.</P>
<P N="6">6th, I inoculated Mr. <HI>Bradford,</HI> 25, Mr. <HI>Jo|&s;eph Belcher</HI> about 22, his Brother, 18, Mr. <HI>Jo&s;.

<P N="8">8th, I inoculated, at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Harris</HI> about 22 Years old; &s;he had the Small-Pox at the u&s;ual Time, of the di&s;tinct Kind, and a

The old Gentleman, thro' the cold Weather, had an Inflammation in his Wri&s;ts, where he was Inoculated, which gave him much Pain, and me &s;ome Trouble. The Doctor, by the Cold, had a Tumour in the <HI>Axilla,</HI> which came to Suppuration. Except the&s;e two Acci|dents, (which &s;oon afterward were cured) they were very favourably dealt with, and &s;oon well.</P>
<P N="9">9th, I inoculated, in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Turell</HI> about 32, and a Negro Boy 10 Years old; they both had the Small-Pox at the u&s;ual Time, and of the di&s;tinct and kind Sort; their Symptoms gentle, they &s;oon were well.</P>

<P><HI>May</HI> the 11th, I inoculated Mr. <HI>Samuel Sewall</HI> of about 34, Mrs. <HI>Sewall</HI> 30, &amp; her two Sons, one 10, the other 8, Mr. <HI>Benjamin Woodbridge</HI> 13,

<P>The Small-Pox now leaving us, Inoculation ceas'd; and when it &s;hall plea&s;e Providence to &s;end &amp; &s;pread that Di&s;temper among&s;t us again, may Inoculation revive, be better received, and continued a Ble&s;&s;ing, in pre&s;erving many more from Mi&s;ery, Corruption, &amp; Death.</P>
<P>There were in the Towns near <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> about 36 Per&s;ons more inoculated, which all did well, <HI>viz.</HI> by Dr. <HI>Roby</HI> about 11, and by Dr. <HI>Thomp&s;on</HI> about 28, which together with my 247, make up the Number of 286, out of which Number died only &s;ix per&s;ons, notwith&s;tanding all the Difficulties this Practice laboured under, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>It appears by the foregoing Table, that Ino|culation upon &s;ix Per&s;ons did not produce the Small-Pox, by Rea&s;on they had had it before. And that out of 286, &s;ix died, though they had not all the Small-Pox only by Inoculation, as we have Rea&s;on to believe, but were &s;ome of them infected in the natural Way, before Ino|culated. And it further appears by our Prac|tice in <HI>New-England,</HI> that if a Number of Per|&s;ons
<PB N="35" REF="003259_0050_0FF02DB370A118C0">&s;hou'd be inoculated, of all Ages and Con|&s;titutions, and even &s;ome of them living among&s;t the Infected and in the wor&s;t Sea&s;ons of the Year, without Exception, as was our ca&s;e, then the Proportion that dies under Inoculation may be one in 46, or thereabout. It is my Opinion, from Rea&s;on, and as far as I can judge, from Experience too, that a Per&s;on may be infected in the natural Way, four or five Days, if not longer, before inoculated; and yet go the u&s;ual Time of nine Days before Eruption. And it is further my Opinion, that a Per&s;on may be &s;er|ved by Inoculation, if not infected above a Day or two before Inoculated. And the Rea|&s;ons for &s;uch my Opinions are as followeth: 1. That the Infection received by In&s;piration does not &s;o immediately enter into, and ferment the Blood and other Juices of the Body, as that does which we inoculate, or apply to the open|ed Blood and other Ve&s;&s;els in the Inci&s;ion. 2. That this inoculated Infection does immedi|ately enter in, and communicate its Leaven like Quality (by the Mouths of the divided Ve&s;&s;els) to the Ma&s;s of Humours in the Body. And if any there be of that Kind, it will ferment and put them into Motion, and bring the Small-Pox out in about two Thirds of the Time that the Natural u&s;ually does; and that before the deep, &s;ecret, and hidden Fermentations have had Time to divide and &s;ubdivide the Particles of that Humour, and by a greater Mixture de|prave the other Juices, &s;o as to produce the con|fluent Sort. I believe al&s;o that there is a Diffe|rence between the Particles of Infection, <HI>viz.</HI>
<PB N="36" REF="003259_0051_0FF02DDB4BF3FF60">tho&s;e in the natural Way, being more volatile, may be more malignant, than tho&s;e contain'd in the Pus or Matter of the Pu&s;tules: And that if there were no Difference in the Malignity of the Infection; yet as Inoculation communicates the Infection to an Out-&s;ide and firmer Part of our Body, the Malignity may (being &s;train'd thro' &s;o many minute Ve&s;&s;els) lo&s;e part of its Force, before it reach the more principal Parts, and that a part of that Infection may be di&s;|charged by the Inci&s;ions back again: Whereas in the natural Way, our No&s;trils, Throat, Mouth, Lungs, and Stomach are the fir&s;t Parts infect|ed; or thro' which the Infection pa&s;&s;es, and which are frequently the Parts that mo&s;t com|plain. And there may be &s;omething allow'd me (from Experience) on this Head, when I de|clare, that among&s;t the whole Number that I inoculated, tho' many of them amid&s;t the &s;tifling Heat of Infection, and in the extream hot and cold Weather; yet not above three or four Per|&s;ons had their Throats very &s;ore, and their Mouths fill'd, and No&s;trils &s;top'd with the Pock and Scabs, as are common in the natural Way. And I dare appeal to all that have been in this Practice, whether they have met with &s;uch a Ca&s;e, except the Per&s;on has been fir&s;t infected in the natural Way; which, indeed, may be a hard thing to determine, in any Place, where the Small-Pox may have been before the Per&s;on was inoculated. And yet notwith&s;tanding what I have &s;aid, as to le&s;&s;ening the Danger of a prior Infection, I would have the utmo&s;t Care taken to prevent Infection be|fore Inoculation: However, that may be of Ser|vice,
<PB N="37" REF="003259_0052_0FF02DB960509540">in Ca&s;e a Per&s;on may have been &s;o expos'd, either thro' Ignorance, or Nece&s;&s;ity. There is a &s;aying; that one Sort of Small-Pox the Nur&s;e can't kill the Patient with; and likewi&s;e another Sort, that all the Phy&s;icians cannot cure the Patient of. It will be ea&s;y for any one to gue&s;s what tho&s;e two Sorts are, <HI>viz.</HI> the Di&s;tinct, and the Confluent; the&s;e two are put in Oppo&s;ition to one another, as being the Extreams of each, <HI>viz.</HI> the be&s;t and wor&s;t Sort, or Kind of that Di|&s;temper. But however favourable the Small-Pox appear to be, there mu&s;t be Care taken of the Sick, and not only in this, but in all acute Di&s;ea&s;es; and e&s;pecially in tho&s;e call'd Eruptive Fevers, by Rea&s;on they are more expos'd to Ac|cidents, as taking Cold, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> flatting, or &s;triking in the Pock, or producing &s;ome other Symptom, which has co&s;t many thou&s;ands their Lives: Tho' the Small-Pox, Mea&s;les, or any other Fever the Patient had, may have &s;eem'd very gentle and ea&s;y; yet with a &s;mall Accident they are &s;natch'd away. And who wou'd have tho't it, &s;ays the Nur&s;e, if not the Doctor too. But &s;o it is, has, and will be, if not thro' great Care, Skill, and Pains, prevented.</P>
<P>Now Inoculation, at the wor&s;t, is but a Me|dium between the two Extreams, provided it be done according to Art, and the Patient be clear from a prior Infection; I &s;ay, it prevents the wor&s;t, and generally procures the be&s;t, or a kind, di&s;tinct Sort of Small-Pox.</P>
<P>And pray let us con&s;ider what this Method, in procuring the di&s;tinct Small-Pox, does prevent; it prevents the confluent, which, in it&s;elf, is a
<PB N="38" REF="003259_0053_0FF02DE0A5BA62E0">Plague, and that in a high Degree; &s;ome of the bad Symptoms attending which, are as followeth: Purple Spots, the bloody and parchment Pox, Hemorahages of Blood at the Mouth, No&s;e, Fundament, and Privities; Ravings and Deliri|ums; Convul&s;ions, and other Fits; violent in|flammations and Swellings in the Eyes and Throat; &s;o that they cannot &s;ee, or &s;carcely breathe, or &s;wallow any thing, to keep them from &s;tarving. Some looking as black as the Stock, others as white as a Sheet; in &s;ome, the Pock runs into Bli&s;ters, and the Skin &s;tripping off, leaves the Fle&s;h raw, like Creatures flea'd. Some have a burning, others a &s;marting Pain, as if in the Fire, or &s;calded with boiling Water: Some have in&s;atiable Thir&s;ts, others greedy Appetites, and will crave Food when dying. Some have been fill'd with loath&s;ome Ulcers; others have had deep, and fi&s;tulous Ulcers in their Bodies, or in their Limbs or Joints, with Rottenne&s;s of the Ligaments and Bones: Some who live are Cripples, othets Idiots, and many blind all their Days; be&s;ide the other Deformities it brings upon many, in their Faces, Limbs, or Body, with many more grievous Symptoms, which the World has had too great Experience of, as being the Attendants of that fatal Di&s;temper called the Confluent Small-Pox.</P>
<P>What this Humour of the Small-Pox, in us, is, or when, and how it is communicated to us, the Learned have not yet inform'd us. If from our Parents, then how &s;hou'd &s;uch as have had the Small-Pox before (and con&s;equently then have it not in them) give it to their Children's
<PB N="39" REF="003259_0054_0FF02DBD63B8DDF0">Neither are Infants in the Womb freed from that Di&s;temper, altho' the Mother have the Small-Pox while the Child is there. How|ever otherways it may be, this is certain, that as it is a mo&s;t loath&s;ome, painful, and de&s;truc|tive Di&s;temper; &s;o Providence has wi&s;ely and mercifully order'd it, that once only, in our Lives, we &s;hall be di&s;tre&s;s'd by it; &amp; has now, in greater Goodne&s;s, di&s;cover'd to us a Way or Method how to moderate that Di&s;temper, &amp; to render the Small-Pox, inoculated, no further dangerous than a common intermittent Fever, under the prudent u&s;e of its &s;pecifick Bark. And &s;hall not the World gratefully accept, &amp; thank|fully make u&s;e of &s;uch a Method, (when known) &amp; e&s;pecially <HI>Great Britain,</HI> which has had &s;o much Experience of its good Effects, and that for five Years following? Shall not they come fully into, &amp; take the Benefit of it? And &s;hall not the Phy&s;icians, who are the Medicinal Guides, with the Surgeons, recommend and bring it in|to greater E&s;teem &amp; Practice, &amp; &s;ave (under God) thou&s;ands and ten thou&s;ands by it; &amp; make further Improvements in it; &amp; &s;et more vigorou&s;ly about it, when they con&s;ider their great Pattern and Example for it, <HI>viz.</HI> the great|e&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of Kings, their Royal Highne&s;&s;es the Prince and Prince&s;s at the Head of it; &amp; that it has been u&s;ed upon their Royal I&s;&s;ue with great Succe&s;s?</P>
<P>The Small-Pox in the natural Way, has not been le&s;s fatal to Royal Blood, than it has been to their meaner Subjects; and &s;hall not &s;uch great Examples, and &s;uch great Succe&s;s, influ|ence
<PB N="40" REF="003259_0055_0FF02DE8E60C1CC0">the World, give Credit to, and recom|mend a Practice which is &s;o very valuable in it &s;elf, as that none other can compare with it?</P>
<P>When the World has had Experience of the good Effects of this Method, it will no longer remain a Doubt; but it will be made u&s;e of, and acknowledged to be the mo&s;t certain pro|curative Means to produce the better Sort; &amp; the only preventive Remedy again&s;t the wor&s;t and confluent Sort.</P>
<P>And it is, and &s;hall be acknowledged, to the Prai&s;e and Glory of God! that whereas a mo&s;t wild, cruel, fierce, and violent Di&s;temper, and which has de&s;troy'd Millions of Lives, is now (by that happy Di&s;covery made of its Tran&s;|plantation) become tractable, &s;afe, and gentle.</P>
<P>And it may be further &s;aid of this Practice, that if it were not to &s;ave the Life of one &s;in|gle Per&s;on in the Small-Pox, yet ina&s;much as it &s;aves from lo&s;s of Eye-&s;ight, a Sen&s;e &amp; Or|nament &s;o very valuable and dear to us, and from other Deformities, and from abundance of Pain and Mi&s;ery to the Sick, and from a great deal of Di&s;tre&s;s, Charge, and Trouble to the Well; &s;o it would, or ought to be thought, a valuable Practice, by &s;ome at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding we recommend this Method to be &s;o very favourable in it &s;elf; yet howe|ver, there ought and mu&s;t be ju&s;t Allowance given, why &s;ome are fuller, and have more complaints than others; as &s;ome may have it, more than others, in the Di&s;po&s;ition of their Blood, and other Juices, to produce larger Crops, and to bring on, and &s;ubject them to
<PB N="41" REF="003259_0056_0FF02DBEEB6705E0">more &amp; wor&s;e Complaints than others; and more e&s;pecially tho&s;e that come into the Practice loaded or filled with other Di&s;ea&s;es, not to men|tion ten thou&s;and Accidents we are expos'd to, more or le&s;s, each Day we live. And &s;hall In|oculation be charg'd with, and an&s;wer for the&s;e: No: It &s;hou'd rather be con&s;ider'd, how much wor&s;e it might have fared with them, if they had happened to have had it in the natural Way. And tho' it is look'd upon as Criminal, while now the Practice is but young, to u&s;e it upon infirm, and &s;ickly Per&s;ons; yet where &s;uch Per&s;ons are in Danger of taking the Infection in the natural Way, I think it much more criminal to refu&s;e &s;uch Subjects, and tru&s;t them to the Cru|elty of a mercile&s;s Di&s;temper, who have a much le&s;s Chance to get well thro' it, than tho&s;e who are of a more healthful and &s;tronger Con&s;tituti|on. But where they can be pre&s;erv'd from both, I think it highly ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hou'd. Women with Child, I wou'd have them to avoid the Small-Pox every way, but if they cannot, let them receive it by Tran&s;plantation, and it is my opinion that to &s;ave the fruit, it wou'd be be&s;t in the middle or later Months than before, and to &s;ave the Mother, at any time, rather than to have it in the natural Way. I &s;hall conclude this whole Account with &s;ome Directions, which may be of U&s;e and Service to the Unexperienced, in managing the inocula|ted Small-Pox, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="42" REF="003259_0057_0FF02DEA6CE44770">1 IF the Per&s;ons you wou'd inoculate are of ill Habits of Body, let them be fir&s;t purged, vomited, &amp; bled; one or other of the&s;e, if not all, as their Circum&s;tances may require, and repeated, as there may be Occa&s;ion, once, twice, or oftener; and be dieted for &s;ome Time, and that a Fort|night, more or le&s;s, as you may think proper, after they have done taking Phy&s;ick, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that they may have Time to recruit, and their Bodies to become &s;ettled before you bring a Di&s;temper on them.</P>
<P N="2">2. If they are of healthful Con&s;titutions, it may be as well to inoculate them without any previ|ous Preparation; for if they are ever &s;o well prepared, yet a &s;mall Accident may happen to put them into &s;uch Di&s;orders, or &s;uch Symptoms may ari&s;e, as may call for Bleeding, Vomiting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> although the&s;e have been u&s;ed but ju&s;t before: And I would ob&s;erve that in all my Number, there was not ten that had any Medicinal Pre|paration before the Operation was made upon them.</P>
<P N="3">3. Take your Medicine or Pus from the ripe Pu&s;tules of the Small-Pox, of the di&s;tinct Kind; either from tho&s;e in the natural Way, or from the inoculated Sort, provided the Per&s;on be otherwi&s;e healthful, and the Matter good. The Time when this Matter is fitte&s;t to be taken, is uncertain; in &s;ome it may be on the 9th, others on the 11th, 12th, 13th, or 14th, Day after
<PB N="43" REF="003259_0058_0FF02DC19B32B908">Eruption, and two, three, or four Days after the Pox is turn'd upon them; the be&s;t is white, even, and thick, and without &s;mell. My Way of taking it, is thus: Take a fine cut &s;harp Tooth-pick, (which will not put the Per&s;on in any Fear, as a Lancet will do many) and open the Pock on one &s;ide, &amp; pre&s;s the Boil, and &s;coop the Matter in your Quill &amp; &s;o on: When your Quill is full, empty it into a clean dry Viol, and &s;o take what you can, or what you have Occa&s;ion for; which keep clo&s;e &s;topp'd for U&s;e, and in a cool Place, except you are going to u&s;e it pre&s;ently; for Heat &s;oon ferments &amp; de&s;troys it. And &s;o long as it retains its white Colour, and even Con&s;i&s;tence, and that without &s;mell, you may depend it is good. And when it is otherwi&s;e, throw it away, wa&s;h your Viol very clean, or take a new one, before you gather any more.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Places I have made choice of to inocu|late in, for the Convenience of dre&s;&s;ing, are, <HI>viz.</HI> upon the out&s;ide of the Arm above the El|bow, and the in&s;ide of the Leg near, or in the Place where I&s;&s;ues are commonly made; and two Inci&s;ions are &s;ufficient for one Subject. Let the Inci&s;ions be made with a good Lancet thro' the true Skin, (by pinching of it up between your Fingers) a-cro&s;s the Fibres, and about a quarter of an Inch long, &s;uch as would receive a com|mon Pea in ca&s;e you were to make an I&s;&s;ue, and drop one full Drop (after wiping off the Blood) into the Inci&s;ion; or moi&s;ten a &s;mall bit of Lint in the Matter, and put that into the Inci&s;ion,
<PB N="44" REF="003259_0059_0FEFDA48C648BFD8">applying over it a &s;imple Diachylon Plai&s;ter, and gently bind it on with a Compre&s;s, Fillet, or Roller, and keep them in the Hou&s;e, and from the Air.</P>
<P N="5">5. The next, and &s;o every Day, dre&s;s with the &s;ame Plai&s;ter, or with Cabbage or Colewort Leaves, in order to dige&s;t, or bring them to run|ning Sores.</P>
<P>If at any Time an Inflammation &s;hould ari&s;e in or about the Inci&s;ions, or Pain and Swelling in the Arm-pit or Groin, apply hot Poultices made of white Bread and Milk, to the Sores, (and Swellings, if any there be) twice a day at lea&s;t; and &s;o continue them until the Inflam|mations, Pain, and Swellings go off or di&s;appear, which, if you keep your Patient warm, will be accompli&s;h'd &s;oon; continue tho&s;e Applicati|ons &s;ome Days after, lea&s;t the Symptoms &s;hould return.</P>
<P N="6">6. After they are inoculated, until the 4th or 5th Day, (unle&s;s they are ill before) let them eat and drink, &s;paringly, &s;uch Diet as u&s;ually they did before, and take gentle Exerci&s;e in their Chamber.</P>
<P N="7">7. When the Illne&s;s comes on, be it &s;ooner or later, with Sickne&s;s or Shiverings, flu&s;hing Heats, wandering, or other Pains, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> keep them war|mer, and from Fle&s;h and Fi&s;h of all Sorts, and Chee&s;e and Milk too: And if they appear much
<PB N="45" REF="003259_0060_0FF02DC8D886A408">out of Order, put them to Bed, darken the Room, and let them re&s;t. Now let them take all their Food, as Spoon-meat hot, and Drink aired; and if it be a young Child, it may have a Milk Diet, or Milk in its Pap or Gruel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. Let their Drink be Water with a well brown'd Toa&s;t in it, Barly-Water, or about a Thimbleful of Oatmeal, and four Spoonfuls of Milk boil'd in a Quart of good &s;oft Water, or common Teas, as they may be&s;t &s;uit your Pati|ent's Palate and Stomach; and &s;ome may be allow'd good White-Wine in their Drink, more or le&s;s, as their Stomach may require, &s;upporting them with innocent Spoon-Meats, and other Harmle&s;s Diet, and wait on Nature, ob&s;erving the Indications which &s;he may give you, and act accordingly; that is, if &s;he is oppre&s;t in any Part, and is not able to help her&s;elf, a&s;&s;i&s;t her; but if &s;he is not &s;o oppre&s;t, leave her to her&s;elf, for &s;he is the be&s;t Phy&s;ician, when able. And if you err, let it be in under, rather than in over-doing, for &s;uch Errors are ea&s;ier to reconcile, or be recover'd than the others are.</P>
<P N="9">9. Their Illne&s;s does u&s;ually begin on the 6th, &s;ome few on the 7th Day after Inocula|tion, and the Small-Pox break out on the 9th; it happens &s;ometimes to break out on other Days, tho' but &s;eldom. If your Patient has been ill two Days, and full of Complaints; as for In&s;tance, taken ill on the 6th, and the
<PB N="46" REF="003259_0061_0FF02DEEF13B2A28">Pox not out upon the 9th, give a gentle Vo|mit, either in the Morning or the Evening: And if the Small-Pox does not come out in 4, 6, or 8 Hours after, and the other Symp|toms do not abate, apply &s;ome bli&s;tering Plai|&s;ters, and, if Occa&s;ion, &s;ome drawing Appli|cations to the Feet, and renew them daily un|til the Patient is relieved, and the Symptoms are gone off. And for the better coming, and keeping out of the Pox, let them have <HI>Virgi|nian</HI> Snake-root, or Sheep's Dung Teas be|tween whiles, or a little Saffron or <HI>Ga&s;coine</HI>'s Powder, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. If they are hot and thir&s;ty, and the drink|ing plentifully of hot Teas, or other cooling &s;mall Drinks (as they may crave) does not take off tho&s;e Symptoms, and there appear Signs of In|flammation, take away &s;ome Blood, as the Age and &s;trength of the Patient may admit of, and the Ca&s;e require. You may bleed them, if full of Blood, and the Symptoms urgent, at any Time, <HI>viz.</HI> at the coming out, filling, or turn|ing of the Pox.</P>
<P N="11">11. Your chief Care in this Method &s;hould be at the beginning of their Sickne&s;s, to govern the Symptoms (if any bad ones &s;hould ari&s;e) in time, and to &s;ee that the Small-Pox does well come out; which you may know by the Patient's Ea&s;e and Quiet (except they are unea&s;y by their Sorene&s;s, which is not to be regarded) in order to accompli&s;h which, when wanting,
<PB N="47" REF="003259_0062_0FF02DCB9472E0E8">your Vomit and bli&s;tering Plai&s;ters, and &s;ome|times your Lancet, will be of great Service: But be very careful in your Vomits, le&s;t they over-work, weaken, and hurt your Patient, and your Reputation too: You had better give the Patient three or four, than one too &s;trong; therefore, if po&s;&s;ible, be &s;ure to know your Vomit. Antimonial are better than Ve|gitable Vomits, tho' not &s;o &s;afe and gentle.</P>
<P N="12">12. Do not be too free with Anodines, or Pacificks, at the Beginning of the Di&s;tem|per; more e&s;pecially, until there be proper Evacuation made: And if your Patient &s;hould be attended with more Fever than is nece&s;&s;a|ry, and want Re&s;t, give a Spoonful of the following oily Mixture, every four or five Hours, &s;haking the Viol well each Time of taking.</P>
<P><HI>Take of Oil of Sweet Almonds, new drawn, and Syrup of Mar&s;h Mallows, of each two or three Ounces, mixt in a Viol.</HI></P>
<P>Or if your Patient requires &s;omething more warm, Cordial, &amp; driving out, give them this, as follows,</P>
<P><HI>Take of Treacle and Plague Water, of each &s;ix Drachms; black Cherry Water, Oil of Sweet Almonds, and Syrup of Violets, of each one Ounce; of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Saffron, in Powder, ten Grains; Tincture of Ca&s;tor, one Drachm, mixt in a Viol.</HI></P>
<P>Let the Patient take of this, as there may be Occa&s;ion, &s;ooner or later in the Di&s;temper, at proper Intervals of Time, a &s;poonful, more or le&s;s, at once, in three, four, or five Hours
<PB N="48" REF="003259_0063_0FF02DF3B9574A70">Time, ob&s;erving to &s;hake the Viol each Time of taking. If your Patient nau&s;eates oily Mix|tures, give this in lieu of that above, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Take of Milk, or black Cherry Water, three Ounces; Treacle, or Plague Water, one Ounce; compound Piony Water, three Drachms; Diaphoretick Antimony, and <HI>Ga&s;coin</HI>'s Powder, each half a Drachm; Loaf Sugar, &s;ix Drachms, mixt in a Viol.</HI></P>
<P>If your Patient wants a Stool, procure one with a Suppo&s;itory; if too loo&s;e, check or &s;top it; their being a little bound may be well, but their being loo&s;e (except in Infants) may be hurtful.</P>
<P N="13">13. However, when there is a real Occa&s;ion for Anodines, you mu&s;t give them as in other Di&s;tempers; but Note, that there is not a Ne|ce&s;&s;ity for their common U&s;e here, as is pre&s;cri|bed in the natural Small-Pox; for this inocula|ted Small-Pox does not affect the Brain and <HI>Vi&s;cera,</HI> or corrupt the Blood and other Juices, as the natural commonly does. And in many there is no more Fever than is nece&s;&s;ary, or o|ther Symptoms, that ju&s;tly may require &s;uch Medicines. And in others, where there is a Shew of &s;uch Symptoms, they may go off at the coming out of the Pox, or at three or four Days after the Pox is out, and never return again, as I have often &s;een.</P>
<P N="14">14. I have given but few Receipts, or direct|ed to but few Medicines; yet more, I hope, than there will be Occa&s;ion for to make U&s;e of in one of twenty Patients in this Method; and becau&s;e I know there is no Want of Pre&s;crip|tions in the Small-Pox, they being already gi|ven
<PB N="49" REF="003259_0064_0FF02DCFA83D3560">by others; and that the Phy&s;ician, in Ca|&s;es of Difficulty, will u&s;e his own Judgment, and order what he thinks mo&s;t proper to &s;uit the Ca&s;e, and help his Patient.</P>
<P N="15">15. Generally &s;peaking, (if your Patients are of tolerable Habits, and came into the Practice free from a prior Infection) you will have but little to do, after Eruption, but to watch again&s;t Accidents, and regulate the nur|&s;ing Part; and when any new Symptoms do ari&s;e, make diligent Enquiry, and con&s;ider well from what Cau&s;e they proceed; if you can find it out, the Remedy may be near at Hand, <HI>viz.</HI> if from any Thing you have pre&s;cribed that did not &s;uit the Patient, forbid the further U&s;e; and, if nece&s;&s;ary, order &s;omething that may &s;et all right: If from a Fault in Nur&s;ing, let that be rectify'd, <HI>viz.</HI> in Meat, Drink, or Cloath|ing, up or in Bed, too many or too few; and if they have taken cold, nur&s;e the Part where the Cold began, by adding more Coverings to keep it warm, (be it in one Part of the Body, or other) as well as order &s;uitable Diet and proper Medicine.</P>
<P>Such Rules well ob&s;erved, may &s;ave you much Trouble, and the Patient much Pain and Sick|ne&s;s, and his Life too, in many other Di&s;ea&s;es, as well as in this of the inoculated Small-Pox.</P>
<P>There &s;hould be great Care taken in inocula|ting, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Medicine be good, and that the Inci&s;ions be made thro' the true Skin, le&s;t the Operation &s;hould prove fruitle&s;s, and the Patient afterward &s;hould take it in the other Way; as two of mine might have done, had I
<PB N="50" REF="003259_0065_0FF02DF826260978">not, in Time, inoculated them again, and &s;o prevented that Misfortune.</P>
<P>In ca&s;e you &s;hould have, thro' ill Habits of Body, or the like, any of your Inoculations that will not give way to, and heal with white Bread and Milk, treat them as you would do other common Sores, <HI>viz.</HI> with Fomentations and &s;tronger Dige&s;tives, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>_AS this was a melancholy day to Inoculation, in its infancy, that &s;o many appear'd (who were &s;uppos'd Judges) to oppo&s;e and condemn it, and the following Print coming out &s;o powerful and &s;trong again&s;t it, which was &s;ufficient to inflame and &s;et almo&s;t the whole Town and Coun|try again&s;t me and this Method; and whereas it has been indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread abroad, doing Mi&s;chief in the World where it came, I thought it ju&s;t and proper to confront it with my own Account, that it might in &s;ome Mea&s;ure prevent tho&s;e ill Effects for the future.</P>
<Q><TEXT>
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="part">
<P><HI>This</HI><DATE>21<HI>&s;t of</HI> July, 1721</DATE>. <HI>Four Clock,</HI> P. M.
Being &s;ummoned by Authority to appear at the Town-Hou&s;e in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> before the Select-Men of the &s;aid Town, to give an Account of what might come to my Knowledge in Relation to the Ope|ration called <HI>Inoculation,</HI> lately practi&s;ed in this Town by Dr. <HI>Boyl&s;tone</HI> of this Place.</P>
<P><HI>The fir&s;t In&s;tance.</HI></P>
<P>ABout twenty five Years ago I was at <HI>Cremona,</HI> in <HI>Italy</HI> in the <HI>French</HI> Army, where there were thirteen Soldiers upon whom this Operation was performed, of which Operation four died, &s;ix reco|ver'd with abundance of Trouble and Care, being &s;eiz'd with Parotidal Tumours and a large Inflam|mation in the Throat; one of them was open'd, his Diaphragm was found livid, the Glans of the Pancreas tumify'd, and the Caul gangreen'd. On the other three the Operation had no Effect.</P>
<P><HI>The Second In&s;tance.</HI></P>
<P>In the Year 1701, being in <HI>Flanders,</HI> there was committed to my Care, by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Le Duc de Guiche</HI> Col. of Dragoons, one Capt. <HI>Hu&s;&s;art,</HI> taken ill of the Small-Pox, who told me in the&s;e very Words, <HI>Ten Years ago I was inoculated five or &s;ix times, with|out that cur&s;ed Invention's taking Effect upon me; Mu&s;t I then peri&s;h</HI>? He was &s;o violently &s;eized, that
<PB N="52" REF="003259_0067_0FF02DFA0FA2B368" MS="y">he had &s;everal Ulcers on his Body, e&s;pecially one on his Arm, which occa&s;ion'd a Lamene&s;s thereof for Life. It was not the Fault of the Care of the Surgeon, Major of the Regiment, <HI>De Guiche,</HI> and &s;everal other Surgeons who came frequently to vi|&s;it him.</P>
<P><HI>The Third In&s;tance.</HI></P>
<P>At the Battel of <HI>Almanza</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> the Small-Pox being in the Army, two <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Soldiers had the Operation perform'd upon them; one recover'd, the other receiving no Impre&s;&s;ion, but &s;ix Weeks thereafter was &s;eiz'd with a Frenzy, &s;welled all over his Body. They not calling to Mind that the O|peration had been perform'd upon him, believed that he was poi&s;oned. It was order'd by Dr. <HI>Hel|vetius</HI> Phy&s;ician to his Royal Highne&s;s the Duke of <HI>Orleans, Don Larencio Bollatio, Don Bentura Bar|rera,</HI> two of the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Phy&s;icians, that the Body &s;hould be opened; his Lungs were found ul|cerated, from whence they concluded that it was the Effect of that Corruption which having infect|ed the Limphae, did throw it &s;elf upon that Vital Part, which occa&s;ion'd his &s;udden Death.</P>

<P>At a Meeting by Publick Authority in the Town-Hou&s;e of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> before His Maje&s;ty's Ju&s;tices of the Peace and the Select-Men; the Practitioners of Phy&s;ick and Surgery being called before them, concerning <HI>Inocula|tion,</HI> agreed to the following Conclusion.</P>
<P>A Re&s;olve upon a Debate held by the Phy&s;icians of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> concerning Inoculating the Small-Pox, on the twenty fir&s;t Day of <HI>July,</HI> 1721.</P>
<P>IT appears by numerous In&s;tances, That it has prov'd the Death of many Per&s;ons &s;oon after the Operation, and brought Di&s;tempers upon many o|thers which have in the End prov'd deadly to 'em.</P>
<P>That the natural tendency of infu&s;ing &s;uch malig|nant Filth in the Ma&s;s of Blood, is to corrupt and putrify it, &amp; if there be not a &s;ufficient Di&s;charge of that Malignity by the Place of Inci&s;ion, or el&s;ewhere, it lays a Foundation for many dangerous Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>That the Operation tends to &s;pread and continue the Infection in a Place longer than it might other|wi&s;e be.</P>
<P>That the continuing the Operation among us is likely to prove of mo&s;t dangerous Con&s;equence.</P>
