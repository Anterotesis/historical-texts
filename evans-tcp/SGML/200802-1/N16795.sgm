<P>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Wil&s;on having received a Call from a Church in Charle&s;ton, South Carolina, was advi&s;ed by &s;everal Phy&s;icians that a Southern climate would prove more favourable to his con&s;titution, and was at pre&s;ent ne|ce&s;&s;ary for his health. This occa&s;ioned his leaving New-York, which he did with the &s;incere&s;t regret. The following is his FAREWELL SERMON, preached to a very numerous Audience, <HI>January</HI> 27<HI>th,</HI> 1788, and now publi&s;hed at the reque&s;t of many in the Congregation.</NOTE></P></Q>

<P>JESUS CHRIST is &s;tiled, the Son of peace; and the di&s;pen&s;ation of grace, through him, is called the Go&s;pel of peace. True, on a particular occa&s;ion, he told his di&s;ciples, that he came not to &s;end peace on earth but a &s;word: And the hi&s;tory of man, &s;ince his appearance, hath fully evinced the prediction. Abu&s;ing this glo|rious di&s;pen&s;ation of mercy, the wicked
<PB N="6" REF="021614_0004_0FB41CDA358BA058">
and de&s;igning, as well as ignorant and mi&s;informed pious men, have made it the &s;ource of contention and &s;trife; &s;o that the father hath frequently been found again&s;t the &s;on, and the &s;on again&s;t the father, in religious conte&s;ts. But although blind or wicked zeal hath often kindled into the wrath of man, which worketh not the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God; yet &s;till the native tendency of the Go&s;pel is peace: And it mu&s;t be perverted and abu&s;ed before it can engender any other than the &s;pirit of love.</P>
<P>As, under the Redeemer's gentle reign, the Wolf &s;hall dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard &s;hall lie down with the Kid, we find Angels celebrate the birth of the Prince of peace, with this &s;eraphic &s;ong, Glory to God in the highe&s;t, and on earth peace, good will towards men. Not only was he u&s;hered into the world with the &s;ong of peace, but, at his departure to the Father, he bequeathed peace, as his la&s;t legacy to the di&s;ciples whom he had cho&s;en.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle John, whom the Son of God di&s;tingui&s;hed as the object of his peculiar affection, has given us the fulle&s;t account of the di&s;cour&s;es which Chri&s;t held with his di&s;ciples immediately before his pa&s;&s;ion. The&s;e have ever been reckoned
<PB N="7" REF="021614_0005_0FB41CDC77BF3998">
of great importance by all the genuine followers of the Lamb. In the affecting moments of parting, when the Son of man &s;aid, hereafter I will not talk much with you, behold him benignly &s;aying, Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you.</P>
<P>In di&s;cour&s;ing a little from the&s;e words, it is propo&s;ed, through the ble&s;&s;ing and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of God, to enquire what is implied in the expre&s;&s;ions, Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you; and then make &s;ome &s;hort practical improvement of what may be &s;aid.</P>
<P N="1">I. It is propo&s;ed to enquire what is implied in the expre&s;&s;ions, Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you. A very little attention will convince us, that more is implied in the text than in the common parting-&s;alutation, peace be with you. Chri&s;t gave not as the world giveth. My peace &s;ugge&s;ts unto us, that he is the author of it, and that he can freely be&s;tow it as his own. This ver&s;e was by no means intended for the Apo&s;tles alone. All, who call upon the name of the Lord Je&s;us, in every place and age, are equally inter|e&s;ted in it. Con&s;idering the text then as if the great Redeemer had immediately addre&s;&s;ed it unto you, we think it implies in it the following things.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="8" REF="021614_0006_0FB41CDDF5876650">1&s;t. Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you, implies, that Chri&s;t hath procured, for all his people, peace with God. We ought carefully to guard again&s;t thinking that God hates any of the works he hath made. God is love. His tender mercies are over all his works. His every creature &s;hares in his bounty, and partakes of his diffu&s;ive goodne&s;s. But, by the wi&s;e and righteous con&s;titution of the govern|ment of the King eternal, immortal, invi|&s;ible, mi&s;ery nece&s;&s;arily follows tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ion. In the language of &s;cripture, this mi&s;ery is called the wrath of God, and his vengeance. There is no peace to the wicked. Our God is a con&s;uming fire.</P>
<P>When our &s;ins are pardoned, we are &s;aid to be reconciled unto God, and to have peace with him. Thus the royal P&s;almi&s;t &s;ays, Thou ha&s;t forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou ha&s;t covered all their Sin. Selah. Thou ha&s;t taken away all thy wrath: thou ha&s;t turned thy&s;elf from the fiercene&s;s of thine anger. Turn us, O God of our &s;alvation, and cau&s;e thine anger towards us to cea&s;e. Now it is in con&s;equence of the atonement of Je&s;us Chri&s;t alone that our &s;ins are forgiven. He is our peace. Through this man is preached unto you the forgivene&s;s of &s;ins: and by him all that be|lieve are ju&s;tified from all things, from
<PB N="9" REF="021614_0007_0FB41CDF759208F8">
which ye could not be ju&s;tified by the law of Mo&s;es. But being ju&s;tified by faith, we have peace with God, through the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t: for there is now no condem|nation to them who are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who walk, not after the fle&s;h, but after the &s;pirit. Well, therefore, might Chri&s;t &s;ay, as in the text, Peace I leave with you. The &s;oul-reviving news of pardon, of reconciliation with God, are &s;till &s;ounded in the Church. The great bu&s;ine&s;s of the Go&s;pel mini&s;try is, to te&s;tify repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. The tenor of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t is, He that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved: for him hath God exalted to be a prince, and a &s;aviour, for to give repentance to I&s;rael, and forgivene&s;s; of &s;ins.</P>
<P N="2">2d. Peace I leave with you, my peace give unto you, implies, that Chri&s;t be&s;tows. on all his people, inward tranquility and peace. It is too notorious to be de|nied, that we are guilty creatures. Guilt nece&s;&s;arily begets fear, and rai&s;es in the mind the mo&s;t tormenting emotions. It is po&s;&s;ible, by long habits or wickedne&s;s, to have the con&s;cience feared as with a hot iron. But however much temporary ea&s;e a per&s;on in this &s;ituation may feel, he is very far from true peace. The ab&s;ence of remor&s;e or the freedom from de&s;pair, is
<PB N="10" REF="021614_0008_0FB41CE1E0A47200">
owing to an unhappy habit, the &s;inner too ea&s;ily acquires, of turning off his attention from his true character; and keeping him&s;elf from reflecting on the con&s;equences of his conduct. The peace, which the exalted Saviour gives, is very different, and founded on a &s;olid, on an immove|able ba&s;is.</P>
<P>Every man, who becomes a di&s;ciple of Je&s;us, mu&s;t be made, in &s;ome con&s;iderable degree, to know him&s;elf. He mu&s;t feel that he is guilty, wretched and hateful. The true penitent views his &s;ins accom|panied with their di&s;tre&s;sful circum&s;tances of aggravation. He &s;ees that the law, which he hath &s;o wantonly broken, is not only righteous, but good and holy. Thus he lothes and abhors him&s;elf in du&s;t and a&s;hes. But when his heart is &s;prinkled from an evil con&s;cience, he feels the ble&s;&s;|edne&s;s of the man who&s;e &s;ins are pardoned, who&s;e iniquities are covered, to whom the Lord will not impute &s;in. A &s;en&s;e of guilt alarms. But when the &s;inner, knowing that a man is not ju&s;tified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, believes in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. that he may be ju&s;tified by the faith of Chri&s;t and not by the works of the law, he re&s;ts on a &s;ure and tried foundation. He believeth on him that ju&s;tified the ungodly. He fleeth for refuge
<PB N="11" REF="021614_0009_0FB41CE337AB57C0">
to lay hold on the hope &s;et before him in the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Now he feels that there is none to condemn, but can according to the mea&s;ure and &s;trength of his faith, adopt the ani|mated language of the Apo&s;tle; Who &s;hall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that ju&s;tifieth: Who is he that condemneth? It is Chri&s;t that died, yea, rather, that is ri&s;en again, who is even at the right hand of God, who al&s;o madeth inter|ce&s;&s;ion for us. Here is peace which is the peculiar gift of the de&s;pi&s;ed Nazarene. The blood of Je&s;us clean&s;eth from all &s;in. It &s;peaketh peace to the guilty mind. It allays the fever of an upbraiding con&s;cience. It di&s;|pels the fears of condemnation, and makes us know that God is love. For we have not received the Spirit of bondage again to fear; but we have received the Spirit of adoption whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</P>
<P>It de&s;erves our attention, that, in the ver&s;e preceding our text, the Lord mentions the Comforter, which is the Holy Gho&s;t, with|out who&s;e agency no &s;inner can enter into the Kingdom of God. He &s;hall teach you all things and bring all things to your remem|brance what&s;oever I have &s;aid unto you. Sin hath &s;et our powers and faculties at vari|ance. The inward part of the ungodly is all confu&s;ion and turmoil. It is true one violent
<PB N="12" REF="021614_0010_0FB41CE4B6874250">
pa&s;&s;ion after another u&s;urps the &s;way, and, during its imperious reign, overpowers all oppo&s;ition, and bids defiance to all controul. Yet even in this &s;ituation, when all &s;eems to move in one direction, the &s;oul is full of di&s;quiet. But it more frequently happens, that violent propen&s;ities and pa&s;&s;ions urge at once their oppo&s;ite and irreconciliable claims. Here the man without &s;elf-govern|ment is, like a &s;hip which has lo&s;t its rudder, driven by furious winds, while the tran&s;ient gratification of each pa&s;&s;ion, like the cla&s;hing of contending billows, va&s;tly increa&s;es the uproar and confu&s;ion within.</P>
<P>But, when the divine Comforter reneweth the heart, the unruly propen&s;ities, pa&s;&s;ions and lu&s;ts lo&s;e their ferocity. Then the mind, recovered to a &s;en&s;e of her immortal dignity, re&s;umes her rightful &s;way. The inferior appetites are taught to know their proper place. The objects, which kindled ambition, or avarice, or lu&s;t, no longer gli&s;ter in their wonted charms. The opening glories of eternity captivate the Believer's heart. The powers of the world to come &s;en&s;ibly influence him. A new &s;eries of activity engages all his faculties and de&s;troys the unworthy conte&s;ts which formerly rent his heart. May not the Son of God then &s;ay, Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you, when rea&s;on,
<PB N="13" REF="021614_0011_0FB41CE648DADC68">
con&s;cience, inclination, and all our powers lead to the &s;ervice of God; when the whole man is employed in righteou&s;ne&s;s, the fruit of which is peace.</P>
<P N="3">3d. Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you, implies, that Chri&s;tians be at peace with one another. The character, which the Apo&s;tle gives of them who are without God and without hope in the world, is, that they are hateful, and hating one another. When a man is full of con|fu&s;ion within; when the &s;lighte&s;t degree of &s;elf-examination pre&s;ents to him a mon&s;ter, on which he cannot bear to fix his eye, he mu&s;t be irra&s;cible and unlovely. And, though the fear of encountering the fierce pa&s;&s;ions of others, which he knows to be as ungovernable as his own, may make him act with caution; yet he cannot be &s;aid to be at peace with others who is at enmity with him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t not only po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t undi&s;|turbed tranquillity within him&s;elf, but he was at all times actuated by the pure&s;t be|nevolence and good will towards all men. The expre&s;&s;ions of the text may mean, that he hath left us an example of peace, which it is our duty and intere&s;t to imitate. But it implies much more than this.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t hath taken away every cau&s;e of contention among his followers. Wars and
<PB N="14" REF="021614_0012_0FB41CE7B5CA6A90">
&s;ightings among men come from their lu&s;ts, which war again&s;t the Spirit. But the lu&s;ts of the humble followers of the Lamb are &s;ubdued. Pride is another fruitful &s;ource of contention and &s;trife: But they, who learn of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, are humble, meek and lowly. They think not of them&s;elves above what they ought to think, but e&s;teem each other better than them&s;elves. Self-conceit hath often inter|rupted the happine&s;s of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The great Author and fini&s;her of our faith hath extingui&s;hed one of the greate&s;t cau&s;es of contention, by giving his followers a certain and fixed &s;tandard of wi&s;dom. While every man followed his own crude conceptions, and deemed his own mind the &s;eat of perfection, there was wrangling and di&s;putes without end. Now we can appeal to the law and to the te&s;timony: and we know that, if any man &s;peak not according to them, there is no truth in him. Many hot di&s;putes have, no doubt, been kindled in the Chri&s;tian world about the meaning of the &s;acred oracles. All the&s;e however are foreign to the &s;y&s;tem of peace. It appears, but too evidently, that the di&s;pu|tants, equally di&s;&s;atisfied with &s;cripture, wi&s;h to &s;ub&s;titute their own modes of expre&s;&s;ions, and under the&s;e their own conceits, in the room of the word of God.
<PB N="15" REF="021614_0013_0FB41CE937C129B0">
On the other hand the true Chri&s;tian is &s;atisfied to receive divine truth in the very words which the Holy Gho&s;t teacheth. He holds the unity of the faith in the bond of peace; and finds his time and attention &s;o completely engro&s;&s;ed with regulating his conduct by the word of God, that he hath no lei&s;ure for angry cavils with any man.</P>
<P>Mutual neglects and injuries mu&s;t be expected, in this imperfect &s;tate, as the unavoidable concomitants of humanity. The true Chri&s;tian, like his divine ma&s;ter, is of a meek and forgiving temper. He hath learned, when he is reviled, not to revile again. He owes no man any thing but to love one another. He overcometh evil with good. It is true many, who only come to &s;py out our liberty in Chri&s;t, take upon them&s;elves the venerable name of Chri&s;tian, while they are utter &s;trangers to this divine temper. But, as the&s;e are none of Chri&s;t's, we are to expect, no peace in them or from them.</P>
<P>Now, &s;eeing the native tendency of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t is peace; peace with God, with our&s;elves and with one another: And, &s;eeing it is impo&s;&s;ible to have di&s;putings, &s;trifes and contentions, without relinqui&s;h|ing all title to the character of Chri&s;tians, we &s;ee the truth, the meaning, and the
<PB N="16" REF="021614_0014_0FB41CEAC74F8560">
propriety of the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you.</P>
<P N="2">II. And now, my Brethren, as the im|provement of what hath been &s;aid, &s;uffer me to exhort you all to &s;eek peace. Every per|&s;on pre&s;ent knows the importance of inward tranquility. There is however no peace to the wicked. If you wi&s;h to be in the de|lightful &s;ituation that your own con&s;ciences condemn you not, &s;eek peace and recon|cillation with God, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>This is the true, this is the &s;ole founda|tion of happine&s;s. He, who looks for it from any other quarter, is like a man who builds his hou&s;e upon the &s;and.</P>
<P>Peace and reconciliation with God will not only by the foundation of internal tran|quility, but it will lead you to be at peace among your&s;elves. That chri&s;tian &s;ociety may be called a church of God, where the Son of peace dwells. I be&s;eech you therefore, brethren, by the name of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that you all &s;peak the &s;ame thing, and that there be no divi&s;ions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the &s;ame mind, and in the &s;ame judgement.</P>
<P>Mutual forbearance mu&s;t be the bond of peace among men. O remember that we are all imperfect. We &s;ee but in part; we know but in part. Let each of us &s;tudy to approve our&s;elves to God through Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and
<PB N="17" REF="021614_0015_0FB41CEC363B3D60">
then the only contention, if it be lawful to give it &s;o hard a name, will be who can forbear, who can yield, and who can love the mo&s;t.</P>
<P>My dearly beloved Brethren, in all pro|bability, we &s;hall meet no more, till we are a&s;&s;embled before the la&s;t tribunal. It is im|po&s;&s;ible, without emotion, to anticipate this awful &s;cene. For more than three years I have now laboured among you in the Go&s;|pel mini&s;try. God knows, and you al&s;o know, that I have not been able, at all times, to re&s;train the tears, which involun|tarily force them&s;elves from my eyes, when I figure, only in imagination, you and my|&s;elf as taking our re&s;pective places at the judgment &s;eat of Chri&s;t. I dare not be &s;o bold as to &s;ay with the Apo&s;tle, I am pure from the blood of all men. How cutting the thought, that perhaps &s;ome of you may ri&s;e up in judgment again&s;t me; and that your blood &s;hall be required at my hand.</P>
<P>O thou compa&s;&s;ionate High Prie&s;t, who did&s;t &s;hed thy blood for our &s;alvation, who art my Ma&s;ter, who &s;hall be my judge, al|though I cannot &s;ay, before thee, that I have declared all the coun&s;el of God; yet I hope to be found of thee as one who never de|&s;ignedly &s;hunned to declare any part of his coun&s;els, and who&s;e &s;ingle aim, though with much imperfection, hath been to pro|mote
<PB N="18" REF="021614_0016_0FB41CEDB6257B10">
religion, righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace in this place, that I might pre&s;ent every man perfect in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P>Allow me, my Brethren, to &s;ay, that my fears for my&s;elf, however pungent and keen, often give way to my concern for you. It is po&s;&s;ible for Mini&s;ters to &s;ave their own &s;ouls, while their hearers, or &s;ome of their hearers, are ca&s;t out into utter darkne&s;s, where there is weeping and gna&s;h|ing of teeth. You know how that we have &s;hewed, and taught, from this &s;acred place, te&s;tifying, both to old and young, both to rich and poor, repentance towards God, and faith toward our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. It is awful to think, that perhaps the&s;e pews, which alas! are too often unfilled, may ri&s;e up in judgement again&s;t their holders, and convict &s;ome of you as per&s;ons who have judged your&s;elves unworthy of eternal life.</P>
<P>But, beloved, not the hearers of the law are ju&s;t before God, but the doers of the law &s;hall be ju&s;tified&punc; At the great day of Chri&s;t, he that &s;oweth to his fle&s;h, &s;hall of the fle&s;h reap corruption; but he that &s;oweth to the &s;pirit, &s;hall of the &s;pirit reap life ever|la&s;ting. Who&s;oever doth not righteou&s;ne&s;s is not of God; neither he that loveth not his brother. The&s;e things being &s;o, Oh! how di&s;tre&s;sful the thought, that I mu&s;t pro|bably witne&s;s, in the great day of accounts,
<PB N="19" REF="021614_0017_0FB41CEF358CADE0">
again&s;t &s;ome of you. If while you were pricked to the heart; if, while con&s;cience, joining i&s;&s;ue with the word, impre&s;&s;ed you with a deep &s;en&s;e of the nece&s;&s;ity of your union with Chri&s;t, you &s;tifled the convic|tion, and &s;till hold fa&s;t your iniquity, Oh! dream not of e&s;caping with impunity. Take heed how ye hear; for we mu&s;t all give an account of our&s;elves unto God. Follow peace with all men, and holine&s;s, without which no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord.</P>
<P>And now, my dear friends, before I take my leave of you, permit me, in this public manner, to return my mo&s;t &s;incere and hearty thanks, for the great affection and love with which you have always treated me. Many ha&s;ty compo&s;itions, and but ill-dige&s;ted thoughts have been delivered to you. No doubt &s;everal youthful indi&s;|cretions have, from time to time, appeared. But, in&s;tead of de&s;pi&s;ing my youth, your approbation has been &s;teady and &s;ure; yea, and you al&s;o afforded me the flattering, and I will add the &s;upporting, &s;en&s;e of it too.</P>
<P>You no doubt &s;aw, that your approba|tion was only a &s;econdary object, and that your &s;alvation was my con&s;tant and uniform aim. This nece&s;&s;arily led me to &s;ubjects of correction and reproof, as well as in&s;truc|tion in righteou&s;ne&s;s. I blu&s;h to own, that, on looking over &s;everal of the&s;e, I find, in
<PB N="20" REF="021614_0018_0FB41CF176255BD0">
many places, an a&s;perity of expre&s;&s;ion, which, to &s;ay the lea&s;t of it, favours but too much of the wrath of man, that worketh not the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God. All this notwith&s;tanding, there has been no inter|ruption of the harmony between us. Nay your love to me was, more and more, con|firmed; &s;o that I have &s;erved with you in the go&s;pel as a &s;on rather than a &s;tranger. This I have con&s;idered as no incon&s;iderable evidence, that my preaching among you hath not been altogether fruitle&s;s. For God is not the Author of confu&s;ion but of peace, as in all churches of the &s;aints. Your warm and unremitting kindne&s;s has often affec|ted, and &s;ometimes almo&s;t overcome me; &s;o I hope I &s;hall be excu&s;ed for adding, that I will bear you on my heart, while it continues to throb with the alternate emo|tions of grief and joy. And may the peace of God, which pa&s;&s;eth all under&s;tanding, keep your hearts and minds through Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P>While I devoutly pray, that the great Shepherd and Bi&s;hop of &s;ouls may be&s;tow upon you his be&s;t ble&s;&s;ings; and particu|larly that he may &s;oon give you another Mini&s;ter to di&s;pen&s;e in my room the Go&s;|pel of peace; permit me to remind you of the great obligations to gratitude, under which you lie, to the exalted Head of the

Church, for the continuance of the life, of the health, and of the u&s;efulne&s;s of your pre&s;ent worthy Pa&s;tor. It fills me with the &s;incere&s;t regret to leave a colleague who who has been to me a Father. No com|mendation of mine can add to his prai&s;e, which is already in the Church of Chri&s;t. Many of you, I tru&s;t, are his epi&s;tle, writ|ten in your hearts, known and read of all men. I be&s;eech you, therefore, Brethren, to know him who labours among you, and is over you in the Lord, and admo|ni&s;hes you; and to e&s;teem him very highly in love for his work's &s;ake. And be at peace among your&s;elves. And the very God of peace &s;anctify you wholly: And I pray God your whole &s;pirit, and &s;oul, and body, be pre&s;erved blamele&s;s unto the coming of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Amen.</P>
