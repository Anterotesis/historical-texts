Reign of our dread and rightful Sovereign KING GEORGE the Second; how&s;oever plea&s;ing and profitable it might be at any other time, would, at this Juncture, prove, if not an irk&s;ome, yet an un&s;ea&s;onable Undertaking.&mdash;&mdash;</P>
<P>The Occa&s;ion of the late Solemnity, I mean the Suppre&s;&s;ion of a mo&s;t horrid and <HI>unnatural Rebel|lion,</HI> will afford more than &s;ufficient Matter for a Di&s;cour&s;e of this Nature, and furni&s;h us with abundant Motives to love and obey that glori|ous <HI>Jehovah, who giveth</HI> SALVATION <HI>unto</HI> KINGS, <HI>and delivers His People from the hurtful Sword.</HI></P>
<P>Need I make an Apology, before this Audi|tory, if, in order to &s;ee the Greatne&s;s of our late Deliverance, I &s;hould remind you of the many un&s;peakable Ble&s;&s;ings which we have for a Cour&s;e of Years enjoy'd, during the Reign of His pre|&s;ent MAJESTY, and the gentle mild Admini|&s;tration under which we live?&mdash;Without ju&s;tly incurring the Cen&s;ure of <HI>giving flattering Titles</HI> I believe all who have Eyes to &s;ee, and Ears to hear, and are but a little acquainted with our publick Affairs, mu&s;t acknowledge, that we have one of the be&s;t of KINGS.&mdash;It is now above <HI>Nineteen Years</HI> &s;ince he began to reign o|ver Us&mdash;And yet, was he to be &s;eated on a Royal Throne, and were all his Subjects placed before him.

And I cannot help thinking, that it is a peculiar Ble&s;&s;ing vouch&s;afed us by the KING of KINGS, that his pre&s;ent MAJESTY has been continued &s;o long among us&mdash;For now His <HI>immediate Succe&s;&s;or</HI> (though his pre&s;ent Situa|tion obliges him, as it were, to lie <HI>dormant</HI>) has great and glorious. Opportunities, which we have Rea&s;on to think he daily improves, of ob|&s;erving and weighing the national Affairs, con|&s;idering the various Steps and Turns of Go|vernment, and con&s;equently of laying in a large Fund of Experience to make him a wi&s;e and great Prince, if ever GOD &s;hould call him to &s;way the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Sceptre&mdash;Happy art thou, O <HI>England!</HI> Happy art thou, O <HI>America,</HI> who on every &s;ide are thus highly favoured!</P>
<P>But, alas! how &s;oon would this happy Scene have &s;hifted, and a melancholly gloomy Pro&s;pect have &s;ucceeded in its room, had the Rebels gained their Point, and a Popi&s;h abjured Pretender been forced upon the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Throne!&mdash;For, &s;uppo|&s;ing his Birth not to be <HI>&s;purious,</HI> (as we have great Rea&s;on to think it really was) what could we expect from one, de&s;cended from a Fa|ther, who, when <HI>Duke of York,</HI> put all <HI>Scotland</HI> into Confu&s;ion, and afterwards, when crowned KING of <HI>England,</HI> for his Arbitrary and tyran|nical Government both in Church and State, was ju&s;tly obliged to abdicate the Throne, by the A&s;&s;ertors of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Liberty?
