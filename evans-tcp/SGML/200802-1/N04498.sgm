<HEAD>A Letter, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Rev. Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Have &s;een the Pamphlet you lately publi&s;h|ed, in Form of a Letter to me, relating to the Controver&s;y that has been between us, about what you have reported that <HI>I told you,</HI> concerning Mr. <HI>Whitefield, viz.</HI> that <Q>He told me he de&s;igned to turn the generality of Mi|ni&s;ters in the Country out of their Places, and bring over Mini&s;ters from <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and place them in their Room.</Q></P>
<P>And concerning this Letter of yours, which is your pretended An&s;wer to what I have publi&s;hed about that Matter, in An&s;wer to your printed Letter to a Friend in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> wherein you a&s;&s;erted, that I had in two private Letters to you, in Effect, in very <HI>full and &s;trong Terms</HI> own'd the whole Matter to you that you had reported; I &s;ay, concerning this Letter of yours, I would ob&s;erve, that you don't deny the Genuinene&s;s of the Copies of my Letters that I have publi&s;h'd; nor do you produce any Atte&s;tations of what you have reported of me, which you &s;ay was in a Journey to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> in <HI>May</HI> 1743: Altho' there were many Per&s;ons in Company with us in that Journey, at the Time you &s;peak of, <HI>viz.</HI> the Rev. Mr. <HI>Breck</HI> of <HI>Springfield,</HI> and the Rev. Mr. <HI>Gay</HI> of <HI>Suffield</HI> and his Wife, and Mrs. <HI>Clap</HI> your own Lady, (who, I am

confident, was not wont to be at &s;o great a Di&s;tance from you as to be out of hearing of Conver&s;ation) and your Son in Law that waited on you, and one with me on the &s;ame Hor&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> my elde&s;t Daughter, at the very Time when you &s;ay I told you this remarkable Story, who has liv'd at <HI>New-Haven</HI> all the Time of this Controver&s;y be|tween us, and mo&s;t of the Time at Mr. <HI>Noyes</HI>'s Hou&s;e, where you are very conver&s;ant, and &s;he was often in your Way; and not only &s;o, but &s;he was very conver&s;ant at your own Hou&s;e, with your Daughters; and if you had &s;een Cau&s;e to have enquired of her, would have inform|ed you, that &s;he well remember'd other Conver&s;ation that we had in that Journey, particularly the long Di&s;|pute we had about &s;ome Things you found Fault with in my Book, concerning the late Revival of Religion; but that &s;he remember'd not a Word &s;aid about Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> in that Journey. Nor did you in your Let|ter produce one Per&s;on that you have found any where, who ever heard me &s;ay any &s;uch Thing as you have re|ported, or any Thing like it at any Time; tho' I have publickly declared that I was willing all my Acquain|tance, and tho&s;e that I have been mo&s;t conver&s;ant with, Mini&s;ters or others, in this Town and el&s;ewhere, &s;hould be enquired of; and have openly challeng'd the whole World, be&s;ides you, to declare if they ever heard me report any &s;uch Thing. But all the World be&s;ides you are wholly &s;ilent: Tho' there are many Hundreds to whom it is every Way more likely I &s;hould reveal &s;uch a Secret, than to you, if I had it to reveal.</P>
<P>Nor is any Body produced in your Letter that &s;ays he heard you &s;peak of my &s;aying this to you, &s;oon after the Time you &s;ay I &s;aid it; tho' in your fir&s;t Letter you &s;ay, <HI>you took good Notice of my Words, and laid them up in your Mind, and &s;oon related them to others</HI>&punc; &s;o that by

your own Account, you was under no Re&s;traint or Dif|ficulty as to &s;peaking of this grand Secret I revealed to you. But however, it is &s;omething remarkable, that you was then in a Journey to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> and <HI>Cambridge,</HI> at that Time when you &s;ay I told you this, and was in tho&s;e Parts at the Time of the <HI>Election,</HI> and <HI>Convention</HI> of Mini&s;ters; and yet it &s;eems you was wholly &s;ilent about it then, no|thing was &s;aid or heard about it in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> or <HI>Cambridge</HI>; tho' one would think, if I had indeed declared &s;o extraor|dinary a Thing to you, it would upon every Account have been mo&s;t likely that you &s;hould &s;peak of it then, when we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e your Mind was mo&s;t affected with it, and your Heart fulle&s;t of it, having but ju&s;t received it from my Mouth; and then the Country was fuller of Talk about Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> his Coming, and the remark|able Con&s;equences of it were more recent and fre&s;h in Memory: Yet not a Word is heard of it in tho&s;e Parts that Year. But when you go to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> the Year fol|lowing, even the la&s;t Summer, more than a Twelve|month after, then you are prepared to tell the Story, and tell it abundantly, in <HI>Cambridge</HI> and <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and &s;urprize Mini&s;ters and others with the remarkable Report; and tho&s;e Parts, and the Country in general, are quickly fill'd with it. &mdash; The Title-Page of your fir&s;t printed Letter, dated la&s;t <HI>December,</HI> &s;peaks of the Report, as what you declared when in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> la&s;t, which was the la&s;t Summer; tho' the Time when we were going to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> together, when you &s;ay I told you the Story, was the Year before. And it is publick, and apparent, that the Report was new in tho&s;e Parts then; every one &s;pake of it, as well as you your&s;elf, as coming from you when you was in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> la&s;t Summer.</P>
<P>And tho' it be true, that I had a Su&s;picion of Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s aiming at People's for&s;aking unconverted Mi|ni&s;ters;
<PB N="6" REF="005582_0005_1018AFB48708B860">
and &s;o it was not wholly impo&s;&s;ible that I &s;hould mention it to you, going to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI>; and therefore I can't ab&s;olutely deny that, and have hitherto &s;train'd my Cha|rity towards you to the utmo&s;t, with Re&s;pect to that Matter (tho' as I often &s;aid before, I had no Remem|brance of it) yet the more I think of it, the more impro|bable it appears to me that I &s;hould; my Daughter, that was with me at the particular Time you fix upon, re|members nothing of it; and be&s;ides there is that in par|ticular, that makes it very unlikely that I &s;hould &s;ay any Thing to you at that Time, of &s;o much as that Su&s;pici|on, <HI>viz.</HI> That pre&s;ently after Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> went from the&s;e Parts, being in Conver&s;ation with the Rev. Mr. <HI>Hop|kins</HI> of <HI>Springfield,</HI> even the next Day after we parted with Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> at <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hopkins</HI> being my Brother-in-Law, and then appearing friendly to Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> I mention'd that Su&s;picion to him (which is the only Time that I know of that I ever mention'd it to any Body, any otherwi&s;e than on its being reported from him, I might give an Account what I &s;aid to him) I gave him &s;everal Rea&s;ons of my Su&s;picion: (But that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> had <HI>told</HI> me any &s;uch Thing, was not among the&s;e Rea&s;ons.) After this, before our foremention'd Journey to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> I heard that Mr. <HI>Hopkins</HI> had report|ed it to others, and that the Report was carried to <HI>New-Haven</HI> to you and others there, and much taken Notice of by you; which gave me no &s;mall Unea&s;ine&s;s: I was not a little concerned, that what I had thus &s;aid private|ly to my Brother <HI>Hopkins,</HI> &s;hould be thus carried abroad, and e&s;pecially that it &s;hould be handed to you. Now after this, it is not very likely that I &s;hould go, and more fully declare the &s;ame Thing to you my&s;elf; and e&s;peci|ally that I &s;hould tell you much more than that; and that, which if it was true, I clo&s;ely concealed from my
<PB N="7" REF="005582_0006_1018B01412B38960" MS="y">
Brother <HI>Hopkins.</HI> Some of the Mini&s;ters of this Coun|ty, that have lately &s;igned a Te&s;timony again&s;t Mr. <HI>White|field,</HI> had before heard Mr. <HI>Hopkins</HI> relate what I told him of my Su&s;picion, with the Rea&s;ons I gave him; and &s;ince this Controver&s;y between you and me, have declared freely that it is a convincing Argument with them, that I never told you, that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> inform'd me that he had any &s;uch De&s;ign as you mention, becau&s;e it is to them inconceivable, that I &s;hould &s;ignify my Su&s;|picion to Mr. <HI>Hopkins,</HI> and gather up the&s;e and tho&s;e Arguments to confirm it, without &s;aying any Thing to him, as if Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> had told me, that it was his De&s;ign, when it was &s;o indeed, and tho' I afterwards freely declar'd it to you.</P>
<P>And now I have mention'd this, I would pray you, <HI>Sir,</HI> &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider, whether that Report you had as coming from Mr. <HI>Hopkins,</HI> of what I told him of my Su&s;picion, was not the &s;ole Foundation, on which you in Length of Time gradually framed in your Imagina|tion the whole Story, which you afterwards reported, as being told immediately by me to you, in our Journey to <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI></P>
<P>But you, Sir, have &s;aid it, in your fir&s;t printed Letter, and you will &s;tand to it &s;till, that I have in Effect own'd the very &s;ame Thing that you have reported, <HI>in a Vari|ety of Terms that are equally full and &s;trong</HI>; yea, that you may be &s;ure not to be wanting to your&s;elf, you go fur|ther now than before, and &s;ay that <HI>my Terms are fuller and &s;tronger than yours</HI>; and are abundant in affirming it, that what I have &s;aid of MY OPINION of Mr. <HI>White|field</HI>'s aiming at People's for&s;aking unconverted Mini&s;|ters, and at converted ones being introduced, is mo&s;t plainly, and manife&s;tly, and fully the &s;ame Thing as &s;aying, that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> TOLD ME <HI>that he de&s;igned to
<PB N="8" REF="005582_0007_1018AFB7DABABA48">
turn the generality of Mini&s;ters in the Country out of their Places, and bring over Mini&s;ters from</HI> England, Scotland <HI>and</HI> Ireland, <HI>and place them in their Room</HI>; &s;o that for me to own the Former, and deny the Latter, is a mo&s;t <HI>plain, flat, amazing &s;elf-Contradiction</HI>; and repre&s;ent it (p. 7.) as an ab&s;urd Thing to make any Di&s;tinction between expre&s;&s;ing what I &s;uppo&s;ed of Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> as <HI>my Opinion,</HI> and expre&s;&s;ing it as <HI>a declared De&s;ign</HI> of Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>; and cry out, <HI>What can you mean by this Di&s;tinction?</HI> If I had only heard this of you from others, I &s;hould hardly have believed it: But if I may believe my own Eyes, I have &s;een a Gentleman of your Under&s;tanding, not in Je&s;t or only to make Sport, but gravely and &s;eriou&s;ly and in great earne&s;t, go about to &s;hew that the&s;e two Things are ex|actly the &s;ame, and to make it plain, even to a Demon|&s;tration, by rehear&s;ing over Words on both Sides, and e|laborately finding out, and cutting off Eva&s;ions, and placing the Words one again&s;t another in parallel Co|lumns, that the World might &s;ee the exact Identity; and the a&s;toni&s;hing Contradiction there is in owning one and denying the other.</P>
<P>This cannot be accounted for, any other Way, than that you was driven to great Straits. You had before reported to the World, in Print, that I, in two private Letters that I had written to you, had in Effect own'd the whole Matter that you had &s;aid concerning me: But now tho&s;e entire Letters were publi&s;hed to the World, wherein the contrary, to the highe&s;t Degree, appears to be true; that altho' therein I own it had been <HI>my Opini|on,</HI> that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> would endeavour to promote the for&s;aking unconverted Mini&s;ters, and the introducing of converted ones, yet &s;ay expre&s;ly, that I never mention|ed this as a <HI>declared De&s;ign</HI> of Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> but only <HI>my Opinion</HI>; and do in many Ways, over and over, and
<PB N="9" REF="005582_0008_1018B0166CE750C8">
in a great Variety of Expre&s;&s;ions, &s;trenuou&s;ly and &s;o|lemnly deny the whole Fact that you had reported of me. You therefore doubtle&s;s ea&s;ily &s;aw that there was nothing that you could do to ju&s;tify your&s;elf, no other Way in the World that you could take to maintain the Credit of your Uprightne&s;s and Veracity in what you had re|ported of tho&s;e private Letters, but only &s;tiffly to &s;tand to it (however ridiculou&s;ly) that for me to &s;ay that it was <HI>my Opinion</HI> that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> intended what I &s;pake of, was to all Intents and Purpo&s;es telling you, that Mr. <HI>Whitefield told me</HI> that he intended that which you have reported.</P>
<P>But dear Sir, tho' your Circum&s;tances are difficult, and your Temptations great, yet let me intreat you once to look back on what you have laid down; and after all your Po&s;itivene&s;s and high Charges, to &s;uffer in your&s;elf a little Reflection and Exerci&s;e of Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>If I had told you that it was my <HI>Opinion</HI> that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> intended to do all that which you &s;peak of, would this have been for me to tell you that Mr. <HI>White|field</HI> TOLD ME that he intended it, &s;o that you might truly from thence, in Terms, report and affirm that I &s;aid the Latter, and &s;o that it is a flat contradicting my &s;elf for me to deny &s;uch a Report? Is it exactly the &s;ame Thing for a Man to &s;ay he has &s;uch an <HI>Opinion</HI> of another's De&s;igns, as to &s;ay that that other Per&s;on <HI>told him</HI> they were his De&s;igns? And is it indeed a &s;en&s;ele&s;s Thing to make a Di&s;tinction between the&s;e two, as you &s;ignify? (p. 7.) I have been of Opinion that the Gover|nour of <HI>Canada</HI> intended to &s;end an Army to <HI>Annapolis</HI> this Year, which I may po&s;&s;ibly have told to others; may they therefore go and report in Terms, without He&s;itation, that I told them, that the Governour of <HI>Canada</HI> told me, that he did intend this? And if I hear
<PB N="10" REF="005582_0009_1018AFB95E863198">
of it afterwards, and deny that I told 'em &s;o, withal declaring what I did &s;ay, making the Di&s;tinction, am I therefore guilty of the plaine&s;t and mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing &s;elf-Contradiction, even in the very Relation I give my&s;elf, and of the greate&s;t Ab&s;urdity in making the Di&s;tinction?</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing me to be of Opinion that <HI>Rector Clap</HI> has had a De&s;ign to do his utmo&s;t to ruin my Reputation, by artfully mi&s;leading the Minds of his unwary cur&s;ory Readers, into a Belief that I have evidently perjured my &s;elf, by flatly contradicting my&s;elf upon Oath, when he him&s;elf knew in his Heart that there was no real Con|tradiction at all; I &s;ay, &s;uppo&s;ing this to be my Opini|on, I can declare it to be my Opinion with Truth: But can I therefore truly declare to others, that Mr. <HI>Clap told me</HI> that this very Thing was his De&s;ign? And if I &s;hould declare &s;o, would not you re&s;ent it, as an injuri|ous Fal&s;hood and Slander? And if I &s;hould excu&s;e my &s;elf, and &s;ay, No, I had that Opinion of you, and that was the &s;ame Thing as for me to hear you &s;ay &s;o; would you then think there was no Di&s;tinction, and that it was a &s;en&s;ele&s;s Thing to pretend any?</P>
<P>And then be&s;ides, I not only don't &s;ay in my Letters, that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> told me that he intended to do tho&s;e Things that you reported, but am far from &s;aying &s;o much as that it was my <HI>Opinion</HI> that he intended tho&s;e Things. My &s;aying, it was my Opinion that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> did aim at People's for&s;aking unconverted Mini&s;ters, and at the introducing of converted ones, is &s;urely not the &s;ame Thing as to &s;ay, it was my Opinion that Mr. <HI>Whitefield intended to turn the bigger Part of the Mini&s;ters of the Country out of their Places, and bring over Mini&s;ters from</HI> England, Scotland, <HI>and</HI> Ireland, <HI>and place them in their Room.</HI> It is my Opinion of many Per&s;ons in the World, that I know of, that they are <HI>in the Opinion and Scheme</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="005582_0010_1018B017F0D82680" MS="y">
that Popi&s;h Mini&s;ters ought not to preach, and that they would do their Endeavour, what in them lies, to have it otherwi&s;e, that Prote&s;tant Mini&s;ters &s;hould be intro|duced. But is this the &s;ame Thing as to &s;ay, that 'tis my Opinion that they intend to turn out all the Popi&s;h Mini&s;ters in the World, and introduce Prote&s;tant Mini|&s;ters into their Places, mentioning the particular Coun|tries whence they intend to bring them? My &s;aying that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> told me, he intended to bring over a Number of young Scholars into the <HI>Jer&s;eys,</HI> to be or|dained by the <HI>Tennents,</HI> don't imply that it was my Opinion that he intended to bring Mini&s;ters from tho&s;e three Countries you mention, or any Country or Countries, to &s;upply any Pulpits in <HI>New-England,</HI> or any where el&s;e, made vacant by others being turned out: Nor ever was it my Opinion: Nor did ever a Thought enter into my Heart, of Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s meaning to bring over one tenth Part enough to &s;upply the greater Part of the Pulpits in <HI>New-England</HI>; but only a few young Men, of the People called <HI>Methodi&s;ts,</HI> that were Scholars, to get Ordination.</P>
<P>But you &s;ay (p. 8 and 9.) It is an immaterial Circum|&s;tance what Countries the Mini&s;ters were to be brought from, and that it matters not whether I &s;aid one Word of Foreigners &s;upplying the Pulpits of other Mini&s;ters, or no: And therefore in&s;i&s;t upon it, that for me to &s;ay, that it was my Opinion, that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> aim'd at People's for&s;aking unconverted Mini&s;ters, and introdu|cing converted Mini&s;ters, was for me to &s;ay, that it was my Opinion Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> intended all that you have repre&s;ented; and not only this, but to &s;ay that Mr. <HI>White|field</HI> told me &s;o; in&s;omuch that to &s;ay otherwi&s;e is a flat Contradiction; and you repre&s;ent that to make any Di&s;tinction is ab&s;urd.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="005582_0011_1018AFBF118EBC58">Now <HI>Sir,</HI> if it be really &s;o, I would a&s;k, Why, in&s;tead of reporting that you heard me &s;ay that <HI>Mr.</HI> Whitefield <HI>told me</HI> that he intended to turn out the bigger Part of the Mini&s;ters in the Country <HI>&amp;c.</HI> you did not rather declare plainly and po&s;itively, at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> and <HI>Cambridge</HI> and el&s;e|where, that <HI>Mr.</HI> Whitefield <HI>told you</HI> this Story of his In|tentions? For you &s;ignify over and over in your two printed Letters, that it was your Opinion that he in|tended to turn out unconverted Mini&s;ters and introduce others, before you talked with me. And therefore by your own Account it is really true, that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> told <HI>you</HI> all that you reported as from me (at lea&s;t every Thing that was material, or worthy of any Notice in it) and you can't deny it with Truth, and without making ab&s;urd Di&s;tinctions, and &s;trange Quibbling and Equivo|cation, yea, plain and flat Self-Contradiction. Surely it would have been more to your Purpo&s;e to have declared this Thing, as one that was an Ear-Witne&s;s; without having Recour&s;e to a Report you had heard from ano|ther. Yea, and not only &s;o, but you might have pro|duced a great many Witne&s;&s;es to vouch the Truth of the &s;ame, and might have &s;aid that you heard a great many Per&s;ons &s;ay that <HI>Mr.</HI> Whitefield <HI>told them</HI> &s;o too. For you &s;peak of the generality of others that were ex|actly of the &s;ame Opinion with you and me in this Point. (Letter 1&s;t. p. 6. Letter 2d. p. 5.)</P>
<P>And there is another Difficulty that needs to be clear'd up, with Re&s;pect to your Conduct in this Matter. &mdash; When you fir&s;t appear'd in this Controver&s;y in Print you repre&s;ent the Matter as tho' you and I were well agreed in our private Letters, and &s;aid the &s;ame Thing; and &s;ignify as much as that it appear'd &s;o to you on the Receipt of my Letters, and that therefore it appear'd unaccountable to you that any Contradiction &s;hould be
<PB N="13" REF="005582_0012_1018B01973B0AA80" MS="y">
in&s;i&s;ted on between you and me (Letter 2d. at the Be|ginning) And this is almo&s;t the only Argument you have in&s;i&s;ted on in both your printed Letters, that your Report is true. And yet in the Controver&s;y, as it was managed between us in private Letters, a con&s;iderable Time before you appear'd in publick, this was never &s;o much as once mention'd, or pretended. There is no Appearance in your private Letters to me, as tho' you &s;uppo&s;ed that you and I agreed in the lea&s;t Mea&s;ure, not a Li&s;p of my unaccountably in&s;i&s;ting on a Contradiction where there was none, no Intimation of any Difficulty you found in my Letters of that Nature. Which is &s;omething &s;trange, if it was &s;o, that you did really then think that there was &s;uch an Agreement, and that I in Effect own'd all, &amp; you was then a&s;toni&s;hed at a Pretence of a Contradiction between you and me where there was none, but &s;aw &s;o great &amp; manife&s;t a Contradiction between the various Parts of my Letters, as you &s;peak of. You repre&s;ent as tho' you wrote to me in a friendly and pa|cific Manner; but then it was &s;trange you did not men|tion that which you took &s;o much Notice of, that you mu&s;t think would tend above all Things to my Con|viction. But there is not a Hint of any &s;uch Thing in your private pacific Letters (as you call 'em) either for my Conviction, or your Vindication; but when you come to appear in publick, then you are full of it, for my Re|proach, and in&s;i&s;t on &s;carce any Thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>If you deny this that I have &s;aid concerning your pri|vate Letters, I am willing you &s;hould produce them to the World, for your Vindication: And if you han't kept Copies, I promi&s;e to lend you the Originals, on your Promi&s;e that you will publi&s;h them.</P>
<P>Now Sir, I de&s;ire you to take a View of your Con|duct in this Affair, in the whole Series of it from the

Beginning. You did publickly and abundantly report that I told you, that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> told me, that he in|tended to make that fore-mention'd general Change, and great Revolution in the Country, and accompli&s;h it in that particular Manner: A Report, in a peculiar Man|ner tending to render Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> the Object of gene|ral Dete&s;tation and Abhorrence thro' the Country; (and indeed you could have no other End in it) which Report had no Foundation, becau&s;e Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> never told me any Thing of that Nature, nor did I ever tell you any &s;uch Thing: And therefore both of us were greatly injured by it.&mdash;If I had really handed this Report to you, yet for you to make &s;uch an U&s;e of it, &s;o to ruin the Re|putation of a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, and make him the Object of general Odium, would have been directly in the Face of that Rule, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.19. <HI>Again&s;t an Elder receive not an Accu&s;ation, but before two or three Witne&s;&s;es.</HI> When I under&s;tood that you had thus reported, I wrote to you in a friendly Manner, expo&s;tulating with you about it, declaring to you your Mi&s;take, and by all Means po&s;&s;ible endeavouring to convince you of it, men|tioning many Things that &s;hewed the Unrea&s;onablene&s;s of &s;uppo&s;ing it to be true. And when &s;till you did not &s;eem to be convinced, I wrote to you again more largely, mentioning all the Ways I could devi&s;e that the Mi&s;take could po&s;&s;ibly ari&s;e, hoping &s;ome Way or other to lead you to a Sen&s;e of your Mi&s;take. But you &s;till immove|ably per&s;i&s;ted in it; and not only &s;o, but in&s;tead of re|tracting, as Ju&s;tice greatly required, and I much in&s;i&s;ted in my Letters, you on the contrary, again&s;t the mo&s;t ear|ne&s;t Remon&s;trances, go on to declare it more openly than ever, even in the mid&s;t of our private Corre&s;pon|dence about it, and in a po&s;itive and peremptory Manner a&s;&s;ert it and publi&s;h it to the World from the Pre&s;s;

and not only &s;o, but tell the World that I had in Effect own'd the whole Matter to you in tho&s;e very private Letters, in which I had been repeatedly &amp; mo&s;t &s;olemnly denying it, and rea&s;oning and expo&s;tulating with you for &s;o greatly injuring Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> and me in the Report, and in&s;i&s;ting that you &s;hould retract it; and which Let|ters were written for that very End, and of which it was the whole Drift, as you was very &s;en&s;ible, as appears by your An&s;wers written to me, never once pretending to me in tho&s;e Letters, that I own'd it, or agreed with you (as you tell the World) or &s;aid any Thing looking that Way, but all along going wholly upon the Suppo&s;ition that I denied it only. When it came to this, I had no other Way left for me to take, tho' it was very contrary to my Inclination, but to go into the Pre&s;s too, and from thence declare the Matter as it was, and publi&s;h tho&s;e very Let|ters of mine, and endeavour to convince the World that you had greatly abu&s;ed Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> and me. Upon this you go on &s;till, and re&s;olutely per&s;i&s;t in what you &s;aid before; and becau&s;e I &s;ay that I once was of <HI>Opinion</HI> that Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> endeavour'd to promote People's for&s;aking unconverted Mini&s;ters, and the introducing of others, but deny that ever <HI>he told me</HI> what you have re|ported, or that he ever hinted to me any Thing like it, You charge me before the World with the mo&s;t plain, flat, amazing, a&s;toni&s;hing, unaccountable Self-Contra|diction, and &s;trange and &s;olemn Quibbling and Equivo|cating to amu&s;e and deceive the World; and intimate that I have been guilty of Je&s;uitical Management in a &s;olemn Oath (p. 6.) And then when you have done all this, you fini&s;h with complaining that I have treated you with very <HI>unhand&s;ome</HI> and <HI>unchri&s;tian</HI> Reflections; yet &s;ay you won't <HI>render Evil for Evil, or Railing for Rail|ing</HI>;

but that you <HI>are &s;o far from it, that you will forgive me without my a&s;king it.</HI></P>
<P>Here I forbear to add any Reflections; I tru&s;t that your own Con&s;cience will be full of tho&s;e that are pro|per when you have read this: And if you don't &s;uitably reflect ju&s;t now, yet I hope the Time will come when you will be &s;edate, and will with Solemnity of Spirit think of the&s;e Things, and be enabled to look on your own Conduct with real Seriou&s;ne&s;s, as in the Sight of God.
