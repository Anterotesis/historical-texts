<P>IT was a &s;ad and awful Expo&s;tulation ut|tered by the holy Prophet, in Jer. 14.19 <HI>Ha&s;t thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy Soul loathed Zion? Why ha&s;t thou &s;mitten us and there is no healing for us? We looked for Peace and there is no good; and for the time of healing, and behold trouble</HI>; Hence the &s;ame Prophet gives vent to his pent up grief, by &s;aying, <HI>When I would comfort my &s;elf again&s;t &s;orrow, my heart is faint in me; the Harve&s;t is pa&s;t, the Summer is end|ed, and we are not healed; for the hurt of the Daugh|ter of my People, I am hurt, I am black, A&s;toni&s;ment hath taken hold upon me: Is there no Balm in Gilead? Is there no Phy&s;ician there?</HI> Jer. 8.18, 20, 21, 22. Our Text pre&s;ents a rich and royal Cordial that may revive the drooping Spirits of God's Children when his back&s;lidden People among whom they live, are by their own Sins, &amp; God's judgments

'Tis the hold which Chri&s;t the Phy&s;ician has of this Patient; and the rooting which he has in Chri&s;t, by which he is confir|med and led.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Effect of it, is comfort to him and to his Mourners. It implys the removal of the angui&s;h and &s;orrow following Sin; and the con|ferring comfort and con&s;olation upon them and
<PB N="5" REF="001529_0007_0FB39D50B4840FB0">
their Mourners; that is, &s;uch as Mourn over the &s;in, rebellion and ob&s;tinacy of this froward Peo+ple, and &s;ympathize with them in their deep di&s;tre&s;s. God has &s;ome Mourners in the wor&s;t of times, that are faithful with God, Ezek. 9.4, 6. The&s;e God will take care of in time of general judgment, to comfort the&s;e Mourners; to ap|point unto them that Mourn in Zion, <HI>to give unto them beauty for a&s;hes, the oyl of Joy for Mour|ning, the garment of prai&s;e for the &s;pirit of heavine&s;s, that they might be called trees of righteou&s;ne&s;s the Plan|ting of the Lord, that he may be glorifyed,</HI> I&s;ai. 61.2, 3.</P>
<P>The DOCTRINE from the words is this.</P>
<P><HI>DOCT.</HI> When God has a de&s;ign of Love to a Per&s;on or Province, He will Ob&s;erve their Wayes in order to their healing, He will lead them al&s;o, and re&s;tore Comforts to them and to their Mourners.</P>
<P>When there is a Patient dangerou&s;ly Sick, un|der a purpo&s;e of Gods Love, God Him&s;elf will be his Phy&s;ician. Thus it was with I&s;rael in Je|remiah's time, when God &s;aid to her why crye&s;t thou for thine affliction? thy &s;orrow is incura|ble, for the multitude of thine iniquity: becau&s;e thy &s;ins were increa&s;ed, I have done the&s;e things unto thee. I will re&s;tore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, faith the Lord, becau&s;e they call thee an out-ca&s;t, &s;aying, This is Zion, whom no man &s;eeketh after&punc; As if God

had &s;aid, true indeed your ca&s;e is in it &s;elf de|&s;perate, but for this cau&s;e I will undertake thy Cure, I have a remedy for the wor&s;t of thy Ma|ladies; Here we have God's Cure of <HI>Zion,</HI> when incurably Wounded; Now God will apply a <HI>Sanative Catapla&s;m,</HI> a Healing Plai&s;ter: This is Repentance, and Re&s;titution, <HI>Jer.</HI> 30.15, 17. [Thus Excellent Mr. Norton di&s;cants upon the&s;e words in his Election Sermon.] So, I&s;ai. 43.25. <HI>I even I am he that bloteth out thy tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions for my own &s;ake, and will not remember thy &s;ins.</HI> To whom is this promi&s;e made? See 22, 23. <HI>ver&s;es.</HI> They were &s;uch as had either neglected or cor|rupted the Service of God and Divine Wor&s;hip, and were refractory in it; yet God brings in this promi&s;e, I that am thus &s;lighted, thus pro|voked, <HI>Will blot out your iniquities,</HI> I&s;ai. 30.17, 18.</P>
<P>For the clearing up of the Doctrine, take two Propo&s;itions.</P>
<P>PROP. I. <HI>GOD &s;ees and ob&s;erves the ways of his profe&s;&s;ing Declining People to whom He has a de&s;ign of Love.</HI></P>
<P>Take two Po&s;itions here.</P>
<P>Po&s;. 1. <HI>The wayes of a People are either Internal or External.</HI> The Internal ways of a People are the ways of their heart, as in our Context, I&s;a. 57.I7, <HI>He went on frowardly in the way of his heart.</HI> And the&s;e ways of the heart, their inward ways, are, their Thoughts, what they imagine and con|ceive: Their Affections, what they love, and
<PB N="7" REF="001529_0009_0FB39D5479ADCAF8">
what they hate, what they rejoyce in, and what they Mourn for, declare the way of their heart. The ways of their heart are their purpo&s;es, re&s;o|lutions, and intentions what to do. Yea, the ways of their heart are their de&s;igns or aims, what they drive at, or propo&s;e as their end in all that they do. The&s;e Internal ways of a People are &s;een &amp; ob&s;erved by God: Joh. 2.25. <HI>He needed not that any &s;hould te&s;tify of man; for he knew what was in man.</HI> And God &s;ees and ob&s;erves the Ex|ternal ways of a People. Yea if we take the ways of a People as differenced in their kinds, as they are either good or evil; the Eyes of the Lord are upon both. <HI>They are</HI> (&s;aith Solomon Prov. 15.3.) <HI>in every place, beholding the evil and the good.</HI> Hence what ever is done in the World, falls under the notice and cognizance of God, He that looketh to the ends of the earth, and &s;eeth under the whole heaven, cannot but take notice of all that is done, or comes to pa&s;s all the world over, <HI>Job</HI> 28.24. The Lord beholds all things di&s;tinctly; not in gro&s;s only or in a lump; He beholds the lea&s;t as well as the greate&s;t; He looks upon every parcel, and opens the whole pack and bundle of humane affairs; Per&s;onal, Dome&s;tick, Civil, Sacred, Military. He beholds every thing, and Per&s;on, People and Province perfectly, fully, quite through; He that is All Eye &s;eeth all at once, all as one. Acts 15.18. <HI>Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.</HI> He is Omni&s;cient, and Omnipre&s;ent, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 139.

1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, I0, 11, 12. <HI>This Thought</HI> &s;hould repre&s;s all tumultuatings of Spirit in Gods Children in the greate&s;t Worldly tumults and vici&s;&s;itudes, P&s;al 46.10. <HI>Be &s;till and know that I am God.</HI> Men are not GOD, they cannot &s;ee what to do; nor do what they &s;ee. But I who am GOD can &s;ee under the whole heaven what is doing, and what to do; and I can do what&s;oever I &s;ee needful to be done. Therefore be &s;till, be not ye hurried either with <HI>di&s;contents</HI> at what is do|ing, nor with <HI>fear</HI> of what may be done; for, know I am GOD, I look to the ends of the earth, and what I &s;ay <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be done; and what is <HI>ju&s;t</HI> for all men, and <HI>be&s;t</HI> for you who are my Peo|ple, &s;hall be done. Here's the true ground of courage, and of quietne&s;s: P&s;al. 46.1, 2 <HI>God is our refuge and &s;trength, a very pre&s;ent help in trou|ble, therefore will not we fear, though the earth be moved,</HI> &amp;c, They that fear God, have no rea&s;on either to be <HI>afraid,</HI> or to be <HI>di&s;contended.</HI> He, that looks to the ends of the earth and &s;ees their wayes, and the ways of all the Children of men; is their Friend and their Father; therefore he will look to them, and &s;ee that all &s;hall go well with them, or end well for them.</P>
<P><HI>Po&s; 2.</HI> Here God's &s;eeing and observing the Ways this Pro&s;e&s;&s;ing declining People to whom he has a de|sign of love; implyes the perfect knowledge which this Al&s;ufficient Phy&s;ician has of the Nature and Ma|lignity of the Di&s;temper, which Threatens ruine to the Sick Patient</P>

Why is this People of Jeru&s;alem &s;lidden back by a <HI>conquering,</HI> or <HI>prevailing</HI> back &s;liding?

<P>Here take three Po&s;itions, for the clearing up of this Propo&s;ition.</P>
<P N="1">1. Po&s;ition is, <HI>That now at this Critical juncture when the di&s;ea&s;e is &s;o near it's Cri&s;is, This Al&s;ufficient Phy&s;ician undertakes the Cure, and Re&s;olves to Heal by the bright di&s;play of Soveraign Grace and Rich Mercy.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Be the di&s;ea&s;e what it will, whether a di&s;temper upon the Soul, or upon the body, up|on a Per&s;on or Province; This Phy&s;ician can make an agreeable application to them for their Healing: 1 King. 8.37, 38, 39. <HI>If there be in the Land Famine, if there be Pe&s;tilence, bla&s;ting, mildew, locust, or if there be caterpillar, if their enemy be&s;iege them in the Land of their Cities, what&s;oever Plague, what&s;oever Sickne&s;s there be</HI>: The Expre&s;&s;ion is Ex|ceeding full and comprehen&s;ive, &s;o that no Per|&s;on nor People have room left to &s;ay, there is no mention of my ca&s;e, condition or mi&s;ery; God comprehends them all in this expre&s;&s;ion, (<HI>What|ever Plague or Sickne&s;s it is</HI>) whether more Imme|diately
<PB N="15" REF="001529_0017_0FB39D6471CF4C08">
from Gods hand, or more mediately by Second cau&s;es, inward or outward Sickne&s;s, this Phy&s;ician can work a thorow cure Our dear Lord Chri&s;t when here, healed all manner of Sick|ne&s;s, &amp; all manner of di&s;ea&s;e among the People, <HI>Mat.</HI> 4.23 &amp; 9.35. And he is now as able and willing to heal and help, as when he was here up|on Earth. Hence it is neither the Greatne&s;s of the Sickne&s;s and Sin, nor the want of a Remedy, or a Skilful Compa&s;&s;ionate Phy&s;ician, that kills the Patient: but it is his not Accepting of Healing Medicine; His not &s;tooping to the Remedy, his non-compliance with this Phy&s;ician in the me|thod he pre&s;cribes to him for his cure.</P>
<P N="2">2. He Heals by the bright di&s;play of Sove|raign Grace and Rich Mercy. This Grace of God is God able and willing freely to di&s;po&s;e of Spiritual good unto his Creature, tho' un|worthy and de&s;erving ill from him. And this Mercy of God, is God Able and Willing to Suc|cour the Creature in Mi&s;ery. Now this Grace and Mercy may be con&s;idered either as it is in God, and &s;o re&s;pects his Divine Sufficiency: Or, as it flows from God, and &s;o re&s;pects his Divine Efficiency: Hence it may be con&s;idered either in the Degree and Purpo&s;e to give Grace and &s;hew Mercy, which is Increated Grace &amp; Mercy: Or in the actual accompli&s;hment and execution of that decree by Providence; which is created Grace and Mercy, and is the actual Accompli&s;h|ment of his purpo&s;e by his Providence.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="001529_0018_0FB39D65B23228A0">Now as Mi&s;ery is the Object of Mercy, &s;o Un|worthine&s;s is the Object of Grace; Hence this Mi&s;erable and Unworthy Patient is an Agreea|ble Object for the Great God to di&s;play his So|veraign Grace &amp; rich Mercy upon, and toward in healing of him <HI>then</HI> when the ca&s;e &s;eems to be de&s;perate: He needs common and &s;pecial Mercy to be extended to him in his deep mi&s;e|ry; Common Mercy manife&s;ts it &s;elf, either in Creation or Providence: Common Mercy ma|naged by Divine Efficiency di&s;playing it &s;elf in Providence, is Gods Actual communication of Mercy unto, and providing &s;uitable Mercy for his Creatures according to their various nece&s;&s;i|ties: And this &s;hews it &s;elf in Con&s;ervation, and Gubernation; and this mi&s;erable Patient needs Mercy in each of the&s;e re&s;pects. <HI>Di&s;cimus hinc, &s;alutis no&s;trae initium e&s;&s;e mi&s;ericordiam Dei,</HI> faith a good Divine. Yea he needs &s;pecial Mercy to &s;hew it &s;elf in the great works of Redemption, and the Application of Redemption unto him, whereby he may be fitted for full and compleat Glorification.</P>
<P>Hence the Effectual Application of Redemp|tion in Saving Conver&s;ion is &s;tiled an act of Mercy and Divine Commi&s;eration. 1 Pet. 2.9, 10. <HI>Ye are a cho&s;en Generation, a royal Prie&s;t-hood, an holy Nation, a peculiar People; that ye &s;hould &s;hew forth the Prai&s;es of him, who hath called you out of darkne&s;s into his marvellous light: which in time pa&s;t were not a People, but are now the People of God: which had
<PB N="17" REF="001529_0019_0FB39D6A081DBE58">
not obtained Mercy, but now have obtained Mercy.</HI> The Elect are called (and by Effectual Calling &s;o made) <HI>ve&s;&s;els of Mercy,</HI> Rom. 9.2. So <HI>Ju&s;ti|fication, Adoption, Sanctification,</HI> and in the end <HI>Glo|rification,</HI> are fruits and effects of &s;pecial Mercy. And this Patient &s;tands in need of all this Mercy.</P>
<P>Moreover, This Unworthy Patient &s;tands in need of the bright and &s;hining di&s;play of Sove|raign Grace, not only to bring him <HI>into,</HI> but to <HI>continue</HI> him in the favour of God. Our Divines truly &s;ay, That God in the work of Regenera|tion has in&s;tamped upon the Regenerate the work of his Grace which indureth for ever; ac|cording to what is written in, 1 Joh. 3.9. <HI>Who&s;o|ever is born of God, doth not commit &s;in; for his Seed remaineth in him.</HI> 1 Pet. 1.23. <HI>Being born again not of corruptible Seed but of Incorruptible, by the word of God which liveth and abideth for ever</HI>: Yet notwith&s;tanding this Principle of Grace, if God withdraw his A&s;&s;istance, it would all come to nothing; and therefore there is need of this Grace of God; according as it is graciou&s;ly pro|mi&s;ed in Jer. 32.40. <HI>I will make an everla&s;ting Co|venant with them, that I will not turn away from them to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they &s;hall not depart from me.</HI></P>
<P>Yea he needs the Grace of God to continue him under the Actual influences of the favour of God: Gods own Children may be Children <HI>under Wrath,</HI> tho' not Children <HI>of Wrath</HI>; it mu&s;t
<PB N="18" REF="001529_0020_0FB39D6BDCCAF8C0">
be the Grace of God that can keep them in the Actual favour of God.</P>
<P>In a word, he needs the Grace of God to re|cover him from his falls, and to keep him from falling, <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.18, 19. As it is the Lord that giveth Repentance at the fir&s;t, &s;o it is God that mu&s;t give Repentance afterward. Acts 5.31. <HI>Him hath God exalted with his Right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give Repentance to I&s;rael, and forgivene&s;s of Sins.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. This Almighty Phy&s;ician undertakes the Cure <HI>Now</HI> at this Critical juncture, when the Di&s;ea&s;e is &s;o near its Cri&s;is, That He may make the more bright and &s;hining di&s;play of his own Glory. The glory of the Phy&s;ician, and the more of his skill appears when the Ca&s;e is thus de&s;perate; His Wi&s;dom, His Grace, His Mercy Appears the more &s;ignal in his looking after &s;uch an one, as had no will to look after Him; Al|tho' he was ga&s;ping for life, and mu&s;t inevitably Dy unle&s;s this compa&s;&s;ionate Phy&s;ician &s;peedily &s;teps in to his help. And truly, when we are ca&s;t in Common Law, what have we to hope in but Prerogative Mercy? When good men in all Orders find all attempts to recover a Back&s;lid|den People awfully to be fru&s;trated, needs mu&s;t they &s;ink in de&s;pondency, and lo&s;e their Faith and Hope, did they not encourage them by this con&s;ideration, that as God can, &s;o <HI>He</HI> frequently doth, take &s;uch an Opportunity to make him|&s;elf known; and &s;o have the whole Glory of
<PB N="19" REF="001529_0021_0FB39D6D40C75740">
&s;uch a Peoples Salvation a&s;cribed to him. P&s;al. 106.8. <HI>Neverthele&s;s, He Saved them for his Name &s;ake: that he might make his mighty Power to be known.</HI></P>
<P>Yea this Almighty Phy&s;ician undertakes the Cure <HI>Now</HI> at this Critical juncture, when the Di&s;ea&s;e is &s;o de&s;perate, to humble the Patient. O how will this humble the Patient and magni|fy the Phy&s;ician, when he mu&s;t acknowledge his Di&s;temper to be &s;o immedical that it had not been cured, had not God done it; <HI>He it was that brought me up out of an horrible put, out of the miry clay, and &s;et my feet upon a rock, and e&s;tabli&s;hed my going,</HI> P&s;al. 40.2. He mu&s;t own that it is of the Lords Mercy that he is not con&s;umed, it is be|cau&s;e his compa&s;&s;ions fail not, <HI>They are new every Morning: great is his faithfulne&s;s,</HI> Lam. 3.22, 23.</P>
<P N="4">4. I proceed to &s;how the way of Gods Cure of this &s;ick Patient, be it Per&s;on or Province; and the u&s;ual Method which God takes for his Healing (tho' we may not limit him who is the Ab&s;olute Soveraign of Heaven and Earth, and Heals when he plea&s;eth, whom He plea&s;eth, and in what way He plea&s;eth) yet Gods Ordinary way of working lyes here.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) God di&s;covers to them the evil of their own wayes; He makes them feel the &s;mart, and be &s;en&s;ible of the danger of their own &s;ickne&s;s, I <HI>King.</HI> 8.38. They &s;ee and know the Plague of their own heart. God di&s;covers to them the
<PB N="20" REF="001529_0022_0FB39D6EC4AEEDC8">
Malignity and Danger of their Di&s;ea&s;e; it is a Plague and that in the heart; and will prove mo&s;t deadly, if not prevented and healed. Rom. 6 23. <HI>The wages of &s;in is death.</HI> God will make them to &s;ee them&s;elves perishing, and dying Eternally, except the LORD under|take for them. God makes them true Evange|lical Mourners, he breaks their hearts for, and effectually off from &s;in, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 57.15, 16.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) God makes them to &s;ee their own ina|bility to heal them&s;elves, and that no created Phy&s;ician can cure them. This di&s;ea&s;e blinds the Under&s;tanding, makes the Will rebellious, wounds the Con&s;cience, di&s;orders the Affecti|ons, di&s;tempers the whole man; &s;o that they have no power to help them&s;elves; They are bed-rid Creatures, not able to &s;tir or look out for a Cure; They know not the way of Peace; They have dexterity to de&s;troy them&s;elves, not to help them&s;elves; They can neither find out a remedy, nor Apply the remedy when it is found out, <HI>Prov.</HI> 30.2.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) In order to the healing of this Patient (be it Per&s;on or Province) God di&s;covers the excellency of the remedy which He has provi|ded for their recovery. He has laid help upon One that is Mighty, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 89.19. He has <HI>&s;o loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that who&s;oever believeth in him &s;hould not peri&s;h but have eternal life,</HI> Joh. 3.16. There is no want of Skill or Will in this good and great Phy&s;ician.
<PB N="21" REF="001529_0023_0FB39D7041EE6E38">
Heb. 7.25. <HI>He is able to &s;ave them to the uttermo&s;t that come unto God by him, &s;eeing he ever liveth to make interce&s;&s;ion for them.</HI> He is able to Save un|to the utmo&s;t <GAP DESC="foreign"> the phra&s;e may de|note three thing&s;, The perpetuity, the perfection of the Salvation which he worketh, or el&s;e the perfection of his influence or cau&s;ality in the working of it.

He is not a Tem|poral but an Eternal Saviour, He is able to Save unto all Eternity. [2] It may import the Ab|&s;olute perfection and fulne&s;s of the Salvation which he worketh.

<P>Here con&s;ider two things,</P>
<P N="1">1. That there is no want of <HI>Skill</HI> in this good and great Phy&s;ician : He is cloathed with a Di|vine Ability and Mediatorial Sufficiency to work a thorow Care upon tho&s;e that by Faith repair to Him for healing: He is the true <HI>Immanuel,</HI> the Word made fle&s;h, the Man Gods Fellow, a

Royal Prie&s;t, a Prie&s;tly Prophet, and a Prophe|tical King all in One.</P>
<P N="1">(1) That there is no want or Skill in this good and great Phy&s;ician appears, in that He is true God and true Man in One Per&s;on. He is very God, not a Metaphorical, but the True God, 1 <HI>Job.</HI> 5.20. Not a God by <HI>Office,</HI> but a God by <HI>Nature, Jer.</HI> 23 6. This is his Name where|by he &s;hall be called, <HI>JEHOVAH t&s;idkenu, The LORD our Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Tho' not Son of Him|&s;elf <GAP DESC="foreign"> as to his Sub&s;tance, yet God of Him|&s;elf <GAP DESC="foreign"> as to his E&s;&s;ence: Gods Name is in him, <HI>Exod</HI> 23 21.

Certainly his Omnipatency is the be&s;t <HI>Salve</HI> for the Creatures Impotency; His <HI>All</HI> for our nothingne&s;s.</P>
<P>Yea that there is no want of skill in this Phy|&s;ician appears, in that He is &s;o nearly joyned un|to us; He that is able and &s;ufficient to work Salvation for us mu&s;t be a Per&s;on conjunct with us, and &s;o was Chri&s;t; He was our Goel, our next Kin&s;man by his Incarnation, and our Re|deemer by his Pa&s;&s;ion; He a&s;&s;umed our Nature into Him&s;elf, that he might Redeem us. <HI>Job.</HI> 1.14. <HI>The WORD was made Fle&s;h.</HI> All other Creations are (as it were) <HI>extra Deum,</HI> but here was a Creation in the very Per&s;on of God.

where the knot was tyed, was the Virgins Womb: There was He made of a Woman, Con|&s;ub&s;tantial with us, as to his Humanity; who was Con&s;ub&s;tantial with the Father, as to his Divinity.</P>
<P N="2">(2) That there is no want of skill in this good and great Phy&s;ician appears, in that he has in Him&s;elf a fulne&s;s of All Increated and Created Wi&s;dom and Skill. Col. 1.19. <HI>It plea&s;ed the Fa|ther that in him all fulne&s;s &s;hould dwell.</HI> God is only Wi&s;e and Skilful, becau&s;e all Wi&s;dom and Skill is from Him, as He hath Wi&s;dom and Skill of and from Him&s;elf, &s;o all others have Wi&s;dom and Skill from Him, it is, but a drop from this Ocean: Wi&s;dom and Skill is either Created or Increated; Created Wi&s;dom and Skill is from God whether it be Theological, Civil or Phy|&s;ical. Dan. 2.21. <HI>God giveth Wi&s;dom to the wi&s;e, and knowledge to them that know under&s;tanding.</HI> Hence Chri&s;t our Phy&s;ician hath skill enough to cure and heal the greate&s;t Maladies, the mo&s;t incurable Di&s;ea&s;es; whether they be Soul|di&s;tempers or bodily di&s;tre&s;&s;es; whether they be Political or Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Wounds and Sick|ne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P N="2">2. Con&s;ider, That there is no want of <HI>Will</HI> in this good &amp; great Phy&s;ician to Heal all tho&s;e given to Him by the Father, in the Covenant of Redemption: Hence,</P>
<P N="1">(1) Chri&s;t did not only cloath Him&s;elf with Humanity, but became their Spon&s;or or Surety,

and &s;o in Law One Per&s;on with them, whom the Father had given to Him in the Covenant of Redemption, That He might be their Healer and Phy&s;ician. He doth not only plead their cau&s;e, but pay their Debts: Chri&s;t entred into Bond for them, and took all their Debts and Duties what&s;oever they owe to God, upon him|&s;elf, to &s;ee all performed; that they might go free and be accepted, <HI>Heb.</HI> 7.22. Hence Chri&s;t did undertake as in their Nature, &s;o in their Name, and did re&s;tipulate with God on their behalf, That what&s;oever was owing to his Ju&s;tice and Holine&s;s by them, either as a penalty for pa&s;t defaults, or a duty to pre&s;ent Commands, &s;hould all be &s;atisfyed and performed by him|&s;elf, i'le lay down my life, I'le pour out my Soul, (<HI>&s;aith Chri&s;t</HI>) let all the wrath due to them be &s;queezed into one Cup, and I'le drink it up to the bottom: Let the fire of Gods anger drop down from Heaven, and I'le be the <HI>Pa&s;chal Lamb</HI> roa&s;ted in it; Thus willing was this great and gracious Phy&s;ician to Heal this Peri&s;hing Patient, <HI>That He Dy's that the Patient might live</HI>: Thus our Lord Chri&s;t this Compa&s;&s;ionate Phy|&s;ician was &s;o Willing to <HI>Heal</HI> and <HI>Help</HI> the Pa|tient, That He becomes his Surety and was One with Him in Nature, that He might be One with Him in Law too.</P>
<P>Yea his Willingne&s;s to heal and help, is Evi|denced by what He has done and &s;uffered, to purcha&s;e and procure their healing; He has

by his Obedience unto Death &s;atisfyed Divine Ju&s;tice to the full; His Obedience was a fair Commentary on the whole Law, written in glorious Characters of Holine&s;s and Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s all his life long, and at his Death Sealed up and Cla&s;ped with his precious blood. <HI>He was</HI> (&s;aith a Worthy Divine) <HI>as it were in pangs of forward Obedience to be Baptized in his own blood, and po&s;ted on towards an Agony of Wrath in an Agony of Love</HI>: and when he Arrived at his extreame&s;t Sufferings, His Signal Willingne&s;s turned his Suffering into Doing, and his Cro&s;s into a Tri|umphant Chariot; He Triumphed in it, &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, <HI>Col.</HI> 2.15.

<P>Rulers bind the People that are under them, to Order: They bind them by their Laws: Laws are bonds, they have a binding Power, they bind either to Obedience or to Puni&s;h|ment: And therefore Rulers are binders, they bind the Unruly and di&s;obedient; They bind with the Rule of the Law, and with the Penal|ties of the Law: When any break the Rule of the Law, then they fall under the Penalties of the Law; &s;o that every way a Ruler is a Binder; and as He is a Binder, &s;o a Healer: The Laws of Government by which People are bound, are for their healing: for the healing of their manners and corruptions; As al&s;o, for the healing of tho&s;e whom they have oppre&s;&s;ed or wounded by their Evil Manners and Corruptions, LAWS are the Security of a Peo|ple,

Oh! what need then have we to do our Utmo&s;t for the Healing and Curing of the <HI>Heart-Plagues,</HI> and <HI>Spiritual Maladies</HI> of our <HI>Sick Churches</HI> and <HI>Con|gregations,</HI> That &s;o no Precious and Immortal SOUL may finally be lo&s;t thro' our default; but that we may be free from the guilt of the bloud of Souls, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 3.17, 18, 19, 20, 21. It is therefore our duty to Inculcate upon them their Malady, and to di&s;cover to them the Remedy. Oh! what need have we to take heed to our &s;elves, and to the re&s;pective Flocks committed to us by the Holy Gho&s;t, to feed them, and to give

All Chri&s;tians mu&s;t labour after this, but e&s;pecially Mini&s;ters: There will be no di&s;|charge of our work as Chri&s;tians, or as Mini&s;ters without the Inhabitation, and Saving operation of the Spirit: We &s;hould therefore Earne&s;tly Pray, that we may be &s;o filled with the Spirit, as that we may have &s;o much of the Grace and gracious operation of the Spirit in us, as to inable us from an inward abiding Principle; To be|lieve all My&s;teries Revealed, Imbrace all Pro|mi&s;es, Di&s;pence all Ordinances, Obey all Com|mands, Improve with humble Submi&s;&s;ion to Gods di&s;po&s;ing, all Providences to their end&punc; Yea we &s;hould Pray that we may be filled in the highe&s;t mea&s;ure with the Spirit, to the mea&s;ure of the fulne&s;s of the &s;tatute of Chri&s;t, <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.13.
