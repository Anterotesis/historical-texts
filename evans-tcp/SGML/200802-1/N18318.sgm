<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I AM glad to &s;ee you my Si&s;ter, hop|ing our Di&s;cour&s;e may be for edifi|cation; and I de&s;ire to know whether you are well in body, but more e&s;pecially whether your &s;oul is in health and pro&s;perity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARTHA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I perceive, Si&s;ter, your enquiry after my health requires a more deep and &s;olemn an&s;wer than is common at the meeting of friends, who u&s;ually enquire only after the welfare of the mortal body, as tho' that was a matter of the greate&s;t importance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly it is &s;o: But why are we not more concerned for the immortal &s;oul than the mortal bo|dy of our friend? Is it not becau&s;e we are apt to look more at things that are &s;een, which are temporal, than at the things that are not &s;een, which are eter|nal? Could the clouds be removed, and the veil drawn a&s;ide that hides eternity from our &s;ight, I be|lieve we &s;hould often be apt to forget to enquire whether this mortal body was healthy, and our fir&s;t and la&s;t di&s;cour&s;e when we met together would be concerning our &s;oul's health, and that eternal life that &s;hall never end. But you have not yet told me whether you are well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can an&s;wer concerning my body; thro' the mercy of GOD I am well. But when I think of my &s;oul I hardly know what to &s;ay concerning that; but I cannot &s;ay it is in health, for it is almo&s;t &s;urfeit|ed with the cares of this pre&s;ent life, which makes me feel unfit for the &s;ervice of GOD or man. I long to have it otherways, but I cannot obtain my de&s;ire: If you can tell me of any way to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ee <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> this care and trouble, I &s;hould be gl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> to hear it.</P>

I &s;ay come &s;it and hear &s;uch comforting words as the&s;e, and &s;ee what will become of all your care and trouble.</P>

<SPEAKER>MARTHA.</SPEAKER>
<P>O how happy I &s;hould be if I had nothing to do but to &s;it at JESUS' feet and hear his words; but there is &s;o much nece&s;&s;ary &s;ervice for me to do in the affairs of this world, that it not only takes up my time, but takes up my mind al&s;o too much, and cau&s;es many troubles: So that I am &s;ometimes ready to wi&s;h that I had wings <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a dove, that I might fly away and be at re&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARY.</SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;eem to think you &s;hould be happy if you had nothing to do but to &s;it at JESUS' feet and hear his words, but I can tell you we &s;hould always be at the feet of JESUS, let our work be what it will. Our trouble does not con&s;i&s;t in what we have to do or &s;uffer; but &s;in is the cau&s;e of all our trouble. We may be as truly at the feet of CHRIST, and take as much plea&s;ure when we are doing his will, as when we have nothing to do but to &s;it and hear his words. It is plea&s;ant to know what our LORD commands us to do, but much of our happine&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in doing his will. Therefore you are unwi&s;e to wi&s;h for wings to fly away to find re&s;t; for true re&s;t is only to be found in the place where our wi&s;e LORD &s;ees fit to put us: There is the be&s;t place in all the world for us to take de|light, if we can but ca&s;t our trouble&s;ome &s;ins away.</P>

<P>Ca&s;t all your care upon the LORD, for he careth for you; and let your care be to do your duty every day: Let your m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nd be &s;tayed on him, and he will keep you in perfect peace. We bring need|le&s;s trouble upon our&s;elves, by trying to do the work that the LORD hath told us he will do him&s;elf. It is the LORD's work to take care of his children. Our kind Father knows his poor children are not fit to ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ve for them&s;elves and therefore he hath revealed it to be his will that they &s;hould tru&s;t them&s;elves and all their concerns wholly in his faithful hands. He knows what we have need of&punc; and our GOD will &s;upply all our need. He will give grace and glory, and no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly: Then our care &s;hould be to &s;ee that we walk uprightly.</P>

<P>But what &s;hall I do when my heaven|ly Father &s;eems to frown upon me, and Providence works &s;o that it looks as if all was again&s;t me?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then tru&s;t in the LORD and &s;tay upon your GOD; tho' he &s;lay you, yet &s;ay you will tru&s;t in him. If you are in trouble, call on the LORD for help&punc; but never let a murmuring tho't have any &s;tay in your &s;oul. How unrea&s;onable it is for poor, dark, &s;hort-&s;ighted mortals to think they could order any matter more wi&s;ely than it is ordered by Him who is infinitely wi&s;e of heart and mighty in power. Though Providence may look ever &s;o dark to you, yet as certain as you can be that you love GOD, &s;o certain you may be that all things are working to|gether for your good. I think this word in <HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 28. is worthy of a moments meditation. <HI>"And we know"</HI> Here is &s;omething it &s;eems the Saints have a &s;ure knowledge of, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">et things look ever &s;o dark; though they may be de&s;titute,

afflicted and tormented ever &s;o much, yet they may &s;ay, We know <HI>"that all things;"</HI> (this is a very comprehen&s;ive word, it takes in all the mercies and afflictions the Saints can meet with in time) <HI>"work together for good to them that love</HI> GOD."&mdash;As a &s;kilful Phy&s;ician would ap|ply many medicines to a man afflicted with many &s;ore di&s;ea&s;es, &s;ome of the medicines might be &s;weet and &s;ome bitter, telling him, all &s;hall work to|gether for good: So our dear Redeemer deals with us in wi&s;dom and love. He cau&s;ed us to hear his &s;weet voice, which brought us to life when we were dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins; yet we are &s;till afflicted with many &s;ore di&s;ea&s;es, all which he has undertook to cure. And there ne|ver was or will be a Phy&s;ician on earth worthy to be compared with him: He is infinite in know|ledge, and of never-failing &s;kill. Then let us re&s;t our&s;elves &s;afely in his hands, and be exceed|ing joyful in all our tribulations, nothing doubt|ing but that the bittere&s;t pill will do the mo&s;t good. I find I cannot expre&s;s clearly what I &s;ee of the&s;e things; but I hope you under&s;tand my mind by my weak expre&s;&s;ions.</P>

<SPEAKER>MARTHA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe I under&s;tand your mean|ing, though your expre&s;&s;ions are &s;hort; I know by experience that the ideas of the &s;oul can run be|yond what can be communicated by words.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARY.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you think this is too good news to be true, go to the Scriptures and &s;earch for your|&s;elf: I de&s;ire to a&s;&s;ert nothing for truth in matters of religion, but what can be proved by the Scrip|tures; and what I find there I depend upon for certain truth. We read of the godly man, that what&s;oever he doth &s;hall pro&s;per. And there is no want to them that fear the LORD. As the moun|tains are round about <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> &s;o the LORD is round about them that fear him&punc; Ble&s;&s;ed are all they that put their tru&s;t in him. The ble&s;&s;ed JE|SUS &s;peaks plainly of this matter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n <HI>Matt.</HI> vi. 24, to the end of the chap. CHRIST &s;aith, See that ye be not troubled. Fear not is often repeated. But the Scriptures that prove the care the LORD takes of his children, and their &s;afety and duty to tru&s;t them&s;elves and all they have in his hands, are too numerous to repeat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARTHA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly the Scriptures are full of &s;uch con&s;olations; I &s;ee they fully prove more than you have &s;aid. Our glorious Redeemer takes &s;uch con&s;tant care and particular notice of his children, that there &s;hall not an hair of their head peri&s;h without his leave. And he hath &s;urely pro|mi&s;ed over and over, by many words, that he will do them good. I &s;ee that I am a fooli&s;h child. I have troubled my&s;elf about things that did not belong to me. I mourn to think of what I have done. I have been as it were trying to take the LORD's work out of his hands, and the work he hath appointed for me to do I have too much ne|glected. O that I could always live as happy as
<PB N="7" REF="023767_0008_0FC11608044B0790">
you do when you &s;it weeping at the feet of our lovely JESUS! I know by experience that's a joyful place to &s;it at So joyful that I believe none ever &s;it there long before they weep for joy. Tho' I am too careful and troubled about many things, yet at &s;ome happy moments I have known the joy of weeping at my Ma&s;ter's feet. At fir&s;t I began to weep for &s;orrow, but as &s;oon as I heard his &s;oul-reviving voice I began to weep for joy. And while you have been telling how happy we might live, my own experience appears and gives in a witne&s;s of the truth of what you &s;ay.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can join with you in mourning my folly. I al&s;o wi&s;h that I could always live as hap|py as you do when you &s;it weeping at the Ma&s;ter's feet: But I am a&s;hamed of my&s;elf; I &s;ee that the proper place for me to be is, not only at the feet of CHRIST but al&s;o at the feet of all his children. I think I &s;hould be thankful if I may be permitted like a dog to pick up the crumbs that fall from the ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter's table, where he feeds his children. When I take a view of my&s;elf, I can find no good there, all looks dark and melancho|ly. Self is an unplea&s;ant field for meditation. If I &s;tay there long&punc; I &s;hall be in danger of &s;tarving.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARTHA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Self is an unplea&s;ant field indeed; but I am &s;o fooli&s;h that I &s;tay there &s;ometimes until my &s;oul is almo&s;t &s;tarved to death.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARY.</SPEAKER>
<P>We &s;hould &s;tay looking of our&s;elves no longer than ju&s;t to &s;ee that there is no good there, and then ha&s;ten away from this barren wilderne&s;s, and enter the plea&s;ant field where our beloved Savior &s;hews his mo&s;t beautiful face. Let us be &s;peaking of the glory of his kingdom, and telling of his wondrous works. Let us be me|ditating
<PB N="8" REF="023767_0009_0FC11609B30C6F88">
of his power, and telling of his &s;alvation from day to day. Let us behold and admire the infiniti perfections of our GOD, until we can &s;ay thou art altogether lovely; thou ha&s;t made me glad through thy work, and I will triumph in the works of thy hands. O how &s;weet and now plea|&s;ant! Here's matter enough to afford a joyful &s;ong! We may glory in the LORD and rejoice in the LORD; our &s;ouls may make their boa&s;t in the LORD. Let us walk out into this field to meditate. This field is &s;o large and contains &s;uch a variety of beauties and plea&s;ures, we may be always finding &s;omething new. Here is to be found all manner of precious fruits for the &s;oul to feed upon. Here we may glean a little &s;uch food as we expect to live upon in the heavenly world Therefore let none ever meet us in any other field.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly this is a &s;weet field for meditation: I have &s;pent many &s;weet hours there in times pa&s;t, and I could wi&s;h it might be the place of my a|bode: But alas I live a mourner's life! I conclude I am more ea&s;ily led a&s;tray than any other mortal that ever ta&s;ted of the love of JESUS. For when at any time my dear LORD leads me away from all my troubles into the field of plea&s;ure, and there my &s;oul begins to fea&s;t and take delight, then &s;ome trifling care, or &s;ome vain temptation comes and takes me by the hand, and I am &s;o fooli&s;h that away I go, and for&s;ake the paths of upright|ne&s;s to walk in the ways of darkne&s;s: Then I am in trouble, and many &s;orrows compa&s;s me about. Thus I de&s;troy my&s;elf; but I cannot help my|&s;elf. What &s;hall I do in &s;uch a ca&s;e? How &s;hall I get back when I have run away from CHRIST?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will try to an&s;wer your que&s;tion ac|cording
<PB N="9" REF="023767_0010_0FC11612DA28F1F8">
to the te&s;timony of Scripture, and the witne&s;s of experience. It is a mournful and a &s;hameful thing to run away from the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, who is the &s;pring of all our life, joy and plea&s;ure. But &s;ince we are &s;uch fooli&s;h chil|dren that we are very apt to leave our Father's rich table to feed among the &s;wine, how &s;hall we get back again? We can run away from CHRIST, but we can never return to him again without his &s;pecial a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but yet there is a duty for us to do, tho' fallen never &s;o low. We are active creatures, and therefore we mu&s;t be active in returning again to our Father's hou&s;e. Tho' we are &s;unk as low, and bound as fa&s;t as <HI>Jo|nah</HI> was, yet from thence we mu&s;t look towards his holy temple, and cry to him that is able to help us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARTHA.</SPEAKER>
<P>But &s;ometimes I am in a wor&s;e ca&s;e than <HI>Jonah,</HI> when he was in the whales belly: for tho' he had no way to help him&s;elf, yet he had praying breath, &s;o that he could cry to the LORD for help and was heard and &s;oon relieved. But as for me I am often &s;wallowed up by worldly cares or carnal &s;ecurity, or &s;omething as bad, and carried down the &s;tream again&s;t my will, and yet I have no heart to pray, and it &s;eems like mockery to a&s;k for help in words when the LORD knows my heart is not engaged therein.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARY.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a &s;ad ca&s;e indeed; but even in &s;uch a ca&s;e we ought to pray and not to faint. If we &s;tay here and yield to &s;in, and give over trying to a&s;k for help we &s;hall be in danger of growing harder and harder, until our la&s;t &s;tate is wor&s;e than the fir&s;t. (Not that I think any will utter|ly fall from &s;aving grace; but grace will &s;urely
<PB N="10" REF="023767_0011_0FC11613F0B567F8">
teach all that po&s;&s;e&s;s it to pray.) Therefore we mu&s;t exert all our power in begging and pleading to the LORD for help, and never give over tho' he gives us no an&s;wer, or tho' the enemy tells us to hold our peace, yet let us cry &s;o much the more. Tho' the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS &s;hould long hide his face; and at length frown upon us and tell us it is not meet to give children's bread to &s;uch dogs as we he; yet we mu&s;t not give out for that, but ac|knowledge the truth thereof; yet plead with the dogs to be permitted to eat of the children's crumbs. We mu&s;t, like the poor prodigal, re&s;olve to return, tho' we feel our&s;elves a great way off in a foreign land and our compa&s;&s;ionate Father will run to meet his returning children. He pities them when he &s;ees them toiling all night for no|thing; and he is plea&s;ed with their earne&s;t en|deavors, tho' he knows that without him they can do nothing. The love of our Redeemer is &s;uch, that when he &s;ees we can live no longer without him, he will appear and turn our night into day, and our &s;orrow &s;hall be &s;weetened with joy. O how our hearts rejoice to &s;ee our LORD again, after we have been enclo&s;ed in clouds and thick darkne&s;s! Glory to his name that he blots out as a cloud our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and as a thick cloud our &s;ins, and comes for our relief: When all other refuge fails us, the Beauty of Heaven comes leaping on the mountains, and &s;kipping on the hills. Then we mourn and rejoice at the &s;ame time; our own works make us mourn, and cau&s;e us &s;hame. We &s;ee that to us belongs no|thing but &s;hame and confu&s;ion of face becau&s;e we have &s;inned again&s;t &s;uch a holy GOD; but we rejoice in the LORD who is the rock of our &s;alva|tion.
<PB N="11" REF="023767_0012_0FC1161725411C00">
Then we re&s;olve never to run away from our lovely JESUS again. We long to get more near to him &s;till. His love is &s;o attracting, that the more we &s;ee of his glory, the more we long to &s;ee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARTHA.</SPEAKER>
<P>When this is the happy ca&s;e, how &s;hall we keep our&s;elves in the love of GOD?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARY.</SPEAKER>
<P>None but the LORD can keep us, yet he hath appointed a work for us to do, &s;o that we ought to be as active as tho' we could do all our|&s;elves. We mu&s;t work out our own &s;alvation with fear and trembling; yet every &s;oul that o|beys this command knows it is GOD that works within them both to will and to do of his good plea&s;ure. This is a mi&s;tery that cannot be un|folded by words as it may be under&s;tood by feel|ing the truth thereof by experience. I think by Scripture and experience that the only way to live in the &s;en&s;ible po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the love of GOD, is to keep his commands: As JESUS &s;ays, <HI>He that lov|eth me will keep my commands, and my Father will love him, and we will come and make our abode with him.</HI> We mu&s;t watch and pray continually&punc; tho' at &s;ome happy moments we may feel as tho' the danger is all pa&s;t, and the enemies are all dead; but there is never more need of watching than at &s;uch a time; for our enemies are &s;till alive and lie hid waiting to &s;ee us led down our watch. Therefore let us hold fa&s;t what we have received, and &s;ee that we do not lo&s;e the ground that thro' grace we have gained. We mu&s;t pray without cea&s;ing, for all our &s;trength and help comes from CHRIST. We mu&s;t watch and &s;earch, and &s;tudy and pray to know what our LORD would have us to do. Our happine&s;s greatly con&s;i&s;ts in doing his will. It was the meat of our great Redeemer to
<PB N="12" REF="023767_0013_0FC1161CF096F700">
do his Father's will and to fini&s;h his work: And O how &s;weetly do his children grow when they feed upon the &s;ame heavenly meat! If ye know the&s;e things, happy are ye if ye do them. If we long to glorify GOD let us bear much fruit. We mu&s;t al&s;o watch again&s;t every motion of &s;in: Re|&s;i&s;t the fir&s;t vain thought that comes: Keep our hearts with all diligence: Take heed le&s;t our evil hearts depart from the LORD. And tho' our ene|mies are lively and &s;trong, too &s;trong for us, yet the weapons of earne&s;t prayer will prevail when nothing el&s;e will do, if we are but con&s;tant to fight again&s;t our &s;piritual enemies, through the &s;trength of CHRIST, we &s;hall &s;urely prevail again&s;t them. Re&s;i&s;t the devil and CHRIST will make him flee. I &s;peak by experience (and I think it agrees with the Scriptures.) Whenever I have been engaged in war again&s;t my &s;ins, tho' I had no &s;trength of my own, yet the LORD &s;uffered not my enemies to triumph over me; but as &s;oon as I grew carele&s;s and laid down my weapons, my ene|mies prevailed and brought me into bondage; and there my wi&s;e LORD let me be, until I &s;aw my folly and ta&s;ted the bitter fruit of unwatchfulne&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARTHA.</SPEAKER>
<P>My experience bears witne&s;s to the truth of the&s;e things, and I re&s;olve to try to be more watchful than I have been; but I know I can do nothing in my own &s;trength. I think I &s;ee the narrow way, and it looks exceeding bright and beautiful, and I long to walk therein. But there is nothing more ba&s;e than I am. I &s;ee I am much defiled with &s;in. O for deliverance from &s;in! It is &s;in is the cau&s;e of all my trouble. I would do good, but evil is pre&s;ent with me. I know that in me, that is in my fle&s;h dwells no good thing.

He is able to clean&s;e my defiled &s;oul by that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ighty power, whereby he is able to &s;ubdue all things to him&s;elf.

Now I can tru&s;t my&s;elf, &s;oul and body and all my concerns for time and eternity, in the hands of this lovely One. He will perform all things for me exactly right. I &s;ee that he hath done all things well. Why have I been &s;o careful and troubled about many things, when there is but one thing needful?
