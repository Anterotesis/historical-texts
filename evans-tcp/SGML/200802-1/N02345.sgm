<HEAD>A Remarkable RELATION OF A <HI>Cockatrice</HI> cru&s;h'd in the Egg.</HEAD>
<P>A Ve&s;&s;el of that &s;ort which they call, a <HI>Snoe,</HI> belonging to certain Merchants in <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and commanded by <HI>John Green,</HI> of that City, &s;ailed from <HI>Jamaica,</HI> &s;ome time in <HI>April,</HI> 1726. bound for <HI>Guinea.</HI> The Boat|&s;wain, <HI>William Fly,</HI> having before concerted with &s;ome aboard, (in a way of Revenge, they &s;aid, for <HI>Bad U&s;age</HI>) the De&s;truction of the <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> and the <HI>Mate,</HI> and the proper <HI>Con&s;equences,</HI> on May 27. a|bout One a Clock in the Morning, he, with one <HI>Alexander Mitchel,</HI> went into the Cabin, and &s;iezing on the Ma&s;ter, held his Hands, while <HI>Mitchel</HI> wounded him. Then they hawled him up; who perceiving their Intention to throw him overboard, beg'd, <HI>For the Lord's &s;ake, don't throw me overboard; For if you do, you throw me into Hell immediately.</HI> But <HI>Fly</HI> bid him &s;ay, <HI>Lord, Have Mercy on my Soul</HI>! And when he &s;iezed the Main&s;heets with his Hand, to prolong his Time, the mercile&s;s Mon&s;ters, with a Cooper's Broad-axe, cut off his Hand, and threw him over-board. While this was a doing, one <HI>Samuel Cole,</HI> pre&s;ently a&s;&s;i&s;ted with <HI>Mitchel</HI> and one <HI>Winthrop,</HI> &s;ecured the Mate, who&s;e Name was
<PB N="2" REF="002779_0004_0FE5F5906AFF4B30">
<HI>Thomas Jenkins,</HI> and brought him upon Deck, tel|ling him, <HI>that he &s;hould go after the Ma&s;ter.</HI> Accor|dingly, having fir&s;t cut him down the Shoulder with a Broad-axe, they threw him over, ju&s;t be|fore the Main Shrouds. After he was thrown o|ver, he cried out unto the Doctor, <HI>For the Lord's &s;ake, to fling him a Rope.</HI> But <HI>Fly</HI> &s;oon &s;ecured the Doctor, and put him in Irons; and confined the Gunner al&s;o and the Carpenter, who were not for their Turn.</P>
<P>Two Days after this, they met one of the Ships, that came out in Company with <HI>Green,</HI> and hailing them, ask'd, How Captain <HI>Green</HI> did. They an|&s;wered, <HI>Very well! At your Service</HI>! But upon con|&s;ulting, whether they had be&s;t attack that Ship, they left her, in Con&s;ideration, That they had not Hands enough to Man her. So, they bore away for <HI>North-Carolina</HI>; Where, off Cape <HI>Hattaras</HI> Bar, on June 3. there lay a Sloop at Anchor, whereof the Commander was one who&s;e Name is <HI>Fulker.</HI> Some of the Sloop's Hands went aboard <HI>Fly,</HI> who was now become the Captain of the <HI>Snoe,</HI> &s;uppo|&s;ing them to want a Pilot. <HI>Fly</HI> commanded <HI>Fulker</HI> aboard, and informed him, <HI>They were Gentlemen of Fortune</HI>; and let him know, that they mu&s;t have the <HI>Sloop,</HI> if it &s;ailed better than the <HI>Snoe.</HI> The contrary Winds rendring the <HI>Sloop</HI> unable to be brought off, our New Captain fell into a great Pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;wore he would burn her, and bring|ing <HI>Fulker</HI> to the Geers, (who it &s;eems, unadvi&s;ed|ly provoked them) inflicted a &s;evere Scourging upon him. The Boats Crue, could not bring the <HI>Sloop</HI> any further than the Bar, but there &s;he bilg'd and &s;ank: and the Pirates endeavoured then to &s;et
<PB N="3" REF="002779_0005_0FE5F5BCA8E6DEF8">
her on Fire, but could not make the Fire to take. <HI>Fulker</HI> and his Men, and his Pa&s;&s;engers, were de|tained Pri&s;oners by <HI>Fly</HI>; But on June 5. they &s;ail|ed from thence; and on the Day following they &s;aw a Ship commanded by one who&s;e Name is <HI>Gale,</HI> bound from <HI>Barbados</HI> to <HI>Virginia.</HI> They could not come up with <HI>Gale</HI> till the next Morning; when they hoi&s;ted their <HI>Black Flag,</HI> and fired &s;everal Guns at the Ship; and there being little Wind&punc; <HI>Gale</HI> &s;truck; and <HI>Fly</HI> made the Men his Pri&s;oners; but robbed the Ship only of &s;everal Sails, and &s;ome Cloaths and &s;mall Arms; and after a Captivity of Two Days relea&s;ed them; at the &s;ame time giving <HI>Fulker,</HI> and one of his Pa&s;&s;engers, and a Servant, and <HI>Green</HI>'s Doctor, their Liberty. However they forceably detained one <HI>William Atkin&s;on,</HI> who had been Commander of a Brigantine, but left her for a Pa&s;&s;age home in <HI>Fulker,</HI> bound then for <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI>: And who had often declared, That if the <HI>Pirates</HI> ever took him, he would humour them, till he could &s;ee his fir&s;t Opportunity to ri&s;e upon them. They wanted him to be their <HI>Pilot,</HI> for the Coa&s;t of <HI>New-England</HI>; which they told him&punc; he &s;hould be, or, <HI>They would blow his Brains out.</HI> It &s;eems, they forgot, how bad a Coa&s;t <HI>New-England</HI> has been for <HI>Pirates</HI> to come upon! Off of <HI>Delaware Bay,</HI> they met a Sloop commanded by one <HI>Harris</HI> bound from <HI>New-York</HI> to <HI>Pen&s;ilvania,</HI> having about Fifty Scotch-Iri&s;h Pa&s;&s;engers aboard; which upon their hoi&s;ting of their <HI>Black Flag</HI> Surrendred unto them. After they had a little ran&s;ack'd the Ve&s;&s;el, and kept her twenty four Hours, they forced a Lu&s;ty Blade, one <HI>James Benbrook,</HI> from her, and &s;o di&s;mi&s;s'd her. <HI>Fly</HI> bore away for <HI>Martha's Vineyard,</HI> pretend|ing
<PB N="4" REF="002779_0006_0FE5F5BFB3E82D70">
to Water there, and &s;o away for <HI>Guinea</HI>; But the <HI>Pilot</HI> purpo&s;ely mi&s;s'd the port, (whereat <HI>Fly</HI> was very angry,) and on June 23. bearing Ea&s;tward, they mett with a <HI>Fi&s;hing Schooner,</HI> on <HI>Browns</HI> Bank; from which upon <HI>Fly</HI>'s hoi&s;ting his <HI>Black Flag,</HI> and threatning to &s;ink her, the Ma&s;ter came aboard them, &amp; <HI>Fly</HI> told him, he mu&s;t have the <HI>Schooner,</HI> unle&s;s he could inform him, where to get a better Sailor. A|bout Noon, they &s;aw &s;ome other <HI>Schooners</HI>; and <HI>Fly</HI> &s;ent that <HI>Schooner</HI> with &s;even hands after them. <HI>Fly</HI> (who had now entirely &s;old him&s;elf to the God of <HI>Ekron,</HI>) and Three other Pirates, whereof one (<HI>Samuel Cole</HI> afore&s;aid, was in Irons upon Su&s;|picion of Mutiny, remained aboard the <HI>Snoe</HI>; and fifteen others that had been taken by him; namely, <HI>Fulkers</HI> Mate, a couple of his Boys, <HI>Green</HI>'s Gunner and Carpenter, five of <HI>Gale</HI>'s Men, <HI>Benbrook,</HI> Three Fi&s;hermen belonging to the <HI>Schooner,</HI> and our <HI>Atkin|&s;on.</HI> While the <HI>Pirates</HI> were gone upon their cha&s;e, there appeared in Sight &s;everal other Fi&s;hing-Ve&s;|&s;els; and <HI>Atkin&s;on</HI> by telling <HI>Fly</HI> what he &s;aw, drew him forward, from his two Loaden <HI>Guns,</HI> and <HI>Sword,</HI> which he had with him; and while <HI>Fly</HI> &s;att on the <HI>Windlace</HI> with his Pro&s;pective-Gla&s;s, <HI>Benbrook</HI> and <HI>Walker,</HI> (who had been <HI>Fulker</HI>'s Mate) upon the Direction from <HI>Atkin&s;on,</HI> &s;ecured <HI>Fly,</HI> and put him in Irons; and <HI>Atkin&s;on</HI> &s;truck another of the <HI>Pirates</HI>; and with the Help of the Carpenter, &s;oon confi|ned the other Two.

<P>We can do no more, but with <HI>Tears</HI> [which, alas, you have not for your&s;elf!] Lament the unaccoun|table and unparallel'd <HI>Obduration</HI> that you are given up unto; and Be&s;eech you to <HI>Con&s;ider your ways</HI>; and &s;end up our Cries unto the GOD of all Grace, to be&s;tow a <HI>New,</HI> and a <HI>Right,</HI> and a <HI>Soft Heart</HI> upon you.</P>

<P>Poor <HI>Sons of Death</HI>; Be attentive to the <HI>Words of Life</HI>; and Hearken as for Eternity.</P>
<P>You are in mo&s;t affecting Circum&s;tances. If you Dy two or three Days hence, in ill Terms with Heaven, you will be doom'd and thrown into Mi|&s;eries, inconceivably more grievous, than any things which you ever have in this World been vexed with|al. Your <HI>Spirits</HI> will be continually tortured with the furious and rending Scourges of a <HI>Guilty Con|&s;cience.</HI> An Infinite GOD will arm your <HI>Con&s;cience</HI>

to make direful Reflections on your pa&s;t Mi&s;beha|viours. You will fall into the Hands of <HI>Devils</HI>; you may gue&s;s a little, how <HI>they</HI> will handle you, by <HI>your</HI> way of handling one another.

<P>[<HI>The An&s;wers, being mo&s;tly but words of Compli|ance, there will be no need of Reciting them, and Repe|ting them.</HI>]</P>
<P>'Tis by coming into the <HI>Covenant</HI> of GOD and of <HI>Grace,</HI> that you are to <HI>Lay hold on Eternal Life.</HI> Behold, the meaning of that <HI>Covenant,</HI> and the man|ner of coming into it.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t apprehend, That the Eternal SON of GOD, has in a <HI>Covenant</HI> with His Eternal FA|THER, engaged, That He will bring His People to <HI>Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s</HI>; &mdash; bring them to all the <HI>Good,</HI> which a GOD of Infinite <HI>Goodne&s;s,</HI> has purpo&s;ed for them.

<P>One Thing Engaged by our Lord-REDEE|MER, is, To offer up a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> unto <HI>Divine Ju&s;|tice</HI> to make Atonement for them; and undergo the &s;ad Things which are due to them for their Sins, that &s;o they may be delivered from them.

<P>Now, Do you <HI>Con&s;ent,</HI> unto This; To be <HI>For|given</HI> of GOD, on the account of the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> your SAVIOUR has pre&s;ented for you?</P>

<P>Well; But another Thing Engaged by our Lord-REDEEMER is, To make &s;uitable Impre&s;&s;ions on the <HI>Souls</HI> of His Cho&s;en; To fill them with the <HI>Love</HI> of GOD and their Neighbour; To <HI>Heal</HI> all that is ami&s;s in them; To <HI>Quicken</HI> them for Liv|ing to GOD; And <HI>work</HI> in them what is <HI>well plea|&s;ing in the &s;ight of GOD</HI>; and Conform them to His <HI>Will</HI> in every thing; and render all <HI>Sin</HI> Odious to them; and incline them to every thing that is <HI>Holy</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>Good</HI>; and fit them for, and bring them to, the <HI>Heavenly world.</HI></P>
<P>For <HI>you,</HI> This remains to be done. Do you <HI>con|&s;ent,</HI> That He'l do all this for you, and in you?&mdash;</P>
<P>Do you Re&s;ign your&s;elf up to His Holy SPIRIT, that He may do &s;o? &mdash;</P>
<P>In&s;tead of &s;aying, <HI>I will Fear GOD and Serve Him,</HI> do you &s;ay, <HI>O my SAVIOUR, I de&s;ire, that by Thee Living in me, I may Fear GOD, and Serve Him</HI>!</P>
<P>So, you are willing, that your SAVIOUR <HI>fulfil in you and for you, all the Good plea&s;ure of His Good|ne&s;s</HI>!</P>

We are a Congregation of <HI>Dy|ing People.</HI> The Danger of our <HI>Dying without Wi&s;|dom,</HI> 'tis incident unto us; 'tis threatning of us; we cannot be too <HI>deeply</HI> affected with it.

<P>A <HI>Compari&s;on</HI> is in&s;tituted between <HI>Angels</HI> and <HI>Men</HI>; to prove, That if <HI>Angels</HI> mu&s;t aba&s;e them|&s;elves before GOD, and lay a&s;ide all boa&s;ting pre|ten&s;ions to <HI>perfection,</HI> much more mu&s;t Men do &s;o.

What Man is he that liveth,</HI> let him live never &s;o piou&s;ly, never &s;o prayerfully, never &s;o Fruitfully, who <HI>&s;hall not &s;ee Death, or deliver his Soul from the hand of the Grave?</HI> In fine, It was a Sentence in the Wi&s;dom of the Ancients; <HI>Is Vir non e&s;t, qui lapides atque edificia cor|ruere, et homines mori miratur.</HI> The Man that won|ders to &s;ee <HI>Buildings fall,</HI> and <HI>People dy,</HI> is not worthy the Name of a <HI>Man.</HI> I remember <HI>Po&s;idonius</HI> in the Life of <HI>Au&s;tin,</HI> tells us, how much that Great Man was affected with that Sentence, a little before his own going out of the World.

<P N="2">II. The &s;econd Thing before us, is, A much <HI>wor&s;e unhpppine&s;s</HI> that befalls the <HI>mo&s;t of men,</HI> and the <HI>wor&s;t unhappine&s;s</HI> that any Man can have befalling of him. The mo&s;t of Men, <HI>dy</HI> before they have arri|ved unto the only true <HI>Wi&s;dom.</HI> Few Men are <HI>wi&s;e</HI> before they <HI>Dy.</HI> Thus this clau&s;e is well carri|ed by Expo&s;itors; <HI>Prius moriuntur quam quicquam intellexerunt de Divina Sapientia.</HI> They <HI>Dy</HI> before they know what <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> is: They <HI>dy</HI> &s;trangers, to Divine, Real, Saving <HI>Wi&s;dom.</HI> All Men are, <HI>born
<PB N="33" REF="002779_0035_0FE5F64A50D599D0">
Fools.</HI> We read, Job 11.12. <HI>Born like the wild-A&s;&s;es Colt.</HI> And the mo&s;t of Men <HI>Dy Fools.</HI> The <HI>lives</HI> of Men are generally &s;pent in <HI>Folly.</HI> And they <HI>dy</HI> before the cure of their <HI>Folly.</HI></P>
<P>We will Enquire; Fir&s;t, <HI>Whence it proceeds,</HI> that the mo&s;t of Men, <HI>dy</HI> before they arrive unto <HI>Wi&s;|dom?</HI> You may be &s;ure, The <HI>Fall of Man</HI> is the cau&s;e of this evil. Man was ambitious of <HI>Wi&s;dom.</HI> The Temptation of the <HI>Forbidden Fruit</HI> was, <HI>A Tree to be de&s;ired, to make one wi&s;e.</HI> But Man by his <HI>Fall</HI> has lo&s;t his <HI>Wi&s;dom.</HI> A <HI>Darkne&s;s</HI> is come upon his Mind. His perver&s;e Mind is now naturally di&s;po&s;|ed unto <HI>Error.</HI> He is naturally <HI>Ignorant, and out of the way.</HI> His Faculties, to di&s;cern <HI>wi&s;ely</HI> what is <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Good,</HI> are horribly wounded by his <HI>Fall</HI> from God. It is now come to pa&s;s, that the Children of Men come under that Character; Rom. 3.16.17. &mdash;<HI>The way of Peace they have not know.</HI> And becau&s;e the depraved Soul of Man <HI>loves</HI> his <HI>Error,</HI> therefore the Holy God <HI>leaves</HI> him in it. Becau&s;e he will not be reclaimed from it, God lets him go on in his <HI>Error.</HI> Becau&s;e he <HI>hates the Light,</HI> God witholds it from him. He Delights in his <HI>Darkne&s;s,</HI> &amp; prefers and practi&s;es the <HI>Works of Darkne&s;s</HI>; God therefore gives him up to his <HI>Darkne&s;s.</HI> We may add, what we read; 2. Cor. 4.4. <HI>The god of this world blinded their Minds. Satan</HI> is by the wrath of God, become the <HI>Ruler of this Dark World.</HI> Men do by Sin put them&s;elves under the Dominion of <HI>Satan. Satan</HI> &s;huts his poor Slaves up in tho&s;e <HI>Dungeons,</HI> where the Rayes of <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> do not reach them.

<P>Secondly. We will Enquire, <HI>How it appears,</HI> that the mo&s;t of Men <HI>Dy</HI> before they arrive unto <HI>Wi&s;|dom.</HI> There needs no &s;tronger, nor no &s;adder proof of this, than what we have in the Daily <HI>Com|plaints</HI> of <HI>Dying Men.</HI> Some <HI>Dy</HI> with very little &s;en&s;e of what has been ami&s;s in their Lives. <HI>Mad|ne&s;s</HI> has been in their <HI>Hearts while they have lived,</HI> &amp; with that <HI>Madne&s;s</HI> they have <HI>gone to the Dead.</HI> But, of them who are not perfect <HI>Sotts</HI> and <HI>Stones</HI> in their <HI>Death,</HI> the mo&s;t by far, <HI>dy</HI> confe&s;&s;ing and complain|ing, that they have been without <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> all their Dayes. They own, they have never come unto <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> until their <HI>Dying Hour</HI> be come upon them. And it is well, if <HI>now</HI> they do any more, than &s;ee that they have been without <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI>; it is well if <HI>now</HI> they come really to get any of that <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> which they have been thus long without. We read, Prov. 5.11, 12. of, <HI>Mourning at the la&s;t, How have I hated In&s;truction!</HI> The mo&s;t of Men go on fool|i&s;hly all their days, in &s;uch Indi&s;cretions, that they <HI>mourn at the la&s;t</HI>;
<Q>Oh! If <HI>I were to live over again,</HI> I would never lead my Life &s;o <HI>fooli&s;hly</HI> as I have done! I would order my <HI>Life</HI> after another and a wi&s;er Manner than I have done!</Q>
When that fa|mous Roman <HI>Cicero,</HI> was come towards the latter End of his <HI>Life,</HI> he cried out, <HI>O me nunquam pru|den&s;em!</HI> 'Alas, I have never done the part of a <HI>'Wi&s;e Man,</HI> in all my Days. Thus do the mo&s;t of Men cry out of them&s;elves, at a <HI>latter End</HI> full of <HI>Bitterne&s;s. Dying</HI> Men &s;ay; <HI>We have lived without

Wi&s;dom.</HI> At their <HI>Death</HI> 'tis found and own'd, they have been without it. In a <HI>Dying</HI> Hour to be for|ced unto the Confe&s;&s;ion, <HI>I have until now been whol|ly de&s;titute of Wi&s;dom!</HI> And now, no opportunity to <HI>Exert</HI> it, or, perhaps to <HI>obtain</HI> it! &mdash;</P>
<P>We will Enquire, Thirdly. <HI>Who they are,</HI> which <HI>Dy</HI> before they arrive unto <HI>Wi&s;dom.</HI> You &s;hall &s;hall have a brief De&s;cription of them.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, They who <HI>Dy Unprepared for Death,</HI> &s;uch <HI>Dy without Wi&s;dom.</HI> The true&s;t <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> of Man, lies, of old they &s;aid, <HI>In a Meditation of Death</HI>; I will &s;ay, <HI>In a Preparation for death. Death</HI> finds none but Egregious <HI>Fools Unprepared</HI> for it. We are warned, That before we <HI>dy,</HI> we mu&s;t be <HI>prepared</HI> for it, by a <HI>Sanctifying Change</HI> upon us; <HI>Prepared</HI> for it, by be|ing <HI>Renewed in the Spirit of our Minds: Prepared</HI> for it, by turning to God, and Clo&s;ing with Chri&s;t, &amp; having the Di&s;po&s;itions which will render us <HI>meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in light.</HI> We are warned, That if we <HI>dy</HI> before we are thus <HI>Prepared</HI> for it, it will be <HI>Good for us, that we had never been born.</HI> Our <HI>Death</HI> will be but a &s;ort of a <HI>Trap door,</HI> by which we &s;hall be thrown down into the place of <HI>Dragons,</HI> a place of <HI>Torments.</HI> It can be no <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> to &s;light this warning, and neglect this <HI>Preparation</HI> for Death. Unto one <HI>Unprepared for death,</HI> it was &s;aid; Luk. 12.20. <HI>Thou Fool!</HI> Oh! how ju&s;tly, how ju&s;tly may it be &s;aid unto &s;uch an one; <HI>Ah, Fool, dying without Wi&s;dom!</HI> The <HI>unprepared</HI> Soul, tumbles into a dreadful Eternity, with &s;uch a &s;hriek as that;
<Q>What a <HI>Fool,</HI> Oh! what a <HI>Fool,</HI> have I been! What horrible <HI>Stripes</HI> has my <HI>Folly</HI> brought me to!</Q></P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="002779_0038_0FE5F65591FD6C48">Secondly. They who <HI>dy, before they have begun to live,</HI> &s;hall <HI>dy without Wi&s;dom.</HI> A Man does not <HI>be|gin to live,</HI> until he <HI>lives unto God.</HI> He that never begins to mind the Great <HI>Errand,</HI> which GOD &s;ent him into the World upon, has not <HI>begun to live.</HI> He that fills not his Life with <HI>Acknowledgements</HI> of GOD, and &s;tudies not to <HI>Acknowledge God in all his ways,</HI> has not <HI>begun to live.</HI> He that lives wholly <HI>to him&s;elf,</HI> and &s;weels away his Life, only in the <HI>Hurries,</HI> and the <HI>Plea&s;ures,</HI> and <HI>Amu&s;ements</HI> of <HI>this Life</HI>; may have it &s;aid of him, as, 1 Tim. 5.6. <HI>He is dead, while he lives.</HI> 'Tis not <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI>; No, 'Tis <HI>Folly in its Exaltation,</HI> to live at this rate.

<P>Thirdly. They who <HI>dy in their Sins,</HI> the&s;e <HI>dy with|out Wi&s;dom. Sin</HI> is <HI>Folly.</HI> Every Sinner is a <HI>Fool.</HI> In &s;inning we bring our &s;elves into cau&s;e for &s;aying, as, 2 Sam. 24.10. <HI>I have &s;inned, and I have done very fooli&s;hly.</HI> Men are not come to <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> till they have left off <HI>&s;inning,</HI> or, while they go on &s;till in their <HI>Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es.</HI> If Men <HI>dy</HI> before they are <HI>Con|verted from the Error of their ways,</HI> they <HI>dy without Wi&s;dom.</HI> To <HI>dy Unpardoned,</HI> is to <HI>dy Mi&s;erable.</HI> To <HI>dy</HI> with Sin unbewailed, and unfor&s;aken, and unre|pented of, is to <HI>dy Unpardoned.</HI> So to <HI>dy</HI> &mdash; with <HI>Folly</HI> not abandoned, nor forgiven; To <HI>dy,</HI> with <HI>the Wrath of God yet abiding</HI> on the Soul; To <HI>dy,</HI> and carry away a <HI>Guilty Con&s;cience,</HI> which will gnaw, and &s;courge, and vex the Soul, and be within it, a <HI>Worm that will never dy</HI>!

Skill of <HI>Living U&s;efully</HI>; if your <HI>Death</HI> cut you down, before you are grown <HI>Fruitful in good Works</HI>; and bring forth much <HI>Fruit unto God.</HI> Oh! Beware of this.</P>
<P>Fifthly.

<P>Such Things you have a thou&s;and and a thou|&s;and times heard from the Quivering <HI>Lips,</HI> that have had an Immortal Soul ju&s;t Expiring from them.

The Sullen and Raging Mood, into which he fell, upon his be|ing fir&s;t <HI>Impri&s;on'd,</HI> cau&s;ed him to break forth into furious Execrations, and Bla&s;phemies too hideous to be mention'd; and not eat one mor&s;el of any thing, but &s;ub&s;i&s;t only upon a little Drinking, for al|mo&s;t all the remaining part of his Life. He decli|ned appearing in the Public A&s;&s;emblies, on the <HI>Lords-day,</HI> with the other Pri&s;oners, to be under the appointed means of Grace, becau&s;e, for&s;ooth, <HI>he would not have the Mob to gaze upon him.</HI> He &s;eem'd all along ambitious to have it &s;aid, <HI>That he died a brave fellow</HI>&punc; He pa&s;s'd along to the place of Exe|cution, with a <HI>No&s;egay</HI> in his hand, and making his <HI>Complements,</HI> where he <HI>thought he &s;aw occa&s;ion.</HI> Arri|ving there, he nimbly mounted the Stage, and would fain have put on a Smiling A&s;pect.

<P>At the &s;ame time, he declared his ob&s;tinate Re|fu&s;al, to <HI>Forgive</HI> the Per&s;on that had been the In|&s;trument of bringing him to Ju&s;tice.
