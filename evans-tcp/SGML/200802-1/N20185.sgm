Elder <HI>ISAIAH WILCOX,</HI> Pa&s;tor of the Seperate Bapti&s;t Church in <HI>We&s;terly,</HI> who died of the Small-pox, the third day of March, 1793, after a few days illne&s;s; which he bore with great patience and fortitude of mind&mdash;and is much lamented by his Church and People, and by his Friends in general. And has left a &s;orrowful widow and family with|out a Shepherd, as well as his Church; but may the great Shepherd of I&s;rael their Shep|herd be through time; and &s;afely conduct them through unto the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y Canaan.</HEAD>

<L>OH! may this loud and &s;udden call,</L>
<L>To us a warning be;</L>
<L>To all that are within our walls,</L>
<L>And tho&s;e that di&s;tant be.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>By a mo&s;t &s;ore &s;urpri&s;ing &s;hock,</L>
<L>Wrought by the powers above;</L>
<L>A worthy Shepherd of a flock,</L>
<L>Is late by death remov'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Who was a patern of the age,</L>
<L>Of grace and piety;</L>
<L>But now has quit this mortal &s;tage,</L>
<L>And here no more can be.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The tents of ea&s;e he long for&s;ook,</L>
<L>Religion did per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ue;</L>
<L>And in the vineyard of his Lord,</L>
<L>Much labour did be&s;tow.</L>

<LG>
<L>He to his numerous family,</L>
<L>Mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> was and kind;</L>
<L>And may it well remember'd be</L>
<L>By tho&s;e that's left behind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But by a &s;udden illne&s;s &s;eiz'd,</L>
<L>Amid&s;t his worldly cares;</L>
<L>Not many days he did &s;urvive,</L>
<L>It proved &s;o &s;evere.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The mother with her children then</L>
<L>Was pierced to the heart;</L>
<L>To think a friend &s;o near and dear,</L>
<L>And they &s;o &s;oon mu&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</L>

<L>And then upon his knees was rai&s;'d,</L>
<L>As was by people &s;aid</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And then he lift his &s;oul on high,</L>
<L>By a mo&s;t fervent prayer;</L>
<L>Which did amaze the &s;tanders by,</L>
<L>To hear a voice &s;o clear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From one &s;o near depriv'd of breath,</L>
<L>As did to them appear;</L>
<L>When done he gently laid him down,</L>
<L>And little more was hear'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What tongue is hear that can de&s;cribe,</L>
<L>The melancholy &s;cene;</L>
<L>The near approach of their di&s;tre&s;s</L>
<L>Of &s;orrow, grief and pain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But when on earth his work was done,</L>
<L>He yielded up his breath;</L>
<L>With peaceful mind and will re&s;ign'd,</L>
<L>Into the arms of death.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He's gone we tru&s;t to worlds on high,</L>
<L>Where &s;in and &s;orrow cea&s;e;</L>
<L>And left this tire&s;ome weary life,</L>
<L>For everla&s;ting peace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And left to us this tire&s;ome road&punc;</L>
<L>Where trouble leads the way;</L>
<L>In Abram's bo&s;om for to re&s;t,</L>
<L>Till the great judgement day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To you that are the &s;ufferers,</L>
<L>That here on earth remain;</L>
<L>Remember well your Elder dear,</L>
<L>Who for you &s;par'd no pains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No more can he your Shepherd be,</L>
<L>When troubles do ari&s;e;</L>
<L>For in the grave his body's laid,</L>
<L>And death has clo&s;'d his eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He in the great Jehovah's name,</L>
<L>Did lovingly invite;</L>
<L>His brethren and followers,</L>
<L>With him for to unite.</L>

<L>Never for to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">ake.</L>
