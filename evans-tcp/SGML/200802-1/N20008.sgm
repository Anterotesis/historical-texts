<OPENER><SALUTE>Kind Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HOW many people have fallen in the city of Philadelphia, by the <HI>pe&s;tilential Infection,</HI> is unknown to the Author&mdash;and he believes to the inhabitants of the &s;ame place; for the accounts are very different, as &s;ome mention four, others five, &s;ix, and even more than &s;even thou&s;and: and the latter has been &s;uppo&s;ed to be not too large.&mdash;Some have given the <HI>di&s;order</HI> one name, and others another, &amp;c. It has been called a <HI>genuine Plague;</HI>&mdash;a <HI>putrid malignant Fever;</HI>&mdash;a <HI>yellow Fe|ver,</HI> and a <HI>pe&s;tilential Infection.</HI> It &s;eems that the <HI>mor|tality</HI> began about the beginning of Augu&s;t, and raged with great violence till the weather grew colder.</P>
<P>THE Author has compo&s;ed the following lines at his lei&s;ure hours, in which he has given a true de&s;cription of the terrible effects of this contagion, according to the be&s;t information he has been able to obtain from recent publications; and as many people have called it a <HI>Plague,</HI> and as he knows not its proper name, he hopes he &s;hall be excu&s;ed for calling it &s;o in the &s;ub&s;equent pages.&mdash;From, kind Reader, your's and the public's mo&s;t obe|dient humble &s;ervant,</P>

<HEAD>POETICAL LINES, On the DESTRUCTION of the Citizens of Phi|ladelphia, by a pe&s;tilential Infection, A. D. 1793.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>FROM Philadelphia comes a doleful &s;ound,</L>
<L>Of thou&s;ands &s;lain, and buried in the ground!</L>
<L>Who were alive and well three months ago;</L>
<L>But of their fate at that time did not know.</L>
<L>The young, the old, tho&s;e of a middle age,</L>
<L>With rapid force, have been &s;wept from the &s;tage!</L>
<L>By an infection, which &s;ome people &s;ay</L>
<L>From di&s;tant lands, &s;omehow, has found the way:</L>
<L>But &s;ome with boldne&s;s do this thing deny,</L>
<L>And &s;ay the <HI>venom</HI> from the earth did fly;</L>
<L>From <HI>filth</HI> expanded by <HI>Sol'</HI>s burning heat,</L>
<L>Or <HI>fumes</HI> proceeding from a dirty &s;treet;</L>
<L>Thus generated, did infect the air</L>
<L>With putrid exhalations ev'ry where,</L>
<L>Within the limits of the city's bound;</L>
<L>But not in places which the &s;ame &s;urround.</L>
<L>In Water-&s;treet this <HI>mortal Plague</HI> began,</L>
<L>And with great &s;laughter through the city ran;</L>
<L>From hou&s;e to hou&s;e the dread contagion flew,</L>
<L>And on its way a num'rous train hath &s;lew!</L>
<L>In diff'rent ways the exhalations &s;trike,</L>
<L>And all the patients are not &s;eiz'd alike;</L>
<L>Their con&s;titutions diff'ring much likewi&s;e,</L>
<L>Make &s;ymptoms too of diff'rent kinds ari&s;e.</L>
<L>Some who were &s;eiz'd, had on the fir&s;t attack</L>
<L>Cold chills, and pains, both in the head and back,</L>
<L>And in their limbs, and al&s;o in their bones,</L>
<L>Exciting horror, gloom, and di&s;mal groans!</L>
<L>Within the &s;tomach humours did convene,</L>
<L>And vomiting did often &s;upervene;</L>
<L>The bile was black, and putrid too indeed,</L>
<L>And haemorrhages &s;ometimes did &s;ucceed;</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="026206_0004_0FD02C4B78E27830">
The pul&s;e run high, but often very low.</L>
<L>Sometimes too quick, and then as much too &s;low;</L>
<L>The eyes grew red, their pupils did dilate;</L>
<L>The fluids ru&s;h'd into a putrid &s;tate;</L>
<L>The thir&s;t was great, the urine colour'd high;</L>
<L>The tongue turn'd white, the &s;kin was hot and dry.</L>
<L>The dang'rous fever often did remit;</L>
<L>And was &s;ucceeded by an ague fit.</L>
<L>Sometimes eruptions ro&s;e upon the &s;kin,</L>
<L>Exceeding thick on &s;ome, on others thin.</L>
<L>Among&s;t great numbers of the human race,</L>
<L>The putrefaction did gain ground apace:</L>
<L>Its raging force at la&s;t became &s;o keen,</L>
<L>That <HI>death</HI> &s;tept in, and clos'd the awful <HI>&s;cene!</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>About this <HI>Plague</HI> phy&s;icians di&s;agree,</L>
<L>And other men, who from its <HI>virus</HI> flee:</L>
<L>Great numbers who have &s;een its raging flames,</L>
<L>By promulgation gave it diff'rent names,</L>
<L>Some &s;ay it is the <HI>pe&s;tilence,</HI> indeed,</L>
<L>Which from a foreign country did proceed.</L>
<L>Another name few men of &s;kill do find,</L>
<L>Call it a fever of &s;ome <HI>yellow</HI> kind;</L>
<L>Think it aro&s;e, as we do under&s;tand,</L>
<L>By <HI>exhalations</HI> from the filthy land.</L>
<L>We are inform'd, that no man can deny,</L>
<L>That &s;ome knew not what med'cines to apply</L>
<L>For this <HI>di&s;ea&s;e,</HI> which ne'er was <HI>known</HI> before</L>
<L>To make an entrance on our &s;olid &s;hore!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The celebrated Doctor <HI>Ru&s;h</HI> did find,</L>
<L>That <HI>calomel,</HI> with <HI>jalap</HI> well combin'd,</L>
<L>Was the be&s;t <HI>purge,</HI> by far, that could be giv'n</L>
<L>By any <HI>medica&s;ter</HI> under heav'n,</L>
<L><HI>Phlebotomy</HI> he highly recommends</L>
<L>To all <HI>phy&s;icians,</HI> and to other <HI>friends.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Evacuations</HI> of the&s;e kinds repre&s;s'd</L>
<L>The raging <HI>Plague,</HI> and thus &s;av'd the di&s;tre&s;s'd:</L>
<L>But <HI>anti&s;eptics</HI> often were employ'd;</L>
<L>Till putrefaction was thereby de&s;troy'd.</L>
<L>For my own part, I do applaud his <HI>plan,</HI></L>
<L>And, with e&s;teem, call him a <HI>&s;kilful man.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From his <HI>infection</HI> but few have been free,</L>
<L>But few exempt, of high or low degree,</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="026206_0005_0FD02C556A1ED640">
Unle&s;s they have from the great city fled,</L>
<L>Before the <HI>virus</HI> o'er the &s;ame was &s;pread;</L>
<L>Or have not been in that large place at all,</L>
<L>In Augu&s;t la&s;t, or any time this fall.</L>
<L>Some people <HI>fell,</HI> 'tis &s;aid, on the fir&s;t day!</L>
<L>Though &s;ome liv'd longer, yet were &s;wept away!</L>
<L>Sometimes an hundred in one day, 'tis &s;aid,</L>
<L>And often more, have in their graves been laid!</L>
<L>Some thou&s;ands by the putrefaction fell!</L>
<L>But &s;ome by chance have of the <HI>Plague</HI> got well.</L>
<L>The air <HI>corrupt,</HI> made people then believe</L>
<L>'Twas dang'rous for them in the &s;ame to breathe!</L>
<L>Hence many <HI>fled</HI> to keep off from its force,</L>
<L>And &s;ettled in the country towns of cour&s;e;</L>
<L>The &s;hops were &s;hut, and bu&s;ine&s;s at a &s;tand;</L>
<L>The Plague, 'twas thought, would de&s;olate the land!</L>
<L>The people, pent as in a lone&s;ome den,</L>
<L>Sell not their goods unto their countrymen;</L>

<L>For want of hands the num'rous goods to &s;tore;</L>
<L>The &s;weeping <HI>illne&s;s,</HI> by its rapid &s;ail,</L>
<L>Did cau&s;e the markets in the town to fail!</L>
<L>For in the city ev'ry one did know,</L>
<L>The country people were afraid to go,</L>
<L>Le&s;t the <HI>contagion</HI> they might thus convey,</L>
<L>Lo&s;e their own <HI>lives,</HI> and fill men with <HI>di&s;may!</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Perhaps, by writing, no man can expre&s;s</L>
<L>What people &s;uffer'd in this great di&s;tre&s;s!</L>
<L>For want of <HI>food,</HI> &s;ome very hand did fare,</L>
<L>Some dy'd, no doubt, for want of <HI>proper care!</HI></L>
<L>Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed objects on their beds did lie;</L>
<L>The want of help produc'd a di&s;mal cry!</L>
<L>Their friends gone off, and their kind neighbours fled,</L>
<L>That they might not be number'd with the dead!</L>
<L>Whil&s;t <HI>death</HI> and <HI>horror</HI> &s;pread them&s;elves around,</L>
<L>Young <HI>children</HI> were by their <HI>dead</HI> mothers found!</L>
<L>A &s;hocking &s;ight, indeed, for to behold!</L>
<L>Made the <HI>&s;pectator'</HI>s very <HI>blood</HI> run cold!</L>

<L>Can't tell their names&mdash;&s;ome are not known at all!</L>
<L>The &s;ad <HI>de&s;truction</HI> made the people groan!</L>
<L>Bereav'd of wives, &s;ome Hu&s;bands live alone!</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="026206_0006_0FCF57F045DFF7A0">
The widows too (it cannot be deny'd)</L>
<L>By this <HI>infection</HI> have been multiply'd.</L>
<L>The fatherle&s;s and orphans did increa&s;e,</L>
<L>Until the time the dreadful Plague did cea&s;e,</L>
<L>Which did commence, as we've been often told,</L>
<L>Upon the revolution of the cold;</L>
<L>Which &s;oon <HI>condens'd</HI> the &s;tagnant atmo&s;phere,</L>
