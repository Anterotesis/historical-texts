Narration of what God had done and was then doing; but likewi&s;e as a Prophetick indigita|tion of what God has ever &s;ince been, is &s;till doing, and will do in behalt of his Church &amp; cho&s;en People even to the end of the World. For Jeru&s;alem not only in David and Solo|mon's days and during the time that the fir&s;t Temple was &s;tanding, but after the Rebuild|ing of it, was the cho&s;en Place of the &s;tated and &s;olemn Wor&s;hip of the true God: For the Lord had <HI>cho&s;en Zion, he de&s;ired it for his habita|tion</HI>; and <HI>loved the gates of</HI> that Mountain more than <HI>all the dwellings of Jacob.</HI> Thither King David had brought <HI>up the Ark of the Covenant</HI> and had there fix'd its <HI>re&s;ting Place</HI>; even in this City of David, in who&s;e Palaces <HI>God was Known for a Refuge:</HI> The hou&s;e of God was there, and thither the Tribes went up, <HI>the Tribes of the Lord unto the te&s;timony of I&s;rael,</HI> to give thanks unto the Name of the Lord. And there al&s;o were <HI>&s;et Thrones of Judgement,</HI> the <HI>Thrones which appertain'd to the hou&s;e of David.</HI> It was now the Sent of God's Publick Wor|&s;hip &amp; Ordinances, and &s;o an eminent Type and Figure of his univer&s;al Church for ever|more. It was <HI>a City that was compact together,</HI> and &s;o a lively and lovely Emblem of the Churches Unity &amp; Happine&s;s, and the flou|ri&s;hing State of Religion in all after times; pointing us to that <HI>Jeru&s;alem which is above,</HI>

or rather from above, <HI>is free and is the Mother of us all</HI>: By which is meant the Go&s;pel Church, &s;omtimes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>the heavenly Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and <HI>the new Jeru&s;alem coming down from God out of hea|ven as a Bride adorned for her Husband.</HI>&mdash;As the Literal Jeru&s;alem was a Type of the Spi|ritual, &s;o the Rebuilding of the former was a Type of the Reviving and Edification of the latter.</P>
<P>And if we run over the Annals of the Church and ob&s;erve the &s;everal Periods wherein God has remembred it in, and rais'd it up from, its low E&s;tate; we &s;hall find that it bears no little Re&s;emblance to Jeru&s;alem in the fall and ri&s;e thereof, which our Text nextly refers to.</P>
<P>Now then, by the <HI>Lord's Building up Jeru&s;a|lem,</HI> we may under&s;tand in general, no only his Rearing up the Church of I&s;rael and making them the Subjects of many peculiar and di&s;tin|gui&s;hing Priviledges &amp; Immunities; Ble&s;&s;ings both of a Spiritual and Temporal nature and reference, but likewi&s;e all that he has done, is now doing and may do hereafter in Building up the Chri&s;tian Church; all that any way contributes to the furtherance of the Welfare and Happine&s;s of his People in Go&s;pel Days.</P>

In a re&s;embling manner there is (at lea&s;t there ought to be) Unity, Unifor|mity, Peace and Harmony maintained &amp; cul|tivated among Chri&s;tians. <HI>That they all may be one,</HI> agreeable to our Saviour's Prayer, and to the in&s;pired Apo&s;tle's de&s;cription of the Church, <HI>Fpb</HI> 4.1,&mdash;6 <HI>&amp;</HI> 12,&mdash;16.

3, 11. The Church is built on the Founda|tion of the Apo&s;tles &amp; Prophets, Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf being the chief Corner-&s;tone. This is the Lord's doing and it is marvellous in our Eyes.

thou ha&s;t &s;cattered us; thou hast made the Land to tremble, thou ha&s;t broken it: heal the breaches, for it &s;haketh. Where is thy Zeal, O Lord, and thy Strength, the &s;ounding of thy Bowels &amp; thy Mercies, are they Re&s;trained</HI>?</P>
<P><HI>To Conclude,</HI> Let all that now hear me be per|&s;waded to unite your Strength and do all You can in your re&s;pective Places and according to your &s;everal &amp; different Talents, Abilities and Oppurtunities, to <HI>further the Building up of Je|ru&s;alem.</HI> As to the greater part of this Nume|rous A&s;&s;embly, I never expect to &s;ee Your faces more, till we hear the Sound of the la&s;t Trum|pet, and all appear before the Judgment-&s;eat of Chri&s;t.

<P><HI>Further,</HI> I be&s;eech you, Brethren, <HI>Mark them which cau&s;e Divi&s;ions &amp; Offences, contrary to the Doctrine which ye have learned, and avoid them: For they that are &s;uch &s;erve not our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, but their own Belly; and by good words and fair &s;peaches deceive the hearts of the &s;imple.</HI> The fruit of the Spirit is Love, Peace, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This is the Wi&s;dom that is from above. The Kingdom of God is not Meat &amp; Drink, but Righteou&s;ne&s;s &amp; Peace; for he that in the&s;e things &s;erveth Chri&s;t, is acceptable to God &amp; approv'd of men. Where as divi&s;ive, &s;eparating Principles &amp; Practi&s;es are Condemn'd in Scripture as Works of the Fle&s;h, and an Argument of a Carnal Mind.

For while one &s;aith, I am of Paul, and another I am of Apollos, are ye not Carnal</HI>? See al&s;o <HI>Jam.</HI> 3 14, 16. A Church-rending, Unpeaceable, Party Spirit, is certainly a bid Spirit.

The&s;e are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lu&s;ts, and their mouth &s;peaking great &s;welling words of vanity, having mens per&s;ons in ad|miration becau&s;e of advantage. But beloved, re|member the words which were &s;poken before of the Apo&s;tles of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, how that they told you that there &s;hould be meckers in the la&s;t time, who &s;hould walk after their own ungodly lu&s;ts: The&s;e be they who &s;eparate them&s;elves, &s;en&s;ual, having not the Spirit. But ye beloved, builing up your &s;elves on your mo&s;t holy Faith, Praying in the Holy Gho&s;t, Keep your &s;elves in the Love of God. Looking for the Mercy of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t unto Eternal Life. Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to pre&s;ent you faultle&s;s before the Pre&s;ence of his glory with exceeding Joy. To the Only Wi&s;e God our Saviour, be Glory and Maje&s;ty, Dominion and Power, both now and ever.</HI> AMEN.</P>
