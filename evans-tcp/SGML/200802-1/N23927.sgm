<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE writing travels, or memoirs, has ever been a plea&s;ant employment, for va|nity or &s;en&s;ibility always renders it intere&s;t|ing. In writing the&s;e de&s;ultory letters, I found I could not avoid, being continually the fir&s;t per&s;on&mdash;"the little hero of each tale." I tried to correct this fault, if it be one, for they were de&s;igned for publication; but in pro|portion as I arranged my thoughts, my let|ter. I found, became &s;tiff and affected: I, therefore, determined to let my remarks and reflections flow unre&s;trained, as I per|ceived that I could not give a ju&s;t de&s;crip|tion of what I &s;aw, but by relating the effect different objects had produced on my mind and feelings, whil&s;t the impre&s;&s;ion was &s;till fre&s;h.</P>
<P>A per&s;on has a right, I have &s;ometimes thought, when amu&s;ed by a witty or intere&s;t|ing egoti&s;t, to talk of him&s;elf when he can win on our attention by acquiring our affection. Whether I de&s;erve to rank among&s;t this privi|leged number, my readers alone can judge&mdash; and I give them leave to &s;hut the book, if they do not wi&s;h to become better acquainted with me.</P>
<P>My plan was &s;imply to endeavour to give a ju&s;t view of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the countries I have pa&s;&s;ed through, as far as I could obtain
<PB REF="031653_0003_0fed8de453bb4500">
information during &s;o &s;hort a re&s;idence; avoid|ing tho&s;e details which, without being very u&s;eful to travellers who follow the &s;ame route, appear very in&s;iped to tho&s;e who only accom|pany you in their chair.</P>

<HEAD>LETTERS WRITTEN DURING A SHORT RESIDENCE IN SWEDEN, NORWAY, AND DENMARK.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<P>ELEVEN days of wearine&s;s on board a ve&s;&s;el not intended for the accommodati|on of pa&s;&s;engers have &s;o exhau&s;ted my &s;pirits, to &s;ay nothing of the other cau&s;es, with which you are already &s;ufficiently acquainted, that it is with &s;ome difficulty I adhere to my determin|ation of giving you my ob&s;ervations, as I travel through new &s;cenes, whi&s;t warmed with the impre&s;&s;ion they have made on me.</P>
<P>The captain, as I mentioned to you, promi&s;|ed to put me on &s;hore at Arendall<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Norway,</NOTE>, or Goth|enburg, in his way to El&s;ineur; but contrary winds obliged us to pa&s;s both places during the night. In the morning, however, after we had lo&s;t &s;ight of the entrance of the latter bay, the ve&s;&s;el was becalmed; and the captain, to oblige me, hanging out a &s;ignal for a pilot, bore down towards the &s;hore.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="031653_0005_0fed8ded37e33870">My attention was particularly directed to the light-hou&s;e; and you can &s;carcely imagine with what anxiety I watched two long hours for a boat to emancipate me&mdash;&s;till no one appeared. Every cloud that flitted on the horizon was hailed as a liberator, till approaching nearer, like mo&s;t of the pro&s;pects &s;ketched by hope, it di&s;&s;olved under the eye into di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>Weary of expectation, I then began to con|ver&s;e with the captain on the &s;ubject; and, from the tenour of the information my que&s;ti|ons drew forth, I &s;oon concluded, that, if I waited for a boat, I had little chance of getting on &s;hore at this place. De&s;poti&s;m, as is u&s;ual|ly the ca&s;e, I found had here cramped the in|du&s;try of man. The pilots being paid by the king, and &s;cantily, they will not run into any danger, or even quit their hovels, if they can po&s;&s;ibly avoid it, only to fulfil what is termed their duty. How different is it on the engli&s;h coa&s;t, where, in the mo&s;t &s;tormy weather, boats immediately hail you, brought out by the expectation of extraordinary profit. Di&s;lik|ing to &s;ail for El&s;ineur, and &s;till more to lie at anchor, or crui&s;e about the coa&s;t for &s;everal days, I exerted all my rhetoric to prevail on the captain to let me have the &s;hip's boat; and though I added the mo&s;t forcible of ar|guments, I for a long time addre&s;&s;ed him in vain.</P>
<P>It is a kind of rule at &s;ea, not to &s;end out a boat. The captain was a good-natured man; but men with common minds &s;eldom break
<PB N="7" REF="031653_0006_0fed8deedb0484e8">
through general rules. Prudence is ever the re&s;ort of weakne&s;s; and they rarely go as far as they may in any undertaking, who are de|termined not to go beyond it on any account If, however, I had &s;ome trouble with the cap|tain, I did not lo&s;e much time with the &s;ailors; for they, all alacrity, hoi&s;ted out the boat, the moment I obtained permi&s;&s;ion, and promi&s;ed to row me to the light-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I did not once allow my&s;elf to doubt of ob|taining a conveyance from thence round the rocks&mdash;and then away for Gothenburg&mdash;con|finement is &s;o unplea&s;ant.</P>
<P>The day was fine; and I enjoyed the water till, approaching the little i&s;land, poor Mar|guerite, who&s;e timidity always acts as a feeler before her adventuring &s;pirit, began to won|der at our not &s;eeing any inhabitants. I did not li&s;ten to her. But when, on landing, the &s;ame &s;ilence prevailed, I caught the alarm, which was not le&s;&s;ened by the &s;ight of two old men, whom we forced out of their wretched hut. Scarcely human in their appearance, we with difficulty obtained an intelligible reply to our que&s;tions&mdash;the re&s;ult of which was, that they had no boat, and were not allowed to quit their po&s;t, on any pretence. But, they informed us, that there was at the other &s;ide, eight or ten miles over, a pilot's dwelling; two guineas tempted the &s;ailors to ri&s;k the captain's di&s;plea&s;ure, and once more embark to row me over.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="031653_0007_0fed8df078d898d8">The weather was plea&s;ant, and the appear|ance of the &s;hore &s;o grand, that I &s;hould have enjoyed the two hours it took to reach it, but for the fatigue which was too vi&s;ible in the countenances of the &s;ailors who, in&s;tead of ut|tering a complaint, were, with the thought|le&s;s hilarity peculiar to them, joking about the po&s;&s;ibility of the captain's taking advantage of a &s;light we&s;terly breeze, which was &s;pringing up, to &s;ail without them. Yet, in &s;pite of their good humour, I could not help growing unea|&s;y when the &s;hore, receding, as it were, as we advanced, &s;eemed to promi&s;e no end to their toil. This anxiety increa&s;ed when, turning into the mo&s;t picture&s;que bay I ever &s;aw, my eyes &s;ought in vain for the ve&s;tige of a human habitation. Before I could determine what &s;tep to take in &s;uch a dilemma, for I could not bear to think of returning to the &s;hip, the &s;ight of a barge relieved me, and we ha&s;tened towards it for information. We were immediately di|rected to pa&s;s &s;ome jutting rocks when we &s;hould &s;ee a pilot's hut.</P>
<P>There was a &s;olemn &s;ilence in this &s;cene, which made it&s;elf be felt. The &s;un-beams that played on the ocean, &s;carcely ruffled by the lighte&s;t breeze, contra&s;ted with the huge, dark rocks, that looked like the rude materials of creation forming the barrier of unwrought &s;pace, forcibly &s;truck me; but I &s;hould not have been &s;orry if the cottage had not appeared equally tranquil. Approaching a retreat where &s;trangers, e&s;pecially women, &s;o &s;eldom appeared, I wondered that curio&s;ity did not
<PB N="9" REF="031653_0008_0fed8df7d587fe50">
bring the beings who inhabited it to the win|dows or door. I did not immediately recollect that men who remain &s;o near the brute creati|on, as only to exert them&s;elves to find the food nece&s;&s;ary to &s;u&s;tain life, have little or no imagination to call forth the curio&s;ity nece&s;&s;ary to fructify the faint glimmerings of mind which entitles them to rank as lords of the creation.&mdash; Had they either, they could not contentedly re|main rooted in the clods they &s;o indolently cul|tivate.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the &s;ailors went to &s;eek for the &s;lug|gi&s;h inhabitants, the&s;e conclu&s;ions, occurr|ed to me; and, recollecting the extreme fondne&s;s which the pari&s;ians ever te&s;tify for novelty, their very curio&s;ity appeared to me a proof of the progre&s;s they had made in refinement. Yes; in the art of living&mdash;in the art of e&s;caping from the cares which embarra&s;s the fir&s;t &s;teps towards the attainment of the plea&s;ures of &s;ocial life.</P>
<P>The pilots informed the &s;ailors that they were under the direction of a lieutenant retired from the &s;ervice, who &s;poke engli&s;h; adding, that they could do nothing without his orders; and even the offer of money could hardly con|quer their lazine&s;s, and prevail on them to ac|company us to his dwelling. They would not go with me alone which I wanted them to have done, becau&s;e I wi&s;hed to di&s;mi&s;s the &s;ailors as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. Once more we rowed off, they following tardily, till, turning round another bold protuberance of the rocks, we &s;aw
<PB N="10" REF="031653_0009_0fed8dfc82179948">
a boat making towards us, and &s;oon learnt that it was the lieutenant him&s;elf, coming with &s;ome earne&s;tne&s;s to &s;ee who we were.</P>
<P>To &s;ave the &s;ailors any further toil, I had my baggage in&s;tantly removed into his boat; for, as he could &s;peak engli&s;h, a previous par|ley was not nece&s;&s;ary; though Marguerite's re&s;pect for me could hardly keep her from ex|pre&s;&s;ing the fear, &s;trongly marked on her coun|tenance, which my putting our&s;elves into the power of a &s;trange man excited. He pointed out his cottage; and, drawing near to it, I was not &s;orry to &s;ee a female figure, though I had not, like Marguerite, been thinking of robberies, murders, or the other evil which in&s;tantly, as the &s;ailors would have &s;aid, runs foul of a woman's imagination.</P>
<P>On entering, I was &s;till better plea&s;ed to find a clean hou&s;e, with &s;ome degree of rural elegance. The beds were of mu&s;lin, coar&s;e it is true, but dazzlingly white; and the floor was &s;trewed over with little &s;prigs of Juniper (the cu&s;tom, as I afterwards found, of the coun|try), which formed a contra&s;t with the curtains and produced an agreeable &s;en&s;ation of fre&s;hne&s;s, to &s;often the ardour of noon. Still nothing was &s;o plea&s;ing as the alacrity of ho&s;pitality&mdash; all that the hou&s;e afforded was quickly &s;pread on the white&s;t linen.&mdash;Remember I had ju&s;t left the ve&s;&s;el, where, without being fa&s;tidious, I had continually been di&s;gu&s;ted. Fi&s;h, milk, butter, and chee&s;e, and I am &s;orry to add, brandy, the bane of this country, were &s;pread
<PB N="11" REF="031653_0010_0fed8e025bae8c40">
on the board. After we had dined, ho&s;pitality made them, with &s;ome degree of my&s;tery, bring us &s;ome excellent coffee. I did not then know that it was prohibited.</P>
<P>The good man of the hou&s;e apologized for coming in continually, but declared that he was &s;o glad to &s;peak engli&s;h, he could not &s;tay out, He need not have apologized; I was e|qually glad of his company. With the wife I could only exchange &s;miles; and &s;he was em|ployed ob&s;erving the make of our clothes. My hands, I found, had fir&s;t led her to di&s;cover that I was the lady. I had, of cour&s;e, my quantum of reverences; for the politene&s;s of the north &s;eems to partake of the coldne&s;s of the climate, and the rigidity of its iron &s;inew|ed rocks. Among&s;t the pea&s;antry, there is, however, &s;o much of the &s;implicity of the golden age in this land of flint&mdash;&s;o much over|flowing of heart, and fellow-feeling, that only benevolence, and the hone&s;t &s;ympathy of na|ture, diffu&s;ed &s;miles over my countenance when they kept me &s;tanding, regardle&s;s of my fa|tigue, whil&s;t they dropt courte&s;y after cour|te&s;y.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of this hou&s;e was beautiful, though cho&s;en for convenience. The ma&s;ter being the officer who commanded all the pilots on the coa&s;t, and the per&s;on apointed to guard wrecks, it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to fix on a &s;pot that would overlook the whole bay. As he had &s;een &s;ome &s;ervice, he wore, not without a pride I thought becoming, a badge to prove
<PB N="12" REF="031653_0011_0fed8e03f8e63920">
that he had merited well of his country. It was happy, I thought, that he had been paid in honour; for the &s;tipend he received was lit|tle more than twelve pounds a year.&mdash;I do not trouble my&s;elf or you with the calculation of &s;wedi&s;h ducats. Thus, my friend, you per|ceive the nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>perqui&s;ites.</HI> This &s;ame narrow policy runs through every thing. I &s;hall have occa&s;ion further to animadvert in it.</P>
<P>Though my ho&s;t amu&s;ed me with an account of him&s;elf, which gave me an idea of the man|ners of the people I was about to vi&s;it, I was eager to climb the rocks to view the country, and &s;ee whether the hone&s;t tars had regained their &s;hip. With the help of the lieutenant's tele&s;cope I &s;aw the ve&s;&s;el underway with a fair though gentle gale. The &s;ea was calm, play|ful even as the mo&s;t &s;hallow &s;tream, and on the va&s;t ba&s;on I did not &s;ee a dark &s;peck to indicate the boat. My conductors were con&s;equently arrived.</P>
<P>Straying further, my eye was attracted by the &s;ight of &s;ome heart's-ea&s;e that peeped through the rocks. I caught at it as a good omen, and going to pre&s;erve it in a letter that had not conveyed balm to my heart, a cruel remembrance &s;uffu&s;ed my eyes; but it pa&s;&s;ed away like an April &s;hower. If you are deep read in Shak&s;peare, you will recollect that this was the little we&s;tern flower tinged by love's dart, which "maidens call love in idle|ne&s;s." The gaiety of my babe was unmixed;
<PB N="13" REF="031653_0012_0fed8e059b241ad8">
regardle&s;s of omens or &s;entiments, &s;he found a few wild &s;trawberries more grateful than flow|ers or fancies.</P>
<P>The lieutenant informed me that this was a commodious bay. Of that I could not judge, though I felt its picture&s;que beauty. Rocks were piled on rocks, forming a &s;uitable bulwark to the ocean. Come no further, they empha|tically &s;aid, turning their dark &s;ides to the waves to augment the idle roar. The view was &s;terile; &s;till little patches of earth, of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite verdure, enamelled with the &s;weete&s;t wild flowers, &s;eemed to promi&s;e the goats and a few &s;traggling cows luxurious her|bage. How &s;ilent and peaceful was the &s;cene. I gazed around with rapture, and felt more of that &s;pontaneous plea&s;ure which gives credebil|ity to our expectation of happine&s;s, than I had for a long, long time before. I forgot the horrors I had witne&s;&s;ed in France, which had ca&s;t a gloom over all native, and &s;uffering the enthu&s;ia&s;m of my character, too often, graci|ous God! damped by the tears of di&s;appointed affection, to be lighted up afre&s;h, care took wing while &s;imple fellow feeling expanded my heart.</P>
<P>To prolong this enjoyment, I readily a&s;|&s;ented to the propo&s;al of our ho&s;t to pay a vi&s;it to a family, the ma&s;ter of which &s;poke engli&s;h, who was the drolle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t dog in the country, he added, repeating &s;ome of his &s;tories, with a hearty laugh.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="031653_0013_0fed8e0a26828158">I walked on, &s;till delighted with the rude beauties of the &s;cene! for the &s;ublime often gave place imperceptibly to the beautiful, dilating the emotions which were painfully concentrat|ed.</P>
<P>When we entered this abode, the large&s;t I had yet &s;een, I was introduced to a numerous family; but the father, from whom I was led to expect &s;o much entertainment, was ab&s;ent. The lieutenant con&s;equently was obliged to be the interpreter of our reciprocal compliments. The phra&s;es were awkwardly tran&s;mitted, it is true; but looks and ge&s;tures were &s;ufficient to make them intelligible and intere&s;ting. The girls were all vivacity, and re&s;pect for me could &s;carcely keep them from romping with my ho&s;t, who, a&s;king for a pinch of &s;nuff, was pre&s;ented with a box, out of which an artificial mou&s;e, fa&s;tened to the bottom, &s;prung. Though this trick had doubtle&s;s been played time out of mind, yet the laughter it excited was not le&s;s genuine.</P>
<P>They were overflowing with civility; but to prevent their almo&s;t killing my babe with kindne&s;s, I was obliged to &s;horten my vi&s;it; and two or three of the girls accompanied us, bringing with them a part of whatever the hou&s;e afforded to contribute towards rendering my &s;upper more plentiful; and plentiful in fact it was, though I with difficulty did honour to &s;ome of the di&s;hes, not reli&s;hing the quantity of &s;ugar and &s;pices put into every thing. At &s;upper my ho&s;t told me bluntly that I was a
<PB N="15" REF="031653_0014_0fed8e0d2ae47be8">
woman of ob&s;ervation, for I a&s;ked him <HI>men's que&s;tions.</HI></P>
<P>The arrangements for my journey were quickly made; I could only have a car with po&s;t-hor&s;es, as I did not chu&s;e to wait till a carriage could be &s;ent for to Gothenburg. The expen&s;e of my journey, about one or two and twenty engli&s;h miles, I found would not a|mount to more than eleven or twelve &s;hillings, paying, he a&s;&s;ured me, generou&s;ly. I gave him a guniea and a half. But it was with the greate&s;t difficulty that I could make him take &s;o much, indeed any thing for my lodging and fare. He declared that it was next to robbing me, explaining how much I ought to pay on the road. However, as I was po&s;itive, he took the guinea for him&s;elf; but, as a condition, in&s;i&s;ted on accompanying me, to prevent my meeting with any trouble or impo&s;ition on the way.</P>
<P>I then retired to my apartment with regret. The night was &s;o fine, that I would gladly have rambled about much longer; yet recol|lecting that I mu&s;t ri&s;e very early; I reluct|antly went to bed: but my &s;en&s;es had been &s;o awake, and my imagination &s;till continued &s;o bu&s;y, that I &s;ought for re&s;t in vain. Ri&s;ing before &s;ix, I &s;cented the &s;weet morning air; I had long before heard the birds twittering to hail the dawning day, though it could &s;carcely have been allowed to have departed.</P>
<P>Nothing, in fact, can equal the beauty of
<PB N="16" REF="031653_0015_0fed8e1033339310">
the northern &s;ummer's evening and night; if night it may be called that only wants the glare of day, the full light, which frequently &s;eems &s;o impertinent; for I could write at mid|night very well without a candle. I contem|plated all nature at re&s;t; the rocks, even grown darker in their appearance, looked as if they partook of the general repo&s;e, and reclined more heavily on their foundation.&mdash;What, I exclaimed, is this active principle which keeps me &s;till awake?&mdash;Why fly my thoughts abroad when every thing around me appears at home? My child was &s;leeping with equal calmne&s;s&mdash; innocent and &s;weet as the clo&s;ing flowers.&mdash; Some recollections, attached to the idea of home, mingled with reflections re&s;pecting the &s;tate of &s;ociety I had been contemplating that evening, made a tear drop on the ro&s;y cheek I had ju&s;t killed; and emotions that trembled on the brink of extacy and agony gave a poig|nancy to my &s;en&s;ations, which made me feel more alive than u&s;ual.</P>
<P>What are the&s;e imperious &s;ympathies? How frequently has melancholy and even my&s;an|thropy taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of me, when the world has di&s;gu&s;ted me, and friends have proved un|kind. I have then con&s;idered my&s;elf as a par|ticle broken off from the grand ma&s;s of man|kind;&mdash;I was alone, till &s;ome involuntary &s;ympathetic emotion, like the attraction of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, made me feel that I was full a part of a mighty whole, from which I could not &s;ever my&s;elf&mdash;not, perhaps, for the reflection has been carried very far, by &s;napping the thread
<PB N="17" REF="031653_0016_0fed8e133a6c7f48">
of an exi&s;tance which lo&s;es its charms in propor|tion as the cruel experience of life &s;tops or poi|&s;ons the current of the heart. Futurity, what ha&s;t thou not to give to tho&s;e who know that there is &s;uch a thing as happine&s;s! I &s;peak not of philo&s;ophical contentment, though pain has afforded them the &s;tronge&s;t conviction of it.</P>
<P>After our coffee and milk, for the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e had been rou&s;ed long before us by her ho&s;pitality, my baggage was taken forward in a boat by my ho&s;t, becau&s;e the car could not &s;afely have been brought to the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The road at fir&s;t was very rocky and trou|ble&s;ome; but our driver was careful, and the hor&s;es accu&s;tomed to the frequent and &s;udden acclivities and de&s;cents! &s;o that not apprehend|ing any danger, I played with my girl, whom I would not leave to Marguerite's care, on ac|count of her timidity.</P>
<P>Stopping at a little inn to bait the hor&s;es, I &s;aw the fir&s;t countenance in Sweden that di&s;|plea&s;ed me, though the man was better dre&s;&s;ed than any one who had as yet fallen in my way. An altercation took place between him and my ho&s;t, the purport of which I could not gue&s;s, excepting that I was the occa&s;ion of it, be it what it would. The &s;equel was his leaving the hou&s;e angrily; and I was immediately in|formed that he was the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officer. The profe&s;&s;ional had indeed effaced the nation|al

<P>There are &s;everal rich commercial hou&s;es, &s;cotch, french, and &s;wedi&s;h; but the &s;cotch, I believe, have been the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful. The commerce and commi&s;&s;ion bu&s;ine&s;s with France &s;ince the war, has been very lucrative, and enriched the merchants, I am afraid, at the expence of the other inhabitants, by rai&s;ing the price of the nece&s;&s;aries of life.</P>
<P>As all the men of con&s;equence, I mean men of the large&s;t fortune, are merchants, their principal enjoyment is a relaxation from bu&s;i|ne&s;s at the table, which is &s;pread at, I think, too early an hour (between one and two) for men who have letters to write and accounts to &s;ettle after paying due re&s;pect to the bottle.

centre to rally round, e&s;pecially as &s;candal, the ze&s;t of more &s;elect parties, can only be whi&s;pered. As for politics, I have &s;eldom found it a &s;ubject of continual di&s;cu&s;&s;ion in a country town in any part of the world. The politics of the place being on a &s;maller &s;cale, &s;uits better with the &s;ize of their faculties; for, generally &s;peaking, the &s;phere of ob&s;ervation determines the extent of the mind.</P>
<P>The more I &s;ee of the world, the more I am convinced that civilization is a ble&s;&s;ing not &s;ufficiently e&s;timated by tho&s;e who have not traced its progre&s;s; for it not only refines our enjoyments, but produces a variety which ena|bles us to retain the primitive delicacy of our &s;en&s;ations. Without the aid of the imagination all the plea&s;ures of the &s;en&s;es mu&s;t &s;ink into gro&s;&s;ne&s;s, unle&s;s continual novelty &s;erve as a &s;ub&s;titute for the imagination, which being impo&s;&s;ible, it was to this wearine&s;s, I &s;uppo&s;e, that Solomon alluded when he declared that there was nothing new under the &s;un!&mdash;no|thing for the common &s;en&s;ations excited by the &s;en&s;es. Yet who will deny that the imaginati|on and under&s;tanding have made many, very many di&s;coveries &s;ince tho&s;e days, which only &s;eem harbingers of others &s;till more noble and beneficial. I never met with much imagination among&s;t people who had not acquired a habit. of reflection; and in that &s;tate of &s;ociety in which the judgment and ta&s;te are not called forth, and formed by the cultivation of the arts and &s;ciences, little of that delicacy of feel|ing and thinking is to be found characterized

by the word &s;entiment. The want of &s;cientific pur&s;uits perhaps accounts for the ho&s;pitality, as well as for the cordial reception which &s;trangers receive from the inhabitants of &s;mall towns.</P>
<P>Ho&s;pitality has, I think, been too much prai&s;ed by travellers as a proof of goodne&s;s of heart, when in my opinion indi&s;criminate ho&s;|pitality is rather a criterion by which you may form a tolerable e&s;timate of the indolence or va|cancy of a head; or, in other words, a fond|ne&s;s for &s;ocial plea&s;ures in which the mind not having its proportion of exerci&s;e, the bottle mu&s;t be pu&s;hed about.</P>
<P>The&s;e remarks are equally applicable to Dub|lin, the mo&s;t ho&s;pitable city I ever pa&s;&s;ed through. But I will try to confine my ob&s;er|vations more piticularly to Sweden.</P>
<P>It is true I have only had a glance over a &s;mall part of it; yet of its pre&s;ent &s;tate of manners and acquirements I think I have formed a di&s;|tinct idea, without having vi&s;ited the capital, where, in fact, le&s;s of a national character is to be found than in the remote parts of the coun|try.</P>
<P>The swedes pique them&s;elves on their polite|ne&s;s; but far from being the poli&s;h of a cultivat|ed mind, it con&s;i&s;ts merely of tire&s;ome forms and ceremonies.

The &s;ort of &s;uperiority which a fortune gives when there is no &s;uperiority of education, excepting what con&s;i&s;ts in the ob&s;ervance of &s;en&s;ele&s;s forms, has a contrary effect than what is intend|ed; &s;o that I could not help reckoning the pea|&s;antry the polite&s;t people of Sweden, who only aiming at plea&s;ing you, never think of being admired for their behaviour.</P>
<P>Their tables, like their compliments, &s;eem e|qually a caricature of the french. The di&s;hes are compo&s;ed, as well as theirs, of a variety of mixtures to de&s;troy the native ta&s;te of the food without being as reli&s;hing. Spicies and &s;ugar are put into every thing, even into the bread; and the only way I can account for their parti|ality to high-&s;ea&s;oned di&s;hes, is the con&s;tant u&s;e of &s;alted provi&s;ions. Nece&s;&s;ity obliges them to lay up a &s;tore of dried fi&s;h, and &s;alted meat, for the winter; and in &s;ummer, fre&s;h meat and fi&s;h ta&s;te in&s;ipid after them. To which may be added the con&s;tant u&s;e of &s;pirits. Every day, before dinner and &s;upper, even whil&s;t the di&s;h|es are cooling on the table, men and women re|pair to a &s;ide-table, and to obtain an appetite, eat bread and butter, chee&s;e, raw &s;almon, or anchovies, drinking a gla&s;s of brandy. Salt fi&s;h or meat then immediately follows, to give a further whet to the &s;tomach. As the dinner advances, pardon me for taking up a few mi|nutes to de&s;cribe what, alas! has detained me two or three hours on the &s;tretch, ob&s;erving, di&s;h after di&s;h is changed, in endle&s;s rotation,

<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<P>THE population of Sweden has been e&s;ti|mated from two millions and a half to three millions: a &s;mall number for &s;uch an im|men&s;e tract of country: of which only &s;o much is cultivated, and that in the &s;imple&s;t manner, as is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upply the nece&s;&s;a|ries of life; and near the &s;ea&s;hore, from whence herrings are ea&s;ily procured, there &s;carcely ap|pears a ve&s;tige of cultivation. The &s;cattered huts that &s;tand &s;hivering on the naked rocks, braving the pitile&s;s elements, are formed of logs of wood, rudely hewn; and &s;o little pains are taken with the craggy foundation, that no|thing like a path-way points out the door.</P>
<P>Gathered into him&s;elf by the cold, lowering his vi&s;age to avoid the cutting bla&s;t, is it &s;ur|pri&s;ing that the churli&s;h plea&s;ure of drinking drams takes place of &s;ocial enjoyments among&s;t the poor, e&s;pecially if we take into the account, that they mo&s;tly live on high-&s;ea&s;oned provi&s;i|ons and rye bread? Hard enough, you may imagine, as it is only baked once a year. The &s;ervants al&s;o, in mo&s;t families, eat this kind of bread, and have a different kind of food from their ma&s;ters, which, in &s;pite of all the argu|ments

I have heard to vindicate the cu&s;tom, appears to me a remnant of b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rbari&s;m.</P>
<P>In fact, the &s;ituation of the &s;ervants in eve|ry re&s;pect, particularly that of the women, &s;hews how far the &s;wedes are from having a ju&s;t conception of rational equality. They are not <HI>te-med</HI> &s;laves; yet a man may &s;trike a man with impunity becau&s;e he pays him wages; though the&s;e wages are &s;o low, that nece&s;&s;ity mu&s;t teach them to pilfer, whil&s;t &s;ervility ren|ders them fal&s;e and boori&s;h. Still the men &s;tand up for the dignity of man, by oppre&s;&s;ing the women. The mo&s;t menial, and even laborious offices, are therefore left to the&s;e poor drudges. Much of this I have &s;een. In the winter, I am told, they take the linen down to the river, to wa&s;h it in the cold water; and though their hands, cut by the ice are cracked and bleeding, the men, their fellow &s;ervants, will not di&s;grace their manhood by carrying a tub to lighten their burden.</P>
<P>You will not be &s;urpri&s;ed to hear that they do not wear &s;hoes or &s;tockings, when I inform you that their wages are &s;eldom more than twenty or thirty &s;hillings per annum. It is the cu&s;tom, I know, to give them a new year's gift, and a pre&s;ent at &s;ome other period; but can it all amount to a ju&s;t indemnity for their labour? The treatment of &s;ervants in mo&s;t countries, I grant, is very unju&s;t; and in En|gland, that boa&s;ted land of freedom, it is often extremely tyrannical. I have freq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ently, with indignation, heard gentlemen declare that they
<PB N="27" REF="031653_0026_0fed8e30b115f6b8">
would never allow a &s;ervant to an&s;wer them; and ladies of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility, who were continually exclaiming again&s;t the cruelty of the vulgar to the brute creation, have in my pre&s;ence forgot that their attendants had hu|man feelings, as well as forms. I do not know a more agreeable &s;ight than to &s;ee &s;ervants part of a family. By taking an intere&s;t, generally &s;peaking, in their concerns, you in&s;pire them with one for yours. We mu&s;t love our &s;er|vants, or we &s;hall never be &s;ufficiently atten|tive to their happine&s;s; and how can tho&s;e ma&s;|ters be attentive to their happine&s;s, who liv|ing above their fortunes, are more anxious to out&s;hine their neighbours than to allow their hou&s;hold the innocent enjoyments they earn.</P>
<P>It is, in fact, much more difficult for &s;er|vants who are tantalized by &s;eeing and prepar|ing the dainties of which they are not to par|take, to remain hone&s;t, than the poor, who&s;e thoughts are not led from their homely fare; &s;o that, though the &s;ervants here are common|ly thieves, you &s;eldom hear of hou&s;e-breaking, or robbery on the highway. The country is, perhaps, too thinly inhabited to produce many of that de&s;cription of thieves termed footpads, or highwaymen. They are u&s;ually the &s;pawn of great cities; the effect of the &s;purious de&s;ires generated by wealth, rather than the de&s;perate &s;truggles of poverty to e&s;cape from mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>The enjoyment of the pea&s;antry was drink|ing brandy and coffee, before the latter was prohibited, and the former not allowed, to be

<P>The taxes before the reign of Charles the twelfth were incon&s;iderable. Since then, the burden has continually been growing heavier, and the price of provi&s;ions has proportionably increa&s;ed; nay, the advantage-accruing from the exportation of corn to France, and rye to Germany, will probably produce a &s;carcity in both Sweden and Norway, &s;hould not a peace put a &s;top to it this autumn; for &s;peculations of various kinds have already almo&s;t doubled the price.</P>
<P>Such are the effects of war, that it &s;aps the vitals even of the neutral countries, who, ob|taining a &s;udden influx of wealth, appear to be rendered flouri&s;hing by the de&s;truction which ravages the haple&s;s nations who are &s;acrificed to the ambition of their governors. I &s;hall not, however, dwell on the vices, though they be of the mo&s;t contemptible and embruting ca&s;t, to which a &s;udden acce&s;&s;ion of fortune gives birth, becau&s;e I believe it may be delivered as an ax|iom that it is only in proportion to the indu&s;try nece&s;&s;ary to acquire wealth, that a nation is really benefited by it.</P>
<P>The prohibition of drinking coffee, under a penalty, and the encouragement given to public di&s;tilleries, tend to impoveri&s;h the poor, who are not affected by the &s;umptuary law;

<P>Be&s;ides, the french revolution has not only rendered all the crowned heads more cautious, but has &s;o decrea&s;ed every where (excepting among&s;t them&s;elves) a re&s;pect for nobility, that the pea&s;antry have not only lo&s;t their blind reverence for their &s;eigniors, but com|plain, in a manly &s;tyle, of oppre&s;&s;ions which before they did not think of denominating &s;uch, becau&s;e they were taught to con&s;ider them|&s;elves as a different order of beings. And, perhaps, the efforts which the ari&s;tocrats are making here, as well as in every other part of Europe, to &s;ecure their &s;way, will be the mo&s;t effectual mode of undermining it; taking into the calculating, that the king of Sweden, like mo&s;t of the potentates of Europe, has continu|ally been augmenting his power by encroach|ing on the privileges of the nobles.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="031653_0029_0fed8e3b8e93d3a8">The well-bred &s;wedes of the capital are formed on the ancient french model; and they in general &s;peak that language; for they have a knack at acquiring languages, with tolerable fluency.

<P>A &s;en&s;ible writer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Cooper's Account of America.</NOTE> has lately ob&s;erved. (I have not his work by me, therefore cannot quote his exact words) 'that the americans very wi&s;ely let the europeans make their books and fa&s;hions for them.' But I cannot coincide with him in this opinion. The reflection ne|ce&s;&s;ary to produce a certain number even of tolerable productions, augments, more than he is aware of, the ma&s;s of knowledge in the com|munity. De&s;ultory reading is commonly mere|ly a pa&s;time. But we mu&s;t have an object to refer our reflections to, or they will &s;eldom go below the &s;urface.

of little incidents which narrows the mind.

<P>I am, my friend, more and more convinced that a metropolis, or an abode ab&s;olutely &s;oli|tary, is the be&s;t calculated for the improvement of the heart, as well as the under&s;tanding; whether we de&s;ire to become acquainted with man, nature, or our&s;elves.

<P>I love the country; yet whenever I &s;ee a picture&s;que &s;ituation cho&s;en on which to erect a dwelling, I am always afraid of the im|provements.

<P>THE &s;everity of the long &s;wedi&s;h winter tends to render the people &s;luggi&s;h; for, though this &s;ea&s;on has its peculiar plea&s;ures, too much time is employed to guard again&s;t its inclemency. Still, as warm clothing is ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, the women &s;pin, and the men weave, and by the&s;e exertions get a fence to keep out the cold. I have rarely pa&s;&s;ed a knot of cottages without &s;eeing cloth laid out to bleach; and when I entered, always found the women &s;pinning or knitting.</P>
<P>A mi&s;taken tenderne&s;s, however, for their children, makes them, even in &s;ummer, load them with flannels; and, having a &s;ort of na|tural antipathy to cold water, the &s;qualid ap|pearance of the poor babes, not to &s;peak of the noxious &s;mell which flannel and rugs retain, &s;eems a reply to a que&s;tion I had often a&s;ked&mdash; Why I did not &s;ee more children in the vil|lages I pa&s;&s;ed through? Indeed the children appear to be nipt in the bud, having neither the graces nor charms of their age. And this, I am per&s;uaded, is much more owing to the ignorance of the mothers than to the rudene&s;s of the climate. Rendered feeble by the con|tinual per&s;piration they are kept in, whil&s;t

<P>The women of fortune here, as well as eve|ry where el&s;e, have nur&s;es to &s;uckle their chil|dren; and the total want of cha&s;tity in the lower cla&s;s of women frequently renders them very unfit for the tru&s;t.</P>
<P>You have &s;ometimes remarked to me the differenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the manners of the country girls in England and in America; attributing the re&s;erve of the former to the climate&mdash;to the ab&s;ence of genial &s;uns. But it mo&s;t be their &s;tars, not the zephyrs gently &s;tealing on their &s;en&s;es, which here lead frail women a&s;tray.&mdash; Who can look at the&s;e rocks, and allow the voluptuou&s;ne&s;s of nature to be an excute for gratifying the de&s;ires it in&s;pires? We mu&s;t, therefore, find &s;ome other cau&s;e be&s;ide vo|luptuou&s;ne&s;s, I believe, to account for the conduct of the &s;wedi&s;h and american country girls; for I am led to conclude, from all the ob&s;ervations I have made, that there is always a mixture of &s;entiment and imagination in voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, to which neither of them have much preten&s;ion.</P>
<P>The country girls of Ireland and Wales equally feel the fir&s;t impul&s;e of nature, which, re&s;trained in England by fear or delicacy, proves that &s;ociety is there in a more advanced

&s;tate. Be&s;ides, as the mind is cultivated and ta&s;te gains ground, the pa&s;&s;ions become &s;trong|er, and re&s;t on &s;omething more &s;table than the ca&s;ual &s;ympathies of the moment. Health and idlene&s;s will always account for promi&s;cu|ous amours; and in &s;ome degree I term every per&s;on idle, the exerci&s;e of who&s;e mind does not bear &s;ome proportion to that of the bo|dy.</P>
<P>The &s;wedi&s;h ladies exerci&s;e neither &s;ufficient|ly; of cour&s;e, grow very fat at an early age; and when they have not this downy appear|ance, a comfortable idea, you will &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, in a cold climate, they are not remarkable for fine forms.

<P>The manners of Stockholm are refined, I hear, by the introduction of gallantry but in the country, romping and cour&s;e freedoms, with coar&s;er allu&s;&s;ions, keep the &s;pirits awake.

and turn for humour, rather than for wit or &s;etiment. I include not, as you may &s;uppo&s;e, in this general character, &s;ome of the nobility and officers, who having travelled, are polite and well informed.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t own to you, that the lower cla&s;s of people here amu&s;e and intere&s;t me much more than the middling, with their api&s;h good breeding and prejudices.

There is &s;uch a charm in tenderne&s;s!&mdash;It is &s;o delight|ful to love our fellew-creatures, and meet the hone&s;t affections as they break forth. Still, my good friend, I begin to think that I &s;hould not like to live continually in the country, with people who&s;e minds have &s;uch a narrow range.

<P>The beauties of nature appear to me now even more alluring than in my youth, becau&s;e my intercour&s;e with the world has formed, without vitiating my ta&s;te. But, with re&s;pect to the inhabitants of the country, my fancy has probably, when di&s;gu&s;ted with artificial man|ners, &s;olaced it&s;elf by joining the advantages of cultivation with the intere&s;ting &s;incerity of

innocence, forgetting the la&s;&s;itude that ig|norance will naturally produce. I like to &s;ee animals &s;porting, and &s;ympathize in their pains and plea&s;ures. Still I love &s;ometimes to view the human face divine, and trace the &s;oul, as well as the heart, in its varying linea|ments.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER V.</HEAD>
<P>HAD I determined to travel in Sweden merely for plea&s;ure, I &s;hould probably have cho&s;en the road to Stockholm, though con|vinced, by repeated ob&s;ervation, that the manners of a people are be&s;t di&s;criminated in the country. The inhabitants of the capital are all of the &s;ame genus; for the varieties in the &s;pe|cies we mu&s;t, therefore, &s;earch where the ha|bitations of men are &s;o &s;eparated as to allow the difference of climate to have its natural effect. And with this difference we are, perhaps, mo&s;t forcibly &s;truck at the fir&s;t view, ju&s;t as we form an e&s;timate of the leading traits of a character at the fir&s;t glance, of which intimacy after|wards makes us almo&s;t lo&s;e &s;ight.</P>
<P>As my affairs called me to Strom&s;tad (the frontier town of Sweden) in my way to Nor|way, I was to pa&s;s over, I heard, the mo&s;t uncultivated part of the country. Still I be|lieve that the grand features of Sweden are the &s;ame every where, and it is only the grand fea|tures that admit of de&s;cription. There is an individuality in every pro&s;pect, which remains in the memory as forcibly depicted as the particular features that have arre&s;ted our atten|tion; yet we cannot find words to di&s;criminate
<PB N="40" REF="031653_0039_0fed8e5b6702e488">
that individuality &s;o as to enable a &s;tranger to &s;ay, this is the face, that the view. We may amu&s;e by &s;etting the imagination to work; but we cannot &s;tore the memory with a fact.</P>
<P>As I wi&s;h to give you a general idea of this country, I &s;hall continue in my de&s;ultory man|ner to make &s;uch ob&s;ervations, and reflections as the circum&s;tances draw forth, without lo&s;ing time, by endeavouring to arrange them.</P>
<P>Travelling in Sweden is very cheap, and e|ven commodious, if you make but the proper arrangements. Here, as in other parts of the continent, it is nece&s;&s;ary to have your own car|riage, and to have a &s;ervant who can &s;peak the language, if you are unacquainted with it. Sometimes a &s;ervant who can drive would be found very u&s;eful, which was our ca&s;e, for I travelled in company with two gentlemen, one of whom had a german &s;ervant who drove very well. This was all the party; for not intend|ing to make a long &s;tay, I left my little girl be|hind me.</P>
<P>As the roads are not much frequented, to a|void waiting three or four hours for hor&s;es, we &s;ent, as is the con&s;tant cu&s;tom, an <HI>avant courier</HI> the night before, to order them at e|very po&s;t, and we con&s;tantly found them rea|dy. Our fir&s;t &s;et I jokingly termed <HI>requi&s;ition</HI> hor&s;es; but afterwards we had almo&s;t always little &s;pirited animals that went on at a round pace.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="031653_0040_0fed8e5d0ba844a8">The roads, making allowance for the ups and downs, are uncommonly good and plea|&s;ant. The expence, including the po&s;tillions and other incidental things, does not amount to more than a &s;hilling the &s;wedi&s;h mile.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Swedi&s;h mile is nearly &s;ix Engli&s;h miles.</NOTE></P>
<P>The inns are tolerable; but not liking the rye bread, I found it nece&s;&s;ary to furni&s;h my|&s;elf with &s;ome wheaten before I &s;et out. The beds too were particularly di&s;agreable to me. It &s;eemed to me that I was &s;inking into a grave when I entered them; for, immer&s;ed it down placed in a &s;ort of box, I expected to be &s;uffo|cated before morning. The &s;leeping between two down beds, they do &s;o even in &s;ummer, mu&s;t be very unwhole&s;ome during any &s;ea&s;on; and I cannot conceive how the people can bear it, e&s;pecially as the &s;ummers are very warm. But warmth they &s;eem not to feel; and, I &s;hould think, were afraid of the air, by always keeping their windows &s;hut. In the winter, I am per&s;uaded, I could not exi&s;t in rooms thus clo&s;ed up, with &s;toves heated in their manner; for they only put wood into them twice a day; and, when the &s;tove is thoroughly heated, they &s;hut the flue, not admitting any air to renew its ela&s;ticity, even when the rooms are crowd|ed with company. The&s;e &s;toves are made of earthenware, and often in a form that orna|ments an apartment, which is never the ca&s;e with the heavy iron ones I have &s;een el&s;ewhere. Stoves may be economical; but I like a fire, a wood one, in preference; and I am convinced
<PB N="42" REF="031653_0041_0fed8e5ea93da1e8">
that the current of air which it attracts renders this the be&s;t mode of warming rooms.</P>
<P>We arrived early the &s;econd evening at a lit|tle village called Qui&s;tram, where we had de|termined to pa&s;s the night; having been in|formed that we &s;hould not afterwards find a tolerable inn until we reached Strom&s;tad.</P>
<P>Advancing towards Qui&s;tram, as the &s;un was beginning to decline, I was particularly impre&s;&s;|ed by the beauty of the &s;ituation. The road was on the declivity of a rocky mountain, &s;lightly covered with a mo&s;&s;y herbage and va|grant firs. At the bottom, a river, &s;traggling among&s;t the rece&s;&s;es of &s;tone, was ha&s;tening forward to the ocean and its grey rocks, of which we had a pro&s;pect on the left, whil&s;t on the right it &s;tole peacefully forward into the meadows, lo&s;ing it&s;elf in a thickly wooded ri&s;|ing ground. As we drew near, the lovelie&s;t banks of wild flowers variegated the pro&s;pect, and promi&s;ed to exhale odours to add to the &s;weetne&s;s of the air, the purity of which you could almo&s;t &s;ee, alas! not &s;mell, for the putri|fying herrings, which they u&s;e as manure, af|ter the oil has been extracted, &s;pread over the patches of the earth, claimed by cultivation, de&s;troyed every other.</P>
<P>It was intolerable, and entered with us into the inn, which was in other re&s;pects a charming retreat</P>
<P>Whil&s;t &s;upper was preparing I cro&s;&s;ed the
<PB N="43" REF="031653_0042_0fed8e604b925760">
bridge, and &s;trolled by the river, li&s;tening to its murmurs. Approaching the bank, the beau|ty of which had attracted my at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ention in the carriage, I recognized many of my old ac|quaintance growing with great luxurian|cy.</P>
<P>Seated on it, I could not avoid noting an ob|vious remark. Sweden appeared to me the country in the world mo&s;t proper to form the botani&s;t and natural hi&s;torian: every object &s;eemed to remind me of the creation of things, of the fir&s;t efforts of &s;portive nature. When a country arrives at a certain &s;tate of perfection, it looks as if it were made &s;o; and curio&s;ity is not excited. Be&s;ides, in &s;ocial life too many objects occur for any to be di&s;tinctly ob&s;erved by the generality of mankind; yet a contem|plative man, or poet, in the country, I do not mean the country abjacent to cities, feels and &s;ees what would e&s;cape vulgar eyes, and draws &s;uitable inferences. This train of reflections might have led me further, in every &s;en&s;e of the word; but I could not e&s;cape from the de|te&s;table evaporation of the herrings, which poi&s;oned all my plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>After making a tolerable &s;upper, for it is not ea&s;y to get fre&s;h provi&s;ions on the road. I retir|ed to be lulled to &s;leep by the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rmuring of a &s;tream, of which I with great difficulty ob|tained &s;ufficient to perform my daily abluti|ons.</P>
<P>The la&s;t battle between the Danes and
<PB N="44" REF="031653_0043_0fed8e64b261cbf0">
Swedes, which gave new life to their ancient enmity, was fought at this place 1788; only &s;eventeen or eighteen were killed; for the great &s;uperiority of the Danes and Norwegians obliged the Swedes to &s;ubmit; but &s;ickne&s;s, and a &s;carcity of provi&s;ions, proved very fatal to their opponents, on their return.</P>
<P>It would be very ea&s;y to &s;earch for the parti|culars of this engagement in the publications of the day; but as this manner of filling my pages does not come within my plan, I probably &s;hould not have remarked that the battle was fought here, were it not to relate an anecdote which I had from good authority.</P>
<P>I noticed when I fir&s;t mentioned this place to you, that we de&s;cended a &s;teep before we came to the inn; an immen&s;e ridge of rocks &s;tretching out on one &s;ide. The inn was &s;hel|tered under them; and about a hundred yards from it was a bridge that cro&s;&s;ed the river, who&s;e murmurs I have celebrated; it was not fordable. The &s;wedi&s;h general received orders to &s;top at the bridge, and di&s;pute the pa&s;&s;age; a mo&s;t advantageous po&s;t for an army &s;o much inferior in force: but the influence of beauty is not confined to courts. The mi&s;tre&s;s of the inn was hand&s;ome: when I &s;aw her there were &s;till &s;ome remains of beauty; and, to pre&s;erve her hou&s;e, the general gave up the only tenable &s;tation. He was afterwards broke for contempt of orders.</P>
<P>Approaching the frontiers, con&s;equently the
<PB N="45" REF="031653_0044_0fed8e6952778618">
&s;ea, nature re&s;umed an a&s;pect ruder and ruder, or rather &s;eemed the bones of the world wait|ing to be clothed with every thing nece&s;&s;ary to give life and beauty. Still it was &s;ublime.</P>
<P>The clouds caught their hue of the rocks that menaced them. The &s;un appeared afraid to &s;hine, the birds cea&s;ed to &s;ing, and the flow|ers to bloom; but the eagle fixed his ne&s;t high among&s;t the rocks, and the vulture hovered o|ver this abode of de&s;olation. The farm hou&s;es, in which only poverty re&s;ided, were formed of logs &s;carcely keeping off the cold and drift|ing &s;now; out of them the inhabitants &s;eldom peeped, and the &s;ports or prattling of children was neither &s;een nor heard. The current of life &s;eemed congealed at the &s;ource: all were not frozen; for it was &s;ummer, you remem|ber; but every thing appeared &s;o dull, that I waited to &s;ee ice, in order to reconcile me to the ab&s;ence of gaiety.</P>
<P>The day before, my attention had frequent|ly been attracted by the wild beauties of the country we pa&s;&s;ed through.</P>
<P>The rocks which to&s;&s;ed their fanta&s;tic heads &s;o high were often covered with pines and firs, varied in the mo&s;t picture&s;que manner. Little woods filled up the rece&s;&s;es, when fore&s;ts did not darken the &s;cene; and vallies and glens, cleared of the trees, di&s;played a dazzling ver|dure which contra&s;ted with the gloom of the &s;hading pines. The eye &s;tole into many a co|vert where tranquillity &s;eemed to have taken

up her abode, and the number of little lakes that continually pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ented them&s;elves added to the peaceful compo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re of the &s;cenery. The little cultivation which appeared did not break the enchantment, nor did ca&s;tles rear their tur|rets aloft to cru&s;h the cottages, and prove that man is more &s;avage than the natives of the woods. I heard of the bears, but never &s;aw them &s;talk forth, which I was &s;orry for; I wi&s;hed to have &s;een one in its wild &s;tate. In the winter, I am told, they &s;ometimes catch a &s;tray cow, which is a heavy lo&s;s to the own|er.</P>
<P>The farms are &s;mall. Indeed mo&s;t of the hou&s;es we &s;aw on the road indicated poverty, or rather that the people could ju&s;t live. To|wards the frontiers they grew wor&s;e and wor&s;e in their appearance, as if not willing to put &s;terility it&s;elf out of countenance. No gardens &s;miled round the habitations, not a potatoe or cabbage to eat with the fi&s;h drying on a &s;tick near the door. A little grain here and there appeared, the long &s;talks of which you might almo&s;t reckon. The day was gloomy when we pa&s;&s;ed over this rejected &s;pot, the wind bleak, and winter &s;eemed to be contending with nature, faintly &s;truggling to change the &s;ea&s;on. Surely, thought I, if the &s;un ever &s;hines here, it cannot warm tho&s;e &s;tones; mo&s;s only cleaves to them, partaking of their hard|ne&s;s; and nothing like vegetable life appears to chear with hope the heart.</P>
<P>So far from thinking that the primitive inha|bitants

The conduct of the followers of Mahomet, and the cru&s;aders, will &s;ufficiently corroborate my a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>Approaching nearer to Strom&s;tad, the ap|pearance of the town proved to be quite in cha|racter with the country we had ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed through. I he&s;itated to u&s;e the word country, yet could not find another; &s;till it would &s;ound ab&s;urd to talk of fields of rocks.</P>
<P>The town was built on, and under them. Three or four weather-beaten trees were
<PB N="48" REF="031653_0047_0fed8e73d775b8d8">
&s;hrinking from the wind; and the gra&s;s grew &s;o &s;paringly, that I could not avoid thinking Dr. John&s;on's hyperbolical a&s;&s;ertion <Q>that the man merited well of his country who made a few blades of gra&s;s grow where they never grew before,</Q> might here have been uttered with &s;trict propriety. The &s;teeple likewi&s;e towered aloft; for what is a church, even a|mong&s;t the Lutherans, without a &s;teeple? But to prevent mi&s;chief in &s;uch an expo&s;ed &s;ituati|on, it is wi&s;ely placed on a rock at &s;ome di&s;|ance, not to endanger the roof of the church.</P>
<P>Rambling about, I &s;aw the door open, and entered, when to my great &s;urpri&s;e I found the clergyman reading prayers, with only the clerk attending. I in&s;tantly thought of Swift's "Dearly beloved Roger;" but on enquiry I learnt that &s;ome one had died that morning, and in Sweden it is cu&s;tomary to pray for the dead.</P>
<P>The &s;un, who I &s;u&s;pected never dared to &s;hine, began now to convince me that he came forth only to torment; for though the wind was &s;till cutting, the rocks became intolerably warm under my feet; whil&s;t the herring ef|fluvia, which I before found &s;o very offen&s;ive, once more a&s;&s;ailed me. I ha&s;tened back to the hou&s;e of a merchant, the little &s;overeign of the place, becau&s;e he was by far the riche&s;t, though not the mayor.</P>
<P>Here we were mo&s;t ho&s;pitably received, and introduced to a very fine and numerous family.

<P>I did not know, for I had not thought of it, that we were to &s;cale &s;ome of the mo&s;t mountain|ous cliffs of Sweden, in our way to the furry which &s;eparates the two countries.</P>
<P>Entering among&s;t the cliffs, we were &s;hel|tered from the wind; warm &s;un-beams began to play, &s;treams to flow, and groves of pines diver&s;ified the rocks. Sometimes they became &s;uddenly bare and &s;ublime. Once, in particu|lar, after mounting the mo&s;t terrific precipice, we had to pa&s;s through a tremendous defile, where the clo&s;ing cha&s;m &s;eemed to threaten us with in&s;tant de&s;truction, when turning quickly, verdant meadows and a beautiful lake relieved and charmed my eyes.</P>
<P>I have never travelled through Switzerland; but one of my companions a&s;&s;ured me, that I &s;hould not there find any thing &s;uperior, if e|qual to the wild grandeur of the&s;e views.</P>
<P>As we had not taken this excur&s;ion into our plan, the hor&s;es had not been previou&s;ly order|ed, which obliged us to wait two hours at the fir&s;t po&s;t. The day was wearing away. The road was &s;o bad, that walking up the precipices con&s;umed the time in&s;en&s;ibly. But as we de|&s;ired hor&s;es at each po&s;t ready at a certain hour, we reckoned on returning more &s;peedily.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="031653_0050_0fed8ec4c8f82868">We &s;topt to dine at a tolerable farm. They brought us out ham, butter, chee&s;e, and milk; and the charge was &s;o moderate, that I &s;cattered a little money among&s;t the children who were peeping at us, in order to pay them for their trouble.</P>
<P>Arrived at the ferry, we were &s;till detained; for the people who attend at the ferries have a &s;tupid kind of &s;luggi&s;hne&s;s in their manner, which is very provoking when you are in ha&s;te. At pre&s;ent I did not feel it; for &s;crambling up the cliffs, my eye followed the river as it rolled between the grand rocky banks; and to complete the &s;cenery, they were covered with firs and pines, through which the wind ru&s;tled, as if it were lulling it&s;elf to &s;leep with the declining &s;un.</P>
<P>Behold us now in Norway; and I could not avoid feeling &s;urpri&s;e at ob&s;erving the differ|ence in the manners of the inhabitants of the two &s;ides of the river; for every thing &s;hews that the norwegians are more indu&s;trious and more opulent. The Swedes, for neighbours are &s;eldom the be&s;t friends, accu&s;e the norwegi|ans of knavery, and they retaliate by bringing a charge of hypocri&s;y again&s;t the Swedes. Local circum&s;tances probably render both un|ju&s;t, &s;peaking from their feelings, rather than rea&s;on: and is this a&s;toni&s;hing when we con|&s;ider that mo&s;t writers of travels have done the &s;ame, who&s;e works have &s;erved as materials for the compilers of univer&s;al hi&s;tories. All are eager to give a national character; which is
<PB N="52" REF="031653_0051_0fed8e78b85b6de0">
rarely ju&s;t, becau&s;e they do not di&s;criminate the natural from the acquired difference. The natural, I believe, on due con&s;ideration, will be found to con&s;i&s;t merely in the degree of vivacity or thoughtfulne&s;s, plea&s;ure, or pain, in&s;pired by the climate, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the varieties which the forms of government, including re|ligion, produce, are much more numerous and un&s;table.</P>
<P>A people have been characterized as &s;tupid by nature; what a paradox! becau&s;e they did not con&s;ider that &s;laves, having no object to &s;timulate indu&s;try, have not their faculties &s;harpened by the only thing that can exerci&s;e them, &s;elf intere&s;t. Others have been brought forward as brutes, having no aptitude for the arts and &s;ciences, only becau&s;e the progre&s;s of improvement had not reached that &s;tage which produces them.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e writers who have con&s;idered the hi&s;tory of man, or of the human mind, on a more enlarged &s;cale, have fallen into &s;imilar errors, not reflecting that the pa&s;&s;ions are w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ak where the nece&s;&s;aries of life are too hardly or too ea&s;ily obtained.</P>

<P>The evening was fine, as is u&s;ual at this &s;ea&s;on; and the refre&s;hing odour of the pine woods became more perceptible; for it was nine o'clock when we left Frederic&s;hall. At the ferry we were detained by a di&s;pute rela|tive to our &s;wedi&s;h pa&s;&s;port, which we did not think of getting counter&s;igned in Nor|way. Midnight was coming on; yet it might with &s;uch propriety have been termed the noon of night, that had Young ever travelled to|wards the north, I &s;hould not have wondered at his becoming enamoured of the moon. But it is not the queen of night alone who reigns here in all her &s;plendor, though the &s;un, loit|ering ju&s;t below the horizon, decks her with a golden tinge from his car, illuminating the cliffs that hide him; the heavens al&s;o, of a clear &s;oftened blue, throw her forward, and the evening &s;tar appears a le&s;&s;er moon to the naked eye. The huge &s;hadows of the rocks, fringed with firs, concentrating the views, without darkening them, excited that tender melancholy which, &s;ublimating the imagination, exalts, rather than depre&s;&s;es the mind.</P>
<P>My companions fell a&s;leep:&mdash;fortunately they did not &s;nore; and I contemplated, fear|le&s;s of idle que&s;tions, a night &s;uch as I had ne|ver before &s;een or felt to charm the &s;en&s;es, and calm the heart.

to the embraces of nature; and my &s;oul ro&s;e to its author, with the chirping of the &s;olitary birds, which began to feel, rather than &s;ee, advancing day. I had lei&s;ure to mark its pro|gre&s;s. The grey morn, &s;treaked with &s;ilvery rays, u&s;hered in the orient beams,&mdash;how beau|tifully varying into purple!&mdash;yet, I was &s;orry to lo&s;e the &s;oft watry clouds which preceded them, exciting a kind of expectation that made me almo&s;t afraid to breathe, le&s;t I &s;hould break the charm.

<P>One of my companions, now awake, per|ceiving that the po&s;tillion had mi&s;taken the road, began to &s;wear at him, and rou&s;ed the other two, who reluctantly &s;hook off &s;leep.</P>

<P>THE &s;ea was boi&s;terous; but, as I had an experienced pilot, I did not appre|hend any danger. Sometimes I was told, boats are driven far out and lo&s;t. However, I &s;el|dom calculate chances &s;o nicely&mdash;&s;ufficient for the day is the obvious evil!</P>
<P>We had to &s;teer among&s;t i&s;lands and huge rocks, rarely lo&s;ing &s;ight of the &s;hore, though it now and then appeared only a mi&s;t that bor|dered the water's edge. The pilot a&s;&s;ured me that the numerous harbours on the Norway coa&s;t were very &s;afe, and the pilot-boats were always on the watch. The Swedi&s;h &s;ide is very dangerous, I am al&s;o informed; and the help of experience is not often at hand, to ena|ble &s;trange ve&s;&s;els to &s;teer clear of the rocks, which lurk below the water, clo&s;e to the &s;hore.</P>
<P>There are no tides here, nor in the cattegate; and, what appeared to me a con&s;equence, no &s;andy beach. Perhaps this ob&s;ervation has been made before; but it did not occur to me till I &s;aw the waves continually beating again&s;t

<P>The wind was fair, till we had to tack about in order to enter Laurvig, where we arrived towards three o'clock in the afternoon. It is a clean, plea&s;ant town, with a con&s;iderable iron|work, which gives life to it.</P>
<P>As the norwegians do not frequently &s;ee tra|vellers, they are very curious to know their bu&s;ine&s;s, and who they are&mdash;&s;o curious that I was half tempted to adopt Dr. Franklin's plan, when travelling in America, where they are equally prying, which was to write on a pa|per&punc; for public in&s;pection, my name, from whence I came, where I was going, and what was my bu&s;ine&s;s. But if I were importuned by their curio&s;ity, their friendly ge&s;tures gra|tified me. A woman, coming alone, intere&s;t|ed them. And I know not whether my weari|ne&s;s gave me a look of peculiar delicacy; but they approached to a&s;&s;i&s;t me, and enquire after my wants, as if they were afraid to hurt, and wi&s;hed to protect me. The &s;ympathy I in&s;pir|ed, thus dropping down from the clouds in a &s;trange land, affected me more than it would have done, had not my &s;pirits been hara&s;&s;ed by various cau&s;es&mdash;by much thinking&mdash;mu&s;ing al|mo&s;t to madne&s;s&mdash;and even by a &s;ort of weak melancholy that hung about my heart at part|ing with my daughter for the fir&s;t time.</P>

<P>But whither am I wandering? I only meant to tell you that the impre&s;&s;ion the kindne&s;s of the &s;imple people made vi&s;ible on my counte|nance increa&s;ed my &s;en&s;ibility to a painful de|gree. I wi&s;hed to have had a room to my&s;elf; for their attention, and rather di&s;tre&s;&s;ing ob|&s;ervation, embarra&s;&s;ed me extremely.

I had a dani&s;h cap|tain of a &s;hip and his mate with me: the for|mer was to ride on hor&s;eback, at which he was not very expert, and the latter to partake of my &s;eat. The driver mounted behind to guide the hor&s;es, and flouri&s;h the whip over our &s;houlders; he would not &s;uffer the reins out of his own hands.

<P>I had to pa&s;s over, I was informed, the mo&s;t fertile and be&s;t cultivated tract of country in Norway. The di&s;tance was three norvegian miles, which are longer than the &s;wedi&s;h.

<HEAD>LETTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the king of Denmark be an ab&s;olute monarch, yet the norwegians appear to enjoy all the ble&s;&s;ings of freedom. Norway may be termed a &s;i&s;ter kingdom; but the people have no viceroy to lord it over them and fatten his dependants with the fruit of their labour.</P>
<P>There are only two counts in the whole country, who have e&s;tates, and exact &s;ome feudal ob&s;ervances from their tenantry. All the re&s;t of the country is divided into &s;mall farms, which belong to the cultivator. It is true, &s;ome few, appertaining to the church, are let; but always on a lea&s;e for life, general|ly renewed in favour of the elde&s;t &s;on, who has this advantage, as well as a right to a double portion of the property. But the value of the farm is e&s;timated; and after his portion is a&s;|&s;igned to him, he mu&s;t be an&s;werable for the re&s;idue to the remaining part of the fami|ly.</P>
<P>Every farmer, for ten years, is obliged to attend annually about twelve days, to learn the military exerci&s;e; but it is always at a &s;mall
<PB N="65" REF="031653_0064_0fed8edcf334d360">
di&s;tance from his dwelling, and does not lead him into any new habits of life.</P>
<P>There are about &s;ix thou&s;and regulars al&s;o, garri&s;oned at Chri&s;tiania and Frederic&s;hall, which are equally re&s;erved, with the militia, for the defence of their own country. So that when the prince royal pa&s;&s;ed into Sweden, in 1788, he was obliged to reque&s;t, not command, them to accompany him on this expedition.</P>
<P>The&s;e corps are mo&s;tly compo&s;ed of the &s;ons of the cottagers, who being labourers on the farms, are allowed a few acres to cultivate for them&s;elves. The&s;e men voluntarily enli&s;t; but it is only for a limited period, (&s;ix years) at the expiration of which they have the liberty of re|tiring. The pay is only two-pence a day, and bread; &s;till, con&s;idering the cheapne&s;s of the country, it is more than &s;ixpence in England.</P>
<P>The di&s;tribution of landed property into &s;mall farms, produces a degree of equality which I have &s;eldom &s;een el&s;ewhere; and the rich be|ing all merchants, who are obliged to divide their per&s;onal fortune among&s;t their children, the boys always receiving twice as much as the girls, property has not a chance of accumulating till overgrown wealth de&s;troys the balance of liberty,</P>
<P>You will be &s;urpri&s;ed to hear me talk of li|berty; yet the norwegians appear to me to be the mo&s;t free community I have ever ob&s;erv|ed.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="031653_0065_0fed8e8f8468d090">The mayor of each town or di&s;trict, and the judges in the country, exerci&s;e an authority almo&s;t patriarchal. They can do much good, but little harm, as every individual can appeal from their judgment: and as they may always be forced to give a rea&s;on for their conduct, it is generally regulated by prudence. 'They have not time to learn to be tyrants,' &s;aid a gentleman to me, with whom I di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The farmers not fearing to be turned out of their farms, &s;hould they di&s;plea&s;e a man in pow|er, and having no vote to be commanded at an election for a mock repre&s;entative, are a manly race: for not being obliged to &s;ubmit to any deba&s;ing tenure, in order to live, or advance them&s;elves in the world, they act with an in|dependent &s;pirit. I never yet have heard of any thing like domineering, or oppre&s;&s;ion, ex|cepting &s;uch as has ari&s;en from natural cau&s;es. The fredom the people enjoy may, perhaps, render them a little litigious, and &s;ubject them to the impo&s;itions of cunning practitioners of the law: but the authority of office is bounded, and the emoluments of it do not de&s;troy its utility.</P>
<P>La&s;t year a man, who had abu&s;ed his power, was ca&s;hiered, on the repre&s;entation of the peo|ple to the bailiff of the di&s;trict.</P>
<P>There are four in Norway, who might with propriety be termed &s;heriffs; and, from their

&s;entence, an appeal, by either party, may be made to Copenhagen.</P>
<P>Near mo&s;t of the towns are commons, on which the cows of all the inhabitants, indi&s;|criminately, are allowed to graze. The poor, to whom a cow is nece&s;&s;ary, are almo&s;t &s;up|ported by it. Be&s;ides, to render living more ea&s;y, they all go out to fi&s;h in their own boats; and fi&s;h is their principal food.</P>
<P>The lower cla&s;s of people in the towns are in general &s;ailors; and the indu&s;trious have u&s;ual|ly little ventures of their own that &s;erve to render the winter comfortable.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the country at large, the im|portation is con&s;iderably in favour of Nor|way.</P>
<P>They are forbidden, at pre&s;ent, to export corn or rye, on account of the advanced price.</P>
<P>The re&s;triction which mo&s;t re&s;embles the painful &s;ubordination of Ireland, is that ve&s;&s;els, trading to the We&s;t Indies, are obliged to pa&s;s by their own ports, and unload their cargoes at Copenhagen, which they afterwards re-&s;hip. The duty is indeed incon&s;iderable; but the navigation being dangerous, they run a double ri&s;k.</P>
<P>There is an exci&s;e on all articles of con&s;ump|tion brought to the towns; but the officers are
<PB N="68" REF="031653_0067_0fed8e91247651f0">
not &s;trict; and it would be reckoned invidious to enter a hou&s;e to &s;earch, as in England.</P>
<P>The norwegians appear to me a &s;en&s;ible, &s;hrewd people, with little &s;cientific knowledge, and &s;till le&s;s ta&s;te for literature: but they are arriving at the epoch which precedes the in|troduction of the arts and &s;ciences.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the towns are &s;ea-ports, and &s;eaports are not favourable to improvement. The cap|tains acquire a little &s;uperficial knowledge by travelling, which their indefatigable attention to the making of money prevents their dige&s;t|ing; and the fortune that they thus labouriou&s;|ly acquire, is &s;pent, as it u&s;ally is in towns of this de&s;cription, in &s;hew and good living. They love their country, but have not much public &s;pirit.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The grand virtues of the heart particular|ly the enlarged humanity which extends to the whole human race, depend more on the under|&s;tanding, I believe, than is generally imagin|ed.</NOTE> Their exertions are, generally &s;peaking, only for their families; which I con|ceive will always be the ca&s;e, till politics, be|coming a &s;ubject of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, enlarges the heart by opening the under&s;tanding. The french revolution will have this effect, They &s;ing at pre&s;ent, with great glee, many repub|lican &s;ongs, and &s;eem earne&s;tly to wi&s;h that the republic may &s;tand; yet they appear very much attached to their prince royal; and, as far as rumour can give an idea of a character, he ap|pears
<PB N="69" REF="031653_0068_0fed8ee035feccb8">
to merit their attachment. When I am at Copenhagen, I &s;hall be able to a&s;certain on what foundation their good opinion is built; at pre&s;ent I am only the echo of it.</P>
<P>In the year 1788 he travelled through Nor|way; and acts of mercy gave dignity to the parade, and intere&s;t to the joy, his pre&s;ence in|&s;pired. At this town he pardoned a girl con|demned to die for murdering an illegitimate child, a crime &s;eldom committed in this coun|try. She is &s;ince married, and become the careful mother of a family. This might be gi|ven as an in&s;tance, that a de&s;perate act is not always a proof of an incorrigible depravity of character; the only plau&s;ible excu&s;e that has been brought forward to ju&s;tify the infliction of capital puni&s;hments.</P>
<P>I will relate two or three other anecdotes to you; for the truth of which I will not vouch, becau&s;e the facts were not of &s;ufficient con&s;e|quence for me to take much pains to a&s;certain them; and, true or fal&s;e, they evince that the people like to make a kind of mi&s;tre&s;s of their prince.</P>
<P>An officer, mortally wounded at the ill-ad|vi&s;ed battle of Qui&s;tram, de&s;ired to &s;peak with the prince; and, with his dying breath, earn|e&s;tly recommended to his care a young woman of Chri&s;tiania, to whom he was engaged. When the prince returned there, a ball was gi|ven by the chief inhabitants. He inquired whether this unfortunate girl was invited, and
<PB N="70" REF="031653_0069_0fed8e96b1589950">
reque&s;ted that &s;he might, though of the &s;econd cla&s;s. The girl came; &s;he was pretty; and finding her&s;elf among&s;t her &s;uperiors, ba&s;hfully &s;at down as near the door as po&s;&s;ible, nobody taking notice of her. Shortly after, the prince entering, immediately inquired for her, and a&s;ked her to dance, to the mortification of the rich dames. After it was over he handed her to the top of the room, and placing him&s;elf by her, &s;poke of the lo&s;s &s;he had &s;u&s;tained, with tenderne&s;s, promi&s;ing to provide for any one &s;he &s;hould marry,&mdash;as the &s;tory goes. She is &s;ince married, and he has not forgotten his promi&s;e.</P>
<P>A little girl, during the &s;ame expedition, in Sweden, who informed him that the logs of a bridge were cut underneath, was taken by his orders to Chri&s;tiania, and put to &s;chool at his expence.</P>
<P>Before I retail other beneficial effects of his journey, it is nece&s;&s;ary to inform you that the laws here are mild, and do not puni&s;h capitally for any crime but murder, which &s;eldom oc|curs. Every other offence merely &s;ubjects the delinquent to impri&s;onment and labour in the ca&s;tle, or rather ar&s;enal, at Chri&s;tiania, and the fortre&s;s at Frederic&s;hall. The fir&s;t and &s;econd conviction produces a &s;entence for a limited number of years,&mdash;two, three, five, or &s;even, proportioned to the atrocity of the crime. Af|ter the third he is whipped, branded in the forehead, and condemned to perpetual &s;lavery. This is the ordinary march of ju&s;tice.
<PB N="71" REF="031653_0070_0fed8ee4aaf62f28">
For &s;ome flagrant breaches of tru&s;t, or acts of wanton cruelty, criminals have been condemned to &s;lavery for life, the fir&s;t time of conviction, but not frequently. The number of the&s;e &s;laves do not, I am informed, amount to more than an hundred, which is not con&s;i|derable, compared with the population, up|wards of eight hundred thou&s;and. Should I pa&s;s through Chri&s;tiania, on my return to Gothenburg, I &s;hall probably have an opportu|nity of learning other particulars.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a hou&s;e of correction at Chri&s;ti|ania for trifling mi&s;demeanors, where the wo|men are confined to labour and impri&s;onment even for life. The &s;tate of the pri&s;oners was repre&s;ented to the prince; in con&s;equence of which, he vi&s;ited the ar&s;enal and hou&s;e of cor|rection. The &s;laves at the ar&s;enal were loaded with irons of a great weight; he ordered them to be lightened as much as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The people in the hou&s;e of correction were commanded not to &s;peak to him; but four wo|men, condemned to remain there for life, got into the pa&s;&s;age, and fell at his feet. He grant|ed them a pardon; and inquiring re&s;pecting the treatment of the pri&s;oners, he was inform|ed that they were frequently whipt going in, and coming out; and for any fault, at the di&s;|cretion of the in&s;pectors. This cu&s;tom he hu|manely aboli&s;hed; though &s;ome of the principal inhabitants, who&s;e &s;ituation in life had rai&s;ed them above the temptation of &s;tealing, were of opinion that the&s;e cha&s;ti&s;ements were nece&s;&s;a|ry and whole&s;ome.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="031653_0071_0fed8e9b61f95788">In &s;hort, every thing &s;eems to announce that the prince really cheri&s;hes the laudable ambiti|on of fulfilling the duties of his &s;tation. This ambition is cheri&s;hed and directed by the count Bern&s;torf, the prime mini&s;ter of Denmark, who is univer&s;ally celebrated for his abilities and virtue. The happine&s;s of the people is a &s;ub&s;tantial eulogium: and, from all I can ga|ther, the inhabitants of Denmark and Norway are the lea&s;t oppre&s;&s;ed people of Europe. The pre&s;s is free. They tran&s;late any of the french publications of the day, deliver their opinion on the &s;ubject and di&s;cu&s;s tho&s;e it leads to with great freedom, and without fearing to di&s;plea&s;e the government.</P>
<P>On the &s;ubject of religion they are likewi&s;e becoming tolerant, at lea&s;t, and perhaps have advanced a &s;tep further in free-thinking. One writer has ventured to deny the divinity of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and to que&s;tion the nece&s;&s;ity or utility of the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem, without being con&s;idered univer&s;ally as a mon&s;ter, which would have been the ca&s;e a few years ago. They have tran&s;lated many german works on education; and though they have not adopted any of their plans, it is become a &s;ubject of di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion. There are &s;ome grammar and free &s;chools; but, from what I hear, not very good ones. All the children learn to read, write, and ca&s;t accounts, for the purpo&s;es of common life. They have no univer&s;ity; and nothing that de&s;erves the name of &s;cience is taught; nor do individuals, by pur&s;uing any branch of knowledge, excite a degree of curi|o&s;ity
<PB N="73" REF="031653_0072_0fed8ee7b77a4540">
which is the forerunner of improvement. Knowledge is not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to enable a con&s;iderable portion of the community to live; and, till it is, I fear, it never becomes general.</P>
<P>In this country, where minerals abound, there is not one collection; and, in all proba|bility, I venture a conjecture, the want of me|chanical and chemical knowledge renders the &s;ilver mines unproductive; for the quantity of &s;ilver obtained every year is not &s;ufficient to de|fray the expences. It has been urged, that the employment of &s;uch a number of hands is very beneficial. But a po&s;itive lo&s;s is never to be done away; and the men, thus employed, would naturally find &s;ome other means of liv|ing, in&s;tead of being thus a dead weigh on go|vernment, or rather on the community from whom its revenue is drawn.</P>
<P>About three engli&s;h miles from Ton&s;berg there is a &s;alt work, belonging, like all their e&s;tabli&s;hments, to government, in which they employ above an hundred and fifty men, and maintain nearly five hundred people, who earn their living. The clear profit, an increa&s;ing one, amounts to two thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. And as the elde&s;t &s;on of the in&s;pector, an inge|nious young man, has been &s;ent by the govern|ment to travel, and acquire &s;ome mathematical and chemical knowledge in Germany, it has a chance of being improved. He is the only per|&s;on I have met with here, who appears to have
<PB N="74" REF="031653_0073_0fed8e9e6aadb478">
a &s;cientific turn of mind. I do not mean to a&s;|&s;ert that I have not met with others, who have a &s;pirit of inquiry.</P>
<P>The &s;alt-works at St. Ubes are ba&s;ons in the &s;and, and the &s;un produces the evaporation: but here there is no beach. Be&s;ides, the heat of &s;ummer is &s;o &s;hort-lived, that it would be idle to contrive machines for &s;uch an incon&s;i|derable portion of the year. They therefore always u&s;e fires; and the whole e&s;tabli&s;hment appears to be regulated with judgment.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation is well cho&s;en and beautiful. I do not find, from the ob&s;ervation of a per&s;on who has re&s;ided here for forty years, that the &s;ea advances or recedes on this coa&s;t.</P>
<P>I have already remarked, that little attenti|on is paid to education, excepting reading, writing, and the rudiments of arithmetic; I ought to have added, that a catechi&s;m is care|fully taught, and the children obliged to read in the churches, before the congregation, to prove that they are not neglected.</P>
<P>Degrees, to enable any one to practi&s;e any profe&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t be taken at Copenhagen; and the people of this country, having the good &s;en&s;e to perceive that men who are to live in a community &s;hould at lea&s;t acquire the elements of their knowledge, and form their youthful attachments there, are &s;eriou&s;ly endeavoring to e&s;tabli&s;h an univer&s;ity in Norway. And
<PB N="75" REF="031653_0074_0fed8ee95a50b990">
Ton&s;berg, as a centrical place in the be&s;t part of the country, had the mo&s;t &s;uffrages; for, experiencing the bad effects of a metropolis, they have determined not to have it in or near Chri&s;tiania. Should &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment take place, it will promote inquiry throughout the country, and give a new face to &s;ociety. Pre|miums have been offered, and prize que&s;tions written, which I am told have merit. The building college-halls, and other appendages of the &s;eat of &s;cience, might enable Ton&s;berg to recover its pri&s;tine con&s;equence; for it is one of the mo&s;t ancient towns of Norway, and once contained nine churches. At pre&s;ent there are only two. One is a very old &s;truc|ture and has a gothic re&s;pectability about it, which &s;carcely amounts to grandeur, becau&s;e, to render a gothic pile grand, it mu&s;t have a huge unwieldine&s;s of appearance. The chapel of Wind&s;or may be an exception to this rule; I mean before it was in its pre&s;ent <HI>nice, clean</HI> &s;tate. When I fir&s;t &s;aw it, the pillars within had acquired, by time, a &s;ombre hue, which accorded with the architecture; and the gloom increa&s;ed its dimen&s;ions to the eye by hiding its parts; but now it all bur&s;ts on the view at once; and the &s;ublimity has vani&s;hed before the bru&s;h and broom; for it has been white-wa&s;h|ed and &s;craped till it is become as bright and neat as the pots and pans in a notable hou&s;e|wife's kitchen&mdash;yes; the very &s;purs on the re|cumbent knights were deprived of their vene|rable ru&s;t, to give a &s;triking proof that a love of order in trifles, and ta&s;t for proportion and

arrangement, are very di&s;tinct. The glare of light thus introduced, entirely de&s;troys the &s;entiment the&s;e piles are calculated to in&s;pire; &s;o that, when I heard &s;omething like a jig from the organ-loft, I thought it an excellent hall for dancing or fea&s;ting.

<HEAD>LETTER VIII.</HEAD>
<P>TONSBERG was formerly the re&s;i|dence of one of the little &s;overeigns of Norway; and on an adjacent mountain the ve&s;tiges of a fort remain, which was battered down by the &s;wedes; the enterance of the bay lying clo&s;e to it.</P>
<P>Here I have frequently &s;trayed, &s;overeign of the wa&s;te. I &s;eldom met any human crea|ture; and &s;ometines, reclining on the mo&s;&s;y down, under the &s;helter of a rock, the prat|tling of the &s;ea among&s;t the pebbles has hilled me to &s;leep&mdash;no fear of any r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">de &s;atyr's ap|proaching to interrupt my repo&s;e. Balmy were the &s;lumbers, and &s;oft the gales, that refre&s;hed me, when I awoke to follow, with an eye vaguely curious, the white &s;ails, as they turned the cliffs, or &s;eemed to take &s;hel|ter under the pines which covered the little i&s;lands that &s;o gracefully ro&s;e to render the terrific ocean beautiful. The fi&s;hermen were calmly ca&s;ting their nets; whil&s;t the &s;eagulls hovered over the unruffled deep. Every thing &s;eemed to harmonize into tranquility&mdash;even the mournful call of the bittern was in cadence with the tinkling bells on the necks of the cows, that, pacing &s;lowly one after the other,
<PB N="81" REF="031653_0080_0fed8ef2774648a8">
along an inviting path in the vale below, were repairing to the cottages to be milked. With what ineffable plea&s;ure have I not gazed&mdash;and gazed again, lo&s;ing my breath through my eyes&mdash;my very &s;oul diffu&s;ed it&s;elf in the &s;cene and, &s;eeming to become all &s;en&s;es, glided in the &s;carcely-agitated waves, melted in the fre&s;hen|ing breeze, or, taking its flight with fairy wing, to the mi&s;ty mountains which bounded the pro&s;pect, fancy tript over new lawns, more beautiful even than the lovely &s;lopes on the winding &s;hore before me.&mdash;I pau&s;e, a|gain breathle&s;s, to trace, with renewed delight, &s;entiments which entranced me, when, turn|ing my humid eyes from the expan&s;e below to the vault above, my &s;ight pierced the fleecy clouds that &s;oftened the azure brightne&s;s; and, imperceptibly recalling the reveries of child|hood, I bowed before the awful throne of my Creator, whil&s;t I re&s;ted on its foot&s;tool.</P>
<P>You have &s;ometimes wondered, my dear friend, at the extreme affection of my nature&mdash; But &s;uch is the temperature of my &s;oul&mdash;It is not the vivacity of youth, the hay-day of exi&s;tance. For years have I endeavoured to calm an impetuous tide&mdash;labouring to make my feelings take an orderly cour&s;e.&mdash;It was &s;triving again&s;t the &s;tream.&mdash;I mu&s;t love and admire with warmth, or I &s;ink into &s;adne&s;s. Tokens of love which I have received have rapt me in ely&s;ium&mdash;purifying the heart they en|chanted.&mdash;My bo&s;om &s;till glows.&mdash;Do not &s;aucily a&s;k, repeating Sterne's que&s;tion, <Q>Ma|ria is it &s;till &s;o warm?</Q> Sufficiently, O my

God! has it been chilled by &s;orrow and un|kindne&s;s&mdash;&s;till nature will prevail&mdash;and if I blu&s;h at recollecting pa&s;t enjoyment, it is the ro&s;y hue of plea&s;ure heightened by mode&s;ty; for the blu&s;h of mode&s;ty and &s;hame are as di&s;|tinct as the emotions by which they are produc|ed.</P>
<P>I need &s;carcely inform you, after telling you of my walks, that my con&s;titution has been renovated here; and that I have recovered my activity, even whil&s;t attaining a little <HI>em|bonpoint.</HI> My imprudence la&s;t winter, and &s;ome untoward accidents ju&s;t at the time I was weaning my child, had reduced me to a &s;tate of weakne&s;s which I never before experienced. A &s;low fever preyed on me every night, during my re&s;idence in Sweden, and after I arrived at Ton&s;berg. By chance I found a fine rivulet filtered through the rocks, and confined in a ba&s;on for the cattle. It ta&s;ted to me like a chalybeat; at any rate it was pure; and the good effect of the various waters which inva|lids are &s;ent to drink, depends, I believe more on the air, exerci&s;e and change of &s;cene, than on their medicinal qualities. I therefore deter|mined to turn my morning walks towards it, and &s;eek for health from the nymph of the fountain; partaking of the beverage offered to the tenants of the &s;hade.</P>
<P>Chance likewi&s;e led me to di&s;cover a new plea&s;ure, equally beneficial to my health. I wi&s;hed to avail my&s;elf of my vicinity to the &s;ea, and bathe; but it was not po&s;&s;ible near the
<PB N="83" REF="031653_0082_0fed8ef585247f70">
town: there was no convenience. The young woman whom I mentioned to you, propo&s;ed rowing me acro&s;s the water, among&s;t the rocks; but as &s;he was pregnant, I in&s;i&s;ted on taking one of the oars, and learning to row. It was not difficult; and I do not know a plea&s;anter exer|ci&s;e. I &s;oon became expert, and my train of thinking kept time, as it were, with the oars, or I &s;uffered the boat to be carried along by the current, indulging a plea&s;ing forgetfulne&s;s, or fallacious is hopes.&mdash;How fallacious! yet, with|ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> hope, what is to &s;u&s;tain life, but the fear of ann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hilation&mdash;the only thing of which I have ever felt a dread&mdash;I cannot bear to think of be|ing no more&mdash;of lo&s;ing my&s;elf&mdash;though exi&s;t|ence is often but a painful con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of mi&s;e|ry; nay, it appears to me impo&s;&s;ible that I &s;hould cea&s;e to exi&s;t, or that this active, re&s;t|le&s;s &s;pirit, equally alive to joy and &s;orrow, &s;hould only be organized du&s;t&mdash;ready to fly abroad the moment the &s;pring &s;naps, or the &s;park goes out, which kept it together. Surely &s;omething re&s;ides in this heart that is not pe|ri&s;hable&mdash;and life is more than a dream.</P>
<P>Sometimes, to take up my oar, once more, when the &s;ea was calm, I was amu&s;ed by di|&s;turbing the innumerable young &s;tar fi&s;h which floated ju&s;t below the &s;urface: I had never ob|&s;erved them before; for they have not a hard &s;hell, like tho&s;e which I have &s;een on the &s;ea|&s;hore. They look like thickened water, with a white edge; and four purple circles, of dif|ferent forms, were in the middle, over an incredible number of fibres, or white lines.
<PB N="84" REF="031653_0083_0fed8eaf333fb488">
Touching them, the cloudy &s;ub&s;tance would turn or clo&s;e, fir&s;t on one &s;ide, then on the other, very gracefully; but when I took one of them up in the ladle with which I heaved the water out of the boat, it appeared only a colourle&s;s jelly.</P>
<P>I did not &s;ee any of the &s;eals, numbers of which followed our boat when we landed in Sweden; for though I like to &s;port in the wa|ter I &s;hould have had no de&s;ire to join in their gambols.</P>
<P>Enough, you will &s;ay, of inanimate nature, and of brutes, to u&s;e the lordly phra&s;e of man; let me hear &s;omething of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>The gentleman with whom I had bu&s;ine&s;s, is the mayor of Ton&s;berg; he &s;peaks engli&s;h intelligibly; and, having a &s;ound under&s;tand|ing, I was &s;orry that his numerous occupations prevented my gaining as much information from him as I could have drawn forth, had we frequently conver&s;ed. The people of the town, as far as I had an opportunity of know|ing their &s;entiments, are extreamly well &s;atis|fied with his manner of di&s;charging his office. He has a degree of information and good &s;en&s;e which excites re&s;pect, whil&s;t a chearfulne&s;s, almo&s;t amounting to gaiety, enables him to re|concile differences, and keep his neighbours in good humour.&mdash;I lo&s;t my hor&s;e, <Q>&s;aid a wo|man to me; but ever &s;ince, when I want to &s;end to the mill, or go out, the mayor
<PB N="85" REF="031653_0084_0fed349aeee0f618">
lends me one.&mdash;He &s;colds if I do not come for it.</Q></P>
<P>A criminal was branded, during my &s;tay here, for the third offence; but the relief he received made him declare that the judge was one of the be&s;t men in the world.</P>
<P>I &s;ent this wretch a trifle, at different times, to take with him into &s;lavery. As it was more than he expected, he wi&s;hed very much to &s;ee me; and this wi&s;h brought to my re|membrance an anecdote I heard when I was in Li&s;bon.</P>
<P>A wretch who had been impri&s;oned &s;everal years, during which period lamps had been put up, was at la&s;t condemned to a cruel death; yet, in his way to execution, be only wi&s;hed for one night's re&s;pite, to &s;ee the city light|ed.</P>
<P>Having dined in company at the mayor's, I was invited with his family to &s;pend the day at one of the riche&s;t merchant's hou&s;es.&mdash;Though I could not &s;peak dani&s;h, I knew that I could &s;ee a great deal: yes; I am per&s;uaded that I have formed a very ju&s;t opinion of the character of the norwegians, without being able to hold conver&s;e with them.</P>
<P>I had expected to meet &s;ome company; yet was a little di&s;concerted at being u&s;hered into an appartment full of well-dre&s;&s;ed people; and, glancing my eyes round, they re&s;ted on &s;everal
<PB N="86" REF="031653_0085_0fed8eb0d61fa2a0">
very pretty faces. Ro&s;y cheeks, &s;parkling eyes, and light brown or golden locks; for I never &s;aw &s;o much hair with a yellow ca&s;t; and, with their fine complexions, it looked very be|coming.</P>
<P>The&s;e women &s;eem a mixture of indolence and vivacity; they &s;carcely ever walk out, and were a&s;toni&s;hed that I &s;hould, for plea&s;ure; yet they are immoderately fond of dancing. Unaffected in their manners, if they have no pretentions to elegance, &s;implicity often pro|duces a gracefulne&s;s of deportment, when they are animated by a particular de&s;ire to plea&s;e&mdash; which was the ca&s;e at pre&s;ent. The &s;olitari|ne&s;s of my &s;ituation, which they thought ter|rible, intere&s;ted them very much in my favour. They gathered round me&mdash;&s;ung to me&mdash;and one of the prettie&s;t, to whom I gave my hand, with &s;ome degree of cordiality, to meet the glance of her eyes, ki&s;&s;ed me very affectionate|ly.</P>
<P>At dinner which was conducted with great ho&s;pitality, though we remained at table too long, they &s;ung &s;everal &s;ongs, and, among&s;t the re&s;t, tran&s;lations of &s;ome patriotic french ones. As the evening advanced, they became playful, and we kept up a &s;ort of conver&s;ation of ge&s;tures. As their minds were totally un|cultivated, I did not lo&s;e much, perhaps gain|ed, by not being able to under&s;tand them; for fancy probably filled up, more to their advan|tage, the void in the picture. Be that as it may, they excited my &s;ympathy; and I was
<PB N="87" REF="031653_0086_0fed8efcf7485418">
very much flattered when I was told, the next day, that they &s;aid it was a plea&s;ure to look at me, I appeared &s;o good natured.</P>
<P>The men were generally captains of &s;hips. Several &s;poke engli&s;h very tolerably; but they were merely matter of fact men, confined to a very narrow circle of ob&s;ervation. I found it difficult to obtain from them any informa|tion re&s;pecting their own country, when the fumes of tobacco did not keep me at a di&s;|tance.</P>
<P>I was invited to partake of &s;ome other fea&s;ts, and always had to complain of the quantity of provi&s;ion, and the length of time taken to con|&s;ume it; for it would not have been proper to have &s;aid devour, all went on &s;o fair and &s;oftly. The &s;ervants wait as &s;lowly as their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es carve.</P>
<P>The young women here, as well as in Swe|den, have commonly bad teeth, which I attri|bute to the &s;ame cau&s;es. They are fond of finery, but do not pay the nece&s;&s;ary attention to their per&s;ons, to render beauty le&s;s tran&s;ient than a flower; and that intere&s;ting expre&s;&s;i|on which &s;entiment and accompli&s;hments give, &s;eldom &s;upplies its place.</P>
<P>The &s;ervants have likewi&s;e an inferior &s;ort of food here; but their ma&s;ters are not allowed to &s;trike them with impunity. I might have added mi&s;tre&s;&s;es; for it was a complaint of this
<PB N="88" REF="031653_0087_0fed8eb276c1a3a0">
kind, brought before the mayor, which led me to a knowledge of the fact.</P>
<P>The wages are low, which is particularly unju&s;t, becau&s;e the price of clothes is much higher than provi&s;ions. A young woman, who is wet nur&s;e to the mi&s;tre&s;s of the inn where I lodge, receives only twelve dollars a year, and pays ten for the nur&s;ing of her own child; the father had run away to get clear of the expence. There was &s;omething in this mo&s;t painful &s;tate of widowhood which excited my compa&s;&s;ion, and led me to reflecti|ons on the in&s;tability of the mo&s;t flattering plans of happine&s;s, that were painful in the extreme, till I was ready to a&s;k whether this world was not created to exhibit every po&s;&s;ible combinati|on of wretchedne&s;s. I a&s;ked the&s;e que&s;tions of a heart writhing with angui&s;h, whil&s;t I li&s;ten|ed to a melancholy ditty &s;ung by this poor girl. It was too early for thee to be abandoned, thought I, and I ha&s;tened out of the hou&s;e, to take my &s;olitary evening's walk&mdash;And here I am again, to talk of any thing, but the pangs ari&s;ing from the di&s;covery of e&s;tranged affecti|on, and the lonely &s;adne&s;s of a de&s;erted heart.</P>
<P>The father and mother, if the father can be a&s;certained, are obliged to maintain an illegiti|mate child at their joint expence; but, &s;hould the father di&s;appear, go up the country or to &s;ea, the mother mu&s;t maintain it her&s;elf. How|ever, accidents of this kind do not prevent their marrying; and then it is not unu&s;ual to take the child or children home; and they are
<PB N="89" REF="031653_0088_0fed8f0006cead00">
brought up very amicably with the marriage progeny.</P>
<P>I took &s;ome pains to learn what books were written originally in their language; but for any certain information re&s;pecting the &s;tate of dani&s;h literature, I mu&s;t wait till I arrive at Copenhagen.</P>
<P>The &s;ound of the language is &s;oft, a great proportion of the words ending in vowels; and there is a &s;implicity in the turn of &s;ome of the phra&s;es which have been tran&s;lated to me, that plea&s;ed and intere&s;ted me. In the country, the farmers u&s;e the <HI>thou</HI> and <HI>thee</HI>; and they do not acquire the police plurals of the towns by meeting at market. The not having markets e&s;tabli&s;hed in the large towns appears to me a great inconvenience. When the farmers have any thing to &s;ell, they bring it to the neighbouring town, and take it from hou&s;e to hou&s;e. I am &s;urpri&s;ed that the inha|bitants do not feel how very incommodions this u&s;age is to both parties, and redre&s;s it. They indeed perceive it; for when I have introduced the &s;ubject, they acknowledged that they were often in want of nece&s;&s;aries, there being no butchers, and they were often obliged to buy what they did not want; yet it was the <HI>cu&s;tom</HI>; and the changing of cu&s;toms of a long &s;tanding requires more energy than they yet po&s;&s;e&s;s. I received a &s;imilar reply, when I attempted to per&s;uade the women that they injured their children by keeping them too warm. The only way of parrying off my rea&s;oning was,
<PB N="90" REF="031653_0089_0fed8eb581a55360">
that they mu&s;t do as other people did. In &s;hort, rea&s;on on any &s;ubject of change, and they &s;top you by &s;aying that "the town would talk." "A per&s;on of &s;en&s;e, with a large fortune, to in&s;ure re&s;pect might be very u&s;eful here, by inducing them to treat their children, and ma|nage their &s;ick properly, and eat food dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;impler manner: the example, for in&s;tance, of a count's lady.</P>
<P>Reflecting on the&s;e prejudices made me revert to the wi&s;dom of tho&s;e legi&s;lators who e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in&s;titutions for the good of the body, under the pretext of &s;erving heaven for the &s;al|vation of the &s;oul. The&s;e might with &s;trict propriety be termed pious frauds; and I admire the peruvian pair for a&s;&s;erting that they came from the &s;un, when their conduct proved that they meant to enlighten a benighted country, who&s;e obedience, or even attention, could only be &s;ecured by awe.</P>
<P>Thus much for conquering the <HI>inertia</HI> of rea&s;on; but, when it is once in motion, fables, once held &s;acred, may be ridiculed; and &s;acred they were, when u&s;eful to mankind.&mdash;Prome|theus alone &s;tole fire to animate the fir&s;t man; his po&s;terity need not &s;upernatural aid to pre|&s;erve the &s;pecies, though love is generally term|ed a flame; and it may not be nece&s;&s;ary much longer to &s;uppo&s;e men in&s;pired by heaven to in|culcate the duties which demand &s;pecial grace, when rea&s;on convinces them that they are the happie&s;t who are the mo&s;t nobly employ|ed.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IX.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE already informed you that there are only two noblemen who have e&s;tates of any magnitude in Norway. One of the&s;e has a hou&s;e near Ton&s;berg, at which he has not re&s;ided for &s;ome years, having been at court, or on emba&s;&s;ies. He is now the dani&s;h amba&s;|&s;ador in London. The hou&s;e is plea&s;antly &s;ituated, and the grounds about it fine; but their neglected appearance plainly tells that there is nobody at home.</P>
<P>A &s;tupid kind of &s;adne&s;s, to my eye, always reigns in a huge habitation where only &s;er|vants live to put ca&s;es on the furniture and o|pen the windows. I enter as I would into the tomb of the Capulets, to look at the family pictures that here frown in armour, or &s;mile in ermine. The mildew re&s;pects not the lordly robe; and the worm riots unchecked on the cheek of beauty.</P>
<P>There was nothing in the architecture of the building, or the form of the furniture, to detain me from the avenue where the aged pines &s;tretched along maje&s;tically. Time had given a greyi&s;h ca&s;t to their ever-green foliage; and they &s;tood, like firs of the fore&s;t, &s;helt|tered
<PB N="93" REF="031653_0092_0fed8f0779ee0848">
on all &s;ides by a ri&s;ing progeny. I had not ever &s;een &s;o many oaks together in Nor|way, as in the&s;e woods, nor &s;uch large a&s;pens as here were agitated by the breeze, rendering the wind audible&mdash;nay, mu&s;ical; for melody &s;eemed on the wing around me. How differ|ent was the fre&s;h odour that re-animated me in the avenue, from the damp chillne&s;s of the apartments; and as little did the gloomy thoughtfulne&s;s excited by the du&s;ty hangings, and worm-eaten pictures, re&s;emble the reve|ries in&s;pired by the &s;oothing melancholy of their &s;hade. In the winter, the&s;e augu&s;t pines, tow|ering above the &s;now, mu&s;t relieve the eye beyond mea&s;ure, and give life to the white wa&s;te.</P>
<P>The continual recurrence of pine and fir groves, in the day, &s;ometimes wearies the &s;ight; but, in the evening, nothing can be more picture&s;que, or, more properly &s;peaking, better calculated, to produce poetical images. Pa&s;&s;ing through them, I have been &s;truck with a my&s;tic kind of reverence, and I did, as it were, homage to their venerable &s;hadows. Not nymphs, but philo&s;ophers, &s;eemed to in|habit them&mdash;ever mu&s;ing; I could &s;carcely conceive that they were without &s;ome con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s of exi&s;tence&mdash;without a calm enjoyment of the plea&s;ure they diffu&s;ed.</P>
<P>How often do my feelings produce ideas that remind me of the origin of many poetical fictions. In &s;olitude, the imagination bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lies forth its conceptions unre&s;trained, and &s;tops
<PB N="94" REF="031653_0093_0fed8ebd07308f98">
enraptured to adore the beings of its own crea|tion. The&s;e are moments of bli&s;s; and the memory recalls them with delight.</P>
<P>But I have almo&s;t forgotten the matters of fact I meant to relate, re&s;pecting the counts. They have the pre&s;entation of the livings on their e&s;tates, appoint the judges, and different civil officers, the crown re&s;erving to it&s;elf the privilege of &s;anctioning them. But, though they appoint, they cannot di&s;mi&s;s. Their ten|ants al&s;o occupy their farms for life, and are obliged to obey any &s;ummons to work on the part he re&s;erves for him&s;elf; but they are paid for their labour. In &s;hort, I have &s;eldom heard of any nobleman &s;o innoxious.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erving that the gardens round the count's e&s;tate were better cultivated than any I had be|fore &s;een, I was led to reflect on the advanta|ges which naturally accrue from the feudal ten|ures. The tenants of the count are obliged to work at a &s;tated price, in his grounds and garden; and the in&s;truction which they imper|ceptibly receive from the head gardener, tends to render them u&s;eful, and makes them, in the common cour&s;e of things, better hu&s;bandmen and gardeners on their own little farms. Thus the great, who alone travel, in this period of &s;ociety, for the ob&s;ervation of manners and cu&s;toms made by &s;ailors is very confined, bring home improvement to promote their own com|fort, which is gradually &s;pread abroad among&s;t the people, till they are &s;timulated to think for them&s;elves.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER X.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE once more, my friend, taken flight; for I left Ton&s;berg ye&s;terday: but with an intention of returning, in my way back to Sweden.</P>
<P>The road to Laurvig is very fine, and the country the be&s;t cultivated in Norway. I ne|ver before admired the beech tree; and when I met &s;tragglers here, they plea&s;ed me &s;till le&s;s. Long and lank, they would have forced me to allow that the line of beauty requires &s;ome curves, if the &s;tately pine, &s;tanding near, erect, throwing her va&s;t arms around, had not looked beautiful, in oppo&s;ition to &s;uch narrow rules.</P>
<P>In the&s;e re&s;pects my very rea&s;on obliges me to permit my feelings to be my criterion. Whatever excites emotion has charms for me; though I in&s;i&s;t that the cultivation of the mind, by warming, nay almo&s;t creating the imagina|tion, produces ta&s;te and an immen&s;e variety of &s;en&s;ations and emotions, partaking of the exqui|&s;ite plea&s;ure in&s;pired by beauty and &s;ublimity. As I know of no end to them, the word infi|nite, &s;o often mi&s;applied, might, on this occa&s;ion, be introduced with &s;omething like propriety.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="031653_0100_0fed8f54604c1cb8">But I have rambled away again. I intended to have remarked to you the effect produced by a grove of towering beech. The airy lightne&s;s of their follage admitting a degree of &s;un&s;hine, which, giving a tran&s;parency to the leaves, exhibited an appearance of fre&s;hne&s;s and ele|gance that I had never before remarked. I thought of de&s;criptions of Italian &s;cenery. But the&s;e evane&s;cent graces &s;eemed the effect of en|chantment; and I imperceptibly breathed &s;oft|ly, le&s;t I &s;hould de&s;troy what was real, yet looked &s;o like the creation of fancy. Dryden's fable of the flower and the leaf was not a more poetical reverie.</P>
<P>Adieu, however, to fancy, and to all the &s;entiments which ennoble our nature. I arriv|ed at Laurvig, and found my&s;elf in the mid&s;t of a group of lawyers, of different de&s;criptions. My head turned round, my heart grew &s;ick, as I regarded vi&s;ages deformed by vice; and li&s;tened to accounts of chicanery that were con|tinually embroiling the ignorant. The&s;e locu&s;ts will probably dimini&s;h, as the people become more enlightened. In this period of &s;ocial life the commonalty are always cunningly attentive to their own intere&s;t; but their faculties, con|fined to a few objects, are &s;o narrowed, that they cannot di&s;cover it in the general good. The profe&s;&s;ion of the law renders a &s;et of men &s;till &s;hrewder and more &s;elfi&s;h than the re&s;t; and it is the&s;e men, who&s;e wits have been &s;harpened by knavery, who here undermine morality, confounding right and wrong.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="031653_0101_0fed8f13a35de8c8">The count of Bern&s;torff, who really appears to me, from all I can gather, to have the good of the people at heart, aware of this, has late|ly &s;ent to the mayor of each di&s;trict to name, according to the &s;ize of the place, four or &s;ix of the be&s;t-informed inhabitants, not men of the law, out of which the citizens were to e|lect two, who are to be termed <HI>mediators.</HI> Their office is to endeavour to prevent litigious &s;uits, and conciliate differences.

<P>By the&s;e means ignorant people will be pre|vented from applying for advice to men who may ju&s;tly be termed &s;tirrers-up of &s;trife. They have, for a long time, to u&s;e a &s;ignificant vul|gari&s;m, &s;et the people by the ears, and lived by the &s;poil they caught up in the &s;cramble. There is &s;ome rea&s;on to hope that this regula|tion will dimini&s;h their number, and retrain their mi&s;chievous activity. But till trials by jury are e&s;tabli&s;hed, little ju&s;tice can be expect|ed in Norway. Judges who cannot be bribed are often timid, and afraid of offending bold knaves, le&s;t they &s;hould rai&s;e a &s;et of hornets about them&s;elves. The fear of cen&s;ure under|mines all energy of character; and, labouring to be prudent, they lo&s;e &s;ight of rectitude.

<P><PB N="103" REF="031653_0102_0fed8f58d32035b0">There is a con&s;iderable iron manufactory at Laurvig, for coar&s;e work, and a lake near the town &s;upplies the water nece&s;&s;ary for work|ing &s;everal mills belonging to it.</P>
<P>This e&s;tabli&s;hment belongs to the count of Laurvig. Without a fortune, and influence equal to his, &s;uch a work could not have been &s;et afloat; per&s;onal fortunes are not yet &s;uffici|ent to &s;upport &s;uch undertakings; neverthe|le&s;s the inhabitants of the town &s;peak of the &s;ize of his e&s;tate as an evil, becau&s;e it ob&s;tructs commerce.

Added to this; nature is again&s;t them, the bay being open and in&s;ecure. I could not help &s;miling when I was informed that in a hard gale a ve&s;&s;el had been wrecked in the main &s;treet. When there are &s;uch a number of excellent harbours on the coa&s;t, it is a pity that accident has made one of the large&s;t towns grow up in a bad one.</P>
<P>The father of the pre&s;ent count was a di&s;tant relation of the family; he re&s;ided con&s;tantly in Denmark; and his &s;on follows his example. They have not been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the e&s;tate many years; and their predece&s;&s;or lived near the town, introducing a degree of profligacy of manners which has been ruinous to the in|habitants in every re&s;pect, their fortunes not being equal to the prevailing extravagance.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="031653_0103_0fed8f1547897d38">What little I have &s;een of the manners of the people does not plea&s;e me &s;o well as tho&s;e of Ton&s;berg. I am forewarned that I &s;hall find them &s;till more cunning and fraudulent as I ad|vance towards the we&s;tward, in proportion as traffic takes place of agriculture; for their towns are built on naked rocks: the &s;treets are nar|row bridges; and the inhabitants are all &s;ea|faring men, or owners of &s;hips, who keep &s;hops.</P>
<P>The inn I was at in Laurvig, this journey, was not the &s;ame that I was at before. It is a good one; the people civil, and the accommo|dations decent. They &s;eem to be better provid|ed in Sweden; but in ju&s;tice I ought to add, that they charge more extravagantly. My bill at Ton&s;berg was al&s;o much higher than I had paid in Sweden, and much higher than it ought to have been where provi&s;ions are to cheap. Indeed they &s;eem to con&s;ider foreigners as &s;tran|gers whom they &s;hould never &s;ee again, and might fairly pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ck.

<P>On this journey I was fortunate enough to have one companion with more enlarged views than the generality of his countrymen, who &s;poke engli&s;h tolerably.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="031653_0104_0fed8f5bd8d325f8">I was informed that we might &s;till advance a mile and a quarter in our <HI>cabrioles;</HI> afterwards there was no choice, but of a &s;ingle hor&s;e and wretched path, or a boat, the u&s;ual mode of travelling.</P>
<P>We therefore &s;ent our baggage forward in the boat, and followed rather &s;lowly, for the road was rocky and &s;andy. We pa&s;&s;ed, however, through &s;everal beech groves, which &s;till delighted me by the fre&s;hne&s;s of their light green foliage, and the elegance of their a&s;&s;em|blage, forming retreats to veil, without ob&s;cur|ing the &s;un.</P>
<P>I was &s;urpri&s;ed, at approaching the water, to find a little clu&s;ter of hou&s;es plea&s;antly &s;ituated, and an excellent inn. I could have wi&s;hed to have remained there all night; but as the wind was fair, and the evening fine, I was afraid to tru&s;t to the wind, the uncertain wind of to|morrow.

<P>Though we were in the open &s;ea, we &s;ailed more among&s;t the rocks and i&s;lands than in my pa&s;&s;age from Strom&s;tad; and they often formed very picture&s;que combinations.

<P>One of the i&s;lands, called Virgin Land, is flat, with &s;ome depth of earth, extending for half a norwegian mile, with three farms on it, tolerably well cultivated.</P>

<P>I &s;oon perceived that an experienced mariner was nece&s;&s;ary to guide us; for we were con|tinually obliged to tack about, to avoid the rocks, which, &s;carcely reaching to the &s;urface of the water, could only be di&s;covered by the breaking of the waves over them.</P>
<P>The view of this wild coa&s;t, as we failed a|long it, afforded me a continual &s;ubject for me|ditation.

I anticipated the future improve|ment of the world, and ob&s;erved how much man had &s;till to do, to obtain of the earth all it could yield. I even earned my &s;peculations &s;o far as to advance a million or two of years to the moment when the earth would perhaps be &s;o perfectly cultivated, and &s;o completely peopled, as to render it nece&s;&s;ary to inhabit e|very &s;pot; yes; the&s;e bleak &s;hores. Imagina|tion went &s;till farther, and pictured the &s;tate of man when the earth could no longer &s;up|port him. Where was he to fly to from uni|ver&s;al famine?

Talk not of ba&s;tilles! To be born here, was to be ba&s;tilled by nature&mdash;&s;hut out from all that opens the under&s;tanding, or enlarges the heart. Huddled one behind another, not more than a quarter of the dwellings even had a pro&s;pect of the &s;ea. A few planks formed pa&s;|&s;ages from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, which you mu&s;t often &s;cale, mounting &s;teps like ladder, to en|ter.</P>

<P>I enquired for a walk, and mounting near two hundred &s;teps made round a rock, walked up and down for about a hundred yards, view|ing the &s;ea, to which I quickly de&s;cended by &s;teps that cheated the declivity.

<P>I LEFT Ea&s;t Ru&s;oer the day before ye|&s;terday. The weather was very fine; but &s;o calm that we loitered on the water near fourteen hours, only to make about &s;ix and twenty miles.</P>
<P>It &s;eemed to me a &s;ort of emancipation when we landed at Helgeraac. The confinement which every where &s;truck me whil&s;t &s;ojourning among&s;t the rocks, made me hail the earth as a land of promi&s;e; and the &s;ituation &s;hone with fre&s;h lu&s;tre from the contra&s;t&mdash;from ap|pearing to be a free abode. Here it was po&s;&s;i|ble to travel by land&mdash;I never thought this a comfort before, and my eyes, fatigued by the &s;parkling of the &s;un on the water, now con|tentedly repo&s;ed on the green expan&s;e, half per&s;uaded that &s;uch verdant meads had never till then regaled them.</P>
<P>I ro&s;e early to pur&s;ue my journey to Ton&s;|berg. The country &s;till wore a face of joy&mdash; and my &s;oul was alive to its charms. Leaving the mo&s;t lofty, and romantic of the cliffs behind us, we were almo&s;t continually de&s;cending to Ton&s;berg, through ely&s;ian &s;cenes: for not on|ly the &s;ea, but mountains, rivers, lakes, and
<PB N="119" REF="031653_0118_0fed8f6cae5505e0">
groves, gave an almo&s;t endle&s;s variety to the pro&s;pect. The cottagers were &s;till leading home the bay; and the cottages, on this road, looked very comfortable. Peace and plenty&mdash; I mean not abundance, &s;eemed to reign around &mdash;&s;till I grew &s;ad as I drew near my old abode. I was &s;orry to &s;ee the &s;un &s;o high; it was broad noon. Ton&s;berg was &s;omething like a home&mdash; yet I was to enter without lighting-up plea&s;ure in any eye&mdash;I dreaded the &s;olitarine&s;s of my apartment, and wi&s;hed for night to hide the &s;tarting tears, or to &s;hed them on my pillow, and clo&s;e my eyes on a world where I was de|&s;tined to wander alone. Why has nature &s;o many charms for me&mdash;calling forth and cheri&s;h|ing refined &s;entiments, only to wound the brea&s;t that fo&s;ters them? How illu&s;ive, per|haps the mo&s;t &s;o, are the plans of happine&s;s founder on virtue and principle; what inlets of mi&s;ery do they not open in a half civilized &s;oci|ety? The &s;ati&s;faction ari&s;ing from con&s;cious rectitude, will not calm an injured heart, when tenderne&s;s is ever finding excu&s;es; and &s;elf-ap|plau&s;e is a cold &s;olitary feeling, that cannot &s;upply the place of di&s;appointed affection, with|out throwing a gloom over every pro&s;pect, which, bani&s;hing plea&s;ure, does not exclude pain. I rea&s;oned and rea&s;oned; but my heart was two full to allow me to remain in the hou&s;e, and I walked, till I was wearied out, to purcha&s;e re&s;t&mdash;or rather forgetfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>Employment has beguiled this day, and to|morrow I &s;et out for Mo&s;s, in my way to Strom&s;tad. At Gothenburg I &s;hall embrace my

<P>I LEFT Ton&s;berg ye&s;terday, the 22d of Augu&s;t. It is only twelve or thirteen en|gli&s;h miles to Mo&s;s through a country, le&s;s wild than any tract I had hitherto pa&s;&s;ed over in Norway. It was often beautiful; but &s;el|dom afforded tho&s;e grand views, which fill, ra|ther than &s;ooth the mind.</P>
<P>We glided along the meadows, and through the woods, with &s;un-beams playing around us; and though no ca&s;tles adorned the pro&s;pects, a greater number of comfortable farms met my eyes, during this ride, than I have ever &s;een, in the &s;ame &s;pace, even in the mo&s;t cultivated part of England. And the very appearance of the cottages of the labourers, &s;prinkled amid&s;t them, excluded all tho&s;e gloomy ideas in&s;pired by the contemplation of poverty.</P>
<P>The hay was &s;till bringing in; for one har|ve&s;t in Norway, treads on the heels of the o|ther. The woods were more variegated; in|ter&s;per&s;ed with &s;hrubs. We no longer pa&s;&s;ed through fore&s;ts of va&s;t pines, &s;tretching along with &s;avage magnificence. Fore&s;ts that only exhibited the &s;low decay of time, or the deva&s;|tation produced by warring elements. No;

oaks, a&s;hes, beech; and all the light and grace|ful tenants of our woods here &s;ported luxuriant|ly. I had not ob&s;erved many oaks before; for the greater part of the oak planks, I am inform|ed, come from the we&s;tward.</P>
<P>In France the farmers generally live in vil|lages, which is a great di&s;advantage to the country; but the norwegian farmers, always owning their farms, or being tenants for life, re&s;ide in the mid&s;t of them; allowing &s;ome la|bourers a dwelling, rent free, who have a lit|tle land appertaining to the cottage, not only for a garden, but for crops of different kinds, &s;uch as rye, oats, buck-wheat, hemp, flax, beans, potatoes, and hay, which are &s;own in &s;trips about it; reminding a &s;tranger of the fir&s;t attempts at culture, when every family was ob|liged to be an independent community.</P>
<P>The&s;e cottagers work at a certain price, ten-pence per day, for the farmers on who&s;e ground they live; and they have &s;pare time enough to cultivate their own land; and lay in a &s;tore of fi&s;h for the winter. The wives and daughters &s;pin; and the hu&s;bands and &s;ons weave: &s;o that they may fairly be reckoned independ|ent; having al&s;o a little money in hand to buy coffee, brandy, and &s;ome other &s;uperfluities.</P>
<P>The only thing I di&s;liked was the military &s;ervice, which trammels them more than I at fir&s;t imagined. It is true that the militia is only called out once a year&mdash;yet, in ca&s;e of war, they have no alternative, but mu&s;t aban|don

their families. Even the manufacturers are not exempted, though the miners are, in order to encourage undertakings which require a capital at the commencement. And what appears more tyrannical, the inhabitants of cer|tain di&s;tricts are appointed for the land, others for the &s;ea &s;ervice. Con&s;equently, a pea&s;ant, born a &s;oldier, is not permitted to follow his in|clination, &s;hould it lead him to go to &s;ea: a natural de&s;ire near &s;o many &s;ea ports.</P>
<P>In the&s;e regulations the arbitrary govern|ment, the king of Denmark being the mo&s;t ab|&s;olute monarch in Europe, appears, which in other re&s;pects, &s;eeks to hide it&s;elf in a lenity that almo&s;t renders the laws nullities. If any alteration of old cu&s;toms is thought of, the o|pinion of the whole country is required, and maturely con&s;idered. I have &s;everal times had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, that fearing to appear ty|rannical, laws, are allowed to become ob&s;olete, which ought to be put in force, or better &s;ub|&s;tituted in their &s;tead; for this mi&s;taken mo|deration, which borders on timidity, favours the lea&s;t re&s;pectable part of the people.</P>
<P>I &s;aw on my way not only good par&s;onage hou&s;es, but comfortable dwellings, with glebe land for the clerk: always a con&s;equential man in every country: a being proud of a little &s;mattering of learning, to u&s;e the appropriate epithet, and vain of the &s;tiff good-breeding re|flected from the vicar; though the &s;ervility practi&s;ed in his company gives it a peculiar ca&s;t.</P>

The appearance of the circumjacent country had been preparing me for the change of &s;cene, which was to greet me, when I reached the coa&s;t.

The new&s;papers printed at Copenha|gen, as well as tho&s;e in England, give the mo&s;t exaggerated accounts of their atrocities and di&s;|tre&s;&s;es; but the former without any apparent comments or inferences. Still the norwegians, though more connected with the engli&s;h, &s;peak|ing their language, and copying their man|ners, wi&s;h well to the republican cau&s;e, and follow, with the mo&s;t lively intere&s;t, the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es of the french arms. So determined were they, in fact, to excu&s;e every thing, di&s;grac|ing the &s;truggle of freedom, by admiting the
<PB N="127" REF="031653_0126_0fed8f7736a545e8">
tyrant's plea nece&s;&s;ity, that I could hardly per|&s;uade them that Robe&s;pierre was a mon&s;ter.</P>
<P>The di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this &s;ubject is not &s;o gene|ral as in England, being confined to the few, the clergy and phy&s;ician, with a &s;mall portion of people who have a literary turn and lei&s;ure: the greater part of the inhabitants, having a variety of occupations, being owners of &s;hips, &s;hopkeepers and farmers, have employment enough at home. And their ambition to be|come rich may tend to cultivate the common &s;en&s;e, which characterizes and narrows both their hearts and views; confining the former to their families, taking the <HI>handmaids</HI> of it in|to the circle of plea&s;ure, if not of intere&s;t; and the latter to the in&s;pection of their workmen, including the noble &s;cience of bargain-making &mdash;that is getting every thing at the cheape&s;t, and &s;elling it at the deare&s;t rate. I am now more than ever convinced, that it is an inter|cour&s;e with men of &s;cience and arti&s;ts, which not only diffu&s;es ta&s;te, but gives that freedom to the under&s;tanding, without which I have &s;eldom met with much benevolence of character, on a large &s;cale.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides though you do not hear of much pilfering and &s;tealing in Norway, yet they will, with a quiet con&s;cience, buy things at a price which mu&s;t convince them they were &s;tolen. I had an opportunity of knowing that two or three reputable people had purcha&s;ed &s;ome articles of vagrants, who were detected. How much of the virtue, which appears in the world,
<PB N="128" REF="031653_0127_0fed8f38c366ae88">
is put on for the world! And how little dictat|ed by &s;elf re&s;pect&mdash;&s;o little, that I am ready to repeat the old que&s;tion&mdash;and a&s;k, where is truth or rather principle to be found? The&s;e are, perhaps, the vapourings of a heart ill at ea&s;e&mdash;the effu&s;ions of a &s;en&s;ibility wounded al|mo&s;t to madne&s;s. But enough of this&mdash;we will di&s;cu&s;s the &s;ubject in another &s;tate of ex|i&s;tence&mdash;where truth and ju&s;tice will reign. How cruel are the injuries which make us quar|rel with human nature!&mdash;At pre&s;ent black me|lancholy hovers round my foot&s;teps; and &s;or|row &s;heds a mildew over all the future pro&s;|pects, which hope no longer gilds.</P>
<P>A rainy morning prevented my enjoying the plea&s;ure the view of a picture&s;que coun|try would have afforded me; for though this road pa&s;&s;ed through a country, a greater ex|tent of which was under cultivation, than I had u&s;ually &s;een here, it neverthele&s;s retained all the wild charms of Norway. Rocks &s;till enclo&s;ed the valleys, who&s;e grey &s;ides enli|vened their verdure. Lakes appeared like branches of the &s;ea, and branches of the &s;ea a&s;&s;umed the appearance of tranquil lakes; whil&s;t &s;treamlets prattled among&s;t the pebbles, and the broken ma&s;s of &s;tone which had rol|led into them; giving fanta&s;tic turns to the trees who&s;e roots they bared.</P>
<P>It is not, in fact, &s;upri&s;ing that the pine &s;hould be often undermined, if &s;hoots its fibres in &s;uch an horizontal direction, merely on the &s;urface of the earth, requiring only enough to
<PB N="129" REF="031653_0128_0fed8f78d8af7540">
cover tho&s;e that cling to the craggs. Nothing proves to me, &s;o clearly, that it is the air which principally nouri&s;hes trees and plants, as the flouri&s;hing appearance of the&s;e pines.&mdash; The firs demanding a deeper &s;oil, are &s;eldom &s;een in equal health, or &s;o numerous on the barren cliffs. They take &s;helter in the crevices, or where, after &s;ome revolving ages, the pines have prepared them a footing.</P>
<P>Approaching, or rather de&s;cending, to Chri&s;tiania, though the weather continued a little cloudy, my eyes were charmed with the view of an exten&s;ive undulated valley, &s;tretch|ing out under the &s;helter of a noble amphithea|tre of pine-covered mountains. Farm hou&s;es &s;cattered about animated, nay, graced a &s;cene which &s;till retained &s;o much of its native wild|ne&s;s, that the art which appeared, &s;eemed &s;o nece&s;&s;ary it was &s;carcely perceived. Cattle were grazing in the &s;haven meadows; and the lively green, on their &s;welling &s;ides, contra&s;t|ed with the ripening corn and rye. The corn that grew on the &s;lopes, had not, indeed, the laughing luxuriance of plenty, which I have &s;een in more genial climes. A fre&s;h breeze &s;wept acro&s;s the grain, parting its &s;lender &s;talks; but the wheat did not wave its head with its wonted, carele&s;s dignity, as if nature had crowned it the king of plants.</P>
<P>The view, immediately on the left, as we drove down the mountain, was almo&s;t &s;poilt by the depredations committed on the rocks to make alum. I do not know the proce&s;s.&mdash;I
<PB N="130" REF="031653_0129_0fed902fc7cf8eb8">
only &s;aw that the rocks looked red after they had been burnt; and regretted that the opera|tion &s;hould leave a quantity of rubbi&s;h, to in|troduce an image of human indu&s;try in the &s;hape of de&s;truction. The &s;ituation of Chri&s;|tiania is certainly uncommonly fine; and I never &s;aw a bay that &s;o forcibly gave me an idea of a place of &s;afety from the &s;torms of the ocean&mdash;all the &s;orrounding objects were beau|tiful, and even grand. But neither the rocky mountains, nor the woods that graced them, could be compared with the &s;ublime pro&s;pects I had &s;een towards the we&s;tward; and as for the hills, "capped with <HI>eternal</HI> &s;now," Mr. Coxe's de&s;cription led me to look for them; but they had flown; for I looked vainly around for this noble back-ground,</P>
<P>A few months ago the people of Chri&s;tiania ro&s;e, exa&s;perated by the &s;carcity, and con&s;e|quent high price of grain. The immediate cau&s;e was the &s;hipping of &s;ome, &s;aid to be for Mo&s;s; but which they &s;u&s;pected was only a pretext to &s;end it out of the country: and I am not &s;ure that they were wrong in their conjec|ture.&mdash;Such are the tricks of trade! They threw &s;tones at Mr. Anker, the owner of it, as he rode out of town to e&s;cape from their fu|ry; they a&s;&s;embled about his hou&s;e. And the people demanded afterwards, with &s;o much impetuo&s;ity, the liberty of tho&s;e who were ta|ken up in con&s;equence of the tumult, that the Grand Bailiff thought it prudent to relea&s;e them without further altercation.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="031653_0130_0fed8f7a768876e8">You may think me too &s;evere on commerce; but from the manner it is at pre&s;ent carried on, little can be advanced in favour of a pur&s;uit that wears out the mo&s;t &s;acred principles of humani|ty and rectitude. What is &s;peculation, but a &s;pecies of gambling, I might have &s;aid fraud, in which addre&s;s generally gains the prize?

<P>At Chri&s;tiania I met with that polite recep|tion, which rather characteri&s;es the progre&s;s of manners in the world, than of any particular portion of it. The fir&s;t evening of my arrival I &s;upped with &s;ome of the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable peo|ple of the place; and almo&s;t imagined my&s;elf

in a circle of engli&s;h ladies, &s;o much did they re&s;emble them in manners, dre&s;s, and even in beauty; for the faire&s;t of my country women would not have been &s;orry to rank with the Grand Bailiff's lady. There were &s;everal pret|ty girls pre&s;ent, but &s;he out&s;hone them all; and what intere&s;ted me &s;till more, I could not avoid ob&s;erving that in acquiring the ea&s;y po|litene&s;s which di&s;tingui&s;hes people of quality, &s;he had pre&s;erved her norwegian &s;implicity. There was, in fact, a graceful timidity in her addre&s;s, inexpre&s;&s;ibly charming. This &s;urpri&s;ed me a little, becau&s;e her hu&s;band was quite a frenchman of the <HI>ancien regime,</HI> or rather a courtier, the &s;ame kind of animal in every country.</P>
<P>Here I &s;aw the cloven foot of de&s;poti&s;m. I boa&s;ted, to you, that they had no viceroy in Norway; but the&s;e grand bailiffs, particularly the &s;uperior one, who re&s;ides at Chri&s;tiania, are political mon&s;ters of the &s;ame &s;pecies. Nee|dy &s;ycophants are provided for by their relati|ons and connexions at Copenhagen, as at other courts. And though the norwegians are not in the abject &s;tate of the iri&s;h, yet this &s;econd|hand government is &s;till felt by their being de|prived of &s;everal natural advantages to benefit the domineering &s;tate.</P>
<P>The grand bailiffs are mo&s;tly noblemen from Copenhagen, who act as men of common minds will always act in &s;uch &s;ituations&mdash;ap|ing a degree of courtly parade which cla&s;hes with the independent character of a magi&s;trate.
<PB N="133" REF="031653_0132_0fed8f81d27f6d88">
Be&s;ides, they have a degree of power over the country judges, which &s;ome of them who ex|erci&s;e a juri&s;diction truly patriarchal, mo&s;t pain|fully feel. I can &s;carcely &s;ay why&punc; my friend, but in this city, thoughtfulne&s;s &s;eemed to be &s;liding into melancholy, or rather dullne&s;s.&mdash; The fire of fancy, which had been kept alive in the country, was almo&s;t extingui&s;hed by reflections on the ills that hara&s;s &s;uch a large portion of mankind.&mdash;I felt like a bird flutter|ing on the ground unable to mount; yet unwil|ling to crawl tranquilly like a reptile, whil&s;t &s;till con&s;cious it had wings.</P>
<P>I walked out, for the open air is always my remedy when an aching-head proceeds from an oppre&s;&s;ed heart.

<P>I wi&s;hed to have &s;een, through an iron grate, the face of a man who has been con|fined &s;ix years, for having induced the far|mers to revolt again&s;t &s;ome impo&s;itions of the government. I could not obtain a clear ac|count of the affair; yet, as the complaint was again&s;t &s;ome farmers of taxes, I am inclined to beleive, that it was not totally without founda|tion. He mu&s;t have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome eloquence,

<P>The greater number of the &s;laves. I &s;aw here, were not confined for life. Their la|bour is not hard; and they work in the open air, which prevents their con&s;titutions from &s;uffering by impri&s;onment. Still as they are allowed to a&s;&s;ociate together, and boa&s;t of their dexterity, not only to each other but to the &s;oldiers around then, in the garri&s;on, they commonly, it is natural to conclude, go out more confirmed, and more expert knaves than when they entered.</P>
<P>It is not nece&s;&s;ary to trace the origin of the a&s;&s;ociation of ideas, which led me to think that the &s;tars and gold keys, which &s;urrounded me the evening before, di&s;graced the wearers, &s;o much as the fetters I was viewing&mdash;perhaps more. I even began to inve&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gate the rea&s;on which led me to &s;u&s;pect that the former produ|ced the latter.</P>
<P>The norwegians are extravagantly fond of courtly di&s;tinction, and of titles, though they
<PB N="135" REF="031653_0134_0fed8f836f27fdb0">
have no immunities annexed to them, and are ea&s;ily purcha&s;ed. The proprietors of mines have many privileges: they are almo&s;t exempt from taxes, and the pea&s;antry born on their e|&s;tates, as well as tho&s;e on the count's, are not born &s;oldiers or &s;ailors.</P>
<P>One di&s;tinction, or rather trophy of nobili|ty, which might have occured to the Hotten|tots, amu&s;ed me; it was a bunch of hog's bri&s;|tles placed on the hor&s;es' heads; &s;urmounting that part of the harne&s;s to which a round piece of bra&s;s often dangles, fatiguing the eye with its idle motion.</P>
<P>From the fortre&s;s I returned to my lodging, and quickly was taken out of town to be &s;hewn a pretty villa, and engli&s;h garden. To a nor|wegian both might have been objects of curio&s;i|ty, and of u&s;e, by exciting to the compari&s;on which leads to improvement. But whil&s;t I gazed, I was employed in re&s;toring the place to nature, or ta&s;te, by giving it the character of the &s;urrounding &s;cene. Serpentine walks, and flowering &s;hrubs, looked trifling in a grand re|ce&s;s of the rocks, &s;haded by towering pines. Groves of le&s;&s;er trees might have been &s;heltered under them, which would have melted into the land&s;cape, di&s;playing only the art which ought to point out the vicinity of a human abode, fur|ni&s;hed with &s;ome elegance.

<P>CHRISTIANIA is a clean, neat city; but it has none of the graces of architecture, which ought to keep pace with the refining manners of a people&mdash; or the out&s;ide of the hou&s;e will di&s;grace the in&s;ide; giving the be|holder an idea of overgrown wealth devoid of ta&s;te. Large &s;quare wooden hou&s;es offend the eye, di&s;playing more than gothic barbari&s;m. Huge gothic piles, indeed, exhibit a character|i&s;tic &s;ublimity, and a wildne&s;s of fancy peculiar to the period when they were erected; but &s;ize, without grandeur or elegance, has an emphatical &s;tamp of meanne&s;s, of poverty of conception, which only a commercial &s;pirit could give.</P>
<P>The &s;ame thought has &s;truck me, when I have entered the meeting-hou&s;e of my re&s;pected friend, Dr. Price. I am &s;urpri&s;ed that the di&s;&s;enters, who have not laid a&s;ide all the pomps and vanities of life, &s;hould imagine a noble pillar, or arch, unhallowed. Whil&s;t men have &s;en&s;es, whatever &s;ooths them lends wings to devotion; el&s;e why do the beauties of nature, where all that charm them are &s;pread around with a lavi&s;h hand, force even the &s;or|rowing heart to acknowledge that exi&s;tence is
<PB N="138" REF="031653_0137_0fed8f44e2a37268">
a ble&s;&s;ing; and this acknowledgement is the mo&s;t &s;ublime homage we can pay to the Deity.</P>
<P>The argument of convenience is ab&s;urd. Who would labour for wealth, if it were to procure nothing but conveniences? If we wi&s;h to render mankind moral from principle, we mu&s;t, I am per&s;uaded, give a greater &s;cope to the enjoyments of the &s;en&s;es, by blending ta&s;te with them. This has frequently occurred to me &s;ince I have been in the north, and ob&s;erv|ed that their &s;anguine characters always take refuge in drunkenne&s;s after the fire of youth is &s;pent.</P>
<P>But I have flown from Norway, to go back to the wooden hou&s;es. Farms con&s;tructed with logs, and even little villages, here erected in the &s;ame &s;imple manner, have appeared to me very picture&s;que. In the more remote parts I had been particularly plea&s;ed with many cotta|ges &s;ituated clo&s;e to a brook, or bordering on a lake, with the whole farm contiguous. As the family increa&s;es, a little more land is cultivated: thus the country obviou&s;ly enriched by popu|lation. Formerly the farmers might more ju&s;t|ly have been termed wood-cutters. But now they find it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;pare the woods a lit|tle; and this change will be univer&s;ally benefi|cial; for whil&s;t they lived entirely by &s;elling the trees they felled, they did not pay &s;uffi|cient attention to hu&s;bandry; con&s;equently, advanced very &s;lowly in agricultural know|ledge. Nece&s;&s;ity will in future more and more &s;pur them on; for the ground, cleared of

<P>The people of property are very careful of their timber; and, rambling through a fore&s;t near Ton&s;berg, belonging to the count, I have &s;topt to admire the appearance of &s;ome of the cottages inhabited by a woodman's family&mdash;a man employed to cut down the wood nece&s;&s;ary for the hou&s;hold and the e&s;tate. A little lawn was cleared, on which &s;everal lofty trees were left which nature had grouped, whil&s;t the en|circling firs &s;ported with wild grace. The dwelling was &s;heltered by the fore&s;t, noble pines &s;preading their branches over the roof; and before the door a cow, goat, nag, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d children, &s;eemed equally content with their lot; and if contentment be all we can attain, it is, perhaps, be&s;t &s;ecured by ignorance.</P>
<P>As I have been mo&s;t delighted with the country parts of Norway, I was &s;orry to leave Chri&s;tiania, without going further to the north, though the advancing &s;ea&s;on admoni&s;hed me to depart, as well as the calls of bu&s;ine&s;s and af|fection.</P>

<P>A law in Norway, termed the <HI>odels right,</HI> has lately been modified, and probably will be aboli&s;hed as an impediment to commerce. The heir of an e&s;tate had the power of repurcha&s;ing it at the original purcha&s;e money, making al|lowance for &s;uch improvements as were ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary, during the &s;pace of twenty years. At pre&s;ent ten is the term allowed for after thought; and when the regulation was made, all the men of abilities were invited to give their opinion whether it were better to abrogate or modify it. It is certainly a conve|nient and &s;afe way of mortgaging land; yet the mo&s;t rational men, whom I conver&s;ed with on the &s;ubject, &s;eemed convinced that the right was more injurious than beneficial to &s;o|ciety; &s;till if it contribute to keep the farms in the farmers own hands, I &s;hould be &s;orry to hear that it were aboli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The arictocracy in Norway, if we keep clear of Chri&s;tiania, is far from being formidable; and it will require a long time to enable the merchants to attain a &s;ufficient monied intere&s;t to induce them to reinforce the upper cla&s;s, at the expence of the yeomanry, with whom they are u&s;ually connected.</P>

<P>I LEFT Chri&s;tiania ye&s;terday. The wea|ther was not very fine; and having been a little delayed on the road, I found that it was too late to go round, a couple of miles, to &s;ee the ca&s;cade near Frederic&s;tadt, which I had determined to vi&s;it. Be&s;ides, as Frederic&s;tadt is a fortre&s;s, it was nece&s;&s;ary to arrive there before they &s;hut the gate.</P>
<P>The road along the river is very romantic, though the views are not very grand; and the riches of Norway, its timber, floats &s;ilently down the &s;tream, often impeded in its cour&s;e by i&s;lands and little cataracts, the offspring, as it were, of the great one I had frequently heard de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>I found an excellent inn at Frederic&s;tadt, and was gratified by the kind attention of the ho&s;|te&s;s, who, perceiving that my clothes were wet, took great pains to procure me, as a &s;tranger, every co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for the night.</P>
<P>It had rained very hard; and we pa&s;&s;ed the ferry in the dark, without getting out of our carriage, which I think wrong, as the hor&s;es are &s;ometimes unrully. Fatigue and melane|choly,

however, had made me regardle&s;s whe|ther I went down or acro&s;s the &s;tream; and I did not know that I was wet before the ho&s;te&s;s remarked it. My imagination has never yet &s;evered me from my griefs&mdash;and my mind has &s;eldom been &s;o free as to allow my body to be delicate.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>When the mind's free,</L><L>The body's delicate.</L><BIBL>Vid. King Lear.</BIBL></Q></NOTE></P>
<P>How I am altered by di&s;appointment!&mdash; When going to Li&s;bon, the ela&s;ticity of my mind was &s;ufficient to ward of wearine&s;s, and my imagination &s;till could dip her bru&s;h in the rainbow of fancy, and &s;ketch futurity in glowing colours. Now&mdash;but let me talk of &s;omething el&s;e&mdash;will you go with me to the ca&s;cade?</P>
<P>The cro&s;s road to it was rugged and dreary; and though a con&s;iderable extent of land was cultivated on all &s;ides, yet the rocks were entirely bare, which &s;urpri&s;ed me, as they were more on a level with the &s;urface than any I had yet &s;een. On enquiry, however, I learnt that &s;ome years &s;ince a fore&s;t had been burnt. This appearance of de&s;olation was be|yond mea&s;ure gloomy, in&s;piring emotions that &s;terility had never produced. Fires of this kind are occa&s;ioned by the wind &s;uddenly ri&s;ing when the farmers are burning roots of trees, &s;talks of beans, &amp;c. with which they manure
<PB N="145" REF="031653_0144_0fed8f8f9c4941b8">
the ground. The deva&s;tation mu&s;t, indeed, be terrible, when this, literally &s;peaking, wild fire, runs along the fore&s;t, flying from top to top, and crackling among&s;t the branches. The &s;oil, as well as the trees, is &s;wept away by the de&s;tructive torrent; and the country, de&s;poil|ed of beauty and riches, is left to mourn for ages.</P>
<P>Admiring, as I do, the&s;e noble fore&s;ts, which &s;eem to bid defiance to time, I looked with pain on the ridge of rocks that &s;tretched far beyond my eye, formerly crowned with the mo&s;t beautiful verdure.</P>
<P>I have often mentioned the grandeur, but I feel my&s;elf unequal to the ta&s;k of conveying an idea of the beauty and elegance of the &s;cene when the &s;piral tops of the pines are loaded with ripening &s;eed, and the &s;un gives a glow to their light green tinge, which is changing into purple, one tree more or le&s;s advanced, contra&s;ting with another. The profu&s;ion with which nature has decked them, with pendant honours, prevents all &s;urpri&s;e at &s;eeing, in e|very crevice, &s;ome &s;apling &s;truggling for exi&s;t|ence. Va&s;t ma&s;&s;es of &s;tone are thus encircled; and roots, torn up by the &s;torms, become a &s;helter for a young generation. The pine and fir woods, left entirely to nature, di&s;play an endle&s;s variety; and the paths in the wood are not entangled with fallen leaves, which are only intere&s;ting whil&s;t they are fluttering be|tween life and death. The grey cobweb-like appearance of the aged pines, is a much finer
<PB N="146" REF="031653_0145_0fed8f4fb1ea5db8">
image of decay; the fibres whitening as they lo&s;e their moi&s;ture, impri&s;oned life &s;eems to be &s;tealing away. I cannot tell why&mdash;but death, under every form, appears to me like &s;ome|thing getting free&mdash;to expand in I know not what element; nay I feel that this con&s;cious being mu&s;t be as unfettered, have the wings of thought, before it can be happy.</P>
<P>Reaching the ca&s;cade, or rather cataract, the roaring of which had a long time announ|ced its vicinity, my &s;oul was hurried by the falls into a new train of reflections. The impetuous da&s;hing of the rebounding torrent from the dark cavities which mocked the ex|ploring eye, produced an equal activity in my mind: my thoughts darted from earth to hea|ven, and I a&s;ked my&s;elf why I was chained to life and its mi&s;ery? Still the tumultuous emoti|ons this &s;ublime object excited, were plea&s;ura|ble; and, viewing it, my &s;oul ro&s;e, with re|newed dignity, above its cares&mdash;gra&s;ping at immortality&mdash;it &s;eemed as impo&s;&s;ible to &s;top the current of my thoughts, as of the always vary|ing, &s;till the &s;ame, torrent before me&mdash;I &s;tretch|ed out my hand to eternity, bounding over the dark &s;peak of life to come.</P>
<P>We turned with regret from the ca&s;cade. On a little hill, which commands the be&s;t view of it, &s;everal obeli&s;ks are erected to com|memorate the vi&s;its of different kings. The appearance of the river above and below the falls is very picture&s;que, the ruggedne&s;s of the &s;cenery di&s;appearing as the torrent &s;ub&s;ides
<PB N="147" REF="031653_0146_0fed8f9140258190">
into a peaceful &s;tream. But I did not like to &s;ee a number of &s;aw-mills crowded together clo&s;e to the cataracts; they de&s;troyed the har|mony of the pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>The &s;ight of a bridge erected acro&s;s a deep valley, at a little di&s;tance, in&s;pired very di&s;|&s;imilar &s;en&s;ations. It was almo&s;t ingeniou&s;ly &s;upported by ma&s;t-like trunks, ju&s;t &s;tript of their branches; and logs, placed one acro&s;s the other, produced an appearance equally light and firm, &s;eeming almo&s;t to be built in the air when we were below it; the height taking from the magnitude of the &s;upporting trees give them a &s;lender, graceful look.</P>
<P>There are two noble e&s;tates in this neigh|bourhood, the proprietors of which &s;eem to have caught more than their portion of the enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit that is gone abroad. Many agricultural experiments have been made; an the country appears better enclo&s;ed and cultivated; yet the cottages had not the com|fortable a&s;pect of tho&s;e I had ob&s;erved near Mo&s;s, and to the we&s;tward. Man is always deba&s;ed by &s;ervitude, of any de&s;cription; and here the pea&s;antry are not entirely free.</P>

<P>I SET out from Frederic&s;tadt about three o'clock in the afternoon, and expected to reach Strom&s;tad before the night clo&s;ed in; but the wind dying away, the weather became &s;o calm, that we &s;carcely made any perceptible advances towards the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t, though the men were fatigued with rowing.</P>
<P>Getting among&s;t the rocks and i&s;lands as the moon ro&s;e, and the &s;tars darted forward out of the clear expan&s;e. I forgot that the night &s;tole on, whil&s;t indulging affectionate reveries, the poetical fictions of &s;en&s;ibility: I was not, there|fore, aware of the length of time we had been toiling to reach Strom&s;tadt. And when I be|gan to look around, I did not perceive any thing to indicate that we were in its neighbour|hood. So far from it, that when I inquired of the pilot, who &s;poke a little engli&s;h, I found that he was only accu&s;tomed to coa&s;t along the norwegian &s;hore; and had been, only once, acro&s;s to Strom&s;tad. But he had brought with him a fellow better acquainted, he a&s;&s;ured me, with the rocks by which they were to &s;teer our cour&s;e; for he had not a compa&s;s on board; yet, as he was half a fool, I had little confi|dence in his &s;kill There was then great rea|&s;on
<PB N="150" REF="031653_0149_0fed8f98c12af340">
to fear that we had lo&s;t our way, and were &s;traying amid&s;t a labyrinth of rocks, without a clue.</P>
<P>This was &s;omething like an adventurer; but not of the mo&s;t agreaable ca&s;t; be&s;ides, I was impatient to arrive at Strom&s;tad, to be able to &s;end forward, that night, a boy to order hor|&s;es on the road to be ready; for I was unwil|ling to remain there a day, without having any thing to detain me from my little girl; and from the letters which I was impatient to get from you.</P>
<P>I began to expo&s;tulate, and even to &s;cold the pilot, for not having informed me of his igno|rance, previous to my departure. This made him row with more force; and we turned round one rock only to &s;ee another, equally de&s;titute of the tokens we were in &s;earch of to tell us where we were. Entering al&s;o into creek af|ter creek, which promi&s;ed to be the entrance of the bay we were &s;eeking, we advanced mere|ly to find our&s;elves running aground.</P>
<P>The &s;olitarine&s;s of the &s;cene, as we glided under the dark &s;hadows of the rocks, plea&s;ed me for a while; but the fear of pa&s;&s;ing the whole night thus wandering to and fro, and lo&s;ing the next day, rou&s;ed me. I begged the pilot to return to one of the large&s;t i&s;lands, at the &s;ide of which we had &s;een a boat moored. As we drew nearer, a light through a window on the &s;ummit, became our beacon; but we were farther off than I &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="031653_0150_0fed8fe50fa83978">With &s;ome difficulty the pilot got on &s;hore, not di&s;tingui&s;hing the landing place; and I re|mained in the boat, knowing that all the relief we could expect, was a man to direct us. Af|ter waiting &s;ome time, for there is an in&s;en&s;ibi|lity in the very movements of the&s;e people,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is very po&s;&s;ible that he &s;taid to &s;moke a pipe, though I was waiting in the cold.</NOTE> that would weary more than ordinary patience, he brought with him a man, who a&s;&s;i&s;ting them to row, we landed at Strom&s;tad a little af|ter one in the morning.</P>
<P>It was too late to &s;end off a boy; but I did not go to bed before I had made the arrange|ments nece&s;&s;ary to enable me to &s;et out as early as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The &s;un ro&s;e with &s;plendor. My mind was too active to allow me to loiter long in bed, though the hor&s;es did not arrive till between &s;e|ven and eight. However, as I wi&s;hed to let the boy, who went forward to order the hor|&s;es, get con&s;iderably the &s;tart of me, I briddled|in my impatience.</P>
<P>This precaution was unavailing, for after the three fir&s;t po&s;ts, I had to wait two hours, whil&s;t the people at the po&s;t-hou&s;e went, fair and &s;oft|ly, to the farm, to bid them bring up the hor|&s;es, which were carrying in the fir&s;t fruits of the harve&s;t. I di&s;covered here that the&s;e &s;lug|gi&s;h pea&s;ants had their &s;hare of cunning. Though they had made me pay for a hor&s;e, the boy had
<PB N="152" REF="031653_0151_0fed8f9bc9844f50">
gone on foot, and only arrived half an hour be|fore me. This di&s;concerted the whole arrange|ment of the day; and being detained again three hours, I reluctantly determined to &s;leep at Qui&s;tram, two po&s;ts &s;hort of Uddervalla, where I had hoped to have arrived that night.</P>
<P>But, when I reached Qui&s;tram, I found I could not approach the door of the inn, for men, hor&s;es, and carts, cows, and pigs hud|dled together. From the con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters">e of people, I had met on the road, I conjectured that there was a fair in the neighbourhood, this crowd convinced me that it was but too true. The boi&s;terous merriment that almo&s;t every in&s;tant produced a quarrel or made me dread one, with the clouds of tobacco, and fumes of brandy, gave an infernal appearance to the &s;cene. There was every thing to drive me back, nothing to excite &s;ympathy in a rude tumult of the &s;en&s;es, which I fore&s;aw would end in a gro&s;s debauch. What was to be done? No bed was to be had, or even a quiet corner to retire to for a moment &mdash;all was lo&s;t in noi&s;e, riot, and confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>After &s;ome debating they promi&s;ed me hor&s;es, which were to go on to Uddervalla, two &s;tages. I reque&s;ted &s;omething to eat fir&s;t, not having dined; and the ho&s;te&s;s, whom I have mentioned to you before, as knowing how to take care of her&s;elf, brought me a plate of fi&s;h, for which &s;he charged a rix dollar and a half. This was making hay whil&s;t the &s;un &s;hone. I was glad to get out of the uproar, though not di&s;po&s;ed to travel in an incommodious open
<PB N="153" REF="031653_0152_0fed8fe6ae931c68">
carriage all night, had I thought that there was any chance of getting hor&s;es.</P>
<P>Quitting Qui&s;tram, I met a number of joy|ous groups, and though the evening was fre&s;h, many were &s;tretched on the gra&s;s like weary cattle; and drunken men had fallen by the road &s;ide. On a rock, under the &s;hade of lofty trees, a large party of men and women had lighted a fire, cutting down fuel around to keep it alive all night. They were drinking, &s;moaking, and laughing, with all their might and main. I felt for the trees who&s;e torn branches &s;trewed the ground.&mdash;Haple&s;s nymphs! thy haunts I fear were polluted by many an unhallowed flame; the ca&s;ual bur&s;t of the moment.</P>
<P>The hor&s;es went on very well; but when we drew near the po&s;t-hou&s;e, the po&s;tilion &s;topt &s;hort, and neither threats, nor promi&s;es, could prevail on him to go forward. He even began to howl and weep, when I in&s;i&s;ted on his keep|ing his word. Nothing, indeed, can equal the &s;tupid ob&s;tinacy of &s;ome of the&s;e half alive beings, who &s;eem to have been made by Prome|theus, when the fire he &s;tole from Heaven was &s;o exhau&s;ted, that he could only &s;pare a &s;park to give life, not animation, to the inert clay.</P>
<P>It was &s;ome time before we could rou&s;e any body; and, as I expected, hor&s;es we were told could not be had in le&s;s than four or five hours. I again attempted to bribe the churli&s;h brute, who brought us there; but I
<PB N="154" REF="031653_0153_0fed8f9d67559098">
di&s;covered, that in &s;pite of the courteous ho|&s;te&s;s's promi&s;e, he had received orders not to go any farther.</P>
<P>As there was no remedy I entered, and was almo&s;t driven back by the &s;tench&mdash;a &s;ofter phra&s;e would not have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">aveyed an idea of the hot vapour that i&s;&s;ued from an apartment in which &s;ome eight or ten people were &s;leeping, not to reckon the cats and dogs &s;tretched on the floor. Two or three of the men or women were lying on the benches, others on old che&s;ts; and one figure &s;tarted half out of a trunk to look at me, whom I might have taken for a gho&s;t, had the <HI>chemi&s;e</HI> been white, to contra&s;t with the &s;allow vi&s;age. But the <HI>co&s;|tume</HI> of apparitions not being pre&s;erved I pa&s;&s;|ed, nothing dreading, excepting the effluvia, warily among&s;t the pots, pans, milk-pails, and wa&s;hing tubs. After &s;caling a ruinous &s;tairca&s;e, I was &s;hewn a bed-chamber. The bed did not invite me to enter; opening, therefore, the window, and taking &s;ome clean towels out of my night-&s;ack, I &s;pread them over the cover|lid, on which tired nature found repo&s;e, in &s;pite of the previous di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>With the grey of the morn the birds awoke me; and de&s;cending to enquire for the hor&s;es, I ha&s;tened through the apartment, I have al|ready de&s;cribed, not wi&s;hing to a&s;&s;ociate the idea of a pig&s;tye with that of a human dwell|ing.</P>
<P>I do not wonder that the girls lo&s;e their fine

complexions at &s;uch an early age, or that love here is merely an appetite, to fulfil the main de&s;ign of nature, never enlivened by either af|fection or &s;entiment.</P>
<P>For a few po&s;ts we found the hor&s;es waiting; but afterwards I was retarded, as before, by the pea&s;ants, who, taking advantage of my ignorance of the language, made me pay for the fourth hor&s;e, that ought to have gone for|ward to have the other in readine&s;s, though it had never been &s;ent. I was particularly im+patient at the la&s;t po&s;t, as I longed to a&s;&s;ure my|&s;elf that my child was well.</P>
<P>My impatience, however, did not prevent my enjoying the journey. I had &s;ix weeks before pa&s;&s;ed over the &s;ame ground, &s;till it had &s;ufficient novelty to attract my attention, and beguile, if not bani&s;h, the &s;orrow that had ta|ken up its abode in my heart. How intere&s;t|ing are the varied beauties of nature; and what peculiar charms characterize each &s;ea&s;on! The purple hue which the heath now a&s;&s;umed, gave it a degree of richne&s;s, that almo&s;t exceed|ed the lu&s;tre of the young green of &s;pring&mdash; and harmonized exqui&s;itely with the rays of the ripening corn. The weather was uninter|ruptedly fine, and the people bu&s;y in the fields cutting down the corn, or binding up the &s;heaves, continually varied the pro&s;pect. The rocks, it is true, were unu&s;ually rugged and dreary, yet as the road runs for a con&s;iderable way by the &s;ide of a fine river, with extended pa&s;tures on the other &s;ide, the image of &s;terility

was not the predominant object, though the cottages looked &s;till more mi&s;erable, after hav|ing &s;een the norwegian farms. The trees, like|wi&s;e, appeared of the growth of ye&s;terday, compared with tho&s;e Ne&s;tors of the fore&s;t I have frequently mentioned. The women and children were cutting off branches from the beech, birch, oak, &amp;c, and leaving them to dry&mdash;This way of helping out their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">odder, injures the trees. But the winters are &s;o long, that the poor cannot afford to lay in a &s;ufficient &s;tock of hay. By &s;uch means they ju&s;t keep life in the poor cows, for little milk can be ex|pected when they are &s;o mi&s;erably fed.</P>
<P>It was &s;aturday, and the evening was un|commonly &s;erene. In the villages I every where &s;aw preparations for &s;unday; and I pa&s;&s;ed by a little car loaded with rye, that pre|&s;ented, for the pencil and heart, the &s;weete&s;t picture of a harve&s;t home I had ever beheld. A little girl was mounted a &s;traddle on a &s;hag|gy hor&s;e, brandi&s;hing a &s;tick over its head; the father was walking at the &s;ide of the car with a child in his arms, who mu&s;t have come to meet him with tottering &s;teps, the little crea|ture was &s;tretching out its arms to cling round his neck; and a boy, ju&s;t above petticoats, was labouring hard, with a fork, behind, to keep the &s;heaves from falling.</P>
<P>My eyes followed them to the cottage, and an involuntary &s;igh whi&s;pered to my heart, that I envied the mother, much as I di&s;like cook|ing, who was preparing their pottage. I was
<PB N="157" REF="031653_0157_0fed8fecd0c117d0">
returning to my babe, who may never experi|ence a father's care or tenderne&s;s. The bo&s;om that nurtured her, heaved with a pang at the thought which only an unhappy mother could feel.</P>

<P>I WAS unwilling to leave Gothenburg, without vi&s;iting Trolhaettae. I wi&s;hed not only to &s;ee the ca&s;cade, but to ob&s;erve the progre&s;s of the &s;tupendous attempt to form a canal through the rocks, to the extent of an engli&s;h mile and a half.</P>
<P>This work is carried on by a company who employ daily nine hundred men; five years was the time mentioned in the propo&s;als, ad|dre&s;&s;ed to the public, as nece&s;&s;ary for the com|pletion. A much more con&s;iderable &s;um than the plan requires has been &s;ub&s;cribed, for which there is every rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e the promoters will receive ample intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The Danes &s;urvey the progre&s;s of this work with a jealous eye, as it is principally underta|ked to get clear of the Sound duty.</P>
<P>Arrived at Trolhaettae, I mu&s;t own that the fir&s;t view of the ca&s;cade di&s;appointed me: and the &s;ight of the works, as they advanced, though a grand proof of human indu&s;try, was not calculated to warm the fancy. I, how|ever, wandered about; and at la&s;t coming to the conflux of the various cataracts, ru&s;hing
<PB N="159" REF="031653_0159_0fed8ff2a30fa1b8">
from different falls, &s;truggling with the huge ma&s;&s;es of rocks, and rebounding from the profound cavities, I immediately retracted, acknowledging that it was indeed a grand ob|ject. A little i&s;land &s;tood in the mid&s;t, covered with firs, which, by dividing the torrent, rendered it more picture&s;que; one half ap|pearing to i&s;&s;ue from a dark cavern, that fan|cy might ea&s;ily imagine a va&s;t fountain, throw|ing up its waters from the very centre of the earth.</P>
<P>I gazed I know not how long, &s;tunned with the noi&s;e, and growing giddy with only look|ing at the never-cea&s;ing tumultuous motion, I li&s;tened, &s;carcely con&s;cious where I was, when I ob&s;erved a boy, half ob&s;cured by the &s;park|ling foam, fi&s;hing under the impending rock on the other &s;ide. How he had de&s;cended I could not perceive; nothing like human foot&s;teps ap|peared; and the horrific craggs &s;eemed to bid defiance even to the goat's activity. It looked like an abode only fit for the eagle. though in its crevices &s;ome pines darted up their &s;piral heads; but they only grew near the ca&s;cade: every where el&s;e &s;terility it&s;elf reigned with dreary grandeur; for the hugegrey ma&s;&s;y rocks which probably had been torn a&s;under by &s;ome dreadful convul&s;ion of nature, had not even their fir&s;t covering of a little cleaving mo&s;s. There were &s;o many appearances to excite the idea of chaos, that, in&s;tead of admir|ing the canal and the works, great as they are termed, and little as they appear, I could not help regretting that &s;uch a noble &s;cene had not
<PB N="160" REF="031653_0160_0fed8fa802232e20">
been left in all its &s;olitary &s;ublimity. Amid&s;t the awful roaring of the impetuous torrents, the noi&s;e of human in&s;truments, and the bu&s;tle of workmen, even the blowing up of the rocks, when grand ma&s;&s;es trembled in the darkened air&mdash;only re&s;embled the in&s;ignificant &s;port of children.</P>
<P>One fall of water, partly made by art, when they were attempting to con&s;truct &s;luices, had an uncommonly grand effect; the water precipitated it&s;elf with immen&s;e velocity down a perpendicular, at lea&s;t fifty or &s;ixty yards, into a gulph, &s;o concealed by the foam as to give full play to the fancy: there was a con|tinual uproar: I &s;tood on a rock to ob&s;erve it, a kind of bridge formed by nature, nearly on a level with the commencement of the fall. After mu&s;ing by it a long time, I turned to|wards the other &s;ide, and &s;aw a gentle &s;tream &s;tray calmly out. I &s;hould have concluded that it had no communication with the torrent, had I not &s;een a huge log, that fell headlong down the ca&s;cade, &s;teal peacefully into the purl|ing &s;tream.</P>
<P>I retired from the&s;e wild &s;cenes with regret to a mi&s;erable inn, and next norning returned to Gothenburg, to prepare for my journey to Copenhagen.</P>
<P>I was &s;orry to leave Gothenburg, without travelling further into Sweden; yet I ima|gine, I &s;hould only have &s;een a romantic coun|try thinly inhabited, and the&s;e inhabitants
<PB N="161" REF="031653_0161_0fed8ff44645aac8">
&s;truggling with poverty. The norwegian pea|&s;antry, mo&s;tly independent, have a rough kind of frankne&s;s in their manner; but the &s;wedi&s;h, rendered more abject by mi&s;ery, have a degree of politene&s;s in their addre&s;s, which, though it may &s;ometimes border on in&s;incerity, is often|er the effect of a broken &s;pirit, rather &s;oftened than degraded by wretchedne&s;s.</P>
<P>In Norway there are no notes in circulation of le&s;s value than a &s;wedi&s;h rixdollar. A &s;mall &s;ilver cion, commonly not worth more than a penny, and never more than twopence, &s;erves for change: but in Sweden they have notes as low as &s;ixpence. I never &s;aw any &s;ilver pieces there, and could not without difficulty, and giving a premium, obtain the value of a rixdol|lar, in a large copper coin, to give away on the road to the poor who open the gates</P>
<P>As another proof of the poverty of Sweden, I ought to mention that foreign merchants, who have acquired a fortune there, are oblig|ed to depo&s;it the &s;ixth part when they leave the kingdom. This law, you may &s;uppo&s;e, is frequently evaded.</P>
<P>In fact, the laws here, as well as in Nor|way, are &s;o relaxed, that they rather favour than re&s;train knavery.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t I was at Gothenburg, a man who had been confined for breaking open his ma&s;|ter's de&s;k, and running away with five or &s;ix thou&s;and rixdollars, was only &s;entenced to
<PB N="162" REF="031653_0162_0fed8fa9a04e5ed8">
forty days confinement on bread and water; and this &s;light puni&s;hment his relations render|ed nugatory by &s;upplying him with more &s;a|voury food.</P>
<P>The &s;wedes are in general attached to their families; yet a divorce may be obtained by ei|ther party, on proving the infidelity of the o|ther, or acknowledging it them&s;elves. The women do not often recur to this equal privi|lege; for they either retaliate on their hu&s;|bands, by following their own devices, or &s;ink into the mere&s;t dome&s;tic drudges, worn down by tyranny to &s;ervile &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Do not term me &s;evere, if I add, that after youth is flown, the hu&s;band becomes a &s;ot; and the wife amu|&s;es her&s;elf by &s;colding her &s;ervants. In fact what is to be expected in any country where ta&s;te and cultivation of mind do not &s;upply the place of youthful beauty and animal &s;pirits? Affection requires a firmer foundation than &s;ym|pathy; and few people have a principle of action &s;ufficiently &s;table to produce rectitude of feeling; for, in &s;pite of all the arguments I have heard to ju&s;tify deviations from duty, I am per&s;uaded that even the mo&s;t &s;pontaneous &s;en&s;ations are more under the direction of principle than weak people are willing to al|low.</P>
<P>But adieu to moralizing. I have been writ|ing the&s;e la&s;t &s;heets at aniun in El&s;ineur, where I am waiting for hor&s;es; and as they are not yet ready, I will give you a &s;hort account of my journney from Gothenburg; for I &s;et out
<PB N="163" REF="031653_0163_0fed8ff5e4154248">
the morning after I returned from Trolbaettae.</P>
<P>The country, daring the fir&s;t day's journey, pre&s;ented a mo&s;t barren appearance; as rocky, yet not &s;o picture&s;que as Norway, becau&s;e on a diminutive &s;cale. We &s;topt to &s;leep at a toler|lerable inn in Falckerlberg, a decent little town.</P>
<P>The next day beeches and oaks began to grace the pro&s;pects, the &s;ea every now and then ap|pearing to give them dignity. I could not a|void ob&s;erving al&s;o, that even in this part of Sweden, one of the mo&s;t &s;terile, as I was inform|ed, there was more ground under cultivation than in Norway. Plains of varied crops &s;tretch|ed out to a con&s;iderable extent, and &s;loped down to the &s;hore, no longer terrific. And, as far as I could judge, from glancing my eye over the country, as we drove along, agricul|ture was in a more advanced &s;tate; though, in the habitations, a greater appearance of pover|ty &s;till remained. The cottages indeed often looked mo&s;t uncomfortable, but never &s;o mi&s;er|able as tho&s;e I had remarked on the road to Strom&s;tad; and the towns were equal, if not &s;uperior to many of the little towns in Wales, or &s;ome I have pa&s;&s;ed through in my way from Calais to Paris.</P>
<P>The inns, as we advanced, were not to be complained of, unle&s;s I had always thought of England. The people were civil, and much more moderate in their demands than the nor|wegians, particularly to the we&s;tward, where
<PB N="164" REF="031653_0154_0fed8facabfa3978">
they boldly charge for what you never had, and &s;eem to con&s;ider you, as they do a wreck, if not as lawful prey, yet as a lucky chance, which they ought not to neglect to &s;eize.</P>
<P>The pro&s;pect of El&s;ineur, as we pa&s;&s;ed the Sound, was plea&s;ant. I gave three rixdollars for my boat, including &s;omething to drink. I mention the &s;um, becau&s;e they impo&s;e on &s;tran|gers.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">COPENHAGEN.</HEAD>
<P>THE di&s;tance from El&s;ineur to Copenha|gen is twenty-two miles; the road is ve|ry good, over a flat country diver&s;ified with wood, mo&s;tly beech, and decent man&s;ions. There appeared to be a great quantity of corn land; and the &s;oil looked much more fertile than it is in general &s;o near the &s;ea. The ri&s;|ing grounds indeed were very few; and around Copenhagen it is a perfect plain, of cour&s;e has nothing to recommend it, but cultivation, not decorations. If I &s;ay that the hou&s;es did not di&s;gu&s;t me, I tell you all I remember of them; for I cannot recollect any plea&s;urable &s;en&s;ations they excited: or that any object, produced by nature or art, took me out of my&s;elf. The view of the city, as we drew near, was rather grand, but without any &s;triking feature to in|tere&s;t the imagination, excepting the trees which &s;hade the foot-paths.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t before I reached Copenhagen, I &s;aw a number of tents on a wide plain, and &s;uppo&s;ed that the rage for encampments had reach|ed this city; but I &s;oon di&s;covered that they
<PB N="166" REF="031653_0165_0fed8fb286a71060">
were the a&s;ylum of many of the poor families who had been driven out of their habitations by the late fire.</P>
<P>Entering &s;oon after, I pa&s;&s;ed among&s;t the du&s;t and rubbi&s;h it had left, affrighted by view|ing the extent of the deva&s;tation; for at lea&s;t a quarter of the city had been de&s;troyed. There was little in the appearance of fallen bricks and &s;tacks of chimneys to allure the imagination in|to &s;oothing melancholy reveries; nothing to attract the eye of ta&s;te, but much to afflict the benevolent heart. The depredations of time have always &s;omething in them to employ the fancy, or lead to mu&s;ing on &s;ubjects which, withdrawing the mind from objects of &s;en&s;e, &s;eem to give it new dignity: but here I was treading on live a&s;hes. The &s;ufferers were &s;till under the pre&s;&s;ure of the mi&s;ery occa&s;ioned by this dreadful conflagration. I could not take refuge in the thought; <HI>they &s;uffered&mdash;but they are no more!</HI> a reflection I frequently &s;ummon to calm my mind when &s;ympathy ri&s;es to an|gui&s;h; I therefore de&s;ired the driver to ha&s;ten to the hotel recommended to me, that I might avert in my eyes, and &s;nap the train of think|ing which had &s;ent me into all the corners of the city, in &s;earch of hou&s;ele&s;s heads.</P>
<P>This morning I have been walking round the town, till I am weary of ob&s;erving the ra|vages. I had often heard the danes, even tho&s;e who had &s;een Paris and London, &s;peak of Copenhagen with rapture. Certainly I have &s;een it in a very di&s;advantageous light, &s;ome of
<PB N="167" REF="031653_0166_0fed8ffecf40b960">
the be&s;t &s;treets having been burnt and the whole place thrown into confu&s;ion. Still the utmo&s;t that can, or could ever, I believe, have been &s;aid in its prai&s;e, might be compri&s;ed in a few words. The &s;treets are open, and many of the hou&s;es large; but I &s;aw nothing to rou&s;e the idea of elegance or grandeur, if I except the circus where the king and prince royal re&s;ide.</P>
<P>The palace, which was con&s;umed about two years ago, mu&s;t have been a hand&s;ome &s;pacious building: the &s;tone-work is &s;till &s;tanding; and a great number of the poor, during the late fire, took refuge in its rains, till they could find &s;ome other abode. Beds were thrown on the landing places of the grand &s;tair-ca&s;e, where whole families crept from the cold, and every little nook is boarded up as a retreat for &s;ome poor creatures deprived of their home. At pre&s;ent a roof may be &s;ufficient to &s;helter them from the night air; but as the &s;ea&s;on advances, the extent of the calamity will be more &s;evere|ly felt, I fear, though the exertions on the part of government are very con&s;iderable. Private charity has al&s;o, no doubt, done much to alleviate the mi&s;ery which obtrudes it&s;elf at every turn; &s;till public &s;pirit appears to me to be hardly alive here. Had it exi&s;ted, the con|flag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tion might have been &s;mothered in the be|ginning, as it was at la&s;t, by tearing down &s;e|veral hou&s;es before the flames had reached them. To this the inhabitants would not con&s;ent; and the prince royal not having &s;ufficient ener|gy of character to know when he ought to be
<PB N="168" REF="031653_0167_0fed8fb42552b7d0">
ab&s;olute, calmly let them pur&s;ue their own cour&s;e, till the whole city &s;eemed to be threat|ened with de&s;truction. Adhering, with pue|rile &s;crupulo&s;ity, to the law, which he has im|po&s;ed on him&s;elf, of acting exactly right, he did wrong by idly lamenting, whil&s;t he marked the progre&s;s of a mi&s;chief that one decided &s;tep would have &s;topt. He was afterwards obliged to re&s;ort to violent mea&s;ures; but then&mdash;who could blame him? And, to avoid cen&s;ure, what &s;acrifices are not made by weak minds!</P>
<P>A gentleman, who was a witne&s;s of the &s;cene, a&s;&s;ured me, likewi&s;e, that if the people of property had taken half as much pains to ex|tingui&s;h the fire, as to pre&s;erve their valuables and furniture, it would &s;oon have been got under. But they who were not immediately in danger did not exert them&s;elves &s;ufficiently, till fear, like an electrical &s;hock, rou&s;ed all the inhabitants to a &s;en&s;e of the general evil. Even the fire engines were out of order, though the burning of the palace ought to have admoni&s;h|ed them of the nece&s;&s;ity of keeping them in con&s;tant repair. But this kind of indolence, re&s;pecting what does not immediately concern them, &s;eems to characterize the danes. A &s;luggi&s;h concentration in them&s;elves makes them &s;o careful to pre&s;erve their property, that they will not venture on any enterpri&s;e to increa&s;e it, in which there is a &s;hadow of ha|zard.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering Copenhagen as the capital of Denmark and Norway, I was &s;urpri&s;ed not to
<PB N="169" REF="031653_0168_0fed90006d518c18">
&s;ee &s;o much indu&s;try or ta&s;te as in Chri&s;tiania. Indeed from every thing I have had an oppor|tunity of ob&s;erving, the danes are the people who have made the fewe&s;t &s;acrifices to the graces.</P>
<P>The men of bu&s;ine&s;s are dome&s;tic tyrants, coldly immer&s;ed in their own affairs, and &s;o ig|norant of the &s;tate of other countries, that they dogmatically a&s;&s;ert that Denmark is the happie&s;t country in the world; the prince royal the be&s;t of all po&s;&s;ible princes; and count Bern&s;torff the wi&s;e&s;t of mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>As for the women, they are &s;imply notable hou&s;ewives; without accompli&s;hments, or any of the charms that adorn more advanced &s;ocial life. This total ignorance may enable them to &s;ave &s;omething in their kitchens; but it is far from rendering them better parents. On the contrary, the children are &s;poilt; as they u&s;u|ally are, when left to the care of weak, indul|gent mothers, who having no principle of acti|on to regulate their feelings, become the &s;laves of infants, enfeebling both body and mind by fal&s;e tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>I am perhaps a little prejudiced, as I write from the impre&s;&s;ion of the moment; for I have been tormented to-day by the pre&s;ence of un|ruly children, and made angry by &s;ome invec|tives throw out again&s;t the maternal character of the unfortunate Matilda. She was cen&s;ured, with the mo&s;t cruel in&s;inuation, for her ma|nagement of her &s;on; though, from what I
<PB N="170" REF="031653_0169_0fed8fb5c790ef78">
could gather, &s;he gave proofs of good &s;en&s;e, as well as tenderne&s;s in her attention to him. She u&s;ed to bathe him her&s;elf every morning; in|&s;i&s;ted on his being loo&s;ely clad; and would not permit his attendants to injure his dige&s;tion, by humouring his appetite. She was equally care|ful to prevent his acquiring haughty airs, and playing the tyrant in leading-&s;trings. The queen dowager would not permit her to &s;uc|kle him; but the next child being a daughter, and not the heir apparent of the crown, le&s;s oppo&s;ition was made to her di&s;charging the du|ty of a mother.</P>
<P>Poor Matilda! thou ha&s;t haunted me ever &s;ince my arrival; and the view I have had of the manners of the country, exciting my &s;ym|pathy, has increa&s;ed my re&s;pect for thy me|mory!</P>
<P>I am now fully convinced that &s;he was the victim of the party &s;he di&s;placed, who would have overlooked, or encouraged, her attach|ment, had her lover not, aiming at being u&s;e|ful, attempted to overturn &s;ome e&s;tabli&s;hed abu&s;es before the people, ripe for the change, had &s;ufficient &s;pirit to &s;upport him when &s;trug|gling in their behalf. Such indeed was the a&s;|perity &s;harpened again&s;t her, that I have heard her, even after &s;o many years have elap&s;ed, charg|ed with licentiou&s;ne&s;s, not only for endeavouring to render the public amu&s;ements more elegant, but for her very charities, becau&s;e &s;he erected among&s;t other in&s;titutions, an ho&s;pital to re|ceive foundlings. Di&s;gu&s;ted with many cu&s;|toms
<PB N="171" REF="031653_0170_0fed9002103834d8">
which pa&s;s for virtues, though they are nothing more than ob&s;ervances of forms, often at the expence of truth, &s;he probably ran into an error common to innovators, in wi&s;hing to do immediately what can only be done by time.</P>
<P>Many very cogent rea&s;ons have been urged by her friends to prove, that her affection for Struen&s;ee was never carried to the length al|ledged again&s;t her, by tho&s;e who feared her in|fluence. Be that as it may, &s;he certainly was not a woman of gallantry; and if &s;he had an attachment for him, it did not di&s;grace her heart or under&s;tanding the king being a no|torious debauchee, and an idiot into the bar|gain. As the king's conduct had always been directed by &s;ome favourite, they al&s;o endea|voured to govern him, from a principle of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, as well as a laudable ambition; but, not aware of the prejudicies they had to encounter, the &s;y&s;tem they adopted di&s;played more benevolence of heart than &s;oundne&s;s of judgement. As to the charge, &s;till believed, of their living the king drugs to injure his fa|culties, it is too ab&s;urd to be refuted. Their oppre&s;&s;ors had better have accu&s;ed them of dab|bling in the black art; for the potent &s;pell &s;till keeps his wits in bondage.</P>
<P>I cannot de&s;cribe to you the effect it had on me to &s;ee this puppet of a monarch moved by the &s;trings which count Bern&s;torff holds fa&s;t; &s;it, with vacant eye, erect, receiving the ho|mage of courtiers, who mock him with a &s;hew
<PB N="172" REF="031653_0171_0fed8fb766d12240">
of re&s;pect. He is, in fact, merely a machine of &s;tate, to &s;ub&s;cribe the name of a king to the acts of the government, which, to avoid danger, have no value, unle&s;s counter&s;igned by the prince royal, for he is allowed to be ab&s;olute|ly an idiot, excepting that now and then an ob&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rvation, or trick, e&s;capes him, which looks more like madne&s;s than imbecility.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIX.</HEAD>
<P>BUSINESS having obliged me to go a few miles out of town this morning, I was &s;urpri&s;ed at meeting a crowd of people of every de&s;cription; and enquiring the cau&s;e, of a &s;er|vant who &s;poke french, I was informed that a man had been executed two hours before, and the body afterwards burnt. I could not help looking with horror around&mdash;the fields lo&s;t their verdure&mdash;and I turned with di&s;gu&s;t from the well-dre&s;&s;ed women, who were re|turning with their children from this &s;ight. What a &s;pectacle for humanity! The &s;eeing &s;uch a flock of idle gazers, plunged me into a train of reflections, on the pernicious effects produced by fal&s;e notions of ju&s;tice. And I am per&s;uaded that till capital puni&s;hments be entirely aboli&s;hed, executions ought to have every appearance of horrour given to them; in&s;tead of being, as they are now, a &s;cene of amu&s;ement for the gaping crowd, where &s;ympathy is quickly effaced by curio&s;i|ty.</P>
<P>I have always been of opinion that the allow|ing actors to die, in the pre&s;ence of the audi|ence, has an immoral tendency; but trifling when compared with the ferocity acquire
<PB N="174" REF="031653_0173_0fed8fbee61ff6c8">
viewing the reality as a &s;how; for it &s;eems to me, that in all countries the common people go to executions to &s;ee how the poor wretch plays his part, rather than to commi&s;erate his fate, much le&s;s to think of the breach of morality which has brought him to &s;uch a deplorable end. Con&s;equently executions, far from being u&s;e|ful examples to the &s;urvivors, have, I am per|&s;uaded, a quite contrary effect, by hardening the heart they ought to terrify. Be&s;ides, the fear of an ignominious death, I believe, never deterred any one from the commi&s;&s;ion of a crime, becau&s;e in committing it, the mind is rou&s;ed to activity about pre&s;ent circum&s;tances. It is a game at hazard, at which all expect the turn of the die in their own favour; never re|flecting on the chance of ruin, till it comes. In fact, from what I &s;aw, in the fortre&s;&s;es of Nor|way, I am more and more convinced that the &s;ame energy of character, which renders a man a daring villain, would have rendered him u&s;e|ful to &s;ociety, had that &s;ociety been well orga|nized. When a &s;trong mind is not di&s;ciplined by cultivation, it is a &s;en&s;e of inju&s;tice that ren|ders it unju&s;t.</P>
<P>Executions, however, occur very rarely at Copenhagen; for timidity, rather than cle|mency, pal&s;ies all the operations of the pre|&s;ent government. The malefactor, who died this morning, would not, probably, have been puni&s;hed with death at any other period; but an incendiary excites univer&s;al execration; and as the greater part of the inhabitants are &s;till di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the late conflagration, an ex|ample
<PB N="175" REF="031653_0174_0fed900b0612fa38">
was thought ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; though, from what I can gather, the fire was accidental.</P>
<P>Not, but that I have very &s;eriou&s;ly been informed, that combu&s;tible materials were placed at proper di&s;tances, by the emi&s;&s;aries of Mr. Pitt; and, to corroborate the fact, ma|ny people in&s;i&s;t, that the flames bur&s;t out at once in different parts of the city; not allow|ing the wind to have any hand in it. So much for the plot. But the fabricators of plots in all countries build their conjectures on the "ba&s;e|le&s;s fabric of a vi&s;ion;" and, it &s;eems even a &s;ort of poetical ju&s;tice, that whil&s;t this mini&s;ter is cru&s;hing at home, plots of his own conjuring up, that on the continent, and in the north he &s;hould, with as little foundation, be accu&s;ed of wi&s;hing to &s;et the world on fire.</P>
<P>I forgot to mention, to you, that I was in|formed, by a man of veracity, that two per|&s;ons came to the &s;take to drink a gla&s;s of the criminal's blood, as an infallible remedy for the apoplexy. And when I animadverted in the company, where it was mentioned, on &s;uch a horrible violation of nature, a dani&s;h lady re|proved me very &s;everely, a&s;king how I knew that it was not a cure for the di&s;ea&s;e? adding, that every attempt was ju&s;tifiable in &s;earch of health. I did not, you may imagine, enter in|to an argument with a per&s;on the &s;lave of &s;uch a gro&s;s prejudice. And I allude to it not only as a trait of the ignorance of the people, but to cen&s;ure the government, for not preventing

<P>Since the fire, the inhabitants have been very a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly employed in &s;earching for pro|perty &s;ecreted during the confu&s;ion; and it is a&s;toni&s;hing how many people, formerly term|ed reptuable, had availed them&s;elves of the common calamity to purloin what the flames &s;pared.

war. In &s;hort, under whatever point of view I con&s;ider &s;ociety, it appears, to me, that an adoration of property is the root of all evil. Here it does not render the people enterpri&s;ing, as in America, but thrifty and cautions. I ne|ver, therefore was in a capital where there was &s;o little appearance of active indu&s;try; and as for gaiety, I looked in vain for the &s;prightly gait of the norwegians, who in every re&s;pect appear to me to have got the &s;tart of them. This difference I attribute to their hav|ing more liberty; a liberty which they think their right by inheritance, whil&s;t the danes, when they boa&s;t of their negative happine&s;s, al|ways mention it as the boon of the prince roy|al, under the &s;uperintending wi&s;dom of count Bern&s;torff. Va&s;&s;allage is neverthele&s;s cea&s;ing throughout the kingdom, and with it will pa&s;s away that &s;ordid avarice which every modifica|tion of &s;lavery is calculated to produce.</P>
<P>If the chief u&s;e of property be power, in the &s;hape of the re&s;pect it procures, is it not among the incon&s;i&s;tencies of human nature mo&s;t in|comprehen&s;ible, that men &s;hould find a plea|&s;ure in hoarding up property which they &s;teal from their nece&s;&s;ities, even when they are con|vinced that it would be dangerous to di&s;play &s;uch an enviable &s;uperiority?

<P>I have before mentioned that the men are dome&s;tic tyrants, con&s;idering them as fathers, brothers, or hu&s;bands; but there is a kind of interregnum between the reign of the father and hu&s;band, which is the only period of free|dom and plea&s;ure that the women enjoy. Young people, who are attached to each other, with the con&s;ent of their friends, exchange rings, and are permitted to enjoy a degree of liberty together, which I have never noticed in any other country. The days of court&s;hip are therefore prolonged, till it be perfectly con|venient to marry: the intimacy often be|comes very tender: and if the lover obtain the privilege of a hu&s;band, it can only be termed half by &s;tealth, becau&s;e the family is wilfully blind. It happens very rarely that the&s;e ho|norary engagements are di&s;&s;olved or di&s;regard|ed, a &s;tigma being attached to a breach of faith, which is thought more di&s;graceful, if not &s;o

<P>The intere&s;ting picture frequently drawn of the virtues of a ri&s;ing people has, I fear, been fallacious, excepting the accounts of the enthu|&s;ia&s;m which various public &s;truggles have pro|duced.

I am obliged &s;ometimes to recollect the numberle&s;s in&s;tances which I have either wit|ne&s;&s;ed, or heard well authenticated, to balance the account of horrours, alas! but too true.

<P>I HAVE formerly cen&s;ured the french for their extreme attachment to theatrical exhi|bitions, becau&s;e I thought that they tended to render them vain and unnatural characters. But I mu&s;t acknowledge, e&s;pecially as women of the town never appear in the pari&s;ian, as at our theatres, that the little &s;aving of the week is more u&s;efully expended there, every &s;unday, than in porter or brandy, to intoxicate or &s;tu|pify the mind. The common people of France have a great &s;uperiority over that cla&s;s in every other country on this very &s;core. It is merely the &s;obriety of the pari&s;ians which renders their fetes more intere&s;ting, their gaiety never becoming di&s;gu&s;ting or dangerous; as is always the ca&s;e when liquor circulates. Intoxication is the plea&s;ure of &s;avages, and of all tho&s;e who&s;e employments rather exhau&s;t their animal &s;pirits, than exerci&s;e their faculties. Is not this, in fact, the vice, both in England and the nor|thern &s;tates of Europe, which appears to be the greate&s;t impediment to general improvement? Drinking is here the principal relaxation of the men, including &s;moking; but the women are very ab&s;temious, though they have no public amu&s;ements as a &s;ub&s;titute. I ought to except one theatre, which appears more than
<PB N="184" REF="031653_0183_0fed8fce0d07f7d0">
is nece&s;&s;ary; for when I was there, it was not half full; and neither the ladies nor actre&s;&s;es di&s;played much fancy in their dre&s;s.</P>
<P>The play was founded on the &s;tory of the Mock Doctor; and, from the ge&s;tures of the &s;ervants, who were the be&s;t actors, I &s;hould imagine contained &s;ome humour. The farce, termed ballat, was a kind of pantomime, the childi&s;h incidents of which were &s;ufficient to &s;hew the &s;tate of the dramatic art in Denmark, and the gro&s;s ta&s;te of the audience. A magici|an, in the di&s;gui&s;e of a tinker, enters a cottage where the women are all bu&s;y ironing, and rubs a dirty frying-pan again&s;t the linen. The women rai&s;e an hue-and-cry, and dance after him, rou&s;ing their hu&s;bands, who join in the dan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, but get the &s;tart of them in the pur|&s;uit. The tinker, with the frying-pan for a &s;hield, renders them immoveble, and blacks their cheeks. Each laughs at the other, un|con&s;cious of his own apearance; mean while the women enter to enjoy the &s;port, <HI>'the rare fun,'</HI> with other incidents of the &s;ame &s;pe|cies.</P>
<P>The &s;inging was much on a par with the danc|ing; the one as de&s;titute of grace, as the other of expre&s;&s;ion; but the orche&s;tra was well filled, the in&s;trumental being far &s;uperior to the vocal mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>I have likewi&s;e vi&s;ited the public library and mu&s;eum, as well as the palace of Ro&s;embourg. This palace, now de&s;erted, di&s;plays a gloomy
<PB N="185" REF="031653_0184_0fed901a40447758">
kind of grandeur throughout; for the &s;ilence of &s;pacious apartments always makes it&s;elf to be felt; I at lea&s;t feel it; and I li&s;ten for the &s;ound of my foot&s;teps, as I have done at midnight to the ticking of the death-watch&punc; encouraging a kind of fanciful &s;uper&s;tition. Every object carried me back to pa&s;t times, and impre&s;&s;ed the manners of the age forcibly on my mind. In this point of view the pre&s;ervation of old palaces, and their tarni&s;hed furniture, is u&s;eful; for they may be con&s;idered as hi&s;torical docu|ments.</P>
<P>The vacuum left by departed greatne&s;s was every where ob&s;ervable, whil&s;t the battles and proce&s;&s;ions, pourtrayed on the walls, told you who had here excited revelry after retiring from &s;laughter; or di&s;mi&s;&s;ed pageantry in &s;earch of plea&s;ure. It &s;eeemed a va&s;t tomb, full of the &s;hadowy phantoms of tho&s;e who had played or toiled their hour out, and &s;unk behind the ta|pe&s;try, which celebrated the conque&s;ts of love or war. Could they be no more&mdash;to whom my imagination thus gave life; Could the thoughts, of which there remained &s;o many ve&s;tiges, have vani&s;hed quite away? And the&s;e beings, compo&s;ed of &s;uch noble materials of thinking and feeling, have they only melt|ed into the elements to keep in motion the grand ma&s;s of life? It cannot be!&mdash;As ea&s;ily could I believe that the large &s;ilver lions, at the top of the banqueting room, thought and rea|&s;oned. But avaunt! ye waking dreams!&mdash; yet I cannot de&s;cribe the curio&s;ities to you.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="031653_0185_0fed8fcfac12a760">There were cabinets full of baubles, and gems, and &s;words, which mu&s;t have been wielded by giant's hand. The coronation ornaments wait quietly here till warned; and the wardrobe exhibits the ve&s;tments which formerly graced the&s;e &s;hews. It is a pity they do not lend them to the actors, in&s;tead of allowing them to peri&s;h ingloriou&s;ly.</P>
<P>I have not vi&s;ited any other palace, except|ing Hir&s;holm; the gardens of which are laid out with ta&s;te, and command the fine&s;t views the country affords. As they are in the mo|dern and engli&s;h &s;tyle, I thought I was follow|ing the foot&s;teps of Matilda, who wi&s;hed to mul|tiply around her the images of her beloved country. I was al&s;o gratified by the &s;ight of a norwegian land&s;cape in miniature, which with great propriety makes a part of the dani&s;h king's garden. The cottage is well imitated, and the whole has a plea&s;ing effect, particularly &s;o to me who love Norway&mdash;it's peaceful farms and &s;pacious wilds.</P>
<P>The public library con&s;i&s;ts of a collection much larger than I expected to &s;ee; and it is well arranged. Of the value of the Icelandic manu&s;cripts I could not form a judgment, though the alphabet of &s;ome of them amu&s;ed me, by &s;hewing what immen&s;e labour men will &s;ubmit to, in order to tran&s;mit their ideas to po&s;terity. I have &s;ometimes thought it a great misfortune for individuals to acquire a certain delicacy of &s;entiment, which often makes them weary of the common occurrences of life;
<PB N="187" REF="031653_0186_0fed901bdeda7fa0">
yet it is this very delicacy of feeling and think|ing which probably has produced mo&s;t of the performances that have benefited mankind. It might with propriety, perhaps, he termed the malady of genius: the cau&s;e of that character|i&s;tic melancholy which 'grows with its growth, and &s;trengthens with its &s;trength.'</P>
<P>There are &s;ome good pictures in the royal mu&s;eum&mdash;Do not &s;tart&mdash;I am not going to trouble you with a dull catalogue, or &s;tupid critici&s;ms on ma&s;ters, to whom time has a&s;&s;ign|ed their ju&s;t niche in the temple of fame; had there been any by living arti&s;ts of this country, I &s;hould nave noticed them, as making a part of the &s;ketches I am drawing of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the place. The good pictures were mixed indi&s;criminately with the bad ones, in order to a&s;&s;ort the frames. The &s;ame fault is con&s;picu|ous in the new &s;plendid gallery forming at Pa|ris; though it &s;eems an obvious thought that a &s;chool for arti&s;ts ought to be arranged in &s;uch a manner, as to &s;hew the progre&s;&s;ive di&s;coveries and improvements in the art.</P>
<P>A collection of the dre&s;&s;es, arms, and imple|ments of the Laplanders attracted my attention, di&s;playing that fir&s;t &s;pecies of ingenuity which is rather a proof of patient per&s;everance, than comprehen&s;ion of mind. The &s;pecimens of na|tural hi&s;tory, and curio&s;ities of art, were likewi&s;e huddled together without that &s;cientific order which alone renders them u&s;eful; but this may partly have been occa&s;ioned by the ha&s;ty manner in which they were removed from the palace, when in flames.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="031653_0187_0fed8fd15016a318">There are &s;ome re&s;pectable men of &s;cience here, but few literary characters, and fewer arti&s;ts. They want encouragement, and will continue, I fear, from the pre&s;ent appearance of things, to langui&s;h unnoticed a long time; for neither the vanity of wealth, nor the en|terpri&s;ing &s;pirit of commerce, has yet thrown a glance that way.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the prince royal, determined to be oeconomical, almo&s;t de&s;cends to par&s;imony; and perhaps depre&s;&s;es his &s;ubjects, by labouring not to oppre&s;s them; for his intentions always &s;eem to be good&mdash;yet nothing can give a more forcible idea of the dullne&s;s which eats away all activity of mind, than the in&s;ipid routine of a court, without magnificence or elegance.</P>
<P>The prince, from what I can now collect, has very moderate abilities; yet is &s;o well di&s;|po&s;ed, that count Bern&s;torff finds him as tracta|ble as he could wi&s;h; for I con&s;ider the count as the real &s;overeign, &s;carcely behind the cur|tain; the prince having none of that ob&s;tinate &s;elf-&s;ufficiency of youth, &s;o often the fore-run|ner of deci&s;ion of character. He, and the prin|ce&s;s his wife, dine every day with the king, to &s;ave the expence of two tables. What a mum|mery it mu&s;t be to treat as a king a being who has lo&s;t the maje&s;ty of man! But even count Bern&s;torff's morality &s;ubmits to this &s;tanding impo&s;ition; and he avails him&s;elf of it &s;ome|times, to &s;often a refu&s;al of his own, by &s;aying it is the <HI>will</HI> of the king, my ma&s;ter, when every body knows that he has neither
<PB N="189" REF="031653_0188_0fed901d81addee0">
will nor memory. Much the &s;ame u&s;e is made of him as, I have ob&s;erved, &s;ome termagant wives make of their hu&s;bands; they would dwell on the nece&s;&s;ity of obeying their hu&s;|bands, poor pa&s;&s;ive &s;ouls, who never were al|lowed <HI>to will,</HI> when they wanted to conceal their own tyranny.</P>
<P>A &s;tory is told here of the king's formerly making a dog coun&s;ellor of &s;tate, becau&s;e when the dog, accu&s;tomed to eat at the royal table, &s;natched a piece of meat off an old officer's plate, he reproved him joco&s;ely, &s;aying that he, <HI>mon&s;ieur le chien,</HI> had not the previlege of dining with his maje&s;ty; a privilege annexed to this di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>The burning of the palace was, in fact, a fortunate circum&s;tance, as it afforded a pretext for reducing the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the hou&s;hold, which was far too great for the revenue of the crown. The prince Royal, at pre&s;ent, runs into the oppo&s;ite extreme; and the formality, if not the par&s;imony, of the court, &s;eems to extend to all the other branches of &s;ociety, which I had an opportunity of ob&s;erving; though ho&s;pitality &s;till characterizes their inter|cour&s;e with &s;trangers.</P>
<P>But let me now &s;top; I may be a little partial and view every thing with the jaun|diced eye of melancholy&mdash;for I am &s;ad&mdash;and have cau&s;e.</P>

<P>I HAVE &s;een count Bern&s;torff; and his conver&s;ation confirms me in the opinion I had previou&s;ly formed of him;&mdash;I mean, &s;ince my arrival at Copenhagen, He is a worthy man, a little vain of his virtue <HI>a la Necker</HI>; and more anxious not to do wrong, that is to avoid blame, than de&s;irous of doing good; e&s;pe|cially if any particular good demands a change. Prudence, in &s;hort, &s;eems to be the ba&s;is of his character; and, from the tenour of the govern|ment, I &s;hould think inclining to that cautious circum&s;pection which treads on the heels of ti|midity. He has con&s;iderable information, and &s;ome fine&s;&s;e; or he could not be a mini&s;ter. Determined not to ri&s;k his popularity, for he is tenderly careful of his reputation, he will never gloriou&s;ly fail like Struen&s;ee, or di&s;turb, with the energy of genius, the &s;tagnant &s;tate of the public mind.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e that Lavater, whom he invited to vi&s;it him two years ago, &s;ome &s;ay to fix the principles of the chri&s;tian religion firmly in the prince royal's mind, found lines in his face to prove him a &s;tate&s;man of the fir&s;t order; be|cau&s;e he has a knack at &s;eeing a great character in the countenances of men in exalted &s;tations,
<PB N="191" REF="031653_0190_0fed9021f7b02638">
who have noticed him, or his works. Be&s;ides, the count's &s;entiments relative to the french revolution, agreeing with Lavater's, mu&s;t have en&s;ured his applau&s;e.</P>
<P>The danes, in general, &s;eem extremely aver&s;e to innovation, and, if happine&s;s only con&s;i&s;ts in opinion, they are the happie&s;t people in the world; for I never &s;aw any &s;o well &s;atisfied with their own &s;ituation. Yet the climate appears to be very di&s;agreeable; the weather being dry and &s;ultry, or moi&s;t and cold; the atmo&s;phere never having that &s;harp, bracing purity, which in Norway pre|pares you to brave its rigours. I do not then hear the inhabitants of this place talk with delight of the winter, which is the con&s;tant theme of the norwegians, on the contrary they &s;eem to dread its comfortle&s;s inclemency.</P>
<P>The ramparts are plea&s;ant, and mu&s;t have been much more &s;o before the fire, the walkers not being annoyed by the clouds of du&s;t, which, at pre&s;ent, the &s;lighte&s;t wind wafts from the ruins. The wind-mills, and the comfortable hou&s;es contiguous, belonging to the millers, as well as the appearance of the &s;pacious barracks for the &s;oldiers and &s;ailors, tend to render this walk more agreeable.</P>
<P>The view of the country has not much to recommend it to notice, but its extent and cul|tivation: yet as the eye always delights to dwell on verdant plains, e&s;pecially when we are re&s;ident in a great city, the&s;e &s;hady walks

&s;hould be reckoned among&s;t the advantages pro|cured by the government for the inhabitants. I like them better than the royal gardens, al&s;o open to the public, becau&s;e the latter &s;eem &s;unk in the heart of the city, to concentrate its fogs.</P>
<P>The canals, which inter&s;ect the &s;treets, are equally convenient and whole&s;ome; but the view of the &s;ea, commanded by the town, had little to intere&s;t me whil&s;t the remembrance of the various bold and picture&s;que &s;hores, I had &s;een, was fre&s;h in my memory.

<P>One of the be&s;t &s;treets in Copenhagen is al|mo&s;t filled with ho&s;pitals, erected by the go|vernment; and, I am a&s;&s;ured, as well re|gulated as in&s;titutions of this kind are in any country; but whether ho&s;pitals, or work-hou&s;es, are any where &s;uperintended with &s;uf|ficient humanity, I have frequently had rea&s;on to doubt.</P>
<P>The autumn is &s;o uncommonly fine, that I am unwilling to put off my journey to Hamburg much longer, le&s;t the weather &s;hould alter &s;ud|denly, and the chilly harbingers of winter catch me here, where I have nothing now to detain me but the ho&s;pitality of the families to whom I had recommendatory letters.

where the troops exerci&s;e, and the market is kept.

<P>I have remained more at home, &s;ince I ar|rived at Copenhagen, than I ought to have done in a &s;trange place; but the mind is not always equally active in &s;earch of information; and my oppre&s;&s;ed heart too often &s;ighs out.</P>

<P>I ARRIVED at Cor&s;oer the night after I quitted Copenhagen, purpo&s;ing to take my pa&s;&s;age acro&s;s the Great Belt the next morning, though the weather was rather boi&s;terous. It is about four and twenty miles; but as neither I nor my little girl are ever attacked by &s;ea &s;ickne&s;s, though who can avoid <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nnui?</HI> I en|ter a boat with the &s;ame indifference as I change hor&s;es; and as for danger, come when it may, I dread it not &s;ufficiently to have any antici|pating fears.</P>
<P>The road from Copenhagen was very good, through an open, flat country, that had little to recommend it to notice excepting the culti|vation, which gratified my heart more than my eye.</P>
<P>I took a barge with a german baron, who was ha&s;tening back from a tour into Denmark, alarmed by the intelligence of the french hav|ing pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine. His conver&s;ation beguil|ed the time, and gave a &s;ort of &s;timulus to my &s;pirits, which had been growing more and more languid ever &s;ince my return to Gothen|burg&mdash;you know why. I had often endea|voured to rou&s;e my&s;elf to ob&s;ervation by re|flecting
<PB N="195" REF="031653_0194_0fed9026a68e0690">
that I was pa&s;&s;ing through &s;eemed which I &s;hould probably never &s;ee again, and con&s;e|quently ought not to omit ob&s;erving; &s;till I fell into reveries, thinking, by way of excu&s;e, that enlargement of mind and refined feelings are of little u&s;e, but to barb the arrows of &s;or|row which waylay us every where, ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ding the &s;agacity of wi&s;dom, and rendering princi|ples unavailing, if con&s;idered as a brea&s;t-work to &s;ecure our own hearts.</P>
<P>Though we had not a direct wind, we were not detained more than three hours and a half on the water, ju&s;t long enough to give us an appetite for our dinner.</P>
<P>We travelled the remainder of the day, and the following night, in company with the &s;ame party, the german gentlemen whom I have mentioned, his friend, and &s;ervant: the meet|ings, at the po&s;t-hou&s;es, were plea&s;ant to me, who u&s;ually heard nothing but &s;trange tongues around me. Marguerite and the child often fell a&s;leep; and when they were awake, I might &s;till reckon my&s;elf alone, as our train of thoughts had nothing in common. Marguer|ite, it is true, was much amu&s;ed by the <HI>co&s;tume</HI> of the women; particularly by the <HI>partier</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This word in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">nch means <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ith ba&s;ket and hoop.</NOTE> which adorned both their heads and tails; and, with great glee, recounted to me the &s;tories &s;he had trea&s;ured up for her family, when once more within the barriers of dear Paris; not for|getting,

with that arch, agreeable vanity peculiar to the french, which they exhibit whil&s;t half ridiculing it, to remind me of the importance &s;he &s;hould a&s;&s;ume when &s;he inform|ed her friends of all her journeys by &s;ea and land&mdash;&s;hewing the pieces of money &s;he had col|lected, and &s;tammering out a few foreign phra&s;es, which &s;he repeated in a true pari&s;ian ac|cent. Happy thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s; aye, and enviable harmle&s;s vanity, which thus pro|duced a <HI>gait&eacute; du coeur</HI> worth all my philo&s;o|phy.</P>
<P>The man I had hired at Copenhagen advi&s;ed me to go round, about twenty miles, to avoid pa&s;&s;ing the Little Belt, excepting by a ferry, as the wind was contrary. But the gentlemen over-ruled his arguments, which we were all very &s;orry for afterwards, when we found our|&s;elves becalmed on the Little Belt ten hours, tacking about, without cea&s;ing, to gain on the &s;hore.</P>
<P>An over-&s;ight likewi&s;e made the pa&s;&s;age ap|pear much more tedious, nay almo&s;t in&s;upport|able. When I went on board at the Great Belt, I had provided refre&s;hments in ca&s;e of detention, which remaining untouched, I thought not then any &s;uch precaution nece&s;|&s;ary for the &s;econd pa&s;&s;age, mi&s;&s;ed by the epithet of little, though I have &s;ince been in|formed that it is frequently the longe&s;t.</P>
<P>This mi&s;take occa&s;ioned much vexation; for the child, at la&s;t, began to cry &s;o bitterly for

bread, that fancy conjured up before me the wretched Ugolino, with his fami&s;hed children; and I, literally &s;peaking, enveloped my&s;elf in &s;ympathetic horrours, augmented by every tear my babe &s;hed; from which I could not e&s;cape, till we landed, and a luncheon of bread, and ba&s;on of milk; routed the &s;pectres of fancy.</P>
<P>I then &s;upped with my companions, with whom I was &s;oon after to part for ever&mdash;al|ways a mo&s;t melancholy, death-like idea&mdash;a &s;ort of &s;eparation of &s;oul; for all the regret which follows tho&s;e from whom fate &s;eparates us, &s;eems to be &s;omething torn from our&s;elves. The&s;e were &s;trangers I remember; yet when there is any originality in a countenance, it takes its place in our memory; and we are &s;or|ry to lo&s;e an acquaintance the moment he be|gins to intere&s;t us, though picked up on the highway. There was, in fact, a degree of intelligence, and &s;till more &s;en&s;ibility in the features and conver&s;ation of one of the gentlemen, that made me regret the lo&s;s of his &s;ociety during the re&s;t of the journey; for he was compelled to travel po&s;t, by his de|&s;ire to reach his e&s;tate before the arrival of the french.</P>
<P>This was a comfortable inn, as were &s;everal others I &s;topt at; but the heavy &s;andy roads were very fatiguing, after the fine ones we had lately &s;kimmed over both in Sweden and Den|mark. The country re&s;embled the mo&s;t open part of England; laid out for corn, rather
<PB N="198" REF="031653_0197_0fed8fe36bdc1e70">
than grazing: it was plea&s;ant; yet there was little in the pro&s;pects to awaken curio&s;ity, by di&s;playing the peculiar characteri&s;tics of a new country, which had &s;o frequently &s;tole me from my&s;elf in Norway. We often pa&s;&s;ed over large uninclo&s;ed tracts, not graced with trees, or at lea&s;t very &s;paringly enlivened by them; and the half-formed roads &s;eemed to demand the landmarks, &s;et up in the wa&s;te, to prevent the traveller from &s;traying far out of his way, and plodding through the weari&s;ome &s;and.</P>
<P>The heaths were dreary, and had none of the wild charms of tho&s;e of Sweden and Nor|way to cheat time; neither the terrific rocks, nor &s;miling herbage, grateful to the &s;ight, and &s;cented from afar, made us forget their length; &s;till the country appeared much more popu|lous; and the towns, if not the farm-hou&s;es, were &s;uperior to tho&s;e of Norway. I even thought that the inhabitants of the former had more intelligence, at lea&s;t I am &s;ure they had more vivacity in their countenances than I had &s;een during my northern tour: their &s;en&s;es &s;eemed awake to bu&s;ine&s;s and plea&s;ure. I was therefore, gratified by hearing once more the bu&s;y h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n of indu&s;trious men in the day, and the exhilarating &s;ounds of joy in the evening; for as the weather was &s;till fine, the women and children were amu&s;ing them&s;elves at their doors, or walking under the trees, which in many places were planted in the &s;treets; and as mo&s;t of the towns of any note were &s;ituated on little bays, or branches, of the Baltic, their
<PB N="199" REF="031653_0198_0fed902e23b97260">
appearance, as we approached, was often very picture&s;que, and, when we entered, di&s;played the comfort and cleanline&s;s of ea&s;y, if not the eligance of opulent, circum&s;tances. But the cheerfulne&s;s of the people in the &s;treets was par|ticularly grateful to me, after having been de|pre&s;&s;ed by the death-like &s;ilence of tho&s;e of Den|mark, where every hou&s;e made me think of a tomb. The dre&s;s of the pea&s;antry is &s;uited to the climate; in &s;hort, none of that poverty and dirt appeared, at the &s;ight of which the heart &s;ickens.</P>
<P>As I only &s;topt to change hor&s;es, take re|fre&s;hment, and &s;leep, I had not an opportunity of knowing more of the country than conclu&s;i|ons, which the information gathered by my eyes enabled me to draw; and that was &s;uffici|ent to convince me that I &s;hould much rather have lived in &s;ome of the towns I now pa&s;s through, than in any I had &s;een in Sweden or Denmark. The people &s;truck me, as having arrived at that period when the faculties will unfold them&s;elves; in &s;hort, they look alive to improvement, neither congealed by indolence, nor bent down by wretchedne&s;s to &s;ervility.</P>
<P>From the previous impre&s;&s;ion, I &s;carcely can trace from whence I received it, I was agreea|bly &s;urpri&s;ed to perceive &s;uc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters"> appearance of comfort in this part of Germany. I had form|ed a conception of the tyranny of the petty poten|tates that had thrown a gloomy veil over the face of the whole country, in my imagination, that cleared away like the darkne&s;s of night
<PB N="200" REF="031653_0199_0fed908b95a7de78">
before the &s;un. As I &s;aw the reality, I &s;hould, probably have di&s;covered much lurking mi&s;ery the con&s;equence of ignorant oppre&s;&s;ion, no doubt, had I had time to inquire into particu|lars; but it did not &s;talk abroad, and infect the &s;urface over which my eye glanced. Yes, I am per&s;uaded that a con&s;iderable degree of ge|neral knowledge pervades this country; for it is only from the exerci&s;e of the mind that the body acquires the activity from which I drew the&s;e inferences. Indeed the king of Denmark's german dominions, Hol&s;tein, appeared to me far &s;uperiour to any other part of his kingdom which had fallen under my view; and the ro|bu&s;t ru&s;tics to have their mu&s;cles braced, in|&s;tead of the <HI>as it were</HI> lounge of the dani&s;h pea&s;antry.</P>
<P>Arriving at Sle&s;wick, the re&s;idence of prince Charles of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el, the &s;ight of the &s;oldiers recalled all the unplea&s;ing ideas of german de&s;|poti&s;m, which imperceptibly vani&s;hed as I ad|vanced into the country. I viewed, with a mixture of pity and horror, the&s;e beings train|ing to be &s;old to &s;laughter, or be &s;laughtered, and fell into reflections, on an old opinion of mine, that it is the pre&s;ervation of the &s;pecies, not of individuals, which appears to be the de|&s;ign of the Deity throughout the whole of na|ture. Blo&s;&s;oms come forth only to be blighted; fi&s;h lay their &s;pawn where it will be devoured; and what a large portion of the human race are born merely to be &s;wept prematurely away. Does not this wa&s;te of budding life emphatical|ly a&s;&s;ert, that it is not men, but man, who&s;e
<PB N="201" REF="031653_0200_0fed903a583f4680">
pre&s;ervation is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the completion of the grand plan of the univer&s;e? Children peep into exi&s;tence, &s;uffer, and die; men play like moths about a candle, and &s;ink into the flame: war, and "the thou&s;and ills which fle&s;h is heir to," mow them down in &s;hoals, whil&s;t the more cruel prejudices of &s;ociety pal|&s;ies exi&s;tence, introducing not le&s;s &s;ure, though &s;lower decay.</P>
<P>The ca&s;tle was heavy and gloomy; yet the grounds about it were laid out with &s;ome ta&s;te; a walk, winding under the &s;hade of lofty trees, led to a regularly built, and animated town.</P>
<P>I cro&s;&s;ed the draw-bridge, and entered to &s;ee this &s;hell of a court in miniature, mounting ponderous &s;tairs, it would be a &s;oleci&s;m to &s;ay a flight, up which a regiment of men might have marched, &s;houldering their firelocks, to exerci&s;e in va&s;t galleries, where all the genera|tions of the princes of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el might have been mu&s;tered rank and file, though not the phantoms of all the wretched they had bartered to &s;upport their &s;tate, unle&s;s the&s;e airy &s;ub&s;tan|ces could &s;hrink and expand, like Miltons de|vils, to &s;uit the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The &s;ight of the pre&s;ence-chamber&punc; and of the canopy to &s;hade the <HI>fauteuil,</HI> which aped a throne, made me &s;mile. All the world is a &s;tage, thought I; and few are there in it who do not play the part they have learnt by rote; and tho&s;e who do not, &s;eem marks &s;et up to be

<P>Waiting for our hor&s;es, we were amu&s;ed by ob&s;erving the dre&s;s of the women, which was very grote&s;que and unwieldy. The fal&s;e noti|on of beauty which prevails here, as well as in Denmark, I &s;hould think very inconvenient in &s;ummer, as it con&s;i&s;ts in giving a rotundity to a certain part of the body, not the mo&s;t &s;lim, when nature has done her part. This dutch prejudice often leads them to toil under the weight of &s;ome ten or a dozen petricoats, which with an enormous ba&s;ket, literally &s;peak|ing, as a bonnet, or a &s;traw hat of dimen&s;ions equally gigantic, almo&s;t completely concealing the human form, as well as face divine, often worth &s;hewing&mdash;&s;till they looked clean, and tript along, as it were, before the wind, with a weight of tackle that I could &s;carcely have lifted. Many of the country girls, I met, ap|peared to me pretty, that is, to have fine com|plexions, &s;parkling eyes, and a kind of arch, hoyden playfulne&s;s which di&s;tingui&s;hes the vil|lage coquette. The &s;wains, in their &s;unday trim, attended &s;ome of the&s;e fair ones, in a more &s;louching pace, though their dre&s;s was not &s;o cumber&s;ome. The women &s;eem to take the lead in poli&s;hing the manners every where, that being the only way to better their condi|tion.</P>
<P>From what I have &s;een throughout my jour|ney,
<PB N="203" REF="031653_0202_0fed903d97cd4300">
I do not think the &s;ituation of the poor in England is much, if at all &s;uperior to that of the &s;ame cla&s;s in different parts of the world; and in Ireland, I am &s;ure, it is much inferiour. I allude to the former &s;tate of England; for at pre&s;ent the accumulation of national wealth on|ly increa&s;es the cares of the poor, and hardens the hearts of the rich, in &s;pite of the highly ex|tolled rage for alms-giving.</P>
<P>You know that I have always been an ene|my to what is termed charity, becau&s;e timid bi|gots endeavouring thus to cover their <HI>&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts,</HI> do violence to ju&s;tice, till, acting the demi-god, they forget that they are men. And there are others who do not even think of laying up a trea&s;ure in heaven, who&s;e benevolence is mere|ly tyranny in di&s;gui&s;e they a&s;&s;i&s;t the mo&s;t worth|le&s;s, becau&s;e the mo&s;t &s;ervile, and term them helple&s;s only in proportion to their fawn|ing.</P>
<P>After leaving Sle&s;wick, we pa&s;&s;ed through &s;everal pretty towns; Itzchol particularly plea|&s;ed me; and the country &s;till wearing the &s;ame a&s;pect, was improved by the appearance of more trees and enclo&s;ures. But what gratified me mo&s;t, was the population. I was weary of travelling four or five hours, never meeting a carriage, and &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ly a pea&s;ant&mdash;and then to &s;top at &s;uch wretched huts, as I had &s;een in Sweden, was &s;urely &s;ufficient to chill any heart, awake to &s;ympathy, and throw a gloom over my favourite &s;ubject of contemplation, the fu|ture improvement of the world.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="031653_0203_0fed90420d961e70">The farm-hou&s;es, likewi&s;e, with the huge &s;tables, into which we drove, whil&s;t the hor&s;es were putting to, or baiting, were very clean and commodious. The rooms, with a door in|to this hall like &s;table and &s;torehou&s;e in one, were decent; and there was a compactne&s;s in the appearance of the whole family lying thus &s;nugly together under the &s;ame roof, that car|ried my fancy back to the primitive times, which probably never exi&s;ted with &s;uch a golden lu&s;tre as the animated imagination lends, when only able to &s;eize the prominent fea|tures.</P>
<P>At one of them, a pretty young woman, with langui&s;hing eyes, of cele&s;tial blue, con|ducted us into a very neat parlour; and ob|&s;erving how loo&s;ely, and lightly, my little girl was clad, began to pity her in the &s;weete&s;t ac|cents, regardle&s;s of the ro&s;y down of health on her cheeks. This &s;ame dam&s;el was dre&s;&s;ed, it was &s;unday, with ta&s;te, and even coquetry, in a cotten jacket, ornamented with knots of blue ribbon, fancifully di&s;po&s;ed to give life to her fine complexion. I loitered a little to admire her, for every ge&s;ture was graceful; and, a|mid&s;t the other villagers, &s;he looked like a gar|den lilly &s;uddenly rearing its head among&s;t grain, and corn-flowers. As the hou&s;e was &s;mall, I gave her a piece of money, rather larger than it was my cu&s;tom to give to the female waiters; for I could not prevail on her to fit down; which &s;he received with a &s;mile; yet took care to give it, in my pre&s;ence, to a girl, who had

brought the child a &s;lice of bread; by which I perceived that &s;he was the mi&s;tre&s;s, or daugh|ter, of the hou&s;e&mdash;and without doubt the <HI>belle</HI> of the village. There was, in &s;hort, an ap|pearance of chearful indu&s;try, and of that de|gree of comfort which &s;hut out mi&s;ery, in all the little hamlets as I approached Hamburg, which agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed me.</P>
<P>The &s;hort jackets which the women wear here, as well as in France, are not only more becoming to the per&s;on, but much better cal|culated for women who have ru&s;tic or hou&s;hold employment, than the long gowns worn in England, dangling in the dirt.</P>
<P>All the inns on the road were better than I expected, though the &s;oftne&s;s of the beds &s;till hara&s;&s;ed me, and prevented my finding the re&s;t I was frequently in want of, to enable me to bear the fatigue of the next day. The charges were moderate, and the people very civil, with a certain hone&s;t hilarity and inde|pendent &s;pirit in their manner, which almo&s;t made me forget that they were inn-keepers, a &s;et of men, waiters, ho&s;te&s;&s;es, chamber-maids, &amp;c. down to the o&s;tler, who&s;e cunning &s;ervili|ty, in England, I think particularly di&s;gu&s;t|ing.</P>

character of the man is lo&s;t in the hamburger. Always afraid of the encroachments of their dani&s;h neighbours, that is, anxiou&s;ly appre|hen&s;ive of their &s;haring the golden harve&s;t of commerce with them, or taking a little of the trade off their hands, though they have more than they know what to do with, they are ever on the watch, till their very eyes lo&s;e all expre&s;&s;ion, excepting the prying glance of &s;u&s;|picion.</P>
<P>The gates of Hamburg are &s;hut at &s;even, in the winter, and nine in the &s;ummer, le&s;t &s;ome &s;trangers, who come to traffic in Hamburg, &s;hould prefer living, and con&s;equently, &s;o ex|actly do they calculate, &s;pend their money out of the walls of the hamburger's world.

<P>Madame La Fayette left altona the day I arrived, to endeavour, at Vienna, to obtain the enlargement of her hu&s;band, or permi&s;&s;ion to &s;hare his pri&s;on. She lived in a lodging up two pair of &s;tairs, without a &s;ervant, her two daughters chearfully a&s;&s;i&s;ting; cha&s;ing, as well as her&s;elf, to de&s;cend to any thing before un|nece&s;&s;ary obligations. During her pro&s;perity, and con&s;equent idlene&s;s, &s;he did not, I am told, enjoy a good &s;tate of health, having a train of nervous complaints which, though they have not a name, unle&s;s the &s;ignificant word <HI>ennui</HI> be borrowed, had an exi&s;tence in the higher french circles; but adver&s;ity and virtuous ex|ertions put the&s;e ills to flight, and di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her of a devil, who de&s;erves the appellation of legion.</P>
<P>Madame Genlis, al&s;o, re&s;ided at Altona &s;ome time, under an a&s;&s;umed name, with many o|ther &s;ufferers of le&s;s note, though higher rank.

becoming a <HI>traiteur,</HI> they were both comfort|ably &s;upported by the profit ari&s;ing from his in|du&s;try. Many noble in&s;tances of the attach|ment of &s;ervants to their unfortunate ma&s;ters, have come to my knowledge both here and in France, and touched my heart, the greate&s;t delight of which is to di&s;cover human virtue.</P>
<P>At Altona, a pre&s;ident of one of the <HI>ci-devant</HI> parliaments keeps an ordinary, in the french &s;tyle; and his wife, with chearful dignity, &s;ub|mits to her fate, though &s;he is arrived at an age when people &s;eldom relinqui&s;h their prejudices. A girl who waits there brought a dozen <HI>double louis d'or</HI> concealed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n her clothes, at the ri&s;k of her life, from France; which &s;he pre&s;erves, le&s;t &s;ickne&s;s, or any other di&s;tre&s;s, &s;hould over|take her mi&s;tre&s;s, "who," &s;he ob&s;erved, "was not accu&s;tomed to hard&s;hips." This hou&s;e was particularly recommended to me by an acquaintance of your's, the author of the American Farmer's Letters. I generally dine in company with him: and the gentleman whom I have already mentioned, is often di|verted by our declamations again&s;t commerce, when we compare notes re&s;pecting the charac|teri&s;tics of the hamburgers. "Why, madam," &s;aid he to me one day, <Q>your will not meet with a man who has any calf to his leg; bo|dy and &s;oul, mu&s;cles and heart, are equally &s;hrivelled up by a thir&s;t of gain. There is nothing generous even in their youthful pa&s;|&s;ions; profit is their only &s;timulus, and cal|culations the &s;ole employment of their facul|ties; unle&s;s we except &s;ome gro&s;s animal

<P>Perhaps you may al&s;o think us too &s;evere; but I mu&s;t add, that the more I &s;aw of the manners of Hamburg, the more was confirm|ed in my opinion relative to the baleful effect of exten&s;ive &s;peculations on the moral character. Men are &s;trange machines; and their whole &s;y&s;tem of morality is in general held together by one grand principle, which lo&s;es its force the moment they allow them&s;elves to break with impunity over the bounds which &s;ecured their &s;elf-re&s;pect. A man cea&s;es to love hu|manity, and then individuals, as he advances in the cha&s;e after wealth; as one cla&s;hes with his intere&s;t, the other with his plea&s;ures: to bu&s;ine&s;s, as it is termed, every thing mu&s;t give way; nay, is &s;acrificed; and all the endearing charities of citizen, hu&s;band, father, brother, become empty names. But&mdash;but what? Why, to &s;nap the chain of thought, I mu&s;t &s;ay fare|well. Ca&s;&s;andra was not the only prophete&s;s who&s;e warning voice has been di&s;regarded.

<P>MY lodgings at Altona are tolerably com|fortable, though not in any proportion to the price I pay; but, owing to the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, all the nece&s;&s;aries of life are here extravagantly dear. Con&s;idering it as a temporary re&s;idence, the chief inconvenience of which, I am inclined to complain, is the rough &s;treets that mu&s;t be pa&s;&s;ed before Marguerite and the child can reach a level road.</P>
<P>The views of the Elbe, in the vicinity of the town, are plea&s;ant, particularly as the pro&s;pects here afford &s;o little variety. I at|tempted to de&s;cend, and walk clo&s;e to the wa|ter edge; but there was no path; and the &s;mell of glue, hanging to dry, an exten&s;ive manufactory of which is carried on clo&s;e to the beach, I found extremely di&s;agreeable. But to commerce every thing mu&s;t give way; pro|fit and profit are the only &s;peculations&mdash;&mdash;"double&mdash;&mdash;double, toil and trouble." I have &s;eldom entered a &s;hady walk without being &s;oon obliged to turn a&s;ide to make room for the rope-makers; and the only tree, I have &s;een, that appeared to be planted by the hand of ta&s;te, is in the church-yard, to &s;hade the tomb of the poet Klop&s;tock's wife.</P>

<P>The moving picture, con&s;i&s;ting of large ve&s;|&s;els and &s;mall-craft, which are continually changing their po&s;ition with the tide, renders this noble river, the vital &s;tream of Hamburg, very intere&s;ting; and the windings have &s;ome|times a very fine effect, two or three turns be|ing vi&s;ible, at once, inter&s;ecting the flat mea|dows: a &s;udden bend often increa&s;ing the mag|nitude of the river; and the &s;ilvery expan&s;e, &s;carcely gliding, though bearing on its bo&s;om &s;o much trea&s;ure, looks, for a moment, like a tranquil lake.</P>
<P>Nothing can be &s;tronger than the contra&s;t which this flat country and &s;trand afford, com|pared with the mountains, and rocky coa&s;t, I have lately dwelt &s;o much among. In fancy I return to a favourite &s;pot, where I &s;eemed to have retired from man and wretchedne&s;s; but the din of trade drags me back to all the care I left behind, when lo&s;t in &s;ublime emotions. Rocks a&s;piring towards the heavens, and, as it were, &s;hutting out &s;orrow, &s;urrounded me, whil&s;t peace appeared to &s;teal along the lake to calm my bo&s;om, modulating the wind that a|gitated the neighbouring poplars.

<P>PRIVATE bu&s;ine&s;s and cares have fre|quently &s;o ab&s;orbed me, as to prevent my obtaining all the information, during this jour|ney, which the novelty of the &s;cene would have afforded, had my attention been continu|ally awake to inquiry. This in&s;en&s;ibility to pre&s;ent objects I have often had occa&s;ion to la|ment, &s;ince I have been preparing the&s;e letters for the pre&s;s; but, as a per&s;on of any thought naturally con&s;iders the hi&s;tory of a &s;trange coun|try to contra&s;t the former with the pre&s;ent &s;tate of its manners, a conviction of the increa&s;ing knowledge and happine&s;s of the kingdoms I pa&s;|&s;ed through, was perpetually the re&s;ult of my comparative reflections.</P>
<P>The poverty of the poor, in Sweden, ren|ders the civilization very partial; and &s;lavery has retarded the improvement of every cla&s;s in Denmark; yet both are advancing; and the gigantic evils of de&s;poti&s;m and anarchy have in a great mea&s;ure vani&s;hed before the meliorating manners of Europe. Innumerable evils &s;till re|main, it is true, to afflict the human inve&s;tigat|or, and hurry the benevolent reformer into a labyrinth of errour, who aims at de&s;troying prejudices quickly which only time can root out, as the public opinion becomes &s;ubject to rea&s;on.</P>

be the growth of each particular &s;oil, and the gradual fruit of the ripening under&s;tanding of the nation, matured by time, not forced by an unnatural fermentation. And, to convince me that &s;uch a change is gaining ground, with accelerating pace, the view I have had of &s;ocie|ty, during my northern journey, would have been &s;ufficient, had I not previou&s;ly con&s;idered the grand cau&s;es which combine to carry man|kind forward, and dimini&s;h the &s;um of human mi&s;ery.</P>

<P>NORWAY, according to geometrical mea&s;ure, is <HI>202</HI> miles in length. In breadth it is very unequal. The common Nor|way mile contains <HI>24,000</HI> yards Engli&s;h mea&s;ur|ment.</P>
<P>Norway is reckoned to contain <HI>7558</HI> quadrate miles: it is divided into four parts. There are four grand bailiffs, and four bi&s;hops. The four chief towns are Chri&s;tiania, Thordhiem, Bergen, and Chri&s;tian&s;and. Its natural products are wood, &s;ilver, copper, and iron, a little gold has been found, fi&s;h, marble, and the &s;kins of &s;everal animals. The exportation exceeds the importati|on. The balance in favour of Norway, in the year <HI>1767,</HI> was about <HI>476,085</HI> rixdollars, <HI>95, 217</HI>l &s;terling. It has been increa&s;ing ever &s;ince. The &s;ilver mines of Kong&s;berg yield &s;ilver to the amount of <HI>350,000</HI> rixdollars, <HI>70,000</HI>l. &s;terling; but it is a&s;&s;erted, that this &s;um is not &s;ufficient to defray the expences of working them. Kong&s;berg is the only inland town, and contains <HI>10,000</HI> &s;ouls.</P>
<P>The copper mines at Rorraas yield about <HI>4000</HI> &s;hip-pound a year; a &s;hip-pound is <HI>320</HI> pounds: the yearly profit amounts to <HI>150,000</HI> rixdollars, <HI>30,000</HI>l. &s;terling. There are fifteen or &s;ixteen iron works in Norway, which produce iron to the value of <HI>400,000</HI> rixdollars, <HI>80,000</HI>l. per annum.</P>
<P><PB REF="031653_0221_0fed907ab4e03d58">The exportation of &s;alted and dried fi&s;h is very con&s;iderable. In the year <HI>1786</HI> the returns for its exportation amounted to <HI>749,200</HI> rixdollars, <HI>169.840</HI>l.</P>
