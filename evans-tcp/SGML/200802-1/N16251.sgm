<OPENER><SALUTE>My loving, and mo&s;t tenderly beloved <HI>PARISHIONERS.</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is almo&s;t needle&s;s to remind you of the anxious concern, generally attending the final &s;eparation of friends, neighbours and acquaintance. This concern is augmented by the uncommon warmth of friend&s;hip; the intimacy of neighbourhood, and the length of time, wherein the parties have been acquainted with each other.</P>
<P>Though I have delivered two public di&s;cour&s;es to you, upon the occa&s;ion of my removal, &s;till I could not depart without leaving with you &s;omewhat further of my &s;entiments and advice committed to paper, hoping they will be con&s;idered as my la&s;t, and in &s;ome &s;en&s;e as my dying expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Born as I have been and nurtured among you, hav|ing led your devotions almo&s;t twenty-eight years, of which term, more than twenty-four years I have been in holy orders, and have (within and without my mi&s;|&s;ion) admini&s;tered the holy Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, to a great number of devout and exemplary communicants; have admitted into Chri&s;tianity by Bapti&s;m no le&s;s than 122 per&s;ons of riper years, and 1749 infants; have joined in marriage 176 couple; have committed to the &s;ilent grave in full hope of their ri&s;ing again at the la&s;t day, the bodies of 219 de|cea&s;ed per&s;ons; have received by profe&s;&s;ion, into the bo&s;om of our excellent church 215 heads of families. From the year 1759 to the pre&s;ent time, the number of conformi&s;ts to the church has increa&s;ed from 75 to more than 280 families, exclu&s;ive of the many that
<PB N="4" REF="020835_0003_0FB138BF15802680">
have emigrated, and the few that have apo&s;tatized: Within the before mentioned period, I have (upon a moderate computation) travelled by land and by wa|ter, more than the extent of three times the circumfe|rence of the terraqueous globe.</P>
<P>The perfect unanimity &s;ub&s;i&s;ting for &s;uch a length of time both among the people, and between the peo|ple and their mini&s;ter, has been exten&s;ively ob&s;erved and mentioned, to the great honour of my people, and &s;atisfaction of my&s;elf. You have indeed exhibit|ed a laudable example of charity and concord; an ex|ample, which has been admired by all, extolled by many imitated by few!</P>
<P>How &s;hall I find words to expre&s;s my gratitude for the numerous and e&s;timable favours that I have re|ceived at your hands! Your undi&s;&s;embled friend&s;hip&mdash; your unremitted benevolence&mdash;your unmerited can|dour&mdash;your unlimited approbation, has made impre&s;&s;|ions on my mind too deep to be era&s;ed by the greate&s;t change of circum&s;tances&mdash;too durable to be annihila|ted by the hand of time: for every mark of your cor|dial love, un&s;haken fidelity and e&s;teem, candour and genero&s;ity, zeal for the &s;ervice of God and his church, be plea&s;ed to accept of my &s;incere&s;t acknowledgments, my warme&s;t gratitude. Whither&s;oever Heaven &s;hall guide my &s;teps, the dear remembrance of my former pari&s;h will never lo&s;e its place in my mind: a &s;en&s;e of your affection and beneficence, will remain deeply en|graves on the fle&s;hy table of my heart.</P>
<P>Not is my gratitude confined to tho&s;e of our own church only, many people of other profe&s;&s;ions of re|ligion have &s;hewn the mo&s;t lively demon&s;trations of a derential regard for me, and of courteous benevo|lence towards me: this regard and benevolence, merit
<PB N="5" REF="020835_0004_0FB138C208220BE8">
the warme&s;t gratitude of which my heart is &s;u&s;cepti|ble, and &s;hall not be forgotten as long as memory holds a &s;eat in my brain.</P>
<P>Never, perhaps, was a mini&s;ter and people &s;eparated with more reluctance on both &s;ides; never, perhaps, was their mutual regret more equally balanced. As our e&s;teem and affection have been reciprocal, &s;o is the grief of our parting. Nor was I ever &s;en&s;ible, till the pre&s;ent cri&s;is, to what height your good will and re&s;|pect for me have ari&s;en.</P>
<P>But having with much &s;atisfaction and unde&s;erved applau&s;e expended the prime and be&s;t part of my life among you, and in your &s;ervice; it can by no means be expected, that we can much longer remain in the pre&s;ent life, reciprocally a comfort and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to each other. Should my life, and the lives of &s;uch of you as are nearly coeval with me, be &s;o lengthened out as to complete a full century, how &s;wiftly would the remaining fifty years glide away! How &s;oon would the la&s;t half of the century expire! And even much the greater part of this &s;hort remaining time, would be evil days and years, in which we &s;hould truly &s;ay that we had no plea&s;ure. Since then the &s;hort re|maining &s;pace, that we can expect or even wi&s;h for, mu&s;t pa&s;s away and forever di&s;appear like the wind, or like the chaff which the wind driveth away; &s;ince time it&s;elf is as vain and fleeting as a &s;hadow, a vapour or a dream, and the remaining part of our lives, can be but as it were, "dream of a dream, and &s;hadow of a &s;hade." How can the difference be thought very material, betwixt the parting of friends at the pre&s;ent time, and their parting twenty or forty years hence? Nay, on &s;ome accounts, it is more eligible to part from our friends at the middle &s;tage of life, when old
<PB N="6" REF="020835_0005_0FB138C2D20D9118">
age and infirmities but begin to oppre&s;s us, than to dwell with them till we become (for rea&s;ons very ob|vious) a burden and vexation to each other. But &s;till it is grievous, it is melancholy, it is painful, for us to be &s;eparated; and would it not be as much, or more painful, to be &s;eparated after we have dwelt together twenty or forty years longer? Length of time endears friends more clo&s;ely to each other, and the interchange of benign offices, &s;trengthens the bands of amity, in &s;ome proportion to the time lent us by indulgent Heaven, partly for the purpo&s;es of exerci&s;ing tho&s;e offices. The well known brevity and uncertainty of life, teach us the mo&s;t obvious le&s;&s;on of re&s;ignation, at bidding adieu to our deare&s;t friends. For the &s;hort|ne&s;s and precariou&s;ne&s;s of life, clearly di&s;play to our &s;ight, the vanity of all temporal enjoyments, the in|&s;ufficiency of all friend&s;hips and connexions on this &s;ide of eternity, to &s;atisfy a rational being, or to afford complete happine&s;s to a mind immortal. Therefore let us dry up our tears, and like per&s;ons of &s;ound rea&s;on, give all the&s;e arguments their proper weight, and bid farewell to each other with entire &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will of Heaven, with a decent chearfulne&s;s, and a lively hope of meeting again in a better country, in a hou&s;e not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens.</P>
<P>As to the motives inducing me to a removal. There is a general accu&s;ation thrown out again&s;t the mini&s;ters of all parties and religions (whether in je&s;t or earne&s;t I know not) that they are wholly actuated by worldly intere&s;t, by an in&s;atiable de&s;ire of tempor|al gain. I hope mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel do not in gen|eral de&s;erve &s;uch &s;evere cen&s;ure. The clergy of our Church I am well convinced do not. To my&s;elf I know &s;uch an ob&s;ervation cannot be applied: and
<PB N="7" REF="020835_0006_0FB138C9410759F8">
hope I have demon&s;trated by many years conduct, and &s;hall hereafter demon&s;trate, that I am not chiefly guid|ed by a motive &s;o mean and &s;ordid. And I cannot but query, whether, laymen who are mo&s;t liberal of &s;uch reflections on the clergy do not judge us accord|ing to &s;ome avaricious principles lurking in their own brea&s;ts? Whether they would not I &s;ay (in our &s;itua|tion) act from the &s;ame &s;ini&s;ter views, which they at|tribute to us? It is rea&s;onable, and a duty incumbent on every man to have regard to his worldly intere&s;t, in a certain re&s;tricted degree, it is the will of God that we &s;hould by proper means make provi&s;ion for the de|cent and even creditable &s;upport of our&s;elves and our families; and as far as is in our power by hone&s;t means, to leave &s;omewhat behind us for the benefit of our families after our decea&s;e. But this temporal in|tere&s;t mu&s;t not by any means be the &s;ole or even the chief motive of our actions. God forbid, that any man, much more that any mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel, &s;hould &s;et a greater value on this world than on Hea|ven! on time than eternity! The whole world in competition with one &s;oul, is as the &s;mall drop of the bucket, the imperceptible du&s;t of the balance.</P>
<P>A weighty inducement to my removal aro&s;e from gratitude to the pious and venerable &s;ociety for the propagation of the go&s;pel in foreign parts, who have been my principal and mo&s;t con&s;tant &s;upporters. Rea&s;on and gratitude bound me to pay an high regard to their commands. They directed me to remove my&s;elf to Digby in Nova-Scotia.</P>
<P>What influence the difference of con&s;titution be|tween Connecticut and Nova-Scotia may have on me, is not proper for me to mention.</P>
<P>The people of my new mi&s;&s;ion, though earne&s;tly
<PB N="8" REF="020835_0007_0FB138CDA4550E50">
de&s;irous of enjoying the benefits of public wor&s;hip and &s;acraments, had no mini&s;ter of any denomination whatever of con&s;tant abode within the compa&s;s of eighteen miles&punc; more than three hundred families di&s;|per&s;ed through a large extent of country, will receive a &s;upply of their &s;piritual nece&s;&s;ities by my new appoint|ment. In&s;omuch, that there can be no doubt, of my being able to do more for the advancement of God's glory, the kingdom of Chri&s;t, and pro&s;perity of the church in my new re&s;idence, than among you; how then can I be blamed for the mea&s;ures I have taken?</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of the place, and the di&s;po&s;ition of the inhabitants, were &s;trong per&s;ua&s;ions with me, to expend the remainder of my days here. Every one hath his particular opinion and humour. Let others think and &s;peak as they plea&s;e of this place, I never &s;aw a place or people more agreeable to me in all points.</P>
<P>Nova-Scotia is a penin&s;ula, is &s;ituate in a happy climate, one of their be&s;t towns is Annapolis, from which Digby is di&s;tant about eigteeen miles. Digby is &s;ituate on a ri&s;ing ground, upon the Ba&s;on and in the county of Annapolis Royal; and contains perhaps about one hundred families. On one &s;ide of the town is a mo&s;t amiable pro&s;pect of the Ba&s;on, and a line of hou&s;es and farms, upon the adjacent &s;hore, around the whole; on the other &s;ide is an agreeable walk, through plea&s;ant woodlands, for about &s;ix miles to St. Mary's Bay; thence continues an agreeable pa&s;&s;age by land or water, upon the Bay of St. Mary, for twelve miles further, till we come to Si&s;&s;aboo, a fruitful village, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a courteous, well-di&s;po&s;ed people. The &s;ituation, and air of Digby, is exceeding healthy, and the &s;oil is far from barren. I have &s;een &s;ome in&s;tances
<PB N="9" REF="020835_0008_0FB138CEE6F54828">
of vegetable productions, in that place, &s;urprizing and almo&s;t incredible. The harbour is good; with a ve|ry high tide, and a plentiful &s;upply of fi&s;h of many kinds.</P>
<P>But none of the&s;e circum&s;tances recommend the country to my choice, &s;o much as the worthine&s;s and good di&s;po&s;ition of the Inhabitants. Gentle and amia|ble, kind and ho&s;pitable, mu&s;t every unprejudiced per|&s;on allow them to be. Neither are they addicted to &s;uch vice and prophanene&s;s, as the people of Nova-Scotia are throughout the &s;tates repre&s;ented to be guil|ty of. During the whole time of my re&s;idence at Digby, I have not heard one ob&s;cene word, and but very few prophane words. In paying regard to the times, places and in&s;titutions of divine wor&s;hip, they are equal, or &s;uperior, to the greate&s;t part of the &s;ea|port or populous towns of New-England. To all this may be added, as a very important benefit to the &s;ettlers, that much the greater part of the idle, di&s;&s;o|lute, litigious and helple&s;s people, &s;uch as were in all probability likely to become a public charge, &s;uch as would not labour, or were inclined to more profligate morals, have emigrated to the &s;tates, chiefly to New-York: and there is great hope, that the few of this character remaining among us, will &s;hortly follow their example: In who&s;e &s;tead, hone&s;t, indu&s;trious people from Europe, and from the &s;tates, charmed with the advantages of the place, and the ingenuou&s;ne&s;s of the people, are coming in, and bid fair to be u&s;eful members to the town, and the province.</P>
<P>The great and e&s;&s;ential principles of chri&s;tianity I have &s;o con&s;tantly inculcated in my admini&s;trations, that it is needle&s;s to repeat them; &s;uch as a rational, firm, well e&s;tabli&s;hed faith, an uniform holine&s;s of life,
<PB N="10" REF="020835_0009_0FB138D05D944018">
purity of heart, charity, mercy, meekne&s;s, patience, temperance, ju&s;tice, and all other fruits of the &s;pirit. The&s;e general and well known &s;ubjects I will omit and give you a few words of advice upon &s;ome more par|ticular matters.</P>
<P>Let me be&s;eech you then, by all our pa&s;t friend&s;hip and pre&s;ent regret, to attend con&s;tantly and devoutly on the public wor&s;hip of God; when you cannot have one in holy orders to officiate among&s;t you, &s;till meet together, and read the common prayer and &s;ome good printed &s;ermons among&s;t your&s;elves. I have found it an unexceptionable ob&s;ervation, that where ever a con|gregation make a con&s;tant practice of celebrating God's wor&s;hip upon every Lord's day, they have more reli|gious knowledge, a more active &s;pirit of devotion, they have more regard for God, his word, his mini&s;ters and his in&s;titutions, than is to be found among other people. In &s;mall congregations who can but &s;eldom have a man in holy orders among them, the meeting together and wor&s;hipping God, is a laudable and edi|fying practice; a practice which cannot be too much commended or encouraged; and which has pre&s;erved an under&s;tanding of Chri&s;tianity, and a &s;pirit of ration|al devotion among&s;t the epi&s;copal people of Connec|ticut.</P>
<P>If my la&s;t words to you, and as it were my dying ad|vice, can have influence upon you, I intreat you never to admit of any material alterations in your form of public devotion.&mdash;Indeed to admit of no other alter|ations, than &s;uch &s;mall ones, as revolutions may render ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. Even &s;mall, unnece&s;&s;ary or wan|ton innovations, are more dangerous, and more per|nicious, than is generally imagined. When a &s;pirit of idle innovation is let loo&s;e, none can foretell when
<PB N="11" REF="020835_0010_0FB138D1DD936558">
or where it will cea&s;e. When a con&s;titution in church or &s;tate becomes di&s;&s;olved or unhinged, it is no ea&s;y matter to re&s;ettle it.&mdash;Your &s;afety and your honour, con&s;i&s;ts in a firm and &s;teady adherence to the church of England&mdash;&s;hould you once loo&s;e that church, you will not ea&s;ily find a better.</P>
<P>The public has been already pre&s;ented with three new books of common prayer, the Methodi&s;t, the So|cinian, and another without a particular name, and more are daily expected. In all that I have &s;een, they appear to have rejected the very be&s;t parts of the &s;er|vice of the church of England. Some have reprobat|ed two Creeds entirely, and an e&s;&s;ential article of the Apo&s;tle's Creed; &s;ome have expunged the Gloria Pa|tri and have mended the Lord's Prayer&mdash;&s;ome have aboli&s;hed all Holidays, becau&s;e for&s;ooth they have been abu&s;ed; not con&s;idering that the &s;ame argument would hold equally conclu&s;ive again&s;t the Lord's Day, both the Sacraments, and all that is good.</P>
<P>Could the numerous authors of the new common Prayers agree in one, uniform book for divine Wor|&s;hip, like that of the Engli&s;h Church; they could, with a better face, invite you to comply with them: But &s;hould they agree in one form, yet their be&s;t com|pilers could not produce a form, by any means, equal to the liturgy of the church, which is the collected wi&s;|dom of ages and nations.</P>
<P>If any &s;hould care &s;o little for God's wor&s;hip, and be &s;o void of the chri&s;tian temper, as to think the pray|ers of the church too lengthy, I &s;hould think it ab&s;urd to enjoin a &s;horter form upon the Church to plea&s;e them. The per&s;on who thinks an hour and an half in the forenoon&punc; and an hour and a quarter in the after|noon, of one day in the &s;even, too much time for the
<PB N="12" REF="020835_0011_0FB138D363CCCF68">
wor&s;hip of God would be be&s;t &s;atisfied with no wor|&s;hip at all.</P>
<P>If the liturgy of our church can be altered for the better, how comes it to pa&s;s that the united councils of the church and &s;tate in England (the mo&s;t judicious nation in the world) have not found it out and made the requi&s;ite alterations? When you &s;hall be enticed to adopt a new form of wor&s;hip, follow the advice of the wi&s;e&s;t of men: <HI>Meddle not with them that are given to change, for their calamity &s;hall ri&s;e &s;uddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both?</HI></P>
<P>Suffer me to exhort you to pre&s;erve unity and godly love among your&s;elves, peace with your neighbours, and unity with all men. <HI>Finally, brethren, farewell Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace, and the God of love and peace &s;hall be with you.</HI></P>
