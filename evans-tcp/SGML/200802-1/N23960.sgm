<P>NO books whatever are more in&s;tructive and entertaining than books of Travels. They are particularly well adapted to young people. They &s;atisfy that eager thir&s;t after knowledge, which is found very &s;trong in early life, and they intere&s;t the mind as much as a novel. They make it u&s;efully inqui&s;itive, and furni&s;h it with matter for reflection.</P>
<P>With regard to the following &s;election, it is only nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that perhaps there never was brought together, in &s;o &s;mall a compa&s;s, in any language, a more copious collection of rational entertain|ment, than will be met with in the&s;e vol|umes.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. I. OF THE VOLCANOS IN ICELAND, AND PAR|TICULARLY MOUNT HECLA.</HEAD>
<P>UPON our arrival in Iceland, on the 28th of Au|gu&s;t, 1772, we &s;aw a pro&s;pect before us, which, tho' not plea&s;ing, was uncommon and &s;urprizing. What|ever pre&s;ented it&s;elf to our view bore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|va&s;tation and our eyes, accu&s;to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> the plea&s;ing coa&s;ts of England and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> on|ly the ve&s;tiges of the operation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> ancient!</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="031692_0008_0FEE0C813A2E60F0">
The de&s;cription of a country, where, quite clo&s;e to the &s;ea, you perceive almo&s;t nothing but craggy cliffs vetrified by fire, and where the eye lo&s;es it&s;elf in high and rocky mountains, covered with eternal &s;now, can|not po&s;&s;ibly produce &s;uch emotions, as at fir&s;t &s;ight might entirely prepo&s;&s;e&s;s the thinking &s;pectator. It is true, beauty is plea&s;ing both to our eyes and our thoughts, but wonderful nature often makes the mo&s;t la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>We ca&s;t anchor not far from the dwelling-place of the celebrated Sturle&s;on, where we found two tracks of lava, of which the la&s;t in particular was remarkable, &s;ince we found there, be&s;ides a large field covered with lava, which mu&s;t have been liquid in the highe&s;t de|gree, whole mountains of turf. Chance had directed us exactly to a &s;pot, on which we could, better than on any other part of Iceland, con&s;ider the operations of a fire, which had laid wa&s;te a tract of &s;ixty or &s;eventy Engli&s;h miles. We &s;pent &s;everal days here in exam|ining every thing with &s;o much the more plea&s;ure, as we found our&s;elves, as it were, in a new world.</P>
<P>We had now &s;een almo&s;t all the effects of a volcano, except the crater from which the fire had proceeded. In order, therefore to examine this likewi&s;e, we under|took a journey of twelve days; to Mount Hecla it&s;elf. We travelled about 300 miles over an uninterrupted
<PB N="9" REF="031692_0009_0FEE0C88E4978DC0">
trac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of lava, and gained the plea&s;ure of being the fir&s;t who ever reached the &s;ummit of this celebrated volca|no. The cau&s;e that no one had been there before, is partly founded in &s;uper&s;tition, and partly in the ex|treme difficulty of the a&s;cent, before the la&s;t eruption of fire. There was not one of our company who did not wi&s;h to have his clothes a little &s;inged, only for the &s;ake of &s;eeing Hecla in a blaze; and we almo&s;t flattered our&s;elves with this hope, for the Bi&s;hop of Skallholt had informed us by letter, in the night between the 5th and 6th of September, the day before our arri|val, that flames had proceeded from it; but now the mountain was more quiet than we wi&s;hed. We how|ever pa&s;&s;ed our time very agreeably before one o'clock in the morning till two in the afternoon, in vi&s;iting the mountain. We were even &s;o happy, that the clouds, which covered the greate&s;t part of it, di&s;per&s;ed towards the evening, and procured us the mo&s;t exten&s;ive pro&s;|pect imaginable.</P>
<P>The mountain is &s;omething above 5000 feet high, and &s;eparates at the top into three points, of which that in the middle is the highe&s;t. The mo&s;t incon&s;id|erable part of the mountain con&s;i&s;ts of lava, the re&s;t is a&s;hes, with hard &s;olid &s;tones thrown from the craters, together with &s;ome pumice &s;tones, of which we found only a &s;mall piece, with a little native &s;ulphur. A
<PB N="10" REF="031692_0010_0FEE0C8A6FDDD860">
de&s;cription of the various kinds of &s;tones to be found here, would be too prolix and partly unintelli|gible.</P>
<P>Among&s;t many other craters or openings, four were peculiarly remarkable; the fir&s;t, the lava of which had taken the form of &s;tacks of chimneys, half broken down; another from which water had &s;treamed; a third, all the &s;tones of which were red as brick; and la&s;tly, one from which the lava had bur&s;t forth into a &s;tream, and was divided at &s;ome di&s;tance into three arms.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid before, that we were not &s;o happy as to &s;ee Hecla vomit fire. But there were &s;ufficient traces of its burning inwardly: for, on the upper half of it, covered over with &s;now four or five inches deep, we frequently ob&s;erved &s;pots without any &s;now; and on the highe&s;t point where Farenheit's thermometer was at 24&deg; in the air, it ro&s;e to 153&deg; when it was &s;et down on the ground; and in &s;ome little holes it was &s;o hot, that we could no longer ob&s;erve the heat with a &s;mall pocket thermometer. It is not known whether, &s;ince the year 1693, Hecla has been burning till 1766, when it began to vomit flames on the 1&s;t of April, burnt for a long while, and de&s;troyed the country many miles round. In December, 1771, &s;ome flames likewi&s;e proceeded from it; and the people in the neighbourhood believe it will begin to burn again very &s;oon, as they pretend to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ob&s;erved, that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> thereabouts are drying up. It
<PB N="11" REF="031692_0011_0FEE0C8BFA054198">
is believed that this proceeds from the mountain's at|tracting the water, and is con&s;idered as a certain &s;ign of an impending eruption.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II. OF THE WARM BATHS, AND HOT SPOUTING SPRINGS OF WATER IN ICELAND.</HEAD>
<P>THESE waters have different degrees of warmth, and are, on that account, divided by the inhabitants them&s;elves into warm baths, and &s;prings that throw up the water to a con&s;iderable heighth. The fir&s;t are found in &s;everal other parts of Europe, though I do not believe that they are employed to the &s;ame purpo&s;es in any other place; that is to &s;ay, the inhabitants do not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in them here merely for their health, but they are likewi&s;e the occa&s;ion for a &s;cene of gallantry. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> poverty prevents the lover from making pre&s;ents to his fair one, and nature pre&s;ents no flowers of which garlands el&s;ewhere are made. It is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">, that in&s;tead of all this, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> one of the&s;e baths, which is afterwards to be honoured with the vi&s;its of his bride.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="031692_0012_0FEF2923ACB505C8">
The &s;prings that throw up water in the air de&s;erve more attention. I have &s;een a great number of them, but will only &s;ay &s;omething of the two mo&s;t remarka|ble. Near Laugervatan, a &s;mall lake of about a mile in circumference, which is two days journey di&s;tant from Hecla, I &s;aw the fir&s;t hot &s;pouting &s;pring; and I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that it was one of the mo&s;t beautiful &s;ights I ever beheld. The morning was uncommonly clear, and the &s;un had already began to gild the tops of the neighbouring mountains. It was &s;o perfect a calm, that the lake, on which &s;wans were &s;wimming, was as &s;mooth as a looking-gla&s;s, and round about it aro&s;e, in eight different places, the &s;team of the hot &s;prings, which lo&s;t it&s;elf high in the air.</P>
<P>Water was &s;pouting from all the&s;e &s;prings; but one, in particular, continually threw up in the air a column from 18 to 24 feet high, and from 6 to 8 feet diameter. The water was extremely hot. A piece of mutton, and &s;ome &s;almon trouts, as al&s;o a ptarmigan, were almo&s;t boiled to pieces in &s;ix minutes, and ta&s;ted excellently. I wi&s;h it were in my power to give &s;uch a de&s;cription of this place as it de&s;erves; but I fear it would always remain inferior in point of expre&s;&s;ion; &s;o much is cer|tain at lea&s;t, that nature never drew from any one a more cheerful ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to her great Creator, than I here paid him.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="031692_0013_0FEF283CCCED99D0">
The de&s;cription of the mo&s;t remarkable water &s;pout will appear almo&s;t incredible; but every part of it is perfectly true, for I would not aver any thing but what I have &s;een my&s;elf. At Gy&s;er, not far from Skallhalt, one of the Epi&s;copal &s;ees in Icelands a mo&s;t extraordi|nary large &s;pouting fountain is to be &s;een, with which the celebrated water-works at Marley and St. Cloud, and at Ca&s;&s;el, and Herrenhau&s;en near Hanover, can hard|ly be compared. One &s;ees here, within the circumfer|ence of three Engli&s;h miles, forty or fifty boiling &s;prings together, which, I believe, all proceed from one and the &s;ame re&s;ervoir. In &s;ome, the water is per|fectly clear, in others thick and clayey; in &s;ome, where it pa&s;&s;es through a fine ochre, it is tinged red as &s;carlet; and in others, where it flows over a paler clay, it is white as milk.</P>
<P>The large&s;t &s;pring which is in the middle particu|larly engaged our attention the whole day that we &s;pent here, from 6 in the morning till 7 at night. The aperture through which the water aro&s;e, is nineteen feet in diameter; round the top of it is a ba&s;on, which, together with the pipe, has the form of a cauldron. The margin of the ba&s;on is upwards of nine feet highet than the conduit, and its diameter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> feet. Here the water does not &s;pout continually, but only by intervals &s;everal times a day; and as I was inform|ed
<PB N="14" REF="031692_0014_0FEF283E53156428">
by the people in the neighbourhood, in wet weath|er higher than at other times.</P>
<P>One day that we were there, the water &s;pouted ten different times, between the hours of &s;ix and eleven in the morning, each time to the heighth of eight or ten fathoms. Till then the water had not ri&s;en above the margin of the pipe; but now it began by degrees to fill the upper ba&s;on, and at la&s;t to run over. The people who were with us, gave us to under&s;tand, that the wa|ter would &s;oon &s;pout up much higher than it had done till then, and this appeared very credible to us. To determine its heighth, therefore, with the utmo&s;t accu|racy, Dr. Lind, who had accompanied us on this voy|age, in the capacity of an a&s;tronomer, &s;et up his qua|drant.</P>
<P>Soon after four o'clock, we ob&s;erved that the earth began to tremble in three different places, as well as the top of a mountain which was about three hundred fa|thoms di&s;tant from the mouth of the &s;pring. We al&s;o frequently heard a &s;ubterraneous noi&s;e, like the di&s;|charge of a cannon; and immediately after a column of water &s;pouted from the opening, which, at a great heighth, divided it&s;elf into &s;everal rays, and, according to the ob&s;ervations made with the quadrant, was 92 feet high. Our great &s;urpri&s;e at this uncommon force of the air and fire was increa&s;ed, when many &s;tones, which we had flung into the aperture, were thrown up again with the &s;pouting water. It is ea&s;y to conceive
<PB N="15" REF="031692_0015_0FEF28AD51139CD0">
with how much plea&s;ure we &s;pent the day here; and indeed, I am not &s;urpri&s;ed, that a people &s;o much in|clined to &s;uper&s;tition as the Icelanders are, imagine this to be the entrance of hell. The idea is very natural to uninformed minds.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III. OF THE MANNERS OF THE ICELANDERS.</HEAD>
<P>THE Icelanders are of a good hone&s;t di&s;po&s;ition; but they are, at the &s;ame time, &s;o &s;erious and &s;ullen, that I hardly remember to have &s;een any one of them laugh. They are by no means &s;o &s;trong as might be &s;uppo&s;ed, and much le&s;s hand&s;ome. Their chief a|mu&s;ement in their lei&s;ure hours, is to recount to one another the hi&s;tory of former times; &s;o that to this day you do not meet with an Icelander, who is not well acquainted with the hi&s;tory of his own country. They al&s;o play at cards.</P>
<P>Their hou&s;es are built of lava, thatched with turf, and &s;o &s;mall, that one can hardly find room to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in. They have no floors; and their windows, in&s;tead of gla&s;s are compo&s;ed of thin membranes of certain ani|mals.
<PB N="16" REF="031692_0016_0FEF28B0C0C39A38">
They make no u&s;e of chimnies, as they never light a fire except to dre&s;s their victuals, when they only lay the turf on the ground.

They likewi&s;e boil groats of a kind of mo&s;s, which has an agreeable ta&s;te. The principal occupation of the men is fi&s;hing, which they follow both winter and &s;ummer.

In the morning and evening they commonly eat curds mixed with new milk, and &s;ometimes with juni|per-berries; in &s;ome parts they al&s;o have pottage of rock-gra&s;s, dried and made into flour, which is very palatable, or curdled milk, boiled till it becomes of a red colour, or new milk, boiled a long while.</P>
<P>At dinner their food con&s;i&s;ts of dried fi&s;h, with plen|ty of &s;our butter. They al&s;o &s;ometimes eat fre&s;h fi&s;h, and, when po&s;&s;ible, a little bread and chee&s;e with them.

<P>On Sunday, and in harve&s;t-time, they have broth made of meat, which is often boiled in <HI>&s;yra,</HI> or ferment|ed whey in&s;tead of water; and in winter they eat hung or dried meat.</P>

<P>They &s;eldom make u&s;e of fre&s;h or &s;alt butter, but let it grow &s;our before they eat it.

This is the u&s;ual manner of life in Iceland. In all countries the living of the poor differs e&s;&s;entially from that of the rich; and if an Iceland gentleman can af|ford to eat meat, butter, &s;hark, and whale, the pea&s;ants are obliged to content them&s;elves with fi&s;h, blands, or milk mixed with water, and milk pottage of rock-gra&s;s. Though the Icelanders cannot be &s;aid to be in want of nece&s;&s;ary aliment, yet the country has &s;everal times been vi&s;ited by great famines. The&s;e, however, have been chiefly owing to the Greenland floating ice, which, when it comes in great quantities, prevents the gra&s;s from growing, and puts an entire &s;top to their fi&s;hing.</P>

<P>The trade winds, from We&s;t and North, by pu&s;hing the clouds of Europe on Aby&s;&s;inia, blow in the direction of the Nile, in which mechani&s;m of nature it mu&s;t be remarked, that the wind, by driving back the waters of the river, becomes the principal cau&s;e of its ovarflow|ing. Having reached its highe&s;t degree towards the middle of September, the winds then becoming trade-winds from the &s;outhward, concur with the natural de&s;|cent of the Nile, to accelerate the draining of the water, to the &s;ame time that they collect the &s;uperfluous clouds, now of no further u&s;e, over Aby&s;&s;inia and Ethiopia, and carry them, for the &s;ame beneficial purpo&s;e of a periodical inundation, towards the &s;ources of the Eu|phrates, to enrich Me&s;opotamia, after abundantly wa|tering Egypt.

All the de&s;criptions of Egypt hitherto, agree in con|&s;idering the mud, with which the waters of the Nile an loaded during its increa&s;e, and which are left on the lands they overflow, as a fattener which fertilizes the country.

This method, which co&s;ts the hu&s;bandman but little labour, is made u&s;e of to pre&s;erve the Delta, when it is threatened by an inundation. This i&s;land, which pro|duces annually three crops, is con&s;tantly watered by machines built on the Nile, and on the canals which in|ter&s;ect it, but it is very &s;eldom in danger of being drow|ned; and this rich part of Egypt, which is clo&s;e to the &s;ea, would feel the effects of the &s;welling &s;till le&s;s, did not the trade-winds accumulate the waters of the Med|iterranean towards the &s;outh.</P>
<P>It is important to ob&s;erve, that the Delta, higher than the re&s;t of Egypt, is bordered, towards the &s;ea, by a for|e&s;t of palm-trees, called the fore&s;t of Beleros, the ground of which is far above the highe&s;t elevation of the waters, a topographical remark of it&s;elf, &s;ufficient to overthrow the formation of the Delta by a &s;ediment. Land, which is higher than the greate&s;t inundations, can never owe its origin to them. It can only have occa&s;ioned the divi|&s;ion of the Nile into two branches. But neither this cir|cum&s;tance, nor the exi&s;tence of the i&s;land, which &s;epar|ates them, required &s;o much labour; and Mr. Maillet might in this re&s;pect, have &s;pared him&s;elf the repetition of the &s;y&s;tem of Ephorus, which was not held in e&s;ti|mation, even by his cotemporaries.</P>
<P>The ve&s;tiges of the canals, which watered the ea&s;tern and we&s;tern provinces of the Delta, prove that it was formerly the &s;eat of the riche&s;t cultivation in Egypt.

<P>ONE can &s;carcely believe the influence which men of letters have in the gay and di&s;&s;ipated city of Paris.

<P>Politene&s;s and good manners, indeed may be traced, though in different proportions, through every rank, from the greate&s;t of the nobility to the lowe&s;t mechan|ic.

The mo&s;t incon&s;iderable circum&s;tance, which relates to the monarch, is of importance.

<P>If he happens to be a little indi&s;po&s;ed, all Paris, all France, is alarmed, as if a real calamity was threaten|ed; and to &s;eem intere&s;ted, or to conver&s;e upon any o|ther &s;ubject, till this has been di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, would be con&s;id|ered as a proof of unpardonable indifference.</P>

to their &s;ubjects for mal-admini&s;tration, or for continu|ed acts of inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion, is a doctrine very oppo&s;ite to the general prejudices of this nation.

They never would think of going fur|ther, I imagine, than placing another prince of the Bourbon family on the throne, with the &s;ame power that his predece&s;&s;or had, and then quietly lay down their arms, &s;atisfied with his royal word or declaration, to govern with more equity.</P>
<P>The French &s;eem &s;o delighted and dazzled with the lu&s;tre of monarchy, that they cannot bear the thoughts of any qualifying mixture, which might abate its vio|lence, and render its ardor more benign.

<HEAD>SECT. VIII. OF THE COMPLIMENTAL PHRASES USED BY THE FRENCH.</HEAD>
<P>THE French have often been accu&s;ed of in&s;incerity, and of being warm in profe&s;&s;ions, but devoid of real friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Our countrymen in particular are led into this opin|ion, from the manners in general being more ob&s;equi|ous here than in England. What Frenchmen con&s;ider as common good manners, many Engli&s;hmen would call flattery, perhaps fawning.</P>
<P>Their language abounds in complimental phra&s;es, which they di&s;tribute with wonderful profu&s;ion and vo|lubility; but they intend no more by them, than an Engli&s;hmen means when he &s;ub&s;cribes him&s;elf your mo&s;t obedient humble &s;ervant, at the conclu&s;ion of a letter.</P>
<P>A Frenchman not only means nothing beyond com|mon civility, by the plentiful &s;hower of compliments which he pours on every &s;tranger; but al&s;o, he takes it for granted, that the &s;tranger knows that nothing more is meant. The&s;e expre&s;&s;ions are fully under&s;tood by his countrymen; he imagines all the world are as well informed; and he has not the &s;malle&s;t intention to de|ceive. But if any man takes the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions in a lite|ral &s;en&s;e, and believes that people are in reality in&s;pir|ed with friend&s;hip, or have fallen in love with him at fir&s;t &s;ight, he will be very much di&s;appointed; e&s;pecial|ly if he expects &s;trong proofs of either.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="031692_0037_0FEF290E3854FD70">
Yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> has no right to accu&s;e the French of in&s;ince|rity, or breach of friend&s;hip. Friend&s;hip is entirely out of the que&s;tion. They never intended to convey any other idea, than that they were willing to receive him on the footing of an acquaintance; and it was the bu&s;ine&s;s of his language-ma&s;ter to have informed him of the real import of their expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>If the &s;ame words, indeed, were literally tran&s;lated into Engli&s;h, and u&s;ed by one Engli&s;hman to another, the per&s;on to whom they were addre&s;&s;ed, would have good rea&s;on to imagine, that the other had a particular regard for him, or meant to deceive him; becau&s;e the e&s;tabli&s;hed modes of civility and politene&s;s in England do not require &s;uch language.</P>
<P>The not making a proper allowance for different modes and u&s;ages, which accident has e&s;tabli&s;hed, is one great cau&s;e of the unfavourable and har&s;h &s;enti|ments, which the people of the different countries of the world too often harbour again&s;t each other.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid, perhaps, that this &s;uperfluity of com|pliments, which the French make u&s;e of, is a proof of the matter in que&s;tion, that the French have le&s;s &s;ince|rity than their neighbours. By the &s;ame rule we mu&s;t conclude, that the common people of every nation, who u&s;e few complimental phra&s;es in their di&s;cour&s;e, have a greater regard to truth, and &s;tronger &s;entiments of friend&s;hip, than tho&s;e in the middle and higher
<PB N="38" REF="031692_0038_0FEF2915492BA418">
ranks. But this is what I imagine it would be difficult to prove.</P>
<P>The&s;e complimental phra&s;es, which have crept into all modern languages, may, perhaps, be &s;uperfluous: or, if you plea&s;e, ab&s;urd. But they are &s;o fully e&s;tab|li&s;hed, that people of the greate&s;t integrity make u&s;e of them, both in England and in France, with this differ|ence, that a &s;maller proportion will do in the language of the one country than in that of the other. They are, however, indications of friend&s;hip in neither.</P>
<P>Friend&s;hip is a plant of &s;low growth in every climate. Happy the man who can rear a few, even where he has the mo&s;t &s;ettled re&s;idence. Travellers, pa&s;&s;ing through foreign countries, &s;eldom take time to culti|vate them. If they be pre&s;ented with &s;ome flowers, although of a flim&s;ey texture and quicker growth, they ought to accept of them with thankfulne&s;s, and not quarrel with the natives for choo&s;ing to retain the oth|er more valuable plant for their own u&s;e.</P>
<P>Of all travellers, the young Engli&s;h nobility and gen|try have the lea&s;t right to find fault with their enter|tainment while on their tours abroad; for &s;uch of them as &s;how a de&s;ire of forming a connection with the inhabitants, by even a moderate degree of atten|tion, are received upon ea&s;ier terms than the travellers from any other country; but very con&s;iderable num|bers of our countrymen have not the &s;malle&s;t de&s;ire of
<PB N="39" REF="031692_0039_0FEF2916CFE9B718">
that nature. They &s;eem rather to avoid their &s;ociety and accept with reluctance every offer of ho&s;pitality. This happens, partly from a prejudice again&s;t for|eigners of every kind, partly from timidity or natural re&s;erve, and in a great mea&s;ure from indolence, and an ab&s;olute dete&s;tation of ceremony and re&s;traint. Be|&s;ides, they hate to be obliged to &s;peak a language, of which they &s;eldom acquire a perfect command.</P>
<P>They frequently, therefore, form &s;ocieties or clubs of their own, where all ceremony is di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and the greate&s;t ea&s;e and latitude allowed in their behaviour, dre&s;s, and conver&s;ation. There they confirm each o|ther in all their prejudice, and with united voices, con|demn and ridicule the cu&s;toms and manners of every country but their own.</P>
<P>By this conduct, the true purpo&s;e of travelling is lo&s;t or perverted; and many Engli&s;h travellers have remained four or five years abroad, and have &s;eldom, during all this &s;pace, been in any company but that of their own countrymen.</P>
<P>To go to France and Italy, and there conver&s;e with none but Engli&s;h people, and merely that you may have it to &s;ay, that you have been in tho&s;e countries, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> certainly ab&s;urd. Nothing can be more &s;o, except to adopt with enthu&s;ia&s;m, the fa&s;hions, fopperies, ta&s;te, and manners of tho&s;e countries, and tran&s;plant them to England, where they never will thrive, and where
<PB N="40" REF="031692_0040_0FEF2922277BB250">
they always appear aukward and unnatural. For, af|ter all his efforts of imitation, a travelled Engli&s;hman is as different from a Frenchman or an Italian, as an Engli&s;h ma&s;tiff is from a monkey or a fox. And if e|ver that &s;edate and plain meaning dog &s;hould pretend to the gay fri&s;kine&s;s of the one, or to the &s;ubtilty of the other, we &s;hould certainly value him much le&s;s than we do.</P>
<P>But I do not imagine that this extreme is by any means &s;o common as the former. It is much more natural to the Engli&s;h character to de&s;pi&s;e foreigners than to imitate them. A few tawdry examples to the contrary, who return every winter from the conti|nent, are hardly worth mentioning as exceptions.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. IX, OF GENEVA.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ituation of Geneva is, in many re&s;pects as happy as the heart of man could de&s;ire, or his imagina|tion conceive. The Rhone, ru&s;hing out of the no|ble&s;t lake in Europe, flows through the middle of the
<PB N="41" REF="031692_0041_0FEF2827EEA475D0">
city, which is encircled by fertile fields, cultivated by the indu&s;try, and adorned by the riches and ta&s;te of the inhabitants.</P>

<P>With the&s;e advantages in point of &s;ituation, the citi|zens of Geneva enjoy freedom untainted by licentiou&s;|ne&s;s, and &s;ecurity unbought by the horrors of war.</P>
<P>The great number of men of letters, who either are natives of the place, or have cho&s;en it for their re&s;i|dence, the decent manners, the ea&s;y circum&s;tances, and humane di&s;po&s;itions of the Genevois in general, render this city and its environs a very de&s;irable retreat for people of a philo&s;ophic turn of mind, who are content|ed with moderate and calm enjoyments, have no local attachments or dome&s;tic rea&s;ons for preferring another country, and who wi&s;h, in a certain degree, to retire from the bu&s;tle of the world, to a narrower and calmer &s;cene, and there for the re&s;t of their days&mdash;

<P>As education <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> is equally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and liberal, the citizens of Geneva of both &s;exes are remarkably well in&s;tructed. I do not imagine that any country in the world can produce an equal number of per&s;ons, (taken
<PB N="42" REF="031692_0042_0FEF29252F8C2E20">
without election from all degrees and profe&s;&s;ions) with minds &s;o much cultivated as the inhabitants of Geneva po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>It is not uncommon to find mechanics, in the inter|vals of their labour, amu&s;ing them&s;elves with the works of Locke, Monte&s;quieu, Newton, and other productions of the &s;ame kind.</P>
<P>When I &s;peak of the cheapne&s;s of a liberal education, I mean for the natives and citizens only; for &s;trangers now find every thing dear at Geneva. Wherever En|gli&s;hmen re&s;ort, this is the ca&s;e. If they do not find things dear, they &s;oon make them &s;o.</P>
<P>The democratical nature of their government in|&s;pires every citizen with an idea of his own impor|tance. He perceives, that no man in the republic can in&s;ult, or even neglect him with impunity.</P>
<P>It is an excellent circum&s;tance in any government, when the mo&s;t powerful man in the &s;tate has &s;omething to fear from the mo&s;t feeble. This is the ca&s;e here. The meane&s;t citizen of Geneva is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of certain rights, which render him an object de&s;erving the atten|tion of the greate&s;t. Be&s;ides, a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of this makes him re&s;pect him&s;elf; a &s;entiment which, with|in proper bounds, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> tendency <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> render a man re&s;|pectable to others.</P>
<P>The general character of human nature forbids us to expect that men will always act from motives of pub|lic

&s;pirit, without an eye to private intere&s;t. The be&s;t form of government, therefore, is, that in which the intere&s;t of individuals is mo&s;t intimately blended with the public good. This may be more perfectly ac|compli&s;hed in a &s;mall republic than in a great mon|archy. In the fir&s;t, men of genius and virtue are di&s;|covered and called to offices of truth, by the impar|tial admiration of their fellow citizens; in the other, the highe&s;t places are di&s;po&s;ed of by the caprice of the prince, or of tho&s;e courtiers, male or female, who are neare&s;t his per&s;on, watch the variations of his humour, and know how to &s;eize the &s;miling moments, and turn them to their own advantage, or that of their depend|ents. Monte&s;quieu &s;ays, that a &s;en&s;e of honour pro|duces the &s;ame effects in a monarchy, that public &s;pirit or patrioti&s;m does in a republic. It mu&s;t be remem|bered, however, that the fir&s;t, according to the modern acceptation of the word, is generally confined to the no|bility and gentry; whereas public &s;pirit is a more u|niver&s;al principle, and &s;preads through all the mem|bers of the commonwealth.</P>
<P>As far as I can judge, a &s;pirit of independency and freedom, tempered by &s;entiments of decency, and the love of order, influence, in a mo&s;t remarkable manner, the minds of the &s;ubjects of this happy republic.</P>
<P>Before I knew them I had formed an opinion, that the people of this place were fanatical, gloomy mind|ed,
<PB N="44" REF="031692_0044_0FEF2933D65A2718">
and un&s;ociable as the Puritans in England, and the Pre&s;byterians in Scotland were, during the civil wars, and the reigns of Charles II. and his bro|ther. In this however, I find I had conceived a very erroneous notion.</P>
<P>There is not, I may venture to a&s;&s;ert, a city in Eu|rope, where the minds of the people are le&s;s under the influence of &s;uper&s;tition or fanatical enthu&s;ia&s;m than at Geneva. Servetus, were he now alive, would not run the &s;malle&s;t ri&s;k of per&s;ecution. The pre&s;ent clergy have, I am per&s;uaded, as little the inclination as the power of mole&s;ting any per&s;on of &s;peculative o|pinions. Should the Pope him&s;elf chu&s;e this city for a retreat, it would be his own fault if he did not live in as much &s;ecurity as at the Vatican.</P>
<P>The clergy of Geneva in general, are men of &s;en&s;e, learning, and moderation, impre&s;&s;ing upon the minds of their hearers the tenets of Chri&s;tianity, with all the graces of pulpit eloquence, and illu&s;trating the effica|cy of the doctrine by their conduct in life.</P>
<P>The people of every &s;tation in this place, attend &s;ermons and the public wor&s;hip with remarkable punctuality. The Sunday is honoured with the mo&s;t re&s;pectful decorum during the hours of divine &s;ervice; but as &s;oon as that is over, all the u&s;ual amu&s;ements commence.</P>
<P>The public walks are crouded by all degrees of
<PB N="45" REF="031692_0045_0FEF29355D49CD80">
people in their be&s;t dre&s;&s;es. The different &s;ocieties, and what they call circles, a&s;&s;emble in the hou&s;es and gardens of individuals. They play at cards and at bowls, and have parties upon the lake with mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>There is one cu&s;tom univer&s;al here, and, as far as I know, peculiar to this place. The parents form &s;oci|eties for their children, at a very early period of their lives. The&s;e &s;ocieties con&s;i&s;t of ten, a dozen or more children of the &s;ame &s;ex, and nearly of the &s;ame age and &s;ituation in life. They a&s;&s;emble once a week in the hou&s;es of the different parents, who entertain the company by turns with tea, coffee, bi&s;cuits, and fruit, and then leave the young a&s;&s;embly to the freedom of their own conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>This connection is &s;trictly kept up through life, whatever alterations may take place in the &s;ituations or circum&s;tances of the individuals. And although they &s;hould afterwards form new or preferable intima|cies, they never entirely abandon this &s;ociety; but to the late&s;t period of their lives continue to pa&s;s a few e|venings every year with the companions of their youth and their earlie&s;t friends.</P>
<P>The richer cla&s;s of the citizens have country hou&s;es adjacent to the town, where they pa&s;s one half of the year. The&s;e hou&s;es are all very neat, and &s;ome of them are &s;plendid. One piece of magnificence they po&s;&s;e&s;s in greater perfection than the mo&s;t &s;uperb villa of the

greate&s;t lord in any other part of the world can boa&s;t; I mean the pro&s;pect which almo&s;t all of them command. The gardens and vineyards of the republic, the Pais de Naux, Geneva with its lake, innumerable country|&s;eats, ca&s;tles, and little towns around the lake; the vallies of Savoy, and the loftie&s;t mountains of the Alps, are all within one &s;weep of the eye.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who&s;e fortunes or employments do not permit them to pa&s;s the &s;ummer in the country, make fre|quent parties of plea&s;ure upon the lake, and dine and &s;pend the evening at &s;ome of the villages in the envi|rons, where they amu&s;e them&s;elves with mu&s;ic and dancing.</P>
<P>Sometimes they form them&s;elves into circles, con|&s;i&s;ting of forty or fifty per&s;ons, and purcha&s;e or hire a hou&s;e and garden near the town, where they a&s;&s;emble every afternoon during the &s;ummer, drink coffee, lem|onade, and other refre&s;hing liquors, and amu&s;e them|&s;elves with cards, conver&s;ation, and playing at bowls, a game very different from that which goes by the &s;ame name in England; for here, in&s;tead of a &s;mooth level green, they often chu&s;e the roughe&s;t and mo&s;t un|equal piece of ground.

<HEAD>SECT. X. OF THE GLACIERS OF SAVOY.</HEAD>
<P>I RETURNED to Geneva, a few days &s;ince, from a journey to the Glaciers of Savoy, the Pais de Val|lais, and other places among the Alps.</P>
<P>The wonderful accounts I had heard of the Gla|ciers had excited my curio&s;ity a good deal, while the air of &s;uperiority a&s;&s;umed by &s;ome who had made this boa&s;ted tour, piquid my pride &s;till more.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="031692_0048_0FEF29480E4EB840">
One could hardly mention any thing curious or &s;in|gular, without being told by &s;ome of tho&s;e travellers, with an air of cool contempt&mdash;"Dear Sir&mdash;that is pretty well; but take my word for it, it is nothing to the Glaciers of Savoy."</P>
<P>I determined at la&s;t not to take their word for it, and I found &s;ome gentlemen of the &s;ame way of thinking.</P>
<P>We left Geneva early in the morning of the 3d of Augu&s;t, and breakfa&s;ted at Bonneville, a &s;mall town in the duchy of Savoy, &s;ituated at the foot of Mole, and on the banks of the river Arve.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed the night at Sallenche, and the remain|ing part of our journey not admitting of chai&s;es, they were &s;ent back to Geneva, with orders to the drivers to go round by the other &s;ide of the lake, and meet us at the village of Martigny, in the Pais de Vallais.</P>
<P>We agreed with a muleteer at Sallenche, who pro|vided mules to carry us over the mountains to Mar|tigny. It is a good day's journey from Sallenche to Chamouni, not on account of the di&s;tance, but from the difficulty and perplexity of the road, and the &s;teep a&s;cents and de&s;cents with which one is teazed alternate|ly the whole way.</P>
<P>Some of the mountains are covered with pine, oak, beech, and walnut-trees. The&s;e are inter&s;per&s;ed with apple, plumb, cherry, and other fruit-trees, &s;o that we rode a great part of the morning in &s;hade.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="031692_0049_0FEE0C71D24B1EE8">
Be&s;ides the refre&s;hing coolne&s;s which this occa&s;ion|ed, it was mo&s;t agreeable to me on another account. The road was in &s;ome places &s;o exceedingly &s;teep, that I never doubted but &s;ome of us were to fall; I there|fore reflected with &s;atisfaction, that tho&s;e trees would probably arre&s;t our cour&s;e, and hinder us from rolling a great way.</P>
<P>But many pathle&s;s craggy mountains remained to be traver&s;ed, after we had lo&s;t the protection of the trees. We then had nothing but the &s;agacity of our mules to tru&s;t to. For my own part, I was very &s;oon convinc|ed, that it was much &s;afer, on all dubious occa&s;ions, to depend on their's than on my own. For as often as I was pre&s;ented with a choice of difficulties, and the mule and I were of different opinions, if, becoming more ob&s;tinate than he, I in&s;i&s;ted on his taking my track, I never failed to repent it, and often was obliged to return to the place where the controver&s;y had be|gun, and follow the path to which he had pointed at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>It is entertaining to ob&s;erve the prudence of the&s;e animals in making their way down &s;uch dangerous rocks. They &s;ometimes put their heads over the edge of the precipice, and examine with anxious cir|cum&s;pection, every po&s;&s;ible way by which they can de&s;cend, and at length are &s;ure to fix on that, which upon the whole is the be&s;t. Having ob&s;erved this in
<PB N="50" REF="031692_0050_0FEE0D1D1206A3A8">
&s;everal in&s;tances, I laid the bridle on the neck of my mule, and allowed him to take his own way, without pre&s;uming to controul him in the &s;malle&s;t degree.</P>
<P>This is doubtle&s;s the be&s;t method, and what I re|commend to all my friends in their journey through life, when they have mules for their companions.</P>
<P>We began pretty early next morning to a&s;cend Mon|tanvert, from the top of which there is ea&s;y acce&s;s to the Glaciers of that name, and to the valley of ice.</P>
<P>Having a&s;cended Montanvert from Chamouni, on de&s;cending a little on the other &s;ide, we found our|&s;elves on a plain, who&s;e appearance has been aptly compared to that which a &s;tormy &s;ea would have, if it were &s;uddenly arre&s;ted, and fixed by a &s;trong fro&s;t. This is called the Valley of Ice. It &s;tretches &s;everal leagues behind Montanvert, and is reckoned 2300 feet higher than the valley of Chamouni.</P>
<P>From the highe&s;t part of Montanvert, we had all the following objects under our eye, &s;ome of which &s;eem|ed to ob&s;truct the view of others equally intere&s;ting;&mdash;the Valley of Ice, the Needles, Mont Blanc, with the &s;nowy mountains below, finely contra&s;ted with Breven, and the green hills on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of Cha|mouni, and the &s;un in full &s;plendor &s;howing all of them to the greate&s;t advantage. The whole forms a &s;cene equally &s;ublime and beautiful, far from my pow|er of de&s;cription, and worthy of the eloquence of that

very ingenious gentleman, who has &s;o finely illu&s;trated the&s;e &s;ubjects, in a particilar treati&s;e, and given &s;o many examples of both in his parliamentary &s;peeches.</P>
<P>The Valley of Ice is &s;everal leagues in length, and not above a quarter of a league in breadth. It divides into branches, which run behind the chain of moun|tains formerly taken notice of. It appears like a fro|zen amphitheatre, and is bounded by mountains, in who&s;e clefts columns of cry&s;tal, as we are informed, are to be found.</P>
<P>The hoary maje&s;ty of Mont Blanc&mdash;I was in danger of ri&s;ing into poetry, when recollecting the &s;tory of Icarus, I thought it be&s;t not to tru&s;t to my own waxen wings. I beg leave rather to borrow the following lines, which will plea&s;e better than any flight of mine, and prevent me from a fall.</P>
<LG>
<L>" So Zembla's rock (the beauteous work of fro&s;t)</L>
<L>" Ri&s;e white in air, and glitter o'er the coa&s;t,</L>

<L>" Fill the bright mountains, prop th' incumbent &s;ky;</L>
<L>" As Atlas fix'd, each hoary pile appears,</L>
<L>" The gather'd winter of a thou&s;and years."</L>
</LG>
<P>There are five or &s;ix different Glaciers, which all terminate upon one &s;ide of the Valley of Chamouni, within the &s;pace of about five leagues.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="031692_0052_0FEE0D2028B0DAD8">
The&s;e are prodigious collections of &s;now and ice, formed in the intervals of hollows between the moun|tains that bound the &s;ide of the Valley, near which Mont Blanc &s;tands.</P>
<P>The &s;now in tho&s;e hollows being &s;creened from the influence of the &s;un, the heat of &s;ummer can di&s;&s;olve only a certain portion of it. The&s;e magazines of ice and &s;now are not formed by what falls directly from the heavens into the intervals. They are &s;upplied by the &s;now which falls during winter on the loftie&s;t parts of Mont Blanc; large beds of &s;trata of which &s;lide down imperceptibly by their own gravity, and finding no re&s;i&s;tance at the&s;e intervals, they form long irregular roots around all the adjacent mountains.</P>
<P>Five of the&s;e enter, by five different embouchures, into the valley of Chamouni, and are called Glaciers, on one of which we were. At pre&s;ent their &s;urface is from a thou&s;and, or two thou&s;and feet high above the valley.</P>
<P>Their breadth depends on the widene&s;s of the inter|val between the mountains in which they are formed. Viewed from the valley, they have, in my opinion, a much finer effect than from their &s;ummit.</P>
<P>The rays of the &s;un &s;triking with various force on the different parts, according as they are more or le&s;s expo&s;ed, occa&s;ion an unequal di&s;&s;olution of the ice; and, with the help of a little imagination, give the ap|pearance
<PB N="53" REF="031692_0053_0FEE0D2743131430">
of columns, arches, and turrets, which are in &s;ome places tran&s;parent.</P>
<P>A fabric of ice in this ta&s;te, two thou&s;and feet high, and three times as broad, with the &s;un &s;hining full upon it, we mu&s;t acknowledge to be a very &s;ingular piece of architecture.</P>
<P>Our company a&s;cended only the Glacier of Mon|tanvert, which is not the highe&s;t, and were contented with a view of the others from the valley; but more curious travellers will &s;urely think it worth their la|bour to examine each of them more particularly.</P>
<P>Some people are &s;o fond of Glaciers, that not &s;atis|fied with their pre&s;ent &s;ize, they in&s;i&s;t po&s;itively, that they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily grow larger every year, and they argue the matter thus:</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent exi&s;tence of the Glaciers, is a &s;ufficient proof, that there has, at &s;ome period or other, been a greater quantity of &s;now formed during the winter, than the heat of the &s;ummer has been able to di&s;&s;olve. But this di&s;proportion mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily increa&s;e every year, and, by con&s;equence, the Glaciers mu&s;t augment: becau&s;e, any given quantity of &s;now and ice remain|ing through the cour&s;e of one &s;ummer, mu&s;t increa&s;e the cold of the atmo&s;phere around it in &s;on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> degree; which being reinforced by the &s;now of the &s;ucceeding winter, will re&s;i&s;t the di&s;&s;olving power of the &s;un more
<PB N="54" REF="031692_0054_0FEE0D28CE505A38">
the &s;econd &s;ummer than the fir&s;t, and &s;till more the third than the &s;econd, and &s;o on.</P>
<P>The conclu&s;ion of this rea&s;oning is, that the Gla|ciers mu&s;t grow larger by an increa&s;ing ratio every year, till the end of time. For this rea&s;on, the au|thors of this theory regret, that they them&s;elves have been &s;ent into the world &s;o &s;oon; becau&s;e if their birth had been delayed for nine or ten thou&s;and years, they &s;hould have &s;een the Glaciers in much greater glory, Mont Blanc being but a Lilliputian at pre&s;ent, in compa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;on of what it will be then.</P>
<P>However rational this may appear, objections <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ave neverthele&s;s been &s;ugge&s;ted, which I am &s;orry for; be|cau&s;e when a theory is tolerably con&s;i&s;tent, well fabri|cated and goodly to behold, nothing can be more vex|atious, than to &s;ee a plodding officious fellow over|throw the whole &s;tructure at once, by a da&s;h of his pen, as Harlequin does a hou&s;e with a touch of his &s;word, in a pantomine entertainment.</P>
<P>Such cavillers &s;ay, that as the Glaciers augment in &s;ize, there mu&s;t be a greater extent of &s;urface for the &s;un-beams to act upon, and, by con&s;equence, the di&s;|&s;olution will be greater, which mu&s;t effectually pre|vent the continual increa&s;e contended for.</P>
<P>But the other party extricate them&s;elves from this difficulty by roundly a&s;&s;erting, that the additional cold, occa&s;ioned by the &s;now and ice already depo&s;ited, has
<PB N="55" REF="031692_0055_0FEE0D2E03218F38">
a much greater influence in retarding their di&s;&s;olution, than the increa&s;ed &s;urface can have in ha&s;tening it; and, in confirmation of their &s;y&s;tem, they tell you, that the olde&s;t inhabitants of Chamouni remember the Glaciers when they were much &s;maller than at pre&s;ent; and al&s;o remember the time, when they could walk from the Valley of Ice, to places behind the moun|tains, by pa&s;&s;ages which are now quite choaked up with hills of &s;now, not above fifty years old.</P>
<P>Whether the inhabitants of Chamouni a&s;&s;ert this from a laudable partiality to the Glaciers, which they may now con&s;ider (on account of their drawing &s;tran|gers to vi&s;it the Valley) as their be&s;t neighbours; or from politene&s;s to the &s;upporters of the above men|tioned opinion; or from real ob&s;ervation, I &s;hall not pre&s;ume to &s;ay. But I my&s;elf have heard &s;everal of the old people of Chamouni a&s;&s;ert the fact.</P>
<P>The cavillers, being thus obliged to relinqui&s;h their former objection, attempt in the next place to &s;how, that the above theory leads to an ab&s;urdity; becau&s;e, &s;ay they, if their Glaciers go on increa&s;ing the bulk <HI>ad infinitum,</HI> the globe it&s;elf would become, in proce&s;s of time, a mere appendage to Mont Blanc.</P>
<P>The advocates for the continual augmentation of the Glaciers reply, that as this inconveniency has not already happened, there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">needs no other refutation of the impious doctrine of certain philo&s;ophers, who a&s;&s;ert
<PB N="56" REF="031692_0056_0FEE0D2F8E55E048">
that the world has exi&s;ted from eternity; and as to the globe's becoming an appendage to the mountain, they a&s;&s;ure us, that the world will be at an end long before that event can happen; &s;o that tho&s;e of the mo&s;t timid na|tures, and mo&s;t delicate con&s;titutions, may di&s;mi&s;s their fears on that &s;ubject.</P>
<P>For my own part, though I wi&s;h well to the Gla|ciers, and all the inhabitants of Chamouni, having pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome days very plea&s;antly in their company, I will take no part in this controver&s;y.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XI. OF VOLTAIRE.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE I arrived at Geneva, my corre&s;pondents have made many enquiries concerning the philo&s;opher of Ferney, which I am not at all &s;urpri&s;ed at. This extraordinary per&s;on has contrived to excite more cu|rio&s;ity, and to retain the attention of Europe for a longer &s;pace of time than any other man this age has produced, monarchs and heroes included. Even the mo&s;t trivial anecdote relating to him &s;eems, in &s;ome degree, to intere&s;t the public.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="031692_0057_0FEE0D311ADD0B70">
I have had frequent opportunities of conver&s;ing with him, and &s;till more with tho&s;e who have lived in intimacy with him for many years; &s;o that the fol|lowing remarks are founded, either on my own ob&s;er|vation, or on that of the mo&s;t candid and intelligent of his acquaintance.</P>
<P>He has enemies and admirers here, as he has every where el&s;e; and not unfrequently both united in the &s;ame per&s;on.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t idea which has pre&s;ented it&s;elf to all who have attempted a de&s;cription of his per&s;on, is that of a &s;keleton. In as far as this implies exce&s;&s;ive leanne&s;s, it is ju&s;t; but it mu&s;t be remembered, that this &s;kele|ton, this mere compo&s;ition of &s;kin and bone, has a look of more &s;pirit and vivacity than is generally produced by fle&s;h and blood, however blooming and youthful.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t piercing eyes I ever beheld are tho&s;e of Voltaire, now in his eightieth year. His whole coun|tenance is expre&s;&s;ive of genius, ob&s;ervation, and ex|treme &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>In the morning he has a look of anxiety and di&s;con|tent; but this gradually wears off, and after dinner he &s;eems cheerful. An air of irony, however, never en|tirely for&s;akes his face, but may always be ob&s;erved lurking in his features, whether he frowns or &s;miles.</P>
<P>When the weather is favourable, he takes an airing in his coach, with his niece, or with &s;ome of his gue&s;ts,
<PB N="58" REF="031692_0058_0FEE0D3891139500">
of whom there is always a &s;ufficient number at Fer|ney. Sometimes he &s;aunters in his garden; or if the weather does not permit him to go abroad, he employs his lei&s;ure hours in playing at che&s;s with Pere Adam, or in receiving the vi&s;its of &s;trangers, a continual &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of whom attend at Ferney, to catch an oppor|tunity of &s;eeing him; or in dictating and reading let|ters: for he &s;till retains corre&s;pondents in all the countries of Europe, who inform him of every remark|able occurrence, and &s;end him every new literary pro|duction as &s;oon as it appears.</P>
<P>By far the greate&s;t part of his time is &s;pent in his &s;tu|dy; and whether he reads him&s;elf, or li&s;tens to anoth|er, he always has a pen in his hand, to take notes, or make remarks.</P>
<P>Compo&s;ition is his principal amu&s;ement. No au|thor, who writes for daily bread, no young poet, ar|dent for di&s;tinction, is more a&s;&s;iduous with his pen, or more anxious for fre&s;h fame, than the wealthy and ap|plauded Seigneur of Ferney.</P>
<P>He lives in a very ho&s;pitable manner, and takes care always to keep a good cook. He has generally two or three vi&s;itors from Paris, who &s;tay with him a month or &s;ix weeks at a time. When they go, their places are &s;oon &s;upplied; &s;o that there is a con&s;tant rotation of &s;ociety at Ferney. The&s;e, with Voltaire's own family, and his vi&s;itors from Geneva, compo&s;e a
<PB N="59" REF="031692_0059_0FEE0D3A1C5DCF70">
company of twelve or fourteen people, who dine daily at his table, whether he appears or not. For, when engaged in preparing &s;ome new production for the pre&s;s, indi&s;po&s;ed, or in bad &s;pirits, he does not dine with the company; but &s;atisfies him&s;elf with &s;eeing them for a few minutes, either before or after dinner.</P>
<P>All who bring recommendations from his friends, may depend upon being received if he be not really in|di&s;po&s;ed. He often pre&s;ents him&s;elf to the &s;trangers, who a&s;&s;emble almo&s;t every afternoon in his anti|chamber, although they bring no particular recommen|dation. But &s;ometimes they are obliged to retire, without having their curio&s;ity gratified.</P>
<P>As often as this happens, he is &s;ure of being accu&s;ed of peevi&s;hne&s;s; and a thou&s;and ill-natured &s;tories are related, perhaps, invented, out of revenge, becau&s;e he is not in the humour of being exhibited like a danc|ing bear on a holiday. It is much le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ing that he &s;ometimes refu&s;es, than that he &s;hould comply &s;o often. In him, this compliance mu&s;t proceed &s;olely from a de&s;ire to oblige; for Voltaire has been &s;o long accu&s;tomed to admiration, that the &s;tare of a few &s;tran|gers cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to afford him much plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>His niece, Madame Denis, does the honours of the table, and entertains the company, when her uncle is not able, or does not chu&s;e to appear. She is a well-di&s;po&s;ed woman, who behaves with good humour to
<PB N="60" REF="031692_0060_0FEE0D3BA84B6630">
every body, and with unremitting attention and ten|derne&s;s to her uncle.</P>
<P>The morning is not a proper time to vi&s;it Voltaire. He cannot bear to have his hours of &s;tudy interrupted. This alone is &s;ufficient to put him out of humour; be&s;ides, he is then apt to be querulous, whether he &s;uf|fers by the infirmities of age, or from &s;ome acccidental cau&s;e of chagrin. Whatever be the rea&s;on, he is le&s;s an optimi&s;t at that part of the day than at any other. It was in the morning probably that he remarked, "<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">That it was a pity that the Peruvian bark is found in Amer|ica and fevers in our climates.</NOTE> (que c'etoit domage que le quinquina &s;e trouvoit en Am&eacute;rique, et la fi&eacute;vre en nos climats.")</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are invited to &s;upper, have an opportuni|ty of &s;eeing him in the mo&s;t advantageous point of view. He then exerts him&s;elf to entertain the compa|ny, and &s;eems as fond of &s;aying, what are called good things, as ever. And when any lively remark, or bon mot, comes from another, he is equally delighted, and pays the fulle&s;t tribute of applau&s;e. The &s;pirit of mirth gains upon him by indulgence. When &s;ur|rounded by his friends, and animated by the pre&s;ence of women, he &s;eems to enjoy life with all the &s;en&s;ibili|ty of youth. His genius then &s;urmounts the re&s;traints of age and infirmity, and flows along in a fine &s;train of plea&s;ing, &s;pirited ob&s;ervation, and delicate irony.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="031692_0061_0FEE0D41D37C24D8">
He has an excellent talent of adapting his conver&s;a|tion to his company. The fir&s;t time the D&mdash;of H&mdash;waited on him, he turned the di&s;cour&s;e on the ancient alliance between the French and Scotch nations. Reciting the circum&s;tance of one of his Grace's predece&s;&s;ors having accompanied Mary Queen of Scots, who&s;e heir he at that time was, to the court of France, he &s;poke of the heroic characters of his an|ce&s;tors, the ancient Earls of Douglas, of the great liter|ary reputation of &s;ome of his countrymen then living; and mentioned the names of Hume and Robert&s;on in terms of high approbation.</P>
<P>A &s;hort time afterwards he was vi&s;ited by two Ru&s;|&s;ian noblemen, who are now at Geneva. Voltaire talk|ed to them a great deal of their Empre&s;s, and the flour|i&s;hing &s;tate of their country. Formerly, &s;aid he, your countrymen were guided by ignorant prie&s;ts, the arts were unknown, and your lands lay wa&s;te; but now the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ts flouri&s;h, and the lands are cultivated. One of the young men replied, that there was &s;till a great pro|portion of barren land in Ru&s;&s;ia. At lea&s;t, &s;aid Vol|taire, you mu&s;t admit, that of late your country has been "very fertile in laurels."</P>
<P>Voltaire has great merit as a dramatic writer; and it is much to be wi&s;hed, that this extraordinary man had confined his genius to its native home, to the walks which the mu&s;es love, and where he has always been
<PB N="62" REF="031692_0062_0FEE0D4720A41440">
received with di&s;tingui&s;hed honour, and that he had ne|ver deviated from the&s;e, into the thorny paths of con|trover&s;y. For, while he attacked the tyrants and op|pre&s;&s;ors of mankind, and tho&s;e who have perverted the benevolent nature of Chri&s;tianity to the mo&s;t &s;elf|i&s;h and malignant purpo&s;es, it is for ever to be regret|ted, that he allowed the &s;hafts of his ridicule to glance upon the Chri&s;tian religion it&s;elf.</P>
<P>By per&s;evering in this, he has not only &s;hocked the pious, but even di&s;gu&s;ted infidels, who accu&s;e him of borrowing from him&s;elf, and repeating the &s;ame argu|ment in various publications; and &s;eem as tired of the &s;tale &s;neer again&s;t the Chri&s;tian doctrines, as of the dulle&s;t and mo&s;t tedious &s;ermons in &s;upport of them.</P>

The cleanline&s;s of the hou&s;es, and of the people, is peculiarly &s;triking; and I can trace in all their manners, behaviour and dre&s;s, &s;ome &s;trong outlines which di&s;tingui&s;h this happy people from the neighbouring nations.

<P>Schaffhau&s;en is a neat and tolerably well-built town, &s;ituated upon the nothern &s;hore of the Rhine. It is the capital of the canton of the &s;ame name, and ows its ori|gin to the interruption of the navigation of that river by the cataract at Lauffen. Huts were at fir&s;t con|&s;tructed here for the convenience of unloading the merchandize from the boats; and the&s;e huts by de|grees, increa&s;ed to a large town. Schaffhau&s;en was formerly an imperial city, and was governed by a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> ari&s;tocracy. It pre&s;erved liberties, which were attack|ed by the Dukes of Au&s;tria, by entering into an alli|ance with &s;everal other imperial towns, and with the Swi&s;s cantons. In 1501, it was admitted a member of the Helvetic confederacy, being the twelfth canton in rank. Of all the cantons it is the lea&s;t in &s;ize, be|ing only five leagues in length, and three in breadth. Its population is &s;uppo&s;ed to amount to 30,000 &s;ouls; of which the capital contains about 6000.</P>

The whole number of citizens or burge&s;&s;es (in whom the &s;upreme power ultimatey re&s;ides) is, I am informed, about &s;ix hundred. They are divided into twelve tribes; and from the&s;e are elected eighty-five members, who form the &s;overeign council, con&s;i&s;ting of a great and little council. To the&s;e two councils combined, the admini&s;tration of affairs is committed; the &s;enate, or little council of twenty-five, being en|tru&s;ted with the executive power; and the great coun|cil, compri&s;ing the &s;enate, finally deciding all appeals and regulating the more important concerns of gov|vernment.</P>
<P>The revenues of the &s;tate ari&s;e partly from the tythes, and other articles of the like nature; but principally from the duties laid upon the merchandi&s;e which pa&s;&s;es from Germany; and I am informed, that the&s;e cu&s;|toms are nearly &s;ufficient to defray all the public ex|pences. The&s;e, indeed, are not very con&s;iderable, as will appear from the &s;alary of the burgo-ma&s;ter, or chief of the republic, which barely amounts to an hundred and fifty pounds per annum. The reform|ation was introduced here in 1529. The clergy are paid by the &s;tate, but their income is literally not &s;uf|ficient for their maintenance; the be&s;t living being on|ly about an hundred pounds, and the wor&s;t only forty pounds per annum. The profe&s;&s;ors of literature al&s;o, who are taken from the clergy, are paid likewi&s;e by

government; and a public &s;chool is &s;upported at the expence of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Sumptuary laws are in force here, as well as in mo&s;t parts of Swi&s;&s;erland; and no dancing is allowed, ex|cept upon particular occa&s;ions. Silk, lace, and &s;ever|al other articles of luxury are prohibited. Even the ladies head-dre&s;&s;es are regulated. How would &s;uch Gothic ordinances be received in England? They would &s;erve at lea&s;t to lower the price of feathers.</P>
<P>But what is of &s;till greater importance, all games of hazard are &s;trictly prohibited; and in other games, the party who lo&s;es above fix florins (about nine &s;hillings of our money) incurs a con&s;iderable fine. An excel|lent regulation! And I was informed, that the&s;e laws are not, like ours of the &s;ame kind, mere cyphers, but are well ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>The principal article of exportation is wine, of which they make a large quantity, the country abounding in vineyards. And as the canton furni&s;hes but little corn, they procure it from Suabia, in exchange of their wine. In the town there are &s;ome, but not very con|&s;iderable, manufactures, of linen, cotton, and &s;ilk. Their commerce, however, is very flouri&s;hing.</P>
<P>Scaffhau&s;en, although a frontier town, has no gar|ri&s;on; and the fortifications are but &s;light. Nothing can give a better idea of the &s;ecurity of the Swi&s;s can|tons; the citizens mount guard by turns; and the
<PB N="66" REF="031692_0066_0FEE0D53C794AC80">
people of the canton being divided into regular com|panies of militia, which are exerci&s;ed yearly, are al|ways ready and prepared to take up arms in defence of their country. This canton has &s;ome troops in the &s;ervice of France, Sardinia, and Holland; the only foreign &s;ervices into which the &s;ubjects of the Prote&s;t|ant cantons enli&s;t.</P>
<P>Before I take my leave of this city, I mu&s;t not omit mentioning the famous bridge over the Rhine, ju&s;tly admired for the beauty and &s;ingularity of its architec|ture. The river is extremely rapid, and had already de&s;troyed &s;everal bridges of &s;tone, built upon arches of the &s;tronge&s;t con&s;truction; when a carpenter of Apen|zel, undertook to throw a wooden one, of a &s;ingle arch, acro&s;s the river, which is near three thou&s;and feet wide. The magi&s;trates, however, in&s;i&s;ted, that it &s;hould con|&s;i&s;t of two arches, and that he &s;hould make u&s;e, for that purpo&s;e, of the middle pier of the old bridge, which remained entire. Accordingly, the architect was obliged to obey; but he has contrived it in &s;uch a manner, that the bridge is not all &s;upported by the middle pier; and it would certainly have been equally &s;afe, and con&s;iderably more beautiful, had it con&s;i&s;ted &s;olely of one arch. But how &s;hall I attempt to give an idea of it? I who am totally un&s;killed in architec|ture, and who have not the lea&s;t knowledge of draw|ing,
<PB N="67" REF="031692_0067_0FEE0D5B1CBF6BB8">
I &s;hall, however, venture the following de&s;crip|tion, and hope its inaccuracy will be excu&s;ed.</P>
<P>It is a wooden bridge, of which the &s;ides and top are covered, and the road over it is almo&s;t perfectly level. It is what the Germans call a haengewerk, or hanging bridge, the road not being carried, as u&s;u|al, over the top of the arch; but, if I may u&s;e the ex|pre&s;&s;ion, is let down into the middle of it, and there &s;u&s;pended. The middle pier is not ab&s;olutely in a right line with the &s;ide ones that re&s;t upon the &s;hore; as it forms with them a very obtu&s;e angle, pointing down the &s;tream, being eight feet out of the linear di|rection. The di&s;tance of this middle pier from the &s;hore that lies towards the town, is one hundred and &s;eventy-one feet, and from the other &s;ide, one hundred and ninety-three: in all three hundred and &s;ixty four feet; making, in appearance, two arches of a &s;uppri&s;|ing width, and forming the mo&s;t beautiful per&s;pective imaginable, when viewed at &s;ome di&s;tance. A man of the &s;lighte&s;t weight walking upon it, feels it tremble under him: yet waggons, heavily laden, pa&s;s, over it without danger. And although, in the latter in&s;tance, the bridge &s;eems almo&s;t to crack with the pre&s;&s;ure, it does not appear to have &s;uffered the lea&s;t damage. It has been compared, and very ju&s;tly, to a tight rope, which trembles when it is &s;truck, but &s;till pre&s;erves its firm and equal ten&s;ion. I went under this bridge,
<PB N="68" REF="031692_0068_0FEE0D5CA900AC70">
clo&s;e to the middle pier, in order to examine its me|chani&s;m; and though in no re&s;pect a mechanic, I could not help being &s;truck with the elegant &s;implici|ty of the architecture. I was not capable of determin|ing whether it re&s;ts upon the middle pier, but mo&s;t judges agree that it does not.</P>
<P>When one ob&s;erves the greatne&s;s of the plan and the boldne&s;s of the con&s;truction, one is a&s;toni&s;hed that the architect was a common carpenter, without the lea&s;t tincture of literature, totally ignorant of mathe|matics, and not at all ver&s;ed in the theory of mechanics. The name of this extraordinary man was Ulric Gru|benman, an ob&s;cure drunken fellow of Tuffen, a &s;mall village in the canton of Apenzel. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of uncommon natural abilities, and a &s;urpri&s;ing turn for the practical part of mechanics, he rai&s;ed him&s;elf to great eminence in his profe&s;&s;ion, and may ju&s;tly be con&s;idered as one of the mo&s;t ingenious architects of the pre&s;ent century. This bridge was fini&s;hed in le&s;s than three years, and co&s;t 90,000 florins, or about 8000l. &s;terling.</P>
<P>A few days ago, we &s;et out on hor&s;eback, in order to &s;ee the fall of the Rhine at Lauffen, about a league from this place. Our road lay over the hills which form the banks of the Rhine; from whence we had &s;ome fine views of the town and ca&s;tle of Schaffhau|&s;en. The environs are picture&s;que and agreeable:
<PB N="69" REF="031692_0069_0FEE0D5E332E43B0">
the river more beautifully winding through the vale. Upon our arrival at Lauffen, a &s;mall village in the canton of Zuric, we di&s;mounted; and advancing to the edge of the precipice which overhangs the Rhine, we looked down perpendicularly upon the cataract, and &s;aw the river tumbling over the &s;ides of the rock with amazing violence and precipitation. From hence we de&s;cended till we were &s;omewhat below the upper bed of the river, and &s;tood clo&s;e to the fall; &s;o that I could almo&s;t have touched it with my hand. A &s;caf|fold is erected in the very &s;pray of this tremendous cataract, and upon the mo&s;t &s;ublime point of view:&mdash;the &s;ea of foam tumbling down,&mdash;the continual cloud, of &s;pray &s;cattered around at a great di&s;tance, and to a con&s;iderable heighth,&mdash;in &s;hort, the magnificence of the noble &s;cenery far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed my mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations, and exceeds all de&s;cription. Within a|bout an hundred feet, as it appeared to be, of the &s;caf|folding, there are two rocks in the middle of the fall, that prevent one from &s;eeing its whole breadth from this point. The neare&s;t of the&s;e was perforated by the continual action, of the river; and the water forc|ed it&s;elf through in an oblique direction, with inexpre&s;|&s;ible fury, and an hollow &s;ound. After having con|tinued &s;ome time comtemplating in &s;ilent admiration the awful &s;ublimity of this wonderful land&s;cape, we de&s;cended: and below the fall we cro&s;&s;ed the river, which was exceedingly agitated.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="031692_0070_0FEE0D6536C07AC0">
Hitherto I had only viewed the car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aract &s;ideways. But here it opened by degrees, and di&s;played another picture which I enjoyed at my lei&s;ure, as I &s;at my&s;elf down upon the oppo&s;ite bank. The mo&s;t &s;triking ob|jects were on the &s;ide we came from; a ca&s;tle, erected upon the very edge of the precipice, and projecting over the river; near it, a church and &s;ome cottages; on the &s;ide where I was &s;itting, a chump of cottages clo&s;e to the fall; in the back ground, ri&s;ing hills, planted with vines, or tufted with hanging woods; a beautiful little hamlet upon the &s;ummit, &s;kirted with trees; the great body of water, that &s;eemed, as it were, to ru&s;h out from the bottom of the&s;e hills; the two rocks above men|tioned, boldly advancing their heads in the mid&s;t of the fall, and in the very point of its &s;teepe&s;t de&s;cent, their tops covered with &s;hrubs, and dividing the cata|ract into three principal branches. The colour of the Rhine is extremely beautiful, being of a clear &s;ea-green; and I could not but remark the fine effect of the tints, when blended with the white foam in its de&s;cent. There is a plea&s;ing view from an iron foundry clo&s;e to the river, which is dammed up, in order to prevent its carrying away the works and neighbouring cot|tages. By means of this dam, a &s;mall proportion of the river, in its fall, enters a trough, turns a mill, and forms a beautiful little &s;ilver current, gliding down the hare rock, and detached from the main cataract. Be|low

the fall, the river widens con&s;iderably into a more ample ba&s;on. At the fall, the breadth, as well as I could judge by my eye, &s;eemed to be about 250 feet. As to its perpendicular height, travellers differ. Tho&s;e who are given to exaggeration reckon it an hundred feet high. But I &s;hould imagine about fifty feet would be nearer the truth. I &s;tood for &s;ome time upon the brink of the cataract; beheld in admiration, and li&s;|tened in &s;ilence; then cro&s;&s;ed the river, re-mounted my hor&s;e, and returned to Schaffhau&s;en.</P>
<P>Some writers have a&s;&s;erted that the river precipi|tates it&s;elf in one &s;heet of water; and, as I before ob|&s;erved, from a perpendicular heighth of an hundred feet. In former ages this account was probably agree|able to fact; as it is imagined, that the &s;pace between the two banks were once a level rock, and con&s;idera|bly higher; that the river has in&s;en&s;ibly worn away, and undermined tho&s;e parts, on which it broke along with the utmo&s;t violence. For, within the memory of &s;everal of the inhabitants of this town, a large rock has given way, that has greatly altered the view In|deed I am convinced that the perpendicular heighth of the fall becomes le&s;s and le&s;s every year, by the con|tinual friction of &s;o large and rapid a body of water; and have no doubt but that the two rocks, which now ri&s;e in the mid&s;t of the river, will in time, be under|mined and carried away. The river, for &s;ome way be|fore

the fall, even near the bridge, da&s;hes upon a rocky bottom, and renders the navigation impo&s;&s;ible for any kind of ve&s;&s;el. A few weeks ago a countryman of ours tried an experiment with a &s;mall boat, which he contrived to have gently pu&s;hed to the edge of the cat|aract. It &s;hot down entire to the bottom of the fall, was out of &s;ight for a few moments, and then ro&s;e up, da&s;hed into a thou&s;and &s;plinters.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XIII. OF GESNER THE AUTHOR OF THE DEATH OF ABEL, AND LAVATER THE PHYSIOGNOMIST.</HEAD>
<P>ON the &s;econd of Augu&s;t we dined luxuriou&s;ly with the Capuchin friars at Rapper&s;chwyl, who &s;eldom re|gale their gue&s;ts in &s;o &s;umptuous a manner. It was one of their great fea&s;t-days; and accordingly they gave us every po&s;&s;ible variety of fre&s;h-water fi&s;h, with which the lake and the neighbouring rivers abound. The convent is built upon the edge of the water, and commands from &s;ome of the apartments a very agreea|ble pro&s;pect. The library is by far the plea&s;ante&s;t room, though not the mo&s;t frequented. The cells of
<PB N="73" REF="031692_0073_0FEE0D706658F0B8">
of the monks are &s;mall, and yet not inconvenient; but cleanline&s;s does not &s;eem to con&s;titute any part of their moral or religious ob&s;ervances. Indeed the ve|ry habit of the order is ill calculated for that purpo&s;e, as they wear no &s;hirt or &s;tockings, and are clothed in a cour&s;e kind of a brown drugget robe, which trails upon the ground. Strange idea of &s;anctity! as if dirt could be acceptable to the Deity. I reflected with particular &s;atisfaction, that I was not born a member of the Ro|man Catholic church; as perhaps the commands of a parent, a &s;udden di&s;appointment, or a momentary fit of enthu&s;ia&s;m, might have &s;ent me to a convent of Capuchins, and have wedded me to dirt and &s;uper&s;ti|tion for life.</P>
<P>After dinner we took leave of our ho&s;ts, and depart|ed for Zuric by water. The lake of Zuric is near ten leagues in length, and one in breadth. The city &s;tands upon a gentle eminence on the northern extremi|ty of the lake; a beautiful &s;ituation, and advantageous for commerce. For by means of the river Limmat, which i&s;&s;ues from the lake, and dividing the town, falls into the Aar, there is a communication with the Rhine. And this advantage has not been neglected; as the trade of the town is verey exten&s;ive. The inhabitants are exceedingly indu&s;trious, and carry on with &s;ucce&s;s &s;everal different branches of manufacture; the princi|pal is that of crape. Their chief traffic is with France, Ru&s;&s;ia, Italy, and Holland.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="031692_0074_0FEE0D71F3313D68">
Since the reformation many per&s;ons have flouri&s;hed here, eminent for their learning in all branches of lite|rature: and there is no town in Swi&s;&s;erland, where letters are more encouraged, or where they are culti|vated with greater &s;ucce&s;s. I waited this morning upon the celebrated Ge&s;ner, author of the Death of Abel, and &s;everal other performances, which for their delicate and elegant &s;implicity are ju&s;tly e&s;teemed. They abound with tho&s;e nice touches of exqui&s;ite &s;en|&s;ibility, which di&s;cover a mind warmed with the fine&s;t &s;entiments; and love is repre&s;ented in the cha&s;te&s;t col|ouring of innocence, virtue, and benevolence. Nor has he confined his &s;ubjects merely to the tender pa&s;|&s;ion. Paternal affection, and filial reverence; grati|tude, humanity; in &s;hort, every moral duty is ex|hibited and inculcated in the mo&s;t plea&s;ing and affect|ing manner. He has for &s;ometime renounced poetry in order to take up the pencil; and painting is at pre|&s;ent his favourite amu&s;ement. A treati&s;e which he has publi&s;hed on land&s;cape-painting, &s;hows the ele|gance of his ta&s;te, and the ver&s;atility of his genius; while his compo&s;itions in both kinds prove the re&s;em|blance of the two arts; and that the conceptions of the poet and of the painter are congenial. I prefer his drawings in black and white to his paintings; for, although the ideas in both are equally beautiful or &s;ub|lime, his colouring is inferior to his de&s;ign. He is
<PB N="75" REF="031692_0075_0FEE0D7550957FA8">
preparing an hand&s;ome edition of his writings in quar|to, in which every part of the work is carried on by him&s;elf. He prints them at his own private pre&s;s, and is at once both the drawer and engraver of his plates. It is to be lamented that he has renounced poetry; for, while ordinary writers &s;pring up in great plenty, au|thors of real genius are rare and uncommon. His drawings are &s;een only by a few, and will &s;carcely be known to po&s;terity. But his writings are di&s;per&s;ed abroad, tran&s;lated into every language, and will be ad|mired by future ages, as long as there remains any re|li&s;h for true pa&s;toral &s;implicity, or any ta&s;te for origi|nal compo&s;ition. He is plain in his manners; open, affable, and obliging in his addre&s;s; and of &s;ingular mode&s;ty. He has nothing of the poet in his appear|ance, except in his eye, which is full of &s;en&s;e, fire, and expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>We waited al&s;o on Mr. Lavater, a clergyman of Zu|ric, and celebrated phy&s;iognomi&s;t, who has publi&s;hed a famous treati&s;e on that fanciful &s;ubject. He expre&s;&s;|ed him&s;elf badly in French; but there was an agreeable warmth and vivacity in his countenance and manner, while he conver&s;ed upon his favourite &s;ubject. That particular pa&s;&s;ions have a certain effect upon particu|lar features, is evident to the mo&s;t common ob&s;erver; and it may be conceived, that an habitual indulgence of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions may po&s;&s;ibly, in &s;ome ca&s;es, impre&s;s
<PB N="76" REF="031692_0076_0FEE0D78AD7AB340">
a di&s;tingui&s;hing mark on the countenance. But that a certain ca&s;t of features con&s;tantly denotes certain pa&s;&s;ions; and that by contemplating the former, we can infallibly di&s;cover al&s;o the mental qualities of the owner, is an hypothe&s;is liable, I &s;hould think, to &s;o many exceptions, that no general and uniform &s;y&s;tem could be ju&s;tly formed upon it. Neverthele&s;s Mr. Lavater, like a true enthu&s;ia&s;t, carries his theory much farther. For he not only pretends to di&s;cover the cha|racters and pa&s;&s;ions by the features, by the complex|ion, by the form of the hand, and by the motion of the arms, but he al&s;o draws &s;ome inferences of the &s;ame kind even from one's hand-writing. And indeed his &s;y&s;tem is formed upon &s;uch univer&s;al principles, that he applies the &s;ame rules to all animated nature, extending them not only to brutes, but even to in&s;ects. That the temper of a hor&s;e may be di&s;covered by his countenance, does not &s;trike one as any thing ab&s;urd. But was it ever heard before that any quality could be inferred from the phy&s;iognomy of a Bee, or of an Ant? While I give my opinion thus freely concerning Mr. Lavater's notions, it will be readily perceived, that I am not one of tho&s;e, who are initiated into the my&s;te|ries of his art. Nor do I mean to cen&s;ure indi&s;crimi|nately the &s;y&s;tem of that celebrated writer. For, not|with&s;tanding the extravagance of &s;ome of his tenets, the &s;evere&s;t critics allow, that there is a fund of good &s;en&s;e and a variety of fine ob&s;ervations di&s;per&s;ed
<PB N="77" REF="031692_0077_0FEE0D7E05635178">
throughout his treati&s;e; and that it is one of tho&s;e works, which, to be admired, needs only to be read with attention.</P>
<P>The clergy of Zuric are in general better paid than in the other Prote&s;tant cantons; and among that body there are &s;ome who are very decently provided for; a circum&s;tance rather uncommon in the Reformed or Pre&s;byterian churches.</P>
<P>Sumptuary laws, as well as tho&s;e again&s;t immorali|ty, are here well ob&s;erved. The former indeed may exi&s;t, and be carried into execution even among a peo|ple much corrupted; for it may be the policy of gov|ernment to enforce their ob&s;ervance. But the &s;evere&s;t penalties will not be &s;ufficient to prevent crimes of an immoral tendency, amid&s;t a general di&s;&s;olutene&s;s of manners. It is the popular principles that can alone invigorate &s;uch laws, and give them their full opera|tion. Among the Romans, the laws again&s;t adultery were &s;evere; and yet where was adultery more practi&s;|ed than at Rome? In Zuric it is rigorou&s;ly puni&s;hed, without any di&s;tinction of rank, by fine, by expul&s;ion from office, and by impri&s;onment. But the frequency of this crime is not &s;o much re&s;trained by the penalty annexed to it, as from the general good morals of the inhabitants. Secret crimes cannot be prevented; but it is an evident proof of public virtue, when open breaches of morality are di&s;countenanced. Among their &s;umptuary laws, the u&s;e of a carriage in the town
<PB N="78" REF="031692_0078_0FEE0D7F90BCED68">
is prohibited to all &s;orts of per&s;ons except &s;trangers. And, it is almo&s;t inconceivable that, in a place &s;o very commercial and wealthy, luxury &s;hould &s;o little prevail.</P>
<P>The bublic granary, on account of its admirable in|&s;titution, de&s;erves to be particularly mentioned. Corn is purcha&s;ed by government, and given out to tho&s;e who chu&s;e to buy it at the common price; but in &s;ea|&s;ons of &s;carcity it is &s;old con&s;iderably cheaper than it can be bought at the market. The u&s;e of this in&s;titu|tion appeared in the late dearth; when bread, from the dearne&s;s of corn, was &s;old at ten pence the pound, gov|ernment delivered the &s;ame quantity for four pence.</P>
<P>The ar&s;enal is well &s;upplied with cannon, arms, and amunition; and contains a re&s;erve of mu&s;kets for thir|ty thou&s;and men. We &s;aw there, and admired, &s;ome of the two-handed &s;words and weighty armour of the old Swi&s;s warriors; as al&s;o the bow and arrow, with which William Tell is &s;aid to have &s;hot the apple off the head of his &s;on.</P>

Some of the&s;e rang|es appeard to us about an hundred and fifty feet high; but, if we may believe our guides, they are four hun|dred feet above their real ba&s;e. Near them were py|ramids and cones of ice of all forms and &s;izes, &s;hoot|ing up to a very con&s;iderable height, in the mo&s;t beau|tiful and fanta&s;tic &s;hapes imaginable. From this Gla|cier, which we cro&s;&s;ed without much difficulty, we had a fine view of the value of Chamouni.</P>
<P>On the 24th, we propo&s;ed &s;allying forth very early, in order to go to the Valley of Ice, in the Glacier of Montanvert, and to penetrate as far as the time would admit; but the weather proving cloudy, and likely to rain, we deferred &s;etting out till nine, when appearan|ces gave us the hope of its clearing up. Accordingly
<PB N="80" REF="031692_0080_0FEE0D88F98CD960">
we procured three excellent guides, and a&s;cended on hor&s;eback &s;ome part of the way over the mountain, which leads to the Glacier above-mentioned. We were then obliged to di&s;mount, and &s;crambled up the re&s;t of the mountains, (chiefly covered with pines) a|long a &s;teep and rugged path called "the road of the chry&s;tal-hunters." From the &s;ummit of Montanvert we de&s;cended a little to the edge of the Glacier, and made a refre&s;hing meal upon &s;ome cold provi&s;ion which we brought with us. A large block of gra|nite, called "<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Engli&s;h Stone.</NOTE> La Pierre des Anglois," &s;erved us for a table; and near us was a mi&s;erable hovel, where tho&s;e who make expeditions towards Mont Blanc, frequent|ly pa&s;s the night. The &s;cene around us was magnifi|cent and &s;ublime; numberle&s;s rocks ri&s;ing boldly a|bove the clouds, &s;ome of who&s;e tops were bare, others covered with &s;now. Many of the&s;e, gradually dimin|i&s;hing towards their &s;ummits, end in &s;harp points; and from this circum&s;tance they are called the <HI>Needles.</HI> Between the&s;e rocks the Valley of Ice &s;tretched &s;everal leagues in length, and is nearly a mile broad; extend|ing on one &s;ide towards Mont Blanc, and, on the other, towards the plain of Chamount.</P>
<P>After we had &s;ufficiently refre&s;hed our&s;elves, we drepared for our adventure acro&s;s the ice. We had each of us a long pole &s;piked with iron; and, in order
<PB N="81" REF="031692_0081_0FEE0D8A8AFCD9D8">
to &s;ecure us as much as po&s;&s;ible from &s;lipping, the guides fa&s;tened to our &s;hoes <HI>crampons,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of a &s;mall bar of iron, to which are fixed four &s;mall &s;pikes of the &s;ame metal.</P>
<P>The difficulty of cro&s;&s;ing the&s;e valleys of ice, ari&s;es from the immen&s;e cha&s;ms. They are produced by &s;everal cau&s;es; but more particularly by the continual melting of the interior &s;urface. This frequently occa|&s;ions a &s;inking of the ice; and under &s;uch circum&s;tan|ces, the whole ma&s;s is &s;uddenly rent a&s;under in that particular place with a mo&s;t violent explo&s;ion. We rolled down large &s;tones into &s;everal of them, and the great length of time before they reached the bottom, gave us &s;ome conception of their depth. Our guides a&s;&s;ured us, that in &s;ome places they are five hundred feet deep. I can no otherwi&s;e convey to you an im|age of this immen&s;e body of ice, con&s;i&s;ting of continu|ed irregular ridges and deep cha&s;ms, than by re&s;em|bling it to a raging &s;ea, that had been in&s;tantaneou&s;ly frozen in the mid&s;t of a violent &s;torm.</P>
<P>We began our walk with great &s;lowne&s;s and delibera|tion, but we gradually gained more courage and con|fidence as we advanced; and we &s;oon found that we could &s;afely pa&s;s along tho&s;e parts, where the a&s;cent and de&s;cent were not very con&s;iderable, much fa&s;ter even than when walking at the rate of our common pace. In other parts we leaped over the clefts, and
<PB N="82" REF="031692_0082_0FEE0D8C18EAE030">
&s;lid down the &s;teeper de&s;cents as well as we could. In one place where we de&s;cended, and &s;tepped acro&s;s an opening upon a narrow ridge of ice &s;carcely three in|ches broad, we were obliged to tread with peculiar caution; for on each &s;ide were cha&s;ms of a great depth. We walked &s;ome paces &s;ideways along this ridge; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ept acro&s;s the cha&s;m into a little hollow, which the guides made on purpo&s;e for our feet, and got up an a&s;cent, by means of &s;mall holes, which we made with the &s;pikes of our poles. All this &s;ounds terrible; b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> at the time we had none of us the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ions of danger, as the guides were exceedingly careful, and took excellent precautions. One of our &s;ervants had the courage to follow us without <HI>crampons,</HI> and with no nails to his &s;hoes, which was certainly dangerous, on account of the &s;lipperine&s;s of the leather when wet|ted. He got along, however, &s;urpri&s;ingly well: though in &s;ome places we were alarmed, le&s;t he &s;hould &s;lip up|on the edge of one of tho&s;e cha&s;ms; for had that acci|dent happened to any of us, we mu&s;t inevitably have been lo&s;t, having neglected to provide our&s;elves with long ropes in ca&s;e of &s;uch an event. This man was probably the fir&s;t per&s;on who ever ventured acro&s;s the Valley of Ice, without either <HI>crampons</HI> or nails to his &s;hoes.</P>
<P>We were now almo&s;t arrived at the other extremity, when we were &s;topped by a cha&s;m &s;o broad that there
<PB N="83" REF="031692_0083_0FEE0D9317AA74D8">
was no po&s;&s;ibility of pa&s;&s;ing it. We were obliged to make a circuit of above a quarter of a mile, in order to get round this va&s;t opening. This will give you &s;ome idea of the difficulty attending excur&s;ions over &s;ome of the&s;e Glaciers; and our guides informed us, that when they hunt the <HI>chamois</HI> and the <HI>marmottes</HI> in the&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> regions, the&s;e unavoidable circuits generally carry them &s;ix or &s;even miles about, when they would have only two miles to go if they could proceed in a &s;traight line.</P>
<P>A &s;torm threatening us every moment, we were o|bliged to ha&s;ten off the Glacier as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, for rain renders the ice exceedingly &s;lippery; and in ca&s;e of a fog (which generally accompaneis a &s;torm in the&s;e upper regions) our &s;ituation would have been extreme|ly dangerous. And indeed we had no time to lo&s;e; for the tempe&s;t began ju&s;t as we had quitted the ice, and &s;oon became very violent, attended with frequent fla&s;hes of lightning, and loud peals of thunder, which being re-echoed within the hollows of the mountains, added greatly to the awful &s;ublimity of the &s;cene. We now de&s;cended a very &s;teep precipice, and for &s;ome way were obliged to crawl upon our hands and feet down a bare rock; the &s;torm at the &s;ame time roaring over us, and rendering the rock extremely &s;lippery. We were by this time quite wet through, but we got to the bottom, however, without much hurt. Upon
<PB N="84" REF="031692_0084_0FEE0D94A40D7A18">
ob&s;erving the immen&s;e extent of the&s;e Glaciers, I could not help remarking, (and it is a circum&s;tance which many other travellers have ob&s;erved before) what a fund is here laid up for the &s;upply of rivers, and that the &s;ources which give ri&s;e to the Rhine, the Rhone, and the Po, will never fail. I returned at length to the inn, as dripping wet as if I had been plunged into water, but perfectly &s;atisfied with my ex|pedition.</P>
<P>I cannot conceive any &s;ubject in natural hi&s;tory more curious than the formation and progre&s;s of the&s;e Glaciers; running far into fields of corn and rich pa&s;|ture, and lying, without being melted, in a &s;ituation where the &s;un has power &s;ufficient to ripen the fruits of the field. It is literally true, that with one hand we could touch ice, and with the other ripe corn. But as this is a &s;ubject too important to be treated &s;u|perficially, and requires much accurate ob&s;ervation, and repeated experimental inve&s;tigation, I &s;hall not at|tempt to enter into it. I beg leave neverthele&s;s, to make one ob&s;ervation, which will &s;erve to prove the occa&s;ional increa&s;e and diminution of the Glaciers, contrary to the opinion of &s;ome philo&s;ophers, who ad|vance that they remain always the &s;ame; and of oth|ers, who a&s;&s;ert that they are continually increa&s;ing. I think I may venture to a&s;&s;ert, that both the&s;e opini|ons are untenable; and it happens in this, as in many
<PB N="85" REF="031692_0085_0FEE0D9631D4A338">
other &s;ubjects, that experience and truth are &s;acrificed to the &s;upporting of a favourite hypothe&s;is. Indeed the fact &s;eems to be, that the&s;e Glaciers in &s;ome years, increa&s;e con&s;iderably in extent, while in others they recede; and of this I am perfectly convinced from the following circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>The borders of the Valley of Ice of the Glacier of Montanvert are mo&s;tly &s;kirted with trees. Towards its foot a va&s;t arch of ice ri&s;es to near an hundred feet in heighth; from under which, the continued drop|pings from the melting of the ice and &s;now are collect|ed together, and form the Arveron, which ru&s;hes forth with con&s;iderable force, and in a large body of water. As we approached the extremity of this arch, we pa&s;&s;|ed through a wood of firs. Tho&s;e which &s;tand at a little di&s;tance from the ice are about eighty feet high, and are undoubtedly of a very great age. Between the&s;e and the Glacier, the trees are of a later growth, as is evident as well from their inferior &s;ize, as from their texture and &s;hape. Others, which re&s;emble the latter, have been overturned and enveloped in the ice. In all the&s;e &s;everal trees, re&s;pectively &s;ituated in the &s;pots I have mentioned, there &s;eems to be a kind of regular gradation in their age, from the large&s;t &s;ize to tho&s;e that lie pro&s;trate.</P>
<P>The&s;e facts fairly lead, it &s;hould &s;eem, to the follow|ing conclu&s;ions;&mdash;that the Glacier once extended as
<PB N="86" REF="031692_0086_0FEE0D9D65E6CA10">
far as the row of tall firs; that, upon its retiring, a number of trees have &s;hot up in the very &s;pots, which it formerly occupied; that within &s;ome years the Gla|cier has again begun to advance, and in its progre&s;s has overturned the trees of later date, before they have had time to grow up to any con&s;iderable heighth.</P>
<P>To the&s;e circum&s;tances, another fact may be added, which appears to me convincing. There are large &s;tones of granite, which are found only at a &s;mall di&s;|tance from the extremities of the Glacier. The&s;e are va&s;t fragments, which have certainly fallen down from the mountains upon the ice, have been carried on by the Glacier in its increa&s;e, and have tumbled into the plain, upon the melting or &s;inking of the ice which &s;upported them.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XV. OF BERNE, IN SWISSERLAND.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS very much &s;truck upon my entrance into Berne, with its &s;ingular neatne&s;s and beauty. I do not remember to have &s;een any town (Bath alone except|ed) the fir&s;t appearance whereof had &s;o plea&s;ing an ef|fect.
<PB N="87" REF="031692_0087_0FEE0D9EF1F91B28">
The principal &s;treet is broad and long; the hou&s;es are mo&s;tly uniform, built of a greyi&s;h &s;tone up|on arcades, which are admirably well paved. Through the middle of the &s;treet runs a lively &s;tream of the cleare&s;t water, in a channel con&s;tructed for its recep|tion. But be&s;ides this &s;tream, it abounds with foun|tains, not le&s;s ornamental to the place than beneficial to the inhabitants. The river Aar flows clo&s;e by the town, and indeed almo&s;t &s;urrounds it, winding its &s;er|pentine cour&s;e over a rocky bottom, much below the level of the &s;treets; and for a con&s;iderable way form|ing by its banks, which are &s;teep and craggy, a kind of natural rampart. The cathedral church is a noble piece of Gothic architecture. It &s;tands upon a plat|form that has been rai&s;ed at a great expence from the bed of the river, and which commands as fine a view as any I have &s;een in Swi&s;&s;erland.</P>
<P>The country around is richly cultivated, and agree|ably diver&s;ified with hills, lawns, wood, and water; the river flows rapidly below, and an abrupt chain of high and rugged Alps appears at &s;ome di&s;tance, the tops whereof are covered with eternal &s;now. Such an a&s;|&s;emblage of beautiful objects would, in any view, pre|&s;ent a mo&s;t &s;triking pro&s;pect; but its effect becomes greatly heightened when &s;een from the mid&s;t of a large town.</P>
<P>All the public buildings are in a mo&s;t noble &s;impli|city
<PB N="88" REF="031692_0088_0FED37898AEFF8F8">
of &s;tyle, and announce the riches and grandeur of the republic. The ar&s;enal contains arms for &s;ixty thou&s;and men, be&s;ides a con&s;iderable quantity of cannon which were ca&s;t here. The granary is an excellent in&s;titution, &s;imilar to that of Zuric; but it differs from that of Geneva, as the expence does not fall chiefly upon the poor: for the bakers are not compelled by government to purcha&s;e their corn from the public magazine.</P>
<P>The ho&s;pitals, which are large, airy, and well bulit, are excellently regulated, both with re&s;pect to the care and attention paid to the &s;ick, and to the cleanline&s;s of the &s;everal wards. The town is kept neat by a num|ber of felons, who are &s;entenced to this drudgery dur|ing a certain time, according to the nature of their of|fences; and as capital condemnations are very rare, this is the mo&s;t u&s;ual manner of puni&s;hing their cri|minals. The&s;e culprits are di&s;tingui&s;hed by an iron collar, with a hook projecting over their heards.</P>
<P>The library is a &s;mall, but well cho&s;en collection, and contains &s;ome very curious manu&s;cripts. Of the&s;e, Mr. Sinner, a man of great erudition, has pub|li&s;hed a very &s;atisfactory and judicious catalogue. He has not only &s;et forth their titles, and a&s;certained their age, but has al&s;o given a general and &s;uccinct account of their re&s;pective &s;ubjects; and from many of them has publi&s;hed extracts equally curious and intere&s;ting.
<PB N="89" REF="031692_0089_0FEE0DA78BA239C8">
Among the&s;e manu&s;cripts are &s;ome of the thirteenth century, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal &s;ongs and romances of the Troubadours, written in that and the preceding ages, which merit the attention of tho&s;e who are con|ver&s;ant in that &s;pecies of ancient poetry.</P>
<P>I have been much di&s;appointed in not &s;eeing the great Haller. His very infirm &s;tate of health would not admit of his receiving a vi&s;it from us. I need not mention how eminently that celebrated author has di&s;|tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in every &s;pecies of polite literature, and in &s;everal branches of natural philo&s;ophy. Unlike certain minute philo&s;ophers of the pre&s;ent age, who&s;e athei&s;tical and infidel writings are too well known, and too widely di&s;&s;emminated, this great man is &s;o unfa&s;h|ionable as to have followed the &s;teps of a Locke and a Newton; and to have proved him&s;elf, both in his life and his writings, a zealous friend and able advocate of Chri&s;tianity. When literature and philo&s;ophy, in|&s;tead of being employed, as they too often have been, in &s;upporting &s;ceptical tenets by artful &s;ophi&s;try, thus lend their joint a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the cau&s;e of religion, it is then only that they become an honour to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, and a benefit to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Learning is neither &s;o univer&s;ally encouraged, nor &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully cultivated here as at Zuric. The acade|mical &s;tudies are almo&s;t &s;olely directed to tho&s;e branch|es of knowledge more e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary for entering
<PB N="90" REF="031692_0090_0FEE0DA917F2BCC0">
into the church. The &s;ociety for the promotion of agriculture, is almo&s;t the only e&s;tabli&s;hment which di|rectly tends to the progre&s;s of the arts and &s;ciences; and even this meets with no great countenance from government. There is but little trade in the capital. Some few manufactures indeed (chiefly of linen and &s;ilk) have been e&s;tabli&s;hed; but they are carried on by tho&s;e only who have no pro&s;pect of being admit|ted into the &s;overeign council. For tho&s;e famalies, who have any influence on public affairs, would hold them&s;elves degraded were they to engage in any branch of commerce; and as offices of the &s;tate, except bail|liages, are in general not very profitable, nor indeed, numerous, many of them enter, as their &s;ole re&s;ource, into sovereign armies. With re&s;pect to tho&s;e among them who have &s;ufficient intere&s;t to be cho&s;en into the &s;overeign council, they mu&s;t have attained the full age of twenty-nine before they are eligible. In the mean while, as very few of them apply their minds to literary pur&s;uits, they u&s;ually, from mere want of em|ployment, wa&s;te the interval in an idle and di&s;&s;ipated cour&s;e of life. Neverthele&s;s, there are &s;everal mem|bers of the &s;overeign council, who are ju&s;tly di&s;tingui&s;h|ed for their political abilities; and, being thoroughly acquainted with the re&s;pective intere&s;ts of the differ|ent powers of Europe, they know perfectly well how to avail them&s;elves of every conjuncture, which may
<PB N="91" REF="031692_0091_0FEE0DAE5B1B0E70">
be turned to the advantage or the glory of their own republic.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Berne value them&s;elves much upon their politene&s;s to &s;trangers. And indeed, it is but doing them &s;trict ju&s;tice to acknowledge, that they have &s;hown us (with that peculiar frankne&s;s and unaf|fected affability I have &s;o often had occa&s;ion to admire in the Swi&s;s) every civility in their power.</P>

But this, as one may perceive, that in proportion, bread is much dearer than the other articles, and the rea&s;on is obvious; for all the&s;e mountainous parts con&s;i&s;t almo&s;t entirely of pa&s;turages, and produce little corn. The pea&s;ants of Swi&s;&s;erland (I mean tho&s;e who inhabit the mountainous di&s;tricts) live chiefly upon milk, and what re&s;ults from it, together with potatoes, which are here much cultivated. According to the price of provi&s;ions in England, the above li&s;t will ap|pear exceedingly cheap; but then it ought, at the &s;ame time, to be con&s;idered, that money is very &s;carce in the&s;e parts. Nor indeed is it &s;o much nece&s;&s;ary in a country, where there is no luxury; where all the pea|&s;antry have, within them&s;elves, more than &s;ufficient for their own con&s;umption; and are tolerably well provi|ded with every nece&s;&s;ary of life from their own little deme&s;nes. I had a long conver&s;ation with one of the lads, who came with us from Altdorf, and takes care of the hor&s;es. He lives upon the mountains of Uri; and, as their winter la&s;ts near eight months of the year, dur|ing &s;ome part of which time there can be little com|munication between the &s;everal cottages, every fami|ly is of cour&s;e obliged to lay in their provi&s;ion for the whole winter. His own, it &s;eems, con&s;i&s;ts of &s;even per&s;ons, and is provided with the following &s;tores;&mdash;Seven chee&s;es, each weighing twenty-five pounds; an hundred and eight pounds of hard bread, twenty-five

ba&s;kets of potatoes, each weighing about forty pounds; &s;even goats, and three cows, one of which they kill. The cows and hor&s;es (if they keep any) are fed with hay, and the goats with the boughs of firs; which in a &s;carcity of hay, they give al&s;o to their other cattle. During this dreary &s;ea&s;on the family are employed in making linen, &s;hirts, &amp;c. &s;ufficient for their own u&s;e: and, for this purpo&s;e, a &s;mall patch of the little piece of ground belonging to every cottage, is generally &s;own with flax. The cultivation of the latter has been much attended to and with increa&s;ing &s;ucce&s;s, in the&s;e moun|tainous parts of Swi&s;&s;erland.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es are generally built of wood; and it was a natural remark of one of our &s;ervants, as we pa&s;&s;ed through &s;uch a continued chain of rocks, that as there was &s;tone enough to build all the cottages in the coun|try, it was wonderful they &s;hould u&s;e nothing but wood for that purpo&s;e; a remark that has been made by many travellers. But it &s;hould &s;eem, that the&s;e wood|en hou&s;es are much &s;ooner con&s;tructed, and are ea&s;ily repaired; that they are built in &s;o &s;olid and compact a manner (the rooms &s;mall, and the ceilings low) as to be &s;ufficiently warm even for &s;o cold a climate. The chief objection to them ari&s;es from the danger of fire; as the flames mu&s;t rage with great rapidity, and com|municate ea&s;ily from one to the other. This incon|venience however, is in a great mea&s;ure obviated by
<PB N="94" REF="031692_0094_0FEE0DB886032770">
the method of building their cottages apart; all their villages con&s;i&s;ting of detached and &s;cattered hamlets. But this ob&s;ervation does not hold with re&s;pect to &s;ome of their large&s;t burghs; and the&s;e mu&s;t con&s;equently be expo&s;ed to the ravages of this mo&s;t dreadful of all calamities.</P>

<PB N="95" REF="031692_0095_0FEE0DBA12AC9FD8">
into little independent republics, clo&s;ely border|ing upon each other, and of cour&s;e having occa&s;ional|ly interfering intere&s;ts, having continued, during &s;o long a period, in an almo&s;t uninterrupted &s;tate of tran|quility. And thus, while the &s;everal neighbouring kingdoms have &s;uffered, by turns, all the horrors of in|ternal war, this favoured nation hath enjoyed the feli|city de&s;cribed by Lucretius, and looked down with &s;ecurity upon the various tempe&s;ts, which have &s;ha|ken the world around them.</P>
<P>But the happine&s;s of a long peace, has neither bro|ken the &s;pirit, not enervated the arm of this people. The youth are diligently trained to all the martial ex|erci&s;es, &s;uch as running, wre&s;tling, and &s;hooting both with the cro&s;s-bow and the mu&s;ket; a con&s;iderable number of well di&s;ciplined Swi&s;s troops are always em|ployed in foreign &s;ervices; and the whole people are enrolled, and regularly exerci&s;ed in their re&s;pective militia. By the&s;e means they are capable, in ca&s;e it &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary, of collecting a very re&s;pectable body of forces, which could not fail of proving formi|dable to any enemy, who &s;hould invade their country, or attack their liberties. Thus, while mo&s;t of the o|ther &s;tates upon the continent are tending more and more towards a military government, Swi&s;&s;erland alone has no &s;tanding armies; and yet; from the nature of its &s;ituation, from its particular alliances, and from the
<PB N="96" REF="031692_0096_0FEE0DBD6C8A7B28">
policy of its internal government, is more &s;ecure from inva&s;ion than any other European power, and full as able to with&s;tand the greate&s;t force that can be brought again&s;t it.</P>
<P>But the felicity of Swi&s;&s;erland does not con&s;i&s;t mere|ly in being peculiarly exempted from the burdens and mi&s;eries of war; there is no country in which happi|ne&s;s and content more univer&s;ally prevail among the people. For, whether the government be ari&s;tocrati|cal, democratical, or mixed; ab&s;olute or limited; a general &s;pirit of liberty pervades and actuates the &s;ev|eral con&s;titutions; &s;o that even the eligarchical &s;tates (which, of all others, are u&s;ually the mo&s;t tyrannical) are here peculiarly mild; and the property of the &s;ub|ject is &s;ecurely guarded again&s;t every kind of viola|tion.</P>
<P>But there is one general defect in their criminal ju|ri&s;prudence, which prevails throughout this country. For although the Caroline code, as it is &s;tyled, or the code of the Emperor Charles V. forms in each of the republics, the principal ba&s;is of their penal laws, with particular modifications and additions in different di&s;tricts, yet much too great a latitude is allowed to the re&s;pective judges, who are le&s;s governed in their determinations by this code, or any other written law, than by the common principles of ju&s;tice. How far long experience may have ju&s;tified the prudence of tru&s;ting them with this extraordinary privilege, I can|not
<PB N="97" REF="031692_0097_0FEE0DC44CF3B068">
&s;ay; but di&s;cretionary powers, of this kind are un|doubtedly liable to the mo&s;t alarming abu&s;e, and can never, without the greate&s;t hazard, be committed to the hands of the magi&s;trate.</P>
<P>I cannot forbear reflecting, upon this occa&s;ion, on the &s;uperior wi&s;dom, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, as well as in many others, of our own mo&s;t invaluable con&s;ti|tution; and indeed, it is impo&s;&s;ible for an Engli&s;hman to ob&s;erve, in his travels, the governments of other countries, without becoming a warmer or more affec|tionate admirer of his own. In England, the life and liberty of the &s;ubject does not depend upon the arbi|trary dici&s;ion of his judge, but is &s;ecured by expre&s;s laws, from which no magi&s;trate can depart with impu|nity. This guarded preci&s;ion, it is true, may occa|&s;ionally, perhaps, be attended with &s;ome inconvenien|cies; but they are over-balanced by advantages of &s;o much greater weight, as to be &s;carcely perceptible in the &s;cales of ju&s;tice. I do not mean, however, to throw any imputation upon the officers of criminal juri&s;dic|tion in Swi&s;&s;erland. As far as I could ob&s;erve, they admini&s;ter di&s;tributive ju&s;tice with an impartial and equitable hand.</P>
<P>One cannot but be a&s;toni&s;hed, as well as concerned, to find, that, in a country where the true principles of civil government are &s;o well under&s;tood, and &s;o gene|rally adopted as in Swi&s;&s;erland, the trial by torture is
<PB N="98" REF="031692_0098_0FED378CA75E2FA0">
yet aboli&s;hed. For in &s;ome particular ca&s;es, the &s;u&s;|pected criminal is &s;till put to the rack. The ineffica|cy, no le&s;s than the inhumanity, of endeavouring to extort the truth by the &s;everal horrid in&s;truments, which too ingenious cruelty have devi&s;ed for that pur|po&s;e, has been &s;o often expo&s;ed by the able&s;t writers, that it would be equally impertinent and &s;uperfluous to trouble the world with any reflections of mine up|on the &s;ubject. And indeed, the whole &s;trength of the &s;everal arguments, which have been urged upon this occa&s;ion, is compri&s;ed in the very ju&s;t and pointed ob|&s;ervation of the admirable Bruyere, that "<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The torture is a wonderful invention, and very certain of de&s;troying an innocent per&s;on, who has a delicate con&s;titu|tion; and of &s;aying a guilty one, to whom nature has been more kind.</NOTE> la que&s;tion e&s;t une invention marveilleu&s;e et tout-a-fait &s;ure, pour perdre un innocent qui a la complexion foible, et &s;au|ver un coupable qui e&s;t ne robu&s;te." I cannot howe|ver but add, in ju&s;tice to the Swi&s;s, that zealous advo|cates have not been wanting among them for the total abolition of torture. But arguments of rea&s;on, and &s;entiments of humanity, have been found, even in this civilized and enlightened country, to avail little again&s;t inveterate cu&s;tom and long confirmed preju|dices.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="031692_0099_0FEE0DC5D79454C8">
Criminal ju&s;tice is in Swi&s;&s;erland, as in the great|e&s;t part of Europe, admini&s;tered agreeable to the rules of the civil law. According to the maxims of that code, the criminal's confe&s;&s;ion is ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite, in order to his &s;uffering capital puni&s;hment; and con|&s;equently, all tho&s;e nations, who have not e&s;tabli&s;hed a new code of criminal juri&s;prudence, retain the u&s;e of torture.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent king of Pru&s;&s;ia, it is well known, &s;et the example in Germany, of aboli&s;hing this inhuman practice, but few, perhaps, are appri&s;ed, that the fir&s;t hint of this reformation was &s;ugge&s;ted to him by read|ing the Hi&s;tory of England. For, one of the princi|pal arguments in &s;upport of this method of extorting confe&s;&s;ion, being, that it affords the be&s;t means of di&s;|covering plots again&s;t government, the &s;agacious mon|arch remarked, that the Briti&s;h annals fully confute the fallacy of that rea&s;oning. Few kingdoms, he ob|&s;erved, had abounded more in con&s;piracies and rebel|lions than England; and yet that the leaders and abet|tors of them had been more &s;ucce&s;sfully traced and di&s;covered, without the u&s;e of torture, than in any country where it was practi&s;ed. "From thence," ad|ded this wi&s;e politician, &s;peaking upon the &s;ubject, "I &s;aw the ab&s;urdity of torture, and aboli&s;hed it ac|cordingly."</P>
<P>The above anecdote, which I had from very re&s;pec|table
<PB N="100" REF="031692_0100_0FEE0F15335FA068">
authority, bears the mo&s;t honourable te&s;timony to the efficacy as well as the mildne&s;s of our penal laws, and to the &s;uperior excellency of the proce&s;s ob|&s;erved in our courts of criminal ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to agriculture; there is, perhaps, no country in the world where the advantageous effects of unwearied and per&s;evering indu&s;try are more remarka|bly con&s;picuous. In travelling over the mountainous parts of Swi&s;&s;erland, I was &s;truck with admiration and a&s;toni&s;hment, to ob&s;erve rocks, that were formerly bar|ren, now planted with vines, or abounding in rich pa&s;ture; to mark the traces of the plough, along the &s;ide of the precipices, &s;o &s;teep, that it mu&s;t be with great difficulty, that a hor&s;e could even mount them. In a word, the inhabitants &s;eem to have &s;urmounted every ob&s;truction which &s;oil, &s;ituation, and climate, had thrown in their way, and to have &s;pread fertility over various &s;pots of the country, which nature &s;eem|ed to have con&s;igned to everla&s;ting barrenne&s;s. In fine, a general &s;implicity of manners, an open and un|affected frankne&s;s, together with an invincible &s;pirit of freedom, may ju&s;tly be mentioned in the number of tho&s;e peculiar qualities, which dignify the public character of the people, and di&s;tingui&s;h them with honour among the nations of Europe.</P>
<P>Learning is le&s;s generally diffu&s;ed among the catho|lic than the prote&s;tant &s;tates. But in both, a man of
<PB N="101" REF="031692_0101_0FEE0DCB0826BF08">
letters will find abundant opportunities of gratifying his re&s;earches and improving his knowledge. To the natural philo&s;opher, Swi&s;&s;erland will afford an inex|hau&s;tible &s;ource of entertainment and information, as well from the great variety of phy&s;ical curio&s;ities, &s;o plentifully &s;pread over the country, as from the con|&s;iderable number of per&s;ons eminently &s;killed in that branch of &s;cience. Indeed in every town, and almo&s;t in every village, the curious traveller will meet with collections worthy of his attention.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XVIII. OF FRANKFORT. A. D. 1775.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the remarkable things in Frankfort, the inns may be reckoned. Two in particular, the Empe|ror and the Read Hou&s;e, for cleanline&s;s, conveniency, and number of apartments, are &s;uperior to any I ever &s;aw on the continent, and vie with our mo&s;t magnifi|cent inns in England.</P>
<P>At the&s;e, as at all other inns in Germany, there is an ordinary, at which the &s;trangers may dine and &s;up. This is called the Table d'H&ocirc;te, from the cir|cum&s;tance of the landlord's &s;itting at the bottom of the table and carving the victuals. The &s;ame name
<PB N="102" REF="031692_0102_0FEE0DCC92FB92C8">
for an ordinary is &s;till retained in France, though the landlord does not &s;it at the table, which was the ca&s;e formerly in that country, and &s;till is the cu&s;tom in Ger|many.</P>
<P>There are no private lodgings to be had here as in London. Strangers, therefore, retain apartments at the inn during the whole time of their re&s;idence in any of the towns. And travellers of every denomination in this country, under the rank of &s;overeign prince&s;s, make no &s;cruple of eating occa&s;ionally at the table d'H&ocirc;te of the inn where they lodge, which cu&s;tom is univer&s;ally followed by &s;trangers from every country on the continent of Europe.</P>
<P>Many of our countrymen, however, who de&s;pi&s;e oeconomy, and hate the company of &s;trangers, prefer eating in their own apartments to the table d'H&ocirc;te, or any private table to which they may be invited.</P>
<P>It would be arrogance in any body to di&s;pute the right which every free born Engli&s;hman has to follow his own inclination in this particular. Yet when peo|ple wi&s;h to avoid the company of &s;trangers, it &s;trikes me, that they might indulge their fancy as completely at home as abroad; and while they continue in that humour, I cannot help thinking that they might &s;ave them&s;elves the inconveniency and expence of travelling.</P>
<P>The manners and genius of nations, it is true, are not to be learnt at inns; nor is the mo&s;t &s;elect compa|ny
<PB N="103" REF="031692_0103_0FEE0DCE1D357290">
to be found at public ordinaries; yet a per&s;on of ob&s;ervation, and who is fond of the &s;tudy of charac|ter, will &s;ometimes find in&s;truction and entertain|ment at both. He there &s;ees the inhabitants of the country on a le&s;s ceremonious footing than he can el&s;ewhere, and hears the remarks of travellers of ev|ery degree.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t care of a traveller certainly &s;hould be, to form an acquaintance and &s;ome degree of intimacy with the principal people in every place where he in|tends to re&s;ide;&mdash;to accept invitations to their family parties, and attend their &s;ocieties;&mdash;to entertain them at his apartments, when that can be conveniently done, and endeavour to acquire a ju&s;t notion of their gov|ernment, cu&s;toms, &s;entiments, and manner of living.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are fond of the &s;tudy of man, which, with all due deference to the philo&s;ophers who prefer that of bea&s;ts, birds and butterflies, is al&s;o a pardona|ble amu&s;ement, will mix occa&s;ionally with all degrees of people, and when not otherwi&s;e engaged, will not &s;cruple to take a &s;eat at the table d'H&ocirc;te. It is &s;aid, that low people are &s;ometimes to be found at the&s;e or|dinaries. This, to be &s;ure is a weighty objection; but then it &s;hould be remembered, that it is within the bounds of po&s;&s;ibility that men, even engaged in com|merce, may have liberal minds, and may be able to give as di&s;tinct accounts of what is worthy of ob&s;erva|tion,
<PB N="104" REF="031692_0104_0FEE0DD5DF66ECD8">
as if they had been as idle as people of the high|e&s;t fa&s;hion through the whole of their lives. A man mu&s;t have a very turgid idea of his own grandeur, if he cannot &s;ubmit, in a foreign country, to dine at ta|ble with a per&s;on of inferior rank, e&s;pecially as he will meet, at the &s;ame time, with others as equal, or &s;upe|rior rank to him&s;elf. For all etiquette of this nature is waved, even in Germany at the tables d'H&ocirc;tes.</P>
<P>A knowledge of the characters of men, as they appear varied in different &s;ituations and countries; the &s;tudy of humun nature, indeed, in all its forms and modifica|tions, is highly intere&s;ting to the mind, and worthy the attention of the greate&s;t man. This is not to be perfectly attained in courts and palaces. The inve&s;ti|gator of nature mu&s;t vi&s;it her in humbler life, and put him&s;elf on a level with the men whom he wi&s;hes to know.</P>
<P>It is generally found, that tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s real great|ne&s;s of mind, never he&s;itate to overleap the ob&s;tacles, and de&s;pi&s;e the forms, which may &s;tand in the way of their acquiring this u&s;eful knowledge.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t powerful of all arguments again&s;t entirely declining to appear at the public table of the inn, is, that in this country it is cu&s;tomary for the ladies them|&s;elves, when on a journey, to eat there; and my parti|ality for the table, d'H&ocirc;te may po&s;&s;ibly be owing in &s;ome degree to my having met at one of them, with
<PB N="105" REF="031692_0105_0FEE0DD76BB433B0">
two of the hand&s;ome&s;t women that I have &s;een &s;ince I have been in this country, which abounds in female beauty.</P>
<P>There is more expre&s;&s;ion in the countenances of French women; but the ladies in Germany have the advantage in the fairne&s;s of their &s;kin and the bloom of their complexion. They have a greater re&s;em|blance to Engli&s;h women than to French; yet they differ con&s;iderably from them both. I do not know how to give an idea of the various &s;hades of expre&s;|&s;ion, which, if I mi&s;take not, I can di&s;tingui&s;h in the features of the &s;ex in the&s;e three countries.</P>
<P>A hand&s;ome French woman, be&s;ides the ea&s;e of her manner, has commonly a look of cheerfulne&s;s and great vivacity. She appears willing to be acquainted with you, and &s;eems to expect that you &s;hould addre&s;s her.</P>
<P>The manner of an Engli&s;h woman is not &s;o devoid of re&s;traint; and a &s;tranger, e&s;pecially if he be a foreign|er, may ob&s;erve a look which borders on di&s;dain in her countenance. Even among the lovelie&s;t features, &s;ome|thing of a &s;ulky air often appears.</P>
<P>A German beauty, without the &s;mart air of the one or the re&s;erve of the other, has generally a more placid look than either.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XIX. OF THE QUEEN OF DENMARK. A. D. 1775.</HEAD>
<P>THE D&mdash;of H&mdash;having determined to pay his re&s;pects to the Queen of Denmark before he left Han|over, cho&s;e to make his vi&s;it while the Hereditary prince&s;s was with her &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>I accompanied him to Zell, and next day waited on the Count and Counte&s;s Dean, to let them know of the D&mdash;'s arrival, and to be informed when we could have the honour of being pre&s;ented to the Queen. They both belong to the prince&s;s of Brun&s;|wick's family, and while I was at breakfa&s;t with them, her royal highne&s;s entered the room, and gave me the information I wanted.</P>
<P>Before dinner I returned with the duke to the ca&s;tle, where we remained till late in the evening. There was a concert of mu&s;ic between dinner and &s;upper, and the queen &s;eemed in better &s;pirits than could have been expected.</P>
<P>Zell is a &s;mall town, without trade or manufactures; the hou&s;es are old, and of a mean appearance, yet the high courts of appeal for all the territories of the Elec|toral Hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick Lunenburg are held here.
<PB N="107" REF="031692_0107_0FEE0DDEAB655060">
The inhabitants derive their principal means of &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence from this circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>This town was &s;everely harra&s;&s;ed by the French army at the beginning of the late war, and was afterwards pillaged, in revenge for the &s;uppo&s;ed infraction of the treaty of Clo&s;ter-Seven. The Duke de Richlieu had his head quarters here, when Duke Ferdinand re a&s;|&s;embled the troops who had been di&s;armed and di&s;per&s;|ed immediately after that convention.</P>
<P>The ca&s;tle is a &s;tately building, &s;urrounded by a moat, and &s;trongly fortified. It was formerly the re&s;i|dence of the Dukes of Zell, and was lately repaired by order of the King of Great Britain, for the recep|tion of his unfortunate &s;i&s;ter. The apartments are &s;pacious and convenient, and now hand&s;omely furni&s;h|ed.</P>
<P>The officers of the court, the Queen's maids of honor, and other attendants, have a very genteel appearance; and retain the mo&s;t re&s;pectful attachment to their ill-fated mi&s;tre&s;s. The few days we remained at Zell were &s;pent entirely at court, where every thing &s;eemed to be arranged in the &s;tyle of the other &s;mall German courts, and nothing wanting to render the Queen's &s;ituation as comfortable as circum&s;tances would ad|mit; but by far her greate&s;t con&s;olation is the compa|ny and conver&s;ation of her &s;i&s;ter. Some degree of &s;a|tisfaction appears in her countenance, while the Prin|ce&s;s
<PB N="108" REF="031692_0108_0FEE0DE4F3550D60">
remains at Zell; but the moment &s;he goes away, the Queen, as we were informed, becomes a prey to dejection and de&s;pondency. The Prince&s;s exerts her|&s;elf to prevent this, and devotes to her &s;i&s;ter all the time &s;he can &s;pare from the duties &s;he ows to her own family. Unlike tho&s;e who take the fir&s;t pretext of breaking connections which can no longer be of ad|vantage, this humane Prince&s;s has di&s;played even more attachment to her &s;i&s;ter &s;ince her misfortunes, than &s;he ever did while the Queen was in the meridian of her pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>The youth, the agreeable countenance, and obliging manners of the Queen, have conciliated the minds of every one in this country. Though &s;he was in per|fect health, and appeared cheerful, yet, convinced that her gaiety was a&s;&s;umed, and the effect of a &s;trong ef|fort, I felt an impre&s;&s;ion of melancholy, which it was not in my power to overcome all the time we remained at Zell.</P>
<P>On the evening of our arrival at Hanover, we had the plea&s;ure of hearing Handel's Me&s;&s;iah performed. Some of the be&s;t company of this place were a&s;&s;em|bled on the occa&s;ion, and we were here made acquaint|ed with old Field-Mar&s;hal Sporken, and other people of di&s;tinction.

and the Engli&s;h manners and cu&s;toms gain ground ev|ery day among the inhabitants. The genial influence of freedom has extended from England to this place. Tyranny is not felt, and ea&s;e and &s;atisfaction appear in the countenances of the citizens.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XX. ON THE PALACE AT POTSDAM, AND THE KING OF PRUSSIA. A. D. 1775.</HEAD>
<P>THE palace at Pot&s;dam, or what they call the ca&s;tle, is a very noble building, with magnificent gardens ad|jacent. I &s;hall not particularly de&s;cribe either; only it &s;truck me as a thing rather uncommon in a palace, to find the &s;tudy by far the fine&s;t apartment in it. The ornaments of this are of ma&s;&s;y &s;ilver. The writing-de&s;k, the embeli&s;hments of the table, and the accommo|dations of the books, were all in fine ta&s;te.</P>
<P>The per&s;on who attended us, a&s;ked if we had a de|&s;ire to &s;ee his Maje&s;ty's wardrobe? On being an&s;wer|ed in the affirmative, he conducted us to the chamber where the monarch's clothes are depo&s;ited. The whole wardrobe con&s;i&s;ted of two blue coats faced with red, the lining of one a little torn;&mdash;two yellowi&s;h wai&s;t;
<PB N="110" REF="031692_0110_0FEE0DE80D568148">
coats, a good deal &s;oiled with Spani&s;h Snuff;&mdash;three pair of yellow breeches, and a &s;uit of blue velvet, embroidered with &s;ilver, for grand occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>I imagined at fir&s;t, that the man had got a few of the King's old clothes, and kept them here to amu&s;e &s;trangers. But, upon enquiry, I was a&s;&s;ured, that what I have mentioned, with two &s;uits of uniform which he has at Sans-Souci, from the entire wardrobe of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. Our attendant &s;aid he had never known it more complete. As for the velvet &s;uit, it was about ten years of age, and &s;till enjoyed all the vigour of youth. Indeed, if the moths &s;pared it as much as his Maje&s;ty has done, it may la&s;t the age of Methu&s;alem.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame room are &s;ome &s;tandards belonging to the cavalry. In&s;tead of the u&s;ual &s;quare flag, two or three of the&s;e have the figures of eagles in carved &s;il|ver, fixed on a pole.</P>
<P>In the bed-chamber where the late King died, at the lower part of the window which looks into the garden, four p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">anes have been removed, and a piece of gla&s;s, equal in &s;ize to all the four, &s;upplies their place. We were informed that his late Maje&s;ty's &s;upreme de|light through life had been to &s;ee his troops exerci&s;e, and that he had retained this pa&s;&s;ion till his late breath. When he was confined to his room by his la&s;t illne&s;s, he u&s;ed to &s;it and view them through the window,
<PB N="111" REF="031692_0111_0FEE0DEDA9758680">
which had been framed in this manner, that he might enjoy the&s;e dying contemplations with the greater con|veniency. Becoming gradually weaker by the increa&s;|ing di&s;temper, he could not &s;it, but was obliged to lie on a couch through the day. When at any time he was uncommonly languid, they rai&s;ed his head to the window, and a &s;ight of the men under arms was per|ceived to operate like a cordial, and revive his &s;pirits. By frequent repetition, however, even this cordial lo&s;t its effect. His eyes became dim; when his head was rai&s;ed, he could no longer perceive the &s;oldiers, and he expired.</P>
<P>This was feeling the ruling pa&s;&s;ion as &s;trong in death as any man ever felt it.</P>
<P>When we arrived at Pot&s;dam, there was nothing I was &s;o eager to &s;ee, as the Pru&s;&s;ian troops at their ex|erci&s;e; but the frequent reviews have completely &s;ati|ated my curio&s;ity. And though the gardens of the palace are ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to the windows of our inn, I hardly ever go to look at the guards, who parade there every morning. A few days ago, however, I happen|ed to take a very early walk about a mile out of town, and &s;eeing &s;ome &s;oldiers under arms, in a field at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the road, I went towards them. An offi|cer on hor&s;eback, whom I took to be the Major, for he gave the word of command, was uncommonly ac|tive, and often rode among the ranks to reprimand, or
<PB N="112" REF="031692_0112_0FEE0DF2D5D04638">
in&s;truct the common men. When I came nearer, I was much &s;urpri&s;ed to find that this was the King him|&s;elf. He had his &s;word drawn and continued to ex|erci&s;e the corps for an hour after. He made them wheel, march, form the &s;quare, and fire by divi&s;ions, and in platoons, ob&s;erving all their motions with infi|nite attention; and, on account of &s;ome plunder, put two officers of the Prince of Pru&s;&s;ia's regiment under arre&s;t. In &s;hort, he &s;eemed to exert him&s;elf with all the &s;pirit of a young officer, eager to attract the notice of his General by uncommon alertne&s;s.</P>
<P>I expre&s;&s;ed my &s;urpri&s;e to an officer pre&s;ent, that the King was not willing to take &s;ome repo&s;e, particularly from that kind of employment of which he had had &s;o very much of late, and that he could take &s;o much pains with a mere handful of men, immediately after he had come from exerci&s;ing whole armies.</P>
<P>This gentleman told me, that on this particular day the King had been trying &s;ome new evolutions; but though this had not been the ca&s;e, he might very po&s;&s;i|bly have been in the field:&mdash;for his maxim was, that his troops &s;hould di&s;play as much bri&s;kne&s;s on a common field day, as if they were to engage in battle; and therefore it was never known when he intended to be pre&s;ent, or when not;&mdash;that as for repo&s;e, he took it between ten at night and four in the morning, and his other hours were all devoted to action, either of body
<PB N="113" REF="031692_0113_0FEE0DF460A80BE0">
or mind, or both; and that the exerci&s;e he had ju&s;t ta|ken, was probably by way of relaxation, after three hours previous labour in his cabinet.</P>
<P>The more I &s;ee and hear of this extraordinary man, the more am I a&s;toni&s;hed. He reconciles qualities which I u&s;ed to think incompatible. I once was of opinion, that the mind, which &s;toops to very &s;mall objects is incapable of embracing great ones. I am now convinced that he is an exception; for while few objects are too great for his genius, none &s;eem too &s;mall for his attention.</P>
<P>I once thought that a man of much vivacity was not capable of entering into the detail of bu&s;ine&s;s, I now &s;ee that he, who is certainly a man of wit, can continue methodically the nece&s;&s;ary routine of bu&s;i|ne&s;s, with the patience and per&s;everance of the great|e&s;t d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nce that ever drudged in a comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>We have lately &s;een the Italians perform; but nei|ther the plays, nor the operas, nor any part of the en|tertainments, intere&s;t me half &s;o much, or could draw me &s;o a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly to Sans-Souci, as the opportunity this attendance gives of &s;eeing the King. Other monarchs acquire importance from their &s;tation; this Prince gives importance to his. The traveller in other coun|tries has a wi&s;h to &s;ee the King, becau&s;e he admires the kingdom:&mdash;here the object of curio&s;ity is rever&s;|ed.

&mdash;And let us &s;uppo&s;e the palaces, and the towns, and the country, and the army of Pru&s;&s;ia ever &s;o fine, yet our chief intere&s;t in them will ari&s;e from their be|longing to Frederick the Second; the man who, with|out any ally but Britain, repelled the united force of Au&s;tria, France, Ru&s;&s;ia, and Sweden.</P>
<P>Count Ne&s;&s;elrode, talking with me on this &s;ubject, had an expre&s;&s;ion equally lively and ju&s;t:&mdash;"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is in adver&s;ity that he &s;hines; the more he is oppre&s;&s;ed the more irre&s;i&s;tible he becomes.</NOTE> C'e&s;t dans l'adver&s;it&eacute; qu'il brille, lor&s;qu'il e&s;t bien comprim&eacute; il a un re&s;&s;ort irr&eacute;&s;i&s;tible."</P>
<P>The evening of the day on which I had &s;een the King in the field, I was at Sans-Souci; for I wi&s;h to neglect no opportunity of being pre&s;ent where this monarch is. I like to &s;tand near him, to hear him &s;peak, and to ob&s;erve his movements, attitudes, and mo&s;t indifferent actions. He always behaves with par|ticular affability to the D&mdash;of H&mdash;. One evening, before the play began, his Grace and I were &s;tanding accidentally with Count Finken&s;tein, in a room adjoin|ing to the great apartment where the company were. The King entered alone, when he was not expected, and immediately began a conver&s;ation with the D&mdash;.</P>
<P>He a&s;ked &s;everal que&s;tions relating to the Briti&s;h con&s;titution; particularly at what age a Peer could
<PB N="115" REF="031692_0115_0FEE0DFCEAD72DA8">
take his &s;eat in parliament? When the Duke re|plied, "At twenty-one." It is evident from that, &s;aid the King, that the Engli&s;h patricians acquire the ne|ce&s;&s;ary talents for legi&s;lation much &s;ooner than tho&s;e of ancient Rome, who were not admitted into the &s;en|ate till the age of forty.</P>
<P>He then enquired about the &s;tate of Lord Chatham's health, and expre&s;&s;ed high e&s;teem for the character of that mini&s;ter. He a&s;ked me if I had received letters by the la&s;t po&s;t, and if they mentioned any thing of the affairs in America? He &s;aid there were accounts from Holland, that the Engli&s;h troops had been driv|en from Bo&s;ton, and that the Americans were in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of that place. I told him our letters informed us, that the army had left Bo&s;ton to make an attack with more effect el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>He &s;miled, and &s;aid,&mdash;If you will not allow the re|treat to have been an affair of nece&s;&s;ity, you will at+lea&s;t admit, that it was "<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quite apropos.</NOTE> tout-&aacute;-fait &aacute;-propos."</P>
<P>He &s;aid he heard that &s;ome Briti&s;h officers had gone into the American &s;ervice, and mentioned Colonel Lee, whom he had &s;een at his court. He ob&s;erved, that it was a difficult thing to govern-men by force at &s;uch a di&s;tance; that if the Americans &s;hould be beat (which appeared a little problematical), &s;till it would
<PB N="116" REF="031692_0116_0FEE0DFE753621A0">
be next to impo&s;&s;ible to continue to draw from them a revenue by taxation;&mdash;that if we intended concilia|tion with America, &s;ome of our mea&s;ures were too rough; and if we intended its &s;ubjection, they were too gentle. He concluded by &s;aying. "<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In &s;hort, Gentlemen, I do not under&s;tand the&s;e matters, I have no colonies, I hope you will extricate your&s;elves well out of trouble, but it appears to me a little difficult.</NOTE> Enfin, Me&s;&s;ieurs, je ne comprends pas ces cho&s;es l&aacute;; je n'ai point de co|lonie; j'e&s;p&egrave;re que vous vous tirerez bien d'affaire, mais elle me par&ograve;it un peu &eacute;pineu&s;e." Having &s;aid this, he walked into the Prince&s;s's apartment, to lead her to the play-hou&s;e, while we joined the company already a&s;&s;embled there. The tragedy of Mahomet was performed, which, in my opinion, is the fine&s;t of all Voltaire's dramatic pieces, and that in which Le Kain appears to the greate&s;t advantage.</P>
<P>As mo&s;t people are de&s;irous to be made acquainted with every thing which regards the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, I am perhaps, in danger of lengthening my de&s;criptions with a tedious minutene&s;s. I do not, however, pre|tend to draw a complete portrait of this monarch. That mu&s;t be the work of much abler painters, who have &s;een him in a more familiar, manner and who&s;e colours can give an expre&s;&s;ion worthy of the original. I &s;hall only attempt to give a faithful &s;ketch of &s;uch features as I was able to &s;eize during the tran&s;ient views I my|&s;elf
<PB N="117" REF="031692_0117_0FEE0E000429C3F0">
had, or which I have learnt from tho&s;e who have pa&s;&s;ed with him many of the hours, which he dedi|cates to free conver&s;ation and the plea&s;ures of the table.</P>
<P>The King of Pru&s;&s;ia is below the middle &s;ize, well made, and remarkably active for his time of life. He has become hardy by exerci&s;e and a laborious life; for his con&s;titution originally &s;eems to have been none of the &s;tronge&s;t. His look anounces &s;pirit and penetra|tion. He has fine blew eyes; and, in my opinion, his countenance upon the whole is agreeable. Some who have &s;een him are of a different opinion. All who judge from his portraits only, mu&s;t be &s;o; for although I have &s;een many, which have a little re&s;emblance of him, and &s;ome which have a great deal, yet none of them do him ju&s;tice. His features acquire a wonder|ful degree of animation, while he conver&s;es. This is entirely lo&s;t upon canvas.</P>
<P>He &s;toops con&s;iderably, and enclines his head almo&s;t con&s;tantly on one &s;ide.</P>
<P>His tone of voice is the cleare&s;t, and mo&s;t agreeable in conver&s;ation I ever heard.</P>
<P>He &s;peaks a great deal, yet tho&s;e who hear him re|gret that he does not &s;peak a great deal more. His ob|&s;ervations are always lively, very often ju&s;t, and few men po&s;&s;e&s;s the talent of repartee in greater perfection.</P>
<P>He hardly ever varies his dre&s;s, which con&s;i&s;ts of a blue coat, lined and faced with red, and a yellow
<PB N="118" REF="031692_0118_0FEE0E0711311B98">
wai&s;tcoat and breeches. He always wears boots, while hu&s;&s;ar tops, which fall in wrinkles about his ancles, and are oftener of a dark brown than a black colour.</P>
<P>His hat would be thought extravagantly large in England, though it is of the &s;ize commonly u&s;ed by the Pru&s;&s;ian officers of cavalry. He generally wears one of the large &s;ide corners over his forehead and eyes, and the front cock at one &s;ide.</P>
<P>He wears his hair cued behind, and dre&s;&s;ed with a &s;ingle buckle on each &s;ide. From their being very carele&s;sly put up and unequalled powdered, we may naturally conclude, that the fri&s;eur has been greatly hurried in the execution of his office.</P>
<P>He u&s;es a very large gold &s;nuff-box, the lid orna|mented with diamonds, and takes an immoderate quan|tity of Spani&s;h &s;nuff, the marks of which very often appear on his wai&s;tcoat and breeches. The&s;e are al&s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">able to be &s;oiled by the paws of two or three Italian grey hounds, which he often care&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>He dre&s;&s;es as &s;oon as he gets up in the morning. This takes up but a few minutes, and &s;erves for the whole day. It has often been &s;aid, that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's hours, from four or five in the morning till ten at night, are all dedicated methodically to particu|lar occupations, either of bu&s;ine&s;s or amu&s;ement. This is certainly true; and the arrangement has not &s;u&s;tain|ed
<PB N="119" REF="031692_0119_0FEE0E089BE96E78">
&s;uch an interruption for many years, as &s;ince the pre&s;ent company came to Pot&s;dam.</P>
<P>Some, who pretend to more than common pene|tration, a&s;&s;ert, that at pre&s;ent they can perceive marks of unea&s;ine&s;s in his countenance, and &s;eem convinced, that there will not be &s;uch another company at San&s;-Souci during his reign.</P>
<P>All bu&s;ine&s;s with the King is tran&s;acted by letters. Every petition or propo&s;al mu&s;t be made in this form, which is adhered to &s;o invariably, as I have been a&s;|&s;ured, that if any of his Generals wi&s;hed to promote a cadet to the rank of an en&s;ign, he would not venture to make his propo&s;al in any other manner, even though he had daily opportunities of conver&s;ing with his Ma|je&s;ty.</P>
<P>The meane&s;t of his &s;ubjects may apply to him in writing, and are &s;ure of an an&s;wer. His fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s every morning is the peru&s;ing the papers addre&s;&s;ed to him. A &s;ingle word written with his pencil on the margin, indicates the an&s;wer to be given, which is af|terwards made out in form by his &s;ecretaries. This method affords the King time to deliberate on the ju&s;t|ice and propriety of every demand, and prevents the po&s;&s;ibility of his being &s;urpri&s;ed into a promi&s;e, which it might be inconvenient to perform.</P>
<P>He &s;its down to dinner preci&s;ely at noon. Of &s;afe he allows more time to his repa&s;t than formerly. It is
<PB N="120" REF="031692_0120_0FEE0E0A290D3B48">
generally after three before he leaves the company. Eight or nine of his officers are commonly invited to dine with him. Since our coming to Pot&s;dam, Count Ne&s;&s;elrode, and the Abb&eacute; Ba&s;tiani, two men of letters, were the only company be&s;ides the officers, who dined with the King, while he lived in his u&s;ual way at the Old Palace of Sans-Souci; and the&s;e two were then of his party almo&s;t every day. The Count has now left this Court; the Abb&eacute; has an apartment in the Palace. He is an Italian by birth, a man of wit, and an excel|lent companion.</P>
<P>At table, the King likes that every per&s;on &s;hould ap|pear to be on a footing, and that the conver&s;ation &s;hould be carried on with perfect freedom. The thing, by the way, is impo&s;&s;ible. That confidential unre|&s;trained flow of the heart, which takes place in a &s;oci|ety of equals, is a plea&s;ure, which a de&s;potic Prince can never ta&s;te. However, his Maje&s;ty de&s;ires that it may be &s;o, and they make the be&s;t of it they can.</P>
<P>At one of the&s;e meetings, when the King was in a gay humour, he &s;aid to Ba&s;tiani,&mdash;When you &s;hould obtain the tiara, which your exemplary piety mu&s;t one day procure you, how will you receive me when I arrive at Rome to pay my duty to your Holine&s;s?&mdash;I will immediately give orders, replied the Abb&eacute;, with

<P>Nobody &s;ays more lively things in conver&s;ation than the King him&s;elf. Many of his bon mots are repeat|ed here. I &s;hall only mention one, which is at once an in&s;tance of his wit, and greatne&s;s of mind in ren|dering ju&s;tice to the merit of a man, who has cau&s;ed him more vexation than perhaps any other per&s;on a|live. When the King of Pru&s;&s;ia had a per&s;onal meet|ing &s;ome years &s;ince with the Emperor, they always dined together, a certain number of their principal officers being with them. One day General Laudohn was going to place him&s;elf at the bottom of the table, when the King, who was at the head, called to him, "<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Come, I intreat you, Mon&s;. Laudohn, &s;et here&mdash;I had much rather have you on my &s;ide than oppo&s;ed to me.</NOTE> Venez, je vous en prie, Mon&s;ieur Landhon, placez vous ici. J' aime infiniment mieux vous avoir de mon cot&egrave; que vis-&agrave;-vie."</P>
<P>Though all the cordiality of friend&s;hip, and the full charms of unre&s;erved &s;ociety, cannot exi&s;t, where the fortune of every other individual depends on the will of one of the company; yet the King endeavours to put every one as much at his ea&s;e as the nature of the
<PB N="122" REF="031692_0122_0FEE0E12CB328808">
will admit, and I have heard of his bearing &s;ome very &s;evere retorts with perfect good humour. He has too much wit him&s;elf, and is too fond of it in others, to re|pel its attacks with any other weapons than tho&s;e which it furni&s;hes. None but the mo&s;t ab&s;urd of dunces could attempt to ralley, without being able to allow of raillery; and only the meane&s;t of &s;ouls would think of revenging the liberties taken with a compa|nion by the power of a King.</P>
<P>A very &s;triking in&s;tance of the freedom which may be u&s;ed with him occured a little before the late re|views, and what makes it more remarkable, it happen|ed, not during the gaiety of the table, but on the very &s;cene of military &s;trictne&s;s.</P>
<P>Two regiments were in the field. That of General&mdash;was one of them. This officer is fond of com|pany, and pa&s;&s;es more of his time in the &s;ociety of &s;trangers, and with the foreign mini&s;ters, than mo&s;t others in the Pru&s;&s;ian &s;ervice. Something, it is proba|ble, had chagrined the King that morning. While the regiment advanced in a line, he &s;aid to the Gene|ral, who &s;tood near him, "<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Your regiment is not in a line Sir&mdash;and it is not &s;urpri|&s;ing, you devote &s;o much of your time to playing cards.</NOTE> Votre regiment n'e&s;t pas align&eacute; Mon&s;ieur&mdash;, et ce n'e&s;t pas &s;urprenant, vous jouez tant aux cartes." The General called out in&s;tantly with a loud voice to the regiment,<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Halt.</NOTE> Alte! and
<PB N="123" REF="031692_0123_0FEE0E14554530C0">
they immediately &s;topped. Then, turning to the King, he &s;aid, "<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">My cards' out of the que&s;tion, Sir. Have the goodne&s;s to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> if the regiment is not in a line.</NOTE> ll n'e&s;t pas que&s;tion, Sire, de mes cartes&mdash;Mais, ayez la bont&eacute; de regarder &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ce regiment n'e&s;t pas align&eacute;,"&mdash;The regiment was in a very &s;traightline, and the King moved away without &s;peaking, and &s;eemingly di&s;plea&s;ed, not with the General, but with him&s;elf. This manly officer never had rea&s;on after|wards to believe that the King had taken his freedom ami&s;s.</P>
<P>It is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible for any man to enjoy an office in the King of Pru&s;&s;ia's &s;ervice, without per|forming the duty of it. He is him&s;elf active and a&s;&s;i|duous, and he makes it a point that all his mini&s;ters and &s;ervants &s;hall be &s;o too. But to tho&s;e who know their bu&s;ine&s;s, and perform it exactly, he is an ea&s;y and equitable ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>A gentleman, who has been many years about his per&s;on, and is now one of his aid-de-camps, a&s;&s;ured me of this:&mdash;The King under&s;tands what ought to be done; and his &s;ervants are never expo&s;ed to the ridi|culous or contradictory orders of ignorance, or the mortifications of caprice.</P>
<P>His favourites, of whatever kind, never were able acquire influence over him in any thing regarding bu|&s;ine&s;s.
<PB N="124" REF="031692_0124_0FEE0E17B42F2950">
Nobody ever knew better how to di&s;crimi|nate the merit of tho&s;e who &s;erve him in the impor|tant departments of &s;tate, from theirs who contribute to his amu&s;ement. A man who performs the duties of his office with alertne&s;s and fidelity, has nothing to apprehend from the King's being fond of the compa|ny and conver&s;ation of his enemy. Let the one be regaled at the King's table every day, while the other never receives a &s;ingle invitation; yet the real merit of both is known; and if his adver&s;ary &s;hould ever try to turn the King's favour to the purpo&s;es of private hatred or malice, the attempt will be repelled with di&s;dain, and the evil he intended to another will fall on him&s;elf.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXI. OF THE HEREDITARY PRINCE OF PRUSSIA.</HEAD>
<P>THE Hereditary Prince of Pru&s;&s;ia lives in a &s;mall hou&s;e in the town of Pot&s;dam. His appointments do not admit of that degree of magnificence, which might be expected in the heir of the crown;&mdash;but he di&s;plays a &s;pirit of ho&s;pitality far more obliging than magnificence, and doubly meritorious, con&s;idering th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">
<PB N="125" REF="031692_0125_0FEE0E1EA23B59F8">
very moderate revenue allowed him. We generally &s;lip there two or three times a week.</P>
<P>The Prince is not often of the King's parties, nor is it imagined that he enjoys a great &s;hare of his uncle's favour. In what degree he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the talants of a general is not known, as he was too young to have any command during the late war. But he certainly has a very ju&s;t under&s;tanding, which has been improved by &s;tudy. He has taken &s;ome pains to acquire the En|gli&s;h language, to which he was enduced by an admi|ration of &s;everal Engli&s;h authors, who&s;e works he had read in French and German. He is now able to read Engli&s;h pro&s;e with tolerable facility, and has been of late &s;tudying Shake&s;pear, having actually read two or three of his plays.</P>
<P>I took the liberty to ob&s;erve, that as Shake&s;pear's ge|nius had traced every labyrinth, and penetrated into every rece&s;s of the human heart, his &s;entiments could not &s;ail to plea&s;e his Royal Highne&s;s; but as his lan|guage was uncommonly bold and figurative, and full of allu&s;ions to national cu&s;toms, and the manners of our i&s;land two centuries ago, the Engli&s;h them|&s;elves, who had not made a particular &s;tudy of his works, did not always comprehend their full en|ergy. I added, that to transfu&s;e the &s;oul of Shake|&s;pear into a tran&s;lation, was impo&s;&s;ible; and to ta&s;te all his beauties in the original, required &s;uch a know|ledge
<PB N="126" REF="031692_0126_0FEE0E202E56A7D8">
of the Engli&s;h manners and language, as few for|eigners, even after a long re&s;idence in the capital, could attain.</P>
<P>The Prince &s;aid he was aware of all this; yet he was determined to &s;truggle hard for &s;ome acquaintance with an author &s;o much admired by the Engli&s;h na|tion; that though he &s;hould never be able to ta&s;te all his excellencies, he was convinced he &s;hould under|&s;tand enough to recompence him for his trouble; that he had already &s;tudied &s;ome detached parts, which he thought &s;uperior to any thing he had ever met with in the works of any other poet.</P>
<P>His Royal Highne&s;s attends to military bu&s;ine&s;s, with as much a&s;&s;iduity as mo&s;t officers of the &s;ame rank in the army; for in the Pru&s;&s;ian &s;ervice, no de|gree of eminence in the article of birth can excu&s;e a remi&s;&s;ion in the duties of that profe&s;&s;ion. He is much e&s;teemed by the army, and con&s;idered as an exceeding good officer. To the frankne&s;s of a &s;oldier he joins the integrity of a German, and is beloved by the pub|lic in general, on account of his good nature, affabi|lity, and humane turn of mind.</P>

<P>THE Emperor is of a middle &s;ize, well made, and of a fair complexion. He has a con&s;iderable re&s;em|blance to his &s;i&s;ter, the Queen of France, which, in my opinion, is &s;aying a great deal in favour of his looks. Till I &s;aw &s;omething of his u&s;ual behaviour, I did not think it po&s;&s;ible for a per&s;on in &s;uch an ele|vated &s;ituation, to put every body with whom he con|ver&s;ed upon &s;o ea&s;y a footing.</P>
<P>His manner is affable, obliging, and perfectly free from the re&s;erved and lofty deportment a&s;&s;umed by &s;ome on account of high birth. Whoever has the honor to be in company with him, &s;o far from being checked by &s;uch de&s;picable pride, has need to be on his guard, not to adopt &s;uch a degree of familiarity as, whatever the condition of the one might permit, would be high|ly improper in the other to u&s;e.</P>
<P>He is regular in his way of life, moderate in his plea&s;ures, &s;teady in his plans, and diligent in bu&s;ine&s;s. He is fond of his army, and enclines that the &s;oldiers &s;hould have every comfort and nece&s;&s;ary con&s;i&s;tent with their &s;ituation. He is certainly an oeconomi&s;t, and lavi&s;hes very little mony on u&s;ele&s;s pomp, mi&s;tre&s;|&s;es, or favourites; and it is, I &s;uppo&s;e, on no better
<PB N="128" REF="031692_0128_0FEE0E29A4BBAFC0">
foundation than this, that his enemies accu&s;e him of avarice.</P>
<P>I cannot help regarding oeconomy as one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful qualities in a prince. Liberality, even when pu&s;hed to an imprudent length, may, in a private per|&s;on, proceed from a kind of greatne&s;s of mind, be|cau&s;e his fortune is in every &s;en&s;e his own, and he can injure no body but him&s;elf in lavi&s;hing it away. He knows that when it is gone, no body will reimbur&s;e him for his extravagance. He &s;eems, therefore to have taken the re&s;olution to &s;ubmit to the inconveniency of future poverty, rather than renounce the pre&s;ent hap|pine&s;s of acting with a magnificent liberality, and be|&s;towing on others more than he can afford.</P>
<P>This is not the ca&s;e with a prince. What he &s;quan|ders is not his own, but the public money. He knows that his pomp and &s;plendour will be kept up, and that his &s;ubjects, not him&s;elf, are to feel the inconvenien|cies of his prodigality. When I hear, therefore, that a king has given great &s;ums of money to any particular per&s;on; from the &s;ums given, the per&s;on who receives it, the motive for the gift, and other circum&s;tances, I can judge whether it is well or ill di&s;po&s;ed of; but in either ca&s;e, it cannot be called genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>The virtue of genero&s;ity con&s;i&s;ts in a man's depriv|ing him&s;elf of &s;omething for the &s;ake of another. There can be no genero&s;ity in giving to John what James
<PB N="129" REF="031692_0129_0FEE0E2B312FB878">
mu&s;t replace the next moment. What is called gene|ro&s;ity in kings, very often con&s;i&s;ts in be&s;towing that money on the idle part of their &s;ubjects which they have &s;queezed from the indu&s;trious. I have heard a parcel of fiddlers and opera dances prai&s;e a prince for his noble and generous behaviour to them, while men near his per&s;on, of u&s;eful talents and real worth, were di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for bread. The Emperor certainly has none of that kind of genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>His u&s;ual dre&s;s (the only one indeed in which I ever &s;aw him, except at the fea&s;t of the Knights of St. Ste|phen) is a plain uniform of white, faced with red. When he goes to Laxenberg, Schonbrun, and other places near Vienna, he generally drives two hor&s;es in an open chai&s;e, with a &s;ervant behind, and no other at|tendant of any kind. He very &s;eldom allows the guard to turn out, as he pa&s;&s;es through the gate. No body ever had a &s;tronger di&s;po&s;ition to judicious enquiry. He is fond of conver&s;ing with ingenious people. When he hears of any per&s;on, of whatever rank or country, being di&s;tingui&s;hed for any particular talent, he is ea|ger to conver&s;e with him, and turns the conver&s;ation to the &s;ubject on which the per&s;on is thought to excel, drawing from him all the u&s;eful information he can. Of all the means of knowledge, this is perhaps the mo&s;t powerful, and the mo&s;t proper that can be u&s;ed by one
<PB N="130" REF="031692_0130_0FEE0E2CC0CF4680">
who&s;e more nece&s;&s;ary occupations do not leave him much time for &s;tudy.</P>
<P>He &s;eems to be of opinion, that the vanity and ig|norance of many princes are frequently owing to the forms in which they are entrenched, and to their being deprived of the advantages which the re&s;t of mankind enjoy from a free compari&s;on and exchange of &s;enti|ment. He is convinced, that unle&s;s a king can con|trive to live in &s;ome &s;ocieties on a footing of equality, and can weigh his own merit, without throwing his guards and pomp into the &s;cale, it will be difficult for him to know either the world or him&s;elf.</P>
<P>One evening at the Counte&s;s Wal&s;tein's, the con|ver&s;ation leading that way, the Emperor enumerated &s;ome remarkable and ludicrous in&s;tances of the incon|veniences of etiquette, which had occurred at a cer|tain court. One per&s;on hinted at the effectual means his Maje&s;ty had u&s;ed to bani&s;h every inconveniency of that kind from the court of Vienna; to which he re|plied, it would be hard indeed, if, becau&s;e I have the ill fortune to be an Emperor, I &s;hould be deprived of the plea&s;ures of &s;ocial life, which are &s;o much to my ta&s;te. All the grimace, and parade to which people in my &s;ituation are accu&s;tomed from their cradle, have not made me &s;o vain, as to imagine that I am in any e&s;&s;ential quality &s;uperior to other men; and if I had any tendancy to &s;uch an opinion, the &s;ure&s;t way to
<PB N="131" REF="031692_0131_0FEE0E33B73A5DE0">
get rid of it is the method I take of mixing in &s;ociety, where I have daily occa&s;ions of finding my&s;elf inferi|or in talents to tho&s;e I meet with. Con&s;cious of this, it would afford me no enjoyment to a&s;&s;ume airs of a &s;uperiority, which I feel does not exi&s;t. I endeavour therefore to plea&s;e, and to be plea&s;ed; and as much as the inconveniency of my &s;ituation will permit, to enjoy the ble&s;&s;ings of &s;ociety like other men, convinced that the man who is &s;ecluded from tho&s;e, and rai&s;es him|&s;elf above friend&s;hip, is al&s;o rai&s;ed above happine&s;s, and deprived of the means of acquiring knowledge.</P>
<P>This kind of language is not uncommon with poor philo&s;ophers; but I imagine it is rarely held by prin|ces, and the inferences to be drawn from it more rare|ly put in practice.</P>
<P>A few days after this, there was an exhibition of fire|works on the Prater. This is a large park, planted with wood, and &s;urrounded by the Danube, over which there is a wooden bridge. No carriages being allowed to pa&s;s, the company leave their coaches at one end, and walk. There is a narrow path railed off on one &s;ide of the bridge. Many people very injudi|ciou&s;ly took this path, to which there is an ea&s;y en|trance at one end, but the exit is difficult at the oth|er; for only one per&s;on can go out at a time. The path, therefore, was very &s;oon choaked up; the unfor|tunate pa&s;&s;engers crept on a &s;nail's pace, and in the
<PB N="132" REF="031692_0132_0FEE0E35472262B0">
mo&s;t &s;traitened and di&s;agreeable manner imaginable; whil&s;t tho&s;e who had kept the wide path in the middle of the bridge, like the fortunate and wealthy in their journey through life, moved along at their ea&s;e, total|ly regardle&s;s of the wretched circum&s;tances of their fel|low pa&s;&s;engers.</P>
<P>Some few of the pri&s;oners in the narrow pa&s;&s;age, who were of a &s;mall &s;ize and uncommon addre&s;s, crawled under the rail, and got into the broad walk in the mid|dle, but all who were tall, and of a larger make, were obliged to remain and &s;ubmit to their fate. An En|gli&s;hman, who had been at the Counte&s;s Wal&s;tein's when the Emperor expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf as above men|tioned, was of the la&s;t cla&s;s. The Emperor, as he pa&s;&s;ed, &s;eeing that tho&s;e of a &s;mall &s;ize extricated them&s;elves, while the Engli&s;hman remained fixed in a very awk|ward &s;ituation, called out, "<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ah Sir! I have told you how inconvenient it is to be too great&mdash;now you will be entirely of my opinion, but as it is not in my power to afford you any relief, I recommend you to St. George.</NOTE> Ah, Mon&s;ieur!

<P>There are people who having heard of the Empe|ror's

uncommon affibility, and of his total contempt of pomp and parade, of which the bulk of mankind are &s;o much enamoured, have a&s;&s;erted that the whole is af|fectation. But if the whole tenor of any per&s;on's words is to be con&s;idered as affectation, I do not know by what means we are to get at the bottom of his real character. Yet, people who have a violent ta&s;te for any particular thing, are extremely ready to believe, that tho&s;e who have not the &s;ame ta&s;te are affected.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXIII. OF THE IDOLATRY OF THE ROMAN CATHOLICS.</HEAD>
<P>THE preference which is given by individuals in Roman Catholic countries, to particular &s;aints, pro|ceeds &s;ometimes from a &s;uppo&s;ed connection between the characters of the &s;aints and the votaries; men ex|pect the greate&s;t favour and indulgence from tho&s;e who mo&s;t re&s;emble them&s;elves, and naturally admire others for the qualities which they value mo&s;t in their own character.</P>
<P>A French officer of dragoons, being at Rome, went to view the famous &s;tatue of Mo&s;es, by Michael An|gelo.
<PB N="134" REF="031692_0134_0FEE0E3C209FF978">
The arti&s;t has conveyed into this ma&s;ter-piece, in the opinion of &s;ome, all the dignity which a hu|man form and human features are capable of receiv|ing. He has endeavoured to give this &s;tatue a coun|tenance worthy of the great legi&s;lator of the Jews, the favorite of heaven, who had conver&s;ed face to face with the Deity. The officer happened to be acquaint|ed with the hi&s;tory of Mo&s;es, but he laid no great &s;tre&s;s on any of the&s;e circum&s;tances. He admired him much more on account of one adventure, in which he imag|ined Mo&s;es had acquitted him&s;elf like a man of &s;pirit, and as he him&s;elf would have done:&mdash;"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">How terrible! how &s;ublime he appears. There is a fel|low who has cudgelled and killed his man in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE> Voli&agrave; qui e&s;t terrible! voli&agrave; qui e&s;t &s;ublime!" cried he at &s;ight of the &s;tatute; and after a little pau&s;e he added:&mdash;'On voit l&agrave; un dr&ocirc;le qui a donn&eacute; des coups de b&acirc;ton en &s;on tems, et qui a tu&eacute; &s;on homme."</P>
<P>The crucifixes, and &s;tatues, and pictures of &s;aints, with which popi&s;h churches are filled, were no doubt intend|ed to awaken devotion when it became drow&s;y, and to excite in the mind gratitude and veneration for the ho|ly per&s;ons they pre&s;ent. But it cannot be denied, that the gro&s;s imaginations of the generality of mankind, are exceedingly prone to forget the originals, and transfer their adoration to the &s;en&s;ele&s;s figures which they behold,
<PB N="135" REF="031692_0135_0FEE0E4249B0F118">
and before which they kneel. So that whatever was the original de&s;ign, and whatever effects tho&s;e &s;tatues and pictures have on the minds of calm, &s;en&s;ible Roman Catholics, it is certain, that they often are the objects of as complete idolatry as ever was practi&s;ed in Athens or Rome, before the &s;tatues of Jupiter or Apollo.</P>
<P>On what other principle do &s;uch multitudes flock from all the Roman Catholic countries in Europe, to the &s;hrine of our Lady at Loretto? Any &s;tatue of the Virgin would &s;erve as effectually as that to recal her to the memory; and people may adore her as devoutly in their own pari&s;h churches, as in the chapel at Lo|retto. The pilgrims therefore mu&s;t be per&s;uaded, that there is &s;ome divine influence or intelligence in the &s;tatue which is kept there; that it has a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of all the trouble they have taken, and the inconveni|encies to which they have been expo&s;ed, by long jour|nies, for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of kneeling before it in pre|ference to all other images.</P>
<P>It was probably on account of this tendency of the human mind, that the Jews were forbid to make unto them&s;elves any graven image. This indeed &s;eems to have been the only method of &s;ecuring that &s;uper&s;ti|tious people from idolatry; and notwith&s;tanding the peremptory tenor of the commandment, neither the zeal nor remon&s;trances of their judges and prophets could always prevent their making idols, nor hinder
<PB N="136" REF="031692_0136_0FEE0E43D50729D8">
their wor&s;hipping them wherever they found them rea|dy-made.</P>
<P>Statues and pictures of &s;aints, which have been long in particular families, are generally kept with great care and attention. The proprietors often have the &s;ame kind of attachment to them, that the ancient heathens had to their Dii Penates. They are con&s;idered as tu|telary and dome&s;tic divinities, from whom the family expect protection. When a &s;eries of unfortunate e|vents happens in a family, it &s;ometimes creates a &s;u&s;|picion that the family &s;tatues have lo&s;t their influence. This al&s;o is a very ancient &s;entiment. Suetonius in|forms us, that the fleet of Augu&s;tus having been di&s;|per&s;ed by a &s;torm, and many of the &s;hips lo&s;t, the Em|peror gave orders that the &s;tatue of Neptune &s;hould not be carried in proce&s;&s;ion with tho&s;e of the other Gods, from an opinion that the God of the Sea was unwil|ling or unable to protect his navy, and in either ca&s;e he deemed him not worthy of any public mark of di&s;|tinction.</P>
<P>The genuine tenets of the Roman Catholic church certainly do not authori&s;e any of the &s;uper&s;titions above mentioned, which are generally confined to the credu|lous and illiterate in the lower ranks of life. Yet in|&s;tances are &s;ometimes to be met with in a higher &s;phere. A Frenchman in a creditable way of life, had a &s;mall figure of our Saviour on the cro&s;s, of very curious

workman&s;hip; he offered it for &s;ale to an Engli&s;h gen|tleman of my acquaintance; after expatiating on the excellency of the workman&s;hip, he told him he had long kept this crucifix with the mo&s;t pious care; that he had always addre&s;&s;ed it in his private devotion, and that in return he had expected &s;ome degree of protec|tion and favour; in&s;tead of which he had of late been remarkably unfortunate; that all the tickets he had in the lottery had proved blanks; and having had a great &s;hare in the cargo of a &s;hip coming from the We&s;t In|dies, he had recommended it in the mo&s;t fervent man|ner in his prayers to the crucifix, and that he might give no offence, by any appearance of want of faith, he had not in&s;ured the goods; notwith&s;tanding all which, the ve&s;&s;el had been &s;hipwrecked, and the cargo totally lo&s;t, though the &s;ailors, in who&s;e pre&s;ervation he had no concern, had been all &s;aved. "Enfin, Mon|&s;ieur," cried he, with an accent of indignation mingled with regret, and rai&s;ing his &s;houlders above his ears, "<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">In &s;hort, Sir, I am in want, and mu&s;t &s;ee my God.</NOTE> Enfin, Mon&s;ieur, il m'a manqu&eacute;, et je vends mon Chri&s;t."</P>
<P>Happy for Chri&s;tians of every denomination, could they abide by the plain, rational, benevolent precepts of the chri&s;tian religion, rejecting all the conceits of &s;uper&s;tition, which never fail to deform its original beauty, and to corrupt its intrin&s;ic purity!</P>

<P>I FIND hardly any inconveniency re&s;ulting from my ignorance of the Dani&s;h language. Every per&s;on of fa&s;hion &s;peaks French, and many of them Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>The gentlemen of the army and navy here in parti|cular, are almo&s;t univer&s;ally u&s;ed to the&s;e languages. They are, at lea&s;t &s;everal of them with whom I have fallen into company, extremely di&s;po&s;ed to treat a &s;tranger with every mark of urbanity and politene&s;s. One of them has already promi&s;ed to accompany me over the i&s;land of Zealand, and to be my conducter on a tour I propo&s;e making to &s;ee the royal palaces.</P>
<P>Though the month of May will begin in a few days, the weather is &s;till very cold here. We have had hail almo&s;t every day &s;ince my arrival; nor are there as yet any marks of that &s;weet &s;ea&s;on, which the Italians &s;o ju&s;tly denominate, the <HI>Gioventa del anno,</HI> but which is pretty much unknown to Dani&s;h poets. Indeed, I apprehend the year is more properly divided here into the &s;ummer and winter, than as with us into four &s;ea|&s;ons. A &s;hort &s;ummer &s;ucceeds to the long &s;eries of cold and darkne&s;s, which environs them from October till April; and during this period, they often experi|ence very great heats for a few days, or &s;ometimes
<PB N="139" REF="031692_0139_0FEE0E4FDE159578">
weeks. Certainly man is much affected by phy&s;ical cau&s;es, and one is not &s;urpri&s;ed to find the elegant arts chiefly confined to luxurious and &s;outhern climates, and faintly rai&s;ing their heads amid the&s;e &s;nowy and inho&s;pitable regions, where the inhabitants &s;eem, in &s;ome degree, to partake of the a&s;perities of their &s;oil, and where royal munificence, however unbounded, can only rai&s;e a few &s;ickly and &s;traggling plants.</P>
<P>They &s;eem to have a great turn for politics here, and as it may not be quite &s;o &s;afe to in&s;pect too deep|ly into the conduct of their own &s;overeign and &s;tate&s;|men, they make them&s;elves &s;ome amends by intere&s;ting them&s;elves in tho&s;e of the Engli&s;h nation. I am a&s;ked a thou&s;and que&s;tions here, in every company, about the inhabitants of Bo&s;ton, and relative to the Ea&s;t In|dia affairs. They are unanimous in opinion, that the colonies will be &s;oon ab&s;olutely free; and they give me a look of incredibility, and a &s;ignificant &s;hake of the head, when I a&s;&s;ure them, that Bo&s;ton mu&s;t &s;ubmit, and that government have uniformly embraced the mo&s;t gentle, mild, and parental mea&s;ures; I &s;ee they do not believe me, and I am obliged to refer them to futurity for the te&s;t of my a&s;&s;ertions.</P>
<P>So few per&s;ons vi&s;it this metropolis or kingdom from motives of curio&s;ity, that they are quite &s;urpri&s;ed when I a&s;&s;ure them I have no &s;ort of bu&s;ine&s;s here, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> only employed in the &s;earch of knowledge. Indeed,
<PB N="140" REF="031692_0140_0FEE0E51699F49E8">
apprehend, a month or five weeks is fully adequate to the completion of the&s;e purpo&s;es; and I &s;hall not delay my departure an hour after that time.</P>
<P>There is no face of indu&s;try or bu&s;ine&s;s here; and Copenhagen, though one of the fine&s;t ports in the world, can boa&s;t of little commerce. The public pla|ces are filled with officers either in the land or &s;ea &s;er|vice, and they appear to con&s;titute three-fourths of the audience at the comedy and opera. The number of forces are, indeed, much too large for this little kingdom, which has not been engaged in war the&s;e fifty years. They can boa&s;t, 'tis true, a va&s;t extent of dominion; but of what importance are the barren and almo&s;t uninhabited mountains of Norway and Lap|land, &s;tretching to the pole? or the plains of Iceland, where the inhabitants are yet, and will probably ever remain, in the mo&s;t profound barbari&s;m? Their Ger|man dominions in Hol&s;tein are by far the mo&s;t rich, and furni&s;h a large part of the royal revenue. There needs, indeed, no &s;tronger proof of the poverty of the kingdom, than the &s;carcity of &s;pecie. I have &s;een no gold, and hardly any &s;ilver. They pay every thing in paper; and if you lo&s;e a &s;ingle dollar at the card-table, or the billiard table, it is given in a bill. I received two hundred rix dollars ye&s;terday morning, and not a &s;in|gle one in money.</P>
<P>The police of Copenhagen is exceedingly good, and
<PB N="141" REF="031692_0141_0FEE0E52F49424E0">
one may walk through the whole city at midnight with the mo&s;t perfect &s;afety. No robberies, no a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;inations are beard of. They wear no cloaks nor con|ceal any &s;tillettoes under their habits, as in the &s;outh|ern kingdoms of Europe. Indeed, it is u&s;ually almo&s;t as quiet here at eleven o'clock at night as in a coun|try village, and &s;carce a coach rattles through the &s;treets.</P>
<P>I do not apprehend this capital can be above the fourth part of the &s;ize of London, po&s;&s;ibly not &s;o much. It is fortified towards the land by a fo&s;s&egrave;, al|ways full of water. The &s;treets are commonly of a good breadth, and the hou&s;es very neat and hand&s;ome. There is one very beautiful place here, which ap|proaches nearer to a circus than a &s;quare; each &s;ide or divi&s;ion of which is only one palace, and in the cen|tre is an eque&s;trian &s;tatue in bronze of the late King Fredeick V. I mu&s;t own I was much more plea&s;ed with this, than with the Place de Victories at Paris, and think it has a much better effect.</P>

<P>I HAVE not had the honour of being pre&s;ented to the &s;overeign here, as is cu&s;tomary with &s;trangers from the other kingdoms of Europe. It is &s;ufficient that I am an Engli&s;hman not to wi&s;h it; and, indeed, with &s;o jealous an eye are we regarded, at pre&s;ent, in this capital, that I can a&s;&s;ure you, becau&s;e I have it from the mo&s;t re&s;pectable and inconte&s;table authority, that &s;o little an individual as my&s;elf, &s;o humble and un|known a traveller as I am, is not only publickly talk|ed of, but even &s;u&s;pected as a &s;py, becau&s;e I came from England, and have no avowed motive, except curio&s;ity and knowledge. I have never, therefore, been at the levee, which is every Friday; but I go to the drawing room, and mingle unnoticed among the crowd. I was there la&s;t night, when his maje&s;ty, the queen dowager, and Prince Frederick the king's brother, were pre&s;ent. To give you a picture of the court as it now exi&s;ts, I mu&s;t carry you back to the time of the late celebrated and unhappy favourite, Count Struen&s;ee.

Fortune, and a train of peculiar circum&s;tances, coinciding with his own talents and addre&s;s, &s;eem to have drawn him from his native mediocrity of condition, and placed him in an elevated rank. He originally practi&s;ed phy|&s;ic at Altena on the Elbe, and afterwards attended the pre&s;ent king of Denmark on his travels into England, in quality of phy&s;ician. On his return, he advanced by rapid &s;trides in the royal favour, and &s;eems to have eminently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the powers of plea&s;ing, &s;ince he became equally the favourite of both the king and queen. He was inve&s;ted with the order of St. Matilda, in&s;tituted in honour of her maje&s;ty, created a count, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed unlimited mini&s;terial power. His con|duct, in this &s;udden and uncommon eminence, marks a bold and daring mind; perhaps I might add, an ex|panded and patriotic heart. Unawed by the pre|carious

tenure of courtly greatne&s;s, and more peculi|arly of his own, he began a general reform. The &s;tate felt him through all her members. The finances, chan|cery, army, navy, nobles, pea&s;ants&mdash;all were &s;en&s;ible of his influence. He not only dictated, but penned his replies to every important que&s;tion or di&s;patch; and a petition, or a &s;cheme of public import and utility, rarely waited two hours for an an&s;wer. At pre&s;ent, I am told, you may be two months without receiving a|ny. The civil judicature of this capital was then ve&s;t|ed in thirty magi&s;trates. Struen&s;ee &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to this tribunal, demanding to know the annual &s;alary or pen&s;ion annexed to each member. Rather alarmed at this enquiry, they &s;ent an an&s;wer, in which they di|mini&s;hed their emoluments two thirds, and e&s;timated them at 1500, in&s;tead of 4000 rix-dollars. The count then informed them, that his maje&s;ty had no farther occa&s;ion for their &s;ervices; but in his royal munifi|cence and liberality, was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to contin|ue to them the third part of the avowed incomes, as a proof of his &s;atisfaction with their conduct. He at the &s;ame time con&s;tituted another court, compo&s;ed only of &s;ix per&s;ons of approved integrity, to whom the &s;ame power was delegated. He proceeded to purge the chancery, and other bodies of the law. Then enter|ing on the military department, he, at one &s;troke, broke all the hor&s;e-guards, and afterwards the regiment

of Norwegian foot-guards, the fine&s;t corps of the &s;er|vice, and who were not di&s;banded without a &s;hort, but very dangerous &s;edition. Still proceeding in this &s;alu|tary, but mo&s;t critical and perilous atchievement, he ultimately began to attempt a diminution of the power of the nobles, and to &s;et the farmers and pea&s;ants at perfect liberty. We mu&s;t not, therefore, wonder that he fell a victim to &s;uch mea&s;ures, and that all parties joined in his de&s;truction. The&s;e were his real crimes, and not that he was too acceptable to the queen, which only formed a pretext. It was the mini&s;ter, and not the man, who had became obnoxious. I do not pre|tend, in the latter capacity, either to excu&s;e or con|demn him; but as a politician, I rank him with the Clarendons and the Mores, whom tyranny, or public ba&s;ene&s;s, and want of virtue, have brought, in almo&s;t every age, to an untimely and ignominious exit; but to who&s;e memory impartial po&s;terity have done am|ple ju&s;tice. Yet I mu&s;t avow, that though I cannot think Struen&s;ee made a bad u&s;e, he certainly made a violent and imprudent one, of his exten&s;ive power. He &s;eems, if one may judge from his actions, to have been in &s;ome mea&s;ure intoxicated with royal favour and &s;uch accumulated honours, and not to have ad|verted &s;ufficiently to the examples which hi&s;tory fur|ni&s;hes of Wol&s;ey's in former days, and of Cho&s;euls in modern times who mo&s;t &s;trikingly evince the &s;lippery

foundation of political grandeur. When he was even pre&s;&s;ed only a &s;hort time before his &s;eizure, to with|draw from court, and pa&s;s the Belts, with the mo&s;t ample &s;ecurity for his annual remitment of forty, fifty, a hundred thou&s;and dollars, an unhappy fa&s;cination detained him, in defiance of every warning, and re&s;erv|ed him for the pri&s;on and the block. The Queen Dowager, and Prince Frederic, were only the feeble in&s;truments to produce this cata&s;trophe, as being by their rank immediately about the per&s;on of the &s;over|eign; though common report has talked loudly of the former's intrigue, and attributed it to her imaginary abilities. The only mark of capacity or addre&s;s they exhibited, was in pre&s;erving a &s;ecrecy, which deluded Struen&s;ee and the Queen Matilda, till the time of their being arre&s;ted. I have been a&s;&s;ured, that on the la&s;t levee day preceeding this event, the Count was habit|ed with uncommon magnificence, and never received greater homage of court &s;ervility from the crowd, than when on the verge of ruin. On the night fixed for his &s;eizure, there was a <HI>bal par&eacute;</HI> in the palace; the Queen, after dancing as u&s;ual, one country dance with the King, gave her hand to Struen&s;ee during the re&s;t of the evening. She retired about two in the morning, and was followed by him and Count Brandt. The mo|ment was now come. The Queen Dowager, and her &s;on Prince Frederic, ha&s;tened to the King's private
<PB N="147" REF="031692_0147_0FEE0E6DD5F02E30">
chamber, where he was already in bed. They kneed|ed down be&s;ide it, and implored him with tears and expo&s;tulations to &s;ave him&s;elf and Denmark from im|pending de&s;truction, by arre&s;ting tho&s;e whom they called the authors of it. 'Tis &s;aid, the King was no ea&s;ily induced to &s;ign the order, but did it with reluc|tance and he&s;itation. At length, their intreaties pre|vailed, and he fixed his &s;ign manuel to the paper. Co|lonel Koller Banner in&s;tantly repaired to Struen&s;ee's a|partment, which, as well as Brandt's, was in the palace they were both &s;eized nearly at the &s;ame in&s;tant, and, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> all defence was vain, hurried away immediately to the citadel. When Count Struen&s;ee &s;tepped out of the coach, he &s;aid with a &s;mile to the commandant, "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> believe you are not a little &s;urpri&s;ed at &s;eeing m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> brought here a pri&s;oner."

It was five o'clock in the morning when the Count Rantzau came to the door of her Maje&s;ty's anti-chamber, and knocked for admitance. One of the women about the Queen's per&s;on was ordered to wake her, and give her information that &s;he was ar|re&s;ted. They then put her into one of the King's coaches, drove her down to El&s;inoor, and &s;hut her up in the ca&s;tle of Cron&s;berg.</P>
<P>Mean while, as they dreaded an in&s;urrection in Co|penhagen
<PB N="148" REF="031692_0148_0FEE0E6F610E7A88">
every military precaution was taken to pre|vent it. The mo&s;t infamous and &s;illy reports were circulated among the populace, to render the &s;tate pri|&s;oners odious: that they had put poi&s;on in the king's coffee to de&s;troy him; that they intended to declare him incapable of governing; to &s;end the Dowager Queen Juliana out of the kingdom, as well as her &s;on Prince Frederic, and to proclaim Matilda regent. To confirm the&s;e extraordinary and contradictory reports, the King him&s;elf and he brother appeared in a &s;tate-coach, and paraded through the &s;treets of the city, to &s;how him&s;elf unhurt, and as if e&s;caped from the mo&s;t horrid con&s;piracy.</P>
<P>During the&s;e tran&s;actions, Struen&s;ee and Brandt were detained in the mo&s;t rigourous impri&s;onment. They loaded the former with very heavy chains about his arms and legs, and as he was at the &s;ame time fixed to the wall by an iron bar. I have &s;een the room, which is not above ten or twelve feet &s;quare, with a little bed in it, and a mi&s;erable iron &s;tove. Yet here, in this a|bode of mi&s;ery, did he, though chained, complete with a pencil an account of his life and conduct as a min|i&s;ter, which is penned as I have been a&s;&s;ured, with un|common genius. A tribunal was appointed for the tri|al of the Queen and the two Counts, and a council a&s;|&s;igned for each, to pre&s;erve an appearance of ju&s;tice and equity. All the world know the re&s;ult, and the
<PB N="149" REF="031692_0149_0FEE0E732C12D258">
winding up of the whole on the 28th of April, 1772. I &s;hall, however, mention &s;ome particulars relative to Count Brandt, as they are very remarkable and equal|ly true; nor do I apprehend that many in England have ever heard them.</P>
<P>This unfortunate man ro&s;e chiefly under Struen&s;ee's au&s;pices, though he was originally of an honourable de&s;cent. During a re&s;idence which the court made at one of the royal palaces, that of Herc&s;holm, it happen|ed that his Maje&s;ty quarrelled with Brandt, and, which was &s;ingular enough, challenged him. This the Count-declined. When they met &s;oon after, the King re|peated his defiance; called him coward; and Brandt &s;till behaving with temper, as became a &s;ubject, he thru&s;t his hand into his mouth, &s;eized his tongue, and had very nearly choaked him. In this &s;ituation can it be wondered at, that he &s;hould bite the King's fin|ger, or &s;trike him, or both? Self-pre&s;ervation mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;uper&s;ede every other feeling at &s;uch a mo|ment, and plead his pardon. By Struen&s;ee's mediation the quarrel was immediately made up, and the King promi&s;ed never more to remember or re&s;ent the cir|cum&s;tance of his &s;triking him. Yet was this blow, given to pre&s;erve him&s;elf from imminent de&s;truction, and from the fury of an enraged man, made the pre|tence for his condemnation. They &s;aid, he had li&s;ted his hand again&s;t the King's &s;acred per&s;on, which was
<PB N="150" REF="031692_0150_0FEE0E7852FAF2A0">
death by the laws of Denmark. His lawyer, I am told, made an excellent defence for him, and very forcibly remarked the e&s;&s;ential difference between a&s;&s;aulting the &s;overeign, and defending him&s;elf from a private attack. "One of our former monarchs, &s;aid he (Chri&s;tian V.) was u&s;ed frequently to unbend him&s;elf among his no|bles. On the&s;e occa&s;ions it was his cu&s;tom to &s;ay, "The King is not at home." All the courtiers then behaved with the utmo&s;t freedom and familiarity, un|re&s;trained by the royal pre&s;ence. When he cho&s;e to re&s;ume his kingly dignity, he &s;aid, "The King is again at home." But what, added he, mu&s;t we do now, when the King is never at home?" This &s;eems more like the &s;peech of an Engli&s;hman than a Dane, and breathes a manly and unfettered &s;pirit.</P>
<P>The &s;kulls and bones of the&s;e unhappy men are yet expo&s;ed on wheels about a mile and a half out of town. I have viewed them with mingled commi&s;eration and horror. They hold up an awful and affecting le&s;&s;on for future &s;tate&s;men.</P>
<P>I have been a&s;&s;ured, that Struen&s;ee re&s;igned him&s;elf to his own &s;entence without murmuring, or attempt|ing to deprecate the blow; but that he expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t pity and abhorrence at the flagrant inju&s;tice committed in &s;entencing Count Brandt to the &s;ame, death. They have portraits of Struen&s;ee in all the &s;hops, with this motto round him; "Mala multa Str<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|ens-&s;e
<PB N="151" REF="031692_0151_0FEE0E79DE001978">
ip&s;um perdidit." You &s;ee it is a mi&s;erable &s;ort of pun upon his name. Yet, in defiance of all the ca|lumnies of a triumphant party, the terrors of a de&s;po|tic government, and the natural re&s;erve among the people, there are, even here, who dare to &s;peak, though ambiguou&s;ly, their genuine &s;entiments. "Sir," &s;aid a man of &s;en&s;e and honour to me, a few days &s;ince, "between our&s;elves, all is not as it &s;hould be; we have at pre&s;ent neither king nor mini&s;ter. An imbe|cility mingled with di&s;order, characterizes our govern|ment. The effects are too vi&s;ible. The blue and white ribbons are pro&s;tituted and contemptible. The finances are in a wor&s;e &s;tate than when Struen&s;ee found them. The army devour us. In Norway, affairs are yet wor&s;e. The king is unpopular there, and &s;o lit|tle is his authority re&s;pected, that the Norwegians have refu&s;ed and &s;till refu&s;e, to pay the capitation tax; nor can it be levied among them." I have not amplified or exaggerated in this picture, which I really believe it too ju&s;t in mo&s;t of the particulars. The King has cer|tainly &s;uffered much in his intellectual capacity, and they make very little &s;cruple in general to own it. He can play indeed at cards; he can dance, or go to an op|era; but he is doubtle&s;s in a &s;tate of debility, which di&s;qualifies him for the conducting or &s;uperintending affairs of national import and public con&s;equence. The&s;e are left to the mini&s;ters, who tread very cautiou&s;|ly,
<PB N="152" REF="031692_0152_0FEE0E7F87B436B8">
and will not pre&s;ently pro&s;ecute Struen&s;ee's patri|otic mea&s;ures. His fall is too recent, nor have his bones yet returned to their parent earth. There is a vacuity in his a&s;pect, which is &s;trongly marked; and he is much paler and thinner than when he was on his tour in England. The Queen Dowager and Prince Frederic live in the palace with him, and accompany him, like his &s;hadow, wherever he moves. The Prince has received no other mark of bounty from nature, or fortune, than royal birth. He is very much deform|ed; and this per&s;onal imperfection has gained him the appellation of Richard III. among tho&s;e who do not love the court, though it doubtle&s;s originated among the Engli&s;h.</P>

<P>AS I approached to this capital, the country appear|ed more rocky, barren, and de&s;ert; and at the di&s;tance of a &s;ingle mile from it, one is tempted to &s;uppo&s;e one's-&s;elf in the mo&s;t unfrequented and de&s;olate wild.

<P>I entered Stockholm over a floating bridge of a very con&s;iderable length acro&s;s the river. I was, indeed, &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">opt at the gates; but policy, and not religion, was the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>I am lodged at pre&s;ent clo&s;e to the palace; and, as my landlord informs me, in the very apartment where his Grace the Archbi&s;hop of Up&s;al re&s;ided, during &s;ix months previous to the coronation of his pre&s;ent Ma|je&s;ty, which office he performed. You will perhaps &s;uppo&s;e from this, that they are very elegant; that the hangings are of tape&s;try, and the chairs covered with velvet. Nothing le&s;s &s;o, I a&s;&s;ure you! A monk of La Trappe might almo&s;t occupy them without any in|fringement of his vow of mortification; and though I pay a ducat and a half, or fourteen &s;hilling a week, I was &s;carce ever &s;o indifferently lodged in any city of Europe.

It would be difficult to di&s;cover any other to recommend them.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;ay that I have &s;ound many charms as yet in this city. The court are all in the country, at their re&s;pective palaces, and there is only one public diver|&s;ion during the week, which is a Swedi&s;h opera.

What kind of an entertainment this is, and how far the language is capable of mu&s;ical beauty, I am not yet a judge, as there was no repre&s;entation la&s;t Thur&s;day, which is the night when they u&s;ually perform. For want, therefore, of other avocation, I have wandered over every part of the metropolis, and taken different views of it from the numerous eminences which &s;ur|round it. Perhaps I may be accu&s;ed of pre&s;umption when I a&s;&s;ert, that in almo&s;t every point of view, the &s;ituation of Stockholm is injudicious and improper for the capital of the kingdom. Policy, plenty, and com|merce, &s;eem all to dictate another part of Sweden as much more elegible. I &s;hall endeavour to ju&s;tify my opinion by a few remarks.</P>
<P>The inhabitants them&s;elves a&s;&s;ure me, that the place owed its original, only about three centuries ago, to an accidental contingency. The viceroy, who at that time governed the country under Chri&s;tian II. of Denmark, determined to found a city, and in&s;tead of fixing on a proper &s;pot for the execution of his plan, he very wi&s;ely &s;et a large piece of wood a-float, down the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ler Lake, and re&s;olved that at whatever place it &s;hould &s;top, there to build his projected town. A &s;mall i&s;land arre&s;ted the &s;tick in its progre&s;s, and the name of Stockholm is &s;aid to have been given it from this circum&s;tance</P>
<P>I was &s;hown the exact point of land where tradition
<PB N="155" REF="031692_0155_0FEE0E89AAD750D0">
&s;ays it happened, and where the fir&s;t buildings of the city were erected. However this be, it was hardly po&s;&s;ible to have found a more barren de&s;ert, or a le&s;s inviting &s;ituation in almo&s;t all re&s;pects. Even the ri|ver has a number of inconveniencies, as it winds in a &s;urpri&s;ing manner, and having no tides, &s;hips mu&s;t have a fair wind to reach the town; and &s;hould it be con|trary, it is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible. If I pointed out that part of Sweden, which appears to me de&s;igned by nature and wi&s;dom for the foundation of a capital, I &s;hould mention Carl&s;crone. Its centrical &s;ituation between Copenhagen and Peter&s;burg; its vicinity to Pomerania and Germany; the fertile province of Scania, account|ed the fine&s;t in Sweden, behind it; a port capable of containing the whole fleet and in which they are at this time always &s;tationed; its climate, more mild and &s;outhern than that of Stockholm, by &s;ome degrees; all the&s;e circum&s;tances &s;eem to leave an unprejudiced per&s;on little room to di&s;pute its more advantageous &s;it|uation.</P>
<P>There is &s;omewhat uncommonly &s;avage and inho&s;|pitable in the whole circumjacent country here. Even in this lovely &s;ea&s;on, when all animate and inanimate nature awakes from the long &s;lumber of a polar winter, every thing is joyle&s;s and unfertile, and the rays of the &s;un are reflected from the expan&s;e of &s;tone which inve&s;ts the city round on every &s;ide; and from

I repeat in&s;tinctively, as I gaze around, the celebrated lines in Churchill's prophecy of Famine, which, how|ever exaggerated they may be for the country he inten|ded to paint, are almo&s;t &s;trictly and literally true here; nor am I &s;urpri&s;ed to find a Chri&s;tian flying from the&s;e uncivilized and unlettered regions, to the abodes of art and elegance.</P>
<P>This kingdom has however, been move productive of immortal and &s;ublime &s;pirits, than all the others of the north.

Mon&s;ieur Voltaire has taken great pains to prove the contrary, and to vindicate the engineer who ac|companied him, at the time, from &s;o foul a &s;u&s;picion. I, however, think his rea&s;ons very apocryphal, and even &s;ome of the facts he relates, as rather tending to give ri&s;e to an oppo&s;ite conclu&s;ion. "The King," &s;ays he, "walked out to view the &s;tate of the advances made by his forces; it was night. He kneeled down the better to in&s;pect them, and leaned his head on his hands. In this attitude, amid the darkne&s;s, he receiv|ed a ball into his temple, and fell on the parapet, fetch|ing a deep &s;igh. He was dead in an in&s;tant; but in that in&s;tant he had yet force and courage to put his hand to his &s;word, and lay in that po&s;ture. Merget, a French engineer, immediately &s;aid, with a coolne&s;s which di&s;tingui&s;hed his character.&mdash;The play is over, let us begone!" I quote by memory, and therefore a&s;k Voltaire's pardon if I do not exactly and literally relate it, as he has given it to the world; but nothing material is added or omitted.</P>
<P>The Swedes allow mo&s;t of the&s;e circum&s;tances to be true, though they infer very differently. Is it, &s;ay they, probable, that a ball from the fort, fired at ran|dom, and in the night, &s;hould &s;o exactly enter the King's brain? Or, is it not much more natural to be|lieve, that a pi&s;tol from &s;ome nearer hand gave &s;o well-aimed and deci&s;ive a blow? His attitude indicated an
<PB N="158" REF="031692_0158_0FEE0E94ADA38090">
intention of defence from &s;ome near attack; nor would he have laid his hand on his &s;word to re&s;i&s;t a cannon &s;hot.</P>
<P>Merget's remark was &s;uch, as one can with difficul|ty &s;uppo&s;e any one to make on &s;o di&s;a&s;trous and unex|pected an event, as the King's death, and &s;eems rather that of a pre-&s;entiment of the winding up of this bloody cata&s;trophe. Add to this, that the Swedes were tired of a prince, under whom they had lo&s;t their riche&s;t provinces, their brave&s;t troops, their national riches; and who yet, untamed by adver&s;ity, pur&s;ued an un&s;uc|ce&s;sful and pernicious war, nor would ever have li&s;ten|ed to the voice of peace, or con&s;ulted the internal tran|quility of his country. Baron Gortz's oppre&s;&s;ions, &s;uperadded to the&s;e, were intolerable; and no re&s;ource remained unle&s;s to di&s;patch the King. It was a very favourable opportunity, and was improved to the ut|mo&s;t. The Prince of He&s;&s;e, his brother-in-law, made little enquiry into the affair, and all pa&s;&s;ed without noi&s;e or tumult.</P>
<P>I have been the more inclined to give credit to this relation of Charles's death, from my own remarks on his dre&s;s. In the ar&s;enal they pre&s;erve with great care, the cloathes he was habited in at the time he fell. The&s;e I have examined very minutely.

in which hung his &s;word. The hat is torn only about an inch &s;quare in that part of it which lies over the temple, and certainly would have been much more injured by a large &s;hot. His gloves are made of very fine leather, and as the le&s;t one is perfectly clean and un&s;oiled, could only have been newly put on. The right hand glove is covered in the in&s;ide with blood; and the belt, at that part where the handle or hilt of his &s;word lay, is likewi&s;e bloody; &s;o that it &s;eems clear he had previou&s;ly put his hand to his head on receiv|ing the blow, before he attempted to draw his &s;word and make re&s;i&s;tance. However, as he expired in the in&s;tant, no ab&s;olute inference can be made; and after having exhau&s;ted conjecture, we mu&s;t draw a veil over this ambiguous and dark tran&s;action, and re&s;t content|ed with that ignorance and uncertainty which &s;o often waits on the death of &s;overeigns. Dr. John&s;on has drawn the mo&s;t fini&s;hed and ma&s;terly portrait of this extraordinary man, which ever fell from the pen of ge|nius. The four concluding lines de&s;cribes his death.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXVII. OF PETERSBURG, A. D. 1774.</HEAD>
<P>THIS great capital, though only a creation of the pre&s;ent century, has already grown to a va&s;t &s;ize, and con|tains infinitely higher matter of entertainment and in&s;truc|tion, than either of tho&s;e from whence I am lately come. I am &s;truck with a plea&s;ing a&s;toni&s;hment, while I wander among havens, &s;treets, and public buildings, which have ri&s;en as by inchantment, within the memory of men &s;till alive, and have converted the mar&s;hy i&s;lands of the Neva into one of the mo&s;t magnificent cities of the earth. The imagination, aided by &s;o many vi&s;ible objects, ri&s;es to the wondrous founder, and beholds in idea the tutelary genius of Peter, yet hovering over the child of his own production, and viewing with a par|ent's fondne&s;s, its ri&s;ing palaces and temples. The names, on which ancient &s;tory dwells with &s;o much fondne&s;s, &s;ink on a compari&s;on with this immortal man, and the fabulous legi&s;lators of Greece and Egypt nev|er pre&s;umed to attempt the mighty transformation which the Czar completed. The followers of Cadmus, of The&s;eus, and of Romulus, were animated with the &s;ame ardour as their leader; but the Mu&s;covites, wrapt in the mo&s;t profound barbari&s;m, &s;ecluded by their illiberal prejudices from an intercour&s;e with Eu|ropean

nations, and equally the &s;laves of &s;uper&s;tition and long pre&s;cription, were forcibly torn from this night of ignorance, and compelled to accept of know|ledge, of refinement, and of civilization. I mu&s;t own, I never con&s;ider this &s;o recent and &s;o wondrous an e|vent without being hurried away by an enthu&s;ia&s;m I cannot avoid feeling, and from which I now return, to give an imperfect de&s;cription of the fe&s;tivities to which I have been a witne&s;s during my &s;tay here, and from which I am only ju&s;t returned.</P>
<P>I had the plea&s;ure to accompany Sir Robert Gunn|ing la&s;t Saturday to the palace of Peterhoff, where the empre&s;s at pre&s;ent re&s;ides. It was the anniver&s;ary of her acce&s;&s;ion, when there is generally a very brilliant court. As we arrived early, I had an opportunity of viewing the gardens before her maje&s;ty's appearance. They are very exten&s;ive, lying along the &s;hore of the gulf of Finland, and wa&s;hed by its waters. In &s;he mid&s;t of them &s;tands the palace it&s;elf, &s;ituate on an em|inence, and commanding a fine view. The apart|ments are all very &s;plendid, but my attention was chiefly engro&s;&s;ed by the drawing-room, where hung five matchle&s;s portraits of the &s;overeigns of Ru&s;&s;ia. They are all length pieces, but by what ma&s;ter I can|not &s;ay. Peter him&s;elf is the fir&s;t, and oppo&s;ite to him appears the Livonian villager, whom he rai&s;ed from a cottage to the mo&s;t unbounded &s;overeignty. I &s;tood

for &s;ome moments under this painting in &s;ilent admi|ration of the woman, who had pa&s;&s;ed from &s;o humble a &s;tation to an imperial diadem, of which her genius, her fidelity, and her virtue made her worthy. She is drawn by the painter as in middle life; her eyes and hair black, her countenance open, &s;miling and ingratia|ting, and her per&s;on not exceeding the middle &s;ize. The Empre&s;s Anne and Elizabeth fill their re&s;pective places in this apartment, but did not long detain me from a portrait of the reigning &s;overeign, which is of a &s;ingular kind. She is habited in the Ru&s;&s;ian uniform, booted, and &s;its a&s;tride on a white hor&s;e. In her hat is the oaken bough, which &s;he wore at the memorable revolution, which placed her on the throne, and which was likewi&s;e taken by all her adherents. Her long hair floats in di&s;order down her back; and the flu&s;h|ing in her face, the natural effect of the fatigue and heat &s;he had undergone, is finely de&s;igned. It is a faithful and exact re&s;emblance of her dre&s;s and per&s;on, as &s;he appeared twelve years ago, when &s;he came to Peterhoff, and &s;eized the throne of Ru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>While my eyes were rivetted to this picture, and my thoughts employed on the melancholy cata&s;trophe of the unhappy emperor which &s;o &s;oon followed, the em|pre&s;s's entrance was announced. She was pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ceeded by a long train of lords and gentlemen. I felt a plea|&s;ure corrected with awe as I gazed on this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words">
<PB N="163" REF="031692_0163_0FEE0EA651BFDE78">
woman, who&s;e vigour and policy, without any right of blood, has &s;eated and maintains her in the throne of the Czars.</P>
<P>Though &s;he is now become rather corpulent, there is a dignity tempered with graciou&s;ne&s;s in her deport|ment and manner, which &s;trikingly impre&s;&s;es. She was habited in a deep blue &s;ilk with gold &s;tripes, and her hair ornamented with diamonds. After the for|eign mini&s;ters had paid her the cu&s;tomary compliments on this day, I had the honour to be pre&s;ented and to ki&s;s her hand. The grand duke and duche&s;s of Ru&s;|&s;ia followed the empre&s;s, who continued &s;carce a min|ute in the circle, but &s;at down at the card table.</P>
<P>There is not only a magnificence and regal pomp in this court, which far exceeds any I have beheld el&s;e|where, but every thing is on a va&s;t and colo&s;&s;al &s;cale, re&s;embling that of the empire it&s;elf. The public buil|dings, churches, mona&s;teries, and private palaces of the nobility, are of an immen&s;e &s;ize; and &s;eem as if de&s;igned for creatures of a &s;uperior heighth and di|men&s;ions to man; "to a puny infect &s;hivering at the breeze!"</P>
<P>The &s;tatue and pede&s;tal which will &s;oon be &s;et up of Peter the Great, are of the &s;ame enormous and gi|gantic proportions, and may almo&s;t rank with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">hynxes and pyramids of Egyptian workman&s;hip. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Mo&s;cow, I am told, this &s;tyle is yet more common,

and more univer&s;al. The palace which the pre&s;ent empre&s;s has begun, is de&s;igned to be two or three En|gli&s;h miles in circumference; and in the mean time they have erected a tempory one of brick for her recep|tion. The city it&s;elf is an immen&s;e aggregate of vil|lages, and the Mu&s;covite lords commonly go fifty or &s;ixty ver&s;ts which are at lea&s;t forty of our miles, to make vi&s;its to each other. There is a &s;ort of &s;avage and barbarous grandeur in this ta&s;te, which never ap|pears in the edifices and productions of Athenian &s;culpture or architecture. I know it may be &s;aid, that the difference of extent and greatne&s;s between the little republic of Attica, and the wide empire of Ru&s;&s;ia, may give ri&s;e to a different &s;tandard of beauty and elegance; but this is not &s;ufficient to alter the original and inva|riable criterion of nature, which is the &s;ame in every country.</P>
<P>Peter&s;burg is as yet only an immen&s;e outline, which will require future empre&s;&s;es, and almo&s;t future ages to complete. It &s;tands at pre&s;ent on a prodigious ex|tent of ground; but as the hou&s;es in many parts are not contiguous, and great &s;paces are left unbuilt, it is hard to a&s;certain its real &s;ize and magnitude. Devo|tion has not been wanting to add her magnificence, and to erect places of wor&s;hip in almo&s;t every part. Cu|rio&s;ity and novelty have carried me to all of them. The external architecture differs very little in any.

The Greeks &s;eem as fond of domes, as the Mahome|tans are of Minarets in their churches. They u&s;ually encircle one large with four &s;maller cupolas, and cov|er them with copper gilt, which has a fine effect to the eye, when the &s;un &s;hines upon it. The ornaments within are co&s;tly and barbarous. A Mexican temple can hardly be more &s;o. They &s;urround a daubing of the Virgin and Je&s;us, with gold or &s;ilver head-dre&s;&s;es, and &s;ometimes complete habits, and only leave expo&s;ed the fingers, which the multitude very devoutly ki&s;s. The papas or prie&s;ts are dre&s;&s;ed in ve&s;tments which ve|ry much re&s;emble the Romi&s;h, and are generally com|po&s;ed of ti&s;&s;ue and expen&s;ive &s;ilks. The manner in which they perform the &s;ervice rather reminds one of an incantation, than of a prayer offered to the Deity; and they repeat much of it &s;o incredibly fa&s;t, that one is tempted to &s;uppo&s;e it impo&s;&s;ible the auditory can under&s;tand one articulate word the prie&s;t utters, let their attention be ever &s;o &s;trong.</P>

plea&s;ure which the mind may experience from the con|templation of it. Only one monarch is excluded, as if unworthy to be entombed with his progenitors and predece&s;&s;ors in the throne of Ru&s;&s;ia. This is the late unhappy Peter III. who, after his death, was expo&s;ed during &s;ome days in the mona&s;tery of St. Alexander Newfsko;, a few miles out of town, to convince the people that he had not &s;uffered any violence, but end|ed his life naturally. He was afterwards privately in|terred there.&mdash;As I have mentioned his name, I am led to make a few remarks on his life and character. Though under the pre&s;ent reign it may be imagined, that few per&s;ons either dare or chu&s;e to &s;peak their &s;en|timents freely with re&s;pect to him, yet I am induced to believe from univer&s;al te&s;timony, that he was very unworthy and unfit to reign, and that whatever private condemnation the empre&s;s, as his wife, may undergo, it was a mo&s;t &s;alutary and requi&s;ite policy for Ru&s;&s;ia to depo&s;e him. He brought to Peter&s;burg all the illiberal and pernicious prejudices of a German; he avowed his open contempt for their religion, their manners, their laws; he was on the point of commencing a war with Denmark for the recovery of his Hol&s;tein dominions, and would have begun his march acro&s;s the immen&s;e track of country which &s;eparates the&s;e kingdoms in a few days; he had per&s;onally ill-treated and injured his wife, and alienated by his imprudence and folly every heart.
<PB N="167" REF="031692_0167_0FEE0EB0BB719B08">
The vigour and celerity with which the Empre&s;s acted in effecting the revolution, could only be exceeded by the pu&s;illanimity and meanne&s;s with which Peter re|&s;igned the crown. He was him&s;elf, on the day which preceeded this event, at the palace of Oranienbaum, and totally unprepared for &s;uch a change, of which he entertained no &s;u&s;picion. She departed from Peter|hoff, where &s;he then was, by a po&s;tern door in the gar|dens, very early in the morning, Prince Orloff con|ducting her in his coach, and reached Peter&s;burg be|fore her ab&s;ence was known. She in&s;tantly took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the palace without difficulty or oppo&s;ition, and putting her&s;elf in an uniform at the head of the guards, marched towards Peterhoff. As &s;oon as the Emperor received this intelligence, he embarked immediately from Oranienbaum, which is &s;ituate on the &s;hore of the gulf of Finland, in one of the imperial yachts, in hopes to reach con&s;tadt, which is nearly oppo&s;ite, and in the fortre&s;s of which he would have been &s;ecure. Here, however, he was di&s;appoint|ed, as the Empre&s;s had already anticipated his inten|tion, and di&s;patched two admirals, who &s;ecured it. When he came near the fortre&s;s, they ordered him to keep off, or they would &s;ink him, and at the &s;ame time pointed the guns for that purpo&s;e. Be&s;ides his mi&s;tre&s;s, the Counte&s;s of Voronzoff, he had a number of wo|men and attendants in the ve&s;&s;el with him. Terrified
<PB N="168" REF="031692_0168_0FEE0EB89CB53288">
with the appearance of oppo&s;ition, they knelt round him, and rent the air with their cries, to enduce him to relinqui&s;h his purpo&s;e: effectively he did &s;o, and yielding to his own fears, and their importunities, he had not the courage to attempt to land, but returned back to Oranienbaum. It proved afterwards that the&s;e guns were not loaded. The old Felt Marechal Count Munich, who had been newly recalled from his long exile in Siberia, was with him at this critical emergen|cy, and gave him the only advice which could po&s;&s;i|bly have &s;aved him. He implored him to go boldly and meet the empre&s;s, to charge the guards on their al|legiance to obey his orders as their &s;overeign, and of|fered to lo&s;e his own life in his defence. Peter had not &s;ufficient magnanimity and greatne&s;s of mind, either to perceive the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of this conduct, or to embrace it in&s;tantly. On the contrary, con&s;ulting only with his terrors, he threw him&s;elf on the ground before the empre&s;s, in the gardens Oranienbeum, cov|ering his feet with both his hands, bur&s;t into all the impotence of tears, and only implored in terms of the mo&s;t abject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, that his life might be &s;par|ed, and his paternal dominions of Hol&s;tein a&s;&s;igned him. She commanded him to ri&s;e, and conducted him to the palace of Peterhoff, where he &s;ign|ed a paper, by which he re&s;igned all power into her hands. Mean while covered waggons were pro|vided,

which took different roads, that it might not be known in which was the depo&s;ed prince; and this mighty revolution, which transferred the great|e&s;t empire on earth, was effected in a few hours, al|mo&s;t without any confu&s;ion or uproar. The people accu&s;tomed to de&s;poti&s;m, and indifferent who was the ruler, remained &s;ilent and quiet &s;pectators of it, the guards being the only actors, and the whole a repeti|tion of the prince&s;s Elizabeth's conduct &s;ome years be|fore, when young Ivan was depo&s;ed, and &s;he &s;eized the throne.&mdash;Over the re&s;t of this mournful &s;tory we mu&s;t draw a veil. Such a pri&s;oner, it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, could not long remain in that condition. On the ninth day con&s;equent to his &s;eizure it was reported he had a di&s;order in his bowels, and &s;oon after his death was announced. We know no more. Hi&s;tory, in &s;ome future age, may po&s;&s;ibly elucidate his end; but in this century it is not likely &s;uch a &s;ecret will be divulged.</P>
<P>Though I would not, however indirectly, appear the apologi&s;t of crimes, yet ju&s;tice requires I &s;hould &s;ay, that it is univer&s;ally allowed the empre&s;s might plead &s;elf-defence, if not even &s;elf-pre&s;ervation to ju&s;ti|fy her conduct, as it is known that Peter had concert|ed and would have carried into execution the mo&s;t &s;e|vere mea&s;ures again&s;t her if he had not been prevented by &s;o vigorous an attack.

<P>THIS is a great city, a rich city, and a commercial one; but I cannot &s;ay I think it very agreeble, or that it contains much to gain a traveller's attention. Was human life of double the limits nature has a&s;&s;igned to it, one &s;hould not be tempted to vi&s;it it more than once. It mu&s;t however be confe&s;&s;ed I &s;aw it to &s;ome di&s;advantage, not being provided with letters of intro|duction, as I had not intended to have included it in the plan of my tour. By the help, however, of my landlord, to who&s;e good offices nece&s;&s;ity has made me a debtor, I have &s;een every thing de&s;erving attention here, and &s;hall leave it this afternoon perfectly well &s;a|tisfied with my &s;tay. One of the&s;e has appeared to me &s;o extraordinary; and is in it&s;elf, I apprehend, &s;o very
<PB N="171" REF="031692_0171_0FEE0EC31169A440">
&s;ingular, that if I had not been an eye witne&s;s of it, no te&s;timony would have convinced me of its reality; and if it was not of &s;uch a nature as to be univer&s;ally examined, I &s;hould fear the world would doubt my veracity.</P>
<P>I always apprehended that human bodies after death, if interred, or expo&s;ed to the air without any prepa|ration to defend them from the attacks of it, would of nece&s;&s;ity corrupt, become offen&s;ive and putrify. The art of embalming is very ancient, and was invented to pre&s;erve them from this inevitable con&s;equence of death; but that they may remain unputrified for cen|turies without any &s;ort of artificial aid, I have &s;een &s;o inconte&s;tibly proved &s;ince my arrival, that I imagine not the &s;hadow of doubt can remain about it.</P>
<P>Under the cathedral church is a vaulted apartment, &s;upported on pillars; it is near &s;ixty paces long, and half as many broad. The light and air are con&s;tantly admitted into it by three windows, though it is &s;everal feet beneath the level of the ground. Here are five large oak coffers, rather than coffins, each containing a corp&s;e. I examined them &s;everally for near two hours. The mo&s;t curious and perfect, is that of a wo|man. Tradition &s;ays &s;he was an Engli&s;h counte&s;s, who dying here at Bremen, ordered her body to be pla|ced in this vault uninterred, in the apprehen&s;ion that her relations would cau&s;e it to be brought own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> her

native country. They &s;ay it has lain here 250 years. Though the mu&s;cular &s;kin is totally dried in every part, yet &s;o little are the features of the face &s;unk or changed, that nothing is more certain than that &s;he was young, and even beautiful. It is a &s;mall counte|nance, round in its contour. The cartilage of the no&s;e and the no&s;trils have undergone no alteration. Her teeth are all firm in the &s;ockets, but the lips are drawn away from over them. The cheeks are &s;hrunk in, but yet le&s;s than I ever remember to have &s;een in embalmed bodies. The hair of her head is at this time more than eighteen inches long, very thick, and &s;o fa&s;t, that I heaved the corps out of the coffer by it. The colour is a light brown, and as fre&s;h and glo&s;&s;y, as that of a living per&s;on. That this lady was of high rank &s;eems evident, from the extreme finene&s;s of the linen which covers her body; but I have in vain en|deavoured to procure any lights into her hi&s;tory, her title, or any other particulars, though I have taken no little pains for that purpo&s;e. The landlord of the inn, who was with me, &s;aid he remembered it for forty years pa&s;t, during which time there is not the lea&s;t per|ceptible alteration in it.</P>
<P>In another coffer is the body of a workman, who is &s;aid to have tumbled off the church, and was killed by the fall. His features evince this mo&s;t forcibly. Extreme agony is marked in them. His mouth is
<PB N="173" REF="031692_0173_0FEE0EC627F5B0C8">
wide open, and his eye-lids the &s;ame. The eyes are dri|ed up. His brea&s;t is unnaturally di&s;tended, and his whole frame betrays a violent death.</P>
<P>A little child who died of the &s;mall-pox is &s;till more remarkable. The marks of the pu&s;tules, which have broken the &s;kin on his hands and head, are very di&s;|cernible; and one &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that a body which died of &s;uch a di&s;temper, mu&s;t contain in a high de|gree the &s;eeds of putrefaction.</P>
<P>The two other corp&s;es are not le&s;s extraordinary. There are in this vault, likewi&s;e, turkeys, hawks, wea|&s;els, and other animals, which have been hung up here; &s;ome, time immemorial, &s;ome very lately; and are in the mo&s;t complete pre&s;ervation; the &s;kin, bills, feathers, all unaltered. The cau&s;e of this phaenome|non is, doubtle&s;s, the dryne&s;s of the place where they are laid. It is in vain to &s;eek for any other. The mag|i&s;trates do not permit that any fre&s;h bodies be brought here, and there is no other &s;ubterranean chamber which has the &s;ame property. It would have made an excellent miracle two or three centuries ago in pro|per hands, but now mankind are grown too wi&s;e.</P>
<P>This city is celebrated for its old hock. The wine is all brought from the banks of the Rhine by land carriage, and depo&s;ited in the public cellars. The&s;e are wondrou&s;ly capacious, running beneath the Town-Hou&s;e and Exchange; but are not comparable in mag|nificence

<P>Bremen &s;tands upon the river We&s;el. Ve&s;&s;els of burden lie twelve or fifteen miles below the city, there not being &s;ufficient depth of water higher up. It con|tains 45,000 inhabitants.

The king of England, as elec|tor of Hanover, has, however, &s;ome important rights within the place; and not only the cathedral belongs to him, but a con&s;iderable number of buildings, public and private. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, likewi&s;e, a &s;pecies of &s;u|preme judicatorial power, as, though the magi&s;trates take cognizance of all crimes within the territory of Bremen, his delegate or bailiff mu&s;t pronounce &s;en|tence.

<HEAD>SECT. XXIX. CONVERSATION AT COURTRAY IN FLAN|DARS WITH AN IMPATIENT PASSENGER FOR THE DEPARTURE OF A DILIGENCE.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE I was changing hor&s;es, I was peculiarly &s;tricken with the &s;ingular impatience of a pa&s;&s;enger for the departure of the diligence. I ob&s;erved him to intreat his companions, with a gentlene&s;s and elegant courte&s;y, to ha&s;ten the &s;ame; then he flew to the land|lord, to give his commands to the driver, then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the driver him&s;elf, then to the &s;table to &s;ee if the hor&s;es were harne&s;&s;ed; then to the gateway biting his nails, and walking backwards, and forward, much agitated. His countenance was urgently thoughtful; his complex|ion livid; his eyes &s;unk into his head, and over-arched with a large circular and black brow; his look altogether &s;eemed hagged through fatigue, and an inward dejec|tion which preyed upon him. I judged him to be a|bout five and thirty years of age. He was genteel; a|bove the common in his manner, but very negligently attired. In &s;hort, his appearance touched me home, and awakened my curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>Mon Dieu! cried the Flemi&s;h Whip, that there was a little more patience in the world.&mdash;It would
<PB N="178" REF="031692_0178_0FEE0ED98E7FDE48">
be a &s;ix &s;ous out of your pocket, if there was, I thought within my&s;elf; for I ob&s;erved the impatient pa&s;&s;enger to give him that little &s;um, as a &s;timulus to accelerate his motions.</P>
<P>A difficulty aro&s;e, which increa&s;ed the pa&s;&s;enger's impatience beyond all bounds. He was almo&s;t mad with di&s;appointment; for as the diligence was prepar|ing to &s;et off, a female pa&s;&s;enger was unfortunately mi&s;&s;ing, who, having &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s in the own, ab|&s;ented her&s;elf till the u&s;ual time of its departure; and now the driver declared that it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;et off before the clock &s;truck a certain hour, the &s;tated time for its departure, unle&s;s Madame arrived.</P>
<P>My barouche was, at this in&s;tant, drawing up to the door; and as curio&s;ity was fermenting ju&s;t as &s;trong in me as impatience in the pa&s;&s;enger, I offered him a feat in it; concluding, Ghent was his next &s;tation.</P>
<P>There was a polite gratitude in the manner with which he accompanied his &s;imple thanks; and he flew like an arrow to the diligence, &s;natching out of it a &s;mall vali&s;e. We a&s;cended our vehicle, and it moved in time to the impetuo&s;ity of my companion's wi&s;hes. A cloud of melancholy &s;oon over&s;hadowed his coun|tenance; his eyes were immoveably fixed, and thought &s;eemed bu&s;y within him. This torpor continued up|on him the greate&s;t part of our &s;tage to Ghent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> except|ing, that now and then, it was broken by a few polite

expre&s;&s;ions, to convince me of the greatne&s;s of his ob|ligation.</P>
<P>I could not avoid puzzling my brain about the cha|racter of this man; turning in my head over and over, the motives that could po&s;&s;ibly ferment &s;uch great im|patience to arrive at the end of his journey.</P>
<P>There was education in his look; which made me addre&s;s him with,
<Q><L>Aurum per medios ire &s;atellites</L>

<L>Ictu ful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>But your pre&s;ent had not the power to procure the departure of the diligence. Horace is certainly right, an&s;wered my companion; the bribe was only of &s;il|ver; the power of gold, doubtle&s;s, would have con|quered the driver's &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">uples about the lady: He would have driven off without her. But when a man is in ha&s;te, I replied, he &s;hould not travel in a Flemi&s;h dili|gence. But this, &s;ays my companion, is the only con|venience, when our bad fortune will not permit us to purcha&s;e a more expeditious one. Pour moi les deni|ers me manque; I am as poor as a church mou&s;e, and this is another rea&s;on for my wi&s;hing to be at the end of my journey; where, God be thanked! I &s;hould have&mdash;Yes, &s;ays my &s;tranger, making a reflective pau&s;e, and repeating the words, "I &s;hould have &s;ome of this

world's trifles."&mdash;Here he turned up his eyes wi&s;h a groan, &s;hrugged up his &s;houlder and pre&s;&s;ed his hands on his knees&mdash;</P>
<P>And why that piteous, mi&s;erable look?&mdash;thy home, and this world's comforts too!&mdash;yet this drew forth&mdash;
<Q><L>&mdash;A &s;igh &s;o hideous and profound,</L>
<L>That it did &s;eem to &s;hatter all his bulk,</L>
<L>And end his being.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>It is unique, I thought, that of all the Frenchmen I ever met with in my life, the natural character of the nation &s;hould prevail &s;o little in my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">-traveller; barring the &s;hrug of his &s;houlder, and the wan meagre countenance, there was nothing Gallic in him. The French, even in the mo&s;t awful periods of their di&s;|tre&s;s, di&s;cover certain intervals, in which the traits of their native cheerfulne&s;s are con&s;picuous; but the &s;pi|rit of my companion &s;eemed enveloped in an endle&s;s gloom.</P>
<P>The &s;ubjects we conver&s;ed on were not much diver|&s;ified, and rather confined to the cla&s;&s;ics. He &s;eemed well read, and his remarks were tinctured with judg|ment. In the cour&s;e of that natural and innocent va|nity, of di&s;playing our little &s;tore of learning, I could not &s;uppre&s;s the effect which the eighth Ode of Hor|ace had upon me, which my companion repeated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> no &s;mall degree of energy. He &s;aid it was his

favourite Ode, when he was once in love. It was like the prota&s;is of ancient drama to me, where the &s;ubject of the piece became entertaining. It &s;u&s;pend|ed for &s;ome time our conver&s;ation, and proved a mo&s;t powerful advocate for the romantic feelings I was brooding upon.&mdash;Aye, &s;ays I,&mdash;

<HEAD>SECT. XXXI. OF THE CITY OF CANTON, IN CHINA.</HEAD>
<P>THE city of Canton is &s;ituate upon the ea&s;t &s;ide of the large river Ta, from the mouth of which it lies a|bout fifty miles. It is defended towards the water by two high walls, and two &s;trong water-ca&s;tles built in the middle of the river Ta.</P>
<P>Canton is the greate&s;t port in China, and the only one frequented by Europeans. The city wall is about five miles in curcumference, with plea&s;ant walks a|round it. On the ea&s;t &s;ide is a large ditch clo&s;e to the wall.</P>
<P>From the tops of &s;ome adjacent hills, on which forts are built, you have a fine pro&s;pect of the country. It is beautifully inter&s;per&s;ed with mountains, little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="187" REF="031692_0187_0FEE0EFD11162D10">
and valleys, all green; and the&s;e again plea&s;antly di|ver&s;ified with &s;mall towns; villages, high towers, tem|ples, the &s;eats of Mandarines and other great men, which are watered with delightful lakes, canals, and &s;mall branches from the river Ta; on which are num|berle&s;s boats and jonks &s;ailing different ways through the mo&s;t fertile places of the country.</P>
<P>The city is entered by &s;even iron gates, and within-&s;ide of each there is a guard-hou&s;e. No European is allowed to enter the&s;e, if known; I have my&s;elf been frequently expelled, after I had been a good way with|in the city, when they di&s;covered that I was a &s;tran|ger. The &s;oldiers, who keep guard, are armed with &s;pears, darts, &s;words; match-lock guns, but mo&s;t of them with bows and arrows, which they &s;till e&s;teem more than any other warlike weapon.</P>
<P>The &s;treets are very &s;traight, but generally narrow, and paved with flag &s;tones.</P>
<P>There are many pretty buildings in the city, great numbers of triumphal arches, and temples well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with images.</P>
<P>The &s;treets of Canton are &s;o crowded, that it is dif|ficult to walk in them; yet you will &s;eldom &s;ee a wo|man of any fa&s;hion, unle&s;s by chance, when coming out of their chairs. And, were it not that curio&s;ity in the Chine&s;e ladies make them &s;ometimes peep at us, we &s;hould never get a glance at them.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="031692_0188_0FEE0F024E0A6BE0">
Though there are no magnificent hou&s;es in Can|ton, mo&s;t of them being built only one, and none more than two &s;tories; yet they take up a large extent of ground, many of them having &s;quare courts with|in their walls.</P>
<P>They have all &s;uch a regard to privacy, that no windows are made towards the &s;treets, but in &s;hops and places of pulic bu&s;ine&s;s. None of their windows look towards tho&s;e of their neighbours. Within the gate or entry of each hou&s;e, a &s;creen is placed, to pre|vent &s;trangers from looking in upon the opening of the gate; and you enter the hou&s;e either on the right or left &s;ide of the middle &s;creen, where there are little al|leys to the right and left, from whence you pa&s;s into the &s;everal courts, which are walled on all &s;ides.</P>
<P>Their entertainments are held in a &s;ort of hall at the entrance of their hou&s;es, which have no other orna|ment, be&s;ides a &s;ingle order of painted columns which &s;upport the building. The roofs are open to the tiles, without any ceiling. In the&s;e they u&s;e no looking-gla&s;&s;es, hangings, or fine chairs; and their beds, which are the principal ornaments of their hou&s;e, are &s;eldom &s;een by &s;trangers, who are not permitted to go farther than the fir&s;t great hall. The Chine&s;e, who keep &s;hops, were le&s;s re&s;erved, and would frequently invite us to their hou&s;es with great freedom, as they ob&s;erved it would be agreeable to us.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="031692_0189_0FEE0F03D88E3588">
The furniture of the be&s;t hou&s;es is cabinets, tables, painted &s;creens, china, pictures, and pieces of white taffety upon the walls, upon which are written in Chi|ne&s;e characters, religious and moral &s;entences.</P>
<P>They have no chimneys; but in their &s;tead, they place a &s;hallow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> pot filled with charcoal, in the middle of the room, in winter, which is ready to &s;uf|focate people who are not accu&s;tomed to it. They have a copper built in brick-work in their kitchen for boiling, much about the heighth of our Engli&s;h &s;toves.</P>
<P>The in&s;ides of their hou&s;es are never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> nor painted, but are covered with thin paper.</P>
<P>The windows are made of cane or rattan. In winter they cut oy&s;ter-&s;hells into diamond-&s;hapes, and &s;et them in wooden frames, which afford but a very dull light.</P>
<P>The &s;hops of tho&s;e that deal in &s;ilk are very neat, make a fine &s;how, and are all in one place; for trade&s;|men, or dealers in one kind of goods, herd together in the &s;ame &s;treet. For this rea&s;on, you may hear the Engli&s;h &s;ailors talking of the &s;treets of Canton, as if they were &s;peaking of London, or &s;ome other Engli&s;h city. The &s;treets where the china-&s;hops are, they call China-row; the &s;treets where clothes are fold, they call Monmouth-&s;treet; that narrow &s;treet where men's caps, &s;hoes, &amp;c. are &s;old, is well known by the name of Mandarine Cap-alley; and a narrow pa&s;&s;age clo&s;e
<PB N="190" REF="031692_0190_0FEE0F0566D7EC88">
by the city-wall, where lapidary and gla&s;s-work are &s;old, is called Stone-cutters alley; and &s;o of many oth|ers. The &s;hops have counters, drawers, and divi|&s;ions, much like our own; and there are few of the merchants but have a per&s;on who can &s;peak broken Engli&s;h or Portugue&s;e. So that French, Dutch, and Danes, are obliged to &s;peak either the one or the other when they traffic with them.</P>
<P>There are great numbers of market-places for fi&s;h, fle&s;h, poultry, garden herbs, and all provi&s;ions. Eve|ry thing is &s;old cheap. Fi&s;hmongers keep their fi&s;hes in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> alive. Carp, and all other fi&s;h are here in variety and plenty, but have a muddy ta&s;te. I have &s;een the fi&s;hermen take great numbers of different fi&s;h|es in the ditch on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the city-wall, where a multitude of &s;mall boats or &s;ampans are continually plying. The ditch goes quite round the city, and &s;ome &s;mall canals run in it; and as it has a connec|tion with the river Ta, it is of great advantage to the city.</P>
<P>I was very much &s;urpri&s;ed at fir&s;t, to &s;ee dogs, cats, rats, frogs, &amp;c. in their market-places for &s;ale. But I &s;oon found that they made no &s;cruple of eating any &s;ort of meat, and have as good an appetite for that which died in a ditch, as that which was killed by a butcher.</P>
<P>The dogs and cats, which they generally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words">

live in ba&s;kets, were for the mo&s;t part young and fat, and kept very clean.</P>
<P>The rats, &s;ome of which are of a mon&s;trous &s;ize, were very fat, and commonly hung up with the &s;kin upon them, on nails at the po&s;ts of the market-place.</P>
<P>Frogs, which are the greate&s;t dainty here, are &s;old very dear. They are black and loath&s;ome to an Eu|ropean eye; but the Chine&s;e &s;ay they have a very fine ta&s;te. The rats, they &s;ay, eat well; and &s;nake broth has been in reputation there, long before it was known to us. The frogs are &s;trung upon a rod in the &s;ame manner as we do fi&s;h in England.</P>
<P>In pa&s;&s;ing through &s;ome of their &s;treets, I have al|mo&s;t been &s;uffocated by the &s;tench of the hou&s;es on each &s;ide; and particularly a &s;treet about a mile above the Engli&s;h factory, where there was nothing but cook's &s;hops. They had large hogs roa&s;ted whole, and numbers of dogs, cats, and rats on the &s;pit, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> them&s;elves, with their uten&s;ils, had &s;uch a dirty appearance, that the &s;ight and &s;mell might almo&s;t &s;atisfy even the keene&s;t European appetite.

<P>The common people eat four times a day; and are &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;httons, that, if they are ever &s;o much engaged in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, they will ha&s;tily leave it, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> hour.

<P>In the &s;treets of Canton, we often meet with blind beggars, of both &s;exes, a di&s;ea&s;e which &s;ome imagine is the con&s;equence of their living &s;o much on rice; but I rather think it may be occa&s;ioned by the hot winds which blow here at certain &s;ea&s;ons. They are indeed mi&s;erable objects, and commonly go naked, excepting a trou&s;er or cloth over their middle. They go &s;ometimes in companies, and are &s;ure to plague and follow the Europeans; becau&s;e from one of them they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ill get more at one time than from a dozen of their own countrymen. The Chine&s;e are very uncharita|ble. I never &s;aw them give money to a beggar; but they generally put them off with a &s;mall handful of rice.</P>
<P>As it is natural for Europeans to let flip no oppor|tunity of &s;eeing the fair &s;ex, and as the women there are kept &s;o very private, that many of us have made &s;eve|ral voyages thither, without having &s;een a woman a|bove the lowe&s;t rank, we were now and then induced, on proper occa&s;ions, to pry into the mo&s;t retired and unfrequented places, where we imagined the females might be le&s;s upon their guard; as few Europeans <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> thereabouts to di&s;turb them.

curio&s;ity was &s;eldom entirely di&s;appointed. Sometimes we would pop in upon a percel of young boys and girls, attended by their nur&s;es, who were all &s;o affright|ed at the fight of Fanquay, as they called us, that they would &s;cream aloud, run into their hou&s;es, and, by the noi&s;e, alarm the whole &s;treet.

<P>Now and then, on turning a corner, or entering a private &s;treet, all of a &s;udden we found our&s;elves in the mid&s;t of a company of young ladies conver&s;ing o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> playing together; which immediately &s;et them all a &s;creeming, and made them run for &s;helter into their &s;everal apartments.</P>

They &s;eemed &s;o affrighted, and walked &s;o awkwardly, that we were glad to retire, le&s;t we &s;hould have made them &s;tumble and fall, for which we &s;hould certainly have been bamboo'd.</P>
<P>The complexion of the ladies is exceedingly fair, their hair of the fine&s;t black, dre&s;&s;ed up with gold and &s;ilver bodkins, adorned with flowers. Their &s;hape is exqui&s;itely fine, and their dre&s;&s;es the mo&s;t becoming, natural, ea&s;y and &s;plendid of any I ever &s;aw.</P>
<P>It is reckoned, that there are in the city and &s;uburbs of Canton 1,200,000 people; and you will &s;carce find a day in the whole year, but there are 5000 trading ve&s;&s;els lying before the city.</P>
<P>The temples and places of public wor&s;hip are the mo&s;t magnificent buildings in Canton. They are well filled with images. The people pay profound adoration to them, by falling down on their knees be|fore them, wringing their hands, and beating their foreheads again&s;t the ground.

The lower part of it is built with fine hewn &s;tone, but the upper part is all of timber. We went fir&s;t into the lower hall, where we &s;aw images of all &s;izes, of different dignities, and finely gilded, and kept exceedingly clean by the prie&s;ts. The le&s;&s;er images, were placed in corners of the wall, and one of a larger &s;ize in the middle of the hall. The large god, who is placed in the center, &s;its in a lazy po&s;ture, almo&s;t na|ked, and leaning on a large cu&s;hion. He is ten times larger than an ordinary man, very corpulent, of a merry countenance, and gilt all over. We were next conducted up &s;tairs, where we &s;aw a great many ima|ges of men and women; who had been deified for their brave and virtuous actions.</P>
<P>Though Canton is but twenty-four degrees from the equator, and is &s;corching hot in &s;ummer, yet about the months of December and January, it is &s;ubject to high winds and very heavy rains. The &s;udden alter|ation which the climate then undergoes, is very &s;urpri|&s;ing. At this time the people of China take to their winter dre&s;s, which is lined with furs, or quilted cot|ton. In&s;tead of wearing fans, which are u&s;ed by men, women, and children, in hot weather, they hold a live quail in their hands to keep them warm, and have the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;leeves of their gowns drawn down to cover their

hands. Thus equipped, they walk &s;o &s;tiff, and &s;hrug up their &s;houlders &s;o much, that one would think they were freezing to death.</P>
<P>The river Ta at Canton is &s;omewhat broader than the Thames at London. But the crowds of &s;mall ve&s;|&s;els that ply the Ta, are va&s;tly more numerous. For the &s;pace of four or five miles oppo&s;ite the city of Can|ton, you have an exten&s;ive wooden town of large ve&s;|&s;els and boats, &s;towed &s;o clo&s;ely, that there is &s;carcely room for a large boat to pa&s;s. They are generally drawn up in ranks, with a narrow pa&s;&s;age left for ve&s;|&s;els to pa&s;s and repa&s;s. Some of them are large ve&s;|&s;els of eight or nine hundred tons burden, called jonks, with which they perform their foreign voyages. Here are al&s;o an incredible number of &s;mall boats, in which poor families live all their life long, without e|ver putting a foot on &s;hore. In the&s;e they keep dogs, cats, hogs, gee&s;e, and other dome&s;tic animals, both for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and &s;ale. There is nothing &s;imilar to this in Europe; for the people in this country are &s;o ex|ceedingly numerous, that va&s;t numbers of families are obliged to betake them&s;elves to boats on the river, for want of room, or the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence on land, where almo&s;t every habitable &s;pot is occupied.

<HEAD>SECT. XXXII. OF THE POLICY AND GOVERNMENT OF CHINA.</HEAD>
<P>AMONGST the &s;everal models and plans of gov|ernments which the ancients framed, we &s;hall perhaps meet with none &s;o perfect and exact as is that of the Chine&s;e monarchy. The ancient lawgivers of this potent empire formed it in their days very little differ|ent from what it is in ours. Other &s;tates, according to the common fate of the things of this world, are &s;en&s;ible of the weakne&s;s of infancy; are born mi&s;sha|pen and imperfect; and like men, they owe their per|fection and maturity to time. China &s;eems more ex|empted from the common laws of nature; and as though the Supreme being him&s;elf had founded their empire, the plan of their government was not a whit le&s;s perfect in its cradle, than it is now after the expe|rience and trial of four thou&s;and years.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="031692_0198_0FEE0F233AC570D0">
During all which time the Chine&s;e had never &s;o much as heard of the name of a Republic; and when lately, on the arrival of the Hollanders, they heard of it, it &s;eemed &s;o &s;trange to them, that they have &s;carcely yet done admiring at it. Nothing could make them under&s;tand how a &s;tate could regularly be governed without a king. They looked upon a republic to be a mon&s;ter with many heads, formed by the ambition, headine&s;s, and corrupt inclination of men in times of public di&s;order and confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>As they bear an aver&s;ion to republican govern|ment, &s;o they are yet more &s;et again&s;t tyranny and op|pre&s;&s;ion, which they &s;ay proceeds not from the ab&s;o|lutene&s;s of the prince's power, but from his wildne&s;s, which neither the voice of nature, nor the laws of God can ever countenance. The Chine&s;e are of o|pinion, that the obligation which is laid on their kings not to abu&s;e their power, is rather a mean to confirm and e&s;tabli&s;h them, than to occa&s;ion their ruin; and that this u&s;eful con&s;traint, which they them&s;elve lay on their pa&s;&s;ions, does not more dimini&s;h their power or authority here on earth, than the like con&s;traint derogates from the maje&s;ty and power of the Almigh|ty, who is not the le&s;s powerful becau&s;e he cannot do evil.</P>
<P>An unbounded authority which the laws give the Emperor, and the nece&s;&s;ity which the &s;ame lay upon
<PB N="199" REF="031692_0199_0FEE0F2B0CA71708">
him to u&s;e that authority with moderation and di&s;cre|tion, are the two props which have for &s;o many ages &s;upported this great fabric of the Chine&s;e monarchy. The fir&s;t principle, therefore, that is in&s;tilled into the people, is to re&s;pect their prince with &s;o high a ven|eration as almo&s;t to adore him. They &s;tile him the &s;on of heaven, and the only ma&s;ter of the world. His commands are indi&s;putable. His words carry no le&s;s authority with them than if they were oracles. In &s;hort, every thing that comes from him is &s;acred. He is &s;eldom &s;een, and never &s;poken to but on the knees. The grandees of the court, the princes of the blood, nay, his own brothers bow to the ground, not only when he is pre&s;ent, but even before the throne; and there are &s;et days every week or month, on which the nobility a&s;&s;emble, who meet in one of the courts of the palace to acknowledge the authority of their prince, by their mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive adorations, though he, per|haps, be not there in per&s;on.</P>
<P>When he is ill, the palace is full of Mandarines of every &ograve;rder, who &s;pend night and day, in a large court, in habits proper for the occa&s;ion, to expre&s;s their own grief, and to a&s;k of heaven their prince's cure. Rain, &s;now, cold, or any other inconveniencies, excu&s;e them not from the performance of this duty; and as long as the Emperor is in pain, or in danger, any one that &s;aw the people would think that they feared nothing but the lo&s;s of him.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="031692_0200_0FED379C52B24528">
The towns of China are generally divided into four parts, and tho&s;e again into &s;everal &s;maller divi&s;ions, each of which contains ten hou&s;es, over every one of which &s;ubdivi&s;ions an officer pre&s;ides, who takes no|tice of every thing which pa&s;&s;es in his little ward, tells the Mandarine what contentions or extraordinary things happen, and what &s;trangers come thither or go thence. The neighbourhood is obliged to give mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and in ca&s;e of any alarm to lend one anoth|er a helping hand; for if any theft or robbery is com|mitted during the night, the neighbourhood mu&s;t con|tribute towards repairing the lo&s;s. La&s;tly, in every family the father is re&s;pon&s;ible for the di&s;orders and ir|regularities committed either by his children or &s;ervants.</P>
<P>The gates of the cities are well looked after, and even in time of peace are &s;hut up at the approach of night. In the day time there are guards to examine all who come in. When they ob&s;erve any thing extraordina|ry or &s;u&s;picious, they take the per&s;on up, or inform the Mandarine of it. So that European mi&s;&s;ionaries, who&s;e a&s;pect is infinitely different from that of the Chine&s;e, are known at fir&s;t &s;ight; and tho&s;e who have not the Emperor's approbation, find it very difficult to make a long journey.</P>
<P>In certain places, as at Pekin, as &s;oon as night comes on, they tie chains a-cro&s;s the &s;treets: the guards go the patrole up and down the principal &s;treets, and
<PB N="201" REF="031692_0201_0FEE1076A560C190">
guards and centinels are placed here and there. The hor&s;e go the rounds upon the fortifications; and wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> be to him who is found then from home. Meetings, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">u&s;querades, and balls, and &s;uch like night works, are good, &s;ay the Chine&s;e, for none but thieves and the mob. Orderly people ought, at that time, either to &s;it up providing for their family, or el&s;e to take their re&s;t, that they may be refre&s;hed, and better able the next day to manage the bu&s;ine&s;s of the family.</P>
<P>Gaming is forbidden both to the common people and the gentry. This, however, does not hinder the Chine&s;e from playing, &s;ometimes even &s;o long, as till they had lo&s;t all their e&s;tates, their hou&s;es, their chil|dren, and their wives, which they &s;ometimes hazard upon a card; for there is no degree of extravagance to which the de&s;ire of lucre and riches will not carry a Chine&s;e.</P>
<P>What I have &s;aid concerning wives, that their hu&s;|bands may fell them, or lo&s;e them at play, puts me in mind to give &s;ome account of the rules which their civil con&s;titution, rather than their religion, has ordain|ed concerning marriages. Tho&s;e who have a mind to marry, do not, as among us, follow their own fancies in the choice of a wi&s;e. They never &s;ee the women they are to have, but take her parents' word in the ca&s;e; or el&s;e they have their information from &s;ome old wo|men, who &s;eldom give a ju&s;t de&s;cription of her whom they go to view.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="031692_0202_0FED37AFC5824F10">
The woman's parents generally give money to the&s;e emi&s;&s;aries, to oblige them to give a favourable charac|ter. It is for the advantage of the parents that their daughter &s;hould be reputed hand&s;ome, witty, and gen|teel; becau&s;e the Chine&s;e buy their wives, and, as in other merchandi&s;e, they give more or le&s;s according to the good or bad properties of them.</P>
<P>When the parties are agreed about the price, the contract is made, and the money paid down. Then preparation is made on both &s;ides for the nuptial &s;o|lemnities. When the day of marriage is come, they carry the bride in a &s;umtuous chair, before which go hautboys, drums and fifes, and after it follow her pa|rents, and other particular friends of her family. All the portion which &s;he brings, is her marriage-garments, &s;ome clothes and hou&s;ehold goods, which her father pre&s;ents her with. The bridegroom &s;tands at his door richly attired, waiting for her. He him&s;elf opens the &s;edan, which is clo&s;ely &s;hut; and having conducted her into a chamber, delivers her to &s;everal women, in|vited thither for that purpo&s;e, who &s;pend there the day together in fea&s;ting and &s;porting, while the hu&s;|band in another room entertains his friends acquaint|ance.</P>
<P>This being the fir&s;t time that the bride and bride|groom &s;ee each other, and one, or both, perhaps, not liking their bargain, it is frequently a day of rejoicing
<PB N="203" REF="031692_0203_0FED37EC1A2661B8">
for their gue&s;ts, but of &s;orrow for them&s;elves. The women mu&s;t &s;ubmit, though they do not like, becau&s;e their parents have &s;old them; but the hu&s;bands &s;ome|times are not &s;o complai&s;ant; for there have been &s;ome, who when they fir&s;t opened the &s;edan to receive the bride, repul&s;ed by her &s;hape and a&s;pect, have &s;hut the chair, and &s;ent her and her parents and friends back a|gain, willing rather to lo&s;e their money than enter up|on &s;o bad a purcha&s;e.</P>
<P>Although a man be allowed but one wife, he may have as many concubines as he plea&s;es. All the chil|dren have an equal claim to the e&s;tate, becau&s;e they are reckoned as the children of the wife, even though they be tho&s;e of the concubines. They all call the wife mother, who is indeed &s;ole mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e. The concubines &s;erve and honour her, and have no manner of authority or power but what they derive from her.</P>
<P>The Chine&s;e think it a &s;trange thing that the Europe|ans are not allowed to have concubines; yet they con|fe&s;s it is a commendable &s;ign of moderation in them. But when we ob&s;erved to them the troubles, quarrels, contentions, and jealou&s;ies which many women mu&s;t needs occa&s;ion in a family, they &s;ay that there was no &s;tate without &s;ome inconvenience; but that perhaps there were more cro&s;&s;es in having but one, than in hav|ing many women. The be&s;t way, they owned, was to have none at all.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXXIII. OF CONFUCIOUS.</HEAD>
<P>THIS celebrated Chine&s;e philo&s;opher was born in the kingdom of Lou, which is at pre&s;ent in the pro|vince of Chan, 551 years before the birth of Chri&s;t. He was contemporary with Pythagoras, and a little be|fore Socrates. He was but three years old when he lo&s;t his father, who had enjoyed the highe&s;t offices of the kingdom of Long.</P>
<P>Confucius did not grow in knowledge by degrees, as children u&s;ually do, but &s;eemed to arrive at rea&s;on and the perfection of his faculties almo&s;t from his infancy.</P>
<P>He took no delight in playing, running about, and &s;uch amu&s;ements as were proper for his age. He had a grave and &s;erious deportment, which gained him re|&s;pect, and plainly foretold what he would one day be. But what di&s;tingui&s;hed him mo&s;t was his unexampled and exalted piety. He honoured his relations; he en|deavoured in all things to imitate his grandfather, who was then alive in China, and a mo&s;t holy man. And it was ob&s;ervable, that he never ate any thing but he pro&s;trated him&s;elf on the ground, and offered it fir&s;t to the &s;upreme Lord of heaven.</P>
<P>One day, while he was a child he heard his grand|father fetch a deep &s;igh; and going up to him with
<PB N="205" REF="031692_0205_0FED38AC9E198D18">
much reverence, "May I pre&s;ume," &s;ays he, "with|out lo&s;ing the re&s;pect I owe you, to enquire into the occa&s;ion of your grief? Perhaps you fear that your po&s;terity &s;hould degenerate from your virtue, and di&s;|honour you by their vices." What put this thought in|to your head, &s;ays his grandfather to him; and where have you learnt to &s;peak in this manner? "From your&s;elf," replied Confucius. "I attend diligently to you every time you &s;peak; and I have often heard you &s;ay, that a &s;on, who does not by his virtue &s;upport the glory of his ance&s;tors, does not de&s;erve to bear their name."</P>
<P>After his grandfather's death, Confucius applied him|&s;elf to Teem-&s;e, a celebrated doctor of his time; and under the direction of &s;o great a ma&s;ter, he &s;oon made a va&s;t progre&s;s into antiquity, which he con&s;idered as the &s;ource, from whence all genuine knowledge was to be drawn. This love of the ancients very nearly co&s;t him his life, when he was no more than &s;ixteen years of age. Falling into di&s;cour&s;e one day about the Chine&s;e books with a per&s;on of high quality, who thought them ob&s;cure, and not worth the pains of &s;earching into; "The books you de&s;pi&s;e, &s;ays Con|fucius are full of profound knowledge, which is not to be attained but by the wi&s;e and learned; and the people would think cheaply of them, could they com|prehend them of them&s;elves. This &s;ubordination of
<PB N="206" REF="031692_0206_0FEE0F2C969EB9C8">
&s;pirits, by which the ignorant are dependent upon the knowing, is very u&s;eful, and even nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ociety. Were all families equally rich, and equally powerful, there could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t any form of government; but there would happen a yet &s;tranger di&s;order, if all men were equally knowing; for then every one would be for governing, and none would think them&s;elves obli|ged to obey. Some time ago, added Confucius, an ordinary fellow made the &s;ame ob&s;ervation to me a|bout the books as you have done; and from &s;uch a one indeed nothing better could be expected; but I admire that you, a doctor, &s;hould thus be found &s;peaking like one of the lowe&s;t of the people.</P>
<P>This rebuke had indeed the good effect of &s;ilencing the Mandarine, and bringing him to a better opinion of the learning of his country; yet it vexed him &s;o at the &s;ame time, as it came from almo&s;t a boy, that he would have revenged it by violence, if he had not been prevented.</P>
<P>At the age of nineteen years Confucius took a wife, who brought him a &s;on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> T&s;ou-t&s;e, who, in imi|tation of his father, applied him&s;elf entirely to the &s;tu|dy of wi&s;dom, and by his merit arrived to the highe&s;t offices of the empire. Confucius was content with his wife only, &s;o long as &s;he lived with him; and never kept any concubines, as the cu&s;tom of his country would have allowed him to have done, becau&s;e he thought

it contrary to the law of nature. I &s;ay, &s;o long as &s;he lived with him; for it &s;eems he divorced her after &s;ome time, and for no other rea&s;on, &s;ay the Chine&s;e, but that he migh be free from all incumbrances and con|nections, and at liberty to propogate his philo&s;ophy throughout the empire. At the age of twenty-three, when he had gained a con&s;iderable knowledge of anti|quity, and acquainted him&s;elf with the laws and cu&s;|toms of his country, he began to project a &s;cheme for a general reformation; for then every province of the empire was a di&s;tinct kingdom, which had its particu|lar laws and was governed by a prince.</P>
<P>To &s;ay the truth, all the little kingdoms depended upon the emperor; but it often happened that the im|perial authority was not able to keep them within the bounds of their duty. Every one of the&s;e kings was ma&s;ter in his dominions. They levied taxes, impo|&s;ed tributes, di&s;po&s;ed of dignities and offices, declared war again&s;t their neighbours when they thought pro|per, and &s;ometimes became formidable to the emperor him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Confucius, wi&s;ely per&s;uaded that the people could never be happy, &s;o long as avarice, ambition, voluptu|ou&s;ne&s;s, and fal&s;e policy &s;hould reign in this manner, re&s;olved to preach up a &s;evere morality; and accord|ingly he began to enforce temperance, ju&s;tice, and oth|er virtues, to en&s;pire a contempt of riches and out|ward

pomp, to excite to magnanimity and a greatne&s;s of, &s;oul, which &s;hould make men incapable of di&s;&s;imula|tion and in&s;incerity: and to u&s;e all the means he could think of, to redeem his countrymen from a life of plea|&s;ure to a life of rea&s;on. He was every where known, and as much beloved. His extreme knowledge and great wi&s;dom &s;oon made him known; his integrity, and the &s;plendor of his virtues made him beloved. Kings were governed by his wi&s;dom, and the people reverenced him as a &s;aint. He was offered &s;everal high offices in the magi&s;tracy which he &s;ometimes ac|cepted; but never from a motive of ambition, which he was not at all concerned to gratify, but always with a view of reforming a corrupt &s;tate, and amend|ing mankind: for he never failed to re&s;ign tho&s;e of|fices, as &s;oon as he perceived that he could be no lon|ger u&s;eful in them. Thus, for in&s;tance, he was rai&s;|ed to a con&s;iderable place of tru&s;t in the kingdom of Lou, his own native country; where he had not exer|ci&s;ed his charge above three months, when the court and provinces, through his coun&s;els and management, were become quite another thing. He corrected ma|ny frauds and abu&s;es in the mercantile way, and redu|ced the weights and mea&s;ures to their proper &s;tandard. He inculcated fidelity and candour among the men, and exhorted the women to cha&s;tity and &s;implicity of manners. By &s;uch methods he wrought a general

reformation, and e&s;tabli&s;hed every where &s;uch con cord and unanimity, that the whole kingdom &s;eemed as if it were but one great family.</P>
<P>The neighbouring princes began to be jealous. They ea&s;ily perceived, that a king, under the coun&s;els of &s;uch a man as Confucius, would quickly render him&s;elf too powerful; &s;ince noting can make a &s;tate flouri&s;h more than good order among the members, and an exact ob&s;ervance of its laws. Alarmed at this, the king of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a&s;&s;embled his mini&s;ters to con&s;ider of methods, which might put a &s;top to the career of this new government; and after &s;ome deliberations the fol|lowing expedient was re&s;olved upon. They got to|gether a great number of young girls, of extraordinary beauty, who had been in&s;tructed from their infancy in &s;inging and dancing, and were perfect mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of all tho&s;e charms and accompli&s;hments, which might plea&s;e and captivate the heart. The&s;e, under the pre|text of an emba&s;&s;y, they pre&s;ented to the king of Lou, and to the grandees of his court. The pre&s;ent was joy|fully received, and had its de&s;ired effect. The arts of good government were immediately neglected, and no|thing was thought of, but inventing new plea&s;ures for the entertainment of the fair &s;trangers. In &s;hort, nothing was regarded for &s;ome months, but fea&s;ting, dancing, &s;hows, &amp;c. and the court was entirely di&s;|&s;olved in luxury and plea&s;ure. Confucius had fore|&s;een
<PB N="210" REF="031692_0210_0FEE0F3E09700BD0">
all this, and endeavoured to prevent it by advi|&s;ing the refu&s;al of the pre&s;ent; and he now laboured to take off the delu&s;ion they were fallen into, and to bring men back to rea&s;on and their duty. But all his endeavours proved ineffectual. There was nothing to be done; and the &s;everity of the philo&s;opher, whether he would or no, was obliged to give way to the over|bearing fa&s;hion of the court. Upon which he imme|diately quitted his employment, becoming an exile at the &s;ame time from his native country, to try, if he could find in other kingdoms, minds and di&s;po&s;itions more fit to reli&s;h and pur&s;ue his maxims.</P>
<P>He pa&s;&s;ed through the kingdoms of T&s;i, Guci, and T&s;om, but met with in&s;urmountable difficulties every where. He had the misfortune to live in times, when rebellion, wars, and tumults raged throughout the empire. Men had no time to li&s;ten to his philo&s;ophy. They had even le&s;s inclination to do it; for as we have &s;aid, they were ambitious, avaricious, and voluptuous. Hence be often met with ill treatment and reproach|ful language, and it is &s;aid, that con&s;piracies were formed again&s;t his life; to which may be added, that his neglect of his own intere&s;ts had reduced him to the extreme&s;t poverty. Some philo&s;ophers among his contemporaries were &s;o effected with the terrible &s;tate of things, that they had ru&s;ticated them&s;elves into the mountains and de&s;erts, as the only places where happi|ne&s;s
<PB N="211" REF="031692_0211_0FEE0F3F93DF5B48">
could be found; and would have per&s;uaded Con|fucius to follow them. But, "I am a man, &s;ays Con|fucius, and cannot exclude my&s;elf from the &s;ociety of men, and con&s;ort with boa&s;ts. Bad as the times are, I &s;hall do all that I can to recal men to virtue; for in virtue are all things, and if mankind would but once imbrace it, and &s;ubmit them&s;elves to its di&s;cipline and laws, they would not want me nor any body el&s;e to in&s;truct them. It is the duty of a good man, fir&s;t to perfect him&s;elf, and then to perfect others. Human nature, &s;aid he, came to us from heaven pure and per|fect; but in proce&s;s of time, ignorance, the pa&s;&s;ions, and evil examples, have corrupted it. All con&s;i&s;ts in re&s;toring it to its primative beauty: and to be perfect, we mu&s;t re-a&s;cend to that point, from whence we have fallen. Obey heaven, and follow the orders of, him who governs it. Love your neighbour as your&s;elf. Let your rea&s;on, and not your &s;en&s;es, be the rule of your conduct; for rea&s;on will teach you to think wi&s;e|ly, to &s;peak prudently, and to behave your&s;elf worthily on all occa&s;ions."</P>
<P>Confucius in the mean time, though he had with|drawn him&s;elf from kings and palaces, did not cea&s;e to travel about, and do what good he could among the people, and among mankind in general. He &s;ent &s;ix hundred of his di&s;ciples into different parts of the empire, to reform the manners of the people; and not
<PB N="212" REF="031692_0212_0FEE0F49BA386758">
&s;atisfied with benefiting his own country only, he made frequent re&s;olutions to pa&s;s the &s;eas, and propa|gate his doctrine to the farthe&s;t part of the world. Hardly any thing can be added to the purity of his morality. He &s;eems rather to &s;peak like a doctor of a revealed law, than like a man who had no light, but what the law of nature afforded him: and what con|vinces us of his &s;incerity is, that he taught as forci|bly by example as by precept. In &s;hort, his gravity and &s;obriety, his rigorous ab&s;tinence, his contempt of riches and what are commonly called the goods of this life, his continual attention and watchfulne&s;s over his actions, and above all that mode&s;ty and humility, which are not to be found among the Grecian &s;ages; all the&s;e, I &s;ay, would almo&s;t tempt one to believe, that he was not a more philo&s;opher formed by rea&s;on only, but a man in&s;pired by God for the reformation of the world, and to check that torrent of idolatry and &s;u|per&s;tition, which was going to over&s;pread that particu|lar part of it.</P>
<P>Confucius is &s;aid to have lived in retirement three years, and to have &s;pent the latter part of his life in &s;or|row. A few days before, his la&s;t illne&s;s, he told his di&s;ciples with tears in his eyes, that he was overcome, with grief at the &s;ight of the di&s;orders, which prevail|ed in the empire. "The mountain, &s;aid he, is fallen; the high machine is demolli&s;hed, and the &s;ages are all
<PB N="213" REF="031692_0213_0FEE0F4B4B72DCC8">
&s;led." His meaning was, that the edifice of perfection, which he had endeavoured to rai&s;e, was entirely over|thrown. He began to langui&s;h from that time, and on the &s;eventh day before his death, "The kings, &s;aid he, reject my maxims; and &s;ince I am no longer u&s;e|ful on the earth, I may as well leave it." After the&s;e words he fell into a lethargy, and at the end of &s;even days expired in the arms of his di&s;ciples, in the &s;even|ty-third year of his age. Upon the fir&s;t hearing of his death, the king of Lou could not refrain from tears: "The Tien is not &s;atisfied with me, cried he, as Confucius is taken away from me." In reality, wi&s;e men are precious gifts, with which heaven ble&s;|&s;es the earth; and their worth is never &s;o well known till they are taken away. Confucius was lamented by the whole empire, which from that very moment be|gan to honour him as a &s;aint; and e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;uch a veneration for his memory, as will probably la&s;t for e|ver in tho&s;e parts of the world. Kings have built palaces for him in all the provinces, whither the learn|ed go at certain times to pay him homage. There are to be &s;een upon &s;everal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, rai&s;ed in honour of him, in&s;criptions in large characters; "To the great ma&s;ter. To the head doctor. To the &s;aint. To him who taught emperors and kings."</P>
<P>Confucius did not altogether tru&s;t to the memory of his di&s;ciples for the pre&s;ervation of his philo&s;ophy,
<PB N="214" REF="031692_0214_0FEE0F51414E4250">
but committed the &s;ub&s;tance of it to writing. His books are four in number. The fir&s;t is entitled, "Ta Hio the Grand Science, or the School of the Adults." It is this that beginners ought to &s;tudy, fir&s;t, becau&s;e it is, as it were, the porch of the temple of wi&s;dom and virtue. It treats of the care we ought to take in governing our&s;elves, that we may be able afterwards to govern others. The &s;econd book is called, "Tchong Young, or the Immutable Mean;" and treats of the means which ought to be ob&s;erved in all things. The third book, "Yun Lu, or the Book of Maxims," is a collection of &s;ententious and moral di&s;cour&s;es; and the fourth book gives an idea of a perfect govern|ment. They who would have a perfect knowledge of all the&s;e works, will find it in the Latin of father Noel, one of the mo&s;t ancient mi&s;&s;ionaries of China, which was printed at Prague in the year 1711.</P>

It is com|puted that in China there are &s;eventy millions of peo|ple, though it does not &s;eem to be more than three times the &s;ize of great Britain, which does not contain above &s;even or eight millions.

<P>The Chine&s;e language bears no affinity to any lan|guage, dead or living, with which we are acquainted. All other languages have an alphabet compo&s;ed of a certain number of letters, by the various combina|tions of which, &s;yllables and words are formed. Whereas there is no alphabet of the Chine&s;e language; but there are as many different characters and figures as words. The number of Chine&s;e characters is com|puted to be about 80,000. A per&s;on, however, that under&s;tands 10,000 characters is able to expre&s;s him|&s;elf in this language, and to under&s;tand many books.

mo&s;t of them written in a &s;mall character, and very thick. It is certain that no language in the world is more copius than the Chine&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;e of the Chine&s;e language is very much varied by the different accents, inflections, tones, a&s;|pirations, and other changes of the voice; hence it is, that per&s;ons, who are not exceedingly well ver&s;ed in this language, often mi&s;take one word for another. Of this father du Halde gives &s;ome examples; &s;uch as that the world Tchu, when differently &s;ounded, &s;igni|fies a lord, or ma&s;ter, a hog, a kitchen, or a column. In like manner the &s;yllable Po, has, according as it is &s;ounded, the following different meanings; gla&s;s, wi&s;e, liberal, to prepare, an old woman, to break, to cleave, inclined, a very little, to water, a &s;lave, a captive, to boil, to winnow rice. Likewi&s;e the &s;ame word join|ed to others is capable of a variety of &s;en&s;es.

<HEAD>SECT. XXXV. OF THE TEA-PLANT.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the vegetable productions of China, the tea-plant is the mo&s;t valuable. The &s;hrub, which &s;eems to be a &s;pecies of myrtle, &s;eldom grows beyond the &s;ize of a ro&s;e-bu&s;h, or at mo&s;t &s;ix or &s;even feet in heighth, though &s;ome have extended it to an hundred. It &s;ucceeds be&s;t in a gravelly &s;oil, and is u&s;ually plant|ed in rows upon little hills, about three or four feet di&s;tant from each other. Its leaves are about an inch and an half long, narrow, tapering to the point, and indented like our ro&s;e or &s;weet-briar leaves, and its flow|ers are much like tho&s;e of the latter. The &s;hrub is an e|vergreen, and bears a &s;mall fruit which contains &s;eve|ral round blacki&s;h &s;eeds, about the bigne&s;s of a large pea; but &s;carce above one in an hundred comes to per|fection. By the&s;e &s;eeds the plant is propagated, nine or ten of them being put into a hole together; and the &s;hrubs thence ari&s;ing are afterwards tran&s;planted into proper ground. They thrive be&s;t when expo&s;ed to the &s;outh-&s;un, and yield the be&s;t tea; but there is a &s;ort that grows without any cultivation, which, though le&s;s valuable, often &s;erves the poorer &s;ort of people.</P>
<P>The Chine&s;e know nothing of imperial tea, and &s;ev|eral other names which in Europe &s;erve to di&s;tingui&s;h
<PB N="219" REF="031692_0219_0FEE0F6364D44C88">
the goodne&s;s and price of this fa&s;hionable commodity. In truth, tho' there be various kinds of tea, they are now generally allowed to be the produce of the &s;ame plant, only differing in the colour, fragrancy, &amp;c. according to the difference of &s;oil, the time of gathering it, and the method of preparation. Bohi or Bohea tea, is &s;o called, not from the mountains of Bokein, where the be&s;t of that &s;ort is &s;aid to grow, but from its dark and black|i&s;h colour. This chiefly differs from the green tea, by its being gathered &s;ix or &s;even weeks &s;ooner, that is in March or April, according as the &s;ea&s;on proves, when the plant is in full bloom, and the leaves full of juice; whereas the other, by being left &s;o much the longer up|on the tree, lo&s;es a great part of its juice, and contracts a different colour, ta&s;te, and virtue.</P>
<P>The green tea is mo&s;t valued and u&s;ed in China; and the Bohea &s;eems not to have been known there till about the conclu&s;ion of the fifteenth century; for a ju|dicious Hollander, who was phy&s;ician and botani&s;t to the emperor of Japan at that period, tells us that he had heard of the Bohi or black tea being come into vogue in China; but upon the &s;tricte&s;t &s;earch he could make, could find no &s;uch thing, and therefore believed it was a fal&s;e report. This makes it probable, that ori|ginally they gathered all the tea at the &s;ame time, but that, &s;ince the di&s;covery of the &s;moothne&s;s and excel|lence of the more juicy Bohea, they have carried on
<PB N="220" REF="031692_0220_0FEE0F64F04A0B98">
the experiments &s;till farther, by gathering it at differ|ent &s;ea&s;ons.</P>
<P>As to the manner of curing the tea, the Bohea is fir&s;t dried in the &s;hade, and afterwards expo&s;ed to the heat of the &s;un, or over a &s;low fire, in earthern pans, till it is convolved or &s;hrivelled up (as we &s;ee it) into a &s;mall compa&s;s. The other &s;orts are commonly cri&s;ped and dried as &s;oon as gathered; though according to Dr. Cunninham, the Bohea is dried in the &s;hade, and the green in pans over the fire.</P>
<P>It is very rare to find tea perfectly pure, the Chine&s;e generally mixing other leaves with it to encrea&s;e the quantity; though one would think the price is too mo|derate to tempt them to &s;uch a cheat, it being u&s;ually &s;old among&s;t them for three-pence per pound, and ne|ver for more than nine-pence; &s;o that it is mo&s;t pro|bable the wor&s;t adulterations of it are made by our own retailers.</P>
<P>Bohea, if good, is all of a dark colour, cri&s;p and dry, and has a fine &s;mell.</P>
<P>Green tea is al&s;o to be cho&s;en by its cri&s;pne&s;s, fra|grant &s;mell, and light colour with a blui&s;h ca&s;t; for it is not good if any of the leaves appear dark or browni&s;h.</P>
<P>As to the properties of tea, they are very much con|troverted by our phy&s;icians; but the Chine&s;e reckon it an excellent diluter and purifier of the blood, a great &s;trengthener of the brain and &s;tomach, a promoter of
<PB N="221" REF="031692_0221_0FEE0F667B588910">
dige&s;tion, per&s;piration, and other &s;ecretions. They drink large quantities of it in fevers, in &s;ome &s;orts of colics, and other accute di&s;ea&s;es; and think it corrects the acrimony of the humours, removes ob&s;tructions of the vi&s;cera, and re&s;tores decayed &s;ight. That the gout and &s;tone are unknown in China, is a&s;cribed to the u&s;e of this plant. Some of the virtues attributed to tea, are undoubtedly imaginary, and it has bad ef|fects upon &s;ome con&s;titutions; but experience &s;hows, that &s;everal advantages attend the drinking it with di&s;|cretion. It quickens the &s;en&s;es, prevents drow&s;ine&s;s, corrects the heat of the liver, removes the head-ach, e&s;pecially that proceeding from a crapula, and being greatly a&s;tringent, it &s;trengthens the tone of the &s;to|mach.</P>

are bowed down by the fetters of &s;lavery, condemned to &s;ervitude, and have no influence in public affairs. Their empire is confined within the walls of the Ha|rem. There are their graces and charms entombed. The circle of their life extends not beyond their own family and dome&s;tic duties.</P>
<P>Their fir&s;t care is to educate their children, and a numerous po&s;terity is their mo&s;t fervent wi&s;h. Moth|ers always &s;uckle their children. This is expre&s;sly commanded by Mahomet. "Let the mother &s;uckle her child full two years, if the child does not quit the brea&s;t; but &s;he &s;hall be permitted to wea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> it with the con&s;ent of her hu&s;band."</P>
<P>When obliged by circum&s;tances to take a nur&s;e, they do not treat her as a &s;tranger. She becomes one of the family, and pa&s;&s;es her days amid&s;t the children &s;he has &s;uckled, by whom &s;he is cheri&s;hed and honoured as a &s;econd mother.</P>
<P>Racine, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not only genius, but all the knowledge nece&s;&s;ary to render genius con&s;picuous, &s;tored with the learning of the fine&s;t works of Greece, and well acquainted with oriental manners, gives Phae|dra her nur&s;e as her &s;ole confidante.

<P>The harem is the cradle and &s;chool of infancy. The new-born feeble being is not there &s;waddled and fillet|ed up in a &s;wathe, the &s;ource of a thou&s;and di&s;ea&s;es. Laid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">naked on a mat, expo&s;ed in a va&s;t chamber to the pure air, he breathes freely, and with his delicate limbs &s;prawls at plea&s;ure. The new element in which he is to live, is not entered with pain and tears. Dai|ly bathed beneath his mother's eye, he grows apace. Free to act, he tries his coming powers; rolls, crawls, ri&s;es, and &s;hould he fall, cannot much hurt him&s;elf on the carpet or mat which covers the floor.</P>
<P>He is not bani&s;hed his father's hou&s;e when &s;even years old, and &s;ent to college with the lo&s;s of health and innocence. He does not, 'tis true, acquire much learning. He perhaps can only read and write; but he is healthy, robu&s;t, fears God, re&s;pects old age, has filial piety, and delights in ho&s;pitality; which virtues continually practi&s;ed in his family, remain deeply en|graven in his heart.</P>
<P>The daughter's education is the &s;ame. Whalebone and bu&s;ks, which martyr European girls they know not. They are only covered with a &s;hift till &s;ix years

old; and the dre&s;s they afterwards wear, confines none of their limbs, but &s;uffers the body to take its true form: and nothing is more uncommon than ricketty children and crooked people.

Apel|les would &s;till find models worthy of his pencil there.</P>
<P>The care of their children does not wholly employ the women. Every other dome&s;tic concern is theirs. They overlook their hou&s;ehold, and do not think them&s;elves deba&s;ed, by preparing their own food, and that of their hu&s;bands. Former cu&s;toms &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ing, render the&s;e cares duties.

<P>While a vi&s;itor is in the harem, the hu&s;band mu&s;t not enter; it is the a&s;ylum of ho&s;pitality, and cannot be violated without fatal con&s;equences; a cheri&s;hed right, which the Egyptian women carefully maintain, being intere&s;ted in its pre&s;ervation.

Naples, to be &s;ure, is more eligible in &s;ummer, as the air is con&s;tantly refre&s;hed by the &s;ea breeze, when Rome is often &s;corched by the mo&s;t in&s;upportable heat.</P>

This delightful coa&s;t, once the garden of all Italy, and inhabited only by the rich, the gay, and luxurious, is now abandoned to the poore&s;t and mo&s;t mi&s;erable of mortals. Perhaps there is no &s;pot on the globe that has undergone &s;o through a change, or that can exhibit &s;o &s;triking a picture of the vanity of human grandeur. Tho&s;e very walls that once lodged a Cae|&s;ar, a Lucullus, an Anthony, the riche&s;t and mo&s;t vo|luptuous of mankind, are now occupied by the very meane&s;t and mo&s;t indigent wretches on earth, who are actually &s;tarving for want in tho&s;e very apartments that were the &s;cenes of the greate&s;t luxury.

Indeed, this part of our earth &s;eems already to have undergone the &s;entence pronounced upon the whole of it; but, like the phoenix, has ri&s;en again from its own a&s;hes, in much greater beauty and &s;plendour than before it was con&s;umed. The traces of the&s;e dreadful conflagrations are &s;till con&s;picuous in every corner; they have been violent in their operations, but in the end have prov|ed &s;alutary in their effects.

<HEAD>SECT. XXXVIII. OF STROMBOLO.</HEAD>
<P>THE Lipari I&s;lands are very picture&s;que, and &s;eve|ral of them &s;till emit &s;moke, particularly Volcano and Volcanello; but none of them, for &s;ome ages pa&s;t, ex|cept Strombolo, have made any eruptions of fire. It appears to be a Volcano of a very different nature from Ve&s;uvius, the explo&s;itions of which &s;ucceed one ano|ther with &s;ome degree of regularity, and have no great variety of duration. I cannot account for the variety of Strombolo.&mdash;Sometimes its explo&s;ions re&s;emble
<PB N="240" REF="031692_0240_0FEE0FAC812F9E90">
tho&s;e of Ve&s;uvius, and the light &s;eems only to be occa|&s;ioned by the quantity of fiery &s;tones thrown into the air; and as &s;oon as the&s;e have fallen down, it appears to be extingui&s;hed, till another explo&s;ion cau&s;es a fre&s;h illumination. This I have ob&s;erved always to be the ca&s;e with Ve&s;uvius, except when the lava has ri&s;en to the &s;ummit of the mountain, and continued without variety to illuminate the air round it. The light from Strombolo evidently depends on &s;ome oth|er cau&s;e. Sometimes a clear red flame i&s;&s;ues from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the mountain, and continues to blaze with|out interruption, for near the &s;pace of half an hour. The fire is of a different colour from the explo&s;ions of &s;tones, and is evidently produced from a different cau&s;e. It would &s;eem as if &s;ome inflammable &s;ub|&s;tance were &s;uddenly kindled up in the bowels of the mountain.</P>
<P>The crater of Strombolo &s;eems to be different from that of Ve&s;uvius, and all the old volcanoes that &s;ur|rounded Naples. Of the&s;e, the craters are without exception in the centre, and from the highe&s;t part of the mountain. That of Strombolo is on its &s;ide, and not within two hundred yards of its &s;ummit. From the crater to the &s;ea, the i&s;land is entirely compo&s;ed of the &s;ame &s;ort of a&s;hes and burnt matter as the conical part of Ve&s;uvius; and the quantity of this matter is per|petually increa&s;ing, from the uninterrupted di&s;charge
<PB N="241" REF="031692_0241_0FEE0FB255A42D28">
from the mountain; for of all the volcanos we read of, Strombolo &s;eems to be the only one that burns with|out cea&s;ing. AEtna and Ve&s;uvius often lie quiet for many months, even years, without the lea&s;t appearance of fire, but Strombolo is ever at work, and for ages pa&s;t has been looked upon as the great light-hou&s;e of the&s;e &s;eas.</P>
<P>It is truly wonderful, how &s;uch a con&s;tant and im|men&s;e fire is maintained, for thou&s;ands of years, in the mid&s;t of the ocean! That of the other Lipari i&s;lands &s;eem now almo&s;t extinct, and the force of the whole to be concentered in Strombolo, which acts as one great vent to them all. We &s;till ob&s;erve Volcano and Volcanello throwing out volumes of &s;moke, but during the whole night we could not perceive the lea&s;t &s;park of fire from either of them.</P>
<P>It is probable, that Strombolo, as well as all the re&s;t of the&s;e i&s;lands, is originally the work of &s;ubterrane|ous fire. The matter of which they are compo&s;ed, in a manner demon&s;trates this; and many of the Sici|lian authors confirm it. There are now eleven of them in all, and none of the ancients mention more than &s;even. Fazzello, one of the be&s;t Sicilian authors, gives an account of the production of Volcano, now one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the&s;e i&s;lands. He &s;ays it happened in the early time of the republic, and is re|corded by Eu&s;ebius, Pliny, and others. He adds, that
<PB N="242" REF="031692_0242_0FEE0FB3E00547E8">
even in his time, in the beginning of the &s;ixteenth cen|tury, it &s;till di&s;charged quantities of fire and of pumice &s;tones; but that in the preceeding century there had been a very great eruption of this i&s;land, which &s;hook all Sicily, and alarmed the coa&s;t of Italy as far as Na|ples. He &s;ays the &s;ea boiled all around the i&s;land, and rocks of a va&s;t &s;ize were di&s;charged from the crater; that fire and &s;moke in many places pierced through the waves, and that the navigation among&s;t the&s;e i&s;lands was totally changed; rocks appearing where it was formerly deep water; and many of the &s;traits and &s;hal|lows were entirely filled up. He ob&s;erves that Ari&s;to|tle, in his book on meteors, takes notice of a very ear|ly eruption of this i&s;land, by which not only the coa&s;t of Sicily, but likewi&s;e many cities in Italy were cover|ed with a&s;hes. It has probably been that very erup|tion which formed the i&s;land. He de&s;cribes Strombo|lo to have been, in his time, pretty much the &s;ame as at this day; only that it then produced a great quanti|ty of cotton, which is not now the ca&s;e. The greate&s;t part of it appears to be barren. On the north &s;ide there are a few vineyards; but they are very meagre.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXXIX. AN ACCOUNT OF THE ERUPTION OF MOUNT VESUVIUS, WHICH HAPPEN|ED IN AUGUST, 1779.</HEAD>
<P>AS many poetical de&s;criptions of this eruption will not be wanting, I &s;hall confine mine to &s;imple matter of fact, in plain pro&s;e, and endeavour to convey to my readers, as clearly and di&s;tinctly as I am able, what I &s;aw my&s;elf, and the impre&s;&s;ion it made upon me at the time, without aiming in the lea&s;t at a flowery &s;tyle.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual &s;ymptoms of an approaching eruption, &s;uch as rumbling noi&s;es and explo&s;ions within the bowels of the volcano, a quantity of &s;moke i&s;&s;uing with force from its crater, accompanied at times with an emi&s;&s;ion of red hot &s;coriae and a&s;hes, were manife&s;t, more or le&s;s, during the whole month of July; and to|wards the end of the month, tho&s;e &s;ymptoms were in|crea&s;ed to &s;uch a degree, as to exhibit in the night time the mo&s;t beautiful fire-works that can be imagined.</P>
<P>The&s;e kinds of throws of red-hot &s;coriae, and other volcanic matter, which at night are &s;o bright and lu|minous, appear, in broad day-light like &s;o many black &s;pots in the mid&s;t of the white &s;moke; and it is this cir|cum&s;tance
<PB N="244" REF="031692_0244_0FEE0FBCA93A0038">
which occa&s;ions the vulgar and fal&s;e &s;uppo|&s;ition, that volcanos burn much more during the night than in the day-time.</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day the 5th Augu&s;t, about two o'clock in the af|ternoon, I perceived from my villa at Pau&s;ilipo, in the bay of Naples, from whence one has a full view of Ve&s;uvius (which is ju&s;t oppo&s;ite, and at the di&s;tance of about &s;ix miles in a direct line from it) that the volcano was in a mo&s;t violent agitation. A white and &s;ulphureous &s;moke i&s;&s;ued continually and impetuou&s;ly from its cra|ter, one puff impelling another, and by an accumula|tion of tho&s;e clouds of &s;moke, re&s;embling bales of the white&s;t cotton, &s;uch a ma&s;s of them was &s;oon piled over the top of the volcano, as exceeded the height and &s;ize of the mountain it&s;elf at lea&s;t four times. In the mid&s;t of this very white &s;moke, an immen&s;e quantity of &s;tones, &s;coriae, and a&s;hes, were &s;hot up to a wonderful height, certainly not le&s;s than two thou&s;and feet. I could al&s;o perceive, by the help of one of Ram&s;den's mo&s;t excellent refracting tele&s;copes, at times, a quantity of liquid lava, &s;eemingly very weighty, ju&s;t heaved up high enough to clear the rim of the crater, and then take its cour&s;e impetuou&s;ly down the &s;teep &s;ide of Ve|&s;uvius, oppo&s;ite to Somma. Soon after the lava broke out on the &s;ame &s;ide, from about the middle of the conical part of the volcano, and having run with vio|lence &s;ome hours, cea&s;ed &s;uddenly, ju&s;t before it had
<PB N="245" REF="031692_0245_0FEE0FBE35525078">
arrived at the cultivated parts of the mountain above Portici, near four miles from the &s;pot where it i&s;&s;ued.</P>
<P>During this day's eruption, as I have been credibly informed &s;ince, the heat was intolerable at the towns of Somma and Ottaiano, that the air was darkened in &s;uch a manner, as that objects could not be di&s;tingu&s;h|ed at the di&s;tance of ten feet. Long filaments of vit|rified matter, like &s;pun gla&s;s, were mixed, and fell with the&s;e a&s;hes; and the &s;ulphureous &s;moke was &s;o violent, that &s;everal birds in cages were &s;uffocated, and the leaves of the trees in the neighbourhood of Som|ma and Ottaiano were covered with white &s;alts very corro&s;ive. About two o'clock in the afternoon, an ex|traordinary globe of &s;moke, of a very great diameter, was di&s;tinctly perceived by many of the inhabitants of Portici, to i&s;&s;ue from the crater of Ve&s;uvius, and proceed ha&s;tily towards the mountain of Somma, again&s;t which it &s;truck and di&s;per&s;ed it&s;elf, having left a train of white &s;moke, marking the cour&s;e it had taken. This train I perceived plainly from my villa, as it la&s;ted &s;ome minutes; but I did not &s;ee the globe it&s;elf.</P>
<P>A poor labourer, who was making faggots on the mountain of Somma lo&s;t his life at this time; and his body not having been found, it is &s;uppo&s;ed that, &s;uf|focated by the &s;moke, he mu&s;t have fallen into the val|ley from the craggy rocks on which he was at work, and been covered by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> of lava, that took its
<PB N="246" REF="031692_0246_0FEE0FBFC5B7C690">
cour&s;e through that valley &s;oon after. An a&s;s, that was waiting for its ma&s;ter in the valley, left it very ju|diciou&s;ly as &s;oon as the mountain became violent, and arriving &s;afe home, gave the fir&s;t alarm to this poor man's family.</P>
<P>It was generally remarked, that the explo&s;ions of the volcano were attended with more noi&s;e during this day's eruption, than in any of the &s;ucceeding one's, when, mo&s;t probably, the mouth of Ve&s;uvius was wid|ened, and the volcanic matter had a freer pa&s;&s;age. It is certain, however, that the great eruption of 1767, (which in every other re&s;pect was mild when compared to the late violent eruption) occa&s;ioned much greater concu&s;|&s;ions in the air by its louder explo&s;ions.</P>
<P>Friday, Augu&s;t the 6th, the fermentation in the mountain was le&s;s violent; but about noon there was a loud report, at which time it was &s;uppo&s;ed that a portion of the little mountain within the crater had fallen in. At night the throws from the crater increa&s;|ed, and proceeded evidently from two &s;eparate mouths, which, emitting red-hot &s;coriae, and in different direc|tions, formed a mo&s;t beautiful and almo&s;t continued firework.</P>
<P>On Saturday, Augu&s;t the 7th, the volcano remained much in the &s;ame &s;tate; but about twelve o'clock at night, its fermentation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">crea&s;ed greatly. The &s;econd fever fit of the mountain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;aid to have mani|fe&s;ted

it&s;elf at this time. I was watching its motions from the mole of Naples, which has a full view of the volcano, and had been witne&s;s to &s;everal glorious pic|ture&s;que effects produced by the reflection of the deep red fire which i&s;&s;ued from the crater of Ve&s;uvius, and mounted up in the mid&s;t of the huge clouds, when a &s;ummer &s;torm, called here a <HI>tropea,</HI> come on &s;uddenly, and blended its heavy watery clouds with the &s;ulphu|reous, and mineral ones, which were already like &s;o many other mountains, piled over the &s;ummit of the volcano. At this moment a fountain of fire was &s;hot up to an incredible height, ca&s;ting &s;o bright a light, that the &s;malle&s;t objects could be clearly di&s;tingui&s;hed, at any place within &s;ix miles or more of Ve&s;uvius.</P>
<P>The black &s;tormy clouds pa&s;&s;ing &s;wiftly over, and at times covering the whole or a part of the bright col|umn of fire, at other times clearing away, and giving a full view of it, with the various tints produced by its reverberated light on the white clouds above, in contra&s;t with the pale fla&s;hes of forked lightning that attended the <HI>tropea,</HI> formed &s;uch a &s;cene as no pow|er of art can ever expre&s;s.</P>
<P>That which followed the next evening was &s;urely much more formidable and alarming; but this was more beautiful and &s;ublime than even the mo&s;t lively imagination can paint to it&s;elf. This great explo&s;ion did not la&s;t above <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> minutes, after which
<PB N="248" REF="031692_0248_0FEE0FC8977347D8">
Ve&s;uvius was totally eclip&s;ed by the dark clouds, and there fell a heavy &s;hower of rain.</P>
<P>Some &s;coriae and &s;mall &s;tones fell at Ottaiano dur|ing this eruption, and &s;ome of a very great &s;ize in the valley between Ve&s;uvius and the hermitage. All the inhabitants of the towns at the foot of the volcano were in the greate&s;t alarm, and preparing to abandon their hou&s;es, had the eruption continued longer.</P>
<P>One of his Sicilian maje&s;ty's game keepers, who was out in the fields near Ottaiano, whil&s;t this combined &s;torm was at its height, was greatly &s;urpri&s;ed to find the drops of rain &s;cald his face and hands, which phe|nomenon was probably occa&s;ioned by the clouds hav|ing acquired a great deal of heat in pa&s;&s;ing through the above mentioned column of fire. The king of Naples did me the honour of informing me of this curious circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>Sunday, Augu&s;t the eighth, Ve&s;uvius was quiet till towards &s;ix o'clock in the evening, when a great &s;moke began to gather again over its c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ater, and about an hour after, a rumbling &s;ubterraneous noi&s;e was heard in the neighbourhood of the volcano; the u&s;ual throws of red-hot &s;tones and &s;coriae began and increa&s;ed eve|ry in&s;tant. I was at this time at Pau&s;ilipo, in the com|pany of &s;everal of my countrymen, ob&s;erving with good tele&s;copes the various phenomena in the crater of Ve&s;uvius, which, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> help, we could di&s;tin|gui&s;h
<PB N="249" REF="031692_0249_0FEE0FCA2535B608">
as well as if we had been actually &s;eated on the &s;ummit of the volcano. The crater &s;eemed much en|larged by the violence of la&s;t night's explo&s;ions, and the little mountain no longer exi&s;ted. About nine o'|clock there was a loud report, which &s;hook the hou&s;es of Portici and its neighbourhood to &s;uch a degree, as to alarm their inhabitants, and drive them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> into the &s;treets; and as I have &s;ince &s;een, many windows were broken and walls cracked, by the confu&s;ion of the air from that explo&s;ion, though faintly heard at Naples.</P>
<P>In an in&s;tant a fountain of liquid, tran&s;parent fire began to ri&s;e, gradually increa&s;ing, arrived at &s;o ama|zing a heighth as to &s;trike every one who beheld it with the mo&s;t awful a&s;toni&s;hment. I &s;hall &s;carcely be credited when I affirm, that, to the be&s;t of my judg|ment, the heighth of this &s;tupendous column of fire could not be le&s;s than three times that of Ve&s;uvius it|&s;elf, which ri&s;es perpendicularly near 3700 feet above the level of the &s;ea.</P>
<P>Puffs of &s;moke, as black as can po&s;&s;ibly be ima|gined, &s;ucceeded one another ha&s;tily, and accompani|ed the red-hot tran&s;parent and liquid lava, interrupting its &s;plendid brightne&s;s here and there by patches of the darke&s;t hue.</P>
<P>Within the&s;e puffs of &s;moke, at the very moment of their emi&s;&s;ion from the crater, I could perceive a bright, but pale electrical fire, bri&s;kly playing about in zig-zag lines.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="031692_0250_0FEE0FD18868E888">
The wind was S. W. and though gentle, was &s;uffi|cient to carry the&s;e detatched clouds or puffs of &s;moke out of the column of fire; and a collection of them, by degrees, formed a black and exten&s;ive curtain (if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion) behind it; in other parts of the &s;ky it was perfectly clear and the &s;tars were bright.</P>
<P>The fiery fountain, of &s;o gigantic a &s;ize upon the dark ground above-mentioned, made the mo&s;t glorious contra&s;t imaginable, and the blaze of it reflected &s;trong|ly on the &s;urface of the &s;ea, which was at that time perfectly &s;mooth, added greatly to this &s;ublime view.</P>
<P>The liquid lava, mixed with &s;tones and &s;coriae, after having mounted, I verily believe, at the lea&s;t ten thou|&s;and feet, was partly directed by the wind towards Ot|taiano, and partly falling almo&s;t perpendicularly, &s;till red-hot and liquid, on Ve&s;uvius, covered its whole cone, part of that of the mountain of Somma, and the valley between them. The falling matter being near|ly as vivid and inflamed, as that which was continual|ly i&s;&s;uing fre&s;h from the crater, formed with it one com|plete body of fire, which could not be le&s;s than two miles and a half in breadth, and of the extraordinary heighth above mentioned, ca&s;ting a heat to the di&s;tance of at lea&s;t &s;ix miles around it.</P>
<P>The bru&s;h-wood on the mountain of Somma was &s;oon in a blaze; which flame being of a different tint
<PB N="251" REF="031692_0251_0FEE0FD3149C0810">
from the deep red of the matter thrown out of the vol|cano, and from the &s;ilvery blue of the electrical fire, &s;till added to the contra&s;t of this mo&s;t extraordinary &s;cene.</P>
<P>The black cloud increa&s;ing greatly, once bent tow|ards Naples, and &s;eemed to threaten this fair city with &s;peedy de&s;truction; for it was charged with electrical matter, which kept con&s;tantly darting about it in &s;trong and bright zig-zags, ju&s;t like tho&s;e de&s;cribed by Pliny the younger in his letter to Tacitus, and which accom|panied the great eruption of Ve&s;uvius that proved fatal to his uncle. "Ab altero latere, nubes atra et horren|da, ignei &s;piritus tortois vibrati&s;que di&s;cur&s;ibus rupta, in longas flammarum figuras dehi&s;cebat; fulgoribus illae et &s;imilis et majores."</P>
<P>This volcanic lightning, however, as I particularly remarked, very rarely quitted the cloud, but u&s;ually re|turned to the great column of fire towards the crater of the volcano from whence it originally came. Once or twice, indeed, I &s;aw this lightning (or <HI>ferilla</HI> as it is called here) fall on the top of Somma, and &s;et fire to &s;ome dry gra&s;s and bu&s;hes.</P>
<P>Fortunately for us, the wind increa&s;ing from the S.W. quarter, carried back the threatening cloud ju&s;t as it had reached the city, and began to occa&s;ion great alarm. All public diver&s;ions cea&s;ed in an in&s;tant, and the theatres being &s;hut, the doors of the churches were
<PB N="252" REF="031692_0252_0FEE0FD4A0504EF0">
thrown open. Numerous proce&s;&s;ions were formed in the &s;treets, and women, and children, with di&s;hevel|ed heads filled the air with their cries, in&s;i&s;ting loudly upon the relics of St. Januarius being immediately op|po&s;ed to the fury of the mountain. In &s;hort, the po|pulace of this great city began to di&s;play its u&s;ual ex|travagant mixture of riot and bigotry; and if &s;ome &s;peedy and well-timed precautions had not been taken, Naples would, Perhaps, have been in more danger of &s;uffering from the irregularities of its lower cla&s;s of in|habitants, than from the angry volcano.</P>
<P>But to return to my &s;ubject. After the column of fire had continued in full force near half an hour, the eruption cea&s;ed all at once, and Ve&s;uvius remained &s;ullen and &s;ilent. After the dazzling light of the fiery fountain, all &s;eemed dark and di&s;mal except the cone of Ve&s;uvius, which was covered with glowing cinders and &s;coriae, from under which, at times, here and there, &s;mall &s;treams of liquid lava had e&s;caped, and rolled down the &s;teep &s;ides of the volcano. This &s;cene put me in mind of Martial's de&s;cription of Etna.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XL. OF MOUNT AETNA. MAY 29, 1770.</HEAD>
<P>A FEW days ago, we &s;et off to vi&s;it Mount AEtna, that venerable and re&s;pectable father of mountains. His ba&s;e, and his immen&s;e declivities, are covered over with a numerous progeny of his own; for every great eruption produces a new mountain; and perhaps, by the number of the&s;e, better than by any other method, the number of eruptions, and the age of AEtna it&s;elf, might be a&s;certained.</P>
<P>The whole mountain is divided into three di&s;tinct regions, called <HI>La Regione Culta,</HI> or <HI>Piedmonte&s;e,</HI> The Fertile Region; <HI>La Regione Sylvo&s;a,</HI> or <HI>Nemoro&s;a,</HI> The Woody Region; and <HI>La Regione De&s;erta,</HI> or <HI>Scoperta,</HI> The Barren Region.</P>
<P>The&s;e three are as different, both in climate and pro|ductions, as the three zones of the earth, and perhaps
<PB N="254" REF="031692_0254_0FEF29FBEDFEF2B8">
with equal propriety, might have been &s;tiled the Tor|rid, the Temperate, and the Frigid zone. The fir&s;t region &s;urrounds the foot of the mountain, and con&s;ti|tutes the mo&s;t fertile country in the world on all &s;ides of it, to the extent of about fourteen or fifteen miles, where the woody region begins. It is compo&s;ed almo&s;t entirely of lava, which, after a number of ages, is at la&s;t converted into the mo&s;t fertile of all &s;oils.</P>
<P>At Nicolo&s;i, which is twelve miles up the mountain, we found the barometer at 27 1&frac12;: at Catania it &s;tood at 29 8&frac12; although the former elevation is not very great, probably not exceeding 3000 feet, yet the climate was totally changed. At Catania the harve&s;t was en|tirely over, and the heats were in&s;upportable; here they were moderate, and in many places the corn is as yet green. The road for the&s;e twelve miles is the wor&s;t I ever travelled; entirely over old lavas and the mouths of extingui&s;hed volcanos, now converted into corn-fields, vineyards, and orchards.</P>
<P>The fruit of this region is reckoned the fine&s;t in Si|cily, particularly the figs, of which they have a great variety. One of the&s;e of a very large &s;ize, e&s;teemed &s;uperior in flavour to all the re&s;t, they pretend is pecu|liar to AEtna.</P>
<P>The great eruption of 1669, after &s;haking the whole country around for four months, and forming a very large mountain of &s;tones and a&s;hes, bur&s;t out about a
<PB N="255" REF="031692_0255_0FEF294C926C27F0">
mile above Monpelieri, and de&s;cending like a torrent, bore directly again&s;t the middle of that mountain, and (they pretend) perforated it from &s;ide to &s;ide. This however I doubt, as it mu&s;t have broken the regular form of the mountain, which is not the ca&s;e. But cer|tain it is, that it pierced it to a great depth. The la|va then divided into two branches; and &s;urrounding this mountain, joined again on its &s;outh &s;ide; and lay|ing wa&s;te the whole country betwixt that and Catania, &s;caled the walls of that city, and poured its flaming torrent into the ocean. In its way, it is &s;aid to have de&s;troyed the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of near 30,000 people, and re|duced them to beggary. It formed &s;everal hills where there were formerly valleys, and filled up a large lake, of which there is not now the lea&s;t ve&s;tige to been &s;een.</P>
<P>As the events of this eruption are better known than any other, they tell a great many &s;ingular &s;tories of it; one of which, however incredible it may appear, is well a&s;certained. A vineyard, belonging to a convent of Je|&s;uits, lay directly in its way; this vineyard was form|ed on an ancient lava, probably a thin one, with a number of caverns and crevices under it. The liquid lava entering into the&s;e caverns, &s;oon filled them up, and by degrees bore up the vineyards; and the Je&s;uits, who every moment expected to &s;ee it buried, beheld with amazement the whole field began to move off. It was carried on the &s;urface of the lava to a con&s;iderable
<PB N="256" REF="031692_0256_0FEF294E190570F8">
di&s;tance; and though the greate&s;t part was de&s;troyed, yet &s;ome of it remains to this day.</P>
<P>We went to examine the mouth from whence this dreadful torrent i&s;&s;ued; and were &s;urpri&s;ed to find it only a &s;mall hole, of about three or four yards diame|ter. The mountain from whence it &s;prung, I think, is little le&s;s than the conical part of Ve&s;uvius.</P>
<P>There is a va&s;t cavern on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of it where people go to &s;hoot wild pigeons, which breed there in great abundance. The innermo&s;t parts of this cavern are &s;o very di&s;mal and gloomy, that our landlord told us &s;ome people had lo&s;t th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">en&s;es from having advanced too far, imagining they &s;aw devils and the &s;pirits of the damned, for it is &s;till very generally believed here, that AEtna is the mouth of hell.</P>
<P>We found a degree of wildne&s;s and ferocity in the inhabitants of this mountain, that I have not ob&s;erved any where el&s;e. It was with much difficulty I could per&s;uade them that we were not come to &s;earch for hidden trea&s;ures, a great quantity of which they believe is to be found in Monpelieri; and when I went to that mountain, they were then fully convinced that this was our intention. Two of the men followed me, and kept a clo&s;e eye on every &s;tep that I took; and when I lifted any bit of lava or pumice, they came running up, thinking it was &s;omething very precious; but when they ob&s;erved they were only bits of &s;tones, and that I
<PB N="257" REF="031692_0257_0FEF294F9E721140">
put them into my pocket, they laughed heartily, talk|ing to one another in their mountain jargon, which is unintelligible even to Italians. However, as mo&s;t of them &s;peak Italian &s;o as to be under&s;tood, they a&s;ked me what I was going to make of tho&s;e bits of &s;tone? I told them they were of great value in our country; that the people there had a way of making gold of them. At this they both &s;eemed exceedingly &s;urpri&s;|ed, and &s;poke again in their own tongue. However, I found they did not believe me. One of them told me, if that had been true, I certainly would not have been &s;o ready in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it. But, &s;aid he, if it is &s;o, we will &s;erve you for ever, if you will teach us that art; for then we &s;hall be the riche&s;t people on earth. I a&s;&s;ured them, that I had not yet learned it my&s;elf, and that it was a &s;ecret known only to very few. They were likewi&s;e a good deal &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee me pull out of my pocket a magnetical needle, and a &s;mall electro|meter, which I had prepared at Catania to examine the electrical &s;tate of the air; and I was at fir&s;t afraid they &s;hould have taken me for a conjurer, (which al|ready happened among&s;t the Appenines) but luckily that idea did not &s;trike them.</P>
<P>After leaving Nicolo&s;i, and travelling for about an hour and a half over barren a&s;hes and lava, we arrived on the confines of the Regione Sylvo&s;a, or the Tempe|rate Zone. As &s;oon as we entered the&s;e delightful for|e&s;ts,
<PB N="258" REF="031692_0258_0FEF295A2FB4B908">
we &s;eemed to have got into another world. The air, which before was &s;ultry and hot, was now cool and refre&s;hing; and every breeze was loaded with a thou&s;and perfumes, the whole ground being covered over with the riche&s;t aromatic plants. Many parts of this region are &s;urely the mo&s;t heavenly &s;pots, upon earth; and if AEtna re&s;embles hell within, it may with equal ju&s;tice be &s;aid to re&s;emble paradi&s;e without.</P>
<P>It is indeed a curious con&s;ideration, that this moun|tain &s;hould re-unite every beauty and every horror; and, in &s;hort, all the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite and di&s;&s;imilar ob|jects in nature. Here you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a gulf that former|ly threw out torrents of fire, now covered with the mo&s;t luxuriant vegetation; and from an object of ter|ror, become one of delight. Here you gather the mo&s;t delicious fruit, ri&s;ing from what was but lately a black and barren rock. Here the ground is covered with ev|ery flower; and we wander over the&s;e beauties, and con|template this wilderne&s;s of &s;weets, without con&s;ider|ing that hell, with all its terrors, is immediately under our feet; and that but a few yards &s;eparate us from lakes of liquid fire and brim&s;tone.</P>
<P>But our a&s;toni&s;hment &s;till increa&s;es, on ca&s;ting our eyes on the higher regions of the mountain. There we behold, in perpetual union, the two elements that are at perpetual war; an immen&s;e gulph of fire, for ever exi&s;ting in the mid&s;t of &s;nows which it has not
<PB N="259" REF="031692_0259_0FEF296759755580">
power to melt, and immen&s;e fields of &s;now and ice for ever &s;urrounding this gulph of fire which they have not power to di&s;tingui&s;h.</P>
<P>The woody region of AEtna a&s;cends for about eight or nine miles, and forms a zone or girdle, of the bright|e&s;t green, all around the mountain. This night w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> pa&s;&s;ed through little more than the half of it; arriving &s;ome time before &s;un-&s;et at our lodgings, which was no other than a large cave, formed by one of the mo&s;t ancient and venerable lavas. It is called <HI>La Spelonca dal Capriole,</HI> or the goats cavern, becau&s;e frequented by tho&s;e animals, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> refuge there in bad weather.</P>
<P>Here we were delighted with the contemplation of many grave and beautiful objects; the pro&s;pect on all &s;ides is immen&s;e; and we already &s;eem to be lifted up from the earth, and to have got into a new world.</P>
<P>After taking a comfortable nap in the cave, on a bed of leaves, we awoke about eleven o'clock; and melt|ing down a &s;ufficient quantity of &s;now, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> boiled our tea-kettle, and made a hearty meal to prepare us for the remaining part of our expedition. We were nine in number; for we had our three &s;ervants, the Cyclops (our conductor) and two men to take care of our mules. The Cyclops now began to di&s;play his great knowledge of the mountain, and we followed him with implicit confidence. He conducted us over "Antres <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;t, and De&s;erts wild," where &s;carce human <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> had
<PB N="260" REF="031692_0260_0FEF296F29BEE7A8">
ever trod. Sometimes through gloomy fore&s;ts, which by day-light were delightful; but now, from the uni|ver&s;al darkne&s;s, the ru&s;tling of the trees, the heavy, dull, bellowing of the mountain, the va&s;t expan&s;e of ocean &s;tretched at an immen&s;e di&s;tance below us, in|&s;pired a kind of awful horror. Sometimes we found our&s;elves a&s;cending great rocks of lava, where if our mules &s;hould make but a fal&s;e &s;tep, we might be thrown headlong over the precipice. However, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Cyclops, we overcame all the&s;e difficulties; and he managed matters &s;o well, that in the &s;pace of two hours, we fou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> had got above the regions of vegetation, and had left the fore&s;t of AEtna far behind. The&s;e appeared now like a dark gloomy gulf below us, that &s;urrounded the mountain.</P>
<P>The pro&s;pect before us was of a very different na|ture; we beheld an expan&s;e of &s;now and ice that alar|med us exceedingly, and almo&s;t &s;taggered our re&s;olu|tion. In the centre of this, but &s;till at a great di&s;tance, we de&s;cried the high &s;ummit of the mountain, rear|ing its tremendous head, and vomiting out torrents of &s;moke. It indeed appeared altogether inacce&s;&s;able, from the va&s;t extent of the fields of &s;now and ice that &s;urround it. Our diffidence was &s;till encrea&s;ed by the &s;entiments of the Cyclops. He told us that it often happened that the &s;urface of the mountain being hot below, melted the &s;now in particular &s;pots, and form|ed
<PB N="261" REF="031692_0261_0FEF2970AE433360">
pools of water, where it was impo&s;&s;ible to fore&s;ee our danger; that it likewi&s;e happened, that the &s;ur|face of the water, as well as the &s;now, was &s;ometimes covered with black a&s;hes, that rendered it exceedingly deceitful; that, however, if we thought proper, he would lead us on with as much caution as po&s;&s;ible. Accordingly; after holding a council of war, which people generally do when they are very much afraid, we detached our cavalry to the fore&s;t below, and pre|pared to climb the &s;now. The Cyclops, after taking a great draught of brandy, de&s;ired us to be of good cheer; that we had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of time, and might take as many re&s;ts as we plea&s;ed; that the &s;now could be lit|tle more than &s;even miles, and that we certainly &s;hould be able to pa&s;s it before &s;un-ri&s;e. Accordingly, taking each of us a dram of liqueur, which &s;oon removed ev|ery objection, we began our march.</P>

After incredible labour and fatigue, but at the &s;ame time mixed with a great deal of plea&s;ure, we arrived before dawn at the ruins of an ancient &s;tructure, called <HI>Il Tor|re del Filo&s;efo,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed to have been built by the phi|lo&s;opher Empedocles, who took up his habitation here, the better to &s;tudy the nature of Mount AEtna.

Here we re&s;ted our|&s;elves for &s;ome time, and made a fre&s;h application to our liqueur bottle, which I am per&s;uaded both Vulcan and Empedocles, had they been here, would have great|ly approved of after &s;uch a march.</P>
<P>I found the mercury had fallen to 20. 6. We had now time to pay our adorations in a &s;ilent contempla|tion of the &s;ublime objects of nature. The &s;ky was clear, and the immen&s;e vault of the heavens appeared in awful maje&s;ty and &s;plendour. We found our&s;elves more &s;truck with veneration than below, and at fir&s;t were at a lo&s;s to know the cau&s;e; till we ob&s;erv|ed

with a&s;toni&s;hment, that the number of &s;tars &s;eemed to-be infinitely increa&s;ed, and the light of each of them appeared brighter than u&s;ual. The white|ne&s;s of the milky way was like a pure flame that &s;hot acro&s;s the heavens; and with the naked eye we could ob&s;erve clu&s;ters of &s;tars that were invi&s;ible in the regions below. We did not at fir&s;t attend to the cau&s;e, nor recollect that we had now pa&s;&s;ed through ten or twelve thou&s;and feet of gro&s;s vapour, that blunts and confu&s;es every ray, before it reaches the &s;urface of the earth. We were amazed at the di&s;tinctne&s;s of vi|&s;ion, and exclaimed together, What a glorious &s;ituation for an ob&s;ervatory! Had Empedocles had the eyes of Galileo, what di&s;coveries mu&s;t he not have made! We regretted that Jupiter was not vi&s;ible, as I am per&s;ua|ded we might have di&s;covered &s;ome of his &s;atellites with the naked eye, or at lea&s;t with a &s;mall gla&s;s, which I had in my pocket.

We likewi&s;e took notice of &s;everal of tho&s;e meteors, called <HI>Falling Stars,</HI> which &s;till appeared to be as much elevated above us, as when &s;een from the plain; &s;o that in all probability, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e bodies move in regions much beyond the bounds that &s;ome philo&s;ophers have a&s;&s;igned to our atmo&s;phere.</P>

After contemplating the&s;e objects for &s;ome time, we &s;et off, and &s;oon after arrived at the foot of the great crater of the mountain. This is of an exact conical fig|ure, and ri&s;es equally on all &s;ides. It is compo&s;ed &s;ole|ly of a&s;hes and other burnt materials, di&s;charged from the mouth of the volcano, which is in its centre. This conical mountain is of a very great &s;ize. Its circum|ference cannot be le&s;s than ten miles. Here we took a &s;econd re&s;t, as the greate&s;t part of our fatigue &s;till re|mained. The mercury had fallen to 20 4&frac12; We found this mountain exce&s;&s;ively &s;teep; and although it had appeared black, yet it was likewi&s;e covered with &s;now; but the &s;urface (luckily for us) was &s;pread over with a pretty thick layer of a&s;hes, thrown out from the crater. Had it not been for this, we never &s;hould have been a|ble to get to the top, as the &s;now was every where fro|zen hard and &s;olid from the piercing cold of the air.</P>
<P>In about an hour's climbing, we arrived at a place where there was no &s;now, and where a warm and com|fortable vapour i&s;&s;ued from the mountain, which indu|ced us to make another halt.

But here de&s;cription mu&s;t ever fall &s;hort; for no im|agination has dared to form an idea of &s;o glorious and &s;o magnificent a &s;cene.

The &s;cene &s;till enlarges, and the horizon &s;eems to widen and expand it&s;elf on all &s;ides; till the &s;un, like the great Creator, appears in the ea&s;t, and with his pla&s;tic ray completes the mighty &s;cene.&mdash;All ap|pears enchantment, and it is with difficulty we can be|lieve we are &s;till on earth.

The circumference of the vi&s;ible horizon on the top of AEtna, cannot be le&s;s than 2000 miles. At Malta, which is near 200 miles di&s;tant, they perceive all the eruptions from the &s;e|cond

region, and that i&s;land is often di&s;covered from about one half the elevation of the mountain; &s;o that at the whole elevation, the horizon mu&s;t extend to near dou|ble that di&s;tance, or 400 miles, which makes 800 for the diameter of the circle, and 2400 for the circumfer|ence. But this is by much too va&s;t for our &s;en&s;es, not intended to gra&s;p &s;o boundle&s;s a &s;cene.</P>
<P>I find indeed, by &s;ome of the Sicilian authors, par|ticularly, Ma&s;&s;a, that the African coa&s;t as well as that of Naples, with many of its i&s;lands, have been di&s;cov|ered from the top of AEtna. Of this, however, we can|not boa&s;t, though we can very well believe it. Indeed, if we knew the heighth of the mountain, it would be ea&s;y to calculate the extent of its vi&s;ible horizon, and (<HI>vice ver&s;a</HI>) if its vi&s;ible horizon were exactly a&s;certain|ed, it would be an ea&s;y matter to calculate the heighth of the mountain.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t beautiful part of the &s;cene is certainly the mountain it&s;elf; the i&s;land of Sicily, and the nu|merous i&s;lands lying round it. All the&s;e, by a kind of magic in vi&s;ion, that I am at a lo&s;s to account for, &s;eem as if they were brought clo&s;e round the &s;kirts of AEtna, the di&s;tances appearing reduced to nothing. Per|haps this &s;ingular effect is produced by the rays of light pa&s;&s;ing from a rarer medium into a den&s;er, which (from a well-known law in optics) to an ob&s;erver in the rare medium, appears to lift up the objects that are
<PB N="268" REF="031692_0268_0FEF299A8B330120">
at the bottom of the den&s;e one, as a piece of money placed in a ba&s;on appears lifted up as &s;oon as the ba|&s;on is filled with water.</P>
<P>The <HI>Regione De&s;erta,</HI> or the frigid zone of AEtna, is the fir&s;t object that calls your attention. It is marked out by a circle of &s;now and ice, which extends on all &s;ides to the di&s;tance of about eight miles. In the cen|ter of this circle, the great crater of the mountain rears its burning head; and the regions of inten&s;e cold, and of inten&s;e heat, &s;eem for ever to be united in the &s;ame point. On the north &s;ide of the &s;nowy region, they a&s;&s;ure us there are &s;everal &s;mall lakes that are never thawed; and that in many places, the &s;now, mixed with the a&s;hes and &s;alts of the mountain, is accumu|lated to a va&s;t depth. And indeed I &s;uppo&s;e the quantity of &s;alts contained in this mountain is one great rea&s;on of the pre&s;ervation of its &s;nows.</P>
<P>The <HI>Regione De&s;erta</HI> is immediately &s;ucceeded by the <HI>Sylvo&s;a,</HI> or the woody region, which forms a circle or girdle of the mo&s;t beautiful green, which &s;urrounds the mountain on all &s;ides, and is certainly one of the mo&s;t delightful &s;pots on earth. This pre&s;ents a remark|able contra&s;t with the de&s;ert region. It is not &s;mooth and even like the greate&s;t part of the latter; but it is finely variegated by an infinite number of tho&s;e beau|tiful little mountains that have been formed by the dif|ferent eruptions of AEtna. All the&s;e have now acquir|ed a wonderful degree of fertility, except a very few
<PB N="269" REF="031692_0269_0FEF299C1E694740">
that are but newly formed; that is, within the&s;e five or &s;ix hundred years: for it certainly requires &s;ome thou&s;ands to bring them to their greate&s;t degree of perfection. We looked down into the craters of the&s;e, and attempt|ed, but in vain, to number them.</P>
<P>The circumference of this zone or great circle on AEtna, is not le&s;s than &s;eventy or eighty miles. It is evry where &s;ucceeded by the vineyards, orchards, and corn-fields that compo&s;e the <HI>Regione Culta,</HI> or the fertile region. This la&s;t zone is much broader than the oth|ers, and extends on all &s;ides to the foot of the moun|tain. Its whole circumference, according to Recupe|ro, is 183 miles. It is likewi&s;e covered with a number of little conical and &s;pherical mountains, and exhibits a wonderful variety of forms and colours, and makes a delightful contra&s;t with the other two regions. It is bounded by the &s;ea to the &s;outh and &s;outh-ea&s;t, and on all its other &s;ides by the river Semetus and Alcantara, which run almo&s;t round it. The whole cour&s;e of the&s;e rivers is &s;een at once, and all their beautiful wind|ing through the&s;e fertile valleys, looked upon as the fa|vourite po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Ceres her&s;elf, and the very &s;cene of the rape of her daughter Pro&s;erpine.</P>
<P>Ca&s;t your eyes a little farther, and you embrace the whole i&s;land, and &s;ee all its cities, rivers and moun|tains, delineated in the great chart of Nature: All the adjacent i&s;lands, the whole coa&s;t of Italy, as far as your
<PB N="270" REF="031692_0270_0FEF299DA5F099C8">
eye can reach; for it is no where bounded, but every where lo&s;t in the &s;pace. On the &s;un's fir&s;t ri&s;ing, the &s;hadow of the mountain extends acro&s;s the whole i&s;l|and, and makes a large tract vi&s;ible even in the &s;ea, and in the air. By degrees this is &s;hortened, and in a little time is confined only to the neighbourhood of AEtna.</P>
<P>We now had time to examine a fourth region of this wonderful mountain, very different indeed from the o|thers, and productive of very different &s;en&s;ations; but which has, undoubtedly, given being to all the re&s;t; I mean the region of fire.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent crater of this immen&s;e volcano is a cir|cle of about three miles and a half in circumference. It goes &s;helving down on each &s;ide, and forms a regular hol|low like a va&s;t amphitheatre. From many places of this &s;pace, i&s;&s;ue volumes of &s;ulphureous &s;moke, which be|ing much heavier than the circumambient air, in&s;tead of ri&s;ing in it, as &s;moke generally does, immediately on its getting out of the crater, rolls down the &s;ide of the mountain like a torrent, till coming to that part of the atmo&s;phere of the &s;ame &s;pecific gravity with it&s;elf, it &s;hoots off horizontally, and forms a large track in the air, according to the direction of the wind; which happily for us, carried it exactly to the &s;ide oppo&s;ite to that where we were placed.</P>
<P>The crater is &s;o hot, that it is very dangerous, if
<PB N="271" REF="031692_0271_0FEF299F2AA9EFA0">
not immoffible, to go down into it; be&s;ides the &s;moke is very incommodious, and, in many places, the &s;ur|face is &s;o &s;oft, there have been in&s;tances of people &s;ink|ing down in it, and paying for their temerity with their lives. Near the centre of the crater is the great mouth of the volcano: That tremendous gulph &s;o celebrated in all ages, looked upon as the terror and &s;courge both of this and another life; and equally u&s;eful to anci|ent poets, or to modern divines, when the Mu&s;e or when the Spirit in&s;pires. We beheld it with awe and with horror, and were not &s;urpri&s;ed that it had been con&s;idered as the place of the damned. When we re|flect on the immen&s;ity of its depth, the va&s;t cells and caverns whence &s;o many lavas have i&s;&s;ued; the force of its internal fire, to rai&s;e up tho&s;e lavas to &s;o va&s;t a heighth, to &s;upport them, as it were, in the air, and e|ven to force them over the very &s;ummit of the crater, with all their dreadful accompaniments; the boiling of the matter, the &s;haking of the mountain, the explo|&s;ions of flaming rocks, &amp;c. we mu&s;t allow, that the mo&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;tic imagination, in the mid&s;t of all its terrors, hardly ever formed an idea of a hell more dread|ful.</P>
<P>It was with a mixture both of plea&s;ure and pain, that we quitted this awful &s;cene. But the wind had ri&s;en very high, and clouds began to gather round the mountain. In a &s;hort time they formed like ano|ther
<PB N="272" REF="031692_0272_0FEF29A0B25331A8">
heaven below us, and we were in hopes of &s;eeing a thunder-&s;torm under our feet; A &s;cene that is not uncommon in the&s;e exalted regions, and which I have already &s;een on the top of the high Alps. But the clouds were &s;oon di&s;pelled again by the force of the wind, and we were di&s;appointed in our expectations.</P>
<P>I had often been told of the great effect produced by di&s;charging a gun on the top of high mountains. I tried it here, when we were a good deal &s;urpri&s;ed to find, that in&s;tead of increa&s;ing the &s;ound, it was almo&s;t reduced to nothing. The report was not equal to that of a pocket-pi&s;tol. We compared it to the &s;troke of a &s;tick on a door; and &s;urely it is con&s;i&s;tent with rea|&s;on, that the thinner the air is, the le&s;s its impre&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be on the ear; for in a vacuum there can be no noi&s;e; and the nearer the approach to a vacuum, the impre&s;|&s;ion mu&s;t always be the &s;maller. Where tho&s;e great effects have been produced, it mu&s;t have been among&s;t a number of mountains, where the &s;ound is reverbera|ted from one to the other.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XLII. OF THE DESCENT FROM MOUNT AETNA; OF ITS HEIGHTH AND OF THE ELEC|TRICITY OF THE AIR NEAR VOLCANOS.</HEAD>
<P>WE left the &s;ummit of the mountain about &s;ix o'|clock, and it was eight at night before we reached Ca|tania. We ob&s;erved, both with plea&s;ure and pain, the change of the climate as we de&s;cended. From the re|gions of the mo&s;t rigid winter, we &s;oon arrived at tho&s;e of the mo&s;t delightful &s;pring. On fir&s;t entering the fo|re&s;ts, the trees were &s;till bare as in December, not a &s;ingle leaf to be &s;een; but after we had a&s;cended a few miles, we found our&s;elves in the milde&s;t, and the &s;oft|e&s;t of climates; the trees in full verdure, and the fields covered with all the flowers of the &s;ummer; but as &s;oon as we got out of the woods, and entered the torrid zone, we found the heats, altogether in&s;upportable, and &s;uffered dreadfully from them before we reached the city.</P>
<P>On our arrival at Catania, we went immediately to bed, being exceedingly oppre&s;&s;ed by the fatigue of our expedition; but &s;till more by the violent heat of the day.</P>
<P>AEtnea has been often mea&s;ured, but I believe never with any degree of accuracy; and it is really a &s;hame
<PB N="274" REF="031692_0274_0FEF29AFA2FA9ED0">
to the &s;ociety e&s;tabli&s;hed in this place called the AEtne|an Academy, who&s;e original in&s;titution was to &s;tudy the nature and operations of this wonderful moun|tain. It was my full intention to have mea&s;ured it geometrically; but I am &s;orry to &s;ay, although this is both the &s;eat of an academy and univer&s;ity, yet there was no quadrant to be had. Of all the mountains I have ever &s;een, AEtna would be the ea&s;ie&s;t to mea&s;ure, and with the greate&s;t certainty, and perhaps the pro|pere&s;t place on the globe to e&s;tabli&s;h an exact rule of men&s;uration by the barometer. There is a beach of a va&s;t extent, that begins exactly at the foot of the mountain, and runs for a great many miles along the coa&s;t. The &s;ea-mark of this beach forms the meridian to the &s;ummit of the mountain. Here you are &s;ure of a perfect level, and may make the ba&s;e of your trian|gle of what length you plea&s;e. But unfortunately this men&s;uration has never been executed, at lea&s;t with any tolerable degree of deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>Kircher pretends to have mea&s;ured it, and to have found it 4000 French toi&s;es in heighth; which is more than any of the Andes, or indeed than any mountains upon earth. The Italian mathematicians are &s;till more ab&s;urd. Some of them make it eight miles, &s;ome &s;ix, and &s;ome four.</P>
<P>Amici, the la&s;t, and I believe the be&s;t who has made the attempt, reduces it to 3 miles, 264 paces; but even
<PB N="275" REF="031692_0275_0FEF29B128BE6B80">
this mu&s;t be exceedingly erroneous; and probably the perpendicular height of AEtna does not exceed 12,000 feet, or little more than two miles.</P>
<P>I own I did not believe we &s;hould find AEtna &s;o high as it really is. I had heard indeed that it was higher, than any of the Alps, but I never gave credit to it. How great then was my a&s;toni&s;hment to find that the mercury fell almo&s;t two inches lower than I had ever ob&s;erved it on the very highe&s;t of the acce&s;&s;ible Alps; at the &s;ame time I am per&s;uaded there are many inace&s;&s;ible points of the Alps, (particularly Mont Blanc) are &s;till much higher than AEtna.</P>
<P>The wind, and other circum&s;tances, in a great mea|&s;ure prevented our electrical experiments, on which we had built not a little; however I found that round Nicolo&s;i, and particularly on the top of Monpelieri, the air was in a very favourable &s;tate for electrical ope|rations. Here the little pith-balls, when in&s;olated, were &s;en&s;ibly affected, and repelled each other above an inch. I expected this electrical &s;tate of the air would have increa&s;ed as we advanced on the mountain; but at the cave where we &s;lept, I could ob&s;erve no &s;uch effect. Perhaps it was owing to the exhalations from the trees and vegetables, which are there exceedingly luxuriant; whereas about Nicolo&s;i, and round Monpelieri, there is hardly any thing but lava and dry hot &s;and. Or per|haps it might be owing to the evening being farther advanced, and the dews beginning to fall. However;
<PB N="276" REF="031692_0276_0FEF29BC038565D0">
I have no doubt, that upon the&s;e mountains formed by eruption, where the air is &s;trongly impregnated with &s;ulphureous effluvia, great electrical di&s;coveries might be made. And perhaps, of all the rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned for the wonderful vegetation that is performed on this mountain, there is none that contributes &s;o much tow|ards it, as this con&s;tant electrical &s;tate of the air. For, from a variety of experiments, it has been found, that an increa&s;e of the electrical matter adds much to the progre&s;s of vegetation. It probably acts there in the &s;ame manner as on the animal body. The circulation we know is performed quicker; and the juices are dri|ven through the &s;mall ve&s;&s;els with more ea&s;e and cele|rity. This has often been proved from the immediate removal of ob&s;tructions by electricity;&mdash;and probably the rubbing with dry and warm flannel, e&s;teemed &s;o ef|ficacious in &s;uch ca&s;es, is doing nothing more than ex|citing a greater degree of electricity in the part; but it has likewi&s;e been demon&s;trated, by the common ex|periment of making water drop through a &s;mall capil|lary &s;yphon, which the moment it is electrified runs in a full &s;tream. I have, indeed, very little doubt, that the fertility of our &s;ea&s;ons depend as much on this qua|lity in the air, as either on its heat or moi&s;ture.</P>
<P>Electricity will probably &s;oon be con&s;idered as the great vivifying principal of nature, by which &s;he car|ries on mo&s;t of her operations. It is a fifth element,
<PB N="277" REF="031692_0277_0FEF29C03091A7A0">
di&s;tinct from, and of &s;uperior nature to the other four, which only compo&s;e the corporeal parts of matter. But this &s;ubtile and active fluid is a kind of &s;oul that pervades and quickens every particle of it. When an equal quantity of this is diffu&s;ed through the air, and over the face of the earth, every thing continues calm and quiet; but if by any accident one part of matter has acquired a greater quantity than another, the mo&s;t dreadful con&s;equences often en&s;ue before the e|quilibrium can be re&s;tored. Nature &s;eems to fall into convul&s;ions, and many of her works are de&s;troyed:&mdash;All the great phaenomena are produced; thunder, light|ning, earthquakes, and whirlwinds: for, I believe, there is little doubt, that all the&s;e frequently depend on this &s;ole cau&s;e. And again, if we look down from the &s;ublime of nature to its minutiae, we &s;hall &s;till find the &s;ame power acting though perhaps in le&s;s legible cha|racters; for as the knowledge of its operations is &s;till le&s;s in its infancy, they are generally mi&s;under&s;tood, or a&s;cribed to &s;ome other cau&s;e. However, I have no doubt, that in proce&s;s of time the&s;e will be properly inve&s;tigated; when mankind will wonder how much they have been in the dark. It will then po&s;&s;ibly be found, that what we call &s;en&s;ibility of nerves, and ma|ny of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es that the faculty have as yet only invented names for, are owing to the body's being po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of too large or too &s;mall a quantity of this &s;ub|tile
<PB N="278" REF="031692_0278_0FEF29C1B45F45B8">
and active fluid, that very flued perhaps, which is the vehicle of all our feelings; and which they have &s;o long &s;earched for in vain in the nerves. For I have &s;ometimes been led to think, that this &s;en&s;e was noth|ing el&s;e than a &s;lighter kind of electric effect, to which the nerves &s;erve as conductors; and that it is by the rapid circulation of this penetrating and animating fire that our &s;en&s;ations are performed. We all know, that in damp and hazy weather, when it &s;eems to be blunted and ab&s;orbed by the humidity; when its activity is lo&s;t, and little or none of it can be collected; we ever find our &s;pirits more languid, and our &s;en&s;ibility le&s;s acute; but in the Sirecc wind at Naples, when the air &s;eems totally deprived of it, the whole &s;y&s;tem is un|&s;trung, and the nerves &s;eem to lo&s;e both their ten&s;ion and ela&s;ticity, till the north or we&s;t wind awakens the activity of this animating power, which &s;oon re&s;tores the tone, and enlivens all nature, which &s;eemed to droop and langui&s;h during its ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>It is likewi&s;e well known that there have been in|fluences of the human body becoming electric without the mediation of any electric &s;ub&s;tance, and even e|mitting &s;parks of fire with a di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation, and an extreme degree of nervous &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>About &s;even or eight years ago, a lady in Switzer|land was affected in this manner, and though I was not able to learn all the particulars of her ca&s;e, yet &s;e|veral
<PB N="279" REF="031692_0279_0FEF29C92557E020">
Swi&s;s gentlemen have confirmed to me the truth of the &s;tory. She was uncommonly &s;en&s;ible of every change of weather, and had her electrical feelings &s;tron|ge&s;t in a clear day, or during the pa&s;&s;age of thunder-clounds, when the air is known to be replete with that fluid. Her ca&s;e, like mo&s;t others which the doctors can make nothing of, was decided to be a <HI>nervous</HI> one; for the real meaning of that term I take to be only, that the phi&s;ician does not under&s;tand what it is.</P>
<P>Two gentlemen of Geneva had a &s;hort experience of the &s;ame &s;ort of complaint, though &s;till in a much &s;u|perior degree. Profe&s;&s;or Sau&s;&s;ure and young Mr. Jala|bert, when travelling over one of the high Alps, were caught among&s;t thunder clouds, and to their utter a&s;|toni&s;hment, found their bodies &s;o full of electrical fire, that &s;pontaneous fla&s;hes darted from their fingers with a crackling noi&s;e, and the &s;ame kind of &s;en&s;ation as when &s;trongly electrified by art. This was communi|cated by Mr. Jalabert to the Academy of Sciences at Paris, I think, in the year 1763; and you will find it recorded in their memoirs.</P>
<P>It &s;eems pretty evident, I think, that the&s;e feelings were owing to the bodies being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of too great a &s;hare of electric fire. This is an uncommon ca&s;e; but I do not think it at all improbable, that many of our invalids, particularly the hypochondriac, and tho&s;e we call <HI>Malades Imaginares,</HI> owe their di&s;agreeable feel|ings
<PB N="280" REF="031692_0280_0FEF29D12F009BA8">
to the oppo&s;ite cau&s;e, or the bodies being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of too &s;mall a quantity of this fire; for we find that a di|minution of it in the air &s;eldom fails to increa&s;e their unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations, and <HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI></P>
<P>Perhaps it might be of &s;ervice to the&s;e people to wear &s;ome electric &s;ub&s;tance next their &s;kin, to de|fend the nerves and fibres from the damp, or non-elec|tric air. I would propo&s;e a wai&s;tcoat of the fine&s;t flannel, which &s;hould be kept perfectly clean and dry; for the effluvia of the body, in ca&s;e of any violent per|&s;piration, will, &s;oon de&s;troy its electric quality. This &s;hould be covered by another of the &s;ame &s;ize of &s;ilk, the animal heat, and the friction that exerci&s;e mu&s;t occa&s;ion betwixt the&s;e two &s;ub&s;tances, produce a power|ful electricity; and would form a kind of electric at|mo&s;phere around the body, and might po&s;&s;ibly be one of the be&s;t pre&s;ervatives again&s;t the effect of damps.</P>
<P>As for our Swi&s;s lady, I have little doubt that her complaints were owing in great part, perhaps entirely, to her dre&s;s; and that a very &s;mall alteration, would effectually have cured her. A lady who has her head <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">rounded with wires, and her hair &s;tuck full of me|tal pins, and who at the &s;ame time &s;tands upon dry &s;ilk, is to all intents and purpo&s;es an electrical conduc|tor in&s;olated, and prepared for collecting the fire from the atmo&s;phere. And it is not at all &s;urpri&s;ing that during thunder&s;torms, or when the air is extremely re|plete
<PB N="281" REF="031692_0281_0FEF29D49F7A5980">
with electrical matter, &s;he would emit &s;parks, and exhibit other appearances of electricity. I ima|gine a very trifling change of dre&s;s, which from the con&s;tant ver&s;atility of their modes may &s;ome day take place, would render this lady's di&s;ea&s;e altogether epi|demical among&s;t the &s;ex. Only let the &s;oles of their &s;hoes be made of an electric &s;ub&s;tance, and let the wires of their caps, and pins of their hair, be &s;omewhat lengthened and pointed outwards; and I think there is little doubt, that they will often find them&s;elves in an electrified &s;tate. But, indeed, if they only wear &s;ilk, or even wor&s;ted &s;tockings, it may &s;ometimes prove &s;uffi|cient; for I have often in&s;olated electrometers as per|fectly by placing them on a piece of dry &s;ilk or flan|nel, as on gla&s;s.</P>
<P>How little do our ladies imagine, when they &s;ur|round their heads with wire, the mo&s;t powerful of all conductors; and at the &s;ame time wear &s;tockings, &s;hoes, and gowns of &s;ilk, one of the mo&s;t powerful re|pellents, that they prepare their bodies in the &s;ame manner, and according to the &s;ame principles as elec|tricians prepare their conductors for attracting the fire of lightning! If they cannot be brought to relinqui&s;h their wire caps and their pins, might they not fall up|on &s;ome &s;uch pre&s;ervative as tho&s;e which of late years have been applied to objects of le&s;s con&s;equence?</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e that every lady &s;hould provide her&s;elf with a
<PB N="282" REF="031692_0282_0FEF29D624B53B68">
&s;mall chain or wire, to be hooked on at plea&s;ure dur|ing thunder-&s;torms. This &s;hould pa&s;s from her cap over the thicke&s;t part of her hair, which will prevent the fire from being communicated to her head; and &s;o down to the ground. It is plain this will act in the &s;ame manner as the conductors on the tops of &s;teeples, which from the metal &s;pires that are commonly placed there, analagous to the pins and wires, were &s;o liable to accidents. Some people may laugh at all this; but I never was more &s;erious in my life. A very amia|ble lady of my acquaintance, Mrs. Douglas, of Kel&s;o, had almo&s;t lo&s;t her life by one of tho&s;e caps mounted on wire. She was &s;tanding at an open window during a thunder-&s;torm. The lightning was attracted by the wire, and the cap was burnt to a&s;hes; happily her hair was in its natural &s;tate, without powder, pomatum, or pins; and prevented the fire from being conducted to her head; for as &s;he felt no kind of &s;hock, it is proba|ble that it went off from the wires of the cap to the wall, clo&s;e to which &s;he then &s;tood. If it had found any conductor to carry it to her head or body, in all probability &s;he mu&s;t have been killed. A good &s;trong head of hair, if it is kept perfectly clean and dry, is probably one of the be&s;t pre&s;ervatives again&s;t the fire of lightning. But &s;o &s;oon as it is &s;tuffed full of powder and pomatum, and bound together with pins, its repel|lent force is lo&s;t, and it becomes a conductor.&mdash;But I

beg pardon for the&s;e &s;urmi&s;es. I throw them in the way of my readers only for them to improve upon at their lei&s;ure: For we have it ever in our power to be making experiments in electricity.

<HEAD>SECT. XLIII. OF MODERN ROME.</HEAD>
<P>A man, on his fir&s;t arrival at Rome, is not much fir|ed with its appearance. The narrowne&s;s of the &s;treets, the thinne&s;s of the inhabitants, the prodigious quanti|ty of monks and beggars, give but a gloomy a&s;pect to this renowned city. There are no rich trade&s;men here, who, by their acqui&s;itions, either ennoble their &s;ons, or marry their daughters into the hou&s;es of princes. All the &s;hops &s;eem empty, and the &s;hop-keepers poor. This is the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion. But turn your eye from that point of view to the magnificence of their church|es, to the venerable remains, of ancient Rome, to the prodigious collection of pictures and antique &s;tatues, to the very river and ground it&s;elf; formerly the habi|tation of that people, whom, from our cradles we have been taught to adore, and with a very few grains of en|thu&s;ia&s;m in your compo&s;ition, you will feel more than &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>The &s;urface of modern Rome is certainly more ele|vated
<PB N="285" REF="031692_0285_0FEF29EA78B0B200">
than it was in ancient times. Such an alteration mu&s;t happen, in the cour&s;e of ages, to every city which has been often de&s;troyed by time and fire, as all the rubbi&s;h is &s;eldom removed; but the ancient pavement, on which Trajan's pillars &s;tands, &s;hoes the elevation in that place not to be above &s;even or eight feet; and, I am informed, &s;ome of the triumphal arches are not a|bove three or four feet in the ground. The mo&s;t re|markable change is this; that the <HI>Campus Martius</HI> was in the time of the ancient Romans an open area, and now it is covered with hou&s;es. The circuit of the ci|ty, in Pliny's time, did not, by his account, exceed the pre&s;ent dimen&s;ions, but its populou&s;ne&s;s mu&s;t have been amazingly different.</P>
<P>Were an antiquarian to lament over any fall, any metamorpho&s;is of ancient Rome, perhaps it might be the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the Forum, where, now, there is e|very Thur&s;day and Friday, a market for cows and ox|en, on the very &s;pot where the Roman orators were accu&s;tomed to thunder out their eloquence in the cau&s;e of their clients, their country, and their gods. Accor|dingly, the Forum is now known by the name of <HI>Cam|po Vaccino.</HI></P>
<P>Surrounding the Forum are many ve&s;tiges of antique grandeur, triumphal arches, remains of temples, the ru|ins of the Imperial Palace, the Campidoglio, &amp;c. all be&s;peaking the magnificent &s;tate of Rome in the times
<PB N="286" REF="031692_0286_0FEF28349AB01F70">
of the Emperors. The great Amphitheatre, called al&s;o <HI>Il Colo&s;&s;eo,</HI> where the &s;pectacle of combats was exhib|ited, is al&s;o in its neighbourhood. In this place the &s;pirit of modern Rome &s;eems to prevail over that of ancient Rome; for where the wild bea&s;ts and gladia|tors formerly entertained &s;eventy or eighty thou&s;and &s;pectators, you now &s;ee a few mi&s;erable old women and beggars, who are praying at the feet of fourteen &s;mall chapels, which repre&s;ent the fourteen my&s;teries of our Saviour's pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The magnificence of the Roman Emperors, in em|belli&s;hing the city, ro&s;e to &s;uch a heighth, that they ran&s;acked all the quarries of Egypt for alaba&s;ter, gra|nite, porphyry, and every kind of marble that country afforded; and though time and Gothic rage mu&s;t have de&s;troyed great quantities, yet, &s;uch was the profu&s;ion brought to Rome, that, be&s;ides the amazing number of columns, &s;tatues, vales, and tables, &s;till pre&s;erved en|tire, you &s;ee the very po&s;ts in the &s;treets, all of them without exception, made of granite, alaba&s;ter, or mar|ble. But the mo&s;t &s;tupendous &s;ights of all, are the prodigious obeli&s;ks, con&s;i&s;ting of only one piece of marble. I meditate on the&s;e objects till I am lo&s;t in wonder and confu&s;ion. We have no idea of the me|chanical powers by which they were dug out of the quarry, and brought from Egypt. We are a&s;toni&s;hed at the enormous &s;ize of the &s;tones at <HI>Stonehenge,</HI> and
<PB N="287" REF="031692_0287_0FEF29EC034B5E58">
cannot comprehend by what contrivance they were carried and laid in that form; but the large&s;t of them is &s;mall, when compared with the large&s;t obeli&s;k at Rome, which I think is one hundred and one feet long, and proportionably thick.</P>
<P>The ruin of the triumphal bridge near St. Angelo is in object that cannot but &s;trike a man of letters. This was the bridge over which every general marched in|to the city, to whom a triumph was decreed, either for the conque&s;t of a province, or any other &s;ignal vic|tory. From the time of Romulus to that of the em|peror Probus, there were about three hundred and twenty of the&s;e triumphs. There are now only a few remains of the piers. Who can behold this &s;cene, without ruminaring on the nature of the human heart, and recollecting to what trials it mu&s;t have been expo|&s;ed in the cour&s;e of &s;o proud and &s;o flattering a pro|ce&s;&s;ion?</P>
<P>Many of the churches in this city, and above all St. Peter's, are &s;o very magnificent, that they vie with anci|ent Rome in every article but that of durablene&s;s, much of their beauty being derived from pictures, &s;tucco, and gilding, the tran&s;itory ornaments of two or three ages. I cannot forbear remarking, in this place, that the pride of modern Rome is one of the cau&s;es of her wretchedne&s;e. She boa&s;ts of her gold and &s;ilver lying dead in her churches; but had that gold and &s;ilver a

free circulation through the country; it would enliven trade, and furni&s;h property to thou&s;ands, who are now &s;tarving in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing indigence.</P>
<P>St. Peter's never fails to plea&s;e both the learned and the unlearned eye. The wonderful regularity and ad|ju&s;tment of its parts, like the beauty of a fine face, de|mand no &s;kill in drawing to ta&s;te its charms. Its colo|nades, fountains, and obeli&s;k, give it an inimitable ele|gance. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, however, that the ap|proach to this noble edifice is confined and &s;habby; but they now talk of demoli&s;hing the narrow mean &s;treet leading from St. Angelo; and &s;hould this de&s;ign take place, the avenue will be an&s;werable to the build|ing; though, to render St. Peter's church &s;till more per|fect, the Vatican, with its eleven thou&s;and chambers, &s;hould be removed, which like an ugly excre&s;cence, protuberates' on one &s;ide, and de&s;troys the &s;ymmetry of the elevation.</P>
<P>In the Vatican, be&s;ides a great number of Raphael's paintings, and the excellent and celebrated &s;tatues of the Belvedere Appollo, the Laocoon, and the Anti|nous. The Laocoon wants an arm. There lies on the ground one of marble, which, it is &s;aid, Michael Angelo had begun, in order to perfect the &s;tatue, but, perceiving how un&s;pirited his work would appear, compared with the original, he left the limb in the &s;tate we &s;ee it; not half executed, a monument of his mode&s;|ty

<P>IN their external deportment, the Italians have a grave &s;elemnity of manner, which is &s;ometimes thought to ari&s;e from a natural gloomine&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition. The French, above all other nations, are apt to impute to melancholy, the &s;edate &s;erious air which accompa|nies reflection.</P>
<P>Though in the pulpit, on the theatre, and even in common conver&s;ation, the Italians make u&s;e of a great deal of action; yet Italian vivacity is different from French; the former proceeds from &s;en&s;ibility, the lat|ter from animal &s;pirits.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this country have not the bri&s;k look, and ela&s;tic trip, which is univer&s;al in France: they move rather with a &s;low compo&s;ed pace.

to prefer the uncon&s;trained attitude of the Antinous, and other antique &s;tatues, to the artificial graces of a French dancing-ma&s;ter, or the erect &s;trut of a German &s;oldier. I imagine I perceive a great re&s;emblance be|tween many of the living countenances I &s;ee daily, and the features of the ancient bu&s;ts, and &s;tatues; which leads me to believe, that there are a greater number of the genuine de&s;cendants of the old Romans in Italy, than is generally imagined.</P>
<P>I am often &s;truck with the fine character of coun|tenance to be &s;een in the &s;treets of Rome. I never &s;aw features more expre&s;&s;ive of reflection, &s;en&s;e, and geni|us. In the very lowe&s;t ranks there are countenances which announce minds fit for the highe&s;t and mo&s;t im|portant &s;ituations; and we cannot help regretting, that tho&s;e to whom they belong, have not received an edu|cation adequate to the natural abilities we are convin|ced they po&s;&s;e&s;s, and been placed where the&s;e abilities could be brought into action.</P>
<P>Of all the countries in Europe, Switzerland is that, in which the beauties of nature appear in the greate&s;t variety or forms, and on the mo&s;t magnificent &s;cale. In that country, therefore, the young land&s;cape painter has the be&s;t chance of &s;eizing the mo&s;t &s;ublime ideas. But Italy is the be&s;t &s;chool for the hi&s;tory painter, not only on account of its being enriched with the works of the greate&s;t ma&s;ters, and the noble&s;t models of an|tique &s;culpture; but al&s;o on account of the fine expre&s;|&s;ive &s;tyle of the Italian countenance.</P>

Strangers, on their arrival at Rome, from no high idea of the beauty of the Roman women, from the &s;pecimens they &s;ee in the fa&s;hionable circles to which they are fir&s;t introduced. There are &s;ome exceptions; but in general it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that the pre|&s;ent race of women of high rank, are more di&s;tingui&s;h|ed by their other ornaments than by their beauty. Among the citizens, however, and the lower cla&s;&s;es, you frequently meet with the mo&s;t beautiful counte|nances. For a brilliant red and white, and all the charms of complexion, no women are equal to the En|gli&s;h. If a hundred, or any greater number, of Engli&s;h women were taken at random, and compared with the &s;ame number of the wives and daughters of the citizens of Rome, I am convinced, that ninety of the Engli&s;h would be found hand&s;omer than ninety of the Romans; but the probability is, that two or three in the hundred Italians, would have finer countenances than any of the Engli&s;h. Engli&s;h beauty is more remarkable in the country than in towns. The pea&s;antry of no country in Europe can &s;tand a compari&s;on, in point of looks, with tho&s;e of England. That race of people have the conveniencies of life in no other country in &s;uch per|fection; they are no where &s;o well fed, &s;o well defend|ed from the injuries of the &s;ea&s;ons, and no where el&s;e do they keep them&s;elves &s;o perfectly clean, and free from all the vilifying effects of dirt.

country girls, taken collectively, are unquestionably, the handsomest in the world. The female peasants of most other countries, indeed, are so hard worked, so ill fed, so much tanned by the sun, and so dirty, that it is difficult to know whether they have any beauty or not. Yet I have been informed, by some amateurs, since I came here, that, in spite of all these disadvanta|ges, they sometimes find among the Italian peasantry, countenances highly interesting, and which they prefer to all the cherry cheeks of Lancashire.</P>
<P>Beauty, doubtless, is infinitely varied; and happily for mankind, their tastes and opinions on the subject are equally various. Notwithstanding this variety, howev|er a style of face, in some measure peculiar to its own inhabitants, has been found to prevail in each differ|ent nation of Europe. This peculiar countenance is again varied, and marked with every degree of discri|mination between the extremes of beauty and ugliness. I will give you a sketch of the general style of the most beautiful female heads in this country, from which you may judge whether they are to your taste or not.</P>
<P>A great profusion of dark hair, which seems to en|croach upon the forehead, rendering it short and nar|row; the nose generally either aquiline, or continued in a straight line from the lower part of the brow; a full and short upper lip; (by the way nothing has a worse effect on a countenance, than a large interval be|tween the nose and month;) the eyes are large, and of

a &s;parkling black. The black eye certainly labours under one di&s;advantage, which is that from the iris and pupil being of the &s;ame colour, the contraction and dilatation of the latter is not &s;een, by which the eye is abridged of half its powers. Yet the Italian eye is won|derfully expre&s;&s;ive; &s;ome people think it &s;ays too much. The complexion, for the mo&s;t part, is of a clear brown, &s;ometimes fair, but very &s;eldom florid, or of that bright fairne&s;s which is common in England and Saxony. It mu&s;t be owned, that tho&s;e features which have a fine expre&s;&s;ion of &s;entiment and meaning in youth, are more apt than le&s;s expre&s;&s;ive faces, to be|come &s;oon &s;trong and ma&s;culine. In England and Germany, the women, a little advanced in life, retain the appearance of youth longer than in Italy.</P>

We mounted the fir&s;t a&s;&s;es that pre&s;ented them&s;elves for hire, and, attended by our Janizary, took the cour&s;e we per&s;ued ye&s;terday. We left the con|vent on our right, and pre&s;ently came among broken arches and long pavements, which are the remains of an aqueduct. Several towers reared up their di&s;mant|led heads on each &s;ide of us, who&s;e appearance pro|nounces them to have been po&s;ts of great importance and &s;trength.</P>
<P>A number of &s;tately pillars next engaged our atten|tion. They are placed in two parallel lines, and &s;eem to have formerly &s;upported &s;ome magnificent portico. The pillars are of granite, or Thebaic marble, and a|bout thirty feet high, of a &s;ingle &s;tone; and we count|ed no le&s;s than thirty of them &s;till &s;tanding. But how|ever choice the&s;e columns might be in any other place, they were but foils to the pillar which now appeared before us. We had been buried amid the ruins and the hills of &s;and which the winds have thrown up, when leaving the city by the gate of Ro&s;eto, we came unexpectedly upon the pillar. It is impo&s;&s;ible to tell which is mo&s;t worthy of admiration, the heighth, the workman&s;hip, or the condition of this pillar. By the be&s;t accounts we can obtain, it is an hundred and tent

feet high. The &s;haft, which is of a &s;ingle &s;tone of granite, is ninety feet, and the pede&s;tal is twenty feet more. It is of the Corinthian order, which gives a beautiful dignity to its &s;implicity, rarely to be met with in modern architecture. It has &s;uffered little or no in|jury from time. The poli&s;h upon the &s;haft has won|derfully with&s;tood the buffeting of the tempe&s;t; and it promi&s;es to hand down a patriot name to the late po&s;|terity of the ignorant native, who has no other trace of the fame of Pompey! The pede&s;tal has been &s;omewhat damaged by the in&s;truments of travellers, who are cu|rious to po&s;&s;e&s;s a relic of this antiquity; and one of the volutes of the column was immaturely brought down about four years ago, by a prank of &s;ome Engli&s;h cap|tains which is too ludicrous to pa&s;s over.</P>
<P>The jolly &s;ons of Neptune had been pu&s;hing about the cann on board one of the &s;hips in the harbour un|till a &s;trange freak entered into one of their brains. The eccentricity of the thought occa&s;ioned it immedi|ately to be adopted; and its apparent impo&s;&s;ibility was but a &s;pur for putting it into execution. The boat was or|dered, and with proper implements for the attempt, the&s;e enterpri&s;ing heroes pu&s;hed a &s;hore to drink a bowl of punch on the top of Pompey's Pillar! At the &s;pot they arrived, and many contrivances were propo&s;ed to accompli&s;h the de&s;ired point. But their labour was vain; and they began to de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s, when the
<PB N="296" REF="031692_0296_0FEF2A1DEF5E6760">
genius who &s;truck out the frolic, happily &s;ugge&s;ted the means of performing it. A man was di&s;patched to the city for a paper kite. The inhabitants were by this time apprized of what was going forward, and flocked in crouds to be witne&s;&s;es of the addre&s;s and boldne&s;s of the Engli&s;h. The Governor of Alexandria was told, that the&s;e &s;eamen were about to pull down Pompey's Pillar. But whether he gave them credit for their re|&s;pect to the Roman warrior, or to the Turki&s;h govern|ment, he left them to them&s;elves, and politely an&s;wered, that the Engli&s;h were too great patriots to injure the re|mains of Pompey.</P>
<P>He knew little, however, of the di&s;po&s;ition of the peo|ple who were engaged in this undertaking. Had the Turki&s;h empire ro&s;e in oppo&s;ition, it would not, per|haps, at that moment have detered them. The kite was brought, and flown &s;o directly over the pillar, that when it fell on the other &s;ide, the &s;tring lodged upon the cap|ital. The chief ob&s;tacle was now overcome. A two-inch rope was tied to one end of the &s;tring, and drawn over the pillar by the end to which the kite was affixed. By, this rope one of the &s;eamen a&s;cended to the top, and in le&s;s than an hour a kind of &s;hroud was con&s;tructed, by which the whole company went up, and drank their punch amid the &s;houts of the a&s;toni&s;hed multitude.</P>
<P>To the eye below, the capital of the pillar does not ap|pear capaple of holding more than one man upon it&mdash;
<PB N="297" REF="031692_0297_0FEF2A1F754F4B08">
but our &s;eamen found it could contain no le&s;s than eight per&s;ons very conveniently. It is a&s;toni&s;hing that no accident befel the&s;e mad-caps, in a &s;ituation &s;o ele|vated, as would have turned a landman giddy in his &s;o|ber &s;en&s;es. The only detriment which the pillar re|ceived, was the lo&s;s of the volute before mentioned, which came down with a thundering &s;ound, and was carried to England by one of the captains, as a pre|&s;ent to a lady who commi&s;&s;ioned him for a piece of the pillar. The di&s;covery which they made amply compen&s;ated for this mi&s;chief; as without their evi|dence the world would not have known at this hour, that there was originally a &s;tatue on this pillar, one foot and ancle of which are &s;till remaining. The &s;tatue was probably of Pompey him&s;elf; and mu&s;t have been of a gigantic &s;ize, to have appeared of a man's proportion at &s;o great a heighth.</P>
<P>There are circum&s;tances in this &s;tory which might give it an air of fiction, were it not demon&s;trated be|yond all doubt. Be&s;ides the te&s;timonies of many eye|witne&s;&s;es, the adventurers them&s;elves have left us a token of the fact, by the initials of their names, which are very legible in black paint, ju&s;t beneath the capital.</P>

<P>THE modern Per&s;ians are robu&s;t, warlike, and har|dy, and are now become all &s;oldiers.

<P>In their common di&s;cour&s;es they often introduce moral &s;entences, and poetical narrations, extracted from their poets and other writers.

very per&s;ons who play high, and con&s;ume their time in this polite idlene&s;s. The Per&s;ians &s;eem to fall into the contrary extreme. They delight in &s;itting &s;till and mu&s;ing. I never ob&s;erved any of them walk in their apartments as the Europeans, and particularly the En|gli&s;h, are u&s;ed to do.

<P>The per&s;ians are polite, but extravagantly hyperbol|ical in their compliments. This indeed is peculiar to the Ea&s;tern nations; and the &s;cripture, which partakes &s;o much of that &s;tyle, is known to be derived from that quarter. The per&s;ians were celebrated for a parti|cular genius to poetry, but war which has de&s;troyed their morals and learning, &s;eems al&s;o to have damped their poetic fire; though they have &s;till many traces of that fertility and &s;trength of imagination, for which in pa&s;t times they were de&s;ervedly famous. The ancient Per&s;ians are recorded to have taught their children a mo&s;t exact reverence for truth; but the pre&s;ent genera|tion are as notorious for fal&s;ehood. They poi&s;on with a &s;weet meat, in always &s;aying what is plea&s;ing, with|out regarding the truth. In their di&s;po&s;itions they are chearful, but rather inclined to &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s than loud mirth. In this they are not &s;o much the <HI>French</HI> of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> as in their politene&s;s and civility to &s;trangers. Ho&s;pi|tality

is a part of their religion. On occa&s;ions of the lea&s;t intercour&s;e, men of any di&s;tinction invite &s;tran|gers, as well as their friends, to their table; and it is re|markable how they pride them&s;elves in other te&s;timo|nies of re&s;pect.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ians, as well as the Turks, believe the Mo|&s;aic to have been the true religion before Chri&s;t, whom al&s;o they acknowledge to be a true prophet, and teach|er &s;ent from God; but that the religion he taught was contained in a book, which, at Mahomet's coming, was taken by the angel Gabriel into heaven, and the Koran brought down in its &s;tead. This however they do not attempt to prove. They &s;ay al&s;o, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t did not die upon the cro&s;s, but that another per|&s;on was miraculou&s;ly brought there in his place; thus confe&s;&s;ing the truth of our Saviour's mi&s;&s;ion, but con|founding it with ab&s;urd fables.</P>
<P>The common people pray at break of day, noon, and &s;un-&s;et. The MULLAH, or High-Prie&s;t, when he goes to prayers, mounts a turret appointed for that purpo&s;e, which over tops the hou&s;es; from whence at day|break, mid-day, and evening, he invokes the Supreme Being, by &s;aying, "O <HI>God,</HI> there is but one <HI>God, Ma|homet</HI> is his prophet, and <HI>Ali</HI> his friend." After repeat|ing the&s;e words three times, he makes a prayer to this effect: "Glory be to the Sovereign of the Univer&s;e, and to the Judge of the La&s;t Day. We glorify thee.
<PB N="302" REF="031692_0302_0FEE1BD3F4336F10">
We be&s;eech thee to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in our nece&s;&s;ities, to lead us in thy ways, and in the paths of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and to prevent our falling into the &s;nares of perdition."</P>
<P>I never ob&s;erved that the Per&s;ians have any marks of that fal&s;e mode&s;ty which prevails among Chri&s;tians of the be&s;t &s;ort, who, to avoid the imputation of affec|tation or hypocri&s;y, are as jealous to be &s;een on their knees, as afraid to commit any criminal action. If a bold ma&s;culine piety, and a &s;incere awful &s;en&s;e of the Deity are very con&s;i&s;tent things, this fal&s;e mode&s;ty mu&s;t be owing to an error in education.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ians have &s;ome of the Jewi&s;h rites among them; and al&s;o this peculiarity, that when they pray, they never permit the image of any &s;en&s;ible object to lie before them; nor is it permitted to pray with any thing of gold about them, as if it was e&s;teemed an ob|ject of idolatry. They invoke the interce&s;&s;ion of the departed &s;ouls of &s;ome of their prophets and pious men. They give one proof of religion va&s;tly &s;uperior to Chri|tians; for I never could ob&s;erve, that they mentioned the name of the Supreme Being except upon &s;olemn occa&s;ion; or at lea&s;t in a re&s;pectful manner.</P>
<P>The Turki&s;h language is the mo&s;t common in Per&s;ia. In matters of learning they u&s;e the Arabian language, in which is depo&s;ited the greate&s;t part of that know|ledge, for which the Per&s;ians, were once di&s;tingui&s;hed.

<HEAD>SECT. XLVII. OF THE MANNERS OF ORDERING SILK WORMS AT GHILAN IN PERSIA.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ilk worm, as it is well known, takes its birth from an egg no bigger than a &s;mall pin's head. In the month of March, when the &s;un is already very warm, I ob&s;erved the pea&s;ants in Ghilan prepare to give life to the eggs, which they had pre&s;erved during the winter, carrying them for the mo&s;t part about them, in the warme&s;t part of their bodies, and particularly un|der their arms. In ten or more days, according to the heat it receives, it becomes a maggot, and begins to &s;eed. The &s;hrub mulberry-trees, which are annually
<PB N="304" REF="031692_0304_0FEE1BDC95BB7A00">
produce the mo&s;t tender and proper leaves for their food. In about forty days the worm arrives to its maturity, and winds it&s;elf by daily gradations into a pod of &s;ilk as big as a pigeon's egg.</P>
<P>When this egg is completely formed, which is u&s;ual|ly known by the &s;ilence of the worm within, they &s;uf|focate it by covering it with blankets, or by the heat of the &s;un; unle&s;s they wind off the &s;ilk immediately, for then warm water an&s;wers the &s;ame purpo&s;e. Some of them, however, mu&s;t be permitted to live and perfo|rate the pod; for when it breaks from its enclo&s;ure, it ca&s;ts its &s;eed or eggs, by means of which the genera|tion is pre&s;erved. From the pods thus perforated, the &s;ilk cannot be wound off as from the others, but being prepared by pounding, it is &s;pun off like cotton yarn. This &s;ilk we call <HI>kedge,</HI> the remains or refu&s;e of which is &s;o inferior, as to admit only of being milled and made into &s;ilk wadding.</P>

there one day on purpo&s;e to &s;ee them, and de&s;igning to go incognito, I hired a Turki&s;h coach. The&s;e <HI>voitures</HI> are not at all like ours, but much more covenient for the country, the heat being &s;o great that gla&s;&s;es would be very trouble&s;ome. They are made a good deal in the manner of the Dutch &s;tage-coaches, having wooden lattices painted and gilded, the in&s;ide being al&s;o painted with ba&s;kets and no&s;egays of flowers, intermixed com|monly with little poetical mottos. They are covered all over with &s;carlet cloth, lined with &s;ilk, and very often richly embroidered and fringed. This covering entirely hides the per&s;ons in them, but may be thrown back at plea&s;ure, and thus permits the ladies to peep through the lattices. They hold four people very con|veniently, &s;eated on cu&s;hions, but not rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>In one of tho&s;e covered waggons I went to the bath|ing hou&s;e about ten o'clock. It was already full of wo|men. It is built of &s;tone, in the &s;hape of a dome, with no windows but in the roof, which gives light enough. There were five of the&s;e domes joined together, the outmo&s;t being le&s;s than the re&s;t, and &s;erving only as a hall, where the portre&s;s &s;tood at the door. Ladies of quality generally give this woman a crown or ten &s;hil|lings; and I did not forget that ceremony. There were four fountains of cold water in this room, falling fir&s;t into marble ba&s;ons, and then running on the floor in little channels made for that purpo&s;e, which carried
<PB N="306" REF="031692_0306_0FEE1BE18C0AC768">

The two other domes were the hot baths, one of which had cocks of cold water turning into it, to tem|per it to what degree of warmth the bather plea&s;ed to have.</P>
<P>I was in my travelling habit, which is a riding dre&s;s, and certainly appeared very extraordinary to them. Yet there was not one of them that &s;howed the lea&s;t &s;ur|pri&s;e or impertinent, curio&s;ity, but received me with all the obliging civility po&s;&s;ible. I know no European court where the ladies would have behaved them&s;elves in &s;o polite a manner to &s;uch a &s;tranger. I believe, up|on the whole, there were two hundred women, and yet none of tho&s;e di&s;dainful &s;miles, and &s;atirical whi&s;|pers, that never fail in our a&s;&s;emblies, when any body appears that is not dre&s;&s;ed exactly in the fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;ofas were covered with cu&s;hions and rich carpets, on which &s;at the ladies; and on the &s;econd their &s;laves behind them, but without any di&s;tinction of rank by their dre&s;s, all being in the &s;tate of nature. Yet there was not the lea&s;t wanton &s;mile or immode&s;t ge&s;ture among&s;t them.</P>
<P>They generally take this diver&s;ion once a weak, and &s;tay there at lea&s;t four or five hours, without getting

cold by immediatly coming out of the hot bath into the cool room, which was very &s;urpri&s;ing to me.</P>
<P>The lady that &s;eemed the mo&s;t con&s;iderable among&s;t, them intreated me to &s;it by her, and would fain have undre&s;&s;ed me for the bath. I excu&s;ed my&s;elf with &s;ome difficulty. They being, however, all &s;o earne&s;t in per|&s;uading me, I was at la&s;t forced to open my &s;hirt and &s;how them my &s;tays; which &s;atisfied them very well; for I &s;aw they believed I was locked up in that ma|chine, and that it was not in my own power to open it; which contrivance they attributed to my hu&s;band.

None of our harmle&s;s calling names! but when a min|i&s;ter here diplea&s;es the people, in three hours time he is dragged even from his ma&s;ter's arms.

This is the ble&s;&s;ed condition of the mo&s;t ab&s;olute monarch upon earth, who owns no law but his will.</P>
<P>I cannot help wi&s;hing, in the loyalty of my heart, that the parliament would &s;end hither a &s;hip-load of your pa&s;&s;ive obedient men, that they might &s;ee arbitra|ry government in its cleare&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t light, where it is hard to judge whether the prince, people, or min|i&s;ters are mo&s;t mi&s;erable.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. L. OF THE PERSONS AND MANNERS OF THE TURKISH LADIES.</HEAD>
<P>IN this country it is &s;urpri&s;ing to &s;ee a young wo|man that is not very hand&s;ome. They have naturally the mo&s;t beautiful complexion in the world, and gene|rally large black eyes: I can with great truth a&s;&s;ert, that the court of England (though I believe it the faire&s;t in Chri&s;tendom) does not contain &s;o many beau|ties as are under our protection here. They generally &s;hape their eye-brows, and both Greeks and Turks have the cu&s;tom of putting round their eyes a black tincture, that at a di&s;tance, or by candle-light, adds very much to the blackne&s;s of them. I fancy many of our ladies would be over-joyed to know this &s;ecret; but it is too vi&s;ible by day. They dye their nails a ro&s;e colour: but I own I cannot enough accu&s;tom my&s;elf to this fa&s;hion to find any beauty in it.</P>
<P>Their hair hangs at its full length behind, divided into tre&s;&s;es, braided with pearl or ribbon, which is al|ways
<PB N="311" REF="031692_0311_0FEE1BF4241EBC10">
in great quantity. I never &s;aw in my life &s;o ma|ny fine heads of hair. In one lady's I have counted one hundred and ten of the tre&s;&s;es all natural; but it mu&s;t be owned that every kind of beauty is more common here than with us.</P>
<P>The head-dre&s;s is compo&s;ed of a cap called <HI>talpock,</HI> which is in winter of fine velvet embroidered with pearls or diamonds, and in &s;ummer, of a light &s;hining &s;ilver &s;tuff. This is fixed on one &s;ide of the head, hang|ing a little way down, with a gold ta&s;&s;el, and bound on either &s;ide with a circle of diamonds, or a rich embroi|dered handkerchief. On the other &s;ide of the head the hair is laid flat; and here the ladies are at liberty to &s;how their fancies, &s;ome putting flowers, others a plume of heron's feathers, and, in &s;hort, what they plea&s;e; but the mo&s;t general fa&s;hion is a large bouquet of jewels, made like natural flowers, that is, the buds of pearl, the ro&s;es of different coloured rubies, the je&s;&s;a|mins of diamonds, and the jonquils of topazes, &s;o well let and enamelled, that it is hard to imagine any thing of the kind &s;o beautiful.</P>
<P>As to their morality, or good conduct, I can &s;ay, like Harlequin, that it is ju&s;t as it is with you; and the Turki&s;h ladies do not commit one &s;in the le&s;s for not being Chri&s;tians. Now, that I am a little acquaint|ed with their ways, I cannot forbear admiring either the examplary di&s;cretion, or extreme &s;tupidity, of all
<PB N="312" REF="031692_0312_0FEE1BF5AC7F1148">
the writers that have given accounts of them. It is ve|ry ea&s;y to &s;ee they have in reality more liberty than we have. No woman, of what rank &s;oever, is per|mitted to go into the &s;treets without two <HI>murlins,</HI> one that covers her face all but her eyes, and another that hides the whole dre&s;s of her head, and hangs half way down her back. Their &s;hapes are al&s;o wholly con|cealed by a thing they call a <HI>ferigee,</HI> which no woman of any &s;ort appears without. This has &s;trait &s;leeves that reach to their finger-ends, and it laps all round them, not unlike a riding-hood. In winter it is of cloth, and in &s;ummer, of plain &s;tuff or &s;ilk. You may gue&s;s then how effectually this di&s;gui&s;es them; &s;o that there is no di&s;tingui&s;hing the great lady from her &s;lave. It is im|po&s;&s;ible for the mo&s;t jealous hu&s;band to know his wife when he meets her, and no man dare touch or follow a woman in the &s;treet.</P>
<P>This perpetual ma&s;querade gives them entire liberty of following their inclinations without danger of di&s;co|very. The great ladies &s;eldom let their gallants know who they are! and it is &s;o difficult to find it out that they can very &s;eldom gue&s;s at her name, whom they have corre&s;ponded with for above half a year together. You may ea&s;ily imagine the number of faithful wives very &s;mall in a country, where they have nothing to fear from a lover's indi&s;cretion, &s;ince we &s;ee &s;o many have the courage to expo&s;e them&s;elves to that in this
<PB N="313" REF="031692_0313_0FEE1BF733FCB740">
world, and all the threatened puni&s;hment in the next, which is never preached to the Turki&s;h dam&s;els. Nei|ther have they much to apprehend from the re&s;entment of their hu&s;bands; tho&s;e ladies that are rich having all the money in their own hands.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I look upon the Turki&s;h women as the only free people in the empire. The very divan pays re&s;pect to them; and the Grand Signior him&s;elf, when a ba&s;&s;a is executed, never violates the privileges of the harem, or women's apartment, which remains un&s;earched and entire to the widow. They are queens of their &s;laves, whom the hu&s;band has no permi&s;&s;ion &s;o much as to look upon, except it be an old woman or two that his lady chu&s;es. It is true, their law permits them four wives; but there is no in&s;tance of a man of quality that makes u&s;e of this liberty, or of a woman of rank that would &s;uffer it.</P>
<P>Thus you &s;ee the manners of mankind do not differ &s;o widely as our voyage writers would make us believe. Perhaps it would be more entertaining to add a few &s;urpri&s;ing cu&s;toms of my own invention; but nothing &s;eems to me &s;o agreeable as truth, and I believe nothing &s;o acceptable to you.</P>

<P>Mr. Addi&s;on might here make the experiment he &s;peaks of in his travels, there not being one in&s;trument of mu&s;ic among the Greek or Roman &s;tatues, that is not to be found in the hands of the people of this coun|try. The young lads generally divert them&s;elves with making garlands for their favourite lambs, which I have often &s;een painted and adorned with flowers, lying at their feet while they &s;ung or played. It is not that they ever read romances; but the&s;e are the ancient amu&s;e|ments here, and as natural to them, as cudgel-playing and foot-ball to our Briti&s;h &s;wains, the &s;oftne&s;s and warmth of the climate forbidding all rough exerci&s;es, which were never &s;o much as heard of among&s;t them, and naturally in&s;piring a lazine&s;s and aver&s;ion for la|bour, which the great plenty indulges. The&s;e garden|ers are the only happy race of country people in Tur|key. They furni&s;h all the city with fruits and herbs, and &s;eem to live very ea&s;ily. They are mo&s;t of them Greeks, and have little hou&s;es in the mid&s;t of their gar|dens, where their wives and daughters take a liberty not permitted in the town, I mean, to go unveiled.

<HEAD>SECT. LII. OF THE ENTERTAINMENT GIVEN BY THE GRAND VIZIER'S LADY.</HEAD>
<P>AT Adrianople I was invited to dine with the Grand Vizier's lady, and it was with a great deal of plea&s;ure I prepared my&s;elf for an entertainment, which was ne|ver before given to any Chri&s;tian. I thought I &s;hould very little &s;atisfy her curio&s;ity, (which I did not doubt was a con&s;iderable motive to the invitation,) by going in a dre&s;s &s;he was u&s;ed to &s;ee, and therefore dre&s;&s;ed my|&s;elf in the court-habit of Vienna, which is much more magnificent than ours. However, I cho&s;e to go <HI>incog|nito,</HI> to avoid any di&s;putes about ceremony, and went in a Turki&s;h coach, attended only by my woman that held up my train, and the Greek lady who was my in|terprete&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="031692_0318_0FEE1C09E32DD430">
I was met at the court-door by her black eunuch, who helped me out of the coach with great re&s;pect, and conducted me through &s;everal rooms, where her female &s;laves, finely dre&s;&s;ed, were ranged on each &s;ide. In the innermo&s;t I found the lady &s;itting on her &s;ofa, in a &s;a|ble ve&s;t. She advanced to meet me, and introduced me to half a dozen of her friends with great civility. She &s;eemed a very good woman, near fifty years old. I was &s;urpri&s;ed to ob&s;erve &s;o little magnificence in her hou&s;e, the furniture being all very moderate, and except the habits and number of her &s;laves nothing about her appeared expen&s;ive. She gue&s;&s;ed at my thoughts, and told me &s;he was no longer of an age to &s;pend either her time or money in &s;uperfluities; that her whole expen&s;e was in charity, and her whole employment praying to God. There was no affectation in this &s;peech. Both &s;he and her hu&s;band are entirely given up to devotion. He never looks upon any other woman, and what is much more extraordinary, touches no bribes, notwith|&s;tanding the example of all his predece&s;&s;ors. He is &s;o &s;crupulous on this point, he would not except Mr. W&mdash;'s pre&s;ent, till he had been a&s;&s;ured over and over, that it was a &s;ettled perqui&s;ite of his place at the en|trance of every amba&s;&s;ador. She entertained me with all kind of civility till dinner came in, which was &s;erved one di&s;h at a time, to a va&s;t number, all finely dre&s;&s;ed after their manner, which I do not think &s;o bad, as it has been &s;ometimes repre&s;ented.</P>

I am a very good judge of their eating, having lived three weeks in the hou&s;e of an <HI>effendi</HI> at Belgrade who gave us very magnificent dinners, dre&s;&s;ed by his own cooks. The fir&s;t week they plea&s;ed me extremely; but I own I then began to grow weary of their table, and de&s;ired our own cook might add a di&s;h or two after our manner. But I attribute this to cu&s;tom, and am very much inclined to believe, that an Indian, who had nev|er ta&s;ted of either, would prefer their cookery to ours. Their &s;auces are very high, and all the roa&s;t very much done. They u&s;e a great deal of very rich &s;pice. The &s;oup is &s;erved for the la&s;t di&s;h, and they have at lea&s;t as great a variety of ragouts as we have. I was very &s;orry I could not eat of as many as the good lady would have had me, who was very earne&s;t in &s;erving me of every thing. The treat concluded with coffee and perfumes, which is a high mark of re&s;pect; two &s;laves kneeling, perfumed my hair, clothes, and hand|kerchief. After this ceremony &s;he commanded her &s;laves to play and dance, which they did with their guitars in their hands; and &s;he excu&s;ed to me their want of &s;kill, &s;aying &s;he took no care to accompli&s;h them in that art, I returned her thanks, and &s;oon after took my leave.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. LIII. OF CONSTANTINOPLE.</HEAD>
<P>I HAD the advantage of very fine weather all my journey from Adrianople to this city. The Grand Sig|nior furni&s;hed us with thirty covered waggons for our baggage, and five coaches of the country for my women. We found the road full of the great &s;aphis, and their e|quipages, coming out of A&s;ia to the war. They al|ways travel with tents; but I cho&s;e to lie in hou&s;es all the way. I will not trouble you with the names of the villages we pa&s;&s;ed, in which there was nothing remark|able but at Ciorlei, where there was a little &s;eraglio, built for the u&s;e of the Grand Signior when he goes this road. I had the curio&s;ity to view all the apartments de&s;tined for the ladies of his court. They were in the mid&s;t of a thick grove of trees made fre&s;h by fountains. But I was mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee the walls almo&s;t cover|ed with little di&s;tichs of Turki&s;h ver&s;e, written with pencils. I made my interpreter explain them to me, and I found &s;everal of them very well turned; though I ea&s;ily believed him, that they had lo&s;t much of their beauty in the tran&s;lation. One was literally thus in En|gli&s;h:
<Q><L>We come into this world, we ledge, and we depart;</L>
<L>He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> heart.</L></Q></P>
<P>The re&s;t of our journey was through fine painted

meadows, by the &s;ide of the &s;ea of Marmora, the anci|ent Propontis.</P>
<P>A certain French author &s;ays, Con&s;tantinople is twice as big as Paris. It does not appear to me to be much bigger than London; I am apt to think it is not &s;o populous. The burying-fields about it are certainly much larger than the whole city. It is &s;urpri&s;ing what a va&s;t deal of land is lo&s;t this way in Turkey. Some|times I have &s;een burying-places of &s;everal miles, be|longing to very incon&s;iderable villages, which were for|merly great towns, and retain no other mark of their ancient grandeur than this di&s;mal one.</P>
<P>On no occa&s;ion do they ever remove a &s;tone that &s;erves for a monument. Some of them are co&s;tly e|nough, being of very fine marble. They &s;et up a pillar, with a carved turbant on the top of it, to the memory of a man; and as the turbants, by their different &s;hapes, &s;how the quality or profe&s;&s;ion, it is in a manner putting up the arms of the decea&s;ed. Be&s;ides, the pillar com|monly bears an in&s;cription in gold letters. The ladies have a &s;imple pillar without other ornaments, except tho&s;e that die unmarried, who have a ro&s;e on the top of their monument. The &s;epulchres of particular fami|lies are railed in, and planted round with trees. Tho&s;e of the &s;ultans, and &s;ome great men, have lamps con|&s;tantly burning in them.</P>
<P>The exchanges are all noble buildings, full of fine
<PB N="322" REF="031692_0322_0FEE1C1758B97BA8">
alleys, the greate&s;t part &s;upported with pillars, and kept wonderfully neat. Every trade has its di&s;tinct alley, where the merchandi&s;e is di&s;po&s;ed in the &s;ame order, as in the New Exchange at London. The jeweller's quarter &s;hows &s;o much riches, &s;uch a va&s;t quantity of diamonds, and all kinds of precious &s;tones, that they dazzle the &s;ight. The embroiderer's is al&s;o very glittering, and people walk here as much for diver&s;ion as bu&s;ine&s;s. The markets are mo&s;t of them hand&s;ome &s;quares, ad|mirably well provided, perhaps better than in any oth|er part of the world.</P>
<P>I have taken care to &s;ee as much of the &s;eraglio here as is to be &s;een. It is on a point of land running into the &s;ea; a palace of prodigious extent, but very irregu|lar. The gardens take in a large compa&s;s of ground, full of high cypre&s;s-trees, which is all I know of them. The buildings are all of white &s;tone, leaded on the top, with gilded turrets and &s;pires, which look very magnificent; and, indeed, I believe there is no Chri&s;tian king's pa|lace half &s;o large. There are &s;ix large courts in it, all built round, and &s;et with trees, having galleries of &s;tone; one of the&s;e for the guard, another for the &s;laves, ano|ther for the officers of the kitchen, another for the &s;ta|bles, the fifth for the divan, and the &s;ixth for the apart|ment de&s;tined for audiences. On the ladies &s;ide there are at lea&s;t as many more, with di&s;tinct courts belong|ing to their eunuchs and attendants.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="031692_0323_0FEE1C18E049A000">
The climate about Con&s;tantinople, is delightful in the highe&s;t degree. I am now &s;itting, on the fourth of January, with the windows open, enjoying the warm &s;un-&s;hine, while you are freezing over a &s;ad &s;ea-coal fire; and my chamber is &s;et out with carnations, ro&s;es, and jonquils, fre&s;h from my garden.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ure of going in a barge to Chel&s;ea is not comparable to that of rowing upon the canal of the &s;ea here, where, for twenty miles together down the Bo&s;|phorus, the mo&s;t beautiful variety of pro&s;pects pre&s;ent them&s;elves. The A&s;iatic &s;ide is covered with fruit-trees, villages, and the mo&s;t delightful land&s;capes in nature. On the European &s;tands Con&s;tantinople, &s;itu|ated on &s;even hills. The unequal heights make it &s;eem twice as large at it is, (though one of the large&s;t cities in the world,) &s;howing an agreeable mixture of gardens, pine and cipre&s;s trees, palaces, mo&s;ques, and public buildings, rai&s;ed one above another with as much beau|ty, and appearance of &s;ymmetry, as any per&s;on ever &s;aw in a cabinet adorned by the mo&s;t &s;kilful hands, where jars &s;hew them&s;elves above jars, mixed with canni&s;ters, babies, and candle&s;ticks. This is a very odd compari|&s;on, but it gives me an exact ideal of the thing.</P>

<P>HAVING often heard Venice repre&s;ented as one of the mo&s;t defen&s;ible cities in the world, I took care to inform my&s;elf of the particulars in which its &s;trength con&s;i&s;ts. And the&s;e I find are chiefly owing to its ad|vantageous &s;ituation; for it has neither rocks nor fortifications near it, and yet is, perhaps, the mo&s;t im|pregnable town in Europe. It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> at lea&s;t four miles from any part of the <HI>Terra Firma;</HI> nor are the &s;hallows
<PB N="8" REF="031692_0331_0FEE1C2D73180078">
that h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> about it ever frozen hard enough to bring over an army from the land-&s;ide; the con&s;tant flux and re|flux of the &s;ea, or the natural mildne&s;s of the climate, hindering the ice from gathering to any thickne&s;s; which is an advantage the Hollanders want; when they have laid all their country under water.</P>
<P>On the &s;ide that is expo&s;ed to the Adriatic, the en|trance is &s;o difficult to hit, that they have marked it out with &s;everal &s;takes driven into the ground, which they would not fail to cut, upon the fir&s;t approach of an enemy's fleet. For this rea&s;on they have not for|tified the little i&s;lands, that lie at the entrance, to the be&s;t advantage, which might otherwi&s;e very ea&s;ily com|mand all the pa&s;&s;es that lead to the city from the A|driatic. Nor could an ordinary fleet with bomb-ve&s;&s;els, hope to &s;ucceed again&s;t a place that has always in its ar&s;enal a con&s;iderable number of gallies and men of war ready to put to &s;ea on a very &s;hort warning. If we could therefore &s;uppo&s;e them blocked up on all &s;ides, by a power too &s;trong for them, both by &s;ea and land, they would be able to defend them&s;elves again&s;t every thing but famine: and this would not be a little mitigated by the great quantities of fi&s;h that their &s;eas abound with, and that may be taken up in the mid&s;t of their very &s;treets; which is &s;uch a natural magazine as few other places can boa&s;t of.</P>
<P>The city &s;tands very convenient for commerce. It
<PB N="9" REF="031692_0332_0FEE1C2EFB1CA8F0">
has &s;everal navigable rivers that run up into the body of Italy, by which they might &s;upply a great many countries with fi&s;h and other commodities; not to men|tion their opportunities for the Levant, and each &s;ide of the Adriatic. But notwith&s;tanding the&s;e conve|niences, their trade is far from being in a flouri&s;hing condition for many rea&s;ons. The duties are great that are laid on merchandi&s;es. Their nobles think it be|low their quality to engage in traffic. Their merch|ants, who are grown rich, and able to manage great dealings, buy their nobility, and generally give over trade. Their manufactures of cloth, gla&s;s, and &s;ilk, formerly the be&s;t in Europe, are now excelled by tho&s;e of other countries. They are tenacious of old laws and cu&s;toms to their great prejudice; whereas a trading nation mu&s;t be &s;till for new changes and expe|dients, as different junctures and emergencies ari&s;e. The &s;tate is at pre&s;ent very &s;en&s;ible of this decay in their trade, and as a noble Venetian, who is &s;till a mer|chant, told me, they will &s;peedily find out &s;ome meth|od to redre&s;s it: po&s;&s;ibly by making a free port, for they look with an evil eye upon Leghorn, which draws to it mo&s;t of the ve&s;&s;els bound for Italy. They have hitherto been &s;o negligent in this particular, that many think the Great Duke's gold has had no &s;mall influence in their councils.</P>
<P>Venice has &s;everal particulars, which are not to be
<PB N="10" REF="031692_0333_0FEE1C325B241308">
found in other cities, and is therefore very entertaining to a traveller. It looks at a di&s;tance, like a great town half-floated by a deluge. There are canals &egrave;very where cro&s;&s;ing it, &s;o that one may go to mo&s;t hou&s;es either by land or by water. This is a very great con|venience to the inhabitants; for a gondola with two oars at Venice, is as magnificent as a coach and &s;ix hor&s;es with a large equipage, in another country; be&s;ides that it makes all other carriages extremely cheap. The &s;treets are generally paved with brick or free&s;tone, and always kept very neat; for there is no carriage, not &s;o much as a chair that pa&s;&s;es through them. There is an innumerable multitude of very hand&s;ome&mdash;bridges, all of a &s;ingle arch, and without any fence on either &s;ide, which would be a great inconvenience to a city le&s;s &s;ober than Venice. One would indeed wonder that drinking is &s;o little in vogue among the Venetians, who are in a moi&s;t air and a moderate climate, and have no &s;uch diver&s;ions as bowling, hunting, walking, riding, and the like exerci&s;es to employ them without doors. But as the nobles are not to conver&s;e too much with &s;trangers, they are in no danger of learning it; and they are generally too di&s;tru&s;tful of one another for the freedoms that are u&s;ed in &s;uch kind of conver&s;a|tion.</P>
<P>There are many noble palaces in Venice. Their furniture is not commonly very rich, if we except the
<PB N="11" REF="031692_0334_0FEE1C35B6FB7850">
pictures, which are here in greater plenty than in any other place in Europe, from the hands of the be&s;t ma&s;ters of the Lombard &s;chool; as Titian, Paul Ve|rone&s;e, and Tintoret. The la&s;t of the&s;e is in greater e&s;teem at Venice than in other parts of Italy.</P>
<P>The rooms are generally hung with gilt leather, which they cover on extraordinary occa&s;ions with ta|pe&s;try, and hangings of greater value. The flooring is a kind of red plai&s;ter made of brick ground to powder, and afterwards worked into mortar. It is rubbed with oil, and makes a &s;mooth, &s;hining, and beautiful &s;urface. The&s;e particulars are chiefly owing to the moi&s;ture of the air, which would have an ill effect on other kinds of furniture, as it &s;hows it&s;elf too vi&s;ibly in many of their fine&s;t pictures.</P>
<P>Though the Venetians are extremely jealous of any great fame or merit in a living member of their com|monwealth, they never fail of giving a man his due prai&s;es, when they are in no danger or &s;uffering from his ambition. For this rea&s;on; though there are a great many monuments erected to &s;uch as have been bene|factors to the republic, they are generally put up after their deaths. Among the many eulogiums that are giv|en to the Doge, Pi&s;auro, who had been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in England, his epitaph &s;ays, "In Angli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Regis obitum mir&acirc; calliditate celatum, mira&s;agacitale rima|tus, pri&s;can benevolentiam firmavit;" that is, "In En|gland,
<PB N="12" REF="031692_0335_0FEE1C391B8F2148">
having with wonderful &s;agacity di&s;covered the death of king James, which was kept &s;ecret with won|derful art, he confirmed the ancient friend&s;hip."</P>
<P>The particular palaces, churches, and pictures of Venice, are enumerated in &s;everal little books that may be bought in the place, and have been faithfully tran&s;|cribed by many voyage-writers. When I was at Ve|nice, they were putting out very curious &s;tamps of the &s;everal edifices, which are mo&s;t famous for their beau|ty or magnificence.</P>
<P>The ar&s;enal of Venice is an i&s;land of about three miles round. It contains all the &s;tores and provi&s;ions for war that are not actually employed. There are clocks for their gallies and men of war, mo&s;t of them full, as well as work-hou&s;es for all land and naval pre|parations. That part of it, where the arms are laid, makes a great &s;how, and was indeed very extraordinary about a hundred years ago; but at pre&s;ent a great part of its furniture is grown u&s;ele&s;s. There &s;eem to be almo&s;t as many &s;uits of armour as there are guns. The &s;words are old-fa&s;hioned and unweildy, and the fire-arms fit|ted with locks of little convenience, in compari&s;on of tho&s;e that are now in u&s;e. The Venetians pretend they could &s;et out, in ca&s;e of great nece&s;&s;ity, thirty men of war, a hundred gallies, and ten galea&s;&s;es, though I cannot conceive how they could man a fleet of half the number.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="031692_0336_0FEE1C3E4FF6E230">
It was certainly a mighty error in this &s;tate to effect &s;o many conque&s;ts on the <HI>Terra Firma,</HI> which has only &s;erved to rai&s;e the jealou&s;y of the Chri&s;tian princ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> and, about three hundred years ago, had like to have ended in the utter extirpation of the commonwealth; whereas had they applied them&s;elves, with the &s;ame politics and indu&s;try, to the increa&s;e of their &s;trength by &s;ea, they might perhaps have had all the i&s;lands of the Archipelago in their hands, and, by con&s;equence, the greate&s;t fleet, and the mo&s;t &s;eamen of any other &s;tate in Europe. Be&s;ides, that this would have given no jealou&s;y to the princes their neighbours, who would have enjoyed their own dominions in peace, and have been very well contented to have &s;een &s;o &s;trong a bul|wark again&s;t all the forces and inva&s;ions of the Otto|man empire.</P>
<P>The republic, however, will &s;till maintain it&s;elf, if policy can prevail upon force; for it is certain the Ve|netian &s;enate is one of the wi&s;e&s;t councils in the world, though at the &s;ame time, if we believe the reports of &s;everal that have been well ver&s;ed in their con&s;titution, a great part of their politics is founded on maxims, which others do not think con&s;i&s;tent with their hon|our to put in practice. The pre&s;ervation of the repub|lic is that to which all other con&s;iderations &s;ubmit. To encourge idlene&s;s and luxury in the nobility, to cheri&s;h ignorance and licentiou&s;ne&s;s in the clergy, to
<PB N="14" REF="031692_0337_0FEE1C3FD97190A8">
keep alive a continual faction in the common people, to connive at the viciou&s;ne&s;s and debauchery of con|vents, to breed di&s;&s;en&s;ions among the nobles of the <HI>Ter|ra Firma,</HI> to treat a brave man with &s;corn and infamy; in &s;hort, to &s;tick at nothing for the public intere&s;t, are repre&s;ented as the refined parts of the Venetian wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>Among all the in&s;tances of their politics, there is none more admirable than the great &s;ecrecy which reigns in their public councils. The &s;enate is gene|rally as numerous as our hou&s;e of commons, if we on|ly reckon the &s;itting members, and yet carries its re&s;o|lutions &s;o privately, that they are &s;eldom known till they di&s;cover them&s;elves in the execution. It is not many years &s;ince they had before them a great debate concerning the puni&s;hment of one of their admirals, which la&s;ted a month together, and concluded in his condemnation; yet was there none of his friends, nor of tho&s;e who had engaged warmly in his defence, that gave him the lea&s;t intimation of what was pa&s;&s;ing a|gain&s;t him, until he was actually &s;eized, and in the hands of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The carnival of Venice is every where talked of. The great diver&s;ion of the place at that time, as well as on all other high occa&s;ions, is ma&s;king. The Veneti|ans, who are naturally grave, love to give into the fol|lies and entertainments of &s;uch &s;ea&s;ons, when di&s;gui&s;ed in a fal&s;e per&s;onage. They are, indeed, under a nece&s;&s;ity
<PB N="15" REF="031692_0338_0FEE1C4161CF22D8">
of finding out diver&s;ions that may agree with the na|ture of the place, and make &s;ome amends for the lo&s;s of &s;everal plea&s;ures, which may be met with on the continent. The&s;e di&s;gui&s;es give occa&s;ion to abun|dance of love-adventures; for there is &s;omething more intriguing in the amours of Venice, than in tho&s;e of other countries; and I que&s;tion not but the &s;ecret hi&s;|tory of a carnival would make a collection of very di|verting novels.</P>
<P>Operas are another great entertainment of this &s;ea|&s;on: the Italian poets, be&s;ides the celebrated &s;mooth|ne&s;s of their tongue, have a particular advantage above the writers of other nations, in the difference of their poetical and pro&s;e language. There are indeed &s;ets of phra&s;es which in all countries are peculiar to the po|ets; but among the Italians there are not only &s;enten|ces, but a multitude of particular words, that never en|ter into common di&s;cour&s;e. They have &s;uch a differ|ent turn and poli&s;hing for poetical u&s;e, that they drop &s;everal of their letters, and appear in another form, when they come to be ranged in ver&s;e. For this rea|&s;on the Italian Opera &s;eldom &s;inks into poorne&s;s of language, but, amid&s;t all the meanne&s;s and familiarity of the thoughts, has &s;omething beautiful and &s;onorous in the expre&s;&s;ion. Without this natural advantage of the tongue, their pre&s;ent poetry would appear wretchedly low and vulgar, notwith&s;tanding the many
<PB N="16" REF="031692_0339_0FEE1C42EA427B40">
&s;trained allegories that are &s;o much in u&s;e among the writers of this nation. The Engli&s;h and French, who always u&s;e the &s;ame words in ver&s;e as in ordinary con|ver&s;ation, are forced to rai&s;e their language with meta|phors and figures, or by the pompou&s;ne&s;s of the whole phra&s;e, to wear off any littlene&s;s that appears in the particular parts which compo&s;e it. This makes our blank ver&s;e where there is no rhyme to &s;upport the ex|pre&s;&s;ion, extremely difficult to &s;uch as are not ma&s;ters in the tongue, e&s;pecially when they write on low &s;ub|jects; and it is probably for this rea&s;on that Milton has made u&s;e of &s;uch frequent tran&s;po&s;itions, latini&s;ms, antiquated words and phra&s;es, that he might the better deviate from vulgar and ordinary expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>There is a cu&s;tom at Venice, which they tell me is particular to the common people of this country, of &s;inging &s;tanzas out of Ta&s;&s;o. They are &s;et to a pretty &s;olemn time, and when one begins in any part of the poet, it is odd, but he will be an&s;wered by &s;omebody el&s;e that overhears him. So that &s;ometimes you have ten or a dozen in the neighbourhood of one another, taking ver&s;e after ve&s;e and running on with the poem as far as their memories will carry them.</P>
<P>On <HI>Holy Thur&s;day,</HI> among the &s;everal &s;hows that are yearly exhibited, I &s;aw one that is odd enough, and particular to the Venetians. There is a &s;et of arti&s;ans, who, by the help of &s;everal poles, which they lay acro&s;s

each others &s;houlders, build them&s;elves up into a kind of pyramid; &s;o that you &s;ee a pile of men in the air of four or five rows ri&s;ing one above another. The weight is &s;o equally di&s;tributed, that every man is very able to bear his part of it, the &s;tories, if I may &s;o call them, growing le&s;s and le&s;s as they advance higher and high|er. A little boy repre&s;ents the point of the pyramid, who, after a &s;hort &s;pace, leaps off, with a great deal of dexterity, into the arms of one that catches him at the bottom. In the &s;ame manner the whole building falls to pieces. I have been the more particular on this, be|cau&s;e it explains the following ver&s;es of Claudian, which &s;how that the Venetians are not the inventors of this trick.</P>

<SALUTE>My dear Frind,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU wi&s;h to have a ju&s;t and circum&s;tantial account of the late calamity we have &s;u&s;tained. It is no won|der the accounts you have &s;een &s;hould be incoherent and imperfect; for while the misfortune was recent, our minds were di&s;tracted with a thou&s;and fears and apprehen&s;ions for the con&s;equences: indeed, people le&s;s alarmed and le&s;s gloomy than our&s;elves might have admitted the apprehen&s;ion of pe&s;tilence and famine; the former, from the air being tainted from &s;ome thou|&s;ands of putrid carca&s;es both of men and cattle; and the latter from the country around us being de&s;troyed, as well as our &s;tock of provi&s;ions and the fruit of the earth.</P>
<P>From the 17th of May, it blew hard from the N. E. but as bad weather is unu&s;ual at &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on, we did not apprehend that it would become more &s;eri&oacute;us; but on the 19th at night it encrea&s;ed to a hard gale; and on the 20th, in the morning, it blew a perfect hurricane, in&s;omuch that our hou&s;es were pre&s;ently untiled, our
<PB N="19" REF="031692_0342_0FEE1C4EDB34DBE8">
doors and windows beat in, and the railing and part of the wall of our inclo&s;ures blown down. A little be|fore eleven it came with violence from the &s;ea, and I pre&s;ently perceived a multitude of the inhabitants crowding toward my hou&s;e, crying out that the &s;ea was coming in upon us. I ca&s;t my eyes in that direction, and &s;aw it approaching with great rapidity, bearing much the &s;ame appearance as the bar in Bengal river. As my hou&s;e was &s;ituated very low I did not he&s;itate to abandon it, directing my &s;teps towards the old Fac|tory, in order to avail my&s;elf of the Terrace; for in that dreadful moment I could not &s;o far reflect upon cau&s;es or effects, as to account for the phaenomenon, or to &s;et bounds to its increa&s;e. I had indeed heard of a tradition among the natives, that about a century ago the &s;ea ran as high as the talle&s;t Palmira trees, which I have ever di&s;regarded as fabulous, till the pre&s;ent un|u&s;ual appearance called it more forcibly to my mind. In my way to the old Factory, I &s;topped at the door of Mr. Boures' hou&s;e, to appri&s;e the re&s;t of the gentlemen of their danger, and the mea&s;ures I had concerted for my &s;afety. They accordingly joined me; but before we attained the place of our de&s;tination, we were nearly intercepted by the torrent of w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">. As the hou&s;e is built on a high &s;pot, and pretty well elevated from the ground, the water ran above a foot on the fir&s;t floor, &s;o we had no occa&s;ion to have recour&s;e to the Terrace.
<PB N="20" REF="031692_0343_0FEE1C5405ACA300">
Between one and two o'clock the water began to &s;ub|&s;ide a little, and continued gradually decrea&s;ing till the body of it had retired; leaving all the low places, tanks, and wells, full of &s;alt water. I think the &s;ea mu&s;t have ri&s;en fifteen feet above its natural level. About the time of the water &s;ub&s;iding, the wind favoured it by coming round to the &s;outhward, from which point it blew the harde&s;t. As the Factory-hou&s;e was in a very ruinous &s;tate, and &s;hook exceedingly at every gu&s;t, we were very anxious to get back to Mr. Boures' hou&s;e. I attempted it twice, but found I had neither power nor &s;trength to combat the force of the wind, getting back with the greate&s;t difficulty to my former &s;tation. About five o'clock during a &s;hort lull, we happily ef|fected our remove. It blew very hard the greate&s;t part of the night; at midnight it veered to the we&s;tward, and was &s;o cold, that I thought we &s;hould have peri&s;hed as we reclined in our chairs.</P>
<P>The gale broke up towards the morning. I &s;hall not attempt to de&s;cribe to you the &s;cene that pre&s;ented it|&s;elf to our view, when day-light appeared: it was drea|ry and horrid beyond de&s;cription. The trees were all blighted by the &s;alt water, and the face of the country covered with &s;alt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; yet it had more the appearance of having &s;uffered by a bla&s;t of wind, or by the erup|tion of volcanos, than by an inundation of water, &s;uch an effect had it in de&s;troying the herbage and foilage of
<PB N="21" REF="031692_0344_0FEE1C592F8F0898">
every de&s;cription. Our hou&s;es were found full of the inhabitants who had taken refuge therein, &s;tripped of doors and windows, and quite open to the weather at top; the go-downs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stairs at the backs of the hou&s;es to de&s;cend, in order to take water.</NOTE> mo&s;tly carried away and &s;everal &s;ub&s;tantial tiled hou&s;es &s;o complately leveled, as &s;carce|ly to afford a mark of their ever exi&s;ting; but our &s;uf|ferings were light, when compared with tho&s;e of <HI>Co|ringa,</HI> and the re&s;t of the villages nearer the &s;ea. At <HI>Coringa,</HI> out of four thou&s;and inhabitants, it is &s;aid not more than twenty were &s;aved, and tho&s;e mo&s;tly on Mrs. Cor&s;ar's Terrace, and on the beams of Captain Web|&s;ter's hou&s;e. Mr. Gideon Firth; Mr. George Day, and the Portugue&s;e Padr&eacute; were, I believe, the only Europe|ans that were drowned. At fir&s;t the &s;ea ro&s;e gradual|ly, and as it came in with the tide the people were not much alarmed; but when they found it &s;till en|crea&s;e &s;o as to render their &s;ituation dangerous, they mounted on the top of their Cadjan-hou&s;es, till the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> impelled by a &s;trong Ea&s;terly wind ru&s;hed in upon them mo&s;t furiou&s;ly, when all the hou&s;es at the &s;ame awful moment gave way, and nearly four thou&s;and &s;ouls were launched into eternity. This tremendous &s;cene was vi&s;ible from Mrs. Cor&s;ar's Terrace, over which the &s;ea &s;ometimes broke, and they were frequent|ly in great danger from the drifting of ve&s;&s;els and oth|er
<PB N="22" REF="031692_0345_0FEE1C5AB8151DE0">
heavy bodies, which mu&s;t inevitably have brought down the hou&s;e, had they come to contact. At the Dutch village of <HI>Jaggernaickporan,</HI> I hear the di&s;tre&s;s was very great, and that about a thou&s;and lives were lo&s;t; many of the villages in the low country between <HI>Coringa</HI> and <HI>Jaggernaickporan</HI> were totally de&s;troyed, and the inundation carried its dreadful effects as far to the northward as <HI>Apparah;</HI> but I do not hear that ma|ny lives were lo&s;t at that place. The inundation pene|trated inland about ten co&s;s from the &s;ea in a direct line; but did little more damage to the we&s;tward of us than de|&s;troying the vegetation. It would be very difficult to a&s;certain with any preci&s;ion, the number of lives lo&s;t in this dreadful vi&s;itation; the mo&s;t intelligent people I have conferred with on the &s;ubject, &s;tate the lo&s;s at from ten to twenty thou&s;and &s;ouls. This is rather an indefinite computation; but I think, if the medium be taken, it will then rather exceed than fall &s;hort of the real lo&s;s. They compute that a lack of cattle were drowned, and from the va&s;t numbers I &s;aw dead at <HI>Nellapilla,</HI> I can ea&s;ily credit their a&s;&s;ertion. For two or three days after the calimity, &s;uch was the languor of the inhabi|tants, not a Cooley or workman was to be procured at any price; it required our utmo&s;t exertion to get the dead bodies and the dead cattle buried with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed, to prevent the air being impregnated with putrid effluvia. This, to be &s;ure, was a ta&s;k we could not ful|ly

<P>When we had recovered from our con&s;ternation on the 21&s;t, we began to con&s;ider how we &s;hould be able to exi&s;t in &s;uch a field of de&s;olation, as our wells were filled with &s;alt water, our provi&s;ions de&s;troyed, and we found by digging in different places that no &s;weet wa|ter was to be procured; when it was di&s;covered that Providence had &s;o far interfered in our favour, as to bring down the fre&s;hes at a very early and unu&s;ual &s;ea|&s;on. From what accounts we could ha&s;tily gather, we were appehen&s;ive that the &s;tores of rice were either

However, the event has happily fal&s;ified our &s;urmi&s;es, and proved our in|formation fallacious, for rice has hitherto been plenti|ful and not dear. The generous &s;upplies that have been &s;ent us from the Pre&s;idency, will, I tru&s;t, &s;ecure us from &s;erious want. Our markets have not yet been attended by a per&s;on with an article for &s;ale; but this is not to be wondered at, as our &s;upplies were general|ly furni&s;hed by the villages at no great di&s;tance inland; and the&s;e countries have been drenched &s;ufficiently in &s;alt water to de&s;troy their produce. The fi&s;her-men, a mo&s;t u&s;eful body of people, inhabiting chiefly by the &s;ea-&s;ide, have been, almo&s;t totally extirpated; and we are thereby deprived of a very material part of our &s;ub&s;i&s;tance. Time alone can re&s;tore us to the com|forts we have lo&s;t, and we have rea&s;on to be thank|ful that things have not turned out &s;o bad as we ap|prehended. I have tired my&s;elf in attempting this nar|ration, and I fear I have almo&s;t tired you in the peru|&s;al of it.

<HEAD>SECT. LVI. OF THE CHARACTER AND MANNERS OF THE VENETIANS.</HEAD>
<P>I AM very &s;en&s;ible, that it requires a longer re&s;i|dence at Venice, and better opportunities than I have had, to enable me to give a character of the Venetians. But were I to form an idea of them from what I have &s;een, I &s;hould paint them as a lively ingenious people, extravagantly fond of public amu&s;ements, with an un|common reli&s;h for humour, and yet more attached to the real enjoyments of a life, than to tho&s;e which de|pend on o&s;tentation, and proceed from vanity.</P>
<P>The common people of Venice di&s;play &s;ome quali|ties very rarely to be found in that &s;phere of life, being remarkably &s;ober, obliging to &s;trangers, and gentle in their intercour&s;e with each other. The Venetians in general are tall and well made. Though equally ro|bu&s;t,
<PB N="26" REF="031692_0349_0FEE1C6A0B312490">
they are not &s;o corpulent as the Germans. The latter al&s;o are of fair complexions, with light grey, or blue eyes; whereas the Venetians are for the mo&s;t part of a ruddy brown colour, with dark eyes. You meet in the &s;treets of Venice many fine manly counte|nances, re&s;embling tho&s;e tran&s;mitted to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s by the pen|cils of Paul Verone&s;e and Titian. The women are of a fine &s;tile of countenance, with expre&s;&s;ive features, and a &s;kin of rich carnation. They dre&s;s their hair in a fanciful manner, which becomes them very much. They are of an ea&s;y addre&s;s, and have no aver&s;ion to cultivating an acquaintance with tho&s;e &s;trangers who are pre&s;ented to them by their relations, or have been properly recommended.</P>
<P>Strangers are under le&s;s re&s;traint here, in many par|ticulars, than the native inhabitants. I have known &s;ome, who, after having tried mo&s;t of the capitals of Europe, have prefered to live at Venice on account of the variety of amu&s;ements, the gentle manners of the inhabitants, and the perfect freedom allowed in every thing, except in blaming the mea&s;ures of government. When a &s;tranger is &s;o imprudent as to declaim again&s;t the form or the mea&s;ures of government, he will either receive a me&s;&s;age to leave the territories of the &s;tate, or one of the Sbirri will be &s;ent to accompany him to the Pope's or the Emperor's dominions.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es are thought inconvenient by many of

the Engli&s;h. They are better calculated, however, for the climate of Italy, than if they were built according to the London model, which, I &s;uppo&s;e, is the plan tho&s;e critics approve. The floors are of a red plai&s;ter, with a brilliant glo&s;&s;y &s;urface, much more beautiful than wood, and far preferable in ca&s;e of fire, who&s;e progre&s;s they are calculated to che<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">k.</P>
<P>The principal apartments are on the &s;econd floor. The Venetians &s;eldom inhabit the fir&s;t, which is often entirely filled with lumber. Perhaps they prefer the &s;econd, becau&s;e it is farthe&s;t removed from the moi&s;|ture of the lakes; or perhaps they prefer it becau&s;e it is better lighted and more cheerful: or they may have &s;ome better rea&s;on for this preference than I am ac|quainted with, or can imagine.</P>
<P>Though the inhabitants of Great Britain make u&s;e of the fir&s;t floors for their chief apartments, this does not form a complete demon&s;tration that the Venetians are in the wrong for prefering the &s;econd. When an acute &s;en&s;ible people univer&s;ally follow one cu&s;tom, in a mere matter of conveniency, however ab&s;urd that cu&s;|tom may appear in the eyes of a &s;tranger at fir&s;t &s;ight, it will generally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e found that there is &s;ome rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> advan|tage in it, which compen&s;ates all the apparent incon|veniencies. Of this, travellers who do not hurry with too much rapidity through the countries they vi&s;it, are very &s;en&s;ible: For, after having had time to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">gh ev|ery
<PB N="28" REF="031692_0351_0FEE1C6D1B05A5F8">
circum&s;tance, they often &s;ee rea&s;on to approve what they had formerly condemned. Cu&s;tom and fa&s;hion have the greate&s;t influence on our ta&s;te of beau|ty, or excellence of every kind. What from a variety of cau&s;es has become the &s;tandard in one country, is &s;ometimes ju&s;t the contrary in another. The &s;ame thing that makes a low-brimmed hat appear genteel at one time, and ridiculous at another, has made a differ|ent &s;pecies of ver&s;ification be accounted the model of perfection in old Rome and modern Italy, at Paris, or at London. In matters of ta&s;te, particularly in drama|tic poetry, the prejudices which each particular nation acquires in favour of its own, are difficult to be remov|ed. People &s;eldom obtain &s;uch a perfect knowledge of a foreign language and foreign manners, as to un|der&s;tand all the niceties of the one and the allu&s;ions to the other. In con&s;equence of this, many things are in&s;ipid to them, for which a native may have a high reli&s;h.</P>
<P>The dialogues in rhime of the French plays, appear unnatural and ab&s;urd to Engli&s;hmen, when they fir&s;t attend the French theatre; yet tho&s;e who have remain|ed long in France, and acquired a more perfect know|ledge of the language, a&s;&s;ure us, that without rhime the dignity of the tragic mu&s;e cannot be &s;upported and that, even in comedy, they produce an addition: elegance, which overbalances every objection. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="29" REF="031692_0352_0FEE1C7075D21380">
French language being more &s;tudied and better under|&s;tood by the Engli&s;h, than our languag is by the French nation, we find many of our countrymen who reli&s;h the beauties and pay the ju&s;t tribute of admiration to the genius of Corneille, while there is &s;carcely a &s;ingle Frenchman to be found, who has any idea of the merit of Shake&s;peare.</P>
<P>Without being ju&s;tly accu&s;ed of partiallity, I may a&s;&s;ert, that in this in&s;tance the Engli&s;h di&s;play a fairne&s;s and liberality of &s;entiment &s;uperior to the French. The irregularities of Shake&s;peare's drama are obvious to ev|ery eye, and would, in the pre&s;ent age, be avoided by a poet not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an hundredth part of his genius. His peculiar beauties on the other hand, are of an ex|cellence which has not, perhaps, been attained by any poet of any age or country. Yet the French critics, from Voltaire down to the poore&s;t &s;cribbler in the lit|erary journals, all &s;top at the former, declaim on the barbarous ta&s;te of the Engli&s;h nation, in&s;i&s;t on the gro|te&s;que ab&s;urdity of the poet's imagination, and illu&s;|trate both by partial extracts of the mo&s;t exceptionable &s;cenes of Shake&s;peare's plays.</P>
<P>When a whole people, with that degree of judgment which even the enemies of the Briti&s;h nation allow them to have, unite in the highe&s;t admiration of one man, and continue, for ages, to behold his pieces with unlaced delight, it might occur to tho&s;e Frenchmen,
<PB N="30" REF="031692_0353_0FEE1C77706701A8">
that there po&s;&s;ibly was &s;ome excellence in the works of this poet, though they could not &s;ee it; and a very moderate &s;hare of candour might have taught them, that it would be more becoming to &s;pare their ridicule till they acquired little more knowledge of the author again&s;t whom it is pointed.</P>
<P>An accident which occured &s;ince my arrival at Ven|ice, though founded on a prejudice much more excu&s;|able than the conduct of the critics abovementioned, has brought home to my conviction the ra&s;hne&s;s of tho&s;e who form opinions, without the knowledge re|qui&s;ite to direct their judgment.</P>
<P>I had got, I don't know how, the mo&s;t contemptu|ous opinion of the Italian drama. I had been told, there was not a tolerable actor at pre&s;ent in Italy; and I had been long taught to con&s;ider their comedy as the mo&s;t de&s;picable &s;tuff in the world, which could not a|mu&s;e, or even draw a &s;mile from any per&s;on of ta&s;te, being quite de&s;titute of true humour, full of ribaldry, and only proper for the meane&s;t of the vulgar. Impre&s;|&s;ed with the&s;e &s;entiments, I went with a party to the &s;tage-box of one of the playhou&s;es the very day of our arrival at Venice.</P>
<P>The piece was a comedy, and the mo&s;t entertaining character in it was that of a man who &s;tuttered. In this defect, and in the &s;ingular grimaces with which the actor accompanied it, con&s;i&s;ted a great part of the a|mu&s;ement.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="031692_0354_0FEE1C78F8CB8D00">
Di&s;gu&s;ted at &s;uch a pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">iful &s;ub&s;titution for wit and humour, I expre&s;&s;ed a contempt for an audience which could be entertained by &s;uch buffoonery, and who could take plea&s;ure in the exhibition of a natural in|firmity.</P>
<P>While we inwardly indulged &s;entiments of &s;elf-ap|probation, on account of the refinement and &s;uperi|ority of our own ta&s;te, and &s;upported the dignity of tho&s;e &s;entiments by a di&s;dainful gravity of countenance, the &s;tutterer was giving a piece of information to Har|lequin, which greatly intere&s;ted him, and to which he li&s;tened with every mark of eagerne&s;s. This unfortu|nate &s;peaker had ju&s;t arrived at the mo&s;t important part of his narrative, which was, to acquaint the impatient li&s;tener where his mi&s;tre&s;s was concealed, when he un|luckily &s;tumbled on a word of &s;ix or &s;even &s;yllables which completely ob&s;tructed the progre&s;s of his narra|tion. He attempted it again and again, but always without &s;ucce&s;s. Though many other words might explain the meaning equally well, it is as ea&s;y to make a &s;aint change his religion, as prevail on a &s;tutterer to accept of another word in place of that at which he has &s;tumbled. He adheres to his fir&s;t word to the la&s;t, and will &s;ooner expire with it in his throat, than give it up for any other you may offer. Harlequin, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, pre&s;ented his friend with a dozen, but he rejected them all with di&s;dain, and per&s;i&s;ted in
<PB N="32" REF="031692_0355_0FEE1C9DF21EB040">
his un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts on that which had fir&s;t come in his way. At length, making a de&s;perate effort, when all the &s;pectators were gaping in expectation of his &s;afe delivery, the cruel word came up with its broad-&s;ide foremo&s;t, and &s;tuck directly acro&s;s the unhappy man's wind-pipe. He gaped, and panted, and croaked; his face flu&s;hed, and his eyes &s;eemed ready to &s;tart from his head. Harlequin unbuttoned the Stutterer's wai&s;t|coat, and the neck of his &s;hirt; he fanned his face with his cap, and held a bottle of hart&s;horn to his no&s;e. At length, fearing his patient would expire before he could give the de&s;ired intelligence, in a fit of de&s;pair he pitched his head full in the dying man's &s;tomach, and the word bolted out of his mouth to the mo&s;t di&s;tant part of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>This was performed in a manner &s;o perfectly droll, and the humorous ab&s;urdity of the expedient came &s;o unexpectedly upon me, that I immediately bur&s;t into a mo&s;t exce&s;&s;ive fit of laughter, in which I was accompa|nied by my friends; and our laughter continued in &s;uch loud, violent, and repeated fits, that the attention of the audience being turned from the &s;tage to our box, occa&s;ioned a renewal of the mirth all over the playhou&s;e with greater vociferation than at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>When we returned to the inn, I was a&s;ked, if I were as much convinced as ever, that a man mu&s;t be per|fectly devoid of ta&s;te who could conde&s;cend to laugh at an Italian comedy?</P>

<HEAD>SECT. LVII. OF THE SITUATION OF VENICE, ITS CANALS AND BRIDGES.</HEAD>
<P>THE view of Venice, at &s;ome little di&s;tance from the town, is mentioned by many travellers in terms of the highe&s;t admiration. I had been &s;o often forewarn|ed of the amazement with which I &s;hould be &s;truct at the fir&s;t &s;ight of this city, that when I actually did &s;ee it, I felt little or no amazement at all. You will be|hold, &s;aid tho&s;e anticipators, a magnificent town; or more frequently, to make the deeper impre&s;&s;ion, they gave it in detail;&mdash;You will behold, &s;aid they, magni|ficent palaces, churches, towers and &s;teeples, all &s;tand|ing in the middle of the &s;ea. Well, this unque&s;tiona|bly is an uncommon &s;cene; and there is no manner of doubt that a town, &s;urrounded by water, is a very fine &s;ight; but all the travellers that have exi&s;ted &s;ince the days of Cain, will not convince me, that a town, &s;urrounded by land, is not a much finer. Can there be any compari&s;on, in point of beauty, between the dull monotony of a watery &s;urface and the delightful variety of gardens, meadows, hills and woods?</P>
<P>If the &s;ituation of Venice renders it le&s;s agreeable than another city, to behold at a di&s;tance, it mu&s;t ren|der it, in a much &s;tronger degree, le&s;s agreeable to in|habit.
<PB N="34" REF="031692_0357_0FEE1C84DF912958">
For you will plea&s;e to recollect, that, in&s;tead of walking or riding in the fields, and enjoying the fra|grance of herbs, and the melody of birds; when you wi&s;h to take the air here, you mu&s;t &s;ubmit to be pad|dled about from morning to night, in a narrow boat, a|long dirty canals; or, if you don't like this, you have one re&s;ource more, which is, that of walking in St. Mark's Place.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the di&s;advantages which Venice labours under, with regard to &s;ituation; but it has other pecu|liarities, which, in the opinion of many, overbalances them, and render it, on the whole, an agreeable town.</P>
<P>Venice is &s;aid to be built in the &s;ea: that is, it is built in the mid&s;t of &s;hallows which &s;tretch &s;ome miles from the &s;hore, at the bottom of the Adriatic Gulph. Though tho&s;e &s;hallows, being now all covered with wa|ter, have the appearance of one great lake, yet they are called Laguna, or lakes, becau&s;e formerly, as it is ima|gined, they were &s;everal. On &s;ailing on the Laguna, and looking to the bottom, many large hollows are to be &s;een, which, at &s;ome former period have, very po&s;|&s;ibly been di&s;tinct lakes, though now, being all covered with a common &s;urface of water, they form one large lake, of unequal depth. The intervals between tho&s;e hollows, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, were little i&s;lands, and are now &s;hallows, which, at ebb, are all within reach of a pole.</P>
<P>When you approach the city, you come along a li|quid
<PB N="35" REF="031692_0358_0FEE1C866706B130">
road, marked by rows of &s;takes on each &s;ide, which direct ve&s;&s;els, of a certain burthen, to avoid the &s;hollows, and keep in deeper water. The&s;e &s;hallows are a better defence to the city than the &s;tronge&s;t for|tifications. On the approach of an enemy's fleet, the Venetians have only to pull up their &s;takes, and the e|nemy can advance no farther. They are equally be|yond the in&s;ult of a land army, even in the mid&s;t of winter; for the flux and reflux of the &s;ea, and the mild|ne&s;s of the climate, prevent &s;uch a &s;trength of ice as could admit the approach of an army that way.</P>
<P>The lake in which Venice &s;tands, is a kind of &s;mall inner gulph, &s;eparated from the large one by &s;ome i&s;l|ands, at a few miles di&s;tance. The&s;e i&s;lands, in a great mea&s;ure, break the force of the Adriatic &s;torms, before they reach the Laguna; yet, in very high winds, the navigation of the lake is dangerous to gondolas, and &s;ometimes the gondoleers do not tru&s;t them&s;elves, even on the canals within the city. This is not &s;o great an inconveniency to the inhabitants, as you may imagine; becau&s;e mo&s;t of the hou&s;es have one door opening up|on a canal, and another communicating with the &s;treet; by means of which, and of the bridges, you can go to almo&s;t any part of the town by land, as well as by water.</P>
<P>The number of inhabitants are computed at 150,000; the &s;treets in general are narrow; &s;o are the ca|nals,
<PB N="36" REF="031692_0359_0FEE1C87F04DF398">
except the grand canal, which is very broad, and has a &s;erpentine cour&s;e through the middle of the city. They tell you, there are &s;everal hundred bridges in Venice. What pa&s;s under this name, however, are &s;in|gle arches thrown over the canals; mo&s;t of them pal|try enough.</P>
<P>The Rialto con&s;i&s;ts al&s;o of a &s;ingle arch, but a very noble one, and of marble. It is built acro&s;s the grand canal, near the middle, where it is narrowe&s;t. This celebrated arch is ninety feet wide on the level of the canal, and twenty-four feet high. Its beauty is impaired by two rows of booths, or &s;hops, which are erected up|on it, and divide its upper &s;urface into three narrow &s;treets. The view from the Rialto is equally lively and magnificent. The objects under your eye are the grand canal, covered with boats and gondolas, and flanked of each &s;ide with magnificent palaces, churches, and &s;pires; but this fine pro&s;pect is almo&s;t the only one in Venice; for except the grand canal, and the canal Regio, all the others are narrow and mean; &s;ome of them have no keys; the water literally wa&s;hes the walls of the hou&s;es. When you &s;ail along tho&s;e wretched canals, you have no one agreeable object to cheer the &s;ight; and the &s;mell is overwhelmed with the &s;tench which, at certain &s;ea&s;ons, exhales from the water.</P>

<P>ON our journey we pa&s;&s;ed through Ludlow, a fine, hand&s;ome town, which has an old ca&s;tle, now in a ne|glected and ruinous &s;tate; but which, by its remains, appears to have been once a very &s;trong fortre&s;s, and an habitation very &s;uitable to the power and dignity of the Lord Pre&s;ident of Wales, who re&s;ided there. Not far from this town is Okely park, belonging to Lord Powis, and part of that fore&s;t which Milton, in his ma&s;que, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been inhabited by Comus and his rout. The god is now vanqui&s;hed; but, at the revolution of every &s;even years, his rout does not fail to keep up orgies there, and in the neighbouring town, as Lord Powis knows to his co&s;t, for he has &s;pent twenty or thirty thou&s;and pounds in entertaining them at the&s;e &s;ea&s;ons, which is the rea&s;on that he has no hou&s;e at this place fit for him to live in.

and plea&s;ant, in many &s;pots; in which we &s;aw farms &s;o well &s;ituated, that they appeared to us more delightful &s;ituations than Clermont or Burleigh. At la&s;t we came by a gentleman's hou&s;e, on the &s;ide of a hill opening to a &s;weet valley; which &s;eemed to be built in a ta&s;te much &s;uperior to that of a mere coun|try e&s;quire.

The ma&s;ter, it &s;eems, was bred to law, quitted the profe&s;&s;ion about fifteen years ago, and retired into the country upon an e&s;tate of five hundred pounds per annum, with a wife and four children; notwith&s;tanding which incumbrances, he found means to fit up the hou&s;e in the manner we &s;aw it, with remarkable ele|gance, and to plant all the hill about him with groves and clumps of trees, that, together with an admirable pro&s;pect &s;een from it, render it a place which a mon|arch might envy. But, to let you &s;ee how vulgar minds value &s;uch improvement, I mu&s;t tell you an an|&s;wer made by our guide, who was &s;ervant to Lord Powis's &s;teward, and &s;poke, I pre&s;ume, the &s;en&s;e of his ma&s;ter, upon our expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome wonder that this gen|tleman had been able to do &s;o much with &s;o &s;mall a fortune; "I do not, &s;aid he, know how it is, but he is always doing &s;ome non&s;en&s;e or other."

Montgomery town is no better than a village; and all that remains of an old ca&s;tle there, is about a third part of a ruinous tower: but nothing can be finer than the &s;ituation of it and the pro&s;pect. It mu&s;t have been exceedingly &s;trong in ancient times, and able to re&s;i&s;t all the forces of the Wel&s;h: to bridle them it was built in the reign of William Rufus; three &s;ides of it are a precipice quit inacce&s;&s;ible, guarded with a deep and broad ditch! I was &s;orry that more of &s;o noble a ca&s;|tle did not remain, but glad to think, that, by our in|corporating union with the Wel&s;h, this and many o|thers, which have been erected to &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ure the neighbour|ing counties of England again&s;t their incur&s;ions, or to maintain our &s;overeignty over that fierce and warlike people, are now become u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>From hence we travelled with infinite plea&s;ure (through the mo&s;t charming country my eyes ever be|held, or my imagination can paint) to Powis ca&s;tle, part of which was burnt down about thirty years ago; but there are &s;till remains of a great hou&s;e, &s;ituated &s;o finely, and &s;o nobly, that, were I in the place of Lord Powis, I &s;hould for&s;ake Okely park, with all its beauties, and fix my &s;eat as near there, as the mo&s;t el|igible in every re&s;pect. About three thou&s;and pounds laid out upon it, would make it the mo&s;t augu&s;t place in the kingdom. It &s;tands upon the &s;ide of a very high hill; below lies a vale of incomparable beauty,
<PB N="40" REF="031692_0363_0FEE1C97338FCC70">
with the Severn winding thro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">gh it, and the town of Wel&s;h-Pool, terminated with high mountains. The oppo&s;ite &s;ide is beautifully cultivated half way up, and green to the top, except in one or two hills, who&s;e &s;ummits are rocky, and of grote&s;que &s;hapes, that give variety and &s;pirit to the pro&s;pect. Above the ca&s;tle is a long ridge of hills finely &s;haded, part of which is the park; and &s;till higher is a terrace, up to which you are led through very fine lawns, from whence you have a view that exceeds all de&s;cription.</P>
<P>The county of Montgomery, which lies within this view, is to my eyes the mo&s;t beautiful in South Bri|tain; and though I have not been in Scotland, I can|not believe I &s;hall find any place there &s;uperior, or e|qual, to it; becau&s;e the highlands are all uncultivated, and the lowlands want wood; whereas this country is admirably &s;haded with hedge-rows. It has a lovely mixture of corn fields and meadows, though more of the latter. The vales and bottoms are large, and the mountains, that ri&s;e like a rampart all around, add a magnificence and grandeur to the &s;cene, without giv|ing you any horror or dreadful ideas, becau&s;e at Powis ca&s;tle they appear at &s;uch a di&s;tance as not to de&s;troy the beauty and &s;oftne&s;s of the country between them. There are indeed &s;ome high hills within that inclo&s;ure, but being woody and green, they make a more plea&s;|ing variety, and take off nothing from the pro&s;pect.
<PB N="41" REF="031692_0364_0FEE1C9C69AEFD70">
The ca&s;tle has an old-fa&s;hioned garden ju&s;t under it, which a few alterations might make very pretty; for there is a command of water and wood in it, which may be &s;o managed as to produce all the beauties that art can add to what liberal nature has &s;o lavi&s;hly done for this place.</P>
<P>We went from thence to &s;ee Pe&s;till Rhaider, a fa|mous ca&s;cade; but it did not quite an&s;wer my expec|tations, for though the fall is &s;o high, the &s;tream is but narrow, and it wants the complement of wood, the water falling like a &s;pout on an even de&s;cent, down the middle of a wide naked rock, without any breaks to &s;catter the water. Upon the whole, it gave me but little plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>After having &s;een the Velino, we lay that night at the hou&s;e of a gentleman, who had the care of Lord Powis's lead mines; it &s;tands in a valley, which &s;eems the abode of quiet and &s;ecurity, &s;urrounded with very high mountains on all &s;ides; but in it&s;elf airy, &s;oft, and agreeable. If a man was di&s;po&s;ed to forget the world, and be forgotten by it, he could not find a more proper place. In &s;ome of tho&s;e mountains are veins of lead ore, which have been &s;o rich as to produce in time pa&s;t, twenty thou&s;and pounds per annum, to the old Duke of Powis, but they are not near &s;o valuable now. Perhaps you will object, that the idea of wealth dug up in this place does not con&s;i&s;t with that of retire|ment. I agree it does not; but, all the wealth being
<PB N="42" REF="031692_0365_0FEE1C9DF21EB040">
hid under ground, the eye &s;ees nothing there but peace and tranquilty.</P>
<P>The next morning we a&s;cended the mountain of Ber|win, one of the highe&s;t in Wales; and when we came to the top of it, a pro&s;pect opened to us, which &s;truck the mind with awful a&s;toni&s;hment. Nature is in all her maje&s;ty there; but it is the maje&s;ty of a tyrant, frowning over the ruins and de&s;olation of a country. The enormous mountains, or rather rocks, of Merion|eth&s;hire inclo&s;ed us all round. There is not upon the&s;e mountains a tree or &s;hrub, or a blade of gra&s;s; nor did we &s;ee any marks of habitations or culture in the whole place. Between them is a &s;olitude fit for De&s;pair to inhabit; whereas all we had &s;een before in Wales &s;eemed formed to in&s;pire the meditations of love. We were &s;ome hours in cro&s;&s;ing this de&s;art, and then had the view of a fine woody vale, but narrow and deep through which a rivulet ran as clear and rapid as the Scotch burns, winding in very agreeable forms, with a very pretty ca&s;cade. On the edge of this valley we travelled on foot, for the &s;teepne&s;s of the road would not allow us to ride without &s;ome danger; and in a|bout half an hour we came to a more open country, though &s;till inclo&s;ed with hills, in which we &s;aw the town of Bala with its beautiful lake. The town is &s;mall and ill-built; but the lake is a fine object. It is about three miles in length, and one in breadth;
<PB N="43" REF="031692_0366_0FEE1C9F7A7725D8">
the water of it is clear, and of a bright &s;ilver colour. The river Dee runs through very rich meadows; at the other end are towering high mountains; on the &s;ides are gra&s;&s;y hills, but not &s;o well wooded as I could wi&s;h them to be. There is al&s;o a bridge of &s;tone built over the river, and a gentleman's hou&s;e which embeli&s;hes the pro&s;pect. But what Bala is mo&s;t famous for is the beauty of its women; and indeed I there &s;aw &s;ome of the prettie&s;t girls I ever beheld. The lake produces ve|ry fine trout, and a fi&s;h called <HI>whiting,</HI> peculiar to it&s;elf, and of a very delicate ta&s;te.</P>
<P>After we left the banks of the lake, where we had an agreeable day, we got again into the de&s;art; but le&s;s horrid than I have already de&s;cribed, the vale being more fertile, and feeding &s;ome cattle. Nothing remark|able occurred in our ride, until we came to Fe&s;tiniog, a village in Merioneth&s;hire, the vale before which is the mo&s;t perfectly beautiful of all we had &s;een. From the heighth of this village you have a view of the &s;ea. The hills are green, and well &s;haded with wood. There is a lovely rivulet, which winds through the bottom; on each &s;ide are meadows, and above are corn fields a|long the &s;ides of the hills; at each end are high moun|tains, which &s;eemed placed there to guard this charm|ing retreat again&s;t any invaders. With the women one loves, with the friend of one's heart, and a good &s;tudy of books, one might pa&s;s an age there, and think

it a day. If one has a mind to live long and renew his youth, let him come and &s;ettle at Fe&s;tiniog. Not long ago there died in that neighbour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ood an hone&s;t Welch farmer, who was 105 years of age; by his fir&s;t wife he had 30 children, 10 by his &s;econd, and 4 by his third; his younge&s;t &s;on was 81 years younger than his elde&s;t, and 800 per&s;ons de&s;cended from his body, at|tended his funeral.</P>
<P>When we had &s;kirted this happy vale an hour or two, we came to a narrow branch of the &s;ea, which is dry at low water. As we pa&s;&s;ed over the &s;ands we were &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee that all the cattle preferred that barren place to the meadows. The guide &s;aid it was to avoid a fly, which in the heat of the day came out of the woods, and infe&s;ted them in the valleys. The view of the &s;aid &s;ands is terrible, as they are hemmed in on each &s;ide with very high hills, but broken into a thou&s;and irregular &s;hapes. At one end is the ocean, at the other the formidable mountains of Snowdon, black and naked rocks, which &s;eemed to be piled one above another. The &s;ummits of &s;ome of them are covered with clouds, and cannot be a&s;cended. They do alto|gether &s;trongly excite the idea of Burnet, of their be|ing the fragment of a demoli&s;hed world.</P>
<P>In the evening we rode along the &s;ea coa&s;t, which is here very cold. The grandeur of the ocean, corre&s;pond|ing with that of the mountains, formed a maje&s;tic and
<PB N="45" REF="031692_0368_0FEE1CA9D9DF5A20">
&s;olemn &s;cene; ideas of immen&s;ity &s;welled and exalted our minds at the &s;ight; all le&s;&s;er objects appeared mean and trifling, &s;o that we could hardly do ju&s;tice to the ruins of an old ca&s;tle, &s;ituated upon the top of a con|ical hill, the foot of which is wa&s;hed by the &s;ea, and which has every feature that can give a romantic ap|pearance.</P>
<P>Next morning being fair, we ventured to climb up to the top of the mountain, not indeed &s;o high as Snow|don, which is here called <HI>Moel Guidon,</HI> that is, the ne&s;t of the eagle; but one degree lower than that called <HI>Moel Happock,</HI> the ne&s;t of the hawk; from whence we &s;aw a Phaenomenon, new to our eyes, but common in Wales; on the one &s;ide was midnight, on the other bright day. The whole extent of the mountain of Snowdon, on our left hand, was wrapped in clouds, from top to bottom; but on the right the &s;un &s;hone mo&s;t gloriou&s;ly over the &s;ea-coa&s;t of Carnarvon. The hill we &s;tood upon was perfectly clear, and the way we came up a pretty ea&s;y a&s;cent; but before us was a precipice of many hundred yards, and below, a vale, which though not cultivated, has much &s;avage beau|ty; the &s;ides were &s;teep, and fringed with low wood.</P>
<P>There were two little lakes, or rather large pools, that &s;tood in the bottom, from which i&s;&s;ued a rivulet, that &s;erpentined in view for two or three miles, and was a plea&s;ing relief to the eyes.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. LIX. OF CARNARVON, AND THE ISLE OF ANGLESEA.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I arrived at Carnarvon, I had a very fine view of the &s;ea, and one of the fine&s;t towns I had &s;een in England or Wales; the old walls of which, with the towers and bulwarks, are almo&s;t entire; they are high and &s;trongly built. The towers are round, and rather more of the Roman than the Gothic form of architecture. At one end they join to the wall of the ca&s;tle, which is a va&s;t and noble building, of which the out&s;ide is likewi&s;e well pre&s;erved, but the in&s;ide is de|moli&s;hed. The people here &s;how the remains of a chamber, where King Edward II. was born, and re|ceived the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of all the nobility in Wales in his cradle. The ca&s;tle it&s;elf was built by his father, and is indeed a noble work.</P>
<P>As we rode from Carnarvon, the country about was
<PB N="47" REF="031692_0370_0FEE1CACE99D7528">
&s;oftened into a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ence of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing kind, and was rendered more &s;o by the contra&s;t with that from which we came. We travelled along the &s;hore of Menai, an arm of the &s;ea, as broad as the Thames, op|po&s;ite to Lord Duncannon's. Our road led us over fine &s;hady lawns, perfumed &s;o with honey &s;uckles, that they were a <HI>Paradi&s;&s;etto;</HI> and over gentle hills, from whence we had a lovely view of the Menai and the i&s;le of Angle&s;ea, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ies on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of it, and then lo&s;t them again in agreeable valleys, like tho&s;e of Reading, or the Hertford&s;hire vales. We enjoyed the&s;e &s;cenes for &s;ome miles, till we came to a ferry, by which we pa&s;&s;ed into Angle&s;ea, and landed at the &s;eat of Sir Nicholas Bayley, which is the plea&s;ante&s;t &s;pot in the i&s;land. He has Gotheri&s;ed an old hou&s;e with good judgment and ta&s;te. The view from it is charm|ing. He &s;ees the &s;weet country, through which we had travelled, from Carnarvon to Snowdon above it, which ennobles the pro&s;pect; the Menai winds in a mo&s;t beautiful manner, ju&s;t under his windows; his woods &s;hade the banks of it on each &s;ide, quite down to the water; above which, intermixed with them, are ever-green lawns, which, if helped with a very little art, would, together with his wood, make a garden or park, of the mo&s;t perfect beauty; but all is yet in a rude and neglected &s;tate. From thence we went to Baronhill, the &s;eat of Lord Bulkeley, above the town
<PB N="48" REF="031692_0371_0FEE1CB223A365D8">
of Beaumaris, in the &s;ame i&s;land, it has a view of the &s;ea, and coa&s;t of Carnarvon, which is indeed very fine, but I think inferior to that of Lord Edgecomb's, with which I have heard it compared. The hou&s;e is a bad one; the gardens are, made in a very fine ta&s;te; but upon the whole, I like it much le&s;s than Sir N. Bailey's, though the reputation of the former is greater in Wales.</P>
<P>All the re&s;t of the i&s;le of Angle&s;ea is a naked and unplea&s;ant country, without a tree or hedge to be &s;een in it, uncultivated &s;till, from the ob&s;tinacy of the peo|ple, in adhering to the ignorance of their forefathers; &s;o that I am told it does not produce the tenth part of what the land is capable if improved by the agriculture of England. From Beaumaris we rode over the lands, at low water to Penman Mawr, a high and rocky moun|tain, the pa&s;&s;age over which mu&s;t have been very fright|ful, before they built a wall along the edge of the wood, which &s;ecures you from the danger of falling down the precipice that is below it into the &s;ea; but with this guard it is very agreeable, the pro&s;pect of the &s;ea and country being very fine.</P>
<P>I never &s;aw any thing that &s;truck me more than the fir&s;t view of Conway ca&s;tle, to which we &s;oon came af|ter pa&s;&s;ing this mountain. It was built by Edward the Fir&s;t, in much the &s;ame &s;tyle with that of Carnarvon; but &s;tronger and more regular. The &s;ituation is noble, and it &s;tands upon a rock of con&s;iderable heighth; in|&s;tead
<PB N="49" REF="031692_0372_0FEE1CB758DC3E18">
of a ditch, three &s;ides of it are defended by an arm of the &s;ea, and four turrets that ri&s;e above the towers, be&s;ides two others at one end &s;tanding below the others, about the middle of the rock that over-hangs the &s;ea. The walls between are battlements, and look ve|ry &s;trong; they are, in &s;ome places, fourteen or fifteen feet thick, in none le&s;s than twelve. The whole to|gether hath the grande&s;t appearance of any building I ever beheld, e&s;pecially as the walls of the town, which are built like tho&s;e of Carnarvon, but with bolder and hand&s;omer towers, appear right in one view to the eye with the ca&s;tle, when fir&s;t you approach it. All the out&s;ide remains, except one tower, as in the time of Edward the fir&s;t; and that was not demoli&s;hed either with battering engines or with cannons, but by the peo|ple of the place taking &s;tones from the foundation, for their own u&s;e, whenever they plea&s;ed; the con&s;e|quence of which was, that the greate&s;t part of the tow|erfell into the &s;ea. But the upper part more &s;urpri&s;ingly continues &s;till firm in the form of an arch; and Lord Hertford, the pre&s;ent proprietor, hath forbid any dil|appidation for the future. We were told his grandfa|ther would have lived in this ca&s;tle, could he have per|cha&s;ed any lands in the country about; but finding none to be fold, he dropt the de&s;ign.</P>

me a great deal of plea&s;ure: But now the floors, ciel|ings, and roofs, are all taken away, &s;o that we can hardly gue&s;s at its ancient magnificence. The ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> mu&s;t have been a noble room; it is 100 feet long, thir|ty wide, and thirty high. The roof was &s;upported by very beautiful arches, which &s;till remain. There are two chimneys in it, and it was well lighted. The &s;tone|work of the windows is exceeding hand&s;ome. Had our friend Milla (the builder of Hagley hou&s;e) been with us, he would have fallen down and adored the architect. The eight towers &s;eem to have contained three very good bed-chambers each, placed one above another, be&s;ides &s;ome upper rooms. The chambers are eighteen feet diameter, except one called the king's chamber, which has a bow window, gained out of the thickne&s;s of the wall; and the room is by that means extended about thirty feet. Over the arch of that win|dow are the arms of Edward the Fir&s;t.</P>
<P>From Conway ca&s;tle, we travelled half a day's jour|ney through a very romantic country, to Rudland, or rather Land ca&s;tle, the remains of which are le&s;s per|fect than Carnarvon or Conway; nor was it ever e|qual to them, either in extent or beauty, which I am &s;orry for, as it was built by Henry the Second.</P>
<P>Not far from hence, at a place called Bodrudan, we pa&s;&s;ed a rainy day in a very comfortable manner, with an old acquaintance of mine, who is the lady of the

ca&s;tle, and hath forbid all depredations, which the peo|ple of the neighbourhood u&s;ed to make, by taking it down to build and repair their hou&s;es and pig&s;ties, which would have demoli&s;hed it like the tower of Con|way.</P>
<P>The next morning we went to the top of the hill, from whence we had a view of the whole va&s;e of Clwydd, from one end to the other, which is equalled by none in England for fertility and beauty. There is neither mountain nor rock to be &s;een in any part of it. After you turn your back upon Rudland, the hills on one &s;ide of it ri&s;e very gradually by gentle a&s;cents. Mo&s;t of them are cultivated quite to their &s;ummits, oth|ers half way up; and when the tops are not enclo&s;ed, they are a fine gra&s;&s;y down, like Clent-hill, and &s;haded and enlivened with wood, like the &s;lopes in my park. But yet I prefer the &s;cenes in Montgomery &s;hire to this lively vale. There is a great beauty in this, but there is no maje&s;ty. Whereas there, as in the mind of a cer|tain lady, with whom I have the honour to be inti|mately acquainted, the &s;oft and the agreeable is mixed with the noble, the great, and the &s;ublime.</P>
<P>About the middle of this vale, upon the brow of a hill, &s;tands Denbigh ca&s;tle, a very fine ruin; it enclo|&s;es as much ground as Conway or Carnarvon, but hath not &s;o much building. The towers of it are &s;tanding at a very con&s;iderable di&s;tance from one another, be|ing
<PB N="52" REF="031692_0375_0FEE1CBBF1F375D8">
fewer in number; but they are in the &s;ame &s;tyle of architecture, having been built in the reign of the &s;ame king, who by the&s;e &s;trong fortre&s;&s;es &s;ecured to him&s;elf and his po&s;tery the dominion of North Wales. The hall is &s;till pretty entire, and rivals that of Conway, ex|cept that the roof doth not appear to have been arched.</P>
<P>The towers are all in a ruinous &s;tate. I think it a pi|ty and &s;hame to the owner, that more care is not taken to pre&s;erve &s;uch re&s;pectable remains of antiquity. When we left the vale of Clwydd, we went into a bar|ren and mountainous country which continued from Rythin as far as Wrexham.</P>
<P>From Wrexham we went to Wyn&s;tay, the &s;eat of Sir Watkin Williams Wynn. Part of the hou&s;e is old; but he had begun building a new one before his death, in a very good ta&s;te. One wing is fini&s;hed, and that alone makes a very agreeable hou&s;e. The view from it is the mo&s;t chearful I ever beheld. It &s;tands in the middle of a very pretty park, and looks over that to a mo&s;t delightful country. But if the park was extend|ed a little farther, it would take in a hill, with the view of a valley, mo&s;t beautifully wooded; and the river Dee winding in &s;o romantic and charming a manner, that I think it exceeds that of Fe&s;tiniog, or any confined pro&s;|pect I ever beheld.</P>

<P>Leaving Machynlleth we &s;oon found our&s;elves in a truly Alpine valley; the rapid torrent roaring over a bed of broken rocks, and now and then interrupted by immen&s;e fragments, from which it fell in con&s;iderable cataracts; the woody and exalted precipices on each &s;ide of the river, and the mountain brooks continual|ly rattling about us formed a romantic picture of the romantic road between Aigues Belles and mount Ce|nis. Towards the extremity of this beautiful &s;cene, the huge mountain of Cader Idris pre&s;ented its naked, craggy, and prominent cliff, full to our front. I never &s;aw an object more awfully &s;ublime; it extends more than half a mile in length, and is at lea&s;t a thou&s;and feet high.</P>
<P>The road pa&s;&s;es under part of this gloomy and tre|mendrous precipice, on the right hand, within &s;ight of
<PB N="55" REF="031692_0378_0FEE1CC7E21BD790">
a large lake on the left, and clo&s;e to the brink of a &s;maller. It then cro&s;&s;es an arm of Cader Idris, and with a quick de&s;cent of two rocky miles, ends at Dolgelley. Part of this latter path leads through a thin oak wood, which hangs over an impetuous torrent, foaming down a rug|ged declivity, as &s;teep as the road.</P>
<P>The wretched town of Dolgelley is finely &s;ituated upon the Avon's bank. The vallies around are rich|ly inter&s;per&s;ed with woods and decent hou&s;es, while the mountains bound every pro&s;pect from the town at ir|regular di&s;tances.</P>
<P>Cader Idris, from the quickne&s;s of its a&s;cent, and the nearne&s;s of its &s;ummit, appears much higher than it re|ally is; many people, on this account, have con&s;idered it as the highe&s;t mountain in Wales, but Snowdon is indi&s;putably higher.</P>
<P>I could learn no intelligence of its real perpendicular elevation; but I &s;hould think it mu&s;t be more than half a mile above the level of the river at Dolgelley, which receives the tide at a &s;mall di&s;tance below the town.</P>
<P>There appears &s;ome &s;pirit in the flannel trade in this neighbourhood, which extends its bu&s;y influence for many miles round the country.</P>
<P>About five miles from Dolgelly, (a few large Scotch firs on each &s;ide of the rode marking the &s;pot) we turn|ed upwards on our left, to &s;ee a water-fall behind a
<PB N="56" REF="031692_0379_0FEE1CCD15B61EE8">
&s;mall hou&s;&egrave; of a widow Vaugham. This cataract is bro|ken into two broad parts; the upper de&s;cends about thir|ty-five feet, upon a &s;mall craggy ridge, and the lower about twenty feet, into a romantic bafon, encircled with perpendicular or impending rocks. A fine wood &s;ur|rounds it, and &s;ome of the large&s;t trees project their &s;hady branches over the precipices of the ca&s;cade.</P>
<P>Returning to the high road, we &s;oon cro&s;&s;ed a bridge, under which the torrent rattled from the above ca&s;|cade, down a &s;teep declivity, and through large di&s;|jointed fragments towards the river.</P>
<P>We quitted the valley two miles farther, and a&s;cend|ed a barren and di&s;mal mountain. The road continu|ed lone&s;ome and melancholy for &s;everal miles, but at length conducted us to a comfortable little inn.</P>
<P>My companion's curio&s;ity led him to turn to the right hand from nearly the &s;ummit of the mountain, which is called Pen-maen, towards the falls of the riv|ers Mothvaye and Cayne. He found the road exceed|ingly bad, but his trouble&s;ome ride was amply repaid by the object in pur&s;uit. The cataracts were very deep, and fell in broad &s;heets of water, through a vari|ed &s;cenery of woods and rocks.</P>
<P>The&s;e remarkable cataracts are each of them the fall of a whole river, and &s;ituated within a quarter of a mile of one another. That of the Mothvaye forms two very broad &s;heets of water, divided about half way
<PB N="57" REF="031692_0380_0FEE1CD072F75D00">
down by a ridge in the rock, each part being al&s;o beau|tifully broken by frequent crags projecting through it. This whole fall may be about &s;eventy or eighty feet in depth.</P>
<P>That of the Cayne is a continued &s;teep fall from rock to rock, not near &s;o wide as the former but much higher. I &s;hould imagine it mu&s;t be from an hundred and fifty or two hundred feet high, but the bottom is of very difficult acce&s;s. The &s;cenery, which imme|diately &s;urrounds them both, is noble beyond de&s;crip|tion, producing a fine contra&s;t to the naked hills in their neighbourhood.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. LXI. OF DUBLIN, AND THE HOSPITALITY OF THE IRISH. A. D. 1774.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING cro&s;&s;ed St. George's Channel from Liv|erpool, the mo&s;t pro&s;perous &s;ea-port town on the we&s;t|ern coa&s;t of England, the fir&s;t land we made was Houth Heath, a point of land about eight miles ea&s;t of Dub|lin, forming the north point of its bay, which is about three or four miles wide, and &s;ix or &s;even deep. The bar of this harbour, is very incommodious; but the
<PB N="58" REF="031692_0381_0FEE1CD3D2187240">
entrance into the harbour, being at lea&s;t eight miles from Dublin city, is extremely beautiful and pictur|e&s;que, diver&s;ified with hills and promontories on either hand, exhibiting a very &s;pacious amphitheatre, bound|ed by a high &s;hore, and &s;aid to be exceeded in grandeur by none, except the bay of Naples, to who&s;e &s;uperior|ity of view, Mount Ve&s;uvius does not a little contri|bute. The country all round is &s;prinkled with white villas. From the entrance, the light-hou&s;e on the &s;outh &s;ide of the harbour appears to great advantage. At a little di&s;tance from it is Iri&s;h town (two miles di&s;|tant from Dublin) to which place the dyke from that city reaches; and which, when carried on to the extent propo&s;ed, will con&s;iderably increa&s;e the quantity of mar&s;h ground already retrieved from the bay, at the bottom of which the river Liffy di&s;charges it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The city of Dublin is not &s;een to advantage from the water; yet the land&s;cape upon the whole is highly rich and beautiful, being horizoned in &s;ome places by mountains, exactly conical, called the Sugar-loaf hills. I am per&s;uaded there are many who would not regret a journey thither for this &s;ingle pro&s;pect, to render which complete, a number of circum&s;tances are nece&s;&s;ary, but which can &s;eldom concur, &s;uch as the &s;ea&s;on of the year, the time of the day, and the clearne&s;s of the atmo&s;phere when you enter the bay.</P>
<P>The magnitude of the city of Dublin is much great|er
<PB N="59" REF="031692_0382_0FEE1CD901B3A758">
than in general imagined, being nearer a fourth than a fifth of that of London. If you view it from any of the towers, it &s;eems more; but from walking the &s;treets, you would &s;uppo&s;e it to be le&s;s. In 1754, there were 12,857 hou&s;es in this city; but in 1766, they were en|crea&s;ed to 13,194; and are now further augmented to 13,500, which indeed is far &s;hort of one fourth of the number of hou&s;es in London; yet there is not &s;o great a di&s;proportion in the number of inhabitants who are &s;uppo&s;ed, at a moderate computation, to amount to 160,000. It is nearly circular, about eight miles in cir|cumference. We &s;ee it to great advantage from any of its &s;teeples, the blue &s;late having a very good effect.</P>
<P>The be&s;t view is from the Phoenix Park, (the Hyde Park of Dublin) but much more exten&s;ive than ours, and would be exqui&s;itely beautiful i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> dre&s;&s;ed and plant|ed; but except &s;ome thorns and the clumps of elms planted by the late lord Che&s;terfield when he was lord Lieutenant, there are very few trees upon it. In one part of this park his Lord&s;hip rai&s;ed a hand&s;ome col|umn of free-&s;tone, fluted, with a phoenix on the top, i&s;&s;uing out of a flame; it has an in&s;cription on the ba&s;e, importing that he embelli&s;hed the park at his own expence, for the recreation of the citizens of Dublin; and his name is &s;till held in veneration among them. In this park there is a fort.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of Dublin is very indifferent, but
<PB N="60" REF="031692_0383_0FEE1CDA89C78658">
the new &s;treets are as elegant as the modern &s;treets of We&s;tmin&s;ter. Lately has been added to it an elegant &s;quare, called Merryon's &s;quare, built in a &s;uperb &s;tile. Near that is the &s;quare called St. Stephen's Green, each &s;ide being near a quarter of a mile, probably the large&s;t in Europe, round which is a gravel-walk of near a mile, where genteel company walk in the evenings, and on Sunday's after two o'clock. This &s;quare has &s;ome grand hou&s;es, and is in general well built; and although there is a great inequality in the hou&s;es, yet this in &s;ome re&s;pect adds to its beauty. In the mid&s;t of it is an eque&s;trian &s;tatue of George II. in bra&s;s, e|rected in 1758. The &s;ituation is chearful, and the buildings around it multiply very fa&s;t. A new &s;quare has lately been begun, called Palatine &s;quare, near the barracks, a regular fine range of buildings, which when completed, will con&s;iderably add to the growing im|provements of this city.</P>
<P>The quays of Dublin are its principal beauty. They lie on each &s;ide the river Liffy, which is banked and walled in the whole length of the city; and at the breadth of a wide &s;treet from the river on each &s;ide, the hou&s;es are built fronting each other, which has a good effect. This embarkment, when paved, will be &s;upe|rior to any part of London.</P>
<P>The Liffy runs for about two miles almo&s;t in a &s;traight line through the city. It has five bridges over
<PB N="61" REF="031692_0384_0FEE1CDC1213A3C8">
it; of which E&s;&s;ex bridge is the mo&s;t worthy of notice. It con&s;i&s;ts of five arches of &s;tone. The chord of the middle one is forty-eight feet. It was begun in 1753, fini&s;hed in about a year and a half, and co&s;t 20,000 gui|neas. It has rai&s;ed foot-paths, alcoves, and ballu&s;trades like We&s;tmin&s;ter-bridge, of a white &s;tone, coar&s;e but hard. It fronts Chapel-&s;treet to the north, and Parlia|ment-&s;treet to the &s;outh. The length is two hundred and fifty feet, and the breadth much the &s;ame as that of We&s;tmin&s;ter. Queen's bridge was rebuilt in 1764, is exceedingly neat, and con&s;i&s;ts of three elegant arches. The other bridges are not worth mentioning, as they are merely conveniences to &s;ave the trouble of ferrying acro&s;s the river, and defy every order of architecture.</P>
<P>At the end of E&s;&s;ex-bridge is the elegant new build|ing of the Exchange, which does honour to the mer|chants who conducted it, the expence being mo&s;tly de|frayed by lotteries. The whole is of white &s;tone, richly embelli&s;hed with &s;emi-columns of the Corinthian order, a cupola, and other ornaments, with a &s;tatue of his pre&s;|ent Maje&s;ty George III: erected in 1779.</P>
<P>Near this, on a little eminence, is &s;ituated the ca&s;tle, the re&s;idence of the Lord Lieutenant, which con&s;i&s;ts of two large courts, called the upper and lower ca&s;tle-yard; in the latter of which are the Trea&s;ury, and &s;ome other public offices. Though there is little grandeur in the outward appearance of either, yet, up|on
<PB N="62" REF="031692_0385_0FEE1CE3188D1860">
on the whole, this ca&s;tle is far &s;uperior to the palace of St. James's, as well in the exterior, as the &s;ize and the elegance of the apartments within.</P>
<P>Here are two cathedrals, eighteen pari&s;h churches, be&s;ides &s;everal chapels and meeting hou&s;es. Neither of the cathedrals are remarkable for their architecture; and as to the pari&s;h-churches, except on the front of 3 or 4 of their &s;teeples, external embelli&s;hments have been lit|tle &s;tudied, all that &s;eems to have been attended to was neatne&s;s and convenience within; but they are gene|rally de&s;titute of every monumental decoration. In the cathedrals only, can be &s;een whatever of the monu|mental kind is worthy of ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>From the general badne&s;s of the &s;treets of Dublin, hackney coaches are more frequent in proportion than in London, and &s;edan chairs are every where as com|mon as about St. James's.</P>
<P>In the year 1749, it was computed, that in the city and liberties there were two thou&s;and ale-hou&s;es, three hundred taverns, and twelve thou&s;and brandy-&s;hops. At pre&s;ent, in this exten&s;ive place, there are but 7 or 8 coffee hou&s;es, and they are re&s;orted to for tea and cof|fee only, not like tho&s;e in London, where dinners and &s;uppers make a very convenient addition; nor are there above half a dozen chop-hou&s;es; &s;uch accom|modations, being novel in Dublin.</P>
<P>It is very extraordinary, that in this large and popu|lous
<PB N="63" REF="031692_0386_0FEE1CE4A241DDF0">
city, there &s;hould be &s;uch an almo&s;t total want of &s;trangers and travellers. This defect obliges every bo|dy, who is acquainted with the place, to get into pri|vate lodgings as &s;oon as he arrives, or to u&s;e the hotels lately &s;et up; &s;ome of which are elegant.</P>
<P>During my &s;tay here, I was frequently pre&s;ented with the picture of a late Touri&s;t, at the bottom of the chamber-ve&s;&s;els, with his mouth and eyes open, ready to receive the libation; and on enquiry found, that even the uten&s;il now is more frequently called by the name of a Twi&s;s than any other, in contempt of the illiberal reflections of that gentleman, who was &s;o ho&s;|pitably received here; Indeed, ho&s;pitality holds its re|&s;idence here; for it is cu&s;tomary for almo&s;t every gen|tleman, who dines with your friend, to a&s;k you for a day; nay, they will &s;ometimes invite the whole com|pany to be of your party. This &s;ocial cu&s;tom is &s;till very prevalent, though not &s;o much, I am told, as it has been.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to drinking, I have been happily di&s;|appointed. The bottle is circulated freely but not to the exce&s;s we have heard it was, and I of cour&s;e dread|ed to find. Common &s;en&s;e is re&s;uming her empire. The practice of cramming gue&s;ts is already exploded, and that of gorging them is daily lo&s;ing ground. Wherever I have yet been, I was always de&s;ired to do ju&s;t as I would chu&s;e; nay, I have been at &s;ome tables
<PB N="64" REF="031692_0387_0FEE1CE631B66CD8">
where the practice of drinking healths at dinner was entirely laid a&s;ide. Let the cu&s;tom originate whence it may, it is now unnece&s;&s;ary; in many ca&s;es it is un|&s;ea&s;onable, and in all &s;uperfluous.</P>
<P>The tables of the fir&s;t fa&s;hion are covered ju&s;t as in London; I can &s;carcely &s;ee any difference, unle&s;s it be that there is more variety here. Well bred people of different countries approach much nearer to each other in their manners, than tho&s;e who have not &s;een the world. This is vi&s;ible in the living of the merchants of London and Dublin. With the&s;e you never &s;ee a &s;tinted dinner at two o'clock, with a gla&s;s of port af|ter it; but you find a table, not only plentifully, but luxuriou&s;ly &s;pread, with choice wines, both at dinner and after it; and, which gives the highe&s;t ze&s;t to the entertainment, your ho&s;t receives you with &s;uch an appearance of liberality and indeed urbanity, as is very plea&s;ing. Here they betray no attention to the counter, di&s;cover no &s;ombrous gloom of computation, but di&s;|play an open frankne&s;s and &s;ocial vivacity of &s;pirit.</P>
<P>If you prefer the men of this country for their ho&s;|pitality, and the women for their beauty, you are like|ly to live well with them.</P>
<P>In general, the out&s;kirts of Dublin con&s;i&s;t chiefly of huts, or cabins, con&s;tructed of mud dried, and mo&s;tly without either chimney or window; and in the&s;e mi&s;|erable kind of dwellings, far the greater part of the in|habitants
<PB N="65" REF="031692_0388_0FEE1CE98F9303C8">
of Ireland linger out a wretched exi&s;tence. A &s;mall piece of ground is generally annexed to each, who&s;e chief produce is potatoes; and on the&s;e roots and milk the common Iri&s;h &s;ub&s;i&s;t all the year round, without ta&s;ting either bread or meat, except perhaps at Chri&s;tmas once or twice. What little the men can earn by their labour, or the women by their &s;pinning, is generally con&s;umed in whi&s;ky, a &s;pirituous liquor re&s;embling Geneva. Shoes and &s;tockings are &s;eldom worn by the&s;e beings, who &s;eem to form a different race from the re&s;t of mankind. Their poverty is far greater than that of the Spani&s;h Portuge&s;e, or even the Scotch Pea&s;ants, notwith&s;tanding which, they wear the appear|ance of content.</P>
<P>The indigence of the middling cla&s;s of people is vi|&s;ible even in Dublin; yet from the mo&s;t attentive and minute enquries, I am confident that the produce of this kingdom, either of corn or cattle is not above two thirds, at mo&s;t, of what by good cultivation it might yield; notwith&s;tanding which, the landed gentlemen, I believe, make as much, or more of their e&s;tates, than any in the three kingdoms, while the lands, for equal goodne&s;t produce the lea&s;t. The con&s;equences of this, with re&s;pect to the different cla&s;&s;es are obvious;&mdash;the landlords fir&s;t get all that is made of the land, and the tenants, for their labour, get poverty and potatoes.</P>
<P>The roads i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Ireland are generally good enough for
<PB N="66" REF="031692_0389_0FEE1CF08A2FA2B0">
riding, but by no means equal to the Engli&s;h roads for a carriage; and though the inns are very far from mak|ing the appearance of tho&s;e in England, yet the Engli&s;h traveller will univer&s;ally, almo&s;t, meet with civil u&s;|age, good provi&s;ions, and, for him&s;elf, clean decent lodging; but an Engli&s;h hor&s;e, could he &s;peak as well as Balaam's vehicle, would cur&s;e the country, who&s;e hay and litter are wor&s;e than can be conceived. In|deed, their oats for the mo&s;t part are tolerably good, ex|cepting two or three countries in the Ea&s;t of Lein&s;ter, and one or two in Ul&s;ter. Almo&s;t all the &s;traw pro|duced in the country is put upon their hou&s;es and cab|ins. The furniture of the &s;addle-hor&s;es al&s;o, &s;uch as &s;addle, bridle, &s;tirrups, and crupper, are frequently made all of &s;traw. Sometimes the bridle and &s;tirrups are of cord.</P>
<P>The high roads throughout the &s;outhern and we&s;tern parts are lined with beggars, who live in huts or cab|ins, of &s;uch &s;hocking materials and con&s;truction, that in hundreds of them you may &s;ee the &s;moak a&s;cend|ing through almo&s;t every inch of their defencele&s;s cov|ering, for &s;carce one in twenty of them has any win|dow or chimney; and through tho&s;e cha&s;ms, of cour&s;e, the rain mu&s;t make its way to drip upon the half-na|ked, &s;hivering, and almo&s;t half-&s;tarved inhabitants within. Notwith&s;tanding their ill appearance, a travel|ler is frequently pre&s;ented with boards at the &s;ide of the

cabin door, with "dry lodgings and tobacco;" &s;ome|times only "good dry lodgings," or "lodgings and &s;nuff." As a &s;ymbol where milk is &s;old, they hang out a white rag on a &s;tick. Indeed the&s;e huts &s;poil the figure and appearance of the much greater number of even their large&s;t towns in the whole kingdom, who&s;e entrances are generally dirty, with long &s;trings of the&s;e de&s;picable hovels, with which mo&s;t of them are prefa|ced. Into the inland towns e&s;pecially, you are gene|rally introduced through a line of fifty or an hundred of the&s;e habitations of poverty and oppre&s;&s;ion on either hand. Even the metropolis it&s;elf is not without this di&s;graceful deformity, which exhibits the penury and wretchedne&s;s of the tenants, and the mean &s;piritedne&s;s of the landlords, who, too generally for their own, or the reputation of their country, impo&s;e the building hou&s;es on their lands, upon a &s;et of people, who&s;e abi|lities will not enable them to build with materials &s;o good as tho&s;e of a &s;wallow's ne&s;t; and to the infamy of the proprietors may it be &s;aid, that mo&s;t of the farm|hou&s;es in Ireland are con&s;tructed in this mi&s;erable man|ner.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. LXII. OF THE COMPARATIVE MERIT OF THE FRENCH AND ENGLISH.</HEAD>
<P>"A FRENCHMAN," &s;ays the Earl of Che&s;terfield, "who, with a fund of learning, virtue, and good &s;en&s;e, has the manners and good-breeding of his country, is the perfection of human nature." I am not an enemy to the French; but I do not think this a&s;&s;ertion true. In my opinion, the following would have been ju&s;ter: "An Engli&s;hman, who joins manners and good-breed|ing to the &s;olidity, energy, and greatne&s;s of mind which characteri&s;e his country, is the perfection of human na|ture." I do not mean to compliment. But &s;entiments and actions are upon a more elevated &s;cale here than they can be found in any other nation in the world. There are no effects without cau&s;es; and the cau&s;es of this are very obvious. We pa&s;s our youth with the Greeks and Romans. Their great examples expand our &s;ouls; the brightne&s;s of their actions, and the &s;plen|dour of their principles, kindle the mo&s;t noble pa&s;&s;ions in our minds; and, when we come to be men, the na|ture of our government feeds this flame, and we glow with a certain internal ardour, which occa&s;ionally breaks out into action, and which is neither known nor com|prehended but in the dominions of Britain.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="031692_0392_0FEE1CF6F241D458">
I do ju&s;tice here to my country; and my &s;oul feels happy, that I am able to give her, with truth, a &s;uperi|ority over the univer&s;e in genius and magnanimity. But if from this I &s;hall be under&s;tood to think meanly of the French, becau&s;e they are the rivals and enemies of this nation, it would indeed be to mi&s;interpret me much. Though I do not think that people <HI>equal</HI> to this in <HI>greatne&s;s,</HI> I think them a very great people.

<P>In England the French have few friends. But they have one; and that one am I They could not, I acknowledge, have a feebler advocate; but while I have a tongue to &s;peak, or a pen to write, wherever I go I'll do them ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Let every man who knows that nation &s;peak of it as he found it. If he lived in their intimacy for years (as I did,) and if he found them ill-natured, ill-mannered, treacherous, and cowardly, let him &s;peak his mind. I quarrel with no man who judges for him&s;elf, and who &s;peaks the truth. But let the indulgence I grant be granted to me again; and let me be permitted to tell the world, that however other men may have found them, I found them good-humoured, good-natured, brave, poli&s;hed, frank, and friendly.</P>

<P>I could be lavi&s;h in prai&s;e of this nation; but I am &s;orry to &s;ay, that too many people here have prejudices again&s;t them, as ridiculous as they are ill-founded. They de&s;pi&s;e the French as if they were beings with|out either &s;en&s;e or &s;entiment; though their writings and actions &s;how they are full of both. Becau&s;e two &s;tates have different intere&s;ts, is that a rea&s;on that every individual belonging to tho&s;e &s;tates &s;hould promote, to the utmo&s;t of his abilities, the intere&s;t and glory of the country to which he belongs? It certainly is. And therefore, every Frenchman has the &s;ame merit in la|bouring with all his might for the de&s;truction of the Briti&s;h fleet, that every Engli&s;hman has in exerting all
<PB N="71" REF="031692_0394_0FEE1CFF801BA620">
his powers to annihilate the navy of France. If a bla&s;t of my breath could &s;end all the &s;hips &s;he has to the bot|tom of the &s;ea&mdash;puff&mdash;they were &s;unk before you could fini&s;h this period. But is it a rea&s;on I &s;hould hate or de&s;pi&s;e the French, becau&s;e I am naturally and nece&s;|&s;arily the enemy of France?</P>
<P>The be&s;t way I think to judge this matter is, to take two other rival nations; Au&s;tria and Pru&s;&s;ia; Athens and Sparta. Here you are di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate; your judg|ment will be ju&s;t. Do you think it the duty of a liber|al-minded Pru&s;&s;ian to de&s;pi&s;e an Au&s;trian? Or, &s;hould a well-born Athenian dete&s;t a Laced aemonian, becau&s;e he is equally animated by the &s;ame noble flame that warms him&s;elf&mdash;the love of his country? The nation which is able to rival another, proves her&s;elf worthy the admiration of that nation, even by her rivalry; and had I no other rea&s;on to con&s;ider the French as a great people, be&s;ide their being able to contend with England, that proof for me would be &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>But the French are perfidious <HI>in politics.</HI> I deny that they <HI>can</HI> be perfidious with the Engli&s;h. They may be treacherous, for aught I know, with the Au&s;|trians and the Spaniards. There they profe&s;s friend|&s;hip. They are of the &s;ame religion, frequently inter|marry, and have frequent alliances. With England France has no connection. She may over reach her in politics, but &s;he never can deceive her by perfidy;
<PB N="72" REF="031692_0395_0FEE1D0108ADB9B8">
becau&s;e &s;he is her uniform enemy. There is not an infant that does not know, that France ever was, and ever will be, the enemy of England. The making a peace is not making a friend&s;hip; and the French will not be more the friends of England when this peace is made, than they were five years before the war began, or than they are now. The rivalry between the two nations will la&s;t while the nations la&s;t. They are <HI>lit|tora littoribus contraria,</HI> oppo&s;ite in every thing. It is the duty of France to depre&s;s England as much as &s;he can. It is the duty of England to keep down France as much as is in her power. It is the duty of both to do ju&s;tice to the other. This ju&s;tice the French <HI>do</HI> render the Engli&s;h. I am &s;orry I cannot &s;ay the Engli&s;h do the &s;ame by them. Every cla&s;s of men in France prai&s;e the people of this country: &s;ome the &s;olidity of their under&s;tanding, and the extent of their genius; others the energy and vigour of their charac|ter; many their magnanimity and benevolence; and all, their courage and good faith. While here&mdash;but I blu&s;h for numbers, and am a&s;hamed to fini&s;h my period.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. LXIII. CHARACTER OF THE FRENCH LADIES, COM|PARED WITH THAT OF THE ENGLISH.</HEAD>
<P>WOMEN are a &s;ubject upon which &s;o much has been &s;aid and written by &s;o many men of abilities, that it is not ea&s;y to imagine a new light, in which they have not been already placed. But, talking of a nation, if one did not &s;ay &s;omething about &s;o con&s;iderable a part of it, the &s;ubject mu&s;t appear mutilated and imperfect.</P>
<P><HI>As brevity is the &s;oul of wit, I &s;hall be brief;</HI> and I &s;hall only touch on the principal points in which the women of France differ from tho&s;e of other countries.</P>
<P>When a French lady comes into a room, the fir&s;t thing that &s;trikes you is, that &s;he walks better, holds her&s;elf better, has her head and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eet better dre&s;&s;ed, her cloth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> better fancied, and better put on, than any woman you have ever &s;een.</P>
<P>When &s;he talks, &s;he is the part of plea&s;ing per&s;onifi|ed. Her eyes, her lips, her words, her ge&s;tures, are all prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing. Her language is the language of amia|blene&s;s; her accents are the accents of grace. She embelli&s;hes a trifle; &s;he intere&s;ts upon a nothing; &s;he &s;oftens a contradiction; &s;he takes off the in&s;ipidne&s;s of a compliment, by turning it elegantly; and when &s;he has a mind, &s;he &s;harpens and poli&s;hes the point of an epigram better than all the women in the world.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="031692_0397_0FEE1D0B6D3AE738">
Her eyes &s;parkle with &s;pirit; the mo&s;t delightful &s;al|lies fla&s;h from her fancy; in telling a &s;tory, &s;he is inim|itable; the motions of her body, and the accents of her tongue, are equally genteel and ea&s;y; an equal flow of &s;oftened &s;prightline&s;s keeps her con&s;tantly good-hu|moured and cheerful; and the only objects of her life are to plea&s;e, and to be plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Her vivacity may <HI>&s;ometimes</HI> approach to folly; but perhaps it is not in her moments of folly &s;he is lea&s;t in|tere&s;ting and agreeable. Engli&s;h women have many points of &s;uperiority over the French; the French are &s;uperior to them in many others. I have mentioned &s;ome of tho&s;e points in other places. Here I &s;hall on|ly &s;ay, there is a particular idea in which no woman in the world can compare with a French woman; it is in the power of <HI>intellectual irritation.</HI> She will draw wit out of a fool. She &s;trikes with addre&s;s the cords of &s;elf-love, that &s;he gives unexpected vigour and agility to fancy; and electrifies a body that appeared non-electric.</P>
<P>I have mentioned here the women of England; and I have done wrong. I did not intend it when I began the letter. They came into my mind as the only wo|men in the wolrd worthy of being compared with tho&s;e of France. To &s;ettle the re&s;pective claims of the fair &s;ex in the&s;e two countries, requires an abler pen than mine. I &s;hall not dare to examine it even in a &s;ingle point; nor pre&s;ume to determine whether, in the important ar|ticle
<PB N="75" REF="031692_0398_0FEE1D0CF541F110">
of beauty, form and colour are to be preferred to expre&s;&s;ion and grace; or whether grace and expre&s;&s;ion are to be con&s;idered as preferable to complexion and &s;hape. I &s;hall not examine whether the <HI>piquant</HI> of France is though to be &s;uperior to the <HI>touchant</HI> of Eng|land; or whether deep &s;en&s;ibility de&s;erves to be pre|ferred to animation and wit. So important a &s;ubject requires a volume. I &s;hall only venture to give a trait. If a godde&s;s could be &s;uppo&s;ed to be formed, com|pounded of Juno and Minerva, that godde&s;s would be the emblem of this country. Venus, as &s;he is, with all her amiablene&s;&s;es and imperfections, may &s;tand, ju&s;t|ly enough, for an emblem of French women. I have decided the que&s;tion without intending it; for I have given the preference to the women of England.</P>
<P>One point I had forgotten; and it is a material one. It is not to be di&s;puted on; for what I am going to write is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he opinion and &s;entiment of the univer&s;e. The Engli&s;h women are the be&s;t wives under heaven&mdash;and &s;hame be on the men who make them bad hu&s;bands.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. LXIV. OF MONTPELIER IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE. A. D. 1775.</HEAD>
<P>MONTPELIER is a delightful place of re&s;idence. I &s;taid there four days, and left it with exce&s;&s;ive regret. The town it&s;elf is by no means beautiful, the &s;treets being almo&s;t all narrow, winding, and badly laid out; but nature &s;eems to have cho&s;en the hills on which it &s;tands, to enrich with her choice&s;t favours. The a&s;|cent is ea&s;y and gradual on every &s;ide; and the &s;tates of Languedoc have ornamented the &s;ummit of it at a va&s;t expence, in a manner where ta&s;te and magnifi|cence are equally blended.</P>
<P>The pro&s;pect from this happy &s;pot I cannot de&s;cribe, though I &s;tudied it every day with an enthu&s;ia&s;tic plea|&s;ure. Raphael's pencil, or that of Lorraine, might paint it, but not even Shake&s;pear's powers of de&s;cription could do ju&s;tice to its beauties. The vales of Lan|guedoc, covered with olives or laid out in vineyards, are finely contra&s;ted with rude rocks to the north, and melt away into the &s;ea of the &s;outh. Though winter has almo&s;t &s;tripped the trees of their verdure, there is nothing melancholy or de&s;art which pre&s;ents it&s;elf to the eye. A &s;ky &s;erene and unclouded, an invigorating &s;un, a keen and whole&s;ome air &s;pread a gaiety over
<PB N="77" REF="031692_0400_0FEE1D10087E1E38">
November it&s;elf, which here is neither accompanied with fogs or rain. Montpelier has, notwith&s;tanding, lo&s;t, within the&s;e la&s;t thirty years, that reputation for &s;alubrity which conduces more to the &s;upport of a place, than any real advantages it may po&s;&s;e&s;s; and the num|ber of &s;trangers who vi&s;it it from motives of health di|mini&s;hes annually. Some trade is &s;till carried on from thence by a &s;mall river called the Les, which emp|ties it&s;elf into the &s;ea at the di&s;tance of a league; but the Mediterranean has been retiring the&s;e three centu|ries from the whole coa&s;t of Languedoc and Provence. Frejus, which is &s;ituated between Toulon and Antibes, where the Emperor Augu&s;tus laid up his gallies after the battle of Actium, is now become an inland city.</P>
<P>The country from Montpelier to Ni&s;mes, is a gar|den, level, and every where cultivated. The pea&s;ants are ju&s;t beginning to gather olives, which are very numerous, and the trees are planted with the &s;ame re|gularity as our orchards in England. I cannot but envy the inhabitants this genial climate and the&s;e fer|tile plains, and am ready to accu&s;e Nature of partiali|ty in the infinite difference which &s;he has placed be|tween the pea&s;ants of Languedoc and of Sweden. In vain will you tell me that the <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">r Patrioe,</HI> the attach|ment we naturally bear to that country where we were born, renders them equally happy, and extingui&s;hes all other di&s;tinctions. I know the force of this princi|ple;
<PB N="78" REF="031692_0401_0FEE1D18EE91F770">
I feel and cultivate it with the greate&s;t ardour&mdash;but it cannot blind me to the infinite &s;uperiority with which certain countries of the earth are endowed; a|bove other le&s;s favoured latitudes and regions.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed three days at Ni&s;mes in the &s;urvey of tho&s;e magnificent and beautiful remains of Roman great|ne&s;s which yet &s;ub&s;i&s;t there. They have been de&s;crib|ed a thou&s;and times, and it is not my intention to fa|tigue you with a repetition of them. The Amphithea|tre, and the "mai&s;on quarr&eacute;e," are known throughout every kingdom of Europe. The fir&s;t of the&s;e impre&s;|&s;es the beholder with the deepe&s;t veneration; the lat|ter excites the mo&s;t elegant and refined delight. In|dignation again&s;t the barbarians who could violate and deface the&s;e glorious monuments of antiquity, will mix with the &s;en&s;ations of every &s;pectator.</P>
<P>One can &s;carce believe that Charles Martel, from hatred to the Roman name, had the &s;avage fury to fill the corridores of the amphitheatre with wood, to which he &s;et fire with an intent to injure, though it &s;urpa&s;&s;ed his power to demoli&s;h &s;o va&s;t an edifice. Yet notwith&s;tanding the&s;e attempts of the barbarous nations, notwith&s;tanding the lap&s;e of &s;o many ages, and the effects of time, its appearance at pre&s;ent is the mo&s;t augu&s;t and maje&s;tic which can be pre&s;ented to the mind, or to the &s;en&s;es. The prodigious circumfer|ance of the amphitheatre, the &s;olidity and &s;trength of
<PB N="79" REF="031692_0402_0FEE1D1A77D0CD98">
its con&s;truction, the awful maje&s;ty of &s;o va&s;t a pile, half perfect, half in ruin, impre&s;s one with a tumult of &s;entiments which it is difficult to convey to you by a|ny de&s;cription.</P>
<P>The "mai&s;on quarr&eacute;e," is in the mo&s;t complete pre&s;ervation, and appears to me to be the mo&s;t perfect piece of architecture in the world. The order is the Corinthian, and all the beauties of that elegant &s;tyle &s;eem to be exhau&s;ted in its con&s;truction. This &s;u|perb temple is now converted into a chapel dedicated to the Virgin, ornamented with gilding and other ho|ly finery, &s;uitable to &s;uch an alteration.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. LXV. OF THE FERTILITY OF THE COUNTRY BE|TWEEN BOURDEAUX AND AGEN.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I left Bourdeaux I took the road to Agen, along the &s;outhern bank of the Garonne. The coun|try through which I pa&s;&s;ed from Langon, where I cro&s;|&s;ed the Garonne, to the gates of that city, is fertile be|yond any I have &s;een in Europe. The hills are all covered with vineyards to the &s;ummit, and the vallies &s;carce require the indu&s;try of the pea&s;ants to produce in plenty whatever is nece&s;&s;ary for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tance.
<PB N="80" REF="031692_0403_0FEE1D1C03A3B788">
The climate at this &s;ea&s;on is delicious; and no marks of winter appear in any of the productions of nature. Cherry-trees, figs, acacias, poplars, and elms, are in full verdure. In many places, where they border on the &s;ide of the road, the vines have run up, and mixed their clu&s;ters among the boughs. This is truly beau|tiful and picture&s;que. Milton, in his divine flights of imagination, could employ our fir&s;t parents in no more delightful occupation, even in Paradi&s;e.</P>

</LG>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this charming country, in a plain, clo&s;e to the Garonne, &s;tands the city of Agen. Be|hind it, to the north, ri&s;es a very high hill, called "Le Bocher de la belle Vue." I went up to the &s;um|mit, on which there is a convent. The chapel and &s;ome of the adjoining cells are hallowed out of the rock. It is &s;aid that the&s;e apartments are very ancient, and were made many centuries ago by hermits, who retir|ed thither from motives of devotion and au&s;terity. The pro&s;pect is beautiful. Beneath lies the city of A|gen, and through the meadows which &s;urround it rolls the Garonne.</P>
<P>One of the monks &s;howed me the apartments of the
<PB N="81" REF="031692_0404_0FEE1D1F6619E418">
convent; and in the rece&s;&s;es of the rock heled me to a &s;pring which is never dry, and which he a&s;&s;ured me had been opened by miracle, at the interce&s;&s;ion of &s;ome holy reclu&s;e in ages pa&s;t. Their little refectory was hung with portraits of the &s;ame mona&s;tic heroes, among which was St. William, duke of Aquitaine; and at the upper end, in golden letters, was written, "Silentium."</P>
<P>Agen is a very mean and di&s;agreeable place, the hou&s;es are ill built, the &s;treets narrow, crooked, and dirty. I &s;aw only one building in it which appeared to me de&s;erving of notice. It is a chapel belonging to a nunery of Carmelites. The walls are exqui&s;itely painted in chiaro o&s;curo, and the deception of the roof, which is executed in the &s;ame manner, is admirable. The high altar is magnificent, and adorned with a piece of painting, the &s;ubject of which is very inter|e&s;ting. It is a nun, &s;inking under the tran&s;ports of holy contemplation. She appears as if incapable of &s;upporting the divine effulgence of her cele&s;tial lover, with eyes half clo&s;ed, and arms expanded. Above, de|&s;cends a radiant figure, with looks of tenderne&s;s and plea&s;ure, &s;urrounded with the glories of the &s;kies, too &s;trong for motal &s;ight. If it had not been a religious edifice, I &s;hould have &s;uppo&s;ed it to be the &s;tory of Jupiter and Semel&eacute;, to which it bears the mo&s;t apt re|&s;emblance. Near the piece is this in&s;cription.</P>

<P>Here one cannot help being &s;truck with the ju&s;tice of a remark, which has often been made on the inti|mate alliance between love and devotion, when carri|ed to an exce&s;s. The &s;ame enthu&s;ia&s;m, the &s;ame melt|ing language, the &s;ame overpowering delights, are com|mon to both pa&s;&s;ions. Love, &s;ays Rou&s;&s;eau, in extreme, borrows the language of Devotion; and Devotion, in her flights, adopts the expre&s;&s;ions of attachment and fondne&s;s.</P>
<P>We are u&s;ed to apprehend the condition of a young women who has taken the veil to be very mi&s;erable. Where convenience, or chagrin, or melancholy, are the motives to this act of &s;elf-dedication, I fully con|cur in that opinion; but there are women, I doubt not, who, in the gloom of a convent, amid &s;hrines and crucifixes, are yet &s;upremely happy. Married to a hea|venly &s;pou&s;e, and dedicated to the embraces of a &s;u|perior and invi&s;ible being, Enthu&s;ia&s;m has ample room to exert her powers, and rai&s;e her votary above the poor gratifications of earth.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. LXVI. AN ACCOUNT OF THE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT LEAD INTO ITALY.</HEAD>
<P>IF you enter Italy by the way of France, you will probably go to Lyon. From thence you have your choice, either to go by land through Savoy, and acro&s;s Mount Cenis to Turin; or pa&s;&s;ing through Provence, to embark at Antibes or Nice, for Genoa or Leghorn. From Swi&s;&s;erland you may pa&s;s Mount S. Gothard; from the Valais, Mount S. Bernard; and from Ger|many you may go through the Tyrol. Carriages can pa&s;s only by the fir&s;t and la&s;t of the&s;e routes. In cro&s;|&s;ing Mount Cenis they mu&s;t be taken to pieces; but the whole road through the Tyrol is not merely practi|cable, but even excellent for a carriage.</P>
<P>From Lyon to Turin they reckon thirty-five po&s;ts, &s;ixty-four leagues, or one hundred and ninety-three Engli&s;h miles; the time, fifty-&s;ix hours. The road pa&s;&s;es through the Lyonnois, Savoy, and Peidmont, by Pont-Beauvoi&s;in and Chambery over Mount Cenis.</P>
<P>Pont-Beauvoi&s;in, which is fifteen leagues or nine po&s;ts from Lyon, is on the frontier; a little river &s;eparates it into two parts, one of which belongs to France, and the other to Savoy:</P>
<P>No &s;ooner have you pa&s;&s;ed the frontiers of France,
<PB N="84" REF="031692_0407_0FEE1D2975E77FE0">
than you perceive a change of country, climate, and people. The mountains of Savoy afford a new &s;cene. Woods, rocks, precipices, ca&s;cades and torrents, form views that charm an eye fond of rude nature. Others find this journey dreary and di&s;agreeable. The road, however, is &s;afe and good, and in many places even beautiful. From Pont-Beauvoi&s;in you go to Cham|bery, which, though the capital of Savoy, affords no|thing worth &s;eeing. The &s;ituation indeed is fine, in a wide delightful valley, where there is the greate&s;t va|riety of objects that a fine country and mountains can produce: but it is a poor dirty town; the hou&s;es dark, the &s;treets narrow, the convents and other public buil|dings mi&s;erable. The remainder of the ducal palace is a ca&s;tle; over the gate-way are the governor's lodg|ings, commanding the town and adjacent country. During the carnival they have plays and ma&s;ked balls.</P>
<P>If in&s;tead of taking the direct route you go by Gene|va, you will find it nineteen po&s;ts, or ninety-five miles three furlongs from Lyon to that place, the time twen|ty one or twenty-two hours. From Geneva to Cham|bery it is &s;even po&s;ts, or forty-&s;ix miles and a half; and the time thirteen or fourteen hours. This there|fore is &s;eventy-two miles out of the way, and will take &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen hours more in time. But if you have already &s;een Paris and Lyon, there is a road from Calais to Dijon, by S. Omer, Arras, Cambray, Laon,
<PB N="85" REF="031692_0408_0FEE1D30768175F0">
Rheims, Chalon &s;ur Marne, Joinville, and Langres, which is &s;ixty-&s;ix po&s;ts, or three hundred and fifty-one Engli&s;h miles; and from Dijon to Geneva, by Auxone, Dole, Poligny, and from Morey acro&s;s Mount Jura to Nyon, twenty-one po&s;ts: the time of the whole route about eighty-one hours. Whereas by Paris and Lyon, it will co&s;t you one hundred and two hours; but dur|ing four or five months Mount Jura is impracticable.</P>
<P>From Geneva, your be&s;t way is to hire hor&s;es to con|vey you to Chambery, there being very few hor&s;es on the road till you come into the direct way fram France. It is &s;even po&s;ts from Geneva to Chambery, and the voiturier will be at lea&s;t twelve hours in going them, unle&s;s your carriage is light. If you think this too much for one day, you may &s;et out in the afternoon from Geneva, lay at Frangy, and arrive ea&s;ily at Cham|bery the next day, time enough to &s;ee that place.</P>
<P>Montmelian, which is only a po&s;t and a half, or nine miles from Chambery, is al&s;o mo&s;t delightfully &s;itua|ted at the head of three vallies. The inn is not in the town, but half a league on this &s;ide of it, and the a&s;cent from it is very &s;teep. Having pa&s;&s;ed the mountain, the road lies in a very narrow valley which winds in|ce&s;&s;antly. The wine made about Montmelian is much e&s;teemed. After this you meet with nothing but wretched towns and villages, and a country of terrible poverty and filth. The hone&s;t, plain, and thrifty Sa|voyards
<PB N="86" REF="031692_0409_0FEE1D32029F91E0">
have very little land to cultivate, and look ex|tremely unhealthy. Aiguebelle lies in a bottom clo&s;e|ly &s;urrounded by mountains. It is but a poor &s;trag|gling village. The water is clear, light, and &s;parkling.</P>
<P>After you have pa&s;&s;ed Aiguebelle, <HI>goitres</HI> or &s;welled necks become frequent. St. Jean de Maurienne was formerly the re&s;idence of the counts of this country. It is &s;ituated in the middle of the highe&s;t Alps, in a valley tolerable wide. The roads are pretty good, ex|cept through the towns, where they are ill paved, and barely wide enough for a carriage to pa&s;s. Indeed they are in general narrow, which is no wonder, where there is &s;o little land to &s;pare. Frequently you find no more than room for this confined way between the &s;teep mountain and the torrent; and in &s;ome places they are obliged to hew it out of the rock it&s;elf. Whenever the valley widens a little, you find a mi&s;erable village; and &s;ome of the&s;e, as if it were to &s;pare their u&s;eful land for cultivation, are placed in the very bed of the torrent, which occupies &s;o large a portion of all that is not bar|ren rock. The road is almo&s;t a continued a&s;cent and de&s;cent by the &s;ide of the Arche, a river which ri&s;es in Mount I&s;erau, and joins the I&s;ere near Montmelian. As you advance, the mountains grow higher and more &s;teep, till at length the road clo&s;es in a narrow gorge, and a very long and heavy a&s;cent to Lannebourg, which is at the foot of Mount Cenis. There are about
<PB N="87" REF="031692_0410_0FEE1D338AF8F9A8">
two hundred and twenty hou&s;es in this village, and a|bout one hundred porters on the Syndic's li&s;t, who are employed in their turns.</P>
<P>The inns on this road are very bad; it is therefore advi&s;eable, if you can bear the fatigue, to go through without &s;topping. You &s;hould by all means have the whole day before you to cro&s;s Mount Cenis, that you may not be hurried in the double operation of taking your carriage to pieces, and putting it together again; and that you may have time in the evening to arrive at Suze; in which ca&s;e the next day you will ea&s;ily reach Turin to dinner. The whole pa&s;&s;age of the mountain from Lannebourg to Novalize may ea&s;ily be accompli&s;hed in four or at mo&s;t five hours; and has nothing terrible in it; at lea&s;t from May to October. In a deep &s;now, in a violent tempe&s;t, and e&s;pecially in a great thaw, there is certainly &s;ome danger; at all oth|er times there is nothing but the inconvenience of tak|ing the carriage in pieces, to &s;end it over the moun|tain on mules; but the people are &s;o adroit in this op|eration, and re&s;tore it to its primitive &s;tate &s;o ea&s;ily, that the whole rather furni&s;hes amu&s;ement than gives pain to the traveller.</P>
<P>You have it in your option to pa&s;s over on mu&s;es or in <HI>chai&s;es-a-porteurs,</HI> which is ru&s;h-bottomed elbow chairs, without legs. Two men carry them by means of two poles, and they have a foot-board. The&s;e fel|lows
<PB N="88" REF="031692_0411_0FEE1D38C736A248">
are very &s;trong and nimble, never mi&s;&s;ing a &s;tep, but treading firm in the roughe&s;t ways with the agili|ty of goats. They relieve each other at proper inter|vals. In de&s;cending, they &s;how great dexterity in the frequent windings of the mountain. From &s;ix to ten of the&s;e men are a&s;&s;igned to each per&s;on, in proportion to his &s;ize. Their pay is fifty &s;ols of Savoy each, that is about two &s;hillings and &s;even-pence halfpennny. The price of a mule to carry the baggage is the &s;ame: of a mule to ride, forty &s;ols, or two &s;hillings and a pen|ny. A mule is not obliged to carry above 350lb. &s;o that if the body of your carriage exceeds that weight, they may demand what they plea&s;e. There is al&s;o one &s;edan chair at Suze, which may generally be had by &s;ending notice before hand to the other &s;ide of the mountain; and lately they have provided other cover|ed chairs. The a&s;cent is not bad, and is ea&s;ily perform|ed in an hour and a half. At the top is a plain, about five miles in length; it is a fine turf, and may be gal|loped over, not only with perfect &s;afety, but with plea|&s;ure. There is a beautiful lake on this plain, with ex|cellent trout in it.</P>
<P>It is often related, as a wonderful circum&s;tance, that there &s;hould be a lake on the top of Mount Cenis; but the truth is, that this plain is no more than a very high valley or gorge of the mountain; and though it be indeed the highe&s;t part which travellers pa&s;s over,
<PB N="89" REF="031692_0412_0FEE1D3C283EDB40">
yet there are lofty pikes which ri&s;e at lea&s;t three thou|&s;and feet above it. The lake is &s;upplied from the &s;now that melts on the&s;e, and trickles through the crevices. It gives ri&s;e to the river Dora, and therefore may be looked upon as one of the &s;ources of the Po. You may &s;top at a public hou&s;e by the ho&s;pital to refre&s;h the men; and having traver&s;ed the plain, you begin to de|&s;cend into Piedmont. The pro&s;pect on each &s;ide of tall firs, larches, and che&s;nuts, of natural water-falls and roaring mountain rivers, affords a variety at once awful and plea&s;ing. From the plain of S. Nicholas you have a view of a beautiful ca&s;cade; and half way between the great cro&s;s and Novaleze you pa&s;s a wretched village, called La Ferriere. You will be two hours at lea&s;t in getting to Novaleze. The de&s;cent is &s;teep, but no where dangerous.</P>
<P>Some adventurous people, who return from Italy by the way of Mount Cenis in winter, when the moun|tain is covered with &s;now, &s;lide down on &s;ledges. The de&s;cent towards Lannebourg is very &s;teep, and it takes almo&s;t an hour to go down it, on account of the ma|ny turnings and windings you are obliged to make; but the whole &s;ide of the mountain being then covered with one &s;olid &s;mooth cru&s;t of &s;now, at the proper place you may put your&s;elf on a &s;ledge, with a guide on the fore part of it, who will conduct it, and change the direction of it with his foot, whenever it is nece&s;&s;a|ry,
<PB N="90" REF="031692_0413_0FEE1D3F881F6FF0">
and thus bring you to the bottom in ten or twelve minutes very &s;afe; or if the &s;ledge now and then over|turns, they &s;ay it is without any bad con&s;equence. This is called in French, "&s;e faire rama&s;&s;er," and the place whence you &s;et out, "les rama&s;&s;es." Novaleze is a poor place, with an indifferent inn, where is the fir&s;t cu&s;tom-hou&s;e for Piedmont; and a &s;tranger mu&s;t take care not to have &s;nuff, or any new foreign com|modities.</P>
<P>You will quit this place if you had not time to reach Suze the evening before, by nine or ten in the morn|ing, that you may have the day before you, and be &s;ure to arrive at Turin before ten o'clock, after which hour the gates are not opened. The road to Suze is rough and bad, with a &s;teep a&s;cent and de&s;cent, and the town is not con&s;iderable. You will pa&s;s the formidable for|tre&s;s of the Brunetta, along a narrow gorge of the mountain. This is the barrier of Italy, and the key of Piedmont. The fortifications are &s;aid to be well worth &s;eeing, but it is difficult to obtain the permi&s;&s;ion. At Suze, in the gardens of the ca&s;tle, is a triumphal arch, erected in the time of Augu&s;tus.</P>
<P>At Rivoli, which is only two leagues from Turin, the King of Sardinia has a country hou&s;e. From hence to the capital is a hand&s;ome broad &s;traight road, bordered by double rows of fine elms. There are &s;ome wild and magnificent views between Mount Cenis and Turin;
<PB N="91" REF="031692_0414_0FEE1D4110A8ADD0">
and the meadows in &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons are equal in point of verdure to any in England. They are watered by the Dora, which de&s;cends with va&s;t impetuo&s;ity from the Alps.</P>

<P>MEDIOCRITY is rare here; everything is in extremes. No where is &s;o fine mu&s;ic to be heard; no where (ex|cept at the opera of Paris) are the ears &s;o cruelly tor|tured. The eyes are charmed and tormented alternate|ly by the mo&s;t &s;uperb and mo&s;t dete&s;table pictures and &s;tatues. No citizens; and exce&s;&s;ive luxury among&s;t in|dividuals; and the people in the mo&s;t abject mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>It is the &s;ame with regard to religion; you will &s;ee nothing but a blind &s;uper&s;tition, or determined athei&s;ts. But of all the extremes, the mo&s;t &s;triking are tho&s;e which are ob&s;erved in the character of the nation. The Italian, in general, is exceedingly good or wicked to a degree. There are excellent hearts in this country; but like the great pictures they are &s;carce. Men are born there with &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, and not receiving any education, it is not a&s;toni&s;hing that they often commit great crimes. Under a cold exterior they conceal burn|ing
<PB N="92" REF="031692_0415_0FEE1D481730FB30">
hearts; and the exterior is cold only to conceal their hearts. Love, jealou&s;y, and revenge are their ruling pa&s;&s;ions. As they think only of the &s;en&s;ual part of love, and know well the con&s;titutions of their women, and the wiles of their rivals, their jealou&s;y is always a|wake and their revenge is implacable.</P>
<P>As to under&s;tanding, it is nearly the &s;ame; men of talants form the large cla&s;s; there are few fools; and middling men are very rare. "Why then, you will a&s;k, do not the&s;e men produce nothing excellent?" Be|cau&s;e they have ungoverned imaginations, and no phy|lo&s;ophy; and becau&s;e good ta&s;te has not yet penetrated into their country. And why has not good ta&s;te enter|ed Italy? Becau&s;e Italy has neither a London nor a Pa|ris, and becau&s;e &s;he never had a Lewis the Fourteenth.</P>
<P>Travellers are often mi&s;taken in judging of the Itali|an, e&s;pecially the Neapolitan. They think he has no &s;en&s;e, becau&s;e he wants ideas. A man can have but few ideas when he has never been out of his own coun|try, and when he has read nothing; but examine the Neapolitan on all the &s;ubjects with which he is acquain|ed, and you will &s;ee whether he wants natural capa|city. He re&s;embles the &s;oil of his own country. A field well tilled in Naples produces the mo&s;t plentiful crops; neglected, it yields but briars and thi&s;tles. It is the &s;ame with the genius of the inhabitants; cultivated, it is capable of every thing; untilled produces only folly and vice.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. LXVIII. TWO CURIOUS REMARKS.</HEAD>
<P>I MADE two ob&s;ervations in my travels; one that the people of every country make &s;omething well; the other, that every nation has a peculiar manner of ruin|ing it&s;elf. The Engli&s;h ruin them&s;elves by play; the French, by women; the Iri&s;h by a ho&s;pitality; the Swi&s;s, by drinking; and the Germans, by a multitude of &s;ervants. I &s;hould not have &s;aid <HI>every</HI> I &s;hould have &s;ad <HI>almo&s;t</HI> every. The Italians don't ruin them&s;elves, becau&s;e they are ruined already. However, individu|als among them <HI>do;</HI> &s;ome Milane&s;e, for example, by eating; &s;ome Venetians, by gallantry and gaming; &s;ome Neapolitans by equipages and embroidery; and &s;everal Romans, by every &s;pecies of impurity. Nei|ther do the Dutch ruin them&s;elves; it is not, however, becau&s;e they are already ruined, but becau&s;e they are too phlegmatic to ruin them&s;elves any way. The few who <HI>do</HI> de&s;troy them&s;elves, do it by avarice, by lending money at exorbitant intere&s;t on bad &s;ecurities.</P>
<P>There are Dutchmen too who ruin them&s;elves by flowers. I do not guaranty the truth of this anecdote, though I heard it from per&s;ons of veracity in Holland. A man, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ion was for flowers, and who had an uncommon fine tulip-root of a very particular kind,
<PB N="94" REF="031692_0417_0FEE1D4B28A80138">
heard that another flori&s;t had one as fine as his. He purcha&s;ed it from him for a &s;um of money &s;o large, I dare not mention it; and when he had got it into his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he broke it to pieces with his heel, &s;aying, "Now there is not in the world another tulip-root equal to mine."</P>
<P>Every nation excells too in making &s;omething. The French make gold and &s;ilver &s;tuffs, and political lies better than any people in the world. The Italians make ices, maccaroni, and religious lies to admiration. The Saxons make excellent porcelaine. The Dutch are fa|mous for making &s;ea-land&s;capes. The Flemi&s;h for making lace. And the Engli&s;h&mdash;why the Engli&s;h, I, think, make men and women better than any nation I know.</P>
<P>There is a better race of men and women in England then I have ever &s;een in any other country. If any one a&s;ks me <HI>why</HI> it is &s;o? I an&s;wer, I can't tell. If he a&s;ks me how I <HI>know</HI> that it is &s;o? I an&s;wer, by looking at them. There is al&s;o a better race of dogs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Not to &s;peak of a great many promi&s;ing puppies.</NOTE> and hor|&s;es here than in any other country I have &s;een; but there are too a great many garrons and curs.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. LXIX. THE REASONS WHY THE FRENCH HAVE MORE WIT AND BETTER SPIRITS THAN THE ENGLISH.</HEAD>
<P>SIR, &s;ays a man to Swift, I have a mind to &s;et up for a Wit. Sir, &s;ays Swift, I advi&s;e you to &s;it down again. This was very good advice, particularly in this coun|try, where that &s;ame author has ob&s;erved, not one man in ten thou&s;and has wit. Almo&s;t every body is witty in France. Why then there, and not here? The rea|&s;ons are purely phy&s;ical; for Engli&s;hmen ought to have twenty times more wit than Frenchmen.</P>
<P>Ideas are the matter of which wit is made, and the Engli&s;h have infinitely more ideas than the French. This ari&s;es from their early education, from their be|ing a more reading people, &amp;c. You &s;ee this is a very &s;trong rea&s;on why the Engli&s;h ought to be &s;uperior to the French in this point.</P>
<P>But if ideas are the materials, fancy is the in&s;trument which operates on tho&s;e materials; and here comes in the &s;uperiority of the French. Their fancies are liveli|er, brighter, and quicker.</P>
<P>The force of the imagination depends a great deal on the influence of the animal &s;pirits; its brightne&s;s
<PB N="96" REF="031692_0419_0FEE1D559FFA2070">
on the refinement of tho&s;e &s;pirits: and its quickne&s;s on the celerity of their movement. Now, in point of co|piou&s;ne&s;s of &s;pirits, the Engli&s;h, I believe, have the ad|vantage of the French. A bull has more &s;pirits in him than an ape; but the ape's &s;pirits are always in motion, and it is very difficult to move the bull's. This, you &s;ee, is a ca&s;e in point: and John Bull, I am per&s;uaded, has a greater quantity of &s;pirits than <HI>Jack Singe.</HI> But the Frenchman's &s;pirits are more refined and quicker in their motions than ours, and this for a number of rea&s;ons. I &s;hall here mention &s;ome of the principal.</P>
<P>A Frenchman never ta&s;tes malt liquor, he eats no butter, and his bread is light. The meat in France is not near &s;o fat as it is here, and it is much better dre&s;|&s;ed. The &s;auces are poignant and not grea&s;y. He eats a great deal of &s;oup and light vegetables. He drinks in moderation as much wine and water as is nec&s;&s;ary to dilute his dinner, and then he takes as much <HI>good</HI> wine, coffee, and <HI>liqueurs,</HI> as is nece&s;&s;ary to heat his &s;tomach, and quicken the circulation of his blood, <HI>and no more.</HI> Add to this, the purene&s;s of the air, and the light &s;ocie|ty of the mo&s;t amiable women in the world, in which he pa&s;&s;es &s;o much of his time; and you will &s;ee rea|&s;ons enough why his &s;pirits &s;hould be quicker in their motion, and more refined than ours.</P>
<P>I need not mention how oppo&s;ite our manner of liv|ing is; the quantities of blood-food we eat, the quanti|ty
<PB N="97" REF="031692_0420_0FEE1D57288CAD20">
of bad wine we drink, the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of our atmo&s;|phere, nor many other cau&s;es that hinder the celerity of our fancies, and con&s;equently impede con&s;iderably the vivacity of our wit.</P>
<P>However, the Engli&s;h do not think much of the &s;u|periority of the French in this article. They pique them&s;elves on having better &s;en&s;e and more learning than their neighbours; and they have more &s;en&s;e and learning. The French allow this, and it does not give them any unea&s;ine&s;s. They value them&s;elves on be|ing wittier and more amiable than the Engli&s;h. When a Frenchman has knowledge, and is grown a little &s;teady, his company is delightful; when an Engli&s;h|man has fancy and good manners, his &s;ociety is en|chanting. I always thought that tho&s;e two nations, blended together, would produce perfection in every thing.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. LXX. OF EDINBURGH. A. D. 1774.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ituation of Edinburgh is probably as extraor|dinary an one as can well be imagined for a metropolis. The immen&s;e hills, on which great part of it is built, though they make the views uncommonly magnificent,
<PB N="98" REF="031692_0421_0FEE1D5A8B352FB8">
not only in many places render it impa&s;&s;able for car|riages, but very fatiguing for walking. The principal or great &s;treet runs along the ridge of a very high hill, which, taking its ri&s;e from the palace of Holyrood hou&s;e, a&s;cends, and not very gradually, for the length of a mile and a quarter, and after opening a &s;pacious area, terminates in the ca&s;tle. On one &s;ide, far as the eye can reach, you view the &s;ea, the port of Leith, its harbour and various ve&s;&s;els, the river of Forth, the im|men&s;e hills around, &s;ome of which a&s;cend above even the ca&s;tle; and on the other &s;ide you look over a rich and cultivated country, terminated by the dark, abrupt, and barren hills of the Highlands.</P>
<P>The famous &s;treet at Li&s;le, la Rue Royale, leading to the port of Tourney, which is &s;aid to be the fine&s;t in Europe, is not to be compared, either in length or breadth, to the High-&s;treet at Edinburgh; and would they be at the expence of removing &s;ome buildings which ob&s;truct the view, by being placed in the mid|dle of the &s;treet, nothing could be conceived more magnificent. Not content, however, with this, they &s;uffer a weekly market to be held, in which &s;talls are erected nearly the whole length of it, and make a con|fu&s;ion almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to be conceived. All &s;orts of iron and copper ware are expo&s;ed to &s;ale; here likewi&s;e the herb market is held, and the herb women, who are in no country either the mo&s;t peaceable or the mo&s;t
<PB N="99" REF="031692_0422_0FEE1D5E0C9B0918">
cleanly beings upon earth, throw about the roots, &s;talks, &amp;c. of the bad vegetables, to the great nui&s;ance of the pa&s;&s;engers.</P>
<P>The &s;tyle of building here is much like the French. The hou&s;es, however, in general are higher, as &s;ome ri&s;e to twelve, and one in particular to thirteen &s;tories in heighth. But to the front of the &s;treet nine or ten &s;tories is the common run. It is the back part of the edifice, which, by being built on the &s;lope of an hill, &s;inks to that amazing debth, &s;o as to form the above number. This mode of dwelling, though very proper for the turbulent times to which it was adapted, has now lo&s;t its convenience. As they no longer &s;tand in need of defence from the ca&s;tle, they no more find the benefit of being crowded together &s;o near it. The com|mon &s;tairca&s;e, which leads to the apartments of the different inhabitants, mu&s;t always be dirty, and is in general very dark and narrow. It has this advantage, however, that as they are all of &s;tone they have little to apprehend from fire, which in the opinion of &s;ome, would more than compen&s;ate for every other di&s;advan|tage. In general, however, the highe&s;t and lowe&s;t ten|ements are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the artificers, while the gentry and better &s;ort of people dwell in fifth and &s;ixth &s;tories.</P>
<P>In London &s;uch an habitation would not be deem|ed the mo&s;t elegible, and many a man in &s;uch a &s;itua|tion would not be &s;orry to de&s;cend a little lower. The
<PB N="100" REF="031692_0423_0FEE22580521FAE8">
&s;tyle of building here has given ri&s;e to different ideas. Some years ago, a Scotch gentleman, who went to Lon|don for the fir&s;t time, took the uppermo&s;t &s;tory of a lodging-hou&s;e, and was very much &s;urpri&s;ed to find what he thought the genteele&s;t place in the whole at the lowe&s;t price. His friends who came to &s;ee him, in vain acquainted him with the mi&s;take he had ben guil|ty of: "He ken'd very weel," he &s;aid, what gentility was, and when he had liv&eacute;d all his life in a &s;ixth &s;tory, he was not come to London to live upon the ground."</P>
<P>From the right of the High-&s;treet you pa&s;s over a very long bridge to the New Town. Before this bridge was built, you had a very &s;teep hill to de&s;cend and to a&s;cend, which was found extremely inconvenient. A &s;ub&s;cription therefore was entered into to build one: and a mo&s;t &s;tupendous work it is indeed. It is thrown over this immen&s;e valley; and as no water runs under it, you have the whole effect of its heighth. From it you have a fine view up and down the vale, and the pro&s;pect through the middle arch is inconceivably beautiful. Not long ago a part of this bridge gave way and many people who were upon it &s;unk into the cha&s;m, and were buried in the ruins. Many others, who were likewi&s;e upon the bridge, &s;aw the fate of their unfortunate companions, without being able to a&s;&s;i&s;t them. All was terror and con&s;ternation. Every one fled from this &s;cene of death as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, expect|ing
<PB N="101" REF="031692_0424_0FEE211D09D735F8">
the bridge to &s;ink under them at every &s;tep, and them&s;elves to be cru&s;hed to pieces. When the bridge was cleared, and the general con&s;ternation had a little &s;ub&s;ided, it was found that only a &s;mall part had given way, which they are now repairing, and making &s;trong|er than ever. But &s;o great was the fear it occa&s;ioned a|mong&s;t all ranks of people, that many of them look upon it with terror even to this day, and make it an objection to re&s;iding in the New Town, that they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily pa&s;s over it.</P>
<P>The New Town has been built upon one uniform plan, which is the only means of making a city beauti|ful. Great part of this plan as yet remains to be exe|cuted, though they proceed as fa&s;t as their &s;upplies of money will allow them: The rent of the hou&s;es in ge|neral amounts to an hundred pounds per annum, or upwards, and are mo&s;t of them let to the inhabitants by builders, who buy the ground, and make what ad|vantage they can of it. The greate&s;t part of the New Town is built after the manner of the Engli&s;h, and the hou&s;es are what they call here "hou&s;es to them&s;elves." Though this mode of living, one would imagine, is much preferable to the former, yet &s;uch is the force of prejudice, that there are many people who prefer a lit|tle dark confined tenement on a &s;ixth &s;tory, to the con|venience of a whole hou&s;e. One old lady fancies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hould be lo&s;t if &s;he was to get into &s;uch an habitation,
<PB N="102" REF="031692_0425_0FEE211E922D6588">
another, that &s;he &s;hould be blown away in going over the new bridge; and a third lives in the old &s;tyle, be|cau&s;e &s;he is &s;ure that the&s;e new fa&s;hions can come to "nae gude." But different as the&s;e &s;entiments are in regard to living, they are not more different than the buildings them&s;elves. In no town that I ever &s;aw can &s;uch a contra&s;t be found betwixt the modern and anci|ent architecture, or any thing that better merits the ob|&s;ervation of a &s;tranger.</P>
<P>The pavement of the whole town is excellent. The granite, which long &s;upplied London, till Jer&s;ey and Guern&s;ey robbed them of tho&s;e advantages, is dug from the hills clo&s;e to the town, and brought at very &s;mall expence. Maitland, in his hi&s;tory of this town, calls it "grey marble;" but without di&s;puting about the propriety of the name, every one mu&s;t allow it the very be&s;t &s;tone po&s;&s;ible for the purpo&s;e. They fini&s;h it with an exactne&s;s which the London workmen are indiffer|ent about, and which indeed London would not admit of, from the number of weighty carriages that continu|ally go over it.</P>
<P>From the left of the High-&s;treet you pa&s;s down by a number of different allies, or as they call them here, wynds and clo&s;&s;es, to the different parts of the old town: They are many of them &s;o very &s;teep, that it requires great attention to the feet to prevent falling; but &s;o well accu&s;tomed are the Scotch to that po&s;ition

<P>This town has long been reproached with many un|cleanly cu&s;toms. A gentleman, who lately publi&s;hed his travels through Spain, &s;ays, "that Madrid, &s;ome years ago, might have vied with Edinburgh in filthi|ne&s;s." It may probably be &s;ome plea&s;ure to this au|thor, and to tho&s;e who read him, to learn that his re|marks are now very erroneous.</P>
<P>But if a &s;tranger may be allowed to complain, it would be, that in the&s;e wynds, which are very numer|ous, the dirt is &s;ometimes &s;uffered to remain two or three days without removal, and becomes offen&s;ive to more &s;en&s;es than one. The magi&s;trates by impo&s;ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">es and other puni&s;hments, have long put a &s;top to the throwing any thing from the windows into the o|pen &s;treet. But as the&s;e alleys are unlighted, narrow, and removed from public view, they &s;till continue the&s;e practices with impunity. Many an elegant &s;uit of clothes has been &s;poiled: many a powdered well-dre&s;&s;|ed maccaroni &s;ent home for the evening; and to con|clude this period in Dr. Joh&s;on's own &s;imple words, "Many a full-flowing periwig moi&s;tened into flacidi|ty."</P>

<HEAD>SECT. LXXI. A SINGULAR ANECDOTE.</HEAD>
<P>ON our fir&s;t arrival at Edinburgh, my companion and &s;elf, after the fatigue of a long day's journey, upon enquiring for an inn, were taken to a hou&s;e, where we were conducted by a girl without &s;hoes or &s;tock|ings, and with only a &s;ingle lin&s;ey-woollen petticoat, which ju&s;t reached half-way to her ancles, into a room where about twenty Scotch drovers had been regaling them&s;elves with whi&s;ky and potatoes. You may gue&s;s our amazement, when we were informed, "that this was the be&s;t inn in the metropolis&mdash;that we could have no beds, unle&s;s we had an inclination to &s;leep together; and in the &s;ame room with the company, which a &s;tage, coach had that moment di&s;charged." Well, &s;aid I to my friend, (for I have more patience on the&s;e occa&s;i|ons, than wit on any other) there is nothing like &s;ee|ing men and manners; perhaps we may be able to re|po&s;e our&s;elves at &s;ome coffee hou&s;e. Accordingly, on enquiry, we di&s;covered that there was a good dame by the Cro&s;s, who acted in the double capacity of pour|ing out coffee, or letting lodgings to &s;trangers as we were. She was ea&s;ily to be found out; and with all the conciliating complai&s;ance of a Maitre&s;&s;e d'Hotel,
<PB N="106" REF="031692_0429_0FEE212DE9AA1B70">
conducted us to our de&s;tined apartments, which were indeed &s;ix &s;tories high; but &s;o infernal to appearance, that you would have thought your&s;elf in the regions of Erebus. The truth of this, I will venture to &s;ay, you will make no &s;cruple to believe, when I tell you, that in the whole we had only two windows, which looked into an alley five feet wide, where the hou&s;es were at lea&s;t ten &s;tories high, and the alley it&s;elf was &s;o &s;ombre in the brighte&s;t &s;un-&s;hine, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ee any object di&s;tinctly.</P>
<P>And now I am in the &s;tory-telling humour, I can|not omit giving an account of an adventure which happened here very lately to a friend of mine; as it tallies in &s;ome mea&s;ure with what I have already rela|ted, and &s;erves to confirm the wretchedne&s;s of accom|modation which mu&s;t be put up within this city. A gentleman from London, who had been appointed to &s;ome duty in a public office, came to Edinburgh, and having no friends to furni&s;h him with a bed, and few acquaintances to give him any a&s;&s;i&s;tance, found him|&s;elf obliged to conceal him&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> in one of the&s;e dark a|bodes, in order to be nigh the centre of the town, where his employment compelled him to pa&s;s mo&s;t part of the day. As he perceived his lodgings as good as his neighbours, it induced him to continue there until he di&s;covered him&s;elf extremely weak and emaciated, oc|ca&s;ioned by con&s;tant violent per&s;pirations, in which be

waked every morning. The ob&s;ervation which &s;ome of his a&s;&s;ociates made on the alteration of his <HI>embonpoint,</HI> and the &s;ituation to which he was reduced, (for from a &s;tout and lu&s;ty man he was now become a mere &s;ha|dow) per&s;uaded him to think him&s;elf really ill, and in a con&s;umption. Accordingly he &s;ent for the Profe&s;&s;or, and another or two of the learned fraternity, who, with all the &s;ignificancy of pompous phy&s;ic, pronounced him to be in a very declining &s;tate, and admini&s;tered every re&s;torative which the AE&s;culapian art could &s;ugge&s;t or &s;upply. But all without effect. He &s;till continued to grow wor&s;e; and at length, almo&s;t totally exhau&s;ted, and giving him&s;elf a prey to de&s;pair, he &s;ent up for his landlady to be a witne&s;s to his will; who, much con|cerned for the melancholy event, and with tears in her eyes, &s;aid, "How unfortunate &s;he had been &s;ince &s;he kept hou&s;e; that her two former lodges had died with her; that &s;he was &s;ure &s;he did every thing to &s;erve them all; that for her part, &s;he always took care that their linen was well aired; and as for her rooms, nothing could be drier or more free from dampne&s;s; that her neighbour, good man, was a baker, and his oven was di|rectly under them; that &s;he was &s;ure; therefore, they mu&s;t be warm, and it was impo&s;&s;ible to catch cold in her hou&s;e."&mdash;"Good God," cried the gentleman, "an oven under my room! no wonder I am in a con|&s;umption

Upon which he &s;ent for the baker, and found what &s;he &s;aid was really true; that the oven was immediately under his bed, and that the decrea&s;e of his health had been in proportion to the increa&s;e of the baker's bu&s;ine&s;s. The di&s;covery, therefore, being a much better medicine than any the profe&s;&s;ors could pre&s;cribe, he quitted this <HI>enfer,</HI> by degrees recovered his &s;trength and con&s;titution, and lives now to ridicule the oddity of the accident.</P>
<P>After all this, I am &s;ure every one will agree with me, that it is extremely &s;trange, that a city, which is a thorough fare into all Scotland, and now little inferior in politene&s;s to London in many re&s;pects, &s;hould not be better furni&s;hed with conveniences for &s;trangers, or have a public lodging-hou&s;e where you can find toler|able entertainment. But it really has not; and I am the more &s;urpri&s;ed at it, as, in their manner of living, and ma|ny cu&s;toms, I think the inhabitants much re&s;emble the French. But in this particular, what a difference be|tween this place and Paris! where in a minute you may be provided with a hou&s;e equal to one of the greate&s;t nobility, with &s;ervants, equipage, and all the luxuries of elegance and ta&s;te; whil&s;t at Edinburgh, without an inn to put your head into, and without a lodging that you can breath in, you are obliged to ble&s;s your &s;tars to get any place to repo&s;e your&s;elf, till better

<HEAD>SECT. LXXII. OF THE HOSPITALITY AND GOOD-BREEDING OF THE SCOTCH; THEIR LANGUAGE, PARTICULAR BEAUTIES OF IT, AND EXPRESSIONS.</HEAD>
<P>THIS country has long been celebrated for its ho&s;|pitality to &s;trangers; and I am &s;ure I can with great truth add my humble &s;uffrage to this general ob&s;erva|tion. They do not think they have paid you all the attention that is nece&s;&s;ary, when they have invited you once to dinner, and then take no more notice of you. They are eager to &s;how you repeated civilities. They
<PB N="110" REF="031692_0433_0FEE213D422F8E18">
are happy to explain, to inform you of what is really curious in their country. They give you a general in|vitation to their hou&s;es. They beg of you to vi&s;it them familiarly, and are &s;orry if you do not do &s;o. I am a&s;hamed to &s;ay that many of my countrymen &s;eem to have forgot all their kindne&s;s the moment they return|ed over the Tweed. I tru&s;t tho&s;e waters will never wa&s;h away my remembrance, but that I &s;hall always be proud to own the ho&s;pitality of the Scotch, and the civilities I received in Scotland.</P>
<P>I know of no quality more con&s;picuous in the in|habitants of this country, than complai&s;ance; which is common to every age and &s;ex, but more particularly to the women, who &s;eem to make it a &s;tudy to oblige, and endeavour to emulate each other in good breed|ing; which, I think, is the art of &s;howing people, by external &s;igns, the inward regard which we have for them. As nothing indicates the judgment of a nation more than good breeding, &s;o it likewi&s;e di&s;covers their good nature. For politene&s;s is, in my opinion, the re|&s;ult not only of good nature, but of good &s;en&s;e. It gives a lu&s;tre to every other charm, and conceals, in a great degree, every di&s;advantage which women may lie under in their per&s;ons. But I a&s;&s;ure you, the Scotch ladies have no need of this enchanting accompli&s;hment on the la&s;t account. Nature has been as liberal to them in decorating their external parts, as in orna|menting
<PB N="111" REF="031692_0434_0FEE213EC9983CE0">
their minds; and I believe as few nations ex|cel them in beauty, as in advantages derived from di&s;|po&s;ition and education. No women under&s;tand better the rules of decorum, nor are they rivalled by the French in the talent of agreeable conver&s;ation; for which they &s;eem to be better calculated, as well from their &s;uperi|or knowledge of the world, as from their more exten|&s;ive acquaintance with books and literature.</P>
<P>When you are told, that on the fir&s;t introduction to a lady in this country, you are favoured with a &s;alute, which immediately di&s;covers the fragrance of her breath, the downy velvet of her &s;kin, and pearly enamel of her teeth; that the fir&s;t words &s;he utters to you is either <HI>My good friend,</HI> or <HI>My dear &s;ir,</HI> which &s;oftened by the &s;weetne&s;s of her voice, and affability of her manner, mu&s;t receive an additional degree of warmth and kind|ne&s;s; can you wonder that I am &s;o enamoured with their company? or rather, do you not wonder that I can think of leaving them? But alas! alas! the time approaches for my departure; and if it was not for one dear object, who attracts me, like the faithful &s;teel, to the magic circle of her arms, it would be with the ut|mo&s;t regret I &s;hould bid farewell to a country, which is the land of plea&s;ure, rapture, and delight.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e you &s;hould &s;ay, that the&s;e words, though very plea&s;ing at fir&s;t on account of their novelty, mu&s;t &s;oon lo&s;e their charm, when we come to be acquaint|ed
<PB N="112" REF="031692_0435_0FEE214225880840">
that they are mere words of cu&s;tom, and ceremony, and uttered without any intention of good-will or &s;in|cerity; and that expre&s;&s;ions of kindne&s;s, when they are not known to be the marks and effects of kindne&s;s, are empty &s;ounds; I mu&s;t grant, that by degrees they become habitual, and do not operate &s;o &s;trongly by u&s;e, as on a &s;tranger. But &s;urely, at any time they are the highe&s;t &s;igns of complai&s;ance; and giving the appearance of truth to actions, and a &s;trong de&s;ire to plea&s;e and oblige, certainly produce a partiality for the &s;peaker: not by the words, which in common &s;peech &s;ignify &s;carce any thing; but becau&s;e by the&s;e words he &s;hows that he thinks you worth notice. Ex|pre&s;&s;ions of this nature are ingenious flattery. It makes tho&s;e, to whom it is paid, flatter them&s;elves, whil&s;t they look on it as a declaration of merit in them&s;elves: and pray, what mortal man does not love to be flattered by a lady; For my own part, if it is a fault, I mu&s;t plead guilty; and though I dete&s;t it as much as hypocri&s;y in the male part of our &s;pecies, I am not proof again&s;t it when a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the fire of &s;parkling eyes, and deliv|ered by female eloquence. A &s;taunch philo&s;opher would derive this credulity from the orig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nal perver&s;e|ne&s;s of human nature; and in the &s;ame manner as Ad|am &s;wallowed the forbidden fruit, though he knew it contained none of tho&s;e excellent qualities a&s;cribed to it by Eve; &s;o we, his progeny, are tempted by the
<PB N="113" REF="031692_0436_0FEE214585BD3530">
flattery of the fair &s;ex, and &s;ure to give it credit, not|with&s;tanding we are con&s;cious of its untruth and in&s;in|cerity.</P>
<P>The Scotch language has one beauty, in which it greatly excels the Engli&s;h, and in which al&s;o it con|forms to the Italian; that of diminutives, which are created at plea&s;ure, and expre&s;&s;ed in one word, by the addition of a letter or &s;yllable. Thus, they &s;ay, "man|ny, doggy, catty," for a little man, dog, or cat: "wifey" for a little wife; and if it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;peak of an inanimate thing, they do it in the &s;ame manner; as "a buckley, knifey, booky, hou&s;ey," for a little buc|kle, knife, book, and a hou&s;e. I need not tell you how emphatical this makes their tongue, and what an im|provement it is on ours. But their pronunciation and accent is far from being agreeable. It gives an air of gravity, &s;edatene&s;s, and importance to their words; which though of u&s;e &s;ometimes in an harrangue or public di&s;cour&s;e, in common conver&s;ation &s;eems dull, heavy, &s;tupid, and unharmonious. On which account I &s;carcely ever heard a Scotchman tell a good &s;tory in all my life: for notwith&s;tanding he might put in all the circum&s;tances to work it to a point, he would be &s;ure to &s;poil it by his deficiency in manner, and re|move the &s;ting, which ought to tickle the imagination of the hearer, by appearing not to feel it him&s;elf. The inhabitants of this place, who are acquainted with the
<PB N="114" REF="031692_0437_0FEE214AB13601D8">
Engli&s;h, are &s;en&s;ible of this, and endeavour to &s;peak like them, e&s;pecially the politer &s;ort of people, and the Profe&s;&s;ors of the College, who, in their lectures, &s;trive to &s;hake off the Scotch pronunciation as much as po&s;|&s;ible. The literary productions of this country being well known, it is unnece&s;&s;ary for me to make any ob|&s;ervations on their &s;tyle. I &s;hall only &s;ay, that they appear to me, from their conver&s;ation, to write En|gli&s;h as a foreign tongue; their mode of talking, phra&s;e, and expre&s;&s;ion, but little re&s;embling the language of their works; though I cannot but add, that even &s;ome of them, in their conver&s;ation are fond of &s;howing their learning, by making u&s;e of words derived from an|cient languages. Amenity is a favourite word of a celebrated hi&s;torian, who is truly the boa&s;t of his coun|try; who, in private reputation has as few equals, as in public, &s;uperiors; and who&s;e works may be ju&s;tly &s;aid to be "non ludicra cantilena ad momentum tem|poris, &s;ed monumentum ad aeternitatem."</P>

<HEAD>SECT. LXXIII. OF THE SUPPERS OF THE SCOTCH, AND THEIR MANNER OF CONDUCTING THEM.</HEAD>
<P>A MAN who vi&s;its this country, after having been in France, will find, in a thou&s;and in&s;tances, the re|&s;emblance,
<PB N="115" REF="031692_0438_0FEE214C3AE9C598">
which there is betwixt the&s;e two nations. That air of mirth and vivacity, that quick and penetrating look, that &s;pirit of gaiety which di&s;tingui&s;h|es the French, is equally vi&s;ible in the Scotch. It is the character of the nation; and it is a very happy one, as it makes them di&s;regard even their poverty. Where there is any material difference, I believe, it may be attributed to the difference of their religion; for that &s;ame catholic religion, to &s;ay the truth of it, is a mo&s;t comfortable one. The article of ab&s;olution is certainly a ble&s;&s;ed invention, and renders the &s;pirits free and unclouded, by placing all the burthen of our &s;ins upon another man's back. A poor Engli&s;hman goes fretting and groaning, and carrying his mi&s;erable face into all companies, as contagious as an epidemic|al di&s;order, without one &s;oul to take compa&s;&s;ion on him, or pity his weakne&s;s: and &s;hould he not have a wife or family at home who cannot avoid him, he finds no per&s;on who will bear his infirmities, or look as &s;ad as he does; but is con&s;trained to wander about an un|&s;ociable being, till the month of November, and the <HI>maladie Angloi&s;e</HI> relieve him from his di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>But though the Scotch have no ab&s;olution, they have &s;omething very like it&mdash;a &s;uper&s;titious reliance on the efficacy of going con&s;tantly to church. Many of them may be &s;aid to pa&s;s half their lives there; for they go almo&s;t without cea&s;ing, and look as &s;orrowful
<PB N="116" REF="031692_0439_0FEE214F9A4762F0">
at the time as if they were going, not only to bury their &s;ins, but them&s;elves. At other hours, they are as cheerful and as gay as po&s;&s;ible; and probably, from hence ari&s;es that ea&s;e, that &s;pirit in their conver&s;ation, which charms in every company, and which is the life of every &s;ociety. They &s;ee no harm in innocent fa|miliarity. They think a frank and unre&s;trained beha|viour the be&s;t &s;ign of a good heart; and agree with Lord Shafte&s;bury, "that gravity is the very e&s;&s;ence of impo&s;ture."</P>
<P>Whenever the Scotch of both Sexes meet, they do not appear as if they had never &s;een each other before, or wi&s;hed never to &s;ee each other again. They do not &s;it in &s;ullen &s;ilence, looking on the ground, biting their nails, and at a lo&s;s what to do with them&s;elves; and if &s;ome one &s;hould be hardy enough to break &s;ilence, &s;tart, as if they were &s;hot through the ear with a pi&s;|tol. But they addre&s;s each other at fir&s;t &s;ight, and with an <HI>impre&s;&s;ement</HI> that is highly plea&s;ing. They appear to be &s;atisfied with one another, or at lea&s;t, if they re|ally are not &s;o, they have the prudence to conceal their di&s;like. To &s;ee them in perfection, is to &s;ee them at their entertainments.</P>
<P>When dinners are given here, they are invitations of form. The entertainment of plea&s;ure is their &s;up|pers, which re&s;emble the petit &s;oupers of France. Of the&s;e they are very fond; and it is a mark of their
<PB N="117" REF="031692_0440_0FEE2152F66CB570">
friend&s;hip to be admitted to be of the party. It is in the&s;e meetings that the plea&s;ures of &s;ociety and conver|&s;ation reign, when the re&s;traints of ceremony are ban|i&s;hed, and you &s;ee people really as they are: and I mu&s;t &s;ay, in honour of the Scotch, that I never met with a more agreeable people, with more plea&s;ing or more in&s;inuating manners, in my life. The&s;e little parties generally con&s;i&s;t of about &s;even or eight per&s;ons, which prevents the conver&s;ation from being particular, and which it always mu&s;t be in larger companies.</P>
<P>During the &s;upper, which continues &s;ome time, the Scotch ladies drink more wine than an Engli&s;h wo|man could well bear; but the climate requires it and probably in &s;ome mea&s;ure it may enliven their natural vivacity. Without quoting foreign authorities, you will allow that a certain degree of wine adds great life to conver&s;ation. An Engli&s;hman, we know, is &s;ome|times e&s;teemed the be&s;t companion in the world after the &s;econd bottle; and who, before that, would not have opened his lips for the univer&s;e. After &s;upper is removed, and they are tired of conver&s;ing, they vary the &s;cene by &s;inging, in which many of the Scotch ex|cel. There is a plaintive &s;implicity in the generality of their &s;ongs, to which the words are extremely well adapted, and which, from the mouth of a pretty Scotch girl, inconceivably attracting. You frequently feel the force of tho&s;e very expre&s;&s;ions, that at another time you

The eye, the whole counte|nance, &s;peak frequently as much as the voice; for I have &s;ometimes found that I had a very ju&s;t idea of the tenor of a &s;ong, though I did not comprehend three words in the whole. Formerly it was the cu&s;tom for the bagpipe to play during their entertainments, and every family had their bard. In the&s;e &s;ongs were re|hear&s;ed the martial and heroic deeds of their ance&s;tors, as incentives to their own courage; but in the&s;e pip|ing times of peace, "our &s;tern alarms are changed to merry meetings," and tales of love and gentlene&s;s have &s;ucceeded to tho&s;e of war. In&s;tead of the drow&s;y hum of a bagpipe, which would certainly have laid my noble courage a&s;leep, the voice of &s;ome pretty girl claims your attention, which in my opinion, is no bad change. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I have not much opinion of tho&s;e fea&s;ts "of other times," where your ears were continually &s;tunned with the murders &s;uch a man had committed, and where he was continually told of what he had already done, that he might perform the &s;ame again.

<P>I FIND the vulgar inhabitants of this country as va|rying in their di&s;po&s;ition from tho&s;e of the &s;outhern parts of Great Britain, as the AEthiopians from the na|tives of Mexico, and as unlike, as if they were Anti|podes. Though Scotland and England together are very minute in compari&s;on with any of the countries on the European Continent, yet you cannot conceive a

<P>In&s;tead of that &s;tubborn rudene&s;s, and uncouth mind, that &s;hyne&s;s and barbari&s;m, which is even culti|vated by our pea&s;ants, you find in the lowe&s;t kind in Scotland a compliant ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s and &s;oftne&s;s of temper, an ambition to oblige, and a &s;ociability which charms you. They are naturally, grave, ho&s;pitable, and friendly; and have &s;uch a peculiar attachment to their own country and families, that, were I to relate to you the wonderful accounts which I have li&s;tened to with a&s;toni&s;hment, you could not but think that I was bordering on romance.</P>
<P>But what di&s;tingui&s;hes them from the vulgar inhabi|tants of almo&s;t any nation, is that peculiar de&s;ire to o|blige and in&s;truct, a philanthropy which they di&s;cov|er, on all occa&s;ions, to be of &s;ervice and to do good, and which never can fail of rendering their intercour&s;e and conver&s;ation mo&s;t agreeable, and of the greate&s;t utility to the traveller.</P>
<P>In a wild and uncultivated country, in a mi&s;erable hovel, de&s;titute of every convenience of life, expo&s;ed to all the inclemencies of climate, without common nece&s;&s;aries to drag on a wretched, uncomfortable be|ing, it is here you meet with &s;ouls, generous, contented,
<PB N="121" REF="031692_0444_0FEE2162683E2790">
and happy, ever ready to the call of humanity, religious and charitable.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort tour that I lately made to the highlands, an opportunity pre&s;ented it&s;elf of making my ob&s;erva|tions on the minds of this people; &s;ince I mixed with them, conver&s;ed on variety of &s;ubjects, lived in their families, and pa&s;&s;ed with them many a happy hour. As I frequently wandered over the mountains with my gun, I often found a &s;eque&s;tered village, which had lit|tle communication with the re&s;t of mankind, that had received &s;carce any form or fa&s;hion from art and human invention; and, con&s;equently, not far remote from its ori|ginal &s;implicity. One day a &s;torm drove me to &s;eek &s;hel|ter in a &s;mall cottage, which I by chance e&s;pied in a deep valley at the foot of one of their mountains; and on entering, I &s;aw a venerable old woman, with another about thirty, and five or &s;ix pretty infants, which, by their re&s;emblance, I ea&s;ily di&s;covered to be her children, all employed in &s;ome dome&s;tic concer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, and waiting the return of the ma&s;ter of the family, who, I afterwards found, was gone to provide fi&s;h and other nece&s;&s;aries, from a &s;mall town on the banks of the neighbouring lake. When they perceived me at the door, the moth|er of the little ones came immediately to meet me, and, with a countenance full of benevolence and ho&s;pitality, &s;aluted me in the Ear&s;e language; which, though I did not under&s;tand it, &s;eemed to welcome to whatever
<PB N="122" REF="031692_0445_0FEE2163EFA2BF78">
they could afford, or I could expect to find there. She then reached me a &s;tool, which was made of ru&s;hes, &s;eeing I did not comprehend her tongue, and was pointing to me to &s;it down by the fire, when I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to the old lady in the corner, and de|manded whether &s;he could &s;peak Engli&s;h; but they all &s;hook their heads and were &s;ilent. I then unloaded my game-bag, which contained a white hare, and &s;ome ptarmigan, and began to court their good opinion, by pre&s;enting them to the children, and endeavouring to divert them, by &s;howing them my &s;hooting implements and other things which I had in my pocket, and which &s;eemed to give them much delight: the woman in the mean time, making &s;igns to me to pull off my wet clothes, and holding out a plaid which they had warm|ed by the fire. On my &s;eeming to refu&s;e their kind offices, they &s;hook them&s;elves and looked &s;orrowful, which meant as I &s;ince learned, if I did not change my dre&s;s, I &s;hould catch an ague: a di&s;order to which they were extremely &s;ubject.</P>
<P>As the weather continued to threaten, and night was not far off, I &s;at my&s;elf down by the hearth and a|mu&s;ed my&s;elf by pulling off the feathers of one of the birds, which I made them comprehend would be very acceptable, as I had eat nothing almo&s;t the whole day; and ju&s;t as I was preparing to broil it, the highlander opened the door, and, expre&s;&s;ing his &s;urpri&s;e at finding
<PB N="123" REF="031692_0446_0FEE216576371EB0">
a &s;tranger had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his hou&s;hold goods, in a free and good-natured tone of voice, in the Scotch language, begged of me to proceed in my employ, and enquired the rea&s;on of this vi&s;it; adding, with a &s;mile, "that I mu&s;t have entertained his wife and mother ex|tremely well during his ab&s;ence, to become &s;o familiar with them; e&s;pecially as they did not under&s;tand me, and had never in their lives beheld the face of any hu|man per&s;on, except a few of their own Clan, who in|habited the other &s;ide of the hill."</P>
<P>When I had told him my &s;tory, and intreated par|don for the freedom I had taken, he embraced me with the highe&s;t degree of rapture, and ordering the others to do the &s;ame, told me, "the gentleman with whom I had been, and to who&s;e hou&s;e I wi&s;hed to return the next day, was the head of his Clan; that he re&s;pected him, and would die for him; and &s;ince I was a vi&s;itor to the Laird, I claimed from him every kind of ho&s;pital|ity and convenience, which his poor pittance could &s;upply; though he added, as a &s;tranger, who had lo&s;t my way, I had a right to civility and a&s;&s;i&s;tance from every man."</P>
<P>When I had fini&s;hed my ptarmigan, of which they would none of them partake, he produced on the ta|ble &s;ome dried fi&s;h, chee&s;e, and oat-cake, of which they all eat with an appetite that di&s;covered their pov|erty, and that brought to my remembrance the &s;aying
<PB N="124" REF="031692_0447_0FEE216C9EBD4EF8">
of the philo&s;opher, that "He that eats with an empty &s;tomach needs no variety of food; he that drinks only for thir&s;t de&s;ires lea&s;t change of liquor; and he that wants lea&s;t, comes neare&s;t to the gods." On our being &s;atisfied, he gave &s;ome to the infants, and &s;aid a grace in the pre&s;byterian form, prai&s;ing God with more fervent devotion than ever I met with in an Engli&s;h bi&s;hop at the admini&s;tration of the &s;acrament.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the night we &s;pent in conver&s;ation, whil&s;t they plied me heartily with whi&s;key; and I an&s;wered a number of que&s;tions which were demanded of me by the women, thro' him as interpreter; till at length, o|ver-powered by fatigue, I repo&s;ed my&s;elf in a plaid by the fire, and enjoyed as &s;ound a &s;lumber, as if my head had been pillowed on down,
<Q><L>Under a canopy of co&s;tly &s;tate.</L></Q></P>
<P>The morning aro&s;e, and I took farewell of my kind ho&s;te&s;&s;es, who parted with me, with many expre&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip; and, if I may judge from their counte|nance, wi&s;hed that the &s;tormy weather had continu|ed, that I might have been detained longer. The highlander accompanied me acro&s;s the mountains in my progre&s;s homeward, cheating the drearine&s;s of the way by his entertaining di&s;cour&s;e, concerning the an|tiquity of his family, and the ance&s;tors of his Laird, whom he had followed in the rebellion, and under

who&s;e banners he had ventured his life and fortune. We had now arrived within &s;ight of the hou&s;e of my friend, when he wi&s;hed me health and &s;ucce&s;s through life, and that I might never go further out of my right way than when I wandered to his habitation. I paid this kindne&s;s with all the coin I was then ma&s;ter of, and parted with a thou&s;and thanks and gratitude for his civilities.</P>
<P>I have detained you all this while with this length of &s;tory, in order to paint to you the true character of a Scotch pea&s;ant; and I dare &s;ay you will be a&s;toni&s;h|ed to find &s;o many virtues in a family in the High|lands, where the inhabitants are thought by us to be in a &s;tate of barbari&s;m.

<HEAD>SECT. LXXV. OF THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE DIVERSIONS OF THE INHABITANTS OF EDINBURGH; AND MANNER OF EDUCATING THE YOUNG LADIES.</HEAD>
<P>THEY have at Edinburgh an elegant play-hou&s;e, and tolerable performers: a&s;&s;emblies, concerts, pub|lic gardens, and walks, card parties, and a hundred o|ther diver&s;ions, which in &s;ome degree keep me from pining for your Fe&s;tino, Bach's concert, or Almack's.</P>
<P>As the genius of any people is not more ea&s;ily di&s;|covered in their &s;erious moments, than when they give a loo&s;e to freedom and plea&s;ure; &s;o the Scotch nation is peculiarly characterized by the mode of their diver|&s;ions. A &s;ober &s;edate elegance pervades them all,
<PB N="127" REF="031692_0450_0FEE217A253131C8">
blended with an ea&s;e and propriety which delights, and is &s;ure to meet with approbation. A Scotchman does not relax him&s;elf for amu&s;ements, as if to pa&s;s away the hour. He &s;eems even in the heighth of plea&s;ure, bu&s;y and intent, and as he would do, were he about to gain &s;ome advantage. His diver&s;ions are not calculated to &s;educe the unwary, or recreate the idle, but to unbend the mind, without corrupting it. He &s;eems as if in his infancy he had been taught to make learning his diver|&s;ion, and was now rever&s;ing it, and making his diver|&s;ion his &s;tudy.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides the public entertainments of this city, which are derived from company, the inhabitants have more re&s;ources of plea&s;ure within them&s;elves than in many other places. The young people paint, draw, are fond of mu&s;ic, or employ their hours in reading, and acquiring the accompli&s;hments of the mind. Every boarding-&s;chool Mi&s;s has &s;omething of this kind to recommend her, and make her an agreeable compan|ion; and in&s;tead of a little &s;mattering of French, which is the highe&s;t ambition to attain in Queen's Square, you find them in Edinburgh entertaining in conver&s;ation, &s;entimental, and well-informed. The mode of educa|tion of the young ladies, is here highly to be com|mended, and admirably calculated to make them good wives. Be&s;ides needle-work, and tho&s;e trifling arts, which are the principal part of their in&s;truction in En|gland,
<PB N="128" REF="031692_0451_0FEE217BABBE68F8">
the precepts of morality, virtue, and honour, are taught them from their earlie&s;t infancy, whil&s;t they are in&s;tructed to con&s;ider them&s;elves as beings born for &s;ociety, for more than out&s;ide appearance, and tran&s;itory plea&s;ure, and to attend to the knowledge of what is u&s;eful, rather than the oeconomy of a tambour|frame.</P>
<P>The ladies al&s;o who undertake this arduous ta&s;k of in&s;truction, are per&s;ons much better qualified in gene|ral than in other countries. They likewi&s;e introduce them into the polite&s;t company, and give them a ta&s;te for elegant and proper amu&s;ements; &s;o that when they leave &s;chool, they are not only mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of tho&s;e ac|compli&s;hments which are nece&s;&s;ary to command a fa|mily, but have the deportment and behaviour of expe|rienced women of fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>No ladies in Scotland ever murder the precious mo|ments in what is called "work," which is neither en|tertainment nor profit, merely becau&s;e they mu&s;t have the appearance of doing &s;omething, whil&s;t they &s;ee ev|ery one employed around them. They let no minute e&s;cape without its re&s;pective office, which may be of utility to them&s;elves or others; and after a proper &s;acri|fice to reading and literature, gain in&s;truction from &s;o|ciety and conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>I have often thought it a principal defect in the ed|ucation
<PB N="129" REF="031692_0452_0FEE217D340B8C20">
of the Engli&s;h ladies, that they are taught to pay &s;o much attention to the practice of &s;ewing work, and other needle operations, whil&s;t they neglect learn|ing of greater importance and plea&s;ure. Since they have minds equally capable of in&s;truction with the o|ther &s;ex, why &s;hould they not be enlightened with the &s;ame kind of knowledge? e&s;pecially as they &s;eem more &s;uited to it, as well from their &s;uperior &s;en&s;ibility, as their greater lei&s;ure and dome&s;tic life. Why &s;hould the charactere&s;tic which di&s;tingui&s;hes us from brutes, be &s;o &s;trongly cultivated in the male, and have &s;o little attention paid to it in the female &s;pecies? Wi&s;dom and &s;cience are not perfections in us merely becau&s;e we are men; but as rea&s;onable creatures, who have the pre-eminence over the re&s;t of the creation. It is in|deed nece&s;&s;ary for the ladies to know the&s;e things, in order to qualify them for dome&s;tic oeconomy; but I have no idea of any woman, except her who&s;e circum|&s;tances cannot afford the expence of paying a &s;er|vant, making them her employ, or putting them in practice.</P>
<P>The married ladies of this city &s;eldom entertain large &s;ets of company, or have routs as in London. They give the preference to private parties, and <HI>conver&s;aziones,</HI> where they play at cards for &s;mall &s;ums, and never run the ri&s;k of being obliged to di&s;charge a debt of honour at the expence of their virtue and innocence. They
<PB N="130" REF="031692_0453_0FEE2184491881A8">
often frequent the theatre, and &s;how great ta&s;te and judgment in the choice of plays, where Mr. Digges performs a principal character.</P>
<P>As to exerci&s;e, they &s;eldom ride on hor&s;eback; but find much plea&s;ure in walking, to which the &s;oil and country is peculiarly adapted, being dry, plea&s;ant, and abounding in pro&s;pects and romantic &s;cenes. It is likewi&s;e cu&s;tomary for them to drive in their carriages to the &s;ands at Leith and Mu&s;&s;elburgh, and parade backwards and forwards, after the manner of Scarbo|rough; and other public places of &s;ea-bathing re&s;ort. For vivacity and agility in dancing, none excel the Scotch ladies. Their execution in reels and coun|try-dances is amazing; and the variety of &s;teps which they introduce, and the ju&s;tne&s;s of their ear is beyond de&s;cription. They are very fond al&s;o of minuets, but fall greatly &s;hort in the performance of them, as they are deficient in grace and elegance in their motions. Ma|ny of them play on the harp&s;icord and guitar, and &s;ome have mu&s;ic in their voices, though they rather love to hear others perform than play them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I do not think the Scotch ladies are great proficient in the languages. They rarely attempt any thing fur|ther than the French; which, indeed, they &s;peak with great propriety, fluency, and good accent; but they make up for it by their accurate and ju&s;t knowledge
<PB N="131" REF="031692_0454_0FEE2185D0A087E0">
of their own. They talk very grammatically, are pe|culiarly attentive to the conformity of their words to their ideas, and are great critics in the Engli&s;h tongue. They chiefly read hi&s;tory and plaintive poetry; but elegies and pa&s;torals are their favourites. Novels and romances they feel and admire; and tho&s;e chiefly which are tender, &s;ympathetic, &s;oothing, or melan|choly.&mdash;Their hearts are &s;oft, and full of pa&s;&s;ion, and a well told &s;tory makes a deep impre&s;&s;ion on them. Like virgin wax, a gentle heat mollifies their minds, which reflects the fine&s;t touches of art and &s;entiment.</P>
<P>Nor are the gentleman in Edinburgh le&s;s rational in their diver&s;ions than the ladies. There is only one in which I can cen&s;ure their conduct. They rather pay too much re&s;pect to the divinity of Bacchus, and offer too copious libations at the &s;hrine of that jovial deity. Their wines, indeed, of all kinds are excellent, and their climate not the mo&s;t comfortable; &s;o that &s;ome allowance ought to be made them in that re&s;pect. But as they are, they are by no means &s;o intemperate as the Germans; and, perhaps, their appearing to me in the lea&s;t intemperate, may be occa&s;ioned by my peculiar aver&s;ion to, and ab&s;tinence from all intoxica|ting liquors. I have neither ta&s;te to reli&s;h, nor head to bear them. I have no idea of a man extending the plea&s;ure of drinking beyond thir&s;t, or forcing, in ima|gination, an appetite artificial, and again&s;t nature.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="031692_0455_0FEE218758157760">
The youths in this country are very manly in their exerci&s;es and amu&s;ements. Strength and agility &s;eem to be mo&s;t their attention. The in&s;ignificant pa&s;times of marbles, tops, &amp;c. they are totally unacquainted with. The diver&s;ion which is peculiar to Scotland, and in which all ages find great plea&s;ure, is golf. They play at it with a &s;mall leathern ball, like a fives ball, and a piece of wood, flat on one &s;ide, in the &s;hape of a &s;mall bat, which is fa&s;tened at the end of a &s;tick, of three or four feet long, at right angles to it. The art con&s;i&s;ts in &s;triking the ball with this in&s;trument, into a hole in the ground, in a &s;maller number of &s;trokes than your adver&s;ary. This game has the &s;uperiority of cricket, and tennis, in being le&s;s violent and danger|ous; but in point of dexterity and amu&s;ement, by no means to be compared with them. However, I am informed that &s;ome &s;kill and nicety are nece&s;&s;ary to &s;trike the ball to the propo&s;ed di&s;tance and no further, and that in this there is a con&s;iderable difference in players. It requires no great exertion and &s;trength, and all ranks and ages play at it. They in&s;truct their children in it, as &s;oon as they can run alone, and grey hairs boa&s;t their execution. As to their other diver|&s;ions, they dance, play at cards, love &s;hooting, hunting, the plea&s;ures of the field; but are proficients in none of them. When they are young, indeed, they dance, in the manner of their country, extremely well; but afterwards (to &s;peak in the language of the turf) they train off, and are too robu&s;t and mu&s;cular to po&s;&s;e&s;s ei|ther grace or agility.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. LXXVI. OF THE HAGUE AND ROTTERDAM.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING can be more agreeable than travelling in Holland. The whole country appears a large gar|den; the roads are well paved, &s;haded on each &s;ide with rows of trees, and bordered with large canals, full of boats pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing. Every twenty paces gives you the pro&s;pect of &s;ome villa, and every four hours that of a large town, &s;o &s;urpri&s;ingly neat, I am &s;ure you would be charmed with them. The Hague is certainly one of the fine&s;t villages in the world. Here are &s;everal &s;quares finely built, and (what I think a par|ticular beauty) the whole &s;et with thick large trees. The <HI>Voor-hout</HI> is, at the &s;ame time, the Hyde-Park and Mall of the people of quality: for they take the air in it both on foot and in coaches.</P>
<P>The appearance of Rotterdam gives one very great plea&s;ure. All the &s;treets are paved with broad &s;tones, and before many of the meane&s;t artificers doors are placed &s;eats of various coloured marbles, &s;o neatly kept, that I a&s;&s;ure you I walked almo&s;t over the town ye&s;terday, <HI>incognito,</HI> in my &s;lippers, without receiving one &s;pot of dirt; and you may &s;ee the Dutch maids wa&s;hing the pavement of the &s;treets with more application than ours do our bed chambers.</P>

The town &s;eems &s;o full of people, with &s;uch bu&s;y faces, all in motion, that I can hardly fancy it is not &s;ome celebrated fair; but I &s;ee it is every day the &s;ame. It is certain no town can be more advantageou&s;ly &s;itu|ated for commerce. Here are &s;even large canals, on which the merchants &s;hips come up to the very doors of their hou&s;es. The &s;hops and wharehou&s;es are of a &s;urprizing neatne&s;s and magnificence, filled with an incredible quantity of fine merchandize, and &s;o much cheaper than what we &s;ee in England, that I have much ado to per&s;uade my&s;elf I am &s;till &s;o near it. Here is neither dirt nor beggary to be &s;een. One is not &s;hock|ed with tho&s;e loath&s;ome cripples &s;o common in Lon|don, nor teazed with the importunity of idle per&s;ons that chu&s;e to be na&s;ty and lazy. The common &s;er|vants and little &s;hop-women here are more nicely clean than &s;ome of our Ladies; and the great variety of neat dre&s;&s;es (every woman dre&s;&s;ing her head after her own fa&s;hion) is an additional plea&s;ure in &s;eeing the town.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. LXXVII. ANOTHER ACCOUNT OF ROTTERDAM AND THE HAGUE. A. D. 1784.</HEAD>
<P>ROTTERDAM lies on the north &s;ide of the Mae&s;e, about fifteen miles from the &s;ea, is of a triangular form, and, in point of trade, inferior only to Am&s;terdam; in
<PB N="135" REF="031692_0458_0FEE21918BEC0C38">
the &s;paciou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;treets, and elegance of the hou&s;|es, infinitely beyond it. The canals are &s;o large as to admit &s;hips of two or three hundred tons, even to the very doors of the merchants; and I know not &s;o ro|mantic a &s;ight, as to &s;ee from the environs, the chim|nies, ma&s;ts of &s;hips, and the tops of trees, &s;o promi&s;|cuou&s;ly huddled together, that it would acquire a de|gree of divination to tell whether it is a town, a fleet, or a fore&s;t.</P>
<P>The grande&s;t, as well as mo&s;t agreeable &s;treet in Rot|terdam, is the Bomb Quay, which lies parallel with the Mae&s;e. On one &s;ide it is open to the river, and the other is ornamented with a grand facade of the be&s;t hou&s;es in the city, inhabited chiefly by the Engli&s;h. They are five or &s;ix &s;tories high, ma&s;&s;y, and very clum|&s;y. Wherever there is any attempt at ornament, it is the wor&s;t that can be conceived. One &s;ees no Gre|cian architecture, except Doric entablatures, &s;tuck up|on the top of the upper &s;tory, without pila&s;ters; Ionic volutes, turned often the wrong way, and an attempt at Corinthian capitals, without any other part of the or|der. The doors are large, and &s;tuck with great knobs and clum&s;y carving. You a&s;cend to them, not in front, but by three or four &s;teps going up on each &s;ide, and you are a&s;&s;i&s;ted by iron rails of a mo&s;t immen&s;e thick|ne&s;s. The&s;e hou&s;es are almo&s;t all window, and the window &s;hutters and frames being painted green, the
<PB N="136" REF="031692_0459_0FEE2198A7DCBA28">
gla&s;s has all a green ca&s;t, which is helped by the re|flection from the trees that over-&s;hadow their hou&s;es, which, were it not for this circum&s;tance, would be in|tolerably hot, from their vicinity to the canals. Mo&s;t of the hou&s;es have looking-gla&s;&s;es placed on the out&s;ides, of the windows, on both &s;ides, in order that they may &s;ee every thing which pa&s;&s;es up and down the &s;treet. The &s;tair-ca&s;es are narrow, &s;teep, and come down al|mo&s;t to the door. The Bomb Quay is &s;o broad, that there are di&s;tinct walks for carriages and foot pa&s;&s;en|gers, lined and &s;haded with a double row of trees. You look over the river on &s;ome beautiful meadows, and a fine avenue of trees, which leads to the Pe&s;t-hou&s;e. It &s;eems to be an elegant building, and the trees round it are &s;o di&s;po&s;ed as to appear a thick wood.</P>
<P>This &s;treet is at lea&s;t half a mile in length, and ex|tends from the Old to the New Head, the two places where the water enters to fill the canals of this exten&s;ive city. I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that when water runs through a &s;treet, it then a&s;&s;umes the name of a canal, of which kind the Heerenfleet has the pre-eminence. The hou&s;|es are of free-&s;tone, and very lofty; the canal is &s;pa|cious, and covered with &s;hips. At one end &s;tands the Engli&s;h church, a neat pretty building, of which the bi&s;hop of London is Ordinary.</P>
<P>Upon the Great Bridge, in the Grand Market-place, is the &s;tatue of that wonderful man Era<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">us. It is
<PB N="137" REF="031692_0460_0FEE219A2E6A04E0">
bigger than the life, in bra&s;s, and clad in a Doctor's gown. He was born in 1467, and died at Friburg in Al&s;ace, in the year 1536.</P>
<P>Near to the market place is the great church of St. Laurence. From the tower I had as exten&s;ive a view as my eye could command, there being neither hill nor wood to interrupt my &s;ight. I &s;aw Delft and the Hague to the north; Dort, to the &s;outh; Brill, to the we&s;t; Am&s;terdam, to the ea&s;t, and Utrecht lies off to the &s;outh-ea&s;t.</P>
<P>There are four churches in Rotterdam of the e&s;tab|li&s;hed religion, which is Calvini&s;m, and twelve clergy|men to attend them, who&s;e &s;tipends are one hundred and &s;eventy pounds per au<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">um each, which is paid out of the revenues of the city. St. Laurence is like all o|ther Dutch churches, dive&s;ted of ornament; gloomy and dark, by rea&s;on of the numberle&s;s atchievements; which are hung every where round the walls, and which are in general of black velvet, with the arms blazon|ed, encompa&s;&s;ed in a heavy black frame.</P>
<P>I look on the exchange, which was fini&s;hed in 1736, to be the fine&s;t building in Rotterdam. It is a quad|rangle of free-&s;tone, with a light cloi&s;ter. It is much neater, though not &s;o large as our Royal Exchange. There is, however, no merit in the architecture.</P>
<P>We la&s;t night hired a coach, which is fixed at a guil|der an hour, to take us to Delfts-Hagen, a little village
<PB N="138" REF="031692_0461_0FEE219BB53BD690">
about half an hour's di&s;tance. The road was very plea&s;ant, being planted on each &s;ide with trees. There was nothing &s;ufficiently curious in the place it&s;elf to drag us from Rotterdam; but it being a public fair, we wi&s;hed to &s;ee the humours of a Dutch Wake. Chil|dren's toys and womens &s;lippers &s;eemed to make the chief figure, there being little el&s;e to be fold.</P>
<P>We followed the &s;ound of a fiddle into a little ale|hou&s;e, and walked up &s;tairs into a room full of pea&s;|ants and tobacco. There were four girls jumping a|bout which they called dancing, and thirty or forty men &s;itting round with their pipes and tabacco, admi|ring the activity of the nymphs, and rolling out &s;uch clouds of &s;moke, that we were &s;oon obliged to with|draw to avoid &s;uffocation. From thence we went to a barn to &s;ee a Dutch tragedy and farce. Two of the actre&s;&s;es were tolerably pretty. But Dutch, even from the mouth of beauty, would be an antidote to love.</P>
<P>Leaving Rotterdam, we went to Delft in the treck|&s;chuyte, and walked through the town to the Hague|gate, where we found the boat ju&s;t ready to pu&s;h off. The canal from thence to Ry&s;wick is &s;kirted with rows of elms. In&s;tead of going on to the Hague, we got out at the bridge, and walked down to the village, at about half a mile's di&s;tance. The palace is old, unre|paired and unfurni&s;hed; famous only for the peace
<PB N="139" REF="031692_0462_0FEE21A2CDAE3A50">
made there, &s;o advantageous to the Dutch, by the con|federate powers of Europe, with Lewis XIV. in 1697. The Prince now and then comes there for half an hour, and amu&s;es him&s;elf with cour&s;ing hares in the court yard, which is within a wall about fifty yards &s;quare. A very princely recreation!</P>
<P>We dined at the Strack-huis, and met with a com|fortable repa&s;t, which we little expected in &s;uch a place. In the cool of the evening we walked to the Hague, at the di&s;tance of two &s;hort miles, under the &s;hade of a row of elms.</P>
<P>The Hague in French, <HI>la Haye, the Hedge,</HI> is only a village, not being walled, nor &s;ending deputies to the &s;tates. Neverthele&s;s, it is the re&s;idence of all the for|eign amba&s;&s;adors, the &s;eat of government, and, with|out di&s;pute, the mo&s;t beautiful place on earth. On the &s;outh &s;ide lies Delft, on the north the hou&s;e in the Wood, Scheveling, and the &s;ea to the we&s;t, and the great canal to Leyden on the ea&s;t.</P>
<P>The Hague is totally &s;urrounded with a canal, over which are many bridges, and a row of lofty trees bor|ders the water's edge. The &s;treets are &s;o &s;pacious, and &s;o much adorned with trees and water, that you can &s;carce conceive your&s;elf in a town; and there are &s;o many &s;quares and public places laid out in &s;hady walks, and &s;urrounded with &s;uch magnificent buildings, that it beggars all de&s;cription.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="031692_0463_0FEE21A4551E5388">
I will mention two or three of the mo&s;t &s;triking parts of the Hague, among which I think the Vyverburg has the pre-eminence. It is a kind of &s;quare, con&s;i&s;t|ing of &s;everal &s;hady walks; on one &s;ide, a row of mag|nificent hou&s;es; on the other, the Vyver, which is a large ba&s;on of water faced with &s;tone, two hundred yards in length, and near one hundred in breadth. In the centre of it is an i&s;land planted with trees. One end of the Vyverburg opens to the Voor-hout, which is a large plantation of trees, in the Middle of which is the Mall, railed in on both &s;ides. It is &s;trewed with &s;hells, as are all the walks in Holland, there being neither &s;tone nor gravel in the whole country. The walks are con&s;equently unplea&s;ant, as the &s;hells never bind, but crumble into du&s;t, and feel like loo&s;e &s;and under your feet.</P>
<P>The New Prince&s;s Graft is a row of palaces, rather than of hou&s;es, which front the wood, from which they are divided by a broad pavement and a canal. Ca&s;uari|&s;treet is adjoining, in which is the French Play-hou&s;e, a neat little theatre. We were at the Comedy on Fri|day evening. The actors were tolerably good.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not omit mentioning the Prince Graft, which is half a mile in length, proportionably broad, and per|fectly &s;traight, with a canal &s;haded with trees, running through the mid&s;t of it, over which are thrown many fine &s;tone bridges, with iron rails on them.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="031692_0464_0FEE21A5DC92E930">
One of the greate&s;t curio&s;ities in the Hague, is the Prince's cabinet, which is open at twelve o'clock on Fridays, and acce&s;&s;ible to all &s;trangers, who previou&s;ly &s;end their names. This hou&s;e was purcha&s;ed of the Counte&s;s of Albemarle, faces the Vyver, and is &s;ituat|ed at the corner of the Outer Court, where the hor&s;e|guards parade.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t room you &s;ee a &s;mall, but mo&s;t excellent collection of Chine&s;e &s;words, knives, and other in&s;tru|ments in gold, richly inlaid with precious &s;tones; and ear-rings, bracelets, and much female ornament and apparel. In the next apartment is a good collection of &s;hells, among which the Concha Veneris did not e&s;|cape my notice; the &s;hape being entirely analagous to the name.</P>
<P>In the third room is a brilliant &s;how of precious &s;tones, fo&s;&s;ils, minerals, and petrifactions. The fourth apartment is filled with various kinds of &s;erpents and &s;mall animals; and the la&s;t room is ornamented with a large collection of birds extremely well pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the be&s;t part of the Cabinet, and there are many rare &s;pecies among them; but the collection is now eclip&s;ed by that which has been &s;ince collected by Sir A&s;hton Lever, and is now exhibited at London by Mr. Parkin&s;on.</P>
<P>The di&s;po&s;ition and neatne&s;s of the whole is admira|ble, and well worthy of a &s;tranger's attention.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="031692_0465_0FEE21A94E49E1F8">
The palace of the &s;tadtholder is &s;ituated in the center of the town, &s;urrounded by a moat. Its external ap|pearance is not very &s;triking, being an old irregular building; but a finer collection of pictures by the Dutch and Flemi&s;h ma&s;ters I have never &s;een; e&s;pe|cially in a little room called the Study, filled by the mo&s;t capital painters.</P>
<P>The Virgin, with the ble&s;&s;ed Infant in her arms, by Raphael; Adam and Eve in Paradi&s;e, &s;urrounded with birds and bea&s;ts, by Brughel; Portraits, by Rembrandt, Vandyke, and Hans Holbein. A Dutch kitchen full of game, fi&s;h, and fle&s;h, mo&s;t admirably done, by Ten|iers. Many land&s;capes and fancy pieces, by Gabriel Metzu, Jan-Steen, Potter, and Wouvermans. I look on this room to be complete. There is not a picture, but may be dwelt on with delight.</P>
<P>In the other apartments among many fine pieces, you will find a very large one by Potter, painted in 1647. The de&s;ign is a pea&s;ant looking at his cattle. The flies on the cows &s;eem alive, and a toad &s;itting on the gra&s;s has equal excellence.</P>
<P>Abraham &s;acrificing I&s;aac, in ivory, is inimitably carved.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome fruit and game pieces by Weeninx, well done; and &s;ome excellent pieces on copper, by Rothenamer.</P>
<P>At a church near the Hague we &s;aw many &s;torks walking about as tame as our turkies. They are &s;ome.
<PB N="143" REF="031692_0466_0FEE21B06B6E31D0">
what in &s;hape like a heron. Their colour is white, and their wings are tipped with black. They live upon the offal of the fi&s;h-market, which is near the church. I have &s;een numbers of them in the meadows, though they are e&s;teemed birds of pa&s;&s;age, and in autumn they are not very common. The vul|gar error is, that the&s;e birds are &s;o fond of liberty, that they will live only in a republic. I am &s;ure, in point of policy, they cannot live in a more de&s;irable country, as they have fi&s;h and frogs in abundance for their food, and the utmo&s;t &s;ecurity for them&s;elves, it being deem|ed a crime to mal-treat or kill them.</P>

<P>WE went in the treck&s;chuyte to Leyden with a Dutch General we had lived with at the Table d'Hote at the Hague. The di&s;tance was only ten miles; but the whole canal being edged with &s;ummer-hou&s;es and gardens belonging to the inhabitants of tho&s;e towns, who in the &s;ummer retire to the&s;e little boxes, made the &s;cene appear mo&s;t beautiful, and the di&s;tance nothing.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="031692_0467_0FEE21B1F2E61B08">
When we arrived at the inn we were recommended to, we found it filled by the French Amba&s;&s;ador and his train; and for want of an interpreter we wandered about the town till it was dark, and met with two or three di&s;agreeable circum&s;tances, which made me la|ment my ignorance of the Dutch language; but at length we found the <HI>Golden Ball,</HI> an Engli&s;h hou&s;e, and with my wants vani&s;hed my de&s;ire of talking Dutch.</P>
<P>Leyden is e&s;teemed, in point of &s;ize, the &s;econd ci|ty in Holland, but its trade is now incon&s;iderable, which in the woollen manufactory was formerly very exten&s;ive. The city is &s;urrounded with a rampart and a wide canal. The mo&s;t elegant &s;treet is the Broad|&s;treet, which runs from the Hague-gate to the Utrecht|gate. It is a little on the curve, which adds, I think, much to its beauty. The pavement is extremely fine, and the &s;treet ri&s;es in the center like the new paved &s;treets in London. It is very &s;pacious, as indeed are mo&s;t of the &s;treets in Leyden.</P>
<P>Among the canals the Rapinbury is the mo&s;t beautiful. The hou&s;es are magnificent; the bridges &s;tone, with iron rails; and there are trees on each &s;ide of the canal. It is &s;aid that there are 145 bridges, and 180 &s;treets in the city of Leyden. The Old Rhine runs through this town, and lo&s;es it&s;elf in the little village of Catwick, which lies in the neighbourhood.</P>

<P>The Academy abounds with many curio&s;ities. It is there the profe&s;&s;ors read lectures to the &s;tudents who lodge in the town, and are not di&s;tingui&s;hed by any academical habit. It is there that the learned Scaliger, Lip&s;ius, Salma&s;ius, and Boerhaave gained &s;o much re|putation by their lectures, and brought &s;tudents from all parts of Europe to attend them.</P>
<P>The Botanic Garden has always been one of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable in Europe, both on account of the famous profe&s;&s;ors who have pre&s;ided over it, and the number of curious exotics growing in it as may be &s;een in Boerhaave's and Van Royen's catalogues. It is nicely arranged, and kept in excellent order.</P>
<P>On one &s;ide of the&s;e gardens is a very curious col|lection of antique marbles, given by Gerard Papen|brochius, a burgo-ma&s;ter of Am&s;terdam. I cannot o|mit
<PB N="146" REF="031692_0469_0FEE21BA9AAD77C0">
mentioning the &s;tatues of Hercules, of Bacchus leaning on a fawn, attended by a tyger, of an Abun|dantia as big as the life, and of a naked Apollo; all which have e&s;pecial merit.</P>
<P>Adjoining to the &s;tatues is the Natural Philo&s;ophy School, in which lectures are read. You will find in it a good collection of natural curio&s;ities; &s;ome very fine petrifactions; in particular, a piece of oak, one &s;ide of which has been poli&s;hed, and vies both in hardne&s;s and colour with an agate. Some curious pieces of cry&s;tal, formed by nature to an apex, with &s;ix angles, as exact and as finely poli&s;hed as if the production of art. A fi&s;h called the Medu&s;a's Head, from a thou&s;and little fibres darting out from its body in a circle like twi&s;ted rays. This, in it&s;elf, is very curious; but the exact repre&s;entation of it in a natural agate, is much more &s;o.</P>
<P>But I think one of the greate&s;t curio&s;ities is the a&s;be&s;|tos from Tran&s;ylvania. It is a &s;tone with a &s;oft down on it like velvet, of a dove colour. Of this is made both paper and linen; we &s;aw &s;amples of both. The very peculiar property of it is, that fire has no effect on it, for it &s;till continues its form unchanged and un|con&s;umed.</P>
<P>Among the bea&s;ts was an ermine, about the &s;ize and &s;hape of a wea&s;el. This little animal is &s;o fearful of
<PB N="147" REF="031692_0470_0FEE21BC22178DE8">
dirtying its &s;kin, that it would &s;ooner lo&s;e its liberty than its cleanline&s;s.</P>
<P>There was a kind of toad which brings forth its young from its back. On ob&s;erving it, we perceived infinite numbers of young toads adhering to the back, which appeared like the broken &s;cales of a fi&s;h.</P>
<P>The toad-fi&s;h from America is an extraordinary crea|ture. It is for the fir&s;t &s;ix months a toad, then changes by degrees into a fi&s;h. This had half completed its transformation, having the tail of a fi&s;h, with the head and fore parts of a toad.</P>
<P>The Penna Marina belongs to the animal &s;pecies. It is the production of the ocean, looks like a plant, and is nothing more than a &s;tem of about two inches long with a kind of feather at the end of it, not unlike a quill with part of the feathers cut off.</P>
<P>Among the feathered race, the mo&s;t curious was the Hydracorax Indicus; the only one in Europe; larger than a turkey&mdash;black&mdash;"Ro&s;tro unicorni, cornu, re|curvo,"&mdash;if I may expre&s;s my&s;elf in the technical terms of Ornithology.</P>
<P>There was an immen&s;e bea&s;t, called the Hippopota|mus, as large as an elephant, its colour black, with a row of grinders in the interior part of its mouth, be|&s;ides a good number in front.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. LXXIX. OF AMSTERDAM.</HEAD>
<P>AMSTERDAM is &s;ituated on the river Am&s;tel, and an arm of the &s;ea called the Y, at the mouth of the Zuyder Sea, and is built in the form of a cre&s;cent. It is fortified with a fo&s;&s;e of great depth and width, with a rampart of earth faced with brick, &s;trengthened with twenty-&s;ix ba&s;tions, in each of which &s;tands a wind|mill, ornamented with eight magnificent gates of free|&s;tone, built either in a &s;emi-circular or octagonal &s;hape. In all the chief &s;treets are canals &s;haded with trees, the grande&s;t of which is the Heere-gra&s;t, or canal of Lords. This is the place of re&s;idence for the bankers and chief merchants; for here every one is in trade. The few nobles of Holland re&s;ide always at the Hague. Tho&s;e &s;treets in which there are no canals, are vilely narrow. The Ne&s;s, in which we live, I had the curio&s;ity to mea|&s;ure, and it is only &s;ixteen feet wide. The hou&s;es are lofty, and the bridges are chiefly of &s;tone.</P>
<P>The &s;quares are neither &s;pacious nor elegant. The dam is the large&s;t, in which the &s;tadt-hou&s;e is &s;ituated; but it is irregular, and vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ely disfigured by a weighing hou&s;e. The others no more de&s;erve the name of &s;quares, than Clare-market or Palace yard, We&s;tmin&s;ter.</P>
<P>This populous city contained 26,035 hou&s;es in 1732,
<PB N="149" REF="031692_0472_0FEE21C2EC999A40">
and is &s;uppo&s;ed, according to the be&s;t calculation, to contain at pre&s;ent 250,000 inhabitants, though it was at the beginning of the thirteenth century, an incon&s;id|erable fi&s;hing village on the edge of a mora&s;s, which is now covered with buildings, erected upon piles of tim|ber, driven into the earth, at immen&s;e labour and ex|pence. For the foundation only of one tower, 6000 trees were rammed into the ground. Notwith&s;tand|ing the&s;e precautions, the magi&s;trates are &s;o apprehen|&s;ive of the foundations, that very few coaches are li|cen&s;ed. The carriages in general are fixed on &s;ledges, drown by one hor&s;e, the driver attending on foot.</P>
<P>There are fifteen churches of the e&s;tabli&s;hed, that is, the Calvini&s;tic religion, which are &s;erved by thirty mi|ni&s;ters, equal in authority and revenue. They are al|lowed two hundred and forty pounds per annum each, which is paid by the city.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t &s;tupendous undertaking in this city is the Stadt hou&s;e, which you enter by &s;even &s;mall gates par|allel to each other, in&s;tead of one magnificent portal, equal to a front, which extends it&s;elf 282 feet, who&s;e heighth is 116, and the breadth 232 feet. The build|ing is of &s;tone, with pillars of the Corinthian order. It is erected on 13,659 piles of timber, and was fini&s;hed in 1655. On the top is a &s;tatue of Alas in bra&s;s, bear|ing on his &s;houlders a copper globe, &s;aid to be larger than that of St. Peter's at Rome; and on the center is a cupola, from whence is an exten&s;ive view of the city
<PB N="150" REF="031692_0473_0FEE21C82DF0D958">
and its environs. The piles co&s;t 100,000l. The whole expence was computed at two millions. Ver|&s;ailles co&s;t only 800,000l; the E&s;curial, one million; and St. Paul's, one million five hundred thou&s;and pounds. It is upon record, that St. Peter's at Rome, with all that is contained in it, has co&s;t near thirteen millions &s;terling.</P>
<P>The cornices of the rooms are finely carved, the floors laid with marble, and the &s;ides of the apartments <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ined either with marble or valuable paintings. Over the doors and chimney-pieces are &s;everal hi&s;torical pieces in ba&s;&s;o relievo, inimitably executed in Italian marble. And there are &s;ome deceptions in a kind of grey painting, to imitate ba&s;&s;o relievo, (e&s;pecially of &s;ome children) by De-Wit, &s;o finely touched, that the mo&s;t critical eye at half the di&s;tance of the room would be deceived.</P>
<P>A large piece, by Vanderhel&s;t, is de&s;ervedly e&s;teem|ed. It is a fea&s;t given to the Spani&s;h Amba&s;&s;ador by the burgo-ma&s;ters of Am&s;terdam, on the making peace between the two countries in 1648. But the be&s;t piece is by Vandyke, which repre&s;ents an enter|tainment, where you &s;ee the portraits of all the con|&s;iderable per&s;ons of the city. An old grey haired man is &s;o much admired in this wonderful picture, that &s;even thou&s;and guilders were offered to cut out the head.</P>

The Stadt-hou&s;e is admirably contrived for public utility. Here is the bank, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the riche&s;t in Europe; here are the courts of ju&s;tice, the pri&s;ons for criminals and debtors, the chambers of the Senate, the Trea&s;ury, the magazine of arms, and in &s;hort, all the public offices, with eight large ci&s;terns of water on the top, with pipes to every room to extingui&s;h fires. The citizens hall is the grande&s;t, being one hundred and twenty feet by fifty-&s;even, and ninety feet high: It is paved with marble, in which are &s;tained the ter|re&s;trial and cele&s;tial globes. The &s;ides, the roof, and the pillars, are all of marble; but there always is &s;ome|thing wanting;&mdash;there is not light enough to ad|mire with accuracy the wonderful magnificence of this apartment.</P>
<P>From the Stadt-hou&s;e you cro&s;s the Dam to the Ex|change, which is not to be compared with that of Rot|terdam in beauty, nor to our Royal Exchange in &s;ize. The building is of brick, and at full change, if appear|ances may be relied on, was crowded with the mo&s;t blackguard fellows on the face of the earth. In the afternoon I paid a &s;econd vi&s;it to the Exchange, to &s;ee the city militia perform their exerci&s;e; to which every man is &s;ubject, unle&s;s he makes a pecuniary compen&s;a|tion. Tho&s;e, therefore, who from their poverty can|not, or from their avarice, will not pay the fine, are o|bliged to &s;erve. Here penury and par&s;imony were
<PB N="152" REF="031692_0475_0FEE21CB44283968">
collected together in &s;uch various habits (for they have no regular uniform) as to make the mo&s;t ludicrous group imagination can &s;ugge&s;t. A giant and a dwarf, a Fal&s;taff and a &s;lender, a bob wig and &s;hock head of hair, in coats of all the colours of the rainbow, joined mo&s;t heterogeneou&s;ly together to form a rank, in which every man followed his own invention, in as many dif|ferent attitudes and manoeuvres, as there were men to make them.</P>
<P>In the evening we went to the theatre, which, like all playhou&s;es, our own excepted, is dark, long, and &s;mall. The pit is excellent, having &s;eats with low backs, and marked with numbers, to di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of each per&s;on, by which, both crowding and di&s;|putes are prevented. This is the only hou&s;e I ever &s;aw abroad, in which there are &s;eats in the pit, or <HI>parterre,</HI> as it is called. It is under the contro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">l and direction of the city. The magi&s;trates receive the money, defray the charges, and pay the actors. The re&s;idue is appli|ed to the maintenance of the poor, and to the &s;upport of the different ho&s;pitals.</P>
<P>Every rope dancer, puppet-player, as well as all oth|ers who pretend to entertain the public, are obliged to contribute one third of their profits towards the main|tenance of the poor.</P>
<P>On Friday we looked into the Ra&s;p hou&s;e, which is a pri&s;on for criminals, as well as for children who
<PB N="153" REF="031692_0476_0FEE21D08C0024C0">
are profligate or di&s;obedient. The former are confin|ed in a &s;mall room, chained to a block, and &s;pend their whole time in fawing or <HI>ra&s;ping</HI> Brazil wood, or in other work equally laborious. I was &s;hocked at the &s;ight of &s;o many of my &s;pecies, naked to the wai&s;t, worn out with labour, pale with confinement, and emaciated by want. Yet how much wi&s;er this method than the Engli&s;h law, which, for thirteen pence deprives a man of his life, and the king of a &s;ubject, whom the Dutch &s;how us may be made u&s;eful to the public.</P>
<P>From thence we went to the Spin-hou&s;e, for the correction, but not, I think, for the amendment of loo&s;e women, as every one is permitted to &s;ee and con|ver&s;e with them through the rails, which can only har|den them in impudence. We walked into the New Church to &s;ee a burial. In this nation of indu&s;try, time is too precious to be complimented away on the dead, who can make them no return; therefore the ceremony of prayers is laid a&s;ide as &s;uperfluous. The coffin is in&s;tantly put into the grave, which is imme|diately filled up. The relations bow, and return to their avocations. The organ in this church is inferi|or only to the organ at Harlem. The partition which divides the chancel from the nave, is of Corinthian bra&s;s. The &s;ounding board over the pulpit is ju&s;tly admired for the inimitable carving with which it is or|namented. From thence we proceeded to the Admi|ralty
<PB N="154" REF="031692_0477_0FEE21D3EEF2D450">
and Dock-yard, which are &s;ituated at the extrem|ity of the quay. The Admiralty forms three &s;ides of a &s;quare, in the middle of which is the yard for build|ing of the men of war; the fourth &s;ide is open to the water. Here is not an appearance to be feared by the Engli&s;h, though much to be admired for the excellent order in which the arms and &s;tores are di&s;po&s;ed.</P>
<P>Among the number of ho&s;pitals in this city, the Ga&s;t-hou&s;e for the &s;ick is the mo&s;t worthy a &s;tranger's vi&s;iting. It is an elegant &s;tone quadrangle, at the end of which are &s;ome neat little &s;hops for toys, lace, &amp;c. The revenue of this ho&s;pital is computed at eight thou&s;and pounds &s;terling a year, which is a large &s;um; but the General ho&s;pital for men at Madrid, contains one thou&s;and five hundred iron beds, and its revenue amounts to forty thou&s;and doubloons; about thirty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling.</P>
<P>There is an ho&s;pital where all poor travellers with|out di&s;tinction are lodged and entertained for three nights and no longer.</P>
<P>It is computed that twenty thou&s;and &s;ouls are main|tained in the different ho&s;pitals, which are either en|dowed or &s;upported out of the public revenue, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the contributions of the charitable: for which purpo&s;e, men belonging to the ho&s;pitals go twice a week to every hou&s;e begging for alms.</P>
<P>On Saturday morning we went to the Portugue&s;e

Synagogue; which is a large &s;pacious building filled with a numerous congregation. The women &s;it togeth|er in a gallery, with lattices before them.

<P>There are &s;ome regulations in the police of Am&s;ter|dam, which would be well worthy of imitation in London. You never meet a watchman alone; two al|ways walk together, by which means they add &s;trength as well as give courage to each other. Many a hou&s;e is broke open in London, and many a &s;ober citizen is knocked down in the pre&s;ence of a watchman, who ei|ther from fear or knavery &s;uffers the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">illains to e&s;cape.</P>
<P>There is another admirable cu&s;tom to prevent the &s;preading of fire, by giving almo&s;t an immediate alarm. On the tops of four churches, &s;ituated at four dif|ferent quarters of the city, watchmen are fixed during the night, who are obliged to &s;ound a trumpet every half hour, as a &s;ignal of their being awake and on their duty. On the breaking out of a fire they ring the a|larm bell, which calls their brethren to the &s;pot in a moment. Of what &s;ervice would a plan &s;omething &s;imilar to this be in our metropolis!</P>

There are few general conveniences which carry not a mi&s;chief along with them. Canals, for in&s;tance, are great ornaments to the &s;treets, and of infinite u&s;e to the inhabitants; but the mi&s;chief is, that many an hone&s;t man loo&s;es his life in Am&s;terdam, who in Lon|don would only lo&s;e his money; for the villains fir&s;t rob him, and then pu&s;h him into the canal, to prevent his telling tales; thus charitably ea&s;ing him of his mo|ney, le&s;t the weight of it &s;hould &s;ink him.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not omit mentioning the neatne&s;s of the peo|ple; but in this they have no merit: for the neat|ne&s;s of their hou&s;es and cleanline&s;s of their towns pro|ceed from nece&s;&s;ity. Such is the moi&s;ture of the air, that were it not for the&s;e cu&s;toms, pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es would be the con&s;equence, which, careful as they are, now often happen. This perpetual dampne&s;s in the atmo&s;phere ru&s;ts metals and moulds wood, which obliges the inhabitants, not from a principle of neatne&s;s, but of oeconomy, by &s;couring the one and painting the other, to &s;eek a prevention or a cure. Hence ari&s;es the neatne&s;s, which by people who judge only by ap|pearances is called <HI>natural;</HI> but indeed mo&s;t national cu&s;toms are the effects of unob&s;erved cau&s;es and ne|ce&s;&s;ities.

Add to this natural defence, a dyke of twenty feet high, twenty-five feet broad at the bottom, and about ten at top, running parallel to the high-water mark. This is made of clay, &s;trengthened towards the land with planks and &s;tone, towards the water with ru&s;hes, &s;ea-weeds, and flags &s;taked down, which give way to the force of the waves, and re&s;ume their place again, when they retire.

Facts &s;o extraordinary require explanation. Let it then be remembered, that this &s;tate was founded on Liberty and Religion; was reared by Indu&s;try and OEconomy, and has flouri&s;hed by its &s;ituation and com|merce. The bigotted maxims of Philip II, the intro|duction of the inqui&s;ition, and the erecting of four|teen new bi&s;hopricks in the Low Countries, the unre|lenting rigour of the Cardinal Granville, and the &s;uc|ceeding cruelty of the Duke of Alvah, together with the Council of Twelve, called the council of Blood, and the execution of Count Egmont and Horn, were the cau&s;es which drove the people to &s;hake off the yoke, and gave ri&s;e to the union of Utrecht. Per&s;e|vering valour, joined to the political a&s;&s;i&s;tance of oth|er powers, has been the means of their pre&s;erving their independence, while the decline of the Venetian navy has made them the common carriers of Europe, and the wars in Flanders and &s;ituation of Holland have con|&s;pired to render Am&s;terdam the &s;eat of univer&s;al com|merce.</P>
<P>Till the beginning of the &s;ixteenth century, Venice by its &s;hipping, and Florence by its manufactories, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed the whole trade of Europe, Per&s;ia, and the Indies; but the di&s;covery of a pa&s;&s;age to the Ea&s;t, by the Cape of Good-Hope, and the &s;ettlements of the Portugue&s;e in India, proved fatal to the republic of Venice. Li&s;|bon then became the &s;taple of the trade to the Ea&s;t-In|dies,
<PB N="159" REF="031692_0482_0FEE21E4E1EF7830">
and the Ea&s;terlings who inhabited the Hans Towns were the great merchants of the North.&mdash;They brought commerce fir&s;t to Bruges, and from thence to Antwerp, which the revolt of the Netherlands drew afterwards to Holland. The Dutch likewi&s;e, by their &s;ucce&s;s a|gain&s;t the Portugue&s;e in India, and by their treaties with the natives, in proce&s;s of time drew the whole trade of India from Li&s;bon.</P>
<P>Their country is mo&s;t admirably &s;ituated for the trade of the Baltic, which includes Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Ru&s;&s;ia, Poland, and the North coa&s;t of Ger|many, while they &s;end merchandize into the interior parts of the Empire and the Au&s;trian Netherlands, by the Rhine, Mae&s;e, and Scheld. It mu&s;t likewi&s;e be con&s;idered, that each town values it&s;elf upon &s;ome par|ticular branch of trade, by which it is improved to the utmo&s;t: as for in&s;tance, Delft, for the Dutch porce|lain, Sardam for &s;hip building; Rotterdam for the Scotch and Engli&s;h trade; Am&s;terdam for that of the Streights, Spain, and the Ea&s;t-Indies; and the whole province for the Herring Fi&s;hery, which &s;upplies the &s;outhern parts of Europe. Thus the greatne&s;s of this country has ari&s;en from a wonderful concurrence of circum&s;tances; from a long cour&s;e of time; from the confluence of &s;trangers, driven either by per&s;ecution, or invited by the credit of their government; from the cheapne&s;s of carriage by the convenience of the

canals; from the low intere&s;t of money and dearne&s;s of land, which con&s;equently turn &s;pecie into trade; from particular traffic carried on at particular places; from their inten&s;e application to their navy; from the va&s;t nur&s;eries for their &s;ailors, and from their amazing acqui&s;itions in the Ea&s;t-Indies.

<P>THE head-dre&s;s of the women in North Holland is very extraordinary. They have a little hair cut &s;hort and thin, which is combed down on the forehead and powdered. The cap &s;ticks clo&s;e to their ears, under which are two little pieces of &s;ilver or gold which ap|pear at each temple, and a large piece like a broad rib|bon is under the cap on the back part of the head.</P>
<P>A &s;ingular cu&s;tom is likewi&s;e retained in this coun|try of having a door in every hou&s;e, which is never o|pened but when a corp&s;e is carried out, which mu&s;t be

brought through that door, and no other. I think there is &s;omething uncommonly &s;olemn in it; and &s;uch a door in every hou&s;e would be an admirable memen|to to the family.</P>
<P>Having made the tour of the whole Province of Holland, and &s;uffered nothing curious to e&s;cape me, my head, at pre&s;ent, is a confu&s;ed medley of dykes and pictures, churches and canals, bridges and &s;tadthou&s;es, but a void in re&s;pect to the cu&s;toms, police, and man|ners of the people, the only u&s;eful knowledge to be ac|quired by travelling.</P>
<P>I have &s;een enough to confirm me in the ju&s;tne&s;s of Sir William Temple's opinion, who, in &s;peaking of Holland, if my memory mi&s;leads me not, &s;ays, "That it is a country where the earth is better than the air, and profit more in reque&s;t than honour; where there is more &s;en&s;e than wit, more good-nature than good-humour, and more wealth than plea&s;ure; where a man would chu&s;e rather to travel than to live; &s;hall find more things to ob&s;erve than de&s;ire; and more per|&s;ons to e&s;teem than to love."</P>

<P>THE approach to the city of Antwerp is noble, by a &s;traight paved road bordered with oaks. It is the capital of the province who&s;e name it bears, belonging to the Au&s;trian Netherlands, and under the dominion of the Emperor. It is &s;ituated on the ea&s;tern &s;hore of the Scheld, a noble river, twenty feet deep at low wa|ter; &s;o that &s;hips of great burden may unload upon the quays, or enter the town by eight canals, which com|municate with the river, &s;ome of which are large enough to contain an hundred &s;hips at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>The city is much decayed from its ancient grandeur though it &s;till remains a beautiful place. It is built in the form of a cre&s;ent, about &s;even miles in circumfer|ence, &s;urrounded with a wall and ba&s;tions faced with &s;tone. The top of the wall is an hundred feet broad, with a double row of trees, between which is a mo&s;t a|greeable walk. The &s;treets are well paved, very &s;pa|cious and uniform. The hou&s;es in general are &s;even or eight &s;tories high, but old, and in that mi&s;erable &s;tyle of building which di&s;graces the towns in Holland. At the di&s;tance of a quarter of a mile is the citadel, built by the Duke of Alva, to keep the city in &s;ub|jection. It &s;tands on the banks of the Scheld, and
<PB N="163" REF="031692_0486_0FEE21F26D14C580">
commands at once the river, the city, and the adjacent country. It is built in a pentagonal form, with five ba&s;tions, which defend each other, &s;urrounded with double ditches.</P>
<P>To this citadel is only one entrance, which is over a draw-bridge. It is about a mile in circumference, and well &s;upplied with arms, amunition, and all war|like &s;tores, with barracks for three thou&s;and men. This fortre&s;s has been of &s;uch repute for &s;trength and regu|larity, that it has been a model for &s;ub&s;equent engi|neers; notwith&s;tanding which the French in 1746 took it in &s;even days.</P>
<P>The trade of Antwerp is now confined to very nar|row limits, though &s;o late as the middle of the &s;ixteenth century, there were two hundred thou&s;and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> two thou&s;and five hundred &s;hips lying often in the riv|er at a time; and it was far from unfrequent for five hundred ve&s;&s;els to come in or go out of the harbour in a day.</P>
<P>The trade of Antwerp in the year 1550, if the an|nals of their city can be relied on, amounted to one hundred and thirty-three millions of gold, without in|cluding the bank.</P>
<P>As an in&s;tance of the amazing opulence of the mer|chants, there is a &s;tory upon record, of John Daens, a merchant, who lent a million of gold to Charles V. to carry on his wars in Hungary. The Emperor on his
<PB N="164" REF="031692_0487_0FEE21F5CE9BF998">
return dined with the merchant, who gave him a mo&s;t &s;umptuous entertainment, and at the clo&s;e of it burnt the contract by which the emperor was bound to pay him a million of gold, in a fire of cinnamon, which was the only fire during the repa&s;t.</P>
<P>The ri&s;e of their trade was as rapid as the decline, and both proceeded from the &s;ame cau&s;es. At the be|ginning of the &s;ixteenth century Bruges was the mart of Europe; but the war at that time breaking out in Flanders, the merchants with-drew from Bruges, and were invited to Antwerp, as a place of greater &s;afety, who&s;e &s;ituation was happily calculated for commerce. But this did not la&s;t long, for the civil wars breaking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in the Low Countries, and Antwerp having twice been &s;acked, drove trade to &s;eek a more peaceful re|fuge in Am&s;terdam.</P>
<P>The e&s;tabli&s;hed religion is the Catholic; the lan|guage Low Dutch! but a ba&s;tard kind of French is &s;poken by mo&s;t of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>We have been &s;o fortunate as to &s;ee a grand proce&s;|&s;ion in honour of St. Rocque. The whole Mer, the mo&s;t magnificent &s;treet in Antwerp, was illuminated with torches, and many hundred people in proce&s;&s;ion with flambeaux, followed by the Virgin Mary, pre|cious relicks, the Ho&s;t, and an infinity of &s;uch kind of

<P>The whole road from Antwerp to Bru&s;&s;els is delight|ful. Bru&s;&s;els is the capital of Brabant and of all the Au&s;trian Netherlands. It is the re&s;idence of the Gov|ernor-General of the Low Countries. It is twenty-four miles &s;outh of Antwerp, and thirty &s;outh-ea&s;t of Ghent, &s;ituated on the Senne, an incon&s;iderable river. The &s;cite of this city re&s;embles Guildford, being built on the brow of a hill. Its figure is oval, about four miles in circumference, &s;urrounded with a wall and tolerably fortified. The Low Town has the benefit of canals, which admit boats of co&s;iderable burden.</P>
<P>The upper town is magnificent, and has lately been much improved by new buildings, and by inclo&s;ing a piece of wai&s;t ground, planting it, and laying it out in walks.</P>

<P>Ju&s;t below the ar&s;enal is the Palace of the gover|nor of the Au&s;trian Netherlands. The pre&s;ent palace is not more than half fini&s;hed.

<P>The &s;tairca&s;e of the pre&s;ent palace is very magnifi|cent. The &s;teps are of marble, and the balu&s;trade of iron, gilt, and adorned with compartments of birds and bea&s;ts, nicely executed in poli&s;hed &s;teel by Trie&s;te. The ceiling is painted of Fre&s;co.</P>
<P>The apartment of the Prince&s;s is hung with the Bru&s;&s;els tape&s;try, which is brought to great perfection. The floors are all inlaid with mahogany and box. The Prince&s;s's cabinet is much admired, being covered throughout with the fine&s;t Japan. The late Prince was a great mechanic, and had a cabinet of curio&s;ities tri|fling enough, among which were two boxes, contain|ing all the common trades in miniature.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. LXXXII. OF BARCELONA IN SPAIN.</HEAD>
<P>THIS city is a &s;weet &s;pot. The air equals in pu|rity, and much excels in mildne&s;s, the boa&s;ted climate of Montpelier. Except in the dog-days, you may have green pea&s;e all the year round. The &s;ituation is beautiful, appearance both from land and &s;ea remark|ably picture&s;que. A Great extent of fruitful plains, bounded by an amphitheatre of hills, backs it on the we&s;t &s;ide; the mountain of Montjuich defends it on the &s;outh from the unwhole&s;ome winds that blow over the ma&s;hes at the mouth of the Llobregat; to the north|ward, the coa&s;t projecting into the &s;ea forms a noble bay; it has the Mediterranean to clo&s;e the pro&s;pect to the ea&s;t. The environs are in a &s;tate of high culti|vation, &s;tudded with villages, country hou&s;es, and gar|dens.</P>
<P>The form of Barcelona is almo&s;t circular, the Ro|man town being on the highe&s;t ground in the center of the new one. The ancient walls are &s;till vi&s;ible in &s;everal places; but the &s;ea has retired many hundreds of yards from the portgates. One of the principal Gothic churches, and a whole quarter of the city, &s;tand upon the &s;ands that were once the bottom of the har|bour. The immen&s;e loads of &s;and hurried down into
<PB N="168" REF="031692_0491_0FEE22018C3941D8">
the &s;ea by the rivers, and thrown back by wind and current into this haven, will in all probability, choak it quite up, unle&s;s greater diligence be u&s;ed in prevent|ing the gathering of the &s;hoals. A &s;outherly wind brings in the &s;and, and already a deep-loaded ve&s;&s;el finds its dangerous to pa&s;s over the bar. Some years a|go a company of Dutch and Engli&s;h adventurers offered to bring the river into the port by means of a canal, if government would allow them a free importation for ten years. This project might have cleared away the &s;and-banks, but might al&s;o have given a fatal check to the infant manufactures of the country; for which rea|&s;on the propo&s;al was rejected. The port is hand&s;ome; the mole is all of hewn &s;tone, a ma&s;ter-piece of &s;olidity and convenience. Above is a platform for carriages; below, va&s;t magazines, with a broad key reaching from the city gates to the light hou&s;e. This was done by the orders of the late Marquis de La Mina, captain-general of the principality, where his memory is held in greater veneration than at the court of Mad|rid. He governed Catalonia many years, more like an independant &s;overeign, than like a &s;ubject inve&s;ted with a delegated authority. Great are the obligations Bar|celona has to him. He clean&s;ed and beautified its &s;treets, built u&s;eful edifices, and forwarded its trade and manufactures, without much extraordinary ex|pence to the province; for he had more re&s;ources, and
<PB N="169" REF="031692_0492_0FEE2208A0031950">
made money go father than mo&s;t other governors can do, or indeed wi&s;h to do.</P>
<P>The citadel has &s;ix &s;trong ba&s;tions, calculated to o|verawe the inhabitants, at lea&s;t as much as to defend them from a foreign enemy. The lowne&s;s of its &s;itu|ation renders it damp, unwhole&s;ome, and &s;warming with mu&s;quitos. The major of this fortre&s;s owes his promotion to a &s;ingular circum&s;tance. When the pre&s;ent king arrived at Madrid in 1759, a magnificent bull-fea&s;t was given in honour of that event. As it is nece&s;&s;ary, upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, that tho&s;e who fight on hor&s;eback &s;hould be gentlemen born, the mana|gers of the exhibition were greatly at a lo&s;s; till this man, who was a poor, &s;tarving officer, pre&s;ented him|&s;elf, though utterly ignorant both of bull-fighting and hor&s;eman&s;hip. By dint of re&s;olution, and the particu|lar favour of fortune, he kept his &s;eat, and performed his part &s;o much to the public &s;atisfaction that he was rewarded with a pen&s;ion and a majority.</P>
<P>The &s;treets of Barcelona are narrow but well paved. A covered drain in the middle of each &s;treet carries off the filth and rain water. At night they are tolerably well lighted up, but long before day-break every lamp is out. The hou&s;es are lofty and plain. To each kind of trade a particular di&s;trict is allotted.</P>
<P>Catalonia, of which Barcelona is the capital, is al|mo&s;t throughout extremely mountainous. The nature
<PB N="170" REF="031692_0493_0FEE220A28216830">
of the country appears to have great influence on that of the inhabitants, who are a hardy, active, and indu&s;|trious race, of a middle &s;ize, brown complexion, and &s;trong features; their limbs well knit together, and by education and practice well inured to the greate&s;t fa|tigues. There are few lame or di&s;torted per&s;ons, or beg|gars, to be met with among them. Their <HI>mocos</HI> or mule|boys are &s;tout walkers. Some of them have been known to go from Barcelona to Madrid and back again, in nine days, which by the high road is &s;ix hundred miles.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of all the immunities, the ignominious prohibition of every weapon, even a knife, and an e|normous load of taxes, have not been able to &s;tifle their independent &s;pirit, which brakes out upon the lea&s;t &s;tretch of arbitrary power. Within the&s;e few years, many of their ancient privileges have been gradually re|&s;tored; and this is at pre&s;ent one of the mo&s;t flouri&s;h|ing provinces of Spain. Their taxation is &s;till very high. All trade is a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed according to the bu&s;ine&s;s you are &s;uppo&s;ed to tran&s;act in the cour&s;e of the year; without regard to your lo&s;s or gain.</P>
<P>Among&s;t other re&s;trictions, the u&s;e of &s;louched hats, white &s;hoes, and large brown cloaks is forbidden. Till of late, they dur&s;t not carry any kind of knife; but in each public hou&s;e there was one chained to the table for the u&s;e of all comers. The good order maintained
<PB N="171" REF="031692_0494_0FEE220D8ABCC780">
by the police, and the vigilance of the thief-takers, &s;up|ply the place of defen&s;ive weapons, robberies and mur|ders being &s;eldom heard of. You may walk the &s;treets of Barcelona at all hours unarmed, without the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ion, provided you have light; without it you are liable to be carried to pri&s;on by the patrol.</P>
<P>The Catalonians cannot brook the thought of being menial &s;ervants in their own country, but will rather trudge it all over with a pedlar's pack on their &s;houl|ders, or run about upon errands, than be the head do|me&s;tic in a Catalonian family. Far from home they make excellent &s;ervants, and mo&s;t of the principal hou&s;es of Madrid have Catalonians at the head of their affairs.</P>
<P>They are the general muleteers and cale&s;&s;ieros of Spain. You meet with them in every part of the kingdom. Their hone&s;ty, &s;teadine&s;s and &s;obriety, en|title them to the confidence of travellers, and their thir&s;t after lucre makes them bear with any hard&s;hips. With good words you will always find them docile, but they cannot bear hard u&s;uage or approbrious lan|guage.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that remain at home for the labours of the field, are exceedingly indu&s;trious. Their corn-harve&s;t is in May or early in June; but, as the&s;e crops are lia|ble to frequent bur&s;tings and mildews, they have turn|ed their attention more to the vine, which they plant
<PB N="172" REF="031692_0495_0FEE2210EFA353E8">
even to the &s;ummits of their mo&s;t rugged mountains. In many places they carry up earth to fix the young &s;et in; and in others have been known to let one a|nother down from the brow of the rock by ropes, rath|er than &s;uffer a good patch of &s;oil to remain u&s;ele&s;s. Their vintages are commonly very plentiful. This au|tumn, there was &s;uch a &s;uper abundance of grapes in the valley of Talarn, in the neighbourhood of Pallas, that whole vineyards were left untouched for want of ve&s;&s;els to make or hold the wine in. Notice was pa&s;ted upon the church-doors, that any one was at liberty to take away any quantity he plea&s;ed, on paying a &s;mall acknowledgement to the proprietors. The be&s;t red wine of Catalonia is made at Mataro, north of Barce|lona, and the be&s;t white at Sitges, between that city and Tarragona.</P>
<P>The &s;carcity of corn is &s;ometimes very great, the principality not producing above five months provi&s;ion. Without the importation from America, Sicily, and the north of Europe, it would run the ri&s;k of being fami&s;hed. From four hundred thou&s;and to &s;ix hundred thou&s;and quarters of wheat are annually imported. Canada a|lone &s;ent this year about eighty thou&s;and quarters. There are public ovens, where the bakers are bound by contract to bake every day into bread one thou|&s;and bu&s;hels of flour, or more, at a &s;tated price, and in ca&s;e the other bakers &s;hould refu&s;e to work, they are
<PB N="173" REF="031692_0496_0FEE22162B7C1098">
under the obligation of furni&s;hing the city with bread.</P>
<P>The number of the inhabitants of Barcelona, is made to amount to one hundred and fifty thou&s;and &s;ouls, and tho&s;e of Barceloneta to ten thou&s;and. But although trade and population have increa&s;ed &s;urpri&s;ingly in the cour&s;e of a few years, I doubt there is &s;ome exagge|ration in this reckoning.</P>
<P>The great export commerce con&s;i&s;ts in wine, bran|dies, Salt, and oil, which are mo&s;tly taken in by for|eign &s;hips at the little ports and roads along the coa&s;t, and not brought to be &s;hipped off at the capital.</P>
<P>There are mines of lead, iron, and coal, in the moun|tains, but they are ill wrought, and turn to poor ac|count. The manufactures are of more importance. Barcelona &s;upplies Spain with mo&s;t of the cloathing and arms for the troops. This branch of bu&s;ine&s;s is carried on with much intelligence. They can equip a battalion of &s;ix hundred men completely in a week.</P>
<P>A great trade is driven in &s;ilk handkerchiefs and &s;tockings; in woollens of various qualities: in &s;ilk and thread lace; in fire arms. The gun-barrels of Barcelona are much e&s;teemed, and co&s;t from four to twenty guineas; but about five is the real value; all above is paid for fancy and ornament. They are made out of the old &s;hoes of mules. Several manufactures of printed linens are e&s;tabli&s;hed here, but have not yet ar|rived
<PB N="174" REF="031692_0497_0FEE2217B241E010">
at any great elegance of de&s;ign or liveline&s;s of co|lour.</P>
<P>The imports are, be&s;ides corn, about eighty thou|&s;and hundred weight of Newfoundland cod, which pays three per&s;ettas per hundred-weight duty, and &s;ells upon an average at a guinea; beans from Holland for the poor people, and an inferior &s;ort from Africa for the mules; Engli&s;h bale goods, and many foreign arti|cles of nece&s;&s;ity or luxury. Hou&s;e-rent and living are dear; provi&s;ions but indifferent. The fi&s;h is flabby and in&s;ipid; the meat poor, but the vegetables are ex|cellent, e&s;pecially brocoli and cauliflower. I believe their meet and fi&s;h are much better in &s;ummer than at this &s;ea&s;on of the year.</P>
<P>The devotion of the Catalonians &s;eems to be pretty much upon a par with that of their neighbours in the &s;outhern provinces of France, and, I am told, much le&s;s ardent than we &s;hall find it as we advance into Spain; but they &s;till abound with &s;trange practices of religion and local wor&s;hip. One very odd idea of theirs is, that on the fir&s;t of November, the eve of All-Souls, they run about from hou&s;e to hou&s;e to eat che&s;nuts, believing that for every che&s;nut they &s;wallow, with pro|per faith and unction, they &s;hall deliver a Soul out of purgatory.</P>
<P>The influx of foreigners, increa&s;e of commerce, and protection granted to the liberal arts begin to open the
<PB N="175" REF="031692_0498_0FEE22193A7FEBF0">
under&s;tanding of this people, who have made great &s;trides of late towards &s;en&s;e and philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>There are now but one or two churches at mo&s;t in each city, that are allowed the privilege of protecting offenders; and murderers are excluded from the be|nefit of the &s;anctuary. The proceedings of the inqui&s;ition are grown very mild. If any per&s;on leads a &s;canda|lous life, or allows his tongue unwarrantable liberties, he is &s;ummoned by the holy office and privately ad|moni&s;hed; in ca&s;e of non-amendment, he is commit|ted to pri&s;on. Once a year you mu&s;t an&s;wer to that tribunal for the orthodoxy of your family, even of eve|ry &s;ervant, or they mu&s;t quit the country. But the fo|reign Prote&s;tant hou&s;es are pa&s;&s;ed over unnoticed. A|void talking on religion, and with a little di&s;cretion you may live here in what manner you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Every Jew that lands in Spain mu&s;t declare him&s;elf to be &s;uch at the Inqui&s;ition; which immediately ap|points a familiar to attend him all the time he &s;tays a|&s;hore, to whom he pays a pi&s;tole a day: Were he to neglect giving this information, he would be liable to be &s;eized. Yet I have been a&s;&s;ured by per&s;ons of un|doubted credit, that a Jew may travel incognito from Perpignan to Li&s;bon, and &s;leep every night at the hou&s;e of a Jew, being recommended from one to another; and that you may take it for granted, that wherever you &s;ee a hou&s;e remarkably decked out with images,

<HEAD>SECT. LXXXIII. OF THE FLOCKS ON THE PYRENEAN MOUNTAINS.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 10th of July, 1787, we left Bagnere de Lu|chon, and cro&s;&s;ed the mountains to Vielle, the fir&s;t town on the Spani&s;h &s;ide. The Pyrenees are &s;o great an ob|ject of examination, in whatever light they are con&s;id|ered, but e&s;pecially in that of agriculture, that it would be adding a great deal too much to the length of this paper to &s;peak of them here; I &s;hall on another occa|&s;ion be particular in de&s;cribing the hu&s;bandry practi&s;|ed in them, and at pre&s;ent &s;top no longer than to men|tion the pa&s;turage of Catalonian &s;heep in them. By a little detour out of our direct road, and by pa&s;&s;ing Ho&s;|pital, which is the name of a &s;olitary wretched inn, we gained the hights, but free from &s;now, which the Spaniards hire of the French for the pa&s;turage of their flocks. I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that a con&s;iderable part of the
<PB N="177" REF="031692_0500_0FEE2221D544DEB8">
mountains belong in property to the communities of the re&s;pective pari&s;hes, and are di&s;po&s;ed of by what we &s;hould call the Ve&s;try. They hire a very con&s;idera|ble range of many miles. The French mountains, on which they pa&s;ture, are four hours di&s;tant from Bagnere de Luchon, and belong to that town. Tho&s;e hours are more than twenty Engli&s;h miles, and are the mo&s;t di&s;tant part of the pari&s;h. To arrive at them we fol|lowed the river Pique, which upon the maps is &s;ome|times called the Ne&s;te. The whole way it runs in a torrent, and falls in ca&s;cades of many &s;tories, formed either by large pieces of rock, or by trees carried down and &s;topped by &s;tones. The current, in proce&s;s of ages, has worn it&s;elf deep glens to pa&s;s through, at the bot|tom of which the tumbling of the water is heard, but can be &s;een only at breaks in the wood, which hang over and darken the &s;cene. The road, as it is called, pa&s;&s;es generally by the river, but hangs, if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion, like a &s;helf on the mountain &s;ide, and is truly dreadful to the inhabitants of plains, from being broken by gullies, and &s;loping on the edges of preci|pices. It is, however, pa&s;&s;able by mules, and by the hor&s;es of the mountains. The vale grows &s;o narrow at la&s;t, that it is not above an hundred yards wide in &s;ome places. The general &s;cene at la&s;t has little wood.</P>
<P>The mountains on the &s;outh &s;ide fini&s;h in a pyra|midical
<PB N="178" REF="031692_0501_0FEE22235BD0C9E0">
rock of micaceous &s;chi&s;tus, which is con&s;tant|ly tumbling into the plain, from the attacks of the fro&s;t, and the melting of the &s;nows, the &s;lope to the river being &s;pread with fragments. We met here with pieces of lead ore and mangane&s;e.</P>
<P>On the nothern ridge, bearing to the We&s;t, are the pa&s;tures of the Spani&s;h flocks. This ridge is not, how|ever, the whole. There are two other mountains, quite in a different &s;ituation, and the &s;heep travel from one to another, as the pa&s;turage is &s;hort or plentiful. I examined the &s;oil of the&s;e mountain pa&s;tures, and found it in general &s;tony; what in the We&s;t of En|gland would be called a <HI>&s;tone bra&s;h,</HI> with &s;ome mixture of loam, and in a few places a little peaty. The plants are many of them untouched by the &s;heep. Many ferns, narci&s;&s;us, violets, and the narrow-leaved plan|tain, were eaten, as may be &s;uppo&s;ed, clo&s;e. I looked for trefoils, but found &s;carcely any. It was very ap|parent, that &s;oil and peculiarity of herbage had little to do in rendering the&s;e heights proper for &s;heep. In the nothern parts of Europe, the tops of mountains half the height of the&s;e, (for we were above &s;now in July) are bogs.

&s;heep. The flock is brought every night to one &s;pot, which is &s;ituated at the end of the valley on the river I have mentioned, and near the port or pa&s;&s;age of Pica|da. It is a level &s;pot &s;heltered from all winds. The &s;oil is eight or nine inches deep of old dung, not at all inclo&s;ed; and from the freedom from wood all around it, &s;eems to be cho&s;en partly for &s;afety again&s;t wolves and bears. Near it is a very large &s;tone, or rather rock, fallen from the mountain. This the &s;hephards have taken for a &s;helter, and have built a hut again&s;t it. Their beds are &s;heep-&s;kins, and their doors &s;o &s;mall that they crawl in. I &s;aw no place for fire, but they have it, &s;ince they dre&s;s here the fle&s;h of their &s;heep, and in the night &s;ometimes keep off the bears, by whirling fire-brands. Four of them, belonging to the flock mentioned above, lie here. We viewed their flock very carefully, and by means of our guide and interpreter, made &s;ome inquiries of the &s;hepherds, which they an&s;wered readily, and very civily. A Spaniard at Vena&s;que, a city in the Pyrenees, gives &s;ix hundred livres French (the livre is ten pence halfpen|ny Engli&s;h) a year, for the pa&s;turage of this flock of two thou&s;and &s;heep. In the winter he &s;ends them into the lower parts of Catalonia, a journey of twelve or thirteen days, and when the &s;now is melted enough in the &s;pring, they are conducted back again. They are the whole year kept in motion, and moving from &s;pot
<PB N="180" REF="031692_0503_0FEE222C088D83A0">
to &s;pot, which is owing to the great range they every where have of pa&s;ture. They are always in the open air, never hou&s;ed or under cover, and never ta&s;te of any food, but what they can find on the hills.</P>
<P>Four &s;hepherds, and from four to &s;ix large Spani&s;h dogs have the care of this flock. The latter are in France called of the Pyrenees breed. They are black and white, of the &s;ize of a large wolf, a large head and neck, armed with collars &s;tuck with iron &s;pikes. No wolf can &s;tand again&s;t them; but bears are more potent adver&s;aries. If a bear can reach a tree he is &s;afe. He ri&s;es on his hind legs, with his back to the tree, and &s;ets the dogs at defiance. In the night the &s;hepherds rely entirely on their dogs, but on hearing them bark are ready with fire-arms, as the dogs rarely bark if a bear is not at hand. I was &s;urpri&s;ed to find that they are fed only with bread and milk. The head &s;hepherd is paid one hundred and twenty livers a year wages and bread; the others eighty livers and bread. But they are allowed to keep goats, of which they have many, which they milk every day. Their food is milk and bread, except the fle&s;h of &s;uch &s;heep or lambs as accidents give them. The head &s;hepherd keeps on the mountain top, on an elevated &s;pot, from whence he can the better &s;ee around, while the flock tra|ver&s;es the declivities. In doing this the &s;heep are ex|po&s;ed to great danger in places that are &s;tony; for &s;ome
<PB N="181" REF="031692_0504_0FEE222D8FBB9680">
of them, e&s;pecially the goats, by walking among the rocks, move the &s;tones, which rolling down the hills, acquire an accelerated force enough to nock a man down; and &s;heep are often killed by them. Yet we &s;aw how alert they were to avoid &s;uch &s;tones, and cau|tiou&s;ly on their guard again&s;t them. We examined the &s;heep attentively. They are in general polled, but &s;ome have horns; which in the rams turns backward behind the ears, and project half a circle farwards; the ewes horns turn al&s;o behind the ears, but do not project: the legs white or reddi&s;h; &s;peckled faces, &s;ome white, &s;ome reddi&s;h: they would weigh, fat, I rekon, on an average, from fifteen to eighteen pounds a quarter. There are a few black &s;heep among them; and &s;ome with a very little tuft of wool on their fore|heads. On the whole they re&s;emble tho&s;e on the South Downs. Their legs are as &s;hort as tho&s;e of that breed; a point which merits ob&s;ervation, as they travel &s;o much and &s;o well.</P>
<P>Having &s;atisfied our&s;elves with our examination of this flock, we returned to the direct road for Vielle, which al&s;o leads to one of the mo&s;t woody regions of the Pyrenees, and at the &s;ame time the mo&s;t romantic. The road is &s;o bad that no hor&s;e but tho&s;e of the moun|tains could pa&s;s it; but our mules trod &s;ecurely amid&s;t rolling &s;tones on the edges of precipices of a tremen|dous depth; but &s;ure-footed as they are, they are not

free from &s;tumbling; and when they happen to trip a little in tho&s;e &s;ituations, they electrify their riders in a manner not altogether &s;o plea&s;ant as Mr. Wal|ker. The&s;e mountains are chiefly rocks of micace|ous &s;chi&s;tus, but there are large detached fragments of granite.</P>
<P>We pa&s;s the frontier line which divides France and Spain; and ri&s;ing on the mountains, we &s;ee the Spani&s;h valley of Aran, with the river Garonne winding through it in a beautiful manner. The town of Bo|&s;o&s;te is at the foot of the mountains, where is the Spa|ni&s;h cu&s;tom-hou&s;e. Mules imported into Spain pay here &s;ixteen livers. A four year old hor&s;e the &s;ame. A &s;ix year old one thirteen ditto. An ox five; and a &s;heep one and a half &s;ol. This vale of Aran is richly cultivated, and without any fallows. Nothing &s;carcely can be finer than the view of the valley from heights &s;o great as to render the mo&s;t common objects intere&s;t|ing. The road leads under trees, who&s;e arching boughs pre&s;ent at every ten paces new land&s;capes. The woods here are thick, and pre&s;ent fine ma&s;&s;es of &s;hade; the rocks large, and every outline bold: and the ver|dant vale that is &s;pread far below at your feet, has all the features of beauty, in contra&s;t with the &s;ublimity of the &s;urrounding mountains.</P>
<P>We de&s;cend into this vale, and bait at our fir&s;t Spani&s;h inn. No hay, no corn, no meat, no windows;
<PB N="183" REF="031692_0506_0FEE2238081F21D0">
but cheap eggs and bread, and &s;ome trout for fifteen &s;ous. (Seven pence halfpenny Engli&s;h.)</P>
<P>We followed from hence the Garonne, which is al|ready a fine river, but very rapid. On it they float many trees to their &s;aw-mills, to cut into boards. We &s;aw many at work. The vale is narrow, but the Hills to the left are cultivated high up. There are no fal|lows. They have little wheat, but a great deal of rye; and much better barley than in the French mountains. In&s;tead of fallows they have maize and millet, and ma|ny more potatoes than in the French mountains. They have al&s;o French beans, and a little hemp. We &s;aw two fields of vetches and &s;quare pea&s;e. The &s;mall potatoes they give to their pigs, which do very well with them; and the leaves to their cows, but a&s;&s;ert that they refu&s;e the roots. Buck-wheat al&s;o takes the place of fallow. Many crops of it were good, and &s;ome as fine as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The whole valley of Aran is well cultivated and highly peopled. It is eight hours long, or about for|ty miles Engli&s;h, and has in it thirty-two villages. The&s;e villages, or rather little towns, have a very pretty ap|pearance, the walls being well built, and the hou&s;es are well &s;lated. But on entering the&s;e towns the &s;pectacle changes at once. We found them the abodes of pov|erty and wretchedne&s;s; not one window of gla&s;s to be &s;een in a whole town; &s;carcely any chimnies, both
<PB N="184" REF="031692_0507_0FEE22398F8F98C8">
ground floor and the chimnies vomiting the &s;moke out of the windows.</P>
<P>We arrive at Vielle, the capitol of this valley, and the pa&s;&s;age from this part of France to Barcelona; a circum&s;tance which has given &s;ome trifling re&s;ources to it. We were informed here, that we could not go into Spain without a pa&s;&s;port; we therefore waited on the governor, who pre&s;ides over the whole valley and its thirty-two towns. His hou&s;e was the only one we had &s;een with gla&s;s windows. He is a lieutenant colo|nel, and knight of Calatrava. In his ante-room was the king's picture, with a canopy of &s;tate over it. The governor received us with the Spani&s;h formality, and a&s;&s;ured us that a few months ago, there was an order <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o &s;end every foreigner, found without a pa&s;&s;port, to the troops. Such orders &s;how pretty well the number of foreigners here. On each &s;ide of his bed was a brace of pi&s;tols, and a crucifix in the middle. We did not a&s;k in which he put the mo&s;t confidence.</P>
<P>We made enquiries concerning the agriculture. They have no farmers. Every one cultivates his own land, which is never fallowed. They have no &s;pecies of manufactures, but &s;pinning and weaving for the private u&s;e of every family.</P>
<P>The mountains belong, as in the French Pyrenees, to the pari&s;hes. Each inhabitant has a right to cut what wood he plea&s;es for fuel and repairs, in the
<PB N="185" REF="031692_0508_0FEE223B162C9320">
woods a&s;&s;igned for that purpo&s;e. Others are let by lea&s;e at public auction for the benefit of the pari&s;h, the trees to be cut being marked; and in general, the po|lice of their woods is better than on the French &s;ide. When woods are cut they are pre&s;erved. Their moun|tain pa&s;tures not u&s;ed by them&s;elves, they let to the owners of large flocks, who bring them from the low|er part of Catalonia. The&s;e flocks ri&s;e to four thou|&s;and &s;heep, the rent, in general, being from five to &s;e|ven &s;ous a head for the &s;ummer food. Every inhabi|tant po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es cattle, which he keeps in the common mountains in what quantity he plea&s;es; but others, who do not belong to the pari&s;h, pay five to &s;even &s;ous a head for the &s;heep, and ten &s;ous for a cow; which di&s;proportion they explain, by &s;aying, that &s;heep mu&s;t have a much greater range. In &s;ummer they make chee&s;e, which we ta&s;ted and found good. In winter their cattle are kept at home, and their cows fed on buck-wheat &s;traw, which they a&s;&s;ert to be good food; al&s;o that of maize and millet, and a little hay; mo&s;t of it being a&s;&s;igned to their mules. They have good &s;heep, but all are &s;ent to Sarago&s;a or Barcelona. They have &s;carce any oxen; what few they kill, they &s;alt for winter.</P>
<P>Taxes are light; the whole which the town is a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at being only two thou&s;and &s;even-hundred livers, which they pay by the rent of their woods and pa&s;tures
<PB N="186" REF="031692_0509_0FEE224236B68010">
let. When the principles of a government tend to de&s;poti&s;m and the very pictures of kings are treated with reverence, the con&s;equence is light taxation. The only effectual means of in&s;uring a great revenue, is to extend the principles and the exerci&s;e of liberty. The change is, and ever will be, as much for the benefit of the prince as of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>At Bagnere de Luchon we were told that the inn at Vielle was good. We found the lower floor a &s;table, from which we mounted to a black kitchen, and through that to a baking-room with a large batch of loaves making for an oven which was heating to receive them. In this room were two beds for all the travel|lers that might come. If too numerous, &s;traw is &s;pread on the floor, and you may re&s;t as you can. There was no gla&s;s in the windows. One of the beds was occupi|ed, &s;o that my companion &s;lept on a table. The hou&s;e, however, afforded eggs for an omelet, good bread, thick wine, brandy, and fowls, killed after we arrived. The people were very dirty, but civil.</P>
<P>On the eleventh of July we reached Scullo. The inn was &s;o bad, that our guide would not permit us to enter it, but conducted us to the hou&s;e of the C&uacute;re. A &s;cene followed &s;o new to Engli&s;h eyes, that we could not refrain from laughing very heartily. Not a pane of gla&s;s in the whole town, but our reverend ho&s;t had a chimney in his kitchen. He ran to the river to catch
<PB N="187" REF="031692_0510_0FEE2243C27A6A28">
trout. A man brought us &s;ome chickings, which were put to death on the &s;pot. For light they kindled &s;plinters of pitch-pine, and two merry wenches, with three or four men collected to &s;tare at us, as well as we at them, were pre&s;ently bu&s;y in &s;atisfying our hunger. They gave us red wine &s;o dreadfully putrid from the borachio, that I could not touch it; and bran|dy, but poi&s;oned with ani&s;eed. Then a bottle of ex|cellent rich white wine was produced, re&s;embling good mountain, and all was well. But when we came to exa|mine our beds there was only one. My friend would again do the honours, and in&s;i&s;ted on my taking it. He made his on a table; and what with bugs, fleas, rats, and mice, &s;lept not. I was not attacked; and though the bed and a pavement might be ranked in the &s;ame cla&s;s of &s;oftne&s;s, fatigue converted it to down. This town and its inhabitants are, to the eye, equally wretched. The &s;moke-holes in&s;tead of chimneys; the total want of gla&s;s windows, the chearfulne&s;s of which, to the eye, is known only by the want; the dre&s;s of the women, all in black, with cloth of the &s;ame co|lour about their heads, and hanging half down their backs; no &s;hoes; no &s;tockings; the effect upon the whole di&s;mal; &s;avage as the rocks and mountains.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. LXXXIV. OF MADRID. A. D. 1778.</HEAD>
<P>IN the afternoons, we &s;pent our time in vi&s;iting the mo&s;t remarkable edifices of this city. If you except the royal palaces, there are few buildings worthy of atten|tion, nor do I believe there is in Europe a capital that has &s;o little to &s;how as Madrid. Having never been the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, it has of cour&s;e no cathedral, nor indeed any church, that di&s;tingui&s;hes it&s;elf much from the common herd of pari&s;hes and convents. Allow|ing &s;ome few exceptions, I think I may &s;afely pro|nounce the outward artchitecture of them all to be bar|barous, and their manner of ornamenting the in&s;ide as bad as that of the wor&s;t ages. Mo&s;t of them were e|rected or retouched during the term of years that elap&s;|ed between the middle of the &s;eventeeth century and the year 1759, a period in the hi&s;tory of Spain when all arts and &s;ciences were fallen to the lowe&s;t ebb; the effects of the degeneracy of manners, the want of pub|lic &s;pirit, and the di&s;order and weakne&s;s of a decaying monarchy. The&s;e vices in the political &s;y&s;tem under the three la&s;t princes of the Au&s;trian line, could not be removed immediately on the acce&s;&s;ion of another family. The wars that &s;hook the very foundations
<PB N="189" REF="031692_0512_0FEE224C62EEF288">
of their throne for the fir&s;t ten years of this century, kept all polite arts groveling in the du&s;t; and when they ventured to rai&s;e their heads again, and court the favour of the &s;overeign, there &s;eems to have been a to|tal want of able profe&s;&s;ors to &s;econd their efforts, and a&s;&s;i&s;t them in returning to the paths of good &s;en&s;e and true ta&s;te.</P>
<P>No mad architect ever dreamed of a di&s;tortion of members &s;o capricious, of a twi&s;t of pillars, cornices, or pediments, &s;o wild and fanta&s;tic, but what a real &s;ample of it may be produced in &s;ome or other of the churches of Madrid. They are all &s;mall, and poor in marbles as well as pictures. Their alters are piles of wooden ornaments, heaped up to the ceiling, and &s;tuck full of wax lights, which more than once have &s;et fire to the whole church.</P>
<P>The convents, which may be &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s a good collection of pictures, are tho&s;e of Saint Pa&s;qual, and of the bare-footed Carmelite nuns. The former has a fine Titian, a capital Guerchino, and many other pieces by e&s;teemed Italian ma&s;ters. In the &s;acri&s;ty of the latter, is a numerous collection of paintings by va|rious hands, many of which are of &s;uperior merit. The tombs of Ferdinand the Sixth, and of his queen Babara, in the church of the Vi&s;itation, are almo&s;t the only &s;e|pulchral monuments of any con&s;equence.</P>
<P>The royal palace is all of white &s;tone. Each of the
<PB N="190" REF="031692_0513_0FEE224DEA7CCCF0">
fronts being four hundred and &s;eventy feet in length, by one hundred high, this pile towers over all the coun|try, where nothing intercepts the view for many miles. The entrances and ground-floor appear more like tho&s;e of &s;ome mighty fortre&s;s, than of the peaceable habitation of a powerful monarch, an hundred leagues removed from his frontiers. The range of large glazed arches round the inner court, re&s;embles the in&s;ide of a manu|factory. This is the more unpardonable, as they had at no great di&s;tance, in the Alcazar of Toledo, as ele|gant a colonnade as the nice&s;t critic could de&s;ire. The beautiful circular court of Granada might have &s;ugge&s;ted noble ideas to the architect; but perhaps at that time the very exi&s;tence of &s;uch a thing was a &s;e|cret at Madrid.</P>
<P>The &s;tair-ca&s;e was meant to be double, but it was afterwards judged more convenient to &s;hut up one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ight, as the remaining half an&s;wered every purpo&s;e. At the foot of the &s;tairs I &s;hall leave all my &s;pleen, and prepare my&s;elf with unfeigned &s;atisfaction to de&s;cribe to you the beauty and grandeur of the upper apart|ments.</P>
<P>I know no place in Europe fitted up with &s;o much true royal magnificence. The riche&s;t marbles are em|ployed with great ta&s;te in forming the cornices and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ocles of the rooms, and the frames of the doors and windows. What enhances the value of the&s;e marbles,
<PB N="191" REF="031692_0514_0FEE224F71EAC730">
is the circum&s;tance of their being all produced in the quarries of Spain, from whence it is the opinion of a learned writer, that ancient Rome was &s;upplied with many of the precious m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">terials that enriched her por|ticoes and temples. At lea&s;t, there is no pre&s;umption in a&s;&s;erting, that the bowels of the earth in Spain con|tain mo&s;t of tho&s;e &s;pecies of marbles, that are to be &s;een in the ruins of the mi&s;tre&s;s of the world, whatever might be the countries from which they were drawn. Porphyry is found near Cordova; the fine&s;t ja&s;per near Aracena; the mountains of Granada furni&s;h a beauti|ful green, tho&s;e of Torto&s;a a variety of brown marbles. Leon and Malaga &s;end alaba&s;ter; Toledo, Talavera, Badajoz, and Murviedro, abound in marbles of differ|ent colours, and mo&s;t parts of the kingdom afford &s;ome &s;pecimen or other of ja&s;per, be&s;ides the amethy&s;t and its radix, for which Spain is celebrated above mo&s;t oth|er countries.</P>
<P>The great audience chamber is one of the riche&s;t I know. The ceiling, painted by Tiepolo, repre&s;ents the triumph of Spain. Round the cornice the ar|ti&s;t has placed allegorical figures of its different pro|vinces di&s;tingui&s;hed by their productions, and attend|ed by &s;everal of their inhabitants in the provincial ha|bit. The&s;e form a mo&s;t uncommon picture, and a cu|rious &s;et of <HI>Co&s;tumi.</HI> The walls are incru&s;tated with beautiful marble, and all around hung with large plates

of looking gla&s;s in rich frames. The manufactory of gla&s;s is at Saint Ildefon&s;o, where they ca&s;t them of a very great &s;ize; but I am told they are apt to turn out much rougher, and fuller of flaws, than tho&s;e made in France.</P>
<P>A collection of pictures, by the greate&s;t ma&s;ters of the art, adorns the walls of the inner apartments; but even this va&s;t fabric does not afford room for all the riches his Catholic Maje&s;ty po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in this branch. The detail and catalogue of a number of paintings, is &s;ure to fatigue a reader who has never &s;een, nor can ever rationally expect to &s;ee them; therefore it is in|cumbent on me to &s;elect only a few of my favourites from my memorandums.</P>
<P>Of the works of Titian, the mo&s;t remarkable are, a bacchanalian woman lying on her back a&s;leep. The liquor has diffu&s;ed a glow over her beautiful face, and her body is divinely hand&s;ome. One of the greate&s;t painters of the age has often declared, he never pa&s;&s;ed before this picture without being &s;truck with admira|tion; &s;ome boys playing, full of grace, and a charming variety of attitudes.</P>
<P>Rubens&mdash;Chri&s;t and St. John Bapti&s;t, lovely chil|dren. A prie&s;t on hor&s;eback, carrying the viaticum to a &s;ick per&s;on, accompanied by Rodolph earl of Hap&s;burgh, one of the ma&s;ter-pieces of his pencil.</P>

<P>In the &s;hallow vale between the Retiro and the town, which has not the lea&s;t &s;uburb of any kind be|longing to it, the pre&s;ent King has fini&s;hed the Prado, which in a few years, provided they manage the trees properly, will be one of the fine&s;t walks in the world. Its length and breadth are great, the avenues drawn in an intelligent, noble &s;tyle, the foot-paths wide and neat, the iron railing and &s;tone &s;eats done in a grand expen&s;ive manner. All the coaches of Madrid drive in the ring here; and though the ab&s;ence of the court le&s;&s;ens the appearance more than two thirds, yet la&s;t night I counted two hundred carriages following each other. On the declivity of the Retiro, they mean to plant a botanical garden.</P>
<P>The view from this walk is, as it &s;hould be, confi|ned; for the winds are &s;o &s;harp and boi&s;terous, and the land&s;cape &s;o horrid all round the city, that no place of public re&s;ort could be comfortable, unle&s;s it were, like this, &s;hut in from all di&s;tant views, and
<PB N="194" REF="031692_0517_0FEE225D335B8D70">
&s;heltered by the hills from the bla&s;ts that &s;weep over the highlands of Ca&s;tile.</P>
<P>To the we&s;t, it has the town, the three principal &s;treets of which terminate in the Prado. The&s;e are three noble openings, excellently paved, and clean e|ven to a nicety; indeed &s;o are mo&s;t of the &s;treets of Madrid &s;ince the edict for paving and cleaning them. The foreigners that re&s;ided here before that time, &s;hud|der at the very recollection of its former filth.</P>
<P>Some of the natives regret the old &s;tinks and na&s;ti|ne&s;s; as they pretend that the air of Madrid is &s;o &s;ub|tle as to require a proper mixture of gro&s;&s;er effluvia, to prevent its pernicious effects upon the con&s;titution. The extremes of cold and heat are a&s;toni&s;hing in this place, and the winds &s;o &s;earching, that all the Spaniards wear leathern under wai&s;tcoats, to pre&s;erve their che&s;ts; for they pervade every other kind of clothing. In &s;ummer the du&s;t is intolerable.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. LXXXV. OF THE ROYAL FAMILY OF SPAIN.</HEAD>
<P>WE have ju&s;t fini&s;hed our round of pre&s;entations, which in &s;o numerous a royal family, is a work of more days than one. As I know you expect a minute ac|count of each of tho&s;e that compo&s;e it, I am &s;orry I am incapable of &s;atisfying your curio&s;ity, in as ample a manner as I could wi&s;h. You &s;hall have a de&s;crip|tion of their per&s;ons, and as much of their characters as I have learned from well-informed people, in who&s;e judgment I can confide. I beg you will con&s;ider how hard it is to di&s;cern the true character of the great, as your intelligence can only flow to you through the &s;u&s;|picious channel of many jarring pa&s;&s;ions and intere&s;ts. It is impo&s;&s;ible for a &s;tranger to &s;eize a good likene&s;s in &s;o &s;hort a time, and to tran&s;mit to others a faithful repre|&s;entation of a prince that does not admit him to a fa|miliar intercour&s;e.</P>
<P>I don't know but &s;overeigns are the mo&s;t difficult characters to define in a whoe nation; for all princes appear pretty nearly alike. Their mode of life is uni|form. By &s;eeing none but inferiors about them, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a great indifference in their manner, and &s;eldom
<PB N="196" REF="031692_0519_0FEE2260451E39F8">
betray in their countenance any of tho&s;e &s;trong emo|tions that mark the various feelings of men obliged to bu&s;tle through the world. Their pa&s;&s;ions lack the re|li&s;h which ari&s;es from delays and difficulties. What the French call <HI>Ennui,</HI> weari&s;omene&s;s is, methinks, the grand malady of princes, and therefore amu&s;ement is their main pur&s;uit in life.</P>
<P>In the prince&s;s of the hou&s;e of Bourbon, the pa&s;&s;ion of fowling predominates: yet in the Spani&s;h royal fa|mily, there are &s;ome who toil at the gun with more reluctance than the farmer's boy does at the plough; have a ta&s;te for arts and &s;ciences, and wi&s;h for nothing more than to be freed from the obligation of following the diver&s;ion.</P>
<P>The ceremony of pre&s;entation is performed as the king ri&s;es from table. Charles the Third is a much better looking man than mo&s;t of his pictures make him. He has a good natured laughing eye. The lower part of his face, by being expo&s;ed to all weathers, is be|come of a deep copper colour. What his hat covers is fair, as he naturally has a good &s;kin. In &s;tature he is rather &s;hort, thickly built about the legs and thighs, and narrow in the &s;houlders. His dre&s;s &s;eldom varies from a large hat, a plain grey Segovia frock, a buff wai&s;tcoat, a &s;mall dagger, black breeches, and wor&s;ted &s;tockings. His pockets are always &s;tuffed with knives, gloves, and &s;hooting tackle. On Gala days a fine &s;uit
<PB N="197" REF="031692_0520_0FEE2267539590A8">
is hung upon his &s;houlders, but as he has an eye to his afternoon &s;port, and is a great oeconomi&s;t of his time, the black breeches are worn to all coats. I believe there are but three days in the whole year that he &s;pends without going out a-&s;hooting, and tho&s;e are no|ted with the blacke&s;t mark in the callender. Were they to occur often, his health would be in danger, and an accident that was to confine him to the hou&s;e, would infallibly bring on a fit of illne&s;s. No &s;torm, heat, cold, or wet, can keep him at home; and when he hears of a wolf being &s;een, di&s;tance is counted for nothing. He would drive over half the kingdom rath|er than mi&s;s an opportunity of firing upon that favour|ite game.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides a mo&s;t numerous retinue of per&s;ons belong|ing to the hunting e&s;tabli&s;hment, &s;everal times a year, all the idle fellows in and about Madrid are hired to beat the country, and drive the wild boars, deer, and hares, into a ring, where they pa&s;s before the royal fa|mily. A very large annual &s;um is di&s;tributed among the proprietors of land about the capital, and near the country palaces, by way of indemnification for the damage done to the corn. I was a&s;&s;ured that it co&s;t &s;eventy thou&s;and pounds &s;terling for the environs of Madrid, and thirty thou&s;and for tho&s;e o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Saint Ilde|fon&s;o. In order to be entitled to this reimbur&s;ement, the farmers &s;catter ju&s;t as much &s;eed-corn over their
<PB N="198" REF="031692_0521_0FEE2268D988E938">
grounds, as will grow up into &s;omething like a crop; but they do not always give them&s;elves the trouble of getting in the &s;canty harve&s;t, being &s;ufficiently paid for their labour by the royal bounty.</P>
<P>Being naturally of an even phlegmatic temper, the king is &s;ure to &s;ee events on their favourable &s;ide only; and whenever he has determined in his own mind, that a mea&s;ure is proper to be per&s;ued, he is an utter enemy to alteration. As far as I can judge, by com|paring the different accounts I have had, he is a man of the &s;tricte&s;t probity, incapable of adopting any &s;cheme, unle&s;s he is perfectly &s;atisfied in his con&s;cience that it is ju&s;t and honourable;&mdash;of &s;uch immovable features, that the mo&s;t fortunate or the mo&s;t di&s;a&s;trious occurren|ces, are alike unable to create the &s;malle&s;t variation in them;&mdash;rigid in his morals, and &s;trenuou&s;ly attached to his religion; but he does not &s;uffer his devotion to lay him open to the enterprizes of the court of Rome, or the encroachments of his own clergy; on the contrary, they have frequently met with rougher u&s;age at his hands than they might have expected from a freethinker.</P>
<P>The regularity of his own life renders him very &s;trict about the conduct of his children, whom he obliges to be out fi&s;hing or &s;hooting as long as he is ab&s;ent on the &s;ame bu&s;ine&s;s. This he does to prevent their hav|ing time or opportunity to harbour bad thoughts; and truly I believe he goes out &s;o con&s;tantly him&s;elf, in or|der
<PB N="199" REF="031692_0522_0FEE226A60FF24C0">
to keep down the vigour of his own con&s;titution. He &s;eldom addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to any young men of his court; but delights in conver&s;ing and joking with el|derly per&s;ons, and &s;uch as are of his own age, e&s;pecial|ly monks and friars. He is very partial to Naples, and always &s;peaks of that country with great feeling.</P>
<P>Since his acce&s;&s;ion, many great works have been completed; noble roads made to all the palaces round the metropolis; &s;everal others undertaken in more re|mote provinces. He has fini&s;hed the palace at Ma|drid, and added con&s;iderably to tho&s;e of the Prado and Aranjuez; built new towns at Aranjuez, and E&s;curi|al, and St. Ildefon&s;o; and planted a great deal at A|ranjuez. The Marquis of Grimaldi has the merit of having &s;ugge&s;ted and conducted mo&s;t of the&s;e improve|ments, and of having urged on the king, who although he has naturally no great reli&s;h for the arts, thinks it the duty of a &s;overeign to encourage them.</P>
<P>The Prince of A&s;turias is of an athletic make, his countenance rather &s;evere, and his voice har&s;h. He &s;eemed in a great hurry to get away from us; but the prince&s;s &s;tayed chatting a great while, She is not hand&s;ome, being very &s;ickly, but &s;eems lively and gen|teelly &s;haped, with a very fine hand and arm. If &s;he lives to be a queen, I dare &s;ay &s;he will render this court a very gay one; for &s;he appears to like to go a|broad, and conver&s;e with &s;trangers. When &s;he walks

out, all per&s;ons that have been pre&s;ented, and chance to be in the way, are expected to join her company, and e&s;cort her as long as &s;he thinks proper. Her mildne&s;s and good-nature have &s;oftened much of her hu&s;band's roughne&s;s of manner; and of late he &s;eems to have more plea&s;ure in &s;itting with her in a dome&s;|tic way, than in trudging over the heath in que&s;t of game.</P>
<P>Don Gabriel is a tall well looking man, but timid to exce&s;s. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es many talents, but his con&s;tant avocations out of doors prevent his applying to &s;tudy as much as he could wi&s;h. I have &s;een &s;ome good pictures done by him, and have heard much of his cla&s;|&s;ical learning, and turn for mathematics.</P>
<P>Don Antonio appears to be very well plea&s;ed with the active life of a &s;port&s;man.</P>
<P>The Infanta Maria Jo&s;epha has rea&s;on to envy every country wench &s;he &s;ees roaming at liberty; for con|finement, etiquette, and celibacy, are likely to be her lot during life.</P>
<P>Don Lewis, the king's brother, after having been a cardinal and an archbi&s;hop, is now on the eve of matrimony with a pretty Arragone&s;e girl, whom he took a fancy to la&s;t year, as &s;he was running acro&s;s the fields after a butterfly. As he has made a collection of natural hi&s;tory, the &s;imilarity of ta&s;te made a great impre&s;&s;ion upon him. This wedding, which the king
<PB N="201" REF="031692_0524_0FED3840B6DA5FA8">
has con&s;ented to with reluctance, has produced a total revolution in the marriage-laws of Spain. A new pragmatica or edict is publi&s;hed, to prevent all match|es betwixt per&s;ons of unequal rank and quality. By this decree the old cu&s;tom is abrogated. Heretofore it was out of the power of parents to hinder their chil|dren from marrying whom they liked, and the church interpo&s;ed to oblige them to make a &s;uitable &s;ettlement upon the young couple.</P>
<P>Don Lewis's bride is not to be allowed the title or rank of a prince&s;s of the blood, nor are her children to be deemed qualified to &s;ucceed to the crown. He is to re&s;ide near Talavera, where I make no doubt but he will lead a happy life, as he has a great ta&s;te for mu|&s;ic and natural hi&s;tory. His cabinet already contains a very valuable collection of rarities, e&s;pecially &s;uch as are found in the Spani&s;h dominions. This prince is chearful, humane, affable, and full of plea&s;antry: good qualities that render him the darling of the na|tion.</P>
<P>The king and all the males of his family wear the en&s;igns of a great variety of military orders. On their left brea&s;t is a row of &s;tars like the belt of the con&s;tel|lation of Orion. They are al&s;o decorated with the blue ribband of the French order of the Holy Gho&s;t, and the in&s;ignia of the Burgundian golden fleece. They have be&s;ides the Neapolitan red &s;a&s;h of St. Januarius,

the red cro&s;&s;es of Calatrava, founded in 1158, of St. Jago, dated from 1175, and of Monte&s;a, in&s;tituted in 1317, and the green cro&s;s of Alcantaria, invented in 1176. After all the&s;e badges, comes the blue and white ribband of the Conception of Carlos Tercero, e&s;tabli&s;hed by the pre&s;ent king, on the birth of the late &s;on of the Prince of A&s;turias.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. LXXXVI. CHARACTER OF THE SPANIARDS.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been my con&s;tant &s;tudy, during our tour round Spain, to note down and tran&s;mit to you every peculiarity that might throw light upon the di&s;tinctive turn and genius of the nation. Experience has taught me to look upon this method as the be&s;t, and indeed the only &s;ure guide to the knowledge of a people; but at the &s;ame time has made me &s;en&s;ible how imperfect an idea is to be acquired by a tran&s;itory view, in a progre&s;s of a few months. Cu&s;toms that &s;truck me at fir&s;t as unaccountable, from my ignorance of mo|tives and &s;ituations, have frequently &s;ince appeared to
<PB N="203" REF="031692_0526_0FED3846A22A9CD0">
me not only proper and rational, but ab&s;olutely &s;o much in the common cour&s;e of things, that I have wondered how I came to put them down as extraordi|nary.</P>
<P>The mi&s;takes I have found my&s;elf guilty of in &s;eve|ral little remarks made, in the fir&s;t part of my journey, have rendered me very cautious of deciding upon mat|ters, where I could not come at a knowledge of their cau&s;es. I therefore very early learned to mi&s;tru&s;t my &s;en&s;es, and applied where I expected to have my doubts re&s;olved, and the rea&s;ons of modes and u&s;ages explain|ed to me.</P>
<P>Accordingly I omitted no opportunity of drawing information from the natives of all ranks; from &s;tran|gers long e&s;tabli&s;hed in Spain, and from tho&s;e who, hav|ing re&s;ided but a few years there, were more likely to be &s;en&s;ible of the &s;ingularities of the national di&s;po|&s;ition. I cannot &s;ay my endeavours have been crown|ed with much &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Were I to draw the picture of the Spaniards from the manifold &s;ketches traced by their countrymen, eve|ry province in the kingdom would in its turn appear a Paradi&s;e, and a Pandoemonium, a &s;eat of holy &s;pirits, and a receptacle of malicious devils. The mo&s;t con|tradictory accounts, enforced by the mo&s;t po&s;itive a&s;&s;e|verations, have been repeatedly given me of the &s;ame places. I have often found the virtue one province
<PB N="204" REF="031692_0527_0FEE75D400E69B28">
prides it&s;elf in, as being the &s;pecific mark of its inhabitants, not only refu&s;ed them by a neighbouring country, but the very oppo&s;ite vice impo&s;ed upon them as their cha|racteri&s;tic. The Engli&s;h, French, and other foreign|ers, living in Spain, are in general but indifferently qualified to decide upon the&s;e matters. As long as they retain the prejudices they brought from home a|gain&s;t every thing that cla&s;hes with their native cu&s;|toms, they are but partial judges; and when once they fall into the ways of the place where commerce has fixed their lot, they become &s;uch thorough paced Span|iards, that they can neither perceive the particularities you &s;peak to them of, nor a&s;&s;ign rea&s;ons for u&s;es that are grown habitual to them.</P>
<P>As I am not a&s;hamed to acknowledge my in&s;uffici|ency, I frankly confe&s;s it is not in my power to give what you may think a &s;atisfactory character of the Spaniards. Were I inclined to flatter my &s;elf-love, I might add, that I do not e&s;teem any of tho&s;e who have already written on the &s;ubject, much better qualified than my&s;elf. What I can venture to &s;ay amounts to very little.</P>
<P>The Catalonians appear to be the mo&s;t active, &s;tirring &s;et of men, the be&s;t calculated for bu&s;ine&s;s, travelling and manufactories. The Valencians are a more &s;ul|len &s;edate race, better adapted to the occupations of hu&s;bandmen, le&s;s eager to change place, and of a much
<PB N="205" REF="031692_0528_0FEE75D6CFB2EBC0">
more timid, &s;u&s;picious ca&s;t of mind than the former. The Andalu&s;ians &s;eem to me the great talkers and rhodomontadoes of Spain. The Ca&s;tillians have a manly frankne&s;s, and le&s;s appearance of cunning and deceit. The new Ca&s;tillians are perhaps the lea&s;t in|du&s;trious of the whole nation; the old Ca&s;tillians are laborious, and retain more of an ancient &s;implicity of manners; both are of a firm, determined &s;pirit. I take the Arragone&s;e to be a mixture of the Ca&s;tillians and Ca|talonians, rather inclining to the former. The Bi&s;cay|ners are acute and diligent, fiery and impatient of controul; more re&s;embling a colony of republicans, than a province of an ab&s;olute monarchy. The Ga|licians are a plodding, pains-taking race of mortals, that roam over Spain in &s;earch of an hardly-earned &s;ub|&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>The li&s;tle&s;s indolence equally dear to the unciviliz|ed &s;avage, and to the degenerate &s;lave of de&s;poti&s;m, is no where more indulged than in Spain. Thou&s;ands of men in all parts of the realm are &s;een to pa&s;s their whole day, wrapped up in a cloak, &s;tanding in rows again&s;t a wall, or dozing under a tree. In total want of every excitement to action, the &s;prings of their intellectual faculties forget to play, their views grow confined within the wretched &s;phere of mere exi&s;tence, and they &s;carce &s;eem to hope or fore&s;ee any thing bet|ter than their pre&s;ent &s;tate of vegetation. They feel
<PB N="206" REF="031692_0529_0FEE75D855386368">
little or no concern for the welfare or glory of a coun|try, where the &s;urface of the earth is engro&s;&s;ed by a few over-grown families, who &s;eldom be&s;tow a thought on the condition of their va&s;&s;als. The poor Spaniard does not work, unle&s;s urged by irre&s;i&s;table want, be|cau&s;e he perceives no advantage accrue from indu&s;try. As his food and raiment are purcha&s;ed at a &s;mall ex|pence, he &s;pends no more time in labour, than is ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for procuring the &s;canty provi&s;ion his ab&s;temiou&s;ne&s;s requires. I have heard a pea&s;ant refu&s;e to run an arrand becau&s;e he had that morn|ing earned as much already as would la&s;t him the day, without putting him&s;elf to any further trouble.</P>
<P>Yet I am convinced that this lazine&s;s is not e&s;&s;enti|ally inherent in the Spani&s;h compo&s;ition. For it is impo&s;&s;ible, without &s;eeing them, to conceive with what eagerne&s;s they per&s;ue any favourite &s;cheme, with what violence their pa&s;&s;ions work upon them, and what vigour and exertion of powers they di&s;play when awakened by a bull-fea&s;t, or the mo&s;t con&s;tant agita|tion of gaming, a vice to which they are &s;uperlatively addicted. Were it again po&s;&s;ible, by an intelligent &s;pirited admini&s;tration, to &s;et before their eyes, in a clear and forcible manner proper incitements to acti|vity and indu&s;try, the Spaniards might yet be rou&s;ed from their lethargy, and led to riches and reputation; but I confe&s;s the ta&s;k is &s;o difficult, that I look upon
<PB N="207" REF="031692_0530_0FEE75D9DCF36468">
it rather as an Utopian idea, than as a revolution like|ly ever to take place.</P>
<P>Their &s;oldiers are brave, and patient of hard&s;hips. Wherever their officers lead them, they will follow without flinching, though it be up to the mouth of a battery of cannon; but unle&s;s the example be given them by their commander, not a &s;tep will they ad|vance.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the Spaniards are hardy; and when once engaged, go through difficulties without murmuring, bear the inclemancies of the &s;ea&s;ons with firmne&s;s, and &s;upport fatigue with amazing per&s;everance. They &s;leep every night in their cloaks on the ground; are &s;paring in diet, perhaps more from a &s;en&s;e of habitual indigence, than from any aver&s;ion to gluttony. When|ever they can riot in the plenty of another man's ta|ble, they will gormandize to acce&s;s, and, not content with eating their fill, will carry off whatever they can &s;tuff into their pockets. I have more than once been a witne&s;s to the pillage of a &s;upper, by the numerous beaux and admirers which the ladies lead after them in triumph, wherever they are invited. They are fond of &s;pices, and &s;carce eat any thing without &s;affron, pimen|to, or garlic. They delight in wine that ta&s;tes &s;trong of the pitched &s;kin, and of oil that has a rank &s;mell and ta&s;te. Indeed, the &s;ame oil feeds their lamp, &s;wims in their pottage, and dre&s;&s;es their &s;allad. In inns the light|ed
<PB N="208" REF="031692_0531_0FEE75DCACBCE950">
lamp is frequently handed down to the table, that each man may take the quantity he chu&s;es. Much tobacco is u&s;ed by them in &s;moaking and chewing. All the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e hot, drying kinds of food, co-operating with the parching qualities of the atmo&s;phere, are a&s;&s;igned as cau&s;es of the &s;pare make of the common people in Spain, where the prie&s;ts and the inn keepers are almo&s;t the only well-fed, portly figures to be met with.</P>
<P>The Spani&s;h is by no means naturally a &s;erious mel|ancholy nation. Mi&s;ery and di&s;content have ca&s;t a gloom over them, increa&s;ed no doubt, by the long habit of di&s;tru&s;t and terror in&s;pired by the inqui&s;ition; yet every village &s;till re&s;ounds with the mu&s;ic of voices and guitars; and their fairs and Sunday wakes are re|markable noi&s;y and riotous. They talk louder, and argue with more vehemence than even the French or Italians, and ge&s;ticulate with equal, if not &s;uperior ea|gerne&s;s. In Catalonia the young men are expert at ball; and every village has its <HI>pelota,</HI> or ground for play|ing at fives; but in the South of Spain I never percei|ved that the inhabitants u&s;ed any particular exerci&s;e. I am told, that in the i&s;land of Majorca they &s;till wield the &s;ling, for which their ance&s;tors, the Baleares, were &s;o much renowned.</P>
<P>Like mo&s;t people of Southern climates, they are dir|ty in their per&s;ons, and overrun with vermin.</P>
<P>As their con&s;titution may be &s;aid to be made up of
<PB N="209" REF="031692_0532_0FEE75DF71B41F00">
the mo&s;t combu&s;tible ingredients, and prone to love in a degree that natives of more northen latitudes can have no idea of, the cu&s;tom of embracing per&s;ons of the other &s;ex, which is u&s;ed on many occa&s;ions by foreign|ers, &s;ets the Spaniards all on fire. They would as &s;oon allow a man to pa&s;s the night in bed with their wives or daughters, as &s;uffer him to give them a ki&s;s.</P>
<P>I was &s;urprized to find them &s;o much more luke|warm in their devotion than I expected; but I will not take upon me to a&s;&s;ert, though I have great rea&s;on to believe it, that there is in Spain as little true moral religion as in any country I ever travelled through, al|though none abounds more with provincial protectors, local Madonnas, and altars celebrated for particular cures and indulgencies. Religion is a topic not to be touched, much le&s;s handled with any dgree of curio&s;ity, in the dominions of &s;o tremendous a tribunal as the Inqui&s;ition. From what little I &s;aw, I am apt to &s;u&s;|pect, that the people here trouble them&s;elves with very few &s;erious thoughts on the &s;ubject; and that, provi|ded they can bring them&s;elves to believe that their favourite Saint looks upon them with an eye of affec|tion, they take it for granted, that under his benign influence, they are freed from all apprehen&s;ions of damnation in a future &s;tate; and indeed, from any great concern about the moral duties of this life. The burning zeal which di&s;tingui&s;hed their
<PB N="210" REF="031692_0533_0FEE75E236BC0DF0">
ance&s;tors above the re&s;t of the Catholic world, appears to have lo&s;t much of its activity, and really &s;eems nearly extingui&s;hed. It is hard to a&s;cribe bounds to the chan|ges of a crafty, &s;teady, and popular monarch might make in eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters. The unconcern betrayed by the whole nation at the fall of the Je&s;uits, is a &s;trong proof of their pre&s;ent indifference. Tho&s;e fathers, the mo&s;t powerful body politic in the kingdom, the rulers of the palace, and the de&s;pots of the cottage, the directors of the con&s;cience, and di&s;po&s;ers of the fortune of every rank of men, were all &s;eized in one night, by detachments of &s;oldiers, hurried like malefac|tors to the &s;ea-ports, and bani&s;hed forever from the realm, without the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance to the royal man|date being made, or even threatened. Their ve|ry memory &s;eems to be annihilated with ther power.</P>
<P>We found the common people inoffen&s;ive, if not civil; and having never had an opportunity of being witne&s;&s;es to any of their exce&s;&s;es, can &s;ay nothing of their violent jealou&s;y or revenge, which are points mo&s;t writers on Spain have expatiated upon with great plea&s;ure. I believe in this line, as well as in many others, their bad as well as good qualities have been magnified many degrees above the truth.</P>
<P>The national qualities, good and bad, con&s;picuous in the lower cla&s;&s;es of men, are ea&s;ily traced, and very di&s;cernible in tho&s;e of higher rank; for their educa|tion
<PB N="211" REF="031692_0534_0FEE75E66AFB99E0">
is too much neglected, their minds too little en|lightened by &s;tudy or communication with other na|tions, to rub off the general ru&s;t, with which the Spa|ni&s;h genius has, for above an age, been as it were in|cru&s;tated. The public &s;chools and univer&s;ities are in a de&s;picable &s;tate of ignorance and irregularity. Some feeble hope of future reformation is indulged by pa|triots; but time mu&s;t &s;how what probabilities they are grounded on.</P>
<P>The reigns of Charles V. and Philip II. were the times of great men and good authors, the Spani&s;h Au|gu&s;tan age, and continued a few years under Philip III. Since tho&s;e days, it is difficult to point out any orig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nal work of learning or merit, except tho&s;e of Cer|vantes and La Vega, who &s;urvived the re&s;t of the geni|u&s;es of that period.</P>
<P>The common education of an Engli&s;h gentleman would con&s;titute a man of learning here; and &s;hould be under&s;tand Greek, he would be quite a phaenome|non.</P>
<P>As to the nobility, I wonder how they ever learned to read or write: or having once attained &s;o much, how they contrive not to forget it. It is difficult to &s;ay what they pa&s;s their time in; or by what means, be&s;ides inattention to bu&s;ine&s;s, they employ in running through their immen&s;e incomes.</P>

<P>THE Spani&s;h women are in general little and thin. Few are &s;trikingly beautiful, but almo&s;t all have &s;park|ling black eyes, full of expre&s;&s;ion. It is not the fa&s;h|ion here, as in France, to heighten their <HI>eclat</HI> with paint.

<P>A VERY furious example of pa&s;&s;ion and cruelty happened while I was in Spain. A Carmelite friar fell de&s;perately in love with a young woman to whom he was confe&s;&s;or. He tried every art of &s;eduction his de&s;ires could &s;ugge&s;t to him: but to his un&s;peakable vexation, found her virtue or indifference proof again&s;t all his machinations. His de&s;pair was heightened to a pitch of madne&s;s, upon hearing that &s;he was &s;oon to be married to a per&s;on of her own rank in life. The furies of jealou&s;y &s;eized his &s;oul, and worked him up to the mo&s;t barbarous of all determinations, that of de|priving his rival of the prize, by putting an end to her exi&s;tence. He cho&s;e Ea&s;ter-week for the perpetration of his crime. The un&s;u&s;pecting girl came to the con|fe&s;&s;ional,
<PB N="215" REF="031692_0538_0FEE75EC89BF50C8">
and poured out her &s;oul at his feet. Her in|nocence &s;erved only to inflame his rage the more, and to confirm him in his bloody purpo&s;e. He gave her ab&s;olution and the &s;acrament with his own hands, as his love deterred him from murdering her before he tho't &s;he was purified from all &s;tain of &s;in, and her &s;oul fit to take its flight to the tribunal of its Creator; but his jealou&s;y and revenge urged him to pur&s;ue her down the church, and plunge his dagger in her heart, as &s;he turned round to make a genuflection to the altar. He was immediately &s;eized, and &s;oon condemned to die; but le&s;t his ignominious execution &s;hould reflect di&s;honor on a religious order, which boa&s;ts of having an aunt of the king of France among its members, his &s;entence was changed into perpetual labour among the galley-&s;laves of Porto Rico.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. LXXXIX. OF THE BATHS AT BAGNERES.</HEAD>
<P>BAGNERES derives its name from the mineral baths which were known and frequented by the anci|ent Romans, as many in&s;criptions and monuments &s;till exi&s;ting on the &s;pot, &s;atisfactorily demon&s;trate.</P>
<P>The pea&s;ants of the neighbourhood are a lively race, and often a&s;&s;emble in a &s;hady walk near the gates to dance. One of the queens of Navarre remitted all fines upon alienation of property at Bagneres, on con|dition that a &s;mall &s;um &s;hould be levied upon each per&s;on admitted to his freedom, and &s;pent in bonfires and other merry expences at Mid&s;ummer.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of this place is happily calculated for all exerci&s;es that tend to the recovery of health. It is built on a flat and very dry &s;oil. Every part of it en|joys an ea&s;y communication with the fields, the banks of the river, or the high-roads, where the weaker &s;ort of vi&s;itants may breathe the fre&s;h air, and regain &s;trength by moderate exertions; while the more vigo|rous, who repair to Bagneres for the &s;ake of amu&s;e|ment, may climb delightful hills, and wander among
<PB N="217" REF="031692_0540_0FEE75F0E4DA0948">
&s;hady groves, through a variety of land&s;capes. The plains and eminences are traver&s;ed by innumerable paths acce&s;&s;ible to hor&s;emen as well as foot-pa&s;&s;engers. The high grounds are not like tho&s;e in the Alps, bro|ken and precipitous, but ea&s;ily &s;loped, and clothed with &s;oft and plea&s;ant verdure. The timber that crowns their &s;ummits is of the noble&s;t &s;ize. In the heart of cultivation, and near the foot of the moun|tains, the Spani&s;h che&s;nut predominates, intermingled with cherry, walnut, and other fruit trees, round which the vine entwines its tendrils. Higher up the extent of pa&s;ture becomes more con&s;iderable. The middle regions of the mountains are darkened with woods of beech overhung by fore&s;ts of &s;ilver fir, and above all, black pinnacles of rocks &s;hoot up to a frightful height, with here and there a wreath of &s;now pre&s;erved un|melted through the &s;ummer by the protection of their &s;hade.</P>
<P>That &s;ide of the mountains which faces the noon|tide &s;un is richly covered with wood; but the opp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ite &s;lope is &s;eldom &s;o beautiful, for it produces fewer trees, and tho&s;e of a &s;tinted growth. The greate&s;t part of the&s;e fore&s;ts is the common property of the neighbouring villages, and as high as carriage can be ea&s;ily contrived, is cut after a regular but carele&s;s manner, for the &s;up|ply of fuel, and the purpo&s;es of hu&s;bandry.</P>
<P>The medicinal waters at Bagneres have alone re&s;cu|ed
<PB N="218" REF="031692_0541_0FEE75F6629A17E0">
this valley from the ob&s;curity which involves &s;o many neighbouring beautiful di&s;tricts. A great num|ber of boiling, lukewarm, and cold &s;treams i&s;&s;ue out of the &s;ides of the mountain that covers the town on the we&s;tern a&s;pect. All of them po&s;&s;e&s;s, or are &s;uppo&s;ed to po&s;&s;e&s;s, very &s;trong healing qualities, which each pa|tient applies with great confidence to his parti|cular di&s;order, under the directions of the phy&s;icians of the place. The &s;ummit of this mountain is indent|ed with a large hollow, &s;imilar to the crater of a volca|no, and I have no doubt but fire has been emitted from this cup at &s;ome period beyond the reach of hi&s;tory. The fire which was then &s;ufficient to produce explo|&s;ions, and to ca&s;t forth torrents of lava, &s;till retains the power in its weaker &s;tate, of imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rting virtue in vari|ous degrees to the mineral &s;prings that flow from the mountain where its focus is e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The number of wells and baths amount to thirty. Some are covered in for the u&s;e of patients, who can afford to pay for their cures. Others are open pools where the poorer cla&s;s gargle their ulcerous throats, or lave their &s;ores, gratis. The heat of &s;ome &s;pouts is at fir&s;t almo&s;t in&s;upportable, but gradually grows le&s;s painful. I have &s;een people expo&s;e their decea&s;ed limbs to the boiling &s;tream for more than a quarter of an hour at a time. The hotte&s;t &s;pring rai&s;es the quick|&s;ilver in Farrenheit's thermometer to 123 degrees, while
<PB N="219" REF="031692_0542_0FEE75F966C402E0">
the coole&s;t cau&s;es it to a&s;cend no higher than 86. Out of the thirty different &s;ources two are exactly equal in heat to that of the human body, ten below, and eight|teen above it. Their medicinal qualities differ no le&s;s e&s;&s;entially than their degrees of heat; for the waters of the Queen's bath are &s;trongly purgative, tho&s;e of Salut and Le Pr&eacute;&punc;diuretic and cooling.</P>
<P>The bath of Salut is &s;ituated about a mile from the town, among the mountains. A plea&s;ant winding road leads to it, through beautiful fields planted with clumps of che&s;nut trees. The hou&s;es and groves on the &s;ur|rounding hills cheer the pro&s;pect; but in &s;o hot a &s;ea&s;on, and in this latitude, an avenue would be a grea|ter improvement and relief to the patients.</P>
<P>The &s;pring is copious, and equal to the demands of the crowds that flock round it on hollidays, when eve|ry per&s;on may drink his fill for the value of three far|things Engli&s;h. The vogue is &s;o great, that two gui|neas have been taken in one morning, at this low price.</P>
<P>From the drinking place the waters are conveyed into two marble troughs, which are in con&s;tant u&s;e during the whole &s;ea&s;on. Seniority of re&s;idence con|&s;titues the right of bathing, and therefore many late comers, who fore&s;ee but a di&s;tant pro&s;pect of being accommodated with an hour of Salut, take up with the other baths of inferior reputation, but perhaps equal
<PB N="220" REF="031692_0543_0FEE75FAEC7CE698">
efficacy. The degree of heat of Salut is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">8&frac12;. When evaporated by a &s;low equal fire, the &s;urface of its wa|ter is covered with a pellicle formed by &s;mall in&s;ipid chry&s;tals, which towards the completion of the evapo|ration acquire con&s;iderable acritude. The&s;e waters contain no particles of iron, but &s;mall parallelopiped pyrites are frequently found in them, of a bright gol|den colour, and about an inch long.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XC. JOURNEY INTO THE HEART OF THE PYRENEAN MOUNTAINS.</HEAD>
<P>I RETURNED ye&s;terday to Bagneres from a jour|ney on hor&s;eback, through the mo&s;t romantic and cu|rious part of the Pyrennees, and ha&s;ten to impart my ob&s;ervations, while each idea is &s;till impre&s;&s;ed with force on "the tablet of my memory."</P>
<P>I &s;et out on the &s;ixth of Augu&s;t with &s;ome friends, and travelled up the valley. The low grounds are fine|ly cultivated. Numberle&s;s &s;treams pour acro&s;s the
<PB N="221" REF="031692_0544_0FEE75FE08F2E8A8">
road, and hurry to blend their waters with tho&s;e of the Adour, which is here confined to a narrow bed. Be|yond it ea&s;tward, the mountains are covered with beau|tiful verdure. At their foot &s;tands A&s;t&eacute;, a village be|longing to the family of Crammont.</P>
<P>A pea&s;ant who re&s;ides here, earns a livelihood by &s;upplying the apothecaries with medicinal plants, which he gathers on the adjacent mountains, particularly that of Lieris, ju&s;tly celebrated for the immen&s;e and varie|gated &s;how of flowers, that cover its elevated pa&s;tures, before &s;heep and cattle are let in to graze.</P>
<P>The convent of capuchins, at Medous, oppo&s;ite to A&s;t&eacute;, is placed &s;o clo&s;ely under a mountain, that in winter it enjoys but two hours &s;un &s;hine in the whole day. Its garden is remarkable for a large volume of water, that i&s;&s;ues out of the rocks. Trouts are often &s;een &s;wimming down the &s;tream, but if di&s;turbed, they retire into the bowels of the mountain, to &s;ome &s;ubter|raneous lake.</P>
<P>The populou&s;ne&s;s of this vale is &s;carce credible. In the extent of three miles I reckoned near five hundred hou&s;es or barns. The burgh of Campan gives name to the upper di&s;trict, and is famous for the excellency of its butter. It acknowledges no lord but the king, and has con&s;iderable woods and cultivated lands, ap|pertaining to its community.</P>
<P>At a &s;mall di&s;tance above the town, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> con|ducted
<PB N="222" REF="031692_0545_0FEE760352CB5EF0">
to a celebrated grotto, in the &s;ide of a bare mountain. The entrance is narrow and &s;loping, but at the depth of ten feet, the floor of the cavern lies nearly on a level. The vault &s;eldom exceeds nine feet in height. Its length is an hundred and four yards. The path is wet and rugged. The walls and roof are incru&s;tated with chry&s;tali&s;ations; but all that were curious for &s;ize, &s;hape, or beauty of colour, had been broken off and carried away by pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ceeding travellers. At the end of the grotto we found a marble &s;lab, fixed up by order of the counte&s;s of Brionne, to commemorate that after infinite labour, &s;he, with her family and &s;er|vants, who&s;e names are all con&s;igned to immortality on this &s;ubterraneous monument, penetrated thus far into the bowels of the earth, in the year 1766.</P>
<P>Above Campan the valley grew more confined. The hills on the right hand were &s;tudded with trees and barns, and covered with lively verdure; tho&s;e on the left, were rocky, barren, and &s;avage. At the chapel of St. Mary, two branches of the Adour flow from different glens and join their waters. We rode up the more we&s;tern &s;tream to Grip, where all level ground terminates. Noble groves of fir overhang the river, which da&s;hes &s;ucce&s;&s;ively down three romantic falls. Having taken &s;ome refre&s;hment we proceeded up the mountain by a winding, &s;teep, and rugged path,
<PB N="223" REF="031692_0546_0FEE76079900B608">
through a fore&s;t of &s;ilver and &s;pruce firs. We occa&s;ion|ally caught views of the river foaming among the rocks and trees, and in one &s;pot darting over a va&s;t precipice in a full, magnificent &s;heet.</P>
<P>Upon leaving the woods we cro&s;&s;ed a large naked plain, at the foot of the Pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> du midi, the highe&s;t mountain on the Pyrenees. The Adour i&s;&s;ues out of a pyramidical hill, a few miles farther up, and winds in a &s;mall &s;tream through the ru&s;hy pa&s;tures. Abund|ance of flowers animate the face of this otherwi&s;e dull &s;cene of nature. We were now arrived in the highe&s;t point of land we had to &s;urmount, when we were &s;ur|pri&s;ed by a very heavy fall of &s;now, that whitened all the &s;urrounding eminences, but &s;oon melted into rain and wetted us thoroughly</P>
<P>When the &s;torm abated, and the atmo&s;phere grew clear, a horrible view opened down the valley of Bare|ges. Rude and barren mountains &s;hade it on both &s;ides, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a foaming torrent, fills the inter|mediate hollow. We de&s;cended by the edge of the blacke&s;t and mo&s;t de&s;olute places in nature, where not a tree was to be &s;een: but the heights were &s;eamed with yawning crevices, and the pa&s;&s;ages block|ed up with quarries of &s;tone, tumbled from the cliffs by the irre&s;i&s;table force of the waters.</P>
<P>In this frightful cha&s;m &s;tands the village of Bareges, con&s;i&s;ting of a &s;ingle &s;treet built along the &s;outh &s;ide of
<PB N="224" REF="031692_0547_0FEE760A5B3AA460">
the torrent. The &s;ituation is &s;o dangerous and horrid; that the inhabitants dare not abide here in winter. They remove all their furniture, even doors and win|dows, to &s;uch hou&s;es as are &s;uppo&s;ed mo&s;t out of the way of mi&s;chief. A few invalid &s;oldiers alone remain, to pre&s;erve the &s;prings from being buried under the earth that &s;lides down from the mountains. Some|times a large volume of water bu&s;ts out of its &s;ide, the overplus of a lake on the &s;ummit, and &s;weeps off all be|fore it. Every year &s;ome hou&s;es are wa&s;hed away by the floods, or cru&s;hed under the weight of &s;now. The <HI>avelanches,</HI> or heaps of &s;now that are detached from the mountains, are often &s;o prodigious as to fill up the whole bottom of the glen; and the river has been known to roll for &s;everal weeks through an arch of its own forming under this immea&s;urable ma&s;s.</P>
<P>The mineral waters, for which Bareges is famed, i&s;|&s;ue out of the hill in the center of the village, and are di&s;tributed into three baths. They are very fetid, but clear in the gla&s;s. Their degrees of heat ri&s;e from 89 to 112&frac34; They are grea&s;y to the touch, tinge &s;ilver black, and are e&s;teemed &s;overeign in the cure of ulcers, wounds, and &s;crophulous humours. The baths belong to the king, and are entirely under the direction of his &s;urgeons.</P>
<P>The poor have the u&s;e of a large bath covered with boards, and are fed by a tax of &s;ix livres impo&s;ed upon
<PB N="225" REF="031692_0548_0FEE760D1E8FAF48">
all new comers. With this fund a comfortable dinner is provided for them, and di&s;tributed in pre&s;ence of the governor, a worthy veteran, who &s;olicited this command from a motive of gratitude, having been cured of a dan|gerous wound by bathing it with the&s;e waters.</P>
<P>No company re&s;orts hither merely for amu&s;ement. Di&s;orders only, and tho&s;e &s;evere and inveterate ones, can induce people to inhabit the&s;e wild regions. There is an a&s;&s;embly-room and regular bath, when it is, I know not whether a melancholy or a ludicrous &s;ight, to behold &s;everal couples dancing together, &s;ome with a leg bound up, others with an arm in a &s;ling, and all with a feeble body and a &s;ickly a&s;pect.</P>
<P>In the&s;e mountainous &s;cenes nature exhibits her bold|e&s;t features. Here every object is extended upon a va&s;t &s;cale, and the whole a&s;&s;emblage impre&s;&s;es the &s;pectator with awe as well as admiration. I wi&s;h it were po&s;&s;i|ble for me to communicate, by means of words or of paintings, the rapturous &s;en&s;ations excited in my mind by the &s;ight of tho&s;e &s;ublime works of the Creator.</P>
<P>As we advanced on our journey we found our&s;elves immured in a narrow valley, with the Ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e roaring below us, between walls of immen&s;e, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> and fre|quently hidden from our view by thick <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of lime and oak trees. The path was wide enough for our mountain hor&s;es, but very alarming to &s;ome unexperi|enced travellers in our company. On one hand a per|pendicular
<PB N="226" REF="031692_0549_0FEE760EA3F0D228">
rock, without any parapet, laid open the deep gloomy bed of the river almo&s;t under our feet, and a &s;hivery mountain pre&s;&s;ed &s;o clo&s;e upon us on the other, as to leave no room for a retreat. The turns in the road, where torrents have heaped &s;tones, and choaked the pa&s;s with rubbi&s;h, are particularly di&s;tre&s;&s;|ing; but our hor&s;es were &s;o unconcerned and &s;ure|footed, that they &s;oon in&s;pired their riders with equal indifference fot the &s;urrounding perils.</P>
<P>The whole valley is occupied by the river and the road, with va&s;t piles of mountains ri&s;ing on each &s;ide, and almo&s;t clo&s;ing together. Now and then level &s;pots occur at the angles of the river. We cro&s;&s;ed a bridge romantically clothed with ivy, which hid the tremendous cha&s;m from our eyes. Huge rocks rear up their perpendicular points, and torrents ru&s;h over them on all &s;ides. The mountain-a&s;h, and &s;ervice-tree, blu&s;hing with clu&s;tered berries, bend over the preci|pices, and &s;often the har&s;hne&s;s of the wild pro&s;pect. After this the valley rather &s;wells out, and more room is allowed for the indefatigable indu&s;try of the inhabi|tants to exert it&s;elf; but great part of the level, and all the lower regions of the mountains, are overgrown with wood, inter&s;per&s;ed with a charming variety of flowering &s;hrubs. Many of the favourite denizons of our Engli&s;h gardens flouri&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">here in all their native luxuriancy.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="031692_0550_0FEE76116BA7E740">
This dale terminates at Gecres, a rambling village on the &s;ide of the mountain. The road is afterwards cut through the rock, and leads to a &s;ituation that gave us an idea of confu&s;ion and de&s;olation, the effects of &s;ome violent earthquake. The mountain is &s;plit and torn to pieces. Its &s;ides and foot are &s;trewed with innumerable huge blocks of &s;tone, detached from the impending ridge that forms its bare &s;ummit. The pa&s;&s;age through this rocky labyrinth opened to a mag|nificent amphitheatre. On the top waved thick for|e&s;ts of firs, through which &s;everal &s;treams forcing their way, da&s;hed down the lofty precipice, but almo&s;t va|ni&s;hed away in mi&s;t before they could reach the bot|tom. The field below was beautifully over&s;pread with purple monk&s;hood.</P>
<P>Our morning's expedition ended at Gabarnie, where we found good accommodations prepared for us by a me&s;&s;enger we had di&s;patched the preceding day. This is a village con&s;i&s;ting of a church and thirty hou&s;es, in the mid&s;t of bare hills, &s;haded by very high moun|tains, and traver&s;ed in &s;everal directions, by foaming torrents. The curate partook of our dinner, after we had removed the table to the door of the inn&punc; for he dur&s;t neither eat nor drink within the walls of a pub|lic hou&s;e. We found him a mode&s;t conver&s;able man, worthy of a richer &s;ettlement.</P>
<P>After dinner we travelled towards the head of the
<PB N="228" REF="031692_0551_0FEE76142E43F6B0">
Gave, the object of our journey. We had long had in view the &s;now-capped-cliffs from which its waters i&s;&s;ue, but were &s;urpri&s;ed to find them &s;till &s;o di&s;tant from us. We &s;pent an hour and a half in riding acro&s;s a bare tract of pa&s;ture, clo&s;ed in with immen&s;e fore&s;ts of evergreens on the French &s;ide along the Spani&s;h frontier, which lies on the right hand confined by bare rocky mountains. This plain is called the <HI>Prade.</HI> The river follows a &s;erpentine cour&s;e through it. In winter it is generally covered with &s;now forty feet deep.</P>
<P>Our guide having now brought us to his <HI>ne plus ul|tra,</HI> pre&s;&s;ed us earne&s;tly to alight, as no hor&s;e had ev|er advanced beyond this pa&s;s. But as we were not contented with &s;o di&s;tant a view, we rejected his timid advice, and clambering over &s;everal rocky eminences, plunged into the river, which by its limpidity deceiv|ed our eye, both as to the debth of water, and the &s;ize of the rocks at the bottom. It required our utmo&s;t exertions to extricate out hou&s;es, and bear them &s;afe through to the oppo&s;ite bank. This difficulty being overcome, all others appeared contemptable, and we &s;oon reached the center of a mo&s;t &s;tupendous amphi|theatre. Three &s;ides of it are formed by a range of perpendicular rocks: the fourth is &s;haded with wood. Above the upright wall, which is of a horrible height, ri&s;e &s;everal &s;tages of broken ma&s;&s;es, each covered with
<PB N="229" REF="031692_0552_0FED383A6CF57DB0">
a layer of everla&s;ting &s;now. The mountain ea&s;tward ends in &s;harp pinnacles, and runs off to the we&s;t in one immen&s;e bank of &s;now. From the&s;e concealed heaps the Gave derives its excellence. Thirteen &s;treams ru&s;h down the mighty precipice, and unite their wa|ters at its foot.</P>
<P>The whole we&s;tern corner of the area below is fill|ed with a bed of &s;now, which being &s;truck by few rays of the &s;un at any &s;ea&s;on, receives a &s;ufficient vol|ume of fre&s;h &s;now every winter to balance the lo&s;s occa&s;ioned by the warmth of the atmo&s;phere in &s;um|mer. Two of the torrents fell upon this exten&s;ive frozen &s;urface. They have worn a huge cha&s;m, and extending from it, a vaulted pa&s;&s;age five hundred yards in length, through which their waters roll. We bold|ly rode over this extraordinary bridge, and alighting at the foot of the rocks, walked down the pa&s;&s;age. The &s;now lies above it near twenty feet thick. The roof is about &s;ix feet above the ground, and finely turned in an arch, which appears as if it had been cut and chi&s;&s;eled by the hand of man. In &s;ome places there are columns and collateral galleries. The whole glitter|ed like a diamond, and was beautifully pervaded by the light. The only inconvenience we felt, aro&s;e from the dripping occa&s;ioned by the extreme heat of the day by which even this great body of &s;now was &s;trong|ly affected.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="031692_0553_0FEE7618772FBF20">
As we emerged with the river from this &s;ingular grotto, we unharboured three chamoy goats, that had taken refuge in the mouth of the cave, again&s;t the burning rays of noon. They darted acro&s;s the plain, and a&s;cended the &s;teepe&s;t parts of the rocks, where we &s;oon lo&s;t &s;ight of them. The&s;e animals are called <HI>Y&s;ards</HI> in this country. They are rather &s;maller than the fallow deer, of a muddy reddi&s;h yellow colour, with &s;nubbed no&s;e, and &s;hort black horns. In &s;hape they re&s;emble a deer, walking with their heads upright, and &s;kipping away with admirable &s;wiftne&s;s. But they do not bound; they run when at full &s;tretch. No bea&s;t of the fore&s;t is of more difficult acce&s;s. They &s;el|dom quit the highe&s;t and mo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible parts of the mountains. During the wintry &s;torms they have been &s;een fixed on the brow of a precipice, with their faces towards the wind, probably to prevent the rain and &s;now from lodging under their hair.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding their &s;u&s;picious, wild nature, and their extreme velocity, the hardy mountaineers find means to de&s;troy them.

<HEAD>SECT. XCI. OF PORTUGAL IN GENERAL; THE PRO|DUCE OF THE COUNTRY, AND THE CUS|TOMS AND MANNERS OF THE PEOPLE.</HEAD>
<P>THE kingdom of Portugal is &s;ituated to the we&s;t of Spain, from which it is &s;eparated on the north and the ea&s;t by the river Minho, and &s;ome &s;mall rivers and hills: on the &s;outh and we&s;t it is wa&s;hed by the &s;ea. Its whole extent from north to &s;outh is three hundred miles, and its breadth from ea&s;t to we&s;t, where broade&s;t, is about one hundred and twenty. It is in the &s;ame climate with Spain, and as well as that country, is very mountainous; but the &s;oil is in general wor&s;e, and never produces corn enough for the &s;upport of its in|habitants. As to wheat, it has always produced le&s;s of that valuable grain, than what the people require. In the &s;outhern parts pa&s;ture is always &s;carce, and the cattle &s;mall and lean, though the fle&s;h is generally well ta&s;ted. But to make amends for this want of corn and pa&s;ture, here are made va&s;t quantities of wine, which is indeed the be&s;t commodity of this kingdom. Oil is al&s;o made here in great abundance, but it is far
<PB N="233" REF="031692_0556_0FEE761E754C1E88">
inferior to that of Spain and Italy. Lemons and oranges likewi&s;e grow here; and are exported in great quantities, though the acidity of the latter is not near &s;o plea&s;ant, as tho&s;e that come from Seville; nor in|deed are their rai&s;ins, figs, almonds, and che&s;nuts either &s;o large, or &s;o well ta&s;ted as tho&s;e of Spain. However, their &s;weet oranges, which they have introduced from China, and are thence called China oranges, are the be&s;t of the kind in Europe. Herbs and flowers of all &s;orts are here commonly very good, and abundance of perfumed waters are di&s;tilled from tho&s;e of the odorif|erous kind, which are here in great reque&s;t, they being u&s;ed in almo&s;t every thing that is eat, drank or worn.</P>
<P>The wollen manufactures of this country are &s;o in|different and coar&s;e, that they are only worn by the meaner &s;ort; and though their &s;ilks are in &s;ome places much better, they are far inferior in beauty and good|ne&s;s to tho&s;e made in Spain.</P>
<P>The modern Portugue&s;e retain nothing of that ad|venturous enterprizing &s;pirit that rendered their fore|fathers &s;o illu&s;trious three hundred years ago. They have, ever &s;ince the hou&s;e of Braganza mounted the throne, degenerated in all their virtues; though &s;ome noble exceptions are &s;till remaining among them, and no people are &s;o little obliged as the Portugue&s;e are to the reports of hi&s;torians and travellers. The degenera|cy is evidently owing to the weakne&s;s of their mo|narchy,
<PB N="234" REF="031692_0557_0FEE761FFA0034A0">
which renders them inactive; and that inac|tivity has proved the &s;ource of pride, and other un|manly vices. Treachery has been laid to their charge, as well as ingratitude, and above all, an intemperate pa&s;&s;ion for revenge. They are, if po&s;&s;ible, more &s;u|per&s;titious, and, both in high and common life, affect more &s;tate than the Spaniards them&s;elves. Among the lower people, thieving is commonly practi&s;ed; and all ranks are accu&s;ed of being unfair in their dealings, e&s;pecially with &s;trangers. It is hard, however, to &s;ay what alteration may be made in the character of the Portugue&s;e, by the expul&s;ion of the Je&s;uits, and the diminution of the papal influence among them, but a|bove all, by that &s;pirit of independency, with regard to commercial affairs, upon Great Britian, which, not much to the honour of their gratitude, though to the in|tere&s;t of their own country is now &s;o much encoura|ged by their court and mini&s;try.</P>
<P>The Portugue&s;e are neither &s;o tall nor &s;o well made as the Spaniards, who&s;e habits and cu&s;toms they imi|tate; only the quality affect to be more gaily and rich|ly dre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The women are mo&s;tly beautiful when young, though their complexion is inclinable to the olive; but the indi&s;creet u&s;e of paint renders their &s;kins &s;hrivel|led as with old age, before they are turned of thirty. Their eyes, however, which are generally black and
<PB N="235" REF="031692_0558_0FEE7622C6B168D0">
&s;parkling, retain their lu&s;tre after their other charms are withered. The quick decay of beauty is in &s;ome mea&s;ure recompenced by the vivacity of their wit, in which they are &s;aid to excel the women of all other nations. They are extremely charitable and generous, and remarkable for their mode&s;ty.</P>
<P>Spectacles are commonly worn here as well as in Spain, as a mark of age and gravity; for it is ob&s;erva|ble of the&s;e two nations, that old age, with a grave and &s;olemn behaviour, procure &s;uch re&s;pect, that the young affect to imitate the &s;olemnity of the old.</P>
<P>Li&s;bon, the capital of Portugal, is built upon &s;even hills, and is thought to contain 200,000 inhabitants. Some of the hills ri&s;e up above the re&s;t: and &s;ome again are &s;o interwoven and contra&s;ted, that they form an agreeable diver&s;ity of hills and vales; &s;o that, from the oppo&s;ite &s;ides of the Tagus, it looks like an im|men&s;e amphitheatre, which has all the charms that can be produced by a variety of the mo&s;t &s;umptuous edifices, reflecting uncommon beauties upon each oth|er by the happine&s;s of their &s;ituation. Nor do the fine pro&s;pects of the country give le&s;s plea&s;ure when they are viewed from the eminences in the city; for what can be a finer &s;ight than a beautiful country, and &s;uch a river as the Tagus, covered with fore&s;ts of &s;hips from all nations? Its &s;ituation certainly, renders its ap|pearance at once delightful and &s;uperb, and it is de&s;erv|edly

accounted the greate&s;t port in Europe, next to London and Am&s;terdam.</P>
<P>The city, before the great earthquake, afforded &s;till a nobler pro&s;pect when viewed from the river, than it does at pre&s;ent, on account of the gradual a&s;cent of the buildings. But this dreadful earthquake, which began on the fir&s;t of November, 1775, at about ten in the morning, laid the fine&s;t buildings of Li&s;bon in ru|ins, and reduced that city to a &s;cene of the mo&s;t terri|ble de&s;olation. To complete the publick di&s;tre&s;s, a fire &s;oon after broke out and &s;pread among the ruins; and by the&s;e di&s;a&s;ters the King's Palace, the Cu&s;tom|hou&s;e, St. Dominic's church, St. Nicholas's, and ma|ny others, were either thrown down or con&s;umed, to|gether with a great number of private hou&s;es. But happily &s;ome whole &s;treets e&s;caped the general calam|ity, and were left &s;tanding entire.</P>
<P>All that part of the city which was demoli&s;hed by the earthquake, is now planned out in the mo&s;t regular and commodious form. Some large &s;quares and many &s;treets are already built. The &s;treets form right angles, and are broad and &s;pacious. The hou&s;es are lofty, ele|gant, and uniform; and being built of white &s;tone, make a beautiful appearance.</P>
<P>The air here is &s;o &s;oft, and the &s;ky &s;o clear, that it is quite delicious; which joined to the excellence of the water, makes the inhabitants &s;o extremely healthy,

that they have the happine&s;s of living to a very great age, without being oppre&s;&s;ed with infirmities, and con|tinually attacked by fre&s;h di&s;orders, as is u&s;ual in oth|er climates. The climate is &s;o temperate, that they have ro&s;es and many other &s;orts of flowers, even in the winter.</P>
<P>The &s;econd city in this kingdom is Oporto, which is computed to contain 30,000 inhabitants.

<HEAD>SECT. XCII. OF NORWAY, AND BERGEN ITS CAPITAL.</HEAD>
<P>THE climate of Norway is much more various than in mo&s;t other European countries. In the &s;um|mer-nights, the horizon when unclouded, is &s;o clear and luminous, that at midnight one may read, write, and do all kinds of work as in the day; and in the ex|tremity of this country, towards the i&s;lands of Finmark, the &s;un is continually in view in the mid&s;t of &s;ummer, and is ob&s;erved to circulate day and night round the north pole, contracting its orbit, and then gradually en|larging it, till at length it leaves the horizon. On the other hand, in the depth of winter, the &s;un is invi&s;ible for &s;ome weeks; all the light perceived at noon being a faint glimmering of about an hour and a half's contin|uance; which, as the &s;un never appears above the ho|rizon, chiefly proceeds from the reflection of the rays on the highe&s;t mountains, who&s;e &s;ummits are &s;een more clearly than any other objects. But the wi&s;e and boun|tiful Creator has granted the inhabitants all po&s;&s;ible a&s;|&s;i&s;tance; for be&s;ides the moon-&s;hine, which by reflection from the mountains is exceedingly bright in valleys, the people receive con&s;iderable relief from the <HI>Auror<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="239" REF="031692_0562_0FEE762F269117B8">
Borealis,</HI> or nothern lights, which often afford them all the light nece&s;&s;ary to their ordinary labours.</P>
<P>On the ea&s;t &s;ide of Norway, the cold of winter gen|erally &s;ets in about the middle of October, and la&s;ts till the middle of April. The waters are congealed to a thick ice, and the mountains and valleys covered with &s;now. However, this is of &s;uch importance to the welfare of the country, that in a mild winter, the pea&s;ants who live among the mountains are con&s;ider|able &s;ufferers; for without this &s;evere fro&s;t and &s;now, they can neither convey the timber they have felled, to the rivers, nor carry their corn, butter, furs and oth|er commodities, in their &s;ledges, to the market towns; and after the &s;ale of them carry back the nece&s;&s;aries they are &s;upplied with. For the large&s;t rivers, with their roaring cataracts are arre&s;ted in their cour&s;e by the fro&s;t, and the very &s;pittle is no &s;ooner out of the mouth than it is congealed, and rolls along the ground like hail. But the wi&s;e Creator has given the inhabi|tants of this cold climate a greater variety of pre&s;erva|tives again&s;t the weather than mo&s;t other countries afford. Exten&s;ive fore&s;ts &s;upply them with plenty of timber for building, and for fuel. The wool of the &s;heep, and the furs and &s;kins of wild bea&s;ts, furni&s;h them with warm lining for their cloaths, and covering for their beds. Innumerable flights of wild fowl &s;up|ply them with down and feathers. The mountains

them&s;elves &s;erve them for fences again&s;t the north and ea&s;t winds, and their caverns afford them &s;hel|ter.</P>
<P>In the &s;ummer months, the weather is not only warm but very hot. The&s;e violent heats, which are, however, of &s;hort duration, may be partly derived from the valleys being inclo&s;ed within high mountains, where the reverberation of the rays of the &s;un on all &s;ides heat the hair; and as there is almo&s;t no night, neither the atmo&s;phere nor the mountains have time to cool. Indeed there cannot be a more deci&s;ive proof of the &s;ummer's heat in Norway, than that &s;eve|ral vegetables, (and particularly barley) grow up and ripen within &s;ix weeks or two months.</P>
<P>The air is pure and &s;alubrious, e&s;pecially in the middle of the country about the mountains where the inhabitants know little of &s;ickne&s;s. Phy&s;icians are on|ly to be found in the chief towns, where they are e&s;ta|bli&s;hed with a public &s;alary, but have generally very little employment.</P>
<P>Norway contains a va&s;t number of mountains, &s;ome of which extend them&s;elves in a long chain fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> north to &s;outh, while others are &s;cattered about and &s;urrounded by a level country.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of a mountainous country may be &s;aid to labour under more inconveniences than others. Thus the arable ground is here but little in compari|&s;on
<PB N="241" REF="031692_0564_0FEE763A5A1448E8">
of the wa&s;tes and de&s;arts, which obliges the inha|bitants to procure half their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from the &s;ea. The villages are &s;mall, and the hou&s;es &s;cattered among the valleys. But in &s;ome places the pea&s;ant's hou&s;es &s;tand &s;o high, and on the edge of &s;teep precipices, that ladders are fixed to climb up to them; &s;o that when a cleryman is &s;ent for, who is unpracti&s;ed in the road, he ri&s;ks his life in a&s;cending them, e&s;pecially in winter, when the ways are &s;lippery. In &s;uch places the bo|dies of the dead mu&s;t be let down with ropes, or be brought on people's backs before they are laid in a coffin; and, at &s;ome di&s;tance from Bergen, the mail mu&s;t likewi&s;e in winter be drawn over the &s;teepe&s;t mountains.</P>
<P>Another evil re&s;ulting from the mountains, is the &s;helter they afford in their caverns and clefts to the wild bea&s;ts, which render it difficult to extirpate them. It is not ea&s;y to de&s;cribe the havock made by the lynxes, foxes, bears, and e&s;pecially wolves, among the cattle, goats, hares, and other u&s;eful animals.</P>
<P>Another evil is, that the cows, &s;heep, and goats be|longing to the pea&s;ants, often fall down the precipices and are de&s;troyed. Sometimes they make a fal&s;e &s;tep into a projection, called a mountain-hammer, where they can neither a&s;cend nor de&s;cend. On this occa&s;ion a pea&s;ant chearfully ventures his life for a &s;heep or a goat; and de&s;cending from the top of a mountain by a
<PB N="242" REF="031692_0565_0FEE763FC3DD6140">
rope of &s;ome hundred fathoms in length, he &s;lings his body on a cro&s;s &s;tick, till he can &s;et his foot on the place where his goat is, when he fa&s;tens it to the rope to be drawn up along with him&s;elf. But the mo&s;t a|mazing circum&s;tance is, that he runs this ri&s;k with the help of only a &s;ingle per&s;on, who holds the end of the rope, or fa&s;tens it to a &s;tone if there be one at hand. There are in&s;tances of the a&s;&s;i&s;tant him&s;elf having been dragged down, and &s;acrificing his life from fi|delity to his friend, on which both have peri&s;hed. On the&s;e melancholy accidents, when man or bea&s;t falls &s;ome hundred <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">athorns down the precipices, it is ob&s;erved, that the air pre&s;&s;es with &s;uch force again&s;t their bodies thus falling, that they are not only depri|ved of life long before they reach the ground, but their bellies bur&s;t and their entrails gu&s;h out, which is plainly the ca&s;e when they fall into deep water.</P>
<P>The country produces wheat, rye, barley, white, grey and green pea&s;e; vetches, u&s;ed as provender for hor&s;es; hops, flax, and hemp; many kinds of roots and greens for the kitchen, with a con&s;iderable num|ber of hardy flowers. In Norway, as well as in Den|mark, are &s;everal kinds of cherries, of which the pea&s;ants &s;ell great quantities dried. There are al&s;o many &s;orts of whole&s;ome and well-ta&s;ted berries, as red and white currants, &s;unberries, ra&s;pberries, red and white goo&s;eberries, barberries, bilberries, cramber|ries,
<PB N="243" REF="031692_0566_0FEE7643D57F6EE8">
&s;trawberries, blackberries, and many other kinds. Several &s;orts of plums attain to a tolerable ripene&s;s, which can very &s;eldom be &s;aid of peaches, apricots, or grapes. However, apples and pears of &s;everal kinds are found all over the country; but the greate&s;t part of the&s;e are &s;ummer-fruits, which ripen early; for the winter-fruit &s;eldom comes to perfection, unle&s;s the &s;ummer proves hotter, and the winter &s;ets in later than u&s;ual.</P>
<P>But though, with re&s;pect to fruit-trees, Norway mu&s;t be acknowledged inferior to mo&s;t countries in Europe, yet this deficiency is liberally compen&s;ated in the ble&s;&s;ings of inexhau&s;tible fore&s;ts; &s;o that in mo&s;t provinces immen&s;e &s;ums are received from foreigners for ma&s;ts, beams, planks, boards, &amp;c. not to men|tion the home con&s;umption for hou&s;es built entirely of beams of wood, &s;hips, bridges, and an infinite num|ber of founderies, which require an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> immen&s;e quantity of charcoal, in the fu&s;ion of metals, be&s;ides the de|mands for fuel and other dome&s;tic u&s;es; to which mu&s;t be added, that in many places the woods are felled on|ly to clear the ground and be burnt, the a&s;hes &s;erving for manure.</P>
<P>Bergen, the capital of Norway, has one of the fine&s;t ports in Europe, and is divided into the upper and lower town, the one built on the rocks, and the oth|er on the &s;ea &s;hore. It is a large trading town, full
<PB N="244" REF="031692_0567_0FEE76455BCF6E38">
of merchants, and was formerly an archbi&s;hopric; but has not been acknowledged &s;uch &s;ince the refor|mation. The Archbi&s;hop's palace was given to the <HI>Hans Towns,</HI> for their ancient merchants to live in, and the greate&s;t part of the hou&s;es were turned into warehou&s;es, which &s;till bear the name of cloi&s;ters, and the merchants are called monks, though they do not wear a cowl, nor ob&s;erve the rules of any order. The king has, however, obliged them &s;o far to keep up the form of a religious hou&s;e, that none of the mer|chants who live in it are allowed to marry without removing. The principal branch of trade carri|ed on at Bergen, are herrings, cod, and &s;tock-fi&s;h, for which there is a great vent in Mu&s;covy, Sweden, Po|land, Denmark, Germany, Holland, and other parts of Europe.</P>

<P>THE Norwegians are generally tall, well made, and lively; yet tho&s;e on the coa&s;t are neither &s;o tall nor &s;o robu&s;t as tho&s;e who inhabit the mountains; but are remarkable for being fatter, and having rounder faces. The people in general are bri&s;k and ingenious; which appears from the pea&s;ants not employing any hatters, &s;hoemakers, taylors, tanners, weavers, carpenters, &s;miths, or joiners; for all the&s;e trades are exerci&s;ed in every farmhou&s;e; and they think a boy can never be a u&s;eful member of &s;ociety, nor a good man, without making him&s;elf ma&s;ter of all the&s;e arts. They are re|markable for their civility and willingne&s;s to &s;erve ev|ery one, and a traveller is &s;eldom &s;uffered to pay for his lodging; for they think it their duty to treat the &s;tranger as well as it is in their power, and look upon it as an honour done them, if he accepts of their civi|lities. The pea&s;ant, however, never gives the up|per end of the table to the greate&s;t gue&s;t that ever
<PB N="246" REF="031692_0569_0FEE7648671B3718">
comes under his roof; for he thinks that place belongs only to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>They keep open hou&s;e for three weeks at Chri&s;tmas, during which their tables are &s;pread and loaded with the be&s;t provi&s;ions they can afford. At Chri&s;tmas-eve their ho&s;pitality extends to the very birds; and, for their u&s;e, they hang on a pole at the barn-door, an un|thre&s;hed &s;heaf of corn, which draws thither the &s;parrows and other &s;mall birds.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the trading towns live, with re&s;|pect to provi&s;ions, much in the &s;ame manner as the Danes; but the pea&s;ants keep clo&s;e to the manners of their fore-fathers. Thin oat-cakes are their common bread; but upon particular occa&s;ions, as weddings or entertainments, they have rye-bread. If grain be &s;carce, which generally happens after a &s;evere winter, the pea&s;ants have recour&s;e to a di&s;agreeable method of pre&s;erving life, by boiling and drying the bark of fir-trees, mixing it with a little oatmeal, and making it in|to a kind of bread. Even in times of plenty they eat a little of it, that they may think it le&s;s di&s;agreeable in a time of &s;carcity.</P>
<P>The lakes and rivers furni&s;h the people with plenty of fre&s;h water fi&s;h, and the mountains with game. For their winter &s;tock they kill cows, &s;heep, and goats; part of which they pickle and &s;moak, and &s;ome of it they cut in thin &s;lices, &s;prinkle it with &s;alt, then dry it
<PB N="247" REF="031692_0570_0FED380A77930148">
in the wind, and eat it like hung beef. They are fond of brandy, and of &s;moaking and chewing tobacco.</P>
<P>The Norwegians who live in towns, have nothing remarkable in their dre&s;s; but the pea&s;ants do not trouble them&s;elves about fa&s;hions. Tho&s;e called &s;trile-farmers have their breeches and &s;tockings of one piece. They have a wide loo&s;e jacket, made of coar&s;e wollen cloth, as are al&s;o their wai&s;tcoats: and tho&s;e who would appear fine, have the &s;eams covered with cloth of a different colour. The pea&s;ants of one pari&s;h are remarkable for wearing black cloths edged with red; another for wearing all black. The dre&s;s of another pari&s;h is white edged with black. Others wear black and yellow. And thus the inhabitants of almo&s;t every pari&s;h vary in the colour of their cloaths. They wear a flapped hat, or a little brown, grey, or black cap, made quite round, and the &s;eams ornamented with black ribbons. They have &s;hoes of a peculiar con|&s;truction without heels, con&s;i&s;ting of two pieces; the upper leather fits clo&s;e to the foot, to which the &s;ole is joined by a great many plaits and folds. When they trav|el, and in the winter, they wear a &s;ort of half boots that reach up to the calf of the leg, and are laced on one &s;ide; and when they go on the rocks in the &s;now, they put on &s;now &s;hoes. But as the&s;e are trouble&s;ome when they have a great way to travel, they put on &s;kaits about as broad as the foot, but &s;ix or eight feet
<PB N="248" REF="031692_0571_0FEE764B2DE02FB8">
long, and pointed before. They are covered under|neath with &s;eal-&s;kin, to that the &s;mooth grain of the hair turns backward to the heel. With the&s;e &s;now &s;kaits they &s;lide about on the &s;now as well as they can upon the ice, and fa&s;ter than any hor&s;e.</P>
<P>The pea&s;ant never wears a neck cloth, or any thing of that kind, except when he is dre&s;&s;ed; for his neck and brea&s;t are always open, and he lets the &s;now beat into his bo&s;om. On the contrary, he covers his veins, binding a woollen fillet round his wri&s;ts. About their body they wear a broad leathern belt, ornamented with convex bra&s;s plates; to this hangs a bra&s;s chain, which holds their large knife, gimblet, and other tackle.</P>
<P>The women at church, and in genteel a&s;&s;emblies, dre&s;s them&s;elves in jackets laced clo&s;e, and have leath|ern girdles, with &s;ilver ornaments about them. They al&s;o wear a &s;ilver chain three or four times round the neck, with a gilt medal hanging at the end of it. Their handerchiefs and caps are almo&s;t covered with &s;mall &s;ilver, bra&s;s, and tin-plates, buttons, and large rings, &s;uch as they wear on their fingers, to which they hang again a percel of &s;mall ones, which make a jing|ling noi&s;e when they move. A maiden-bride has her hair plaited and hung as full as po&s;&s;ible with &s;uch kind of trinkets, as al&s;o her clothes. For this purpo&s;e they get all the ornaments they can.</P>
<P>The pea&s;ants are generally bu&s;ied in cutting wood,
<PB N="249" REF="031692_0572_0FEE7650B95181F8">
felling and floating timber, burning charcoal, and ex|tricating tar. Great numbers are employed in the mines, and at the furnaces and &s;tamping mills; and al&s;o in navigation and fi&s;hing, be&s;ides hunting and &s;hooting; for every body is at liberty to pur&s;ue the game, e&s;pecially in the mountains, where every pea&s;ant may make u&s;e of what arms he plea&s;es.</P>

<P>THEIR hou&s;es are, in general, built of fir and pine-trees, the whole trunks of which are only chop|ped even to make them lie clo&s;e, and then laid one up|on another, and fa&s;tened with mortices at the corners. The&s;e trunks are left round as they grew, both on the in&s;ide and out&s;ide of the hou&s;es, and are frequently boarded over and painted, e&s;pecially in the trading towns, which gives them a genteel appearance.</P>
<P>In the country villages the hou&s;es are built at a di&s;|tance from each other, with their fields and grounds

about them. The &s;tore-hou&s;e for the provi&s;ions is generally at a di&s;tance from the dwelling-hou&s;e, for fear of fire, and placed high upon poles, to keep the provi&s;ions dry and pre&s;erve them from mice and all kinds of vermin. The kitchen &s;tands al&s;o &s;eparate, as do the barns, hay-loft, cow-hou&s;es, &s;tables, and the like. A farm has likewi&s;e commonly a mill belonging to it, &s;ituated by &s;ome rivulet, be&s;ides a &s;mith's forge; for every farmer, as hath been ob&s;erved, is his own &s;mith. Up the country, where timber for building is but of little value, there is many a farm-hou&s;e as large as a nobleman's &s;eat. It is frequently two &s;tories high, and has a rai&s;ed balcony in the front. The additional building re&s;emble a little village. The common farm|hou&s;es have, however, only the ground-floor, and no other window but a &s;quare hole in the wall, which is left open in &s;ummer; but in winter, or in wet weather, is filled up with a wooden frame, covered with the in|ward membrane of &s;ome animal. This is very &s;trong, and as tran&s;parent as a bladder. This hole, which is as high as it can be placed, al&s;o an&s;wers the purpo&s;e of a chimney, by &s;erving to let out the &s;moke.</P>
<P>Under the light hole generally &s;tands a long thick table, with benches of the &s;ame wood, and at the upper end is the high &s;eat which belongs to the ma&s;ter only. In towns the&s;e hou&s;es are covered with tiles; but in the country, the people lay over the boards the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

<HEAD>SECT. XCV. OF THE ANIMALS OF NORWAY.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the animals we &s;hall begin with the hor|&s;es, which are better for riding than drawing. Their walk is ea&s;y, they are full of &s;pirit, and are very &s;ure footed. When they mount or de&s;cend a &s;teep cliff, on &s;tones like &s;teps, they fir&s;t tread gently with one foot, to try if the &s;tone they touch be fa&s;t; and in this they mu&s;t be left to them&s;elves, or the be&s;t rider will run the ri&s;k of his neck. But when they are to go down a very &s;teep and &s;lippery place, they, in a &s;urpri&s;ing manner draw their hind legs together under them, and &s;lide down. They &s;hew a great deal of courage in fighting with the wolves and bears, which they are often oblig|ed to do; for when the hor&s;e perceives any of them near him, and has a mare or gelding with him, he places them behind him, attacks his antagoni&s;t by &s;trik|ing
<PB N="252" REF="031692_0575_0FEE7657CCD078C8">
at him with his fore-legs, and u&s;ually comes off conqueror.</P>
<P>The Norway cows are generally of a yallow colour, as are al&s;o the hor&s;es. They are &s;mall, but their fle&s;h is fine grained, juicy, and well ta&s;ted.</P>
<P>The &s;heep here are &s;mall, and re&s;emble tho&s;e of Denmark. The goats, in many places, run wild, win|ter and &s;ummer, in the fields, till they are ten or twelve years old; and when the pea&s;ant, who owns them, is to catch them, he mu&s;t either do it by &s;ome &s;nare or &s;hoot them. They are &s;o bold, that if a wolf ap|proaches them, they &s;tay to receive him, and if they have dogs with them, they will re&s;i&s;t a whole herd. They frequently attack the &s;nakes, and when they are bit by them, not only kill their antagoni&s;ts, but eat them: after which they are never known to die of the bite, though they are ill for &s;everal days. The own|er warms their own milk, and wa&s;hes the &s;ore with it.</P>
<P>Near Ro&s;tad, is a flat and naked field on which no vegetable will grow. The &s;oil is almo&s;t white, with grey &s;tripes, and has &s;omewhat of &s;o peculiarly poi|&s;onous nature, that though all other animals may &s;afely pa&s;s over it, a goat or a kid no &s;ooner &s;ets its foot upon it, than it drops down, &s;tretches out its leg, its, tongue hangs out of its mouth, and it expires if it has not in&s;tant help.</P>
<P>There are a few hogs in Norway, and not many
<PB N="253" REF="031692_0576_0FEE7659537C0598">
of the common deer; but the hares, which in the cold &s;ea&s;on change from brown or grey to a &s;now white are very cheap in winter.</P>
<P>The hurtful bea&s;ts are the bears and wolves, the lynx, va&s;t numbers of white, red and black foxes, and the glutton, a creature which few other countries know any otherwi&s;e than by report. This animal receives its name from its voracious appetite. In &s;ize and &s;hape <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e has &s;ome re&s;emblance to a long-bodied dog, with thick legs, &s;harp claws and teeth. His colour is black, variegated with brown and yallowi&s;h &s;treaks. He has the boldne&s;s to attack every bea&s;t he can po&s;&s;ibly con|quer; and if he finds a carca&s;e &s;ix times as big as him|&s;elf, he does not leave off eating as long as there is a mouthful left. When thus gorged, he pre&s;&s;es and &s;queezes him&s;elf between two trees that &s;tand near to|gether, and thus empties him&s;elf of what he has not time to dige&s;t. As his &s;kin &s;hines like dama&s;k, and is covered with &s;oft hair, it is very precious. It is there|fore well worth the hunt&s;man's while to kill him with|out wounding his &s;kin, which is done by &s;hooting him with a bow and blunt arrows.</P>
<P>The marten is al&s;o hunted on account of its &s;kin, as are likewi&s;e the &s;quirrel and the ermine, both of which are therefore &s;hot with blunt arrows. I am in doubt whether the ermine be different in kind from the Da|ni&s;h wea&s;el. Its valuable &s;kin is of a beautiful white,
<PB N="254" REF="031692_0577_0FEE765AD9C8F7A8">
and it has a black &s;pot on the tail. The ermines run after <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> like cats, and drag away what they catch, particularly eggs, which are their nice&s;t delicacy.</P>
<P>As to the reptiles, there are neither land-&s;nakes nor toads beyond the temperate zone; and even tho&s;e &s;nakes on the extremities of the temperate climate, are le&s;s poi&s;onous than in more &s;outhern countries. Lizards are here of various colours, as brown, green, and &s;trip|ed. Tho&s;e that are green are found in the fields, and the others in the cracks and holes of rocks.</P>
<P>Among the fowls are mo&s;t of tho&s;e &s;een in the we&s;t of Europe, and &s;ome that &s;eem peculiar to this country; of which la&s;t, the mo&s;t remarkable is the farncolin, an excellent land bird, which &s;erves the Norwegians in|&s;tead of the phea&s;ant, its fle&s;h being white, firm, and of a delicious ta&s;te.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, there are here &s;uch incredible numbers of &s;ea and land fowls near the rocks on the &s;ea-&s;hore, that they &s;ometimes ob&s;cure the &s;ight of the heavens for many miles out at &s;ea; &s;o that one would imagine all the fowls of the univer&s;e were gathered together in one flock.</P>

<P>WE took a journey from the town of Varanger in|to the country of Lapland, to try whether any trade could be carried on with the pea&s;ants there.

We engaged three of the inhabitants of Varanger to attend us, both to &s;hew us the way, and to help to carry our goods and provi&s;ions to the next village. We followed them through woods, moun|tains, and valleys, without meeting any living creature, till about four o'clock in the afternoon, when we per|ceived two white bears of a prodigious &s;ize approach, as we thought, to devour us; but our guides ob&s;erving the terror we were in, bid us not be afraid, but only to have our arms ready for defence, in ca&s;e they ap|proached too near us.

<P><PB N="256" REF="031692_0579_0FEE765DE9085D30">
As we were de&s;cending a mountain about an hour before night, we perceived at the foot of it a dozen hou&s;es at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from each other, and a little beyond them a heard of bea&s;ts like &s;tags, which our guides told us were rein-deer. On our arrival at the village, our guides conducted us to a hut, when be|ing very weary, we were glad to re&s;t our&s;elves; for we had made a long journey in a very bad way, with our luggage on our backs, which tired and encumber|ed us.</P>
<P>We pre&s;ented our ho&s;t with a piece of roll tobacco, and he received it with extraordinary joy, a&s;&s;uring us, he had not had &s;o valuable a pre&s;ent in nine months before; and in return he brought out his brandy bot|tle, &s;ome rein-deer's fle&s;h dre&s;&s;ed without &s;alting, and &s;ome dried fi&s;h, which we gave to our guides, and &s;up|ped our&s;elves upon the provi&s;ions we had brought with us.

<P>In the morning we a&s;ked our ho&s;t if he had nothing to barter with us for cloth and tobacco.

<HEAD>SECT. XCVII. THE MANNER OF TRAVELLING IN SLED|GES DRAWN BY REIN-DEER.</HEAD>
<P>BEING de&s;irous of continuing our journey, we begged our ho&s;t to lend us &s;ome rein-deer to carry us farther up the country, to which he readily con&s;ented; and taking down a horn that hung up in his cottage, went out and blew it. Upon which fourteen or fifteen of tho&s;e animals came running towards the hut, &s;ix of which he immediately yoked to &s;ix &s;ledges. In one of them we put our merchandize and provi&s;ions; another we a&s;&s;igned to one of our guides who under&s;tood the language of the Mu&s;covite Laplanders, and that of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he Kilops, di&s;mi&s;&s;ing the two other inhabitants of Va|ranger,
<PB N="258" REF="031692_0581_0FEE76624763AD88">
after having fir&s;t paid them in tobacco for their trouble. We then put on our Lapland clothes, and each of us lying down in his &s;ledge, was covered with a bear's &s;kin. At the back of the &s;ledge were two girths made of rein-deer's &s;kin leather, in which we thru&s;t our arms up to the &s;houlders to keep our&s;elves &s;teady; and we had each a &s;tick with a &s;trong ferrel, in order to &s;upport the &s;ledge, if it &s;hould be in dan|ger of overturning again&s;t the &s;tumps of trees, or &s;tones lying in the way.</P>
<P>We were no &s;ooner ready to &s;et out, than our ho&s;t muttered &s;ome words in the ear of the rein-deer; and when I afterwards enquired of the guide what he ment by it, he gravely replied with the utmo&s;t &s;implicity, that it was to tell them whither they &s;hould carry us. Cu&s;tom, however, had made this muttering &s;o familiar to them, that when our ho&s;t had gone to all the &s;ix, they &s;et off with amazing &s;wiftne&s;s, and continued their pace over hills and dales without keeping any beaten path, till &s;even o'clock in the evening; when they brought us to a lage village &s;ituated between two mountains, on the borders of a great lake. Stopping at the fourth hou&s;e in the place, and beating the ground with their feet, the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e came with &s;ome of his &s;ervants to take us out of the &s;ledges, and unhar|ne&s;s our cattle, one of them bringing out a little juni|per can filled with brandy, of which he gave each of us
<PB N="259" REF="031692_0582_0FEE766792D29698">
a brimmer out of a larger ve&s;&s;el that was al&s;o made of juniper wood. This it &s;eems was to revive our &s;pirits, our guide having informed him, that we were frigh|tened at our being drawn &s;o &s;wiftly by the&s;e animals, having never been u&s;ed to that way of travelling.</P>
<P>The rein-deer is of the colour of the &s;tag, and is not much bigger. The horns of this animal are &s;ome|what higher than tho&s;e of the &s;tag, but more crooked, hairy, and not &s;o well furni&s;hed with branches. Of the milk of the females they make good butter and chee&s;e. The&s;e animals, indeed, con&s;titute the greate&s;t, and almo&s;t the only riches of the Finlaplanders. In Finmark, thare are va&s;t numbers of them both wild and tame, and many a man there has from &s;ix or eight hundred to a thou&s;and of the&s;e u&s;eful creatures which never come under cover. They follow him wherever he is plea&s;ed to ramble, and, when they are put to a &s;ledge, tran&s;port his goods from one place to another. They provide for them&s;elves, and live chiefly on mo&s;s, and on the buds and leaves of trees. They &s;upport them&s;elves on very little nouri&s;hment, and are neat, clean, and entertaining creatures.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that when the rein-deer &s;heds his horns, and others ri&s;e in their &s;tead, they appear at fir&s;t covered with a &s;kin; and till they are of a finger's length, are &s;o &s;oft, that they may be cut with a knife like a &s;au&s;age, and are delicate eating even raw; there|fore
<PB N="260" REF="031692_0583_0FEE766D1E5814E8">
the hunt&s;men, when far outin the country, and pinch|ed for want of food, eat them, and find that they &s;atis|fy both their hunger and thir&s;t. When the horn grows bigger, there breeds within the &s;kin a worm which eats away the root.</P>
<P>The rein-deer has over his eye-lids a kind of &s;kin, through which he peeps, when otherwi&s;e, in the hard &s;hows, he would be obliged to &s;hut his eyes in|tirely; a &s;ingular in&s;tance of the benevolence of the great Creator, in providing for the wants of each crea|ture, according to its de&s;tined manner of living.</P>
<P>When we got out of our &s;ledges, our ho&s;t conduct|ed us into his hut, which, like the re&s;t of the cottages in the place, was very &s;mall, low, and covered with the bark of trees, the light entering in at a hole at the top. The people here were clothed much like tho&s;e of Va|ranger, their apparel being of the &s;ame materials and make, but longer. The women were al&s;o dre&s;&s;ed in rein-deer &s;kins, with the hair outwards.</P>
<P>We gave our ho&s;t a piece of our roll tobacco, about two inches long, with which he was highly plea&s;ed, and in the mo&s;t hearty manner returned us his thanks. We al&s;o gave a piece, not quite &s;o long, to each of the inhabitants of the place to make them our friends, and the better to &s;ecure our&s;elves again&s;t their attempts; for they &s;eemed more uncivilized than tho&s;e we la&s;t dealt with. We again &s;upped on the provi&s;ions we had

St. Peter, to certify that he was a good Chri&s;tian, and ought to be admitted into heaven. At the head of the coffin was placed a picture of St. Nicholas, who was one of the &s;even deacons mentioned in the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, a Saint greatly reverenced in all parts of Mu&s;covy, where he is &s;uppo&s;ed to be a particular friend of the dead. On which account his picture is always fixed near a corp&s;e, in&s;tead of a crucifix. He is repre&s;ented in a pilgrim's habit, with a long robe, a broad girdle about his wai&s;t, and a &s;taff in his hand.</P>
<P>They al&s;o put into the coffin a rundlet of brandy, &s;ome dried fi&s;h and rein-deer veni&s;on to &s;upport the de|cea&s;ed on his journey. They then lighted &s;ome fir-tree roots, piled up at a convenient di&s;tance from the coffin, wept, howled, and made a variety of &s;trange ge&s;tures, a&s;&s;uming a thou&s;and different attitudes to &s;hew the extravagance of their &s;orrow.</P>
<P>When this noi&s;e and the&s;e ge&s;ticulations were over, they marched round the corp&s;e &s;everal times in pro|ce&s;&s;ion, a&s;king the decea&s;ed why he died? Whether he was angry with his wife? Whether he &s;tood in need of meat, drink, or clothes? Whether he had not &s;ucceed|ed when fi&s;hing, or had lo&s;t his game when hunting?

The wives of the Mu&s;co|vite Laplanders make clothes for them&s;elves, their hu&s;|bands, and their children, and at the edges they are all embroidered with that thread.

<P>While our ho&s;t was bu&s;ied about the funeral, we pulled out &s;ome of our provi&s;ions, and gave our landlady &s;ome of every &s;ort to ta&s;te. She liked them all, e&s;peci|ally the gingerbread; but having drank two or three gla&s;&s;es of brandy, withdrew to her place of confine|ment, for fear of her hu&s;band's return.

On the twenty-fir&s;t of December this work was begun. In this &s;ea&s;on the &s;un but ju&s;t &s;hewed it&s;elf above the ho|rizon towards noon; but the long twilights, the white|ne&s;s of the &s;now, and the meteors continually blazing in the &s;ky, furni&s;hed us light enough to work four or five hours every day.</P>
<P>We lodged at the hou&s;e of the Curate of O&s;wer-Tor|nea, and at eleven in the forenoon began our &s;urvey, attended by &s;o great an equipage, that the Laplanders, drawn by the novelty of the &s;ight, came down from the neighbouring mountains. We &s;eparated into two
<PB N="254" REF="031692_0589_0FEE768549E72418">
bands, each of which carried our rods of fir, each thir|ty feet long. I &s;hall &s;ay nothing of the fatigues and dangers of this operation. Judge what it mu&s;t be to walk in &s;now two feet deep, with heavy poles in our hands which we were obliged to be continually laying on the &s;now, and lifting again,&mdash;in a cold &s;o ex|treme, that whenever we would ta&s;te a little brandy, the only thing that could be kept liquid, our tongues and lips froze to the cup, and came away bloody;&mdash;in a cold that congealed the fingers of &s;ome of us, and threaten|ed us with &s;till more di&s;mal accidents. While the ex|tremities of our bodies were thus freezing, the re&s;t, through exce&s;&s;ive toil, was bathed in &s;weat. Brandy did not quench our thir&s;t; we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to deep wells dug through the ice, which were &s;hut almo&s;t as &s;oon as opened, and from which the water could &s;carcely be conveyed unfrozen to our lips. Thus were we forced to run the hazard of the dangerous con|tra&s;t which ice-water might produce in our heated bodies.</P>
<P>Our work however advanced apace; for &s;ix days labour brought it to within about five hundred toi&s;es, where we had not been able to plant our &s;takes &s;oon e|nough. Three of the Gentlemen therefore undertook this office, while the Abb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Outhier and I went upon a pretty extraordinary adventure.</P>
<P>We had la&s;t &s;ummer omitted an ob&s;ervation of &s;mall
<PB N="255" REF="031692_0590_0FEE7688112B5708">
moment. This was taking the height of an object that we made u&s;e of in mea&s;uring the top of Ava&s;axa: and to perform this, I undertook to go with a quad|rant to the top of the mountain, &s;o &s;crupulou&s;ly care|ful were we that nothing &s;hould be wanting to the per|fection of the work. Imagine a very high mountain, full of rocks, that lie hid in a prodigious quantity of &s;now, as well as their cavities, wherein you may &s;ink into a cru&s;t of &s;now as into an aby&s;s, and the under|taking will &s;carce appear po&s;&s;ible. Yet there are two ways of performing it; one by walking, or rather &s;li|ding along upon two &s;trait boards, eight feet in length, which the Finlanders and Laplanders u&s;e to keep them from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">inking into the &s;now. But this way of walking requires long practice. The other is by tru&s;ting your|&s;elf to a rein-deer u&s;ed to &s;uch journeys.</P>
<P>This fir&s;t part of our journey was performed in a moment; for our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">light over the plain beaten road from the curate's hou&s;e to the foot of the mountain can be compared only to that of birds. And though the mountain, where there was no track, greatly abated the &s;peed of our rein-deer, they got at length to the top of it, where we immediately made the ob&s;ervation for which we came. In the mean while our rein-deer had dug deep holes in the &s;now, where they browzed on the mo&s;s that covers the rocks; and the Laplanders had lighted a great fire, and we pre&s;ently joined them to
<PB N="256" REF="031692_0591_0FEE768C1FDC76B0">
warm our&s;elves. The cold was &s;o extreme, that the heat of the fire could reach only to a very &s;mall di&s;|tance. As the &s;now ju&s;t by it melted, it was immedi|ately froze again, forming a hearth of ice all round.</P>
<P>Our journey up hill had been painful; but now our concern was le&s;t our return &s;hould be too rapid. We were to proceed down the &s;teep in conveyances, which though partly &s;unk in the &s;now, &s;lid on notwith&s;tand|ing, drawn by animals, who&s;e fury in the plain we had already tried, and who, though &s;inking to their bel|lies in the &s;now, would endeavour to free them&s;elves by the &s;wiftne&s;s of their flight. We very &s;oon found our&s;elves at the bottom of the hill. The next day we fini&s;hed our &s;urvey, and made all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te back to Tornea, to &s;ecure our&s;elves in the be&s;t manner we were able from the increa&s;ing &s;everity of the &s;ea|&s;on.</P>
<P>The town of Tornea, at our arrival on the 30th of December, had really a mo&s;t frightful a&s;pect. Its little hou&s;es were buried to the tops in &s;now, which, had there been any day-light, mu&s;t have effectually &s;hut it out. But the &s;now continually falling, or ready to fall for the mo&s;t part hid the &s;un the few moments he might have appeared at mid-day.</P>
<P>In the month of January the cold was increa&s;ed to that extremity, that Mr. Reaumur's mercurial thermo|meters, which at Paris, in the great fro&s;t of 1709, it
<PB N="257" REF="031692_0592_0FEE7690307A6298">
was thought &s;trange to &s;ee fall to 14 degrees below the freezing point, were now got down to 37. The &s;pirit of wine in the others was frozen. If we opened the door of a warm room, the external air in&s;tantly con|verted all the vapour in it into &s;now, whirling it round in while vortexes. If we went abroad, we felt as if the air was tearing our brea&s;ts in pieces; and the crack|ing of the wood, of which the hou&s;es are built, as if it &s;plit by the violence of the fro&s;t, continually alarmed us with an increa&s;e of cold. The &s;olitude of the &s;treets was as great as if the people had been all dead. In this country you may often &s;ee people who have lo&s;t an arm or a leg by the fro&s;t. The cold, which is always very great, &s;ometimes increa&s;es by &s;uch violent and &s;udden fits, as are almo&s;t infallibly fatal to tho&s;e who are &s;o unhappy as to be expo&s;ed to it; and &s;ometimes there ri&s;e &s;udden tempe&s;ts of &s;now, which are &s;till more dangerous.</P>
<P>The winds &s;eem to blow from all quarters at once, and drive about the &s;now with &s;uch fury, that all the roads are in a moment rendered invi&s;ible. Dreadful is the &s;ituation of a per&s;on &s;urpri&s;ed in the fields by &s;uch a &s;torm. His knowledge of the country, and even the mark he may have taken by the trees, cannot avail him. He is blinded by the &s;now; and if he attempts to find his way home, is generally lo&s;t.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, during the whole winter the cold was &s;o
<PB N="258" REF="031692_0593_0FEE7691DE349AE0">
exce&s;&s;ive, that on the 7th of April, at five in the morn|ing, the thermometer was fallen to twenty divi&s;ions below the point of freezing, though every afternoon it ro&s;e two or three divi&s;ions above it; a difference in the height not much le&s;s than that which the greate&s;t heat and cold felt at Paris u&s;ually produce in that in&s;tru|ment. Thus, in the &s;pace of twenty-four hours, we had all the variety felt in the temparate zones in the compa&s;s of a whole year.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. C. OF THE BEAUTY OF THE NORTHERN LIGHTS IN LAPLAND.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH in this climate the earth is horrible, the heavens pre&s;ent mo&s;t beautiful pro&s;pects. The &s;hort days are no &s;ooner clo&s;ed, than fires of a thou&s;and colours and figures &s;ight up the &s;ky, as if de&s;igned to compen&s;ate for the ab&s;ence of the &s;un in this &s;ea|&s;on.

arch is often &s;een fixed towards the north, they &s;eem more frequently to po&s;&s;e&s;s the whole extent of the hemi&s;phere. Sometimes they begin in the form of a great &s;carf of bright light, with its extremities upon the horizon, which with a motion re&s;embling that of a fi&s;hing-net, glides &s;wiftly up the &s;ky, pre&s;erving in this motion a direction nearly perpendicular to the me|ridian; and mo&s;t commonly after tho&s;e preludes, all the lights unite at the zenith, and form the top of a kind of crown.

Their &s;ummits approach each other, and the di&s;tance of their extremities widens towards the hori|zon. I have &s;een &s;ome of the oppo&s;ite arcs, who&s;e &s;ummits almo&s;t join at the zenith; and both the one and the other have frequently &s;everal concentric arcs beyond it. Their tops are all placed in the direction of the meridian, though with a little declination to the we&s;t, which I did not find to be con&s;tant, and which is &s;ometimes &s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>It would be endle&s;s to mention all the different fig|ures the&s;e meteors a&s;&s;ume, and the various motions with which they are agitated. Their motion is mo&s;t com|monly like that of a pair of colours waved in the air, and the different tints of their light gives them the ap|pearance of &s;o many va&s;t &s;treamers of changeable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.

Sometimes they line a part of the &s;ky with &s;car|let.</P>
<P>On the 18th of December, I &s;aw a phaenomenon of this kind, that in the mid&s;t of all the wonders to which I was now every day accu&s;tomed, rai&s;ed my admira|tion. To the &s;outh a great &s;pace of the &s;ky appeared tinged with &s;o lively a red, that the whole con&s;tellation of Orion looked as if it had been dipped in blood. This light, which was at fir&s;t fixed, &s;oon moved, and changing into other colours, violet and blue, &s;ettled into a dome, who&s;e top &s;tood a little to the &s;outh-we&s;t of the zenith. The moon &s;hone bright, but did not in the lea&s;t efface it.</P>
<P>In this country, where there are lights of &s;o many different colours, I never &s;aw but two that were red; and &s;uch are taken for pre&s;ages of &s;ome great misfor|tune. After all, when people gaze at the&s;e phaenome|na with an unphilo&s;ophic eye, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing if they di&s;cover in them armies engaged, fiery chariots, and a thou&s;and other prodigies.</P>
<P>During the winter we repeated many of our ob&s;erva|tions, and calculations, and found the mo&s;t evident proofs of the earth's being flatted at the poles. Mean time the &s;un came nearer, or rather no more quitted us. It was now May, when it was curious enough to &s;ee that great luminary enlighten for &s;o long a time a whole horizon of ice, and to &s;ee &s;ummer in the heavens,

while winter &s;till kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the earth. We were in the morning of that long day of &s;everal months; yet the &s;un, with all his power, wrought no change either upon the ice or &s;now.</P>
<P>On the 6th of May it began to rain, and &s;ome water appeared on the ice of the river. At noon a little &s;now melted, but in the evening winter re&s;umed his rights. At length, on the 10th, the earth which had been &s;o long hid, began to appear; &s;ome high points that were expo&s;ed to the &s;un &s;howed them&s;elves, as the tops of the mountains did after the deluge, and all the fowls of the country returned. At the beginning of June, win|ter yielding up the earth and &s;ea, we prepared for our departure back to Stockholm, and on the 9th, &s;ome of us &s;et out by land, and others by &s;ea.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. CI. OF ST. ANDREWS IN SCOTLAND.</HEAD>
<P>I HAD de&s;ired to vi&s;it the Hebrides, or We&s;tern I&s;l|ands of Scotland &s;o long, that I &s;carcely remember how the wi&s;h was originally excited; and was in the Autumn of the year 1773 induced to undertake the journey, by finding in Mr. Bo&s;well a companion, who&s;e accutene&s;s would help my enquiry, and who&s;e gaiety of conver&s;ation and civility of manners are &s;ufficient to counteract the inconveniences of travel, in countries le&s;s ho&s;pitable than we have pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>On the 18th of Augu&s;t we left Edinburgh, a city too well known to admit de&s;cription, and directed our cour&s;e northward, along the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of Scotland, accompanied the fir&s;t day by another gentleman, who could &s;tay with us only long enough to &s;how us how much we lo&s;t at &s;eparation.</P>
<P>As we cro&s;&s;ed the Frith of Fourth, our curio&s;ity was attracted by <HI>Inch Keith,</HI> a &s;mall i&s;land, which neither of my companions had ever vi&s;ited, though, lying with|in their view, it had all their lives &s;olicited their no|tice. Here, by climbing with &s;ome difficulty over
<PB N="263" REF="031692_0598_0FEE769C26774E28">
&s;hattered crags, we made the fir&s;t experiment of unfre|quented coa&s;ts. Inch Kieth is nothing more than a rock covered with a thin layer of earth, not wholly bare of gra&s;s, and very fertile of thi&s;tles. A &s;mall herd of cows graze annually upon it in the &s;ummer. It &s;eems never to have afforded to man or bea&s;t a perma|nent habitation.</P>
<P>We left this little i&s;land with our thoughts employed a while on the different appearance that it would have made if it had been placed at the &s;ame di&s;tance from London, with the &s;ame facility of appoach; with what emulation of price a few rocky acres would have been purcha&s;ed, and with what expen&s;ive indu&s;try they would have been cultivated and adorned.</P>
<P>When we landed, we found our chai&s;e ready, and pa&s;&s;ed throug <HI>Kinghorn, Kirkaldy,</HI> and <HI>Cowpar,</HI> places not unlike the &s;mall trading market-towns in tho&s;e parts of England where commerce and manufactures have not yet produced opulence.</P>
<P>Though we were yet in the mo&s;t populous part of Scotland, and at &s;o &s;mall a di&s;tance from the capital, we met few pa&s;&s;engers.</P>
<P>The roads are neither rough nor dirty; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it af|fords a &s;outhern &s;tranger a new kind of plea&s;ure to travel &s;o commodiou&s;ly without the interruption of toll|gates.</P>
<P>At an hour &s;omewhat late, we came to St. Andrews,
<PB N="264" REF="031692_0599_0FEE769F10F8D940">
a city once archiepi&s;copal; where that univer&s;ity &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in which philo&s;ophy was formerly taught by Buchanan, who&s;e name has as fair a claim to immortali|ty as can be conferred by modern latinity, and perhaps a fairer than the in&s;tability of vernacular languages ad|mits.</P>
<P>We found, that by the interpo&s;ition of &s;ome invi&s;ible friend, lodgings had been provided for us at the hou&s;e of one of the profe&s;&s;ors, who&s;e ea&s;y civility quickly made us forget that we were &s;trangers; and in the whole time of our &s;tay we were gratified by every mode of kindne&s;s, and entertained with all the elegance of lettered ho&s;pitality.</P>
<P>In the morning we aro&s;e to perambulate a city, which only hi&s;tory &s;hows to have once flouri&s;hed, and &s;ur|veyed the ruins of ancient magnificence, of which e|ven the ruins cannot long be vi&s;ible, unle&s;s &s;ome care be taken to pre&s;erve them; and where is the plea&s;ure of pre&s;erving &s;uch mournful memorials? They have been, till very lately, &s;o much neglected, that every man carried away the &s;tones who fancied that he want|ed them.</P>
<P>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, of which the foundation may be &s;till traced, and a &s;mall part of the wall is &s;tanding, appears to have been a &s;pacious and maje&s;tic building, and not un&s;uitable to the primacy of the kingdom. Of the architecture, the poor remains can hardly exhibit,

even to an arti&s;t, a &s;ufficient &s;pecimen. It was demo|li&s;hed, it is well known, in the tumult and violence of Knox's reformation.</P>
<P>Not far from the Cathedral, on the margin of the water, &s;tands a fragment of the ca&s;tle, in which the arch|bi&s;hop anciently re&s;ided.

<P>The change of religion in Scotland, eager and ve|hement as it was, rai&s;ed an epidemical <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nthu&s;ia&s;m, compounded of &s;ullen &s;crupulou&s;ne&s;s and warlike fe|rocity, which, in a people whom idlene&s;s re&s;igned to their own thoughts, and who conver&s;ing only with each other, &s;uffered no dilution of their zeal from the gradual influx of new opinions, was long tran&s;mit|ted in its full &s;trength from the old to the young, but by trade and intercour&s;e with England, is now vi&s;ibly abating, and giving way too fa&s;t to that laxity of practice and indifference of opinion, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> which men, not &s;ufficiently in&s;tructed to find the middle point, too ea&s;ily &s;helter them&s;elves from rigour and con|&s;traint.</P>

pre-eminence, gradually decayed. One of its &s;treets is now lo&s;t; and in tho&s;e that remain, there is the &s;ilence and &s;olitude of inactive indigence and gloomy depopulation.</P>
<P>The univer&s;ity, within a few years, con&s;i&s;ted of three colleges, but is now reduced to two; the college of St. Leonard being lately di&s;&s;olved by the &s;ale of its buildings and the appropriation of its revenues to the profe&s;&s;ors of the two others. The chapel of the aliena|ted college is yet &s;tanding, a fabric not inelegant of ex|ternal &s;tructure; but I was always, by &s;ome civil ex|cu&s;e, hindered from entering it. A decent attempt, as I was &s;ince told, has been made to convert it into a kind of green hou&s;e, by planting its area with &s;hrubs. This new method of gardening is un&s;ucce&s;sful: the plants do not hitherto pro&s;per. To what u&s;e it will next be put, I have no plea&s;ure in conjecturing. It is &s;omething that its pre&s;ent &s;tate is at lea&s;t not o&s;ten|tatiou&s;ly di&s;played. Where there is yet &s;hame, there may in time be virtue.</P>
<P>The di&s;&s;olution of St. Leonard's College was doubt|le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary&punc; but of that nece&s;&s;ity there is rea&s;on to complain. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> is &s;urely not without ju&s;t reproach, that a nation, of which the commerce is hourly extending and the wealth increa&s;ing, denies any participation of its pro&s;perity to its literary &s;ocieties; and while its
<PB N="279" REF="031692_0602_0FEE76A4F01A0E70">
merchants or its nobles are rai&s;ing palaces, &s;uffers its univer&s;ities to moulder into du&s;t.</P>
<P>Of the two colleges yet &s;tanding, one is by the in&s;ti|tution of its founder appropriated to divinity. It is &s;aid to be capable of containing fifty &s;tudents; but more than one mu&s;t occupy a chamber. The library, which is of late erection, is not very &s;pacious, but ele|gant and luminous.</P>
<P>The doctor, by whom it was &s;hown, hoped to irri|tate or &s;ubdue my Engli&s;h vanity, by telling me, that we had no &s;uch repo&s;itory of books in England.</P>
<P>St. Andrews &s;eems to be a place eminently adapted to &s;tudy and education, being &s;ituated in a populous, yet a cheap country, and expo&s;ing the minds and man|ners of young men neither to the levity and di&s;&s;olute|ne&s;s of a capital city, nor to the gro&s;s luxury of a town of commerce, places naturally unpropitious to learn|ing. In one the de&s;ire of knowledge ea&s;ily gives way to the love of plea&s;ure, and in the other, is in danger of yielding to the love of money.</P>
<P>The &s;tudents however are repre&s;ented as at this time not exceeding a hundred. Perhaps it may be &s;ome ob|&s;truction to their increa&s;e, that there is no Epi&s;copal chapel in the place. I &s;aw no rea&s;on for imputing their paucity to the pre&s;ent profe&s;&s;ors; nor can the ex|pence of an academical education be very rea&s;onably objected. A &s;tudent of the highe&s;t cla&s;s may keep his

annual &s;e&s;&s;ion, or as the Engli&s;h call it, his term, which la&s;ts &s;even months, for about fifteen pounds, and one of lower rank for le&s;s than ten; in which board, lodging, and in&s;truction are all included.</P>
<P>The chief magi&s;trate re&s;ident in the univer&s;ity, an|&s;wering to our vice-chancellor, and to the <HI>rector magni|ficus</HI> on the continent, had commonly the title of Lord Rector; but being addre&s;&s;ed only as <HI>Mr. Rector</HI> in an inauguratory &s;peech by the pre&s;ent chancellor, he has fallen from his former dignity of &s;tyle. Lord&s;hip was very liberally annexed by our ance&s;tors to any &s;tation or character of dignity. They &s;aid, the <HI>Lord General</HI> and <HI>Lord Amba&s;&s;ador;</HI> &s;o we &s;till &s;ay, <HI>my Lord,</HI> to the judge upon the circuit, and yet retain in our Liturgy <HI>the Lords of the Council.</HI></P>
<P>In walking among the ruins of religious buildings, we came to two vaults, over which had formerly &s;tood the hou&s;e of the &s;ub-prior. One of the vaults was in|habited by an old woman, who claimed the right of a|bode there, and the widow of a man who&s;e ance&s;tors had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the &s;ame gloomy man&s;ion for no le&s;s than four generations. The right, however it begun, was con&s;idered as e&s;tabli&s;hed by legal pre&s;cription, and the old woman lives undi&s;turbed. She thinks however that &s;he has a claim to &s;omething more than &s;ufferance; for as her hu&s;band's name was Bruce, &s;he is allied to royality, and told Mr. Bo&s;well, that when there were
<PB N="281" REF="031692_0604_0FEE76AA91452480">
per&s;ons of quality in the place, &s;he was di&s;tingu&s;hed by &s;ome notice; that indeed &s;he is now neglected, but &s;he &s;pins a thread, has the company of her cat, and is trou|ble&s;ome to nobody.</P>
<P>Having now &s;een whatever this ancient city offered to our curio&s;ity, we left it with good wi&s;hes, having rea&s;on to be highly plea&s;ed with the attention that was paid us. But whoever &s;urveys the world mu&s;t &s;ee ma|ny things that give him pain. The kindne&s;s of the profe&s;&s;ors did not contribute to abate the unea&s;y re|membrance of an univer&s;ity declining, a college alien|ated, and a church profaned and ha&s;tening to the ground.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. CII. OF INVERNESS.</HEAD>
<P>INVERNES may properly be called the capital of the Highlands. Hither the inhabitants of the inland parts come to be &s;upplied with what they cannot make for them&s;elves. Hither the young nymphs of, the mountains and valleys are &s;ent for education, and as far as my ob&s;ervation has reached are not &s;ent in vain.</P>
<P>Inverne&s;s was the la&s;t place which had a regular com|munication by high roads with the &s;outhern counties. All the ways beyond it have, I believe, been made by the &s;oldiers in this century. At Inverne&s;s therefore Cromwell, when he &s;ubdued Scotland, &s;tationed a gar|ri&s;on, as at the boundary of the Highlands. The &s;oldiers &s;eem to have incorporated afterwards with the inhabitants, and to have peopled the place with an En|gli&s;h race; for the language of this town has been long con&s;idered as particularly elegant.</P>
<P>Here is a ca&s;tle, called the ca&s;tle of Macbeth, the walls of which are yet &s;tanding. It was no very capa|cious edifice, but &s;tands upon a rock &s;o high and &s;teep, that I think it was once not acce&s;&s;ible, but by the
<PB N="283" REF="031692_0606_0FEE76B16838A568">
help of ladders or a bridge. Oppo&s;ite to it, on anoth|er hill, was a fort built by Cromwell, now totally de|moli&s;hed; for no faction of Scotland loved the name of Cromwell, or had any de&s;ire to continue his memo|ry.</P>
<P>Yet what the Romans did to other nations, was in a great degree done by Cromwell to the Scots. He civi|lized them by conque&s;t, and introduced by u&s;eful vio|lence the arts of peace. I was told at Aberdeen, that the people learned from Cromwell's &s;oldiers to make &s;hoes and to plant kail.</P>
<P>How they lived without kail, it is not ea&s;y to gue&s;s. They cultivated hardly any other plant for common tables, and when they had not kail, they probably had nothing. The numbers that go barefoot are &s;till &s;uf|ficient to &s;how that &s;hoes may be &s;pared. They are not yet con&s;idered as nece&s;&s;aries of life; for tall boys, not otherwi&s;e meanly dre&s;&s;ed, run without them in the &s;treets and in the i&s;lands. The &s;ons of gentlemen pa&s;s &s;everal of the fir&s;t years with naked feet.</P>
<P>I know not whether it be not peculiar to the Scots to have attained the liberal, without the manual arts; to have excelled in ornamental knowledge, and to have wanted not only the elegancies, but the conveniencies of common life. Literature &s;oon after its revival found its way to Scotland, and from the middle of the &s;ixteenth century, almo&s;t to the middle of the &s;even|teenth,
<PB N="284" REF="031692_0607_0FEE76BB0C290D68">
the politer &s;tudies were very dilligently pur&s;ued. The Latin poetry of <HI>Delici<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Poetorum Scotorum</HI> would have done honour to any nation; at lea&s;t till the pub|lication of <HI>May's Supplement,</HI> the Engli&s;h had very little to oppo&s;e.</P>
<P>Yet men thus ingenious and inqui&s;itive were con|tent to live in total ignorance of the trade by which human wants are &s;upplied, and to &s;upply them by the gro&s;&s;e&s;t means. Till the Union made them acquaint|ed with Engli&s;h manners, the culture of their lands was un&s;kilful, and their dome&s;tic life uninformed.</P>
<P>Since they have known that their condition was ca|pable of improvement, their progre&s;s in u&s;eful know|ledge has been rapid and uniform. What remains to be done they will quickly do, and then wonder, like me, why that which was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary and &s;o ea&s;y was &s;o long delayed. But they mu&s;t be forever content to owe to the Engli&s;h that elegance and culture, which, if they had been vigilant and active, perhaps the Engli&s;h might have owed to them.</P>
<P>Here the appearance of life began to alter. I had &s;een a few women with plaids at Aberdeen; but at In|verne&s;s, the Highland manners are common. There is I think a kirk, in which only the er&s;e language is u&s;ed. There is likewi&s;e an Engli&s;h chapel, but mean|ly built, where on Sunday we &s;aw a very decent con|gregation.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="031692_0608_0FEE76C0BA98C350">
We were now to bid farewell to the luxury of tra|velling, and to enter a country upon which perhaps no wheel has ever rolled. We could indeed have u&s;ed our po&s;t-chai&s;e one day longer, along the military road to fort Augu&s;tus, but we could have hired no hor&s;es beyond Inverne&s;s, and we were not &s;o &s;paring of our|&s;elves as to lead them, merely that we might have one day longer the indulgence of a carriage. At Inver|ne&s;s therefore we procured three hor&s;es for our&s;elves and a &s;ervant and one more for our baggage, which was no very heavy load. We found in the cour&s;e of our journey the convenience of having di&s;encumbered our&s;elves, by laying a&s;ide whatever we could &s;pare; for it is not to be imagined without experience, how in climbing crags, and treading bogs, and winding through narrow and ob&s;tructed pa&s;&s;ages, a little bulk will hinder, and a little weight will burden; or how often a man that has plea&s;ed him&s;elf at home with his own re&s;olution, will, in the hour of darkne&s;s and fa|tigue, be content to leave behind him every thing but him&s;elf.</P>
<P>We took two Highlanders to turn be&s;ide us, partly to &s;how us the way, and partly to take back from the &s;ea-&s;ide the hor&s;es, of which they were the owners. One of them was a man of great liveline&s;s and activity, of whom his companion &s;aid, that he would tire any hor&s;e in Inverne&s;s. Both of them were civil and rea|dy-handed.
<PB N="286" REF="031692_0609_0FEE76C4EA0A96A8">
Civility &s;eems part of the national cha|rcter of the Highlanders. Every chieftain is a monarch, and politene&s;s, the natural product of royal gov|ernment, is diffu&s;ed from the laird through the whole clan. But they are not commonly dextrous. Their narrowne&s;s of life confines them to a few operations, and they are accu&s;tomed to endure little wants more than to remove them.</P>
<P>We mounted our &s;teeds on the thirteenth of Augu&s;t, and directed our guides to conduct us to Fort Augu&s;tus. It is built at the head of Lough Ne&s;s, of which Inver|ne&s;s &s;tands at the outlet. The way between them has been cut by the &s;oldiers, and the greater part of it runs along a rock, levelled with great labour and exactne&s;s near the water-&s;ide.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of this day's journey was very plea&s;ant. The day, though bright, was not hot; and the appearance of the country, if I had not &s;een the Peak, would have been wholly new. We went upon a &s;urface &s;o hard and level, that we had little care to hold the bridle, and were therefore at full lei&s;ure for contemplation. On the left were high and &s;teep rocks &s;haded with birch, the hardy native of the North, and covered with fern or heath. On the right the limped waters of Lough Ne&s;s were beating their bank, and waving their &s;ur|face by a gentle agitation. Beyond them were rocks &s;ometimes covered with verdure, and &s;ometimes tower|ing
<PB N="287" REF="031692_0610_0FEE76C9231BDE88">
in horrid nakedne&s;s. Now and then we e&s;pied a little corn-field, which &s;erved to impre&s;s more &s;trongly the general barrenne&s;s.</P>
<P>Lough Ne&s;s is about twenty-four miles long, and from one to two miles abroad. It is remarkable that Boethius, in his de&s;cription of Scotland, gives it twelve miles of breadth. When hi&s;torians or geographers ex|hibit fal&s;e accounts of places far di&s;tant, they may be forgiven, becau&s;e they can tell but what they are told; and that their accounts exceed the truth may be ju&s;t|ly &s;uppo&s;ed, becau&s;e mo&s;t men exaggerate to others, if not to them&s;elves. But Boethius lived at no great di&s;|tance. If he never &s;aw the lake he mu&s;t have been very incurious, and if he had &s;een it, his veracity yielded to very &s;light temptations.</P>
<P>Lough Ne&s;s, though not twelve miles abroad, is a very remarkable diffu&s;&s;ion of water without i&s;lands. It fills a large hollow between two ridges of high rocks, being &s;upplyed partly by the torrents which fall into it on either &s;ide, and partly, as is &s;uppo&s;ed, by &s;prings at the bottom. Its water is remarkably clear and plea|&s;ant, and is imagined by the natives to be medicinal. We were told, that it is in &s;ome places one hundred and forty fathoms deep, a profundity &s;carcely credible, and which probably tho&s;e that relate it have never &s;ounded. Its fi&s;h are &s;almon, trout, and pike.</P>
<P>It was &s;aid at Fort Augu&s;tus, that Lough Ne&s;s is o|pen
<PB N="288" REF="031692_0611_0FEE76CD51744300">
in the harde&s;t winters, thoug a lake not far from it is covered with ice. In di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the&s;e exceptions from the cour&s;e of nature, the fir&s;t que&s;tion is whether the fact be ju&s;tly &s;tated. That which is &s;trange is de|lightful, and a plea&s;ing error is not willingly detected. Accuracy of narration is not very common, and there are few &s;o rigidly philo&s;ophical as not to repre&s;ent as perpetual what is only frequent, or as con&s;tant, what is really ca&s;ual. If it be true that Lough Ne&s;s never freezes, it is either &s;heltered by its high banks from the cold bla&s;ts and expo&s;ed only to tho&s;e winds which have more power to agitate than congeal: or it is kept in perpetual motion by the ru&s;h of &s;treams from the rocks that inclo&s;e it. Its profundity, though it &s;hould be &s;uch as is repre&s;ented, can have little part in this exemption; for though deep wells are not frozen, be|cau&s;e their waters are excluded from the external air, yet where a wide &s;urface is expo&s;ed to the full influence of a freezing atmo&s;phere, I know not why the depth &s;hould keep it open. Natural philo&s;ophy is now one of the favourite &s;tudies of the Scotch nation, and Lough Ne&s;s well de&s;erves to be diligently examined.</P>
<P>The road on which we travelled, and which was it&s;elf a &s;ource of entertainment, is made along the rock, in the direction of the lough, &s;ometimes by breaking off protuberances, and &s;ometimes by cutting the great ma&s;s of &s;tone to a con&s;iderable depth. The fragments
<PB N="289" REF="031692_0612_0FEE76CED83A02D8">
are piled in a loo&s;e wall on either &s;ide, with apertures left at very &s;hort &s;paces, to give a pa&s;&s;age to the wintry currents. Part of it is bordered with low trees, from which our guides gathered nuts, and would have had the appearance of an Engli&s;h lane, except that an En|gli&s;h lane is almo&s;t always dirty. It has been made with great labour, but has this advantage, that it can|not, without equal labour, be broken up.</P>
<P>Within our &s;ight there were goats feeding or play|ing. The mountains have red deer, but they came not within view; and if what is &s;aid of their vigilance and &s;ubtlety be true, they have &s;ome claim to that palm of wi&s;dom, which the ea&s;tern philo&s;opher, whom Alex|ander interrogated, gave to tho&s;e bea&s;ts which live far|the&s;t from men.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. CIII. DESCRIPTION OF A HIGHLAND COTTAGE.</HEAD>
<P>NEAR the way, by the water &s;ide we e&s;pied a cot|tage. This was the fir&s;t Highland Hut that I had &s;een; and as our bu&s;ine&s;s was with life and manners, we were willing to vi&s;it it. To enter a habitation without leave, &s;eems to be con&s;idered here as rudene&s;s or intru&s;ion. The old laws of ho&s;pitality &s;till give this licence to a &s;tranger.</P>
<P>A hut is con&s;tructed with loo&s;e &s;tones, ranged for the mo&s;t part with &s;ome tendency to circularity. It mu&s;t be placed where the wind cannot act upon it with vio|lence, becau&s;e it has no cement; and where the water will run ea&s;ily away, becau&s;e it has no floor but the naked ground. The wall, which is commonly about &s;ix feet high, declines from the perpendicular a little in ward. Such rafters as can be procured are then rai&s;ed for a roof, and covered with heath, which makes a &s;trong and warm thatch, kept from flying off by ropes of twi&s;ted heath, of which the ends, reaching from the centre of the thatch to the top of the wall, are held firm by the weight of a large &s;tone. No light is admit|ted but at the entrance, and through a hole in the
<PB N="291" REF="031692_0614_0FEE76D322B68538">
thatch, which gives vent to the &s;moke. This hole is not directly over the fire, le&s;t the rain &s;hould extingui&s;h it; and the &s;moke therefore naturally fills the place before it e&s;capes. Such is the general &s;tructure of the hou&s;es in which one of the natives of this opulent and powerful i&s;land has been hitherto content to live. Huts however are not more uniform than palaces; and this which we were in&s;pecting was very far from one of the meane&s;t, for it was divided into &s;everal apart|ments; and its inhabitants po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch property as a pa&s;toral poet might exalt into riches.</P>
<P>When we entered we found an an old woman boil|ing goat's-fle&s;h in a kettle. She &s;poke little Engli&s;h, but we had interpreters at hand; and &s;he was willing enough to di&s;play her whole &s;y&s;tem of oeconomy. She has five children, of which none are yet gone from her. The elde&s;t, a boy of thirteen, and her hu&s;band, who is eighty years old, were at work in the wood. Her two next &s;ons were gone to Inverne&s;s to buy meal, by which oatmeal is always meant. Meal &s;he con&s;id|ered as expen&s;ive food, and told us, that in &s;pring when the goats gave milk, the children could live with|out it. She is mi&s;tre&s;s of &s;ixty goats, and I &s;aw many kids in an enclo&s;ure at the end of her hou&s;e. She had al&s;o &s;ome poultry. By the lake we &s;aw a potatoe-gar|den, and a &s;mall &s;pot of ground on which &s;tood four &s;hucks, containing each twelve &s;heaves of barley. She
<PB N="292" REF="031692_0615_0FEE76D4AA0EF3D8">
has all this from the labour of their own hands, and for what is nece&s;&s;ary to be bought, her kids and her chic|kens are &s;ent to market.</P>
<P>With the true pa&s;toral ho&s;pitality, &s;he a&s;ked us to &s;it down and drink whi&s;ky. She is religious, and though the kirk is four miles off, probably eight Engli&s;h miles, &s;he goes thither every Sunday. We gave her a &s;hilling and &s;he begged &s;nuff; for &s;nuff is the luxury of a High|land cottage.</P>
<P>Soon afterwards we came to the <HI>General's Hut,</HI> &s;o cal|led becau&s;e it was the temporary abode of Wade, while he &s;uperintended the works upon the road. It is now a hou&s;e of entertainment for pa&s;&s;engers, and we found it not ill &s;tocked with provi&s;ions.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. CIV. OF THE CLIMATE, SOIL, PRODUCE, AND ANIMALS OF THE HEBRIDES, PAR|TICULARLY OF SKY.</HEAD>
<P>AS the i&s;land of Sky lies in the fifty-&s;eventh degree, the air cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to have much warmth.
<PB N="293" REF="031692_0616_0FEE76D62F9B8FA0">
The long continuance of the &s;un above the horizon, does indeed &s;ometimes produce great heat in the northern lati|tudes; but this can only happen in &s;heltered places, where the atmo&s;phere is to a certain degree &s;tagnant, and the &s;ame ma&s;s of air continues to receive for many hours the rays of the &s;un, and the vapours of the earth. Sky lies open on the we&s;t and north to a va&s;t extent of ocean, and is cooled in the &s;ummer by perpetual ven|tilation, but by the &s;ame bla&s;ts is kept warm in winter. Their weather is not plea&s;ing. Half the year is delu|ged with rain. From the autumnal to the vernal equi|nox, a dry day is hardly known, except when the &s;howers are &s;u&s;pended by a tempe&s;t. Under &s;uch &s;kies can be expected no great exuberance of vegetation. Their winter overtakes their &s;ummer, and their harve&s;t lies upon the ground drenched with rain. The au|tumn &s;truggles hard to produce &s;ome of our early fruits. I gathered goo&s;eberries in September; but they were &s;mall, and the hu&s;k was thick.</P>
<P>Their winter is &s;eldom &s;uch as puts a full &s;top to the growth of plants, or reduces the cattle to live whol|ly on the &s;urplu&s;age of the &s;ummer. In the year &s;even|ty-one they had a &s;evere &s;ea&s;on, remembered by the name of the Black &s;pring, from which the i&s;land has not yet recovered. The &s;now lay long upon the ground, a calamity hardly known before. Part of their
<PB N="294" REF="031692_0617_0FEE76D7B7450858">
cattle died for w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nt, and part were un&s;ea&s;onably &s;old to buy &s;u&s;tenance for the owners.</P>
<P>The &s;oil, as in other countries, has its diver&s;ities. In &s;ome parts there is only a thin layer of earth &s;pread upon a rock, which bears nothing but &s;hort brown heath, and perhaps is not generally capable of any bet|ter product. There are many bogs or mo&s;&s;es of great|er or le&s;s extent, where the &s;oil cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to want depth, though it is too wet for the plough. But we did not ob&s;erve in the&s;e any aquatic plants. The vallies and the mountains are alike darkened with heath. Some gra&s;s however, grows here and there, and &s;ome happier &s;pots of earth are capable of tillage.</P>
<P>Their agriculture is laborious, and perhaps rather feeble than un&s;kilful. Their chief manure is &s;ea-weed, which, when they lay it to rot upon the field, gives them a better crop than tho&s;e of the Highlands. They heap &s;ea &s;hells upon the dunghill, which in time moul|der into a fertilizing &s;ub&s;tance. When they find a vein of earth where they cannot u&s;e it, they dig it up, and add it to the mould of a more commodious place. Their corn grounds often lie in &s;uch intricacies among the craggs, that there is no room for the action of a team and plough. The &s;oil is then turned up by man|ual labour, with an in&s;trument called a crooked &s;pade, of a forth and weight which to me appeared very
<PB N="295" REF="031692_0618_0FEE76DA95AA7688">
incommodious, and would perhaps be &s;oon improved in a country where workmen could be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> found and ea&s;ily paid. It has a narrow blade of iron fixed to a long and heavy piece of wood, which mu&s;t have, about a foot and a half above the iron, a knee or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with the angle downwards. When the farmer encounters a &s;tone, which is the great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of his opera|tions, he drives this blade under it, and bringing the knee or angle to the ground, his in the long handle a very forcible lever.</P>
<P>According to the different modes of tillage, farms are di&s;tingui&s;hed into <HI>long land and &s;hort land.</HI> Long land is that which affords room for a plough, and &s;hort land is turned up by the &s;pade.</P>
<P>The grain which they commit to the furrows thus tediou&s;ly formed, is either oats or barley. They do not &s;ow barley, without very copious manure, and then they expect from it, ten for one, an increa&s;e e|qual to that of better countries; but the culture is &s;o opero&s;e, that they content them&s;elves commonly with oats; and who can relate without compa&s;&s;ion, that af|ter all their diligence, they are to expect only a triple increa&s;e? It is in vain to hope for plenty, when a third part of the harve&s;t mu&s;t be re&s;erved for &s;eed.</P>
<P>When their grain is arrived at the &s;tate, which they mu&s;t con&s;ider as ripene&s;s, they do not cut, but pull the barley. To the oats they apply the &s;ickle. Wheel
<PB N="296" REF="031692_0619_0FEE76DC1B00B458">
carriages they have none, but make a frame of timber, which is drawn by one hor&s;e, with the two points behind pre&s;&s;ing on the ground. On this they &s;ometimes drag home their &s;heaves, but often convey them home in a kind of open panier, or frame of &s;ticks upon the hor&s;e's back.</P>
<P>Of that which is obtained with &s;o much difficulty, nothing &s;urely ought to be wa&s;ted; yet their method of clearing their oats from the hu&s;k is by parching them in the &s;traw. Thus with the genuine improvi|dence of &s;avages, they de&s;troy that fodder for want of which their cattle may peri&s;h. From this practice they have but two petty conveniences. They dry the grain &s;o that it is ea&s;ily reduced to meal, and they e&s;|cape the theft of the thre&s;her. The ta&s;te contracted from the fire by the oats, as by every other &s;corched &s;ub&s;tance, u&s;e mu&s;t long ago have made grateful. The oats that are parched mu&s;t be dried in a kiln.</P>
<P>Of their gardens I can judge only from their tables. I did not ob&s;erve that the common greens were want|ing, and &s;uppo&s;e, that by choo&s;ing an advantageous po&s;ition, they can rai&s;e all the more hardy e&s;culent plants. Of vegetable fragrance or beauty they are not yet &s;tudious. Few vows are made to Flora in the He|brides. They gather a little hay, but the gra&s;s is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">own late; and is &s;o often almo&s;t dry and again very wet, before it is hou&s;ed, that it becomes a collection of
<PB N="297" REF="031692_0620_0FEE76DEE80861F0">
withered &s;talks without ta&s;te or fragrance. It mu&s;t be eaten by cattle that have nothing el&s;e, but by mo&s;t Engli&s;h farmers would be thrown away.</P>
<P>In the i&s;lands I have not heard that any &s;ubterrane|ous trea&s;ures have been di&s;covered, though where there are mountains there are commonly minerals. One of the rocks in <HI>Col</HI> has a black vein, imagined to con&s;i&s;t of the ore of lead: but it was never yet opened or e&s;|&s;ayed. In <HI>Sky</HI> a black ma&s;s was accidentally picked up and brought into the hou&s;e of the owner of the land, who found him&s;elf &s;trongly inclined to think it a coal, but unhappily it did not burn in the chimney. Common ores would be here of no great value; for what requires to be &s;eparated by fire, mu&s;t, if it were found, be carried away in its mineral &s;tate, here being no fuel for the &s;melting-hou&s;e, or forge. Perhaps by diligent &s;earch in this world of &s;tone, &s;ome valua|ble &s;pecies of marble might be di&s;covered. But neither philo&s;ophical curio&s;ity, nor commercial indu&s;try, have yet fixed their abode here, where the importunity of immediate want &s;upplied but for the day, and crav|ing on the morrow, has left little room for excur|&s;ive knowledge, or the plea&s;ing fancies of di&s;tant profit.</P>
<P>They have lately found a manufacture con&s;iderably lucrative. Their rocks abound with kelp, a &s;ea-plant, of which the a&s;hes are melted into gra&s;s. They burn
<PB N="298" REF="031692_0621_0FEE76E1A8D581A8">
kelp in great quantities, and then &s;end it away in &s;hips which come regularly to purcha&s;e them. This new &s;ource of riches has rai&s;ed the rents of many maritime farms; but the tenants pay, like all other tenants, the additional rent with great unwillingne&s;s; becau&s;e they con&s;ider the profits of the kelp as the mere pro|duct of per&s;onal labour, to which the landlord contri|butes nothing. However, as any man may be &s;aid to give what he gives the power of gaining he has cer|tainly as much right to profit from the price of kelp, as of any thing el&s;e found or rai&s;ed upon his ground.</P>
<P>This new trade has excited a long and eager litigation between Macdonald and Macleod, for a ledge of rocks which, till the value of kelp was known, neither of them de&s;ired the reputation of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>The cattle of Sky are not &s;o &s;mall as is commonly believed. Since they have &s;ent their beeves in great numbers to &s;outhern marts, they have probably taken more care of their breed. At &s;tated times the annual growth of cattle is driven to a fair, by a general drover, and with the money which he returns to the farmer, the rents are paid.</P>
<P>The price regularly expected, is from two to three pounds a head. There was once one &s;old for five pounds. They go from the I&s;lands very lean, and are not offered to the butcher till they have been long fat|ted in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> pa&s;tures.</P>

Of their black cattle, &s;ome are without horns, called by the Scotch <HI>humble cows,</HI> as we call a bee an <HI>bumble bee,</HI> that wants a &s;ting. Whether this difference be &s;pecific, or accidental, though we enquired with great diligence, we could not be informed.</P>
<P>Their hor&s;es are, like their cows, of a moderate &s;ize. I had no difficulty to mount my&s;elf commodiou&s;ly by the favour of the gentleman.</P>
<P>The goat is the general inhabitant of the earth, complying with every difference of climate and &s;oil. The goats of the Hebrides are like others; nor did I hear any thing of their &s;heep to be particularly re|marked.</P>
<P>In the penury of the&s;e malignant regions, noth|ing is left that can be converted to food. The g&ograve;ats and the &s;heep are milked like the cows.

<P>The milk of goats is much thinner than that of cows, and that of &s;heep is much thicker. Sheep's milk is never eaten before it is boiled. As it is thick, it mu&s;t be very liberal of curd, and the people of St. Kilda form it into &s;mall chee&s;es.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. CV. OF THE INHABITANTS AND HOUSES OF THE HEBRIDES</HEAD>
<P>THE inhabitants of <HI>Sky,</HI> and of the other i&s;lands which I have &s;een, are commonly of the middle &s;tature, with fewer among them very tall or very &s;hort, than are &s;een in England, or perhaps as their numbers are &s;mall, the chances of any deviation from the common mea&s;ure are nece&s;&s;arily few. The talle&s;t men that I &s;aw are among tho&s;e of higher rank. In regions of barren|ne&s;s and &s;carcity, the human race is hindered in its growth by the &s;ame cau&s;es as other animals.</P>
<P>The ladies have as much beauty here as in other pla|ces; but bloom and &s;oftne&s;s are not to be expected among the lower cla&s;&s;es, who&s;e faces are expo&s;&s;ed to the rudene&s;s of the climate, and who&s;e features are &s;ometimes contracted by want, and &s;ometimes harden|ed by the bla&s;ts. Supreme beauty is &s;eldom found in cottages or work-&s;hops, even where no real hard&s;hips are &s;uffered. To expand the human face to its full perfection, it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary that the mind &s;hould co|operate by placidne&s;s of content, or con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;uperiority.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="031692_0625_0FEE76EC0EAD9180">
Their &s;trength is proportionate to their &s;ize, but they are accu&s;tomed to run upon rough ground, and therefore can with great agility &s;kip over the bog, or clamber the mountain. For a campaign in the wa&s;tes of America, &s;oldiers, better qualified could not have been found. Having little work to do, they are not willing, nor perhaps able, to endure a long continu|ance of manual labour, and are therefore con&s;idered as habitually idle.</P>
<P>Having never been &s;upplied with the&s;e accommoda|dations, which life, exten&s;ively diver&s;ified with trades affords, they &s;upply their wants by very in&s;ufficient &s;hifts, and endure many inconveniencies which a lit|tle attention would ea&s;ily relieve. I have &s;een a hor&s;e carrying home the harve&s;t on a crate. Under his tail was a &s;tick for a crupper, held at the two ends by twi&s;ts of &s;traw. Hemp will grow in their i&s;lands, and therefore ropes may be had. If they wanted hemp, they might make better cordage of ru&s;hes, or perhaps of nettles, than of &s;traw.</P>
<P>Their method of life neither &s;ecures them perpet|ual health, nor expo&s;es them to any particular di&s;ea&s;|es. There are phy&s;icians in the i&s;lands, who, I believe, all practi&s;e chirurgery, and all compound their own medicines.</P>
<P>It is generally &s;uppo&s;ed, that life is longer in places where there are few opportunities of luxury; but I
<PB N="303" REF="031692_0626_0FEE76F038335440">
found no in&s;tance here of extraordinary longevity. A cottager grows old over his oaten cakes, like a citizen at a turtle-fea&s;t. He is indeed &s;eldom incommoded by corpulence. Poverty pre&s;ervs him from &s;inking under the burden of him&s;elf, but he e&s;capes no other injury of time. In&s;tances of long life are often related, which tho&s;e who hear them are more willing to cred|it than examine. To be told that any man has attain|ed a hundred years, gives hope and comfort to him who &s;tands trembling on the brink of his own climacte|ric.</P>
<P>Length of life is di&s;tributed impartially to very dif|ferent modes of life in very different climates; and the mountains have no greater examples of age and health, than the lowlands, where I was introduced to two ladies of high quality; one of whom, in her nine|ty-fourth year, pre&s;ided at her table with the full ex|erci&s;e of all her powers; and the other has attained her eighty-fourth, without any diminution of her vivacity, and with little rea&s;on to accu&s;e time of depredations on her beauty.</P>
<P>The habitations of men in the <HI>Hebrides</HI> may be di&s;|tingui&s;hed into huts and hou&s;es. By a hou&s;e, I mean a building with one &s;tory over another, by a hut, a dwelling with only one floor. The Laird, who for|merly lived in a ca&s;tle, now lives in a hou&s;e; &s;ome|times &s;ufficiently neat, but &s;eldom very &s;pacious or
<PB N="304" REF="031692_0627_0FEE76F3164293F0">
&s;plendid. The tack&s;men and the mini&s;ters have com|monly hou&s;es. Wherever there is a hou&s;e, the &s;tran|ger finds a welcome.</P>
<P>Of the hou&s;es little can be &s;aid. They are &s;mall, and by the nece&s;&s;ity of accumulating &s;tores, where there are &s;o few opportunities of purcha&s;e, the rooms are very heterogeneou&s;ly filled. With want of cleanli|ne&s;s it were ingratitude to reproach them; the &s;er|vants having been bred upon the naked earth, think every floor clean; and the quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of gue&s;ts, perhaps not always over-elegant, does not allow much time for adju&s;ting their apartments.</P>
<P>Huts are of many gradations; from murky dens, to commodious dwellings.</P>
<P>The wall of a common hut is always built with mortar, by a &s;kilful adaptation of loo&s;e &s;tones.&mdash;Some|times, perhaps, a double wall of &s;tones is rai&s;ed, and the intermediate &s;pace filled with earth. The air is thus completely excluded. Some walls, are, I think, form|ed of turfs, held together by a wattle, or texture of twigs. Of the meane&s;t huts, the fir&s;t room is lighted by the entrance, and the &s;econd by the &s;moke-hole. The fire is u&s;ually made in the middle. But there are huts or dwellings, of only one &s;tory, inhabited by gentle|men, which have walls cemented with mortar, gla&s;s windows, and boarded floors. Of the&s;e all have chim|neys, and &s;ome chimneys have grates.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e and the furniture are not always nicely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. We were driven once, by mi&s;&s;ing a pa&s;&s;age, to
<PB N="305" REF="031692_0628_0FEE76F89FBFA7B0">
the hut of a gentleman, where after a very liberal &s;upper, when I was conducted to my chamber, I found an ele|gant bed of Indian cotton, &s;pread with fine &s;heets. The accommodation was flattering; I undre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf, and felt my feet in the mire. The bed &s;tood upon the bare earth, which a long cour&s;e of rain had &s;oftened to a puddle.</P>
<P>The petty tenants, and labouring pea&s;ants, live in mi&s;erable cabins, which afford them little more than &s;helter from the &s;torms. The Boor of <HI>Norway</HI> is &s;aid to make all his own uten&s;ils. In the Hebrides, what|ever might be their ingenuity, the want of wood leaves them no materials. They are probably content with &s;uch accommodations as &s;tones of different forms and &s;izes can afford them.</P>
<P>Their food is not better than their lodging. They &s;eldom ta&s;te the fle&s;h of land animals; for here are no markets. What each man cats is from his own flock. The great effect of money is to break property into &s;mall parts. In towns, he that has a &s;hilling may have a piece of meat; but where there is no commerce, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> man can eat mutton but by killing a &s;heep.</P>
<P>Fi&s;h in fair weather they need not want; but, I believe, man never live, long on fi&s;h, but by con|&s;traint; he will rather feed upon roots and ber|ries.</P>
<P>The only fuel of the i&s;lands is peat. Their wood is
<PB N="306" REF="031692_0629_0FEE76FE57146AB0">
all con&s;umed, and coal they have not yet found. Peat is dug out of the mar&s;hes, from the depth of one foot to that of &s;ix. That is accounted the be&s;t which is nearer the &s;urface. It appears to be a ma&s;s of black earth held together by vegetable fibres. I know not whether the earth be bituminous, or whether the fibres be not the only combu&s;tible part; which, by heating the interpo&s;ed earth red-hot, make a burning ma&s;s. The heat is not very &s;trong nor la&s;ting. The a&s;hes are yellowi&s;h, and in a large quantity. When they dig peat, they cut it into &s;quare pieces, and pile it up to dry be&s;ide the hou&s;e. In &s;ome places it has an offen|&s;ive &s;mell. It is like wood charked for the &s;mith. The common method of making peat fires, is by heap|ing it on the earth; but it burns well in grates, and in the be&s;t hou&s;es is &s;o u&s;ed.</P>
<P>The common opinion is, that peat grows again where it has been cut; which, as it &s;eems to be chiefly a ve|getable &s;ub&s;tance, is not unlikely to be true, whether known or not to tho&s;e who relate it.</P>

<P>IT need not, I &s;uppo&s;e, be mentioned, that in coun|tries &s;o little frequented as the I&s;lands, there are no hou|&s;es where travellers are entertained for money. He that wanders about the&s;e wilds, either procures recommen|dations to tho&s;e, who&s;e habitations lie near his way, or, when night and wearine&s;s come upon him, takes the chance of general ho&s;pitality. If he finds only a cot|tage, he can expect little more than &s;helter; for the cot|tagers have little more for them&s;elves. But if his good fortune brings him to the re&s;idence of a gentle|man, he will be glad of a &s;torm to prolong his &s;tay. There is, however, one inn by the &s;ea-&s;ide at Scon&s;or, in Sky, where the po&s;t-office is kept.</P>
<P>At the tables where a &s;tranger is received, neither plenty nor delicacy is wanting. A tract of land &s;o thinly inhabited, mu&s;t have much wild fowl; and I &s;carcely remember to have &s;een a dinner without them. The moor-game is every where to be had. That the &s;ea abounds with fi&s;h, need not be told; for it &s;upplies a great part of Europe. The I&s;le of <HI>Sky,</HI> has &s;tags and roebucks, but no hares. They &s;ell very numerous droves of oxen yearly to England, and therefore cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to want beef at home. Sheep and goats are in great numbers, and they have the common do|me&s;tic fowls.</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="031692_0631_0FEE77042D4D80F0">
But as here is nothing to be bought, every family mu&s;t kill its own meat, and roa&s;t part of it &s;omewhat &s;ooner than Apicius would pre&s;cribe. Every kind of fle&s;h is undoubtedly excelled by the variety and emula|tion of Engli&s;h markets; but that which is not be&s;t may be yet free from bad; and he that &s;hall complain of his fare in the <HI>Hebrides,</HI> has improved his delicacy more than his manhood.</P>
<P>Their fowls are not like tho&s;e plumped for &s;ale by the poulterers of London, but they are as good as other pla|ces commonly afford, except that the gee&s;e, by feeding in the &s;ea, have univer&s;ally a fi&s;hy rankne&s;s.</P>
<P>The&s;e gee&s;e &s;eem to be of a middle race, between the wild and dome&s;tic kinds. They are &s;o tame as to own a home, and &s;o wild as &s;ometimes to fly quite away.</P>
<P>Their native bread is made of oats, or barley. Of oatmeal they &s;pread very thin cakes, coar&s;e and hard, to which unaccu&s;tomed palates are not ea&s;ily reconciled. The barley cakes are thicker and &s;ofter. I began to eat them with unwillingne&s;s. The blackne&s;s of their col|our rai&s;es &s;ome di&s;like, but the ta&s;te is not di&s;agreeable. In mo&s;t hou&s;es there is wheat-flour, with which we were &s;ure to be treated, if we &s;taid long enough to have it kneaded and baked. As neither yea&s;t nor lea|ven are u&s;ed among them, their bread of every kind is unfermented. They make only cakes, and never mould a loaf.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="031692_0632_0FEE7708500184D8">
A man of the Hebrides, for of the women's diet I can give no account, as &s;oon as he appears in the mor|ning, &s;wallows a gla&s;s of whi&s;ky. Yet they are not a drunken race: at lea&s;t I never was pre&s;ent at much in|temperance. But no man is &s;o ab&s;temious as to refu&s;e the morning dram, which they call a <HI>&s;kalk.</HI></P>
<P>The word <HI>whi&s;ky</HI> &s;ignifies water, and is applied by way of eminence to <HI>&s;trong water,</HI> or di&s;tilled liquor. The &s;pirit drunk in the North is drawn from barley. I never ta&s;ted it, except once for experiment at the inn in <HI>Inverary,</HI> when I thought it preferable to any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> malt brandy. It was &s;trong, but not pungent, and was free from the empyreumatic ta&s;te or &s;mell. What was the proce&s;s I had no opportunity of enquiring, nor do I wi&s;h to improve the art of making poi&s;on plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>Not long after the dram may be expected the break|fa&s;t, a meal in which the Scots, whether of the low|lands or mountains, mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed to excel us. The tea and coffee are accompained not only with but|ter, but with honey, con&s;erves, and marmalades. If an epicure could remove by a wi&s;h, in que&s;t of &s;en&s;u|al gratifications, wherever he had &s;upped, he would breakfa&s;t in Scotland.</P>
<P>In the i&s;lands however, they do what I found it not very ea&s;y to endure. They polute the tea-table by plates piled with large &s;lices of Che&s;hire-chee&s;e which mingles its le&s;s grateful odours with the fragrance of the tea.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="031692_0633_0FEE7711D3F81750">
Where many que&s;tions are to be a&s;ked, &s;ome will be omitted. I forgot to enquire how they were &s;upplied with &s;o much exotic luxury. Perhaps the French may bring them wine for wool, and the Dutch give them tea and coffee at the fi&s;hing &s;ea&s;on, in exchange for fre&s;h provi&s;ion. Their trade is un|con&s;trained. They pay no cu&s;toms, for there is no officer to demand them. Whatever therefore is made dear only by impo&s;t, is obtained here at an ea&s;y rate.</P>
<P>A dinner in the We&s;tern I&s;lands, differs very little from a dinner in <HI>England,</HI> except that in the place of tarts, there are always &s;et different preparations of milk. This part of their diet will admit &s;ome improvement. Though they have milk, and eggs, and &s;ugar, few of them know how to compound them in a cu&s;tard. Their gardens afford them no great variety, but they have always &s;ome vegetables on the table. Potatoes at lea&s;t are never wanting, which, though they have not known them long, are now one of the principal parts of their food. They are not of the mealy, but the vi&s;cous kind.</P>
<P>Their more elaborate cookery, or made di&s;hes, an Engli&s;hman at the fir&s;t ta&s;te is not likely to approve; but the culinary compo&s;itions of every country are of|ten &s;uch as become grateful to other nations only by degrees; though I have read a French author, who, in

<P>Their &s;uppers are, like their dinners, various and plentiful. The table is always covered with elegant linen. Their plates for common u&s;e are often of that kind of manufacture which is called cream-coloured, or queen's-ware. They u&s;e &s;ilver on all occa&s;ions where it is common in <HI>England,</HI> nor did I ever find the &s;poon of horn but in one hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The knives are not often either very bright or very &s;harp. They are indeed in&s;truments, of which the Highlanders have not been long acquainted with the general u&s;e. They were not regularly laid on the ta|ble, before the prohibition of arms and the change of dre&s;s. Thirty years ago the Highlander wore his knife as a companion to his dirk or dagger, and when the company &s;at down to meat, the men who had knives, cut the fle&s;h into &s;mall pieces for the women, who with their fingers conveyed it to their mouths.</P>
<P>There was perhaps never any change of national manners &s;o quick, &s;o great, and &s;o general, as that which has operated in the Highlands, by the la&s;t con|que&s;t, and the &s;ub&s;equent laws.
