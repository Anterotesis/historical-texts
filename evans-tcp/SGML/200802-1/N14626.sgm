<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE following letter was written in the year 1776, at the reque&s;t of an American gentleman, who de&s;ired to know my &s;entiments upon the &s;lavery of the Negroes, and profe&s;&s;ed an intention of re&s;toring all his own to liberty, could he be convinced that duty required the &s;acrifice. I therefore &s;ent him the following e&s;&s;ay, the imperfections of which may perhaps be &s;omething extenuated by the precipitati|on with which it was written. It has lain by me many years in ob&s;curity; nor did I choo&s;e to pro|duce it during the progre&s;s of the American conte&s;t. Since the happy termination of that di&s;a&s;trous war, I have &s;hewn it to &s;ome of my particular friends, who have honoured me &s;o far as to de&s;ire copies, and to &s;ugge&s;t that its publication might not be unat|tended with utility. After reflecting upon the &s;ub|ject, I have cho&s;en to comply with their wi&s;hes, and pre&s;ent this fragment to the public; becau&s;e, what|ever di&s;credit it brings upon my head, it may con|tribute to e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;incerity of my heart: And if a &s;ingle human being &s;hould by my means be re|&s;tored to happine&s;s, it is an ample recompence for all the dangers I may incur as an author. Should this e&s;&s;ay ever reach America, it may perhaps di&s;|plea&s;e tho&s;e who have not learned to di&s;cern friends from flatterers, and to di&s;tingui&s;h between the lan|guage of truth and calumny. Tho&s;e, on the con|trary, who are enlightened by a more exten&s;ive know|ledge
<PB N="4" REF="018557_0003_0FA7B1B77A4E29A8">
of human nature, may perhaps re&s;pect an Engli&s;hman, who, after daring to a&s;&s;ert their cau&s;e, through all the varied events of the late revolution, dares now with equal intrepidity a&s;&s;ert the cau&s;e of truth and ju&s;tice, and of that part of the human &s;pecies who&s;e wrongs are yet unredre&s;&s;ed, and almo&s;t unpitied. Should it be a&s;ked why I rather publi&s;h a fragment than a complete e&s;&s;ay, I can only an&s;wer, that I re&s;pect truth &s;o much, that I am not inclined to violate it even as an author; and that this letter having been really written in the year 1776, and being &s;till in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the gentleman to whom it was &s;ent, I do not choo&s;e to piece it with additi|ons in the year 1784.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS extremely &s;urpri&s;ed at receiving a letter, in an unknown hand, which de&s;ired me to give my &s;entiments relative to the &s;lavery of the Negroes; till reading to the end, I recollected the name of a gentleman, whom I had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing with Mr. Laurens. Much as I am flattered by finding my opinion of any con&s;equence with a gentleman of whom I have heard &s;o advantageous a character&punc; I am &s;till more &s;urpri&s;ed, that he can a&s;k it on &s;uch a que&s;tion; a que&s;tion which I am &s;ure his own hu|manity and good &s;en&s;e will be &s;ufficient to decide, if he attends, for a moment, to their dictates. I re&s;|pect you, &s;ir, too much to doubt the &s;incerity of the declaration you make, when you profe&s;s to be guided by rea&s;on and morality upon this que&s;tion; for this is the only arbitration which any man can have to con&s;ult upon a &s;ubject like this: Where they are &s;ilent, the voice of the whole world ought
<PB N="5" REF="018557_0004_0FA7B1B877507A08">
to be di&s;regarded, and where they approve, the di&s;|&s;ent of all mankind can have no influence upon a mind like yours.&mdash;But as you expre&s;sly de&s;ire to know my &s;entiments, I mu&s;t wave both preface and ceremony, and addre&s;s you with the mode&s;t freedom that becomes one man when he is &s;peaking to a|nother upon the mo&s;t important que&s;tion in the uni|ver&s;e. As a member of that &s;ociety which has now made a &s;olemn appeal to Heaven, and taken up arms again&s;t the nation to which it owes its e&s;tabli&s;hment, you mu&s;t admit that there are &s;uch things as right and ju&s;tice, to which the whole human &s;pecies have an indefea&s;ible claim. Indeed, unle&s;s there be &s;uch a thing as ju&s;tice, it is in vain we enquire about its precepts, or refer to its arbitration. He that ad|mits no right but force, no ju&s;tice but &s;uperior vio|lence, arms every man again&s;t him&s;elf, and ju&s;tifies all exce&s;&s;es. If it be lawful to injure becau&s;e we can; if we may &s;eize the property of another, in|&s;ult his per&s;on, or force him to labour for our luxu|ry or caprice, merely becau&s;e he is weaker; this principle will be equally fatal to our&s;elves, when for|tune &s;hall &s;trip us of that power which is our only prerogative, and &s;hift the plea of &s;uperiority. You are to remember that, upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, your &s;laves, the in&s;tant they &s;hall become the &s;tronge&s;t, will have a right to the &s;ervices of your&s;elf and every other gentleman of the &s;outhern colonies; will have a right to force you to labour naked in the sun to the mu&s;ic of whips and chains; to rob you of every thing which is now dear to your indolence, or nece&s;&s;ary to your plea&s;ures; to goad you to every &s;pecies of &s;ervile drudgery, and puni&s;h you for their amu&s;ement and caprice; will have a right to exhau&s;t your youth in &s;ervitude, and to abandon your age to wretchedne&s;s and discases: In one word, fir, they
<PB N="6" REF="018557_0005_0FA7B1895C6E3E0">
will have a right to u&s;e YOU, as you do THEM. Let us, therefore, leave principles which can be main|tained by no one but a profe&s;&s;ed enemy to mankind; who would at one &s;troke extirpate every thing which alleviates the evils of life, and arm every man in an eternal war again&s;t his fellow creatures, to enquire what are the real dictates of that ju&s;tice, who&s;e exi&s;t|ence, I am per&s;uaded, we both allow. You, there|fore, admit there are certain claims, which, for want of a better name, we call rights, to which the hu|man &s;pecies has an indi&s;putable title. To expre&s;s my&s;elf in other words, "There is a method of pur|&s;uing our own happine&s;s in &s;uch a manner, that we may promote the general good at the &s;ame time; or, at lea&s;t not interfere with it." This, our rea&s;on a&s;|&s;ures us, is the privilege of every created being; and while he confines him&s;elf within the&s;e bounds, we feel the mo&s;t cordial approbation of his conduct. We love, and e&s;teem, and &s;ympathize with him, from the very con&s;titution of our nature. On the contrary, whenever any one di&s;turbs or injures a being acting in this manner, or prevents him from attaining the good to which he is impelled, we feel our hatred and indignation mo&s;t forcibly excited again&s;t the aggre&s;&s;or. We con&s;ider &s;uch a character as armed again&s;t the welfare of the world, and as one who is endeavouring to make the common good &s;ub&s;ervient to his own &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s. I appeal to the genero&s;ity of your own nature, for the exi&s;tence of the&s;e principles. Have they not, a thou&s;and times, animated you to acts of virtue and humanity, as well as in&s;pired you with an involuntary reverence for all who acted from their impul&s;e? Have they not often pleaded the cau&s;e of the wretch that lay trembling and defencele&s;s at your feet, and, in &s;pite of the pre|judices of your country and education, whi&s;pered to
<PB N="7" REF="018557_0006_0FA7B1B93B40E260">
your mind that one human being ought not to hold his exi&s;tence by the tenure of another's will?</P>
<P>Do not the&s;e principles now in&s;pire you, and fre|quently impel you beyond the bounds of prudence and &s;afety, while what you call your country's cau&s;e animates you to exertion? But this cau&s;e is only the united cau&s;e and intere&s;t of every particular man; tho&s;e rights which the Great Creator taught him to di&s;cover when he gave him rea&s;on, which he urges him to defend by pa&s;&s;ion, and which a mind like yours prizes beyond the gratifications of &s;en&s;e, and dares to gra&s;p at even while it is peri&s;h|ing. This appears to me to be a plain and conci&s;e deduction of morality, which means no|thing more than that method or rule of conduct by which the whole human &s;pecies may attain the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible degree of happine&s;s. And I rather choo&s;e to expre&s;s my&s;elf &s;o, becau&s;e I thus compre|hend all &s;ects and opinions. The religious man al|lows that the happine&s;s of the &s;pecies is the great end of the Deity, which he promotes by the rewards and puni&s;hments of a future &s;tate: The di&s;ciple of Shaft&s;bury under&s;tands this, when he talks of the beauty of virtue and the love of order; and even the gloomy pupil of Hobbes, who re&s;olves every thing into &s;elf intere&s;t, mu&s;t allow the exi&s;tence of moral di&s;tinctions, &s;o far as they influence the wel|fare of the &s;pecies. This univer&s;al morality appears to me to be the only rational and legal foundation of all human government; which ought to be no|thing more than the application of this general rule to particular &s;ocieties, and the enforcing it by civil e&s;tabli&s;hments. If, therefore, it be granted, that the rights of a nation are nothing more than the rights of every man in it, and that all ju&s;t and legal autho|rity &s;uppo&s;es a delegated power entru&s;ted &s;olely for
<PB N="8" REF="018557_0007_0FA7B1BA063A44D0">
the purpo&s;e of promoting the general good; it will appear evident that every individual in the univer&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es certain rights, which no man can dive&s;t him of without inju&s;tice, unle&s;s he be guilty of &s;ome crime again&s;t &s;ociety which expo&s;es him to its ven|geance. Hence it follows, that whenever any na|tion attacks the rights and happine&s;s of another na|tion, it de&s;erves to find its own de&s;truction in the attempt; and whenever any individual pre&s;umes to exerci&s;e this &s;pecies of authority over his fellow crea|tures, he mu&s;t be a tyrant and an oppre&s;&s;or, whom it is permitted to de&s;troy by every po&s;&s;ible method. Whoever would deny this, mu&s;t either deny the ex|i&s;tence of right and ju&s;tice entirely, and then it is in vain to argue; or mu&s;t &s;hew &s;ome natural di&s;tinction by which one part of the &s;pecies is entitled to pri|vileges from which the other is excluded. The fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ition I have already con&s;idered, and the &s;econd is altogether ab&s;urd; for all alterations and di&s;tinc|tions among mankind &s;olely ari&s;e from civil govern|ment, which has no other ju&s;t foundation than na|tural right; and natural right, for that rea&s;on, mu&s;t be a principle of higher authority than civil govern|ment. Whenever, therefore, civil government tends to de&s;troy and confound the rights of nature, it cea&s;es to have any claim to our obedience; it be|comes tyranny, corruption, de&s;poti&s;m, a pe&s;t in&s;tead of a ble&s;&s;ing, and &s;ubver&s;ive of every purpo&s;e for which it was in&s;tituted, or ought to be continued.</P>
<P>I am extremely fearful of expre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf ob|&s;curely upon &s;o ab&s;tract a &s;ubject, and mu&s;t, there|fore, though with the hazard of prolixity, attempt to place it in a different light.&mdash;If you imagine any number of the human &s;pecies a&s;&s;embled in &s;ome par|ticular part of the globe, without any form of go|vernment e&s;tabli&s;hed among them; it is evident,
<PB N="9" REF="018557_0008_0FA7B1BD799B3140">
that the&s;e individuals may either live together in &s;uch a manner as to produce mutual comfort and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, or may be the cau&s;e of continual mi&s;ery to each other. No propo&s;ition in the mathematics can be inve&s;tigated with more preci&s;ion than the methods of conduct which have the&s;e contrary ten|dencies. Every di&s;po&s;ition which inclines one man to a&s;&s;i&s;t another, or to avoid giving him offence and doing him injury, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily contribute to the common welfare; which would be perfect, were the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions cultivated in the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible degree. On the contrary, every di&s;po&s;ition, which, either by fraud or violence, tends to interrupt the per&s;onal &s;ecurity of individuals, or to deprive them of tho&s;e things which they have acquired by their indu&s;try, is detrimental to the &s;um of happine&s;s, and would, if carried to the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible degree, entirely de&s;troy that part of the &s;pecies.&mdash;In this view of things, morality ari&s;es from nece&s;&s;ity, and comprehends "certain rules of conduct founded upon the relations which beings endowed with par|ticular faculties bear to each other; which rules, when properly ob&s;erved, produce happine&s;s to &s;o|ciety; but when violated or neglected, as nece&s;&s;a|rily occa&s;ion mi&s;ery, as fire or pointed &s;ub&s;tances excite pain, when they act too forcibly upon the nerves."</P>
<P>I hardly think that the greate&s;t &s;ceptic will deny the&s;e di&s;tinctions founded upon facts as certain as the impre&s;&s;ion of any material &s;ub&s;tance upon our &s;en&s;es. If we, now, proceed a little farther, we &s;hall find that the di&s;po&s;itions which produce the&s;e different kinds of conduct are by the morali&s;ts ex|pre&s;&s;ed by different names, and enforced by different motives, according to their &s;everal &s;y&s;tems; while natural religion adds its &s;anctions, and inclines us
<PB N="10" REF="018557_0009_0FA7B1BDB3D66A90">
to believe that the Deity him&s;elf, who has di&s;played &s;o great an attention to the happine&s;s and pre&s;erva|tion of his creatures here, may extend his benevo|lence to another &s;tage of exi&s;tence, and compen&s;ate the evils &s;ometimes unmeritedly &s;uffered below. But if we admit the evidence of revealed religion, the &s;cheme of human things is perfect as it is au|gu&s;t; the clouds which over&s;hadowed our horizon are di&s;&s;ipated, and the gradual progre&s;s of trium|phant virtue, through dangers and difficulties, to eternal happine&s;s, is di&s;played and a&s;certained.</P>
<P>Having laid down the&s;e principles, it is ea&s;y to apply them to the particular ca&s;e in que&s;tion. Sla|very is the ab&s;olute dependance of one man upon another; and is, therefore, as incon&s;i&s;tent with all ideas of ju&s;tice, as de&s;poti&s;m is with the rights of na|ture. It is a crime &s;o mon&s;trous again&s;t the hu|man &s;pecies, that all tho&s;e who practi&s;e it de&s;erve to be extirpated from the earth. It is no little indirect attack upon the &s;afety and happine&s;s of our fellow creatures, but one that boldly &s;trikes at the founda|tions of all humanity and ju&s;tice. Robbers invade the property, and murderers the life of human be|ings; but he that holds another man in bondage, &s;ubjects the whole &s;um of his exi&s;tence to oppre&s;&s;ion, bereaves him of every hope, and is, therefore, more dete&s;table than robber and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in combined. But if no one who has common feeling will commit the outrage, no one who has common &s;en&s;e will attempt to ju&s;tify it by argument; &s;ince it would involve him in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t inextricable contradic|tions. He mu&s;t allow that every man has, by na|ture, a right to life, yet that every other man has a right to rob him of it; that every man has an equal right to &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, yet that every other may deprive him of all the means; and that while every indivi|dual
<PB N="11" REF="018557_0010_0FA7B1BEAF77B7D8">
is ju&s;tified by nature and the Deity in pur&s;uing his own happine&s;s by all innocent methods, every other individual is equally ju&s;tified in making him mi&s;erable. In &s;hort, it is reducing every thing to the &s;tate before de&s;cribed, a &s;tate of conte&s;t and de|&s;olation from which right and ju&s;tice are equally ex|cluded.</P>
<P>Of you, &s;ir, who &s;ay you have &s;everal &s;laves, I beg leave to a&s;k what are the rights you claim over them? Have you a right to torture them when they are guilty of no faults? Have you a right to kill them for your diver&s;ion? Is your power circum|&s;cribed by no bounds, and are there particular be|ings who bring into the world all the rights which you your&s;elf can pretend to, but have &s;o entirely lo&s;t them by being tran&s;ported into another country, as to be beyond the protection both of nature and of nature's God?</P>
<P>Surely, &s;ir, unle&s;s I am deceived in you, you are a man both of honour and humanity. You &s;tart at the idea of wanton and unprovoked barbarity. You would not murther a &s;lave to &s;hew your dexterity, nor maim him to prove your &s;trength; you would not da&s;h an infant upon the ground to feed your dogs, even tho' he was black; nor would you rip up the belly of his mother while &s;he was &s;uckling him, to improve your &s;kill in anatomy. You nei|ther would, nor dare you commit actions like the&s;e; you feel that you have no right to do them; or, if you have, that every other man has an equal and &s;uperiour right to de&s;troy you like a bea&s;t of prey. What then are your rights? I anticipate your an|&s;wer: You will feed and cloath your negroes, you will treat them with humanity and tenderne&s;s, and then you have a right to moderate advantage from their labors. All this, &s;ir, is well; and could I con|ceive
<PB N="12" REF="018557_0011_0FA7B1C361D97760">
that you ever had acted in another manner, I &s;hould never have troubled you with this tedious letter. While your negroes choo&s;e to &s;tay with you upon the&s;e terms, this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s a fair and equitable compact. But what if they &s;hould choo&s;e to leave you, will you let them go? If you do, you are a man of honor, &s;en&s;e, and humanity; but I fear no We&s;t Indian.</P>
<P>Are there no whips, no gibbets, no puni&s;hments more dreadful than death it&s;elf for contumacious &s;laves? And what is this but claiming the dete&s;ta|ble power I have mentioned above, that of making other beings mi&s;erable, for your intere&s;t or amu&s;e|ment? Who, &s;ir, gave you a title to their labours, or a right to confine them to loath&s;ome drudgery? And if you have no right to this, what are the pu|ni&s;hments you pretend to inflict but &s;o many addi|tional outrages? Has a robber a claim upon your life becau&s;e you withhold your property; or a ra|vi&s;her a right to a woman's blood becau&s;e &s;he de|fends her cha&s;tity? Either then prove your right to their labours, or acknowledge that the puni&s;hments inflicted upon fugitive &s;laves are a flagitious in&s;ult upon ju&s;tice, humanity and common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Permit me, here, to examine for a moment the nature of the title by which you claim an irredeem|able property in the labours of your fellow crea|tures.&mdash;A wretch, devoid of compa&s;&s;ion and under|&s;tanding, who calls him&s;elf a king of &s;ome part of Africa, which &s;uffers the calamity of being fre|quented by the Europeans, &s;eizes his innocent &s;ub|jects, or engages in an unnece&s;&s;ary war to furni&s;h him&s;elf with pri&s;oners; the&s;e are loaded with chains, torn from all their comforts and connections, and driven (like bea&s;ts to the &s;laughter hou&s;e) down to the &s;ea &s;hore, where the mild &s;ubjects of a Chri&s;tian

I &s;hudder at the horrors which I de|&s;cribe, and blu&s;h to be a human creature! Yet the&s;e are not the colours of de&s;cription, but a recital of facts le&s;s &s;trong than the reality. Can any man re|flect upon the&s;e things, without unutterable remor&s;e, Can he know that, perhaps, while he is wallowing in luxury and &s;en&s;uality, there are beings who&s;e ex|i&s;tence he has embittered, mothers &s;hrieking for their children, and children peri&s;hing for want of their mothers care; wretches who are frantic with rage, &s;hame and de&s;peration, or pining in all the agonies of &s;low and painful death, who might have

<P>After the arrival of the &s;urviving wretches in Ame|rica, you well know in what manner they are tran&s;|ferred to their con&s;cientious ma&s;ters&mdash;how they are brought to the market, naked, weeping, and in chains&mdash;how one man dares to examine his fellow creatures as he would do bea&s;ts, and bargain for their per&s;ons&mdash;how all the mo&s;t &s;acred duties, affections, and feelings of the human heart, are violated and in&s;ulted; and thus you dare to call your&s;elves the ma&s;ters of wretches whom you have acquired by fraud, and retain by violence!&mdash;While I am tracing this practi&s;e, which you and every man who has been in the i&s;lands or the &s;outhern colonies of Ame|rica, knows to be true, my a&s;toni&s;hment exceeds even my horror, to find it po&s;&s;ible that any one &s;hould &s;eriou&s;ly doubt whether an equitable title to hold human beings in bondage can be thus acquired.</P>
<P>With what face, &s;ir, can he who has never re|&s;pected the rights of nature in another, pretend to claim them in his own favour? How dare the in|habitants of the &s;outhern colonies &s;peak of privileges and ju&s;tice? Is money of &s;o much more importance than life? Or have the Americans &s;hared the di&s;pen|&s;ing power of St. Peter's &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, to excu&s;e their own ob&s;ervance of tho&s;e rules which they impo&s;e on others? If there be an object truly ridiculous in nature, it is an American patriot, &s;igning re&s;olutions of independency with the one hand, and with the other brandi&s;hing a whip over his affrighted &s;laves.</P>
<P>If men would be con&s;i&s;tent, they mu&s;t admit all the con&s;equences of their own principles; and you and your countrymen are reduced to the dilemma of either acknowledging the rights of your negroes,

Can any thing be clearer, than that a man who is born free can never forfeit his inheritance by &s;uffering oppre&s;&s;ion; and that it is a contradiction to urge a purcha&s;e of what no one has a right to &s;ell? Nor does it make any difference, whether the un|fortunate victim pa&s;s from one to another, or from one to a thou&s;and ma&s;ters, any more than whether a nation be en&s;laved by a fir&s;t or by an hundredth ty|rant. There can be no pre&s;cription pleaded again&s;t truth and ju&s;tice; and the continuance of the evil is &s;o far from ju&s;tifying, that it is an exaggeration of the crime.

I was not a little plea&s;ed with this my fir&s;t reception; it convinced me, that there ought to be a con&s;iderable abatement made in the accounts I had read and heard every where of the &s;avage character of the Africans. I ob&s;erved, both in negroes and Moors, great hu|manity and &s;ociablene&s;s, which gave me &s;trong hopes, that I &s;hould be very &s;afe among&s;t them, and meet with the &s;ucce&s;s I de&s;ired, in my en|quiries after the curio&s;ities of the country.</Q></P>

He adds, That &s;ome negroes, who have had an a greeable education, have manife&s;ted a brightne&s;s of under&s;tanding equal to any of us.</Q> Speaking of the fruitfulne&s;s of the country, he &s;ays, <Q>It was very populace, plentifully provided with corn, potatoes and fruit, which grew clo&s;e to each other; in &s;ome places a foot-path is the only ground that is not covered with them; the ne|groes leaving no place, which is thought fertile, uncultivated; and immediately after they have reaped, they are &s;ure to &s;ow again.</Q> Other parts he de&s;cribes, as, <Q>being full of towns and villages; the &s;oil very rich, and &s;o well cultivated as to look like an entire garden, abounding in rice, corn, oxen and poultry, and the inhabitants labo|rious.</Q></P>
<P>William Smith, who was &s;ent by the African Company to vi&s;it their &s;ettlements on the coa&s;t of Guinea, in the year 1726, gives much the &s;ame ac|count of the country of Delmina and Cape Cor&s;e, &amp;c. for beauty and goodne&s;s, and adds, <Q>The more you come downward towards that part, called Slave-Coa&s;t, the more delightful and rich the &s;oil ap|pears.

It is ea&s;y to perceive what happy memories they are ble&s;&s;ed with, and how great progre&s;s they would make in the &s;cience, in ca&s;e their genius was cultivated with &s;tudy.</Q> He adds, from the information he received of one of the Factors, who had re&s;ided ten years in that coun|try, <Q>That the di&s;cerning natives account it their

<P>Andrew Brue, a principal man in the French Fac|tory, in the account he gives of the great river Se|negal, which runs many hundred miles up the coun|try, tells his readers, <Q>The farther you go from the &s;ea, the country on the river &s;eems more fruitful and well improved. It abounds in Guinea and Indian corn, rice, pul&s;e, tobacco, and indigo. Here are va&s;t meadows, which feed large herds of great and &s;mall cattle; poultry are numerous, as well as wild fowl.</Q> The &s;ame author, in his travels to the &s;outh of the river Gambia, expre&s;&s;es his &s;urprize, <Q>To &s;ee the land &s;o well cultivated; &s;carce a &s;pot lay unimproved; the low grounds divided by &s;mall canals, were all &s;owed with rice; the higher ground planted with Indian corn, mil|let, and pea&s;e of different &s;orts, beef and mutton very cheap, as well as all other nece&s;&s;aries of life.</Q> The account that this author gives of the di&s;po&s;ition of the natives, is, <Q>That they are generally good-natured and civil, and may be brought to any thing by fair and &s;oft means. Artus, &s;peaking of the &s;ame people, &s;ays, They are a &s;incere, inof|fen&s;ive people, and do no inju&s;tice either to one another or &s;trangers.</Q></P>
<P>Francis Moor, Factor to the African company on the river Gambia, relates, <Q>That when the king of Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;alli wants goods, &amp;c. he &s;ends a me&s;|&s;enger to the Engli&s;h governor at James' fort, to de&s;ire he would &s;end up a &s;loop with a cargo of goods, which (&s;ays the author) the governor never fails to do; again&s;t the time the ve&s;&s;el ar|rives, the king plunders &s;ome of his enemies

<P>N. Brue, in his account of the trade, &amp;c. writes, <Q>That having received a quantity of goods, he wrote to the king of the country, that if he had a &s;ufficient number of &s;laves, he was ready to trade with him. This Prince, (&s;ays that author) as well as other negro monarchs, has al|ways a &s;ure way of &s;upplying his deficiencies by &s;elling his own &s;ubjects.&mdash;The king had re|cour&s;e to this method, by &s;eizing three hundred of his own people, and &s;ent word to Brue, that he had the &s;laves ready to deliver for the goods.</Q></P>

It is you that induce the African villain to &s;ell his countrymen; and in order thereto, to &s;teal, rob, murder men, women and chil|dren without number: by enabling the Engli&s;h vil|lain to pay him for &s;o doing; whom you over pay for his execrable labour. It is your money, that is the &s;pring of all, that impowers him to go on; &s;o that whatever he or the African does in this matter, is all your act and deed. And is your con&s;cience quite reconciled to this? Does it never reproach you at all? Has gold entirely blinded your eyes and &s;tupi|fied your heart? Can you &s;ee, can you feel no harm therein? Is it doing as you would be done to? Make the ca&s;e your own. <Q>Ma&s;ter (&s;aid a &s;lave at Liver|pool to the merchant that owned him) what if &s;ome of my countrymen were to come here, and take away my mi&s;tre&s;s, and ma&s;ter Tommy and ma&s;ter Billy, and carry them into our country and make them &s;laves, how would you like it?</Q> His an&s;wer was worthy of a man: <Q>I will never buy a &s;lave more while I live.</Q> O let his re&s;o|lution be yours! Have no more any part in this de|te&s;table bu&s;ine&s;s. In&s;tantly leave it to tho&s;e unfeel|ing wretches, <Q>who laugh at humanity and com|pa&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>

And this equally concerns every per&s;on who has an e&s;tate in our American plantations: Yea, all &s;lave-holders of whatever rank and degree; &s;eeing men-buyers are exactly on a level with men-&s;tealers. Indeed, you &s;ay, <Q>I pay hone&s;tly for my goods; and I am not concerned to know how they are come by.</Q> Nay but you are: You are deeply concerned, to know that they are not &s;tolen: Other|wi&s;e you are partaker with a thief, and are not a jot hone&s;ter than him. But you know they are not hone&s;tly come by: You know they are procured by means nothing near &s;o innocent as picking of pock|ets, hou&s;e-breaking, or robbery upon the highway. You know they are procured by a deliberate &s;eries of more complicated villainy (of fraud, robbery and murder) than was ever practi&s;ed either by Maho|metans or Pagans; in particular by murders of all kinds; by the blood of the innocent poured upon the ground like water. Now it is your money that pays the merchant, and through him the captain and African butchers. You therefore are guilty: Yea principally guilty, of all the&s;e frauds, robbe|ries, and murders. You are the &s;pring that puts all the re&s;t in motion; they would not &s;tir a &s;tep with|out you&mdash;Therefore the blood of all the&s;e wretches, who die before their time, whether in their country or el&s;ewhere, lies upon your head. The blood of thy brother (for whether thou wilt believe it or no, &s;uch he is in the &s;ight of him that made him) crieth again&s;t thee from the earth, from the &s;hip and from the waters. O! whatever it co&s;t, put a &s;top to its cry, before it be too late. In&s;tantly, at any price, were it the half of thy goods, deliver thy|&s;elf from blood guiltine&s;s! Thy hands, thy bed, thy furniture, thy hou&s;e, thy land, are at pre&s;ent &s;tained with blood. Surely it is enough; accumu|late
<PB N="28" REF="018557_0027_0FA7B1E03A585B08">
no more guilt: Spill no more the blood of the innocent! Do not hire another to &s;hed blood! Do not pay him for doing it! Whether thou art a Chri&s;|tian or no, &s;hew thy&s;elf a man; be not more &s;a|vage than a lion or a bear.</P>
<P>Perhaps thou wilt &s;ay, <Q>I do not buy any ne|groes: I only u&s;e tho&s;e left me by my father.</Q> But is it enough to &s;atisfy your own con&s;cience! Had your father, have you, has any living, a right to u&s;e another as a &s;lave! It cannot be, even &s;etting REVELATION a&s;ide. It cannot be, that either war or contract, can give any man &s;uch a property in a|nother as he has in his &s;heep and oxen: Much le&s;s is it po&s;&s;ible, that any child of man, &s;hould ever be born a &s;lave. Liberty is the right of every human creature, as &s;oon as he breathes the vital air. And no human law can deprive him of that right, which he derives from the law of nature. If therefore you have any regard to ju&s;tice, (to &s;ay nothing of mercy, nor of the revealed law of God) render unto all their due. Give liberty to whom liberty is due, that is to every child of man, to every partaker of human nature. Let none &s;erve you but by his own act and deed, by his own voluntary choice; away with whips, chains, and all compul&s;ion. Be gentle to|wards all men. And &s;ee that you invariably do un|to every one, as you would he &s;hould do unto you.</P>
