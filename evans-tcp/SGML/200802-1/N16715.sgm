<HEAD>THE LIFE AND LITERARY CHARACTER OF JAMES THOMSON; Pointing out &s;ome particular Beauties of the Au|thor for the U&s;e of young Minds.</HEAD>
<P>JAMES THOMSON, an eminent Briti&s;h poet, was the &s;on of a Divine in Scotland, and born at Ednam, in the &s;hire of Roxburgh, the eleventh of Sep|tember, 1700. He gave early marks of genius, which was di&s;coverable through the rudene&s;s of his puerile e&s;&s;ays; and, after the u&s;ual cour&s;e of &s;chool educa|tion at J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dburgh, was &s;ent to the univer&s;ity of Edin|burgh. In the &s;econd year of his admi&s;&s;ion, his &s;tu|dies were for &s;ome time interrupted by the death of his father; but his mother &s;oon after repaired with her family, which was very numerous, to Edinburgh, where &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> lived in a decent frugal manner, till her favourite &s;on had not only fini&s;hed his academical
<PB N="ii" REF="021495_0005_0FB40425910CDA58">
cour&s;e, but was even d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tingui&s;hed and patronized as a genius. About this time the &s;tudy of poetry be|came pretty general in Scotland, the be&s;t Engli&s;h au|thors being univer&s;ally read, and imitations of them attempted; but ta&s;te as yet had made but little pro|gre&s;s, cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tici&s;m being there limited to rules and forms, which &s;erved only to di&s;cover the inaccuracies of a poet, while his fire and fancy e&s;caped their notice. Thom&s;on, who believed he was entitled to judges of a more exalted genius, began to turn his views to|wards London which an accident &s;oon after intirely determined him in.</P>
<P>The divinity chair at Edinburgh was then filled by Mr Hamilton, who&s;e lectures our author attended ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut a year, when in an exerci&s;e in the p&s;alm, in which the power and maje&s;ty of God were celebrat|ed, he gave &s;o highly poetical and &s;ublime a para|phra&s;e and illu&s;tration, that it &s;urprized the whole audience. Mr. Hamilton complimented him on this performance in a particular manner; but at the &s;ame time told him, in his &s;miles of approbation, that if he expected to be u&s;eful in the mini&s;try, he mu&s;t keep a &s;tricter rein upon his imagination, and expre&s;s him|&s;elf in language more &s;uitable to an audience, where the learned and unlearned are equally re&s;pectable. Thom&s;on concluded from this, that his expectations from the &s;tudy of theology might be precarious, even though the church had been his choice; &s;o that, hav|ing &s;ome encouragement from a lady of quality, a friend of his mother, then in London, he quickly pre|pared for his journey, which ended in no more than giving him an opportunity of entering on the &s;tage of the unknown world, without a patron, and but &s;paringly provided with ca&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="021495_0006_0FB4042710501238">However, his merit did not lie long concealed. Mr. Forbes, af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rds lord pre&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, received him very kindly, and introduced him to &s;ome of his friends, part<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cularly to Mr. Aickman, who&s;e premature death he has with great affection comme|morated, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n a copy of ver&s;es written on that occa&s;ion. The favourable manner in which he was every where received, emboldened him to ri&s;k the publicat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on of his <HI>Winter,</HI> in March <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">726, which wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> no &s;ooner read than univ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r&s;ally admired; and from that time his ac|quaintance was courted by all men of ta&s;te Dr. Rundle, afterwards bi&s;hop of Lerry, received him into his intimate confidence and friend&s;hip; promoted his character every where: introduced him to his great friend the lord chancellor Talbot; and &s;ome years after, when the elde&s;t &s;on of that nobleman was to make his tour, recommended Mr Thom&s;on as a proper companion for him. His affection and gra|titude to Dr. Rundle are finely expre&s;&s;ed, in his poem to the memory of lord Talbot. Our author held the e&s;timation of the public &s;o highly, that he fi|ni&s;hed the plan which their wi&s;hes laid out for him; and the expectations which his <HI>Winter</HI> had rai&s;ed, were fully an&s;wered in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive publication of the other &s;ea&s;ons; <HI>Summer,</HI> in the year <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">727; <HI>Spring,</HI> in the beginn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng of 1728; and <HI>Autumn,</HI> in a quarto edition of his works, in 1730.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, and his tragedy of Sophoni&s;b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, which was well received in the year 1729, Mr. Thom&s;on had, in 1727, publi&s;hed his poem to the memory of Sir I&s;aac Newton, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n lately decea&s;ed. The &s;ame year, the re&s;entment of our merchants, for the interruption of their trade by the Spaniards in America&punc; running very high, Mr Thom&s;on zea|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ou&s;ly took part in it, and wrote his poem Britannia,
<PB N="iv" REF="021495_0007_0FB4042890346C18">
to rou&s;e the nation to revenge. His poetical pur&s;uits were now interrupted by his attendance on the ho|nourable Mr. Charles Talbot in his travels, with whom he vi&s;ited mo&s;t of the courts and capital cities of Europe. How particular and judicious his ob&s;er|vations were, appears from his poem on Liberty, in five parts, thus in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itled. Ancient and Modern Italy compared; Gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce; Rome; Britain; the Pro&s;pect. While he was writing the fir&s;t part of Liberty, he received a &s;evere &s;hock, by the death of his noble friend and fellow-traveller, and this was &s;oon fol|lowed by another &s;till more &s;o, and of more general concern, the death of lord Talbot him&s;elf; which Mr. Thom&s;on &s;o pathetically laments, in the poem dedicated to his memory. At the &s;ame time he found him&s;elf from an ea&s;y competency, reduced to a &s;tate of precarious dependence, in which he pa&s;&s;ed the remainder of his life, excepting only the two la&s;t years of it, during which he enjoyed the place of &s;urveyor general of the Leeward i&s;lands, procured for him by the generous friend&s;hip of lord Lyttleton.</P>
<P>Immediately upon his return to England with Mr. Talbot, the chancellor had made him his &s;ecretary of briefs, a place of li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tle attendance, &s;uiting his re|tired indolent way of life, and equal to all his wants. This place <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ell with his patron; yet his genius could not be depre&s;&s;ed, or his temper hurt, by this rever&s;e of fortune. He re&s;umed, in time, his u&s;ual chear|fulne&s;s, and never abated one article in his way of living; which, though &s;imple, was elegant, and with a peculiar neatne&s;s. The profits ari&s;ing from his works w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re not incon&s;iderable; his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dy of Agamemnon, acted in 1738, gave many nigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s to the author.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="021495_0008_0FB4042A0F412AA8">But his chief dependence, during this long inter|val, was on the protection and bounty of his royal highne&s;s Frederick Prince of Wales, who, upon the recommendation of lord Lyttleton, then his chief fa|vourite, &s;ettled on him an hand&s;ome allowance, and always received him very graciou&s;ly. It hap|pened, however, that the favour of his royal high|ne&s;s was, in one in&s;tance, of &s;ome prejudice to Mr. Thom&s;on, in the refu&s;al of a licence for his tragedy of Edward and Eleanora, which he had prepared for the &s;tage in the year 1739. This proceeded from the mi&s;under&s;tand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng which then &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the court of the prince of Wales, and that of the king his father. His next dramatic performance was the ma&s;que of Alfred, written jointly with Mr. Mallet, who was his good friend on many occa&s;ions, and by command of the prince of Wales, for the entertainment of his royal highne&s;s's court at his Summer re&s;idence&punc; In the year 1745, his Tancred and Sigi&s;munda, taken from the novel in Gil Blas, was well received. He in the mean time, was fi|ni&s;hing his Ca&s;tle of Indolence, an allegorical poem, in two canto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. The &s;tanza in which he wrote this piece is that of Spencer, borrowed from the Italian poets. This was the la&s;t piece publi&s;hed by Mr. Thom&s;on, his tragedy of C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lanus being only. prepared for the theatre, when a fever &s;eized him, and deprived the world of a very good man, as well as a very great poet. His death happened on the 27th of Augu&s;t, 1748. His executors were the lord Lyt|tleton and Mr. Mitchel; and, by their intere&s;t, the orphan play of Coriolanus was brought on the &s;tage to the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t advantage: from the pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fits of which, and from the &s;ale of his manu&s;cripts and other effects, all demands were duly &s;atisfied, and a hand&s;ome &s;um
<PB N="vi" REF="021495_0009_0FB4042C3B824890">
remitted to his &s;i&s;ters. His remains were depo&s;ited in the church of Richmond, under a plain &s;tone, without any in&s;cription.</P>
<P>Mr. Thom&s;on him&s;elf hints, &s;omewhere in his works, that his figure was not the mo&s;t promi&s;ing, his make being rather robu&s;t than graceful; and his wor&s;t appearance was, when he was &s;een walking alone, in a thoughtful mood: but when &s;aluted by a friend&punc; and they entered into conver&s;ation he would in&s;tantly brighten into a mo&s;t amiable a&s;pect, his features no longer the &s;ame, and his eyes darting a peculiar and animated fire. He had im|proved his ta&s;te by the be&s;t originals, both ancient and modern, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t could not bear to write what was not &s;trictly hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> own. What he borrowed from the ancients, he gives us in an avowed faithful paraphra&s;e, or tran&s;lation, as we &s;ee in a few pa&s;&s;ages taken from Virgil, and in that beautiful picture from the elder Pliny, where the cour&s;e and gradual increa&s;e of the Nile are figured by the &s;tages of man's life The Autumn was his favourite &s;ea&s;on for poetical compo|&s;ition, and the deep &s;ilence of the night the t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me he commonly cho&s;e for &s;uch &s;tudies: &s;o that he would often be heard walking in his &s;tudy till near morning, humming over, in his way, what he was to correct and write out the next day. The amu&s;ements of his lei&s;ure hours were civil and natural hi&s;tory, voyages, and the be&s;t relations of travellers; and, had his &s;i|tuation favoured it, he would certainly have excelled in gardening, agriculture, and every rural improve|ment and exerci&s;e. Although he performed on no in&s;trument, he was pa&s;&s;ionately fond of mu&s;ic, and would &s;ometimes li&s;ten a full hour at his window to the nightingales in Richmond-gardens. Nor was
<PB N="vii" REF="021495_0010_0FB4042D1008ACE0">
his ta&s;te le&s;s exqui&s;ite in the arts of painting, &s;culp|ture, and architecture. In his travels, he had &s;een all the mo&s;t celebrated monuments of antiquity, and the be&s;t productions of modern art, and had &s;tudied them &s;o minutely, and with &s;uch true judgment, that, in &s;ome of his de&s;criptions of his poem on Liberty, we have them &s;o delineated as to place them in a &s;tronger light, perhaps, than if we &s;aw them with our eyes. As for the more di&s;tingui&s;hing qualities of his mind and heart, they are be&s;t di&s;coverable in his writings, than they can be pre&s;ented by the pen of any biographer. There his love of mankind, of his country and friends; his devotion to his God, founded on the mo&s;t elevated and ju&s;t conception of his operative power and providence, &s;hines in every page. So unbounded was his tenderne&s;s of heart, that it took in even the brute creation: he was ex|tremely tender towards his own &s;pecies. He is not indeed known, through his whole life, to have given any per&s;on one moment's pain by his writings, or otherwi&s;e. He took no part in the poetical &s;quabbles of his time, and &s;o was re&s;pected and left undi&s;turb|ed by both parties. The&s;e amiable virtues, this di|vine temper of mind, did not fail of their due re|ward: the be&s;t and greate&s;t men of his time honour|ed him with their friend&s;hip and protection: the ap|plau&s;e of the public attended all his productions; his friends loved him with an enthu&s;ia&s;tic ardour, and &s;incerely lamented his untimely death.</P>

A tale relative to it. A harve&s;t-&s;torm. Shooting and hunting, their barbarity. A ludicrous account of fox-hunting. A view of an orchard. Wall-fruit. A vineyard. A de&s;cription of fogs, frequent in the latter part of <HI>Autumn:</HI> whence a digre&s;&s;ion, enquiring into the ri&s;e of fountains and rivers. Birds of &s;ea&s;on con|&s;idered, that now &s;hift their habitation. The prodigi|ous number of them that cover the northern and we&s;tern i&s;les of <HI>SCOTLAND.</HI> Hence a view of the country. A pro&s;pect of the di&s;coloured, fading woods. After a gen|tle du&s;ky day, moon-light. Autumnal meteors.
