<HEAD>THE CURIOSITIES OF Common Water.</HEAD>
<P>_FOR the Benefit of Mankind in general, I have taken Pairs to give the World an Ac|count of what I have found written <HI>in the Works of the mo&s;t Eminent Phy&s;icians,</HI> concerning the Good that Mankind may re|ceive from the u&s;e of COMMON WATER; and of the Informations I have had concerning the <HI>Benefits thereof</HI> from others by Word of Mouth; and of what I have di&s;covered <HI>by my own Experience,</HI> from frequent Trials during a Time that hath intervened from that of <HI>Thirty</HI> to <HI>Seventy four Years of Age</HI>: Which is &s;ufficient to confirm the &s;tupendious Effects thereof in many Particu|lars, that &s;hall be mentioned as my own Di&s;covery with re&s;pect to this Excellent Remedy, which will perform Cures with very little Trouble, and without any Charge, and is al&s;o to be had where ever there are any Habitati|ons, which is what can hardly be &s;aid of any other Thing: So that in &s;ome Sen&s;e, Water may be truly &s;ty|led, <HI>An Univer&s;al Remedy,</HI> &s;ince the Di&s;ea&s;es it either prevents or cures may have this Remedy applied to all Per&s;ons, and in all Places where Men do inhabit.</P>

<P><LABEL>Excellency of Water.</LABEL> The fir&s;t Commendation of Common Water that I &s;hall mention, is that which is written concerning it by Dr. <HI>Manwaring,</HI>  in his <HI>Method &amp; Means of enjoying Health</HI>; wherein he &s;aith, That Water is a whole|&s;ome Drink, or rather the mo&s;t whole&s;ome&mdash; being ap|pointed for Man in his be&s;t State: which doth &s;trongly argue that Drink to be the mo&s;t &s;uitable for Human Na|ture &mdash; an&s;wering all the Intentions of common Drinks, for it cools, moi&s;tens, and quencheth Thir&s;t; 'tis clear, thin, and fit to convey the Nouri&s;hment through the &s;malle&s;t Ve&s;&s;els of the Body &mdash; and is a Drink that is a Rule to it&s;elf, and requires little Caution in the U&s;e of it, <HI>&s;ince none will be tempted to drink of it more than needs</HI>: And that in the Primitive Ages of the World, Water-Drinkers, he &s;ays, were the longe&s;t Livers by &s;ome Hundreds of Years&mdash; nor &s;o often &s;ick and complaining as we are.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Keill,</HI> when he treats concerning the Stomach, in his <HI>Abridgment of the Anatomy of Human Bodies,</HI> &s;aith, That Water &s;eems the fitte&s;t to promote Dige&s;ti|on of the Food which we eat; all &s;piritous Liquors hav|ing a Property by which they hurt, rather than help Di|ge&s;tion; the &s;ad Effects of which they are &s;en&s;ible of, he &s;aith, who by a long U&s;e thereof have lo&s;t their Appe|tites, hardly ever to be re&s;tored without drinking Wa|ter, <HI>which &s;eldom faileth of procuring a good Appe|tite and a &s;trong Dige&s;tion.</HI> With which Dr. <HI>Baynard</HI> does agree in that Affirmation,
<Q>That Water liquifies and concocts our Food better than any fomented Li|quor what&s;oever.</Q>
<HI>Hi&s;t. of Cold Bathing,</HI> p. 440.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Prat,</HI> in his <HI>Treati&s;e of Mineral Waters,</HI> &s;hews it to be his Judgment, That if People would accu&s;tom them&s;elves to drink Water, they would be more free from many Di&s;ea&s;es; &s;uch as <HI>Tremblings, Pal&s;ies, Apo|plexies, Giddine&s;s, Pains in the Head, Gout, Stone, Drop&s;y, Rheumati&s;m, Piles,</HI> and &s;uch-like: Which Di|&s;ea&s;es are mo&s;t common among them that drink &s;trong Drinks, and which Water generally would prevent. Moreover, he al&s;o &s;aith, That Water plentifully drank
<PB N="5" REF="002701_0004_0FE5F2E223539058">
<HI>&s;trengthens the Stomach, cau&s;eth an Appetite, pre|&s;erves the Sight, maketh the Sen&s;es lively, and clean|&s;eth all the Pa&s;&s;ages of the Body,</HI> e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the Kidneys and Bladder.</P>
<P>'Tis al&s;o &s;aid by Dr. <HI>Duncan,</HI> in his <HI>Treati&s;e of hot Liquors,</HI> That when Men contented them&s;elves with Water, <HI>they had more Health and Strength</HI>; and that at this Day tho&s;e who drink nothing but Water, are more healthy &amp; live longer than tho&s;e who drink &s;trong Liquors, <HI>which rai&s;es the Heat of the Stomach to Ex|ce&s;s, whereas Water keeps it in a due Temper.</HI> And he adds in another Part of the Book, That <HI>by hot Liquor the Blood is inflamed</HI>; and &s;uch who&s;e Blood is infla|med, live not &s;o long as tho&s;e who are of a cooler Tem|per: <HI>A hot Blood being commonly the Cau&s;e of Fluxes, Rheums, ill Digestion, Pains in the Limbs, Headach, Dimne&s;s of Sight,</HI> and e&s;pecially of <HI>Hysteric Vapours.</HI> He al&s;o imputes the Cau&s;e of Ulcers to a hot Blood, and declares, That if Men kept their Blood cool and &s;weet, <HI>by a moderate and cooling Diet,</HI> they would never be troubled with Ulcers, or other Breakings-out. Which Coolne&s;s of the Blood will be well perform'd by drink|ing a large Draught of Water in the Morning, which will carry off the bilious and &s;alt Recrements by Urine. And if Water is drank al&s;o after Dinner, it will cool a hot Stomach, and prevent the ri&s;ing of tho&s;e Fermenta|tions which cau&s;e Winds and Belching after Meat. So that if Per&s;ons who are liable to the&s;e Di&s;orders, will leave off &s;trong Liquors and a hot Diet, and drink Water, they will procure better Health to them&s;elves than they had before.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>John Floyer</HI> al&s;o, in his <HI>Treati&s;e of Cold Baths,</HI> does affirm, <HI>pag,</HI> 109. <HI>Edit.</HI> 5. That Water-Drinkers are temperate in their Actions, prudent, and ingenious; they live &s;afe from tho&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es which affect the Head; &s;uch as <HI>Apoplexies, Pal&s;ies, Pain, Blindne&s;s, Deafne&s;s, Gout, Convul&s;ions, Trembling, Madne&s;s,</HI> and the drink|ing of Water cures the <HI>Hiccough, Foetor of the Mouth, and of the whole Body, it re&s;i&s;ts Putrefaction, and cools burning Heats and Thir&s;ts, and after Dinner it helps

Digestion.</HI> &mdash; And if the Vertues of Cold Water were &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idered, all Per&s;ons would value it as a Great Medicine, in preventing the <HI>Stone, A&s;thma,</HI> and <HI>Hy&s;teric Fits; and to the U&s;e of this Children ought to be bred up from their Cradles.</HI> And in <HI>Page</HI> 434, he &s;aith, That as Water is in chief the Univer&s;al Drink of the World &mdash; <HI>&s;o it is the best, and most &s;alubrious.</HI> And in <HI>Page</HI> 437, That he hath known where a Regu|lar Drinking of Spring-Water hath done con&s;iderable Cures, by Wa&s;hing off the <HI>acrid, &s;corbutick Salts</HI> from the Blood, and &s;trengthning the <HI>Coats</HI> and <HI>Fibres</HI> of the Stomach and Bowels, <HI>and hath brought on a good Appe|tite, and a &s;trong Digestion.</HI></P>
<P>Having read over an old Book written by one Sir <HI>Tho. Elliot,</HI> intituled, <HI>The Ca&s;tle of Health,</HI> he there decla|red from his own Experience, That in the County of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> tho' it was a very cold Quarter, the Poorer Sort, which in his Time did never, or but very &s;eldom drink any other Drinks but Water, were &s;trong of Body, and lived to a very great Age: to which Relation that of Sir <HI>Henry Blount</HI> is very agreable, who affirmed in his Book <HI>of Travels into the Levant,</HI> (where under the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Government the U&s;e of Wine was forbid, <HI>and where the common Drink is Water</HI>) that he then had a better Stomach to his Food, and dige&s;ted it more kindly than he ever did before or &s;ince.</P>
<P>And in the <HI>Treati&s;e of the Vanity of Philo&s;ophy,</HI> written by Dr. <HI>Gideon Harvey,</HI> it is affirmed by him, That it is not Heat that cau&s;eth a good Dige&s;tion, <HI>but a proper Ferment, or Liquor provided by Nature,</HI> to di&s;|&s;olve the Food into a Sub&s;tance like unto Pap made with fine Flour, which Di&s;&s;olvent, he &s;aith, is much depraved by hot &s;piritous Liquors; and therefore he commends Water above all other Drinks to promote Dege&s;tion.</P>
<P><LABEL>Gout and Hy|pochondriac Me|lancholly.</LABEL> Water drinking is al&s;o &s;aid by Dr. <HI>Allen</HI> to be good to prevent Two Deplorable Di&s;tem|per, the <HI>Gout,</HI>  &amp; the <HI>Hypochondri|ac Melancholly</HI>; For, &s;ays he, the <HI>Gout</HI> is generally cau&s;ed by the too great Drinking of fermented Liquors,
<PB N="7" REF="002701_0006_0FE5F3191C034F78">
<HI>and is never &s;aid to have a&s;&s;aulted any Drinker of Wa|ter</HI>; and he &s;ait<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> al&s;o, That <HI>Melancholly Hippochon|driac is kept off longest by drinking Water instead of &s;trong Drink.</HI> To which let me add. That I once knew a gouty Gentleman, who, to avoid his Drinking Com|panions in <HI>London,</HI> retired to <HI>New Brentford,</HI> where I then lived; in which Town by a very temperate Diet of one Meal a Day, and drinking only Water, he lived two whole Years free from Pain: But being vi&s;ited by one who came that Way, and invited to drink but one Bottle of Claret between them, he fell next Day into a terrible Fit of the <HI>Gout,</HI> which held above a Month after; of which being recovered, he by the &s;ame Cour&s;e conti|nued well till I left the place, which was about a Year and an half after.</P>
<P><LABEL>Gravel.</LABEL> The good Properties of Water are further manife&s;ted in preventing <HI>the breeding of Gravel in the Kidneys</HI>;  for <HI>Zechias,</HI> in <HI>Con&s;ul.</HI> 17. as he is quoted by <HI>Salmon,</HI> affirms, That nothing does &s;o much abate the Heat of the Kidneys, and free them from tho&s;e Recrements which cau&s;e Pain in the Back, <HI>one great Sign of Gravel,</HI> as Water does; but he advi&s;eth <HI>to drink it warm,</HI> by the U&s;e of which, he &s;aith, the un|natural Heat in time will be &s;o extingui&s;hed, that no more of that Matter cau&s;ing Gravel will be produced in the Body. Which A&s;&s;ertion by Experience I have found to be true; for ob&s;erving much Gravel to be voided by me, as al&s;o abundance of Matter floating in the Urine like Bran, with a great Number of Recrements like Cutt|ings of Hair, &s;ome above an Inch long, <HI>which Sub&s;tan|ces were found in all the Water that I made in above Twelve Months</HI>; for which I could get no Remedy: I was advi&s;ed to drink Water, which in about half a Year did intirely free me from tho&s;e Symptoms, which &s;ome out of Ignorance imputed to Witchcraft, &s;o that from that Time to this pre&s;ent I never have been troubled with it.</P>
<P><LABEL>Stone in the Bladder.</LABEL> Water al&s;o is commended as efficacious to prevent <HI>the breeding of the Stone in the Bladder,</HI>  for it hath been ob&s;erved, that
<PB N="8" REF="002701_0007_0FE5F319E37E49D8">
in &s;ome who have been cut for the Stone <HI>that new Stones have been engendered, &s;o that &s;ome young Per&s;ons have been cut &s;everal Times.</HI> Now to prevent this, the drinking Water hath been advi&s;ed with Succe&s;s; for by this that intemperate Heat in the Body was abated which did occa&s;ion the Di&s;temper. Some have advi&s;ed to drink it warm, and others cold, and in particular <HI>Van Heydon,</HI> a Phy&s;ician of <HI>Ghent</HI> in <HI>Flanders,</HI> in his Book, entitled, <HI>Help for the Rich and Poor</HI>; which, he &s;aith, in <HI>p.</HI> 49. is &s;ufficiently in&s;inuated by <HI>Pi&s;o</HI> and <HI>Alexander,</HI> who do a&s;&s;ure us, That the taking a Draught of cold Water in the Morning, hath done &s;o much Good, that &s;everal after the voiding of a Stone never had any more Stones grow in them.</P>
<P>Which Experiment may give Light to the Di&s;covery of a Way to cure the Stone without Cutting; for if the growing of new Stones can be prevented by drinking Wa|ter, let it be hot or cold, <HI>it may prevent a Stone from growing bigger when begun</HI>; and if the adding Matter to increa&s;e a Stone new begun, can be prevented, Nature in Time may wa&s;te that which is begun, e&s;pecially if &s;ome Drops of &s;weet Spirit of Nitre be added to all the Water drank, which will powerfully help to cool, and is known to be an admirable Mover or provoker of Urine, <HI>and will waste a Stone, and make it crumble like Ful|ler's Earth, if applied to a Stone taken from the Body.</HI> Or the Water may be &s;weetned with Honey, which is now much in U&s;e among the Gentry, as I am inform'd by an Ingenious Apothecary; who told me that among them at pre&s;ent, Pump-Water and Honey was in great Repute to give Ea&s;e in Gravel; And there is &s;o near an Affinity between Gravel and the Stone, that what is pro|per for one, will be &s;uitable to both, and will prevent the growing of both.</P>
<P><LABEL>Beneficial in Child|bearing.</LABEL> Water is al&s;o &s;tyled in <HI>Sennertu</HI>'s Works, The Bal&s;am of Children,  the drinking of it by the Mother being one of tho&s;e Things whereby Children may be &s;trengthened in the Womb, and will prevent tho&s;e Injuries that
<PB N="9" REF="002701_0008_0FE5F31D0753A028">
are done them by drinking &s;trong Liquors; which <HI>Samp|&s;on</HI>'s Mother was not allowed to do, for &s;he was com|manded <HI>not to drink Wine or &s;trong Drink,</HI> Judg. xiii. 4. But I will not &s;ay, If all Women &s;hould do this, their Children &s;hall be as &s;trong as <HI>Samp&s;on</HI> was; yet this I will &s;ay, If they would do this, they would find their Children more free from Di&s;tempers and Frowardne&s;s, and &s;o much more ea&s;y to nur&s;e and bring up, and be le&s;s liable to an immature Death; the want of which Ab|&s;tinence from &s;trong Drinks is the Cau&s;e why &s;o may Rich People find it hard to bring up Children, in Com|pari&s;on to what is done by the Poor; For the&s;e la&s;t are born of Mothers who not only are prevented from being Gluttons by their want of <HI>Dainties, which are deceitful Meat,</HI> Prov xxiii. 3. but they &s;eldom ta&s;te Wine or &s;trong Drink; whereas the Rich not only &s;eed high, but they al&s;o drink &s;trong Drinks, which in mo&s;t Con&s;titu|tions do over-heat and corrupt the Humours of the Body, and that Blood by which their Children are nouri&s;hed during their Pregnancy. Which Injury to unborn Infants would be prevented, if the Mother would be temperate in Diet, and drink Water; e&s;pecially at Meals, by which the Blood of the Mother would be kept cool and clean; which mu&s;t needs communicate a healthful Sub&s;tance to the Child within her, and prevent all tho&s;e Di&s;tempers, which Infants do bring with them into the World.</P>
<P><LABEL>Increa&s;es Milk in Women.</LABEL> And here it may be proper to add, <HI>what by divers Experiments hath been found to be true,</HI> That the drinking Water by Nur&s;es while they give &s;uck to Children,  will wonderfully increa&s;e Milk in tho&s;e that want it, <HI>as every one will find,</HI> who can be per&s;waded to make U&s;e thereof. I have advi&s;ed many to make u&s;e of it, who have found that by drinking a large Draught of Wa|ter at Bed-time, they have been &s;upplied with Milk &s;uf|ficient for that Night, when before they wanted it, and could not be &s;upplied by any other Means: And be&s;ides, they who have found their Children re&s;tle&s;s, by rea&s;on of too much Heat in their Milk, do find them much more
<PB N="10" REF="002701_0009_0FE5F3218AB05BD0">
quiet after their Milk is cooled by Water-drinking.</P>
<P><LABEL>Stays Hun|ger.</LABEL> By drinking Water al&s;o, <HI>the Want of Food for a Time may be &s;uffered without Starving</HI>; for I have been informed by a credible Friend,  who was an Officer at Sea, That being &s;ent down to <HI>Stafford</HI> to take Care to &s;ee &s;ome Men conveyed on Shipboard, that had been Pre&s;&s;ed by Act of Parliament for the Sea-Service; he found in the Pri&s;on where they were kept, a lu&s;ty Fellow, who had declared, he would &s;tarve him&s;elf rather than go to Sea, and taking particular Notice thereof, he found upon due Enquiry, that for Twenty Days he had refu&s;ed to eat any manner of Food, only he drank each Day about three Pints or two Quarts of Water, hoping thereby to get him&s;elf di&s;charged: But when he found his Preten&s;ions to be in vain, and that in about two Days they &s;hould all march for <HI>London,</HI> he conde&s;cended to eat &s;ome Food, beginning with a little, and in the March he was ob&s;er|ved to travel as well as the be&s;t Man. I find al&s;o an Ac|count in Dr. <HI>Car</HI>'s <HI>Letters,</HI> of a certain crack-brained Man, who, at <HI>Leyden,</HI> when the Docter re&s;ided in that Univer&s;ity, <HI>pretended he could fa&s;t as long as Chri&s;t did</HI>; and it was found that he held out the Time of For|ty Days without eating any Food, <HI>only he drank Water, and &s;moaked Tobacco.</HI> And I once had a &s;ad Complaint from a poor old Woman of the greatne&s;s of her Want, affirming that oftentimes <HI>&s;he had not eaten any Food for two or three Days</HI>; upon which I asked her, If &s;he did not then &s;uffer much Unea&s;ine&s;s in her Stomach? She &s;aid, &s;he did; but found a Way at la&s;t to a&s;&s;wage her Hunger by drinking Water, which did &s;atisfy her Appe|tite.</P>
<P><LABEL>Strengthens weak Chil|dren.</LABEL> Water is al&s;o of great U&s;e to &s;trenghen weak Children, for we are informed by Dr. <HI>Jo&s;eph Browne,</HI> in his Treati&s;e of <HI>Cures performed by Cold Baths,</HI>  That the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> Women do pre|&s;erve their Children from the <HI>Rickets,</HI> by wa&s;hing them Night and Morning in cold Water, till they are three Quarters of a Year old, <HI>p.</HI> 79.
<PB N="11" REF="002701_0010_0FE5F322B89D2618">
And 'tis &s;aid by Sir <HI>John Floyer,</HI> in his Treati&s;e <HI>of Cold Baths,</HI> That a Lady in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who had lo&s;t &s;everal Children thro' Weakne&s;s, did, by the Advice of a <HI>High|land</HI> Begger Woman, pre&s;erve tho&s;e &s;he had afterwards, by wa&s;hing them Daily in cold Water. And I my&s;elf did advi&s;e a Neighbour, who&s;e Children began to be Rick|etty, to treat the Child in the &s;ame manner; but &s;he, in&s;tead of wa&s;hing, dipped it over Head and Ears every Morning, <HI>it being then in the Summer time</HI>: The Event of which was, the Child became &s;trong, and had a good Countenance, tho' before it was in the Face very pale and wan. Which &s;hews how great the Power of Water is, when u&s;ed outwardly to invigorate the Spirits &amp; &s;trength|en Nature.</P>
<P><LABEL>Swellings from Brui&s;es.</LABEL> It is al&s;o a known Cu&s;tom, <HI>to prevent the Swellings</HI> that follow <HI>Brui&s;es in the Faces of Chil|dren,</HI> by immediately applying thereunto a Linnen Cloath four or &s;ix times double,  dip|ped in cold Water, <HI>and now dipping it as it begins to grow warm</HI>; for the Cold repels or prevents the flowing of Humours to the Part which otherwi&s;e would Cau&s;e great Swelling, and after turn blacki&s;h: And if upon neglecting to do &s;o, a Swelling &s;hould &s;ucceed, it may be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by fomenting Night and Morning, for an Hour at a Time, with Water as hot as can be endured; for that will give Vent to the Hu|mours to tran&s;pire through the Skin, or di&s;&s;olve them, &s;o as to make them capable of returning back.</P>
<P><LABEL>Sickne&s;s at the Stomach.</LABEL> Moreover, by means of Water all Sickne&s;s at the Sto|mach may be cured, which is done thus: Take four Quarts of Water,  make it as hot over the Fire as you can drink it; of which Water let a Quart be taken down at &s;eve|ral Draughts; <HI>then wrap a Rag round a &s;mall Piece of a Stick, till it is about the Bigne&s;s of a Man's Thumb,</HI> tie it fa&s;t with &s;ome Thread; and with this, by endea|vouring gently to put it a little Way down your Throat, provoke your &s;elf to vomit up again mo&s;t of the Water,

<P>Some Few indeed pretend they are not able to vomit by this Means: Now, if they cannot vomit, let them take a Pint of Water when they find them&s;elves ill from eat|ing, and do &s;o every three or four Hours, <HI>eating no more till they are hungry</HI>; and they will find the Water dige&s;t and carry off what was offen&s;ive.

<P>We are told by Sir <HI>John Floyer,</HI> in his <HI>Treati&s;e of Bath and Mineral Springs</HI> That Vomiting with Wa|ter is very u&s;eful <HI>in the Gout, Sciatica, Wind, Shortne&s;s of Breath, Hypochondriac Melancholy, and Falling-Sickne&s;s</HI>; which Di&s;tempers are generally derived from evil Matter contained in the Stomach, as is likewi&s;e

And we find that Dr. <HI>Cockburn,</HI> in his Treati&s;e of <HI>Sea Di&s;ea&s;es,</HI> did order for the Want of Sleep in Fevers, to dip a Towel, four times doubled in <HI>Oxycrat,</HI> which is &s;ix Parts Water, and one Part Vinegar, to be bound about the Head and Temples; which, he &s;aith will cau&s;e Sleep with wonderful Succe&s;s.

Now tho' this is mention'd by him as a probable Opinion, yet Ex|perience in our days &s;hews, <HI>That the plunging the Pa|tient into the &s;alt Water either of the River of</HI> Thames <HI>about</HI> Grave&s;end, <HI>or in the &s;alt Springs in</HI> Che&s;hire, is the be&s;t means to prevent any Evil &s;ucceeding the Bite of a mad Dog; <HI>they mu&s;t indeed be dipt &s;o often, as to be almo&s;t drown'd before the Danger is over</HI>: but 'tis a que&s;tion whether the Saltne&s;s of the Water contributes any thing to this Cure, &s;ince <HI>Boerhaave,</HI> the pre&s;ent Profe&s;&s;or at <HI>Leyden,</HI> affirms, That when Men bitten by a mad Dog are arriv'd to the Fear of Water, call'd an <HI>Hydrophobia,</HI> they may be cured, <HI>by blinding the Pa|tient's Eyes, and throwing of him into a Pond of Wa|ter

But the Patient, when plunged into a cold Bath, ought to continue in the Bath each time about three or four Minutes: for in plunging over head and ears at his fir&s;t Entrance into a cold Bath, the Brain will be &s;o &s;en|&s;ibly affected, as to be relieved from the Di&s;temper, which is a kind of Convul&s;ion proceeding from an Inflamma|tion, or &s;ome other Cau&s;e; <HI>but we want more Expe|riments to confirm this Notion</HI>: Which Notion may be worth noting, that the thing may be tried in others, to &s;ee whether it will &s;ucceed as it did in this Per&s;on.

<P><LABEL>Scurvy.</LABEL> And the plentiful drinking of Water is commended in the Scurvy <HI>whether hot or cold,</HI>  by Dr. <HI>Pit|cairn,</HI> to di&s;&s;olve the Scorbutick Salts, and car|ry them out by Urine, <HI>whether they are Acids or Alkalies</HI>; and my&s;elf having formerly been extreme|ly troubled with the <HI>Scurvy,</HI> which often made me faint and weak, and my Pul&s;e &s;o low as &s;carcely to be felt, did find at la&s;t that the Pul&s;e would infallibly ri&s;e upon drinking a Pint or more of cold Water, <HI>and in a little time I &s;hould again become brisk &amp; &s;trong</HI>: For I have often ob&s;erved, that upon a Di&s;order of the Sto|mach, the Strength of the bodily Members &s;oon would fail, <HI>and as ea&s;ily be recovered when the Di&s;order of the Stomach was removed</HI>; yea, by long Experience, I have found that nothing conduceth &s;o much to bodily Strength as a Stomach in right Order, which requires Temperance &amp; cooling Diet to bring it into Order, when di&s;tempered.</P>
<P><LABEL>A&s;thma.</LABEL> To what hath been already &s;aid,  I will add an Account, taken from a credible Per&s;on, of a Man in the Pari&s;h of <HI>Shoreditch,</HI> who was de&s;perately ill of an <HI>Asthma,</HI> or <HI>Shortne&s;s of Breath,</HI> and <HI>deep Con&s;umption,</HI> for which he had tried many Remedies to no purpo&s;e. At length he was advi&s;ed by a Phy&s;ician, being poor, <HI>to drink no other Drink but Water, and eat no other Food but Water Gruel, without Salt or Sugar</HI>; which Cour&s;e of Diet he continued for three Months, finding him&s;elf at fir&s;t to be &s;omewhat better, and at the three Months end he was perfectly cured: but, for Security-&s;ake, he continued in that Diet a Month longer, and grew &s;trong and fat upon it. <HI>But his Diet he had no
<PB N="33" REF="002701_0032_0FE60DC831EE12F0">
mind to till he was thorowly hungry,</HI> and then he eat it with plea&s;ure; in which perhaps con&s;i&s;ted the be&s;t part of his Cure, it being an Advantage to Health never to eat till Hunger calls for Food.</P>
<P><LABEL>Cough.</LABEL> And I remember a young Woman, a Burni&s;her of Sil|ver, <HI>who had a de&s;perate Cough,</HI> for which &s;he had taken many things of an <HI>Apothecary</HI> to no purpo&s;e;  at length the Journeyman told her, his Ma&s;ter &s;aid, he could do no more: but, &s;aid the Fellow, I would advi&s;e you every Morning to wa&s;h be|hind your Ears, and upon your Temples, and on the Mould of your Head with cold Water; which &s;he told me &s;he did, and was perfectly cured of her Cough by that Means.</P>
<P><LABEL>Difficulty in making wa|ter.</LABEL> There are divers other Ca&s;es wherein the U&s;e of Water hath done much good.  I knew an ancient Practi&s;er in Phy&s;ick, who told me, That in many <HI>Difficulties of making Water,</HI> he advi&s;ed the Party to put his Yard into Water as hot as he could endure it, <HI>which, in a Mi|nute, did cau&s;e him to make water</HI>; and that Women have had the &s;ame Benefit by &s;itting over hot Water. And he often had advi&s;ed them <HI>who were co&s;tive, and went to Stool with great Difficulty,</HI> to &s;it over a Pot with hot Water in it; which &s;oon was attended with an ea&s;y Dejection, or Stool, the Body drawing up the Va|pour, which did provoke Expul&s;ion of Excrements with|out much &s;training.</P>
<P>And it hath been ob&s;erved, that <HI>froward Children have been made much more quiet,</HI> by wa&s;hing their low|er Parts every Morning with Water, to wa&s;h off the Salts of their Urine, which u&s;ually &s;tick in the Pores of the Skin, and are fretful and unea&s;y, <HI>and nothing cures their Sorene&s;s about tho&s;e Parts like it.</HI> Nor is there any thing more effectual to cure Men, <HI>who are gauled with Riding,</HI> than to wa&s;h them&s;elves well, when they go to bed, with cold Water; <HI>and wa&s;hing the bear Breast every Morning with cold Water,</HI> will make tho&s;e hardy who before were apt at every turn to take

Cold. To which I will add this, that Sir <HI>Theodore Mayhern</HI> affirms in his <HI>Medicinal Coun&s;els,</HI> that in mo&s;t Di&s;ea&s;es of the Head, there is nothing better than to bathe it with cold Water, which, in a de&s;perate Pain in the Ears upon taking cold, I have found to be true; for the Pain &s;eemeth to Vani&s;h upon applying to it a|bout 30 Minutes, a Towel doubled up often, and wet in cold Water; and tho' it returned again &s;ome Hours after, yet Ea&s;e was obtained the &s;ame way, and the Cure perfected in four times doing: Which Cure of a Pain gotten with Cold, by a cold Application, will not &s;eem &s;o &s;trange, when we con&s;ider that in the Northern Countries, Mortifications from Cold are no ways to be cured but by applying cold Snow.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, Water when rightly made u&s;e of, doth ap|pear from the Accounts beforementioned, very effectual <HI>to prevent &amp; Cure many Di&s;ea&s;es,</HI> but more e&s;peci|ally the inward U&s;e thereof; for to u&s;e the Words of the ingenious Dr. <HI>Curtis,</HI> in his <HI>E&s;&s;ay for the Pre&s;erva|tion &amp; Recovery of Health</HI>; The habitual U&s;e of Wa|ter for common Drink <HI>pre&s;erves the native Ferment of the Stomach in due Order, keeps the Blood tempe|rate, and helps to &s;pin out the Thread of Life to the longe&s;t Extent of Nature, it makes the Re&s;t at Night more quiet and refre&s;hing, the Rea&s;on and Under&s;tand|ing more clear, the Pa&s;&s;ions le&s;s di&s;orderly; and, in ca&s;e of eating too much, a large Draught of cold Wa|ter va&s;tly exceeds any other Cordial to cau&s;e Dige&s;tion</HI>: Water being not &s;o cold and lifele&s;s, <HI>he &s;aith,</HI> as many do imagine. Be&s;ides which Commendation of it by this Doctor, <HI>'tis certainly a Drink that will not ferment in the Stomach, nor turn &s;our,</HI> as Wine and &s;trong Malt-Drinks will do, to the hindering of a good Di|ge&s;tion, <HI>which all Acidity in the Stomach certainly doth, when it abounds there</HI>; and is be&s;t corrected by weakening or making it le&s;s &s;our, by drinking good Store of Water, <HI>as the Experience of above Forty Years Practice hath a&s;&s;ured my &s;elf and many others.</HI> For tho' Water is accounted a contemptible Drink, yet by beginning to make u&s;e of it at about Thirty Years of

<P><LABEL>U&s;eful in Vomiting.</LABEL> But the chief U&s;e of Water in pre&s;erving of Health,  <HI>is by u&s;ing of it as a Vomit, as before was &s;hewn,</HI> which is an infallible and the mo&s;t &s;peedy Remedy that ever was found out for any Stomach-Sickne&s;s, or Pain there; for to vomit with warm Water will effectually remove it in one Hour, and be a means to prevent great Fits of Sickne&s;s, and pre&s;erve the Lives of many Thou&s;ands to old Age, <HI>by clean&s;ing the Stomach from that tough, &s;limy, or corrupt Matter that offends, and is the

Cau&s;e of all mortal Di&s;ea&s;es</HI>; e&s;pecially of an <HI>Apo|plexy,</HI> which tho' counted a Di&s;ea&s;e of the Head, <HI>yet hath its Original from a foul Stomach,</HI> which nothing doth &s;o effectually clean&s;e as Vomits: according to that of Dr. <HI>Curtis,</HI> who &s;aith, That vomiting with warm Water, or <HI>Carduus</HI> Tea, is very beneficial to bring up that which fluctuates in the Stomach, and that tough, ropy Phlegm which &s;ticks fa&s;t to the Wrinkles and Folds of that Bowel, <HI>and which Purges do often pa&s;s over, and cannot remove.</HI> Which way of Vomiting with warm Water, is ten times more ea&s;y and plea&s;ant than that which is effected by the U&s;e of a nau&s;eous Tea made of <HI>Carduus,</HI> which Phy&s;icians do &s;ometimes ad|vi&s;e; and 'tis al&s;o &s;uch as can do no harm by Violence, as other Vomits made from <HI>Antimony</HI> &s;ometimes do, for want of drinking after each Vomit a Pint or more of Water-gruel, or warm Water, &s;ince you may &s;top when you plea&s;e, by forbearing to drink more warm Water, when you vomit with Water.</P>
<P>And here it may not be ami&s;s to relate what I &s;ome Years ago di&s;covered, in order to Mens freeing them&s;elves from Sickne&s;s that may happen after eat|ing; for being invited to dine at a certain Table, where there were &s;everal good Di&s;hes of Meat, I was over-per&s;waded to eat more than I &s;hould do, and in a little time after Dinner found my &s;elf begin to be &s;ick. I went out and in a private Place attempted to vomit, by tickling my Throat with my Finger, but could not vomit as I de&s;igned to do; only by this means I rai&s;ed up two or three mouthfuls of thick tough Phlegm, upon which <HI>I found my &s;elf better, and my &s;ick Qualm went off.</HI> I took the Hint it gave me, and have done the &s;ame &s;everal times &s;ince, and find that the getting up the Phelgm, <HI>which like Ye&s;t upon Beer, works up to the Mouth of the Stomach</HI> a Man may free him&s;elf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rom &s;ome kinds of Sickne&s;s after eating. And I remember it is an Ad|vice given by one <HI>Vaughan,</HI> in a Book long &s;ince print|ed, intitled, <HI>Directions for Health,</HI> for Men who feed high, <HI>to put their Finger in their Throat when they

ri&s;e in the Morning, to make them&s;elves puke,</HI> or avoid the Phlegm which can be rai&s;ed, as an excellent way to pre&s;erve Health; and 'tis &s;aid al&s;o to be an ab&s;olute Pre|&s;ervative from the <HI>Gout.</HI></P>
<P><LABEL>Gripings.</LABEL> I will conclude with this Note, That in &s;uch Di&s;tem|pers <HI>where Water-drinking will be availa|ble for a Cure,</HI>  the &s;ame mu&s;t not be drank &s;paringly but plentifully, <HI>as</HI> (for in&s;tance) <HI>to ea&s;e the Gripings in a Loo&s;ne&s;s or Flux</HI>: for if but a Pint of Water &s;hould be drank, Ea&s;e would hardly &s;uc|ceed; but drinking in about an hour's time <HI>a Quart or three Pints,</HI> the Sharpne&s;s and evil Quality of the Hu|mour offending will be &s;o far diluted or weakened, that immediate Ea&s;e will follow. <HI>If the Sea&s;on be too cold to drink cold water, you may warm it a little upon the Fire, or put a hot Toa&s;t of Bread in every Pint</HI>: and the &s;ame is true <HI>in Fevers, or in Pains from Gravel or the Cholick</HI>: A &s;mall Quantity will not be effectual in the&s;e Ca&s;es, for in the <HI>Cholick</HI> a Quart is nece&s;&s;ary, <HI>which ought to be carefully noted,</HI> and in a Fever a lit|tle Water will rather increa&s;e the Burhing, which large Draughts, often drank, will &s;oon take off. <HI>Re&s;t, Fa&s;t|ing, and drinking much Water,</HI> after a Vomit or two, is a Cour&s;e that never yet hath failed to cure Fevers, <HI>by clearing the Stomach of that &s;ordid Filthine&s;s which cau&s;eth he Distemper</HI>; for a happy I&s;&s;ue will certain|ly follow &s;uch a Cour&s;e, if the Fever is &s;imple, and not complicated with &s;ch other Di&s;tempers, which will re, &s;i&s;t all Remedies: for in many Ca&s;es nothing can pre|vent Mortality, <HI>as is evident by the Death of the best Phy&s;icians them&s;elves, and by the Death of many, who con&s;ulted with them for a Cure, &s;ince many die under the Hands of the mo&s;t able Doctors, as well as Quacks.</HI></P>
<P><LABEL>Grief.</LABEL> I will add to what hath been &s;aid, one Experiment more, that is very material, And that is, being very <HI>hypochondriacal,</HI>  and of a <HI>melancholly Temper,</HI> I have often &s;trangely dejected in Mind when under Grief for &s;ome Misfortunes, which &s;ometimes have been &s;o great, <HI>as to threaten Danger
<PB N="38" REF="002701_0037_0FE5F39124C6E6D8">
to Life</HI>; in which Fits of Grief I always found the Parts within my Brea&s;t very unea&s;y, and &s;ometimes continu|ed long: but now I have found a good Remedy, <HI>for upon drinking a Pint or more of cold Water, I find ea&s;e in two or three Minutes, &s;o that no Grief &s;eems to afflict.</HI> Which Experience I di&s;cover for the &s;ake of others in the &s;ame Circum&s;tances, being verily per&s;ua|ded that the Stomach &s;ympathizeth with the Mind, and this becomes the Cau&s;e of that unea&s;y Sen&s;ation and Pain perceived there; for which, cold Water I have found to be the be&s;t Remedy in my &s;elf, and I believe others may find the &s;ame Benefit, who will make u&s;e thereof upon the like Occa&s;ion, and it gives al&s;o Relief to People under Frights.</P>
<P><LABEL>Vapours.</LABEL> There is al&s;o another Experiment that I have often &s;een of good effect;  and that is, that if Per&s;ons, &s;ubject to what is called <HI>Vapours,</HI> or that are afflicted with Fits, commonly called, <HI>The Fits of the Mother,</HI> will but drink Water when they find their Fits approach, it will immediately yield Relief. There is in this ca&s;e a mealy Julep pre&s;cribed by Dr. <HI>Bates,</HI> which is to take <HI>a Spoonful of fine Wheat-Flower, an Ounce of fine Sugar, and a Pint of Water, brew them together, and drink it off</HI>: This is plea&s;an|ter than Water alone; but Water of it &s;elf will be as effectual, or rather better, as hath been often proved up|on Per&s;ons in tho&s;e Fits.</P>
<P><LABEL>How to di&s;tingui&s;h Water.</LABEL> Some perhaps may de&s;ire to know how to di&s;tingu&s;h good from bad Water;  &amp; the way to do this, <HI>is by the Ta&s;te &amp; Scent</HI>; for if it have no Ta&s;te nor Smell, being purely fre&s;h, not &s;alt, nor &s;weeti&s;h, nor ill-&s;cented, 'tis good, <HI>pro|vided it be pure &amp; clear</HI>; of which kind is the com|mon Water u&s;ed in <HI>London,</HI> when well &s;ettled, or in fair Weather. As for tho&s;e who are curious, and will be at the Charge, they may procure the be&s;t Water for Drink by <HI>Di&s;tillation,</HI> either in an Alembick, or in a cold Still u&s;ed in drawing any cold Water from Herbs;
<PB N="39" REF="002701_0038_0FE60DC997C799C8">
<HI>for no earthy or metallick Substance, nor any kind of Salt will ri&s;e in Distillation</HI>: &s;o that the Water &s;o di&s;tilled will be pure &amp; admirable to drink when cold, and will keep as long from &s;tinking as any of the cold di&s;tilled Water in the Apothecaries Shops; according to what Dr. <HI>Quincy</HI> hath affirmed about it in his <HI>Di&s;pen|&s;atory.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have not the Convenience of Di&s;tillation, may boil it a little as they do for <HI>Tea</HI>; for then, when kept a while after it is cold, it will become more fine, by &s;uffering any mixture contained in it to &s;ettle to the bottom of the Ve&s;&s;el wherein it is contained, and that will render it &s;till more pure: in &s;hort, all Water that will make a good Lather with Soap, is whole&s;ome to drink without boiling, but none el&s;e.</P>
<P><LABEL>Pains in the Sto|mach.</LABEL> Since the collecting together the forementioned Ac|counts, I have met with a Book written by Dr. <HI>Boerhaave,</HI>  the pre&s;ent Profe&s;&s;or of Phy&s;ick at <HI>Leyden,</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> who affirms, that drink|ing Water, made very warm, is a good Re|medy <HI>to pacify griping Pains in the Sto|mach</HI>; and that 'tis proper to bathe wounds in the Face with it, when they come to be ju&s;t healed, &s;o that the Place be kept continually wet, <HI>which I conceive is be&s;t done by applying often Linnen Cloths wet, and binding them till they begin to be dry,</HI> for this will prevent Scars: And he &s;aith, that warm Water is bet|ter to attenuate, or thin the Blood, than cold Water.</P>
<P><LABEL>Fevers.</LABEL> There is al&s;o publi&s;hed lately a Book of Ex|periments made with Water,  by Dr. <HI>Hancock,</HI> a Divine, called <HI>Febrifugum Magnum</HI>; wherein he &s;aith, that drinking a Pint or Quart of cold Water in Bed, will rai&s;e a copious Sweat, <HI>and cure all burning Fevers,</HI> which at once taking hath done the bu&s;ine&s;s: it will rai&s;e a Sweat without much more covering than ordinary. And he further affirms, that the &s;ame taken <HI>at the be|ginning of the cold Fit of an Ague, and &s;weating up|on it,</HI> at two or three times taking will cure that Di|&s;temper. A large Quantity of hot Water, I know, hath
<PB N="40" REF="002701_0039_0FE5F392C8E04720">
been advi&s;ed to take off the cold Fit of Agues, but the Party was not ordered to &s;weat. Which Di&s;covery of the Reverend Doctor about Fevers, is confirmed by the following Accounts, which I received from a Wor|thy Gentleman. Mr. <HI>Ralph Thoresby,</HI> F. R. S. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Author of <HI>Ducatus Leedien&s;is,</HI> or Topography of <HI>Leeds,</HI> which the learned Bi&s;hop of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> in his Pre|face to the new Edition of <HI>Camden</HI>'s <HI>Britannia,</HI> &s;tiles, <HI>An U&s;eful &amp; Accurate Treati&s;e.</HI>#</NOTE> to whom they were tran&s;mitted by Mr. <HI>Lucas,</HI> a pious and learned Gentleman of <HI>Leeds</HI> in <HI>York&s;hire</HI> who &s;ays that</P>
<Q>One Captain <HI>Ro&s;ier</HI> fell into a violent Fever, which, as &s;oon as he perceived, he &s;aid he mu&s;t have &s;ome cold Water. The Gentlewoman, at who&s;e Hou&s;e he lodged, not thinking that proper, boiled the Water (unknown to him) and put &s;ome Spirits therein, and &s;ent it up cold; but he &s;melt it before it came to his Head, and refu&s;ed to drink it, &s;aying, he knew what he did, for he had &s;everal times tried it. Af|terwards &s;ome clear Water being brought, he drank it, &s;weat profu&s;ely, and was well the next Day.</Q>
<Q>Another Captain of a Ship al&s;o took the &s;ame Me|thod, when he, or any of his Men, fell into a Fever; which had the de&s;ired &s;ucce&s;s.</Q>
<P>Mr. <HI>Lucas</HI> adds, in another Letter to the &s;ame Gentleman,</P>
<Q>That his own Wife fell very ill of a Fe|ver; &s;he drank Water, &s;weat very much, and there|by recovered.</Q>
<P>All which In&s;tances corroborate the new Way of curing Fevers, &s;o lately di&s;covered in this City by Dr. <HI>Hancock</HI>; who al&s;o &s;aith, he has had long Experience of curing <HI>common Colds</HI> with cold Water; and this is done by drinking a large Draught of Water at going to Bed, another in the Night, and another in the Morn|ing: which, he &s;aith, will &s;oon thicken &amp; &s;weeten, and dige&s;t that thin &s;harp Rheum, that provokes Coughing to no purpo&s;e: <HI>for the Rheum, when thin, is hard to
<PB N="41" REF="002701_0040_0FE60DD1C58DFF40">
be brought up</HI>; but when thicken'd, it will come up ea|&s;ily, and the Cough will &s;oon go off. Which agrees with what I before affirmed from my own long Experience.</P>
<P>He al&s;o affirms from his own Experience, that u&s;ing &s;ometimes to take a Walk of eight or ten Miles in a Morning, he found that <HI>Water gave twice as good Breath for that purpo&s;e as Wine or Ale</HI>; and if it would do this for a Man who had no <HI>A&s;thma,</HI> he doubts not but it would do the &s;ame in one troubled with one. And he al&s;o affirms Water to be the be&s;t Remedy <HI>for a Surfeit,</HI> to the truth of which I can te&s;tify by long Experience.</P>
<P><LABEL>Rheuma|ti&s;m.</LABEL> He al&s;o affirms,  that drinking cold Water hath been found good in <HI>Rheumati&s;ms,</HI> and that to one &s;o afflicted he had advi&s;ed to drink it as he lay in his Bed, and it took off the Fit; but if hot Water attenuates the Blood mo&s;t, as <HI>Boerhaave</HI> affirms, 'tis then be&s;t to drink of it warm daily to a good quan|tity: for, as <HI>Pitcairn</HI> ob&s;erves, <HI>'tis then the be&s;t Di&s;&s;ol|ver of all kinds of Salts in the Body,</HI> which it will car|ry off in the Urine, it drank plentifully; for by Urine Salts are evacuated, as is evident by the Ta&s;te.</P>
<P><LABEL>Gout in the Sto|mach.</LABEL> And it is his Opinion,  from the long Expe|rience he hath had of the Effect of Water in keeping the Stomach in order, and making it tite and &s;trong to perform its Operations, and dige&s;t all Humours, that <HI>it will cure the Gout in the Stomach</HI>; and perhaps it may do it better than Wine, <HI>which I have known to fail.</HI> And I do not won|der that the &s;ame Liquor, which is the principal Cau&s;e of the Gout in other Parts, &s;hould not be a help in that Part, but rather kill, <HI>as it often is found to do, tho' the stronge&s;t Wine is drank.</HI></P>

<P>I will here add to what the Doctor hath &s;aid before concerning the Cure of Fevers, that if the Fever be ac|companied in the beginning <HI>with any great Illne&s;s at the Stomach, nau&s;eating or vomiting,</HI> it will be the &s;ure&s;t and &s;afe&s;t Practice to clear the Stomach fir&s;t, by vomiting with <HI>warm Water, as before hath been directed</HI>; for I cannot believe it po&s;&s;ible for the Stomach to be cleared from foul Humours by &s;weating: <HI>it may do, if no great &s;en&s;e of Di&s;order is perceived there,</HI> but it will certain|ly be &s;afe&s;t to clean&s;e the Stomach fir&s;t, <HI>which is the Place where all Di&s;ea&s;es are originally begun</HI>; for then &s;weat|ing with cold Water afterwards may turn to good ac|count. Indeed I have not made any trial of it &s;ince the Doctor's Book was publi&s;hed, but I have a very good o|pinion of his Accounts therein given concerning the Be|nefit of Water, <HI>having had &s;o much Experience thereof in my own Practi&s;e for above forty Years</HI>; for &s;o long it is &s;ince I fir&s;t began to collect tho&s;e Accounts, and make tho&s;e Experiments, which are herein made publick for the Benefit of all.</P>
<P>And thus, for the common Good of Mankind of all Ranks and Degrees, I have gathered together all the Ac|counts I have ob&s;erved in <HI>Phy&s;ick-Books,</HI> relating to <HI>the U&s;e of common Water in preventing &amp; curing Di&s;|ea&s;es</HI>; to which I have added &s;ome Experiments of my own, which by numerous Trials I can warrant as &s;ure and certain, <HI>e&s;pecially that of curing any Sickne&s;s in the Stomach upon the Spot, by vomiting with warm Water</HI>: which is an Experiment, that, if put into com|mon Practice, would prevent many thou&s;and Fits of Sickne&s;s in a Year among Mankind, and al&s;o a great number of untimely Deaths; <HI>for it takes away the Cau&s;e of all Stomach-Sickne&s;s,</HI> which is the Root or fir&s;t Beginning of mo&s;t of the Evils that afflict the Body.</P>

<HEAD>Some <HI>RULES</HI> for pre&s;erving Health by <HI>DIET,</HI> collected from Phy&s;ical Authors.</HEAD>
<P>IN a little Treati&s;e, entitled, <HI>Kitchin-Phy&s;ick,</HI> written by Dr. <HI>Cook,</HI> the Author declares, <HI>he can hardly be told of any Di&s;ea&s;e which he cannot relieve or cure by a proper Diet, p.</HI> 39. And in the &s;ame Book we find his Opinion to be this, That all tender &s;ickly People, and all aged and decrepid Per&s;ons, <HI>ought to eat often, and but a little at a time,</HI> becau&s;e weak and wa&s;ted Bodies are to be re&s;tored by little and little; and by moi&s;t and liquid Food al&s;o, rather than by &s;olid, <HI>becau&s;e moi&s;t and liquid Diet does nouri&s;h &s;oone&s;t, and digest ea&s;ie&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e, he &s;aith, that eat much, and get little Strength by eating, &s;hew, that they have u&s;ed them&s;elves to too full a Diet; <HI>and the more you cramb &s;uch Bodies, the le&s;s they thrive by it, but rather grow wor&s;e and wor&s;e</HI>: becau&s;e by much feeding you do but add to the bad Hu|mours wherewith the Body is already filled, which &s;hould rather be wa&s;ted by purging and u&s;ing a &s;pare Di|et.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="002701_0044_0FE60DD5153CEF78">And a &s;pare Diet he de&s;cribes to be this, <HI>That we never eat at once till the Appetite is fully &s;atisfied, and never to eat till we have an Appetite</HI>; and Men never have a true Appetite till they can eat any ordinary Food: And he advi&s;eth <HI>to keep con&s;tantly to a plain Diet</HI>; for tho&s;e, he &s;ays, enjoy mo&s;t Health, and live longe&s;t, <HI>that avoid Curio&s;ity and Variety of Meats and Drinks,</HI> which only &s;erve to entice to Gluttony, and &s;o work our Ruin.</P>
<P>Another &s;aith, that the le&s;s Food the &s;ick Per&s;on eats, the &s;ooner he will recover; for 'tis a true Saying, <HI>The more you fill foul Bodies, the more you hurt them.</HI> The Stomach being the Place where Di&s;ea&s;es begin, when that Part therefore is weak, and out of order, and can|not make a good Dige&s;tion when much is eaten, raw or crude Humours then mu&s;t needs be bred, and bad Hu|mours cannot produce good Blood.</P>
<P>All Men do find by Experience, that in the Morning before they have eaten, they are light and plea&s;antly ea&s;y in their Bodies, but after they have indulged their Ap|petites with Plenty of Food, they find them&s;elves heavy and dull, and often &s;leepy: which &s;ufficiently &s;hews <HI>that tho&s;e full Meals are prejudicial to the Welfare of the Body</HI>; for a moderate Meal would have continued the Ea&s;e and Light&s;omne&s;s they before found in them&s;elves, and would have refre&s;hed any Faintne&s;s that Emptine&s;s might occa&s;ion. And he certainly, who u&s;eth the mo&s;t &s;imple Meat and Drinks, <HI>avoideth the Snare of provok|ing his Appetite beyond the Nece&s;&s;ities of Nature; whereas Variety enticeth to a fre&s;h De&s;ire of every Dainty,</HI> till at la&s;t the Stomach is gorged, and made un|capable of performing a good Dige&s;tion; and this pro|duceth tho&s;e Crudities, which are the Cau&s;e of all Di&s;|ea&s;es, and of &s;o many &s;udden Deaths.</P>
<P>'Tis generally ob&s;erved, that the mo&s;t unhealthy are found among tho&s;e <HI>who feed high upon the most delici|ous Dainties, and drink nothing but the &s;trongest and most &s;pirituous Liquors</HI> whereas others who want this delicate Fare, are &s;eldom &s;ick, except they have &s;uch un|&s;atiable
<PB N="46" REF="002701_0045_0FE60DAFB0F04E18">
Appetites as to eat too much; which a Man may do of the plaine&s;t Diet; <HI>who&s;e Belly is his God,</HI> as an Apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;es it. But tho' Men may glut them&s;elves with coar&s;e Food, yet coar&s;e Food and long Life are ve|ry Con&s;i&s;tent, as appears by <HI>John Bill,</HI> mention'd in the Hi&s;tory of Cold Baths, <HI>p.</HI> 408 who&s;e Food was Bread, Chee&s;e and Butter; and Drink, Whey, Butter-milk or Water; and yet he lived 133 Years, was a &s;trong, &s;trait, upright Man. And the Food of <HI>John Bailes,</HI> who&s;e Age amounted to 128, was for the mo&s;t part brown Bread and Chee&s;e, and his Drink, Water, or &s;mall Beer and Milk, <HI>p.</HI> 416. He had buried the whole Town of <HI>Northampton</HI> twenty times over, except three or four, and &s;aid &s;trong Drink killed them all.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Pratt</HI> advi&s;eth to Sup &s;paringly; for to Sup &s;par|ingly, he &s;aith, is mo&s;t healthful, <HI>becau&s;e of the Experi|ence of an infinite Number of Per&s;ons who have receiv|ed the greatest Benefit from light Suppers.</HI> For the Stomach being not over-burdened, the Sleep is more plea&s;ant; and from &s;paring Suppers the breeding of tho&s;e Humours are prevented, which Cau&s;e <HI>Defluxions, Rheu|mati&s;ms, Gouts, Drop&s;ies, Giddine&s;s, and Corruption in the Mouth from the Scurvy</HI>: and from light Suppers a Freedom from Sickne&s;s and Reaching in the Morning is obtained, and Concoction is made perfect, which prevents Ob&s;tructions.</P>
<P>Another &s;aith, It is well known, that <HI>many Indi&s;po|&s;itions are cured by Fa&s;ting, or a very &s;pare Diet</HI>; for what is taken into the Stomach being no more than can be well dige&s;ted, the chylous Juice, &s;o rightly prepared, is conveyed into the Lacteal Ve&s;&s;els, and from thence into the Blood: &s;o that Nature being duly &s;upplied with well-concocted Nouri&s;hment, the corrupted Blood will free it&s;elf from that Corruption in time, by throwing it out, through the Pores of the Skin, in Per&s;piration, and &s;upply it&s;elf with the purer Juices; and in this way, <HI>Con|&s;umptions and Scurvys,</HI> and other Chronical Di&s;temp|ers, will be overcome: which way of curing Di&s;ea&s;es by Fa&s;ting, Swine do naturally betake them&s;elves to, who,
<PB N="47" REF="002701_0046_0FE60DE46D8872C8">
when &s;ick, will eat nothing till they recover, as they al|ways do after they injure them&s;elves by over-eating; in which they are imitated by all who delight in Gorman|dizing or Gluttony, tho' not in u&s;ing the &s;ame means of Recovery.</P>
<P>That Men in Health may prevent Di&s;ea&s;es, 'twas ad|vi&s;ed, that one Meal &s;hould not be eaten, till the other, which was eaten before, was pa&s;&s;ed off clean out of the Stomach; <HI>which never is done till the Appetite of Hun|ger is found to call for another Supply</HI>: by means of which con&s;tant Ob&s;ervation, the Food will be converted into good Chyle, and from good Chyle, <HI>which is a mil|ky Sub&s;tance</HI> good Blood will be bred, and from good Blood generous Spirits will be produced, <HI>out of which a healthy Con&s;titution will en&s;ue</HI>; but, on the contrary, too great a Quantity of Food being taken <HI>for plea&s;ure only,</HI> which the Stomach cannot well dige&s;t, the Chyle will be raw and corrupt, which will foul the Blood, and render the Body di&s;orderly and unhealthful.</P>
<P>Others &s;ay, that Ab&s;tinence and Sobriety free from mo&s;t Di&s;ea&s;es, e&s;pecially <HI>Catarrhs, Coughs, Whee&s;ings, Giddine&s;s, Pain in the Head and Stomach, &s;udden Death, Lethargies, Gout</HI> and <HI>Sciatica,</HI> an ill Dige&s;tion being the Cau&s;e of all the&s;e; it al&s;o prevents <HI>Pain in the Spleen, Stone, and Gravel, and a day Itch</HI>; it makes the Body vigorous and nimble, maintains the five Sen&s;es in a good State, pre&s;erveth the Memory, quick|ens the Wit, and quencheth all undue Lu&s;t in Mankind; and, in &s;hort, all Mi&s;ers, who eat and drink but little, live long.</P>
<P>Two Meals a day is &s;aid to be &s;ufficient <HI>for all Per|&s;ons after fifty Years of Age, and all weak People</HI>; and the omitting of Suppers does always conduce much to the Health <HI>of the Weak and Aged</HI>: &s;ince if no Sup|per be eaten, the Stomach will &s;oon free it&s;elf from all tough &s;limy Humours wherewith it is &s;labbered over on the In&s;ide, and thereby the Appetite will be renewed, and Dige&s;tion made more &s;trong and vigorous. More|over, all that are troubled with <HI>Sweating in the Night, any ill Ta&s;te in their Mouths, belching, and trouble&s;ome
<PB N="48" REF="002701_0047_0FE60DB2B7B30880">
Dreams,</HI> mu&s;t avoid Suppers: for in Sleep the Fibres of the Stomach relax, and are not able to contract them|&s;elves &s;o &s;trongly, as when awake, to embrace the Food, and by Trituration reduce it into a Pan fit to pa&s;s out into the other Bowels, called <HI>the Guts,</HI> out of which the Nouri&s;hment is &s;ent to other Parts.</P>
<P>'Twas &s;aid by Dr. <HI>Curtis,</HI> that though tho&s;e who u&s;e a &s;pare Diet, cannot well bear long Labour; <HI>yet &s;uch People, when their Exerci&s;e is &s;uitable to their Strength, do live longer than tho&s;e of a robu&s;t Constitution, that think large feeding adds Strength</HI>; e&s;pecially &s;uch as being &s;trong, u&s;e no Exerci&s;e proportionable to it, to conaume the Superfluities which a full Feeding doth oc|ca&s;ion: &s;o that the only way for tho&s;e to live long, who have much Wealth, and need not labour for a Livelihood, is to live temperately: and this Temperance doth con&s;i&s;t in not letting the common Cu&s;tom of Meals invite you to eat, <HI>except your Appetite concur with tho&s;e Times.</HI> We mu&s;t not indulge the Cravings of a depraved Appe|tite, <HI>as tho&s;e do who eat to plea&s;e their Fancy, and not the Nece&s;&s;ities of Nature</HI>; and when we do eat, we mu&s;t not think that the more plentifully we eat, we &s;hall be more &s;trengthened, for it will not prove &s;o: <HI>a little well digested will make the Body &s;tronger,</HI> than the being glutted with Superfluity, mo&s;t of which will be turned into a corrupt Juice, and mu&s;t be ca&s;t out by Phy|&s;ick, or el&s;e Sickne&s;s will en&s;ue, and the ea&s;ie&s;t Phy&s;ick is that which the <HI>Germans</HI> call the <HI>Hunger Cure,</HI> if continued a due time.</P>
<P>It is the Opinion of <HI>learned Men,</HI> that the early Di|&s;temper of the Bodies of Children, called <HI>the Rickets,</HI> proceeds from the Fault of their Mothers, <HI>in making them Gluttons from their Cradles,</HI> gorging them with Food till they loath it, out of a mi&s;taken Opinion, <HI>that this is the way to make them thrive and grow &s;trong</HI>: which Exce&s;s is not only the Cau&s;e of this Di&s;ea&s;e, but of the immature Death of many; and in others it lays the Foundation of many Di&s;tempers, which afflict tho&s;e afterwards who live to Years of Maturity: and as they gorge them with Food, &s;o they vainly think to cheri&s;h
<PB N="49" REF="002701_0048_0FE60DF29FA6FF30">
them with &s;trong Drink, <HI>than which nothing can be more pernicious to the Health of Children,</HI> who&s;e Diet &s;hould be little and often, and their Drink cooling. As it al&s;o &s;hould be when Men arrive at the time <HI>of becom|ing Children again in Old Age</HI>; that is, in an helple&s;s State, which &s;hould be prevented as much as can be, <HI>by a cooling moistening Diet, in oppo&s;ition to the hot &amp; dry, and withered State of Age</HI>; for 'tis Heat and Dryne&s;s that are the Cau&s;e of mo&s;t old Mens Mi&s;eries, e&s;pecially the wa&s;ting of the Sub&s;tance that fills the Parts with Moi&s;|ture, and keeps the Body plump and &s;mooth; they who &s;tile Wine the old Man's Milk, being greatly mi&s;taken, for Milk cools, and Wine heats.</P>
<P>It was the Opinion of Dr. <HI>Pitt,</HI> who was formerly Phy&s;ician to St. <HI>Bartholomew's Ho&s;pital, that Fa&s;ting, Rest, and drinking Water</HI> would cure mo&s;t Di&s;ea&s;es; <HI>and there &s;eemeth to be a great deal of Rea&s;on in what he a&s;&s;erted.</HI> For Fa&s;ting will give time to the Stomach to unload it&s;elf of the Cau&s;e of Di&s;tempers, <HI>the Cau&s;e of all Di&s;ea&s;es being begun in that Bowel only</HI>; to which clean&s;ing, the drinking of Water plentifully will much contribute, which al&s;o will keep the Action of the Sto|mach upon the Hinges, <HI>by filling of it when empty,</HI> at which time there will be need of Re&s;t, for thereby the Body will be le&s;s fit for Bu&s;ine&s;s: tho' the mere drinking of Water, <HI>which affords Nouri&s;hment &s;ufficient for the Growth and Support of all Vegetables,</HI> will, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;upply the want of Food, <HI>as hath been &s;hewn in the Example of two, who were &s;upported a long time by nothing el&s;e.</HI> In &s;hort, the be&s;t way for a &s;ink Man to recover, is to eat little or no Food till he finds an Appetite, according to that Saying,
<Q><L>Spare Diet will the most Di&s;ea&s;es cure,</L>
<L>If a due Time you can the &s;ame endure.</L></Q>
And fa&s;ting from Food may be continued long enough to be a Remedy for many Di&s;ea&s;es, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of common Water; by the drinking of which warm, in a due Quantity, without a total Fa&s;ting, <HI>two Per&s;ons, I
<PB N="50" REF="002701_0049_0FE60DDE73049BA0">
am informed, were recovered out of Con&s;umptions,</HI> with which they were extreamly weakened, and that in about &s;ix Weeks time; as was another <HI>by drinking Milk and Whey, equal Parts, made blood-hot without u&s;ing any other Diet,</HI> which is thought to be far more effectual than A&s;&s;es Milk, who&s;e Virtue con&s;i&s;ts in being thinner than other Milk.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides a &s;pare Diet, cool dry Air is al&s;o very helpful to pre&s;erve Men in Health, who are not &s;ick, for it mixes with the Blood, and without it the Motion of the Blood and Spirits can never be pre&s;erved, as ap|pears by <HI>Diving-Ve&s;&s;els,</HI> in which Men cannot live when the Air therein is made hot by their own Body and Breath: And is proved al&s;o by an Experiment of Dr. <HI>Croone</HI>'s, who &s;tifled a Chicken, till it &s;eem'd quite dead; <HI>and yet by blowing cool Air into the Lungs, with a &s;mall Pair of Bellows, it revived.</HI> Hence it appears that the common Cu&s;tom of managing &s;ick People is ve|ry pernicious, and &s;o far from helping them to recover, that 'tis &s;ufficient <HI>to make a healthy Per&s;on &s;ick</HI>; for were a Per&s;on, who was not &s;ick, confined for three or four Weeks in a Room, made hot like a Stove, and kept in his Bed, with the Curtains drawn, and all the Windows clo&s;e &s;hut, and the Room made unplea&s;ant with the nau|&s;eous Fumes of Phy&s;ick, and a clo&s;e-&s;tool, <HI>which will almo&s;t make a fre&s;h Man &s;ick when he ju&s;t enters into it</HI>; we can never think that this is the way to recover one that really is &s;ick, and wants the fre&s;h Air and revi|ving Scents to cheri&s;h his Blood; <HI>a fre&s;h open &s;weet Air being one principal means to &s;trengthen the Body, make a good Appetite &amp; Dige&s;tion, &amp; render the Spirits brisk and lively</HI>: which Advantage &s;hould be allowed to all but <HI>Childbed Women,</HI> &amp; tho&s;e who are afflicted with the <HI>Small-Pox</HI>; for the fre&s;h Air can be prejudicial to no other, who&s;e Bodies are clothed warm, either in Bed, or &s;itting in a Chair in their Chamber.</P>
<P>Some Years &s;ince a Neighbour became very feveri&s;h, and his Wife per&s;uaded him to go to Bed; and hearing of it &s;oon after, I gave him a Vi&s;it, where I found the Windows clo&s;e &s;hut, the Curtains of the Bed drawn,
<PB N="51" REF="002701_0050_0FE5F2CF26407718">
and the Room very hot, <HI>for it was in</HI> July: he was burning hot, <HI>and complained for want of Breath.</HI> I drew open the Curtains, covered him warm, and then opened the Windows, &amp; the Wind blew into the Room; upon which he &s;oon told me his Shortne&s;s of Breath had left him. <HI>I per&s;uaded him to drink &s;ome Water,</HI> which he found did much refre&s;h him; and after I had taken my Leave of him, he called for more Water: And while he had the Cup in his hand, <HI>an Apothecary came in,</HI> whom his Wife had &s;ent for, who, finding him about to drink the Water, told him, if he did it he was a dead Man; but in&s;tead of forbearing, he drank it up in his Pre&s;ence: Upon which the other took his Leave, and told him, he would &s;ay no more to him. However, before Night, the Per&s;on got up, went abroad, and was cured of his Fever; which is one In&s;tance, <HI>among many others which might be given,</HI> of the Benefit of fre&s;h Air to a Per&s;on who is kept warm in his Bed; for thereby his Body was cooled inwardly, and his Breathing made more free by the Air which was drawn into his Lungs to refre&s;h and comfort the Blood as it pa&s;&s;ed through them.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add, <HI>that by keeping the Blood cool as well as clean,</HI> is to be under&s;tood, not only Moderation in Diet, but to feed mo&s;t on cooling Food made of <HI>Wheat, Barley, Oatmeal, Rice,</HI> and ripe <HI>Apples,</HI> as al|&s;o on <HI>Milk</HI>; which, joined with Oatmeal, is the chief Food of tho&s;e lu&s;ty and &s;trong Men, the <HI>Highlanders of Scotland,</HI> who abound in Children, as Dr. <HI>Cheyne</HI> tells us in his Treati&s;e of the <HI>Gout, p</HI> 108. <HI>Edit.</HI> 4. which demon&s;trates Milk and Oatmeal to be a mo&s;t &s;trengthen|ing Food, and &s;uch as keeps the Blood in due Order; &s;o that therewith Men may &s;ub&s;i&s;t, though they ab&s;tain from <HI>Beef, Pork, and Veni&s;on,</HI> and all other Meals hard to dige&s;t, and drink Water <HI>as the Highlanders do</HI>: Of the Efficacy of which cooling <HI>Milk Diet,</HI> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>Cheyne,</HI> gives a notable In&s;tance in a Doctor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> at <HI>Croydon, p.</HI> 103. who had been afflicted with <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Evil;</HI> for, by &s;low Ob&s;ervation, he found <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> his Meals were, the lighter were his Fits.

and the Intervals longer; and finding his Di&s;ea&s;e mend, <HI>as its Fuel was withdrawn,</HI> he took to vegetable Food and Water only, <HI>which put an entire Period to his Fits without any Relap&s;e</HI>: but finding that Food windy to him, he took to Milk, of which he eat a Pint for Break|fa&s;t, a Quart at Dinner, and a Pint for Supper, <HI>without Fi&s;h, Fle&s;h, Bread, or any strong or &s;pirituous Liquor,</HI> or any Drink but Water, with which he lived afterwards for fourteen Years, <HI>without the least Interruption in his Health, Strength, or Vigour,</HI> but died afterwards of a <HI>Pleuri&s;y.</HI> Which is a Confirmation of what Dr. <HI>Cook</HI> did affirm, of the Po&s;&s;ibility of curing Di&s;ea&s;es by Diet only that is temperate and cooling.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, Temperance or a &s;pare Diet, void of Dain|ties, never was injurous to the &s;tronge&s;t Con&s;titution, and without it, &s;uch as are weak &amp; &s;ickly cannot long &s;ub&s;i&s;t; for the more &s;uch Per&s;ons eat &amp; drink, the more weak and di&s;ordered they will &s;till find them&s;elves to be: <HI>So that if the &s;trong de&s;pi&s;e Temperance, yet the Comfort of weak, &s;ickly, and pining People, does depend entire|ly upon their con&s;tantly ob&s;erving it</HI>; which, when they are accu&s;tomed to it, will be ea&s;y to do: &s;o that they will deny all intemperate De&s;ires with as great Plea&s;ure, as they before did delight in what is fal&s;ely &s;tiled good Eating and Drinking; <HI>for nothing of that is good, which is injurious to Health,</HI> 'tis Cu&s;tom only that makes Men hanker after Gluttony and Drunkenne&s;s, and a con|trary Cu&s;tom will make Men abhor it as much: And therefore 'tis a Wonder the Rich do not &s;trive to attain it; for
<Q><L>A fatal Error 'tis in Men of Wealth,</L>
<L>To feed &s;o high as will destroy their Health.</L></Q>
Temperance being that which will enable them to live mo&s;t at ea&s;e, and enjoy their Wealth the longe&s;t; this, and Water-drinking, being the &s;ure&s;t way to bring Men to Old Age, tho' it hath not power to make the Aged young.</P>
