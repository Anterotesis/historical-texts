<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Scheme of a Public Ho&s;pital for the Reception of the poor Sick of this Government and City, is a Subject, which for a long Time pa&s;t, has employed the Attention of many charitable and benevolent Inhabitants; particularly of tho&s;e Gentlemen engaged in the practice of Phy&s;ic, and Offices of Religion, who&s;e Profe&s;&s;ions afford them the mo&s;t frequent Opportunities of knowing the great Nece&s;&s;ity there is for &s;uch an In&s;titution.</P>
<P>In particular, a Plan has often been propo&s;ed, and the mo&s;t proper Method for putting it in Execution con&s;idered, by a Set of Medical Gentlemen, who have formed them&s;elves into a Society for promoting the Knowledge, and extending the U&s;efulne&s;s of their Profe&s;&s;ion: and it has been a Re&s;olution entered upon the Minutes of that Society, from its fir&s;t In&s;titu|tion, that they &s;hould Addre&s;s the Legi&s;lature upon that Subject, on the fir&s;t favourable Op|portunity.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="011168_0006_0F857EEADA9D4350">
It likewi&s;e has repeatedly been mentioned by the different Profe&s;&s;ors of Medicine, (particu|larly Doctors Middleton, and Jones,) in their public Lectures, and earne&s;tly recommended to the Con&s;ideration of the Inhabitants; the unhappy Di&s;putes however, in which we have lately been engaged with our Mother Coun|try, have hitherto rendered their Endeavours fruitle&s;s; but, they neverthele&s;s (convinced of the great Nece&s;&s;ity there was for &s;uch an In|&s;titution, and the very great Advantages which all Orders of People mu&s;t derive from it) re|&s;olved to per&s;i&s;t in their Endeavours, until &s;ome happy Occa&s;ion &s;hould offer of pu&s;hing it with &s;ome Probability of Succe&s;s. Such an Occa|&s;ion now pre&s;ents it&s;elf, and the Warmth and Zeal, which his Excellency the Governor, and mo&s;t of his honorable Council, have expre&s;&s;ed for it, and the Liberality, with which they have &s;ub&s;cribed towards it, induce them to think the pre&s;ent, the fitte&s;t Time, for recom|mending it, to the &s;erious Con&s;ideration of the Public.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="011168_0007_0F857EEE99FF1EF0">
And as an In&s;titution of this Nature, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be calculated for the Benefit of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed of all Sects and Per&s;ua&s;ions what&s;o|ever, it is hoped, that the generous and pub|lic &s;pirited of every Denomination, will enter warmly into the De&s;ign, and promote it with that Zeal, which &s;hould actuate the Brea&s;t of every Man, who thinks it his Duty to relieve the Nece&s;&s;ities of his Fellow Creatures, or pro|mote the Happine&s;s of Society.</P>

<Q><HI>Homines ad Deos, nulla re proprius accedunt, quam Salutem Hominibus dando.</HI>
<BIBL>CICERO.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><HI>There is nothing by which a Man approaches nearer to the Per|fections of the Deity, than by re&s;toring the Sick, to the En|joyment of the Ble&s;&s;ings of Health.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THAT this Country has, ever &s;ince its Di&s;covery and Settlement, laboured under the greate&s;t Di&s;advantages, from the imperfect Manner, in which Students have been in&s;tructed in the Principles of Medicine; and from the Con&s;equent prevailing Ignorance of but too many of its Profe&s;&s;ors; is a Truth which cannot be conte&s;ted; and of which many unhappy Families have &s;everely felt the fatal Effects.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="011168_0009_0F857EEF89946098">
The pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion therefore mu&s;t give the mo&s;t real Plea&s;ure to every con&s;iderate Man, or Lover of his Country; and &s;urely there is no Friend of Learning, but mu&s;t rejoice to &s;ee the&s;e Gentlemen, who have given the mo&s;t public and ample Te&s;timony of their Abilities, now &s;oliciting the Honors of this Univer&s;ity, in a Profe&s;&s;ion hitherto (at lea&s;t in a regular Man|ner) uncultivated among&s;t us.</P>
<P>I am therefore particularly happy in having this Opportunity of congratulating every public &s;pirited Friend and Patron of this College, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the medical In&s;titution, up|on the pre&s;ent In&s;tance of its Succe&s;s, which affords &s;o plea&s;ing a Pro&s;pect of its ri&s;ing Re|putation and future Utility.</P>
<P>But it is to you, Gentlemen, who are Can|didates for medical Degrees, that I mean in a more particular Manner to addre&s;s my pre|&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e; receive then my Thanks for the Honors you have already reflected upon us, and as both for your Sakes and our own, I cannot but be anxious for your future Repu|tation;
<PB N="3" REF="011168_0010_0F857EF022BEB2F8">
let me once more, before we part, re|que&s;t your Attention for a few Moments, whil&s;t I endeavour to explain to you the weighty duties of your Profe&s;&s;ion&mdash;A Pro|fe&s;&s;ion, in the Practice of which, Integrity and Abilities, will place you among the mo&s;t u&s;e|ful; and Ignorance and Di&s;hone&s;ty, among the mo&s;t pernicious Members of Society.</P>
<P>And be not alarmed, if I &s;et out with tell|ing you, that your Labours mu&s;t have no End. No le&s;s than Life, and its greate&s;t Ble&s;&s;ing Health, are to be the Objects of your At|tention; and would you acquit your&s;elves to your own Con&s;ciences, you mu&s;t &s;pend <HI>your</HI> Days in a&s;&s;iduous Enquiries, after the Means of rendering tho&s;e of others long and happy.</P>
<P>Do not therefore imagine, that from this Time your Studies are to cea&s;e; &s;o far from it, you are to be con&s;idered as but ju&s;t entering upon them; and unle&s;s your whole Lives, are one continued Series of Application and Im|provement, you will fall &s;hort of your Duty. For, if in the Eye of the Law, the Man who does not afford, to all immediately under his
<PB N="4" REF="011168_0011_0F857EF0DD6494F8">
Care and Protection, as far as in him lies, the nece&s;&s;ary Means of pre&s;erving Life, is con&s;i|dered as acce&s;&s;ary to Murder, how will that Phy&s;ician excu&s;e him&s;elf to his own Con&s;ci|ence, or what Palliation of his Guilt, will he plead at the awful Bar of eternal Ju&s;tice, who in&s;tead of embracing and indu&s;triou&s;ly cultiva|ting every Opportunity of Improvement, &s;hall (con&s;cious of his own Inability) ra&s;hly tamper with the Lives of his Fellow Creatures; and, at the ri&s;k of their Safety, defraud them of their Property? Would not any one con&s;ider the Lawyer an Impo&s;tor, not to u&s;e a har&s;her Phra&s;e, who, con&s;cious of his own Ignorance, &s;hould give Advice, which might endanger the E&s;tate of another? And is not the Phy&s;ician who impo&s;es Ignorance upon me for Know|ledge, and puts my Life to the hazard of an uncertain die; &s;o much the greater Impo&s;tor, in as much as my Life, is of greater E&s;tima|tion than my E&s;tate. In a Profe&s;&s;ion then, like that you have embraced, where the Ob|ject is of &s;o great Importance as the Life of a Man; you are accountable even for the Errors of Ignorance, unle&s;s you have embraced every Opportunity of obtaining Knowledge.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="011168_0012_0F857EF1AF6EF990">
And to a Man, who has any Con&s;cience at all, it will be but a &s;light Alleviation of his Remor&s;e, to &s;ay, after &s;ome fatal Blunder, <HI>I knew no better!</HI> Unle&s;s he can likewi&s;e add, that it is to be attributed to the Frailty of his Nature, and not to the Negligence of his Di&s;|po&s;ition, that he was not better informed. Nor will a weeping Parent receive much Con&s;ola|tion from this Reflection, that by the fatal Ig|norance of his Phy&s;ician, and not by the ma|lignancy of the Di&s;ea&s;e, he has been robbed of the Staff and Support of his Life, the Joy and Comfort of his declining Age.</P>
<P>Did I know a Wretch among the Practiti|oners of Medicine, who&s;e in&s;en&s;ible Soul nei|ther feels for the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es he may Occa&s;ion, nor partakes in the Joys he may give ri&s;e to; I &s;ay, did I know a Man &s;o void of every Sen|timent of Tenderne&s;s, and Humanity; I would advi&s;e him, from Motives of Intere&s;t and Gain, to endeavour at the Attainment of Skill in his Profe&s;&s;ion. But to you, Gentlemen, I will point out the Gratification in&s;eparable from the Acqui&s;ition of Knowledge, that ever to be
<PB N="6" REF="011168_0013_0F857EF262AC30B0">
wi&s;hed for Prai&s;e, which falls from the Lips of the Wi&s;e and the Virtuous, the Applau&s;e of an approving Con&s;cience, and the un&s;peakable Plea&s;ure of doing good, as the Reward of all your Toil, and as the &s;tronge&s;t Spur to your future Indu&s;try.</P>
<P>As to tho&s;e who have neither Emulation nor Hone&s;ty, who neither have Abilities, nor will give them&s;elves the Trouble of acquiring them; I would recommend it to &s;uch, &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider the Sixth Commandment,</P>
<P>'THOU SHALT DO NO MURDER.'</P>
<P>In the Pro&s;ecution of your Studies, let &s;uch Authors as have tran&s;mitted to us Ob&s;ervations founded upon Nature, claim your particular At|tention. Of the&s;e, HIPPOCRATES &s;hines the foremo&s;t; his unwearied Diligence in ob&s;erving and collecting the Symptoms of Di&s;ea&s;es, his Fidelity and Accuracy in relating them, his happy Facility in di&s;covering their Cau&s;es, his almo&s;t prophetic Knowledge of their Events, and his &s;ucce&s;sful Treatment of them, can ne|ver be &s;ufficiently admired, and will hand down his Name, with Honor and Applau&s;e to the late&s;t Po&s;terity.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="011168_0014_0F857EF34DAEF1E8">
A few others among the Ancients, who have followed the Steps of Hippocrates, are well worth your Peru&s;al; but whil&s;t you ac|knowledge <HI>their</HI> Merit&punc; do not affect the Pe|dantry of de&s;pi&s;ing the Moderns; and carefully avoid that Rock, upon which mo&s;t of the fond Admirers of Antiquity have &s;plit, a blind and &s;lavi&s;h Attachment to its Opinions; the Bar where Truth has been &s;o often Shipwrecked, and which more than the want of Ingenuity or Capacity, &s;topped the Progre&s;s of Learning for above twelve hundred Years.</P>
<P>Why &s;hould we give more to tho&s;e Times, than they attributed to them&s;elves? Read the Writings of the wi&s;e&s;t among the Ancients, and they are filled with Mode&s;ty and Diffi|dence, why then &s;hould we a&s;cribe to them, Infallibility and Omni&s;cience? They doubted the A&s;&s;ertions, and controverted the Opinions of the Times which preceded them; why &s;hould not we doubt and controvert theirs; and leave to Po&s;terity the Liberty of controverting ours? Let us then examine their Writings with Candour, but with Freedom, and embrace or
<PB N="8" REF="011168_0015_0F857EF417C99598">
reject their Opinions; as they &s;hall be found con&s;i&s;tent, or incon&s;i&s;tent with later Expe|rience.</P>
<P>Without therefore depreciating the Merit of the Ancients, let us do Ju&s;tice to their Po&s;|terity, and do not from an over Zeal for Anti|quity, &s;acrifice Sydenham and Boerhaave, to the Manes of Hippocrates and Galen.&mdash;I &s;ee no Rea&s;on why Time only &s;hould le&s;&s;en our Abilities, and &s;urely Experience mu&s;t increa&s;e our Knowledge: and although I think &s;ome of the Ancients may be read with great Ad|vantage; yet it is the mo&s;t celebrated Moderns (who with equal Abilities enjoy the additional Advantage of near 2000 Years of Experience) whom I would recommend to your mo&s;t at|tentive Peru&s;al; particularly tho&s;e great Orna|ments of their Profe&s;&s;ion, SYDENHAM, BOER|HAAVE, HUXHAM, PRINGLE, and WHYTT; and &s;ome others of our late&s;t Engli&s;h and Scotch Phy&s;icians, <HI>"Horum Scripta nocturna ver&s;ate manu, ver&s;ate diurna."</HI></P>
<P>In your Intercour&s;e with your Fellow Prac|titioners, let Integrity, Candour, and Delicacy
<PB N="9" REF="011168_0016_0F857EF78088D358">
be your Guides. There is a particular Sen&s;i|bility of Di&s;po&s;ition, which &s;eems e&s;&s;ential to delicate Honor, and which I believe is the be&s;t Counterpoi&s;e to Self-Intere&s;t. This I would by all Means advi&s;e you to cultivate, as you will meet with many Occa&s;ions where it only can direct your Conduct.</P>
<P>Never affect to de&s;pi&s;e a Man for the want of a regular Education, and treat even harm|le&s;s Ignorance, with Delicacy and Compa&s;&s;ion, but when you meet with it joined with fool|hardine&s;s and Pre&s;umption, you mu&s;t give it no quarter.</P>
<P>On no Pretence whatever, practice tho&s;e little Arts of Cunning and Di&s;&s;imulation, which to the Scandal of the Profe&s;&s;ion, have been but too frequent among&s;t us. Nor ever attempt to rai&s;e your Fame on the Ruins of another's Reputation; and remember that you ought not only to be cautious of your Words, a Shrug or a Whi&s;per, the &s;tare of Surpri&s;e, or a piteous Exclamation of Sorrow, more effec|tually wound another's Reputation, and more clearly betray the Ba&s;ene&s;s of a Man's own Heart, than the loude&s;t Expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="011168_0017_0F857EF858CBFDF0">
Do not pretend to Secrets, Panacea's, and No&s;trums, they are illiberal, di&s;hone&s;t, and in|con&s;i&s;tent with your Characters, as Gentlemen and Phy&s;icians, and with your Duty as Men&mdash;For if you are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any valuable Re|medy, it is undoubtedly your Duty to divulge it, that as many as po&s;&s;ible may reap the Be|nefit of it; and if not, (which is generally the Ca&s;e) you are propagating a Fal&s;ehood, and impo&s;ing upon Mankind.</P>
<P>In your Behaviour to the Sick, remember always that your Patient is the Object of the tendere&s;t Affection, to &s;ome one, or perhaps to many about him; it is therefore your Duty, not only to endeavour to pre&s;erve his Life, but to avoid wounding the Sen&s;ibility of a tender Parent, a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Wife, or an affectionate Child. Let your Carriage be humane and at|tentive, be intere&s;ted in his Welfare, and &s;hew your Apprehen&s;ion of his Danger, rather by your A&s;&s;iduity to relieve, than by any har&s;h or brutal Expre&s;&s;ions of it. On the other hand, never buoy up a dying Man with groundle&s;s Expectations of Recovery, this is at be&s;t a good natured and humane Deception, but too often

it ari&s;es from the ba&s;er Motives of Lucre and Avarice: be&s;ides, it is really cruel, as the &s;troke of Death is always mo&s;t &s;everely felt, when unexpected; and the grim Tyrant may in general be di&s;armed of his Terrors, and ren|dered familiar to the mo&s;t timid, and appre|hen&s;ive; either by frequent Meditation, by the Arguments of Philo&s;ophy, or by the Hopes and Promi&s;es of Religion. But even overlook|ing the important Concerns of Futurity; the Bu&s;ine&s;s of this Life may render &s;uch a Con|duct highly dangerous and criminal; as tho&s;e to whom the thoughts of Death are painful, are too apt when flattered with the Pro&s;pect of Recovery, to neglect the nece&s;&s;ary Provi|&s;ion again&s;t a Di&s;appointment, and by that Means involve their Families in Confu&s;ion and Di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Above all Things, avoid any ridiculous Ex|pre&s;&s;ions of Humour, at the bed-&s;ide of a &s;ick Man; you cannot chu&s;e a more un&s;ea&s;onable Opportunity for your Mirth; nor will you find a Per&s;on of a generous and benevolent Di&s;po&s;i|tion, who can &s;mile even at the Repetition of a
<PB N="12" REF="011168_0019_0F857EF920DBCDE0">
Wittici&s;m, which carries with it the Appear|ance of &s;o much Inhumanity.</P>
<P>Let your Pre&s;criptions be &s;imple, and as neat and agreeable as the Nature of the Remedy will permit&mdash;Nothing can be more ab&s;urd than the Farrago of &s;ome, nothing more di&s;gu&s;tful than the Slovenline&s;s of others; for it is impo&s;&s;ible to learn the true Virtues of Medicines, from com|pound Pre&s;criptions; and Inelegance frequent|ly di&s;appoints us of their Effects.&mdash;And as it is probable, from the Mode of Practice in this Country, that you will not only be the Pre&s;cri|bers, but likewi&s;e the Di&s;pen&s;ers of your Me|dicines, let your Integrity be proof again&s;t the Temptation of unnece&s;&s;arily multiplying Pre|&s;criptions, and tru&s;t rather to the Liberality of your Patient, than to the Quantity of your Phy&s;ic, for your Reward. For altho' perhaps by this Method you may &s;ometimes think your Services undervalued, yet you will always en|joy the &s;uperior Satisfaction of con&s;cious Rec|titude, which, by an hone&s;t Man, will ever be preferred to a trifling Emolument.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="011168_0020_0F857EF9DE24F310">
In the Infancy of this Country, the pre&s;ent Mode of practi&s;ing Medicine was nece&s;&s;arily introduced, from the Scarcity, both of Inha|bitants and Phy&s;icians. But in &s;o populous a City as this, it is beyond a Doubt, that the Regulations it is now under, are both injurious to the Inhabitants, and di&s;honorable to the Profe&s;&s;ion: yet I confe&s;s it is not very ea&s;y to point out a Remedy to the Inconveniences at|tendant on it. There is but one, and that per|haps at pre&s;ent would not be thought expe|dient; but until it is, tho&s;e who are in good Circum&s;tances mu&s;t rely wholly upon the In|tegrity of their Phy&s;icians; and for the Poor who are the greate&s;t &s;ufferers, we mu&s;t en|deavour to find out &s;ome other Source of Relief.</P>
<P>Whenever you &s;hall be &s;o unhappy as to fail, in your Endeavours to relieve; let it be your con&s;tant Aim to convert, particular Mi&s;|fortunes into general Ble&s;&s;ings, by carefully in&s;pecting the Bodies of the Dead, inquiring into the Cau&s;es of their Di&s;ea&s;es, and thence
<PB N="14" REF="011168_0021_0F857EFA9F10B688">
improving your own Knowledge, and making further and u&s;eful Di&s;coveries in the healing Art.</P>
<P>Nor can I help regretting the many Ob|&s;tacles you will meet with in pro&s;ecuting this &s;o nece&s;&s;ary an Enquiry; from the Prejudices of the People in general, and a fal&s;e Tender|ne&s;s and mi&s;taken Delicacy in Relations. Time and Per&s;everance however mu&s;t overcome po|pular Prejudices, and will I hope before long, remove the&s;e Difficulties, and open this Door to Medical Improvement.</P>
<P>Let tho&s;e who are at once the unhappy Vic|tims, both of Poverty and Di&s;ea&s;e, claim your particular Attention; I cannot repre&s;ent to my|&s;elf a more real Object of Charity, than a poor Man with perhaps a helple&s;s Family, labouring under the complicated Mi&s;eries of Sickne&s;s and Penury. Paint to your&s;elves the agonizing feelings of a Parent, whil&s;t labour|ing under &s;ome painful Di&s;ea&s;e, he beholds a helple&s;s Offspring around his Bed, in want of the nece&s;&s;aries of Nature; imagine the De|&s;pair of an affectionate Wife, and a tender

I cannot however help regretting, the very frequent Opportunities you will meet with, particularly in this Place, of exerci&s;ing your Humanity upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions; owing to the want of a proper A&s;ylum, for &s;uch unhappy and real Objects of Charity, it is truly a reproach, that a City like this, &s;hould want a public Ho&s;pi|tal, one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary chari|table In&s;titutions that can po&s;&s;ibly be imagined.</P>
<P>The labouring Poor are allowed to be the &s;upport of the Community; their Indu&s;try enables the Rich to live in Ea&s;e and Affluence, and it is from the Hands of the Manufacturer we derive, not only the Nece&s;&s;aries, but the Superfluities of Life; whil&s;t the poor Pittance he earns will barely &s;upply the Nece&s;&s;ities of Nature, and it is literally by the &s;weat of his Brow, that he gains his daily Sub&s;i&s;tance; how

<P>Nor would the good Effects of an Ho&s;pital be wholly confined to the Poor, they would extend to every Rank, and greatly contribute to the Safety and Welfare of the whole Com|munity. Every Country has its particular Di&s;ea&s;es; the Varieties of Climate, Expo&s;ure, Soil, Situation, Trades, Arts, Manufactures, and even the Character of a People, all pave the Way to new Complaints, and vary the Ap|pearance of tho&s;e, with which we are already acquainted; Hence AEgypt is &s;ubject to the Plague; Holland to Intermittents; the We&s;t-Indies to Putrid; and the Northern Countries to inflammatory Di&s;ea&s;es; and Spain and England to Hypochondriocal Complaints; which reigning Di&s;ea&s;es of a Country, not only have Peculiarities of their own, but often vary the Characters of &s;uch as are com|mon to that Country with others, and the&s;e Peculiarities with their Antidotes can properly

be learned only in public Ho&s;pitals, where ha|ving a number of Sick at one Time, not only affords an Opportunity of the better comparing and remarking their Symptoms, but they be|ing under a certain Di&s;cipline and Regulation, the Faces of their di&s;ea&s;es are not changed, either by the indulgence of friends or the offi|ciou&s;ne&s;s of Nur&s;es; which is too often the ca&s;e in private practice. Another argument, (and that by no means the lea&s;t,) for an In&s;ti|tution of this Nature, is, that it affords the be&s;t and only means of properly in&s;tructing Pupils in the Practice of Medicine; as far therefore, as the breeding good and able Phy&s;icians, which in all Countries and at all Times has been thought an object of the highe&s;t Impor|tance, de&s;erves the Con&s;ideration of the Pub|lic, this In&s;titution mu&s;t likewi&s;e claim its Pro|tection and Encouragement.</P>
<P>Nor is the Scheme of a Public Ho&s;pital I be|lieve &s;o impracticable, nor the Execution of it, I hope at &s;o great a di&s;tance, as at fir&s;t &s;ight it may appear to be. There are Numbers in this Place I am &s;ure (was a Sub&s;cription once &s;et on foot,

Such a one I hope e'er long to &s;ee ri&s;e up among&s;t us, and may the Ble&s;&s;ing of the Poor, and the Applau&s;e of the Good and Humane, be the Reward of his A&s;&s;iduity and Labour.</P>
