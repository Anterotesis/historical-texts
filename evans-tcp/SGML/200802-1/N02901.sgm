<P>There are &s;everal Rea&s;ons why GOD or JESUS CHRIST is Offended with Churches when it is &s;o.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Becau&s;e 'tis very di&s;honouring to God, when Churches do leave their fir&s;t or former Love to him, or decay in it.</HI> GOD is the only &s;uitable Object of &s;upream Love, He only being an ab&s;olute &amp; an infinite Good, <HI>There is none good but one, that is God,</HI> Mat 19.17. And to love the Lord our God with all the heart, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is the proper and commanded Acknowlegement of his Excellency &amp; Goodne&s;s. Such a love to God puts the Crown on his head (if we may, &s;o &s;peak.) It proclaims him the be&s;t good, Exalteth him above all. And tho' in|deed there cannot be in a Creature, love to God, proportioned &amp; adequate to the Good|ne&s;s &amp; Worthine&s;s of the Object; yet if it be
<PB N="16" REF="003473_0010_0FF8491CB26DB6B8">
proportioned to the Powers &amp; Capacities of the Agent, it gives great glory to him. And there are the &s;ame Rea&s;ons always remaining and binding per&s;ons thus to Prai&s;e the Lord. What rea&s;on there ever was for any per&s;on to love God with all their hearts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> there is to continue their love to him, in the &s;ame degree from day to day and for ever. He is immutably good, his Excellencies do not de|cay his Beauties do not wither. And when per&s;ons leave their love to him or decay in it, they treat him, as tho' either it was through Mi&s;take they &s;et their love upon him, and that he was not a Being of &s;uch Worth as they did expect he had been; or that if he was &s;o, yet now tho&s;e Excellencies were de|cayed or lo&s;t; Either of which is di&s;honour|ing to God and &s;o offen&s;ive.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Becau&s;e they who do &s;o, give God's glory to &s;ome other.</HI> They who do not &s;et their chief Love upon God, place it on &s;omething el&s;e. All have their Trea&s;ure their chief good. Some are lovers of Plea&s;ures more than lovers of God, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.4.

And this is offen&s;ive to God, who will not endure his glory &s;hould be given to another, nor his prai&s;e to any creature.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="17" REF="003473_0010_0FF8491CB26DB6B8">
3. <HI>Becau&s;e it is a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of his Command and Law.</HI> God's Law extends to the inner man; And God who is a Spirit and &s;eeth the actions of the Soul as well as tho&s;e of the Body, doth e&s;pecially in&s;i&s;t upon the inner man's being in &s;ubjection to him. Prov. 23.26. <HI>My Son, give me thy heart, &amp;c.</HI> And, <HI>Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,</HI> &amp;c. That they who leave their love to God, or decay in it, they tran&s;gre&s;s the Law; and this being in a main point, yea the very &s;um of all it is a virtual tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the whole Law, &amp; ju&s;tly &amp; greatly offen&s;ive to God.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Becau&s;e in withdrawing their Affections from God, they deal Perfidiously with him.</HI> He Requireth and Commandeth that men love him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that they cleave to him.

Deut. 11.22. <HI>For if ye &s;hall diligently keep all the&s;e com|mandments which I command you to do them, to love the Lord your God, to walk in all his ways and to cleave unto him.</HI> And hence they who take God to be their God, they do Engage this, if they take him as he offereth him&s;elf: And when they do leave or decay in their love to God, they deal deceitfully &amp; fal&s;ly in
