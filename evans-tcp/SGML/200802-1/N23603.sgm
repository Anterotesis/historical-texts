<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE intention of this publication is to di&s;&s;eminate the TRUTH of the EVERLASTING GOSPEL, in its rich variety of doctrine, pre|cept, experience and hi&s;tory, both by pro&s;e and ver&s;e, in a manner calculated to gratify the more &s;ublime ta&s;te, and to in&s;truct the plaine&s;t capacity. In a day of di&s;&s;ipation, infidelity and error, like the pre&s;ent, when, by precept and example, our youth, of every de&s;cription, are indu&s;triou&s;ly prejudiced again&s;t the vo|lume of REVELATION; and while many pro|fe&s;&s;ors of religion &s;tart a&s;ide into <HI>new paths,</HI> too many efforts, in every agreeable form, cannot be made to defend the truths of PRI|MITIVE CHRISTIANITY, and to lead the &s;eri|ous enquirer to ta&s;te its &s;acred &s;treams which
<PB N="iv" REF="031228_0004_0FEB733345BF5BF8">
lead him to God, refine his &s;oul, regulate his life, &s;upport him under &s;ufferings, and ani|mate his hope in pro&s;pect of a bli&s;sful immor|tality!</P>
<P>How far the efforts of the EDITOR of the <HI>Chri&s;tian's Pocket Library</HI> may have an&s;wered the&s;e purpo&s;es, he leaves with God, and the public. It is, however, with greatful plea|&s;ure he reviews the long li&s;t of re&s;pectable SUBSCRIBERS to this WORK, and from thence pre&s;umes his labours have not been unac|ceptable, nor in vain. Thus prompted, he ventures, under the &s;miles of IMMANUEL, and the farther encouragement of his pious READ|ERS, upon the publication of another volume.</P>

<HEAD>Explanation of the <HI>VIGNETTE</HI> upon the Title Page.</HEAD>
<P>IN the centre is a figure of JESUS CHRIST, our ADORABLE SAVIOUR, accompanied by MERCY and JUSTICE.</P>
<P>JUSTICE, in her left hand, poi&s;es a pair of &s;cales: one of which contains the two tables of the MORAL LAW;&mdash;the other a BUBBLE, emblematical of man in his fallen &s;tate. The latter, being weighed in the balance, is <HI>found wanting.</HI> JUSTICE re|ceives from CHRIST a Cro&s;s, repre&s;enting his own SACRIFICE. This &s;he accepts, and by her inverted SWORD, pronounces &s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>MERCY, on the right hand of our SAVIOUR, re|ceives from him an <HI>Olive-branch,</HI> the well known emblem of PEACE, and a &s;ure pledge of his love to &s;inners, to be publi&s;hed among all nations.</P>

SIN contaminated the heart;&mdash;by &s;in the delightful vi|&s;ion of God in Nature was lo&s;t;&mdash;man became alienated from the life of God, and expo&s;ed to all the mi&s;eries incurred by reiterated tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. Reduced to &s;uch a ma&s;s of depravity and guilt, no wonder that man mi&s;take the true nature, object, and means of happine&s;s! As by the carnal prin|ciple of the heart objects are &s;elected and embrac|ed, which promi&s;e that &s;ort of felicity which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ongenial with its own nature, it is to be expected that &s;uch in the pur&s;uit will meet with di&s;appoint|ment, &s;hame and grief. Not to enumerate the variety of means which men pur&s;ue after happine&s;s, it is &s;ufficient to &s;ay, it con&s;titutes the grand bu&s;i|ne&s;s of all orders and ranks of men; and this is the very &s;pring which keeps the whole <HI>world</HI> in motion.</P>
<P>As the&s;e reflections on human nature are too true to admit of controver&s;y, it may not be im|proper to a&s;k, "What, in man's pre&s;ent &s;tate, can re&s;tore to him that happine&s;s which the capa|cious powers of his &s;oul are capable of enjoying?" As a <HI>&s;inner,</HI> he mu&s;t have a full pardon from his JUDGE; as a depraved &s;ubject, his mind mu&s;t be

illuminated, and his pa&s;&s;ions refined; as a traveller through the thorny path of life, he needs &s;ome thing adequate to &s;upport him, and bring his mind into acquie&s;cence with his lot; as a creature im|mortal, and ha&s;tening to a future &s;tate, he mu&s;t have a&s;&s;urance that after death he &s;hall be tran&s;mit|ted to the bo&s;om of JEHOVAH, where alone, &s;in|le&s;s, undi&s;turbed happine&s;s reigns. Where then can the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings be obtained? Go, &s;earch the volumes of Nature,&mdash;alas! not a line in her ex|ten&s;ive page can a&s;&s;ure a &s;inner there are pardons with his JUDGE. Go, pa&s;s through all the &s;cenes of di&s;&s;ipation, honor, wealth, with all the world calls good and great, and &s;ee if a balm can be procured adequate to heal the guilty con&s;cience, or meliorate the heart. Here Nature her&s;elf becomes dumb, and the &s;eats of royalty are found the very regions of anxiety, di&s;appointment and pain. Turn then to the volume of REVELATION; there learn that to re&s;tore human happine&s;s God freely gave his BELOVED SON to &s;u&s;tain that weight of <HI>mi&s;ery</HI> we incurred by our &s;in; that <HI>he who knew no &s;in, was made &s;in for us, that we might be made the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in him.</HI> 2 Cor. v.21. <HI>Though he was rich, for our &s;ake he became poor, that we through his poverty might be rich.</HI> 2 Cor. viii.9.

death, and triumphant re&s;urrection, de|rived from his union with the DEITY, he did not make our happine&s;s po&s;&s;ible, but <HI>actually</HI> obtain|ed it. Heb. ix.11, 12. In Je&s;us is depo&s;ited all that grace which our depraved nature can demand, to re&s;tore its felicity. Through HIM the &s;ublime plea&s;ures of communion with God, as a COVE|NANT EVERLASTING FATHER, is enjoyed, a &s;en&s;e of who&s;e adopting love diffu&s;es in our brea&s;t the mo&s;t inexpre&s;&s;ible delight! From Je&s;us, by his SPIRIT's aid, we may daily receive light, peace, joy, love, &s;trength, with every other virtue to adorn our minds, &s;upport us under &s;uffering, and ani|mate us in obedience. All the vici&s;&s;itudes of Pro|vidence, whether pro&s;perous or adver&s;e, we learn, are in the hand of HIM who bought us with his blood; and the&s;e, however contrary to human ap|prehen&s;ion, <HI>&s;hall work together for the good of tho&s;e who love him.</HI> And the &s;ame adored IMMA|NUEL, by his conque&s;t over <HI>death, hath brought life and immortality to light,</HI> and unfolds to us the brighte&s;t &s;cenes of unutterable bli&s;s! 2 Tim. i.10.

<HEAD>MEMORIAL Of the Lord's Vi&s;itation to the <HI>CITY OF NEW-YORK,</HI> by a malignant <HI>Fever,</HI> which &s;wept away, by death, &s;even hundred and forty-&s;ix Inhabitants, from the <HI>26</HI>th of July till the <HI>5</HI>th of November, <HI>1795.</HI></HEAD>

<P>THE judgment we deplore is one of the &s;wifte&s;t and mo&s;t tremendous calamities that can fall upon a people: It evidently is "<HI>The Lord's voice to the city,</HI>" and demands our &s;olemn attention. Surely there was a cau&s;e&mdash;"<HI>God doth not willingly afflict the children of men.</HI>" This city was growing in opulence, and indulged with every privilege, civil and religious, which could con&s;titute our happine&s;s. Let us then a&s;k if our gratitude has been propor|tionate to our obligation? It is with extreme re|gret we review the too many in&s;tances of pride, luxury, di&s;content, avarice, and di&s;&s;ipation, which have increa&s;ed with our years. Who but mu&s;t drop a tear on recollecting the a&s;toni&s;hing growth of infidelity, and the many attempts to traduce the per&s;on and go&s;pel of the Son of God, by whom alone we can be &s;aved! and it is with &s;till greater &s;en&s;ibility we behold the extreme indifference paid

by profe&s;&s;ors to the life, power and pro&s;perity of the pure primitive truth and wor&s;hip of chri&s;tianity! Thus, <HI>Becau&s;e iniquity abounds the love of many waxeth cold.</HI> Matt. xxiv.13. That this hath long been the unhappy &s;tate of our city, many, many of the more &s;erious of different religious denomi|nations have acknowledged with grief. God could not behold us without &s;ome tokens of his di&s;plea&s;ure. On the 20th of September, 1793, our inhabitants fled to the &s;anctuary to implore the Divine protec|tion from a &s;evere judgment which then pervaded a neighbouring city, and threatened our borders;&mdash; then did every heart tremble, and every eye flow with tears: <HI>but the Lord was intreated for the land, the plague was &s;tayed,</HI> and we were pre|&s;erved. 2 Sam. xxiv.25. That the &s;ight of this cha&s;ti&s;ing rod did not produce its de&s;ired effect, is evident by our Lord's laying upon us his &s;everer hand. He commi&s;&s;ioned not a foe again&s;t us which could have been driven from our borders by force of arms, but
<Q><L>"&mdash;A victor, whose unbounded force</L>
<L>"O'er bulwarks breaks with unresisted course;</L>
<L>"A thousand ways the swift <HI>contagion</HI> takes,</L>

<PB N="8" REF="031228_0013_0FEB734E8C1765E0">
Many, with &s;wift precipitation, fled from their ha|bitations, while the horrors of death &s;at on the brow of tho&s;e who were left behind. Slow, yet &s;teady to his purpo&s;e, the foe advanced; and, oh! who is competent to de&s;cribe his awful &s;poils? Blooming youths, once the joy of their parents, and the hope of their country, cut down and lodged in the re|ce&s;&s;es of corruption! How many per&s;ons of the mo&s;t brilliant parts were arre&s;ted by the polluting hand of Pe&s;tilence, and the public forever deprived of their u&s;eful virtues! The parent, how &s;hall I &s;peak it! the tender parent, not only called to mourn over his departed babe, but compelled, by the law of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, to fly from the putrid corp&s;e of <HI>her</HI> who once lay in his bo&s;om with delight!&mdash; Dictated by humanity in relieving others by every kind office in their power, how many
<Q><L>"&mdash;Caught their friend's departing breath,</L>
<L>"Join'd in the dark society of Death?</L>
<L>"They took one melancholy last embrace,</L>
<L>"Then slept together in the arms of Peace."</L></Q></P>
<P>O Lord, &s;urely thou art known by the judg|ments which thou executeth. May it never be &s;aid of us, "This people turneth not to him that &s;miteth them, neither do they &s;eek the Lord of Ho&s;ts." I&s;a. ix.13. Although our affliction has been great,
<PB N="9" REF="031228_0014_0FEB7354DF54B4C8">
and never to be forgotten, yet, neither &s;o great as we ju&s;tly merited, nor as Philadelphia experienc|ed. Let us remember if this vi&s;itation leaves us without &s;alutary effects, God hath &s;till more ar|rows in his quiver, more keenly pointed, and more &s;wift in flight. In the year 79 three cities were de&s;troyed by an earthquake in <HI>Cyprus.</HI> In 1456, by the &s;ame me&s;&s;enger of ju&s;tice, 40,000 people were lo&s;t in <HI>Naples.</HI> And, in 1665, there died of the plague, in <HI>London,</HI> 68,600 inhabitants. I&s;aiah, when <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> were in&s;en&s;ible of the judgments of God upon them, declared, <HI>Thou &s;halt be vi&s;it|ed of the Lord of Ho&s;ts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noi&s;e; with &s;torm and tem|pe&s;t, and the flame of devouring fire.</HI> I&s;a. xxix.6. Who will not fear before this great and terrible JEHOVAH! Let us, therefore, ince&s;&s;antly pray, that this &s;evere judgment may be &s;ucceeded by co|pious &s;howers of the riche&s;t grace! that magi&s;trates may rule in the fear of the Almighty; mini&s;ters preach with additional zeal; our congregations walk more &s;en&s;ibly in the light of the Lord, and multi|tudes be converted unto our God!

<HEAD>AN INSTANCE OF THE POWER OF DIVINE GRACE.</HEAD>

<P>AFTER the battle of Bergen, in Germany, April 10, 1759, among the many wounded who were brought into Frankfort upon the Mayne&punc;
<PB N="16" REF="031228_0021_0FEB7369E5A11A38">
there w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s the Right Honorable George Charles Dyke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, Baron, Lieutenant-General of the Saxon troops, in the &s;ervice of the King of France. He was born of an ancient and noble family, in Sile&s;ia, April 10, 1710, &s;o that it was ju&s;t on his birth-day that he received his wound. He was of equal abi|lities as a mini&s;ter in the clo&s;et, and a general in the field: In his younger years he had gone through a regular cour&s;e of &s;tudy in the univer&s;ity, and made a great proficiency in philo&s;ophy, e&s;pecially in ma|thematics; afterwards he &s;tudied polemic divinity, till he rea&s;oned him&s;elf into an infidel.</P>
<P>During his illne&s;s, he &s;hewed not the lea&s;t de&s;ire for pious company, or &s;erious di&s;cour&s;e, till the &s;ur|geon let his valet-de-chambre know that he could not live long. The man then a&s;ked his ma&s;ter whe|ther he did not chu&s;e to be vi&s;ited by a clergyman? He an&s;wered with warmth, I &s;hall not trouble tho&s;e gentlemen; I know well my&s;elf what to be|lieve and do. His man, not di&s;couraged, continu|ed thus, My lord, have you ever found me want|ing in my duty, all the time I have been in your &s;ervice? He an&s;wered, No. Then, replied he, I will not be wanting now; the &s;urgeons count you pa&s;t recovery, but every one is afraid to tell you &s;o; you &s;tand on the brink of eternity; pray, Sir, order a clergyman to be called. He pau&s;ed a little,
<PB N="17" REF="031228_0022_0FEB736B6F8A2698">
but &s;oon gave his hand to the &s;ervant, thanked him for his hone&s;ty, and ordered him to &s;end for me.</P>
<P>When I came, the man plainly told me the ge|neral was a profe&s;&s;ed infidel. I went in, and, after a &s;hort compliment, &s;aid, I am told, my lord, your life is near an end, therefore I pre&s;ume, without any more ceremony, to a&s;k you one plain que&s;tion: Is the &s;tate of your &s;oul &s;uch, that you can enter|tain a &s;olid hope of &s;alvation? He an&s;wered, Yes. On what do you ground this hope? He replied, I never committed any wilful &s;in; I have been liable to frailties; but I tru&s;t in God's mercy, and the merits of his Son, that he will have mercy upon me. The&s;e words he uttered very &s;lowly, e&s;peci|ally the merits of his Son. I made the following reply: I am apt to believe you are not tainted with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t vices, but I fear you a little too pre|&s;umptuou&s;ly boa&s;t of never having committed wil|ful &s;in; if you would be &s;aved, you mu&s;t acknow|ledge your being utterly corrupted by &s;in, and con|&s;equently de&s;erving the cur&s;e of God, and eternal damnation. As to your hoping for God's mercy through the merits of his Son, I beg leave to a&s;k you, Do you believe God has a Son&mdash;that his Son a&s;&s;umed our nature, in order to be our Saviour&mdash; that in the execution of his office he has given am|ple &s;atisfaction for us, and recovered our title to

heaven? He an&s;wered, I cannot now forbear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> more minute de&s;cription of the &s;tate of my &s;oul; let me tell you. Doctor, I have &s;ome knowledge of philo&s;ophy, by which I have cho&s;en for my&s;elf a way of &s;alvation: I have always endeavored to live a &s;ober life, to the uttermo&s;t of my power, not doubting but the Being of all beings would then graciou&s;ly accept me. In this way I &s;tood in need of Chri&s;t, and therefore did not believe on him; but if I take the &s;cripture to be a divine revelation, this way of mine I perceive is not the right one; I mu&s;t believe on Chri&s;t, and through him come to God. I replied, You &s;ay, <HI>if</HI> you believe the &s;criptures to be a divine revelation. He fetched a deep &s;igh, and &s;aid, O God! thou wilt make me &s;ay, <HI>becau&s;e</HI> I take the &s;cripture to be thy word. I &s;aid, There are grounds and rea&s;ons enough to determine the di|vine origin o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hri&s;tianity, as I could &s;hew from its mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential principles, were not the period of your life &s;o &s;hort; but we do not now need that diffu&s;ive method; faith being the gift of God, a poor &s;inner tottering on the brink of eternity, has not time to inquire about grounds and rea&s;ons: ra|ther betake your&s;elf to earne&s;t prayer for faith, which, if you do, I doubt not but God will give it you. I had no &s;ooner &s;poken the&s;e words, but, putting off his cap, and lifting up his hands and
<PB N="19" REF="031228_0024_0FEB7373B33C5D10">
eyes, he cried out, O almighty God! I am a poor cur&s;ed &s;inner, worthy of damnation; but, Lord Je&s;us, eternal Son of God, thou died&s;t for my &s;ins al&s;o, it is through thee alone I can be &s;aved. O give me faith, and &s;trengthen that faith! Being extremely weak, he was obliged to &s;top here. A little after he a&s;ked, Is faith enough for &s;alvation? Yes, Sir, &s;aid I, if it be living faith. Methinks, &s;aid he, it is &s;o already; I perceive it will be more &s;o by and by; let us pray for it.</P>
<P>Perceiving he was very weak, and to give him &s;ome re&s;t, I retired into the next room; but he &s;oon &s;ent to call me. I found him praying, and <HI>Je&s;us</HI> was all he prayed for. I reminded him of &s;ome &s;criptures treating of faith in Chri&s;t, and he was much delighted with them; indeed he was quite &s;wallowed up by the grace of Je&s;us, and would hear of nothing but Je&s;us Chri&s;t and him crucified. He cried out, I do not know how it is with me; I never in my life felt &s;uch a change; I have power to love Je&s;us, and to believe in him, whom I &s;o long rejected. O my Je&s;us, how merciful art thou to me!</P>
<P>About noon I &s;tept home; but he &s;ent for me directly; &s;o that I could &s;carce eat my dinner. We were both filled with joy, as the partakers of the &s;ame grace which is in Je&s;us; and that in &s;uch a
<PB N="20" REF="031228_0025_0FEB73757B5B7EE0">
manner, as if we had been acquainted together for many years.</P>
<P>Many officers of the army came to &s;ee him con|tinually, to all of whom he talked freely of Je&s;us, of the grace of the Father in him, and of the power of the Holy Gho&s;t through him; wondering with|out cea&s;ing at his having found Je&s;us, and at the happy change, by which all things on this &s;ide eter|nity were become indifferent to him.</P>
<P>In the afternoon he de&s;ired to partake of the Lord's &s;upper; which he received with a melting, prai&s;ing, and rejoicing heart. All the re&s;t of the day he continued in the &s;ame &s;tate of &s;oul. Towards the evening he de&s;ired, that if his end &s;hould ap|proach I w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uld come to him, which I promi&s;ed; but he did not &s;end for me till next morning.</P>
<P>I was told by his valet, that he &s;lept well for &s;ome hours, and then waking, prayed for a con&s;i|derable time, continually mentioning the name of our Lord, and his mo&s;t precious blood; and that he had de&s;ired &s;everal of the officers to make his conver&s;ion known to his court, (that of the king of Poland.) After &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e I a&s;ked, Has your view of Chri&s;t, and his redemption, been nei|the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> altered nor ob&s;cured &s;ince ye&s;terday? He an|&s;wered, Neither altered nor ob&s;cured; I have no doubt&mdash;not even a remote one: it is ju&s;t the &s;ame
<PB N="21" REF="031228_0026_0FEB737BD1A41530">
with me as if I had always believed, and never doubted; &s;o gracious is the Lord Je&s;us to me a &s;inner.</P>
<P>The &s;econd day he was unwearied in prayer and exerci&s;es of faith. Towards evening he &s;ent for me in ha&s;te. When I came, I found him dying, and in a kind of delirium; &s;o I could do no more than give him now and then a word of comfort. I pray|ed afterward for him, and tho&s;e that were pre&s;ent; &s;ome of whom were of high birth and rank. I then, by impo&s;ition of hands, as u&s;ual, gave him a ble&s;&s;ing; which being done, he expired immedi|ately.</P>
<P>A royal prince who was there (prince Xavier of Saxony) could not forbear weeping; the re&s;t of the officers bewailed the death of their general, yet prai&s;ed God for having &s;hewn &s;uch mercy to him.</P>
<P>I wrote an account of it without delay to his mo|ther, and had an immediate an&s;wer. She was a lady of &s;eventy-two, of exemplary piety. She prai&s;ed God for his mercy, adding, that he had now an&s;wered her prayers, which &s;he had never cea&s;ed to offer on his behalf for eleven years.</P>

<HEAD>THE EAGLE.</HEAD>
<P>This creature is &s;o highly enriched by Nature, and &s;o maje&s;tic in appearance, that the ancients called it <HI>the bird of Heaven</HI>; but moderns have pronounced it <HI>the king of birds.</HI> According to Linnaeus, he is a &s;pecies of the &s;econd genus called Falco, belonging to the fir&s;t order accipetes, or ra|pacious. The eagle is of different &s;orts, probably only denominated from their colour, and the place of their retreat. That called the golden eagle is mo&s;t e&s;teemed, being larger and of a more noble appearance than others. His beak is very &s;trong, crooked and &s;harp; his head and neck are clothed with narrow &s;harp pointed feathers of a deep brown colour, but tho&s;e on the head, in old age, turn grey. The whole body is of a dark brown, and
<PB N="24" REF="031228_0029_0FEB7383F7FFFBB8">
the feathers of the back are beautifully clouded with a deeper &s;hade. The wings, when clothed, reach to the tail, which is of a deep brown, irregularly bar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, and blotted with an ob&s;cure a&s;h colour. Every year he moults, and becomes almo&s;t naked and bald, and then renews its youth by producing a &s;et of new feathers. His legs are yellow, &s;hort, and very &s;trong, covered with feathers of a dark grey; his toes are coated with &s;cales, and armed with the mo&s;t formidable claws. The body may weigh a dozen pounds. From the point of the bill to the tail it mea&s;ures four feet; and between the points of each wing, when extended, near &s;ix feet. He is a bird of great &s;trength, exceeding bold, and very voracious in &s;eizing its prey, which are ge|nerally gee&s;e, cranes, hares, rabbits, lambs, kids, fawns, and &s;erpents; but when impelled by hun|ger will &s;eize on much larger animals; and Sir Robert Sibbald a&s;&s;ures us, that children, when un|attended, have been devoured by them. They ge|nerally quench their thir&s;t with the blood of their prey; and, after feeding on the fle&s;h, break the bones to extract the marrow. It is, however, to be ob&s;erved, that this bird, unle&s;s pre&s;&s;ed with fa|mine, will not &s;toop to carrion, and never devours but what he has earned by his own pur&s;uits. The &s;ight of the eagle is quick, &s;trong, and piercing,
<PB N="25" REF="031228_0030_0FEB7385870BD928">
not only di&s;covering their prey at an amazing di&s;|tance, but penetrating the rays of the meridian &s;un. Angelus, the je&s;uit, informs us that the rea&s;on why the eagle, the fibres of who&s;e optic nerves are not &s;tronger than tho&s;e of other animals, is able to face the &s;un, and endure its rays, is, that it has two &s;ets of eye-lids; the one thick and clo&s;e, and the other thiner and finer, which la&s;t it draws over the eyes when it looks at any luminous body, and thus breaks the force of its rays. Of all birds the eagle flies the highe&s;t, even to a proverb. Prov. xxiii.5. It frequents the highe&s;t mountains, and the mo&s;t in|acce&s;&s;ible clifts of the rock; there they generally make their ne&s;t, depo&s;it their eggs, which are &s;el|dom more than two. They fo&s;ter their young with peculiar affection and care. In a time of fa|mine they are &s;aid to feed their young with their own blood, &s;ooner than &s;uffer them to peri&s;h. When danger &s;urrounds them, the eagle flutters over the ne&s;t to defend the brood from their enemies, or takes them on its wings and bears them away to a more &s;afe retreat. But this bird is mo&s;t remark|able for its longevity, and its faculty for &s;u&s;taining a long ab&s;tinence from food. Key&s;ler relates, that an eagle died at Vienna, after a confinement of an hundred and four years.</P>

<P>Thou great Supreme! who hath created every winged fowl after its kind, that they might fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven, at thy command the eagle mounts and maketh her ne&s;t on high; &s;he dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the &s;trong place; from thence &s;he &s;eeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar off; her young ones al&s;o &s;uck her blood, and where the &s;lain are there is &s;he. Gen. i.20, 21. Job xxxix.27&mdash;30. While the bea&s;t of the field, and fowls of the air, prai&s;e the name of their adored Creator, may I ever em|ploy my breath in prai&s;ing the name of the Lord, for his name alone is excellent, and his glory is above the earth and heaven!</P>
<P>The eagle, with its wings extended, was reli|giou&s;ly con&s;ecrated by the Per&s;ians, and afterwards by the Romans, who, in the &s;econd year of the con&s;ulate of C. Marius, was fixed upon as the device on their &s;tandard, made in relievo of &s;ilver or gold, borne on the tops of pikes. This bird, according to the opinion of Martinius, was &s;elect|ed as a deity from the derivation of the <HI>Greek</HI> name <GAP DESC="foreign">, from <GAP DESC="foreign">, to breath (from which verb &s;ays
<PB N="27" REF="031228_0032_0FEB738DD4826590">

<P>The mo&s;t high adorable Jehovah, who hath provided a full, free, and an everla&s;ting &s;alvation for his guilty people, hath graciou&s;ly conde&s;cended to reveal him&s;elf and his mercy in every age, by images and emblems, that by objects of &s;en&s;e our faith in him might be e&s;tabli&s;hed. The Ark and Cherubims, with their apparatus, ordained by God, fir&s;t for the Tabernacle of Mo&s;es, then for the Temple of Solomon, were an exhibition of what had been tran&s;acted in heaven, and was yet to be completed for man. The mercy-&s;eat, to be &s;prin|kled with atoning blood, was made of pure gold; and of the &s;ame piece was beaten out two figures, each po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing four faces, bearing the likene&s;s of an ox, a lion, an eagle, and a man, called the Cherubims of Glory; each of them had wings ex|tended, embracing each other; and between the&s;e Jehovah dwelt, and, by the office of the High Prie&s;t, communicated his will, and ble&s;&s;ed the tribes of I&s;rael.

Into the&s;e names, as the portion of the church, all who believe, whether Jew or Gentile, under the go&s;pel, are bapti&s;ed. Matt. xxviii.19.</P>
<P>But, perhaps, as the mercy-&s;eat of pure gold, &s;prinkled with blood, was a type of Chri&s;t, whom God hath &s;et forth a propitiation for &s;in; and as the cherubs were made out of the very &s;ame ma&s;s of gold with the mercy-&s;eat, they may not impro|perly be con&s;idered repre&s;entatives of the per&s;onal glories of the &s;ame Immanuel. The extraordinary eye of the eagle, capable of penetrating the rays of the &s;un, and to di&s;cover its object at &s;o remote a di&s;tance, and his power by flight to a&s;cend up on high, are no inexpre&s;&s;ible emblems of the omni&s;ci|ence and omnipre&s;ence peculiar to the Son of God.

<P>MY &s;on, although I have often given you my advice, while pa&s;&s;ing through your child|hood; as you have now entered your &s;ixteenth year, you need more circum&s;pection than youth of your age generally imagine.

<P>The period at which you have now ar|rived, mo&s;t certainly demands your devout acknow|ledgment to the Author of your being. How often has your life been recovered from tho&s;e di&s;orders incident to infancy and childhood! How greatly have you been di&s;tingui&s;hed from thou&s;ands who, in their early age, have been de&s;titute of the means of education! How bountiful has the Almighty been in the be&s;towment of mental accompli&s;hments upon you, and from which, as your parent, I an|ticipate your future u&s;efulne&s;s in the world! yet, my child, tho&s;e who have arrived at the meridian of life know that your &s;tage is the mo&s;t critical, important, and dangerous. The latent evils of your heart will now begin to i&s;&s;ue forth as bitter waters from a corrupted &s;pring: the world will unfold to you her delu&s;ive charms, and ten thou&s;and objects will advance to tempt your feet from the path of honor.&mdash;Wipe away that tear which &s;tands trem|bling in your eye; be a&s;&s;ured, my &s;on, had I rea|&s;on to believe you would thus depart from virtue, I &s;hould be the mo&s;t wretched of fathers. Though hitherto free from tho&s;e vices to which, alas! too many have been addicted, your brea&s;t, like all the &s;ons of men, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es tho&s;e &s;eeds of vice which only

<P>I am glad you begin to feel your&s;elf&mdash; this is one &s;tep towards a cure. You know I have ever taught you to re&s;pect the Bible, becau&s;e I have &s;ufficient evidence to believe it is the mind of God to man. Take that book, my &s;on, with a de&s;ign to trace the &s;ource, the nature, and the con|&s;equences of that evil your heart &s;o bitterly laments. That the&s;e pages exhibit to me my true likene&s;s, as a &s;inner, is an evidence of their divine original, which my unbelieving heart, nor all the powers of infidelity, can de&s;troy.

<P>A Society of gentlemen, mo&s;t of them po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a liberal education and poli&s;hed manners, but who, unhappily, had been &s;educed from a belief of the &s;criptures, u&s;ed to a&s;&s;emble alternately in each other's hou&s;es, on the bank of the Tweed, for the purpo&s;e of ridiculing Revelation, and harden|ing each other in their infidelity.

The day fixed upon came&mdash;a large fire was prepared&mdash;a Bible was laid upon the table, and a flowing bowl &s;tood ready to drink its dirge. For the execution of their plan, they fixed upon a young gentleman of high birth, brilliant vivacity, and elegance of manners. He undertook the ta&s;k, and, after a few enliven|ing gla&s;&s;es, amid&s;t the applau&s;es of his jovial com|panions, he approached the table, took up the Bible, and was walking re&s;olutely forward to put it in the fire; but, happening to give it a look, all at once he was &s;eized with trembling; palene&s;s over|&s;pread his countenance, and his whole frame &s;eem|ed convul&s;ed.

<HEAD>OBITUARY.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 26th of September, 1795, died, in the 32d year of his age, of the malignant fever which then prevailed in New-York, the Rev. JACOB BRUSH, one of the Elders of the Methodi&s;t Epi&s;|copal Church. Mr. Bru&s;h attended Mr. Court|ney, at who&s;e hou&s;e he boarded, and who died of the fever; and on the next Lord's-day he preached a &s;ermon on the occa&s;ion, from Matt. xxv.23. in the new church. Mr. Bru&s;h, immediately on his return home, was taken ill, langui&s;hed five days and died, and on the Sabbath following the Rev. Mr. King&s;ton preached a &s;ermon, from Rev. xiv.13. in the &s;ame pulpit, on the death of Mr. Bru&s;h.
<PB N="47" REF="031228_0052_0FEB73CD836648F8">
Shall not this event make a &s;olemn impre&s;&s;ion upon &s;urviving Mini&s;ters, that they may &s;o faithfully di&s;|charge their office as to be ready to go from the pulpit to the tribunal of Jehovah? What is yet remarkable, Mr. Bru&s;h, in a few days, was to have been married to Mi&s;s E. M.&mdash;How &s;oon may our mo&s;t plea&s;ing pro&s;pects be over-ca&s;t, and we torn from the embraces of our friends, and lodged in the chambers of corruption!</P>
<P>Mr. Bru&s;h, at an early period of life, became &s;eriou&s;ly affected with divine things. After deep di&s;tre&s;s for &s;in, he obtained faith in Chri&s;t as his Saviour. He then thought it his duty to preach the Go&s;pel of that Chri&s;t who had done &s;o much for his &s;oul, and in 1785 he was admitted as proba|tioner into the Conferrence of Methodi&s;t Mini&s;|ters. In 1788 he was ordained a <HI>Deacon,</HI> and in 1790 he entered the <HI>Elder&s;hip.</HI> As a mini&s;ter, he was zealous, wi&s;e, bold and &s;ucce&s;sful; as a chri&s;|tian, devout and circum&s;pect; and as a friend, &s;ympathetic, kind and con&s;tant. In his la&s;t &s;ick|ne&s;s he appeared &s;olemnly happy; and, a few hours before his death, he was a&s;ked "Whether he felt happy in God, and had an a&s;&s;urance of the divine favour?" To which (by &s;igns) he an&s;wered in the affirmative. The la&s;t Lord's-day that he preached he appeared to be &s;o re&s;igned to the will

of God, that &s;ome of the hearers ob&s;erved, "they never heard him preach with &s;o much power before, and that he &s;eemed to preach as though it were his la&s;t."</P>
<P>Thus was cut off, in the prime of life, a pro|mi&s;ing and u&s;eful Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, and as highly beloved among the people of his connection.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>JUSTIFICATION is one of the mo&s;t import|ant articles of our holy religion, and demands our mo&s;t &s;olemn attention. Brevity and per&s;picuity be|ing our aim in preparing this paper, we &s;hall&mdash;ex|plain
<PB N="50" REF="031228_0055_0FEB73D6F1671C28">
the <HI>term</HI>&mdash;con&s;ider the <HI>author</HI>&mdash;the <HI>objects</HI> intere&s;ted&mdash;the <HI>ble&s;&s;ings</HI> re&s;ulting.</P>
<P>We are, I. To explain the term. Ju&s;tification, &s;piritually or evangelically con&s;idered, is a complete acquittal from imputed and contracted guilt; a de|liverance from the condemning power of &s;in; an act of free grace flowing from Jehovah's &s;overeign good will and plea&s;ure. By many eminent divines this leading doctrine is con&s;idered as twofold &mdash; ETERNAL and DECLARATIVE. By the <HI>former,</HI> we under&s;tand that which exi&s;ted in the divine mind from everla&s;ting, re&s;pecting the cho&s;en &s;eed, united with Chri&s;t their head, "who hath &s;aved us, ac|cording to his own purpo&s;e and grace, which was given us in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, before the world began." 2 Tim. i.9. By the <HI>latter,</HI> viz. declarative ju&s;ti|fication, is de&s;igned <HI>that</HI> which, in time, takes place in or on the con&s;cience of a believer, commonly &s;tiled <HI>ju&s;tification by or through faith.</HI> It is upon <HI>this</HI> we now addre&s;s you. To be <HI>thus</HI> fully ab&s;olved from all &s;in and guilt, by virtue of Chri&s;t's plenary &s;atisfaction, and pronounced "heirs of eternal life," oh, how enlivening the thought! how animating the reflection! "Ble&s;s the Lord, O our &s;ouls, and all that is within us, ble&s;s his holy name."</P>
<P>We come, II. to con&s;ider the author of our ju&s;ti|fication. "It is God who ju&s;tifieth." Rom. viii.33.
<PB N="51" REF="031228_0056_0FEB73DA5A3D9338">
A Triune God, Father, Son and Holy Gho&s;t. A truth this, when viewed in all its parts, calculated to excite not only within <HI>us,</HI> but amid the angelic choir the highe&s;t wonder, "which things the angels de&s;ire to look into." 1 Pet. i.12. "Whom GOD hath &s;et forth to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to declare his righteou&s;ne&s;s for the remi&s;|&s;ion of &s;ins that are pa&s;t, through the Forbearance of God; to declare, I &s;ay, at this time his righteou&s;|ne&s;s; that <HI>he</HI> might be ju&s;t, and the ju&s;tifier of him who believeth in Je&s;us. Rom. x.25, 26. "Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgive|ne&s;s of &s;ins; and by HIM all that believe are ju&s;tified from all things, from which ye could not be ju&s;tified by the law of Mo&s;es." Acts xiii.38, 39. "And &s;uch were &s;ome of you; but ye are wa&s;hed, but ye are &s;anctified, but ye are ju&s;tified, in the name of the Lord Je&s;us, and by the SPIRIT of our God." 1 Cor. vi.11. Many other pertinent texts might be quo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+ed; but permit us, previous to our di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of this head, to mention, with all due conci&s;ene&s;s, a few of the cau&s;es of our being thus <HI>ju&s;tified</HI> or pronounced RIGHTEOUS. "The works of the Lord are great, &s;ought out of all them who have plea&s;ure <HI>therein,</HI>" is of equal force now as when penned by I&s;rael's king. Thus &s;upported, we will not be backward in a&s;&s;erting&mdash;</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="52" REF="031228_0057_0FEB73DC0327B570">1&s;t. That <HI>from</HI> this main pillar, this Sublime Characteri&s;tic of go&s;pel truth, <HI>man's obedience to a law of works</HI> is to be utterly excluded. Paul peremptorily &s;ays, "By the deeds of the law no fle&s;h &s;hall be ju&s;tified in his &s;ight." Rom. iii.20. This <HI>&s;ingle</HI> declaration, confirmed by repeated equal te&s;|timony, condemns at once every idea of ju&s;tification by virtue of our own doings. Tho&s;e who harbour a &s;entiment &s;o oppo&s;ed to Jehovah's revealed will, vainly imagine, con&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves, to bring the &s;upreme governor of univer&s;al nature under obligation to do <HI>them</HI> good. But, beloved, <HI>we</HI> have not &s;o learned Chri&s;t, <HI>we</HI> do not wi&s;h to rob the ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer of the brighte&s;t jewel in his me|diatorial crown, <HI>we</HI> do not intend thus ba&s;ely to detract from that glory which peculiarly belongs to the &s;acred <HI>Three-One.</HI> "For there is not a ju&s;t man upon earth who doeth good and &s;inneth not." Ecc. vii.20. "But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteou&s;ne&s;&s;es are as filthy rags." I&s;a. lxiv.6.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. What is by too many denominated <HI>com|pliance with go&s;pel terms,</HI> we do not admit as hav|ing any claim. The go&s;pel of our &s;alvation is un|conditional; it knows no <HI>terms</HI> on our part as lead|ing to a ju&s;tifying righteou&s;ne&s;s. <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>repent|ance</HI> are graces be&s;towed by the Spirit of God; they are ble&s;&s;ings flowing from that covenant which
<PB N="53" REF="031228_0058_0FEB73E261DEAF50">
is ordered in all things, and &s;ure. In fine, regene|ration of &s;oul, &s;anctification of heart, &s;incerity of di&s;po&s;ition, holine&s;s of life, per&s;evering fidelity, un|deviating acquie&s;cence in Jehovah's government, &s;teady zeal for Immanuel's intere&s;t, all our own pious frames of mind, comfortable feelings and ap|proving te&s;timonies of con&s;cience are, with re&s;pect to this all-e&s;&s;ential doctrine, to be kept <HI>totally</HI> out of view. To what, then, is our ju&s;tification to be a&s;cribed?</P>
<P>We reply, 1&s;t. To the mere grace or favour of God as the <HI>moving</HI> cau&s;e, "being ju&s;tified freely by his grace." Rom. iii.24. "But after that the kindne&s;s and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared; not by works of righteou&s;ne&s;s, which we have done, but according to his mercy he &s;aved us." Titus iii.4, 5. <HI>That,</HI> which never could have been found out by men or angels, the wi&s;dom of Jehovah contrived, and his love hath made known. <HI>This</HI> is the original &s;ource. Here is the fountain from whence all &s;prings.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. To the life and pa&s;&s;ion of Je&s;us as the <HI>pro|curing</HI> cau&s;e. "But God commendeth his love to|wards us, in that while we were yet &s;inners, Chri&s;t died for us. Much more then being now <HI>ju&s;tified by his blood,</HI> we &s;hall be &s;aved from wrath through him." Rom. v.8, 9. He fulfilled every precept,
<PB REF="031228_0059_0FEB73E3EDA64F50">
he bore the whole penalty of the law in the room and &s;tead of his people: thus was the law magnified and rendered honourable, an end made of &s;in and everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s brought in; "and this is his name whereby he &s;hall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS." Jeremiah xxiii.6. Oh glorious name! predicted long before his in|carnation&mdash;Unto whom &s;hould we go but unto our once bleeding but now ri&s;en Saviour for acceptance? &mdash;For us he drank the bitter cup&mdash;Let us not &s;ub&s;titute any thing in the place of his noble &s;acri|fice&mdash;It is <HI>now</HI> a righteous thing with God, freely to <HI>ju&s;tify</HI> and abundantly to <HI>pardon.</HI> "In the LORD &s;hall all the &s;eed of I&s;rael be ju&s;tified, and &s;hall glory." I&s;aiah xlv.25. The robe of Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s is a garment down to the foot, where|with every member of the my&s;tical body is amply covered; "for he hath made him to be &s;in for us, who knew no &s;in; that we might be made the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God, in him." 2 Cor. v.21. "Such an high prie&s;t became us who is holy, harmle&s;s, undefiled and &s;eparate from &s;inners." Heb. vii.26. Should any put the que&s;tion&mdash;How doth Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s, thus con&s;i&s;ting of the holi|ne&s;s of his nature, his active and pa&s;&s;ive obedience, become our's in &s;uch wi&s;e that we al&s;o are nece&s;|&s;arily deemed RIGHTEOUS?</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="031228_0060_0FEB73E5CCF542C0">We readily an&s;wer&mdash;By IMPUTATION; by making it over unto us; reckoning it our's, or placing it to our account, being wrought out by our elder brother on behalf of the whole ran&s;om|ed flock. "David de&s;cribeth the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of the man, unto whom God <HI>imputeth</HI> righteou&s;ne&s;s with|out "works." Rom. iv.6.&mdash;Pur&s;uant, therefore, to the unalterable purpo&s;e of heaven, agreeable to the oeconomy of man's redemption, this righteou&s;|ne&s;s of the precious Je&s;us, whereof &s;o many glo|rious things are &s;poken, is as much our's as though wrought out by our&s;elves in our own proper per|&s;ons. Rom. v.18, 19. Phil. iii.8, 9. Thus clothed upon with raiment of needle-work&mdash;Thus united with the HEAD, how can the members be viewed by God the judge of all but as perfectly and com|pletely ju&s;tified? "And ye are complete in him, who is the head of all principality and power." Col. ii.10.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Our ju&s;tification is by &s;ome a&s;cribed to <HI>faith</HI> as an <HI>in&s;trumental</HI> cau&s;e. Strictly &s;peaking, we apprehend <HI>&s;aith</HI> as no cau&s;e at all in this mo|mentuous procedure, but rather as an effect. It is true, the &s;criptures frequently mention a <HI>ju&s;tifi|cation by faith</HI>&mdash;By &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions it is evident the <HI>object,</HI> and not the <HI>act</HI> of faith, is de&s;igned: the object of faith is Chri&s;t and his righteou&s;ne&s;s: this
<PB N="56" REF="031228_0061_0FEB73E8F3C860D0">
the believing &s;oul holds fa&s;t. Faith is the eye which di&s;covers, the hand which receives; e&s;pying a Sa|viour's worth, charmed with his merit, the believer is &s;o enraptured as to ca&s;t away all his heavy burden, falls at Me&s;&s;iah's feet, confides in the promi&s;e, and pleads atoning blood, "with the heart man believeth unto righteou&s;ne&s;s." Rom. x.10. It is beautifully ob&s;erved by one of our very fir&s;t and mo&s;t orthodox writers: "The rea&s;on why any are ju&s;tified is not becau&s;e they have faith&mdash;But the rea&s;on why they have faith is becau&s;e they are ju&s;tified." If ju&s;tified by faith as a work performed by us, or as a grace wrought without us, where would have been the nece&s;&s;ity of the death and re&s;urrection of Je&s;us? Faith is that precious grace by which we do, in a certain manner, put on the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Lord's anointed, and receive the greate&s;t of all ble&s;|&s;ings from the God of our &s;alvation. "It is a grace (&s;aith one) which quarrels much with human pride, and makes its only boa&s;t of Sharon's ro&s;e; and ne|ver was meant to be our ju&s;tifying righteou&s;ne&s;s in the &s;ight of God, el&s;e it would learn to <HI>boa&s;t</HI>&mdash; Faith &s;ays, 'In the Lord have I righteou&s;ne&s;s,' and tells a &s;inner, 'I cannot &s;ave thee,' thou art &s;aved by grace <HI>through</HI> faith." The grace of Je&s;us, and that alone, brings &s;alvation; and the &s;inner, <HI>through faith,</HI> as an in&s;trument put in his hand, is enabled
<PB N="57" REF="031228_0062_0FEB73EF58462450">
to reach the rich donation; ju&s;t as a begger, by his <HI>empty</HI> cap &s;tretched forth, receives an alms. We proceed,</P>
<P N="3">III. To de&s;cribe the objects intere&s;ted. In the Examination of this particular, what abundant rea|&s;on have we to adopt the prophetic language, "to the law and to the te&s;timony? If they &s;peak not ac|cording to this word, it is becau&s;e there is no light in them." I&s;aiah viii.20. The per&s;ons ju&s;tified through rich and &s;overeign grace are in the living oracles declared to be "ungodly," Rom. iv.5. al&s;o "&s;inners." Gal. ii.17. Was it not for declara|tions like the&s;e, where would be our comfort? We are all <HI>&s;inners,</HI> we are all <HI>ungodly</HI>; does it from hence follow, that <HI>all</HI> who are &s;inners, <HI>all</HI> who are ungodly, are without exception ju&s;tified? By no means! the whole canon of &s;cripture combine with the dictates of &s;ound experience to render every &s;uch idea inadmi&s;&s;ible. It is true, we read, "that by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of one, the free gift came upon all men unto ju&s;tification of life." Rom. v.18. By a careful revi&s;ion of what goes before and follows after, we &s;hall find the apo&s;tle did not mean <HI>all men</HI> ab&s;olutely, but <HI>all the cho&s;en, all believers</HI>; his epi&s;tle was directed to "all that be in Rome, be|loved of God, called to be &s;aints." Moreover, the <HI>ju&s;tified</HI> are repre&s;ented as a <HI>peculiar</HI> people, and
<PB N="58" REF="031228_0063_0FEB73F0E361D0C8">
have &s;uch characters a&s;cribed to them as cannot, without the greate&s;t incon&s;i&s;tency and abu&s;e of lan|guage, be a&s;cribed to all the progeny of fallen Adam. They are &s;poken of as tho&s;e who are prede&s;tinated, redeemed, pardoned, effectually called, &s;anctified, regenerated, &amp;c. That the&s;e things are not <HI>true,</HI> with re&s;pect to <HI>all</HI> the lap&s;ed family, every <HI>unpreju|diced</HI> mind mu&s;t acknowledge. Upon the whole, tho&s;e who are <HI>unworthy</HI> and <HI>guilty</HI> in them&s;elves, but in the everla&s;ting covenant <HI>elected</HI> and <HI>beloved,</HI> have that righteou&s;ne&s;s whereon their ju&s;tification is founded, not only exhibited to them by the go&s;|pel, but brought nigh by the Holy Gho&s;t, the&s;e are the "purcha&s;ed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion," this is the "bride," the lamb's wife; between whom and the Lord Je|&s;es, an union not only now exi&s;ts, but hath exi&s;t|ed, ancient as eternity it&s;elf, "I have loved thee with an everla&s;ting love: therefore, with loving kindne&s;s have I drawn thee," Jer. xxxi.3. a mul|titude which no man can number. The</P>
<P N="4">IV. And la&s;t thing propo&s;ed for inve&s;tigation, is the ble&s;&s;ings re&s;ulting from ju&s;tification.</P>
<P>Where &s;hall we begin, and how &s;hall we end? ble&s;&s;ings great indeed croud in upon us! ble&s;&s;ings beyond compare are con&s;equential on our being thus freely ju&s;tified! a doctrine pregnant with com|fort inexpre&s;&s;ible! a foundation is hereby laid not
<PB N="59" REF="031228_0064_0FEB73F2B7485BE8">
&s;imply for fluctuating hope, but for the full a&s;&s;ur|ance of pre&s;ent and future bli&s;s. By virtue hereof, we experience&mdash;1. A freedom or deliverance from &s;in and condemnation. From <HI>all</HI> &s;in, as to its guilt, from its reigning power and dominion, and by and by from its in-being "the blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t his &s;on, clean&s;eth us from all &s;in." 1 John i.7. Heb. x.12&mdash;14. Our &s;ins are covered and hid from the all-penetrating eye of divine ju&s;tice, and when &s;ought for hereafter &s;hall not be found; "there is, therefore, now no condemnation to them who are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us." Rom. viii.1. Gal. iii.13. When &s;eriou&s;ly reflecting on our happy re&s;cue from the hands of &s;atan, our accu&s;ing foe; al&s;o from death and the grave, as penal evils; but more e&s;pecially from the pains of hell and the wrath to come; and all as the effect of love divine, what heart among us can remain cold and lifele&s;s? what tongue can cea&s;e to prai&s;e?&mdash;2. As ju&s;tified we enjoy peace with God. "Therefore, being ju&s;tified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t." Rom. v.1. Connected herewith is real peace of mind. Oh happy &s;ouls! brought fully to behold a crucified Redeemer making peace by the blood of his cro&s;s, "the cha&s;ti&s;ement of our peace was upon him." I&s;aiah liii.5.

<HEAD>The Life of the late Reverend and learned <HI>AU|GUSTUS MONTAGUE TOPLADY,</HI> M. A. Vicar of Broad Hembury, in Devon&s;hire, Great-Britain.</HEAD>
<P>THIS eminent &s;ervant of Chri&s;t was born at Farnham, in Surrey, Nov. 4, 1740. His father, Richard Toplady, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> a captain in the army, died at the &s;iege of <HI>Carthagena</HI> &s;oon after the birth of his &s;on. Augu&s;tus received the fir&s;t part of his education at We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;chool; but it becoming nece&s;&s;ary for his mother to make a journey to Ire|land, to pur&s;ue &s;ome claims to an e&s;tate in that king|dom, he accompanied her thither, and was entered at <HI>Trinity College</HI> in Dublin, where he took his degree of <HI>Bachelor in arts.</HI> In Augu&s;t. 1756, being in his 16th year, the Lord vi&s;ited his &s;oul with &s;alvation under the mini&s;try of Mr. Morris, while preaching from Eph. ii.13. "Strange, &s;ays Mr. Toplady, that I, who had &s;o long &s;at under the means of grace in England, &s;hould be brought nigh to God, in an ob&s;cure part of Ireland, amid&s;t an handful of God's people met together in a barn and under the mini&s;try of one who could hardly &s;pell his own name! Surely, it was the Lord's doing, and is marvellous! The excellency of &s;uch power
<PB N="68" REF="031228_0073_0FEB740FA633B190">
mu&s;t be of God, and cannot be of man. The re|generating &s;pirit breathes not only <HI>on whom,</HI> but likewi&s;e <HI>when, where,</HI> and <HI>as</HI> HE li&s;teth."</P>
<P>Mr. Toplady enjoying the comforts of religion in his &s;oul, God gave him a mo&s;t ardent de&s;ire for the mini&s;try of the go&s;pel; and, as he abhorred the Popi&s;h tenet, that "Ignorance was the mother of devotion," &s;o his wi&s;h, as well as his duty, was, to be <HI>thoroughly furni&s;hed</HI>; and to avoid the pre&s;ump|tion of teaching the <HI>ignorant and tho&s;e that are out of the way,</HI> without having the knowledge, as well as the grace, indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary for that purpo&s;e, he pur&s;ued his &s;tudies with redoubled ar|dour, and directed them entirely for the honour of his Lord and the good of men. On June the 6th, 1762, Mr. Toplady received <HI>epi&s;copal ordination,</HI> and &s;ome time after was inducted to the living of <HI>Broad Hembury,</HI> where he laboured in the go&s;pel with &s;ucce&s;s, and compo&s;ed mo&s;t of tho&s;e writings which will render &s;ervice to the church, and do ho|nour to his memory, while truth and learning &s;hall be e&s;teemed valuable among men. He had no pre|ferment in the church be&s;ides the vicarage of Broad Hembury, which, as his mind could never brook the idea of living ill with his pari&s;h on account of tythes, did not amount to 80l. a year. His own account of his engaging in the pa&s;toral office, in his <HI>Hi&s;torie

"I ble&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> God," &s;ays he, "for enabling me to e&s;teem the re|proach of Chri&s;t greater trea&s;ure than all the ap|plau&s;e of men, and all the preferments of the church. When I received Orders, <HI>I obtained mercy to be faithful,</HI> and from that moment gave up what is called the <HI>world,</HI> &s;o far as I conceived it to interfere with faith and a good con&s;cience.&mdash;I can never be &s;ufficiently thankful, that my religious principles were all fixed long before I entered into orders. Through the good hand of my God upon me, I &s;at out in the mini&s;try with clear go&s;pel-light from the fir&s;t; a ble&s;&s;ing not vouch&s;afed to every one. Many an evangelical mini&s;ter has found him&s;elf obliged to retract, and un&s;ay what he had taught before in the days of his ignorance. Lord, how is it that I have been &s;o &s;ignally favoured of Thee! O keep me to the end &s;tedfa&s;t in thy truth! Let me but go on <HI>ex|perimentally</HI> to know Thee, and then it will be ab|&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible for me to depart from the precious doctrines of grace; my early in&s;ight into which I look upon as one of the di&s;tingui&s;hed ble&s;&s;ings of my life."&mdash;"For my own part," &s;ays he in a letter to a friend, "I wi&s;h to live and die with the &s;word of the &s;pirit in my hand, and, as Dr. Young expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>never to put off my armour till I put on my &s;hroud.</HI>"&mdash;Nor did he fail of his wi&s;h; he had, as it

<P>In September, 1773, on the introduction of the Rev. John Ryland, &s;en. of Northampton, Great-Britain, the college in <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> conferred on Mr. Toplady the degree of MASTER IN THE ARTS. In 1775, finding his bodily con&s;titution much impaired by the moi&s;t atmo&s;phere of Devon|&s;hire, with which it never agreed, he removed to London. Here, by the &s;olicitation of his numer|ous friends, and from a de&s;ire to promote the wel|fare of Zion, he engaged the chapel belonging to the French Reformed, near Leice&s;ter Fields, where he continued in the exerci&s;e of his mini&s;try as fre|quent as his health permitted, God crowning his la|bours with the mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;ucce&s;s. By a &s;low con&s;umption he, however, gradually drew to the period of his life. As his outward man wa&s;ted, his inward man was refre&s;hed and renewed, day by day. Still, while life and breath remained, he mu&s;t be either preaching or writing, to vindicate the honour of his Ma&s;ter, and propagate the glory of evangelic truth, for the comfort of the &s;ouls of men. To a friend, who expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome concern for his own ea&s;e in his debilitated &s;tate, on his clo&s;e
<PB N="71" REF="031228_0076_0FEB741928E82330">
applications, he thus replied, "God give us to &s;ink deeper and deeper into his love, and to rai&s;e higher and higher into the image of his holine&s;s! and thoroughly per&s;uaded I am, that the more we are enabled to love and re&s;emble Him, the more active we &s;hall be to promote his glory, and to extend his cau&s;e with our lips, our pens, our lives, our all. Be this our bu&s;ine&s;s, and our bli&s;s, on earth! In heaven we &s;hall have nothing to do, but to <HI>&s;ee him as he is,</HI> to participate his glory, and to &s;ing his prai&s;e, in delightful, in never-ending concert with angels, with &s;aints who are got home before us, and with tho&s;e of the elect, whom we knew and loved here below." The nearer he drew to the grave, the more abundantly did the con&s;olation of God abound in him. He looked not only with compo&s;ure, but delight on the tomb, and groaned earne&s;tly to enter the man&s;ions of the ble&s;&s;ed. Dr. Young's beautiful expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>one eye on death, and one full fixed on heaven,</HI>" was never more evident than in Mr. Toplady. While on his dying bed, he di&s;covered a remarkable jealou&s;y, for fear of receiving any part of that honour which is due to Chri&s;t alone. He de&s;ired to be nothing, and that Je&s;us might be all, and in all.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding Mr. Toplady was so highly fa|voured with the &s;miles of the Saviour, he had a
<PB N="72" REF="031228_0077_0FEB741C555F7F20">
proportionate &s;en&s;ibility of his wretchedne&s;s as a &s;inner. "Oh!" &s;aid he, "that ever &s;uch a wretch as I &s;hould be tempted to think highly of him&s;elf! I that am, of my&s;elf, nothing but &s;in and weak|ne&s;s; I, in who&s;e fle&s;h naturally dwells no good thing; I who de&s;erve damnation for the be&s;t work I ever performed! Lord Je&s;us, humble me to the du&s;t, yea, to the very center of aba&s;ement, in <HI>thy</HI> pre&s;ence.

</FIGURE> THE ELEPHANT.</HEAD>
<P>THE elephant is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the <HI>large&s;t</HI> of any quadruped in the known world; and &s;eems to be the <HI>wi&s;e&s;t</HI> al&s;o. The ob&s;ervation is Cicero's: who&s;e words (<HI>De Nat. Deor.</HI> i.) are, "Ele|phanto belluarum nualla providentior. At figur&acirc; quae va&s;tior?" All the <HI>amiable,</HI> and all the <HI>furious</HI> pa&s;&s;ions, are to be found in this animal: and its <HI>docility</HI> is wonderful; for, when properly tamed, he is capable of being in&s;tructed and di&s;ciplined into a va&s;t variety of entertaining and u&s;eful qualifica|tions.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="031228_0079_0FEB7424343714A8">Do him a material injury, and he'll act as if he had been tutor'd by the late Lord Che&s;terfield; i. e. if it be in his power, he will <HI>immediately</HI> revenge the affront; but it re&s;trained for the pre&s;ent, either by motives of prudence, or by inability to wreak his re&s;entment, he will <HI>retain</HI> the offence in his memory for years together, and take care to repay it with intere&s;t, the fir&s;t favourable opportunity. I have heard or read of a boy, who wantonly &s;truck the probo&s;cis, or trunk, of an elephant; and then courageou&s;ly &s;ecured him&s;elf by running away. Seven years afterwards, the lad was playing near the &s;ide of a river; and had, probably, forgot his pa&s;t mi&s;demeanor. But the elephant had a better memory; and, making up to the young delinquent, gra&s;ped him with his trunk, and very &s;edately car|ried the &s;prawling captive to the water; where he ducked him once or twice over head and ears, and then quietly &s;etting him down again on terra firma, permitted him to walk off without further hurt.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that in tho&s;e countries where elephants abound, &s;uch of them as are tame, go about the &s;treets, like any other dome&s;tic animal; and, it is common for people to give them fruit as they pa&s;s. In time they commence ab&s;olute <HI>beggars,</HI> and will put in the extremity of their trunks at doors and windows, in hope of receiving the little benevo|lences
<PB N="75" REF="031228_0080_0FEB74275B18C098">
which cu&s;tom has inured them to expect. After waiting a &s;hort while, if nothing is given them, they withdraw their trunks, and pa&s;s on to the next acce&s;&s;ible hou&s;e. It is related, that &s;ome taylors were at work, on a board, within&s;ide of a window who&s;e ca&s;ement &s;tood open. A pa&s;&s;ing elephant &s;topt, and put in his trunk. One of the men, in&s;tead of conferring a douceur, gave the animal's trunk a <HI>&s;cratch</HI> with his needle. The injur'd party took no pre&s;ent notice of the provoca|tion, but patiently walked away. He repaired to a neighbouring &s;tream; and, having filled his ca|pacious trunk with a large quantity of water, re|turned to the window, where he coolly avenged him&s;elf, by &s;pouting the fluid artillery on the ag|gre&s;&s;or and his comrades, for their late breach of ho&s;pitality.&mdash;If we do not <HI>relieve</HI> the indigent, they at lea&s;t have a right not to be <HI>in&s;ulted.</HI> And, very frequently, the meane&s;t are able, &s;ooner or later, to <HI>retaliate,</HI> with u&s;ury, the contempt they unde&s;ervedly receive.</P>
<P>Every beggar is not <HI>hone&s;t.</HI> Nor are all ele|phants actuated by a &s;trict &s;en&s;e of moral delicacy. Their &s;mell is very acute: and if a per&s;on has any fruit or cakes about him, they &s;hew, by the quick and judicious application of their trunks to the proper part of his dre&s;s, that they are adepts in

<P>Elephants, like men, have (if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion) their <HI>virtues</HI> and their <HI>vices:</HI> though, to the honour of the former be it ob&s;erved, the vices of an elephant bear but &s;mall proportion to his virtues.

But their &s;ub&s;equent <HI>remor&s;e</HI> has been &s;o in&s;upportably keen, that they have refu&s;ed to take any &s;u&s;tenance, and literally &s;tarved them&s;elves to death. A le&s;&s;on to per&s;ons of <HI>violent pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> who, if hurried away by the impetuous torrent, either of exce&s;&s;ive and unguarded <HI>anger,</HI> or of head-&s;trong and irregular <HI>de&s;ire,</HI> are liable to the commi&s;&s;ion of irreparable evil, and may, in a &s;ingle moment, lay the foun|da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion of irremediable ruin. <HI>He that</HI> HASTETH <HI>with his feet, &s;inneth.</HI> O believer, if thou art by nature <HI>ha&s;ty, vehement,</HI> and ea&s;ily <HI>inflamma|ble,</HI> call in &s;uperior aid.

by the kindlings of inward wrath, would never utter a &s;ingle word, till he had fir&s;t delibe|rately run over in his mind all the letters of the al|phabet. I have read of a Chri&s;tian, who, when endangered by &s;imilar temptation, would not &s;uffer him&s;elf to &s;peak a &s;yllable, till he had &s;ilently re|peated the Lord's Prayer. Go, and do thou like|wi&s;e. Repeat that prayer to God, in the &s;pirit of &s;upplication: and thy victory over pa&s;&s;ion will be more than probable.</P>
<P>Elephants are &s;ingularly <HI>grateful,</HI> and have a very deep &s;en&s;e of <HI>friend&s;hip.</HI> They have been known to lay the death of a <HI>brother elephant,</HI> or of a <HI>kind keeper,</HI> &s;o much to heart, as to pine away from that time forward. Even virtue, if &s;trained beyond a certain pitch, degenerates into a fault. Nor is it right for us to love, with <HI>too much ardour,</HI> any peri&s;hable good. Dr. Owen &s;ome|where remarks, that "&s;trong affections make &s;trong afflictions." Confine, therefore, your <HI>ab|&s;olue</HI> regards to FATHER, SON, and SPIRIT; the Three glorious Friends, who never die, and who&s;e loving-kindne&s;s is immortal as them&s;elves!</P>
<P>In &s;ome countries, we are told, <HI>elephants</HI> &s;upply the place of <HI>executioners.</HI> They are trained, at a given &s;ignal, to lay hold on the criminal with their trunks, by a &s;trong &s;uction, and either <HI>da&s;h</HI> him

violently again&s;t the ground, or <HI>to&s;s</HI> him aloft in the air, till repeated contu&s;ions put a period to his life.&mdash;Mankind are very prone to value them&s;elves on their &s;uppo&s;ed civilization; and yet, by artfully practi&s;ing on the ferocity of inferior animals, they &s;ometimes teach brutes them&s;elves to be &s;till more brutal.</P>
<P>Clum&s;ey as elephants are, they may be taught to <HI>dance,</HI> both &s;ingly and in companies; and they move, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, with &s;ingular exactne&s;s and order. They are not in&s;en&s;ible to the harmony of <HI>mu&s;ic</HI>; and, if properly inured, <HI>keep time</HI> with their feet, in a manner which di&s;covers great powers of judgment. If I rightly remember, Bi&s;hop Bur|net informs us, in his travels, that he &s;aw an ele|phant <HI>play at ball,</HI> with all the ea&s;e and expertne&s;s of a man. But PLUTARCH, in his life of Pyrrhus, mentions a much nobler in&s;tance of elephantin <HI>un|der&s;tanding</HI> and <HI>adroitne&s;s</HI>; accompanied by &s;uch magnanimous <HI>courage</HI> and <HI>fidelity,</HI> as would have redounded to the honour of a Sertorius, or of an Alexander. When Pyrrhus &s;tormed the town of Argos, a number of accoutered elephants (accord|ing to the cu&s;tom of tho&s;e times) formed a part of his military apparatus. One of the&s;e creatures, perceiving that his rider was fallen, invited him, by every effort in his power, to re-mount. But find|ing,
<PB N="79" REF="031228_0084_0FEB7432B6F36200">
&s;oon after, that he [viz. the rider] was dead of the wounds he had received, the animal, in a tran&s;port of grief and rage, ru&s;hed furiou&s;ly on friends and foes, without di&s;tinction; and, taking up the body with his trunk, made good his retreat, and re&s;cued the remains of his breathle&s;s ma&s;ter from further violation, by faithfully and heroically conveying them from the &s;cene of action.</P>
<P>With all his magnitude and &s;trength, an elephant (if not &s;our'd by unkind u&s;age) may be rendered &s;o pa&s;&s;ive and gentle, as to be led and governed by a child. Ju&s;t repre&s;entation of that amiable <HI>meekne&s;s</HI> and <HI>humility,</HI> wherewith chri&s;tians of <HI>exalted rank</HI> conde&s;cend to men of <HI>low</HI> e&s;tate; and per&s;ons emi|nent for <HI>&s;uperior grace,</HI> or for <HI>di&s;tingui&s;hed learn|ing,</HI> bear with the infirmities, and are courteous to the ignorance of the weak. It was in this &s;pirit that the excellent Doctor WATTS de&s;cended from the regions of philo&s;ophy, and &s;tooped from the heights of more elevated poetry, to compo&s;e his admirable <HI>hymns for children,</HI> and teach infant warblers to li&s;p the prai&s;es of the great THREE-ONE.</P>
<P>The method by which wild elephants are <HI>taken,</HI> de&s;erves to be noticed. A narrow inclo&s;ure is made; one end of which is left open, for entrance; and, at the extremity of the other, &s;everal tame fe|male
<PB N="80" REF="031228_0085_0FEB7435F0B65E10">
elephants are placed. Between both (i. e. be|tween the entrance and the extremity where the females are fixed) a large pit is dug, who&s;e &s;urface is lined with a &s;light bridge-work, &s;o neatly turfed, that it has all the appearance of firm ground. Al|lured by the females, the male elephants make to|wards the place, but are &s;uddenly intercepted by the un&s;u&s;pected &s;nare. Proper per&s;ons, who are &s;tationed to watch the event, &s;tart from their con|cealments; and, with exulting &s;houts, mock the indignant di&s;tre&s;s of their unwieldy pri&s;oners.&mdash; Striking picture of the <HI>deceitfulne&s;s of &s;in</HI>; the unthinking folly of <HI>heedle&s;s minds</HI>; and the <HI>ter|rible effects</HI> of &s;ucce&s;sful temptation.</P>

<HEAD>A REMARKABLE DREAM OF THE LATE DR. DODDRIDGE.</HEAD>
<P>THE doctor and Dr. Clarke had been conver&s;ing together one evening upon the nature of the &s;eparate &s;tate, and the probability that the &s;cenes on the which the &s;oul would enter upon its leaving the body, would bear &s;ome re&s;emblance to tho&s;e with
<PB N="82" REF="031228_0087_0FEB743DD6046DC8">
which it had been conver&s;ant while on ear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h, that it might by degrees be prepared for the more &s;ublime happine&s;s of the heavenly world. This and other conver&s;ation of the &s;ame kind probably occa&s;ioned the following dream:&mdash;</P>
<P>The doctor imagined him&s;elf dangerou&s;ly ill at a friend's hou&s;e in London; and after laying in this &s;tate for &s;ome time, he thought his &s;oul left the body, and took its flight in &s;ome kind of fine vehi|cle, which (though very different from the body it had ju&s;t quitted) was &s;till material. He pur&s;ued his cour&s;e till he was at &s;ome di&s;tance from the city, when turning back, and reviewing the town, he could not forbear &s;aying to him&s;elf, How trifling and how vain do the&s;e affairs, in which the inha|bitants of this place are &s;o eagerly employed, ap|pear to me a &s;eparate &s;pirit. At length, as he was continuing his progre&s;s, and though without any certain director, yet ea&s;y and happy in the thoughts of the univer&s;al providence and government of God, which extends alike to all &s;tates and worlds, he was met by one, who told him he was &s;ent to conduct him to the place appointed for his abode; from whence he concluded that it could be no other than an angel, though, as I remember, he appear|ed under the form of an elderly man. They went accordingly on together, till they came within &s;ight
<PB N="83" REF="031228_0088_0FEB743FA7ABE240">
of a &s;pacious building, which had the air of a palace. Upon inquiring what it was, his guide told him it was the place a&s;&s;igned for his re&s;idence at pre&s;ent; upon which the doctor ob&s;erved, that he remembered to have read, while on earth, that "eye had not &s;een, nor ear heard, nor the heart conceived, what God had laid up for his &s;ervants;" whereas he could ea&s;ily have conceived an idea of &s;uch a building from others he had &s;een, though he acknowledged they were greatly inferior to this in elegance. The an&s;wer his guide made him was plainly &s;ugge&s;ted by the conver&s;ation of the evening: it was, that the &s;cene fir&s;t pre&s;ented was contrived on purpo&s;e to bear a near re&s;emblance to tho&s;e he had been accu&s;tomed to on earth, that his mind might be more ea&s;ily and gradually prepared for tho&s;e glories that would open upon him hereafter, and which would at fir&s;t have quite dazzled and over|powered him.</P>
<P>By this time they were come up to the palace; and his guide led him through a kind of &s;aloon into an inner parlour. The fir&s;t thing that &s;truck him was a large golden cup that &s;tood upon the table, on which was embo&s;&s;ed the figure of a vine and clu&s;ters of grapes. He a&s;ked his guide the meaning of this; who told him, it was the cup in which his Saviour drank new wine with his di&s;ciples in his
<PB N="84" REF="031228_0089_0FEB7442EE86CFF8">
kingdom; and that the figures cared on it were in|tended to &s;ignify the union between Chri&s;t and his people, implying, that as the grapes derive all their beauty and flavour from the vine, &s;o the &s;aints, even in a &s;tate of glory, were indebted for the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment and happine&s;s of their union with their Head, in whom they are all complete. While they were thus conver&s;ing, he heard a tap at the door, and was informed by the angel, that it was the &s;ignal of his Lord's approach, and was intended to prepare him for the interview. Accordingly, in a &s;hort time, he thought our Saviour entered the room; and, upon his ca&s;ting him&s;elf at his feet, he gra|ciou&s;ly rai&s;ed him up, and with a look of inexpre&s;|&s;ible complacency, a&s;&s;ured him of his favour, and his kind acceptance of his faithful &s;ervices: and, as a token of his peculiar regard, and the intimate friend&s;hip he intended to honour him with, he took the cup, and, after drinking of it him&s;elf, gave it into his hands. The doctor would have declined it at fir&s;t, as too great an honour; but his Lord re|plied, (as to Peter, in relation to wa&s;hing his feet) "If thou drink not with me, thou ha&s;t no part in me." This &s;cene, he ob&s;erved, filled him with &s;uch a tran&s;port of gratitude, love, and admiration, that he was ready to &s;ink under it. His Ma&s;ter &s;eemed &s;en&s;ible of it, and told him he mu&s;t leave
<PB N="85" REF="031228_0090_0FEB74494A4EAC00">
him for the pre&s;ent, but it would not be long be|fore he repeated his vi&s;it; and, in the mean time, he would find enough to employ his thoughts in re|flecting on what had pa&s;&s;ed, and in contemplating the objects around him. As &s;oon as his Lord was retired, and his mind a little compo&s;ed, he ob&s;erved the room was hung round with pictures; and, upon examining them more attentively, he di&s;covered, to his great &s;urprize, that they contained the hi&s;tory of his own life. The mo&s;t remarkable &s;cenes he had pa&s;&s;ed through being thus repre&s;ented in the mo&s;t lively manner, it may ea&s;ily be imagined how much this would &s;trike and affect his mind. The many temptations and trials he had been expo&s;ed to, and the &s;ignal in&s;tances of the divine goodne&s;s towards him in the different periods of his life, which by this means were all pre&s;ented at once to his view, excit|ed the &s;tronge&s;t emotions of gratitude; e&s;pecially when he reflected, that he was now out of the reach of any future di&s;tre&s;s, and that all the purpo&s;es of divine love and mercy towards him were at length happily accompli&s;hed. The ec&s;tacy of joy and thankfulne&s;s into which the&s;e reflections threw him, were &s;o great, that they awoke him. But for &s;ome con&s;iderable time after he aro&s;e, the impre&s;&s;ion con|tinued &s;o lively, that tears of joy flowed down his cheeks; and he &s;aid, that he never on any occa&s;ion

remembers to have felt &s;entiments of devotion, love, and gratitude, equally &s;trong.</P>

<HEAD>RESIGNATION.</HEAD>
<P>ONE of the mo&s;t remarkable in&s;tances of human re&s;ignation I ever remember to have met with, is to be found in the conduct of <HI>Archbi&s;hop Fenelon.</HI> When his illu&s;trious and hopeful pupil, the <HI>Duke of Burgundy,</HI> lay dead in his coffin, and the nobles of his court, in all the pomp of &s;ilent &s;adne&s;s, &s;tood weeping around, the <HI>Archbi&s;hop</HI> came into the apartment, and having fixed his eyes for &s;ome time on the <HI>corp&s;e,</HI> uttered the &s;en&s;ibility of his &s;oul to this effect:&mdash;"There lies my beloved prince, for whom my affections were equal to the tendere&s;t re|gard of the tendere&s;t parent. Nor were my af|fections lo&s;t; he loved me in return with all the ar|dor of a &s;on. There he lies, and all my worldly happine&s;s lies dead with him! But if the turning of a <HI>&s;traw</HI> would call him back to life, I would not, for ten thou&s;and worlds, be the turner of that &s;traw, in oppo&s;ition to the WILL of God."

<HEAD>AN ESSAY On the Influence of Grace upon the Soul of Man.</HEAD>
<P>AS, when a river is turned into a new channel, the &s;tream for&s;akes its ancient bed, and pur&s;ues a cour&s;e unknown till then; &s;o the &s;oul of man, when its native captivity to &s;in and death, is <HI>turned as the rivers in the South,</HI> flows back to God, from whom it ran before; nor cea&s;es to flow, till it has gained the ocean of infinite good.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="031228_0103_0FEB7467C7F4AEA0">This is the in&s;eparable effect of union and com|munion with Chri&s;t. The glorious liberty of the children of God, is a liberty from the darkne&s;s of unbelief, and from the bondage of moral corrup|tion, into the light of faith, the fire of love, and law of righteou&s;ne&s;s. That que&s;tion in the pro|phet, <HI>Can the Ethiopean change his &s;kin, or the leopard his &s;pots?</HI> admits of a favourable &s;olution. The converting SPIRIT of God does that for us which we could never do for our&s;elves. He makes the Ethiopean, in a moral &s;en&s;e, fair as the driven &s;now; and renders the &s;potted leopard &s;potle&s;s, in compari&s;on of what he was. The va&s;&s;als of ini|quity became ve&s;&s;els of glory; and the &s;oul that once cleaved to the du&s;t of &s;en&s;uality, and lay dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, is quicken'd from above, and made to &s;it in heavenly places with Chri&s;t Je&s;us. When the citadel of the human heart is taken by grace, the enemy's colours are di&s;placed; Satan's u&s;urped authority is &s;uper&s;eded; the &s;tandard of the Cro&s;s is erected on the walls; and the &s;piritual rebel takes the vow of willing allegiance to Chri&s;t, his rightful &s;overeign. The &s;trong holds to &s;in on one hand, and of &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s on the other, are batter'd down; and the &s;oul, from that ble&s;&s;ed moment, made free indeed, crys out, <HI>Other lords have had dominion over me; but the darkne&s;s is

pa&s;t, and the true light now &s;hines: the &s;nare is broken, and I am deliver'd.</HI></P>
<P>From this experience of the divine power in our own hearts, we cannot but adopt the cele&s;tial anthem, <HI>Glory to God in the highe&s;t, and on earth peace, good-will towards men!</HI> Our Conver&s;ion becomes known to all; and &s;ome of the practical effects, produced by, and connected with, that great di&s;play of grace, are the&s;e that follow:&mdash;</P>
<P>Where <HI>Lu&s;t,</HI> that fiery &s;erpent, was wont to crawl, divine LOVE kindles her hallow'd flame, and rai&s;es the affections, as on eagles' wings, to heaven.</P>
<P>Where <HI>Unbelief,</HI> blind and &s;ullen as the mole, lay wrapt in malicious gloom, loving darkne&s;s ra|ther than light, and &s;eeking to undetermine what &s;he had not eyes to &s;ee, FAITH diffu&s;es the bright|ne&s;s of cele&s;tial day, and leads the willing &s;oul to Him who bought her with his blood.</P>
<P>Where <HI>In&s;en&s;ibility,</HI> thoughtle&s;s as the bird that ha&s;tens to the &s;nare, and gay as a victim crowned for the &s;laughter, &s;ported on the precipice of de|&s;truction, and danced on the verge of death, &s;e|rious CONVICTION fixes her keen, but &s;alutary weapon; and filial FEAR keeps the avenues of the converted per&s;on's heart, and the actions of his life, in powerful, but &s;weet, re&s;traint.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="031228_0105_0FEB746FAE932050">Where <HI>Envy</HI> pined, where <HI>Malice</HI> hi&s;&s;ed, where <HI>Slander</HI> &s;harpened her tongue, and <HI>Pride,</HI> that bloated &s;nake, lifted her &s;welling cre&s;t; univer&s;al CHARITY throws wide her arms; HUMILITY &s;toops to the tendere&s;t offices of beneficence; and dove-like MEEKNESS &s;miles with benignity in her heart, and the law of candour upon her lips.</P>
<P>Where <HI>Intemperance</HI> mixed the intoxicating bowl, and lawle&s;s riot pu&s;hed the &s;uperfluous gla&s;s, &s;eeking to drown every thought of eternity, and to &s;ink the poor remains of human dignity, in the poi&s;onous draught; there, religious MODERATION marks out the limits; mindful of that more than golden rule, <HI>Whether ye eat, or drink, or what|&s;oever ye do, do all to the glory of God.</HI></P>
<P>Where <HI>Prophanene&s;s,</HI> a&s;&s;uming the ma&s;k of wit, &s;pawned the irreligious je&s;t, and &s;olicited the helli&s;h laugh, pro&s;tituting, perhaps, even the lan|guage of Scripture to the purpo&s;es of licentious mirth, and playing on the very words of the Holy Gho&s;t; trifling with &s;acred &s;ubjects, at which an|gels tremble, and lightly mentioning that adorable Name, at which angels bow; there, from the mo|ment of conver&s;ion, grace introduces a total change.

goodne&s;s, which, in&s;tead of turning him into hell, has turned him to God, and made him a living mo|nument, not of de&s;erved vengeance, but of un|merited mercy. His heart, which, till then, was a &s;ink of impurity and prophanation, is transform|ed into an hou&s;e of prayer; and his mouth, once the &s;eat of bla&s;phemy, is con&s;ecrated into an altar of prai&s;e.</P>
<P>Where <HI>Avarice</HI> &s;at brooding, tenacious as death, and in&s;atiate as the grave; unfeeling as marble, and deaf to the cries of di&s;tre&s;s, as the adder that &s;tops her ear: di&s;creet LIBERALITY unlocks the heart, and well-directed Beneficence extends her hand to be&s;tow. The language of the &s;oul is &s;imi|lar to that of Zacch&euml;us: <HI>Behold, Lord, the half of my goods, I give to the poor; and, if I have taken any thing from any man, by fal&s;e accu&s;a|tion, I re&s;tore him fourfold.</HI> The true believer, like his adorable Saviour, <HI>goes about, doing good,</HI> and &s;eeking whom he may relieve.</P>

<HEAD>A PRESERVATION.</HEAD>
<P>SIR James Thornhill was the per&s;on who paint|ed the in&s;ide of the famous <HI>cupola</HI> of St. Paul's, London. After having fini&s;hed one of the com|partments, he &s;tepped back, gradually, to &s;ee how it would look at a di&s;tance. He receded &s;o far (&s;till keeping his eye intently fixed on the painting) that he was got almo&s;t to the very edge of the &s;caf|folding, without perceiving it: had he continued to retreat half a minute more, he mu&s;t have fallen to the pavement beneath, and completed his de&s;truc|tion. A per&s;on pre&s;ent, who &s;aw the danger the great arti&s;t was in, had the happy pre&s;ence of mind to &s;natch up one of the bru&s;hes, and daubed it over the painting. Sir James, tran&s;ported with rage, &s;prung forward to &s;ave the remainder of the piece. But his rage was &s;oon turned into thanks, when the per&s;on addre&s;&s;ed him&mdash;"Sir, by &s;poiling the paint|ing I have &s;aved the life of the painter. You had advanced to the extremity of the &s;caffold, without

knowing it. Had I called to you, to apprize you of your danger, you would naturally have turned to look behind you; and the &s;urpri&s;e of finding your&s;elf in &s;uch a dreadful &s;ituation, would have ha&s;tened your fall. I had, therefore, no other me|thod of retrieving you but by acting as I did."</P>
<P>Not altogether di&s;&s;imilar to this is God's conduct to his people. It is the vain employ of &s;inful man, by the imperfect duties of his life, to draw his own portrait, in &s;uch delu&s;ive colours, as to e&s;teem him|&s;elf worthy the attention of the Almighty; and, after the performance is executed, to view him&s;elf in every favourable light to gratify the vanity of his &s;elf-righteous heart, although every &s;tep he takes in the review, ha&s;tens his unwary feet to a fall which mu&s;t complete his de&s;truction. But, it is the determination of the God of Grace, <HI>to &s;tain the pride of all human glory</HI>; and, as the by-&s;tander daubed the painting of Sir James Thorn|hill, purpo&s;ely to &s;ave his life from death, &s;o the LORD the SPIRIT mars our legal performances, &s;hews us the guilt that attends them, and their in|efficiency to ju&s;tify us before the tribunal of JEHO|VAH; then directs our attention to JESUS, the Son of God, <HI>the Lord our Righteou&s;ne&s;s; who, being the brightne&s;s of his</HI> FATHER<HI>'s glory, and the expre&s;s image of his</HI> PERSON, <HI>having purged

<P>ON a friend's &s;ugge&s;ting to Mr. Toplady the lo&s;s which the Church of Chri&s;t would &s;u&s;tain by his death, the utmo&s;t di&s;compo&s;ure was vi&s;ible in his countenance, and with extreme &s;en&s;ibility he exclaimed, "What, by my death? No! By my death? No! Je&s;us Chri&s;t is able, and will, by pro|per in&s;truments, defend his own truths. And with regard to what little I have been enabled to do in this way, not to me, but to his name, and to that only, be the glory." A &s;hort time preceding his death, his friend and phy&s;ician, on his own earne&s;t reque&s;t, informing him that his heart and arteries evidently beat, every day, weaker and weaker; he
<PB N="107" REF="031228_0112_0FEB74832CB079B8">
replied immediately with a &s;mile,&mdash;"<HI>Why, that's a good &s;ign, that my death is fa&s;t approaching; and ble&s;&s;ed be God, I can add, that my heart beats every day &s;tronger and &s;tronger for glory.</HI>"</P>
<P>Another friend took the liberty to a&s;k him, if in his pre&s;ent &s;ituation he had any <HI>doubt</HI> remaining upon his mind re&s;pecting the <HI>truth</HI> of tho&s;e prin|ciples he had &s;o warmly propagated in his mini&s;try. He replied,&mdash;"<HI>Doubt, Sir, doubt! Pray u&s;e not that word when &s;peaking of me. I cannot endure the term; at lea&s;t while God continues to &s;hine upon my &s;oul, in the gracious manner he now does. Not,</HI>" added he, "<HI>but that I am &s;en&s;ible, that while in the body, if left of him, I am capable, through the power of temptation, of calling into que&s;tion every truth of the go&s;pel; but that is &s;o far from being the ca&s;e, that the manife&s;tation and comforts of his love are &s;o abundant as to ren|der my &s;tate the mo&s;t de&s;irable in the world. I would not exchange my condition with any one upon earth. And with re&s;pect to my principles, tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed truths which I have been enabled in my poor mea&s;ure to maintain, appear to me more than ever, mo&s;t gloriou&s;ly indubitable. My own exi&s;tence is not, to my apprehen&s;ion, a greater cer|tainty. To me &s;ickne&s;s is no affliction; pain no cur&s;e; death it&s;elf no di&s;&s;olution.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="031228_0113_0FEB74865E1AAE28">A few days before his death, he &s;aid to a friend, with his hands cla&s;ped, and his eyes lifted up, flow|ing with tears of evident joy, "<HI>O, my dear Sir, I cannot tell you the comforts I feel in my &s;oul: they are pa&s;t expre&s;&s;ion! The con&s;olations of God to &s;uch an unworthy wretch are &s;o abundant, he leaves me nothing to pray for, but a continu|ance of them. I enjoy an heaven already in my &s;oul. My prayers are all converted into prai&s;e. Neverthele&s;s, I do not forget that I am &s;till in the body, and liable to all tho&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;ing fears which are incident to human nature when under temptations, and without any &s;en&s;ible divine &s;up|port. But &s;o long as the pre&s;ence of God conti|nues with me in the degree I now enjoy it, I can|not but think that &s;uch a de&s;ponding frame is im|po&s;&s;ible.</HI>" The nearer he drew to his decea&s;e, the more happy and heavenly he appeared in his &s;pirit and conver&s;ation. Founded upon the rock Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and influenced with the Father's ever|la&s;ting love, he &s;tands again&s;t the &s;hock of mortal|ity. The truth he preached to others, being the food and nouri&s;hment of his own &s;oul, he now finds their &s;weetne&s;s to counterpoi&s;e the &s;orrows of the grave. Happy, un&s;peakably happy is that man, and e&s;pecially that mini&s;ter, who is thus di|vinely taught and enriched by a God of all grace!

<P>Not long before his exit Mr. Toplady exclaimed, "<HI>O how this &s;oul of mine longs to be gone! like a bird impri&s;oned in a cage, it longs to take its flight.

The &s;ky is clear; there is no cloud; come Lord Je&s;us, come quickly!</HI>" Soon after this he clo&s;ed his eyes, the 11th of Augu&s;t, 1778, and found, as Milton ex|pre&s;&s;es it

Colonel. Are markets low that make you feel &s;o ugly?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Deacon, as old a man as you are you never heard the like in all your days; there is that great man Thomas Paine been writing again&s;t the <HI>bible,</HI> and a great many <HI>Yorkers</HI> take &s;ide with him, and if &s;omething is not done, they will all turn dei&s;ts. Here, Deacon Ridly, is the book; do look at it; I bought it at Swords's, in Pearl-&s;treet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Deacon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, I will look at this mighty book. Molly, hand me your grand-mother's &s;pec|tacles. Perhaps, Colonel, you are more afraid than hurt. I gue&s;s you are mi&s;taken about the folks in York; I have long thought many of them did not like the <HI>bible</HI> mighty well, and only wanted Tom Paine's fine French cloak to walk in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stay, Deacon, not quite &s;o hard;&mdash;Paine rea&s;ons de&s;perately indeed;&mdash;let me &s;hew you this place. Ah! there it is, he &s;trikes home at the root. (P. 13)&mdash;"Revelation, when applied to religion, means &s;omething communicated <HI>immediately</HI> from God to man. No one will deny or di&s;pute the power of the Almighty to make &s;uch a communi|cation if he plea&s;es. But admitting for the &s;ake of a ca&s;e, that &s;omething has been revealed to a cer|tain per&s;on, and not revealed to any other per&s;on, it is revelation to that per&s;on only. When he tells
<PB N="112" REF="031228_0117_0FEB7496CC4747B0">
it to a &s;econd per&s;on, a &s;econd to a third, and a third to a fourth, and &s;o on, it cea&s;es to be a reve|lation to all tho&s;e per&s;ons. It is a revelation to the fir&s;t per&s;on only, and <HI>here&s;ay</HI> to every other, and con&s;equently they are not obliged to believe it." Now Deacon, how am I to know whether the bible be a revelation of God or not&mdash;Is it <HI>here&s;ay</HI> to me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Deacon.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, &s;o, let me &s;ee if I can't take this <HI>Tom Fox</HI> by the tail, and take off his firebrand. Do Colonel hand me that book on the &s;helf; 'tis <HI>Paine's Common Sen&s;e.</HI>&mdash;See here,&mdash; (p. 7.) On monarchy and hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, he quotes the &s;criptures, and &s;ays, <HI>it is worth attending to,</HI> and &s;hews the origin, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the kings of I&s;rael; <HI>the&s;e portions of &s;cripture,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>are di|rect and po&s;itive; they admit o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to equivocal con|&s;truction</HI>; and then brings in the atte&s;tation of the Almighty in this ca&s;e. Here Colonel, you &s;ee, to point his pen again&s;t KINGS, he gives full credit to the bible, as much as any <HI>par&s;on</HI> in America; but when he got into France, he lo&s;t his "<HI>Common Sen&s;e,</HI>" and calls the bible a <HI>here&s;ay.</HI> Thus you &s;ee Paine is either a <HI>believer</HI> or an <HI>unbeliever,</HI> as &s;uits his own purpo&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Deacon, I never &s;aw you &s;o merry in all my born days; I thought to be &s;ure, you
<PB N="113" REF="031228_0118_0FEB749856A1BF38">
would have bur&s;t your eyes in tears! But look a little farther and you will &s;ee,&mdash;aye, there it is, (p. 50) how he talks about the Saviour having <HI>no learning,</HI> and that he could not <HI>write.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Deacon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, &s;o he does. Take the bible Colonel, and turn to John viii.6. and you will there &s;ee, <HI>Je&s;us &s;tooped down and with his finger</HI> WROTE <HI>on the ground,</HI> when the accu&s;ers of the adultre&s;s were before him. But, &s;ee here Colonel, in the very &s;ame page, Paine &s;ays, "Je&s;us Chri&s;t called men to the practice of moral virtues, and the belief of one God," therefore, Je&s;us mu&s;t have had the be&s;t &s;ort of learning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, Deacon. There is another place where he calls St. Paul a <HI>manufacturer of quibbles,</HI> (p. 54)&mdash;the book of Revelations is a <HI>riddle,</HI> (p. 32) and &s;ays <HI>the metaphor of a di&s;hclout</HI> might have been introduced as a <HI>type,</HI> (p. 146.)</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Deacon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Paul was con&s;i&s;tent in his writings, and not like Paine, in his Common Sen&s;e approving the Scripture, and in his Age of Rea&s;on denying it; therefore was no quibbler.&mdash;The Revelation may appear a riddle to Paine, &s;imply becau&s;e he had no eyes to read it, nor inclination to compare it with the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive events of time; and, as to the metaphor of a <HI>di&s;hclout,</HI> if he had looked &s;harp, he would have found it already in Jeremiah. <HI>All our righte|ou&s;ne&s;&s;es
<PB N="114" REF="031228_0119_0FEB749A08434F88">
are as filthy rags,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isaiah lxiv.6.</NOTE> and if poor Tom had known his own heart, he would have found it in God's &s;ight more filthy than the dirtie&s;t di&s;hclout ever handled by a &s;cullion in his kitchen. However, Colonel, as Dr. Linn &s;ays, in his Sermon on the <HI>Times,</HI> "That book, which hath for &s;o many ages &s;tood the roaring of the lion, may well &s;tand the braying of an a&s;s."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Paine al&s;o &s;ays that the Chri&s;tian Church &s;prung out of the tail of the heathen mythology; and, Deacon, there are many things in &s;cripture that look a little that way. (p. 17 and 97.)</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Deacon.</SPEAKER>
<P>I gue&s;s, Colonel, this rather comes from Paine's <HI>head</HI> than the heathen's tail. Now, Colo|nel, I wonder our <HI>dominies</HI> do not more explain the&s;e things to their people; but let that be as it may, if you compare the heathen mythology with the &s;cripture, you will find that the heathen mythology is a corruption from the &s;cripture; you know on man's expul&s;ion from Paradi&s;e, God placed <HI>che|rubims</HI> to guard the tree of life; and, no doubt, Cain being familiar therewith, he and his po&s;terity, on their &s;ettlement, not fearing the true God, made gods of their own from that figure. The &s;ame cherubims were appointed in the Tabernacle of Mo&s;es; in the Temple of Solomon; and, mightily &s;poken of by
<PB N="115" REF="031228_0120_0FEB749D54674058">
Ezekiel: now, the&s;e cherubims, in <HI>Hebrew,</HI> an&s;wer to the <HI>elements of Nature</HI>; and when the tribes revolted under Jereboam, they carried the idea of the&s;e hieroglyphics among the heathen, and thus, in my opinion, <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and all the other heathen gods, were e&s;tabli&s;hed and wor&s;hipped, as they all an&s;wer in their names and natures to the four faces of the cherubims, as you may &s;ee explained by the learned Mr. Parkhur&s;t, in his Hebrew Lexicon.</P>

<P>Then, Deacon, you don't believe what Paine &s;ays?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Deacon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you think I am &s;o fooli&s;h in my old age as to <HI>believe</HI> an <HI>unbeliever?</HI> No, no, let unbelievers credit one another if they plea&s;e; were I to believe &s;uch, my rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e might laugh in my face.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>What think you could induce that man to write &s;uch a book?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Deacon.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you, Colonel; you know Paine was then in the clutches of the French Convention, many of whom were dei&s;ts greater than him&s;elf; and, to recommend him&s;elf to their favour, and &s;ave his neck from Louis's cutting-knife, the <HI>gul|lotine,</HI> I gue&s;s he wrote again&s;t the bible. Another rea&s;on why he wrote again&s;t the chri&s;tian religion is, becau&s;e he had none in him&s;elf; if he had known him&s;elf a &s;inner, he would have &s;een the nece&s;&s;ity
<PB N="116" REF="031228_0121_0FEB74A3AD4EC528">
of a Saviour revealed, or peri&s;h. But, Colonel, I &s;ee Paine as in the hand of Providence. <HI>France,</HI> you know, for many ages, has been as <HI>cup</HI> of in|fidelity and &s;uper&s;tition: in order for the reception of the pure <HI>wine</HI> of the Go&s;pel, the <HI>cup</HI> mu&s;t be emptyed; and I look upon Paine's book as a ju&s;t de&s;cription of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of religion, if &s;uch it may be called, in that country; and thus he is the hand that &s;hews us the contents of the <HI>cup</HI> of abominations. The time, I believe, is not far di&s;tant, when truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall flouri&s;h among that people, and the pure doctrines of Chri&s;t &s;hall ari&s;e upon the ruins of infidelity. But, &s;tay Colonel, what is this he &s;ays, (p. 71)&mdash;"I keep no bible." The only true word in all his book, and a plain proof of his ignorance and contempt of the &s;ubject.</P>

<P>Deacon Ridly, I am mighty glad to hear you talk; it does me more good than all the &s;er|mons I have heard this month pa&s;t. I feel quite relieved;&mdash;do let's have a mug of your cyder, and I'll go and order my team to plough; and at an|other time I will a&s;k you more about this book, for I vow it had almo&s;t turned me up&s;ide down.</P>

<P>FOR a profe&s;&s;ed chri&s;tian to enter a place of pub|lic wor&s;hip when &s;ervice is half performed, is attend|ed with extreme di&s;advantages to him&s;elf, and many inconveniences to others; con&s;equently merits friendly admonition.</P>
<P>Such a per&s;on, however, may reply, "better late than never;" but, on &s;erious reflection, he mu&s;t find his tardy &s;teps expo&s;e him to &s;evere reflection.

Who can &s;uppo&s;e he has had time for either family or clo&s;et Devotion; or if performed at all, it mu&s;t have been in a bu&s;tle to get to Church before &s;ermon. May not many &s;teady wor&s;hippers imagine, that this &s;lothful chri&s;tian, however he may talk of loving &s;ermons, can have little idea of the true wor&s;hip of the great God, when he enters the door after pray|er? Should he be equally late in his attendance in the afternoon, who but may imagine he has too freely eat at his table; or has taken a few gla&s;&s;es too many? This, however, is certain, no one has

<P>This evil does not re&s;t alone upon or with him&s;elf. What a bad example does he &s;et his family, and others in the congregation, e&s;pecially young per&s;ons, who need every &s;timulus to duty! What an interrup|tion to public wor&s;hip is it for a per&s;on to bounce in, and almo&s;t out of breath, to take his &s;eat, while &s;ervice is performed? And, what a di&s;couragement is it to the mini&s;ter to &s;ee &s;o little fruit of his labour, and perhaps to be interrupted in his work by this negligent attendant, who catches the eye of every body in the church?</P>
<P>It is granted, that lawful, unavoidable ob&s;truc|tions may occur to prevent a per&s;on's timely atten|dance on wor&s;hip; where this is the real ca&s;e, it will create the pain of di&s;appointment in that brea&s;t which glows with ardour for Communion with God in his &s;anctuary; but it is to be feared, many, very many habitually neglect a due attendance on the hou&s;e of the Lord, and need admonition to quicken their &s;teps, which, if effected hereby, will an&s;wer the de&s;ired end of this paper.</P>

<P>ON Saturday in the afternoon, I promi&s;ed my&s;elf a &s;ingular plea&s;ure, the plea&s;ure of writing to your Lady&s;hip; but was hindered from enjoying it, by company which could not be left, and my bu&s;ine&s;s which could not be po&s;tponed.</P>

<P>The <HI>original</HI> of his love? It is free; perfectly free; without any de&s;ert, or the lea&s;t amiablene&s;s in us. We love our kind friends, and generous benefactors: tho&s;e that are accompli&s;hed in them|&s;elves, or &s;erviceable to our intere&s;ts. But CHRIST loved us when we were <HI>&s;inners</HI>; when we were <HI>forgetful</HI> of him; nay, enemies to him, by evil tempers, and wicked works. He loved us, (O &s;overeign, mo&s;t unmerited kindne&s;s!) when we de|&s;erved

<HI>nothing,</HI> but utter abhorrence, and eternal vengeance.</P>
<P>The <HI>commencement</HI> of his love. His love is not of ye&s;terday.

<P>The <HI>duration</HI> of his love. It is invariable and eternal. <HI>Having loved his own, he loveth them even unto the end.</HI> It neither began with time, neither will it end with time. As no worthine&s;s in us cau&s;ed it, &s;o neither will our failings extingui&s;h it; no, nor our infirmities damp it.

<P>THE late excellent and reverend Mr. James Hervey, Rector of We&s;ton Flavel, being one day on a journey, a lady who happened to be in the &s;ame carriage with him, was expatiating in a very particular manner on the amu&s;ements of the &s;tage, as being, in her e&s;teem, &s;uperior to any other plea|&s;ures. Among other things &s;he &s;aid, "There was the plea&s;ure of thinking on the play before &s;he went, the plea&s;ure &s;he enjoyed when there, and the plea&s;ure of ruminating upon it when on her bed at night." Mr. Hervey, (who &s;at and heard her di&s;cour&s;e without interrupting her) when &s;he had concluded, &s;aid to her, that there was one plea&s;ure more be&s;ides what &s;he had mentioned that &s;he had forgot. "What can that be?" &s;aid &s;he, "for &s;ure I have included every plea&s;ure, when I have con|&s;idered the enjoyment before hand&mdash;at the time&mdash; and afterwards. Pray, Sir, what is it?" To which Mr. Hervey, with a grave look, and in a manner peculiarly amiable to him&s;elf, an&s;wered, "Madam, the plea&s;ure that it will give you on your DEATH-BED."

The &s;troke went to her very heart, and &s;he had not one word to &s;ay, but &s;eemed quite occupied in thinking upon it. In &s;hort, the con&s;equence of that well-timed word was, that &s;he never went any more to the play-hou&s;e, but became a pious woman, and a follower of tho&s;e plea&s;ures which would afford her true &s;atisfaction on her death-bed.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>LOVE to God is the e&s;&s;ence of per&s;onal reli|gion; without it the mo&s;t &s;plendid profe&s;&s;ion is un|&s;atisfying and vain. It will be our attempt in this e&s;&s;ay to explain the principles on which God has
<PB N="146" REF="031228_0151_0FEB7502B01956D8">
a right to demand our affections, and the felicity of that man who loves the Lord with all his heart.</P>
<P N="1">I. From the natural relation which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts be|tween God and the creature, he has a right to de|mand our affections. When the Almighty form|ed man, he enriched his &s;oul with a propen&s;ity to love; and upon the exerci&s;e of this pa&s;&s;ion the ba&s;is of human happine&s;s was formed. Love is the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible, operative, vi&s;ible pa&s;&s;ion of the human &s;oul, and leads every other in its train; in the exerci&s;e of this our fir&s;t parents, in their primeval &s;tate, gra&s;ped the vi&s;ion of JEHOVAH, as the God of univer&s;al Nature, and thereby experienced the mo&s;t inconceivable delight. This claim is con&s;i&s;t|ent with the honour of God, and the intere&s;t of his creature, and is &s;upported by an holy and an inflexible <HI>law</HI>; the tenor of which is, <HI>Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy &s;oul, and with all thy &s;trength.</HI> Deut. vi.4, 5. Adam, in Paradi&s;e, did thus love the Lord his God; but, on the entrance of &s;in, the know|ledge of God was turned into darkne&s;s, the affec|tions were contaminated, enmity reared its baneful head, and man fled with precipitation from the voice of his Maker. Nor was this change in Adam's heart peculiar to him alone&mdash;by his <HI>di&s;obedience many were made &s;inners.</HI> Rom. v.19. <HI>The carnal
<PB N="147" REF="031228_0152_0FEB7504434D2760">
mind is enmity again&s;t God; it is not &s;ubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</HI> Rom. viii.7. Je&s;us &s;aid unto the Jews, <HI>I know ye that ye have not the love of God in you.</HI> John v.42. Thus, although man be under a natural and moral obligation to love God, and the divine right to the creature's affections &s;till abides, the fact is too &s;tubborn to be denied, that mankind, univer&s;ally &s;o by nature, <HI>are lovers of plea&s;ure more than lovers of God.</HI> 2 Tim. iii.4. Let the reader apply this to his own heart, and a&s;k, "Have I loved the Lord with all my heart, with all my &s;oul, and with all my &s;trength?" Surely he has not. This view of human nature calls for deep humiliation. Not to love God is to be de&s;titute of a pure fountain of happine&s;s, and to be expo&s;ed to the awful pe|nalty of death, annexed to the law of our Sove|reign. Glory be to God, that GRACE has re&s;tor|ed what NATURE lo&s;t! Therefore,</P>
<P N="2">II. God claims the affections of his people from the principle of their ADOPTION to HIMSELF in CHRIST JESUS flowing from the good plea&s;ure of his will. Eph. i.5. This, though unintelligible to nature, is the grand theme of revelation, and is the only way in which the depraved &s;inner can be brought to love the Lord with delight. It was the act of the FATHER to adopt; JESUS engaged to
<PB N="148" REF="031228_0153_0FEB750768D677C0">
a&s;&s;ume our nature, bear our &s;ins, magnify the law of love which we had violated, atone for &s;in by the &s;hedding of his blood, and prove our adoption in HIMSELF worthy the attributes of JEHOVAH. The SPIRIT of ADOPTION, in the fulne&s;s of time, is &s;ent into the con&s;cience of a redeemed &s;in|ner, &s;hews him his condemnation for &s;in, te&s;tifies of Chri&s;t as a complete Saviour, &s;heds abroad the love of God in his heart, and enables him to ap|proach and enjoy God as his father. Gal. iv. 4&mdash;6. Rom. v. 5. How different is the &s;tate and &s;en&s;i|bility of &s;uch a man to what they were! The en|mity of his heart is &s;lain; he feels the force of re|conciliation to God, and enjoys peace in his con|&s;cience; he neither boa&s;ts of loving God upon the principles of nature, nor cavils at adopting grace, but exults in the everla&s;ting, di&s;tingui&s;hing love of FATHER, SON, and SPIRIT to him; by which he is brought to know and feel the &s;weets of loving God. He that enjoys but the &s;malle&s;t degree of love to God, though he may not to be able to re|cite any remarkable circum&s;tances in his conver|&s;ion, is able to tell you that there was a time when he did not know nor love God; and what little he now enjoys is the fruit of great grace. Thus, <HI>we love</HI> GOD <HI>becau&s;e he fir&s;t loved us,</HI> &s;ent his SON to die for us, and then gave us his SPIRIT, to
<PB N="149" REF="031228_0154_0FEB750DC1D14948">
unite our hearts in love to him&s;elf, bearing te&s;ti|mony that unle&s;s God had thus loved us we never &s;hould have been re&s;tored to enjoy the &s;weets of love to him. To this we add,</P>
<P N="3">III. GOD, as the REDEEMER of his people, has a right to their affections, from their per&s;onal &s;urrender of them&s;elves to him, as the fruit of his own grace. That heart which reviews its own native wretchedne&s;s by tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, contemplates the boundle&s;s love of God in his &s;alvation, and is brought nigh, by the blood of CHRIST, to enjoy the &s;miles of the EVERLASTING FATHER, re|members that <HI>he is not his own, but bought with a price.</HI> He approaches the Lord by faith and prayer, and adopts the language of David: <HI>Into thine hand I commit my &s;pirit, for thou ha&s;t re|deemed me, O Lord God of truth.</HI> P&s;. xxxi.5. In the retired chamber, at the water of bapti&s;m, at the gates of Zion, and at the table of the Lord, the Chri&s;tian, in lively emotions of heart, re&s;igns him&s;elf to be the Lord's for ever: No part of re|vealed truth but he receives in the love of it; no command which dropped from his Saviour's lips, whether for private or public obedience, but is em|braced with affection; no cro&s;s, no &s;uffering, but what he cheerfully welcomes; knowing that the many waters of affliction cannot quench the flame
<PB N="150" REF="031228_0155_0FEB750FA2C79C38">
of his love to God, neither can the floods of temp|tation drown it. Sol. Song viii. 7. For the truth of the&s;e ob&s;ervations I appeal to the &s;criptures, and to the experience of the Chri&s;tian reader. You have not repented giving your hand and heart to HIM who bought you with his blood. From the principle of your &s;urrender to God he addre&s;&s;es you, <HI>My &s;on, give me thine heart.</HI> Prov. xxiii.26. This claim is founded upon your <HI>&s;on&s;hip,</HI> and is &s;upported by God's endearing relation to you as your <HI>father</HI> in <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> Frequently, in duty and in trial, in pro|vidence and in con&s;cience, Chri&s;t addre&s;&s;es you in his language to Peter, <HI>Love&s;t thou me more than the&s;e?</HI> John xxi. 15&mdash;17. As the High Prie&s;t un|der the law bore the names of the Hebrew tribes upon his brea&s;t-plate, &s;o Je&s;us, the great HIGH PRIEST of our profe&s;&s;ion, bears his people upon his heart; and by the methods of his grace he makes them to enjoy the comfort of that privilege, and then claims their hearts for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Let us now take the&s;e three parts of our &s;ubject, and view them as containing the principles of <HI>na|tural</HI> and <HI>revealed</HI> religion. On the principles of <HI>adopting grace,</HI> the obligation of <HI>nature's law</HI> is not annihilated, but e&s;tabli&s;hed. <HI>Grace</HI> re&s;tores what <HI>nature</HI> lo&s;t by &s;in. Though the honours of nature are re&s;tored by the obedience of Chri&s;t, and
<PB N="151" REF="031228_0156_0FEB7511332AE850">
our affections claimed by the Lord, remember it is by the di&s;play of adopting grace alone. You be|hold God not as Creator only, but in the new, eternal relation of your Father in Chri&s;t. You never can be too well e&s;tabli&s;hed in this important truth. Not viewing the believer's love, as flowing from his <HI>adoption,</HI> is the principal cau&s;e of blend|ing law and go&s;pel, nature and grace, obligation and privilege, together; and, from this almo&s;t every other error proceeds. By the go&s;pel your obedi|ence is directed into a new channel, and flows from the precious love of Chri&s;t: you are actuated by new motives, have new &s;ources opened for your per&s;everance in holy obedience, and a &s;ure and cer|tain pro&s;pect of <HI>receiving the end of your faith, in the final &s;alvation of your &s;oul.</HI> 1 Pet. i.9.</P>
<P><HI>Let them,</HI> &s;aid Deborah, <HI>that love the Lord, be as the &s;un when he goeth forth in his might.</HI> Judges v.31. How plea&s;ing the emblem to de|&s;cribe the happine&s;s of that man who loves the Lord with all his heart! like the SUN in the fir|mament, he &s;tands a monument of JEHOVAH's wi&s;dom and almighty power! As at the brightne&s;s of the <HI>&s;un</HI> the <HI>&s;tars</HI> withdraw their light, &s;o the redeemed of the Lord, wa&s;hed in the blood of the Lamb, cloathed with the immaculate righteou&s;ne&s;s of the God-man Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and repleni&s;hed with
<PB N="152" REF="031228_0157_0FEB75145EE5F150">
his everla&s;ting love, outvies the formal morali&s;t in pure obedience, and eventually he &s;hall out&s;hine the angels in the height of glory above!&mdash;As the SUN pur&s;ues his cour&s;e, and <HI>rejoices as a &s;trong man to run a race,</HI> though &s;torm and tempe&s;t fill the &s;ky; &s;o the man that loves the Lord &s;hall per|&s;evere through the raging tempe&s;ts produced by earth and hell; and the black clouds of affliction which &s;urround him, &s;hall only tend to make him &s;hine the brighter!&mdash;Not as an idle &s;pectator the SUN is placed in the centre of the mundane &s;y&s;tem, but governing the &s;urrounding <HI>planets,</HI> while his bright beams pierce through all the &s;kies; like the man who loves the Lord, placed in &s;ociety, diffu|&s;es his knowledge, candour, truth, benevolence, and zeal, for the happine&s;s of all around!&mdash;In one in&s;tance, however, the emblem fails. The period will arrive when that great &s;ource of light and heat &s;hall &s;et to ri&s;e no more, and be lo&s;t amid&s;t the wreck of nature: But <HI>the righteous &s;hall &s;hine forth as the &s;un in the kingdom of their Father, for ever and ever.</HI> Mat. xiii.43.</P>

<PB N="154" REF="031228_0159_0FEB751C7AFEEF90">
life, with all its habits, &s;eparate, and as di&s;tinct from <HI>the old body of &s;in,</HI> as the &s;oul it&s;elf is from the animal body. Titus iii.5. Eph. ii.1. John iii.6. 1 John iii.9. The <HI>Image</HI> of God is formed upon this <HI>new creature,</HI> in embryo, as much as the hu|man foetus po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all the habits, parts, and pa&s;&s;ions of man. Eph. iv.24. Col. iii.10. Rom. viii.29. Power, unfelt before, is now experienced&mdash;a con|flict commences in the con&s;cience, between this <HI>new life</HI> and the <HI>body of &s;in</HI>&mdash;a de&s;ire is produced, accompanied with an ability to turn unto God as the fountain of mercy, and to enjoy the light, the exerci&s;e, and the plea&s;ures, connected with a &s;piri|tual &s;tate of exi&s;tence. P&s;. cxvi.4. Acts ix.6.</P>
<P>CONVERSION is the &s;piritual deliverance of a &s;oul from a &s;tate of regeneration, and is therefore called a birth. John iii.3&mdash;5. It is the motion of the living &s;oul turning to God; and the exertion of &s;piritual life embracing God, as he is revealed in the &s;criptures, as the believer's happy portion in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, as much as by natural in&s;tinct the new-born infant applies for &s;u&s;tenance to its mother's brea&s;t. Jer. xxxi.18. Sam. iii.24. Now, the Image of God is di&s;played in obedience; and life becomes &s;en&s;ibly evident in the exerci&s;e of all its faculties. Gal. v.22. Therefore, he that is <HI>regenerated</HI> &s;hall, in due time, be <HI>converted</HI> to a life of happine&s;s in
<PB N="155" REF="031228_0160_0FEB751E0B9BF838">
God; for God cannot have a <HI>&s;till-born</HI> child; <HI>his work is perfect.</HI> Deut. xxxii.4. Eccl. xi.5.</P>
<P>To the&s;e ob&s;ervations may be added&mdash;In REGE|NERATION the &s;inner is <HI>pa&s;&s;ive</HI>; in CONVERSION he is <HI>active.</HI> REGENERATION is, by the &s;ecret operation of God's holy &s;pirit, <HI>alone</HI>; CONVER|SION is enjoyed by the &s;ame Spirit, through the <HI>mean</HI> of the word of truth. REGENERATION is <HI>once,</HI> and <HI>for ever</HI>; CONVERSION is frequently <HI>nece&s;&s;ary.</HI> Luke xxii. 32. James v.19. Let no man think of <HI>conver&s;ion,</HI> until he be fir&s;t <HI>regene|rated:</HI> Life mu&s;t be given before life can either be exerci&s;ed or enjoyed. Matt. xviii.3. This great work, of <HI>regeneration</HI> and <HI>conver&s;ion,</HI> flows from the everla&s;ting Love of the FATHER, through the Per&s;on of his SON CHRIST JESUS; and is produced in the &s;oul of guilty man, by the &s;ove|reign, invi&s;ible operations of the HOLY GHOST.

<HEAD>A SINGULAR INSTANCE OF CONVERSION.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. Mary Gurnee, now of New-York, was a per&s;on, like too many others, who lived a life of di&s;obedience, without the knowledge of God, or hope in Chri&s;t. Immediately on the delivery of her fourth child, it was &s;eized with violent fits; and as it lay at its mother's &s;ide, with its eyes darted upward and its hands clenched, the mother, while beholding the child's agony, &s;aid, <HI>Can it be pray|ing?</HI> No, thought &s;he, it has no &s;in of its own to pray for. In&s;tantly a thought darted to her mind, &s;wift as the lightning from the ea&s;t,&mdash;<HI>The child is praying for its ungodly mother, that never yet prayed for her&s;elf!</HI> In a few hours the child died. The conviction of di&s;obedience and guilt, however, lived within the mother's brea&s;t, and pro|duced a vi&s;ible reformation of life. Some time after &s;he obtained a &s;en&s;e of pardon in the blood of the Lamb, and for &s;everal years &s;ince has walked worthy of her chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion.</P>

However new or alluring the publication, I have always found in tho&s;e novels a golden bait, &s;uited to the youthful brea&s;t, and which diffu&s;es the baneful poi&s;on of di&s;&s;ipation; and, as tho&s;e volumes are

</FIGURE> THE FOX.</HEAD>
<P>THE Fox, in Greek <HI>Alopex,</HI> in Hebrew <HI>Shual,</HI> is an animal of the dog kind, much re&s;embling the common dog in form, and of the &s;ize of the &s;pa|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iel. It differs, however, from the common dog in the length, den&s;e di&s;po&s;ition, and &s;oftne&s;s of the hairs, e&s;pecially tho&s;e about its tail, which is bu&s;hy, and much admired by the animal it&s;elf, and in cold weather wrapped round his no&s;e; and in its &s;mell, which is peculiarly rank and offen&s;ive. It is &s;aid,
<PB N="174" REF="031228_0179_0FEB755D0AB0CD18">
that the fox makes u&s;e of its urine, which is re|markably foeted, to force the cleanly badger from its habitation, and takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it for him|&s;elf. Its u&s;ual colour is a reddi&s;h tawny, though it is &s;ometimes found white, and &s;ometimes black. Its manner of digging it&s;elf a hole in the earth is al&s;o a cu&s;tom wholly different from all the dog kind; and it is far from the tamene&s;s of that ani|mal, being with difficulty made to lo&s;e its fiercene&s;s. Of all animals the fox has the mo&s;t &s;ignificant <HI>eye,</HI> by which it expre&s;&s;es every pa&s;&s;ion of love, fear, hatred, &amp;c. The fox is a crafty, lively, libidinous animal; it breeds only once a year, unle&s;s &s;ome ac|cident befals its fir&s;t litter, and brings four or five young, which, like puppies, are born blind. They are di&s;tingui&s;hed by different names: the <HI>greyhound fox</HI> is the large&s;t, talle&s;t, and bolde&s;t, and will attack a grown &s;heep or wether: the <HI>ma&s;tiff fox</HI> is le&s;s, but more &s;trongly built: the <HI>cur fox</HI> is the lea&s;t, lurks about hedges and out-hou&s;es, and is the mo&s;t pernicious to the feathered tribe. The fir&s;t of the&s;e has a white tip to the tail; the la&s;t a black. The &s;kin of this animal is furni&s;hed with a &s;oft and warm fur, which is frequently u&s;ed to make muffs, &amp;c. The fox in the fir&s;t year is called a <HI>cub</HI>; in the &s;econd a <HI>fox</HI>; and afterwards an <HI>old fox.</HI> It is a bea&s;t of chace, u&s;ually very prejudicial to the hu&s;|bandman,

by taking away and de&s;troying his lambs, gee&s;e, and poultry; but in vineyards he commits the greate&s;t deva&s;tation, by eating the grapes and de&s;troying the vines. His &s;agacity and genius for &s;tratagem is peculiarly ob&s;ervable in his plunders. He is fond of honey; and as the wa&s;ps and bees fa&s;ten on his &s;kin, he either drowns them in water, or cru&s;hes them to death by rolling on the ground, till they are forced to leave him in unmole&s;ted po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of their cells. The very fretful porcupine, in the expan&s;ion of its prickles, he wearies out, by his artful and teazing tricks, and then kills and eats him. When pinched with hunger, he indi&s;crimi|nately feeds on quadrupeds, fowls, fi&s;hes, and veget|ables; nothing comes ami&s;s to him. The common way to catch him is by gins, which being baited, and a train made by drawing raw fle&s;h acro&s;s his u&s;ual paths or haunts to the gin, it proves an in|ducement to lure him to the place of de&s;truction. He is &s;ometimes taken by hunting, of which &s;port the dogs are extremely fond, though it often proves very offen&s;ive to the no&s;e of the hunt&s;man. This creature, on being pur&s;ued, &s;hews a&s;toni&s;hing powers of running, turning, winding, fighting, and eluding the hounds, often urining upon his tale, to &s;trike his pur&s;uers in the face; and when he finds him&s;elf without farther re&s;ource, he boldly faces

<P>HOW remarkable is it, that &s;uch a creature as the fox, &s;o fly, even to a proverb, &s;o filthy in his na|ture, and &s;o de&s;tructive in his life, &s;hould be favour|ed with &s;uch peculiar in&s;tinct, as to provide him|&s;elf with &s;o commodious and &s;ecure an habitation!

nature and grace; fle&s;h and &s;pirit; the old man and the new. Although the experience of the heart admits of different degrees of combat and &s;en&s;ibility, light and darkne&s;s, plea&s;ure and pain, yet there can be no chri&s;tian, as &s;uch, without &s;ome mea&s;ure of experience; it is ab&s;olutely in&s;eparable from his ex|i&s;tence as a believer, either as a babe, a young man, or a father, in Chri&s;t. A &s;ubject, therefore, of this magnitude is worthy a place in this publication, and demands the mo&s;t &s;erious attention of our nu|merous readers.</P>
<P>The AUTHOR of chri&s;tian experience is the Spirit of God. This &s;entiment our Lord taught in his di&s;cour&s;e to the Jews: <HI>He that believeth on me, out of his belly &s;hall flow rivers of living waters. This &s;pake he of the Spirit which they that believe on him &s;hould receive.</HI> John vii.38, 39. To the woman of Samaria he explained the &s;ame truth: <HI>Who&s;oever drinketh of the water that I &s;hall give him, &s;hall never thir&s;t; but &s;hall be in him a well of water &s;pringing up into everla&s;ting life.</HI> John iv.14. This <HI>well</HI> is dug in the &s;inner's <HI>Regeneration</HI>; the &s;acred <HI>water</HI> &s;prings in <HI>Conver&s;ion,</HI> flows through every channel of <HI>Obedience,</HI> repleni&s;hes the heart under the &s;e|vere&s;t &s;ufferings, and creates tho&s;e &s;ublime plea&s;ures which bear the &s;oul above the fears of death, in
<PB N="195" REF="031228_0200_0FEAF876EE0BD398">
pro&s;pect of immortal joys. Nor can we omit citing the great channel of experience which our Lord hath given us under the expre&s;&s;ive emblem of the <HI>vine and the branches,</HI> the vital &s;ap of which, the power of the Ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, produces the buds of de&s;ire, the leaves of profe&s;&s;ion, the fragrant flowers of comfort, and the riche&s;t fruit of love to God and man. The experience of God's grace and love, the e&s;&s;ence of religion, can no more be enjoyed in the brea&s;t of a &s;inner without the Spirit of God, than the branch can bear fruit without a living union with the vine. John xv. 1 &mdash; 5. As it was the office and work of CHRIST to make atonement for &s;in, by the &s;hedding of his blood; &s;o it is the office and work of the SPIRIT to bring &s;inners into the know|ledge and experience of that great &s;alvation. For a man to profe&s;s his faith in the per&s;on and work of Chri&s;t, without being able to give a te&s;timony of the work of the Spirit upon his heart, is the mo&s;t awful delu&s;ion&mdash;<HI>If any man have not the Spirit of Chri&s;t, he is none of his,</HI> let his profe&s;&s;ion be as brilliant as it may. Rom. viii.9.</P>
<P>The STANDARD of experience is the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. As the Holy Gho&s;t dictated the authors of the bible, &s;o the go&s;pel, in all its variety, fulne&s;s and glory, is applied to a believing &s;oul <HI>in the de|mon&s;tration of the</HI> &s;ame <HI>Spirit, and of power.</HI>

1 The&s;&s;. i.5.ii.13. <HI>To the law, and to the te&s;|timony; if they &s;peak not according to this word, it is becau&s;e there is no light in them.</HI> I&s;aiah viii.20. It is in the volume of revelation alone that we know how God pardons &s;in&mdash;how it is our guilty con&s;cience can have peace with God&mdash;how we may walk happily with him&mdash;what are the enemies we have to fight again&s;t&mdash;and by what means we are made more than conquerors. It is here alone that we learn the great, the glorious act of JEHOVAH, in adopting his children in Chri&s;t&mdash; what are their features, trials, mercies, duties, pri|vileges, and &s;ecurity. A con&s;iderable part of this &s;acred book exhibits, in the mo&s;t lively colours, the EXPERIENCES of God's children, for many thou|&s;and years; and it is mo&s;t certain, that there is no man who has been made a partaker of God's grace, but has found, in the lives of bible &s;aints, an exact copy of his own frames, feelings, fears, hopes, and joys. Let the men of grace be of whatever lan|guage, nation, or particular vi&s;ible denomination, they may, the pure language of experience which God promi&s;ed to turn to the people of his love, is the &s;ame, that they may call upon the name of the Lord, and &s;erve him with one con&s;ent. God's truth can alone be the criterion of God's work. That experience which flows from Chri&s;t, and re&s;ts upon
<PB N="197" REF="031228_0202_0FEB759E05963CA0">
his word, will &s;atisfy, and abide; while that which is derived from outward means only, and exi&s;ts in mere frames, fits and pa&s;&s;ions, &s;hall vani&s;h as the &s;moke, or prove as the morning cloud and as the early dew which pa&s;&s;eth away. Ho&s;ea vi.4. There were &s;ome in the church at Corinth, and &s;uch will be found in every church, who neglected the &s;tand|ard of the go&s;pel, and e&s;timated their &s;tate by the feelings, gifts, and experiences of each other. <HI>We dare not make our&s;elves of the number, or compare our&s;elves with &s;ome, that commend them&s;elves: but they, mea&s;uring them&s;elves by them&s;elves, and comparing them&s;elves among&s;t them&s;elves, are not wi&s;e.</HI> 2 Cor. x.12. If he that tru&s;teth in his own heart is a fool, equally &s;o mu&s;t he be that tru&s;ts in another. Let us derive plea&s;ure from reciting our experiences to each other; but, let the word of the Lord be the light unto our feet, and a lamp unto our path, to a&s;certain the perfection of our expe|rience, and the &s;afety of our &s;tate.</P>
<P>The PROGRESS of experience is, in &s;cripture, called, <HI>growing in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI>; 2 Pet. iii.18. and, <HI>a growing up into Chri&s;t in all things.</HI> Eph. iv.15. It is analogous to he advance of ve|getable nature; <HI>fir&s;t the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.</HI> Mark iv.28. And,

to the advance of humanity&mdash;<HI>babe, youth, man|hood, old age</HI>; with all the pa&s;&s;ions, activity, du|ties, virtues, and advantages of each &s;tage. 1 John ii.13, 14. The&s;e productions of nature, like the growth of the &s;oul in grace, are gradual and im|perceptible, and only to be a&s;certained by their pe|riods, light, &s;trength, and virtue. The fir&s;t efforts of grace are de&s;cribed as <HI>&s;eeing men as trees walk|ing,</HI> Mark viii.24. its advance and completion <HI>to the unity of the faith, the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the mea&s;ure of the &s;tature of the fulne&s;s of Chri&s;t.</HI> Eph. iv.16. The prophet Ezekiel gives us a mo&s;t delightful view of this &s;ubject, in his de&s;cription of the flowing of the water that i&s;&s;ued out from under the thre&s;hold of the hou&s;e of the Lord; the depths of which were, to <HI>the ancles&mdash;the knees&mdash; the loins&mdash;and waters to &s;wim in, a river that could not be pa&s;&s;ed over.</HI> Ezekiel xlvii.1&mdash;5. In the advance of experience, we cannot but perceive that faith, hope, love, repentance, meekne&s;s, long-&s;uffering, and truth, as derived from Chri&s;t, oppo&s;e the baneful powers of unbelief, de&s;pair, hatred, pride, malice, and every other evil that ari&s;es from the old body of &s;in that lodges within the &s;oul. By this conflict the chri&s;tian is led more deeply to know and to loath the vilene&s;s of &s;in, pants after greater
<PB N="199" REF="031228_0204_0FEB75A2EC266DE0">
conformity to Chri&s;t, and cleaves unto the Lord with full purpo&s;e of heart. The more powerfully the &s;nares of the world and &s;atan &s;urround him, the more ardently he breathes for communion with God. The more &s;en&s;ibly he feels his own imper|fections, the more he cries for the enjoyment of the fulne&s;s of Je&s;us, and rejoices in him as the great High Prie&s;t, who hath made atonement, and bears the iniquities of our mo&s;t holy things. This con|flict Paul felt, and hath left us a copy of his ex|perience in the &s;eventh chapter of the Romans. He that is a partaker of the &s;ame grace, can, more or le&s;s, adopt his language in the fifth chapter&mdash; <HI>Therefore, being ju&s;tified, by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; by whom al&s;o we have acce&s;s by faith into this grace wherein we &s;tand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. And not only &s;o, but we glory in tribu|lation al&s;o, knowing that tribulation worketh pa|tience, and patience experience, and experience hope; and hope maketh not a&s;hamed, becau&s;e the love of God is &s;hed abroad in our hearts, by the Holy Gho&s;t, which is given unto us.</HI></P>
<P>The MEANS by which experience is advanced are nece&s;&s;ary to be under&s;tood. As vegetable nature pro&s;pers by the rays of the &s;un, and the rains from above, &s;o the chri&s;tian is indebted to the beams
<PB N="200" REF="031228_0205_0FEB75A475044BD0">
of Chri&s;t, the glorious Son of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and to the con&s;tant influences of the Ble&s;&s;ed Spirit.&mdash; As the body depends upon the air in which we breathe for the comforts, u&s;e, and exertions of ani|mal life, &s;o the &s;oul is ince&s;&s;antly dependant on the Spirit of God for all the &s;upport, con&s;olation, and activity, connected with a life of faith on Chri&s;t. As the advance of animal nature is promoted by activity and indu&s;try, &s;o the chri&s;tian finds an in|finite variety of duties, per&s;onal and relative, in the world, in the clo&s;et, in the family, and in the church; the performance of which is connected with his hope in God, and his love to his Saviour. But, perhaps, experience is more rapidly advanced, and more &s;trongly rooted, in the furnace of afflic|tion. It was in this furnace that the faith of the primitive chri&s;tians was found to be more precious than gold that peri&s;heth. 1 Pet. i.7. Never did a believer pa&s;s through &s;uffering, but, either in it or after it, he was convinced that he could not have done without it. The Lord made Jo&s;eph fruitful in the land of his affliction. Gene&s;is xli.52. And in all the Lord's di&s;pen&s;ations to his people, he promotes their humility, increa&s;es their faith, and gives them the greater enjoyment of his pre&s;ence. It is very ob&s;ervable, that the annual &s;ea&s;on that ripens the corn in the ear, is mo&s;t attended with
<PB N="201" REF="031228_0206_0FEB75A7C02F4590">
thunder, lightning, &s;torm, and tempe&s;t; and, many excellent chri&s;tians have found, that the nearer they advanced to the clo&s;e of life, temptations and af|flictions increa&s;ed upon them: and thus, as an oar of wheat ripe for the &s;ickle, he bows his head in humility, &s;elf-denial, and obedience; while the lan|guage of his heart is, Come, Lord Je&s;us, come quickly!</P>
<P>To conclude this e&s;&s;ay: let the profe&s;&s;or of re|ligion be per&s;uaded to try his experience by the te&s;|timony of the go&s;pel. P&s;m. cxxxix.23, 24.&mdash;Let not the weak in faith be di&s;couraged: although a <HI>babe</HI> in grace, be thankful for what you enjoy, and remember, God giveth more grace. James iv.6.&mdash; Let tho&s;e who have good experience of pardon, peace and love in God, be ready to give a rea&s;on of the hope that is in him with meekne&s;s and fear; proving the genuinene&s;s of his profe&s;&s;ion by the holine&s;s of his life. Matt. v.16.&mdash;And, let tho&s;e who advance to the la&s;t &s;tage of life know, that God will not for&s;ake the work of his own hand; but that you &s;hall come to the grave in a full age, like a &s;hock of corn cometh in in its &s;ea&s;on. Job v.27.</P>

<HEAD>THE RELIEF.</HEAD>
<P>A CLERGYMAN of the &s;tate of New-York, not many years &s;ince, through a mi&s;apprehen&s;ion of a leading member, was precipitately deprived of his pulpit, which involved a large family in ne|ce&s;&s;ity. At &s;upper, the good man had the pain of beholding the la&s;t mor&s;el of bread placed upon the table, without the lea&s;t means or pro&s;pect of a &s;upply for his children's breakfa&s;t. His wife, full of grief, with her children, retired to her bed. The mini&s;ter cho&s;e to &s;et up and employ his dark hours in prayer, and in reading the promi&s;es of God. Some &s;ecret hope of &s;upply pervaded his brea&s;t; but when, how, what, whence, or by whom, he knew not. He retired to re&s;t, and in the morning appeared with his family, and performed the duty of prayer. It being the depth of winter, and a little fire upon the hearth, probably to keep the poor children's expectations alive, that breakfa&s;t &s;hould &s;oon be enjoyed, he de&s;ired his wife to hang on the kettle, and &s;pread the cloth upon the table.&mdash;The kettle boiled&mdash;the children cried for bread: the af|flicted father, &s;tanding before the fire, felt tho&s;e emotions of heart unknown to tho&s;e who&s;e tables are repleni&s;hed with affluence.

When the gentleman was gone the letter was opened, and, to the mini&s;ter's a&s;toni&s;hment, it contained a FOUR POUNDS BANK BILL, with a de&s;ire of acceptance. So manife&s;t an interpo&s;ition of Divine goodne&s;s could not but be received with gratitude and joy; and, &s;hould be a le&s;&s;on to others to tru&s;t in that Saviour who hath &s;aid, <HI>Verily thou &s;halt be fed.</HI> P&s;m. xxxvii.3. <HI>I will never leave thee, nor for&s;ake thee.</HI> Heb. xiii.5.</P>
<P>This remarkable occurrence being communi|cated to the EDITOR, who, having an intimacy with the gentleman &s;aid to be the hand that offered the &s;ea&s;onable relief, was determined, the next time he made him a vi&s;it, to introduce the &s;ubject, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to know the rea&s;on that induced the generous action. The &s;tory was told&mdash;the gen|tleman di&s;covered a mode&s;t blu&s;h, which evinced the tenderne&s;s of his heart. On interrogation, he &s;aid "He had frequently heard that mini&s;ter: on a certain morning he was di&s;po&s;ed for a walk; thought, in the &s;everity of the winter &s;ea&s;on a trifle might be of &s;ervice, as fuel was high; felt a kind of nece&s;&s;ity to inclo&s;e the money in a letter; went

the mind of man, childhood and youth would bear the &s;orrows of old age; the powers of genius would fail; art be unimproved; and nature her&s;elf unex|plored. How little does the bu&s;y worldling reflect on his obligation to infinite goodne&s;s, for his ability to perform the duties of his &s;tation, and that the uncertainty of future events demands his con&s;tant dependence upon the plea&s;ure of the Almighty! Tho&s;e who&s;e minds are directed to the Supreme, know, that the providence of God is a my&s;tery to man in all ages.

<P>If the ob&s;ervations now made, as they relate to men in common life, be pronounced ju&s;t, I may venture to add, that the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of God, in withholding the knowledge of future events, is more highly e&s;teemed by the real Chri&s;|tian than by tho&s;e who&s;e habit of di&s;&s;ipation de|prives them of an ability to ob&s;erve the di&s;pen&s;a|tions of the Almighty.

The Chri&s;tian &s;ometimes a&s;cends the mount of con|templation; &s;urveys the <HI>map</HI> of his pa&s;t <HI>experi|ence</HI>; remembers the way which the Lord his God hath led him; and in the review his &s;oul is filled with profound a&s;toni&s;hment!

From this rich, inex|hau&s;tible profu&s;ion of Nature's garden, let us at lea&s;t &s;elect the ROSE of SHARON, &s;urvey its beau|ties, and collect its &s;weets.</P>
<P>The ROSE, <HI>ro&s;a,</HI> is acknowledged a genus of the polygamia order, belonging to the ico&s;andria cla&s;s of plants. The &s;orts of ro&s;es are very nume|rous. Turnefort reckons no le&s;s than fifty-three, and botani&s;ts find it very difficult to determine with accuracy, which are &s;pecies, and which are varie|ties, as well as which are varieties of the re&s;pec|tive &s;pecies. On this account, Linnaeus, and &s;ome other eminent authors, are inclined to think, that there is only one real &s;pecies of ro&s;e, which is the <HI>ro&s;a canina,</HI> or dog-ro&s;e of the hedge, and that all the other &s;orts are accidental varieties of it. How|ever, according to the pre&s;ent Linnaean arrangement they &s;tand divided into fourteen &s;uppo&s;ed &s;pecies, each comprehending &s;ome varieties, which in &s;ome &s;orts are but few, others numerous.</P>

mo&s;t delightful in its colours, and the riche&s;t in its fragrance. This invites our choice, becau&s;e it is an emblem of Immanuel's glory, and endears our hearts to him. Sol. Songs ii.1.</P>
<P N="1">1. The beauty of its colours, <HI>red</HI> and <HI>white,</HI> expre&s;&s;ive the&s;e of the glory of the God-head, and the &s;orrows of the humanity of Chri&s;t. <HI>My be|loved,</HI> &s;aid the church, <HI>is white and ruddy.</HI> Sol.

WHITE is properly no colour at all, but a compo&s;ition of all colours; the light of the &s;un, therefore, &s;aid Sir I&s;aac Newton, is only white, becau&s;e con&s;i&s;ting of all colours: neither is BLACK, its oppo&s;ite, a colour, but a deprivation of all colours, therefore the proper emblem of wretchedne&s;s and death. Apply the&s;e ob&s;erva|tions to the &s;cripture te&s;timony of Jehovah: <HI>God is light, and in him is no darkne&s;s at all,</HI> 1 John i.5. demon&s;trative this of that underived, &s;elf-ex|i&s;tent purity, happine&s;s, truth, love, and glory, which, without the &s;hadow of variation, di&s;order, and imperfection, is e&s;&s;ential to Deity. That this excellence, peculiar to Jehovah, is a&s;cribed to Je|&s;us, the current of &s;cripture evinces. Aaron, the High Prie&s;t, was to wear a pure linen garment un|der the ephod, to repre&s;ent the invi&s;ible divinity under the humanity. Daniel &s;aw the Me&s;&s;iah, <HI>the Ancient of days,</HI> with a <HI>garment white as &s;now.</HI>

Nor does it le&s;s intimate tho&s;e &s;orrows which mankind experience as the fruit of di&s;obedience.

Ca&s;t then your eyes upon THE ROSE OF SHARON, produced, may I &s;ay, on purpo&s;e to exhibit by its colour the &s;ame truth which revelation teaches.

<P N="2"><PB N="215" REF="031228_0220_0FEB75D6EB3C6F88">2. The odoriferous <HI>&s;cent</HI> of the Ro&s;e of Sharon a&s;&s;i&s;ts us to contemplate the precious virtues of the Lord of glory. How richly does this &s;weet ro&s;e pour forth its fragrance to gratify the &s;en&s;e! yet more richly does Je&s;us di&s;play the glories of his name; opens the unbounded love of his heart; ap|plies a full pardon bought with his mo&s;t precious blood; proclaims, by his go&s;pel, the inconceivable fulne&s;s of his grace as an all-&s;ufficient &s;upply for our &s;upport, comfort, per&s;everance, &s;anctification, and everla&s;ting felicity. Je&s;us, the Ro&s;e of Sha|ron, is ever precious to them that believe; yet there are &s;pecial &s;ea&s;ons when his delights are more &s;en|&s;ibly enjoyed. David exclaimed, <HI>Though I walk in the mid&s;t of trouble, thou wilt revive me.</HI> P&s;m. cxxxviii.7. And thou&s;ands in every age have enjoy|ed more &s;en&s;ible comforts in Chri&s;t, at a period of affliction, than ever they experienced in a time of ea&s;e and affluence. <HI>For as the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t abound in us, &s;o our con&s;olation al&s;o a|boundeth by Chri&s;t.</HI> When the church attends the &s;upper of the Lord, how often does the Redeem|er gladden their hearts with the light of his counte|nance, while communion, with bread and wine, yields the riche&s;t delight! But, however precious and delightful the Ro&s;e of Sharon may be to us in our pa&s;&s;age through life, in the article of de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th, far
<PB N="216" REF="031228_0221_0FEB75DD434C48B8">
&s;uperior enjoyments are conferred. <HI>Precious in the &s;ight of the Lord is the death of his &s;aints.</HI> When fle&s;h and heart fail; when the &s;weets of hu|man friend&s;hip are no longer to be enjoyed; when the riche&s;t cordials and the mo&s;t delicious produc|tions of nature cea&s;e to gratify the ta&s;te, and pol|lute upon the lips, then for the &s;oul to be regaled with the &s;miles of Je&s;us, the delightful Ro&s;e of Sha|ron, how great is the ble&s;&s;ing! Sheltered beneath Immanuel's wings, and &s;weetly &s;olaced with his love, how many thou&s;ands have launched into eter|nity with a &s;mile, and hailed the promi&s;ed crown of life!</P>
<P N="3">3. The medicinal virtues of the ro&s;e affords us further aid to explore the excellence of the Lord Chri&s;t. There is not a more rich perfume than the e&s;&s;ence of ro&s;es. The ro&s;e di&s;tilled with wa|ter yields a &s;mall portion of a butyraceous oil, who&s;e flavour exactly re&s;embles that of the ro&s;e it&s;elf. This oil, and the di&s;tilled water, are very u&s;eful and agreeable cordials. A con&s;erve of ro|&s;es is of various u&s;es, particularly in relieving im|perfections attending the eye, and of meliorating and removing complaints, unnece&s;&s;ary now to be mentioned.</P>
<P>But whence the&s;e medicinal virtues of the ro&s;e? Do they flow while blooming in the field? No:
<PB N="217" REF="031228_0222_0FEB75DECD0F5688">
this delightful flower mu&s;t be cut down, ca&s;t into a Still, and undergo the &s;everity of fire, before its e&s;&s;ence can be enjoyed. Solemn thought this, when applied to Chri&s;t, the Ro&s;e of Sharon! He appeared in all the perfection of humanity, and di&s;played the glory of divinity thirty-three years; then was cut down by death, the in&s;trument of ju&s;|tice, ca&s;t into the grave, &s;u&s;tained the fire of divine anger again&s;t &s;in, and thus, as the Redeemer of his people, yielded the virtues of his &s;acrifice, for their pardon, peace, and happine&s;s in God. There is no virtue in the ro&s;e to regale the fainting &s;pirits, re|&s;tore the wa&s;ted frame, heal the ob&s;tructed &s;ight, or cure the burning fever, but what there are infi|nitely greater virtues in a crucified Je&s;us, to cure &s;imilar, nay, every di&s;order po&s;&s;ible incident to the &s;oul of man. Thou&s;ands in every age, under the mo&s;t complicated mental evils, have received with joy the virtues of the Ro&s;e of Sharon; and thou|&s;ands &s;till, and thou&s;ands more, &s;hall enjoy its &s;a|cred &s;weets and triumph in its prai&s;e!</P>
<P N="4">4. SHARON, (that is, <HI>a plain or field</HI>) the native &s;oil of the lovely ro&s;e, will help us to conceive a few more thoughts of the adored Redeemer.

By the pre|&s;ence of the Lord, this wilderne&s;s, &s;olitary place of our earthly pilgrimage, dreary as the de&s;ert, is made to blo&s;&s;om as the ro&s;e. I&s;aiah xxxv.1, 2. Wher|ever his love is experienced, there is that &s;acred joy which can only be exceeded by drinking at the fountain head in glory!</P>
<P>As the Ro&s;e grew upon Sharon's plain, free for all who had eyes to &s;ee, &s;en&s;e to &s;mell, or hands to embrace, &s;o Je&s;us is freely and fully publi&s;hed in his go&s;pel. <HI>Who&s;oever will, let him come, and him that cometh unto me, I will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out.</HI> But, tho&s;e who have neither eyes to &s;ee, nor &s;en&s;e to &s;mell, pa&s;s by the Ro&s;e of Sharon, treat it with di&s;dain, and attempt to cru&s;h it under foot.</P>
<P N="5">5. No Ro&s;e without its Thorn; no, not even the Ro&s;e of Sharon! Who takes Chri&s;t mu&s;t take the cro&s;s too. <HI>If any man will be my di&s;ciple, let him deny him&s;elf, take up his cro&s;s, and follow me.</HI> If any man will live godly in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, he mu&s;t &s;uffer per&s;ecution.

<P>THAT a per&s;on who, through grace, has enjoy|ed the rich manife&s;tations of a Saviour's &s;miles, and hath been numbered with Chri&s;t's vi&s;ible flock, may be liable to fall into temptation, lo&s;e the bloom of his profe&s;&s;ion, and the comforts of his &s;oul, for a &s;ea&s;on, is a truth &s;o evident in the &s;criptures, and &s;o convicting in the con&s;cience, as at once demands our a&s;&s;ent and our tears. Although it be ab&s;o|lutely impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe every &s;en&s;ation of a back&s;liding heart, and the many erring paths to which &s;uch are expo&s;ed, I &s;hall, in this paper, draw the general outline of &s;uch an unhappy ca&s;e, and add my fervent prayer, that God may make it a mean to alarm the carele&s;s, humble the di&s;obedi|ent, and reclaim the wanderer.</P>
<P>True religion begins with Chri&s;t; he is our par|don, peace, hope, and everla&s;ting &s;alvation. To

&s;it under his &s;hadow, and by faith experience the fruit of his pa&s;&s;ion, &s;weet to our ta&s;te, con&s;titutes the &s;ublime happine&s;s of our &s;ouls: It is therefore evident, that the fir&s;t &s;tep to our departure from God, and our errors in life, begins at the cro&s;s. John vi.68. The eye is allured from beholding the per&s;on of Je&s;us and the heart partially cea&s;es; to have &s;en&s;ible enjoyment of his grace and his love. Perhaps this ob&s;ervation may meet with conviction in the reader's brea&s;t;&mdash;the time is re|membered, that when impre&s;&s;ed with guilt, and loaded with di&s;tre&s;s, he re&s;ted at the cro&s;s, beheld the bleeding Lamb, and felt peace and plea&s;ure with God. Then, how ince&s;&s;ant was the panting of the heart <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> communion with the Saviour! the lea&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, and the &s;malle&s;t evil, keenly wounded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;oul, and made the eyes flow with tears. But now, though the name of Chri&s;t be ap|proved, it is not preciou&s;ly enjoyed. The &s;oul and Chri&s;t &s;eldom meets in love, and feels the &s;weets of pardon in his blood. A &s;hyne&s;s has taken place, and the perfidious conduct of the Chri&s;tian deeply convinces his con&s;cience, and leaves him without excu&s;e. Perhaps the Saviour's charge may reach the reader's ears, and pierce his guilty brea&s;t:&mdash;"<HI>Know, therefore, and &s;ee, that it is an

evil, and a bitter thing, that thou ha&s;t for&s;aken the Lord thy God.</HI> Jer. ii.19.</P>
<P>As by the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t we are brought nigh to God, and enjoy the &s;weets of fellow&s;hip with him as our Father; &s;o, a neglect of the virtues of the cro&s;s imperceptibly ob&s;tructs us in the enjoy|ment of that high privilege. Our communion with God is carried on by faith, meditation, and prayer; the e&s;&s;ence of which is, the &s;ecret motion of the &s;oul in peace, adoration, hope, love, and joy; pro|ducing that &s;olid &s;atisfaction and &s;ublime plea&s;ure, which none but he that feels it knows. This ex|perience con&s;titutes our heaven upon earth. We thus walk with God, and never feel our&s;elves un|happy but when interrupted in this holy path. Whatever affliction may attend us, it is in commu|nion with God that our tears are wiped away, learn the de&s;ign of every adver&s;e providence, and receive grace to help in time of need. Perhaps the reader may bring to recollection the time when he enjoyed this privilege with &s;weet delight, drew near the Lord by prayer, could tell him all your grief, and receive the &s;atisfaction which gave you bold|ne&s;s to pur&s;ue the path of life with joy; but, you are con&s;cious it is not &s;o now. You pray; but it is not in prayer: your meditations are attended with darkne&s;s; your faith is &s;urrounded with &s;uch amaz|ing
<PB N="225" REF="031228_0230_0FEB75F727968968">
unbelief, that often induces you to que&s;tion if ever you believed at all; and the motion of your heart to God is in great coldne&s;s and heavine&s;s. Thus, when you would do good, evil is ever pre|&s;ent with you; and a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt hur|ries you away from prayer, and increa&s;es the di&s;|tance of your &s;oul from God. Standing thus as on the thre&s;hold of the clo&s;et, you are ripe to em|brace any temptation which &s;atan may propo&s;e. Thou&s;ands of mo&s;t excellent Chri&s;tians have mark|ed this fatal &s;pot, where apo&s;tacy more vi&s;ibly be|gan. If David could &s;ay, <HI>It is good for me to draw near to God,</HI> O how extremely bitter and dangerous the con&s;equence of living at a &s;en&s;ible di&s;tance from God! Chri&s;tian, where art thou? <HI>Take heed le&s;t there be in you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God</HI>; for, be a&s;&s;ured, <HI>the back&s;lider in heart &s;hall be filled with his own ways.</HI> Prov. xiv.14. And, if you feel it not now, it will be more &s;evere at a future period. You know not whither you may be led by &s;in, therefore return unto the Lord, from whom you have deeply revolted.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of &s;en&s;ible communion with God &s;oon di&s;covers it&s;elf in the di&s;po&s;ition of the mind, and in the actions of the life. The Word of the Lord was precious in tho&s;e days when the Chri&s;tian lived

near to God: now it is read with indifference, without faith, without prayer, without a de&s;ire to find Chri&s;t, and a determination to follow his pre|cepts or embrace his promi&s;es. In the di&s;charge of dome&s;tic duties, the temper is altered; morning and evening prayer becomes formal; and the imperfec|tions of &s;ervants and children are pa&s;&s;ed over with|out reproof, becau&s;e the con&s;cience is an accu&s;er of its own &s;in. Religious conver&s;ation, if held at all, is not upon the beauties of Chri&s;t, the riches of grace, or the experience of the heart; but, on &s;peculative points, the gifts of mini&s;ters, the mi&s;|fortunate mi&s;carriages of others, or (what is pretty fa&s;hionable among profe&s;&s;ors of this day) the de|cline of religion, without producing one effort to revive it in them&s;elves or others. The Lord's day now comes rather of cour&s;e, than from plea&s;ing anticipation. Public prayer is little enjoyed; and the preaching of the go&s;pel is not nouri&s;hing, for want of faith in him that hears it. Heb. iv.2.&mdash; Either the mini&s;ter is charged with barrenne&s;s, or the hearer thinks him&s;elf &s;ufficiently wi&s;e without fre&s;h in&s;truction: nor is it uncommon to find &s;uch a per&s;on going from one mini&s;ter to another, in &s;earch of <HI>&s;omething new</HI>; yet nothing really &s;atis|fies the heart, becau&s;e, the man is di&s;&s;atisfied with him&s;elf, and at a di&s;tance from the Lord. This

&s;piritual decline of heart paves the way for a more general neglect of the means of grace&mdash;lives above them, and concludes, he is as well at home, or walking in the fields, as he would be at church. Thus, no wonder that the man who has lo&s;t the comforts of grace in his &s;oul &s;hould mi&s;improve, or totally neglect the means of grace al&s;o.</P>
<P>Lut us now take one &s;tep farther with the re|volting Chri&s;tian, and mark the change which takes place in his conduct in the more bu&s;y &s;cenes of life. That &s;weet re&s;traint which a &s;en&s;e of the love of God once created upon his &s;oul, and directed his cautious &s;teps in forming his connections, manag|ing his trade, and an&s;wering his obligations, gra|dually wears away, and his heart takes a more &s;peedy flight after all which the world calls good and great. He may now pa&s;s for a <HI>polite Chri&s;ti|an</HI>; having the name, but de&s;titute of the &s;pirit of a lively believer, and of cour&s;e tries pretty hard to make his profe&s;&s;ion and his worldly pur&s;uits com|port with each other. The men of bu&s;ine&s;s can|not, however, but perceive that this man has con|&s;iderably lo&s;t the fine bloom of his religious pro|fe&s;&s;ion, and triumphantly exclaim&mdash;<HI>See, the man hath become like one of us!</HI> It is now that he &s;tands in the way of indulging tho&s;e maxims, and committing tho&s;e evils which before his &s;oul abhor|red,
<PB N="228" REF="031228_0233_0FEB75FF60417240">
and which he &s;everely reproved in others. Sa|tan meets him upon his own ground, &s;uits his bates to the frame of his heart, and, by every method in his infernal power, blinds his mind, hardens his heart, and pollutes his pa&s;&s;ions. Here, at lea&s;t, let us &s;top&mdash;No man's pea, or tongue, can a&s;certain how far, and to what wretched lengths a man in &s;uch a &s;tate may go;&mdash;rather than attempt &s;uch a pur&s;uit, it is the wi&s;h of the writer of this paper to a&s;k the reader, <HI>Is this ca&s;e your own?</HI> Happy for you, if it is not. Te&s;tify your gratitude to God; live upon Chri&s;t; plead his Spirit; keep his &s;tatutes; watch the motion of your heart, and you are happy indeed! But, if this de&s;cription of a back|&s;lider, in either, or in all its &s;tages, &s;hews your own likene&s;s, and your con&s;cience &s;ays, <HI>Thou art the man,</HI> let me &s;olemnly intreat you to reflect upon your ca&s;e. Each &s;tage has an ea&s;y tran&s;itition to another; he that is not watchful of the fir&s;t, will &s;oon find him&s;elf in the next, and, like a rolling &s;tone, will find the way to the botton.</P>
<P>Remember, the &s;in of your departure from God has been committed with your eyes open. What ingratitude is this to God for his love&mdash;to Chri&s;t for his &s;alvation&mdash;and to the Ble&s;&s;ed Spirit for his in&s;truction and con&s;olation!&mdash;Did you not &s;olemnly devote your&s;elf to be the Lord's at your conver|&s;ion;

and have you not frequently renewed this &s;ur|render in private, at your bapti&s;m, and at the Lord's Supper?&mdash;What evil has the Lord done unto you? and wherein has he wearied you?

Are you as happy now as when you delighted beneath the Shepherd's care, and fed in the rich pa&s;ture of his grace? O! no.

<P>Young per&s;ons are apt to trifle with the thoughts of death, and imagine an horrid gloom to attend the practice of piety; and that it nece&s;&s;arily excludes the chri&s;tian from &s;ocial plea&s;ures; but &s;uch conclu&s;ions are made by tho&s;e only who love to gratify tho&s;e depraved pa&s;&s;ions which the law of God condemns, and who never yet ta&s;ted happine&s;s in God. The&s;e, my daughter, you mu&s;t pronounce improper judges in the ca&s;e. Per&s;ons of true piety know that religion refines the gro&s;&s;er pa&s;&s;ions, creates a better reli&s;h for &s;ocial plea&s;ures, and in|&s;tead of introducing them to gloomy &s;hades, it is the only path by which they can e&s;cape that dreadful darkne&s;s which re&s;ted upon the mind of your de|parted friend.</P>

<P>I know, madam, we are too apt to be mi&s;led, and to &s;uppre&s;s thoughts of mortality; but I hope, from Charlotte's death, to be more &s;oli|citous for my future life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>In this your own happine&s;s and the comfort of your parents very much depend. Be|fore you quit my chamber, let me urge you to the duties of <HI>prayer,</HI> and reading the &s;criptures. Prayer is the opening of the heart to God&mdash;confe&s;&s;ing our guilt, and imploring his mercy. This is the great
<PB N="234" REF="031228_0239_0FEB7614B4656FD8">
duty which enlivens every other, and fills the &s;oul with the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction; but it is a duty to which, by &s;in, we are naturally aver&s;e. Beg the Lord to give you an heart to pray. Never &s;uffer your&s;elf to be a&s;hamed of this duty, however others may de&s;pi&s;e it. If it be an honour to conver&s;e with a king upon his throne, it is infinitely greater to have audience with the LORD OF GLORY, and delight beneath his heavenly &s;miles!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daughter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know this is a very great duty, nor do I wholly neglect it; but I have &s;o many unruly thoughts, and I know &s;o little of God, that it &s;eems almo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s for me to attempt to pray.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>This then, my child, will convince you of the importance of the other duty I recom|mended you,&mdash;the reading of the Scriptures. This gives us ju&s;t thoughts of the moral attributes of God,&mdash;&s;hews us how, in Chri&s;t, &s;inners are par|doned, and can have fellow&s;hip with God, by the aid of his Holy Spirit. The mind being e&s;tabli&s;hed in this, ten thou&s;and other precious &s;ubjects will unfold to your view, and give you the highe&s;t &s;a|tisfaction po&s;&s;ible. In the language of an excellent writer I may tell you, GO, READ THE BIBLE TO BE GAY. No plea&s;ures are &s;o refined as tho&s;e which flow from the love of God upon the heart; no &s;upports are equal to tho&s;e which the promi&s;es
<PB N="235" REF="031228_0240_0FEB76164A427ED0">
in&s;pire;&mdash;no pro&s;pects of futurity are &s;o rational and divine, as revelation opens to the believing mind. Although this duty might be performed at any time, yet I recommend you to attend to it in the morning, when the heart is free for contemplation. Begin with the P&s;alms and the Evangeli&s;ts, and read a chapter in each; and after you have done, fail not to propo&s;e &s;uch que&s;tions as the&s;e&mdash;What do I in the&s;e chapters learn of God?&mdash;Which ver&s;e leads me to di&s;cover the beauties of a Saviour, and convinces me of my need of Him? Which Pro|mi&s;e is mo&s;t &s;uited to encourage my mind, and which Precept appears nece&s;&s;ary for me to obey? Per&s;ons in general read a chapter, clo&s;e the book, and it is over;&mdash;but if &s;uch interrogations as I have propo&s;ed be made, they will never fail to impre&s;s the Scriptures more forcibly on your mind, inlarge your views of God and his grace, and con&s;equently give you the highe&s;t encouragement to perform the duty of prayer.</P>

<P>WITHOUT <HI>faith it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God,</HI> either in our thoughts, words, or actions. Heb. xi.6. <HI>Faith</HI> is &s;imply taking God at his word, as <HI>unbelief</HI> is giving God the lie. The
<PB N="242" REF="031228_0247_0FEB762FB84457B8">
&s;cripture te&s;timony concerning mankind is, <HI>they are children in whom is no faith.</HI> Deut. xxxii.20. and <HI>God hath concluded all in unbelief.</HI> Rom. xi.32. We need not trace the black circle of <HI>athe|i&s;ts, dei&s;ts,</HI> and modern <HI>free-thinkers,</HI> and li&s;ten to their awful expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t the being, ma|je&s;ty, providence, law and go&s;pel of God, to di&s;|cover the baneful fruit of unbelief; but, enter into our own brea&s;ts, where we are &s;en&s;ibly convinced that from this bitter root &s;pring tho&s;e thoughts and evil pa&s;&s;ions which are unworthy the true dignity of our nature, and bring us under the pain of damnation. Mark xvi.16. In this &s;tate mankind would have lived and died; and, in a future &s;tate of exi&s;tence, been compelled to <HI>believe</HI> the ju&s;tice of God, and the evil of &s;in, in their own puni&s;h|ment, had not God, in the glory of his grace, pro|vided a way by which guilty men &s;hould be brought back again to him&mdash;a new principle of faith creat|ed in their unbelieving &s;oul, and thus their moral and eternal happine&s;s &s;ecured.</P>
<P>The go&s;pel informs us, that <HI>faith is the gift of God</HI>; Eph. ii.8. that it is obtained through the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God and our Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, 2 Pet. i.1. and produced in the heart by the opera|tions of the Holy Spirit. Gal. v.22. Col. ii.12. It is a con&s;tituent part of that new life which Chri&s;t
<PB N="243" REF="031228_0248_0FEB763146FE5C08">
communicates to all his people, di&s;tingui&s;hing them in their &s;tate, &s;en&s;ibility, obedience, plea&s;ures, and pro&s;pects, from other men; and tho&s;e who have it are daily taught practically to believe that the growth, &s;trength, comfort, and lively exertion of their faith, wholly depend upon Je&s;us, who is <HI>the author and fini&s;her of our faith.</HI> Heb. xii.2. As faith is of &s;uch infinite con&s;equence to our pre&s;ent peace and future happine&s;s, I &s;hall, in this e&s;&s;ay, form a &s;hort collection of its virtues, and wi&s;h that they may be more highly experienced in every rea|der's brea&s;t.</P>
<P N="1">1. It &s;catters the clouds of <HI>&s;elf-de&s;ception,</HI> which naturally cover the depraved heart of man; &s;hews his true character as a &s;inner, and reveals his &s;tand|ing in Chri&s;t for eternity. Thus, he that believeth hath the witne&s;s in him&s;elf. 1 John v.10. God's word is the ground of faith: in this, as in a pure mirror, the enlightened &s;inner &s;ees his own likene&s;s, and is filled with &s;elf-aba&s;ement. His heart gradu|ally opens; its treachery, power, and vilene&s;s, in|duce him, were it po&s;&s;ible, to fly from him&s;elf. The immortality of the &s;oul, the con&s;equence of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, his obligation to the <HI>law,</HI> the certain|ty of death, the &s;olemnity of judgment, and the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of forgivene&s;s; the&s;e, and many other im|portant truths which before he either denied or neg|lected,
<PB N="244" REF="031228_0249_0FEB763475302E30">
are now conveyed to his con&s;cience, with the fulle&s;t demon&s;tration from the Almighty. He had often heard his character de&s;cribed by others; he had frequently felt the convictions of his own con&s;cience; he knew his heart was not altogether right with God; but now, by <HI>faith</HI> of the opera|tion of God, he knows his ca&s;e to be de&s;perate, and to live and die in &s;uch a &s;tate fills him with grief. All things within him, and around him, wear their true colours, and impre&s;s his &s;oul with that &s;olemn weight he never felt before. Proud nature, aided by &s;atan, may devi&s;e ten thou&s;and ways to recover it&s;elf; but &s;uch is the virtue of that <HI>faith</HI> by which the work was begun, that the &s;in|ner finds a perfect inability to amend his con&s;cience and obtain peace with God, and firmly <HI>believes,</HI> if ever he is &s;aved, it mu&s;t be by grace alone. The ear which once turned from the charming voice of the go&s;pel, now li&s;tens with attention. The per|&s;on of the God-man Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the perfection of his righteou&s;ne&s;s, the fulne&s;s of his atonement, the riches of his grace, the freene&s;s of his love to &s;in|ners, the chief of &s;inners, his mo&s;t inveterate ene|mies, engage the awakened mind, and create a longing for a &s;hare in &s;o great a &s;alvation. The word preached profits, being mixed with faith in him that hears it. He begins to under&s;tand the
<PB N="245" REF="031228_0250_0FEB76393864D420">
truth, which before he de&s;pi&s;ed, that, <HI>by the deeds of the law there &s;hall no fle&s;h be ju&s;tified in the &s;ight of God,</HI> becau&s;e they are imperfect and vile, which the law condemns and not accepts;&mdash;<HI>but now the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God, without the law, is manife&s;ted, being witne&s;&s;ed by the law and the prophets: even the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God by faith of Je&s;us Chri&s;t unto all, and upon all them that believe; for there is no difference.</HI> Rom. iii.21&mdash;23. This di&s;covers the go&s;pel to be worthy of its AUTHOR, and to contain a &s;uitable &s;alvation for the &s;inner. There can be no greater ground for faith in Chri&s;t than that the GOD again&s;t whom we have &s;inned, hath &s;et HIM forth in the go&s;pel, a <HI>propitiation through faith in his blood, to de|clare his righteou&s;ne&s;s in the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins that are pa&s;t, that he might be ju&s;t, and the ju&s;tifier of him which believeth in Je&s;us.</HI> Rom. iii.25, 26. Here re&s;ts our faith: cut off from this we peri&s;h. The belief of it engages the heart and &s;oul mo&s;t earne&s;tly to pray for it. The &s;ame ble&s;&s;ed Saviour who &s;aid, <HI>All things whatever ye &s;hall a&s;k in prayer, believing, ye &s;hall receive,</HI> Matt. xxi.22. in due time returns a gracious an&s;wer, by manife&s;t|ing him&s;elf to the trembling heart, &s;aying, <HI>Fear not, I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name, thou art mine.</HI> I&s;a. xliii.1. This is
<PB N="246" REF="031228_0251_0FEB763B12882400">
enough; faith credits the report, and brings the comfort of the promi&s;e. Chri&s;t dwells in the heart by faith. Eph. iii.12. My beloved is mine, and I am his. Sol. Song ii.16. The con&s;cience feels peace with God, being &s;atisfied with, and reconcil|ed by the blood of Chri&s;t. What joy and peace in believing! The &s;oul ca&s;ts it&s;elf into the bleeding bo&s;om of the Saviour, and finds re&s;t, pardon, com|fort, hope and happine&s;s indi&s;cribable. From what Chri&s;t is in him&s;elf, what he hath done for &s;inners, what he hath done for me, and my entering into the love of his heart, by faith; the&s;e are evidences to me of my intere&s;t in him, and I re&s;t a&s;&s;ured he will love me to the end. This experience of the heart is called <HI>the work of faith,</HI> 2 The&s;&s;. i.11. becau&s;e &s;uch are its &s;oul reclaiming, &s;aving virtues, which never could have been produced by nature, the powers of rea&s;on, the circle of the arts, nor all the objects of &s;en&s;e; and brings the highe&s;t honour to Jehovah.</P>
<P N="2">2. As the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t leads to communion with the Father, we will now examine the virtues of <HI>faith,</HI> in enabling us to walk humbly and hap|pily with him. This is the &s;ub&s;tance of religion. <HI>We walk by faith, not by &s;ight.</HI> 2 Cor. v.7. By faith we &s;ee him who is invi&s;ible to the eye of &s;en&s;e; enjoy the comforts of a covenant relation in God
<PB N="247" REF="031228_0252_0FEB763E38155490">
as our Father; exult in the glories of his attributes in our redemption, and walk in the light of his countenance. We know nothing of &s;uch a rela|tion of grace but as it is revealed in the Bible; and it is the virtue of faith to receive the truth as it is in Chri&s;t, and enjoy the comfort of it. It is the object of unbelief to rai&s;e a cloud between the chri&s;tian and his God, to interrupt the plea&s;ures of communion; but faith, nouri&s;hed by the Spirit of Chri&s;t, is &s;tronger than unbelief fed by &s;atan, and therefore the darkne&s;s &s;oon vani&s;hes, and the light of faith cheers the heart.&mdash;All our communion with God is maintained by faith in the blood of Chri&s;t. <HI>Having therefore, brethren, boldne&s;s to enter into the holie&s;t by the blood of Je&s;us, by a new and living way which he hath con&s;ecrated for us&mdash;let us draw near with a true heart, in full a&s;&s;urance of faith.</HI> Heb. x.19&mdash;22. It is the per&s;on and blood of Je&s;us, the great High Prie&s;t, that render our per&s;ons, prayers, and prai&s;es, ac|ceptable to God; and this is the way alone in which God will meet and commune with us; nor can we enjoy any &s;en&s;ible, lively communion with the Fa|ther, unle&s;s by faith we re&s;t upon the precious blood of the Lamb; guilt will &s;top our mouth, fears will ari&s;e in our brea&s;t, and our &s;pirits will &s;tand at a &s;orrowful di&s;tance from God.&mdash;As God hath given
<PB N="248" REF="031228_0253_0FEB76448C49FB18">
us exceeding great and precious promi&s;es, on which we may re&s;t our prayer, enjoy communion with him, and wait for the good things promi&s;ed; &s;o it is by <HI>faith</HI> that we embrace the promi&s;es, view them in Chri&s;t, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the grace and glory promi&s;ed, and who is engaged to make them good to all that believe. 2 Cor. i.20. It is not po&s;&s;ible for us to enjoy communion with the Father, &s;epa|rate from the Redeemer. <HI>Truly, our fellow&s;hip is with the Father, and with his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> To them that believe, Je&s;us is increa&s;ingly precious in all the &s;acred relations and offices he &s;u&s;tains; and it is the virtue of faith to lead the chri&s;tian, under all his nece&s;&s;ities, to <HI>employ</HI> Chri&s;t as his Prie&s;t, Prophet, King, and Shepherd; and thus, as he re|ceived Chri&s;t Je&s;us the Lord, &s;o he walks <HI>in</HI> him, and has the mo&s;t &s;olid peace of con&s;cience, and hap|pine&s;s of &s;oul in walking <HI>with</HI> the Father&mdash;Nor is it po&s;&s;ible that <HI>faith</HI> &s;hould be unconcerned about the influence of the Spirit of God, who implanted it in the heart. As by believing we know we have nothing, nor can we do any thing to rai&s;e our hearts to communion with God; &s;o the be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iever re&s;ts upon the Spirit to help his infirmities, te&s;tify of Chri&s;t, dictate his prayer, &s;eal his con&s;cience, and &s;hed abro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d the love of God in his heart. Le&s;t we ex|ceed the bounds allotted for this e&s;&s;ay, we will,</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="249" REF="031228_0254_0FEB764616247CD0">3. Proceed to enquire into the virtues of <HI>faith,</HI> in producing obedience. The &s;cripture &s;peaks of faith that purifieth the heart, and worketh by love, Acts xv.9. Gal. v.6. and that the go&s;pel was preached among all nations for the <HI>obedience of faith.</HI> Rom. xvi.26. Faith creates new princi|ples, affords the &s;ublime&s;t motives, and propo&s;es the mo&s;t glorious ends, on which an immortal &s;oul can act before God and man. God is our mo&s;t gracious, everla&s;ting Father, and we obey his will, not as &s;laves, but as his adopted children. Chri&s;t hath bought us with his precious blood, and we yield our&s;elves to him as our Sovereign, Lord, and King. Introduced by grace into his &s;piritual king|dom, we receive from his hand THE LAW OF FAITH, Rom. iii.27. the <HI>go&s;pel,</HI> &s;anctioned by his divine authority, and inforced by his redeeming love. In this law is contained every precept e&s;&s;en|tial to our walk with God, the wor&s;hip due to his name, the government of our&s;elves, our conduct in the world, our conflict with our enemies, and our fellow&s;hip with the &s;aints. So far from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of faith leading men into neglect and licentiou&s;ne&s;s, it is the &s;pring to every good word and work; for, as it hath been often &s;aid, "He that hath St. Paul's <HI>faith</HI> will never fail to prac|ti&s;e St. James's <HI>works.</HI>" The chri&s;tian firmly be|lieves
<PB N="250" REF="031228_0255_0FEB7647AF7FC658">
that there can be no precept which the wi&s;|dom of his Saviour enjoins in the law of faith, that can be trivial and unnece&s;&s;ary; therefore his obe|dience is univer&s;al, and, with David, <HI>he has re|&s;pect unto all God's te&s;timonies.</HI> The virtues of faith produce the highe&s;t plea&s;ures and cheerfulne&s;s in obedience&mdash;It is my Father's command&mdash;my Sa|viour's love con&s;trains&mdash;it is connected with my character&mdash;it may promote the happine&s;s of another, and di&s;play the honour of my Lord; therefore, with an enlarged heart I will run the way of his commands, and think my&s;elf happy to obey. <HI>Let us then hold fa&s;t the profe&s;&s;ion of our faith with|out wavering, for he is faithful that promi&s;ed: and let us con&s;ider one another unto love and good works; for herein is our Father glorified, that we bear much fruit.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. As the Lord's are a poor and an afflicted people, they need a <HI>Faith,</HI> who&s;e virtues &s;hall bear them above their deepe&s;t &s;orrows. The believer has trials in common with other men; and he has afflictions peculiar to him&s;elf, the chief of which are found within his own brea&s;t. As a di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t, he believes his Lord and Ma&s;ter has wi&s;ely allotted a <HI>cro&s;s,</HI> for the exerci&s;e of his faith, the trial of his patience, and the proof of his &s;incerity, and therefore it is with cheerfulne&s;s he takes it up.
<PB N="251" REF="031228_0256_0FEB76498CE83300">
The word of God contains many &s;alutary cordials for &s;uffering chri&s;tians, and &s;hews them, that, how|ever &s;evere, they &s;pring from a Father's love, and are de&s;igned to promote their real intere&s;t. <HI>Belov|ed, think it not &s;trange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though &s;ome &s;trange thing had happened unto you; but rejoice, in as much as ye are partakers of Chri&s;t's &s;ufferings; that, when his glory &s;hall be revealed, ye may be glad al&s;o with exceeding joy.</HI> 1 Pet. iv.12.13. <HI>We know that all things work together for good to them that love God.</HI> Rom. viii.28. Afflictions brighten, manife&s;t, and improve the virtues of faith; and faith makes afflictions fruitful of real good, al|ways to the &s;oul, and frequently to the body. It is as an anchor to the &s;oul, keeping it quiet in the bo&s;om of the Father's love, that, however long and &s;evere, the &s;torm &s;hall produce a brighter &s;ky, and make him more humble, patient, watchful, obedi|ent, and happy. He believes there is no rod held in his Father's hand without honey at the end&mdash;no cro&s;s without a crown&mdash;nor crown without a cro&s;s. The darker the providence, the more intricate the path; and the more violent the oppo&s;ition, the greater is the opportunity for faith to di&s;cover its intrin&s;ic virtue. It will hang upon Chri&s;t in the mid&s;t of a wreck&mdash;it will tru&s;t him when he &s;eems to have
<PB N="252" REF="031228_0257_0FEB7651CC92DB58">
for&s;aken&mdash;it will always &s;hine the brighte&s;t when there is the lea&s;t objects of &s;en&s;e to &s;urround it&mdash; it will draw con&s;olation from the ancient tran&s;ac|tions of God in eternity, and look forward with tran&s;port to futurity. It is impo&s;&s;ible to enumerate or to e&s;timate the virtues of faith! It however &s;hines brighte&s;t in the furnace: there can be no &s;ight &s;o honourable to God, &s;o gratifying to the be|holder, and &s;o convicting to the eye of infidelity, as to &s;ee a chri&s;tian &s;tripped of the creature, yet full of love to the Creator; &s;urrounded with thick darkne&s;s, yet light in the Lord; walking on the borders of de&s;pair, yet believing in hope again&s;t hope, that every event &s;hall terminate to the honour of God and the real happine&s;s of him&s;elf!</P>
<P N="5">5. If &s;uch are the virtues of <HI>faith</HI> to a chri&s;tian in life, they mu&s;t be &s;uperior in the article of death. Of the long li&s;t of ancient worthies contained in the 11th of Hebrews, it is &s;aid, <HI>the&s;e all died in faith!</HI> To profe&s;s faith is ea&s;y; to po&s;&s;e&s;s faith is a ble&s;&s;ing which none but God can give; to die in faith, is to enjoy more peace, and more happine&s;s than ten thou&s;and worlds can be&s;tow; and which can only be exceeded by the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the glories of immortality! If by faith all things were di&s;covered in their true colours, and felt in their due weight of influence upon the mind in life, much
<PB N="253" REF="031228_0258_0FEB765395357568">
more &s;o the nature, appendages, and end of death become vi&s;ible, and all things around now become truly &s;olemn! By faith the dying chri&s;tian takes a view of Death, clad in all his native horrors, lead|ing mankind to an awful &s;tate of puni&s;hment due to their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; feels the &s;entence within him|&s;elf, and drops the &s;ilent tear&mdash;Then looks on Chri&s;t, who has conquered Death, and perfumed the grave with his own ble&s;&s;ed body, and from a lively faith of intere&s;t in him cries, "This God is my God, and he &s;hall be my guide even through death!&mdash;Though fle&s;h and heart fail, the Lord &s;hall be the &s;trength of my life and my portion forever! &mdash;I am per&s;uaded that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things pre&s;ent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, &s;hall be able to &s;e|parate me from the love of God, which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us my Lord!" Nor does faith yield its virtues only in the immediate article of dying: No&mdash;

So extremely &s;hort are many of the vici&s;&s;itudes of life, one needs &s;omething more than mortal to prepare us for them, and pre&s;erve us in a virtuous path. How often does the mariner &s;it with ea&s;e at his helm, the gentle gale fills the &s;heets, and his cheerful heart hails his port in view!&mdash;but, the wind &s;hifts, the tide turns, the clouds lower, and, in a little while, his bark is da&s;h|ed with the &s;torm, and nought but death appears!

<P>In &s;ocial life, next to be e&s;teemed to the ble&s;&s;ings of grace, is an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">onourable connection in marriage. Entering into &s;uch a relation, either hazards, or promotes our happine&s;s in pa&s;&s;ing over the ocean of time, and generally has a very con&s;iderable influ|ence upon our morals. To marry only for beauty, is to purcha&s;e a hou&s;e for the no&s;e-gay in its win|dow, which mu&s;t &s;oon fade, and probably prove ob|noxious to its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. To marry only for riches, is to deceive our own pa&s;&s;ions, and eventually makes us poor indeed. Our own affections too often de|ceive us in common things; and therefore, in &s;uch an important connection as this, the utmo&s;t delibera|tion and care are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, infinitely more &s;o than that yonder mariner, who ploughs the ocean, &s;hould fir&s;t have a&s;certained the &s;tability of his ve&s;&s;el, before he put to &s;ea. The &s;afe&s;t way is to &s;eek direction from that adored Saviour, who vouch&s;afed his pre&s;ence at a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and we may be certain, that marriage

<P>HAVING attempted, in No. V. page 222, to de&s;cribe the &s;everal &s;tages of a revolting chri&s;tian, and the aggravations of his conduct; agreeably to my promi&s;e I &s;hall, in this paper, enumerate &s;ome of tho&s;e means by which the GOOD SHEPHERD re&s;tores his wandering &s;heep, and the &s;en&s;ibility which &s;uch experience on their return.</P>
<P>It is an un&s;peakable mercy to us, that God hath &s;aid, <HI>I will &s;et mine eyes upon them for good;&mdash; I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up. And I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the Lord; and they &s;hall be my people, and I will
<PB N="274" REF="031228_0279_0FEB7696394358F8">
be their God; for they &s;hall return unto me with their whole heart.</HI> Jer. xxiv.6, 7. Tho&s;e eyes pervade our path, and penetrate the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of our hearts; not to pur&s;ue us with de&s;erved judg|ment, but to overcome us with his unbounded mercy! That adored Saviour who hath purcha&s;|ed his people with his mo&s;t precious blood, <HI>devi&s;eth means that his bani&s;hed people be not expelled from him.</HI> 2 Sam. xiv.14. The&s;e means are wi&s;ely adapted to the end, and never fail to bring the wanderer home with tears.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel are commanded to go, and proclaim the&s;e words&mdash;<HI>Return, thou back|&s;liding I&s;rael, &s;aith the Lord; and I will not cau&s;e mine anger to fall upon you, for I am mer|ciful, &s;aith the Lord; and I will not keep anger for ever. Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou ha&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed again&s;t the Lord thy God, and have not obeyed my voice, &s;aith the Lord. Turn, O back&s;liding children, &s;aith the Lord, for I am married unto you.</HI> Jer. iii.12, 13, 14. The &s;oul of di&s;obedient David was brought to a &s;en&s;ibility of its &s;hameful guilt, and awful departure from the Lord, by a me&s;&s;age &s;ent by Nathan the prophet&mdash;<HI>Thou art the man.</HI> 2 Sam. xii.7. Mi|ni&s;ters are faithfully to declare unto revolting pro|fe&s;&s;ors, that <HI>their own wickedne&s;s &s;hall correct
<PB N="275" REF="031228_0280_0FEB769B021F0F70">
them, and their own back&s;lidings &s;hall reprove them</HI>;&mdash;that &s;uch &s;hould deeply <HI>know, and &s;ee, that it is an evil thing, and a bitter, that they have for&s;aken the Lord their God, and that his fear is not in them, &s;aith the Lord God of Ho&s;ts.</HI> Jer. ii.19. By &s;o doing God often conveys an arrow of conviction to the heart, opens its guilt, produces repentance, and re&s;tores the back&s;lider to the &s;en&s;i|ble enjoyment of his &s;miles.</P>
<P>Affliction is another mean by which the wan|derer is frequently re&s;tored. <HI>If his children for|&s;ake my law, and walk not in my judgment; if they break my &s;tatutes, and keep not my command|ments, then will I vi&s;it their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions with the rod, and their iniquities with &s;tripes. Ne|verthele&s;s, my loving kindne&s;s will I not utterly take from him, nor &s;uffer my faithfulne&s;s to fail.</HI> P&s;a. lxxxix.3. God hath many rods; and al|though they be held in a Father's hands, and honey be at the end of every twig, yet they are calculated to make the di&s;obedient feel. According to the complexion of the mind, the wanderings of the heart, and the errors of the life, will be the &s;e|verity of the cha&s;ti&s;ement; <HI>the fruit of all is to take away &s;in.</HI> I&s;a. xxvii.9. God's dealing with I&s;rael, recorded in the &s;econd and thirteenth chap|ters of Ho&s;ea, &s;hould be &s;olemn warnings to a re|volting

chri&s;tian. Although in the mid&s;t of pro&s;|perity, and reclining upon the lap of ea&s;e, God can, by a variety of providences, and by unexpected means, <HI>hedge up your way with thorns,</HI> and <HI>make a wall,</HI> that you &s;hould not <HI>find your path. God's furnace is in Zion, and his fire in Jeru&s;alem.</HI> I&s;a. xxxi.9. purpo&s;ely to try and refine his own people from their dro&s;s. Remember, it is not any <HI>fire,</HI> any <HI>furnace,</HI> nor any <HI>affliction,</HI> that will an|&s;wer the purpo&s;e of reclaiming a back&s;lider; but it is God's fire, which he kindles in faithfulne&s;s, love, and mercy; and which will, &s;ooner or later, humble the proud heart, and bring the tran&s;gre&s;&s;or to the Lord. Afflictions in them&s;elves do but irri|tate, harden, and produce rebellion; but God's cha&s;ti&s;ement &s;hall heal as well as wound; for, &s;aith the Lord concerning the revolting chri&s;tian, <HI>I have &s;een his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him al&s;o, and re&s;tore comforts unto him, and to his mourners.</HI> I&s;a. lviii.18. For this very purpo&s;e Chri&s;t <HI>&s;its as a refiner and purifier of &s;ilver; and he &s;hall purify the &s;ons of Levi, and purge them as gold and &s;ilver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Mal. iii.3. Remember he &s;its to watch the gold in the furnace, and to regulate the heat. In proportion to the &s;tate of the mind &s;hall be the &s;everity of the fire of af|fliction;
<PB N="277" REF="031228_0282_0FEAF870C01B3CA8">
and Chri&s;t frequently employs &s;atan, wick|ed men, and hypocrites, &s;killful to afflict, to bring <HI>fuel</HI> to the furnace. Ah, Chri&s;tian! &s;ooner than your heart &s;hall remain in a cold, &s;tupid, prayerle&s;s, di&s;obedient &s;tate, the furnace &s;hall be made &s;even times hotter than it was wont to be made. Your being a &s;ubject of redeeming grace does not &s;creen you from &s;uffering, nor gives you indulgence in &s;in|ful &s;loth; but, on the contrary, God will not &s;uffer you long to remain in this &s;tate: for, whom the Lord loveth he cha&s;teneth, and &s;courgeth every &s;on whom he receiveth; and tho&s;e who are practically acquainted with a life of faith, know, that as &s;ure as they revolt from God in the frame of their hearts, and in the duties of the go&s;pel, an affliction of &s;ome &s;ort awaits them, to convince them of their folly.&mdash; The Prodigal left his father with apparent &s;atisfac|tion; but a famine was produced, and brought him back again, weeping, to his father's arms.</P>
<P>Sometimes the very object, means, or temptation by which a per&s;on was induced to revolt from God, is, by an over-ruling providence, made the means of re&s;toration. The very idols which may have engro&s;&s;ed your affections and decoyed your feet a&s;tray, &s;hall either be da&s;hed in pieces before your eyes, or they &s;hall be &s;uffered to remain as thorns in your &s;ides, and &s;pears in your heart, to convince you
<PB N="278" REF="031228_0283_0FEB76A1552F0110">
of your folly in departing from the Lord. Spiritual idolatry is one of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t &s;ins, and never fails to lead the mind into ten thou&s;and evils, before we are aware. God is a jealous God over the people loves; he will not &s;uffer a rival to remain long in their hearts; and he will ca&s;t them out, and make us mourn with bitterne&s;s for our folly. David loved Ab&s;olam inordinately, therefore Ab&s;olam &s;hall u&s;urp his father's throne, and prove an arrow in his father's heart. Solomon knew, by his own bitter experi|ence, that, <HI>the back&s;lider in heart &s;hall be filled with his own ways.</HI> Prov. xiv.14. God can &s;ufficiently puni&s;h his own di&s;obedient children with|out &s;ending them to hell; for he can &s;end an <HI>hell</HI> into them;&mdash;he can open the great deep of their own hard hearts; bring them to a recollection of their conduct; &s;hew them the aggravations of their &s;in, and make them loath them&s;elves for their abo|minations again&s;t him. They are thus filled with remor&s;e; they ari&s;e in indignation again&s;t them&s;elves; their wounds gape wide; and they feel the need of a phy&s;ician's balm. Repentance flows from a broken heart, and faith again ventures upon the promi&s;e. <HI>He will turn again: He will have compa&s;&s;ion upon us. Thou wilt &s;ubdue our iniquities, and thou wilt ca&s;t all their &s;ins into the depths of the &s;ea.</HI> Mic. vii.19. From this per&s;ua&s;ion the &s;oul
<PB N="279" REF="031228_0284_0FEB76A7BA6F3A80">
returns again by prayer; finds God faithful to his promi&s;e, and receives the pledges of redeeming love.</P>
<P>It is not unu&s;ual with God to re&s;tore his wan|dering people, by the &s;ecret communication of HIM|SELF, without the u&s;e of any vi&s;ible means. <HI>The Lord turned, and looked upon Peter.</HI> Luke xxii.61. It was enough; his heart di&s;&s;olved; he remembered his &s;in;&mdash;a&s;hamed and confounded, he retired, and wept. When the SUN OF RIGHTEOUSNESS ari&s;es upon the wanderer's mind, tho&s;e &s;ins which were committed with little conviction, now keenly im|pre&s;s the heart.&mdash;He feels the darkne&s;s of his mind; regrets his extreme di&s;tance from the sen&s;ible pre|&s;ence of the Lord, and adopts the language of David &mdash;<HI>Ca&s;t me not away from thy pre&s;ence; and take not thy</HI> HOLY SPIRIT <HI>from me. Re&s;tore unto me the joy of thy &s;alvation, and uphold me with thy free &s;pirit.</HI> P&s;. li.11, 12. God &s;ecretly ex|po&s;tulates with the &s;oul,&mdash;<HI>O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? te&s;tify again&s;t me?</HI> Mic. vi.3. All the tender feelings of the &s;oul are awakened; he ap|proaches the Lord, who &s;ecretly whi&s;pers peace, &s;heds abroad his love within the heart, and fixes its &s;tanding more &s;ecure than it was before it fell.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;ibility of a reclaimed Chri&s;tian is ex|tremely great. His &s;oul abhors the &s;ins, and &s;hud|ders
<PB N="280" REF="031228_0285_0FEB76AAE8A13EC0">
at the path which led his feet a&s;tray;&mdash;he deep|ly laments his di&s;tance from God, and the &s;piritual decay which &s;uch perfidious conduct has produced in his &s;oul. He no longer triumphs over the im|perfections and mi&s;carriages of others, but culti|vates towards them the mo&s;t tender compa&s;&s;ion. He now proves the &s;overeignty of grace, and the preciou&s;ne&s;s of God's love, that pre&s;erved his &s;oul from hell, and brought him back with joy. He no longer tru&s;ts the attainments of his mind, nor the feelings of his heart; but puts his tru&s;t alone in the protection of the Almighty. His views of Chri&s;t are more brilliant; his faith in him is more firm; and his love towards him is more ardent. It is impo&s;&s;ible fully to de&s;cribe the fine feelings of &s;uch a man's &s;oul. Sufficient to &s;ay, it is the work of God, and worthy its Almighty Author. We learn from it, that God hates &s;in e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en in his own people; and in their re&s;toration, he makes them feel its bitterne&s;s before he gladdens their hearts with his &s;miles.
