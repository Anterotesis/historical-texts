<HEAD>Thoughts concerning <HI>THE BANK OF NORTH AMERICA,</HI> with &s;ome facts relating to &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hments in other countries, re&s;pectfully &s;ubmitted to the honorable <HI>THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF PENNSYLVANIA,</HI> by one of their Con&s;tituents.</HEAD>
<P>THE debates and publications, concerning the Bank of North Ame|rica, have already been &s;o numerous and extended, that, were the &s;ubject of le&s;s importance further inve&s;tigation would be an inexcu&s;ea|ble tre&s;pa&s;s on the public time. But as the&s;e in&s;titutions were generally unknown among us before the revolution, and as they are univer&s;ally admitted to be objects of the fir&s;t con&s;equence, it is confided, that a de|cent endeavour to bring before the government and people of Penn&s;yl|vania &s;ome matters connected with the &s;ubject, which are not yet &s;uffi|ciently known and under&s;tood, will be favored with an indulgent recep|tion. As it will be &s;een that the writer of the&s;e reflexions has departed from the line, which tho&s;e who are charged with party friend&s;hip or en|mity have cho&s;en to pur&s;ue, he tru&s;ts it will be believed that it is only intended re&s;pectfully to attempt to contribute as far as may be in his power to that information, which will be nece&s;&s;ary to enable the legi&s;la|ture to place the bank upon &s;o prudent and ju&s;t a footing as to preclude hereafter all rea&s;onable di&s;contentment,</P>
<P>The exi&s;tence of public banks in mo&s;t trading countries and e&s;peci|ally in two of the mo&s;t commercial and opulent nations of Europe, who&s;e con&s;titutions are as favorable to liberty as any but tho&s;e of Ame|rica; the great majority of wi&s;e and hone&s;t &s;tate&s;men, who have ap|proved of them from experience, and the benefits, which it has been proved, may be rea&s;onably expected from one here, with many other rea&s;ons not nece&s;&s;ary to be repealed at this time, appear to have convin|ced the greater part of the community, that a bank, wi&s;ely and ju&s;tly con&s;tituted, would be a public good. How much &s;oever, therefore, it might be argued, from the practice of legi&s;latures, and the nature of free governments, that the A&s;&s;embly of Penn&s;ylvania did po&s;&s;e&s;s the power to re&s;train and terminate the bank, it appears, that it would have been mo&s;t advi&s;eable to regulate rather than to de&s;troy it. The minds of many in the two parties were manife&s;tly heated, and to &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed with certain ideas, to which they were re&s;pectively attached, and thus we &s;ee one &s;ide determined to annul, and the other not to mo|dify. A repetition of the&s;e contentions is much to be deprecated. They are the bane of happine&s;s at home, and credit abroad. The precau|tions, re&s;trictions and regulations, which may be pre&s;cribed by the pre|&s;ent legi&s;lature in the charter about to be granted, will prevent them, it is believed, in a great degree hereafter.</P>
<P>Though a part of the oppo&s;ition to the bank of North America may have ari&s;en from party &s;pirit, "a con&s;equential ill which freedom draws," yet an examination into the foundations of other in&s;titutions of the &s;ame kind, and a candid and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate con&s;ideration of the con&s;titution of that bank will convince us, that the nece&s;&s;ities and na|ture of the times and the perfect novelty of the bu&s;ine&s;s occa&s;ioned &s;e|veral extreme dangers to be overlooked in its formation.</P>
<P>BANKS had their origin in the Italian &s;tates, who&s;e people have long been di&s;tingui&s;hed for their &s;cience in political oeconomy. They
<PB N="2" REF="020307_0002_0FAE99F372239A10">
appear, in mo&s;t of the great ca&s;es, to have ari&s;en out of national di|&s;tre&s;s. The funding of the public debts has generally given them birth, and we find their exi&s;tence has often been originally re&s;tricted to the period when the public debt &s;hould be di&s;charged. One of the olde&s;t of the&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments was that of Genoa. Being too little re|&s;trained in regard to the emi&s;&s;ion of paper&punc; and incautiou&s;ly taking a part in the politics of Europe, this bank &s;oon involved it&s;elf in ruin. The injuries to public credit, and the melancholy interruptions of pri|vate happine&s;s re&s;ulting from &s;o lamentable a cata&s;trophe need not be repeated. From &s;uch confu&s;ion and di&s;tre&s;s it behoves the guardians of the people carefully to &s;ecure them.</P>
<P>The bank of Venice, which aro&s;e &s;ome time after, was placed im|mediately in the hands of the &s;tate, and the republic was &s;ecurity for its conduct. It were to be wi&s;hed that public credit were &s;o far re&s;tor|ed among&s;t us as to render it prudent to put our bank on &s;uch a foot|ing The great litigated que&s;tion concerning the want of checks in our &s;tate con&s;titution, makes it advi&s;eable at lea&s;t at pre&s;ent rather to pur&s;ue &s;ome other mode: and were our public credit as perfect, at it is pre&s;umed it will be in a few years, it might not be proper to place the bank immediately in the hands of a government, who&s;e form it&s;elf de|clares it to be only a &s;even years experiment</P>
<P>The bank of Hamburg pre&s;ents its citizens and the government of the city, which is imperial, as &s;ecurities to all who deal with it. The directors are cho&s;en, like other officers of their government, by a majo|rity of the freemens' votes, out of the number of their mo&s;t re&s;pectable citizens. <HI>Foreigners are not permitted to be intere&s;ted in it, lea&s;t the wealth, power, or ambition of their neighbours might interrupt their repo&s;e, or &s;ap the foundations of their government.</HI> Though the u&s;e of the money of foreigners appears to be a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for permit|ting them to be intere&s;ted in our banks in this young country, yet a mo&s;t important que&s;tion is naturally &s;ugge&s;ted by the prudence of the Hamburgers, <HI>whether they ought to have a &s;hare in the government of tho&s;e in&s;titutions.</HI> For, however re&s;pectable Penn&s;ylvania finds her&s;elf in the American union, it is an incon&s;iderable &s;tate, as to numbers or wealth, compared with &s;everal of the nations of Europe; and the faci|lities of commerce bring Philadelphia as near to Paris, London, or Am&s;terdam, as Hamburg to Vienna or Berlin.</P>
<P>The banks of Holland, that is tho&s;e of Am&s;terdam and Rotterdam, are immediately in the hands and under the direction of the re|gency of their re&s;pective cities, who are &s;ecurities for their faithful and prudent admini&s;tration, by which foreigners are of cour&s;e, excluded from the management They do not i&s;&s;ue any notes; and the opera|tions in general of the&s;e banks, are not of a nature to be very u&s;eful in &s;uch a country as this. Their caution as to foreigners however will de&s;erve our attention, for the rea&s;ons &s;tated under the foregoing head.</P>
<P>The bank of England is better worth our attention, than any which has ever exi&s;ted&punc; whether we con&s;ider it with regard to the prodigious aids it has afforded to the government, or its u&s;efulne&s;s to the commer|cial and manufacturing intere&s;ts and, through the&s;e, to the cultivators of the &s;oil. In the reign of William III. that in&s;titution was produ|ced by the apprehen&s;ions of the nation for their public credit. It was a moment of as great danger and nece&s;&s;ity as that wherein the bank of North America was e&s;tabli&s;hed. The celebrated Bolingbroke declares,
<PB N="3" REF="020307_0003_0FAE99F666232730">
that the revenues of the nation, which could be applied to carry on the war, (which was at once civil and foreign,) were at that time in&s;uffi|cient to pay a common guard. At this period too, when their affairs were in that mi&s;erable &s;ituation, James II. &s;upported by great num|bers of the people of Britain and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the mo&s;t powerful na|tion in Europe, with a &s;agacious and enterpri&s;ing prince at their head, was a&s;&s;erting his claim to the crown. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">t that awful cri&s;is when ne|ce&s;&s;ity would have palliated almo&s;t any over&s;ights, it is as plea&s;ing as it is curious, to ob&s;erve the deliberation caution and wi&s;dom of the parlia|ment, in making their fir&s;t experiment of a national bank. A &s;hort detail will in&s;truct and &s;erve us in our pre&s;ent &s;ituation, when we are about to organize a &s;imilar in&s;titution, under no circum&s;tance of imme|diate danger, or momentuous difficulty.</P>
<P>They previou&s;ly re&s;trained the king, who could grant any charter, not a monopoly, from making this corporation, of an unlimited or ex|ce&s;&s;ive duration, by confining him to eleven years This omi&s;&s;ion in our A&s;&s;embly having been very judiciou&s;ly and candidly pointed out by the committee of the pre&s;ent Hou&s;e, the contentions which have ari&s;en from it will &s;ub&s;ide of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>They al&s;o re&s;trained the king from granting a charter, which ad|mitted too powerful a capital. Though the revenues of the kingdom were two millions of pounds &s;terling, exclu&s;ively of the land tax in that highly improved country, it was limited to twelve hundred thou|&s;and pounds. If we make an accurate compari&s;on of wealth, numbers, and trade, between the two countries, we &s;hall concur again with the committee of the pre&s;ent hou&s;e, in thinking that the capital permitted by the charter was in effect unlimited. The feeds of danger contained in this article are not yet ripened. Had the matter continued as at fir&s;t, it would have been difficult to remove the evil, when it &s;hould have been felt. It is not ea&s;y to overcome the influence of &s;uch mighty wealth.</P>
<P>They re&s;trained the bank from contracting debts as a corporation, for more than the amount of their capital; an hone&s;t and judicious re|&s;triction; and they enacted, that the private fortunes of the &s;tockhold|ers &s;hould be liable to make good all &s;uch debts as were beyond the a|mount of their capital, or in other words, beyond the amount of what they were worth as a corporation. It has been truly affirmed, that it is highly dangerous in any government to i&s;&s;ue bills of credit, but upon certain and &s;ub&s;tantial funds. The wi&s;dom of the legi&s;lature will find the &s;ame danger in con&s;tituting a corporation with power to i&s;&s;ue with|out controul, notes (or bills of credit) for &s;ums beyond what they are able to pay, in ca&s;e of the ruin of the in&s;titution. The banks of Paris, Genoa, and other places afford melancholy in&s;tances of the po&s;|&s;ibility of the&s;e fatal events. The public happine&s;s and common ju&s;tice, which require that no man &s;hould be empowered to ruin his neighbour while he is &s;afe, will recommend this article to the particular attention of government.</P>
<P>They guarded again&s;t unlimited votes being in the hands of one man&punc; or &s;et of men, by giving each proprietor of five hundred pounds a vote, and by not permitting any man to have more. How incautious was our charter, when it allowed every man to have as many votes as he holds &s;hares. Let us examine this important article. It is urged that every per&s;on &s;hould have an influence, according to what he has at
<PB N="4" REF="020307_0004_0FAE99F7E942D9D8">
&s;take. But mere property is not the mea&s;ure of fitne&s;s in the&s;e ca&s;es. The free but wary &s;pirit of that time rejected that idea, and, it is be|lieved, that it is equally di&s;approved now. It does not agree with the nature of any government, wherein there is a principle of liberty. It is ab&s;olutely oppo&s;ed to the &s;pirit of every con&s;titution in the union. The great corporations in England, &s;uch as the bank, who&s;e &s;tock is now above eleven millions &s;terling, the Ea&s;t-India Company, which is immen&s;ely rich, and powerful in &s;everal ways, and indeed all others that we know of, are founded in oppo&s;ite principles. We alone, the members of a free and equal government, have endowed a wealthy cor|poration with powers and privileges oppo&s;ed to freedom and equality, and to all examples among our&s;elves and in other nations. The bank of Paris, e&s;tabli&s;hed under an ab&s;olute monarchy, was founded in a &s;mall degree in the &s;ame mi&s;take, but it went to ruin, mi&s;erably di&s;tracted the nation, and annihilated the public credit. Our habits in private bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence, oppo&s;e this regulation. It mu&s;t have crept in from want of attention in the founders of the in&s;titution, and it is confided, that they will not on con&s;ideration urge its continuance. When mercantile hou&s;es are e&s;tabli&s;hed, many of which in Europe con|tinue longer than the limitation of the bank of North America will pro|bably be extended, and &s;ome of which are more wealthy than our bank, no article of this nature is ever entered into Young men, with little property, are often joined to per&s;ons of great e&s;tates and exten&s;ive con|nections, and have the entire management of the bu&s;ine&s;s. In ca&s;es where three are connected, we find no &s;tipulation, that the riche&s;t partner &s;hall govern. Since then it is, and has been an almo&s;t invari|able fact, that corporations in&s;tituted for purpo&s;es of religion, policy or gain, have been founded in principles of equality, let us be careful how we depart from a practice out of which no evil has re&s;ulted, and adopt another from which dangers are apprehended and indeed are evi|dent, di&s;contents have ari&s;en, and which is oppo&s;ed by the experience of all former times and the prudence of the wi&s;e&s;t nations.</P>
<P>We &s;ee that the regencies of Venice, Hamburg, Rotterdam and Am|&s;terdam, have not permitted the influences ari&s;ing from the&s;e in&s;titu|tions to be in the hands even of their private citizens. They have con&s;idered them as branches of political oeconomy, &s;o interwoven with the &s;afety and admini&s;tration of government, that they have kept them in their own hands. The&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions are not novelties. They have occurred before. The friends of the bank of England brought them forward in the infancy of that corporation, and admitting the po&s;&s;ibility of influence&punc; they urged that their in&s;titution could not be dangerous to the people on account of the equality of its con&s;titution. A publication, written by Michael Godfrey&punc; e&s;quire, one of the founders of the En|gli&s;h bank, to remove the fears of the people about the commercial and political advantages, which the gentlemen who ruled it might derive in con&s;equence, tells the nation, that "though it cannot be imagin|ed, but that tho&s;e, who e&s;tabli&s;hed the bank, intended to be largely concerned, yet it is &s;o &s;ettled, that tho&s;e who have but five hundred pounds, have one vote, and tho&s;e who have never &s;o much can have no more; and any nine members having each five hundred pounds &s;tock, may call a general court, (or meeting) and turn out the gov|ernor and deputy governor and all or any of the directors, (but by a majority of the &s;tock holders votes in cour&s;e) and choo&s;e others in their
<PB N="5" REF="020307_0005_0FAE99F7FAEE6D00">
places; which are provi&s;ions &s;o wi&s;e and effectual to prevent fraud in &s;ome to the prejudice of the re&s;t, that it hardly leaves room for any doubt of that nature." It appears however that the parliament was &s;till apprehen&s;ive of &s;ome di&s;advantages from &s;o momentous and untri|ed a bu&s;ine&s;s, and therefore, a few years after, and before the expi|ration of the eleven years grant, re&s;trained one third of the twenty-four directors of every year from &s;erving for the next, though the gov|ernor and deputy governor might always be re-elected, for the &s;ake of keeping up the train of information nece&s;&s;ary in &s;o important and exten&s;ive a &s;cene of bu&s;ine&s;s, both public and private. Though the di&s;|cretion and candour of the members of our bank led them to reduce the unlimited right of voting for directors to twenty, &s;o that &s;till &s;ome have one and &s;ome have twenty votes in the bu&s;ine&s;s of elections, this is very different from the footing on which the precedents of all other nations and corporations, appear to recommend its being placed. By the original con&s;titution of the bank of North-America, the right of voting for all purpo&s;es, but the election of directors, was equal in all the members, notwith&s;tanding any inequality in the numbers of their re&s;pective &s;hares. This regulation was done away by general con&s;ent, apparently without due con&s;ideration, and has made a very material al|teration in the in&s;titution, rendering it &s;till more unlike all other banks, &s;till more un&s;afe than it was at fir&s;t. Great mi&s;takes have a|ri&s;en on this &s;ubject from con&s;idering the bank as a mere trading com|pany. Though it is in a great degree of that nature, it is mo&s;t an ob|ject of legi&s;lative attention as a branch of the political oeconomy, im|portant in its magnitude and in its operations and effects. All writers have viewed the &s;ubject in that light, and facts &s;hew their ideas to be ju&s;t. Incorporated banks, as before ob&s;erved, aro&s;e from the public occa&s;ions, and have been in&s;tituted to an&s;wer public ends. Private men and private property have been u&s;ed as the means, as mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be the ca&s;e in all the arrangements of civil &s;ociety. The bank of North-America is it&s;elf an happy example. It was e&s;tabli&s;hed to ena|ble government to pro&s;ecute the war again&s;t Britain, and had a great &s;hare in the merit of completing the revolution. It has been propo&s;ed &s;ince the peace to centre in it the funds of the &s;tate; and its capital is worth more than the amount of all the annual impo&s;ts exci&s;e, land tax, and other revenues of Penn&s;ylvania &s;ummed up together It is a mighty machine, and by its pre&s;ent con&s;titution all its powers are ve&s;t|ed in a few hands. Were it not for great public purpo&s;es, a number of private banks with moderate capitals, would perhaps be as u&s;eful. There are no le&s;s than fifty-one of them in the city of London, the a|mount of who&s;e capitals mu&s;t be greater than that of the bank of En|gland. The&s;e form an excellent and powerful check, which, from the &s;ituation of this country, we may be long without. The Engli&s;h legi&s;lature have given an unequivocal proof of their viewing the direc|tion of the bank in the light of a public employment, for they required by their act that the directors &s;hould be regularly &s;worn into office, and permitted them to &s;erve in parliament by a &s;pecial di&s;pen&s;ation, which on account of the &s;tatute again&s;t placemen, it was thought they could not otherwi&s;e have done.</P>
<P>We moreover &s;ee, that the parliament of England re&s;trained any per|&s;on from &s;ub&s;cribing more than twenty thou&s;and pounds, that is, the &s;ix|tieth part of the allowed capital, and for a certain time did not permit
<PB N="6" REF="020307_0006_0FAE99F8DD6B8A38">
more than ten thou&s;and pounds, or the one hundred and twentieth part, to be &s;ub&s;cribed. The entire &s;um being taken before that period the re|&s;triction operated to prevent any per&s;on from holding more than the one hundred and twentieth part of the whole &s;tock. Our bank &s;tock is 870,000 dollars, and there are &s;everal &s;tockholders that hold from 100 to 130 &s;hares; &s;o that &s;ome individuals hold a twenty-&s;econd part, and &s;ome even a &s;eventeenth part of its capital</P>
<P>The bank of England was likewi&s;e re&s;trained from trading in any thing, but bills of exchange or bullion, but the ch<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ter from the a&s;&s;em|bly of Penn&s;ylvania did not prohibit a trade in any thing whatever.</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;criptions to the bank of England were to be taken by no per&s;ons whatever, but certain commi&s;&s;ioners appointed by the crown under the authority of the parliament, to whom a return was to be made of all per&s;ons, whether natives or foreigners, and of all bodies politic and corporate, which &s;hould &s;ub&s;cribe any part of the &s;tock, that the government might know all things, which the &s;ecrecy or de|licacy, nece&s;&s;ary in regard to private affairs, did not make it proper to re&s;erve This was very u&s;eful, in order to be forewarned in due time of the dangers, which might ari&s;e from too large &s;ub&s;criptions of the wealthy corporations and of foreigners, or from any other cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The parliament of England granted its charter for eleven years: ours, as above ob&s;erved, was in effect unlimited. The la&s;t regulation which will be mentioned is very important&mdash;It is that whereby the parliament provided that all future elections of governors, deputy go|vernors and directors &s;hould be made by a majority of the members actually a&s;&s;embled. By the operation of this rule, the management of the bank was completely and not indelicately kept out of the hands of foreigners, who would &s;eldom be there, but who might be if they cho&s;e. The mo&s;t re&s;pectable natural born &s;ubject and the foreigner, in ca&s;e of ab&s;ence, were equally prevented from voting by proxy. The dangers ari&s;ing from foreigners having a &s;hare in the direction of &s;o important a part of the internal oeconomy of the &s;tate are too obvious to require any arguments. As they confide to us the large&s;t &s;ums by way of con&s;ignment, and employ us otherwi&s;e in the mo&s;t important agen|cies, &s;o it is not to be doubted that they will acquie&s;ce in a regulation from us, which they meet every where in Europe. The government of England alone gives them opportunity of voting, if they chu&s;e to at|tend, but tho&s;e of Am&s;terdam Rotterdam, Hamburg, Venice and of all other places and countries, of which we know, either prevent their even holding a &s;hare of the &s;tock, or re&s;train them from voting for tho&s;e who are to govern an in&s;titution, which may be con&s;idered as the re&s;ervoir of the vital blood of their civil con&s;titutions.</P>
<P>This paper has already been extended to a greater length than it was originally propo&s;ed. Wherefore, though a few more ob&s;ervations oc|cur, which appear of &s;ome weight, they will be at pre&s;ent omitted. What has been &s;aid, is &s;ubmitted with the mo&s;t re&s;pectful deference, to the wi&s;dom and virtue of our repre&s;entatives, in full confidence, that from their hands we &s;hall receive nothing which can give occa&s;ion to di&s;turb the public tranquility, or abridge the rights of the people.</P>

<HEAD>Further Thoughts concerning the <HI>BANK,</HI> re&s;pectfully &s;ubmitted to the Honorable <HI>THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF PENNSYLVANIA,</HI> by one of their Con&s;tituents.</HEAD>
<P>IN the clo&s;e of the former publication, it was mentioned, that al|though a few more ob&s;ervations, apparently of &s;ome weight, had oc|curred at that time, it &s;eemed be&s;t to defer them. It is intended to of|fer them in this paper, with &s;ome other things, which have pre&s;ented &s;ince.</P>
<P>The approbation of the principles contained in that e&s;&s;ay, which &s;e|veral judicious and worthy men have expre&s;&s;ed, have a tendency to &s;trengthen the opinions, that a bank, wi&s;ely and ju&s;tly con&s;tituted, would be a public good&mdash;that it would have been beneficial to Penn&s;ylvania, if the late honorable Hou&s;e had determined to regulate rather than de|&s;troy the in&s;titution&mdash;and that good men of all de&s;criptions and parties will think <HI>them&s;elves and their property</HI> perfectly &s;ecure, if the wi&s;dom of the pre&s;ent Hou&s;e &s;hould adopt a plan for our bank &s;ub&s;tantially the &s;ame as that of the bank of England It will however be proper to mention, that there are two more regulations of the bank of England, hitherto unnoticed, which are of con&s;equence to the prudent and fair admini&s;tration of its affairs. The fir&s;t requires, that a director &s;hall be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of four &s;hares of &s;tock, and the governor and deputy gover|nor of more The other prevents any per&s;on from voting as a &s;tock|holder, if he has not held his &s;hares &s;ix months.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who approve the&s;e general ideas on this intere&s;ting &s;ubject, mu&s;t feel an earne&s;t de&s;ire to remove any improper opinions and im|pre&s;&s;ions, which may prevent a harmony of mea&s;ures. One great cir|cum&s;tance, which has embittered this conte&s;t, is an idea prevailing a|mong many, that the interference of the legi&s;lature in the bu&s;ine&s;s of exi&s;ting corporations is totally unprecedented, and unwarrantable. I acknowledge my&s;elf to have formerly entertained this idea, and there|fore think it the more my duty to &s;ay &s;omething to remove an error which I have a&s;&s;i&s;ted, in whatever degree, to promote. If we can &s;hew that this opinion, however &s;incerely entertained by many &s;en&s;ible and hone&s;t men, is <HI>really erroneous,</HI> it mu&s;t produce the happie&s;t ef|fects in every candid and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate mind. Let us remember how|ever, that although it &s;hould be proved from legi&s;lative practice and the nature of free governments, that the a&s;&s;embly did po&s;&s;e&s;s the power to re&s;train and terminate the bank, we &s;hall continue at liberty to believe, that it might have been mo&s;t advi&s;eable to regulate rather than to de|&s;troy it.</P>
<P>As the origin of corporations in Great-Britain has been already &s;hewn in the debates and publications concerning the bank, we may pa&s;s on from that point after a &s;ingle ob&s;ervation, which may keep in our minds, the principles and cau&s;es from which they took their ri&s;e. <HI>They were actually devi&s;ed to re&s;tore to tho&s;e, who were, and tho&s;e who &s;hould become members, their equal natural rights, and not to de&s;troy them.</HI> We cannot therefore apprehend, that the guardians of our equal rights forgetting the generous and wi&s;e de&s;ign of the&s;e in&s;titutions, and the practice of all other nations, will repeat the deviation from a fundamen|tal principle of our free government, by reviving the charter of the bank in its original form.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="020307_0008_0FAE99FA58B247E8">An in&s;pection into the hi&s;tory of bodies corporate in Britain, will &s;hew us the powers actually exerci&s;ed by parliament to extingui&s;h and re&s;train them.</P>
<P>In the reign of James I. we find that the people of England had be|come extremely di&s;&s;atisfied with the very numerous charters and letters patent, which had been granted to particular men and bodies of men, from time to time. The parliament, judging that the public good re|quired their interference, and that it was within their con&s;titutional powers and duties to interpo&s;e, pa&s;&s;ed an act, (21 James I. ch. 3,) the fir&s;t &s;ection of which takes away from all bodies politic or corporate what&s;oever, the various monopolies to which they were entitled by their re&s;pective charters. It then proceeds to &s;ave to certain corporations, a continuance of the rights and privileges, which they had before the pa&s;&s;ing of that act, and of which &s;uch corporations would have been de|prived, if the &s;aving clau&s;e had been omitted. This &s;tatute appears to have originated with the Hou&s;e of Commons.</P>
<P>On the re&s;toration of Charles II. to the throne of England, it was again thought, though for a different rea&s;on (the confu&s;ion of tho&s;e times) that the interference of parliament in the&s;e matters was proper and ne|ce&s;&s;ary. We therefore &s;ee that they pa&s;&s;ed an act (13 Charles II. &s;t. 2 c. 1.) entitled <HI>an act for the well governing and regulating of corpora|tions.</HI> By this &s;tatute, officers of all corporations, who &s;hould omit or refu&s;e to qualify them&s;elves by a day therein mentioned, were to be removed from their offices by commi&s;&s;ioners to be appointed under the authority of the legi&s;lature, and their places were to be filled by &s;uch per&s;ons as the commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould chu&s;e, although they might have been duly elected in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and the charters generally re|quired that all officers &s;hould be elected by the members of the re&s;pec|tive corporations: and further, the commi&s;&s;ioners were empowered to remove from offices, places and tru&s;ts in corporations, all &s;uch as in their opinions, the public &s;afety &s;hould require to be removed, although &s;uch per&s;ons were intere&s;ted in the &s;tock, and had duly qualified them|&s;elves, or &s;hould offer &s;o to do.</P>
<P>In the 4th or 5th year of William and Mary, a new charter was granted to the Ea&s;t-India Company, with the exclu&s;ive privilege of trading in and to tho&s;e countries, which they had enjoyed for a very long time. It was to continue for twenty years, that is till the year 1715. We find however, that the parliament again judged them&s;elves authorized to interfere in the bu&s;ine&s;s of corporations, for by an act pa&s;&s;ed in 1698, &s;eventeen years before the exclu&s;ive privilege expired, they erected another Ea&s;t-India Company, and prohibited that which was chartered for the exclu&s;ive trade in 1694, from trading at all in 1701.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e of the South Sea Company affords us a remarkable in&s;tance of the interference of the parliament in the regulation of corporations. That great national bubble called for the attention of every hone&s;t and humane member of the legi&s;lature, and gave ri&s;e to many &s;tatutes. One of the acts (7th George I. c. 2) re&s;trained the three corporations (the bank, the Ea&s;t-India Company and the South Sea Company) from re-electing the &s;ub and deputy governors and directors of the South Sea Company of that time into any office, place or employment in tho&s;e in|&s;titutions, although by their re&s;pective charters it might have been done before. It al&s;o re&s;trained the &s;ame per&s;ons from exerci&s;ing their right
<PB N="13" REF="020307_0009_0FAE99FAF8AEE8F8" MS="y">
of voting at the elections of the South Sea Company, although they were of cour&s;e &s;tock-holders and members of the corporation. Some time after, the South Sea company differed among them&s;elves about the divi|&s;ion of a part of their funds. Then again the parliament exerci&s;ed their right to interfere and by their act (7 George I. &s;t. 2) made the nece&s;|&s;ary di&s;tribution. There are &s;everal other in&s;tances of parliamentary interpo&s;ition, but a further detail might be tedious, and the&s;e may be &s;ufficient to remove the mi&s;conceptions that have taken place. Though we mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of the delicate nature of this power of the legi&s;la|ture, and though we mu&s;t exceedingly condemn a wanton or even an incon&s;iderate exerci&s;e of it, yet it is nece&s;&s;ary to make great allowances for tho&s;e, who tran&s;ported by the jealous but hone&s;t &s;pirit of republic|ans, and alarmed by the extreme dangers exi&s;ting on its con&s;titution, thought there was no &s;afety, but in withdrawing the charter of the bank So far, however, as the mea&s;ure proceeded from the mere &s;pi|rit of party, all good men will join to reprobate it. Perhaps, in order to form a ju&s;t opinion on the &s;ubject, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to compare the conduct of the hou&s;e that granted this unprecedented charter, with that of the hou&s;e, who took it away. The various errors of human nature are a &s;ort of apology for each other.</P>
<P>In e&s;timating the injury, or rather the inju&s;tice done to the bank, by withdrawing the charter, it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to be very careful; for the abolition of its franchi&s;es, &s;o far as they interfered with the peace, liberty or &s;afety of the community, was &s;urely a duty and not a crime. The happine&s;s of the people being the end of all &s;ociety, any thing that interferes with it &s;hould be re&s;trained or prohibited. The <HI>&s;anctity</HI> of charters can therefore mean only, that it is dangerous and wicked to trifle with them, not that they are to remain in their original form in all events, at the expence of the more &s;acred natural rights of man|kind, which, we have &s;een, they were invented to promote. The continual duration of bodies corporate, was to enable them to receive property, and exerci&s;e their re&s;pective functions, as long as the public good might require, or permit</P>
<P>Let us for a moment &s;uppo&s;e a charter in exi&s;t, in which there were extreme <HI>acknowledged</HI> evils. The courts of law could not afford any remedy, becau&s;e they can only take cognizance of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of charters. The legi&s;lature, it is affirmed by &s;ome cannot interfere, and their con&s;tituents, if that doctrine be admitted, mu&s;t fore&s;ee im|pending ruin and meet it without the hope of relief. Can then the temporary repre&s;entatives of a free people erect a corporation within the body of a &s;tate to continue an irremediable evil through all future ages? No: tho&s;e, who have been called for their wi&s;dom and virtue, to di&s;pen&s;e through a &s;ingle year the ble&s;&s;ings of government, can|not have a right to mi&s;apply their tran&s;itory powers to de&s;troy it for ever. Such a doctrine would render our frequent elections vain, and goes to inve&s;t the a&s;&s;embly with powers to legi&s;late in every matter, that can be wrought into a corporation, for all times to come, contrary to the letter and &s;pirit of our con&s;titution, and the peace and dignity of the commonwealth.</P>
<P>In the preceding part of this paper, it was ob&s;erved that the ma|jority of the late hou&s;e &s;hould be judged of, with allowance for the ex|ce&s;s,
<PB N="14" REF="020307_0010_0FAE99FBB92DAE18">
which, it is thought by many, they were led into by the jealous but hone&s;t &s;pirit of republicans. The &s;erious part of the community mu&s;t have recour&s;e to &s;ome &s;uch extraordinary cau&s;e to account for their mea|&s;ures in regard to the penal law relating to the bank. It is the peculiar duty of government to guard the morals of the people from temptations to vices and crimes, e&s;pecially &s;uch as are exten&s;ively injurious to &s;ocie|ty. In the warmth of the moment, matters were left on &s;uch a footing, that the dangerous crimes of forgery, and counterfeiting, to which the wicked are allured by extraordinary profit, may be committed almo&s;t without puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>And now, having before us the examples of other nations, and hav|ing taken a free, though it is hoped a re&s;pectful view of the conduct of our own governors, let us collect into a narrower compa&s;s the re&s;ult of the whole. It appears then, that a former a&s;&s;embly, influenced by wi&s;e and patriotic con&s;iderations, did, from the nature and nece&s;&s;ity of the times and the novelty of the &s;ubject, grant a charter to the bank of North America, differing from all precedents&mdash;that it contained many extreme dangers&mdash;that however, the in&s;titution &s;o con&s;tituted, retained its monopoly, (with all its other privileges) during the time for which the A&s;&s;embly had granted it&mdash;that another A&s;&s;embly, di&s;covering the dangers it contained, determined to de&s;troy it when the public good would, perhaps, have been better con&s;ulted in re&s;training it;&mdash;that how|ever clear it may be that they had a lawful power &s;o to do, it is equally true, that mea&s;ures taken for the public happine&s;s, &s;hould not be carried &s;o far as to produce oppo&s;ite effects:&mdash;that a part of the &s;ame hou&s;e which annulled the charter of the bank, promoted the evil by declining any modification:&mdash;that on a pre&s;umption, that the public intere&s;ts will be &s;erved by a bank, an equality of votes, an exclu&s;ion of foreign proxies, an actual limitation of capital, and of duration, and greater circum&s;pec|tion as to the foundation on which notes (or bank bills of credit) &s;hall be hereafter emitted, &s;eem to be indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary:&mdash;that all the benefits which have been derived from the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing and u&s;eful in&s;titutions of this nature in other countries having been attended with the&s;e cautions regulations, a charter on different principles cannot be de&s;ired from any views of public good, and la&s;tly, that a prudent, wi&s;e and faithful legi&s;lature cannot expect to give &s;atisfaction to a free and intelligent people by an unnece&s;&s;ary departure from all precedent, and from the e&s;&s;ential principles of our republican con&s;titutions.</P>

<P>THE world is a great wilderne&s;s, where mankind have wandered and jo&s;tled one another about from the beginning of the creation. Some have removed by nece&s;&s;ity, and others by choice.
