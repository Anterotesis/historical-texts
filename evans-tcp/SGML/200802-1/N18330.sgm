And as the placing one in this Church hath occa&s;ioned this meeting of the Congregation&mdash;permit me to conclude with offering &s;ome ob&s;ervations and in|&s;tructions naturally ari&s;ing from the Analogy betwixt the Organ of human contrivance and our&s;elves the wonder|ful Organs of God's building.</P>
<P>THE materials of which the various parts both of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Organ and our Bodies, are compo&s;ed, are of the earth; but what gives life to both de&s;cendeth from heaven. When the body of man received the breath of life, that wonder|ful Organ was ready to prai&s;e God, &s;o when the bellows, the lungs of the Organ of man's building, heaves and in hales the air, it may be &s;aid to be alive&mdash;it is ready to obey the &s;inger of him who de&s;ireth it to join with the Congre|gation in prai&s;ing God.&mdash;The Spirit of the Lord giveth it breath&mdash;it &s;oundeth&mdash;<Q>and we hear the &s;ound thereof, but cannot tell whence that &s;ound cometh, nor whither it goeth.</Q>&mdash;How expre&s;&s;ive is this of the operations of that &s;pirit who worketh is the hearts of the regenerate! Do the pipes &s;tand in rows&mdash;does each one know it's own appointed place&mdash;and do they all receive their due pro|portion of air from the common &s;tock? Ju&s;t &s;o, the mem|bers of the body natural, &s;ocial, or chri&s;tian &s;tand in that relation, which they bear to each other and to the whole; none can &s;ay to the other <Q>I have no need of thee,&mdash;for no man liveth to him&s;elf.</Q>&mdash;We are members one of another, and our duty is to pre&s;erve "the unity of the &s;pirit

in the bond of peace," always remembering that, what|ever good thing any man has, he mu&s;t have received it from above.</P>
<P>BUT, alas! expre&s;&s;ive of the humbled condition of our nature, are all the works of man; for all loudly publi&s;h their own imperfection, as well as that of him who made them!&mdash;And are not we hereby admoni&s;hed to &s;eek for perfection from God? and this perfection con&s;i&s;teth in be|ing like unto God, and God, St. John tells us, is Love.</P>
<P>IN tuning the Organ, the proportion of di&s;cord in&s;epa|rable from the &s;cale of Mu&s;ic, is di&s;tributed among the &s;e|veral pipes of the Octave, in order that they may all bear their proportion of this inconveniency&mdash;and con&s;equently produce better harmony, than if the whole error was laid on any one of them. What may we learn from this&mdash;but "to bear one another's burdens"&mdash;<Q>to plea&s;e each man his neighbour, for his good to edification?</Q>&mdash;and thus to fulfil the royal law of concord the companion of Cha|rity.</P>
<P>TO the &s;o general neglect of "mutual forbearance and mutual forgivene&s;s," is owing the great di&s;&s;imilitude be|tween many of our modern chri&s;tians and tho&s;e of ancient times, <Q>when THE MULTITUDE OF THE BELIEVERS WERE OF ONE HEART AND OF ONE MIND.</Q></P>
<P>NOT more apt to go out of tune, and all &s;orts of in&s;tru|ments, from the influences of heat, and cold, of moi&s;ture and drought, and of winds and calms; than are the affec|tions of the human heart, tho&s;e &s;trings or pipes of this Or|gan of God's building from the influences of the various objects which &s;urround them; <Q>the lu&s;t of the eye, the lu&s;t of the fle&s;h, and the pride of life.</Q> How oft do one

<P>WHY need I pur&s;ue the Analogy further? Beholding Brethren, the weakne&s;s of our mortal nature thro' &s;in, in the imperfection in&s;parable from all the works of &s;kill and genius,&mdash;and the dignity of that nature, to which we are invited, and of which we have an engaging foreta&s;te <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the TRANSFIGURED BODY of our LORD on Mount Ta|ber;&mdash;be it out bu&s;ine&s;s and delight, to love, honor, and obey the Lord our God with all our heart and with all our &s;oul, <Q>in every thing giving thanks and making ME|LODY in our hearts to the Lord</Q>&mdash;and to love our neighbour as our&s;elves.</P>

<P>So when "the AUTHOR OF PEACE, and LOVER OF CON|CORD" &s;hall again de&s;cend, and as at the fir&s;t, breathe into man the breath of life, every one, who&s;e life hath been a life of prai&s;e and love, and hope in Je&s;us, &s;hall again live, they &s;hall &s;tand in his &s;ight, and enter upon the employ|ment of never ending prai&s;e; and they &s;hall invite the whole creation to join with them, &s;aying <Q>O all ye works of the Lord, ble&s;s ye the Lord, prai&s;e him and magnify him for ever.</Q> They &s;hall in &s;eraphic and al|ternate hymns, ince&s;&s;antly chant Jehovah's works of Crea|tion, Providence, and Redemption, with the accompa|niment of &s;uch INSTRUMENTS OF MUSIC, of which, tho&s;e u&s;ed in the Temple and the Church have been the emblems types and &s;hadows.</P>
