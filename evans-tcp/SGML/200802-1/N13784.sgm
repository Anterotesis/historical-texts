<P>THE inducements to the publication of the fol|lowing letter at this di&s;tant period, from the date of it, proceed from a hope entertained by &s;ome devout per&s;ons, who have been edified by the &s;piri|tual experiences it contains, that it may prove in|&s;tructive and comforting to others alike piou&s;ly di&s;|po&s;ed, and to obviate the inconveniences to which manu&s;cripts are liable, through the negligence and inattention of tran&s;cribers, incorrect copies having been handed about;&mdash;it has therefore been revi&s;ed, and is now recommended to the &s;erious peru&s;al of tho&s;e who having entered on a religious life, may find encouragement and in&s;truction to pre&s;s forward with &s;tability and humble re&s;ignation, through the various probations and conflicts attending them in their chri&s;tian progre&s;s, that they may obtain under their &s;piritual leader, the grace of God, the end of their faith, the &s;alvation of their &s;ouls.</P>
<P>It may al&s;o be &s;atisfactory to the readers, to have &s;ome account given of the writer, and the per&s;on to whom the letter was wrote, they are therefore briefly informed that Elizabeth Webb was an acknowledged mini&s;ter among the people called Quakers, who from an apprehen&s;ion of religious duty, and the con|&s;traints of go&s;pel love, went from Penn&s;ylvania to Great Britain, to vi&s;it her friends there about the year 1712, and in London contracted &s;ome ac|quaintance with Anthony William Boehm, chaplain to prince George of Denmark, the con&s;ort of Ann, queen of England; he was by birth a <HI>German,</HI> but well acquainted with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> language, and died in the year 1722; the divers writings on religious &s;ubjects he has left, &s;hew him to be a man of a truly pious and catholic di&s;po&s;ition, which is al&s;o con|firmed by the te&s;timonials given of him by men of character in that time, who from their per&s;onal knowledge, mention him with great re&s;pect for his piety to God, and benevolence to mankind.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Worthy Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE kind re&s;pect thou &s;hewed me, when at London, hath laid me under an obligation wherein I find my mind drawn to communicate to thee in the open|ings of divine love, on which I mu&s;t de&s;ire thy favourable con&s;truction; as I am almo&s;t a &s;tranger to thee. What I have to write, hath been on my mind the&s;e &s;everal weeks, in that pure innocent love, in which is the communion of &s;aints. I have no learned method to deliver my religious experience ei|ther by word or writing, but plainly and &s;im|ply as the &s;pirit of truth directs, and I being the weaker ve&s;&s;el too, have the more need to beg to be excu&s;ed. I &s;hall not write from notions or &s;peculations; as at a di&s;tance, I look on &s;uch things as un&s;afe, and I know
<PB N="4" REF="017424_0004_0FA11A1F22009700">they are many times un&s;ound, but I &s;hall write a &s;mall part of what I have gone through, and what my &s;oul hath ta&s;ted of the good word of life, which is near, that we may have fellow&s;hip together in God the father of our &s;pirits, and in his &s;on Je|&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord, whom my &s;oul hath known, both in mercy and in judgment, to the mortifying, in a good degree, the fallen and corrupt nature, and to the puri|fying of my heart, &s;o far, that I can &s;ay to his prai&s;e, I do not &s;ee HIM through particular forms, &s;ects, party-impre&s;&s;i|ons, or any &s;uch thing; no, my dear friend, I never &s;ought after the Lord in the&s;e ways, nor for any of the&s;e ends, but I &s;ought after him in my young years for &s;alvation, and I &s;till &s;eek to him for the perfect re&s;toration of my &s;oul in him. I have nothing of my own to boa&s;t of, unle&s;s it be weakne&s;s and infirmities; but de&s;ire to rejoice in the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, by which I am crucified to the world, in a good degree, and the world to me, &s;o that I can &s;ay I die daily.</P>
<P>And as touching the fondne&s;s for educa|tion, religious profe&s;&s;ion and conver&s;ation, the&s;e things have ca&s;t no mi&s;t before my eyes.</P>
<P>I can &s;ee, own and love the image of my Lord and Saviour in any &s;ort of profe&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="5" REF="017424_0005_0FA11A2131CC1F88">if the &s;oul hath been educated in the hea|venly univer&s;ity or &s;chool of Chri&s;t, never|thele&s;s we cannot &s;ee God in or have fellow&s;hip with all &s;orts of conver&s;ations, that of the wicked is as <Q>if there was no God, God is not in all their thoughts:</Q> and &s;uch as de&s;pi&s;e the image of the meek, humble Je&s;us, and will follow none of his precepts, nor his &s;elf-denying example, whil&s;t they are here; the Lord will here|after de&s;pi&s;e their image; for they &s;hall have an image according to the feed or &s;pirit, in which they lay down their body; every &s;eed &s;hall have its own body in the re&s;urrection of the ju&s;t and the unju&s;t, and every one &s;hall receive his own &s;entence: Thou well ob&s;erve&s;t that &s;in, &s;elf-love, &s;elf-will, &amp;c. contract the &s;oul into a very nar|row compre&s;s, but the love of God, breaks down all tho&s;e walls of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s by which the &s;oul is hedged in and re&s;trained from univer&s;al love and benignity. This is very true, but, there are tho&s;e who will not re|ceive our love as it is in Je&s;us, neverthele&s;s &s;ome have felt the flowings of the love and compa&s;&s;ion of him, "that would not the death of a &s;inner, but rather that all would return to him, repent and live;" I am a witne&s;s for the Lord, that the &s;hedding a|broad of his love over the inhabitants of this nation, hath been like &s;howers of rain
<PB N="6" REF="017424_0006_0FA11A21DA3B2A08">in the &s;pring time, I well remember that I told a friend in <HI>London,</HI> I felt the di|vine extendings of the love of God, &s;o to &s;low to the people, as I walked in the &s;treets of the city, that I could have free|ly publi&s;hed the &s;alvation of God, which is near, and his righteou&s;ne&s;s which is ready to be revealed, in the publick places of concoar&s;e; the friend &s;aid he hoped it would not be required of me, this I mention to convince thee that univer&s;al love prevails in the hearts of &s;ome who are unknown to the world, and hardly known to their own brethren, and this is not to be wondered at, Eli did not know the inward exerci&s;e of Hannah, and the prophet Elijah thought he had been left alone, until the Lord told him he had &s;even thou&s;and in I&s;rael who had not bowed to Baal; the prophet Samuel, al&s;o when he looked out with an eye of rea&s;on on the goodne&s;s of the &s;tature of Eli|ab &s;aid, &s;urely the Lords anointed is be|fore him; &s;o now unle&s;s the Lord be plea&s;ed to reveal things to us, we are liable to mi&s;|take. But ble&s;&s;ed be the name of our mo&s;t gracious God, who is the &s;ame that ever he was, he &s;ees not as man &s;ees, for man looks at the outward appearance, but God looks at the heart.</P>
<P>I received thy &s;econd letter ju&s;t as I was going out of London, of which I have &s;ent
<PB N="7" REF="017424_0007_0FA11A2696352670">thee a copy, with &s;ome annotations, my view therein is that if thou thinks it it may be of benefit to any, thou may com|municate it; if not let it lie by thee.</P>
<P>I take great notice of thy chri&s;tian love and good advice in thy &s;econd letter, and do accept of it very heartily, and can a&s;&s;ure thee, that my labour is not to gather people into a formality, but I labour according as the Lord enables me to gather &s;ouls to Chri&s;t, who is able to make the deceitful hearts of the children of men, plain, ho|ne&s;t, upright and clean, and "when the in|&s;ide is clean, the out&s;ide will be clean al&s;o," but I freely acknowledge that the glory of the true church or my&s;tical body, or bride of Chri&s;t, which is made up of &s;ouls, who have entered into covenant with the Lord, to love and &s;erve him forever, is within, her cloathing is of wrought gold, and the curious needlework of virgin wi&s;dom is up|on her, for &s;he having been &s;tripped of all her old rags or garments of righteou&s;ne&s;s and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, and having been wa&s;h|ed in pure water, her bridegroom hath an|ointed her with holy oil, the holy unction of his &s;pirit, and he is cloathing her with the beautiful garment of his &s;alvation, the robe of his righteou&s;ne&s;s; &s;he is depending on him for her daily bread: So that &s;he is not eating her own bread, nor wearing her
<PB N="8" REF="017424_0008_0FA11A26C25F7BA0">own apparel; &s;he cannot be content only with bearing his name, but longs to be made more and more a partaker of his di|vine nature, and the love of her Lord hath been and &s;till is &s;o largely extended to her, with her love &s;o to him, that &s;he is wholly &s;ubject to him, he ruleth in love, and &s;he obeys in love, and this makes all things ea|&s;y; &s;he hath no will of her own, but the will of her Lord is her will in all things, all his commands are plea&s;ant to her, becau&s;e &s;he delights to wait on him, and to &s;erve in his pre&s;ence, and had rather be deprived of all outward enjoyments, than of his pre|&s;ence and the enjoyment of his favour, her conver&s;ation is adorned with humility and meekne&s;s, her &s;teps are comely in the eyes of her beloved, "all her children are taught of the Lord, e&s;tabli&s;hed in righteou&s;|ne&s;s, and great is their peace." And my foul may &s;ay to the prai&s;e and glory of God, that no greater comfort can be enjoyed on this &s;ide of the grave, than to be a child or member of this church.</P>
<P>And now, my dear friend, I will give thee a &s;hort account of the dealings of the Lord with me in my young years, how he brought my &s;oul through fire and water, for what end this hath lived in my mind I know not, except it be for our &s;piritual communion; but when my &s;oul is lowe&s;t
<PB N="9" REF="017424_0009_0FA11A2777F38838">and neare&s;t to the Lord in the &s;implicity of truth, then is my heart opened and my mind filled with divine love re&s;pecting this matter de&s;ire thee to peru&s;e it inwardly, when thou art retired, and not to judge of it before thou ha&s;t gone through it, and then judge as freely as thou plea&s;e&s;t: I was baptized and educated in the way of the church of England, I went to &s;chool to a mini&s;ter thereof, and loved and honoured him greatly, he &s;hewed great kindne&s;s and tenderne&s;s to me, and in tho&s;e days I looked on the mini&s;ters to be like angels, that brought glad tid|ings to the children of men; but when I was about fourteen years of age, I went to live at a knight's hou&s;e who kept a chaplain; I ob&s;erved his conver&s;ation and &s;aw it was vain, and I thought it ought not to be &s;o, and was troubled in my mind, for I then began to think on my latter end, and al&s;o on eternity, and I had no a&s;&s;urance of &s;alva|tion, or a &s;tate of happine&s;s, if it &s;hould plea&s;e the Lord to &s;end the me&s;&s;enger of death to call me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">way, &s;o the fear of the Lord laid hold on my mind, and I began to &s;earch the &s;criptures, and found they te&s;ti|fied that the wicked &s;hould be turned into hell, and all tho&s;e that forgot God; and I &s;aw that both prie&s;ts and people did too ge|nerally forget God, as &s;oon as they came off their knees or from their devotion, and
<PB N="10" REF="017424_0010_0FA11A2837BB9400">I was much afraid of hell, and wanted an a&s;&s;urance of a place in the kingdom of hea|ven; then I began to think on the great pro|mi&s;&s;es that were made for me in my bapti&s;m, as they called it, whereby they &s;aid I was made a member of Chri&s;t, a child of God &amp;c. and that I &s;hould renounce the devil and all his works, the pomps and vanities of this wicked world, and all the &s;inful lu&s;ts of the fle&s;h, and &s;hould keep God's holy will and commandments. I thought indeed this was the way to obtain a place in the kingdom of heaven, but I had no power to do what I ought to do, nor to for&s;ake what I ought to for&s;ake, for I was very proud, vain and airy, but as I was thus inwardly exerci&s;ed, and outwardly &s;earching the &s;criptures, my under&s;tanding was more and more opened, I read and took notice that the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, which he qualified and &s;ent forth to preach were to do it freely, for Chri&s;t &s;aid, "freely ye have received freely give," and that tho&s;e "who run when the Lord never &s;ent them, &s;hould not profit the people at all," and many &s;uch things open|ed in my mind and I u&s;ed to ponder them in my heart, and the promi&s;es to the flock in the 34th of Ezekiel, where the Lord promi&s;ed to bind up that which was brok|en, and to &s;trengthen that which was &s;ick. Tho&s;e and &s;uch like portions of the &s;crip|tures,
<PB N="11" REF="017424_0011_0FA11A290873F4A8">were very comfortable to me, for I was &s;ick of my &s;ins, and my heart was broken many times before the Lord, and I thought, Oh that I had lived in the days of Chri&s;t, I would &s;urely have been one of tho&s;e that followed him, and I grieved be|cau&s;e the Jews crucified him, &s;o that I loved Chri&s;t in the outward appearance, and could have &s;aid (as Peter &s;aid) far be it from thee Lord to &s;uffer: Yet I did not know he was &s;o near me by his holy &s;pirit; but I was convinced that the hireling &s;hepherds who teach for hire and divine for money<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Micah 3, 11.</NOTE> were not the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, by the te&s;timony of the prophets and of Chri&s;t him&s;elf, who &s;aid "by their fruits ye &s;hall know them," &s;o I left going to hear them; and walked alone, for I went &s;o long till a fear followed me into the wor&s;hip hou&s;e, and I thought it would be ju&s;t upon me, if I was made an example for my inattention, to the &s;pirit of truth. And when I was about fifteen years old, it plea&s;ed God to &s;end the &s;pirit of grace and &s;upplication, into my heart, by which I prayed fervently unto the Lord; there was a divine breathing in my &s;oul, I had no life in my forms of prayer, except that one which Chri&s;t taught his di&s;ciples, for which I have al|ways had a reverent e&s;teem, but when I was in a &s;tate to pray, I found that the &s;pirit made in|terce&s;&s;ion
<PB N="12" REF="017424_0012_0FA11A2A118B64E0">in me and for me, according to the pre&s;ent want and nece&s;&s;ity of my &s;oul, I remember the expre&s;&s;ions that u&s;ed to run through my mind were Oh Lord! pre&s;erve me in thy fear and in thy truth. Oh Lord! &s;hew me thy way, and make known thy mind and will unto me;&mdash;and I thought I was ready to obey it, and much de&s;ired to know the people of God, for my &s;oul cried, Oh Lord where do&s;t thou feed thy flock, why &s;hould I be as one that is turned a&s;ide from the flocks of thy com|panions. Oh the drawing cords of thy divine love. Oh thou did&s;t draw my &s;oul with longings and breathings after the knowledge of the only true God, and of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. There was then no condemna|tion for the &s;ins of ignorance which the Lord winked at, but he called me to re|pent and for&s;ake my pride and vain com|pany, which was a great cro&s;s to the will of the fle&s;h, and I took it up for &s;everal months, and while I did &s;o, my &s;oul had great peace and divine comfort, &s;o that many times the enjoyment of divine love was more to me than my natural food, or any outward thing. I remember when the family u&s;ed to a&s;k me why I did not come to meat, I u&s;ed to think I had meat to eat, they knew nothing of, and in tho&s;e times of retirement, I had manife&s;tations of &s;uf|ferings,
<PB N="13" REF="017424_0013_0FA11A2BD725C030">that I &s;hould go through, and a &s;ight of &s;everal things which I met with &s;ince, and in tho&s;e times I walked alone; I was convinced that the Quakers held the principles of truth, and that their mini&s;try was the true mini&s;try, but I dwelt then far from any of them, only thus it had happen|ed. When I was about twelve years old, I was at a meeting or two of theirs, and the doctrine of one man that preached there, proved to me (as the wi&s;e man terms it) "like bread ca&s;t upon the waters, for it was found after many days," the &s;ound of his voice &s;eemed to be in my mind, when I was alone, and &s;ome of his words came fre&s;h into my remembrance, and the voice and the words &s;uited with the exerci&s;e of my mind, and at that time I met al&s;o with a little book of theirs, which as the doc|trine it contained agreed with the doctrine of the apo&s;tles, I was confirmed in my judgment, that their profe&s;&s;ion agreed with the truth, but did not join with them, for by that time fle&s;h and blood began to be very unea&s;y, under the yoke of retirement, and to groan for liberty. I was about &s;ix|teen years old, and the &s;ubtle enemy lay near, and did not want in&s;truments; &s;o I was per&s;uaded by rea&s;oning with fle&s;h and blood, that I was young and might take a little more plea&s;ure, and might

Oh the remem|brance of that mi&s;pent time! Oh the tribu|lation that came on me for my di&s;o|bedience, is never to be forgotten by me: But when I was about nineteen years of age, it plea&s;ed the Almighty to &s;end his quick|ning &s;pirit again into my heart, and his light &s;hined into my mind, all my tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions were &s;et in order before me, and I was made deeply &s;en&s;ible of my great lo&s;s; and then, Oh! then the vials of the wrath
<PB N="15" REF="017424_0015_0FA11A2FA3650900">of an angry father, were poured out on the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing nature, Oh! then I cried, woe is me, woe is me, I am undone, I have &s;lain the babe of grace, I have crucified the Lord of life and glory to my&s;elf afre&s;h, al|though I have not put him to open &s;hame, for I had been pre&s;erved in moral hone&s;ty in all re&s;pects, to that degree, that I dur&s;t not tell a lye, or &s;peak an evil word, and could be tru&s;ted in any place, and in any thing, for this would be in my mind many times, that if I was not faithful in the un|righteous mammon, I &s;hould not be tru&s;t|ed with the heavenly trea&s;ure, but not|with&s;tanding my righteou&s;ne&s;s, he who&s;e eye penetrates all hearts found me &s;o guil|ty, that I thought there was no mercy for me, Oh! that te&s;timony of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord Je&s;us, I found to be true (viz.) Ex|cept your righteou&s;ne&s;s exceed the righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, there is no admittance into the kingdom of hea|ven or favour of God. But after many days and nights of &s;orrow and great angui&s;h, having no &s;oul to &s;peak to, it came into my mind to give my&s;elf up into the hands of God, and I &s;aid, Oh Lord! if I peri&s;h, it &s;hall be at the gate of thy mercy, for if thou ca&s;t me into hell, I cannot help my&s;elf, therefore I will give up my &s;oul, my life, and all into thy holy hand, do thy plea&s;ure
<PB N="16" REF="017424_0016_0FA11A30E13E8F20">by me, thy judgements are ju&s;t, for I have &s;lighted thy &s;weet love, and have &s;lain the babe of grace. And as I &s;unk down into death, and owned and &s;ubmitted to the judgments of God, my heart was broken, which before was hard, and it plea&s;ed my merciful father to cau&s;e his divine &s;weet love, to &s;pring again in my hard, dry and barren &s;oul, as a &s;pring of living water, and the fire of the wrath of God was migh|tily abated, and the compa&s;&s;ionate bowels of a tender &s;aviour my &s;oul felt, I had living hope rai&s;ed in my mind, yet greater afflictions came afterwards, &s;o that I may &s;ay by experience, "&s;trait is the gate and narrow is the way indeed, that leads to life;" and I have cau&s;e to believe, none but &s;uch as are made willing to be &s;tript of all that belongs to &s;elf, or the old man, and do become as a little child, can rightly or truly enter in at the &s;trait gate.

After my inward tribulation was abat|ed, then outward tryals began, for there were &s;ome of no &s;mall account, that en|deavoured with all their might and cunning, to hinder the work from pro&s;pering in me, and as Saul hunted David, and &s;ought to take away his natural life, &s;o the&s;e hunted my &s;oul to take away its life, which it had in God, but all wrought together for my good.

This brought great comfort to my &s;oul, and I trea&s;ured it in my heart, and I made this ob&s;ervation, that from that time the Lord gave my &s;oul (as the apo&s;tle Peter expre&s;&s;es it) a more abundant entrance into the heavenly kingdom or New Jeru&s;alem, who&s;e walls are &s;alvation and her gates prai&s;e, and my mind was brought into more &s;tillne&s;s, and trouble&s;ome thoughts were in a good degree expelled, and my outward enemies grew weary of their work and fail|ed of their hope.

So after I had peace at home every way, I was drawn by the &s;pirit of love, to travel into the North of England, and on my jour|ney my &s;oul had many combats with the evil &s;pirit; when I was a&s;leep he tormented me as long as he could. I have indeed had a long war with the devil many ways, and abundance of courage was given to me to make war with him, and I always gained the victory, when cowardly fearful nature was a&s;leep, which was comfortable to my mind, and I did hope that the Lord would give me perfect victory over the devil when I was awake, as he had let me &s;ee it to be &s;o when I was a&s;leep, and the &s;pirit which led me forth, was to me like a needle of a compa&s;s, touched with a load&s;tone, for &s;o it pointed where I ought to go, and when I came to the far end of the journey. In tho&s;e days I had certain manife&s;tations of many things in dreams, which did come to pa&s;s according to their &s;ignifications, and I was many times forewarned of enemies, and &s;o was better able to guard again&s;t them; I travelled in great fear and humili|ty, and the Lord was with me to his glory and my comfort, and brought me home a|gain, in peace. And in the year 1697, in the
<PB N="35" REF="017424_0035_0FA11B7BF6725AC0">&s;ixth month, as I was &s;itting in a meeting in Glouce&s;ter, which was then the place of my abode, my mind was gathered into perfect &s;tillne&s;s for &s;ome time, and my &s;pirit was as if it had been carried away into America, and after it returned, my heart was as if it had been di&s;&s;olved with the love of God, and it flowed over the great Ocean, and I was con&s;trained to kneel down and pray for the &s;eed of God in America, and the con|cern never went out of my mind day nor night, until I went to travel there in the love of God, which is &s;o univer&s;al that it reaches over &s;ea and land; but when I looked at my concern with an eye of human rea&s;on, it &s;eemed to be very &s;trange and hard to me, for I knew not the country, nor any that dwelt therein; and I rea&s;oned much concerning my own unfitne&s;s, but when I let in &s;uch rea&s;onings, I had nothing but death and darkne&s;s, and trouble at|tended my mind, but when I re&s;igned up my all to the Lord, and gave up in my mind to go, then the divine love did &s;pring up in my heart, and my &s;oul was at liberty to wor&s;hip the Lord as in the land of the liv|ing; thus I tryed and proved the concern &s;everal times in my own heart, till at la&s;t the&s;e words ran through my mind with au|thority (viz.) The fearful and unbelieving &s;hall have their portion with the hypocrite
<PB N="36" REF="017424_0036_0FA11B7CB95C24A0">in the lake that burns with fire and brim|&s;tone; which is the &s;econd death; this brought a dread, and I told my hu&s;band that I had a concern on my mind to go to America, and a&s;ked him if he could give me up. He &s;aid he hoped it would not be required of me; but I told him it was, and that I &s;hould not go without his free con&s;ent, which &s;eemed a little hard to him at fir&s;t, but a little while after I was taken with a violent fever, which brought me &s;o weak, that all that &s;aw me thought I &s;hould not recover. But I thought my days work was not done, and my chief concern in my &s;ick|ne&s;s was about going to America. But &s;ome were troubled that I had made it pub|lick, becau&s;e they thought I &s;hould die, and people would &s;peak reproachfully of me, and &s;aid, if I did recover, the &s;hip would be ready to &s;ail before I &s;hould be fit to go, &amp;c. But I thought if they would but carry me and lay me down in the &s;hip, I &s;hould be well, for the Lord was very gra|cious to my &s;oul in the time of my &s;ickne&s;s, and gave me a promi&s;e that his pre&s;ence &s;hould go with me ; and then my hu&s;band was made very willing to give me up, he &s;aid if it were for &s;even years, rather than to have me taken from him forever. So at la&s;t all tho&s;e difficulties pa&s;&s;ed over, and I failed from Bri&s;tol in the 9th month, 1697, with
<PB N="37" REF="017424_0037_0FA11B7D754EAEC8">my companion Mary Rogers. The dangers we were in at &s;ea, and the faith and cou|rage the Lord gave to my &s;oul would be too large here to relate, for I had &s;uch an evi|dence of my being in my proper place, that the fear of death was taken away; Oh! it is good to tru&s;t in the Lord and be obedient to him, for his mercies endure forever; &s;o about the middle of the 12th month, 1697, through the good providence of the Al|mighty, we arrived in Virginia, and as I travelled along the country from one meet|ing to another, I ob&s;erved great numbers of black people, that were in &s;lavery, and they were a &s;trange people to me, and I wanted to know whether the vi&s;itation of God was to their &s;ouls or not, and I ob&s;erved their conver&s;ation, to &s;ee if I could di&s;cern any good in them, &s;o after I had travelled a|bout four weeks, as I was in bed one morning in an hou&s;e in Maryland, after the &s;un was up and &s;hone into the chamber, I fell into a &s;lumber, and dreamed I was a &s;ervant in a great man's hou&s;e, and that I was drawing water at a well to wa&s;h the uppermo&s;t rooms of the hou&s;e, and when I was at the well, a voice came to me, which bid me go and call other &s;ervants to help me and I went pre&s;ently; but as I was going a|long in a very plea&s;ant green meadow, a great light &s;hined about me, which exceed|ed

We &s;hall be the better able to bear the impre&s;&s;ion of his image upon us in all our conver&s;ations, and if the day &s;hould come, wherein none &s;hall buy nor &s;ell, that have not the mark of the bea&s;t, either in their right hand or in their forehead, it is but what hath been told us beforehand, and the&s;e that will know an overcoming, it mu&s;t be by the blood of the lamb, (viz.) by a|biding in the meek, love, and &s;uffering &s;eed, and by the word of their te&s;timony, and that love not their lives unto death, we may ob&s;erve that tho&s;e that had not the mark of the bea&s;t in their forehead, if they had in their right hand it would do, they could &s;hew it if there was occa&s;ion, to keep off a

Oh the my&s;tery of iniquity how &s;ecretly it works, we may well &s;ay, the te&s;timony that Je&s;us bore to the young man, that de&s;ired to follow him, is very true, "Foxes have holes and fowls of the air have ne&s;ts, but the &s;on of man hath not where to lay his head," Oh! Innocent truth, Oh! plain, meek, humble Je&s;us, where doth he repo&s;e, where doth he reign without mo|le&s;tation.</P>
<P>Dear Friend, excu&s;e my freedom with thee, for the love of God con&s;traineth me, and I do believe that the Lord will &s;hew thee yet further, what te&s;timony thou mu&s;t bear for his name, and what thou mu&s;t &s;uffer for his &s;ake, (if faithful) for trying times will come, and offences will be gi|ven (and taken) but there is nothing will offend tho&s;e that love the Lord Je&s;us above all, for altho' many murmured and were offended at Je&s;us when he told them the truth, and that which was of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for all to know and witne&s;s in them&s;elves, as we read in the 6th of John, beginning at the 32d ver&s;e in his an&s;wer to the Jews, but by that time he had done, many of his di&s;ciples went from him, then &s;aid he to the twelve, "Will ye al&s;o go a|way." But Peter &s;aid, "whether &s;hall we go, thou ha&s;t the words of eternal life,
<PB N="41" REF="017424_0041_0FA11B83D443D208">and we believe and are &s;ure, thou art Chri&s;t the &s;on of the living God." So God hath given to the faithful to believe, yea, and we are &s;ure that the &s;pirit of truth is come, that leads the followers of it into all truth, and that Chri&s;t who is one with his &s;pirit, who was once offered, to bear the &s;ins of many, has appeared again the &s;econd time without &s;in unto &s;alvation. Oh! &s;urely the goodne&s;s of God hath been very great to the children of men from age to age, and from one generation to another, ever &s;ince the fall of our fir&s;t parents, the more my mind penetrates into it, the more I am like to be &s;wallowed up in admiration of his conde&s;cen&s;ion and goodne&s;s through all his di&s;pen&s;ations, but above all in tne manife&s;|tation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t our holy pattern and heavenly leader, Oh! my &s;oul prai&s;e him for whom the knowledge of his holy foot|&s;teps, God gave for a light to us gen|tiles? and to be his &s;alvation to the ends of the earth, and hath given his &s;pirit to dwell in us, and accepted our &s;ouls to dwell in him. Oh admirable goodne&s;s! &s;hall we leave him? He is the word of eternal life, and whither &s;hall we go? and &s;o far as any are followers of Je&s;us, &s;o far I de&s;ire to fol|low them, or to be one with them, and no further, let the&s;e do what they will, if any will go back into the &s;ea, out of which the
