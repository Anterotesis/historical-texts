<SALUTE><HI>Sir</HI> WILLIAM KEITH,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my la&s;t of the 25th of <HI>February,</HI> by the <HI>Beaver,</HI> inclo&s;ing an Agreement made with the Lord <HI>Baltemore,</HI> for the quieting of the People of both Provinces in their Settlements on the Borders, I wrote my Sentiments freely in &s;ome Points relating to thy &s;elf and the Government, &s;ince which, I have, with the Principal of the Tru&s;tees and other Friends, con&s;idered more clo&s;ely of the Province and our Intere&s;t there, which &s;eems of late to be under &s;ome Di&s;couragement, and to have &s;uffer'd by Irregularities, which it is high Time &s;hould be remedied; and it may be worthy of thy own Reflection to con&s;ider, whether much of thy late Conduct, together with &s;o apparent a Ne|glect of us, might not give us too much Rea&s;on to doubt whether thou did&s;t look upon thy &s;elf to be any longer accountable to us, or whether thou ha&s;t not entertained an Opinion, that &s;ince my Husband's De|cea&s;e, the Circum&s;tances of the Family had put it out of our Power to take any new Mea&s;ures with that Government: But I mu&s;t take this Opportunity to let thee know, that we could long ere this have found Means to convince thee to the contrary, had it not been for our tender Regard to thy Family and the Hopes we had conceiv'd that thou would&s;t have made the be&s;t Application of thy known Abili|ties to the Intere&s;t of thy Con&s;tituents: And to the Intent that thy future Management may be more to our Satisfaction, I &s;hall now give thee &s;ome further In&s;tructions, which I &s;hall expect thoul't punctually ob&s;erve, together with tho&s;e formerly given thee with thy Commi&s;&s;i|on. And in the fir&s;t Place,</P>
<P>As I have with the Tru&s;tees made a farther Nomination and Ap|pointment of Per&s;ons to manage our Proprietary Affairs there, by the Names of <HI>Agents</HI> or <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners,</HI> thou art to a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e Commi&s;&s;i|oners with the Powers of Government, in all Ca&s;es where nece&s;&s;ary or requi&s;ite for advancing our ju&s;t Intere&s;t, and e&s;pecially to &s;ee the Au|thority of the Courts and Laws exerted again&s;t tho&s;e who on any Pretence invade or detain our Rights from us: And if in any Ca&s;e there &s;hould be Occa&s;ion to u&s;e the Powers of Legi&s;lature thou art to apply thy be&s;t Endeavours to procure the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the A&s;&s;embly to joyn with thee in pa&s;&s;ing &s;uch further Laws as may on &s;uch Occa&s;ions be wanted. And here I cannot but take Notice of thy Imprudence and great Mi&s;take in a Point of this Nature, as mention'd in thy la&s;t Letter to me.</P>
<P>As in all the Changes of the Governours there, the Dependance of the Proprietor and his Family has been chiefly on their Friends in the Council, who&s;e Recommendation alone was (as thou mu&s;t needs
<PB N="2" REF="002576_0002_0FDBB805439DFAC8">
remember) the fir&s;t and chief Step to thy Advancement to the Place thou enjoys, we mu&s;t &s;till rely on their Advice and A&s;&s;i&s;tance, as our principal Security, and more e&s;pecially upon &s;uch of them as were confided in by my late Husband; but as thy Mea&s;ures with the Coun|cil (as I have been a&s;&s;ured by divers Hands) have been new and &s;in|gular, it is now ab&s;olutely required, that thou reform them as follows, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P>That no Per&s;on be called to that Board, and admitted a Member of it without being fir&s;t propo&s;ed and approved of in a Council im|partially and equally conven'd, con&s;i&s;ting of at lea&s;t two Thirds of the whole Number of acting Members, after which he may be admitted at the next Sitting. But as that Country was principally &s;ettled by tho&s;e of our Profe&s;&s;ion called <HI>Quakers,</HI> 'tis expected, that at lea&s;t one hal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the whole Number &s;hall be of that Profe&s;&s;ion: And if any Per&s;on has been call'd to that Board, without having been fir&s;t ap|proved as afore&s;aid, that he be excluded till &s;uch Time as he &s;hall be approved, and that the Number of Acting Members re&s;ident in the Government, con&s;i&s;t not of le&s;s than Eight, nor of more than Twelve at one Time.</P>
<P>The Powers of Legi&s;lature being at pre&s;ent lodged &s;olely in the Governour and <HI>A&s;&s;embly,</HI> without &s;o much as a <HI>Negative</HI> re&s;erved to the Proprietor when ab&s;ent, it is of the highe&s;t Importance for our Security, as well as for that of the Country, that Matters of Legi|&s;lation &s;hould be carried on, with the mo&s;t mature Advi&s;ement and De|liberation: For it never was intended, that every new Governour &s;hould with an A&s;&s;embly Annually cho&s;en, proceed to make what new Laws they &s;hould think proper, to be tran&s;mitted directly to the King's Mini&s;ters, without any other Check. It has therefore been the more &s;urprizing to &s;ee thee (from whom it could have been lea&s;t expected) to be the fir&s;t Author of &s;o dangerous an Innovation, which entirely takes off the Security, which the Proprietor ever had, and ab&s;olutely required of his former Deputies, that nothing &s;hould be tran&s;acted by them with any A&s;&s;embly, but with the joynt Concurrence and Appro|bation of his Friends in the Council. Therefore for Remedy of this Grievance, it is required,</P>
<P>That thou advi&s;e with the Council upon every Meeting and Ad|journment of the A&s;&s;embly which requires any Deliberation on the Governour's Part; that thou make no Speech, nor &s;end any written Me&s;&s;age to the A&s;&s;embly, but what &s;hall be fir&s;t approved in Council; that thou receive all Me&s;&s;ages from them in Council, if practicable at the Time, and &s;halt return no Bill to the Hou&s;e, without the Advice of the Council, nor pa&s;s any what&s;oever into a Law, without the Con&s;ent of Majority of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>That the Minutes of Council be regularly kept, and tho&s;e of the preceding Council be read and approved at the next Meeting, and &s;hall always remain in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Clerk of the Council.</P>
<P>I ought to have taken more Notice than I &s;hall do of the la&s;t Letter I ever received from thee, being of the 5th of <HI>July,</HI> 1722. But as I look'd upon it only as the Effect of &s;ome warm Re&s;entment, I &s;hall for
<PB N="3" REF="002576_0003_0FDBB938D3EAF7F0">
divers Rea&s;ons choo&s;e to &s;ay no more of it here. I mu&s;t however further ob&s;erve, that <HI>James Logan</HI> &s;ince his Arrival here, has to our Surprize on all Occa&s;ions refu&s;ed the Title of <HI>Secretary</HI> of that Province, which upon Inquiry into the Cau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, I find is owing to thy appointing by thy Commi&s;&s;ion under the Great Seal, another Per&s;on (an entire Stran|ger to u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">) to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> as Secretary of the Government in all Ca&s;es where any Profits ari&s;e, as well as Clerk of the Council. Upon which I cannot but tell thee, that my Husband the late Proprietor and Go|vernour, after a full Experience of his Probity, Fidelity and Capa|city for that Employment, appointed him not only Secretary of the Province, but entru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ed him particularly with the Management of his Affairs, as his Receiver General, and continued the &s;ame Confidence in him &s;o far as to name him to be one of the Tru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ees of his la&s;t Will. And I m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> do him the Ju&s;tice to &s;ay, That we have had long Experience of his many faithful Services, and of his con&s;tant Care and Zeal to promote and &s;upport our Intere&s;t in that Country. We have &s;een the Ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ne&s;s of his Accompts, which have been care|fully examined &s;ince his coming over, and &s;uch an In&s;tance of his Fi|delity in making of our Returns (whereby we have been benefitted many Hundreds of Pounds by &s;aving the Exchange) as can leave us no room to &s;u&s;pect his Integrity in the Management of any of our Affairs that have been under his Care; and therefore I &s;hould very much wrong both him and my &s;elf to look upon him in any other View than that of a very hone&s;t and capable Man, and my true and faithful Friend. 'Tis therefore what we could never have expected, that a Gentleman who obtain'd that Government by my Husband's Commi&s;&s;ion, and &s;till holds it on the Foot of the &s;ame Appointment, &s;hould without any Notice to, or Direction from us, and without ever advi&s;ing with his Council (as his In&s;tructions enjoyn him in &s;uch Ca|&s;es) take upon him to di&s;place &s;uch an Officer. It is therefore ex|pected and required, that all Commi&s;&s;ions invalidating tho&s;e to him &s;hall be forthwith be made void.</P>
<P>That the Le&s;&s;er <HI>Seal</HI> of the Province be re-delivered to him, and remain in his Cu&s;tody, as it ever was from his Arrival there to thy Acce&s;&s;ion to the Government; That he, by him&s;elf or his Deputy &s;hall exerci&s;e all the Parts of the Secretary's-Office; That all In&s;tru|ments and Writings &s;ign'd by the Governour, excepting Military Com|mi&s;&s;ions and Licen&s;es for Marriage be done in his Office, and &s;eal'd with the Seal of the Province. That only he, or &s;uch Per&s;ons as he &s;hall appoint with the Approbation of the Council, be Clerk of that Board, and that all the Minutes of the Council &s;hall remain in his Keeping. In all which I de&s;ire and expect that there be no He&s;itation or Delay; and that for the future all Means be u&s;ed to cultivate and pre&s;erve a good Under&s;tanding between you, for the publick Peace and General Good of the Province and my Family.</P>
<P>As to the Acts for a Paper-Credit, tho' the Merchants here inveigh very much again&s;t them and the Manner of pa&s;&s;ing them, has given us Rea&s;on to be di&s;&s;atisfied, and might have tempted us to have had them repeal'd (which was ea&s;ily practicable) yet upon a mature Deli|beration
<PB N="4" REF="002576_0004_0FDBB93A3B37C658">
we have re&s;olved to &s;uffer the pa&s;&s;ing them, yet with this full Expectation that all po&s;&s;ible Care be taken to &s;upport their Credit by any farther Acts that may be nece&s;&s;ary for that Purpo&s;e, and all other Means that may conduce to that End. But we hope and expect that thou wilt never give thy A&s;&s;ent to the pa&s;&s;ing any Law for the creating any more &s;uch Paper-Credit.</P>
<P>We have been very much pleas'd with the happy Event of the Trea|ty at <HI>Albany,</HI> after the unfortunate Death of the <HI>Indian</HI> that lo&s;t his Life in the Province; and we cannot but approve the Conduct of the Government in that Affair, and acknowledge not only the Care of the Governour him&s;elf, but al&s;o of tho&s;e Gentlemen who undertook &s;o fa|tiguing a Journey for the Service of the Publick. And we hope and de&s;ire the &s;ame Care of tho&s;e poor People the <HI>Indians</HI> may &s;till be continued, that the &s;ame Mea&s;ures my Husband fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed with them may be con&s;tantly pur&s;ued, and that on all Occa&s;ions of Mo|ment, the Council, e&s;pecially tho&s;e Members of it, who are entru&s;ted with the Affairs of Property, may be con&s;ulted, and that all Treaties with them may be managed with their Concurrence and Approbation.</P>
<P>We have had lately a Meeting with Lord <HI>Baltemore</HI> upon the &s;ettling the Boundaries; and tho' we cannot yet come to an Agreement there|in, yet his Lord&s;hip &s;eems no le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed than we are to determine that Di&s;pute &s;ome Way or other, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, which we hope may be done within the Time agreed upon for a mutual Ce&s;&s;ation. However we de&s;ire thou wilt u&s;e the &s;ame Vigilance, which <HI>J. Logan</HI> tells us, thou ha&s;t always exerted to defend the Province, again&s;t all Incroachments, if any &s;hould be attempted by the <HI>Marylanders.</HI></P>
<P>To the&s;e I &s;hall only add, that as thou wert cho&s;en in the Time of my Husband's Weakne&s;s, by the Means of his Friends only to that important Tru&s;t, it would be with &s;ome Regret &s;hould we be obliged to make a Change before our final Settlement with the Crown, tho' the Means are ready at hand: We therefore earne&s;tly de&s;ire that thy Skill and Abilities may be employ'd to render thy Continuance yet grateful to us, which can be no other way effected, than by thy &s;trict Ob&s;er|vation of thy former and the&s;e pre&s;ent In&s;tructions.</P>
<P>To conclude, I recommend to thy utmo&s;t Care to promote and en|courage Vertue, Sobriety, Peace and Love among all the Inhabitants; to reconcile all Animo&s;ities and Factions for thy own Honour, the Reputation of the Country, and our Satisfaction; a &s;peedy Account of which will be mo&s;t acceptable to us. And in this I earne&s;tly de|&s;ire the Lord may ble&s;s thy Endeavours, from whence the mo&s;t &s;olid Comfort will ari&s;e to thy &s;elf, and a very great one to</P>
