<BIBL>NEHEMIAH V. 19.</BIBL>
<Q>Think upon me, my GOD, for good, according to all that I have done for this people.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS is the language of a ruler, who was an ardent lover of his nation. He had done much for the people over whom he was placed, and had the &s;atisfaction ari&s;ing from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, that he had &s;erved them from the be&s;t principles and the pure&s;t motives. He could appeal to
<PB N="6" REF="030738_0005_0FE8D66536621A98">
God, to whom he had re&s;pect in the di&s;charge of the duties of his office, and with comfort hope in him for that reward in his favor, which he hath graciou&s;ly encouraged all, who do well, to expect. Happy are tho&s;e ru|lers, who, like NEHEMIAH, have the intere&s;t of their people at heart, and under the habitual in|fluence of the fear of God, and with a prevail|ing regard to his approbation, exert them&s;elves for the promotion of their welfare! Happy is that people that is di&s;tingui&s;hed with &s;uch ru|lers!</P>
<P>IN the following di&s;cour&s;e, I propo&s;e, in con|formity to the occa&s;ion of the pre&s;ent meeting, and the ideas &s;ugge&s;ted by the pa&s;&s;age ju&s;t read, to con&s;ider the de&s;ign of civil government, and the importance of religion in tho&s;e, to whom the admini&s;tration of it is committed.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> LET us con&s;ider briefly, the de&s;ign of the in&s;titution of civil government.</P>
<P>THIS is intimated in the text to be the bene|fit of the people: <HI>According to all that I have done for this people.</HI></P>
<P>COULD men have been as &s;ecure in their lives and properties, and enjoyed equal happine&s;s in a &s;tate of nature, as in a &s;tate of &s;ociety, civil pol|ity
<PB N="7" REF="030738_0006_0FE8D66CABB04BB0">
would never have been erected among them. It is unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that any number of men, inhabiting any portion of the earth, would ever have come into an agreement to re|linqui&s;h &s;ome of their natural rights as individ|uals, and to &s;ubmit to certain laws deriving their authority from &s;uch agreement, without a view to their greater advantage&mdash;to the more effectual &s;ecurity of their mo&s;t valuable rights, liberties and privileges.</P>
<P>MAN is formed for &s;ociety. Such are his fac|ulties&mdash;his natural de&s;ires, inclinations and ca|pacities, that he would be unea&s;y without an in|tercour&s;e with his fellow-creatures.&mdash;Such his weakne&s;s and his wants, that without their aid, he could not exi&s;t comfortably, if he could exi&s;t at all. And &s;uch are the lu&s;ts of men, from whence come wars and fightings, that the weak|er would always be in danger from the &s;tronger, without the protection of laws, which numbers agree to adopt and &s;upport, for their mutual &s;afety and advantage.</P>
<P>THIS being the ca&s;e, nothing is more natural and rea&s;onable, than that numbers &s;hould a&s;&s;o|ciate for the defence, a&s;&s;i&s;tance and improvement of one another. And though, by &s;uch a&s;&s;ocia|tion, they put them&s;elves out of a &s;tate of natural
<PB N="8" REF="030738_0007_0FE8D66E43F3EEB0">
freedom, they are richly compen&s;ated therefor, by the numerous important benefits to be enjoy|ed only in a &s;tate of civil &s;ociety.</P>
<P>THE end of the appointment of civil rulers cannot be their own per&s;onal honor and emolu|ment, but the benefit of tho&s;e over whom they are placed. Rulers are made for the nation, and not the nation for rulers.</P>
<P>As members of &s;ociety, they are to enjoy in common with others, the advantages re&s;ulting from the &s;ocial compact. As rulers, they are entitled to an honourable &s;upport, and to all that re&s;pect and e&s;teem, which the dignity of their &s;tations and the importance of their &s;ervi|ces render fit and proper. They are not, how|ever, to &s;eek their own &s;eparate intere&s;t, but the intere&s;t and welfare of the community.</P>
<P>THESE dictates of nature and rea&s;on, the dic|tates of revelation &s;trengthen and confirm. In the book of in&s;piration it is expre&s;sly &s;aid of the civil ruler, "He is the mini&s;ter of God to thee for good. Rulers are not a terror to good works but to the evil. They are God's mini&s;ters, at|tending continually upon this very thing."</P>
<P>THE benevolent author of our exi&s;tence&mdash;of our capacities and all the means of improvement
<PB N="9" REF="030738_0008_0FE8D675D09BF400">
and happine&s;s, in the directions he has given in his word, re&s;pecting the qualifications and duties of rulers, as well as corre&s;pondent conduct of the people, has an evident view to the good of &s;ociety&mdash;that the members in general, "may lead a quiet and peaceful life in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty."</P>
<P>VARIOUS are the forms and con&s;titutions of government, which the different genius, prejudi|ces, circum&s;tances, &s;ituations and cu&s;toms of men, have led them to frame and adopt. That in ju&s;tly accounted the mo&s;t eligible for a partic|ular people, which is be&s;t adapted, under their circum&s;tances, to promote and &s;ecure the great end for which magi&s;tracy is appointed. But no form of government can en&s;ure happine&s;s to a people, unle&s;s it be well admini&s;tered.</P>
<P>A CONSTITUTION, in many re&s;pects defect|ive, in the hands of an able and upright admin|i&s;tration, may be rendered &s;ub&s;ervient to the &s;ig|nal pro&s;perity of a people. Whereas, a far more perfect form of government, in the hands of ru|lers of an oppo&s;ite character, will fail of affording the citizens that protection and &s;ecurity, that peace and quietne&s;s, without which they cannot but be mi&s;erable.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="030738_0009_0FE8D677B0236128">
IF the&s;e ob&s;ervations be ju&s;t, what a po&s;t of importance is that of the civil magi&s;trate! His elevated &s;tation, as it is a &s;tation of honor, is al&s;o one of labor and high re&s;pon&s;ibility; and it will be no further honorable to him, than as he fills it with dignity, and u&s;efulne&s;s to the public.</P>
<P>THE care of tho&s;e things which re&s;pect the welfare of a great people requires the clo&s;e and unintermitted attention of the civil ruler. To attend to their &s;ituation with regard to other powers&mdash;to provide for their defence again&s;t for|eign inva&s;ion and internal &s;edition&mdash;to &s;ecure tho&s;e advantages that may ju&s;tly be derived from an intercour&s;e with other nations&mdash;to attend to the internal &s;tate of the commonwealth&mdash;to its fi|nances&mdash;to its agriculture&mdash;commerce&mdash;manu|factures&mdash;morals&mdash;learning and religion; to make &s;uch alteration in the laws, or &s;uch new ones, as the varying circum&s;tances of the country, &s;tate, towns and corporations, may render expedient, and take effectual care to have them executed, is a mo&s;t laborious and difficult employment. Such a variety of great, intere&s;ting and compli|cated bu&s;ine&s;s cannot be properly performed but by men of &s;uperior ability, knowledge and wi&s;|dom, firmne&s;s and integrity.</P>
<P>THEY who are called to &s;u&s;tain the weight of
<PB N="11" REF="030738_0010_0FE8D67F1CAF9120">
government, and to manage the great affairs of the &s;tate and nation, need the united influence of every argument and motive, adapted to &s;trengthen and invigorate the human mind, and to encourage and animate them in their arduous work.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I PROCEED to con&s;ider the import|ance of religion in the civil ruler. <HI>Think upon me, my God, for good.</HI></P>
<P>THIS reque&s;t, in connexion with what it is grounded upon in the latter part of the text, im|plies, that NEHEMIAH had acted under the in|fluence of religion, in his public character&mdash;that the great things he had done for the people over whom he ruled, were the fruit of a pious regard to GOD, and a firm belief in his promi&s;es.</P>
<P>RELIGION is of high importance in a ruler, as an incentive to fidelity, in the di&s;charge of the duties of his &s;tation&mdash;as it will lead him to &s;eek the direction and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Heaven&mdash;as it will afford him the be&s;t &s;upport under the bur|dens of his office, and cau&s;e him, by his precepts and example, to do much for the promotion of piety and virtue among the people.</P>
<P>GREAT abilities, through indolence and a love of ea&s;e, may lie u&s;ele&s;s in a ruler. The com|munity
<PB N="12" REF="030738_0011_0FE8D680AD3E0030">
will derive little or no benefit from them, unle&s;s he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a principle &s;uffi|ciently active to bring them into operation, and &s;ufficiently virtuous to direct their operation for the public good.</P>
<P>As &s;uperior talents in an exalted &s;tation render a man capable of doing &s;ignal &s;ervice for the community, &s;o they render him capable of doing as &s;ignal mi&s;chief. Nothing, like a prin|ciple of religion deeply imbibed in the heart, can &s;ecure him from the one, or prompt him to the other.</P>
<P>OTHER and lower principles, it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed, have influenced, and may influence, men to do many beneficial deeds for their nation, and greatly promote their quietne&s;s and pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>BUT the&s;e principles&mdash;&s;uch as honor, ambi|tion, a natural benevolence of temper, or a de|&s;ire of the continued enjoyment of the emolu|ment of a public office, are too contracted to reach many ca&s;es, with which the happine&s;s of &s;ociety is intimately and e&s;&s;entially connected, and have not that force requi&s;ite to produce an even, &s;teady and con&s;i&s;tent cour&s;e of action.</P>
<P>THE ruler, who is not under the prevailing influence of the fear and love of GOD, and that
<PB N="13" REF="030738_0012_0FE8D68832FFD110">
love of mankind which is an in&s;eparable con|comitant of the love of GOD, is always in dan|ger of betraying his tru&s;t, and involving the community in mi&s;ery and ruin. Temptations to do wrong, when they make a vigorous a&s;&s;ualt upon him (and none are more expo&s;ed to tempt|ations, than tho&s;e, who are in elevated &s;tations) will be likely to meet with a feeble, if any re&s;i&s;t|ance. He will not be deterred from a mea&s;ure however injurious it may be to individuals, or de&s;tructive in its tendency to the intere&s;t of his country, when, by going into it, he can gratify his avarice, or &s;ave him&s;elf from pre&s;ent infamy, and pre&s;erve the favour of a majority of his con|&s;tituents.</P>
<P>SUCH may frequently be the &s;ituation of things, that the civil ruler cannot, in conformity to the dictates of an enlightened under&s;tanding, and a benevolent heart, pur&s;ue &s;uch conduct, as will greatly conduce to the advantage of the community, without expo&s;ing him&s;elf to certain reproach, and hazarding the lo&s;s of his official exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>BUT he, and he only, who, regarding the prai&s;e of GOD more than the prai&s;e of men, is &s;olicitou&s;ly concerned to approve him&s;elf to that glorious BEING, who &s;tandeth in the congrega|tion of the mighty and judgeth among the Gods,
<PB N="14" REF="030738_0013_0FE8D689CA3E5C38">
is to be depended on in all &s;ea&s;ons. In &s;ea&s;ons the mo&s;t trying nothing can warp him from his duty. Having accepted an important tru&s;t, he is deeply concerned to di&s;charge it with all fidelity. He feels him&s;elf accountable to God, who&s;e eye is continually upon him. The fear of man, which bringeth a &s;nare, is &s;wallowed up by the greater fear of that great and terrible BEING, with whom are all the po&s;&s;ible cau&s;es, of life and death&mdash;of happine&s;s and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>CHARMED with the character of the DEITY who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity, and cannot look on &s;in, who&s;e goodne&s;s is his glory, he has an ardent de&s;ire to imitate it. In his official, as well as private capacity, he will feel an aver&s;ion to every thing immoral&mdash;every thing impure, unju&s;t, oppre&s;&s;ive and cruel&mdash;eve|ry thing that tends to the hurt of the public, or individuals. He will feel a di&s;po&s;ition to pro|mote, to his utmo&s;t, the comfort, the peace and happine&s;s of all men, with whom he has to do.</P>
<P>THE civil ruler, who is under the united in|fluence of this di&s;po&s;ition and the various pow|erful arguments and motives of religion, argu|ments and motives that re&s;pect both the pre&s;ent and the eternal world, will be a benefactor in|deed to his nation. He will not fail to attend to the duties of his &s;tation. He will take due
<PB N="15" REF="030738_0014_0FE8D691456A46B8">
pains to inform him&s;elf what is right and fit to be done, in every ca&s;e that comes under con&s;id|eration. He will not be backward to decide up|on it, according to the dictates of his con&s;cience, however &s;uch deci&s;ion may expo&s;e him to infamy and reproach. His fortitude and independence of &s;pirit will be in &s;ome good proportion to the &s;trength and vigor of his faith, in the great ob|jects of religion. "With him it is a very &s;mall thing that he &s;hould be judged of man's judg|ment. He that judgeth him is the LORD."</P>
<P>IN &s;ea&s;ons of darkne&s;s and perplexity, when it is not ea&s;y to know what ought to be done, the ruler, who is a man of religion, will be un|der &s;uperior advantages for forming a right judg|ment. In a humble &s;en&s;e of his dependance on GOD who is the father of lights, he will repair to him for all needed illumination. Encoura|ged by that direction and declaration in his word, "If any of you lack wi&s;dom, let him a&s;k of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and up|braideth not; and it &s;hall be given him," he waits upon him in hope of a gracious an&s;wer.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t able men know by experience, that the human mind is not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a principle of inerrability, but that it is liable to mi&s;take and err&mdash;that in things which relate to govern|ment, they frequently want wi&s;dom. The ru|ler,
<PB N="16" REF="030738_0015_0FE8D692D8D9D4E8">
who &s;eeks it of GOD, &s;urely, is more likely to determine wi&s;ely in difficult ca&s;es, than he, who refu&s;es to apply to him for direction and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. It is ea&s;y for that BEING, who formed the mind of man with all its powers and faculties, and has the mo&s;t intimate acce&s;s to it, &s;ecretly and imperceptibly to influence its operations, di|rect and a&s;&s;i&s;t its enquiries, and lead it into &s;uch views, as will e&s;&s;entially affect its determinations, without the lea&s;t infringement of its moral lib|erty. Tho&s;e, therefore, who tru&s;t &s;o far in their own wi&s;dom, as to neglect all application to HIM for coun&s;el and direction, act very irrationally, and are in danger, through the ju&s;t re&s;entment of HEAVEN, of having their boa&s;ted wi&s;dom turned into fooli&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P>RELIGION, in civil rulers, is of high import|ance, in re&s;pect to the influence they have, in forming the religious and moral character of the people. The character of the rulers of I&s;rael marked the &s;tate of religion in that nation. A &s;imilar influence may be looked for, from the di&s;po&s;ition and conduct of the rulers of every other people. It is an ob&s;ervation of Solomon, who was di&s;tingui&s;hed above all others for his wi&s;dom, If a ruler hearken to lies, all his &s;er|vants are wicked.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="030738_0016_0FE8D69A89107AF8">
EXPERIENCE evinces, that there is a peculiar propen&s;ity in per&s;ons in the lower walks of life, to imitate tho&s;e, who are in places of eminence and dignity. When this propen&s;ity, by means of the corrupt practices of great men, is led to co-operate with another, which is natural to all, I mean an inclination to do evil, what an inun|dation of wickedne&s;s is to be expected?</P>
<P>THE ruler, who allows him&s;elf in prophaning the name of GOD&mdash;in treating the In&s;titutions of religion with neglect, irreverence and con|tempt&mdash;in violating the laws of righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;obriety, cha&s;tity and temperance, though he &s;hould be active in framing and enacting laws, for encouraging piety and virtue, and for di&s;|countenancing and &s;uppre&s;&s;ing vice and irreli|gion, takes the mo&s;t effectual method to defeat the good tendency of &s;uch laws, and &s;pread cor|ruption far and wide.</P>
<P>HE only who enforceth his precepts by his ex|ample, whether he be the head of a private fam|ily, or the ruler of a larger &s;ociety, can ration|ally expect that his precepts will be much re|garded. Religion will be likely to flouri&s;h, or decline, among a people, according as it is treat|ed by men in con&s;picuous places. Their eleva|ted &s;tation gives a lu&s;tre to their example, which
<PB N="18" REF="030738_0017_0FE8D69C859EEB48">
will not fail to produce a great and exten&s;ive effect. What regard then, ought to be had to the moral and religious character of per&s;ons, who are candidates for any important office, by tho&s;e to whom it belongs to elect them!</P>
<P>THE civil ruler, who is a man of piety and virtue, &s;en&s;ible that he cannot be a good ruler, any further than he is a benefactor to the peo|ple, will con&s;ult and pur&s;ue their true intere&s;t, by every ju&s;t and rea&s;onable method in his pow|er. Knowing by experience, the &s;alutary effect of religion upon his own temper and conduct, convinced of the nece&s;&s;ity of it in order to the happine&s;s of others, viewing in a &s;trong point of light, the benign a&s;pect of the chri&s;tian reli|gion, on the liberty and order, the peace and pro&s;perity of the community, he will ever be ready to recommend it, and u&s;e the whole of his influence to encourage its profe&s;&s;ion and practice. The good ruler will cheerfully give his a&s;&s;ent to laws calculated to promote the education of youth in virtue and knowledge, and the train|ing them up for public u&s;efulne&s;s in the Church and State; and which will mo&s;t effectually pro|vide for the &s;upport of public wor&s;hip and in|&s;truction, and are friendly to the general diffu|&s;ion of knowledge and true religion. Nothing
<PB N="19" REF="030738_0018_0FE8D6A3F97682A0">
will di&s;courage him from adopting and per&s;ever|ing in &s;uch mea&s;ures as appear to him, on ma|ture deliberation, nece&s;&s;ary, and the be&s;t adapt|ed to encourage and promote righteou&s;ne&s;s, which exalteth a nation, and di&s;countenance &s;in which is a reproach to any people. What &s;at|isfaction mu&s;t the ruler of this character, who has been in&s;trumental of great good to his peo|ple, have in reflecting on his pa&s;t conduct, and the happy fruit of his beneficent labors?</P>
<P>BUT, &s;hould his faithful &s;ervices for the pub|lic, his tried patrioti&s;m, his inflexible regard to the intere&s;t of his country be forgotten&mdash;&s;hould he be neglected, and treated with infamy, by tho&s;e of whom he has de&s;erved well, what a &s;ource of comfort will he have in the te&s;timony of his own con&s;cience to his integrity? And, with what plea&s;ure, may he look forward to that day, when the &s;ecret motives of his conduct &s;hall be laid open and applauded, with all his worthy deeds, by the Judge of all, in the pre&s;ence of the whole world?</P>
<P>THOUGH he is deeply &s;en&s;ible of his many im|perfections, and that had he done all that was required of him, he would have been an unprofit|able &s;ervant, having done no more than was his duty to do, yet, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a character, formed
<PB N="20" REF="030738_0019_0FE8D6A58F2D7F80">
thro' the influence of the divine word and &s;pirit, a character, to which the promi&s;e of eternal life, thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is made by the infinitely glo|rious and faithful GOD, he may well rejoice in hope of all that glory and felicity, with which the righteous &s;hall be remunerated in the world to come.</P>
<P>BUT, &s;hould the faithful ruler receive no di&s;|agreeable treatment from tho&s;e who&s;e peace and pro&s;perity lie near his heart&mdash;&s;hould his &s;ervices meet the approbation, and be rewarded with the grateful acknowledgements, of the multitude of his fellow citizens, yet there is a trying &s;ea&s;on approaching, from which none are exempt|ed, even of tho&s;e among men, who are &s;tiled Gods. It is a declaration of &s;cripture, which the experience of all pa&s;t ages has verified, "I &s;aid ye are Gods; but ye &s;hall die like men." In the near pro&s;pect of his di&s;&s;olution, what com|fort mu&s;t it afford the pious ruler to be able to &s;ay, "Remember, O LORD, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy &s;ight."</P>
<P>THIS State, ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, has been di&s;tin|gui&s;hed with rulers of this character, who in &s;ea&s;ons that try &s;ouls, have exhibited the mo&s;t undoubted evidence of their firm and un&s;haken attachment to the cau&s;e of truth and righteou&s;|ne&s;s
<PB N="21" REF="030738_0020_0FE8D6AD74C03620">

<P>BY his public profe&s;&s;ion of religion, for many years, his &s;teady attendance on the in&s;titutions of chri&s;tianity, and his exemplary good conver&s;a|tion, GOVERNOR HUNTINGTON made it mani|fe&s;t to all, that he was not a&s;hamed of the Go&s;pel of CHRIST.</P>
<P>THE various important public &s;tations into which he was &s;ucce&s;&s;ively cho&s;en, he &s;u&s;tained with dignity, and di&s;played &s;uch ability, prudence and integrity in the di&s;charge of them, as met with great acceptance from the multitude of his brethren.</P>

<P>THE remarkable unanimity, with which his late EXCELLENCY was re-cho&s;en, from year to year, to fill the chair, exhibits an evidence, not only of the general approbation, but of the wi&s;|dom and equity of his admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>THE &s;atifaction re&s;ulting from the continued approbation and acceptance of his &s;ervices, by his fellow citizens, however great, mu&s;t have been a &s;mall thing with him, in the near view of his departure, compared with the joy ari&s;ing from the te&s;timony of his con&s;cience, that in &s;im|plicity and godly &s;incerity, not with fle&s;hly wi&s;|dom, but by the grace of God, he had di&s;char|ged the duties of the &s;everal relations in which he had been placed.</P>

<P>WHEN rulers, of &s;uch a character, are taken away, e&s;pecially, in times of growing infidelity and corruption, the people have great rea&s;on to mourn, not for them, but for them&s;elves and their children; and may well exclaim, "Help, LORD, for the godly man cea&s;eth; for the faith|ful fail from among the children of men."</P>
<P>MAY &s;urviving rulers and officers of every grade, be deeply impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of the high importance of approving them&s;elves to GOD, in the whole of their conduct.
