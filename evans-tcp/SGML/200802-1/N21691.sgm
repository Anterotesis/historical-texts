<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF LITTLE JACK.</HEAD>
<P>THERE was once a poor lame old man that lived in the mid&s;t of a wide uncultivated moor, in the north of England. He had for|merly been a &s;oldier, and had almo&s;t lo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> u&s;e of one leg by a wound he had received in battle, when he was fighting again&s;t the enemies of his country This poor man, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e found him&s;elf thus di&s;abled, built a little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut of clay, which he covered with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> dug <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">om the common.

his own hands; and which &s;upplied him with potatoes and vegetables; be&s;ides this, he &s;ome|times gained a few halfpence by opening a gate for travellers, which &s;tood near his hou&s;e. He did not indeed get much, becau&s;e few people pa&s;&s;ed that way. What he earned was, how|ever, enough to purcha&s;e cloaths, and the few nece&s;&s;aries he wanted. But though poor, he was &s;trictly hone&s;t, and never failed night and morning to addre&s;s his prayers to God; by which means he was re&s;pected by all who knew him, much more than many who were &s;uperior to him in rank and fortune. This old man had one dome&s;tic. In his walks over the com|mon, he one day found a little kid that had lo&s;t its mother, and was almo&s;t fami&s;hed with hunger: he took it home to his cottage, fed it with the produce of his garden, and nur&s;ed it till it grew &s;trong and vigorous. Little Nan, (for that was the name he gave it) returned his cares with gratitude, and became as much at|tached to him as a dog. All day &s;he browzed upon the herbage that grew around his hut, and at night repo&s;ed upon the &s;ame bed of &s;traw with her ma&s;ter. Frequently did &s;he divert him with her innocent tricks and gambols. She would ne&s;tle her little head in his bo&s;om, and eat out of his hand part of his &s;canty al|lowance of bread; which he never failed to divide with his favourite. The old man often beheld her with &s;ilent joy, and, in the inno|cent effu&s;ions of his heart, would lift his hand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to heaven, and thank the Deity, that, even in the mid&s;t of poverty and di&s;tre&s;s, had rai&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> him up one faithful friend.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="028539_0004_0FD938C2C7C86A98">One night, in the beginning of winter, the old man thought he heard the feeble cries and lamentations of a child. As he was naturally charitable, he aro&s;e and &s;truck a light, and, going out of his cottage, examined on every &s;ide: It was not long before he di&s;cerned an infant, which had probably been dropped by &s;ome &s;trolling beggar or gyp&s;y. The old man &s;tood amazed at the &s;ight, and knew not what to do. Shall I, &s;aid he, who find it &s;o diffi|cult to live at pre&s;ent, incumber my&s;elf with the care of an helple&s;s infant, that will not for many years be capable of contributing to its own &s;ub&s;i&s;tence? And yet, added he, &s;oftening with pity, can I deny a&s;&s;i&s;tance to an human being &s;till more mi&s;erable than my&s;elf?&mdash;Will not that Providence which feeds the birds of the wood and the bea&s;ts of the field, and which has promi&s;ed to ble&s;s all tho&s;e that are kind and charitable, a&s;&s;i&s;t my feeble endeavours?&mdash;At lea&s;t, let me give it food and lodging for this night; for without I receive it into my cot|tage, the poor abandoned wretch mu&s;t peri&s;h with cold before the morning. Saying th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&punc; he took it up in his arms, and perceived it was a fine healthy boy, though covered with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the little foundling too &s;eemed to be &s;en&s;ible <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> his kindne&s;s, and &s;miling in his face, &s;tret<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ed out his little arms, as if to embra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">enefactor.</P>
<P>When he had brought it into his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">egan to be extremely embarra&s;&s;ed how to pro|cure it food: but looking at Nan, he recol|lected that &s;he had ju&s;t lo&s;t her kid, and &s;aw her udder di&s;tended with milk: he, therefore,
<PB N="4" REF="028539_0005_0FD938C740D97010">
called her to him, and, pre&s;enting the child to the teat, was overjoyed to find, that it &s;ucked as naturally as if it had really found a mother. The goat too &s;eemed to receive plea&s;ure from the efforts of the child, and &s;ubmitted without oppo&s;ition to di&s;charge the duties of a nur&s;e. Contented with this experiment, the old man wrapped the child up as warmly as he could, and &s;tretched him&s;elf out to re&s;t with the con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having done an humane action. Early the next morning he was awakened by the cries of the child for food, which with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his faithful Nan, he &s;uckled as he had done the night before. And now the old man began to feel an intere&s;t in the child, which made him defer &s;ome time longer the taking mea&s;ures to be delivered from its care. Who knows, &s;aid he, but Providence which has pre|&s;erved this child in &s;o wonderful a manner, may have de&s;tined it to &s;omething equally won|derful in his future life; and may ble&s;s me as the humble agent of his decrees? At lea&s;t, as he grows bigger, he will be a plea&s;ure and comfort to me, in this lonely cabin, and will a&s;&s;i&s;t in cutting turf for fuel, and cultivating the gar|den. From this time he became more and more attached to the little foundling; who, in a &s;hort time, learned to con&s;ider the old man as a pa|rent, and delighted him with its innocent ca|re&s;&s;es. Gentle Nanny too, the goat, &s;eemed to adopt him with equal tenderne&s;s as her off|&s;pring: &s;he would &s;tretch her&s;elf out upon th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ground, while he crawled upon his hands and knees towards her; and when he had &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">
<PB N="5" REF="028539_0006_0FD938C87AA605D8">
his hunger by &s;ucking, he would ne&s;tle between her legs and go to &s;leep in her bo&s;om.</P>
<P>It was wonderful to &s;ee how this child, thus left to nature, increa&s;ed in &s;trength and vigour. Unfettered by bandages or re&s;traints, his limbs acquired their due proportions and form; his countenance was full and florid, and gave indi|cations of perfect health; and, at an age when other children are &s;carcely able to &s;upport them|&s;elves with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a nur&s;e, this little foundling could run alone. It was true, that he &s;ometimes failed in his attempts, and fell to the ground; but the ground was &s;oft, and little Jack, for &s;o the old man called him, was not tender or delicate; he never minded thumps or brui&s;es, but boldly &s;crambled up again and pur|&s;ued his way. In a &s;hort time, little Jack was completely ma&s;ter of his legs; and as the &s;um|mer came on, he attended his mamma, the

<PB N="6" REF="028539_0007_0FD938C9963A6630">
goat, upon the common, and u&s;ed to play with her for hours together; &s;ometimes rolling under her belly, now climbing upon her back, and fri&s;king about as if he had really been a kid. As to his cloathing, Jack was not much incum|bered with it; he had neither &s;hoes, nor &s;tock|ings, nor &s;hirt; but the weather was warm, and Jack felt him&s;elf &s;o much lighter for every kind of exerci&s;e. In a &s;hort time after this, Jack began to imitate the &s;ounds of his papa the man, and his mamma the goat; nor was it long before he learned to &s;peak articulately. The old man delighted with this fir&s;t dawn of rea&s;on, u&s;ed to place him upon his knee, and conver&s;e with him for hours together, while his pottage was &s;lowly boiling amid the embers of a turf fire. As he grew bigger, Jack became of con&s;ider|able u&s;e to his father; he could tru&s;t him to look after the gate, and open it during his ab|&s;ence: and, as to the cookery of the family, it was not long before Jack was a complete pro|ficient, and could make broth almo&s;t as well as his daddy him&s;elf. During the winter nights, the old man u&s;ed to entertain him with &s;tories of what he had &s;een during his youth; the battles and &s;ieges he had been witne&s;s to, and the hard&s;hips he had undergone; all this he related with &s;o much vivacity that Jack was never tired of li&s;tening. But what delighted him beyond mea&s;ure was to &s;ee daddy &s;houlder his crutch, in&s;tead of a mu&s;ket, and give the word of command. To the right&mdash;to the le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &mdash;pre&s;ent&mdash;fire&mdash;march&mdash;halt&mdash;all this w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> familiar to Jack's ear as &s;oon as he could &s;peak&punc; and before he was &s;ix years old, he poized and

pre&s;ented a broom-&s;tick, which his daddy gave him for that purpo&s;e, with as good a grace as any &s;oldier of his age in Europe.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>The old man too in&s;tructed him in &s;uch plain and &s;imple morals and religion, as he was able to explain. "Never tell an untruth, Jack, &s;aid he, even though you were to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> alive; a &s;oldier never lies." Jack held up his head, marched acro&s;s the floor, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> his daddy that he would always tell the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> like a &s;oldier. But the old man, as he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as &s;omething of a &s;cholar, had a great ambition that his darling &s;hould learn to read, and write; and this was a work of &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ulty; for he had neither printed book, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, nor paper in his cabin. Indu&s;try, how|ever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> enables us to overcome difficulties, in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> time, as the old man &s;at before his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> he would draw letters in the &s;and, and
<PB N="8" REF="028539_0009_0FD938D55FA88DA0">
teach Jack to name them &s;ingly, until he was acquainted with the whole alphabet, he then proceeded to &s;yllables; and after that to words; all which his little pupil learned to pronounce with great facility: and, as he had a &s;trong propen&s;ity to imitate what he &s;aw, he not only acquired the power of reading words, but of tracing all the letters which compo&s;ed them, on the &s;and.</P>
<P>About this time, the poor goat which had nur&s;ed Jack &s;o faithfully, grew ill and died. He tended her with the greate&s;t affection and a&s;&s;iduity during her illne&s;s, brought her the fre&s;he&s;t herbs for food, and would frequently &s;upport her head for hours together upon his little bo&s;om. But it was all in vain; he lo&s;t his poor mammy, as he u&s;ed to call her, and was for &s;ome time incon&s;olable; for Jack, though his knowledge was bounded, had an uncommon degree of gratitude and affection in his temper. He was not able to talk as finely about love, tenderne&s;s, and &s;en&s;ibility, as many other little boys, that have enjoyed greater ad|vantages of education; but he felt the reality of them in his heart, and thought it &s;o natural to love every thing that loves us, that he never even &s;u&s;pected it was po&s;&s;ible to do otherwi&s;e. The poor goat was buried in the old man's garden, and thither little Jack would often come and call upon his poor mammy Nan, and a&s;k her why &s;he had left him? One day, as he was thus employed, a lady happened to come by in a carriage, and overheard him before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> was aware. Jack ran in an in&s;tant to open <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="9" REF="028539_0010_0FD938D64730B2C0">
gate; but the lady &s;topped, and a&s;ked him whom he was bemoaning &s;o pitifully, and calling

</FIGURE>
upon? Jack an&s;wered, that it was his poor mammy, that was buried in the garden. The lady thought it very odd to hear of &s;uch a bu|rial place, and therefore proceeded to que&s;tion him, "How did your mammy get her living?" &s;aid &s;he. "She u&s;ed to graze here upon the common all day long," &s;aid Jack. The lady was &s;till more a&s;toni&s;hed; but the old man came out of his hut, and explained the whole affair to her, which &s;urpri&s;ed her very much; for though this lady had &s;een a great deal of the world, and had read a variety of books, it had ne|ver once entered into her head that a child might grow &s;trong and vigorous by &s;ucking a goat, in&s;tead of eating pap. She therefore looked at Jack with amazement, admired his brown but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ted face, and prai&s;ed his &s;hape and acti|vity.
<PB N="10" REF="028539_0011_0FD938DD1E1A0630">
"Will you go with me, little boy, &s;aid &s;he, and I will take care of you, if you behave well?" "No, &s;aid Jack, I mu&s;t &s;tay with daddy; he has taken care of me for many years, and now I mu&s;t take care of him; otherwi&s;e I &s;hould like very well to go with &s;uch a &s;weet, good-natured lady." The lady was not di&s;plea&s;ed with Jack's an&s;wer, and putting her hand in her pocket, gave him half a crown, to buy him &s;hoes and &s;tockings, and pur&s;ued her jour|ney.</P>
<P>Jack was not unacquainted with the u&s;e of money, as he had been often &s;ent to the next village to purcha&s;e bread and nece&s;&s;aries; but he was totally unacquainted with the u&s;e of &s;hoes and &s;tockings, which he had never worn in his life, or felt the want of. The next day, however, the old man bade him run to town, and lay his money out as the lady had de&s;ired; for he had too much honour to think of di&s;obeying her commands, or &s;uffering it to be expended for any other purpo&s;e. It was not long before Jack returned; but the old man was much &s;ur|pri&s;ed to &s;ee him come back as bare as he went out. "Heigh, Jack! &s;aid he, where are the &s;hoes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd &s;tockings which you were to pur|cha&s;e?" "Daddy, an&s;wered Jack, I went to the &s;hop, and ju&s;t tried a pair for &s;port, but I found them &s;o cumber&s;ome, that I could not walk, and I would not wear &s;uch things, even if the lady would give me another half cro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> for doing it; &s;o I laid the money out in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> warm jacket for you, becau&s;e the winter i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> coming on, and you &s;eem to be more afraid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the cold than formerly."

If conduct did Jack di&s;play; from which it was ea&s;y to perceive, that he had an excellent &s;oul, and generous temper. One failing, in|deed Jack was liable to; though a very good natured boy, he was a little too jealous of his honour. His daddy had taught him the u&s;e of his hands and legs, and Jack had &s;uch di&s;po&s;i|tions for the art of boxing, that he could beat every boy in the neighbourhood, of his age and &s;ize. Even if they were a head taller, it made no difference to Jack, provided they &s;aid any thing to wound his honour; for otherwi&s;e he was the mo&s;t mild, pacific creature in the world. One day that he had been &s;ent to the village, he returned with his eyes black, and his face &s;welled to a frightful &s;ize: it was even with difficulty that he was able to walk at all, &s;o &s;ore was he with the pomelling he had receiv|ed. "What have you been doing now, Jack?" &s;aid the old man.&mdash;"Only fighting with Dick the butcher." "You rogue, &s;aid the old man, he is twice as big as you are, and the be&s;t fighter in all the country." "What does that &s;ignify, &s;aid Jack, he called you an old beggarman, and then I &s;truck him; and I will &s;trike him again whenever he calls you &s;o, even if he &s;hould beat me to pieces; for you know, daddy, that you are not a beggarman, but a &s;oldier."</P>
<P>In this manner lived little Jack, until he was twelve years old; at this time his poor old daddy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ick and became incapable of moving about. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> did every thing he could think of for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> man; he made him broths, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> his own hands, he watched whole nights <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> his bed-&s;ide &s;upporting his head and helping

him when he wanted to move. But it was all in vain; his poor daddy grew daily wor&s;e, and perceived it to be impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould re|cover. He one day therefore called little Jack to his bed-&s;ide, and pre&s;&s;ing his hand affection|ately, told him that he was ju&s;t going to die. Little Jack bur&s;t into a flood of tears at this information, but his daddy de&s;ired him to compo&s;e him&s;elf, and attend to the la&s;t advice
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
he &s;hould be able to give him. "I have lived, &s;aid the old man, a great many years, in po|verty, but I do not know that I have been wor&s;e off than if I had been rich. I have avoided, perhaps, many faults, and many unea&s;ine&s;&s;es, which I &s;hould have incurred had I been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> another &s;ituation; and though I have often wanted a meal and always fared hard, I h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> enjoyed as much health and life as u&s;ually fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the lot of my betters.

die; I feel it in every part; the breath will &s;oon be out of my body; then I &s;hall be put in the ground, and the worms will eat your poor old daddy." At this Jack renewed his tears and &s;obbings, for he was unable to re&s;train them. But the old man &s;aid; "Have patience, my child; though I &s;hould leave this world, as I have always been &s;trictly hone&s;t and endea|voured to do my duty, I do not doubt but God will pity me, and convey me to a better place; where I &s;hall be happier than I have ever been here. This is what I have always taught you, and this belief gives me the greate&s;t comfort in my la&s;t moments. The only regret I feel, is for you, my deare&s;t child, whom I leave unprovi|ded for. But you are &s;trong and vigorous, and almo&s;t able to get your living. As &s;oon as I am dead, you mu&s;t go to the next village and inform the people, that they may come and bury me. You mu&s;t then endeavour to get into &s;ervice, and work for your living; and, if you are &s;trictly hone&s;t and &s;ober, I do not doubt that you will find a livelihood, and that God, who is the common father of all, will protect and ble&s;s you. Adieu, my child, I grow faint|er and fainter; never forget your poor old daddy, nor the example he has &s;et you; but in every &s;ituation of life di&s;charge your duty, and live like a Soldier, and a Chri&s;tian." When the old man had with difficulty uttered the&s;e la&s;t in&s;tructions, his voice entirely failed him, his limbs grew cold and &s;tiff, and in a few mi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">utes he expired without a groan. Little Jack, who hung crying over his daddy, called upon him&punc; in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ain, in vain endeavoured to revive
<PB N="14" REF="028539_0015_0FD938EAF36BF4A8">
him. At length he pulled off his cloaths, went into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s daddy's bed, and endeavoured for many hours to animate him with the warmth of his own body; but finding all his endeavours fruit|le&s;s, he concluded that he was indeed dead; and therefore, weeping bitterly, he dre&s;t him|&s;elf, and went to the village as he had been or|dered. The poor little boy was thus left en|tirely de&s;titute and knew not what to do; but one of the farmers, who had been acquainted with him before, offered to take him into his hou&s;e, and give him his victuals, for a few months, till he could find a &s;ervice. Jack thankfully accepted the offer, and &s;erved him faithfully for &s;everal months; during which time he learned to milk, to drive the plough, and never refu&s;ed any kind of work he was able to perform. But, by ill luck, this good-natu|red farmer contracted a fever, by over-heating him&s;elf in the harve&s;t, and died in the begin|ning of winter. His wife was therefore obliged to di&s;charge her &s;ervants, and Jack was again turned loo&s;e upon the world, with only his cloaths, and a &s;hilling in his pocket, which his kind mi&s;tre&s;s had made him a pre&s;ent of.

a mor&s;el of bread to eat. Jack, however, was not of a temper to be ea&s;ily ca&s;t down; he walk|ed re&s;olutely on all day, but towards evening was overtaken by a violent &s;torm of rain, which wetted him to the &s;kin before he could find a bu&s;h for &s;helter. Now, poor Jack began to think of his old daddy, and the comforts he had formerly enjoyed upon the common, where he had always a roof to &s;helter him, and a &s;lice of bread for &s;upper. But tears and lamenta|tions were vain; and therefore, as &s;oon as the &s;torm was over, he pur&s;ued his journey, in hopes of finding &s;ome barn or out-hou&s;e to creep into for the re&s;t of the night. While he was thus wandering about, he &s;aw at &s;ome di&s;|tance a great light, which &s;eemed to come from &s;ome prodigious fire. Jack did not know what this could be; but, in his pre&s;ent &s;itua|tion, he thought a fire no di&s;agreeable object, and therefore determined to approach it. When he came nearer, he &s;aw a large build|ing which &s;eemed to &s;pout fire and &s;moke at &s;everal openings, and heard an ince&s;&s;ant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of blows, and the rattling of chains. Jack was at fir&s;t a little frightened, but &s;ummoning all his courage, he crept cautiou&s;ly on to the building, and looking through a chink, di&s;co|vered &s;everal men and boys employed in blow|ing fires and hammering burning ma&s;&s;es of it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m.

roughly, what bu&s;ine&s;s he had there? Jack an|&s;wered with great humility, that he was a poor boy, looking out for work; that he had had no food all day, and was wet to the &s;kin with the rain, which was evident enough from the appearance of his cloaths. By great good luck, the man he &s;poke to was good natured, and therefore not only permitted him to &s;tay by the fire, but gave him &s;ome broken victuals for his &s;upper. After this, he laid him&s;elf down in a corner, and &s;lept without di&s;turbance till morning. He was &s;carcely awake the next day, when the ma&s;ter of the forge came in to overlook his men, who finding Jack, and hear|ing his &s;tory, began to reproach him as a la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> vagabond, and a&s;ked him why he did not wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for his living.

that he would not do to earn a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Well, my boy, &s;aid the ma&s;ter, if this is true, you &s;hall &s;oon be tried; nobody need be idle here; &s;o calling his foreman, he ordered him to &s;et that lad to work, and pay him in pro|portion to his de&s;erts. Jack now thought him|&s;elf completely happy, and worked with &s;o much a&s;&s;iduity, that he &s;oon gained a com|fortable livelihood, and acquired the e&s;teem of his ma&s;ter. But unfortunately, he was a little too unre&s;erved in his conver&s;ation, and com|municated the &s;tory of his former life and edu|cation. This was great matter of diver&s;ion to all the other boys of the forge; who, when|ever they were inclined to be merry, would call him little Jack the beggar-boy, and imi|tate the baaing of a goat. This was too much for his ira&s;cible temper, and he never failed to re&s;ent it; by which means he was engaged in continual quarrels and combats, to the great di&s;turbance of the hou&s;e; &s;o that his ma&s;ter, though in other re&s;pects perfectly &s;atisfied with his behaviour, began to fear that he &s;hould at la&s;t be obliged to di&s;charge him.</P>
<P>It happened one day, that a large company of gentlemen and ladies were introduced to &s;ee the works. The ma&s;ter attended them, and explained, with great politene&s;s, every part of his manufacture. They viewed with a&s;toni&s;h|ment the different methods by which that u&s;e|ful and nece&s;&s;ary ore of iron is rendered fit for human u&s;e. They examined the furnaces where it is melted down, to di&s;engage it from the dre&s;s, with which it is mixed in the bowels of the earth, and whence it runs down in liquid

torrents like fire. They beheld with equal plea|&s;ure the prodigious hammers which, moved by the force of water, mould it into ma&s;&s;y bars, for the &s;ervice of man. While they were bu&s;y in examining the&s;e different proce&s;&s;es, they were alarmed by a &s;udden noi&s;e of di&s;cord, which broke out on the other &s;ide of the build|ing; and the ma&s;ter inquiring into the cau&s;e, was told, that it was only little Jack, who was fighting with Tom the collier. At this, the ma&s;ter cried out, in a pa&s;&s;ion, there is no peace to be expected in the furnace, while that little ra&s;cal is employed; &s;end him to me, and I will in&s;tantly di&s;charge him. At this moment Jack appeared, all covered with blood and dirt, and &s;tood before his angry judge in a mode&s;t, but re&s;olute po&s;ture. "Is this the reward, &s;aid his ma&s;ter, you little audacious vagabond, of all my kindne&s;s? Can you never refrain a &s;ingle in|&s;tant

from broils and fighting? But I am deter|mined to bear it no longer; and therefore you &s;hall never, from this hour, do a &s;ingle &s;troke of work for me." "Sir, replied Jack, with great humility, but yet with firmne&s;s, I am extremely &s;orry to have di&s;obliged you, nor have I ever done it willingly, &s;ince I have been here; and if the other boys would only mind their bu&s;ine&s;s as well as I do, and not mole&s;t me, you would not have been offended now; for I defy them all to &s;ay, that &s;ince I have been in the hou&s;e, I have ever given any one the lea&s;t provocation, or ever refu&s;ed to the utmo&s;t of my &s;trength, to do whatever I have been ordered." "That's true, in good faith, &s;aid the foreman; I mu&s;t do little Jack the ju&s;tice to &s;ay that there is not a more hone&s;t, &s;ober, and indu&s;trious lad about the place. Set him to what you will, he never &s;culks, never grumbles, never &s;lights his work;

and if it were not for a little pa&s;&s;ion and fight|ing, I don't believe there would be his fellow in England." "Well, &s;aid the ma&s;ter a little molli|fied, but what is the cau&s;e of all this &s;udden di&s;|turbance?" "Sir, an&s;wered Jack, it is Tom that has been abu&s;ing me and telling me that my fa|ther was a beggarman and my mother a nanny-goat; and when I de&s;ired him to be quiet, he went baaing all about the hou&s;e; and this I could not bear; for as to my poor father he was an hone&s;t &s;oldier, and if I did &s;uck a goat, &s;he was the be&s;t creature in the world, and I won't hear her abu&s;ed while I have any &s;trength in my body." At this harangue, the whole audience were &s;carcely able to refrain from laughing, and the ma&s;ter, with more compo&s;ure, told Jack to mind his bu&s;ine&s;s, and threatened the other boys with puni&s;hment, if they di&s;turbed him.</P>
<P>But a lady who was in company &s;eemed par|ticularly intere&s;ted about little Jack, and when &s;he had heard his &s;tory, &s;aid, this mu&s;t certainly be the little boy who opened a gate &s;everal years pa&s;t for me upon Norcot Moor. I remember being &s;truck with his appearance, and hearing him lament the lo&s;s of the goat that nur&s;ed him. I was very much affected with his hi&s;|tory, and &s;ince he de&s;erves &s;o good a character, if you will part with him, I will in&s;tantly take him into my &s;ervice. The ma&s;ter replied, that he &s;hould part with him with great &s;atisfaction to &s;uch an excellent mi&s;tre&s;s; that indeed the boy de&s;erved all the commend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tions which had been given; but &s;ince the other lads had &s;uch an habit of plaguing, and Jack was of &s;o impa|tient a temper, he de&s;paired of ever compo&s;ing
<PB N="21" REF="028539_0022_0FD938FD39B7E100">
their animo&s;ities. Jack was then called, and informed of the lady's offer, which he in&s;tantly accepted with the greate&s;t readine&s;s, and re|ceived immediate directions to her hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Jack was now in a new &s;phere of life. His face was wa&s;hed, his hair combed, he was clo|thed afre&s;h, and appeared a very &s;mart active lad. His bu&s;ine&s;s was, to help in the &s;table, to water the hor&s;es, to clean &s;hoes, to perform errands, and to do all the jobs of the family; and in the di&s;charge of the&s;e &s;ervices, he &s;oon gave univer&s;al &s;atisfaction. He was inde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ati|gable in doing what he was ordered, never grum|bled, or appeared out of temper, and &s;eemed &s;o quiet and inoffen&s;ive in his manners, that every body wondered how he had acquired the cha|racter of being quarrel&s;ome. In a &s;hort time, he became both the favourite and the drudge of the whole family; for, &s;peak but kindly to him and call him a little &s;oldier, and Jack was at every one's di&s;po&s;al. This was Jack's par|ticular foible and vanity; at his lei&s;ure hours, he would divert him&s;elf by the hour together, in poizing a dung fork, charging with a broom &s;tick, and &s;tanding centry at the &s;table door. Another propen&s;ity of Jack's, which now di&s;|covered it&s;elf, was an immoderate love of hor&s;es. The in&s;tant he was introduced into the &s;table, he attached him&s;elf &s;o &s;trongly to the&s;e animals, that you would have taken him for one of the &s;ame &s;pecies, or at lea&s;t a near rela|tion. Jack was never tired with rubbing down and carrying them; the coachman had &s;carcely any bu&s;ine&s;s but to &s;it upon his box; all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">perations of the &s;table were intru&s;ted to little
<PB N="22" REF="028539_0023_0FD939048CD25558">
Jack, nor was it ever known that he neglected a &s;ingle particular. But what gave him more plea&s;ure than all the re&s;t, was &s;ometimes to ac|company his mi&s;tre&s;s upon a little hor&s;e, which he managed with infinite dexterit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc;</P>
<P>Jack too di&s;covered a great di&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion for all the u&s;eful and mechanic arts. He had &s;erved an apprentice&s;hip already to the manufactory of iron, and of this he was almo&s;t as vain as being a &s;oldier. As he began to extend his know|ledge of the world, he &s;aw that nothing could be done without iron. How would you plough the ground, &s;aid Jack; how would you dig your garden; how would you even light a fire, dre&s;s a dinner, &s;hoe a hor&s;e, or do the lea&s;t thing in the world, if we workmen at the forge did not take the trouble of preparing it for you? Thus Jack would &s;ometimes expatiate upon the dignity and importance of his own profe&s;&s;ion, to the great admiration of all the other &s;er|vants.</P>
<P>The&s;e ideas naturally gave Jack a great e&s;teem for the profe&s;&s;ion of a black&s;mith, and in his occa&s;ional vi&s;its to the forge with the hor&s;es, he learnt to make and fix a &s;hoe as neatly as any arti&s;t in the country.</P>
<P>Nor were Jack's talents confined to the ma|nufactory of iron; his love of hor&s;es was &s;o great, and his intere&s;t in every thing that rela|ted to them, that it was not long before he acquired a very competent knowledge in the ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of &s;addlery.</P>
<P>Jack would al&s;o &s;ometimes ob&s;erve the car|penters when they were at work, and &s;ometime<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by &s;tealth attempt the management of thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

tools; in which he &s;ucceeded as well as in every thing el&s;e; &s;o that he was looked upon by every body as a very active, ingenious boy.</P>
<P>There was in the family, where he now lived, a young gentleman, the nephew of his mi&s;tre&s;s, who had lo&s;t his parents, and was therefore brought up by his aunt. As Ma&s;ter Willets was &s;omething younger than Jack, and a very good-natured boy, he &s;oon began to take notice of him, and be much diverted with his com|pany. Jack, indeed, was not unde&s;erving this attention; for although he could not boa&s;t any great advantages of education, his conduct was entirely free from all the vices to which &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the lower cla&s;s of people are &s;ubject. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">span <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ever heard to &s;wear, or expre&s;s him&s;elf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> any indecency.

to the animals entru&s;ted to his care, he not only refrained from u&s;ing them ill, but was never tired with doing them good offices. Add|ed to this, he was &s;ober, temperate, hardy, active, and ingenious, and de&s;pi&s;ed a lie as much as any of his betters. Ma&s;ter Willets now began to be much plea&s;ed with playing at cric|ket and trap-ball with Jack, who excelled at both the&s;e games. Ma&s;ter Willets had a little hor&s;e which Jack looked after; and not con|tented with looking after him in the be&s;t man|ner, he u&s;ed to ride him at his lei&s;ure hours with &s;o much care and addre&s;s, that in a &s;hort time he made him the mo&s;t gentle and docile little animal in the country. Jack had acquired this knowledge partly from his own experience, and partly from paying particular attention to an itinerant riding-ma&s;ter that had lately ex|hibited various feats in that neighbourhood. Jack attended him &s;o clo&s;ely, and made &s;o good

<PB N="25" REF="028539_0026_0FD9390BA2877A40">
an u&s;e of his time, that he learned to imitate almo&s;t every thing he &s;aw, and u&s;ed to divert the &s;ervants and his young ma&s;ter with acting the tailor's riding to Brentford.</P>
<P>The young gentleman had a ma&s;ter who u&s;ed to come three times a week to teach him ac|counts, and writing, and geography. Jack u&s;ed to be &s;ometimes in the room while the le&s;&s;ons were given, and li&s;tened according to cu&s;tom with &s;o much attention to all that pa&s;s|ed, that he received very con&s;iderable advan|tage for his own improvement. He had now a little money, and he laid &s;ome of it out to pur|cha&s;e pens and paper and a &s;late, with which at night he u&s;ed to imitate every thing he had heard and &s;een in the day: and his little ma&s;|ter, who began to love him very &s;incerely, when he &s;aw him &s;o de&s;irous of improvement, con|trived, under one pretence or another, to have him generally in the room while he was receiv|ing in&s;truction him&s;elf.</P>
<P>In this manner Jack went on for &s;ome years, leading a life very agreeable to him&s;elf, and di&s;charging his duty very much to the &s;atisfac|tion of his mi&s;tre&s;s. An unlucky accident at length happened to interrupt his tranquility. A young gentleman came down to vi&s;it Ma&s;ter. Willets, who, having been educated in France, and among genteel people in London, had a very great ta&s;te for finery, and a &s;upreme con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t for all the vulgar.

with his hat under his arm, and a little &s;word

by his &s;ide. This young man had a &s;upreme contempt for all the vulgar, which he did not attempt to conceal; and when he had heard the &s;tory of Jack's birth and education, he could &s;carcely bear to be in the &s;ame room with him. Jack &s;oon perceived the aver&s;ion which the &s;tranger entertained for him, and at fir&s;t endea|voured to remove it, by every civility in his power; but when he found that he gained no|thing by all his humility, his temper, natu|rally haughty, took fire, and, as far as he dared, he plainly &s;howed all the re&s;entment he felt.</P>
<P>It happened one day, after Jack had receiv|ed &s;ome very mortifying u&s;age from this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> gentleman, that as he was walking along <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> road, he met with a &s;howman, who was retur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+ing from a neighbouring fair with &s;ome w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="27" REF="028539_0028_0FD939134E5FEA98">
bea&s;ts in a cart. Among the re&s;t was a mid|dle &s;ized monkey, who was not under cover like the re&s;t, and played &s;o many antic tricks, and made &s;o many grimaces, as engaged all Jack's attention, and delighted him very much, for he always had a propen&s;ity for every &s;pecies of drollery. After a variety of que&s;tions and conver&s;ation, the &s;howman, who probably wanted to be rid of his monkey, propo&s;ed to Jack to purcha&s;e him for half a crown. Jack could not re&s;i&s;t the temptation of being ma&s;ter of &s;uch a droll diverting animal, and therefore agreed to the bargain. But when he was left alone with his purcha&s;e, whom he led along by a chain, he &s;oon began to repent his ha&s;te, and knew not how to di&s;po&s;e of him. As there was however, no remedy, Jack brought him carefully home, and confined him &s;afe in an out-hou&s;e, which was not applied to any u&s;e. In this &s;ituation he kept him &s;everal days, with|out accident, and frequently vi&s;ited him at his lei&s;ure hours, with apples, nuts, and &s;uch other pre&s;ents as he could procure. Among the other tricks which the monkey had been taught to perform, he would ri&s;e upon his hind legs at the word of command, and bow with the great|e&s;t politene&s;s to the company. Jack, who had found out the&s;e accompli&s;hments in his friend, could not re&s;i&s;t the impul&s;e of making them &s;ub&s;ervient to his re&s;entment. He, therefore, one day, procured &s;ome flour, with which he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wdered his monkey's head, fixed a large paper <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g to his neck, put an old hat under his arm, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> tied a large iron &s;kewer to his &s;ide, in&s;tead of a &s;word; and thus accoutred led him about

with infinite &s;atisfaction, calling him Mon&s;ieur, and jabbering &s;uch broken French as he had picked up from the conver&s;ation of the vi&s;itor. It happened very unluckily at this very in&s;tant, that the young gentleman him&s;elf pa&s;&s;ed by, and in&s;tantly &s;aw at one glance the intended copy of him&s;elf, and all the malice of little Jack; who was leading him along, and calling

What more he might have done is uncertain, for Jack, who was not of a temper to &s;ee calmly &s;uch an outrage com|mitted upon an animal whom he con&s;ider<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as his friend, flew upon him like a fury, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> wre&s;ting the &s;word out of his hand, broke <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">

arrangement of his dre&s;s. At this in&s;tant, the lady her&s;elf, who had heard the noi&s;e, came down, and the violence of poor Jack was too apparent to be excu&s;ed. Jack, indeed, was &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive to his mi&s;tre&s;s, whom he was very &s;orry to have offended; but, when he was ordered to make conce&s;&s;ions to the young gentleman, as the only conditions upon which he could be kept in the family, he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed. He owned, indeed, that he was much to blame for re&s;enting the provocations he had received, and endeavouring to make his mi&s;tre&s;s's company ridiculous; but as to what he had done in de|fence of his friend the monkey, there were no po&s;&s;ible arguments which could convince him

he was in the lea&s;t to blame; nor would he have made &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to the king him&s;elf.

"A brave fellow, indeed, &s;aid the &s;erjeant; here, my boy, here is your money and your cockade, both which he directly pre&s;ented, for fear his recruit &s;hould change his mind; and thus in a moment little Jack became a &s;oldier.</P>
<P>He had &s;carcely time to feel him&s;elf ea&s;y in his new accoutrements, before he was embark|ed for India in the character of a marine. This kind of life was entirely new to Jack; however, his u&s;ual activity and &s;pirit of ob&s;erva|tion did not de&s;ert him here, and he had not been embarked many weeks, before he was perfectly acquainted with all the duty of a &s;ailor, and in that re&s;pect equal to mo&s;t on board.

All this country con&s;i&s;ts of very lofty hills, co|vered with trees and &s;hrubs of various kinds, which never lo&s;e their leaves, from the perpe|tual warmth of the climate. Through the&s;e it is frequently difficult to force a way, and the hills them&s;elves abound in precipices. It hap|pened that one of the officers whom Jack was attending upon a &s;hooting party, took aim at &s;ome great bird and brought it down; but as it fell into &s;ome deep valley, over &s;ome rocks which it was impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cend, they de&s;pair|ed of gaining their prey. Jack, immediately, with officious ha&s;te, &s;et off and ran down the more level &s;ide of the hill, thinking to make a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">t and reach the valley into which the bird <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> fallen. He &s;et off, therefore, but as he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> totally ignorant of the country, he, in a &s;hort time, buried him&s;elf &s;o deep in the wood, which grew continually thicker, that he knew
<PB N="34" REF="028539_0035_0FD9391FD57C88B8">
not which way to proceed. He then thought it mo&s;t prudent to return; but this he found as difficult to effect as the other. He therefore wandered about the woods with inconceivable difficulty all day, but could never find his com|pany nor even reach the &s;hore, or obtain the pro&s;pect of the &s;ea. At length the night ap|proached, and Jack, who perceived it to be impo&s;&s;ible to do that in the dark, which he had not been able to effect in the light, lay down under a rock, and compo&s;ed him&s;elf to re&s;t, as well as he was able. The next day he ro&s;e with the light, and once more attempted to regain the &s;hore: but unfortunately he had totally lo&s;t all idea of the direction he ought to pur&s;ue, and &s;aw nothing around him but the di&s;mal pro&s;pect of woods and hills and preci|pices, without a guide or path. Jack now began to be very hungry, but as he had a fowling piece with him, and powder and &s;hot, he &s;oon

<PB N="35" REF="028539_0036_0FD9396941218148">
procured him&s;elf a dinner; and kindling a fire with &s;ome dry leaves and &s;ticks, he roa&s;ted his game upon the embers, and dined as com|fortably as he could be expected to do in &s;o forlorn a &s;ituation. Finding him&s;elf much refre&s;hed, he pur&s;ued his journey, but with as little &s;ucce&s;s as ever. On the third day, he indeed came in &s;ight of the &s;ea, but found that he was quite on a different &s;ide of the i&s;land from that where he left the &s;hip, and that neither &s;hip nor boat was to be &s;een. Jack now lo&s;t all hopes of rejoining his comrades, for he knew the &s;hip was to &s;ail at farthe&s;t upon the third day, and would not wait for him. He, therefore, &s;at down very pen&s;ively upon a rock, and ca&s;t his eyes upon the va&s;t extent of ocean which was &s;tretched out before him. He found him&s;elf now abandoned upon a &s;trange country, without a &s;ingle friend, ac|quaintance, or even any one who &s;poke the &s;ame language. He at fir&s;t thought of &s;eeking out the natives, and making known to them his deplorable &s;tate; but he began to fear the reception he might meet with among them. They might not be plea&s;ed, he thought&punc; with his company, and might take the liberty of treating him as the white men generally treat the blacks when they get them into their po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion; that is, make him work hard with very little victuals, and knock him on the head if he attempted to run away. And therefore, &s;ays Jack, as he was meditating all alone, it may, perhaps, be better for me to &s;tay quiet where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> am. It is true, indeed, I &s;hall not have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> company to talk to, but then I &s;hall

He had not examined far before he found a dry cavern in a rock, which he thought would prove a very comfortable re&s;idence; he therefore went to work with an hatchet he had with him, and cut &s;ome boughs of trees, which he &s;pread upon the floor, and over tho&s;e a long &s;ilky kind of gra&s;s, which he found in plenty near the place, to make him|&s;elf a bed. His next care was, how to &s;ecure him&s;elf in ca&s;e of any attack, for he did not know whether the i&s;land contained any wild bea&s;ts or not. He therefore cut down &s;everal branches of trees, and wove them into a kind of wicker work, as he had &s;een the men do hurdles when he lived with the farmer; with this contrivance he found he could very &s;ecurely barricade the entrance of his cave. And now&punc; as the evening was again approaching, he began to feel him&s;elf hungry, and &s;eeking along t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;ea-&s;hore, he found &s;ome &s;hell-fi&s;h, which &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+plied him with a plentiful meal.

<PB N="37" REF="028539_0038_0FD9396B299ACD78">
with a re&s;olution to &s;truggle manfully with the difficulties of his &s;ituation. He walked into the woods and &s;aw &s;everal kinds of fruit and berries, &s;ome of which he ventured to eat, as the birds had pecked them, and found the ta&s;te agreeable. He al&s;o dug up &s;everal &s;pecies of roots, but feared to ta&s;te them le&s;t they &s;hould be poi&s;onous. At length, he &s;elected one that very much re&s;embled a potatoe, and determin|ed to roa&s;t it in the embers, and ta&s;te a very &s;mall bit. It can hardly, thought Jack, do me much hurt, in &s;o very &s;mall a quantity; and if that agrees with me I will increa&s;e the do&s;e. The root was fortunately extremely whole&s;ome and nutritive, &s;o that Jack was in a very &s;hort time tolerably &s;ecure again&s;t the danger of wanting food. In this manner did Jack lead a kind of &s;avage, but tolerably con|tented life, for &s;everal months; during which time he enjoyed perfect health, and was never di&s;covered by any of the natives. He u&s;ed &s;everal times a-day to vi&s;it the &s;hore, in hopes that &s;ome &s;hip might pa&s;s that way and deliver him from his &s;olitary impri&s;onment. This, at length, happened, by the boat of an Engli&s;h &s;hip, that was &s;ailing to India, happening to touch upon the coa&s;t; Jack in&s;tantly hailed the crew, and the officer, upon hearing the &s;tory, agreed to receive him; the captain too, when he found that Jack was by no means a con|temptible &s;ailor, very willingly gave him his pa&s;&s;age, and promi&s;ed him a gratuity be&s;ides, if he behaved well.</P>
<P>Jack arrived in India without any accident, and relating his &s;tory, was permitted to &s;erve

in another regiment as his own was no longer there. He &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his courage and good behaviour on &s;everal occa|&s;ions, and before long was advanced to the rank of a &s;erjeant. In this capacity, he was order|ed out upon an expedition into the remote parts of the country. The little army in which he &s;erved now marched on for &s;everal weeks, through a burning climate, and in want of all the nece&s;&s;aries of life. At length, they entered upon &s;ome exten&s;ive plains, which bordered upon the celebrated country of the Tartars. Jack was perfectly well acquainted with the hi&s;tory of this people, and their method of fighting. He knew them to be &s;ome of the be&s;t hor&s;emen in the world; indefatigable in their attacks, though often repul&s;ed returning to the charge, and not to be invaded with im|punity; he, therefore, took the liberty of ob|&s;erving

to &s;ome of the officers, that nothing could be more dangerous than their ra&s;hly en|gaging them&s;elves in tho&s;e exten&s;ive plains, where they were every moment expo&s;ed to the attacks of cavalry, without any &s;ucce&s;sful me|thod

of defence, or place of retreat, in ca&s;e of any misfortune. The&s;e remon&s;trances were not much attended to, and after a few hours farther march, they were alarmed by the ap|proach of a con&s;iderable body of Tartar hor&s;e|men. They, however, drew up with all the order they were able, and firing &s;everal &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive vollies, endeavoured to keep the enemy at a di&s;tance. But the Tartars had no de&s;ign of doing that with a con&s;iderable lo&s;s, which they were &s;ure of doing with ea&s;e and &s;afety. In&s;tead therefore of charging the Europeans, they con|tented them&s;elves with giving continual alarms, and menacing them on every &s;ide, without
<PB N="40" REF="028539_0041_0FD9392B77D526E0">
expo&s;ing them&s;elves to any con&s;iderable dan|ger. The army now attempted to retreat, ho|ping that they &s;hould be able to arrive at the neighbouring mountains, where they would be &s;afe from the incur&s;ions of the hor&s;e. But in this attempt they were equally di&s;appointed; for another con&s;iderable body of enemies ap|peared on that &s;ide, and blocked their pa&s;&s;age. The Europeans now found they were &s;urround|ed on all &s;ides, and that re&s;i&s;tance was vain. The commanding officer, therefore, judged it expedient to try what could be effected by ne|gociation, and &s;ent one of his officers, who under&s;tood &s;omething of the Tartar language, to treat with the general of the enemies. The Tartar chief received the Europeans with great civility, and after having gently reproached them with their ambition, in coming &s;o far to invade a people who had never injured them, he con&s;ented upon very moderate conditions to their enlargement: but he in&s;i&s;ted upon having their arms delivered up, except a very few which he permitted them to keep for defence in their return, and upon retaining a certain number of Europeans as ho&s;tages for the performance of the &s;tipulated articles. Among tho&s;e who were thus left with the Tartars, Jack happened to be included, and while all the re&s;t &s;eemed incon|&s;olable at being thus made pri&s;oners by a bar|barous nation, he alone, accu&s;tomed to all the vici&s;&s;itudes of life, retained his cheerfulne&s;s, and prepared to meet every rever&s;e of fortune with his u&s;ual firmne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Tartars, among whom Jack was now to re&s;ide, con&s;titute &s;everal different tribes or
<PB N="41" REF="028539_0042_0FD9397325F112E0">
nations which inhabit an immen&s;e extent of country both in Europe and A&s;ia. Their coun|try is in general open and uncultivated, with out cities or towns, &s;uch as we &s;ee in England. The inhabitants them&s;elves are a bold and hardy race of men that live in &s;mall tents, and change their place of abode with the different &s;ea&s;ons of the year. All their property con&s;i&s;ts in herds of cattle, which they drive along with them from place to place; and upon who&s;e milk and fle&s;h they &s;ub&s;i&s;t. They are particularly fond of hor&s;es, of which they have a &s;mall but ex|cellent breed, hardy and indefatigable for the purpo&s;es of war, and they excel in the manage|ment of them, beyond what is ea&s;y to con|ceive. Immen&s;e herds of the&s;e animals wan|der loo&s;e about the de&s;erts, but marked with the particular mark of the per&s;on or tribe to which they belong. When they want any of the&s;e animals for u&s;e, a certain number of their young men jump upon their hor&s;es with nothing but an halter to guide them, each carrying in his hand a pole with a noo&s;e or cord at the end. When they come in &s;ight of the herd, they pur&s;ue the hor&s;e they wi&s;h to take at full &s;peed, come up with him in &s;pite of his &s;wift|ne&s;s, and never fail to throw the noo&s;e about his neck as he runs. They are frequently known to jump upon young hor&s;es that have pa&s;&s;ed their whole life in the de&s;ert, and with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nly a girt around the animal's body to hold <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, maintain their &s;eat, in &s;pite of all his vio|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent exertions, until they have wearied him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut and reduced him into perfect obedience. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uch was the nation with whom the lot of Jack

was now to re&s;ide, nor was he long before he had an opportunity of &s;howing his talents.</P>
<P>It happened that a favourite hor&s;e of the chief was taken with a violent fever, and &s;eem|ed to be in immediate danger of death. The khan, for &s;o he is called among the Tartars, &s;eeing his hor&s;e grow hourly wor&s;e, at length applied to the Europeans, to know if they could &s;ugge&s;t any thing for his recovery. All the officers were profoundly ignorant of far|riery; but when the application was made to Jack, he de&s;ired to &s;ee the hor&s;e, and with great gravity began to feel his pul&s;e, by pa&s;&s;ing his hand within the animal's fore-leg; which gave the Tartars a very high idea of his ingenuity. Finding that the animal was in a high fever, he propo&s;ed to the khan to let him blood, which he had learned to do very dexterou&s;ly in England. He obtained permi&s;&s;ion to do as he plea&s;ed, and having by great good luck a lancet

<PB N="43" REF="028539_0044_0FD93977B6117228">
with him, he let him blood very dexterou&s;ly in the neck. After this operation he covered him up, and gave him a warm potion made out of &s;uch ingredients as he could procure upon the &s;pot, and left him quiet. In a few hours the hor&s;e began to mend, and, to the great joy of the khan, perfectly recovered in a few days. This cure, &s;o opportunely perfor|med, rai&s;ed the reputation of Jack &s;o high, that every body came to con&s;ult him about their hor&s;es, and in a &s;hort time he was the univer&s;al farrier of the tribe. The khan him|&s;elf conceived &s;o great an affection for him, that he gave him an excellent hor&s;e to ride upon and attend him in his hunting parties; and Jack, who excelled in the art of hor&s;eman&s;hip, managed him &s;o well as to gain the e&s;teem of the whole nation.</P>
<P><FIGURE>

<P><PB N="44" REF="028539_0045_0FD9393340EE1538">The Tartars, though they are excellent hor&s;emen, have no idea of managing their hor&s;es, unle&s;s by violence; but Jack in a &s;hort time, by continual care and attention, made his hor&s;e &s;o docile and obedient to every mo|tion of his hand and leg, that the Tartars them&s;elves would gaze upon him with admi|ration, and allow them&s;elves to be out-done. Not contented with this, he procured &s;ome iron, and made his hor&s;e-&s;hoes in the Euro|pean ta&s;te; this al&s;o was matter of a&s;toni&s;hment to all the Tartars, who are accu&s;tomed to ride their hor&s;es un&s;hod. He next ob&s;erved that the Tartar &s;addles are all prodigiou&s;ly large and cumber&s;ome, rai&s;ing the hor&s;emen up to a great di&s;tance from the back of his hor&s;e. Jack &s;et him&s;elf to work, and was not long before he had completed &s;omething like an Engli&s;h hunt|ing &s;addle, on which he paraded before the khan. All mankind &s;eem to have a pa&s;&s;ion for novelty, and the khan was &s;o delighted with this effort of Jack's ingenuity, that, after paying him the highe&s;t compliments, he intimated a de&s;ire of having &s;uch a &s;addle for him&s;elf. Jack was the mo&s;t obliging creature in the world, and &s;pared no labour to &s;erve his friends; he went to work again, and in a &s;hort time com|pleted a &s;addle &s;till more elegant for the khan. The&s;e exertions gained him the favour and e&s;teem both of the khan and all the tribe; &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that Jack was an univer&s;al favourite and loaded with pre&s;ents, while all the re&s;t of the officers, who had never learned to make a &s;addle or an hor&s;e-&s;hoe, were treated with contempt and indifference.

greate&s;t genero&s;ity to his countrymen, and divid|ed with them all the mutton and veni&s;on which were given him; but he could not help &s;ome|times ob&s;erving, that it was great pity they had not learned to make an hor&s;e-&s;hoe in&s;tead of dancing and dre&s;&s;ing hair.</P>
<P>And now an amba&s;&s;ador arrived from the Engli&s;h &s;ettlements, with an account that all the conditions of the treaty had been perform|ed, and demanding the re&s;titution of the pri|&s;oners. The Tartar chief was too much a man of honour to delay an in&s;tant, and they were all re&s;tored; but before they &s;et out, Jack laboured with indefatigable zeal to fini&s;h a cou|ple of &s;addles and a dozen hor&s;e-&s;hoes, which he pre&s;ented to the khan, with many expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude. The khan was charmed with this proof of his affection, and in return made him a pre&s;ent of a couple of fine hor&s;es, and &s;eve|ral valuable &s;kins of bea&s;ts. Jack arrived without any accident at the Engli&s;h &s;ettlements, and &s;elling his &s;kins and hor&s;es, found him&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a moderate &s;um of money. He now began to have a de&s;ire to return to Eng|land, and one of the officers, who had often been obliged to him during his captivity, pro|cured him a di&s;charge. He embarked, there|fore, with all his property, on board a &s;hip, which was returning home, and in a few months was &s;afely landed at Plymouth.</P>
<P>But Jack was too active and too prudent to give him&s;elf up to idlene&s;s. After con&s;idering various &s;chemes of bu&s;ine&s;s, he determined to take up his old trade of forging; and for that purpo&s;e made a journey into the North, and

His ma&s;ter, who had always entertained an e&s;teem for Jack, welcomed him with great affection, and being in want of a foreman, he engaged him at a very hand&s;ome price, for that place.

<P>THERE reigned once upon a time, in a di&s;tant i&s;land, a good prince who was pa&s;|&s;ionately beloved by all his &s;ubjects. It could not happen otherwi&s;e, for he was their common father. He provided for all their rea&s;onable wants, he rewarded tho&s;e who de&s;erved well of their country, and he let none of the wicked, nor even of the idle, e&s;cape without puni&s;h|ment. This amiable monarch had but one cau&s;e of anxiety; Myra, his only child, by no means requited the attention which had been given to her education. At twelve years of age &s;he was &s;hamefully ignorant. Her thought|le&s;&s;ne&s;s made her forget every le&s;&s;on which &s;he had been taught, and her pre&s;umption kept pace with her want of knowledge; of con&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+quence as &s;he thought her&s;elf perfectly acco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+pli&s;hed, &s;he de&s;pi&s;ed all in&s;truction.

&s;he was indulging her ab&s;urd vanity by hinting, that were &s;he to govern the i&s;land, things would be better managed than they were now. The King, having been informed of his daughter's &s;entiments, &s;ent for her immediately. On her coming, he told her, without the lea&s;t di&s;com|po&s;ure,
<Q>That as &s;he was de&s;tined to reign, one day or other, over his kingdoms, he &s;hould wi&s;h to know how far her talents were proper for &s;o important a charge.</Q>
<Q>We may, if you plea&s;e,</Q>
added this good prince,
<Q>make the experiment without any delay. Carele&s;s as you always were about the le&s;|&s;ons which have been given you in geogra|phy, you cannot but know that <HI>The Fortu|nate I&s;land</HI> makes a part of my dominions; it is a &s;mall, but well inhabited di&s;trict; its people are active, indu&s;trious, good tempered, and thoroughly attached to their &s;overeigns. Go, child! reign over them, I &s;hall order a yacht to be in&s;tantly fitted up to convey you to your capital.</Q>
Then making a mo&s;t pro|found reverence to the little &s;overeign,
<Q>Adieu, madam,</Q>
&s;aid he, with difficulty concealing a &s;mile.</P>
<P>Myra, for &s;ome time, thought that the king meant only to divert him&s;elf, but &s;oon found her mi&s;take, and that every thing was preparing for her voyage. She was even permitted to form a court to her mind, and accordingly &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">icked out a dozen of her playfellows to ac|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ompany her. "The&s;e young people," &s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e to her father, "are &s;o very rational and &s;e|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> date, that there can be no need of their being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> attended by governe&s;&s;es or tutors." The
<PB N="50" REF="028539_0051_0FD9393A57C0EEC0">
king, however, thought otherwi&s;e, and ordered the teachers to embark with their pupils. The young &s;overeign, on her part, took care there &s;hould be abundance of mu&s;icians for her balls, and that a company of players &s;hould be pro|vided for the amu&s;ement of her&s;elf and her court. On the morn of her departure, &s;he took an affectionate leave of her father, but the few tears which &s;he &s;hed, were &s;oon dried up by the con&s;ideration of her being going to a place where &s;he &s;hould do "ju&s;t what &s;he plea&s;ed." "The only advice that I &s;hall give you," &s;aid the king at parting,
<Q>is, that you would fol|low the advice of Ari&s;tus (the governor of the i&s;land over which you are to reign) in every thing of importance. He is a man for whom I have a high e&s;teem, and with rea&s;on, as he is di&s;creet, hone&s;t, and humane. I could wi&s;h that you would make him your fir&s;t mini&s;ter; I mean, that you &s;hould con&s;ult him in every thing, and entru&s;t him with the execution of all your orders.</Q></P>
<P>This direction no way &s;uited the ta&s;te of our young Queen, who wi&s;hed to have given that important charge to one of her favourites, Philintus, a tall, genteel lad, not indeed many years older than her&s;elf, but one who, to to|lerable &s;kill in dancing and &s;inging, added the very agreeable talent of elegant flattery. He was him&s;elf as aver&s;e to &s;tudy, and of con&s;e|quence as ignorant as his royal mi&s;tre&s;s; but he had knowledge enough of his own intere&s;t to excite him never to omit a&s;&s;uring her that every one looked on her as a model of a per|fect prince&s;s, although he was con&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ious that,
<PB N="51" REF="028539_0052_0FD93986F5DECD50">
out of her hearing, &s;he was univer&s;ally blamed for being &s;o totally unlike her excellent father, and for &s;pending her whole time in trifling amu&s;ements.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the little &s;overeign reached her i&s;land, &s;he beheld with plea&s;ure troops of &s;hep|herds and &s;hepherde&s;&s;es, in elegant fancy dre&s;|&s;es of ro&s;e colour and white, who &s;ung carols in prai&s;e of their new Queen, &s;trewed &s;weet &s;cented flowers in her path, and pre&s;ented her with odoriferous no&s;egays. Myra, charmed with this &s;pecimen of her &s;ubjects gallantry, ordered money to be di&s;tributed among&s;t them; and, under the conduct of Ari&s;tus, repaired to a lovely, though &s;mall palace, fitted up for her reception. Fatigued with the voyage, the Queen and her young court ha&s;tened to their repo&s;e; but her Maje&s;ty forgot not to order, for the next day, a comedy to be acted, followed by a ball and a &s;plendid entertainment. On the next morn, Myra and her court amu&s;ed them&s;elves by walking into the capital town, which lay not far from the palace. "Ob&s;erve," &s;aid Ari&s;tus to his &s;overeign,
<Q>the air of con|tent which reigns in every face we meet.</Q>
"That," &s;aid Philintus,
<Q>we &s;hould attri|bute to the pre&s;ence of our lovely Queen.</Q>
"Without doubt," replied Ari&s;tus,
<Q>they are &s;en&s;ible of that honour; but I ought to in|form you, that their gaiety is chiefly owing to their being con&s;cious of the excellent go|vernment under which they live, and of the wi&s;dom of tho&s;e laws by which their King, whom they look upon as their father, go|verns the country.</Q>
"Let us now," &s;aid
<PB N="52" REF="028539_0053_0FD9393BEFCE2CA8">
Myra, "extend our walks into the country." They did &s;o. An orchard, in full bloom, now tempted her to take a nearer view of its beauty, "What," &s;aid &s;he to Ari&s;tus,
<Q>occa&s;ions the buzzing &s;ounds which I hear?</Q>
"The bees," replied he;
<Q>a u&s;eful tribe of your Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects.</Q>
At that in&s;tant, mo&s;t unfortu|nately, one of the&s;e animals, not perfectly ac|quainted with the re&s;pect due to royalty, and di&s;gu&s;ted at the Queen's approaching too near to his hive, &s;ettled on her hand, and made her feel his &s;ting!&mdash;
<Q>Shocking creatures, the&s;e bees!</Q>
exclaimed Myra;
<Q>one of them has half killed me!</Q>
<Q>The pre&s;umptuous, un|grateful wretches ought,</Q>
&s;aid Philintus, "to be utterly extirpated." "You are right," &s;aid the Queen;
<Q>I will have them de&s;troyed, not on my own account, but to pre&s;erve my poor people from receiving &s;uch cruel wounds, when they are pur&s;uing their occupations in the country.</Q>
"Permit me," &s;aid Ari&s;tus,
<Q>to ob&s;erve, that the&s;e accidents happen but very &s;eldom, and that the pain which the bees occa&s;ion by their &s;tings, is trifling, when compared with the va&s;t advantage which ac|crues from their labours; your &s;ubjects, madam, will &s;uffer &s;everely indeed, if they are deprived of that u&s;eful creature.</Q>
&mdash;Here he was interrupted by Philintus, who bur&s;ting with laughter, cried out,
<Q>A pretty tale you tell us, Ari&s;tus! why &s;ure you take us al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for children! Suffer indeed! what! becau&s;e that na&s;ty in&s;ect is kept from &s;tinging them&punc; Make us believe <HI>that,</HI> if you can.</Q>
<Q>I wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> have every bee in my kingdom put to death,</Q>
<PB N="53" REF="028539_0054_0FD93987FA352750">
&s;aid the young Queen with an air of dignity. "Po&s;&s;ibly," &s;aid Ari&s;tus,
<Q>your Maje&s;ty may &s;ee cau&s;e hereafter to repent of this ha&s;ty command.</Q>
"Neverthele&s;s," repeated Myra, "it <HI>&s;hall</HI> be executed." Ari&s;tus retired with a &s;igh, and Philintus loudly applauded the ming|led humanity and firmne&s;s of his infant &s;ove|reign. That evening the Queen entertained her&s;elf at the play, and afterwards was pre&s;ent at a ball, which, with a magnificent &s;upper, la&s;ted until two o'clock in the morning.</P>
<P>Unluckily among the ladies of the bed cham|ber were two, who, not having reached their eleventh year, had been u&s;ed to eat little or no &s;uppers, to take moderate exerci&s;e, and to go to bed early. But the royal banquet had been &s;o tempting, the ball &s;o charming, and the whole &s;o perfectly new to them, that they had de&s;pi&s;ed the admonitions of their governe&s;&s;es, who had very naturally remon&s;trated again&s;t their launching at once into this new &s;y&s;tem. In con&s;equence, they were both extremely ill the next morning. The phy&s;ician attended, and ordered proper medicines, which they re|fu&s;ed to take.
<Q>They were permitted by the Queen,</Q>
they &s;aid,
<Q>to do what they liked be&s;t, and they hated na&s;ty phy&s;ic.</Q>
Their complaints, however, increa&s;ed; they could neither eat, drink, or &s;leep, and one of the two felt the attack of a fever. On this the go|verne&s;&s;es were obliged to have recour&s;e to the royal authority, and the Queen having com|manded the young ladies to &s;ubmit to di&s;ci|pline, they took what was ordered and all went right again.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="028539_0055_0FD9393DC34C73B0">One day that the young Queen was walking in the garden of her palace, &s;he was di&s;gu&s;ted at the deva&s;tation which had been made by ca|terpillars on the leaves of the trees.
<Q>What vile creatures are the&s;e!</Q>
&s;aid &s;he to Philin|tus:
<Q>Did you ever &s;ee &s;uch a piece of work as they have made here?</Q>
"I think," re|plied the courtier,
<Q>that it would be a good deed to root them out of the i&s;land, and to proclaim rewards for tho&s;e who would un|dertake to de&s;troy them.</Q>
<Q>What &s;ay you to that, Ari&s;tus,</Q>
&s;aid Myra,
<Q>can my &s;ub|jects exi&s;t without caterpillars?</Q>
<Q>Your Maje&s;ty,</Q>
replied Ari&s;tus,
<Q>has not forgot the bees, I find, but here the ca&s;e is widely different. The caterpillars which have &s;tript tho&s;e trees do much mi&s;chief, and are of no one u&s;e to &s;ociety.</Q>
"I am heartily glad," &s;aid the Queen,
<Q>that we coincide in opinion, for I am determined to have all the cater|pillars in my dominions de&s;troyed; I hate them, na&s;ty creatures!</Q>
"Your Maje&s;ty" &s;aid Ari&s;tus,
<Q>certainly means to except from this general ma&s;&s;acre, that kind of caterpil|lar which produces the &s;ilk-worm.</Q>
<Q>Do but hear him,</Q>
&s;aid Philintus, in the Queen's ear;
<Q>that fellow makes a point of contradict|ing your Maje&s;ty in every thing.</Q>
<Q>Let every caterpillar in my realm be put to death,</Q>
ex|claimed the piqued &s;overeign.</P>
<P>"I am tired to death," &s;aid Myra, one day,
<Q>of this eternal verdure. The&s;e walks of turf, and the&s;e clumps of laurel, though I like them well enough on the whole, yet being repeated &s;o often, they fatigue my eyes;&mdash;
<PB N="55" REF="028539_0056_0FD9398DB6815E80">
green, and green, and nothing but green&mdash; Why can I not have a ro&s;e-colour bower?</Q>
Philintus now turned all his thoughts towards the accompli&s;hment of his &s;overeign's rational wi&s;h. He had ob&s;erved in a di&s;tant part of the garden an arbour where a honey &s;uckle over&s;pread the green frame work. He ordered the leaves to be &s;tripped off, the wood to be painted ro&s;e colour, and he covered the whole with artificial ro&s;es hanging by crim&s;on rib|bands. The Queen was enchanted with this gaudy retreat, and as &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw it, ordered her dinner to be &s;et out upon that very &s;pot. The &s;un &s;hone out with great power, and &s;carce had the company &s;ate ten minutes at their meal, before &s;ome complained of aching heads, &s;ome of dazzled eyes; all lo&s;t their appetites, and the whole was a confu&s;ion of heat and glare. Ari&s;tus advi&s;ed the whole party to abandon the flaring &s;cene, and to refre&s;h their eyes by gazing on the turf in &s;ome &s;hady place. They did &s;o, and all went well again. In con&s;e|quence, it was &s;ettled by her Maje&s;ty in coun|cil, that, during the &s;ummer, it were better for the leaves of the trees to be green, than to be ro&s;e colour.</P>
<P>Myra was &s;o enchanted with the plea&s;ures of her palace, that &s;he gave her&s;elf little trouble as to what pa&s;&s;ed in the i&s;land at large. Her whole time was employed in &s;chemes for in|crea&s;ing and varying her amu&s;ements: &s;ome|times, indeed, &s;he walked into the country: but her pre&s;ence no longer appeared to give any plea&s;ure to her &s;ubjects&mdash;there were no more &s;ongs in her prai&s;e&mdash;no more cries of
<PB N="56" REF="028539_0057_0FD939424F8196D8">
"Long live our Queen!" "What," &s;aid Myra,
<Q>can occa&s;ion this &s;trange alteration in the behaviour of my people? Are they di&s;|plea&s;ed with any part of my government?</Q>
"If," &s;aid Philintus,
<Q>they are out of humour with &s;uch an amiable &s;overeign, they do not de&s;erve the honour of her inquiries.</Q>
This an&s;wer was not entirely &s;atisfactory to the Queen; &s;he was even for &s;ome time, buried in thought; but the efforts of Philintus, (who had ob&s;erved the gloom on her countenance,) and the gay turn of his conver&s;ation, together with the novelty of an entertainment which he propo&s;ed for the next evening, drove away all &s;erious thoughts, and &s;prightline&s;s re&s;umed its reign again. The plan was, that all the court &s;hould appear in pa&s;toral dre&s;&s;es, and that the company &s;hould dance on one of tho&s;e elegant lawns with which the palace garden abounded. Myra approved of this plan, only de&s;iring that the habits might be as elegant as the plan would allow.
<Q>They can only be made of linen, madam,</Q>
&s;aid one of the bedchamber-women. "How &s;o,?" &s;aid the Queen.</P>
<P><Q>There is not, in your Maje&s;ty's dominions, &s;ilk enough for one dre&s;s.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You mu&s;t be mi&s;taken. On my taking the government into my hands, I ob&s;erved &s;hops without end, well furni&s;hed with &s;ilk.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It is true, Madam, there were &s;uch; but they are now all &s;hut up, and the owner<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> have left the i&s;land.</Q></P>
<P>"And why &s;o, pray?"</P>
<P><Q>Since your Maje&s;ty's orders for the de&s;truc|tion
<PB N="57" REF="028539_0058_0FD9398EB9E19C98">
of all caterpillars, the &s;ilk manufacture is entirely &s;topped.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Aye! why, what have tho&s;e na&s;ty vermin to do with the manufacture of &s;ilk?</Q></P>
<P><Q>There is one &s;pecies of tho&s;e caterpillars which produces the materials, without which &s;ilk cannot be made; and as the &s;ellers of &s;ilk in the towns are in general connected, by marriage or relation&s;hip, with the breed|ers of the &s;ilk-worms, they have determined all together to quit a country where they are deprived of the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting.</Q></P>
<P>That very evening the Queen ob&s;erved with a &s;urpri&s;e, which almo&s;t equalled horror, that the apartments of the palace were lighted with tallow candles. "Heavens!" exclaimed the affronted Sovereign,
<Q>what means this filthy &s;ight?</Q>
She was told that there were no wax|en tapers to be found in the i&s;le. "'Tis im|po&s;&s;ible!" &s;he cried; "let Ari&s;tus be &s;ent for." He appeared.
<Q>Have you not told me, Sir, that my i&s;land abounded with wax?</Q>
<Q>Madam, it did &s;o, when I gave you that in|formation.</Q>
<Q>And how happens it that it is not &s;o now?</Q>
<Q>Becau&s;e &s;ince your Ma|je&s;ty ordered the bees to be extirpated, no more wax is to be found.</Q>
Philintus &s;neer|ed at this reply, and Myra a&s;ked with a&s;toni&s;h|ment,
<Q>What was the connexion between bees and tapers?</Q>
"Without them," &s;aid Ari&s;tus,
<Q>the tapers can not exi&s;t, &s;ince the bees &s;upply the materials of which the tapers are compo&s;ed.</Q>
<Q>And what is become of tho&s;e who u&s;ed to get their living by making tho&s;e tapers?</Q>
"Poor &s;ouls!" replied Ari&s;|tus,
<Q><PB N="58" REF="028539_0059_0FD939456BE939E8">they are on the point of quitting a place, where they cannot earn their bread. Alas!</Q>
added he,
<Q>were your Maje&s;ty to make, at this time, the tour of your dominions, you would find the face of the whole country de|plorably altered.</Q>
Philintus would have turned this account into ridicule, but Myra, by a look, &s;topped his buffoonery, and retired to her chamber with a heavy heart.</P>
<P>The next morning &s;he took Ari&s;tus with her, and drove into the environs of her capital. "You were too much in the right," &s;he &s;aid,
<Q>when you bade me expect a deplorable alter|ation among my people. I hear no more acclamations! no more &s;ongs! but I &s;ee the painfulle&s;t of &s;ights; crowds of people in rags, begging their bread,</Q>
"Formerly," &s;aid Ari&s;tus,
<Q>no beggars were to be found here; there was a large building erected for the poor, where the old were maintained, the &s;ick cured, and all the young folks &s;et to work; but &s;ince your Maje&s;ty has allow|ed twelve to be the age of di&s;cretion, many of the&s;e children have refu&s;ed to be employ|ed, and choo&s;ing to wander about the country, without knowing how to g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eir bread, they are of cour&s;e reduced to rags and mi&s;ery.</Q></P>
<P>The Queen, having given &s;ome relief to the&s;e wretched objects, proceeded to a&s;k Ari&s;|tus, what was become of the crowds of bu&s;y people who were u&s;ed to throng in the &s;treets of the capital? "for," &s;aid &s;he,
<Q>half the hou&s;es &s;eem to be &s;hut up, and the whole town ap|pears de&s;erted, in compari&s;on of its &s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> when I fir&s;t &s;aw it.</Q>
The mini&s;ter told her&punc;
<Q><PB N="59" REF="028539_0060_0FD939949B85FD70">that there was a mutual dependence of one trade upon another, and that, in con&s;equence of the departure of the &s;ilk and wax mer|chants and manufacturers, tho&s;e who were u&s;ed to &s;upply that large body of men with cloaths, &s;hoes and &s;tockings, provi&s;ions, and every other accommodation, having now no market for their goods, had &s;hut up their &s;hops, and were preparing, one and all, for their departure.</Q>
He added,
<Q>that it was much to be feared, that the farmers, who u&s;ed to bring to the town corn, hay, butter, eggs, poultry, &amp;c. together with their fami|lies, labourers, &amp;c. would &s;oon follow this example.</Q></P>
<P>Struck with this painful detail, the young Queen, who&s;e goodne&s;s of heart was equal to the thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s of her head, exclaimed in an agony of di&s;tre&s;s,
<Q>Oh heavens! why did I leave my father's court? why take upon me a ta&s;k of which I was &s;o incapable? I &s;uffer &s;everely for my pre&s;umption, but at lea&s;t I will do no more mi&s;chief here.</Q>
Then turning to Ari&s;tus, &s;he begged him to ha&s;ten the preparations for her return to the kingdom of her father. Her orders were in|&s;tantly obeyed, and &s;he with her whole court, took leave of the Fortunate I&s;land, and &s;oon reached the port they wi&s;hed for. As &s;oon as Myra &s;aw the King, &s;he threw her&s;elf at his feet, bathed in tears. "How is this," &s;aid he,
<Q>my daughter, are you returned already? are you &s;o &s;oon weary of &s;overeign power?</Q>
"Alas! Sire!" replied the weeping Myra,
<Q>never was any being more wretched than your
<PB N="60" REF="028539_0061_0FD9394A71B40B78">
daughter! I have childi&s;hly thrown away my own happine&s;s, and that of tho&s;e whom you entru&s;ted to my care. The i&s;land which I have governed, no longer de&s;erves the name of Fortunate. I have, by my own mi&s;ma|nagement, reduced an indu&s;trious people to beggary and ruin! but I conjure you, Sire, to order all my jewels to be in&s;tantly &s;old, that I may, by their means, in &s;ome &s;ort re|lieve the mi&s;eries which my infantine folly has brought upon them.</Q>
<Q>Make your&s;elf ea&s;y,</Q>
&s;aid the good King, &s;oothing his af|flicted daughter,
<Q>the mi&s;chiefs which your want of con&s;ideration has cau&s;ed, are by no means irreparable. I fore&s;aw that you would make great mi&s;takes in government, and ma|naged affairs &s;o as to prevent tho&s;e mi&s;takes from having any very bad con&s;equences. Tho&s;e of your &s;ubjects, who have by your errors been forced to quit your i&s;le, have, by the direction of Ari&s;tus, found a comfortable retreat in this kingdom, have been &s;upplied with all nece&s;&s;aries, and will now return to their own country, with proper materials, to re-a&s;&s;ume their &s;everal trades and occupa|tions. You have, my beloved Myra, an ex|cellent heart, and in all the mi&s;chief which you have done, you have had the be&s;t inten|tion in the world. This ought to teach you, that princes ought not to tru&s;t to their good di&s;po&s;itions alone, but that they &s;hould take coun&s;el with the mo&s;t intelligent of their &s;ub|jects, concerning the mea&s;ures of their go|vernment, and above all, that they &s;hould guard again&s;t forming too high an opinion of
<PB N="61" REF="028539_0062_0FD939957957B3E8">
their own wi&s;dom. The errors of private per&s;ons can only affect a &s;mall number of individuals, but tho&s;e of &s;overeigns may ruin nations.</Q></P>
<P>Myra profited by this le&s;&s;on, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d by her own experience. She dedicated, for the future, a con&s;iderable part of her time to &s;tudy, and for|bade Philantus ever to appear in her pre&s;ence again.</P>

<P>There are three different kinds of bees in every hive. Fir&s;t, the labouring bees, which make up the far greate&s;t number, and are thought to be neither male or female, but mere|ly born for the purpo&s;es of labour, and continu|ing the breed, by &s;upplying the young with provi&s;ion, while yet in their helple&s;s &s;tate. The &s;econd &s;ort are the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ones; they are of a darker colour, longer, and more thick by one third than the former: they are &s;uppo&s;ed to be the males; and there is not above a hundred of them, in a hive of &s;even or eight thou&s;and bees. The third &s;ort is much larger than either of the former, and &s;till fewer in number: &s;ome a&s;&s;ert, that there is not above one in every &s;warm; but this later ob&s;ervers affirm not to be true, there being &s;ometimes five or &s;ix in the &s;ame hive. The&s;e are called queen-bees, and are &s;aid to lay all the eggs from which the whole &s;warm is hatched in a &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>In examining the &s;tructure of the common working bee, the fir&s;t remarkable part that of|fers
<PB N="63" REF="028539_0064_0FD9399770620C20">
is the trunk, which &s;erves to extract the honey from flowers. It is not formed, like that of the other flies, in the manner of a tube, by which the fluid is to be &s;ucked up; but like a a be&s;om, to &s;weep, or a tongue, to lick it a|way. The animal is furni&s;hed al&s;o with teeth. which &s;erve it in making wax. This &s;ub&s;tance is gathered from flowers, like honey; it con|&s;i&s;ts of that du&s;t or farina which contributes to the fecundation of plants, and is moulded into wax by the little animal, at le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ure. Every bee, when it leaves the hive to collect this precious &s;tore, enters into the cup of the flower, parti|cularly &s;uch as &s;eem charged with the greate&s;t quantities of this yellow farina. As the ani|mal's body is covered over with hair, it rolls it&s;elf within the flower, and &s;oon becomes quite covered with the du&s;t, which it &s;oon after bru&s;hes off with its own hind legs, and kneads into two little balls. In the thighs of the hind legs there are to cavities, edged with hair; and into the&s;e, as into a ba&s;ket, the animal &s;ticks its pellets. Thus employed, the bee flies from flower to flower, encrea&s;ing its &s;tore, and adding to its &s;tock of wax; until the ball, upon each thigh, becomes as big as a grain of pepper: by this time, having got a &s;ufficient load, it returns, the be&s;t of its way to the hive.</P>
<P>The belly of the bee is divided into &s;ix rings, which &s;ometimes &s;horten the body, by &s;lipping one over the other. It contains within it, be|&s;ide the inte&s;tines, the honey-bag, the venom-bag, and the &s;ting. The honey-bag is as tran&s;|parent as cry&s;tal, containing the honey that
<PB N="64" REF="028539_0065_0FD9394D0D79B500">
the bee has bru&s;hed from the flowers; of which the greater part is carried to the hive, and poured into the cells of the honey-comb; while the remainder &s;erves for the bee's own nouri&s;hment: for, during &s;ummer, it never touches what has been laid up for the winter. The &s;ting, which &s;erves to defend this little ani|mal from its enemies, is compo&s;ed of three parts; the &s;heath, and two darts, which are extremely &s;mall and penetrating. Both the darts have &s;everal &s;mall points or barbs, like tho&s;e of a fi&s;h-hook, which render the &s;ting more painful, and make the darts rankle in the wound. Still, however, this in&s;trument would be very &s;light, did not the bee poi&s;on the wound. The &s;heath, which has a &s;harp point, makes the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion; which is fol|lowed by that of the darts, and then the vene|mous liquor is poured in. The &s;heath &s;ome|times &s;ticks &s;o fa&s;t in the wound, that the ani|mal is obliged to leave it behind; by which the bee &s;oon after dies, and the wound is con|&s;iderably enflamed. It might at fir&s;t appear well for mankind, if the bee were without its &s;ting: but, upon recollection, it will be found, that the little animal would then have too ma|ny rivals in &s;haring its labours. An hundred other lazy animals, fond of honey, and hating labour, would intrude upon the &s;weets of the hive; and the trea&s;ure would be carried off, for want of armed guardians to protect it.</P>
<P>From examining the bee &s;ingly, we now come to con&s;ider it in &s;ociety, as an animal not only &s;ubject to laws, but active, vigilant, la|borious, and di&s;intere&s;ted. All its provi&s;ions
<PB N="65" REF="028539_0066_0FD9399B8FA0C350">
are laid up for the community; and all its arts in building a cell, de&s;igned for the benefit of po&s;terity. The &s;ub&s;tance with which bees build their cells is wax: which is fa&s;hioned into con|venient apartments for them&s;elves and their young. When they begin to work in their hives, they divide them&s;elves into four com|panies: one of which roves in the fields in &s;earch of materials; another employs it&s;elf in laying out the bottom and partitions of their cells; a third is employed in making the in&s;ide &s;mooth from the corners and angles; and the fourth company bring food for the re&s;t, or re|lieve tho&s;e who return with their re&s;pective bur|thens. But they are not kept con&s;tant to one employment; they often change the ta&s;ks a&s;|&s;igned them: tho&s;e that have been at work, being permitted to go abroad; and tho&s;e that have been in the fields already, take their places. They &s;eem even to have &s;igns, by which they under&s;tand each other; for when any of them want food, it bends down its trunk to the bee from whom it is expected, which then opens its honey-bag, and lets &s;ome drops fall into the other's mouth, which is at that time opened to receive it. Their diligence and labour is &s;o great, that, in a day's time, they are able to make cells, which lie upon each other, numerous enough to contain three thou&s;and bees.</P>
<P>If we examine their cells, they will be found formed in the exacte&s;t proportion. It was &s;aid by Pappus, an ancient geometrician, that, of all other figures, hexagons were the mo&s;t con|venient;
<PB N="66" REF="028539_0067_0FD9395157B30FF8">
for, when placed touching each other the mo&s;t convenient room would be given, and the &s;malle&s;t lo&s;t. The cells of the bees are perfect hexagons: the&s;e, in every honey-comb, are double, opening on either &s;ide, and clo&s;ed at the bottom. The bottoms are compo&s;ed of little triangular panes, which, when united together, terminate in a point, and lie exactly upon the extremities of other panes of the &s;ame &s;hape, in oppo&s;ite cells. The&s;e lodgings have &s;paces, like &s;treets, between them, large enough to give the bees a free pa&s;&s;age in and out; and yet narrow enough to pre&s;erve the nece&s;&s;ary heat. The mouth of every cell is defended by a border, which makes the door a little le&s;s than the in&s;ide of the cell, which &s;erves to &s;trengthen the whole. The&s;e cells &s;erve for different purpo&s;es: for laying up their young; for their wax, which in winter becomes a part of their food; and for their honey, which makes their principal &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>It is well known that the habitation of bees ought to be very clo&s;e; and what their hives want, from the negligence and un&s;kilfulne&s;s of man, the&s;e animals &s;upply by their own in|du&s;try: &s;o that it is their principal care, when fir&s;t hived, to &s;top up all the crannies. For this purpo&s;e they make u&s;e of a re&s;inous gum, which is more tenacious than wax, and differs greatly from it. This the ancients called Pro|polis: it will grow con&s;iderably hard in June; though it will in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;often by heat; and is often found different in con&s;i&s;tence, co|lour and &s;mell. It has generally an agreeable aromatic odour when it is warmed; and by
<PB N="67" REF="028539_0068_0FD9399D6EBE79F8">
&s;ome it is con&s;idered as a mo&s;t grateful perfume. When the bees begin to work with it, it is &s;oft, but it acquires a firmer con&s;i&s;tence every day; till at length it a&s;&s;umes a brown colour, and becomes much harder than wax. The bees car|ry it on their hinder legs; and &s;ome think it is met with on the birch, the willow, and pop|lar. However it is procured, it is certain that they plai&s;ter the in&s;ide of their hives with this compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>If examined through a gla&s;s hive, from the hurry the whole &s;warm is in, the whole at fir&s;t appears like anarchy and confu&s;ion; but the &s;pectator &s;oon finds every animal diligently employed, and following one pur&s;uit, with a &s;ettled purpo&s;e. Their teeth are the in&s;tru|ments by which they model and fa&s;hion their various buildings, and give them &s;uch &s;ymme|try and perfection. They begin at the top of the hive; and &s;everal of them work at a time, at the cells which have two faces. If they are &s;tinted with regard to time, they give the new cells but half the depth which they ought to have; leaving them imperfect, till they have &s;ketched out the number of cells nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. The con&s;truction of their combs, co&s;ts them a great deal of labour: they are made by in&s;en&s;ible additions; and not ca&s;t at once in a mold, as &s;ome are apt to imagine. There &s;eems no end of their &s;haping, fini&s;hing, and turning them neatly up. The cells for their young are mo&s;t carefully formed; tho&s;e de&s;igned for lodging the drones, are larger than the re&s;t; and that for the queen-bee, the lar|ge&s;t of all. The cells in which the young
<PB N="68" REF="028539_0069_0FD9395331EF0520">
brood are lodged, &s;erve at different times for containing honey; and this proceeds from an obvious cau&s;e: every worm, before it is tran&s;|formed into an aurelia, hangs its old &s;kin on the partitions of its cell; and thus, while it &s;trengthens the wall, dimini&s;hes the capacity of its late apartment. The &s;ame cell, in a &s;ingle &s;ummer, is often tenanted by three or four worms in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and the next &s;ea&s;on, by three or four more. Each worm takes particu|lar care to fortify the pannels of its cell, by hanging up its &s;poils there: thus, the partitions being lined, &s;ix or eight deep, become at la&s;t too narrow for a new brood, and are converted into &s;tore-hou&s;es, for honey.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e cells where nothing but honey is de|po&s;ited, are much deeper than the re&s;t. When the harve&s;t of honey is &s;o plentiful that they have not &s;ufficient room for it, they either lengthen their combs, or build more; which are much longer than the former. Sometimes they work at three combs at a time; &s;or, when there are three work-hou&s;es, more bees may be thus employed, without embarra&s;&s;ment.</P>
<P>But honey, as was before ob&s;erved, is not the only food upon which the&s;e animals &s;ub&s;i&s;t. The meal of flowers, of which their wax is formed, is one of their mo&s;t favourite repa&s;ts. This is a diet which they live upon during the &s;ummer; and of which they lay up a large win|ter provi&s;ion. The wax of which their comb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> are made, is no more than this meal dige&s;ted, and wrought into a pa&s;te. When the flowers upon which bees generally feed, are not fully blown, and this meal or du&s;t is not offered in
<PB N="69" REF="028539_0070_0FD939A1BB5B6B58">
&s;ufficient quantities, the bees pinch the tops of the &s;tamina in which it is contained, with their teeth; and thus anticipate the progre&s;s of vegetation. In April and May, the bees are bu&s;y, from morning to evening, in gathering this meal; but when the weather becomes too hot in the mid&s;t of &s;ummer, they work only in the morning.</P>
<P>The bee is furni&s;hed with a &s;tomach for its wax, as well as its honey. In the former of the two, their powder is altered, dige&s;ted and concocted into real wax; and is thus ejected by the &s;ame pa&s;&s;age by which it was &s;wallowed. Every comb, newly made, is white: but it be|comes yellow as it grows old, and almo&s;t black when kept too long in the hive. Be&s;ide the wax thus dige&s;ted, there is a large portion of the powder kneaded up for food in every hive, and kept in &s;eparate cells, for winter provi|&s;ion. This is called, by the country people, bee-bread; and contributes to the health and &s;trength of the animal during winter. Tho&s;e who rear bees, may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ob them of their honey, and feed them, during the winter, with treacle; but no proper &s;ub&s;titute has yet been found for the bee-bread; and, without it, the ani|mals become con&s;umptive and die.</P>
<P>As for the honey, it is extracted from that part of the flower called the nectareum. From the mouth this delicious &s;luid pa&s;&s;es into the gullet: and then into the fir&s;t &s;tomach, or ho|ney-bag, which, when filled, appears like an oblong bladder. Children, that live in coun|try places, are well acquainted with this blad|der; and de&s;troy many bees to come at their
<PB N="70" REF="028539_0071_0FD93954B2F9AAD8">
&s;tore of honey. When a bee has &s;ufficiently filled its fir&s;t &s;tomach, it returns back to the hive, where it di&s;gorges the honey into one of the cells. It often happens that the bee deli|vers its &s;tore to &s;ome other, at the mouth of the hive, and flies off for a fre&s;h &s;upply. Some honey-combs are always left open for common u&s;e; but many others are &s;topped up, till there is a nece&s;&s;ity of opening them. Each of the&s;e are covered carefully with wax; &s;o clo&s;e, that the covers &s;eem to be made at the very in&s;tant the fluid is depo&s;ited within them.</P>
<P>Having thus given a curfory de&s;cription of the in&s;ect, individually con&s;idered, and of the habitation it forms, we next come to its &s;ocial habits and in&s;titutions: and, in con&s;idering this little animal attentively, after the nece&s;&s;ary precautions for the immediate pre&s;ervation of the community, its &s;econd care is turned to the continuance of po&s;terity. How numerous &s;o|ever the multitude of bees may appear in one &s;warm, yet they all owe their original to a &s;in|gle parent, which is called the queen-bee. It is indeed &s;urpri&s;ing that a &s;ingle in&s;ect &s;hall, in one &s;ummer, give birth to above twenty thou|&s;and young: but, upon opening her body, the wonder will cea&s;e; as the number of eggs ap|pearing, at one time, amounts to five thou&s;and. This animal, who&s;e exi&s;tence is of &s;uch impor|tance to her &s;ubjects, may ea&s;ily be di&s;tingui&s;h|ed from the re&s;t, by her &s;ize, and the &s;hape of her body. On her &s;afety depends the whole welfare of the commonwealth; and the atten|tions paid her by all the re&s;t of the &s;warm, evi|dently &s;how the dependence her &s;ubjects have
<PB N="71" REF="028539_0072_0FD93A143956F480">
upon her &s;ecurity. If this in&s;ect be carefully ob&s;erved, &s;he will be &s;een at times attended with a numerous retinue, marching from cell to cell, plunging the extremity of her body into many of them, and leaving a &s;mall egg in each. When the queen-bee has depo&s;ited the number of eggs nece&s;&s;ary in the cells, the working bees undertake the care of the ri&s;ing po&s;terity. They are &s;een to leave off their u&s;ual employments; to con&s;truct proper receptacles for eggs; or to complete tho&s;e that are already formed. They purpo&s;ely build little cells, extremely &s;olid, for the young; in which they employ a great deal of wax: tho&s;e de&s;igned for lodging the males, as was already ob&s;erve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> are larger than the re&s;t; and tho&s;e for the queen-bees the lar|ge&s;t of all. There is u&s;ually but one egg de|po&s;ited in every cell. A day or two after it is depo&s;ited, the worm is excluded from the &s;hell of the egg, having the appearance of a maggot rolled up in a ring, and lying &s;oftly on a bed of a whiti&s;h coloured jelly; upon which al&s;o the little animal begins to feed. In the mean time, the in&s;tant it appears, the working bees attend it with the mo&s;t anxious and parental tenderne&s;s; they furni&s;h it every hour with a &s;upply of this whiti&s;h &s;ub&s;tance, on which it feeds and lies; and watch the cell with unre|mitting care. They are nur&s;es that have a greater affection for the offspring of others, than many parents have for their own children. They are con&s;tant in vi&s;iting each cell, and &s;ee|ing that nothing is wanting; preparing the white mixture, which is nothing but a compo|&s;ition
<PB N="72" REF="028539_0073_0FD93959946F1440">
of honey and wax, in their own bowels, with which they feed them. Thus attended, and plentifully fed, the worm, in le&s;s than &s;ix days time, comes to its full growth, and no longer accepts the food offered it. When the bees perceive that it has no further occa&s;ion for feeding, they perform the la&s;t offices of tend|erne&s;s, and &s;hut the little animal up in its cell; walling up the mouth of its apartment with wax: there they leave the worm to it&s;elf; hav|ing &s;ecured it from every external injury.</P>
<P>The worm is no &s;ooner left enclo&s;ed, but, from a &s;tate of inaction, it begins to labour, ex|tending and &s;hortening its body; and by this means lining th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> walls of its apartment with a &s;ilken tape&s;try, which it &s;pins in the manner of caterpillars, before they undergo their la&s;t transformation. When their cell is thus pre|pared, the animal is &s;oon after transformed in|to an aurelia; but differing from that of the common caterpillar, as it exhibits not only the legs, but the wings of the future bee, in its pre&s;ent &s;tate of inactivity. Thus, in about twenty, or one and twenty days after the egg was laid, the bee is completely formed, and fitted to undergo the fatigues of its &s;tate. When all its parts have acquired their proper &s;trength and con&s;i&s;tence, the young animal opens its pri&s;on, by piercing with its teeth the waxen door that confines it. When ju&s;t freed from its cell, it is as yet moi&s;t, and incommoded with the &s;poils of its former &s;ituation; but the officious bees are &s;oon &s;een to flo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> round it, and to lick it clean on all &s;ides with their trunks; while another band, with equal a&s;&s;iduity, are
<PB N="73" REF="028539_0074_0FD939A483FBCE50">
ob&s;erved to feed it with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ey: others again begin immediately to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the cell that has been ju&s;t left; to carry the ordures out of the hive, and to fit the place for a new inhabitant. The young bee &s;oon repays their care, by its indu&s;try; for as &s;oon as ever its external parts become dry, it di&s;covers its natural appetites for labour, and indu&s;triou&s;ly begins the ta&s;k, which it pur&s;ues unremittingly through life. The toil of man is irk&s;ome to him, and he earns his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence with pain; but this little animal &s;eems happy in its pur&s;uits, and finds delight in all its employments.</P>
<P>When bees fir&s;t begin to break their pri&s;ons, there are generally above a hundred excluded in one day. Thus, in the &s;pace of a few weeks, the number of the inhabitants in one hive, of moderate &s;ize, becomes &s;o great, that there is no place to contain the new comers; and they are &s;carcely excluded from the cell, when they are obliged, by the old bees, to &s;ally forth in que&s;t of new habitations. In other words, the hive begins to &s;warm, and the new progeny prepares for exile.</P>
<P>While there is room enough in the hive, the bees remain quietly together; it is nece&s;&s;ity alone that compels the &s;eparation. Sometimes indeed, the young brood, with gracele&s;s ob&s;ti|nacy, refu&s;e to depart, and even venture to re&s;i&s;t their progenitors. The young ones are known by being browner than the old, with whiter hair; the old ones are of a lighter co|lour, with red hair. The two armies are there|fore ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hable, and dreadful battles are often &s;een to en&s;ue. But the victory al|mo&s;t

<P>In different countries, the &s;warms make their appearance at different times of the year, and there are &s;everal &s;igns previous to this intended migration. The night before, an unu&s;ual buz|ing is heard in the hive; in the morning, though the weather be &s;oft and inviting, they &s;eem not to obey the call, being intent on more important meditations within. All labour is di&s;continued in the hive, every bee is either employed in forcing, or reluctantly yielding a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; at length, after &s;ome noi&s;e and tumult, a queen-bee is cho&s;en, to guard, ra|ther than conduct, the young colony to other habitations, and then they are mar&s;halled with|out any apparent conductor. In le&s;s than a mi|nute, they leave their native abode, and form|ing a cloud round their protectre&s;s, they &s;et off, without &s;eeming to know the place of their de&s;tination; <HI>The world before them, where to choo&s;e their place of re&s;t.</HI> The u&s;ual time of &s;warming, is from ten in the morning, to three in the afternoon, when the &s;un <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> bright, and invites them to &s;eek their fortunes. They flutter for a while, in the air, like flakes of &s;now, and &s;ometimes undertake a di&s;tant jour|ney, but more frequently are contented with &s;ome neighbouring a&s;ylum; the branch of a tree, a chimney top, or &s;ome other expo&s;ed &s;it|uation. It is, indeed, remarkable, that all tho&s;e animals, of whatever kind, that have long been under the protection of man, &s;eem
<PB N="75" REF="028539_0076_0FD939A60300C0C8">
to lo&s;e a part of their natural &s;agacity, in pro|viding for them&s;elves. The rabbit, when do|me&s;ticated, forgets to dig holes, the hen to build a ne&s;t, and the bee to &s;eek a &s;helter, that &s;hall protect it from the inclemencies of winter. In tho&s;e countries, where the bees are wild, and unprotected by man, they are always &s;ure to build their waxen cells in the hollow of a tree; but with us, they &s;eem im|provident in their choice, and the fir&s;t green branch that &s;tops their flight, &s;eems to be thought &s;ufficient for their abode through win|ter.

When the queen is &s;ettled, the re&s;t of the &s;warm &s;oon follow; and, in about a quarter of an hour, the whole body &s;eem to be at ea&s;e. It &s;ometimes is found, that there are two or three queens to a &s;warm, and the colony is divided into parties; but it mo&s;t u&s;ually happens, that one of the&s;e is more con&s;iderable than the other, and the bees by degrees, de&s;ert the weake&s;t, to take &s;helter under the mo&s;t powerful protector. The de|&s;erted queen does not long &s;urvive this defeat; &s;he takes refuge under the new monarch, and is &s;oon de&s;troyed by her jealous rival. Till this cruel execution is performed, the bees ne|ver go out to work; and if there &s;hould be a queen-bee, belonging to the new colony, left

in the old hive, &s;he always undergoes the fate of the former. However, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the bees never &s;acrifice any of their queens, when the hive is full of wax and honey; for there is at that time, no danger in maintaining a plurality of breeders.</P>
<P>When the &s;warm is thus conducted to a place of re&s;t, and the policy of government is &s;ettled, the bees &s;oon re&s;ume their former labours.</P>
<P>When a hive &s;ends out &s;everal &s;warms in the year, the fir&s;t is always the be&s;t, and the mo&s;t numerous. The&s;e, having the whole &s;ummer before them, have the more time for making wax and honey, and con&s;equently their labours are the mo&s;t valuable to the proprietor. Al|though the &s;warm chiefly con&s;i&s;ts of the young|e&s;t bees, yet it is often found, that bees of all ages compo&s;e the multitude of emigrants, and it often happens, that bees of all ages are &s;een remaining behind. The number of them is always more con&s;iderable than that of &s;ome po|pulous cities, for &s;ometimes upwards of forty thou&s;and are found in a &s;ingle hive. So large a body may well be &s;uppo&s;ed to work with great expedition; and in fact, in le&s;s than twent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> four hours, they will make combs above twenty inches long, and &s;even or eight broad. Some|times they will half fill their hives with wax, in le&s;s than five days. In the fir&s;t fifteen days, they are always found to make more wax than they do afterwards during the re&s;t of the year.</P>
<P>Having mentioned the indu&s;try of the&s;e ad|mirable in&s;ects, it will be proper to &s;ay &s;ome|thing of the effects of their labour, of that wax and honey, which are turned by man to &s;uch
<PB N="77" REF="028539_0078_0FD939A77B6FD5E8">
various u&s;es. Bees gather together two kinds of wax, one coar&s;e and the other fine. The coar&s;er &s;ort is bitter, and with this, which is called <HI>propolis,</HI> they &s;top up all the holes and crevices of their hives. It is of a more re&s;inous nature than the fine wax, and is con&s;equently better qualified to re&s;i&s;t the moi&s;ture of the &s;ea&s;on, and pre&s;erve the works warm and dry within. The fine wax is as nece&s;&s;ary to the animals pre&s;ervation as the honey it&s;elf. With this they make their lodgings, with this they cover the cells of their young, and in this they lay up their magazines of honey. This is made, as has been already ob&s;erved, from the du&s;t of flowers, which is carefully kneaded by the lit|tle in&s;ect, then &s;wallowed, and having under|gone a kind of dige&s;tion, is formed into the cells, which an&s;wers &s;uch a variety of purpo&s;es. To collect this, the animal rolls it&s;elf in the flower it would rob, and thus takes up the ve|getable du&s;t with the hair of its body. Then carefully bru&s;hing it into a lump, with its fore|paws it thru&s;ts the compo&s;ition into two cavi|ties behind the thighs, which are made like &s;poons to receive the wax, and the hair that lines them, &s;erves to keep it from falling.</P>
<P>As of wax, there are al&s;o two kinds of ho|ney. The white and the yellow. The white is taken without fire from the honey-combs. The yellow is extracted by heat, and &s;queezed through bags, in a pre&s;s. The be&s;t honey is new, thick and granulated, of a clear tran&s;pa|rent white colour, of a &s;oft and aromatic &s;mell, and of a &s;weet lively ta&s;te. Honey made in mountainous countries, is preferable to that of
<PB N="78" REF="028539_0079_0FD939AD9279DFA8">
the valley. The honey made in the &s;pring, is more highly e&s;teemed, than that gathered in &s;ummer, which la&s;t is &s;till more valuable, than that of autumn, when the flowers begin to fade and lo&s;e their fragrance.</P>

<HEAD>Of the SILKWORM.</HEAD>
<P>THIS little creature, which only works for it&s;elf, has been made of the utmo&s;t &s;ervice to man; and furni&s;hes him with a cover|ing more beautiful than any other animal can &s;upply. We may declaim indeed again&s;t the luxuries of the times, when &s;ilk is &s;o generally worn; but were &s;uch garments to fail, what other arts could &s;upply their deficiency?</P>
<P>Though &s;ilk was anciently brought in &s;mall quantities to Rome, yet it was &s;o &s;carce as to be &s;old for its weight in gold; and was con&s;i|dered as &s;uch a luxurious refinement in dre&s;s, that it was infamous for a man to appear in ha|bits of which &s;ilk formed but half the compo|&s;ition. It was mo&s;t probably brought among them from the remote&s;t parts of the ea&s;t; &s;ince it was, at that time of which I am &s;peaking, &s;carcely known even in Per&s;ia.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more remote from the truth, than the manner in which their hi&s;torians de|&s;cribe the animal by which &s;ilk is produced. Pau&s;anius informs us, that &s;ilk came from the country of the Seres, a people of A&s;iatic Scy|thia;
<PB N="97" REF="028539_0080_0FD939AF74BA8518">
in which place an in&s;ect, as large as the beetle, but in every other re&s;pect re&s;embling a &s;pider, was bred up for that purpo&s;e. They take great care, as he a&s;&s;ures us, to feed and defend it from the weather; as well during the &s;ummer's heat, as the rigours of winter. This in&s;ect, he ob&s;erves, makes its web with its feet, of which it has eight in number. It is fed, for the &s;pace of four years, upon a kind of pa&s;te, prepared for it; and at the beginning of the fifth, it is &s;upplied with leaves of the green willow, of which it is particularly fond; it then feeds till it bur&s;ts with fat: after which they take out its bowels, which are &s;pun into the beautiful manufacture &s;o &s;carce and co&s;tly.</P>
<P>The real hi&s;tory of this animal was unknown among the Romans till the times of Ju&s;tinian; and it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that &s;ilkworms were not brought into Europe till the beginning of the twelfth century; when Roger of Sicily, brought workmen in this manufacture from A&s;ia Minor, after his return from his expedition to the Ho|ly Land, and &s;ettled them in Sicily and Cala|bria. From the&s;e the other kingdoms of Eu|rope learned this manufacture; and it is now one of the mo&s;t lucrative carried on among the &s;outhern provinces of Europe.</P>
<P>The &s;ilkworm is now very well known to be a large caterpillar, of a whiti&s;h colour, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">welve feet, and producing a butterfly of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oth kind.

<PB N="80" REF="028539_0081_0FD939B0C1D2B878">
&s;ilk. The feeding the&s;e worms, the gathering, the winding, the twi&s;ting, and the weaving their &s;ilk, is one of the principal manufactures of Europe; and, as their luxuries increa&s;e, &s;eems every day to become more and more nece&s;&s;ary to human happine&s;s.</P>
<P>There are two methods of breeding &s;ilk|worms; for they may be left to grow, and re|main at liberty upon the trees where they are hatched; or they may be kept in a place built for that purpo&s;e, and fed every day with fre&s;h leaves. The fir&s;t method is u&s;ed in China, Tonquin, and other hot countries; the other is u&s;ed in other places where the animal has been artificially propagated, and &s;till continues <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;tranger. In the warm climate, the &s;ilk|worm proceeds from an egg, which has been glued by the parent moth upon proper parts of the mulberry-tree, and which remains in that &s;ituation during the winter. The manner in which they are &s;ituated and fixed to the tree, keeps them unaffected by the influence of the weather; &s;o that tho&s;e fro&s;ts which are &s;evere enough to kill the tree, have no power to in|jure the &s;ilkworm.</P>
<P>The in&s;ect never proceeds from the egg till Nature has provided it a &s;ufficient &s;upply; and till the budding leav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> are furni&s;hed, in &s;uf|ficient abundance, for its &s;upport. When the leaves are put forth, the worms &s;eem to feel the genial &s;ummons, and bur&s;ting from their little eggs, crawl upon the leaves, where they feed with a mo&s;t voracious appetite. Thus they become larger by degrees; and after &s;ome months feeding, they lay, upon every leaf,
<PB N="81" REF="028539_0082_0FD939B7CD2EF448">
&s;mall bundles, or cones of &s;ilk, which appear like &s;o many golden apples, painted on a fine green ground. Such is the method of breed|ing them in the Ea&s;t; and without doubt it is be&s;t for the worms, and lea&s;t trouble&s;ome for the feeder of them. But it is otherwi&s;e in the colder European climates; the frequent chan|ges of the weather, and the heavy dews of the evenings render the keeping them all night ex|po&s;ed, &s;ubject to &s;o many inconveniences, as to admit of no remedy. It is true, that by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ets, they may be pre&s;erved from the in&s;ults of birds; but the &s;evere cold weather, which often &s;ucceeds the fir&s;t heats of &s;ummer, as well as the rain and high winds, will de&s;troy them all: and therefore, to breed them in Europe, they mu&s;t be &s;heltered and protected from every external injury.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e, a room is cho&s;en, with a &s;outh a&s;pect; and the windows are &s;o well gla|zed, as not to admit the lea&s;t air: the walls are well built, and the planks of the floor ex|ceeding clo&s;e &s;o as to admit neither birds nor mice, not even &s;o much as an infect. In the middle there &s;hould be four pillars erected, or four wooden po&s;ts, &s;o placed as to form a pret|ty large &s;quare. Between the&s;e are different &s;tories made with ozier hurdles; and under each hurdle there &s;hould be a floor, with an upright border all round. The&s;e hurdles and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">loors mu&s;t hang upon pullies, &s;o as to be pla|ced or taken down at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>When the worms are hatched, &s;ome tender mulberry leaves are provided, and placed in the cloth or paper box in which the eggs were
<PB N="82" REF="028539_0083_0FD939B8C0970BF8">
laid, and which are large enough to hold a great number. When they have acquired &s;ome &s;trength, they mu&s;t be di&s;tributed on beds of mulberry leaves, in the different &s;tories of the &s;quare in the middle of the room, round which a per&s;on may freely pa&s;s on every &s;ide. They will fix them&s;elves to the leaves, and af|terwards to the &s;ticks of the hurdles, when the leaves are devoured. They have then a thread, by which they can &s;u&s;pend them&s;elves on occa|&s;ion, to prevent any &s;hock by a fall; but this is by no means to be con&s;idered as the &s;ilk which they &s;pin afterwards in &s;uch abundance. Care mu&s;t be taken that fre&s;h leaves be brought every morning, which mu&s;t be &s;trewed very gently and equally over them; upon which the &s;ilkworms will for&s;ake the remainder of the old leaves, which mu&s;t be carefully taken away, and every thing kept very clean; for nothing hurts the&s;e infects &s;o much as moi&s;ture and uncleanline&s;s. For this rea&s;on their leaves mu&s;t be gathered when the weather is dry, and kept in a dry place, if it be nece&s;&s;ary to lay in a &s;tore. As the&s;e animals have but a &s;hort time to live, they make u&s;e of every moment, and almo&s;t continually are &s;pinning except at tho&s;e intervals when they change their &s;kins. If mulberry leaves be difficult to be obtained, the leaves of lettuce or holy oak will &s;u&s;tain them: but they do not thrive &s;o well upon their new diet; and their &s;ilk will neither be &s;o copious, nor of &s;o good a quality.</P>
<P>Though the judicious choice, and careful management of their diet, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary, yet there is another precaution of equal
<PB N="83" REF="028539_0084_0FD939BA82351FE0">
importance, which is to give them air, and open their chamber windows, at &s;uch times as the &s;un &s;hines warme&s;t. The place al&s;o mu&s;t be kept as clean as po&s;&s;ible; not only the &s;eve|ral floors that are laid to receive their ordure, but the whole apartments in general. The&s;e things well ob&s;erved, contribute greatly to their health and encrea&s;e.</P>
<P>The worm, at the time it bur&s;ts the &s;hell, is extremely &s;mall, and of a black colour; but the head is of a more &s;hining black than the re&s;t of the body: &s;ome days after, they begin to turn whiti&s;h, or of an a&s;h-coloured grey. After the &s;kin begins to grow too rigid, or the animal is &s;tinted within it, the in&s;ect throws it off, and appears cloathed a-new: it then becomes larger and much whiter, though it has a greeni&s;h ca&s;t: after &s;ome days, which are more or le&s;s, according to the different heat of the climate, or to the quality of the food it leaves off eating, and &s;eems to &s;leep for two days together: then it begins to &s;tir, and put it&s;elf into violent motions, till the &s;kin falls off the &s;econd time, and is thrown a&s;ide by the ani|mal's feet. All the&s;e changes are made in three weeks or a month's time; after which it be|gins to feed once more, &s;till in its caterpillar form, but a good deal differing from it&s;elf be|fore its change. In a few days time it &s;eems to &s;leep again; and, when it awakes, it again changes its cloathing, and continues feeding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s before. When it has thus taken a &s;uffici|ency of food, and its parts are di&s;po&s;ed for a&s;|&s;uming the aurelia form, the animal for&s;akes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or the la&s;t time, all food and &s;ociety, and pre|pares

it&s;elf a retreat to defend it from external injuries, while it is &s;eemingly deprived of life and motion.</P>
<P>This retreat is no other than its cone, or ball of &s;ilk, which Nature has taught it to compo&s;e with great art; and within which it buries it&s;elf, till it a&s;&s;umes its winged form. This cone or ball is &s;pun from two little long|i&s;h kinds of bags that lie above the inte&s;tines, and are filled with a gummy fluid, of a mari|gold colour. This is the &s;ub&s;tance of which the threads are formed; and the little animal is furni&s;hed with a &s;urpri&s;ing apparatus for &s;pinning it to the degree of finene&s;s which its occa&s;ions may require. This in&s;trument in &s;ome mea&s;ure re&s;embles a wire-drawer's ma|chine, in which gold or &s;ilver threads are drawn to any degree of minutene&s;s; and through this the animal draws its thread with great a&s;&s;idu|ity. As every thread proceeds from two gum-bags, it is probable that each &s;upplies its own; which, however, are united, as they proceed from the animal's body. If we examine the thread with a micro&s;cope, it will be found that it is flatted on one &s;ide, and grooved along its length; from hence we may infer, that it is doubled ju&s;t upon leaving the body; and that the two threads &s;tick to each other by that gummy quality of which they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Previous to &s;pinning its web, the &s;ilkworm &s;eeks out &s;ome convenient place to erect its cel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, without any ob&s;truction. When it has found a leaf, or a chink fitted to its purpo&s;e, it be|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to wreathe its head in every direction, and fa&s;tens its thread on every &s;ide to the &s;ides of
<PB N="85" REF="028539_0086_0FD939C1E9122130">
its retreat. Though all its fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays &s;eem perfectly confu&s;ed, yet they are not altogether without de&s;ign: there appears indeed, no or|der or contrivance in the di&s;po&s;al of its fir&s;t threads; they are by no means laid artfully over each other, but are thrown out at random, to &s;erve as an external &s;helter again&s;t rain; for nature having appointed the animal to work upon trees in the open air, its habits remain, though it is brought up in a warm apartment.</P>
<P>Malpighi pretends to have ob&s;erved &s;ix dif|ferent layers in a &s;ingle cone of &s;ilk: but what may ea&s;ily be ob&s;erved is, that it is compo&s;ed externally of a kind of rough cotton-like &s;ub|&s;tance, which is called flo&s;s; within the thread it is more di&s;tinct and even; and next the body of the aurelia, the apartment &s;eems lined with a &s;ub&s;tance of the hardne&s;s of paper, but of a much &s;tronger con&s;i&s;tence. It mu&s;t not be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the thread which goes to com|po&s;e the cone, is rolled round, as we roll a bottom; on the contrary, it lies upon it in a very irregular manner, and winds off from one &s;ide of the cone, and then from the other. This whole thread, if mea&s;ured, will be found about three hundred yards long; and &s;o very fine, that eight or ten of them are generally rolled off into one by the manufacturers. The cone, when completed, is in form like a pi|geon's egg, and more pointed at one end than the other; at the &s;maller end, the head of the aurelia is generally found; and this is the pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e that the in&s;ect, when converted into a moth, is generally &s;een to bur&s;t through.</P>
<P>It is generally a fortnight or three weeks be|fore
<PB N="86" REF="028539_0087_0FD939C598115C98">
the aurelia is changed into a moth; but no &s;ooner is the winged in&s;ect completely form|ed, than having dive&s;ted it&s;elf of its aurelia &s;kin, it p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">pares to bur&s;t through its cone, or outward pri&s;on: for this purpo&s;e it extends its head towa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ds the point of the cone, butts with its eyes, which are rough, again&s;t the lining of its cell, wears it away, and at la&s;t pu&s;hes forward, through a pa&s;&s;age which is &s;mall at fir&s;t, but which enlarges as the anim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> encrea&s;es its efforts for emancipation; while <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tered remnants of its aurelia &s;kin lie in confu&s;ion within the cone, like a bundle of dirty linen.</P>
<P>The animal, when thus &s;et free from its double confinement, appears exhau&s;ted with fatigue, and &s;eems produced for no other pur|po&s;e but to tran&s;mit a future brood. It nei|ther flies nor eats; the male only &s;eeking the female, who&s;e eggs he impregnates; and their union continues for four days, without inter|ruption. The male dies immediately after &s;e|paration from his mate; and &s;he &s;urvives him only till &s;he has laid her eggs, which are not hatched into worms till the en&s;uing &s;pring.</P>
<P>However, there are few of the&s;e animals &s;uffered to come to a &s;tate of maturity; for as their bur&s;ting through the cone de&s;troys the &s;ilk, the manufacturers take care to kill the au|relia, by expo&s;ing it to the &s;un, before the moth comes to perfection. This done, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> off the flo&s;s, and throw the cones into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> water, &s;tirring them till the fir&s;t thread offe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> them a clue for winding all off.

a proper quantity of the &s;ilk is wound off: however, they do not take all; for the latter parts grow weak, and are of a bad colour. As to the paper-like &s;ub&s;tance which remains, &s;ome &s;tain it with a variety of colours, to make artificial flowers; others let it lie in the water, till the glutinous matter which cements it is all di&s;&s;olved: it is then carded like wool, &s;pun with a wheel, and converted into &s;ilk &s;tuffs of an inferior kind.</P>
