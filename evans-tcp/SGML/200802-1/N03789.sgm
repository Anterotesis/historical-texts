<Q><HI>If any Man be in Chri&s;t, he is a new Creature.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Doctrine of our REGENERATION, or NEW BIRTH in CHRIST JESUS, tho' one of the mo&s;t fundamental Doctrines of our Holy Religion; though &s;o plainly and often pre&s;&s;ed on us in &s;acred Writ, <Q>that he that runs may read;</Q> nay, though it is the very Hinge on which the Salvation of each of us turns, and a Point too in which all <HI>&s;incere</HI> Chri&s;tians, of whatever Denomination, agree; yet is &s;o &s;el|dom con&s;idered, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> little <HI>experimentally</HI> un|der&s;tood by the Generality of Profe&s;&s;ors, that were we to judge of the Truth of it by the <HI>Ex|perience</HI> of mo&s;t who call them&s;elves <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> we &s;hould be apt to imagine they had "not &s;o much as heard" whether there be any &s;uch Thing as Regeneration or no, It is true, Men, for the mo&s;t Part are Orthodox in the common
<PB N="2" REF="004650_0005_100DDA66D8DD95D8">
Articles of their Creed; they believe there is but one GOD, and one Mediator between GOD and Man, even the Man CHRIST JESUS; and that there is no other Name given under Heaven, whereby they can be &s;aved, be&s;ides his: But then tell them, They mu&s;t be REGE|NERATE, they mu&s;t be BORN AGAIN, they mu&s;t be renewed in the very <HI>Spirit, i. e.</HI> in the <HI>inmo&s;t</HI> Faculties of their Minds, e'er they can truly call CHRIST <HI>Lord, Lord</HI> or have any Share in the Merits of his precious Blood; and they are ready to cry out wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> <Q>How can the&s;e Things be?</Q> Or with the <HI>Atheni|ans,</HI> on another Occa&s;ion, <Q>What will this Babler &s;ay? He &s;eemeth to be a Setter-forth of &s;trange Doctrines, becau&s;e we preach unto them CHRIST, and the New-Birth.</Q></P>
<P>That I may therefore contribute my Mite to|wards curing the fatal Mi&s;take of &s;uch Per&s;ons, who would thus put a&s;under what GOD has in|&s;eparably joined together, and vainly expect to be ju&s;tified by CHRIST, <HI>i. e.</HI> have their Sins forgiven, unle&s;s they are al&s;o &s;anctified, <HI>i. e.</HI> have their Natures changed, and made holy; I &s;hall beg leave to enlarge on the Words of the Text in the following Manner.</P>

<ITEM><HI>Secondly,</HI> What we are to under&s;tand by being a <HI>new Creature:</HI> <Q><HI>If any Man be in CHRIST,</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, <HI>he is a new Creature.</HI></Q></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="3" REF="004650_0006_100DDA69B26185A0">
<HI>Thirdly,</HI> I &s;hall produce &s;ome Arguments to prove <HI>Why</HI> we mu&s;t be <HI>new Creatures</HI> e'er we can be <HI>in CHRIST&punc;.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Fourthly</HI> and <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> I &s;hall draw &s;ome Infer|ences from what will have been delivered, and then conclude with a Word or two of Exhortation from the Whole.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>And <HI>fir&s;t</HI> then, I am to endeavour to explain what is meant by this Expre&s;&s;ion in the Text, <HI>If any Man be in CHRIST.</HI></P>
<P>Now a Per&s;on may be &s;aid to be <HI>in CHRIST</HI> two Ways. Fir&s;t, only by an outward Profe&s;|&s;ion. And in this Sen&s;e, every one that is called a Chri&s;tian, or baptized into CHRIST's Church, may be &s;aid to be <HI>in CHRIST.</HI> But that this is not the &s;ole Meaning of the Apo&s;tle's Phra&s;e now before us, is evident, becau&s;e then <Q>every one that names the Name of CHRIST,</Q> or is baptized into his vi&s;ible Church, would be a <HI>new Creature.</HI> Which is notoriou&s;ly fal&s;e, it being too plain, beyond all Contradiction, that comparatively but few of tho&s;e that are <HI>"born "of Water,"</HI> are <HI>born of the Spirit"</HI> likewi&s;e; or, to u&s;e another Scriptural way of &s;peaking, Many are baptized with Water, which were never, effectually at lea&s;t, baptized with the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>To be <HI>in CHRIST</HI> therefore, in the full Im|port of the Word, mu&s;t certainly mean &s;ome|thing more than a bare outward Profe&s;&s;ion, or be|ing called after his Name. For, as this &s;ame Apo&s;tle tells us, <Q>All are not <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> that are of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI></Q> i. e. when applied to Chri&s;tianity,
<PB N="4" REF="004650_0007_100DDA6C5A9DDBA8">
all are not <HI>real</HI> Chri&s;tians that are <HI>nominally</HI> &s;uch. Nay, that is &s;o far from being the Ca&s;e, that our Ble&s;&s;ed LORD him&s;elf informs us, That many that have prophe&s;ied or preached in his Name, and in his Name ca&s;t out Devils, and done many wonderful Works, &s;hall notwith&s;tanding be di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed at the la&s;t Day with <Q>a Depart from me, I know you not, ye Workers of Iniquity.</Q></P>
<P>It remains therefore, that this Expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>If any Man be in CHRIST,</HI> mu&s;t be under&s;tood in a &s;econd and clo&s;er Signification, <HI>viz.</HI> to be <HI>in him</HI> &s;o as to partake of the Benefits of his Suffer|ings. To be <HI>in him</HI> not only by an outward Profe&s;&s;ion, but by an inward Change and Purity of Heart, and Cohabitation of his holy Spirit. To be <HI>in him</HI> &s;o as to be my&s;tically united to him by a true and lively Faith, and thereby to re|ceive &s;piritual Virtue from him, as the Members of the natural Body do from the Head, or the Branches from the Vine. To be <HI>in him</HI> in &s;uch a Manner as the Apo&s;tle, &s;peaking of him&s;elf, acquaints us he knew a Per&s;on was, <HI>I know a Man in</HI> CHRIST, &s;ays he, <HI>i. e.</HI> a true Chri&s;tian; or, as he him&s;elf de&s;ires to be <HI>in</HI> CHRIST, when he wi&s;hes, in his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Philippians,</HI> that he might be found <HI>in him.</HI></P>
<P>This is undoubtedly the full Purport of the Apo&s;tle's Expre&s;&s;ions in the Words of the Text; &s;o that what he &s;ays in his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Romans</HI> about Circumci&s;ion, may very well be applied to the pre&s;ent Subject, <HI>viz.</HI> That he is not a <HI>real</HI> Chri&s;tian who is only one <HI>outwardly;</HI> nor is that true Bapti&s;m, which is only outward in the <HI>Fle&s;h.</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="004650_0008_100DDA6E9A81B888">
But he is a true Chri&s;tian, who is one <HI>inwardly,</HI> who&s;e Bapti&s;m is that of the <HI>Heart,</HI> in the <HI>Spirit,</HI> and not merely in the <HI>Water,</HI> who&s;e Prai&s;e is not of Man but of GOD. Or, as he &s;peaketh in another Place, Neither Circumci&s;ion or Un|circumci&s;ion availeth any thing of it&s;elf, but a <HI>new Creature.</HI> Which amounts to what he here declares in the Ver&s;e now under Con&s;ideration, that if any Man be truly and properly <HI>in</HI> CHRIST, he is a <HI>new Creature.</HI></P>
<P>What we are to under&s;tand by being a <HI>New Creature,</HI> was the next and <HI>&s;econd</HI> general Thing to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P>And here it is evident at the fir&s;t View, that this Expre&s;&s;ion is not to be &s;o explained as tho' there was a Phy&s;ical Change required to be made in us, <HI>i. e.</HI> as tho' we were to be reduced to our primitive <HI>Nothings,</HI> and then created and formed again. For, &s;uppo&s;ing we were, as <HI>Nicodemus</HI> ignorantly imagined, to enter a "&s;econd Time into our Mother's Womb, and be born," alas! what would it contribute towards rendring us &s;piritually <HI>new Creatures?</HI> &s;ince that which was born of Fle&s;h would be Fle&s;h &s;till, <HI>i. e.</HI> we would be the &s;ame carnal Per&s;ons as ever, being derived from carnal Parents, and con&s;equently receiving the Seeds of all Manner of Sin and Corruption from them. No, it only means, that we mu&s;t be &s;o altered as to the Qualities and Tempers of our Minds, that we mu&s;t intirely forget what Manner of Per&s;ons we once were. As it may be &s;aid of a Piece of Gold that was in the Ore, after it has been clean&s;ed, purified and poli&s;hed,
<PB N="6" REF="004650_0009_100DDA729D105E60">
that it is a new Piece of Gold; As it may be &s;aid of a bright Gla&s;s that has been covered over with Filth, when it is wiped, and &s;o become tran&s;pa|rent and clear, that it is a new Gla&s;s: Or, as it might be &s;aid of <HI>Naaman,</HI> when he recovered of his Lepro&s;y, and his Fle&s;h returned unto him like the Fle&s;h of a young Child, that he was a new Man; &s;o our Souls, tho' &s;till the &s;ame as to E&s;&s;ence, yet are &s;o purged, purified and clean|&s;ed from their natural Dro&s;s, Filth and Lepro&s;y, by the ble&s;&s;ed Influences of the Holy Spirit, that they may properly be &s;aid to be <HI>made anew.</HI></P>
<P>How this glorious Change is wrought in the Soul, cannot ea&s;ily be explained. For no One knows the Ways of the Spirit, &s;ave the Spirit of GOD Him&s;elf. Not that this ought to be any Argument again&s;t this Doctrine; for, as our Ble&s;&s;ed LORD ob&s;erved to <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> when he was di&s;cour&s;ing on this very Subject, <HI>The</HI> Wind, &s;ays he, <HI>bloweth where it li&s;teth, and thou heare&s;t the Sound thereof, but knowe&s;t not whence it cometh, and whither it goeth;</HI> and if we are told of natural Things, and we under&s;tand them not, how much le&s;s ought we to wonder, if we can|not immediately account for the invi&s;ible Work|ings of the Holy Spirit? The Truth of the Mat|ter is this: The Doctrine of our <HI>Regeneration,</HI> or <HI>New Birth</HI> in CHRIST JESUS, is "dark and hard to be under&s;tood" by the natural Man. But that there is really &s;uch a Thing, and that each of us mu&s;t be &s;piritually born again, before we can enter into the Kingdom of GOD; or, to keep to the Terms made u&s;e of in the Text, mu&s;t
<PB N="7" REF="004650_0010_100DDA75927DEEB8">
be <HI>new Creatures</HI> before we can be <HI>in</HI> CHRIST, I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew under my</P>
<P><HI>Third</HI> general Head, in which I was to pro|duce &s;ome Arguments to prove, <HI>Why</HI> we mu&s;t be <HI>new Creatures,</HI> in order to qualify us for being &s;avingly in CHRIST.</P>
<P>And here one would think it &s;ufficient to af|firm, that GOD him&s;elf, in his holy Word, hath told us &s;o. For, not to mention many Texts that might be produced out of the <HI>Old Te&s;tament</HI> to prove this Point, (and indeed, by the way, one would wonder how <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> who was a <HI>Teacher in I&s;rael,</HI> and who was therefore to in&s;truct the People in the &s;piritual Meaning of the Law, &s;hould be &s;o ignorant of this grand Ar|ticle, as we find he really was, by his a&s;king our Ble&s;&s;ed LORD, when he was pre&s;&s;ing on him this Topick, "How can the&s;e Things be?" Surely, he could not forget how often the P&s;almi&s;t had begg'd of GOD, to make him a <HI>new Heart,</HI> and <HI>renew</HI> a <HI>right Spirit</HI> within him; as like|wi&s;e, how frequently the Prophets had warned the People to make them <HI>new Hearts,</HI> and <HI>new Minds,</HI> and &s;o turn unto the LORD their GOD. But not to mention the&s;e and &s;uch like Texts out out of the <HI>Old Te&s;tament</HI>) this Doctrine is &s;o plainly and often repeated in the <HI>New,</HI> that, as I ob&s;erved before, "He that runs may read." For what &s;ays the great Prophet and In&s;tructor of the World him&s;elf? <HI>Except a Man (i. e.</HI> every one that is naturally engendred of the Offspring of <HI>Adam</HI>) <HI>be born again of Water and the Spi|rit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of GOD.</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="004650_0011_100DDA78513C8190">
And le&s;t we &s;hould be apt to &s;light this A&s;&s;ertion, and <HI>Nicodemus</HI> - like, reject the Doctrine, becau&s;e becau&s;e we cannot immediately explain, How this Thing can be; our ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter therefore affirms it, as it were, by an Oath, <HI>Verily, verily, I &s;ay unto you,</HI> or, as it may be read, I the <HI>A|men;</HI> I, who am Truth it&s;elf, &s;ay unto you, that it is the unalterable Appointment of my heavenly Father, <HI>that unle&s;s a Man be born a|gain, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>Agreeable to this are tho&s;e many Pa&s;&s;ages we meet with in the Epi&s;tles, where we are com|manded to be <HI>renewed in the Spirit, i. e.</HI> as was before explained, in the inmo&s;t Faculties of our Minds; to put off the <HI>Old Man,</HI> which is cor|rupt; and to put on the <HI>New Man,</HI> - which is created after GOD, in Righteou&s;ne&s;s and true Holine&s;s; That <HI>Old Things</HI> mu&s;t pa&s;s away, and that all Things mu&s;t become <HI>New;</HI> That we are to be &s;aved by the <HI>Wa&s;hing</HI> of <HI>Regeneration,</HI> and the <HI>Renewing</HI> of the HOLY GHOST. Or, methinks, was there no other Pa&s;&s;age to be pro|duced be&s;ides the Words of the Text, it would be full enough, &s;ince the Apo&s;tle therein po&s;itive|ly affirms, that <HI>If any Man be in CHRIST, I mu&s;t be a new Creature.</HI></P>
<P>Now what can be under&s;tood by all tho&s;e dif|ferent Terms of being <HI>born again, of putting off the Old Man,</HI> and <HI>putting on the New,</HI> of being <HI>re|newed</HI> in the <HI>Spirit</HI> of our <HI>Minds,</HI> and becoming <HI>new Creatures;</HI> but that Chri&s;tianity requires a <HI>thorough, real, inward</HI> Change of Hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">? Do we think the&s;e, and &s;uch-like Forms of &s;peaking,
<PB N="9" REF="004650_0012_100DDA7A0DCCA378">
are mere Metaphors, Words of a bare Sound, without any real &s;olid Signification? Indeed, it is to be feared, &s;ome Men would have them in|terpreted &s;o; but alas! unhappy Men! they are not to be envied their Metaphorical Interpreta|tion: It will be well. if they do not interpret them&s;elves out of their Salvation.</P>
<P>Multitudes of other Texts might be produced to confirm this &s;ame Truth; but tho&s;e already quoted are &s;o plain and convincing, that one would imagine no one &s;hould deny it; were we not told, <Q>There are &s;ome, who having Eyes, &s;ee not, and Ears hear not, and that will not under&s;tand with their Hearts, or hear with their Ears, le&s;t they &s;hould be converted, and CHRIST &s;hould heal them.</Q></P>
<P>But I proceed to a &s;econd Argument to prove, <HI>Why</HI> we mu&s;t be <HI>new Creatures,</HI> in order to be rightly in CHRIST. And that &s;hall be taken from the Purity of GOD, and the pre&s;ent cor|rupt and polluted State of Man.</P>
<P>Now GOD is de&s;cribed in Holy Scripture (and I &s;peak to tho&s;e who profe&s;s to know the Scripture) as a <HI>Spirit;</HI> as a Being of &s;uch infinite Sanctity, as to be of <HI>purer Eyes</HI> than to <HI>behold Iniquity;</HI> as to be &s;o tran&s;cendently <HI>Holy,</HI> that it is &s;aid the <HI>very Heavens are not clean in his Sight;</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Angels them&s;elves</HI> he chargeth wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h <HI>Folly.</HI> On the other Hand, <HI>Man</HI> is de&s;cribed (and every <HI>Regenerate</HI> Per&s;on will find it true by his own Experience) as a Creature altogether <HI>conceived</HI> and <HI>born in Sin;</HI> as having no <HI>good Thing</HI> dwelling in him; as being <HI>carnal, &s;old
<PB N="10" REF="004650_0013_100DDA7BAE8B5820">
under Sin;</HI> nay, as having a Mind which is <HI>Enmity with</HI> GOD, and &s;uch like. And &s;ince then there is &s;uch an infinite Di&s;parity, can any one conceive how &s;uch a filthy, corrupted, pol|luted Wretch can dwell with an infinitely pure and holy GOD, before he is changed, and ren|dered, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, like him? Can He, that is of purer Eyes than to <HI>behold</HI> Iniquity, <HI>dwell</HI> with it? Can He, in who&s;e Sight the <HI>Heavens</HI> are not clean, delight to dwell with <HI>Uncleanne&s;s</HI> it&s;elf? No; we might as well &s;up|po&s;e <HI>Light</HI> to have Communion with <HI>Darkne&s;s,</HI> or CHRIST to have Concord with <HI>Belial.</HI> But I pa&s;s on to a</P>
<P>Third Argument to make good the Apo&s;tle's A&s;&s;ertion in the Text, which &s;hall be founded on the Con&s;ideration of the Nature of that Happi|ne&s;s GOD has prepared for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that unfeign|edly love him.</P>

It is true, we may flatter our&s;elves, that, &s;up|po&s;ing we continue in our natural corrupt E&s;|tate, and carry all our Lu&s;ts along with us, we &s;hould, notwith&s;tanding, reli&s;h Heaven, was GOD to admit us therein.

<P>It is, doubtle&s;s, for this Rea&s;on, that the A|po&s;tle declares it to be the irrevocable Decree of the Almighty, that <HI>without Holine&s;s, i. e.</HI> with|out being made pure by <HI>Regeneration,</HI> and ha|ving the Image of GOD thereby rein&s;tamped upon the Soul, <HI>no Man living &s;hall &s;ee the LORD.</HI> And it is very ob&s;ervable, that our Divine Ma&s;|ter, in the famous Pa&s;&s;age before referred to, concerning the ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>Regeneration,</HI> does not &s;ay, unle&s;s a Man be born again, he SHALL NOT, but unle&s;s a Man be born again, he CANNOT enter into the Kingdom of GOD.

If it was plea&s;ed with the Communion of Saints on Earth, it will be infinitely more &s;o with the Communion and Society of holy Angels, and the Spirits of ju&s;t Men made perfect in Hea|ven. But if the Oppo&s;ite of all this be true, we may a&s;&s;ure our&s;elves, it could not be happy, was GOD him&s;elf to admit it (which he never will do) into the Regions of the Ble&s;&s;ed.

<P>If we reflect indeed on the fir&s;t and chief End of our Ble&s;&s;ed LORD's Coming, we &s;hall find it was to &s;ave us from our Sins, to be a Propiti|ation for our Sins, to give his Life a Ran&s;om for many. But then, if the Benefits of our Dear Redeemer's Death were to extend no further <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> barely to procure Forgivene&s;s of our Sins,
<PB N="13" REF="004650_0016_100DDA85C7F8FC30">
we &s;hould have as little Rea&s;on to rejoice in it, as a poor condemned Criminal that is ready to peri&s;h by &s;ome fatal Di&s;ea&s;e, would have in receiving a Pardon from his Judge. For Chri&s;tians would do well to con&s;ider, that there is not only a legal Hindrance to our Happine&s;s, as we are Breakers of GOD's Law, but al&s;o a moral Impurity in our Natures, which renders us incapable of en|joying Heaven, (as hath been already prov'd) 'till &s;ome mighty Change hath been wrought in us. It is nece&s;&s;ary therefore, in order to make <HI>Chri&s;t's</HI> Redemption complete, that we &s;hould have a Grant of GOD's Holy Spirit to change our Natures, and &s;o prepare us for the Enjoyment of that Happine&s;s our Saviour has purcha&s;ed by his precious Blood.</P>
<P>Accordingly the holy Scriptures inform us, that whom CHRIST <HI>ju&s;tifies, i. e.</HI> (as we &s;aid before) who&s;e Sins he <HI>forgives,</HI> tho&s;e he al&s;o <HI>&s;anctifies, i. e.</HI> purifies and clean&s;es, and totally changeth their corrupted Natures. Nay, in one Place of Scripture, <HI>Sanctification</HI> is put before <HI>Ju&s;tification,</HI> on purpo&s;e, as it were, to convince us that there is no Salvation to be had without it. But ye are <HI>wa&s;hed,</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, but ye are <HI>&s;anctified;</HI> and <HI>then</HI> follows, but ye are <HI>ju&s;tified.</HI> As the Scripture al&s;o &s;peaketh in another Place, CHRIST <HI>is to us Ju&s;tification, Sanctification and</HI> then <HI>Redemption.</HI> Let this therefore be admitted as another indi&s;putable Argument why we <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be new Creatures, e'er we can be <HI>in</HI> CHRIST, becau&s;e without it CHRIST is dead in vain.</P>

Proceed we now to the next general Thing propo&s;ed, <HI>viz.</HI> To draw &s;ome Inferences from what has been delivered.</P>
<P>And <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> then, if he that is in CHRIST mu&s;t be a <HI>new Creature,</HI> this may &s;erve as a Re|proof for &s;ome, who re&s;t in a bare Performance of <HI>outward</HI> Duties, without perceiving any real <HI>inward</HI> Change of Heart.</P>
<P>We may ob&s;erve a great many Per&s;ons to be very punctual in the regular Returns of publick and private Prayer, as likewi&s;e of receiving the Holy Communion, and perhaps, now and then too in keeping a Fa&s;t. And &s;o far we grant they do well. But then here is the Misfortune, they re&s;t barely in the U&s;e of the Means, and think all is over, when they have ju&s;t complied with the&s;e &s;acred In&s;titutions; Whereas, were they rightly informed, they would con&s;ider, that all the in&s;tituted <HI>Means</HI> of Grace, as Prayer, Fa&s;ting, Hearing and Reading the Word of GOD, Re|ceiving the Ble&s;&s;ed Sacrament, and &s;uch like, are no further &s;erviceable to us, than as they are found to make us <HI>inwardly</HI> better, and to carry on the &s;piritual Life in the Soul.</P>
<P>It is true, they are <HI>Means,</HI> and <HI>E&s;&s;ential</HI> ones too; but then they are <HI>only</HI> Means, they are <HI>Part,</HI> but not the <HI>Whole</HI> of Religion: For if &s;o, Who more religious than the <HI>Phari&s;ee?</HI> who fa&s;ted twice in the Week, and gave Tythes of all that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and yet was not ju&s;tified, as our Sa|viour him&s;elf informs us, in the Sight of GOD.</P>
<P>You perhaps, like the <HI>Phari&s;ee,</HI> may fa&s;t often, and make long Prayers; you may, with <HI>Herod,</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="004650_0018_100DDA8C44B41A00">
hear good Sermons gladly; or as <HI>Judas</HI> him&s;elf, in all Probability, did, receive the Ble&s;&s;ed Sacra|ment. But yet, if you continue vain and trifling, immoral or worldly-minded in your Conver&s;ati|ons, and differ from the re&s;t of your Neighbours barely in going to Church, or in complying with &s;ome outward Performances, are you better than they? No, in no wi&s;e; You are by far much wor&s;e, becau&s;e tho&s;e that wholly neglect the Means, are an&s;werable only for omitting the U&s;e of GOD's Ordinances; whereas if you u&s;e them, and at the &s;ame Time abu&s;e them, by not letting them produce their intended Effect, you thereby encourage others to think there is no|thing in them, and therefore mu&s;t expect to <HI>receive the greater Damnation.</HI></P>
<P>But, <HI>Secondly,</HI> If he that is <HI>in</HI> CHRIST mu&s;t be a <HI>new Creature,</HI> then this may check the groundle&s;s Pre&s;umption of another Cla&s;s of Profe&s;&s;ors, who re&s;t in the Attainment of &s;ome Moral Virtues, and fal&s;ely imagine they are good Chri&s;tians, if they are ju&s;t in their Dealings, are temperate in their Diet, and do Hurt or Violence to no Man.</P>
<P>But if this was all that is requi&s;ite to make us Chri&s;tians, Why might not the Heathens of old be good Chri&s;tians, who were remarkable for the&s;e Virtues? Or St. <HI>Paul,</HI> before his Con|ver&s;ion, who tells us, That then he lived in all good Con&s;cience, and was, touching the Law. blamele&s;s; and yet, after his Conver&s;ion, we find he renounces all Dependance on Works of this Nature, and only de&s;ires to be found <HI>in</HI> CHRIST,
<PB N="16" REF="004650_0019_100DDA9035C08368">
and to know the Power of his Re&s;urrection, <HI>i. e.</HI> to have an experimental Proof of receiving the HOLY GHOST, purcha&s;ed for him by the <HI>Death,</HI> and en&s;ured and applied to him by the <HI>Re&s;ur|rection</HI> of JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>The Sum of the Matter is this: Chri&s;tianity includes Morality, as Grace does Rea&s;on; but if we are only mere <HI>Morali&s;ts,</HI> if we are not <HI>inwardly</HI> wrought upon, and changed by the powerful Operations of the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> and our Moral Actions, proceed from a Principle of a <HI>new Nature,</HI> however we may call our&s;elves Chri&s;tians, it is to be feared we &s;hall be found naked at the Great Day, and in the Number of tho&s;e, who vainly depend on their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and not on the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of JESUS CHRIST, imputed to and inherent in them, as nece&s;&s;ary to their eternal Salvation.</P>
<P>Nor, <HI>Thirdly,</HI> will this Doctrine le&s;s condemn tho&s;e, who re&s;t in a partial Amendment of them&s;elves, without going on to Perfection, and experiencing a thorough, real, inward Change of Heart.</P>

<P>We may indeed depend on the broken Reed of an external Profe&s;&s;ion; we may think we have done enough, if we lead &s;uch &s;ober, hone&s;t, moral Lives, as many Heathens did. We may imagine we are in a &s;afe Condition, if we attend on the public Offices of Religion, and are con&s;tant in the Duties of our Clo&s;ets.

and are only u&s;ed as &s;o many Channels of Divine Grace; as I told you before, &s;o I tell you again, Chri&s;tianity will profit us nothing.</P>
<P>Let each of us therefore &s;eriou&s;ly put this Que&s;tion to our Hearts: Have we received the HOLY GHOST &s;ince we believed? Are we <HI>new Creatures</HI> in CHRIST, or no? At lea&s;t, if we are not &s;o <HI>yet,</HI> is it our daily Endeavour to <HI>become</HI> &s;uch? Do we make a con&s;tant and con&s;cientious U&s;e of all the Means of Grace required thereto?

In &s;hort, Do we <HI>renounce</HI> our|&s;elves, take up our Cro&s;&s;es and follow CHRIST? If &s;o, we are in that narrow Way which leads to Life: We are, at lea&s;t &s;hall in Time, become <HI>new Creatures in CHRIST.</HI> The good Seed is &s;own in our Hearts, and will, if duly water'd and nouri&s;h'd by a regular per&s;evering U&s;e of <HI>all</HI> the Means of Grace, grow up to eternal Life.

<P>But <HI>Beloved,</HI> I am per&s;uaded better Things of you, and Things that accompany Salvation, tho' we thus &s;peak; and humbly hope, that you are fully and heartily convinced, that nothing but the Wedding Garment of a <HI>new Nature,</HI> can gain Admi&s;&s;ion for you at the Marriage Fea&s;t of the Supper of the Lamb; that you are &s;incerely per&s;uaded, that he that hath not the Spirit of CHRIST is none of his; and that, unle&s;s the SPIRIT, which rai&s;ed JESUS from the Dead, dwell in you here, neither will your mortal Bodies be quickned by the &s;ame SPIRIT to dwell with him hereafter.</P>

<P>But <HI>ye are ju&s;tified,</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle; which is all the &s;ame as though he had &s;aid; You have your Sins forgiven, and are looked upon by GOD, as though you never had offended him at all: For that is the Meaning of the Word <HI>ju&s;ti|fied,</HI> in almo&s;t all the other Pa&s;&s;ages of Holy Scripture where this Word is mentioned. Thus when this &s;ame Apo&s;tle writes to the <HI>Romans,</HI> he tells them, that whom GOD calls, tho&s;e he al&s;o <HI>ju&s;tifies;</HI> that is, forgives them their Sins: And again, &s;peaking of <HI>Abraham's</HI> Faith, he tells them, that <HI>Abraham believed on</HI> HIM <HI>that ju&s;tifies the Ungodly:</HI> That is, who forgives the ungodly Man his Sins: Which Expre&s;&s;ion the Apo&s;tle him&s;elf explains by a Quotation out of the <HI>P&s;alms; Ble&s;&s;ed is the Man, &s;ays he, to whom the LORD i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">puteth no Sin.</HI> From all which Proofs, and many others that might be urged it
<PB N="26" REF="004650_0029_100DDAAA5B7DF6C0">
is evident, that being <HI>ju&s;tified,</HI> or having our Sins forgiven, are the &s;ame as to Signification: So that what the Apo&s;tle here affirms of the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Converts, namely, that they were <HI>ju&s;tified,</HI> amount to what all of us profe&s;s to hold when we ju&s;t now repeated our <HI>Creed,</HI> and each of us declared in his own Per&s;on, <HI>I believe the Forgivene&s;s of Sins.</HI> Which leads me directly to the</P>
<P>II. <HI>Second</HI> Thing propo&s;ed, namely, To en|deavour to prove that all Mankind in ge|neral, and every individual Per&s;on in par|ticular, &s;tands in need of being thus <HI>ju&s;tified,</HI> or having his Sins forgiven.</P>
<P>And indeed the Apo&s;tle &s;uppo&s;es this in the Words of the Text: <HI>But ye are ju&s;tified,</HI> &s;ays he, thereby implying, that the <HI>Corinthians</HI> (and con&s;equently all Mankind, there being no Dif|ference, as will be &s;hewn hereafter) &s;tood in need of being thus <HI>ju&s;tified.</HI></P>
<P>But, not to re&s;t in bare Suppo&s;itions, in my farther Enlargement on this Second Head, I &s;hall endeavour to prove that we all &s;tand in need of being <HI>ju&s;tified,</HI> on two Accounts: Fir&s;t, as we &s;tand chargeable with Original&mdash;Secondly, as we have been guilty of Actual Sin.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, I affirm that we all &s;tand in need of being <HI>ju&s;tified,</HI> as we are chargeable with Ori|ginal Sin: Which, though a Propo&s;ition that might be denied by a &s;elf-ju&s;tifying Infidel, who <HI>will not come to</HI> CHRIST <HI>that he may have Life,</HI> and &s;toop to tho&s;e Terms GOD has gra|ciou&s;ly &s;ettled for his Salvation; yet can never be
<PB N="27" REF="004650_0030_100DDAADCA463020">
denied by any one who believes that St. <HI>Paul's</HI> Epi&s;tles were written by Divine In&s;piration, where we are told, that <HI>in Adam all die;</HI> that is, <HI>Adam's</HI> Sin was imputed to all: And le&s;t we &s;hould forget to make a particular Application, it is farther added in another Place, that <HI>there is none that doeth good</HI> (that is, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Nature) <HI>no, not one:</HI> That we <HI>are all gone out of the Way;</HI> namely, of Original Righteou&s;ne&s;s; and are by Nature the Children of Wrath. And even <HI>David,</HI> who was the Man after GOD's own Heart, and if any one could, might &s;urely plead an Exemption from this univer&s;al Corruption, yet he confe&s;&s;es, that he was <HI>&s;hapen in Wicked|ne&s;s, and</HI> that <HI>in Sin did his Mother conceive him.</HI> And, to mention but one more Text, as immediately applicable to the pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, St. <HI>Paul,</HI> in his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Romans</HI> &s;ays, that <HI>Death came upon all Men, for the Di&s;obedience of one Man,</HI> namely, <HI>of Adam, even upon tho&s;e</HI> &s;ays he, (that is, little Children) <HI>who had not &s;inned after the Similitude of Adam's Tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ion;</HI> or, had not been guilty of actual Sin, and therefore could not be puni&s;hed with temporal, Death (which came into the World, as this &s;ame Apo&s;tle el&s;ewhere informs us, only by Sin) had not the Di&s;obedience of our fir&s;t Parents been imputed to them. So that what has been &s;aid on this Point, &s;eems to be excellently &s;ummed up in that Article of our Church, where &s;he declares, <Q>That <HI>Original Sin</HI> &s;tandeth not in the following of <HI>Adam,</HI> but it is the Fault and Corruption of the Nature of every Man, that naturally is
<PB N="28" REF="004650_0031_100DDAB160A77388">
ingendred of the Offspring of <HI>Adam;</HI> whereby Man is very far gone from Original Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, and is of his own Nature inclined to Evil, &s;o that the Fle&s;h lu&s;teth always contrary to the Spirit; and therefore in every Per&s;on born into this World it de&s;erveth GOD's Wrath and Damnation.</Q></P>
<P>I have been the more particular in treating of this Point, becau&s;e it is the very Foundation of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Religion: For I am verily per&s;ua|ded, that it is nothing but a Want of being well grounded in the Doctrine of <HI>Original Sin,</HI> and of the helple&s;s, nay, I may &s;ay damnable, Condition each of us comes into the World in, that makes &s;o many Infidels oppo&s;e, and &s;o many that call them&s;elves <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> &s;o very Luke|warm in their Love and Affections to JESUS CHRIST. It is this, and I could almo&s;t &s;ay this only, that makes Infidelity abound among&s;t us &s;o much as it does: For alas! we are mi&s;ta|ken, if we imagine that Men <HI>now</HI> commence or continue Infidels, and &s;et up corrupted Rea&s;on, in Oppo&s;ition to Revelation, merely for want of Evidence, (for I believe it might ea&s;ily be proved, that a modern Unbeliever is the mo&s;t credulous Creature living;) No, it is only for want of an humble Mind, of a Sen&s;e of their Original Depravity, and an Unwillingne&s;s to own them&s;elves &s;o depraved, that makes them &s;o ob&s;tinately &s;hut their Eyes again&s;t the Light of the Glorious Go&s;pel of CHRIST. Whereas, on the contrary, were they but once pricked to the Heart with a due and lively Sen&s;e of their
<PB N="29" REF="004650_0032_100DDAB3E369CBC0">
natural Corruption and Liablene&s;s to Condemna|tion, we &s;hould have them no more &s;coffing at Divine Revelation, and looking on it as an idle Tale; but they would cry out with convicted <HI>Paul,&mdash;LORD, what would&s;t thou have me to do?</HI> Or, with the trembling Jailor, on a like Occa&s;ion, <HI>Men and Brethren, what &s;hall we do to be &s;aved?</HI> It was an Error in this Fun|damental Point, that made &s;o many re&s;i&s;t the Evidence the Son of GOD him&s;elf gave of his Divine Mi&s;&s;ion, when he tabernacled among&s;t us. Every Word he &s;pake, every Action he did, every Miracle he wrought, proved that he came from GOD. And why then did &s;o many harden their Hearts, and would not believe his Report? Why, He him&s;elf informs us, when he tells us, <HI>They will not come to me that they may have Life:</HI> They will ob&s;tinately &s;tand out a|gain&s;t tho&s;e Means GOD had appointed for their Salvation: And St. <HI>Paul</HI> tells us, that <HI>if the Go&s;pel he hid, it is hid to them that are lo&s;t: In whom the God of this World hath blinded the Minds of them which believe not, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t the Light of the Glorious Go&s;pel of CHRIST, who is the Image of GOD, &s;hould &s;hine upon them.</HI>&mdash;2 Cor: iv. 3, 4.</P>
<P>But to return from this Digre&s;&s;ion, which I could not very well avoid making; if it be asked, How it &s;uits with the Divine Goodne&s;s, to impute the Guilt of one Man's Sin, to an in|nocent Po&s;terity? I &s;hould think it &s;ufficient, to make u&s;e of the Apo&s;tle's Words: <HI>Nay, but O Man; Who art thou that replied again&s;t GOD?
<PB N="30" REF="004650_0033_100DDAB60F4C0400">
Shall the Thing formed &s;ay to him that formed it' Why ha&s;t thou made me thus?</HI> But, to come to a more direct Reply,&mdash;Per&s;ons would do well to con&s;ider, that in this fir&s;t Covenant GOD made with Man, <HI>Adam</HI> acted as a Publick Per&s;on, as the common Repre&s;entative of all Mankind, and con&s;equently we mu&s;t &s;tand or fall with him. Had he continued in his Obedience, and not eaten the forbidden Fruit, the Benefits of that Obedience would doubtle&s;s have been imputed to us: But &s;ince he did not per&s;i&s;t in it, but broke the Covenant GOD made with him, and us in him; who dares charge the righteous Judge of all the Earth with Inju&s;tice, for imputing that to us al&s;o? But I &s;hall have an Occa&s;ion by and by, to vindicate the Divine Proceeding in this Point more particularly, and therefore I chu&s;e to wave all farther Con&s;ideration of it in this Place, and proceed to the other Thing propo&s;ed under this Second general Head, namely,</P>
<P>II. To endeavour to prove, That we all &s;tand in need of being <HI>ju&s;tified,</HI> not only as we are chargeable with <HI>Original</HI> but as we &s;tand convicted of <HI>Actual Sin.</HI></P>
<P>That GOD, as he made Man, has a Right al&s;o to demand his Obedience, I &s;uppo&s;e, is a Truth no one will deny: That He hath al&s;o given us both a natural and a written Law, whereby we are to be judged, cannot be que&s;tioned by any one who believes St. <HI>Paul's</HI> Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Romans</HI> to be of Divine Authority: For in this we are told of a Law written in the Heart, and a Law given by <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> and that each of us hath broken the&s;e
<PB N="31" REF="004650_0034_100DDAB9DAA01210">
Laws, is too evident from our own &s;ad and fre|quent Experience. Accordingly the Holy Scrip|tures inform us that <HI>there is no Man which liveth and &s;inneth not;</HI> that <HI>in many things we offend all;</HI> that <HI>if we &s;ay we have no Sin we deceive our&s;elves,</HI> and &s;uch like. And if we are thus found Of|fenders again&s;t GOD, it follows that we &s;tand in need of Forgivene&s;s for thus Offending Him; unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e GOD &s;hould enact Laws, and at the &s;ame Time not care whether they are obeyed or no; which is as ab&s;urd as to &s;uppo&s;e that a Prince &s;hould e&s;tabli&s;h Laws for the proper Go|vernment of his Country, and yet let every Vio|later of them come off with Impunity, But GOD has not dealt &s;o fooli&s;hly with his Creatures: No, as he gave us a Law, he demands our Obedience to that Law, and has obliged us univer&s;ally to obey it, under no le&s;s a Penalty than incurring his Cur&s;e and eternal Death for every Breach of it. For thus &s;peaks the Scripture: <HI>Cur&s;ed is he that continueth not in all Things that are written in this Book to do them;</HI> as the Scripture al&s;o &s;peaketh in another Place, <HI>The Soul that &s;inneth, it &s;hall die.</HI> Now it has already been proved that we have all of us &s;inned, and therefore, unle&s;s &s;ome Means can be found out to &s;atisfy GOD'S Ju&s;tice, we mu&s;t peri&s;h eternally.</P>
<P>Let us here then &s;tand a while, and &s;ee in what a deplorable Condition each of us comes into the World, and &s;till continues, till we are put into a State of Grace. For &s;urely nothing can well be &s;uppo&s;ed more deplorable than to be born under the Cur&s;e of GOD; to be charged with <HI>Original
<PB N="32" REF="004650_0035_100DDABCB9442BE8">
Guilt;</HI> and not only &s;o, but to be convicted as actual Breakers of GOD'S Law, the lea&s;t Breach of which ju&s;tly de&s;erves Eternal Damnation. Surely this can be but a melancholy Pro&s;pect to view our&s;elves in, and mu&s;t put us upon con|triving &s;ome Means whereby we may &s;atisfy and appea&s;e our offended Judge. But what mu&s;t tho&s;e Means be? Shall we Repent? Alas! there is not one Word mentioned about Repentance in the fir&s;t Covenant: <HI>The Day that thou eate&s;t thereof,</HI> &s;ays GOD, <HI>thou &s;halt &s;urely die.</HI> So that if GOD be true, unle&s;s there be &s;ome Way found out to &s;atisfy his Ju&s;tice, we mu&s;t peri&s;h, and there is no room left for us to expect a Change of Mind in GOD, though we &s;hould &s;eek it with Tears. Well then, if Repentance will not do, &s;hall we plead the Law of Works? Alas! <HI>By the Law &s;hall no Man living be ju&s;tified: For by the Law comes the Knowledge of Sin.</HI> It is that which convicts and condemns, and therefore can by no means acquit, much le&s;s ju&s;tify us. <HI>Where|with then &s;hall we come before the LORD, and bow down before the Mo&s;t High GOD;</HI> in order to procure the Forgivene&s;s of our Sins? <HI>Shall we come before him with Calves of a Year old, with Thou&s;ands of Rams, or ten Thou&s;ands of Rivers of Oil?</HI> Alas! <HI>GOD has &s;hewed thee, O Man, that this will not avail.</HI> For he hath declared, <HI>I will take no Bullock out of thy Hou&s;e, nor He-Goat out of thy Fold: For all the Bea&s;ts of the Fore&s;t are mine, and &s;o are the Cattle upon a Thou&s;and Hills. Will</HI> not <HI>the LORD then be plea&s;ed to accept our Fir&s;t-born for our

Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, the Fruit of our Bodies for the Sin of our Souls?</HI> Even this will not purcha&s;e our Pardon: For He has declared that <HI>the Children &s;hall not bear the Iniquities of their Parents.</HI> Be&s;ides, they are Sinners, and therefore, being under the &s;ame Condemnation, equally &s;tand in need of Forgivene&s;s with our&s;elves. They are impure, and will the LORD accept the Blind and Lame for Sacrifice? <HI>O wretched Men that we are! Who &s;hall deliver us from this.

<P>III. That there is no Po&s;&s;ibility of our ob|taining this <HI>Ju&s;tification,</HI> which we &s;o much want, but by the <HI>precious Blood</HI> of our Lord JESUS CHRIST: <HI>But ye are ju&s;tified in the Name of our Lord</HI> JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>But this having been in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, proved by what has been &s;aid under the foregoing Head, wherein I have &s;hewn that neither our Repen|tance, Works or Sacrifices could po&s;&s;ibly take away, or make Attonement for our Sins; no|thing remains for me to do under this Head, but to &s;hew that the Death of JESUS CHRIST has done it for us.</P>
<P>And here I &s;hall &s;till have Recour&s;e <HI>to the Law and to the Te&s;timony.</HI> For after all the mo&s;t &s;ubtle Di&s;putations on either &s;ide, nothing but the lively Oracles of GOD can give us any Satisfaction in this momentous Point: It being &s;uch an inconceivable My&s;tery, that the Eternal,

But &s;ince <HI>He has not dealt with us after our De&s;erts, nor rewarded us according to our Iniquity;</HI> &s;ince the &s;ame Revelation acquaints us, that <HI>As in Adam all die, even &s;o in</HI> CHRIST <HI>&s;hall all be made alive:</HI> Since the &s;ame GOD that informs us that <HI>Death came even upon tho&s;e who had not &s;inned after the Similitude of Adam's Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion,</HI> declares likewi&s;e, that <HI>He that believeth and is baptized &s;hall be &s;aved,</HI> or put into a State of Salvation: I &s;ay &s;ince the&s;e Things are &s;o, What Rea&s;on have &s;uch Worms as we to quarrel with the mo&s;t High GOD?

you, I fear, too long already, permit me only to make a Reflection or two on what has been &s;aid, and I have done.</P>
<P>If then we are <HI>freely ju&s;tified</HI> by the Death of JESUS CHRIST, let us here pau&s;e a while; and as before we reflected on the <HI>Mi&s;ery,</HI> let us now turn a&s;ide and admire the <HI>Happine&s;s</HI> of Man.

O who can avoid crying out, on the Con&s;ideration of this great My&s;tery of Godline&s;s,&mdash;<HI>Oh the Depth of the Riches of GOD's Love</HI> to us his wretched, mi&s;erable, undone Creatures! <HI>How un&s;earchable is his Mercy, and his Loving Kindne&s;s pa&s;t finding out!</HI> Now know we of a Truth, O GOD, that thou ha&s;t love&s;t us, <HI>&s;ince thou ha&s;t not with-held thy Son, thy only Son</HI> JESUS CHRIST, from thus dying for us.</P>
<P>But as we admire the FATHER &s;ending, let us likewi&s;e humbly and thankfully adore the SON coming, when &s;ent to die for Man. But alas! what Thoughts can conceive, what Words ex|pre&s;s the infinite Greatne&s;s of that unparalleled

<P>THE Amiablene&s;s of Religion in it&s;elf, the innumerable Advantages that flow from it to Society in general, as well as each &s;incere Profe&s;&s;or of it in particular, cannot but recom|mend it to the Choice of every con&s;iderate Per&s;on, and make even wicked Men, as they wi&s;h to die the Death, &s;o, in their more &s;ober Intervals, envy the Life of the Righteous. And indeed we mu&s;t do the World &s;o much Ju&s;tice as to confe&s;s, that the Que&s;tion about Religion does not <HI>u&s;ually</HI> ari&s;e from a Di&s;pute whether it be nece&s;&s;ary or not (for mo&s;t Men &s;ee the Nece&s;&s;ity of doing &s;omething for the Salvation of their Souls) but when is the be&s;t Time to &s;et about it: Per&s;ons are convinc'd by univer&s;al Experience, that the fir&s;t E&s;&s;ays or Endeavours towards the Attainment of Religion are attended with &s;ome Difficulty and Trouble, and therefore they would willingly defer the beginning &s;uch a &s;eemingly ungrateful Work as long as they can.

The wanton Prodigal, that is &s;pending his Sub|&s;tance in riotous Living, cries, A little more plea&s;ure, a little more Sen&s;uality, and then I'll be &s;ober in Earne&s;t. The covetous Worldling, that employs all his Care and Pains in <HI>heaping up Riches, tho' he cannot tell who &s;hall gather them,</HI> does not flatter him&s;elf that this will do always; but hopes, with the rich Fool in the Go&s;pel, to lay up Goods for a few more Years on Earth, and then he'll begin to lay up Trea&s;ures in Heaven. And, in &s;hort, thus it is that mo&s;t People are convinced of the Nece&s;&s;ity of being religious &s;ome Time or another; but then, like <HI>Felix,</HI> they put off the acting &s;uitably to their Convictions, till (what they imagine) a more convenient Sea&s;on: Whereas, would we be &s;o humble as to be guided by the Experience and Coun&s;el of the wi&s;e&s;t of Men, we &s;hould learn that Youth is the fitte&s;t Sea&s;on for Religion; <HI>Remember now thy Creator,</HI> &s;ays Solomon, <HI>in the Days of thy Youth.</HI> By which Word Remember, we are not to under&s;tand a bare &s;peculative Re|membrance, or calling to Mind, (for that, like a dead Faith, will profit us nothing) but &s;uch a Remembrance as will con&s;train us to Obedience, and oblige us out of Gratitude to perform all that the LORD our GOD &s;hall require of us. For as forgetting GOD, in Scripture Language, implies a total Neglect of our Duty, in like Manner remembring him &s;ignifies a perfect Performance of it: So that, when <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Remember thy Creator in the Days of thy Youth,</HI> it is the &s;ame as if he had &s;aid, keep GOD's

</LIST>
<P>And <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> then, I am to make good the Wi&s;e Man's Propo&s;ition implied in the Words of the Text, and to &s;hew that Youth is the fitte&s;t Sea&s;on for Religion: <HI>Remember now thy Creator in the Days of thy Youth.</HI>&mdash;But in Order to proceed more clearly in this Argument, it may not be improper, fir&s;t, to explain what I mean by the Word <HI>Religion.</HI> By this Term, then, I would not be under&s;tood to mean a bare outward Profe&s;&s;ion or naming the Name of CHRIST; for we are told, that many that have even prophe&s;ied in his Name, and in his Name ca&s;t out Devils, &s;hall notwith&s;tanding be rejected by him at the la&s;t Day: Nor would I under&s;tand by it barely being admitted into CHRIST'S Church by Bapti&s;m; for then <HI>Simon Magus, Arius,</HI> and the Here&s;iarchs of old might pa&s;s for religious Per&s;ons, for the&s;e
<PB N="43" REF="004650_0046_100DDADC32059290">
were baptized; nor yet the receiving the other Seal of the Covenant, for then <HI>Judas</HI> him&s;elf might be canoniz'd for a Saint; nor indeed do I mean any or all of the&s;e together, con&s;ider'd by them&s;elves; but a thorough, real, inward Change of Nature, wrought in us by the powerful Operations of the Holy Gho&s;t, convey'd to and nouri&s;h'd in our Hearts, by a con&s;tant U&s;e of all the Means of Grace, evidenc'd by a good Life, and bringing forth the Fruits of the Spirit.</P>
<P>The attaining this real, inward Religion, is a Work of &s;o great Difficulty, that <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> a learned Doctor and Teacher in <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> thought it altogether impo&s;&s;ible, and therefore ignorantly asked our Ble&s;&s;ed LORD, <HI>how this Thing could be?</HI> And <HI>truly</HI> to rectify a di&s;order'd Nature, to mortify our corrupt Pa&s;&s;ions, to turn Darkne&s;s to Light, to put off the old Man, and put on the new, and thereby to have the Image of GOD rein&s;tamp'd upon the Soul, or in one Word, to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e born again,</HI> however light &s;ome may make of it, mu&s;t, after all our Endeavours, be own'd by Man impo&s;&s;ible. 'Tis true, in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ed, CHRIST'S Yoke is &s;aid to be an ea&s;y or a gracious Yoke, and his Burthen light; but then it is to tho&s;e only who have been accu&s;tomed to bear and draw in it. For as the wi&s;e Son of <HI>Sirach</HI> ob&s;erves, <HI>At fir&s;t Wi&s;dom walketh with her Children in crooked Ways, and brings them into Fear; and torments them with her Di&s;cipline, and does not turn to comfort and rejoyce them, till &s;he has try'd them and proved their Judgment.</HI>&mdash;No; we mu&s;t not flatter our&s;elves, that our depraved Natures can
<PB N="44" REF="004650_0047_100DDADDB603FCD8">
be renewed, unle&s;s we &s;ubmit to a great many Difficulties. The &s;piritual Birth is attended with its Pangs, as well as the natural: For they that have experienc'd it (and they only are the proper Judges) can acquaint you, that frequent Acts of Self-denial mu&s;t be exerci&s;ed, a con&s;tant regular Di&s;cipline kept up, left, after all, when we come to the Birth, we &s;hould want Strength to bring forth.</P>
<P>But if <HI>the&s;e Things are &s;o;</HI> if there are Diffi|culties and Pangs attending our being born again, and Di&s;cipline mu&s;t be called in, what Sea&s;on more proper than that of Youth; when, if ever, our Bodies are robu&s;t and vigorous, and our Minds active and courageous, and con&s;equently we are then the be&s;t qualified to endure Hardne&s;s as good Soldiers of JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>We find in &s;ecular Matters People commonly ob&s;erve this Method, and &s;end their Children abroad among the Toils and Fatigues of Bu&s;ine&s;s, in their younger Years, as well knowing they are then fitte&s;t to undergo them. And why do they not act with the &s;ame Con&s;i&s;tency in the grand Affair of Religion? Becau&s;e, as our Saviour has told us, <HI>the Children of this World are wi&s;er in their Generation, than the Children of Light.</HI></P>
<P>But, <HI>Secondly,</HI> if pure Religion and undefiled con&s;i&s;ts in the total Renewal of our corrupted Natures, then 'tis not only a Work of Difficulty, but of Time: For, as the old was not, &s;o neither is the new Creation compleated in a Day. No, good Men know, by certain Experience, that it is a long while e'er <HI>old Things</HI> can <HI>pa&s;s away,</HI>
<PB N="45" REF="004650_0048_100DDAE08DCC1EA8">
and <HI>all Things become new</HI> in them. The &s;trong Man arm'd has gotten too great Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Hearts to be quickly driven out, and they are obliged to combat many a weary Hour, e'er their Corruptions, which is the Armour in which the &s;trong Man tru&s;ted, be wholly taken from him. Nay, they find their whole Lives &s;hort enough to perfect the Work of Regeneration, which they were &s;ent into the World to do, and never expect to &s;ay 'tis fini&s;h'd, till, with their ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter, they bow down their Heads, and give up the Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>And, if this be the Ca&s;e, if the Renovation of our Nature be not only difficult, but requires &s;o long a Space to compleat it in; then, it highly concerns every one to &s;et about it betimes, and to <HI>work their Work while it is Day, before the Night cometh, when no Man can work.</HI></P>
<P>Could we, indeed, live to the Age of <HI>Methu&s;a|lah,</HI> and had but little Bu&s;ine&s;s to employ our&s;elves in, we might then be more excu&s;able, if we made no other U&s;e of this World, than, what too many do, <HI>take our Pa&s;time therein;</HI> but &s;ince our Lives are &s;o very &s;hort, and the working out our Salvation requires &s;o much Time, we have no Room left for trifling, le&s;t we &s;hould be &s;natched away while our Lamps are untrimmed, and we are entirely unprepared to meet the Bridegroom.</P>
<P>Did we know a Friend or Neighbour, who had a long Journey of the utmo&s;t Importance to make, and yet &s;hould &s;tand <HI>all the Day idle,</HI> neglecting to &s;et out till the Sun was about to go down, we could not but pity and condemn his
<PB N="46" REF="004650_0049_100DDAE217358740">
egregious Folly: And yet it is to be feared mo&s;t Men are ju&s;t &s;uch Fools; they have a long Journey to take, nay, a Journey to Eternity, a Journey of infinite Importance, and which they are obliged to di&s;patch before the Sun of their natural Life be gone down; and yet they loiter away their Time allotted them to perform their Journey in, till Sickne&s;s or Death &s;urprizes them; and then they cry out, <HI>What &s;hall we do to inherit eternal Life?</HI> But, alas! is this a proper Sea&s;on to ask &s;uch a Que&s;tion? Is this a Time to <HI>begin</HI> their Journey, when they &s;hould be at the <HI>End</HI> of it; or to enquire what they mu&s;t do, when per|haps they have hardly any Strength or Ability left to do any Thing to the Purpo&s;e, and when they &s;hould be waiting with humble Patience, in hopes of &s;peedily receiving their Wages for Work already done? <HI>O fooli&s;h People and unwi&s;e! If you offer the Blind for Sacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye offer the Lame and Sick, is it not evil? Offer it now unto thy Governor, will he be plea&s;ed with thee, or accept thy Per&s;on? &s;aith the LORD of Ho&s;ts.</HI> But leaving &s;uch to the Mercies of GOD, I pa&s;s on to</P>
<P>The Second general Thing propo&s;ed, <HI>viz.</HI> To &s;hew the Advantages that will ari&s;e from <HI>Remembring our Creator in the Days of our Youth;</HI> which may &s;erve as &s;o many Motives to excite and quicken all Per&s;ons immediately to &s;et about it.</P>
<P>And the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Benefit re&s;ulting from thence is, that it will bring mo&s;t Honour and Glory to GOD. This, I &s;uppo&s;e, every &s;erious Per&s;on
<PB N="47" REF="004650_0050_100DDAE4C35B8710">
will grant, ought to be the Point in which all our Actions &s;hould centre; for to this End were we born; to this End were we redeemed by the precious Blood of JESUS CHRIST, that we &s;hould promote GOD'S Eternal Glory. And as the Glory of GOD is mo&s;t advanced by paying Obedience to his Precepts, they that begin &s;oone&s;t to walk in his Ways, act mo&s;t to his Glory: For the common Objection again&s;t the divine Laws in general, and the Doctrines of the Go&s;pel in particular, is, that they are not practicable, that they are contrary to Fle&s;h and Blood, and that all tho&s;e Precepts concerning Self-Denial, Renunciation of and Deadne&s;s to the World, are but &s;o many arbitrary Re&s;traints impo&s;ed upon human Nature. But when we &s;ee mere Striplings not only practi&s;ing, but delighting in &s;uch religious Duties, and in the Days of their Youth, when, if ever, they have a Reli&s;h for &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ures, &s;ubduing and de&s;pi&s;ing the <HI>Lu&s;t of the Fle&s;h, the Lu&s;t of the Eye, and the Pride of Life.</HI>&mdash;This, this is acceptable with GOD; this vindicates his injur'd Honour; this &s;hews that his Service is perfect Freedom, <HI>that his Yoke is ea&s;y, and his Burden light.</HI></P>
<P>But, <HI>Secondly,</HI> as an early Piety redounds mo&s;t to the Honour of GOD, &s;o it will bring mo&s;t Honour to our&s;elves: For tho&s;e that honour GOD, GOD will honour. We find it therefore re|mark'd to the Prai&s;e of <HI>Obadiah,</HI> that he &s;erved the LORD from his Youth: Of <HI>Samuel,</HI> that he &s;tood, when young, before GOD in a linnen Ephod: Of <HI>Timothy,</HI> that from a Child he had
<PB N="48" REF="004650_0051_100DDAE90FF4CB08">
known the Holy Scriptures: Of St. <HI>John,</HI> that he was the younge&s;t and mo&s;t beloved Di&s;ciple; and of our Ble&s;&s;ed LORD him&s;elf, that at Twelve Years old he went up to the Temple, and &s;at among the Doctors, both hearing and asking them Que&s;tions.</P>
<P>Nor, <HI>Thirdly,</HI> will an early Piety afford us le&s;s Comfort than Honour, not only becau&s;e it renders Religion habitual to us, but al&s;o becau&s;e it gives us a well-grounded A&s;&s;urance of the Sincerity of our Profe&s;&s;ions. Was there no other Argument again&s;t a Death-bed Repentance but the Un&s;atisfactorine&s;s and Anxiety of &s;uch a State, that would be &s;ufficient to deter all thinking Per&s;ons from deferring the mo&s;t important Bu&s;ine&s;s of their Life to &s;uch a dreadful Period of it. For &s;uppo&s;ing a Man be &s;incere in his Profe&s;&s;ions of Repentance on a Death-bed (which is very much to be doubted) yet he can take no great Comfort in them, becau&s;e he is uncertain whether his Convictions and Remor&s;e proceed from a true Sorrow for Sin, or a &s;ervile Fear of Puni&s;hment. But a young Saint need fear no &s;uch Perplexity; he knows that he loves GOD for his own Sake, and is not driven to him by a Dread of impending Evil: He does not decline the Gratifications of Sen&s;e, becau&s;e he can no longer <HI>bear the Voice of Singing-Men and Singing-Women;</HI> but willingly takes up his Cro&s;s, and follows his ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter in his Youth; and therefore mu&s;t have great Confidence of his Sincerity towards GOD. But farther, as an early Piety &s;hews the Heart of its Sincerity, &s;o likewi&s;e it brings its pre&s;ent
<PB N="49" REF="004650_0052_100DDAEA950155A8">
Reward with it, as it renders Religion, and all its Duties, habitual and ea&s;y. A young Saint, was you to a&s;k him, would joyfully tell you the un|&s;peakable Comfort of beginning to be good be|times: As for his Part, he knows not what Men mean by talking of Mortification, Self-Denial, and Retirement, as hard and rigorous Duties; for he has &s;o accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to them, that they are now become even natural, and he takes infinitely more Plea&s;ure in practi&s;ing the &s;evere&s;t Precepts of the Go&s;pel, than a luxurious <HI>Dives</HI> in a Bed of State, or an ambitious <HI>Haman</HI> at a Royal Banquet. And, oh! how happy mu&s;t that Youth be, who&s;e Duty is become a &s;econd Nature, and to whom tho&s;e Things, which &s;eem terrible to others, are grown both ea&s;y and delightful!</P>
<P>But the greate&s;t Advantage of an early Piety is &s;till behind, <HI>viz.</HI> That it lays in the be&s;t Provi&s;ion of Comfort and Support again&s;t &s;uch Times as we &s;hall &s;tand mo&s;t in Need thereof, <HI>viz.</HI> all Times of our Tribulation, and in particular again&s;t the Time of old Age, the Hour of Death and the Day of Judgment.</P>
<P>This is the Argument the Wi&s;e Man make<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> U&s;e of in the Words immediately following the Text: <HI>Remember now,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>thy Creator in the Days of thy Youth, while the evil Days come not, nor the Years draw nigh, wherein thou &s;halt &s;ay, I have no Plea&s;ure in them.</HI> Ob&s;erve the Time of old Age is an evil Time, Years wherein there is no Plea&s;ure; and ask tho&s;e that are grown old, and they will inform you &s;o. Cordials &s;urely then mo&s;t be exceeding proper to &s;upport our
<PB N="50" REF="004650_0053_100DDAEE85071430">
drooping Spirits: And, oh! What Cordial comparable to the grateful Review of a well-&s;pent Life? When the Eyes, like <HI>I&s;aac'</HI>s, are grown dim with Age; when <HI>the Keepers of the Hou&s;e,</HI> i. e. the Hands, &s;hall tremble; as the Wi&s;e Man goes on to de&s;cribe the Infirmities of old Age; when <HI>the &s;trong Men bow them&s;elves,</HI> i. e. when the Legs grow feeble; and <HI>the Grinders,</HI> i. e. the Teeth, &s;hall cea&s;e to do their proper Office, becau&s;e they are few; for a Per&s;on then to hear the Pre|cepts of the Go&s;pel read over to him, and to be able to lay his Hand on his Heart, and to &s;ay &s;in|cerely, <HI>All the&s;e have I kept from my Youth:</HI> This mu&s;t fill him with &s;uch un&s;peakable Comfort, that I want Words to expre&s;s, &amp; Thoughts to conceive it. But, &s;uppo&s;ing it was po&s;&s;ible for us to e&s;cape the Inconveniencies of old Age, yet &s;till Death is a Debt we all mu&s;t pay; and what is wor&s;e, it generally comes attended with &s;uch dreadful Circum&s;tances, that it will make even a <HI>Felix</HI> tremble. But as for the Godly, that have &s;erved the LORD from their Youth, it is not &s;o with them; no, they look upon Death not as a <HI>King of Terrors,</HI> but as a welcome Me&s;&s;enger, that is come to conduct them to their wi&s;h'd-for Home. All the Days of their appointed Time have they waited, and it has been the Bu&s;ine&s;s of their whole Lives to prepare them&s;elves for the coming of their great Change; and therefore they rejoyce to hear, that they are called to meet the heavenly Bridegroom. Thus die the early (I mean the early, if per&s;evering) pious; who&s;e <HI>Path has been as the &s;hining Light that &s;hineth mere and more,

And this he did with &s;uch Demon&s;tration of the Spirit, and of Power, that <HI>Fe&s;tus,</HI> unwilling to be convinced by the &s;tronge&s;t Evidence, cries out with a loud Voice, <HI>Paul, much Learning doth make thee mad.</HI> To which the brave Apo&s;tle (like a true Follower of the Holy JESUS) meekly replies, <HI>I am not mad, mo&s;t noble</HI> Fe&s;tus, <HI>but &s;peak forth the Words of Truth and Soberne&s;s.</HI> But in all Probability &s;eeing King <HI>Agrippa</HI> more affected with his Di&s;cour&s;e, and ob&s;erving in him an Inclination to know the Truth, he applies him&s;elf more particularly to him: <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> King,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>knoweth of the&s;e Things; before whom al&s;o I &s;peak freely; for I am per&s;uaded that none of the&s;e Things are hidden from him.</HI> And then, that if po&s;&s;ible he might compleat his wi&s;hed-for Conver&s;ion, he with an inimitable Strain of Oratory, addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf &s;till more clo&s;ely,&mdash;<HI>King</HI> Agrippa, <HI>believe&s;t thou the Pro|phets?

<P>Which Words, taken with the Context, afford us a lively Repre&s;entation of the different Reception the Doctrine of CHRIST'S Mini&s;ters, who come in the Power and Spirit of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> meets with now-a-days in the Minds of Men.

And therefore, from the Words of the Text, &s;hall endeavour to con&s;ider the&s;e three Things:

<ITEM><HI>Thirdly,</HI> I &s;hall con&s;ider the Ineffectualne&s;s, Danger, Ab&s;urdity, and Unea&s;ine&s;s that attends tho&s;e that are but <HI>Almo&s;t Chri&s;tians.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Fourthly,</HI> I &s;hall conclude with a general Exhor|tation, to &s;et all upon &s;triving not only to be <HI>Almo&s;t,.</HI> but <HI>Altogether Chri&s;tians.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I. And <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> I am to con&s;ider, what is meant by an <HI>Almo&s;t Chri&s;tian.</HI></P>
<P>An <HI>Almo&s;t Chri&s;tian</HI> then, if we con&s;ider him in re&s;pect to his Duty to GOD, is one that halts between two Opinions, that wavers between CHRIST and the World; that would reconcile GOD <HI>and Mammon,</HI> that is, Light and Dark|ne&s;s, CHRIST and <HI>Belial.</HI> It is true, He has an Inclination to Religion, but then he is very cautious how he goes too far in it: His fal&s;e Heart is always crying out, Spare thy&s;elf, d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> thy&s;elf no Harm. He prays indeed, that GOD'<HI>s Will may be done on Earth, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it is in Heaven:</HI> But then, notwith&s;tanding he is very partial in his Obedience, and fondly hopes that GOD will not <HI>be extreme to mark every Thing that he</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">|fully <HI>does ami&s;s;</HI> though an in&s;pired Apo&s;tle has told him, that he that wilfully <HI>offends in one Point, is guilty of all.</HI> Above all, he is one that depends much on outward Ordinances, and upon that account looks upon him&s;elf as <HI>Righteous, and de&s;pi&s;es others;</HI> though at the &s;ame Time he may be as great a Stranger to the Divine Life as any other Per&s;on what&s;oever. In &s;hort, he
<PB N="61" REF="004650_0064_100DDB0D098C36C0">
is fond of the <HI>Form,</HI> but never experiences the <HI>Power of Godline&s;s</HI> in his Heart: He goes on Year after Year, feeding and attending on the Means of Grace; but then, like <HI>Pharaoh'</HI>s Lean Kine, is never the better, but rather the wor&s;e for them.</P>
<P>If you con&s;ider him in re&s;pect to his Neigh|bour, he is one that is &s;trictly ju&s;t to all; but then this does not proceed from any Love to GOD or Regard to Man, but only out of a Principle of Self-Love; becau&s;e he knows Di&s;hone&s;ty will &s;poil his Reputation, and con&s;equently hinder his Thriving in the World.</P>
<P>He is one that depends much on being Nega|tively good, and contents him&s;elf with the Con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having done no one any Harm; though he reads in the Go&s;pel, that <HI>the unprofi|table Servant was ca&s;t into outer Darkne&s;s,</HI> and the barren Fig-tree cur&s;ed and <HI>dried up</HI> from the Roots, not for bearing <HI>bad,</HI> but <HI>no</HI> Fruit.</P>
<P>He is no Enemy to charitable Contributions, if not too frequently recommended: But then he is quite unacquainted with the kind Offices of <HI>Vi&s;iting the Sick and Impri&s;oned, Cloathing the Naked, and Relieving the Hungry.</HI> He thinks that the&s;e Things belong only to the Clergy, though his own fal&s;e Heart tells him, that no|thing but Pride keeps him from exerci&s;ing the&s;e Acts of Humility, and that JESUS CHRIST, in the 25th Chapter of St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> condemns Per&s;ons to everla&s;ting Puni&s;hment, not for being Fornicators, Drunkards, or Extor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">oners, but merely for neglecting the&s;e charitable Offices,
<PB N="62" REF="004650_0065_100DDB0EC02984E8">
<HI>When the Son of Man;</HI> &s;ays our ble&s;&s;ed LORD him&s;elf, <HI>&s;hall come in his Glory, He &s;hall &s;et the Sheep on his Right Hand, and the Goats on his Left. And then &s;hall He &s;ay unto them on his Left Hand, Depart from me, ye cur&s;ed, into everla&s;ting Fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels: For I was an Hungred, and ye gave me no Meat; I was thir&s;ty, and ye gave me no Drink; I was a Stranger, and ye took me not in; Naked, and ye cloathed me not; Sick and in Pri&s;on, and ye vi&s;ited me not.

<P>But to proceed in our Character of an <HI>Almo&s;t Chri&s;tian:</HI> If we con&s;ider him in re&s;pect of him|&s;elf: as before we &s;aid he was &s;trictly hone&s;t to his Neighbour, &s;o he is likewi&s;e &s;trictly &s;ober in him&s;elf: But then both his Hone&s;ty and Sobriety proceed from the &s;ame Principle of a fal&s;e Self-Love. It is true, he <HI>runs not into the &s;ame Exce&s;s of Riot</HI> with other Men; but
<PB N="63" REF="004650_0066_100DDB1334FC25E0">
then it is not out of Obedience to the Laws of GOD, but either becau&s;e his Con&s;titution will not away with Intemperance; or rather becau&s;e be is cautious of forfeiting his Reputation, or unfitting him&s;elf for temporal Bu&s;ine&s;s. But though he is &s;o prudent as to avoid Intemperance and Exce&s;s, for the Rea&s;ons before mentioned; yet he always goes to the Extremity of what is lawful. It is true, he is no Drunkard; but then he has no <HI>Chri&s;tian Self-Denial</HI> to plead for him. He cannot think our Saviour to be &s;o au&s;tere a Ma&s;ter, as to deny us to indulge our|&s;elves in &s;ome Particulars: And &s;o by this Means he is kept out of a Sen&s;e of true Religion, as much as if he lived in Debauchery, or any other Crime whatever. As to &s;ettling his Principles as well as Practice, he is guided more by the World, than by the Word of GOD. As for his Part, he cannot think the Way to Heaven &s;o narrow as &s;ome would make it: And therefore con&s;iders not &s;o much what Scripture requires, as what &s;uch and &s;uch a good Man does, or what will be&s;t &s;uit his own corrupt Inclinations.

<P>II. But it is Time for me to proceed to the <HI>Second general Thing</HI> propo&s;ed; namely, to con&s;ider the Rea&s;ons why &s;o many are no more than <HI>Almo&s;t Chri&s;tians.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. And the fir&s;t Rea&s;on I &s;hall mention is, becau&s;e &s;o many &s;et out with fal&s;e Notions of Religion; and though they live in a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Country, yet know not what <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> is. This perhaps may be e&s;teemed a hard Saying, but Experience &s;adly evinces the Truth of it; For &s;ome place Religion in being of this or that Communion; more in Morality; mo&s;t in a Round of Duties, and a Model of Performances; and few, very few acknowledge it to be, what it really is, a thorough inward Change of Nature, a Divine Life, a Vital Participation of JESUS CHRIST, an Union of the Soul with GOD; which the Apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;es by &s;aying, <HI>He that is joined to the LORD is one Spirit.</HI> Hence it happens that &s;o many, even of the mo&s;t knowing
<PB N="65" REF="004650_0068_100DDB18B48B3F88">
Profe&s;&s;ors, when you come to conver&s;e with them concerning the E&s;&s;ence, the Life, the Soul of Religion, I mean our <HI>New Birth</HI> in JESUS CHRIST, confe&s;s them&s;elves quite ignorant of the Matter, and cry out with <HI>Nicodemus, How can this Thing be?</HI> And no wonder then, that &s;o many are only <HI>Almo&s;t Chri&s;tians,</HI> when &s;o many know not what <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> is: No Marvel &s;o many take up with the <HI>Form,</HI> when they are quite Strangers to the <HI>Power of Godline&s;s;</HI> or content them&s;elves with the Shadow, when they know &s;o little about the Sub&s;tance of it. And this is one Cau&s;e why &s;o many are <HI>almo&s;t,</HI> why &s;o few are <HI>altogether Chri&s;tians.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. A Second Rea&s;on that may be a&s;&s;igned why &s;o many are no more than <HI>almo&s;t Chri&s;tians,</HI> is a &s;ervile Fear of Man: Multitudes there are and have been, who, though awakened to a Sen&s;e of the Divine Life, and <HI>have ta&s;ted and felt the Powers of the World to come;</HI> yet out of a ba&s;e &s;inful Fear of being counted &s;ingular, or con|temned by Men, have &s;uffered all tho&s;e good Impre&s;&s;ions to wear off again. It is true they have &s;ome E&s;teem for JESUS CHRIST; but then, like <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> they would <HI>come to him</HI> only <HI>by Night:</HI> They are willing to &s;erve him; but then they would do it <HI>&s;ecretly, for Fear of the Jews:</HI> They <HI>have a Mind to &s;ee JESUS,</HI> but then <HI>they cannot come to him, becau&s;e of the Pre&s;s,</HI> for fear of being laughed at, and ridi|culed by tho&s;e with whom they u&s;ed to &s;it at Meat. But well did our Saviour prophe&s;y of &s;uch Per&s;ons, <HI>How can ye love me which receive
<PB N="66" REF="004650_0069_100DDB1B552E1E80">
Honour one of another?</HI> Alas! have they never read, that <HI>the Friend&s;hip of this World is Enmity with GOD;</HI> and that our LORD him&s;elf has threatned, <HI>Who&s;oever &s;hall be a&s;hamed of me or of my Words, in this wicked and adulterous Generation, of him &s;hall the Son of Man be a&s;ha|med, when he cometh in the Glory of his Father and of his Holy Angels?</HI> But no Wonder that &s;o many are no more than <HI>almo&s;t Chri&s;tians</HI> &s;ince &s;o many <HI>love the Prai&s;e of Men more than the Honour which cometh of GOD.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. A third Rea&s;on why &s;o many are no more than <HI>Almo&s;t Chri&s;tians,</HI> is a reigning Love of Money. This was the pitiable Ca&s;e of that forward young Man in the Go&s;pel, who came running to our Ble&s;&s;ed LORD, and kneeling be|fore him, enquired what <HI>He mu&s;t do to inherit Eternal Life;</HI> to which our ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter replied, <HI>Thou knowe&s;t the Commandments, Do not Kill, Do not commit Adultery, Do not Steal:</HI> To which the young Man replied (Oh that every young Man here pre&s;ent could do &s;o too) <HI>All the&s;e I have kept from my Youth.</HI> But when our LORD proceeded to tell him, <HI>Yet lacke&s;t thou one Thing, Go &s;ell all that thou ha&s;t and give to the Poor,&mdash;he was grieved at that Saying, and went away &s;orrowful, for he had great Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions!</HI> Poor Youth! he had a good Mind to be a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> and to inherit Eternal Life, but thought it too dear, if it could be purcha&s;ed at no le&s;s an Expence than of his whole E&s;tate! And thus many, both Young and Old, now-a-days come running to wor&s;hip our ble&s;&s;ed LORD in publick,
<PB N="67" REF="004650_0070_100DDB1D07C12350">
and kneel before him in private, and enquire at his Go&s;pel, what they mu&s;t do to inherit Eternal Life: But when they find they mu&s;t renounce the Self-Enjoyment of Riches, and for&s;ake <HI>all</HI> in Affection <HI>to follow Him,</HI> they cry, <HI>The LORD pardon us in this Thing!&mdash;We pray Thee, have us excu&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P>But is Heaven &s;o &s;mall a Trifle in &s;uch Men's E&s;teem, as not to be worth a little gilded Earth? Is Eternal Life &s;o mean a Purcha&s;e, as not to de&s;erve the Temporary Renunciation of a few tran&s;itory Riches? Surely it is. But however incon&s;i&s;tent &s;uch a Behaviour may be, this inor|dinate Love of Money is too evidently the common and fatal Cau&s;e why &s;o many are no more than <HI>Almo&s;t Chri&s;tians.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Nor is the reigning Love of Plea&s;ure a le&s;s uncommon, or a le&s;s fatal Cau&s;e why &s;o many are no more than <HI>almo&s;t Chri&s;tians.</HI> Thou|&s;ands and ten Thou&s;ands there are, who de&s;pi&s;e Riches, and would willingly be true Di&s;ciples of JESUS CHRIST, would parting with their Money make them &s;o; but when they are told that our Ble&s;&s;ed LORD has laid it down as an indi&s;|pen&s;able Condition, that <HI>Who&s;oever will come after Him mu&s;t deny him&s;elf;</HI>&mdash;like the pitiable young Man before mentioned, <HI>they go away &s;or|rowful:</HI> For they have too great a Love for &s;en|&s;ual Plea&s;ures. They will, like <HI>Herod,</HI> perhaps &s;end for the Mini&s;ters of CHRIST, as he did for <HI>John,</HI> and <HI>hear them gladly:</HI> But touch them in their <HI>Herodias,</HI> tell them they mu&s;t part with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> or &s;uch a darling Plea&s;ure; and with wicked
<PB N="68" REF="004650_0071_100DDB2113483010">
<HI>Ahab</HI> they cry out, <HI>Ha&s;t thou found us, O our Enemy?</HI> Tell them of the Nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>Morti|fication, Fa&s;ting</HI> and <HI>Self-Denial,</HI> and it is as difficult to them to hear, as if you was to bid them <HI>cut off a Right Hand or pluck out a Right Eye:</HI> They cannot think our Ble&s;&s;ed LORD requires &s;o much at their Hands, though an in&s;pired Apo&s;tle has commanded us to <HI>mortify our Members which are upon the Earth:</HI> And he him&s;elf, even after he had converted Millions, and was very near arrived to the End of his Race, yet profe&s;&s;ed that it was his daily Practice to <HI>keep under his Body, and bring it into Subjection, le&s;t after he had preached to others, he him&s;elf &s;hould be a Ca&s;t-away!</HI></P>
<P>But &s;ome Men would be wi&s;er than this great Apo&s;tle, and chalk out to us what they fal&s;ely imagine an ea&s;ier Way to Happine&s;s. They would flatter us we may go to Heaven without offering Violence to our &s;en&s;ual Appetites; and <HI>enter into the &s;trait Gate</HI> without <HI>&s;triving</HI> again&s;t our carnal Inclinations. And this is another Rea&s;on why &s;o many are only <HI>almo&s;t,</HI> and not <HI>altogether Chri&s;tians.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. The fifth and la&s;t Rea&s;on I &s;hall a&s;&s;ign why &s;o many are only <HI>almo&s;t Chri&s;tians,</HI> is a Fickle&s;s and In&s;tability of Temper.</P>
<P>It has been, no doubt, the Misfortune that many a Mini&s;ter and &s;incere <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> has met with, to weep and wail over Numbers of promi|&s;ing Converts, who <HI>&s;eemingly</HI> began in the Spi|rit, but after a while have fell away, and <HI>ba&s;ely</HI> ended in the Fle&s;h; and this not for want of
<PB N="69" REF="004650_0072_100DDB2331EE12F0">
right Notions in Religion, nor out of a &s;ervile Fear of Man, nor out of Love of <HI>Money</HI> or &s;en|&s;ual Plea&s;ure, but out of an In&s;tability and Fickle|ne&s;s of Temper. They looked upon Religion merely for Novelty, as &s;omething which plea&s;es them for a while; but after their Curio&s;ity was &s;atisfied, they have laid it a&s;ide again: Like the young Man that came to &s;ee JESUS with a Linnen Cloth about his naked Body, they have followed him for a Sea&s;on, but when Temptations have come to take hold on them, for want of a little more Re&s;olution, they have been &s;tripped of all their good Intentions, and fled <HI>away naked.</HI> They at fir&s;t, <HI>like a Tree planted by the Water-&s;ide,</HI> grew up and flouri&s;hed for a while; but <HI>having no Root of them&s;elves,</HI> no inward Principle of Holine&s;s and Piety, like <HI>Jonah'</HI>s Gourd, were &s;oon <HI>dried up, cut down and withered.</HI> Their good Intentions are but too like the violent Motions of the Animal Spirits of a Body newly beheaded, which tho' impetuous, are not la&s;ting. In &s;hort, they &s;et out well in their Journey to Heaven, but finding the Way either narrower or longer than they expected,&mdash;through an Un|&s;teadine&s;s of Temper, they have made an eternal Halt, and &s;o <HI>returned like the Dog to his Vomit, or like the Sow that was wa&s;hed to her wallowing in the Mire!</HI></P>
<P>But I tremble to pronounce the Fate of &s;uch un&s;table Profe&s;&s;ors, <HI>who having put their Hands to the Plow,</HI> for want of a little more Re&s;olution, &s;hamefully <HI>look back.</HI> How &s;hall I repeat to them that dreadful Threatning, <HI>If any Man
<PB N="70" REF="004650_0073_100DDB26C46B4960">
draw back, my Soul &s;hall have no Plea&s;ure in him:</HI> And again, <HI>It is impo&s;&s;ible,</HI> that is, exceed|ing difficult at lea&s;t, <HI>for tho&s;e that have been once enlightened, and have ta&s;ted the good Gift of GOD's</HI> Holy Spirit, <HI>and the Powers of the World to come, if they &s;hould fall away, to be renewed again unto Repentance.</HI> But notwith&s;tanding the Go&s;pel is &s;o &s;evere again&s;t Apo&s;tates, yet many that begun well, through a Ficklene&s;s of Tem|per, (Oh that none of us here pre&s;ent may ever be &s;uch) have been by this means of <HI>the Num|ber of tho&s;e that turn back unto Perdition.</HI> And this is the fifth and la&s;t Rea&s;on I &s;hall give, why &s;o many are only <HI>almo&s;t,</HI> and not <HI>altogether Chri&s;tians.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>you, Brethren, have not &s;o</HI> learned CHRIST. GOD forbid that a Fear of a little Contempt, a love of a little worldly Gain, or a Fondne&s;s for a little &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ure, or want of &s;teady Re&s;olution, &s;hould hinder you from entring into Eternal Life, or make you &s;o &s;otti&s;h as to think you may compound Matters between GOD and your Souls.</P>
<P>III. Proceed we therefore now to the <HI>Third General Thing</HI> propo&s;ed, namely, to con|&s;ider the Folly of being no more than an <HI>almo&s;t Chri&s;tian.</HI></P>
<P>And the fir&s;t Proof I &s;hall give of the Folly of &s;uch a Proceeding is,&mdash;that it is ineffectual to Salvation. It is true, &s;uch Men are almo&s;t good, but <HI>almo&s;t</HI> to hit the Mark, is <HI>really</HI> to mi&s;s it. GOD requires us to <HI>love him with all our Hearts, with all our Souls, and with all our Strength&punc;</HI>
<PB N="71" REF="004650_0074_100DDB297B696D48">
He loves us too well to admit any Rival; be|cau&s;e &s;o far as our Hearts are empty of GOD, &s;o far mu&s;t they be unhappy. The Devil, indeed, like the fal&s;e Mother that came before <HI>Solomon,</HI> would have our Hearts divided, as &s;he would have had the Child; but GOD, like the true Mother, will have all or none. <HI>My Son give me thy Heart,</HI> thy whole Heart, is the general Call to all: And if we do not perform this Condition, we never can expect the Divine Mercy.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons may indeed flatter them&s;elves, that a partial Obedience will &s;erve their Turn; but GOD at the Great Day will &s;trike them dead, as he did <HI>Ananias</HI> and <HI>Sapphira</HI> by the Mouth of his Servant <HI>Peter,</HI> for pretending to offer him all their Hearts, when they <HI>keep back</HI> from him the greate&s;t <HI>Part.</HI> They may perhaps impo&s;e upon their fellow Creatures for a while, but He that enabled <HI>Elijah</HI> to cry out, <HI>Come in thou Wife of Jeroboam,</HI> when &s;he came di&s;gui&s;ed to enquire about her &s;ick Son, will al&s;o di&s;cover them thro' their mo&s;t artful Di&s;&s;imulations, and if <HI>their Hearts are not whole with him&mdash;appoint them their Portion with Hypocrites and Unbelievers.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> What renders an half-way Piety more inexcu&s;able is, that it is not only in&s;uffi|cient to our own Salvation, but al&s;o mo&s;t preju|dicial to that of others.</P>
<P>An <HI>Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">o&s;t Chri&s;tian</HI> is one of the mo&s;t hurtful Creatures in the World: He is a <HI>Wolf in Sheep's Cloathing;</HI> he is one of tho&s;e fal&s;e Prophets our Ble&s;&s;ed LORD bids us beware of in his Sermon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the Mount, who would per&s;uade Men, that
<PB N="72" REF="004650_0075_100DDB2C1EEE9058">
the Way to Heaven is broader than it really is; and thereby, as it was ob&s;erved before, <HI>enter not into the Kingdom of GOD them&s;elves, and tho&s;e that are entring in they hinder.</HI> The&s;e, the&s;e are the Men that turn the World into a lukewarm <HI>Laodicean</HI> Spirit; that hang out fal&s;e Lights, and &s;o &s;hipwreck unthinking benighted Souls in their Voyage to the Haven where they would be. The&s;e are they that are greater Enemies to the Cro&s;s of CHRIST, than Infidels them&s;elves: For of an Unbeliever every one will be aware; but an <HI>Almo&s;t Chri&s;tian,</HI> through his &s;ubtle Hypocri&s;y, <HI>draws away many after him;</HI> and therefore mu&s;t expect to <HI>receive the greater Damnation.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>thirdly,</HI> as it is mo&s;t prejudicial to our|&s;elves and hurtful to others, &s;o it is the greate&s;t Piece of Ingratitude we can expre&s;s towards our Lord and Ma&s;ter JESUS CHRIST. For did he come down from Heaven, and &s;hed his precious Blood, to purcha&s;e the&s;e Hearts of ours, and &s;hall we only give him half of them? Oh how can we &s;ay we love him, when our Hearts are not wholly with him? How can we call him our Saviour, when we will not endeavour &s;incerely to approve our&s;elves to him&punc; and &s;o let him &s;ee the Travail of his Soul, and be &s;atisfied!</P>
<P>Had any of us purcha&s;ed a Slave at a mo&s;t expen&s;ive Rate, that was before involved in the utmo&s;t Mi&s;eries and Torments, and &s;o mu&s;t have continued for ever, had we &s;hut up our Bowels of Compa&s;&s;ion from him; and was this Slave afterwards to grow rebellious, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="73" REF="004650_0076_100DDB2E022BE498">
giving us but half his Service: How, how &s;hould we exclaim again&s;t his ba&s;e Ingratitude! And yet this ba&s;e ungrateful Slave thou art, O Man, who acknowledge&s;t thy&s;elf to be redeemed from infinite unavoidable Mi&s;ery and Puni&s;hment by the Death of JESUS CHRIST, and yet wilt not give thy&s;elf wholly to him. But &s;hall we deal with GOD our Maker in a manner we would not be dealt with by a Man like our&s;elves? &s;hall we mete out a le&s;s Mea&s;ure of Love to our Saviour, than we would have dealt to our&s;elves? GOD forbid!</P>
<P>IV. No, (that I may come to the <HI>la&s;t Thing</HI> propo&s;ed, namely, to add a Word or two of Exhortation to be not only <HI>almo&s;t,</HI> but <HI>altogether Chri&s;tians)</HI> let us &s;corn all &s;uch ba&s;e and treache|rous Treatment of our King and Saviour, nay our GOD. Let us not take &s;ome Pains all our Lives to go to Heaven, and yet plunge our&s;elves into Hell at la&s;t. Let us give GOD our whole Hearts, and no longer <HI>halt between two Opinions: If the World be GOD let us &s;erve</HI> That; <HI>If Plea&s;ure be a GOD let us &s;erve</HI> That; but <HI>if the LORD He be GOD,</HI> let us, Oh <HI>let us &s;erve Him alone.</HI> Alas! why, why &s;hould we &s;tand out any longer? Why &s;hould we be &s;o in Love with Slavery, as not wholly to renounce the World, the Fle&s;h, and the Devil, which, like &s;o many &s;piritual Chains, bind down our Souls, and hinder them from flying up to GOD. Alas! what are we afraid of? Is not GOD able to reward our entire Obedience? If he is, as the <HI>almo&s;t Chri&s;tian'</HI>s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Way of &s;erving him &s;eems to grant,&mdash;Why
<PB N="74" REF="004650_0077_100DDB3216B487D0">
then will we not &s;erve him entirely? For the &s;ame Rea&s;on we do &s;o much, why do we not do more? Or do you think that being only half Religious will make you happy, but that going farther will render you mi&s;erable and unea&s;y? Alas! this, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> is Delu&s;ion all over: For what is it but this <HI>half Piety,</HI> this wavering between GOD and the World, that makes &s;o many that are &s;eem|ingly well di&s;po&s;ed, &s;uch utter Strangers to the Comforts of Religion? They chu&s;e ju&s;t &s;o much of Religion as will di&s;turb them in their Lu&s;ts, and follow their Lu&s;ts &s;o far as to deprive them|&s;elves of the Comforts of Religion. Whereas on the Contrary, would they &s;incerely <HI>leave all</HI> in Affection, and <HI>give their Hearts</HI> wholly <HI>to GOD,</HI> they would then (and they cannot till then) expe|rience the un&s;peakable Plea&s;ure of having a Mind at unity with it&s;elf, and enjoy &s;uch a <HI>Peace of God,</HI> which even in this Life, <HI>pa&s;&s;es all Under&s;tanding,</HI> and which they were entire Strangers to before. It is true, if we will devote our&s;elves entirely to GOD, we mu&s;t meet with Contempt; but then it is becau&s;e Contempt is nece&s;&s;ary to heal our Pride. We mu&s;t renounce &s;ome &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ure; but then it is becau&s;e tho&s;e unfit us for Spiritual ones, which are infinitely better. We mu&s;t renounce the Love of the World; but then it is that we may be filled with the Love of GOD: And when that has once enlarged our Hearts, we &s;hall like <HI>Jacob</HI> when he &s;erved for his beloved <HI>Rachel,</HI> think nothing too difficult to undergo, no Hard|&s;hips too tedious to endure, becau&s;e of the Love we &s;hall then have for our dear Redeemer. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="75" REF="004650_0078_100DDB34C2F26500">
ea&s;y, thus delightful will be the Ways of GOD even in this Life: But when once we throw off the&s;e Bodies, and our Souls are <HI>filled with all the Fullne&s;s of GOD,</HI> Oh! what Heart can conceive, what Tongue can expre&s;s, with what un&s;peakable Joy and Con&s;olation we &s;hall then look back on our pa&s;t &s;incere and hearty Services, which have procured us &s;o invaluable a Reward!

<P>Let me therefore, to conclude, exhort you, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> to have always the un&s;peakable Reward of an entire Obedience &s;et before you: And think withal, that every degree of Holine&s;s you neglect, every In&s;tance of Piety you pa&s;s by, is a Jewel taken out of your Crown, a degree of Ble&s;&s;ed|ne&s;s lo&s;t in the Vi&s;ion of GOD. Oh! do but always think and act thus, and you will no longer be labouring to compound Matters between GOD and the World; but on the contrary, be daily endeavouring to give up your&s;elves more and more unto him; you will be always Watching, always praying, always a&s;piring after farther degrees of Purity and Love, and &s;o con&s;equently always preparing your&s;elves for a fuller Light and Enjoyment of that GOD, in who&s;e Pre&s;ence there is Fulne&s;s of Joy, and at who&s;e Right Hand there are Plea&s;ures for ever more. <HI>Amen!

<P>From which Words I &s;hall con&s;ider the&s;e three Things:
<LIST>
<ITEM>I, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The Nature of the <HI>Self-Denial</HI> recommended in the Text; and in how many Re&s;pects we mu&s;t deny our&s;elves, in order to come after JESUS CHRIST.</ITEM>

<ITEM>III. <HI>Thirdly</HI> and <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> I &s;hall offer &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">me Con&s;iderations, which may &s;erve as &s;o ma|ny Motives to reconcile us to, and quicken us in the Practice of this Doctrine of <HI>Self-Denial.</HI></ITEM>

<P>I. And <HI>fir&s;t</HI> then, I am to &s;hew the Nature of the <HI>Self-Denial</HI> recommended in the Text; or in how many Re&s;pects we mu&s;t deny our&s;elves in order to follow JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>Now as the Faculties of the Soul are di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the Under&s;tanding, Will and Affecti|ons; &s;o in all the&s;e mu&s;t each of us <HI>deny him&s;elf.</HI> We mu&s;t not <HI>lean to our own Under<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="5 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> being <HI>wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e in our own Eyes, and prudent in our own Sight;</HI> but we mu&s;t &s;ubmit our &s;hort &s;ighted

Rea&s;on to the Light of of Divine Revelation: For there are My&s;teries in Religion, which are above, though not contrary to, our natural Rea&s;on: And therefore we &s;hall never become <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> unle&s;s we ca&s;t down Imaginations, <HI>and every high Thing that exalteth it&s;elf again&s;t the Knowledge of GOD, and bring into Capti|vity every Thought to the Obedience of</HI> CHRIST. It is in this Re&s;pect, as well as others, that we mu&s;t <HI>become Fools for</HI> CHRIST'<HI>s Sake,</HI> and ac|knowledge we know nothing without Revelation as we ought to know. We mu&s;t then, with all Humility and Reverence, embrace the my&s;te|rious Truths revealed to us in the <HI>Holy Scrip|tures;</HI> for thus only can we become truly Wi&s;e, even <HI>Wi&s;e unto Salvation.</HI> It was Matter of our Ble&s;&s;ed LORD's Thank&s;giving to his Heavenly Father, that he had <HI>hid the&s;e Things from the Wi&s;e and Prudent, and had revealed them unto Babes.</HI> And in this Re&s;pect al&s;o we mu&s;t <HI>be converted and become as little Children,</HI> teach|able, and willing to follow the Lamb into what &s;oever My&s;teries he &s;hall be plea&s;ed to lead us; and believe and practi&s;e all Divine Truths, not becau&s;e we can demon&s;trate them, but becau&s;e GOD, <HI>who can not lye,</HI> has revealed them to us.</P>
<P>Hence then we may trace Infidelity to its Fountain Head: For it is nothing el&s;e but a Pride of the Under&s;tanding, an Unwillingne&s;s to &s;ubmit to the <HI>Truth</HI> of GOD, that makes &s;o many, profe&s;&s;ing them&s;elve wi&s;e, to become &s;uch Fools as to <HI>deny the LORD, who</HI> has &s;o dearly

<P>But farther; as we mu&s;t renounce our own Wills in <HI>doing,</HI> &s;o likewi&s;e mu&s;t we renounce them in <HI>&s;uffering</HI> the Will of GOD. What&s;oever befals us, we mu&s;t &s;ay with good old <HI>Eli, It is the LORD, let Him do what &s;eemeth him good;</HI> or with one that was infinitely greater than <HI>Eli, Father, not my Will, but thine be done.</HI>&mdash;O JESU, thine was an innocent Will, and yet tho renounced&s;t it: Teach us, even us al&s;o, O our Saviour! to &s;ubmit our Wills to thine, in all <HI>the Evils</HI> which &s;hall be <HI>brought upon us;</HI> and <HI>in every Thing</HI> enable us to <HI>give Thanks,</HI> &s;ince it <HI>is thy</HI> ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Will concerning us!</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly and la&s;tly, we mu&s;t <HI>deny</HI> our&s;elves, as in our Under&s;tandings and Wills, &s;o likewi&s;e in our Affections. More particularly we mu&s;t <HI>deny</HI> our&s;elves the plea&s;urable Indulgence and Self-Enjoyment of Riches: <HI>If any Man will come after me,</HI> &s;ays our ble&s;&s;ed LORD, <HI>he mu&s;t for&s;ake all and follow me.</HI> And again (to &s;hew the utter Incon&s;i&s;tency of the Love of the Things of this World with the Love of the Father) he tells us, that <HI>unle&s;s a Man for&s;ake all that he hath, he cannot be my Di&s;ciple.</HI></P>

Far be it from me to think that the&s;e Texts are to be taken in a literal Sen&s;e, as though they obliged rich Per&s;ons to go &s;ell all that they have and give to the Poor, (for that would put it out of their Power to be &s;erviceable to the Poor for the future) but however they certainly imply thus much, That we are to &s;it loo&s;e to, &s;ell and for&s;ake all in Affection, and be willing to part with every Thing, when GOD &s;hall require it at our Hands: That is, as the Apo&s;tle ob&s;erves, we mu&s;t <HI>u&s;e the World as though we u&s;ed it not;</HI> and tho' we are <HI>in the World,</HI> we mu&s;t not be <HI>of it.</HI> We mu&s;t look upon our&s;elves as Stewards and not Proprietors of the manifold Gifts of GOD; provide fir&s;t what is nece&s;&s;ary for our&s;elves and for our Hou&s;holds, and expend the re&s;t, not in Indulgences and &s;uperfluous Ornaments, forbidden by the Apo&s;tle, but in cloathing, feed|ing, and relieving the naked, hungry, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Di&s;ciples of JESUS CHRIST. This is what our Ble&s;&s;ed LORD would have us under&s;tand by <HI>for&s;aking all,</HI> and in this Sen&s;e mu&s;t each of us <HI>deny him&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible that this will &s;eem <HI>an hard Saying</HI> to many, who will be offended becau&s;e they are covetous, and <HI>Lovers of Plea&s;ure more than Lovers of God:</HI> But <HI>if I yet plea&s;ed</HI> &s;uch <HI>Men, I &s;hould not be the Servant of</HI> CHRIST.

But to proceed: As we mu&s;t renounce our Affection for Riches, &s;o likewi&s;e our Affections for our Relations when they &s;tand in Oppo&s;ition to our Love of, and Duty to GOD: For thus &s;aith the Saviour of the World: <HI>If any Man will come after me, and hateth not his Father and Mother, his Children, and Brethren, and Si&s;ters, yea and his own Life al&s;o, he cannot be a Di&s;ciple.</HI>&mdash;Strange Doctrine this! What, hate our own Fle&s;h! What hate the Father that begat us, the Mother that bare us! <HI>How can the&s;e Things be?</HI> Can GOD contradict him&s;elf? Has he not bid us honour our Father and Mother? And yet we are here commanded to hate them. How mu&s;t the&s;e Truths be reconciled? Why, by interpreting the Word <HI>hate,</HI> not in a rigorous and ab&s;olute Sen&s;e, but <HI>comparatively:</HI> Not as implying a total Alienation, but a le&s;s degree of Affection. For thus our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour him&s;elf (the be&s;t and &s;ure&s;t Expo&s;itor of his own Meaning) explains it in a parallel Text, <HI>Matth.</HI> x. 37. <HI>He that loveth Father or Mother more than me, is not worthy of me: He that loveth Son or Daughter more than me is not worthy of me.</HI> So that when the Per&s;ua&s;ions of &s;uch our Friends (as for our Trial they may be permitted to be) are contrary to the Will of GOD, we mu&s;t &s;ay with <HI>Levi, we have not known them;</HI> or, agreeably to our ble&s;&s;ed LORD'S Rebuke to <HI>Peter, Get you behind me,</HI> my Adver|&s;aries; <HI>for you &s;av<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ur not the Things that be of GOD, but the Things that be of Man.</HI></P>
<P>To conclude this Head: We mu&s;t <HI>deny our&s;elves</HI> in Things indifferent: For it might ea&s;ily be &s;hewn

that as many, if not more, peri&s;h by an immode|rate U&s;e of Things in them&s;elves indifferent as by any gro&s;s Sin whatever. A prudent <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> therefore will con&s;ider not only what is <HI>lawful</HI> but what is <HI>expedient</HI> al&s;o: Not &s;o much what degrees of <HI>Self-denial</HI> be&s;t &s;uit his Inclinations here, as what will mo&s;t <HI>effectually</HI> break his Will, and fit him for greater degrees of <HI>Glory</HI> hereafter.</P>
<P>But is this the Doctrine of <HI>Chri&s;tianity?</HI> and is not the Chri&s;tian World then a&s;leep?

<P>When our Ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter had been di&s;cour&s;ing publickly concerning the Watchfulne&s;s of the <HI>faithful and wi&s;e Steward,</HI> his Di&s;ciples a&s;ked him, <HI>Speake&s;t thou this Parable to all, or only to us?</HI> The &s;ame Que&s;tion I am aware has been, and will be put concerning the foregoing Doctrine: For too many, unwilling to take CHRIST'S ea&s;y Yoke upon them, in order to evade the Force of the Go&s;pel Precepts, would pretend that all tho&s;e Commands concerning <HI>Self-Denial,</HI> renouncing our&s;elves and the World, belonged only to our LORD's fir&s;t and immediate Followers, and not <HI>to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s or to our Children.</HI> But &s;uch Per&s;ons <HI>greatly err, not knowing the Scriptures,</HI> nor <HI>the Power of Godline&s;s in their Hearts.</HI> For the Doctrine of JESUS CHRIST, like his ble&s;&s;ed Self, is <HI>the &s;ame Ye&s;terday, To Day, and for ever.</HI> What he &s;aid unto <HI>one,</HI> he &s;aid unto <HI>all,</HI> even unto the Ends of the World; <HI>If any Man will come after me, let him deny him&s;elf:</HI> And in the Text it is particular|ly mentioned that <HI>He &s;aid unto them all.</HI> And le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t we &s;hould &s;till ab&s;urdly imagine that this Word <HI>all</HI> was to be confined to his Apo&s;tles, with whom he was then di&s;cour&s;ing, it is &s;aid in ano|ther Place, that JESUS turned unto the Multitude and &s;aid, <HI>If any Man will come after me, and hateth not his Father and Mother, yea and his own Life al&s;o, he cannot be my Di&s;ciple.</HI> <Q>When our ble&s;&s;ed LORD had &s;poken a certain Parable, it is

<P>In the former part of this Di&s;cour&s;e I ob&s;erved that the Precepts concerning <HI>for&s;aking</HI> and <HI>&s;elling all</HI> did not oblige us in a literal Sen&s;e, becau&s;e the State of the Church does not demand it of us, as it did of the Primitive <HI>Chri&s;tians;</HI> but &s;till the &s;ame Deadne&s;s to the World, the &s;ame ab&s;temious U&s;e of, and Readine&s;s to part with our Goods for CHRIST'S &s;ake, is as ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for, and as obligatory on us, as it was on them. For though the Church may differ as to the outward State of it, in different Ages, yet as to the Purity of its inward State, it was, is, and always will be invariably the &s;ame.

<P N="1">1. And the fir&s;t Means I &s;hall recommend to you, in order to reconcile you to this Doctrine is, to meditate frequently on the Life of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord and Ma&s;ter JESUS CHRIST.

No, far be it from any &s;incere <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> to judge after this Manner: For St. <HI>Peter</HI> tells us, <HI>He &s;uffered for us, leaving us an Example that we &s;hould follow his Steps.</HI> Had CHRIST, indeed, like <HI>tho&s;e that &s;at in</HI> Mo&s;es'<HI>s Chair, laid heavy Burthens of Self-Denial</HI> upon us, (&s;uppo&s;ing they were heavy, which they are not) and refu&s;ed to <HI>touch them him&s;elf with one of his Fingers;</HI> we might have had &s;ome Pretence to complain: But &s;ince he has enjoined us nothing but what he has fir&s;t

<HI>Fir&s;t</HI> then, I am to prove the Truth of the Wi&s;e Man's A&s;&s;ertion, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>Two are better than One,</HI> and that in Reference to <HI>Society</HI> in general, and <HI>Religious Societies</HI> in particular.</P>
<P>And how can this be done better than by &s;hewing that it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the Welfare both of the Bodies and Souls of Men? Indeed, if we look upon Man as he came out of the Hands of his Maker, we imagine him to be <HI>perfect, entire, lacking nothing.</HI> But GOD, who&s;e <HI>Thoughts are not as our Thoughts,</HI> &s;aw &s;omething &s;till wanting to make <HI>Adam</HI> happy. And what was that? Why, an Help meet for him. For thus &s;peaketh the Scripture: <HI>And the LORD GOD &s;aid, It is not good that the Man &s;hould be alone, I will make an Help meet for him.</HI></P>
<P>Ob&s;erve, GOD &s;aid, <HI>It is not good,</HI> thereby implying that the Creation would have been imperfect, <HI>in &s;ome &s;ort,</HI> unle&s;s an <HI>Help</HI> was found out <HI>meet for Adam.</HI> And if this was the Ca&s;e of Man before the Fall; if an <HI>Help</HI> was <HI>meet</HI> for him in a State of Perfection, &s;urely &s;ince the Fall, when we come naked and helple&s;s out of our Mother's Womb, when our Wants increa&s;e with our Years, and we can &s;carcely &s;ub&s;i&s;t a Day without the mutual A&s;&s;i&s;tance of each other, well may we &s;ay, <HI>It is not good for Man to be alone.</HI></P>
<P>Society then, we &s;ee, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in re&s;pect to our <HI>bodily</HI> and <HI>per&s;onal</HI> Wants. If we carry our View farther, and con&s;ider Man|kind as divided into different Cities, Countries,

and Nations, the Nece&s;&s;ity of it will appear yet more evident. For how can Communities be kept up, or Commerce carried on, without <HI>Society?</HI> Certainly not at all, &s;ince Providence &s;eems wi&s;ely to have a&s;&s;igned a particular Pro|duct to almo&s;t each particular Country, on Pur|po&s;e, as it were, to oblige us to be &s;ocial; and hath &s;o admirably mingled the Parts of the whole Body of Mankind together, <HI>that the Eye cannot &s;ay to the Hand, I have no Need of Thee; nor again, the Hand to the Foot, I have no Need of Thee.</HI></P>
<P>Many other In&s;tances might be given of the <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of <HI>Society,</HI> in Reference to our <HI>bodily, per&s;onal,</HI> and <HI>national</HI> Wants. But what are all the&s;e when <HI>weighed in the Ballance of the Sanctuary,</HI> in Compari&s;on of the infinite greater Need of it, with re&s;pect to the <HI>Soul?</HI> It was chiefly in regard to this better Part, no doubt, that GOD &s;aid, <HI>It is not good for the Man to be alone.</HI> For, let us &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Adam</HI> to be as happy as may be, placed as the Lord of the Creation in the <HI>Paradi&s;e of</HI> GOD, and &s;pending all his Hours in adoring and prai&s;ing the ble&s;&s;ed Author of his Being; yet as his Soul was the very Copy of the <HI>Divine Nature,</HI> who&s;e peculiar Property it is to be communicative, <HI>without the Divine All-Sufficiency,</HI> he could not be compleatly happy, becau&s;e he was alone and incommunicative, nor even Content in <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI> for want of a <HI>Partner</HI> in his Joys. GOD knew this, and therefore &s;aid, <HI>It is not good that the Man &s;hould be alone, I will make a Help meet for him.</HI> And though this
<PB N="98" REF="004650_0102_100DD791E241BEB0">
proved a fatal Means of his falling; yet that was not owing to any natural Con&s;equence of <HI>Society;</HI> but partly to that cur&s;ed Apo&s;tate, who <HI>craftily lies in wait to deceive;</HI> partly to <HI>Adam's</HI> own Folly, in rather chu&s;ing to be mi&s;erable with one he loved, than tru&s;t in GOD to rai&s;e him up another Spou&s;e.</P>
<P>If we reflect indeed on that familiar Inter|cour&s;e our fir&s;t Parents could carry on with Heaven, in a State of Innocence, we &s;hall be apt to think he had as little Need of <HI>Society,</HI> as to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Soul,</HI> as before we &s;uppo&s;ed him to have, in re&s;pect to his <HI>Body.</HI> But yet, as GOD and the Holy Angels were &s;o far above him on the one Hand, and the Bea&s;ts &s;o far beneath him on the other, there was nothing like having one to conver&s;e with, who was <HI>Bone of his Bone, and Fle&s;h of his Fle&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>Man, then, could not be fully happy, we &s;ee even in <HI>Paradi&s;e,</HI> without a Companion of his own Species, much le&s;s now he is driven out. For, let us view him a little in his natural E&s;tate now, &s;ince the Fall, as <HI>having his Under&s;tanding darkened, his Mind alienated from the Life of GOD;</HI> as no more able to &s;ee his Way wherein he &s;hould go, than a Blind Man to de&s;cribe the Sun: That notwith&s;tanding this, he mu&s;t re|ceive his Sight e'er he can &s;ee GOD: And that if he never &s;ees him, he never can be happy. Let us view him, I &s;ay, in this Light (or rather this Darkne&s;s) and deny the <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of <HI>Society</HI> if we can. A Divine Revelation we find is ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary, we being by Nature as unable
<PB N="99" REF="004650_0103_100DDB7288C4A8D0">
to know, as we are to do our Duty. And how &s;hall we learn except one teach us? But was GOD to do this him&s;elf, how &s;hould we, with <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> exceedingly quake and fear? Nor would the Mini&s;try of Angels in this Affair be without too much Terror. It is nece&s;&s;ary, therefore (at lea&s;t GOD's Dealing with us hath &s;hewed it to be &s;o) that we &s;hould be <HI>drawn with the Cords of a Man.</HI> And that a Divine Revelation being granted, we &s;hould u&s;e one another's A&s;&s;i&s;tance, under GOD to in&s;truct each other in the Know|ledge, and to exhort one another to the Practice of tho&s;e Things which belong to our everla&s;ting Peace. This is undoubtedly the great End of Society intended by GOD &s;ince the Fall, and a &s;trong Argument it is, why <HI>Two are better than One,</HI> and why we &s;hould <HI>not for&s;ake the a&s;&s;embling our&s;elves together.</HI></P>
<P>But farther, let us con&s;ider our&s;elves as <HI>Chri|&s;tians,</HI> as having this natural Veil, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, taken off from our Eyes by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of GOD's Holy Spirit, and &s;o enabled to &s;ee what he requires of us. Let us &s;uppo&s;e our&s;elves in &s;ome degree to have <HI>ta&s;ted the good Word of Life,</HI> and to have felt the Powers of the World to come, influencing and moulding our Souls into a religious Frame: To be fully and heartily con|vinced that we are <HI>Soldiers</HI> lilted under the <HI>Banner of</HI> CHRIST, and have proclaimed open War at our <HI>Bapti&s;m, again&s;t the World, the Fle&s;h, and the Devil;</HI> and have, perhaps, frequently renewed our Obligations &s;o to do, by partaking of the <HI>Lord's Supper:</HI> That we are &s;urrounded with

Millions of Foes without, and infe&s;ted with a Legion of Enemies within: That we are com|manded to &s;hine as Lights in the World, in the mid&s;t of a crooked and perver&s;e Generation: That we are travelling to a long Eternity, and need all imaginable Helps to &s;hew us, and encou|rage us in our Way thither. Let us, I &s;ay, reflect on all this, and then how &s;hall each of us cry out, Brethren, what a nece&s;&s;ary Thing it is to meet together in <HI>Religious Societies?</HI></P>
<P>The Primitive <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> were fully &s;en&s;ible of this, and therefore we find them continually keeping up Communion with each other: For what &s;ays the Scripture? <HI>They continued &s;tedfa&s;tly in the Doctrine and Fellow&s;hip,</HI> Acts ii. 42. <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> were no &s;ooner di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by the Great Council, than they ha&s;te away to their Companions. <HI>And being &s;et at Liberty,</HI> &s;ays the Text, <HI>they came to their own, and told them all the&s;e Things which the High Prie&s;t had &s;aid unto them,</HI> Acts iv. 23. <HI>Paul,</HI> as &s;oon as converted, <HI>tarried three Days with the Di&s;ciples that were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> Dama&s;cus, Acts ix. 19. And <HI>Peter</HI> after|wards, when relea&s;ed from Pri&s;on, immediately goes to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Mary,</HI> where there were <HI>great Multitudes a&s;&s;embled, praying,</HI> Acts xii. 12. And it is reported of <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> in After-Ages, that they u&s;ed to a&s;&s;emble together before Day|light, to &s;ing a P&s;alm to CHRIST as GOD. So precious was the <HI>Communion of Saints</HI> in tho&s;e Days.</P>
<P>If it be asked, what Advantage we &s;hall reap from &s;uch a Procedure now? I an&s;wer, much

every Way. <HI>Two are better than One, becau&s;e they have a good Reward for their Labour: For if they fall, the One will lift up his Fellow; but woe be to him that is alone when he falleth, for he hath not another to help him up.

<P>Which directly leads me to my Second general Head, under which I was to a&s;&s;ign &s;ome Rea&s;ons why <HI>Two are better than One,</HI> e&s;pecially in <HI>Religious Society.</HI></P>

Privilege that (to u&s;e the Words of an <HI>eminent Chri&s;tian</HI>) we &s;hall never know the Value of, till we come to Glory.</P>
<P>But this is not all; for &s;uppo&s;ing that we could always &s;tand upright, yet who&s;oever reflects on the Difficulties of Religion in general, and his own Propen&s;ity to Lukewarmne&s;s and Indiffe|rence in particular, will find that he mu&s;t be <HI>zealous</HI> as well as <HI>&s;teady,</HI> if ever he expects to enter the Kingdom of Heaven.

Again,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>If Two lie together, then they have Heat; but how can One be warm alone?</HI></P>
<P>Which was the next Thing to be con&s;idered under the Second general Head, <HI>viz.</HI> to a&s;&s;ign a &s;econd Rea&s;on why <HI>Two are better than One,</HI> becau&s;e they can impart <HI>Heat</HI> to each other.</P>
<P>It is an Ob&s;ervation no le&s;s true than common, That kindled Coals, if placed a&s;under, &s;oon go out, but if heaped together, quicken and enliven each other, and afford a la&s;ting Heat. The &s;ame will hold good in the Ca&s;e now before us. If <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> kindled by the Grace of GOD unite, they will quicken and enliven each other; but if they &s;eparate and keep a&s;under, no marvel if they &s;oon grow cool or tepid.

Company, where it may be had. Behold here, then, another excellent Benefit flowing from <HI>Religious Society;</HI> it will keep us <HI>zealous,</HI> as well as <HI>&s;teady,</HI> in the Ways of Godline&s;s.</P>
<P>But to illu&s;trate this a little farther by a Compari&s;on or two.

<P>La&s;tly, Let us con&s;ider our&s;elves in another View before mentioned, <HI>viz.</HI> as Per&s;ons travel|ling to a long <HI>Eternity;</HI> as re&s;cued by the <HI>free Grace of GOD,</HI> in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, from our natural <HI>Egyptian Bondage,</HI> and marching under the Conduct of our <HI>&s;piritual Jo&s;hua,</HI> through the <HI>Wilderne&s;s of this World,</HI> to the Land of our <HI>Heavenly Canaan.</HI> Let us farther reflect how apt we are to &s;tartle at every Difficulty; to cry; <HI>There are Lions!

<P>Hitherto we have con&s;idered the Advantages of <HI>Religious Societies,</HI> as a great Pre&s;ervative again&s;t falling (at lea&s;t dangerou&s;ly falling) into Sin and Lukewarmne&s;s, and that too from our own Corruptions.

Nor will the <HI>Devil</HI> be wanting in his <HI>artful</HI> In&s;inuations, or <HI>impious</HI> Sugge&s;tions, to divert or terrify thee from pre&s;&s;ing forwards, <HI>that thou may&s;t lay hold on the Crown of Life:</HI> And if he cannot prevail this Way, he will try another; and, in order to make his Temptation the more undi&s;cerned, but withal more &s;ucce&s;sful, he will employ, perhaps, &s;ome of thy neare&s;t Relatives, or mo&s;t powerful Friends (as he &s;et <HI>Peter</HI> on our <HI>ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter</HI>) who will always be bidding thee <HI>&s;pare thy&s;elf;</HI> telling thee thou neede&s;t not take &s;o much Pains; that it is not &s;o difficult a Matter to get to Heaven as &s;ome People would make of it, nor the Way &s;o narrow as others imagine it to be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>

And that therefore, the only Rea|&s;on why the&s;e Friends give thee &s;uch Advice, is, becau&s;e they are not willing to take &s;o much Pains them&s;elves; or, as our Saviour told <HI>Peter</HI> on a like Occa&s;ion, becau&s;e they <HI>&s;avour not the Things that be of GOD, but the Things that be of Men.</HI></P>
<P>This then, is another excellent Ble&s;&s;ing ari&s;ing from <HI>Religious Society,</HI> that Friends can hereby &s;ecure each other from tho&s;e that oppo&s;e them. The <HI>Devil</HI> is fully &s;en&s;ible of this, and therefore he has always done his utmo&s;t to &s;uppre&s;s, and put a Stop to the <HI>Communion of Saints.</HI> This was his grand Artifice at the fir&s;t planting of the <HI>Go&s;pel;</HI> to per&s;ecute the Profe&s;&s;ors of it, in order to &s;eparate them.

<P>But, on the contrary, knowing his own In|tere&s;t is &s;trengthened by <HI>Society,</HI> he would fir&s;t per&s;uade us to neglect the <HI>Communion of Saints,</HI> and then bid us <HI>&s;tand in the Way of Sinners,</HI> hoping thereby to put us into <HI>the Seat of the

Scornful. Judas</HI> and <HI>Peter</HI> are melancholly In&s;tances of this. The former had no &s;ooner left his Company at Supper, but he went out and betrayed his Ma&s;ter: And the di&s;mal Downfal of the latter, when he would venture him&s;elf among&s;t a Company of Enemies, plainly &s;hews us what the Devil will endeavour to do, when he gets us by our&s;elves.

<P>And now, after &s;o many Advantages to be reaped from <HI>Religious Society,</HI> may we not very ju&s;tly cry out with the Wi&s;e Man in my Text, <HI>Woe be to him that is alone; for when he falleth, he hath not another to lift him up:</HI> When he is <HI>cold,</HI> he hath not a Friend to <HI>warm</HI> him; when he is <HI>a&s;&s;aulted,</HI> he hath not a <HI>Second</HI> to help him to with&s;tand his Enemy.</P>
<P>III. I now come to my <HI>Third general Head,</HI> under which was to be &s;hewn the &s;everal Duties incumbent on every Member of a <HI>Religious Society,</HI> as &s;uch, which are three. 1. <HI>Mutual Reproof:</HI> 2. <HI>Mutual Exhorta|tion:</HI> 3. <HI>Mutual a&s;&s;i&s;ting and defending each other.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Mutual Reproof. Two are better than One: for when they fall, the One will lift up his Fellow.</HI></P>
<P>Now, Reproof may be taken either in a more exten&s;ive Sen&s;e, and then it &s;ignifies our rai&s;ing
<PB N="108" REF="004650_0112_100E8E6829C822F0">
a Brother by the gentle&s;t Means, when he falls into Sin and Error; or in a more re&s;trained Signification, as reaching no farther than tho&s;e little Mi&s;carriages, which unavoidably happen in the mo&s;t holy Men living.</P>
<P>The Wi&s;e Man in the Text, &s;uppo&s;es all of us &s;ubject to both: <HI>For when they fall</HI> (&s;ays he, thereby implying that each of us may fall) <HI>the One will lift up his Fellow.</HI> From whence we may infer, that <HI>when any Brother is overtaken with a Fault, he that is &s;piritual</HI> (that is, regene|rate, and knows the Corruption and Weakne&s;s of Human Nature) <HI>ought to re&s;tore &s;uch a one in the Spirit of Meckne&s;s.</HI> And why he &s;hould do &s;o, the Apo&s;tle &s;ubjoins a Rea&s;on <HI>con&s;idering thy&s;elf, le&s;t thou al&s;o be tempted; i. e.</HI> con&s;idering thy own Frailty, le&s;t thou al&s;o fall by the like Temptation.</P>
<P>We are all frail un&s;table Creatures; and it is merely owing to the <HI>Free Grace and good Provi|dence of GOD,</HI> that we <HI>run not into the &s;ame Exce&s;s of Riot</HI> with other Men. Every offend|ing Brother, therefore, claims our <HI>Pity</HI> rather than our <HI>Re&s;entment;</HI> and each Member &s;hould &s;trive who &s;hould be mo&s;t forward, as well as mo&s;t gentle, in re&s;toring him to his former State.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing a Per&s;on not to be <HI>overtaken,</HI> but to fall <HI>wilfully</HI> into a Crime; yet who art thou that denie&s;t Forgivene&s;s to thy offending Brother? <HI>Let him that &s;tandeth take heed le&s;t be fall.</HI> Take ye, Brethren, the holy Apo&s;tles as eminent Examples for you to learn by, how you
<PB N="109" REF="004650_0113_100DDB89E5EF8C40">
ought to behave in this Matter. Con&s;ider how quickly they joined the Right Hand of Fellow|&s;hip with <HI>Peter,</HI> who had &s;o wilfully denied his Ma&s;ter: For we find <HI>John</HI> and him together but two Days after, <HI>John</HI> xx. 2. And <HI>ver.</HI> 19, we find him a&s;&s;embled with the re&s;t. So &s;oon did they forgive, &s;o &s;oon a&s;&s;ociate with their &s;inful, yet relenting Brother&mdash;<HI>Let us go and do likewi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>But there is another kind of Reproof incum|bent on every Member of a <HI>Religious Society;</HI> namely, <HI>a gentle Rebuke for &s;ome Mi&s;carriage or other, which, though not actually &s;inful, yet may become the Occa&s;ion of Sin.</HI> This indeed &s;eems a more ea&s;y, but perhaps will be found a more difficult Point than the former: For when a Per&s;on has really &s;inned, he cannot but own his Brethrens Reproof to be ju&s;t; whereas, when it was only for &s;ome little Mi&s;conduct, the Pride that is in our Natures, will &s;carce &s;uffer us to brook it. But however ungrateful this Pill may be to our Brother, yet if we have any Con|cern for his Welfare, it mu&s;t be admini&s;tred by &s;ome friendly Hand or other. By all Means then let it be applied; only, like a &s;kilful Phy&s;ician, <HI>gild</HI> over the ungrateful Medicine, and endeavour if po&s;&s;ible, to <HI>deceive</HI> thy Brother into Health and Soundne&s;s. <HI>Let all Bitterne&s;s, and Wrath, and Malice, and Evil-&s;peaking, be put away</HI> from it. Let the Patient know his Recovery is the only Thing aimed at, that thou delighte&s;t not <HI>cau&s;ele&s;ly to grieve thy Brother;</HI> and then thou can&s;t not want Succe&s;s.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="110" REF="004650_0114_100DDB8BCD82FC00">
2. <HI>Mutual Exhortation</HI> is the &s;econd Duty re&s;ulting from the Words of the Text.&mdash;<HI>Again, if Two lye together, then they have Heat.</HI></P>
<P>Ob&s;erve here again, the Wi&s;e Man &s;uppo&s;es it as impo&s;&s;ible for Religious Per&s;ons to meet together, and not to be the Warmer for each other's Company, as for two Per&s;ons to lie in the &s;ame Bed, and yet freeze with Cold. But now, how is it po&s;&s;ible to communicate Heat to each other, without mutually <HI>&s;tirring up the Gift of GOD</HI> which is in us, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Exhortation? Let every Member then of a <HI>Religious Society</HI> write that zealous Apo&s;tle's Advice on the Tables of his Heart; <HI>See that ye exhort, and provoke one another to Love, and to good Works; and &s;o much the more as you &s;ee the Day of the LORD approaching.</HI> Believe me, Brethren, we have Need of Exhortation to rouze up our &s;leepy Souls, to &s;et us upon our Watch again&s;t the Temptations of the <HI>World,</HI> the <HI>Fle&s;h,</HI> and the <HI>Devil;</HI> to excite us to renounce our&s;elves, to take up our Cro&s;&s;es, and follow our Ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter, and the glorious Company of Saints and Martyrs, <HI>who through Faith have fought the good Fight, and are gone before us to inherit the Promi&s;es.</HI> A third Part, therefore, of the Time wherein a <HI>Religious Society</HI> meets, &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;pent in this important Duty: For what avails it to have our Under&s;tandings enlightened by pious Reading unle&s;s our Wills are at the &s;ame Time inclined, and inflamed by mutual Exhortation, to put it
<PB N="111" REF="004650_0115_100DDB8FA7AC3448">
in Practice? Add to this; that this is the be&s;t Way both to receive and impart Light, and the only Means to pre&s;erve and increa&s;e that Warmth and Heat which each Per&s;on fir&s;t brought with him; GOD &s;o ordering this, as all other &s;piritual Gifts, that <HI>to him that hath, i. e.</HI> improves and communicates what he hath, <HI>&s;hall be given; but from him that hath not, i. e.</HI> does not improve the Heat he hath, <HI>&s;hall be taken away even that which he &s;eemed to have.</HI> So needful, &s;o e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary, is Exhortation to the Good of <HI>Society.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Thirdly and la&s;tly, The Text points out another Duty incumbent on every Member of a <HI>Religious Society, viz.</HI> To <HI>defend each other</HI> from tho&s;e that do oppo&s;e them. <HI>And if One prevail again&s;t him, yet Two &s;hall with&s;tand him; and a Threefold Cord is not quickly broken.</HI></P>
<P>Here the Wi&s;e Man takes it for granted, that <HI>Offences will come,</HI> nay, and that they <HI>may prevail</HI> too. And this is no more than our <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter</HI> has long &s;ince told us. Not indeed, that there is any Thing in <HI>Chri&s;tianity it&s;elf</HI> that has the lea&s;t Tendency to give ri&s;e to, or promote &s;uch Offences: No, on the contrary, it breathes nothing but Unity and Love.</P>
<P>But &s;o it is, that ever &s;ince the fatal Sentence pronounced by GOD, after our fir&s;t Parents Fall, <HI>viz. I will put Enmity between thy Seed and her Seed; He that is born after the Fle&s;h,</HI> that is, the unregenerate unconverted Sinner, has in all Ages <HI>per&s;ecuted him that is born after
<PB N="112" REF="004650_0116_100DDB912CD00008">
the Spirit:</HI> And &s;o it always will be. Accor|dingly we find an early Proof given of this in the In&s;tance of <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Abel;</HI> and of <HI>I&s;hmael</HI> and <HI>I&s;aac;</HI> of <HI>Jacob</HI> and <HI>E&s;au</HI> afterwards. And indeed, the whole <HI>Bible</HI> contains little el&s;e but an Hi&s;tory of the great and continued Oppo&s;ition between the Children of this World and the Children of GOD. The fir&s;t <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> were remarkable Examples of this; and though tho&s;e trouble&s;ome Times, ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, are now over, yet the Apo&s;tle has laid it down as a general Rule, and all that are &s;incere can expe|rimentally prove the Truth of it. That <HI>they that will live godly in</HI> CHRIST JESUS, <HI>mu&s;t</HI> (to the End of the World, in &s;ome Degree or other) <HI>&s;uffer Per&s;ecution.</HI> That therefore this may not make us de&s;ert our Ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter's Cau&s;e, every Member &s;hould unite their Forces, in order to &s;tand again&s;t it. And for the better effecting this, each would do well, from Time to Time, to communicate his Experiences, Grievances, and Temptations, and beg his Companions (fir&s;t asking GOD's A&s;&s;i&s;tance, without which all is nothing) to admini&s;ter Reproof, Exhortation or Comfort, as his Ca&s;e requires: So that <HI>if One cannot prevail again&s;t it, yet Two &s;hall with&s;tand it; and a Threefold</HI> (much le&s;s a many-fold) <HI>Cord will not be quickly broken.</HI></P>
<P>IV. But it is Time for me to proceed to the <HI>Fourth general Thing</HI> propo&s;ed, <HI>viz.</HI> To draw an Inference or two from what has been &s;aid.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="113" REF="004650_0117_100DDB93DB531630">
1. And fir&s;t then, if <HI>Two are better than One,</HI> and the Advantages of <HI>Religious Society</HI> are &s;o many and &s;o great, then it is the Duty of every true <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> to &s;et on Foot, e&s;tabli&s;h and pro|mote, as much as in him lies, <HI>Societies</HI> of this Nature. And I believe we may venture to affirm, that if ever a Spirit of true Chri&s;tianity is revived in the World, it mu&s;t be brought about by &s;ome &s;uch Means as this. Motives, &s;urely, cannot be wanting, to &s;tir us up to this commendable and nece&s;&s;ary Undertaking: For granting all hitherto advanced to be of no Force, yet methinks the &s;ingle Con&s;ideration that great Part of our Happine&s;s in Heaven will con&s;i&s;t in the <HI>Communion of Saints;</HI> or that the Intere&s;t as well as Piety of tho&s;e Sectari&s;ts that differ from us, is &s;trengthened and &s;upported by nothing more than their frequent Meetings; either of the&s;e Con&s;iderations, I &s;ay, one would think, &s;hould induce us to do our utmo&s;t to copy after their good Example, and &s;ettle a la&s;ting and pious <HI>Communion of the Saints</HI> on Earth. Add to this that we find the Kingdom of Darkne&s;s e&s;tabli&s;h|ed daily by &s;uch like Means; and &s;hall not the Kingdom of CHRIST be &s;et in Oppo&s;ition again&s;t it? Shall the Children of <HI>Belial</HI> a&s;&s;emble and &s;trengthen each other in Wickedne&s;s; and &s;hall not the Children of GOD unite, and &s;trengthen them&s;elves in Piety? Shall Societies on Societies be countenanced for Midnight Revellings, and the promoting of <HI>Vice,</HI> and &s;carcely one be found intended for the Propagation of <HI>Virtue?</HI>&mdash;Be a&s;toni&s;hed, O Heavens at this!</P>

2. But this leads me to a &s;econd Inference; namely, to warn Per&s;ons of the great Danger tho&s;e are in, who either by their Sub&s;criptions, Pre&s;ence or Approbation, promote <HI>Societies</HI> of a quite oppo&s;ite Nature to Religion.</P>
<P>And here I would not be under&s;tood to mean only tho&s;e Publick Meetings which are de&s;igned manife&s;tly for nothing el&s;e but Revellings and Banquetings, for Chambering and Wantonne&s;s, and at which a mode&s;t <HI>Heathen</HI> would blu&s;h to be pre&s;ent; but al&s;o tho&s;e &s;eemingly <HI>innocent</HI> Entertainments and Meetings which the <HI>politer</HI> Part of the World are &s;o very fond of, and &s;pend &s;o much Time in: But which notwith|&s;tanding, keep as many Per&s;ons out of a Sen&s;e of <HI>True Religion,</HI> as Intemperance, Debauchery or any other Crime whatever. Indeed, whil&s;t we are in this World, we mu&s;t have proper Relaxations, to fit us both for the Bu&s;ine&s;s of our Profe&s;&s;ion, and Religion.

<P>IF we enquire, why there is &s;o little <HI>Love</HI> to be found among&s;t <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> why the very Characteri&s;tick, by which every one &s;hould know that we are Di&s;ciples of the Holy JESUS, is almo&s;t bani&s;hed out of the Chri&s;tian World,&mdash;We &s;hall find it, in a great Mea&s;ure, owing to a Neglect or &s;uperficial Performance of that mo&s;t God-like Part of &s;ecret Prayer <HI>Interce&s;&s;ion,</HI> or imploring the Divine Grace or Mercy in behalf of others.</P>
<P>Some forget this Duty of Praying for others, becau&s;e they &s;eldom remember to pray for them|&s;elves: And even good People, who are con&s;tant in Praying to their Father which is in Heaven, are often &s;o con&s;trained and &s;elfi&s;h in their Addre&s;&s;es to the Throne of Grace, that they do not enlarge their Petitions for the Welfare of their Fellow Chri&s;tians as they ought; and thereby fall &s;hort of attaining that Chri&s;tian

Charity, that unfeigned Love of their Brethren, which their &s;acred Profe&s;&s;ion obliges them to a&s;pire after, and without which, though they would <HI>be&s;tow all their Goods to feed the Poor, and even give their Bodies to be burned, yet it would profit them nothing.</HI></P>
<P>Since then the&s;e Things are &s;o, I &s;hall from the Words of the Text (tho' originally intended to be more confined) endeavour to &s;hew,

<P>Now <HI>Prayer</HI> is a Duty founded on Natural Religion; the very <HI>Heathens</HI> never neglected it, though many <HI>Chri&s;tian Heathens</HI> among&s;t us do:&mdash;And it is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> that you might as rea&s;onably expect to find a living Man without Breath, as a true <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> without the Spirit of Prayer and Supplication.&mdash;Thus, no &s;ooner was St. <HI>Paul</HI> converted, but <HI>behold he prayeth,</HI> faith the Lord Almighty. And thus will it be with every Child of GOD, as &s;oon as he becomes &s;uch: Prayer being truly called, <HI>The natural Cry of the New-born Soul.</HI></P>

For in the Heart of every True Believ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> there is a Heavenly Tendency, a Divine Attraction, which as &s;en&s;ibly draws him to conver&s;e with GOD, as the Load-&s;tone attracts the Needle.</P>
<P>A deep Sen&s;e of their own Weakne&s;s, and of CHRIST'S Fulne&s;s; a &s;trong Conviction of their Natural Corruption, and of the Nece&s;&s;ity of renewing Grace; will not let them <HI>re&s;t from crying Day and Night</HI> to their Almighty Redeem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, that the Divine Image, which they lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> in <HI>Adam,</HI> may through his All-powerful Mediat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> and the Sanctifying Operations of his ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, be begun, carried on, aud fully perfected both in their Souls and Bodies.</P>
<P>Thus earne&s;t, thus importunate, are all &s;incere <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> in praying for them&s;elves: But then, not having &s;o lively, la&s;ting, and deep a Sen&s;e of the Wants of their Chri&s;tian Brethren, they are for the mo&s;t Part too remi&s;s and defective in their Prayers for <HI>them</HI>&mdash;Whereas, was the <HI>Love of GOD</HI> &s;hed abroad in our Hearts, and did we Love our Neighbour in that Manner in which the Son of GOD our Saviour <HI>loveth us,</HI> and according to his Command and Example, we could not but be as importunate for their Spiritual and Temporal Welfare, as for our own; and as earne&s;tly de&s;ire and endeavour that others &s;hould &s;hare in the Benefits of the Death and Pa&s;&s;ion of JESUS CHRIST as we our&s;elves.</P>
<P>Let not any one think, that this is an uncom|mon Degree of Charity; an high Pitch of Per|fection, which every one cannot attain unto;

&s;ince it is no &s;uch Thing:&mdash;For if we are all commanded to <HI>Love our Neighbour</HI> (that is every Man) even <HI>as our&s;elves,</HI> nay to <HI>Lay down our Lives for the Brethren;</HI> then, it is the Duty of <HI>all</HI> to pray for their Neighbours as much as for them&s;elves, and by all po&s;&s;ible Acts and Expre&s;|&s;ions of Love and Affection towards them, at all Times, to &s;hew their Readine&s;s even to lay down their Lives for them, if ever it &s;hould plea&s;e GOD to call them to it.</P>
<P>Our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour as He hath &s;et us an Example, that we &s;hould follow his Steps in every Thing el&s;e, &s;o hath he more e&s;pecially in This:&mdash;For in that mo&s;t Divine, that mo&s;t Perfect and inimitable Prayer (recorded in the 17th of St. <HI>John</HI>) which he put up ju&s;t before his Pa&s;&s;ion, we find but <HI>few</HI> Petitions for his own, though <HI>many</HI> for his Di&s;ciples Welfare&punc; And in that mo&s;t perfect Form which he has been plea&s;ed to pre&s;cribe us, we are taught to &s;ay,&mdash;not <HI>My,</HI> but <HI>Our Father,</HI>&mdash;Thereby to put us in mind, that, whenever we approach the Throne of Grace, we ought to pray,&mdash;not in our own Name alone, but in the Name of all our Brethren in CHRIST.</P>
<P><HI>Interce&s;&s;ion</HI> then is certainly a Duty incumbent upon all <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI></P>
<P>II. Whom we are to intercede for, and How this Duty is to be performed, comes next to be con&s;idered,&mdash;under my <HI>Second general Head.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. And fir&s;t, our <HI>Interce&s;&s;ion</HI> mu&s;t be univer&s;al. <HI>I will,</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, <HI>that Prayers, Supplications

and Interce&s;&s;ions, be made for all Men:</HI> For as <HI>GOD's Mercy is over all his Works,</HI> as JESUS CHRIST died to <HI>Redeem a People out of all Nations and Languages;</HI> &s;o, we &s;hould pray, that <HI>all Men may come to the Knowledge of the Truth, and be &s;aved.</HI> Many precious Promi&s;es are made in Holy Writ, that <HI>the Go&s;pel &s;hall be publi&s;hed through the whole World,</HI> that <HI>the Earth &s;hall be covered with the Knowledge of the LORD, as the Waters cover the Sea:</HI> And therefore it is our Duty not to confine our Petitions to our own Nation, but to pray that all tho&s;e Nations, <HI>who now &s;it in Darkne&s;s and in the Shadow of Death, may have the glorious Go&s;pel &s;hine out upon Them, as well as upon Us. But you need not that any Man &s;hould teach you this, &s;ince ye your&s;elves are taught of GOD, even of</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>him&s;elf, to Pray, that his Kingdom may come;</HI> Part of the Meaning of which Petition is, That <HI>GOD's Ways may be known upon Earth, and his Saving Health among All Nations.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Next to the Praying for all Men, we &s;hould, according to St. <HI>Paul's</HI> Rule, Pray for <HI>Kings;</HI> particularly, for our pre&s;ent Sovereign King GEORGE, and all that are put <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Authority under him: That we may lead <HI>quiet Lives, in all Godline&s;s and Hone&s;ty,</HI>&mdash;For, if we con&s;ider how heavy the Burden of Government is, and how much the Welfare of any People depends on the Zeal and godly Conver&s;ation of tho&s;e that have the Rule over them: If we &s;et before us the many
<PB N="123" REF="004650_0127_100DDBAD3B81F688">
Dangers and Difficulties, to which Governors by their Station are expo&s;ed, and the continual Temptations they lie under to Luxury and Self-Indulgence; we &s;hall not only pity, but pray for them,&mdash;That He who pre&s;erved <HI>E&s;ther, David,</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;iah, unspotted from the World,</HI> amid&s;t the Grandeur of a Court, and gave Succe&s;s to their De&s;igns, would al&s;o pre&s;erve them Holy and Unblameable, and pro&s;per all the Works of their Hands upon them.</P>
<P N="3">3. But, <HI>Thirdly,</HI> you ought, in a more e&s;pecial Manner, to pray for tho&s;e, whom <HI>the Holy Gho&s;t hath made Over&s;eers over You.</HI> This is what: St. <HI>Paul</HI> begs, again and again, of the Churches to whom he writes:&mdash;<HI>Brethren,</HI> &s;ays he in the Text, <HI>Pray for Us;</HI> and again, in his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Ephe&s;ians,&mdash;Praying always,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>with all Manner of Supplication; and for me al&s;o, that I may open my Mouth boldly, to declare the My&s;tery of the Go&s;pel.</HI> And in another Place, to expre&s;s his Earne&s;tne&s;s in this Reque&s;t, and the great Importance of their Prayers to Him,&mdash;He bids the Church <HI>Strive,</HI> (or, as the original Word &s;ignifies, <HI>Be in an Agony) together with Him in their Prayers.</HI> And surely, if the great St. <HI>Paul,</HI> that cho&s;en Ve&s;&s;el, that Favourite of Heaven, needed the mo&s;t importunate Prayers of his Chri&s;tian Converts; much more do the ordinary Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel &s;tand in Need of the <HI>Interce&s;&s;ion</HI> of their re&s;pective Flocks.</P>
<P>And I cannot but in a more e&s;pecial Man|ner, in&s;i&s;t upon this Branch of your Duty,
<PB N="124" REF="004650_0128_100DDBB1C1BDE470">
becau&s;e it is a Matter of &s;uch Importance: For no doubt, much Good is frequently with-held from many, by Rea&s;on of their neglecting to pray for their Mini&s;ters, which they would have received, had they prayed for them as they ought. Not to mention, that People often complain of the Want of diligent and faithful Pa&s;tors.&mdash;But how do they de&s;erve Good Pa&s;tors, who will not earne&s;tly pray to GOD for <HI>&s;uch?</HI></P>
<P>The Church has &s;et a-part Four Sea&s;ons in the Year for this Purpo&s;e, and to call down a Ble&s;&s;ing on tho&s;e who are to be ordained to any Holy Function: But by how very few are the <HI>Ember Days</HI> ob&s;erved! And if we will not <HI>pray to the Lord of the Harve&s;t,</HI> can it be expected, <HI>he will &s;end forth Labourers into his Harve&s;t?</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides, What Ingratitude is it, not to pray for your Mini&s;ters! For &s;hall they Watch and Labour in the Word of Doctrine for you, and for your Salvation, and &s;hall not you pray for them in Return? If <HI>any</HI> be&s;tow Favours on your Bodies, you think it right, meet, and your bounden Duty, to <HI>pray for Them;</HI> and &s;hall not they be remembred in your Prayers, who daily feed and nouri&s;h your Souls? Add to all this, that praying for your Mini&s;ters, will be a manife&s;t Proof of your believing,&mdash;That though <HI>Paul</HI> plant, and <HI>Apollos</HI> water, yet it is GOD alone who giveth the Increa&s;e. And you will al&s;o find it the be&s;t Means you can u&s;e, to promote your own Welfare: Becau&s;e GOD, in An&s;wer to your Prayers, may impart a double

Portion of his Holy Spirit to them, whereby they will be qualified to deal out to you larger Mea&s;ures of Knowledge in Spiritual Things, and be enabled more &s;kilfully <HI>to divide the Word of Truth.</HI></P>
<P>Would Men but con&s;tantly ob&s;erve this Direction, and when their Mini&s;ters are <HI>praying</HI> in their Name to GOD,&mdash;humbly be&s;eech him to perform all their Petitions: Or, when they are &s;peaking in GOD's Name to them,&mdash;pray that <HI>the Holy Gho&s;t may fall on all them that hear the Word;</HI> we &s;hould <HI>then</HI> find a more vi&s;ible good Effect of their Doctrine, and a greater Mutual Love between Mini&s;ters and their People. For Mini&s;ters Hands would <HI>then</HI> be held up by the People's Interce&s;&s;ions, and the People will never dare to vilify or traduce tho&s;e who are the con|&s;tant Subject of their Prayers.</P>
<P N="4">4. Next to our Mini&s;ters, our <HI>Friends</HI> claim a Place in our <HI>Interce&s;&s;ions;</HI> but then we &s;hould not content our&s;elves with Praying in general Terms for them, but &s;uit our Prayers to their particular Circum&s;tances.

Is a Friend in Doubt in a Matter? We &s;hould lay his Ca&s;e before GOD, as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> did that of the Daughters of <HI>Zelophehad,</HI> and pray, That GOD's Holy Spirit may lead him into all Truth. Is he in Want? We &s;hould pray, That his Faith may never fail, and that in GOD's due Time he may be relieved. And in all other Ca&s;es, we &s;hould not pray for our Friends <HI>only in Generals,</HI> but &s;uit our Petitions to their <HI>particular Sufferings and Afflictions;</HI> for otherwi&s;e, we may never ask perhaps for the Things our Friends <HI>mo&s;t want</HI></P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that &s;uch a Procedure will oblige us &s;ometimes to break from the Forms we u&s;e; but if we accu&s;tom our&s;elves to it, and have a deep Sen&s;e of what we ask for, the mo&s;t illiterate <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> will not want Words to ex|pre&s;s them&s;elves.</P>
<P>We have many noble In&s;tances in Holy Scripture of the Succe&s;s of this Kind of <HI>parti|cular Interce&s;&s;ion;</HI> but none more remarkable than that of <HI>Abraham's</HI> Servant, in the Book of <HI>Gene&s;is,</HI>&mdash;who being &s;ent to &s;eek a Wife for his Son <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> prays in a mo&s;t particular Manner in his Behalf.&mdash;And the Sequel of the Story informs us how remarkably his Prayer was an&s;wered.

And <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> it will fill your Hearts with <HI>Love one to another.</HI>&mdash;He that every Day inter|cedes at the Throne of Grace for all Mankind, cannot but in a &s;hort Time be filled with Love and Charity to <HI>all:</HI> and the frequent Exerci&s;e of his Love in this Manner, will in&s;en&s;ibly enlarge his Heart, and make him Partaker of that ex|ceeding Abundance of it which is in CHRIST JESUS our LORD! Envy, Malice, Revenge, and &s;uch like helli&s;h Tempers, can never long har|bour in a gracious Interce&s;&s;or's Brea&s;t;&mdash;But He will be filled with Joy, Peace, Meekne&s;s, Long Suffering, and all other Gifts and Graces of the Holy Spirit. By frequently laying his Neigh|bour's Wants before GOD, He will be touched with a Fellow-Feeling of them;&mdash;He will re|joice with tho&s;e that do rejoice, and weep with tho&s;e that weep.&mdash;Every Ble&s;&s;ing be&s;towed on Others, in&s;tead of exciting Envy in him, will be looked on as an An&s;wer to his particular In|terce&s;&s;ion, and fill his Soul with <HI>Joy un&s;peakable and full of Glory.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed I will not affirm, that this ble&s;&s;ed Temper of Mind can be acquired all at once: No,&mdash;as other Graces, &s;o mu&s;t this Chri&s;tian Love be obtained by Degrees. But do you a|bound in Acts of general and particular Interce&s;|&s;ions; and when you hear of your Neighbour's Faults, in&s;tead of relating them to, and expo&s;ing them before others,&mdash;Lay them in &s;ecret before
<PB N="129" REF="004650_0133_100DDBBFB9F20BA0">
GOD. and beg of him to correct and amend them. When you hear of a notorious Sinner, in&s;tead of thinking, <HI>You do well to be angry;</HI> beg of JESUS CHRIST to convert and make him a Monument of his Free Grace; and you cannot imagine what a ble&s;&s;ed Alteration this Practice will make in your Heart, and how much you will increa&s;e Day by Day in the Spirit of Love and Meekne&s;s towards all Mankind!</P>
<P>But, further to excite you to the con&s;tant Practice of this Duty of Interce&s;&s;ion; con&s;ider the many In&s;tances given us in Holy Scripture, of the Power and Efficacy of it. Great and ex|cellent Things are there recorded as the Effects of this divine Employ. It has &s;topped Plagues, it has opened and &s;hut Heaven; and has fre|quently turned away GOD's Fury from his People. How was <HI>Abimelech's</HI> Hou&s;e freed from the Di&s;ea&s;e GOD &s;ent among&s;t them, at the Interce&s;&s;ion of <HI>Abraham!</HI> When <HI>Phineas &s;tood up and prayed,</HI> how &s;oon did <HI>the Plague cea&s;e!</HI> When <HI>Daniel</HI> humbled and afflicted his Soul, and inter|ceded for the LORD's Inheritance, how quickly was an Angel di&s;patched to tell him, <HI>his Prayer was heard!</HI> And to mention but one In&s;tance more, how does GOD own him&s;elf as it were quite overcome with the Importunity of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> when he was interceding for his idolatrous People,&mdash;<HI>Let me alone,</HI> &s;ays GOD!</P>
<P>This &s;ufficiently &s;hews, I could almo&s;t &s;ay the Omnipotency of Interce&s;&s;ion, and how we may, like <HI>Jacob,</HI> wre&s;tle with GOD, and by an holy

Violence prevail both for our&s;elves and others. And no doubt 'tis owing to the &s;ecret and pre|vailing Interce&s;&s;ions of the <HI>few</HI> righteous Souls who &s;till remain among us, that GOD has yet &s;pared this mi&s;erably &s;inful Nation: For were there not &s;ome &s;uch Faithful ones, like <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> left to &s;tand in the Gap,&mdash;We &s;hould &s;oon be de&s;troyed, even as was <HI>Sodom,</HI> and reduced to A&s;hes like unto <HI>Gomorrah.</HI></P>
<P>But, to &s;tir you up yet farther, to this God|like Exerci&s;e of <HI>Interce&s;&s;ion,</HI> con&s;ider that, in all Probability, it is the frequent Employment even of the glorified Saints: For though they are de|livered from the Burden of the Fle&s;h, and re&s;tored to the glorious Liberty of the Sons of GOD, yet as their Happine&s;s cannot be perfectly con&s;ummated 'till the Re&s;urrection of the la&s;t Day, when all their Brethren will be glorified with them,&mdash;We cannot but think they are often importunate in be&s;eeching our heavenly Father, &s;hortly to ac|compli&s;h the Number of his Elect, and to ha&s;ten his Kingdom. And &s;hall not we, who are on Earth, be often exerci&s;ed in this divine Employ with the glorious Company of <HI>the Spirits of ju&s;t Men made perfect?</HI> Since our Happine&s;s is &s;o much to con&s;i&s;t in the Communion of Saints in the Church Triumphant <HI>above,</HI> &s;hall we not fre|quently intercede for the Church Militant <HI>here be|low;</HI> and earne&s;tly beg, that we may all be one, even as the Holy JESUS and his Father are One; that we may al&s;o be made perfect in one!</P>
<P>To provoke you to this great Work and La|bour of Love,&mdash;Remember that it is the never
<PB N="131" REF="004650_0135_100DDBC4CCCDCD30">
cea&s;ing Employment of the holy and highly-ex|alted JESUS him&s;elf, who &s;its at the Right Hand of GOD to hear all our Prayers and to make continual Interce&s;&s;ion for us! So that he who is con&s;tantly employed in interceding for others, is doing <HI>that</HI> on Earth, which the Eternal Son of GOD is always doing in Heaven.</P>
<P>Imagine therefore, when you are lifting up holy Hands in Prayer for one another,&mdash;That you &s;ee the Heavens opened, and the Son of GOD in all his Glory, as the Great High Prie&s;t of your Salvation, offering up and pleading for you, the all-&s;ufficient Merit of his Sacrifice before the Throne of his heavenly Father!&mdash;Join then Your Interce&s;&s;ions with his, and be&s;eech him, that <HI>they</HI> may through him come up as Incen&s;e, and be received as a Sweet-&s;melling Savour, ac|ceptable in the Sight of GOD! This Imagina|tion will &s;trengthen your Faith, excite a holy Earne&s;tne&s;s in your Prayers, and make you wre&s;tle with GOD, as <HI>Jacob</HI> did, when <HI>He &s;aw him Face to Face and his Life was pre&s;erved;</HI> as <HI>Abraham,</HI> when he pleaded for <HI>Sodom;</HI> and as JESUS CHRIST him&s;elf, when he prayed, being in an Agony, &s;o much the more earne&s;tly the Night before his bitter Pa&s;&s;ion!</P>
<P>And now, Brethren, What &s;hall I &s;ay more, &s;ince <HI>you are taught of</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> to <HI>abound in Love,</HI> and in this <HI>good Work</HI> of Pray|ing one for another?&mdash;However, I cannot but recommend to you one general Means in order <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> make your interce&s;&s;ion more effectual, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> To <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;uch Lives as may make your

<P>However, I cannot but in an e&s;pecial manner pre&s;s this upon you <HI>now,</HI> becau&s;e all Ye, among&s;t whom I have now been Preaching, in all Proba|bility will &s;ee me no more:&mdash;For I am now g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|ing (I tru&s;t under the Conduct of GOD's Mo&s;t

<P>THESE Words contain the holy Re&s;olution of pious <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> who having in a mo&s;t moving, affectionate Di&s;cour&s;e recounted to the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> what great Things GOD had done for them, in the Ver&s;e immediately going be|fore the Text, comes to draw a proper Inference from what he had been delivering; and ac|quaints them, in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing Terms, that &s;ince GOD had been &s;o exceeding gracious unto them, they could do no le&s;s than out of Gratitude for &s;uch uncommon Favours and Mercies, dedicate both them&s;elves and Families to his Service. <HI>Now therefore,</HI> &s;ays he, Ver&s;e 14. <HI>fear the LORD, and &s;erve him in Sincerity and Truth, and put away the Gods which your Fathers &s;erved on the other Side of the Flood.</HI> And by the &s;ame engaging Motive does the Prophet <HI>Samuel</HI> afterwards enforce their Obedience

<P>A Re&s;olution this worthy of <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> and no le&s;s becoming, no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary for every true Son of <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> that is intru&s;ted with the Care and Government of a Family in our Day: And, if it was ever &s;ea&s;onable for Mini&s;ters to preach up, or People to put in Practice <HI>Family Religion,</HI> it was never more &s;o than in the pre&s;ent Age; &s;ince it is greatly to be feared, that out of tho&s;e many Hou&s;holds that call them&s;elves <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> there are but few that &s;erve GOD in their re&s;pective Families as they ought.</P>
<P>It is true indeed, vi&s;it our Churches, and you may perhaps &s;ee &s;omething of the <HI>Form of Godline&s;s</HI> &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting among&s;t us; but even

That is &s;carcely to be met with in private Hou&s;es. So that were the ble&s;&s;ed Angels to come, as in the patriarchal Age, and ob&s;erve our &s;piritual Oeconomy at home, would they not be tempted to &s;ay as <HI>Abraham</HI> &s;aid to <HI>Abimelech, Surely, the Fear of GOD is not in this Place?</HI> Gen. xx. 11.</P>
<P>How &s;uch a general Neglect of <HI>Family-Religion</HI> fir&s;t began to over&s;pread the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> World, is difficult to determine. As for the primitive <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> I am po&s;itive it was not &s;o with them: No, they had not &s;o learned CHRIST, as fal&s;ely to imagine Religion was to be confined &s;olely to their A&s;&s;emblies for publick Wor&s;hip; but on the contrary, behaved with &s;uch Piety and exemplary Holine&s;s in their private Families, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> often &s;tiles their Hou&s;e a Church: <HI>Salute &s;uch a One,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>and the Church which is in his Hou&s;e.</HI> And, I believe, we mu&s;t forever de&s;pair of &s;eeing a primitive Spirit of Piety revived in the World, till we are &s;o happy as to &s;ee a Revival of pri|mitive <HI>Family-Religion;</HI> and Per&s;ons unanimou&s;ly re&s;olving with good old <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> in the Words of the Text, <HI>As for me and my Hou&s;e, we will &s;erve the LORD.</HI></P>
<P>From which Words I &s;hall beg Leave to in&s;i&s;t on the&s;e Three Things.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That it is the Duty of every Go|vernor of a Family to take Care, that not only he him&s;elf, but al&s;o that tho&s;e commit|ted to his Charge, <HI>&s;erve the LORD.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="139" REF="004650_0143_100DDBDBCE72DA40">
II. <HI>Secondly,</HI> I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew after what Manner a Governor and his Hou&s;|hold ought to <HI>&s;erve the LORD.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>III. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> and <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> I &s;hall offer &s;ome Motives in order to excite all Governors, with their re&s;pective Hou&s;holds, to <HI>&s;erve the LORD</HI> in the Manner that &s;hall be recommended.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>And <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I am to &s;hew that it is the Duty of every Governor of a Family to take Care, that not only he him&s;elf, but al&s;o that tho&s;e committed to his Charge, &s;hould <HI>&s;erve the LORD.</HI></P>
<P>And this will appear, if we con&s;ider that every Governor of a Family ought to look upon him&s;elf as obliged to act in three Capacities: As a Prophet, to in&s;truct; as a Prie&s;t, to pray for and with; as a King, to govern, direct, and provide for them. It is true indeed the latter of the&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> their kingly Office, they are not &s;o frequently deficient in (nay in this they are ge|nerally too &s;ollicitous) but as for the two for|mer, <HI>viz.</HI> their prie&s;tly and prophetick Office, like <HI>Gallio,</HI> they care for no &s;uch Things. But however indifferent &s;ome Governors may be about it, yet they may be a&s;&s;ured, that GOD will require a due Di&s;charge of the&s;e Offices at their Hands. For if, as the Apo&s;tle argues, <HI>He that does not provide for his own Hou&s;e,</HI> in temporal Things, <HI>has denied the Faith, and is wor&s;e than an Infidel;</HI> to what greater Degree of Apo&s;tacy mu&s;t he have arrived, who takes no Thought to provide for the &s;piritual Welfare of his Family.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="004650_0144_100DDBDDB90CACE0">
But farther, Per&s;ons are generally very liberal of their Invectives again&s;t the <HI>Clergy,</HI> and think they ju&s;tly blame the Conduct of that Mini&s;ter who does not take heed to and watch over the Flock, of which the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> has made him Over&s;eer: But may not every Governor of a Family be in a lower Degree, liable to the &s;ame Cen&s;ure, who takes no Thought for tho&s;e Souls that are committed to his Charge? For every Hou&s;e is as it were a little Pari&s;h, every Governor (as was before ob&s;erved) a Prie&s;t, every Family a Flock: And if any of them peri&s;h through the Governour's Neglect, their Blood will GOD require at their Hands.</P>
<P>Was a Mini&s;ter to di&s;regard teaching his People publickly, and from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e, and to excu&s;e him&s;elf by &s;aying, that he had enough to do to work out his own Salvation with Fear and Trembling, without concerning him&s;elf with that of others; would not any one be apt to think &s;uch a Mini&s;ter ro be like the unju&s;t Judge, <HI>One that neither feared GOD, nor regarded Man?</HI> And yet, odious as &s;uch a Character would be, it is no wor&s;e than that Go|vernor of a Family de&s;erves, who thinks him&s;elf obliged only to &s;ave his own Soul, without paying any Regard to the Souls of his Hou&s;hold. For (as was above hinted) every Hou&s;e is as it were, a Pari&s;h, and every Ma&s;ter is concerned to &s;ecure, as much as in him lies, the Spiritual Pro&s;perity of every one under his Roof, as any Mini&s;ter whatever is obliged to look to the Spiri|tual Welfare of every individual Per&s;on under his Charge.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="004650_0145_100DDBE2A3A45038">
What Precedents Men, who neglect their Duty in this Particular, can plead for &s;uch Omi&s;&s;ion, I cannot tell: Doubtle&s;s not the Example of holy <HI>Job,</HI> who was &s;o far from imagining that he had no Concern, as Governor of a Family, with any one's Soul but his own, that the Scripture acquaints us, <HI>When the Days of his Children's Fea&s;ting were gone about, that</HI> Job <HI>&s;ent and &s;anctified them, and offered Burnt-Offerings according to the Number of them all; for</HI> Job <HI>&s;aid, it may be that my Sons have &s;inned and cur&s;ed GOD in their Hearts: Thus did</HI> Job <HI>continually.</HI> Nor can they plead the Practice of good old <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> whom, in the Text, we find as much concerned for his Hou&s;hold's Welfare as his own. Nor la&s;tly, that of <HI>Corne|lius,</HI> who <HI>feared GOD,</HI> not only him&s;elf, but with <HI>all his Hou&s;e:</HI> And were <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> but of the &s;ame Spirit of <HI>Job, Jo&s;hua,</HI> and the <HI>Gentile</HI> Centurion, they would act as <HI>Job, Jo&s;hua</HI> and <HI>Cornelius</HI> did.</P>
<P>But, alas! if this be the Ca&s;e, and all Go|vernors of Families ought not only to &s;erve the LORD them&s;elves, but likewi&s;e to &s;ee that their re&s;pective Hou&s;holds do &s;o too; what will then become of tho&s;e who not only neglect &s;erving GOD them&s;elves, but al&s;o make it their Bu&s;i|ne&s;s to ridicule and &s;coff at any of their Hou&s;e that do? Who are not content with <HI>not entring into the Kingdom of Heaven them&s;elves; but tho&s;e al&s;o that are willing to enter in, they hinder.</HI> Surely &s;uch Men are Factors for the Devil indeed.

not: For altho' GOD, in his good Providence, may &s;uffer &s;uch Stumbling-blocks to be put in his Children's Ways, and &s;uffer their greate&s;t Enemies to be tho&s;e of their own Hou&s;holds, for a Trial of their Sincerity, and Improvement of their Faith; yet we cannot but pronounce a <HI>Woe</HI> again&s;t tho&s;e Ma&s;ters <HI>'by whom &s;uch Offences come:</HI> For if tho&s;e that only take Care of their own Souls can &s;carcely be &s;aved, where will &s;uch mon&s;trous profane and wicked Go|vernors appear?</P>
<P>But hoping there are but few of this unhappy Stamp, proceed we now to the</P>
<P>II. <HI>Second</HI> Thing propo&s;ed, <HI>viz.</HI> To &s;hew after what Manner a Governor and his Hou&s;hold ought to <HI>&s;erve the LORD.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. And the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Thing I &s;hall mention is reading the Word of GOD. This is a Duty incumbent on every private Per&s;on. <HI>Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have Eternal Life,</HI> is a Precept given by our Ble&s;&s;ed LORD indifferently to all: But much more &s;o ought every Governor of a Family to think it in a peculiar Manner &s;poken to him&s;elf, becau&s;e (as hath heen already proved) he ought to look upon him&s;elf as a Prophet, and therefore, agreeably to &s;uch a Character, as bound to in|&s;truct tho&s;e under his Charge in the Knowledge of the Word of GOD.</P>
<P>This we find was the Order GOD gave his peculiar People of <HI>I&s;rael:</HI> For thus &s;peaks his Repre&s;entative <HI>Mo&s;es, Deuteronomy</HI> vi. 6, 7. <HI>The&s;e Words,</HI> that is, the Scripture Words,
<PB N="143" REF="004650_0147_100DDBE6DEBC60B0">
<HI>which I command thee this Day, &s;hall be in thy Heart, and thou &s;halt teach them diligently unto thy Children,</HI> that is, as it is generally explained, <HI>Servants,</HI> as well as Children, <HI>and &s;hall talk of them when thou &s;itte&s;t in thy Hou&s;e.</HI> From whence we may infer, that the only Rea&s;on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o many neglect to read the Words of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> diligently to their Children is, becau&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Words of Scripture are not in their Hearts: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> if they were, out of the Abundance of the Heart their Mouth would &s;peak.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, Servants as well as Children are, for the Generality, very ignorant, and mere Novices in the Laws of GOD: And how &s;hall they know, unle&s;s &s;ome one teach them? And what more proper to teach them by, than the lively Oracles of GOD, <HI>which are able to make them wi&s;e unto Salvation?</HI> And who more proper to in&s;truct them by the&s;e lively Oracles, than Parents and Ma&s;ters, who (as hath been more than once ob&s;erved) are as much concerned to feed them with &s;piritual as with bodily Bread, Day by Day.</P>
<P>But if the&s;e Things be &s;o, what a mi&s;erable Condition are tho&s;e unhappy Governors in, who are &s;o far from feeding tho&s;e committed to their Care with the &s;incere Milk of the Word, to the Intent they may grow thereby, that they neither &s;earch the Scriptures them&s;elves, nor are careful to explain them to others? Such Fami|lies mu&s;t be in a happy Way indeed to do their Ma&s;ter's Will, who take &s;uch prodigious Pains to know it! Would one not imagine that they
<PB N="144" REF="004650_0148_100DDBE8E881D7B0">
had turned Converts to the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> that they thought <HI>Ignorance</HI> the Mother of <HI>Devotion;</HI> that tho&s;e were to be condemned as Hereticks who read their <HI>Bibles?</HI> And yet how few Families are there among&s;t us, who do not act after this un&s;eemly Manner! But <HI>&s;hall I prai&s;e them in this? I prai&s;e them not: Brethren, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Thing ought not &s;o to be.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Pa&s;s we on now to the &s;econd Means whereby every Governor and his Hou&s;hold ought to &s;erve the LORD, <HI>viz. Family Prayer.</HI></P>
<P>This is a Duty, though as much neglected, yet as ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary as the former. <HI>Reading</HI> is a good Preparative for <HI>Prayer,</HI> as <HI>Prayer</HI> is an excellent Means to render <HI>Reading</HI> effectual. And the Rea&s;on why every Governor of a Family &s;hould join both the&s;e Exerci&s;es together, is plain, becau&s;e a Governor of a Fa|mily cannot perform his <HI>Prie&s;tly</HI> Office (which we before ob&s;erved he is in &s;ome Degree inve&s;ted with) without performing this Duty of <HI>Family Prayer.</HI></P>
<P>We find it therefore remarked, when men|tion is made of <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Abel'</HI>s offering Sacri|fices, that they <HI>brought</HI> them. But to whom did they bring them? Why, in all Probability to their Father <HI>Adam,</HI> who, as Prie&s;t of the Family, was to offer Sacrifice in their Names. And &s;o likewi&s;e ought every &s;piritual Son of the &s;econd <HI>Adam,</HI> who is intru&s;ted with the Care of an Hou&s;hold, to offer up the &s;piritual Sacrifices of Supplications and Thang&s;givings, acceptable to GOD through JESUS CHRIST, in the Pre&s;ence
<PB N="145" REF="004650_0149_100DDBEA733D3FA0">
and Name of all who wait upon, or eat Meat at his Table.</P>
<P>Thus we read our Ble&s;&s;ed LORD behaved, when he tabernacled among&s;t us: For it is &s;aid often, that <HI>he was alone</HI> praying with his twelve Di&s;ciples, which was then his little Family. And he him&s;elf has promi&s;ed a particular Ble&s;&s;ing to joint Supplications: <HI>For where&s;oever,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>two or three are gathered together in my Name, there am I in the Mid&s;t of them.</HI> And again, <HI>If two or three are agreed touching any Thing they &s;hall a&s;k, it &s;hall be given them.</HI> Add to this, that we are commanded by the Apo&s;tle to <HI>pray always, with all Manner of Supplication,</HI> which doubtle&s;s includes <HI>Family Prayer.</HI> And holy <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> when he &s;et up the good Re&s;olution in the Text, that he and his Hou&s;hold would <HI>&s;erve the LORD,</HI> certainly re&s;olved withal to <HI>pray</HI> with his Family, which is one of the be&s;t Te&s;timonies they could give of their &s;erving him.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, there are no Families but what have &s;ome common Ble&s;&s;ings, of which they have been all Partakers, to give Thanks for; &s;ome common Cro&s;&s;es and Afflictions, which they are to pray again&s;t; &s;ome common Sins which they are all to lament and bewail: But how this can be done without joining together in one common Act of Humiliation, Supplication, and Thank&s;giving, is difficult to devi&s;e.</P>
<P>From all which Con&s;iderations put together, it is evident, that <HI>Family Prayer</HI> is a great and nece&s;&s;ary Duty; and con&s;equently, tho&s;e Go|vernors that neglect it are certainly without
<PB N="146" REF="004650_0150_100DDBED50838DE8">
Excu&s;e. And it is much to be feared, if they live without <HI>Family Prayer,</HI> they live without <HI>GOD in the World.</HI></P>
<P>And yet &s;uch an hateful Character as this is, it is to be feared, that was GOD to &s;end out an Angel to de&s;troy us, as he did once to de&s;troy the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Fir&s;t-born, and withal give him a Commi&s;&s;ion, <HI>as then,</HI> to &s;pare no Hou&s;es but where they &s;aw the Blood &s;prinkled on the Lintel and Door-po&s;ts, &s;o <HI>now</HI> to let no Families e&s;cape but tho&s;e that called upon him in Morning and Evening Prayer; few would remain unhurt by his avenging Sword. <HI>Chri|&s;tians</HI> &s;hall I term &s;uch Families, or <HI>Heathens?</HI> Doubtle&s;s they de&s;erve not the Name of <HI>Chri|&s;tians;</HI> and <HI>Heathens</HI> will &s;urely ri&s;e up in Judgment again&s;t &s;uch profane Families of this Generation: For they had always their Hou&s;hold Gods, whom they wor&s;hipped, and who&s;e A&s;&s;i&s;tance they frequently invoked. And a pretty Pa&s;s tho&s;e Families &s;urely are ar|rived at, who mu&s;t be &s;ent to School to <HI>Pagans.</HI> But will not the LORD be avenged on &s;uch profane Hou&s;holds as the&s;e? Will he not pour out his Fury upon tho&s;e that call not upon his Name?</P>
<P N="3">3. But it is Time for me to ha&s;ten to the third and la&s;t Means I &s;hall recommend, where|by every Governor ought with his Hou&s;hold to <HI>&s;erve the LORD, viz.</HI> by <HI>catechizing</HI> and <HI>in&s;tructing</HI> their Children and Servants, and bringing them up in the Nurture and Admonition of the LORD.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="004650_0151_100DDBF2E4688A98">
That this, as well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the two former, is a Duty incumbent on every Governor of an Hou&s;e, appears from that famous Encomium or Com|mendation GOD gives of <HI>Abraham. I know,</HI> &s;ayes the Mo&s;t High, <HI>that He will command his Children and his Hou&s;hold after him to keep the Way of the LORD, to do Ju&s;tice and Judgment.</HI> And indeed &s;carce any Thing is more frequently pre&s;&s;ed upon us in Holy Writ, than this Duty of <HI>Catechizing.</HI> Thus &s;ays God in a Pa&s;&s;age be|fore cited, <HI>Thou &s;halt teach the&s;e Words diligently unto thy Children.</HI> And Parents are commanded in the <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> to <HI>breed up their Children in the Nurture and Admonition of the LORD.</HI> The Holy P&s;almi&s;t acquaints us, that one great End why GOD did &s;o great Wonders for his People was, <HI>to the Intent that when they grew up they &s;hould &s;hew their Children or Servants, the &s;ame.</HI> And in <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> Chap. vi. at the 20th and following Ver&s;es, GOD &s;tricty com|mands his People to in&s;truct their Children in the true Nature of the Ceremonial Wor&s;hip, when they &s;hould enquire about it, as he &s;uppo&s;ed they would do in Time to come. And if Servants and Children were to be in&s;tructed in the Na|ture of <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Rites, much more ought they <HI>now</HI> to be initiated and grounded in the Doctrine and fir&s;t Principles of the Go&s;pel of CHRIST: Not only becau&s;e it is a Revelation which has brought Life and Immortality to a fuller and clearer Light, but al&s;o becau&s;e many Seducers are gone abroad into the World, who do their utmo&s;t En|deavour to de&s;troy not only the Super&s;tructure,
<PB N="148" REF="004650_0152_100DDBF72C7C6D80">
but likewi&s;e to &s;ap the very Foundation of our mo&s;t Holy Religion.</P>
<P>Would then, the pre&s;ent Generation have their Po&s;terity be true Lovers and Honourers of GOD, Ma&s;ters and Parents mu&s;t take <HI>Solomon'</HI>s good Advice, and train up and catechize their re&s;pective Hou&s;holds in the Way wherein they &s;hould go.</P>
<P>I am aware but of one Objection that can, with any Shew of Rea&s;on, be urged again&s;t what has been advanced; which is, That &s;uch a Procedure as this will take up too much Time, and hinder Families too long from their Worldly Bu&s;ine&s;s. But it is much to be que&s;tioned whe|ther Per&s;ons that &s;tart &s;uch an Objection are not of the &s;ame hypocritical Spirit as the Traytor <HI>Judas,</HI> who had Indignation again&s;t devout <HI>Ma|ry,</HI> for being &s;o profu&s;e of her Ointment, in an|ointing our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord, and asked Why it might not be &s;old for Two Hundred Pence, and given to the Poor. For has GOD given us &s;o much Time to work for Our&s;elves, and &s;hall we not allow &s;ome &s;mall Pittance of it, Morning and Evening, to be devoted to his more immediate Wor&s;hip and Service? Have not People read, That it is GOD who gives Men Power to get Wealth, and therefore that the be&s;t Way to pro&s;|per in the World is to &s;ecure His Favour? And has not our ble&s;&s;ed Lord him&s;elf promi&s;ed, That if we &s;eek fir&s;t the Kingdom of God and his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, all outward Nece&s;&s;aries &s;hall be added unto us.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="004650_0153_100DDBF8D01508F0">
<HI>Abraham,</HI> no doubt, was a Man of as great Bu|&s;ine&s;s as &s;uch Objectors may be; but yet he would find Time, to command his Hou&s;hold to <HI>&s;erve the LORD.</HI> Nay, <HI>David,</HI> was a King, and con&s;equently had a great deal of Bu&s;ine&s;s upon his Hands; yet notwith&s;tanding, He profe&s;&s;es that he would walk in his Hou&s;e with a perfect Heart. And, to in&s;tance but one more, Holy <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> was a Per&s;on certainly engaged very much in Temporal Affairs; and yet He &s;olemn|ly declares before all <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> That, as for him and his Hou&s;hold, they would <HI>&s;erve the</HI> LORD. And did Per&s;ons but redeem their Time, as <HI>A|braham, David,</HI> or <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> did, they would no longer complain that Family Duties kept them too long from the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the World.</P>
<P>III. But my <HI>Third</HI> and la&s;t General Head, under which I was to offer &s;ome Motives, in order to excite all Governors with their re&s;pective Hou&s;holds, to <HI>&s;erve the LORD</HI> in the Manner before recommended, I hope, will &s;erve in&s;tead of a Thou&s;and Arguments, to prove the Weakne&s;s and Folly of any &s;uch Objection.</P>
<P N="1">1. And the fir&s;t Motive I &s;hall mention is the Duty of Gratitude, you that are Governors of Families owe to GOD.&mdash;Your Lot, every one mu&s;t confe&s;s, is ca&s;t into a fair Ground: Providence hath given you a goodly Heritage, above many of your Fellow-Creatures, and therefore, out of a Principle of Gratitude, you ought to endeavour, as much as in you lies, to make every Per&s;on of your re&s;pective Hou&s;holds
<PB N="150" REF="004650_0154_100DDBFA785203B8">
to call upon him as long as they live: (Not to mention that the Authority, with which GOD has inve&s;ted you as Parents and Governors of Families, is a Talent committed to your Tru&s;t, and which you are bound to improve to your Ma&s;ter's Honour.) In other Things we find Governors and Parents can exerci&s;e Lord&s;hip over their Children and Servants readily, and frequently enough can &s;ay to one <HI>Go,</HI> and he goeth; and to another <HI>Come,</HI> and he cometh; to a third, <HI>Do this,</HI> and he doeth it. And &s;hall this Power be &s;o often employed in your own Af|fairs, and never exerted in the Things of GOD? Be a&s;toni&s;hed, O Heavens, at this.</P>
<P>Thus did not faithful <HI>Abraham;</HI> No, GOD &s;ays, that He knew <HI>Abraham</HI> would <HI>command his Servants and Children after him.</HI> Thus did not <HI>Jo&s;hua:</HI> No, he was re&s;olved not only to walk with GOD him&s;elf, but to improve his Authority in making all about him do &s;o too: <HI>As for me and my Hou&s;hold we will &s;erve the LORD.</HI> Let us go and do likewi&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. But, Secondly, if <HI>Gratitude</HI> to GOD will not, methinks <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Pity</HI> to your Chil|dren &s;hould move you, with your re&s;pective Families, to <HI>&s;erve the LORD.</HI></P>
<P>Mo&s;t People expre&s;s a great Fondne&s;s for their Children; nay &s;o great, that very often their own Lives are wrapped up in tho&s;e of their Offspring. <HI>Can a Woman forget her &s;ucking Child, that &s;he &s;hould not have Compa&s;&s;ion on the Son of her Womb?</HI> &s;ays GOD by his Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah.</HI> He &s;peaks of it as a mon&s;trous Thing,
<PB N="151" REF="004650_0155_100DDBFE4814D130">
and &s;carce credible. But the Words immedi|ately following affirm it to be po&s;&s;ible, <HI>Yea, They may forget;</HI> and Experience al&s;o a&s;&s;ures us they may. <HI>Father</HI> and <HI>Mother</HI> may both <HI>for&s;ake their Children:</HI> For what greater De|gree of Forgetfulne&s;s can they expre&s;s towards them, than to neglect the Improvement of their better Part, and not bring them up in the Knowledge and Fear of GOD.</P>
<P>It is true, indeed, Parents &s;eldom forget to provide for their Children's Bodies, (though, it is to be feared, &s;ome Men are &s;o far &s;unk be|neath the Bea&s;ts that peri&s;h, as to neglect even that;) but then how often do they forget, or rather when do they remember, to &s;ecure the Salvation of their immortal Souls? But is this their Way of expre&s;&s;ing their Fondne&s;s for the Fruit of their Bodies? Is this the be&s;t Te&s;timo|ny they can give of their Affection to the Dar|ling of their Hearts? Then was <HI>Daltlah</HI> fond of <HI>Samp&s;on,</HI> when &s;he delivered him up into the Hands of the <HI>Phili&s;tines:</HI> Then were tho&s;e Ruf|fians well-affected to <HI>Daniel,</HI> when they threw him into a Den of Lions.</P>
<P N="3">3. But, Thirdly, if neither <HI>Gratitude</HI> to GOD, nor <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Pity</HI> to your Children, will prevail on you; yet let a Principle of common <HI>Hone&s;ty</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> move you to &s;et up the holy Re&s;olu|tion in the Text.</P>
<P>This is a Principle which all Men would be thought to act upon. But certainly, if any may be truly cen&s;ured for their Inju&s;tice, none can be more liable to &s;uch Cen&s;ure than tho&s;e who think
<PB N="152" REF="004650_0156_100DDC010D449F28">
them&s;elves injured if their Servants withdraw them&s;elves from their bodily Work, and yet they in return take no Care of their ine&s;timable Souls. For is it ju&s;t that Servants &s;hould &s;pend their Time and Strength in their Ma&s;ter's Service, and Ma&s;ters not at the &s;ame time give them what is ju&s;t and equal for their Service.</P>
<P>It is true, &s;ome Men may think they have done enough when they give unto their Servants Food and Rayment, and &s;ay, Did not I bargain with thee for &s;o much a Year? But if they give them no other Reward than this, What do they le&s;s for their very Bea&s;ts; But are not Servants better than they? Doubtle&s;s they are: And how|ever Ma&s;ters may put off their Convictions for the pre&s;ent, they will find a Time will come, when they &s;hall know they ought to have given them &s;ome Spiritual, as well as Temporal Wa|ges; and the Cry of tho&s;e that have mowed down their Fields will enter into the Ears of the LORD of <HI>Sabaoth.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. But, Fourthly, If neither <HI>Gratitude</HI> to GOD, <HI>Pity</HI> to Children, nor a Principle of common <HI>Ju&s;|tice</HI> to Servants, are &s;ufficient to balance all Ob|jections; yet let that darling, that prevailing Mo|tive of <HI>Self-Intere&s;t</HI> turn the Scale, and engage you with your re&s;pective Hou&s;holds to <HI>&s;erve the</HI> LORD.</P>
<P>This weighs greatly with you in other Mat|ters: Be then per&s;uaded to let it have a due and full Influence on you in this, and if it has, if you have but Faith as a Grain of Mu&s;tard-Seed, how can you avoid believing that promoting <HI>Family-Religion</HI> would be the be&s;t Means to promote
<PB N="153" REF="004650_0157_100DDC0437F879D8">
your own temporal as well as eternal Welfare? For <HI>Godline&s;s has the Promi&s;e of the Life that now is, as well as that which is to come.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides, you all, doubtle&s;s, wi&s;h for hone&s;t Ser|vants, and pious Children: And to have them prove otherwi&s;e, would be as great a Grief to you as it was to <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI> to have a treacherous <HI>Gehazi,</HI> or <HI>David</HI> to be troubled with a rebellious <HI>Ab&s;alom.</HI> But how can it be expected they &s;hould learn their Duty, except tho&s;e &s;et over them take Care to teach it them? Is it not as rea&s;onable to expect you &s;hould reap where you had not &s;own, or gather where you had not &s;trawed?</P>
<P>Did <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> indeed, give any Countenance to Children and Servants to di&s;regard their <HI>Parents and Ma&s;ters according to the Fle&s;h,</HI> or repre&s;ent their Duty to them as incon&s;i&s;tent with their en|tire Obedience to their <HI>Father and Ma&s;ter which is in Heaven,</HI> there might then be &s;ome Pretence to neglect in&s;tructing them in the Principles of &s;uch a Religion. But &s;ince the Precepts of this pure and undefiled Religion are all of them holy, ju&s;t and good; and the more they are taught their Duty to GOD, the better they will perform their Duties to you; methinks then to neglect the Im|provement of their Souls, out of a dread of &s;pending too much Time in religious Duties, is acting quite contrary to your own Intere&s;t as well as Duty.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Fifthly</HI> and <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> If neither <HI>Gratitude</HI> to GOD, <HI>Love</HI> to your Children, <HI>common Ju&s;tice</HI> to your Servants, nor even that mo&s;t prevailing Mo|tive <HI>Self-Intere&s;t,</HI> will excite; yet let a Con&s;ide|ration of the <HI>Terrors of the Lord</HI> per&s;uade you to
<PB N="154" REF="004650_0158_100DDC05EEA7DCE8">
put in Practice the pious Re&s;olution in the Text. Remember the Time will come, and that perhaps very &s;hortly, when we mu&s;t all appear before the Judgment Seat of CHRIST; where we mu&s;t give a &s;olemn and &s;trict Account how we have had our Conver&s;ation, in our re&s;pective Families in this World. How will you endure to &s;ee your Children and Servants (who ought to be your Joy and Crown of Rejoicing in the Day of our Lord JESUS CHRIST) coming out as &s;o many &s;wift Witne&s;&s;es again&s;t you; cur&s;ing the Father that begot them, the Womb that bare them, the Paps which they have &s;ucked, and the Day they ever entered into your Hou&s;es? Think you not the Damnation which Men mu&s;t endure for their own Sins will be &s;ufficient, that they need load them&s;elves with the additional Guilt of being acce&s;&s;ary to the Damnation of others al&s;o? Oh con&s;ider this, all ye that forget to &s;erve the LORD with your re&s;pective Hou&s;holds, <HI>le&s;t he pluck you away, and there be none to deliver you!</HI></P>
<P>But GOD forbid, Brethren, that any &s;uch Evil &s;hould befal you: No, rather will I hope that you have been in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, convinced by what has been &s;aid of the great Importance of <HI>Family Religion;</HI> and therefore are ready to cry out, in the Words immediately following the Text, <HI>God forbid that we &s;hould for&s;ake the LORD;</HI> and again, Ver&s;e 21, <HI>Nay but we will,</HI> with our &s;everal Hou&s;holds, <HI>&s;erve the LORD.</HI></P>
<P>And that there may be always &s;uch a Heart in you, let me, to conclude, exhort all Governors of Families, in the Name of our Lord JESUS CHRIST,

And though, after all your pious Endeavours, &s;ome may continue unreformed; yet you will have this comfortable Reflection to make, that you did what you could to make your Families <HI>religious:</HI> And therefore may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured of &s;itting down in the Kingdom of Heaven with <HI>Abraham, Jo&s;hua</HI> and <HI>Cornelius,</HI> and all the godly Hou&s;holders, who in their &s;everal Generations &s;hone forth as &s;o many Lights in their re&s;pective Hou&s;holds upon Earth.</P>

<Q><HI>But I &s;ay unto you, Swear not at all.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AMONG the many heinous Sins for which this Nation is grown infamous, perhaps there is no one more crying, but withal more common, than the abominable Cu&s;tom of <HI>profane Swearing and Cur&s;ing.</HI> Our Streets abound with Per&s;ons of all Degrees and Qualities, who are continually provoking the Holy One of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> to Anger, by their dete&s;table Oaths and Bla&s;phemies: And our very Children, <HI>out of who&s;e Mouths,</HI> the P&s;almi&s;t ob&s;erves in his Days, <HI>was perfected Prai&s;e,</HI> are now grown remarkable for the quite oppo&s;ite ill Quality of <HI>Cur&s;ing and Swearing.</HI> This cannot but be a melancholly Pro&s;pect for every &s;incere and hone&s;t Mini&s;ter of JESUS CHRIST, to view his Fellow <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> in; and &s;uch as will put him on contriving &s;ome Means to prevent the &s;preading at lea&s;t of &s;o growing an Evil; knowing that the LORD (without Repentance) will a&s;&s;uredly vi&s;it for the&s;e Things. But alas! what can he do? Public
<PB N="157" REF="004650_0161_100DDC0D1408F3B8">
Animadver&s;ions are &s;o neglected among&s;t us, that where &s;hall we find a common Swearer puni&s;hed as the Laws direct? And as for private Admonition, Men are now &s;o <HI>hardened through the Deceitfulne&s;s of Sin,</HI> that to give them &s;ober and pious Advice, and to &s;hew them the Evil of their Doings, is but like <HI>ca&s;ting Pearls before Swine, they only turn again and rent you.</HI> Since Matters then are come to this Pa&s;s, all that we can do is this, that as we are appointed Watchmen and Amba&s;&s;adors of the LORD, it is our Duty from Time to Time to <HI>&s;hew the People their Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and warn them of their Sin;</HI> &s;o that <HI>whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, we</HI> however <HI>may deliver our own Souls.</HI> That I therefore may di&s;charge my Duty in this Particular, give me Leave, in the Name of GOD, humbly to offer to your mo&s;t &s;erious Con&s;ideration, &s;ome few Ob&s;ervations on the Words of the Text, in order to &s;hew the Heinou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>profane Cur&s;ing and Swearing.</HI></P>
<P>But before I proceed directly to the Pro&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">u|tion of this Point, it will be proper to clear this Precept of our LORD from a Mi&s;interpretation that has been put on it by a Set of Men, who heedle&s;ly infer from hence, that our Saviour prohibits <HI>Swearing</HI> before a Magi&s;trate, when required on a &s;olemn and proper Occa&s;ion. But that all <HI>Swearing</HI> is not ab&s;olutely unlawful for a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> is evident from the Writings of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> whom we often find upon &s;ome &s;olemn Occa&s;ions u&s;ing &s;everal Forms of Imprecation
<PB N="158" REF="004650_0162_100DDC13838E2418">
and Swearing, as, <HI>I call GOD to Witne&s;s,&mdash;GOD is my Judge,&mdash;By your rejoicing in</HI> CHRIST JESUS, and &s;uch like. And that our Saviour does by no Means forbid <HI>Swearing</HI> before a Magi&s;trate, in the Words now before us, is plain, if we con&s;ider the Scope and De&s;ign he had in View, when he gave his Di&s;ciples this Command. Permit me to ob&s;erve to you then, that our Ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter had &s;et him&s;elf, from the 27th Ver&s;e of this Chapter, out of which the Text is taken, to vindicate and clear the Moral Law from the corrupt Glo&s;&s;es and Mi&s;con&s;truction of the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> who then &s;ate in <HI>Mo&s;es'</HI>s Chair, but were notoriou&s;ly faulty in adhering too clo&s;ely to the literal Expre&s;&s;ion of the Law, without ever con&s;idering the due Extent and &s;piritual Meaning of it. Accordingly they imagined, that becau&s;e GOD had &s;aid, <HI>Thou &s;halt not commit Adultery,</HI> that therefore, &s;uppo&s;ing a Per&s;on was not guilty of the very Act of <HI>Adultery,</HI> he was not chargeable with the Breach of the Seventh Commandment. And likewi&s;e in the Matter of <HI>Swearing,</HI> becau&s;e GOD had forbidden his People in the Books of <HI>Exodus</HI> and <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> to take his Name in vain, or to <HI>Swear fal&s;ely</HI> by his Name; they therefore judged it lawful to <HI>Swear</HI> by any Creature in common Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;uppo&s;ing they did not directly mention the Name of GOD. Our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour therefore in the Words now before us, rectifies this their Mi&s;take about <HI>Swearing,</HI> as he had done in the Ver&s;es immediately foregoing that concerning <HI>Adultery,</HI> and tells the People,
<PB N="159" REF="004650_0163_100DDC162454A4D8">
that whatever Allowances the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> might give to <HI>&s;wear</HI> by any Creature, yet he pronoun|ced it ab&s;olutely unlawful for any of his Fol|lowers to do &s;o. <HI>You have heard,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>that it has been &s;aid by them of old Time</HI> (namely by the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> and Teachers of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Law) <HI>Thou &s;halt not for&s;wear thy&s;elf, but perform unto the LORD thine Oaths: But I &s;ay unto you,</HI> (I who am appointed by the Father to be the great Prophet and true Law-giver of his Church) <HI>Swear not at all,</HI> in your common Conver&s;ation <HI>neither by Heaven, for it is GOD's Throne;</HI> and therefore to &s;wear by That, is to &s;wear by Him that &s;its thereon; <HI>neither by the Earth, for it is his Foot-&s;tool; nor by</HI> Jeru&s;alem, <HI>for it is the City of the Great King; neither &s;halt thou &s;wear by thy Head, becau&s;e thou can&s;t not make one Hair white or black: But let your Commu|nications</HI> (which plainly &s;hews that CHRIST is here &s;peaking of <HI>Swearing,</HI> not before a Magi|&s;trate, but in common Conver&s;ation, let your Communications) &s;ays he, <HI>be Yea, yea; Nay, nay,</HI> a &s;trong Affirmation or Negation at the mo&s;t; <HI>for whatever is more than this cometh of Evil;</HI> that is, cometh from an evil Principle, from the Evil One, the Devil, the Author of all Evil.</P>
<P>Which by the Way, methinks, &s;hould be a Caution to all &s;uch Per&s;ons, who, though not guilty of <HI>Swearing</HI> in the gro&s;s Sen&s;e of the Word, yet atte&s;t the Truth of what they are &s;peaking of, though ever &s;o trifling, by &s;aying, <HI>Upon my Life,&mdash;As I live,&mdash;By my Faith,&mdash;By
<PB N="160" REF="004650_0164_100DDC17A9701010">
the Heavens,</HI> and &s;uch like: Which Expre&s;&s;ions, however harmle&s;s and innocent they may be e&s;teemed by &s;ome &s;orts of People, yet are the very Oaths which our Ble&s;&s;ed LORD condemns in the Words immediately following the Text; and Per&s;ons who u&s;e &s;uch unwarrantable Forms of &s;peaking, mu&s;t expect to be convicted and con|demned as <HI>Swearers,</HI> at our Saviour's &s;econd Coming to judge the World.</P>
<P>But to return: It appears then from the whole Tenor of our Saviour's Di&s;cour&s;e, that in the Words of the Text he does by no Means di&s;|annul or forbid <HI>Swearing</HI> before a Magi&s;trate (which, as might ea&s;ily be &s;hewn, is both law|ful and nece&s;&s;ary) but only <HI>profane Swearing</HI> in common Conver&s;ation; the Heinou&s;ne&s;s and Sinfulne&s;s of which I come now, as was above propo&s;ed, more immediately to lay before you.</P>
<P>And here, not to mention that it is a direct Breach of our Ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter's and great Law|giver's Command in the Words of the Text, as likewi&s;e of the T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">rd Commandment, wherein GOD po&s;itively de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">res, he <HI>will not hold him guiltle&s;s</HI> (that is, will a&s;&s;uredly puni&s;h him) <HI>that taketh his Name in vain:</HI> Not to mention that it is the greate&s;t Abu&s;e of that noble Faculty of Speech, whereby we are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the Brute Creation; and the great Hazard the <HI>com|mon Swearer</HI> runs, of being perjured &s;ome Time or other: Not to mention tho&s;e Rea&s;ons again&s;t it, I &s;ay, which of them&s;elves would abundantly prove the Folly and Sinfulne&s;s of <HI>Swearing:</HI>&mdash;
<PB N="161" REF="004650_0165_100DDC1939D87CA8">
I &s;hall, at this Time, content my&s;elf with in&s;tancing in four Particulars, which highly aggravate the Crime of <HI>profane Swearing;</HI> and tho&s;e are &s;uch as follow.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Becau&s;e there is no Temptation in Nature to this Sin, nor does the Com|mi&s;&s;ion of it afford the Offender the lea&s;t Plea&s;ure or Satisfaction.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Becau&s;e it is a Sin which may be &s;o often repeated.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> Becau&s;e it hardens Infidels a|gain&s;t the <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion,</HI> and mu&s;t give great Offence, and occa&s;ion much Sorrow and Concern to every true Di&s;ciple of JESUS CHRIST.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> Becau&s;e it is an Extremity of Sin, which can only be matched in Hell.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>I. The <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> Rea&s;on then, why <HI>Swearing</HI> in common Conver&s;ation is &s;o heinous in GOD's Sight, and why we &s;hould not &s;wear at all, is, becau&s;e it has no Temptation in Nature; nor does the Commi&s;&s;ion of it, unle&s;s a Man be a Devil incarnate, afford the Offender the lea&s;t Plea&s;ure or Satis|faction.</P>
<P>Now here, I pre&s;ume, we may lay it down as a Maxim univer&s;ally agreed on, that the Guilt of any Crime is increa&s;ed or le&s;&s;ened in Proportion to the Weakne&s;s or Strength of the Temptation by which a Per&s;on is carried out to the Commi&s;&s;ion of it. It was this Con&s;ide|ration that extenuated and dimini&s;hed the Guilt
<PB N="162" REF="004650_0166_100DDC1CD65DB540">
of <HI>Saul'</HI>s taking upon him to offer Sacrifice before the Prophet <HI>Samuel</HI> came, and of <HI>Uzza'</HI>s touching the Ark, becau&s;e it was in Danger of falling: As, on the contrary, what &s;o highly aggravated the Di&s;obedience of our fir&s;t Parents and <HI>Lot'</HI>s Wife, was, becau&s;e the former had &s;o little Rea&s;on to eat the forbidden Fruit, and the latter &s;o &s;mall a Temptation to look back on <HI>Sodom.</HI></P>
<P>And now if this be granted, &s;urely the com|mon <HI>Swearer</HI> mu&s;t of all Sinners be the mo&s;t without Excu&s;e, &s;ince there is no Manner of Temptation in Nature to the Commi&s;&s;ion of his Crime. In mo&s;t of the other Commands, Per&s;ons perhaps may plead the Force of Natural Inclination in Excu&s;e for the Breach of them: One, for In&s;tance, may alledge his &s;trong Pro|pen&s;ity to Anger, to excu&s;e his breaking of the Sixth: Another, his Pronene&s;s to Lu&s;t, for his Violation of the Seventh. But now &s;urely the <HI>common Swearer</HI> has nothing of this kind to urge in his Behalf: For though he may have a natural Inclination to this or that Crime, yet no Man, it is to be pre&s;umed, can &s;ay, he is born of a <HI>&s;wearing Con&s;titution.</HI></P>
<P>But farther, as there is no Temptation to it, &s;o there is no Plea&s;ure or Profit to be reaped from the Commi&s;&s;ion of it. Ask the Drunkard why he ri&s;es up early to follow &s;trong Drink, and he will tell you, becau&s;e it affords his &s;en&s;ual Appetite &s;ome kind of Plea&s;ure and Gratification, though it be no higher an one than that of a Brute. Enquire of the covetous Worldling,
<PB N="163" REF="004650_0167_100DDC1F82580578">
why he defrauds and over-reaches his Neighbour, and he has an An&s;wer ready,&mdash;To enrich him|&s;elf, and to lay up Goods for many Years. But it mu&s;t certainly puzzle the <HI>profane Swearer</HI> him&s;elf, to inform you what Plea&s;ure he reaps from <HI>Swearing:</HI> For alas! it is a fruitle&s;s, ta&s;tele&s;s Thing, that he &s;ells his Soul for. But indeed he does not &s;ell it at all: In this Ca&s;e he prodigally gives it away (without Repentance) to the Devil; and parts with a ble&s;&s;ed Eternity, and runs into everla&s;ting Torment, merely for nothing!</P>
<P>II. But <HI>Secondly,</HI> what increa&s;es the Heinou&s;|ne&s;s of <HI>profane Swearing,</HI> is, that it is a Sin which may &s;o often be repeated.</P>
<P>This is another Con&s;ideration which always &s;erves to le&s;&s;en or increa&s;e the Guilt and Malig|nity of any Sin. It was &s;ome Excu&s;e for the Drunkenne&s;s of <HI>Noah,</HI> and the Adultery of <HI>David,</HI> that they committed the&s;e Crimes but once: As, on the contrary, of the Patriarch <HI>Abraham'</HI>s Di&s;tru&s;t of GOD, that he repeated the Di&s;&s;embling of <HI>Sarah</HI> to be his Wife two &s;everal Times. And if this be admitted as an Aggravation of other Per&s;ons Crimes, &s;urely much more &s;o of the Guilt of <HI>common Swearing,</HI> becau&s;e it is a Sin which may be and is for the generality often repeated. In many other gro&s;s Sins it cannot be &s;o: If a Man be overcome in Drink, there mu&s;t be a con&s;iderable Time e'er he can recover his Debauch, and return to his Cups again: Or if he be accu&s;tomed to profane the Sabbath, he cannot do it every Day, but only
<PB N="164" REF="004650_0168_100DDC22483380A8">
one in &s;even. But alas! the <HI>profane Swearer</HI> is ready for another Oath almo&s;t before the Sound of the fir&s;t is out of our Ears: Yea, &s;ome double and treble them in one Sentence, even &s;o as to confound the Sen&s;e of what they &s;ay, by an horrid Din of Bla&s;phemy! Now if the great and terrible <HI>Jehovah</HI> has expre&s;ly declared that he <HI>will not hold him guiltle&s;s,</HI> that is, will a&s;&s;uredly puni&s;h him, <HI>that taketh his Name</HI> but once <HI>in vain:</HI> What a va&s;t Heap of the&s;e heinous Sins lies at every <HI>common Swearer'</HI>s Door! It would be apt to &s;ink him into an intolerable De&s;pair, did he but &s;ee the whole Sum of them. And Oh! what a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eared Con&s;cience mu&s;t that Wretch have, that does not feel this prodigious Weight!</P>
<P>III. But <HI>Thirdly,</HI> what makes the Sin of <HI>pro|fane Swearing</HI> appear yet more exceeding &s;inful, is, that it hardens Infidels again&s;t the <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion.</HI></P>
<P>It is the Apo&s;tle St. <HI>Peter'</HI>s Advice to the married Per&s;ons of his Time, that they &s;hould walk as became the Go&s;pel of CHRIST, that tho&s;e that were without, might be won to em|brace the <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion,</HI> by &s;eeing and ob|&s;erving their pious Conver&s;ation coupled together with Fear. And what the Apo&s;tle pre&s;&s;es on married Per&s;ons we find el&s;ewhere enjoined each particular Member of the Church. Accordingly we are commanded by our Ble&s;&s;ed LORD to <HI>let our Light &s;o &s;hine before Men, that they may &s;ee our good Works, and glorify our Father which is in Heaven:</HI> And the Apo&s;tle St. <HI>Paul</HI> bids us <HI>walk circum&s;pectly towards them that are without,
<PB N="165" REF="004650_0169_100DDC24D300A3A8">
redeeming the Time,</HI> that is embracing all Oppor|tunities to do them good, <HI>becau&s;e the Days are evil.</HI> But alas! in what a direct Contradiction does the <HI>profane Swearer</HI> live to this and &s;uch Precepts, who in&s;tead of gaining Pro&s;elytes to CHRIST from the unbelieving Part of the World, does all he can to oppo&s;e it! For how can it be expected, that Infidels &s;hould honour our GOD, when <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> them&s;elves de&s;pi&s;e him; or that any &s;hould embrace our Religion, when Profe&s;&s;ors of it them&s;elves make &s;o light of one of its &s;tricte&s;t Commands? No, to our Grief and Shame be it &s;poken, it is by rea&s;on of &s;uch Impieties as the&s;e that our <HI>holy Religion</HI> (the be&s;t and pure&s;t in it&s;elf) is become a By word among the Heathen; that the &s;acred Authority of the Holy JESUS and his Doctrine is de&s;pi&s;ed; and <HI>GOD's Name,</HI> as it is written, <HI>bla&s;phemed among the Gentiles.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e cannot but be &s;ad Blocks and Offences in the Way of our Brethren's Conver&s;ion: <HI>But woe be to tho&s;e Men by whom &s;uch Offences come:</HI> We may &s;ay of them, as our ble&s;&s;ed LORD did of <HI>Judas, It had been better for &s;uch Men that they had never been born:</HI> Or, as he threatens in another Place, <HI>It &s;hall be more tolerable for</HI> Sodom <HI>and</HI> Gomorrah <HI>in the Day of Judgment than for &s;uch Sinners.</HI></P>
<P>But this is not all; as <HI>prophane Swearing</HI> mu&s;t undoubtedly harden tho&s;e in their Infidelity that are without, &s;o mu&s;t it no le&s;s grieve and give great Offence to tho&s;e hone&s;t and &s;incere Per&s;ons that are within the Church. We hear of <HI>David'</HI>s complaining and crying out, <HI>Woe is me that I
<PB N="166" REF="004650_0170_100DDC27974FBA48">
am con&s;trained to dwell with Me&s;ech, and to have my Habitation among&s;t the Tents of Kedar:</HI> That is, that he was obliged to live and conver&s;e with a People exceedingly wicked and profane. And St. <HI>Peter</HI> tells us, that <HI>Lot's righteous Soul was grieved day by day, whil&s;t he &s;aw and ob&s;erved the ungodly Conver&s;ation of the Wicked.</HI> And no doubt it was one great Part of our ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter's Sufferings whil&s;t on Earth, that he was com|pelled to conver&s;e with a wicked and perver&s;e Generation, and to hear his heavenly Father's &s;acred Name profaned and &s;coffed at by unrigh|teous and wicked Men. And &s;urely it cannot but pierce the Heart of every true and &s;incere <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> of every one that does in any Mea&s;ure partake of the Spirit of his Ma&s;ter, to hear the Multitude of Oaths and Cur&s;es which proceed daily and hourly out of the Mouths of many People, and tho&s;e too who&s;e liberal Education and &s;eeming Regard for the Welfare of Religion, one would think, &s;hould teach them a more be|coming Behaviour. To hear the great and terrible Name of GOD polluted by Men, which is adored by Angels; and to con&s;ider how often that &s;acred Name is profaned in common Di&s;cour&s;e, which we are not worthy to mention in our Prayers: This, I &s;ay, cannot but make each of them cry out with holy <HI>David, Woe is me that I am con|&s;trained to dwell with Me&s;ech, and to have my Ha|bitation among&s;t the Tents of Kedar.</HI> And though the bla&s;phemous and profane Di&s;cour&s;es of others will not be imputed to &s;incere Per&s;ons for Sin, &s;o long as they <HI>have no Fellow&s;hip with &s;uch helli&s;h
<PB N="167" REF="004650_0171_100DDC2A153A9200">
Fruits of Darkne&s;s, but rather reprove them;</HI> nay, rather will be imputed to them for Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, for thus lamenting the Wickedne&s;s of <HI>Sion:</HI> yet it will greatly enhance the pre&s;ent Guilt, and &s;adly increa&s;e the future Puni&s;hment of every <HI>profane Swearer,</HI> by whom &s;uch Offences come. For if, as our Saviour tells us, <HI>it had been better for a Man to have a Mill-&s;tone tied about his Neck, than that he &s;hould offend one of his little ones,</HI> that is, the weake&s;t of his Di&s;ciples, <HI>how much &s;orer Puni&s;hment will they be thought worthy of,</HI> who not only cau&s;e GOD's Name to be bla&s;phemed among the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and the Religion of our dear Redeemer to be abhorred; but who make his Saints to weep and mourn, and <HI>vex their righteous Souls from day to day,</HI> by their ungodly, profane and bla&s;phemous Conver&s;ation? Surely as GOD will put the Tears of <HI>one</HI> into his Bottle, and recompen&s;e them with eternal Glory at the great Day of Retribution, &s;o it will be ju&s;t in him to puni&s;h the <HI>other</HI> with eternal Sorrow for all their ungodly and hard Speeches, and ca&s;t them into a Lake of Fire and Brim&s;tone, where they &s;hall be glad of a Drop of Water to cool tho&s;e Tongues with which they have &s;o often bla&s;phemed the LORD of Ho&s;ts, and grieved the People of our GOD.</P>
<P>IV. But it is Time for me to proceed to give my <HI>Fourth</HI> and la&s;t Rea&s;on, why <HI>common Swearing</HI> is &s;o exceeding &s;inful. And that is, becau&s;e it is &s;uch an Extremity of Sin, that can only be matched in Hell, where all are de&s;perate, and without Hope of Mercy.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="004650_0172_100DDC2CCE849550">
The damned Devils and damned Souls of Men in Hell, may be &s;uppo&s;ed to rave and bla&s;|pheme in their Torments, becau&s;e they know that the Chains wherein they are held can never be knocked off: But for Men that &s;wim in the River of GOD's Goodne&s;s, <HI>who&s;e Mercies are renewed to them every Morning,</HI> and who are vi&s;ited with fre&s;h Tokens of his infinite unme|rited Loving-kindne&s;s every Moment: For the&s;e favourite Creatures to <HI>&s;et their Mouths again&s;t Heaven,</HI> and to bla&s;pheme a gracious, patient, all-bountiful GOD &punc; is a Height of Sin which exceeds the Blackne&s;s and Impiety of Devils and Hell it&s;elf.</P>
<P>And now, after what has been here offered, to &s;hew the Heinou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>profane Cur&s;ing</HI> and <HI>Swearing</HI> in common Conver&s;ation, may I not very ju&s;tly addre&s;s my&s;elf to you in the Words of the Text, <HI>Therefore I &s;ay unto you, &s;wear not at all;</HI> &s;ince it is a Sin that has no Temptation in Nature, nor brings any Plea&s;ure or Profit to the Committer of it; &s;ince it hardens Infidels in their Infidelity, and affords &s;ad Cau&s;es of Grief and Lamentation to every hone&s;t <HI>Chri&s;tian;</HI> &s;ince it is a Sin that generally grows into a Habit; and la&s;tly, &s;uch a Sin that can only be matched in Hell.</P>
<P N="1">1. And fir&s;t then, if the&s;e Things be &s;o, and the Sin of <HI>profane Swearing,</HI> as hath been in &s;ome Mea&s;ure &s;hewn, is &s;o exceeding &s;inful, what &s;hall we &s;ay to &s;uch unhappy Men, who think it not only allowable, but fa&s;hionable and polite, to <HI>take the Name of GOD in vain;</HI> who imagine

that <HI>Swearing</HI> makes them look big among their Companions, and really think it a Piece of Hon|our to abound in it? But alas! little do they think that &s;uch a Behaviour argues the greate&s;t Degeneracy of Mind and Fool-hardine&s;s that can po&s;&s;ibly be thought of: For what can be more ba&s;e than one Hour to pretend to adore GOD in publick Wor&s;hip, and the very next Moment to bla&s;pheme his Name: Indeed &s;uch a Behaviour from Per&s;ons who deny the Being of a GOD (if any &s;uch Fools there be) is not altogether &s;o much to be wondered at: But for Men, who not only &s;ub&s;cribe to the Belief of a Deity, but likewi&s;e acknowledge him to be a GOD of infinite Maje&s;ty and Power; for &s;uch Men, I &s;ay, to bla&s;pheme his holy Name by <HI>profane Cur&s;ing</HI> and <HI>Swearing,</HI> and at the &s;ame Time confe&s;s, that this very GOD has expre&s;sly declared He <HI>will not hold him guiltle&s;s,</HI> that is, will certainly and eternally puni&s;h (without Repentance) him <HI>that taketh his Name in vain;</HI> is &s;uch an In&s;tance of Fool-hardi|ne&s;s as well as Ba&s;ene&s;s, that can &s;carcely be parallel'd. This is what they pre&s;ume not to do in other Ca&s;es of le&s;s Danger: They dare not revile a General at the Head of his Army, nor rou&s;e a &s;leeping Lion when within reach of his Paw. And is the Almighty GOD, the Great <HI>JEHOVAH,</HI> the Everla&s;ting King, who can con&s;ume them by the Breath of his No&s;trils, and frown them to Hell in an In&s;tant; is He, I &s;ay, the only contemptible Being in their Account that may be provoked without Fear, and offended without Puni&s;hment? No, though GOD bear

long, he will not bear always: Time will come, and that too perhaps much &s;ooner than &s;uch Per|&s;ons may expect, when GOD will vindicate his injured Honour, when he will lay bare his Al|mighty Arm, and make tho&s;e Wretches feel the eternal Smart of his Ju&s;tice, who&s;e Power and Name they have &s;o often vilified and bla&s;phemed. Alas! what will become of all their Bravery then? Will they then wantonly &s;port with the Name of their Maker, and call upon the King of all the Earth to damn them any more in Je&s;t? No, their Note will then be changed; indeed they &s;hall call, but, alas! it will be for <HI>the Rocks to fall on them, and the Hills to cover them from the Wrath of him that &s;itteth upon the Throne, and from the Lamb forever.</HI> It is true, Time was when they prayed, though without Thought perhaps, for Damnation both for them&s;elves and others: And now they will find their Pray|ers an&s;wered.&mdash;<HI>They delighted in Cur&s;ing, there|fore &s;hall it happen unto them; they loved not Ble&s;&s;ing, therefore &s;hall it be far from them; they cloathed them&s;elves with Cur&s;ing like as with a Garment, and it &s;hall come into their Bowels like Water, and like Oil into their Bones.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. But farther, if the Sin of <HI>Swearing</HI> is &s;o exceeding heinous and withal &s;o common, then it is every particular Per&s;on's Duty, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that are in Authority, to do their utmo&s;t towards di&s;countenancing and &s;uppre&s;&s;ing &s;o ma|lignant a Crime.

Were we to hear either our own or our Friend's good Name vilified and tra|duced, we &s;hould think it our bounden Duty to vindicate the wronged Reputation of each: And &s;hall the great, terrible and holy Name of our be&s;t and only Friend, our King, our Father, nay our GOD: Shall this, I &s;ay, be daily, nay every Moment defied and bla&s;phemed; and will no one dare to &s;tand up in Defence of his Honour and Holine&s;s? <HI>Be a&s;toni&s;hed, O Heavens,</HI> at this! No, let us &s;corn all &s;uch ba&s;e and treacherous Treatment: Let us, for once at lea&s;t, re&s;olve to &s;upport the Cau&s;e of Religion, and with a becoming prudent Courage manife&s;t our Zeal for the Honour of the LORD of Ho&s;ts. Men in Authority have dou|ble the Advantages of ordinary <HI>Chri&s;tians:</HI> Their very Office &s;hews they are intended for the Pun|i&s;hment of Evil Doers: And &s;uch is the Degene|racy of Mankind, that the generality of them will be more influenced by the Power of Per&s;ons in Authority, than by the mo&s;t laboured Exhor|tations from the Pulpit. To &s;uch therefore&punc; if there are any here pre&s;ent, I humbly addre&s;s my|&s;elf, be&s;eeching them in the Name of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, to do their utmo&s;t to put a &s;top to, and re&s;train <HI>profane Cur&s;ing</HI> and <HI>Swearing.</HI> And though it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that this is a Work which requires a great deal of Courage

<HEAD>SERMON X. Thankfulne&s;s for Mercies received a Nece&s;&s;ary DUTY.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>PSALM cvii. 30, 31.</BIBL>
<Q><L><HI>Then are they glad, becau&s;e they are at Re&s;t, and &s;o he bringeth them unto the Haven where they would be.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Oh that Men would therefore Prai&s;e the LORD for his Goodne&s;s, and declare the Wonders that he doth for the Children of Men!</HI></L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>NUMBERLESS Marks does Man bear in his Soul, that he is fallen and e&s;tranged from GOD; but no one gives a greater Proof of it, than that Backwardne&s;s, which every one finds within him&s;elf, to the Duty of Prai&s;e and Thank&s;giving.</P>
<P>When GOD placed the fir&s;t Man in Paradi&s;e, his Soul, no doubt, was &s;o filled with a Sen&s;e of the Riches of the Divine Love, that he was continually employing that <HI>Breath of Life</HI> the Almighty had not long before <HI>breathed</HI> into him, in ble&s;&s;ing and magnifying that all-bountiful, all-gracious GOD, in whom he lived, moved, and had his Being.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="004650_0178_100DDC3C593CFFA0">
And the brighte&s;t Idea we can form of the Angelical Hierarchy above, and the Spirits of ju&s;t Men made perfect, is, that they are continually &s;tanding round the Throne of GOD, and cea&s;e not Day and Night, &s;aying, <HI>Worthy art thou, O Lamb, that was &s;lain, to receive Power, and Riches, and Wi&s;dom, and Strength, and Honour, and Glory, and Ble&s;&s;ing,</HI> Rev. v. 12.</P>
<P>That then, which was Man's Perfection when Time fir&s;t began, and will be his Employment when Death is &s;wallowed up in Victory, and Time &s;hall be no more, without Controver&s;y, is part of our Perfection, and ought to be our frequent Exerci&s;e on Earth: And I doubt not but tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed Spirits, who are &s;ent forth to mini&s;ter to them who &s;hall be Heirs of Salvation, often &s;tand a&s;toni&s;hed when they encamp around us, to find our Hearts &s;o rarely enlarged, and our Mouths &s;o &s;eldom opened, to &s;hew forth the loving Kindne&s;s of the LORD, or to &s;peak of all his Prai&s;e.</P>
<P>Matter for Prai&s;e and Adoration can never be wanting to Creatures redeemed by the Blood of the Son of GOD; and who have &s;uch continual Scenes of his infinite Goodne&s;s pre&s;ented to their View, that were their Souls duly affected with a Sen&s;e of his univer&s;al Love, they could not but be continually calling on Heaven and Earth, Men and Angels, to join with them in prai&s;ing and ble&s;&s;ing that HIGH <HI>and</HI> LOFTY ONE, <HI>who inha|biteth Eternity, who maketh his Sun to &s;hine on the Evil and on the Good, and daily pours down his Ble&s;&s;ing on the whole Race of Mankind.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="004650_0179_100DDC4182D39648">
But few are arrived to &s;uch a Degree of Charity, as to rejoice with tho&s;e that do rejoice, and to be as thankful for others Mercies as their own. This Part of Chri&s;tian Perfection, though begun on Earth, will be con&s;ummated only in Heaven; where our Hearts will glow with &s;uch fervent Love towards GOD and one another, that every fre&s;h degree of Glory communicated to our Neighbour, will al&s;o communicate to us a fre&s;h degree of Thankfulne&s;s and Joy.</P>
<P>That which has a greater Tendency to excite the Generality of us fallen Men to Prai&s;e and Thank&s;giving, is a Sen&s;e of GOD's private Mercies and particular Benefits be&s;towed upon our&s;elves. For as the&s;e come nearer our own Hearts, &s;o they mu&s;t be more affecting; and as they are peculiar Proofs, whereby we may know that GOD does in a more e&s;pecial Manner favour us above others, &s;o they cannot but &s;en&s;ibly touch us; and if our Hearts are not quite frozen, like Coals of a Refiner's Fire, mu&s;t melt us down into Thankfulne&s;s and Love. It was a Con&s;ideration of the di&s;tingui&s;hing Favours GOD had &s;hewn to his cho&s;en People <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and the frequent and remarkable Deliverances wrought by him in Behalf of <HI>tho&s;e who go down to the Sea in Ships, and occupy their Bu&s;ine&s;s in great Waters,</HI> that made the holy P&s;almi&s;t break out &s;o frequently as he does in this P&s;alm, into this moving, pathetical Exclamation, <HI>O that Men would therefore prai&s;e the LORD for his Goodne&s;s, and declare the Wonders that he doeth for the Children of Men!</HI></P>

His expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf in &s;o pa&s;&s;ionate, fervent a Manner, implies both the Importance and Neglect of the Duty. As when <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> or another Occa&s;ion cries out, <HI>Oh that they were wi&s;e, that they under&s;tood this, that they woull</HI> practically <HI>con&s;ider their latter End?</HI> Deut xxxii. 29.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, Importance and Neglect of the Duty for out of tho&s;e many Thou&s;ands that receive Ble&s;&s;ings from the LORD, how few give Thanks in Remembrance of his Holine&s;s? The Account given us of the ungrateful Lepers, is but too lively a Repre&s;entation of the Ingratitude of Mankind in general; who like them, perhaps, when under any humbling Providence, can cry, JESUS <HI>Ma&s;ter, have Mercy on us,</HI> Luke xvii. 13. but when healed of their Sickne&s;s, or delivered from their Di&s;tre&s;s, &s;carce one in ten can be <HI>found returning to give Thanks to GOD.</HI></P>
<P>And yet as common as this Sin of Ingratitude is, there is nothing we ought more earne&s;tly to pray again&s;t. For what is more ab&s;olutely condemned in Holy Scripture than Ingratitude? Or what more peremptorily required than the contrary Temper? Thus &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, <HI>Rejoyce evermore, in every Thing give Thanks,</HI> 1 Thef. v. 16&mdash;18. <HI>Be careful for nothing: But in every Thing by Prayer and Supplication, with Thank&s;giving, let your Reque&s;ts be made known unto GOD,</HI> Phil. iv. 6.</P>
<P>On the contrary, the Apo&s;tle mentions it as one of the highe&s;t Crimes of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> that they were not <HI>thankful. Neither were they
<PB N="177" REF="004650_0181_100DDC461EC647D8">
thankful,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>Romans</HI> i. 21. As al&s;o in another Place, he numbers the <HI>Unthankful,</HI> 2 Tim. iii. 2. among&s;t tho&s;e <HI>unholy,</HI> profane Per&s;ons who are to have their Portion in the Lake of Fire and Brim&s;tone.</P>
<P>As for our Sins, GOD puts them behind his Back; but his Mercies he will have acknow|ledged. There <HI>is Vertue gone out of me,</HI> &s;ays JESUS CHRIST, Luke viii.46. And the Woman who was cured of her bloody I&s;&s;ue, mu&s;t <HI>confe&s;s</HI> it: And we generally find, when GOD &s;ent any remarkable Puni&s;hment upon any particular Per&s;on, he reminded him of the Favours he had received, as &s;o many Aggravations of his Ingra|titude. Thus when GOD was about to vi&s;it <HI>Eli's</HI> Hou&s;e, he thus expo&s;tulates with him by his Prophet, <HI>Did I plainly appear unto the Hou&s;e of thy Fathers, when they were in</HI> Egypt, <HI>in</HI> Pharaoh's <HI>Hou&s;e? And did I chu&s;e him out of all the Tribes of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>to be my Prie&s;t, to offer upon my Altar, to burn Incen&s;e, and to wear an Ephod before me? Wherefore kick ye at my Sacrifice, and at mine Offering which I have commanded in my Habitation, and honoure&s;t thy Sons above me, to make your&s;elves fat with the chiefe&s;t of all the Offerings of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>my People? Wherefore the LORD GOD of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>&s;aith, I &s;aid indeed, that thy Hou&s;e, and the Hou&s;e of thy Father &s;hould walk before me for ever; but now the LORD &s;aith, Be it far from me, for them that honour me will I honour, and they that de&s;pi&s;e me, &s;hall be lightly e&s;teemed.</HI> I Sam. ii. 27, 28, 29, 30.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="004650_0182_100DDC48381CB730">
It was this and &s;uch like In&s;tances of GOD's Severity again&s;t the Unthankful, that inclined me to chu&s;e the Words of the Text as the mo&s;t proper Subject I could di&s;cour&s;e on at this Time.</P>
<P>For the&s;e four Months, my good Friends, we have now been upon the Sea in this Ship, and have <HI>occupied our Bu&s;ine&s;s in the great Waters.</HI> At GOD Almighty's <HI>Word,</HI> we have &s;een the <HI>&s;tormy Wind ari&s;e, which hath lifted up the Waves thereof. We have been carried up to the Heaven and down again to the Deep, and &s;ome of our Souls melted away, becau&s;e of the Trouble; but I tru&s;t we cried earne&s;tly unto the LORD, and he delivered us out of our Di&s;tre&s;s. For he made the Storm to cea&s;e; &s;o that the Waves thereof were &s;till. And now we are glad becau&s;e we are at Re&s;t, for GOD hath brought us to the Haven where we would be Oh that you would therefore prai&s;e the LORD for his Goodne&s;s, and declare the Wonders that</HI> he hath <HI>done for</HI> us, the unworthie&s;t of the Sons <HI>of Men.</HI></P>
<P>Thus <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> thus <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> behaved. For when they were about to take their Leaves of the Children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> they recounted to them what great Things GOD had done for them, as the be&s;t Arguments and Motives they could urge to engage them to Obedience. And how can I copy after better Examples? What fitter, what more noble Motives to Holine&s;s and Purity of Living can I lay before you than they did?</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="004650_0183_100DDC4C1176B400">
Indeed I cannot &s;ay, that we have &s;een <HI>a Pillar of a Cloud by Day,</HI> or <HI>a Pillar of Fire by Night,</HI> going vi&s;ibly before us to guide our Cour&s;e; but this I can &s;ay, that the &s;ame GOD who was in that Pillar of a Cloud, and Pillar of Fire, which departed not from the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> and who has made the Sun to rule the Day, and the Moon to rule the Night, has by his good Providence directed us in our right Way, or el&s;e the Pilot had &s;teered us in vain.</P>
<P>Neither can I &s;ay, that we have &s;een the <HI>Sun &s;tand &s;till,</HI> as the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> did in the Days of <HI>Jo&s;hua.</HI> But &s;urely GOD, during part of our Voyage, has cau&s;ed it to with-hold &s;ome of that Heat which it u&s;ually &s;ends forth in the&s;e warmer Climates, or el&s;e it had not failed but &s;ome of you mu&s;t have peri&s;hed in the Sickne&s;s that has been, and does yet continue among us.</P>

<P>We may indeed, Athei&s;t like, a&s;cribe all the&s;e Things to natural Cau&s;es, and &s;ay, our own Skill and Fore&s;ight has brought us hither in

<P>It is he, my Brethren, and not we our&s;elves, that has of late &s;ent us &s;uch pro&s;perous Gales, and made us ride, as it were on the Wings of the Wind, into the Haven where we would be.</P>
<P><HI>O that you would therefore prai&s;e the LORD for his Goodne&s;s,</HI> and by your Lives declare, that you are truly thankful for the Wonders he hath &s;hewn to us, who are le&s;s than the lea&s;t of the Sons of Men.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, declare it by your Lives. For to give him Thanks barely with your Lips, while your Hearts are far from him, is but a mock Sacrifice, nay, an Abomination unto the LORD.</P>
<P>This was the End, the Royal P&s;almi&s;t &s;ays, GOD had in view, when he &s;hewed &s;uch Wonders

<P>If they have not this Effect upon us, we &s;hall of all Men be mo&s;t mi&s;erable; for GOD is ju&s;t, as well as merciful; and the more Ble&s;&s;ings we have received here, the greater Damnation, if we do not improve them, &s;hall we incur hereafter.</P>

<P>Con&s;ider, my good Friends, you are now, as it were, entring on a new World, where you will be &s;urrounded with Multitudes of Heathens; and if you take not heed to <HI>have your Conver|&s;ation hone&s;t among&s;t them, and to walk worthy the Holy Vocation wherewith you are called,</HI> you will act the Helli&s;h Part of <HI>Herod's</HI> Soldiers over again; and cau&s;e CHRIST's Religion, as they did his Per&s;on, to be had in Deri&s;ion of tho&s;e that are round about you.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider farther, what peculiar Privileges you have enjoyed above many others that are entring on the &s;ame Land. They have had, as it were a Famine of the Word, but you have rather been in Danger of being &s;urfeited with your Spiritual <HI>Manna.</HI> And therefore, as more In&s;tructions have been given you, &s;o from you

<P>Indeed I cannot &s;ay I have di&s;charged my Duty towards you as I ought. No, I am &s;en&s;ible of many Faults which I have been guilty of in my mini&s;terial Office, and for which I have not failed, nor, I hope, ever &s;hall fail to humble my&s;elf in &s;ecret before GOD. How|ever, this I can &s;ay, that except a few Days that have been &s;pent nece&s;&s;arily on other Per|&s;ons, whom GOD immediately called me to write and mini&s;ter unto, and the two la&s;t Weeks wherein I have been confined by Sickne&s;s, all the while I have been aboard, I have been either actually engaged in, or preparing my&s;elf for in&s;tructing you.

<Q><HI>The&s;e &s;hall go away into Everla&s;ting Puni&s;hment.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Excellency of the Go&s;pel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">pen&s;ation is evidenced by nothing more, than tho&s;e Sanctions of Rewards and Puni&s;hments, which it offers to the Choice of all its Profe&s;&s;ors, in order to invite or compel them to be obedient to its Precepts.&mdash;For it promi&s;es no le&s;s than Eternal Happine&s;s to the Good, and denounces no &s;lighter a Puni&s;hment than Everla&s;ting Mi&s;ery again&s;t the Wicked. On the one Hand, <HI>it is a Savour of Life unto Life,</HI> on the other, <HI>a Savour of Death unto Death.</HI> And though one would imagine the bare mentioning of the former would be &s;ufficient to draw Men to their Duty, yet Mini&s;ters in all Ages have found it nece&s;|&s;ary frequently to remind their People of the latter, and to &s;et before them the Terrors of the LORD, as &s;o many powerful Di&s;&s;ua&s;ives from Sin.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="004650_0198_100DDC757A115370">
But whence is it that Men are &s;o di&s;inge|nuous?&mdash;Why, the Rea&s;on &s;eems to be this.&mdash;The Promi&s;e of Eternal Happine&s;s on our Well-doing, is &s;o agreeable to the Inclinations and Wi&s;hes of Mankind, that all that call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, univer&s;ally and willingly &s;ub&s;cribe to the Belief of it. But then there is &s;omething &s;o &s;hocking in the Con&s;ideration of Eternal <HI>Torments,</HI> and &s;eemingly &s;uch an infinite Di&s;proportion be|tween an endle&s;s Duration of Pain, and a &s;hort Life &s;pent in Plea&s;ure, that Men (&s;ome at lea&s;t of them) can &s;carcely be brought to confe&s;s it as an Article of their Faith, that an Eternity of Mi&s;ery awaits the Wicked in a future State.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore at this Time beg Leave, to in&s;i&s;t on the Proof of this Part of one of the Articles of our Creed; and endeavour <HI>to make good</HI> what our ble&s;&s;ed LORD has here threatned in the Words of the Text, that <HI>The&s;e,</HI> that is, the <HI>Wicked, &s;hall go away into Everla&s;ting Puni&s;hment.</HI></P>
<P>Accordingly, without con&s;idering the Words as they &s;tand in Relation to the Context, I &s;hall re&s;olve all I have to &s;ay into this one general Propo&s;ition,&mdash;<Q>That the Torments re&s;erved for the Wicked hereafter are eternal.</Q></P>
<P>But before I proceed to make good this, I mu&s;t inform you that I take it for granted,</P>
<P>All here pre&s;ent &s;tedfa&s;tly believe, <Q>They have &s;omething within them, which we call a Soul, and which is capable of &s;urviving the Di&s;&s;olution of the Body, and of being mi&s;erable or happy to all Eternity.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="004650_0199_100DDC780CDEFF88">
I take it for granted farther, <Q>That you believe a Divine Revelation; that tho&s;e Books, emphatically called <HI>the Scriptures,</HI> were written by the In&s;piration of GOD, and that the Things therein contained, are founded upon Eternal Truth.</Q></P>
<P>I take it for granted la&s;tly, <Q>That you believe, that the Son of GOD came down to die for Sinners; that there is but one Mediator between GOD and Man, even the Man CHRIST JESUS.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e Things being granted (and they were nece&s;&s;ary to be premi&s;ed) proceed we now <HI>to make good</HI> the one general Propo&s;ition men|tioned before, and a&s;&s;erted in the Text, that <Q>The Torments re&s;erved for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> here|after are Eternal.</Q>&mdash;<HI>The&s;e,</HI> &s;ays <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> LORD, <HI>&s;hall go away into Everla&s;ting Pu|ni&s;hment.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t Argument I &s;hall advance to prove that the Torments re&s;erved for the Wicked here|after are eternal (for I have taken it for granted, that you believe tho&s;e Books, emphatically called <HI>the Scriptures,</HI> were written by the In&s;piration of GOD, and that the Things contained therein are founded upon Eternal Truth) is, That the Word of GOD him&s;elf, a&s;&s;ures us, Line upon Line, that it will be &s;o.</P>
<P>To quote all the Texts that might be pro|duced in Proof of this, would be endle&s;s,&mdash;Let it &s;uffice to in&s;tance only in a few.&mdash;In the <HI>Old Te&s;tament,</HI> in the Book of <HI>Daniel,</HI> Chap. xii. ver. 2. we are told, that <HI>Some &s;hall awake
<PB N="196" REF="004650_0200_100DDC7B27A805F8">
to Everla&s;ting Life, and others to Everla&s;ting Contempt.</HI>&mdash;In the Book of <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> it is &s;aid, that <HI>The Worm of tho&s;e that have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed GOD's Law, &s;hall not die, nor their Fire be quenched.</HI>&mdash;And in another Place, the Holy Prophet, &s;truck, no doubt, with A&s;toni&s;hment and Horror at the Pro&s;pect of the Continuance of the Torments of the Damned, breaks out into this moving Expo&s;tulation, <HI>Who can dwell with Everla&s;ting Burnings?</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> is &s;till fuller as to this Point, it being a Revelation which brought this and &s;uch-like Particulars to a clear Light.&mdash;The Apo&s;tle <HI>Jude</HI> tells us of the profane De&s;pi&s;ers of Dignities in his Days, that <HI>for them was re|&s;erved the Blackne&s;s of Darkne&s;s for ever.</HI>&mdash;And in the Book of the <HI>Revelations</HI> it is written, that <HI>The Smoke of the Torments of the Wicked a&s;cendeth for ever and ever</HI>&mdash;And if we believe the Witne&s;s of Men in&s;pired, the Witne&s;s of the Son of GOD, who had the Spirit given him, as he was a Mediator, without Mea&s;ure, is &s;till far greater.&mdash;And he, in St. <HI>Mark's</HI> Go&s;pel, re|peats this &s;olemn Declaration three &s;everal Times. <HI>It is better for Thee to enter into Life maimed;</HI> that is, it is better to forego the Gratification of thy Lu&s;t, or incur the Di&s;plea&s;ure of a Friend, which may be as dear to thee as a Hand, or as u&s;eful as a Foot, <HI>than having two Hands and Feet,</HI> that is, for indulging the one, or di&s;obeying GOD to oblige the other, <HI>to be ca&s;t into Hell, where the Worm dieth not, and the Fire is not quenched.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="004650_0201_100DDD691CB672D8">
And here again, in the Words of the Text, <HI>The&s;e,</HI> that is, the Wicked, &s;ays he, <HI>&s;hall go away into everla&s;ting Puni&s;hment.</HI></P>
<P>I know it has been objected by &s;ome who have denied the Eternity of Hell Torments, <Q>That the Words <HI>Everla&s;ting</HI> and <HI>Ever and Ever,</HI> are often u&s;ed in the Holy Scriptures, (e&s;pecially in the <HI>Old Te&s;tament</HI>) when they &s;ignify not an endle&s;s Duration, but a limited Term of Time.</Q></P>
<P>And this we readily grant. But then we re|ply, <Q>That when the Words are u&s;ed with this Limitation, they either manife&s;tly appear to be u&s;ed &s;o from the Context</Q>&mdash;or are put in Oppo&s;ition to &s;ome occa&s;ional Types which <HI>GOD</HI> gave his People on &s;ome &s;pecial Occa&s;ions, as when it is &s;aid, <HI>it &s;hall be a perpetual or ever|la&s;ting Statute,</HI> or <HI>a Statute for ever,</HI> that is, a &s;tanding Type, and not merely tran&s;ient or oc|ca&s;ional, as was the <HI>Pillar of Cloud,</HI> the <HI>Manna,</HI> or &s;uch like&mdash;Or la&s;tly, they have a Relation, to that Covenant GOD made with his &s;piritual <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> which, if under&s;tood in a &s;piritual Sen&s;e, will be everla&s;ting, though the Ceremonial Di&s;|pen&s;ation be aboli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, it ought to be ob&s;erved, that, &s;ome of the Pa&s;&s;ages ju&s;t now referred to, have neither of the&s;e Words &s;o much as mentioned in them, and cannot po&s;&s;ibly be interpreted &s;o as to de|note only a limited Term of Years.</P>
<P>But let that be as it will, it is evident even to a D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">on&s;tration, that the Words of the Text however, will not admit of &s;uch a re&s;trained
<PB N="198" REF="004650_0202_100DD79B133A5D00">
Signification, as appears from their being direct|ly oppo&s;ed to the Words immediately following, <HI>viz.  That the Righteous &s;hall go into Life eternal.</HI> From which Words, all are ready to grant, that the Life promi&s;ed to the Righteous will be Eter|nal; and why the Puni&s;hment threatned to the Wicked &s;hould not be under&s;tood to be E|ternal likewi&s;e, when the very &s;ame Word in the Original, is u&s;ed to expre&s;s the Du|ration of each, no Shadow of a Rea&s;on can be given.</P>
<P>But <HI>Secondly,</HI> There cannot be one Argu|ment urged, why GOD &s;hould reward his Saints with everla&s;ting Happine&s;s, which will not equally prove that he ought to puni&s;h Sin|ners with Eternal Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>For, &s;ince we know nothing (at lea&s;t for a Certainty) how he will deal with either, but by a Divine Revelation; and &s;ince, as was proved by the foregoing Argument, he hath as po&s;itively threatned eternally to puni&s;h the Wicked, as to reward the Good; it follows that his Truth will be as much impeached and called in Que&s;tion, did he not inflict his Puni&s;h|ments, as it would be, if he did not confer his Rewards.</P>
<P>To this al&s;o it has been objected, <Q>That though GOD is obliged by his Promi&s;e to give his Rewards, yet his Veracity could not be called in Que&s;tion, &s;uppo&s;ing he &s;hould not execute his Threatnings, as he actually did not in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Nineveh,</HI> which GOD ex|pre&s;ly declared by his Prophet <HI>Jonah, &s;hould
<PB N="199" REF="004650_0203_100DD79D83644558">
be de&s;troyed in Forty Days;</HI> notwith&s;tanding the Sequel of the Story informs us, that <HI>Ni|neveh</HI> was &s;pared.</Q></P>
<P>But in an&s;wer to this Objection we affirm, <Q>That GOD's Threatnings, as well as Pro|mi&s;es, are without Repentance.</Q>&mdash;And for this Rea&s;on, becau&s;e they are both founded on the eternal Laws of right Rea&s;on.&mdash;According|ly we always find, that where the Conditions were not performed, on the Non-performance of which the Threatnings were denounced, GOD always executed the Puni&s;hment threatned.&mdash;The driving <HI>Adam</HI> out of <HI>Eden,</HI>&mdash;The De&s;truc|tion of the old World by a Deluge of Water, and the Overthrow of <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> are, and will be always &s;o many &s;tanding Mo|numents of GOD's executing his Threatnings when denounced, though, to our weak Appre|hen&s;ions, the Puni&s;hment may &s;eem far to exceed the Crime.</P>
<P>It is true, GOD did &s;pare <HI>Nineveh,</HI> and that becau&s;e the Inhabitants did actually repent, and therefore performed the Conditions upon which it was &s;uppo&s;ed by the Prophet's being &s;ent to warn them, the threatned Puni&s;hment &s;hould be with-held.</P>
<P>And &s;o likewi&s;e in re&s;pect to Go&s;pel Threat|nings. If Men will &s;o far con&s;ult their own Welfare as to live <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to the Go&s;pel Terms, GOD certainly will not puni&s;h them, but on the con|trary confer upon them his Rewards,&mdash;But to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that HE will not puni&s;h, and that eter|nal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> too, impenitent, ob&s;tinate Sinners, ac|cording
<PB N="200" REF="004650_0204_100DDC7E51DB4618">
as he hath threatned, if they do not perform the Terms of the Go&s;pel, what is it, in Effect, but to make GOD like a Man, that he &s;hould lie, or the Son of Man that he &s;hould repent?</P>
<P>But the Ab&s;urdity of &s;uch an Opinion will appear &s;till more evident from</P>
<P>The next and <HI>Third</HI> Argument I &s;hall offer to prove, <HI>that the Torments re&s;erved for the Wicked hereafter are eternal, viz.</HI> From the Nature of the Chri&s;tian Covenant.</P>
<P>And here I mu&s;t again ob&s;erve, that it was taken for granted at the Beginning of this Di&s;|cour&s;e, that, <Q>You believe the Son of GOD came down to &s;ave Sinners; that there is but one Mediator between GOD and Man, even the Man CHRIST JESUS.</Q></P>
<P>And here I take it for granted farther (unle&s;s you believe the ab&s;urd and unwarrantable Doctrine of Purgatory) that you are fully per|&s;uaded, that this Life is the only Time al|lotted by Almighty GOD for working out our Salvation, and that after a few Years are pa&s;&s;ed over, there will remain no more Sacri|fice for Sin.</P>
<P>And if this be granted (and who dares deny it) it follows that if a wicked Man dieth in his Wickedne&s;s, and under the Wrath of GOD, he mu&s;t continue in that State to all Eternity.&mdash;For, &s;ince there is no Po&s;&s;ibility of his being de|livered out of &s;uch a Condition but by and thro' CHRIST; and &s;ince, at the Hour of Death, the Time of CHRIST'S Mediation and Interce&s;&s;ion
<PB N="201" REF="004650_0205_100DDC81315643A8">
for him is irrecoverably gone; the &s;ame Rea&s;on that may be given, why GOD &s;hould puni&s;h a Sinner that dieth under the Guilt of his Sins for a &s;ingle Day, will equally hold good, why he &s;hould continue to puni&s;h him for a Year, an Age, nay, to all Eternity.</P>
<P>But I ha&s;ten to the <HI>Fourth,</HI> and la&s;t Argument, to prove, <HI>That the Torments re&s;erved for the Wicked hereafter are Eternal,</HI> viz. <HI>Becau&s;e the Devil's Puni&s;hment is to be &s;o.</HI></P>
<P>That there is &s;uch a Being whom we call the <HI>Devil,</HI> that he was once an Angel of Light, but for his Pride and Rebellion again&s;t GOD was ca&s;t down from Heaven, and is now permitted with the re&s;t of his &s;piritual Wickedne&s;&s;es, to walk to and fro, &s;eeking whom they may de|vour.&mdash;That there is a Place of Torment re|&s;erved for them, or, to u&s;e the Apo&s;tle's Words, <HI>that they are re&s;erved in everla&s;ting Chains under Darkne&s;s unto the Judgment of the Great Day,</HI> are Truths all here pre&s;ent were &s;uppo&s;ed to be convinced of, when it was taken fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> granted under the &s;econd Propo&s;ition at the Beginning of this Di&s;cour&s;e, that you believed the <HI>Holy Scrip|tures</HI> to be written by the In&s;piration of GOD, wherein the&s;e Truths are delivered.</P>
<P>But then if we allow all this, and think it no In|ju&s;tice in GOD to puni&s;h tho&s;e Glorious Spirits for their Rebellion, how can we think it unju&s;t in him, to puni&s;h wicked Men for their Impeni|tency to all Eternity?</P>
<P>You will &s;ay perhaps, that they have &s;inned again&s;t greater Light, and therefore de&s;erve a
<PB N="202" REF="004650_0206_100DDC82B3BAFF08">
greater Puni&s;hment. And &s;o we grant that the Puni&s;hment of the fallen Angles m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> be greater as to Degree, than that of wicked Men. But then we affirm, it will be equal as to the Eternal Duration of it. For in that Day, as the lively Oracles of GOD inform us, &s;hall the Son of Man &s;ay to them on his left Hand, <HI>Depart from me ye Cur&s;ed into Everla&s;ting Fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</HI>&mdash;Where we find that im|penitent Sinners are to be ca&s;t into the &s;ame <HI>Everla&s;ting Fire,</HI> With the <HI>Devil</HI> and his Angels,&mdash;And that too very ju&s;tly.&mdash;For though they may have &s;inned again&s;t greater Light, yet Chri&s;|tians &s;in again&s;t greater Mercy. Since CHRIST took not hold of, did not die for the fallen An|gels, but of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> for Men and for our Salvation. So that if GOD &s;pared not tho&s;e Excellent Beings, a&s;&s;ure thy&s;elf, O ob&s;ti|nate Sinner, whoever thou art, he will by no means &s;pare thee.</P>
<P>From what then has been &s;aid it plainly ap|pears, that verily <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he Torments re&s;erved for the Wicked hereafter are Eternal.</HI>&mdash;And if &s;o, Bre|thren, how holy ought we to be in all Manner of Conver&s;ation and Godline&s;s, that we may be accounted worthy to e&s;cape this Wrath to come!</P>
<P>But before I proceed to a practical Exhorta|tion, permit me to draw an Inference or two from what has been &s;aid.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, <HI>If the Torments re&s;erved for the Wicked hereafter are Eternal,</HI> what &s;hall we &s;ay to tho&s;e, who make an open Profe&s;&s;ion in their
<PB N="203" REF="004650_0207_100DDC8696E73C48">
Creed to believe a Life Everla&s;ting, <HI>i. e.</HI> a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">e of Happine&s;s as well as Mi&s;ery, and yet dare to live in the actual Commi&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e Sins which will unavoidably, without Repentance, bring them into that Place of Torment? Thou believe&s;t the Puni&s;hments of the impenitently wicked in another Life, are Eternal: Thou doe&s;t well, <HI>The Devils al&s;o believe and tremble.</HI> But know, O vain Man, unle&s;s this Belief doth influence thy Practice, and makes thee bid Adieu to thy Sins, every Time thou repeate&s;t thy Creed, thou doe&s;t in Effect &s;ay, I believe I &s;hall be undone for ever.</P>
<P>But <HI>Secondly,</HI> if the Torments re&s;erved for the Wicked hereafter are Eternal, then let this &s;erve as a Caution to &s;uch Per&s;ons (and it is to be fear'd there are &s;ome &s;uch) who go about to di&s;&s;uade others from the Belief of &s;uch an important Truth. There being no &s;urer Way, in all Probability, to encourage and promote Infidelity and Prophanene&s;s, than the broaching or maintaining &s;uch an unwarranta|ble Doctrine&mdash;For if the po&s;itive Threats of GOD concerning the Eternity of Hell Torments are already found in&s;ufficient to deter Men from Sin, what a higher Pitch of Wickedne&s;s may we imagine they will quickly arrive at, when they are taught to entertain any Hopes of a Future Recovery out of them, or, what is &s;till wor&s;e, that their Souls are hereafter to be annihilated, and become like the Bea&s;ts that peri&s;h?&mdash;But Woe unto &s;uch blind Leaders of the Blind. No Wonder if they both fall
<PB N="204" REF="004650_0208_100DDC88469E7D10">
into the Ditch.&mdash;And let &s;uch Corrupters of GOD's Word know, that I te&s;tify unto every Man that heareth me this Day, that if any one &s;hall add unto, or take away from the Words that are written in the Book of GOD, GOD &s;hall take his Part out of the Book of Life, and &s;hall add unto him all the Plagues that are in that Book.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly</HI> and <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> if the Torments re&s;erved for the Wicked hereafter are Eternal, then this may &s;erve as a Reproof for tho&s;e who quarrel with GOD, and &s;ay it is incon&s;i&s;tent with his Ju&s;tice, to puni&s;h a Per&s;on to all Eternity, only for enjoying the Plea&s;ures of Sin for a Sea&s;on. But &s;uch Per&s;ons mu&s;t be told, that it is not their thinking or calling GOD unju&s;t, will make him &s;o, no more than a condemned Pri&s;oner's &s;aying the Law or Judge is unju&s;t, will render either duly chargeable with &s;uch an Imputation.&mdash;But knowe&s;t thou, O Worm, what Bla&s;phemy thou are guilty of, in charging GOD with Inju&s;tice?&mdash;<HI>Shall the Thing formed &s;ay to him that formed it, Why ha&s;t thou made me thus?</HI> And wilt thou pre&s;ume to arraign the Almighty at the Bar of thy &s;hallow Rea&s;oning? And call him unju&s;t, for puni&s;hing thee Eternally, only becau&s;e thou wi&s;he&s;t it may not be &s;o? But hath GOD &s;aid it; and &s;hall he not do it? He hath &s;aid it: And let GOD be true, tho' every Man be a Liar.&mdash;<HI>Shall not the Judge of all the Earth do right?</HI> A&s;&s;uredly he will. And if Sinners will not own his Ju&s;tice in his
<PB N="205" REF="004650_0209_100DDC8BE6694080">
Threatnings here, they will be compell'd e'er long to own and feel them when tormented by him hereafter.</P>
<P>But to come to a more practical Application of what has been deliver'd.</P>
<P>You have heard, Brethren, the Eternity of Hell-Torments plainly proved, from the expre&s;s Declarations of Holy Scriptures, and Con&s;e|quences naturally drawn from them.&mdash;And now there &s;eems to need no great Art of Rhetorick to per&s;uade any under&s;tanding Per&s;on to avoid and abhor tho&s;e Sins, which without Repentance will certainly plunge him into thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Eternal Gulph.&mdash;The Di&s;proportion between the Plea&s;ure and the Pain (if there be any Plea&s;ure in Sin) is &s;o infinitely great, that &s;uppo&s;ing it was only po&s;&s;ible, though not cer|tain, that the Wicked would be everla&s;tingly puni&s;hed, no one that has the Rea&s;on of a Man, for the Enjoying a little momentary Plea&s;ure, would, one would imagine, run the Hazard of enduring Eternal Pain.&mdash;But &s;ince the Torments of the Damned are not only po&s;&s;ible, but certain, (&s;ince GOD him&s;elf, who cannot lye, has told us &s;o) for Men, notwith&s;tanding to per&s;i&s;t in their Di&s;obedience, and then flatter them&s;elves that GOD will not make good his Threatnings, is a mo&s;t egregious In&s;tance of Folly and Pre&s;umption.</P>
<P><HI>Dives</HI> him&s;elf &s;uppo&s;ed, that if one ro&s;e from the Dead, his Brethren would amend their Lives; but Chri&s;tians, it &s;eems, will not repent, though the SON OF GOD has died

and ro&s;e again, and told them what they mu&s;t expect, if they &s;till continue ob&s;tinate in Evil Doing.</P>
<P>Would we now and then draw off our Thoughts from &s;en&s;ible Objects, and by Faith meditate a while on the Mi&s;eries of the Dam|ned, I doubt not but we &s;hould, as it were, hear many an unhappy Soul venting his fruit|le&s;s Sorrows in &s;ome &s;uch piteous Moans as the&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>DIRECTIONS how to hear SERMONS.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>LUKE viii. 18.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Take Heed therefore how you hear.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Occa&s;ion of our LORD's giving this Caution was this: Perceiving that much People were gathered together, to hear him, out of every City, and knowing (for he is GOD, and knoweth all Things) that many, if not mo&s;t of them, would be Hearers only, and not Doers of the Word, he &s;pake to them by a Parable, wherein, under the Similitude of a Sower, that went out to &s;ow his Seed, he plainly intimated how few there were among&s;t them who would receive any &s;aving Benefit from his Doctrine, or bring forth Fruit unto Perfection.</P>
<P>The Application, one would imagine, &s;hould be plain and obvious: But the Di&s;ciples, as yet unenlightened in any great Degree by the Holy Spirit, and therefore unable to &s;ee into the hidden My&s;teries of the Kingdom of GOD, dealt with our Saviour, as People ought to deal with their Mini&s;ters,&mdash;di&s;cour&s;ed with him
<PB N="211" REF="004650_0215_100DDC9DA136EA18">
privately about the Meaning of what he had taught them in Publick, and with a &s;incere De&s;ire of doing their Duty, asked for an Inter|pretation of the Parable.</P>
<P>Our ble&s;&s;ed LORD, as he always was willing to in&s;truct tho&s;e that were teachable (herein &s;etting his Mini&s;ters an Example to be courteous and ea&s;y of Acce&s;s) freely told them the Signi|fication of it. And withal, to make them more cautious and more attentive to his Doctrine for the future, He tells them, that they were in an e&s;pecial Manner to be the Light of the World, and were to proclaim on the Hou&s;e-Top what|&s;oever he told them in Secret. And as their improving the Knowledge already imparted, was the only Condition upon which more was to be given them, it therefore highly concerned them to <HI>take heed how they heard.</HI></P>
<P>From the Context then it appears, that the Words were primarily &s;poken to the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves. But becau&s;e they were the Repre|&s;entatives of the whole Church, and 'tis to be feared out of tho&s;e many Thou&s;ands that flock to hear Sermons, but few comparatively &s;peaking are effectually influenced by them; I cannot but think it very nece&s;&s;ary to remind you of the Caution given by our LORD to his Di&s;ciples, and to exhort you with the utmo&s;t Earne&s;tne&s;s to <HI>take heed how you hear.</HI></P>
<P>In Pro&s;ecution of which De&s;ign I &s;hall in the following Di&s;cour&s;e,

</LIST></P>
<P>I. And, <HI>Fir&s;t;</HI> I am to prove that every one ought to take all Opportunities of hearing Sermons.</P>
<P>That there have always been particular Per&s;ons &s;et apart by GOD to in&s;truct and exhort his People to practice what he &s;hould require of them, is evident from many Pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture.&mdash;St. <HI>Jude</HI> tells us, that <HI>Enoch</HI> the &s;eventh from <HI>Adam</HI> prophe&s;ied, or preached, concerning the LORD's coming with ten Thou&s;and of his Saints to Judgment. And <HI>Noah,</HI> who lived not long after, is &s;tiled by St. <HI>Peter, a Preacher of Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> And though in all the intermediate Space between the Flood and Giving of the Law, we hear but of few Preachers, yet we may rea&s;onably conclude, that GOD never left him|&s;elf without Witne&s;s, but at &s;undry Times, and after divers Manners, &s;poke to our Fathers by the Patriarchs and Prophets.</P>
<P>But however it was before, we are a&s;&s;ured that after the Delivery of the Law, GOD has con&s;tantly &s;eparated to him&s;elf a certain Order of Men to preach to, as well as pray for, his People; and commanded them to enquire their Duty at the Prie&s;ts Mouths. And though the <HI>Jews</HI> were frequently led into Captivity, and for their Sins &s;cattered abroad through the Face of the Earth, yet he never utterly for&s;ook his Church, but &s;till kept up a Remnant of Prophets and Preachers, as <HI>Ezekiel, Jeremiah, Daniel,</HI>

and others, to reprove, in&s;truct, and call them to Repentance.</P>
<P>Thus was it under the Law. Nor has the Church been wor&s;e, but infinitely better provi|ded for under the Go&s;pel: For when JESUS CHRIST, that great High Prie&s;t, had through the Eternal Spirit offered him&s;elf as a full, per|fect, &s;ufficient Sacrifice, Oblation and Satisfaction for the Sins of the whole World, and after his Re&s;urrection had all Power committed to him both in Heaven and Earth, he gave Commi&s;&s;ion to his Apo&s;tles, and in them to all &s;ucceeding Mini&s;ters, to go and preach his Go&s;pel to every Creature; promi&s;ing to be with them, to guide, a&s;&s;i&s;t, &s;trengthen and comfort them <HI>always, even to the End of the World.</HI></P>
<P>But if it be the Duty of Mini&s;ters to preach (and Woe be to them if they do not preach the Go&s;pel, for a Nece&s;&s;ity is laid upon them) no doubt, the People are obliged to attend to them; for otherwi&s;e, wherefore are Mini&s;ters &s;ent?</P>
<P>And how can we here avoid admiring the Love and tender Care which our dear Redeemer has expre&s;&s;ed for his Spou&s;e the Church? Who, becau&s;e he could not be always with us in Per&s;on, on account it was expedient he &s;hould go away, and as our Fore-runner take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that Glory he had purcha&s;ed by his precious Blood, yet would not leave us comfortle&s;s, but fir&s;t &s;ettled a &s;ufficient Number of Pa&s;tors and Teachers, and afterwards, according to his Promi&s;e, actually did and will continue to &s;end down the Holy Gho&s;t to furni&s;h them and their Succe&s;&s;ors with
<PB N="214" REF="004650_0218_100DDCA58EBF3138">
proper Gifts and Graces for the Work of the Mini&s;try, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the edifying of his Body in Love, till we all come in the Unity of the Spirit, to the Fulne&s;s of the Mea&s;ure of the Stature of CHRIST.</P>
<P>Oh! how in&s;en&s;ible are tho&s;e of this un&s;peak|able Gift, who do de&s;pite to the Spirit of Grace, who crucify the Son of GOD afre&s;h, and put him to an open Shame, by wilfully refu&s;ing to attend on &s;o great a Means of their Salvation? How dreadful will the End of &s;uch Men be? How aggravating, that Light &s;hould come into the World, that the glad Tidings of Salvation &s;hould be &s;o very frequently proclaimed in this City, and that &s;o many &s;hould loath this &s;piritual Manna, this Angels Food, and call it light Bread? How much more tolerable will it be for <HI>Tyre</HI> and <HI>Sidon,</HI> for <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> than for &s;uch Sinners? For better Men had never heard of a Saviour's being born, than after they have heard, not to give heed to the Mini&s;try of tho&s;e, who are employed as his Amba&s;&s;adors, to tran&s;act Affairs between GOD and their Souls.</P>
<P>We may, though at a Di&s;tance, without a Spirit of Prophe&s;y, foretel the deplorable Condi|tion of &s;uch Men; and behold them ca&s;t into Hell, lifting up their Eyes, being in Torment, and crying out, How often would our Mini&s;ters have <HI>gathered</HI> us, <HI>as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her Wings!&mdash;But we would not.&mdash;Oh that we had known in that our Day, the Things that be|longed to our everla&s;ting Peace!&mdash;But now they are for ever hid from our Eyes.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="004650_0219_100DDCA84805AE30">
Thus wretched, thus inconceivably mi&s;erable, will &s;uch be as &s;light and make a Mock at the publick Preaching of the Go&s;pel.&mdash;But taking it for granted, there are but few, if any, of this unhappy Stamp, who think it not worth their while to tread the Courts of the LORD's Hou&s;e, I pa&s;s on now to the</P>
<P>II. <HI>Second</HI> general Thing propo&s;ed,&mdash;To lay down &s;ome Cautions and Directions, in order to your hearing Sermons with Profit and Advantage.</P>
<P>And here, if we reflect on what has been already delivered, and con&s;ider that Preaching is an Ordinance of GOD, a Means appointed by JESUS CHRIST him&s;elf, for promoting his Kingdom among&s;t Men, you cannot rea&s;onably be offended, if, in order that you may hear Sermons with Profit and Advantage, I</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> direct or intreat you to come to hear them, not out of Curio&s;ity, but from a &s;incere De&s;ire to know and do your Duty.</P>
<P>Formality and Hypocri&s;y in any religious Exerci&s;e is an Abomination unto the LORD. And to enter his Hou&s;e merely to have our Ears entertained, and not our Hearts reformed, mu&s;t certainly be highly di&s;plea&s;ing to the Mo&s;t High GOD, as well as unprofitable to our &s;elves.</P>
<P>Hence it is, that &s;o many remain Unconver|ted, yea, Unaffected with the mo&s;t Evangelical Preaching; &s;o that like St. <HI>Paul'</HI>s Companions, they only hear the Preacher's Voice with their outward Ears, but do not experience the Power of it inwardly in their Hearts. Or like the
<PB N="216" REF="004650_0220_100DDCA9F498BCA8">
Ground near <HI>Gideon'</HI>s Fleece, they remain un|touched; whil&s;t others that came to be fed with the &s;incere Milk of the Word, like the Fleece it&s;elf, are watered by the Dew of GOD's Heavenly Ble&s;&s;ing, and grow thereby.</P>
<P>Flee therefore, my Brethren, flee Curio&s;ity; and prepare your Hearts by a humble Di&s;po&s;ition to receive with Meekne&s;s the engrafted Word, and then it will be a Means, under GOD, to quicken, build up, purify, and &s;ave your Souls.</P>
<P>A <HI>Second</HI> Direction I &s;hall lay down for the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, is, not only to prepare your Hearts before you hear, but al&s;o to give diligent heed to the Things that are &s;poken, whil&s;t you are hearing the Word of GOD.</P>
<P>If an earthly King was to i&s;&s;ue out a Royal Proclamation, on performing or not performing the Conditions wherein contained, the Life or Death of his Subjects entirely depended, how &s;ollicitous would they be to hear what tho&s;e Conditions were? And &s;hall not we pay the &s;ame Re&s;pect to the KING of KINGS, and LORD of LORDS, and lend an attentive Ear to his Amba&s;|&s;adors, when they are declaring in his Name on what Terms our Pardon, Peace, and Happine&s;s may be &s;ecured?</P>
<P>When GOD de&s;cended on Mount <HI>Sinai</HI> in terrible Maje&s;ty, to give unto his People the Law, how attentive were they to his Servant <HI>Mo&s;es?</HI> And if they were &s;o earne&s;t to hear the Thun|drings or Threatnings of the Law, &s;hall not we be as &s;ollicitous to hear from the Mini&s;ters of CHRIST, the glad Tidings of the Go&s;pel?</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="004650_0221_100DDCAEA6E50BE8">
Whil&s;t CHRIST was him&s;elf on Earth, it is &s;aid, that the People hung upon him to hear the gracious Words that proceeded out of his Mouth. And if we looked on Mini&s;ters as we ought, as the Repre&s;entatives of JESUS CHRIST, we &s;hould hang upon them to hear their Word<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> al&s;o.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the &s;acred Truths that Go&s;pel Mini|&s;ters deliver, are not dry in&s;ipid Lectures o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Moral Philo&s;ophy, intended only to amu&s;e u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> for a while; but the great My&s;teries of Godli|ne&s;s, which therefore we are bound &s;tudiou&s;ly to li&s;ten to, le&s;t through our Negligence we &s;hould either not under&s;tand them, or by any other Means let them &s;lip.</P>
<P>But how regardle&s;s are tho&s;e of this Direc|tion, who in&s;tead of hanging on the Preacher to hear him, doze or &s;leep whil&s;t he is &s;peaking to them from GOD? Unhappy Men! Can they not watch with our ble&s;&s;ed LORD one Hour? What; Have they never read how <HI>Eutichus</HI> fell down as he was &s;leeping, when St. <HI>Paul</HI> conti|nued his Di&s;cour&s;e till Midnight, and was taken up dead?</P>
<P>But to return. Though you may prepare your Hearts, as you may think, by a teachable Di&s;po&s;ition, and be attentive whil&s;t Di&s;cour&s;es are delivering, yet this will profit you little, unle&s;s you ob&s;erve a</P>
<P><HI>Third</HI> Direction,&mdash;not to entertain any the lea&s;t Prejudice again&s;t the Mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>For could a Preacher &s;peak with the Tongu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Men and Angels, if his Audience was
<PB N="218" REF="004650_0222_100DDCB02AAC3990">
prejudiced again&s;t him, he would be but as a &s;ounding Bra&s;s, or a tinkling Cymbal.</P>
<P>That was the Rea&s;on why JESUS CHRIST him&s;elf, the eternal Word, could not do many mighty Works, nor preach to any great Effect among tho&s;e of his own Country; for they were offended at him. And was this &s;ame JESUS, this GOD incarnate again to bow the Heavens, and to come down &s;peaking as never Man &s;pake; yet if we were prejudiced again&s;t him, as the <HI>Jews</HI> were, we &s;hould harden our Hearts as the <HI>Jews</HI> did theirs.</P>
<P>Take Heed therefore, my Brethren, and beware of entertaining any Di&s;like again&s;t tho&s;e whom the Holy Gho&s;t has made Over&s;eers over you. Con&s;ider that the Clergy are Men of like Pa&s;&s;ions with your&s;elves. And though we &s;hould even hear a Per&s;on teaching others to do, what he has not taught him&s;elf; yet that is no &s;uffi|cient Rea&s;on for rejecting his Doctrine. For Mini&s;ters &s;peak not in their own, but CHRIST'S Name. And we know who commanded the People to do what&s;oever the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Pha|ri&s;ees</HI> &s;hould &s;ay unto them, though they &s;aid but did not.</P>
<P>But, <HI>Fourthly,</HI> as you ought not be prejudiced again&s;t, &s;o you &s;hould be careful not to depend too much on a Preacher, or think more highly of him than you ought to think. For though this be an Extreme that People &s;eldom run into; yet preferring one Teacher, in Oppo&s;ition to another, has often been of ill Con&s;equence to the Church of GOD.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="004650_0223_100DDCB2DA4CE518">
That, we read, was a Fault which the great Apo&s;tle of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> condemned in the <HI>Corin|thians:</HI> For whereas one &s;aid, I am of <HI>Paul;</HI> another, I am of <HI>Apollos:</HI> Are ye not Carnal, &s;ays he? For who is <HI>Paul,</HI> and who is <HI>Apollos,</HI> but In&s;truments in GOD's Hand by whom you believed? And are not all Mini&s;ters &s;ent forth to be mini&s;tring Amba&s;&s;adors to tho&s;e who &s;hall be Heirs of Salvation? And are they not all therefore greatly to be e&s;teemed for their Work's Sake?</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle, it is true, commands us to pay double Honour to tho&s;e who labour in the Word and Doctrine. But then to prefer one Mini&s;ter at the Expence of another (perhaps to &s;uch a Degree, as when you have actually entered a Church, to come out again, becau&s;e he does not preach) is earthly, &s;en&s;ual, devili&s;h.</P>
<P>Not to mention that Popularity and Applau&s;e cannot but be exceeding dangerous even to a rightly informed Mind; and mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily fill any thinking Man with a holy Jealou&s;y, left he &s;hould take that Honour to him&s;elf, which is due only to GOD; who alone qualifies him for his Mini&s;terial Labours, and from whom alone every good and perfect Gift cometh.</P>
<P>A <HI>Fifth</HI> Direction I would recommend is, to make a particular Application of every Thing that is delivered, to your own Hearts.</P>
<P>When our Saviour was di&s;cour&s;ing at his la&s;t Supper with his beloved Di&s;ciples, and foretold that one of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;hould betray him, each of them immediately applied it to his own Heart, and
<PB N="220" REF="004650_0224_100DDCB461FB5358">
&s;aid, <HI>LORD, Is it I?</HI> And would Per&s;ons in lik Manner, when Preachers are di&s;&s;uading from any Vice, or per&s;uading to any Virtue, in&s;tead of crying, this was de&s;igned again&s;t &s;uch and &s;uch a one, turn their Thoughts inwardly, and &s;ay, <HI>LORD, Is it I?</HI> How far more beneficial &s;hould we find Di&s;cour&s;es to be, than they generally are now?</P>
<P>But we are apt to wander too much abroad: Always looking at the Mote which is in our Neighbour's Eye, rather than the Beam which is in our own.</P>
<P>Ha&s;te we now to the <HI>Sixth</HI> and la&s;t Direction: If you would receive a Ble&s;&s;ing from the LORD, when you hear his Word preached, pray to him, both before, in, and after every Sermon, to endue the Mini&s;ter with Power to &s;peak, and to grant you a Will and Ability to put in Practice what he &s;hall &s;hew from the Book of GOD to be your Duty.</P>
<P>This would be an excellent Means to render the Word preached effectual to the Enlightning and Enflaming your Hearts, and without this all the other Means before pre&s;cribed will be in vain.</P>
<P>No doubt it was this Con&s;ideration that made St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;o earne&s;tly intreat his beloved <HI>Ephe&s;ians</HI> to intercede with GOD for him,&mdash;<HI>Praying always,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>with all Manner of Prayer and Supplication in the Spirit; and for me al&s;o, that I may open my Mouth with Boldne&s;s, to make known the My&s;teries of the Go&s;pel.</HI> And if &s;o great an Apo&s;tle as St. <HI>Paul,</HI> needed the Prayers
<PB N="221" REF="004650_0225_100DDCB841619788">
of his People, much more do tho&s;e Mini&s;ters, who have only the ordinary Gifts of the Holy Spirit.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, this would be a good Proof that you &s;incerely de&s;ired to do as well as know the Will of GOD: And it mu&s;t highly profit both Mini|&s;ters and People; becau&s;e GOD through your Prayers will give them a double Portion of his Holy Spirit, whereby they will be enabled to in&s;truct you more fully in the Things which pertain to the Kingdom of GOD.</P>
<P>And oh! that all that hear me this Day would &s;eriou&s;ly apply their Hearts to practi&s;e what has now been told them!&mdash;How would Mini&s;ters &s;ee Satan like Lightning fall from Heaven, and People find the Word preached &s;harper than a two-edged Sword, and mighty through GOD to the pulling down of the Devil's &s;trong Holds!</P>
<P>The Holy Gho&s;t would then fall on all them that heard the Word; as when St. <HI>Peter</HI> preach|ed. The Go&s;pel of CHRIST would have free Cour&s;e, run very &s;wiftly, and Thou&s;ands again be converted by a Sermon.</P>
<P>For JESUS CHRIST, is the &s;ame Ye&s;terday, to Day, and for ever. He has promi&s;ed to be with his Mini&s;ters always, even unto the End of the World. And the Rea&s;on why we do not receive larger Effu&s;ions of the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit of GOD, is not, becau&s;e our All-powerful Redeemer's Hand is &s;hortned, but becau&s;e we are not prepared to receive them, and becau&s;e we do not expect them, but confine them to the Primitive Times.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="004650_0226_100DDCB9C3A1A060">
It does indeed &s;ometimes happen that GOD to magnify his Free Grace in CHRIST JESUS, is found of them that &s;ought him not; a notorious Sinner is forcibly worked upon by a publick Sermon, and plucked as a Fire-brand out of the Fire. But this is not GOD's ordinary Way of acting. No; for the Generality, he only vi&s;its tho&s;e with the Power of his Word, who humbly wait to know what he would have them to do. And &s;ends unqualified Hearers not only empty, but hardened, away.</P>
<P>Take heed, therefore, ye carele&s;s, curious Pro|fe&s;&s;ors, if any &s;uch be here pre&s;ent, how you hear&punc; Remember that, whether we think of it or not, we mu&s;t all appear before the Judgment Seat of CHRIST, where Mini&s;ters mu&s;t give a &s;trict Account of the Doctrine they have delivered, and you as &s;trict a one, how you have improved under it. And good GOD! how will you be able to &s;tand at the Bar of an angry, Sin-avenging Judge, and &s;ee &s;o many Di&s;cour&s;es you have de&s;|pi&s;ed, &s;o many Mini&s;ters who once longed and laboured for the Salvation of your precious and immortal Souls, brought out as &s;o many &s;wift Witne&s;&s;es again&s;t you? Will it be &s;ufficient then, think you, to alledge that you went to hear them only out of Curio&s;ity, to pa&s;s away an idle Hour, to admire the Oratory, or ridicule the Simplicity of the Preacher? No, GOD will then let you know, that you ought to have come out of better Principles, that every Sermon has been put down to your Account, and that you mu&s;t then be ju&s;tly puni&s;hed for not improving by them.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="004650_0227_100DDCBD6985EDB8">
But fear not, you little Flock, who with Meekne&s;s receive the ingra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ted Word, and bring forth the peaceable Fruits of Righteou&s;ne&s;s; for it &s;hall not be &s;o with you.

<P>But &s;till <HI>take you heed how you hear.</HI> For upon your improving the Grace you have, more &s;hall be given, and you &s;hall have abundance.

<P>They are Words of JESUS CHRIST him&s;elf: The Occa&s;ion of their being &s;poken was this,&mdash;As he was conver&s;ing with tho&s;e that were gathered round about him, he gave one of them an immediate Summons to follow him: But he, either afraid to go after &s;uch a per&s;ecuted Ma&s;ter, or rather loving this pre&s;ent World, &s;ays, <HI>Suffer me fir&s;t to go home and bury my Father,</HI> or, as mo&s;t explain it, <HI>Let me fir&s;t go and di&s;patch &s;ome important Bu&s;ine&s;s I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in Hand.</HI> But JESUS &s;aid unto him, <HI>Let <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Dead b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> their Dead;</HI> Leave Worldly Bu&s;ine&s;s to Wordly Men, let thy &s;ecular Bu&s;ine&s;s be left undone, rather than thou &s;hould&s;t neglect to follow me.</P>

<P>By the Word <HI>Religion</HI> I do not mean any Set of moral Vertues, and partial Amendment of our&s;elves, or formal Attendance on any outward Duties what&s;oever: but a thorough real Change of Nature wrought in us by the invi&s;ible, yet powerful Operation of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> pre&s;erved and nouri&s;hed in our Souls by a con&s;tant U&s;e of all the Means of Grace, evidenced by a good Life, and bringing forth the Fruits of the Spirit.</P>

This is the true and undefiled Religion, and for the perfecting this good Work in our Hearts, the eternal Son of GOD came down and &s;hed his precious Blood; for this End were we made, and &s;ent into the World, and by this alone can we become the Sons of GOD. Were we indeed to judge by the common Practice of the World, we might think we were &s;ent into it for no other Purpo&s;e than to care and toil for the uncertain Riches of this Life: But if we con&s;ult the lively Oracles, they will inform us, that we were born for nobler Ends,&mdash;to be born again from above,&mdash;to be re&s;tored to the Divine Likene&s;s by JESUS CHRIST our Second <HI>Adam,</HI> and thereby be made meet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> inherit the Kingdom of Heaven; and con|&s;equently, there is an Obligation laid upon all, even the mo&s;t bu&s;y People, to &s;ecure this End; it being an undeniable Truth, that all Creatures ought to an&s;wer the End for which they were created.</P>

<P>And will Men be &s;o much their own Ene|mies, as to affirm this belongs only to tho&s;e who mini&s;ter in holy Things? Does it not equally concern the mo&s;t active Man living?

There was no Harm in buying or &s;eeing a Piece of Ground, or in going to prove a Yoke of Oxen; but here lay their Fault,&mdash;They were doing the&s;e Things when they were invited to come to the Marriage Fea&s;t.</P>
<P>Without doubt, Per&s;ons may very hone&s;tly and commendably be employed in following their re&s;pective Callings; but yet, if they are engaged &s;o deeply in the&s;e, as to hinder their working out their Salvation with Fear and Trembling, they mu&s;t expect the &s;ame Sen|tence with their Predece&s;&s;ors in the Parable, that none of them &s;hall ta&s;te of CHRIST'S Supper; for our particular Calling, as of this or that Profe&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t never interfere with our general and precious Calling as we are Chri&s;tians.

<P>By the Holy Gho&s;t here &s;poken of, is &s;igni|fied the Holy Spirit,&mdash;the third Per&s;on in the e|ver ble&s;&s;ed Trinity,&mdash;con&s;ub&s;tantial and coeter|nal with the Father and the Son,&mdash;proceeding from, yet equal to them both.&mdash;He is emphati|cally called <HI>Holy,</HI> becau&s;e infinitely Holy in him|&s;elf, and the Author and Fini&s;her of all Holi|ne&s;s in us.</P>

<P>Thus &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, <HI>Know ye not that Chri&s;t is in you?</HI> that is, by his Spirit, <HI>unle&s;s you are Reprobates?</HI> Now if any Man hath not the Spirit of CHRIST, he is none of his.&mdash;And again, &s;ays St. <HI>John, We know that we are his by the Spirit that he hath given us.</HI></P>
<P>It is not indeed nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould have it now given in that miraculous Manner in which it was at fir&s;t given to our LORD's Apo|&s;tles, by Signs and Wonders.&mdash;But it is ab&s;olute|ly nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould receive the Holy Gho&s;t in his &s;anctifying Graces as really as they did, and &s;o will it continue to be till the End of the World.</P>
<P>For thus &s;tands the Ca&s;e between GOD and Man.&mdash;GOD at fir&s;t made Man upright, or as the &s;acred Penman expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>In the Image of GOD made he Man,</HI> that is, his Soul was the very Copy, the Tran&s;cript of the Divine Nature.&mdash;He that before had by his Almighty F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">at &s;poke the World into Being, breathed into Man the Breath of &s;piritual Life, and his Soul became adorned with all the Perfections of the Deity.&mdash;This was the fini&s;hing Stroke of the Creation: The Perfection both of the moral and material World,&mdash;and &s;o near re&s;embled its Divine Origi|nal, that GOD could not but rejoyce, and take Plea&s;ure in his own Likene&s;s&mdash;And therefore we read, that when GOD had fini&s;hed th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> ina|animate

and bruti&s;h Part of the Creation, he looked upon it, and behold it was <HI>Good;</HI> but when that lovely Godlike Creature, <HI>Man,</HI> was made, behold it was <HI>very Good.</HI></P>
<P>Happy then, un&s;peakably happy mu&s;t Man needs be, who was thus Partaker of the Divine Nature; and thus might. we have &s;till continued, had he &s;till continued Holy.&mdash;But GOD had placed him in a State of Probation, with a free Grant to eat of every Tree in the Garden of <HI>Eden,</HI> except the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.&mdash;The Day he did eat thereof he was &s;urely to die; that is, not only to be &s;ubject to temporal, but &s;piritual Death, and con&s;equently to lo&s;e that Divine Image, that &s;piritual Life GOD had not long &s;ince breathed into him, and which was as much his Happine&s;s as his Glory.</P>
<P>The&s;e, one would imagine, were ea&s;y Con|ditions for a finite Creature's Happine&s;s to de|pend on. But Man, unhappy Man, being &s;e|duced by the Devil, and de&s;iring like him, to be equal with his Maker, eat of the forbidden Fruit, and thereby became liable to that Cur&s;e which the Eternal GOD, who cannot lie, had denoun|ced again&s;t his Di&s;obedience.</P>
<P>Accordingly we read, that &s;oon after <HI>Adam</HI> had fallen, he complained that he was naked.&mdash;Naked not only as to his Body, but Naked and left de&s;titute of tho&s;e Divne Graces, which before decked and beautified his Soul.&mdash;The un|happy Mutiny and Di&s;order which the vi&s;ible Creation fell into, tho&s;e Briars and Thorns which now &s;prung up and over&s;pread the Earth,

were but poor Emblems, but lifele&s;s Repre&s;en|tations of that Confu&s;ion and Rebellion, tho&s;e divers Lu&s;ts and Pa&s;&s;ions which &s;prung up in, and quite overwhelmed the Soul of Man imme|diately after the Fall.&mdash;Alas! he was now no longer the Image of the invi&s;ible GOD; but as he had imitated the Devil's Sin, he became Par|taker of the Devil's Nature, and from an Union with, &s;unk into a State of direct Enmity again&s;t GOD.</P>
<P>Now in this dreadful di&s;ordered Condition are all of us brought into the World.&mdash;For as the Root is, &s;uch mu&s;t the Branches be.&mdash;According|ly we are told, that <HI>Adam</HI> begat a Son in his own Likene&s;s, that is with the &s;ame corrupt Nature which he him&s;elf had &s;unk into after he had eaten the forbidden Fruit. And Experience, as well as Scripture proves, that we al&s;o are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">l|together born in Sin and Corruption, and there|fore uncapable, whil&s;t in &s;uch a State, to hold Communion with GOD.&mdash;For as Light cannot have Communion with Darkne&s;s, &s;o GOD can have no Communion with &s;uch polluted Sons of <HI>Belial.</HI></P>
<P>Here then appears the End and De&s;ign why CHRIST was made manife&s;t in the Fle&s;h.&mdash;<HI>viz.</HI> to put an End to the&s;e Di&s;orders, and to re&s;tore us to that primitive Dignity in which we were at fir&s;t created.&mdash;Accordingly he &s;hed his precious Blood to &s;atisfy his Father's Ju&s;tice for our Sins, and thereby al&s;o he purcha&s;ed again for us the HOLY GHOST, who &s;hould once more re-in&s;tamp the Divine Image upon our

Hearts, and make us capable of living with and enjoying GOD.</P>
<P>This, I &s;ay, was the only End of our LORD's coming into the World&mdash;Nay, this is the only End why the World it&s;elf is now kept in Being. For as &s;oon as a &s;ufficient Number are &s;anctified out of it, the Heavens &s;hall be wrapped up like a Scrowl, the Elements &s;hall melt with fervent Heat, the Earth and all that therein is &s;hall be burnt up.</P>
<P>This is that New-Birth mentioned by our ble&s;&s;ed LORD to <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> without which we cannot &s;ee the Kingdom of GOD. This is what St. <HI>Paul</HI> calls being renewed in the Spirit of our Minds, and herein con&s;i&s;ts that Holine&s;s without which no Man &s;hall &s;ee the LORD.</P>
<P>In this manner then it is undeniably certain we mu&s;t receive the HOLY GHOST e'er we can be &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ed true Members of CHRIST'S my&s;tical Body.</P>
<P>II. I come now, in the <HI>Second</HI> Place, to lay down &s;ome &s;criptural Marks, whereby we may ea&s;ily judge whether we have received the HOLY GHOST or not.</P>
<P>And the <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> Mark I &s;hall mention is,&mdash;our having received a Spirit of Prayer and Supplica|tion:&mdash;For that always accompanies the Spirit of Grace.&mdash;No &s;ooner was <HI>Paul</HI> converted, but behold he prayeth, &s;ays JESUS CHRIST. And this was urged as an Argument to convince <HI>Ana|nias</HI> that he was converted. And GOD's Elect are &s;aid to cry to him Day and Night.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="004650_0251_100DDCFAAD122988">
For &s;ince one great Work of the Holy Spirit is to convince us of Sin, and to &s;et us upon &s;eek|ing Pardon and renewing Grace thro' the all-&s;ufficient Merits of a crucified Redeemer, who&s;o|ever has felt the Powers of the World to come awakening him from his &s;piritual Lethargy, can|not but be always crying out, LORD what would&s;t thou have me do? Or in the Language of the importunate blind <HI>Bartimeus,</HI> JESUS, thou Son of <HI>David,</HI> have Mercy upon me.</P>
<P>The ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, as he received the Holy Gho&s;t without Mea&s;ure, &s;o he evidenced it by nothing more than his frequent Addre&s;&s;es at the Throne of Grace. Accordingly we read, that he was often alone on the Mountain praying&mdash;That he ro&s;e a great while before Day to pray.&mdash;Nay that he &s;pent whole Nights in Prayer.&mdash;And who&s;oever is made Partaker of the &s;ame Spirit with the HOLY JESUS, will be of the &s;ame Mind, and delight in nothing &s;o much as to draw night unto GOD, and lift up holy Hands and Hearts in fervent and devout Prayer.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed indeed that this Spirit of Supplication is often as it were &s;en&s;ibly lo&s;t, and decays for &s;ome Time even in tho&s;e who have actually received the Holy Gho&s;t. And they, thro' &s;piritual Dryne&s;s and Barrenne&s;s of Soul, find in them&s;elves a Li&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s and Backwardne&s;s to this Duty of Prayer;&mdash;but then they take it as their Cro&s;s, and &s;till pre&s;evere in &s;eeking JESUS tho' it be &s;orrowing. And their Hearts notwith&s;tand|ing are fixed upon GOD, tho' they cannot exert their Affections &s;o &s;trongly as u&s;ual, on

Account of that &s;piritual Deadne&s;s which GOD for wi&s;e Rea&s;ons has &s;uffered to benumb their Souls.</P>
<P>But as for the formal Believer, it is not &s;o with him. No, he either prays not at all, or if he does enter into his Clo&s;et, it is with Reluctance&mdash;out of Cu&s;tom&mdash;or to &s;atisfy the Checks of his Con|&s;cience&mdash;Whereas the true Believer can no more live without Prayer, than without Food Day by Day. And he finds his Soul as really and per|ceptibly fed by the one, as his Body is nouri&s;hed and &s;upported by the other.</P>
<P>A Second Scripture Mark of our having re|ceived the HOLY GHOST, is&mdash;not commit|ting Sin.&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Who&s;oever is born of GOD, &s;ays St. John, &s;inneth not, neither can be &s;in becau&s;e his Seed remaineth in him</HI>&mdash;Neither can he &s;in&mdash;This Expre&s;&s;ion does not imply the Impo&s;&s;ibility of a &s;piritual Man's &s;inning. For we are told, that in many Things we offend all. It means only thus much; that a Man that is really born again of GOD, doth not wilfully commit Sin, much le&s;s live in the habitual Practice of it. For how &s;hall he that is dead to Sin, as every converted Per&s;on is, live any longer therein?</P>
<P>'Tis true a Man that is born again of GOD may, thro' Surprize or Violence of a Temptati|on, fall into an Act of Sin: Witne&s;s the Adul|tery of <HI>David,</HI> and <HI>Peter's</HI> De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ial of his Ma&s;ter. But then, like them, he quickly ri&s;es again, goes out from the World, and weeps bitterly; wa&s;hes the Guilt of Sin away by the Tears of a &s;incere

Repentance, joined with Faith in the Blood of JESUS CHRIST; takes double Heed to his Ways for the future, and perfects Holine&s;s in the Fear of GOD.</P>
<P>The Meaning of this Expre&s;&s;ion of the A|po&s;tle, that a Man that is born again of GOD, cannot commit Sin, has been<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Law's <HI>Chri&s;tian Perfection.</HI></NOTE> fitly illu&s;trated in the Example of a covetous Worldling, to the general Bent of who&s;e Inclinations, Liberality and Profu&s;ene&s;s are directly oppo&s;ite. But if, upon &s;ome unexpected &s;udden Occa&s;ion, he does play the Prodigal, he immediately repents him of his Fault, and returns with double Care to his Saving|ne&s;s again.&mdash;And &s;o is every one that is born a|gain. To commit Sin is as contrary to the ha|bitual Frame and Tendency of his Mind, as Ge|nero&s;ity is to the Inclinations of a Mi&s;er. But if at any Time he is drawn into Sin, he immedi|ately with double Zeal returns to his Duty, and brings forth Fruits meet for Repentance.</P>
<P>Whereas the unconverted Sinner is quite dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins,&mdash;or if he does ab&s;tain from the gro&s;s Acts of it, from worldly &s;elfi&s;h Motives, yet there is &s;ome Right Eye he will not pluck out; &s;ome Right Hand which he will not cut off; &s;ome &s;pecious <HI>Agag</HI> that he will not &s;a|crifice for GOD; and thereby he is convinced, that he is but a mere <HI>Saul;</HI> and con&s;equent|ly, whatever Preten&s;ions he may make to the contrary, he has not yet received the HOLY GHOST.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="004650_0254_100DDD04AE1C1F78">
A <HI>Third</HI> Mark whereby we may know whe|ther or not we have received the Holy Gho&s;t is,&mdash;our Conque&s;t over the World.&mdash;For <HI>who|ever is born of GOD,</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, <HI>overcometh the World.</HI>&mdash;By the World we are to under&s;tand, as St. <HI>John</HI> expre&s;&s;es it, all that is in the World, the Lu&s;t of the Eye, the Lu&s;t of the Fle&s;h, and Pride of Life,&mdash;And by overcoming of it is meant our renouncing the&s;e, &s;o as not to follow or be led by them.&mdash;For who&s;oever is born from above, has his Affections &s;et on Things above: He feels a Divine Attraction in his Soul, which forcibly draws his Mind Heavenwards; and as the Hart panteth after the Water-Brooks, &s;o doth it make his Soul to long after the Enjoyment of his GOD.</P>
<P>Not that he is &s;o taken up with the Affairs of another Life, as to neglect the Bu&s;ine&s;s of this. No, a truly &s;piritual Man dares not &s;tand any Day idle: But then he takes Care, though he laboureth for the Meat which peri&s;heth, fir&s;t to &s;ecure that which endureth to everla&s;ting Life. Or if GOD has exalted him above his Brethren, yet, like <HI>Mo&s;es, Jo&s;eph</HI> and <HI>Daniel,</HI> he notwith|&s;tanding looks upon him&s;elf as a Stranger and Pilgrim upon Earth.&mdash;Having received a Prin|ciple of new Life, he walks by Faith and not by Sight.&mdash;And his Hopes being full of Immortali|ty, he can look on all Things here below as Vanity and Vexation of Spirit.&mdash;In &s;hort, tho' he is in, yet is not of the World: And as he was made for the Enjoyment of GOD, &s;o nothing but GOD can &s;atisfy his Soul.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="004650_0255_100DDD06324504C0">
The ever ble&s;&s;ed JESUS was a perfect In&s;tance of overcoming the World. For though he went continually about doing Good, and always lived in a Pre&s;s, yet wherever he was, his Conver&s;ati|on tended Heavenwards. In like Manner he that is joined to the LORD in one Spirit, will &s;o order his Thoughts, Words, and Actions aright, that he will evidence to all, that his Conver&s;ation is in Heaven.</P>
<P>On the contrary, an unconverted Man being of the Earth, is earthly: And having no &s;piritual Eye to di&s;cern &s;piritual Things, is always &s;eeking for Happine&s;s in this Life, where it never was, will, or can be found. Being not born again from above, he is bowed down by a Spirit of natural Infirmity; the Serpent's Cur&s;e becomes his Choice, and he eats of the Du&s;t of the Earth all the Days of his Life.</P>
<P>A <HI>Fourth</HI> Scripture Mark of our <HI>New Birth,</HI> or of our having received the Holy Gho&s;t, is,&mdash;our loving one another.</P>
<P><HI>We know,</HI> &s;ays St. <HI>John, we are pa&s;&s;ed from Death unto Life, becau&s;e we love the Brethren.&mdash;And by this,</HI> &s;ays JESUS CHRIST, <HI>&s;hall all Men know, that you are my Di&s;ciples, if ye have Love one towards another.</HI>&mdash;Love is the fulfilling of the Go&s;pel, as well as the Law; for GOD is Love, and who&s;oever dwelleth in GOD, dwel|leth in Love.</P>
<P>But by this Love we are not to under&s;tand, a Softne&s;s and Tenderne&s;s of meer Nature, or a a Love founded on worldly Motives (for this a natural Man may have) but a Love of our
<PB N="26" REF="004650_0256_100DDD0994A58D90">
Brethren proceeding from a Love towards GOD. Loving all Men in general, becau&s;e GOD loves all Men, and loving good Men in particular, for the Grace we &s;ee in them, and becau&s;e they love our Lord JESUS in Sincerity.</P>
<P>This is Chri&s;tian Charity, and that new Commandment which CHRIST gave his Di&s;ciples. New not in its Object, but in the Motive and Example whereon it is founded, even JESUS CHRIST. This is that Love which the primi|tive Chri&s;tians were &s;o renowned for, that it became a Proverb.&mdash;<HI>See, how the&s;e Chri&s;tians love one another.</HI>&mdash;And without this Love, tho' we &s;hould give all our Goods to feed the Poor, and our Bodies to be burnt, it would profit us nothing.</P>
<P>Farther, this Love is not confined to any par|ticular Set of Men, but is impartial and catholic. A Love that embraces GOD's Image where-ever it beholds it, and that delights in nothing &s;o much as to &s;ee CHRIST's Kingdom come.</P>
<P>This is the Love wherewith JESUS CHRIST loved Mankind.&mdash;He loved all, even the wor&s;t of Men, as appears by his weeping over the ob|&s;tinately perver&s;e; but wherever he &s;aw the lea&s;t Appearance of the Divine Likene&s;s, that Soul he loved in particular.&mdash;Thus we read, that when he heard the young Man &s;ay, <HI>All the&s;e Things have I kept from my Youth,</HI> that &s;o far he loved him. And when he &s;aw any noble In&s;tance of Faith, though in a <HI>Centurion,</HI> a <HI>Syro-phoenician,</HI> Aliens to the Commonwealth of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> how is he &s;aid to marvel at it, as Man, to rejoyce in it,
<PB N="27" REF="004650_0257_100DDD0D83E8C350">
&s;peak of, and commend it?&mdash;So al&s;o every &s;piritual Di&s;ciple of JESUS CHRIST will cordially embrace all that wor&s;hip GOD in Spirit and in Truth, how&s;oever they may differ as to the Appendages of Religion, and Things not e&s;&s;en|tially nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s indeed that the Heart of a natural Man is not thus enlarged all at once; and a Per&s;on may really have received the Holy Gho&s;t (as <HI>Peter</HI> no doubt had when he was unwilling to go to <HI>Cornelius</HI>) though he be not arrived to this.&mdash;But then we affirm, where a Per&s;on is truly in CHRIST, all Narrowne&s;s of Spirit decrea&s;es in him daily; the Partition-Wall of Bigotry and Party Zeal is broken down more and more; and the nearer he comes to Heaven the more his Heart is enlarged with that Love which there will make no Difference between any People, Nation or Language, but we &s;hall all with one Heart, and one Voice, &s;ing Prai&s;es to him that &s;itteth upon the Throne for ever.</P>

Good to you, what do you more than others? What do you extraordinary? Do not even the <HI>Publicans</HI> the &s;ame?&mdash;And the&s;e Precepts our LORD confirmed by his own Example, when he wept over the bloody City; when he &s;uffered him&s;elf to be led as a Sheep to the Slaughter; when he made that mild Reply to the Traytor <HI>Judas, Judas betraye&s;t thou the Son of Man with a Ki&s;s;</HI>&mdash;And more e&s;pecially when in the Agonies and Pangs of Death, he prayed for his very Murderers, <HI>Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.</HI></P>
<P>This is the mo&s;t difficult Duty to the natural Man, but who&s;oever is made Partaker of that Promi&s;e of the Father, will find it practicable and ea&s;y. For if we are born again of GOD, we mu&s;t be like him; and con&s;equently delight to be perfect in this Duty of doing good to our wor&s;t Enemies in the &s;ame Manner, though not in the &s;ame Degree as he is perfect.&mdash;And he &s;ends his Rain on the Evil and the Good, cau&s;eth his Sun to &s;hine on the Ju&s;t and Unju&s;t: And herein more e&s;pecially commendeth his Love towards us, that whil&s;t we were his Enemies, he &s;ent forth his Son, born of a Woman, made under the Law, that he might become a Cur&s;e for us.</P>
<P>Many other Marks there are &s;cattered up and down the Scriptures, whereby we m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y know whether or not we have received the Holy Gho&s;t.

<P>That JESUS &s;hould ri&s;e from the Dead was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, fir&s;t on his own Account&mdash;For he had often appealed to this as the la&s;t and mo&s;t convincing Proof he would give them that he was the true Me&s;&s;iah,&mdash;<HI>There &s;hall no other Sign be given you,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>than the Sign of the Prophet</HI> Jonas.&mdash;And again, <HI>De&s;troy this Temple of my Body, and in three Days I will build it up.</HI>

<P>It had plea&s;ed the Father (for ever adored be his infinite Love and free Grace) to wound his only Son for our Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and to ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> and confine him in the Pri&s;on of the Grave, as our Surety for the Guilt we had contracted by &s;etting at nought his Commandments.&mdash;Now had CHRIST continued always in the Grave, we could have had no more A&s;&s;urance that our Sins were &s;atisfied for, than any common Debtor can have of his Creditor's being &s;atisfied whil&s;t his Surety is kept confined.&mdash;But he being relea&s;ed from the Power of Death, we are thereby a&s;&s;ured that in his Sacrifice GOD was well plea&s;ed,&mdash;that our Attone<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">nt was fini&s;hed on the Cro&s;s&mdash;and that he had made a full, perfect, and &s;ufficient Sacri|fice, C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ation, and Satisfaction for the Sins of the whole World.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> It was nece&s;&s;ary that our Lord JESUS &s;hould ri&s;e again from the Dead, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a&s;&s;ure us of the Certainty of the Re&s;urrection of our own Bodies.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="004650_0268_100DDD288B6E54A0">
The Doctrine of the Re&s;urrection of the Body was entirely exploded and &s;et at nought among the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> as appears from the <HI>Athenians</HI> mock|ing at and calling St. <HI>Paul</HI> a Babler and a Setter forth of &s;trange Doctrines, when he preached to them JESUS, and the Re&s;urrection.&mdash;And though it was believed by mo&s;t of the <HI>Jews,</HI> as is evident from many Pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture; yet not by all; the whole Sect of the <HI>Sadducees</HI> denied it. But the Re&s;urrection of JESUS CHRIST put it out of Di&s;pute.&mdash;For a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> he acted as our Repre&s;entative, if he our Head be ri&s;en, then mu&s;t we al&s;o, who are his Members, ri&s;e with him.&mdash;And as in the fir&s;t <HI>Adam</HI> we all died, even &s;o in him our &s;econd <HI>Adam</HI> we mu&s;t all in this Sen&s;e be made alive.</P>
<P>As it was nece&s;&s;ary, upon all the&s;e Accounts, that our Ble&s;&s;ed LORD &s;hould ri&s;e from the Dead; &s;o it is plain beyond Contradiction, that he did. Never was any Matter of Fact better atte&s;ted. Never were more Precautions made u&s;e of to prevent a Cheat.&mdash;He was buried in a Sepulchre, hewn out of a Rock, &s;o that it could not be &s;aid that any digged under, and conveyed him away. It was a Sepulchre al&s;o wherein ne|ver Man before was laid; &s;o that if any Body did ri&s;e from thence, it mu&s;t be the Body of JESUS of of <HI>Nazareth.</HI>&mdash;Be&s;ides, the Sepulchre was &s;ealed; a great Stone rolled to the Mouth of it, and a Band of Soldiers (con&s;i&s;ting not of his Friends, but of his profe&s;&s;ed Enemies) was &s;et to guard it.&mdash;And as for his Di&s;ciples coming by Night and &s;tealing him away, it was altogether impo&s;&s;ible. For it was not long &s;ince that they had all for|&s;aken
<PB N="39" REF="004650_0269_100DDD2BB2AD30B8">
him, and they were the mo&s;t backward in believing his Re&s;urrection.&mdash;And &s;uppo&s;ing it was true that they came whil&s;t the Soldiers &s;lept; yet the Soldiers mu&s;t be ca&s;t into a Deep Sleep indeed, that the rolling away &s;o great a Stone did not awake &s;ome of them.</P>
<P>And our Ble&s;&s;ed LORD's afterwards appearing at &s;undry Times, and in divers Manners, to his Di&s;ciples, when they were a&s;&s;embled together, when they were walking to <HI>Emmaus,</HI> when they were fi&s;hing; nay, and conde&s;cending to &s;hew them his Hands and Feet, and his at length ap|pearing to above five hundred Brethren at once, put the Truth of his Re&s;urrection out of all Di&s;pute.</P>
<P>Indeed there is one Objection that may be made again&s;t what has been &s;aid,&mdash;That the Books wherein the&s;e Facts are recorded were written by his Di&s;ciples.</P>
<P>And who more proper Per&s;ons than tho&s;e who were Eye-Witne&s;&s;es of what they related, and eat and drank with him after his Re&s;urrection. "But they were illiterate and ignorant Men." Yet as good Witne&s;&s;es of a plain Matter of Fact, as the mo&s;t learned Ma&s;ters in <HI>I&s;rael.</HI>&mdash;Nay, this rendered them more proper Witne&s;&s;es.&mdash;For be|ing plain Men, they were therefore le&s;s to be &s;u&s;pected of telling or making a Lye,&mdash;particu|larly, &s;ince they laid down their Lives for a Te&s;timony of the Truth of it. We read indeed of <HI>Jacob'</HI>s telling a Lie, though he was a plain Man, in order to get his Father's Ble&s;&s;ing. But it was never heard &s;ince the World began, that
<PB N="40" REF="004650_0270_100DDD2E70192028">
any Man, much le&s;s a whole Set of Men, died Martyrs for the Sake of an Untruth, when they them&s;elves were to reap no Advantage from it.</P>
<P>No, this &s;ingle Circum&s;tance proves them to be <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> indeed, in whom was no Guile.&mdash;And the wonderful Succe&s;s GOD gave to their Mini&s;try afterwards, when three thou&s;and were converted by one Sermon, and twelve poor Fi&s;her|men, in a very &s;hort Time were enabled to be more than Conquerors over all the Oppo&s;ition Men or Devils could make, was as plain a De|mon&s;tration, that CHRIST was ri&s;en; according to their Go&s;pel, as that a Divine Power, at the Sound of a few Ram's Horns, cau&s;ed the Walls of <HI>Jericho</HI> to fall down.</P>
<P>But what need we any farther Witne&s;&s;es? Be|lieve you the Re&s;urrection of our Ble&s;&s;ed LORD? I know that you believe it, as your gathering to|gether on this fir&s;t Day of the Week in the Courts of the LORD's Hou&s;e abundantly te&s;tifies.</P>
<P>What concerns us mo&s;t to be a&s;&s;ured of, and which is the</P>
<P><HI>Second</HI> Thing I was to &s;peak to is,&mdash;Whether we have experimentally known the Power of his Re&s;urrection; that is, <HI>Whether or not we have received the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> and by his powerful Operations on our Hearts been rai&s;ed from the Death of Sin, to a Life of Righteou&s;ne&s;s and true Holine&s;s.</P>
<P>It was this the great Apo&s;tle was chiefly de|&s;irous to know.&mdash;The Re&s;urrection of CHRIST'S Body he was &s;atisfied would avail him nothing, unle&s;s he experienced the Power of it in rai&s;ing his dead Soul.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="004650_0271_100DDD2FF406EC88">
For another, and that a chief End of our Ble&s;|&s;ed LORD's ri&s;ing from the Dead, was to enter Heaven as our Repre&s;entative, and to &s;end down the Holy Gho&s;t to apply that Redemption he had fini&s;hed on the Cro&s;s to our Hearts, by working an entire Change in them.</P>
<P>Without this, CHRIST would have died in vain. For it would have done us no Service to have his outward Righteou&s;ne&s;s imputed to us, unle&s;s we had an inward inherent Righteou&s;ne&s;s wrought in us.&mdash;Becau&s;e being altogether con|ceived and born in Sin, and con&s;equently unfit&punc; to hold Communion with an infinitely pure and holy GOD, we cannot po&s;&s;ibly be made meet to &s;ee or enjoy him, till a thorough Renovation has pa&s;&s;ed upon our Hearts.</P>
<P>Without this, we leave out the Holy Gho&s;t in the great Work of our Redemption.&mdash;But as we were made by the Joint Concurrence and Con&s;ultation of the ble&s;&s;ed Trinity. And as we were baptized in their Name&mdash;So mu&s;t a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of them concur in rendring that Bapti&s;m effectual to our Salvation: As the Father made, and the Son Redeemed, &s;o mu&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t &s;anctify and &s;eal us, or otherwi&s;e we have believed in vain.</P>
<P>This then is what the Apo&s;tle means by the Power of CHRIST'S Re&s;urrection, and this is what we are as much concerned experimentally to know, as that He ro&s;e at all.</P>
<P>Without this, though we may be Morali&s;ts, though we may be civilized, good natur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> People, yet we are no Chri&s;tians&mdash;For he is not a true Chri&s;tian, who is only one outwardly; nor have

we therefore a right Faith, becau&s;e we daily pro|fe&s;s to believe that CHRIST ro&s;e again the third Day from the Dead. But he is a true Chri&s;tian who is one inwardly; and then only can we be &s;tiled true Believers, when we not only profe&s;s to believe, but have felt the Power of our ble&s;&s;ed LORD's ri&s;ing from the Dead, by being quick|ned and rai&s;ed by his Spirit when dead in Tre&s;|pa&s;&s;es and Sins, to a thorough Newne&s;s both of Heart and Life.</P>
<P>The Devils them&s;elves cannot but believe the Doctrine of the Re&s;urrection and tremble&mdash;But yet they continue Devils, becau&s;e the Benefits of this Re&s;urrection have not been applied to them, nor have they received a renovating Power from it to change and put off their Diabolical Nature&mdash;And &s;o likewi&s;e, unle&s;s we not only profe&s;s to know, but al&s;o feel that CHRIST is ri&s;en indeed, by being born again from above, we &s;hall be as far from the Kingdom of GOD as they, our Fai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> will be as ineffectual as the Faith of Devils.</P>
<P>Nothing has done more harm to the Chri&s;tian World; nothing has rendered the Cro&s;s of CHRIST of le&s;s Effect, than a vain Suppo&s;ition that Re|ligion is &s;omething without us&mdash;Whereas we &s;hould con&s;ider that every thing that CHRIST did outwardly, mu&s;t be done over again in our Souls; or otherwi&s;e believing there was &s;uch a divine Per&s;on once on Earth, who triumphed over Hell and the Grave, will profit us no more, than be|lieving there was once &s;uch a Per&s;on as <HI>Alexander,</HI> who conquered the World.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="004650_0273_100DDD360D3AA478">
As CHRIST was born of the Virgin's Womb, &s;o mu&s;t he be &s;piritually formed in our Hearts&mdash;As He died for Sin, &s;o mu&s;t we die to Sin&mdash;And as he ro&s;e again from the Dead, &s;o mu&s;t we al&s;o ri&s;e to a Divine Life.</P>

<P>'Tis true, as for the outward Work of our Re|demption it was a tran&s;ient Act, and was certain|ly fini&s;hed on the Cro&s;s&mdash;But the Application of that Redemption to our Hearts is a Work that will continue always, even unto the End of the World.</P>
<P>So long as there is a Man breathing on the Earth, who is naturally engendred of the Off|&s;pring of the fir&s;t <HI>Adam,</HI> &s;o long mu&s;t the quick|ening Spirit which was purcha&s;ed by the Re&s;ur|rection of the &s;econd <HI>Adam,</HI> that LORD from Heaven, be Breathing upon his Soul.</P>
<P>For tho' we may exi&s;t by CHRIST, yet we can|not be &s;aid to exi&s;t in Him, till we are united to him by one Spirit, and enter into a new State of Things, as certainly as He entred into a new State of Things, after that he ro&s;e from the Dead.</P>
<P>We may throng and crowd around about CHRIST, and call him LORD, LORD, when we come to wor&s;hip before his Foot&s;tool; but we have not effectually touched Him, till by a lively Faith in His Re&s;urrection, we perceive a Divine Virtue coming out of Him, to renew &amp; purify our Souls.</P>

How greatly then do they err who re&s;t in a bare Hi&s;torical Faith of our Saviour's Re&s;urrec|tion, and look only for external Proofs to evidence it? Whereas were we the mo&s;t learned Di&s;puters of this World, and could &s;peak of the Certainty of this Fact with the Tongue of Men and An|gels, yet without this inward Te&s;timony of it in our Hearts, tho' we might convince others, yet we &s;hould never be &s;aved by it our&s;elves.</P>
<P>For we are but dead Men, we are but like &s;o many Carca&s;&s;es wrapt up in Grave Cloaths, till that &s;ame JESUS who called <HI>Lazarus</HI> from his Tomb, and at who&s;e Re&s;urrection many that &s;lept aro&s;e,&mdash;rai&s;e us al&s;o by his quickening Spirit from our natural Death, in which we have &s;o long lain, to a holy and heavenly Life.</P>
<P>We might think our&s;elves happy, if we had &s;een the HOLY JESUS after He was ri&s;en from the Dead, and our Hands handled that LORD of Life. But more happy are they who have not &s;een him, and yet having felt the Power of his Re&s;urrection, therefore believe in Him.&mdash;For many &s;aw our Divine Ma&s;ter, who were not &s;aved by him; but who&s;oever has thus felt the Power of his Re&s;urrection, he has the Earne&s;t of his Inheritance in his Heart, he has pa&s;&s;ed from Death to Life, and &s;hall never, if he &s;till &s;tir up the Gift of GOD that is in him, fall into Condemnation.</P>
<P>I am very &s;en&s;ible that this is Fooli&s;hne&s;s to the Natural Man, as were many &s;uch like Truths to our LORD's own Di&s;ciples before he ro&s;e again. But when the&s;e natural Men, like them, have

<P>And Oh that all Unbelievers, all Letter-learned Ma&s;ters of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> who now look upon the Doctrine of the Power of CHRIST'S Re&s;ur|rection, or our New Birth, as an idle Tale, and condemn the Preachers of it as Enthu&s;ia&s;ts and Madmen, did but thus feel the Power of it in their Souls,&mdash;They would no longer ask, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> this Thing could be?&mdash;But they would be con|vinced of it as much as <HI>Thomas</HI> was when he &s;aw the LORD's CHRIST; and like him, when JESUS bid him reach out his Hands and thru&s;t into his Side, in a holy Confu&s;ion they would cry out <HI>My LORD and my GOD!</HI></P>

<P>This, this is the Way, walk in it.&mdash;This do, and ye &s;hall live.

But then by this Faith we are to under&s;tand not a dead &s;peculative Faith, a Faith in the Head; but a living Principle wrought in the Heart by the powerful Operations of the Holy Gho&s;t,&mdash;A Faith that will enable us to overcome the World, and for&s;ake all in Affection for JESUS CHRIST. For thus &s;peaks our Ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter, <HI>Unle&s;s a Man for&s;ake all that he hath, he cannot be my Di&s;ciple.</HI></P>

<P>If we can reconcile Light and Darkne&s;s, Heaven and Hell, then we may hope to know the Power of CHRIST'S Re&s;urrection without dying to our&s;elves and the World.&mdash;But till we can do this, we might as well expect that CHRIST will have Concord with <HI>Belial.</HI></P>

<P>GOD is LOVE; and therefore could our own Wills, or the World have made us happy, he never would have &s;ent his own dear Son JESUS CHRIST to die and ri&s;e again, to deliver us from the Power of them.&mdash;But becau&s;e they only torment, but cannot &s;atisfy, therefore GOD bids renounce them.</P>

<P>But how few copy after the Example of CHRIST? How many are there, who do not regard the Word of GOD at all, but throw the Sacred Oracles a&s;ide, as an antiquated Book, fit only for unlearned and illiterate Men?</P>

<P>By the Scriptures I under&s;tand the Law and the Prophets, and all tho&s;e Books which have in all Ages been accounted Canonical, and which make up that Book commonly called, <HI>The Bible.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are emphatically &s;tiled <HI>The Scriptures,</HI> and in one Place, <HI>The Scriptures of Truth,</HI> as though no other Books de&s;erved the Name of true Writings or Scriptures in Compari&s;on of them.</P>
<P>They are not of any private Interpretation, Authority, or Invention, but Holy Men of old wrote them, as they were moved by the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="004650_0282_100DDD4C82C3EA90">
The Foundation of GOD's revealing him&s;elf thus to Mankind, was our Fall in <HI>Adam,</HI> and the Nece&s;&s;ity of our <HI>New Birth</HI> in CHRIST JESUS. And if we &s;earch the Scriptures as we ought, we &s;hall find the Sum and Sub&s;tance, the <HI>Alpha</HI> and <HI>Omega,</HI> the Beginning and End of them, has no other Tendency but to lead us to a Knowledge of the&s;e two great Truths.</P>
<P>All the Threats, Promi&s;es, and Precepts, all the Exhortations and Doctrines contained there|in, all the Rites, and Ceremonies, and Sacrifices appointed under the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Law; nay, almo&s;t all the Hi&s;torical Parts of Holy Scripture, &s;up|po&s;e our being fallen in <HI>Adam,</HI> and either point out to us a Mediator to come, or &s;peak of him as already come in the Fle&s;h.</P>
<P>Had Man continued in a State of Innocence, he would not have needed an outward Revela|tion, becau&s;e the Law of GOD was &s;o deeply written in the Tables of his Heart. But having eaten of the forbidden Fruit, he incurred the Divine Di&s;plea&s;ure, and lo&s;t the Divine Image, and therefore without an outward Re|velation could never tell how GOD would be reconciled unto him, or how he &s;hould be &s;aved from the Mi&s;ery and Darkne&s;s of his fallen Nature.</P>
<P>That the&s;e Truths are &s;o, I need not refer you to any other Book than that of your own Hearts.</P>
<P>For unle&s;s we are fallen Creatures, whence come tho&s;e abominable Corruptions which daily ari&s;e in our Hearts? We could not come thus
<PB N="53" REF="004650_0283_100DDD4F600B8978">
corrupt out of the Hands of our Maker, becau&s;e he being Goodne&s;s it&s;elf, could make nothing but what is like him&s;elf&punc; Holy, Ju&s;t and Good. And that we want to be delivered from the&s;e Di&s;orders of our Nature is evident, becau&s;e we find an Unwillingne&s;s within our|&s;elves to own we are thus depraved, and are always &s;triving to appear to others of a quite different Frame and Temper of Mind, than what we are.</P>
<P>I appeal to the Experience of the mo&s;t learned Di&s;puter again&s;t Divine Revelation, whether he does not find in him&s;elf that he is naturally Proud, Angry, Revengeful, and full of other Tempers contrary to the Purity, Holine&s;s, and Long-Suffering of GOD.&mdash;And is not this a demon&s;trable Proof that &s;ome Way or other he is fallen from GOD?&mdash;And I appeal al&s;o whether at the &s;ame Time he finds the&s;e Helli&s;h Tempers in his Heart, he does not &s;trive to &s;eem Amiable, Courteous, Kind, and Affable; and is not this as manife&s;t a Proof that he is &s;en&s;ible that he is Mi&s;erable, and wants he knows not how, to be redeemed or delivered from it?</P>
<P>Here then GOD by his Word &s;teps in, and opens to his View &s;uch a Scene of Divine Love, and infinite Goodne&s;s, in the Holy Scriptures, that none but Men of &s;uch corrupt and reprobate Minds as our modern Dei&s;ts, would &s;hut their Eyes again&s;t it.</P>
<P>For what does GOD in his written Word do more or le&s;s, than &s;hew thee, O Man, how
<PB N="54" REF="004650_0284_100DDD52070D11A8">
thou art fallen into that Blindne&s;s, Darkne&s;s, and Mi&s;ery thou feele&s;t and complaine&s;t of? And at the &s;ame Time points out the Way to what thou de&s;ire&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> How thou may&s;t be redeemed out of it,&mdash;by believing in, and copying after the Son of his Love.</P>
<P>For, as I told you before, &s;o I tell you again, upon the&s;e two Truths hangs all Divine Revelation. It being given us for no other End but to &s;hew us our Mi&s;ery, and our Happine&s;s; our Fall and Recovery; or, in one Word, after what Manner we died in <HI>Adam,</HI> and how in CHRIST, we may again be made alive.</P>
<P>Hence then ari&s;es the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;earching the Scriptures. For &s;ince they are nothing el&s;e but the grand Character of our Salvation, a Revelation of a Covenant made by GOD with Man in CHRIST, a Light to guide them into the Way of Peace: It follows, that all are obliged to read and &s;earch them, becau&s;e all are equally fallen from GOD, all equally &s;tand in need of being informed what they mu&s;t do to be re&s;tored to, and again united with him.</P>
<P>How fooli&s;hly then do the di&s;puting Infidels of this Generation act, who are continually either calling for Signs from Heaven, or &s;eeking for outward Evidence to prove the Truth of Divine Revelation? Whereas what they &s;o earne&s;tly &s;eek for is nigh unto, nay, within them.

<P>For who&s;oever does not read them with this Temper &s;hall in no wi&s;e enter into the Know|ledge of the Things contained therein.

<P>Fancy your&s;elves therefore when you are &s;earching the Scriptures, e&s;pecially when you are reading the New Te&s;tament, to be with <HI>Mary</HI> &s;itting at the Feet of the HOLY JESUS, and be as willing to learn what GOD &s;hall teach You, as <HI>Samuel</HI> was, when he &s;aid, <HI>Speak, LORD, for thy Servant heareth.</HI></P>

exalts it&s;elf again&s;t the Revealed Will of GOD! Oh that they would, like new-born Babes, de&s;ire to be fed with the pure Milk of the Word! then we &s;hould have them no longer &s;coffing at Divine Revelation, nor would they read the Bible any more (with the &s;ame Intent the <HI>Phili&s;tines</HI> brought out <HI>Samp&s;on</HI>) to make Sport at it, but they would &s;ee the Divine Image and Super&s;cription written upon every Line of it.

<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Search the Scriptures with a &s;incere Intention to put in Practice what you read.</P>
<P>For a De&s;ire to do the Will of GOD is the only Way to know it, <HI>If any Man will do my Will,</HI> &s;ays JESUS CHRIST, <HI>He &s;hall know of my Doctrine whether it he of GOD, or whether I &s;peak of my&s;elf.</HI> As he al&s;o &s;peaks in another Place to his Di&s;ciples, <HI>To you,</HI> who are willing to practice your Duty, <HI>it is given to know the My&s;teries of the Kingdom of GOD; but to tho&s;e that are without,</HI> who only want to rai&s;e Cavils again&s;t my Doctrine, <HI>all the&s;e Things are &s;poken in Parables, that &s;eeing they may &s;ee and not under&s;tand, and hearing they may hear and not perceive.</HI></P>

To tho&s;e who de&s;ire to know from his Word, who he is that they may believe on and live by and to him, he will reveal him&s;elf as clearly as he did to the Woman of <HI>Samaria,</HI> when he &s;aid, <HI>I that &s;peak to thee am he;</HI> or as he did to the Man that was born blind, whom the <HI>Jews</HI> had ca&s;t out for his Name's &s;ake, <HI>He that talketh with thee is he.</HI> But to tho&s;e who con&s;ult his Word with a De&s;ire neither to know him or keep his Commandments, but either merely for their Entertainment, or to &s;coff at the Simplicity of the Manner in which he is revealed, to tho&s;e, I &s;ay, he never will reveal him&s;elf, though he &s;hould &s;earch the Scriptures to all Eternity.&mdash;As he never would tell tho&s;e whether he was the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> or not, who put that Que&s;tion to him either out of Curio&s;ity, or that they might have whereof to accu&s;e him.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> In order to &s;earch the Scriptures &s;till more effectually, make an Application of every Thing you read to your own Hearts.</P>
<P>For whatever was written in the Book of GOD, was written for our Learning. And what CHRIST &s;aid unto tho&s;e aforetime, we mu&s;t look upon as &s;poken to us al&s;o: For &s;ince the Holy Scriptures are nothing but a Revelation from GOD, how fallen Man is to be re&s;tored by JESUS CHRIST, all the Precepts, Threats and Promi&s;es, belong to us and to our Children, as well as to tho&s;e to whom they were immediately made known.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="004650_0289_100DDD5ED354E210">
Thus the Apo&s;tle, when he tells us that <HI>he lived by the Faith of the Son of</HI> GOD, adds <HI>who died and gave him&s;elf for me,</HI> For it is this Application of JESUS CHRIST to our Hearts that makes his Redemption effectual to each of us.</P>
<P>And it is this Application of all the Doctrinal and Hi&s;torical Parts of Scripture, when we are reading them over, that mu&s;t render them profi|table to us, as they were de&s;igned for Reproof, for Correction, for In&s;truction in Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and make every Child of GOD perfect, thoroughly furni&s;hed to every good Work.</P>
<P>And I dare appeal to the Experience of every Spiritual Reader of Holy Writ, whether or no if he con&s;ulted the Word of GOD in this Manner, he was not at all Times and at all Sea&s;ons as plainly directed how to act, as though he had con&s;ulted the <HI>Urim</HI> and <HI>Thummim</HI> which was upon the <HI>High Prie&s;t'</HI>s Brea&s;t.</P>
<P>For this is the Way GOD now reveals him&s;elf to Man: Not by making new Revelations, but by applying general Things that are revealed already, to every particular &s;incere Reader's Heart.</P>
<P>And this, by the Way, an&s;wers an Objection made by tho&s;e that &s;ay, <Q>the Word of GOD is not a perfect Rule of Action, becau&s;e it can|not direct us how to act, or how to determine in particular Ca&s;es, or what Place to go to when we are in Doubt, and therefore the Spirit, and not the Word, is to be our Rule of Action.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="004650_0290_100DDD62371FCD18">
But this I deny, and affirm on the Contrary, that GOD at all Times, Circum&s;tances and Places, though never &s;o minute, never &s;o particular, will, if we diligently &s;eek the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Holy Spirit, apply general Things to our Hearts, and thereby, to u&s;e the Words of the Holy JESUS, will lead us into all Truth, and give us the particular A&s;&s;i&s;tance we want: But this leads me to a</P>
<P><HI>Fifth</HI> Direction how to &s;earch the Scriptures with Profit. Labour to attain that Spirit by which they were wrote.</P>
<P>For the natural Man di&s;cerneth not the Words of the Spirit of GOD, becau&s;e they are &s;piritually di&s;cerned, the Words that CHRIST hath &s;poken they are Spirit, and they are Life, and can be no more under&s;tood, as to the true hidden Sen&s;e and Meaning of them, by the mere natural Man, than a Per&s;on who had never learnt a Language can under&s;tand another &s;peaking in it. The Scriptures therefore have not unfitly been com|par'd by &s;ome to the Cloud which went before the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> they are dark and hard to be under&s;tood by the natural Man, as the Cloud appeared dark to the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> but they are Light, they are Life to Chri&s;tians indeed, as that &s;ame Cloud which &s;eem'd dark to <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Ho&s;t, appeared bright and altogether glorious to the <HI>I&s;rael</HI> of GOD.</P>
<P>It was the Want of the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of this Spirit that made <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> a Teacher of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> Ruler of the <HI>Jews,</HI> &s;o utterly ignorant in the Doctrine of <HI>Regeneration:</HI> For being only a natural Man.
<PB N="61" REF="004650_0291_100DDD63BAE54D10">
he could not tell how that Thing could be. It was the Want of this Spirit that made our Saviour's Di&s;ciples, tho' he &s;o frequently conver&s;ed with them, daily mi&s;take the Nature of the Doctrines he delivered; and it is becau&s;e the natural Veil is not taken off from their Hearts, that &s;o many who pretend to &s;earch the Scriptures, yet &s;ee no farther than into the bare Letter of them and continue entire Strangers to the hidden Sen&s;e, the Spiritual Meaning, couched under every Parable, and contained in almo&s;t all the Precepts of the Book of GOD.</P>
<P>And indeed how &s;hould it be otherwi&s;e; for GOD being a Spirit, he cannot communicate him&s;elf any otherwi&s;e than in a &s;piritual Manner to the Hearts of Men; and con&s;equently i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> we are Strangers to his Spirit, we mu&s;t continue Strangers to his Word, becau&s;e it is altogether like him&s;elf Spiritual. Labour therefore ear|ne&s;tly to attain this ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, for otherwi&s;e your Under&s;tandings will never be opened to under&s;tand the Scriptures aright; and becau&s;e Prayer is one of the mo&s;t immediate Means to get his Holy Spirit,</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> Let me advi&s;e you before you read the Scripture, to pray that CHRIST, according to his Promi&s;e, would &s;end his Spirit to guide you into all Truth; inter&s;per&s;e &s;hort Ejaculations whil&s;t you are engaged in Reading, pray over every Word and Ver&s;e if po&s;&s;ible, and when you clo&s;e up the Book mo&s;t earne&s;tly be&s;eech GOD, that the Words which you then have read <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> be inwardly engrafted into your
<PB N="62" REF="004650_0292_100DDD6689DF6F70">
Hearts, and bring forth in you the Fruits of Good Living.</P>
<P>Do this, and you will with an holy Violence draw down GOD's Holy Spirit into your Hearts, and you will experience his gracious Influences, and feel him enlightning, quickening and inflam|ing your Souls by the Word of GOD; you will then not only read, but mark, learn, and inwardly dige&s;t what you read, and the Word of GOD will be Meat indeed and Drink indeed unto your Souls; you then will be as <HI>Apollos</HI> was, powerful in the Scriptures, be <HI>Scribes</HI> ready in&s;tructed to the Kingdom of GOD, and bring out of the good Trea&s;ures of your Heart, Things both from the Old and New Te&s;tament, to entertain all you conver&s;e with.</P>
<P>One Direction more; which &s;hall be the la&s;t, <HI>Seventhly,</HI> Read the Scripture con&s;tantly, or to u&s;e our Saviour's Expre&s;&s;ion in the Text, <HI>Search the Scriptures,</HI> dig in them as for hid Trea&s;ure, for here's a manife&s;t Allu&s;ion to tho&s;e who dig in Mines, and our Saviour would thereby teach us that we mu&s;t take as much Pains in con&s;tantly reading his Word, if we would grow thereby, as tho&s;e who dig for Gold and Silver. The Scriptures contain the Deep Things of GOD, and there|fore can never be &s;ufficiently &s;earch'd into by a carele&s;s, &s;uperficial, cur&s;ory Way of Reading them, but by an indu&s;trious, clo&s;e and humble Application.</P>
<P>The P&s;almi&s;t therefore makes it the Property of a good Man that he meditates on GOD's Law Day and Night: <HI>And this Book of the Law,</HI>
<PB N="63" REF="004650_0293_100DD7989BF29A20">

<Q><HI>Le&s;t Satan &s;hould get an Advantage over us; for we are not ignorant of his Devices.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Occa&s;ion of the&s;e Words was as fol|lows: In the Church of <HI>Corinth</HI> there was an unhappy Per&s;on, who had committed &s;uch Ince&s;t, as was not &s;o much as named among the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> in taking his Father's Wife; but either on account of his Wealth, Power, or &s;ome &s;uch Rea&s;ons, like many notorious Offender<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> now-a-days, had not been expo&s;ed to the Cen&s;ures of the Church. St. <HI>Paul</HI> therefore, in his fir&s;t Epi&s;tle, &s;everely chides them for this Neglect of Di&s;cipline, and commands them in the Name of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, <HI>When they were ga|thered together, to deliver &s;uch a one,</HI> whoever he was, <HI>to</HI> Satan, <HI>for the De&s;truction of the Fle&s;h, that his Spirit might be &s;aved in the Day of the LORD;</HI> that is, in one Word, that they &s;hould &s;olemnly excommunicate him; which was com|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> attended with &s;ome bodily Di&s;ea&s;e in|flicted
<PB N="66" REF="004650_0296_100DDD6F82469C70">
by the Devil, under who&s;e Power the ex|communicated Per&s;on was for &s;ome Time de|livered. The <HI>Corinthians,</HI> being obedient to the Apo&s;tle, as dear Children, no &s;ooner received this Reproof, but they &s;ubmitted to it, and ca&s;t the offending Party out of the Church. But whil&s;t they were endeavouring to amend one Fault, they unhapply run into another; and as they formerly had been too mild and remi&s;s, &s;o now they behaved towards him with too much Severity and Re&s;entment. The Apo&s;tle there|fore, in this Chapter, reproves this, and tells them, that &s;ufficient to the Offender's Shame, was <HI>The Puni&s;hment which had been inflicted of many;</HI> that he had now &s;uffered enough; and that therefore, le&s;t he &s;hould be tempted to &s;ay with <HI>Cain My Puni&s;hment is greater than I can bear;</HI> or to u&s;e the Apo&s;tle's own Words, <HI>Le&s;t he &s;hould be &s;wallowed up with over much Sor|row;</HI> they ought, now he had given Proof of his Repentance, to forgive him, to confirm their Love towards him, and &s;o re&s;tore him in the Spirit of Meekne&s;s; <HI>Le&s;t Satan,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>to who&s;e Buffetings he was now given, &s;hould, by tempting him to De&s;pair, get an Advantage over us;</HI> and &s;o, by repre&s;enting you as Mercile&s;s and Cruel, cau&s;e that Holy Name to be bla&s;phemed by which you are called; <HI>for we are not igno|rant of his Devices:</HI> we know very well how many &s;ubtle Ways he has to draw a&s;ide and be|guile unguarded unthinking Men.</P>
<P>Thus then &s;tand the Words in Relation to the Context; but as Satan has many Devices, as
<PB N="67" REF="004650_0297_100DDD7485D57C08">
his Quiver is full of other poi&s;onous Darts, be|&s;ides tho&s;e which he &s;hoots at us to drive us to De&s;pair, I &s;hall con&s;ider them by them&s;elves, and in the following Di&s;cour&s;e &s;hall,

</LIST></P>
<P>The Word Satan, in its original Signification, means an Adver&s;ary; and in its general Accep|tation, is made u&s;e of to point out to us the Chief of the Devils, who, for &s;triving to be as GOD, was ca&s;t down from Heaven, and is now per|mitted, <HI>with the Re&s;t of his &s;piritual Wicked|ne&s;&s;es in high Places, to walk up and down, &s;eek|ing whom he may devour.</HI> We hear of him im|mediately after the Creation, when in the Shape of a Serpent he lay in wait to deceive our fir&s;t Parents.&mdash;He is called Satan in the Book of <HI>Job;</HI> wherein we are told, that <HI>when the Sons of GOD came to pre&s;ent them&s;elves before the LORD, Satan al&s;o came among&s;t them.</HI>&mdash;As the Scripture al&s;o &s;peaketh in the Book of <HI>Chronicles, and Satan moved</HI> David <HI>to number the People.&mdash;</HI> In the New-Te&s;tament he goes under different Denominations; &s;ometimes he is called the <HI>Evil One,</HI> becau&s;e he is evil in him&s;elf, and tempts us to Evil.&mdash;Sometimes, <HI>the Prince of the Power of the Air, and the Spirit that now ruleth in the Children of Di&s;obedience,</HI> becau&s;e he re&s;ides chiefly in the Air; and the whole World, <HI>i. e.</HI>
<PB N="68" REF="004650_0298_100DDE4BB71F57E8">
All that are not born of GOD, are &s;aid to lie in him.</P>
<P>He is an Enemy to GOD and Goodne&s;s&mdash;He is a Hater of all Truth; why el&s;e did he &s;lander GOD in Paradice? Why did he tell <HI>Eve, You &s;hall not &s;urely die?</HI> And why did he promi&s;e to give all the Kingdoms of the World, and the Glories of them, to JESUS CHRIST, if he would fall down and wor&s;hip him?</P>
<P>He is full of Malice, Envy and Revenge; for what other Motives could induce him to mole&s;t innocent Man in Paradice? And why is he &s;till &s;o Re&s;tle&s;s in his Attempts to de&s;troy us, who have done him no Wrong?</P>
<P>He is a Being of great Power, as appears in his being able to act on the Imagination of our Ble&s;|&s;ed LORD, &s;o as to repre&s;ent to him all the Kingdoms of the World, and the Glories of them, in a Moment of Time. As al&s;o in carrying his &s;acred Body through the Air up to a Pinnacle of the Temple; and his driving a Herd of Swine &s;o furiou&s;ly into the Deep&mdash;Nay, &s;o great is his Might, that, I doubt not, was GOD to let him u&s;e his full Strength, he could turn the Earth up&s;ide down, or pull the Sun from its Orb.</P>
<P>But what he is mo&s;t remarkable for is, <HI>his Subtlety;</HI> for not having Power given from above to take us by Force, he is obliged to wait for Opportunities to betray us, and to catch us by Guile. He therefore made u&s;e of the Ser|pent, which was &s;ubtle above all the Bea&s;ts of the Field, in order to tempt our fir&s;t Parents;
<PB N="69" REF="004650_0299_100DD7B793AAF150">
and accordingly he is &s;aid, in the <HI>New Te&s;tament, To lie in wait to deceive;</HI> and here in the Words of the Text, the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>We are not igno|rant of his Devices;</HI> thereby implying, that we are more in Danger of being &s;educed by his Po|licy, than over-borne by his Power.</P>
<P>From this &s;hort De&s;cription of Satan, we may ea&s;ily judge who&s;e Children they are, who love to make a Lie, who &s;peak Evil and &s;lander their Neighbour, and who&s;e Hearts are full of Pride, Subtlety, Malice, Envy, Revenge and all Uncharitablene&s;s.&mdash;Surely they have <HI>Satan</HI> for their Father&mdash;For the Tempers of Satan they know; and the Works of Satan they do. But were they to &s;ee either them&s;elves, or Satan, as he is, they could not but be terrified at their own Likene&s;s, and abhor them&s;elves in Du&s;t and A&s;hes.</P>
<P>But to return. The Ju&s;tice of GOD in &s;uf|fering us to be tempted is vindicated from the&s;e Con&s;iderations&mdash;That we are here in a State of Probation&mdash;That he has promi&s;ed not to &s;uffer us to be tempted above what we are able to bear&mdash;And not only &s;o, but to him that overcometh, he will give a Crown of Life.</P>
<P>The Holy Angels them&s;elves, it &s;hould &s;eem, were once put to a Trial whether they would be faithful or not. The fir&s;t <HI>Adam,</HI> was tempted even in Paradice. And JESUS CHRIST, that &s;econd <HI>Adam,</HI> though he was a Son, yet was carried, as our Repre&s;entative, by the Holy Spirit into the Wilderne&s;s to be tempted of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.

Paradice among&s;t the Goodly Fellow&s;hip of the Prophets, the glorious Company of the Apo&s;tles, the noble Army of Martyrs, and the Spirits of ju&s;t Men made perfect, who, when on Earth, was not a&s;&s;aulted by the fiery Darts of that wicked one, <HI>the Devil.</HI></P>
<P>What then has been the common Lot of all GOD's children, of the Angels, nay, of the Eternal Son of GOD him&s;elf, we mu&s;t not think to be exempted from. No, 'tis &s;ufficient if we are made perfect through Temptations, as they were.&mdash;And therefore &s;ince we cannot but be tempted, unle&s;s we could unmake Human Na|ture, in&s;tead of repining at our Condition, we &s;hould rather be enquiring, at what Time of our Lives Satan mo&s;t violently a&s;&s;aults us? And what tho&s;e Devices are, which he com|monly makes u&s;e of, in order <HI>to get an Advantage over us?</HI></P>
<P>As the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Que&s;tion, I an&s;wer, we mu&s;t expect to be tempted by him, in &s;ome Degree or other, all our Lives long.&mdash;For this Life being a continual Warfare, we mu&s;t never ex|pect to have Re&s;t from our Spiritual Adver&s;ary, the Devil; or to &s;ay, our Combat with him is fini&s;hed, till, with our ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter, we bow down our Heads, and give up the Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>But &s;ince the Time of our Conver&s;ion, or fir&s;t entring upon the Spiritual Life, is the mo&s;t critical Time at which he mo&s;t violently be&s;ets us, as well knowing, if he can prevent our &s;etting out, he can lead us Captive at his Will; and &s;ince the wi&s;e Son of <HI>Sirach</HI> particularly

<P>But before I proceed to do this, let me ob|&s;erve to you, that what&s;oever &s;hall be delivered in the following Di&s;cour&s;e is only de&s;igned for &s;uch as have actually entred upon the Divine Life; and not for carnal almo&s;t Chri&s;tians, who have the Form of Godline&s;s, but never yet felt the Power of it in their Hearts. This being premi&s;ed;</P>
<P>The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Device I &s;hall mention which <HI>Satan</HI> makes u&s;e of, is, <HI>to drive us to De&s;pair.</HI></P>
<P>When GOD the Father awakens a Sinner by the Terrors of the Law, and by his Holy Spirit convinceth him of Sin, in order to lead him to CHRIST, and &s;hew him the Nece&s;&s;ity of a Redeemer; then <HI>Satan</HI> generally &s;trikes in, and aggravates tho&s;e Convictions to &s;uch a Degree, as to make the Sinner doubt of finding Mercy through the Mediator.</P>
<P>Thus, in all his Temptations of the Holy JESUS, he chiefly aimed to make him que&s;tion, whether he was the Son of GOD? <HI>If thou be the Son of GOD,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>do &s;o and &s;o.</HI> With many &s;uch de&s;ponding Thoughts, no doubt, he

filled the Heart of the great St. <HI>Paul,</HI> when he continued three Days neither eating Bread or drinking Water; and therefore he &s;peaks by Experience, when he &s;ays, in the Words of the Text, <HI>We are not ignorant of his Devices,</HI> how he will endeavour to drive the ince&s;tuous Per&s;on to De&s;pair.</P>
<P>But let not any of you be influenced by him to de&s;pair of &s;inding Mercy. For it is not the Greatne&s;s or Number of our Crimes, but Impenitence and Unbelief, that will prove our Ruin: No, <HI>were our Sins more in Number than the Hairs of our Head, or of a deeper Die than the brighte&s;t Scarlet; yet the Merits of the Death of</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>are infinitely greater, and Faith in his Blood &s;hall make them white as Snow.</HI></P>
<P>An&s;wer always therefore his de&s;pairing Sug|ge&s;tions, as your Ble&s;&s;ed LORD did, with an <HI>It is written.</HI> Tell him, you know that your Redeemer liveth, ever to make Interce&s;&s;ion for you; that the LORD hath received from him double for all your Crimes: And tho' you have &s;inned much, that is no Rea&s;on why you &s;hould de&s;pair, but only why you &s;hould love much, having &s;o much forgiven.</P>
<P>Another Device that <HI>Satan</HI> generally makes u&s;e of, <HI>to get an Advantage over young Converts,</HI> is, to tempt them to pre&s;ume, and to think more highly of them&s;elves than they ought to think.</P>
<P>When a Per&s;on has for &s;ome little Time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;ted the good Word of Life, and felt the
<PB N="73" REF="004650_0303_100DD7D567EFA5E8">
Powers of the World to come, he is commonly (as indeed well he may) mo&s;t highly tran&s;ported with that &s;udden Change he finds in him&s;elf. But then, <HI>Satan</HI> will not be wanting at &s;uch a Time, to puff him up with a high Conceit of his own Attainments, as if he was &s;ome great Per&s;on; and will tempt him to &s;et at nought his Brethren, as though he was holier than they.</P>
<P>Take heed therefore, and let us beware of this Device of our &s;piritual Adver&s;ary; for as before Honour is Humility, &s;o a haughty Spirit generally goes before a Fall; and GOD is obliged, when under &s;uch Circum&s;tances, to &s;end us &s;ome humbling Vi&s;itation, or permit us to fall, as he did <HI>Peter,</HI> into &s;ome grievous Sin, that we may learn not to be too high minded.</P>
<P>To check therefore all Sugge&s;tions to Spiritual Pride, let us con&s;ider, that we did not apprehend CHRIST, but were apprehended of him.&mdash;That we have nothing but what we have received.&mdash;That the free Grace of GOD has alone made the Difference between us and others; and, was GOD to leave us to the Deceitfulne&s;s of our own Hearts but one Moment, we &s;hould become weak and wicked, like other Men.&mdash;We &s;hould farther con&s;ider, that being proud of Grace, is the mo&s;t ready Way to lo&s;e it.&mdash;For GOD re&s;i&s;teth the Proud, and giveth more Grace only to the Humble. And were we endowed with the Perfections of <HI>Seraphims;</HI> yet if we were proud of tho&s;e Perfections, they would but render us more accompli&s;hed Devils.
<PB N="74" REF="004650_0304_100DD7D6F9505530">
&mdash;Above all, we &s;hould pray earne&s;tly to Almighty GOD, that we may learn of JESUS CHRIST, to be lowly in Heart. That his Grace, through the Subtlety and Deceivablene&s;s of <HI>Satan,</HI> may not be our Poi&s;on. But that we may always think &s;oberly of our&s;elves, as we ought to think.</P>
<P>A <HI>third</HI> Device I &s;hall mention, which <HI>Satan</HI> generally makes u&s;e of <HI>to get an Advantage over <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s,</HI> is to tempt us to Unea&s;ine&s;s, and to have hard Thoughts of GOD, when we are under Deadne&s;s and Dryne&s;s in Prayer.</P>
<P>Though this is a Term not under&s;tood by the Natural Man; yet, who&s;oever there are among&s;t you, who have pa&s;&s;ed through the Pangs of the <HI>New Birth,</HI> they know full well what I mean, when I talk of Deadne&s;s and Dryne&s;s in Prayer. And, I doubt not, but many of you, among&s;t whom I am now preaching the King|dom of GOD, are at this very Time labouring under it.</P>
<P>For when Per&s;ons are fir&s;t awakened to the Divine Life, becau&s;e Grace is weak and Nature &s;trong, GOD is often plea&s;ed to vouch&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e them &s;ome extraordinary Illuminations of his Holy Spirit; but when they are grown to be more perfect Men in CHRIST, then he frequently &s;eems to leave them to them&s;elves; and not only &s;o, but permits a horrible Deadne&s;s and Dread to overwhelm them; at which Times <HI>Satan</HI> will not be wanting to vex and tempt them to Impatience, to the great Di&s;comfort of their Souls.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="004650_0305_100DD7D8C7F88ED0">
But be not afraid; for this in no more than your Ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Lamb of GOD, has underwent before you: Witne&s;s his bitter Agony in the Garden, when his Soul was exceeding Sorrowful, even unto Death.&mdash;When he &s;weat great Drops of Blood, falling on the Ground; when the Sen&s;e of the Divinity was withdrawn from him; and <HI>Satan,</HI> in all Probability, was permitted, to &s;et all his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in Array before him.</P>
<P>Rejoice therefore, my Brethren, when you fall into the like Circum&s;tances; as knowing, that you are therein Partakers of the Sufferings of JESUS CHRIST.&mdash;Con&s;ider, that it is nece&s;&s;ary &s;uch inward Trials &s;hould come, to wean us off the Love of &s;en&s;ible Devotion, and to teach us to follow CHRIST, not merely for his Loaves, but out of a Principle of Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e and Obedience.&mdash;In Patience therefore po&s;&s;e&s;s your Souls, and be not terrified by <HI>Satan'</HI>s Sugge&s;tions.&mdash;Still per&s;evere in &s;eeking JESUS in the U&s;e of Means, though it be Sorrowing, and though through Benumne&s;s and Bar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">enne&s;s of Soul you may go mourning all the Day long.&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that the Spou&s;e is with you, though behind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Curtain; as he was with <HI>Mary,</HI> at the Sepul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> though &s;he knew it not.&mdash;That he has wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|drawn but for a little while, to make his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> more welcome.&mdash;That though he may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;eem to frown and look back on you, as he did on the <HI>Syrophoenician</HI> Woman; yet if you like her, cry out &s;o much the more earne&s;tly, <HI>JESUS, thou Son of</HI> David, <HI>have Mercy on us</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

<P>But among&s;t all the Devices, that <HI>Satan</HI> makes u&s;e of <HI>to get an Advantage over us,</HI> there is none in which he is more &s;ucce&s;sful, or by which he grieves the Children of GOD wor&s;e, than that</P>
<P><HI>Fourth</HI> Device I am going to mention, <HI>viz.</HI> His troubling you with bla&s;phemous, prophane, impious, unbelieving Thoughts; and &s;ometimes to &s;uch a Degree, that they are as tormenting as the Rack.</P>
<P>Some indeed are apt to impute all &s;uch evil Thoughts to a Di&s;order of Body.&mdash;But tho&s;e, who know any Thing of the Spiritual Life, can inform you with greater Certainty, that for the Generality, they proceed from that wicked One, <HI>the Devil&punc;</HI> who, no doubt, has Power given him from above, as well now as formerly, to di&s;order the Body, as he did <HI>Job'</HI>s; that he may, with the more Secrecy and Succe&s;s work upon, ruffle and torment the Soul.</P>
<P>You that have felt his fiery Darts, can &s;ub&s;cribe to the Truth of this, and by fatal Experience can tell, how often he has bid you, <HI>Cur&s;e GOD and die,</HI> and darted into your Thoughts a Thou&s;and bla&s;phemous Sugge&s;tions, even in your mo&s;t &s;ecret and &s;olemn Retirements; the bare looking back on which makes your very Hearts to tremble.</P>
<P>I appeal to your own Con&s;ciences; have not &s;ome of you, when you have been lifting up
<PB N="77" REF="004650_0307_100DD7E0222852E0">
Holy Hands in Prayer, been pe&s;tered with &s;uch a Croud of the mo&s;t horrid In&s;inuations, that you have been often tempted to ri&s;e off from your Knees, and been made believe your Prayers were an Abomination to the LORD? Nay, when, with the Re&s;t of your Chri&s;tian Brethren, you have crouded round the Holy Table, and taken the &s;acred Symbols of CHRIST'S mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed Body and Blood into your Hands, in&s;tead of remembring the Death of your Saviour, have you not been employed in driving out evil Thoughts, as <HI>Abraham</HI> was in driving away the Birds, that came to devour his Sacrifice; and thereby been terrified, le&s;t you have eat and drank your own Damnation?</P>
<P>But marvel not, as though &s;ome &s;trange Thing happened unto you; for this has been the common Lot of all GOD's Children.&mdash;We read even in <HI>Job'</HI>s Time, <HI>That when the Sons of GOD came to appear before their Maker,</HI> i. e. at public Wor&s;hip, <HI>Satan al&s;o came among&s;t them, to di&s;turb their Devotions.</HI></P>
<P>And think not that GOD is angry with you for the&s;e di&s;tracting, tho' ever &s;o bla&s;phemous Thoughts: No, he knows it is not you, but <HI>Satan</HI> working in you, and therefore, notwith|&s;tanding he may be di&s;plea&s;ed with, and certainly will puni&s;h him; yet he will both pity and reward you. And though it be difficult to make Per&s;ons in your Circum&s;tances to believe &s;o&punc; yet, I doubt not, but you are more acceptable to GOD, when performing your holy Duties in the mid&s;t of &s;uch involuntary Di&s;tractions,

than when you are wrapped up by &s;en&s;ible Devotion, as it were, into the third Heavens.&mdash;For you are then &s;uffering, as well as doing the Will of GOD at the &s;ame Time; and, like <HI>Nehemiah'</HI>s Servants at the Building of the Temple, are holding a Trowel in the one Hand, and a Sword in the other.&mdash;But be not you driven from the U&s;e of any Ordinance whatever, on account of tho&s;e abominable Sugge&s;tions; for then you let <HI>Satan</HI> get his de&s;ired Advantage over you; it being his chief De&s;ign, by the&s;e Thoughts, to make you fall out with the Means of Grace; and to tempt you to believe, you do not plea&s;e GOD, for no other Rea&s;on, than becau&s;e you do not plea&s;e your&s;elves.&mdash;Rather per&s;evere in the U&s;e of the Holy Com|munion e&s;pecially, and all other Means what|ever; and when the&s;e Temptations have wrought that Re&s;ignation in you, for which they were permitted, GOD will vi&s;it you with fre&s;h Tokens of his Love, as he met <HI>Abraham,</HI> when he returned from the Slaughter of the five Kings; and will &s;end an Angel from Heaven, as he did to his Son, on Purpo&s;e to &s;trengthen you.</P>
<P>Hitherto we have only ob&s;erved &s;uch Devices as <HI>Satan</HI> makes u&s;e of immediately by him&s;elf; but there is a</P>
<P><HI>Fifth</HI> I &s;hall mention, that is not the lea&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> Tempting us by our carnal Friends and Relations.</P>
<P>This is one of the mo&s;t common, as well as mo&s;t artful Devices he makes u&s;e of to draw
<PB N="79" REF="004650_0309_100DDD789FA76C90">
young Converts from GOD; for when he cannot prevail over them by him&s;elf, he will try what he can do by the Influence and Mediation of others.</P>
<P>Thus he tempted <HI>Eve,</HI> that &s;he might tempt <HI>Adam.</HI>&mdash;Thus he &s;tirred up <HI>Job'</HI>s Wife, to bid him <HI>Cur&s;e GOD and die.</HI>&mdash;And thus he made u&s;e of <HI>Peter'</HI>s Tongue, to per&s;uade our Ble&s;&s;ed LORD <HI>To &s;pare him&s;elf,</HI> and thereby decline tho&s;e Sufferings, by which alone we could be pre&s;erved from &s;uffering the Vengeance of Eternal Fire. And thus, in the&s;e la&s;t Days, he often &s;tirs up our mo&s;t powerful Friends and deare&s;t Intimates, to di&s;&s;uade us from going in that narrow Way, which alone leadeth unto Life eternal,</P>
<P>But our Ble&s;&s;ed LORD has furni&s;hed us with a &s;ufficient An&s;wer to all &s;uch Sugge&s;tions.&mdash;<HI>Get you behind me, my Adver&s;aries;</HI> for otherwi&s;e they will be an Offence unto you; and the only Rea&s;on why they give &s;uch Advice is, becau&s;e they &s;avour not the Things that be of GOD, but the Things that be of Men.</P>
<P>Whoever therefore among you are re&s;olved to &s;erve the LORD, prep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">, your Souls for many &s;uch Temptations as tho&s;e; for it is nece&s;&s;ary that &s;uch Offences &s;hould come, to try your Sincerity, to teach us to cea&s;e from Man, and to &s;ee if we will for&s;ake all to follow CHRIST.</P>
<P>Indeed our Moderni&s;ers o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Chri&s;tianity would per&s;wade us, that the Go&s;pel was calculated
<PB N="80" REF="004650_0310_100DDD7B22296838">
only for about two hundred Years; and that now there is no need of hating Father and Mother, or being per&s;ecuted for the Sake of CHRIST and his Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>But &s;uch Per&s;ons err, not knowing the Scriptures, and the Power of Godline&s;s in their Hearts; for who&s;oever receives the Love of GOD in the Truth of it, will find, that CHRIST came to &s;end not Peace, but a Sword upon Earth, as much now as ever.&mdash;That the Father-in-law &s;hall be again&s;t the Daughter-in-law, in the&s;e latter, as well as in the primitive Times; and that if we will live godly in CHRIST JESUS, we mu&s;t, as then, &s;o now, from carnal Friends and Relations, &s;uffer Per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>But the Devil has another Device, as dangerous as any of the former,&mdash;<HI>i. e.</HI> by not tempting us at all, or rather by withdrawing him&s;elf for a while, in order to come upon us at an Hour when we think not of it.</P>
<P>Thus it is &s;aid, that he left JESUS CHRIST only for a Sea&s;on; and our Ble&s;&s;ed LORD has bid us to watch and pray always, that we enter not into Temptation; thereby im|plying, that Satan, whether we think of it or not, is always &s;eeking how he may devour us.</P>
<P>If we would therefore behave like good Soldiers of JESUS CHRIST, we mu&s;t be always upon our guard, and never pretend to lay down our &s;piritual Weapons of Prayer and Watching&punc; till our Warfare is accompli&s;hed
<PB N="81" REF="004650_0311_100DDD7DCC5F6B60">
by Death; for if we do, our &s;piritual <HI>Amaleck</HI> will quickly prevail again&s;t us. What if he has left us?

<P>Watch carefully therefore over thy Heart, O Chri&s;tian, and whenever thou perceive&s;t thy&s;elf to be falling into a &s;piritual Slumber, &s;ay to it, as CHRIST to his Di&s;ciples, <HI>Ari&s;e my Soul, why &s;leepe&s;t thou?</HI> Awake, awake&punc; put on Strength, watch and pray, or otherwi&s;e the <HI>Phili&s;tines</HI> will be upon thee, and lead thee whither thou would&s;t not.

<P>By JESUS CHRIST, we are to under&s;tand the <HI>Eternal Son of GOD.</HI> He is called JESUS, <HI>i. e.</HI> A <HI>Saviour,</HI> becau&s;e he was to &s;ave us from the Guilt and Power of our Sins; and, like <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> by whom he was remarkably typified, to lead GOD's Spiritual <HI>I&s;rael</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the Wil|derne&s;s of this World, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> heavenly <HI>Ca|naan,</HI> the promi&s;ed Inheritance of the Children of GOD.</P>

<P>The Foundation or fir&s;t Cau&s;e of his Suffer|ing, was our Fall in <HI>Adam,</HI> in whom, as the living Oracles of GOD declare, <HI>We all died, i. e.</HI> His Sin was imputed to us all.

<P>But he being left to his own free Will, eat of the forbidden Fruit, notwith&s;tanding GOD had told him, <HI>the Day in which he eat thereof, he &s;hould &s;urely die;</HI> and thereby he, with his whole Po&s;terity, in who&s;e Name he acted, be|came liable to the Wrath of GOD, and &s;unk in|to a &s;piritual Death.</P>

Some indeed, may plea&s;e them&s;elves in know|ing the World, others boa&s;t them&s;elves in the Knowledge of a Multitude of Languages; but could we &s;peak with the Tongue of Men and Angels, or did we know the Number of the Stars, and could call them all by their Names, yet, without this experimental Knowledge of JESUS CHRIST, <HI>and him crucified,</HI> it would profit us nothing.</P>
<P>The former, indeed, may procure us a little Honour, which cometh of Man; but the latter only can render us acceptable in the Sight of GOD: For, if we are ignorant of CHRIST, GOD will be to us a con&s;uming Fire.</P>
<P>CHRIST is Way, the Truth, and the Life; no one cometh to the Father but through him&mdash;He is the Lamb &s;lain from the Foundation of the World, and none ever were, or ever will be re|ceived up into Glory, but by an experimental Application of his Merits to their Hearts.</P>
<P>We might as well think to rebuild the Tower of <HI>Babel,</HI> or reach Heaven with our Hands, as to imagine to enter therein by any other Door than that of <HI>the Knowledge of</HI> JESUS CHRIST.</P>

The Author of the Words now before us, was a remarkable In&s;tance of this; never, per|haps, was a greater Scholar, in all what the World calls fine Learning, than he: For he was bred up at the Feet of <HI>Gamaliel,</HI> and profited in the Knowledge of Books, as well as in the <HI>Jew|i&s;h</HI> Religion, above many of his Equals, as ap|pears by the Language, Rhetorick, and Spirit of his Writings; and yet, when he came to know what it was to be a Chri&s;tian, <HI>He accounted all Things but Lo&s;s, &s;o he might win</HI> CHRIST.

<P>Hence then, appears the Folly of tho&s;e who &s;pend their whole Lives in heaping up other Knowledge; and in&s;tead of &s;earching the Scrip|tures, which te&s;tify of JESUS CHRIST, and are alone able to make them wi&s;e unto Salvation, di&s;quiet them&s;elves in a Pur&s;uit after the Know|ledge of &s;uch Things, as when known, concern them no more, than to know that a Bird drop|ped a Feather upon one of the <HI>Pyrenean</HI> Moun|tains.</P>

a Propitiation for our Sins, and a Principle of new Life to our Souls, they are quite ignorant of the whole Matter, and prove, to a Demon&s;tra|tion, that, with all their Learning, they know nothing yet as they ought to know.</P>
<P>But, good GOD! how mu&s;t it &s;urpri&s;e a Man, when the Mo&s;t High is about to take a|way his Soul, to think that he has pa&s;&s;ed for a wi&s;e Man, and a learned Di&s;puter in this World, and yet is left de&s;titute of that Knowledge which alone can make him appear with Boldne&s;s be|fore the Judgment-Seat of JESUS CHRIST?

<P>Well might the Apo&s;tle, in a holy Triumph cry out, <HI>Where is the Wi&s;e? Where is the Scribe? Where is the Di&s;puter of this World?</HI> For, GOD will then make fooli&s;h the Wi&s;dom of this World, and bring to nought the Wi&s;|dom of tho&s;e who were &s;o knowing in their own Eyes.</P>
<P>I made this Digre&s;&s;ion from the main Point before us, not to condemn or deny human Lite|rature, but to &s;hew, that it ought to be u&s;ed only in Subordination to divine&punc; and that a Chri&s;tian, if the holy Spirit guided the Pen of the Apo&s;tle when he wrote this Epi&s;tle, ought to &s;tudy no Books, but &s;uch as lead him into a farther

<P>And there is the more Rea&s;on for this, be|cau&s;e of the great Mi&s;chief the contrary Practice has done to the Church of GOD: For, what was it but this Learning, or rather this Igno|rance, that kept &s;o many of the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> from the &s;aving Knowledge of JESUS CHRIST?

<P>For did we give all our Goods to feed the Poor, and yet were de&s;titute of this Knowledge, it would profit us nothing.</P>
<P>This our Ble&s;&s;ed LORD him&s;elf intimates in the 25th of St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> where he tells tho&s;e that had been rich in good Works, <HI>That in as much as they did it unto one of the lea&s;t of his Brethren, they did it unto him.</HI> From whence we may plainly infer, that it is &s;eeing CHRIST in his Members, and do|ing good to them out of an experimental Knowledge of his Love to us, that alone will render our Alms-Deeds rewardable at the la&s;t Day.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> As neither our Acts of Piety nor Charity, &s;o neither will our civil nor moral Actions be acceptable to GOD without this experimental Knowledge of JESUS CHRIST.</P>

of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of GOD by Faith in CHRIST JESUS.</P>
<P>For though we grant, that Morality is a &s;ub|&s;tantial Part of Chri&s;tianity, and that CHRIST came not to de&s;troy, <HI>i. e.</HI> not to take off the Force of the moral Law, as a Rule of Action, but to explain, and &s;o fulfil it; yet we affirm, that our moral and civil Actions are now no farther acceptable in the Sight of GOD the Father, than as they proceed from a Principle of a new Nature, and an experimental Knowledge of, or vital Faith in his dear Son.</P>
<P>For the Death of JESUS CHRIST has turned our whole Lives into one continued Sacrifice; and whether we eat or drink, whether we pray to GOD, or do any Thing to Man, it mu&s;t all be done out of a Love for, and Knowledge of him who died and ro&s;e again, to render all, even our mo&s;t ordinary Deeds, acceptable in the Sight of GOD.</P>
<P>If we live by this Principle, if CHRIST be the <HI>Alpha</HI> and <HI>Omega</HI> of all our Actions, then our mo&s;t indifferent ones are accepta|ble Sacrifices; but if this Principle be want|ing, our mo&s;t pompous Services avail no|thing.

<P>Our civil Magi&s;trates have not been wanting to u&s;e the Power given them from above, for the Puni&s;hment and Re&s;traint of &s;uch evil Doings; and I wi&s;h it could be &s;aid this Plague of Drinking, by what they have done, had been &s;tayed among&s;t us.

For, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Drunkenne&s;s is a Sin which mu&s;t be highly di&s;plea&s;ing to GOD; becau&s;e it is an Abu&s;e of his good Creatures.</P>
<P>When GOD fir&s;t made Man, and had breathed into him the Breath of Life, he gave him Dominion over the Works of his Hands, and every Herb bearing Seed, and every Tree, in which was the Fruit of a Tree yielding Seed, to him it was given for Meat; but when <HI>Adam</HI> had ta&s;ted the forbidden Fruit, which was the only Re&s;traint laid upon him, he forfeited this Priviledge, and had no Right, &s;ince he had di&s;obeyed his Creator, to the U&s;e of any one of the Creatures.</P>
<P>But, ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, this Charter, as well as all other Privileges, is re&s;tored to us by the Death of the &s;econd <HI>Adam,</HI> our LORD and Ma&s;ter JESUS CHRIST. Of every Bea&s;t of the Field, every Fi&s;h of the Sea, and what&s;oever f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">eth in the Air, or moveth on the Face of the Earth, that is fit for Food, we may freely eat, <HI>i. e.</HI> without Scruple take, and eat; but then, with this Limitation, that we u&s;e them mode|rately. For GOD, by the Death of JESUS, has given no Man Licen&s;e to be intemperate; but, on the contrary, has laid us under the &s;tronge&s;t Obligations to live &s;oberly, as well as godly in this pre&s;ent World.</P>
<P>But the Drunkard, de&s;pi&s;ing the Goodne&s;s and Bounty of GOD, in re&s;toring to us what we had &s;o ju&s;tly forfeited, turns his Grace into Wantonne&s;s; and as though the Creature was not of it&s;elf enough &s;ubject to Vanity, by being

Cur&s;ed for our Sake, he abu&s;es it &s;till more, by making it admini&s;ter to his Lu&s;ts; and turns that Wine which was intended to make glad his Heart, into a deadly Poi&s;on.</P>
<P>But thinke&s;t thou, O Drunkard, who&s;oever thou art, thou &s;halt e&s;cape the righteous Judgment of GOD? No, the Time will &s;hortly come that thou mu&s;t be no longer Steward, aud then the Sovereign Lord of all the Earth will reckon with thee for thus wa&s;ting his Goods. Alas! wilt thou then wre&s;t Scripture any longer to thy own Damnation? And becau&s;e JESUS CHRIST turned Water into Wine at the Mar|riage Fea&s;t, to &s;upply the Wants of his indigent Ho&s;t, &s;ay, that it is therefore meet to make merry, and be drunken. No, thou &s;halt be &s;ilent before him; and know, that tho' thou ha&s;t encouraged thy&s;elf in Drunkenne&s;s by &s;uch like Arguments, yet for all the&s;e Things GOD will bring thee into Judgment.</P>
<P>But, <HI>Secondly,</HI> What makes Drunkenne&s;s more exceeding &s;inful, is, that a Man, by falling into it, &s;inneth again&s;t his own Body.</P>
<P>When the Apo&s;tle would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ade the <HI>Corinthians</HI> from Fornication, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> this as an Argument, <HI>Flee Fornication,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>Brethren; for he that committeth Fornication, &s;inneth again&s;t his own Body.</HI> And may not I as ju&s;tly cry out, Flee Drunkenne&s;s, my Brethren, &s;ince he that committeth that Crime, &s;inneth again&s;t his own Body?

<P>We might perhaps, think our&s;elves hardly dealt with by GOD, was he to &s;end to us, as he did to the Royal P&s;almi&s;t, to choo&s;e one Plague out of three, whereby we &s;hould be de&s;troyed.

And if the Sword has &s;lain its Thou&s;ands, Drunkenne&s;s has &s;lain its ten Thou&s;ands.</P>

<P>But, <HI>Thirdly,</HI> What renders Drunkenne&s;s more inexcu&s;eable, is, that it robs a Man of his Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Rea&s;on is the Glory of a Man; the chief Thing whereby GOD has made us to differ from the Brute Creation. And our modern Unbelievers have exalted it to &s;uch a high Degree, as even to &s;et it in Oppo&s;ition to Revelation, and deny the LORD that bought them. But though in doing this, they greatly err, and whil&s;t they profe&s;s them&s;elves wi&s;e, become real Fools; yet we mu&s;t acknowledge, that Rea&s;on is the Candle of the LORD, and who&s;oever puts it out, &s;hall bear his Puni&s;hment, who&s;oever he be.</P>
<P>But yet, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the Drunkard does. <HI>Nebuchad|nezzar'</HI>s Cur&s;e he makes his Choice, his Rea&s;on departeth from him, and then what is he better than a Brute?</P>
<P>The very Heathen Kings were &s;o &s;en&s;ible of this, that, in order to deter their young Princes from drinking, they u&s;ed to make their Slaves get drunk, and be expo&s;ed before them. And did&s;t thou but &s;ee thine own Picture, O Drunkard, when, after having drowned thy

<P>But what if GOD, in the Mid&s;t of one of the&s;e drunken Fits, &s;hould arre&s;t thee by Death, and &s;ay unto thee, <HI>Thou Fool, this Moment &s;hall thy Soul be required of thee.</HI> Oh!

that he will come at an Hour thou looke&s;t not for him; and &s;ince his Goodne&s;s and Long-Suffering has not led thee to Repentance, he will cut thee down, and not permit thee to cumber the Ground any longer. Con&s;ider this then, all ye that count it a Plea&s;ure to turn your&s;elves into Brutes, le&s;t GOD pluck you away by a &s;udden Death, and there be none to deliver you.</P>
<P>But, <HI>Fourthly,</HI> There is a farther Aggravation of this Crime, that it is an Inlet to, and Fore|runner of many other Sins; for it &s;eldom comes alone.</P>
<P>We may &s;ay of Drunkenne&s;s, as <HI>Solomon</HI> does of Strife, that it is like the letting out of Water; for we know not what will be the End thereof. Its Name is <HI>Legion:</HI> For behold a Troop of Sins cometh after it. And for my own Part, when I &s;ee a Drunkard, I can &s;carce, with the holy Prophet, when he looked in <HI>Hazael'</HI>s Face, forbear weeping, to con&s;ider how many Vices he may fall into, e'er he comes to him&s;elf again.</P>
<P>What ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">d Ince&s;t did righteous <HI>Lot</HI> com|mit with his own Daughters when they had made him drunk? And, I doubt not, but there are many among&s;t you, who have committed &s;uch Crimes when you have deprived your&s;elves of your Rea&s;on by drink|ing, that were you to hear of them, your Heart, like <HI>Nabal</HI>'s, after he was told how he had abu&s;ed <HI>David</HI> when he was drunk, would die within you. And had any one told you,
<PB N="111" REF="004650_0341_100DDDCDD7676CB0">
when you were &s;ober, that you would have been guilty of &s;uch Crimes, you would have cried out, with <HI>Hazael</HI> before mentioned, <HI>Are thy Servants &s;o many Dogs, that they &s;hould do thus?</HI></P>
<P>But no marvel that Drunkards commit &s;uch Crimes: For Drunkenne&s;s drives the Holy Spirit from them: they become mere Ma|chines for the Devil to work up to what he plea&s;es; he enters into them, as he entred into the Herd of Swine; and no Wonder if they then commit all Uncleanne&s;s, and any other Crime, with Greedine&s;s. But this leads me to a</P>
<P><HI>Fifth</HI> Con&s;ideration, which highly aggravates the Sin of Drunkenne&s;s, <HI>viz.</HI> That it &s;eparates the holy Spirit from us.</P>
<P>It is to be hoped, that no one here pre&s;ent need be informed, that before we can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Chri&s;tians indeed, we mu&s;t receive the Holy Gho&s;t, mu&s;t be born again from above, and have the Spirit of GOD witne&s;&s;ing with our Spirits, that we are the Sons of GOD.

<P>But now Drunkards, do, in Effect, bid this Ble&s;&s;ed Spirit depart from them: For what has he to do with &s;uch filthy Swine? No, they have no Lot or Share in the Spirit
<PB N="112" REF="004650_0342_100DDDCF6128EC10">
of the Son of <HI>David.</HI> They have cha&s;ed him out of their Hearts, by defiling his Temple; I mean their Bodies. And he can no more hold Communion with them, than Light can have Communion with Darkne&s;s, or CHRIST have Concord with <HI>Belial.</HI></P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle therefore, in the Words of the Text, exhorts the <HI>Ephe&s;ians, not to be drunk with Wine, wherein is Exce&s;s, but to be filled with the Spirit;</HI> thereby implying, that Drunkenne&s;s and the Spirit of GOD could never dwell in the &s;ame Heart. And in another Epi&s;tle, he bids them <HI>avoid unpro|fitable Conver&s;ation, as a Thing which grieved the Holy Spirit; whereby alone they could be &s;ealed to the Day of Redemption.</HI> And if unprofitable Conver&s;ation grieves the Holy Spirit, at what an infinite Di&s;tance mu&s;t Drunkenne&s;s drive him from the Hearts of Men?</P>
<P>But oh that you were wi&s;e! That you would con&s;ider what a dreadful Thing it is to have the Spirit of the Living GOD depart from you: For, a&s;&s;ure your&s;elves, if you live without him, you live without GOD in the World. You are in the &s;ame mi&s;erable forlorn Condition as <HI>Saul</HI> was, when an evil Spirit of the LORD came upon him; and you are only &s;o many Ve&s;&s;els of Wrath fitted for De&s;truction. But this brings me to the</P>
<P><HI>Sixth</HI> and la&s;t Rea&s;on I &s;hall urge again&s;t the Sin of Drunkenne&s;s, that it ab&s;olutely unfits a

JESUS CHRIST, in the &s;ame Manner as learned Men read <HI>Cae&s;ar's Commentaries,</HI> or <HI>the Conque&s;ts of Alexander;</HI> as Things rather intended to afford Matter for Speculation, than to be acted over again in and by us.</P>
<P>As this is true of the Doctrines of the Go&s;pel in general, &s;o it is in particular of the Operations of GOD's Spirit upon the Hearts of Believers for we no &s;ooner mention the Nece&s;&s;ity of our receiving the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> in the&s;e la&s;t Days, as well as formerly; but we are look'd upon by &s;ome, as Enthu&s;ia&s;ts and Madmen; and, by others, repre&s;ented as wilfully deceiving the People, and undermining the e&s;tabli&s;hed Con|&s;titution of the Church.</P>
<P>Judge ye then, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> whether it is not high Time for the true Mini&s;ters of JESUS CHRIST, who have been them&s;elves made Partakers of this heavenly Gift, to lift up their Voices like a Trumpet; and if they would not have tho&s;e Souls peri&s;h for which the LORD JESUS has &s;hed his precious Blood, to declare with all Boldne&s;s, that the Holy Spirit is the common Privilege and Portion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> in all Ages; and that we al&s;o, as well as the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians, mu&s;t receive the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> e'er we can be truly called the Children of GOD.</P>

Tabernacles.

<ITEM>And, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I am briefly to &s;hew what is meant by the Spirit.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>By the <HI>Spirit,</HI> or the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> is to be under&s;tood the third Per&s;on in the ever ble&s;&s;ed Trinity, con&s;ub&s;tantial and co-eternal with the Father and the Son, proceeding from, yet equal to them both&mdash;For to u&s;e the Words of our Church in this Day's Office, that which we believe of the Glory of the <HI>Father,</HI> the &s;ame we believe of the <HI>Son,</HI> and of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> without any Difference or Inequality.</P>
<P>Thus &s;ays St.<HI>John,</HI> in his fir&s;t Epi&s;tle, Chap. v. Ver. 7. <HI>There are Three that bear Record in Heaven, the</HI> Father, <HI>the</HI> Word, <HI>and the</HI> Holy Gho&s;t, <HI>and the&s;e Three are one.</HI> And our LORD when he gave his Apo&s;tles Commi&s;&s;ion to go and teach all Nations, commands them to baptize in the Name of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> as well as of the <HI>Father</HI> and the <HI>Son.</HI>&mdash;And St. <HI>Peter, Acts</HI> v. Ver.3. &s;aid to <HI>Ananias, Why hath Satan filled thine Heart to lie to the Holy Gho&s;t?</HI> And, Ver.4. he &s;ays, <HI>Thou ha&s;t not lied unto Men, but unto GOD.</HI>&mdash;From all which Pa&s;&s;ages, it is plain&punc; that the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> is truly and properly GOD, as well as the <HI>Father</HI> and the <HI>Son.</HI> This is an un&s;peakable My&s;tery, but a My&s;tery of GOD's revealing, and therefore to be a&s;&s;ented to
<PB N="124" REF="004650_0354_100DDDEFB8B760F0">
with our whole Hearts.&mdash;Seeing GOD is not a Man that he &s;hould lie, nor the Son of Man that he &s;hould deceive.</P>
<P>I proceed, <HI>Secondly,</HI> to prove that the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> is the common Privilege of all Believers.</P>
<P>But, here I would not be under&s;tood of &s;o receiving the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> as to enable us to work Miracles, or &s;hew outward Signs and Wonders. For I allow our Adver&s;aries, that to pretend to be in&s;pired, in this Sen&s;e, is being wi&s;e above what is written. Perhaps it cannot be proved, that GOD ever interpo&s;ed in this extraordinary Manner, but when &s;ome new Revelation was to be e&s;tabli&s;hed, as at the fir&s;t &s;ettling of the Mo&s;aick and Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation.&mdash;And as for my own Part, I cannot but &s;u&s;pect the Spirit of tho&s;e who in&s;i&s;t upon a Repetition of &s;uch Miracles at this Time.&mdash;For the World being now become nominally Chri&s;tian, at lea&s;t, (though GOD knows, little of the Power is left among us) there need not outward Miracles, but only an inward Co-operation of the Holy <HI>Spirit</HI> with the <HI>Word,</HI> to prove that JESUS is that <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> which was to come into the World.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, it is po&s;&s;ible for thee, O Man, to have Faith, &s;o as to be able to remove Moun|tains, or ca&s;t out Devils; nay, thou mighte&s;t &s;peak with the Tongue of Men and Angels, yea, and bid the Sun &s;tand &s;till in the mid&s;t of Heaven; yet, what would all the&s;e Gifts of the Spirit avail thee, without being made Par|taker of his &s;anctifying Graces? <HI>Saul</HI> had the
<PB N="125" REF="004650_0355_100DDDF241338A78">
Spirit of Government for a while, &s;o as to become another Man, and yet was a Ca&s;taway.&mdash;And many, who ca&s;t out Devils in CHRIST's Name, at the la&s;t will be di&s;owned by him. If therefore thou had&s;t only the Gifts, but was de&s;titute of the Graces of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> they would only &s;erve to lead thee with &s;o much the more Solemnity to Hell.</P>
<P>Here then, I &s;ay, we join i&s;&s;ue with our Adver&s;aries, and will readily grant, that we are not in this Sen&s;e to be in&s;pired, as were our LORD's fir&s;t Apo&s;tles. But unle&s;s Men have Eyes which &s;ee not, and Ears which hear not, how can they read the latter Part of the Text, and not confe&s;s that the Holy Spirit, in another Sen&s;e, is the common Privilege of all Believers, even to the End of the World?&mdash;<HI>This &s;pake be of the Spirit, which they that believe on him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> receive.</HI>&mdash;Ob&s;erve, he does not &s;ay, they that believe on him for one or two Ages, but they that believe on him in general, <HI>i. e.</HI> at all Times, and in all Places.&mdash;So that unle&s;s we can prove that St. <HI>John</HI> was under a Delu&s;ion when he wrote the&s;e Words, we mu&s;t believe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> we even we al&s;o, &s;hall receive the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> we believe on the Lord JESUS with our whole Hearts.</P>

<P>There's a great Noi&s;e made of late, about the Word <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;t,</HI> and it has been ca&s;t upon the Preachers of the Go&s;pel, as a Term of Reproach.&mdash;But every Chri&s;tian, in the proper Sen&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the Word, mu&s;t be an Enthu&s;ia&s;t.&mdash;That is, mu&s;t be in&s;pired of GOD, or have GOD in him. For who dares &s;ay, he is a Chri&s;tian, till he can &s;ay, <HI>GOD is in me?</HI> St. <HI>Peter</HI> tells us, we have many great and precious Promi&s;es, that we may be made Partakers of the Divine Nature.&mdash;Our LORD prays, <HI>that we may be one, as the Father and He are One;</HI> and our own Church, in Conformity to the&s;e Texts of Scripture, in her excellent Communion-Office,
<PB N="127" REF="004650_0357_100DDDF67A66ED80">
tells us, that tho&s;e who receive the Sacrament worthily, <Q>dwell in CHRIST, and CHRIST in them; that they are one with CHRIST, and CHRIST with them.</Q>&mdash;And yet Chri&s;tians in general, mu&s;t have their Names ca&s;t out as Evil, and Mini&s;ters in particular mu&s;t be looked upon as Deceivers of the People, for affirming, that we mu&s;t be really united to GOD, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> receiving the Holy Gho&s;t. Be a&s;toni&s;hed, O Heavens, at this!</P>
<P>Indeed, I will not &s;ay, our Letter-learned Preachers deny this Doctrine in expre&s;s Words.&mdash;But however, they do it in Effect.&mdash;For they talk profe&s;&s;edly again&s;t inward Feelings, and &s;ay, we may have GOD's Spirit without feeling it, which is in Reality to deny the Thing it|&s;elf&mdash;And had I a Mind to hinder the Progre&s;s of the Go&s;pel, and to e&s;tabli&s;h the Kingdom of Darkne&s;s, I would go about, telling People, they might have the Spirit of GOD, and yet not feel it.</P>
<P>But to return,&mdash;When our LORD was about to a&s;cend to his Father, and our Father; to his GOD, and our GOD; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> Apo&s;tles this Commi&s;&s;ion, <HI>Go and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI>&mdash;By the Term, <HI>All Nations,</HI> 'tis allowed, are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> that &s;hould profe&s;s to believe on JESUS <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> even to the End of the World.

be proved will be undeniable. For though we tran&s;late the&s;e Words, <HI>baptizing them in the Name;</HI> yet as the Name of GOD, in the LORD's Prayer, and &s;everal other Places, &s;ig|nifies his Nature, they might as well be tran|&s;lated thus, <HI>baptizing them into the Nature of the Father, into the Nature of the Son, and into the Nature of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> And con&s;equently, if we are all to be baptized into the Nature of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> e'er our Bapti&s;m be effectual to Salvation, it is evident, that we all mu&s;t actually receive the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> e'er we can &s;ay, we truly believe in JESUS CHRIST.

<P>Numbers of other Texts might be quoted, to make this Doctrine, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till more plain.&mdash;But I am a&s;toni&s;hed, that any, who call them&s;elves Members; much more, that many, who are Preachers of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> &s;hould dare &s;o much as open their Lips again&s;t it.

<P>I know indeed 'tis now no uncommon thing among&s;t us, to deny the Doctrine of original Sin, as well as the Divinity of JESUS CHRIST, who is GOD over all, ble&s;&s;ed forever&mdash;But it is incumbent on tho&s;e who deny it, fir&s;t to di&s;prove the Authority of the Holy Scrip|tures&mdash;If thou can&s;t prove, thou Unbeliever, that the Book, which we call <HI>The Bible,</HI> does not contain the lively Oracles of GOD; if thou can&s;t &s;hew, that holy Men of Old, did not write this Book, as they were in|wardly moved by the Holy Gho&s;t, then will we give up the Doctrine of original Sin&mdash;But unle&s;s thou can&s;t do this, we mu&s;t in|&s;i&s;t upon it, that we are all conceived and born in Sin; if for no other, yet for this one Rea&s;on, becau&s;e that GOD, who cannot lye, has told us &s;o.</P>

For if they will grant that the Devil worketh, and that &s;o as to be felt in the Hearts of the Children of Di&s;obedience (which they mu&s;t grant, unle&s;s they will give an Apo&s;tle the Lie) where is the Wonder that the good Spirit &s;hould have the &s;ame Power over tho&s;e that are truly obedient to the Faith of JESUS CHRIST?</P>
<P>But to return. If it be true then, that we are all by Nature a Motly Mixture of Brute and Devil, it is evident, that we all mu&s;t receive the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> e'er we can dwell with and enjoy GOD.</P>
<P>When you read how the Prodigal in the Go&s;pel was reduced to &s;o low a Condition, as to eat Husks with Swine, and how <HI>Nebuchad|nezzar</HI> was turned out, to graze with Oxen, I am confident, you pity their unhappy State. And when you hear, how JESUS CHRIST will &s;ay, at the la&s;t Day, to all that are not born again of GOD, <HI>Depart from me ye Cur&s;ed, into everla&s;ting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels,</HI> do not your Hearts &s;hrink within you, with a &s;ecret Horror? And if Creatures with only our Degree of Goodne&s;s cannot bear, even the Thoughts of dwelling with Bea&s;ts or Devils, to who&s;e Nature we are &s;o nearly allied, how do we imagine, GOD, who is infinite Goodne&s;s and Purity it&s;elf, can dwell with us, while we are Partakers of both their
<PB N="135" REF="004650_0365_100DDE0CADFDF8B8">
Natures? We might as well think to reconcile Heaven and Hell.</P>
<P>When <HI>Adam</HI> had eaten the forbidden Fruit, he fled and hid him&s;elf from GOD. Why? becau&s;e he was naked; that is, he was alienated from the Life of GOD, the due Puni&s;hment of his Di&s;obedience. Now we are all by Nature naked and void of GOD, as he was at that Time, and con&s;equently, till we are changed, and cloathed upon by a Divine Nature again, we mu&s;t fly from GOD al&s;o.</P>
<P>Hence then appears the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of our being obliged to receive the Spirit of GOD. It is founded on the Doctrine of Original Sin. And therefore you will always find that tho&s;e who talk again&s;t feeling the Operations of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> very rarely, or very &s;lightly at lea&s;t, mention our Fall in <HI>Adam.</HI> No, they refer St. <HI>Paul'</HI>s Account of the Depravity of Unbelievers, only to tho&s;e of old Time. Whereas 'tis obvious, on the contrary, that we are all equally included under the Guilt and Con&s;equences of our fir&s;t Parent's Sin, even as others; and to u&s;e the Language of our own Church-Article, bring into the World with us a Corruption, which renders us liable to GOD's Wrath, and Eternal Damnation.</P>
<P>Should I preach to you any other Doctrine, I &s;hould wrong my own Soul; I &s;hould be found a fal&s;e Witne&s;s towards GOD <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> And he that preaches any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Doctrine, how&s;oever dignified and di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;hall bear his Puni&s;hment who&s;oever he be.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="004650_0366_100DDE0FED2167E0">
From this plain Rea&s;on then appears the Nece&s;&s;ity why we, as well as the fir&s;t Apo&s;tle, in this Sen&s;e, mu&s;t receive the Spirit of GOD.</P>
<P>For the great Work of Sanctification, or making us holy, is particularly referred to the Holy Gho&s;t. And therefore our LORD &s;ays, <HI>Unle&s;s a Man be born of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>For JESUS CHRIST came down to &s;ave us not only from the Guilt, but al&s;o from the Power of Sin. And however often we have repeated our Creed, and told GOD we believe in the Holy Cho&s;t, yet if we have not believed in him, &s;o as to be really united to JESUS CHRIST by him, we have no more Concord with JESUS CHRIST than <HI>Belial</HI> him&s;elf.</P>
<P>And now, my Brethren, what &s;hall I &s;ay more? Tell me, are not many of you offended at what has been &s;aid already? Do not &s;ome of you think, though I mean well, yet I have carried the Point a little too far? Are not others ready to cry out, If this be true, who then can be &s;aved? Is not this driving People into De&s;pair?</P>
<P>Yes, I ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;s it is. But into what De&s;pair? A De&s;pair of Mercy through CHRIST? No, GOD forbid; but a De&s;pair of living with GOD without receiving the Holy Gho&s;t.

And &s;hall not the Phy&s;ician of your Souls be allowed the &s;ame Freedom? And what have I been doing but &s;earching your natural Wounds, that I might convince you of your Danger, and put you upon applying to JESUS CHRIST for a Remedy?

<P>WHEN it plea&s;ed the eternal Son of GOD to tabernacle among us, and come preaching the glad Tidings of Salvation to a fallen World, different Opinions were entertained by different Parties concerning him.&mdash;As to his Per&s;on, &s;ome &s;aid he was <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> others that he was <HI>Elias, Jeremias,</HI> or one of the ancient Prophets; few acknowledged him to be what he really was, GOD Ble&s;&s;ed for evermore.&mdash;And as to his Doctrine, tho' the common People, being free from Prejudice, were per&s;uaded of the heavenly Tendency of his going about to do Good, for the Generality, heard him gladly, and &s;aid he was a good Man; yet the envious, worldly-minded, &s;elf-righteous Governors and Teachers of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Church, being grieved at his Succe&s;s, on the one Hand, and unable (having never been taught of GOD) to under&s;tand the Purity of his Doctrine, on the other; notwith|&s;tanding our LORD &s;pake as never Man &s;pake, and did &s;uch Miracles which no Man could

<P>Thus was the King and Lord of Glory judged by Man's Judgment, when made manife&s;t in the Fle&s;h: Far be it from any of his Mini&s;ters to expect any better Treatment.&mdash;No, if we come in the Spirit and Power of our Ma&s;ter, in this, as in every other Part of his Sufferings, we mu&s;t follow his Steps.&mdash;The like Reproaches which were ca&s;t on him, will be thrown on us al&s;o.&mdash;Tho&s;e that received our Lord and his Doctrine, will receive and hear us for his Name-&s;ake.&mdash;The Poor, ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, as our pre&s;ent Meeting abundantly te&s;tifies, receive the Go&s;pel, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> common People hear us gladly; whil&s;t tho&s;e th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> are &s;itting in <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> his Chair, and love to wear long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">es, being ignorant of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of GOD by Faith in CHRIST JESUS, and having never felt the Power of GOD upon their Hearts, will be continually crying out again&s;t us, as Mad-men, Deceivers of the People, and as acting under the Influences of evil Spirits.</P>

But he is unworthy the Name of a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel of Peace, who is unwilling, not only to have his Name ca&s;t out as evil, but al&s;o to die for the Truths of the Lord JESUS.&mdash;It is the Character of <HI>Hirelings</HI> and <HI>Fal&s;e Prophets,</HI> who care not for the Sheep, to have all Men &s;peak well of them.&mdash;<HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are you,</HI> &s;ays our LORD to his fir&s;t Apo&s;tles, and in them to all &s;ucceeding Mini&s;ters, <HI>when Men &s;peak all Manner of Evil again&s;t you fal&s;ely for my Name &s;ake.</HI>&mdash;And indeed it is impo&s;&s;ible but &s;uch Offences mu&s;t come: For Men will always judge of others according to the Principles from which they act them&s;elves.&mdash;And if they care not to yield Obe|dience to the Doctrines which we deliver, they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, in Self-defence, &s;peak again&s;t the Preachers, le&s;t they &s;hould be ask<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d that Que&s;tion, which the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> of old feared to have retorted on them, if they confe&s;&s;ed that <HI>John</HI> was a Prophet, viz. <HI>Why then did you not believe on him?</HI> In all &s;uch Ca&s;es, we have nothing to do but to &s;earch our own Hearts, and if we can a&s;&s;ure our Con&s;ciences, before GOD, that we act with a &s;ingle Eye to his Glory, we are chearfully to go on in our Work, and not in the lea&s;t to regard what Men or Devils can &s;ay again&s;t, or do unto us.</P>
<P>But to return. You have heard what various Thoughts were handed about concerning <HI>JESUS CHRIST</HI> whil&s;t here on Earth: Nor is he other|wi&s;e treated, even now he is exalted to &s;it down at the Right Hand of his Father in Heaven.&mdash;A Stranger to Chri&s;tianity, was he to hear we all

profe&s;s to hold one LORD, would naturally infer, that we all thought and &s;poke one and the &s;ame Thing about him. But alas! to out Shame be it mentioned, tho' CHRIST be not divided in him|&s;elf, yet Profe&s;&s;ors are &s;adly divided in their Thoughts about him; and that not only as to the Circum&s;tances of his Religion, but al&s;o of tho&s;e e&s;&s;ential Truths which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be believed and received by us, if ever we hope to be Heirs of eternal Salvation.</P>
<P>Some, and that I fear a Multitude which no Man can ea&s;ily number, there are among&s;t us, who call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, and yet &s;eldom or never &s;eriou&s;ly think of JESUS CHRIST at all. They can think of their Shops, and their Farms, their Plays, their Balls, their A&s;&s;emblies, and Hor&s;e-races (Entertainments which directly tend to exclude Religion out of the World) but as for CHRIST, the Author and Fini&s;her of their Faith, the LORD who has bought them with his pre|cious Blood, and who is the only Thing worth their thinking of, alas! he is not in all, at mo&s;t in very few, of their Thoughts. But believe me, O ye earthly, &s;en&s;ual, carnally minded Profe&s;&s;ors, however little you may think of CHRIST now, or however indu&s;triou&s;ly you may &s;trive to keep him out of your Thoughts, by pur&s;uing the Lu&s;t of the Eye, the Lu&s;t of the Fle&s;h, and the Pride of Life, yet there is a Time coming, when you will wi&s;h you had thought of CHRIST more, and of your Profits and Plea&s;ures le&s;s.&mdash;For the Gay; the Polite, the Rich al&s;o mu&s;t die as well as others, and leave their Pomps, their

Vanities, and all their Wealth behind them.&mdash;And oh! what Thoughts will you entertain concerning JESUS CHRIST, in that Hour.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not pur&s;ue the&s;e Reflections: They would carry me too far from the main De&s;ign of this Di&s;cour&s;e, which is to &s;hew what tho&s;e that are truly de&s;irous to know how to wor&s;hip GOD in Spirit and in Truth, ought to think concern|ing JESUS CHRIST, whom GOD hath &s;ent to be the End of the Law for Righteou&s;ne&s;s to all them that &s;hall believe.</P>
<P>I tru&s;t, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> you are more noble than to think me too &s;trict or &s;crupulous, in thus at|tempting to regulate even your Thoughts about JESUS CHRIST: For by our Thoughts as well as our Words and Actions, are we to be judged at the Great Day. And in vain do we hope to believe in, or wor&s;hip CHRIST aright, unle&s;s our Principles, on which our Faith and Practice is founded, are agreeable to the Form of &s;ound Words deliver'd to us in the Scriptures of Truth.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, many Deceivers are gone abroad into the World. Mere <HI>Heathen Morality,</HI> and not JESUS CHRIST, is preached in mo&s;t of our Churches. And how &s;hould People think rightly of CHRIST, of whom they have &s;carcely heard? Do bear with me a little then, whil&s;t, to inform your Con&s;ciences, I ask you a few Que&s;tions concerning JESUS CHRIST: For there is no other Name given under Heaven, whereby we can be &s;aved, but his.</P>
<P>And <HI>Fir&s;t, What think you about the Per&s;on of</HI> CHRIST? <HI>Who&s;e Son is he?</HI> This is the Qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">
<PB N="177" REF="004650_0407_100DDE788BC38538">
our LORD puts to the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> in the Words following the Text; and never was it more nece&s;&s;ary to repeat this Que&s;tion than in the&s;e la&s;t Days. For Numbers that are called after the Name of CHRIST, and I fear, many that pretend to preach him, are &s;o far advanced in the bla&s;phemous Chair, as openly to deny his being really, truly and properly GOD. But no one that ever was Partaker of his Spirit, will &s;peak thus lightly of him. No; if they are asked, as <HI>Peter</HI> and his Brethren were, <HI>but whom &s;ay ye that I am?</HI> they will reply without He&s;itation. <HI>Thou art</HI> CHRIST <HI>the Son of the ever-living GOD.</HI> For the Confe&s;&s;ion of our Lord's Divinity, is the Rock upon which be builds his Church. Was it po&s;&s;ible to take this away, the Gates of Hell would quickly prevail again&s;t it.&mdash;<HI>My Brethren,</HI> if JESUS CHRIST be not very GOD of very GOD, I would never preach the Go&s;pel of CHRIST again. For it would not be Go&s;pel; it would be only a Sy&s;tem of moral Ethicks: <HI>Seneca, Cicero,</HI> or any of the Gentile Philo&s;ophers would be as good a Saviour as JESUS of <HI>Nazareth.</HI> It is the Divinity of our LORD that gives a Sanction to his Death, and makes him &s;uch a High-Prie&s;t as became us, <HI>viz.</HI> One who by the infinite Merits of his Suffering could make a full, perfect, &s;ufficient Sacrifice, Satis|faction and Oblation to an infinitely offended Ju&s;tice.

<P>Many will think the&s;e hard Sayings: But I think it no Breach of Charity to affirm, that an <HI>Arian</HI> or <HI>Socinian</HI> cannot be a Chri&s;tian.&mdash;The one would make us believe JESUS CHRIST <HI>is only a Created God,</HI> which is a Self-Contradiction. And the other would have us look on him only as <HI>a Good Man,</HI> and in&s;tead of owning his Death to be an Attonement for the Sins of the World, would per&s;uade us, <HI>that</HI> CHRIST <HI>died only to &s;eal the Truth of his Doctrine with his Blood.</HI> But if JESUS CHRIST be no more than a mere Man, if he be not truly GOD, he was the vile&s;t Sinner that ever appeared in the World.&mdash;For he accep|ted of Divine Adoration from the Man who had been born blind, as we read <HI>John</HI> ix. 38. <HI>And he &s;aid, LORD I believe, and wor&s;hipped him.</HI> Be&s;ides, if CHRIST be not properly GOD, our Faith is vain, we are yet in our Sins:&mdash;For no created Being, tho' of the highe&s;t Order, could po&s;&s;ibly merit any thing at GOD's Hands.: No, it was our LORD's Divinity, that alone qualified him to take away the Sins of the World; and and therefore we hear St. <HI>John</HI> pronouncing &s;o po&s;itively, that <HI>the Word,</HI> i. e. JESUS CHRIST, <HI>was not only with GOD, but was GOD.</HI>&mdash;For the like Rea&s;on, St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays, that <HI>he was in the Form of GOD.&mdash;That in him dwelt all the Ful|ne&s;s of the Godhead bodily.</HI>&mdash;Nay, JESUS CHRIST him&s;elf a&s;&s;umes the Title which GOD gave to

<P>But, <HI>Secondly, What think you of the Manhood or Incarnation of</HI> JESUS CHRIST? For CHRIST was not only GOD, but he was GOD and Man in one Per&s;on.&mdash;Thus runs the Text and Context.&mdash;<HI>When the Phari&s;ees were gathered together.</HI>

JESUS <HI>asked them, &s;aying, What think ye of</HI> CHRIST? <HI>Who&s;e Son is he?</HI> They &s;ay unto him, <HI>the Son of</HI> David.&mdash;<HI>How then,</HI> &s;ays our Divine Ma&s;ter, <HI>does</HI> David <HI>in Spirit call him LORD?</HI> From which Pa&s;&s;age it is evident, that we do not think rightly of the Per&s;on of JESUS CHRIST, unle&s;s we believe him to be perfect GOD and perfect Man, of a rea&s;onable Soul and human Fle&s;h &s;ub&s;i&s;ting.</P>
<P>For it is on this Account that he is called CHRIST, or the <HI>anointed, i. e.</HI> one who thro' his own voluntary Offer was &s;et apart by the Father, and &s;trengthened and qualified by the Anointing or Communication of the Holy Gho&s;t, to be a Mediator between Him and offending Man.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on or fir&s;t Cau&s;e why the Son of GOD took upon him our Nature, was, the Fall of our fir&s;t Parents.&mdash;I hope there is no one pre&s;ent &s;o athei&s;tical, as to think that Man made him&s;elf: No, it was GOD that made us, and not we our&s;elves.&mdash;And I would willingly think, that no one would be &s;o bla&s;phemous as to &s;up|po&s;e, that if GOD did make us, he made us &s;uch Creatures as we now find our&s;elves to be. For this would be giving GOD's Word the lie, which tells us, that <HI>in the Image of GOD,</HI> not in the Image which we now bear on our Souls, <HI>made be Man.</HI>&mdash;Far be it from us to think thus: For as GOD made Man, &s;o GOD made him perfect.

eternal Death, if he broke his Law, and eat the forbidden Fruit.</P>
<P>Man did eat; and herein acting as our Re|pre&s;entative, thereby involved both him&s;elf and us in that Cur&s;e, which GOD, the righteous Judge, had &s;aid &s;hould be the Con&s;equence of his Di&s;obedience.&mdash;But here begins that My&s;tery of Godline&s;s, GOD manife&s;ted in the Fle&s;h.

Man is permitted to fall, and become &s;ubject to Death; but JESUS the only begotten Son of GOD, be|gotten of the Father before all Worlds, God of God, Light of Light, very God, of very God, offers to die to make an Attonement for his Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and to fulfil all Righteou&s;ne&s;s in his &s;tead. And becau&s;e it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to do this as he was GOD, and yet &s;ince Man had offended, it was nece&s;&s;ary it &s;hould be done in the Per&s;on of Man, rather than we &s;hould peri&s;h; this <HI>Everla&s;ting GOD,</HI> this <HI>Prince of Peace,</HI> this <HI>Antient of Days,</HI> in the Fulne&s;s of Time, had a Body prepared for him by the Holy Gho&s;t, and became an Infant of a Span long.&mdash;In this Body he performed a compleat Obedience to the Law of GOD, whereby he, in our &s;tead, fulfilled the Covenant of Works, and at la&s;t became &s;ubject to Death, even the Death upon the Cro&s;s; that as GOD he might &s;atisfy, as Man he might obey and &s;uffer; and being GOD and Man in

<P>And now, What think you of this Love of CHRIST? Do not you think it was wondrous great? E&s;pecially when you con&s;ider that we were CHRIST'S bitter Enemies, and that he would have been infinitely happy in him&s;elf, notwith|&s;tanding we had peri&s;hed for ever.&mdash;Whatever you may think of it, I know the ble&s;&s;ed Angels, who are not &s;o much concerned in this My&s;tery of Godline&s;s as we, think mo&s;t highly of it.&mdash;They do, they will de&s;ire to look into and admire it, thro' all Eternity.&mdash;Why, Oh why, ye Sinners, will you not think of this Love of CHRIST!&mdash;Surely it mu&s;t melt down the mo&s;t harden'd Heart.&mdash;Whil&s;t I am &s;peaking, the Thoughts of this infinite and conde&s;cending Love, fires and warms my Soul.&mdash;I could dwell on it forever.&mdash;But it is expedient for you, that I &s;hould ask you another Que&s;tion concerning JESUS CHRIST.</P>

In the great Work of Man's Redemption, Boa&s;ting is intirely excluded; which could not be if only one of our Works was to be joined with the Merits of CHRIST. Our Salvation is all of GOD from the Beginning to the End. It is not of Works, le&s;t any Man &s;hould boa&s;t.

<P>Not that you mu&s;t think GOD will &s;ave you becau&s;e, or on Account of your Faith: For Faith is a Work, and then you would be ju&s;tified for your Works.

St. <HI>Paul</HI> in his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Romans,</HI> after he had in the fir&s;t five Chapters demon&s;trably proved the Doctrine of Ju&s;tification by Faith alone; in the &s;ixth, brings in an Unbeliever &s;aying, <HI>&s;hall we continue in Sin then that Grace may abound?</HI> But as he rejected &s;uch an Inference with a <HI>God forbid,</HI> &s;o do I: For the Faith which we preach is not a dead &s;peculative Faith, <HI>an a&s;&s;enting to Things credible as credible,</HI> as it is commonly defined.

It is a living Principle wrought in the Soul, by the Spirit of the Ever-living GOD, convincing the Sinner of his lo&s;t, undone Condi|tion by Nature, enabling him to apply and lay hold on the perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> freely offered him in the Go&s;pel, and continually exciting him out of a Principle of Love and

<P>It's true, the Doctrine of our free Ju&s;tification by Faith in CHRIST JESUS, like other Go&s;pel Truths, may and will be abu&s;ed by Men of cor|rupt Minds, Reprobates concerning the Faith: But they who receive the Truth of GOD in the Love of it, will always be &s;hewing their Faith by their Works.

<P>People's mi&s;taking the Doctrine of free Ju&s;ti|fication, I believe, is partly owing to their not rightly con&s;idering the different Per&s;ons St. <HI>Paul</HI> and St. <HI>James</HI> wrote to in their Epi&s;tles, as al&s;o the different Kind of Ju&s;tification each of them writes about: The former a&s;&s;erts in Line upon Line, Argument upon Argument, <HI>that we are ju&s;tified by Faith alone.</HI>&mdash;The latter put<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> this Que&s;tion, <HI>Was not</HI> Abraham <HI>ju&s;tified by Works?</HI> From whence many, not con&s;idering the different Views of the&s;e Holy Men, and the different Per|&s;ons they wrote to, have blended and joined Faith and Works in order to ju&s;tifie us in the Sight of God. But this is a Mi&s;take all over: For St. <HI>Paul</HI> was writing to the Jewi&s;h Pro&s;elites, who &s;ought Righteou&s;ne&s;s by the Works, not of the Ceremonial only, but of the Moral Law.&mdash;In Contradi&s;tinction to that, he tells them they were to look for Ju&s;tification in God's Sight, only by the perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> appre|hended by Faith.&mdash;St. <HI>James</HI> had a different-Set of People to deal with, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;uch who abu&s;ed the

<HEAD>A PRAYER for one entru&s;ted with the Education of Children.</HEAD>
<P>O Deare&s;t JESU, who gathere&s;t thy Lambs into thy Bo&s;om, and did&s;t &s;olemnly command thy Servant <HI>Peter,</HI> to feed thy Lambs; grant I may &s;hew that I love thee more than all Things, by doing as thou ha&s;t commanded him.</P>
<P>LORD, who am I, or what is in me, that thou &s;hould thus put Honour upon me, in making me any way in&s;trumental to the preparing Souls for thee? O Saviour, I have &s;inned again&s;t Heaven, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son, much le&s;s to be employed in the Service of thy Children.</P>
<P>But &s;ince thou ha&s;t been plea&s;ed in me to &s;hew forth all thy Mercy, and ha&s;t called me by thy good Providence to this ble&s;&s;ed Work, grant that I may always remember, that the little Flock committed to my Charge, are bought with the Price of thy own mo&s;t precious Blood. And

let it therefore be my Meat and Drink, to feed them with the &s;incere Milk of thy Word, that they may grow thereby.</P>
<P>To this End, I be&s;eech thee of thy free Grace, fir&s;t to convert my own Soul, and cau&s;e me to become like a little Child my|&s;elf, that from an experimental Know|ledge of my own Corruptions, I may have my &s;piritual Sen&s;es exerci&s;ed, to di&s;cern the fir&s;t Emotions of Evil that may at any Time ari&s;e in their Hearts.</P>

<P>Gracious JESU, let puni&s;hing be always my &s;trange Work; and, if it be po&s;&s;ible, grant that they may be all drawn to their Duty, as I would be drawn my&s;elf, by the Cords of Love. And when I am obliged to correct them, grant it may not be to &s;hew my Authority, or gratify a corrupt Pa&s;&s;ion, but purely out of the &s;ame Motive from which thou do&s;t correct us, to make them Partakers of thy Holine&s;s.</P>
<P>Oh! keep me, I be&s;eech thee, from being angry without a Cau&s;e: Permit me not ra&s;hly to be provoked by the
