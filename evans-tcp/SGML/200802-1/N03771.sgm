<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>ALTHO' the following Account of what GOD has done for my Soul, will, un|doubtedly, be differently judged of, by different People; yet, as, I tru&s;t, a &s;ingle Eye to</HI> GOD'S <HI>Glory moved me to write, and as I find my&s;elf much pre&s;&s;ed in Spirit to publi&s;h it, I am not in the lea&s;t &s;olicitous about the Treat|ment it will meet with in the World.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Benefit I have received from Reading the Lives of good Men; the Examples we have in Scripture of the Sacred Authors compo&s;ing their own Hi&s;tories; and, more e&s;pecially the A&s;&s;i&s;tances I have received from the</HI> Holy Spirit, <HI>in bringing many Things to my Remembrance, which otherwi&s;e I &s;hould have forgotten, &s;eemed to me Rea&s;ons &s;uffi|cient to ju&s;tify my Conduct, in the Sight of GOD and all good Men.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Further, As GOD has been plea&s;ed of late to call me to a</HI> Publick Work, <HI>I thought his Children would be glad to know how I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> trained up for it. And, tho' &s;ome may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> this had been as well deferr'd till after

my Death, or wrote by &s;ome other Per&s;on; yet, I thought it would be more beneficial, and be better credited, if wrote with my own Hand, and publi&s;hed whil&s;t I was yet alive.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In the Accounts of good Men, which I have read, I have ob&s;erved, that the Writers of them have been partial: They have given us the</HI> bright, <HI>but not the</HI> black <HI>Side of their Characters. This, I think, proceeds from carnal Rea&s;oning, le&s;t mentioning the Per&s;on's Faults &s;hould encourage others in Sin. It cannot, I am &s;ure, proceed from that Wi&s;dom which cometh from above. The &s;acred Wri|ters give an Account of their Failings, as well as their Virtues:</HI> Peter <HI>is not a&s;hamed to confe&s;s, that with Oaths and Cur&s;es he thrice denied his Ma&s;ter; nor do the Evan|geli&s;ts make any Scruple of telling, that out of</HI> Mary Magdalen JESUS CHRIST <HI>ca&s;t &s;even Devils.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I fearing, therefore, le&s;t my &s;urviving Friends &s;hould not be thus impartial in giving an Account of me, was re&s;olved (among other Rea&s;ons) to give the following Account of my&s;elf, that tho&s;e who now have my Per|&s;on too much in Admiration, &s;eeing what once I was, may learn not to think more highly of me than they ought to think: That th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e who are awaken'd to a Sen&s;e of Sin, may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t de|&s;pair; &s;ince for this Cau&s;e I obtained Mercy that in me</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ort

<P><HI>As I have often wi&s;hed, when in my be&s;t Frame, that the fir&s;t Years of my Life might be put down as a Blank, and had no more in Remembrance; &s;o I could almo&s;t wi&s;h now to pa&s;s them over in Silence.

<HEAD>SECTION I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>From my Infancy, 'till my being for &s;ome Time at the Univer&s;ity.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_I WAS born in <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI> in the Month of <HI>December,</HI> 1714. My Father and Mother kept the <HI>Bell-Inn:</HI> The former died when I was two Years old, the latter is now alive; and has often told me, how &s;he endured fourteen Weeks Sickne&s;s after &s;he brought me into the World; but was u&s;ed to &s;ay, even when I was an Infant, that &s;he expected more Comfort from me than any other of her Children. This, with the Circum&s;tance of my being born in an Inn, has been often of Service to me, in exciting me to make good my Mother's
<PB N="2" REF="004626_0006_100D867D64CE39D8">
Expectations; and to follow the Example of my dear Saviour, who was born in a Stable, and laid in a Manger belonging to an Inn.</P>
<P>My very infant Years mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily not be mentioned: Yet I can remember &s;uch early Stirrings of Corruption in my Heart, as abundantly convince me, that <HI>I was conceived and born in Sin;</HI> that in me dwelleth no good Thing by Nature; and, that if GOD had not freely preven|ted me by his Grace, I mu&s;t have been forever bani&s;hed from his divine Pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>I can truly &s;ay, I was froward from my Mother's Womb: I was &s;o bruti&s;h as to hate In&s;truction, and u&s;ed purpo&s;ely to &s;hun all Opportunities of receiving it. I can date &s;ome very early Acts of Unclean|ne&s;s. I &s;oon gave pregnant Proofs of an impudent Temper. Lying, filthy Talking, and fooli&s;h Je&s;ting, I was much addicted to, even when very young. Sometimes I u&s;ed to Cur&s;e, if not Swear. Stealing from my Mother I thought no Theft at all, and therefore u&s;ed to make no Scruple of Steal|ing Money out of her Pocket before &s;he was up; and have more than once &s;pent Money I took in the Hou&s;e in buying Fruits, Tarts, &amp;c. to &s;atisfy my &s;en&s;ual Appetite. I was never much given to Fighting; but that, I fear, rather proceeded
<PB N="3" REF="004626_0007_100D86822CC79F80">
from Cowardice, than a Principle of Meekne&s;s, or a good Temper. Numbers of <HI>Sabbaths</HI> have I broken; and generally u&s;ed to behave my&s;elf very irreverently in GOD's <HI>Sanctuaries.</HI> Much Money have I &s;pent in Plays, and in the common En|tertainments of the Age. Cards, and Read|ing Romances were my Heart's Delight. Often have I joined with others in Playing rogui&s;h Tricks; but was generally, if not always, happily detected; for which I have often &s;ince, and do now, prai&s;e GOD.</P>
<P>It would be endle&s;s to recount the Sins and Offences of my younger Days; they are more in Number than the Hairs of my Head; my Heart would fail me at the Remembrance of them, was I not a&s;&s;ured that my Redeemer liveth ever to make In|terce&s;&s;ion for me. However the young Man in the Go&s;pel might boa&s;t, that he had <HI>kept,</HI> yet (with Shame and Confu&s;ion of Face) I confe&s;s, that all GOD's Com|mandments I have <HI>broken</HI> from my Youth. Whatever fore&s;een Fitne&s;s others may boa&s;t of for Salvation (if I trace my&s;elf from my Cradle to my Manhood) I can &s;ee nothing in me but a Fitne&s;s to be damned. And, if GOD had not quicken|ed me by his Free Spirit when dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins, and irre&s;i&s;tibly worked upon my Soul, I had now either been &s;it|ting.
<PB N="4" REF="004626_0008_100D8684E082E810">
in Darkne&s;s and in the Shadow of Death, or been condemned, as the due Reward of my Crimes, to be forever lifting up my Eyes i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Torments.</P>
<P>But, &s;uch was the Free Grace of GOD to me, that tho' Corruption worked &s;o &s;trongly in my Soul, and produced &s;uch early and bitter Fruits; yet, I can recol|lect very early Movings of the Ble&s;&s;ed Spirit upon my Heart, &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy me that GOD loved me with an everla&s;ting Love, and &s;eparated me (even from my Mo|ther's Womb) for the Work to which he afterwards was plea&s;ed to call me.</P>
<P>I had early &s;ome Convictions of Sin; and once, I remember, when Per&s;ons (as they frequently did) made it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to tantalize me, I immediately retired to my Room and kneeled down, and with many Tears, prayed over that P&s;alm wherein <HI>David</HI> &s;o often repeats the&s;e Words, <HI>But in the Name of the LORD will I de&s;troy them.</HI> I was always fond of being a Cler|gyman; I u&s;ed frequently to imitate the Mini&s;ter's Reading Prayers, and to make little Sermons in little Books about as long as my Finger. Part of the Money I u&s;ed to &s;teal from my Parents, I gave to the Poor, and &s;ome Books I privately took from others (for which I have &s;ince returned Four-fold) I remember were Books of Devotion.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="004626_0009_100D8688687E7868">
My Mother was very careful of my Education, put me out to two different Schools to board, and always kept me in my tender Years (for which I can never &s;ufficiently thank her) from inter|meddling in the lea&s;t with publick Bu&s;i|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>About the tenth Year of my Age, it plea&s;ed GOD to permit my Mother to marry a &s;econd Time. It proved what the World would call an unhappy Match, as to temporal Things; but GOD over|ruled it for Good. It &s;et many of my Brethren upon thinking more than other|wi&s;e they would have done, and made an uncommon Impre&s;&s;ion upon my own Heart in particular.</P>
<P>When I was about Twelve, I was placed at a School called <HI>St. Mary de Cryps,</HI> in <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> the la&s;t G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">amma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> School I ever went to. Having a good Elocution and Memory, I was remark'd for my making Speeches before the Cor|poration at their annual Vi&s;itations: But I cannot &s;ay I felt any Drawings of GOD upon my Soul, for a Year or two, &s;aving, that I laid out &s;ome of the Money, that was given me on one of the fore-menti|oned Occa&s;ions, in Buying <HI>Ken's Manual for Winche&s;ter Scholars,</HI> a Book that had much affected me, when my Brother u&s;ed
<PB N="6" REF="004626_0010_100D868B1A557098">
to read it in my Mother's Troubles, and which, for &s;ome Time after I bought it, was of great Benefit to my Soul.</P>
<P>During the Time of my being at School, I was very fond of Reading Plays; and have kept from School for Days together, to prepare my&s;elf for acting them. My Ma&s;ter, &s;eeing how mine and my School-Fellows Vein run, compos'd Something of this Kind for us him&s;elf, and cau&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to dre&s;s my&s;elf in Girl's Cloaths (which I had often done) to act a Part before the Corporation; a Thing which ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> and, I tru&s;t, will &s;till cau&s;e me much Sorrow, even to the End of my Life.</P>
<P>For, though GOD brought Good af|terwards, even out of this Evil, as it was a Means of &s;trengthening my Memory, and teaching me a proper Ge&s;ture in Speaking; yet, this Way of Training up Youth, has a natural Tendency to de|bauch the Mind, to rai&s;e ill Pa&s;&s;ions, and to &s;tuff the Memory with Things as con|trary to the Go&s;pel of JESUS CHRIST as Darkne&s;s to Light, Hell to Heaven: How|ever, though the fir&s;t Thing I had to re|pent of, was my Education in general; yet, I mu&s;t always acknowledge, my par|ticular Thanks are due to my Ma&s;ter, for the great Pains he took with me and the other Scholars, in teaching us to &s;peak and write correctly.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="004626_0011_100D869095ABAF08">
Before I was Fifteen, having, as I thought, made a &s;ufficient Progre&s;s in the Cla&s;&s;icks, and &s;ecretly longing to be &s;et at Liberty from the Confinement of a School, I one Day told my Mother, &s;ince her Circum&s;tances would not permit to give me an Univer&s;ity Education, more Learn|ing, I thought, would &s;poil me for a Trade&s;man; and therefore I judg'd it be&s;t, not to learn Latin any longer. She at fir&s;t refu&s;ed to con&s;ent; but my Corruption &s;oon got the better of her good Nature. Hereupon, for &s;ome Time, I went to learn to write only. But my Mother's Circum|&s;tances being much on the Decline, and I being tractable that Way, I from Time to Time, began to a&s;&s;i&s;t her occa&s;ionally in the Publick Hou&s;e, till at length, I put on my blue Apron and my Snuffers, wa&s;h'd Mops, clean'd Rooms, and, in one Word, became a profe&s;&s;ed and common Drawer for near a Year and an half.</P>
<P>But he, who was with <HI>David</HI> when he was following the Sheep big with young, was with me even here. For notwith|&s;tanding I was thus employed in a com|mon Inn, and had &s;ometimes the Care of the whole Hou&s;e upon my Hands; yet I compo&s;ed two or three Sermons, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> one of them, in particular, to my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Brother. One Time, I remember,
<PB N="8" REF="004626_0012_100D86936B787AA0">
I was much pre&s;&s;ed to Self-Examination, and found my&s;elf very unwilling, at fir&s;t, to look into my Heart. And when a dear Youth (now with GOD) would of|ten come intreating me, when &s;erving at the Bar, to go to <HI>Oxon;</HI> my general An|&s;wer was, <HI>I wi&s;h I could.</HI></P>
<P>And He, that has promi&s;ed to fulfil the De&s;ires of them that fear him, was plea&s;ed to fulfil this De&s;ire his holy Spirit had put into my Heart.</P>
<P>When I had been employed above a Year in this &s;ervile Manner, my Mother was obliged to leave the Inn. My Bro|ther, who had been bred up for the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, married. All was made over to him. I being accu&s;tom'd to the Hou&s;e, it was agreed on all Hands, that I &s;hould continue there as an A&s;&s;i&s;tant. But GOD's Thoughts were not as our Thoughts; by his good Providence it happened, that my Si&s;ter-in-Law and I could by no Means agree; and at length the Re&s;ent|ment grew to &s;uch an Height, that my proud Heart would &s;carce &s;uffer me to &s;peak to her for three Weeks together: But, notwith&s;tanding I was much to blame, yet I u&s;ed to retire and weep, as <HI>Hagar</HI> did before the LORD, little think|ing, that GOD, by this Means, was forc|ing me out of the Publick-Bu&s;ine&s;s, and
<PB N="9" REF="004626_0013_100D86958A965B90">
calling me from drawing Wine for Drunkards, to draw Water out of the Wells of Salvation, for the Refre&s;hment of his &s;piritual <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> After continuing a long Time under this Burden of Mind, I at length re&s;olved, thinking my Ab&s;ence would make all Things ea&s;y, to go away: Accordingly, by the Advice of my Bro|ther, and Con&s;ent of my Mother, I went to &s;ee my elder Brother, then &s;ettled at <HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI></P>
<P>And here GOD was plea&s;ed to give me great Foreta&s;tes of his Love, and filled me with &s;uch un&s;peakable Raptures in <HI>St. John'</HI>s Church, that I was carried out even beyond my&s;elf. I felt great Hungrings and Thir&s;tings after the ble&s;&s;ed Sacra|ment, and wrote many pious Letters to my Mother, telling her, I would never go into the publick Employ again. <HI>Kem|pis</HI> was my great Delight, and I was al|ways impatient, till the Bell rung to call me to tread the Courts of the LORD'S Hou&s;e: But, in the Mid&s;t of the&s;e Illu|minations, &s;omething &s;ecretly whi&s;per'd, this would not la&s;t.</P>
<P>And indeed &s;o it happened: For (Oh that I could write it in Tears of Blood!) when I left <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> (as I did in about two Months) and returned to <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> I changed my Devotion with my Place.
<PB N="10" REF="004626_0014_100D869A82235148">
Alas, all my Fervour went off! I had no Inclination to go to Church or draw nigh unto GOD. In &s;hort, my Heart (tho' I had &s;o lately ta&s;ted of his Love) was far from him.</P>
<P>However, I had &s;o much Religion left, as to per&s;i&s;t in my Re&s;olution not to live in the Inn: And therefore my Mother gave me leave, tho' &s;he had but a little Income, to have a Bed upon the Ground, and live at her Hou&s;e, till Providence &s;hould point out a Place for me.</P>
<P>Having now, as I thought, Nothing to do, it was a proper Sea&s;on for Satan to tempt me. Much of my Time I &s;pent in reading Plays, and in &s;aunt'ring from Place to Place. I was careful to adorn my Body, but took little Pains to deck and beautify my Soul. Evil Communi|cations, with my old School-Fellows, &s;oon corrupted my good Manners. By &s;eeing their evil Practices, a Sen&s;e of the divine Pre&s;ence and pa&s;t Convictions in&s;en&s;ibly wore off my Mind; and I at length fell &s;ecretly into a Sin, for which <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> died; the di&s;mal Effects of which I have felt and groaned under ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>But GOD, who&s;e Gifts and Callings are without Repentance, would let No|thing pluck me out of his Hands, tho' I was continually oppo&s;ing the <HI>Spi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

Grace.</HI> He &s;aw me, with Pity and Com|pa&s;&s;ion, when lying in my Blood. He pa&s;&s;ed by me; He &s;aid unto me, LIVE; and even then gave me &s;ome Fore&s;ight of his Providing for me.</P>
<P>One Morning, as I was reading a Play to my Si&s;ter, &s;aid I, <HI>Si&s;ter, I believe GOD intends Something for me, which we know not of. As I have been diligent in Bu&s;ine&s;s, I believe many would gladly have me for an Apprentice; but every Way &s;eems to be barr'd up, &s;o that GOD, I think, will provide for me &s;ome Way or other.</HI></P>
<P>How I came to &s;ay the&s;e Words, I know not. GOD afterwards &s;hewed me they came from him; for, having lived thus with my Mother for a con&s;iderable time, a young Student, who was once a School-Fellow, and then a Servitor of <HI>Pembroke-College, Oxon,</HI> came to pay my Mother a Vi&s;it. Among other Conver|&s;ation he told her, how he had di&s;charged all College Expences that Quarter, and received a Penny. Upon this, my Mo|ther immediately cried out, <HI>That will do for me.</HI> Then turning to me, &s;he &s;aid, <HI>Will you go to</HI> Oxford, George? <HI>Yes,</HI> I replied, <HI>with all my Heart.</HI> Whereupon, having the &s;ame Friends as this Student had, my Mother, without Delay, waited upon them. They promi&s;ed their Intere&s;t
<PB N="12" REF="004626_0016_100D86A383139518">
to get me a Servitor's Place in the &s;ame College. She then applied to my old Ma&s;ter, who much approv'd of my com|ing to School again.</P>
<P>In about a Week I went and re-enter'd my&s;elf, and being grown pretty much in Stature, my Ma&s;ter addre&s;&s;ed me thus, <HI>I &s;ee</HI> George, <HI>you are advanced in Stature, but your better Part mu&s;t needs have gone back|wards.</HI> This made me blu&s;h. He &s;et me a proper Theme to tran&s;late into La|tin; and tho' I had made no Application to my Cla&s;&s;icks for &s;o long a Time, yet I had but one incon&s;iderable Fault in my Exerci&s;e. This, I believe, &s;omewhat &s;ur|prized my Ma&s;ter, and has afforded me Matter of Prai&s;e and Thanks ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>Being re-&s;ettled at School, I &s;pared no Pains to go forward in my Book. GOD was plea&s;ed to give me his Ble&s;&s;ing; and I learnt much fa&s;ter than ever I did be|fore.</P>
<P>All this while I continued in &s;ecret Sin; and at length got acquainted with a Set of &s;uch debauched, abandoned, athei&s;ti|cal Youths, that if GOD, by his free, unmerited, di&s;tingui&s;hing Grace, had not delivered me out of their Hands, I &s;hould, long &s;ince, have &s;at in the Scorner's Chair, My Thoughts of Religion, in&s;en&s;ibly grew more and more lax. I went to
<PB N="13" REF="004626_0017_100D86A60AB3DE40">
publick Service only to make Game and walk about. I took Plea&s;ure in their lewd Conver&s;ation. I began to rea&s;on, as they did; and to a&s;k, Why GOD had given me Pa&s;&s;ions, and not permitted me to gratify them? Not con&s;idering, that GOD did not, originally, give us the&s;e corrupt Pa&s;&s;ions; and that he had promi&s;|ed Help to with&s;tand them, if we would a&s;k it of him. In &s;hort, I &s;oon made a great Proficiency in the School of the Devil. I affected to look raki&s;h, and was in a fair Way of being as infamous as the wor&s;t of them.</P>
<P>But (Oh &s;tupendous Love!) GOD even here &s;topped me, when running on in a full Career to Hell. For, ju&s;t as I was upon the Brink of Ruin, he gave me &s;uch a Di&s;ta&s;te of their Principles and Practices, that I di&s;covered them to my Ma&s;ter, who &s;oon put a Stop to their Pro|ceedings.</P>
<P>Being thus delivered out of the Snares of the Devil, I began to be more and more &s;erious; and felt GOD convicting and working upon my Soul in &s;ome &s;mall Degree. One Day, as I was coming down Stairs, and overheard my Friends &s;peaking well of me, GOD &s;o deeply con|victed me of my Hypocri&s;y, that tho' I had formed frequent, but ineffectual Re&s;o|lutions
<PB N="14" REF="004626_0018_100D86AA93E8C570">

<P>Being now near the Seventeenth Year of my Age, I was re&s;olved to prepare my|&s;elf for the Holy Sacrament; which I re|ceived on Chri&s;tmas-Day. I began now to be more and more watchful over my Thoughts, Words and Actions: I kept the following Lent, Fa&s;ting <HI>Wedne&s;days</HI> and <HI>Fridays,</HI> thirty &s;ix Hours together. My Evenings (when I had done waiting upon my Mother) were generally &s;pent in Acts of Devotion, reading <HI>Drelincourt</HI> up|on Death, and other practical Books; and I con&s;tantly went to publick Wor&s;hip twice a Day.

<P>Near this Time I dream'd, That <HI>I was to &s;ee</HI> GOD <HI>on Mount</HI> Sinai; <HI>but was afraid to meet him.</HI> This made a great Impre&s;&s;ion upon me: A Gentlewoman to whom I told it, &s;aid, George <HI>this is a Call from</HI> GOD.</P>
<P>Still I grew more &s;erious after this Dream; but yet Hypocri&s;y crept into every Action. As once I affected to look more Raki&s;h, I now &s;trove to appear more Grave than really I was. However, an uncommon Concern and Alteration were vi&s;ible in my Behaviour. I often u&s;ed to find fault with the Lightne&s;s of others, and &s;ometimes took upon me to reprove my elder Brethren.</P>
<P>Not long after, as I was going one Night on an Errand for my Mother, an unac|countable, but very &s;trong Impre&s;&s;ion was made upon my Heart, that I &s;hould <HI>preach</HI> and <HI>print</HI> quickly. When I came home I innocently told my Mother what had befallen me: But &s;he (like <HI>Jo&s;eph'</HI>s Parents, when he told them his Dream) turning &s;hort upon me, cried out, <HI>What does the Boy mean?

For a Twelve-Month I went on in a Round of Duties, receiving the Sacrament monthly, Fa&s;ting frequently, attending con&s;tantly on publick Wor&s;hip, and Pray|ing often more than twice a Day in pri|vate. One of my Brothers u&s;ed to tell me, he fear'd this would not hold long, and that I would forget all when I came to <HI>Oxford.</HI> This Caution did me much Service; it fet me upon Praying to GOD for Per&s;everance: And, under GOD, the Preparation I made in the Country was an excellent Pre&s;ervative again&s;t tho&s;e mani|fold Temptations which be&s;et me at my fir&s;t coming to that Seat of Learning.</P>
<P>Being near Eighteen, it was judged a proper Time for my going to the Univer|&s;ity. GOD had &s;weetly prepared my Way.

<P>Soon after my Admi&s;&s;ion, I went to re|&s;ide (and found my being) at a Publick Hou&s;e was of Service to me: For, all the Servitors being &s;ick at my fir&s;t coming up, by my diligent and &s;peedy Attendance, I ingratiated my&s;elf into the Gentlemens

<P>I had not been long here, before I found the Benefit of the Foundation I had laid in the Country for a Holy Life. I was quick|ly &s;olicited to join with &s;everal, who lay in the &s;ame Room, in their Exce&s;s of Riot. GOD, in an&s;wer to my Prayers, gave me Grace to with&s;tand them; and, once in particular, it being cold, my Thighs were &s;o benumb'd by Sitting alone in my Study, becau&s;e I would not go out among&s;t them, that I could &s;carce &s;leep all Night. But I &s;oon found the Benefit of not Yielding: For, when they perceived they could not prevail, they let me alone for a &s;ingular, comical Fellow.</P>
<P>All this while I was not fully &s;atisfied of the Sin of Playing at Cards, and Reading of

<P>Before I went to the Univer&s;ity, I met with Mr. Law's <HI>Serious Call to a devout Life;</HI> but had not then Money enough to purcha&s;e it. Soon after my coming up to the Univer&s;ity, I &s;eeing a &s;mall Edition of it in a Friend's Hand, &s;oon procured it.

<P>I now began to pray and &s;ing P&s;alms thrice every Day, be&s;ides Morning and Evening; to fa&s;t every <HI>Friday;</HI> and to re|ceive the Sacrament at a Pari&s;h-Church near our College, and at the Ca&s;tle where the de&s;pi&s;ed <HI>Methodi&s;ts</HI> u&s;ed to receive once a Month.</P>

<P>The&s;e, tho' little, were u&s;eful Tryals. They inured me to Contempt, le&s;&s;en'd Self-Love, and taught me to die daily. My inward Sufferings were of a more un|common Nature. Satan &s;eemed to have de&s;ired me in particular, to &s;ift me as Wheat. GOD permitted him; for what Rea&s;on, I have &s;een already, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That his future Ble&s;&s;ings might not prove my Ruin.</P>
<P>Ever &s;ince my fir&s;t Awakenings to the divine Light, I felt a particular Hungring and Thir&s;ting after the Humility of JESUS CHRIST. Night and Day I prayed to be Partaker of that Grace; imagining the Habit of Humility would be in&s;tantane|ou&s;ly infus'd into my Soul. But as <HI>Gideon</HI> taught the Men of <HI>Succoth</HI> by Thorns, &s;o GOD (if I am yet in any Mea&s;ure ble&s;&s;ed with true Poverty of Spirit) taught it me by &s;trong Temptations.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved before, how I u&s;ed to be fa|vour'd with &s;en&s;ible Devotions. Tho&s;e Comforts were &s;oon withdrawn, and an horrible Fearfulne&s;s and Dread permitted to overwhelm my Soul. One Morning, in particular, ri&s;ing from my Bed, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> an unu&s;ual Oppre&s;&s;ion and Weight upon my Brea&s;t, attended with inward Darkne&s;s.
<PB N="29" REF="004626_0033_100D885DA3D468B8">
I applied to my Friend Mr. <HI>Charles We&s;ley.</HI> He advi&s;ed me to keep upon my Watch, and referr'd me to a Chapter in <HI>Kempis.</HI></P>
<P>In a &s;hort Time I perceived this Load gradually increa&s;ed, till it almo&s;t weighed me down; and as fully convinced me, that Satan had as real a Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion given him of my Body, as he had over <HI>Job'</HI>s. All Power of Meditating, or even Think|ing, was taken from me. My Memory quite fail'd me. My whole Soul was bar|ren and dry; and I could fancy my&s;elf to be like Nothing, &s;o much as a Man lock|ed up in Iron Armour.</P>
<P>Whenever I kneeled down, I felt great Heavings in my Body; and have often prayed under the Weight of them, till the Sweat came through me. At the&s;e Times Satan u&s;ed to terrify me much, and threatned to puni&s;h me if I di&s;cover|ed his Wiles. It being my Bu&s;ine&s;s, as Servitor, in my Turn, to knock at the Gentlemen's Rooms by Ten at Night, to &s;ee who were in their Rooms, I thought the Devil would appear to me every Stair I went up; and he &s;o troubled me when Play down to re&s;t, that for &s;ome Months I &s;carce &s;lept above three Hours in a Night.</P>
<P>GOD only knows how many Evenings I have lain upon my Bed, groaning under the Weight I felt, and bidding Satan

But GOD made Satan drive out Satan. For the&s;e Thoughts and Sugge&s;tions rai&s;ed &s;uch a Self-Abhorrence within me, that I never cea&s;ed wre&s;tling with GOD, till he ble&s;&s;ed me with a Victory over them. Self-Love, Self Will, Pride and Envy, &s;o buffeted me in their Turns, that I was re&s;olved either to die or conquer. I wanted to &s;ee Sin as it was; but feared, at the &s;ame Time, le&s;t the Sight of it &s;hould terrify me to Death.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t my <HI>inward</HI> Man was thus ex|erci&s;ed, my <HI>outward</HI> Man was not unem|ploy'd.

For In&s;tance, being check'd, for having, out of Pride, put down in my Diary what I gave away, Satan tempted me to lay my Diary quite a&s;ide. When <HI>Ca&s;taniza</HI> advi&s;ed to talk but little, Satan &s;aid I mu&s;t not talk at all: So that I, who u&s;ed to be mo&s;t forward in exhorting my Companions, have &s;at whole Nights without &s;peaking &s;carce any Thing.

<P>Further, as I daily got Strength by continued, tho' almo&s;t &s;ilent Prayer, in my Study, my Temptations grew &s;tron|ger, particularly for two or three Days before Deliverance came.

It being a very blu&s;terous, &s;tormy Night, it gave me awful Thoughts of the Day of Judgment. I continued, I think, till <HI>Great Tom</HI> called me Home. And finding &s;ome Reluctance in the na|tural Man again&s;t &s;taying &s;o long in the Cold, when I ro&s;e off my Knees, I fell a Rubbing my Hands, and ha&s;ted to Col|lege, &s;aying the&s;e Words, <HI>I am but a fre&s;h Water Soldier.</HI></P>

<P>About Three Days before Ordination, the Bi&s;hop came to Town; the Evening

after, I &s;ent his Lord&s;hip an Ab&s;tract of my private Examination upon the&s;e two Que&s;tions, <HI>Do you tru&s;t that you are in|wardly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">oved by the</HI> HOLY GHOST <HI>is take upon you this Office and Mini&s;tration?

<P>The next Morning I waited on the Bi|&s;hop in Per&s;on.

<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> I think was on Friday. The Day following I continued to &s;pend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">.

<P><PB N="59" REF="004626_0063_100D85DC5E5B9370">
On Sunday Morning I ro&s;e early, and prayed over St. <HI>Paul'</HI>s Epi&s;tle to <HI>Timothy,</HI> particularly that Precept, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> no one de&s;pi&s;e thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI> When I went up to the Altar, I could think of Nothing but <HI>Samuel</HI> &s;tanding before the LORD with a linnen Ephod. When the Bi&s;hop laid his Hands upon my Head, my Heart was melted down, and I offer'd up my whole Spirit, Soul and Body to the Service of GOD's Sanctuary. I read the Go&s;pel, at the Bi|&s;hop's Command, with <HI>Power;</HI> and af|terwards &s;ealed the good Confe&s;&s;ion I had made before many Witne&s;&s;es, with CHRIST's mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed Body.</P>
<P>Being re&s;trained, as was before ob&s;erved, I could not, tho' &s;ollicited thereto, preach in the Afternoon; but I read Prayers to the poor Pri&s;oners, being willing to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the fir&s;t Act of my mini&s;terial Office be an Act of <HI>Charity.</HI></P>
<P>The next Morning, waiting upon GOD in Prayer, to know what he would have me to do, the&s;e Words, <HI>Speak out Paul,</HI> came with great Power upon my Heart. Immediately my Heart was enlarged: GOD &s;pake to me by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Spirit; I was no longer dumb; I fini&s;hed a Sermon I had in Hand &s;ome time before; I began ano|ther, and preached, the Sunday following, to a very crowded Audience, with as much

Freedom as tho' I had been a Preacher for &s;ome Years.</P>
<P>Oh the un&s;peakable Benefit of Reading to the Poor, and exerci&s;ing our Talents while Students at the Univer&s;ity! Such previous Acts create excellent Habits, and make young Mini&s;ters not aukward, but apt to teach. It is remarkable our LORD &s;ent out his Apo&s;tles on &s;hort Mi&s;&s;ions, before they were &s;o &s;olemnly authorized at the Day of <HI>Penteco&s;t.</HI> Would Tutors of our Univer&s;ities follow his Example, and &s;end out their Pupils to vi&s;it the Sick and the Pri&s;oners, to pray with, and read practical Books of Piety to the Poor, they would find &s;uch Exerci&s;es of more Service to their Pupils and the Church of GOD, than all their private and publick Lectures put together.</P>
<P>But to come to a Conclu&s;ion. Thus GOD dealt with my Soul: And at the &s;ame Time he was not forgetful of my Body; for he inclined the Bi&s;hop's Heart to give me <HI>Five</HI> Guineas more; and by this Time; Quarter's Allowance way due to me from Sir <HI>John Philips,</HI> b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> which Sum put together, &s;erved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> well to defray the Expences of my <HI>Ordination,</HI> and taking my <HI>Batchelor's De|gree,</HI> which was conferr'd upon me at <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">|ford</HI> the Week after my being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

being then <HI>Twenty-one</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>Seven</HI> Months old.</P>
<P>The&s;e Changes from a <HI>Servitor</HI> to a <HI>Batchelor of Arts,</HI> from a common <HI>Draw|er</HI> to a <HI>Clergyman,</HI> were great Temptati|ons to think more highly of my&s;elf than I ought to think. Some were jealous over me, as I tru&s;t they always will be, with a godly Jealou&s;y. Hereby GOD, who is rich in Mercy, forwarned me of my Dan|ger, &s;tirred up my Heart to pray again&s;t &s;piritual Pride, and kept me, as I hope he will unto the End, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure hum|ble.</P>
<P>Thus did GOD, through a Variety of unfore&s;een Acts of <HI>Providence</HI> and <HI>Grace,</HI> train me up for, and at length introduced me into the Service of his Church. What has happened to me &s;ince that Time, e&s;pe|cially for the&s;e two la&s;t Years pa&s;t, is too notorious to need a Repetition. However, as I find Freedom in my&s;elf, and Lei&s;ure from my mini&s;terial Employ, hereafter (GOD willing) I &s;hall relate &s;ome Dealings of GOD with my Soul, and how he led me (without any Fore&s;ight of my own) into my pre&s;ent Way of Acting.</P>
