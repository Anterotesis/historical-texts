<P>As the Editor of this collection is con&s;cious there may ap|pear &s;ome defects in the arrangement of his materials, he thinks it nece&s;&s;ary to acquaint the Public with the true rea|&s;on of their appearing in a le&s;s fini&s;hed &s;tate than he could have wi&s;hed to pre&s;ent them. Some gentlemen of fortune and literary abilities had once conceived the &s;cheme of con|tributing to the entertainment and in&s;truction of the ri&s;ing generation by a &s;election of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting and improv|ing hi&s;tories from different authors. They intended to tran&s;|late from the different languages of Europe whatever might engage the minds of children to the improvement of their knowledge, and in&s;pire them with an early love of virtue. To the&s;e they were to have added a judicious &s;election from natural hi&s;tory, and the mo&s;t entertaining de&s;criptions that are to be found in the ample collection of modern voyages; together with many original pieces of their own compo&s;ition. All the&s;e it was pre&s;umed, would contribute a plea&s;ing and u&s;eful mi&s;cellany for the u&s;e of children, which they intended to have publi&s;hed in periodical numbers. After they had made &s;ome progre&s;s in the execution of this &s;cheme, they were compelled, by accidents which it is unnece&s;&s;ary to re|late, to abandon their de&s;ign. But, though the mode&s;ty of the authors would rather have led them to &s;uppre&s;s what they could not engage to fini&s;h, the Editor, to whom their papers were entru&s;ted, has judged them too valuable to be entirely &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. He has, therefore, collected them into a volume, with the hopes that this Mi&s;cellany may not ap|pear unde&s;erving of the public favour, and may be deemed no contemptible addition to that branch of literature which propo&s;es to it&s;elf the important object of plea&s;ing and in|&s;tructing children.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF LITTLE JACK.</HEAD>
<P>THERE was once a poor lame old man that lived in the mid&s;t of a wide uncultivated moor, in the north of England. He had for|merly been a &s;oldier, and had almo&s;t lo&s;t the u&s;e of one leg by a wound he had received in battle, when he was fighting again&s;t the enemies of his country This poor man, when he found him&s;elf thus di&s;abled, built a little hut of clay, which he covered with turf dug from the common. He had a little bit of ground which he made a &s;hift to cultivate with
<PB N="2" REF="030190_0006_0FE504219C18BBD8">
his own hands; and which &s;upplied him with potatoes and vegetables; be&s;ides this, he &s;ome|times gained a few halfpence by opening a gate for travellers, which &s;tood near his hou&s;e. He did not indeed get much, becau&s;e few people pa&s;&s;ed that way. What he earned was, how|ever, enough to purcha&s;e cloaths, and the few nece&s;&s;aries he wanted. But though poor, he was &s;trictly hone&s;t, and never failed night and morning to addre&s;s his prayers to God; by which means he was re&s;pected by all who knew him, much more than many who were &s;uperior to him in rank and fortune. This old man had one dome&s;tic. In his walks over the com|mon, he one day found a little kid that had lo&s;t its mother, and was almo&s;t fami&s;hed with hunger: he took it home to his cottage, fed it with the produce of his garden, and nur&s;ed it till it grew &s;trong and vigorous. Little Nan, (for that was the name he gave it) returned his cares with gratitude, and became as much at|tached to him as a dog. All day &s;he browzed upon the herbage that grew around his hut, and at night repo&s;ed upon the &s;ame bed of &s;traw with her ma&s;ter. Frequently did &s;he divert him with her innocent tricks and gambols. She would ne&s;tle her little head in his bo&s;om, and eat out of his hand part of his &s;canty al|lowance of bread; which he never failed to divide with his favourite. The old man often beheld her with &s;ilent joy, and, in the inno|cent effu&s;ions of his heart, would lift his hands to heaven, and thank the Deity, that, even in the mid&s;t of poverty and di&s;tre&s;s, had rai&s;ed him up one faithful friend.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="030190_0007_0FE503C7E047A048">
One night, in the beginning of winter, the old man thought he heard the feeble cries and lamentations of a child. As he was naturally charitable, he aro&s;e and &s;truck a light, and, going out of his cottage, examined on every &s;ide. It was not long before he di&s;cerned an infant, which had probably been dropped by &s;ome &s;trolling beggar or gyp&s;y. The old man &s;tood amazed at the &s;ight, and knew not what to do. Shall I, &s;aid he, who find it &s;o diffi|cult to live at pre&s;ent, incumber my&s;elf with the care of an helple&s;s infant, that will not for many years be capable of contributing to its own &s;ub&s;i&s;tence? And yet, added he, &s;oftening with pity, can I deny a&s;&s;i&s;tance to an human being &s;till more mi&s;erable than my&s;elf?&mdash;Will not that Providence which feeds the birds of the wood and the bea&s;ts of the field, and which has promi&s;ed to ble&s;s all tho&s;e that are kind and charitable, a&s;&s;i&s;t my feeble endeavours?&mdash;At lea&s;t, let me give it food and lodging for this night; for without I receive it into my cot|tage, the poor abandoned wretch mu&s;t peri&s;h with cold before the morning. Saying this, he took it up in his arms, and perceived it was a fine healthy boy, though covered with rags; the little foundling too &s;eemed to be &s;en&s;ible of his kindne&s;s, and &s;miling in his face, &s;tretch|ed out his little arms, as if to embrace his benefactor.</P>
<P>When he had brought it into his hut, he began to be extremely embarra&s;&s;ed how to pro|cure it food: but looking at Nan, he recol|lected that &s;he had ju&s;t lo&s;t her kid, and &s;aw her udder di&s;tended with milk: he, therefore,
<PB N="4" REF="030190_0008_0FE50423260D8FD8">
called her to him, and, pre&s;enting the child to the teat, was overjoyed to find, that it &s;ucked as naturally as if it had really found a mother. The goat too &s;eemed to receive plea&s;ure from the efforts of the child, and &s;ubmitted without oppo&s;ition to di&s;charge the duties of a nur&s;e. Contented with this experiment, the old man wrapped the child up as warmly as he could, and &s;tretched him&s;elf out to re&s;t with the con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having done an humane action. Early the next morning he was awakened by the cries of the child for food, which with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his faithful Nan, he &s;uckled as he had done the night before. And now the old man began to feel an intere&s;t in the child, which made him defer &s;ome time longer the taking mea&s;ures to be delivered from its care. Who knows, &s;aid he, but Providence which has pre|&s;erved this child in &s;o wonderful a manner, may have de&s;tined it to &s;omething equally won|derful in his future life; and may ble&s;s me as the humble agent of his decrees? At lea&s;t, as he grows bigger, he will be a plea&s;ure and comfort to me, in this lonely cabin, and will a&s;&s;i&s;t in cutting turf for fuel, and cultivating the gar|den. From this time he became more and more attached to the little foundling; who, in a &s;hort time, learned to con&s;ider the old man as a pa|rent, and delighted him with its innocent ca|re&s;&s;es. Gentle Nanny too, the goat, &s;eemed to adopt him with equal tenderne&s;s as her off|&s;pring: &s;he would &s;tretch her&s;elf out upon the ground, while he crawled upon his hands and knees towards her; and when he had &s;atisfied
<PB N="5" REF="030190_0009_0FE503C9C8E89FD8">
his hunger by &s;ucking, he would ne&s;tle between her legs and go to &s;leep in her bo&s;om.</P>
<P>It was wonderful to &s;ee how this child, thus left to nature, increa&s;ed in &s;trength and vigour. Unfettered by bandages or re&s;traints, his limbs acquired their due proportions and form; his countenance was full and florid, and gave indi|cations of perfect health; and, at an age when other children are &s;carcely able to &s;upport them|&s;elves with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a nur&s;e, this little foundling could run alone. It was true, that he &s;ometimes failed in his attempts, and fell to the ground; but the ground was &s;oft, and little Jack, for &s;o the old man called him, was not tender or delicate; he never minded thumps or brui&s;es, but boldly &s;crambled up again and pur|&s;ued his way. In a &s;hort time, little Jack was completely ma&s;ter of his legs; and as the &s;um|mer came on, he attended his mamma, the
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="6" REF="030190_0010_0FE50426E52DEDD8">
goat, upon the common, and u&s;ed to play with her for hours together; &s;ometimes rolling under her belly, now climbing upon her back, and fri&s;king about as if he had really been a kid. As to his cloathing, Jack was not much incum|bered with it; he had neither &s;hoes, nor &s;tock|ings, nor &s;hirt; but the weather was warm, and Jack felt him&s;elf &s;o much lighter for every kind of exerci&s;e. In a &s;hort time after this, Jack began to imitate the &s;ounds of his papa the man, and his mamma the goat; nor was it long before he learned to &s;peak articulately. The old man delighted with this fir&s;t dawn of rea&s;on, u&s;ed to place him upon his knee, and conver&s;e with him for hours together, while his pottage was &s;lowly boiling amid the embers of a turf fire. As he grew bigger, Jack became of con&s;ider|able u&s;e to his father; he could tru&s;t him to look after the gate, and open it during his ab|&s;ence: and, as to the cookery of the family, it was not long before Jack was a complete pro|ficient, and could make broth almo&s;t as well as his daddy him&s;elf. During the winter nights, the old man u&s;ed to entertain him with &s;tories of what he had &s;een during his youth; the battles and &s;ieges he had been witne&s;s to, and the hard&s;hips he had undergone; all this he related with &s;o much vivacity that Jack was never tired of li&s;tening. But what delighted him beyond mea&s;ure was to &s;ee daddy &s;houlder his crutch, in&s;tead of a mu&s;ket, and give the word of command. To the right&mdash;to the left&mdash;pre&s;ent&mdash;&s;ire&mdash;march&mdash;halt&mdash;all this was familiar to Jack's ear as &s;oon as he could &s;peak, and before he was &s;ix years old, he poized and
<PB N="7" REF="030190_0011_0FE503CC86E26BB0">
pre&s;ented a broom-&s;tick, which his daddy gave him for that purpo&s;e, with as good a grace as any &s;oldier of his age in Europe.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>The old man too in&s;tructed him in &s;uch plain and &s;imple morals and religion, as he was able to explain. "Never tell an untruth, Jack, &s;aid he, even though you were to be flayed alive; a &s;oldier never lies." Jack held up his head, marched acro&s;s the floor, and promi&s;ed his daddy that he would always tell the truth like a &s;oldier. But the old man, as he was &s;omething of a &s;cholar, had a great ambition that his darling &s;hould learn to read, and write; and this was a work of &s;ome diffi|culty; for he had neither printed book, nor pens, nor paper in his cabin. Indu&s;try, how|ever, enables us to overcome difficulties; in the &s;ummer time, as the old man &s;at before his cot|tage, he would draw letters in the &s;and, and
<PB N="8" REF="030190_0012_0FE50430504A6130">
teach Jack to name them &s;ingly, until he was acquainted with the whole alphabet, he then proceeded to &s;yllables; and after that to words; all which his little pupil learned to pronounce with great facility: and, as he had a &s;trong propen&s;ity to imitate what he &s;aw, he not only acquired the power of reading words, cut of tracing all the letters which compo&s;ed them, on the &s;and.</P>
<P>About this time, the poor goat which had nur&s;ed Jack &s;o faithfully, grew ill and died. He tended her with the greate&s;t affection and a&s;&s;iduity during her illne&s;s, brought her the fre&s;he&s;t herbs for food, and would frequently &s;upport her head for hours together upon his little bo&s;om. But it was all in vain; he lo&s;t his poor mammy, as he u&s;ed to call her, and was for &s;ome time incon&s;olable; for Jack, though his knowledge was bounded, had an uncommon degree of gratitude and affection in his temper. He was not able to talk as finely about love, tenderne&s;s, and &s;en&s;ibility, as many other little boys, that have enjoyed greater ad|vantages of education; but he felt the reality of them in his heart, and thought it &s;o natural to love every thing that loves us, that he never even &s;u&s;pected it was po&s;&s;ible to do otherwi&s;e. The poor goat was buried in the old man's garden, and thither little Jack would often come and call upon his poor mammy Nan, and a&s;k her why &s;he had left him? One day, as he was thus employed, a lady happened to come by in a carriage, and overheard him before he was aware. Jack ran in an in&s;tant to open the
<PB N="9" REF="030190_0013_0FE503D5728AB498">
gate; but the lady &s;topped, and a&s;ked him whom he was bemoaning &s;o pitifully, and calling
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
upon? Jack an&s;wered, that it was his poor mammy, that was buried in the garden. The lady thought it very odd to hear of &s;uch a bu|rial place, and therefore proceeded to que&s;tion him, "How did your mammy get her living?" &s;aid &s;he. "She u&s;ed to graze here upon the common all day long," &s;aid Jack. The lady was &s;till more a&s;toni&s;hed; but the old man came out of his hut, and explained the whole affair to her, which &s;urpri&s;ed her very much; for though this lady had &s;een a great deal of the world, and had read a variety of books, it had ne|ver once entered into her head that a child might grow &s;trong and vigorous by &s;ucking a goat, in&s;tead of eating pap. She therefore looked at Jack with amazement, admired his brown but animated face, and prai&s;ed his &s;hape and acti|vity.
<PB N="10" REF="030190_0014_0FE504324D70A0C8">
"Will you go with me, little boy, &s;aid &s;he, and I will take care of you, if you behave well?" "No, &s;aid Jack, I mu&s;t &s;tay with daddy; he has taken care of me for many years, and now I mu&s;t take care of him; otherwi&s;e I &s;hould like very well to go with &s;uch a &s;weet, good-natured lady." The lady was not di&s;plea&s;ed with Jack's an&s;wer, and putting her hand in her pocket, gave him half a crown, to buy him &s;hoes and &s;tockings, and pur&s;ued her jour|ney.</P>
<P>Jack was not unacquainted with the u&s;e of money, as he had been often &s;ent to the next village to purcha&s;e bread and nece&s;&s;aries; but he was totally unacquainted with the u&s;e of &s;hoes and &s;tockings, which he had never worn in his life, or felt the want of. The next day, however, the old man bade him run to town, and lay his money out as the lady had de&s;ired; for he had too much honour to think of di&s;obeying her commands, or &s;uffering it to be expended for any other purpo&s;e. It was not long before Jack returned; but the old man was much &s;ur|pri&s;ed to &s;ee him come back as bare as he went out. "Heigh, Jack! &s;aid he, where are the &s;hoes and &s;tockings which you were to pur|cha&s;e?" "Daddy, an&s;wered Jack, I went to the &s;hop, and ju&s;t tried a pair for &s;port, but I found them &s;o cumber&s;ome, that I could not walk, and I would not wear &s;uch things, even if the lady would give me another half crown for doing it; &s;o I laid the money out in a warm jacket for you, becau&s;e the winter is coming on, and you &s;eem to be more afraid of the cold than formerly." Many &s;uch in&s;tances
<PB N="11" REF="030190_0015_0FE503D738460D38">
of conduct did Jack di&s;play; from which it was ea&s;y to perceive, that he had an excellent &s;oul, and generous temper. One failing, in|deed Jack was liable to; though a very good natured boy, he was a little too jealous of his honour. His daddy had taught him the u&s;e of his hands and legs, and Jack had &s;uch di&s;po&s;i|tions for the art of boxing, that he could beat every boy in the neighbourhood, of his age and &s;ize. Even if they were a head taller, it made no difference to Jack, provided they &s;aid any thing to wound his honour; for otherwi&s;e he was the mo&s;t mild, pacific creature in the world. One day that he had been &s;ent to the village, he returned with his eyes black, and his face &s;welled to a frightful &s;ize: it was even with difficulty that he was able to walk at all, &s;o &s;ore was he with the pomelling he had receiv|ed. "What have you been doing now, Jack?" &s;aid the old man.&mdash;"Only fighting with Dick the butcher." "You rogue, &s;aid the old man, he is twice as big as you are, and the be&s;t fighter in all the country." "What does that &s;ignify, &s;aid Jack, he called you an old beggarman, and then I &s;truck him; and I will &s;trike him again whenever he calls you &s;o, even if he &s;hould beat me to pieces; for you know, daddy, that you are not a beggarman, but a &s;oldier."</P>
<P>In this manner lived little Jack, until he was twelve years old; at this time his poor old daddy fell &s;ick and became incapable of moving about. Jack did every thing he could think of for the poor man; he made him broths, he fed him with his own hands, he watched whole nights by his bed-&s;ide &s;upporting his head and helping
<PB N="12" REF="030190_0016_0FE50433D6DF3D68">
him when he wanted to move. But it was all in vain; his poor daddy grew daily wor&s;e, and perceived it to be impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould re|cover. He one day therefore called little Jack to his bed-&s;ide, and pre&s;&s;ing his hand affection|ately, told him that he was ju&s;t going to die. Little Jack bur&s;t into a flood of tears at this information, but his daddy de&s;ired him to compo&s;e him&s;elf, and attend to the la&s;t advice
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
he &s;hould be able to give him. "I have lived, &s;aid the old man, a great many years, in po|verty, but I do not know that I have been wor&s;e off than if I had been rich. I have avoided, perhaps, many faults, and many unea&s;ine&s;&s;es, which I &s;hould have incurred had I been in another &s;ituation; and though I have often wanted a meal and always &s;ared hard, I have enjoyed as much health and life as u&s;ually falls to the lot of my betters. I am now going to
<PB N="13" REF="030190_0017_0FE503BB354928B8">
die; I feel it in every part; the breath will &s;oon be out of my body; then I &s;hall be put in the ground, and the worms will eat your poor old daddy." At this Jack renewed his tears and &s;obbings, for he was unable to re&s;train them. But the old man &s;aid; "Have patience, my child; though I &s;hould leave this world, as I have always been &s;trictly hone&s;t and endea|voured to do my duty, I do not doubt but God will pity me, and convey me to a better place; where I &s;hall be happier than I have ever been here. This is what I have always taught you, and this belief gives me the greate&s;t comfort in my la&s;t moments. The only regret I feel, is for you, my deare&s;t child, whom I leave unprovi|ded for. But you are &s;trong and vigorous, and almo&s;t able to get your living. As &s;oon as I am dead, you mu&s;t go to the next village and inform the people, that they may come and bury me. You mu&s;t then endeavour to get into &s;ervice, and work for your living; and, if you are &s;trictly hone&s;t and &s;ober, I do not doubt that you will find a livelihood, and that God, who is the common father of all, will protect and ble&s;s you. Adieu, my child, I grow faint|er and fainter; never forget your poor old daddy, nor the example he has &s;et you; but in every &s;ituation of life di&s;charge your duty, and live like a Soldier, and a Chri&s;tian." When the old man had with difficulty uttered the&s;e la&s;t in&s;tructions, his voice entirely failed him, his limbs grew cold and &s;tiff, and in a few mi|nutes he expired without a groan. Little Jack, who hung crying over his daddy, called upon him in vain, in vain endeavoured to revive
<PB N="14" REF="030190_0018_0FE5043570FCC198">
him. At length he pulled off his cloaths, went into his daddy's bed, and endeavoured for many hours to animate him with the warmth of his own body; but finding all his endeavours fruit|le&s;s, he concluded that he was indeed dead; and therefore, weeping bitterly, he dre&s;t him|&s;elf, and went to the village as he had been or|dered. The poor little boy was thus left en|tirely de&s;titute and knew not what to do; but one of the farmers, who had been acquainted with him before, offered to take him into his hou&s;e, and give him his victuals, for a few months, till he could find a &s;ervice. Jack thankfully accepted the offer, and &s;erved him faithfully for &s;everal months; during which time he learned to milk, to drive the plough, and never refu&s;ed any kind of work he was able to perform. But, by ill luck, this good-natu|red farmer contracted a fever, by over-heating him&s;elf in the harve&s;t, and died in the begin|ning of winter. His wife was therefore obliged to di&s;charge her &s;ervants, and Jack was again turned loo&s;e upon the world, with only his cloaths, and a &s;hilling in his pocket, which his kind mi&s;tre&s;s had made him a pre&s;ent of. He was very &s;orry for the lo&s;s of his ma&s;ter; but he was now grown bigger and &s;tronger, and thought he &s;hould ea&s;ily find employment. He therefore &s;et out upon his travels, walking all day, and inquiring at every farm-hou&s;e for work. But in this attempt he was unfortu|nate, for nobody cho&s;e to employ a &s;tranger: and though he lived with the greate&s;t econo|my, he &s;oon found him&s;elf in a wor&s;e &s;ituation than ever, without a farthing in his pocket, or
<PB N="15" REF="030190_0019_0FE503D8CF654CA8">
a mor&s;el of bread to eat. Jack, however, was not of a temper to be ea&s;ily ca&s;t down; he walk|ed re&s;olutely on all day, but towards evening was overtaken by a violent &s;torm of rain, which wetted him to the &s;kin before he could find a bu&s;h for &s;helter. Now, poor Jack began to think of his old daddy, and the comforts he had formerly enjoyed upon the common, where he had always a roof to &s;helter him, and a &s;lice of bread for &s;upper. But tears and lamenta|tions were vain; and therefore, as &s;oon as the &s;torm was over, he pur&s;ued his journey, in hopes of finding &s;ome barn or out-hou&s;e to creep into for the re&s;t of the night. While he was thus wandering about, he &s;aw at &s;ome di&s;|tance a great light, which &s;eemed to come from &s;ome prodigious fire. Jack did not know what this could be; but, in his pre&s;ent &s;itua|tion, he thought a fire no di&s;agreeable object, and therefore determined to approach it. When he came nearer, he &s;aw a large build|ing which &s;eemed to &s;pout fire and &s;moke at &s;everal openings, and heard an ince&s;&s;ant noi&s;e of blows, and the rattling of chains. Jack was at fir&s;t a little frightened, but &s;ummoning all his courage, he crept cautiou&s;ly on to the building, and looking through a chink, di&s;co|vered &s;everal men and boys employed in blow|ing fires and hammering burning ma&s;&s;es of iron. This was a very comfortable &s;ight to him in his pre&s;ent forlorn condition; &s;o finding a door half open, he ventured in, and placed him&s;elf as near as he dared to one of the flaming fur|naces. It was not long before he was di&s;co|vered by one of the workmen, who a&s;ked him,
<FIGURE>
<PB N="16" REF="030190_0020_0FE50440EBAD51F8">
</FIGURE>
roughly, what bu&s;ine&s;s he had there? Jack an|&s;wered with great humility, that he was a poor boy, looking out for work; that he had had no food all day, and was wet to the &s;kin with the rain, which was evident enough from the appearance of his cloaths. By great good luck, the man he &s;poke to was good-natured, and therefore not only permitted him to &s;tay by the fire, but gave him &s;ome broken victuals for his &s;upper. After this, he laid him&s;elf down in a corner, and &s;lept without di&s;turbance till morning. He was &s;carcely awake the next day, when the ma&s;ter of the forge came in to overlook his men, who finding Jack, and hear|ing his &s;tory, began to reproach him as a lazy vagabond, and a&s;ked him why he did not work for his living. Jack a&s;&s;ured him there was nothing he &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ired, and that if he would plea&s;e to employ him, there was nothing
<PB N="17" REF="030190_0021_0FE503DBA3B1BDB8">
that he would not do to earn a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Well, my boy, &s;aid the ma&s;ter, if this is true, you &s;hall &s;oon be tried; nobody need be idle here; &s;o calling his foreman, he ordered him to &s;et that lad to work, and pay him in pro|portion to his de&s;erts. Jack now thought him|&s;elf completely happy, and worked with &s;o much a&s;&s;iduity, that he &s;oon gained a com|fortable livelihood, and acquired the e&s;teem of his ma&s;ter. But unfortunately, he was a little too unre&s;erved in his conver&s;ation, and com|municated the &s;tory of his former life and edu|cation. This was great matter of diver&s;ion to all the other boys of the forge; who, when|ever they were inclined to be merry, would call him little Jack the beggar-boy, and imi|tate the baaing of a goat. This was too much for his ira&s;cible temper, and he never failed to re&s;ent it; by which means he was engaged in continual quarrels and combats, to the great di&s;turbance of the hou&s;e; &s;o that his ma&s;ter, though in other re&s;pects perfectly &s;atisfied with his behaviour, began to fear that he &s;hould at la&s;t be obliged to di&s;charge him.</P>
<P>It happened one day, that a large company of gentlemen and ladies were introduced to &s;ee the works. The ma&s;ter attended them, and explained, with great politene&s;s, every part of his manufacture. They viewed with a&s;toni&s;h|ment the different methods by which that u&s;e|ful and nece&s;&s;ary ore of iron is rendered &s;it for human u&s;e. They examined the furnaces where it is melted down, to di&s;engage it from the dro&s;s, with which it is mixed in the bowels of the earth, and whence it runs down in liquid
<FIGURE>
<PB N="18" REF="030190_0022_0FE50442EBD14518">
</FIGURE>
torrents like fire. They beheld with equal plea|&s;ure the prodigious hammers which, moved by the force of water, mould it into ma&s;&s;y bars, for the &s;ervice of man. While they were bu&s;y in examining the&s;e different proce&s;&s;es, they were alarmed by a &s;udden noi&s;e of di&s;cord, which broke out on the other &s;ide of the build|ing; and the ma&s;ter inquiring into the cau&s;e, was told, that it was only little Jack, who was fighting with Tom the collier. At this, the ma&s;ter cried out, in a pa&s;&s;ion, there is no peace to be expected in the furnace, while that little ra&s;cal is employed; &s;end him to me, and I will in&s;tantly di&s;charge him. At this moment Jack appeared, all covered with blood and dirt, and &s;tood before his angry judge in a mode&s;t, but re&s;olute po&s;ture. "Is this the reward, &s;aid his ma&s;ter, you little audacious vagabond, of all my kindne&s;s? Can you never refrain a &s;ingle in|&s;tant
<FIGURE>
<PB N="19" REF="030190_0023_0FE503E350B8A7A8">
</FIGURE>
from broils and fighting? But I am deter|mined to bear it no longer; and therefore you &s;hall never, from this hour, do a &s;ingle &s;troke of work for me." "Sir, replied Jack, with great humility, but yet with firmne&s;s, I am extremely &s;orry to have di&s;obliged you, nor have I ever done it willingly, &s;ince I have been here; and if the other boys would only mind their bu&s;ine&s;s as well as I do, and not mole&s;t me, you would not have been offended now; for I defy them all to &s;ay, that &s;ince I have been in the hou&s;e, I have ever given any one the lea&s;t provocation, or ever refu&s;ed to the utmo&s;t of my &s;trength, to do whatever I have been ordered." "That's true, in good faith, &s;aid the foreman; I mu&s;t do little Jack the ju&s;tice to &s;ay that there is not a more hone&s;t, &s;ober, and indu&s;trious lad about the place. Set him to what you will, he never &s;culks, never grumbles, never &s;lights his work;
<PB N="20" REF="030190_0024_0FE50444740B6128">
and if it were not for a little pa&s;&s;ion and fight|ing, I don't believe there would be his fellow in England." "Well, &s;aid the ma&s;ter a little molli|fied, but what is the cau&s;e of all this &s;udden di&s;|turbance?" "Sir, an&s;wered Jack, it is Tom that has been abu&s;ing me and telling me that my fa|ther was a beggarman and my mother a nanny-goat; and when I de&s;ired him to be quiet, he went baaing all about the hou&s;e; and this I could not bear; for as to my poor father he was an hone&s;t &s;oldier, and if I did &s;uck a goat, &s;he was the be&s;t creature in the world, and I won't hear her abu&s;ed while I have any &s;trength in my body." At this harangue, the whole audience were &s;carcely able to refrain from laughing, and the ma&s;ter, with more compo&s;ure, told Jack to mind his bu&s;ine&s;s, and threatened the other boys with puni&s;hment, if they di&s;turbed him.</P>
<P>But a lady who was in company &s;eemed par|ticularly intere&s;ted about little Jack, and when &s;he had heard his &s;tory, &s;aid, this mu&s;t certainly be the little boy who opened a gate &s;everal years pa&s;t for me upon Norcot Moor. I remember being &s;truck with his appearance, and hearing him lament the lo&s;s of the goat that nur&s;ed him. I was very much affected with his hi&s;|tory, and &s;ince he de&s;erves &s;o good a character, if you will part with him, I will in&s;tantly take him into my &s;ervice. The ma&s;ter replied, that he &s;hould part with him with great &s;atisfaction to &s;uch an excellent mi&s;tre&s;s; that indeed the boy de&s;erved all the commendations which had been given; but &s;ince the other lads had &s;uch an habit of plaguing, and Jack was of &s;o impa|tient a temper, he de&s;paired of ever compo&s;ing
<PB N="21" REF="030190_0025_0FE503E617AB5B50">
their animo&s;ities. Jack was then called, and informed of the lady's offer, which he in&s;tantly accepted with the greate&s;t readine&s;s, and re|ceived immediate directions to her hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Jack was now in a new &s;phere of life. His face was wa&s;hed, his hair combed, he was clo|thed afre&s;h, and appeared a very &s;mart active lad. His bu&s;ine&s;s was, to help in the &s;table, to water the hor&s;es, to clean &s;hoes, to perform errands, and to do all the jobs of the family; and in the di&s;charge of the&s;e &s;ervices, he &s;oon gave univer&s;al &s;atisfaction. He was indefati|gable in doing what he was ordered, never grum|bled, or appeared out of temper, and &s;eemed &s;o quiet and inoffen&s;ive in his manners, that every body wondered how he had acquired the cha|racter of being quarrel&s;ome. In a &s;hort time, he became both the favourite and the drudge of the whole family; for, &s;peak but kindly to him and call him a little &s;oldier, and Jack was at every one's di&s;po&s;al. This was Jack's par|ticular foible and vanity; at his lei&s;ure hours, he would divert him&s;elf by the hour together, in poizing a dung fork, charging with a broom &s;tick, and &s;tanding centry at the &s;table door. Another propen&s;ity of Jack's, which now di&s;|covered it&s;elf, was an immoderate love of hor&s;es. The in&s;tant he was introduced into the &s;table, he attached him&s;elf &s;o &s;trongly to the&s;e animals, that you would have taken him for one of the &s;ame &s;pecies, or at lea&s;t a near rela|tion. Jack was never tired with rubbing down and currying them; the coachman had &s;carcely any bu&s;ine&s;s but to &s;it upon his box; all the operations of the &s;table were intru&s;ted to little
<PB N="22" REF="030190_0026_0FE504470C7AE688">
Jack, nor was it ever known that he neglected a &s;ingle particular. But what gave him more plea&s;ure than all the re&s;t, was &s;ometimes to ac|company his mi&s;tre&s;s upon a little hor&s;e, which he managed with infinite dexterity.</P>
<P>Jack too di&s;covered a great di&s;po&s;ition for all the u&s;eful and mechanic arts. He had &s;erved an apprentice&s;hip already to the manufactory of iron, and of this he was almo&s;t as vain as being a &s;oldier. As he began to extend his know|ledge of the world, he &s;aw that nothing could be done without iron. How would you plough the ground, &s;aid Jack; how would you dig your garden; how would you even light a fire, dre&s;s a dinner, &s;hoe a hor&s;e, or do the lea&s;t thing in the world, if we workmen at the forge did not take the trouble of preparing it for you? Thus Jack would &s;ometimes expatiate upon the dignity and importance of his own profe&s;&s;ion, to the great admiration of all the other &s;er|vants.</P>
<P>The&s;e ideas naturally gave Jack a great e&s;teem for the profe&s;&s;ion of a black&s;mith, and in his occa&s;ional vi&s;its to the forge with the hor&s;es, he learnt to make and fix a &s;hoe as neatly as any arti&s;t in the country.</P>
<P>Nor were Jack's talents confined to the ma|nufactory of iron; his love of hor&s;es was &s;o great, and his intere&s;t in every thing that rela|ted to them, that it was not long before he acquired a very competent knowledge in the art of &s;addlery.</P>
<P>Jack would al&s;o &s;ometimes ob&s;erve the car|penters when they were at work, and &s;ometimes by &s;tealth attempt the management of their
<FIGURE>
<PB N="23" REF="030190_0027_0FE503E7A0FFD0A0">
</FIGURE>
tools; in which he &s;ucceeded as well as in every thing el&s;e; &s;o that he was looked upon by every body as a very active, ingenious boy.</P>
<P>There was in the family, where he now lived, a young gentleman, the nephew of his mi&s;tre&s;s, who had lo&s;t his parents, and was therefore brought up by his aunt. As Ma&s;ter Willets was &s;omething younger than Jack, and a very good-natured boy, he &s;oon began to take notice of him, and be much diverted with his com|pany. Jack, indeed, was not unde&s;erving this attention; for although he could not boa&s;t any great advantages of education, his conduct was entirely free from all the vices to which &s;ome of the lower cla&s;s of people are &s;ubject. Jack was never heard to &s;wear, or expre&s;s him&s;elf with any indecency. He was civil and re&s;pect|ful in his manners to all his &s;uperiors, and uni|formly good-natured to his equals. In re&s;pect
<PB N="24" REF="030190_0028_0FE5045321639F68">
to the animals entru&s;ted to his care, he not only refrained from u&s;ing them ill, but was never tired with doing them good offices. Add|ed to this, he was &s;ober, temperate, hardy, active, and ingenious, and de&s;pi&s;ed a lie as much as any of his betters. Ma&s;ter Willets now began to be much plea&s;ed with playing at cric|ket and trap-ball with Jack, who excelled at both the&s;e games. Ma&s;ter Willets had a little hor&s;e which Jack looked after; and not con|tented with looking after him in the be&s;t man|ner, he u&s;ed to ride him at his lei&s;ure hours with &s;o much care and addre&s;s, that in a &s;hort time he made him the mo&s;t gentle and docile little animal in the country. Jack had acquired this knowledge partly from his own experience, and partly from paying particular attention to an itinerant riding-ma&s;ter that had lately ex|hibited various feats in that neighbourhood. Jack attended him &s;o clo&s;ely, and made &s;o good
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="25" REF="030190_0029_0FE503EA53817C08">
an u&s;e of his time, that he learned to imitate almo&s;t every thing he &s;aw, and u&s;ed to divert the &s;ervants and his young ma&s;ter with acting the tailor's riding to Brentford.</P>
<P>The young gentleman had a ma&s;ter who u&s;ed to come three times a week to teach him ac|counts, and writing, and geography. Jack u&s;ed to be &s;ometimes in the room while the le&s;&s;ons were given, and li&s;tened according to cu&s;tom with &s;o much attention to all that pa&s;s|ed, that he received very con&s;iderable advan|tage for his own improvement. He had now a little money, and he laid &s;ome of it out to pur|cha&s;e pens and paper and a &s;late, with which at night he u&s;ed to imitate every thing he had heard and &s;een in the day: and his little ma&s;|ter, who began to love him very &s;incerely, when he &s;aw him &s;o de&s;irous of improvement, con|trived, under one pretence or another, to have him generally in the room while he was receiv|ing in&s;truction him&s;elf.</P>
<P>In this manner Jack went on for &s;ome years, leading a life very agreeable to him&s;elf, and di&s;charging his duty very much to the &s;atisfac|tion of his mi&s;tre&s;s. An unlucky accident at length happened to interrupt his tranquility. A young gentleman came down to vi&s;it Ma&s;ter. Willets, who, having been educated in France, and among genteel people in London, had a very great ta&s;te for finery, and a &s;upreme con|tempt for all the vulgar. His dre&s;s too was a little particular, as well as his manners; for he &s;pent half his time in adju&s;ting his head, wore a large black bag tied to his hair behind, and would &s;ometimes &s;trut about for half an hour together
<PB N="26" REF="030190_0030_0FE50454B929CDE8">
with his hat under his arm, and a little &s;word
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
by his &s;ide. This young man had a &s;upreme contempt for all the vulgar, which he did not attempt to conceal; and when he had heard the &s;tory of Jack's birth and education, he could &s;carcely bear to be in the &s;ame room with him. Jack &s;oon perceived the aver&s;ion which the &s;tranger entertained for him, and at fir&s;t endea|voured to remove it, by every civility in his power; but when he found that he gained no|thing by all his humility, his temper, natu|rally haughty, took fire, and, as far as he dared, he plainly &s;howed all the re&s;entment he felt.</P>
<P>It happened one day, after Jack had receiv|ed &s;ome very mortifying u&s;age from this young gentleman, that as he was walking along the road, he met with a &s;howman, who was return|ing from a neighbouring fair with &s;ome wild
<PB N="27" REF="030190_0031_0FE503EF76BB8538">
bea&s;ts in a cart. Among the re&s;t was a mid|dle &s;ized monkey, who was not under cover like the re&s;t, and played &s;o many antic tricks, and made &s;o many grimaces, as engaged all Jack's attention, and delighted him very much, for he always had a propen&s;ity for every &s;pecies of drollery. After a variety of que&s;tions and conver&s;ation, the &s;howman, who probably wanted to be rid of his monkey, propo&s;ed to Jack to purcha&s;e him for half a crown. Jack could not re&s;i&s;t the temptation of being ma&s;ter of &s;uch a droll diverting animal, and therefore agreed to the bargain. But when he was left alone with his purcha&s;e, whom he led along by a chain, he &s;oon began to repent his ha&s;te, and knew not how to di&s;po&s;e of him. As there was however, no remedy, Jack brought him carefully home, and confined him &s;afe in an out-hou&s;e, which was not applied to any u&s;e. In this &s;ituation he kept him &s;everal days, with|out accident, and frequently vi&s;ited him at his lei&s;ure hours, with apples, nuts, and &s;uch other pre&s;ents as he could procure. Among the other tricks which the monkey had been taught to perform, he would ri&s;e upon his hind legs at the word of command, and bow with the great|e&s;t politene&s;s to the company. Jack, who had found out the&s;e accompli&s;hments in his friend, could not re&s;i&s;t the impul&s;e of making them &s;ub&s;ervient to his re&s;entment. He, therefore, one day, procured &s;ome flour, with which he powdered his monkey's head, fixed a large paper bag to his neck, put an old hat under his arm, and tied a large iron &s;kewer to his &s;ide, in&s;tead of a &s;word; and thus accoutred led him about
<PB N="28" REF="030190_0032_0FE50456684599D0">
with infinite &s;atisfaction, calling him Mon&s;ieur, and jabbering &s;uch broken French as he had picked up from the conver&s;ation of the vi&s;itor. It happened very unluckily at this very in&s;tant, that the young gentleman him&s;elf pa&s;&s;ed by, and in&s;tantly &s;aw at one glance the intended copy of him&s;elf, and all the malice of little Jack; who was leading him along, and calling

to him to hold up his head and look like a per|&s;on of fa&s;hion. Rage in&s;tantly took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his mind, and drawing his &s;word, which he happened to have on, he ran the poor monkey through with a &s;udden thru&s;t, and laid him dead upon the ground. What more he might have done is uncertain, for Jack, who was not of a temper to &s;ee calmly &s;uch an outrage com|mitted upon an animal whom he con&s;idered as his friend, flew upon him like a fury, and wre&s;ting the &s;word out of his hand, broke it
<PB N="29" REF="030190_0033_0FE503F2519A60D0">
into twenty pieces. The young gentleman him&s;elf received a fall in the &s;cuffle, which, though it did him no material damage, daubed all his cloaths, and totally &s;poiled the whole

</FIGURE>
arrangement of his dre&s;s. At this in&s;tant, the lady her&s;elf, who had heard the noi&s;e, came down, and the violence of poor Jack was too apparent to be excu&s;ed. Jack, indeed, was &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive to his mi&s;tre&s;s, whom he was very &s;orry to have offended; but, when he was ordered to make conce&s;&s;ions to the young gentleman, as the only conditions upon which he could be kept in the family, he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed. He owned, indeed, that he was much to blame for re&s;enting the provocations he had received, and endeavouring to make his mi&s;tre&s;s's company ridiculous; but as to what he had done in de|fence of his friend the monkey, there were no po&s;&s;ible arguments which could convince him
<PB N="30" REF="030190_0034_0FE504580EE8A680">
he was in the lea&s;t to blame; nor would he have made &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to the king him&s;elf. This unfortunate ob&s;tinacy of Jack's was the occa&s;ion of his being di&s;charged, very much to the regret of the lady her&s;elf, and &s;till more to that of Ma&s;ter Willets. Jack therefore packed up his cloaths in a little bundle, &s;hook all his fellow-&s;ervants by the hand, took an affection|ate leave of his kind ma&s;ter, and once more &s;allied out upon his travels.</P>
<P><FIGURE>

<P>He had not walked far before he came to a town, where a party of &s;oldiers were beating up for volunteers. Jack mingled with the crowd that &s;urrounded the recruiting &s;erjeant, and li&s;tened with great plea&s;ure to the &s;ound of the fifes and drums; nor could he help mecha|nically holding up his head, and &s;tepping for|ward with an air that &s;howed the trade was not entirely new to him. The &s;erjeant &s;oon took
<PB N="31" REF="030190_0035_0FE503F3DC5ECD58">
notice of the&s;e ge&s;tures, and &s;eeing him a &s;trong likely lad, came up to him, clapped him upon the back, and a&s;ked him if he would enli&s;t? "You are a brave boy, &s;aid he, I can &s;ee it in

your looks&mdash;come along with us, and I don't doubt in a few weeks, you'll be as complete a &s;oldier as tho&s;e who have been in the army for years." Jack made no an&s;wer to this, but by in&s;tantly poizing his &s;tick, cocking his hat fiercely, and going through the whole manuel exerci&s;e.&mdash;"Prodigious, indeed, cried the &s;er|jeant, I &s;ee you have been in the army already, and can eat fire as well as any of us. But come with us, my brave lad, you &s;hall live well, have little to do, but now and then fight for your king and country, as every gentleman ought; and in a &s;hort time, I don't doubt but I &s;hall &s;ee you a captain, or &s;ome great man, rolling in wealth, which you have got out of

He is enough to make a whole company de&s;ert."&mdash;"No, &s;aid Jack, they &s;hall never de&s;ert through me; for though I know this, as I am at pre&s;ent out of employment, and have a great re&s;pect for the character of a gentleman &s;oldier, I will enli&s;t directly in your regiment." "A brave fellow, indeed, &s;aid the &s;erjeant; here, my boy, here is your money and your cockade, both which he directly pre&s;ented, for fear his recruit &s;hould change his mind; and thus in a moment little Jack became a &s;oldier.</P>
<P>He had &s;carcely time to feel him&s;elf ea&s;y in his new accoutrements, before he was embark|ed for India in the character of a marine. This kind of life was entirely new to Jack; however, his u&s;ual activity and &s;pirit of ob&s;erva|tion did not de&s;ert him here, and he had not been embarked many weeks, before he was perfectly acquainted with all the duty of a &s;ailor, and in that re&s;pect equal to mo&s;t on board. It happened that the &s;hip, in which he &s;ailed, touched at the Cormo I&s;lands, in order to take in wood and water; the&s;e are &s;ome little i&s;lands near the coa&s;t of Africa, inhabited by blacks. Jack often went on &s;hore with the officers, attending them on their &s;hooting parties to carry their powder and &s;hot, and the game they killed.

All this country con&s;i&s;ts of very lofty hills, co|vered with trees and &s;hrubs of various kinds, which never lo&s;e their leaves, from the perpe|tual warmth of the climate. Through the&s;e it is frequently difficult to force a way, and the hills them&s;elves abound in precipices. It hap|pened that one of the officers whom Jack was attending upon a &s;hooting party, took aim at &s;ome great bird and brought it down; but as it fell into &s;ome deep valley, over &s;ome rocks which it was impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cend, they de&s;pair|ed of gaining their prey. Jack, immediately, with officious ha&s;te, &s;et off and ran down the more level &s;ide of the hill, thinking to make a circuit and reach the valley into which the bird had fallen. He &s;et off, therefore, but as he was totally ignorant of the country, he, in a &s;hort time, buried him&s;elf &s;o deep in the wood, which grew continually thicker, that he knew
<PB N="34" REF="030190_0038_0FE504643189E280">
not which way to proceed. He then thought it mo&s;t prudent to return; but this he found as difficult to effect as the other. He therefore wandered about the woods with inconceivable difficulty all day, but could never find his com|pany nor even reach the &s;hore, or obtain the pro&s;pect of the &s;ea. At length the night ap|proached, and Jack, who perceived it to be impo&s;&s;ible to do that in the dark, which he had not been able to effect in the light, lay down under a rock, and compo&s;ed him&s;elf to re&s;t, as well as he was able. The next day he ro&s;e with the light, and once more attempted to regain the &s;hore: but unfortunately he had totally lo&s;t all idea of the direction he ought to pur&s;ue, and &s;aw nothing around him but the di&s;mal pro&s;pect of woods and hills and preci|pices, without a guide or path. Jack now began to be very hungry, but as he had a fowling piece with him, and powder and &s;hot, he &s;oon
<FIGURE>

<PB N="35" REF="030190_0039_0FE503FDCE284868">
procured him&s;elf a dinner; and kindling a fire with &s;ome dry leaves and &s;ticks, he roa&s;ted his game upon the embers, and dined as com|fortably as he could be expected to do in &s;o forlorn a &s;ituation. Finding him&s;elf much refre&s;hed, he pur&s;ued his journey, but with as little &s;ucce&s;s as ever. On the third day, he indeed came in &s;ight of the &s;ea, but found that he was quite on a different &s;ide of the i&s;land from that where he left the &s;hip, and that neither &s;hip nor boat was to be &s;een. Jack now lo&s;t all hopes of rejoining his comrades, for he knew the &s;hip was to &s;ail at farthe&s;t upon the third day, and would not wait for him. He, therefore, &s;at down very pen&s;ively upon a rock, and ca&s;t his eyes upon the va&s;t extent of ocean which was &s;tretched out before him. He found him&s;elf now abandoned upon a &s;trange country, without a &s;ingle friend, ac|quaintance, or even any one who &s;poke the &s;ame language. He at fir&s;t thought of &s;eeking out the natives, and making known to them his deplorable &s;tate; but he began to fear the reception he might meet with among them. They might not be plea&s;ed, he thought, with his company, and might take the liberty of treating him as the white men generally treat the blacks when they get them into their po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion; that is, make him work hard with very little victuals, and knock him on the head if he attempted to run away. And therefore, &s;ays Jack, as he was meditating all alone, it may, perhaps, be better for me to &s;tay quiet where I am. It is true, indeed, I &s;hall not have much company to talk to, but then I &s;hall
<PB N="36" REF="030190_0040_0FE50465BB9904E0">
have nobody to quarrel with me, or baa, or laugh at my poor daddy and mammy. Nei|ther do I at pre&s;ent &s;ee how I &s;hall get a liveli|hood, when my powder and &s;hot are all expend|ed; but however I &s;hall hardly be &s;tarved, for I &s;aw &s;everal kinds of fruit in the woods, and &s;ome roots which look very much like carrots. As to cloaths, when mine wear out, I &s;hall not much want new ones; for the weather is char|mingly warm; and therefore, all things con&s;i|dered, I don't &s;ee why I &s;hould not be as happy here as in any other place.&mdash;When Jack had fini&s;hed his &s;peech, he &s;et him&s;elf to find a lodg|ing for the night. He had not examined far before he found a dry cavern in a rock, which he thought would prove a very comfortable re&s;idence; he therefore went to work with an hatchet he had with him, and cut &s;ome boughs of trees, which he &s;pread upon the floor, and over tho&s;e a long &s;ilky kind of gra&s;s, which he found in plenty near the place, to make him|&s;elf a bed. His next care was, how to &s;ecure him&s;elf in ca&s;e of any attack, for he did not know whether the i&s;land contained any wild bea&s;ts or not. He therefore cut down &s;everal branches of trees, and wove them into a kind of wicker work, as he had &s;een the men do hurdles when he lived with the farmer; with this contrivance he found he could very &s;ecurely barricade the entrance of his cave. And now, as the evening was again approaching, he began to feel him&s;elf hungry, and &s;eeking along the &s;ea-&s;hore, he found &s;ome &s;hell-fi&s;h, which &s;up|plied him with a plentiful meal. The next day Jack aro&s;e, a little melancholy indeed, but,
<PB N="37" REF="030190_0041_0FE503FF5B19F530">
with a re&s;olution to &s;truggle manfully with the difficulties of his &s;ituation. He walked into the woods and &s;aw &s;everal kinds of fruit and berries, &s;ome of which he ventured to eat, as the birds had pecked them, and found the ta&s;te agreeable. He al&s;o dug up &s;everal &s;pecies of roots, but feared to ta&s;te them le&s;t they &s;hould be poi&s;onous. At length, he &s;elected one that very much re&s;embled a potatoe, and determin|ed to roa&s;t it in the embers, and ta&s;te a very &s;mall bit. It can hardly, thought Jack, do me much hurt, in &s;o very &s;mall a quantity; and if that agrees with me I will increa&s;e the do&s;e. The root was fortunately extremely whole&s;ome and nutritive, &s;o that Jack was in a very &s;hort time tolerably &s;ecure again&s;t the danger of wanting food. In this manner did Jack lead a kind of &s;avage, but tolerably con|tented life, for &s;everal months; during which time he enjoyed perfect health, and was never di&s;covered by any of the natives. He u&s;ed &s;everal times a day to vi&s;it the &s;hore, in hopes that &s;ome &s;hip might pa&s;s that way and deliver him from his &s;olitary impri&s;onment. This, at length, happened, by the boat of an Engli&s;h &s;hip, that was &s;ailing to India, happening to touch upon the coa&s;t; Jack in&s;tantly hailed the crew, and the officer, upon hearing the &s;tory, agreed to receive him; the captain too, when he found that Jack was by no means a con|temptible &s;ailor, very willingly gave him his pa&s;&s;age, and promi&s;ed him a gratuity be&s;ides, if he behaved well.</P>
<P>Jack arrived in India without any accident, and relating his &s;tory, was permitted to &s;erve

in another regiment as his own was no longer there. He &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his courage and good behaviour on &s;everal occa|&s;ions, and before long was advanced to the rank of a &s;erjeant. In this capacity, he was order|ed out upon an expedition into the remote parts of the country. The little army in which he &s;erved now marched on for &s;everal weeks, through a burning climate, and in want of all the nece&s;&s;aries of life. At length, they entered upon &s;ome exten&s;ive plains, which bordered upon the celebrated country of the Tartars. Jack was perfectly well acquainted with the hi&s;tory of this people, and their method of fighting. He knew them to be &s;ome of the be&s;t hor&s;emen in the world indefatigable in their attacks, though often repul&s;ed returning to the charge, and not to be invaded with im|punity; he, therefore, took the liberty of ob|&s;erving
<PB N="39" REF="030190_0043_0FE50400E3B9FB18">
to &s;ome of the officers, that nothing could be more dangerous than their ra&s;hly en|gaging them&s;elves in tho&s;e exten&s;ive plains, where they were every moment expo&s;ed to the attacks of cavalry, without any &s;ucce&s;sful me|thod

of defence, or place of retreat, in ca&s;e of any misfortune. The&s;e remon&s;trances were not much attended to, and after a few hours farther march, they were alarmed by the ap|proach of a con&s;iderable body of Tartar hor&s;e|men. They, however, drew up with all the order they were able, and firing &s;everal &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive vollies, endeavoured to keep the enemy at a di&s;tance. But the Tartars had no de&s;ign of doing that with a con&s;iderable lo&s;s, which they were &s;ure of doing with ea&s;e and &s;afety. In&s;tead therefore of charging the Europeans, they con|tented them&s;elves with giving continual alarms, and menacing them on every &s;ide, without
<PB N="40" REF="030190_0044_0FE50472412EC7B8">
expo&s;ing them&s;elves to any con&s;iderable dan|ger. The army now attempted to retreat, ho|ping that they &s;hould be able to arrive at the neighbouring mountains, where they would be &s;afe from the incur&s;ions of the hor&s;e. But in this attempt they were equally di&s;appointed; for another con&s;iderable body of enemies ap|peared on that &s;ide, and blocked their pa&s;&s;age. The Europeans now found they were &s;urround|ed on all &s;ides, and that re&s;i&s;tance was vain. The commanding officer, therefore, judged it expedient to try what could be effected by ne|gociation, and &s;ent one of his officers, who under&s;tood &s;omething of the Tartar language, to treat with the general of the enemies. The Tartar chief received the Europeans with great civility, and after having gently reproached them with their ambition, in coming &s;o far to invade a people who had never injured them, he con&s;ented upon very moderate conditions to their enlargement: but he in&s;i&s;ted upon having their arms delivered up, except a very few which he permitted them to keep for defence in their return, and upon retaining a certain number of Europeans as ho&s;tages for the performance of the &s;tipulated articles. Among tho&s;e who were thus left with the Tartars, Jack happened to be included, and while all the re&s;t &s;eemed incon|&s;olable at being thus made pri&s;oners by a bar|barous nation, he alone, accu&s;tomed to all the vici&s;&s;itudes of life, retained his cheerfulne&s;s, and prepared to meet every rever&s;e of fortune with his u&s;ual firmne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Tartars, among whom Jack was now to re&s;ide, con&s;titute &s;everal different tribes or
<PB N="41" REF="030190_0045_0FE504039E3450A8">
nations which inhabit an immen&s;e extent of country both in Europe and A&s;ia. Their coun|try is in general open and uncultivated, with out cities or towns, &s;uch as we &s;ee in England. The inhabitants them&s;elves are a bold and hardy race of men that live in &s;mall tents, and change their place of abode with the different &s;ea&s;ons of the year. All their property con&s;i&s;ts in herds of cattle, which they drive along with them from place to place; and upon who&s;e milk and fle&s;h they &s;ub&s;i&s;t. They are particularly fond of hor&s;es, of which they have a &s;mall but ex|cellent breed, hardy and indefatigable for the purpo&s;es of war, and they excel in the manage|ment of them, beyond what is ea&s;y to con|ceive. Immen&s;e herds of the&s;e animals wan|der loo&s;e about the de&s;erts, but marked with the particular mark of the per&s;on or tribe to which they belong. When they want any of the&s;e animals for u&s;e, a certain number of their young men jump upon their hor&s;es with nothing but an halter to guide them, each carrying in his hand a pole with a noo&s;e or cord at the end. When they come in &s;ight of the herd, they pur&s;ue the hor&s;e they wi&s;h to take at full &s;peed, come up with him in &s;pite of his &s;wift|ne&s;s, and never fail to throw the noo&s;e about his neck as he runs. They are frequently known to jump upon young hor&s;es that have pa&s;&s;ed their whole life in the de&s;ert, and with only a girt around the animal's body to hold by, maintain their &s;eat, in &s;pite of all his vio|lent exertions, until they have wearied him out and reduced him into perfect obedience. Such was the nation with whom the lot of Jack
<PB N="42" REF="030190_0046_0FE504740D42D620">
was now to re&s;ide, nor was he long before he had an opportunity of &s;howing his talents.</P>
<P>It happened that a favourite hor&s;e of the chief was taken with a violent fever, and &s;eem|ed to be in immediate danger of death. The khan, for &s;o he is called among the Tartars, &s;eeing his hor&s;e grow hourly wor&s;e, at length applied to the Europeans, to know if they could &s;ugge&s;t any thing for his recovery. All the officers were profoundly ignorant of far|riery; but when the application was made to Jack, he de&s;ired to &s;ee the hor&s;e, and with great gravity began to feel his pul&s;e, by pa&s;&s;ing his hand within the animal's fore-leg; which gave the Tartars a very high idea of his ingenuity. Finding that the animal was in a high fever, he propo&s;ed to the khan to let him blood, which he had learned to do very dexterou&s;ly in England. He obtained permi&s;&s;ion to do as he plea&s;ed, and having by great good luck a lancet
<FIGURE>

<PB N="43" REF="030190_0047_0FE5040E1B749080">
with him, he let him blood very dexterou&s;ly in the neck. After this operation he covered him up, and gave him a warm potion made out of &s;uch ingredients as he could procure upon the &s;pot, and left him quiet. In a few hours the hor&s;e began to mend, and, to the great joy of the khan, perfectly recovered in a few days. This cure, &s;o opportunely perfor|med, rai&s;ed the reputation of Jack &s;o high, that every body came to con&s;ult him about their hor&s;es, and in a &s;hort time he was the univer&s;al farrier of the tribe. The khan him|&s;elf conceived &s;o great an affection for him, that he gave him an excellent hor&s;e to ride upon and attend him in his hunting parties; and Jack, who excelled in the art of hor&s;eman&s;hip, managed him &s;o well as to gain the e&s;teem of the whole nation.</P>
<P><FIGURE>

<P><PB N="44" REF="030190_0048_0FE50475D0F92B48">
The Tartars, though they are excellent hor&s;emen, have no idea of managing their hor&s;es, unle&s;s by violence; but Jack in a &s;hort time, by continual care and attention, made his hor&s;e &s;o docile and obedient to every mo|tion of his hand and leg, that the Tartars them&s;elves would gaze upon him with admi|ration, and allow them&s;elves to be out-done. Not contented with this, he procured &s;ome iron, and made his hor&s;e-&s;hoes in the Euro|pean ta&s;te; this al&s;o was matter of a&s;toni&s;hment to all the Tartars, who are accu&s;tomed to ride their hor&s;es un&s;hod. He next ob&s;erved that the Tartar &s;addles are all prodigiou&s;ly large and cumber&s;ome, rai&s;ing the hor&s;emen up to a great di&s;tance from the back of his hor&s;e. Jack &s;et him&s;elf to work, and was not long before he had completed &s;omething like an Engli&s;h hunt|ing &s;addle, on which he paraded before the khan. All mankind &s;eem to have a pa&s;&s;ion for novelty, and the khan was &s;o delighted with this effort of Jack's ingenuity, that, after paying him the highe&s;t compliments, he intimated a de&s;ire of having &s;uch a &s;addle for him&s;elf. Jack was the mo&s;t obliging creature in the world, and &s;pared no labour to &s;erve his friends; he went to work again, and in a &s;hort time com|pleted a &s;addle &s;till more elegant for the khan. The&s;e exertions gained him the favour and e&s;teem both of the khan and all the tribe; &s;o that Jack was an univer&s;al favourite and loaded with pre&s;ents, while all the re&s;t of the officers, who had never learned to make a &s;addle or an hor&s;e-&s;hoe, were treated with contempt and indifference. Jack, indeed, behaved with the
<PB N="45" REF="030190_0049_0FE50410219CFEE8">
greate&s;t genero&s;ity to his countrymen, and divid|ed with them all the mutton and veni&s;on which were given him; but he could not help &s;ome|times ob&s;erving, that it was great pity they had not learned to make an hor&s;e-&s;hoe in&s;tead of dancing and dre&s;&s;ing hair.</P>
<P>And now an amba&s;&s;ador arrived from the Engli&s;h &s;ettlements, with an account that all the conditions of the treaty had been perform|ed, and demanding the re&s;titution of the pri|&s;oners. The Tartar chief was too much a man of honour to delay an in&s;tant, and they were all re&s;tored; but before they &s;et out, Jack laboured with indefatigable zeal to fini&s;h a cou|ple of &s;addles and a dozen hor&s;e-&s;hoes, which he pre&s;ented to the khan, with many expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude. The khan was charmed with this proof of his affection, and in return made him a pre&s;ent of a couple of fine hor&s;es, and &s;eve|ral valuable &s;kins of bea&s;ts. Jack arrived without any accident at the Engli&s;h &s;ettlements, and &s;elling his &s;kins and hor&s;es, found him&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a moderate &s;um of money. He now began to have a de&s;ire to return to Eng|land, and one of the officers, who had often been obliged to him during his captivity, pro|cured him a di&s;charge. He embarked, there|fore, with all his property, on board a &s;hip, which was returning home, and in a few months was &s;afely landed at Plymouth.</P>
<P>But Jack was too active and too prudent to give him&s;elf up to idlene&s;s. After con&s;idering various &s;chemes of bu&s;ine&s;s, he determined to take up his old trade of forging; and for that purpo&s;e made a journey into the North, and
<FIGURE>
<PB N="46" REF="030190_0050_0FE504E2EEB951A8">

found his old ma&s;ter alive, and as active as ever. His ma&s;ter, who had always entertained an e&s;teem for Jack, welcomed him with great affection, and being in want of a foreman, he engaged him at a very hand&s;ome price, for that place. Jack was now indefatigable in the execution of his new office; inflexibly hone&s;t where the intere&s;ts of his ma&s;ter were concern|ed, and at the &s;ame time humane and oblig|ing to the men who were under him, he gain|ed the affection of all about him. In a few years, his ma&s;ter was &s;o thoroughly convinced of his merit, that growing old him&s;elf, he took Jack into partner&s;hip, and committed the management of the whole bu&s;ine&s;s to his care. He continued to exert the &s;ame qualities now which he had done before, by which means he improved the bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o much, as to gain a con&s;iderable fortune, and become one of the

<HEAD>THE LITTLE QUEEN.</HEAD>
<P>THERE reigned once upon a time, in a di&s;tant i&s;land, a good prince who was pa&s;|&s;ionately beloved by all his &s;ubjects. It could not happen otherwi&s;e, for he was their common father. He provided for all their rea&s;onable wants, he rewarded tho&s;e who de&s;erved well of their country, and he let none of the wicked, nor even of the idle, e&s;cape without puni&s;h|ment. This amiable monarch had but one cau&s;e of anxiety; Myra, his only child, by no means requited the attention which had been given to her education. At twelve years of age &s;he was &s;hamefully ignorant. Her thought|le&s;&s;ne&s;s made her forget every le&s;&s;on which &s;he had been taught, and her pre&s;umption kept pace with her want of knowledge; of con&s;e|quence as &s;he thought her&s;elf perfectly accom|pli&s;hed, &s;he de&s;pi&s;ed all in&s;truction. One day

He is a man for whom I have a high e&s;teem, and with rea&s;on, as he is di&s;creet, hone&s;t, and humane.

<P>This direction no way &s;uited the ta&s;te of our young Queen, who wi&s;hed to have given that important charge to one of her favourites, Philintus, a tall, genteel lad, not indeed many years older than her&s;elf, but one who, to to|lerable &s;kill in dancing and &s;inging, added the very agreeable talent of elegant flattery. He was him&s;elf as aver&s;e to &s;tudy, and of con&s;e|quence as ignorant as his royal mi&s;tre&s;s; but he had knowledge enough of his own intere&s;t to excite him never to omit a&s;&s;uring her that every one looked on her as a model of a per|fect prince&s;s, although he was con&s;cious that,

out of her hearing, &s;he was univer&s;ally blamed for being &s;o totally unlike her excellent father, and for &s;pending her whole time in trifling amu&s;ements.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the little &s;overeign reached her i&s;land, &s;he beheld with plea&s;ure troops of &s;hep|herds and &s;hepherde&s;&s;es, in elegant fancy dre&s;|&s;es of ro&s;e colour and white, who &s;ung carols in prai&s;e of their new Queen, &s;trewed &s;weet &s;cented flowers in her path, and pre&s;ented her with odoriferous no&s;egays. Myra, charmed with this &s;pecimen of her &s;ubjects gallantry, ordered money to be di&s;tributed among&s;t them; and, under the conduct of Ari&s;tus, repaired to a lovely, though &s;mall palace, fitted up for her reception. Fatigued with the voyage, the Queen and her young court ha&s;tened to their repo&s;e; but her Maje&s;ty forgot not to order, for the next day, a comedy to be acted, followed by a ball and a &s;plendid entertainment. On the next morn, Myra and her court amu&s;ed them&s;elves by walking into the capital town, which lay not far from the palace. "Ob&s;erve," &s;aid Ari&s;tus to his &s;overeign, <Q>the air of con|tent which reigns in every face we meet.</Q> "That," &s;aid Philintus, <Q>we &s;hould attri|bute to the pre&s;ence of our lovely Queen.</Q> "Without doubt," replied Ari&s;tus, <Q>they are &s;en&s;ible of that honour; but I ought to in|form you, that their gaiety is chiefly owing to their being con&s;cious of the excellent go|vernment under which they live, and of the wi&s;dom of tho&s;e laws by which their King, whom they look upon as their father, go|verns the country.</Q> "Let us now," &s;aid

&s;aid the young Queen with an air of dignity. <Q>Po&s;&s;ibly, &s;aid Ari&s;tus, your Maje&s;ty may &s;ee cau&s;e hereafter to repent of this ha&s;ty command.</Q> <Q>Neverthele&s;s, repeated Myra, it <HI>&s;hall</HI> be executed.</Q> Ari&s;tus retired with a &s;igh, and Philintus loudly applauded the ming|led humanity and firmne&s;s of his infant &s;ove|reign.

<P>Unluckily among the ladies of the bedcham|ber were two, who, not having reached their eleventh year, had been u&s;ed to eat little or no &s;uppers, to take moderate exerci&s;e, and to go to bed early.

In con&s;equence, they were both extremely ill the next morning.

On this the go|verne&s;&s;es were obliged to have recour&s;e to the royal authority, and the Queen having com|manded the young ladies to &s;ubmit to di&s;ci|pline, they took what was ordered and all went right again.</P>

One day that the young Queen was walking in the garden of her palace, &s;he was di&s;gu&s;ted at the deva&s;tation which had been made by ca|terpillars on the leaves of the trees. <Q>What vile creatures are the&s;e!</Q> &s;aid &s;he to Philin|tus: <Q>Did you ever &s;ee &s;uch a piece of work as they have made here?</Q> <Q>I think, re|plied the courtier, that it would be a good deed to root them out of the i&s;land, and to proclaim rewards for tho&s;e who would un|dertake to de&s;troy them.</Q> <Q>What &s;ay you to that, Ari&s;tus, &s;aid Myra, can my &s;ub|jects exi&s;t without caterpillars?</Q> <Q>Your Maje&s;ty, replied Ari&s;tus, has not forgot the bees, I find, but here the ca&s;e is widely different. The caterpillars which have &s;tript tho&s;e trees do much mi&s;chief, and are of no one u&s;e to &s;ociety.</Q> <Q>I am heartily glad, &s;aid the Queen, that we coincide in opinion, for I am determined to have all the cater|pillars in my dominions de&s;troyed; I hate them, na&s;ty creatures!</Q> <Q>Your Maje&s;ty &s;aid Ari&s;tus, certainly means to except from this general ma&s;&s;acre, that kind of caterpil|lar which produces the &s;ilk-worm.</Q> <Q>Do but hear him,</Q> &s;aid Philintus, in the Queen's ear; <Q>that fellow makes a point of contradict|ing your Maje&s;ty in every thing.</Q> <Q>Let every caterpillar in my realm be put to death,</Q> ex|claimed the piqued &s;overeign.</P>
<P><Q>I am tired to death,</Q> &s;aid Myra, one day,<Q> of this eternal verdure. The&s;e walks of turf, and the&s;e clumps of laurel, though I like them well enough on the whole, yet being repeated &s;o often, they fatigue my eyes;&mdash;

green, and green, and nothing but green&mdash;Why can I not have a ro&s;e-colour bower?</Q> Philintus now turned all his thoughts towards the accompli&s;hment of his &s;overeign's rational wi&s;h. He had ob&s;erved in a di&s;tant part of the garden an arbour where a honey&s;uckle over&s;pread the green frame work. He ordered the leaves to be &s;tripped off, the wood to be painted ro&s;e colour, and he covered the whole with artificial ro&s;es hanging by crim&s;on rib-bands. The Queen was enchanted with this gaudy retreat, and as &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw it, ordered her dinner to be &s;et out upon that very &s;pot. The &s;un &s;hone out with great power, and &s;carce had the company &s;ate ten minutes at their meal, before &s;ome complained of aching heads, &s;ome of dazzled eyes; all lo&s;t their appetites, and the whole was a confu&s;ion of heat and glare. Ari&s;tus advi&s;ed the whole party to abandon the flaring &s;cene, and to refre&s;h their eyes by gazing on the turf in &s;ome &s;hady place. They did &s;o, and all went well again. In con&s;e|quence, it was &s;ettled by her Maje&s;ty in coun|cil, that, during the &s;ummer, it were better for the leaves of the trees to be green, than to be ro&s;e colour.</P>
<P>Myra was &s;o enchanted with the plea&s;ures of her palace, that &s;he gave her&s;elf little trouble as to what pa&s;&s;ed in the i&s;land at large. Her whole time was employed in &s;chemes for in|crea&s;ing and varying her amu&s;ements: &s;ome|times, indeed, &s;he walked into the country: but her pre&s;ence no longer appeared to give any plea&s;ure to her &s;ubjects&mdash;there were no more &s;ongs in her prai&s;e&mdash;no more cries of

The plan was, that all the court &s;hould appear in pa&s;toral dre&s;&s;es, and that the company &s;hould dance on one of tho&s;e elegant lawns with which the palace garden abounded. Myra approved of this plan, only de&s;iring that the habits might be as elegant as the plan would allow. <Q>They can only be made of linen, madam,</Q> &s;aid one of the bedchamber-women.

<P><Q>Aye! why, what have tho&s;e na&s;ty vermin to do with the manufacture of &s;ilk?</Q></P>
<P><Q>There is one &s;pecies of tho&s;e caterpillars which produces the materials, without which &s;ilk cannot be made; and as the &s;ellers of &s;ilk in the towns are in general connected, by marriage or relation&s;hip, with the breed|ers of the &s;ilk-worms, they have determined all together to quit a country where they are deprived of the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting.</Q></P>
<P>That very evening the Queen ob&s;erved with a &s;urpri&s;e, which almo&s;t equalled horror, that the apartments of the palace were lighted with tallow candles.

they are on the point of quitting a place, where they cannot earn their bread. Alas! added he, were your Maje&s;ty to make, at this time, the tour of your dominions, you would find the face of the whole country de|plorably altered.</Q> Philinus would have turned this account into ridicule, but Myra, by a look, &s;topped his buffoonery, and retired to her chamber with a heavy heart.</P>
<P>The next morning &s;he took Ari&s;tus with her, and drove into the environs of her capital. <Q>You were too much in the right, &s;he &s;aid, when you bade me expect a deplorable alter|ation among my people.

<P>The Queen, having given &s;ome relief to the&s;e wretched objects, proceeded to a&s;k Ari&s;|tus, what was become of the crowds of bu&s;y people who were u&s;ed to throng in the &s;treets of the capital? "for," &s;aid &s;he, <Q>half the hou&s;es &s;eem to be &s;hut up, and the whole town ap|pears de&s;erted, in compari&s;on of its &s;tate when I fir&s;t &s;aw it.</Q> The mini&s;ter told her,
<Q><PB N="59" REF="030190_0063_0FE5049352CBA540">
that there was a mutual dependence of one trade upon another, and that, in con&s;equence of the departure of the &s;ilk and wax mer|chants and manufacturers, tho&s;e who were u&s;ed to &s;upply that large body of men with cloaths, &s;hoes and &s;tockings, provi&s;ions, and every other accommodation, having now no market for their goods, had &s;hut up their &s;hops, and were preparing, one and all, for their departure. He added, that it was much to be feared, that the farmers, who u&s;ed to bring to the town corn, hay, butter, eggs, poultry, &amp;c. together with their fami|lies, labourers, &amp;c. would &s;oon follow this example.</Q></P>
<P>Struck with this painful detail, the young Queen, who&s;e goodne&s;s of heart was equal to the thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s of her head, exclaimed in an agony of di&s;tre&s;s, <Q>Oh heavens! why did I leave my father's court? why take upon me a ta&s;k of which I was &s;o incapable?

Her orders were in|&s;tantly obeyed, and &s;he with her whole court, took leave of the Fortunate I&s;land, and &s;oon reached the port they wi&s;hed for. As &s;oon as Myra &s;aw the King, &s;he threw her&s;elf at his feet, bathed in tears. <Q>How is this, &s;aid he, my daughter, are you returned already? are you &s;o &s;oon weary of &s;overeign power?</Q> <Q>Alas!

<HEAD>The NATURAL HISTORY of the BEE.</HEAD>
<P>TO give a complete hi&s;tory of this in&s;ect in a few pages, which &s;ome have exhau&s;t|ed volumes in de&s;cribing, and who&s;e nature and properties &s;till continue in di&s;pute, is impo&s;&s;i|ble. It will be &s;ufficient to give a general idea of the animal's operations; which, though they have been &s;tudied for more than two thou&s;and years, are &s;till but incompletely known. The account given us by Reaumur is &s;ufficiently minute; and, if true, &s;ufficient|ly wonderful: but I find many of the facts which he relates, doubted by tho&s;e who are mo&s;t conver&s;ant with bees; and &s;ome of them actually declared not to have a real exi&s;tence in nature.</P>
<P>It is unhappy, therefore, for tho&s;e who&s;e me|thod demands an hi&s;tory of bees, that they are unfurni&s;hed with tho&s;e materials which have
<PB N="62" REF="030190_0066_0FE5051F5B387D98">
induced &s;o many ob&s;ervers to contradict &s;o great a naturali&s;t. His life was &s;pent in the contemplation; and it requires an equal &s;hare of attention to prove the error of his di&s;cove|ries. Without entering, therefore, into the di&s;pute, I will take him for my guide; and ju&s;t mention, as I go along, tho&s;e particulars in which &s;ucceeding ob&s;ervers have begun to think him erroneous. Which of the two are right, time only can di&s;cover; for my part I have only heard one &s;ide, for as yet none have been &s;o bold as openly to oppo&s;e Reaumur's delightful re&s;earches.</P>
<P>There are three different kinds of bees in every hive. Fir&s;t, the labouring bees, which make up the far greate&s;t number, and are thought to be neither male or female, but mere|ly born for the purpo&s;es of labour, and continu|ing the breed, by &s;upplying the young with provi&s;ion, while yet in their helple&s;s &s;tate. The &s;econd &s;ort are the drones; they are of a darker colour, longer, and more thick by one third than the former: they are &s;uppo&s;ed to be the males; and there is not above a hundred of them, in a hive of &s;even or eight thou&s;and bees. The third &s;ort is much larger than either of the former, and &s;till fewer in number: &s;ome a&s;&s;ert, that there is not above one in every &s;warm; but this later ob&s;ervers affirm not to be true, there being &s;ometimes five or &s;ix in the &s;ame hive. The&s;e are called queen-bees, and are &s;aid to lay all the eggs from which the whole &s;warm is hatched in a &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>In examining the &s;tructure of the common working bee, the fir&s;t remarkable part that of|fers
<PB N="63" REF="030190_0067_0FE504967458ECB8">
is the trunk, which &s;erves to extract the honey from flowers. It is not formed, like that of the other flies, in the manner of a tube, by which the fluid is to be &s;ucked up; but like a be&s;om, to &s;weep, or a tongue, to lick it a|way. The animal is furni&s;hed al&s;o with teeth, which &s;erve it in making wax. This &s;ub&s;tance is gathered from flowers, like honey; it con|&s;i&s;ts of that du&s;t or farina which contributes to the fecundation of plants, and is moulded into wax by the little animal, at lei&s;ure. Every bee, when it leaves the hive to collect this precious &s;tore, enters into the cup of the flower, parti|cularly &s;uch as &s;eem charged with the greate&s;t quantities of this yellow farina. As the ani|mal's body is covered over with hair, it rolls it&s;elf within the flower, and &s;oon becomes quite covered with the du&s;t, which it &s;oon after bru&s;hes off with its own hind legs, and kneads into two little balls. In the thighs of the hind legs there are to cavities, edged with hair; and into the&s;e, as into a ba&s;ket, the animal &s;ticks its pellets. Thus employed, the bee flies from flower to flower, encrea&s;ing its &s;tore, and adding to its &s;tock of wax; until the ball, upon each thigh, becomes as big as a grain of pepper: by this time, having got a &s;ufficient load, it returns, the be&s;t of its way to the hive.</P>
<P>The belly of the bee is divided into &s;ix rings, which &s;ometimes &s;horten the body, by &s;lipping one over the other. It contains within it, be|&s;ide the inte&s;tines, the honey-bag, the venom-bag, and the &s;ting. The honey-bag is as tran&s;|parent as cry&s;tal, containing the honey that

the bee has bru&s;hed from the flowers; of which the greater part is carried to the hive, and poured into the cells of the honey-comb; while the remainder &s;erves for the bee's own nouri&s;hment: for, during &s;ummer, it never touches what has been laid up for the winter. The &s;ting, which &s;erves to defend this little ani|mal from its enemies, is compo&s;ed of three parts; the &s;heath, and two darts, which are extremely &s;mall and penetrating. Both the darts have &s;everal &s;mall points or barbs, like tho&s;e of a fi&s;h-hook, which render the &s;ting more painful, and make the darts rankle in the wound. Still, however, this in&s;trument would be very &s;light, did not the bee poi&s;on the wound. The &s;heath, which has a &s;harp point, makes the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion; which is fol|lowed by that of the darts, and then the vene|mous liquor is poured in. The &s;heath &s;ome|times &s;ticks &s;o fa&s;t in the wound, that the ani|mal is obliged to leave it behind; by which the bee &s;oon after dies, and the wound is con|&s;iderably enflamed. It might at fir&s;t appear well for mankind, if the bee were without its &s;ting: but, upon recollection, it will be found, that the little animal would then have too ma|ny rivals in &s;haring its labours. An hundred other lazy animals, fond of honey, and hating labour, would intrude upon the &s;weets of the hive; and the trea&s;ure would be carried off, for want of armed guardians to protect it.</P>
<P>From examining the bee &s;ingly, we now come to con&s;ider it in &s;ociety, as an animal not only &s;ubject to laws, but active, vigilant, la|borious, and di&s;intere&s;ted. All its provi&s;ions
<PB N="65" REF="030190_0069_0FE504A480ACCE48">
are laid up for the community; and all its arts in building a cell, de&s;igned for the benefit of po&s;terity. The &s;ub&s;tance with which bees build their cells is wax: which is fa&s;hioned into con|venient apartments for them&s;elves and their young. When they begin to work in their hives, they divide them&s;elves into four com|panies: one of which roves in the fields in &s;earch of materials; another employs it&s;elf in laying out the bottom and partitions of their cells; a third is employed in making the in&s;ide &s;mooth from the corners and angles; and the fourth company bring food for the re&s;t, or re|lieve tho&s;e who return with their re&s;pective bur|thens. But they are not kept con&s;tant to one employment; they often change the ta&s;ks a&s;|&s;igned them: tho&s;e that have been at work, being permitted to go abroad; and tho&s;e that have been in the fields already, take their places. They &s;eem even to have &s;igns, by which they under&s;tand each other; for when any of them want food, it bends down its trunk to the bee from whom it is expected, which then opens its honey-bag, and lets &s;ome drops fall into the other's mouth, which is at that time opened to receive it. Their diligence and labour is &s;o great, that, in a day's time, they are able to make cells, which lie upon each other, numerous enough to contain three thou&s;and bees.</P>
<P>If we examine their cells, they will be found formed in the exacte&s;t proportion. It was &s;aid by Pappus, an ancient geometrician, that, of all other figures, hexagons were the mo&s;t con|venient;
<PB N="66" REF="030190_0070_0FE50522A9375888">
for, when placed touching each other the mo&s;t convenient room would be given, and the &s;malle&s;t lo&s;t. The cells of the bees are perfect hexagons: the&s;e, in every honey-comb, are double, opening on either &s;ide, and clo&s;ed at the bottom. The bottoms are compo&s;ed of little triangular panes, which, when united together, terminate in a point, and lie exactly upon the extremities of other panes of the &s;ame &s;hape, in oppo&s;ite cells. The&s;e lodgings have &s;paces, like &s;treets, between them, large enough to give the bees a free pa&s;&s;age in and out; and yet narrow enough to pre&s;erve the nece&s;&s;ary heat. The mouth of every cell is defended by a border, which makes the door a little le&s;s than the in&s;ide of the cell, which &s;erves to &s;trengthen the whole. The&s;e cells &s;erve for different purpo&s;es: for laying up their young; for their wax, which in winter becomes a part of their food; and for their honey, which makes their principal &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>It is well known that the habitation of bees ought to be very clo&s;e; and what their hives want, from the negligence and un&s;kilfulne&s;s of man, the&s;e animals &s;upply by their own in|du&s;try: &s;o that it is their principal care, when fir&s;t hived, to &s;top up all the crannies. For this purpo&s;e they make u&s;e of a re&s;inous gum, which is more tenacious than wax, and differs greatly from it. This the ancients called Pro|polis: it will grow con&s;iderably hard in June; though it will in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;often by heat; and is often found different in con&s;i&s;tence, co|lour and &s;mell. It has generally an agreeable aromatic odour when it is warmed; and by
<PB N="67" REF="030190_0071_0FE504A60CE08A10">
&s;ome it is con&s;idered as a mo&s;t grateful perfume. When the bees begin to work with it, it is &s;oft, but it acquires a firmer con&s;i&s;tence every day; till at length it a&s;&s;umes a brown colour, and becomes much harder than wax. The bees car|ry it on their hinder legs; and &s;ome think it is met with on the birch, the willow, and pop|lar. However it is procured, it is certain that they plai&s;ter the in&s;ide of their hives with this compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>If examined through a gla&s;s hive, from the hurry the whole &s;warm is in, the whole at fir&s;t appears like anarchy and confu&s;ion; but the &s;pectator &s;oon finds every animal diligently employed, and following one pur&s;uit, with a &s;ettled purpo&s;e. Their teeth are the in&s;tru|ments by which they model and fa&s;hion their various buildings, and give them &s;uch &s;ymme|try and perfection. They begin at the top of the hive; and &s;everal of them work at a time, at the cells which have two faces. If they are &s;tinted with regard to time, they give the new cells but half the depth which they ought to have; leaving them imperfect, till they have &s;ketched out the number of cells nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. The con&s;truction of their combs, co&s;ts them a great deal of labour: they are made by in&s;en&s;ible additions; and not ca&s;t at once in a mold, as &s;ome are apt to imagine. There &s;eems no end of their &s;haping, fini&s;hing, and turning them neatly up. The cells for their young are mo&s;t carefully formed; tho&s;e de&s;igned for lodging the drones, are larger than the re&s;t; and that for the queen-bee, the lar|ge&s;t of all. The cells in which the young
<PB N="68" REF="030190_0072_0FE5052430E59FB8">
brood are lodged, &s;erve at different times for containing honey; and this proceeds from an obvious cau&s;e: every worm, before it is trans|formed into an aurelia, hangs its old &s;kin on the partitions of its cell; and thus, while it &s;trengthens the wall, dimini&s;hes the capacity of its late apartment. The &s;ame cell, in a &s;ingle &s;ummer, is often tenanted by three or four worms in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and the next &s;ea&s;on, by three or four more. Each worm takes particu|lar care to fortify the pannels of its cell, by hanging up its &s;poils there: thus, the partitions being lined, &s;ix or eight deep, become at la&s;t too narrow for a new brood, and are converted into &s;tore-hou&s;es, for honey.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e cells where nothing but honey is de|po&s;ited, are much deeper than the re&s;t. When the harve&s;t of honey is &s;o plentiful that they have not &s;ufficient room for it, they either lengthen their combs, or build more; which are much longer than the former. Sometimes they work at three combs at a time; for, when there are three work-hou&s;es, more bees may be thus employed, without embarra&s;&s;ment.</P>
<P>But honey, as was before ob&s;erved, is not the only food upon which the&s;e animals &s;ub&s;i&s;t. The meal of flowers, of which their wax is formed, is one of their mo&s;t favourite repa&s;ts. This is a diet which they live upon during the &s;ummer; and of which they lay up a large win|ter provi&s;ion. The wax of which their combs are made, is no more than this meal dige&s;ted, and wrought into a pa&s;te. When the flowers upon which bees generally feed, are not fully blown, and this meal or du&s;t is not offered in
<PB N="69" REF="030190_0073_0FE504A7E696CCA8">
&s;ufficient quantities, the bees pinch the tops of the &s;tamina in which it is contained, with their teeth; and thus anticipate the progre&s;s of vegetation. In April and May, the bees are bu&s;y, from morning to evening, in gathering this meal; but when the weather becomes too hot in the mid&s;t of &s;ummer, they work only in the morning.</P>
<P>The bee is furni&s;hed with a &s;tomach for its wax, as well as its honey. In the former of the two, their powder is altered, dige&s;ted and concocted into real wax; and is thus ejected by the &s;ame pa&s;&s;age by which it was &s;wallowed. Every comb, newly made, is white: but it be|comes yellow as it grows old, and almo&s;t black when kept too long in the hive. Be&s;ide the wax thus dige&s;ted, there is a large portion of the powder kneaded up for food in every hive, and kept in &s;eparate cells, for winter provi|&s;ion. This is called, by the country people, bee-bread; and contributes to the health and &s;trength of the animal during winter. Tho&s;e who rear bees, may rob them of their honey, and feed them, during the winter, with treacle; but no proper &s;ub&s;titute has yet been found for the bee-bread; and, without it, the ani|mals become con&s;umptive and die.</P>
<P>As for the honey, it is extracted from that part of the flower called the nectareum. From the mouth this delicious fluid pa&s;&s;es into the gullet: and then into the fir&s;t &s;tomach, or ho|ney-bag, which, when filled, appears like an oblong bladder. Children, that live in coun|try places, are well acquainted with this blad|der; and de&s;troy many bees to come at their
<PB N="70" REF="030190_0074_0FE5052BD8EC37F0">
&s;tore of honey. When a bee has &s;ufficiently filled its fir&s;t &s;tomach, it returns back to the hive, where it di&s;gorges the honey into one of the cells. It often happens that the bee deli|vers its &s;tore to &s;ome other, at the mouth of the hive, and flies off for a fre&s;h &s;upply. Some honey-combs are always left open for common u&s;e; but many others are &s;topped up, till there is a nece&s;&s;ity of opening them. Each of the&s;e are covered carefully with wax; &s;o clo&s;e, that the covers &s;eem to be made at the very in&s;tant the fluid is depo&s;ited within them.</P>
<P>Having thus given a cur&s;ory de&s;cription of the in&s;ect, individually con&s;idered, and of the habitation it forms, we next come to its &s;ocial habits and in&s;titutions: and, in con&s;idering this little animal attentively, after the nece&s;&s;ary precautions for the immediate pre&s;ervation of the community, its &s;econd care is turned to the continuance of po&s;terity. How numerous &s;o|ever the multitude of bees may appear in one &s;warm, yet they all owe their original to a &s;in|gle parent, which is called the queen-bee. It is indeed &s;urpri&s;ing that a &s;ingle in&s;ect &s;hall, in one &s;ummer, give birth to above twenty thou|&s;and young: but, upon opening her body, the wonder will cea&s;e; as the number of eggs ap|pearing, at one time, amounts to five thou&s;and. This animal, who&s;e exi&s;tence is of &s;uch impor|tance to her &s;ubjects, may ea&s;ily be di&s;tingui&s;h|ed from the re&s;t, by her &s;ize, and the &s;hape of her body. On her &s;afety depends the whole welfare of the commonwealth; and the atten|tions paid her by all the re&s;t of the &s;warm, evi|dently &s;how the dependence her &s;ubjects have
<PB N="71" REF="030190_0075_0FE504ABD8A9E378">
upon her &s;ecurity. If this in&s;ect be carefully ob&s;erved, &s;he will be &s;een at times attended with a numerous retinue, marching from cell to cell, plunging the extremity of her body into many of them, and leaving a &s;mall egg in each. When the queen-bee has depo&s;ited the number of eggs nece&s;&s;ary in the cells, the working bees undertake the care of the ri&s;ing po&s;terity. They are &s;een to leave off their u&s;ual employments; to con&s;truct proper receptacles for eggs; or to complete tho&s;e that are already formed. They purpo&s;ely build little cells, extremely &s;olid, for the young; in which they employ a great deal of wax: tho&s;e de&s;igned for lodging the males, as was already ob&s;erved, are larger than the re&s;t; and tho&s;e for the queen-bees the lar|ge&s;t of all. There is u&s;ually but one egg de|po&s;ited in every cell. A day or two after it is depo&s;ited, the worm is excluded from the &s;hell of the egg, having the appearance of a maggot rolled up in a ring, and lying &s;oftly on a bed of a whiti&s;h coloured jelly; upon which al&s;o the little animal begins to feed. In the mean time, the in&s;tant it appears, the working bees attend it with the mo&s;t anxious and parental tenderne&s;s; they furni&s;h it every hour with a &s;upply of this whiti&s;h &s;ub&s;tance, on which it feeds and lies; and watch the cell with unre|mitting care. They are nur&s;es that have a greater affection for the offspring of others, than many parents have for their own children. They are con&s;tant in vi&s;iting each cell, and &s;ee|ing that nothing is wanting; preparing the white mixture, which is nothing but a compo|&s;ition
<PB N="72" REF="030190_0076_0FE5055A9585B848">
of honey and wax, in their own bowels, with which they feed them. Thus attended, and plentifully fed, the worm, in le&s;s than &s;ix days time, comes to its full growth, and no longer accepts the food offered it. When the bees perceive that it has no further occa&s;ion for feeding, they perform the la&s;t offices of tend|erne&s;s, and &s;hut the little animal up in its cell; walling up the mouth of its apartment with wax: there they leave the worm to it&s;elf; hav|ing &s;ecured it from every external injury.</P>
<P>The worm is no &s;ooner left enclo&s;ed, but, from a &s;tate of inaction, it begins to labour, ex|tending and &s;hortening its body; and by this means lining the walls of its apartment with a &s;ilken tape&s;try, which it &s;pins in the manner of caterpillars, before they undergo their la&s;t transformation. When their cell is thus pre|pared, the animal is &s;oon after transformed in|to an aurelia; but differing from that of the common caterpillar, as it exhibits not only the legs, but the wings of the future bee, in its pre&s;ent &s;tate of inactivity. Thus, in about twenty, or one and twenty days after the egg was laid, the bee is completely formed, and fitted to undergo the fatigues of its &s;tate. When all its parts have acquired their proper &s;trength and con&s;i&s;tence, the young animal opens its pri&s;on, by piercing with its teeth the waxen door that confines it. When ju&s;t freed from its cell, it is as yet moi&s;t, and incommoded with the &s;poils of its former &s;ituation; but the officious bees are &s;oon &s;een to flock round it, and to lick it clean on all &s;ides with their trunks; while another band, with equal a&s;&s;iduity, are
<PB N="73" REF="030190_0077_0FE504B7C1BBD900">
ob&s;erved to feed it with honey: others again begin immediately to clean&s;e the cell that has been ju&s;t left; to carry the ordures out of the hive, and to fit the place for a new inhabitant. The young bee &s;oon repays their care, by its indu&s;try; for as &s;oon as ever its external parts become dry, it di&s;covers its natural appetites for labour, and indu&s;triou&s;ly begins the ta&s;k, which it pur&s;ues unremittingly through life. The toil of man is irk&s;ome to him, and he earns his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence with pain; but this little animal &s;eems happy in its pur&s;uits, and finds delight in all its employments.</P>
<P>When bees fir&s;t begin to break their pri&s;ons, there are generally above a hundred excluded in one day. Thus, in the &s;pace of a few weeks, the number of the inhabitants in one hive, of moderate &s;ize, becomes &s;o great, that there is no place to contain the new comers; and they are &s;carcely excluded from the cell, when they are obliged, by the old bees, to &s;ally forth in que&s;t of new habitations. In other words, the hive begins to &s;warm, and the new progeny prepares for exile.</P>
<P>While there is room enough in the hive, the bees remain quietly together; it is nece&s;&s;ity alone that compels the &s;eparation. Sometimes indeed, the young brood, with gracele&s;s ob&s;ti|nacy, refu&s;e to depart, and even venture to re&s;i&s;t their progenitors. The young ones are known by being browner than the old, with whiter hair; the old ones are of a lighter co|lour, with red hair. The two armies are there|fore ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hable, and dreadful battles are often &s;een to en&s;ue. But the victory al|mo&s;t
<PB N="74" REF="030190_0078_0FE50533C6E66738">
ever terminates, with &s;trict political ju&s;t|ice, in favour of the veterans, and the rebellious offspring are driven off, not without lo&s;s and mutilation.</P>
<P>In different countries, the &s;warms make their appearance at different times of the year, and there are &s;everal &s;igns previous to this intended migration. The night before, an unu&s;ual buz|ing is heard in the hive; in the morning, though the weather be &s;oft and inviting, they &s;eem not to obey the call, being intent on more important meditations within. All labour is di&s;continued in the hive, every bee is either employed in forcing, or reluctantly yielding a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; at length, after &s;ome noi&s;e and tumult, a queen bee is cho&s;en, to guard, ra|ther than conduct, the young colony to other habitations, and then they are mar&s;halled with|out any apparent conductor. In le&s;s than a mi|nute, they leave their native abode, and form|ing a cloud round their protectre&s;s, they &s;et off, without &s;eeming to know the place of their de&s;tination; <HI>The world before them, where to choo&s;e their place of re&s;t.</HI> The u&s;ual time of &s;warming, is from ten in the morning, to three in the afternoon, when the &s;un &s;hines bright, and invites them to &s;eek their fortunes. They flutter for a while, in the air, like flakes of &s;now, and &s;ometimes undertake a di&s;tant jour|ney, but more frequently are contented with &s;ome neighbouring a&s;ylum; the branch of a tree, a chimney top, or &s;ome other expo&s;ed &s;it|uation. It is, indeed, remarkable, that all tho&s;e animals, of whatever kind, that have long been under the protection of man, &s;eem
<PB N="75" REF="030190_0079_0FE504B9F0978788">
to lo&s;e a part of their natural &s;agacity, in pro|viding for them&s;elves. The rabbit, when do|me&s;ticated, forgets to dig holes, the hen to build a ne&s;t, and the bee to &s;eek a &s;helter, that &s;hall protect it from the inclemencies of winter. In tho&s;e countries, where the bees are wild, and unprotected by man, they are always &s;ure to build their waxen cells in the hollow of a tree; but with us, they &s;eem im|provident in their choice, and the fir&s;t green branch that &s;tops their flight, &s;eems to be thought &s;ufficient for their abode through win|ter. However, it does not appear, that the queen choo&s;es the place where they are to alight, for many of the &s;tragglers, who &s;eem to be plea&s;ed with a particular branch, go and &s;ettle upon it; others are &s;een to &s;ucceed, and at la&s;t, the queen her&s;elf, when &s;he finds a &s;ufficient number there before her, goes to make it the place of her head quarters. When the queen is &s;ettled, the re&s;t of the &s;warm &s;oon follow; and, in about a quarter of an hour, the whole body &s;eem to be at ea&s;e. It &s;ometimes is found, that there are two or three queens to a &s;warm, and the colony is divided into parties; but it mo&s;t u&s;ually happens, that one of the&s;e is more con&s;iderable than the other, and the bees by degrees, de&s;ert the weake&s;t, to take &s;helter under the mo&s;t powerful protector. The de|&s;erted queen does not long &s;urvive this defeat; &s;he takes refuge under the new monarch, and is &s;oon de&s;troyed by her jealous rival. Till this cruel execution is performed, the bees ne|ver go out to work; and if there &s;hould be a queen-bee, belonging to the new colony, left
<PB N="76" REF="030190_0080_0FE5053553A5C518">
in the old hive, &s;he always undergoes the fate of the former. However, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the bees never &s;acrifice any of their queens, when the hive is full of wax and honey; for there is at that time, no danger in maintaining a plurality of breeders.</P>
<P>When the &s;warm is thus conducted to a place of re&s;t, and the policy of government is &s;ettled, the bees &s;oon re&s;ume their former labours.</P>
<P>When a hive &s;ends out &s;everal &s;warms in the year, the fir&s;t is always the be&s;t, and the mo&s;t numerous. The&s;e, having the whole &s;ummer before them, have the more time for making wax and honey, and con&s;equently their labours are the mo&s;t valuable to the proprietor. Al|though the &s;warm chiefly con&s;i&s;ts of the young|e&s;t bees, yet it is often found, that bees of all ages compo&s;e the multitude of emigrants, and it often happens, that bees of all ages are &s;een remaining behind. The number of them is always more con&s;iderable than that of &s;ome po|pulous cities, for &s;ometimes upwards of forty thou&s;and are found in a &s;ingle hive. So large a body may well be &s;uppo&s;ed to work with great expedition; and in fact, in le&s;s than twenty four hours, they will make combs above twenty inches long, and &s;even or eight broad. Some|times they will half fill their hives with wax, in le&s;s than five days. In the fir&s;t fifteen days, they are always found to make more wax than they do afterwards during the re&s;t of the year.</P>
<P>Having mentioned the indu&s;try of the&s;e ad|mirable in&s;ects, it will be proper to &s;ay &s;ome|thing of the effects of their labour, of that wax and honey, which are turned by man to &s;uch
<PB N="77" REF="030190_0081_0FE504BB7AC10FB8">
various u&s;es. Bees gather together two kinds of wax, one coar&s;e and the other fine. The coar&s;er &s;ort is bitter, and with this, which is called <HI>propolis,</HI> they &s;top up all the holes and crevices of their hives. It is of a more re&s;inous nature than the fine wax, and is con&s;equently better qualified to re&s;i&s;t the moi&s;ture of the &s;ea&s;on, and pre&s;erve the works warm and dry within. The fine wax is as nece&s;&s;ary to the animals pre&s;ervation as the honey it&s;elf. With this they make their lodgings, with this they cover the cells of their young, and in this they lay up their magazines of honey. This is made, as has been already ob&s;erved, from the du&s;t of flowers, which is carefully kneaded by the lit|tle in&s;ect, then &s;wallowed, and having under|gone a kind of dige&s;tion, is formed into the cells, which an&s;wers &s;uch a variety of purpo&s;es. To collect this, the animal rolls it&s;elf in the flower it would rob, and thus takes up the ve|getable du&s;t with the hair of its body. Then carefully bru&s;hing it into a lump, with its fore|paws it thru&s;ts the compo&s;ition into two cavi|ties behind the thighs, which are made like &s;poons to receive the wax, and the hair that lines them, &s;erves to keep it from falling.</P>
<P>As of wax, there are al&s;o two kinds of ho|ney. The white and the yellow. The white is taken without fire from the honey-combs. The yellow is extracted by heat, and &s;queezed through bags, in a pre&s;s. The be&s;t honey is new, thick and granulated, of a clear tran&s;pa|rent white colour, of a &s;oft and aromatic &s;mell, and of a &s;weet lively ta&s;te. Honey made in mountainous countries, is preferable to that of
<PB N="78" REF="030190_0082_0FE50536DD0736A0">
the valley. The honey made in the &s;pring, is more highly e&s;teemed, than that gathered in &s;ummer, which la&s;t is &s;till more valuable, than that of autumn, when the flowers begin to fade and lo&s;e their fragrance.</P>

<P>Though &s;ilk was anciently brought in &s;mall quantities to Rome, yet it was &s;o &s;carce as to be &s;old for its weight in gold; and was con&s;i|dered as &s;uch a luxurious refinement in dre&s;s, that it was infamous for a man to appear in ha|bits of which &s;ilk formed but half the compo|&s;ition. It was mo&s;t probably brought among them from the remote&s;t parts of the ea&s;t; &s;ince it was, at that time of which I am &s;peaking, &s;carcely known even in Per&s;ia.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more remote from the truth, than the manner in which their hi&s;torians de|&s;cribe the animal by which &s;ilk is produced. Pau&s;anius informs us, that &s;ilk came from the country of the Seres, a people of A&s;iatic Scy|thia;
<PB N="97" REF="030190_0083_0FE504BD2997B480">
in which place an in&s;ect, as large as the beetle, but in every other re&s;pect re&s;embling a &s;pider, was bred up for that purpo&s;e. They take great care, as he a&s;&s;ures us, to feed and defend it from the weather; as well during the &s;ummer's heat, as the rigours of winter. This in&s;ect, he ob&s;erves, makes its web with its feet, of which it has eight in number. It is fed, for the &s;pace of four years, upon a kind of pa&s;te, prepared for it; and at the beginning of the fifth, it is &s;upplied with leaves of the green willow, of which it is particularly fond; it then feeds till it bur&s;ts with fat: after which they take out its bowels, which are &s;pun into the beautiful manufacture &s;o &s;carce and co&s;tly.</P>
<P>The real hi&s;tory of this animal was unknown among the Romans till the times of Ju&s;tinian; and it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that &s;ilkworms were not brought into Europe till the beginning of the twelfth century; when Roger of Sicily, brought workmen in this manufacture from A&s;ia Minor, after his return from his expedition to the Ho|ly Land, and &s;ettled them in Sicily and Cala|bria. From the&s;e the other kingdoms of Eu|rope learned this manufacture; and it is now one of the mo&s;t lucrative carried on among the &s;outhern provinces of Europe.</P>
<P>The &s;ilkworm is now very well known to be a large caterpillar, of a whiti&s;h colour, with twelve feet, and producing a butterfly of the moth kind. The cone on which it &s;pins, is formed for covering it while it continues in the aurelia &s;tate; and &s;everal of the&s;e properly wound off, and united together, form tho&s;e &s;trong and beautiful threads, which are woven into
<PB N="80" REF="030190_0084_0FE50543181C60E8">
&s;ilk. The feeding the&s;e worms, the gathering, the winding, the twi&s;ting, and the weaving their &s;ilk, is one of the principal manufactures of Europe; and, as their luxuries increa&s;e, &s;eems every day to become more and more nece&s;&s;ary to human happine&s;s.</P>
<P>There are two methods of breeding &s;ilk|worms; for they may be left to grow, and re|main at liberty upon the trees where they are hatched; or they may be kept in a place built for that purpo&s;e, and fed every day with fre&s;h leaves. The fir&s;t method is u&s;ed in China, Tonquin, and other hot countries; the other is u&s;ed in other places where the animal has been artificially propagated, and &s;till continues a &s;tranger. In the warm climates, the &s;ilk|worm proceeds from an egg, which has been glued by the parent moth upon proper parts of the mulberry-tree, and which remains in that &s;ituation during the winter. The manner in which they are &s;ituated and fixed to the tree, keeps them unaffected by the influence of the weather; &s;o that tho&s;e fro&s;ts which are &s;evere enough to kill the tree, have no power to in|jure the &s;ilkworm.</P>
<P>The in&s;ect never proceeds from the egg till Nature has provided it a &s;ufficient &s;upply; and till the budding leaves are furni&s;hed, in &s;uf|ficient abundance, for its &s;upport. When the leaves are put forth, the worms &s;eem to feel the genial &s;ummons, and bur&s;ting from their little eggs, crawl upon the leaves, where they feed with a mo&s;t voracious appetite. Thus they become larger by degrees; and after &s;ome months feeding, they lay, upon every leaf,
<PB N="81" REF="030190_0085_0FE504CA71E521E0">
&s;mall bundles, or cones of &s;ilk, which appear like &s;o many golden apples, painted on a fine green ground. Such is the method of breed|ing them in the Ea&s;t; and without doubt it is be&s;t for the worms, and lea&s;t trouble&s;ome for the feeder of them. But it is otherwi&s;e in the colder European climates; the frequent chan|ges of the weather, and the heavy dews of the evenings render the keeping them all night ex|po&s;ed, &s;ubject to &s;o many inconveniences, as to admit of no remedy. It is true, that by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of nets, they may be pre&s;erved from the in&s;ults of birds; but the &s;evere cold weather, which often &s;ucceeds the fir&s;t heats of &s;ummer, as well as the rain and high winds, will de&s;troy them all: and therefore, to breed them in Europe, they mu&s;t be &s;heltered and protected from every external injury.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e, a room is cho&s;en, with a &s;outh a&s;pect; and the windows are &s;o well gla|zed, as not to admit the lea&s;t air: the walls are well built, and the planks of the floor ex|ceeding clo&s;e, &s;o as to admit neither birds nor mice, nor even &s;o much as an in&s;ect. In the middle there &s;hould be four pillars erected, or four wooden po&s;ts, &s;o placed as to form a pret|ty large &s;quare. Between the&s;e are different &s;tories made with ozier hurdles; and under each hurdle there &s;hould be a floor, with an upright border all round. The&s;e hurdles and floors mu&s;t hang upon pullies, &s;o as to be pla|ced, or taken down at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>When the worms are hatched, &s;ome tender mulberry leaves are provided, and placed in the cloth or paper box in which the eggs were
<PB N="82" REF="030190_0086_0FE50544D09E8058">
laid, and which are large enough to hold a great number. When they have acquired &s;ome &s;trength, they mu&s;t be di&s;tributed on beds of mulberry leaves, in the different &s;tories of the &s;quare in the middle of the room, round which a per&s;on may freely pa&s;s on every &s;ide. They will fix them&s;elves to the leaves, and af|terwards to the &s;ticks of the hurdles, when the leaves are devoured. They have then a thread, by which they can &s;u&s;pend them&s;elves on occa|&s;ion, to prevent any &s;hock by a fall; but this is by no means to be con&s;idered as the &s;ilk which they &s;pin afterwards in &s;uch abundance. Care mu&s;t be taken that fre&s;h leaves be brought every morning, which mu&s;t be &s;trewed very gently and equally over them; upon which the &s;ilkworms will for&s;ake the remainder of the old leaves, which mu&s;t be carefully taken away, and every thing kept very clean; for nothing hurts the&s;e in&s;ects &s;o much as moi&s;ture and uncleanline&s;s. For this rea&s;on their leaves mu&s;t be gathered when the weather is dry, and kept in a dry place, if it be nece&s;&s;ary to lay in a &s;tore. As the&s;e animals have but a &s;hort time to live, they make u&s;e of every moment, and almo&s;t continually are &s;pinning except at tho&s;e intervals when they change their &s;kins. If mulberry leaves be difficult to be obtained, the leaves of lettuce or holyoak will &s;u&s;tain them: but they do not thrive &s;o well upon their new diet; and their &s;ilk will neither be &s;o copious, nor of &s;o good a quality.</P>
<P>Though the judicious choice, and careful management of their diet, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary, yet there is another precaution of equal
<PB N="83" REF="030190_0087_0FE504CCA6C32820">
importance, which is to give them air, and open their chamber windows, at &s;uch times as the &s;un &s;hines warme&s;t. The place al&s;o mu&s;t be kept as clean as po&s;&s;ible; not only the &s;eve|ral floors that are laid to receive their ordure, but the whole apartments in general. The&s;e things well ob&s;erved, contribute greatly to their health and encrea&s;e.</P>
<P>The worm, at the time it bur&s;ts the &s;hell, is extremely &s;mall, and of a black colour; but the head is of a more &s;hining black than the re&s;t of the body: &s;ome days after, they begin to turn whiti&s;h, or of an a&s;h-coloured grey. After the &s;kin begins to grow too rigid, or the animal is &s;tinted within it, the in&s;ect throws it off, and appears cloathed a-new: it then becomes larger and much whiter, though it has a greeni&s;h ca&s;t: after &s;ome days, which are more or le&s;s, according to the different heat of the climate, or to the quality of the food it leaves off eating, and &s;eems to &s;leep for two days together: then it begins to &s;tir, and put it&s;elf into violent motions, till the &s;kin falls off the &s;econd time, and is thrown a&s;ide by the ani|mal's feet. All the&s;e changes are made in three weeks or a month's time; after which it be|gins to feed once more, &s;till in its caterpillar form, but a good deal differing from it&s;elf be|fore its change. In a few days time it &s;eems to &s;leep again; and, when it awakes, it again changes its cloathing, and continues feeding as before. When it has thus taken a &s;uffici|ency of food, and its parts are di&s;po&s;ed for a&s;|&s;uming the aurelia form, the animal for&s;akes, for the la&s;t time, all food and &s;ociety, and pre|pares
<PB N="84" REF="030190_0088_0FE4FD063B963DF0">
it&s;elf a retreat to defend it from external injuries, while it is &s;eemingly deprived of life and motion.</P>
<P>This retreat is no other than its cone, or ball of &s;ilk, which Nature has taught it to compo&s;e with great art; and within which it buries it&s;elf, till it a&s;&s;umes its winged form. This cone or ball is &s;pun from two little long|i&s;h kinds of bags that lie above the inte&s;tines, and are filled with a gummy fluid, of a mari|gold colour. This is the &s;ub&s;tance of which the threads are formed; and the little animal is furni&s;hed with a &s;urpri&s;ing apparatus for &s;pinning it to the degree of finene&s;s which its occa&s;ions may require. This in&s;trument in &s;ome mea&s;ure re&s;embles a wire-drawer's ma|chine, in which gold or &s;ilver threads are drawn to any degree of minutene&s;s; and through this the animal draws its thread with great a&s;&s;idu|ity. As every thread proceeds from two gum-bags, it is probable that each &s;upplies its own; which, however, are united, as they proceed from the animal's body. If we examine the thread with a micro&s;cope, it will be found that it is flatted on one &s;ide, and grooved along its length; from hence we may infer, that it is doubled ju&s;t upon leaving the body; and that the two threads &s;tick to each other by that gummy quality of which they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Previous to &s;pinning its web, the &s;ilkworm &s;eeks out &s;ome convenient place to erect its cell, without any ob&s;truction. When it has found a leaf, or a chink fitted to its purpo&s;e, it be|gins to wreathe its head in every direction, and fa&s;tens its thread on every &s;ide to the &s;ides of
<PB N="85" REF="030190_0089_0FE504CE358CF430">
its retreat. Though all its fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays &s;eem perfectly confu&s;ed, yet they are not altogether without de&s;ign: there appears indeed, no or|der or contrivance in the di&s;po&s;al of its fir&s;t threads; they are by no means laid artfully over each other, but are thrown out at random, to &s;erve as an external &s;helter again&s;t rain; for nature having appointed the animal to work upon trees in the open air, its habits remain, though it is brought up in a warm apartment.</P>
<P>Malpighi pretends to have ob&s;erved &s;ix dif|ferent layers in a &s;ingle cone of &s;ilk: but what may ea&s;ily be ob&s;erved is, that it is compo&s;ed externally of a kind of rough cotton-like &s;ub|&s;tance, which is called flo&s;s; within the thread it is more di&s;tinct and even; and next the body of the aurelia, the apartment &s;eems lined with a &s;ub&s;tance of the hardne&s;s of paper, but of a much &s;tronger con&s;i&s;tence. It mu&s;t not be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the thread which goes to com|po&s;e the cone, is rolled round, as we roll a bottom; on the contrary, it lies upon it in a very irregular manner, and winds off from one &s;ide of the cone, and then from the other. This whole thread, if mea&s;ured, will be found about three hundred yards long; and &s;o very fine, that eight or ten of them are generally rolled off into one by the manufacturers. The cone, when completed, is in form like a pi|geon's egg, and more pointed at one end than the other; at the &s;maller end, the head of the aurelia is generally found; and this is the place that the in&s;ect, when converted into a moth, is generally &s;een to bur&s;t through.</P>
<P>It is generally a fortnight or three weeks be|fore
<PB N="86" REF="030190_0090_0FE5054B534B21F8">
the aurelia is changed into a moth; but no &s;ooner is the winged in&s;ect completely form|ed, than having dive&s;ted it&s;elf of its aurelia &s;kin, it prepares to bur&s;t through its cone, or outward pri&s;on: for this purpo&s;e it extends its head towards the point of the cone, butts with its eyes, which are rough, again&s;t the lining of its cell, wears it away, and at la&s;t pu&s;hes forward, through a pa&s;&s;age which is &s;mall at fir&s;t, but which enlarges as the animal encrea&s;es its efforts for emancipation; while the tattered remnants of its aurelia &s;kin lie in confu&s;ion within the cone, like a bundle of dirty linen.</P>
<P>The animal, when thus &s;et free from its double confinement, appears exhau&s;ted with fatigue, and &s;eems produced for no other pur|po&s;e but to tran&s;mit a future brood. It nei|ther flies nor eats; the male only &s;eeking the female, who&s;e eggs he impregnates; and their union continues for four days, without inter|ruption. The male dies immediately after &s;e|paration from his mate; and &s;he &s;urvives him only till &s;he has laid her eggs, which are not hatched into worms till the en&s;uing &s;pring.</P>
<P>However, there are few of the&s;e animals &s;uffered to come to a &s;tate of maturity; for as their bur&s;ting through the cone de&s;troys the &s;ilk, the manufacturers take care to kill the au|relia, by expo&s;ing it to the &s;un, before the moth comes to perfection. This done, they take off the flo&s;s, and throw the cones into warm water, &s;tirring them till the fir&s;t thread offers them a clue for winding all off. They generally take eight of the &s;ilken threads to|gether; the cones &s;till keep under water, till
<PB N="87" REF="030190_0091_0FE504CFC4BF64A0">
a proper quantity of the &s;ilk is wound off: however, they do not take all; for the latter parts grow weak, and are of a bad colour. As to the paper-like &s;ub&s;tance which remains, &s;ome &s;tain it with a variety of colours, to make artificial flowers; others let it lie in the water, till the glutinous matter which cements it is all di&s;&s;olved: it is then carded like wool, &s;pun with a wheel, and converted into &s;ilk &s;tuffs of an inferior kind.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE re&s;ources of the human mind in &s;truggling again&s;t misfortunes are never &s;o well under&s;tood, as in &s;ituations of di&s;tre&s;s and difficulty. Nothing is &s;o
<PB N="95" REF="030190_0099_0FE504EFA87B53B8">
feeble, nothing &s;o helple&s;s, as a being that has been ac|cu&s;tomed to &s;ub&s;i&s;t by the labour of others, without the lea&s;t exertion. This is one of the di&s;advantages attending a &s;tate of refinement and civilization. Mankind forget the &s;imple dictates of rea&s;on and nature, and make a thou&s;and pernicious indulgences nece&s;&s;ary to their ideas of happine&s;s. One man imagines that it is impo&s;&s;ible to tran&s;port him&s;elf from place to place, without the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of other animals, who are to relieve him from the fatigue of u&s;ing his own legs; another, that it is impo&s;|&s;ible to &s;upply his hunger without a &s;plendid table, co|vered with the productions of every climate; a third cannot &s;leep unle&s;s upon beds of down, and in a palace. Thus are a thou&s;and things made nece&s;&s;ary to our happi|ne&s;s, which have no natural connexion with it, and our lives are con&s;umed in the acqui&s;ition of &s;uperfluous tri|fles. Our vanity, ever ingenious to torment us, ren|ders us incapable of repo&s;e, and prompts us to be con|tinually making u&s;ele&s;s compari&s;ons with all around.</P>
<P>Surely, in this re&s;pect, the uncultured Savage that inhabits the woods, and a&s;ks no more than a &s;kin to repel the winds of winter, an hut to defend him from the &s;torms, and a moderate quantity of the coar&s;e&s;t food, is happier far than we. He views the whole detail of luxury with indifference and contempt, and prefers his native woods and plains to all the magnificence of our cities; nor would the mo&s;t effeminate native of our cap|ital be more mortified to inhabit the rude&s;t fore&s;ts, than he to exchange them for the endle&s;s re&s;traints and cere|monies, which we &s;ubmit to in civilized &s;ociety. He &s;leeps as &s;ound upon a bed of gra&s;s and leaves, and gra|tifies his hunger as &s;atisfactorily with roa&s;ted corn, or millet, as a rich and indolent citizen can do with all the accumulated inventions of arts and manufactures. But in the entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all his bodily faculties, how great is the &s;uperiority of the Savage! The inhabit|ant of cities, pale, feeble, and bloated, drags on a tedi|ous exi&s;tence with difficulty, under the incumbrance of an hundred di&s;ea&s;es, to which his intemperance has
<PB N="96" REF="030190_0100_0FE4FD145649BBF8">
&s;ubjected him. Before half his life is run out, we fre|quently behold him incapable of u&s;ing his limbs; and that idlene&s;s, which was at fir&s;t voluntary, becomes in|evitable, from the imbecility he has contracted. In vain would the beautiful revolution of the &s;ea&s;ons attract his notice, or call him out to &s;hare the common ble&s;&s;ings which nature di&s;pen&s;es to all her uncorrupted offspring. Neither the care of his own nece&s;&s;ary affairs, the defence of his country, nor even fears for his own per&s;onal &s;afe|ty, can any longer animate him to the &s;malle&s;t exertion; and &s;hould he not be in a &s;ituation to buy the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of others, he mu&s;t remain for ever attached to one &s;pot, like a mu&s;cle or an oy&s;ter. How different from this is the life of an American Indian, or a Tartar! Accu&s;tom|ed from his infancy to contend with dangers and diffi|culties, he becomes hardened again&s;t all the vici&s;&s;itudes of nature, again&s;t all the attacks of fortune. Wherever the earth extends her &s;urface, he finds a bed; the fore&s;t affords him all the &s;helter he demands; and he can every where procure, by his own indu&s;try, &s;ufficient food to &s;upply his wants. In the u&s;e of his limbs, and the full enjoyment of all his natural powers, he is not exceeded by the very bea&s;ts that fly before him. Such are all the uncivilized nations with which we were formerly ac|quainted; &s;uch are tho&s;e which are lately added to our knowledge by modern di&s;coveries.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t extraordinary in&s;tances of the exertions of human beings in difficult &s;ituations, are to be found in the lives of &s;uch men, as have been compelled by &s;hipwreck to remain for &s;everal years on uninhabited i&s;lands. Deprived in an in&s;tant of all the advantages and &s;upport which we derive from mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance, they have been obliged to call forth all the latent re&s;our|ces of their own minds. From a contemplation of the&s;e we are enabled to form &s;ome ideas of the wonderful pow|ers of the human con&s;titution, when properly &s;timulated to action by nece&s;&s;ity. The following narrative, whe|ther real or fictitious, &s;eems to be admirably adapted to the illu&s;tration of this &s;ubject, and therefore we &s;hall make no apology for re-printing it in this collection.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF PHILIP QUARLL.</HEAD>
<P>PHILIP QUARLL was an Engli&s;h &s;ailor, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted to navigate a &s;hip in the &s;outh|ern &s;eas of America. During his voyage, they were a&s;&s;ailed by &s;uch a violent tempe&s;t, which la&s;ted, without intermi&s;&s;ion, for two days and nights, that the captain and mo&s;t experienced mariners began to de&s;pair of the &s;afety of the &s;hip. In this exigency, Quarll, being bold and active, took a hatch|et in his hand, and ran up the &s;hrouds, by the captain's order, to cut away the main|yard, which they could not lower; but by the time he had mounted, there came a &s;ea, which da&s;hed the &s;hip again&s;t a rock, and, with the violence of the motion, flung Quarll, who was a&s;tride upon the main|yard, on the top of the rock, where, hav|ing
<PB N="98" REF="030190_0103_0FE50564D7A89078">
the good fortune to fall into a clift, he was &s;ecured from being wa&s;hed back again into the &s;ea and drowned, as all the re&s;t were that belonged to the &s;hip.</P>
<P>Quarll, in a di&s;mal condition, remained the &s;ucceeding night in the clift, being continually beaten with the da&s;hing back of the &s;ea, and being both brui&s;ed and numb|ed, pulled off his cloaths, which were drip|ping wet, over fatigued, lays him&s;elf down on the &s;moothe&s;t place of the rock he could find, being quite &s;pent with the hard&s;hip he had undergone, and &s;lept while his cloaths were drying.</P>
<P>His &s;leep, though very profound, was not refre&s;hing: the danger he had been lately in, &s;o ran in his mind, that death was ever before his eyes, and con&s;tantly di&s;turbed his re&s;t: but nature, which wanted repo&s;e, would be &s;upplied. Having &s;lept a few hours, he awakes almo&s;t as much fatigued as before, and faint for want of nouri&s;h|ment, having taken none for thirty-&s;ix hours before: &s;o, having looked upon his cloaths, which he perceived were not quite dry, he turned the other &s;ide to the &s;un, and laid him&s;elf down to &s;leep again: but &s;till nothing but horror entered his mind.</P>
<P>When he awoke, he was very much ter|rified with his dreams, and &s;tared about him in a frighted manner, expecting every mi|nute &s;ome creature to devour him; but, taking a little courage, put on his cloaths, which by this time were quite dry. He then looks about him; but, alas! could &s;ee
<PB N="99" REF="030190_0104_0FE505666339F990">
nothing but the dreadful effects of the late tempe&s;t; dead corp&s;es, broken planks, and battered che&s;ts floating; and &s;uch &s;ights as at once filled him with terror and grief.</P>
<P>Turning from tho&s;e &s;hocking objects, which pre&s;ented to his eyes the dreadful death he &s;o lately had e&s;caped, he &s;ees on the other &s;ide, the pro&s;pect of one more terrible, hunger and thir&s;t, attended with all the mi&s;eries that can make life burthen|&s;ome. Being &s;eized with the terror of the threatening evil, he turns again towards the &s;ea, and looking on the dead corp&s;es, which the &s;ea now and then drove to the rock, and back again, <Q>Oh! that I was like one of you, &s;aid he, pa&s;t all dangers! I have &s;hared with you in the terrors of death: why did I not al&s;o partake with you in its relief? But why &s;hould I com|plain? and have &s;o much rea&s;on to be thankful! Had I been cut off, when the cares of &s;aving this worthle&s;s carca&s;e in|tercepted me from &s;eeking the &s;alvation of my &s;oul, I &s;hould not have had the pre|&s;ent opportunity of taking care of it.</Q> So, having returned thanks for his late de|liverance, he re&s;igns him&s;elf to Providence, on whom he fully relies; climbs up the rock, and being come to the top, &s;ees land on the in&s;ide, bearing both trees and gra&s;s: <Q>Hea|ven be prai&s;ed! &s;aid he: I &s;hall not peri&s;h upon the&s;e barren rocks:</Q> &s;o made a &s;hift to go down to it, the weather then being calm.</P>
<P>Being come to the other &s;ide of the rock,
<PB N="100" REF="030190_0105_0FE50569ABA98D20">
he finds at the bottom of it a narrow lake, which &s;eparated it from the land: there|fore, pulling off his cloaths, the water be|ing but &s;hallow, he wades over with them in his arms; and dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf, walks up a con&s;iderable way in the i&s;land, without &s;eeing any human creature, or perceiving any &s;ign of its being inhabited, which &s;truck a great damp to his &s;pirits. He walks it over and over, cro&s;s-ways and long-ways; yet could &s;ee nothing but monkeys, &s;trange bea&s;ts, birds, and fowls, &s;uch as he had never &s;een before.</P>
<P>Having ranged him&s;elf weary, he &s;at down under a clu&s;ter of trees, that made an agreeable arbour. The place being plea|&s;ant and cool, made, as it were, for repo&s;e, and he being &s;till very much fatigued, prompted him to lie down and &s;leep, during which, his mind is continually alarmed with the frightful a&s;pect of grim death. Some|times, he fancies him&s;elf &s;triving with the rolling waves, &s;tretching out his arm to catch hold of a plank to&s;&s;ing by; which, ju&s;t come at, is beaten back by the roaring billows, who&s;e terrible noi&s;e pronounces his death. At other times, he thinks him|&s;elf a&s;tride upon a piece of a ma&s;t, labouring to keep him&s;elf on, and of a &s;udden wa&s;hed away, and &s;unk down by a bulkey wave; on every &s;ide of him men calling for help; others &s;pent and pa&s;t &s;peaking; here &s;ome floating that are already peri&s;hed, and there others expiring; thus, in every object, &s;ee|ing his approaching fate.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="030190_0106_0FE505735BCB14F0">
Being awaked out of that irk&s;ome and unea&s;y &s;leep, he falls into as anxious and melancholy thoughts: <Q>I have, &s;aid he, e&s;caped being drowned, but how &s;hall I avoid &s;tarving? here is no food for man. But why &s;hould I de&s;pair? Cannot I eat gra&s;s for a few days? by which time, Providence, which has hitherto protect|ed me, may rai&s;e me &s;ome means to get from hence.</Q> So, being entirely re&s;igned, he walks about to &s;ee the i&s;land, which he found &s;urrounded with rocks, at the bot|tom of which there was a &s;mall lake, which was fordable in mo&s;t places, &s;o that he could with ea&s;e wade over to the rock; which he did at every &s;ide of the i&s;land, to &s;ee if he could perceive any &s;hip, whereby he might get away: but, &s;eeing none, and it draw|ing towards night, he returns, and employs the remainder of the day in looking for the mo&s;t convenient place for him to pa&s;s away the approaching night; and, having fixed upon one of the highe&s;t trees, he gets up as far as he well could, fearing &s;ome wild bea&s;t might devour him if he &s;lept below; where, having returned thanks to Heaven for his late great deliverance, he commits him&s;elf to its care; then &s;ettles, and falls to &s;leep, and &s;lept till hunger awaked him in the morning, having dreamt over night of abundance of victuals, which he would fain have come at, but was kept off by a cro&s;s cook, who bid him go and fi&s;h for &s;ome. To which he an&s;wered, that he was &s;hip-wrecked, and had nothing to fi&s;h withal.
<PB N="102" REF="030190_0107_0FE50574E51FC8C0">
"Well then," &s;aid the cook to him again, <Q>go where thou wa&s;t like to lo&s;e thy life, and there thou &s;halt find wherewithal to &s;upport it.</Q></P>
<P>Being awaked, he makes reflexions upon his dream, which he imagined might pro|ceed from the emptine&s;s of his &s;tomach, be|ing cu&s;tomary for people to dream of vic|tuals when they go to bed hungry. But, driven by nece&s;&s;ity, and led by curio&s;ity, he went to the &s;ame &s;ide of the rock he had been ca&s;t upon; where, having &s;tood &s;everal hours without &s;eeing &s;hipping, or aught that might an&s;wer his dream, the air com|ing from the &s;ea being pretty &s;harp, and he faint, having taken no manner of food for near three days, he gave over all hopes of relief. Thus &s;ubmitting him&s;elf to the will of Heaven, which he &s;uppo&s;ed decreed a lingering death to puni&s;h him for his pa&s;t &s;ins, he re&s;olves to return where he lay the night before, and there wait for his doom; but being &s;topped by a &s;udden noi&s;e which i&s;&s;ued from a creek in the rock, not far from where he &s;tood, he had the curio&s;ity to go and &s;ee what occa&s;ioned it.</P>
<P>Being come to the place he heard the noi&s;e proceed from, he &s;ees a fine large cod|fi&s;h, near &s;ix feet long, dabbling in a hole in the rock, where the late &s;torm had ca&s;t it.</P>
<P>One under condemnation of death, and ju&s;t arrived at the place of execution, could not be more rejoiced at the coming of a re|prieve, than he was at the &s;ight of this fi&s;h, having felt &s;everal &s;ick qualms, fore-runners
<PB N="103" REF="030190_0108_0FE505766E6C1FF0">
of the death he thought he was doomed to. <Q>Heaven be prai&s;ed! &s;aid he, here is &s;ub&s;i&s;tance for &s;everal days!</Q></P>
<P>So, having taken off both his garters, he gets into the hole where the fi&s;h lay, and having run them through its gills, he hauls it out, and drags it after him, being heavy, and he very weak. Going along, he finds &s;everal oy&s;ters, mu&s;cles, and cockles, in his way, which the &s;ea had ca&s;t up and down the rock; and having a knife about him, he &s;at down and ate a few; &s;o refre&s;hed him&s;elf, his &s;pirits being exhau&s;ted for want of food. This &s;mall nutriment very much recruited his decayed &s;trength, and the thoughts of his &s;upply of provi&s;ion having di&s;per&s;ed the dull ideas his late want had bred in his mind, he cheerfully takes his fi&s;h, which he drags with much more vigour than before; and filling his pocket with &s;alt that was congeal|by the &s;un, which he found in the concavi|ties of the rock, away he goes to the place where he lay the night before, in order to dre&s;s &s;ome of the cod-fi&s;h; where being come, he picks up a parcel of dry leaves, and with his knife and a flint &s;truck fire, and kindled them: then getting together a few &s;ticks, made a fire pre&s;ently, and broiled a &s;lice of his fi&s;h; of which he ate &s;o heartily, that it overcame his &s;tomach, being grown weak with fa&s;ting. Thus &s;ick, and out of order, he applies to the recour&s;e of the fee|ble, which was lying down; and having much fatigued and harra&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with
<PB N="104" REF="030190_0109_0FE50579C78EC4C8">
hauling the heavy fi&s;h up and down the rock, he fell a&s;leep until the next morning.</P>
<P>Having &s;lept quietly the remainder of the night, he awoke in the morning pretty fre&s;h and hearty, but anxious about his future de&s;tiny; for though he might for a while &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon fi&s;h, wherewith he might be &s;upplied by the &s;ea, yet he could not ima|gine which way he could be furni&s;hed with cloaths and bed again&s;t the winter; for want of which he mu&s;t mi&s;erably peri&s;h with cold, unle&s;s &s;upplied by &s;ome &s;uch di&s;|mal accident as expo&s;ed him to the want thereof, which he heartily wi&s;hes and prays may never happen.</P>
<P>Having made the&s;e con&s;iderations, he, on his knees, returns kind Providence his hearty thanks for all its mercies that had been extended to him; begging the conti|nuance of its a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Then, watching the opportunity of getting away from that melancholy place, he goes to the other &s;ide of the rock, to try if he could perceive any &s;hipping in &s;ight.</P>
<P>The wind being pretty high, fed his hopes, that each &s;ucceeding hour would gratify his wi&s;hing look, with that object the preceding could not bring forth: but he was di&s;appointed. The night approach|ing, kept back all probability for that time; however, depending on better &s;ucce&s;s the next day, he returns whence he came: and being hungry, makes a fire, and broils an|other &s;lice of the fi&s;h, then lays the re&s;t up|on broad green leaves, and &s;trews &s;alt there|on
<PB N="105" REF="030190_0110_0FE5058342D99958">
to keep it from &s;poiling, and then goes to re&s;t; and as he lay undi&s;turbed the night before under the trees, and much more ea&s;y than at top, he ventured again, committing him&s;elf to the care of Providence.</P>
<P>He &s;lept in &s;afety that night; but with the returning morning, all his anxieties were renewed, and he determined to lo&s;e no time in providing, as well as he could, for all his nece&s;&s;ities. Accordingly, fir&s;t he begins to think of making him&s;elf an hou&s;e to pre&s;erve him from the injuries of the weather: but having nothing to make it of, nor any in&s;trument but a knife, which could be of little &s;ervice to him, he re&s;olves to go to that part of the rock where he was &s;hipwrecked, to &s;ee if he could di&s;co|ver any thing among the wreck that might be &s;erviceable to him: and therefore takes a branch of a tree along with him, and coming to the place, he &s;trips him&s;elf and goes into the water, (the water being low, di&s;covering the tops of &s;everal &s;harp-point|ed rocks), and gropes along with his &s;taff for &s;ure footing, wading as high as his chin, diving to the bottom frequently, and feel|ing about with his hands. This he conti|nued doing for almo&s;t two hours, but to no purpo&s;e, not daring to go out of his depth; for he well knew that he could do little good there, becau&s;e he could di&s;cover no part of the &s;hip, not &s;o much as the ma&s;t, or any of the rigging, but fancied &s;he lay in &s;ome deep hole, where it was impo&s;&s;ible to get at her.</P>

Thus de&s;pairing, and fretting and teaz|ing him&s;elf, he calls to mind that he had a hatchet in his hand when he was ca&s;t away, and thought probably it might lie in that clift of the rock into which he was thrown; thither he went, and looking about, per|ceived &s;omething like the handle of a hat|chet, ju&s;t above the &s;urface of the water, at the bottom of the rock; and going down to it, took it up; which, to his great joy, proved to be the very thing he wanted.</P>
<P>Having got his tool, he dre&s;&s;es him&s;elf, and goes on to the i&s;land again, intending to cut down &s;ome trees to make him&s;elf a hut; looking about, therefore, for the pro|pere&s;t plants, and taking notice of a &s;ort of trees, who&s;e branches, bending to the ground, took root, and became a plant, he thought they might be the fitte&s;t for this purpo&s;e, and cut a &s;ufficient parcel of them to make his barrack; which was full bu&s;i|ne&s;s for him that day.</P>
<P>The next morning, having paid his u&s;ual devotion, he walks out again to look for a plea&s;ant and convenient place to make his hut or barrack upon. He walked &s;everal hours, and could find none more &s;heltered from the cold winds than that where he al|ready lay, being in the middle of the i&s;land, well fenced on the north and ea&s;t &s;ides with trees, which &s;tood very thick. The place being fixed upon, he hews down &s;ome trees that grew in his way, and clears a &s;pot of ground about twelve feet &s;quare, leaving one tree &s;tanding at each corner; and, with
<PB N="107" REF="030190_0112_0FE5058699AC28A8">
the young plants he provided the day be|fore, filled the di&s;tance between quite round, &s;etting them about &s;ix inches a&s;un|der, leaving a larger vacancy for the door. His inclo&s;ure being made, he bends the branches at the top from both &s;ides, and weaves them acro&s;s one another, making a cover to it, which being &s;omething too thin, he laid other branches over, till they were grown thicker. Having fini&s;hed the top, he goes about clo&s;ing the &s;ides; for which purpo&s;e, taking large branches, he &s;trips off their &s;mall twigs, and weaves them between the plants as they do for &s;heep-pens, then made a door after the &s;ame manner.</P>

<P>His barrack being fini&s;hed, which took him up fifteen days hard work, "Now," &s;aid he, <Q>here is a hou&s;e, but where is the

furniture? This, indeed, may keep the weather from me, but not the cold. The ground on which I do and mu&s;t lie, is hard, and, doubtle&s;s, in the winter, will grow damp, which, with want of cov|ering, may occa&s;ion agues and fevers, the cholic and rheumati&s;m, and twenty racking di&s;tempers, which may cau&s;e me to repent my having e&s;caped a milder death.</Q></P>
<P>In this great con&s;ternation and perplexi|ty, he goes to &s;ee if he could &s;py any &s;hip|ping riding within &s;ight of the i&s;land. As he was walking along, full of heavy and dull thoughts, which weighed his looks to the ground, he happened to find a &s;ort of high gra&s;s, that grows but here and there, round &s;ome particular &s;ort of trees, of which he never took notice before. <Q>Hea|ven be prai&s;ed! &s;aid he, I have found wherewithal to keep my poor body from the ground, whil&s;t I am, by Providence, doomed to remain here.</Q> So pa&s;&s;es on, intending at his return to cut down a &s;uffi|cient quantity of it to make mats that might &s;erve him in&s;tead of bed and bed-cloaths.</P>
<P>Having looked him&s;elf almo&s;t blind, with|out &s;eeing the lea&s;t pro&s;pect of what he de|&s;ired, he concludes upon going to cut the gra&s;s which he &s;tood in &s;uch want of, and &s;pread it to dry, whil&s;t the weather was yet warm. That piece of work kept him employed the remainder of the day, and be&s;t part of the &s;ucceeding, having nothing but a pocket-knife to cut withal. That work
<PB N="109" REF="030190_0114_0FE5058F0FEDD5C8">
being done, wanting a tool to &s;pread and turn his gra&s;s, he takes a branch off the next tree, which, having &s;tript of all the &s;mall ones about it, all but part of that at the top, made a tolerable fork. Thus, be|ing equipt for hay-making, he went on with his work; and as he was at it, he &s;aw, at &s;ome di&s;tance, &s;everal monkeys as bu&s;y as him&s;elf, &s;cratching &s;omething out of the ground, which they eat in part upon the &s;pot, and carried the re&s;t to their home.</P>
<P>His hopes that tho&s;e roots might be for his u&s;e, tho&s;e creatures being naturally dainty, eating nothing but what men may, made him ha&s;ten to the place he &s;aw them &s;cratching at, that by the herb they they bear (which they tore off), he might find out the root.</P>
<P>Having, by the leaves which he picked off the ground, found &s;ome of the &s;ame, he digs them up, and carried them to his barrack; where he broiled a &s;lice of fi&s;h, and in the a&s;hes roa&s;ted them, which cat &s;omething like che&s;nuts, done in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>This new found-out eatable much rejoic|ed him. He returned his hearty thanks to kind Providence, that had put him in a way to provide him&s;elf with bread, and that of a mo&s;t delicious kind. As &s;oon, therefore, as he had dined, he went out on purpo&s;e to dig up a good quantity: but, as he was go|ing to the place where he had taken notice they grew pretty thick, he &s;ees a tortoi&s;e, of about a foot over, crawling before him:
<PB N="110" REF="030190_0115_0FE50594654317D0">
"Heaven be prai&s;ed!" &s;aid he, <Q>here is what will &s;upply me both with victuals and uten&s;ils to dre&s;s it in.</Q> He ran, there|fore, and turned it on its back, to keep it from getting away, whil&s;t he went for his hatchet, that he might cut the bottom &s;hell from the top, in order to make a kettle of the deepe&s;t, and a di&s;h of the flat part.</P>
<P>Being tired of cod-fi&s;h, he dre&s;&s;es the tor|toi&s;e, an animal &s;eldom eaten but upon ex|tremity, the fle&s;h thereof often giving the flux: neverthele&s;s, he ventured upon it, and liked it extremely, &s;ome part of it eat|ing very much like veal; which at that time was a very great novelty to him, having eaten no fre&s;h meat for a long time before.</P>
<P>Happening to eat of that part of the tor|toi&s;e which is the mo&s;t &s;eeding and lea&s;t hurtful, he was in no wi&s;e di&s;compo&s;ed; but having boiled it all, he laid by the re|mainder, to eat now and then between his fi&s;h.</P>
<P>Being provided with a boiling uten&s;il, he often had change, by means of tho&s;e admi|rable roots &s;o lucikly di&s;covered; &s;ome of which he roa&s;ted for bread, others he boiled with &s;altcod. This, in a great mea&s;ure, miti|gated his misfortune, and &s;oftened the hard|&s;hip he lay under; &s;o that, &s;eeing but little pro&s;pect of changing his pre&s;ent condition, by getting away from thence yet a while, he thinks on means to make it as ea&s;y as po&s;&s;i|ble whil&s;t he remained in it; for, having projected a bed, and taking the gra&s;s, which by that time was dry, he falls to work; and
<PB N="111" REF="030190_0116_0FE50595F07741D0">
a mat being the thing concluded upon, he twi&s;ts his hay into ropes, the bigne&s;s of his leg; then he cuts a pretty number of &s;ticks, about two feet long, which he drives into the ground, ten in a row, and near four inches a&s;under, and oppo&s;ite to them &s;uch another row at &s;ix or &s;even feet di&s;tance from the fir&s;t, which made the length of his mat; then having fa&s;tened one end of his rope to one of the corner &s;ticks, he brings it round the other corner &s;tick, and &s;o to the next at the other end, till he has laid his frame; then he weaves acro&s;s &s;horter ropes of the &s;ame, in the manner they make pallions on board &s;hips with old cable ends. When he had fini&s;hed his mat, he beat it with a long &s;tick, which made it &s;well up; and the gra&s;s being of a &s;oft cottony nature, he had a warm and ea&s;y bed to lie on.</P>
<P>The comfort and plea&s;ure he found on his &s;oft mat (being grown &s;ore with lying on the ground for a &s;pace of a month or more) &s;o liberally gratified him for the time and labour he had be&s;towed in making it, that it gave him encouragement to go about ano|ther, a covering being the next nece&s;&s;ary wanted; for though the weather was as yet pretty warm, and he in a great mea&s;ure &s;ea|&s;oned by the hard&s;hip he had gone through; yet the winter approaching, and the pre&s;ent &s;ea&s;on being &s;till favourable for him to make provi&s;ion again&s;t it, he goes and cuts more gra&s;s, which being made ready for u&s;e, he lengthens his loom, to allow for rolling up at one end, in&s;tead of a bol&s;ter, and makes
<PB N="112" REF="030190_0117_0FE5059953619BE0">
it thicker than the fir&s;t, which he intends, in cold weather, &s;hall lie upon him in&s;tead of blankets.</P>
<P>Being provided with the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary furniture he wanted, he thinks on more conveniences, re&s;olving to make him&s;elf a table to eat his victuals upon, and a chair to &s;it on. Thus, having cut &s;everal &s;ticks a|bout four feet long, he drives them in a row a little way in the ground, then takes &s;maller, which he interweaves between; having made the top, he &s;ets it upon four other &s;ticks, forky at the upper end, which he &s;tuck in the ground at one &s;ide of his bar|rack, to the height of a table: this being done, he cuts four more branches, &s;uch as he judged would do be&s;t for the &s;eat and back of a chair, which he al&s;o drove in the ground near his table; and having twi&s;ted the branches, which grew to them, with each other, from back to front, and acro&s;s again, he weaves &s;maller between, bottom|ing his &s;eat; which completes the furniture of his habitation.</P>
<P>That care being over, another &s;ucceeds, of a far greater moment: <Q>Here is a dwell|ing, &s;aid he, to &s;helter me from the weather, and a bed to re&s;t this poor body of mine; but where is food to &s;up|port it? Here I have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted near one month upon a fi&s;h, which the &s;ame dread|ful &s;torm, that took away forty lives, &s;ent me to maintain my own. Well, &s;ince kind Providence has been plea&s;ed to pre|&s;erve my life preferable to &s;o many, who
<PB N="113" REF="030190_0118_0FE505A453E308B0">
fatally peri&s;hed in that di&s;mal accident, I am bound, in gratitude, to hold it precious; and &s;ince my fi&s;h is almo&s;t gone, and I am not certain of more, I mu&s;t by degrees bring my&s;elf to live upon roots, which I hope will never be wanting, be|ing the natural product of this i&s;land: &s;o I mu&s;t eat of the &s;mall remnant of my fi&s;h but now and then, to make it hold out the longer. Dainties or plenty were not allotted for him that was doom|ed to &s;lavery, but labour and hard living; and, if I meet here the latter, Heaven be prai&s;ed, I have e&s;caped the wor&s;e; I can take my re&s;t, and &s;tand in no dread of any &s;evere in&s;pector or ta&s;kma&s;ter.</Q></P>
<P>Now being entirely reconciled to the &s;tate of life, Providence, on whom he fully de|pended, had been plea&s;ed to call him to, he re&s;olves to make provi&s;ion of tho&s;e ex|cellent roots; and with his hatchet he cuts a piece of a tree, wherewith he makes a &s;hovel, in order to dig them up with more ca&s;e: with this in&s;trument he went to the place where he ob&s;erved they grew thick|e&s;t, which being near the monkeys' quar|ters, they came down from off their trees in great numbers, grinning as if they would have flown at him; which made him &s;top awhile. He might, indeed, with the in|&s;trument in his hand, have killed &s;everal, and perhaps di&s;per&s;ed the re&s;t; but would not: "Why," &s;aid he, "&s;hould I add bar|barity to inju&s;tice? It is but natural and rea&s;onable for all creatures to guard and
<PB N="114" REF="030190_0119_0FE505A624754468">
defend their own: this was given them by nature for food, which I am come to rob them of: and &s;ince I am obliged to get of them for my &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, if I am decreed to be here another &s;ea&s;on, I will &s;et &s;ome in a place di&s;tant from theirs for my own u&s;e."</P>
<P>Having &s;tood &s;till a con&s;iderable time, tho&s;e animals, &s;eeing he did not go forwards, each went and &s;cratched up for it&s;elf, after|wards retiring; giving him the opportunity to dig up a few for him&s;elf: and as he was not come to the place where they grew thick, he laid them in &s;mall heaps as he dug them up; while tho&s;e &s;ly creatures would, whil&s;t he was digging up more, come down from the trees where they &s;tood hid among the leaves, and &s;teal them away; which obliged him to be contented for that time with as many as his pockets would hold, re&s;olving to bring &s;omething next time which would contain a larger quantity; and fearing tho&s;e animals, which are naturally very cunning, &s;hould dig them up, and hide them, he comes early the morning follow|ing to make his provi&s;ion; and for want of a &s;ack to put them in, he takes his jacket, which he buttons up, and ties at the &s;leeves; and as he had ob&s;erved, that every root had abundance of little off-&s;ets hanging at it by &s;mall fibres, he pulled off his &s;hirt al&s;o, of which he makes another &s;ack, to put them in.</P>
<P>Being naked, all but his breeches, and the day being pretty hot, he thought he had as good pull them off too, and fill them, his
<PB N="115" REF="030190_0120_0FE505A7B1D22298">
jacket being but &s;hort, and therefore hold|ing but few; taking, therefore, his bundle in one arm, and having the &s;hovel in the o|ther hand, he goes to the place he intended to go the day before; and expecting to find the &s;ame oppo&s;ition as he did then, he brought with him &s;ome of the roots he had dug up the preceding day, in order to throw them among&s;t tho&s;e animals, and &s;o quiet them; but to his great wonder, and as great &s;atis|faction, tho&s;e creatures, which the time before had oppo&s;ed him with noi&s;e and of|fen&s;ive motions, let him now pa&s;s by quiet|ly, without offering to meddle with any when dug up, though he had laid them up by heaps in their way, and &s;tood at a con|&s;iderable di&s;tance from them.</P>
<P>This &s;urpri&s;ing reverence from tho&s;e creatures &s;et him upon deep reflexions on what could be the cau&s;e thereof; whether it might not proceed from the proximity of their &s;hape and his: "but, then," &s;aid he, "my &s;tature and colour of &s;kin is &s;o different from theirs, that they cannot but di&s;tingui&s;h I am not of their kind: no, it mu&s;t be a remnant of that awe, entailed by Nature upon all animals, to that mo&s;t noble and complete ma&s;ter-piece of the creation, call|ed Man, which, now appearing in the &s;tate he was fir&s;t created in, and undi&s;gui&s;ed by cloaths, renews an image of that re&s;pect he has forfeited by his fatal tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, which ever &s;ince obliged him to hide the beauty of his fabric under a gaudy di&s;gui&s;e, which often renders him ridiculous to the re&s;t of
<PB N="116" REF="030190_0121_0FE505A94257CAE0">
mankind, and generally obnoxious to all other creatures; making a pride of what he ought to be a&s;hamed of. Well, adds he, &s;ince my cloaths bred the antipathy, I will remove that cau&s;e, which will &s;uit both the nature of tho&s;e animals, and my own circum&s;tances." From that time he re|&s;olves to go naked, till the hardne&s;s of the weather obliged him to put &s;omething on.</P>
<P>Having picked up a &s;ufficient quantity of off-&s;ets to &s;tock about two acres of land, he returns home, leaving behind him a con&s;i|derable quantity of roots dug up for tho&s;e poor animals, who attended him all the time he was at work, without offering to touch one till he was gone.</P>
<P>Being come home, he fixes upon a &s;pot of ground near his habitation, and digs it up as well as he could with his wooden in|&s;trument, in order to &s;ow his &s;eed; which having compa&s;&s;ed in about twenty days, he implores a ble&s;&s;ing upon his labour, and leaves it to time to bring it forth. Thus having fini&s;hed the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary work about his barrack, he re&s;olves to take a more particular view of the i&s;land, which till then he had not time to do; and take|ing a long &s;taff in his hand, he walks to the lake, which parts the land from the rock, and goes along the &s;ide of it quite round the i&s;land, finding all the way new &s;ubjects of admiration: on the left hand &s;tood a rampart made of one &s;olid &s;tone, adorned by nature with various forms and &s;hapes, beyond the power of art to imi|tate;
<PB N="117" REF="030190_0122_0FE505B560888D60">
&s;ome parts challenging a likene&s;s to a city, and clu&s;ters of hou&s;es, with here and there a high &s;teeple &s;tanding above the other buildings: another place claiming a near re&s;emblance to a di&s;tant fleet of &s;hip|ping, with their re&s;pective &s;ignals flying, coming into port: farther, it bears compari|&s;on with the dull remains of &s;ome &s;umptu|ous edifice, ruined by the often repeat|ed &s;hocks of time, inciting the beholders to condolence for the lo&s;s of its former beauty. At &s;ome di&s;tance from thence the pro&s;pect of a demoli&s;hed city is repre&s;ent|ed to the &s;ight: in another place large &s;tones, like &s;mall mountains, laid as it were, a-top of one another, impre&s;s the mind with an idea of the tower of Babel; and on the right hand a mo&s;t plea&s;ant land, covered with beautiful green gra&s;s, like chamomile, and here and there a clu&s;ter of trees, compo&s;ing mo&s;t agreeable groves, among&s;t a va&s;t number of fine lofty trees, of divers heights and &s;hapes, which &s;tood more di&s;tant, who&s;e irregularity added to the delightfulne&s;s of the place.</P>
<P>As he was walking on, admiring all the&s;e wonderful works of nature, having caught cold (not being u&s;ed to go naked), he hap|pened to &s;neeze oppo&s;ite to a place in the rock, which hollowed in after the manner of the in&s;ide of &s;ome cathedral, and was an&s;wered by a multitude of different voices i&s;&s;uing from that place. The agreeable|ne&s;s of the &s;urpri&s;e induced him to rou&s;e tho&s;e echoes a &s;econd time, by giving a
<PB N="118" REF="030190_0123_0FE505B925496900">
loud hem; which was, like his &s;neezing, repeated in different tones, but all very harmonious; again he hem'd, and was &s;o delighted with the repetition, that he could have &s;pent hours in the hearing of it. <Q>But why &s;hould I, &s;aid he, wa&s;te tho&s;e melodious &s;ounds, &s;o &s;it to relate the Al|mighty's wonderful works, and &s;et forth his prai&s;e?</Q> Immediately he &s;ang &s;everal p&s;alms and hymns with as much emulation and devotion, as if he had been in company with numbers of &s;kilful and celebrated cho|ri&s;ters.</P>
<P>Having &s;pent a con&s;iderable time there with much plea&s;ure, he proceeds in his walk, being re&s;olved to make that his place of wor&s;hip for the future, and attend it twice a day con&s;tantly.</P>
<P>About three or four hundred paces far|ther, having turned on the other &s;ide of a jetting out part of the rock, he was &s;topt a &s;econd time by another &s;urpri&s;ing product of nature; a large &s;tone, growing out of the rock, advancing quite over the lake at the bottom of it, repre&s;enting &s;omething of a human &s;hape, out of the brea&s;t whereof i&s;&s;ued a fountain of exceeding clear water, as &s;weet as milk; and, when looked at fronting, was like an antique piece of arch|itecture, which in old times they built over particular &s;prings; and on the other &s;ide appeared as if &s;pringing from the no&s;trils of a &s;ea hor&s;e. The&s;e three &s;o very different and yet rightly compared likene&s;&s;es, being offered by one and the &s;ame unaltered ob|ject,
<PB N="119" REF="030190_0124_0FE505BAB50303B0">
made him curious to examine what parts of every re&s;emblance helped to make the others; and having &s;pent a con&s;iderable time in the examination, he found every thing, which the front had likene&s;s of, was employed in making the &s;ide repre&s;entation, by being in &s;ome places &s;hortened, and o|thers lengthened, according to the point of &s;ight.</P>
<P>Being &s;atisfied about that &s;ubject, he en|ters upon another as puzzling: the ba&s;on in which the fountain ran, which was about five yards di&s;tant from whence the water did &s;pring, being but about nine feet over every way, without any vi&s;ible place to evacuate its over complement, and yet keeping the &s;ame height, without da&s;hing or running over, although the &s;tream that fell into it ran as big as his wri&s;t. Having a long time &s;earched into the cau&s;e, without any &s;atisfaction, he conjectures it mu&s;t make its way out &s;omewhere under ground; &s;o went on, till he came to the place he had begun his march at, which ended that day's work.</P>
<P>Having been round the i&s;land, which, to the be&s;t of his judgment. was about ten or eleven miles in circumference, of an oblong form, going in and out in &s;everal places, extending from north to &s;outh, the &s;outh end near twice as broad as the oppo&s;ite; he re&s;olves to employ the next day in viewing the in&s;ide.</P>
<P>So the next morning he walks along the land, which he found very level, covered
<PB N="120" REF="030190_0125_0FE5070F06DAE9D0">
with a delightful green gra&s;s, and adorned with trees of divers &s;orts, &s;hapes and height, inhabited with &s;everal &s;orts of curious &s;ing|ing birds, of various colours and notes, which entertained him with their melodi|ous harmony. In &s;ome places &s;tood a clu&s;|ter of trees, compo&s;ing agreeable and de|lightful groves, proceeding from only one main body, who&s;e lower branches, being come to a certain length, applied to the earth for immediate nouri&s;hment, as it were, to ea&s;e the old &s;tem that produced them; and &s;o became a plant, and did the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Having for &s;ome time admired the agree|ablene&s;s and curio&s;ity of the plant, by which nature &s;eemed to give human kind in&s;truc|tions; and looking about, if perchance he could find any thing in his way for his own proper u&s;e, he took along with him a &s;am|ple of every different herb he thought might be eatable. Cro&s;&s;ing the i&s;land in &s;everal places, he comes at a mo&s;t delightful pond, about two hundred yards in length, and one hundred and fifty wide, with fine trees &s;preading their branchy limbs over its brink, which was &s;urrounded with a beautiful bank, covered with divers kinds of flowers and herbs, &s;o naturally intermixed, which com|pleted it in ornament and conveniency, as though intended by nature for more than mortal's u&s;e.</P>
<P>Having walked &s;everal times round it with much plea&s;ure, he &s;at down a while upon its bank, to admire the clearne&s;s of the wa|ter, through which, to his great comfort,

<P>Being &s;ufficiently diverted with their cha&s;ing one another, which were of many beautiful and different colours, and a mo&s;t delightful &s;cene, he proceeds in his walk, and goes to the &s;outh of the i&s;land, where he finds another &s;ubject of admiration, a noble and &s;pacious wood, who&s;e &s;hades &s;eemed to be made for the abode of peace and plea&s;ure. He walked round it with much delight, which made the time &s;eem &s;hort; yet he could gue&s;s it to be no le&s;s than two miles about.</P>
<P>Having viewed the out&s;ide, who&s;e extraor|dinary agreeablene&s;s incited in him an un&s;ur|mountable de&s;ire to get into it, but where he was afraid to venture, le&s;t there might be de|&s;tructive creatures; yet, having recommended him&s;elf to the care of Providence, he ventured into it, finding &s;everal plea&s;ant walks, &s;ome &s;traight, edged with lofty trees, as though plant|ed for plea&s;ure; others crooked and winding, bordered with a thick hedge of pimentoes, which ca&s;t a mo&s;t fragrant &s;mell; here and there a large clu&s;ter of bu&s;hes and dwarf trees, wherein &s;heltered &s;everal different kinds of wild bea&s;ts and fowls: <Q>Sure, &s;aid he, this i&s;land never was intended by nature to lie wa&s;te, but rather re&s;erved to be the happy abode of &s;ome, for whom Heaven had a pe|culiar ble&s;&s;ing in &s;tore.

<P>Being hungry, and tired with walking, he goes home in order to get &s;ome victuals, and having made a fire, he boils a &s;lice of his &s;alt fi&s;h with &s;ome roots, and then the herbs he brought with him, which proved of divers ta&s;tes, and all excellent; &s;ome eating like artichoaks, others like a&s;paragus and &s;pinach. <Q>Now, &s;aid he, what can I wi&s;h for more! Here I po&s;&s;e&s;s a plentiful land, which pro|duces both fle&s;h and fi&s;h; bears excellent greens and roots, and affords the be&s;t of wa|ter, which by nature was ordained for man's drink. Pomp and greatne&s;s are but pagean|try, which oftentimes prove more prejudicial to the actor, than diverting to the beholder; ea&s;e and indulgence are apt to breed the gout, and various di&s;tempers, which make the rich more wretched than the poor; now the&s;e evils, thanks to my Maker! I &s;tand in no danger of, having but what is &s;ufficient, which never can do any harm.</Q></P>
<P>Thus thoroughly ea&s;y in his mind, he pro|po&s;es to &s;pend the afternoon at the out&s;ide of the rock, in viewing the &s;ea, and looking for oy&s;ters; &s;o takes in his hand his long &s;taff to grapple in holes; and his breeches which he ties at the knees, to bring them in. Being come to a place of the rock he had never been at be|fore, he &s;ees at a di&s;tance &s;omething like linen hanging upon it, which, when he come at, he found to be the main-&s;ail of a &s;hip, with a piece of the yard fa&s;tened to it: "Alas!" &s;aid

Happy is he who limits his de&s;ires to his ability, a&s;piring not above his reach, and is contented with what nature requires.</Q> Then he falls a ripping the &s;heet from the yard, which he finds in one place tied with one of his garters, (having him&s;elf made u&s;e of it for want of another &s;tring) <Q>Heaven be prai&s;ed! &s;aid he, this is no effect of another &s;hipwreck, but a fragment of the unfortunate &s;hip, who&s;e lo&s;s was my redemption;</Q> which reflexion made him &s;hed tears.</P>
<P>Having ripped the &s;ail in pieces, he rolls them in &s;uch bundles as he could conveniently carry, and lays them down till he had got a few oy&s;ters, proceeding to grope in holes with his &s;tick as he went on.</P>
<P>About forty paces farther, he finds a che&s;t in the clift of a rock, which had been wa&s;hed up there by the violence of the late &s;torm:&mdash;<Q>Heaven! &s;aid he, more fatal effects of fate's cruelty and man's temerity!

Having taken as much of the &s;ail cloth as he could conveniently carry, with the few oy&s;ters he had got, he went home and fetched the tool, wherewith he wrenched the che&s;t open, from which he took a &s;uit of cloaths and &s;ome wearing linen: "The&s;e," &s;aid he, "neither the owner nor I want;" &s;o laid them down; the next thing he took out was a roll of &s;everal &s;heets of parchment, being blank indentures and lea&s;es: <Q>The&s;e, &s;aid he, are in&s;truments of the law, and often applied to inju&s;tice; but I'll alter their mi&s;|chievous properties, and make them records of Heaven's mercies, and Providence's won|derful liberality to me; &s;o, in&s;tead of being the ruin of &s;ome, they may chance to be the reclaiming of others.</Q> At the bottom of the che&s;t lay a runlet of brandy, a Che&s;hire chee&s;e, a leather bottle full of ink, with a parcel of pens, and a penknife: <Q>As for the&s;e, &s;aid he, they are of u&s;e; the pens, ink, and parchment have equipped me to keep a jour|nal, which will divert and pa&s;s away a few anxious hours: as for the chee&s;e and brandy, they will but cau&s;e me new cares: before I had them, I wanted them not: now, the be|nefit and comfort I &s;hall find in them, when gone, will make me hanker after them more, I wi&s;h I had &s;till been without them; but now

<P>So, by degrees, he takes home the che&s;t, and what was in it; and now having materials to begin his journal, he immediately fell to work, that for want of other books, he might, at his lei&s;ure, peru&s;e his pa&s;t tran&s;actions, and the many mercies he had received from Heaven; and that, after his decea&s;e, whoever is directed thither by Providence, upon reading his won|derful e&s;capes in the greate&s;t of dangers; his miraculous living, when remote from human a&s;&s;i&s;tance; in the extremity, might not de&s;pair. Thus he begins from his being eight years old (as well as he can remember, he heard an old aunt of his &s;ay) to the day of his being ca&s;t

away, being then twenty-eight years of age, re&s;olving to continue it to his death.</P>
<P>He now re&s;olves to make provi&s;ion again&s;t winter, and the &s;ea&s;on being pretty far advanced, he gathers a good &s;tore of fuel and roots; be|gins to line the out&s;ide of his barrack with a wall of turf, and lays the &s;ame at top, to keep out the wet. And as he now and then found &s;mall &s;hell-fi&s;h and oy&s;ters upon the rock, he makes a bridge over the lake, which in warm weather he u&s;ed to wade, that in the winter he might go over dry. So, having completed his bridge, which was made of two &s;trong poles, which reached from the land to the rock, and &s;e|veral le&s;&s;er-branches laid acro&s;s pretty clo&s;e, he retires home, the day being far &s;pent. The following night there aro&s;e a violent &s;torm, at|tended with dreadful claps of thunder, which the many echoes from the rock rendered more terrible; and lightnings fla&s;hing in a mo&s;t frightful manner, &s;ucceeding each other, be|fore the preceding was well out of the &s;ky, which put poor lone&s;ome Quarll in &s;uch a con|&s;ternation, that notwith&s;tanding his reliance on Heaven's protection, he would have given the world (had it been in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion) to have been within the reach of human a&s;&s;i&s;tance; or at lea&s;t to have had &s;ome company; &s;olitude adding much to his terror and affliction.</P>
<P>The glorious ri&s;ing of the next morning's &s;un having laid the mortifying rage of the blu&s;ter|ing winds, Quarll, who&s;e late alarm was hardly quelled, &s;till &s;u&s;pecting its mo&s;t reviving rays to be terrifying glances and fla&s;hes of lightning; but having lain awhile, and hearing no noi&s;e,

<P>Being come at the other &s;ide of the rock, he &s;aw indeed &s;urpri&s;ing objects, but not afflicting; the mi&s;chief that was done, being to the inha|bitants of the &s;ea only, a va&s;t number of which had, by the wind, been di&s;elemented; a quan|tity of &s;tately whitings, fine mackerels, large herrings, divers &s;izes of codlings, and &s;everal other &s;orts of fi&s;h, with a great number of &s;hells, of different &s;hapes and bigne&s;&s;es, lying up and down upon the rock. <Q>Heaven be prai&s;ed! &s;aid he, in&s;tead of damage to bewail, what thanks have I now to return for this mighty benefit! Here the powerful agent of mi&s;chief is, by kind Providence, made a mini&s;ter of good to me: make me thankful!

<P>Thus having taken up as many fi&s;h as he could hold in his arms, he carries them home, and brings his &s;hirt, which he u&s;ed in&s;tead of a &s;ack; &s;o, at &s;everal times, he brought away all the fi&s;h, and as many of the &s;hells as he had oc|ca&s;ion for; of &s;ome of which he made boilers and &s;tewpans; of others, di&s;hes and plates; &s;ome he kept water in, and others fi&s;h in pickle; &s;o that he was &s;tocked with nece&s;&s;ary ve&s;&s;els as well as provi&s;ion.</P>

down to re&s;t him&s;elf; and the runlet of brandy lying by, he was tempted to take a &s;up, which was at that time very much wanted, his &s;pirits being very low; but was loth to ta&s;te it, le&s;t he &s;hould grow fond of the liquor, and grieve after it when gone: &s;ome moments were &s;pent before he could come to a re&s;olution; at la&s;t, having con&s;idered the u&s;e of it, which &s;uited the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, he concludes to take a dram, and to u&s;e it like a cordial, which it was fir&s;t intended for; but the ve&s;&s;el out of which he drank, being at his mouth, the cordial turns to a nectar; one gulph decoys another down; &s;o the intended dram became a hearty draught. The plea&s;antne&s;s of the liquor made him forget its nature; &s;o that poor Quarll, who had, for the &s;pace of near three months before, drank nothing but water, was pre&s;ently overcome with the &s;trength of the brandy, and fell a&s;leep in his chair, with the runlet on his bare lap, from whence it &s;oon fell to the ground, and, being un&s;topt, ran all out.</P>

But why &s;hould I lay the blame upon the u&s;e, when it is the abu&s;e that does the hurt? and exclaim again&s;t a thing, which being taken in moderation is of &s;o great a benefit, reviving a fainting heart, rai&s;ing &s;inking &s;pirits, warming cold and de|cayed nature, and a&s;&s;uaging &s;everal pains.</Q> So blames him&s;elf highly for gratifying his ap|petite with that wherewith he only ought to have refre&s;hed nature; and &s;ince that often mi&s;guided faculty had prompted him to com|mit the fault, he dedicated that day, in which he became &s;en&s;ible of it, to prayers and fa&s;ting; and every &s;eventh from that he &s;ets apart for divine wor&s;hip only, which he hoped would keep him from breaking the commandments for keeping holy the &s;abbath day: &s;o went to the place where the echoes, in many different and melodious &s;ounds, repeated his thank&s;giv|ing to the Almighty, which he had fixed upon to pay his devotion, and there &s;pent the re&s;t of the day in prayers and &s;inging of p&s;alms.</P>

the fair weather, to dry one part of the re|mainder, and keeps the re&s;t in pickle.</P>
<P>The winter being neat at hand, and the weather growing damp and cold, hinders him from taking his walks; &s;o being confined with|in doors, he employs his idle hours in beauti|fying his uten&s;ils, which were not to be u&s;ed on the fire; and be&s;towed &s;ome pains in &s;crap|ing and poli&s;hing the re&s;t of his &s;hells, &s;ome as fine as though they had been nakers of pearl; which made them not only more fit for their intended u&s;es, but al&s;o a great ornament to his barrack, which he &s;helved round with plaited twigs after the manner of his table, and &s;o &s;et them upon it.</P>
<P>Thus he &s;pent the be&s;t part of the winter, making no farther remarks, but that it was very &s;harp, attended with high winds, abun|dance of nail and &s;now, which obliged him to make a broom to &s;weep it away from about his hut, which otherwi&s;e would have been damaged by it.</P>
<P>But &s;hivering Winter having exhau&s;ted his fro&s;ty &s;tores, and weary with vexing nature, re|tired; Boreas al&s;o, grown faint with hard blow|ing, is forced to retreat into his cave; gentle Zephyrus (who till then kept up in his tem|perate cell) now comes forth to u&s;her in the blooming &s;pring; &s;o mildly &s;lips on to inform Nature of her favourite's approach, who at the joyful news puts on her gay enamelled garb, and out of her rich wardrobe &s;upplies all vege|tables with new ve&s;ture, to welcome the lovely gue&s;t.

So, having returned Heaven thanks for his happy &s;tate, he creeps to the north-ea&s;t &s;ide of the rock, at the foot of which lay an extraor|dinary large whale, which the late high wind had ca&s;t there, and died for want of water. <Q>If this, &s;aid he, is all the damage that has been done la&s;t winter, it may be borne;</Q> &s;o went down and mea&s;ured the length of it, which was above thirty yards, and proportionable in bigne&s;s: there were &s;hoals of &s;mall fi&s;hes &s;wim|ming about it in the &s;hallow water wherein it lay, as rejoicing at its death. <Q>Thus, &s;aid he, the oppre&s;&s;ed rejoice at a tyrant's fall.

What u&s;e have I for any? Providence takes none, it gives me all gratis.</Q> So goes on feeling for oy&s;ters with his &s;taff, which he always walked with.</P>
<P>Having at la&s;t found a hole, where by their rattling at the bottom with his &s;taff, he judged there might be a pretty many, he marks the place, and goes home to contrive &s;ome in&s;tru|ment to drag them up, being yet too cold for him to go in the water; and as he had no tool

but his knife and hatchet, both improper to make a hole in a board, as requi&s;ite to make a rake, which was wanting for that purpo&s;e; he beats out the end of his che&s;t, in which there was a knot: &s;o having driven it out, he fa&s;tens the &s;mall end of a pole to it. Thus equipped, he went and raked up oy&s;ters, which added one di&s;h to his ordinary, and &s;auce to others; yet at length his &s;tomach growing qualmi&s;h with eating altogether fi&s;h, and drink|ing nothing but water withal, he wi&s;hes he could have a little fle&s;h, which he might ea&s;ily, there being animals enough in the wood apparently fit for food; but then he mu&s;t deprive them of their lives, barely to make his own more ea&s;y.</P>
<P>Thus he debates with him&s;elf for &s;ome time, whether or no it would not be inju&s;tice for him (who only by a providential accident was brought thither to &s;ave his life) now to de&s;troy tho&s;e creatures, to whom nature had given a being, in a land out of man's reach to di&s;turb: yet nature requires what &s;eems to be again&s;t na|ture for me to grant: I am faint, and like to grow wor&s;e, the longer I ab&s;tain from fle&s;h.</P>
<P>Having pau&s;ed a while; <Q>Why, &s;aid he, &s;hould I be &s;o &s;crupulous? Were not all things created for the u&s;e of man? Now, whether it is not wor&s;e to let a man peri&s;h, than to de&s;troy any other creature for his re|lief? Nature craves it, and Providence gives it: now, not to u&s;e it in nece&s;&s;ity, is under|valuing the gift.</Q></P>
<P>So, having concluded upon catching &s;ome of tho&s;e animals he had &s;een in the wood, he con|&s;iders by what means, having no dogs to hunt,
<PB N="134" REF="030190_0139_0FE506009FC98320">
nor guns to &s;hoot. Having pau&s;ed awhile, he re&s;olves upon making gins, wherewith he had &s;een hares catched in Europe: thus, taking &s;ome of the cords which he found with the &s;ail at the out&s;ide of the rock, he goes to work, and makes &s;everal, which he fa&s;tens at divers gaps in the thick&s;et, within the wood, through which he judged that &s;ort of bea&s;t, he had a mind for, went.</P>
<P>Impatient to know the &s;ucce&s;s of his &s;nares, he gets up betimes the next morning, and goes to examine them; in one he found a certain animal &s;omething like a fawn, the colour of a deer, but feet and ears like a fox, and as big as a well-grown hare. He was much rejoiced at his game, who&s;e mouth he immediately opened, to &s;ee if he could find out whether it fed upon gra&s;s, or lived upon prey: the crea|ture being caught by the neck, and &s;trangled with &s;truggling, before it died, had brought up in its throat &s;ome of the greens it had been eating, which very much plea&s;ed him; ac|counting tho&s;e which lived upon fle&s;h as bad as carrion.</P>
<P>Having returned thanks for his good luck, he takes it home in order to dre&s;s part of it for his dinner; &s;o ca&s;es and guts it: but it proving to be a female, big with three young ones, grieved him to the heart, and made him repent making tho&s;e killing noo&s;es. <Q>What pity, &s;aid he, &s;o many lives &s;hould be lo&s;t, and creatures wa&s;ted! One would have &s;erved me four days; and here are four killed at once. Well, henceforth, to prevent the like evil, I will take alive what I ju&s;t want and

&s;ave all the females.</Q> So, having &s;tuck a long &s;tick at both ends in the ground, making a half circle, he hangs one quarter of the ani|mal upon a &s;tring before a good fire, and &s;o roa&s;ts it.</P>
<P>His dinner being ready, having &s;aid grace, he &s;et to eating with an uncommon appetite; and, whether it was the novelty of the di&s;h, or that the meat did ju&s;tly de&s;erve the prai&s;e, he really thought he never eat any thing of fle&s;h, till then, comparable to it, either for ta&s;te or tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>Having dined both plentifully and deliciou&s;ly, he mo&s;t zealou&s;ly returns kind Providence thanks for the late, and all favours received; then pur&s;uant to his re&s;olution, he goes to making nets, in order to take his game alive for the future; and, as he had no &s;mall twine to make it with, he was obliged to unravel &s;ome of the &s;ail which he luckily had by him; and with the thread, twi&s;ted &s;ome of the bigne&s;s he judged proper for that u&s;e.</P>
<P>Having made a &s;ufficient quantity, he makes a couple of nets, about four feet &s;quare, which he fa&s;tens in the room of the killing &s;nares; &s;o retired, and re&s;olved to come and examine them every morning.</P>
<P>Several days pa&s;&s;ed without taking any thing, &s;o that he wanted fle&s;h for a whole week, which did begin to di&s;order his &s;tomach, but not his temper; being entirely re&s;igned to the will of Providence, and fully contented with whatever Heaven was plea&s;ed to &s;end.</P>
<P>One afternoon, which was not his cu&s;tomary time of day to examine his nets, being too vi|&s;ible
<PB N="136" REF="030190_0141_0FE5060540DA2B90">
in the day-time for game to run in; he happened to walk in the wood, to take the full dimen&s;ions thereof, &s;o chanced to go by his nets; in one of which were taken two animals, as big as a kid &s;ix weeks old, of a bright dun, their horns upright and &s;traight, their &s;hape like a &s;tag, mo&s;t curiou&s;ly limbed, a &s;mall tuft of hair on each &s;houlder and hip. By their horns, which were but &s;hort, they appeared to be very young, which rejoiced him the more, being in hopes to tame tho&s;e which he did not want for pre&s;ent u&s;e; &s;o carried them home joy|ful of his game, depending upon a good din|ner; but was &s;adly di&s;appointed: the animals he found were antelopes (calling to mind he had &s;een them in his travels,) which proving both females, he had made a re&s;olution to pre|&s;erve. Though they were too young to be with kid, and he in great need of fle&s;h, yet he would not kill them; &s;o with cords fa&s;tens them to the out&s;ide of his lodge; and with con&s;tant feeding them, in two months time made them &s;o tame, that they followed him up and down; which added much to the plea&s;ure he already, took in his habitation, which by that time was covered with green leaves, both top and &s;ides; the stakes it was made of having &s;truck root, and &s;hot out young branches, who&s;e &s;trength increa&s;ing that &s;ummer; to fill up the vacancy between each plant, he pulled the turfs, wherewith he had covered the out&s;ide and top of the hut between them, to keep the cold out in the winter.</P>
<P>His former hut, being now become a plea|&s;ant arbour, gave him encouragement to be|&s;tow
<PB N="137" REF="030190_0142_0FE50606E2E62888">
&s;ome pains about it towards the embelli&s;h|ment of it, which &s;eemed to depend on being well attended. He re&s;olved upon keeping it pruned and watered, the better to make it grow thick and fa&s;t, which an&s;wered his intent; for in three years time, the &s;tems of every plant that compo&s;ed the arbour, were grown quite clo&s;e, and made a &s;olid wall of about &s;ix inches thick, covered with green leaves without, which lay mo&s;t regular and even, and within had a mo&s;t agreeable &s;mooth bark, of a plea&s;ant olive colour.</P>
<P>His late arbour being, by his care and time, and nature's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, become a matchle&s;s lodge, as intended by nature for &s;omething more than human gue&s;ts, he now con&s;ults to make it as commodious as beautiful. <Q>Here is, &s;aid he, a delightful dwelling, warm in the winter, and cool in the &s;ummer; delight|ful to the eye, and comfortable to the body; pity it &s;hould be employed to any u&s;e, but repo&s;e and delight!</Q> So re&s;olved upon mak|ing a kitchen near it. Thus having fixed upon a place convenient at the &s;ide of his lodge, about &s;ix feet from it, twelve in length, and eight in breadth, which he inclo&s;ed with the turfs that covered the out&s;ide of his arbour, be|fore it was &s;ufficiently thick to keep out the cold; then having laid &s;ticks acro&s;s the top of the walls, which were about eight feet high, he lays turf thereon, and &s;o covers it, leaving an open place for the &s;moke to go out.</P>
<P>The out&s;ide being done, he goes about in|&s;ide nece&s;&s;aries, as fire-places to roa&s;t and boil at; thus cuts a hole in the ground, at a &s;mall
<PB N="138" REF="030190_0143_0FE5060F3A776C28">
di&s;tance from the wall, after the manner of &s;tew|&s;toves in noblemen's kitchens; then, at another place, he &s;ets two flat &s;tones, about eight or nine inches broad, and one foot long, edge|ways, oppo&s;ite to one another, near two feet a&s;under; then puts a third in the &s;ame manner, at the end of the other two; &s;o makes a fire|place fit to roa&s;t at: then, for other conveni|ences, he weaves twigs about &s;ticks, &s;tuck in the wall on one &s;ide of the kitchen, where he lays the &s;hells fit for uten&s;ils, which both adorn|ed and furni&s;hed it.</P>
<P>Having completed that piece of work, he goes and vi&s;its his plantations, which he finds in a thriving condition; the roots being, in &s;ix months time, grown from the bigne&s;s of a pea (as they were when fir&s;t &s;et) to that of an egg: his antelopes were al&s;o come to their full growth and complete beauty, which exceeded mo&s;t four footed bea&s;ts, having a maje&s;tic pre|&s;ence, body and limbs repre&s;enting a &s;tag, and the noble march of a hor&s;e: &s;o every thing concurred to his happine&s;s. For which having returned his mo&s;t liberal benefactor his grateful acknowledgements, he thinks on means to pre|vent any ob&s;tructions that may intercept the continuation thereof; and as the want of cloaths was the only cau&s;e he could think of to make him unea&s;y, having but the jacket and ho&s;e which were given him on board, to &s;ave his own cloaths, which when worn out he could not recruit; therefore, to accu&s;tom him&s;elf to go without, he le&s;&s;ens tho&s;e he had, and takes away the lining from the out&s;ide, in order to wear the thicke&s;t in the colde&s;t weather, and

&s;o thins his dre&s;s by degrees, till at la&s;t he went quite naked.</P>
<P>Having thus concluded, as being the be&s;t &s;hift nece&s;&s;ity could rai&s;e him, he falls to rip|ping his jacket, in the lining whereof he finds &s;even peas and three beans, which were got in at a hole at the corner of the pocket.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e few made him wi&s;h for more, which he had no room to hope for, they being rai&s;ed by &s;eed, which the i&s;land did not produce: <Q>The&s;e few, &s;aid he, which at pre&s;ent are hardly &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy a woman's longing, may, with time and indu&s;try, be improved to a quantity large enough to &s;erve me for a meal;</Q> then lays them up again&s;t a proper time to &s;et them; &s;o &s;pent the remainder of that &s;ummer in walking about the i&s;land, watering his lodge, weeding his root plantation, attend|ing his nets, which now and then &s;upplied him with an antelope or goat, to eat at intervals between fi&s;h he commonly found on the rock after high winds and &s;torms; never failing to vi&s;it the &s;ea three or four times a week, ac|cording as the weather did prove; thus divert|ing many anxious hours with the variety of ob|jects that element affords. Sometimes he had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing great whales cha&s;ing one another, &s;pouting large &s;treams of water out of their gills and no&s;trils; at other times, num|bers of beautiful dolphins rolling among&s;t the waves; now and then a quantity of &s;trange mon&s;trous fi&s;h playing on the &s;urface of the &s;ea, &s;ome whereof had heads (not common to fi&s;hes) like tho&s;e of hogs; others not unlike tho&s;e of dogs, calves, hor&s;es, lions, bulls,
<PB N="140" REF="030190_0145_0FE5061993E33790">
goats, and &s;everal other creatures: &s;ome cha&s;ing another &s;ort; which, to avoid being taken, would quit their element, and &s;eek refuge in the air, and fly &s;ome yards above the water; till their fins being dry, obliged them to plunge in again.</P>
<P>The&s;e pa&s;times being generally &s;ucceeded with bad weather, and dreadful &s;torms, checked the plea&s;ure they gave, with a dread of the evil that threatened to follow. Thus com|mi&s;erating the ca&s;e of tho&s;e who&s;e misfortune is to be expo&s;ed to them; having &s;pent &s;ome time in reflexion, he goes to his u&s;ual devotion, and calling to mind, that in all that time he never &s;aw a young fi&s;h in the pond, he con|jectured that &s;omething might de&s;troy the &s;mall ones; and as he imagined &s;o it proved: for at his approach, a large fowl flew out of the pond with a fi&s;h in its bill, being too large for it to &s;wallow.</P>
<P>At that di&s;tance, the bird being al&s;o upon the wing, he could neither di&s;cern colour nor make; but he had the &s;atisfaction of di&s;cover|ing the cau&s;e why the fi&s;hes did not increa&s;e, they being devoured when young by that crea|ture; which to prevent for the future, he &s;tudies means to kill the de&s;troyer; nets not being pro|per in&s;truments, it being requi&s;ite, for that purpo&s;e, to have one all round, as al&s;o to cover the pond, which was impo&s;&s;ible by rea&s;on of its largene&s;s; and a le&s;s being of no u&s;e, the birds probably not coming to one certain place. He wi&s;hed for a gun and ammunition fitting, as being the mo&s;t probable things to &s;ucceed; but no &s;uch in&s;trument being within his reach,
<PB N="141" REF="030190_0146_0FE5061B1E721140">
he ponders again; during which time, a cro&s;&s;|bow offers it&s;elf to his mind, but is as di&s;tant from his reach as the gun. It is true, there was &s;tuff enough in the i&s;land to make many, but no tools except a hatchet and pocket knife, wherewith, if he made &s;hift to cut and &s;hape a bow, he could not make a latch and &s;pring ne|ce&s;&s;ary to it; &s;o he mu&s;t not think on it: yet a bow being the only thing he could apply to, he goes about one forthwith. Thus having picked a branch of a tree, which had the re|&s;emblance of yew, and as tough, of which they are &s;ometimes made, he, with the tools he had, made a &s;hift to make one about &s;ix feet long, and arrows of the &s;ame, which he hardens and &s;traightens over the fire; then having &s;lit them at one end, about two or three inches, he &s;lips in a bit of parchment, cut &s;harp at one end, and about three inches at the other, then ties the end clo&s;e, to keep it in, which &s;erved for

feathers; and, with the ravelling of &s;ome of the &s;ail, he makes a &s;tring to it.</P>
<P>Thus equipped for an archer, wanting no|thing but &s;kill, which is only to be gained by practice, he daily exerci&s;es &s;hooting at a mark for the &s;pace of a fortnight; in which time he made &s;uch an improvement, that at three &s;hots he would hit a mark of about three inches &s;quare, at near fifty paces di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Being &s;ufficiently &s;killed, he goes and lies in wait for his de&s;ired game; &s;o placed him&s;elf behind a tree, as near the pond as he could, whither the bird came in a few hours after.</P>
<P>The creature being pitched upon the bank, never &s;tood &s;till, but kept running round, watching for a &s;izeable fi&s;h fit to &s;wallow; &s;o that he had no opportunity to &s;hoot; till having at la&s;t, e&s;pied out one, it launched it&s;elf into the pond, but ro&s;e more &s;lowly, which gave him time to take aim; neverthele&s;s, he mi&s;&s;ed it, being in motion; but when come to the top, he &s;truck it through the body as it opened its wings, and laid it flat on the other &s;ide of the pond. He took it up, wonderfully plea&s;ed at his good &s;ucce&s;s the fir&s;t time of his practi&s;ing his new acquired art; yet, having taken no|tice of the bird's beauty, he had a regret for its death, though he might, in time, have rued its living; the &s;tock of fi&s;h weekly decrea&s;ing, by his own catching one now and then with a &s;mall net he made for that u&s;e, when &s;hort of other provi&s;ions, and their recruiting prevented by that bird's daily devouring their young.</P>
<P>The inexpre&s;&s;ible beauty of the feathers, which were after the nature of a drake, every

one di&s;tingui&s;hed from another by a rim round the edge thereof, about the breadth of a large thread, and of a changeable colour from red to aurora and green; the ribs of a delightful blue, and the feathers pearl colour, &s;peckled with a bright yellow; the brea&s;t and belly (if it might be &s;aid to be of any particular colour) was that of a dove's feather rimmed like the back, diver&s;ly changing; the head, which was like that of a &s;wan for make, was purple al&s;o, changing as it moved; the bill like burni&s;hed gold; eyes like a ruby, with a rim of gold round it; the feet the &s;ame as the bill; the &s;ize of the bird was between a middling goo&s;e and a duck, and in &s;hape re&s;embling a &s;wan.</P>
<P>Having bemoaned the death of that delight|ful creature, he carefully takes out its fle&s;h, which, corrupting, would &s;poil the out&s;ide; then fills the &s;kin with &s;weet herbs, which he dried for that u&s;e; and having &s;ewed up the place he had cut open to take the fle&s;h out, he &s;et it up in his lodge.</P>
<P>His good &s;ucce&s;s in archery made him love the exerci&s;e; &s;o that what odd hours he had in the day (be&s;ides tho&s;e he &s;et apart for his divine wor&s;hip, and tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ary occupations about his lodge, plantations, and making remarks) he be&s;towed in &s;hooting at the mark, which in time made him &s;o expert, that he hardly would mi&s;s a &s;tanding mark the bigne&s;s of a dove, at forty or fifty yards di&s;tance, once in ten times; and would &s;hoot tolerably well flying, having once occa&s;ion to try it upon a mon&s;trous eagle, which often flew round over the place where his antelopes and goats fed, near his lodge,
<PB N="144" REF="030190_0149_0FE50628E0F37C60">
which he &s;hot at, fearing it would damage them, and killed it with the &s;econd arrow.</P>
<P>The &s;ummer being over, during which, hav|ing been much taken up about his habitation and plantations, he had neither time nor op|portunity to make remarks, farther than it was &s;ome days very &s;howery, and for the mo&s;t part generally very hot; but now the weather being grown &s;omething cold, and the wind pretty &s;harp, he mu&s;t be obliged to put on &s;ome cloaths to keep it off, being as yet too tender to go any longer without; next to provide for his ante|lopes again&s;t the approaching winter; &s;o makes a lodge for them, at the back&s;ide of his kitchen, with &s;ticks, which he drove into the ground, about two feet from the wall, and then bends them about three feet from the ground, and &s;licks them in the &s;aid wall, and &s;maller bran|ches he interwove between them: he &s;huts up the front, and covers the top, leaving both ends open for the antelopes to go in at; then lays gra&s;s (which he dried on purpo&s;e) in the &s;aid lodge, for them to lie on. Thus, having dug up a con&s;iderable quantity of roots, and being already &s;tocked with &s;alt-fi&s;h, both dry and in pickle, he was pretty well provided for his cat|tle and him&s;elf, again&s;t the en&s;uing winter, which proved much like the preceding one, only not &s;o &s;tormy.</P>
<P>The &s;ucceeding &s;pring having awaked &s;lum|bering nature, and revived what the preceding hard &s;ea&s;on had cau&s;ed to droop, every vege|table puts on new cloathing and recovers its wonted beauty; each animal a&s;&s;umes fre&s;h vi|gour; the bea&s;ts in the wood leap and bound
<PB N="145" REF="030190_0150_0FE5062A6BCFCE18">
for joy, and each bird on the trees &s;ings for gladne&s;s. The whole creation is, as it were, repaired, and every creature decked with new life. Love by Nature's direction, for the in|crea&s;e of every kind, warms their harmle&s;s brea&s;ts; each animal &s;eeks a mate; our tame antelopes quit their abode, and range the woods for the relief ordained to quell their innocent pa&s;&s;ion; which being a&s;&s;uaged, they return home, pregnant with young, to their ma&s;ter's great &s;atisfaction; who, having given them over, was doubly rejoiced to &s;ee them come a|gain in an increa&s;ing condition. <Q>Heaven be prai&s;ed! &s;aid he, I &s;hall have a &s;tock of my own, and will not fear wanting.</Q></P>
<P>So, having made fitting preparations again&s;t their kidding, he goes and examines the im|provement of his new plantation, where he found his roots grown full as large as any of tho&s;e that grew wild. <Q>Make me thankful! &s;aid he, I am new provided with all nece&s;&s;ary food. I &s;hall no more need to rob tho&s;e poor creatures of that which Nature had pro|vided for their own proper u&s;e.</Q> Next he goes and views his &s;mall &s;tock of peas and beans, which he found in a very promi&s;ing ca&s;e. So, whil&s;t the weather was fair, he falls to clearing a &s;pot of ground to &s;et them in, as they increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>Turning up the ground he found &s;everal &s;orts of roots that looked to be eatable, &s;ome whereof were as big as a large carrot, others le&s;s. He broke a bit of every one, &s;ome of which breaking &s;hort, and being not &s;tringy, he judged they mu&s;t be eatable; then he &s;mells

them, and finding the &s;cent not di&s;agreeable, he ta&s;tes them. Some were &s;weeti&s;h, others &s;harp and hot, like hor&s;e-radi&s;h; and tho&s;e he propo&s;es to u&s;e in&s;tead of &s;pice. <Q>Sure, &s;aid he, the&s;e being of a plea&s;ant &s;cent and favour, cannot be offen&s;ive to nature.</Q> So having manured his ground, he takes a &s;ample of ev|ery root which he judged eatable, and boils them, as the &s;ure&s;t way to experience their goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of them proved not only pa&s;&s;able good, but extraordinary; &s;ome eating like par&s;nips, others almo&s;t like carrots, but rather more a|greeable; &s;ome like beets and turnips; every one in their &s;everal kinds, as good as ever he eat in England, but of different colours and make; &s;ome being blui&s;h, others black, &s;ome red, and others yellow. The&s;e though not wanted, having &s;ufficient to gratify a nicer ta&s;te than his, were, neverthele&s;s, extremely wel|come, being &s;omewhat like his native country fare and product. So having returned thanks for this mo&s;t agreeable addition to his ordinary, he &s;ets a mark to every herb which tho&s;e roots bore, in order to get &s;ome of the &s;eed to &s;ow in the ground he would prepare: &s;o, being pro|vided with fle&s;h, fi&s;h, herbs, and &s;everal &s;orts of roots, he goes and examines what improve|ment his peas and beans have made, which he found increa&s;ed to admiration; the &s;even peas having produced one thou&s;and, and the three beans one hundred: having returned thanks for that va&s;t increa&s;e, he lays them by, in order to &s;et them at a proper &s;ea&s;on, as he had done the year before.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="030190_0152_0FE50637106C73D8">
By this time his antelopes had kidded, one of them having brought three young ones, and the &s;econd two. This va&s;t addition to his pro|vi&s;ions very much rejoiced him, being &s;ure now not to want fle&s;h at his need, which before he was in danger of, finding but &s;eldom any thing in his net: &s;o makes account to live upon two of the young bucks whil&s;t they la&s;ted, killing one as &s;oon as fit for meat, and &s;o now and then another, &s;aving only five to breed; one whereof &s;hould be a mate to keep the females from the wood; le&s;t at one time or other they &s;hould &s;tay away for good and all.</P>
<P>The old ones being well fed, as he always took care to do, providing for them &s;tore of tho&s;e greens he knew they loved; as al&s;o boil|ed roots for them now and then, of which they are very fond; the young ones throve apace, and grew very fat: &s;o that in three weeks time they were large and fit to eat. He killed one; which being roa&s;ted, proved to be more deli|cious that any hou&s;e-lamb, &s;ucking pig, young fawn, or any other &s;uckling whatever.</P>
<P>Having lived upon that, with now and then a little fi&s;h, about one month, which was as long as he could keep it eatable, having dre&s;&s;ed it at two different times, five days interval; eating the cold remains in &s;everal manners; re&s;erving one of the other two males for a time he &s;hould be &s;canted, and in want of fle&s;h; but was unluckily di&s;appointed by a parcel of large eagles, which flying one morning over the place where the young antelopes were play|ing, being of a gay, as well as active di&s;po&s;i|tion, launched them&s;elves with precipitation
<PB N="148" REF="030190_0153_0FE50638A25A3080">
upon the male he re&s;erved for time of need, and one of the females which he kept for breed; &s;eeing his beloved diverters carrying away by tho&s;e birds of prey, he runs in for his bow, but came too late with it, the eagles being gone.</P>
<P>Having lo&s;t his two dear antelopes, e&s;pecial|ly the female, having doomed the male for his own eating, he hardly could forbear weeping to think of their being cruelly torn to pieces by tho&s;e ravenous creatures: thus having for &s;ome time lamented the lo&s;s, and bewailed their hard fate, he thinks on means to prevent the like evil for the time to come; and as his bow was not always at hand, he re&s;olves upon making a net, and fa&s;tens it between the trees he &s;aw them come in at.</P>
<P>The &s;ucceeding winter proving very wet and windy, gave him but little invitation to take his u&s;ual walks; &s;o having every thing he had occa&s;ion for at hand, he kept clo&s;e to his net-making; for which having twine to twi&s;t, and thread to ravel out to make the &s;aid twine, kept him employed till the following &s;pring, which came on apace.</P>
<P>Having fini&s;hed his net, and every thing which belonged to it, he goes and fa&s;tens it to the trees, as he had propo&s;ed; then takes a walk to his new plantations, which he found in a thriving condition; for which, and other bene|fits already received, he re&s;olves, as in duty bound, to attend at his u&s;ual place of wor&s;hip, and &s;ing thank&s;giving p&s;alms, which the hard|ne&s;s of the weather had kept him from all the late winter; but it now coming into his mind, that whil&s;t he was at his devotion, returning

thanks for the fair pro&s;pect of a plentiful crop, his antelopes would break into the clo&s;e, the hedge being as yet but thin, and devour the promi&s;ing buds, which are the principal occa|&s;ion of his devotion; this not altogether im|proper con&s;ideration puts a &s;ad check to his re|ligious intention: and though there was a va&s;t obligation to prompt him to the performance of that part of his duty, yet he could not, with wi&s;dom, run the hazard, out of mere devotion, to lo&s;e &s;o promi&s;ing a crop, which he &s;hould never be able to retrieve; all his &s;tock of &s;eed being then in gra&s;s.</P>
<P>As he was debating in his mind between re|ligion and rea&s;on, whether the latter ought not to be a director to the former, he perceived his antelopes making towards the peas, to which they, doubtle&s;s, would have got in, had he not returned, and driven them another way: which accident convinced him he might find a more proper time to go about his devotion; no man being required to wor&s;hip to his prejudice: &s;o, having put off his religious duty till he had better &s;ecured his peas and beans, he cuts a parcel of branches, wherewith he &s;tops tho&s;e gaps to prevent the creatures going in; and having completed his work, he goes to his de|votion, adding to his u&s;ual thank&s;giving a par|ticular collect for his luckily being in the way to prevent his being fru&s;trated of the ble&s;&s;ing Heaven &s;o fairly promi&s;ed to be&s;tow on his labours.</P>

different harmonious notes! <Q>Every thing in nature, &s;aid he, an&s;wers the end of its creation, but ungrateful man! who, ambi|tious to be wi&s;e as his Creator, only learns to make him&s;elf wretched.</Q> Thus he walks till evening, making &s;everal reflexions on the different conditions of men, preferring his pre|&s;ent &s;tate to that of Adam before his fall, who could not be &s;en&s;ible of happine&s;s, having ne|ver known a rever&s;e; which, otherwi&s;e, he would have been more careful to prevent. Be|ing come home, and near bed-time, he fir&s;t ate his &s;upper, and then, having performed his cu&s;tomary religious &s;ervice, he goes to bed. The next morning, after paying his u&s;ual de|votion, he takes a walk to his plantations, on which he implores a continuation of the pro&s;|perous condition they appear to be in; next, he goes to examine his nets, in which he finds a brace of fowls like ducks, but twice as large, and exceeding beautiful: the drake (which he knew by a coloured feather on his rump) was of a fine cinnamon colour upon his back, his brea&s;t of a mazarine blue, the belly of a deep orange, his neck green, head purple, his eyes, bill, and feet, red; every colour changing mo&s;t agreeably as they moved. The duck was al&s;o very beautiful, but of quite different colours, and much paler than the drake's.</P>
<P>The di&s;appointment in catching tho&s;e de|lightful fowls, in&s;tead of ravenous eagles, as he had purpo&s;ed, no ways di&s;plea&s;ed him, but he rather was rejoiced to have &s;uch beautiful fowls to look at; yet it went much again&s;t his mind to deprive tho&s;e creatures of their liberty (the

greate&s;t comfort in life) which nature took &s;uch pains to adorn: <Q>But, &s;aid he, they were created for the u&s;e of man: &s;o, in keeping them for my plea&s;ure, they will but an&s;wer the end of their creation. Their confine|ment &s;hall be no &s;tricter than my own; they &s;hall have the whole i&s;land to range in.</Q> He then pinions them, puts them in the pond, and makes ba&s;kets for them to &s;helter in, which he places in the branches of tho&s;e trees that hung clo&s;e&s;t to the water, taking particular care to feed them daily with roots roa&s;ted and boiled, and the guts of the fi&s;h, and other creatures, he u&s;ed for his own eating; which made them thrive mainly, and take to the place; &s;o that they bred in their &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>The five antelopes had by this time kidded, and brought ten young ones: his peas and beans al&s;o were wonderfully improved, having that &s;ea&s;on enough to &s;tock the ground the year following. Thus he returned kind Providence thanks for the va&s;t increa&s;e, and concludes to live upon the young antelopes as long as they la&s;ted, re&s;erving only one for &s;uck of the old ones, to keep them in milk, of which he had taken notice they had plenty, de&s;igning to draw it daily for his own u&s;e; &s;o that in a little time, he had enough to &s;kim for cream, which he u&s;ed for &s;auce in&s;tead of butter, and made &s;mall chee&s;es of the re&s;t. Now having a pret|ty &s;tore of dairy ware, he re&s;olves to make a place to keep it in; the kitchen wherein he was obliged to lay his &s;alt fi&s;h (which common|ly &s;mells &s;trong,) not being a proper place for cream and milk: for which end he makes a

dairy-hou&s;e at the other &s;ide of his dwelling, with branches of trees, after the manner of a clo&s;e arbour, and thatches it over with gra&s;s; which an&s;wering the kitchen in form and &s;itua|tion, made uniform wings, that added as much to the beauty as conveniency of the habitation.</P>
<P>Having completed his dairy, he proceeds in his re&s;olution of making chee&s;e, having learned the way in Holland; and for want of rennet to turn his milk, he takes &s;ome of the hor&s;e|radi&s;h &s;eed, which being of a hot nature, had the &s;ame effect: having curd to his mind, he &s;ea&s;ons it to his palate; then with his hatchet, he cuts a notch round in the bark of a tree, a|bout eighteen inches in circumference; and a &s;econd in the &s;ame manner, &s;ix inches below that; then &s;lits the circle, and with his knife gently opens it, parting it from the tree: thus he makes as many hoops as he judged would contain his pa&s;te, which being girded round with cords to keep them from opening, he fills with the &s;aid pa&s;te, and lays them by, till fit to eat.</P>
<P>This being done, which completed his pro|vi&s;ions, he returns thanks for tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings which had been &s;o liberally be&s;towed on him: <Q>Now, &s;aid he, Heaven be prai&s;ed!

<P>In that di&s;po&s;ition he goes to bed, and &s;oon fell a&s;leep: the night al&s;o, being windy, added to his di&s;po&s;ition; but his mind finds no re|po&s;e: it &s;till run heavy upon the &s;ubject that took it up the day before, and forms ideas &s;uit|able to his inclination; and as &s;olitude was the motive of its being di&s;turbed, he indulges it with the thoughts of company, dreaming that the &s;ame of his &s;tation, and happy &s;tate of life, was &s;pread about the world; that it prompted a va&s;t number of people, from all parts, to come to it, which at la&s;t induced &s;e|veral princes to claim a right to it; which be|ing decided by a bloody war, a governor was &s;ent, who laid taxes, demanded duties, rai&s;ed rents, and warns him to be gone, having fixed upon his habitation for him&s;elf to dwell in. Being &s;adly di&s;turbed, he cries out in his &s;leep, <Q>This is a great puni&s;hment for my unea&s;ine&s;s: could I not be contented with being lord of this i&s;land, without provoking Heaven to bring me under the power of extorting go|vernors?</Q></P>
<P>There happening a great noi&s;e, he &s;tarts out of his &s;leep, with the thoughts of hearing a pro|clamation; and cries out, <Q>Alas! it is too late to proclaim an evil which is already come:</Q> but being thoroughly awake, and

This occa&s;ioned &s;everal re|flexions on the frivolous, and often unju&s;t quar|rels that ari&s;e among princes, which create &s;uch bloody wars, as prove the de&s;truction of va&s;t numbers of their &s;ubjects. <Q>If monarchs &s;aid he, always acted with as much rea&s;on as the&s;e creatures, how much blood and money would they &s;ave!</Q> Thus he goes on to his u&s;ual place of wor&s;hip, in order to return thanks, that he was free of that evil, the dream where|of had &s;o tortured his mind; though he confe&s;&s;|ed he ju&s;tly de&s;erved the reality, for his unea&s;i|ne&s;s in the happie&s;t of circum&s;tances.</P>

yet the unwi&s;e man, as if an enemy to his ea&s;e, cannot be contented with the enjoyment of more than he could rea&s;onably crave, but mu&s;t di&s;turb his mind with what concerns him not: <Q>What pity, &s;aid he, &s;o delightful a habi|tation, attended with &s;uch conveniences, and &s;ituated in &s;o whole&s;ome an air, and fruitful a land, &s;hould at my death lo&s;e all tho&s;e wonderful properties, being become u&s;ele&s;s for want of &s;omebody to enjoy them!

That he &s;hall, after any tempe&s;tuous wind or &s;torm, vi&s;it the &s;ea at the out&s;ide of the rock, at the ea&s;t, &s;outh, we&s;t, and north ends, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t any one in di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>He &s;hall not be wa&s;teful of any thing what|&s;oever, e&s;pecially of any creature's life; killing no more than what is nece&s;&s;ary for his health: but &s;hall every day examine his nets, &s;etting at liberty the overplus of his nece&s;&s;ity, le&s;t they &s;hould peri&s;h in their confinement.</P>
<P>He mu&s;t al&s;o keep every thing in the &s;ame order and cleanne&s;s he &s;hall find them in; till and manure the ground yearly; &s;et and &s;ow plants and &s;eeds, fit for food, in their proper &s;ea&s;ons.</P>
<P>Having written this at the bottom of the map he had drawn, being &s;upper time, he takes his meal; then goes to his u&s;ual evening de|votion; and, after an hour's walk, to his bed, &s;leeping quietly all night, as being ea&s;y in his mind.</P>
<P>The next morning he takes his u&s;ual walks, and vi&s;its his nets. In that he had &s;et for eagles, he found a fowl as big as a turkey, but the colour of a phea&s;ant, only a tail like a par|tridge; this having no &s;ign of being a bird of prey, he was loth to kill it; but having had no fre&s;h meat for above a week, he yields to his appetite, and dre&s;&s;es it, eating part thereof for his dinner: it was very fat and plump, and eat much like a phea&s;ant, but rather tenderer, and fuller of gravy.</P>
<P>Though he was very well plea&s;ed with the bird he had taken, yet he had rather it had been one of the eagles which kept his young ante|lopes

in jeopardy: but as he could not de&s;troy them with his net, which he had hung a con|&s;iderable time without the intended &s;ucce&s;s, he projects the prevention of their increa&s;e, by de|&s;troying their eggs, leaving his nets wholly for the u&s;e they had been &s;ucce&s;sful in; and &s;earches the clifts of the rock next the &s;ea, where tho&s;e birds commonly build; where having found &s;everal ne&s;ts, he takes away the eggs that were in them, being then their breed|ing time, and carries them home, in order to empty the &s;hells, and hang them up and down in his habitation, among&s;t the green leaves which covered the cieling thereof; but having accidentally broke one, and the yolk and white thereof being like that of a turkey, he had the curio&s;ity to boil one and ta&s;te it, which eat much after the manner of a &s;wan's. The re&s;t he &s;aved to eat now and then for a change, reaping a double advantage by robbing tho&s;e birds; le&s;&s;ening thereby the damage they might do him in time, and adding a di&s;h to his pre|&s;ent fare.</P>
<P>In this pro&s;perous way he lived fifteen years, finding no alteration in the weather or &s;ea&s;ons, nor meeting in all the time with any tran&s;acti|ons worthy of record: &s;till performing his u&s;ual exerci&s;es, and taking his walks with all the content and &s;atisfaction his happy condition could procure; entirely for&s;aking all thoughts and de&s;ires of ever quitting the ble&s;&s;ed &s;tation he then had in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Thus having walked the i&s;land over and over (which though delightful, yet the frequent re|petition of the wonders it produces, renders

<P>The day being fair, and the weather as calm, he &s;at down upon the rock, taking plea&s;ure in &s;eeing the waves roll, and, as it were, cha&s;e one another; the next pur&s;uing the fir&s;t, on which it rides, when come at; and being it&s;elf overtaken by a &s;ucceeding, is al&s;o mounted on thus, wave upon wave, till a bulky body is compo&s;ed, too heavy for the undermo&s;t to bear, and then &s;inks all together: this, &s;aid he, is a true emblem of ambition; men &s;triving to out|do one another are often undone.</P>
<P>As he was making reflexions on the empti|ne&s;s of vanity and pride, returning Heaven thanks, that he was &s;eparated from the world, which abounds in nothing el&s;e; a &s;hip appears at a great di&s;tance, a &s;ight he had not &s;een &s;ince his &s;hipwreck: <Q>Unlucky invention; &s;aid he, that thou &s;hould&s;t ever come into men's thoughts! the ark, which gave the fir&s;t notion of a floating habitation, was or|dered for the pre&s;ervation of man; but its fatal copies daily expo&s;e him to de&s;truction.</Q> Having therefore returned Heaven thanks for his being out of tho&s;e dangers, he makes a &s;o|lemn vow, never to return into them again, though it were to gain the world: but his re|&s;olution proved as brittle as his nature was frail. The men on board had &s;pied him out with their per&s;pective gla&s;&s;es; and &s;uppo&s;ing him to be &s;hipwrecked, and to want relief, &s;ent their long-boat with two men to fetch him away.</P>

At their approach his heart alters its motion; his blood &s;tops from its common cour&s;e; his &s;inews are all relaxed, which intirely unframes his rea&s;on, and makes him a &s;tranger to his own inclination; which &s;truggling with his waver|ing re&s;olution, occa&s;ions a debate between hope and fear; but the boat being come pretty nigh, gave hope the advantage, and his late re&s;olu|tion yields to his revived inclination, which be|ing now encouraged by a probable opportunity of being an&s;wered, ru&s;hes on to execution. He now, quitting all his former reliance on Pro|vidence, depends altogether upon his getting away, ble&s;&s;ing the lucky opportunity of &s;eeing his ble&s;&s;ed country again, for which plea&s;ure he freely quits and for&s;akes all the happine&s;s he enjoyed; gladly abandoning his delightful ha|bitation, and plentiful i&s;land. He thinks no more of Providence; his mind is intirely ta|ken up with his voyage; but di&s;appointment, which often attends the greate&s;t probabilities, &s;natches &s;ucce&s;s out of his hand before he could gra&s;p it, and intercepts his &s;uppo&s;ed infallible retreat; the boat could not approach him, by rea&s;on of the rocks running a great way into the &s;ea under water; nor could he come at the boat for &s;harp points, and deep holes, which made it unfordable, as well as unnavigable; &s;o that after &s;everal hours &s;triving in vain on both &s;ides to come at one another; the men, after they had &s;triven all they could but to no purpo&s;e, &s;aid &s;omething to him in a rage, which he under&s;tood not, and went without him, more wretched now, than when he was fir&s;t ca&s;t away.

him abandon all further reliance on Providence, whom then he could implore; but now, hav|ing ungratefully de&s;pi&s;ed Heaven's bounties, which had been &s;o largely be&s;towed on him, he has forfeited all hopes of a&s;&s;i&s;tance from thence, and expects none from the world. Thus de&s;titute, and in the greate&s;t perplexity, he cries out, <Q>whither &s;hall I now fly for help? The world can give me none, and I dare not crave any more from Heaven. O cur&s;ed delu&s;ion! but rather cur&s;ed weakne&s;s! why did I give way to it? had I not enough of the world, or was I grown weary of being happy?</Q> So, &s;aying, he falls a weeping: <Q>Could I &s;hed a flood of tears, &s;ufficient to wa&s;h away my fault or ea&s;e me of the remor&s;e it does create!</Q></P>
<P>The pains and labour he had been at in the day, climbing up and down the rock, drag|ging him&s;elf to and fro, to come at the boat, having very much brui&s;ed his limbs; and the di&s;appointment of his full dependance on the late promi&s;ing &s;ucce&s;s, as al&s;o the tormenting remor&s;e, and heavy grief, for his &s;inful reliance thereon, much fatiguing his mind, rendered &s;leep, which is ordained for the refre&s;hment of nature, of &s;mall relief to him; his thoughts are continually di&s;turbed with frightful vi&s;ions; all his pa&s;t dangers glare at him, as if threat|ening their return.</P>
<P>Being now awaked from his di&s;agreeable &s;leep, he makes a firm re&s;olution never to en|deavour to go from hence, whatever oppor|tunity offers, though attended with ever &s;o great a probability of &s;ucce&s;s, and pro&s;pect of gain; fully &s;ettling his whole mind and affec|tion

<P>Thus having entirely bani&s;hed the world out of his mind, which before often di&s;turbed it, he limits his thoughts within the bounds of his ble&s;&s;ed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which affords him more than is &s;ufficient to make his life happy; where plenty flows on him, and plea&s;ure attends his de&s;ires; abounding in all things that can gra|tify his appetite, or delight his fancy: a herd of delightful antelopes, bounding and playing about his habitation, divert him at home; and in his walks he is entertained with the harmo|ny of divers kinds of &s;inging-birds; every place he comes at offers him new objects for plea&s;ure: thus all &s;eems to concur in complete|ing his happine&s;s.</P>
<P>In this mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed &s;tate he thinks him&s;elf as Adam before his fall, having no room for wi&s;hes, only that every thing may continue in its pre&s;ent condition; but it cannot be expect|ed, that fair weather, which &s;miles on the earth's beauty, will not change.

Having con&s;idered what to make a wrapper of, he concludes upon u&s;ing of the gra&s;s he made mats of, on which he lay, being &s;oft and warm, very fit for that purpo&s;e: of this he cuts down a &s;ufficient quantity, which, when ready to work, he makes &s;mall twine with, and plaits it in narrow braids, which he &s;ews together with &s;ome of the &s;ame, and &s;hapes a long loo&s;e gown, that covered him to his heels, with a cap of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>By that time he had fini&s;hed his winter-garb, the weather was grown cold enough for him to put it on. The fro&s;ty &s;ea&s;on came on apace, in which there fell &s;uch a quantity of &s;now, that he was forced to make a broom, and &s;weep it away from about his habitation twice a day; as al&s;o the path he made to the places he had oc|ca&s;ion to go to, to&s;&s;ing the &s;now on each &s;ide, which before the winter was over, met at top, and covered it all the way; which obliged him to keep within doors for a con&s;iderable time, and melt &s;now in&s;tead of water; le&s;t, when going for &s;ome, he might chance to be buried among&s;t the &s;now.</P>
<P>The winter being over, and the &s;now di&s;&s;olv|ed, the gay &s;pring advances apace, offering nature its u&s;ual a&s;&s;i&s;tance, repairing the dam|ages the la&s;t fro&s;t had done; which joyful tid|ings made every thing &s;mile. Quarll, al&s;o, finding him&s;elf revived, took his former walks, which the preceding bad weather had kept him from, though there had been no con&s;iderable &s;torm the winter before.</P>
<P>He having a mind to view the &s;ea, and being come to the out&s;ide of the north-we&s;t end of
<PB N="165" REF="030190_0170_0FE5068540454E30">
the rock, &s;ees, at the foot thereof, &s;omething like part of the body of a large hollow tree, the ends whereof were &s;topped with its own pitch; and the middle, which was &s;lit open from end to end, gaping by a &s;tick laid acro&s;s.</P>
<P>This put him in mind of canoes, with which Indians paddle up and down their lakes and ri|vers; and being on that &s;ide the rock next to the i&s;land of California, he fancied &s;ome of them were come to vi&s;it this i&s;land, though not many in number; their canoes holding at mo&s;t but two men; for the generality, one only: yet, as &s;ome of the&s;e people are accounted great thieves, daily robbing one another, he ha&s;tens home to &s;ecure what he had; but it was too late; they had been there already, and had ta|ken away the cloaths he found in the che&s;t; which being by far too little for him, hung carele&s;sly on a pin behind his door. Had they been contented with that, he would not have regarded it; but they carried away &s;ome of his curious &s;hells, and, what grieved him mo&s;t, the fine bird he had taken &s;uch pains to dre&s;s and &s;tuff, and care to pre&s;erve; as al&s;o his bow and arrows.</P>
<P>Having mi&s;&s;ed the&s;e things, which he much valued, he ha&s;tens to the out&s;ide of the rock, with his long &s;taff in his hand, in hopes to over|take them before they could get into their ca|noe; but happened to go too late, they being already got half a league from the rock. Yet they did not carry away their theft: for there ari&s;ing &s;ome wind, it made the &s;ea &s;omewhat rough, and over&s;et their canoe; &s;o that what was in it was all lo&s;t, but the two Indians, who
<PB N="166" REF="030190_0171_0FE50689A38EDFF0">
mo&s;t dexterou&s;ly turned it on its bottom again, and with &s;urpri&s;ing activity leaped in it, one at the one &s;ide, and the other at the oppo&s;ite; &s;o that the canoe being trimmed at once, they paddled out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>Having &s;een as much of them as he could, he walks to the north-ea&s;t &s;ide, in order to di&s;|cover the effect of the high wind, which hap|pened the night before.</P>
<P>Being come to the out&s;ide of the rock, he perceives &s;omething at a di&s;tance like a large che&s;t, but having no lid on it; taking that to be the product of &s;ome late &s;hipwreck, he grieved at the fatal accident; <Q>How long, reflected he, will covetou&s;ne&s;s decoy men to pur&s;ue wealth, at the co&s;t of their precious lives? Has not nature provided every nation and country a &s;ufficiency for its inhabitants? that they will rove on this mo&s;t dangerous and boi&s;terous &s;ea, which may be titled Death's dominions, many peri&s;hing therein, and not one on it being &s;afe.</Q></P>
<P>As he was bewailing their fate who he ima|gined had been ca&s;t away, he &s;ees two men come down the rock, with each a bundle in his arm, who went to that which he had taken to be a che&s;t; and, having put their load in it, pu&s;hed it away till come to deep water; then, having got in it, with a long &s;taff, &s;hoved it off, till they could row to a long boat that lay at &s;ome di&s;tance behind a jetting part of the rock, which &s;creened it from his &s;ight, as al&s;o the &s;hip it belonged to.</P>
<P>The &s;ight of this much amazed him, and made him cea&s;e condoling others' &s;uppo&s;ed lo&s;s,
<PB N="167" REF="030190_0172_0FE5069B1049EFE8">
to run home and examine his own; well know|ing tho&s;e bundles, he &s;aw carried away, mu&s;t needs belong to him, there being no other moveables in the i&s;land but what were in his lodge.</P>
<P>Being come home, he finds indeed what he &s;u&s;pected; tho&s;e villains had mo&s;t &s;acrilegiou&s;|ly rifled and ran&s;acked his habitation, not leav|ing him &s;o much as one of the mats to keep his poor body from the ground; his winter garb al&s;o is gone, and what el&s;e they could find for their u&s;e.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of tho&s;e things, which he could not do without, filled him with &s;orrow. <Q>Now, &s;aid he, I am in my fir&s;t &s;tate of being; nak|ed I came into the world, and naked I &s;hall go out of it;</Q> at which he fell a weeping.</P>
<P>Having grieved a while, <Q>Why, &s;aid he, &s;hould I thus ca&s;t my&s;elf down! Is not Pro|vidence, who gave me them, able to give me more?</Q> Thus, having re&s;olved before win|ter to repleni&s;h his lo&s;s, he re&s;ts him&s;elf con|tented, and gives the ruffians' evil action the be&s;t con&s;truction he could. <Q>Now I think on it, &s;aid he, the&s;e &s;urely are the men, who, about twelve months &s;ince, would charitably have carried me hence, but could not for want of nece&s;&s;ary implements; and now be|ing better provided, came to accompli&s;h their ho&s;pitable de&s;ign; but not finding me, &s;uppo&s;ing I was either dead or gone, took a|way what was here of no u&s;e; much good may what they have got do them, and may it be of as much u&s;e to them as it was to me.</Q> Thus he walks out, in order to cut gra&s;s to dry,
<PB N="168" REF="030190_0173_0FE5069C98C61E08">
and make him&s;elf new bedding, and a winter garb.</P>
<P>Having walked about half a mile, he per|ceives the &s;ame men coming towards the pond. <Q>Heaven be prai&s;ed! &s;aid he, here they be &s;till. Now when they &s;ee I am not gone, nor willing to go, they will return my things, which they are &s;en&s;ible I cannot do without,</Q> with which words he goes up to them.</P>
<P>By this time they had caught the two old ducks, which, being pinioned, could not fly a|way as the re&s;t did. He was much vexed to &s;ee the be&s;t of his &s;tock thus taken away, yet, as he thought they were come to do him &s;er|vice, he could grudge them nothing, that would any wi&s;e gratify them for &s;o good an in|tent. But having returned them thanks for their good will, he told them he was very hap|py in the i&s;land, and had made a vow never to go out of it.</P>
<P>The&s;e being Frenchmen, and of an employ|ment where politene&s;s is of little u&s;e, being fi&s;hermen, and not under&s;tanding what he &s;aid, only laughed in his face, and went on to the purpo&s;e they came about: then having as many of the ducks as they could get, they proceeded towards the hou&s;e where they had &s;een the an|telopes, &s;ome of which not running away at their approach, they propo&s;ed to catch hold of them.</P>
<P>Being come to the place where they u&s;ed to feed, which was near the dwelling, the young ones, not being u&s;ed to &s;ee any men in cloaths, nor any body but their ma&s;ter, pre&s;ently &s;led; but the two old ones, which he had bred up,
<PB N="169" REF="030190_0174_0FE5069E22D10A48">
were &s;o tame, that they &s;tood &s;till, only when the men came to them, they kept clo&s;e to him, which gave the men opportunity to lay hold of them; when, notwith&s;tanding Quarll's repeat|ed intreaties, they tied a halter about their horns, and barbarou&s;ly led them away.</P>
<P>Quarll was grieved to the heart to &s;ee his darlings, which he had taken &s;uch care to breed up, and which were become the principal part of his delight, following him up and down, and which, by their jumping and playing before him often di&s;per&s;ed melancholy thoughts; notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e endearing qualifica|tions, thus hauled away: he weeps, and on his knees begs they may be left; and though they under&s;tood not his words, his actions were &s;o expre&s;&s;ive and moving, that had they had the humanity of canibals, who eat one another, they would have yielded to &s;o melting an object as the poor broken hearted Quarll was; but the inflexible boors went on, cruelly hauling and dragging the poor creatures, which, as if &s;en|&s;ible of the barbarity of the act, looked back to their afflicted ma&s;ter, as craving his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; which, at la&s;t, &s;o exa&s;perated him, that he was &s;everal times tempted to lay on the ravi&s;hers with his long &s;taff; as often was &s;topt by the following con&s;ideration: <Q>Shall I, &s;aid he, be the de&s;truction of my fellow creatures, to re&s;cue out of their hands, animals of which I have an improving &s;tore left, and deprive them of their healths, and perhaps of their lives, to recover what co&s;t me nought? Let them go with what they have, and the merit of their deed be their reward.</Q> Thus he
<PB N="170" REF="030190_0175_0FE506A2C008E940">
walks about melancholy, bemoaning his poor antelopes' fate, and his own misfortune: <Q>They were u&s;ed to liberty, &s;aid he, which they now are deprived of, and for which they will pine and die, which, for their &s;ake, I cannot but wi&s;h; for life without liberty is a con|tinual death.</Q></P>
<P>As he was walking, thinking (as it is u&s;ual after the lo&s;s of anything one loves) of the plea|&s;ure he had during the enjoyment, the ruffians having &s;ecured the poor animals, came back with ropes in their hands. <Q>What do they want next? &s;aid he, have they not all they de&s;ire; would they carry away my ha|bitation al&s;o? Sure they have no de&s;ign on my per&s;on; if &s;o, they will not take it &s;o ea&s;ily as they did my dear antelopes.</Q> Thus he re&s;olved to exerci&s;e his quarter &s;taff, if they offered to lay hands on him. The villains, who&s;e de&s;ign was to bind him, and &s;o carry him away, &s;eeing him armed and re&s;olute, did not judge it &s;afe for them to advance within the reach of his weapon, but keep at &s;ome di&s;tance, divining how to &s;eize him.</P>
<P>Quarll, who, by their con&s;ulting, gue&s;&s;ed at their de&s;ign, not thinking proper to let them come to a re&s;olution, makes at the neare&s;t, who immediately takes to his heels, and then to the next, who immediately does the &s;ame. Thus he follows them about for a con&s;iderable time; but they divided, in order to the him with run|ning, till the night approaching, and the wind ri&s;ing, made them fear their retreat might be dangerous, if they deferred it; &s;o that they went clear away: which being all he de&s;ired,
<PB N="171" REF="030190_0176_0FE506AA8A923128">
he returned as &s;oon as he &s;aw them in the long|boat, which they rowed to their &s;hip, that lay at anchor &s;ome di&s;tance from the rocks.</P>
<P>The&s;e wretches being gone, he returns Hea|ven thanks for his deliverance; and as his bridge had favoured their coming, he pulls it off, and only laid it over when he had a mind to view the &s;ea, and goes home to eat a bit, hav|ing not as yet broken his fa&s;t. Having, there|fore, eaten &s;ome of his roots and chee&s;e, and being wearied with hunting the&s;e boors, he con|&s;ults how to lie, his bed and bedding being gone, as al&s;o his winter gown, and the nights being as yet cold: however, after a &s;mall con|&s;ideration, he concludes to lie in the lodge, which was left vacant by the &s;tolen antelopes ab&s;ence; who&s;e litter being made of the &s;ame gra&s;s as his mats were, he lay both &s;oft and warm.</P>
<P>Next morning having paid his u&s;ual devo|tion, he goes into the kitchen, in order to breakfa&s;t, and afterwards to take his cu&s;tomary walk. Whil&s;t he was eating, there aro&s;e a noi&s;e in the air, as proceeding from a quantity of rooks, jackdaws, crows, and &s;uch like birds, who&s;e common notes he was acquainted with; and as the noi&s;e approached, he had the curio|&s;ity to go and &s;ee what was the matter, but was prevented by the coming of a large fowl, which flew over his head, as he was going out; he turned back to gaze at the bird, who&s;e beauty &s;eized him with admiration; the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing &s;o charming a creature quite put out of his mind the curio&s;ity of looking from whence proceeded the di&s;agreeable noi&s;e with|out;
<PB N="172" REF="030190_0177_0FE506AC150CB3D0">
which cea&s;ing as &s;oon as the bird was &s;heltered, made him imagine tho&s;e carrion birds had been cha&s;ing that beautiful fowl, which, &s;eeing it&s;elf out of danger, &s;tood &s;till, very calm and compo&s;ed; which gave him the opportu|nity of making a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of every individual beauty which compo&s;ed; &s;o delightful an object; it was about the bigne&s;s and form of a &s;wan, almo&s;t headed like it, only the bill was not &s;o long nor &s;o broad, and red like coral; his eyes like tho&s;e of a hawk, his head of a mazarine blue, and on the top of it a tuft of &s;hining gold coloured feathers, which &s;pread over it, hang|ing near three inches beyond, all round; its brea&s;t, face, and part of its neck, milk white, curiou&s;ly &s;peckled with &s;mall black &s;pots, a gold coloured circle about it; its back and neck behind of a fine crim&s;on, &s;peckled with purple; its legs and feet the &s;ame colour as its bill; its tail long and round, &s;preading like that of a peacock, compo&s;ed of &s;ix rows of fea|thers, all of different colours, which made a mo&s;t delightful mixture.</P>
<P>Having &s;pent &s;everal minutes in admiring the bird, he lays peas, and crumbled roots, both roa&s;ted and boiled, before it; as al&s;o water in a &s;hell, withdrawing, to give it liberty to eat and drink; and &s;tood peeping to &s;ee what it would do: which, being alone, having looked about, picks a few peas, and drinks heartily; then walks towards the door in a compo&s;ed ea&s;y manner, much like that of a cock.</P>
<P>Quarll being at the out&s;ide, was dubious whether he &s;hould detain him, or let him go;
<PB N="173" REF="030190_0178_0FE506AD9F0B0198">
his affection for that admirable creature equally prompts him to both: he cannot bear the thoughts of parting with &s;o lovely an object, nor harbour that of depriving it of liberty, which it &s;o implicitly intru&s;ted him withal. Thus after a a &s;mall pau&s;e, genero&s;ity prevails over &s;elf-plea&s;ure; "Why &s;hould I," &s;aid he, "make the place of its refuge its pri&s;on?" He therefore makes room for it to go, which, with a &s;low pace, walks out; and having look|ed about a &s;mall time, mounts up a con&s;ider|able height; and then takes its cour&s;e north|we&s;t.</P>
<P>There happening nothing the remainder of the year worthy of record, he employs it in his cu&s;tomary occupations; as pruning and watering his lodge and dairy, making his mats to lie on, as al&s;o his winter garb; every day milking his antelopes and goats; making now and then butter and chee&s;e, attending his nets, and &s;uch like nece&s;&s;ary employments.</P>
<P>The mean time, the French mariners, who, probably, got money by what they had taken from him the year before, returned, it being much about the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on; and being re|&s;olved to take him away, and all they could make any thing of, out of the i&s;land, were provided with hands and implements to accom|pli&s;h their de&s;ign; as ropes to bind what they could get alive, and guns to &s;hoot what they could not come at, &s;aws and hatchets to cut down logwood and brazil, pick-axes and &s;hov|els to dig up orris roots, and others of worth, which they imagined the i&s;land produced; like|wi&s;e flat bottomed boats to tow in &s;hallow wa|ter,
<PB N="174" REF="030190_0179_0FE506B9F3356000">
where others could not come; and thus by degrees to load their &s;hip with booty: but ever watchful Providence bla&s;ted their evil pro|jects, and confounded their devices, at the very in&s;tant they thought them&s;elves &s;ure of &s;ucce&s;s; implements in a flat-bottomed boat were towed to the very foot of the rock, by a young fellow, who being lighter than a man, was thought fitte&s;t to go with the tools, which pretty well loaded the boat.</P>
<P>Their materials being landed, to their great &s;atisfaction, the men on board embarked in two more of the &s;ame &s;ort of boats; but were no &s;ooner in them, but a &s;torm aro&s;e, which da&s;hed their &s;lender bottoms to pieces, and wa&s;hed them into the &s;ea, in which they peri&s;h|ed, over&s;etting al&s;o the flat bottomed boat on &s;hore, with the load, and the lad underneath it.</P>
<P>The &s;torm being over, which la&s;ted from about eight in the morning till almo&s;t twelve at noon, Quarll, according to his cu&s;tom, went to &s;ee if he could perceive any damage done by the late tempe&s;t, and if any, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by it, &s;tood in want of help.</P>
<P>Being at that &s;ide of the rock he u&s;ed to vi|&s;it, he could &s;ee nothing but a few fi&s;hes and &s;hells the &s;ea had left in the clifts: <Q>If this, &s;aid he, be all the damage that has been done, make me thankful; it will recruit me with fre&s;h fi&s;h and uten&s;ils.</Q> Going to the N. W. part, where he &s;ees a battered boat, floating with the keel upwards, "This," &s;aid he, "bodes &s;ome mi&s;chief;" but thought it not to be of any con&s;equence. Having gone about
<PB N="175" REF="030190_0180_0FE506BCF8768B48">
fifty yards further, he e&s;pies a &s;mall barrel at the foot of the rock, with &s;everal planks and fragments of a &s;hip, floating with the tide: <Q>Alas! &s;aid he, the&s;e are too evident proofs of a &s;hipwreck, to hope otherwi&s;e.</Q> As he was looking about, he hears a voice cry out, much like that of a man, at &s;ome di&s;tance, be|hind a part of the rock: being advanced a &s;mall matter beyond where he was, <Q>Heaven be prai&s;ed! &s;aid he, there is &s;omebody, whom I am luckily come to &s;ave, and he is mo&s;t fortunately come to be my companion: I cannot but rejoice at the event, though I heartily grieve for the accident.</Q> Ha&s;tening to the place where he thought the cries came from, which, as he advanced, he could di&s;cern to be too &s;hrill for a man's voice, <Q>Certainly, &s;aid he, this mu&s;t be &s;ome woman by the noi&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>He then, with his &s;taff, endeavoured to break that which he took to be the lid of the che&s;t, but proved the bottom; and, as he was &s;trik|ing, the boy underneath, calling to him to turn it up, thru&s;t his hand under the &s;ide, which he perceiving, though he under&s;tood him not, &s;tood &s;till. Finding his mi&s;take, <Q>This, &s;aid he, is a flat bottomed boat, &s;uch as the Frenchmen u&s;ed the year before, when they came and plundered me. Now, am I &s;afe if I turn it up? doubtle&s;s they are come in great numbers.</Q> Pau&s;ing awhile, and the lad (whom he took to be a woman) &s;till con|tinuing his moan, he was moved to compa&s;|&s;ion; and, having con&s;idered the boat could not hold any great number, he ventures. <Q>Let
<PB N="176" REF="030190_0181_0FE506BF5D3182C0">
what will come on it, or who will be under, for the poor woman's &s;ake I will relieve them; there cannot be many men. However I will let but one out at a time; if he be mi&s;chie|vous, I am able to deal with him.</Q> At this, he puts the end of his &s;taff where he had &s;een the hand, and lifts it up about a foot from the ground. Out of the opening immediately creeps the boy, who, on his knees, falls a beg|ging and weeping, expecting death every mo|ment, as being the merited puni&s;hment for the evil purpo&s;e he came about.</P>
<P>Being affected with his &s;upplications, though the &s;ight of the preparations made for his in|tended ruin had moved him to anger again&s;t his mercenary companions, he helps the young fel|low up by the hand; and the night coming on apace, he takes one of the hatchets that lay by, and gave another to the boy, then falls a knock|ing the boat to pieces, and directed him to do the &s;ame, which he accordingly did.</P>
<P>The boat being demoli&s;hed, they carried the boards up higher on the rock, as al&s;o the re&s;t of the things; le&s;t, in the night, &s;ome &s;torm &s;hould ri&s;e, which might wa&s;h them back into the &s;ea; it being then too late to bring them away. Having done, they each of them took up what they could carry, and &s;o went home. The young Frenchman, finding a kinder treat|ment than either he de&s;erved or expected, was extraordinary &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and tractable; which made Quarll the more kind and mild; and in|&s;tead of condemning his evil attempt, he com|mi&s;erated his misfortune, and in room of re|&s;entment &s;howed him kindne&s;s. Thus having
<PB N="177" REF="030190_0182_0FE506C1044202F8">
given him of what he had to eat, he puts him to bed in his lodge, wherein he lay, till he had got his mats made up; then went to bed him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>The next morning he ro&s;e and walked about till he thought it time for the boy to ri&s;e; he then calls him up, and takes him to the place that he u&s;ually went to every morning and evening to &s;ing p&s;alms; where the youth being come, and hearing &s;o many different voices, and &s;eeing nobody, was &s;cared out of his wits, and took to his heels, making towards the rock as fa&s;t as he could; but as he was not acquaint|ed with the ea&s;ie&s;t and mo&s;t practicable parts thereof, Quarll had made an end of his p&s;alm, and overtook him before he could get to the &s;ea-&s;ide, into which he certainly would have ca&s;t him&s;elf at the fright; but Quarll, who, by the boy's &s;taring, gue&s;&s;ed his di&s;order, not having the benefit of the language, endeavour|ed to calm him by his plea&s;ing countenance, and prevented his drowning him&s;elf; but could not keep off a violent fit the fright had occa|&s;ioned, which held him &s;everal minutes.</P>
<P>The fit being over, he and the boy took away at divers times the remains of the boat, and what was in it, which they could not carry home the day before: then taking up two guns, <Q>Now, &s;aid he, the&s;e unlucky in&s;truments, which were intended for de&s;truction, &s;hall be employed for the pre&s;ervation of that they were to de&s;troy;</Q> and taking them to his lodge, &s;ets them at each &s;ide of the door; then being dinner time, he &s;trikes a light and &s;ets the boy to make a fire, whil&s;t he made &s;ome
<PB N="178" REF="030190_0183_0FE506CA5836EDC8">
of the fi&s;h fit to fry, which he picked up upon the rock the evening before; then takes the dripping he &s;aved, when he roa&s;ted any fle&s;h, to fry them with. The boy, who had lived &s;ome time in Holland, where they u&s;ed much butter, &s;eeing dripping employed in room thereof, thought to plea&s;e his ma&s;ter in making &s;ome; and as he had &s;een milk and cream in the dairy arbour, wanting a churn only, there being a &s;mall rundlet lying empty, he takes out one of the ends of it, in which, the next day, he beat butter.</P>
<P>Quarll, &s;eeing this youth indu&s;trious, be|gins to fancy him, notwith&s;tanding the aver&s;ion he had conceived for his nation, ever &s;ince the ill treatment he had received from his coun|trymen; and, as &s;peech is one of the mo&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;ary faculties to breed and maintain fellow|&s;hip, he took pains to teach him Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>The lad being acute and ingenious was &s;oon made to under&s;tand it, and in &s;ix months ca|pable to &s;peak it &s;ufficiently, &s;o as to give his ma&s;ter a relation of his late coming, and to what intent. <Q>The men, &s;aid he, who a|bout one year &s;ince carried away from hence &s;ome antelopes, with extraordinaty ducks, and &s;everal rarities, which they &s;aid belonged to a mon&s;trous Engli&s;h Hermit, who&s;e hair and beard covered his whole body, having got a great deal of money by &s;howing them, encouraged others to come; whereupon &s;e|veral joining together, hired a &s;hip to fetch away the Hermit, and what el&s;e they could find; therefore brought with them tools, and guns to &s;hoot what they could not take alive.</Q>

Barbarous wretches! replied he, to kill my dear antelopes and ducks! pray, what did they intend to do with me?</Q> <Q>Why, &s;aid the boy, to make a &s;how of you.</Q> <Q>To make a &s;how of me!

<P>Now, having company, he is obliged to en|large his bed, the lodge being wanted for his antelope again&s;t breeding time: he adds, there|fore, to his mats. His other provi&s;ions al&s;o wanting to be augmented, and he having both tools and boards, out of the flat boat which he had taken to pieces, he and the lad went about making large boxes to &s;alt fle&s;h and fi&s;h in; then, with the boards that were left, they made a table for his dwelling that he had before, and one for his kitchen; as al&s;o &s;helves in the room of tho&s;e that were made of wicker: then hav|ing recruited his &s;hell uten&s;ils that were &s;tolen the year before, he was completely furni&s;hed

with all manner of conveniences; and Provi|dence &s;upplying him daily with other nece&s;&s;a|ries, there was no room left him for wi&s;hes, but for thank&s;giving, which they daily mo&s;t religiou&s;ly paid.</P>
<P>In this mo&s;t happy &s;tate they lived in peace and concord the &s;pace of ten years, unanimou&s;ly doing what was to be done, as it lay in each of their ways, without relying on one another.</P>
<P>Quarll, who before, though alone and de|prived of &s;ociety (the principal comfort of life), thought him&s;elf ble&s;&s;ed, now cannot expre&s;s his happine&s;s, there being none in the world to be compared to it, heartily praying he might find no alteration until death: but the young man, not having met with &s;o many di&s;appoint|ments in the world as he, had not quite with|drawn his affections from it; his mind &s;ome|times will run upon his native country, where he has left his relations, and where he cannot help wi&s;hing to be him&s;elf: thus, an opportu|nity offering it&s;elf one day, as he went to get oy&s;ters, to make &s;ome &s;auce for &s;ome fre&s;h cod-fi&s;h which Quarll was dre&s;&s;ing, he &s;aw, at a di&s;tance, a &s;hip; at which his heart fell a panting; his pul&s;es double their motion; his blood grows warmer and warmer, till at la&s;t, inflamed with de&s;ire of getting at it, he lays down the bag he brought to put the oy&s;ters in, as al&s;o the in&s;trument to dredge them up with, and takes to &s;wimming. The men on board, having e&s;pied him out, &s;ent their boat to take him up; &s;o he went away without taking leave of him he had received &s;o much good from; who, having waited a con&s;iderable time, fear|ing

&s;ome accident would befal him, leaves his cooking, and goes to &s;ee for him; and, being come at the place where he was to get the oy&s;|ters, he &s;ees the bag and in&s;truments lie, and nobody with them. Having called &s;everal times without being an&s;wered, various racking fears tortured his mind: &s;ometimes he doubts he is fallen in &s;ome hole of the rock, there be|ing many near that place where the oy&s;ters were: he therefore with his &s;taff, which he al|ways carried with him when he went abroad, at the other &s;ide of the rock grabbled in every one round the place; and, feeling nothing, he concludes &s;ome &s;ea-mon&s;ter had &s;tolen him away, and, weeping, condemns him&s;elf as the cau&s;e of this fatal accident; re&s;olving for the future, to puni&s;h him&s;elf by denying his appetite; and only eat to &s;upport nature, and not to plea&s;e his palate.</P>
<P>Having given over hopes of getting him a|gain, he returns home in the greate&s;t affliction, re&s;olving to fa&s;t till that time the next day; but, happening to look we&s;tward, in which point the wind &s;tood, he perceives &s;omething like a boat at a great di&s;tance: wiping the tears off his eyes, and looking &s;tedfa&s;tly, he di&s;covers a &s;ail beyond it, which quite altered the motive of his former fear: <Q>No mon&s;ter, &s;aid he, hath devoured him: it is too plain a ca&s;e, that he has villainou&s;ly left me: but what could I expect of one who had project|ed &s;uch evil again&s;t me?</Q> So &s;aying he went home, and made an end of dre&s;&s;ing his dinner; re&s;ting him&s;elf contented, being but as he was before, and rather better, &s;ince he
<PB N="183" REF="030190_0188_0FE506DE5E48D2A8">
had more conveniences, and tools to till his ground, and dig up his roots with. Having recommended him&s;elf to Providence, he re|&s;umes his u&s;ual works and recreations, re&s;olv|ing that no cares &s;hall mar his happine&s;s for the future, being out of the way of all tho&s;e irre&s;i&s;tible temptations with which the world abounds, to lay the be&s;t men's hopes in the du&s;t.</P>
<P>Being again alone, the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of the hou&s;e lies upon his hands; he mu&s;t now prune and trim the habitation that daily harbours him, being made of fine growing plants, which yearly &s;hoot out young branches: this makes them grow out of &s;hape. He mu&s;t al&s;o till the ground; &s;et and gather his peas and beans in their &s;ea&s;on; milk and feed his antelopes daily; make butter and chee&s;e at proper times; dig up his roots; fetch in fuel and water when wanted; attend his nets; go to de&s;troy eagles ne&s;ts; and every day dre&s;s his own victuals: all which nece&s;&s;ary occupations, be&s;ides the time dedicated for his u&s;ual devotions, kept him wholly employed; which made his renewed &s;olitude le&s;s irk&s;ome. And, having walked all that afternoon to divert his thoughts, ad|miring all the way the wonderful works of nature, both in the &s;urpri&s;ing rocks which &s;ur|rounded the i&s;land, and in the delightful crea|tures, and admirable plants, that are in it; be|ing weary with walking, he returns home, thanking kind Providence for &s;ettling him in &s;o ble&s;&s;ed a place, and in his way calls at his invi&s;ible choir; where, having &s;ung a thank&s;|giving p&s;alm, and his u&s;ual evening hymn, he goes to &s;upper, and then to bed, with a tho|roughly

contented mind; which occa&s;ions plea|&s;ant dreams, to entertain his thoughts.</P>
<P>There happening a great noi&s;e of &s;quealing, it waked him out of his dream; and his mind being impre&s;&s;ed with notions of war, it at fir&s;t &s;eized him with terror: but being &s;omewhat &s;ettled, and the noi&s;e &s;till continuing, he per|ceived it proceeded from the two different kinds of monkeys in the i&s;land, which were fighting for the wild pomegranates that the high wind had &s;haken off the trees the prece|ding night which was very boi&s;terous.</P>
<P>Having gue&s;&s;ed the occa&s;ion of their debate, he ri&s;es, in order to go and quell their differ|ence, by dividing among&s;t them the cau&s;e thereof. Getting up, he opens the door, at the out&s;ide of which, an old monkey of each &s;ort were quietly waiting his levee, to entice him to come, as he once before did, and put an end to their bloody war.</P>
<P>He was not a little &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee two &s;uch inveterate enemies, who at other times never meet without fighting, at that juncture agree &s;o well.</P>
<P>That mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing &s;ign of rea&s;on in tho&s;e brutes, which, knowing his deci&s;ion would compo&s;e their comrades difference, came to implore it, put him upon the&s;e reflexions: <Q>Would princes, &s;aid he, be but rea&s;on|able, as tho&s;e which by nature are irrational, how much blood and money would be &s;av|ed;</Q> having admired the unea&s;ine&s;s of tho&s;e poor creatures, who &s;till went a few &s;teps for|ward, and then backward to him; he was in hopes to decoy one or both into his lodge, by
<PB N="185" REF="030190_0190_0FE506E172561008">
throwing meat to them: but tho&s;e exemplary animals, hearing their fellows in trouble, had no regard to their &s;eparate intere&s;t, taking no notice of what he gave them; but kept walk|ing to and again with all the tokens of unea|&s;ine&s;s they could expre&s;s; which &s;o moved him, that he ha&s;tened to the place; where his pre|&s;ence cau&s;ed immediately a ce&s;&s;ation of arms, and both parties retired a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from each other, waiting his &s;haring the wind|falls; which being done, they quietly took that heap which lay next each kind, and went to their different quarters.</P>
<P>Fourteen years more being pa&s;&s;ed, every thing keeping its natural cour&s;e, there hap|pened nothing extraordinary, each &s;ucceeding year renewing the plea&s;ures the preceding had produced. Thunders and high winds being frequent, though not equally violent, he thought it not material to record them, or their effects; as blowing and throwing fi&s;hes, &s;hells, empty ve&s;&s;els, battered che&s;ts, &amp;c. upon the rock; only tran&s;actions and events wonderful and un|common: and there happened a mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing one a few days after, which though of no great moment, is as worthy of record as any of far greater concern; being a wonderful effect of Providence, manife&s;ted in a miraculous man|ner, though not to be &s;aid &s;upernatural.</P>
<P>One morning, when he had roa&s;ted a parcel of tho&s;e roots which he u&s;ed to eat in&s;tead of bread, and this he commonly did once a week, they eating be&s;t when &s;tale; having &s;pread them on his table and che&s;t to cool, he went
<PB N="186" REF="030190_0191_0FE506F108A21540">
out to walk, leaving his door open to let the air in.</P>
<P>His walk, though graced with all the agree|ables nature could adorn it with to make it de|lightful; a gra&s;s carpet, embroidered with beautiful flowers, of many different colours and &s;mells, under his feet, to tread on; before, and on each &s;ide of him, fine lofty trees, of various forms and heights, cloathed with plea|&s;ant green leaves, trimmed with rich blo&s;&s;oms of many colours, to divert his eye; a number of various &s;orts of melodious &s;inging birds perching in their mo&s;t lovely &s;hades, as though nature had &s;tudied to excel man's brighte&s;t imagination, and exqui&s;itene&s;s of art: yet all the&s;e profu&s;ene&s;&s;es of nature's wonders are not &s;ufficient to keep away or expel anxious thoughts from his mind. It runs upon his two dear an|telopes, the darling heads of his pre&s;ent &s;tock, which he took &s;uch care to bring up, and were &s;o engaging, always attending him in tho&s;e fine walks; adding, by their &s;wift races, active leapings, and other uncommon diver&s;ions, to the natural plea&s;antne&s;s of the place; which now, by their mo&s;t lamented ab&s;ence, is be|come a dull memorandum of the barbarous manner in which they were ravi&s;hed away from him.</P>
<P>In the&s;e melancholy thoughts, which his lone&s;omene&s;s every now and then created, he returns home, where Providence had left a re|medy for his grievance: a companion, far ex|ceeding any he ever had, waits his return; which was a beautiful monkey of the fine&s;t kind, and the mo&s;t complete of the &s;ort, as
<PB N="187" REF="030190_0192_0FE506F2A3F644B0">
though made to manife&s;t the unparalleled &s;kill of nature, and &s;ent him by Providence to di&s;|&s;ipate his melancholy.</P>
<P><FIGURE>

<P>Being come to his lodge, and beholding that wonderful creature, and in his own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, at the farthe&s;t end of it, and him at the en|trance thereof to oppo&s;e its flight, if offered, he is at once filled with joy and admiration: <Q>Long, &s;aid he, I endeavoured in vain to get one, and would have been glad of any, though of the wor&s;t kind, and even of the meane&s;t of the &s;ort; and here kind Provi|dence has &s;ent me one of an unparalleled beauty.</Q></P>
<P>Having a con&s;iderable time admired the bea&s;t, which all the while &s;tood unconcerned, now and then eating of the roots that lay before him, he &s;huts the door, and goes in, with a re&s;olution of &s;taying within all day in order to
<PB N="188" REF="030190_0193_0FE506F46FA649B8">
tame him, which he hoped would be no diffi|cult matter, his di&s;po&s;ition being already pretty familiar, little thinking that Providence, who &s;ent him thither, had already qualified him for the commi&s;&s;ion he bore; which having found out by the creature's &s;urpri&s;ing docility, he re|turns his Benefactor his mo&s;t hearty thanks for that miraculous gift.</P>
<P>This mo&s;t wonderful animal, having by its &s;urpri&s;ing tractability and good nature, joined to its matchle&s;s hand&s;omene&s;s, gained its ma&s;|ter's love, beyond what is u&s;ual to place on any &s;ort of bea&s;ts; he thought him&s;elf doubly re|compen&s;ed for all his former lo&s;&s;es, e&s;pecially for that of his late ungrateful companion, who, notwith&s;tanding all the obligations he held from him, ba&s;ely left him, at a time he might be mo&s;t helpful; and as he fancied his dear Beau&s;iddle (for &s;o he called that admirable creature) had &s;ome &s;ort of re&s;emblance to the picture he framed of him, he takes it down, thinking it unju&s;t to bear in his &s;ight that vile object, which could not in any wi&s;e claim a like|ne&s;s to &s;o worthy a creature as his beloved mon|key.</P>
<P>One day that Quarll had occa&s;ion to go out, he happened to leave his pen and ink upon the table and &s;ome parchment he had been writing on clo&s;e by it; Beau&s;iddle perceiving his ma&s;|ter from home, immediately falls to work, &s;cribbling over every word Quarll had been writing; and when done, he laid it by in the che&s;t, as he &s;aw his ma&s;ter do with what he had written; he then takes out another, which he does the &s;ame to, and &s;o to half a dozen more,
<PB N="189" REF="030190_0194_0FE506F5FAD87BD0">
until his ma&s;ter's return prevented his doing any more mi&s;chief; however, in a quarter of an hour that he was ab&s;ent, he blotted out as much as had taken full &s;ix months in writing.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Another day, as this lovely animal was of|ficiating the charge it had of its own accord taken, being gone for wood, as wont to do when wanted, he finds in his way a wild pome|granate, who&s;e extraordinary &s;ize and weight had cau&s;ed it to fall off the tree: he takes it home, and then returns for his faggot; in which time Quarll, wi&s;hing the goodne&s;s of the in&s;ide might an&s;wer its outward beauty, cuts it open; and, finding it of a dull lu&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s, too flat for eating, imagined it might be u&s;ed with things of an acid and &s;harp ta&s;te; having therefore boiled &s;ome water, he puts it into a ve&s;&s;el, with a &s;ort of an herb which is of ta&s;te and nature of cre&s;&s;es, and &s;ome of the
<PB N="190" REF="030190_0195_0FE5070A11337910">
pomegranate, letting them infu&s;e &s;ome time, now and then &s;tirring it; which the monkey having taken notice of, did the &s;ame: but one very hot day, happening to lay the ve&s;&s;el in the &s;un, made it turn &s;our.</P>
<P>Quarll, who very much wanted vinegar in his &s;auces, was well plea&s;ed with the accident, and &s;o continued the &s;ouring of the liquor, which proving excellent, he made a five gal|lon ve&s;&s;el of it, having &s;everal which at times he found upon the rock.</P>
<P>Having now &s;tore of vinegar, and being a great lover of pickles, which he had learnt to make by &s;eeing his wife, who was an extraor|dinary cook, and made of all &s;orts every year; calling to mind he had often in his walks &s;een &s;omething like mu&s;hrooms, he makes it his bu&s;ine&s;s to look for &s;ome: thus he picked up a few, of which Beau&s;idelle (who followed him up and down) having taken notice, immedi|ately ranges about, and being nimbler footed than his ma&s;ter, and not obliged to &s;toop &s;o low, picked double the quantity in the &s;ame &s;pace of time; &s;o that he &s;oon had enough to &s;erve him till the next &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>His good &s;ucce&s;s in making that &s;ort of pic|kle encourages him to try another; and, hav|ing taken notice of a plant in the wood that bears a &s;mall green flower, which, before it is blown, looks like a caper, he gathers a few: and, their ta&s;te and flavour being no way di&s;|agreeable, judging that, when pickled, they would be plea&s;ant, he tries them, which, ac|cording to his mind, were full as good as the real ones; and gathers a &s;ufficient quantity,
<PB N="191" REF="030190_0196_0FE5070BEF685A40">
with the help of his attendant, &s;tocking him|&s;elf with two as plea&s;ant pickles as different &s;orts. But there is another which he admires above all: none, to his mind like the cucum|ber; and the i&s;land producing none, left him no room to hope for any; yet (as likene&s;s is a va&s;t help to imagination) if he could but find any thing, which ever &s;o little re&s;embles them in make, nature, or ta&s;te, it will plea&s;e his fancy: he therefore examines every kind of buds, blo&s;&s;oms, and &s;eeds; having at la&s;t &s;ound that of a wild par&s;nip, which being long and narrow, almo&s;t the bigne&s;s and make of a pickling cucumber, green and cri&s;p withal, full of a &s;mall flat &s;eed, not unlike that of the thing he would have it to be, he pickles &s;ome of them; which being of a colour, and near upon the make, he fancies them quite of the ta&s;te.</P>
<P>His beans being at that time large enough for the fir&s;t crop, he gathers &s;ome for his din|ner: the &s;hells being tender and of a delicate green, it came into his mind, they might be made to imitate French beans: <Q>they are, &s;aid he, near the nature, I can make them quite of the &s;hape, &s;o be they have the &s;ame &s;avour.</Q> Accordingly he cuts them in long narrow &s;lips, and pickles &s;ome; the other part he boils; and there being none to contradict their ta&s;te, they pa&s;&s;ed current for as good French beans as any that ever grew.</P>
<P>The di&s;appointment of having &s;omething more comfortable than water to drink being retrieved by producing, in the room thereof, wherewithal to make his eatables more delici|ous,
<PB N="192" REF="030190_0197_0FE5070D781675A0">
he proceeds in his fir&s;t project; and, tak|ing nece&s;&s;ary care to prevent that accident which intercepted &s;ucce&s;s in his fir&s;t undertak|ing, he accompli&s;hes his de&s;ign, and makes a liquor no wi&s;e inferior to the be&s;t cyder; &s;o that now he has both to revive and keep up his &s;pirits, as well as to plea&s;e his palate, and &s;uit his appetite.</P>
<P>Having now nothing to crave or wi&s;h for, but rather all motives for content; he lies down with a peaceable mind, no care or fear di&s;turbing his thoughts: his &s;leep is not inter|rupted with frightful fancies, but rather di|verted with plea&s;ant and diverting dreams; he is not &s;tartled at thunder or &s;torms, though ever &s;o terrible, his tru&s;t being on Providence, who at &s;undry times, and in various manners, has re&s;cued him from death, though apparently unavoidable; being for above thirty years mi|raculou&s;ly protected and maintained in a place &s;o remote from all human help and a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>

<P><HI>THE following Sketch of Univer&s;al Hi&s;tory was written by a gentleman for the u&s;e of two young ladies, and not intended for publication; but as it was de&s;igned to &s;up|ply what he thought was wanting to give the minds of children &s;ome idea of general hi&s;tory, and as it perfectly an&s;wered the purpo&s;e for which he compo&s;ed it, he has been induced to publi&s;h it, that others might reap the &s;ame advantage which tho&s;e have for who&s;e u&s;e it was particularly compo&s;ed.</HI></P>

<P>THE earlie&s;t information we have of the ac|tions of mankind is from the Holy Scriptures. We have there an account of the creation of the world, the de&s;truction of it by the Flood, the the renewal of mankind by the family of Noah, who were pre&s;erved in the Ark, and their increa&s;e and di&s;per&s;ion over the whole face of the earth. The Scriptures then proceed prin|cipally with the hi&s;tory of the de&s;cendants of Abraham, who&s;e great grand&s;on Jo&s;eph &s;et|tling in Egypt with his eleven brothers, they became, with their progeny, &s;laves to that powerful people. But increa&s;ing in proce&s;s of time, they migrated from thence and &s;ettled in

Pale&s;tine, after many wars, expelling the old inhabitants, who are called in our tran&s;lation of the Bible, Phili&s;tines. The de&s;cendants of Abraham &s;tyled them&s;elves I&s;raelites, or chil|dren of I&s;rael, from Jacob, the father of Jo&s;eph, who was al&s;o named I&s;rael. They divided the country among their twelve tribes, di&s;tingui&s;h|ed by the names of the twelve &s;ons of Jacob, from whom they were &s;everally de&s;cended. At fir&s;t they were governed by magi&s;trates called Judges; and afterwards by Kings. In the reign of Rehoboam, their fourth King, &s;on to Solo|mon, and grand&s;on to David, ten of the tribes revolted, under a leader named Jeroboam, leaving two tribes only, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Juda and Ben|jamin, under Rehoboam, who&s;e de&s;cendants were called Kings of Juda, from whence the name of Jews was derived; and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Jeroboam were called Kings of I&s;rael.</P>
<P>Several powerful nations aro&s;e in their neigh|bourhood, which all became in time &s;ubject to the empire of A&s;&s;yria. To &s;uch a formidable enemy the offspring of Abraham were an ea&s;y conque&s;t: the ten tribes of I&s;rael were carried into captivity, and their name no more heard of among the nations: the chief per&s;on among the Jews were al&s;o carried to Babylon, the ca|pital of A&s;&s;yria; but the people were permitted to remain at home under the dominion of their conquerors.</P>
<P>Soon after this a new power aro&s;e. The King of A&s;&s;yria turned his arms again&s;t the Medes and Per&s;ians. Camby&s;es, King of Per&s;ia, had married Mandane, daughter of A&s;tyages, King of Media. The fir&s;t attack of the A&s;&s;yrians
<PB N="196" REF="030190_0201_0FE4FE87A6B218F0">
was again&s;t Media. The Per&s;ians &s;ent Cyrus, &s;on of Camby&s;es and Mandane, at the head of an army, to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his uncle Cy|axares, who was then King. The invader was repelled, invaded in his turn, the King of A&s;&s;yria killed at the taking of Babylon, and the whole empire reduced under the dominion of the Medes and Per&s;ians; over both of whom Cyrus reigned, by marrying the only daugh|ter of his uncle Cyaxares. Thus was the Per|&s;ian empire founded.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ian empire extended over all the known parts of A&s;ia: and the ambition of Darius, a &s;ucce&s;&s;or though not a de&s;cendant of Cyrus, induced him to attempt the conque&s;t of part of Europe; but here he met with a &s;e|vere repul&s;e from the Grecian republics.</P>
<P>This &s;mall people, who inhabited a country of narrow extent, were not only able by their courage and military &s;kill to check this power|ful invader, but they had made &s;uch a profici|ency in wi&s;dom and arts, that we may now &s;ay, every attainment modern Europe has made in both is principally, if not &s;olely, derived from them. The origin of this &s;ingular people is very uncertain. The fir&s;t time they made any con&s;picuous figure in the annals of man|kind, was in the Trojan war, which has been rendered immortal by the poems of Homer. At that time they were divided into &s;mall king|doms, under limited monarchs; all of which, before the Per&s;ian inva&s;ion, were formed into republics.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ian King Darius de&s;pi&s;ed &s;uch feeble antagoni&s;ts; but both he and his &s;on Xerxes

&s;oon learned, by fatal experience, the advan|tage of valour and di&s;cipline over timid mul|titudes. After the lo&s;s of immen&s;e armies, the Kings of Per&s;ia contented them&s;elves with fo|menting the differences which began to ari&s;e among the Grecian republics, in which Athens and Sparta took the lead; and remaining anxi|ous &s;pectators of the bloody wars which they made with each other, when freed from the ap|prehen&s;ions of a foreign enemy.</P>
<P>While Greece was thus wa&s;ting her &s;trength in wars at home, great jealou&s;y was &s;till enter|tained le&s;t the common enemy (for &s;o the King of Per&s;ia was e&s;teemed) &s;hould take advantage of her weakne&s;s to accompli&s;h his ambitious de&s;igns, when a &s;torm unexpectedly bur&s;t on them from another quarter.</P>
<P>There was a country to the north of Greece, called Macedonia, which, though in many re&s;|pects congenial with it, was looked on as bar|barous (for the Greeks called all nations but them&s;elves barbarians). Macedonia was go|verned by an ab&s;olute King. Philip, Prince of Macedonia, happening, on &s;ome occa&s;ion, to be an ho&s;tage among the Greeks, had the ad|vantage, at the &s;ame time, of learning their art of war and &s;eeing their internal di&s;&s;entions. Profiting by this knowledge, when he &s;ucceeded to the throne of Macedonia, he &s;o contrived to embroil the affairs of Greece by corruption and intrigue, and by taking part, &s;ometimes with one party, and &s;ometimes with another, &s;o to weaken the whole, that, having bribed the chiefs of &s;ome of the republics to his intere&s;t, and totally defeated the Athenians and their
<PB N="198" REF="030190_0203_0FE508459CE199B8">
allies at the battle of Chaeronea, he rendered Greece entirely dependent on him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Knowing, however, the difficulty of keep|ing &s;uch a people in peaceable &s;ubjection, he planned the popular &s;cheme of an inva&s;ion of Per&s;ia; a&s;&s;embling for this purpo&s;e the whole force of Greece, and cau&s;ing him&s;elf to be ac|knowledged chief of the confederacy. In the mid&s;t of this undertaking he was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, and was &s;ucceeded in his power by his &s;on, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the appellation of Alexander the Great.</P>
<P>Alexander, immediately putting him&s;elf at the head of this formidable army, conquered the Per&s;ian empire with all its depedencies, and, penetrating to the banks of the Ganges, &s;ub|dued even part of that country &s;o well known to us by the name of the Ea&s;t Indies. But this immen&s;e empire was of &s;hort duration; for, on his return, he died at Babylon, as &s;ome &s;ay, by poi&s;on, as others by exce&s;&s;ive drinking, leaving his va&s;t dominions to be divided among his generals. A&s;ia, Egypt, and Greece, ex|hibited a continual &s;cene of war and de&s;olation; e&s;pecially Greece, where there were perpetual &s;truggles between the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Alexander for dominion, and the republics for liberty, till the whole was reduced to &s;ubjection by the power of Rome.</P>
<P>Rome, which makes &s;o con&s;picuous a figure in the hi&s;tory of mankind, aro&s;e from being a &s;mall &s;tate to the utmo&s;t extent of territory and power. At fir&s;t it was governed by Kings, who were expelled for their tyranny, and two annual magi&s;trates cho&s;en in their place; the&s;e,
<PB N="199" REF="030190_0204_0FE4FD6966F2BFB8">
with the &s;enate and a&s;&s;emblies of the people, formed the government, not unlike our Pre&s;i|dent, Senate, and Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives. The Romans &s;oon engaged in wars with the other &s;tates of Italy, all of which they finally conquer|ed; increa&s;ing by tho&s;e means not only their &s;trength but their military knowledge; and as many of the Italian &s;tates were Greek colonies, they had all the advantage of the Grecian art of war improved by their own experience. Being ma&s;ters of Italy, they turned their arms a|gain&s;t Sicily, which engaged them in a war with Carthage, a powerful &s;tate on the north of Afri|ca, who had colonies in that i&s;land. This war was pro&s;ecuted with various &s;ucce&s;s, till the per&s;everance and courage of the Romans pre|vailed, and Carthage was totally &s;ubdued.</P>
<P>To return to the affairs of Greece: Rome made the a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Greek republics a pre|tence for interfering in their di&s;putes, and fi|nally reduced both the oppre&s;&s;ors and the op|pre&s;&s;ed to an entire dependence on her&s;elf.</P>
<P>The armies of Rome now became invincible. Not only A&s;ia, Egypt, Greece, and the north|ern parts of Africa, were &s;ubdued, but &s;he extended her conque&s;ts to Spain, Gaul, and Britain.</P>
<P>Yet, amid the&s;e &s;plendid &s;cenes of victory abroad, Rome was torn to pieces by factions at home. At fir&s;t the &s;truggles were between the &s;enate and the people, till particular per|&s;ons obtaining power by holding long com|mands abroad, the names of the popular, or noble party were only u&s;ed as &s;kreens to the ambition of individuals. The la&s;t great con|te&s;t
<PB N="200" REF="030190_0205_0FE4FD6AEECC87A0">
was between Julius Cae&s;ar and Pompey; the fir&s;t of whom had commanded in the nor|thern, and the other in the ea&s;tern provinces. The deci&s;ive battle of Phar&s;alia, and the &s;ub|&s;equent death of Pompey, gave the whole Ro|man empire into the hands of Cae&s;ar. The &s;pirit of liberty, however, made one dying ef|fort. Cae&s;ar was &s;tabbed in the &s;enate hou&s;e, and an army rai&s;ed in defence of public free|dom. But after a &s;hort war, the veteran troops of Cae&s;ar, under command of Octa|vius, his nephew and adopted heir, Marcus Antonius, his friend, and Lepidus, one of his generals, defeated the army of the republic, and the three leaders divided the empire a|mong them.</P>
<P>Lepidus, being a weak man, was &s;oon de|po&s;ed; and M. Antonius, devoted to his plea|&s;ures, &s;hut him&s;elf up in Egypt with Cleopa|tra, the queen of that country. Octavius Cae|&s;ar, taking advantage of his indolence, en|croached on his provinces, and a war en&s;uing, Antonius was totally defeated at the naval bat|tle of Actium, &s;oon after which he killed him|&s;elf, and Octavius remained &s;ole ma&s;ter of the Roman empire, with the title of Emperor, and the name of Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar; and Rome, with its va&s;t territories, from this period be|came &s;ubject to the dominion of an arbitrary monarch.</P>

has little el&s;e to record than the characters of the Roman Emperors; and mankind were happy or mi&s;erable as their governors were mild or cruel. Perhaps the &s;tate of the human race was never more enviable than when &s;uch charac|ters as Titus, Trajan, or the Antonines, were ma&s;ters of the world. While under the govern|ment of &s;uch mon&s;ters, as Caligula, Nero, and Domitian, who &s;eemed to delight only in cru|elty, mankind were in the mo&s;t mi&s;erable &s;itu|ation, unable either to re&s;i&s;t the power of the tyrant, or e&s;cape from his dominions, as there was no country out of the limits of the Roman empire that was not inhabited by the mo&s;t &s;a|vage barbarians. It may not be ami&s;s here to mention, that, under the reign of Titus, tenth Emperor from Augu&s;tus, the city of Jeru&s;alem, after repeated rebellions, was finally de&s;troyed by the Romans, and the Jews di&s;per&s;ed, as they remain at this day: a &s;ingular in&s;tance of a peo|ple, who, having lo&s;t their country, &s;till main|tain, though &s;cattered over the face of the earth, their religion, their language, and their laws, the &s;ame as they were at a period far be|yond any antiquity to which the annals of any the mo&s;t ancient nation extend.</P>
<P>Though the barbarous tribes that bordered on the Roman empire were continually infe&s;t|ing the frontiers with ho&s;tilities, and gradually encroaching on its provinces, yet it &s;uffered no great diminution of territory till after the time of Con&s;tantine, who was the forty-fir&s;t Empe|ror in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from Augu&s;tus, and lived up|wards of three hundred years after him</P>
<P>During that period Chri&s;tianity had been
<PB N="202" REF="030190_0207_0FE4FD6DEB059C60">
gradually, though privately, extending it&s;elf. The profe&s;&s;ors of it had been cruelly per&s;ecuted by &s;ome of the Emperors, and tolerated by others; but Con&s;tantine was the fir&s;t Emperor who openly profe&s;&s;ed to be a Chri&s;tian, and from his time Chri&s;tianity became the e&s;tab|li&s;hed religion of the empire.</P>
<P>Con&s;tantine, from an ab&s;urd vanity, remov|ed the imperial &s;eat from Rome to a city of his own building, between the Mediterranean and Euxine Seas, which he called Con&s;tanti|nopolis, or the city of Con&s;tantine; and on his death he divided the empire between his &s;ons. From this time the Roman empire con|&s;i&s;ted of two parts; the one, who&s;e &s;eat conti|nued at Rome, was called the We&s;tern Empire; the other, who&s;e capital was Con&s;tantinople, was called the Ea&s;tern, and &s;ometimes the Gre|cian Empire</P>
<P>The empire, being thus divided, grew con|&s;equently weaker, and the inroads of the bar|barous nations more formidable. The Goths and Vandals attacked the We&s;tern empire. The Franks, a brave, though uncivilized peo|ple, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of Gaul, from whom it received the name of France. The Britons, on being abandoned by Rome to the inroads of the &s;avage tribes in the north of the i&s;land, call|ed in the Saxons to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, who &s;oon made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the whole, except the mountains of Wales and Scotland, which afforded an a&s;ylum to the ancient inhabitants. And Rome it&s;elf, under Augu&s;tulus, the la&s;t of its Emperors, was taken by Odoacer, King of the Heruli.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="030190_0208_0FE4FDB03577A710">
The Ea&s;tern empire was attacked by the Sa|racens, a fierce people, who had embraced the religion of Mahomet, an impo&s;tor and founder of a new &s;ect, who&s;e doctrine &s;oon &s;pread, and &s;till retains its influence in the Ea&s;t. This warlike race conquered Arabia, Syria, Egypt, and the northern coa&s;ts of Africa; but they were, in their turn, expelled by the Turks, a nation of Scythian origin, who adopted the re|ligion and manners of the vanqui&s;hed. The provinces of the Ea&s;tern empire gradually mouldered away, till it was at la&s;t confined to the walls of Con&s;tantinople. A final period was put to the Roman empire &s;o late as the year of our lord 1453, when Con&s;tantinople was taken by Mahomet, Sultan of the Turks, of who&s;e dominion it has ever &s;ince remained the capital. This happened under Con&s;tantine X. (the hundred and fourteenth Emperor in &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion from Augu&s;tus), who was killed in the a&s;&s;ault, 2200 years from the foundation of Rome, and during the reign of Henry VI. of England.</P>
<P>This was the real end of the Roman empire; but previous to this, &s;o early as the year of our Lord 800, there was a pretended revival of it in the per&s;on of Charlemagne, or Charles the Great.</P>
<P>The barbarous tribes who overturned the Roman empire, having very ob&s;cure notions of any religion, ea&s;ily adopted that of the people they conquered; and as the Saracens, and after them the Turks, who ravaged the Ea&s;t, embra|ced the errours of Mahomet, which they found e&s;tabli&s;hed in Arabia, &s;o the northern barba|rians
<PB N="204" REF="030190_0209_0FE4FDB215AC1498">
who conquered Gaul, Germany, and Italy, were ea&s;ily converted to the faith of Chri&s;t: and the Bi&s;hop of Rome, who a&s;&s;u|med the title of Pope, and Patriarch of the Roman church, &s;oon obtained the &s;ame influ|ence over the Heruli, and the Lombards, who &s;ucceeded them, as he had over the Romans under their Chri&s;tian Emperors. But De&s;ide|rius, the Lombard King of Italy, oppo&s;ing the ambition of Pope Stephen III. the Pope called Charlemagne, King of France, to his aid, who dethroned De&s;iderius and conquered Italy: as a reward for which, the Pope crowned him Emperor at Rome; and Charlemagne becom|ing afterwards ma&s;ter of Germany, and divid|ing his dominions between his &s;ons, that to whom Germany fell retained the title of Roman Em|peror, which his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors &s;till continue to a&s;&s;ume: and the head of a limited elective mo|narchy, who re&s;ides at Vienna, now calls him|&s;elf Emperor of the Romans, and takes the names of Cae&s;ar and Augu&s;tus.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time that Charlemagne made the&s;e conque&s;ts on the continent of Europe, Egbert united the &s;even provinces into which the Saxons had divided all the &s;outhern part of Britain (except Wales) into one kingdom by the name of England.</P>
<P>The&s;e barbarians were no &s;ooner &s;ettled in their conque&s;ts, and in &s;ome degree civilized, than a fre&s;h inundation poured in from the north, under the name of Danes and Normans, and, committing the &s;ame ravages on the new po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors which they had committed on the old inhabitants, at la&s;t fixed them&s;elves, part in
<PB N="205" REF="030190_0210_0FE5076CF05B6118">
Germany, part in England, and part in that province of France which yet retains the name of Normandy; and, as their predece&s;&s;ors had done, &s;oon a&s;&s;umed the religion and manners of the vanqui&s;hed.</P>
<P>As the&s;e northern nations &s;ettled over all the we&s;tern parts of Europe, which were divided by them into many &s;tates, &s;o the &s;ame form of government, derived from the &s;ame origin, was e&s;tabli&s;hed in them all. The leader of each army of invaders was con&s;idered as King, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure as proprietor of the conquered territory. But as it was nece&s;&s;ary to have an army ready at all times to repel new invaders, and guard again&s;t the encroachment of neigh|bours, the King, or General, parceled out his land among the &s;uperior officers, who, by way of acknowledgment, were bound to furni&s;h him with a proportionable a&s;&s;i&s;tance of men and arms in time of war, and to attend his councils in time of peace. And the&s;e leaders, to enable them&s;elves to command the requi&s;ite number of troops which they were to furni&s;h, allotted part of their lands again to the infe|rior officers and &s;oldiers, on condition that they &s;hould attend them to the wars when &s;ummoned by the King or the Lord Paramount. And this, which is called the feudal &s;y&s;tem, is the origin of that limited monarchy, which, till within the&s;e two centuries, was e&s;tabli&s;hed through|out the greate&s;t part of Europe, and which Great Britain has pre&s;erved to this time.</P>
<P>Civilization had as yet made but a &s;mall progre&s;s: the writings of the ancient Greeks and Romans, which are now the models of
<PB N="206" REF="030190_0211_0FE5077146754648">
every thing great and elegant, were confined to the hands of a bigoted clergy; and war was the &s;ole delight of princes and nobles too igno|rant even to write their names.</P>
<P>This warlike &s;pirit, however, was attended by &s;ome good con&s;equences: for the Saracens, who had over-run the ea&s;tern parts of Europe, began to turn their arms again&s;t the &s;outhern parts of we&s;tern Europe: they threatened Italy, invaded the &s;outh part of France, their African colonies had made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the be&s;t part of Spain, and nothing le&s;s than the warlike turn of its inhabitants could have pre|vented all Europe from becoming a prey to the&s;e fierce barbarians, and the con&s;equent rudene&s;s and de&s;poti&s;m which ever have attend|ed the religion of Mahomet wherever it pre|vails.</P>
<P>The Chri&s;tian Doctrine, corrupted as it was by the Church of Rome, had yet a tendency to poli&s;h and &s;often the manners of its profe&s;&s;ors; and even the power of the Pope, who&s;e &s;upre|macy was acknowledged by &s;o many independ|ent and turbulent princes, though often u&s;ed for the purpo&s;es of &s;uper&s;tition, was &s;ometimes al&s;o in&s;trumental in &s;topping the progre&s;s, or mitigating the horrors of war.</P>
<P>A new &s;pirit of enterprize now took place in Europe. As the zeal for Chri&s;tianity increa&s;|ed, the warlike princes and nobles who pro|fe&s;&s;ed it beheld with indignation the &s;cene of all the miracles, recorded both in the Old and New Te&s;tament, in the hands of infidels. The Pope encouraged this religious fervour; and va&s;t armies were poured forth to re&s;cue the&s;e
<PB N="207" REF="030190_0212_0FE5077D1709CBF0">
con&s;ecrated &s;eats from the Mahometans. But, after deluging the plains of Pale&s;tine with Chri|&s;tian blood, and making a conque&s;t of Jeru&s;a|lem, which could not be retained, the votaries of Mahomet remained, and &s;till remain, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors of that country which is commonly called the Holy Land.</P>
<P>Some advantage, however, was derived from the&s;e enterprizes. Part of the immen&s;e armies that pa&s;&s;ed from Europe to A&s;ia, took their rout by Con&s;tantinople; and though, to their &s;hame it mu&s;t be owned, that while their end was to re&s;cue part of A&s;ia from the power of in|fidels, they them&s;elves committed deva&s;tation in the dominions of the only Chri&s;tian Prince in the ea&s;t of Europe, yet they were &s;truck with the magnificence of the court of Con&s;tantino|ple, where &s;ome relics of the &s;plendour of the Roman empire were &s;till pre&s;erved. This in|troduced a ta&s;te for the arts among the Princes of we&s;tern Europe; and on the Turks putting an end to the Ea&s;tern empire by the capture of Con&s;tantinople, the learned men of that city migrated into France, Italy, Germany, and Britain, and introduced there a knowledge of Grecian literature.</P>
<P>Happily for the revival of learning, Leo X. who was then Pope, was as de&s;irous of extend|ing literature as &s;ome of his predece&s;&s;ors had been of &s;preading ignorance; he therefore en|tertained the Grecian exiles, and encouraged letters among the clergy. At this time Europe was in a more pacific &s;tate: England breathed after the long wars between York and Lanca&s;|ter: France, from being divided among a num|ber
<PB N="208" REF="030190_0213_0FE5077EC25077E0">
of independent nobles, each able to awe the titular King, became one powerful monar|chy: the Moors were driven out of Spain, and that whole country, which had formed many &s;eparate kingdoms, was united by the marriage of Ferdinand of Ca&s;tile and I&s;abella of Arra|gon: Germany was one large republic of Prin|ces, of whom the Emperor was the head; and Italy was divided into many &s;mall &s;tates, the chief of which were the kingdom of Naples, and the commonwealth of Venice.</P>
<P>The Pope now found his authority &s;haken. As literature advanced, a &s;pirit of inquiry took place, and the mon&s;trous errours grafted by the church of Rome on the pure religion of Chri&s;t began to be perceived. Luther and Calvin publi&s;hed their opinions on this &s;ubject, and had many followers, who, from prote&s;ting a|gain&s;t the errours of the church of Rome, ob|tained the name of Prote&s;tants; and their opi|nions prevailed in England, the northern coun|tries, and part of Germany and Switzerland.</P>
<P>About this time the art of navigation being greatly improved, a large continent was di&s;|covered in the we&s;t, called America. Many colonies were &s;oon formed there by the Engli&s;h, French, and Spaniards, which have occa&s;ioned frequent wars among tho&s;e nations. From this period, as commerce has increa&s;ed, mankind have become more civilized. Religion and politics for a time filled both England and France with inte&s;tine commotions. Charles I. of England was brought to the &s;caffold by his &s;ubjects, and Henry IV. of France was &s;tab|ed by an enthu&s;ia&s;t. By the arts of Lewis

XIV. France was brought to be an ab&s;olute mo|narchy, without any legal re&s;traint, indeed, on the power of the crown.</P>
<P>The la&s;t king of this potent empire was Lewis XVI. who was born Augu&s;t 23, 1754, married to Maria Antoniette of Au&s;tria, May 16, 1770; a&s;cended to the throne upon the death of his grandfather Lewis XV. May 10, 1774; and was crowned at Rheims, June 12, 1775.</P>
<P>About this period Great Britain, through a mi&s;taken policy, differed with her colonies in North America, now the UNITED STATES; and after a fruitle&s;s and bloody conte&s;t for &s;ome years, was compelled to acknowledge them free and independent.</P>
<P>A revolution commences in France July 14th, 1789&mdash;Royalty aboli&s;hed 10th. Augu&s;t 1792&mdash;Lewis XVI. ordered for trial to the bar of the convention 11th. December&mdash;Sentence of death decreed him, 19th. January 1793, and guillotined 21&s;t. January. His Queen, Maria Antoniette tried and executed 16th. October 1793.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of France and Great Britain, eternal rivals in glory and intere&s;t, for the two la&s;t centuries, is in fact the hi&s;tory of the world. During that period, there has been no war of any con&s;equence between European powers in any part of the world in which they have not acted a principal part; and a war between them extends its influence from the &s;hores of Amer|ica to the banks of the Ganges. They have been con&s;tantly ready to attack each other on the mo&s;t trivial occa&s;ions, and even their trea|ties of peace have &s;eemed rather ce&s;&s;ations of

ho&s;tilities for the purpo&s;e of renewing them with greater vigour, than any permanent re|conciliation. When and how the pre&s;ent fruitle&s;s and wanton quarrel (on the part of Great Britain) may terminate, time mu&s;t deve|lope; for the &s;ake of humanity we wi&s;h it at an end, and that the future conte&s;ts of all-mankind may be, who &s;hall excel mo&s;t in arts of peace and the pur&s;uits of literature!</P>

<HEAD>THE ELEPHANT.</HEAD>
<P>NEXT to Man, the Elephant is the mo&s;t re&s;|pectable of the Almighty's creatures. In &s;ize he exceeds all other terre&s;trial animals; and by his under&s;tanding he approaches nearly to the human &s;pecies. His temper is naturally gentle. Even while wild in the fore&s;ts he thir&s;ts not after blood, nor does he u&s;e his va&s;t &s;trength, except in defending him&s;elf or pro|tecting his companions. His favourite food is rice, roots, and herbs; he abhors fi&s;h and fle&s;h. When he finds a plentiful pa&s;ture, he makes u&s;e of a particular cry, which gives notice to his comrades to come and partake of the dain|ties which he has found. An invitation which they readily obey, to the great lo&s;s of the own|er of the land.&mdash;The Elephant is caught and tamed without difficulty. His love of &s;ociety renders him ea&s;y to be allured into a &s;nare by others of his own &s;pecies, who have been edu|cated
<PB N="217" REF="030190_0222_0FE507A200091438">
for that purpo&s;e. Two of the&s;e, after he is in confinement, con&s;tantly attend all his motions, and, when he is not di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ub|mit, compel him by &s;triking him with their trunks to obedience. Very &s;oon, however, his own a&s;toni&s;hing judgment convinces him that no harm, is meant to him, and that his efforts towards re&s;i&s;tance are all in vain. In con&s;e|quence of this, he applies him&s;elf to learn his duty, and becomes the milde&s;t and mo&s;t obe|dient of all dome&s;tic animals. He &s;oon learns to comprehend &s;igns. He di&s;tingui&s;hes the tone of command, of anger, and of approbation. He never mi&s;takes the voice of his ma&s;ter, re|ceives his orders with attention, and executes them with prudence and eagerne&s;s, but with|out precipitation. He &s;eems to take plea&s;ure in being covered with gilded harne&s;s and gay hou&s;ings. He draws carriages, waggons, ar|tillery, &amp;c. with evenne&s;s and good humour, provided he be not treated ill, unde&s;ervedly, and that the people who are employed with him have the air of being plea&s;ed with his be|haviour. His conductor (&s;tyled his Cornac) generally rides on the Elephant's neck and car|ries in his hand a &s;harp iron, with which, when nece&s;&s;ary, he pricks the creature's head or ears, to make him move fa&s;ter; but this is &s;eldom put in practice, &s;ince words are always &s;uffici|ent, provided that the Cornac has had time to acquire the Elephant's confidence; after which the bea&s;t's attachment and affection become &s;o &s;trong, that one is actually recorded to have died of grief, becau&s;e in a fit of pa&s;&s;ion he had killed his keeper.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="030190_0223_0FE507A843977AB8">
Before the invention of gunpowder, Ele|phants were u&s;ed in war, and have often by their efforts decided the fate of battles. On their backs they carried &s;mall towers which held five or &s;ix armed men; and from their trunks hung heavy chains, which they were taught to &s;wing around them in order to break the ranks of the enemy's army. But now that fire is the chief in&s;trument of death in battles, the Ele|phant, as he is &s;ubject to dread both the noi&s;e and the flame of fire-arms, would be dangerous to his own party. He is &s;till employed by Euro|peans in the Ea&s;t for the purpo&s;e of tran&s;port|ing the baggage of their troops, and by the In|dian princes, for carrying their women in large cages covered with green branches of trees.</P>
<P>Elephants are more numerous in Africa than in A&s;ia, the only two parts of the world where they are, naturally, found. In Africa they live uncontrouled, for they de&s;pi&s;e the ne|groes as a &s;et of un&s;kilful, weak beings, who have neither &s;trength nor art enough to reduce them to &s;lavery. Tho&s;e of the A&s;iatic i&s;land, Ceylon, are looked upon as the large&s;t, bolde&s;t, and mo&s;t intelligent of the whole &s;pecies.</P>
<P>The Elephant is &s;trong in proportion to his va&s;t bulk. He can with ea&s;e carry from three to four thou&s;and weight; and on his tu&s;ks a|lone he can &s;upport upwards of one thou&s;and pounds. The quickne&s;s of his paces, when the immen&s;e weight of his body is con&s;idered, is a proof of his amazing &s;trength. His u&s;ual walk equals the common trot of a hor&s;e; and he can run as fa&s;t as a hor&s;e can gallop. He is gene|rally permitted to walk when loaded, and can
<PB N="219" REF="030190_0224_0FE507B083899BF0">
with ea&s;e perform fifty miles in a day, but, when pu&s;hed, can go almo&s;t twice as far. He will do as much work as &s;ix &s;trong hor&s;es, but his price is immen&s;e, and the charge of main|taining him very great indeed. An Elephant who has been properly di&s;ciplined is worth from four to five hundred guineas; and he will eat in a day above a hundred pounds of rice, be&s;ides vegetables. In India all barrels, &s;acks, and bales of goods are carried from place to place by Elephants, and if their necks and trunks have no more room for burthens, they will carry an additional weight in their mouth. The Elephant unites &s;agacity with &s;trength, and never injures any thing committed to his charge, be it ever &s;o delicate. He will carry each particular parcel to a boat in his trunk without wetting it; he will range each in order, will try whether each lies firm, and will actual|ly place &s;tones where nece&s;&s;ary to prevent ca&s;ks from rolling from their proper &s;tation.</P>
<P>The trunk (or probo&s;cis) of this wonderful animal ought to be particularly de&s;cribed. It extends it&s;elf con&s;iderably beyond his mouth, and is terminated by a protuberance which per|forms all the offices of, and is by no means un|like to, a finger: with this he can lift the &s;mall|e&s;t piece of money from the ground; he can untie knots; he can turn keys, pu&s;h back bolts, or loo&s;en &s;traps from buckles; and with this he can gratify his &s;en&s;e of &s;melling (which there is rea&s;on to believe to be very exqui&s;ite) by ga|thering flowers, and conveying them to his no&s;e, which, as well as his finger, compo&s;es a part of his trunk. The orange tree, in who&s;e
<PB N="220" REF="030190_0225_0FE507B27AD12CB8">
flowers he delights, both for their ta&s;te and &s;mell, is an object of his mo&s;t eager pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>The Elephant, when old, &s;uffers great in|convenience from the increa&s;ing &s;ize of his large teeth or tu&s;ks; to remedy this evil, his natural &s;agacity prompts him to make two holes in a tree, if wild, or if tamed, in a wall, to &s;upport them, and prevent the va&s;t fatigue which his neck endures from their weight. As great part of his &s;kin is tender and delicate, he &s;uffers much from the bites and &s;tings of flies. To prevent this inconvenience, he puts in prac|tice all the means which his peculiar good &s;en&s;e &s;ugge&s;ts: if he cannot keep the in&s;ects away by bru&s;hing them off with branches of trees and whi&s;ps of &s;traw, he then wets all the mo&s;t ex|po&s;ed parts of his body, and gathering du&s;t with his trunk, &s;preads it carefully over each un|guarded place.</P>
<P>The height of the creature in his natural &s;tate is generally between ten and fourteen feet; but in captivity his growth is con&s;iderably checked.</P>
<P>He is nice in many particulars, abhors bad &s;mells, and, probably on that account, dreads the &s;ight, or even the cry of a hog. In eating, let him be ever &s;o hungry, he will fa&s;t until he has nicely examined his victuals, and &s;eparated from them every particle of dirt, du&s;t, or other uncleanline&s;s.</P>
<P>Both ancient and modern writers dwell with peculiar plea&s;ure on the innumerable in&s;tances of in&s;tinct, or rather &s;omewhat which ap|proaches very nearly to rea&s;on, in this noble animal; but of the&s;e we &s;hall &s;elect a few of the be&s;t atte&s;ted.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="030190_0226_0FE507B412471B90">
An Elephant had been provoked by ill u&s;age to kill his conductor.&mdash;The widow, who had been a witne&s;s to the horrid &s;cene, ru&s;hed with her two infant children to the enraged animal.&mdash;<Q>Here, &s;aid &s;he, &s;ince you have &s;lain my hu&s;band, take my life too, and complete your bloody bu&s;ine&s;s by de&s;troying the&s;e poor babes!</Q> The bea&s;t, apparently hurt at his own exce&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion, lo&s;t at once his re&s;ent|ment, and taking the elde&s;t of the children in his trunk, adopted him, as it were for his go|vernor, and would never &s;uffer any other per&s;on to mount his neck.</P>
<P>If the Elephant is revengeful when ill treated, he is truly grateful to tho&s;e who u&s;e him kindly. A &s;oldier in the Ea&s;t Indies had been accu&s;tom|ed, when he received his pay, to treat one of the&s;e &s;en&s;ible animals with arrack; one day, having him&s;elf partaken too largely of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> liquor, he e&s;caped from a detachment who had been ordered to convey him to pri&s;on, and tak|ing &s;helter beneath the creature whom he had obliged, he fell fa&s;t a&s;leep. His pur&s;uers find|ing that the Elephant had taken him under his protection, left him, and he, when he awoke, &s;ober, and frightened at his &s;ituation, was con|&s;oled by the care&s;&s;es of the good-natured ani|mal, who &s;eemed &s;en&s;ible of the terrours which his benefactor felt, and willing to remove them. An Elephant, in a battle fought not many years ago, having been driven to di&s;traction by the pain of his wounds, ran about the field making the mo&s;t hideous cries. A wounded &s;oldier of his own party lay ju&s;t in his way and naturally expected in&s;tant de&s;truction. But the

poor tortured animal, con&s;cious that he owed none of his pain to the &s;oldier, took him ten|derly up with his trunk, and, having placed him out of the common path, continued his route. This anecdote points out the &s;pecies of excellent rea&s;oning in the Elephant, which pre|vents him from being provoked, even by the mo&s;t accute pain, to hurt &s;uch as have not in|jured him: but he mu&s;t not be wantonly in|&s;ulted; and even the mo&s;t trifling affront may expo&s;e the giver to a fatal recompence. An Elephant which was kept at Ver&s;ailles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A palace about ten miles from Paris, where the Kings of France u&s;ed to have a collection of curious bea&s;ts, birds, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE> not many years pa&s;t, appeared to know when he was mocked by any per&s;on, and &s;eldom failed to revenge the in&s;ult. A man deceived him, by pretending to throw eatables into his mouth. The animal took his opportunity to knock him down with his trunk, and treated him &s;o &s;e|verely that he &s;carcely e&s;caped with life. Ano|ther time a painter, in order to draw him with his trunk elevated, employed his &s;ervant to throw, or pretend to throw, fruit into the Elephant's mouth; the deceitful part of this order was re&s;ented by the creature with &s;uch ex|cellent &s;agacity, that in&s;tead of revenging him|&s;elf on the &s;ervant, (who appears to have been within his reach,) he &s;quirted &s;uch a quantity of water from his trunk at the ma&s;ter, (whom he judiciou&s;ly di&s;cerned to be the contriver of his mortification,) that it utterly ruined the pa|per on which his work was going forward.</P>
<P>It is recorded, and univer&s;ally credited, of an Elephant, that as he was pa&s;&s;ing along a
<PB N="223" REF="030190_0228_0FE507C1E59765D8">
&s;treet in the city of Delhi, he thru&s;t his trunk in at the window of a room where a tailor &s;ate employed on a rich habit.&mdash;This man, di&s;|plea&s;ed at being interrupted in his work, cau&s;ed the animal to withdraw in great ha&s;te, by pricking him with a needle; provoked at this treatment, the Elephant, who knew that he &s;hould pa&s;s by the &s;ame &s;treet again the next day, it being the u&s;ual road to his watering place, took care to be prepared for his enemy, by laying in a &s;tore of dirty water; this he emptied from his trunk at the &s;ame window, and completed his revenge, by thoroughly &s;poiling the &s;ilk on which the tailor was at work.</P>
<P>Accounts hardly credible, although perfect|ly well atte&s;ted, are told of the Elephant's &s;en|&s;ibility to reproach. One in particular, having been upbraided by his keeper, as a poor indo|lent creature, for having failed in an effort to &s;et afloat a ve&s;&s;el which lay a&s;hore, an attempt which was really beyond his &s;trength, was &s;o much hurt by the charge, that he made a new trial, &s;ucceeded in it, but fell in&s;tantly dead, from the damage which he had received in con|&s;equence of the exertion.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid before, that mild as the Ele|phant naturally is, he is not to be trifled with. One of the&s;e animals having, with great &s;aga|city, carried the iron ve&s;&s;el in which he u&s;ually drank, to the &s;mith's &s;hop where it u&s;ed to be repaired; the workman mended it but by halves; the Elephant carried it back, and was &s;everely reproached by his ma&s;ter; who made him comprehend, by &s;howing him how the
<PB N="224" REF="030190_0229_0FE507C379600CA0">
water ran out of the ve&s;&s;el, that it needed a farther repair. The animal, as much hurt as if <HI>he</HI> had been accountable for the workman's neglect, &s;natching the ve&s;&s;el out of the owner's hand, half full of water as it was, carried it in ha&s;te to the &s;hop; and as &s;oon as the per&s;on who had done his work &s;o ill appeared, the Elephant di&s;charged the water in his face, as a puni&s;hment for his mi&s;behaviour.</P>
<P>Hitherto, Mr. Buffon has &s;upplied what has been &s;aid of the Elephant; what follows, is chiefly taken from Sparman's account of the Cape of Good Hope.</P>
<P>A female Elephant lo&s;t her young one. It &s;eems, that it had fallen into the hands of a party of the native Hottentots, who had killed and devoured it. The mother, the next night, having &s;ome how (probably by the &s;cent) di&s;|covered the place of its death, attacked the kraal or village in the dark, and utterly de&s;troy|ed it, by beating down all the huts, and tramp|ling all the plantations to pieces. And here it may be properly remarked, that the Hotten|tots eagerly &s;eek the fle&s;h of the Elephant to eat it; which is not the ca&s;e with any other Af|rican or A&s;iatic people, that we read of.</P>
<P>In the country round the Cape, the Elephant is pur&s;ued, not to be tamed, but to be &s;lain for the &s;ake of the ivory which his teeth afford. In this chace, the danger to the hunter is great; but the hopes of a large profit (&s;ometimes as much as 300 gilders, or about twenty-&s;ix pounds, by a &s;ingle Elephant) make him clo&s;e his eyes to all perils. He mu&s;t be very atten|tive to approach the animal on the &s;ide whence
<PB N="225" REF="030190_0230_0FE507C507002510">
the wind blows; for &s;hould he be di&s;cerned by his piercing &s;cent, the Elephant ru&s;hes on him; nor can any thing &s;ave him, except a &s;teep hill or wood, either of which circum&s;tances incum|ber the bea&s;t, and &s;ave the &s;port&s;man. The bullet which is de&s;tined to de&s;troy this immen&s;e creature, mu&s;t be made of a proportionable mixture of tin and lead; the piece from whence it is di&s;charged, is generally one of tho&s;e mu&s;|quets which were in u&s;e about one hundred and eighty years ago, &s;o &s;trong and heavy, as to require a re&s;t to &s;upport it when levelled. And yet, when the&s;e enormous pieces are deeply loaded, and &s;upplied with proper balls, an Ele|phant has been known to receive eight wounds in his body, before he was deprived of life.</P>

<HEAD>THE LION.</HEAD>
<P>THE Lion, though inferior in &s;ize to &s;eve|ral other animals which inhabit the &s;ame coun|tries with him&s;elf, is &s;o &s;uperior in the united qualities of &s;trength, addre&s;s, and courage, as to have obtained the highe&s;t rank among&s;t the brute creation. Even the cumbrous Elephant, and the robu&s;t Buffalo, are conquered by this lordly bea&s;t, who proudly &s;ubdues and preys upon all, but is him&s;elf the prey of none. Nor is his courage le&s;s remarkable than his &s;trength. The fierce Lion, who has been u&s;ed to con|quer, and is ignorant of the &s;uperior power of man, will &s;ometimes ru&s;h upon a caravan which
<PB N="226" REF="030190_0231_0FE507C86A25EAC0">
is travelling through the de&s;erts; and &s;uch is his contempt of danger, that when he is re|pul&s;ed, he does not turn his back and endea|vour to e&s;cape, but retreats &s;ighting, and de|fending him&s;elf again&s;t the attacks of his ene|mies. The large&s;t Lions are about eight or nine feet in length, and three or four feet in height: their colour is yellow on the back, and a du&s;ky white on the &s;ides and belly. The male Lion is adorned with a large flowing mane, which grows larger as he advances in years; but the female is without this ornament, and is about one-fourth le&s;s in &s;ize. In general the Lione&s;s is much more docile and gentle than the Lion; but when &s;he has young, &s;he becomes &s;till fiercer than he, and will attack a number of armed men in defence of her whelps. Her care to &s;ecure them from di&s;co|very is &s;hown before their birth; &s;he retires to the lea&s;t frequented places, and when they are brought forth, &s;he is &s;o careful to pre&s;erve them, that when &s;he leaves them to procure food, &s;he carefully bru&s;hes away the marks of her feet with her tail, that her young may not be di&s;co|vered by the prints of her &s;teps. The Lion is an inhabitant of warm climates, and is never found in the frozen regions of the North. In|deed the &s;trength and fiercene&s;s of this terrible animal appear to be greatly increa&s;ed by the heat of the climate he inhabits; and there is a remarkable difference between the ferocity of tho&s;e Lions which breathe the temperate air of lofty mountains and of tho&s;e which dwell in the &s;andy and &s;corching plains. The American Lions, which are natives of a milder climate, have neither the fiercene&s;s, the &s;trength, nor
<PB N="227" REF="030190_0232_0FE507D1444DDE20">
the courage of tho&s;e born under the fervid rays of an Indian or African &s;un; nor are they a|dorned with a mane. Indeed, their differing in &s;o many re&s;pects has made &s;everal Naturali&s;ts very doubtful whether or not they were of the true Lion &s;pecies.</P>
<P>Though the Lion is naturally an inhabitant of hot countries, he can &s;ub&s;i&s;t a long time in more temperate climates. Several have lived during many years in Europe, and &s;ome have brought forth young, and attained to a con&s;i|derable age, in Britain. The time which has been &s;uppo&s;ed the u&s;ual term of their lives is between twenty and twenty-five years. Their numbers have been greatly le&s;&s;ened by the in|crea&s;e of the human &s;pecies, and the invention of fire-arms; and though many &s;till inhabit the &s;outhern parts of Africa and A&s;ia, and are very fierce and dreadful, yet they are no longer found in very large numbers. Tho&s;e Lions which dwell near the villages of India or Bar|bary, have &s;o often experienced the &s;uperior powers of man, that they have lo&s;t much of their native fiercene&s;s, and, if forced by hunger or provoked by the attacks of men, they attempt to a&s;&s;ault them, they approach with great cau|tion and &s;igns of fear. It is however a&s;&s;erted, that if this fierce bea&s;t has conquered, and has once ta&s;ted human fle&s;h, he will never after|wards prey with equal plea&s;ure upon any other animal.</P>
<P>When the Lion prepares to attack his prey, he generally makes u&s;e of &s;tratagem to en&s;ure his &s;ucce&s;s He lies in wait near the &s;prings where the animals go to drink, couched upon
<PB N="228" REF="030190_0233_0FE507D2CF385CC0">
his belly, darts upon them as they pa&s;s, and &s;eldom mi&s;&s;es his aim, though he frequently makes a leap twelve or fifteen feet in length. As he neither hears nor &s;ees very well, though he has the faculty of &s;eeing in the night, he is known to employ great watchfulne&s;s to procure his prey; and is obliged to keep at a con&s;ide|rable di&s;tance from the animal he means to at|tack, who would, if he came nearer, &s;oon di&s;|cover him by his &s;trong &s;cent. Springs and fountains are very agreeable to him, not only on account of their being frequented by other animals, but al&s;o from the great thir&s;tine&s;s of the Lion; for though he is able to &s;upport great hunger, he &s;uffers much from thir&s;t. When he attacks the Buffalo, he ru&s;hes upon him un&s;een, fa&s;tens his two fore paws upon his mouth and no&s;trils, and does not re&s;ign his hold till the animal is quite &s;trangled; he then &s;ometimes tears out the entrails that he may remove the body with more ea&s;e, and drags it to a retreat, where he may enjoy his fea&s;t in &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>All animals appear to have a natural dread of the Lion, and travellers have frequently been acquainted with their approach by the unea&s;ine&s;s of their cattle. The oxen and hor|&s;es &s;igh deeply, and &s;how every appearance of terrour, and the dogs creep clo&s;e to the feet of their ma&s;ters, and are afraid even to bark. At the &s;ound of his terrible voice the affrighted animals run wildly about to avoid him; but as he lays his mouth to the ground when he utters his deep continued roars, the &s;ound is &s;o dif|fu&s;ed, that they know not whence it proceeds,
<PB N="229" REF="030190_0234_0FE507D45A83AC88">
and they frequently advance to the very &s;pot where he &s;tands ready to devour them. But terrible as the Lion is to every other animal, he is &s;o inferior to man, that he is not only fre|quently taken in toils which are formed to de|&s;troy him, but is even hunted for amu&s;ement. The inhabitants of the &s;outhern parts of Afri|ca, mounted on hor&s;eback, frequently pur&s;ue and kill him, and they e&s;teem his fle&s;h both plea&s;ant and nouri&s;hing. His &s;kin, which in &s;ome countries has been u&s;ed as a royal mantle, is however regarded as very inferior in real u&s;e|fulne&s;s to the hide of an Ox.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the Cape of Good Hope, who are much infe&s;ted by Lions, which devour their flocks, make u&s;e of many artifices to de|&s;troy them. In travelling in the night, they are obliged to be pretty con&s;tantly upon their guard again&s;t this fierce animal, though he &s;el|dom attacks them in the day, except he is very hungry, or greatly provoked. A Hottentot, who was travelling to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, ob&s;erved that he was followed by one of the&s;e formidable animals, which kept &s;everal yards behind him, but advanced with exactly the &s;ame &s;peed. Sen&s;ible of the cunning of the Lion, who &s;eldom attacks his prey openly, the traveller concluded that he only waited for the approach of darkne&s;s to ru&s;h upon him; and as he was without weapons, and at a great di&s;|tance from any habitation, he was in the ut|mo&s;t danger of being torn in pieces by his pur|&s;uer. His knowledge of the manners of the animal, and his own ingenuity, furni&s;hed him, however, with the means to e&s;cape. He care|fully
<PB N="230" REF="030190_0235_0FE507D7E2B98AA8">
&s;ought for &s;ome rocky place, which was level at the top, and had a deep precipice on one &s;ide; and &s;eating him&s;elf on the brink, he prepared for the part he was to act to &s;ave him|&s;elf from de&s;truction, while his enemy lay couched upon the ground, and &s;teadily ob&s;erv|ing him. As &s;oon as it became du&s;k, the Hottentot, gently &s;liding forwards, let him&s;elf down upon a &s;mall part of the rock which pro|jected ju&s;t below him, and which was ju&s;t large enough to &s;upport him; but in order to de|ceive the Lion, he rai&s;ed his &s;tick, upon which he had placed his hat and cloak, and made a gentle motion with it ju&s;t above his head, at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the edge of the mountain. This &s;tratagem had the de&s;ired &s;ucce&s;s. The Lion crept gently towards the &s;tick, which he mi&s;took for the man, and then bounded upon it, with &s;o exact an aim as to fall down the precipice clo&s;e to the &s;pot where the Hottentot had placed the &s;nare.</P>
<P>There are few di&s;po&s;itions &s;o &s;avage that they may not be tamed by kindne&s;s, and even the ferocious Lion has afforded the &s;tronge&s;t proofs of attachment and gratitude for the benefits he has received. The celebrated Earl of Peter|borough, when a boy, was pre&s;ented with a young Lion, which he greatly delighted to ca|re&s;s and to feed; and the animal became &s;o tame as to &s;uffer his lord&s;hip to play with him, with the familiarity of a brother. They grew up together, and their intimacy had continued &s;everal years, when the Earl was appointed by Queen Ann to the command of her army in Spain. His promotion did not, however, make
<PB N="231" REF="030190_0236_0FE507E1D5B9AD10">
him forgetful of his old friend the Lion; he gave &s;trict orders to his hou&s;ekeeper to take care of his playfellow. The animal &s;howed great concern at the ab&s;ence of his lord&s;hip, &s;en&s;ibly pined for his lo&s;s, and refu&s;ed his food; and the Earl, in order to pre&s;erve his life, or|dered him to be pre&s;ented to her Maje&s;ty, in hopes that the &s;ociety of the other animals in the Tower would make him forget his old friend. A long time pa&s;&s;ed before the return of the Earl from Spain, who brought over with him a Spani&s;h officer whom he had taken pri|&s;oner. His humanity made him de&s;irous of making the captivity of the Spaniard as ea&s;y as po&s;&s;ible; and in hopes of amu&s;ing him, he took him to view whatever was curious, in or near London, and among&s;t other places they vi&s;ited the Tower. Here the Earl was received by a roar of joy from his old companion, who immediately knew him, and &s;howed the great|e&s;t tran&s;ports at the return of his benefactor; nor did he &s;uffer him to depart, till, in the exce&s;s of his rapture, he had deprived his lord&s;hip of nearly the whole of his coat, though he very carefully avoided injuring his per&s;on.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE TWO-HORNED RHINOCEROS.</HEAD>
<P>THIS animal is &s;ound in Africa, chiefly a|bout the Cape of Good Hope, and is di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from the common or one-horned Rhinoceros, as well as from all other bea&s;ts, by having two horns upon its no&s;e, the larger of which &s;tands foremo&s;t towards the muzzle or &s;nout of the animal, the &s;horter behind it, and higher up towards the forehead. The fore|mo&s;t horn grows almo&s;t to the length of two feet, and &s;even or eight inches thick at the bottom; the hindmo&s;t &s;ometimes mea&s;ures &s;o long as &s;ixteen inches, and proportionably thick. They are of a conical &s;hape, with the tips inclined &s;omewhat backwards, but their &s;ize does not always appear to be in propor|tion to the body. This &s;pecies of Rhinoce|ros is endued with prodigious &s;trength, and, though little inferiour in &s;ize to the Elephant, and &s;omewhat re&s;embling it in its enormous unwieldy make, runs with a&s;toni&s;hing &s;wift|ne&s;s. It harbours among&s;t clo&s;e thickets and bu&s;hy cop&s;es, from whence it comes forth in the cool of the evening, to graze for the night. Its food con&s;i&s;ts of plants and roots, with the
<PB N="233" REF="030190_0238_0FE507E4EB7C6A70">
tops of &s;hrubs, and &s;mall branches of trees. The roots it is &s;uppo&s;ed to dig up with the &s;malle&s;t of its horns, as this, e&s;pecially in the older animals, is mo&s;t commonly ob&s;erved to be worn away in different parts, which is never the ca&s;e in the foremo&s;t and larger one. It is natural to &s;uppo&s;e that this latter is the offen|&s;ive weapon of the animal, and is therefore never u&s;ed in the &s;ervile employment of digging for its food, at which time it is turned on one &s;ide, out of the way; for the&s;e horns are &s;aid to be &s;o loo&s;e and moveable, that when the Rhinoceros walks carele&s;sly along, one may &s;ee its horns dangle about, and hear them cla&s;h and clatter again&s;t each other. The &s;hrubs and plants, which al&s;o compo&s;e part of its food, it clips off with its lips, not having any fore teeth for that purpo&s;e, Indeed it has little room for them, as the mouth goes off &s;o &s;harp at the fore part (&s;omething like that of a Tortoi&s;e) that it is only an inch and a half broad. Be|&s;ides, it has no occa&s;ion for any teeth there, the &s;kin which forms the lips being of the ex|treme hardne&s;s, that it can perform the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of teeth very well, and that with &s;o much the great|er ea&s;e, as the under jaw goes within the upper.</P>
<P>The tongue is perfectly &s;oft, which directly contradicts the common notion that the Rhi|noceros kills by licking with his tongue.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the formidable bulk and amazing &s;trength of this animal, which has been known to run up to a waggon and carry it to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance on its &s;nout and horns, the Hottentots and the Dutch farmers <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> live in the inland parts round the Cape of

Good Hope, frequently attack and overpower it. For the purpo&s;e of &s;hooting it they u&s;e balls made of lead and tin mixt, and having found out its retirement, they approach it on the &s;ide oppo&s;ite to that from which the wind blows. This precaution is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary on ac|count of the very acute &s;mell and hearing with which the animal is endued. At the lea&s;t noi&s;e more than u&s;ual, it takes the alarm, and erect|ing its ears, &s;tands clapping with them and li&s;t|ening; and if the hunter be &s;o imprudent as to get to the windward of it, even at a great di&s;|tance, it &s;eldom fails directly to follow him by the &s;cent and attack him with the greate&s;t fury. Being therefore pretty &s;ecure on the &s;ide of the wind, the Rhinoceros has the &s;agacity in gene|ral to choo&s;e, by way of entrenchment, a bu&s;h very thick, and high on that &s;ide from whence it has no &s;cent. If wounded it ru&s;hes out from the thickets into the plain, when the bolde&s;t &s;port&s;men prudently con&s;ult their &s;afety by flight. It &s;oon, however, turns a&s;ide, and if there be no cop&s;e convenient for its e&s;cape, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> off &s;traight forward over the plain; if they happen to have hounds out with them, the&s;e pur&s;ue it, and form a &s;trong contra&s;t to the colo&s;&s;al &s;ize of the animal, which, how|ever, &s;eems not to take the lea&s;t notice of them. With a gentle ri&s;e and fall of the neck it keeps on an even &s;teady cour&s;e, a kind of pacing, which neverthele&s;s gets over a great deal of ground: but this pace, on hearing a few &s;hots fired after it, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to a very fa&s;t gallop, &s;o as in an in&s;tant <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ave the hounds at a great di&s;tance behind; and, in all probability, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">

&s;port&s;man would inevitably be lo&s;t, who &s;hould happen to become the object of its pur&s;uit, if he had not art enough to get out of the &s;ight and &s;cent of it by &s;hifting and dodging occa|&s;ionally. In this particular the Rhinoceros is &s;aid to re&s;emble the Elephant, that without de|laying or &s;topping in the lea&s;t, it will run to the di&s;tance of many leagues from the place where it has been clo&s;ely hunted, or in any other way mole&s;ted.</P>
<P>The two-horned Rhinoceros &s;leeps in a different po&s;ture from the Elephant; it lies down on the ground on one &s;ide, and withal is &s;aid to &s;leep &s;o &s;ound, that the Hottentots and Dutch coloni&s;ts frequently &s;teal upon it while in that &s;ituation, and &s;hoot it; it differs very much in this re&s;pect from the common or one-horned Rhinoceros, which is de&s;cribed as by no means a &s;leepy animal. If it happens not to die immediately of its wounds, the Hottentot hunters will neverthele&s;s follow the traces of it for one or more days, till it drops down with weakne&s;s and fatigue. In general, however, they poi&s;on one or two of their darts <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> they attack it, in which ca&s;e they have no oc|ca&s;ion to wait &s;o many days as they otherwi&s;e would before their prey falls into their hands.</P>
<P>Fortunately for tho&s;e who attack the Rhi|noceros, with all its keenne&s;s of &s;mell and hearing, it labours under the di&s;advantage of being extremely near-&s;ighted. In effect, its eyes are very &s;mall and &s;unk into its head, which is perhaps the rea&s;on <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> it &s;ees but in|di&s;tinctly, and that only &s;traight forward, &s;o as <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to perceive a hor&s;eman at the di&s;tance

of fifty or &s;ixty yards upon the open plain, unle&s;s directed by its &s;cent or hearing to fix upon the object. Whenever therefore it hap|pens to receive a wound without being able to di&s;cover from what hand it proceeds, this cir|cum&s;tance &s;eems to provoke it to a greater de|gree of fury. Not knowing where to wreak its vengeance, it &s;wings the fore part of its body violently from one &s;ide to the other, and &s;nuffs up with its no&s;trils as if endeavouring to di&s;co|ver the enemy by its &s;mell. The noi&s;e which it makes with its no&s;e upon &s;uch occa&s;ions is particularly terrible to the hor&s;es of tho&s;e who are in chace of it: for when wounded, it will &s;nuff and blow &s;o hard and &s;o loud as to &s;tartle them, and make them unea&s;y, at the di&s;tance of &s;ome hundreds of yards. Indeed, in&s;tinct &s;ufficiently informs the hor&s;e of its danger, when the Rhinoceros is nigh, not only by the hear|ing but by the &s;mell al&s;o; for whenever the &s;port&s;men approach its retreat, which is always done again&s;t the wind, the hor&s;es having the advantage of the breeze, are enabled to di&s;co|ver their tremendous enemy &s;o far off as forty or fifty yards by the &s;mell: upon this they im|mediately &s;top, and give evident proofs of ter|ror by their unwilline&s;s to proceed any farther.</P>
<P>This animal is of a greyi&s;h or a&s;h colour, but, which is very remarkable, &s;eems to change its hue, and become almo&s;t black upon being hard hunted. This is owing probably to the du&s;t and dried mud that &s;ticks to its &s;kin (as it is very fond <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">rolling and wallowing in the mire), and when moi&s;tened by &s;weat, becomes much darker in colour.

however, where the &s;kin is not &s;o thick as on the re&s;t of the body, and almo&s;t quite &s;mooth, it is nearly the colour of a man's fle&s;h. On all other parts the &s;urface of the &s;kin is rough and knotty, and not much differing from that of an Elephant, but of a clo&s;er texture, and when it is dry, extremely hard. It has not, however, any of tho&s;e plaits and folds which are to be ob&s;erved in the common de&s;criptions and fi|gures publi&s;hed of it, and which give it the ap|pearance of being covered with a harne&s;s. The hide is an inch and a half thick on the back, and &s;omewhat thicker on the &s;ides, though le&s;s compact there. It is, however, by no means impenetrable, as has been commonly &s;uppo&s;ed. Leaden balls indeed will &s;ooner be flattened a|gain&s;t the &s;kin than pierce it; but when they are hardened by a proper mixture of tin, the Rhinoceros may be killed by a &s;ingle &s;hot. Nay, its hide, as well as that of the Elephant, is capable of being penetrated by javelins and darts. A Hottentot, at the di&s;tance of five or &s;ix paces, has been known to pierce through the hide of a Rhinoceros half a foot deep into its body. Some have al&s;o imagined it to po&s;|&s;e&s;s no feeling in its &s;kin; but, be&s;ides what is mentioned of the common Rhinoceros, that it is capable of being tickled under the belly with a whi&s;p of &s;traw, the Two-horned Rhinoceros is fond (as was mentioned before) of wallowing in the mire like a hog, which would hardly be the ca&s;e were its hide ab&s;olutely in&s;en&s;ible; and indeed, when the thick hide of an Elephant is affected by the &s;tinging of flies, we cannot &s;up|po&s;e that of the Rhinoceros to be totally de&s;|titute
<PB N="238" REF="030190_0243_0FE507F6C0133DC8">
of feeling. Its &s;kin, though tough and clo&s;e in its texture, has, particularly about the groin, ve&s;&s;els, blood, and juices, adapted for the nouri&s;hment of in&s;ects; and in effect this animal is found to be infe&s;ted in that part with a particular &s;pecies of in&s;ect; neither does the thickne&s;s of its hide hinder it from per&s;piring. La&s;tly, the Rhinoceros here de&s;cribed may be &s;aid to be totally de&s;titute of hair, though there are a few &s;cattered dark bri&s;tly hairs, about an inch long, on the edges of the ears, with a very few between and round about the horns, and at the tip of the tail. This part of the animal is about an inch thick, dimini&s;hing by degrees from the root to the tip, where it is flattened at the &s;ides; and on the edges, produced by this flatne&s;s, are to be &s;een &s;ome &s;trong &s;tiff hairs, an inch or an inch and a half in length. Such of them as &s;tand towards the creature's hard and rough body are vi&s;ibly worn down and &s;tunted.</P>
<P>Of the inward parts of this animal, it is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that its fle&s;h, when dre&s;t, ta&s;te a good deal like pork, but much coar&s;er. Its brain are le&s;s than tho&s;e of a middle-&s;ized man; like the hor&s;e, it has no gall; its en|trails al&s;o mo&s;t re&s;emble tho&s;e of a hor&s;e: &s;o that this bea&s;t, notwith&s;tanding its being fur|ni&s;hed with horns, does by no means belong to the cla&s;s of tho&s;e which chew the cud, but rather of tho&s;e who&s;e fat is of a &s;oft nature like lard, and not hard like tallow. The &s;tomach, however, does not bear the lea&s;t re&s;emblance to that of a hor&s;e, but rather to that of a man or hog; and the contents of it, when opened,

after the animal has been lately killed, are u&s;ually without &s;mell, and perfectly fre&s;h and &s;weet, con&s;i&s;ting of roots and &s;mall branches of trees chewed, &s;ome of them as big as the end of a man's finger; and of &s;ucculent plants, the whole diffu&s;ing around a very &s;trong and not di&s;agreeable aromatic odour.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE HUMMING-BIRD.</HEAD>
<P>OF this charming little animal, there are &s;ix or &s;even varieties, from the &s;ize of a &s;mall wren, down to that of an humble bee. An European could never have &s;uppo&s;ed a bird exi&s;ting &s;o very &s;mall, and yet completely furni&s;hed out with a bill, feathers, wings, and inte&s;tines, ex|actly re&s;embling tho&s;e of the large&s;t kind. A bird not &s;o big as the end of one's little finger, would probably be &s;uppo&s;ed but a creature of imagination, were it not &s;een in infinite num|bers, and as frequent as butterflies in a &s;um|mer's day, &s;porting in the fields of America, from flower to flower, and extracting their &s;weets with its little bill.</P>
<P>The &s;malle&s;t humming-bird is about the &s;ize of an hazel-nut. The feathers on its wings and tail are black; but tho&s;e on its body and under its wings, are of a greeni&s;h brown, with a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> red ca&s;t or glo&s;s, which no &s;ilk or velvet can imitate. It has a &s;mall cre&s;t on its head, green at the bottom, and as it were gilded at the top; and which &s;parkles in the &s;un like a little &s;tar in the middle of its forehead. The bill is
<PB N="240" REF="030190_0245_0FE5080793529C08">
black, &s;traight, &s;lender, and of the length of a &s;mall pin. The large&s;t humming-bird is near half as big as the common wren, and without a cre&s;t on its head; but to make amends, it is covered, from the throat half way down the belly, with changeable crim&s;on-coloured fea|thers, which, in different lights, change to a variety of beautiful colours, much like an opal. The heads of both are &s;mall, with very little round eyes as black as jet.</P>
<P>It is inconceivable how much the&s;e add to the high fini&s;hing and beauty of a rich luxuri|ous we&s;tern land&s;cape. As &s;oon as, the &s;un is ri&s;en, the humming-birds, of different kinds, are &s;een fluttering about the flowers, without ever lighting upon them Their wings are in &s;uch rapid motion, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;|cern their colours, except by their glittering. They are never &s;till, but continually in moti|on, vi&s;iting flower after flower, and extracting its honey. For this purpo&s;e they are furni&s;hed with a forked tongue, that enters the cup of the flower, and extracts its nectared tribute. Upon this alone they &s;ub&s;i&s;t. The rapid mo|tion of their wings brings out a humming &s;ound, whence they have their name.</P>
<P>The ne&s;ts of the&s;e birds are not le&s;s curious than the re&s;t: they are &s;u&s;pended in the air, at the point of the twigs of an orange, a pome|granate, or a citron tree; &s;ometimes even in hou&s;es, if they find a &s;mall and convenient twig for the purpo&s;e. The female is the architect, while the male goes in que&s;t of materials; &s;uch as cotton, file mo&s;s, and the fibres of vegeta|bles. The ne&s;t is about the &s;ize of an men's
<PB N="241" REF="030190_0246_0FE508091D38B298">
egg cut in two. They lay two eggs at a time, and never more, about the &s;ize of &s;mall peas, and as white as &s;now, with here and there a yel|low &s;peck. The time of incubation contin|ues twelves days; at the end of which the young ones appear, and are much about the &s;ize of a blue-bottle-fly.</P>
<P>It is a doubt whether or not the&s;e birds have a continued note in &s;inging. All travellers agree that, be&s;ide the humming noi&s;e produced by their wings they have a little interrupted chirrup; but Labat a&s;&s;erts, that they have a mo&s;t plea&s;ing melancholy melody in their voices, though &s;mall and proportioned to the organs which produce it. It is very probable that, in different places, their notes are al&s;o different; and as there are &s;ome that continue torpid all the winter, there may likewi&s;e be &s;ome with agreeable voices, though the re&s;t may in general be &s;ilent.</P>

<HEAD>THE NIGHTINGALE.</HEAD>
<P>THE NIGHTINGALE is the mo&s;t famous of the feathered tribe. It vi&s;its England in the be|ginning of April, and leaves it in Augu&s;t. It is found but in &s;ome of the &s;outhern parts of that country, being totally unknown in Scot|land, Ireland, or North Wales. They fre|quent
<PB N="242" REF="030190_0247_0FE5080AA8BB3F00">
thick hedges and low coppices, and ge|nerally keep in the middle of the bu&s;h, &s;o that they are rarely &s;een. They begin their &s;ong in the evening, and generally continue it for the whole night. For weeks together, if undi&s;|turbed, they &s;it upon the &s;ame tree; and Shake|&s;pear rightly de&s;cribes the nightingale &s;itting nightly in the &s;ame place.</P>
<P>In the begining of May, the nightingale prepares to make its ne&s;t, which is formed of the leaves of trees, &s;traw, and mo&s;s. The ne&s;t being very eagerly &s;ought after, is as cunning|ly &s;ecreted; &s;o that but very few of them are found by the boys when they go upon the&s;e pur&s;uits. It is built at the bottom of hedges, where the bu&s;hes are thicke&s;t and be&s;t covered. While the female continues &s;itting, the male at a good di&s;tance, but always within hearing, cheers the patient hen with his voice, and, by the &s;hort interruption of his &s;ong, often gives her warning of approaching danger. She lays four or five eggs; of which but a part, in that cold climate, come to maturity.</P>
<P>The delicacy, or rather the fame, of this bird's mu&s;ic, has induced many to abridge its liberty to &s;ecure its harmony. Its &s;ong, how|ever, in captivity is not &s;o very alluring; and the tyranny of taking it from tho&s;e hedges where only it is mo&s;t plea&s;ing, &s;till more depreciates its impri&s;oned efforts. Ge&s;ner a&s;&s;ures us, that it is not only the mo&s;t agreeable &s;ong&s;ter in a cage, but that it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a mo&s;t admira|ble faculty of talking. He tells the following &s;tory in proof of his a&s;&s;ertion, which he &s;ays was communicated to him by a friend. <Q>Whil&s;t

I was at Rati&s;bone, &s;ays his corre&s;pondent, I put up at an inn, the &s;ign of the Golden Crown, where my ho&s;t had three nightin|gales. It happened at that time, being the &s;pring of the year, when tho&s;e birds are ac|cu&s;tomed to &s;ing, that I was &s;o afflicted with the &s;tone, that I could &s;leep but very little all night. It was u&s;ual then about mid|night to hear the two nightingales jangling. and talking with each other, and plainly im|itating men's di&s;cour&s;es. Be&s;ides repeating the daily di&s;cour&s;e of the gue&s;ts, they chant|ed out two &s;tories. One of their &s;tories was concerning the tap&s;ter and his wi&s;e, who re|fu&s;ed to follow him to the wars as he de&s;ired her; for the hu&s;band endeavoured to per|&s;uade his wife, as far as I under&s;tood by the buds, that he would leave his &s;ervice in that inn, and go to the wars in hopes of plunder. But &s;he refu&s;ed to follow him, re&s;olving to &s;tay either at Rati&s;bone, or go to Nuremberg. There was a long and earne&s;t contention be|tween them; and all this dialogue the birds repeated. The other &s;tory was concerning the war which the emperor was then threatening again&s;t the prote&s;tants; which the birds pro|bably heard from &s;ome of the generals that had conferences in the hou&s;e. The&s;e things did they repeat in the night after twelve o'clock, when there was a deep &s;ilence. But in the day time, for the mo&s;t part, they were &s;ilent, and &s;eemed to do nothing but meditate and revolve with them&s;elves upon what the gue&s;ts conferred together as they &s;at at table, or in their walks.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="030190_0249_0FE4FE8AC523DF48">
Such is the &s;agacity a&s;cribed to the nightin|gale. But there is a little bird, rather celebrat|ed for its affection to mankind than its &s;inging, which however, in a Briti&s;h climate, has the &s;weete&s;t note of all others. The reader already perceives that I mean the RED-BREAST, the well|known friend of man, that is found in every hedge, and makes it vocal. The note of other birds is louder, and their inflections more ca|pricious; but this bird's voice is &s;oft, tender, and well &s;upported; and the more to be valued as it is enjoyed the greate&s;t part of the winter. If the nightingale's &s;ong has been compared to the fiddle, the red-brea&s;t's voice has all the delicacy of the flute.</P>

<HEAD>THE THREE BROTHERS.</HEAD>
<P>EUGENE, RICHARD, and CASSANDER, were the &s;ons of Mr. Smith&s;on, a reputable mer|chant in the North of Old England, who hav|ing no other children be&s;ides them, and being in pretty affluent circum&s;tances, re&s;olved to have them educated immediately under his own eye. For this purpo&s;e he invited into his hou&s;e a Mr. Markham, a gentleman of learning and approved morals, to be their tutor, who&s;e care and attention to their improvement afterwards fully an&s;wered all his expectations.</P>
<P>The&s;e Three Brothers, from their earlie&s;t in|fancy, were play-mates and companions. They had never been &s;ent out of their father's hou&s;e, either to nur&s;e or even to a &s;chool: as Mrs. Smith&s;on, their mother, who&s;e education ren|dered her perfectly equal to the ta&s;k, under|took to put them through the fir&s;t rudiments of learning, and to prepare them for whatever &s;tudies a tutor might afterwards direct them to. Whether it was their con&s;tant &s;ociety from their earlie&s;t childhood; in the cour&s;e of which, notwith&s;tanding the difference of two years, be|tween
<PB N="246" REF="030190_0251_0FE4FE970A09B7A8">
the age of Ca&s;&s;ander and that of Eugene, each &s;hared invariably in the &s;tudies as well as the amu&s;ements of the other two; or whether it was the natural bent of their di&s;po&s;itions, I know not, but they were remarkable for bear|ing towards each other a degree of affection that is rarely to be found among&s;t brothers in general. In their &s;ports they were in&s;eparable; the inequality of their number was never an ob|&s;tacle to their all partaking of the &s;ame pa&s;time, though it might originally have been intended but for two; and notwith&s;tanding there would now and then ari&s;e a trifling di&s;pute among&s;t them concerning their play, all differences were u&s;ually &s;ettled and reconciled before the con|clu&s;ion of the game, &s;o that they never parted from each other in a pet; but, on the contrary, after they were tired of play, it was no un|common thing to &s;ee them linked all three arm in arm, &s;auntering up and down the gar|den walks, which were commonly the &s;cene of their amu&s;ements; and in that friendly at|titude communicating to each other their little fancies, di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the remarkale &s;tories that occurred in the cour&s;e of their le&s;&s;ons, or el&s;e laying their heads together to plan and &s;trike out &s;ome new mode of diver&s;ion.</P>
<P>Thus agreeing, and unanimous in all things, they entered with plea&s;ure upon the cour&s;e of &s;tudy laid down to them by Mr. Markham, their tutor. Mrs. Smith&s;on had never, while her &s;ons were under her care, made their le&s;|&s;ons a painful or di&s;agreeable ta&s;k; the novelty therefore of Mr. Markham's fir&s;t examination, under whom they found that they were to learn

both Latin and Greek, &s;o charmed and de|lighted them, that they all three jumped for joy when their Papa &s;howed them three Latin Grammars, which they were to begin the next day.</P>
<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>Be&s;ides, their &s;atisfaction at not being o|bliged to leave their dear parents, nor to be &s;e|parated from each other, might not a little con|tribute to the alacrity they &s;howed on this oc|ca&s;ion. In effect the quickne&s;s of their pro|gre&s;s &s;urprized and delighted Mr. Markham,
<PB N="248" REF="030190_0253_0FE4FEA2A7825970">
their pre&s;ent tutor, as well as their former one, that is their Mama, to whom they would run every day in raptures of joy to communicate the contents of their &s;everal le&s;&s;ons.</P>
<P>Hitherto we have &s;een Eugene, Richard and Ca&s;&s;ander, perfectly alike and equal in all things; it is nece&s;&s;ary now to &s;how in what re&s;|pects they were unlike, and how the particular character and di&s;po&s;ition of each, though lead|ing to actions extremely different from what the others would pur&s;ue, yet always uniformly concurred in the exertion of that amiable prin|ciple, brotherly love.</P>
<P>Eugene, therefore, with much genero&s;ity and &s;omething of fire in his compo&s;ition, was at the &s;ame time a little arch, or what is called waggi&s;h. His pranks in general were the mo&s;t innocent in the world, it is true, and he could &s;ay at lea&s;t, that he never meant to hurt: if, however, it would &s;ometimes happen, which after all was &s;eldom the ca&s;e, that any of his little jokes co&s;t either of his brothers a tear; that tear, it was ea&s;y to be &s;een, gave Eugene infinitely more pain than any he him&s;elf &s;hed: but the open frankne&s;s and ardent good-nature, with which he would con&s;ole his weeping bro|ther, &s;eldom failed to dry it up in a moment. He would never ju&s;tify his own mi&s;takes or his awkwardne&s;s; and thus he &s;eldom felt the re|proaches of his companions, becau&s;e they al|ways found him ready to &s;ubmit to them can|didly, and, whenever it &s;o happened, to own him&s;elf in the fault.</P>
<P>Richard, on the other hand, was all &s;impli|city: he had not the lea&s;t &s;hadow of de&s;ign in
<PB N="249" REF="030190_0254_0FE4FEA4A36FC700">
him; and were it not for the extraordinary ap|prehen&s;ion that he &s;howed in his learning, in which he out&s;tripped both his brothers, he might be &s;aid not to have a thought of his own. Thus Richard, though as cheerful as the day, &s;eldom laughed unle&s;s Eugene or Ca&s;&s;ander led the joke. He never propo&s;ed a new &s;ort of play, or invented a fre&s;h plaything, but always was ready, with the greate&s;t good humour, to join in the one and admire the other, if offered to his attention by either of his brothers. He might even be &s;aid to have no wants or likings of his own, but as they put him in mind of them. If Eugene &s;aid to the maid, "Molly, I want to go to bed;" Richard would add, "&s;o do I too." If Ca&s;&s;ander &s;aid, "Mama, pray give me a piece of bread and butter," Richard, it pre&s;ent, would commonly join, "Aye, and me too." And this di&s;po&s;ition of Richard was the happie&s;t in the world; for pre&s;erving the friend|&s;hip of the Three Brothers; &s;ince, whatever advantage or &s;uperiority he might have in his learning, all his amu&s;ements, all the plea&s;ure that he enjoyed from &s;ociety, depended wholly on Eugene and Ca&s;&s;ander.</P>
<P>This la&s;t was neither &s;o volatile as his elder brother, nor &s;o &s;imple as Richard: he had &s;omething grave even in his countenance, and though younge&s;t of the three, was allowed to be much the mo&s;t prudent; by which means he balanced, as it were, the oppo&s;ite defects of his brothers, and frequently would act as their advi&s;er and cen&s;or, by reproving Eugene for his too great vivacity, which led him &s;o often into &s;crapes, and Richard for his thoughtle&s;s ab&s;ence and extreme credulity. But though
<PB N="250" REF="030190_0255_0FE4FDBB8579E6B8">
he &s;ometimes took this freedom, it was always with the greate&s;t tenderne&s;s, being accu&s;tomed from his infancy to treat his elders with re&s;pect, particularly his brothers. Indeed a re&s;pect for their elders and &s;uperiors Mrs. Smith&s;on took early care to inculcate on the minds of all her children. Richard was commanded, to yield in every thing to Eugene, and Ca&s;&s;ander to Richard; and all three to behave with proper deference to tho&s;e who were more advanced in life than them&s;elves. This injunction had a good effect more ways than one: it prevented any childi&s;h conte&s;ts for the preference, as each knew and was contented with his own rank, and always waited his proper turn. Be&s;ides, it made them behave with good manners to &s;trangers, let their condition in life be what it will; nor was any one of them ever known to &s;peak or act with petulance even to a beggar.</P>
<P>After remaining a competent time under the in&s;truction of Mr. Markham, it was their fa|ther's plea&s;ure that they &s;hould all three enter the Univer&s;ity together, and pur&s;ue their &s;tudies there, in order to qualify them&s;elves for what|ever of the learned profe&s;&s;ions they might af|terwards choo&s;e. This circum&s;tance gave them infinite plea&s;ure. The love that they bore to each other while children, was now ripening into a &s;teady, ardent friend&s;hip, which no time could alter or dimini&s;h; and they &s;aw before them a pro&s;pect of being happy in each other's &s;ociety during the whole cour&s;e of their lives. But human events are uncertain, and the &s;hades of misfortune often intervene unexpectedly to chequer the mo&s;t equal and placid &s;un&s;hine of
<PB N="251" REF="030190_0256_0FE4FEA94EB7D668">
pro&s;perity. Mr. Smith&s;on was &s;till in trade, and therefore liable to accidents and cro&s;&s;es which merchants frequently experience. It hap|pened, in the beginning of the war, that two &s;hips, containing property of his to a very con|&s;iderable amount, unin&s;ured, were taken by the enemy. The deficiency produced in his capital by this misfortune, joined to &s;everal other &s;maller lo&s;&s;es, obliged Mr. Smith&s;on to become a bankrupt; after which, conceiving a di&s;ta&s;te to his native place, he determined to take a voyage to the We&s;t Indies, in order to look after an e&s;tate in land which had been be|queathed him as a legacy by &s;ome di&s;tant rela|tion &s;ince the time of his failure. At his de|parture, not judging it expedient to take his wife along with him, he left her a &s;mall &s;um of ready money, but promi&s;ed to &s;end over remit|tances whenever the property, of which he went to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, could be turned to any account.</P>
<P>Our Three Brothers were incon&s;olable at parting with their father: this was the fir&s;t time in their lives that they might be &s;aid to feel the grief of ab&s;ence from their beloved parents; for while at College they could hardly be called ab&s;ent from home, as they conver&s;ed weekly, nay almo&s;t daily, by letters, either with Mr. or Mrs. Smith&s;on. But their &s;orrow was con|&s;iderably increa&s;ed, when, after two years had elap&s;ed without any tidings from their father, they received a melancholy epi&s;tle from Mrs. Smith&s;on, informing them of her utter inability to maintain them any longer at College, and reque&s;ting their immediate return, in order to

<P>During the la&s;t two years that they had &s;pent at the Univer&s;ity, nothing but the &s;trict|e&s;t economy, on the part of the Brothers, as well as that of their indulgent parent, could have enabled them to &s;ub&s;i&s;t; yet notwith&s;tand|ing the general di&s;&s;ipation of the place, their temperance and frugality did not hinder them from &s;upporting an amiable character, and be|ing highly e&s;teemed by all who knew them. They were remarked for an obliging, affable demeanour, an unexceptionable attention to their College duties, but particularly for the &s;trict intimacy and happy degree of unanimity which they always appeared to maintain. They were indeed di&s;tingui&s;hed by the title of the <HI>Three Brothers;</HI> and the wits of the place &s;poke of them as an exception to that remark of the poet
<Q><L>Friend&s;hip, like love, is but a name,</L>
<L>Unle&s;s to one you &s;tint the flame,</L></Q>
<PB N="253" REF="030190_0258_0FE4FDB39FB0B390">
However, there was a con&s;iderable difference in their di&s;po&s;itions, which, without the lea&s;t impairing their affection, grew every day more and more con&s;picuous. Eugene was now am|bitious, enterpri&s;ing, and changeable: his parts were rather brilliant than &s;olid. Ca&s;&s;ander, on the contrary, was &s;teady in his opinions and re|&s;olutions, which he built on the &s;ounde&s;t and mo&s;t mature reflexion: he appeared more &s;low in apprehending the difficulties of &s;cience than his elder brother; but, in return, his memory was more faithful and retentive, and whatever knowledge he once made his own was ever af|ter at his command; for, as Mr. Pope elegant|ly ob&s;erves,
<Q><L>Where beams of warm imagination play,</L>
<L>The memory's &s;oft figures melt away</L></Q>
Richard was a &s;ort of <HI>medium</HI> between the&s;e oppo&s;ites: with &s;omething of Fugene's viva|city and the &s;teadine&s;s of Ca&s;&s;ander, he had an ardent and in&s;atiable thir&s;t of knowledge; in effect, he had recommended him&s;elf &s;o power|fully to his &s;uperiors, by the extent and &s;plen|dour of his attainments, that he was at this very time of Mrs. Smith&s;on's writing for him and his brothers, pointed out to a nobleman, equally re&s;pectable for his rank and principles, as a proper per&s;on to be private tutor to his Lord&s;hip's two &s;ons, who were lately entered at the Univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>At their return, therefore, upon the &s;um|mons of their mother, when &s;he laid before them the melancholy &s;tate of their affairs, the di&s;appointment of their expectations, and, to
<PB N="254" REF="030190_0259_0FE4FEB2CABDF060">
crown all, the dreadful apprehen&s;ions that &s;he entertained of the lo&s;s of her hu&s;band, either at &s;ea or by the ca&s;ualties of war; concluding with the tendere&s;t advice to them, to unite their efforts towards the re-e&s;tabli&s;hing of their circum&s;tances by a &s;teady cour&s;e of indu&s;try in whatever profe&s;&s;ions they might adopt: upon this occa&s;ion it was that the advantages of &s;u|perior application and a more rapid progre&s;s in learning appeared con&s;picuous. While Eugene and Ca&s;&s;ander endeavour to comfort Mrs. Smith&s;on by the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urances of their future diligence and the exertion of their in|du&s;try in &s;ome line or other that might afford them&s;elves and her a decent maintenance, Richard had the happine&s;s of being able to make his mother and brothers the immediate tender of a &s;mall competency from the &s;alary which his noble patron was to allow him, who only waited for his an&s;wer to inve&s;t him with the care of his children's education. This pro&s;pect was a &s;ea&s;onable relief to Mrs. Smith|&s;on from the de&s;pondency into which the pre|&s;ent gloom of her affairs had thrown her. It is true, the iron hand of want had not as yet be|gun to pinch her and her children, but the near approach of that unwelcome vi&s;itor (with|out &s;uch a re&s;ource as Richard now &s;ugge&s;ted), was &s;ufficient to fill her mind with the mo&s;t melancholy ideas and di&s;mal pre&s;ages of adver|&s;ity and di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Now therefore at length, by the irre&s;i&s;tible decree of nece&s;&s;ity, were our Three Brothers obliged to part, and take different walks on the va&s;t theatre of life. Richard, returning to the
<PB N="255" REF="030190_0260_0FE4FEB45F82C5C0">
Univer&s;ity, attached him&s;elf with &s;o much &s;uc|ce&s;s to the education of his noble pupils, and to his own improvement, that, be&s;ides being able for the pre&s;ent to contribute to the com|forts of his mother, and tho&s;e whom he held mo&s;t dear next to her, he had the pro&s;pect be|fore him of obtaining an ample &s;ettlement in the church, through the intere&s;t of his munifi|cent patron, who&s;e favour he enjoyed in as full a mea&s;ure as his numerous good qualities enti|tled him to it. Eugene, having procured re|commendations to a merchant in London, re|paired thither, and, applying him&s;elf &s;teadily to bu&s;ine&s;s, in the cour&s;e of four years gave &s;uch proofs of his integrity and other good qualifica|tions, that he was taken by the merchant into partner&s;hip. Ca&s;&s;ander, in the mean time, fearing to become a burthen on the moderate pen&s;ion that Richard allowed his mother, em|braced the offer of a Newca&s;tle trader, who, hav|ing formerly been an intimate friend of Mr. Smith&s;on's agreed to take Ca&s;&s;ander a voyage to the Ea&s;t country upon trial. Ca&s;&s;ander was &s;till but young, being no more than &s;ixteen at the time of his entering upon a &s;ea life, and af|ter his voyage of trial he prudently made it his choice, in preference to waiting for the un|certain chance of &s;ome more brilliant e&s;tabli&s;h|ment. In effect, what with the advantage of an excellent education, a patient and humane di&s;po&s;ition, and the uncommon character (for a &s;eaman) of being remarkably &s;ober and fru|gal, he in a very few years &s;o improved him&s;elf in the knowledge of trade and navigation, that he was appointed mate of a ve&s;&s;el trading to
<PB N="256" REF="030190_0261_0FE4FEB5EC193328">
Ru&s;&s;ia, the owners of which were &s;o well plea&s;|ed with his activity and good conduct, that they were determined, notwith&s;tanding his youth, to &s;end him out ma&s;ter of one of their &s;hips, the fir&s;t opportunity that offered.</P>
<P>Thus, for &s;ome years after the &s;eparation of the Three Brothers, fortune &s;eemed to recom|pen&s;e the &s;evere lo&s;s that they had felt in the per&s;on of their father, concerning whom, all this time, notwith&s;tanding every po&s;&s;ible in|quiry, not the &s;malle&s;t intelligence had been received. But now, alas! once more, &s;orrow and adver&s;ity came hand in hand to di&s;quiet the feeling hearts of our three youths, by an hour of trial &s;uch as they had never yet experienced. The news of their mother's death was the &s;e|vere prelude to their misfortunes. Richard had &s;carcely recovered the &s;hock of this, when the death of his patron totally di&s;&s;ipated all the flattering hopes that he had formed of fortune and preferment in the church, in which he had already taken orders. Eugene, and his partner had for &s;ome time felt their affairs in a critical condition; but this did not hinder him from exerting his native genero&s;ity in the &s;ervice of an ancient friend. Indeed, the voice of friend|&s;hip and gratitude always met with a favoura|ble hearing from Eugene, let their &s;ummons be ever &s;o pre&s;&s;ing and importunate. His old tutor, Mr. Markham, under whom he and his brothers had &s;pent &s;ome of the happie&s;t years of their life, was at this time in London. Di&s;|abled by &s;ickne&s;s and infirmity, advancing fa&s;t towards helple&s;s old age, and &s;orely galled by poverty and the neglect of the world, he was

almo&s;t without a friend. In this cri&s;is, chance threw his generous pupil in his way, who am|ply &s;upplied the place of one to him. Be&s;ides
<FIGURE>

furni&s;hing him with the means of &s;upplying his pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ities; Eugene, and by his per|&s;ua&s;ion his partner, became &s;ecurity for the payment of a very con&s;iderable debt, which was on the point of con&s;igning Mr. Markham to a gaol, where he might probably have pa&s;&s;ed the remainder of his life. But how ill did for|tune requite Eugene for this friendly action! Mr. Markham died in le&s;s than three months after, when of cour&s;e the debt devolved upon tho&s;e who had given &s;ecurity for him. Imme|diately upon the heels of this misfortune follow|ed another. The affairs of Eugene's partner&s;hip growing de&s;perate, they were obliged to declare them&s;elves bankrupt, and this very kindne&s;s which he &s;howed Mr. Markham, was reckoned
<PB N="258" REF="030190_0263_0FE5071DF6F1E718">
among the misfortunes that contributed to his ruin. The &s;hock that Eugene's &s;pirits &s;uffered upon this occa&s;ion, as he found him&s;elf now un|able to fulfil engagements which he looked up|on as &s;acred, drove him from one act of ra&s;h|ne&s;s and de&s;pair to another; till in the end, re|duced to extremity of want, in an ob&s;cure coun|try place, he madly and precipitately threw him&s;elf among a company of travelling players, and, to crown all, in this unpromi&s;ing &s;tate of life, being barely able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t him&s;elf, he had the de&s;perate imprudence to marry. It &s;eems he had formed a &s;light acquaintance with a young lady (the daughter of a clergyman), who was &s;o &s;truck with his figure and accompli&s;hments, that &s;he yielded to his &s;olicitations to be united with him in the ties of clande&s;tine wedlock; thereby utterly forfeiting all her expectations of fortune, together with the friend&s;hip of eve|ry one of her relations. The con&s;equence of this unadvi&s;ed &s;tep, which brought poverty and her train into Eugene's habitation in &s;hapes unknown before, he bore with as much forti|tude and philo&s;ophy as u&s;ually falls to the &s;hare of five and twenty, that is, with very little if any at all. Some time before this, Ca&s;&s;ander who had made two or three voyages for his north-country owners, was invited to London by his brother and his partner, to take the command of one of the large &s;hips in which they were principal proprietors. Overjoyed at this invitation, which would give him an op|portunity, or rather indeed lay him under the nece&s;&s;ity, of being frequently with his brother while on &s;hore, he came to town with all &s;peed,
<PB N="259" REF="030190_0264_0FE5072073094EC0">
and was ju&s;t time enough to be witne&s;s to the unfortunate failure of Eugene and his a&s;&s;ociate in trade.</P>
<P>Thus were the Three Brothers plunged into circum&s;tances of the mo&s;t helple&s;s di&s;tre&s;s, ju&s;t at a time when they entertained hopes (appa|rently well founded) of fixing them&s;elves to their &s;atisfaction for life in their re&s;pective pro|fe&s;&s;ions. Had any one of them been exempt from the pre&s;&s;ure of misfortune, the other two would have been &s;ure of partaking with him in the comforts that depend on a competency of wealth. But all three were equally reduced; and the only remnant of happine&s;s, that they could call their own, was the &s;en&s;e of their mu|tual affection, which &s;till continued unalter|able, amid&s;t the mo&s;t pinching trials of di&s;ap|pointment and calamity. In this &s;ituation were the Smith&s;ons, when an incident happened which put that affection to the proof, and brought forth in&s;tances of &s;elf-denial and gene|ro&s;ity that well de&s;erve to be recorded. In the cour&s;e of Eugene's wanderings as a country player, fortune conducted him to Grave&s;end where, as he was exhibiting before an audience, chiefly compo&s;ed of &s;eafaring people, the &s;ame fortune unaccountably led his father to become a &s;pectator of his performance. In order to ex|plain the &s;udden appearance of Mr. Smith&s;on, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to relate what befel him af|ter his departure from England. The reader will remember that this gentleman had &s;et &s;ail for the We&s;t-Indies, in order to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an e&s;tate in one of the i&s;lands there; but, having pretty early intelligence that the enemy
<PB N="260" REF="030190_0265_0FE5072201315410">
were ma&s;ters of the i&s;land, and therefore ap|prehending numberle&s;s ob&s;tacles to his obtain|ing clear and quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the e&s;tate; he formed the immediate re&s;olution of getting out, if po&s;&s;ible, to the Ea&s;t Indies, where he tru&s;ted that, by his general knowledge of trade, he &s;hould in a &s;hort time be able to retrieve his &s;hattered circum&s;tances, and to return to his native country with a fortune &s;ufficient to ren|der the remaining years of his life ea&s;y and com|fortable. At the &s;ame time he took another re|&s;olution (the &s;ource of infinite grief and di&s;|quiet to his family), which was, never to in|form them of the place of his retirement until he had gained wealth &s;ufficient to relea&s;e them from the &s;tate of indigence and ob&s;curity into which, he was pur&s;uaded, his ab&s;ence mu&s;t have plunged them. This object he amply accom|pli&s;hed in ten years, during all which time his family con&s;idered him as dead; and at the end of that period he was now returning to &s;hare his riches with tho&s;e whom he held mo&s;t dear; when the fir&s;t &s;ight that &s;aluted his eyes after he went on &s;hore was his unfortunate &s;on figuring in the humble profe&s;&s;ion of a &s;troller. It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the rage, &s;orrow, and di&s;appoint|ment, which at once took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mr. Smith&s;on's brea&s;t, when he was at length con|vinced that his eyes and ears did not deceive him. He &s;uddenly left the theatre, or rather barn, before the play was half over, and tak|ing no farther notice of his &s;on than to leave a note directed for him, and filled with the bit|tere&s;t reproaches, he hurried on board the &s;hip. Upon his arrival in London, finding his anxi|ous
<PB N="261" REF="030190_0266_0FE507309629A908">
wi&s;hes and all the projects of his affection di&s;concerted by his elde&s;t &s;on's imprudence; his next care was to make inquiry about Richard and Ca&s;&s;ander; for his wife's death he had been informed of by mere accident a &s;hort time be|fore he left India. Richard he &s;oon found out, who, upon the fir&s;t &s;ummons, flew to embrace his long lo&s;t parent. Mr. Smith&s;on, after brief|ly relating to him the circum&s;tances of his voy|age to and &s;ucce&s;s in the Ea&s;t Indies, began, bitterly to lament his misfortune in having a &s;on &s;o abandoned to mode&s;ty and di&s;cretion, as he &s;tyled the unfortunate Eugene. He added, that the bulk of the fortune which he had realized abroad, he intended now to divide between his two younger &s;ons, the elder having proved him|&s;elf &s;o unworthy of his favour: that he did not mean to keep them in expectation until his death, but would put each of them in imme|diate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an ample fortune; re&s;erving for him&s;elf what he was determined &s;hould be &s;ufficient for his nece&s;&s;ities during the remain|der of his life. He concluded with in&s;i&s;ting, that whatever he meant thus to di&s;po&s;e in favour of his younger &s;ons, he would take care to &s;ee &s;ettled in &s;uch a manner, that neither Eugene nor his po&s;terity &s;hould ever inherit a penny of it.</P>
<P>Richard mode&s;tly thanked his father for the affectionate care that he te&s;tified for his intere&s;t, but tenderly intreated him not to form too pre|cipitate a re&s;olution to the prejudice of his elde&s;t born. He u&s;ed many arguments to excu&s;e, or at lea&s;t to palliate Eugene's indi&s;cretion; repre|&s;ented the &s;orrowful effects that a continuance
<PB N="262" REF="030190_0267_0FE5073221AB6280">
of his father's re&s;entment might have upon a mind &s;o exqui&s;itely feeling as his; and ended with the&s;e words: "As to what regards my own per&s;onal advantage, I a&s;&s;ure you Sir, I feel my&s;elf naturally very indifferent; and were I not &s;o by nature, the profe&s;&s;ion that I have em|braced, the precepts of which I have with my whole heart con&s;ented to obey, that profe&s;&s;ion commands me to fix my thoughts and expect|ations upon matters of a far different nature. Be&s;ides, had I the mo&s;t worldly regard for my own intere&s;t, the affection that I have ever borne, and &s;till bear to my brother Eugene, would &s;tand as a bar to my accepting any fortune to which he had the mo&s;t di&s;tant claim. I am not with|out hopes, my dear father, that when your pre|&s;ent anger &s;ub&s;ides, you will once more look upon him with the tenderne&s;s of a parent, in which ca&s;e you will, I tru&s;t, applaud the prin|ciple that induces me to decline your liberal offer." Mr. Smith&s;on, with a&s;toni&s;hment in his countenance, a&s;ked his &s;on if he was &s;erious in refu&s;ing &s;o hand&s;ome a fortune; and finding him fixed in the determination that he had be|fore expre&s;&s;ed, he ro&s;e up with evident marks of vexation and di&s;appointment; and ca&s;ting &s;ome uncharitable reflexions on the de&s;tiny which, he &s;aid, pur&s;ued him through life, baffling and fru&s;trating the mo&s;t favourite and even lauda|ble wi&s;hes of his heart, he added in a tone of voice, &s;omewhat &s;oftened, "Little did I expect, when I &s;ent for you, to find you an abettor of that profligacy which has alienated my heart from your elder brother. I fondly thought that my children would pay &s;uch deference to my
<PB N="263" REF="030190_0268_0FE50733ABC01A90">
authority as even to adopt my prejudices; but &s;ince you have determined to think for your|&s;elf, be your own ma&s;ter. Thank Heaven, I have yet one &s;on left." Richard endeavoured in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful manner, to repre&s;ent the motives of his conduct, but perceiving that whatever he &s;aid only tended to irritate his fa|ther, and that it was impo&s;&s;ible, for the pre|&s;ent, to obtain a calm hearing, he reluctantly withdrew, leaving his father in a &s;ituation not to be envied by a parent.</P>
<P>Nothing could arrive more opportunely to relieve the depre&s;&s;ion of Mr. Smith&s;on's &s;pirits, than the news that he heard next morning; which was, that a &s;hip, in which Ca&s;&s;ander had gone out in the capacity of a mate, after the failure of Eugene, was returned from her voy|age in the river. His re&s;entment was now not only pointed at Eugene for his indi&s;cretion, but at Richard for his too &s;crupulous, uncomply|ing principles. He was therefore determined to be&s;tow his whole fortune upon Ca&s;&s;ander. But what language can expre&s;s the amazement of Mr. Smith&s;on, when, upon his propo&s;ing to do &s;o, the generous &s;eaman, without the lea&s;t he|&s;itation or preamble, flatly refu&s;ed to accept a penny of it! He thought, however, that re|&s;pect to his father required him to give the rea&s;ons on which he grounded his refu&s;al. He did &s;o, and with arguments nearly the &s;ame as tho&s;e u&s;ed by his brother Richard, he endea|voured to convince his father that pa&s;&s;ion had a much greater &s;hare than mature deliberation in the &s;entence which he was going to pa&s;s upon his elde&s;t &s;on: "We are all liable to go a|&s;tray,"
<PB N="264" REF="030190_0269_0FE5073534B0A5C0">
&s;aid Ca&s;&s;ander: "happy is he who has the fewe&s;t faults. If we do not forgive tho&s;e of a &s;on, or a brother, Heaven help us when our own come to be judged! As for me, I have lived contented with a little, and am not un|acquainted with hard&s;hip and di&s;tre&s;s. God for|bid, therefore, that I &s;hould gra&s;p at my bro|ther's birth-right.&mdash;But I declare, were Eugene no brother of mine, knowing as I do his gene|rons nature and the warmth of his hone&s;t heart, I would go before the ma&s;t all my life long, &s;ooner than accept, to his prejudice, a property which nature and rea&s;on &s;o clearly adjudge to him."</P>
<P>There was &s;omething &s;o ingenuous in this addre&s;s of Ca&s;&s;ander's, &s;omething that &s;poke &s;o feelingly to his father's brea&s;t, that, in &s;pite of a &s;hort conflict which re&s;entment endeavoured to excite there, he found him&s;elf con&s;trained to yield the point, and while he wiped away a tear, the offspring of returning tenderne&s;s and affection, he took his &s;on by the hand: "Ca&s;|&s;ander," &s;aid he, &s;miling, "thou ha&s;t con|quered. Surely there mu&s;t be &s;omething of extraordinary merit in Eugene, &s;ince he has found two &s;o re&s;olute advocates in his favour as you and your brother Richard.&mdash;Well, I for|give all the pa&s;t&mdash;it &s;hall be buried in oblivi|on.&mdash;Convince me, as I doubt not you will, that my elde&s;t &s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es qualities worthy to excite &s;uch &s;entimnets as you have both expre&s;&s;|ed in his favour, and I &s;hall be happy indeed."</P>
<P>It is needle&s;s to add, that the joy produced by this favourable change in Mr. Smith&s;on's feelings was &s;oon diffu&s;ed in the brea&s;ts of his
<PB N="265" REF="030190_0270_0FE5074552B00EC0">
two di&s;con&s;olate &s;ons. Eugene, upon the re|ceipt of his father's note, had hurried up to town from Grave&s;end, like one di&s;tracted, and was now at Richard's lodgings, indulging the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate effu&s;ions of grief and de&s;pair, while Richard, depre&s;&s;ed with a load of &s;orrows, &s;at moping in &s;ilence, without a word of comfort to offer to his brother. They hardly perceived Ca&s;&s;ander enter the room; but when he met their eyes, they &s;tarted as at the &s;ight of an an|gel. Something prophetic whi&s;pered comfort to their minds even before he &s;poke. But how

full was the mea&s;ure of their joy when he an|nounced to them his father's invitation to repair immediately to his pre&s;ence! The &s;equel is ea|&s;y to be imagined: all was reconciled: the pa&s;t was forgotten, and the future opened a pro&s;pect of happine&s;s before them more &s;miling than they had ever enjoyed before.</P>

Thus the Brothers, by the efforts of their mutual affection, increa&s;ed the happine&s;s that pro&s;perity afforded them, &s;u&s;tained each other under the pre&s;&s;ure of misfortune, and, by per|&s;evering in unalterable friend&s;hip to each other, at length en&s;ured both their own happine&s;s and that of their deare&s;t and fir&s;t friend on earth&mdash;their Father.</P>

<HEAD>THE THREE SISTERS.</HEAD>
<P>NOT many years ago there returned from Bengal a man whom we will call John Sterling: he had been well educated, was &s;prung from a decent family, and brought home the &s;ame good heart which he carried out with him from Britain. As his fortune was now very large, and he had formed no matrimonial connexions, his fir&s;t care, on his arriving in his native land, was to di&s;cover what relations he had &s;till re|maining, and to inquire into their circum|&s;tances, in order to be&s;tow on the mo&s;t de&s;erv|ing of them, part of his great acqui&s;itions. It chanced that the per&s;on to whom he applied, was able to a&s;&s;i&s;t in his &s;earch. "Some at lea&s;t," &s;aid he, "of your family, I can give you a pretty good account of: you have two cou|&s;ins

&s;ettled in London; they are &s;i&s;ters, and are by no means in di&s;tre&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances, but are perfect contra&s;ts to each other in their man|ner of living. The elde&s;t of them is avarici|ous to an extreme, lives in a paltry lodging, keeps but one maid &s;ervant, and in &s;hort &s;eems to have no plea&s;ure on earth, except that of heaping up money. Not &s;o her younger &s;i&s;ter; &s;he takes care to &s;pend to the very extremity of her income. She takes great delight in dre&s;s, equipage, and every &s;pecies of luxury, but her expences of the &s;howy kind never prevent the exertions of her humanity: there pa&s;&s;es no week in which &s;he does not di&s;tribute, on an ap|pointed day, money, cloaths, and victuals to a number of beggars, who crowd around her door to be relieved." "This la&s;t cou&s;in of mine," &s;aid our Indian, "I like well enough, by your account; but as to the other, not a penny of mine &s;hall &s;he have, to add to her heaps, an old avaricious &s;kin-flint!"</P>
<P>With the&s;e &s;entiments, John Sterling &s;et out to vi&s;it his younge&s;t relation. From her he met with a polite and ho&s;pitable reception, and de|parted from her hou&s;e in a perfect good humour with her and her manner of living.</P>
<P>It happened that the only maid &s;ervant who lived with the elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, was acquainted in the family of the per&s;on from whom Sterling had received his intelligence concerning the characters of the two &s;i&s;ters. Some of the do|me&s;tics had overheard the conver&s;ation, and took the fir&s;t opportunity to reproach the girl for the par&s;imony of her mi&s;tre&s;s, which they told her had lo&s;t her the &s;haring of a fine &s;um of
<PB N="268" REF="030190_0273_0FE5074E810CD838">
money. This &s;oon reached the ears of the fe|male mi&s;er, who&s;e vexation, at hearing what &s;he had mi&s;&s;ed, was almo&s;t in&s;upportable. The large fortune, which by dint of the mo&s;t penu|rious economy &s;he had &s;craped together, now appeared to her le&s;s than nothing, when &s;he con&s;idered the immen&s;e trea&s;ures of her cou&s;in, all of which &s;he thought might have been her own, had &s;he but managed &s;o as to gain the good graces of the owner. "Perhaps," &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf, "it may not, even now, be too late to retrieve my error. Some of my money I mu&s;t &s;acrifice, it is true, but then if I &s;ucceed, I &s;hall be nobly reimbur&s;ed. It will go to my heart, indeed, to part with what has been the whole joy of my life to procure, but I &s;ee no other chance in my favour, and this &s;cheme mu&s;t be tried." Having taken her re&s;olution, &s;he determined, as the fir&s;t &s;tep, to contrive to fall into company with her opulent relation. This &s;he &s;oon brought about, by meeting him at her &s;i&s;ter's, where he was almo&s;t always to be found. She now endeavoured, by every win|ing grace in her power to captivate his atten|tion, and when &s;he thought &s;he had in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;ucceeded, &s;he took an opportunity to reproach him for appearing to have forgotten that he had &s;uch a relation as her&s;elf. "No, Madam," &s;aid the blunt Sterling, "I had by no means forgotten you, but the plain truth is, that finding on inquiry, that your turn and mine were as widely different as light and dark|ne&s;s, I thought that no good could ari&s;e from any connexion between us." "I comprehend you, Sir," (replied the lady,) you have heard
<PB N="269" REF="030190_0274_0FE50756EA349890">
me repre&s;ented in the mo&s;t odious colours, as a pattern of meanne&s;s and avarice. How cruel is the tongue of defamation! I have laid up mo|ney, it is true, but Heaven knows with what intent! The &s;ervice of my indigent fellow-crea|tures has been my real motive, and it was only to ama&s;s a &s;um &s;ufficient to lay the foundation of a new Ho&s;pital, that I have deprived my&s;elf of not only the <HI>&s;uperfluities,</HI> but almo&s;t of the <HI>nece&s;&s;aries</HI> of life. At length I have attained to my wi&s;h, and to-morrow I intend to depo&s;it, in the hands of proper tru&s;tees, five hundred guineas, which I mean to be laid out in the purcha&s;e of land for the edifice to &s;tand upon." The hone&s;t Indian was completely taken in by this manoeuvre. "How unju&s;tly," &s;aid he to him&s;elf, "have I thought of this poor woman! Here has &s;he denied her&s;elf every gratification for the &s;ake of the poor, and I have looked on her as a &s;elf-intere&s;ted mi&s;er! Well, well, I mu&s;t contrive to make her amends." Then turning to the lady, "Madam," &s;aid he, "hither|to I have mi&s;taken your character, but I now honour you as much as a few hours pa&s;t I de&s;|pi&s;ed you. But you mu&s;t not prevent me from &s;haring with you the merit of the noble work which you have taken in hand; to-morrow I will attend upon you, and will add my part to the do|nation which you are about to make." He kept his word, and accompanied her the next morn|ing: he then &s;aw her make a depo&s;it of the &s;um which &s;he had mentioned, to which he joined a much more con&s;iderable pre&s;ent for the &s;ame charitable purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The worthy Sterling was recounting the ad|ventures
<PB N="270" REF="030190_0275_0FE5075A6B2804F8">
of the day to his friend, and was tell|ing him how very unju&s;tly he had thought of the elder of his cou&s;ins, when he was told that an old dome&s;tic of the family earne&s;tly entreat|ed to &s;peak with him. "Perhaps," &s;aid the good Ea&s;t Indian, "he may need my a&s;&s;i&s;tance; let him come in." The poor fellow entered. "Can I, my good friend, be of any &s;ervice to you?" &s;aid Sterling. "I am very unfortunate," &s;aid the &s;uppliant, "and it is only the report which I have heard of your goodne&s;s, which has tempted me to this application. I lived twenty years in the &s;ervice of your worthy un|cle: I married, and when I lo&s;t my good ma&s;|ter, I &s;et up a little &s;hop: when I was going on with tolerable &s;ucce&s;s, I was utterly ruined by an unfortunate fire, which con&s;umed my whole &s;tock. Since that cruel event I have been unable to provide for my young and nu|merous family, and I now pre&s;ume to hope that your goodne&s;s will enable me to put my poor children into &s;ome way of bu&s;ine&s;s."</P>
<P>"But why, in the name of wonder, did you not apply to my two cou&s;ins!" "Alas, good Sir, I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to them in the begin|ing of my misfortunes; but from the elde&s;t I met with a po&s;itive refu&s;al; and the other lady, though &s;he offered me &s;ome relief, yet &s;he ac|companied that offer with the condition of my coming publicly along with other poor, to re|ceive charity at her door; and indeed, Sir, it appeared hard to one who had been a reputable, trade&s;man, to be reduced to beg his bread at a door in a public &s;treet. No Sir, I rather cho&s;e
<PB N="271" REF="030190_0276_0FE5075BF6CA5E00">
to get into a &s;ervice, which I fortunately con|trived to do."</P>
<P>"And what my good friend became then of your children?"</P>
<P>"My elde&s;t daughter, Sir, has had the hap|pine&s;s of being protected by your Honour's cou&s;in, Madam Sophia, who is goodne&s;s it&s;elf, and who, although in very narrow circum&s;tan|ces, yet finds opportunities of doing a thou&s;and good actions."</P>
<P>"How?" &s;aid the good Sterling, "and have I another cou&s;in? And is &s;he poor, and yet is &s;he charitable? And have I, like a blockhead as I am, been ignorant of her very exi&s;tence?"</P>
<P>"There is &s;uch a one, I a&s;&s;ure you, Sir; &s;he is the daughter of your uncle, and young|e&s;t of the three &s;i&s;ters."</P>
<P>"Is this po&s;&s;ible?" &s;aid the Ea&s;t Indian, "and if &s;o, how comes it about that neither of her &s;i&s;ters have mentioned her name <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">? Where has &s;he lived? How came &s;he &s;o poor?"</P>
<P>"The good lady, Sir, tru&s;ted her fortune in the hands of a merchant who became a bank|rupt, and lo&s;t nearly the whole of it. She then retired, with what little &s;he had remaining, to a village in the country, where &s;he boarded at the hou&s;e of a friend of her's who married a clergyman. There, from her &s;mall income, &s;he found means to be of infinite &s;ervice to her poor neighbours; &s;he vi&s;ited the &s;ick, &s;he in|&s;tructed the young, and by her example and advice, &s;he reclaimed the idle, and encouraged the worthy members of &s;ociety. As to her name not being mentioned to you by her &s;i&s;|ters, I fear their motive for keeping you in ig|norance
<PB N="272" REF="030190_0277_0FE5075F77C93C18">
concerning her, was their con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of her &s;uperior claim to your favour and protection."</P>
<P>"This," cried Sterling, "is the exact per|&s;on that I am looking for. Come, my lad, get your boots ready, to-morrow you &s;hall be my guide to the village where this precious cou&s;in of mine re&s;ides; trouble your&s;elf no more about your children; they &s;hall hence forward be <HI>my</HI> care: and as to your&s;elf, quit your &s;ervice as &s;oon as you can with decency; you are too old to wear a livery, I will provide for you com|fortably for the re&s;t of your life."</P>
<P>"Oh, Sir," &s;aid the old &s;ervant, "be a&s;&s;ured that what is left of that life &s;hall be employed in praying for ble&s;&s;ings on you, and on my kind benefactre&s;s Madam Sophia."</P>
<P>Sterling &s;oon reached the village. He alight|ed at the par&s;onage, and inquired of the mini&s;|ter concerning his amiable cou&s;in. "She is an angel," &s;aid the prie&s;t; "notwith&s;tanding the lo&s;s of her fortune, her countenance expre&s;&s;es the happy tranquillity of her mind. Nothing, in &s;hort, can deprive her of her benevolence, and that benevolence mu&s;t always in&s;ure her tranquillity." "Tell her, I entreat you, Sir," &s;aid Sterling, "that a relation, whom &s;he has never &s;een, begs to be introduced to her." So|phia received her cou&s;in with unaffected regard and natural politene&s;s. "I am enchanted with you, my &s;weet cou&s;in!" &s;aid the Ea&s;t Indian. "In your mode&s;t, neat, linen gown, you look more like a woman of fa&s;hion than your &s;howy &s;i&s;ter in her gaye&s;t dre&s;&s;es; and poor as you are, your features are illuminated by an air of con|tent
<PB N="273" REF="030190_0278_0FE50769B0591B10">
which never appears on the vi&s;age of that other &s;i&s;ter of yours; that rich lady that founds ho&s;pitals! But tell me now, hone&s;tly, cou&s;in Sophy, how has it happened that neither of my cou&s;ins ever made mention of your name to me &s;ince my arrival? Have you fallen out with them? Or do they not know where you re&s;ide?"</P>
<P>"Believe me, Sir," replied Sophia, "I love them both too well to keep them in ignorance of my place of abode, and within the&s;e la&s;t three days I have written to each of them." "Hard-hearted wretches!" exclaimed the good Sterling; "can I ever forget their indifference to &s;o amiable a relation?" "Excu&s;e them this one time," &s;aid the gentle Sophia; "I doubt not but that they meant to have made me amends for this omi&s;&s;ion, by the future kind|ne&s;s of their behaviour." "No, no," &s;aid her cou&s;in, "I know the vilene&s;s of their hearts. They were con&s;cious of your &s;uperior merit, and dreaded, le&s;t I &s;hould reward it by be&s;tow|ing on you that fortune which each of them al|ready gra&s;ped as her own: but their odious cunning and greedine&s;s &s;hall be di&s;appointed. To your o&s;tentatious &s;i&s;ter I will not give one farthing; &s;he does good, indeed, but it is merely for the &s;ake of being talked of abroad as a woman of unbounded charity. Your pe|nurious &s;i&s;ter I am &s;till le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to encou|rage. The donation which &s;he has made in fa|vour of the poor, has her own intere&s;t &s;o im|mediately in view, that it gives me infinitely more <HI>di&s;gu&s;t</HI> than <HI>plea&s;ure. You,</HI> my worthy cou&s;in, who do good actions merely becau&s;e it is right and fitting to do them, <HI>you</HI> I declare
<PB N="274" REF="030190_0279_0FE5081964C836C8">
to be my &s;ole inheritrix; and from this mo|ment I in&s;i&s;t on your making u&s;e of my fortune as if it were your own. I know that fortune is by no means nece&s;&s;ary to your happine&s;s; but I know, at the &s;ame time, that <HI>your</HI> being rich will be the means of communicating happine&s;s to numbers of &s;ufferers, whom, until now, you could only pity and not relieve."</P>

<HEAD>THE CONTRAST.</HEAD>
<P>FREDERIC was the &s;on of a lady of fortune, who, having retired to her e&s;tate in the coun|try, be&s;towed mo&s;t of her time on his educa|tion. In return for her attachment to him, Frederic was mode&s;t, &s;tudious, and humane; he felt the obligations which he was under to his parent, and did his be&s;t to requite them by pur&s;uing her in&s;tructions with care, and by preferring her company to that of any other per&s;on. Jacob, a lad of the &s;ame age with Fre|deric, and who&s;e mother's cottage &s;tood near the park-pale of the lady we have ju&s;t &s;poken of, was in every re&s;pect of a character directly oppo&s;ite to that of his amiable neighbour. He
<PB N="275" REF="030190_0280_0FE5081AF1907A00">
was loved by no one, not even by his poor mo|ther, all who&s;e endeavours could never prevail on him even to take the pains of learning to read. The mo&s;t innocent way in which he &s;pent his time was in loitering from place to place, and lounging about; at other &s;ea&s;ons he was the plague of his comrades, and, in con&s;equence, the dete&s;tation of the village. Frederic was too well bred up to choo&s;e &s;o vile a boy for a play-fellow; Jacob, however, taking advan|tage of the opportunities which the &s;ituation of his mother's tenement gave him, &s;tole, one day, into the room where Frederic's playthings were kept, broke to pieces his violin and his chariot, completely &s;poilt his bird organ, and carried off in triumph his hobby hor&s;e.</P>
<P>The author of this mi&s;chief was &s;oon di&s;|covered, and Frederic, in the fir&s;t emotions of re&s;entment, was running, by the advice of a &s;er|vant, to acquaint the mother of Jacob with the exploits of her &s;on. "But, no," &s;aid he checking his &s;peed, "&s;he is a &s;evere woman, and &s;he will hor&s;ewhip him without mercy, and, may be, &s;hut him up in an out-hou&s;e for a week together. How &s;hould I like that for my&s;elf? No, no, I had better forgive him, for this once."</P>
<P>Not long after this, Frederic was walking out with his beloved mother, when unluckily they &s;trolled near a place where the thoughtle&s;s, wicked Jacob was amu&s;ing him&s;elf by throwing &s;tones with all his little force at every object within his reach, totally regardle&s;s of the mi&s;|chief which he might occa&s;ion. One of the&s;e unluckily hit the little Frederic on the head,
<PB N="276" REF="030190_0281_0FE5081EEDD36E18">
and fetched the blood; but Frederic was too much of a man to cry at a little pain.&mdash;"Ma|ma," &s;aid the &s;pirited lad, "this &s;tone has hurt me a little, but I dare &s;ay the pain will &s;oon be over." As his forehead, however, was all covered with blood, his mother went directly home with him and had every proper care taken of his wound. It was an ugly one, and brought on a fever, and it was the end of &s;even or eight days before he was permitted to walk out, and his mother being engaged with company, ordered a &s;ervant to accompany him. As they were walking, the di&s;cour&s;e turned on the wickedne&s;s of Jacob: and ju&s;t as the do|me&s;tic was hopeing that they might &s;ee nothing of him during their walk, they heard a ru&s;tling noi&s;e in a tree behind them, and down, at once, came Jacob, &s;creaming and crying, from the top of an elm, which his u&s;ual &s;pirit of mi&s;chief had tempted him to climb in pur&s;uit of a crow's ne&s;t. "I fear," &s;aid Frederic, exerting his ut|mo&s;t endeavours to rai&s;e the poor wretch, "that you have hurt your&s;elf &s;adly." Jacob &s;till con|tinued his groans and cries; and well he might, for, upon examination, his leg appeared to be, broken in two places, "Poor fellow," &s;aid the benevolent Frederic, "how he mu&s;t &s;uffer! let us contrive &s;ome how or other, to convey him home to his mother.&mdash;Unhappy woman! what di&s;tre&s;s mu&s;t &s;he not feel when &s;he &s;ees the condition of her unlucky &s;on!" Her di&s;tre&s;s was great indeed. "Poor as I am," &s;he ex|claimed, "I can ju&s;t &s;upport my&s;elf and this ungracious lad; but how &s;hall I ever be able to pay the long demand which the &s;urgeon will
<PB N="277" REF="030190_0282_0FE5082AB4ED9368">
have upon me, by the time that Jacob reco|vers." Little Frederic, who was a witne&s;s to her complaints, afforded to them tho&s;e tears which his own &s;uffering could never extort from him.&mdash;"Make your&s;elf ea&s;y, my good neigh|bour," &s;aid the amiable boy, "and oblige me &s;o far as to accept this new crown-piece, which my good Mama has ju&s;t given me that I might buy me a fairing, but I can do without it bet|ter than <HI>you</HI> can." The afflicted mother looked at him with &s;ilent admiration. Frederic pro|ceeded to a&s;&s;ure her, that he was con&s;cious of the &s;mallne&s;s of the &s;um, (though it was his all) he would u&s;e his intere&s;t with his parent for a larger &s;upply, and did not doubt to obtain it. The unfortunate woman now found her tongue, and expre&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t affecting terms, her a&s;toni&s;hment at &s;eeing his earne&s;tne&s;s in reliev|ing that worthle&s;s lad, by who&s;e mi&s;chievous hand his forehead was <HI>&s;till</HI> &s;marting. "This," &s;aid &s;he, "is <HI>truly</HI> to return good for evil!" Frederic now returned to his mother, and after giving her the hi&s;tory of the whole occurrence, "How comes it, Mama," &s;aid he, "that al|though I was truly &s;orry for poor Jacob's mi&s;|fortune, and though I feel both for him and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> mother, yet, on the whole, I am more <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> than <HI>grieved?</HI>" "Child," &s;aid the lady, "you have had an opportunity of doing well, and you have made u&s;e of it; and, believe me, throughout life you will find, that the con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having done a benevolent action will be the mo&s;t effectual cordial for every painful &s;en&s;ation."</P>

<HEAD>FATAL EFFECTS OF DELAY.</HEAD>
<P>CHARLES STANLEY was the &s;econd &s;on of a gentleman, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;mall e&s;tate in York&s;hire, (Old England) which at his death was de&s;igned for his elde&s;t &s;on, and the young|e&s;t was to be brought up to &s;ome genteel bu&s;i|ne&s;s, by which he might improve the little for|tune which his father intended for him. Charles gave early marks of a &s;weet and engaging tem|per; he was dutiful to his parents, he tenderly loved his brother, and was &s;o obliging to the &s;ervants, that he became the favourite with them all. Every little boy in the village talk|ed of the good nature of little Charles, and of his willingne&s;s to part with his &s;weetmeats and playthings.</P>
<P>When Charles was about four years old, his father &s;ent him to a neighbouring &s;chool, where he was very &s;oon as much remarked for the progre&s;s he made in learning as he had been for his &s;weet temper. He read better than any boy in the &s;chool, and whenever he went be|fore
<PB N="290" REF="030190_0295_0FE50869C6FF6D78">
his ma&s;ter to &s;pell, he was certain to get the fir&s;t place. This great quickne&s;s gave much delight to his fond parents and his tutor, though they ob&s;erved that with all his good qualities, Charles had one capital fault; in&s;tead of going directly to &s;chool he would often loiter in the fields till long after the other boys had gone in, and his books were always to be &s;ought for at the very time when he &s;hould have taken them to his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>At a proper age, Charles was placed by his father at a great &s;chool, where he no longer found the indulgence to his faults, which he had met with from the village tutor. He was not allowed to defer the morning's ta&s;k till the afternoon, and it was remarked to him that he was inferior in learning to many who were his juniors in age. Charles was &s;tung with the re|mark; he knew that he was able to excel, and he re&s;olved that he would at &s;ome time take great pains, and obtain the &s;ame rank he had held in the village &s;chool; but he thought he might defer this till &s;ome future time. His work, while he was under the eye of his ma&s;ter, was performed as well, and in le&s;s time than that of mo&s;t of his &s;chool-fellows; but the ta&s;ks which he had to perform out of &s;chool hours were always deferred, and everything furni&s;hed Charles with an excu&s;e for delay; not that he pa&s;&s;ed his vacant time in play; in&s;tead of that he was often employed in writing exerci&s;es for his &s;chool-fellows while they were amu&s;ing them&s;elves, and his own ta&s;k was deferred till the morning, when there was little time to per|form it well, and he was puni&s;hed for the faults.
<PB N="291" REF="030190_0296_0FE5086BA32709E8">
Thus poor Charles &s;eldom enjoyed the proper &s;ea&s;on for play. He was compelled to com|plete his ta&s;k, when his companions were en|joying them&s;elves in innocent &s;ports, and he was &s;eldom &s;et free from work till they were retiring to re&s;t.</P>
<P>Charles continued in this &s;ituation till the age of fourteen, and was every day remarked for his abilities to excel, and for tho&s;e habits of de|lay which often de&s;troyed all the advantages he naturally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Mr. Stanley then took him to London, and placed him with a Mer|chant, a friend of his, in the city, to whom he hoped Charles would become &s;o agreeable, as in time to be admitted into partner&s;hip with him. In this &s;ituation Charles gave the &s;trong|e&s;t proofs of integrity, &s;weet temper, and great abilities, but delay attended whatever he under|took; he was not dre&s;&s;ed till &s;ome hours after he &s;hould be at the de&s;k; he did not get to the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e till the books were &s;hut, nor appear upon Change, till every man of bu|&s;ine&s;s had de&s;erted it. With more virtues, and greater ability, than almo&s;t any man of his ac|quaintance, he became a general object of ridicule and deri&s;ion, and when the term of his apprentice&s;hip expired, he found that, with a character which was &s;haded with only one foible, all intimate connexions with him were &s;hunned by the &s;ober part of the trading world.</P>
<P>About this time Charles had the misfortune to lo&s;e his father, who bequeathed him &s;uch a fortune as entitled him to expect a partner&s;hip in &s;ome re&s;pectable hou&s;e. But his known ha|bit of delay prevented his friends from making
<PB N="292" REF="030190_0297_0FE5086D37DEFA80">
the offer; and though he fully intended to &s;eek &s;uch a connexion, yet he continued to defer it till he had greatly le&s;&s;ened his little patrimony. His father had introduced him to &s;everal friends who might have a&s;&s;i&s;ted him greatly, but he had di&s;gu&s;ted them by his conduct, by deferring his vi&s;its to un&s;ea&s;onable hours, and by protracting them till the repeated yawns of the family informed him that it was time to de|part. Charles, who &s;aw him&s;elf in a &s;ituation where he was very likely to be without either friends or fortune, now re&s;olved to exert him|&s;elf, and to follow the plan which his father had traced out for his conduct in life. He could not, indeed, meet with an agreeable partner&s;hip, but he determined to enter into a mercantile line by him&s;elf; and his friends, who were delighted with his exertions, formed &s;uch exten&s;ive connexions for him, that he had the greate&s;t chance of being in a few years one of the riche&s;t men in the city. But alas! his habit of delay had acquired more &s;trength than he was aware of, and his efforts to conquer it were but tran&s;ient. Charles &s;oon relap&s;ed into his former indolence. He deferred bu&s;ine&s;s till he had not time to tran&s;act it. He neglect|ed to comply with the orders of his corre&s;pond|ents till the goods they &s;ent for were no longer wanted; and he omitted in&s;uring his ve&s;&s;els, not becau&s;e he intended to ri&s;k the lo&s;s, but becau&s;e, as he did not &s;ee them &s;inking he thought he might defer the bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;ome future <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">. In a &s;hort time his bu&s;ine&s;s de|clined, &s;everal of his ve&s;&s;els had either been ta|ken or lo&s;t, his creditors poured in from every
<PB N="293" REF="030190_0298_0FE50870A0CF2798">
quarter, his property could not an&s;wer their demands; and Charles Stanley, who&s;e integrity was re&s;pected by all, was hurried to pri&s;on, with the conviction that his misfortunes were the con&s;equence of his folly.</P>
<P>In this wretched &s;ituation Charles was a prey to &s;orrow. His heart was melted at the mi&s;ery which many poor and innocent families mu&s;t have &s;uffered from his failure; and he thought of the unea&s;ine&s;s he mu&s;t have given to his mo|ther with agony. Firmly did he re&s;olve, that if he could ever again be e&s;tabli&s;hed, he would atone by his future diligence for his pa&s;t mi&s;|conduct; but where could he look for a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance? His mother had no more than was &s;uffi|cient for her &s;upport; and his brother had al|ready given him whatever he could afford. Charles was &s;itting alone, reflecting upon the &s;ad &s;ituation of his affairs, when he was inform|ed that a gentleman inquired for him below, and in a few moments he beheld a brother of his mother's, whom the family had believed to be dead, but who was ju&s;t returned from India with a large fortune. Mr. Hilton was much grieved at the mi&s;conduct and misfortunes of his nephew; but was &s;o much affected by his in|genuous account of his pa&s;t faults, and his re&s;o|lutions of amendment, that he generou&s;ly di&s;|charged all his debts, and enabled him to ap|pear again among&s;t his old acquaintance with credit.</P>
<P>Charles, fully &s;en&s;ible of the mi&s;eries from which he had been delivered, was very earne&s;t to &s;ettle him&s;elf in &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s which would afford him &s;upport; and his kind uncle, who
<PB N="294" REF="030190_0299_0FE5088013EBAF88">
hoped that a new &s;cene would be favourable to his new-formed plans, earne&s;tly advi&s;ed him to embark for India, promi&s;ing to return with him that he might &s;ee him well &s;ettled. This good|ne&s;s filled the heart of Charles with the warme&s;t gratitude; he fell at his feet, and declared with tears, that he would exert him&s;elf to the utmo&s;t to fulfil the commands of his generous bene|factor. Every thing was ordered for their de|parture, and when the time arrived for the &s;ail|ing of the &s;hip, Mr. Hilton went on board with &s;ome goods which were in readine&s;s, leaving his nephew to follow him to the Downs with tho&s;e which were not quite fini&s;hed. But de|lay again appeared in the conduct of Charles; he omitted inquiring after them till an expre&s;s arrived from Mr. Hilton, with the account that the ve&s;&s;el was to &s;ail the next day, and that he mu&s;t ha&s;ten down immediately. Charles then began to execute the orders which his uncle had left, but was detained &s;o long before he could get the goods, that when he reached the Downs he found the &s;hip had &s;ailed &s;ome hours. Almo&s;t di&s;tracted with this account, and with the thoughts of what his kind uncle mu&s;t think of his mi&s;conduct, he wandered about for &s;ome time in the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, and at length having become almo&s;t de&s;perate, he hired a quick-&s;ailing boat, in hopes of being able to overtake the &s;hip. For &s;ome time they ad|vanced rapidly, and gained &s;ight of the India &s;hip, and the heart of Charles was alternately agitated by hope and fear. But &s;uddenly the &s;ky was overca&s;t, the &s;ea &s;welled, the wind roared, and the boatmen declared that there
<PB N="295" REF="030190_0300_0FE5088D169455A0">
was every appearance of an approaching &s;torm, which &s;oon raged round them with the utmo&s;t fury. The ve&s;&s;el, which was too light to re|&s;i&s;t its force, was to&s;&s;ed about at the mercy of the wind and waves, and the only hope the un|happy Charles had of &s;aving his own life, and tho&s;e of his companions, was by reaching the &s;hip which they &s;aw at a &s;mall di&s;tance before them. But they exerted every effort in vain; a great &s;ea broke over the bark, and Mr. Hil|ton had the mi&s;ery of &s;eeing it &s;ink for ever into the bo&s;om of the ocean, and to lament the lo&s;s of the unfortunate Charles, who, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch talents as made him loved and admired by all, yet by one unhappy foible was rendered mi&s;erable and ridiculous through life, and &s;ubjected to a dreadful and premature death.</P>

<HEAD>THE NOSEGAY.</HEAD>
<P>CAPTAIN DORMER, and his amiable La|dy, had lived during &s;everal years at their &s;eat in Dor&s;et&s;hire, happy in them&s;elves, and beloved by all around them, when they re|ceived the unwelcome account that the Captain was commanded to join his regiment, which
<PB N="296" REF="030190_0301_0FE5088EA1AE0A30">
was ordered to embark for America. The news of this event filled all the country with &s;orrow. The rich grieved for the lo&s;s of &s;o excellent a neighbour; the poor mourned for the departure of their kind and con&s;tant bene|factor; and the tenants and &s;ervants wept aloud at the thoughts of being &s;eparated from a ma&s;|ter who had always treated them more like children than dependants. But in vain were their intreaties that he would remain; honour called upon him to depart, and Mrs. Dormer &s;aw, with the utmo&s;t &s;orrow, that to honour he would &s;acrifice the &s;tronge&s;t feelings of his brea&s;t. She re&s;olved, however, not to be left behind, and in a &s;hort time they exchanged the tranquil plea&s;ures of Belmount, for the horrors of carnage and war.</P>
<P>Mrs. Dormer had not been long in America before &s;he lay-in of twins, both daughters, and very beautiful. In the care of the&s;e &s;weet children &s;he found &s;ome relief during the fre|quent ab&s;ences of her hu&s;band, and would oft|en indulge the hope of returning peace, when the Captain, in&s;tead of engaging in the &s;laugh|ter of his fellow-creatures, might enjoy the delight of improving his little Fanny and So|phia. The children daily became more fond of their parents, often clinging to their father when they &s;aw him preparing to go out, and always clapping their little hands with joy when they &s;aw him return. As &s;oon as they were able to &s;peak, Mrs. Dormer taught them to &s;ay Papa, and in a &s;hort time, when they &s;aw him at a di&s;tance, they would directly leave their play, and running up to Mama, would
<PB N="297" REF="030190_0302_0FE508902FC3F760">
cry out, <Q>Papa is come, dear papa is come to &s;ee his little girls.</Q></P>
<P>The improvement of the children became more vi&s;ible every day, and they were daily more dear to their parents, when Captain Dor|mer, returning from a foraging party, was fiercely and &s;uddenly attacked by the Indians, and a de&s;perate engagement en&s;ued. The time when Mrs. Dormer had expected his return had long pa&s;&s;ed, and &s;he &s;at in &s;ilent agony look|ing at her dear children, whom at one moment &s;he feared were deprived of their parent, and the next, &s;tepping to the room door, &s;he anxi|ou&s;ly li&s;tened to every noi&s;e, and was fearful, le&s;t even the &s;ound of her own breath &s;hould prevent her from hearing the well-known &s;tep of her beloved hu&s;band. At length a &s;ound reached her ears&mdash;it came nearer; it increa&s;ed, and &s;he flew down &s;tairs in the fond hope of welcoming the return of what was mo&s;t dear to her. The door was opened, but it no longer opened to admit the tender hu&s;band and fond father joyfully returning from the labours of the day; Captain Dormer was brought in a mangled lifele&s;s corp&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus cruelly deprived of her hu&s;band, Mrs. Dormer re&s;olved to return to England, and to employ her time in the education of her little girls. She took them down into Dor&s;et&s;hire, and in&s;tructed them her&s;elf; and little Fanny and Sophia Dormer were &s;oon remarked as the neate&s;t work-women in the country. But their good Mama did not direct their attention merely to the little arts of making trifling or|naments: &s;he taught them that virtue was &s;u|perior
<PB N="298" REF="030190_0303_0FE50893B42E3B08">
to accompli&s;hments, and that what was u&s;eful was more excellent than what was merely elegant. Little Fanny &s;oon under&s;tood, that though mu&s;ic gave her great delight, it was &s;till more delightful by her own &s;weetne&s;s to charm all around her; and Sophia learned that no plea&s;ure was equal to the plea&s;ure of doing good to her fellow-creatures.</P>
<P>In this happy retirement Mrs. Dormer con|tinued for &s;ome years improving her &s;weet girls in real virtue and u&s;eful knowledge. At this time Lady Aubrey, a relation of Mrs. Dormer's paid her a vi&s;it, and upon her re|turn would gladly have prevailed with the good mother to &s;uffer both her daughters to &s;pend &s;ome time with her in London. This, how|ever, Mrs. Dormer could not agree to; but as Fanny had &s;hown a &s;trong affection for her La|dy&s;hip, and earne&s;tly wi&s;hed to &s;ee London, &s;he con&s;ented to her going; and Sophia, who preferred the company of her Mama to any other enjoyment, was left at home. At fir&s;t indeed, &s;he felt unea&s;y without her &s;i&s;ter; &s;he found a &s;olo on the harp&s;ichord was not half &s;o agreeable as a duet, and the beautiful alcove in the garden was not near &s;o plea&s;ant, as when Fanny &s;at with her there, at her drawing or needle-work. By degrees, however, &s;he be|came reconciled to her lo&s;s, but frequently thought that Fanny could not enjoy half the plea&s;ure in London that &s;he did at Belmount, in a&s;&s;i&s;ting her Mama to work for the poor people of the village, or in going with her to vi&s;it tho&s;e who were &s;ick. But her greate&s;t de|light was in the office which Mrs. Dormer had
<PB N="299" REF="030190_0304_0FE5089DC46588B8">
given her of di&s;tributing the broken victuals, which were given away to the poor every day at her gate. This was the highe&s;t plea&s;ure Sophia could receive. She &s;lew with rapture to the hou&s;e keeper to obtain her welcome burden, under which &s;he tottered to the door. She exulted in &s;eeing &s;o many poor creatures made happy by her bounty, and delighted to hear them &s;ay, <Q>Here comes the good little girl; &s;he will, one day, be as good a lady as her Mama;</Q> and &s;he often thought with great plea&s;ure of the joy which her &s;i&s;ter Fanny would have, when &s;he returned, in this new employment.</P>
<P>But Fanny's vi&s;it to Lady Aubrey unfitted her for the innocent plea&s;ures of Belmount. She never heard of &s;uch a thing as working for the poor from her Lady&s;hip; and cards, dre&s;s, and elegant equipages, engaged the attention of all the circles to which Fanny was admitted. She almo&s;t learned to forget the poor; and when &s;he returned to Belmount, &s;he &s;poke haughtily to the &s;ervants, and &s;carcely noticed her inferiors; and when the poor came to re|ceive their daily allowance, in&s;tead of &s;erving them, &s;he either turned away, or &s;uffered her little favourite dog, Surly, to bark at them, and &s;hake their tattered cloaths. All the village talked of her pride, and lamented that the good Mrs. Dormer &s;hould have &s;uch a naughty little girl; but the good and gentle Sophia was loved by them all. They pre&s;ented her with the choice&s;t flowers in their gardens, and the mo&s;t beautiful bantams and pea-fowls were &s;ent to the poultry-yard of the good little girl that be|haved
<PB N="300" REF="030190_0305_0FE5089F50E59B78">
&s;o well to every one. When Mrs. Dor|mer came from church, all the farmers and their wives made their be&s;t bows and curt&s;ies to the good lady, who &s;poke kindly to them all. She was followed by Fanny, who never turned her head a&s;ide; but when Sophia came near, the children plucked one another, and &s;aid, <Q>Here comes the good young lady, &s;ee how good humoured &s;he looks: &s;he will a&s;k us all how we do.</Q></P>
<P>Fanny could not avoid &s;eeing how di&s;agree|able her pride made her to every body, and &s;he found her&s;elf much le&s;s happy than &s;he was be|fore &s;he went to London; but &s;he had learned there to think that &s;uch behaviour was right, and, if it was an error, &s;he fooli&s;hly re&s;olved ra|ther to adhere to it than to own &s;he had been wrong. She was one day invited with her &s;i&s;ter to a ball at the hou&s;e of a lady in the neighbour|hood, where &s;he was to meet all the young peo|ple in that country. Her heart exulted in the thoughts of this gay party, and &s;he re&s;olved to behave in the &s;ame manner &s;he had &s;een &s;ome fa&s;hionable ladies do in London. Upon enter|ing the room &s;he advanced to a &s;mall knot of young ladies of her acquaintance; and, without &s;peaking to the re&s;t of the company, began to make remarks upon their dre&s;s and manners in a whi&s;pering voice, but in a tone loud enough to be heard. After &s;ome time a young lady, whom &s;he had never &s;een before, entered the room, in a dre&s;s made up in a manner very dif|ferent from any that Fanny had ever ob&s;erved; &s;he directly began to &s;neer at her, and declared, that for her part &s;he was &s;urpri&s;ed &s;uch &s;trange
<PB N="302" REF="030190_0306_0FE508A0DC0080B8">
figures &s;hould think of mixing with people of fa&s;hion, and wondered where they came from. The young lady, confounded at &s;o rude a re|ception, retired to a corner, where &s;he was joined by the good humoured Sophia, who chatted with her till the lady of the hou&s;e re|turned into the room, and introduced her into the company as the elde&s;t daughter of the Duke of Dor&s;et, who was ju&s;t returned from a tour to France. Nothing could exceed the chagrin of Fanny, when &s;he found that the young lady whom &s;he had been ridiculing was the principal per&s;on in the company, and that the dre&s;s &s;he had de&s;pi&s;ed, was the admiration of all who &s;aw it. She had not the a&s;&s;urance to endea|vour to repair her fault by apologies, or to pre&s;s her acquaintance upon the lady whom &s;he had &s;o gro&s;sly affronted. Indeed &s;he &s;aw that nei|ther her excu&s;es nor intimacy would be accept|ed, and &s;he had the mortification of hearing her &s;i&s;ter Sophia receive a very pre&s;&s;ing invi|tation to Dor&s;et Hou&s;e, in which &s;he was not included.</P>
<P>Fanny was greatly mortified at this incident, and &s;he re&s;olved never to behave in &s;uch a man|ner again. She ought, indeed, directly to have endeavoured to conquer every feeling of pride, and to return to that behaviour which made her beloved by every body; but &s;he only re&s;olved that &s;he would not again laugh aloud at a &s;tranger in a genteel company, and run the ri&s;k of offending her &s;uperiors. As to the poor and mi&s;erable, &s;he thought them beneath her regard.</P>
<P>Some time after this, Fanny and Sophia were
<PB N="302" REF="030190_0307_0FE508A4478FE1F0">
again invited to the hou&s;e of a lady, whom, as Fanny regarded her as a per&s;on of great ta&s;te, &s;he was de&s;irous to plea&s;e her by appearance. She put on all her little finery, but found that one thing was nece&s;&s;ary to complete her dre&s;s, which was a No&s;egay, and this &s;he was deter|mined to buy when they reached the town. They &s;et off in the carriage, attended only by &s;ervants, and by Fanny's little dog, which ran at the &s;ide of the chariot. Fanny could talk of nothing but of calling at the flori&s;t's, and of the elegant No&s;egay with which &s;he &s;hould be adorned. At length they &s;aw a little tattered girl laying a&s;leep upon the &s;ide of the road, whom Surley directly attacked, and began to &s;hake her ragged cloaths. Sophia called him ha&s;tily away, and would have &s;ucceeded before he had awakened the poor little girl, but Fanny encouraged him to proceed; upon this the child &s;tarting up, aimed a blow at the dog, which he avoided, and made a &s;nap at her leg. The poor terrified girl then endeavoured to run away, but in running mi&s;&s;ed her &s;tep, and fell down the bank into the ditch. She had hurt her foot, and lay crying in the ditch till Sophia ordered the &s;ervant to take her up, and, contrary to the advice of Fanny, de&s;ired him to place her in the chariot that they might convey her home. She then began to comfort the poor child, and inquired about her hurt; but &s;he continued to cry out, "O my poor mammy, my poor mam|my, what will &s;he do, now I cannot run a|bout and beg for her and my daddy!" "Who is your mammy," &s;aid Sophia, "and what &s;hall we do for your foot?" "Oh! don't mind my
<PB N="303" REF="030190_0308_0FE508ADE11B6EF0">
foot," &s;aid the child, "give me only &s;ome bread for my poor mammy and daddy, and my little brother, and I don't care what becomes of my foot."</P>
<P>The child had &s;carcely fini&s;hed her &s;peech when the carriage &s;topped at the door of a cot|tage, which the little girl &s;aid was her home. When &s;he attempted to get out, &s;he found her|&s;elf unable to walk, and was obliged to be car|ried by the footman, who, accompanied by So|phia, entered the hou&s;e, while Fanny remained in the carriage &s;ullenly pouting at her &s;i&s;ter's conde&s;cen&s;ion, and very angry to be &s;o delayed. She was indeed &s;orry to &s;ee the poor child &s;o hurt, and when &s;he was taken out of the car|riage gave her what money &s;he could &s;pare; but &s;he took care to keep enough to buy her elegant No&s;egay. When Sophia entered the hou&s;e, &s;he found a &s;cene of mi&s;ery which &s;he could not have conceived. The father of the little girl had long laboured under an ague and fever, her mother was worn down with poverty and fatigue, and her little brother crying for hunger in a corner of a poor cottage, &s;trip|ed of almo&s;t of all its furniture, which had been &s;old to buy nece&s;&s;aries. Sophia found that little Sally had gone out in the morning to beg &s;omething for this afflicted family, and that, quite exhau&s;ted with hunger and fatigue, &s;he &s;et down upon the bank and cried her&s;elf to &s;leep. The tender heart of Sophia was greatly affected by this di&s;tre&s;s; &s;he empitied her pocket of every farthing which it contained, and gave it to the good woman of the hou&s;e, and would not keep enough to buy the collar which &s;he
<PB N="304" REF="030190_0309_0FE508B173F15918">
had once intended for her little favourite &s;quir|rel. She then prepared to leave the cottage, but before &s;he went, de&s;ired the poor people to get what was nece&s;&s;ary, and told them &s;he would &s;oon return with her good Mama, who would give them cloaths and victuals enough.</P>
<P>The &s;i&s;ters then proceeded to their vi&s;it. Fanny bought her No&s;egay, which was very beautiful: but the &s;weetne&s;s of Sophia, and the cheerfulne&s;s which the thoughts of the good action &s;he had been performing in&s;pired her with, made her &s;o agreeable, that all the com|pany were charmed with her, but paid little attention to Fanny. At night, when they re|turned, Mrs. Dormer noticed Fanny's No&s;e|gay, which, though it had begun to fade, was &s;till very beautiful. This plea&s;ed Fanny, and &s;he cried out, "Ah! Mama, I was &s;ure you would like it, it is &s;o very pretty, and my &s;i&s;ter liked it very much indeed." "Then why did &s;he not buy one?" &s;aid Mrs. Dormer; Fanny hung down her head, and in a faultering tone an&s;wered, "Becau&s;e &s;he had no money." Mrs. Dormer, &s;urpri&s;ed at this, for &s;he had given &s;ome to each of them that very morning, in|quired from Sophia what was become of it; Sophia then recounted to her mother the con|dition in which &s;he had &s;een the poor people at the cottage, but took care not to mention a word of Fanny's ill behaviour: &s;he then told her the way in which &s;he had di&s;po&s;ed of her money, and the promi&s;e &s;he had made of tak|ing her Mama to the cottage; and ended by begging that &s;he would go with he&punc; in the morning. Tran&s;ported with her conduct, Mrs.
<PB N="305" REF="030190_0310_0FE508B303C4EF70">
Dormer pre&s;&s;ed her virtuous child to her bo&s;om, and promi&s;ed to take care of the wretched fa|mily, for whom Sophia was &s;o much intere&s;ted. Then looking with anger at Fanny, &s;he &s;aid, "Did you then give nothing to the&s;e poor unhappy creatures?" Fanny hung down her head in &s;ilence, for &s;he was a&s;hamed to &s;peak; but Sophia &s;aid, "Oh yes, Mama, indeed &s;he gave them all the money &s;he had; except ju&s;t enough to buy her No&s;egay and a trinket for her little watch; and I am &s;ure if &s;he had gone into the cottage and &s;een their mi&s;ery, &s;he would have given them that too." "She &s;at at the door then," &s;aid Mrs. Dormer, "while you went in." Then turning to Fanny, "Proud and unfeeling girl," &s;aid &s;he, "who could pre|fer vain and trifling ornaments to the delight of relieving the &s;ick and mi&s;erable! Retire from my pre&s;ence; take with you your trinket and No&s;egay, and receive from them all the com|forts which they are able to be&s;tow."</P>
<P>Sophia would gladly have retired with her &s;i&s;ter; &s;he was grieved at the di&s;plea&s;ure &s;he had incurred from her Mama, and &s;he wi&s;hed earne&s;tly to &s;ooth and comfort the dejected Fanny. Mrs. Dormer, however, cho&s;e that &s;he &s;hould be left alone, and Fanny was obliged to pa&s;s the night by her&s;elf. She then began to reflect upon the happine&s;s which &s;he had known be|fore &s;he went to vi&s;it Lady Aubrey: &s;he was then beloved by every one, every body met her with a &s;mile; all the &s;ervants were ready to oblige her&punc; and all the neighbours loved her: now all was changed, and no one except Sophia, no, not even her Mama, &s;eemed to love her.
<PB N="306" REF="030190_0311_0FE508B48F64F2D0">
At this thought &s;he wept bitterly. "And why am I not beloved?" &s;aid &s;he. "And why does every one &s;hun me, at the very time that they are &s;o fond of my &s;i&s;ter? Alas! it is becau&s;e I am not &s;o good as &s;he." Fanny then thought of the vexatious &s;ituations into which &s;he had been brought by her vanity and pride. They had cau&s;ed her to be &s;hunned not only by her inferiors, but by tho&s;e above her, and had made her generally hated or de&s;pi&s;ed. Heartily a&s;ham|ed of her conduct, and grieved at its con&s;e|quences, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t part of the night in weeping, and re&s;olved that &s;he would again be good, and again behave in &s;uch a man|ner as &s;hould make her beloved by all, and hap|py in her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Towards morning Fanny fell a&s;leep, and, as &s;he was much tired with lying awake &s;o long, &s;he &s;lept till it was pretty late; the next day when &s;he awoke, &s;he inquired for her Mama, and was re&s;olved to a&s;k her forgivene&s;s, and to inform her of her &s;orrow for her pa&s;t faults, and her re&s;olutions to amend. She was informed that Mrs. Dormer and Sophia were gone to the cottage, and had taken cloaths, and other nece&s;&s;aries for the family, and had &s;ent for a phy&s;ician to attend the &s;ick man. "Ah!" &s;aid &s;he, "Sophia is happy, and &s;he de&s;erves to be &s;o, for &s;he is good; I was not worthy to have the plea&s;ure of going to the cottage, but I will begood and happy too." She then ro&s;e, and the fir&s;t thing &s;he &s;aw was her No&s;egay, which the maid had carefully put into a pot of water the night before. "This No&s;egay," &s;aid Fanny, "&s;hall be the con&s;tant memorial of my faults, and of my repentance." She then reach|ed
<PB N="307" REF="030190_0312_0FE508BA1E4E1E20">
her pallet, and making a beautiful &s;ketch of the almo&s;t dying flowers, &s;he wrote under them in a large hand, <HI>Virtue never fades,</HI> and placed the drawing in the mo&s;t con&s;picuous part of the room. When Mrs. Dormer returned, &s;he was &s;truck with this elegant performance, and calling for Fanny, had the delight of hearing from her&s;elf what had pa&s;&s;ed in her mind during the pa&s;t night, and her re&s;olutions of amend|ment. After &s;ome time, during which Fanny had entirely laid a&s;ide her haughty behaviour, the indulgent Mrs. Dormer would have re|moved the drawing that it might no longer mortify her child; but Fanny begged it might remain, and whenever &s;he found her&s;elf inclined to return to her former folly, &s;he placed her&s;elf before the picture, which &s;oon became, not merely the &s;hameful memorial of pa&s;t faults, but the elegant monument of her return to virtue.</P>

<HEAD>COURAGE INSPIRED BY FRIENDSHIP.</HEAD>
<P>Two &s;ailors, a Frenchman named Robert, and a native of Spain, called Antonio, were &s;laves to the &s;ame ma&s;ter at Algiers. Friend&s;hip is the only con&s;olation of per&s;ons in di&s;tre&s;s.
<PB N="308" REF="030190_0313_0FE508C416C9C168">
Antonio and Robert happily enjoyed this con&s;o|lation&mdash;they communicated to each other their mutual griefs; they conver&s;ed perpetually about their families, their countries, and of the exqui|&s;ite delight which the recovery of their liberty, &s;hould it ever be granted to their wi&s;hes, would afford them. Their conferences always ended in a flood of affectionate tears, and this expan|&s;ion of their hearts enabled them both to &s;up|port the hard labour, which was their daily lot, with uncommon fortitude.</P>
<P>The ta&s;k appointed them was the con&s;truc|tion of a road on the top of a cliff which over|hung the &s;ea. One morning the Spaniard re&s;t|ing for a moment from his toil, and ca&s;ting an anxious look on the &s;ea, "My friend," &s;aid he, "all my vows, all my hopes, are directed towards the oppo&s;ite bounds of that va&s;t liquid plain; why can I not, in company with the partner of my woes, attain tho&s;e happy &s;hores? My wife, my children, are ever before my eyes, eagerly longing for my arrival, or bit|terly lamenting my &s;uppo&s;ed death." Antonio perpetually indulged him&s;elf in the&s;e gloomy reflexions, and every day that he was &s;ummon|ed to his work on the cliff, he turned his eyes to the ocean, and regretted the fatal expan&s;e which &s;eparated him from his friends and his country.</P>
<P>It chanced that one day a Chri&s;tian &s;hip appeared at anchor not very di&s;tant from the &s;hore. "There friend", cried the Spaniard, "do you &s;ee that ve&s;&s;el? She brings us life and liberty. Though &s;he will not touch here, (for every one avoids the&s;e barbarous coa&s;ts) yet to|morrow
<PB N="309" REF="030190_0314_0FE508C811D44CF0">
if you choo&s;e it, Robert, our woes &s;hall end, and we will be free! Yes, to-morrow that &s;hip will pa&s;s within a league of the &s;hore, and we will plunge into the &s;ea from this rock, or peri&s;h in the attempt; for even death is preferable to this cruel &s;lavery." "If you can &s;ave your&s;elf," replied Robert, "I &s;hall &s;up|port my unhappy lot with greater re&s;ignation. You know, Antonio, how dear you are to me; my friend&s;hip for you will only terminate with my life. I have only one favour to a&s;k of you; endeavour to find out my father&mdash;If grief for my lo&s;s, and old age, have not already de|&s;troyed him, tell him"&mdash;"What do you mean?" an&s;wered Antonio; "I &s;eek your fa|ther!&mdash;And do you think I could live happily a &s;ingle moment with the idea of having left you in chains?" "But I cannot &s;wim," cried Robert; "and you know"&mdash;"I know that I have the &s;tronge&s;t friend&s;hip for you," replied the Spaniard, embracing him, and &s;hedding tears of affection: <Q>friend&s;hip will give me re|doubled &s;trength: you &s;hall hold upon my belt, and we will both &s;ave our&s;elves.</Q> In vain did Robert repre&s;ent the danger there would be of his peri&s;hing him&s;elf, and dragging his pre|&s;erver down with him to de&s;truction; nothing could overcome the re&s;olution of Antonio. <Q>We will both e&s;cape, or both peri&s;h toge|ther,</Q> he cried. "But we draw the attention of our &s;avage keepers; even &s;ome of our com|panions would be ba&s;e enough to betray us&mdash;Farewel&mdash;I hear the bell that calls us from our work; we mu&s;t &s;eparate; farewel till to-mor|row!"</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="030190_0315_0FE508C99CE7F2B8">
They now returned to their dungeon.&mdash;Antonio was wrapped up in the idea of his pro|ject: he fancied he had already pa&s;&s;ed the Mediterranean, and was in the arms of his friends, his wife, and his children. But Ro|bert formed to him&s;elf a very different picture: he &s;aw his friend falling a victim to his own genero&s;ity, and dragged by him to the bottom of the &s;ea, and peri&s;hing by that means, when, if he had only con&s;ulted his own &s;afety, he might have pre&s;erved him&s;elf, and been re&s;tored to the bo&s;om of his family, who mo&s;t proba|bly were continually lamenting his lo&s;s. "No," &s;aid the unfortunate Frenchman to him&s;elf, <Q>I will not give way to the &s;olicitations of An|tonio; I will not repay &s;o generous a friend|&s;hip by being the cau&s;e of his death. He will be free. My unhappy father will at lea&s;t learn that I am alive, and that my affec|tion for him is unabated. Alas! I could wi&s;h to be the &s;upport and con&s;olation of his age. He wanted my a&s;&s;i&s;tance&mdash;perhaps he is now peri&s;hing in poverty, and wi&s;hing to &s;ee and embrace his &s;on. However, if Antonio is happy, I &s;hall die with le&s;s re|gret.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;laves were not taken from their pri&s;on the next morning at the u&s;ual hour. The Spaniard was all impatience, while Robert was in doubt whether he &s;hould rejoice or grieve at the di&s;appointment. At length they were call|ed to their labour, but they could not &s;peak to each other, for their ma&s;ter went with them. Antonio could only look at Robert and &s;igh. Sometimes he ca&s;t his eyes towards the &s;ea, and
<PB N="311" REF="030190_0316_0FE508D4E2F93388">
could hardly &s;uppre&s;s his emotions. At length night arrives, and they find them&s;elves alone. "Let us &s;eize this opportunity," cries the Spa|niard, "Come!" "No," replies the other: my friend I never will con&s;ent to endanger your life: farewel, Antonio! I embrace you for the la&s;t time. Save your&s;elf, I conjure you; you have no time to lo&s;e. Remember our friend&s;hip. I only reque&s;t you to remember your promi&s;e in regard to my father. He mu&s;t be very old, and much in di&s;tre&s;s; go and con&s;ole him. If he &s;hould want a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I am &s;ure my friend"&mdash;At the&s;e words the voice of Robert failed&mdash;he &s;hed a torrent of tears&mdash;his bo&s;om was torn with angui&s;h. "You weep, Robert," &s;ays Antonio; "it is not tears, but courage, that we now want: re&s;i&s;t no longer; a moment's delay may ruin us; we may never have the opportunity again; either deliver your&s;elf to my direction, or I will da&s;h my head again&s;t tho&s;e rocks."</P>
<P>The Frenchman threw him&s;elf at the feet of the generous Spaniard: he &s;till repre&s;ented the hazard of the attempt, and pointed out the in|evitable danger that mu&s;t attend his re&s;olution of endeavouring to pre&s;erve him. Antonio made no reply, but catching him in his arms, he ran to the edge of the precipice, and plung|ed with him into the &s;ea. At fir&s;t they both &s;unk; but, ri&s;ing to the &s;urface, Antonio ex|erted all his force, and &s;wimming him&s;elf, kept Robert al&s;o above the water, who &s;eemed to re|fu&s;e his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and to fear le&s;t he &s;hould in|volve him in his own de&s;truction.</P>
<P>The people in the &s;hip were &s;truck with an

object which they could not well di&s;tingui&s;h. They thought it was &s;ome &s;ea-mon&s;ter that ap|proached the ve&s;&s;el. Their curio&s;ity was now called another way; they &s;aw a boat leave the &s;hore and ha&s;tily pur&s;ue what &s;eemed to them a mon&s;trous &s;ea-animal. The&s;e were the &s;oldi|ers who guarded the &s;laves, and who were anxious to overtake Antonio and Robert. The la&s;t &s;aw them approach, and, ca&s;ting his eyes on his friend, and perceiving that he grew weak, he made an effort and got loo&s;e from An|tonio,
<PB N="313" REF="030190_0318_0FE508D81CD5DDD0">
&s;aying to him at the &s;ame time. "We are pur&s;ued. Save your&s;elf, and let me pe|ri&s;h; I only retard your cour&s;e." He had hardly fini&s;hed the&s;e words when he &s;unk. A new tran&s;port of friend&s;hip animates the Spani|ard; he darts towards the Frenchman, and &s;eizing him as he is ju&s;t ready to expire, they both di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>The boat, uncertain which way to pur&s;ue, &s;topped; while another was &s;ent from the ve&s;&s;el to di&s;cover what the object was which they had &s;een. The waves began to grow rough; at la&s;t they di&s;covered two men, the one &s;up|porting the other, and trying to reach the ve&s;|&s;el. They rowed to them as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, and came up with them ju&s;t as Antonio's &s;trength began to fail. They took them both on board. Antonio cried out feebly, <Q>A&s;&s;i&s;t my friend&mdash;I die;</Q>&mdash;and his countenance &s;eemed convul&s;ed with the agonies of death. Robert, who was in a &s;woon, recovering at the in&s;tant, and &s;eeing Antonio without any &s;ign of life extended by his &s;ide, was almo&s;t di&s;|tracted; he threw him&s;elf on the body of his friend. "Antonio!" he cried, "my dear Antonio, my friend, my deliverer, have I been your murderer? Alas! you cannot hear me. Is this your recompen&s;e for having &s;aved my life? But what is life? Who can &s;upport it af|ter the lo&s;s of &s;uch a friend?"</P>
<P>Saying this, he &s;tarted up in the boat, and, &s;eizing a &s;word, would have plunged it into his bo&s;om, if he had not been di&s;armed; but in the mid&s;t of his lamentations and di&s;traction, Providence, apparently to reward an affection
<PB N="314" REF="030190_0319_0FE508DB5B7F2F40">
&s;o &s;incere, interpo&s;ed in his favour&mdash;Antonio breathed a &s;igh. Robert flew to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his friend, who, lifting up his languid eyes, tried to find the Frenchman, and, as &s;oon as he perceived him, cried out with a tran&s;port be|yond his &s;trength, "I have &s;aved my friend!"</P>
<P>They were both conveyed on board the ve&s;|&s;el. Their exemplary friend&s;hip diffu&s;ed a re&s;pect for them among the whole crew. And, &s;uch is the effect of virtue even on the rough|e&s;t minds, every one contended with his fel|lows in &s;howing them attention. Robert ar|riving in France flew to his father, who was ready to die with exce&s;s of joy at &s;eeing him, and was appointed to a genteel office under the Government. But the Spaniard, who was likewi&s;e offered a very advantageous po&s;t, for one in his &s;ituation of life, cho&s;e rather to re|turn to his wife and family. But ab&s;ence did not dimini&s;h his friend&s;hip; he continued &s;till to corre&s;pond with Robert, and their letters, which are ma&s;ter-pieces of &s;implicity and affec|tion, do honour to the &s;entiment which was capable of producing &s;o heroic an action.</P>

<HEAD>THE DUEL; OR THE MAN OF TRUE COURAGE.</HEAD>
<P>MELCOUR lo&s;t his parents at an age when he could not be &s;en&s;ible of the greatne&s;s of his mis|fortune. One of his uncles took him home, brought him up with his own &s;on, and paid the
<PB N="315" REF="030190_0320_0FE508E20B3ED090">
utmo&s;t attention to his education. Florival and Melcour, already united by the ties of kin|dred, were &s;oon more &s;o by tho&s;e of friend&s;hip, which, from their living con&s;tantly together, grew &s;tronger every day. They were both de|&s;igned for the army. When they were of a proper age, they got commi&s;&s;ions in the &s;ame regiment. Florival always hated application, and the di&s;&s;ipation that naturally attends a mi|litary life &s;till inclined him le&s;s to it. As for Melcour, he had not only a very good natural genius, but a &s;trong inclination to cultivate it. His &s;tudies had been properly directed; and a generous and humane di&s;po&s;ition, joined with a habit of thinking &s;eriou&s;ly, led him to condemn the criminal practice of fighting duels on tri|vial occa&s;ions, a cu&s;tom too prevalent in the army.</P>
<P>Different pur&s;uits le&s;&s;ened, by degrees, the friend&s;hip of the two young men. Florival was blinded by the love of plea&s;ure, he ran in|to all &s;orts of extravagance, and became in|volved in debt. Melcour lamented his folly, a&s;&s;i&s;ted him with his pur&s;e, and endeavoured to &s;ave him from the ruin into which he was going to plunge. He repre&s;ented to him how much his conduct degraded him in the eyes of &s;en&s;ible people. "Even tho&s;e," &s;aid he to him, "who now applaud your extravagance, will be the fir&s;t to upbraid you when they &s;ee you in di&s;|tre&s;s. They call them&s;elves your be&s;t friends, and you believe them; they have e&s;tranged you from me. They have painted me to you in the mo&s;t unfavourable colours, and if they have not entirely extingui&s;hed the friend&s;hip
<PB N="316" REF="030190_0321_0FE508E5A487CE80">
that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between us, at lea&s;t they have greatly weakened it. The wretches well knew my &s;incere affection for you; they are informed of the pains I have taken to di&s;cover to you their perfidious de&s;igns, and they wi&s;h to pu|ni&s;h me for them. O, my friend, if they &s;hould &s;ucceed in robbing me of your e&s;teem, their triumph will be too complete! But, my dear Florival! I do not &s;peak on my own account only. I conjure you, by every &s;entiment of virtue that united our infancy, not to plunge a dagger in the heart of the be&s;t of fathers. If he were to know the exce&s;&s;es you run into he would die with &s;orrow."</P>
<P>The&s;e remon&s;trances touched the heart of Florival. He promi&s;ed to amend; but his perfidious friends repre&s;ented vice to him in &s;o amiable a form, that he was unable to re&s;i&s;t. Melcour being informed, that, after having lo&s;t a great &s;um of money at play, he was gone to di&s;&s;ipate his &s;orrow by infamous debauchery, immediately went to him, and urged to him, with &s;ome vehemence, the duties of his &s;itua|tion, and the promi&s;es he had made to fulfil them.</P>
<P>Florival was no longer ma&s;ter of him&s;elf; he fell into a mo&s;t violent rage again&s;t his cou|&s;in; he even drew his &s;word on him; and on Melcour's refu&s;ing to &s;ight him, he abu&s;ed him in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t terms, and was almo&s;t tempted to &s;trike him. His cou&s;in &s;till kept his tem|per: unworthy as Florival appeared of his af|fection, he yet only regarded him as a friend and relation.</P>
<P>Overcome by this &s;teadine&s;s, he at length
<PB N="317" REF="030190_0322_0FE508E72FEFAAE0">
recovered his temper. He was a&s;hamed of his behaviour, and begged pardon of Melcour for his violence, which was immediately granted by the generous youth, and an immediate and perfect reconciliation took place.</P>
<P>An officer belonging to another regiment happened to be pre&s;ent during the affair; he had been witne&s;s to the provocation given by Florival, and he imputed the coolne&s;s of his cou&s;in to want of courage. He did not fail to make many &s;arca&s;tic remarks on it, and they came at length to the ears of &s;ome of Melcour's friends. The lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion is deemed injuri|ous to the honour of a &s;oldier. After many inquiries, it was di&s;covered who&s;e conduct had given ri&s;e to the &s;candal. They were told the honour of the corps was wounded through them, and it was their duty to vindicate it. The means were evident. If the report was true, they mu&s;t fight each other; if fal&s;e, they mu&s;t puni&s;h the author of it. Melcour was truly mi&s;erable. His principles di&s;approved of duelling in any in&s;tance; and in this, if he obeyed the injunctions of his corps, he was re|duced to the terrible nece&s;&s;ity of plunging his &s;word into the bo&s;om of his relation and friend. But, in vain did he repre&s;ent his feelings to his brother officers, they would hear of nothing but the choice of weapons, time, and place. His &s;orrow was unutterable: he retired to his apartment. Florival, who went to look for him, found him leaning on a table, hiding his face with his hands, his eyes &s;treaming with tears, and his continual &s;ighs only interrupted by the frequent repetition of the name of Flori|val.
<PB N="318" REF="030190_0323_0FE508EA6E41D7B8">
At &s;uch a &s;ight he was not able to con|tain him&s;elf; he threw him&s;elf at the feet of his friend. His appearance recalled to Melcour all the horror of his &s;ituation&mdash;"What! in a moment I am called upon to pierce your heart, and do you come to &s;eek me?&mdash;O Florival!" &s;aid he, his voice almo&s;t choaked with tears, "&s;hould my arm deprive you of life, I would not &s;urvive you. What &s;hould I &s;ay to your fa|ther? did he take &s;o much care of my infancy, to &s;ee me &s;tained with the blood of his &s;on? O, wretched old man, whatever may be the event of this horrid duel, it will be an eternal &s;ource of angui&s;h for you!"</P>
<P>At this in&s;tant &s;ome of the officers forced open the door; they came to tell Melcour he could not delay the combat any longer without giving room to call his courage in que&s;tion. What a terrible &s;ituation! At this in&s;tant the two friends were embracing each other&mdash;they were unable to return any an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Florival was the fir&s;t who broke this mourn|ful &s;ilence. In him the mi&s;taken principles of honour at pre&s;ent prevailed over tho&s;e of friend|&s;hip. He got up, and extended his arm to a&s;|&s;i&s;t Melcour, without daring to look at him. He aro&s;e and walked about the room in the greate&s;t agitation; he fancied he &s;aw his rela|tion and friend murdered by his hands, and his di&s;tracted uncle demanding vengeance for the blood of his &s;on. At length, recovering him&s;elf, he turned to the officers, and &s;aid to to them in a firm and re&s;olute tone of voice: I will no longer he&s;itate to act the part which is pointed out to me by the voice of religion, of
<PB N="319" REF="030190_0324_0FE508F42A6E2EC0">
rea&s;on, and of humanity, be the con&s;equence what it may. My determination is fixed. Go, and inform tho&s;e who &s;ent you, that Melcour prefers an <HI>imaginary</HI> di&s;honour to a <HI>real</HI> crime, and that no con&s;ideration upon earth &s;hall tempt him to point his &s;word again&s;t the bo&s;om of his friend. This an&s;wer determined his fate. His brother officers informed him with the &s;incere&s;t regret, that, as he had refu&s;ed to fight, it was impo&s;&s;ible for them to roll with him, and that he mu&s;t quit the regiment. Who can de&s;cribe the feelings of Florival, when he heard this &s;entence? it was <HI>be</HI> who had brought Melcour into this terrible &s;ituation. The di&s;grace of his cou&s;in was owing to <HI>his</HI> follies. The&s;e thoughts almo&s;t drove him to di&s;traction. His friends were alarmed for the con&s;equences, and removed him by force from the mournful &s;cene.</P>
<P>Melcour, left to him&s;elf, &s;oon determined what &s;teps to take. He was determined not to return home, to be there expo&s;ed to a di&s;grace he was con&s;cious of not de&s;erving. He re&s;olv|ed to endeavour to improve the talents which Nature had endowed him with by travelling, till time &s;hould either obliterate the memory of this unfortunate adventure, or &s;how it in its true light. That very evening he made the proper preparations for his journey, and wrote a letter to his cou&s;in, acquainting him with his intended expedition. "Inform my uncle," he added, "of all that has happened; let him know that they wanted to compel me to be|come your murderer. He will &s;hudder at the thought. Though the&s;e barbarians, guided
<PB N="320" REF="030190_0325_0FE508F5C873CD98">
only by a fal&s;e &s;en&s;e of honour, think me un|worthy to &s;erve my king and country, he at lea&s;t will applaud the courageous efforts I have made to pre&s;erve us both from a crime. This le&s;&s;on, my dear Florival, will be of ad|vantage to you; your eyes are now opened to the conduct of your companions. Still conti|nue your regard for me; and never e&s;teem me unhappy while I pre&s;erve a place in your friend|&s;hip."</P>
<P>He &s;et out at day-break the next morning, accompanied by a &s;ingle &s;ervant. He had not gone many miles from the garri&s;on when he &s;aw a large detachment of the enemy on the point of defeating an inferior number of French troops. He could not behold his countrymen in danger of being vanqui&s;hed without burning with ardour to a&s;&s;i&s;t them. Regardle&s;s of the danger of the attempt, he only li&s;tened to the call of glory; and this Melcour, who&s;e cou|rage his brother officers had pre&s;umed to que&s;|tion, flew to the field of battle, performed pro|digies of valour, took one of the enemy's co|lours, and animating his countrymen by his example, they obtained the victory.</P>
<P>The general officer who commanded the de|tachment was charmed with the bravery of the young warrior, and earne&s;tly de&s;ired to know his name. "Sir," he replied, "I will tell you who I am directly; but, will you give me leave fir&s;t to a&s;k, what is the immediate de&s;ti|nation of your detachment?" "It is going," &s;aid he, "to reinforce the neighbouring garri|&s;on," (naming that which Melcour had left.) "of which I am to take the command," <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">,
<PB N="321" REF="030190_0326_0FE508F750D6F578">
Sir," &s;aid Melcour, "if you will permit me, I will attend you thither, and receive there tho&s;e marks of your approbation that you &s;hall be plea&s;ed to honour me with."</P>
<P>They arrived. "Sir," &s;aid Melcour, "the only favour I a&s;k of you, is to call together the officers of the regiment of ***" (that which he had quitted); they a&s;&s;embled, and Melcour appeared. "Behold, gentlemen," &s;aid he, "the unfortunate victim of a fal&s;e ho|nour, to which you &s;acrifice every thing, though it often renders you cruel and unju&s;t. Becau&s;e I refu&s;ed to &s;tain my hands with the blood of a relation younger than my&s;elf, and who had ex|piated a very &s;light offence by the mo&s;t unequi|vocal marks of &s;orrow and repentance; becau&s;e I li&s;tened to the voice of religion and humanity; becau&s;e I re&s;pected the laws, you have judged me unworthy to carry arms in the &s;ervice of my country. Blinded by prejudice, you have dared to accu&s;e me of cowardice. For that accu&s;ation I have taken ample revenge. The&s;e colours, taken from the enemy, are a &s;uffici|ent te&s;timony of my courage." His brother officers &s;urrounded him, and embracing him, by the prai&s;es they lavi&s;hed on him, and the ex|cu&s;es they made, they atoned for the ra&s;h &s;u&s;pi|cions they had entertained of him.</P>
<P>The general, a&s;toni&s;hed and charmed with the behaviour of Melcour, pre&s;&s;ed him to re|&s;ume his rank for the pre&s;ent, till he could have an opportunity of reporting &s;o gallant an action to the mini&s;ter. Melcour yielded to his &s;olici|tations, &s;econded by tho&s;e of the officers of the regiment. "Accept," &s;aid the general, "that
<PB N="322" REF="030190_0327_0FE508FA5EC574E8">
commi&s;&s;ion you was deprived of ye&s;terday, as a tacit avowal of the inju&s;tice of that prejudice which condemned you, and may your example entirely root it out!" Then turning to the of|ficers who &s;urrounded him, he added: "Let the behaviour of this virtuous young man teach you, for the future, not to accu&s;e that per&s;on of cowardice, who, obedient to the laws of true honour, and of his country, refu&s;es to become a murderer. Renounce, gentlemen, that fatal error, which &s;hows you the man of true courage in him who is not afraid to wa&s;h out an injury in the blood of his fellow citizen: behold him rather in the per&s;on who has greatne&s;s of &s;oul to be above the de&s;ire of revenge. For the fu|ture, defer your quarrels till the day of battle, and let the conte&s;ts for &s;uperior re&s;olution be decided in the face of the enemies of your king and country. Or, if the in&s;ult offered you is amenable to the laws, let the laws fix that ignominy on your adver&s;ary that his conduct may de&s;erve. But, let your warme&s;t prai&s;es be be&s;towed on Melcour, and on tho&s;e who have the magnanimity to follow the example he has this day given us."</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the tran&s;ports of Florival during this affecting &s;cene. From that moment he renounced his fatal errors, and, &s;trictly keeping the &s;olemn promi&s;es he had made to his friend, and profiting by his exam|ple, they both were rai&s;ed to the highe&s;t &s;tati|ons in the army, which they filled with the greate&s;t honour to them&s;elves, their family, and their country.</P>

&s;ometimes, if they happened to di&s;plea&s;e her, &s;he would &s;cratch and beat them in the mo&s;t violent manner. Notwith&s;tanding her finery, and her &s;uperfluity of toys, notwith&s;tanding &s;he had every thing at her command which riches could procure, and every one was &s;triving to make her happy, &s;he was a mo&s;t mi&s;erable lit|tle girl. Her tyrannical temper made her univer&s;ally di&s;liked, even by tho&s;e who were obliged to be &s;ub&s;ervient to her, and her fret|fulne&s;s and ill humour was a con&s;tant thorn in her own bo&s;om.</P>
<P>At the entrance of her father's park &s;tood a lodge, which was inhabited by a poor man who had al&s;o one daughter. Little Jenny was one of the be&s;t tempered girls in the world; &s;he was never &s;een crying and out of humour like Emmeline, but on the contrary, was civil and obliging to every body. There was not a &s;er|vant at the hall but loved her as if &s;he had been their own child; and never did they go down to the lodge, but they were &s;ure to carry her an apple, or a piece of plum-cake, or &s;ome|thing, nice in their pockets. It frequently hap|pened that Jenny was &s;ent for to play with Em|meline, which &s;he did not like at all, for the young lady was &s;o whim&s;ical it was impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e her, and frequently would de&s;ire Jenny to do what was very improper. On &s;uch oc|ca&s;ions the would never comply; for though &s;he paid the haughty little girl every re&s;pect which was due to her rank, &s;he never forgot what was due to her&s;elf: well knowing that a wrong ac|tion is equally culpable, whether he per&s;on who tempts us to commit it, be poor or rich.
<PB N="325" REF="030190_0330_0FE50905FAE1EDC8">
If in their play they happened to break any thing, Emmeline would de&s;ire Jenny to &s;ay it was one of the &s;ervants who did it; and when &s;he refu&s;ed to be guilty of &s;o wicked an action, Emmeline would put her&s;elf in a violent pa&s;&s;ion, and frequently beat her. In &s;hort it is not to be conceived how di&s;agreeable &s;he made her|&s;elf. She was al&s;o very ignorant; &s;he could neither read, nor write; for though &s;he had &s;everal ma&s;ters, not one of them attended her more than three or four le&s;&s;ons. Mrs. Gordon would not permit her to be reprimanded, and no one could long endure her unre&s;trained in&s;o|lence. She was therefore unacquainted with the mo&s;t common branches of learning, and when Jenny, who was nearly the &s;ame age, could read very well, Emmeline &s;carcely knew her letters. Jenny was one day as u&s;ual &s;ent for to the hall, and when &s;he arrived &s;he found the young lady in the parlour with her Papa and Mama, who were endeavouring to divert her by a great variety of very pretty prints, which they had &s;ent for from London. She looked at them a little time, and then being tired, to&s;&s;ed them away. Jenny took one to look at, when Emmeline &s;natching it from her, a&s;ked her how &s;he dared touch it? <Q>I beg your pardon, Mi&s;s Emmeline, &s;aid &s;he but I was only going to look at it.</Q></P>

She im|mediately began to cry and &s;hriek &s;o loud, that in a few minutes her Papa, Mama, and half the &s;ervants came running to &s;ee what was the matter. Mrs. Gordon chided the &s;ervant very much for the accident, though &s;he well knew it was in no &s;ervant's power to prevent her daugh|ter's doing what &s;he liked. Mr. Gordon took her in his arms, and carried her into the hou&s;e; but it was &s;ome hours before &s;he could be paci|fied. Such was the child, whom unbounded indulgence had totally &s;poiled, for Emmeline had not naturally bad di&s;po&s;itions. With in|crea&s;ing years, her faults increa&s;ed al&s;o, and her parents then began to &s;ee, and lament the folly of their conduct. Every plea&s;ure, every comfort of their lives were totally de&s;troyed. They could not enjoy their own home from the wretched temper of their daughter, nor were they happier when abroad, as their fears for her &s;afety were ever awake. They knew no one
<PB N="327" REF="030190_0332_0FE50910ABF743A8">
could controul her, and that however dangerous what &s;he had a fancy for, that, &s;he would do. They were invited to &s;pend a month at a gen|tleman's &s;eat at &s;ome miles di&s;tance. Not with|out great reluctance did they accept the invita|tion; but at length it was determined Jenny &s;hould &s;tay with Emmeline during their ab|&s;ence. Poor Jenny dreaded the per&s;ecution &s;he knew &s;he mu&s;t endure, and when &s;he put on her bonnet to go to the hall, &s;he could not help crying. The fir&s;t day of her vi&s;it was &s;pent much as u&s;ual; but the &s;econd, Emmeline was if po&s;&s;ible, more ill tempered than ever; and Jenny, tired beyond all endurance, thus ad|dre&s;&s;ed her: <Q>Mi&s;s Emmeline, I am come here, not becau&s;e I wi&s;h it, but becau&s;e your Mama, has de&s;ired it; do not therefore think that I will be treated in this manner. I know that I am poor, and you are rich; but yet, Mi&s;s Emmeline I would not change &s;ituations with you. Of what u&s;e to you is your rank, but to enable you to torment others, and to make every one as unhappy as your&s;elf? I do not believe the poore&s;t beggar &s;uffers more than you do. You have riches, but you do not know how to enjoy them, and though you call your&s;elf great, nobody loves you.</Q></P>
<P>This was language Emmeline had never be|fore heard; &s;he would have uttered the effu&s;i|ons of her pa&s;&s;ion, but &s;hame kept her &s;ilent. She felt a &s;en&s;ation &s;he had never experienced; and inferiority wholly new. How much did this little pea&s;ant appear &s;uperior to her&s;elf? how was all her boa&s;ted con&s;equence dwindled to nothing?</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="030190_0333_0FE509141CB1E2E0">
Such is the power of Virtue, that even the wicked are awed by it. From that time Emme|line felt a veneration for Jenny &s;he knew not how to account for. She &s;aw how happy &s;he always appeared, how much &s;he was beloved, and in &s;hort, how different &s;he was in every re|&s;pect to her&s;elf. The&s;e reflexions fir&s;t con|vinced her of her folly, in imagining &s;he could ever be happy if &s;he was not good. She re|&s;olved to imitate the conduct &s;he could not but admire, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to become amiable. But &s;he found this a very hard ta&s;k; &s;he had not only virtues to acquire, but faults to con|quer which <Q>had grown with her growth, and &s;trengthened with her &s;trength.</Q> But yet, though it was difficult, it was not impo&s;&s;ible; &s;he told her re&s;olution to Jenny, who could &s;carcely contain the raptures &s;he felt at hearing this declaration; and &s;he thought Emmeline had never appeared &s;o lovely as in that moment. Her countenance was no longer clouded by frowns and tears; &s;he began to feel what hap|pine&s;s virtue can be&s;tow, and that it is &s;he alone who makes us truly great.</P>
<P>Very often did &s;he relap&s;e into her former habits, but reflexion, by pointing out their fol|ly, and experience, by &s;howing their mi&s;ery, fortified her mind to re&s;i&s;t their attacks; Jen|ny too was near, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted her to conquer them. Hitherto the profu&s;ion of money, which the too great indulgence of her parents had al|lowed her, had been &s;pent in cakes, &s;ugar|plums, and toys; but now, a new &s;ource of de|light was opened to her; &s;he ta&s;ted the charms of benevolence, and her bo&s;om was warmed by
<PB N="329" REF="030190_0334_0FE50915AA2D64D0">
the emanations of charity. The poor of the village &s;aw in her a ri&s;ing benefactre&s;s, and the widow and the orphan prayed for her happine&s;s. The &s;ervants too, whom &s;he now treated in a very different manner, re&s;pected her as much as they had before de&s;pi&s;ed her; and every one was eager to wait upon, and oblige her. As for Jenny, by who&s;e example and advice the little tyrant had been reclaimed (for it was &s;he who had taught her to pray Heaven to a&s;&s;i&s;t her good intentions) it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay with what warmth of affection &s;he loved her. Her &s;tay at the hall was no longer di&s;agreeable to her, no longer occa&s;ioned dread and unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. Gordon had been per&s;uaded by their friends to extend their vi&s;it a month longer. So uncomfortable was their own home, that they agreed to it with much le&s;s reluctance than they would otherwi&s;e have done. Two months, therefore, they had been ab&s;ent, when they began to prepare for their return. The plea&s;ure they would have felt in &s;eeing Emme|line after this long ab&s;ence, was much damped by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s how ill &s;he de&s;erved their affection: yet them&s;elves only had they to blame; for her heart was good, and naturally inclined to virtue; but <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> de&s;tructive are the con&s;equences of unre&s;trained indulgence, that human nature is vitiated by it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t glance Emmeline caught of the car|riage among the trees, her heart began to beat with unu&s;ual &s;en&s;ations. She felt the painful emotions of con&s;cious &s;hame; &s;he knew how ill &s;he had requited the tenderne&s;s of her parents, and after a &s;truggle with &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="330" REF="030190_0335_0FE50918D137BAE8">
&s;parks of pride, &s;he determined to confe&s;s her faults, and entreat her parents' forgivene&s;s. As &s;oon as they entered the hou&s;e, &s;he expre&s;&s;|ed in a manner very different from her former habits, the joy &s;he felt at &s;eeing them. They cla&s;ped her to their bo&s;oms, and looked at each other in &s;ilent a&s;toni&s;hment. They now began to di&s;play the profu&s;ion of toys, which they had brought her home, and a&s;ked her how &s;he liked them? She made no an&s;wer, but bur&s;ting into an agony of tears, threw her&s;elf on her knees before them, and declared her conduct had hi|therto made her unworthy their goodne&s;s, but &s;he would in future endeavour to de&s;erve it more.</P>
<P>Inexpre&s;&s;ible were the raptures of Mr. and Mrs. Gordon, they could not find words to de|clare their feelings, but each endeavoured to exceed the other in the mo&s;t affectionate ca|re&s;&s;es. She now con&s;tituted their happine&s;s as truly as &s;he had before been the cau&s;e of their &s;orrow. Her bad habits had been too long in|dulged to yield to any thing but time and re|&s;olution; yet her relap&s;es were &s;hort, and the contrition &s;he felt, was her be&s;t &s;ecurity again&s;t their return. When her parents were informed it was to Jenny they were in a great mea&s;ure in|debted for their daughter's reformation, they determined their gratitude &s;hould equal her virtue.</P>
<P>Emmeline had very &s;oon a worthy woman provided as a governe&s;s for her, to whom &s;he was docile, obedient, and attentive; and made &s;o rapid a progre&s;s in her &s;tudies, that &s;he a&s;to|ni&s;hed all who had known her former ignorance.
<PB N="331" REF="030190_0336_0FE50922B0A08838">
Jenny was kept at the hall, and &s;hared in the plea&s;ure and in&s;tructions of her friend, to whom &s;he every day became dearer.</P>
<P>From this &s;tory, my little readers may learn the benign influence of Virtue. Vain are rich|es, vain the boa&s;t of power without it! They can never rai&s;e any one &s;o high as Virtue.</P>
<P>Let them con&s;ider Emmeline and Jenny. How much was the latter, though cloathed in the &s;imple&s;t manner, &s;uperior to her haughty friend, even when decked in the mo&s;t co&s;tly at|tire! Let none then de&s;pi&s;e Poverty, it is often found the re&s;idence of Virtue. Let them pay to merit what is always its due, though found in the humble&s;t walks of life. And let every one remember there is no real &s;uperiority but that of Goodne&s;s; and that it is equally the part of Wi&s;dom and Virtue, to efface the wild ine|quality, the di&s;tinctions paid alone to rank and riches, which pride and folly have introduced into the world.</P>
