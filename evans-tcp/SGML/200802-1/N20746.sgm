<OPENER><SALUTE>Re&s;pectable friends and Brethren,</SALUTE>
INVITED by you to &s;peak on this occa&s;ion, permit me to call your greateful contemplations to dwell a few moments on the maje&s;ty and goodne&s;s of the &s;upreme Lord and Architect of the univer&s;e. The pious admiration, expre&s;&s;ed by that wi&s;e and ancient monarch Solomon, the builder of the Temple, at the great|ne&s;s and conde&s;cention of Jehovah, will be the theme of my di&s;cour&s;e.</OPENER>

<BIBL>I KINGS, viii. 27.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>But will God indeed dwell on the earth! Be|hold the heaven, and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee: how much le&s;s this hou&s;e which I have builded?</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS is a &s;entence of that devout and &s;o|lemn prayer, which Solomon addre&s;&s;ed to the God of I&s;rael, at the dedication of that magnificent edifice the Temple. It was the will of God, that a hou&s;e of prayer &s;hould be erected in Jeru&s;alem, and that Solomon, the wi&s;e&s;t and
<PB N="6" REF="027244_0005_0FD3CCED773F5750">
wealthie&s;t monarch of the ea&s;t, &s;hould build it, and that it &s;hould exceed in &s;plendor, any thing that the world had &s;een.</P>
<P>"Solomon built him a hou&s;e. Howbeit the Mo&s;t High dwelleth not in temples made with hands, as &s;aith the prophet, <HI>Heaven is my throne, and earth my foot&s;tool."</HI> God is not confined to place or bounds. The hou&s;e was intended for the wor&s;hippers of Jehovah, in which to meet and pre&s;ent their religious homage. The mag|nificence of the building, which was one of the wonders of the world, was de&s;igned by the pious builders to bear a faint re&s;emblance of the glory of the Being wor&s;hipped there.</P>
<P>The model of the hou&s;e was given from hea|ven, and I&s;raelites and Tyrians were the work|men. Hiram, king of Tyre, &s;ent his &s;kilful arch|itects from Tyere and Sidon, to work with the builders of I&s;rael. The materials were prepared beforehand. The cedars were fa&s;hioned on Leb|anon, and the &s;tones and marble hewed and pol|i&s;hed at the quarries. They were brought to|gether, and the building aro&s;e without the noi&s;e of axes or hammers. Lively emblem of the church of the redeemed, made up of Jews and Gentiles; a glorious building re&s;ting on the foundation of the apo&s;tles and prophets, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the chief corner &s;tone. They are here prepared by the grace of the Redeemer, the &s;anctification of ordinances and of afflictions, and the operation of the divine Spirit, fa&s;hioning them in the &s;trength and beauty of holine&s;s, for that temple in the Lord, in the peaceful world above, where no jarring noi&s;e is heard. And lively
<PB N="7" REF="027244_0006_0FD3EA59D408F7A0">
image al&s;o of the church on earth, when the peaceful and benevolent &s;pirit of the religion of Je&s;us, &s;hall univer&s;ally reign.</P>
<P>At the completion of this noble edifice, king Solomon, at the head of the congregation of I&s;|rael, addre&s;&s;ed God in a mo&s;t &s;olemn prayer, em|ploring his favorable pre&s;ence, and be&s;eeching him to ble&s;s his wor&s;hippers there. And God was plea&s;ed to give them a pledge of his gracious acceptance, by a glorious light &s;hining in the temple, between the golden cherubims, and by a dazzling cloud inveloping the edifice. No pious &s;ouls &s;incerely &s;eek the favour of God in vain. How great was the joy and holy wonder of the king and the people, at this manife&s;tation of the divine favor? Solomon could &s;carcely realize the conde&s;cention; that the high and holy Being who inhabits eternity, &s;hould thus favorably regard the prayer of his people, and by this token of his gracious pre&s;ence, dwell with men. <HI>But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold the heaven, and the heaven of heavens, cannot contain thee! how much le&s;s this hou&s;e which I have builded?</HI></P>
<P>Two thoughts e&s;pecially, &s;trike the mind, on reading this &s;ublime pa&s;&s;age, this pious exclama|tion of the royal preacher,&mdash;the <HI>maje&s;ty of God,</HI> and <HI>his kindne&s;s to men.</HI> I will humbly attempt to rai&s;e my own and your devout contemplations to the&s;e great &s;ubjects&mdash;<HI>the maje&s;ty and immen&s;ity of Jehovah,</HI> the builder of the univer&s;e, and cre|ator of the ends of the earth, and <HI>his wonderful goodne&s;s and conde&s;cention</HI> to the wants and affairs of men; and to make &s;uch application of the
<PB N="8" REF="027244_0007_0FD3CCEFB2A70698">
&s;ubject, as may corre&s;pond to the purpo&s;es of our pre&s;ent a&s;&s;embling.</P>
<P>Every pious mind is &s;truck with admiration at the immen&s;ity of God. For there can be no part of the univer&s;e or infinite &s;pace, but God is pre&s;ent there.</P>
<P>Our thoughts are capable of forming only ve|ry &s;canty conceptions of the immen&s;ity or om|nipre&s;ence of God. On entering on this great &s;ubject, I feel my in&s;ufficiency and nothingne&s;s; but to pur&s;ue it as far as we are able, will exalt God in our thoughts and &s;erve to give us &s;uitable apprehen&s;ions of our&s;elves. For who by &s;earch|ing can find out the maje&s;ty of God, or his in|finite immen&s;ity to perfection? Our exi&s;tence and knowledge are limited, and beyond certain bounds we cannot extend. And all creatures with whom we are acquainted, are al&s;o finite and limited; and in our conceptions of the univer&s;e, we are ready to imagine that there mu&s;t be &s;ome end to the creation, or to extended &s;pace. And al&s;o in our thoughts on the exi&s;tence of God, we are inclined to limit his pre&s;ence, and to con|ceive that it is local and circum&s;cribed. We are unable to gra&s;p immen&s;ity and infinitude. Our capacity of thought is finite and bounded, and we are therefore lo&s;t and drowned in the di|vine immen&s;ity. Such is the imperfection and &s;cantine&s;s of our knowledge.</P>
<P>So far as our eyes can &s;ee over the earth, and up to the &s;tary heavens, we behold the wonder|ful effects of the Creator's &s;kill, his power and goodne&s;s. The &s;tars appear &s;mall by rea&s;on of
<PB N="9" REF="027244_0008_0FD3EA4F61606730">
their immen&s;e di&s;tance. It would be many ages before the &s;wifte&s;t eagle could reach the neare&s;t of them. This earth on which we dwell is great, but how &s;mall a &s;pot is it compared to the whole creation? Numerous &s;tars are &s;een by the eye, and by the help of gla&s;&s;es are &s;een, &s;tars greatly beyond them; and each, probably a &s;un to inhabited worlds of rational creatures, revolving around them.</P>
<P>Should the &s;oul di&s;engaged from the body, fly with &s;wiftne&s;s to tho&s;e di&s;tant worlds of light, it would no doubt, there &s;ee other &s;y&s;tems and worlds of light on all &s;ides, appearing as &s;tars in the va&s;t fields of the univer&s;e. Should it ex|tend its journey for millions of ages, through interminable &s;pace, it would &s;ee, with increa&s;ing wonder, works on works of the creator. Or &s;hould it reach the end of the works of Crea|tion, if any end there be, to created &s;y&s;tems and worlds, would find it&s;elf within the univer&s;e of God, &s;u&s;tained and upheld by his omnipre|&s;ence. Beyond the utmo&s;t bounds of creation, there &s;till remains an unbounded infinite &s;pace, the work of the Almighty. In attempting to reach the limit or the end, the thoughts are lo&s;t, weary and confounded. Such is this immen&s;e univer&s;e, and infinite extended &s;pace. And God is pre&s;ent in all parts and places therein. His e&s;&s;ential pre&s;ence is here and there, and beyond the utmo&s;t extent to which our thoughts can reach. He is, &s;ays one, as a circle, whole cen|ter is every where, and his circumference no where. Whither, O Lord, &s;hall I go from thy pre&s;ence? If I a&s;cend up into heaven, thou art there; if I make my bed in hell, lo, thou art
<PB N="10" REF="027244_0009_0FD3EA6B1545FFC8">
there: if I take the wings of the morning, and fly with the &s;wiftne&s;s of the rays of light to the utmo&s;t bounds of the creation, even there will thy hand &s;u&s;tain me, and thy immen&s;ity &s;urround me.</P>
<P>This amazing univer&s;e, the temple and re&s;i|dence of the Deity, was brought into exi&s;tance by an act of his almighty will. "<HI>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."</HI> He &s;pake and it was done. Man can fa&s;hion &s;ome curious work when he has materials and tools to work with. But who except a Deity, can call from nothing into being? Who but God could &s;tretch out the heavens as an immen&s;e cur|tain, adorned with countle&s;s worlds of light, and give them their admirable beauty and order!</P>
<LG>
<L>Fond athei&s;t, could a giddy dance,</L>
<L>Of atoms lawle&s;s hurl'd,</L>
<L>Produce &s;o regular, &s;o fair,</L>
<L>So harmoniz'd a world!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A God! a God! Creation &s;houts,</L>
<L>A God! each in&s;ect cries;</L>
<L>He moulded in his palm the earth,</L>
<L>And hung it in the &s;kies.</L>
</LG>
<P>From the works of creation, we infer the im|men&s;ity and omnipre&s;ence of God. As unbounded &s;pace and the created univer&s;e have God for their author, his e&s;&s;ence mu&s;t be nece&s;&s;arily infinite and unbounded. If there were any place, where God is not, it would imply imperfection, becau&s;e his exi&s;tance would then be limited and his in|finitude abridged.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="027244_0010_0FD3EA6C74A26550">
It is al&s;o inferred from the providence of God, and his con&s;ervation of all things. Without his pre&s;ence in all parts of the univer&s;e, &s;u&s;tain|ing, upholding and governing all, all things would ru&s;h to ruin, and to their primitive no|thingne&s;s. All things are full of God. O won|derous knowledge! The immen&s;ity of Jehovah is high, we cannot attain unto it. "Thy great|ne&s;s, O Lord is un&s;earchable. Great and mar|vellous are thy works, Lord God almighty, &s;ought out by all them, who have plea&s;ure in them."</P>
<P>The maje&s;ty and immen&s;ity of God are per|fections which fill our minds with awful reve|rence and &s;olemn fear. It is his goodne&s;s, his kindne&s;s and conde&s;cention to men which ren|der all his perfections amiable, and which en|courage us to approach this high and holy being, our glorious Maker, with humble confidence and filial love.</P>
<P>His conde&s;cention to the wants and the affairs of men, impre&s;&s;ed the mind of the king and con|gregation of I&s;rael with holy wonder, admiration and joy. Let the goodne&s;s and conde&s;cention of our God to us, &s;irs, his needy and offending creatures, now and all times deeply affect our minds, and irre&s;i&s;tably and &s;weetly impel us, to love and &s;erve him for ever. "Ble&s;s the Lord, O my &s;oul, and never forget his benefits, for his mercy endureth forever." An ocean of benevo|lence exi&s;ts in God. The &s;treams flow over all creation. His infinite and amiable goodne&s;s appears in the creation of the univer&s;e. It is &s;een on earth&punc; in all the favourable circum&s;tan|ces,
<PB N="12" REF="027244_0011_0FD3EA4FBAE64710">
in which creatures are placed to obtain the happine&s;s of which they are capable. "The eyes of all, O Lord, wait upon thee, and thou &s;atisfie&s;t the de&s;ires of every living thing." What a va&s;t family of living creatures, be&s;ides man, wait on God, and are fed and clothed from the &s;tore-hou&s;e of his bounty?</P>
<P>Thus God's infinite kindne&s;s appears in the creation of beings to po&s;&s;e&s;s happine&s;s, and al&s;o in their con&s;tant pre&s;ervation. "In God we live and move and have our being." His pre|&s;ence pervades our e&s;&s;ence and by his con&s;tant care, the &s;pirits are pre&s;erved before him, and the &s;ouls which he has made.</P>
<P>To every nation and individual, he leaves not him&s;elf without a witne&s;s of his goodne&s;s, in &s;ending rain from heaven, and fruitful &s;ea&s;ons, and all the bounties of his providence, filling their hearts with food and gladne&s;s.</P>
<P>And tho' men mi&s;u&s;e and abu&s;e the bounties of heaven, and &s;purn at the hand that is liberally extended to give, yet the goodne&s;s and the mer|cy of God follow them, all the days of their mor|tal life. Time would fail, &s;hould we dwell on the delightful theme of the goodne&s;s and the love of God to men, and the one half would remain untold.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only remind you brethren, of that cap|ital gift of God to men, the gift of his Son to re|deem us. This is &s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion of love in the Deity, as fills holy angels with admiration
<PB N="13" REF="027244_0012_0FD3EA6CF7352DC0">
and joy. In this was manife&s;ted the love of God, that he &s;ent his Son into the world to re|deem us. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that God loved us. Hear, O heavens, and be a&s;toni&s;hed, O earth, with joyful &s;urpri&s;e, at this wonderful and divine conde&s;cention; and let the glory be given to the highe&s;t, that thro' the ble&s;&s;ed Mediator, there is peace on earth, and good will to men.</P>
<P>The &s;ame divine philanthropy is &s;een in the Son of God, by whom the father made all worlds, and who as to his divine nature is one with him, and whom neither heaven, nor the heaven of heavens can contain. Yet, wondrous conde&s;cen|tion! Behold him coming to dwell on earth,&mdash;veiling his glories in mortality,&mdash;conver&s;ing with us as a man conver&s;es with his friend,&mdash;guiding us by his example, his precepts and his &s;pirit, through the duties and dangers of life, and point|ing us to the man&s;ions of eternal life, glory and felicity in heaven.</P>
<P>Having now taken a &s;ummary though very imperfect view, of the immen&s;ity of Jehovah, and his kindne&s;s and conde&s;cen&s;ion to men, we will conclude with a few REFLECTIONS.</P>
<P N="1">1. Great, &s;irs, is the duty and un&s;peakable the advantages of having our minds habitually im|pre&s;&s;ed, with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of a pre&s;ent God. The eyes of the Lord are in every place, behold|ing the evil and the good. He is the con&s;tant witne&s;s and will be the righteous judge of all thoughts and actions, and before his &s;upreme tri|bunal
<PB N="14" REF="027244_0013_0FD3EA6471A5E660">
our &s;pirits mu&s;t appear, to receive an eter|nal retribution.</P>
<P>We are wholly dependant on God for our be|ing, and for all the favorable circum&s;tances of our &s;tate of trial for eternity; and for all that good and happine&s;s which our immortal &s;pirits hope for throughout the endle&s;s periods of our exi&s;t|ance. To whom then &s;hould we &s;eek principal|ly to approve our&s;elves, but to him, in who&s;e fa|vor is our immortal life?</P>
<P N="2">2. We hence infer the nece&s;&s;ity of our recon|ciliation with God; and that we &s;ecure in this our &s;tate of trial for eternity, an intere&s;t in his love and favor. His di&s;plea&s;ure is more dreadful than the terrors of death, and his &s;miles diffu&s;e im|mortal joy. Here we are &s;urrounded with ob|jects of &s;en&s;e, and &s;ee God only in his works; but when our di&s;embodied &s;pirits &s;hall be u&s;her|ed into the world of &s;pirits, our thoughts will then be filled with the immen&s;ity of God. There we &s;hall &s;ee him, face to face. All other objects will be in a manner lo&s;t to us, and God be all in all. What will then be the condition of the &s;oul that finds it&s;elf alone with God? How dreadful the terrors of his di&s;plea&s;ure who&s;e frowns can make a hell of mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Let the &s;olemn con&s;ideration powerfully re&s;|train from all &s;in, and impel us to all duty. Let us cultivate an habitual &s;en&s;e of the pre&s;ence of God with us every where. It will be the &s;afe&s;t and happie&s;t means of guarding us from evil&mdash;of re&s;training the &s;allies of intemperate pa&s;&s;ions&mdash;of mortifying our love of forbidden plea&s;ures,
<PB N="15" REF="027244_0014_0FD3EA64779A92C8">
and crucifying every lu&s;t. It will &s;weetly per|&s;uade to the cultivation of a meek, holy, and heavenly temper and conver&s;ation; to be holy as God is holy, and merciful as our Father in heaven is merciful.</P>
<P N="3">3. He is mo&s;t &s;afe and happy who loves and plea&s;es God. There can be no true love to God without an habitual de&s;ire to plea&s;e him in all things. And to what higher ble&s;&s;edne&s;s can the &s;oul a&s;pire, than the friend&s;hip of the immen&s;e and eternal Jehovah, the greate&s;t and be&s;t of be|ings. Secure of this the &s;oul is &s;afe in every po&s;|&s;ible condition. It is the only cordial and &s;up|port in the mo&s;t adver&s;e and trying &s;cenes of life. When the wicked are driven away in judgment as chaff before the de&s;troying tempe&s;t, God remembers the righteous and comforts them in the mid&s;t of trouble. His favor makes &s;weet amends for the lo&s;s of all things. "Although the fig-tree &s;hall not blo&s;&s;om, neither &s;hall fruit be in the vines, the labor of the olive &s;hall fail, and the fields &s;hall yield no meat, the flocks &s;hall be cut off from the fold, and there &s;hall be no herein in the &s;talls, yet, I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my &s;alvation." And when they pa&s;s through the valley of the &s;had|ows of death they fear no evil, for God is with them.</P>
<P>The friend&s;hip of God, is the only &s;ource of immortal life and joy, through all eternal ages. This con&s;titutes the happine&s;s of angels and pi|ous departed &s;pirits. To them God is all in all. They are ab&s;orbed in the immen&s;ity of his love.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="16" REF="027244_0015_0FD3EA7AE6723190">
4. Let pious &s;ouls look up to God, and tru&s;t in his almighty goodne&s;s. For to them, he gives the tokens of his &s;pecial favor. He meets them in the ways of his in&s;titution. He an&s;wered the pious prayer of Solomon and the congregation, at the temple, in divine conde&s;cention and kind|ne&s;s. He honors the hou&s;e of prayer, and meets the faithful with cele&s;tial ble&s;&s;ings. Happy are all his faithful &s;ervants who wor&s;hip him in his earthly temple! In due time they will be admit|ted to the heaven of heavens, the &s;anctuary on high, where they will need not the light of the fun, to enlighten them, "for the glory of the Lord doth enlighten it and the Lamb is the light thereof."</P>
<P N="5">5. From the divine example illu&s;trated by the &s;ubject, we infer, that conde&s;cention, kindne&s;s and brotherly love, towards our fellow men, are duties which as men and chri&s;tians, we ought dai|ly to put in practice. Is Jehovah, whom the heaven of heavens cannot contain, good and kind to men? Let men be glad to imitate the great example. "If God hath thus loved us, then ought we to love one another." Cultivate and cheri&s;h, &s;irs, the benevolent and friendly affec|tions. Let the love of God, and of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t reign in your heart, and ye cannot fail to love your neighbour as your&s;elf. And actuated by this genuine principle of chri&s;tian benevolence, you will pre&s;ent an offering accept|able to God and u&s;eful to men. For God is love, and this is his commandment that ye love one another, as brethren of one family and travellers to the immortal inheritence.</P>

<HI>Gentlemen of this ancient and honourable Society,</HI></P>
<P>UNDER the impre&s;&s;ion of the &s;ublime and glorious truths, of which &s;ome faint &s;ketches have now been offered, permit me to addre&s;s to you a few thoughts.</P>
<P>As the mo&s;t excellent creature on earth, it has plea&s;ed our merciful Creator, to make man capable of the communications, the profits and plea&s;ures of &s;ociety. There is in man the princi|ples of ju&s;tice, truth and benevolence; and a &s;en&s;e of accountablene&s;s to God, as the powerful motive to every moral and &s;ocial virtue. In him are found the humane and friendly affections, the faculty of rea&s;on and &s;peech, and &s;kill in numberle&s;s u&s;eful inventions and arts.</P>
<P>Without &s;ociety the&s;e faculties and acqui&s;itions would be u&s;ele&s;s and man mo&s;t unhappy. You have entered into a &s;ociety where the obligations are &s;pecial. Every laudable &s;ociety is formed to promote the good of its members and the public happine&s;s. In the e&s;timation of mankind a &s;ociety is honorable in proportion to this tendency. May you, gentlemen, ever act up to the charitable and beneficent de&s;ign of your in&s;titution. Ever re|member that there can be no true greatne&s;s of character without goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>The real antiquity of your &s;ociety, is great. It was honoured in the ages of Chivalry. Kings princes and prie&s;ts have enroled their names among the fraternity. It is much to the credit of your in&s;titution, that your laws exclude from your &s;ocial retreats all oppo&s;ing debates on the politics of government, and on different &s;y&s;tems
<PB N="18" REF="027244_0017_0FD3EA7647E06738">
of religion; and that it opens its friendly bo&s;om, to receive as brethren, the worthy of all nations, languages and denominations. Your &s;ociety is di&s;per&s;ed over Europe and America and extends into A&s;ia. Multitudes of the fraternity, whom mi&s;fortunes had reduced, have been comforted, fed and clothed by its charity.

<P>In captivity and di&s;tre&s;s in foreign climes, your laws encourage you to expect relief from the charity of Ma&s;ons; and demand of you the &s;ame return; and to forget the enemy in the brother. The&s;e things are good and profit|able to men.</P>
<P>Illu&s;trious characters in civil and military de|partments in modern times, are al&s;o found in your fraternities. May you dignify your &s;ociety by a laudable and worthy example in all re&s;pects, and in all duty to God, to mankind and to one another. Permit me to call to your grateful re|collection, that kind providence of God, which allows you, with undi&s;turbed quietne&s;s, to pur|&s;ue your labours in the&s;e peaceful regions, while the nations of Europe are convul&s;ed with dreadful wars. <HI>Deus hec otia fecit.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">God gives us this repo&s;e.</NOTE></P>

Let us thank, love and obey our God, the God of our fathers, for his di&s;tingui&s;hed favors. And may his redeemed people of the&s;e &s;tates, ce|lebrate his goodne&s;s forever!</P>
<P>The badges of your order, are very &s;ignificant and happily de&s;igned. Imitate, brethren, the <HI>Sun,</HI> one of the bright emblems of your order, in the diffu&s;ion of goodne&s;s and u&s;eful knowledge all around you. He &s;hines upon the evil and the good, and &s;catters joy and gladne&s;s wherever his light and warmth come. Ob&s;erve the &s;hin|ing <HI>&s;tars,</HI> their regular revolutions and &s;teadi|ne&s;s in their orbits. Be like them con&s;tant and per&s;evering in all u&s;eful labours.</P>
<P>May this new &s;ociety, be as the bright <HI>morn|ing-&s;tar,</HI> ari&s;ing in this we&s;tern hemi&s;phere, re&s;|plendant in goodne&s;s!</P>
<P>Take the <HI>compa&s;s</HI> of propriety of behaviour, and the <HI>&s;quare</HI> of rectitude in all your conver&s;a|tion, the <HI>plum-line</HI> and <HI>level</HI> of un&s;haken ju&s;tice, the <HI>&s;word</HI> of fortitude in duty, and the <HI>trowel</HI> of diligence in bu&s;ine&s;s, and daub not with untem|pered morter; but be ambitious to excel in eve|ly noble and u&s;eful labor. Let all your life be uniform in virtue and goodne&s;s, and like a fini&s;h|ed and well proportioned edifice.</P>
<P>Bear the <HI>hod</HI> of patience in the nece&s;&s;ary la|bors and &s;ufferings of life, and a&s;cend the <HI>ladder</HI> of honorable promotion, and may you be worthy of a feat in <HI>Solomon's chair.</HI> Solomon, whom we celebrate for wi&s;dom, and whom you claim as the ancient patron of your order.

white and fair <HI>aprons,</HI> be the true emblems of your innocency and purity of character, and fi|delity in all bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Like the <HI>hive</HI> of indu&s;trious <HI>bees,</HI> may you ga|ther &s;tores of knowledge and virtue from the wide fields of nature and revelation, and the fruits of your labours benefit others as well as your&s;elves. And in all the &s;ocial intercour&s;e of life may the naked <HI>heart</HI> be truly de&s;criptive of your &s;incerity and brotherly love.

<P>The&s;e emblematic figures, re&s;pected friends, calling you to virtue, and the wi&s;e and diligent improvement of life, as a &s;tate of preparation for eternity, receive additional force from the <HI>&s;hroud</HI> and the <HI>coffin,</HI> which terminate all earthly &s;cenes, and remind you of the &s;hortne&s;s of your abode on earth. May your remembrance live as the <HI>&s;prig</HI> of <HI>evergreen,</HI> when the gra&s;s growing over your grave, &s;hall wave to the whi&s;pering winds.

<P>While you meet for the purpo&s;es of your in&s;ti|tution, &s;uffer the preacher to remind you of the fading nature of earthly friend&s;hips and all &s;ublu|nary joys.</P>

Architect of the univer&s;e and Judge of all, mu&s;t you appear, to give account of all your labors of life; when every &s;ecret thing will be brought into judgment, and the actors receive the recompence of reward either of approbation or condemnation. And with you, &s;irs, will be a&s;&s;embled the whole brotherhood of mankind the children of Adam. For that &s;olemn and au+gu&s;t a&s;&s;embly, let it be your daily &s;olicitude to prepare.</P>
<P>And as you profe&s;s your&s;elves, <HI>&s;peculative</HI> Ma|&s;ons, may you indeed be <HI>operative</HI> and practical chri&s;tians, and be found of your judge in peace.

May you meet with acceptance, with all the faithful and the cho&s;en, Amen.</P>
<P>I will conclude, in a word addre&s;&s;ed to this whole a&s;&s;embly. My fellow mortals, we are here in the morning of our exi&s;tance and begin|ing our character and labors, for eternity. Of what importance is it, that we begin well? And that our hearts and lives, and all our ways be ap|proved by that high and holy and immen&s;e Being, under who&s;e con&s;tant in&s;pection we are, and to whom we mu&s;t go. Scenes of infinite moment, await us, when the curtain of time &s;hall drop, and unbounded eternity open upon our a&s;toni&s;h|ed minds. "Set your affections on things above, and not on things on the earth.</P>

and this great world it&s;elf," will pa&s;s away as a vi&s;ion of the night. Let us prepare for that kingdom that &s;hall never be moved; looking for and ha&s;tening to the coming of the day of God, that through redeeming grace, we may be re|ceived into tho&s;e man&s;ions of light and holine&s;s on high, which the ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer prepares for his loving and obedient di&s;ciples.</P>
<P>Now unto him that is able to build us up into an holy temple in the Lord, and to give us an in|heritence among all them that are &s;anctified, be a&s;cribed &s;alvation, dominion and glory, through|out all ages.</P>
