<P>_NEXT to life is liberty, and when oppre&s;&s;ion and tyranny are violent they cau&s;e the parties oppre&s;&s;ed to make &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance, let them be ever &s;o feeble. The government and au|thority of kings are almo&s;t as old as the crea|tion, and if we look back to antiquity, we will find the good old patriarch Abraham engaged in a war with five kings, which he defeated, retook his brother and all his &s;poil, and at his return from the &s;laughter, had the approbation and be|nediction of Melchizedeck the prie&s;t of the mo&s;t high God, who congratulated him on his victory, and regaled him with bread and wine. The force that Abraham had was but &s;mall, yet with that force he overcame all his enemies.&mdash;So may America and her allies overcome all their enemies. But before we proceed, let us take notice why tho&s;e words were &s;poken by the children of I&s;rael to Rehoboam their rightful &s;overeign, and then apply the ca&s;e to America and Great-Britain, with &s;ome remarks.</P>
<P>Di&s;obedience is the general cau&s;e of all earthly calamities, and &s;ometimes meets with immediate vengeance from the hand of the

Lord and from the hand of man. Solomon's di&s;obedience was the cau&s;e of the ten tribes revolting, as you will find it record|ed in the preceding chapter; which points out the revolution of the ten tribes, as it came to pa&s;s in the fir&s;t year of the reign of Solomon's &s;ucce&s;&s;or.&mdash;Thus you &s;ee the children vi&s;ited with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ins of the fathers.&mdash;Rehoboam being the hereditary prince repairs to Shechem to be placed on his father's throne, and accordingly all the heads of I&s;rael a&s;&s;emble to the coronation: But the children of I&s;rael were appri&s;ed of Rehoboam's de&s;igns, and they &s;ent and fetched Jeroboam the u&s;urper, for he had fled through fear from the land, during the reign of king Solomon; for had he remain|ed there he m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t undoubtedly have lo&s;t his life.

<P>But who will an&s;wer for the blood that has been &s;pilt in America when the Lord maketh enquiry for it, I know not.&mdash;But I am afraid I have deviated from the point in view.&mdash;</P>
<P>So when all I&s;rael &s;aw that the king would not hear nor redre&s;s their grievances, they all with unanimous voices &s;aid, What portion have we in David, or what inheritance in the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n of Je&s;&s;e, to your tents, O I&s;rael! and thou David &s;ee to thine own hou&s;e.&mdash;Thus the grand &s;eparation takes place between the unfortunate &s;on of king Solomon, and the whole kingdom of I&s;rael. The people are now re&s;olute, &s;ince the laws cannot be repealed nor the burdens removed, they would be no longer &s;ubjects.&mdash;Thus it was with the Americans and Britain&mdash;When the laws of the land are &s;ubverted the &s;ubjects are di&s;contented and ready for a revolt.</P>
<P>King Rehoboam is now confined to the &s;mall government of the tribe of Judah only. How mortifying, yet how ju&s;t, was his pu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">hment! In this terrible dilemma he &s;ent Adoram who was his tribute officer to conciliate and pacify a revolted and an enraged people; but how vain and u&s;ele&s;s was this me&s;&s;enger. The en|raged I&s;raelites took this as a new in&s;ult and they all &s;toned him with &s;tones that he died! What will not men do that have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">wle&s;sly in&s;ulted and aggrieved? The execution of this principal officer alarmed the &s;on of Solomon, that he hurried and made all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed to get him up to his chariot that he might flee to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eru&s;alem. Thus you &s;ee how fear accompanies guilt even in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ings, and when they do ami&s;s they ought to be puni&s;hed as well as the meane&s;t &s;ubject; and when they reign well it is the duty of every &s;ubject to acknowledge them as their &s;overeign.

How pride and ambition gilded with avarice can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lind the eyes and minds of the be&s;t of men.</P>
<P>Rehoboam could not reli&s;h the revolution of his &s;ubjects, it mortified his pride to that degree that he was mad with rage.

<P>If you do not retaliate, the cries of his fatherle&s;s and motherle&s;s children will reach the ears of heaven, and it will be again&s;t you, and the gho&s;t of their decea&s;ed parents will &s;tare you in the face in the day of battle and cau&s;e you to flee before your ene|mies. Let me for once u&s;e the language of Semphronius, when he &s;aid, "Ri&s;e and revenge your &s;laughtered citizens or &s;hare their fate." If you are &s;till timid and afraid of them, your allies will withdraw their armies and navies from among you, and leave you to be a prey unto your enemies, who&s;e tender mercies are cruelties. You have now no portion in them, therefore be not afraid of them, but fight for your liberty, your peace and your independence, your &s;ons and your daughters, your wives and your hou&s;es, and remem|ber the Lord who is great and terrible. Ye Americans, ye Geor|gians, ye virtuous Carolinians, ye who have experienced the vio|lation of Briti&s;h faith, and been the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">f objects of mini&s;terial vengeance, unto you I addre&s;s my&s;elf; ye who have been eye-witne&s;&s;es
<PB N="11" REF="017717_0010_0FA2655662AB1770" MS="y">
of the mo&s;t &s;olemn engagements &s;candalou&s;ly broken, it behoves you to &s;eek for vengeance, and join your fellow-citizens, that are now hazarding their lives in the high places in the field.&mdash; Ye bani&s;hed exiles, that have been driven from every dome&s;tic happine&s;s to &s;uffer in Ea&s;t Florida, and there to be circum&s;cribed to certain limits, to &s;uffer the in&s;ults of Briti&s;h authority; now you are relea&s;ed, be vigorous in your exertions, and be in&s;trumental in &s;topping the wounds of your bleeding country.</P>
<P>But where am I going! I &s;hall enter into an inextricable labyrinth! Pardon me, I cannot conclude before I addre&s;s my&s;elf to the virtu|ous daughters of Carolina, who&s;e courage, per&s;everance and forti|tude are equal to the daughters of ancient Rome and Sparta. After being deprived of the companions of their lives, and in&s;ulted by the enemies of America, they &s;till maintained their ground, and have followed their exiled partners acro&s;s the mighty deep.&mdash;O ye virtuous daughters, many daughters have done well, but ye ex|cel them all.</P>
<P>Fear not ye brave &s;ons of Columbia, though &s;ome of your bre|thren the citizens of America have by treachery de&s;erted you and your cau&s;e for avaricious purpo&s;es, they with their accomplices will never be able to hinder the republican American e&s;tabli&s;hment. I hope the day is not far off, when America &s;hall cau&s;e Britain to know, that virtue has well rewarded her virtuous &s;ons; when her inde|pendency &s;hall be acknowledged by all the powers of Europe, whether armed or neutral, and even Britain her&s;elf mu&s;t acknowledge the approaching event. &mdash; What &s;ucce&s;s through heaven has our arms been crowned with towards the &s;outhwa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d! What military atchievements has been performed by our gene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">als, and what &s;uc|ce&s;s has the navy of our ally met with here of late on the &s;outhern coa&s;ts!</P>
<P>Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord of ho&s;ts, the God of battles, for all the glorious things done for America &mdash;</P>
<P>May all the enemies of America peri&s;h or be conquered, but all tho&s;e that are anxious for her liberty and independence be as the &s;un when he goeth forth in his might, and may we be a free people for ever!</P>
<P>Which may God grant, through our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to whom be glory forever and ever! AMEN.</P>
