<P>THIS &s;hort but pithy &s;entence, contains in it all the virtues of the divine and the &s;ocial life. If we might be &s;o happy as to penetrate to the bottom of it, to reach the quinte&s;&s;ence, to unfold the &s;ubject matter of it, <HI>Charity,</HI> in its nature and ri&s;e, its genuine tendency, effects, objects and operati|ons, we &s;hould &s;ee that it will dilate and expand it&s;elf &s;o as to reach every order of men, not only

in their general callings as chri&s;tians, but in their particular callings, connexions and relati|ons to each other as members of community. For as the truth contained in it, is not too low for the greate&s;t monarch on earth, &s;o neither is it too high for the meane&s;t pea&s;ant to be con|ver&s;ant with. And were the hearts of men generally opened to give entertainment to it, they would in&s;tantly become <HI>the epi&s;tle of Chri&s;t,</HI> and pre&s;ently <HI>be known and read of all men.</HI> And the law of charity being <HI>written not with ink, but by the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of &s;tone, but in the fle&s;hly tables of</HI> their <HI>hearts</HI>; of a cur&s;ed and mi&s;erable, this would &s;oon become a ble&s;&s;ed and happy world!&mdash;It was a quality radically concreted with the hu|man nature; but by the &s;eduction and apo&s;tacy was lo&s;t.</P>
<P>As the creation &s;prung from the Creator, <HI>all was good</HI>: And as man came forth of the hands of his MAKER; (<HI>man,</HI> the beauty and glory of the lower creation) he was innocent and up|right: In the moral image of his glorious author, &mdash;all was love&mdash;all was harmony. But when pride entered &s;ome of the cele&s;tial inha|bitants, and proved the defection of tho&s;e prime apo&s;tates, the devil and his angels, envy and malignity wrought for the &s;eduction of man made in the image of God; and proved fatally &s;ucce&s;&s;ful. Man was lo&s;t! his heart was turned off from its proper center and objective ble&s;&s;ed|ne&s;s.
<PB N="7" REF="012430_0004_0F8997D6537A7B10">
That &s;en&s;e of moral excellence, (the light of the knowledge of the glory of God,) in which radically lay his &s;piritual life, was gone. Pride, malignity, di&s;cord and enmity took place. His &s;un was &s;et! darkne&s;s and the &s;hadow of death over&s;pread him. His appetites, which were made and de&s;igned to be &s;ubordinate, gained the a&s;cendent. Man fell under the cur&s;e: and in&s;tead of an innocent regard to that felicity which aro&s;e from the heart's being &s;wallowed up primarily in love to the glorious Being, and a &s;en&s;e of moral beauty, a &s;upreme regard to &s;elf, and to creature good, took place. Hence all that jarring, di&s;cord, confu&s;ion and blood&s;hed which en&s;u'd, all over this mi&s;erable world; as well as all tho&s;e pains, di&s;orders, and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of human nature; which finally reduce us to the du&s;t, whence we were taken. The cur&s;e of God's law fell upon us, which condemns to eternal pain for every tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and di&s;obedience. And the very ground is cur&s;ed for man's &s;ake, in con&s;equence of his &s;in. Yea, the animate and inanimate world &s;u&s;tains the weight. The creature or the creation groans, being burdened and pained for deliverance. And from this guilty depravity, in which lies our &s;piritual death, and has &s;o uni|ver&s;ally &s;pread it&s;elf through the human nature, ari&s;es all that unkindne&s;s from friends, and all that bitterne&s;s from enemies, which we &s;ee and feel in this apo&s;tate world. In a word, man|kind

<P>UPON this plan proceedeth the wonderful work of redemption and recovery for lo&s;t man, by the Redeemer and Sanctifier: by the Son of God who came to &s;eek and to &s;ave that which is lo&s;t, and by the Spirit of God to make application. Here was room for mercy, mere mercy to take place;&mdash; divine wi&s;dom and coun&s;el found out the way, for the exerci&s;e of it. A way glorious, clear beyond the reach and penetration of the mo&s;t exalted of created nature, till it was opened to view by the man who&s;e <HI>name is the Brouch; who was to build the temple of the Lord; to build the Temple of the Lord, and to bear the glory.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Zech. 6.12.</NOTE>
Of which early di&s;coveries began to be made &s;oon after the apo&s;tacy; and were after renewed and made more plain to Abraham, Mo&s;es, David and I&s;aiah, who &s;aw his glory and &s;pake of him. And when the fullne&s;s of time was come that the predictions which went before of him &s;hould be accompli&s;hed; &s;uch as <HI>this</HI> with many others; <HI>Behold a virgin &s;hall conceive and bear a Son, and &s;hall call his name Emanuel; the Spirit of the Lord came upon her, and the power of the highe&s;t over &s;hadow'd her.

thing born of her is call'd the Son of God.</HI> In a time of general expectation he made his entrance into the world, in a way not agreeable to the general ta&s;te; not with public ob&s;ervation; not in worldly &s;plendor, as the princes and nobles of this world&mdash;but in humble ob&s;curi|ty, he made a &s;table his birth-place, and a man|ger his cradle. However, it was to the ob&s;er|vation of the upper world, attended with a pomp and magnificence truly caele&s;tial; becom|ing the dignity of the Per&s;on. The heavenly inhabitants were active and admiring &s;pectators of the &s;urpri&s;ing &s;cene. The morning &s;tars &s;ang together, &amp;c.

God; to the cordial practice of the duty and felicity pointed out in our text, <HI>CHARITY.</HI></P>
<P>WHICH word contains in it the &s;ub&s;tance of the law and religion of innocence, and the reli|gion of the go&s;pel. CHARITY is an agreeable found to mo&s;t, and often in the mouths of men in general; but too often a &s;tranger to their hearts: and perhaps little under&s;tood in the genuine nature and effects of it.</P>
<P>IN di&s;cour&s;ing on the words, let us</P>
<P N="1">I. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a little to the nature, the ri&s;e, objects and operations of it.</P>
<P N="2">II. VIEW it as the end of the commandment.</P>
<P N="3">III. MAKE &s;ome application, agreeable to the &s;ubject and occa&s;ion.</P>
<P N="1">I. WE are to attend a little to the nature, ri&s;e, objects and operations of charity.</P>
<P>IF we con&s;ult the &s;acred oracles, we &s;hall find it a primary and radical virtue of the chri&s;tian life: clear above, and &s;pecifically different from any thing we are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of in this fallen &s;tate, either by natural birth, or the force and influence of meer education. <HI>That which is born of the fle&s;h is fle&s;h,</HI> agreeable to its own principle depraved. <HI>To be carnally minded</HI> there|fore <HI>is enmity again&s;t God.</HI> The loyal &s;ubjects

of God's moral government, as &s;uch, <HI>are born not of blood, nor of the will of the fle&s;h, nor of the wiil of man.</HI> And as to the glories of that king and kingdom, with which charity is pri|marily conver&s;ant, they are revealed not by fle&s;h and blood.</P>
<P>CHARITY in its nature is the &s;ame with love, a divine or a true chri&s;tian love: which is a holy exerci&s;e of heart toward its proper objects; and is the root and &s;ub&s;tance of all godline&s;s. That it is the &s;ame in its nature with holy love, may be &s;een by ob&s;erving that the &s;ame word, <HI>agape,</HI> in the original language of the new te&s;tament, here tran&s;lated <HI>charity,</HI> is every where u&s;ed, where the word <HI>love</HI> is u&s;ed in our tran&s;lation, i. e. a holy or chri&s;tian love. To mention but one in&s;tance out of innumerable; <Q>Hope maketh not a&s;hamed, becau&s;e the love of God</Q> <HI>agape tou theou,</HI> <Q>is &s;hed a|broad in the heart.</Q> And where it has not only the &s;upreme and glorious Being, but fel|low-creatures as the object of it, as in our text, and el&s;ewhere, it &s;eems to be judiciou&s;ly tran&s;lated <HI>charity</HI>: And comprehends the &s;ub|&s;tance of both tables.</P>
<P>IT IS of a divine original, the fruit of a graci|ous efficacy. For <HI>the fruits of the Spirit are love,</HI> &amp;c. It ari&s;es <HI>out of a pure heart</HI>: a heart purified or renew'd by grace; put into a di&s;po|&s;ition to &s;ee and feel the weight of the arguments and motives to love; which never fail to operate

where they are properly apprehended: as they always are when the <HI>&s;eed falls into good ground</HI>; or truth enters an <HI>hone&s;t and good heart&mdash;and of a good con&s;cience</HI>: a con&s;cience regulated ac|cording to truth; called &s;ome times a <HI>pure con|&s;cience.</HI> When the mind and con&s;cience is defiled, every thing is out of order. <HI>Unto them who are defied and unbelieving, is nothing pure; but even their mind and con&s;cience is defiled.</HI><NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Tit. 1. 15.</NOTE> Con&s;cience may be called the eye of tie &s;oul; a di&s;cerner of the things which are excellent, and of the excellence of then&mdash;and of the guilt and turpitude of the rever&s;e.

<P>THE apo&s;tle adds&mdash;<HI>and of &s;aith unfeigned</HI>: a found and permanent faith; by way of di&s;|tinction from that which is temporary and tran|&s;ient, <HI>withering away in time of temptation</HI>&mdash;and from that which is in pretence, and not in

truth; or that which is erroneous and un&s;ound. Which was the ca&s;e with &s;ome in the church at <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> which began to degenerate in Paul's day; who be&s;ought Timothy to <HI>charge &s;ome</HI> not to teach any <HI>other doctrine</HI>; <HI>mee heterodida&s;ca|lein,</HI> not to teach heterodoxy; which &s;ome had fallen into, incon&s;i&s;tent with that <HI>form of &s;ound words delivered</HI> to them: and had turned a&s;ide to vain jangling; <HI>de&s;iring to be teachers of the law, not under&s;tanding what they &s;aid, nor where|of they affirmed.</HI> And before the decea&s;e of the apo&s;tle John, that church was complained of as having <HI>lo&s;t her fir&s;t love.</HI> When a church or people degenerate, or fall into errors incon|&s;i&s;tent with the truth and &s;implicity of the go&s;|pel, they lo&s;e their love or purity toward God, and their charity toward men. He who comes to God, mu&s;t believe his being and perfections, or his true character; which is mo&s;t e&s;pecially exhibited in the truths revealed in his holy law, and in the glorious go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. When tho&s;e truths are received, and that cha|racter duly apprehended in the excellence of it, (as it always is when the truth enters an hone&s;t and good heart), <HI>charity</HI> or a holy affection un|variably en&s;ues, and is coming to God. For it is a uniting of the heart to the glorious and worthy object.</P>
<P>HE therefore, who receives the record of God, on <HI>divine</HI> te&s;timony, or <HI>believeth</HI> in his heart, <HI>that Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t, is born of God</HI>;
<PB N="14" REF="012430_0008_0F8997D935C38CC0">
and will not <HI>be a&s;hamed of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, for it is the power of God to</HI> every one <HI>who be|lieves,</HI> and gives entertainment to <HI>the truth as it is in Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>As to the objects of charity, that noble, that divine and exten&s;ive virtue, it is not bounded by the utmo&s;t limits of creation. It extends clear beyond all created nature. As it is virtuous, noble and &s;ublime in its nature, &s;o it &s;oars alo&s;t to the mo&s;t noble and &s;ublime objects; the unbounded and incomprehen&s;ible excellence of the Creator and Redeemer. As it is &s;aid of <HI>hope,</HI> &s;o may it be &s;aid of <HI>charity,</HI> out of which hope &s;prings: it enters into that within the vail, whither the fore-runner is for us entered. If our affection is bounded by the creature, or limited to created good, we have no portion in God, nor at pre&s;ent capable of enjoying any. Charity, if it take a &s;urvey of all creatures and things below the &s;kies, and then &s;tretch its wings and ari&s;e to the upper and invi&s;ible world, rove among created caecle&s;tial inhabitants, the general a&s;&s;embly and church of the fir&s;t|born, and the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect, can find nothing in them, which can be its ut|mo&s;t bounds, or its principal and primary ob|ject. It cannot be bounded by, or re&s;t in any thing &s;hort of uncreated excellence, the &s;um and comprehen&s;ion of being and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, the perfections and glories of God and the Lamb who &s;etteth on the throne.

<P>THE greate&s;t and be&s;t of beings, the <HI>Being</HI> of glorious and unbounded excellence, is the pri|mary object of this holy affection.

<P>CHARITY always has re&s;pect to &s;ome being or quality as its object; and the apprehended amiablene&s;s or worth of the object, (which is likewi&s;e its ground and motive) the higher, it ri&s;es, the &s;tronger it operates, and the greater the felicity re&s;ulting from it. It may be que&s;|tioned, whether it is po&s;&s;ible in the nature of things, for a rational or &s;ocial creature as &s;uch (which is the &s;ame with a moral agent) to enjoy happine&s;s ab&s;tract from all con&s;ideration of re|lation to &s;ociety? If not, whether the happi|ne&s;s of a rational creature, as &s;uch, is not wholly of the &s;ocial kind? And if &s;o, it may be a&s;&s;erted that there can be no happine&s;&s; to a moral agent without love; and even all that happine&s;s ra|dically con&s;i&s;ts in it. Thi&s; rea&s;oning &s;eems to

This therefore is the &s;um of the law, to love the Lord thy God with all the heart; and thy neighbour as thy &s;elf: Therein we have fellowship one with another; and truly our fellow&s;hip is with the Father and with his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t.

<P>REMARK I.

<P>FROM all which we may remark,</P>
<P N="2">II. THE va&s;t difference between this, and that modern charity which &s;eems to be in the mouths of many, but is well con&s;i&s;tent with an impure, an unrenewed heart, an evil con&s;cience and a feigned faith. [The <HI>one</HI> is the root and comprehen&s;ion of all virtue public and private, and the other has nothing of the nature of true and genuine virtue in it. The <HI>one</HI> is a &s;uper|natural and divine principle, and the <HI>other</HI> flows from principles merely human and depraved. And as their origin, &s;o their objects and ten|dency are &s;pecifically different. The <HI>one</HI> (a di&s;intere&s;ted virtue) has him who is glorious in holine&s;s for its primary and its ultimate object; while mere &s;elf is the ri&s;e, the hinge and the centre of the <HI>other.</HI>]</P>
<P>IT &s;eems to lie &s;ome times in liberal bene|factions to the public and the poor: and may ari&s;e from a natural &s;oftne&s;s and genero&s;ity of temper and con&s;titution, or from other cau&s;e&s; and motives. Thus our mother country is &s;aid to abound in this kind of charity. Hence a noted writer of their own &s;ays, <Q>They hope
<PB N="31" REF="012430_0016_0F8997DFF2367248">
their charity will cover the multitude of their &s;ins; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Salm. Geo. p. 226.</NOTE> and &s;ave them from de&s;tructi|on.</Q> But an in&s;pired writer intimates, that "we may give all our goods to feed the poor," yet be de&s;titute of charity. Beneficence is in|deed the genuine effect of true charity: and it tends on proper occa&s;ions to cover the &s;ins of others, but to purge out and de&s;troy our own. Not to expect &s;alvation in them, but to be &s;av|ed from them. <HI>For this cau&s;e was the Son of God manife&s;ted, to take away our &s;ins, and to de|&s;troy the works of the devil.</HI> On the other hand, it is the tendency of this &s;pecies of modern charity, by benefactions to purcha&s;e a &s;alvation con&s;i&s;tent with the life and power of &s;in. A meer ideal project, ari&s;ing from the DECEIT|FULNESS of &s;in.</P>
<P>In &s;ome, it &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t in a good opinion of others, while living; but e&s;pecially to find them out in heaven, evidence or not, when dead and gone. Apo&s;tolic charity wi&s;hes the eternal &s;alvation of men ardently; but is no blind and credulous principle, forming opinions and maxims without foundation to &s;upport them. Sometimes it is garni&s;hed with the epi|thet of <HI>catholick:</HI> and &s;o extends its good opi|nion to all parties and profe&s;&s;ions of men, how|ever different and oppo&s;ite in their &s;entiments and practice. This evinces that it has no prin|ciples of its own, or ba&s;is for its &s;upport. [Ac|cording

<P>But from the whole we may note,</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT the bi&s;hops are of the mind they ought to give us law, and that we ought to receive it from them.

<P N="4">4. THE clamours made again&s;t us in church and &s;tate, have one and the &s;ame meaning. Their general object is one; to bring on a revolution in church and &s;tate, and &s;ubvert our liberties, which have o&s;t us dear.</P>
<P N="5">5.

It may be remarked, the were it not for a particular de&s;ign, it would be &s;omewhat difficult to account for their keeping up their clamours again&s;t the colonies; for they &s;ay they have gained over a third part of the people to their pro|fe&s;&s;ion; "So that now there is a goodly appearance of reli|gion."

And our people, as de|generate as they be, &s;till de&s;erve at lea&s;t as good a character for religion and morality as <HI>their</HI> converts.</P>
<P>IT is very ea&s;y for men in their turns, once a year, when they have a de&s;ign to &s;erve, to mount the de&s;k and exclaim again&s;t a whole country of people three thou&s;and miles off, at all adventures; e&s;pecially when they have the advantage of taking the de&s;cription from their own country.

<P>If this be true, the whole head is &s;ick, and the whole heart faint. As there is confe&s;&s;edly no godly di&s;cipline in the church, &s;o there is no execution of laws by civil magi&s;trates for &s;up|pre&s;&s;ion of vice and debauchery.

It is reported, that in &s;ome of our populous towns the laws again&s;t vice, particularly prophane|ne&s;s are openly trampled on with too little notice of authority. If this be the ca&s;e, it will &s;pread it&s;elf like a contagion, our children will be ruined, and woe to this land! <HI>Woe unto thee if my &s;oul depart from thee.</HI> Wherefore be &s;trong, and quit you like men. All the judi|cious and good people in the land will be with you: And what is infinitely more <HI>Jeho|vah</HI> will be with you.</P>
<P>YOUR honours will remember withal, that though as rulers you &s;u&s;tain the exalted cha|racter

<P>WILL your honours indulge us another word? This re&s;pectable body has often been minded of the <HI>public good,</HI> as the object of atten|tion, and the end of your in&s;titution; but when particulars have been entered on, there is one point has &s;carcely ever been touched; which may be one rea&s;on it has been &s;o little thought of, and attended to by the legi&s;lature, and yet may be viewed as a point of great importance to the public; be&s;ure when it comes to our own per&s;onal ca&s;e, we are wont to view it in that light: And it is &s;trange it is not more con&s;idered in that light by the public. Our lives and health we are wont to regard above every thing in the pre&s;ent world, and the foun|dation of all the re&s;t: and the vital and &s;alu|tary &s;prings in this curious animated machine, which is <HI>fearfully and wonderfully</HI> made, lie deep and much out of common ob&s;ervation; and are liable to a va&s;t variety of accidents, by which health is impaired and life endan|gered. There are healing remedies provided by the author of nature for many of the&s;e ca&s;es: but when the patient is taken into the hand of &s;uch as have never been at the pains to penetrate into the human &s;tructure, to learn

wherein a healthy &s;tate con&s;i&s;ts, what is e&s;&s;en|tial to it, nor to learn the nature of medicine, the doctrine of di&s;ea&s;es, their cau&s;es, &s;ymp|toms and curative indications, nor to di&s;tin|gui&s;h between things that differ, his ca&s;e is danger of proving fatal for want of &s;kill, when it was not &s;o in the nature and cir|cumstances of it. And we being as unable to di&s;tingui&s;h between the pro&s;e&s;&s;ors of the medical art as many of them are between the objects of their profe&s;&s;ion, &s;ecurely repair to them, as an ox to the &s;laughter, and a bird to the &s;nare of the fowler, not knowing that it is for our life. It is as impo&s;&s;ible to be able practitioners in the more common way without &s;tudying the principles of their pro|fe&s;&s;ion, as it is to be mathematicians without the knowledge of figures, or to under&s;tand the motions and &s;ituation of the heavenly bo|dies without the &s;tudy of a&s;tronomy. It is an affair, may it plea&s;e your honours, of &s;o much con&s;equence, that in many countries it has commanded the attention of the civil &s;tate, both ancient and modern, Will not charity to this people call for &s;ome inquiries in this re&s;pectable body, whether the art of healing may not, at lea&s;t gradually, be put upon &s;ome more re&s;pectable footing. We have &s;ome among us of that profe&s;&s;ion, of a penetrating and inqui|&s;itive genius, worthy of honour; and there no

<P>HONOURED &s;enators, we wi&s;h you a ble&s;&s;ing out of the hou&s;e of God&mdash;that he will <HI>guide you by his coun&s;el and afterward receive you to glory.</HI></P>
<P>AND now in the next place it may be &s;aid, that among all the &s;ubjects of God's moral kingdom, there is no order of men who &s;tand in greater need of being the &s;ubjects of the kind and efficatious influence of charity than tho&s;e who are to feed the &s;heep and the lambs of Chri&s;t's flock.</P>
<P>Wherefore,</P>
<P>REVEREND and highly e&s;teemed in love for your work &s;ake; How &s;ublime, how worthy, and how ponderous the tru&s;t committed to you! too weighty for the &s;houlders of angels. And how excellent the depo&s;ited trea&s;ure! yet 'tis committed to earthen ve&s;&s;els; frail, feeble and &s;inful mortals! but, behold, here is wi&s;dom&mdash;<HI>That the excellence of the power may be of God, and not of us.</HI> Wherefore your dig|nity in the eye of your Lord and ma&s;ter, and your &s;ucce&s;s with depend much on your cha|rity, in which is included humility, meekne&s;s and dependence.

object is truth, and the inculcating of it on the minds of men, for the eternal intere&s;t of individuals and the good of commmunity. You are <HI>to put them in mind to obey magi&s;|trates, to be ready to every good work:</HI> And to <HI>follow peace with all men, and holine&s;s, with|out which none &s;hall &s;ee the Lord.</HI> You are to <HI>give your&s;elves to reading, to meditation and to prayer (for who is &s;ufficient for the&s;e thing) that your pro&s;iting may appear to all</HI>&mdash;And that you may be as &s;cribes well in&s;tructed to the kingdom of heaven, able to bring forth out of your trea&s;ure, which is inexhau&s;table, things both new and old. If you love your ma&s;ter, you will love his cau&s;e, love your people, love mankind and one another&mdash;Well <HI>take heed to your&s;elves and your doctrine, that you may both &s;ave your own &s;ouls and them who hear you.</HI> The &s;ame mind will <HI>be in you which al&s;o was in Chri&s;t Jesus.</HI> And you with <HI>&s;trive together for the faith of the go&s;pel</HI>: Avoiding <HI>all bitter|ne&s;s, wrath, malice, envy and evil &s;peaking</HI>&mdash;Thinks what a mixture of indignation and piety is &s;ome times rai&s;ed in &s;etious and judicious brea&s;t, (in reading &s;ome public and incon&s;i&s;tency of the author with his profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign and motive in writing, a regard to truth; and avoid it.

after truth. But dear brethren, while you contend earne&s;tly for the faith once delivered to the &s;aints, remember that he <HI>who has cho&s;en you ia this warfare, rides pro&s;perou&s;ly, becau&s;e of truth,</HI> through the influence of truth, <HI>meek|ne&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s:</HI> And remember that your brother will determine, and all judicious men will determine that you have no more right to treat him with contempt, rancour and virulence than he has to treat you in the &s;ame manner. And though &s;uch conduct may plea&s;e the corruption or gratify the viciated humours of a party, yet it ordinarily &s;ub&s;erves not the object in view, or which ought to be in view. Verily this wi&s;dom comes not from above. You need not then be told the quality and ri&s;e of it: For we &s;peak as to wi&s;e men. In a word, which is to &s;ay all above all things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectne&s;s, and will animate you in the &s;acred employment, render you &s;olicitous to be <HI>free from the blood of all men.</HI> And to that end you will make Chri&s;t and his atone|ment and tho&s;e truths in clo&s;e connexion therewith, the grand theme of your mini&s;tra|tions; will render you faithful unto death, and your end will be everla&s;ting life. We are &s;tuards of the my&s;teries of God, and it is required of &s;tuards that a man be found faith|ful: And the time is coming when it will be

<P>NEXT we turn to the freemen of this cor|poration. The continuation, gentlemen, of our &s;ingular ble&s;&s;ings under God, depend much on you. Will not charity to this beloved colony, to your country, to your wives, your &s;ons and daughter, children of God's people, a nume|rous ri&s;ing generation, influence your minds and conduct to be faithful to your tru&s;t, <HI>to remember the oath of God which is upon you</HI>; not only to be true and faithful to his maje&s;|ty, but to the intere&s;ts of this dear colony as e&s;tabli&s;hed by charter? And let us always have cho&s;en out from among us wi&s;e, uuder&s;tand|ing and faithful men, to have the rule over us, and to be guardians of our di&s;tingui&s;hing rights? and to perpetuate them to posterity, Now the end of the commandment is charity.</P>

repentance was &s;uperficial; What a &s;hining contra&s;t do our eyes now behold all over this land! The world rejoiceth, but will not cha|rity tremble? Is the bitterne&s;s of death pa&s;t? No, the arrows are &s;till pointed at the heart of our liberties. But not to dwell here. Cha|rity be&s;peaks your attention to the important objects of it and recommends it&s;elf to your entertainment from the innate worth and ex|cellence of it, and from the fruits and ble&s;&s;ings which never fail to attend it. It produces per|&s;onal joy un&s;peakable and full of glory. It &s;preads its kind influence on tho&s;e round about it. It is the bond of &s;ocial happine&s;s. It is the end of the commandment. It will &s;et us all right, in proportion to the degree and ex|tent of it, both in regard to God and one ano|ther. It will bring down the ble&s;&s;ing of hea|ven upon us, and we &s;hall be a happy people. <HI>The lion will lie down with the lamb,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;Love one another and walk in the light of the divine countenance.&mdash;We &s;hall be guided by the divine coun&s;el, and afterward received to glory, where love will for ever dwell and reign without mixture.</P>
