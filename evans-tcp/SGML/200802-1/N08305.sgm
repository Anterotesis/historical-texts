<P>_THE great and wi&s;e Creator of all Things, out of his own meer good Plea&s;ure, and for the Di&s;play of his own glorious Perfections, hath cre|ated all Things, both vi&s;ible and invi&s;ible, in Heaven above, and on the Earth beneath: He made the noble Creature, Man, after his own Image, and ordained him Lord of this lower World; then viewing his own Works, in their Beauty and Perfection, he pronounced them all very good. But it &s;eems not long, before this happy Scene was changed. Thro' the Subtilty of the old Serpent, Man was prevailed upon to rebel again&s;t his Maker, and break that &s;acred Covenant which included his Po&s;terity, and bro't him&s;elf, with his numerous Race, de&s;cending from him by or|dinary Generation, under the terrible Sentence of Death: upon which, Man was immediately driven out of the earthly Paradi&s;e, and his Return was guarded with the flaming Sword, which turneth every Way, to keep the Tree of Life. This &s;ad Revolt mu&s;t have procured God's amazing Wrath and Cur&s;e, both in this Life, and that which is to

come, had not a merciful GOD, out of his infinite Wi&s;dom and Grace, laid a &s;ure Foundation in his Son, for the Pardon of the Guilty, and re&s;toring them to his Favor, and making them happy in the Enjoyment of him&s;elf forever. This Way of Salvation God was plea&s;ed to make known unto Adam in that early Promi&s;e, that the Seed of the Woman &s;hould brui&s;e the Serpent's Head. And he was plea&s;ed to unfold this Mi&s;tery of divine Grace, more and more, until the Fullne&s;s of the Time was come, that this glorious Savior &s;hould make his Appearance in this World, and reveal his marvelous Grace fully un|der the go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation. This glorious Savior was prophe&s;ied of, under the Similitude of a Found|ation, I&s;a. xxviii. 16. <HI>Behold I lay in Zion for a Found|ation, a Stone, a tried Stone, a precious corner Stone, a &s;ure Foundation.</HI> The Apo&s;tle particularly applies this to CHRIST, Eph. ii. 10. <HI>And are built upon the Foundation of the Apo&s;tles, and Prophets Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf being the chief Corner Stone.</HI> In our Context the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, by the Grace of GOD, he had, with all Care and Application, preached the impor|tant Doctrines of the Go&s;pel, leading his Hearers unto CHRIST, as the great and &s;ure Foundation on which his Church is built, and the Gates of Hell &s;hall never prevail again&s;t it; and all tho&s;e who be|lieve this Truth, and cordially receive CHRIST for their Savior, he calls GOD'S Building. A happy Su|per&s;tructure upon CHRIST as the Foundation, who is able to &s;upport all their Hopes of eternal Life! And other Foundation can no Man lay, than that is laid, which is JESUS CHRIST. Whatever Pre|tences Man may make to other Foundation to build their Hopes upon, whatever other Doctrines &s;edu|cing

Teachers may preach; yet the Lord JESUS CHRIST, the eternal Son of GOD, who was cho&s;en of the Father, elect and precious, is the only Found|ation of the Salvation of Sinners; all the Ble&s;&s;ings of Providence and Grace, of a civil and religious Nature, come to us in and through him. Here many important Truths might be brought under our Con&s;ideration; but I &s;hall confine my Di&s;cour&s;e to a few Particulars under the&s;e general Heads:
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. That JESUS CHRIST is the Foundation of the Pardon and Salvation of Sinners.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. That JESUS CHRIST is the Foundation of ci|vil Government.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. That JESUS CHRIST is the Foundation of the wi&s;e and good Government e&s;tabli&s;hed in his Church.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I. That JESUS CHRIST is the Foundation of the Pardon and Salvation of Sinners. When we view the human Race fallen in Adam, their public and federal Head lying under the amazing Threatning of Death, which included in it all the Mi&s;eries of a temporal and &s;piritual Death, and the Pains of Hell forever. Horror and De&s;pair mu&s;t have &s;eized the Guilty; had not GOD, out of his own free and So|vereign Grace, provided a Way for the Pardon and Redemption of Sinners, in and thro' his Son the Lord JESUS CHRIST. When we con&s;ider this won|derful Mi&s;tery of divine Grace, opened unto us in the &s;acred Oracles of GOD, it &s;eems like Life from the Dead. Here the &s;acred and adorable Trinity are repre&s;ented doing their Part, in this marvelous Method of divine Grace, in bringing about the Sal|vation of Sinners; and here JESUS CHRIST lays as the Foundation;&mdash;which may be illu&s;trated in a few Particulars.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="6" REF="010605_0006_0F80EFD0D113FA90">
1. JESUS CHRIST is the Foundation, as he becomes our Surety in the Covenant of Redemption made between the Father and the Son. The Covenant of Redemption was that eternal Compact made be|tween the Father and the Son, concerning the Sal|vation of Sinners, in which the Father makes great and precious Promi&s;es to his Son, that he would furni&s;h him for, a&s;&s;i&s;t him in, and give him Succe&s;s in this important Undertaking, I&s;ai. xlii. at the Beginning. And the Son engages to &s;ecure the di|vine Honor, and procure Salvation for all tho&s;e in|cluded in the Covenant. The great Immanuel &s;ays, <HI>Lo I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> do thy Will, O God.</HI> Heb. x. 7. In this Covenant we may conceive the Father addre&s;&s;ing his Son in &s;ome &s;uch Language as this&mdash;"My Son, behold here the Po&s;terity of fallen Adam, who have utterly undone them&s;elves by Sin, and my Ju&s;tice requires Satisfaction, and if it takes Place on them, they will be mi&s;erable to all Eternity. What can be done for their Salvation? I am willing to admit a Surety." The Son replies, "O my Father, &s;uch is my Compa&s;&s;ion for the&s;e mi&s;erable Sinners, I will undertake for them, I will be their Surety, I will do and &s;uffer for them all your Ju&s;tice demands." The Father &s;ays, "If you undertake for them, my Son&punc; you mu&s;t expect no Favor on Account of your being my only and beloved Son; it will co&s;t you dear." The Son an&s;wers, "I am content to bear any Thing. Tho' I mu&s;t leave thy Throne, thy Bo&s;om, and vail my Glory in the Fle&s;h&mdash;tho' I mu&s;t &s;uffer thy Wrath, which will fill me with the utmo&s;t Di&s;|tre&s;s in Soul and Body; yet &s;uch is my Love, I am willing to tread the Wine-pre&s;s of thy Wrath alone, that the&s;e poor, &s;inful, helple&s;s Creatures might
<PB N="7" REF="010605_0007_0F80EFD26911C370">
be pardoned, and re&s;tored to thy Favor, and be hap|py in the Enjoyment of Thee forever." Thus we may conceive the Father and the Son &s;tipulating with each other, and coming into mutual Engage|ments, to do what was requi&s;ite to lay a &s;ure Found|ation for the Salvation of Sinners. This Compact which was made in the Days of Eternity, is open'd unto us in the Covenant of Grace. Which brings me to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="2">2. JESUS CHRIST is the Foundation, as he is the Mediator of the Covenant of Grace made between GOD and Man. The Covenant of Redemption made between the Father and the Son, opened the Way for the Covenant of Grace to be propound|ed to the &s;inful Children of Men. This Covenant contains in it all that Sinners need to re&s;tore them again to the Favor of God, that they might be happy in the Enjoyment of him. In this Cove|nant, the glorious Mediator is exhibited, di&s;playing the mo&s;t &s;urprizing Conde&s;cention, in the mi&s;teri|ous Union of the divine and human Nature, in the Per&s;on of the Mediator: <HI>For God &s;ent forth his Son, made of a Woman, made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law,</HI> Gal. iv. 4, 5. And being made under the Law, he did, as Mediator fulfil the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Law, and yield that Obe|dience which the Law required of Sinners, which they were not able to perform, and &s;o is become the End of the Law for Righteou&s;ne&s;s to them that believe, Rom. x. 4. He has al&s;o &s;uffered the full Cur&s;e of the Law due unto Sinners, and made compleat Satisfaction to divine Ju&s;tice; that GOD can, con&s;i&s;tent with his glorious Perfections, par|don and &s;ave Sinners. Rom. iii. 26. And now Re|pentance
<PB N="8" REF="010605_0008_0F80EFD3179F1E80">
and Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins are preached in His Name. The Terms of our Acceptance with GOD, are plainly propounded in the Go&s;pel; we mu&s;t have Repentance towards GOD, and Faith in the Lord JESUS CHRIST&mdash;that Faith which unites us to him, and makes us Partakers of him; and being in CHRIST, no more any Condemnation belongs to us. Rom. viii. 1. We are made new Creatures, re|conciled unto GOD, adopted into his Family, and have A&s;&s;urance of his Grace, to qualify us for, and bring us finally unto Glory; &s;o that we may well &s;ay, <HI>There is no other Name given under Heaven, where|by we can be &s;aved, but Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Thus the Me|diator has prepared the Way for the &s;olemn tran&s;|acting of the Covenant of Grace, which we may con|ceive of in &s;ome &s;uch Way as this,</P>
<P N="1">1. CHRIST the Mediator, &s;ays to GOD the Father, <HI>"Lo, O Father! I have done thy Will.</HI>&mdash;The Obedi|ence the Law required of the&s;e Sinners, which they were not able to perform, I have fulfiled; the Sentence of Death that was out again&s;t the&s;e Sin|ners, I have &s;uffered for their Sakes; this, Father, was what you required of me, in Order to their Sal|vation: Now, Father, glorify thy Grace on the&s;e peri&s;hing Sinners, for my Sake be reconciled unto them, and receive them into thy peculiar Favor."&mdash;The glorious Mediator &s;ays to poor Sinners, "Now freely accept me for your Savior, upon my own Terms&mdash;receive me by Faith, for the Lord your Righteou&s;ne&s;s; rely on the Merit of my Blood, to purge you from all Sin, and re&s;tore you to the Fa|vor of GOD; then how aggravated &s;oever your Sins have been, and how de&s;perate &s;oever your Ca&s;e may appear in your own Eyes, yet I am able to &s;ave
<PB N="9" REF="010605_0009_0F80EFD3D909F920">
you to the uttermo&s;t, all you who will come to GOD, in and thro' me."</P>
<P N="2">2. In the Covenant of Grace, the Father &s;ays to Sinners, "The Price my Son has paid by his Righ|teous Life, his cruel Sufferings and Death, is to my full Satisfaction: I am willing to acquit you from Condemnation, and receive you into my Favor, and make you my Sons, and be&s;tow upon you all tho&s;e precious Gifts and Graces, which will fit and qualify you for Heaven and Happine&s;s. I delight, &s;ays GOD, to glorify my Grace in this Way of your Conver&s;ion and Salvation. O, Sin|ners! Why will you remain ob&s;tinate and impeni|tent? Why will you die, when I &s;tand with open Arms, full of Grace and Mercy, to receive you in|to my Embraces, and be&s;tow upon you all the Ble&s;|&s;ings of the Covenant of Grace?"</P>
<P N="3">3. The Sinner viewing the Covenant of Grace, with divine Light let into his Soul, with Admirati|on replies, "O, what Manner of Love is this! Not that I loved GOD, but he fir&s;t loved me, and gave his Son to die for me. Here is a Savior exactly &s;uited to my &s;ad Ca&s;e; and the Terms of GOD'S accepting me, in CHRIST, are rea&s;onable and good: I will therefore, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Holy Spirit, take GOD the Father, for my GOD and Father, in JESUS CHRIST, and take the Lord JESUS CHRIST for my Savior and Redeemer, upon his own Terms. I will take the HOLY SPIRIT for my In&s;tructor and Sanctifier, that the whole Work of Grace may be carried on in me, to the Glory of GOD the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit." Thus, the Covenant of Grace is propounded by GOD to Sinners, thro' the Mediator, and complied with by poor Sinners; and
<PB N="10" REF="010605_0010_0F80EFD5197FEC70">
the Terms of Peace and Reconciliation are &s;ettled again between GOD and Man, thro' CHRIST, as the Foundation of their Salvation.</P>
<P N="3">3. JESUS CHRIST is the Foundation, as he doth by the Holy Spirit, apply the Redemption he had purcha&s;ed, unto the Soul of Sinners, and brings them up to the Terms, and makes them Partakers of all the Ble&s;&s;ings of the Covenant of Grace.&mdash;The ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, the third Per&s;on in the adora|ble Trinity, applies the Redemption purcha&s;ed by CHRIST unto poor Sinners, and &s;o makes them Partakers of the precious Benefits of the Covenant of Grace, of which CHRIST is the Foundation. This important Work is &s;ometimes, in Scripture, a&s;cribed to the Father, John vi. 14. <HI>No Man cometh unto me, except the Father which hath &s;ent me draw him.</HI> Sometimes it is a&s;cribed to the Son&punc; John xii. 32. <HI>And I</HI> (&s;ays the Redeemer) <HI>if I be lifted up from the Earth, will draw all Men unto me.</HI> But it is empha|tically applied to the Holy Gho&s;t as a Work proper for him in the Salvation of Sinners: And therefore CHRIST a&s;&s;ures his Di&s;ciples, that when he &s;hould leave them, and go unto the Father, he would &s;end the Comforter, the Holy Spirit unto them, John xvi. 7. <HI>If I go not away, the Comforter</HI> (which means the Holy Gho&s;t) <HI>will not come unto you; but if I de|part, I will &s;end him unto you;</HI> not only to endue you with Power from on High, to furni&s;h you for extraordinary Services in his Church; but effectual|ly call and &s;anctify all them who &s;hall be &s;aved. <HI>He &s;hall glorify me</HI> (&s;ays CHRIST) <HI>for he &s;hall receive of mine, and &s;hall &s;hew it unto you.</HI> John xvi. 14. He &s;hall open the Doctrines of Grace in a powerful and &s;aving Light; and apply the Merits of Chri&s;t with
<PB N="11" REF="010605_0011_0F80EFD5746AA3E0">
&s;uch a divine Energy, that Sinners are &s;aid to be regenerated and born again, of the Spirit. Joh iii. 6. The Holy Spirit, in bringing Sinners to Salvation by JESUS CHRIST, always applies the Redemption pur|cha&s;ed by CHRIST, by working Faith in them, and thereby uniting them to CHRIST, in their effectual Calling. Here I &s;hall a little enlarge, in &s;hewing how the Spirit works upon the Hearts of Sinners, in bringing them up to the Terms of the Covenant of Grace, in applying the Redemption purcha&s;ed by CHRIST.</P>
<P N="1">1. In convincing them of their Sin and Mi&s;ery, and &s;o making them in Earne&s;t for Salvation. The fir&s;t Work of the Spirit upon the Hearts of Sinners, is to enlighten the Mind, and awaken the Con&s;cience to an affecting Concern for their own Salvation: And from a Di&s;covery of their &s;inful and mi&s;erable State, they cry, <HI>What &s;hall we do to be &s;aved?</HI> This is the Work of the Spirit; for when he comes, &s;ays CHRIST, he &s;hall reprove the World of Sin, John xvi. 8. When he leads the Sinner into the Know|ledge of his own Heart and Ways, and he &s;ees him|&s;elf altogether defiled and polluted with Sin, for which he de&s;erves to be made mi&s;erable in this Life, and that which is to come: And alas! he &s;ees he can't help him&s;elf, he can't redeem his own Soul, or give to GOD a Ran&s;om for it: He is &s;trip'd of all Confidence in his Duties, and good Di&s;po|&s;itions, and &s;ees, that all his Refuges he has betaken him&s;elf to, will not &s;ave him from the Storm of GOD'S dreadful Wrath. A deep Sen&s;e of his Sin and Mi&s;ery, brings him as a guilty Criminal un|to the Foot of GOD, with earne&s;t Cries for Mercy, Mercy: He &s;ees that Nothing but free Grace can
<PB N="12" REF="010605_0012_0F80EFD60C015958">
&s;ave him from the Pit of everla&s;ting De&s;truction. Thus the poor, guilty Sinner &s;tands trembling be|fore an angry GOD, and &s;ees all his awful Threat|nings pointed right at his Heart, and ready to fall upon him.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Holy Spirit enlightens the guilty Sinner, into the Knowledge of CHRIST, and the Way of Salvation in and thro' him. The Holy Spirit un|folds the Mi&s;tery of the Covenant of Grace reveal|ed in the Go&s;pel, and &s;hews the poor Sinner the Savior GOD has provided; and, as it were pointing to CHRIST, &s;ays, "Behold, O Sinner! that GOD, who&s;e Wrath you fear, has found a Ran&s;om for you&mdash;he has given his beloved Son to be your Savior, and he is an almighty Savior, exactly &s;uited to your Ca&s;e; what you find you can't do, he has done for you; what you fear &s;uffering, as the ju&s;t De&s;ert of your Sins, he has &s;uffered for you: He has endured the amazing Wrath of God, in his Body and Soul, for your Sake and Salvation: He has paid a full Price for your Redemption, and he has Power &s;uf|ficient to &s;ave you from what you feel and fear. And there is infinite Safety in appearing before GOD, in the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of CHRIST; and his Blood clean&s;|eth from all Sin." Thus the Holy Spirit enlightens the Under&s;tanding of the Sinner, into the Know|ledge of CHRIST, and the Terms of the Covenant of Grace, and the Way of the Salvation of Sinners propounded in the Go&s;pel, and the Sinner's A&s;&s;ent to all. Then,</P>
<P N="3">3. The Holy Spirit renews the Sinner's Will, and brings him to accept of, and rely upon CHRIST for Pardon, and compleat Salvation. While the Spirit enlightens the Under&s;tanding, to behold the
<PB N="13" REF="010605_0013_0F80EFD934D1B698">
Glory and Excellency of CHRIST, as the Savior of poor peri&s;hing Sinners, the Will is renewed, per|&s;waded and enabled to &s;ay, "This is the Savior I cho&s;e for mine: Tho' I have &s;ought Happine&s;s in other Things, yet could never find Ea&s;e to my Con&s;cience. The Refuges I have betaken my&s;elf to, have proved Refuges of Lies: But in this Sa|vior GOD has provided, there is Nothing wanting: He is every Way compleat, he is altogether lovely; and with all my Heart I take him for mine upon his own Terms. I re&s;olve I will be his forever. I &s;ee GOD can, con&s;i&s;tent with his own glorious Per|fections, ju&s;tify me thro' CHRIST, and receive me again into his Favor, and this is the only Way I can hope, and do de&s;ire to be &s;aved." Now the whole Soul relies upon CHRIST, and can &s;afely tru&s;t in him for Pardon and Salvation. Thus the Union be|tween CHRIST and the Believer is brought about, and Salvation is &s;ecured to all &s;uch, upon the Terms of the Covenant of Grace. O! remember, if you chu&s;e CHRIST upon his Terms, you will find them directly cro&s;s to Fle&s;h and Blood; for you mu&s;t be dive&s;ted of all Confidence in your&s;elves, and de|&s;ire to be found of GOD in CHRIST: And you mu&s;t be willing to deny all Ungodline&s;s and every worldly Lu&s;t, and live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly, and godly in this pre&s;ent evil World. You mu&s;t take CHRIST with his Cro&s;s, as well as his Crown, and have the whole chri&s;tian Temper formed in you, and influ|encing you to the Practice of all chri&s;tian Duties; and &s;o adorn the Doctrine of GOD your Savior in all Things; that you may have the Evidence in your&s;elves, and manife&s;t to others, that the Holy Spirit has applied the Redemption purcha&s;ed by
<PB N="14" REF="010605_0014_0F80EFDA6B1144C0">
CHRIST unto you for your Salvation; and &s;o the Heart is prepared to a&s;cribe his whole Salvation un|to CHRIST from the Foundation, to the bringing in of the Top-Stone of his Salvation with Shouts, cry|ing Grace, Grace.</P>
<P>II. That JESUS CHRIST is the Foundation of ci|vil Government. That glorious Per&s;on who is the Ba&s;is of all the Hopes and Happine&s;s of GOD'S People, he is the great Creator of all Things, John i. 3. <HI>All Things were made by him; and without him was not any Thing made that was made;</HI> and it is his Right and Prerogative to rule in the Kingdom of Providence, and govern all the Affairs of the up|per and lower World: The Prophet I&s;aiah &s;peaks of him as having the Government of the Univer&s;e devolved upon him, ixth Chap. 6th Ver. <HI>The Go|vernment &s;hall be upon his Shoulder.</HI> When our Sa|vior was about to give his la&s;t Commi&s;&s;ion to his Apo&s;tles, ju&s;t before his A&s;cention into Glory, he &s;ays, Matt. xxviii. 18. <HI>All Power is given unto me, in Heaven and in Earth.</HI> By his Wi&s;dom and Pow|er he conducts all the Affairs of his providential Government, and accompli&s;hes his own Purpo&s;es; altho' he makes U&s;e of Means and In&s;truments yet he him&s;elf always &s;tands as the Wheel with|in the Wheel, in Ezekiel's Vi&s;ion, to direct all the Motions of &s;econd Cau&s;es, that nothing &s;hall ever happen without his &s;pecial Direction. This glorious Per&s;on hath on his Ve&s;ture and on his Thigh, a Name written, (which be&s;peaks his &s;ove|reign Dominion in the Kingdom of Men) <HI>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</HI> Rev. xix. 16. He &s;ets up and pulls down, when he will, at his Plea&s;ure. Tho' the Forms of civil Government are various,
<PB N="15" REF="010605_0015_0F80EFDA8BEE0808">
in Kingdoms and Nations, yet it is calculated in each of them, for the general Good of the Body Politic. And all tho&s;e who are promoted to Places of Rule and Government, receive their Power from him, who is the ble&s;&s;ed and only Potentate, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, 1 Tim. vi. 15. I &s;hall illu&s;trate the Truth before us, in the follow|ing Particulars. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. Civil Rulers receive their Power and Autho|rity from CHRIST. The Apo&s;tle, &s;peaking of ci|vil Magi&s;trates, &s;ays, <HI>The Powers that be, are ordain|ed of God.</HI> Rom. xiii. 1. CHRIST, the Wi&s;dom of GOD, proclaims, Prov. viii. 15, 16. <HI>By me Kings reign, and Princes decree Ju&s;tice: By me Princes rule, and Nobles, even all the Judges of the Earth.</HI> This important Subject has been &s;o often well illu&s;trated on the like Occa&s;ion, that I &s;hall proceed to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="2">2. CHRIST directs and regulates Rulers in their Duty. This great and wi&s;e Governor has given Ru|lers wi&s;e and general Maxims in his &s;acred Word, by which they may form a good Plan of Govern|ment, and has furni&s;hed them with compleat Pow|er to make good Laws, and enforce Obedience on all, by proper Sanctions. By his own Authority he has laid the mo&s;t powerful Re&s;traint upon Rulers, to keep them from all unju&s;t &amp; oppre&s;&s;ive Mea&s;ures, by a&s;&s;uring them they &s;hall die like other Men, and &s;tand at his Bar, and give a &s;trict Account of their Con|duct as Rulers. The Lord of all expects and requires that they have a principal View at his Glory, in all they do, in their different Offices. And in Subordina|tion to the Glory of GOD, they are to exerci&s;e their Authority for the Good of the Ruled. You mu&s;t be a Mini&s;ter of GOD to his People for Good: You are

not to be a Terror to the Good, but to the Evil; and make them know, you do not bear the Sword in vain. The &s;weet Laws of our mo&s;t holy Religi|on, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uling in your Hearts, and attended to in your public Admini&s;trations, will mo&s;t happily direct you in your Duties, and make you reach the good End of Government.</P>
<P N="3">3. CHRIST requires all due Subjection and Obe|dience to Rulers, as his Mini&s;ters. By the Autho|rity of the King of Kings, you are not only requir|ed to fear GOD, but honor the King, 1 Pet. ii. 17. paying due Reverence to his Vice-gerents, <HI>Submit|ting to every Ordinance of Man, for the Lord's Sake; whether it be to the King, as Supreme, or unto Gover|nors, as unto them that are &s;ent by him, for the Puni&s;h|ment of Evil-Doers, and for the Prai&s;e of them that do well.</HI> 13, 14 Ver. You mu&s;t be &s;ubject to civil Government out of Con&s;cience, and Obedience unto GOD, by obeying the Laws, and willingly contribu|ting to their honorable Support, paying Tribute to whom Tribute is due; giving full Proof of your Loyalty, by your earne&s;t Prayer for them; accord|ing to that divine. Exhortation, 1 Tim. ii. 1, 2, 3. <HI>I exhort, therefore, that fir&s;t of all, Supplications, Pray|ers, and Interce&s;&s;ions, and giving of Thanks, be made for all Men; for Kings, and all that are in Authority, that they may lead a quiet and peaceable Life, in all Godli|ne&s;s and Hone&s;ty; for this is good and acceptable in the Sight of God our Savior.</HI> Thus he who has the Go|vernment on his Shoulders, has inve&s;ted you with Power to act for him, and directed you in the wi&s;e Exertion of it, for the Good of his People; and re|quires that Subjection, which will make your Go|vernment ea&s;y and beneficial and prove the length|ening

out of our Tranquility, under the happy Privileges which this Government has been long favored with.</P>
<P>III. That JESUS CHRIST is the Foundation of the wi&s;e and good Government e&s;tabli&s;hed in his Church. The great Governor among the Nations, &s;preads his divine Influences thro' the whole Univer&s;e, with a peculiar De&s;ign for the good of his Church, to &s;upport it on the Foundation already laid; and he is Head over all Things to the Church, Eph. i. 13. He has re&s;erved to him&s;elf the whole Authority to give Laws to his own Kingdom, and none may teach for Doctrines the Commandments of Men, to bind their Con&s;ciences. CHRIST, the glorious Head, has given to his Church, all nece&s;&s;ary Doctrines and Laws, in his &s;acred Oracles: <HI>And if any &s;hall pre|&s;ume to add unto the&s;e Things, God &s;hall add unto him all the Plagues that are written in this Book: And if any Man &s;hall take away from the Words of the Book of this Prophecy, God &s;hall take away his Part out of the Book of Life.</HI> Rev. xxii. 18, 19. CHRIST governs in his Church, by accompanying the Doctrines of Grace with &s;uch powerful Influences, as to make his People willing and obedient unto him. Tho&s;e important Doctrines which are plainly revealed in GOD'S Word, are made powerful on the Heart of GOD'S People, &s;o as to awaken &s;ecure Sinners; to humble proud Sinners; and bring them to renounce all Confidence in any Thing they have, or can do, to recommend them to the divine Favor. <HI>They de|&s;ire,</HI> with the Apo&s;tle, <HI>to be found in Chri&s;t, not ha|ving on their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, which is of the Law, but that which is thro' the Faith of Chri&s;t, the Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s which is by Faith,</HI> Phil. iii. 9. And having
<PB N="18" REF="010605_0018_0F80EFDCCAC79CF0">
received CHRIST by Faith, and become united unto him, they receive &s;uch &s;piritual Influences from CHRIST their Head, that they bring forth Fruit, in their different Stations among Men, to the Prai&s;e and Glory of GOD. He has furni&s;hed them with &s;uch a Variety of important Truths in his &s;acred Word, that they may grow in Knowledge and Grace, and be directed in all virtuous Living, and become Ornaments to the Church, of which CHRIST is Head, and u&s;eful Members of civil Community. CHRIST will take Care that the important Doctrines of Religion be maintained, and that Religion, in the Power and Practice of it, more or le&s;s prevails. He will rule in the Hearts of his own Children, and train them up, in his Church Militant, to become Members of the Church Triumphant. But while the Church is in this imperfect State, their will be Corruption in Doctrines and Practice; and there|fore the wi&s;e Governor has e&s;tabli&s;hed good Laws, to direct his Church, in a faithful Dealing with all &s;uch Offenders, to bring them to a Sight and Sen&s;e of their Sins and Errors, that they might repent, and obtain Mercy and Forgivene&s;s. But if they remain obstinate, after proper Means have been u&s;ed, and Patience exerci&s;ed; they mu&s;t be cut off as fruitle&s;s and corrupt Members. Now, that the&s;e Laws of Di&s;cipline might be more ea&s;ily under&s;tood, and practi&s;ed upon, it has been the Practice of all chri&s;tian Churches, in all Ages, to collect the Laws of CHRIST, in&s;tituted for the Government of his Church, into &s;hort Sy&s;tems. And altho' none of the&s;e, as far as they are Human, may be e&s;teemed perfect, but in &s;ome Things may need Amendation; yet, perhaps, none more agreable to the Pattern
<PB N="19" REF="010605_0019_0F80EFDE23C9F8D8">
given us in GOD'S Word, than what our Fore-Fathers have drawn up to our Hand, in our eccle&s;i|a&s;tical Con&s;titution, which has received the Appro|bation of the legi&s;lative Authority of this Govern|ment. Here the Rights and Liberties of particular Churches are maintained; and the Power of parti|cular Churches, in the Management of Di&s;cipline, in Relation to any Scandals that fall out within the &s;ame, is clearly a&s;&s;erted and maintained. And that Churches might afford to each other, &s;uch mutual A&s;&s;i&s;tance as may be requi&s;ite, upon all Occa&s;ions eccle&s;ia&s;tical; neighbouring Churches are to form into a Con&s;ociation; and all Ca&s;es of Scandal and Here&s;y, falling out within their Limits, are to be there tried and i&s;&s;ued, unle&s;s the Matter is &s;o great in its Nature, &s;o doubtful in the I&s;&s;ue, or of &s;uch general Concern, that it be thought be&s;t to call a neighbouring Con&s;ociation, to i&s;&s;ue and determine &s;uch a Ca&s;e. This Con&s;titution has made Provi&s;ion for the fair Trial of Criminals, and for the Relief of the aggrieved. And if you look carefully into the Form of Proceeding, you will find it well calcu|lated to an&s;wer the good End of Government in the Church. We &s;hould e&s;teem it a &s;pecial Favor of the Great Head of the Church, that we have &s;o wi&s;e and good Con&s;titution e&s;tabli&s;hed in our Church|es: And may it be a Means of guiding, purging, and defending the Church, which is built upon CHRIST as the Foundation, that the Gates of Hell may never prevail again&s;t it; but Religion may flouri&s;h, and the Church appear clear as the Moon, bright as the Sun, and terrible as an Army with Banners, Cant. vi. 4.</P>

<HEAD>IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. From what we have heard we may learn, that we &s;hould take &s;pecial Care how we build upon this Foundation. Tho&s;e who own CHRIST for the Found|ation of all their Hopes of Happine&s;s, had need be careful that their Building an&s;wer the Excellen|cy of the Foundation. There are precious Doctrines for you to adhere to, compared in our Context to Gold, Silver, and precious Stones: The&s;e will make us rich, honorable, and comfortable. Others who hold corrupt Doctrines, which lead to unwarranta|ble Practices, are compared to Wood, Hay, and Stubble. Whatever your Building is, remember, O Chri&s;tian! your Work &s;hall be made manife&s;t, for the Day &s;hall declare it; becau&s;e it &s;hall be reveal|ed by Fire; and the Fire &s;hall try every Man's Work, of what Sort it is, whether it be good or no. We are a&s;&s;ured this &s;hall be the Ca&s;e; let us take Heed how we build upon CHRIST, that we might reap the Benefit and Comfort of Religion, and be daily preparing for a glorious Manife&s;tation of our firm Adherence to CHRIST, and his &s;acred Truths.</P>
<P N="2">2. We learn, that the Foundation Men may lay, be&s;ides what is already laid, will certainly fail them. It is &s;uppo&s;ed in our Text, that Men will have &s;ome Foundation to build their eternal Hopes upon; and while &s;ome are building upon CHRIST, Others who profe&s;s Chri&s;tianity, will deny the peculiar Doc|trines of the Go&s;pel, and bring in damnable Here|&s;ies, denying the Lord who has bought them, and &s;o &s;trike at the Foundation GOD has laid. We can't but be &s;en&s;ible of a very &s;ad Corruption of the chri&s;tian Faith, &s;pread abroad in many Books, de|nying
<PB N="21" REF="010605_0021_0F80EFDF9573B300">
the Divinity of our ble&s;&s;ed Savior, and the Price he has paid by his righteous Life, and cruel Sufferings and Death, for our Redemption; and the &s;pecial Agency of the Holy Spirit, in applying the Redemption purcha&s;ed by CHRIST, thereby be|ginning, and carrying on the Work of Sanctification in the whole Man, and thus preparing for Glory and Happine&s;s. Perhaps there never was a Time when more dangerous Errors prevailed in our Land than at this Day: But we may be &s;ure that the Stone which the&s;e fooli&s;h Builders reject, is become the Head Stone of the Corner, in the Salvation of Sinners, P&s;alm cxviii. 22. However you may now treat the great Savior, and his precious Doctrines; e'er long your Faith and Hope will entirely fail you. If you now deny him before Men, he will deny you before his Father which is in Heaven, Matt. x. 33. You are now warned that all other Founda|tions will &s;ail: Therefore, look well to your&s;elves, that you build upon the Foundation of the Apo&s;|tles and Prophets, JESUS CHRIST him&s;elf being the chief Corner Stone, Eph. ii. 20.</P>
<P N="3">3. We learn, that we &s;hould attend to the Doc|trines and Duties required in GOD'S Word, in build|ing upon CHRIST as the Foundation. In the &s;a|cred Oracles, we have a compleat Sy&s;tem of what we are to believe and do. And we mu&s;t feel &s;uch a powerful Sen&s;e of the&s;e &s;acred Truths upon our Hearts, as to bring us to re&s;t and rely upon CHRIST, and him only, for Life. And the Hope we have founded upon CHRIST, &s;hould purify our Hearts more and more, and make us fruitful in every good Work, to the Prai&s;e and Glory of GOD. We mu&s;t be &s;tudious to know the Mind and Will of GOD,
<PB N="22" REF="010605_0022_0F80EFDFC93B76E0">
and &s;earch the Scriptures daily, that we may build our Faith upon the Te&s;timony of GOD, and keep his In&s;titutions and Ordinances pure and unmixed, and attend them with Care and Diligence; and never give Way to our own Devices, or be led away by the crafty De&s;igns of tho&s;e who lie in Wait to deceive.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Redemption CHRIST hath purcha&s;ed, mu&s;t be applied unto us by the Holy Spirit, in fix|ing us, &s;avingly, upon the Foundation GOD has laid. It is the Office and Work of the Holy Spirit, in bringing Sinners to Salvation, to apply the Re|demption purcha&s;ed by CHRIST; thereby working Faith in us, and uniting us unto CHRIST, as our Head, and making us Partakers of the&s;e divine In|fluences, by which we are renewed, and &s;anctified, and &s;trengthened in the inner Man; that CHRIST may dwell in our Hearts by Faith; that we being rooted and grounded in Love, may be able to com|prehend with all Saints, what is the Length, and Breadth, and Heighth; and to know the Love of CHRIST, which pa&s;&s;eth Knowledge, that we may be filled with all the Fullne&s;s of GOD, Eph iii. 10. and on. If you han't the Power, nor don't ta&s;te the Fruit of the Spirit, in this great Work of applying the Redemption purcha&s;ed by CHRIST, you can't have any &s;olid Hopes, that you are built on CHRIST, as the &s;ure Foundation, O then, what will become of tho&s;e who deny the Influences and Agency of the holy and ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, in uniting them to CHRIST! they can have no Part in him.</P>

Let me then be&s;eech you, my political Fathers, to &s;ee to it that CHRIST be the Foundation of the Hopes of Salvation. You know the Terms, what you mu&s;t experience in your&s;elves, and what you mu&s;t believe in your Hearts, and what you mu&s;t profe&s;s with your Mouths, if you would be &s;aved. Now, if your Faith and Hope be rightly fixed on CHRIST, the Foundation GOD has laid; then you may know for your Comfort, that <HI>the Foundation of God &s;tandeth &s;ure, having this Seal, the Lord knows

This you will find the be&s;t Support, under the great Burthens of Go|vernment at this Day, which is greatly increa&s;ed by &s;ome peculiar Circum&s;tances; which calls mo&s;t loudly upon you to exert all your Wi&s;dom and Pru|dence, in conducting our public Affairs, to the &s;e|curing our mo&s;t valuable Rights and Privileges, and tran&s;mit them down to our Po&s;terity as a &s;acred Trea&s;ure.</P>

<P>Pray &s;ee that your Laws be well executed, effec|tually to &s;uppre&s;s tho&s;e crying Sins, which have bro't down GOD'S Judgments upon the Land. The Want of the due Execution of the Laws, is one great Occa&s;ion of GOD'S Sabbaths being openly profaned, his Wor&s;hip neglected, and many other Evils prevailing before our Eyes. And the&s;e Things forebode our Ruin, except we be reclaimed by the civil Power.</P>
<P>While you are Guardians to the common Wealth, let me a&s;k your tender Regard for the eccle&s;ia&s;tical Con&s;titution, which has received your Approbation, and is of va&s;t Importance, to the building up of the Kingdom of CHRIST among&s;t us, in the Unity of the Faith, and the Bond of Peace; until we all

<P>I can mo&s;t heartily recommend to your wi&s;e and mo&s;t &s;erious Con&s;ideration, the important Affair of chri&s;tiani&s;ing the poor Heathen in our Land. This is what your Savior ju&s;tly expects from you, at &s;uch a favorable Opportunity as now pre&s;ents. Your Wi&s;dom and Help are needed; and the more you do, to build them up upon the Foundation God has laid, the more you may hope and expect the di|vine Ble&s;&s;ing will attend your pious and wi&s;e Admi|ni&s;tration, for the Good of all under your Care and Government.</P>
<P>I would earne&s;tly be&s;eech you, my political Fa|thers, to make &s;ome more effectual Provi&s;ion for the In&s;truction of our Children, in our common Schools, both in Virtue and good Learning. For that End Schools &s;hould be &s;teadily maintained; and the Teachers &s;hould be qualified Per&s;ons, of good Cha|racters; who will in&s;til the be&s;t Principles into them, by In&s;truction, and a good Example, of Virtue and Religion; and in&s;truct them, by Rule, in tho&s;e Parts of Learning, which are needful, to furni&s;h them for U&s;efulne&s;s in their Day. For that End, perhaps it might be well, if none be &s;uffered to teach in our Schools, but tho&s;e who have been exa|mined

It is then of the greate&s;t Importance, that each One of you per&s;onally partake of Him as your Savior, and experience the powerful Influences of the Holy Spirit, applying the Redemption he has purcha&s;ed, unto you, bringing you &s;everally up to the Terms of the Covenant of Grace; forming the new Creature in your Hearts; implanting tho&s;e divine Principles in your Souls, which will make you pay a due Re&s;pect to Religi|on, in all the Branches of chri&s;tian Duty, both to|wards GOD, the &s;upreme Governor of the World, and all tho&s;e he has &s;et in Authority over you.

O! do all you can to maintain their Honor and Influence among the People; and honor Religion, in your Loyalty to them who rule over you.
