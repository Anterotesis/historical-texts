<Q>And <HI>at what</HI> in&s;tant I &s;hall &s;peak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it: If it do evil in my &s;ight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good wherewith I &s;aid I would benefit them.</Q>

<P>THIS pa&s;&s;age of &s;acred writ is peculiarly adapted to infant &s;tates. From hence, and the two ver&s;es next proceeding, we collect the general rule of the divine allotments towards political combina|tions&mdash;what will, on the one hand, a&s;&s;uredly reco|ver them from the brink of ruin&mdash;what may, on the other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">and, prevent their exaltation when favorable pro&s;pects open upon them.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="016252_0005_0F9BCFE04FCEF388">
THE pre&s;ent hour in the &s;anctuary will accord|ingly be devoted to a &s;ubject, which may at no time hereafter be &s;o &s;ea&s;onable. And the candour of this venerable auditory is relied on, while I offer &s;ome &s;ketches on the providence of GOD in the ri&s;e and fall of empires&mdash;the ve&s;tiges of it encouraging us that the American confederacy may be built up&mdash;the obligations of a people for whom great things have been done, and upon whom &s;uch pro&s;pects are opening&mdash;the danger, in our circum&s;tances, of pre|&s;uming on the &s;miles of heaven, and the quarters from which this danger is to be apprehended.</P>
<P>THE near relation the&s;e things have to the &s;itua|tion of our public affairs will apologize for my not calling your attention &s;o particularly to the origin of government&mdash;the ends of magi&s;tracy&mdash;the cha|racter of a good ruler&mdash;and the duty of &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>FIRST, The governing providence of GOD is pre|&s;uppo&s;ed&mdash;a doctrine clear from the nece&s;&s;ary de|pendence of creatures&mdash;the uniform cour&s;e of na|ture, and &s;pecial interpo&s;itions&mdash;implied in the &s;up|po&s;ition of a revelation. GOD'S government is alike manife&s;t in the natural and moral world. To a Being of infinite perfection all things are alike ea&s;y. It is, moreover, of great moment, that the domini|on of the SOVEREIGN of the univer&s;e be con&s;idered as guided by unerring wi&s;dom, and immutable holi|ne&s;s and goodne&s;s. In this view our &s;ubject repre|&s;ents it. And hence it is equally the object of fear, pious re&s;ignation, filial joy and confidence.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="016252_0006_0F9BCFE119DB27E8">
THIS doctrine, the foundation of natural religion, revealed illu&s;trates. <Q>The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom rul|eth over all. Promotion cometh neither from the ca&s;t, nor from the we&s;t, nor from the &s;outh, but GOD is judge: He pulleth down one, and &s;etteth up another. His <HI>coun&s;el &s;hall &s;tand.</HI></Q> It is in his family, the univer&s;e, as <HI>in a great hou&s;e,</HI> wherein <HI>are ve&s;&s;els not only of gold and &s;ilver; but al&s;o of wood and of earth; and &s;ome to honor, and &s;ome to di&s;honor:</HI>&mdash;Words which, however immediately intended, may be ac|commodated to different orders in a civil communi|ty, and the rank different kingdoms hold among their neighbors. Some are &s;trong, and others weak; &s;ome are above, and others beneath; &s;ome are the head, and others the tail.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2. TIM. ii. 20. DRUT. xxviii. 13.</NOTE></P>
<P>WHATEVER in&s;truments are employed in building and planting kingdoms, the divine hand is to be ul|timately eyed. <HI>All power is of God.</HI> HE rai&s;eth up, as well as removeth, <Q>the mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prudent, the coun&s;ellor, the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator,</Q> who, in different ways, contribute to the exaltation of their people. To HIM are to be a&s;cribed their abilities, the time of their coming on the &s;tage to a&s;&s;ert the rights of their country and mankind, their &s;phere of action, the acceptance of their &s;ervices, and term of their u&s;efullne&s;s. And to whom but HIM, who turneth the hearts of an whole people as the
<PB N="8" REF="016252_0007_0F9BCFE1D3A261E8">
hearts of one man, &s;hall we attribute the union of public bodies? the concurrence and &s;trenuous exer|tions of all ranks for the common &s;afety?</P>
<P>THE &s;ame Being turneth wi&s;e men backward, di|vides public councils, &s;ends civil di&s;cord into king|doms, defeats military enterprizes however well concerted, and fills with terror tho&s;e who &s;eemed to be made without fear. <Q>At thy rebuke, O GOD of Jacob, the &s;tout-hearted are &s;poiled, and none of the men of might find their hands. Thou cutte&s;t off the &s;pirit of princes, and art terrible to the kings of the earth. The wrath of man &s;hall prai&s;e thee; the remainder of wrath &s;hall thou re&s;train.</Q> Good rulers are <HI>his mini&s;ters for good.</HI> Cruel tyrants are <HI>the rod of his anger.</HI> <Q>I have created the wa&s;ter to de&s;troy. The MOST HIGH ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whom&s;oever he will, and SETTETH UP OVER IT THE BASEST OF MEN.</Q></P>
<P>THESE things imply no other divine influence than con&s;i&s;ts with the moral perfections of the DE|ITY and human liberty. <HI>Far be it from</HI> GOD <HI>that he &s;hould do wickedly.</HI></P>
<P>IF it is a&s;ked, Why doth not GOD govern the world without the in&s;trumentality of &s;ubordinate agents? As well might it be a&s;ked, Why did he not determine to &s;ave the world without the inter|vention of a mediator? With re&s;pect to both it &s;hould &s;atisfy us, that <HI>&s;o it &s;eemeth good in his fight.</HI></P>

"AT what in&s;tant I &s;hall &s;peak concerning a na|tion, and concerning a kingdom, to <HI>build</HI> and to <HI>plant</HI> it." From what ve&s;tiges of providence may we infer, that this language comes addre&s;&s;ed to us? It were to be wi&s;hed that this SECOND enquiry could be an&s;wered by referring to the traces of a real re|formation. This would be the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urance of the continuance and enlargement of our liberties. But, O America! <HI>&s;aved of the</HI> LORD, <HI>ha&s;t thou not re|volted more and more?</HI></P>
<P>DIVINE providence doth not precipitate events: There is an harmony in its di&s;tributions. Bodies politic, like the body natural, have their periods of growing to maturity and decay. Some States go to decay &s;ooner than others, as &s;ome per&s;ons ha&s;ten on them&s;elves a premature old age by various exce&s;&s;es. But judging from analogy, is it to be &s;uppo&s;ed, ill-de&s;erving as we are, that the de&s;olation of this coun|try is near? a country re&s;cued more than once in circum&s;tances &s;eemingly de&s;perate. From the ju&s;|tice of our cau&s;e, pa&s;t &s;alvations, and pre&s;ent pro&s;|pects, may we not hope, that for <HI>his own name's &s;ake</HI> the GOD of our fathers will make known his &s;alva|tion in the &s;ight of all nations by humbling our op|pre&s;&s;ors?</P>
<P>WE cannot look into futurity. This is HIS pre|rogative who <HI>&s;eeth the end from the beginning.</HI> But we call to mind his wonders of old. When our ance&s;|tors &s;ought a retreat from oppre&s;&s;ion, he made a path for them through the &s;ea and furni&s;hed them a
<PB N="10" REF="016252_0009_0F9BCFE4D0ECEE78">
table in the wilderne&s;s. When few in number, &s;trangers in the land, and encompa&s;&s;ed by &s;avage enemies&mdash;when help was far off, he drove out the heathen with his hand, increa&s;ed our fathers, and cau&s;ed the fear of them to fall on the enemy. The hand which planted, hath hitherto protected, this vine&mdash;at no time more remarkably, perhaps, than in our own. Events &s;o con&s;picuous, &s;o much be|yond all human fore&s;ight, as tho&s;e we have been witne&s;&s;es to in this war, mu&s;t impre&s;s &s;uch as di&s;re|gard the common cour&s;e of providence. Permit me to mention in this view the debility of the country when the war began&mdash;the &s;teps by which it hath collected &s;trength and firmne&s;s&mdash;the flow progre&s;s of the enemy&mdash;&s;tores taken from them or brought us from abroad&mdash;altogether unexpected internal re|&s;ources (fruits of inventive nece&s;&s;ity)&mdash;the &s;ucce&s;s of our military operations where we le&s;t expected &s;uc|ce&s;s, when and where we were ready to de&s;pair&mdash;the fru&s;tration of them when a &s;pirit of confidence po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed us&mdash;the interference of foreign powers&mdash;the humiliating circum&s;tances to which our potent enemies are reduced. Such a number and variety of marvellous events &s;eldom take place in an age. <HI>Who&s;o is wi&s;e, and will ob&s;erve the&s;e things; even they &s;hall under&s;tand the loving-kindne&s;s of the</HI> LORD.</P>
<P>WE are brought to an AERA as remote from our wi&s;hes, as it was from our expectation, till the pre|&s;ent &s;truggle. We aimed at nothing more than a con&s;titutional connection with Britain. But he who is wonderful in coun&s;el hath &s;poken, (and we cannot
<PB N="11" REF="016252_0010_0F9BCFE597EA8B18">
but <HI>obey his voice</HI>) that we need not <HI>go over the &s;ea</HI> for law. <Q>The MOST HIGH divideth to the nations their inheritance, and &s;eparateth the &s;ons of Adam, de|termining the bounds of their habitation.</Q> His providence, &s;tep by &s;tep, hath called us to a&s;&s;ume an independent rank among the nations. May the new empire, the foundation of which, under the conduct of his over-ruling hand, is already laid, be built up, &s;o as to &s;ecure public liberty to America as long as the &s;un and moon &s;hall endure. May the example <HI>provoke to emulation</HI> the numerous kingdoms, from which arbitrary &s;way hath long &s;ince deforced this ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>THE powers of the human mind are not exerted, or known, till nece&s;&s;ity calls them forth. Like trea|&s;ures hid in the bowels of the earth, unle&s;s &s;ought for, unle&s;s we dig deep, they cannot be found. Thus it is with the abilities and re&s;ources of a coun|try.</P>
<P>A CONFEDERACY between free &s;tates, as the Ame|rican, may have advantages &s;uperior to any civil e&s;|tabli&s;hment. <Q>If a republic is &s;mall, it is de&s;troy|ed by a foreign force; if it be large, it is ruined by an internal imperfection. This twofold in|convenience is remedied by a confederate repub|lic&mdash;a kind of a&s;&s;emblage of &s;ocieties that con&s;titute a new one, capable of increa&s;ing by means of new a&s;&s;ociations. It was the&s;e a&s;&s;ociations that con|tributed &s;o long to the pro&s;perity of GREECE. By the&s;e the ROMANS attacked the univer&s;e; and by
<PB N="12" REF="016252_0011_0F9BCFE651916020">
the&s;e alone the univer&s;e with&s;tood them. For when Rome was arrived to her highe&s;t pitch of grandeur, it was the a&s;&s;ociations behind the Da|nube and the Rhine, a&s;&s;ociations formed by the terror of her arms, that enabled the barbarians to re&s;i&s;t her.</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Spirit of Laws, Vol. I. p. 159, 160.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE American confederacy, from the circum&s;tan|ces of it's formation&mdash;the nece&s;&s;ity impelling to it&mdash;the &s;ituation of the confederate States, with the com|mon intere&s;t European nations will have in protec|ting them&mdash;and the &s;trength it will acquire by im|provements in hu&s;bandry, manufactures and com|merce, new &s;ettlements in the wilderne&s;s, other &s;tates joining the union, &amp;c. bids fair to endure, when the power now armed again&s;t it &s;hall be <HI>broken in pieces</HI>&mdash;When, perhaps, even the remembrance of it &s;hall be <HI>blotted out from under heaven</HI>&mdash;Or this only written for a memorial, that it brought all the horrors of a bloody war on a country which looked up to it as a parent&mdash;that having fir&s;t thru&s;t out her children, the&s;e, taken under the patronage of that Being who is <HI>the refuge of the oppre&s;&s;ed,</HI> who&s;e is <HI>the earth and the fullne&s;s thereof,</HI> derived from him, and him only, a goodly heritage&mdash;that their unnatural parent wan|tonly claimed the fruit of their unparrelleled toil and perils, and attempted by famine, fire and &s;word to compell them to &s;urrender it; but failing in the un|dertaking, precipitated her own ruin.</P>

<P>GOD &s;peaks to men in his word and providence as clearly as when he uttered his voice from the ex|cellent glory. When we view him as the FATHER <HI>of the whole family in heaven and earth&mdash;making his &s;un to ri&s;e on the evil and good, and &s;ending rain on the ju&s;t and unju&s;t&mdash;exerci&s;ing loving kindne&s;s, judgment, and righ|teou&s;ne&s;s in the earth&mdash;reconciling the world to him&s;elf in</HI> JESUS CHRIST&mdash;<HI>leading</HI> &s;inners <HI>to repentance by the riches of his goodne&s;s and forbearance;</HI> but <HI>whetting his &s;word,</HI> and <HI>taking hold on judgment,</HI> if the degenerate <HI>turn not</HI>&mdash;When we reflect further, that the love of GOD and our neighbour is <HI>more than whole burnt offer|ings and &s;acrifices</HI>&mdash;that <HI>faith working by love</HI> is the &s;um of chri&s;tianity&mdash;that <HI>the kingdom of</HI> GOD <HI>is righteou&s;|ne&s;s, and peace, and joy in the</HI> HOLY GHOST&mdash;We are hence &s;ufficiently informed what it is to <HI>hearken unto</HI> GOD, <HI>to obey his voice.</HI></P>
<P>THE love of GOD is <HI>the fir&s;t and great commandment;</HI> the love of our neighbor <HI>the &s;econd,</HI> and like unto it. Such is the &s;imilarity and connection between the&s;e two commandments, that <Q>he who loveth not his brother, whom he hath &s;een, cannot love GOD,

whom he hath not &s;een.</Q> The exhortation, <HI>Look not every man on his own things, but every man al&s;o on the things of others,</HI> could not have been enforced by an argument of comparable weight with that the apo&s;tle &s;ubjoins; <HI>Let this mind be in you, which was in</HI> CHRIST JESUS. The &s;trength and extent of this divine principle were di&s;played in him beyond all example. He <HI>went about doing good;</HI> and, having humbled him&s;elf from the form of GOD to that of a &s;ervant, in the likene&s;s of men, <HI>gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all.</HI> His religion is better adapted to promote the welfare of &s;ociety, by making it's members what they ought to be, than all the maxims and in&s;titu|tions of the wi&s;e&s;t philo&s;ophers and legi&s;lators. Can the rejection of &s;uch a religion con&s;i&s;t with a public &s;pirit?

But however qua|lified they may be in other re&s;pects to &s;erve their country, nothing could more fully prove them ene|mies of it, than their vilifying a religion admirably adapted to promote peace and mutual good will; inculcating tho&s;e public affections which build up a commonwealth, render it <HI>as a city compact together,</HI> and to it's enemies <HI>terrible as an army with banners.</HI> May we never &s;ee the time in this Chri&s;tian State, when the contemners of a religion &s;o beneficial to communities &s;hall be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of public tru&s;t. This would be to advance men who publicly in&s;ult their <HI>country, and the cities of our</HI> GOD; who pour obloquy on the bright|e&s;t character that ever appeared in human form, the friend of all mankind, GOD <HI>manife&s;t in the fle&s;h</HI></P>

<P>WHETHER civil or religious u&s;urpation hath been greate&s;t, is difficult to &s;ay.

A better rea&s;on cannot, probably be given for the late e&s;tabli&s;hment of popery by a Briti&s;h par|liament, while the prote&s;tant religion, founded in principles of liberty, is barely tolerated. Popery can prevail only under an arbitrary government, implying a general ignorance of civil rights. Hence the pre&s;ervation of our religion depends on the con|tinuance of a free government. Let our allies have their eyes opened on the ble&s;&s;ings of &s;uch a go|vernment, and they will at once renounce their &s;u|per&s;tition.

It con&s;i&s;ted of twelve di&s;tinct &s;tates; each &s;overeign in the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice within it&s;elf, while their councils and force were united in whatever concerned them all. Their con&s;titution was mo&s;t friendly to public liberty. For be&s;ides the inde|pendence of the re&s;pective &s;tates on each other, and their confederacy as one kingdom for the better &s;e|curity of their common and particular rights, in this divinely in&s;tituted polity public tru&s;ts were not hereditary, nor had they any revenue to &s;upport the officers of government in affluence. Equality of condition was provided for, and the means of cor|ruption prevented, by the agrarian law, prohibiti|on of money on u&s;ury, relea&s;e of &s;ervants and deb|tors, and return of e&s;tates in the jubilee. That they might pre&s;erve their liberties inviolate, they were in&s;tructed to remember their bondage in Egypt, and wonderful deliverance&mdash;the pre&s;ervation of their liberties in all times of danger by the manife&s;t interpo&s;ition of the Almighty in humbling tyrants for their &s;akes.</P>

<P>FROM the natural parity of mankind it clearly follows, that all &s;overeignty is ultimately in the people, or their repre&s;entatives. They may, at any time, regulate the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, limit the &s;overeign, or aboli&s;h kingly government. Different forms of government are adapted to different people and cir|cum&s;tances. The only view in which one form is preferable to another, is, the greater pro&s;pect of an impartial admini&s;tration under it. For this rea&s;on we give the preference to a repre&s;entative democra|cy. We may be prejudiced by education. Our pre&s;ent &s;ufferings from an oppre&s;&s;ive power may have &s;trengthned tho&s;e prejudices. But all hi&s;tory a&s;&s;ures us, that when the powers of government have been lodged with a &s;ingle per&s;on the care of the public has not been the object of pur&s;uit. He has been content with mea&s;ures that will la&s;t out his own time. Or if his views have extended fur|ther, it has been to compleat a &s;y&s;tem of tyranny. Nor hath it been otherwi&s;e, when the deci&s;ion of all affairs has been engro&s;&s;ed by a few, and the&s;e not dependent on their people. But in the form we &s;peak of, a &s;pirit of love and union is promoted by mediocrity of circum&s;tances&mdash;a &s;pirit of envy and
<PB N="20" REF="016252_0019_0F9BCFEDE00B79D8">
jealou&s;y is prevented. Public employments are not lucrative&mdash;they require application they are tran&s;|ferrable. Here merit is more generally di&s;tingui&s;h|ed. Every individual con&s;iders him&s;elf, and is re|garded by the community, as a per&s;on of &s;ome &s;ig|nificance. The lowe&s;t have free acce&s;s to the chief magi&s;trate. Such a form of government is an ef|fectual cheek to that in&s;upportable pride and bound|le&s;s ambition, which have &s;lain millions. People are better &s;atisfied with public mea&s;ures when their rulers have a common intere&s;t with them, and are led by their connections, attachments, and a &s;en&s;e of dependence to care for the &s;tate. Popular di&s;con|tent will take place on &s;ome occa&s;ions. But if groundle&s;s, it is &s;oon appea&s;ed by the timely inter|po&s;ition of &s;ome wi&s;e and prudent per&s;on. If well founded, the people know their rulers are ready to hear their complaints&mdash;will admit a conviction of any mi&s;takes, and, upon conviction, rectify them. Or if they per&s;i&s;t in mea&s;ures hurtful to the com|munity, they can be di&s;placed. However a popu|lar government has been reproached, it will be found on enquiry le&s;s &s;ubject to threatning in&s;ur|rections than the other forms.</P>
<P>ONE &s;uch government at lea&s;t may be named, in which in&s;urrections have rarely taken place, and never proceeded to any de&s;perate lengths. Were there any &s;uch thing on earth, the government re|ferred to might be propo&s;ed as a model of a perfect commonwealth. It is indeed a &s;ingular example. The legi&s;lative body have from the beginning done
<PB N="21" REF="016252_0020_0F9BCFEEA1511550">
the highe&s;t honour to popular elections, and &s;hewn the entire &s;afety and wi&s;dom of an annual choice. There can be no danger from frequent elections, while tho&s;e in authority are tender of the rights of the community. When they are not &s;o, ought elec|tions to return but &s;eldom to &s;ecure them in place? In the commonwealth I &s;peak of, a generous con|cern for the public liberties in the legi&s;lature, and re&s;pect for authority in the people, have happily united. It's exertions on all public occa&s;ions, in the pre&s;ent war e&s;pecially, have placed in a con|vincing light the advantages of a repre&s;entative de|mocracy. We tru&s;t there will never be occa&s;ion to &s;ay, that it's order and happine&s;s hitherto have not been owing to the &s;pirit of liberty and parity of circum&s;tances, but to the <HI>check</HI> it has been under from Britain. If it's own wi&s;dom and virtue had not heretofore, as well as more lately, guarded it's rights, that check, in&s;tead of defending, would have abridged them. The checks of a monarchy or an ari&s;tocracy have not general happine&s;s for their ob|ject: For they both depend on great inequality in a community. They pur&s;ue the intere&s;ts of a few by the mi&s;ery of many.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Perhaps no amendment can be propo&s;ed in the pre&s;ent civil polity of Connecticut but what would be attended with greater <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;que than pro&s;pect of advantage.

<P><PB N="22" REF="016252_0021_0F9BCFEF579C1528">
THERE may, we grant, be equality in the ex|treme. The &s;pirit of liberty, con&s;i&s;ting in <HI>every man's doing what is right in his own eyes,</HI> is the de&s;truction of public happine&s;s, and of &s;ociety it&s;elf. Com|plaints may be indulged without rea&s;on. It is true, notwith&s;tanding, that the body of a people much oftner acquie&s;ce in wrong mea&s;ures, and bear bur|thens which cannot righteou&s;ly be laid upon them, than complain without rea&s;on.</P>
<P><Q>BUT the dignity of government &s;hould be maintained.</Q> True. They who watch for the public weal are entitled to e&s;teem and an honorable &s;upport. <HI>De&s;pi&s;ers of government</HI> are dangerous men in any &s;tate. There is, however, a difference be|tween good government and bad. Nor is the dig|nity of government to be maintained by relinqui&s;h|ing, on demand, immunities conferred on us by the GOD of nature and grace, recognized by the laws of &s;ociety, and which we are commanded by the highe&s;t authority to &s;tand fa&s;t in. The dignity of government depends not le&s;s on the wi&s;dom and ju&s;|tice of it's admini&s;tration, than on the reverence and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the governed.</P>
<P>AMONG the various cau&s;es which have brought &s;lavery on a free people, a lavi&s;h di&s;tribution of the public trea&s;ure hath not been the lea&s;t. Hence ru|lers have ri&s;en to independence, and &s;ubverted the liberties they were appointed to defend. In&s;tead of making the public burthens lighter, they have in|crea&s;ed them. The body of mankind ri&s;e up early,
<PB N="23" REF="016252_0022_0F9BCFF011AA6E30">
and &s;it up late, to toil for a &s;canty &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; while the greater part of their earnings is con&s;umed on the pride and vanity, the &s;loth di&s;&s;ipation and luxury of a few. Behold the tears of the oppre&s;&s;ed in various parts of the earth. They cry out of vi|olence and wrong without redre&s;s&mdash;<HI>Redre&s;s,</HI> did I &s;ay! Even a groan in their bondage is deemed in|&s;olent, and not uttered but at the hazard of life. An opulent magi&s;tracy have proved the bane of the &s;tate, as an opulent clergy have of the church.</P>
<P>WHILE ju&s;tice con&s;trains me to &s;ay this, it equal|ly requires a caution again&s;t a &s;pirit of impatience and in&s;olence under the admini&s;tration of rulers who <HI>&s;eek the wealth of their people.</HI> Their vigilance, their unwearied attempts for their country, e&s;pecially at a time when it's liberties are in imminent danger, demand the warme&s;t acknowledgments and ready concurrence of the community. Gratitude and in|tere&s;t oblige a people to &s;ay, <HI>We will be with you; be of good courage, and do it.</HI> Government may lo&s;e the re&s;pect it claims by an ill judged par&s;imony. Hence the fir&s;t places in it may be filled by men of low talents, or no fixed principles.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t &s;ecurity of any government is the love of it diffu&s;ed through all ranks. In order to this <HI>lenity</HI> mu&s;t be it's characteri&s;tic. Wide is the dif|ference between an ea&s;tern DESPOT, like <HI>a roaring lion and ranging bear over a poor people;</HI> and a ruler who is the FATHER of his &s;ubjects <HI>&s;cattering the wicked with his eyes,</HI> in who&s;e <HI>days the righteous flouri&s;h. When

the ear heareth him, it ble&s;&s;eth him; and when the eye &s;eeth him, it gives witne&s;s to him.</HI> In conducting a &s;tate, as in a family, &s;everity may procure a forced &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion for a time; but, on the whole, renders authority weak and precarious. Hence many and rigorous penal laws are to be avoided. They de|&s;troy the di&s;tinction of crimes&mdash;eradicate the princi|ples of ingenuity and &s;hame&mdash;beget a &s;lavi&s;h &s;pirit&mdash;and mu&s;t end in anarchy or de&s;poti&s;m. Multi|plying penal laws, like that of oaths, de&s;troys the force of them. Lenity is peculiarly the character of the divine government. The &s;upreme ruler of the world <HI>delighteth in mercy.</HI> Puni&s;hment is his <HI>&s;trange work.</HI> Now the nearer any human go|vernment is conformed to this pattern, the more perfect.</P>
<P>WE go on to &s;ay, &s;implicity of manners condu|ces to build a &s;tate. Such a people are, for the mo&s;t part, active, hardy and brave&mdash;jealous of their rights&mdash;united in their councils&mdash;fruitful in re&s;our|ces&mdash;fixed in their purpo&s;e, unawed by the threats or ravages of tyrants: Yea, the&s;e rou&s;e them to greater exploits.</P>
<P>THE principal riches of a &s;tate con&s;i&s;t in the fruits of the field. Special attention is therefore due to the condition of the hu&s;bandman.</P>

facilitated by inviting indu&s;trious and virtuous fo|reigners to &s;ettle among us.</P>
<P>FINALLY: A government which gives due en|couragement to &s;chools and public wor&s;hip hath every way the advantage of one that neglects them, in regard of civil order and happine&s;s. This is ea&s;ily &s;een from comparing them together. An early cul|ture in human knowledge, and in&s;truction in reli|gion, are important objects&mdash;a like nece&s;&s;ary to build up a people. The immediate civil advantages of them, regard to po&s;terity, and to the SOVEREIGN of the univer&s;e, who di&s;pen&s;eth to communities in this world according to their character, enforce them upon us. The oath of GOD can no longer be the bond of &s;ociety, than the public acknowledgment of him is upheld. It is given as part of the cha|racter of one of the be&s;t rulers, that he <HI>&s;pake com|fortably to all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the</HI> LORD. If the mini&s;ters of religion invade the province of the magi&s;trate, or a&s;&s;ume dominion over the faith of chri&s;tians, or are needle&s;ly involved in &s;ecular affairs, or lead a life of idlene&s;s, di&s;&s;ipation and &s;en&s;uality, let them be de&s;pi&s;ed. If the go&s;pel hath an unfriendly a&s;pect on civil &s;ociety&mdash;or if any individual can be injured in his chri&s;tian liberty by being required to uphold it in &s;uch public form as he &s;hall chu&s;e, then let the LORD'S-day, and the in|&s;titutions of religion be neglected. But if the con|trary is the obvious truth, a good magi&s;trate will then take care of religion, that the &s;tate may be in health and pro&s;per. <HI>Them that honor me, I
