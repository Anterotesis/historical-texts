<HEAD>A <HI>SERMON,</HI> &amp;c. THE very remarkable Aera, which this Day opens upon us, and the manner of our coming together &s;ugge&s;ted to my mind the following pa&s;&s;age from the &s;acred Scriptures, which may a&s;&s;i&s;t us to a profitable improvement of &s;o uncommon a Revolution.</HEAD>

<Q><BIBL><HI>DEUTERONOMY, XXIX.10.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Ye &s;tand this Day, all of you, before the Lord your <HI>GOD;</HI> your Captains of your Tribes; your Elders, and your Officers, with all the Men of I&s;rael.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE tribes of I&s;rael, to whom the words ju&s;t read were originally addre&s;&s;ed, were a&s;&s;embled together, by the expre&s;s command of GOD, to hear their prophet recapitulate the many and
<PB N="6" REF="018658_0005_0FA80A6279550C38">
&s;ignal ble&s;&s;ings, which a kind Providence had conferred upon them; that the recollection might warm their hearts with gratitude; and di&s;po&s;e them with the greater cheerfulne&s;s, and &s;tricter &s;incerity, to devote them&s;elves to the &s;ervice of their divine Benefactor.</P>
<P>HE begins with the awful di&s;plays of divine power upon their oppre&s;|&s;ors, upon Pharaoh and his people; that all the nations around might be convinced, that GOD had a gracious care for his cho&s;en people, and that his people might have their minds e&s;tabli&s;hed in full confidence, in the power and good|ne&s;s of that Providence they had put them&s;elves under.&mdash;He mentions the &s;urpri&s;ing manner in which they had been &s;upported.&mdash;"<HI>Ye have not eaten Bread, nor drank Wine,"&mdash;" And your cloaths waxed not old upon you.</HI>"</P>
<P>AND when the Kings of the country were &s;o regardle&s;s of that divine prohibi|tion,
<PB N="7" REF="018658_0006_0FA80A63152B01A0">
which &s;aid, <HI>touch not my people,</HI> as to oppo&s;e them with their armies, they were de&s;troyed, and their land divided among the conquerors for an inheritance.</P>
<P>THESE were Rea&s;ons calculated to impre&s;s their minds with a la&s;ting &s;en&s;e of divine goodne&s;s, and that they might attend to them; they were called off from their &s;ecular employments, to &s;tand, all of them, before the Lord.&mdash;</P>
<P>From which we may infer,</P>
<P>THAT there are certain occa&s;ions peculiarly proper for looking back upon the various dealings of providence towards a people. And that the mo&s;t rational and &s;criptural way is, for a People to a&s;&s;emble them&s;elves together, that they may jointly con&s;ider and improve the ways of providence.</P>
<P>THERE are certain occa&s;ions peculiarly proper for recollecting the dealings
<PB N="8" REF="018658_0007_0FA80A64F3473668">
of providence towards a particular People.</P>
<P>WHEN the divine Being hath been plea&s;ed to di&s;play his wi&s;dom, power and goodne&s;s, he expects to receive declarative glory from his rational offspring:&mdash; That mercies &s;hould be acknowledged and rejoiced in.&mdash;It was the aggravated &s;in of I&s;rael, <HI>not to con&s;ider</HI> the dealings of GOD with them; and it is injoined with peculiar force&mdash;"That <HI>they remember the work of the Lord, that they meditate on all his works, and talk of his doings.</HI>" And this was ever the practice of the mo&s;t eminent characters mentioned in holy writ.&mdash;When Noah had experienced the &s;ignal care of Heaven, in the pre&s;ervation of him&s;elf and family from the univer&s;al deluge, the fir&s;t thought of his heart was gratitude; and the fir&s;t work of his hand was, to erect a memorial of the divine favour.&mdash;When Abraham had
<PB N="9" REF="018658_0008_0FA80A655703C8E0">
given proof of his faith; and the life of his &s;on was &s;pared, he perpetuated his &s;en&s;e of the divine goodne&s;s, calling the name of that place <HI>Jehovah-jireh.</HI>&mdash; So, when the nation of I&s;rael was re&s;cued from the cruel bondage of Aegypt, they were expre&s;&s;ly commanded to keep that day for a memorial of the goodne&s;s of GOD, forever. I might go on to mention the examples of David, of Jo&s;hua and of Solomon, in &s;hort, of religious per&s;ons in every age and nation.</P>
<P>BUT I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that rea&s;on and the &s;acred Scriptures, teach us to acknowledge public favours, in a &s;ocial and public way. Many individuals uniting together con&s;titute a community; therefore expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude for common ble&s;&s;ings, mu&s;t come from a collective body. And it was the manner in which the ancient church of GOD acknowledged the &s;pecial favours of Heaven.&mdash;It was their method, <HI>to go up
<PB N="10" REF="018658_0009_0FA80A665693ADA8">
to the hou&s;e of</HI> GOD, to declare that the Lord had done great things for them.&mdash; When they had been miraculou&s;ly delivered from &s;ervitude, and in a wonderful manner led to the land of Canaan;&mdash;the language of every pious heart was, come let us go up to the hou&s;e of the Lord, and acknowledge all his wonderful works, and &s;hew forth his prai&s;e.</P>
<P>AND, when the nation of I&s;rael was under the immediate government of GOD, he was plea&s;ed frequently to a&s;&s;emble them together, to acknowledge the mercies they received.</P>
<P>AND when Mo&s;es drew nigh the clo&s;e of his life, &s;till de&s;irous of the good of the people over&punc; whom he had &s;o long pre&s;ided, he calls the tribes of I&s;rael together before the Lord, to hear him relate the remarkable providences of GOD in their favour; becau&s;e this was the mo&s;t
<PB N="11" REF="018658_0010_0FA80A66D26A3FA8">
probable method of fixing a grateful remembrance of divine favours upon their minds.</P>
<P>FROM &s;uch motives as the&s;e we are this day, <HI>all of us,</HI> a&s;&s;embled before the Lord our GOD, our captains of our tribes, our elders and our officers, with all the men of our community, that we may recapitulate the goodne&s;s of providence towards this church and town, by tracing the hi&s;tory of our fir&s;t &s;ettlement, our growth and e&s;tabli&s;hment of our pre&s;ent pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>HERE it may be proper ju&s;t to ob&s;erve, that the noble&s;t motives the human heart is capable of, influenced the fir&s;t adventurers to America. "After the chri&s;tian religion had flouri&s;hed in &s;implicity and purity, for many ages; de&s;igning men marred its beauty with impure doctrines, turning a&s;ide after the vi&s;ionary phantoms of enthu&s;ia&s;m and
<PB N="12" REF="018658_0011_0FA80A67865F4D48">
bigotry.&mdash;When by far, the greate&s;t part of the chri&s;tian world, lay under the delu&s;ion of popi&s;h errors, 'till the begin|ing of the 16th century, when the glorious reformation began in Germany, and &s;oon extended its benign influences to the inhabitants of Great-Britain. But the great enemy of human happine&s;s, &s;tirred up a &s;pirit of pride and ambition in the reformed church of England, &s;o that men of tender con&s;ciences &s;uffered grievous trials, 'till our ance&s;tors, who for the &s;trictne&s;s of their manners were called puritans;&mdash;unable, any longer, to &s;ubmit to the unrea&s;onable demands of the church of England, con&s;ulted together, and concluded to fly to &s;ome land of liberty and peace.</P>
<P>ANIMATED by &s;uch motives, they cheerfully relinqui&s;hed their attachment to their native country, the &s;weets of tranquil life, and, with re&s;pect to many, they gave up affluent e&s;tates for the hope
<PB N="13" REF="018658_0012_0FA80A684AB66E80">
of enjoying the liberty of wor&s;hiping GOD in peace, in the manner their con&s;ciences approved.&mdash;Sweetned with the plea&s;ing expectation of leaving the fair inheritance to their children and their children's children; and about one hundred and &s;ixty years ago, fir&s;t landed on this American &s;hore.</P>
<P>MANY and great embarra&s;&s;ments attended the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of Plymouth colony, &s;o as to prevent the planting of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts for about half a &s;core years.</P>
<P>BUT the noble motives which enabled them to undertake, &s;till animated them to go through the labours and dangers they met with, and mu&s;t needs expect to meet, in &s;o great an undertaking;&mdash; they overcame difficulties, by daring to encounter them, &s;o that the &s;ettlement &s;pread to Charle&s;town, Salem, Bo&s;ton, and other places. Large tracts of
<PB N="14" REF="018658_0013_0FA80A690E55E048">
inteterval and medow, promi&s;ed a more immediate &s;upport, and invited our ance&s;tors to inland places, that within twenty years after the fir&s;t planting this colony, the towns immediately around us, were taken up; and about one hundred and thirty years ago, two adventurers from Charle&s;town&mdash;Me&s;&s;i'rs Kettle and Boon with their families, &s;ettled upon lands they had purcha&s;ed of the natives, which land is known by their names to this day; but in the year 1675, the tribes of Pawkamauket, Uncompan, Wotolaom and Samkana, with Phillip at their head, were defeated by governor Win&s;low, and obliged to leave their country, &s;cattered among the Monhegins, Pequods, Nipnetts and Na&s;hawas, whom they per&s;uaded to join with them in a&s;&s;aulting Lanca&s;ter, Sudbury and Medfield, leaving the ve&s;tiges of their cruelty behind them: This &s;o alarmed our two defencele&s;s &s;ettlers, as to induce them to remove
<PB N="15" REF="018658_0014_0FA80A69CBF825E0">
with their families; but unhappy Boon, in attempting to remove his hou&s;hold goods, was ambu&s;hed and murdered, by the Indians.</P>
<P>THE affairs of this village, as it was then called, were managed by a committee under the appointment of the general court until their incorporation; when the inhabitants of Pomp&s;iticutt elected their fir&s;t town officers, in the month of April, 1683, Sergeant Benjamin Bozworth, Thomas Stevens, Stephen Hall, Boaz Brown and Jo&s;eph Free|man, &s;elect-men;&mdash;Thomas Gates, con&s;table.</P>
<P>BUT the &s;pring following, 12 adven|turers from Bo&s;ton, Watertown and Concord, as proprietors of Pomp&s;iticutt, petitioned the general court, to be incorporated into a town by the name of STOW, which petition was granted on the 16th of May, 1683.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="018658_0015_0FA80A6A86847500">SOME of the&s;e original proprietors have numerous de&s;cendants, who &s;upport their names with reputation to this day, though many of them have not even their names remaining with us.</P>
<P>AGREEABLE to the principles of their ance&s;tors, their fir&s;t concern was to enjoy the public wor&s;hip of GOD. In 1686, they con&s;i&s;ted of 37 rateable polls, to &s;upport the expence of building a meeting-hou&s;e for divine wor&s;hip, and a man&s;ion-hou&s;e for a mini&s;ter.&mdash;They had a con&s;iderable number who preached with them for &s;hort terms. In 1682, one Mr. Green, and in 1685, Mr. Harris, then Mr. James Minot from Concord, whom they about two years after invited to &s;ettle in the mini&s;try with them, but &s;ucceeded not.&mdash;But in 1686, the records mention the great affection of the town towards one Mr. William Woodroffe, in choo&s;ing a committee to give Mr. Woodroffe, a &s;olemen invitation to come
<PB N="17" REF="018658_0016_0FA80A6B6B6F8D78">
preach and &s;ettle with them in the work of the go&s;pel, but &s;ucceeded not.&mdash;Mr. Overton, in 1689, then Mr. Jonathan Winborn, mini&s;tered to them &s;ix years. After him Mr. Mor&s;e and Mr. Wood|ward from Dedham, &s;upplied them for two or three years&mdash;'till the year 1699, when the Rev. Mr. John Eveleth, recieved an invitation, and the next year was ordained the fir&s;t mini&s;ter of the church of Chri&s;t in Stow, who continued &s;eventeen years.&mdash;The church then applyed to Mr. Sparhawk and Mr. John Gardner, the la&s;t of whom received an invitation from the church and town in the month of April, and on the 18th of November following, was ordained to the work of the go&s;pel mini&s;try, and continued his labour with great faithful|ne&s;s, for above half a century, died on the 10th of January, 1774; and on the 11th of October, 1775, the preacher was ordained in colleague&s;hip with the Rev. Mr. Gardner.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="018658_0017_0FA80A6E828EB190">BUT to return to the civil affairs of the town; the fir&s;t meeting-hou&s;e being decayed in June, 1713, they built their &s;econd hou&s;e for divine wor&s;hip, about a quarter of a mile ea&s;t from the pre&s;ent hou&s;e.&mdash;But in about 40 years, the number of inhabitants was &s;o increa&s;ed, and the &s;ituation of the meeting not convenient, they erected their third hou&s;e on the 27th of Augu&s;t, 1752; at which time the town con&s;i&s;ted of 118 families, i. e. 260 &s;ouls, which was an increa&s;e of 88 families in about half a century; and in 1776, which is 24 years, there was an increa&s;e of 220 &s;ouls.&mdash;And in the year 1783, the number of inhabitants had increa&s;ed to 935, which is 95 in 7 years, be&s;ides about one hundred that have been taken away by death in that time.&mdash; And on the 25th of February la&s;t, 154 from us were incorporated into the di&s;trict of Boxborough.</P>
<P>DURING the mini&s;try of the Rev. Mr. Gardner, 209 communicants were
<PB N="19" REF="018658_0018_0FA80A7001582978">
admitted to the Lord's Table.&mdash;Our pre&s;ent communion con&s;i&s;ts of 108.&mdash; 1346 received the ordinance of bapti&s;m, from January, 1719, until October, 1774; and from 1774, to this time, 260, which amounts to 1606 that have been baptized in this church.</P>
<P>THESE are the mo&s;t material facts that re&s;pect the &s;ettlement and pro&s;perity of this town&mdash;unle&s;s it is the very di&s;tin|gui&s;hing care of providence for its inhabitants.&mdash;For while the inhabitants of other towns have been carried into the mo&s;t cruel captivity, or &s;lain in the field of battle, we have been protected in the mid&s;t of equal dangers, both in the for|mer and in the late bloody wars, that not an individual has fallen by the enemy.</P>
<P>SO have we been exempted from the &s;pecial calamities of the pre&s;ent war. If we turn our eyes to the field, where the barbarous Britons &s;pread their encamp|ments,
<PB N="20" REF="018658_0019_0FA80A718EA35850">
rioting in the &s;poils of the indu&s;trious, indi&s;criminately plundering the rich and the poor, the widow and the orphan; there we &s;hall behold mo&s;t &s;orrowful families, bereaved parents, di&s;con&s;olate widows, and weeping orphans. How many bleeding bo&s;oms call for our compa&s;&s;ion!&mdash;What afflicted multitudes, deprived of their once plea&s;ant dwellings and the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence&mdash;the ruins of beautiful hou&s;es in their &s;peechle&s;s but flaming oratory, implore the &s;ympa|thetic tear from every eye!&mdash;How many virtuous and re&s;pectable families, &s;poiled of their &s;ub&s;tance and driven from their once peaceful abodes, to &s;eek a refuge among &s;trangers&mdash;and in many places the temples of the holy GOD, where the glad tidings of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, had been &s;tatedly di&s;pen&s;ed to &s;erious and dovout wor&s;hippers, have been &s;acrificed to the wantonne&s;s of barbarity, or made receptacles of idle and profane &s;ports; while we have dwelt in &s;afety, and
<PB N="21" REF="018658_0020_0FA80A720AA386A8">
enjoyed our &s;abbaths in peace, have had the advantage of that religion, which is be&s;t calculated to make its profe&s;&s;ors rationally and &s;ub&s;tantially good&mdash;where wi&s;dom and beauty di&s;play their charms in the devotion of &s;incere wor&s;hippers.</P>
<P>AND it is with heart-felt joy, I can this day congratulate you, not only that your per&s;ons and property are &s;ecure from the de&s;olations of war; but that peace is re&s;tored to our bleeding land. Tidings grateful to our ears, as cooling waters to the thir&s;ty &s;oul.&mdash;Let us then con&s;ecrate the gladne&s;s of our hearts to GOD, who has graciou&s;ly heard our prayers, and granted our de&s;ires&mdash;given us in &s;ecurity to enjoy the rewards of indu&s;try&mdash;"<HI>terque quaterque foelices</HI>;" happy people if we are but &s;en&s;ible of our privileges. The pre&s;ent &s;tate of this town is an evidence of the care of a good providence over the virtuous.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="018658_0021_0FA80A72CEBB4D20">THESE places, which one century ago, were the dark and inho&s;pitable abodes of bea&s;ts of prey or more cruel &s;avages, now pre&s;ent to the eye beautiful land&s;kips of exten&s;ive and well cultivated fields; which with &s;miling and exuberant eloquence prai&s;e the indu&s;trious labourer, and give glory to the great Lord of all.</P>
<P>HAPPY in the regularity of our internal police for many years pa&s;t, gratitude obliges us to acknowledge the prudent and benevolent &s;ervices of a GARDNER<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Hon.
