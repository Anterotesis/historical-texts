<P>WHEN the fir&s;t parents of mankind had violated the covenant of their God, all their plea&s;ing pro&s;pects were de&s;troyed. Futu|rity, to them, was wrapt in impenetrable darkne&s;s. Con&s;cious guilt and terrifying expectations filled their minds, while they waited, nor waited long, the awful deci&s;ion of their offended Sovereign.</P>
<P>IT is not rational to &s;uppo&s;e, that they could even conjecture any &s;cheme, which promi&s;ed the lea&s;t hope of e&s;cape from the threatened puni&s;hment
<PB REF="024747_0004_0FC86845874E1248">
to di&s;obedience. Confu&s;ed with guilt, &s;hame and terror, they attempted, but in vain, <HI>to hide from the pre&s;ence of the Lord.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. iii.8.</NOTE></P>
<P>HITHERTO divine goodne&s;s reigned toward man. Divine mercy, now needed, began to dawn, and thenceforth &s;hown brighter and brighter <HI>to the perfect day</HI> of revealed truth. <HI>Then</HI> came go&s;pel grace to the condemned, through a Redeemer. Then was <HI>fir&s;t</HI> made known the promi&s;ory declara|tion of the eternal God, that <HI>the &s;eed of the woman &s;hould brui&s;e the &s;erpent's head.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 15.</NOTE></P>
<P>IF upon the lap&s;e of man, the Almighty had have forthwith deprived the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of the light of life, and there have ended for ever the hu|man race, it would have been perfectly ju&s;t. But mercy &s;u&s;pended ju&s;tice; in the di&s;play of which, God &s;aid to man, Live, <HI>I have found a ran&s;om.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Job xxxiii.24. comp. 1 Tim. ii.9,</NOTE> While the angel of ju&s;tice guarded <HI>the tree of life,</HI> by which man's life was to have been perpetuated, the angel of mercy, if I may &s;o &s;peak, pointed to ano|ther and better <HI>tree of life,</HI> even Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who, for man, <HI>hath brought life and immortality to light.</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. i.10.</NOTE></P>
<P>IN this glorious &s;cheme of redemption, all the perfections of Deity harmonize. It continues the human race, which without it mu&s;t have been ex|tinct, puts man into a &s;alvable &s;tate, under a new covenant of grace; according to which, &s;in is de|&s;ervedly puni&s;hed, and God can <HI>be ju&s;t, and the ju&s;tifier of the &s;inner which believeth in Je&s;us.</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii.26.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="024747_0005_0FC86847C18177B0">THIS admirable plan of grace and &s;alvation to man, was gradually opened from the fir&s;t promi&s;e to <HI>the fulne&s;s of time.</HI> Then Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> the light and life of the world, a|ro&s;e with divine &s;plendor, and mightily di&s;pelled the clouds of ignorance, error and uncertainty which darkened the moral world. In <HI>this</HI> plan, as revealed in the &s;criptures, is contained the will of God to man. According to this, we are to learn what God is, and what we &s;hould be. To know and conform to the will of God thus made known, is the fir&s;t duty and highe&s;t happine&s;s of man. It is his proper &s;tudy, and &s;hould be his &s;upreme concern.</P>
<P>LET it be our endeavour, my hearers, to &s;earch the will of God to men, not only in tho&s;e things which <HI>have been,</HI> and <HI>now are,</HI> but <HI>tho&s;e</HI> al&s;o which <HI>&s;hall be</HI> made plain by accompli&s;hment. Not indeed with vain curio&s;ity, nor the pre&s;umptuous thought of <HI>&s;earching out the Almighty to perfection,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job xi.7.</NOTE> but, that we may &s;ee more rea&s;on, and be more excited to believe and obey, to adore and prai&s;e with increa&s;ed fervency and firmne&s;s.</P>
<P>WITH &s;uch views, let us attend to the will of God expre&s;&s;ed in our text. It is a prophetic di&s;|cour&s;e of I&s;aiah re&s;pecting the purity, enlargement and glory of the church of God. In the whole chapter, the prophet evidently looks forward to go&s;pel times, and &s;eems in one pa&s;&s;age, to extend
<PB N="8" REF="024747_0006_0FC8684AEFDD9DC8">
his views to the permanent ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of the church triumphant. He begins the chapter with great animation. <HI>Ari&s;e, &s;hine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is ri&s;en upon thee. For behold, the darkne&s;s &s;hall cover the earth, and gro&s;s darkne&s;s the people; but the Lord &s;hall ari&s;e upon thee, and his glory &s;hall be &s;een upon thee. And the Gentiles &s;hall come to thy light, and kings to the brightne&s;s of thy ri&s;ing.</HI> Many more ble&s;&s;ings of a &s;imilar nature are promi&s;ed, and the chapter is clo&s;ed with the words of the text. THY PEOPLE ALSO SHALL BE ALL RIGHTEOUS, &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE prophet addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to the Church, or Zion. THY PEOPLE SHALL BE ALL RIGHTEOUS, therefore, may intend, that all the profe&s;&s;ing peo|ple of God &s;hall be internally and per&s;onally righteous; that <HI>every one that nameth the name of Chri&s;t &s;hall depart from iniquity.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. iii.19.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE expre&s;&s;ion may extend in its meaning, to the conver&s;ion of the Gentiles from dumb idols to the living God, and the &s;pread of chri&s;tianity through the world&punc; The former is the mo&s;t probable. In either con&s;truction, the increa&s;e and pro&s;perity of the church are intended. This is to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>THE people thus <HI>righteous</HI> SHALL INHERIT THE LAND FOR EVER. This may teach us, that the church and all good people are the peculiar choice and care

of God, and &s;hall be pre&s;erved. For <HI>them</HI> more e&s;|pecially, the earth is upheld, and made fruitful. For <HI>them,</HI> civil governments are in&s;tituted and changed, the nations controled, and the world continued.

<P>THE BRANCH OF MY PLANTING, THE WORK OF MY HANDS, are expre&s;&s;ions which evidently, in this place, intend, and apply to the church. El&s;ewhere, THE BRANCH &s;ignifies the &s;ame.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. iv.2.</NOTE> In other pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture it has a different meaning.

Zac. iii.8.</NOTE> So by THE WORK OF GOD'S HANDS, we are &s;ometimes to under&s;tand his works of creation and providence. But the church, in|cluding religion, is emphatically THE WORK of God. Hence the prophet prays, <HI>Lord, revive thy work.</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Hab. iii.2.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE Lord will pro&s;per the church, THAT HE MAY BE GLORIFIED. In and by the church, God is <HI>actively</HI> GLORIFIED. But his care and love mani|fe&s;ted toward her, and by all his works of mercy, of ju&s;tice, and of judgment among the nations, he is, and he will be <HI>objectively</HI> GLORIFIED. The divine conduct towards the church, from fir&s;t to la&s;t, is, and will be va&s;tly more for the glory of God, than all his other works and ways re&s;pecting the children of men.</P>
<P>A LITTLE ONE SHALL BECOME A THOUSAND, AND A SMALL ONE A STRONG NATION, point us to the

va&s;t increa&s;e of the church, as to number and influ|ence from &s;mall beginnings. The words may al&s;o have re&s;pect to the growth of &s;tates and empires, under the &s;miles of Heaven.</P>
<P>I THE LORD WILL HASTEN IT IN HIS TIME. The Almighty will accompli&s;h the prophecies and pro|mi&s;es of his holy word in favor of Zion, and WILL HASTEN IT in the <HI>fitte&s;t time;</HI> or in Chri&s;t's time, when the triumphs of his cro&s;s &s;hall be &s;pread, and <HI>all &s;hall bow the knee to Je&s;us, and confe&s;s that He is Lord to the glory of God the Father.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. xlv.23. Phil. ii.10, 11.</NOTE></P>
<P>FROM our text in its connexion, the following comprehen&s;ive doctrine naturally ari&s;es, viz.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH the church hath been &s;mall in her beginning, yet the Lord hath encrea&s;ed her, and will do &s;o more abundantly, even to greatne&s;s and glory; and in order to this, he hath, and will cau&s;e earthly powers and governments to &s;ub&s;erve her intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>TO confirm and illu&s;trate this doctrine, and pre|pare the way for &s;ome occa&s;ional improvement and practical remarks, I &s;hall take a brief view of the <HI>&s;mall beginning and progre&s;s</HI> of the church and peo|ple of God; of what the Lord <HI>hath done, is doing, hath promi&s;ed,</HI> and, therefore, <HI>will perform</HI> IN HIS TIME, in behalf of his <HI>peculiar people.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="024747_0009_0FC868515D08F7D8" MS="y">LITTLE needs be &s;aid to prove, that the church hath been very &s;mall in her beginning, and the cau&s;e of religion in the world apparently weak and neglected. From Adam to the flood, through the &s;pace of about &s;ix hundred years, we find on &s;acred record, as leading characters, only Abel, Seth, Enoch and Noah. It is probable, however, that the po&s;|terity of Seth, who are &s;uppo&s;ed to be called <HI>the &s;ons of God,</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Gen. vi&middot;2.</NOTE> did maintain, for &s;ome time, the wor|&s;hip of the true God; untill they formed contracts of marriage with <HI>the daughters of men,</HI> who are al&s;o &s;uppo&s;ed to be the de&s;cendants of Cain.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Stackhou&s;e's Compl.

<P>SHOULD we pa&s;s by all periods and places but tho&s;e of <HI>our</HI> forefathers, the &s;mallne&s;s of the church, and of the people is obvious. A <HI>&s;mall</HI> number from Holland, whither they had fled from civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical oppre&s;&s;ion and per&s;ecution in Eng|land,

landed at Plymouth, December 22d, 1620. That number was &s;oon greatly dimini&s;hed by mor|tal &s;ickne&s;s. They were A LITTLE, A SMALL ONE. But A LITTLE ONE HATH BECOME A THOUSAND, AND A SMALL ONE A STRONG NATION, both as to the church and the &s;tate. THE BRANCH OF GOD's PLANTING hath increa&s;ed, not only in this, but in other countries; not only in our days, but in other periods of the world. Compare the church in Noah's and Abraham's time, with her &s;tate and number when I&s;rael was delivered from Egyptian bondage, and when the cho&s;en nation flouri&s;hed in Canaan, and the increa&s;e appears great.</P>
<P>IN the reign of king Solomon, <HI>things went well in Judah,</HI> and in all I&s;rael. The civil polity of the &s;tate, and the religious intere&s;ts of the church were happy and flouri&s;hing. Then was built and con|&s;ecrated for the &s;pecial pre&s;ence and public wor&s;hip of God, the magnificent and va&s;tly expen&s;ive tem|ple.

<P>AT the time of Chri&s;t's advent, religion was in a declined &s;tate. By the preaching of John the Bap|ti&s;t, it was revived.

<P>THIS TOWN was incorporated as a plantation, at <HI>Mu&s;quetequid,</HI> <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">The original Indian name.</NOTE> by the name of CONCORD, by an act of the General Court of the then pro|vince, held at <HI>Newtown,</HI> September 3d, 1635. <NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">This is made certain by the records in the Secreta|ry's office of this Commonwealth.</NOTE>

The town was fairly purcha&s;ed of the natives, and payment duly made to their &s;atisfaction.

William Butterick and Richard Rice, and two chri&s;tian Indians, viz. Jehojakin and Jethro. They unitedly te&s;tify and &s;ay, "That they were pre&s;ent at the making the bargain for the town of Concord.&mdash;That at the hou&s;e of Mr Peter Bulkeley. (the Rev. <HI>P.</HI> Bulkeley) Mr. Simon Willard, Mr. John Jones, Mr. Spencer and others, did purcha&s;e of Squaw Sachem, Tahattawau and Nimrod, a tract of land &s;ix miles &s;quare, the centre being the place (or near) where the bargain was made.&mdash;That &s;aid Wil|lard and others did pay for &s;aid land in wampam peage, hatchets, hoes, knives, cotton cloth and chintz, to the &s;aid Indians.&mdash;And, that Wappacowet, hu&s;band to Squaw Sa|chem, received a &s;uit of cotton cloth, a hat, a white, linen band, &s;hoes, &s;tocking and a great coat, on account of &s;aid bargain.&mdash;That in the conclu&s;ion, the Indians decla|red, that they were &s;atisfied, and that the Engli&s;h were welcome."</P>
<P>The above depo&s;itions were taken by authority, before Thomas Danforth, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of Cambridge, and are recorded in the town-book of Concord, in lieu of the fir&s;t town records which were <HI>burnt.</HI></P></NOTE> Additions were afterward made by grant and purcha&s;e.</P>

<P>A FEW practical remarks &s;hall clo&s;e this di&s;|cour&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> IN all the concerns and increa&s;e of the church, God &s;hould be acknowledged and prai&s;ed. This is peculiarly the duty of a people profe&s;&s;ing godline&s;s, and embracing chri&s;tianity. As <HI>in all our ways,</HI> &s;o e&s;pecially in religious concernments, we &s;hould <HI>acknowledge God, a&s;k wi&s;dom of him,</HI> and be ever ready to &s;ay, <HI>Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truths &s;ake.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;a. cxv.1.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="024747_0045_0FC868C8F8ED9FA8">SINCE the canon of &s;cripture hath been com|pleated, &s;uch vi&s;ible manife&s;tations of Deity are not to be expected, as were frequent under the Theocracy of the Jewi&s;h nation; yet the Lord is not the le&s;s pre&s;ent with his people, and hath not the le&s;s love to his church. Her &s;upport and increa&s;e ever have been, and ever will be of the power and grace of God. <HI>For his own Name &s;ake,</HI> he will pre&s;erve and pro&s;per Zion. Collectively and in|dividually, &s;he is dear to him <HI>as the apple of his eye.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xvii.8.</NOTE> The Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t <HI>is head over all things to the church;</HI> and hath <HI>all power given unto him&punc; both in heaven and in earth.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eph. i.22. Mal. xxviii.18.</NOTE> To our Savior God let chri&s;tians ever &s;eek, and offer uncea&s;ing prai&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> IT is the obvious duty of all to im|prove, and co-operate with every revival of reli|gion. Every commotion among people, with pre|ten&s;ions to religion, is not a genuine concern to know and obey the Lord. <HI>Every &s;pirit is not of God.</HI> We are, therefore, directed to <HI>try the &s;pirits, whether they are of God.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Joh. iv.1, 2, 3.</NOTE> But there are times, when the Spirit of God is &s;ent down in more plentiful ef|fu&s;ions; when <HI>the Lord cometh and raineth down righteou&s;ne&s;s. Then</HI> the minds of men are more &s;u&s;ceptible of divine impre&s;&s;ions, and opened to receive the truth. For &s;uch times the godly pray, as did the prophet, <HI>O Lord revive thy work.</HI> When &s;uch &s;ea&s;ons do come, and people are inquiring the way to heaven, the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel &s;hould be very attentive to di&s;cern, and faithful to
<PB N="48" REF="024747_0046_0FC868CA972CDC80">
improve the favourable opportunity for the con|ver&s;ion of &s;inners, and the comfort and confirma|tion of believers. Tho&s;e who are <HI>men</HI> in Chri&s;t al&s;o, tho' not teachers, &s;hould gently lead <HI>babes</HI> to <HI>the &s;incere milk of the word, that they may grow thereby.</HI> All &s;hould welcome and join &s;uch influ|ence as di&s;po&s;es &s;inners to inquire <HI>what they &s;hall do to be &s;aved,</HI> and <HI>the wicked to for&s;ake his way.</HI> All &s;hould be very careful not to <HI>break the brui&s;ed reed, nor quench the &s;moking flax.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. xii.20.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> I SHALL here be permitted, I tru&s;t, a very natural remark which re&s;pects the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t. It ari&s;es, my fathers and brethren, from our office; and is contained in the words of the apo&s;tle: <HI>We then are workers together with God.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. vi.1.</NOTE> We are commi&s;&s;ioned and &s;ent forth for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of promoting the intere&s;ts of religion, the increa&s;e of the church, and the &s;al|vation of precious &s;ouls. We are engaged in the &s;ame glorious cau&s;e of <HI>peace on earth and good will to men,</HI> leading to heavenly glory, with the God of all grace, the Savior of &s;inners, and the Spirit of truth. Men never were employed in a better cau&s;e than <HI>that</HI> which we plead. It mu&s;t be plea&s;ant to a benevolent mind, to proclaim pardon to the guilty, &s;alvation to the wretched, and to <HI>be&s;eech</HI> &s;inners <HI>to be reconciled to God.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. v.20.</NOTE> Can we be indo|lent? Shall we not exert our&s;elves? Yes; through Chri&s;t &s;trengthening us, we will <HI>take heed to our|&s;elves, and to our doctrine.</HI> We will carry the church, and the &s;ouls of our people, in the arms

of our affection and prayer, to the throne of grace.

<P><HI>Fourthly.</HI> IN the darke&s;t times, as to religion, there is ground for faith and hope. God is in the church, and is engaged to defend and pro&s;per her. IN HIS TIME HE WILL HASTEN IT. The <HI>burning bu&s;h</HI> which Mo&s;es &s;aw in <HI>Horeb,</HI> ju&s;tly repre&s;ents the church. <HI>The bu&s;h burned; but was not con|&s;umed. The Lord was in the mid&s;t of the bu&s;h.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ex. iii.2, 4.</NOTE> So he is in the mid&s;t of the church, in all her afflic|tions and trials, and will never &s;uffer her to be <HI>con&s;umed. The Lord hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon his afflicted.</HI> The mo&s;t glo|rious works of God, before the children of men, have been in behalf of the church. Our di&s;cour&s;e has been chiefly to this point.</P>
<P>SHOULD <HI>mothers</HI> prove mon&s;ters, and <HI>forget</HI> to nouri&s;h their tender babes, <HI>yet, &s;aith the Lord, will I not forget thee. Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands, thy walls are continu|ally before me.</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. xlix.15, 16.</NOTE> With &s;uch precious promi&s;es of &s;uch an Almighty Friend, the church may <HI>rejoice in hope,</HI> amid&s;t the mo&s;t gloomy appearances.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="024747_0048_0FC868D2902E5968"><HI>Fifthly.</HI> WE remark, the unavailing power of the enemies of the church, and of religion. To &s;uch enemies we may &s;ay, <HI>Perceive ye how ye pre|vail nothing?</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Joh. xii.19.</NOTE> Were they duly to read the holy &s;criptures, and con&s;ider the divine procedure, they would tremble at the thought of being enemies to religion, and the people of God.

They who &s;et them&s;elves again&s;t the honor of God, the peace, happine&s;s and &s;alvation of men, may be certain, that, in &s;uch a mind, they <HI>&s;hall peri&s;h, and be ut|terly wa&s;ted. To the Lord belongeth vengeance and recompence; their foot &s;hall &s;lide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that &s;hall come upon them make ha&s;te.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Deut. xxxii.35.</NOTE> It is <HI>the madne&s;s of folly</HI> to oppo&s;e <HI>that</HI> cau&s;e which the infinite God is engaged to promote, even to the utter de&s;truction of its enemies.</P>
<P>THE church may &s;ay, as Eli&s;ha &s;aid to his &s;er|vant, when a ho&s;t compa&s;&s;ed the city to de&s;troy him. <HI>Fear not; for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Kings vi.16.</NOTE></P>
<P>IT has been &s;hown abundantly, that no wi&s;dom, nor might, nor dignity of man, can prevail again&s;t God. <HI>If God be for us, who can be again&s;t us?</HI> <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii.31.</NOTE> Con&s;ider the&s;e things, ye who forget God, who

<P>ONCE more. Our duty, intere&s;t and happine&s;s, all urge us to join the cau&s;e of God and religion, of Chri&s;t and the church. This is obvious thro' the whole di&s;cour&s;e. Let all who hear me, be per&s;uaded to this. Let every one <HI>bow the knee to Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and regulate their faith and practice by his heavenly doctrines and example. My hearers, <HI>it is not a vain thing for you; becau&s;e it is your life.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Deut. xxxii.47.</NOTE> <HI>Choo&s;e this day whom you will &s;erve;</HI> and henceforth, may we all be the true di&s;ci|ples of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and qualified to join the church triumphant in endle&s;s glory.</P>
<P>WITH overcoming faith, lively hope and ardent prayer, let chri&s;tians look forward to the future peace, purity and glory of the church, predicted and promi&s;ed in the holy &s;criptures. The pro&s;|pect is calculated to animate you in duty, and to comfort you under &s;orrows. I have a di&s;po&s;ition to dwell upon this thought; but, perhaps, I have already been too lengthy.</P>
<P>I WILL clo&s;e, therefore, with the prophetic words of the P&s;almi&s;t, ultimately expre&s;&s;ive of future, &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings to the go&s;pel church and children of God. <HI>They &s;hall fear thee, as long
