</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WITHOUT enquiring into the par|ticular meaning of the&s;e words, con&s;idered in a &s;en&s;e re&s;trained by their coherence with what pro|ceeds and follows, I &s;hall take them as an independent &s;entence; in which detached view, they comprehend all tho&s;e duties of civil and &s;ocial life, which mankind owe to one another, whatever difference there may be among them, as to their re&s;pective capa|cities and outward condition in the world.</P>
<P>As men are formed for &s;ociety, and can|not be happy in a &s;tate of &s;eparation from
<PB N="6" REF="017899_0005_0FA37C0601D9A9D0">
one another; &s;o their well-being depends upon mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance and &s;upport, and a reciprocal interchange of tho&s;e offices of friend&s;hip and benevolence, which their mutual dependence requires, and both rea|&s;on and religion pre&s;cribe.</P>
<P>That all men ought in &s;ome &s;en&s;e to be <HI>&s;ubject to one another,</HI> is the plain doctrine of the apo&s;tle Peter, in the words ju&s;t read. This doctrine concerns all &s;ocieties, under every form and con&s;titution of government, whether monarchal, popular or mixed. It is e&s;pecially &s;uited to the genius of a commonwealth, founded upon this leading principle, that "all men are born free and equal;" that is, come into the world on even ground in regard to authority; no one having a right to govern, in virtue of primogeniture, or de&s;cent from an higher and more noble parentage than others.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject therefore is worthy of the attention of this re&s;pectable auditory; and the &s;peaker has no doubt but they will afford him their can did indulgence, while he mode&s;tly attempts to offer a few thoughts upon it, though he &s;hould not be able to handle it, in a manner an&s;werable to it's dignity and importance.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="017899_0006_0FA37C06C1836F98">According to it's mo&s;t common u&s;e, the word <HI>&s;ubjection</HI> &s;ignifies the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of an inferior to a &s;uperior, and applies only to tho&s;e duties, which men owe to tho&s;e, who have authority over them. In order therefore to accommodate the doctrine of mutual &s;ubjection, to all the members of a community, we mu&s;t &s;ometimes depart from the &s;trict &s;en&s;e of this word, or vary the meaning of it, &s;o as to make it con&s;i&s;t with the differences between men, in regard to their &s;everal abilities; and with tho&s;e di&s;tinctions of office, rank and authority, which are nece&s;&s;ary in &s;ociety.</P>
<P>It is evident that the duties, which men owe to one another, and to &s;ociety, are not, in all ca&s;es, preci&s;ely the &s;ame; but mu&s;t be different, according to the difference of their re&s;pective advantages, opportunities and other circum&s;tances. And when any one fulfils the obligations re&s;ulting from his particular condition and &s;tation in life; or that ari&s;e from the particular &s;phere of action, whether high or low, in which he moves; he does, on his part, conform to the great law of mutual &s;ubjection, and render him&s;elf a good and u&s;eful member of &s;ociety.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="017899_0007_0FA37C0780136CA8">Every one ought to con&s;ider, that he was born, not for him&s;elf alone, but for others, for &s;ociety, for his country; and con&s;e|quently that he is indi&s;pen&s;ibly obliged to render the be&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance and &s;ervice in his power, to his fellow-citizens around him, and to contribute his &s;hare towards the general intere&s;t of the community to which he belongs. This obligation is not con|fined to a few; but extends to all, from the highe&s;t officer in the &s;tate, through all &s;ubordinate ranks, and interior orders and degrees, down to the lowe&s;t pea&s;ant and plebcan. For though all are not able to render them&s;elves u&s;eful and beneficial, in the &s;ame re&s;pects; yet there is no one, who enjoys the powers of rea&s;on and health, in any tolerable degree, but may, by a &s;uitable employment of his faculties and abilities, not only &s;erve him&s;elf, but the public, and make him&s;elf a ble&s;&s;ing, in &s;ome re&s;pect or other.</P>
<P>There is a re&s;emblance between the natu|ral body and the body politic. The natural body is compo&s;ed of many members; none of which are u&s;ele&s;s; but all calculated to an&s;wer &s;ome valuable purpo&s;e, and &s;ub&s;erve the good of the whole. What therefore the apo&s;tle Paul &s;ays of the natural body
<PB N="9" REF="017899_0008_0FA37C08C4547988">
with a view to illu&s;trate the union, which ought to &s;ub&s;i&s;t between the members of the chri&s;tian church, is equally applicable to civil &s;ocieties. <HI>The body, &s;ays he, is not one member, but many. If the foot &s;hall &s;ay, Becau&s;e I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? And if the ear &s;hall &s;ay, Becau&s;e I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole body were hearing, where were the &s;melling? But now hath God &s;et the members, every one of them in the body, as it hath plea&s;ed him.&mdash;The eye cannot &s;ay unto the hand, I have no need of thee; nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. Nay, much more tho&s;e members of the body, which &s;eem to be more &s;eeble, are neces&s;ary.&mdash;God hath &s;o tempered the body together, &mdash;that there &s;hould be no &s;chi&s;m in it; but that the members &s;hould have the &s;ame care one for another. And whether one member &s;uffer, all the members &s;uffer with it; or one mem|ber be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.</HI> So that the union and connection between the &s;everal parts of the natural body, and their nece&s;&s;ary dependance one on another, is an apt illu&s;tration of the great law of mutual &s;ubjection in civil
<PB N="10" REF="017899_0009_0FA37C0946FF2340">
&s;ocieties; the members whereof, whether rich or poor, in high life or low, in office or out of it, &s;tand in need of mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance and &s;upport; without which it will be im|po&s;&s;ible to promote the common intere&s;t, or to pre&s;erve the peace and harmony of the whole.</P>
<P>A man's being rai&s;ed above others in wealth or office, does not render him inde|pendent on tho&s;e who are beneath him, in the&s;e re&s;pects. He cannot &s;ay, he has no need of tho&s;e, who are in a lower condition and meaner circum&s;tances; for, without Their aid and &s;ervice, he would lo&s;e the advantage of his elevation; and, like Sam|&s;on, &s;horn of his locks, become weak like other men.</P>
<P>The mechanic and tiller of the ground are as nece&s;&s;ary in &s;ociety as the legi&s;lator, civil magi&s;trate, or any other profe&s;&s;ion. The labours of the poor and &s;ervices of the lower cla&s;&s;es of people, in their &s;everal callings and occupations, are of as great importance to the general welfare of a &s;tate, as the coun&s;el of the wi&s;e, the bounty of the rich, and protection of the powerful. If therefore any one, capable of attending to the common bu&s;ine&s;s of life, is an un|profitable
<PB N="11" REF="017899_0010_0FA37C09C1DBD098">
and u&s;ele&s;s member of the com|munity, it is not owing to any nece&s;&s;ity ari&s;ing from his outward condition in the world, but to &s;ome faulty cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Whoever, &s;uppre&s;&s;ing a regard for the good of others, confines him&s;elf to the narrow circle of his own private intere&s;t, does thereby render him&s;elf, at be&s;t, a nu|&s;ance to &s;ociety. Such an one can have no ju&s;t claim to honour and re&s;pect, let his &s;tation in life be what it will. It is not the external &s;plendor of their circum&s;tances, but a con&s;tant endeavour to be good, and to do good, according to their abilities, that makes men truly great and honourable. In the &s;ight of God, who <HI>re&s;pecteth not per&s;ons,</HI> but in judging of men regards only the moral differences between them, no out|ward condition is more honourable than another. The true criterion of real worth is a man's conduct, in that &s;tation or po&s;t in life, whether con&s;picuous or ob&s;cure, which providence has allotted to him.</P>
<P>It is the bu&s;ine&s;s of civil rulers, who are intru&s;ted with the high powers of govern|ment, to enact and take care for the effectual execution of &s;uch laws, as &s;hall be be&s;t calculated to re&s;train the exorbitancy of the
<PB N="12" REF="017899_0011_0FA37C0A9C112A58">
human pa&s;&s;ions to guard individuals again&s;t in&s;ults and outrages, and &s;ecure every one in the peaceable enjoyment of liberty, pro|perty and all the ble&s;&s;ings of &s;ociety. And while they employ their authority and power in pur&s;uit of the&s;e great ends of their promotion, it is the duty and intere&s;t of people at large, to yield a chearful obedience to them, and a ready compliance with tho&s;e rules, regulations and laws, which are made and provided, for the benefit of each particular member, in harmony with the pro&s;perity and welfare of the whole collective body.</P>
<P>The grand end of &s;ocial union and of the in&s;titution of civil government, is the good of the whole, and of every individual in con&s;i&s;tence therewith. This end may be fru&s;trated, not only by an abu&s;e of power in rulers; but al&s;o by an abu&s;e of liberty in the people. Power abu&s;ed cea&s;es to be lawful authority, and degenerates into tyranny. Liberty abu&s;ed, or carried to exce&s;s, is licenciou&s;ne&s;s. Neither of the&s;e can con&s;i&s;t with the good of &s;ociety. The former, unre&s;i&s;ted, will introduce &s;lavery, and ignominious &s;ervitude, among the lower ranks and orders of people. The latter is a prolific &s;ource of di&s;order and anarchy.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="017899_0012_0FA37C0BD3754AF0">When rulers take the advantage of the powers they are ve&s;ted with, to oppre&s;s their &s;ubjects and rob people of their ju&s;t rights, in order to inrich and aggrandize them&s;elves, they counteract the very end of their advancement, and in&s;tead of being <HI>mini&s;ters of God for good,</HI> become rods of his &s;chool for correction (not to &s;ay, mini|&s;ters of the devil for mi&s;chief.) And when people, under presence of liberty, refu&s;e obedience to lawful authority, and oppo&s;e the mea&s;ures of ju&s;t government, meerly becau&s;e &s;uch mea&s;ures do not coincide with their private views and &s;epa rate intere&s;ts, the principles on which they act, are evidently incon&s;i&s;tent with a &s;tate of &s;ociety, and lead directly back to a &s;tate of nature. For where &s;uch an exce&s;s of liberty is claimed and allowed, as leaves it optional with every individual to obey or di&s;obey the civil autho|rity, according as he &s;hall judge it to be for or again&s;t his particular intere&s;t, a &s;tate of &s;ociety cannot differ much from a &s;tate of nature.</P>
<P>If every man, without compul&s;ion, would &s;trictly conform to the obligations of natural law, there would be no occa&s;ion for form|ing any &s;ocial connections, or uniting under any forms of civil government. But &s;uch
<PB N="14" REF="017899_0013_0FA37C0C04C1DD70">
is evidently the &s;tate of human nature; &s;uch the di&s;order of the human pa&s;&s;ions; &s;uch the power or envy, prejudice and a lu&s;t of domination; &s;uch the force of evil bya&s;&s;es, proceeding from ignorance, contracted views and competitions of intere&s;t; that without the introduction of &s;ocial compact and civil authority, mankind could have no depen|dence upon mutual help and a&s;&s;istance, nor any &s;ecurity again&s;t abu&s;es and injuries, violence and rapine.</P>
<P>It being nece&s;&s;ary for men to unite in &s;ociety, and e&s;tabli&s;h civil government, in order effectually to avail them&s;elves of the advantages of mutual &s;uccour, defence and protection; without which, their enjoy|ments would be few and precarious, and their inconveniences and dangers great and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing: this being the ca&s;e, every one, who has ju&s;t conceptions of things (far from claiming a liberty to do whatever his ambition, avarice or partiality to him&s;elf might dictate to be right) mu&s;t feel him&s;elf obliged to con&s;ult the general welfare, by conforming to the laws of &s;ociety, con&s;ti|tutionally made by public authority, for the good of the whole; though &s;uch laws &s;hould &s;ometimes interfere with his private views, and contradict his prejudices.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="017899_0014_0FA37C0CC1917188">The public good is the attracting point, the common centre of gravity, which &s;hould con&s;ine, regulate and govern the motions of all the members of &s;ociety. When any fly off from this point and take an excentric cour&s;e, the coercion of law &s;hould be u&s;ed, to check their irregular motions, and reduce them back to their proper centre, in order that the economy and beauty of the politic &s;y&s;tem may be pre&s;erved, and the bands of &s;ociety remain unbroken.</P>
<P>That a due &s;ubordination may be kept up between the &s;everal parts of the politic body; and all the members thereof be made to con&s;pire, in the exerci&s;e of their re&s;pective functions, to the health and happine&s;s of the whole; effectual care &s;hould be taken to prevent government from falling into contempt. To honour tho&s;e, who are in|tru&s;ted with the powers of government, is one thing, evidently nece&s;&s;ary for this end. This therefore is a duty which we owe to &s;ociety. And that people may have no excu&s;e for not doing their duty, in this re|&s;pect, it concerns all civil officers, e&s;pecially tho&s;e in high rank and authority, to main|tain their dignity, by a decent gravity of deportment, an inflexible adherence to the rules of ju&s;tice and equity, and a &s;teady
<PB N="16" REF="017899_0015_0FA37C0D82E22CA8">
application to the bu&s;ine&s;s of their exalted &s;tations. Such a conduct, in rulers, has a powerful tendency to attract e&s;teem, and command re&s;pect and veneration. But tho' they &s;hould ju&s;tly merit the highe&s;t honours, by a worthy behaviour, and a zealous uni|form pur&s;uit of the great ends of their pro|motion, it would not be at all &s;trange, to find &s;ome few, di&s;po&s;ed to withold from them due re&s;pect and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. For there always have been, and probably always will be, &s;ome in the world, who under the baneful influence of tho&s;e levelling principles, that cannot brook any civil di&s;tinctions and re|&s;traints, <HI>de&s;pi&s;e government,</HI> and <HI>&s;peak evil of dignities.</HI> Per&s;ons of this de&s;cription are dangerous members of &s;ociety, as their prin|ciples and practices are &s;ubver&s;ive of all civil authority, and tend directly to plunge civil government into an univer&s;al wrack of ruin.</P>
<P>It de&s;erves to be remembred, that we honour &s;ociety, when we honour tho&s;e, who are cloathed with lawful authority. For as all lawful authority in rulers, is derived from the people, through the medium of that con&s;titutional compact, which binds them together in one body; &s;o to treat the rulers of a people, with re&s;pect and hono<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r,
<PB N="17" REF="017899_0016_0FA37C0E418F9110">
&s;uitable to their public characters, and the offices which they &s;u&s;tain, is a proper ex|pre&s;&s;ion of that reverence, which individuals owe to the community, as a body. I may add, that as the re&s;pect &s;hewn to tho&s;e, who are in public &s;tations, redounds to the pub|lic; &s;o it al&s;o tends to make a people appear re&s;pectable, and to give to government the energy, nece&s;&s;ary for attaining the ends of it. On the contrary, to withold re&s;pect from tho&s;e, who have been con&s;titutionally promoted to offices of authority and power, is to ca&s;t a flight and contempt on the whole body of the people, and tends to make a &s;ociety appear mean and de&s;picable, to relax the reins of government and undermine the very foundations of it.</P>
<P>It is rea&s;onable indeed for a people to keep a jealous eye upon tho&s;e, who are betru&s;ted with power, in the &s;everal departments of government. This is nece&s;&s;ary to keep them on their guard again&s;t all encroachments on their liberties, and to pre&s;erve them in a readine&s;s to re&s;i&s;t the fir&s;t approaches of de&s;poti&s;m. But &s;u&s;picions may be carried too far. When upon in&s;ufficient grounds, they are indulged to &s;uch a degree, as to de&s;troy all confidence in civil rulers, and encourage the impatience of people under
<PB N="18" REF="017899_0017_0FA37C0F02DE0A10">
the re&s;traints of law, they are of dangerous con&s;equence; as they plant the feeds of fac|tion, a convul&s;ive di&s;ea&s;e, that threatens the di&s;&s;olution of the body politic. When &s;action enters a &s;tate, with its u&s;ual train of virulence, malevolence and abu&s;ive invective, it un&s;trings the nerves of government, and introduces &s;uch di&s;order and uncertainty into public mea&s;ures, and &s;uch &s;trife and divi&s;ion among people, as are incon&s;i&s;tent with the public &s;afety, &s;ecurity and pro&s;pe|rity. This di&s;temper is generally the off|&s;pring of envy and di&s;appointed ambition. Avarice always &s;tands ready to fo&s;ter and nur&s;e, to increa&s;e and inflame it, by ground|le&s;s criminations of men and mea&s;ures; e&s;pecially when the public exigences require heavy taxes, and expen&s;ive exertions.</P>
<P>The inconveniences and mi&s;chiefs, that mu&s;t acrue to &s;ociety, from this, and every other gro&s;s violation of the law of mutual &s;ubjection, are &s;ufficient to convince any one of the nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;trict adherence to it. Our obligation to avoid divi&s;ive principles and practices, and by a con&s;tant intercourse of mutual good offices, to endeavour to make our&s;elves beneficial to one another and &s;erviceable to &s;ociety, is therefore a plain dictate of rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e. I
<PB N="19" REF="017899_0018_0FA37C0FC26EFC60">
would add (if any de&s;ire further &s;atisfaction) that this obligation is enforced upon us, in the &s;acred &s;criptures, by the authority of the &s;upreme Legi&s;lator and Governor of the world. The words at the head of this di&s;|cour&s;e are the words of an apo&s;tle, under the in&s;piration of God. Another in&s;pired apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, in the&s;e words, <HI>Let no man &s;eek his own; but every man another's wealth.&mdash;Look not every man on his own things; but every man al&s;o on the things of others.</HI> The meaning of which is, that men ought not to confine their views to their own private intere&s;t, but to extend their regards to the welfare of others, and exerci&s;e a benevolent concern and care for the good of their fellow|creatures.</P>
<P>This al&s;o is a doctrine expre&s;sly taught by the great author of our holy religion, when he commands us to <HI>love our neighbour as our&s;elves</HI>; and enjoins upon us that com|prehen&s;ive rule of equity and charity, <HI>All things what&s;oever ye would that men &s;hould do to you, do ye even &s;o to them.</HI></P>
<P>It may not be improper to ob&s;erve here, that the chri&s;tian religion recommends it&s;elf to the embraces of every lover of mankind,
<PB N="20" REF="017899_0019_0FA37C108295F8D8">
by its being the mo&s;t benevolent in&s;titution in the world, admirably calculated, by it's doctrines, precepts and &s;anctions, to promote <HI>peace on earth,</HI> and <HI>good will among men.</HI> And whoever duly con&s;iders the nature of chri&s;tianity, and attends to it's adaptedne&s;s to &s;uppre&s;s the corrupt lu&s;ts, and re&s;train the irregular pa&s;&s;ions of men; to fill the mind with noble &s;entiments of piety and benevolence, and engage people in pur&s;uits, &s;uitable to the dignity, and conducive to the happine&s;s of their rea&s;onable natures; cannot doubt, but (other things being alike) he, who has imbibed the &s;pirit and principles of this religion, will make a better magi&s;trate, a better legi&s;lator, a better judge, and in &s;hort, fill every office and department in government, with more honour to him&s;elf and advantage to the public; and, in private life, make a better &s;ubject and a better citi|zen; than one who has formed his views and &s;entiments, upon any other &s;y&s;tem of religion and morals.</P>
<P>It has indeed been objected, as an e&s;&s;en|tial defect in chri&s;tianity, by &s;ome not well affected to it, that it no where particularly recommends the noble virtue of patrioti&s;m. But (not to in&s;i&s;t on any thing el&s;e) it is &s;ufficient to reply to this objection, that
<PB N="21" REF="017899_0020_0FA37C1141804318">
whatever there is excellent and laudable in patrioti&s;m, is included in that generous and diffu&s;ive benevolence, which is the animating &s;oul of this religion. Virtuous patrioti&s;m, far from implying any ill-will to the re&s;t of mankind, is nothing el&s;e, but the prin|ciple or univer&s;al benevolence, exerci&s;ed as far as a man's power extends, upon the objects that claim his fir&s;t regards. For as no one has ability to carry his good will to all men into effect; &s;o rea&s;on will teach every one, that his fir&s;t obligation is to tho&s;e, with whom he is more immediately connected, and where providence has a&s;&s;igned him his &s;tation and &s;phere of u&s;efulne&s;s. Should a man &s;uppre&s;s a particular affection for the &s;ociety, with which he is mo&s;t clo&s;ely united, and neglect the intere&s;t of his own country under pretence of exerci&s;ing equal benevolence towards all mankind, it would be the &s;ame thing, in effect as to re&s;olve to be u&s;ele&s;s, and neglect the good of all. For there is no other way, in which any one can render him&s;elf &s;erviceable to tho&s;e parts of the great community of mankind, with which he has no &s;pecial connection, than by the exerci&s;e of an hearty zeal for the welfare of his own country, and en|deavouring, in the mo&s;t effectual manner, to promote the good of that &s;ociety, which
<PB N="22" REF="017899_0021_0FA37C1202EC0FE8">
bounds the &s;phere of his influence and power. In this &s;en&s;e, and in this way, all men, in all the di&s;tinct &s;tates and kingdoms of the world, may and ought to <HI>&s;ubject to one another.</HI> It is thus only that we can fulfil our obligations to all mankind.</P>
<P>True it is, patrioti&s;m is but a blind affec|tion, and e&s;&s;entially defective as to any vir|tuous excellence, if it prompts a man to defend the cau&s;e of his country, when his country forms it&s;elf into a faction again&s;t the rights of mankind, and is wickedly en|deavouring to bring other &s;tates and nations under it's arbitrary juri&s;diction and govern|ment. No one, who will con&s;ult the &s;ober dictates of rea&s;on, can &s;uppo&s;e him&s;elf obli|ged to e&s;pou&s;e &s;uch an unrighteous cau&s;e, or freely to afford any &s;upport to his coun|try, in the pro&s;ecution of &s;uch an evil de|&s;ign. The principle of benevolence to all, clearly forbids this. But the &s;ame principle obliges the members of every community, to a zealous exertion, in defence of their rights, laws and liberties, when the &s;ame are indangered by the unrighteous claims, and violent proceedings of ambitious ene|mies. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, defen&s;ive war is a duty, founded not barely on the principles of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation and patrioti&s;m, but
<PB N="23" REF="017899_0022_0FA37C12C3992868">
al&s;o on the principle of unconfined univer|&s;al benevolence; it being evidently for the intere&s;t of all mankind, that in all parts of the world, tho&s;e &s;hould be oppo&s;ed, to the la&s;t extremity, who are endeavouring to advance them&s;elves upon the ruins or the e&s;&s;ential rights of human nature.</P>
<P>The man, who makes the happine&s;s and pro&s;perity of his country, a grand object of his zealous pur&s;uit, and generou&s;ly ri&s;ques his life and fortune, when the ca&s;e requires it, in the defence of it's con&s;titution and laws, is a character worthy of univer&s;al e&s;teem and honour. Such an one, &s;o far as his abilities extend, exerci&s;es friend&s;hip to all men. What then &s;hall we &s;ay of tho&s;e who, when the rights and liberties of their country, are in danger of falling a prey to the a&s;piring ambition of proud invaders, who have waged an unju&s;t war again&s;t it, &s;tand aloof, and not only refu&s;e to a&s;&s;i&s;t in &s;aving it from ruin, but de&s;ert it, and, of free choice, join the &s;tandard of the enemy? Can &s;uch per&s;ons make good their preten|&s;ions, I will not &s;ay to patrioti&s;m, but to general benevolence? Whatever be their motives, are they not to be viewed as ene|mies, if actions have any meaning? And &s;hould their country, which they have thus

But &s;hould any be &s;o inimical as to attempt any thing of this &s;ort, by &s;owing di&s;eord; foment|ing animo&s;ities; endeavouring to propa|gate unrea&s;onable jealou&s;ies and &s;u&s;picions, or to nouri&s;h and &s;trengthen local prejudices; it is hoped there is wisdom, virtue and re&s;o|lution enough among the friends of the country, to defeat their evil de&s;igns, and (m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ugre the utmo&s;t efforts of every incen|diary and mi&s;chief-maker) to pre&s;erve the union unbroken, and the confederacy un|inturrupted and intire.</P>

This is nece&s;&s;ary to gain us honour and confidence among other na|tions, and to pre&s;erve peace and union among our&s;elves. Every one therefore is obliged to contribute his &s;hare towards fulfilling the engagements and promi&s;es, made by lawful authority, in behalf of all the &s;tates, or of the particular &s;tate to which he belongs; that all, whether countrymen or foreigners, who have afforded or &s;hall afford any a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance or &s;ervice to the public, may receive ju&s;tly expected rewards; and none have rea|&s;on to complain, that they have been de|cieved and injured, by depending on public faith. Should any be di&s;po&s;ed to violate their obligations, in this re&s;pect, the civil magi&s;trate has undoubted authority, and ought to compel them to their duty; for if every one might be left at liberty, to do <HI>what is right in his own eyes,</HI> public credit would &s;tand upon a precarious foundation, and be continually liable to be &s;acrificed to the humour, caprice and avarice of individuals.</P>
<P>Though public credit has been in a declin|ing &s;tate, yet we are glad there is an hopeful pro&s;pect of its recovery. What particular

methods are be&s;t for placing it on a firm and durable ba&s;is, I have not the vanity to think my&s;elf capable of determining.

<P>It cannot be thought &s;trange, that a di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing war, of eight years continuance, has involved us in a great debt. But con&s;idering the magnitude of the object, which we have had in pur&s;uit, and the great exertions which we have been obliged to make in order to attain it, our debt is not &s;o great, as might have been expected. Tho&s;e nations, which are now groaning under the iron yoke of oppre&s;&s;ion, and de&s;potic government, would think them&s;elves happy, if they could

purcha&s;e the invaluable ble&s;&s;ings of liberty, at &s;o cheap a rate. There is yet another con|&s;ideration, which alone is &s;ufficient to &s;ilence all complaints, on this head. It is this, that if we had been reunited to Britain, and in addition to other expences, had had a pro|portional &s;hare of her enormous debt laid upon us, it would have hung like a mill&s;tone about our necks, and plunged us into inevi|table banckrupty, from which we never could have recovered our&s;elves. Our pre&s;ent burden, tho' &s;omewhat pre&s;&s;ing, is compa|ratively light. Let prodigality, luxury, and other impoveri&s;hing vices be bani&s;hed from among us; and let frugality, oeconomy and indu&s;try &s;upply their place; and then con&s;i|dering our means and re&s;ources, it will not be &s;o difficult to di&s;charge our debt, in the cour&s;e of a few years, as &s;ome may imagine. And while the legi&s;lature, in levying taxes, for this and other important purpo&s;es, take all po&s;&s;ible care to make the burden as light as the public exigences will permit, and to adju&s;t each man's &s;hare of the public expence to his intere&s;t and circum&s;tances, every one, in&s;tead of indulging a murmuring temper, &s;hould chearfully endeavour to defray his part, rejoicing that &s;uch wile provi&s;ion is made for <HI>judgment to run down as waters, and righteou&s;ne&s;s as a mighty &s;tream.</HI></P>

It is an ob&s;ervation of a king, as much celebrated for his wi&s;dom as magnificence, and may be laid down as a maxim, confirmed by the experience of all ages, that <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a nation.</HI> According to the natural cour&s;e of things, and common order of providence, that &s;o|ciety has the faire&s;t pro&s;pect of pro&s;perity, and la&s;ting felicity, where government, fir&s;t founded in equity, is admini&s;tered according to the rules of impartial ju&s;tice; and where truth, hone&s;ty and fidelity are encouraged, maintained and promoted between man and man, in their private intercour&s;e and tran&s;ac|tions. In this ca&s;e, peace and harmony will prevail among the members of a &s;ociety; who will con&s;equently be in a &s;uitable di&s;|po&s;ition to &s;erve one another, and to unite in &s;uch mea&s;ures as the general intere&s;t &s;hall, at any time, require.

<P>Though unrighteou&s;ne&s;s may &s;ometimes an&s;wer a pre&s;ent purpo&s;e; yet follow it a little way, in it's con&s;equences, and it will be found to be the parent of difficulty and trouble of embarra&s;&s;ment and perplexity. There can be no danger or hazard in ad|hering to the rules of ju&s;tice; but what is morally wrong can never be good policy, in reference either to public or private affairs.</P>
<P>There is nothing more manife&s;t, than that the intere&s;t of a people is greatly affected, by the virtues and vices prevalent among them. From hence the inference is obvious, that the morals of a people are among the great objects, which claim the particular attention of the legi&s;lature and civil authority. It evidently falls within their province, to provide means, by law, for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of vice and wickedne&s;s, and the promotion of good morals. In order effectually to an&s;wer the&s;e ends, care &s;hould be taken for the diffu&s;ion of learning and religion through a &s;ociety; that people may entertain ju&s;t

conceptions of the dignity and rights of hu|man nature, and be early initiated in the principles of a &s;ober, hone&s;t and pious life. The general prevalence of ignorance and irreligion mu&s;t be productive of very mi&s;|chievous effects in &s;ociety. For ignorant minds, unimpre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of a Deity, of a providence and a future &s;tate, mu&s;t be unprincipled, and prepared, whenever occa|&s;ions offer, for the mo&s;t atrocious crimes. I would ju&s;t add, that an ignorant people, are continually liable to be impo&s;ed upon, and &s;educed into a &s;urrender of their liber|ties, by the &s;pecious arts, eloquence and addre&s;s of de&s;igning men. who&s;e enterpri|zing ambition will not fail to lay hold on &s;uch an advantage, for the acqui&s;ition of power.</P>
<P>Sen&s;ible of how great importance it is to the happine&s;s of a people, to be early in|&s;tructed in the principles of piety and virtue, and furni&s;hed with good degrees of know|ledge, re&s;pecting the things of this world and that to come, our worthy ance&s;tors were induced to take effectual care for the encou|ragement and &s;upport of the liberal arts and &s;ciences; for the pre&s;ervation of a reve|rential &s;en&s;e of a Deity on people's minds; for the in&s;truction of all in religion and good

literature. Great and invaluable are the ble&s;&s;ings, that have been derived to us, their po&s;terity, from their pious care, in the&s;e re&s;pects; a con&s;ideration whereof &s;hould provoke us to imitation; that as we have rea&s;on to honour their memory, for the ex|cellent provi&s;ion they made for our happine&s;s and welfare, &s;o our de&s;cendents may have equal rea&s;on to <HI>ri&s;e up and call us ble&s;&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P>Our new con&s;titution, while it has pro|vided every guard, which human wi&s;dom can invent, to defend our liberties, civil and religious, again&s;t every encroachment of arbi|trary power, has authorized but civil rulers to take care of the morals of people, by furni&s;hing them with the means of in&s;truc|tion in virtue, piety and every branch of u&s;eful knowledge. They will therefore con&s;ider them&s;elves as obliged to adopt &s;uit|able mea&s;ures for the encouragement of literature, the advancement of the &s;ciences, and the pre&s;ervation of a &s;en&s;e of religion among all orders of men.</P>
<P>To &s;ay nothing of other literary in&s;titu|tions, which claim the patronage of our political fathers, and of all the friends of &s;cience; let me ob&s;erve, that the laws pro|viding for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;chools, in
<PB N="46" REF="017899_0045_0FA37C24006159E0">
our &s;everal towns and plantations, are wi&s;ely calculated to promote the great ends of &s;ociety, by affording to all, the nece&s;&s;ary means of education and in&s;truction in the mo&s;t important, u&s;eful and profitable branches of learning. But of what &s;ervice or &s;ignifi|cance are the be&s;t laws, while they lie dor|mant, and may be tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed with impu|nity? A law unexecuted is without life; and can an&s;wer no end, but to bring civil authority into di&s;repute.</P>
<P>As to laws obliging people to a&s;&s;emble for public wor&s;hip, and provide them&s;elves with public teachers of religion; &s;uch laws are evidently well adapted to promote the good order of civil government, and advance the happine&s;s of a people, by enforcing the u&s;e of proper means for impre&s;&s;ing men's minds with an awe of the &s;upreme Governor of the world, and engaging them from a &s;en&s;e of their accountablene&s;s to him, to fulfil all moral obligation, and live in the practice of the virtues of a good life. And it is con|ceived that &s;uch laws can be no rea&s;onable ground of complaint, &s;o long as the &s;acred rights of con&s;cience are &s;ufficiently guarded and &s;ecured, by leaving people at liberty to chu&s;e their own teachers, and modes of worship; and while none are &s;ubjected to
<PB N="47" REF="017899_0046_0FA37C24C0CFEE78">
fines, forfeitures or any di&s;advantages of a civil nature, for their particular religious &s;entiments and profe&s;&s;ion, if they be peace|able members of &s;ociety, and do not pro|pagate any doctrines, incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;afety of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>To carry the idea of religious liberty &s;o far, as to make it an effectual hindrance to the providing and u&s;ing nece&s;&s;ary means, for the pre&s;ervation of a &s;en&s;e of religion and moral obligation among the members of a community, is to oppo&s;e it to the in|tere&s;ts of human &s;ociety, and to rob civil government of one of it's main &s;upports. For the mo&s;t powerful enforcements of obedience to civil authority, are derived from a con&s;ideration and belief, that there is a &s;upreme invi&s;ible Power, pre&s;iding over the world, to whom all men are account|able, and who will reward or puni&s;h every man, in a future &s;tate, <HI>according to his works.</HI> Obedience that proceeds wholly from fear of puni&s;hment from men, is precarious and uncertain; and will be withdrawn, upon the &s;lighte&s;t temptations of plea&s;ure or profit, whenever a per&s;on believes, that he can e&s;cape with impunity. Religion therefore forms a more &s;teady and permanent prin|ciple of obedience to civil government, than
<PB N="48" REF="017899_0047_0FA37C2605F52580">
any penal &s;anctions, of a temporary nature, by which the laws of men can be enforced.</P>
<P>It would evidently conduce greatly to the happine&s;s and tranquility of &s;ociety, and facilitate the admini&s;tration of government and public ju&s;tice, could people, in general, be per&s;uaded to &s;ubmit to the authority of the community, ve&s;ted in it's rulers, and to obey the laws, <HI>not only for wrath, but for con&s;cience &s;ake.</HI> It is not conceivable how any &s;ociety &s;hould enjoy this advantage, where the public wor&s;hip of God is neg|lected, and no proper means made u&s;e of, for the in&s;truction of people in piety, religion and morality.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign of the in&s;titution of civil government being the good of the people, they who are intru&s;ted with the manage|ment of it, &s;hould make this the grand object of their attention and pur&s;uit, and in the exerci&s;e of their con&s;titutional powers, u&s;e all means and methods, that are of manife&s;t importance and nece&s;&s;ity to an&s;wer this end. This will make them a <HI>terror to evil doers,</HI> and an encouragement to them who do well. This will not only command a general reverence; but in&s;ure to them the particular e&s;teem, a&s;&s;i&s;tance and &s;upport of

This will make them public ble&s;&s;ings and benefactors; and give them tho&s;e &s;incere delights and &s;upporting con&s;olations, which ari&s;e from reflections on &s;uch good and u&s;eful actions, as have greatly contributed to the general intere&s;t and pro&s;|perity, and advanced the happine&s;s of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>It might be tho't an inexcu&s;able omi&s;&s;ion, &s;hould I clo&s;e this di&s;cour&s;e, without paying a particular honourable attention to the worthy gentlemen, who have lately been ve&s;ted with the &s;overeign powers of this commonwealth. Their promotion to &s;uch high &s;tations of authority, by the &s;uffrages of a free people, gives them re&s;pectability, and entitles them to our confidence.</P>
<P>It affords us &s;ingular plea&s;ure, that the highe&s;t &s;eat in government, is filled, the fourth time, with a generous, uniform, per|&s;evering and re&s;olute <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">; who has ac|quitted him&s;elf with integrity and honour, in the &s;everal important departments, in which he has been employed, &s;ince the be|ginning of our late conte&s;ts. Nor &s;hall we forget, that for the early decided and di&s;|tingui&s;hing part, which he took, in the cau&s;e
<PB N="50" REF="017899_0049_0FA37C2701256D30">
of his country, he had the honour to be marked out, in conjunction with an eminent compatriot, for the fir&s;t victim of Briti&s;h vengeance. Our &s;atisfaction on account of his being again cho&s;en fir&s;t magi&s;trate of this commonwealth, would be without allay, on this occa&s;ion, was he not prevented, by &s;ick|ne&s;s, from honouring the &s;olemnities of the day with his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>We are happy to find, that the &s;econd rank in government, by the voice of the people, is again conferred on a gentleman, who, by an unwearied inflexible attachment to the cau&s;e of America, through all the hazzardous &s;cenes of the late war, from fir&s;t to la&s;t, has given full proof of his patrioti&s;m, and ju&s;tify merited public re&s;pect and honour.</P>
<P>We rejoice that &s;o many other worthy characters, that have approved them&s;elves fa&s;t friends to their country, in the most perilous times, are intru&s;ted with a &s;hare in the admini&s;tration of government, and the important powers of legi&s;lation.</P>
<P>The te&s;timony, which his Excellency; his Honor, the lieutenant-governor; and the honorable gentlemen, that compo&s;e the two branches of the general court, have received; and which the council, &s;till to be cho&s;en,
<PB N="51" REF="017899_0050_0FA37C27C4B0AF00">
will receive, of the e&s;teem and confidence of the people, by their election to &s;uch high offices; mu&s;t be an encouragement and ani|mating motive to them, to improve the ad|vantages re&s;ulting from their exalted &s;tations, for the good of the public, the end of their advancement. We know that their bu&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t be peculiarly difficult and arduous, at &s;uch a day as this. Until the body politic &s;hall be cured of tho&s;e di&s;tempers and di&s;|orders, which have been introduced by the convul&s;ions of war, it will require great &s;trength and fortitude of mind, to hold the reins, and &s;u&s;tain the burden of government. Great &s;kill and wi&s;dom, great firmne&s;s and re&s;olution tempered with prudence, are nece&s;|&s;ary, at the pre&s;ent cri&s;is; to retrieve public credit; to do equal ju&s;tice to all; to quiet the agitations of people's minds; to put the affairs of the public into a proper train and arrangement; to repair the di&s;orders of the political machine, and adju&s;t the wheels and &s;prings of it, in &s;uch a manner, that every part may an&s;wer its end, and contribute to the beauty, order and u&s;efulne&s;s of the whole. We therefore mo&s;t heartily com|mend our civil fathers to the ble&s;&s;ing of that God, <HI>who giveth wi&s;dom to the wi&s;e, and under&s;tanding to the prudent.</HI> May the legi&s;|lature, and all in authority, from the fir&s;t

<P>And let all people, of every cla&s;s and de|nomination, &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider, how much it behoves them to &s;ubmit to tho&s;e, who are in authority over them, and to conform to the con&s;titution and laws of the common|wealth, in order effectually to &s;ecure the ble&s;&s;ings of civil government. While civil rulers are to be cautioned again&s;t an abu&s;e of authority, and exhorted to employ their powers for the good of the public; people are to be <HI>put in mind</HI> to honour and <HI>obey magi&s;trates</HI>; to be <HI>&s;ubject unto the higher powers,</HI> and to <HI>&s;ubmit them&s;elves to every ordinance of man, for the Lord's &s;ake.</HI></P>
<P>When people give way to a refractory temper; &s;et them&s;eles up in oppo&s;ition to government; and by continual groundle&s;s invectives, endeavour to bring an odium upon their rulers, and upon all public mea|&s;ures; they take a direct method to over|throw ail civil authority, and to di&s;band and aboli&s;h &s;ociety. Let people be vigilant and guarded again&s;t the encroachments of arbi|trary power; but let them, at the &s;ame time, take heed, that they deprive not them&s;elves of the ble&s;&s;ings of good government, and

plunge them&s;elves into all the di&s;orders and mi&s;chiefs of anarchy, in order to &s;ecure them&s;elves again&s;t tyranny. This would be as prepo&s;terous, as for a mariner to &s;uffer voluntary &s;hipwreck upon the rocks of Seilly, in order to avoid the dangers of Charybdis. No wi&s;e man will run into one extreme, in order to avoid its oppo&s;ite, while he can &s;teer &s;afely, in a middle cour&s;e, between both.</P>
<P>Sen&s;ible of the importance of good go|vernment, the true friends of &s;ociety will chearfully &s;ubmit to lawful authority, and endeavour to encourage and &s;upport tho&s;e, who are in public &s;tations, in the execution of their high offices, for the public good. And while they do thus, they will cultivate in them&s;elves and others, tho&s;e benevolent di&s;po&s;itions, and tho&s;e principles of integrity, hone&s;ty and ju&s;tice, which are nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve peace and amity, good humour, order and mutual confidence among neigh|bours and to lay a foundation for tho&s;e pri|vate friend&s;hips, which afford &s;ome of the mo&s;t refined &s;ocial plea&s;ures and delights.</P>
<P>And let it be remembered, that by the virtues of a good life, added to their reli|gious devotions and acts of homage and wor&s;hip, the people put them&s;elves under the protection and patronage, and &s;ecure the
