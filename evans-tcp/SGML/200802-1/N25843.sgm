<HEAD>THE PREFATORY ADDRESS TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>FROM a deep &s;en&s;e of the manifold favors, and repeated ble&s;&s;ings vouch&s;afed to me by Almighty God, in and through his well beloved Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord; and the hope of glory, which I daily experience through the Eternal Spirit, as my comforter and guide&mdash;I am induced to contri|bute all I po&s;&s;ibly can, towards the complete de&s;truction and final overthrow of Anti-Chri&s;t's Kingdom; the plucking out of the &s;nare of the devil tho&s;e who are taken captive by him at his will; pre&s;erving the innocent from &s;in, error and pol|lution; &s;preading the knowledge of the Lord over the whole world, and the teaching men to &s;ee what is the fellow&s;hip of the my&s;tery&mdash;that they may know the love of God; in &s;uch a manner as to e&s;cape the pollutions, &s;ins and follies, of this pre&s;ent evil world, and may be accounted worthy to &s;tand before the Son of Man. I am aware, that reducing the above re&s;olution to practice, will co&s;t me my reputation,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am not in connexion with any body of people, but am in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">rity with all men.</NOTE> if I have any; render me obnoxious to the di&s;plea&s;ure of luke|warm profe&s;&s;ors, and to the &s;coffs, taunts and menaces of the profane: but if they take the liberty to tran&s;gre&s;s the laws of God, unauthorized by him &s;o to do, they mu&s;t not be &s;ur|prized&punc; if I u&s;e the authority wherewith I am legally inve&s;t|ed by God and man, in reproving and bearing te&s;timony again&s;t them, for their &s;in, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and rebellion again&s;t Al|mighty God. If there be any thing laudable in &s;in, (as one might naturally &s;uppo&s;e there is, it being &s;o often committed
<PB N="iv" REF="034372_0003_0FFC3346DE6D7590">
and &s;o much delighted in) men ought not to be offended when they are reproved for it, or charged with committing it&punc; but if it is a di&s;honour to God, and a di&s;grace to human nature, let them be a&s;hamed to commit it, and they will not be reproached by being openly expo&s;ed. But what if the earth be moved? The Lord &s;itteth above the water-floods, and remaineth a King forever. Who art thou? O great mountain! A plain! Being therefore regardle&s;s of con&s;e|quences relative to my&s;elf, and knowing the terror of the Lord, and the dreadful and unhappy &s;tate of the wicked, I think it my mo&s;t bounden and indi&s;pen&s;ible duty, while I am in the body, to &s;tir up your minds by way of remembrance. Le&s;t your &s;trict attention to worldly gain, &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures and earthly delights, &s;hould cau&s;e you totally to lo&s;e &s;ight of eternal and heavenly things; and in con&s;ideration of the worth and value of your immortal &s;ouls, the joys to which you are redeemed, and the danger you are in of being damned, I u&s;e great plainne&s;s of &s;peech, that if po&s;&s;ible, I may be in&s;trumental of provoking you to emulation, or of deterring you from living in the practice of any known &s;in; that you may be led to con&s;ider your way, and to turn your feet unto God's te&s;timonies; that you may be led to con&s;ider you are wrong before it is too late to be &s;et right; and al&s;o, that your blood may not be found on me, through neglect of warning, and admoni&s;hing you faithfully as from the Lord, of your im|pending danger, and the infallible certainty of your utter ruin, de&s;truction and mi&s;ery, if you per&s;evere in &s;inning again&s;t Almighty God, and in running counter to his divine commands. In con&s;equence whereof, I renounce the world, together with its vain pomp and glory; and al&s;o the empty honours, illegal profits, unju&s;t emoluments, deceitful plea|&s;ures and vain delights ari&s;ing from it; being fully convinc|ed, by rea&s;on and experience, that they cannot be admitted without di&s;plea&s;ing God, injuring mankind, and de&s;troying the immortal &s;oul. And he who does not contribute all he po&s;&s;ibly can towards advancing God's glory, in promoting the pre&s;ent and future happine&s;s and &s;alvation of mankind, is a di&s;hone&s;t, deceived and worthle&s;s character. How wretchedly ignorant, and at the &s;ame time blind to his pre|&s;ent
<PB N="V" REF="034372_0004_0FFC33454EF43388">
and eternal intere&s;ts, mu&s;t he be who vainly &s;uppo&s;es that it is not now required of men to live, as did the prophets and apo&s;tles, of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And who, for the &s;ake of being e&s;teemed among men as a peaceable citizen, will out of mere charity, &s;o called, refu&s;e to reprove his neighbour; and, by tacitly conniving at his &s;in, error and folly, &s;uffers him to live and die in his &s;ins, and finally to &s;ink into perdition.</P>
<P>THE following Appeal being levelled at the root of &s;in, and &s;ini&s;ter motives, will not, it is probable, meet the appro|bation but of a few; and as plays, novels, romances, pro|fane &s;ongs, &amp;c. engro&s;s the attention of mo&s;t, whatever would conduce to the reformation of their hearts and lives, will be neglected, as things of an indifferent nature, and con|&s;equently unworthy their notice and attention. But how|ever, I &s;hall hereby ju&s;tify the ways of God to men, through witne&s;&s;ing in God's behalf to &s;inners, that he wills not their de&s;truction: and al&s;o, that he proclaims him&s;elf to be the Lord Jehovah, God, merciful and gracious, pardoning ini|quity, tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and &s;in; and that he endues with power from on high, all tho&s;e who &s;eek him, to keep his command|ments, by not only reproving &s;in and folly, but al&s;o by living &s;uperior to whatever is contrary to God's mo&s;t holy law, or offen&s;ive to his Divine Maje&s;ty. And as I de&s;ire that my good may not be evil &s;poken of, I have written the follow|ing &s;heets by way of an Appeal, which I hope will be ac|companied with a ble&s;&s;ing to every &s;erious and attentive read|er; that all may be merciful, as they hope to obtain mercy from the Lord. A work of this nature has for &s;ome time pa&s;t been deeply impre&s;&s;ed on my mind, and I have been led to think that I could not die in peace if I did not carry it into execution. And let it be noted, (whatever may have been &s;aid to the contrary by malicious and de&s;igning charac|ters) that I have &s;uch an entire aver&s;ion to War, that if the &s;laves could obtain their liberty by it, I would, if po&s;&s;ible, di&s;&s;uade them from it. The kingdom which I contend for is not of this world. Do you not di&s;cern this? If it was, the world would approve of me, for the world loveth its

own; but now the world hateth me becau&s;e I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;tify again&s;t it that its ways are evil. "Away with &s;uch a fellow, it is not fit that he &s;hould live."</P>
<P>I ENTREAT you by all that is great, good, holy, and &s;a|cred, that you examine your&s;elves and prepare for death and judgment, for when I have printed and delivered this to you, I &s;hall be clear of your blood&mdash;I &s;hall trouble you no more for ever! I hope you will not take offence at the plainne&s;s I have u&s;ed in the following &s;heets. Believe me, Sirs, I am no duplex, I do nothing under a cloak, but openly and can|didly expre&s;s my &s;entiments, &s;imply without any degree of guile or mental re&s;ervation whatever, Would not a lawyer merit cen&s;ure from mankind, if he &s;hould prove unfaithful to his client through bribery? or a phy&s;ician fall into di&s;re|pute if he neglected the radical cure of his patient, rather than put him to pain? But what is the lo&s;s of an e&s;tate, or the death of the body, compared with the lo&s;s of heaven and the death of the &s;oul? O Sirs! what would you think of me if I &s;hould cry peace, peace, when God hath not &s;poken peace to your immortal &s;ouls? Would you not &s;ay, at the great and final audit, here is the wretch who &s;oothed us in our &s;ins, who &s;ought not us but ours; who connived at our damnation; who, under the pretence of catching us with guile, has left us &s;ecure in the devil's net? But what more abundantly aggravates our mi&s;ery is, that we mu&s;t behold this deceiver forever in hell. O Sirs! this is not a random no|tion, or a mere "enthu&s;ia&s;tic revery," ari&s;ing from a di&s;or|dered brain; but truth and con&s;i&s;tency, matured by time, and deep meditation! I would have done you this labour of love much &s;ooner if my circum&s;tances had been adequate to it, or if I could have prevailed on any printer to print it; for all men &s;eek their own, and not the things which are Je&s;us Chri&s;t's; and if they can accumulate worldly gain, they are regardle&s;s of the immortal part, they have no notion of &s;a|crificing a le&s;s for a greater good. O Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us! but do not riches make to them&s;elves wings and fly away as an eagle towards hea|ven? Is not the pre&s;ent failure among&s;t the merchants a proof
<PB N="VII" REF="034372_0006_0FFC33402C03BB10">
of it? See their large and exten&s;ive commerce in one hour, or in a very &s;hort &s;pace, brought to nought! Behold, your cities are burnt with fire! and a variety of other afflictions which are as &s;o many loud calls from God to &s;inners, to amend their ways, and to &s;eek happine&s;s in God alone; to lay up trea&s;ure in heaven, where true joys are to be found; where Chri&s;t &s;itteth at the right hand of God, who will render to every man according to his works. O ye unhappy beings! I am &s;orry to &s;ee you expre&s;s &s;uch a rooted and fixed enmity to religion, and religious characters in general; and at me in particular, becau&s;e I entreat you to &s;erve the Lord and &s;ave your &s;ouls, and to do to all men as you would they &s;hould do to you, on change of circum&s;tances! Another day will teach you how incon&s;i&s;tently you have acted. May the Lord grant it may be done before it is too late to re|pent! The Lord knoweth that I earne&s;tly de&s;ire and pray that you may be happy in God through Chri&s;t. I would willingly undergo the greate&s;t hard&s;hips, could I be rendered in&s;trumental of prevailing with you &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider the importance of living and dying. I have not the lea&s;t degree of enmity again&s;t any man; but from the very ground of my heart, freely forgive tho&s;e who have injured me, and would gladly embrace the fir&s;t opportunity to do them good.</P>

It is certain that neither the laws of God, or the na|ture of the con&s;titution, authorize you to do otherwi&s;e by them. Does God e&s;teem men merely for their worldly pomp and grandeur? The rich man, mentioned in the go&s;pel, evinceth the contrary.

I think not.&mdash;How comes it to pa&s;s then that you, after appoint|ing the mini&s;ters their province, undertake to direct them in what manner they &s;hall apply their medicine! And to whom they &s;hall, and to whom they &s;hall not apply it? Pray what do you mean by this conduct? Is it that you will have no mini&s;ters but &s;uch as will &s;uffer them&s;elves to be the mere dupes and tools of your caprice and humour? You may find &s;ome greedy dogs who can never have enough, who will &s;ubmit to you; but true mini&s;|ters of Je&s;us Chri&s;t will not, they have more regard for your &s;ouls than to flatter and deceive you. Is it rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that men who have been commi&s;&s;ioned from the high court of heaven, to preach the everla&s;ting go&s;pel to every creature, will a&s;k your permi&s;&s;ion, when, where, how, and to whom they &s;hall preach it? It is not. For the importance of their &s;ta|tion is by far &s;uperior to that of a king; and if they walk as Chri&s;t walked, &s;eeking the intere&s;t of the Redeemer's kingdom, they are the &s;alt of the earth; but tho&s;e who &s;eek the honour which cometh of men, who are afraid to declare to the people openly and publicly, that unle&s;s they depart from all &s;in and iniquity, and live a life devoted to God, they will peri&s;h, are unwor|thy the name of mini&s;ters. It appears from 2 Cor. chap. 5. that God has committed unto his true and faithful mini&s;ters the mini&s;try of reconcilia|tion. How very important then is their office, and how laudable their un|dertaking. How plea&s;ant and delightful would their tidings be to you if you would exerci&s;e rea&s;on, and humbly and calmly wait on God, until he has filled you with that &s;weet heaven-born peace through Chri&s;t, which they make mention of. Language and expre&s;&s;ion fail to &s;et forth the in|comparable worth and dignity of the Lamb of God, who taketh away the &s;in of the world, and the innate happine&s;s and permanent &s;atisfaction enjoyed by all his true and faithful followers. Has not the Apo&s;tle Paul commanded men to pray every where, lifting up holy hands to God without wrath and doubting? He has. And was he not guided and directed by the &s;pirit of God in what he has enjoined us? He was. I a&s;k then, by what authority do you forbid men to pray every where, or at lea&s;t in their own hou&s;es? Is this true liberty or the quinte&s;&s;ence of popery? Is this man's natural right? Will long prayers, long &s;ermons, and a feigned &s;anctity, ju&s;tify you in oppo&s;|ing the order of God? Be not deceived, God is not mocked, for what|&s;oever &s;eed a man &s;oweth that &s;hall he al&s;o reap. How can you make it appear to be con&s;i&s;tent even with heathen hone&s;ty, much le&s;s with Chri&s;ti|anity, to forbid the free blacks, &amp;c. to a&s;&s;emble together, to pray, and &s;ing prai&s;es to Almighty God?

Do not the free blacks, &amp;c. pay taxes, and al&s;o di&s;charge all other duties and obligations impo&s;ed on them, equally with other men? They do. Why then were they denied the privi|lege of purcha&s;ing the liberty, to &s;ue for their rights, and at the &s;ame time &s;everely threatened, if they &s;hould attempt to a&s;k it in future&mdash;or why may they not a&s;&s;emble together, to wor&s;hip God without mole&s;tation? Is it ei|ther good &s;en&s;e or good policy to deny them this privilege? Will you not, by limiting them in this re&s;pect, cau&s;e them to break forth, and bur&s;t their bonds? See ye to it. Does not the above ari&s;e from ignorance of God and divine things? I think &s;o. For Mr. R&mdash;ge, of Short-&s;treet, came near my window and cur&s;ed me, when I was at prayer! and on a certain evening I went to the Methodi&s;t Church to hear the Rev. Dr. Coke preach, when the Clerk of the Old Church came into the hou&s;e, about half drunk, and &s;aid, he would &s;end the mini&s;ter with all the damned Methodi&s;ts to damnation, &amp;c. I pre&s;ume that the common plea whereupon many ground their argument to &s;upport the Ju&s;tne&s;s of &s;lavery, (viz that through this mean many of them have been converted to Chri&s;tianity) is a mere &s;ubterfuge; for as the &s;laves' conver&s;ion was not their primary motive, however God may have overruled it for the &s;laves' good, the merchandizer in human blood is condemned never|thele&s;s.

It is not believing right only that makes us differ from the devil, but doing right. Chri&s;t went about doing good, &s;eeking to &s;ave the lo&s;t; but &s;atan, as a roaring lion, goeth about &s;eeking whom he may devour: the devil, is orthodox in faith, but de&s;titute of love; and were you as orthodox as &s;atan in the faith, and not imitators of Chri&s;t in love, you are not of God, but of the wicked one.

Are you republicans? God pity you! I would rather be found in the place of an **** than in yours, if you die as you live; and what hope is there but that you will die &s;o? You a&s;k, is &s;lave-holding a &s;oul-damning &s;in? Let the &s;crip|tures decide this que&s;tion. 1 Cor. vi. 9. Know ye not that the unrighteous &s;hall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolators, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abu&s;ers of them&s;elves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extorti|oners &s;hall inherit the kingdom of God. Is not &s;lave-holding both an unrighteous and unju&s;t thing? The hope of unju&s;t men peri&s;heth. Prov. xi. 7. Is it not pregnant with inju&s;tice, extortion, covetou&s;ne&s;s and theft? I think &s;o. It is then infallibly certain (as the &s;criptures cannot be broken) there is no alternative. You mu&s;t either decline it, or be excluded the kingdom of God; except they prefer living with you in bondage to being liberated, then you are free from that con|demnation. Abraham's &s;ervants enjoyed religious privileges equally with his own &s;on. They were not trained up in ig|norance of God, but taught to &s;erve and obey him. Teach your &s;laves to do likewi&s;e. Would it not be advi&s;eable to weigh in the balance of ju&s;tice and equity, the pre&s;ent abject and &s;ervile &s;tate of the poor de&s;pi&s;ed and oppre&s;&s;ed Africans?

living, which every Chri&s;tian ought to be contented with. Godline&s;s with contentment is great gain, for we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out; but where godline&s;s is wanting, there is an aching void in the &s;oul, which (though many things are &s;ub&s;tituted in its &s;tead) nothing can &s;upply. Hence the covetous man trou|bleth his own hou&s;e, is a flat idolator, de&s;troyeth his own &s;oul, and aims (at lea&s;t) at the de&s;truction of others, and final|ly &s;inks into perdition. As you employ over&s;eers to &s;uperin|tend your bu&s;ine&s;s, and to in&s;i&s;t on the &s;laves doing whatever he &s;hall in&s;i&s;t on as a duty incumbent on them to their own|ers. Why do you not employ a good man who, at the &s;ame time might in&s;truct them in their duty to God? Ought not your mini&s;ters to vi&s;it them, to &s;ee that every man has his own wife, and every woman her own hu&s;band? To join them together in holy matrimony. For marriage is honour|able in all&punc; and the bed undefiled, but whore-mongers and adulterers God will judge; whether they are high, or low, rich or poor, white or black, bond or free. For without holine&s;s &s;hall no man &s;ee his face in glory. Some families whom I much e&s;teem, and from whom I have received many favours, have frequently complained of the di&s;hone&s;ty and ingratitude of their &s;laves, in rendering them contempt, ha|tred, and di&s;obedience, in return for their indulgence and kindne&s;s to them. This I know to be truth, and am very &s;orry they are thus perplexed and troubled, in&s;tead of being obeyed, honoured, and e&s;teemed by their &s;ervants; as I be|lieve they are better done by than they could do for them|&s;elves if they were liberated. (It is true there are very few &s;uch in&s;tances!) But it &s;eems that nothing will atone for their being deprived of their natural right. Nature pleads for its own, and will not (in the general) be content without it, though you would give many gifts. The very idea of li|mitation is irk&s;ome to the rational &s;oul. As the Almighty has given us ju&s;t and holy laws, and has capacitated and qua|lified us to keep them; and at the &s;ame time, freedom and liberty to obey or di&s;obey, and to the&s;e has annexed gracious promi&s;es and dreadful threatenings; the former to encourage and &s;timulate to love and obedience, the latter to awe and

deter us from &s;in and di&s;obedience. And that we might not live beneath our privileges on the one hand, and remain igno|rant of our dangers and di&s;advantages on the other, hath (through Chri&s;t) given the Holy Gho&s;t, and a preached go&s;|pel. Would it not be laudable to imitate, and copy, after Jehovah God? The apo&s;tle &s;ays, be ye imitators of God as dear children; which, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, would lead us to put into execution the Declaration of Independance, viz. that liberty is every man's natural and unalienable right; and to in&s;truct all men in the truth, making them acquainted with the laws of God, and with the laws of their country; that whenever they violate them, they may not do it through ignorance; that being convicted of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, they may be ju&s;tly puni&s;hed; and, in con&s;equence of their good de|portment and well regulated life and conver&s;ation, they may be equally e&s;teemed in this world, and al&s;o in the world to come receive the crown of glory that fadeth not away. I fear you have not con&s;idered the dangerous con&s;equences of cow-&s;kin or forced obedience, or you would immediately de|cline it. The only proper method whereby to know what men are, is to treat them as free agents; and whoever fol|lows not this rule, is either ignorant or di&s;hone&s;t; for where there is no &s;timulous to obedience but ignorance, ca&s;tigation, menaces and abu&s;ive language, it forebodes a mo&s;t melan|choly, alarming and dire cata&s;trophe! Here I might (to il|lu&s;trate this awful and tremendous &s;cene) begin with Egypt, where literature fir&s;t flouri&s;hed; and from thence proceed to the Chaldean, Grecian and Roman nations, and even down to individuals; and then inquire, what has been the cau&s;e of the&s;e changes, and of the great deva&s;tation and ruin wrought among them; the an&s;wer would be &s;in!

And re&s;t not &s;atisfied until you know that you are accepted in and through the beloved Je&s;us, until you know that you have redemption through his blood, the forgivene&s;s of all your pa&s;t &s;ins, and have received the Holy Gho&s;t as your comforter and guide, and as the earne&s;t of your eternal inheritance&mdash;that following his guidance, and living a holy and &s;potle&s;s life, and being re|newed in righteou&s;ne&s;s and in true holine&s;s, you may be pre|&s;ented faultle&s;s before the pre&s;ence of his glory with exceed|ing joy, and receive the crown of life&mdash;the &s;entence, Come ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father, and receive the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; when the righte|ous will &s;hine forth as the &s;un in the firmament in the king|dom of their father; where they will behold God in the per&s;on of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, through the countle&s;s ages of eternity; &s;inging prai&s;es to him who liveth forever and ever. O mo&s;t great and glorious God, impart thy &s;overeign aid, to give &s;ucce&s;s to what is here written, con&s;onant to thy mo&s;t holy and &s;acred will, that &s;inners may fear and tremble and turn unto the Lord; and that &s;aints may join with angels in laud|ing th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> great and glorious name at th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> conver&s;ion, through Chri&s;t Je&s;us.

<HEAD>A COPY OF A LETTER.</HEAD>
<P>I ADDRESS you in the name and pre&s;ence of the Eternal Jehovah, who&s;e I am and whom I &s;erve; and before who&s;e bar you and I mu&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> pa&s;s the &s;tricte&s;t &s;crutiny; he will di&s;clo&s;e the &s;ecrets of all hearts, and ren|der to every man according to the deeds done in the body. How wretched then, beyond all conception, mu&s;t he be, who hath &s;hewed no mercy! He &s;hall have judgment without mercy! When the Lord Je&s;us &s;hall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire, taking vengeance on tho&s;e who know not God, and who obey not the go&s;pel of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who &s;hall be puni&s;hed with everla&s;ting de&s;truction from the pre&s;ence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power, when he &s;hall come to be glorified in his &s;aints, and to be admired in all who believe, in that day. It is reported, that you advi&s;ed Old I&s;aac (a &s;lave belonging to Mr&punc; D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ner, a tanner in this city, who was about to be &s;old at vand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, and whom you intended to purcha&s;e) to leave his wife, &s;aying, "never mind your wife, I have plenty of young girls in the country, I will give you one of them for a wife." If the report is true, are you not the man, who, living and dying in your pre&s;ent &s;tate, &s;hall never &s;ee the face of God with comfort? Can you advi&s;e men to leave their wives, and remain guiltle&s;s? No. For he who breaketh the lea&s;t commandment, and teacheth men &s;o, whether by precept or example, the &s;ame &s;hall be called lea&s;t, in the kingdom of heaven, that is, &s;hall have no part therein. Can it po&s;&s;ibly be, that you have wandered &s;o far from the right way, as to advi&s;e a man to leave his wife? Is not your precept herein contrary to our Lord's precept? It is. For our Lord teaches that a man &s;hall leave all his relations and cleave to his wife.&mdash;Can any whore-monger, adulterer, fornicator, un|clean per&s;on, covetous man, or idolator, enter the kingdom of heaven? No. What then will the end be of tho&s;e who advi&s;e men to put away their wives, and take other wives? While you thus act, is not your preaching an abo|mination to the Lord, and is not your prayer turned into &s;in? Unto the wicked, &s;ays God, wherefore do&s;t thou preach my laws, whereas thou hate&s;t to be reformed? Thou art inexcu&s;able, O man! For, while thou teache&s;t &s;ome from the pulpit not to &s;in, thou advi&s;e&s;t others to leave their wives in thy private conver&s;ation with them, and hereby thou tempte&s;t them to com|mit &s;in. Con&s;ider, I pray thee, for a few moments, the importance of thy &s;tation; and the mean, abject, and &s;ervile &s;tate of the poor &s;lave whom thou advi&s;e&s;t to leave his wife; and then contra&s;t the &s;ubject between a learned Doctor, who has had the advantages of a liberal and polite education, and an ignorant &s;lave, who cannot utter a &s;entence of Engli&s;h with any degree of propriety, and you will be led to &s;ee that you have great rea&s;on to be a&s;hamed before Almighty, God, that you have &s;o much abu&s;ed the&s;e great advantages, as to &s;ubject your&s;elf to be thus expo&s;ed, by there proof of a poor, abject slave. It is then infallibly certain, that great learning and &s;uperior advantages only &s;erve to make the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or &s;o much the more like &s;atan, if he is hardened in &s;in, and is not partaker of the Holy Gho&s;t, or does not follow and attend to his dictates. Thus it was with the &s;cribes of old, they de&s;troyed their precept by their ex|ample. Is not he who provides not for his own, e&s;pecially for tho&s;e of his own hou&s;e, wor&s;e than an infidel? And does not this provi&s;ion, copiously con&s;idered, imply training them up in the way they &s;hould go, in the in&s;truc|tion and admonition of the Lord? How then can you e&s;cape the wrath of God, which is revealed from heaven, again&s;t all unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, for confining your slaves to your plantation, &s;uffering them to live in &s;in, and in ignorance, without teaching them to &s;eek and &s;erve the Lord, violating the Lord's day by &s;ervile labour, &amp;c. while you are in the hou&s;e of God, taking the name of God in vain, by &s;aying, Lord have mercy upon us, Chri&s;t have mercy upon us. when you do not the things which he commands you. And though you &s;hould pay tithe of mint, ani&s;e, and cummin, you neglect the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy and faith. You re&s;emble tho&s;e blind guides who &s;train out a gnat and &s;wallow a camel. Tho&s;e who within are full of rapine and intemperance&mdash;tho&s;e who within are full of dead men's bones and all un|cleanne&s;s&mdash;tho&s;e who within are full of hypocri&s;y and iniquity. How exter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s is this character to that of a true mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t&mdash;how contrary to that charity which is the grand characteri&s;tic of a true Chri&s;tian! What if you &s;hould give all your goods to feed the poor, and your body to be burned and remain de&s;titute of charity, divine love to God and man, what will it avail you at the la&s;t and great day, when robed in dreadful maje&s;ty the Judge of all &s;hall come? If you are found to be an unprofitable &s;ervant, you will be ca&s;t into outer darkne&s;s; there &s;hall be weeping and gna&s;hing of teeth. Ha&s;t thou a name that thou live&s;t and art dead? O repent and do thy fir&s;t works, le&s;t God &s;hould remove thee out of time into a tormenting hell! O con&s;ider this, le&s;t God &s;hould pluck thee away, and there be none to deliver thee&punc; That the Lord may ble&s;s this to thy immortal &s;oul is the prayer of thy &s;incere friend, in the bonds of a peaceful go&s;pel.</P>
