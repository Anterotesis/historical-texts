<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is nothing men bear &s;o ill, as to be told with plainne&s;s of their faults, yet there is nothing more nece&s;|&s;ary for them&mdash;Sinners are often offended becau&s;e tho&s;e <HI>who watch for their &s;ouls,</HI> &s;et their danger before them, and thereby di&s;turb them in the way to ruin.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e is &s;imilar with regard to things of a civil nature: when their favorite opinions are contradicted, or refuted, it touches them to the quick.</P>
<P>It is often objected again&s;t the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, if they treat in public upon any thing of a civil nature,
<Q>that they are meddling with what does not concern them; that their bu&s;ine&s;s is to preach the go&s;pel, and not politics.</Q></P>
<P>But when was this objected, unle&s;s the objector's principles or practices had been cen&s;ured? Such In&s;tances are rare indeed. Where this has not been the ca&s;e, 'tis &s;aid,
<Q>the&s;e matters are handled in the &s;cripture, and therefore naturally come under the con&s;ideration of tho&s;e who are &s;et apart to &s;tudy and explain the &s;criptures, and urge the duties therein con|tained;</Q>
but the ca&s;e changes immediately, when their faults are reprehended, and the mini&s;ter is tied up to the go&s;pel doctrines of faith and repentance.&mdash;</P>
<P>But, let men &s;ay what they will, every mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t is bound to preach the whole coun&s;el of God; he never needs a better apology for treating upon any &s;ubject, than that it is treated upon in the word of God: And as matters of a poli|tical nature are to be found in the word of God, to di&s;cour&s;e upon them is &s;ometimes their duty&mdash;and it is e&s;pecially &s;o at this day, in which we are called to contend for our civil rights&mdash; It is now their duty faithfully to warn their hearers of their danger, and &s;eriou&s;ly caution them, to beware of every thing that may be prejudicial to their country's cau&s;e.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="014826_0003_0F973907649C2970">The clergy in general may do much in this way to &s;erve their country, as well as by their prayers&mdash;The author of the following pages, herein attempts to ca&s;t in his mite, to help on the good cau&s;e; which he is re&s;olved to do all the little in his power to a&s;&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>He has u&s;ed plainne&s;s that will doubtle&s;s offend the enemies of American liberty, and perhaps &s;ome of tho&s;e who have in|con&s;iderately acted again&s;t her cleare&s;t intere&s;ts&mdash;He could not expre&s;s him&s;elf with the unfeeling coldne&s;s of a &s;toic, upon matters &s;o important to mankind; in which al&s;o his country is &s;o nearly concerned, nor would he if he could&mdash;<HI>'Tis good to be zealou&s;ly affected always in a good thing.</HI>*</P>
<P>Indifference, at this day, is at be&s;t the badge of &s;tupidity, and frequently of &s;omething wor&s;e; be it of either, their coun|try lothes them, &s;he would <HI>they were either cold or hot;</HI> and if they continue luke-warm, would be happy, could <HI>&s;he &s;pew them out of her mouth.</HI></P>

<P>Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkne&s;s for light, and light for darkne&s;s; that put bitter for &s;weet, and &s;weet for bitter.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHAT we &s;hall attempt from the&s;e words, will be to point out the character of the per&s;ons, again&s;t whom a woe is here denounced; and &s;hew what is im|plied in it.</P>
<P>THE woe is again&s;t tho&s;e who <HI>put evil for good, darkne&s;s for light, and &s;weet for bitter</HI>&mdash;all the&s;e may be done both in a moral and political &s;en&s;e; we &s;hall therefore con&s;ider the words in both the&s;e views&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">I. In a moral&mdash;In this &s;en&s;e nothing is more common than a mi&s;-calling good and evil&mdash;Mankind in general, call this world good, as it &s;tands oppo&s;ed to the kingdom of God&mdash;their conduct &s;hews that they think it good for them to lay up their trea&s;ure here, where every thing is fading, and in a few days mu&s;t vani&s;h away, rather than in heaven, where an inheritance would be durable, and a <HI>good &s;ecurity again&s;t the time to come</HI>&mdash;Here therefore they are <HI>careful, and cumbered about with many things</HI>; but pay little, or no regard to the <HI>one thing needful,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Luke</HI> 10.42.</NOTE> even that <HI>better part which could never be taken from them.</HI></P>
<P>THAN this nothing can be more palpably ab&s;urd&mdash; but a moment's reflection mu&s;t convince the madde&s;t worldling of his folly; and that he herein calls and treats <HI>evil as tho' it were good.</HI> Was the period of his exi&s;tence to end with mortal life, he might ju&s;tify his conduct, in pur&s;uing &s;omething here as his chief good&mdash;tho' even then, the eagerne&s;s with which many pur&s;ue wealth and
<PB N="6" REF="014826_0005_0F97390AF25A6950">
fame, would be folly, being de&s;tructive of pre&s;ent enjoy|ment, which did our being end with this life, would be all the reward of our labor and &s;orrow under the &s;un.</P>
<P>BUT as man is made for another, an eternal world, where he will be happy or mi&s;erable according to his works here in this, 'tis the heighth of madne&s;s to pur&s;ue this world as his chief good, to lay up his trea&s;ure here, and place his affections upon the&s;e fading toys, <HI>all which are to peri&s;h with the u&s;ing.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gal.</HI> 11.22.</NOTE></P>
<P>IF &s;uch be the choice we make, we are always liable to have the very grounds of our happine&s;s taken from us in a moment; and death will certainly <HI>&s;trip us of our ar|mour wherein we tru&s;t,</HI> and turn us more than naked into the other world; it will &s;end us to inherit the fruit of their folly and wickedne&s;s, to &s;uffer the natural and judi|cial con&s;equences of our conduct here, and that forever. <HI>As we brought nothing into this world with us, 'tis certain we can carry nothing out</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1. <HI>Tim.</HI> 6.7.</NOTE>&mdash;<HI>who&s;e then &s;hall the&s;e things be?</HI> <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Luke,</HI> 12.20.</NOTE> If then we have not <HI>laid in &s;tore a good foundation again&s;t the time to come,</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">1. <HI>Tim.</HI> 6.19.</NOTE> we &s;hall be found naked&mdash;If we do not &s;erve God, and provide for our immortal &s;ouls here, we &s;hall have nothing there, but the reward of &s;lothful &s;er|vants, nothing, that is, but endle&s;s mi&s;ery and woe.</P>
<P>If the ca&s;e be &s;o, can any thing be plainer, than that they who call the Earth, or any in it, the chief good, mi&s;|call things, calling that the chief good, which is to them, through their folly, the greate&s;t evil? the &s;ource of end|le&s;s mi&s;ery and eternal ruin?</P>
<P>Now, what the woe is, that belongs to per&s;ons of this character is evident; 'tis the wretchedne&s;s which their conduct naturally draws after it; 'tis the lo&s;s of all hap|pine&s;s and the induction of all mi&s;ery. This is what by their mi&s;-calling and mi&s;-treating matters, they will bring up|on them&s;elves in a future &s;tate! Well may it be &s;aid, <HI>woe be unto them!</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="7" REF="014826_0006_0F97390C47FE3808">II. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of tho&s;e who make the plea|&s;ures of &s;in their chief good; who &s;eek happine&s;s in ways prohibitted by God their maker and &s;overeign, as well as from vain, tran&s;itory objects.&mdash;Of tho&s;e there are not a few in the world: and they are a di&s;tinct cla&s;s from tho&s;e ju&s;t mentioned&mdash;there we intended only tho&s;e who are wedded to the world, and &s;eek happine&s;s in heaping up to them&s;elves, the good things of it; but who take no di&s;|hone&s;t method to attain them.&mdash;</P>
<P>But tho&s;e we now intend, if the world be their idol, &s;tick at no means to attain it&mdash;no laws, human or divine, ob&s;truct them further than to e&s;cape puni&s;hment here&mdash; If it be &s;ome other vicious de&s;ire that predominates in their &s;ouls, every thing is &s;acrificed to the gratification of it.&mdash;In a word: the per&s;ons, we now intend, are &s;uch as roul them&s;elves in the plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e, regardle&s;s of the commands of God, who requires mankind to be holy, &s;e|perate from &s;in, and pay a &s;acred regard to all his laws.&mdash;</P>
<P>In this cla&s;s are to be ranked the thief, the drunkard, the profane, the unclean, the extortioner, &amp;c.&mdash;and how great a part of the world are there, who in &s;ome of the&s;e ways, &s;eek happine&s;s? All which, contemn the divine authority, and al&s;o the rules and directions of eternal wi&s;dom, which has &s;o ordered the&s;e matters, that men are in reality re&s;trained, only from tho&s;e gratifications, which tend to mi&s;ery even here, was there no hereafter&mdash;Was theft, drunkenne&s;s, &amp;c. allowed by God, every one mu&s;t &s;ee that the happine&s;s of the world, would forbid &s;uch indulgences; and that the liberty would only be a liberty to be unhappy.&mdash;</P>
<P>If &s;o, nothing can be more evident, than that they who call the&s;e gratifications good, and in the&s;e ways &s;eek hap|pine&s;s, in preference to the rules which God has given to &s;eek it by, do in truth, <HI>call evil good</HI>&mdash;and the woe that be|longs to them is evidently, the lo&s;s of that felicity which is re&s;erved for the obedient, and their being doomed to

<P N="3">III. There is al&s;o a woe denounced again&s;t tho&s;e who, <HI>put darkne&s;s for light, and light for darkne&s;s</HI>&mdash;this again is what many do in a religious, or moral &s;en&s;e&mdash;'tis done by all, who &s;et up their own under&s;tandings as a &s;urer guide to happine&s;s than the word of God; or who think their own rational powers, &s;ufficient to lead them in the way to life, without any &s;upernatural revelation&mdash;&s;uch reject, or at lea&s;t neglect, <HI>that &s;ure word of prophe&s;y, that &s;hines a light in a dark place,</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.19.</NOTE> and tru&s;t, by tho&s;e gifts alone, which enlightened by the word of God would be a &s;ure guide to glory, to feel out their way in darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>There are others who leave the real light of the word, to tru&s;t to that which is imaginary, which they call by the name of &s;piritual or divine light.&mdash;There are many &s;pirits gone abroad into the world, and we are command|ed <HI>to try them,</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>John</HI> 4.1.</NOTE> <HI>whether they be of God.</HI>&mdash;Now, what rule of trial have we, be&s;ide the word? We have none, that is &s;ure, or &s;o much as probable; &s;o that they who leave the word, and take any thing el&s;e for their guide, are li|able to be &s;educed by fal&s;e &s;pirits&mdash;to be decoyed and led a&s;tray by fal&s;e lights, if they de&s;erve that name, which lead men into error and down to ruin; which is generally the unhappy lot of tho&s;e who leave the word.</P>
<P>Men of this ca&s;t, profe&s;s a va&s;t deal of light, and are ready to upbraid all who tru&s;t the word, as ignorant, blind, and knowing nothing&mdash;This, however, makes no alteration in the nature of things; they who keep to
<PB N="9" REF="014826_0008_0F97390F1D9810A8">
the word, keep to the light, after all; while the&s;e enligh|tened ones are <HI>in darkne&s;s, even until now</HI>: they have left the true light to follow an <HI>ignis fatuus</HI>&mdash;their religion is fancical&mdash;they mi&s;take the impul&s;es of a wild, warm imagination, for the &s;ugge&s;tions of the &s;pirit of God; nor do they di&s;cern the impo&s;ture, tho' thereby directed to the mo&s;t glaring ab&s;urdities.</P>
<P>It will be of little &s;ervice to tho&s;e, who have an ima|ginary light &s;uperior to the &s;cripture, to &s;hew from them that tho&s;e who leave them, or &s;ub&s;titute any thing in&s;tead of the plain gramatical &s;en&s;e of them, have for&s;aken the only &s;ure guide; but others perhaps it may profit&mdash;and full to this purpo&s;e are tho&s;e words of the prophet, <HI>To the law and to the te&s;timony: if they &s;peak not according to this word, it is becau&s;e there is no light in them.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>I&s;a.</HI> 8.20.</NOTE> Tho&s;e al&s;o of St. Paul, <HI>If any man teach otherwi&s;e, and con&s;ent not to whole&s;ome words, even the words of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, he is proud, knowing nothing.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1. <HI>Tim.</HI> 6.3, 4.</NOTE></P>
<P>What the woe that is like to fall upon them is, will appear, if it be con&s;idered, that &s;atan rules in the <HI>children of di&s;obedience,</HI> by blinding their minds: he could not hold them pri&s;oners as he does, and lead them about at plea&s;ure, if he did not fir&s;t put out their eyes, &s;o that they &s;ee not who&s;e &s;ervice they are engaged in, or what the con&s;equence of their continuing to &s;erve him will be&mdash;while on the contrary, Chri&s;t leads men in the way of life, by enlight|ening the eyes of their under&s;tandings with the word,&mdash; &s;o that the woe that will fall upon tho&s;e who thus <HI>put darkne&s;s for light,</HI> will be their having their lot with him they &s;erve; for it is as true of his, as of Chri&s;t's &s;ervants, where their ma&s;ter is, <HI>there &s;hall they al&s;o be,</HI> and this &s;hall be their reward.&mdash;</P>
<P>As it is happine&s;s that mankind are in que&s;t of, and in all their choices and pur&s;uits &s;eeking after, 'tis obvious, that all tho&s;e who have been mentioned (viz. <HI>tho&s;e who
<PB N="10" REF="014826_0009_0F97391008B7B468">
call evil good, and put darkne&s;s for light) do really put bitter for &s;weet</HI>&mdash;they make &s;uch choices and go into &s;uch ways, in hopes to find plea&s;ure; but the <HI>end thereof will be as a very bitter day,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Amos</HI> 8.10.</NOTE> 'twill be as wormwood and gall&mdash;now they may &s;hut their eyes again&s;t the light and refu&s;e con|viction; but the day is coming when they can &s;hut their eyes no longer; the light will break in upon them, and convince them of the folly of their conduct to their eter|nal di&s;appointment.&mdash;</P>
<P>But let us,</P>
<P N="2">II. Con&s;ider the text in a political view, for men may <HI>call evil good, and put darkne&s;s for light</HI> in a political as well as moral &s;en&s;e: 'tis oft times actually done, of which our own times are a witne&s;s.&mdash;</P>

'Tis he that calls for judgments and inflicts them, when the &s;tate of the world and his glory requires it&mdash;It is he that rai&s;es up tyrants and oppre&s;&s;ors, and that cru&s;hes them again in a moment, and gives his people re&s;t, when he &s;ees be&s;t&mdash;His purpo&s;es will &s;tand, and <HI>the thoughts of his heart unto all generations</HI>:<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>P&s;al.</HI> 33.11.</NOTE> There is none that can alter the thing which he determines &s;hall be done.&mdash;If any then <HI>tru&s;t to the multitude of an ho&s;t,</HI> or to the &s;trength of the hor&s;e, or the martial prowe&s;s of his rider, they tru&s;t to what cannot &s;ave or deliver.
