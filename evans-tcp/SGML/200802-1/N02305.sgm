<P>THIS Book contains the hi&s;tory of <HI>Jo&s;hua'</HI>s Reign &amp; Govern|ment, whom, after the Death of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> God made Chief Captain of I&s;rael, to conduct them into the Land of <HI>Cana|an,</HI> at once to fulfil the many Promi&s;es made to <HI>Abraham</HI> to <HI>I&s;aac</HI> and to <HI>Jacob,</HI> that their <HI>Seed</HI> &s;hou'd inherit the Land of the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> and to Execute the Cur&s;e on <HI>Canaan,</HI> which <HI>Noah</HI> by a Prophetick Spirit uttered again&s;t him, on occa&s;ion of <HI>Ham'</HI>s imprudence, irre|verence and impudence, in di&s;covering his

<P>And in this Chapter we &s;hall Ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That Jo&s;hua is Divinely called to the Go|vernment.</HI> Mo&s;es the Servant of the Lord was dead, and God appoints Jo&s;hua to &s;tand up in his &s;tead, and Lead His People over Jordan; and encourages him with gracious Promi&s;es of A&s;&s;i&s;tance &amp; Succe&s;s, from the 1<HI>st.</HI> to the 10<HI>th.</HI> Ver&s;e.

God's Word; and tacitly Exhort him to keep him&s;elf in a capacity of God's continu|al A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P N="1">[1.] <HI>They gratefully acknowledge the Ble&s;&s;ing they had in Mo&s;es:</HI> That he was a man that had much of the Pre&s;ence of God with him in his Publick Admini&s;trations; and there|fore their Obedience unto him was not Un|merited. They expre&s;s their Piety to GOD, &amp; their Regards to <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> They a&s;cribe the Glory of all the great things done for them by the hand of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> unto GOD. It was His Pre&s;ence with <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> which was the chief Cau&s;e of all the many worthy Deeds that had been done for them, by him; And they remember <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> as a Man greatly owned of GOD in his Place and favoured much with the Divine Pre&s;ence in his Conduct.</P>
<P N="2">[2] <HI>They put Re&s;pect upon Jo&s;hua, wi&s;hing the ble&s;&s;ing of his Predece&s;&s;or might come upon him:</HI> As they purpo&s;ed to pay the like Obedience to him which they gave to <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> They had changed their Ruler, but were concerned that they might not lo&s;e that which had been the beauty and the &s;trength of their Government, <ABBR><HI>viz</HI></ABBR> the Pre&s;ence of GOD with their Ruler: and therefore pray that the Spirit of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> might re&s;t in a double portion upon <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> and that the &s;ame GOD that

had helped <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> all his Days, would carry <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> well through all his Work.</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> As Gratitude to the Father of Lights from whom comes every good &amp; perfect gift, obliges us not to be wanting, in paying all due Regards to the memory of the Dead, that have been eminently U&s;eful &amp; Services able among us in Publick Capacities, &s;o nei|ther &s;hould we forget to Honour the Living that &s;ucceed them in their Characters and Labours. The I&s;raelites make honourable Mention of decea&s;ed <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and pay a due Deference unto &s;ucceeding <HI>Jo&s;hua.</HI></P>
<P>But our Pre&s;ent work is to Clear and Im|prove the following</P>
<P><LABEL>DOCTRINE.</LABEL>
<HI>It is much to be de&s;ired that Civil Rulers may have much of the Pre&s;ence of GOD with them.</HI></P>
<P>This was it upon which the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> &s;o highly Valued <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> and it &s;eems to have been a pro&s;pect of this that made them &s;o chearful and full in their Promi&s;es unto <HI>Jo&s;hua.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That they may be well fitted for the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Government;</HI> which calls for no &s;mall Ac|compli&s;hments to reach the Ends thereof&punc; Which as they are of grand Importance unto

And the Bonds whereby Societies are held together, the Ca&s;es whereby they are weakned in any of the&s;e great Intere&s;ts, and the Remedies whereby they are re&s;tored, are things that lie out of the &s;ight and reach of Ordinary Abilities. It mu&s;t be the Pre&s;ence of GOD in an Un|common mea&s;ure that mu&s;t make men meet for &s;uch Undertakings. We &s;hould all be <HI>Pares Negotiis,</HI> a Match for our Work. And therefore when God did more immediately call any to &s;erve Him&s;elf and their Genera|tions in &s;uch a way, either they were men whom He had before prepared by &s;uitable Endowments for &s;uch Work, as He did <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &amp; <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> or He did then more immediately Gift them to His Service; as in <HI>Saul'</HI>s ca&s;e, to whom, after he was anointed by <HI>Samuel</HI> to be Captain over God's Inheritance, GOD gave another heart, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 10 9 Not a new heart, but a <HI>Princely &s;pirit</HI> &amp; Endowments for Go|vernment&punc;

And when God gives leave to us to choo&s;e Rulers for our &s;elves, He limits our Choice to &s;uch as He hath already Gifted &amp; Prepared. Agreeable therefore to the Divine Will, was the Coun&s;el of <HI>Jethro</HI> to <HI>Mo&s;es, Exod.</HI> 18. 21. That he &s;hould provide out of all the People, able men, &s;uch as feared God, acted truly &amp; hated Covetou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;et them over the People. And when God, pur&s;uant to this Coun&s;el by <HI>Jethro,</HI> gave <HI>Mo|&s;es</HI> the <HI>Sanhedrim</HI> for his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, He or|dered <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> (Numb. 11. 16.) to gather unto him Seventy men of the Elders of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> whom he knew to be the Elders of the Peo|ple: <HI>To &s;elect out of the Elders of I&s;rael Seventy of the mo&s;t approved Abilities,</HI> to help him bear his Burden.

<P N="2">2. <HI>That they may be well &s;pirited to their Work.</HI> And indeed this is of main Con&s;ideration in this affair, that &s;uch as are concerned in the Government of a People, &s;hould have a kind|ly di&s;po&s;ition to the Duties of it. It is the Apo&s;tle's Command, <HI>Rom.</HI> 12. 11. That we be not &s;lothful in Bu&s;ine&s;s, <HI>but</HI> fervent in &s;pirit &s;erving the Lord. And our Zeal &s;hould bear a proportion to the Service we have to do for GOD. Civil Rulers then &s;hould be men warmly affected to the Pub|lick Good, and in good earne&s;t to approve them&s;elves Benefactors to mankind. It is for this end Government is ordained. Rom. 13. 4. <HI>He is the mini&s;ter of God to thee for good.</HI> And the Ruler, who&s;e heart is right with God, will &s;et him&s;elf to devi&s;e liberal things for the good of a People; and &s;pare no Pains, nor leave any Stone unturned to advance the Publick Intere&s;t. He will labour to draw others into the Paths of Vertue &amp; Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, by going before them in a bright Example; and will be very careful that there be nothing in his Conver&s;ation that may be a Stumbling-block to others, or an occa&s;ion of Sin. If he have Power thereunto, he will
<PB N="10" REF="002741_0008_0FE61D842855F938">
gladly help forward the Enacting of good Laws, however he will do what in him lies, to keep up the Credit of &s;uch good Laws as are Enacted for the Bani&s;hing Wickedne&s;s out of the Land, and the Advancing Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s and Religion, that they may not Sink into Contempt and become Enervated. He will Faithfully Execute Judgment on Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, and in his Zeal will &s;ay with upright David, P&s;al. 101. 8. <HI>I will Early de|&s;troy all the Wicked of the Land: that I may cut off all Wicked doers from the City of the Lord.</HI> His Influences on others will be not a little conducive to their good Behaviour. Much Good will be done by him thro' his Counte|nancing, and Be&s;towing marks of his Favour, on them that are found in the ways of well doing. And his frowns will weaken the hands of the Wicked, that they may turn from their Evil way. He will not only En|deavour to do Good him&s;elf, but will help forward and encourage others in being Pub|lickly Serviceable. So did <HI>Hezekiah</HI> who &s;pake Comfortably to the <HI>Levites</HI> that taught the good Knowledge of the LORD. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 30. 22.</P>

<P>And now I mu&s;t turn my &s;elf more parti|cularly to the Honourable the GOVER|NOUR, the DEPUTY-Governour, &amp; the Wor&s;hipful ASSISTANTS of this Colony.

<P>This Government hath been ble&s;s'd with very Valuable Privileges and a Succe&s;&s;ion of Men, to admini&s;ter their Publick Affairs, of great Worth; who having &s;erved their Ge|nerations Faithfully, are fallen a&s;leep. But the Hand of GOD hath been heavy up|on us of late in the early Removal of many of tho&s;e who were Pillars among us, Men of ap|proved Ability's &amp; Integrity, whom we Lov|ed and Honoured, but called off from their Work, while in their full Strength, &amp; in the heighth of their Improvement. The Wi&s;dom Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Sovereignty of an Holy GOD is Adorable, &amp; to be Submitted to with all Pro&s;tration, in the&s;e Di&s;pen&s;ations of his

Providence, but more e&s;pecially in the Death of the late Governour (which I hope it is not altogether un&s;ea&s;onable to mention, al|tho' he Decea&s;ed not in the Year pa&s;t) The <HI>Jews</HI> long Lamented the Death of good <HI>Jo&s;iah,</HI> and made honourable mention of him in all their Publick Mournings for many Years; and <HI>Jeremiah</HI> the Prophet made it an Ordinance that they &s;hould do &s;o, 2 <HI>Chron</HI> 35. 25.

He was then a Man of the brighte&s;t Accompli&s;hments, whom GOD had Adorned with &s;o many Gifts and Endowments &amp; in &s;o Eminent a Degree, as rendred him like <HI>Saul</HI> taller than his Brethren by the Head &amp; Shoulders, &amp; made him Famous in both <HI>Eng|lands.</HI> The&s;e Excellencies that in others ex|i&s;t &s;eperate, in him were conjoyned. Rea|dine&s;s of Tho't and Solidity of Judgment; Strength of Rea&s;on and Elegancy of Style: Warmth &amp; Activity of Temper &amp; yet a great Command of his own Spirit. His Wi&s;dom &amp; Prudence, his Piety &amp; Probity, his Fidelity

&amp; Con&s;tancy, rendred him our Safety abroad and Strength at home. He was indeed, <HI>Et Prae&s;idium &amp; dulce decus no&s;trum,</HI> Our Chariots &amp; our Hor&s;emen.</P>
<P>His Concern for the <HI>Hou&s;e of GOD,</HI> in bringing about the E&s;tabli&s;hment of our Churches by a Law; and &s;o taking them into his own Arms and placing them under the Paternal Care &amp; Protection of the Govern|ment. His Love to our <HI>School of the Prophets</HI> &amp; promoting the Welfare thereof with heart &amp; hand; and eminent Appearing in a diffi|cult Day for the help both of It and our Churches, ought never to be forgotten; Nor his con&s;tant &amp; growing Zeal for the <HI>Go&s;pel|lizing the Poor Heathen,</HI> to whom we have been &s;o long Neighbours, but too regardle&s;s of their Souls.</P>
<P>He was taken from us as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> from <HI>I&s;rael</HI> when his Eye was not dim, nor his Natural force abated, and left us to Sigh out our Sor|rows in the words of the Lamenting Prophet, Lam 5. 16. <HI>The Crown is fallen from our Head: We unto us that we have Sinned.</HI></P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s we Ble&s;s GOD, that altho' <HI>this &s;trong Rod</HI> be broken, yet we are not redu|ced to the Prophets Complaint, that there are no Strong Rods for a Scepter to rule. May the GOD of the Spirits of all Fle&s;h, that hath &s;et you over this His Congregation, take of

His Spirit and put it, in &s;till more Plentiful mea&s;ures, upon you. And as the I&s;raelites carried it better under <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> than under <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> So may you always find us le&s;s que|rulous &amp; murmuring, more Tractable and Dutiful than we have been heretofore.</P>
<P>Second Branch of the Exhortation.</P>
<P>II. And now let me offer a word of Ad|vice to the BODY OF THIS PEOPLE; <HI>Do what in you lies that you may always have &s;uch to Rule over you, as GOD will delight to be with &amp; Ble&s;s in their great &amp; Good Service for you.</HI> Upon this depends all the Good Fruit of Government. Rulers will be unto you what GOD &s;hall be Plea&s;ed to make them. If they be under a Wi&s;e &amp; Good Conduct, and Succeeded in their way, we &s;hall reap the Benefit; but if their Wi&s;dom peri&s;h &amp; their Coun&s;el &amp; Endeavours for us come to nought, we &s;hall be the Sufferers. How much doth it Concern us then to Labour in this matter? It is this mu&s;t make us an Happy People, and our State Pro&s;perous. The Common Wealth, the Publick Good can't flouri&s;h but under a Wi&s;e &amp; good Admini&s;tra|tion. If any think this not material, and thro' weakne&s;s or wickedne&s;s, de&s;pi&s;e &amp; hate <HI>Knowlege &amp; Wi&s;dom</HI> in them that bear Rule,

<P>And altho' GOD be Sovereign of His Fa|vours, and di&s;pen&s;e them unto whom and when He will; Neverthele&s;s there are Cour&s;es for us to take, that lead to our good herein, and we may contribute much to this matter. And there are ways which if we take, will cut off all rea&s;onable Expectations of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Let all that are concerned to Elect Per&s;ons to Places of Tru&s;t and Government, aim at this in their Choice.</HI> And be not Governed by any Sini&s;ter Views. Be under the influence of this and not of any hurtful Lu&s;ts in giving in your Suffrages. The ca&s;e of man is deplo|rable, in his fallen State, that he can hardly

The Love of the World is always Enmity again&s;t GOD, and tho&s;e Per&s;ons and De&s;igns that mo&s;t of all Honour Him.

A Licentious Spirit, that hates to be Controuled, will be for &s;uch to Rule, as are lea&s;t Able, or may be likely to be lea&s;t Faithful to re&s;train them in their ill Practi&s;es. But let your Eyes be on the A|ble and the Faithful of the Land; and look out men of Renown, known in your Tribes, whom GOD hath Exalted by His Gifts, and Promote them by your Election. You mu&s;t not dictate to the Mo&s;t High, and &s;ay He
