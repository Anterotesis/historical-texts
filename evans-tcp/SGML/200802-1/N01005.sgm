concern for tho&s;e who have called me to this Service, with freedom and plain|ne&s;s. I know that Per&s;ons of <HI>Military Di&s;po&s;ition,</HI> are for engaging in the mo&s;t Noble, and honourable atchievements; but I mu&s;t let them know that &s;uch may be corrupted by <HI>Flattery,</HI> to &s;erve the wor&s;t of intere&s;ts; tho&s;e who are be&s;t furni&s;hed with Arms, and skill to u&s;e them, if corrupted by <HI>Flattery,</HI> will en|gage with the <HI>vile&s;t of men</HI> to promote their wicked de&s;igns: It is the know|ledge of God that will &s;ecure from the guile, fraud, deceit, and flattery of de|&s;igning men; and fortify the mind to the mo&s;t noble <HI>exploits.</HI> It is obvious in our context, that one man by <HI>Flattery</HI> did prevail to overthrow the Religion, and liberty of the only profe&s;&s;ing Peo|ple of God that day on the earth; but tho&s;e that <HI>know their God,</HI> (and continu|ed &s;tedfa&s;t in his Covenant) &s;topped the carreer of the enemy, and by noble exploits prevailed to recover both; an account of which we have in the books of the <HI>Maccabees.</HI></P>

<P>This <HI>Antiochus</HI> finding the methods of guile, flattery, and deceit &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, endeavoured by the like artifices, to add <HI>Egypt</HI> to his Territories, and in time of peace he entered into their Provinces, and obtained a va&s;t trea&s;ure, which he di&s;tributed among his confidents to &s;e|cure them to him&s;elf, and then made further attempts by open force, as ex|pre&s;&s;ed, <HI>v.</HI> 24, 25.</P>

<P>In the Words of our Text, (1.) We have an account of the method he took to obtain his end with lea&s;t hazard, and that was his old, approved way of Flat|tery; <HI>viz.</HI> colouring over his wicked de&s;ignes by &s;pecious pretences; and pro|po&s;ing to them many advantages, if they would joyn with him.</P>
<P>(2.)

<P>(3.) The &s;ucce&s;s he had herein, &s;uch wicked ones (who appeared to be the <HI>Many, v.</HI> 34.) did he <HI>corrupt by flattery:</HI> it &s;eems that &s;ome leading men, (&s;uch as <HI>Ja&s;on</HI> before mentioned) had a great in|fluence to gain over many to their party.</P>
<P>(4.) But then we have in our Text the character of another &s;ort of per&s;ons among the <HI>Jews,</HI> whom he could nei|ther gain by flattery, nor overcome by force; <HI>viz.</HI> &s;uch as <HI>knew their God;</HI> who being the oppo&s;ites to tho&s;e that <HI>dealt wickedly again&s;t the Covenant,</HI> we may thus de&s;cribe; they were &s;uch, who having the knowledge of God as their God in Covenant, cho&s;e him for their portion, tru&s;ted in him for their defence, and cleaved to him with full purpo&s;e of heart, notwith&s;tanding the di&s;tre&s;&s;es they were expo&s;ed unto, for being &s;tedfa&s;t in his Covenant.</P>

An account of the&s;e exploits we have in the books of the <HI>Maccabees.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Doctrine</HI> to be in&s;i&s;ted on from the Words, is,
<Q>The True Knowledge of God will &s;ecure from Flattery, and influence to mo&s;t noble ex|ploits, while prophane Profe&s;&s;ors are corrup|ted to &s;erve the wor&s;t of intere&s;ts.</Q></P>
<P>It is agreed by Expo&s;itors that this <HI>An|tiochus</HI> was a Type of <HI>Antichri&s;t,</HI> and the latter part of the Chapter doth manife&s;t it; now we know from 2 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 2.9, 10. That his coming is <HI>after the working of Satan, with all power, &s;ignes, and lying won|ders: and with all deceivablene&s;s of unrighte|ou&s;ne&s;s in them that peri&s;h: becau&s;e they re|ceived

not the love of the Truth that they might be Saved: And for this cau&s;e God &s;hall &s;end them &s;trong Delu&s;ions that they &s;hould be|lieve a Lye: that they all might be Damned, who believed not the truth, but had plea&s;ure in unrighteoa&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Antichri&s;t</HI> hath obtained his va&s;t Em|pire by Deceit, Guile, Hypocri&s;y, and Di&s;&s;imulation; &amp; hath in &s;everal Ages, <HI>Corrupted by Flatteries</HI> multitudes of pro|phane Profe&s;&s;ors, who have believed his Lyes; and joyned with him, and his &s;up|porters in perpretating the greate&s;t Bar|barities, and Cruelties under pretences of Religion; thinking they did God &s;er|vice when they killed his Children.</P>
<P>During this Reign of <HI>Antichri&s;t,</HI> tho&s;e who <HI>knew their God</HI> have either <HI>Overcome, by the blood of the Lamb, &amp; the word of their Te&s;timony, not loving their lives to the death,</HI> Rev. 12.11.

<P>The Doctrine may be Cleared, and Proved by the following Propo&s;itions.</P>
<P><HI>PROP.</HI> I. That the malice of wicked men, is in e&s;pecial manner &s;et again&s;t the <HI>Holy Covenant of God.</HI> It is &s;aid of <HI>Antiochus,</HI> ver. 28. his <HI>heart &s;hall be again&s;t the Holy Covenant;</HI> and ver. 30. he <HI>&s;hall have Indig|nation again&s;t the Holy Covenant;</HI> which Expre&s;&s;ions import <HI>Malice propen&s;e,</HI> at la&s;t breaking forth with rage and fury. With this rage of <HI>Antiochus,</HI> we may compare, <HI>Rev.</HI> 11.17. where it is &s;aid of the Anti|chri&s;tian intere&s;t, (as under the influ|ence of the Dragon) that he was <HI>wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her Seed, which keep the Com|mandments of God, and have the Te&s;timony of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Holy Covenant</HI> mentioned in
<PB N="9" REF="001202_0010_0FB12F26206EE6F8">
our Text, and Context comprehends,</P>
<P N="1">1. All the Holy <HI>Ordinances,</HI> and <HI>In&s;ti|tutions</HI> of Divine wor&s;hip which God re|quired of his <HI>Saints</HI> who had made <HI>Co|venant with him by Sacrifice,</HI> P&s;al. 50.5. This is evident from ver. 31. And <HI>they &s;hall pollute the Sanctuary of &s;trength, &amp; &s;hall take away the daily Sacrifice</HI>: And the rea|&s;on of their malice is intimated in the la&s;t clau&s;e of the ver&s;e; <HI>And they &s;hall place the abomination that maketh de&s;olate:</HI> That is, they polluted the Temple, and took away the daily Sacrifice; that they might advance their own Idolatrous Wor&s;hip in the room thereof.</P>
<P>So under the New Te&s;tament admi|ni&s;tration, the malice of the Antichri&s;tian intere&s;t is again&s;t tho&s;e that <HI>keep the Com|mandments of God, and have the Te&s;timony of Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> on account of their ad|hering to his holy In&s;titutions according to the Scripture of Truth; that &s;o they may advance their own Super&s;tition and Idolatry.</P>
<P N="2">2. The per&s;ons of tho&s;e that are &s;ted|fa&s;t in the Holy Covenant, comprehen|ding withall, their Liberties, Priviledges, E&s;tates, &amp; whatever el&s;e is dear to them

in this world, as far as they come with|in their reach. Ver. 33. <HI>They &s;hall fall by the Sword, and by Flame, by Captivity, and by Spoil many dayes.</HI> So as to Antichri&s;t, Rev. 13.7. he <HI>&s;hall make war with the Saints, and overcome them.</HI> And, ver. 17. <HI>&s;hall cau&s;e that no man might buy or &s;ell, &s;ave he that hath the Mark, or the Name of the Bea&s;t, or the Number of his Name.</HI> The&s;e both are comprehended, in Dan. 7.25. <HI>And he &s;hall &s;peak great words again&s;t the mo&s;t high, &amp; &s;hall wear out the Saints of the mo&s;t high, &amp; think to change Times, &amp; Laws; &amp; they &s;hall be given into his hand, until a Time, &amp; Times, &amp; the dividing of Time:</HI> that is, Twelve Hundred and Sixty Years.</P>
<P><HI>PROP.</HI> II. That wicked men, in order to accompli&s;h their de&s;igns again&s;t the Wor&s;hip, and People of God, u&s;ually make u&s;e of Guile, Fraud, Deceit, and <HI>Flattery.</HI></P>
<P>For the proving of this Propo&s;ition, I &s;hall offer the following rea&s;ons to Con|&s;ideration.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Satan</HI> who hath in all ages had his influence on all the de&s;igns of wicked men, again&s;t the Wor&s;hip and People of God, puts them on the u&s;e of this me|thod, Rev. 12.9. <HI>The great Dragon, the old
<PB N="11" REF="001202_0012_0FB12F2914D35838">
Serpent called the Devil and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world.</HI> He is a <HI>Mur|therer</HI> from the beginning; he is a <HI>Liar,</HI> and the Father of it, he obtained his fir&s;t Victory over mankind by <HI>Guile</HI>: 2 Cor. 11.3. <HI>He beguiled Eve,</HI> flattering her with hopes of bettering her condition, Gen. 3.4, 5. And <HI>the Serpent &s;aid unto the woman, Ye &s;hall not &s;urely dye; for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your Eyes &s;hall be opened, and ye &s;hall be as Gods, knowing Good and Evil.</HI> And we know from 2 The&s;. 2.9, 10. That <HI>Antichri&s;ts coming</HI> is after the <HI>working of Satan, with all power, &amp; &s;igns, and lying wonders, and with all deceivablene&s;s of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> Rev. 13.13, 14. He doth <HI>great wonders</HI> &amp;c. <HI>&amp; deceiveth them that dwell on the earth.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. As <HI>Flattery</HI> is an old, approved, and &s;ucce&s;sful method, &s;o it is apt to produce the de&s;ired effects, e&s;pecially on the un|wary multitude: We read of &s;ome <HI>Rom.</HI> 16.18. <HI>Who by good words, and fair &s;peeches deceive the hearts of the &s;imple,</HI> who as <HI>Solo|mon</HI> ob&s;erved, <HI>Believe every word,</HI> Prov. 14.15.</P>
<P>The aptne&s;s of <HI>Flattery</HI> thus to gain on the hearts of men, appears, (1.) In that
<PB N="12" REF="001202_0013_0FB12F2A8CC4B510">
there is in <HI>Flattery</HI> a &s;hew of <HI>Love,</HI> friend|&s;hip, and good will, which is very en|gaging and obliging. Thus <HI>Ab&s;alom,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 15.2, 3, 4, 5, 6. By his <HI>ki&s;&s;ing</HI> of the People, &amp; pretending to do them <HI>Ju&s;tice &s;tole the hearts of the people</HI> from his Father <HI>David,</HI> to &s;erve his own abmitious de|&s;ignes. (2.) This method takes per&s;ons from their <HI>Watch,</HI> their <HI>guard,</HI> and lulls them into a &s;ecurity: Where can we &s;leep more &s;ecure, than in the embraces of tho&s;e, that promi&s;e to nouri&s;h, cheri&s;h, and protect us? (3.) This method hath lea&s;t of hazard to tho&s;e that u&s;e it; <HI>An|tiochus</HI> found it a great deal ea&s;ier to <HI>ob|tain the Kingdom by flatteries,</HI> than by Swords and Spears: when tis known that men de&s;ign mi&s;chief, tho&s;e that &s;ee their danger, are awakened to oppo&s;e force, with force: and though tis often that the weake&s;t go by the Walls, yet there is a hazard; but good words, fair &s;pee|ches, titles of honour, and now &amp; then a &s;mall gift to encourage hopes, when the de&s;ignes are accompli&s;hed, the&s;e are a <HI>cheap Barter,</HI> when hou&s;es, lands, thrones, crowns and &s;cepters are in view. Men of ill de&s;igns, have guilty Con&s;ciences,
<PB N="13" REF="001202_0014_0FB12F2D8DA45710">
and faint, cowardly hearts, till Flattery hath given the major part; then they threaten and are full of rage, and fury. It was much ea&s;ier for <HI>Joab</HI> to kill <HI>Ab|ner</HI> and <HI>Ama&s;a</HI> under pretence of <HI>Friend|&s;hip,</HI> than by an open defiance.</P>
<P><HI>PROP.</HI> III. Loo&s;e carnal profe&s;&s;ors, are u&s;ually an ea&s;y prey to <HI>Flatterers,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 15.13. <HI>It was told David the hearts of the men of I&s;rael are after Ab&s;alom;</HI> It &s;eems, he had &s;tolen the hearts of Coun|&s;ellers, and Captains, with the multitude from <HI>David.</HI> We find, <HI>Neh.</HI> 6. <HI>That ma|ny of the Nobles, Prophets, and Prophete&s;&s;es</HI> were corrupted by <HI>Tobiah,</HI> and <HI>Sanballet,</HI> to ob&s;truct that great man in the Service of his <HI>God.</HI> So it appears by our Text, Context, and the books of <HI>Maccabees,</HI> that many of all ranks of men were thus cor|rupted by Flatteries.</P>
<P>That prophane Profe&s;&s;ors are an ea&s;y prey to Flatterers, may appear by the following Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P N="1">1. They taking up <HI>Religion on tru&s;t,</HI> without a per&s;onal, experimental know|ledge of the &s;weetne&s;s, plea&s;ure, Soul &s;atisfying delight it affords, find the du|ties of Religion <HI>Burthen&s;ome</HI>; and &s;ay,

<P N="2">2. <HI>Sin</HI> being &s;till predominant in them, (only under &s;ome re&s;traint by their pro|fe&s;&s;ion) they on the proffers made by <HI>Flatterers,</HI> overcome the <HI>impediment,</HI> and run with more violence to all manner of exce&s;s, &amp; riot, and their la&s;t State is wor&s;e than the fir&s;t; as tho&s;e who have been long kept in, from the gratifying their &s;en&s;ual appetites; when once the bridle is taken away, they are <HI>as the &s;wift Dro|medary traver&s;ing her way in the wilderne&s;s,</HI> and hate to be controuled.</P>

<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> II. <HI>How</HI> doth this <HI>knowledge of God</HI> &s;e|cure from being <HI>corrupted by Flattery</HI>?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w. Gen.</HI> In the Holy Scriptures God hath declared, and manife&s;ted the Glory of <HI>His</HI> Na|ture, and Attributes, and he hath therein &s;hew|ed to us the nature, &s;tate, condition, and pro|perties of <HI>Man</HI>: the more then we &s;ee &amp; know of <HI>God</HI> according to the Scriptures, the more cau&s;e &s;hall we find to fix our <HI>Trust,</HI> and de|pendance on him; and the more we &s;ee, and know of <HI>Man</HI> (in Scripture light,) the more cau&s;e &s;hall we find to withdraw our depen|dance from him.

But as to <HI>Man,</HI> we &s;hall &s;ay to our Souls, <HI>Tru&s;t not in Princes, nor the &s;on of Man in whom there is no help; his breath goeth forth, he returneth to his Earth; in that very day his thoughts peri&s;h,</HI> P&s;al. 146.3.4. We &s;hall <HI>cea&s;e from Man who&s;e breath is in his no&s;trils, for where|in is he to be accounted of</HI>?</P>
<P>More Particularly.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Glorious God who&s;e name is, I AM, he only doth <HI>nece&s;&s;arily Exi&s;t</HI>: He hath his being of him&s;elf, from Everla&s;ting, to Ever|la&s;ting he is God; with him <HI>is no variablene&s;s

Every man walketh <HI>in a vain &s;hew; verily every man at his be&s;t e&s;tate is altogether vanity,</HI> P&s;al. 39.5, 6. Oh! therefore it is better to tru&s;t in the Lord, than to put confidence in Man. <HI>It is better to tru&s;t in the Lord, than to put confidence in Princes,</HI> P&s;al. 118.8, 9. <HI>Surely men of low degree are vani|ty, &amp; men of high degree are a lye; to be laid in the the balance they are altogether lighter than vanity; wherefore O my Soul, wait thou only upon God, He only is my Rock, and my Salvation, he is my Defence, I &s;hall not be moved,</HI> P&s;al. 62.7, 9.</P>
<P N="2">2.

He is that God <HI>who cannnot lie</HI>; Tit. 1.2. He is a God keeping Covenant, and remem|bering his Mercy for ever. But wherein is man to be accounted of? He is <HI>altogether be|come filthy, there is</HI> none <HI>righteous, no, not one,</HI> Rom. 3.10. His <HI>heart is deceitful above all things and de&s;perately wicked, Jer.</HI> 17.9. A &s;ource, a fountain of Evil; the <HI>imagination of the thoughts of his heart is only evil continually, from his youth up,</HI> Gen. 6.5. <HI>&amp;</HI> 8.21.</P>
<P>Let <HI>Man</HI> be con&s;idered in his <HI>Carriage to|wards God,</HI> and we find innumerable in&s;tances of tho&s;e who <HI>for&s;ake their own mercies, and em|brace lying vanities.</HI> God complains that they

<P>Now who is there that reads the Character given of men in the Scripture; and ob|&s;erves how this is manife&s;t to their view, and in their own experiences, but will look well to his &s;teps, and take heed, and beware of men.

<P><HI>Much Honoured Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>IT hath plea&s;ed the Glorious GOD to favour you with his Holy Ordi|nances; You have had the means of In&s;truction; and I hope there are ma|ny of you who having the Saving <HI>Knowledge of God</HI> in Chri&s;t Je&s;us as your God in Covenant; have Devoted your &s;elves to his Service; to Serve his Will in your Generation; and that tho' you would do injury to none; Yet if it plea&s;eth the Holy One, the Lord of Ho&s;ts to call you to jeopard your Lives in the High Places of the Field; You would be among tho&s;e who <HI>Offer your &s;elves

The Advice then I would give is, that you would increa&s;e more, and more in the <HI>Knowledge of God</HI>; that being &s;trong in the Lord, and in the Power of his Might, you may be prepared, and ready for Service, that you may be &s;trong, and do <HI>Exploits.</HI></P>
<P>The Con&s;ideration of the &s;tate of things in <HI>Europe,</HI> calls upon us both to be Expert for <HI>War,</HI> and to be Ready for Service: You all know that our Nation, is Engaged in a <HI>Ju&s;t War</HI> a|gain&s;t a Proud, Haughty, Bla&s;phemer, Per&s;ecutor, and Di&s;tuurber of the Common Peace: And tho' we have cau&s;e to be very Thankful for the <HI>Victories</HI> obtained by the Confede|rates, and our Nation in particular; Yet who can tell when the Sword will be put into the Scabbard; and what Service we may be called unto?</P>
<P>And the &s;tate of things in <HI>this Land</HI> al&s;o calls for being alwayes ready;

You all know the hazard our Outward Plantations are continually in, of being a&s;&s;aulted by our Treacherous, and Bloody Enemies: We mu&s;t indeed acknowledge the Favour of God in granting &s;uch Conduct to His Excel|lency our GOVERNOUR, that hath prevented un&s;peakable Mi&s;chief; and done much Good; Yet how many are &s;till in Danger? Even as much as Flocks of Sheep are of Ravening Wolves; therefore &s;hould every one <HI>be ready.</HI> Be&s;ides, you know how much this Town in particular is Ex|po&s;ed to the Attacques of the Enemy by Sea. The la&s;t Alarm &s;hews, that if an Enemy have the advantage of Wind &amp; Tyde, how &s;oon they may be upon us; therefore we &s;hould be alwayes ready.</P>

<P>Fir&s;t; <HI>Study CHRIST and him Cru|cified</HI>; and let the Knowledge of him Engage you to mortifie your Mem|bers that are upon the Earth, to <HI>Cru|cify the Old man, with its affections, &amp; lu&s;ts</HI>: The Scripture &s;aith, <HI>He that is &s;low to anger, is better than the migh|ty; and he that ruleth his &s;pirit, than he that taketh a city,</HI> Prov. 16.3, 21.
