<Q>HE HATH MADE HIS WONDERFUL WORKS TO BE REMEMBERED&mdash;.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE works of God are u&s;ually di&s;tingui&s;hed into tho&s;e of creation, and tho&s;e of provi|dence. By the former, we under&s;tand the &s;tretching forth and garni&s;hing of the heavens, the forming and repleni&s;hing of the earth, and the origi|nating of the pre&s;ent order and cour&s;e of nature. By the latter, are meant the continued pre&s;ervation, the upholding and governing of all the&s;e things; and the &s;uperintending of all events, both in the natural and moral world. All the&s;e are great and wonderful works, worthy to be had in con&s;tant re|membrance by every rational &s;pectator. They make God to be remembered; nay, they are &s;o many me|morials of him, witne&s;&s;ing his eternal power and Godhead, his overflowing benignity, and his care of, and kindne&s;s towards, his creatures.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="027456_0004_0FD43FB7CA2AEF90">
They who have any ta&s;te for intellectual and moral plea&s;ures, who are capable of reli&s;hing what is grand and &s;ublime, will delight in prying into, and con|templating the&s;e great and wonderful works of cre|ation and providence. To this purpo&s;e it is ob&s;erved in the context, that the works of the Lord being great, honourable and glorious, they will be <HI>&s;ought out</HI> or inve&s;tigated <HI>by all them who have plea&s;ure therein.</HI> By the&s;e works the P&s;almi&s;t has &s;pecial reference to the more &s;ignal di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence in his dealings with his covenant people, the de&s;cendants of Abraham his friend. In the&s;e di&s;pen&s;ations he &s;et before them the mo&s;t &s;triking illu&s;trations of his character and glorious perfections. They often &s;aw him, on one occa&s;ion and another, triumphing over the fal&s;e gods of the heathen around them, executing judgment upon their vain idols, and confounding their &s;tupid wor&s;hippers. They &s;aw his infinite power di&s;played in an almo&s;t continued &s;eries of miraculous operations; his ju&s;tice in the exemplary puni&s;hment of cruel oppre&s;&s;ors; his mercy in num|berle&s;s affecting in&s;tances towards them&s;elves; and his truth and faithfulne&s;s in the exact fulfilment of his promi&s;es and predictions. The&s;e things were intended to make la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ions on their minds&mdash;&s;uch as might not be ea&s;ily or &s;peedily effaced. The wonderful works of Providence are wrought for this very purpo&s;e, that, by beholding them, men may be
<PB N="7" REF="027456_0005_0FD43FBA1CB6B540">
&s;o affected, as to have God continually in their thoughts, and thereby be led to fear and &s;erve him.</P>
<P>The text may teach us, that the more &s;ignal mercies of Heaven towards us, and tho&s;e more remarkable deliverances which, at any time, have been wrought in our favour, ought to be gratefully remembered, and thankfully acknowledged by us. The&s;e things are &s;ome of the chief beauties and mo&s;t brilliant pages in that book of Providence, which it highly concerns us daily to read and &s;tudy. This book indeed contains the whole hi&s;tory of God's dealings with mankind, from age to age; in which he di&s;plays his moral perfections to the view of his rational off|&s;pring. The clear light of eternity will &s;how every part of this volume to be full of meaning; and &s;uch an explanation will then be given to tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, which are now e&s;teemed dark and my&s;terious, as will induce enraptured &s;aints, with a&s;toni&s;hment, to ex|claim, <HI>O the depth of the wi&s;dom and knowledge of God!</HI> But while we dwell in this land of &s;hadows and ob|&s;curity, we &s;ee only a &s;mall proportion of what God does; and having &s;uch limited views of his di&s;pen|&s;ations, it is no wonder if we be unable to compre|hend the meaning of particular events.</P>
<P>There are many, however, which contain &s;uch &s;triking illu&s;trations of the divine attributes, e&s;peci|ally of the divine mercy and goodne&s;s, that we can be at no lo&s;s about them. Not a few of the&s;e have
<PB N="8" REF="027456_0006_0FD43FBB593BFDD0">
fallen within our own ob&s;ervation; and many others our ears have heard, and our fathers have told us. God expects and requires, that we gather them up as a trea&s;ure, and carefully pre&s;erve them in our memories. They are in them&s;elves memorable; and he hath done them, that they might be remembered by us. Of cour&s;e, he is highly offended when men <HI>forget his works and the wonders which he hath &s;hewed them.</HI> Such behaviour reflects upon the Divine Ma|je&s;ty, as though his method of governing the world, and his dealings with his creatures, were not worthy of our attention. The mi&s;ery and de&s;truction of men are, in &s;ome in&s;tances, attributed to their not <HI>regarding the work of the Lord, nor con&s;idering the ope|ration of his hands.</HI> And it is certain, that the fre|quent review of the more &s;triking di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence is of excellent u&s;e to confirm us in the belief, and to excite us to the practice, of true religion. Through the weakne&s;s and darkne&s;s of their minds, and the &s;trength of their corruptions, mankind are prone to unbelief. Some, under every advantage for light and conviction, do, notwith&s;tanding, indulge to &s;ceptical opinions: And they would generally, perhaps, be in danger of &s;uch opinions, and of call|ing in que&s;tion the fir&s;t principles and fundamental articles even of natural religion, the being, perfec|tions, and moral government of the Deity; were it not for tho&s;e le&s;s common appearances of his Provi|dence,
<PB N="9" REF="027456_0007_0FD43FC0C7A07FD8">
by which they are awakened to con&s;ider the manifold proofs of a Supreme Almighty Ruler work|ing in the mid&s;t of them, and &s;itting as Governor and Judge among the nations.</P>
<P>At certain periods of time, through the &s;everal ages and among the different nations of the world, God breaks forth in &s;ignal and remarkable di&s;pen&s;a|tions for the relief of the righteous, or for the puni&s;h|ment of the wicked. His providence is &s;een ju&s;tify|ing its own procedure in vindicating and delivering oppre&s;&s;ed innocence, or in precipitating pro&s;perous guilt from its lofty &s;eat. On the&s;e occa&s;ions, God is known by the glory that &s;urrounds him. Beholding the&s;e extraordinary proofs of his pre&s;ence and power, men are con&s;trained to &s;ay, <HI>Verily there is a reward for the righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.</HI></P>
<P>And when we are once e&s;tabli&s;hed in the belief of &s;uch a great and glorious Being, this faith will natur|ally prompt us to fear and &s;erve him. Convinced of his power and ju&s;tice by the awful manife&s;tations of them in his works, we &s;hall be led to &s;tand in awe of him, and heedfully to &s;hun whatever we apprehend to be offen&s;ive in his &s;ight. Struck with the more &s;ignal di&s;plays of his mercy and goodne&s;s, and excited by them to the more fixed contemplation of his un|bounded beneficence; we &s;hall be &s;atisfied, that our happine&s;s mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in the enjoyment of his favour.
<PB N="10" REF="027456_0008_0FD43FC310047AA8">
This per&s;ua&s;ion will render us anxious to know <HI>what the Lord our God requires of us;</HI> and &s;olicitous to ap|prove our&s;elves to him, by a patient continuance in well-doing.</P>
<P>Our pre&s;ent tru&s;t in the divine mercy is al&s;o en|couraged by the remembrance of former favours and deliverances. For this purpo&s;e, among others, the I&s;raelites were enjoined to teach "their children the prai&s;es of the Lord, his &s;trength, and his wonderful works&mdash;that the generation to come might know them&mdash;even the children which &s;hould be born: who &s;hould ari&s;e and declare them to their children; that they might &s;et their HOPE in God."</P>
<P>The honour of God, the intere&s;ts of religion, and the comfort and con&s;olation of good men, being all promoted by the memory of the divine di&s;pen&s;ations; it is highly agreeable to rea&s;on, and con&s;onant to &s;cripture, that public days &s;hould be &s;et apart, on which a whole people may unite in celebrating the goodne&s;s of God; recollecting the in&s;tances of his providential care of, and kindne&s;s towards, them; and talking of his wonderful works in their favour. Such in&s;titutions &s;erve as <HI>pillars of remembrance,</HI> to revive and perpetuate a &s;en&s;e of our obligations to Heaven. The thoughts of the great body of the peo|ple are &s;o taken up about their own private affairs, that they are prone to pay but little attention to the concerns of the public. After the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion is
<PB N="11" REF="027456_0009_0FD43FC446718D28">
worn off, they &s;oon forget, at lea&s;t practically, nation|al mercies and deliverances, as well as national judg|ments. They need to have their minds &s;tirr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d up by way of remembrance. And when God, by a long and continued &s;eries of remarkable interpo&s;i|tions, has multiplied, ble&s;&s;ed, and pro&s;pered any peo|ple&mdash;has, on one occa&s;ion and another, repeatedly re&s;cued them from great and threatening dangers&mdash;put them in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their rights and liber|ties, laws and religion; and from year to year con|tinues them in the quiet enjoyment of the&s;e privi|leges, together with the u&s;ual bounties of his munifi|cent providence; they cannot too frequently recol|lect, nor too fervently and gratefully acknowledge, the&s;e &s;ignal in&s;tances of the divine benignity. It &s;urely becomes chri&s;tian magi&s;trates, and is a duty they owe to God, to call upon their &s;ubjects to unite in commemorating the&s;e wonderful works of Heaven in their favour.</P>
<P>Our forefathers, from the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of the country, e&s;teemed certain &s;ea&s;ons of the year as highly proper for &s;pecial acts of devotion. At the opening of the &s;pring, they judged it fit and &s;uitable, to &s;et apart a day for humiliation and prayer; that they might implore the divine ble&s;&s;ing on the affairs of the en&s;uing &s;ea&s;on&mdash;that it might be rendered fruit|ful, healthy and pro&s;perous. And after the reception of the&s;e mercies, at the clo&s;e of the &s;ea&s;on, another
<PB N="12" REF="027456_0010_0FD43FC5C53121D0">
day was &s;et apart for public thank&s;giving. To this cu&s;tom of our <HI>pious and renowned ance&s;tors</HI> the procla|mation for the ob&s;ervance of this day expre&s;sly refers. To the friends of religion among us it mu&s;t be highly agreeable, to join in making this day a grateful me|morial of God's providential kindne&s;s towards us; and e&s;pecially, in recording the more &s;ignal mercies of the la&s;t revolving &s;ea&s;on</P>
<P><HI>He hath,</HI> &s;ays the proclamation, <HI>been plea&s;ed to favour us with a good mea&s;ure of health, while others, whom we ought to pity and pray for, have been vi&s;ited with con|tagious and mortal &s;ickne&s;s.</HI> In the We&s;t-India I&s;lands, in &s;ome of the &s;outhern &s;tates, and even in the neigh|bouring &s;tate of Connecticut, we have heard of an unu&s;ual mortality. But among our&s;elves, the in|&s;tances of it have, as yet, fallen con&s;iderably &s;hort of the average number for the la&s;t twenty years. It is rare, indeed, that a year pa&s;&s;es over us in which health is more generally enjoyed. Life is the ba&s;is of all our enjoyments in this world; and health is the balm of life. It &s;weetens and enhances all the comforts of life. It enables us to bear our part in the affairs of the world, and to partake of that rich profu&s;ion of good which a bountiful Providence &s;ets before us. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> we &s;ee, or hear of, others from whom this ble&s;&s;ing is withdrawn, it ought to excite our gratitude afre&s;h, that to <HI>us</HI> it is &s;till continued. On this day it becomes us, with increa&s;ed love and thank|fulne&s;s,
<PB N="13" REF="027456_0011_0FD43FC7351D61B0">
to pay our vows to that Being who is the health of our countenance and the God of our lives; who&s;e kind vi&s;itations uphold us in the land of the living, while many others, cut off by pining &s;ickne&s;s, are continually &s;inking into the grave.</P>
<P>Next to the ble&s;&s;ing of health, the proclamation mentions tho&s;e of harve&s;t: <HI>He hath &s;miled on our agri|cultural labours, and cau&s;ed the earth to yield her increa&s;e.</HI> For the &s;pace of &s;ome weeks, at the opening of the &s;pring, our pro&s;pect was melancholy. An early drought and a late fro&s;t, unu&s;ually &s;evere, alarmed our apprehen&s;ions. But, from that period, we have rarely known, in this vicinity, a more fruitful &s;ea&s;on. Refre&s;hing &s;howers &s;ucceeding each other at &s;hort intervals, preceded and followed with a warm &s;un, have furni&s;hed a continued &s;upply of gra&s;s for the cattle, and rendered the latter harve&s;t, and the various productions of autumn, plentiful and abundant. In this re&s;pect al&s;o we record the rich bounty of Provi|dence, and are con&s;trained gratefully to acknowledge, that &s;till "he leaveth not him&s;elf without witne&s;s, in that he continueth to do us good, to give us rain from heaven and fruitful &s;ea&s;ons, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">illing our hearts with food and gladne&s;s."</P>
<P>With the ble&s;&s;ings already recounted the procla|mation goes on to inform us, that <HI>He hath pro&s;pered our fi&s;hery, and in a great mea&s;ure our merchandi&s;e, not|with&s;tanding the depredations of unrea&s;onable de&s;poilers.</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="027456_0012_0FD43FC9EAF19378">
The attack of the&s;e de&s;poilers upon our commerce has undoubtedly been infamous, and &s;uch as ought to be execrated by all civilized nations. And were we to judge of the extent of the mi&s;chief which they have done us, from the repre&s;entations in &s;ome of the public papers, and in the re&s;olves of certain &s;elf-cre|ated &s;ocieties, we might be led to conclude, that the trade of the country was annihilated, and all its mer|chants bankrupts. It is therefore, after &s;uch con|tinued alarms through the &s;ea&s;on, &s;ome con&s;olation to hear, from &s;o high an authority, that, notwith|&s;tanding all our lo&s;&s;es, di&s;appointments and vexations, <HI>a great mea&s;ure</HI> of commercial pro&s;perity has been enjoyed. Of this, indeed, we have yet further evi|dence, even ocular demon&s;tration, in the &s;plendid and princely appearance of many of our mercantile citi|zens, and in the high price of our country produce, enhanced to a degree, which (though oppre&s;&s;ive and ruinous to a few individuals who&s;e &s;ole dependence is upon a fixed &s;tipend) is yet exceedingly gainful to the great body of the community. Such prodigious exportations would not, and could not, be continued, did not the merchant, notwith&s;tanding every ri&s;k, find his account in them.</P>
<P>What a claim upon our gratitude then is this, that, through the mercy of Heaven, we are allowed to in|crea&s;e in wealth, in numbers and &s;trength, at a time, when the nations of Europe are madly wa&s;ting, im|poveri&s;hing
<PB N="15" REF="027456_0013_0FD43FCB096011F8">
and de&s;troying each other. <HI>There</HI> the awakened jealou&s;y of tyrants, tenacious of their u&s;urped powers, and the ferocious zeal, the de&s;perate fury of a mighty, though long oppre&s;&s;ed nation, have &s;et the world in a flame. The&s;e lu&s;ts con&s;ume the abundance of the &s;eas and the trea&s;ures of the dry land, the productions both of nature and art: They lay wa&s;te the works and improvements of ages, and, &s;o far as their power extends, render all the elements &s;ub&s;ervient to mi&s;ery and ruin. What a bla&s;t do the follies and vices of men bring upon the rich ble&s;&s;ings of Heaven? For our continued exemption from the&s;e &s;cenes of deva&s;tation and ruin, how fervent &s;hould be our gratitude to the &s;upreme Di&s;po&s;er! In times pa&s;t we have experienced them; and may Heaven grant, that we may know them no more! As yet we hail each of the contending nations as our friends: and while they are mutually &s;uffering &s;uch compli|cated evils from one another, the&s;e &s;tates pre&s;ent a common a&s;ylum for the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed of all parties, who are almo&s;t daily arriving on our peaceful &s;hores.</P>
<P>The enumeration of ble&s;&s;ings in the proclamation concludes with adding, <HI>He hath continued to us the ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ing of the Go&s;pel, and our religious, as well as civil rights and liberties.</HI> For the former of the&s;e&mdash;the rich ble&s;&s;ings of the Go&s;pel and our religious privileges&mdash;as they are primarily a &s;upernatural grant from Heaven, and compri&s;e all our hopes and pro&s;|pects
<PB N="16" REF="027456_0014_0FD43FCD631F7098">
for eternity; &s;o no period, &s;hort of that endle&s;s duration, will be &s;ufficient for adequate returns of adoration and prai&s;e.&mdash;For the latter, our civil rights and liberties, we are, under Providence, and as the mean by which Heaven has granted and continues them to us, indebted to a cau&s;e or &s;ource which, I am &s;orty to ob&s;erve, is not mentioned, nor even re|ferred to, in the proclamation&mdash;I mean the general or federal government. This omi&s;&s;ion is &s;trange and &s;ingular, beyond any thing of the kind that I recol|lect to have &s;een &s;ince the fir&s;t union of the &s;tates in the memorable year 1775. It has, to &s;ay the lea&s;t, a &s;trong appearance of di&s;connection with the general government, and an air of &s;eparate &s;overeignty and independence, as though we enjoyed not our civil rights in union with the other &s;tates under one com|mon Head.</P>
<P>Here then, I think it my duty, to remind you, that of all our political ble&s;&s;ings for which we ought, on this day, to make our grateful acknowledgments to the Divine Goodne&s;s, our federal government is the greate&s;t, the chief, and, in fact, the ba&s;is of the whole. Its form and con&s;titution are by wi&s;e men univer&s;ally admired. The wi&s;dom, integrity, ability and &s;ucce&s;s of its admini&s;tration have commanded the re&s;pect and applau&s;e of the world. Its happy effects and con&s;equences to our&s;elves, which we have known and experienced, have been great and e&s;ti|mable,
<PB N="17" REF="027456_0015_0FD43FD112ACBF18">
beyond any other political good which we have ever enjoyed. By guarantying to each of the &s;tates a republican form of government, and the en|joyment of every right con&s;i&s;tent with the rights of the whole, it becomes to them all their greate&s;t &s;e|curity again&s;t the attempts both of internal faction and external inva&s;ion. In this view, it is their main pillar of &s;upport and bulwark of defence.</P>
<P>Previous to the adoption of this mo&s;t excellent form of government&mdash;under the old confederation, the&s;e &s;tates pre&s;ented to the world a many-headed mon&s;ter, frightful and alarming to all the lovers of peace and good order. Each &s;tate claimed a neg|ative on the re&s;olves of the whole in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;em|bled; and the regulations of the &s;everal &s;tates re|&s;pectively were continually interfering and cla&s;hing with each other. From this foundation for di&s;cord, parties and divi&s;ions were inevitable. In almo&s;t every &s;tate, many were di&s;affected towards their own immediate government. In &s;ome of the &s;tates, open rebellions exi&s;ted. Things went on from bad to wor&s;e, till the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice was &s;u&s;pend|ed, the laws &s;ilenced&mdash;all public and private faith left without a &s;upport, and the obligation of promi&s;es and contracts &s;et a&s;ide. Men could neither confide in the public, nor in one another. Indu&s;try wanted encouragement&mdash;trade langui&s;hed&mdash;a general unea|&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="18" REF="027456_0016_0FD43FD4C1759C88">
prevailed; and we tottered on the brink of the mo&s;t dreadful convul&s;ions.</P>
<P>The federal government was no &s;ooner organized, than it &s;peedily re&s;cued us from this eminently haz|ardous &s;ituation. It gave fre&s;h vigor to each of the &s;tate governments; awed into &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion the factious through all the &s;tates; re&s;tored the cour&s;e of ju&s;tice, and thereby e&s;tabli&s;hed peace and good order among the citizens at large. It recovered the &s;inking credit of the nation, together with that of the re&s;pective &s;tates; and gave &s;uch a &s;pring to commerce, agri|culture, manufactures, and all tho&s;e u&s;eful arts which &s;upply the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniencies of life, that they have flouri&s;hed to a degree incomparably be|yond what had ever been known in this country be|fore. In promoting the&s;e important ends of every good government, it exceeded the mo&s;t &s;anguine ex|pectations of its friends and patrons. So &s;triking and manife&s;t were its beneficial effects, that even its re&s;tle&s;s enemies were compelled to &s;ilence. This tide of public pro&s;perity continued ri&s;ing even after the commencement of the pre&s;ent troubles in Europe: The current of our trade flowed for a while with but little interruption, and with accumulated profit to our merchants and farmers.</P>
<P>In this pro&s;perous &s;ituation of our affairs, a foreign incendiary appeared among us; the object of who&s;e mi&s;&s;ion was, at all events, to draw us in for a &s;hare
<PB N="19" REF="027456_0017_0FD43FD730977BD0">
in the war of Europe. By fair negociation with the exi&s;ting government, he had no hope of &s;ucce&s;s. It was therefore nece&s;&s;ary, that the government &s;hould be overthrown; or, at lea&s;t, that the wi&s;e and good men entru&s;ted with its admini&s;tration, &s;hould be driven from the helm.

<P>In every country there are &s;ome who envy the abilities of their &s;uperiours, and covet their &s;tations; &s;ome con&s;titutionally turbulent and unea&s;y, who can have plea&s;ure in nothing but &s;cenes of tumult and confu&s;ion; &s;ome who can make them&s;elves con&s;pic|uous on no other occa&s;ions&punc; and &s;ome in de&s;perate circum&s;tances, who&s;e only hope of bettering them is in revolutions of government. Be&s;ides a proportion of all the&s;e, there has been in this country a large party, from the beginning, ill affected toward the federal government, and with the&s;e may be reckoned numbers of ignorant, though hone&s;t, people, who think the period arrived when the debt of gratitude ought to be paid to our allies. The pa&s;&s;ions, pre|judices and opinions of the&s;e &s;everal cla&s;&s;es of people prepared their minds to receive the impre&s;&s;ions of an in&s;idious mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>He immediately put in practice the arts which had proved &s;o dreadfully efficacious in his own coun|try. His intrigues were &s;uddenly and &s;urpri&s;ingly ex|tended. His very breath &s;eemed to kindle the &s;moth|ered

Pre&s;&s;es through the fiates were engaged to for|ward his de&s;igns, by conveying torrents of &s;lander and abu&s;e again&s;t the great officers of government. Pop|ular &s;ocieties, unknown to the laws, were recom|mended and actually formed under the influence of demagogues well &s;killed in the bu&s;ine&s;s of faction. The Briti&s;h councils, as though in league to aid the attempts of GENET, perfidiou&s;ly &s;eized upon our trade, and thereby furni&s;hed (what as yet had been wanting) a plau&s;ible occa&s;ion for clamour to tho&s;e who were &s;eeking it, and a ju&s;t ground of re&s;entment and indignation to the mo&s;t peaceable and well di&s;|po&s;ed. The pa&s;&s;ions of men were worked up to a degree of fury. Ra&s;h and violent mea&s;ures were propo&s;ed and &s;trenuou&s;ly urged.

<P>Such, my hearers, have been the trials and dangers to which our peace, liberty, and all our political happine&s;s, have been expo&s;ed. That the con&s;equences have not, as yet, been more pernicious, we have abundant rea&s;on, this day, to thank and prai&s;e the Supreme Di&s;po&s;er. Our general government, with all our rights and privileges embarked, has been &s;teering between Scylla and Charybdis: That we have not been da&s;hed upon either, is owing to the

<P>The pro&s;pect is now more favourable. Through the wi&s;e and good conduct of the Pre&s;ident, his mini&s;ters, and the men of &s;ober judgment in Con|gre&s;s, we &s;eem to have e&s;caped many rocks and quick&s;ands. With dignity and firmne&s;s they re|&s;i&s;ted the intrigues and machinations of an unwor|thy amba&s;&s;ador, till, at length, they obtained his re|moval. With re&s;pect to the nation from whom we have received unprovoked injuries, while they have been preparing for the dernier re&s;ort, by putting the country into a &s;tate of defence; they have &s;ent forward to them the remon&s;trance of rea&s;on, truth and ju&s;|tice, that (if po&s;&s;ible) they might prevent the dread|ful calamity of war. A degree of &s;ucce&s;s has already attended the negociation. The offending power now appears half a&s;hamed of the wrongs which it hath committed again&s;t us; and is con&s;trained to promi&s;e re&s;titution. They have al&s;o, the pre&s;ent year, been &s;ucce&s;sful again&s;t the ho&s;tile tribes of &s;av|ages: And to &s;uppre&s;s rebellion, have &s;ent forth an army &s;o numerous and powerful as affords the hope|ful pro&s;pect of effecting the purpo&s;e without the effu&s;ion of blood. To the &s;everal democratic &s;o|cieties through the &s;tates, who have ince&s;&s;antly cen|&s;ured, mi&s;repre&s;ented and calumniated all the&s;e mea|&s;ures of our federal rulers, they have oppo&s;ed a dig|nified

patience and moderation, worthy of their high &s;tations and great abilities.</P>
<P>But as tho&s;e &s;ocieties, and the &s;pirit of faction which they engender, nouri&s;h and &s;pread among the people, are, in my view, the greate&s;t danger which, at pre&s;ent, threatens the peace and liberties of our country, I &s;hall clo&s;e this di&s;cour&s;e with a few &s;tric|tures upon them.</P>
<P>In every country the men of ambition, who covet the chief &s;eats in government, exert all their abilities to ingratiate them&s;elves with the &s;ource of power. Under a monarchy they are the mo&s;t &s;ervile courtiers at the levee of the prince. In a republic, the &s;ame men appear in the character of flaming patriots, profe&s;s the warme&s;t zeal for liberty, and call them|&s;elves the <HI>friends</HI> of the people. In monarchies, their intrigues and factions are endle&s;s. But as the monarch him&s;elf is the main object of all their attempts, over whom they endeavour to extend their influence; their factions are u&s;ually limited to the precincts of the court, and rarely occa&s;ion any gen|eral convul&s;ion in the empire. In a republic, the ca&s;e is widely different: thou&s;ands and millions are the object whom they would influence. Of cour&s;e, the more popular any government is, the more liable it is to be agitated and rent by parties and factions. Our's is not the fir&s;t republic which the world has &s;een. Some centuries before the chri&s;tian era, the
<PB N="23" REF="027456_0021_0FD43FDE6BD11638">
&s;tates of ancient Greece and Rome were &s;o many republics. But through the intrigues of ambitious and de&s;igning men, influencing each one his party, they became &s;o many hot beds of faction and di&s;|&s;ention. Their worthie&s;t and be&s;t characters, when &s;uch chanced to hold the reins of government, were &s;oon hunted down; and the vile&s;t of men took their places, and this in continual rotation. Civil wars frequently occurred; and as either party prevailed, pro&s;criptions, bani&s;hments and ma&s;&s;acres en&s;ued. Preci&s;ely the &s;ame &s;cenes are now exhibited in France. We all rejoiced at the downfall of de&s;poti&s;m in that country: We con&s;idered it as the dawn of liberty to the world. But how &s;oon was the fair morning over|ca&s;t? They had no &s;ooner adopted a popular gov|ernment, than all the violence of faction broke out. A con&s;titution, which the collected wi&s;dom of the nation had been two years in framing, was, in a day or an hour, over&s;et and demoli&s;hed. From that time to this, their civil government has been nothing but a conte&s;t of parties, carried on with all the ferocity of barbarians. Previous to the revolution, it was &s;aid of the French, that &s;o refined was their &s;en&s;ibil|ity, &s;o abhorrent of every appearance of cruelty, that they would not &s;uffer tragedy to be acted at their theatres. Is it not a&s;toni&s;hing, how &s;o great a change in the morals and manners of a nation could be &s;o &s;uddenly effected? Faction alone accounts for
<PB N="24" REF="027456_0022_0FD43FE234C95DE0">
it. Had the repre&s;entatives of the nation been left to act their own judgment, uncontrouled by the leaders of faction, they would never have been guilty of tho&s;e exce&s;&s;es and cruelties which chill all hu|mane minds with horror. But how came tho&s;e fac|tious leaders by &s;uch a controuling power over the convention? Solely by means of tho&s;e popular &s;o|cieties in which they pre&s;ided, or over which they fir&s;t gained an influence. The&s;e gave to faction its whole force.</P>
<P>On the &s;ame principles with tho&s;e in France are founded the democratic &s;ocieties in this country; and &s;hould they become numerous here, as they are there, they will infallibly have a &s;imilar effect. Their pretence is, to watch government&mdash;they mean the federal government. But this, like each of the &s;tate governments, is cho&s;en by the nation at large; and, of cour&s;e, every man in his individual capacity has an equal right and an equal intere&s;t in watching its mea&s;ures. What pre&s;umption then is it, and what an u&s;urpation of the rights of their brethren, for private a&s;&s;ociations, unauthorized by the laws, to arrogate this charge to them&s;elves? Admitting the propriety of &s;etting a watch upon Congre&s;s and the Pre&s;ident; are not the &s;tate legi&s;latures fully compe|tent to the bu&s;ine&s;s? Is not their intere&s;t at &s;take, and their jealou&s;y always awake, ready to notice any fault or error in the general government? What then
<PB N="25" REF="027456_0023_0FD43FE3E1F84A00">
is there for the&s;e private a&s;&s;ociations to do? Good they cannot do; and if they do any thing, it mu&s;t be evil. And that they have done evil already, and are, in fact, the &s;upport of a pernicious and invete|rate faction again&s;t the general government, among many other unque&s;tionable proofs, the omi&s;&s;ion of our chief magi&s;trate, ju&s;t mentioned, is, to my mind, not an improbable one. For unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e him to have fallen under the baneful influence of tho&s;e &s;ocieties, we know not how to account for his hav|ing hazarded a proclamation in which we are di|rected, neither to give thanks for any advantages enjoyed by means of that government, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">or even to a&s;k the ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven upon it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This mu&s;t appear the more extraordinary when we reflect, that at the time of i&s;&s;uing the proclamation, war with the &s;avages raged on our frontiers, rebellion in the bo&s;om of the country, and our &s;ituation, with re&s;pect to the powers of Europe, had become &s;o critical, that we were actually for|tifying and forming a numerous army.</NOTE> As though its de&s;truction were already decreed, it is treated as no longer the &s;ubject of prayer.</P>
<P>Should &s;o melancholy an event as its overthrow ultimately take place, no cau&s;e at pre&s;ent appears &s;o probable, as tho&s;e ill-judged a&s;&s;ociations. To pull
<PB N="26" REF="027456_0024_0FD43FE572831378">
down and de&s;troy good governments as well as bad, is their only tendency. In the nature of things they can have no other effect. In &s;uch a country as this, therefore, where, through the di&s;tingui&s;hing mercy of Heaven, we have obtained a government &s;o ad|mirably adapted to promote the general happine&s;s, the&s;e irregular and unwarrantable a&s;&s;ociations ought to be guarded again&s;t and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed with a vigil|ance like that with which we extingui&s;h a fire when it is kindling in a great city. Their meetings are &s;o many collections of combu&s;tibles; and &s;hould they be generally extended, the whole country will be in a flame. The members of tho&s;e &s;ocieties, by virtue of this relation, nece&s;&s;arily become the mere tools and dupes of their artful leaders, who have their own ends to &s;erve by all their profe&s;&s;ions of patrioti&s;m. "The moment a man is attached to a club, his mind is not free: He receives a bias from the opinions of the party: A que&s;tion indifferent to <HI>him,</HI> is no longer indifferent, when it materially af|fects a <HI>brother</HI> of the &s;ociety. He is not left to act for him&s;elf; he is bound in honour to take part with the &s;ociety&mdash;his pride and his prejudices, if at war with his opinion, will commonly obtain the victory; and rather than incur the ridicule or cen&s;ure of his

a&s;&s;ociates, he will countenance their mea&s;ures, at all hazards; and thus an <HI>independent freeman</HI> is con|verted into a mere walking machine, a convenient <HI>engine of party leaders."</HI> In this way a few ambitious individuals are enabled to extend their influence; and as they ri&s;e in power and con&s;equence, to in|fringe upon the liberty of the public.</P>
<P>"Each individual member of the &s;tate &s;hould have an <HI>equal</HI> voice in elections; but the individuals of a club have more than an equal voice, becau&s;e they have the benefit of another influence; that of exten|&s;ive <HI>private attachments,</HI> which come in aid of each man's political opinion. And ju&s;t in proportion as the members of a club have an undue &s;hare of influ|ence, in that proportion they abridge the rights of their fellow citizens. Every club therefore, formed for political purpo&s;es, is an <HI>ari&s;tocracy</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed over their brethren. It has all the properties of an <HI>ari&s;toc|racy,</HI> and all the effects of tyranny. It is a literal truth, that the <HI>democratic clubs</HI> in the United States, while running mad with the abhorrence of ari&s;to|cratic influence, are attempting to e&s;tabli&s;h preci&s;ely the &s;ame influence under a different name. And if any thing will re&s;cue this country from the jaws of faction, it mu&s;t be either the good &s;en&s;e of a great

majority of Americans, which will di&s;courage private political a&s;&s;ociations, and render them contemptible; or the controling power of the laws of the country, which, in an early &s;tage, &s;hall demoli&s;h all &s;uch in|&s;titutions, and &s;ecure to each individual, in the great political family, <HI>equal rights</HI> and an <HI>equal &s;hare of in|fluence</HI> in his individual capacity.</P>
<P>But let us admit that no fatal con&s;equences to government, and equal rights, will en&s;ue from the&s;e in&s;titutions, &s;till their effects on &s;ocial harmony are very pernicious, and already begin to appear. A party &s;pirit is ho&s;tile to all friendly intercour&s;e; it inflames the pa&s;&s;ions; it &s;ours the mind; it de&s;troys good neighbourhood: it warps the judgment in ju|dicial determinations: it bani&s;hes candor and &s;ub|&s;titutes prejudice; it re&s;trains the exerci&s;e of benevo|lent affections; and in proportion as it chills the warm affections of the &s;oul, it undermines the whole &s;y&s;tem of moral virtue. Were the councils of hell united to invent expedients for depriving men of the little portion of good they are de&s;tined to enjoy on this earth, the only mea&s;ure they need adopt for this purpo&s;e, would be, to introduce factions into the bo&s;om of the country.&mdash;Faction begets di&s;order, force, rancorous pa&s;&s;ions, anarchy, tyranny, blood
