<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>July 2, 1720.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have Read the Account you &s;ent me of the State of your Town of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> (which in many particulars, agrees to the whole Province, as well as to your Town, &amp; may indeed be con|&s;idered as the State of <HI>New-England</HI> in Gene|ral.) The late Pamphlets on that Subject di&s;cover plainly eno' the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Circum|&s;tances we are fallen into, tho' I don't perceive they have been at all Succe&s;sful to relieve us in the great thing complained of, <HI>viz.</HI> The want of a &s;ufficient Medium to carry on the Trade, of the Town and Country; But on the contrary, what was &s;ugge&s;ted in them for that end, has produced a quite different Effect, and occa&s;ioned much Contention.</P>
<P>It is unhappy, when Per&s;ons who are concern'd in one common Di&s;tre&s;s, can't con&s;ult their own Intere&s;t, and declare their Minds freely upon it, without giv|ing Offence to one another. And when men &s;uffer them&s;elves to be thus put out of Temper, they are in no good Condition either to give or take Coun&s;el.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen who have Printed their Thoughts on this Occa&s;ion, do (as far as I can di&s;cern) de&s;ire to &s;ee their Country in a Flouri&s;hing Trade, &amp; Pro&s;|perous Condition, as they have &s;een it formerly; They differ indeed in their Conjectures about the Mea&s;ures proper to be taken at this Juncture for this End; But its much to be Lamented, that Gentlemen who de&s;ire the good of their Country, can't declare their differing &s;entiments, about the be&s;t Means to promote it, with|out falling under the Di&s;plea&s;ure of tho&s;e whom they
<PB N="4" REF="002169_0003_0FBC79B393D6A8B8">
&s;tudy to &s;erve. This tends to Di&s;courage our be&s;t Friends from lending us their A&s;&s;i&s;tance when we want it mo&s;t. If a man that candidly &s;peaks his Mind, &amp; declares what he Judges fitte&s;t to be done, under any Difficulty, which he &s;uffers in common with others, mu&s;t for that rea&s;on be treated with Di&s;re&s;pect and Anger, he'l be tempted to conclude its much better for him, to &s;u&s;tain his &s;hare of the Calamity, in Silence.</P>
<P>As far as I am able to ob&s;erve, from what has been Publi&s;hed relating to the Relief &s;o much de&s;ired, the principal Controver&s;y in this Matter, is, whether the Emitting more Bills of Credit, or the calling in tho&s;e that are Extant, will be&s;t an&s;wer that end?</P>
<P>Some are of Opinion that the Emitting of more Bills, either by the Publick, or by Private Under|takers, would be the propere&s;t way to revive our Trade, and recover us out of our pre&s;ent Langui&s;hing Circum&s;tances:</P>
<P>Others, on the contrary, are of Opinion, that the Emitting of more Bills in &s;uch manner, would cer|tainly Augment our Di&s;tre&s;s; and they are therefore for calling in tho&s;e that are out, as &s;oon as may be; and Emitting no more.</P>
<P>And each Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ty, tenaciou&s;ly adhearing to their own Sentiments, and firmly believing their own Method the Propere&s;t, to Extricate us out of our pre&s;ent Dif|ficulties, are under &s;trong Temptations to look on all that oppo&s;e their &s;everal Schemes, as Ob&s;tructions of the Publick Good, and treat them accordingly. While they them&s;elves al&s;o, at the &s;ame time, are requited with the &s;ame hard Mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>But this Anger is I think Unrea&s;onable, &amp; without any ju&s;t Occa&s;ion; for although the&s;e Opinions &s;eem Repugnant, yet if we could be per&s;waded to con&s;ider them (&amp; the rea&s;ons by which they are &s;upported)
<PB N="5" REF="002169_0004_0FBC79B55905A3C0">
calmly, and be cool in our Reflections upon them, we might probably <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a way to Reconcile them, &amp; &s;hew how they may be under&s;tood &amp; improved to that Common Good, which both parties aim at; &amp; even per&s;wade the Di&s;&s;enting Gentlemen them&s;elves to be of one mind, in the manner of promoting it.</P>
<P>This is what I truly de&s;ire. Tho' I mu&s;t confe&s;s I &s;hould be loth to write my mind &s;o freely on this Subject, if I were not well a&s;&s;ured of your Candour. Who ever undertakes the part of a Mediator, where the Contention between the Parties is at all warm, may expect to be encountred with Prejudices from both &s;ides; But I fear nothing of &s;uch a Kind, from a Gentleman of Your Wi&s;dom and Temper. I am &s;atisfied that whatever Favour You have for either of the&s;e Opinions, it will not be unacceptable to You, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o &s;ee that a good U&s;e may be made of them both;</P>
<P>And this is what I aim at; My De&s;ign is to avoid entirely, what may appear in the form of Oppo&s;ition, or tend to over&s;et either of the&s;e differing Opinions, and only to con&s;ider, Whether there are not certain Principles which both Parties will agree to, and which may well be Improved to unite them firmly in one and the &s;ame Mea&s;ure, for promoting the Publick Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>And if it &s;hould prove that I am mi&s;taken in my Thoughts, or deceived in my Hopes, yet to attempt what is &s;o De&s;ireable, as it can't give any ju&s;t ground of Offence to any, &s;o I am &s;ure, it will never be taken &s;o by You.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore ob&s;erve here a few things, which I take to be beyond Di&s;pute &amp; &s;erviceable to the end which I propo&s;e, and &s;ubmit them to your better Judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="002169_0005_0FBC79B68B487938">
In the fir&s;t Place. It will ea&s;ily be granted, that</P>
<P>Trade or Commerce is nece&s;&s;ary to a peoples Pro&s;perity, or Flouri&s;hing in the World. This, &s;ome of your late W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ters. lay much weight on; from hence they urge the nece&s;&s;ity of being provided with a Medium for carrying it on; And if others &s;eem to &s;peak of Trade as a Di&s;advan|tage to us, it mu&s;t be under&s;tood only with re&s;pect to &s;ome Circum&s;tances which attend ours in parti|cular, as, (for In&s;tance) our carrying it to a degree beyond what we are able to manage; Which is as I &s;uppo&s;e, what they mean by our Overtrading; Or our giving to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> long a Credit, whereby people that are never like to Pay, are Tempted to run in Debt: Or becau&s;e its Managed mo&s;tly by a Credit which is not Supported as it ought to be; and is therefore vari|able, and rai&s;ed or depre&s;&s;ed as Managers happen to meet with Chapmen. But it would be unfair to un|der&s;tand them as real Enemies to our Commerce.</P>
<P>No Country has within it &s;elf every thing U&s;eful and conducive to the common Flouri&s;hing and Pro&s;|perity of its Inhabitants. Many things will be wanting, e&s;pecially in new Settlements (as ours may in many Regards be con&s;idered) for the Sub|&s;i&s;tence and Comfort of Per&s;ons, which things mu&s;t be &s;upplyed from other Places; and that &s;upply mu&s;t ordinarily be by Trade.</P>
<P>And the &s;ame holds true, of per&s;ons in the &s;ame Country, who by the means of Commerce must &s;up|ply each other, with what one wants and another has: Providence has &s;o E&s;tabli&s;h'd the State of Mankind, that the World in General, or any par|ticular Country in &s;pecial, can't Flouri&s;h and be Pro&s;perous, without &s;uch a mutual Communication of Goods, or U&s;eful Commodities.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="002169_0006_0FBC79B7F9437838">
Again,</P>
<P>To the carrying on this nece&s;&s;ary Commerce, &s;ome proper Medium mu&s;t be made u&s;e of. It is not ab&s;olutely Impo&s;&s;ible but that it may be done by Barter, or exchanging of one Commodity for another; but &s;ince the In|vention of Money, that method has been much laid a&s;ide; and Money has been Univer&s;ally Re|ceived &amp; Improved, as the (mo&s;t &s;uitable) Medium, for carrying on of Trade, between Per&s;ons &amp; Coun|tries. This I think is a Point uncontroverted. That &s;teady value which the general e&s;teem of Men has put upon Silver, (Intrin&s;ecally con&s;idered) and its aptne&s;s to be formed (as it has been by Authority,) into &s;uitable pieces, of greater and le&s;&s;er Quantities, and tho&s;e of a Determinate Value, ea&s;y to be known, has rendred it the mo&s;t agreeable Medium, by which to rate the Value of all Mer|chandize, and to be made u&s;e of in purcha&s;ing the &s;ame. And 'tis as unque&s;tionable, that</P>
<P>The Trade of any Country mu&s;t be Supported by the Produce of it. The only &s;olid Foundation which any Country has to erect a Trade upon, are &s;uch Commodities as may be &s;pared from their own Occa&s;ions, and exported to &s;upply the Wants of other Places. Whether tho&s;e Commodities are of the Growth or Produce of &s;uch Country, or imported from other Countries, at &s;uch a cheap rate, that they may be exported again &amp; Sold to Advantage.</P>
<P>But generally, The Trade of any Country is &s;up|ported by its own proper Produce, <HI>i. e.</HI> By &s;uch Effects as are rai&s;ed, or Manufactures which are wrought therein. And its no le&s;s certain,</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="002169_0007_0FBC79B98DE79200">
That,</P>
<P>What ever Trade is Managed in any Country to Advantage, the Export mu&s;t exceed the Import. When the Produce of any Country is &s;o con&s;iderable that the Exportation of it, exceeds the Value of what Goods are Imported from other Places, and con&s;umed in it, &s;uch Country will have that Overplus, or Ballance of its Trade in Ca&s;h. When our G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, Provi&s;ion, Furr, Lumber, Fi&s;h, or any kind of Manufacture, or what we can rai&s;e either on the Land, or out of the Water, and can export to other Parts, exceeds in Value all the Goods from other Places, which we have Occa&s;ion to Buy and Con&s;ume, the Ballance of Trade will be &s;o much in Ca&s;h to our Advantage. On the contrary, when the Import is more in Value than our Export, the Ballance will be to our Di&s;advantage, &s;o much as that exceeds this; If we want European or any other Goods, in &s;uch a Degree, that all the Produce of our Country, which we can &s;pare, is not Equiva|lent to it, we &s;hall be &s;o much more in Debt, than we can Pay with our Produce; And this Ballance mu&s;t be Paid in Money.</P>
<P>I may here al&s;o Ob&s;erve, That</P>
<P>The Medium of Trade, does Natural|ly follow Trade, and is Gained by it. Such Countries as can't Produce the matter of this Medium, <HI>viz.</HI> Silver, out of their own Bowels, have ordinarily no way to &s;upply them&s;elves with it, but by their own Produce. And when any Country can afford the Commodities, wanted in other Places, at &s;uch a Rate, that tho&s;e who Improve them&s;elves in Trade, can purcha&s;e them with Money and Export them to Advantage, their own Intere&s;t will put
<PB N="9" REF="002169_0008_0FBC79BC92E71898">
them upon bringing Money into &s;uch a Country for that end.</P>
<P>And,</P>
<P>The Medium of Trade, or Money, thus brought into a Country, will remain there in a Sufficient Plenty for its ordi|nary Occa&s;ions, &s;o long as the Ballance of their Trade is in their Favour, <HI>i. e.</HI> So long as &s;uch Country does not Purcha&s;e &amp; Con|&s;ume more forreign Goods, than it vends of its own.</P>
<P>And hence it follows, That</P>
<P>The Diligence and Frugality of a Peo|ple, is Nece&s;&s;ary to Pre&s;erve the Trade of any Country, in &s;uch a State of Advan|tage to them&s;elves. No Country can hope to be in a Flouri&s;hing Condition, when the People of it are not Diligent in their Bu&s;ine&s;s, or don't govern them&s;elves as to their Expences, &s;o as not to ex|ceed their Produce or Income; for &s;o much as they exceed that, they will be in Debt: and that Debt may in time exceed the value even of their Real E&s;tates, &amp; Reduce them to be wor&s;e than nothing. This &s;hews, that the Di&s;cour&s;e of tho&s;e Gentlemen, who are for retrenching our needle&s;s, Extravagant Expences, as one nece&s;&s;ary part of the Project, to remedy our pre&s;ent Di&s;tre&s;s, is very rea&s;onable. Nothing can be more Obvious, than that tho&s;e who&s;e Expences are greater than their Gains mu&s;t needs in time be Reduced to Penury; though the be&s;t Me|dium of Trade be never &s;o plenty among them. We
<PB N="10" REF="002169_0009_0FBC79BE00145708">
ought therefore to con&s;ider, what our diligent La|bour, and good Hu&s;bandry will afford us, and be &s;ure to keep within tho&s;e Bounds, in our Apparel. Buildings, Tables, Funerals, and every Article of Expence. For if by any Methods we &s;pend more than we Gain, we are not like to e&s;cape the Di&s;tre&s;|&s;es of Poverty.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be con&s;idered al&s;o, That</P>
<P>A Diligent and Frugal People may &s;ometimes be in great want of Money. Their Circum&s;tances may be &s;uch, that their Intere&s;t and Pre&s;ervation may demand on a Sudden, a greater Sum, than they can po&s;&s;ibly furni&s;h them&s;elves with at the time. So it &s;ometimes happens in War, when their all may ly at Stake, and they mu&s;t do their utmo&s;t to &s;ave them&s;elves. Such a Defence may put them to &s;o great a Charge, that a Sum of Money &s;ufficient to defray it, can't be Collected at the time, tho' their E&s;tates are worth very much more and they are well able in proce&s;s of Time to produce a much greater Sum; And &s;o it may happen on other Occa&s;ions; as, for the carrying on of &s;ome great and u&s;eful Works, or profitable Manufactures, or for purcha&s;ing &s;ome great Privi|ledges which would be of general Benefit to them for Generations to come.</P>
<P>And certainly</P>
<P>In &s;uch Ca&s;es as the&s;e, it may be very Prudent for &s;uch a People to make u&s;e of their Credit. <HI>i. e.</HI> To &s;upply &s;uch Urgent Occa&s;ions, with their BILLS or BONDS, whereby they oblige them&s;elves to rai&s;e and Pay the Sum
<PB N="11" REF="002169_0010_0FBC79BFA14C5A60">
of Money which they want, in &s;ome Convenient time. This PUBLICK CREDIT, if it be good, (<HI>i. e.</HI> if there be no doubt but that &s;uch a People are well able to rai&s;e, &amp; will Hone&s;tly Pay the Money, by the time,) will &s;upply the want of Money, and furni&s;h them with what they need as effectually, as the Money it &s;elf. It would be the undoubted Intere&s;t of particular Per&s;ons, to furni&s;h the Publick with Money, or any thing i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> they have Occa&s;ion for, on their Credit thus good and undoubted.</P>
<P>Of this Nature &s;ome of our Publick bills are e&s;teemed to be, <HI>viz.</HI> Tho&s;e that have been Emitted for the Payment of Publick Debts. (And for that rea&s;on I &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome Gentlemen &s;peak of the Bills them&s;elves, as a Medium of Trade,) becau&s;e they &s;upply the Want of Money; though I think what they intend therein, has been mi&s;taken by many; as if they meant another Medium, clear and di&s;tinct from Money; Whereas I don't take them to intend, that Money is not, properly &s;peaking, the Medium of Trade. For we &s;till reckon the Value of every thing we Trade in, by <HI>Pounds, Shillings, &amp; Pence;</HI> Which Terms are Denominations, or Names of &s;everal Pieces of Money; and the&s;e Names are con&s;tantly u&s;ed in Trade to expre&s;s the worth of any Merchandi&s;e; Money therefore abides the &s;tan|dard, by which the Prices of the Goods we Trade in, are computed and expre&s;&s;ed. And when we u&s;e our Publick Bills in Payment, it is a Trading for Money <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ill, though that Money is not to be pre|&s;ently Paid, but by a certain time, for which the Bill given in Payment is (<HI>or ought to be</HI>) a good Security. And he that takes the Bill in Payment, is a&s;&s;ured, that if he has that Bill at the time &s;et for the Payment of it, he &s;hall if he plea&s;e have its Value in Money. Whence its evident that the&s;e
<PB N="12" REF="002169_0011_0FBC79C14DF453A0">
Publick Bills, are really of the &s;ame Nature with the Bill or Bond of a Private Per&s;on, of &s;uch un|doubted Credit, that every one would take his Bill for <HI>Twenty,</HI> or <HI>Forty Shillings,</HI> or any other Sum as &s;oon as &s;o much Money. Becau&s;e that Bill is &s;uch a Security for the Money, as he dares rely upon; and which he is a&s;&s;ured will not fail him.</P>
<P>But then we mu&s;t always remember, That</P>
<P>When any Nece&s;&s;ity or Con&s;ideration what&s;oever, puts a Country on making u&s;e of their Credit in want of Money, &s;uch Credit ought to be very punctu|ally Supported. And to the Support of this Credit, Two things mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be evident to all that &s;hall have any Occa&s;ion to depend upon it.</P>
<P>As,</P>
<P N="1">1. The Ability of &s;uch a Country, to an&s;wer by the time, all the Bills they have given, if it be demanded of them.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Integrity and Hone&s;ty of &s;uch a Country, that as They are well able, &s;o They will certainly be as good as their Word; and keep time punctu|ally with all that have tru&s;ted them, and taken their Bills, in payment.</P>
<P>If either of the&s;e be Su&s;pected, their Credit will Sink; and if &s;uch a Country don't remove all ju&s;t grounds of &s;uch Su&s;pition, their Credit will lower as that Su&s;pition ri&s;es, &amp; when it has pa&s;&s;ed thro many Degrees of Contempt, will come to nothing.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="002169_0012_0FBC79C2F29D3AC8">
Further,</P>
<P>The Supporting of &s;uch a Publick Credit, is neither Impracticable, nor a matter of meer Prudence only, or purely Arbitrary, which may be done or neg|lected at Plea&s;ure, but &s;uch Credit can and ought to be Supported. I &s;ay it can, becau&s;e its &s;uppo&s;ed in this ca&s;e that &s;uch a Country has a Sufficient E&s;tate, &amp; can fulfil all its Engage|ments. Now for &s;uch a Country to &s;uffer their Credit to be Dimini&s;hed, or &s;ink, &s;o that perhaps <HI>Twenty Shil|lings</HI> in their Credit, will be no better in Trade to tho&s;e that have it, than <HI>Fourteen,</HI> or <HI>Twelve,</HI> or <HI>Ten Shillings</HI> in <HI>Money,</HI> is not only to deal Fal&s;ly, and be wor&s;e than their Word, but its al&s;o a great wrong to multitudes; For &s;ome per&s;ons, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily loo&s;e or &s;uffer as much wrong, as the <HI>Publick Credit</HI> becomes wor&s;e than <HI>Money.</HI> Wherefore this Credit ought in Ju&s;tice to be Supported; and wilfully to &s;uffer it to Sink, is to be guilty of great Unrighte|ou&s;ne&s;s, and I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">jury to many, and particularly to all Publick Mini&s;ters and Creditors, as al&s;o to Widows &amp; Orphans, who&s;e Intere&s;t &amp; Protection ought to be Con&s;ulted.</P>
<P>To this I may add, That</P>
<P>When the Publick Credit, &s;o made u&s;e of, is well &s;upported, it can't be Injurious. For if the Publick Bills Emitted are kept up to their full Value during the whole time of their Circulation, whoever takes them at the Value of their Denomination, &amp; gives for them, what he would Sell for &s;o much <HI>Money,</HI> may immediately
<PB N="14" REF="002169_0013_0FBC79C3F63A6688">
make the &s;ame u&s;e of them him&s;elf; And &s;o may every one who &s;ucce&s;&s;ively receives them, till the time of their Circulation is up, and there is <HI>Money</HI> to an&s;wer them, to all that de&s;ire it.</P>
<P>Let now the <HI>Publick Bills of Credit</HI> be thus Sup|ported, which They ought to be, and will be, if we can but convince tho&s;e that have occa&s;ion to receive them in Trade, that we are not more in Debt than we are worth, and that we will hone&s;t|ly pay our Debts, and I can &s;ee no harm in gra|tifying the De&s;ire of tho&s;e Gentlemen, who are for Emitting more Bills, for pre&s;ent U&s;e, if there &s;hould by any means happen a &s;carcity of the <HI>Me|dium of Trade,</HI> or <HI>Money,</HI> among us; and other|wi&s;e, They don't &s;eem to de&s;ire it.</P>
<P>I will add this one Thing more.</P>
<P>If any particular Per&s;ons have occa&s;ion to take up Money on U&s;e, I don't &s;ee why the Publick in &s;uch ca&s;e may not &s;upply them, by lending the Publick Credit, when Money is not to be had. And if during &s;uch Loan, the <HI>Publick</HI> will Sup|port the Credit they lend, &s;o that it may hold its value in Trade, and be as good as <HI>Money,</HI> I don't &s;ee but They may ju&s;tly receive the &s;ame Recom|pence for the loan of this <HI>Credit,</HI> as they might for lending the like Sum in <HI>Money.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e Gentlemen therefore, who declare again&s;t Emitting more Bills on Loan; or, which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the &s;ame Thing, again&s;t the Country's lending their Credit, mu&s;t be under&s;tood, only, in Ca&s;e the <HI>Publick Credit</HI> &s;hould remain under its pre&s;ent Di&s;|advantages,
<PB N="15" REF="002169_0014_0FBC79C649852DF8">

For in &s;uch Ca&s;e, Every one may be &s;en&s;ible, that to increa&s;e the Number of Bills of Credit, would be a great Mi&s;chief, and certainly increa&s;e the Wrong which many &s;uffer by their being already &s;o greatly di&s;|paraged.</P>
<P>But if the <HI>Publick Credit</HI> as often as it is made U&s;e of, either in paying of Debts or in Loan, be Supported, and kept up to its ju&s;t Value, &s;o that it will in Trade an&s;wer the End, and be as U&s;eful as <HI>Money,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e no Gentlemen would take Offence at a more Exten&s;ive Improvement of it; or think it an Injury for the Country to make &s;uch a Loan of their Credit, to any per&s;ons that can make a good U&s;e of it. E&s;pecially con&s;ider|ing that tho' the Per&s;ons that Borrow it, de&s;ign to improve it to their own particular Advantage, Yet if they &s;ucceed in their de&s;ign, as its to be hoped They may, it will at la&s;t redound to the Publick Advantage;</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e Con&s;iderations, I think tho&s;e Gen|tlemen who have differed &s;o much in their Senti|ments, about &s;upplying at this Juncture the want or &s;carcity of the Medium of Trade, may well be Reconciled.</P>
<P>For,</P>
<P>Whether we do, or do not, make any further U&s;e of the <HI>Publick Credit,</HI> certainly it concerns us to hearken to what is &s;o earne&s;tly in&s;i&s;ted on by many Gentlemen; the retrenching Our Expences, that They may not exceed our Gains; or that our Import may not be greater than our Export; without which we mu&s;t needs be greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">en undone.</P>

And, Tho&s;e who are for calling in all the Bills of Credit emitted, by the time &s;et for it, may with|out any Danger be gratified, Provided the Publick does but &s;upply, what want we may be in of Ca&s;h, by Emitting more Bills of Credit.</P>
<P>And, Tho&s;e who think it very nece&s;&s;ary at this Juncture, that the Government &s;hould &s;till make u&s;e of their Credit, both to Pay their Debts, &amp; to &s;erve other Emergencies, may &s;afely be gratifyed. Provided effectual care be taken to &s;upport &s;uch Cre|dit, the whole time it is made u&s;e of.</P>
<P>Nay even, Tho&s;e that Favour a Private Bank or Credit, rather than a Publick one, may for ought I know be gratifyed without Danger, provided it be under &s;uch a Publick Regulation, as would &s;atisfy all, that the Bills of &s;uch a Private Bank &s;hould be upheld in Trade, and be made as u&s;eful as Money, during the Convenient time &s;et for their Circula|tion; and that when &s;uch time is expired, tho&s;e that have any &s;uch Bank Bills in their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, may if they plea&s;e exchange them for Money.</P>
<P>This therefore is the chief thing nece&s;&s;ary, that whatever Credit there may be Occa&s;ion to make u&s;e of, it &s;hould be &s;upported in &s;uch an e&s;teem and U&s;efulne&s;s as it ought to have in Trade, that is to &s;ay (at lea&s;t) equal to Money during the whole time of its Circulation. That this is practicable appears from what has been &s;aid already; again&s;t the Ju&s;|tice of it no man can rea&s;onably Object. And were this once done, we &s;hould &s;oon &s;ee an end of the Contention about Emitting more Bills. For, Then no man would have any ju&s;t rea&s;on to fear,</P>
<P>Either, That the Bills would be hoarded up, more than Ca&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="002169_0016_0FBC79CA20CBA140">
Or, That our Credit would be extended too far;</P>
<P>Or, That our Bills would be Improved for any longer time, than till our Ordinary Occa&s;ions of Trade &amp; Expence, may well enough be Supplyed, with &s;uch a Stock of Money, as by our Diligence &amp; Good Hu&s;bandry, we may procure.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e, When &s;uch a Stock is attained, there will then be no nece&s;&s;ary Occa&s;ion for Improving Credit any longer in &s;uch a manner.</P>
<P>Wherefore tho&s;e Gentlemen who have differed in their Sentiments, about Emitting more Bills, &amp; calling in tho&s;e that are Emitted, would I am per&s;waded find them&s;elves well &s;atisfied, in any fair &amp; rea&s;onable Project, to re&s;tore &amp; keep in good Credit the Bills Improved in Trade, &s;o that they &s;hould be of Value equal to Money; until &s;uch time as we might be furni&s;hed with a Sufficiency of Money, to &s;upply our Ordinary Occa&s;ions, and to carry on a Trade, within the Compa&s;s of our A|bilities, <HI>i. e.</HI> &s;uch an one as does not exceed what we are able to &s;pare out of our own produce, for the carrying of it on;</P>
<P>E&s;pecially con&s;idering that when the Bills of Credit are re&s;tored to the Value of Money; a much le&s;s Quantity of them would &s;uffice for the&s;e Oc|ca&s;ions.</P>
<P>And I can't &s;ee but They mu&s;t on both &s;ides find them&s;elves di&s;appointed at la&s;t, if there &s;hould be no care taken to revive the Credit of Our Bills, but they are &s;uffered to remain under the pre&s;ent di&s;advantage, and increa&s;ing Di&s;count.</P>
<P>For, Suppo&s;e No more Bills be emitted, and tho&s;e that are out, be drawn in as fa&s;t as may be, by
<PB N="18" REF="002169_0017_0FBC79CB74FA6890">
Sueing the Mortgages on which the mo&s;t of them are Lent, then indeed the Mortgagers may many of them loo&s;e their E&s;tates, but They that happen to have the Bills in their keeping, may be as far as ever from receiving either Money, or Money's worth, for them. For as there never was any <HI>Pub|lick Provi&s;ion</HI> made for the drawing in tho&s;e loan Bills by a Common Rate; or having Money in the Trea&s;ury to Ballance again&s;t them; &s;o neither can tho&s;e that have them, be &s;ure of having any part of the Mortgaged E&s;tates in Exchange for them. When the Publick has &s;ued the Mortgages and re|covered the E&s;tates, who can tell what they may think good to do with them? Some have thought that when the Mortgagers have paid by Intere&s;t, the Value of the principal, the principal will be Re|mitted to them; and if &s;o, there may then be no Mortgaged E&s;tates, for the&s;e Gentlemen to take in Exchange for their Bills; or (which is the &s;ame thing) to purcha&s;e with tho&s;e Bills, if they re&s;erve them for that end.</P>
<P>This project of Remi&s;&s;ion &s;ome may think un|rea&s;onable, but it may not &s;eem &s;o to others, who may po&s;&s;ibly have a great Influence in the ordering of that Affair.</P>
<P>Or if it &s;hould, yet they may think it fair to lea&s;e tho&s;e E&s;tates to the Mortgagers with Condition of Redemption in &s;ome convenient time; &s;ince it may &s;eem hard in &s;uch a ca&s;e if no time of Redemp|tion be allowed. Or</P>
<P>It may be thought nece&s;&s;ary to Sell them for <HI>Money</HI> only. The&s;e are things which may appear here|after, in a quite different View, to the Government, both at Home, &amp; Here, than they do now to us.
<PB N="19" REF="002169_0018_0FBC79CFA4E338D8">
Upon all which accounts it may not be &s;o &s;afe for any Gentlemen, who may re&s;erve &s;uch Bills by them, to Flatter them&s;elves, that they &s;hall ever be able to exchange them, for Moneys worth, (or their Va|lue in Money) unle&s;s the Credit of them be Re&s;tored &amp; E&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed, that when the Mortgaged E&s;tates are Recovered, the Government mu&s;t then call in by Rate all the out&s;tanding Bills, or Cur|rant Money in &s;tead of them; and that then there would be Money in the Trea&s;ury to Exchange for them.</P>
<P>This Suppo&s;ition is as Uncertain as any of the former. Tho&s;e that may be then in the Admini&s;tra|tion, may be of another Mind.</P>
<P>There is no Provi&s;ion of &s;uch kind made by any Act of the Government, whereby They &s;tand engaged &s;o to do; Which, If it had been de&s;ign'd at la&s;t, would probably have been declared at fir&s;t. Yea, The Contrary &s;eems to be implied by the Acts for the Loan of Bills; for it does not appear by tho&s;e Acts, that Tho&s;e Bills were to have any Credit, but what the Mortgages gave them; Which men might rely upon as They &s;aw Good.</P>
<P>Its pretty remarkable, that many who plea&s;e them&s;elves with this Conceit, that the Government mu&s;t at la&s;t, (if Suing the Mortgages don't bring in the Bills) take this Method, and provide that all the Out&s;tanding Bills &s;hould within a conve|nient time be drawn into the Trea&s;ury by Rate, or Money in&s;tead of them; are neverthele&s;s utterly again&s;t the &s;ame Project, when its propo&s;ed as a pre&s;ent method to recover the Credit of our Bills even to the Value of Money.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="002169_0019_0FBC79D1CEAE1268">
But, How can &s;uch Gentlemen who are di&s;cou|raged from making this Attempt now, imagine, that Tho&s;e who are in the Admini&s;tration when the Mortgages are Sued out, will be per&s;waded to do the &s;ame thing on a Pu&s;h, which mu&s;t needs be much more difficult, and a far greater burthen on the People. If there be any Rea&s;on for it, Yet it does not &s;eem &s;o fair for Us to think, that tho&s;e who come after Us, if they can help it, will put them&s;elves to greater Difficulties to pay the Debts we have contracted, than ever We were willing to do our &s;elves.</P>
<P>It &s;eems therefore that tho' no more Bills &s;hould be Emitted, it is of great Con&s;equence that the Credit of tho&s;e that are now Extant &s;hould be re&s;tored and maintained during the whole time of their Circulation.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, if no Care be taken to revive the Credit of our Bills, what Satisfaction can we take, in the Emi&s;&s;ion of More? When it is &s;o manifest that the Di&s;count which is come on tho&s;e that are already emitted, and which has been the Occa&s;ion of &s;o much Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, and great wrong to many, will thereby be increa&s;ed!</P>
<P>I will make but one Remark more, which &s;hall be</P>
<P>Upon the Ca&s;e of tho&s;e that have taken up Bills on Loan. Which many begin to look upon with Concern. Their E&s;tates are Mortgaged; And if the Bills that are Extant, are (as &s;ome think) in Hands which re&s;erve them, for &s;ome con&s;iderable Advan|tage, &s;o that the Mortgagers can by no means procure them, to Redeem their E&s;tates, They will in a little time be forfeited:</P>

In <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of a Mortgage given to a private per&s;on, it would be look'd on as a Hard&s;hip, if the Mortgagees &s;hould take Advantage of the Mortgagors, and eject them out of their Land, as &s;oon as the time &s;et in their Mortgages is expired. Nor is this ordina|rily done. The Mortgagees don't think much (having good Security for their <HI>Money</HI>) to allow many Years after the time is up, to the Mortgagors, to procure the <HI>Money</HI> and &s;ave their E&s;tates; and this is thought but a rea&s;onable Favour, provided the Mortgagors duely pay the Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Whereas, as &s;oon as the Mortgages made to the Publick are forfeited, they mu&s;t its concluded, be Sued out immediately; this being the way propo&s;ed to bring the Bills into the Trea&s;ury, and keep them from &s;inking into the la&s;t Contempt.</P>
<P>But if our Bills of Credit, were re&s;tored to be as good as <HI>Money,</HI> men would &s;oon unlock their Hoards, &amp; make u&s;e of the Bills they keep by them. By which means the Mortgagors might be able to procure what they want to redeem their E&s;tates; And if they &s;hould not be able to do it by the time &s;et in the Mortgages, the Publick might, as well as any Private Per&s;on, allow them more time for it, and not put them to the Extremity of Redeeming their E&s;tates now or never. For if during &s;uch time, the Credit of our Bills be kept up to a Par with <HI>Money,</HI> as they may &amp; ought to be, No Per&s;on could be Injured by &s;uch a Favour to the Owners of the Mortgaged E&s;tates, or have the lea&s;t rea&s;on to be troubled at it.</P>
<P>To me therefore, it &s;eems, as if the re&s;toring &amp; upholding our Bills of Credit to their ju&s;t Value, would be an excellent means to put an End to the&s;e Controver&s;ies, and give every one Content. Then,

If a &s;uitable Quantity of Bills &s;hould be Emitted, They would be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> as <HI>Money</HI> during the time of their Circulator.
