<P>MANKIND are generally aver&s;e to in|novations both in religion and go|vernment. Laws and con&s;titutions to which they have been long u&s;ed, they are fond of retaining, even though better are offered in their &s;tead. This appeared in the Jews. Their law required a burden&s;ome and
<PB N="6" REF="012813_0004_0F8AB96B8FD4FA80">
expen&s;ive &s;ervice: chri&s;tianity &s;et them free from this law. Neverthele&s;s, many of them were de&s;irous of continuing the ob&s;ervation of it, after they became chri&s;tians; and of having the gentile converts al&s;o &s;ubmit to it. Accord|ingly there were &s;ome Judai&s;ing teachers who endeavoured to per&s;uade the Galatians to this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The Apo&s;tle, therefore, in this epi&s;tle, particularly in the immediately forego|ing chapter, a&s;&s;erts and proves, that chri&s;tians have nothing to do with the ceremonial law of the Jews, they being freed by Chri&s;t, from this burden. And then as an inference from what he had &s;aid, and by way of admonition to the Galatians, he &s;ubjoins the exhortation in the text; &s;tand fa&s;t therefore in the liberty where|with Chri&s;t hath made us free.</P>
<P>BUT though the words originally refer to that freedom from the Jewi&s;h law which the go&s;pel confers on the church of God; yet the rea&s;on of the inference holds good in the ca&s;e of any other real and valuable liberty which men have a right to: So that this ob&s;ervation is plain|ly deducible from the text; viz. that it is the duty of all men to &s;tand fa&s;t in &s;uch valuable li|berty, as providence has confered upon them.</P>
<P>THIS ob&s;ervation I &s;hall endeavour, by the help of God, to illu&s;trate and improve: In order to which, I &s;hall &s;hew;
<LIST>

<ITEM>I. WHAT I intend by that liberty in which men ought to &s;tand fa&s;t.</ITEM>

</LIST></P>
<P>After which, I &s;hall &s;ubjoin &s;ome reflections, and apply the &s;ubject to the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>
<P N="1">I. I am to &s;hew what is intended in this di&s;cour&s;e by the liberty in which men ought to &s;tand fa&s;t.</P>
<P>THOUGH this word is u&s;ed in various &s;en&s;es, I mean by it here, only that liberty which is op|po&s;ed to external force and con&s;traint, and to &s;uch force and con&s;traint only, as we may &s;uffer from men. Under the term liberty, taken in this &s;en&s;e, may naturally be comprehended all tho&s;e advantages which are liable to be de&s;troyed by the art or power of men; every thing that is oppo&s;ed to temporal &s;lavery.</P>
<P>THIS liberty has always been accounted one of the greate&s;t natural ble&s;&s;ings which mankind can enjoy. Accordingly, the benevolent and impartial Father of the human race, has given to all men a right, and to all naturally an equal right to this ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="012813_0005_0F8AB96C65FC8490">IN a &s;tate of nature, or where men are under no civil government, God has given to every one liberty to pur&s;ue his own happine&s;s in what|ever way, and by whatever means he plea&s;es, without a&s;king the con&s;ent or con&s;ulting the in|clination of any other man, provided he keeps within the bounds of the law of nature. Within the&s;e bounds, he may govern his actions, and di&s;po&s;e of his property and per&s;on, as he thinks proper. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Lock on government.</NOTE> Nor has any man, or any number of men, a right to re&s;train him in the exerci&s;e of this liberty, or puni&s;h, or call him to account for u&s;ing it. This however is not a &s;tate of licenti|ou&s;ne&s;s, for the law of nature which bounds this liberty, forbids all inju&s;tice and wickedne&s;s; al|lows no man to injure another in his per&s;on or property, or to de&s;troy his own life.</P>
<P>BUT experience &s;oon taught that, either thro' ignorance of this law, or the influence of un|ruly pa&s;&s;ions, &s;ome were di&s;po&s;ed to violate it, by encroaching upon the liberty of others; &s;o that the <HI>weak</HI> were liable to be greatly injured by the &s;uperior power of bad men, without any means of &s;ecurity or redre&s;s. This gave birth to ci|vil &s;ociety, and induced a number of individuals to combine together for mutual defence and &s;e|curity; to give up a part of their natural liber|ty for the &s;ake of enjoying the remainder in greater &s;afety; to agree upon certain laws a|mong them&s;elves to regulate the &s;ocial conduct of each individual; or to intru&s;t to one or more
<PB N="9" REF="012813_0005_0F8AB96C65FC8490" MS="y">
of their number, in who&s;e wi&s;dom and, good|ne&s;s they could confide, a power of making &s;uch laws, and putting them in execution.</P>
<P>IN this &s;tate, the liberty which men have is all that natural liberty which has been menti|oned, excepting what they have <HI>expre&s;sly</HI> given up for the good of the whole &s;ociety; a liberty of pur&s;uing their own happine&s;s, governing their actions, and di&s;po&s;ing of their property and per|&s;ons as they think fit, provided they tran&s;ge&s;s no law of nature, and keep within tho&s;e re&s;trictions which they have con&s;ented to come under.</P>
<P>THIS liberty will be different in different com|munities. In every &s;tate, the members will, pro|bably, give up &s;o much of their natural liberty, as they think will be mo&s;t for the good of the whole. But different &s;tates will judge different|ly upon this point; &s;ome will give up more, &s;ome le&s;s, though &s;till with the &s;ame view, the publick good. And every &s;ociety have doubt|le&s;s a right to act according to their own judg|ment and di&s;cretion in this matter, this being only an exerci&s;e of that natural liberty in which all are bound.</P>
<P>WHEN a &s;ociety commits to one or a few a power to govern them, the general practice is to limit this power by certain pre&s;cribed rules and re&s;trictions. But &s;ometimes this is omitted, and it does not appear from any act of the people, but that the power, with which they have in|tru&s;ted their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, is unlimited. In this ca&s;e
<PB N="10" REF="012813_0006_0F8AB96D132C8DD8">
common &s;en&s;e will tell us that the power grant|ed to rulers is to be limited by the great end and de&s;ign of &s;ociety and government: and he mu&s;t be de&s;titute of common &s;en&s;e, who does not know that this is the general good, the hap|pine&s;s and &s;afety of the whole &s;ociety. So that though a people &s;hould, through inadvertency, neglect to pre&s;cribe any bounds to the power of their rulers, this power would neverthele&s;s be limited, and <HI>they</HI> would be at liberty to refu&s;e &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to &s;uch re&s;traints or laws, as were plainly incon&s;i&s;tent with the publick good.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;ome natural liberties or rights which no per&s;on can divert him&s;elf of, without tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the law of nature. A man cannot, for in&s;tance, give up the liberty of private judg|ment in matters of religion, or convey to others a right to determine of what religion he &s;hall be, and in what way he &s;hall wor&s;hip God. A grant of this nature would de&s;troy the foundation of all religion in the man who made it, and mu&s;t therefore be a violation of the law of nature; nor would he be obliged to abide by it, if in con&s;equence of it, he &s;hould be required to act contrary to the dictates of his con&s;cience. Or &s;hould a man pretend to grant to others a power to order and govern all his actions that were not of a religious nature, &s;o that in all ca&s;es he mu&s;t act agreeable to their direction; this would be incon&s;i&s;tent with that &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion which he owes to the authority of God, and his own con&s;cience. The grant would be in it&s;elf void, and he would, notwith&s;tanding, be at liberty to act according
<PB N="11" REF="012813_0006_0F8AB96D132C8DD8">
to his own con&s;cience, though contrary to the command of tho&s;e to whom he had made &s;o ex|travagant a donation.</P>
<P>SHOULD therefore the legi&s;lature of a &s;tate make laws requiring the &s;ubjects to do things immoral, and which they knew to be &s;o, &s;uch, for in&s;tance, as were apparently de&s;tructive of public happine&s;s, though it was in con&s;equence of an expre&s;s grant of unlimited power, the &s;ubjects would be at liberty to refu&s;e obedi|ence, and not violate con&s;cience or de&s;troy their own happine&s;s. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>All conveyance of ab&s;olute power, whether to a prince or a &s;enate, with a preclu&s;ion of all rights of re|&s;i&s;tance, mu&s;t be a deed originally invalid, as founded in an error about what is mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential in &s;uch tran&s;acti|ons, the tendency of &s;uch power to the general good.</Q>

<P>IT is to be further ob&s;erved here, that &s;tates or communities, as &s;uch, have naturally the &s;ame liberty which individuals have in the &s;tate of nature: but this liberty is re&s;trained, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, by what are called the laws of nations, which are certain rules, that by a tacit con&s;ent are agreed upon among all communities, at lea&s;t among tho&s;e who are accounted the polite and civilized part of mankind. <HI>The&s;e,</HI> nations are not at liberty to violate.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="012813_0007_0F8AB96DCF1B66B0">WHAT has been &s;aid may be &s;ufficient to &s;hew what that liberty is in which men ought to &s;tand fa&s;t. In a &s;tate of nature it is all that liberty which is con&s;i&s;tent with the law of nature; un|der civil government, it is all which is con&s;i&s;tent with the law of nature, and with &s;uch re&s;tricti|ons as they have con&s;ented to come under con|&s;i&s;tently with the law of nature and the end of &s;ociety: and when we con&s;ider one independent &s;tate in reference to another, it is all that natu|ral liberty which is con&s;i&s;tent with the laws of nations.</P>
<P>AND whatever &s;hare men enjoy of this liber|ty, we may properly &s;ay in the words of the text, that Chri&s;t has made them free with it; &s;ince after his re&s;urrection and exaltation to the right hand of the Maje&s;ty on high, all power in heaven and in earth was committed to him, and he now &s;its, and is to continue at the head of God's providential government, till he hath put all enemies under his feet; after which, he &s;hall deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father&mdash;that God may be all in all.</P>
<P N="2">II. I am in the next place to &s;hew in what way men are to &s;tand fa&s;t in their liberty, or what they may and ought to do in defence of it.</P>
<P>IT is here &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;ome attempts are made to injure it. And it has been found in all ages and places that &s;uch attempts have been made by unrea&s;onable and wicked men. The hi&s;tory of mankind is filled with in&s;tances
<PB N="13" REF="012813_0007_0F8AB96DCF1B66B0">
of this; in&s;omuch that if from the great num|ber of hi&s;torical books that have been written, we &s;hould leave out tho&s;e parts that relate to their encroachments upon one another, their in|juries and inju&s;tice, mo&s;t of tho&s;e huge volumes would &s;hrink to a very &s;mall &s;ize. Cain began this practice very &s;oon after the creation: and it has been continued ever &s;ince, both among kingdoms and individuals. And the &s;ame prac|tice is &s;till to be expected, while human nature continues what it is.</P>
<P>NOW for men to &s;tand fa&s;t in their liberty means, in general, re&s;i&s;ting the attempts that are made again&s;t it, in the be&s;t and mo&s;t effectual manner they can.</P>
<P>WHEN any one's liberty is attacked or threat|ened, he is fir&s;t to try gentle methods for his &s;afety; to rea&s;on with, and per&s;uade the adver|&s;ary to de&s;i&s;t, if there be opportunity for it; or get out of his way, if he can; and if by &s;uch means he can prevent the injury, he is to u&s;e no other.</P>
<P>BUT the experience of all ages has &s;hewn, that tho&s;e, who are &s;o unrea&s;onable as to form de&s;igns of injuring others, are &s;eldom to be diverted from their purpo&s;e by argument and per&s;ua&s;ion alone: Notwith&s;tanding all that can be &s;aid to &s;hew the inju&s;tice and inhumanity of their attempt, they per&s;i&s;t in it, till they have gratified the unruly pa&s;&s;ion which &s;et them to work. And in this ca&s;e, what is to be done by the &s;ufferer? Is he
<PB N="14" REF="012813_0008_0F8ABA7B69B07C40">
to u&s;e no other means for his &s;afety, but remon|&s;trance or flight, when the&s;e will not &s;ecure him? Is he patiently to take the injury and &s;uffer him&s;elf to be robbed of his liberty or his life, if the adver&s;ary &s;ees fit to take it? Nature certain|ly forbids this tame &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and loudly calls to a more vigorous defence. Self-pre&s;er|vation is one of the &s;tronge&s;t, and a univer&s;al principle of the human mind: And this princi|ple allows of every thing nece&s;&s;ary to &s;elf-de|fence, oppo&s;ing force to force, and violence to violence. This is &s;o univer&s;ally allowed that I need not attempt to prove it.</P>
<P>BUT &s;ince it has been &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome that chri&s;tianity forbids all violent re&s;i&s;ting of evil, or defending our&s;elves again&s;t injurjes in &s;uch a manner as will hurt, or endanger tho&s;e who at|tack us; it may not be ami&s;s to enquire brief|ly, whether defen&s;ive war be not allowed by the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, the Prince of peace.</P>
<P>AND there are, if I mi&s;take not, &s;everal pa&s;|ages in the new te&s;tament, which &s;hew, that, it was not the de&s;ign of this divine in&s;titution to take away from mankind the natural right of defending their liberty, even by the &s;word.</P>
<P>I will not alledge the words of John the bap|ti&s;t when in an&s;wer to the demand which the &s;oldiers made; <HI>What &s;hall we do?&mdash;he &s;aid un|to them, do violence to no man, neither accu&s;e any fal&s;ely, and be content with your wages.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke 3.14.</NOTE> For

though they plainly imply, that, at that time, the military profe&s;&s;ion was not unlawful, and, con&s;equently, that men might u&s;e the &s;word when there was occa&s;ion for it: yet it does not follow from hence, that the religion which Je|&s;us was to in&s;titute, would allow of that profe&s;|&s;ion and the u&s;e of the &s;word.</P>
<P>BUT there are other pa&s;&s;ages proper to be here alledged.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t that I &s;hall mention is our Lord's own words to Pilate, when under examination before that Governor. The chief charge bro't again&s;t Je&s;us was, that he was going to &s;et up a temporal kingdom incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;ove|reignty of the Roman Emperor. In an&s;wer to which he declared, that his <HI>kingdom was not of this world</HI>; and then offered the following argu|ment to prove the a&s;&s;ertion: <HI>If my kingdom were of this world, then would my &s;ervants fight, that I &s;hould not be delivered to the Jews: But now is my kingdom not from hence.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John 18.36.</NOTE> There is an ellip&s;is in the latter clau&s;e; but the &s;en&s;e of the whole is obviou&s;ly what follows. You know that tho&s;e who aim at temporal dominion, en|deavour to e&s;tabli&s;h their authority and defend them&s;elves, by force of arms, when it is nce&s;|&s;ary: If this had been my aim I &s;hould have ta|ken the &s;ame method, and ordered my &s;ervants to fight again&s;t the Jews when they come to ap|prehend me: Wherefore, &s;ince I have made no violent re&s;i&s;tance; but, on the contrary, "hind|red

one of my di&s;ciples from fighting who &s;ought to re&s;cue me," it mu&s;t now be evident to you, that the kingdom which I claim is not of this world. Our Lord here, plainly allows that it is fit and proper for temporal kingdoms to fight in defence of their liberty. His own kingdom is not, indeed, to be defended in this way, which being wholly &s;piritual, con&s;i&s;ting in the obedience of men's wills and affections to the laws of God, is incapable of being directly either injured or defended by the &s;word, as the kingdoms of this world, and men's temporal intere&s;t may.</P>
<P>CORNELIUS, a centurion of the Italian band, was directed by an angel of God to &s;end for Pe|ter, who &s;hould tell him "what he ought to do." <NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Acts. 10.</NOTE> But we do not find that the apo&s;tle di|rected him to quit his military profe&s;&s;ion, or in|timated that it was incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;pirit of chri&s;tianity; which he certainly would have done, had the character of a &s;oldier and a good chri&s;|tian been incompatible.</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tle Paul exhorts the Romans thus: <HI>If it be po&s;&s;ible, as much as lieth in you, live peace|ably with all men.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. 12. 18.</NOTE> Which words plainly im|ply, that notwith&s;tanding all their endeavours to pre&s;erve peace, it might be impo&s;&s;ible for them to live peaceably with all men, or not to con|tend and be at &s;trife with &s;ome; i. e. impo&s;&s;ible in a moral &s;en&s;e, improper, unlawful; for they do not require us to do all which we have a na|tural power to do, for the &s;ake of peace, but on|ly
<PB N="17" REF="012813_0009_0F8AB967D16EB138">
all that we can do con&s;i&s;tently with higher ob|ligations, with our duty in other re&s;pects.</P>
<P>ONCE more&mdash;let me ob&s;erve, that in the apo|calyp&s;e of St. John, where we have a prophetic account of the future &s;tate of the church<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> on earth, till the con&s;ummation of all things, there are &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages which intimate, that the &s;aints of the Mo&s;t High, will fight in their defence again&s;t their enemies; and that though they &s;hall in various in&s;tances be overcome, yet that they &s;hall at length, by an amazing &s;laughter of their per&s;ecutors, obtain for them&s;elves the peaceable enjoyment of that liberty wherewith Chri&s;t hath made them free. <NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Chap. XI. ver. 7.XIII.XIV.19, 20.XVII.14.XIX.14&mdash;21.</NOTE> Now it cannot rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed that the &s;pirit of God would have repre&s;ented his faithful &s;ervants, as thus fighting again&s;t their enemies, and being &s;o favoured by divine providence, as finally to pre|vail over them, if defen&s;ive war was incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>IT is not, however, to be denied that there are &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in the new te&s;tament which &s;eem to forbid all war: particularly, our Saviour's own words in his &s;ermon on the mount. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matthew 5. Romans 12.17, 19.</NOTE> <HI>I &s;ay un|to you that ye re&s;i&s;t not evil&mdash;love your enemies; do good to them that hate you, &amp;c.</HI> And tho&s;e of the apo&s;tle Paul; <HI>Recompence to no man evil for evil.&mdash;Avenge not your&s;elves:</HI> and &s;ome others of

the like import. And from &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed that chri&s;tians are not allowed to defend them&s;elves by force of arms, how vio|lently &s;oever they may be attacked.</P>
<P>GIVE me leave then, to offer a few remarks to take off the force of this objection.</P>
<P N="1">1. WHEN our Saviour forbids us to re&s;i&s;t evil, he &s;eems to have had in view only &s;mall injuries, for &s;uch are tho&s;e which he mentions in the following words, as an illu&s;tration of the precept; &s;miting on the cheek, taking away one's coat, or compelling him to go a mile. And to &s;uch injuries it is oftentimes a point of pru|dence, as well as duty to &s;ubmit, rather than contend. But it does not follow, that becau&s;e we are forbidden to re&s;i&s;t &s;uch &s;light attacks, we may not defend our&s;elves when the a&s;&s;ault is of a capital kind. But,</P>

<P N="3">3. DEFENDING our&s;elves by force of arms again&s;t injurious attacks, is a quite different thing from rendering evil for evil. The latter implies doing hurt to another, becau&s;e he has done hurt to us; the former implies doing hurt to another, if he is hurt in the conflict, on|ly becau&s;e there is no other way of avoiding the mi&s;chief he endeavours to do us: the <HI>one</HI> pro|ceeds from malice and revenge; the <HI>other</HI> mere|ly from &s;elf-love, and a ju&s;t concern for our own happine&s;s, and argues no ill will again&s;t any man.</P>

Small injuries, that are not likely to be attended with any very per|nicious con&s;equences, are rather to be &s;ubmitted to, than re&s;i&s;ted by the &s;word. Both religion and humanity &s;trongly forbid the bloody deeds of war, unle&s;s they are nece&s;&s;ary. Even when the in|jury offered is great in it&s;elf, or big with fatal con|&s;equences, we &s;hould, if there be opportunity, endeavour to prevent it by remon&s;trance, or by offering to leave the matter in di&s;pute to indiffe|rent judges, if they can be had. If the&s;e endea|vours are un&s;ucce&s;sful, it then becomes proper, to u&s;e more forceable means of re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>A PEOPLE may err by too long neglecting &s;uch means, and &s;hamefully &s;uffer the &s;word to ru&s;t in its &s;cabberd, when it ought to be employ|ed in defending their liberty.

<P>SUBMITTING the foregoing general ob&s;erva|tions to your candor, I go on to hint at &s;ome things proper to be attended to, by every peo|ple, in order to their being in a capacity to de|fend them&s;elves again&s;t encroachments on their liberty.</P>
<P N="1">1. THEY &s;hould endeavor to be united and at peace among them&s;elves. The &s;trength of a &s;ociety, as well as its honour and happine&s;s, de|pends much upon its union. Our Saviour's max|im is founded in rea&s;on, and has been confirmed by the experience of all ages: <HI>Every kingdom di|vided again&s;t it&s;elf is brought to de&s;olation.</HI> When the body politic is divided into parties, and the members make a bu&s;ine&s;s of oppo&s;ing each o|ther, it is in a fair way to ruin. They are not likely to unite in mea&s;ures of defence again&s;t a common enemy, and will therefore lie open to the encroachments of violence and oppre&s;&s;ion, and become an ea&s;y prey to every invader. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">e tyrants of the earth, &s;en&s;ible of this, have com|monly acted upon this maxim, <HI>divide et impera</HI>: let us fir&s;t divide the people, whom we mean to en&s;lave, into parties, and we &s;hall then ea&s;ily bring them under our power.</P>

Society cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t with|out government; and there can be no go|vernment without laws, and a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to laws. If a licentious &s;pirit prevails among a people, a general di&s;po&s;ition to trample upon laws and de|&s;pi&s;e government, they will probably make but a poor figure in defending them&s;elves again&s;t a common enemy; for, in making this defence, there mu&s;t be leaders and followers, &s;ome to command and &s;ome to obey: And, other things being equal, the more a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;ubmit to rule and order prevails among a people, the more likely will they be to defend their liberty a|again&s;t foreign inva&s;ions.

actually or virtually con&s;ented. Though the contrary evil takes its ri&s;e from the weakne&s;s or wickedne&s;s of rulers, yet in every free &s;tate it is the right and duty of all, <HI>&s;ubjects</HI> as well as ru|lers, to u&s;e their influence again&s;t it: And where the &s;ubjects have no <HI>con&s;titutional</HI> right to do any thing to prevent or remove &s;uch an evil, they are already &s;laves, and it may be tho't improper to talk of their defending their liberty; though they ought, doubtle&s;s, to endeavor to recover it.

an helple&s;s prey to the ravages of &s;ome ambiti|ous neighbour: if they are not; they are rai&s;ing up enemies again&s;t them&s;elves at home, and, as it were, &s;etting fire to their own habitations.</P>
<P N="4">4 A PEOPLE who would &s;tand fa&s;t in their liberty, &s;hould furni&s;h them&s;elves with weapons proper for their defence, and learn the u&s;e of them.</P>
<P>IT is indeed an hard ca&s;e, that tho&s;e who are happy in the ble&s;&s;ings of providence, and di&s;po&s;|ed to live peaceably with all men, &s;hould be o|bliged to keep up the idea of blood and &s;laught|er, and expend their time and trea&s;ure to acquire the arts and in&s;truments of death. But this is a nece&s;&s;ity which the depravity of human nature has laid upon every &s;tate. Nor was there ever a people that continued, for any con&s;iderable time, in the enjoyment of liberty, who were not in a capacity to defend them&s;elves again&s;t inva|ders, unle&s;s they were too poor and incon&s;idera|ble to tempt an enemy.</P>
<P>SO much depends upon the military art, in the pre&s;ent day, that no people can rea&s;on|ably expect to defend them&s;elves &s;ucce&s;sfully without it. However numerous they may be, if they are un&s;killed in arms, their number will tend little more to their &s;ecurity, than that of a flock of &s;heep does to pre&s;erve them from the depredations of the wolf: accordingly it is look|ed upon as a point of wi&s;dom, in every &s;tate, to
<PB N="26" REF="012813_0014_0F8ABA8007BBF718">
be furni&s;hed with this &s;kill, though it is not to be obtained without great labor and expence.</P>
<P>IN &s;ome nations the method has been to tru&s;t for defence and &s;ecurity to what is called a STANDING ARMY; a number of men paid by the public, to devote them&s;elves wholly to the mili|tary profe&s;&s;ion; while the body of the people fol|lowed their peaceable employments, without pay|ing any attention to the art of war.</P>
<P>BUT this has ever been thought, by the wi&s;e and prudent, a precarious defence.</P>
<P>SUCH armies are, as to the greater part of them, generally compo&s;ed of men who have no real e&s;tate in the dominions which they are to de|fend; their pay is their living, and the main thing that attaches them to their employers; their manner of life tends to corrupt their morals, and, though they are naturally of the &s;ame tem|per with other men, they &s;eldom continue long in this profe&s;&s;ion, before they become di&s;tingui&s;hed by their vices: So that neither their temporal intere&s;t, nor their regard to virtue can be &s;up|po&s;ed to attach them &s;o &s;trongly to the country that employs them, but that there will always be danger of their being tempted by the promi&s;e of larger pay to betray their tru&s;t, and turn their arms again&s;t it. No people therefore, can with &s;afety tru&s;t intirely to a &s;tanding army, even for defence again&s;t foreign enemies.</P>
<P>BUT without any &s;uch enemy, a &s;tanding army may be fatal to the happine&s;s and liberty
<PB N="27" REF="012813_0014_0F8ABA8007BBF718">
of a community. <HI>They</HI> generally propagate cor|ruption and vice where they re&s;ide, they fre|quently in&s;ult and abu&s;e the unarmed and de|fencele&s;s people: When there is any difference between rulers and &s;ubjects, they will general|ly be on the &s;ide of the former, and ready to a&s;|&s;i&s;t them in oppre&s;&s;ing and en&s;laving the latter. For though they are really &s;ervants of the peo|ple, and paid by them; yet this is not common|ly done in their name; but in the name of the &s;upreme magi&s;trate.

For rulers to u&s;e a military power, to enforce mea|&s;ures of a contrary tendency, is one of the wick|ede&s;t and mo&s;t unju&s;tifiable kinds of offen&s;ive war; a violation not only of the common laws of ju&s;tice and humanity, but of their own &s;acred engagements to promote the public good.

<P>A &s;afer way, and which has always been e&s;|teemed the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t, by impartial men, is to have the power of defence in the body of the people, to have a well-regulated and well-di&s;ciplined militia. <NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Our trained bands are the tru&s;tie&s;t and mo&s;t proper &s;trength of a free nation.

and ought therefore, to the be&s;t of our power to defend it. The &s;ervant, who hid his talent in a napkin, is condemned in our Lord's parable; and he who through inattention, indolence or cowardi&s;e, &s;uffers it to be wre&s;ted from him, is little le&s;s criminal. Should a per&s;on, for in|&s;tance, who&s;e ability and circum&s;tances enable him to do good in the world, to relieve his di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed brethren, and be an example of charity and other virtues, tamely yield up all his inte|re&s;t and become an ab&s;olute &s;lave to &s;ome unju&s;t and wicked oppre&s;&s;or, when he might by a man|ly re&s;i&s;tance have &s;ecured his liberty, would he not be guilty of great unfaithfulne&s;s to God, and ju&s;t|ly liable to his condemnation? This would in its con&s;equences be really wor&s;e than hiding his talent in a napkin; it would be not only not im|proving it for the glory of the giver, but con|veying it into hands which will, in all probability, employ it greatly to his di&s;honour. This rea|&s;oning is as applicable to a community as to an in|dividual. A kingdom or common wealth, as &s;uch, is accountable for the improvement it makes of it's advantages: It is bound to pre&s;erve them, and employ them for the honour of God; &s;o far as it can, to be an example of virtue to neighbouring communities, and afford them re|lief when they are in di&s;tre&s;s: but by yielding up their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and liberties to an en|croaching oppre&s;&s;ive power, they become, in a great mea&s;ure, incapable of the&s;e duties, and are liable to be made the mini&s;ters of &s;in through the compul&s;ion of their ma&s;ters.

<P>THE regard which we owe to the happine&s;s of others makes this a duty.</P>
<P>EVERY man is bound both by the law of na|ture and revelation, to provide in the be&s;t man|ner he can, for the temporal happine&s;s of his family; and he that neglects this, has, accord|ing to the declaration of an in&s;pired apo&s;tle, <HI>denied the faith, and is wor&s;e than an infidel.</HI> But in what way can a man be more ju&s;tly charge|able with this neglect, than by &s;uffering him&s;elf
<PB N="33" REF="012813_0017_0F8ABA82A7426A40" MS="y">
to be deprived of his life, liberty or property, when he might lawfully have pre&s;erved them?</P>
<P>REASON, humanity and religion, all con&s;pire to teach us, that we ought in the be&s;t manner we can, to provide for the happine&s;s of po&s;terity. We are allied to them by the common tie of na|ture: They are not here to act their part: A concern for them is a debt which we owe for the care which our progenitors took for us: Hea|ven has made us their guardians, and intru&s;ted to our care their liberty, honour, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ppine&s;s: For when they come upon the &s;tage, they will be deeply affected by the tran&s;actions of their fa|thers, e&s;pecially by their public tran&s;actions. If the pre&s;ent inhabitants of a country &s;ubmit to &s;lavery, &s;lavery is the inheritance which they will leave to their children. And who that has the bowels of a father, or even the common feelings of humanity, can think without horror, of being the means of &s;ubjecting unborn millions to the iron &s;cepter of tyranny?</P>
<P>BUT further; a regard to the happine&s;s of mankind in general, makes it a duty to re&s;i&s;t great injuries. Yielding to the unju&s;t demands of bad men, not only le&s;&s;ens our power of do|ing good, but encourages them to repeat their injuries, and &s;trengthens their hands to do mi&s;|chief: It enables them to give fuller &s;cope to their lu&s;ts, and more effectually to &s;pread cor|ruption, di&s;tre&s;s and mi&s;ery. It is therefore an act of benevolence to oppo&s;e and de&s;troy that power which is employed in injuring others&punc;
<PB N="34" REF="012813_0018_0F8ABA835A376530">
and as much, when it is that of a tyrant, as of a wild bea&s;t.</P>
<P>ONCE more; from a regard to religion men are obliged to defend their liberty again&s;t en|croachments, though the attack &s;hould not im|mediately affect religion. Slavery expo&s;es to many temptations to vice, and by deba&s;ing and weakening the mind, de&s;troying its fortitude and magnimity renders it le&s;s capable of re&s;i&s;ting them, and creates a dependance upon, and &s;ub|jection to wicked men, highly prejudicial to vir|tue. Hence it has been often ob&s;erved, and is confirmed by experience, that the lo&s;s of liberty is &s;oon followed by the lo&s;s of all virtue and re|ligon. <NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot"><L>"The conquer'd al&s;o, and in&s;lav'd by war</L>

<P>BESIDES; the de&s;truction of civil liberty is generally fatal to <HI>religious.</HI> The latter has &s;el|dom exi&s;ted long in any place without the for|mer. Nor is it to be expected that tho&s;e who are wicked enough to deprive a people of <HI>that,</HI> &s;hould, when they have got them under their power, &s;uffer them long to enjoy <HI>this</HI>; e&s;pecial|ly as tyranny has generally made the&s;e two evils &s;ub&s;ervient to each other.</P>
<P>BUT I may not enlarge: The con&s;iderations which have been &s;ugge&s;ted &s;hew, if I mi&s;take not, that it is not only the right but the duty of
<PB N="35" REF="012813_0018_0F8ABA835A376530">
men to defend that liberty, with which provi|dence has made them free: And a duty of high obligation, as the neglect of it may be attended with con&s;equences, the mo&s;t prejudicial to hu|man virtue and happine&s;s, and greatly di&s;hono|rary to God.</P>
<P>ALL that now remains is to offer &s;ome re|flections, and apply the &s;ubject to the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>
<P N="1">1. WHAT has been &s;aid may &s;erve to cau|tion all again&s;t invading the liberty of others: &mdash; Whoever does this, obliges others to re&s;i&s;t him: he puts him&s;elf into a &s;tate of war with them, and is ju&s;tly liable to all the evil which their nece&s;&s;ary &s;elf-defence may bring up|on him. And though he may think that his power is &s;o great, and their's &s;o little, that he can be in no danger from their re&s;entment, the event may convince him of his mi&s;take. Men, who have a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e and value of liberty, will &s;ometimes do wonders in its defence.</P>

<P>OPPRESSORS may indeed for a time, be &s;ucce&s;sful and overcome all oppo&s;ition; yet it &s;eldom hap|pens that they per&s;evere in their injurious practice, without meeting with &s;uch re&s;i&s;tance as cau&s;es their <HI>mi&s;chief to return upon their own heads, and their violent dealings to come down upon their own

<P N="2">2. IF it be &s;o important a duty for men to re&s;i&s;t encroachments upon their liberty; then it cannot be improper for the chri&s;tian mini&s;ter, to inculcate <HI>this</HI> upon his hearers; to exhort them to be watchful over it, and ready to oppo&s;e all attempts again&s;t it. This is &s;o far from being improper, that it is, I humbly conceive, his in|di&s;pen&s;ible duty. Nor can I &s;ee how he could an&s;wer it to God, or his own con&s;cience, if, when he thought his country was in danger of being en&s;laved, for want of a proper &s;en&s;e of, and oppo&s;ition to the approaches of tyranny, he &s;hould neglect to point out the danger, and with

<P>IT is readily owned, that <HI>de&s;ignedly</HI> to &s;pread fal&s;e alarms, to fill the minds of people with groundle&s;s prejudices again&s;t their rulers, or a neighbouring &s;tate, to &s;tir up faction and encou|rage oppo&s;ition to <HI>good</HI> government, are things highly criminal; and whoever does thus, whate|ver character he may wear among men, is in re|ality a mini&s;ter, not of Chri&s;t, but of the devil, the father of fal&s;hood, confu&s;ion and rebellion. But to &s;hew people their real danger, point out the &s;ource of it, and exhort them to &s;uch ex+ertions
<PB N="37" REF="012813_0019_0F8ABA840C876D90">
as are nece&s;&s;ary to avoid it, are acts of be|nevolence becoming every di&s;ciple, and e&s;pecial|ly every profe&s;&s;ed mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. SINCE the pre&s;ervation of public liber|ty depends &s;o much upon a people's being po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of the art of war; tho&s;e who exert them|&s;elves to encourage and promote this art, act a laudable part, and are intitled to the thanks of their brethren. Upon this account, the com|pany, which is the occa&s;ion of this &s;olemnity, de|&s;erves to be e&s;teemed <HI>honorable,</HI> though its in&s;ti|tution were much le&s;s <HI>ancient</HI> than it is. And as this &s;ociety has in former days furni&s;hed many brave men, who did worthily in defence of our country; &s;o, from the &s;pirit which at pre&s;ent pre|vails among the gentlemen who compo&s;e it, we doubt not but it will furni&s;h others, whenever there &s;hall be occa&s;ion for it. How far this in|&s;titution, by exciting in others a &s;pirit of imita|tion or emulation, has been the occa&s;ion of the pre&s;ent general attention to the military art a|mong us, I pretend not to &s;ay: But whatever be the cau&s;e, it mu&s;t give plea&s;ure to every friend of public liberty, to &s;ee this people &s;o generally engaged in military exerci&s;es. This argues a manly &s;pirit, a &s;en&s;e of liberty, a ju&s;t apprehen&s;i|on of its danger, a re&s;olution to &s;tand fa&s;t in it, and, as far as any thing in our power can do it, promi&s;es freedom to our country.</P>
<P>WE are not, I hope, in&s;en&s;ible that peace is a great ble&s;&s;ing, and, in it&s;elf, ever to be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="38" REF="012813_0020_0F8ABA84CBCD2228">
to war; nor unthankful to Him who ruleth a|mong the nations, the God of peace, for the en|joyment we have had of this ble&s;&s;ing for a num|ber of years pa&s;t. But we have little rea&s;on to expect, however ardently we may wi&s;h, that this country will always be the habitation of peace. Ambition, avarice, and other unruly pa&s;&s;ions have a great hand in directing the conduct of mo&s;t of the kingdoms of this world. Briti&s;h A|merica is already become con&s;iderable among the European nations for its numbers, and their ea&s;i|ne&s;s of living; and is continually ri&s;ing into greater importance. I will not undertake to decypher the <HI>&s;igns of the times,</HI> or to &s;ay from what quarter we are mo&s;t likely to be mole&s;ted. But from the cour&s;e of human affairs, we have the utmo&s;t rea&s;on to expect that the time will come, when we mu&s;t either &s;ubmit to <HI>&s;lavery,</HI> or defend our liberties by our own &s;word. And this per|haps may be the ca&s;e &s;ooner than &s;ome imagine. No one can doubt but there are powers on the continent of Europe, that would be glad to add North-America to their dominions, and who, if they thought the thing practicable, would &s;oon find a pretence for attempting it. The naval power of Great-Britain has been hitherto our chief &s;ecurity again&s;t inva&s;ions from that conti|nent. But every thing belonging to the pre&s;ent &s;tate, is uncertain and fluctuating. Things may &s;oon be in &s;uch a &s;ituation with Great-Britian, that it will be no longer proper for us to confide in her power, for the protection of our liberty. Our greate&s;t &s;ecurity, under God, will be our be|ing in a capacity to defend our&s;elves. Were we,
<PB N="39" REF="012813_0020_0F8ABA84CBCD2228" MS="y">
indeed, &s;ure that Great-Britain would always be both <HI>able</HI> and <HI>willing</HI> to protect us in our li|berty, which, from pre&s;ent appearances, we have little rea&s;on to expect, it would be &s;hameful for &s;o numerous a people as this, and a people of &s;o much natural &s;trength and fortitude, to be, thro' inattention to the art of war, incapable of bear|ing a part in their own defence. Such weak|ne&s;s mu&s;t render them contemptible to all the world.</P>
<P>BRITISH America, e&s;pecially the nothern part of it, is by its &s;ituation calculated to be a nur&s;e|ry of heroes. Nothing is wanting but our own care and application to make us, with the neigh|bouring colonies, a formidable people. And re|ligion, honor, patrioti&s;m, and even &s;elf-love, all unite in demanding from us this application and care. This people, it may be pre&s;umed, will never of choice, keep among them a <HI>&s;tand|ing army</HI> in time of peace: Virtue, do|me&s;tic peace, the in&s;ulted walls of our State-Hou&s;e, and even the once crim&s;oned <HI>&s;tones of the &s;treet,</HI> all loudly <HI>cry out</HI> again&s;t this mea&s;ure. But every well-wi&s;her to the public, &s;hould coun|tenance and encourage a military &s;pirit among our militia through the province.</P>
<P>OUR political Fathers have it in their power to do much for this end; and we have a right to expect that, out of faithfulne&s;s to God and this people, they will not neglect it. From the coun|tenance which his Excellency and the honorable Council &s;hew to the military tran&s;actions of this
<PB N="40" REF="012813_0021_0F8ABA85B87E99C8">
day, we would gladly hope, that, they in conjunc|tion with the other branch of the legi&s;lature, will, in this way, as well as others, prove them|&s;elves to be God's mini&s;ters for good to the peo|ple.</P>
<P>IT is al&s;o in the power of per&s;ons of rank and fortune, in their private capacity, greatly to pro|mote this cau&s;e by their example and otherwi&s;e. It is highly ab&s;urd, though not uncommon, that tho&s;e who have mo&s;t to lo&s;e by the de&s;truction of a &s;tate, &s;hould be lea&s;t capable of bearing a part in its defence. Riches are frequently the main temptation to war. Where a people are all poor, there is little danger of their being inva|ded: So that there being men of affluence a|mong a people, is often the cau&s;e of their being obliged to defend them&s;elves by the &s;word. It is therefore e&s;pecially <HI>their</HI> duty, as well as inte|re&s;t, to do what they can to put the people into a capacity of defence. When <HI>they</HI> &s;pend their time in idlene&s;s, effeminating plea&s;ures, or even in accumulating riches, to the total neglect of the art of war, and every mea&s;ure to promote it, they act unbecoming good members of &s;ociety, and &s;et an example highly prejudicial to the com|munity.</P>
<P>WHEREAS when gentlemen of fortune, not|with&s;tanding the allurements of plea&s;ure on the one hand, and the fatiguing exerci&s;e of a &s;oldier on the other, exert them&s;elves to acquire and pro|mote the military art, they are an honor to their circum&s;tances, and a ble&s;&s;ing to the public:
<PB N="41" REF="012813_0021_0F8ABA85B87E99C8">
Their example will have great influence upon o|thers; and, other things being equal, &s;uch men will be mo&s;t likely to fight valiantly in defence of their liberty, whenever it &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary. By &s;uch a conduct, they &s;hew their regard to their country, in a way that will probably be much more beneficial to it, than merely talking, writing, or preaching in favor of liberty. And it ought to be e&s;teemed as no incon&s;iderable evi|dence, among many others, of a public, truly patriotic &s;pirit in the honorable gentleman, <NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">The Hon. JOHN HANCOCK, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></NOTE> who leads his Excellency's company of Cadets, that he has &s;o chearfully endured the fatigue of qualifying him&s;elf to be a good officer, and, by his generous exertions in conjunction with their own, rendered his company an honour to the town, to their commanders and them&s;elves. This company in general, is indeed an example of what I was urging; of gentlemen of ea&s;y circum|&s;tances giving proper attention to the art of war, and is on that account the more re&s;pectable and important.</P>
<P>BUT we have other laudable examples of attention to arms. The Train of Artillery <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A Company commanded by <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> PADDOCK.</NOTE> has for a number of years pa&s;t been honorably di&s;tingui&s;hed, by their military addre&s;s. And the re&s;pectable appearance which the whole mi|litia of the town made a few days ago, when cal|led together in honor of his Maje&s;ty's birth-day, and the dexterity with which they went through their exerci&s;es, mu&s;t convince all who had the
<PB N="42" REF="012813_0022_0F8ABA866CFC5F68">
&s;atisfaction of &s;eeing them, that they are no &s;trangers to a military &s;pirit, and lead us to hope that by per&s;everance, the whole body will &s;oon equal tho&s;e, who at pre&s;ent excel mo&s;t. May this &s;pirit &s;till revive and prevail through the province, till this whole people become as con&s;i|derable for their &s;kill in arms, as they are for their natural &s;trength and courage.</P>
<P>THE gentlemen who are engaged in acquiring this art will remember that the true end of it is only defence; that it is to be employed, not to de&s;troy, but to protect and &s;ecure the li|berty and happine&s;s of mankind; not to infringe the rights of others, but to defend their own. While, therefore, they endeavor to re&s;emble &s;uch men as <HI>Alexander</HI> and <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> in military &s;kill and valour, they will dete&s;t the principles from which they acted, in invading and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing inoffen|&s;ive people. For though they have been honor|ed with the name of heroes, they were, in reali|ty, public robbers and murderers.</P>
<P>THEY will al&s;o remember that the mo&s;t de|&s;irable liberty, and which we &s;hould be ready to defend, is that of a well governed &s;ociety, which is as e&s;&s;entially different from that licentiou&s;ne&s;s, which is without law or government, as it is from an ab&s;olute &s;ubjection to the arbitrary will of a|nother. This is the liberty wherewith Chri&s;t has made us free; to which he has given us a right. While, therefore, the&s;e gentle|men will be always ready to &s;tand forth in de|fence of true civil liberty, whenever they &s;hall &s;ee her a&s;&s;aulted, and be properly called upon; they will never on any con&s;ideration be prevailed
<PB N="43" REF="012813_0022_0F8ABA866CFC5F68">
with, to employ their arms for the de&s;truction of good government, by aiding either tyranny on the one hand, or licentiou&s;ne&s;s on the other.</P>
<P>BUT above all they will remember, that reli|gion is the main concern of man, and a nece&s;&s;a|ry qualification for a good &s;oldier. This, be|yond any thing el&s;e, in&s;pires with the love of li|berty, with fortitude and magnanimity; and this alone can enable them to meet death with a rational compo&s;ure and tranquility of mind, which is an enemy before which the brave&s;t &s;ol|dier mu&s;t fall at la&s;t.</P>
<P>TO conclude: This whole a&s;&s;embly will bear in mind, that there is another and more valuable kind of liberty, than that to which the foregoing di&s;cour&s;e more immediately relates, and which, at this day, &s;o generally employs our attention and conver&s;ation; a liberty, which con&s;i&s;ts in being free from the power and dominion of &s;in, through the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the divine &s;pirit, con|curring with our own pious, rational and per&s;e|vering endeavours. Whatever our outward cir|cum&s;tances may be, if we are de&s;titute of this &s;piritual liberty, we are in reality &s;laves, how much &s;oever we may hate the name; if we po&s;|&s;e&s;s it we are <HI>free indeed</HI>: And our being free in this &s;en&s;e, will give us the be&s;t grounds to hope for temporal freedom, through the favour of heaven; and, at length, gain us admi&s;&s;ion into the regions of perfect and uninterrupted liberty, peace and happine&s;s&punc;</P>
