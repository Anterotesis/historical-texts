<P>Brethren, I count not my &s;elf to have apprehended; but this one Thing I do; forgetting tho&s;e Things which are behind, and reaching forth unto tho&s;e Things which are before, I pre&s;s toward the Mark for the Prize of the high-Calling of GOD in CHRIST JESUS.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS, my Brethren, and Friends, is a Day which many Years pa&s;t I did not expect to have &s;een. It brings me within a Month of fini&s;hing the &s;eventy-&s;econd Year of my Life; and this Day will fini&s;h the fiftieth Year of my Mini&s;try among you: a Length of Time unfrequently employed in this Work; which it has plea&s;ed GOD, the &s;overeign Arbiter of Life and Death, of his Mer|cy and good Plea&s;ure, to continue to me; to Him be the Glory and Prai&s;e for it.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="013083_0004_0F8EBDC214A43DA0">HAVING been de&s;ired to entertain you with a Di&s;cour&s;e on this Occa&s;ion, I would willingly endeavor to &s;tir up your Minds, and my own, to &s;uitable Reflections on &s;ome pa&s;&s;ed Events of divine Providence towards us, and a &s;uitable Im|provement of them, and endeavor to animate us to more earne&s;t and vehement A&s;pirations after Chri&s;tian Improvements and Perfections; to which Purpo&s;e I judged the Words of my Text not to be improper: They are Words written by the Apo&s;tle Paul, when he was advanced in Years, and had the Pro&s;pect of a not far di&s;tant De|parture from this World. The Epi&s;tle is &s;uppo|&s;ed to have been written in the eighth Year of Nero, the 62d of our Lord, when the Apo&s;tle was in Bonds at Rome the fir&s;t Time: From which he intimates his Expectation of Deliverance; and it &s;eems he was delivered from that Chain, but was again committed to Bands, and put to Death at Rome. It &s;eems the Church of the Philippians, though a flouri&s;hing Church, was di&s;turbed by judaizing Teachers, who endeavored to keep up the Law of Mo&s;es, and mix the Ob&s;ervances of it with the Doctrine of Chri&s;t, and his In&s;titutions. And the Apo&s;tle begins this Chapter with Warnings again&s;t the&s;e Sedu|cers.&mdash;He propo&s;es him&s;elf as an Example of tru&s;ting in Chri&s;t only, and not in his Privileges, nor any outward Advantage as conducive to Ju&s;|tification;
<PB N="7" REF="013083_0005_0F8EBDC227662A98">
nor to be regarded in Compari&s;on with CHRIST, to whom he is re&s;olved to cleave: and rejecting all other Things, he would count him&s;elf an un&s;peakable Gainer, if he had an In|tere&s;t in CHRIST and his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and might be found in him; if he might feel the Efficacy of his Death, and Re&s;urrection, killing Sin in him, and rai&s;ing him up to Newne&s;s of Life. He lets them know that his Heart was upon Heaven as his Happine&s;s, which in the 11th Ver&s;e, is called the Re&s;urrection of the Dead. For though the Souls of the Saints, when they depart, are immediately with CHRIST; yet their Happine&s;s is not compleat 'till the general Re|&s;urrection; and he was willing to do and &s;uffer any Thing, that he might attain it. Viewing him&s;elf in a State of Trial, and Imperfection, he made this Judgment of his Ca&s;e, he pre&s;&s;ed for|ward, and followed after Chri&s;t, endeavoring to get more Grace, and do more Good; not think|ing he had done enough. In the&s;e Ver&s;es he makes continual Allu&s;ion to the Races run in the Olympian Games, where he that run was ever on the Stretch, pre&s;&s;ing forward, without looking back to what he had left behind, keeping the Goal in his Eye, that coming up fir&s;t to the Mark, he might catch the Prize.&mdash;And if &s;uch an one as Paul, that great Apo&s;tle, who had done and &s;uffered &s;o much for CHRIST,

had laboured &s;o abundantly, and was in Deaths &s;o often, was not perfect, nor had obtained the Prize, but mu&s;t &s;till pre&s;s with &s;uch Ardor; what are we? What concerns us, who are &s;o far be|hind him? What continual Diligence and Labour does this Pur&s;uit require?</P>
<P>FROM the Words I &s;hall ob&s;erve three Things as the Subject I &s;hall di&s;cour&s;e on.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. THE olde&s;t and be&s;t of the Mini&s;ters, and Servants of CHRIST, ought to be per&s;uaded they have not yet attained the Mea&s;ures of Grace and Holine&s;s they ought to have.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. THEY &s;hould, in certain Re&s;pects, forget all their pa&s;t Labours and Attainments.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. As long as they live, they &s;hould be fervently pur&s;uing after better Attainments in the Knowlege and Love of CHRIST, and pre&s;&s;ing towards the Perfection to be had in him.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>I. THE olde&s;t and be&s;t of the Mini&s;ters, and Servants of CHRIST, ought to be per&s;uaded they have not yet attained the Mea&s;ures of Grace and Holine&s;s they ought to have.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="013083_0007_0F8EBDC3C9F81408">THE Apo&s;tle Paul, one of the holie&s;t meer Men that ever lived, makes this Judgment of him&s;elf, <HI>I count not my&s;elf to have apprehended.</HI> Was it only a local Heaven that he judged he had not attained? No &s;urely; for not only him|&s;elf, but every Body el&s;e whom he was conver|&s;ant with, certainly knew that he was then on Earth. But he counted he had not yet attained the&s;e Mea&s;ures of Grace, Holine&s;s, and Confor|mity to CHRIST, that Fitne&s;s for Heaven, or &s;o much of Heaven as was attainable in this World.</P>
<P N="1">1. THEY &s;hould count their Knowlege, and Love of Chri&s;t is comparatively &s;mall.&mdash;The doctrinal Knowlege we have of CHRIST, his Per&s;on, Offices and Work, is communicated by the holy Scriptures. With the&s;e the Mini&s;ters and People of GOD may be well acquainted, and under&s;tand the main, yea all Things e&s;&s;ential to Salvation: Yet they may be in many Things mi&s;taken, and not well under&s;tand them. But the Knowlege of Chri&s;t I am &s;peaking of, does e&s;pe|cially intend, the experimental Knowlege of him. Faith in Chri&s;t, a Belief in him, upon the Au|thority, Credit and Veracity of GOD in his Word. A Confidence and Tru&s;t in GOD through him, according to his Promi&s;e. An experimental Know|lege of the Glory and Excellency of his Per&s;on,
<PB N="10" REF="013083_0008_0F8EBDC48D7459E8">
and Offices, and Work; his full Sufficiency.&mdash; How &s;hort do GOD's People come in this, after all their Attainments and Experience? Much Weakne&s;s and Fearfulne&s;s of Heart; Abundance of Corruption; Prejudices ari&s;ing from corrupt Di&s;po&s;itions &s;till remaining; Stirrings of inordi|nate De&s;ires after worldly Things; immoderate Attachments to Creature Relations and Connecti|ons, whereby they are hindered in the Exerci&s;es of Faith and Holine&s;s; perplexed with many Jealou&s;ies and Su&s;picions concerning the Promi&s;es of God, his Love and Grace in CHRIST. What Workings of Self-Righteou&s;ne&s;s&mdash;what Pronity to pride them&s;elves in their own Labours and Services for GOD, to live upon their own Frames and Duties? Even in their Humiliations, how often may they find Pride &s;tarting up, and catch them|&s;elves plea&s;ed with them&s;elves, in&s;tead of glory|ing in CHRIST and living upon him? Self-Ends and De&s;igns, and Vanity intermix with their Zeal and Duty to CHRIST. Many a Time have the be&s;t Men before as much Rea&s;on to groan out as St. Paul did, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.24. <HI>O wretched Man that I am, who &s;hall deliver me from the Body of this Death?</HI> They are at pre&s;ent in a State of Warfare, the Fle&s;h <HI>lu&s;teth again&s;t the Spirit, and the Spirit again&s;t the Fle&s;h, &s;o that ye cannot do the Things that ye would.</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.12. <HI>For we now &s;ee through a Gla&s;s darkly; now I
<PB N="11" REF="013083_0009_0F8EBDC52B056D80" MS="y">
know in Part.</HI> Though their Faith is &s;incere, yet it is weak. Though their Knowlege be right, yet it is &s;mall. Little of the incomprehen&s;ible Glories of CHRIST, and the mi&s;terious Wi&s;dom and Grace of Redemption, is now known by good Men; Things which the Angels de&s;ire to look into. As &s;uch as this is the real S<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">e of the be&s;t of CHRIST's Servants in this World, 'tis needful they &s;hould be per&s;uaded of it, and know it is the Truth. 'Tis needful to keep them humble, and aba&s;e them before GOD; to make them more entirely dependent on CHRIST; to animate their De&s;ires to receive of his Ful|ne&s;s Grace for Grace.</P>
<P N="2">2. THAT their Labours for CHRIST, and the Fruits of them are comparatively little, and of &s;mall Advantage to his Kingdom.&mdash;All the &s;incere Servants, and faithful Mini&s;ters of CHRIST, have an evangelical Righteou&s;ne&s;s; and through the Grace of GOD in CHRIST JESUS will be accepted of GOD. But CHRIST has taught us all to &s;ay, <HI>Luke</HI> 17.10. <HI>When ye &s;hall have done all tho&s;e Things which are commanded you, &s;ay, We are unprofitable Servants: We have done that which was our Duty to do.</HI> How little of Life is employed directly in the Service of CHRIST? If we deduct what is lo&s;t in Childhood, and in childi&s;h Amu&s;ements; in unmeaning Recreations,
<PB N="12" REF="013083_0010_0F8EBDC5E8068178">
and Conver&s;e with the World, and about the Affairs of it: If we except what is &s;pent in &s;leeping, and natural Re&s;t; in the nece&s;&s;ary Repairs of the&s;e feeble Bodies; perhaps not more than a &s;ixth Part will be left for GOD and CHRIST. If through the Grace of GOD we have an ha|bitual Di&s;po&s;ition, whether we eat, or drink, or what&s;oever we do, to do all to the Glory of GOD; yet how often do we forget it, and fail of actually doing &s;o? When we call our pa&s;t Temper and Conduct to Remembrance, how ma|ny imperfections may we find in the be&s;t that we have done? Many Infirmities, many wrong Ends and Views intermix'd with our hone&s;t De|&s;igns and Endeavors. How often do we &s;leep when we think our Hearts awake? Friends, Relations, worldly Comforts, clog and hinder the A&s;pirations of the Soul to GOD and Heaven; and hang like dead Weights upon us. How of|ten do we &s;pend our Time in fruitle&s;s Contro|ver&s;ies, and Contentions for what &s;eems to us to be Truth, and pertaining to Godline&s;s; little conducive to real Religion; and rather divert us from the Practice of the mo&s;t important Things of the Go&s;pel. Perhaps we are rather contending for the Ma&s;tery of our own Wit and Subtilty, than for the Glory of CHRIST, and to bring Souls to GOD and Heaven. Perhaps have been influenced by Fears of Men, or Hopes from them;
<PB N="13" REF="013083_0011_0F8EBDC6A6DE9B78">
di&s;couraged and &s;unk under the Oppo&s;ition of Devils and wicked Men; ready to &s;ay, Our La|bours are vain.&mdash;Si vult decipi decipiatur.&mdash; And how &s;mall is the Fruit of all our Labour? Suppo&s;e we have been &s;ome Way in&s;trumental to turn &s;ome to Righteou&s;ne&s;s, or hope that a Number through our Endeavors have been con|verted and edified; yet alas! how few, compared with the Numbers who remain carnal and un|converted?&mdash;How many are hardened, and wax wor&s;e? What Numbers have we to mourn over, who are going the downward Road, with whom is to be found no real &s;aving Religion, but are neglecting and dropping the very Form of Reli|gion, and grow weary of the Trouble of what indeed they can have no Plea&s;ure in. How does the ble&s;&s;ed Saviour complain, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 49.4. <HI>I have la|bored in vain, and &s;pent my Strength for nought and in vain&mdash;I&s;rael is not gathered.</HI> How little is done by Men, and how much needs to be done? In&s;tead of great Revivals of Religion, don't we &s;ee Religion greatly decay? If we are &s;incere, yet the old Man, and the old Serpent, will prove too hard for us.&mdash;However, if we have been in&s;trumental of &s;ome Good, we have only been In&s;truments&mdash;GOD is the Author of it, we have no Claim to any Thing more than of ha|ving had the Honor and Happine&s;s of being made U&s;e of by him. If we have been Dili|gent,
<PB N="14" REF="013083_0012_0F8EBDC7841C4AB8">
yea and abounding in Labours, yet we &s;hould be annihilated before GOD, and feel as nothing in the View, that the divine Power, through JESUS CHRIST his Grace, does all the Good that is done. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.10. <HI>I laboured more abundantly than they all; yet not I, but the Grace of GOD which was with me.</HI></P>
<P>II. THEY &s;hould, in certain Re&s;pects, forget all their pa&s;t Labours and Attainments.</P>
<P>THIS one Thing I do, &s;ays the Apo&s;tle; q. d. The Sub&s;tance of what I have &s;aid before, and my Re&s;olution now, is to forget the Things that are behind; whatever Services I have done, whatever Attainments I have got; yet I have not attained the Prize. Not that the Apo&s;tle did, or that the Saints of CHRIST ought never to think of them more, as their Encouragement, and Rea&s;ons of Hope and Thankfulne&s;s or com|fortable Evidences of the Truth and Sincerity of their Faith, and Intere&s;t in CHRIST. In this View they ought to remember them, and give GOD the Glory of them, and through Faith plead their Title to the Promi&s;es. So did He|zekiah, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 38.3. <HI>Remember now O LORD, I be&s;eech thee, how I have walked before thee in Truth, and with a perfect Heart, and have done that which is Good in thy Sight.</HI>&mdash; But this for|getting them intends,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="15" REF="013083_0013_0F8EBDC85CC831D0" MS="y">1. THEY mu&s;t be far from re&s;ting in them as if they had done enough, or done &s;ome great Things for CHRIST. To remember pa&s;t Expe|riences of divine Mercy and the good Gifts of GOD, and e&s;pecially &s;piritual Favors, is plea&s;ing to GOD. It is a Duty to keep up thankful Memorials of them, and to give GOD the Glory due to his Name for them. This is recorded in Scripture as the Practice of good Men, and accepted of GOD.&mdash;The Apo&s;tle therefore does not intend that he will &s;hut, or keep them wholly out of his Mind; but that he will not dwell on them, and fancy he has got Grace enough; &s;it down and &s;ing a Requiem to his Soul, conclu|ding his Salvation is &s;ecured, and he has no Need to trouble him&s;elf any further. Since GOD has pardoned his Sins, and is become reconciled to him, he will never recal his Favor, and therefore he has nothing to do but rejoice in his own Security, and need no further Trouble him&s;elf about Sin or Duty.&mdash;Nor may the be&s;t Saints in the World, with all their Attainments and Labours, &s;olace them&s;elves as having done &s;ome great Things for CHRIST, and recollecting what eminent Servants they have been to him; as if he was in their Debt, and much obliged to them; and that for the Labours, they may leave for Novices, or new Beginners. This Sort of For|getfulne&s;s belongs rather to Hypocrites, and proud
<PB N="16" REF="013083_0014_0F8EBAB7DB5FDBB8" MS="y">
pre&s;umptuous Sinners, who have no Grace at all; than to the Faithful, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> eminent Servants of CHRIST. The Servants of GOD &s;hould look on all they have done as little, not worthy to be compared with what yet remains to be at|tained, and the Service they have not done.</P>
<P N="2">2. THEY ought not at all to look to their Labours or Services for their ju&s;tifying Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, nor to look chiefly to them for their Con&s;olation, and the Evidences of their Grace.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t Saint in the World, and the mo&s;t laborious Servant of CHRIST, ought &s;o to forget all his Attainments in Grace, and all his Labours for CHRIST, as to renounce, di&s;claim, and count them nothing at all, as to a ju&s;tifying Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s before GOD. They have not the lea&s;t Hand nor Share in ju&s;tifying them. There is no Po&s;&s;ibility of obtaining Righteou&s;ne&s;s on the Foot of the Covenant of Works. That Cove|nant is broke long &s;ince, and GOD has never propo&s;ed it to any Man &s;ince as a Covenant of Life, nor bid any Man &s;eek or expect Life on that Foundation. That required perfect Obedi|ence, and pronounces <HI>every Man cur&s;ed, that con|tinueth not in all Things that are written in the Law to do them, Gal.</HI> 3.10. Salvation is now to be had only upon the Terms of the Covenant
<PB N="17" REF="013083_0015_0F8EBDC9089DE308">
of Grace: And the mediatorial Righteou&s;ne&s;s of JESUS CHRIST, is that alone Righteou&s;ne&s;s by which any Son of Adam can appear righteous at the Bar of GOD. Our own Obedience or Holine&s;s has no Share in our ju&s;tifying Righteou&s;|ne&s;s: CHRIST and his Righteou&s;ne&s;s alone mu&s;t be that: A Sinner has nothing el&s;e to plead. If a Man depends on any Thing el&s;e, in Whole or in Part, to ju&s;tify him, he mu&s;t &s;tand at the Bar of GOD and in the Judgment of the Law a guilty undone Sinner.&mdash;The holy Attainments, and &s;incere Labours of good Men, may be com|fortable Evidences of their Grace, and they &s;ome|times need to look back to &s;uch Evidences; but 'tis wrong, and a bad Sign, if Per&s;ons make the&s;e their chief Evidences, &s;o as on all Occa&s;ions to go back to their pa&s;t Experiences for Comfort again&s;t the Accu&s;ations of Con&s;cience; to have &s;uch Evidences chiefly or wholly to go to, to clear up their State: and if they can recollect &s;uch Experiences as give them tolerable Ground of Hope, &s;it down quiet without &s;eeking new and larger Experiences, more clear Exerci&s;es of Faith, Repentance, and Love of GOD, and other holy Actings, and a more &s;piritual Temper of Heart. In&s;tead of this Way, GOD's Servants &s;hould count all their pa&s;t Experiences of little Moment, in Compari&s;on of progre&s;&s;ive Holine&s;s, better Expe|riences, and living daily upon CHRIST and his

Fulne&s;s, going out to him for Strength to better Obedience, and a more &s;piritual, holy Temper and Life.</P>
<P N="3">3. They &s;hould count them little in Compa|ri&s;on of what is yet to be obtained from CHRIST, or done for him.&mdash;JESUS CHRIST is the inexhau&s;tible Store, and Trea&s;ure of all Grace. He is able to communicate his Gifts and Graces to the utmo&s;t Degree that the Soul of Man can contain. What good Men have already attained, is little to what they would have, if they were compleatly &s;anctified; the Services they have done but &s;mall, compared with what they might do, if their Hearts were full of GOD, and &s;wal|lowed up in him; in Compari&s;on of that full compleat Holine&s;s which is to be lived and en|joyed, when their Corruptions are all aboli&s;hed, and they fully conformed to the Image of CHRIST. Ver&s;e 11. <HI>If by any Means I might attain to the Re&s;urrection of the Dead.</HI></P>
<P>III. OBSERVATION. As long as they live, the Mini&s;ters and Servants of CHRIST &s;hould fervently follow after better Attainments and Improvements, pre&s;&s;ing to Perfection in CHRIST.</P>

The Mark, the Prize the Chri&s;tian runs for, is GOD, CHRIST, Heaven; that perfect Holine&s;s and Happine&s;s which is attained through the Knowlege and Love of GOD, and CHRIST. Now we are to leave all Things behind, that nothing may in|terrupt the Soul in this ardent Pur&s;uit. It &s;hould reach towards it with utmo&s;t Endeavor, and mind nothing but tho&s;e Exerci&s;es which carry a Man towards it.&mdash;I &s;hall mention &s;ome plain and obvious Rea&s;ons, why the Servants of CHRIST, e&s;pecially they who are aged, ought thus to em|ploy the re&s;t of their Time.</P>

It is the Way which GOD, the Author of all Good and Happine&s;s, has con&s;tituted to bring &s;inful Men to Happine&s;s in this World and the next. If you try all other Ways you can devi&s;e to lengthen out your Privileges, and promote your Pro&s;perity, and

make you happy; try them as much as you plea&s;e and as long as you can, they never will give you Peace and Serenity in your own Minds, they will never give you Satisfaction in their Fruition, they will not lead your Po&s;terity to Re&s;t, nor give Re&s;t to your own Souls. If I had Ten-fold, or Ten Thou&s;and-fold the Strength, and Powers I have, I would willingly employ and &s;pend them all to di&s;&s;uade you from tho&s;e Ways of &s;eeking your Happine&s;s. If I knew this was the la&s;t Sermon I &s;hould ever preach, (and I know not but it may) I would chu&s;e to employ it to recommend, and to per&s;uade you to make Choice of GOD for your Portion, CHRIST for your only and all-&s;ufficient Saviour, and Holine&s;s and Virtue, or Conformity to the moral Image of GOD, as the only Happine&s;s of rational Creatures.</P>
<P>WHETHER you continue together, or be divi|ded from one another, as my la&s;t and mo&s;t ear|ne&s;t Wi&s;h for you, I would wi&s;h you to be hear|tily per&s;uaded, that the Religion of the Go&s;pel, the Holine&s;s, Virtue, Benevolence, which that teaches and pre&s;cribes, is the Sum of all Duty, the be&s;t Policy, the &s;ure&s;t Means to make you great and honorable in the Eyes of GOD, Angels, and all good Men; to make you pro&s;perous, and truly happy.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="013083_0038_0F8EBDE3EA1D95F0">I DARE a&s;&s;ure you in the Name of GOD, and as a Mini&s;ter of CHRIST, that the more religi|ou&s;ly you maintain, and attend to the In&s;titutions of the Go&s;pel, and practice the Virtues of it, the more Ground of Hope there will be, that you and your Po&s;terity will be as happy as you can rea|&s;onably wi&s;h in this World, and ble&s;&s;ed with GOD in that to come.</P>
<P>BUT the more Religion dies out and dwindles away from among you, the more contemptible, mean, di&s;tracted, wretched and accur&s;ed People will you be.&mdash;And now, Brethren, I commend you to GOD, and to the Word of his Grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an Inheritance among all them that are &s;anctified. AMEN.</P>
