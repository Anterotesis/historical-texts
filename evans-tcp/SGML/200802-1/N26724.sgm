<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE public are here pre&s;ented with the la&s;t literary attempt of an author, who&s;e fame has been uncommonly exten&s;ive, and who&s;e talents have probably been mo&s;t admired, by the per&s;ons by whom talents are e&s;timated with the greate&s;t accuracy and di&s;crimination. There are few, to whom her writings could in any ca&s;e have given plea&s;ure, that would have wi&s;hed that this fragment &s;hould have been &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed, becau&s;e it is a fragment. There is a &s;entiment, very dear to minds of ta&s;te and imagination, that finds a melancholy delight in contemplating the&s;e unfini&s;hed productions of genius, the&s;e &s;ketches of what, if they had been filled up in a manner adequate to the writer's conception, would
<PB N="vi" REF="035555_0004_100560AF61FF6A38">
perhaps have given a new impul&s;e to the manners of a world.</P>
<P>The purpo&s;e and &s;tructure of the fol|lowing work, had long formed a favourite &s;ubject of meditation with its author, and &s;he judged them capable of producing an important effect. The compo&s;ition had been in progre&s;s for a period of twelve months. She was anxious to do ju&s;tice to her conception, and recommenced and revi&s;ed the manu&s;cript &s;everal different times. So much of it as is here given to the public, &s;he was far from con&s;idering as fini&s;hed, and, in a letter to a friend di|rectly written on this &s;ubject, &s;he &s;ays, "I am perfectly aware that &s;ome of the incidents ought to be tran&s;po&s;ed, and heightened by more harmonious &s;hading; and I wi&s;hed in &s;ome degree to avail my|&s;elf of critici&s;m, before I began to adju&s;t my events into a &s;tory, the outline of which I had &s;ketched in my mind."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A more copious extract of this letter is &s;ub|joined to the author's preface.</NOTE> The only

friends to whom the author communicated her manu&s;cript, were mr. Dy&s;on, the tran&s;lator of the Sorcerer, and the pre&s;ent editor; and it was impo&s;&s;ible for the mo&s;t inexperienced author to di&s;play a &s;tronger de&s;ire of profiting by the cen&s;ures and &s;en|timents that might be &s;ugge&s;ted.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The part communicated con&s;i&s;ted of the fir&s;t fourteen chapters.</NOTE></P>
<P>In revi&s;ing the&s;e &s;heets for the pre&s;s, it was nece&s;&s;ary for the editor, in &s;ome places, to connect the more fini&s;hed parts with the pages of an older copy, and a line or two in addition &s;ometimes appeared requi&s;ite for that purpo&s;e. Wherever &s;uch a liberty has been taken, the addi|tional phra&s;es will be found inclo&s;ed in brackets; it being the editor's mo&s;t earne&s;t de&s;ire, to intrude nothing of him&s;elf into the work, but to give to the public the words, as well as ideas, of the real author.</P>

<HEAD>AUTHOR'S PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Wrongs of Woman, like the wrongs of the oppre&s;&s;ed part of mankind, may be deemed nece&s;&s;ary by their oppre&s;|&s;ors: but &s;urely there are a few, who will dare to advance before the improvement of the age, and grant that my &s;ketches are not the abortion of a di&s;tempered fancy, or the &s;trong delineations of a wounded heart.</P>
<P>In writing this novel, I have rather en|deavoured to pourtray pa&s;&s;ions than man|ners.</P>
<P>In many in&s;tances I could have made the incidents more dramatic, would I have &s;acrificed my main object, the de&s;ire of
<PB N="x" REF="035555_0008_100560B88AA03AE8">
exhibiting the mi&s;ery and oppre&s;&s;ion, pe|culiar to women, that ari&s;e out of the partial laws and cu&s;toms of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>In the invention of the &s;tory, this view re&s;trained my fancy; and the hi&s;tory ought rather to be con&s;idered, as of woman, than of an individual.</P>
<P>The &s;entiments I have embodied.</P>
<P>In many works of this &s;pecies, the hero is allowed to be immoral, and to become wi&s;e and virtuous as well as happy, by a train of events and circum&s;tances. The heroines, on the contrary, are to be born immaculate; and to act like godde&s;&s;es of wi&s;dom, ju&s;t come forth highly fini&s;hed Minervas from the head of Jove.</P>

[The following is an extract of a letter from the author to a friend, to whom &s;he communicated her ma|nu&s;cript.]</P>
<P>FOR my part, I cannot &s;uppo&s;e any &s;i|tuation more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, than for a woman of &s;en&s;ibility, with an improving mind, to be bound to &s;uch a man as I have de&s;cribed for life; obliged to renounce all the huma|nizing affections, and to avoid cultivating her ta&s;te, le&s;t her perception of grace and refinement of &s;entiment, &s;hould &s;harpen to agony the pangs of di&s;appointment. Love, in which the imagination mingles its bewitching colouring, mu&s;t be fo&s;tered by delicacy. I &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e, or rather call her an ordinary woman, who could endure &s;uch a hu&s;band as I have &s;ketched.</P>
<P>The&s;e appear to me (matrimonial de&s;|poti&s;m

of heart and conduct) to be the peculiar Wrongs of Woman, becau&s;e they degrade the mind. What are termed great misfortunes, may more forcibly im|pre&s;s the mind of common readers; they have more of what may ju&s;tly be termed <HI>&s;tage-effect;</HI> but it is the delineation of finer &s;en&s;ations, which, in my opinion, con&s;titutes the merit of our be&s;t novels. This is what I have in view; and to &s;hew the wrongs of different cla&s;&s;es of women, equally oppre&s;&s;ive, though, from the dif|ference of education, nece&s;&s;arily various.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>ABODES of horror have frequently been de&s;|cribed, and ca&s;tles, filled with &s;pectres and chi|meras, conjured up by the magic &s;pell of genius to harrow the &s;oul, and ab&s;orb the wondering mind. But, "formed of &s;uch &s;tuff as dreams are made of," what were they to the man&s;ion of de&s;|pair, in one corner of which Maria &s;at, endea|vouring to recal her &s;cattered thoughts!</P>
<P>Surpri&s;e, a&s;toni&s;hment, that bordered on di&s;|traction, &s;eemed to have &s;u&s;pended her faculties, till, waking by degrees to a keen &s;en&s;e of angui&s;h, a whirlwind of rage and indignation rou&s;ed her
<PB N="14" REF="035555_0012_100560C168CB0610">
torpid pul&s;e. One recollection with frightful ve|locity following another, threatened to fire her brain, and make her a fit companion for the ter|rific inhabitants, who&s;e groans and &s;hrieks were no un&s;ub&s;tantial &s;ounds of whi&s;tling winds, or &s;tartled birds, modulated by a romantic fancy, which amu&s;e while they affright; but &s;uch tones of mi&s;ery as carry a dreadful certainty directly to the heart. What effect mu&s;t they then have pro|duced on one, true to the touch of &s;ympathy, and tortured by maternal apprehen&s;ion!</P>
<P>Her infant's image was continually floating on Maria's &s;ight, and the fir&s;t &s;mile of intelligence remembered, as none but a mother, an unhappy mother, can conceive. She heard her &s;peaking half cooing, and felt the little twinkling fingers on her burning bo&s;om&mdash;a bo&s;om bur&s;ting with the nutriment for which this cheri&s;hed child might now be pining in vain. From a &s;tranger &s;he could indeed receive the maternal aliment; Maria was grieved at the thought&mdash;but who could watch her with a mother's tenderne&s;s, a mother's &s;elf|denial?</P>
<P>The retreating &s;hadows of former &s;orrows ru&s;hed back in a gloomy train, and &s;eemed to be pictured on the walls of her pri&s;on, magnified by
<PB N="15" REF="035555_0013_100560C2ED2A7060">
the &s;tate of mind in which they were viewed&mdash;Still &s;he mourned for her child, lamented &s;he was a daughter, and anticipated the aggravated ills of life that her &s;ex rendered almo&s;t inevitable, even while dreading &s;he was no more. To think that &s;he was blotted out of exi&s;tence was agony, when the imagination had been long employed to expand her faculties; yet to &s;uppo&s;e her turned adrift on an unknown &s;ea, was &s;carcely le&s;s afflicting.</P>
<P>After being two days the prey of impetuous, varying emotions, Maria began to reflect more calmly on her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, for &s;he had ac|tually been rendered incapable of &s;ober reflection, by the di&s;covery of the act of atrocity of which &s;he was the victim. She could not have imagined, that, in all the fermentation of civilized depravity, a &s;imilar plot could have entered a human mind.&mdash;She had been &s;tunned by an unexpected blow; yet life, however joyle&s;s, was not to be indolently re&s;igned, or mi&s;ery endured without exertion, and proudly termed patience. She had hitherto me|ditated only to point the dart of angui&s;h, and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the heart heavings of indignant nature, merely by the force of contempt. Now &s;he endea|voured to brace her mind to fortitude, and a&s;k her&s;elf what was to be her employment in her dreary cell? Was it not to effect her e&s;cape, to
<PB N="16" REF="035555_0014_100560C54415D278">
fly to the &s;uccour of her child, and to baffle the &s;elfi&s;h &s;chemes of the tyrant her hu&s;band?</P>
<P>The&s;e thoughts rou&s;ed her &s;leeping &s;pirit, and the &s;elf-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion returned, that &s;eemed to have abandoned her in the infernal &s;olitude into which &s;he had been precipitated. The fir&s;t emotions of overwhelming impatience began to &s;ub&s;ide, and re&s;entment gave place to tenderne&s;s, and more tranquil meditation; though anger once more &s;topt the calm current of reflection, when &s;he attempted to move her manacled arms. But this was an outrage that could only excite momentary feelings of &s;corn, which evaporated in a faint &s;mile; for Maria was far from thinking it difficult to endure a per&s;onal in&s;ult with the mo&s;t magnanimous in|difference.</P>
<P>She approached the &s;mall grated window of her chamber, and for a con&s;iderable time only re|garded the blue expan&s;e; though it commanded a view of a de&s;olate garden, and of part of a huge pile of buildings, that, after having been &s;uffered, for half a century, to fall to decay, had undergone &s;ome clum&s;y repairs, merely to render it habitable. The ivy had been torn off the turrets, and the &s;tones not wanted to patch up the breaches of time, and exclude the warring elements, left in
<PB N="17" REF="035555_0015_100560C884D814F0">
heaps in the di&s;ordered court. Maria contem|plated this &s;cene, &s;he knew not how long; or rather gazed on the walls, and pondered on her &s;ituation. To the ma&s;ter of this mo&s;t horrid of pri&s;ons, &s;he had, &s;oon after her entrance, raved of inju&s;tice, in accents that would have ju&s;tified his treatment, had not a malignant &s;mile, when &s;he appealed to his judgment, with a dreadful conviction &s;tifled her remon&s;trating complaints. By force, or openly, what could be done? But &s;urely &s;ome expedient might occur to an active mind, without any other employment, and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ufficient re&s;olution to put the ri&s;k of life into the balance with the chance of freedom.</P>
<P>A woman entered in the mid&s;t of the&s;e reflec|tions, with a firm, deliberate &s;tep, &s;trongly marked features, and large black eyes, which &s;he fixed &s;teadily on Maria's, as if &s;he de&s;igned to intimidate her, &s;aying at the &s;ame time&mdash;"You had better &s;it down and eat your dinner, than look at the clouds."</P>
<P>"I have no appetite," replied Maria, who had previou&s;ly determined to &s;peak mildly; "why then &s;hould I eat?"</P>
<P>"But, in &s;pite of that, you mu&s;t and &s;hall eat
<PB N="18" REF="035555_0016_100560CA0B83EBF8">
&s;omething. I have had many ladies under my care, who had re&s;olved to &s;tarve them&s;elves; but, &s;oon or late, they gave up their intents as they recovered their &s;en&s;es."</P>
<P>"Do you really think me mad?" a&s;ked Maria, meeting the &s;earching glance of her eye.</P>
<P>"Not ju&s;t now. But what does that prove?&mdash;only that you mu&s;t be the more carefully watched, for appearing at times &s;o rea&s;onable. You have not touched a mor&s;el &s;ince you entered the hou&s;e."&mdash;Maria &s;ighed intelligibly.&mdash;"Could any thing but madne&s;s produce &s;uch a di&s;gu&s;t for food?"</P>
<P>"Yes, grief; you would not a&s;k the que&s;tion if you knew what it was." The attendant &s;hook her head; and a gha&s;tly &s;mile of de&s;perate fortitude &s;eemed as a forcible reply, and made Maria pau&s;e, before &s;he added&mdash;"Yet I will take &s;ome refre&s;h|ment: I mean not to die:&mdash;No; I will pre&s;erve my &s;en&s;es; and convince even you, &s;ooner than you are aware of, that my intellects have never been di&s;turbed, though the exertion of them may have been &s;u&s;pended by &s;ome infernal drug."</P>
<P>Doubt gathered &s;till thicker on the brow of
<PB N="19" REF="035555_0017_100560CC5E2C1348">
her guard, as &s;he attempted to convict her of mi&s;take.</P>
<P>"Have patience!" exclaimed Maria, with a &s;olemnity that in&s;pired awe. "My God! how have I been &s;chooled into the practice!" A &s;uf|focation of voice betrayed the agonizing emotions &s;he was labouring to keep down; and conquering a qualm of di&s;gu&s;t, &s;he calmly endeavoured to eat enough to prove her docility, perpetually turning to the &s;u&s;picious female, who&s;e ob&s;ervation &s;he courted, while &s;he was making the bed and ad|ju&s;ting the room.</P>
<P>"Come to me often," &s;aid Maria, with a tone of per&s;ua&s;ion, in con&s;equence of a vague plan that &s;he had ha&s;tily adopted, when, after &s;urveying this woman's form and features, &s;he felt convinced that &s;he had an under&s;tanding above the common &s;tandard: "and believe me mad, till you are ob|liged to acknowledge the contrary." The woman was no fool, that is, &s;he was &s;uperior to her cla&s;s; nor had mi&s;ery quite petrified the life's-blood of humanity, to which reflections on our own mis|fortunes only give a more orderly cour&s;e. The manner, rather than the expo&s;tulations, of Maria made a &s;light &s;u&s;picion dart into her mind with corre&s;ponding &s;ympathy, which various other
<PB N="20" REF="035555_0018_100560CDE453CA18">
avocations, and the habit of bani&s;hing compunc|tion, prevented her, for the pre&s;ent, from exam|ining more minutely.</P>
<P>But when &s;he was told that no per&s;on, except|ing the phy&s;ician appointed by her family, was to be permitted to &s;ee the lady at the end of the gallery, &s;he opened her keen eyes &s;till wider and uttered a&mdash;"hem!" before &s;he enquired&mdash;"Why!" She was briefly told, in reply, that the malady was hereditary, and the fits not occurring but at very long and irregular intervals, &s;he mu&s;t be carefully watched; for the length of the&s;e lucid periods only rendered her more mi&s;chievous, when any vexation or caprice brought on the pa|roxy&s;m of phren&s;y.</P>
<P>Had her ma&s;ter tru&s;ted her, it is probable that neither pity nor curio&s;ity would have made her &s;werve from the &s;traight line of her intere&s;t; for &s;he had &s;uffered too much in her intercour&s;e with mankind, not to determine to look for &s;upport, rather to humouring their pa&s;&s;ions, than courting their approbation by the integrity of her conduct. A deadly blight had met her at the very thre&s;hold of exi&s;tence; and the wretchedne&s;s of her mother &s;eemed a heavy weight fa&s;tened on her innocent neck, to drag her down to perdition. She could
<PB N="21" REF="035555_0019_100560D1457DCAD0">
not heroically determine to &s;uccour an unfortu|nate; but, offended at the bare &s;uppo&s;ition that &s;he could be deceived with the &s;ame ea&s;e as a common &s;ervant, &s;he no longer curbed her curi|o&s;ity; and, though &s;he never &s;eriou&s;ly fathomed her own intentions, &s;he would &s;it, every moment &s;he could &s;teal from ob&s;ervation, li&s;tening to the tale, which Maria was eager to relate with all the per&s;ua&s;ive eloquence of grief.</P>
<P>It is &s;o chearing to &s;ee a human face, even if little of the divinity of virtue beam in it, that Ma|ria anxiou&s;ly expected the return of the attendant as of a gleam of light to break the gloom of idle|ne&s;s. Indulged &s;orrow, &s;he perceived, mu&s;t blunt or &s;harpen the faculties to the two oppo&s;ite ex|tremes; producing &s;tupidity, the moping melan|choly of indolence; or the re&s;tle&s;s activity of a di&s;turbed imagination. She &s;unk into one &s;tate, after being fatigued by the other; till the want of occupation became even more painful than the actual pre&s;&s;ure or apprehen&s;ion of &s;orrow; and the confinement that froze her into a nook of ex|i&s;tence, with an unvaried pro&s;pect before her, the mo&s;t in&s;upportable of evils. The lamp of life &s;eemed to be &s;pending it&s;elf to cha&s;e the vapours of a dungeon which no art could di&s;&s;ipate.&mdash;And to what purpo&s;e did &s;he rally all her energy?&mdash;
<PB N="22" REF="035555_0020_100560D37549EFF0">
Was not the world a va&s;t pri&s;on, and women born &s;laves?</P>
<P>Though &s;he failed immediately to rou&s;e a lively &s;en&s;e of inju&s;tice in the mind of her guard, becau&s;e it had been &s;ophi&s;ticated into mi&s;anthropy, &s;he touched her heart. Jemima (&s;he had only a claim to a Chri&s;tian name, which had not procured her any Chri&s;tian privileges) could patiently hear of Maria's confinement on fal&s;e pretences; &s;he had felt the cru&s;hing hand of power, hardened by the exerci&s;e of inju&s;tice, and cea&s;ed to wonder at the perver&s;ions of the under&s;tanding, which &s;y&s;tem|atize oppre&s;&s;ion; but when told that her child, only four months old, had been torn from her, even while &s;he was di&s;charging the tendere&s;t ma|ternal office, the woman awoke in a bo&s;om long e&s;tranged from feminine emotions, and Jemima determined to alleviate all in her power, without hazarding the lo&s;s of her place, the &s;ufferings of a wretched mother, apparently injured, and cer|tainly unhappy. A &s;en&s;e of right &s;eems to re&s;ult from the &s;imple&s;t act of rea&s;on, and to pre&s;ide over the faculties of the mind, like the ma&s;ter|&s;en&s;e of feeling, to rectify the re&s;t; but (for the compari&s;on may be carried &s;till farther) how often is the exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility of both weakened or
<PB N="23" REF="035555_0021_100560D4FA508720">
de&s;troyed by the vulgar occupations, and ignoble plea&s;ures of life?</P>
<P>The pre&s;erving her &s;ituation was, indeed, an important object to Jemima, who had been hunted from hole to hole, as if &s;he had been a bea&s;t of prey or infected with a moral plague. The wages &s;he received, the greater part of which &s;he hoarded, as her only chance for independence, were much more con&s;iderable than &s;he could reckon on obtaining any where el&s;e, were it po&s;|&s;ible that &s;he, an outca&s;t from &s;ociety, could be permitted to earn a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in a reputable fa|mily. Hearing Maria perpetually complain of li&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, and the not being able to beguile grief by re&s;uming her cu&s;tomary pur&s;uits, &s;he was ea&s;ily prevailed on, by compa&s;&s;ion, and that involuntary re&s;pect for abilities, which tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s them can never eradicate, to bring her &s;ome books and implements for writing. Maria's conver&s;ation had amu&s;ed and intere&s;ted her, and the natural con&s;equence was a de&s;ire, &s;carcely ob&s;erved by her&s;elf, of obtaining the e&s;teem of a per&s;on &s;he admired. The remembrance of better days was rendered more lively; and the &s;entiments then acquired appearing le&s;s romantic than they had for a long period, a &s;park of hope rou&s;ed her mind to new activity.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="035555_0022_100560D6836C4050">
How grateful was her attention to Maria! Op|pre&s;&s;ed by a dead weight of exi&s;tence, or preyed on by the gnawing worm of di&s;content, with what eagerne&s;s did &s;he endeavour to &s;horten the long days, which left no traces behind! She &s;eemed to be &s;ailing on the va&s;t ocean of life, without &s;eeing any land-mark to indicate the progre&s;s of time; to find employment was then to find variety, the animating principle of nature.</P>

<P>EARNESTLY as Maria endeavoured to &s;oothe, by reading, the angui&s;h of her wounded mind, her thoughts would often wander from the &s;ub|ject &s;he was led to di&s;cu&s;s, and tears of maternal tenderne&s;s ob&s;cured the rea&s;oning page. She de&s;canted on "the ills which fle&s;h is heir to," with bitterne&s;s, when the recollection of her babe was revived by a tale of fictitious woe, that bore any re&s;emblance to her own; and her imagina|tion was continually employed, to conjure up and embody the various phantoms of mi&s;ery, which folly and vice had let loo&s;e on the world. The lo&s;s of her babe was the tender &s;tring; again&s;t other cruel remembrances &s;he laboured to &s;teel her bo&s;om; and even a ray of hope, in the mid&s;t of her gloomy reveries, would &s;ome|times gleam on the dark horizon of futurity, while per&s;uading her&s;elf that &s;he ought to cea&s;e to hope, &s;ince happine&s;s was no where to be found.&mdash;But of her child, debilitated by the grief with which its mother had been a&s;&s;ailed before it

&s;aw the light, &s;he could not think without an impatient &s;truggle.</P>
<P>"I, alone, by my active tenderne&s;s, could have &s;aved," &s;he would exclaim, "from an early blight, this &s;weet blo&s;&s;om; and, cheri&s;h|ing it, I &s;hould have had &s;omething &s;till to love."</P>
<P>In proportion as other expectations were torn from her, this tender one had been fondly clung to, and knit into her heart.</P>
<P>The books &s;he had obtained, were &s;oon de|voured, by one who had no other re&s;ource to e&s;cape from &s;orrow, and the feveri&s;h dreams of ideal wretchedne&s;s or felicity, which equally weaken the intoxicated &s;en&s;ibility. Writing was then the only alternative, and &s;he wrote &s;ome rhap&s;odies, de&s;criptive of the &s;tate of her mind; but the events of her pa&s;t life pre&s;&s;ing on her, &s;he re&s;olved circum&s;tantially to relate them, with the &s;entiments that experience, and more matured rea&s;on, would naturally &s;ugge&s;t.&mdash;They might perhaps in&s;truct her daughter, and &s;hield her from the mi&s;ery, the tyranny, her mother knew not how to avoid.</P>
<P>This thought gave life to her diction, her &s;oul
<PB N="27" REF="035555_0025_100560DE2165BA78">
flowed into it, and &s;he &s;oon found the ta&s;k of re|collecting almo&s;t obliterated impre&s;&s;ions very in|tere&s;ting. She lived again in the revived emotions of youth, and forgot her pre&s;ent in the retro&s;|pect of &s;orrows that had a&s;&s;umed an unalterable character.</P>
<P>Though this employment lightened the weight of time, yet, never lo&s;ing &s;ight of her main ob|ject, Maria did not allow any opportunity to &s;lip of winning on the affections of Jemima; for &s;he di&s;covered in her a &s;trength of mind, that excited her e&s;teem, clouded as it was by the mi&s;anthropy of de&s;pair.</P>
<P>An in&s;ulated being, from the misfortune of her birth, &s;he de&s;pi&s;ed and preyed on the &s;ociety by which &s;he had been oppre&s;&s;ed, and loved not her fellow-creatures, becau&s;e &s;he had never been be|loved. No mother had ever fondled her, no fa|ther or brother had protected her from outrage; and the man who had plunged her into infamy, and de&s;erted her when &s;he &s;tood in greate&s;t need of &s;upport, deigned not to &s;mooth with kindne&s;s the road to ruin. Thus degraded, was &s;he let loo&s;e on the world; and virtue, never nouri&s;hed by affection, a&s;&s;umed the &s;tern a&s;pect of &s;elfi&s;h independence.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="035555_0026_100560DFE10C4038">
This general view of her life, Maria gathered from her exclamations and dry remarks. Jemima indeed di&s;played a &s;trange mixture of intere&s;t and &s;u&s;picion; for &s;he would li&s;ten to her di&s;cour&s;e with earne&s;tne&s;s, and then &s;uddenly interrupt the conver&s;ation, as if afraid of re&s;igning, by giving way to her &s;ympathy, her dear-bought knowledge of the world.</P>
<P>Maria alluded to the po&s;&s;ibility of an e&s;cape, and mentioned a compen&s;ation, or reward; but the &s;tyle in which &s;he was repul&s;ed made her cautious, and determine not to renew the &s;ubject, till &s;he knew more of the character &s;he had to work on. Jemima's countenance and dark hints &s;eemed to &s;ay, "You are an extraordinary woman; but let me con&s;ider, this may be one of your lucid inter|vals." Nay, the very energy of Maria's character, made her &s;u&s;pect that the extraordinary anima|tion &s;he perceived might be the effect of madne&s;s. "Should her hu&s;band then &s;ub&s;tantiate his charge, and get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her e&s;tate, from whence would come the promi&s;ed annuity, or more de|&s;ired protection? Be&s;ides, might not a woman, anxious to e&s;cape, conceal &s;ome of the circum|&s;tances which made again&s;t her? Was truth to be expected from one who had been entrapped, kindnapped, in the mo&s;t fraudulent manner?"</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="035555_0027_100560E20E48E410">
In this train Jemima continued to argue, the moment after compa&s;&s;ion and re&s;pect &s;eemed to make her &s;werve; and &s;he &s;till re&s;olved not to be wrought on to do more than &s;often the rigour of confinement, till &s;he could advance on &s;urer ground.</P>
<P>Maria was not permitted to walk in the gar|den; but &s;ometimes from her window, &s;he turned her eyes from the gloomy walls, in which &s;he pined life away, on the poor wretches who &s;trayed along the walks, and contemplated the mo&s;t terrific of ruins&mdash;that of a human &s;oul. What is the view of the fallen column, the mould|ering arch, of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite workman&s;hip, when compared with this living memento of the fragility, the in&s;tability, of rea&s;on, and the wild luxuriancy of noxious pa&s;&s;ions? Enthu&s;ia&s;m turned adrift, like &s;ome rich &s;tream overflowing its banks, ru&s;hes forward with de&s;tructive velocity, in&s;piring a &s;ublime concentration of thought. Thus thought Maria&mdash;The&s;e are the ravages over which humanity mu&s;t ever mournfully ponder, with a degree of angui&s;h not excited by crumbling marble, or cankering bra&s;s, unfaithful to the tru&s;t of monumental fame. It is not over the decaying productions of the mind, embodied with the hap|pie&s;t art, we grieve mo&s;t bitterly. The view of
<PB N="30" REF="035555_0028_100560E59723F340">
what has been done by man, produces a melan|choly, yet aggrandizing, &s;en&s;e of what remains to be atchieved by human intellect; but a mental convul&s;ion, which, like the deva&s;tation of an earth|quake, throws all the elements of thought and imagination into confu&s;ion, makes comtemplation giddy, and we frequently a&s;k on what ground we our&s;elves &s;tand.</P>
<P>Melancholy and imbecility marked the features of the wretches allowed to breathe at large; for the frantic, tho&s;e who in a &s;trong imagination had lo&s;t a &s;en&s;e of woe, were clo&s;ely confined. The playful tricks and mi&s;chievous devices of their di&s;turbed fancy, that &s;uddenly broke out, could not be guarded again&s;t, when they were permitted to enjoy any portion of freedom; for, &s;o active was their imagination, that every new object which accidentally &s;truck their &s;en&s;es, awoke to phrenzy their re&s;tle&s;s pa&s;&s;ions; as Maria learned from the burden of their ince&s;&s;ant rav|ings.</P>
<P>Sometimes, with a &s;trict injunction of &s;ilence, Jemima would allow Maria, at the clo&s;e of even|ing, to &s;tray along the narrow avenues that &s;epa|rated the dungeon-like apartments, leaning on her arm. What a change of &s;cene! Maria wi&s;hed
<PB N="31" REF="035555_0029_100560E71CD7A6D8">
to pa&s;s the thre&s;hold of her pri&s;on, yet, when by chance &s;he met the eye of rage glaring on her, yet unfaithful to its office, &s;he &s;hrunk back with more horror and affright, than if &s;he had &s;tum|bled over a mangled corp&s;e. Her bu&s;y fancy pictured the mi&s;ery of a fond heart, watching over a friend thus e&s;tranged, ab&s;ent, though pre|&s;ent&mdash;over a poor wretch lo&s;t to rea&s;on and the &s;ocial joys of exi&s;tence; and lo&s;ing all con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of mi&s;ery in its exce&s;s. What a ta&s;k, to watch the light of rea&s;on quivering in the eye, or with agonizing expectation to catch the beam of recollection; tantalized by hope, only to feel de&s;|pair more keenly, at finding a much loved face or voice, &s;uddenly remembered, or pathetically im|plored, only to be immediately forgotten, or viewed with indifference or abhorrence!</P>
<P>The heart-rending &s;igh of melancholy &s;unk into her &s;oul; and when &s;he retired to re&s;t, the petri|fied figures &s;he had encountered, the only human forms &s;he was doomed to ob&s;erve, haunting her dreams with tales of my&s;terious wrongs, made her wi&s;h to &s;leep to dream no more.</P>
<P>Day after day rolled away, and tedious as the pre&s;ent moment appeared, they pa&s;&s;ed in &s;uch an unvaried tenor, Maria was &s;urprized to find that
<PB N="32" REF="035555_0030_100560E96A7D7100">
&s;he had already been &s;ix weeks buried alive, and yet had &s;uch faint hopes of effecting her enlarge|ment. She was earne&s;tly, as &s;he had &s;ought for employment, now angry with her&s;elf for having been amu&s;ed by writing her narrative; and grieved to think that &s;he had for an in&s;tant thought of any thing, but contriving to e&s;cape.</P>
<P>Jemima had evidently plea&s;ure in her &s;ociety: &s;till, though &s;he often left her with a glow of kindne&s;s, &s;he returned with the &s;ame chilling air; and when her heart appeared for a moment to open, &s;ome &s;ugge&s;tion of rea&s;on forcibly clo&s;ed it, before &s;he could give utterance to the confidence Maria's conver&s;ation in&s;pired.</P>
<P>Di&s;couraged by the&s;e changes, Maria relap&s;ed into de&s;pondency, when &s;he was cheered by the alacrity with which Jemima brought her a fre&s;h parcel of books; a&s;&s;uring her that &s;he had taken &s;ome pains to obtain them from one of the keepers who attended a gentleman confined in the oppo|&s;ite corner of the gallery.</P>
<P>Maria took up the books with emotion.&mdash;"They come," &s;aid &s;he, "perhaps, from a wretch condemned, like me, to rea&s;on on the nature of madne&s;s, by having wrecked minds continually
<PB N="33" REF="035555_0031_100560EC6AD9C1D0">
under his eye; and almo&s;t to wi&s;h him&s;elf&mdash;as I do&mdash;mad, to e&s;cape from the contemplation of it.' Her heart throbbed with &s;ympathetic alarm; and &s;he turned over the leaves with awe, as if they had become &s;acred from pa&s;&s;ing through the hands of an unfortunate being, oppre&s;&s;ed by a &s;imilar fate.</P>
<P>Dryden's Fables, Milton's Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, with &s;everal modern productions, compo&s;ed the col|lection. It was a mine of trea&s;ure. Some mar|ginal notes in Dryden's Fables, caught her atten|tion: they were written with force and ta&s;te; and in one of the modern pamphlets, there was a frag|ment left, containing various ob&s;ervations on the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ociety and government, with a comparative view of the politics of Europe and America. The&s;e remarks were written with a degree of generous warmth, when alluding to the en&s;laved &s;tate of the labouring majority, perfectly in uni&s;on with Maria's mode of thinking.</P>
<P>She read them over and over again; and fancy, treacherous fancy, began to &s;ketch a character, congenial with her own, from the&s;e &s;hadowy out|lines.&mdash;"Was he mad?" She re-peru&s;ed the marginal notes, and they &s;eemed the production of an animated, but not of a di&s;turbed imagina|tion. Confined to this &s;peculation, every time
<PB N="34" REF="035555_0032_100560EEB2AFC8C8">
&s;he read them, &s;ome fre&s;h refinement of &s;enti|ment, or acutene&s;s of thought impre&s;&s;ed her, which &s;he was a&s;toni&s;hed at her&s;elf for not having before ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>What a creative power has an affectionate heart! There are beings who cannot live with|out loving, as poets love; and who feel the elec|tric &s;park of genius, wherever it awakens &s;enti|ment or grace. Maria had often thought, when di&s;ciplining her wayward heart, "that to charm, was to be virtuous." "They who make me wi&s;h to appear the mo&s;t amiable and good in their eyes, mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s in a degree," &s;he would ex|claim, "the graces and virtues they call into action."</P>
<P>She took up a book on the powers of the human mind; but her attention &s;trayed from cold argu|ments on the nature of what &s;he felt while &s;he was feeling, and &s;he &s;napt the chain of the theory to read Dryden's Gui&s;card and Sigi&s;munda.</P>
<P>Maria, in the cour&s;e of the en&s;uing day, re|turned &s;ome of the books, with the hope of get|ting others&mdash;and more marginal notes. Thus &s;hut out from human intercour&s;e, and compelled to view nothing but the pri&s;on of vexed &s;pirits, to
<PB N="35" REF="035555_0033_100560F0382E6A70">
meet a wretch in the &s;ame &s;ituation, was more &s;urely to find a friend, than to imagine a coun|tryman one, in a &s;trange land, where the human voice conveys no information to the eager ear.</P>
<P>"Did you ever &s;ee the unfortunate being to whom the&s;e books belong?" a&s;ked Maria, when Jemima brought her &s;upper. "Yes. He &s;ome|times walks out, between five and &s;ix, before the family is &s;tirring, in the morning, with two keep|ers; but even then his hands are confined."</P>
<P>"What! is he &s;o unruly?" enquired Maria, with an accent of di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>"No, not that I perceive," replied Jemima; "but he has an untamed look, a vehemence of eye, that excites apprehen&s;ion. Were his hands free, he looks as if he could &s;oon manage both his guards: yet he appears tranquil."</P>
<P>"If he be &s;o &s;trong, he mu&s;t be young," ob|&s;erved Maria.</P>
<P>"Three or four and thirty, I &s;uppo&s;e; but there is no judging of a per&s;on in his &s;ituation."</P>
<P>"Are you &s;ure that he is mad?" interrupted
<PB N="36" REF="035555_0034_100560F1C11ABED0">
Maria with eagerne&s;s. Jemima quitted the room without replying.</P>
<P>"No, no, he certainly is not!" exclaimed Maria, an&s;wering her&s;elf; "the man who could write tho&s;e ob&s;ervations was not di&s;ordered in his intellects."</P>
<P>She &s;at mu&s;ing, gazing at the moon, and watching its motion as it &s;eemed to glide under the clouds. Then, preparing for bed, &s;he thought, "Of what u&s;e could I be to him, or he to me, if it be true that he is unju&s;tly confined?&mdash;Could he aid me to e&s;cape, who is him&s;elf more clo&s;ely watched?&mdash;Still I &s;hould like to &s;ee him." She went to bed, dreamed of her child, yet awoke exactly at half after five o'clock, and &s;tarting up, only wrapped a gown around her, and ran to the window. The morning was chill, it was the latter end of September; yet &s;he did not retire to warm her&s;elf and think in bed, till the &s;ound of the &s;ervants, moving about the hou&s;e, convinced her that the unknown would not walk in the garden that morning. She was a&s;hamed at feeling di&s;|appointed; and began to reflect, as an excu&s;e to her&s;elf, on the little objects which attract atten|tion when there is nothing to divert the mind; and how difficult it was for women to avoid
<PB N="37" REF="035555_0035_100560F4B013BD40">
growing romantic, who have no active duties or pur&s;uits.</P>
<P>At breakfa&s;t, Jemima enquired whether &s;he under&s;tood French? for, unle&s;s &s;he did, the &s;tranger's &s;tock of books was exhau&s;ted. Maria replied in the affirmative; but forbore to a&s;k any more que&s;tions re&s;pecting the per&s;on to whom they belonged. And Jemima gave her a new &s;ubject for contemplation, by de&s;cribing the per&s;on of a lovely maniac, ju&s;t brought into the adjoining chamber. She was &s;inging the pathetic ballad of old Robin Gray, with the mo&s;t heart-melting falls and pau&s;es. Jemima had half-opened the door, when &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed her voice, and Maria &s;tood clo&s;e to it, &s;carcely daring to re&s;pire, le&s;t a modu|lation &s;hould e&s;cape her, &s;o exqui&s;itely &s;weet, &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately wild. She began with &s;ympathy to pourtray to her&s;elf another victim, when the lovely warbler flew, as it were, from the &s;pray, and a torrent of unconnected exclamations and que&s;tions bur&s;t from her, interrupted by fits of laughter, &s;o horrid, that Maria &s;hut the door, and, turning her eyes up to heaven, exclaimed&mdash;"Gracious God!"</P>
<P>Several minutes elap&s;ed before Maria could enquire re&s;pecting the rumour of the hou&s;e (for
<PB N="38" REF="035555_0036_100560F6D228C5F0">
this poor wretch was obviou&s;ly not confined without a cau&s;e); and then Jemima could only tell her, that it was &s;aid, "&s;he had been married, again&s;t her inclination, to a rich old man, ex|tremely jealous (no wonder, for &s;he was a charm|ing creature); and that, in con&s;equence of his treatment, or &s;omething which hung on her mind, &s;he had, during her fir&s;t lying-in, lo&s;t her &s;en&s;es."</P>
<P>What a &s;ubject of meditation&mdash;even to the very very confines of madne&s;s!</P>
<P>"Woman, fragile flower! why were you &s;uf|fered to adorn a world expo&s;ed to the inroad of &s;uch &s;tormy elements?" thought Maria, while the poor maniac's &s;train was &s;till breathing on her ear, and &s;inking into her very &s;oul.</P>
<P>Towards the evening, Jemima brought her Rou&s;&s;eau's <HI>Heloi&s;e;</HI> and &s;he &s;at reading with eyes and heart, till the return of her guard to extin|gui&s;h the light. One in&s;tance of her kindne&s;s was, the permitting Maria to have one, till her own hour of retiring to re&s;t. She had read this work long &s;ince; but now it &s;eemed to open a new world to her&mdash;the only one worth inhabiting. Sleep was not to be wooed; yet, far from being fatigued by the re&s;tle&s;s rotation of thought, &s;he
<PB N="39" REF="035555_0037_100560F908E30640">
ro&s;e and opened her window, ju&s;t as the thin watery clouds of twilight made the long &s;ilent &s;hadows vi&s;ible. The air &s;wept acro&s;s her face with a voluptuous fre&s;hne&s;s that thrilled to her heart, awakening indefinable emotions; and the &s;ound of the waving branch, or the twittering of a &s;tartled bird, alone broke the &s;tillne&s;s of repo|&s;ing nature. Ab&s;orbed by the &s;ublime &s;en&s;ibility which renders the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of exi&s;tence fe|licity, Maria was happy, till an autumnal &s;cent, wafted by the breeze of morn from the fallen leaves of the adjacent wood, made her recollect that the &s;ea&s;on had changed &s;ince her confine|ment; yet life afforded no variety to &s;olace an afflicted heart. She returned di&s;pirited to her couch, and thought of her child till the broad glare of day again invited her to the window. She looked not for the unknown, &s;till how great was her vexation at perceiving the back of a man, certainly he, with his two attendants, as he turned into a &s;ide-path which led to the hou&s;e! A con|fu&s;ed recollection of having &s;een &s;omebody who re&s;embled him, immediately occurred to puzzle and torment her with endle&s;s conjectures. Five minutes &s;ooner, and &s;he &s;hould have &s;een his face; and been out of &s;u&s;pen&s;e&mdash;was ever any thing &s;o unlucky! His &s;teady, bold &s;tep, and the whole air of his per&s;on, bur&s;ting as it were from a cloud,

plea&s;ed her, and gave an outline to the imagina|tion to &s;ketch the individual form &s;he wi&s;hed to recognize.</P>
<P>Feeling the di&s;appointment more &s;everely than &s;he was willing to believe, &s;he flew to Rou&s;&s;eau, as her only refuge from the idea of him, who might prove a friend, could &s;he but find a way to inte|re&s;t him in her fate; &s;till the per&s;onification of St. Preux, or of an ideal lover far &s;uperior, was after this imperfect model, of which merely a glance had been caught, even to the minutiae of the coat and hat of the &s;tranger. But if &s;he lent St. Preux, or the demi-god of her fancy, his form, &s;he richly repaid him by the donation of all St. Preux's &s;entiments and feelings, culled to gratify her own, to which he &s;eemed to have an undoubt|ed right, when &s;he read on the margin of an im|pa&s;&s;ioned letter, written in the well known hand&mdash;"Rou&s;&s;eau alone, the true Prometheus of &s;en|timent, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the fire of genius nece&s;&s;ary to pourtray the pa&s;&s;ion, the truth of which goes &s;o directly to the heart."</P>
<P>Maria was again true to the hour, yet had fini&s;hed Rou&s;&s;eau, and begun to tran&s;cribe &s;ome &s;elected pa&s;&s;ages; unable to quit either the author or the window, before &s;he had a glimp&s;e of the
<PB N="41" REF="035555_0039_100560FCDBE3D8C8">
countenance &s;he daily longed to &s;ee; and, when &s;een, it conveyed no di&s;tinct idea to her mind where &s;he had &s;een it before. He mu&s;t have been a tran&s;ient acquaintance; but to di&s;cover an ac|quaintance was fortunate, could &s;he contrive to attract his attention, and excite his &s;ympathy.</P>
<P>Every glance afforded colouring for the picture &s;he was delineating on her heart; and once, when the window was half open, the &s;ound of his voice reached her. Conviction fla&s;hed on her; &s;he had certainly, in a moment of di&s;tre&s;s, heard the &s;ame accents. They were manly, and characteri&s;tic of a noble mind; nay, even &s;weet&mdash;or &s;weet they &s;eemed to her attentive ear.</P>
<P>She &s;tarted back, trembling, alarmed at the emotion a &s;trange coincidence of circum&s;tances in&s;pired, and wondering why &s;he thought &s;o much of a &s;tranger, obliged as &s;he had been by his timely interference (for &s;he recollected, by de|grees, all the circum&s;tances of their former meet|ing). She found however that &s;he could think of nothing el&s;e; or, if &s;he thought of her daughter, it was to wi&s;h that &s;he had a father whom her mother could re&s;pect and love.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN peru&s;ing the fir&s;t parcel of books, Maria had, with her pencil, written in one of them a few exclamations, expre&s;&s;ive of compa&s;&s;ion and &s;ympathy, which &s;he &s;carcely remembered, till turning over the leaves of one of the volumes, lately brought to her, a &s;lip of paper dropped out, which Jemima ha&s;tily &s;natched up.</P>
<P>"Let me &s;ee it," demanded Maria impatiently, "You &s;urely are not afraid of tru&s;ting me with the effu&s;ions of a madman?" "I mu&s;t con&s;ider," replied Jemima; and withdrew, with the paper in her hand.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>By the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing intreaties, Maria prevailed on Jemima to permit her to write a reply to this note. Another and another &s;ucceeded, in which explanations were not allowed relative to their pre&s;ent &s;ituation; but Maria, with &s;ufficient ex|plicitne&s;s, alluded to a former obligation; and they in&s;en&s;ibly entered on an interchange of &s;en|timents on the mo&s;t important &s;ubjects. To write the&s;e letters was the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day, and to receive them the moment of &s;un&s;hine. By &s;ome means, Darnford having di&s;covered Maria's window, when &s;he next appeared at it, he made her, behind his keepers, a profound bow of re|&s;pect and recognition.</P>
<P>Two or three weeks glided away in this kind
<PB N="44" REF="035555_0042_100561051657A290">
of intercour&s;e, during which period Jemima, to whom Maria had given the nece&s;&s;ary information re&s;pecting her family, had evidently gained &s;ome intelligence, which increa&s;ed her de&s;ire of plea&s;ing her charge, though &s;he could not yet determine to liberate her. Maria took advantage of this fa|vourable change, without too minutely enquiring into the cau&s;e; and &s;uch was her eagerne&s;s to hold human conver&s;e, and to &s;ee her former protector, &s;till a &s;tranger to her, that &s;he ince&s;&s;antly reque&s;ted her guard to gratify her more than curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>Writing to Darnford, &s;he was led from the &s;ad objects before her, and frequently rendered in|&s;en&s;ible to the horrid noi&s;es around her, which previou&s;ly had continually employed her feveri&s;h fancy. Thinking it &s;elfi&s;h to dwell on her own &s;ufferings, when in the mid&s;t of wretches, who had not only lo&s;t all that endears life, but their very &s;elves, her imagination was occupied with melancholy earne&s;tne&s;s to trace the mazes of mi|&s;ery, through which &s;o many wretches mu&s;t have pa&s;&s;ed in this gloomy receptacle of disjointed &s;ouls, to the grand &s;ource of human corruption. Often at midninght was &s;he waked by the di&s;mal &s;hrieks of demoniac rage, or of excruciating de&s;pair, ut|tered in &s;uch wild tones of inde&s;cribable angui&s;h as proved the total ab&s;ence of rea&s;on, and rou&s;ed
<PB N="45" REF="035555_0043_100561075143CCC0">
phantoms of horror in her mind, far more terrific than all that dreaming &s;uper&s;tition ever drew. Be|&s;ides, there was frequently &s;omething &s;ometing &s;o inconceiveably picture&s;que in the varying ge&s;tures of unre&s;trained pa&s;&s;ion, &s;o irre&s;i&s;tibly comic in their &s;allies, or &s;o heart-piercingly pathetic in the little airs they would &s;ing, frequently bur&s;ting out after an awful &s;ilence, as to fa&s;cinate the attention, and amu&s;e the fancy, while torturing the &s;oul. It was the uproar of the pa&s;&s;ions which &s;he was compelled to ob&s;erve; and to mark the lucid beam of rea&s;on, like a light trembling in a &s;ocket, or like the fla&s;h which divides the threatening clouds of angry heaven only to di&s;play the horrors which darkne&s;s &s;hrouded.</P>
<P>Jemima would labour to beguile the tedious evenings, by de&s;cribing the per&s;ons and manners of the unfortunate beings, who&s;e figures or voices awoke &s;ympathetic &s;orrow in Maria's bo&s;om; and the &s;tories &s;he told were the more intere&s;ting, for perpetually leaving room to conjecture &s;ome|thing extraordinary. Still Maria, accu&s;tomed to generalize her ob&s;ervations, was led to conclude from all &s;he heard; that it was a vulgar error to &s;uppo&s;e that people of abilities were the mo&s;t apt to lo&s;e the command of rea&s;on. On the contrary, from mo&s;t of the in&s;tances &s;he could inve&s;tigate,
<PB N="46" REF="035555_0044_10056108D62F5628">
&s;he thought it re&s;ulted, that the pa&s;&s;ions only ap|peared &s;trong and di&s;proportioned, becau&s;e the judgment was weak and unexerci&s;ed, and that they gained &s;trength by the decay of rea&s;on, as the &s;hadows lengthen during the &s;un's decline.</P>
<P>Maria impatiently wi&s;hed to &s;ee her fellow &s;uf|ferer; but Darnford was &s;till more earne&s;t to ob|tain an interview. Accu&s;tomed to &s;ubmit to every impul&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion, and never taught, like woman, to re&s;train the mo&s;t natural, and acquire, in&s;tead of the bewitching frankne&s;s of nature, a factitious propriety of behaviour, every de&s;ire became a tor|rent that bore down all oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>His travelling trunk, which contained the books lent to Maria, had been &s;ent to him, and with a part of its contents he bribed his principal keeper; who, after receiving the mo&s;t &s;olemn promi&s;e that he would return to his apartment without attempt|ing to explore any part of the hou&s;e, conducted him, in the du&s;k of the evening, to Maria's room.</P>
<P>Jemima had apprized her charge of the vi&s;it, and &s;he expected with trembling impatience, in|&s;pired by a vague hope that he might again prove her deliverer, to &s;ee a man who had before re&s;cued her from oppre&s;&s;ion. He entered with an anima|tion

of countenance, formed to captivate an enthu&s;ia&s;t; and, ha&s;tily turned his eyes from her to the apartment, which he &s;urveyed with apparent emotions of compa&s;&s;ionate indignation. Sympathy illuminated his eye, and, taking her hand, he re&s;pectfully bowed on it, exclaiming&mdash;"This is extraordinary!&mdash;again to meet you, and in &s;uch circum&s;tances!" Still, impre&s;&s;ive as was the coincidence of events which brought them once more together, their full hearts did no over|flow.&mdash;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The copy which had received the author's la&s;t cor|rections, breaks off in this place, and the pages which follow, to the end of Chap.

<P>And though, after this fir&s;t vi&s;it, they were permitted frequently to repeat their interviews, they were for &s;ome time employed in a re&s;erved conver&s;ation, to which all the world might have li&s;tened; excepting when di&s;cu&s;&s;ing &s;ome literary

&s;ubject, fla&s;hes of &s;entiment, inforced by each re|laxing feature, &s;eemed to remind them that their minds were already acquainted.</P>
<P>By degrees, Darnford entered into the particu|lars of his &s;tory. In a few words, he informed her that he had been a thoughtle&s;s, extravagant young men; yet, as he de&s;cribed his faults, they appeared to be the generous luxuriancy of a noble mind. Nothing like meanne&s;s tarni&s;hed the lu&s;tre of his youth, nor had the worm of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s lurked in the unfolding bud, even while he had been the dupe of others. Yet he tardily acquired the experience nece&s;&s;ary to guard him again&s;t fu|ture impo&s;ition.</P>
<P>"I &s;hall weary you," continued he, "by my egoti&s;m: and did not powerful emotions draw me to you,"&mdash;his eyes gli&s;tened as he &s;poke, and a trembling &s;eemed to run through his manly frame,&mdash;"I would not wa&s;te the&s;e precious moments in talking of my&s;elf.</P>
<P>"My father and mother were people of fa&s;hion; married by their parents. He was fond of the turf, &s;he of the card-table. I, and two or three other children &s;ince dead, were kept at home till we became intolerable. My father and mother

had a vi&s;ible di&s;like to each other, continually di&s;|played: the &s;ervants were of the depraved kind u&s;ually found, in the hou&s;es of people of fortune. My brothers and parents all dying, I was left to the care of guardians, and &s;ent to Eton. I never knew the &s;weets of dome&s;tic affection, but I felt the want of indulgence and frivolous re&s;pect at &s;chool. I will not di&s;gu&s;t you with a recital of the vices of my youth, which can &s;carcely be comprehended by female delicacy. I was taught to love by a creature I am a&s;hamed to mention; and the other women with whom I afterwards became intimate, were of a cla&s;s of which you can have no knowledge. I formed my acquaint|ance with them at the theatres; and when viva|city danced in their eyes, I was not ea&s;ily di&s;|gu&s;ted by the vulgarity which flowed from their lips. Having &s;pent, a few years after I was of age, [the whole of] a con&s;iderable patrimony, excepting a few hundreds, I had no re&s;ource but to purcha&s;e a commi&s;&s;ion in a new rai&s;ed regi|ment, de&s;tined to &s;ubjugate America. The re|gret I felt to renounce a life of plea&s;ure, was counter-balanced by the curio&s;ity I had to &s;ee America, or rather to travel; [nor had any of the&s;e circum&s;tances occurred to my youth, which might have been calculated] to bind my country to my heart. I &s;hall not trouble you with the

details of a military life. My blood was &s;till kept in motion; till, towards the clo&s;e of the conte&s;t, I was wounded and taken pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>"Confined to my bed, or chair, by a lingering cure, my only refuge from the preying activity of my mind, was books, which I read with great avidity, profiting by the conver&s;ation of my ho&s;t, a man of found under&s;tanding. My political &s;en|timents now underwent a total change; and, dazzled by the ho&s;pitality of the Americans, I determined to take up my abode with freedom. I, therefore, with my u&s;ual impetuo&s;ity, &s;old my commi&s;&s;ion, and travelled into the interior parts of the country, to lay out my money to advantage. Added to this, I did not much like the puritanical manners of the large towns. Inequality of con|dition was there mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;tingly galling. The only plea&s;ure wealth afforded, was to make an o&s;tentatious di&s;play of it; for the cultivation of the fine arts, or literature, had not introduced into the fir&s;t circles that poli&s;h of manners which renders the rich &s;o e&s;&s;entially &s;uperior to the poor in Europe. Added to this, an influx of vices had been let in by the revolution, and the mo&s;t rigid principles of religion &s;haken to the centre, before the under&s;tanding could be gradually emancipated from the prejudices which led their ance&s;tors
<PB N="51" REF="035555_0049_10056114770FB400">
undauntedly to &s;eek an inho&s;pitable clime and unbroken &s;oil. The re&s;olution, that led them in pur&s;uit of independence, to embark on rivers like &s;eas, to &s;earch for unknown &s;hores, and to &s;leep under the hovering mi&s;ts of endle&s;s fore&s;ts, who&s;e baleful damps agued their limbs, was now turned into commercial &s;peculations, till the national character exhibited a phenomenon in the hi&s;tory of the human mind&mdash;a head enthu&s;ia&s;tically en|terpri&s;ing, with cold &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of heart. And woman, lovely woman!&mdash;they charm every where&mdash;&s;till there is a degree of prudery, and a want of ta&s;te and ea&s;e in the manners of the American women, that renders them, in &s;pite of their ro&s;es and lilies, far inferior to our European charmers. In the country, they have often a bewitching &s;im|plicity of character; but, in the cities, they have all the airs and ignorance of the ladies who give the tone to the circles of the large trading towns in England. They are fond of their ornaments, merely becau&s;e they are good, and not becau&s;e they embelli&s;h their per&s;ons; and are more gra|tified to in&s;pire the women with jealou&s;y of the&s;e exterior advantages, than the men with love. All the frivolity which often (excu&s;e me, madam) renders the &s;ociety of mode&s;t women &s;o &s;tupid in England, here &s;eemed to throw &s;till more leaden fetters on their charms. Not being an adept in
<PB N="52" REF="035555_0050_100561170A66B070">
gallantry, I found that I could only keep my&s;elf awake in their company by making downright love to them.</P>
<P>"But, not to intrude on your patience, I re|tired to the tract of land which I had purcha&s;ed in the country, and my time pa&s;&s;ed plea&s;antly enough while I cut down the trees, built my hou&s;e, and planted my different crops. But winter and idlene&s;s came, and I longed for more elegant &s;ociety, to hear what was pa&s;&s;ing in the world, and to do &s;omething better than vegetate with the animals that made a very con&s;iderable part of my hou&s;ehold. Con&s;equently I determined to travel. Motion was a &s;ub&s;titute for a variety of objects; and pa&s;&s;ing over immen&s;e tracts of country, I exhau&s;ted my exuberant &s;pirits, without obtaining much experience. I every where &s;aw indu&s;try the forerunner and not the con&s;equence, of luxury; but this country, every thing being on an ample &s;cale, did not afford tho&s;e picture&s;que views, which a certain degree of cultivation is nece&s;&s;ary gradually to produce. The eye wandered without an object to fix upon over immea&s;urable plains, and lakes that &s;eemed repleni&s;hed by the ocean, whil&s;t eternal fore&s;ts of &s;mall clu&s;tering trees, ob&s;tructed the circulation of the air, and embar|ra&s;&s;ed the path, without gratifying the eye of

ta&s;te. No cottage &s;miling in the wa&s;te, no tra|vellers hailed us, to give life to &s;ilent nature; or, if perchance we &s;aw the print of a foot&s;tep in our path, it was a dreadful warning to turn a&s;ide; and the head ached as if a&s;&s;ailed by the &s;calping knife. The Indians who hovered on the &s;kirts of the European &s;ettlements had only learned of their neighbours to plunder, and they &s;tole guns from them to do it with more &s;afety.</P>
<P>From the woods and back &s;ettlements, I re|turned to the towns, and learned to eat and drink mo&s;t valiantly; but without entering into com|merce (and I dete&s;ted commerce) I found I could not live there; and, growing heartily weary of the land of liberty and vulgar ari&s;tocracy, &s;eated on her bags of dollars, I re&s;olved once more to vi&s;it Europe. I wrote to a di&s;tant relation in England, with whom I had been educated, mentioning the ve&s;&s;el in which I intended to &s;ail. Arriving in London, my &s;en&s;es were intoxicated. I ran from &s;treet to &s;treet, from theatre to theatre, and the women of the town (again I mu&s;t beg pardon for my habitual frankne&s;s) appeared to me like angels.</P>
<P>"A week was &s;pent in this thoughtle&s;s manner, when, returning very late to the hotel in which I lodged ever &s;ince my arrival, I was knocked down

Still I cannot gue&s;s, though I weary my&s;elf with con|jectures, why I am confined, or in what part of England this hou&s;e is &s;ituated.

<P>PITY, and the forlorn &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of adver&s;ity, have been both con&s;idered as di&s;po&s;itions favour|able to love, while &s;atirical writers have attributed the propen&s;ity to the relaxing effect of idlene&s;s; what chance then had Maria of e&s;caping, when pity, &s;orrow, and &s;olitude all con&s;pired to &s;often her mind, nouri&s;h romantic wi&s;hes, and, from a natural progre&s;s, romantic expectations?</P>
<P>Maria was &s;ix-and-twenty. But, &s;uch was the native &s;oundne&s;s of her con&s;titution, that time had only given to her countenance the character of her mind. Revolving thought, and exerci&s;ed affec|tions had bani&s;hed &s;ome of the playful graces of innocence, producing in&s;en&s;ibly that irregularity of features which the &s;truggles of the under&s;tand|ing to trace or govern the &s;trong emotions of the heart, are wont to imprint on the yielding ma&s;s. Grief and care had mellowed, without ob&s;curing, the bright tints of youth, and the thoughtfulne&s;s which re&s;ided on her brow did not take from the
<PB N="56" REF="035555_0054_10056120139CD7F0">
feminine &s;oftne&s;s of her features; nay, &s;uch was the &s;en&s;ibility which often mantled over it, that &s;he frequently appeared, like a large proportion of her &s;ex, only born to feel; and the activity of her well-proportioned, and even almo&s;t voluptuous figure, in&s;pired the idea of &s;trength of mind, rather than of body. There was a &s;implicity &s;ometimes indeed in her manner, which bordered on infantine ingenuou&s;ne&s;s, that led people of common di&s;cernment to underrate her talents, and &s;mile at the flights of her imagination. But tho&s;e who could not comprehend the delicacy of her &s;entiments, were attached by her unfailing &s;ym|pathy, &s;o that &s;he was very generally beloved by characters of very different de&s;criptions; &s;till, &s;he was too much under the influence of an ar|dent imagination to adhere to common rules.</P>
<P>There are mi&s;takes of conduct which at five-and-twenty prove the &s;trength of the mind, that, ten or fifteen years after, would demon&s;trate its weakne&s;s, its incapacity to acquire a &s;ane judg|ment. The youths who are &s;atisfied with the or|dinary plea&s;ures of life, and do not &s;igh after ideal phantoms of love and friend&s;hip, will never arrive at great maturity of under&s;tanding; but if the&s;e reveries are cheri&s;hed, as is too frequently the ca&s;e with women, when experience ought to have

taught them in what human happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts, they become as u&s;ele&s;s as they are wretched. Be|&s;ides, their pains and plea&s;ures are &s;o dependent on outward circum&s;tances, on the objects of their affections, that they &s;eldom act from the impul&s;e of a nerved mind, able to choo&s;e its own pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>Having had to &s;truggle ince&s;&s;antly with the vices of mankind, Maria's imagination found re|po&s;e in pourtraying the po&s;&s;ible virtues the world might contain. Pygmalion formed an ivory maid, and longed for an informing &s;oul. She, on the contrary, combined all the qualities of a hero's mind, and fate pre&s;ented a &s;tatue in which &s;he might en&s;hrine them.</P>
<P>We mean not to trace the progre&s;s of this pa&s;|&s;ion, or recount how often Darnford and Maria were obliged to part in the mid&s;t of an intere&s;ting conver&s;ation. Jemima ever watched on the tip|toe of fear, and frequently &s;eparated them on a fal&s;e alarm, when they would have given worlds to remain a little longer together.</P>
<P>A magic lamp now &s;eemed to be &s;u&s;pended in Maria's pri&s;on, and fairy land&s;capes flitted round the gloomy walls, late &s;o blank. Ru&s;hing from the depth of de&s;pair, on the &s;eraph wing of hope,
<PB N="58" REF="035555_0056_10056125235BE910">
&s;he found her&s;elf happy.&mdash;She was beloved, and every emotion was rapturous.</P>
<P>To Darnford &s;he had not &s;hown a decided affection; the fear of outrunning his, a &s;ure proof of love, made her often a&s;&s;ume a coldne&s;s and indifference foreign from her character; and, even giving way to the playful emotions of a heart ju&s;t loo&s;ened from the frozen bond of grief, there was a delicacy in her manner of expre&s;&s;ing her &s;en&s;ibility, which made him doubt whether it was the effect of love.</P>
<P>One evening, when Jemima left them, to li&s;ten to the &s;ound of a di&s;tant foot-&s;tep, which &s;eemed cautiou&s;ly to approach, he &s;eized Maria's hand&mdash;it was not withdrawn. They conver&s;ed with ear|ne&s;tne&s;s of their &s;ituation; and during the conver|&s;ation, he once or twice gently drew her towards him. He felt the fragrance of her breath, and longed, yet feared, to touch the lips from which it i&s;&s;ued; &s;pirits of purity &s;eemed to guard them, while all the enchanting graces of love &s;ported on her cheeks, and langui&s;hed in her eyes.</P>
<P>Jemima entering, he reflected on his diffidence with poignant regret, and &s;he once <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> taking alarm, he ventured, as Maria &s;tood near his chair,
<PB N="59" REF="035555_0057_10056126A8FE85A8">
to approach her lips with a declaration of love. She drew back with &s;olemnity, he hung down his head aba&s;hed; but lifting his eyes timidly, they met her's; &s;he had determined, during that in|&s;tant, and &s;uffered their rays to mingle. He took, with more ardour rea&s;&s;ured, a half-con&s;enting, half-reluctant ki&s;s, reluctant only from mode&s;ty; and there was a &s;acredne&s;s in her dignified manner of reclining her glowing face on his &s;houlder, that powerfully impre&s;&s;ed him. De&s;ire was lo&s;t in more ineffable emotions, and to protect her from in&s;ult and &s;orrow&mdash;to make her happy, &s;eemed not only the fir&s;t wi&s;h of his heart, but the mo&s;t noble duty of his life. Such angelic confidence demanded the fidelity of honour; but could he, feeling her in every pul&s;ation, could he ever change, could he be a villain? The emotion with which &s;he, for a moment, allowed her&s;elf to be pre&s;&s;ed to his bo&s;om, the ear <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> rapturous &s;ym|pathy, mingled with a &s;oft melancholy &s;entiment of recollected di&s;appointment, &s;aid&mdash;more of truth and faithfulne&s;s, than the tongue could have given utterance to in hours! They were &s;ilent yet di&s;|cour&s;ed, how eloquently? till, after a moment's reflection, Maria drew her chair by the &s;ide of his, and, with a compo&s;ed &s;weetne&s;s of voice, and &s;upernatural benignity of countenance, &s;aid, "I mu&s;t open my whole heart to you: you mu&s;t be

told who I am, why I am here, and why, telling you I am a wife, I blu&s;h not to"&mdash;the blu&s;h &s;poke the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Jemima was again at her elbow, and the re&s;|traint of her pre&s;ence did not prevent an animated conver&s;ation, in which love, &s;ly urchin, was ever at bo-peep.</P>
<P>So much of heaven did they enjoy, that para|di&s;e bloomed around them; or they, by a powerful &s;pell, had been tran&s;ported into Armida's garden. Love, the great enchanter, "lapt them in Ely|&s;ium," and every &s;en&s;e was harmonized to the &s;ocial extacy. So animated, indeed, were their accents of tenderne&s;s, in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing what, in other circum&s;tances would have been common-place &s;ubjects, that Jemima felt, with &s;urpri&s;e, a tear of plea&s;ure trickling down her rugged cheeks. She wiped it away, half a&s;hamed; and when Maria kindly enquired the cau&s;e, with all the eager &s;oli|citude of a happy being wi&s;hing to impart to all nature its overflowing felicity, Jemima owned that it was the fir&s;t tear that &s;ocial enjoyment had ever drawn from her. She &s;eemed indeed to breathe more freely; the cloud of &s;u&s;picion cleared away from her brow; &s;he felt her&s;elf, for once in her life, treated like a fellow-creature.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<P>"MY father," &s;aid Jemima, "&s;educed my mother, a pretty girl, with whom he lived fellow-&s;ervant; and &s;he no &s;ooner perceived the natural, the dreaded con&s;equence, than the terrible con|viction fla&s;hed on her&mdash;that &s;he was ruined. Ho|ne&s;ty, and a regard for her reputation, had been the only principles inculcated by her mother; and they had been &s;o forcibly impre&s;&s;ed, that &s;he feared &s;hame, more than the poverty to which it would lead. Her ince&s;&s;ant importunities to pre|vail upon my father to &s;creen her from reproach by marrying her, as he had promi&s;ed in the fer|vour of &s;eduction, e&s;tranged him from her &s;o com|pletely, that her very per&s;on became di&s;ta&s;teful to him; and he began to hate, as well as de&s;pi&s;e me, before I was born.</P>
<P>"My mother, grieved to the &s;oul by his ne|glect, and unkind treatment, actually re&s;olved to fami&s;h her&s;elf; and injured her health by the at|tempt; though &s;he had not &s;ufficient re&s;olution
<PB N="63" REF="035555_0061_1005612FECF83118">
to adhere to her project, or renounce it entirely. Death came not at her call; yet &s;orrow, and the methods &s;he adopted to conceal her condition, &s;till doing the work of a hou&s;e-maid, had &s;uch an effect on her con&s;titution, that &s;he died in the wretched garret, where her virtuous mi&s;tre&s;s had forced her to take refuge in the very pangs of la|bour, though my father, after a &s;light reproof, was allowed to remain in his place&mdash;allowed by the mother of &s;ix children, who, &s;carcely permit|ting a foot&s;tep to be heard, during her month's indulgence, felt no &s;ympathy for the poor wretch, denied every comfort required by her &s;ituation.</P>
<P>"The day my mother died, the ninth after my birth, I was con&s;igned to the care of the cheape&s;t nur&s;e my father could find; who &s;uckled her own child at the &s;ame time, and lodged as many more as &s;he could get, in two cellar-like apartments.</P>
<P>"Poverty, and the habit of &s;eeing children die off her hands, had &s;o hardened her heart, that the office of a mother did not awaken the tender|ne&s;s of a woman; nor were the feminine care&s;&s;es which &s;eemed a part of the rearing of a child, ever be&s;towed on me. The chicken has a wing to &s;helter under; but I had no bo&s;om to ne&s;tle in, no kindred warmth to fo&s;ter me. Left in dirt,
<PB N="64" REF="035555_0062_10056132267F3598">
to cry with cold and hunger till I was weary, and &s;leep without ever being prepared by exerci&s;e, or lulled by kindne&s;s to re&s;t; could I be expected to become any thing but a weak and rickety babe? Still, in &s;pite of neglect, I continued to exi&s;t, to learn to cur&s;e exi&s;tence, "her countenance grew ferocious as &s;he &s;poke," and the treatment that rendered me mi&s;erable, &s;eemed to &s;harpen my wit. Confined then in a damp hovel, to rock the cra|dle of the &s;ucceeding tribe, I looked like a little old woman, or a hag &s;hrivelling into nothing. The furrows of reflection and care contracted the youthful cheek, and gave a &s;ort of &s;upernatural wildne&s;s to the ever watchful eye. During this period, my father had married another fellow-&s;ervant, who loved him le&s;s, and knew better how to manage his pa&s;&s;ion, than my mother. She likewi&s;e proving with child, they agreed to keep a &s;hop: my &s;tep-mother, if, being an illegitimate offspring, I may venture thus to characterize her, having obtained a &s;um of a rich relation, for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>"Soon after her lying-in, &s;he prevailed on my father to take me home, to &s;ave the expence of maintaining me, and of hiring a girl to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in the care of the child. I was young, it was true, but appeared a knowing little thing, and
<PB N="65" REF="035555_0063_100561345DF426E0">
might be made handy. Accordingly I was brought to her hou&s;e; but not to a home&mdash;for a home I never knew. Of this child, a daughter, &s;he was extravagantly fond; and it was a part of my employment, to a&s;&s;i&s;t to &s;poil her, by humour|ing all her whims, and bearing all her caprices. Feeling her own con&s;equence, before &s;he could &s;peak, &s;he had learned the art of tormenting me, and if I ever dared to re&s;i&s;t, I received blows laid on with no compunctious hand, or was &s;ent to bed dinnerle&s;s, as well as &s;upperle&s;s. I &s;aid that it was a part of my daily labour to attend this child, with the &s;ervility of a &s;lave; &s;till it was but a part. I was &s;ent out in all &s;ea&s;ons, and from place to place, to carry burdens far above my &s;trength, without being allowed to draw near the fire, or ever being cheered by encouragement or kindne&s;s. No wonder then, treated like a crea|ture of another &s;pecies, that I began to envy, and at length to hate, the darling of the hou&s;e. Yet, I perfectly remember, that it was the care&s;&s;es, and kind expre&s;&s;ions of my &s;tep-mother, which fir&s;t excited my jealous di&s;content. Once, I can|not forget it, when &s;he was calling in vain her wayward child to ki&s;s her, I ran to her, &s;aying, 'I will ki&s;s you, ma'am!' and how did my heart, which was in my mouth, &s;ink, what was my de|ba&s;ement of &s;oul, when pu&s;hed away with&mdash;'I

do not want you, pert thing!' Another day, when a new gown had excited the highe&s;t good hu|mour, and &s;he uttered the appropriate <HI>dear,</HI> ad|dre&s;&s;ed unexpectedly to me, I thought I could never do enough to plea&s;e her; I was all alacrity, and ro&s;e proportionably in my own e&s;timation,</P>
<P>"As her daughter grew up, &s;he was pampered with cakes and fruit, while I was, literally &s;peak|ing, fed with the refu&s;e of the table, with her leavings. A liquori&s;h tooth, is, I believe, com|mon to children, and I u&s;ed to &s;teal any thing &s;weet, that I could catch up with a chance of con|cealment. When detected, &s;he was not content to cha&s;ti&s;e me her&s;elf at the moment, but, on my father's return in the evening (he was a &s;hop|man), the principal di&s;cour&s;e was to recount my faults, and attribute them to the wicked di&s;po&s;i|tion which I had brought into the world with me, inherited from my mother. He did not fail to leave the marks of his re&s;entment on my body, and then &s;olaced him&s;elf by playing with my &s;i&s;ter.&mdash;I could have murdered her at tho&s;e mo|ments. To &s;ave my&s;elf from the&s;e unmerciful corrections, I re&s;orted to fal&s;hood, and the un|truths which I &s;turdily maintained, were brought in judgment again&s;t me, to &s;upport my tyrant's inhuman charge of my natural propen&s;ity to vice.
<PB N="67" REF="035555_0065_10056138DBFB0660">
Seeing me treated with contempt, and always be|ing fed and dre&s;&s;ed better, my &s;i&s;ter conceived a contemptuous opinion of me, that proved an ob|&s;tacle to all affection; and my father, hearing continually of my faults, began to con&s;ider me as a cur&s;e entailed on him for his &s;ins: he was there|fore ea&s;ily prevailed on to bind me apprentice to one of my &s;tep-mother's friends, who kept a &s;lop|&s;hop in Wapping. I was repre&s;ented (as it was &s;aid) in my true colours; but &s;he, 'warranted,' &s;napping her fingers, 'that &s;he &s;hould break my &s;pirit or heart.'</P>
<P>"My mother replied, with a whine, 'that if any body could make me better, it was &s;uch a clever woman as her&s;elf; though, for her own part, &s;he had tried in vain; but goodnature was her fault.'</P>
<P>"I &s;hudder with horror, when I recollect the treatment I had now to endure. Not only under the la&s;h of my ta&s;k mi&s;tre&s;s, but the drudge of the maid, apprentices and children, I never had a ta&s;te of human kindne&s;s to &s;often the rigour of perpetual labour. I had been introduced as an object of abhorrence into the family; as a crea|ture of whom my &s;tep-mother, though &s;he had been kind enough to let me live in the hou&s;e with
<PB N="68" REF="035555_0066_1005613B0737A800">
her own child, could make nothing. I was de&s;|cribed as a wretch, who&s;e no&s;e mu&s;t be kept to the grinding &s;tone&mdash;and it was held there with an iron gra&s;p. It &s;eemed indeed the privilege of their &s;uperior nature to kick me about like the dog or cat. If I were attentive, I was called fawning, if refractory, an ob&s;tinate mule, and like a mule I received their cen&s;ure on my loaded back. Often has my mi&s;tre&s;s, for &s;ome in&s;tance of for|getfulne&s;s, thrown me from one &s;ide of the kit|chen to the other, knocking my head again&s;t the wall, &s;pit in my face, with various refinements on barbarity that I forbear to enumerate, though they were all acted over again by the &s;ervant, with ad|ditional in&s;ults, to which the appellation of <HI>ba&s;tard,</HI> was commonly added, with taunts or &s;neers. But I will not attempt to give you an adequate idea of my &s;ituation, le&s;t you, who probably have never been drenched with the dregs of human mi&s;ery, &s;hould think I exaggerate.</P>
<P>"I &s;tole now, from ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity,&mdash;bread; yet whatever el&s;e was taken, which I had it not in my power to take, was a&s;cribed to me. I was the filching cat, the ravenous dog, the dumb brute, who mu&s;t bear all; for if I endeavoured to exculpate my&s;elf, I was &s;ilenced, without any enquiries being made, with 'hold your tongue,
<PB N="69" REF="035555_0067_1005613D1F6932E0">
you never tell truth.' Even the very air I breathed was tainted with &s;corn; for I was &s;ent to the neighbouring &s;hops with glutton, liar, or thief, written on my forehead. This was, at fir&s;t, the mo&s;t bitter puni&s;hment; but &s;ullen pride, or a kind of &s;tupid de&s;peration, made me, at length, almo&s;t regardle&s;s of the contempt, which had wrung from me &s;o many &s;olitary tears at the only moments when I was allowed to re&s;t.</P>
<P>"Thus was I the mark of cruelty till my &s;ix|teenth year; and then I have only to point out a change of mi&s;ery; for a period I never knew. Allow me fir&s;t to make one ob&s;ervation. Now I look back, I cannot help attributing the greater part of my mi&s;ery, to the misfortune of having been thrown into the world without the grand &s;upport of life&mdash;a mother's affection. I had no one to love me; or to make me re&s;pected to ena|ble me to acquire re&s;pect. I was an egg dropped on the &s;and; a pauper by nature, hunted from family to family, who belonged to nobody&mdash;and nobody cared for me. I was de&s;pi&s;ed from my birth, and denied the chance of obtaining a foot|ing for my&s;elf in &s;ociety. Yes; I had not even the chance of being con&s;idered as a fellow-crea|ture&mdash;yet all the people with whom I lived, bru|talized as they were by the low cunning of trade,

and the de&s;picable &s;hifts of poverty, were not without bowels, though they never yearned for me. I was, in fact, born a &s;lave, and chained by infamy to &s;lavery during the whole of exi&s;tence, without having any companions to alleviate it by &s;ympathy, or teach me how to ri&s;e above it by their example. But, to re&s;ume the thread of my tale&mdash;</P>
<P>"At &s;ixteen, I &s;uddenly grew tall, and &s;ome|thing like comeline&s;s appeared on a Sunday, when I had time to wa&s;h my face, and put on clean clothes. My ma&s;ter had once or twice caught hold of me in the pa&s;&s;age; but I in&s;tinc|tively avoided his di&s;gu&s;ting care&s;&s;es. One day, however, when the family were at a methodi&s;t meeting, he contrived to be alone in the hou&s;e with me, and by blows&mdash;yes, blows and menaces, compelled me to &s;ubmit to his ferocious de&s;ire; and, to avoid my mi&s;tre&s;s's fury, I was obliged in future to comply, and to &s;kulk to my loft at his command, in &s;pite of increa&s;ing loathing.</P>
<P>"The angui&s;h which was now pent up in my bo&s;om, &s;eemed to open a new world to me: I began to extend my thoughts beyond my&s;elf, and grieve for human mi&s;ery, till I di&s;covered with horror&mdash;ah! what horror! that I was with child.
<PB N="71" REF="035555_0069_100561415E43B9F8">
I knew not why I felt a mixed &s;en&s;ation of de&s;pair and tenderne&s;s, excepting that, ever called a ba&s;|tard, a ba&s;tard appeared to me an object of the greate&s;t compa&s;&s;ion in creation.</P>
<P>"I communicated this dreadful circum&s;tance to my ma&s;ter, who was almo&s;t equally alarmed at the intelligence; for he feared his wife, and public cen&s;ure at the meeting. After &s;ome weeks of deliberation had elap&s;ed, I in continual fear that my altered &s;hape would be noticed, my ma&s;ter gave me a medicine in a phial, which he de&s;ired me to take, telling me, without any cir|cumlocution, for what purpo&s;e it was de&s;igned. I bur&s;t into tears, I thought it was killing my&s;elf, yet was &s;uch a &s;elf as I worth pre&s;erving? He cur&s;ed me for a fool, and left me to my own re|flections. I could not re&s;olve to take this infernal potion; but I wrapt it up in an old gown, and hid it in a corner of my box.</P>
<P>"Nobody yet &s;u&s;pected me, becau&s;e they had been accu&s;tomed to view me as a creature of an|other &s;pecies. But the threatening &s;torm at la&s;t broke over my devoted head&mdash;never &s;hall I forget it!

brutal appetite. His extreme intoxication made him forget his cu&s;tomary caution, and my mi&s;tre&s;s entered and found us in a &s;ituation that could not have been more hateful to her than me. Her hu&s;|band was 'pot valiant,' he feared her not at the moment, nor had he then much rea&s;on, for &s;he in&s;tantly turned the whole force of her anger an|other way. She tore off my cap, &s;cratched, kicked, and buffetted me, till &s;he had exau&s;ted her &s;trength, declaring, as &s;he re&s;ted her arm, 'that I had wheedled her hu&s;band from her. But could any thing better be expected from a wretch, whom &s;he had taken into her hou&s;e out of pure charity?' What a torrent of abu&s;e ru&s;hed out? till, almo&s;t breathle&s;s, &s;he concluded with &s;aying&mdash;' that I was born a &s;trumpet; it ran in my blood, and nothing good could come to tho&s;e who harboured me.'</P>
<P>My &s;ituation was, of cour&s;e, di&s;covered, and &s;he declared that I &s;hould not &s;tay another night under the &s;ame roof with an hone&s;t family.

Whither would I creep for &s;helter? To my father's roof I had no claim, when not pur|&s;ued by &s;hame;&mdash;now I &s;hrunk back as from death, from my mother's cruel reproaches, my father's execrations. I could not endure to hear him cur&s;e the day I was born, though life had been a cur&s;e to me. Of death I thought, but with a confu&s;ed emotion of terror, as I &s;tood leaning my head on a po&s;t, and &s;tarting at every foot&s;tep, le&s;t it &s;hould be my mi&s;tre&s;s coming to tear my heart out. One of the boys of the &s;hop pa&s;&s;ing by, heard my tale, and immediately repaired to his ma&s;ter, to give him a de&s;cription of my &s;itua|tion; and he touched the right key&mdash;the &s;candal it would give ri&s;e to, if I were left to repeat my tale to every enquirer. This plea came home to his rea&s;on, who had been &s;obered by his wife's rage, the fury of which fell upon him when I was out of her reach, and he &s;ent the boy to me with half-a-guinea, de&s;iring him to conduct me to a hou&s;e, where beggars, and other wretches, the refu&s;e of &s;ociety, nightly lodged.</P>

<P>"But, to pa&s;s over a &s;ubject which I recollect with pain, I mu&s;t remark to you, as an an&s;wer to your often repeated que&s;tion, 'Why my &s;enti|ments and language were &s;uperior to my &s;tation?' that I now began to read, to beguile the tediou&s;ne&s;s of &s;olitude, and to gratify an inqui&s;itive, active mind. I had often in my childhood, followed a ballad-&s;inger, to hear the &s;equel of a di&s;mal &s;tory, though &s;ure of being &s;everely puni&s;hed for delaying to return with whatever I was &s;ent to purcha&s;e. I could ju&s;t &s;pell and put a &s;entence together, and I li&s;tened to the various arguments, though often mingled with ob&s;cenity, which occurred at the table where I was allowed to pre&s;ide: for a lite|rary friend or two frequently came home with my ma&s;ter, to dine and pa&s;s the night. Having lo&s;t the privileged re&s;pect of my &s;ex, my pre&s;ence, in&s;tead of re&s;training, perhaps gave the reins to their tongues; &s;till I had the advantage of hearing di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, from which, in the common cour&s;e of life, women are excluded.</P>

what might be termed a moral &s;en&s;e. But my fondne&s;s of reading increa&s;ing, and my ma&s;ter occa&s;ionally &s;hutting him&s;elf up in this retreat, for weeks together, to write, I had many oppor|tunities of improvement.

The aim of his writings was to touch the &s;imple &s;trings of the heart; for he de&s;pi&s;ed the would-be oracles, the &s;elf-elected philo&s;ophers, who fright away fancy, while &s;ifting each grain of thought to prove that &s;lowne&s;s of comprehen&s;ion is wi&s;dom.</P>

And, indeed, I &s;oon did recollect it as &s;uch with agony, when his &s;udden death (for he had recour&s;e to the mo&s;t exhilirating cordials to keep up the convivial tone of his &s;pirits) again threw me into the de&s;ert of human &s;ociety. Had he had any time for reflection, I am certain he would have left the little property in his power to me: but, attacked by the fatal apoplexy in town, his heir, a man of rigid morals, brought his wife with him to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e and ef|fects, before I was even informed of his death,&mdash;'to prevent,' as &s;he took care indirectly to tell me, '&s;uch a creature as &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed me to be, from purloining any of them, had I been apprized of the event in time.'</P>

Be&s;ides, I fore&s;aw, to aggravate the &s;everity of my fate, that my little pittance would &s;oon melt away.

Not that I di&s;liked employment, but the inequa|lity of condition to which I mu&s;t have &s;ubmitted.

<P>"One of the gentlemen, whom I had fre|quently dined in company with, while I was treated like a companion, met me in the &s;treet, and enquired after my health.

"In reply, I received a long e&s;&s;ay on the energy of the human mind, with continual allu|&s;ions to his own force of character. He added, 'That the woman who could write &s;uch a letter as I had &s;ent him, could never be in want of re|&s;ources, were &s;he to look into her&s;elf, and exert her powers; mi&s;ery was the con&s;equence of in|dolence, and as to my being &s;hut out from &s;o|ciety, it was the lot of man to &s;ubmit to certain privations.'</P>
<P>"How often have I heard," &s;aid Jemima, interrupting her narrative, "in conver&s;ation, and read in books, that every per&s;on willing to work may find employment? It is the vague a&s;&s;ertion, I believe, of in&s;en&s;ible indolence, when it relates to men; but, when with re&s;pect to women, I am &s;ure of its fallacy, unle&s;s they will &s;ubmit to the mo&s;t menial bodily labour; and even to be em|ployed at hard labour is out of the reach of many, who&s;e reputation misfortune or folly has tainted.</P>
<P>"How writers, profe&s;&s;ing to be friends to freedom, and the improvement of morals, can a&s;&s;ert that poverty is no evil, I cannot imagine."</P>
<P>"No more can I," interrupted Maria; "yet they even expatiate on the peculiar happine&s;s of

indigence, though in what it can con&s;i&s;t, except|ing in brutal re&s;t, when a man can barely earn a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, I cannot imagine. The mind is ne|ce&s;&s;arily impri&s;oned in its own little tenement; and, fully occupied by keeping it in repair, has not time to rove abroad for improvement. The book of knowledge is clo&s;ely cla&s;ped, again&s;t tho&s;e who mu&s;t fulfil their daily ta&s;k of &s;evere manual labour or die; and curio&s;ity, rarely excited by thought or information, &s;eldom moves on the &s;tagnate lake of ignorance."</P>
<P>"As far as I have been able to ob&s;erve," re|plied Jemima, "prejudices caught up by chance, are ob&s;tinately maintained by the poor, to the exclu&s;ion of improvement; they have not time to rea&s;on or reflect to any extent, or minds &s;uffici|ently exerci&s;ed to adopt the principles of action, which form perhaps the only ba&s;is of contentment in every &s;tation."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The copy which appears to have received the author's la&s;t corrections, ends at this place.</HI></NOTE></P>

<PB N="85" REF="035555_0083_100561610EEF16F0">
of de&s;pi&s;ing their per&s;ecutors. If the poor are happy, or can be happy, things are very well as they are. And I cannot conceive on what prin|ciple tho&s;e writers contend for a change of &s;y&s;tem, who &s;upport this opinion.&mdash;The authors on the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion are much more con|&s;i&s;tent, who grant the fact; yet, in&s;i&s;ting that it is the lot of the majority to be oppre&s;&s;ed in this life, kindly turn them over to another, to rectify the fal&s;e weights and mea&s;ures of this, as the only way to ju&s;tify the di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence. "I have not," continued Darnford, "an opi|nion more fixed by ob&s;ervation in my mind, than that, though riches may fail to promote propor|tionate happine&s;s, poverty mo&s;t commonly ex|cludes it, by &s;hutting up all the avenues to im|provement."</P>
<P>"And as for the affections," added Maria, with a &s;igh, "how gro&s;s, and even tormenting do they become, unle&s;s regulated by an improv|ing mind! The culture of the heart, ever, I be|lieve, keeps pace with that of the mind.&mdash;But pray go on," addre&s;&s;ing Jemima, "though your narrative gives ri&s;e to the mo&s;t painful reflections on the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ociety."</P>
<P>"Not to trouble you," continued &s;he, "with
<PB N="86" REF="035555_0084_1005616407D77DF8">
a detailed de&s;cription of all the painful feelings of unavailing exertion, I have only to tell you, that at la&s;t I got recommended to wa&s;h in a few fami|lies, who did me the favour to admit me into their hou&s;es, without the mo&s;t &s;trict enquiry, to wa&s;h from one in the morning till eight at right, for eighteen or twenty-pence a day. On the hap|pine&s;s to be enjoyed over a wa&s;hing-tub I need not comment; yet you will allow me to ob&s;erve, that this was a wretchedne&s;s of &s;ituation peculiar to my &s;ex. A man with half my indu&s;try, and, I may &s;ay, abilities, could have procured a decent livelihood, and di&s;charged &s;ome of the duties which knit mankind together; whil&s;t I, who had acquired a ta&s;te for the rational, nay, in hone&s;t pride let me a&s;&s;ert it, the virtuous enjoyments of life, was ca&s;t a&s;ide as the filth of &s;ociety. Con|demned to labour, like a machine, only to earn bread, and &s;carcely that, I became melancholy and de&s;perate.</P>
<P>"I have now to mention a circum&s;tance which fills me with remor&s;e, and fear it will entirely de|prive me of your e&s;teem. A trade&s;man became attached to me, and vi&s;ited me frequently,&mdash;and I at la&s;t obtained &s;uch a power over him, that he offered to take me home to his hou&s;e. Con&s;ider, dear madam, I was fami&s;hing: wonder not that
<PB N="87" REF="035555_0085_100561658D405198">
I became a wolf!&mdash;The only rea&s;on for not taking me home immediately, was the having a girl in the hou&s;e, with child by him&mdash;and this girl&mdash;I advi&s;ed him&mdash;yes, I did! would I could forget it!&mdash;to turn out of doors: and one night he de|termined to follow my advice.&mdash;Poor wretch! &s;he fell upon her knees, reminded him that he had promi&s;ed to marry her, that her parents were ho|ne&s;t!&mdash;What did it avail?&mdash;She was turned out.</P>
<P>"She approached her father's door, in the &s;kirts of London,&mdash;li&s;tened at the &s;hutters&mdash;but could not knock.

<P>"She left it, and approaching a tub where hor&s;es were watered, &s;he &s;at down in it, and, with de&s;perate re&s;olution, remained in that atti|tude&mdash;till re&s;olution was no longer nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>"I happened that morning to be going out to wa&s;h, anticipating the moment when I &s;hould e&s;cape from &s;uch hard labour. I pa&s;&s;ed by, ju&s;t as &s;ome men, who were going to work, drew out the &s;tiff, cold corp&s;e.&mdash;Let me not recal the hor|rid moment!&mdash;I recogni&s;ed her pale vi&s;age; I

li&s;tened to the tale told by the &s;pectators, and my heart did not bur&s;t. I thought of my own &s;tate, and wondered how I could be &s;uch a mon&s;ter!&mdash;I worked hard; and returning home, I was attacked by a fever. I &s;uffered both in body and mind. I determined not to live with the wretch. But he did not try me; he left the neighbourhood. I once more returned to the wa&s;h-tub.</P>
<P>"Still this fate, mi&s;erable as it was, admitted of aggravation. Lifting one day a heavy load, a tub fell again&s;t my &s;hin, and gave me great pain. I did not pay much attention to the hurt, till it became a &s;erious wound; being obliged to work as u&s;ual or &s;tarve. But, finding my&s;elf at length unable to &s;tand for any time, I thought of getting into an ho&s;pital.&mdash;Ho&s;pitals, it &s;hould &s;eem (for they are comfortle&s;s abodes for the &s;ick) were ex|pre&s;sly endowed for the reception of the friendle&s;s; yet I, who had on that plea a right to a&s;&s;i&s;tance, wanted the recommendation of the rich and re&s;|pectable, and was &s;everal weeks langui&s;hing for admittance; fees were demanded on entering; and, what was &s;till more unrea&s;onable, &s;ecurity for burying me, that expen&s;e not coming into the letter of the charity. A guinea was the &s;tipulated &s;um&mdash;I could as &s;oon have rai&s;ed a million: and I

was afraid to apply to the pari&s;h for an order, le&s;t they &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed me, I knew not whither. The poor woman at who&s;e hou&s;e I lodged, com|pa&s;&s;ionating my &s;tate, got me into the ho&s;pital; and the family where I received the hurt, &s;ent me five &s;hillings, three and &s;ix-pence of which I gave at my admittance&mdash;I know not for what.</P>
<P>"My leg grew quickly better; but I was di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed before my cure was completed, becau&s;e I could not afford to have my linen wa&s;hed to ap|pear decently, as the virago of a nur&s;e &s;aid, when the gentlemen (the &s;urgeons) came. I cannot give you an adequate idea of the wretchedne&s;s of an ho&s;pital; every thing is left to the care of people intent on gain. The attendants &s;eemed to have lo&s;t all feeling of compa&s;&s;ion in the bu&s;tling di&s;|charge of their offices; death is &s;o familiar to them, that they are not anxious to ward it off. Every thing appeared to be conducted for the ac|commodation of the medical men and their pupils, who came to make experiments on the poor, for the benefit of the rich. One of the phy&s;icians, I mu&s;t not forget to mention, gave me half-a-crown, and ordered me &s;ome wine, when I was at the lowe&s;t ebb. I thought of making my ca&s;e known to the lady-like matron; but her forbidding coun|tenance prevented me. She conde&s;cended to look
<PB N="90" REF="035555_0088_1005623DCD626C10">
on the patients, and make general enquiries, two or three times a week; but the nur&s;es knew the hour when the vi&s;it of ceremony would commence, and every thing was as it &s;hould be.</P>
<P>"After my di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, I was more at a lo&s;s than ever for a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and not to weary you with a repetition of the &s;ame unavailing attempts, unable to &s;tand at the wa&s;hing-tub, I began to con&s;ider the rich and the poor as natural enemies, and became a thief from principle.&mdash;I could not now cea&s;e to rea&s;on, but I hated mankind. I de&s;pi&s;ed my&s;elf, yet I ju&s;tified my conduct. I was taken, tried, and condemned to &s;ix months' im|pri&s;onment in a hou&s;e of correction. My &s;oul recoils with horror from the remembrance of the in&s;ults I had to endure, till branded with &s;hame, I was turned loo&s;e in the &s;treet, pennyle&s;s. I wandered from &s;treet to &s;treet, till, exhau&s;ted by hunger and fatigue, I &s;unk down &s;en&s;ele&s;s at a door, where I had vainly demanded a mor&s;el of bread. I was &s;ent by the inhabitant to the work|hou&s;e, to which he had &s;urlily bid me go, &s;aying, 'he paid enough in con&s;cience to the poor,' when, with parched tongue, I implored his charity. If tho&s;e well-meaning people, who exclaim again&s;t beggars, were acquainted with the treatment the poor receive in many of the&s;e wretched a&s;ylums,
<PB N="91" REF="035555_0089_100556588DCF1090">
they would not &s;tifle &s;o ea&s;ily involuntary &s;ympa|thy, by &s;aying that they have all pari&s;hes to go to, or wonder that the poor dread to enter the gloomy walls. What are the common run of work-hou&s;es, but pri&s;ons, in which many re&s;pectable old peo|ple, worn out by immoderate labour, &s;ink into the grave in &s;orrow, to which they are carried like dogs!"</P>
<P>Alarmed by &s;ome indi&s;tinct noi&s;e, Jemima ro&s;e ha&s;tily to li&s;ten, and Maria, turning to Darn|ford, &s;aid, "I have indeed been &s;hocked beyond expre&s;&s;ion when I have met a pauper's funeral. A coffin carried on the &s;houlders of three or four ill-looking wretches, whom the imagination might ea&s;ily convert into a band of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins ha&s;tening to conceal the corp&s;e, and quarreling about the prey on their way. I know it is of little con&s;equence how we are con&s;igned to the earth; but I am led by this brutal in&s;en&s;ibility, to what even the ani|mal creation appears forcibly to feel, to advert to the wretched, de&s;erted manner in which they died."</P>
<P>"True," rejoined Darnford, "and, till the rich will give more than a part of their wealth, till they will give time and attention to the wants of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, never let them boa&s;t of charity.

Let them open their hearts and not their pur&s;es, and employ their minds in the &s;ervice, if they are really actuated by humanity; or charitable in&s;titutions will always be the prey of the lowe&s;t order of knaves."</P>
<P>Jemima returning, &s;eemed in ha&s;te to fini&s;h her tale. "The over&s;eer farmed the poor of dif|ferent pari&s;hes, and out of the bowels of poverty was wrung the money with which he purcha&s;ed this dwelling, as a private receptacle for madne&s;s. He had been a keeper at a hou&s;e of the &s;ame de|&s;cription, and conceived that he could make mo|ney much more readily in his old occupation. He is a &s;hrewd&mdash;&s;hall I &s;ay it?&mdash;villain. He ob|&s;erved &s;omething re&s;olute in my manner, and of|fered to take me with him, and in&s;truct me how to treat the di&s;turbed minds he meant to intru&s;t to my care. The offer of forty pounds a year, and to quit a work-hou&s;e, was not to be de&s;pi&s;ed, though the condition of &s;hutting my eyes and har|dening my heart was annexed to it.</P>
<P>"I agreed to accompany him; and, four years have I been attendant on many wretches, and"&mdash;&s;he lowered her voice,&mdash;"the witne&s;s of many enormities. In &s;olitude my mind &s;eemed to re|cover its force, and many of the &s;entiments which

<P>Maria took her hand, and Jemima, more over|come by kindne&s;s than &s;he had ever been by cru|elty, ha&s;tened out of the room to conceal her emotions.</P>
<P>Darnford &s;oon after heard his &s;ummons, and, taking leave of him, Maria promi&s;ed to gratify his curio&s;ity, with re&s;pect to her&s;elf, the fir&s;t op|portunity.</P>

<P>ACTIVE as love was in the heart of Maria, the &s;tory &s;he had ju&s;t heard made her thoughts take a wider range. The opening buds of hope clo&s;ed, as if they had put forth too early, and the happie&s;t day of her life was overca&s;t by the mo&s;t melancholy reflections. Thinking of Je|mima's peculiar fate and her own, &s;he was led to con&s;ider the oppre&s;&s;ed &s;tate of women, and to la|ment that &s;he had given birth to a daughter. Sleep fled from her eye-lids, while &s;he dwelt on the wretchedne&s;s of unprotected infancy, till &s;ympathy with Jemima changed to agony, when it &s;eemed probable that her own babe might even now be in the very &s;tate &s;he &s;o forcibly de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Maria thought, and thought again. Jemima's humanity had rather been benumbed than killed, by the keen fro&s;t &s;he had to brave at her entrance into life; an appeal then to her feelings, on this tender point, &s;urely would not be fruitle&s;s; and Maria began to anticipate the delight it would

afford her to gain intelligence of her child. This project was now the only &s;ubject of reflection; and &s;he watched impatiently for the dawn of day, with that determinate purpo&s;e which generally in&s;ures &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>At the u&s;ual hour, Jemima brought her break|fa&s;t, and a tender note from Darnford.&mdash;She ran her eye ha&s;tily over it, and her heart calmly hoarded up the rapture a fre&s;h a&s;&s;urance of affec|tion, affection &s;uch as &s;he wi&s;hed to in&s;pire her, gave her, without diverting her mind a moment from its de&s;ign. While Jemima waited to take away the breakfa&s;t, Maria alluded to the re|flections, that had haunted her during the night, to the exclu&s;ion of &s;leep. She &s;poke with energy of Jemima's unremitted &s;ufferings, and of the fate of a number of de&s;erted females, placed within the &s;weep of a whirlwind, from which it was next to impo&s;&s;ible to e&s;cape. Perceiving the effect her conver&s;ation produced on the counte|nance of her guard, &s;he gra&s;ped the arm of Je|mima with that irre&s;i&s;tible warmth which defies repul&s;e, exclaiming&mdash;"With your heart, and &s;uch dreadful experience, can you lend your aid to deprive my babe of a mother's tenderne&s;s, a mother's care? In the name of God, a&s;&s;i&s;t me to &s;natch her from de&s;truction! let me but prepare

her mind and body to encounter the ills which await her &s;ex, and I will con&s;ider you as her &s;e|cond mother, and her&s;elf as the prop of your age. Yes, Jemima, look at me ob&s;erve me clo&s;ely, and read my very &s;oul; you merit a better fate." &s;he held out her hand with a firm ge&s;ture of a&s;|&s;urance; "and I will procure it for you as a te&s;|timony of my e&s;teem, as well as of my gratitude."</P>
<P>Jemima had not power to re&s;i&s;t this per&s;ua&s;ive torrent; and, owning that the hou&s;e in which &s;he was confined, was &s;ituated on the banks of the Thames, only a few miles from London, and not on the &s;ea-coa&s;t, as Darnford had &s;uppo&s;ed, &s;he promi&s;ed to invent &s;ome excu&s;e for her ab|&s;ence, and go her&s;elf to trace the &s;ituation, and enquire concerning the health, of this abandoned daughter. Her manner implied an intention to do &s;omething more, but &s;he &s;eemed unwilling to impart her de&s;ign; and Maria, glad to have ob|tained the main point, thought it be&s;t to leave her to the workings of her own mind, convinced that &s;he had the power of intere&s;ting her &s;till more in favour of her&s;elf and child, by a &s;imple recital of facts.</P>
<P>In the evening, Jemima informed the impatient mother, that on the morrow &s;he &s;hould ha&s;ten to

town before the family hour of ri&s;ing, and re|ceived all the information nece&s;&s;ary, as a clue to her &s;earch. The "Good night!" Maria uttered was peculiarly &s;olemn and affectionate. Glad expectation &s;parkled in her eye; and, for the fir&s;t time &s;ince her detention, &s;he pronounced the name of her child with plea&s;urable fondne&s;s; and, with all the garrulity of a nur&s;e, de&s;cribed her fir&s;t &s;mile when &s;he recognized her mother. Recollecting her&s;elf, a &s;till kinder "Adieu!" with a "God ble&s;s you!"&mdash;that &s;eemed to include a maternal benediction, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Jemima.</P>
<P>The dreary &s;olitude of the en&s;uing day, length|ened by impatiently dwelling on the &s;ame idea, was intolerably weari&s;ome. She li&s;tened for the &s;ound of a particular clock, which &s;ome directions of the wind allowed her to hear di&s;tinctly. She marked the &s;hadow gaining on the wall; and, twilight thickening into darkne&s;s, her breath &s;eemed oppre&s;&s;ed, while &s;he anxiou&s;ly counted nine.&mdash;The la&s;t &s;ound was a &s;troke of de&s;pair on her heart; for &s;he expected every moment, with|out &s;eeing Jemima, to have her light extingui&s;hed by the &s;avage female who &s;upplied her place. She was even obliged to prepare for bed, re&s;tle&s;s as &s;he was, not to di&s;oblige her new attendant. She had been cautioned not to &s;peak too freely to her

but the caution was needle&s;s, her countenance would &s;till more emphatically have made her &s;hrink back. Such was the ferocity of manner, con&s;picuous in every word and ge&s;ture of this hag, that Maria was afraid to enquire, why Jemima, who had faithfully promi&s;ed to &s;ee her before her door was &s;hut for the night, came not?&mdash;and, when the key turned in the lock, to con&s;ign her to a night of &s;u&s;pen&s;e, &s;he felt a degree of angui&s;h which the circum&s;tances &s;carcely ju&s;tified.</P>
<P>Continually on the watch, the &s;hutting of a door, or the &s;ound of a foot&s;tep, made her &s;tart and tremble with apprehen&s;ion, &s;omething like what &s;he felt, when, at her entrance, dragged along the gallery, &s;he began to doubt whether &s;he were not &s;urrounded by demons?</P>
<P>Fatigued by an endle&s;s rotation of thought and wild alarms, &s;he looked like a &s;pectre, when Jemima entered in the morning; e&s;pecially as her eyes darted out of her head, to read in Jemi|ma's countenance, almo&s;t as pallid, the intelli|gence &s;he dared not tru&s;t her tongue to demand. Jemima put down the tea things, and appeared very bu&s;y in arranging the table.

which agitated the mu&s;cles of her mouth, &s;he &s;aid, "Spare your&s;elf the pain of preparing me for your information, I conjure you!&mdash;My child is dead!" Jemima &s;olemnly an&s;wered, "Yes;" with a look expre&s;&s;ive of compa&s;&s;ion and angry emotions. "Leave me," added Ma|ria, making a fre&s;h effort to govern her feelings, and hiding her face in her handkerchief, to con|ceal her angui&s;h&mdash;"It is enough&mdash;I know that my babe is no more&mdash;I will hear the particulars when I am"&mdash;calmer, &s;he could not utter; and Jemima, without importuning her by idle at|tempts to con&s;ole her, left the room.</P>
<P>Plunged in the deepe&s;t melancholy, &s;he would not admit Darnford's vi&s;its; and &s;uch is the force of early a&s;&s;ociations, even on &s;trong minds, that, for a while, &s;he indulged the &s;uper&s;titious notion that &s;he was ju&s;tly puni&s;hed by the death of her child for having an in&s;tant cea&s;ed to regret her lo&s;s. Two or three letters from Darnford, full of &s;ooth|ing, manly tenderne&s;s, only added poignancy to the&s;e accu&s;ing emotions; yet the pa&s;&s;ionate &s;tile in which he expre&s;&s;ed, what he termed the fir&s;t and fonde&s;t wi&s;h of his heart, "that his affection might make her &s;ome amends for the cruelty and inju&s;tice &s;he had endured," in&s;pired a &s;entiment of gratitude to heaven; and her eyes filled with

delicious tears, when, at the conclu&s;ion of his letter, wi&s;hing to &s;upply the place of her unworthy relations, who&s;e want of principle he execrated, he a&s;&s;ured her, calling her his deare&s;t girl, "that it &s;hould henceforth be the bu&s;ine&s;s of his life to make her happy."</P>
<P>He begged, in a note &s;ent the following morn|ing, to be permitted to &s;ee her, when his pre&s;ence would be no intru&s;ion on her grief; and &s;o ear|ne&s;tly intreated to be allowed, according to pro|mi&s;e, to beguile the tedious moments of ab&s;ence, by dwelling on the events of her pa&s;t life, that &s;he &s;ent him the memoirs which had been written for her daughter, promi&s;ing Jemima the peru&s;al as &s;oon as he returned them.</P>

<P>"ADDRESSING the&s;e memoirs to you, my child, uncertain whether I &s;hall ever have an op|portunity of in&s;tructing you, many ob&s;ervations will probably flow from my heart, which only a mother&mdash;a mother &s;chooled in mi&s;ery, could make.</P>
<P>"The tenderne&s;s of a father who knew the world, might be great; but could it equal that of a mother&mdash;of a mother, labouring under a portion of the mi&s;ery, which the con&s;titution of &s;ociety &s;eems to have entailed on all her kind? It is, my child, my deare&s;t daughter, only &s;uch a mother, who will dare to break through all re&s;traint to provide for your happine&s;s&mdash;who will voluntarily brave cen&s;ure her&s;elf, to ward off &s;or|row from your bo&s;om. From my narrative, my dear girl, you may gather the in&s;truction, the coun&s;el, which is meant rather to exerci&s;e than influence your mind. Death may &s;natch me from you, before you can weigh my advice, or enter into my rea&s;oning: I would then, with fond

What is wi&s;dom, too often, but the owl of the godde&s;s, who &s;its moping in a de&s;olated heart; around me &s;he &s;hrieks, but I would invite all the gay warblers of &s;pring to ne&s;tle in your blooming bo&s;om.&mdash;Had I not wa&s;ted years in deliberating, after I cea&s;ed to doubt, how I ought to have acted&mdash;I might now be u&s;eful and happy. For my &s;ake, warned by my example, always appear what you are, and you will not pa&s;s through exi&s;tence with|out enjoying its genuine ble&s;&s;ings, love and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>"Born in one of the mo&s;t romantic parts of England, an enthu&s;ia&s;tic fondne&s;s for the varying charms of nature is the fir&s;t &s;entiment I recollect; or rather it was the fir&s;t con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of plea&s;ure that employed and formed my imagination.</P>
<P>"My father had been a captain of a man-of-war; but, di&s;gu&s;ted with the &s;ervice, on account of the preferment of men who&s;e chief merit was

their family connections or borough intere&s;t, he retired into the country; and, not knowing what to do with him&s;elf&mdash;married. In his family, to regain his lo&s;t con&s;equence, he determined to keep up the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ive obedience, as in the ve&s;|&s;els in which he had commanded. His orders were not to be di&s;puted; and the whole hou&s;e was expected to fly, at the word of command, as if to man the &s;hrouds, or mount aloft in an ele|mental &s;trife, big with life or death.&mdash;He was to be in&s;tantaneou&s;ly obeyed, e&s;pecially by my mo|ther, whom he very benevolently married for love; but took care to remind her of the obligation, when &s;he dared, in the &s;lighte&s;t in&s;tance, to que&s;|tion his ab&s;olute authority. My elde&s;t brother, it is true, as he grew up, was treated with more re&s;pect by my father; and became in due form the deputy-tyrant of the hou&s;e. The repre&s;entative of my father, a being privileged by nature&mdash;a boy, and the darling of my mother, he did not fail to act like an heir apparent. Such indeed was my mother's extravagant partiality, that, in compa|ri&s;on with her affection for him, &s;he might be &s;aid not to love the re&s;t of her children.&mdash;Yet none of the children &s;eemed to have &s;o little af|fection for her. Extreme indulgence had ren|dered him &s;o &s;elfi&s;h, that he only thought of him|&s;elf; and from tormenting in&s;ects and animals,
<PB N="104" REF="035555_0102_10056185249BF6A8">
he became the de&s;pot of his brothers, and &s;till more of his &s;i&s;ters.</P>
<P>"It is perhaps difficult to give you an idea of the petty cares which ob&s;cured the morning of my life; continual re&s;traint in the mo&s;t trivial matters; unconditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to orders, which, as a mere child, I &s;oon di&s;covered to be unrea&s;onable, becau&s;e incon&s;i&s;tent and contradic|tory. Thus are we de&s;tined to experience a mix|ture of bitterne&s;s, with the recollection of our mo&s;t innocent enjoyments.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances which, during my child|hood, occurred to fa&s;hion my mind, were various; yet, as it would probably afford me more plea&s;ure to revive the fading remembrance of new-born delight, than you, my child, could feel in the peru&s;al, I will not entice you to &s;tray with me into the verdant meadow, to &s;earch for the flowers that youthful hopes &s;catter in every path; though as I write, I almo&s;t &s;cent the fre&s;h green of &s;pring&mdash;of that &s;pring which never returns!</P>
<P>"I had two &s;i&s;ters, and one brother, younger than my&s;elf; my brother Robert was two years older, and might truly be termed the idol of his parents, and the torment of the re&s;t of the family.

Such indeed is the force of prejudice, that what was called &s;pirit and wit in him, was cruelly re|pre&s;&s;ed as forwardne&s;s in me.</P>
<P>"My mother had an indolence of character, which prevented her from paying much attention to our education. But the healthy breeze of a neighbouring heath, on which we bounded at plea&s;ure, volatilized the humours that improper food might have generated. And to enjoy open air and freedom, was paradi&s;e, after the unna|tural re&s;traint of our fire-&s;ide, where we were of|ten obliged to &s;it three or four hours together, without daring to utter a word, when my father was out of humour, from want of employment, or of a variety of boi&s;terous amu&s;ement. I had however one advantage, an in&s;tructor, the bro|ther of my father, who, intended for the church, had of cour&s;e received a liberal education. But, becoming attached to a young lady of great beauty and large fortune, and acquiring in the world &s;ome opinions not con&s;onant with the profe&s;&s;ion for which he was de&s;igned, he accepted, with the mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations of &s;ucce&s;s, the offer of a nobleman to accompany him to India, as his confidential &s;ecretary.</P>
<P>"A corre&s;pondence was regularly kept up with
<PB N="106" REF="035555_0104_10056188C6652178">
the object of his affection; and the intricacies of bu&s;ine&s;s, peculiarly weari&s;ome to a man of a ro|mantic turn of mind, contributed, with a forced ab&s;ence, to increa&s;e his attachment. Every other pa&s;&s;ion was lo&s;t in this ma&s;ter-one, and only &s;erved to &s;well the torrent. Her relations, &s;uch were his waking dreams, who had de&s;pi&s;ed him, would court in their turn his alliance, and all the blandi&s;h|ments of ta&s;te would grace the triumphs of love.&mdash;While he ba&s;ked in the warm &s;un&s;hine of love, friend&s;hip al&s;o promi&s;ed to &s;hed its dewy fre&s;h|ne&s;s; for a friend, whom he loved next to his mi&s;tre&s;s, was the confident, who forwarded the letters from one to the other, to elude the ob&s;er|vation of prying relations. A friend, fal&s;e in &s;imi|lar circum&s;tances, is, my deare&s;t girl, an old tale; yet, let not this example, or the frigid caution of cold-blooded morali&s;ts, make you endeavour to &s;tifle hopes, which are the buds that naturally un|fold them&s;elves during the &s;pring of life! Whil&s;t your own heart is &s;incere, always expect to meet one glowing with the &s;ame &s;entiments; for to fly from plea&s;ure, is not to avoid pain!</P>
<P>"My uncle realized, by good luck, rather than management, a hand&s;ome fortune; and returning on the wings of love, lo&s;t in the mo&s;t enchanting reveries, to England, to &s;hare it with his mi&s;tre&s;s and his friend, he found them&mdash;united.</P>

"There were &s;ome circum&s;tances, not nece&s;|&s;ary for me to recite, which aggravated the guilt of the friend beyond mea&s;ure, and the deception, which had been carried on to the la&s;t moment, was &s;o ba&s;e, it produced the mo&s;t violent effect on my uncle's health and &s;pirits.&mdash;His native country, the world! lately a garden of blooming &s;weets, bla&s;ted by treachery, &s;eemed changed into a parched de&s;ert, the abode of hi&s;&s;ing &s;erpents. Di&s;appointment rankled in his heart; and, brood|ing over his wrongs, he was attacked by a raging fever, followed by a derangement of mind, which only gave place to habitual melancholy, as he re|covered more &s;trength of body.</P>
<P>"Declaring an intention never to marry, his relations were ever clu&s;tering about him, paying the gro&s;&s;e&s;t adulation to a man, who, di&s;gu&s;ted with mankind, received them with &s;corn, or bit|ter &s;arca&s;ms. Something in my countenance plea&s;ed him, when I began to prattle. Since his return he appeared dead to affection; but I &s;oon, by &s;howing him innocent fondne&s;s, became a favourite; and endeavouring to enlarge and &s;trengthen my mind, I grew dear to him in pro|portion as I imbibed his &s;entiments. He had a forcible manner of &s;peaking, rendered more &s;o by a certain impre&s;&s;ive wildne&s;s of look and ge&s;ture,
<PB N="108" REF="035555_0106_1005618D45CDDAE8">
calculated to engage the attention of a young and ardent mind. It is not then &s;urpri&s;ing that I quickly adopted his opinions in preference, and reverenced him as one of a &s;uperior order of be|ings. He inculcated, with great warmth, &s;elf|re&s;pect, and a lofty con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of acting right, independent of the cen&s;ure or applau&s;e of the world; nay, he almo&s;t taught me to brave, and even de&s;pi&s;e its cen&s;ure, when convinced of the rectitude of my own intentions.</P>
<P>Endeavouring to prove to me that nothing which de&s;erved the name of love or friend&s;hip, exi&s;ted in the world, he drew &s;uch animated pic|tures of his own feelings, rendered permanent by di&s;appointment, as imprinted the &s;entiments &s;trongly on my heart, and animated my imagina|tion. The&s;e remarks are nece&s;&s;ary to elucidate &s;ome peculiarities in my character, which by the world are indefinitely termed romantic.</P>
<P>"My uncle's increa&s;ing affection led him to vi&s;it me often. Still unable to re&s;t in any place, he did not remain long in the country to &s;often dome&s;tic tyranny; but he brought me books, for which I had a pa&s;&s;ion, and they con&s;pired with his conver&s;ation, to make me form an ideal pic|ture of life. I &s;hall pa&s;s over the tyranny of my

father, much as I &s;uffered from it; but it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to notice, that it undermined my mother's health; and that her temper, continually irritated by dome&s;tic bickering, became intolerably peevi&s;h.</P>
<P>"My elde&s;t brother was articled to a neigh|bouring attorney, the &s;hrewde&s;t, and I may add, the mo&s;t unprincipled man in that part of the country. As my brother generally came home every Saturday, to a&s;toni&s;h my mother by exhi|biting his attainments, he gradually a&s;&s;umed a right of directing the whole family, not excepting my father. He &s;eemed to take a peculiar plea&s;ure in tormenting and humbling me; and if ever I ventured to complain of this treatment to either my father or mother, I was rudely rebuffed for pre&s;uming to judge of the conduct of my elde&s;t brother.</P>
<P>"About this period a merchant's family came to &s;ettle in our neighbourhood. A man&s;ion-hou&s;e in the village, lately purcha&s;ed, had been prepar|ing the whole &s;pring, and the &s;ight of the co&s;tly furniture, &s;ent from London, had excited my mother's envy, and rou&s;ed my father's pride. My &s;en&s;ations were very different, and all of a plea&s;urable kind. I longed to &s;ee new characters, to break the tedious monotony of my life; and to
<PB N="110" REF="035555_0108_100561916B33CC98">
find a friend, &s;uch as fancy pourtrayed. I can|not then de&s;cribe the emotion I felt the Sunday they made their appearance at church. My eyes were rivetted on the pillar round which I ex|pected fir&s;t to get a glimp&s;e of them, and darted forth to meet a &s;ervant who ha&s;tily preceded a group of ladies, who&s;e white robes and waving plumes, &s;eemed to &s;tream along the gloomy ai&s;le, diffu&s;ing the light, by which I contemplated their figures.</P>
<P>"We vi&s;ited them in form, and I quickly &s;e|lected the elde&s;t daughter for my friend. The &s;econd &s;on, George, paid me particular attention, and finding his attainments and manners &s;uperior to tho&s;e of the young men of the village, I began to imagine him &s;uperior to the re&s;t of mankind. Had my home been more comfortable, or my previous acquaintance been more numerous, I &s;hould not probably have been &s;o eager to open my heart to new affections.</P>
<P>"Mr. Venables, the merchant, had acquired a large fortune by unremitting attention to bu&s;i|ne&s;s; but his health declining rapidly, he was obliged to retire, before his &s;on, George, had acquired &s;ufficient experience, to enable him to conduct their affairs on the &s;ame prudential plan,
<PB N="111" REF="035555_0109_10056193817EB0C0">
his father had invariably pur&s;ued. Indeed, he had laboured to throw off his authority, having de&s;pi&s;ed his narrow plans and cautious &s;peculati|ons. The elde&s;t &s;on could not be prevailed on to enter the firm; and, to oblige his wife, and have peace in the hou&s;e, mr. Venables had purcha&s;ed a commi&s;&s;ion for him in the guards.</P>
<P>"I am now alluding to circum&s;tances which came to my knowledge long after; but it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary, my deare&s;t child, that you &s;hould know the character of your father, to prevent your de&s;pi&s;ing your mother; the only parent inclined to di&s;charge a parent's duty. In London, George had acquired habits of libertini&s;m, which he care|fully concealed from his father and his commer|cial connections. The ma&s;k he wore, was &s;o complete a covering of his real vi&s;age, that the prai&s;e his father lavi&s;hed on his conduct, and, poor mi&s;taken man! on his principles, contra&s;ted with his brother's, rendered the notice he took of me peculiarly flattering. Without any fixed de&s;ign, as I am now convinced, he continued to &s;ingle me out at the dance, pre&s;s my hand at part|ing, and utter expre&s;&s;ions of unmeaning pa&s;&s;ion, to which I gave a meaning naturally &s;ugge&s;ted by the romantic turn of my thoughts.

In &s;hort, I fancied my&s;elf in love&mdash;in love with the di&s;intere&s;tne&s;s, fortitude, genero&s;ity, dignity, and humanity, with which I had inve&s;ted the hero I dubbed. A cir|cum&s;tance which &s;oon after occurred, rendered all the&s;e virtues palpable. [The incident is per|haps worth relating on other accounts, and there|fore I &s;hall de&s;cribe it di&s;tinctly.]</P>
<P>"I had a great affection for my nur&s;e, old Mary, for whom I u&s;ed often to work, to &s;pare her eyes. Mary had a younger &s;i&s;ter, married to a &s;ailor, while &s;he was &s;uckling me; for my mo|ther only &s;uckled my elde&s;t brother, which might be the cau&s;e of her extraordinary partiality. Peggy, Mary's &s;i&s;ter, lived with her, till her hu&s;|band, becoming a mate in a We&s;t-India trader, got a little before-hand in the world. He wrote to his wife from the fir&s;t port in the channel, after his mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful voyage, to reque&s;t her to come to London to meet him; he even wi&s;hed her to determine on living there for the &s;uture, to &s;ave him the trouble of coming to her the mo|ment he came on &s;hore; and, to turn a penny by keeping a green-&s;tall. It was too much to &s;et out on a journey the moment he had fini&s;hed a voy|age,

and fifty miles by land was wor&s;e than a thou&s;and leagues by &s;ea.</P>
<P>"She packed up her alls, and came to London&mdash;but did not meet hone&s;t Daniel. A common misfortune prevented her&mdash;and the poor are bound to &s;uffer for the good of their country&mdash;he was pre&s;&s;ed in the river&mdash;and never came on &s;hore.</P>
<P>"Peggy was mi&s;erable in London, not know|ing, as &s;he &s;aid, 'the face of any living &s;oul;' be&s;ides her imagination had been employed, an|ticipating a month or &s;ix weeks' happine&s;s with her hu&s;band. Daniel was to have gone with her to Sadler's Wells, and We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey, and to many &s;ights, which he knew &s;he never heard of in the country. Peggy too was thrifty, and how could &s;he manage to put his plan in execution alone? He had acquaintance, but &s;he did not know the very name of their places of abode. His letters were made up of&mdash;How do you does, and God ble&s;s yous&mdash;information was re&s;erved for the hour of meeting.</P>
<P>"She too had her portion of information, near at heart. Molly and Jacky were grown &s;uch little darlings, &s;he was almo&s;t angry that daddy did not &s;ee their little tricks. She had not half

the plea&s;ure &s;he &s;hould have had from their prattle, could &s;he have recounted to him each night the pretty &s;peeches of the day. Some &s;tories, how|ever, were &s;tored up&mdash;and Jacky could &s;ay pappa with &s;uch a &s;weet voice, it mu&s;t delight his heart. Yet when &s;he came, and found no Daniel to greet her, when Jacky called pappa, &s;he wept, &s;aying, 'God ble&s;s his innocent &s;oul, that did not know what &s;orrow was.'&mdash;But more &s;orrow was in &s;tore for Peggy, innocent as &s;he was.&mdash;Daniel was killed in the fir&s;t engagement, and then the <HI>papa</HI> was agony &s;ounding to the heart.</P>
<P>"She had lived &s;paringly on his wages, while there was any hope of his return, but that gone, &s;he returned with a breaking heart to the country, to a little market town, nearly three miles from our village. She did not like to go to &s;ervice, to be &s;nubbed about, after being her own mi&s;tre&s;s. To put her children out to nur&s;e was impo&s;&s;ible: How far would her wages go? and to &s;end them to her hu&s;band's pari&s;h, was to lo&s;e her hu&s;band twice over.</P>
<P>"I had heard all from Mary, and made my uncle furni&s;h a little cottage for her, to enable her to fell&mdash;&s;o &s;acred was poor Daniel's advice, now he was dead and gone&mdash;a little fruit, toys,
<PB N="115" REF="035555_0113_1005619C3190FAE8">
and cakes. The minding of the &s;hop did not re|quire her whole time, nor even the keeping her children clean, and &s;he loved to &s;ee them clean; &s;o &s;he took in wa&s;hing, and altogether made a &s;hift to earn bread for her children, &s;till weeping for Daniel, when Jacky's arch tricks made her think of his father,&mdash;It was plea&s;ant to work for her children. 'Yes; from morning till night, could &s;he have had a ki&s;s from their father, God re&s;t his &s;oul! Yes; had it plea&s;ed Providence to have let him come back without a leg or an arm, it would have been the &s;ame thing to her&mdash;for &s;he did not love him becau&s;e he maintained them&mdash;no: &s;he had hands of her own.'</P>
<P>"The country people were hone&s;t, and Peggy left her linen to dry very late. A recruiting party, as &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, pa&s;&s;ing through, made free with a large wa&s;h; for it was all &s;wept away, including her own and her children's little &s;tock.</P>
<P>"This was a dreadful blow; two dozen of &s;hirts, &s;tocks, and handkerchiefs. She gave the money which &s;he had laid by for half a year's rent, and promi&s;ed to pay two &s;hillings a week till all was cleared; &s;o &s;he did not lo&s;e her employment. This two &s;hillings a week, and the buying a few nece&s;&s;aries for the children, drove her &s;o hard,
<PB N="116" REF="035555_0114_1005619F1D4E7100">
that &s;he had not a penny to pay her rent with, when a twelvemonth's became due.</P>
<P>"She was now with Mary, and had ju&s;t told her tale, which Mary in&s;tantly repeated&mdash;it was intended for my ear. Many hou&s;es in this town, producing a borough intere&s;t, were included in the e&s;tate purcha&s;ed by mr. Venables, and the attorney with whom my brother lived, was ap|pointed his agent, to collect and rai&s;e the rents.</P>
<P>"He demanded Peggy's, and, in &s;pite of her intreaties, her poor goods had been &s;eized and fold. So that &s;he had not, and what was wor&s;e her children, 'for &s;he had known &s;orrow enough,' a bed to lie on. She knew that I was good-na|tured&mdash;right charitable, yet not liking to a&s;k for more than needs mu&s;t, &s;he &s;corned to petition while people could any how be made to wait. But now, &s;hould &s;he be turned out of doors, &s;he mu&s;t expect nothing le&s;s than to lo&s;e all her cu&s;|tomers, and then &s;he mu&s;t beg or &s;tarve&mdash;and what would become of her children?&mdash;'Had Da|niel not been pre&s;&s;ed&mdash;but God knows be&s;t&mdash;all this could not have happened.'</P>
<P>"I had two matra&s;&s;es on my bed; what did I want with two, when &s;uch a worthy creature

mu&s;t lie on the ground? My mother would be angry, but I could conceal it till my uncle came down; and then I would tell him all the whole truth, and if he ab&s;olved me, heaven would.</P>
<P>"I begged the hou&s;e-maid to come up &s;tairs with me (&s;ervants always feel for the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of poverty, and &s;o would the rich if they knew what it was). She a&s;&s;i&s;ted me to tie up the matra&s;s; I di&s;covering, at the &s;ame time, that one blanket would &s;erve me till winter, could I per&s;uade my &s;i&s;ter, who &s;lept with me, to keep my &s;ecret. She entering in the mid&s;t of the package, I gave her &s;ome new feathers to &s;ilence her. We got the matra&s;s down the back &s;tairs, unperceived, and I helped to carry it, taking with me all the money I had, and what I could borrow from my &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>"When I got to the cottage, Peggy declared that &s;he would not take what I had brought &s;e|cretly; but, when with all the eager eloquence in&s;pired by a decided purpo&s;e, I gra&s;ped her hand with weeping eyes, a&s;&s;uring her that my uncle would &s;creen her from blame, when he was once more in the country, de&s;cribing, at the &s;ame time, what &s;he would &s;uffer in parting with her children, after keeping them &s;o long from being thrown on the pari&s;h, &s;he reluctantly con&s;ented.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="035555_0116_100561A2C5D312D8">
"My project of u&s;efulne&s;s ended not here; I determined to &s;peak to the attorney; he fre|quently paid me compliments. His character did not intimidate me; but, imagining that Peggy mu&s;t be mi&s;taken, and that no man could turn a deaf ear to &s;uch a tale of complicated di&s;tre&s;s, I determined to walk to the town with Mary the next morning, and reque&s;t him to wait for the rent, and keep my &s;ecret till my uncle's return.</P>
<P>"My repo&s;e was &s;weet; and, waking with the fir&s;t dawn of day, I bounded to Mary's cot|tage. What charms does not a light heart &s;pread over nature! Every bird that twittered in a bu&s;h, every flower that enlivened the hedge, &s;eemed placed there to awaken me to rapture&mdash;yes; to rapture. The pre&s;ent moment was full fraught with happine&s;s; and on futurity I be&s;towed not a thought, excepting to anticipate my &s;ucce&s;s with the attorney.</P>
<P>"This man of the world, with ro&s;y face and &s;impering features, received me politely, nay kindly; li&s;tened with complacency to my remon|&s;trances, though he &s;carcely heeded Mary's tears. I did not then &s;u&s;pect, that my eloquence was in my complexion, the blu&s;h of &s;eventeen, or that in a world where humanity to women is the cha|racteri&s;tic

of advancing civilization, the beauty of a young girl was &s;o much more intere&s;ting than the di&s;tre&s;s of an old one. Pre&s;&s;ing my hand, he promi&s;ed to let Peggy remain in the hou&s;e as long as I wi&s;hed.&mdash;I more than returned the pre&s;&s;ure&mdash;I was &s;o grateful and &s;o happy. Emboldened by my innocent warmth, he then ki&s;&s;ed me&mdash;and I did not draw back&mdash;I took it for a ki&s;s of charity.</P>
<P>"Gay as a lark, I went to dine at mr. Vena|bles'. I had previou&s;ly obtained five &s;hillings from my father, towards re-clothing the poor chil|dren of my care, and prevailed on my mother to take one of the girls into the hou&s;e, whom I determined to teach to work and read.</P>
<P>"After dinner, when the younger part of the circle retired to the mu&s;ic room, I recounted with energy my tale; that is, I mentioned Peggy's di&s;tre&s;s, without hinting at the &s;teps I had taken to relieve her. Mi&s;s Venables gave me half-a-crown; the heir five &s;hillings; but George &s;at un|moved. I was cruelly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the di&s;appoint|ment&mdash;I &s;carcely could remain on my chair; and could I have got out of the room unperceived, I &s;hould have flown home, as if to run away from my&s;elf. After &s;everal vain attempts to ri&s;e, I leaned my head again&s;t the marble chimney-piece,
<PB N="120" REF="035555_0118_100561A7F01A7400">
and gazing on the ever-greens that filled the fire|place, moralized on the vanity of human expec|tations; regardle&s;s of the company. I was rou&s;ed by a gentle tap on my &s;houlder from behind Char|lotte's chair. I turned my head, and George &s;lid a guinea into my hand, putting his finger to my mouth to enjoin me &s;ilence.</P>
<P>"What a revolution took place, not only in my train of thoughts, but feelings! I trembled with emotion&mdash;now, indeed, I was in love.&mdash;Such delicacy too, to enhance his benevolence! I felt in my pocket every five minutes, only to feel the guinea; and its magic touch inve&s;ted my hero with more than mortal beauty. My fancy had found a ba&s;is to erect its model of perfection on; and quickly went to work, with all the happy credulity of youth, to con&s;ider that heart as de|voted to virtue, which had only obeyed a virtu|ous impul&s;e. The bitter experience was yet to come, that has taught me how very di&s;tinct are the principles of virtue, from the ca&s;ual feelings from which they germinate.</P>

<P>"I HAVE perhaps dwelt too long on a circum|&s;tance, which is only of importance as it marks the progre&s;s of a deception that has been &s;o fatal to my peace; and introduces to your notice a poor girl, whom, intending to &s;erve, I led to ruin. Still it is probably that I was not entirely the vic|tim of mi&s;take; and that your father, gradually fa&s;hioned by the world, did not become quickly what I he&s;itate to call him&mdash;out of re&s;pect to my daughter.</P>
<P>"But, to ha&s;ten to the more bu&s;y &s;cenes of my life. Mr. Venables and my mother died the &s;ame &s;ummer; and wholly engro&s;&s;ed by my at|tention to her, I thought of little el&s;e. The ne|glect of her darling, my brother Robert, had a violent effect on her weakened mind; for, though boys may be reckoned the pillars of the hou&s;e without doors, girls are often the only comfort within. They but too frequently wa&s;te their health and &s;pirits attending a dying parent, who
<PB N="122" REF="035555_0120_100561AB991A48E8">
leaves them in comparative poverty. After clo&s;|ing, with filial piety, a father's eyes, they are cha&s;ed from the paternal roof, to make room for the fir&s;t-born, the &s;on, who is to carry the empty family-name down to po&s;terity; though, occupied with his own plea&s;ures, he &s;carcely thought of di&s;|charging, in the decline of his parent's life, the debt contracted in his childhood. My mother's conduct led me to make the&s;e reflections. Great as was the fatigue I endured, and the affection my uncea&s;ing &s;olicitude evinced, of which my mo|ther &s;eemed perfectly &s;en&s;ible, &s;till, when my bro|ther, whom I could hardly per&s;uade to remain a quarter of an hour in her chamber, was with her alone, a &s;hort time before her death, &s;he gave him a little hoard, which &s;he had been &s;ome years accumulating.</P>
<P>"During my mother's illne&s;s, I was obliged to manage my father's temper, who, from the lingering nature of her malady, began to imagine that it was merely fancy. At this period, an artful kind of upper &s;ervant attracted my father's attention, and the neighbours made many remarks on the finery, not hone&s;tly got, exhibited at even|ing &s;ervice. But I was too much occupied with my mother to ob&s;erve any change in her dre&s;s or behaviour, or to li&s;ten to the whi&s;per of &s;candal.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="035555_0121_100561AEAEDF1D70">
"I &s;hall not dwell on the death-bed &s;cene, lively as is the remembrance, or on the emotion produced by the la&s;t gra&s;p of my mother's cold hand; when ble&s;&s;ing me, &s;he added, 'A little patience, and all will be over!' Ah! my child, how often have the&s;e words wrung mournfully in my ears&mdash;and I have exclaimed&mdash;'A little more patience, and I too &s;hall be at re&s;t!'</P>
<P>"My father was violently affected by her death, recollected in&s;tances of his unkindne&s;s, and wept like a child.</P>
<P>"My mother had &s;olemnly recommended my &s;i&s;ters to my care, and bid me be a mother to them. They, indeed, became more dear to me as they became more forlorn; for, during my mother's illne&s;s, I di&s;covered the ruined &s;tate of my father's circum&s;tances, and that he had only been able to keep up appearances, by the &s;ums which he bor|rowed from my uncle.</P>
<P>"My father's grief, and con&s;equent tenderne&s;s to his children, quickly abated, the hou&s;e grew &s;till more gloomy or riotous; and my refuge from care was again at mr. Venables'; the young '&s;quire having taken his father's place, and allow|ing, for the pre&s;ent, his &s;i&s;ter to pre&s;ide at his ta|ble,

George, though di&s;&s;atisfied with his portion of the fortune, which had till lately been all in trade, vi&s;ited the family as u&s;ual. He was now full of &s;peculations in trade, and his brow became clouded with care. He &s;eemed to relax in his attention to me, when the pre&s;ence of my uncle gave a new turn to his behaviour. I was too un|&s;u&s;pecting, too di&s;intere&s;ted, to trace the&s;e changes to their &s;ource.</P>
<P>My home every day became more and more di&s;agreeable to me; my liberty was unnece&s;&s;arily abridged, and my books, on the pretext that they made me idle, were taken from me. My father's mi&s;tre&s;s was with child, and he, doating on her, allowed or overlooked her vulgar manner of ty|rannizing over us. I was indignant, e&s;pecially when I &s;aw her endeavouring to attract, &s;hall I &s;ay &s;educe? my younger brother. By allowing wo|men but one way of ri&s;ing in the world, the fo&s;|tering the libertini&s;m of men, &s;ociety makes mon|&s;ters of them, and then their ignoble vices are brought forward as a proof of inferiority of intel|lect.</P>
<P>The weari&s;omene&s;s of my &s;ituation can &s;carcely be de&s;cribed. Though my life had not pa&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t even tenor with my mother, it was pa|radi&s;e
<PB N="125" REF="035555_0123_100561B2DFBFEA18">
to what I was de&s;tined to endure with my father's mi&s;tre&s;s, jealous of her illegitimate autho|rity. My father's former occa&s;ional tenderne&s;s, in &s;pite of his violence of temper, had been &s;ooth|ing to me; but now he only met me with re|proofs or portentous frowns. The hou&s;e-keeper, as &s;he was now termed, was the vulgar de&s;pot of the family; and a&s;&s;uming the new character of a fine lady, &s;he could never forgive the contempt which was &s;ometimes vi&s;ible in my countenance, when &s;he uttered with pompo&s;ity her bad Engli&s;h, or affected to be well-bred.</P>
<P>To my uncle I ventured to open my heart; and he, with his wonted benevolence, began to con&s;ider in what manner he could extricate me out of my pre&s;ent irk&s;ome &s;ituation. In &s;pite of his own di&s;appointment, or, mo&s;t probably, ac|tuated by the feelings that had been petrified, not cooled, in all their &s;anguine fervour, like a boil|ing torrent of lava &s;uddenly da&s;hing into the &s;ea, he thought a marriage of mutual inclination (would envious &s;tars permit it) the only chance for happine&s;s in this di&s;a&s;trous world. George Venables had the reputation of being attentive to bu&s;ine&s;s, and my father's example gave great weight to this circum&s;tance; for habits in order of bu&s;ine&s;s would, he conceived, extend to the
<PB N="126" REF="035555_0124_100561B4665BA420">
regulation of the affections in dome&s;tic life. George &s;eldom &s;poke in my uncle's company, ex|cept to utter a &s;hort judicious que&s;tion, or to make a pertinent remark, with all due deference to his &s;uperior judgment; &s;o that my uncle &s;el|dom left his company without ob&s;erving, that the young man had more in him than people &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>In this opinion he was not &s;ingular; yet, be|lieve me, and I am not &s;wayed by re&s;entment, the&s;e &s;peeches &s;o ju&s;tly poi&s;ed, this &s;ilent defer|ence, when the animal &s;pirits of other young peo|ple were throwing off u&s;eful ebullitions, were not the effect of thought or humility, but &s;heer bar|renne&s;s of mind, and want of imagination. A colt of mettle will curvet and &s;hew his paces. Yes; my dear girl, the&s;e prudent young men want all the fire nece&s;&s;ary to ferment their facul|ties, and are characteri&s;ed as wi&s;e, only becau&s;e they are not fooli&s;h. It is true, that George was by no means &s;o great a favourite of mine as dur|ing the fir&s;t year of our acquaintance; &s;till, as he often coincided in opinion with me, and echoed my &s;entiments; and having my&s;elf no other attachment, I heard with plea&s;ure my un|cle's propo&s;al; but thought more of obtaining my freedom, than of my lover. But, when George,
<PB N="127" REF="035555_0125_100561B680E03288">
&s;eemingly anxious for my happine&s;s, pre&s;&s;ed me to quit my pre&s;ent painful &s;ituation, my heart &s;welled with gratitude&mdash;I knew not that my un|cle had promi&s;ed him five thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>Had this truly generous man mentioned his intention to me, I &s;hould have in&s;i&s;ted on a thou|&s;and pound being &s;ettled on each of my &s;i&s;ters; George would have conte&s;ted; I &s;hould have &s;een his &s;elfi&s;h &s;oul; and&mdash;gracious God! have been &s;pared the mi&s;ery of di&s;covering, when too late, that I was united to a heartle&s;s, unprincipled wretch. All my &s;chemes of u&s;efulne&s;s would not then have been bla&s;ted. The tenderne&s;s of my heart would not have heated my imagination with vi&s;ions of the ineffable delight of happy love; nor would the &s;weet duty of a mother have been &s;o cruelly interrupted.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not &s;uffer the fortitude I have &s;o hardly acquired, to be undermined by unavailing regret. Let me ha&s;ten forward to de&s;cribe the turbid &s;tream in which I had to wade&mdash;but let me exultingly declare that it is pa&s;&s;ed&mdash;my &s;oul holds fellow&s;hip with him no more. He cut the Gordian knot, which my principles, mi&s;taken ones, re&s;pected; he di&s;&s;olved the tie, the fetters rather, that ate into my very vitals&mdash;and I &s;hould
<PB N="128" REF="035555_0126_100561B972911568">
rejoice, con&s;cious that my mind is freed though confined in hell it&s;elf; the only place that even fancy can imagine more dreadful than my pre&s;ent abode.</P>
<P>The&s;e varying emotions will not allow me to proceed. I heave &s;igh after &s;igh; yet my heart is &s;till oppre&s;&s;ed. For what am I re&s;erved? Why was I not born a man, or why was I born at all?</P>

<P>"I RESUME my pen to fly from thought.&mdash;I was married; and we ha&s;tened to London. I had purpo&s;ed to take one of my &s;i&s;ters with me; for a &s;trong motive for marrying, was the de&s;ire of having a home at which I could receive them, now their own grew &s;o uncomfortable, as not to de&s;erve the cheering appellation. An objection was made to her accompanying me, that ap|peared plau&s;ible; and I reluctantly acquie&s;ced. I was however willingly allowed to take with me Molly, poor Peggy's daughter. London and pre|ferment, are ideas commonly a&s;&s;ociated in the country; and as blooming as May, &s;he bid adieu to Peggy with weeping eyes. I did not even feel hurt at the refu&s;al in relation to my &s;i&s;ter, till hearing what my uncle had done for me, I had the &s;implicity to reque&s;t, &s;peaking with warmth of their &s;ituation, that he would give them a thou&s;and pounds a-piece, which &s;eemed to me but ju&s;tice. He a&s;ked me, giving me a ki&s;s, 'If I had lo&s;t my &s;en&s;es?' I &s;tarted back as if I had

found a wa&s;p in a ro&s;e bu&s;h. I expo&s;tulated. He &s;neered; and the demon of di&s;cord entered our paradi&s;e, to poi&s;on with his pe&s;tiferous breath every opening joy.</P>
<P>"I had &s;ometimes ob&s;erved defects in my hu&s;band's under&s;tanding; but, led a&s;tray by a prevailing opinion, that goodne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition is of the fir&s;t importance in the relative &s;ituations of life, in proportion as I perceived the narrowne&s;s of his under&s;tanding, fancy enlarged the boundary of his heart. Fatal error! How quickly is the &s;o-much-vaunted milkine&s;s of nature turned into gall, by an intercour&s;e with the world, if more generous juices do not &s;u&s;tain the vital &s;ource of virtue!</P>
<P>"One trait in my character was extreme cre|dulity; but when my eyes were once opened, I &s;aw but too clearly all I had before overlooked My hu&s;band was &s;unk in my e&s;teem; &s;till there are youthful emotions, which, for a while, fill up the cha&s;m of love and friend&s;hip.

<P>"Do not let me lead you a&s;tray, my child, I do not mean to a&s;&s;ert that any human being is en|tirely incapable of feeling the generous emotions, which are the foundation of every true principle of virtue; but they are frequently, I fear, &s;o feeble, that, like the inflammable quality which more or le&s;s lurks in all bodies, they often lie for ever dormant; the circum&s;tances never occurring, nece&s;&s;ary to call them into action.</P>
<P>"I di&s;covered, however, by chance, that, in con&s;equence of &s;ome lo&s;&s;es in trade, the natural effect of his gambling de&s;ire to &s;tart &s;uddenly into riches, the five thou&s;and pounds given me by my uncle, had been, paid very opportunely. This di&s;covery, &s;trange as you may think the a&s;&s;ertion, gave me plea&s;ure; my hu&s;band's embarra&s;&s;ments endeared me. I was glad to find an excu&s;e for his conduct to my &s;i&s;ters, and my mind became calmer.</P>

<P>"The&s;e were, at fir&s;t, &s;pontaneous emotions, though, becoming acquainted with men of wit and poli&s;hed manners, I could not &s;ometimes help regretting my early marriage; and that, in my ha&s;te to e&s;cape a temporary dependence, and ex|pand my newly fledged wings, in an unknown &s;ky, I had been caught in a trap and caged for life. Still the novelty of London, and the atten|tive fondne&s;s of my hu&s;band, for he had &s;ome per&s;onal regard for me, made &s;everal months glide away. Yet, not forgetting the &s;ituation of my &s;i&s;ters, who were &s;till very young, I prevailed on my uncle to &s;ettle a thou&s;and pounds on each; and to place them in a &s;chool near town, where I could frequently vi&s;it, as well as have them at home with me.</P>
<P>"I now tried to improve my hu&s;band's ta&s;te, but we had few &s;ubjects in common; indeed he &s;oon appeared to have little reli&s;h for my &s;ociety, unle&s;s he was hinting to me the u&s;e he could make of my uncle's wealth. When we had company,

<P>"With all my attention and affectionate in|tere&s;t, I perceived that I could not become the friend or confident of my hu&s;band. Every thing I learned relative to his affairs I gathered up by accident; and I vainly endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h at our fire-&s;ide, that &s;ocial conver&s;e which often renders people of different characters dear to each other. Returning from the theatre, or any amu&s;|ing party, I frequently began to relate what I had &s;een and highly reli&s;hed; but with &s;ilent tacitur|nity he &s;oon &s;ilenced me. I &s;eemed therefore gradually to lo&s;e, in his &s;ociety, the &s;oul, the ener|gies of which had ju&s;t been in action. To &s;uch a degree, in fact, did his cold, re&s;erved manner affect me that, after &s;pending &s;ome days with me alone, I have imagined my&s;elf the mo&s;t &s;tupid creature in the world, till the abilities of &s;ome ca&s;ual vi&s;itor convinced me that I had &s;ome dor|mant animation, and &s;entiments above the du&s;t in which I had been grovelling.

"I give you one view of the &s;ubject; but the&s;e experiments and alterations took up the &s;pace of five years; during which period, I had almo&s;t re|luctantly extorted &s;everal &s;ums from my uncle, to &s;ave my hu&s;band, to u&s;e his own words, from de&s;truction. At fir&s;t it was to prevent bills being prote&s;ted, to the injury of his credit; then to bail him; and afterwards to prevent an execution from entering the hou&s;e. I began at la&s;t to conclude, that he would have made more exertions of his own to extricate him&s;elf, had he not relied on mine, cruel as was the ta&s;k he impo&s;ed on me; and I firmly determined that I would make u&s;e of no more pretexts.</P>

I di&s;covered even by his conver&s;ation, when in|toxicated, that his favourites were wantons of the lowe&s;t cla&s;s, who could by their vulgar, in|decent mirth, which he called nature, rou&s;e his &s;luggi&s;h &s;pirits. Meretricious ornaments and man|ners were nece&s;&s;ary to attract his attention. He &s;eldom looked twice at a mode&s;t woman, and &s;at &s;ilent in their company; and the charms of youth and beauty had not the &s;lighte&s;t effect on his &s;en|&s;es, unle&s;s the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors were initiated in vice. His intimacy with profligate women, and his habits of thinking, gave him a contempt for fe|male endowments; and he would repeat, when wine had loo&s;ed his tongue, mo&s;t of the com|mon-place &s;arca&s;ms levelled at them, by men who do not allow them to have minds, becau&s;e mind would be an impediment to gro&s;s enjoyment.

"Women who have lo&s;t their hu&s;bands' affec|tion, are ju&s;tly reproved for neglecting their per|&s;ons, and not taking the &s;ame pains to keep, as to gain a heart; but who thinks of giving the &s;ame advice to men, though women are con|tinually &s;tigmatized for being attached to fops; and from the nature of their education, are more &s;u&s;ceptible of di&s;gu&s;t?

<P>At this juncture my father's mi&s;tre&s;s, by terri|fying his con&s;cience, prevailed on him to marry her; he was already become a methodi&s;t; and my brother, who now practi&s;ed for him&s;elf, had di&s;covered a flaw in the &s;ettlement made on my mother's children, which &s;at it a&s;ide, and he al|lowed my father, who&s;e di&s;tre&s;s made him &s;ubmit to any thing, a tithe of his own, or rather our for|tune.</P>

<P>"Soon after the death of my &s;i&s;ter, an incident occurred, to prove to me that the heart of a li|bertine is dead to natural affection; and to con|vince me, that the being who has appeared all tenderne&s;s, to gratify a &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ion, is as re|gardle&s;s of the innocent fruit of it, as of the ob|ject, when the fit is over. I had ca&s;ually ob&s;erved an old, mean-looking woman, who called on my hu&s;band every two or three months to receive &s;ome money. One day, entering the pa&s;&s;age of his little counting-hou&s;e, as &s;he was going out, I heard her &s;ay, 'The child is very weak; &s;he cannot live long, &s;he will &s;oon die out of your way, &s;o you need not grudge her a little phy&s;ic.'</P>

"'So much the better,' he replied&mdash;'and pray mind your own bu&s;ine&s;s, good woman.'</P>
<P>"I was &s;truck by his unfeeling, inhuman tone of voice, and drew back, determined when the woman came again, to try to &s;peak to her, not out of curio&s;ity, I had heard enough, but with the hope of being u&s;eful to a poor outca&s;t girl.</P>
<P>"A month or two elap&s;ed before I &s;aw this woman again; and then &s;he had a child in her hand that tottered along, &s;carcely able to &s;u&s;tain her own weight. They were going away, to re|turn at the hour mr. Venables was expected; he was now from home. I de&s;ired the woman to walk into the parlour. She he&s;itated, yet obeyed. I a&s;&s;ured her that I &s;hould not mention to my hu&s;band (the word &s;eemed to weigh on my re|&s;piration) that I had &s;een her, or his child. The woman &s;tared at me with a&s;toni&s;hment; and I turned my eyes on the &s;qualid object that accom|panied her. She could hardly &s;upport her&s;elf, her complexion was &s;allow, and her eyes inflamed, with an inde&s;cribable look of cunning, mixed with the wrinkles produced by the peevi&s;hne&s;s of pain.</P>
<P>"'Poor child!' I exclaimed. 'Ah, you may well &s;ay poor child,' replied the woman. 'I

Why, her legs bent under her like a bow, when &s;he came to me, and &s;he has never been well &s;ince; but, if they were no better paid than I am, it is not to be wondered at, &s;ure enough.'</P>
<P>"On further enquiry, I was informed, that this mi&s;erable &s;pectacle was the daughter of a &s;er|vant, a country girl, who caught mr. Venables' eye, and whom he &s;educed.

She was only paid three &s;hillings a week for board and wa&s;hing.</P>
<P>"The woman begged me to give her &s;ome old clothes for the child, a&s;&s;uring me that &s;he was almo&s;t afraid to a&s;k ma&s;ter for money to buy even a pair of &s;hoes.</P>

<P>"This conduct only in&s;pired me with com|pa&s;&s;ion.

Men, more effectually to en&s;lave us, may inculcate this partial morality, and lo&s;e &s;ight of virtue in &s;ubdividing it into the duties of particular &s;tations; but let us not blu&s;h for nature without a cau&s;e!</P>
<P>"After the&s;e remarks, I am a&s;hamed to own that I was pregnant. The greate&s;t &s;acrifice of my principles in my whole life, was the allowing my hu&s;band again to be familiar with my per&s;on, though to this cruel act of &s;elf-denial, when I wi&s;hed the earth to open and &s;wallow me, you owe your birth; and I the unutterable plea&s;ure of being a mother. There was &s;omething of deli|cacy in my hu&s;band's bridal attentions; but now his tainted breath, pimpled face, and blood-&s;hot eyes, were not more repugnant to my &s;en&s;es, than his gro&s;s manners, and lovele&s;s familiarity to my ta&s;te.</P>
<P>"A man would only be expected to maintain; yes, barely grant a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, to a woman ren|dered odious by habitual intoxication; but who

would expect him, or think it po&s;&s;ible to love her? And unle&s;s 'youth, and genial years were flown,' it would be thought equally unrea&s;onable to in&s;i&s;t, (under penalty of) forfeiting almo&s;t every thing reckoned valuable in life, that he &s;hould not love another: whil&s;t woman, weak in rea&s;on, impotent in will, is required to moralize, &s;entimentalize her&s;elf to &s;tone, and pine her life away, labouring to reform her embruted mate. He may even &s;pend in di&s;&s;ipation, and intemperance, the very intemperance which renders him &s;o hateful, her property, and by &s;tinting her expen&s;es, not per|mit her to beguile in &s;ociety, a weari&s;ome joyle&s;s life; for over their mutual fortune &s;he has no power, it mu&s;t all pa&s;s through his hand. And if &s;he be a mother, and in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of women, it is a great misfortune to be prevented from di&s;charging the duties, and cultivating the affections of one, what has &s;he not to endure?&mdash;But I have &s;uffered the tenderne&s;s of one to lead me into reflections that I did not think of making, to interrupt my narrative&mdash;yet the full heart will overflow.</P>
<P>"Mr. Venables' embarra&s;&s;ments did not now endear him to me; &s;till, anxious to befriend him, I endeavoured to prevail on him to retrench his expen&s;es; but he had always &s;ome plau&s;ible ex|cu&s;e

to give, to ju&s;tify his not following my advice. Humanity, compa&s;&s;ion, and the intere&s;t produced by a habit of living together, made me try to re|lieve, and &s;ympathize with him; but, when I re|collected that I was bound to live with &s;uch a being for ever&mdash;my heart died within me; my de&s;ire of improvement became languid, and baleful, corroding melancholy took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my &s;oul. Marriage had ba&s;tiled me for life. I di&s;covered in my&s;elf a capacity for the enjoyment of the va|rious plea&s;ures exi&s;tence affords; yet, fettered by the partial laws of &s;ociety, this fair globe was to me an univer&s;al blank.</P>
<P>"When I exhorted my hu&s;band to economy, I referred to him&s;elf. I was obliged to practi&s;e the mo&s;t rigid, or contract debts, which I had too much rea&s;on to fear would never be paid. I de&s;|pi&s;ed this paltry privilege of a wife, which can only be of u&s;e to the vicious or incon&s;iderate, and determined not to increa&s;e the torrent that was bearing him down. I was then ignorant of the extent of his fraudulent &s;peculations, whom I was bound to honour and obey.</P>

her. Be&s;ides, the forlorn &s;tate of a neglected woman, not de&s;titute of per&s;onal charms, is par|ticularly intere&s;ting, and rou&s;es that &s;pecies of pity, which is &s;o near akin, it ea&s;ily &s;lides into love. A man of feeling thinks not of &s;educing, he is him|&s;elf &s;educed by all the noble&s;t emotions of his &s;oul. He figures to him&s;elf all the &s;acrifices a woman of &s;en&s;ibility mu&s;t make, and every &s;itua|tion in which his imagination places her, touches his heart, and fires his pa&s;&s;ions. Longing to take to his bo&s;om the &s;horn lamb, and bid the droop|ing buds of hope revive, benevolence changes into pa&s;&s;ion; and &s;hould he then di&s;cover that he is beloved, honour binds him fa&s;t, though fore&s;ee|ing that he may afterwards be obliged to pay &s;evere damages to the man, who never appeared to value his wife's &s;ociety, till he found that there was a chance of his being indemnified for the lo&s;s of it.</P>
<P>"Such are the partial laws enacted by men; for, only to lay a &s;tre&s;s on the dependent &s;tate of a woman in the grand que&s;tion of the comforts ari&s;ing from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of property, &s;he is (even in this article) much more injured by the lo&s;s of the hu&s;band's affection, than he by that of his wife; yet where is &s;he, condemned to the &s;oli|tude of a de&s;erted home, to look for a compen|&s;ation
<PB N="152" REF="035555_0150_100561EC7579A2E0">
from the woman, who &s;educes him from her? She cannot drive an unfaithful hu&s;band from his hou&s;e, nor &s;eparate, or tear, his chil|dren from him, however culpable he may be; and he, &s;till the ma&s;ter of his own fate, enjoys the &s;miles of a world, that would brand her with infamy, did &s;he, &s;eeking con&s;olation, ven|ture to retaliate.</P>
<P>"The&s;e remarks are not dictated by experi|ence; but merely by the compa&s;&s;ion I feel for many amiable women, the <HI>out-laws</HI> of the world. For my&s;elf, never encouraging any of the ad|vances that were made to me, my lovers dropped off like the untimely &s;hoots of &s;pring. I did not even coquet with them; becau&s;e I found, on ex|amining my&s;elf, I could not coquet with a man without loving him a little; and I perceived that I &s;hould not be able to &s;top at the line of what are termed <HI>innocent freedoms,</HI> did I &s;uffer any. My re&s;erve was then the con&s;equence of delicacy. Freedom of conduct has emancipated many wo|men's minds; but my conduct has mo&s;t rigidly been governed by my principles, till the improve|ment of my under&s;tanding has enabled me to di&s;|cern the fallacy of prejudices at war with nature and rea&s;on.</P>

"Shortly after the change I have mentioned in my hu&s;band's conduct, my uncle was com|pelled by his declining health, to &s;eek the &s;uccour of a milder climate, and embark for Li&s;bon. He left his will in the hands of a friend, an eminent &s;olicitor; he had previou&s;ly que&s;tioned me rela|tive to my &s;ituation and &s;tate of mind, and de|clared very freely, that he could place no reliance on the &s;tability of my hu&s;band's profe&s;&s;ions. He had been deceived in the unfolding of his character; he now thought it fixed in a train of actions that would inevitably lead to ruin and di&s;grace.</P>
<P>"The evening before his departure, which we &s;pent alone together, he folded me to his heart, uttering the endearing appellation of&mdash;'child'&mdash;My more than father! why was I not per|mitted to perform the la&s;t duties of one, and &s;mooth the pillow of death? He &s;eemed by his manner to be convinced that he &s;hould never &s;ee me more; yet reque&s;ted me, mo&s;t earne&s;tly, to come to him, &s;hould I be obliged to leave my hu&s;band. He had before expre&s;&s;ed a &s;orrow at hearing of my pregnancy, having determined to prevail on me to accompany him, till I informed him of that circum&s;tance. He expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf unfeignedly &s;orry that any new tie &s;hould bind

me to a man whom he thought &s;o incapable of e&s;timating my value;&mdash;&s;uch was the kind lan|guage of affection.</P>
<P>"I mu&s;t repeat his own words; they made an indelible impre&s;&s;ion on my mind:</P>
<Q><P>The marriage &s;tate is certainly that in which women, generally &s;peaking, can be mo&s;t u&s;eful; but I am far from thinking that a wo|man, once married, ought to con&s;ider the en|gagement as indi&s;&s;oluble (e&s;pecially if there be no children to reward her for &s;acrificing her feelings) in ca&s;e her hu&s;band merits neither her love, nor e&s;teem. E&s;teem will often &s;upply the place of love, and prevent a woman from being wretched, though it may not make her happy. The magnitude of a &s;acrifice ought always to bear &s;ome proportion to the utility in view; and for a woman to live with a man for whom &s;he can cheri&s;h neither affection nor e&s;teem, or even be of any u&s;e to him, excepting in the light of a hou&s;e-keeper, is an abjectne&s;s of condition, the enduring of which no concurrence of circum|&s;tances can ever make a duty in the &s;ight of God or ju&s;t men. If indeed &s;he &s;ubmits to it merely to be maintained in idlene&s;s, &s;he has no right to complain bitterly of her fate, or to
<PB N="155" REF="035555_0153_100561F2D7F56470">
act, as a per&s;on of independent character might, as if &s;he had a title to di&s;regard general rules.</P>
<P>But the misfortune is, that many women only &s;ubmit in appearance, and forfeit their own re&s;pect to &s;ecure their reputation in the world. The &s;ituation of a woman &s;eparated from her hu&s;band is undoubtedly very different from that of a man who has left his wife. He, with lordly dignity, has &s;haken off a clog; and the allowing her food and raiment is thought &s;ufficient to &s;ecure his reputation from taint. And, &s;hould &s;he have been incon&s;iderate, he will be celebrated for his genero&s;ity and for|bearance. Such is the re&s;pect paid to the ma&s;ter-key of property! A woman, on the contrary, re&s;igning what is termed her natural protector (though he never was &s;o, but in name), is de&s;pi&s;ed and &s;hunned for a&s;&s;erting the inde|pendence of mind di&s;tinctive of a rational being, and &s;purning at &s;lavery.</P></Q>
<P>"During the remainder of the evening, my uncle's tenderne&s;s led him frequently to revert to the &s;ubject, and utter, with increa&s;ing warmth, &s;entiments to the &s;ame purport. At length it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay 'Farewel!'&mdash;and we parted&mdash;gracious God! to meet no more.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<P>"A GENTLEMAN of large fortune and of poli&s;hed manners, had lately vi&s;ited very fre|quently at our hou&s;e, and treated me, if po&s;&s;ible, with more re&s;pect than mr. Venables paid him; my pregnancy was not yet vi&s;ible, his &s;ociety was a great relief to me, as I had for &s;ome time pa&s;t, to avoid expence, confined my&s;elf very much at home. I ever di&s;dained unnece&s;&s;ary, perhaps even prudent concealments&mdash;and my hu&s;band, with great ea&s;e, di&s;covered the amount of my uncle's parting pre&s;ent. A copy of a writ was the &s;tale pretext to extort it from me; and I had &s;oon rea|&s;on to believe that it was fabricated for the pur|po&s;e. I acknowledge my folly in thus suffering my&s;elf to be continually impo&s;ed on. I had ad|hered to my re&s;olution not to apply to my uncle, on the part of my hu&s;band, any more; yet, when I had received a &s;um &s;ufficient to &s;upply my own wants, and to enable me to pur&s;ue a plan I had in view, to &s;ettle my younger brother in a re&s;pect|able employment, I allowed my&s;elf to be duped by mr. Venables' &s;hallow pretences, and hypocri|tical profe&s;&s;ions</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="035555_0155_100561F88EA4B010">
"Thus did he pillage me and my family&mdash;thus fru&s;trate all my plans of u&s;efulne&s;s. Yet this was the man I was bound to re&s;pect and e&s;teem: as if re&s;pect and e&s;teem depended on an arbitrary will of our own! But a wife being as much a man's property as his hor&s;e, or his a&s;s, &s;he has nothing that &s;he can call her own. He may u&s;e any means to get at what the law con&s;iders as his, the moment his wife is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, even to the forcing of a lock, as mr. Venables did, to &s;earch for notes in my writing-de&s;k&mdash;and all this is done with a &s;hew of equity&mdash;becau&s;e, for&s;ooth, he is re&s;pon&s;ible for her maintenance.</P>
<P>"The tender mother cannot <HI>lawfully</HI> &s;natch from the gripe of the gambling &s;pendthrift, or bea&s;tly drunkard, unmindful of his offspring, the fortune which falls to her by chance: or (&s;o flagrant is the inju&s;tice) what &s;he earns by her own exertions. No; he can rob her with im|punity, even to wa&s;te publicly on a courtezan&mdash;and the laws of her country&mdash;if women have a country&mdash;afford her no protection or redre&s;s from the oppre&s;&s;or, unle&s;s &s;he have the plea of bodily fear; yet how many ways are there of goading the &s;oul almo&s;t to madne&s;s, equally unmanly, though not &s;o mean? When &s;uch laws were framed, &s;hould not impartial lawgivers have fir&s;t
<PB N="158" REF="035555_0156_100561FA13A56B40">
decreed, in the &s;tyle of a great a&s;&s;embly, who recognized the exi&s;tence of an <HI>&ecirc;tre &s;upr&ecirc;me,</HI> to fix the national belief, that the hu&s;band &s;hould al|ways be wi&s;er and more virtuous than his wife, in order to entitle him, with a &s;hew of ju&s;tice, to keep this idiot, or perpetual minor, for ever in bondage. But I mu&s;t have done&mdash;on this &s;ubject, my indignation continually runs away with me.</P>
<P>"The company of the gentleman I have al|ready mentioned, who had a general acquaintance with literature and &s;ubjects of ta&s;te, was grateful to me; my countenance brightened up as he ap|proached, and I unaffectedly expre&s;&s;ed the plea|&s;ure I felt. The amu&s;ement his conver&s;ation afforded me, made it ea&s;y to comply with my hu&s;band's reque&s;t, to endeavour to render our hou&s;e agreeable to him.</P>
<P>"His attentions became more pointed; but as I was not of the number of women, who&s;e virtue, as it is termed, immediately takes alarm, I en|deavoured, rather by raillery than &s;erious expo&s;|tulation, to give a different turn to his conver&s;ation. He a&s;&s;umed a new mode of attack, and I was, for a while, the dupe of his pretended friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>"I had, merely in the &s;tile of <HI>badinage,</HI> boa&s;ted
<PB N="159" REF="035555_0157_100561FC72DAD068">
of my conque&s;t, and repeated his lover-like com|pliments to my hu&s;band. But he begged me, for God's &s;ake, not to affront his friend, or I &s;hould de&s;troy all his projects, and be his ruin. Had I had more affection for my hu&s;band, I &s;hould have expre&s;&s;ed my contempt of this time-&s;erving politene&s;s: now I imagined that I only felt pity; yet it would have puzzled a ca&s;ui&s;t to point out in what the exact difference con&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>"This friend began now, in confidence, to di&s;cover to me the real &s;tate of my hu&s;band's af|fairs. 'Nece&s;&s;ity,' &s;aid mr. S&mdash;; why &s;hould I reveal his name? for he affected to palliate the conduct he could not excu&s;e, 'had led him to take &s;uch &s;teps, by accommodation bills, buying goods on credit, to &s;ell them for ready money, and &s;imilar tran&s;actions, that his character in the commercial world was gone. He was con&s;idered,' he added, lowering his voice, 'on 'Change as a &s;windler.'</P>
<P>"I felt at that moment the fir&s;t maternal pang. Aware of the evils my &s;ex have to &s;truggle with, I &s;till wi&s;hed, for my own con&s;olation, to be the mother of a daughter; and I could not bear to think, that the <HI>&s;ins</HI> of her father's entailed di&s;grace &s;hould be added to the ills to which woman is heir.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="035555_0158_100561FFB023AF48">
"So completely was I deceived by the&s;e &s;hows of friend&s;hip (nay, I believe, according to his in|terpretation, mr. S&mdash;really was my friend) that I began to con&s;ult him re&s;pecting the be&s;t mode of retrieving my hu&s;band's character: it is the good name of a woman only that "&s;ets to ri&s;e no more." I knew not that he had beeen drawn into a whirlpool, out of which he had not the energy to attempt to e&s;cape. He &s;eemed indeed de&s;titute of the power of employing his faculties in any re|gular pur&s;uit. His principles of action were &s;o loo&s;e, and his mind &s;o uncultivated, that every thing like order appeared to him in the &s;hape of re&s;traint; and, like men in the &s;avage &s;tate, he required the &s;trong &s;timulus of hope or fear, produced by wild &s;peculations, in which the in|tere&s;ts of others went for nothing, to keep his &s;pirits awake.&mdash;He one time profe&s;&s;ed patrioti&s;m, but he knew not what it was to feel hone&s;t indignation; and pretended to be an advocate for liberty, when, with as little affection for the human race as for individuals, he thought of nothing but his own gratification. He was ju&s;t &s;uch a citizen as a father. The &s;ums he adroitly obtained by a vio|lation of the laws of his country, as well as tho&s;e of humanity, he would allow a mi&s;tre&s;s to &s;quan|der; though &s;he was, with the &s;ame <HI>&s;ang froid,</HI>
<PB N="161" REF="035555_0159_10056201DA1619C0">
con&s;igned, as were his children, to poverty, when another proved more attractive.</P>
<P>"On various pretences, his friend continued to vi&s;it me; and, ob&s;erving my want of money, he tried to induce me to accept of pecuniary aid; but this offer I ab&s;olutely rejected, though it was made with &s;uch delicacy, I could not be di&s;plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>"One day he came, as I thought, accidentally to dinner. My hu&s;band was very much engaged in bu&s;ine&s;s, and quitted the room &s;oon after the cloth was removed. We conver&s;ed as u&s;ual, till confidential advice led again to love. I was ex|tremely mortified. I had a &s;incere regard for him, and hoped that he had an equal friend&s;hip for me. I therefore began mildly to expo&s;tulate with him. This gentlene&s;s he mi&s;took for coy encourage|ment; and he would not be diverted from the &s;ubject. Perceiving his mi&s;take, I &s;eriou&s;ly a&s;ked him how, u&s;ing &s;uch language to me, he could profe&s;s to be my hu&s;band's friend? A &s;ignificant &s;neer excited my curio&s;ity, and he, &s;uppo&s;ing this to be my only &s;cruple, took a letter deliberately out of his pocket, &s;aying, 'Your hu&s;band's ho|nour is not inflexible. How could you, with your di&s;cernment, think it &s;o? Why, he left the room this very day on purpo&s;e to give me an

opportunity to explain my&s;elf; <HI>he</HI> thought me too timid&mdash;too tardy.'</P>
<P>"I &s;natched the letter with inde&s;cribable emo|tion. The purport of it was to invite him to din|ner, and to ridicule his chivalrous re&s;pect for me. He a&s;&s;ured him, 'that every woman had her price, and, with gro&s;s indecency, hinted, that he &s;hould be glad to have the duty of a hu&s;band ta|ken off his hands. The&s;e he termed <HI>liberal &s;enti|ments.</HI> He advi&s;ed him not to &s;hock my roman|tic notions, but to attack my credulous genero&s;ity, and weak pity; and concluded with reque&s;ting him to lend him five hundred pounds for a month or &s;ix weeks.' I read this letter twice over; and the firm purpo&s;e it in&s;pired, calmed the ri&s;ing tumult of my &s;oul. I ro&s;e deliberately, reque&s;ted mr. S&mdash;to wait a moment, and in&s;tantly go|ing into the counting-hou&s;e, de&s;ired mr. Vena|bles to return with me to the dining-parlour.</P>
<P>"He laid down his pen, and entered with me, without ob&s;erving any change in my countenance. I &s;hut the door, and, giving him the letter, &s;im|ply a&s;ked, 'whether he wrote it, or was it a for|gery?'</P>
<P>"Nothing could equal his confu&s;ion. His

<P>"I continued with &s;olemnity, 'I have borne with your tyranny and infidelities. I di&s;dain to utter what I have borne with. I thought you unprincipled, but not &s;o decidedly vicious. I formed a tie in the &s;ight of heaven&mdash;I have held it &s;acred; even when men, more conformable to my ta&s;te, have made me feel&mdash;I de&s;pi&s;e all &s;ubter|fuge! that I was not dead to love. Neglected by you, I have re&s;olutely &s;tifled the enticing emo|tions, and re&s;pected the plighted faith you out|raged. And you dare now to in&s;ult me, by &s;elling me to pro&s;titution!&mdash;Yes&mdash;equally lo&s;t to delicacy and principle&mdash;you dared &s;acrilegiou&s;ly to barter the honour of the mother of your child.'</P>
<P>"Then, turning to mr. S&mdash;, I added&mdash;'I call on you, &s;ir, to witne&s;s,' and I lifted my hands and eyes to heaven, 'that, as &s;olemnly as I took his name, I now abjure it,' I pulled off my ring, and put it on the table; 'and that I mean to quit his hou&s;e, never to enter it more. I will provide for my&s;elf and child. I leave him as free as I am de|termined to be my&s;elf&mdash;he &s;hall be an&s;werable for no debts of mine.'</P>

"A&s;toni&s;hment clo&s;ed their lips, till mr.

He bade me 'leave the hou&s;e at my peril; told me he de&s;pi&s;ed my threats; I had no re&s;ource; I could not &s;wear the peace again&s;t him!&mdash;I was not afraid of my life!&mdash;He had never &s;truck me!'</P>
<P>"He threw the letter in the fire, which I had incautiou&s;ly left in his hands; and, quitting the room, locked the door on me.</P>
<P>"When left alone, I was a moment or two before I could recollect my&s;elf. One &s;cene had &s;ucceeded another with &s;uch rapidity, I almo&s;t doubted whether I was reflecting on a real event.

A &s;eraphic &s;atisfaction animated, without agitating my &s;pirits, and my imagination collected, in vi&s;ions &s;ublimely terrible, or &s;ooth|ingly beautiful, an immen&s;e variety of the endle&s;s images, which nature affords, and fancy combines, of the grand and fair. The lu&s;tre of the&s;e bright picture&s;que &s;ketches faded with the &s;etting &s;un;&mdash;but I was &s;till alive to the calm delight they had diffu&s;ed through my heart.</P>
<P>"There may be advocates for matrimonial obedience, who, making a di&s;tinction between the duty of a wife and of a human being, may blame my conduct&mdash;To them I write not&mdash;my felings are not for them to analyze; and may you, my child, never be able to a&s;certain, by heart|rending experience, what your mother felt before the pre&s;ent emancipation of her mind!</P>
<P>"I began to write a letter to my father, after clo&s;ing one to my uncle; not to a&s;k advice, but to &s;ignify my determination; when I was interrupted by the entrance of mr. Venables. His manner
<PB N="166" REF="035555_0164_10056209EE7860A8">
was changed. His views on my uncle's fortune made him aver&s;e to my quitting the hou&s;e, or he would, I am convinced, have been glad to have &s;haken off even the &s;light re&s;traint my pre&s;ence impo&s;ed on him; the re&s;traint of &s;howing me &s;ome re&s;pect. So far from having an affection for me, he really hated me, becau&s;e he was con|vinced that I mu&s;t de&s;pi&s;e him.</P>
<P>"He told me, that, 'As I now had had time to cool and reflect, he did not doubt but that my prudence, and nice &s;en&s;e of propriety, would lead me to overlook what was pa&s;&s;ed.'</P>
<P>"'Reflection,' I replied, 'had only confirmed my purpo&s;e, and no power on earth could divert me from it.'</P>
<P>"Endeavouring to a&s;&s;ume a &s;oothing voice and look, when he would willingly have tortured me, to force me to feel his power, his countenance had an infernal expre&s;&s;ion, when he de&s;ired me, 'Not to expo&s;e my&s;elf to the &s;ervants, by obliging him to confine me in my apartment; if then I would give my promi&s;e not to quit the hou&s;e precipi|tately, I &s;hould be free&mdash;and&mdash;.' I declared, in|terrupting him, that I would promi&s;e nothing. I had no mea&s;ures to keep with him&mdash;I was re&s;olved, and would not conde&s;cend to &s;ubterfuge.'</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="035555_0165_1005620C283C4330">
"He muttered, 'that I &s;hould &s;oon repent of the&s;e prepo&s;terous airs; and ordering tea to be carried into my little &s;tudy, which had a commu|nication with my bed-chamber, he once more locked the door upon me, and left me to my own meditations. I had pa&s;&s;ively followed him up &s;tairs, not wi&s;hing to fatigue my&s;elf with unavail|ing exertion.</P>
<P>"Nothing calms the mind like a fixed purpo&s;e. I felt as if I had heaved a thou&s;and weight from my heart; the atmo&s;phere &s;eemed lightened; and, if I execrated the in&s;titutions of &s;ociety, which thus enabled men to tyrannize over women, it was almo&s;t a di&s;intere&s;ted &s;entiment. I di&s;re|garded pre&s;ent inconveniences, when my mind had done &s;truggling with it&s;elf&mdash;when rea&s;on and inclination had &s;haken hands, and were at peace. I had no longer the cruel ta&s;k before me, in end|le&s;s per&s;pective, aye, during the tedious for ever of life, of labouring to overcome my repugnance&mdash;of labouring to extingui&s;h the hopes, the may|be's of a lively imagination. Death I had hailed as my only chance of deliverance; but, while exi&s;tence had &s;o many charms, and life promi&s;ed happine&s;s, I &s;hrunk from the icy arms of an un|known tyrant, though far more inviting than tho&s;e of the man, to whom I found my&s;elf bound with|out
<PB N="168" REF="035555_0166_1005620E90A01698">
any other alternative, and was content to lin|ger a little longer, waiting for I know not what, rather than leave 'the warm precincts of the chearful day,' and all the unenjoyed affection of my nature.</P>
<P>"My pre&s;ent &s;ituation gave a new turn to my reflection; and I wondered (now the film &s;eemed to be withdrawn, that ob&s;cured the piercing &s;ight of rea&s;on) how I could, previou&s;ly to the deciding outrage, have con&s;idered my&s;elf as everla&s;tingly united to vice and folly! 'Had an evil genius ca&s;t a &s;pell at my birth; or a daemon &s;tept out of chaos, to perplex my under&s;tanding, and enchain my will, with delu&s;ive prejudices?'</P>
<P>"I pur&s;ued this train of thinking; it led me out of my&s;elf, to expatiate on the mi&s;ery peculiar to my &s;ex. 'Are not,' 'I thought, the de&s;pots for ever &s;tigmati&s;ed, who, in the wantonne&s;s of power, commanded even the mo&s;t atrocious criminals to be chained to dead bodies? though &s;urely tho&s;e laws are much more inhuman, which forge adamantine &s;etters to bind minds together, that never can mingle in &s;ocial communion! What indeed can equal the wretchedne&s;s of that &s;tate, in which there is no alternative, but to ex|tingui&s;h the affections, or encounter infamy?'</P>

<P>"TOWARDS midnight mr. Venables en|tered my chamber; and, with calm audacity pre|paring to go to bed, he bade me make ha&s;te, 'for that was the be&s;t place for hu&s;bands and wives to end their differences.' He had been drinking plentifully to aid his courage.</P>
<P>"I did not at fir&s;t deign to reply. But per|ceiving that he affected to take my &s;ilence for con&s;ent, I told him that, 'If he would not go to another bed, or allow me, I &s;hould &s;it up in my &s;tudy all night.' He attempted to pull me into the chamber, half joking. But I re&s;i&s;ted; and, as he had determined not to give me any rea&s;on for &s;aying that he u&s;ed violence, after a few more efforts, he retired, cur&s;ing my ob&s;tinacy, to bed.</P>
<P>"I &s;at mu&s;ing &s;ome time longer; then throw|ing my cloak around me, prepared for &s;leep on a &s;ofa. And, &s;o fortunate &s;eemed my deliverance, &s;o &s;acred the plea&s;ure of being thus wrapped up
<PB N="170" REF="035555_0168_10056214018B89D0">
in my&s;elf, that I &s;lept profoundly, and woke with a mind compo&s;ed to encounter the &s;truggles of the day. Mr. Venables did not wake till &s;ome hours after; and then he came to me half-dre&s;&s;ed, yawning and &s;tretching, with haggard eyes, as if he &s;carcely recollected what had pa&s;&s;ed the pre|ceding evening. He fixed his eyes on me for a moment, then, calling me a fool, a&s;ked, 'How long I intended to continue this pretty farce? For his part, he was devili&s;h &s;ick of it; but this was the plague of marrying women who pretend to know &s;omething.'</P>
<P>"I made no other reply to this harangue, than to &s;ay, 'That he ought to be glad to get rid of a woman &s;o unfit to be his companion&mdash;and that any change in my conduct would be mean di&s;&s;i|mulation; for maturer reflection only gave the &s;acred &s;eal of rea&s;on to my fir&s;t re&s;olution.'</P>
<P>"He looked as if he could have &s;tamped with impatience, at being obliged to &s;tifle his rage; but, conquering his anger (for weak people, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions &s;eem the mo&s;t ungovernable, re&s;train them with the greate&s;t ea&s;e, when they have a &s;ufficient motive), he exclaimed, 'Very pretty, upon my &s;oul! very pretty theatrical flouri&s;hes! Pray, fair Roxana, &s;toop from your altitudes, and
<PB N="171" REF="035555_0169_10056215866F4B08">
remember that you are acting a part in real life.'</P>
<P>"He uttered this &s;peech with a &s;elf-&s;atisfied air, and went down &s;tairs to dre&s;s.</P>
<P>"In about an hour he came to me again; and in the &s;ame tone &s;aid, 'That he came as my gentleman-u&s;her, to hand me down to breakfa&s;t.'</P>
<P>"'Of the black rod?' a&s;ked I.</P>
<P>"This que&s;tion, and the tone in which I a&s;ked it, a little di&s;concerted him. To &s;ay the truth, I now felt no re&s;entment; my firm re&s;olution to free my&s;elf from my ignoble thraldom, had ab|&s;orbed the various emotions which, during &s;ix years, had racked my &s;oul. The duty pointed out by my principles &s;eemed clear; and not one tender feeling intruded to make me &s;werve. The di&s;like which my hu&s;band had in&s;pired was &s;trong; but it only led me to wi&s;h to avoid, to wi&s;h to let him drop out of my memory; there was no mi|&s;ery, no torture that I would not deliberately have cho&s;en, rather than renew my lea&s;e of &s;ervitude.</P>
<P>"During the breakfa&s;t he attempted to rea&s;on with me on the folly of romantic &s;entiments; for
<PB N="172" REF="035555_0170_10056217AE7CCD78">
this was the indi&s;criminate epithet he gave to every mode of conduct or thinking &s;uperior to his own. He a&s;&s;erted, 'that all the world were go|verned by their own intere&s;t; tho&s;e who pre|tended to be actuated by different motives, were only deeper knaves, or fools crazed by books, who took for go&s;pel all the rodomontade non&s;en&s;e written by men who knew nothing of the world. For his part, he thanked God, he was no hypo|crite; and, if he &s;tretched a point &s;ometimes, it was always with an intention of paying every man his own.</P>
<P>"He then artfully in&s;inuated, that he daily expected a ve&s;&s;el to arrive, a &s;ucce&s;sful &s;pecula|tion, that would make him ea&s;y for the pre&s;ent, and that he had &s;everal other &s;chemes actually depending, that could not fail. He had no doubt of becoming rich in a few years, though he had been thrown back by &s;ome unlucky adventures at the &s;etting out.'</P>
<P>"I mildly replied, 'That I wi&s;hed he might not involve him&s;elf &s;till deeper.'</P>
<P>"He had no notion that I was governed by a deci&s;ion of judgment, not to be compared with a mere &s;purt of re&s;entment. He knew not what it
<PB N="173" REF="035555_0171_1005621AACFFA358">
was to feel indignation again&s;t vice, and often boa&s;ted of his placable temper, and readine&s;s to forgive injuries. True; for he only con&s;idered the being deceived, as an effort of &s;kill he had not guarded again&s;t; and then, with a cant of can|dour, would ob&s;erve, 'that he did not know how he might him&s;elf have been tempted to act in the &s;ame circum&s;tances.' And, as his heart never opened to friend&s;hip, it never was wounded by di&s;appointment.&mdash;Every new acquaintance he pro|te&s;ted, it is true, was 'the clevere&s;t fellow in the world;' and he really thought &s;o; till the novelty of his conver&s;ation or manners cea&s;ed to have any effect on his &s;luggi&s;h &s;pirits. His re|&s;pect for rank or fortune was more permanent, though he chanced to have no de&s;ign of availing him&s;elf of the influence of either to promote his own views.</P>
<P>"After a prefatory conver&s;ation,&mdash;my blood (I thought it had been cooler) flu&s;hed over my whole countenance as he &s;poke&mdash;he alluded to my &s;ituation. He de&s;ired me to reflect&mdash;'and act like a prudent woman, as the be&s;t proof of my &s;uperior under&s;tanding; for he mu&s;t own I had &s;en&s;e, did I know how to u&s;e it. I was not,' he laid a &s;tre&s;s on his words, 'without my pa&s;&s;ions; and a hu&s;band was a convenient cloke.&mdash;He was
<PB N="174" REF="035555_0172_1005621CF96200A0">
liberal in his way of thinking; and why might not we, like many other married people, who were above vulgar prejudices, tacitly con&s;ent to let each other follow their own inclination?&mdash;He meant nothing more, in the letter I made the ground of complaint; and the plea&s;ure which I &s;eemed to take in mr. S.'s company, led him to conclude, that he was not di&s;agreeable to me.'</P>
<P>"A clerk brought in the letters of the day, and I, as I often did, while he was di&s;cu&s;&s;ing &s;ub|jects of bu&s;ine&s;s, went to the <HI>piano forte,</HI> and be|gan to play a favourite air to re&s;tore my&s;elf, as it were, to nature, and drive the &s;ophi&s;ticated &s;entiments I had ju&s;t been obliged to li&s;ten to, out of my &s;oul.</P>
<P>"They had excited &s;en&s;ations &s;imilar to tho&s;e I have felt, in viewing the &s;qualid inhabitants of &s;ome of the lanes and back &s;treets of the metropolis, mortified at being compelled to con&s;ider them as my fellow-creatures, as if an ape had claimed kindred with me. Or, as when &s;urrounded by a mephitical fog, I have wi&s;hed to have a volley of cannon fired, to clear the incumbered atmo&s;phere, and give me room to breathe and move.</P>
<P>"My &s;pirits were all in arms, and I played a
<PB N="175" REF="035555_0173_1005621E81BB9698">
kind of extemporary prelude. The cadence was probably wild and impa&s;&s;ioned, while, lo&s;t in thought, I made the &s;ounds a kind of echo to my train of thinking.</P>
<P>"Pau&s;ing for a moment, I met mr. Venables' eyes. He was ob&s;erving me with an air of con|ceited &s;atisfaction, as much as to &s;ay&mdash;'My la&s;t in&s;inuation has done the bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;&s;he begins to know her own intere&s;t.' Then gathering up his letters, he &s;aid, 'That he hoped that he &s;hould hear no more romantic &s;tuff, well enough in a mi&s;s ju&s;t come from a boarding-&s;chool;' and went, as was his cu&s;tom, to the counting-hou&s;e. I &s;till continued playing; and turning to a &s;prightly le&s;|&s;on, I executed it with uncommon vivacity. I heard foot&s;teps approach the door, and was &s;oon convinced that mr. Venables was li&s;tening&mdash;the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s only gave more animation to my fingers. He went down into the kitchen, and the cook, probably by his de&s;ire, came to me, to know what I would plea&s;e to order for dinner. Mr. Venables came into the parlour again, with apparent carele&s;&s;ne&s;s. I perceived that the cun|ning man was over-reached him&s;elf&mdash;and I gave my directions as u&s;ual, and left the room.</P>
<P>"While I was making &s;ome alteration in my
<PB N="176" REF="035555_0174_1005622108EF0490">
dre&s;s, mr. Venables peeped in, and, begging my pardon for interrupting me, di&s;appeared. I took up &s;ome work (I could not read), and two or three me&s;&s;ages were &s;ent to me, probably for no other purpo&s;e, but to enable mr. Venables to a&s;|certain what I was about.</P>
<P>"I li&s;tened whenever I heard the &s;treet door open; at la&s;t I imagined I could di&s;tingui&s;h mr. Venables' &s;tep, going out. I laid a&s;ide my work&mdash;my heart palpitated; &s;till I was afraid ha&s;tily to enquire; and I waited a long half hour, before I ventured to a&s;k the boy whether his ma&s;ter was in the counting-hou&s;e?</P>
<P>"Being an&s;wered in the negative, I bade him call me a coach, and collecting a few nece&s;&s;aries ha&s;tily together, with a little parcel of letters and papers which I had collected the preceding even|ing, I hurried into it, de&s;iring the coachman to drive to a di&s;tant part of the town.</P>
<P>"I almo&s;t feared that the coach would break down before I got out of the &s;treet; and when I turned the corner, I &s;eemed to breathe a freer air. I was ready to imagine that I was ri&s;ing above the thick atmo&s;phere of earth; or I felt, as wearied &s;ouls might be &s;uppo&s;ed to feel, on entering ano|ther &s;tate of exi&s;tence.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="035555_0175_100562242DBD7CE8">
"I &s;topped at one or two &s;tands of coaches to elude pur&s;uit, and then drove round the &s;hirts of the town to &s;eek for an ob&s;cure lodging, where I wi&s;hed to remain concealed, till I could avail my|&s;elf of my uncle's protection. I had re&s;olved to a&s;&s;ume my own name immediately, and openly to avow my determination, without any formal vindication, the moment I had found a home, in which I could re&s;t free from the daily alarm of expecting to &s;ee mr. Venables enter.</P>
<P>"I looked at &s;everal lodgings; but finding that I could not, without a reference to &s;ome acquaint|ance, who might inform my tyrant, get admit|tance into a decent apartment&mdash;men have not all this trouble;&mdash;I thought of a woman whom I had a&s;&s;i&s;ted to furni&s;h a little haberda&s;her's &s;hop, and who I knew had a fir&s;t floor to let.</P>
<P>"I went to her, and though I could not per|&s;uade her, that the quarrel between me and mr. Venables would never be made up, &s;till &s;he agreed to conceal me for the pre&s;ent; yet a&s;&s;uring me at the &s;ame time, &s;haking her head, that, when a woman was once married, &s;he mu&s;t bear every thing. Her pale face, on which appeared a thou|&s;and haggard lines and delving wrinkles, produced by what is termed fretting, enforced her remark;
<PB N="178" REF="035555_0176_100562263B4ABDD0">
and I had afterwards an opportunity of ob&s;erving the treatment &s;he had to endure, which grizzled her into patience.&mdash;She toiled from morning till night; yet her hu&s;band would rob the till, and take away the money re&s;erved for paying bills; and, returning home drunk, he would beat her if &s;he chanced to offend him, though &s;he had a child at the brea&s;t.</P>
<P>"The&s;e &s;cenes awoke me at night; and, in the morning, I heard her, as u&s;ual, talk to her dear Johnny&mdash;he, for&s;ooth, was her ma&s;ter; no &s;lave in the We&s;t-Indies had one more de&s;potic&mdash;but fortunately &s;he was of the true Ru&s;&s;ian breed of wives.</P>
<P>"My mind, during the few pa&s;t days, &s;eemed, as it were, di&s;engaged from my body; but now the &s;truggle was over, I felt very forcibly the effect which perturbation of &s;pirit produces on a woman in my &s;ituation.</P>
<P>"The apprehen&s;ion of a mi&s;carriage, obliged me to confine my&s;elf to my apartment near a fort|night; but I wrote to my uncle's friend for mo|ney, promi&s;ing 'to call on him, and explain my &s;ituation, when I was well enough to go out&mdash;mean time I earne&s;tly intreated him, not to men|tion

my place of abode to any one, le&s;t my hu&s;|band&mdash;&s;uch the law con&s;idered him&mdash;&s;hould di&s;|turb the mind he could not conquer. I mentioned my intention of &s;etting out for Li&s;bon, the mo|ment my health would permit.'</P>
<P>"The tranquility however, which I was reco|vering, was &s;oon interrupted. My landlady came up to me one day, with eyes &s;wollen with weeping, unable to utter what &s;he was commanded to &s;ay. She declared, 'That &s;he was never &s;o mi&s;erable in her life, that &s;he mu&s;t appear an ungrateful mon&s;ter; and that &s;he would readily go down on her knees to me, to intreat me to forgive her, as &s;he had done to her hu&s;band to &s;pare her the cruel ta&s;k.' Sobs prevented her from proceeding, or an&s;wering my impatient inquiries, to know what &s;he meant.</P>
<P>"When &s;he became a little more compo&s;ed, &s;he took a new&s;paper out of her pocket, declaring, 'that her heart &s;mote her, but what could &s;he do?&mdash;&s;he mu&s;t obey her hu&s;band.'&mdash;I &s;natched the paper from her. An adverti&s;ement quickly met my eye, purporting, that 'Maria Venables had, without any a&s;&s;ignable cau&s;e, ab&s;conded from her hu&s;band; and any per&s;on harbouring her, was menaced with the utmo&s;t &s;everity of the law.'</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="035555_0178_10056229DAE135D8">
"Perfectly acquainted with mr. Venables' meanne&s;s of &s;oul, this &s;tep did not excite my &s;ur|pri&s;e, and &s;carcely my contempt. Re&s;entment in my brea&s;t, never &s;urvived love. I bade the poor woman, in a kind tone, wipe her eyes, and reque&s;t her hu&s;band to come up, and &s;peak to me him&s;elf.</P>
<P>"My manner awed him. He re&s;pected a lady, though not a woman; and began to mutter out an apology.</P>
<P>"Mr. Venables was a rich gentleman; he wi&s;hed to oblige me, but he had &s;uffered enough by the law already, to tremble at the thought; be&s;ides, for certain, we &s;hould come together again, and then even I &s;hould not thank him for being acce&s;&s;ary to keeping us a&s;under.&mdash;A hu&s;|band and wife were, God knows, ju&s;t as one,&mdash;and all would come round at la&s;t.' He uttered a drawling 'Hem!' and then with an arch look, added&mdash;' Ma&s;ter might have had his little frolics&mdash;but&mdash;Lord ble&s;s your heart!&mdash;men would be men, while the world &s;tands.'</P>
<P>"To argue with this privileged fir&s;t-born of rea&s;on, I perceived, would be vain. I therefore only reque&s;ted him to let me remain another day at his hou&s;e, while I &s;ought for a lodging; and
<PB N="181" REF="035555_0179_1005622C77B24148">
not to inform mr. Venables that I had ever been &s;heltered there.</P>
<P>"He con&s;ented, becau&s;e he had not the cou|rage to refu&s;e a per&s;on for whom he had an habi|tual re&s;pect; but I heard the pent-up choler bur&s;t forth in cur&s;es, when he met his wife, who was waiting impatiently at the foot of the &s;tairs, to know what effect my expo&s;tulations would have on him.</P>
<P>"Without wa&s;ting any time in the fruitle&s;s in|dulgence of vexation, I once more &s;et out in &s;earch of an abode in which I could hide my&s;elf for a few weeks.</P>
<P>"Agreeing to pay an exorbitant price, I hired an apartment, without any reference being required relative to my character: indeed a glance at my &s;hape &s;eemed to &s;ay, that my motive for conceal|ment was obvious. Thus was I obliged to &s;hroud my head in infamy.</P>
<P>"To avoid all danger of detection&mdash;I u&s;e the appropriate word, my child, for I was hunted out like a felon&mdash;I determined to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my new lodgings that very evening.</P>
<P>"I did not inform my landlady where I was

going. I knew that &s;he had a &s;incere affection for me, and would willingly have run any ri&s;k to &s;how her gratitude; yet I was fully convinced that a few kind words from Johnny would have found the woman in her, and her dear benefac|tre&s;s, as &s;he termed me in an agony of tears, would have been &s;acrificed, to recompence her tyrant for conde&s;cending to treat her like an equal. He could be kind-hearted, as &s;he expre&s;&s;ed it, when he plea&s;ed, and this thawed &s;ternne&s;s, contra&s;ted with his habitual brutality, was the more accept|able, and could not be purcha&s;ed at too dear a rate.</P>
<P>"The &s;ight of the adverti&s;ement made me de|&s;irous of taking refuge with my uncle, let what would be the con&s;equence; and I repaired in a hackney coach (afraid of meeting &s;ome per&s;on who might chance to know me, had I walked) to the chambers of my uncle's friend.</P>

<P>"BY watching my only vi&s;itor, my uncle's friend, or by &s;ome other means, mr. Venables di&s;covered my re&s;idence, and came to enquire for me. The maid-&s;ervant a&s;&s;ured him there was no &s;uch per&s;on in the hou&s;e. A bu&s;tle en&s;ued&mdash;I caught the alarm&mdash;li&s;tened&mdash;di&s;tingui&s;hed his voice, and immediately locked the door. They &s;uddenly grew &s;till; and I waited near a quarter of an hour before I heard him open the parlour, and mount the &s;tairs with the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e, who ob&s;equiou&s;ly declared that &s;he knew nothing of me.</P>
<P>"Finding my door locked, &s;he reque&s;ted me to 'open it, and prepare to go home with my hu&s;|band, poor gentleman! to whom I had already occa&s;ioned &s;ufficient vexation.' I made no reply. Mr. Venables then, in an a&s;&s;umed tone of &s;oftne&s;s, intreated me, 'to con&s;ider what he &s;uffered, and my own reputation, and get the better of childi&s;h re&s;entment.' He ran on in the &s;ame &s;train, pre|tending

to addre&s;s me, but evidently adapting his di&s;cour&s;e to the capacity of the landlady; who, at every pau&s;e, uttered an exclamation of pity; or 'Yes, to be &s;ure&mdash;very true, &s;ir.'</P>
<P>"Sick of the farce, and perceiving that I could not avoid the hated interview, I opened the door, and he entered. Advancing with ea&s;y a&s;&s;urance to take my hand, I &s;hrunk from his touch with an involuntary &s;tart, as I &s;hould have done from a noi&s;ome reptile, with more di&s;gu&s;t than terror. His conductre&s;s was retiring, to give us, as &s;he &s;aid, an opportunity to accommodate matters. But I bade her come in, or I would go out; and curio&s;ity compelled her to obey me.</P>
<P>"Mr. Venables began to expo&s;tulate; and this woman, proud of his confidence, to &s;econd him. But I calmly &s;ilenced her, in the mid&s;t of a vio|lent harangue, and turning to him, a&s;ked, 'Why he vainly tormented me? declaring that no power on earth &s;hould force me back to his hou&s;e.'</P>
<P>"After a long altercation, the particulars of which it would be to no purpo&s;e to repeat, he left the room, &s;ome time was &s;pent in loud conver|&s;ation in the parlour below, and I di&s;covered that he had brought his friend, an attorney, with him.

The tumult on the landing place, brought out a gentleman, who had recently taken apartments in the hou&s;e; he enquired why I was thus a&s;&s;ailed?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The introduction of Darnford as the deliverer of Maria, in an early &s;tage of the hi&s;tory, is already &s;tated (Chap. III.) to have been an after-thought of the author. This has probably cau&s;ed the imperfect|ne&s;s of the manu&s;cript in the above pa&s;&s;age; though, at the &s;ame time, it mu&s;t be acknowledged to be &s;ome|what uncertain, whether Darnford is the &s;tranger intended in this place. It appears from Chap. XVII, that an interference of a more deci&s;ive nature was de|&s;igned to be attributed to him.</HI> EDITOR.</NOTE> The voluble attorney in&s;tantly repeated the trite tale. The &s;tranger returned to me, ob&s;erving, with the mo&s;t &s;oothing politene&s;s and manly intere&s;t, 'that my countenance told a very different &s;tory.' He added, 'that I &s;hould not be in&s;ulted, or forced out of the hou&s;e, by any body.'</P>
<P>"'Not by her hu&s;band?' a&s;ked the attorney.</P>
<P>"'No, &s;ir, not by her hu&s;band.' Mr. Vena|bles

advanced towards him&mdash;But there was a de|ci&s;ion in his attitude, that &s;o well &s;econded that of his voice, They left the hou&s;e: at the &s;ame time prote&s;ting, that any one that &s;hould dare to protect me, &s;hould be pro&s;ecuted with the utmo&s;t rigour.</P>
<P>"They were &s;carcely out of the hou&s;e, when my landlady came up to me again, and begged my pardon in a very different tone.&mdash;For, though mr. Venables had bid her, at her peril, harbour me, he had not attended, I found, to her broad hints, to di&s;charge the lodging. I in&s;tantly pro|mi&s;ed to pay her, and make her a pre&s;ent to com|pen&s;ate for my abrupt departure, if &s;he would procure me another lodging, at a &s;ufficient di&s;|tance; and &s;he, in return, repeating mr. Vena|bles' plau&s;ible tale, I rai&s;ed her indignation, and excited her &s;ympathy, by telling her briefly the truth.</P>
<P>"She expre&s;&s;ed her commi&s;eration with &s;uch hone&s;t warth, that I felt &s;oothed; for I have none of that fa&s;tidious &s;en&s;itivene&s;s, which a vul|gar accent or ge&s;ture can alarm to the di&s;regard of real kindne&s;s. I was ever glad to perceive in others the humane feelings I delighted to exer|ci&s;e;
<PB N="188" REF="035555_0186_1005623B0CD5EF38">
and the recollection of &s;ome ridiculous cha|racteri&s;tic circum&s;tances, which have occurred in a moment of emotion, has convul&s;ed me with laughter, though at the in&s;tant I &s;hould have thought it &s;acrilegious to have &s;miled. Your im|provement, my deare&s;t girl, being ever pre&s;ent to me while I write, I note the&s;e feelings, becau&s;e women, more accu&s;tomed to ob&s;erve manners than actions, are too much alive to ridicule. So much &s;o, that their boa&s;ted &s;en&s;ibility is often &s;tifled by fal&s;e delicacy. True &s;en&s;ibility, the &s;en&s;ibility which is the auxiliary of virtue, and the &s;oul of genius, is in &s;ociety &s;o occupied with the feelings of others, as &s;carcely to regard its own &s;en&s;ations. With what reverence have I looked up at my un|cle, the dear parent of my mind! when I have &s;een the &s;en&s;e of his own &s;ufferings, of mind and body, ab&s;orbed in a de&s;ire to comfort tho&s;e, who&s;e misfortunes were comparatively trivial. He would have been a&s;hamed of being as in|dulgent to him&s;elf, as he was to others. 'Ge|nuine fortitude,' he would a&s;&s;ert, 'con&s;i&s;ted in governing our own emotions, and making allow|ances for the weakne&s;&s;es in our friends, that we would not tolerate in our&s;elves.' But where is my fond regret leading me!</P>
<P>"'Women mu&s;t be &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive,' &s;aid my land|lady.

'Indeed what could mo&s;t women do? Who had they to maintain them but their hu&s;|bands? Every woman, and e&s;pecially a lady, could not go through rough and &s;mooth, as &s;he had done, to earn a little bread.'</P>
<P>"She was in a talking mood, and proceeded to inform me how &s;he had been u&s;ed in the world. 'She knew what it was to have a bad hu&s;band, or &s;he did not know who &s;hould.' I perceived that &s;he would be very much mortified, were I not to attend to her tale, and I did not attempt to interrupt her, though I wi&s;hed, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, to go out in &s;earch of a new abode for me; where I could once more hide my head.</P>
<P>"She began by telling me, 'That &s;he had &s;aved a little money in &s;ervice; and was overper|&s;uaded (we mu&s;t all be in love once in our lives) to marry a likely man, a footman in the family, not worth a groat. My plan' &s;he continued, 'was to take a hou&s;e, and let out lodgings; and all went on well, till my hu&s;band got acquainted with an impudent &s;lut, who cho&s;e to live on other people's means, and then all went to rack and ruin. He ran in debt to buy her fine clothes, &s;uch clothes as I never thought of wearing my&s;elf, and&mdash;would you believe it?&mdash;he &s;igned an execu|tion

on my very goods, bought with the money I worked &s;o hard to get; and they came and took my bed from under me, before I heard a word of the matter. Aye, madam, the&s;e are misfortunes that you gentlefolks know nothing of;&mdash;but &s;or|row is &s;orrow, let it come which way it will.</P>
<P>"'I &s;ought for a &s;ervice again&mdash;very hard, after having a hou&s;e of my own, but he u&s;ed to follow me, and kick up &s;uch a riot when he was drunk, that I could not keep a place; nay, he even &s;tole my clothes, and pawned them; and when I went to the pawnbroker's, and offered to take my oath that they were not bought with a farthing of his money, they &s;aid, 'It was all as one, my hu&s;band had a right to whatever I had.'</P>
<P>"'At la&s;t he li&s;ted for a &s;oldier, and I took a hou&s;e, making an agreement to pay for the furni|ture by degrees, and I almo&s;t &s;tarved my&s;elf, till I once more got before-hand in the world.</P>
<P>"'After an ab&s;ence of &s;ix years (God forgive me! I thought he was dead) my hu&s;band return|ed; found me out, and came with &s;uch a penitent face, I forgave him, and clothed him from head to foot. But he had not been a week in the hou&s;e, before &s;ome of his creditors arre&s;ted him; and,
<PB N="191" REF="035555_0189_1005626E4E5BC418">
he &s;elling my goods, I found my&s;elf once more reduced to beggary; for I was not as well able to work, go to bed late, and ri&s;e early, as when I quitted &s;ervice; and then I thought it hard enough. He was &s;oon tired of me, when there was nothing more to be had, and left me again.</P>
<P>"'I will not tell you how I was buffeted about, till, hearing for certain that he had died in an ho&s;pital abroad, I once more returned to my old occupation; but have not yet been able to get my head above water; &s;o, madam, you mu&s;t not be angry if I am afraid to run any ri&s;k, when I know &s;o well, that women have always the wor&s;t of it, when law is to decide.'</P>
<P>"After uttering a few more complaints, I pre|vailed on my landlady to go out in que&s;t of a lodging; and to be more &s;ecure, I conde&s;cended to the mean &s;hift of changing my name.</P>
<P>"But why &s;hould I dwell on &s;imilar incidents!&mdash;I was hunted, like an infected bea&s;t, from three different apartments, and &s;hould not have been allowed to re&s;t in any, had not mr. Venables, in|formed of my uncle's dangerous &s;tate of health, been in&s;pired with the fear of hurrying me out of the world as I advanced in my pregnancy, by

thus tormenting and obliging me to take &s;udden journies to avoid him; and then his &s;peculations on my uncle's fortune would prove abortive.</P>
<P>"One day when he had pur&s;ued me to an inn, I fainted, hurrying from him; and, falling down, the &s;ight of my blood alarmed him, and obtained a re&s;pite for me. It is &s;trange that he &s;hould have retained any hope, after ob&s;erving my un|wavering determination; but, from the mildne&s;s of my behaviour, when I found all my endeavours to change his di&s;po&s;ition unavailing, he formed an erroneous opinion of my character, imagining that were we once more together, I &s;hould part with the money he could not legally force from me with the &s;ame facility as formerly. My forbear|ance and occa&s;ional &s;ympathy he had mi&s;taken for weakne&s;s of character; and, becau&s;e he perceived that I di&s;liked re&s;i&s;tance, he thought my indul|gence and compa&s;&s;ion mere &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and never di&s;covered that the fear of being unju&s;t, or of un|nece&s;&s;arily wounding the feelings of another, was much more painful to me than any thing I could have to endure my&s;elf. Perhaps it was pride which made me imagine, that I could bear what I dreaded to inflict; and that it was often ea&s;ier to &s;uffer, than to &s;ee the &s;ufferings of others.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="035555_0191_10056273581632E0">
"I forgot to mention that, during this per&s;e|cution, I received a letter from my uncle, inform|ing me, 'that he only found relief from continual change of air; and that he intended to return when the &s;pring was a little more advanced (it was now the middle of February), and then we would plan a journey to Italy, leaving the fogs and cares of England far behind.' He approved of my conduct, promi&s;ed to adopt my child, and &s;eemed to have no doubt of obliging mr. Vena|bles to hear rea&s;on. He wrote to his friend, by the &s;ame po&s;t, de&s;iring him to call on mr. Vena|bles in his name; and, in con&s;equence of the re|mon&s;trances he dictated, I was permitted to lie-in tranquilly.</P>
<P>"The two or three weeks previous I had been allowed to re&s;t in peace; but &s;o accu&s;tomed was I to pur&s;uit and alarm, that I &s;eldom clo&s;ed my eyes without being haunted by mr. Venables' image, who &s;eemed to a&s;&s;ume terrific or hateful forms to torment me, wherever I turned. Some|times a wild cat, a roaring bull, or hideous a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;in, whom I vainly attempted to fly; at others he was a daemon, hurrying me to the brink of a pre|cipice, plunging me into dark waves, or horrid gulfs; and I woke, in violent fits of trembling anxiety, to a&s;&s;ure my&s;elf that it was all a dream,
<PB N="194" REF="035555_0192_10056274DD5E1CB8">
and to endeavour to lure my waking thoughts to wander to the delightful Italian vales I hoped &s;oon to vi&s;it; or to picture &s;ome augu&s;t ruins, where I reclined in fancy on a mouldering column, and e&s;caped, in the contemplation of the heart-en|larging virtues of antiquity, from the turmoil of cares that had depre&s;&s;ed all the daring purpo&s;es of my &s;oul. But I was not long allowed to calm my mind by the exerci&s;e of my imagination; for the third day after your birth, my child, I was &s;ur|prized by a vi&s;it from my elder brother; who came in the mo&s;t abrupt manner, to inform me of the death of my uncle. He had left the greater part of his fortune to my child, appointing me its guardian; in &s;hort, every &s;tep was taken to enable me to be mi&s;tre&s;s of his fortune, without putting any part of it in mr. Venables' power. My bro|ther came to vent his rage on me, for having, as he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, 'deprived him, my uncle's elde&s;t nephew, of his inheritance;' though my uncle's property, the fruit of his own exertion, being all in the funds, or on landed &s;ecurities, there was not a &s;hadow of ju&s;tice in the charge.</P>
<P>"As I &s;incerely loved my uncle, this intelli|gence brought on a fever, which I &s;truggled to conquer with all the energy of my mind; for, in my de&s;olate &s;tate, I had it very much at heart to

&s;uckle you, my poor babe. You &s;eemed my only tie to life, a cherub, to whom I wi&s;hed to be a father, as well as a mother; and the double duty appeared to me to produce a proportionate increa&s;e of affection. But the plea&s;ure I felt, while &s;u&s;|taining you, &s;natched from the wreck of hope, was cruelly damped by melancholy reflections on my widowed &s;tate&mdash;widowed by the death of my uncle. Of mr. Venables I thought not, even when I thought of the felicity of loving your father, and how a mother's plea&s;ure might be ex|alted, and her care &s;oftened by a hu&s;band's ten|derne&s;s.&mdash;'Ought to be!' I exclaimed; and I en|deavoured to drive away the tenderne&s;s that &s;uf|focated me; but my &s;pirits were weak, and the unbidden tears would flow. 'Why was I,' I would a&s;k thee, but though did&s;t not heed me,&mdash;'cut off from the participation of the &s;weete&s;t plea&s;ure of life?' I imagined with what extacy, after the pains of child-bed, I &s;hould have pre|&s;ented my little &s;tranger, whom I had &s;o long wi&s;hed to view, to a re&s;pectable father, and with what maternal fondne&s;s I &s;hould have pre&s;&s;ed them both to my heart!&mdash;Now I ki&s;&s;ed her with le&s;s delight, though with the mo&s;t endearing compa&s;|&s;ion, poor helple&s;s one! when I perceived a &s;light re&s;emblance of him, to whom &s;he owed her ex|i&s;tence; or, if any ge&s;ture reminded me of him,
<PB N="196" REF="035555_0194_1005627933A4A848">
even in his be&s;t days, my heart heaved, and I pre&s;&s;ed the innocent to my bo&s;om, as if to purify it&mdash;yes, I blu&s;hed to think that its purity had been &s;ullied, by allowing &s;uch a man to be its father.</P>
<P>"After my recovery, I began to think of tak|ing a hou&s;e in the country, or of making an ex|cur&s;ion on the continent, to avoid mr. Venables; and to open my heart to new plea&s;ures and affec|tion. The &s;pring was melting into &s;ummer, and you, my little companion, began to &s;mile&mdash;that &s;mile made hope bud out afre&s;h, a&s;&s;uring me the world was not a de&s;ert. Your ge&s;tures were ever pre&s;ent to my fancy; and I dwelt on the joy I &s;hould feel when you would begin to walk and li&s;p.

<P>"AS my mind grew calmer, the vi&s;ions of Italy again returned with their former glow of colouring; and I re&s;olved on quitting the kingdom for a time, in &s;earch of the chearfulne&s;s, that naturally re&s;ults from a change of &s;cene, unle&s;s we carry the barbed arrow with us, and only &s;ee what we feel.</P>
<P>During the period nece&s;&s;ary to prepare for a long ab&s;ence, I &s;ent a &s;upply to pay my father's debts, and &s;ettled my brothers in eligible &s;itua|tions; but my attention was not wholly engro&s;&s;ed by my family, though I do not think it nece&s;&s;ary to enumerate the common exertions of humanity.

<P>"I had thought of remaining in England, till I weaned my child; but this &s;tate of freedom was too peaceful to la&s;t, and I had &s;oon rea&s;on to wi&s;h to ha&s;ten my departure. A friend of mr. Vena|bles, the &s;ame attorney who had accompanied him in &s;everal excur&s;ions to hunt me from my hiding places, waited on me to propo&s;e a reconciliation. On my refu&s;al, he indirectly advi&s;ed me to make over to my hu&s;band&mdash;for hu&s;band he would term him&mdash;the greater part of the property I had at command, menacing me with continual per&s;ecution unle&s;s I complied; and that, as a la&s;t re&s;ort, he would claim the child. I did not, though inti|midated by the la&s;t in&s;inuation, &s;cruple to declare, that I would not allow him to &s;quander the money left to me for far different purpo&s;es, but offered him five hundred pounds, if he would &s;ign a bond not to torment me any more. My maternal anx|iety made me thus appear to waver from my fir&s;t determination, and probably &s;ugge&s;ted to him, or his diabolical agent, the infernal plot, which has &s;ucceeded but too well.</P>

to leave England.

I mu&s;t &s;top, &s;top to repre&s;s a mother's angui&s;h; le&s;t, in bitterne&s;s of &s;oul, I imprecate the wrath of heaven on this tiger, who tore my only comfort from me.</P>
<P>"How long I &s;lept I know not; certainly many hours, for I woke at the clo&s;e of day, in a &s;trange confu&s;ion of thought. I was probably rou&s;ed to recollection by &s;ome one thundering at a huge, unwieldy gate. Attempting to a&s;k where I was, my voice died away, and I tried to rai&s;e it in vain, as I have done in a dream. I looked for my babe with affright; feared that it had fallen out of my lap, while I had &s;o &s;trangely forgotten her; and, &s;uch was the vague intoxication, I can give it no other name, in which I was plunged, I could not recollect when or where I la&s;t &s;aw you; but I &s;ighed, as if my heart wanted room to clear my head.</P>
<P>"The gates opened heavily, and the &s;ullen &s;ound of many locks and bolts drawn back, grated on my very &s;oul, before I was appalled by the
<PB N="202" REF="035555_0200_1005628662381DD8">
creaking of the di&s;mal hinges, as they clo&s;ed after me. The gloomy pile was before me, half in ruins; &s;ome of the aged trees of the avenue were cut down, and left to rot where they fell; and as we approached &s;ome mouldering &s;teps, a mon|&s;trous dog darted forwards to the length of his chain, and barked and growled infernally.</P>
<P>"The door was opened &s;lowly, and a murder|ous vi&s;age peeped out, with a lantern.&mdash;'Hu&s;h!' he uttered, in a threatening tone, and the af|frighted animal &s;tole back to his kennel. The door of the chai&s;e flew back, the &s;tranger put down the lantern, and cla&s;ped his dreadful arms around me. It was certainly the effect of the &s;oporific draught, for, in&s;tead of exerting my &s;trength, I &s;unk without motion, though not without &s;en&s;e, on his &s;houlder, my limbs refu&s;ing to obey my will. I was carried up the &s;teps into a clo&s;e-&s;hut hall. A candle flaring in the &s;ocket, &s;carcely di&s;per&s;ed the darkne&s;s, though it di&s;|played to me the ferocious countenance of the wretch who held me.</P>
<P>"He mounted a wide &s;tair ca&s;e. Large figures painted on the wall &s;eemed to &s;tare on me, and glaring eyes to meet me at every turn. Entering a long gallery, a di&s;mal &s;hriek made me &s;pring out of my conductor's arms, with I know not
<PB N="165" REF="035555_0201_1005628898BA69F0">
what my&s;terious emotion of terror; but I fell on the floor, unable to &s;u&s;tain my&s;elf.</P>
<P>"A &s;trange-looking female &s;tarted out of one of the rece&s;&s;es, and ob&s;erved me with more curi|o&s;ity than intere&s;t; till, &s;ternly bid retire, &s;he flitted back like a &s;hadow. Other faces, &s;trongly marked, or di&s;torted, peeped through the half|opened doors, and I heard &s;ome incoherent &s;ounds. I had no di&s;tinct idea where I could be&mdash;I looked on all &s;ides, and almo&s;t doubted whether I was alive or dead.</P>
<P>"Thrown on a bed, I immediately &s;unk into in&s;en&s;ibility again; and next day gradually reco|vering the u&s;e of rea&s;on, I began, &s;tarting af|frighted from the conviction, to di&s;cover where I was confined&mdash;I in&s;i&s;ted on &s;eeing the ma&s;ter of the man&s;ion&mdash;I &s;aw him&mdash;and perceived that I was buried alive.</P>
<P>"Such, my child, are the events of thy mo|ther's life to this dreadful moment&mdash;Should &s;he ever e&s;cape from the fangs of her enemies, &s;he will add the &s;ecrets of her pri&s;on-hou&s;e&mdash;and&mdash;</P>

<P>THE performance, with a fragment of which the reader has now been pre&s;ented, was de&s;igned to con|&s;i&s;t of three parts.

<P>DARNFORD returned the memoirs to Maria, with a mo&s;t affectionate letter, in which he rea|&s;oned on "the ab&s;urdity of the laws re&s;pecting matrimony, which, till divorces could be more ea&s;ily obtained, was," he declared, "the mo&s;t in&s;ufferable bondage. Ties of this nature could not bind minds governed by &s;uperior principles; and &s;uch beings were privileged to act above the dictates of laws they had no voice in framing, if they had &s;ufficient &s;trength of mind to endure the natural con&s;equence. In her ca&s;e, to talk of duty was a farce, excepting what was due to her|&s;elf. Delicacy, as well as rea&s;on, forbad her ever to think of returning to her hu&s;band: was &s;he then to re&s;train her charming &s;en&s;ibility through mere prejudice? The&s;e arguments were not ab|&s;olutely impartial, for he di&s;dained to conceal that, when he appealed to her rea&s;on, he felt that he had &s;ome intere&s;t in her heart.&mdash;The conviction was not more tran&s;porting than &s;acred.&mdash;a thou|&s;and times a day, he a&s;ked him&s;elf how he had merited &s;uch happine&s;s?&mdash;and as often he deter|mined
<PB N="206" REF="035555_0204_1005628F24B3D7F0">
to purify the heart &s;he deigned to inhabit.&mdash;He intreated to be again admitted to her pre|&s;ence."</P>
<P>He was; and the tear which gli&s;tened in his eye, when he re&s;pectfully pre&s;&s;ed her to his bo&s;om, rendered him peculiarly dear to the unfortunate mother. Grief had &s;tilled the tran&s;ports of love, only to render their mutual tenderne&s;s more touching. In former interviews, Darnford had contrived, by a hundred little pretexts, to &s;it near her, to take her hand, or to meet her eyes&mdash;now it was all &s;oothing affection, and e&s;teem &s;eemed to have rivalled love. He adverted to her narra|tive, and &s;poke with warmth of the oppre&s;&s;ion &s;he had endured.&mdash;His eyes, glowing with a lambent flame, told her how much he wi&s;hed to re&s;tore her to liberty and love; but he ki&s;&s;ed her hand, as if it had been that of a &s;aint; and &s;poke of the lo&s;s of her child, as if it had been his own. What could have been more flattering to Maria?&mdash;Every in&s;tance of &s;elf-denial was regi&s;tered in her heart, and &s;he loved him, for loving her too well to give way to the tran&s;ports of pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>They met again and again; and Darnford de|clared, while pa&s;&s;ion &s;uffu&s;ed his cheeks, that he never before knew what it was to love.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="035555_0205_10056292AD78ABB8">
One morning Jemima informed Maria, that her ma&s;ter intended to wait on her, and &s;peak to her without witne&s;&s;es. He came, and brought a letter with him, pretending that he was ignorant of its contents, though he in&s;i&s;ted on having it returned to him. It was from the attorney already mentioned, who informed her of the death of her child, and hinted, "that &s;he could not now have a legitimate heir, and that, would &s;he make over the half of her fortune during life, &s;he &s;hould be conveyed to Dover, and permitted to pur&s;ue her plan of travelling."</P>
<P>Maria an&s;wered with warmth, "That &s;he had no terms to make with the murderer of her babe, nor would &s;he purcha&s;e liberty at the price of her own re&s;pect."</P>
<P>She began to expo&s;tulate with her jailor; but he &s;ternly bid her "Be &s;ilent&mdash;he had not gone &s;o far, not to go further."</P>
<P>Darnford came in the evening. Jemima was obliged to be ab&s;ent, and &s;he, as u&s;ual, locked the door on them, to prevent interruption or di&s;|covery. The lovers were, at fir&s;t, embarra&s;&s;ed; but fell in&s;en&s;ibly into confidential di&s;cour&s;e. Darnford repre&s;ented, "that they might &s;oon be
<PB N="208" REF="035555_0206_10056294FAE5B2A0">
parted," and wi&s;hed her "to put it out of the power of fate to &s;eparate them."</P>
<P>As her hu&s;band &s;he now received him, and he &s;olemnly pledged him&s;elf as her protector&mdash;and eternal friend.&mdash;</P>
<P>There was one peculiarity in Maria's mind: &s;he was more anxious not to deceive, than to guard again&s;t deception; and had rather tru&s;t without &s;ufficient rea&s;on, than be for ever the prey of doubt. Be&s;ides, what are we, when the mind has, from reflection, a certain kind of ele|vation, which exalts the contemplation above the little concerns of prudence! We &s;ee what we wi&s;h, and make a world of our own&mdash;and though reality may &s;ometimes open a door to mi&s;ery, yet the moments of happine&s;s procured by the imagination, may, without a paradox, be reckoned among the &s;olid comforts of life.&mdash;Maria now, imagining that &s;he had found a being of cele&s;tial mould&mdash;was happy&mdash;nor was &s;he deceived.&mdash;He was then pla&s;tic in her impa&s;&s;ioned hand&mdash;and reflected all the &s;entiments which animated and warmed her.</P>

<P>ONE morning confu&s;ion &s;eemed to reign in the hou&s;e, and Jemima came in terror, to inform Maria, "that her ma&s;ter had left it, with a de|termination, &s;he was a&s;&s;ured (and too many cir|cu&s;tances corroborated the opinion, to leave a doubt of its truth) of never returning. I am prepared then," &s;aid Jemima, "to accompany you in your flight."</P>
<P>Maria &s;tarted up, her eyes darting towards the door, as if afraid that &s;ome one &s;hould fa&s;ten it on her for ever.</P>
<P>Jemima continued, "I have perhaps no right to expect the performance of your promi&s;e;&mdash;but on you it depends to reconcile me with the human race."</P>
<P>"But, Darnford!"&mdash;exclaimed Maria, mourn|fully&mdash;&s;itting down again, and cro&s;&s;ing her arms&mdash;"I have no child to go to, and Liberty has lo&s;t its &s;weets."</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="035555_0208_100562971C2FB6A8">
"I am much mi&s;taken, if Darnford is not the cau&s;e of my ma&s;ter's &s;light&mdash;his keepers a&s;&s;ure me, that they have promi&s;ed to confine him two days longer, and then he will be free; you cannot &s;ee him&mdash;but they will give a letter to him the mo|ment he is free.&mdash;In that inform him where he may find you in London; fix on &s;ome hotel. Give me your clothes; I will &s;end them out of the hou&s;e with mine, and we will &s;lip out at the garden|gate. Write your letter while I make the&s;e ar|rangements, but lo&s;e no time!"</P>
<P>"In an agitation of &s;pirit, not to be calmed, Maria began to write to Darnford. She called him by the &s;acred name of "hu&s;band," and bade him "ha&s;ten to her, to &s;hare her fortune, or &s;he would return to him."&mdash;An hotel in the Adel|phi was the place of rendezvous.</P>
<P>"The letter was &s;ealed and given in charge; and with light foot&s;teps, yet terrified at the &s;ound of them, &s;he de&s;cended, &s;carcely breathing, and with an indi&s;tinct fear that &s;he &s;hould never get out at the garden-gate. Jemima went fir&s;t.</P>
<P>A being with a vi&s;age that would have &s;uited one po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a devil, cro&s;&s;ed the path, and &s;eized Maria by the arm. Maria had no fear but
<PB N="211" REF="035555_0209_1005565C39C14740">
of being detained&mdash;"Who are you what are? you?" for the form was &s;carcely human. "If you are made of fle&s;h and blood,"&mdash;his gha&s;tly eyes glared on her&mdash;"do not &s;top me!"</P>
<P>"Woman," interrupted a &s;epulchral voice, "what have I to do with thee?"&mdash;Still he gra&s;ped her hand, muttering a cur&s;e.</P>
<P>"No, no; &s;he exclaimed, "this is a moment of life and death!"</P>
<P>With &s;upernatural force &s;he broke from him, and throwing her arms round Jemima, cried, "Save me!" The being, from who&s;e gra&s;p &s;he had loo&s;ed her&s;elf, took up a &s;tone as they opened the door, and with a kind of helli&s;h &s;port threw it after them. They were out of his reach.</P>
<P>When Maria arrived in town, &s;he drove to the hotel already fixed on. But &s;he could not &s;it &s;till&mdash;her child was ever before her; and all that had pa&s;&s;ed during her confinement, appeared to be a dream. She went to the hou&s;e in the &s;uburbs, where, as &s;he now di&s;covered, her babe had been &s;ent. The moment &s;he entered, her heart grew &s;ick; but &s;he wondered not that it had proved its grave. She made the nece&s;&s;ary enquiries, and
<PB N="212" REF="035555_0210_1005624033ADF718">
the church-yard was pointed out, in which it re&s;ted under a turf. A little frock which the nur&s;e's child wore (Maria had made it her&s;elf), caught her eye. The nur&s;e was glad to &s;ell it for half-a-guinea, and, re-entering the hackney-coach which waited for her, gazed on it, till &s;he reached her hotel.</P>
<P>She then waited on the attorney who made her uncle's will, and explained to him her &s;ituation. He readily advanced her &s;ome of the money which &s;till remained in his hands, and promi&s;ed to take the whole of the ca&s;e into con&s;ideration. Maria only wi&s;hed to be permitted to remain in quiet&mdash;She found that &s;everal bills, apparently with her &s;ignature, had been pre&s;ented to her agent, nor was &s;he for a moment at a lo&s;s to gue&s;s by whom they had been forged; yet, equally aver&s;e to threaten or intreat, &s;he reque&s;ted her friend (the &s;olicitor) to call on mr. Venables. He was not to be found at home&mdash;but at length his agent, the attorney, offered a conditional promi&s;e to Maria, to leave her in peace, as long as &s;he behaved with propriety, if &s;he would give up the notes. Maria incon&s;iderately con&s;ented&mdash;Darnford was arrived, and &s;he wi&s;hed to be only alive to love; &s;he wi&s;hed to forget the angui&s;h &s;he felt whenever &s;he thought of her child.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="035555_0211_10056241B895FE10">
They took a ready-furni&s;hed lodging together, for &s;he was above di&s;gui&s;e; Jemima in&s;i&s;ted on being con&s;idered as her hou&s;e-keeper, and to re|ceive the co&s;tomary &s;tipend. On no other terms would &s;he remain with her friend.</P>
<P>Darnford was indefatigable in tracing the my&s;|terious circum&s;tances of his confinement. The cau&s;e was &s;imply, that a relation, a very di&s;tant one, to whom he was heir, had died inte&s;tate, leaving a con&s;iderable fortune. On the news of Darnford's arrival [in England, a per&s;on intru&s;ted with the management of the property, and who had the writings in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, determining, by one bold &s;troke, to &s;trip Darnford of the &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion], had planned his confinement; and [as &s;oon as he had taken the mea&s;ures he judged mo&s;t con|ducive to his &s;ubject, this ruffian, together with his in&s;trument,] the keeper of the private mad|hou&s;e, left the kingdom. Darnford, who &s;till pur&s;ued his enquiries, at la&s;t di&s;covered that they had fixed their place of refuge at Paris.</P>
<P>Maria and he determined therefore, with the faithful Jemima, to vi&s;it that metropolis, and ac|cordingly were preparing for the journey, when they were informed that mr. Venables had com|menced an action again&s;t Darnford for &s;eduction
<PB N="214" REF="035555_0212_10056243CB3CADB0">
and adultery. The indignation Maria felt can|not be explained; &s;he repented of the forbearance &s;he had exerci&s;ed in giving up the notes. Darn|ford could not put off his journey without ri&s;king the lo&s;s of his property; Maria therefore furni&s;hed him with money for his expedition; and deter|mined to remain in London till the termination of this affair.</P>
<P>She vi&s;ited &s;ome ladies with whom &s;he had for|merly been intimate, but was refu&s;ed admittance; and at the opera, or Ranelagh, they could not recollect her. Among the&s;e ladies there were &s;ome, not her mo&s;t intimate acquaintance, who were generally &s;uppo&s;ed to avail them&s;elves of the cloak of marriage, to conceal a mode of conduct that would for ever have damned their fame, had they been innocent, &s;educed girls. The&s;e parti|cularly &s;tood aloof.&mdash;Had &s;he remained with her hu&s;band, practi&s;ing in&s;incerity, and neglect|ing her child to manage an intrigue, &s;he would &s;till have been vi&s;ited and re&s;pected. If, in&s;tead of openly living with her lover, &s;he could have conde&s;cended to call into play a thou&s;and arts, which, degrading her own mind, might have al|lowed the people who were not deceived, to pre|tend to be &s;o, &s;he would have been care&s;&s;ed and treated like an honourable woman. "And Bru|tus

<P>With Darnford &s;he did not ta&s;te uninterrupted felicity; there was a volatility in his manner which often di&s;tre&s;&s;ed her; but love gladdened the &s;cene; be&s;ides, he was the mo&s;t tender, &s;ympathi&s;ing creature in the world. A fondne&s;s for the &s;ex often gives an appearance of humanity to the be|haviour of men, who have &s;mall preten&s;ions to the reality; and they &s;eem to love others, when they are only pur&s;uing their own gratification. Darnford appeared ever willing to avail him&s;elf of her ta&s;te and acquirements, while &s;he endea|voured to profit by his deci&s;ion of character, and to eradicate &s;ome of the romantic notions, which had taken root in her mind, while in adver&s;ity &s;he had brooded over vi&s;ions of unattainable bli&s;s.</P>
<P>The real affections of life, when they are al|lowed to bur&s;t forth, are buds pregnant with joy and all the &s;weet emotions of the &s;oul; yet they branch out with wild ea&s;e, unlike the artificial forms of felicity, &s;ketched by an imagination pain|fully alive. The &s;ub&s;tantial happine&s;s, which en|larges
<PB N="216" REF="035555_0214_100562487A342198">
and civilizes the mind, may be compared to the plea&s;ure experienced in roving through na|ture at large, inhaling the &s;weet gale natural to the clime; while the reveries of a feveri&s;h imagi|nation continually &s;port them&s;elves in gardens full of aromatic &s;hrubs, which cloy while they de|light, and weaken the &s;en&s;e of plea&s;ure they gra|tify. The heaven of fancy, below or beyond the &s;tars, in this life, or in tho&s;e ever-&s;miling regions &s;urrounded by the unmarked ocean of futurity, have an in&s;ipid uniformity which palls. Poets have imagined &s;cenes of bli&s;s; but, fencing out &s;orrow, all the extatic emotions of the &s;oul, and even its grandeur, &s;eem to be equally excluded. We doze over the unruffled lake, and long to &s;cale the rocks which fence the happy valley of con|tentment, though &s;erpents hi&s;s in the pathle&s;s de|&s;ert, and danger lurks in the unexplored wilds. Maria found her&s;elf more indulgent as &s;he was happier, and di&s;covered virtues, in characters &s;he had before di&s;regarded, while cha&s;ing the phan|toms of elegance and excellence, which &s;ported in the meteors that exhale in the mar&s;hes of mis|fortune. The heart is often &s;hut by romance again&s;t &s;ocial plea&s;ure; and, fo&s;tering a &s;ickly &s;en&s;ibility, it grows callous to the &s;oft touches of humanity.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="035555_0215_1005624A0370F758">
To part with Darnford was indeed cruel.&mdash;It was to feel mo&s;t painfully alone; but &s;he rejoiced to think, that &s;he &s;hould &s;pare him the care and perplexity of the &s;uit, and meet him again, all his own. Marriage, as at pre&s;ent con&s;tituted, &s;he con&s;idered as leading to immortality&mdash;yet, as the odium of &s;ociety impedes u&s;efulne&s;s, &s;he wi&s;hed to avow her affection to Darnford, by becoming his wife according to e&s;tabli&s;hed rules; not to be confounded with women who act from very dif|ferent motives, though her conduct would be ju&s;t the &s;ame without the ceremony as with it, and her expectations from him not le&s;s firm. The be|ing &s;ummoned to defend her&s;elf from a charge which &s;he was determined to plead guilty to, was &s;till galling, as it rou&s;ed bitter reflections on the &s;ituation of women in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"></P>

<P>SUCH was her &s;tate of mind when the dogs of law were let loo&s;e on her. Maria took the ta&s;k of conducting Darnford's defence upon her&s;elf. She in&s;tructed his coun&s;el to plead guilty to the charge of adultery; but to deny that of &s;eduction.</P>
<P>The coun&s;el for the plaintiff opened the cau&s;e, by ob&s;erving, "that his client had ever been an indulgent hu&s;band, and had borne with &s;everal defects of temper, while he had nothing criminal to lay to the charge of his wife. But that &s;he left his hou&s;e without a&s;&s;igning any cau&s;e.&mdash;He could not a&s;&s;ert that &s;he was then acquainted with the defendant; yet when he was once endeavouring to bring her back to her home, this man put the peace-officers to flight, and took her he knew not whither. After the birth of her child, her conduct was &s;o &s;trange, and a melancholy malady having afflicted one of the family, which delicacy forbade the dwelling one, it was nece&s;&s;ary to confine her. By &s;ome means the defendant enabled her to make her e&s;cape, and they had lived together in de&s;pite
<PB N="219" REF="035555_0217_1005624EDB76D2A0">
of all &s;en&s;e of order and decorum. The adultery was allowed, it was not nece&s;&s;ary to bring any witne&s;&s;es to prove it; but the &s;eduction, though highly probable from the circum&s;tances which he had the honour to &s;tate, could not be &s;o clearly proved. It was of the mo&s;t atrocious kind, as decency was &s;et at defiance, and re&s;pect for repu|tation, which &s;hows internal compunction, utterly di&s;regarded."</P>
<P>A &s;trong &s;en&s;e of inju&s;tice had &s;ilenced every emotion, which a mixture of true and fal&s;e deli|cacy might otherwi&s;e have excited in Maria's bo|&s;om. She only felt in earne&s;t to in&s;i&s;t on the privilege of her nature. The &s;arca&s;ms of &s;ociety, and the condemnation of a mi&s;taken world, were nothing to her, compared with acting contrary to tho&s;e feelings which were the foundation of her principles. [She therefore eagerly put her&s;elf forward, in&s;tead of de&s;iring to be ab&s;ent, on this memorable occa&s;ion.]</P>
<P>Convinced that the &s;ubterfuges of the law were di&s;graceful, &s;he wrote a paper, which &s;he expre&s;&s;ly de&s;ired might be read in court:</P>
<P>"Married when &s;carcely able to di&s;tingui&s;h the nature of the engagement, I yet &s;ubmitted to the
<PB N="220" REF="035555_0218_10056251015E8660">
rigid laws which en&s;lave women, and obeyed the man whom I could no longer love. Whether the duties of the &s;tate are reciprocal, I mean not to di&s;cu&s;s; but I can prove repeated infidelities which I overlooked or pardoned.&mdash;Witne&s;&s;es are not wanting to e&s;tabli&s;h the&s;e facts. I at pre&s;ent maintain the child of a maid-&s;ervant, &s;worn to him, and born after our marriage.&mdash;I am ready to allow, that education and circum&s;tances lead men to think and act with le&s;s delicacy, than the pre|&s;ervation of order in &s;ociety demands from women; but &s;urely I may without pre&s;umption declare, though I could excu&s;e the birth, I could not the de&s;ertion of this unfortunate babe:&mdash;and, while I de&s;pi&s;ed the man, it was not ea&s;y to ve|nerate the hu&s;band. With proper re&s;trictions, however, I revere the in&s;titution which fraternizes the world. I exclaim again&s;t the laws which throw the whole weight of the yoke on the weaker &s;houlders, and force women, when they claim protector&s;hip as mothers, to &s;ign a contract, which renders them dependent on the caprice of the tyrant, whom choice or nece&s;&s;ity has appointed to reign over them. Various are the ca&s;es, in which a woman ought to &s;eparate her&s;elf from her hu&s;band; and mine, I may be allowed em|phatically to in&s;i&s;t, comes under the de&s;cription of the mo&s;t aggravated.</P>

"I will not enlarge on tho&s;e provocations which only the individual can e&s;timate; but will bring forward &s;uch charges only, the truth of which is an in&s;ult upon humanity. In order to promote certain de&s;tructive &s;peculations; mr. Ve|nables prevailed on me to borrow certain &s;ums of a wealthy relation; and, when I refu&s;ed further compliance, he thought of bartering my per&s;on; and not only allowed opportunities to, but urged, a friend from whom he borrowed money, to &s;e|duce me. On the di&s;covery of this act of atro|city, I determined to leave him, and in the mo&s;t decided manner for ever. I con&s;ider all obli|gations as made void by his conduct; and hold, that &s;chi&s;ms which proceed from want of prin|ciples, can never be healed.</P>
<P>"He received a fortune with me to the amount of five thou&s;and pounds. On the death of my uncle, convinced that I could provide for my child, I de&s;troyed the &s;ettlement of that fortune. I re|quired none of my property to be returned to me, nor &s;hall enumerate the &s;ums extorted from me during &s;ix years that we lived together.</P>
<P>"After leaving, what the law con&s;iders as my home, I was hunted like a criminal from place to place, though I contracted no debts, and demanded

no maintenance&mdash;yet, as the laws &s;anction &s;uch proceeding, and make women the property of their hu&s;bands, I forbear to animadvert. After the birth of my daughter, and the death of my uncle, who left a very con&s;iderable property to my&s;elf and child, I was expo&s;ed to new per&s;ecu|tion; and, becau&s;e I had, before arriving at what is termed years of di&s;cretion, pledged my faith, I was treated by the world, as bound for ever to a man who&s;e vices were notorious. Yet what are the vices generally known, to the various mi&s;eries that a woman may be &s;ubject to, which, though deeply felt, eating into the &s;oul, elude de&s;cription, and may be glo&s;&s;ed over! A fal&s;e morality is even e&s;tabli&s;hed, which makes all the virtue of women con&s;i&s;t in cha&s;tity, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and the forgivene&s;s of injuries.</P>
<P>"I pardon my oppre&s;&s;or&mdash;bitterly as I lament the lo&s;s of my child, torn from me in the mo&s;t violent manner. But nature revolts, and my &s;oul &s;ickens at the bare &s;uppo&s;ition, that it could ever be a duty to pretend affection, when &s;eparation is nece&s;&s;ary to prevent my feeling hourly aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>"To force me to give my fortune, I was im|pri&s;oned&mdash;yes; in a private mad-hou&s;e.&mdash;There, in the heart of mi&s;ery, I met the man charged with

&s;educing me. We became attached&mdash;I deemed, and ever &s;hall deem my&s;elf free. The death of my babe di&s;&s;olved the only tie which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted be|tween me and my, what is termed, lawful hu&s;band.</P>
<P>"To this per&s;on, thus encountered, I volun|tarily gave my&s;elf, never con&s;idering my&s;elf as any more bound to tran&s;gre&s;s the laws of moral purity, becau&s;e the will of my hu&s;band might be pleaded in my excu&s;e, than to tran&s;gre&s;s tho&s;e laws to which [the policy of artificial &s;ociety ha&s;] annexed [po&s;itive] puni&s;hments.&mdash;While no command of a hu&s;band can prevent a woman from &s;uffering for certain crimes, &s;he mu&s;t be allowed to con&s;ult her con&s;cience, and regulate her conduct, in &s;ome degree, by her own &s;en&s;e of right. The re&s;pect I owe to my&s;elf, demanded my &s;trict adherence to my determination of never viewing mr. Venables in the light of a hu&s;band, nor could it forbid me from encouraging another. If I am unfortunately united to an unprincipled man, am I for ever to be &s;hut out from fulfilling the duties of a wife and mother?&mdash;I wi&s;h my country to approve of my conduct; but, if laws exi&s;t, made by the &s;trong to oppre&s;s the weak, I appeal to my own &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice, and declare that I will not live with the individual, who has violated every moral obli|gation which binds man to man.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="035555_0222_10056259102A5DE0">
"I prote&s;t equally again&s;t any charge being brought to criminate the man, whom I con&s;ider as my hu&s;band. I was &s;ix-and-twenty when I left mr. Venables' roof; if ever I am to be &s;up|po&s;ed to arrive at an age to direct my own ac|tions, I mu&s;t by that time have arrived at it.&mdash;I acted with deliberation. Mr. Darnford found me a forlorn and oppre&s;&s;ed woman, and pro|mi&s;ed the protection women in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ociety want.&mdash;But the man who now claims me&mdash;was he deprived of my &s;ociety by this con|duct? The que&s;tion is an in&s;ult to common &s;en&s;e, con&s;idering where mr. Darnford met me. Mr. Venables' door was indeed open to me&mdash;nay threats and intreaties were u&s;ed to induce me to return; but why? Was affection or honour the motive?&mdash;I cannot, it is true, dive into the re|ce&s;&s;es of the human heart&mdash;yet I pre&s;ume to a&s;|&s;ert, [borne out as I am by a variety of circum|&s;tances,] that he was merely influenced by the mo&s;t rapacious avarice.</P>
<P>"I claim then a divorce, and the liberty of en|joying, free from mole&s;tation, the fortune left to me by a relation, who was well aware of the character of the man with whom I had to con|tend.&mdash;I appeal to the ju&s;tice and humanity of the jury&mdash;a body of men, who&s;e private judgment
<PB N="225" REF="035555_0223_1005625B677DB5F0">
mu&s;t be allowed to modify laws, that mu&s;t be unju&s;t, becau&s;e definite rules can never apply to indefinite circum&s;tances&mdash;and I deprecate pu|ni&s;hment [upon the man of my choice, freeing him, as I &s;olemnly do, from the charge of &s;e|duction.]</P>
<P>"I did not put my&s;elf into a &s;ituation to ju&s;tify a charge of adultery, till I had, from conviction, &s;haken off the fetters which bound me to mr. Venables.&mdash;While I lived with him, I defy the voice of calumny to fully what is termed the fair fame of woman. Neglected by my hu&s;band, I never encouraged a lover; and pre&s;erved with &s;crupulous care, what is termed my honour, at the expence of my peace, till he, who &s;hould have been its guardian, laid traps to en&s;nare me. From that moment I believed my&s;elf, in the fight of heaven, free&mdash;and no power on earth &s;hall force me to renounce my re&s;olution."</P>
<P>The judge, in &s;umming up the evidence, al|luded to "the fallacy of letting women plead their feelings, as an excu&s;e for the violation of the mar|riage-vow. For his part, he had always deter|mined to oppo&s;e all innovation, and the new|fangled notions which encroached on the good old rules of conduct. We did not want French prin|ciples

in public or private life&mdash;and, if women were allowed to plead their feelings, as an excu&s;e or palliation of infidelity, it was opening a flood|gate for immorality.&mdash;What virtuous woman thought of her feelings?&mdash;It was her duty to love and obey the man cho&s;en by her parents and rela|tions, who were qualified by their experience to judge better for her than &s;he could for her&s;elf. As to the charges brought again&s;t her hu&s;band, they were vague, &s;upported by no witne&s;&s;es, excepting that of impri&s;onment in a private mad-hou&s;e.&mdash;The proofs of an in&s;anity in the family, might render that however a prudent mea&s;ure: and in|deed the conduct of the lady did not appear that of a per&s;on of &s;ane mind. Still &s;uch a mode of proceeding could not be ju&s;tified, and might peahaps entitle the lady [in another court] to a &s;entence of &s;eparation from bed and board, dur|ing the joint-lives of the parties; but he hoped that no Engli&s;hmen would legalize adultery, by enabling the adultere&s;s to enrich her &s;educer. Too many re&s;trictions could not be thrown in the way of divorces, if we wi&s;hed to maintain the &s;anctity of marriage; and though they might bear a little hard on a few, very few individuals, it was evidently for the good of the whole."</P>

<P>She &s;wallowed the laudanum; her &s;oul was calm&mdash;the tempe&s;t had &s;ub&s;ided&mdash;and nothing re|mained but an eager longing to forget her&s;elf&mdash;to fly from the angui&s;h &s;he endured&mdash;to e&s;cape from thought&mdash;from this hell of di&s;appointment.</P>

incidents of her life were in arms, embodied to a&s;&s;ail her, and prevent her &s;inking into the &s;leep of death.&mdash;Her murdered child again appeared to her, mourning for the babe of which &s;he was the tomb.&mdash;'And could it have a nobler?&mdash;Surely it is better to die with me, than to enter on life without a mother's care!&mdash;I cannot live!&mdash;but could I have de&s;erted my child the moment it was born?&mdash;thrown it on the troubled wave of life, without a hand to &s;upport it?'&mdash;She looked up: 'What have I not &s;uffered!&mdash;may I find a fa|ther where I am going!&mdash;Her head turned; a &s;tupor en&s;ued; a faintne&s;s&mdash;'Have a little pa|tience,' &s;aid Maria, holding her &s;wimming head (&s;he thought of her mother), 'this cannot la&s;t long; and what is a little bodily pain to the pangs I have endured?'</P>
<P>A new vi&s;ion &s;wam before her. Jemima &s;eemed to enter&mdash;leading a little creature, that, with tottering foot&s;teps, approached the bed.&mdash;The voice of Jemima &s;ounding as at a di&s;tance, called her; &s;he tried to li&s;ten, to &s;peak, to look!</P>
<P>Behold your child!' exclaimed Jemima.&mdash;Maria &s;tarted off the bed, and fainted.&mdash;Violent vomiting followed.</P>

<P>A few readers perhaps, in looking over the&s;e hints, will wonder how it could have been prac|ticable, without tediou&s;ne&s;s, or remitting in any degree the intere&s;t of the &s;tory, to have filled, from the&s;e &s;light &s;ketches, a number of pages, more con&s;iderable than tho&s;e which have been
