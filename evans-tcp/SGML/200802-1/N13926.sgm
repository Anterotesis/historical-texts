<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>MY dog had made a point on a piece of lee-ground, and led the Curate and me two or three hundred yards over that and &s;ome &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">le adjoining, in a breathle&s;s &s;tate of expectation, on a burning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of September.</P>
<P>It was a fal&s;e point, and our labour was in vain: yet, to do Rover ju&s;tice, (for he is an excellent dog. though I have lo&s;t his pedigree) the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ault was none of his, the birds were gone; for the Curate &s;hewed me the &s;pot where they had lain ba&s;king, at the root of an old hedge.</P>
<P>I &s;topped and cried Hem! The Curate is fatter than me; he wiped the &s;weat from his brow.</P>
<P>There is no &s;tate where one is apter to pau&s;e and look round them, than after &s;uch a di&s;appointment. Nay, it is even &s;o in life. When we have been hurrying on, led by &s;ome warm wi&s;h or other, looking neither to the right hand or to the left&mdash;we &s;hall find of a &s;udden that all our gay hopes are flown; and the only &s;lender con&s;olation that &s;ome friend can give us, is to point where they were once to be &s;ound. And lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> if we are not of that combu&s;ti|ble <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ace, who will rather beat their heads in &s;pite, than wipe their brows with the C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rate, we look round and &s;ay, with the li&s;tle&s;s nau&s;ea of the king of I&s;rael, "All is vanity and vexation of &s;pirit."</P>
<P>I looked round with &s;ome &s;uch grave apothegm in my mind, when I di&s;covered, for the fir&s;t time, a venerable looking pile, to which the inclo&s;ure belonged. An air of melancholy hung about it. There was a languid &s;tillne&s;s in the day, and a &s;ingle crow, that &s;at on an old tree at the &s;ide of the gate, &s;eemed to delight in the echo which its croaking cau&s;ed.</P>
<P>I leaned on my gun and looked; but I had not breath enough to a&s;k the Curate a que&s;tion. I ob&s;erved carving on the bark of &s;ome of the trees: it was indeed the only mark of human art about the place, except that &s;ome branches appeared to have been lopped, to give a view of the ca&s;cade, which was formed by a little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ill at &s;ome di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t at that in&s;tant I &s;aw pa&s;s between the trees, a young lady with a book in her hand. I &s;tood upon a &s;tone to ob&s;erve her; but the Curate &s;at him&s;elf down on the gra&s;s, and leaning his back where I &s;tood, told me, "That was the daughter of a neighbour|ing gentleman of the name of WALTON, whom he had &s;een walk|ing there more than once.</P>
<P>"Some time ago, &s;aid he, one HARLEY lived there, a whim|&s;ical &s;ort of man I am told, but I was not then in the Cure; though, if I had a turn for them things, I might know a good deal of his hi&s;tory, for the greate&s;t part of it is &s;till in my po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion,"</P>
<P>"His hi&s;tory! &s;aid I. "Nay, you may call it what you plea&s;e, &s;aid the Curate; for indeed it is no more a hi&s;tory than it is a &s;ermon. The way I came by it was this&punc; Some time ago, a grave, oddi&s;h kind of man, lived at board in a farme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">'s hou&s;e in

this pari&s;h: The country people called him the The Gho&s;t; and he was known by the &s;louch in his gait, and the length of his &s;tride. I was but little acquainted with him, for he never frequent|ed any of the clubs hereabouts. Yet for all he u&s;ed to walk a-nights, he was as gentle as a lamb at times; for I have &s;een him playing at t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">-totum with the children, on the great &s;tone at the door of our church yard.</P>
<P>"Soon after I was made Curate, he left the pari&s;h, and went no body knows where; and in his room was found a bundle of papers, which was brought to me by his landlord. I began to read them, but I &s;oon grew weary of the ta&s;k; for, be&s;ides that the hand is in|tolerably bad, I could never find the author in one &s;train for two chapters together: and I do not believe there is a &s;ingle &s;yllogi&s;m from beginning to end."</P>
<P>"I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee this medley," &s;aid I. "You &s;hall &s;ee it now, an&s;wered the Curate, for I always take it along with me a-&s;hooting." "How came it &s;o torn?" "It is excellent wadding," &s;aid the curate.&mdash;It was a plea of expediency I was not in condition to an&s;wer; for I had actually in my pocket great part of an edition of one of the German I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">u&s;tri&s;&s;imi, for the very &s;ame purpo&s;e. We exchanged books; and by that means (for the Curate was a &s;trenuous logician) we probably &s;aved both.</P>
<P>When I returned to town, I had lei&s;ure to peru&s;e the acqui&s;ition I had made: I found it a bundle of little epi&s;odes, put together without art, and of no importance on the whole, with &s;omething of nature, and little el&s;e in them. I was a good deal affected with &s;ome very trifling pa&s;&s;ages in it; and had the name of a Marmon|tel, a Rou&s;&s;eau, or a Richard&s;on, been on the title page&mdash;it is odds that I &s;hould have wept: But</P>

<P>THERE is &s;ome ru&s;t about every man at the beginning.&mdash;It is &s;o every where; though in &s;ome nations (among the French, for in&s;tance) the ideas of the inhabitants, from climate, or what other cau&s;e you will, are &s;o vivacious, &s;o eternally on the wing, that they mu&s;t, even in &s;mall &s;ocieties, have a frequent col|li&s;ion; the ru&s;t therefore will wear off &s;ooner&punc; but in Britain, it often goes with a man to his grave; nay, he dares not even pen a <HI>hic jace<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> to &s;peak out for him after his death.</P>
<P>"Let them rub it off by travel," &s;aid the baronet's brother, who was a &s;triking in&s;tance of excellent metal, &s;hamefully ru&s;ted. I had drawn my chair near his. Let me paint the hone&s;t old man: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">is but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ne pa&s;&s;ing &s;entence to pre&s;erve his memory in my mind.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in his u&s;ual attitude, with his elbow re&s;ted on his knee, and his fingers pre&s;&s;ed on his cheek. His face was &s;haded by his hand; yet, 'twas a face that might once have been well account|ed hand&s;ome; its features were manly and &s;triking, and a certain dignity re&s;ided on his eye-brows, which were the large&s;t I remem|ber to have &s;een. His per&s;on was tall and well made; but the in|dolence of his nature had now made it incline to corpulency.</P>
<P>His remarks were few, and made only to his familiar friends; but they were &s;uch as the world might have heard with veneration: and his hone&s;t heart, uncorrupted by its ways, was ever warm in the cau&s;e of virtue and his friends. He is now forgotten and gone! The la&s;t time I was at Silton Hall, I &s;aw his chair &s;tand in its corner by the fire-&s;ide; there was an additional cu&s;hion on it,
<PB N="2" REF="017579_0006_0FA12F07EB150998">
and it was occupied by my young lady's favourite lap dog. I drew near unperceived, and pinched its ear in the bitterne&s;s of my &s;oul; the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">eature howled, and ran to its mi&s;tre&s;s. She did not &s;u&s;pect the author of its misfortune, but &s;he bewailed it in the mo&s;t pathe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ic terms; and ki&s;&s;ing its lips, laid it gently on her lap, and covered it with a cambric handkerchief. I &s;at in my old friend's &s;eat; I heard the roar of mirth and gaiety around me: poor Ben Silton<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> I gave thee a tear then: accept of one cordial drop that falls to thy memory now.</P>
<P>"They &s;hould wear it off by travel."&mdash;Why, it is true, &s;aid I that will go far; but then it will often happen, that in the velocity of a modern tour, and amid&s;t the materials through which it is commonly made, the friction is &s;o violent, that not only the ru&s;t, but the metal too is lo&s;t in the progre&s;s.</P>
<P>Give me leave to correct the expre&s;&s;ion of your metaphor, &s;aid Mr. Silton: It is not always ru&s;t which is acquired by the inactivity of the body on which it preys; &s;uch, perhaps, is the ca&s;e with me, though in deed I was never cleared from my youth; but (taking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in its fir&s;t &s;tage) it is rather an encru&s;tation, which nature has given for purpo&s;es of the greate&s;t wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>You are right, I returned; and &s;ometimes, like &s;ome precious fo&s;&s;ils, there may be hid under it gems of the pure&s;t brilliancy.</P>
<P>Nay, further, continued Mr. Silton, there are two di&s;tinct &s;orts of what we call ba&s;hfulne&s;s; this, the aukwardne&s;s of a booby, which a few &s;teps into the world will convert into the pertne&s;s of a coxcomb; that a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, which the mo&s;t delicate feelings produce, and the mo&s;t exten&s;ive knowledge cannot always re|move.</P>
<P>From the incidents I have already related, I imagi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e it will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e concluded, that Harley was of this la&s;t &s;pecies of ba&s;hful animals; at lea&s;t, if Mr. Silton's principle is ju&s;t, it may be argu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> this &s;ide: for the &s;econd gradation of the fir&s;t mentioned &s;ort&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> cer|tain, he never attained.

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. Of worldly intere&s;ts.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are certain intere&s;ts which the world &s;uppo&s;es every man to have, and which therefore are properly enough term|ed worldly; but the world is apt to make an erroneous e&s;timate: ig|norant of the di&s;po&s;itions which con&s;titute our happine&s;s or misery, they bring to an undi&s;tingui&s;hed &s;cale the means of the one, as connected with power, wealth, or grandeur, and of the other with their contraries. Philo&s;ophers and poets have often prote&s;ted again&s;t this deci&s;ion: but their arguments have been de&s;pi&s;ed as declama|tory, or ridiculed as romantic.</P>
<P>There are never wanting to a young man &s;ome grave and pru|dent friends to &s;et him right in this particular, if he need it: to wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ch hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> ideas as they ri&s;e, and point them to tho&s;e objects which a wi&s;e man &s;hould never forget.</P>
<P>Harley did not want for &s;ome monitors of this fort. He was frequently told of men, who&s;e fortunes enabled them to command all the luxuries of life, who&s;e fortunes were of their own acquire|ment; his envy was endeavoured to be excited by a de&s;cription of their happine&s;s, and his emulation by a recital of the means which had procured it.</P>
<P>Harley was too apt to hear the&s;e lectures with indifference; nay &s;ometimes they got the better of his temper; and as the in&s;tances were not always amiable, provoked, on his part, &s;ome reflections, which I am per&s;uaded his good nature would el&s;e have avoided.</P>
<P>Indeed I have ob&s;erved one ingredient, &s;omewhat nece&s;&s;ary in a man's compo&s;ition towards happine&s;s, which people of feeling woul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> well to learn; a certain re&s;pect for the follies of man|kind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">or there are &s;o many fools whom the opinion of the world en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">itles to regard, whom accident has placed in heights of which they are unworthy, that he who cannot re&s;train his contempt or in|dignation at the &s;igh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, will be too often quarrelling with the di&s;|po&s;al of things, to reli&s;h that &s;hare which is allotted to him&s;elf. I do not mean, however, to in&s;inuate this to have been the ca&s;e with Harley; on the contrary, if we might rely on his own te&s;ti|mony, the conceptions he had of pomp and grandeur, &s;erved to endear the &s;tate which Providence had a&s;&s;igned him.</P>
<P>He lo&s;t his father, the la&s;t &s;urviving of his parents, as I have al|ready related, when he was a boy. The good man, from a fear of offending, as well as a regard to his &s;on, named him a variety of tutors; one con&s;equence of which was, that they &s;eldom met to con&s;ider of their pupil's affairs at all; and that when they did meet, their opinions were &s;o oppo&s;ite, that the only method of con|ciliation po&s;&s;ible, was the mediatory power of a dinner and a bot|tle, which commonly interrupted, not ended, the di&s;pute; and after that interruption cea&s;ed, left the con&s;ulting parties in a con|dition
<PB N="4" REF="017579_0008_0FA12F0A4EBAF730">
not very proper for adju&s;ting it. His education therefore had been but indifferently attended to; and after being taken from a country &s;chool, at which he had been boarded, the young gen|tleman was &s;uffered to be his own ma&s;ter in the &s;ub&s;equent branch|es of literature, with &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the par&s;on of the pari&s;h in languages and philo&s;ophy, and from the exci&s;eman in arithme|tic and book-keeping. One of his tutors indeed, who, in his youth, had been an inhabitant of the Temple, &s;et him to read Coke upon Littleton; a book which is very properly put into the hands of beginners in that &s;cience, as its &s;implicity is accomodated to their under&s;tandings, and its &s;ize to their inclination. He pro|fited but little by the peru&s;al; but it was not without its u&s;e in the family: for his maiden aunt applied it commonly to the laudable purpo&s;e of pre&s;&s;ing her rebellious linens to the folds &s;he had allotted them.</P>
<P>There were particularly two means of increa&s;ing his fortune, which might have occurred to people of le&s;s fore&s;ight than tho&s;e coun&s;ellors we have mentioned. One of the&s;e was the expectation of &s;ucceeding to an old lady, a di&s;tant relation of Harley's, who was known to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a very large &s;um in the &s;tocks: but in this their hopes were di&s;appointed; for the young man was &s;o untoward in his di&s;po&s;ition, that, notwith&s;tanding the in&s;tructions he daily received, his vi&s;its rather tended to al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">nate than gain the good will of his kin&s;woman. He &s;ometimes looked grave when the old lady told the jokes of her youth; he often refu&s;ed to eat when &s;he pre&s;&s;ed him, and was &s;eldom or never provided with can|dy or liquorice when &s;he was &s;eized with a fit of coughing: nay, he had once the rudene&s;s to fall a&s;leep, while &s;he was de&s;cribing the compo&s;ition and virtues of her favourite cholic water. In &s;hort, he accommodated him&s;elf &s;o ill to her humour, that &s;he died, and did not leave him a farthing.</P>
<P>The other method pointed out to him was, an endeavou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> get a lea&s;e of &s;ome crown lands, which lay contiguous to his little pa|ternal e&s;tate. This, it was imagined, might be ea&s;ily enough procured, as the crown did not draw &s;o much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ent as Harley could afford to give, with very con&s;iderable profit to him&s;elf; and the then le&s;&s;ee had rendered him&s;elf &s;o obnoxious to the mini&s;try, by the di&s;po&s;al of his vote at an election, that he could not expect a renewal. This, however, needed &s;ome intere&s;t with the great, which Harley or his father never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>His neighbour, Mr. Walton, having heard of his affair, gener|ou&s;ly offered him his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to accompli&s;h it. He told him that though he had long been a &s;tranger to courtiers, yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e be|lieved, there were &s;ome of them who might pay regard to his re|commendation; and that, if he thought it worth the while to take a London journey upon the bu&s;ine&s;s, he would furni&s;h him with a letter of introduction to a baronet of his acquaintance, who had a great deal to &s;ay with the fir&s;t lord of the trea&s;ury.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="017579_0009_0FA12F0AF868F2D0">
When his friends heard of this offer, they pre&s;&s;ed him with the utmo&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s to accept of it. They did not fail to enumerate the many advantages which a certain degree of &s;pirit and a&s;&s;urance gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">es a man who would make a figure in the world: they repeated their in&s;tances of good fortune in others, a&s;cribed them all to a happy forwardne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition; and made &s;o copious a recital of the di&s;advantages which attend the oppo&s;ite weakne&s;s, that a &s;tranger, who had heard them, would have been led to imagine, that in the Briti&s;h code there was &s;ome di&s;qualifying &s;tatute again&s;t any citizen who &s;hould be convicted of&mdash;mode&s;ty.</P>
<P>Harley, though he had no great reli&s;h for the attempt, yet could not re&s;i&s;t the torrent of motives that a&s;&s;aulted him; and as he needed but little preparation for his journey, a day, not very di&s;|tant, was fixed for his departure.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. The Man of Feeling in love.</HEAD>
<P>THE day before that on which he &s;et out, he went to take leave of Mr. Walton,&mdash;We would conceal nothing;&mdash;there was another per&s;on of the family to whom al&s;o the vi&s;it was intended, on who&s;e account, perhaps, there were &s;ome tenderer feelings in the bo&s;om of Harley, than his gratitude for the friendly notice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that gentleman (though he was &s;eldom deficient in that virtue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in&s;pire. Mr. Walton had a daughter; and &s;uch a daughter! we will attempt &s;ome de&s;cription of her by and by.</P>
<P>Harley's notions of the &s;ublime or beautiful, were not always to be defined, nor indeed &s;uch as the world would always <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> though we could define them. A blu&s;h, a phra&s;e of af|fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> inferior, a tear at a moving tale, were to him like the Ce&s;tus of Cytherea, unequalled in conferring beauty. For all the&s;e Mi&s;s Walton was remarkable; but as the&s;e, like the above|mentioned Ce&s;tus, are perhaps &s;till more powerful, when the fe|male, wearing them, is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome degree of beauty, com|monly &s;o called; &s;o it happened, that, from this cau&s;e, they had more than u&s;ual power in the per&s;on of that young lady.</P>
<P>She was now arrived at that period of life which takes, or is &s;up|po&s;ed to take, from the &s;lippancy of girlhood tho&s;e &s;prightline&s;&s;es which &s;ome good natured old maids oblige the world with at three|&s;core. She had been u&s;hered into life (as that word is u&s;ed in the dialect of St. James's) at &s;eventeen, her father being then in parlia|ment, and living in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">: at &s;eventeen, therefore, &s;he had been an univer&s;al toa&s;t; her health, now &s;he was four and twenty, was only drank by tho&s;e who knew her face at lea&s;t&punc; Her com|plexion was mellowed into a palene&s;s, which certainly took from her beauty&punc; but agreed, at lea&s;t Harley u&s;ed to &s;ay &s;o, with the pen&s;ive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oftne&s;s of her mind. Her eyes were of that gentle hazel|colour
<PB N="6" REF="017579_0010_0FA12F0BABB170A8">
colour which is rather mild than piercing; and, except when they were lighted up by good humour, which was frequently the ca&s;e, were &s;uppo&s;ed by the fine gentlemen to want fire. Her air and manner were elegant in the highe&s;t degree, and were as &s;ure of commanding re&s;pect, as their mi&s;tre&s;s was far from demanding it. Her voice was inexpre&s;&s;ibly &s;oft; it was, according to that incom|parable &s;imile of Otway's,
<Q><L>&mdash;<HI>Like the &s;hepherd's pipe upon the mountains,</HI></L>
<L><HI>When all his little flock's at feed before him.</HI></L></Q>
The effect it had upon Harley he him&s;elf u&s;ed to talk of ridiculou&s;|ly enough, and a&s;cribed powers to it, which few believed, and no|body cared for.</P>
<P>Her conver&s;ation was always chearful, but rarely witty; and without the &s;malle&s;t affectation of learning, had as much &s;enti|ment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it as would have puzzled a Turk, upon his principles of female materiali&s;m, to have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> Her beneficence was unbounded; indeed the natural tenderne&s;s of her heart might have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> by the frigidity of a ca&s;ui&s;t, as detracting from her virtue in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">his re&s;pect; for her humanity was a feeling, not a prin|ciple: but minds like Harley's are not very apt to make this di&s;|tinction, and generally give our virtue credit for all that benevo|lence which is in&s;tinctive in our nature.</P>
<P>As her father had for &s;ome years retired to the country, Harley had frequent opportunities of &s;eeing her. He looked on her for &s;ome time merely with that re&s;pect and admiration which her ap|pearance &s;eemed to demand, and the opinion of others conferred upon her; from his cau&s;e perhaps, and from that extrem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;en&s;i|bility which we have taken frequent notice of, Harley was remark|ably &s;ilent in her pre&s;ence. He heard her &s;entiments with peculiar attention, &s;ometimes with looks very expre&s;&s;ive of approbation; but &s;eldom declared his opinion on the &s;ubject, much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> compliments to the lady on the ju&s;tne&s;s of her remarks.</P>
<P>From this very rea&s;on it was, that Mi&s;s Walton frequently took more particular notice of him than of other vi&s;itors, who, by the laws of precedency, were better entitled to it: it was a mode of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;he had peculiarly &s;tudied, to bring to the line of that Equality, which is ever nece&s;&s;ary for the ea&s;e of our gue&s;ts, tho&s;e who&s;e &s;en&s;ibility had placed them below it.</P>
<P>Harley &s;aw this; for though he was a child in the drama of the world, yet was it not altogether owing to a want of knowledge in his part; on the contrary, the mo&s;t delicate con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of pro|priety often rai&s;ed that blu&s;h which marred the performance of it&punc; this rai&s;ed his e&s;teem &s;omething above what the mo&s;t &s;anguine de&s;|criptions of her goodne&s;s had been able to do; for certain it is, that notwith&s;tanding the laboured definitions which very wi&s;e men have given us of the inherent beauty of virtue, we are always in|clined to think her hand&s;ome&s;t when &s;he conde&s;cends to &s;mile upon our&s;elves.</P>
<P>It would be trite to ob&s;erve the ea&s;y gradation from e&s;teem to
<PB N="7" REF="017579_0011_0FA12F0C6D024B08">
love: in the bo&s;om of Harley there &s;carce needed a tran&s;ition; for there were certain &s;ea&s;ons when his ideas were flu&s;hed to a degree much above their common complexion. In times not credulous of in&s;piration, we &s;hould account for this from &s;ome natural cau&s;e: but we do not mean to account for it at all; it were &s;ufficient to de&s;|cribe its effects; but they were &s;ometimes &s;o ludicrous, as might derogate from the dignity of the &s;en&s;ations which produced them to de&s;cribe, They were treated, indeed, as &s;uch by mo&s;t of Har|ley's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> friends, who often laughed very heartily at the aukward blunders of the real Harley, when the different faculties, which &s;hould have prevented them, were entirely occupied by the ideal. In &s;ome of the&s;e paroxi&s;ms of fancy, Mi&s;s Walton did not fail to be introduced; and the picture which had been drawn amid&s;t the &s;ur|rounding objects of unnoticed levity, was now &s;ingled out to be viewed through the medium of romantic imagination: it was im|proved of cour&s;e, and e&s;teem was a word inexpre&s;&s;ive of the feel|ings it excited.</P>

<P>HE had taken leave of his aunt on the eye of his intended de|parture; but the good lady's affection for her nephew inter|rupted her &s;leep, and early as it was next morning when Harley came down &s;tairs to &s;et out, he found her in the parlour with a tear on her cheek, and her caudle cup in her hand.

<P>Peter &s;tood at the door. We have mentioned this faithful fellow formerly: Harley's father had taken him up an orphan, and &s;aved him from being ca&s;t on the pari&s;h, and he had ever &s;ince remained in the &s;ervice of him and of his &s;on. Harley &s;hook him by the hand as he pa&s;&s;ed, &s;miling, as if he had &s;aid, "I will not weep."

<P>In a few hours Harley reached the inn where he propo&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fa&s;ting; but the fulne&s;s of his heart would not &s;uffer him to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a mor&s;el.

his wonted pro&s;pect, his fields, his woods, and his hills: they were lo&s;t in the di&s;tant clouds! He penciled them on the clouds, and bade them farewel with a &s;igh!</P>
<P>He &s;at down on a large &s;tone to take out a little pebble from his &s;hoe, when he &s;aw, at &s;ome di&s;tance, a beggar approaching him. He had on a loo&s;e &s;ort of coat, mended with different-co|loured rags, among&s;t which the blue and the ru&s;&s;et were predomi|nant. He had a &s;hort knotty &s;tick in his hand, and on the top of it was &s;tuck a ram's horn; his knees (though he was no pilgrim) had worn the &s;tuff of his breeches; he wore no &s;hoes, and his &s;tockings had entirely lo&s;t that part of them which &s;hould have co|vered his feet and ancles: in his face, however, was the plump appearance of good-humour; he walked at a good round pace, and a crook-legged dog trotted at his heels.</P>
<P>"Our delicacies, &s;aid Harley to him&s;elf, are fanta&s;tic: they are not in nature! that beggar walks over the &s;harpe&s;t of the&s;e &s;tones barefooted, while I have lo&s;t the mo&s;t delightful dream in the world, from the &s;malle&s;t of them happening to get into my &s;hoe."&mdash;.

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX. He makes a &s;econd expedition to the Baronet's. The laudable ambition of a young man to be thought &s;omething by the world.</HEAD>
<P>WE have related, in a former chapter, the little &s;ucce&s;s of his fir&s;t vi&s;it to the great man, for whom he had the intro|ductory letter from Mr. Walton. To people of equal &s;en&s;ibility, the influence of tho&s;e trifles we mentioned on his deportment will not appear &s;urpri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing; but to his friends in the country, they could not be &s;tated, nor would they have allowed them any place in the account.</P>
<P>In &s;ome of their letters, therefore, which he received &s;oon after, they expre&s;&s;ed their &s;urpri&s;e at his not having been more urgent in his application, and again recommended the blu&s;hle&s;s a&s;&s;iduity of &s;uce&s;sful merit.</P>
<P>He re&s;olved to make another attempt at the baronet's; fortified with higher notions of his own dignity, and with le&s;s apprehen&s;ion of a repul&s;e. In his way to Gro&s;venor-&s;quare he began to ruminate on the folly of mankind, who affixed tho&s;e ideas of &s;uperiority to riches, which reduced the minds of men, by nature equal with the more fortunate, to that &s;ort of &s;ervility which he felt in his own. By the time he had reached the Square, and was walking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ong the pavement which led to the baronet's, he had brought his rea&s;oning on the &s;ubject to &s;uch a point, that the conclu&s;ion, by every rule of logic, &s;hould have led him to a thorough indifference in his ap|proaches to a fellow-mortal, whether that fellow-mortal was po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ix or &s;ix thou&s;and pounds a year.</P>
<P>It is probable, however, that the premi&s;es had been improperly formed; for it is certain, that when he approached the great man's door, he felt his heart agitated by an unu&s;ual pul&s;ation.</P>
<P>He had almo&s;t reached it, when he ob&s;erved a young gentleman coming out, dre&s;&s;ed in a white frock, and a red-laced wai&s;tcoat, with a &s;mall &s;witch in his hand, which he &s;eemed to manage with a particular good grace. As he pa&s;&s;ed him on the &s;teps, the &s;tranger very politely made him a bow, which Harley returned, though he could not remember ever having &s;een him before. He a&s;ked him, in the &s;ame civil manner, if he was going to wait on his friend the Barone<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">? "For I was ju&s;t calling, &s;aid he, and am &s;orry to find that he is gone for &s;ome days into the country."</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="017579_0015_0FA12F0F6F15AA48">
Harley thanked him for his information; and was turning from the door, when the other ob&s;erved, that it would be proper to leave his name, and very obligingly knocked for that purpo&s;e. "Here is a gentleman, Tom, who meant to have waited on your ma&s;ter."</P>
<P>"Your name, if your plea&s;e, Sir?" "Harley.&mdash;You'll remem|ber, Tom, Harley.&mdash;The door was &s;hut. "Since we are here, &s;aid he, we &s;hall not lo&s;e our walk, if we add a little to it by a turn or two in Hyde&punc; Park." He accompanied this propo&s;al with a &s;econd bow, and Harley accepted of it by another in return:</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation, as they walked, was brilliant on the &s;ide of his companion. The playhou&s;e, the opera, with every occurrence in high-life, he &s;eemed perfectly ma&s;ter of; and talked of &s;ome reigning beauties of quality, in a manner the mo&s;t feeling in the world. Harley admired the happine&s;s of his vivacity; and, though it was oppo&s;ite to the re&s;ervedne&s;s of his own nature, began to be much plea&s;ed with its effects.</P>
<P>Though I am not of opinion with &s;ome wi&s;e men, that the exi&s;t|ence of objects depends on idea; yet, I am convinced, that their appearance is not a little influenced by it. The optics of &s;ome minds are in &s;o unlucky a per&s;pective, as to throw a certain &s;hade on every picture that is pre&s;ented to them; while tho&s;e of others (of which number wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Harley) like the mirrors of the ladies, have a wonderful effect in bettering their complexions. Through &s;uch a medium perhaps he was looking on his pre&s;ent companion.</P>
<P>When they had fini&s;hed their walk, and were returning by the corner of the Park, they ob&s;erved a board hung out of a window, &s;ignifying, "An excellent ORDINARY Saturdays and Sundays." It happened to be Saturday, and the table was covered for the pur|po&s;e. "What if we &s;hould go in and dine here, if you happen not to be engaged, Sir? &s;aid the young gentleman. It is not im|po&s;&s;ible but we &s;hall meet with &s;ome original or other; it is a &s;ort of humour I like hugely." Harley made no objection; and the &s;tranger &s;hewed him the way into the parlour.</P>
<P>He was placed, by the curte&s;y of his introductor, in an armed chair that &s;tood at one &s;ide of the fire. Over again&s;t him was &s;eat|ed a man of a grave con&s;idering a&s;pect, with that look of &s;ober prudence which indicates what is commonly called a warm man. He wore a pretty large wig, which had once been white, but was now of a browni&s;h yellow; his coat was one of tho&s;e mode&s;t-col|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ured drab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> which mock the injuries of du&s;t and dirt; two jack|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oots concealed, in part, the well-mended knees of an old pair of buck&s;kin breeches, while the &s;potted handkerchief round his neck, pre&s;erved at once its owner from catching cold, and his neck-cloth from being di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tied.</P>
<P>Next him &s;at another man, with a tankard in his hand, and a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uid of tobacco in his cheek, who&s;e eye was rather more vivacious, and who&s;e dre&s;s was &s;omething &s;marter.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t mentioned gentleman took notice, that the room had been &s;o lately wa&s;hed, as not to have had time to dry; and re|marked,
<PB N="12" REF="017579_0016_0FA12F1034B93528">
marked, that wet lodging was unwhole&s;ome for man or bea&s;t. He looked round at the &s;ame time for a poker to &s;tir the fire with, which, he at la&s;t ob&s;erved to the company, the people of the hou&s;e had removed, in order to &s;ave their coals.</P>
<P>This difficulty, however, he overcame, by the help of Harley's &s;tick, &s;aying, "that as they &s;hould, no doubt, pay for their fire in &s;ome &s;hape or other, he faw no rea&s;on why they &s;hould not have the u&s;e of it while they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">at."</P>
<P>The door was now opened for the admi&s;&s;ion of dinner."I don't know how it is with you, gentlemen, &s;aid Harley's new acquaint|ance, but I am afraid I &s;hall not be able to get down a mor&s;el at this horrid mechanical hour of dining." He &s;at down&punc; however, and did not &s;hew any want of appetite by his eating. He took on him the carving of the meat, and critici&s;ing on the goodne&s;s of the pudding.</P>
<P>When the table-cloth was removed, he propo&s;ed calling for &s;ome punch, which was readily agreed to; he &s;eemed at fir&s;t inclined to make i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> him&s;elf, but afterwards changed his mind, and left that province to the waiter, telling him to have it pure We&s;t-India, or he could not ta&s;te a drop of it.</P>
<P>When the punch was brought, he undertook to fill the gla&s;&s;es and call the toa&s;ts.&mdash;"The king."&mdash;That toa&s;t naturally produc|ed politics. It is the privilege of Engli&s;hmen to drink the king's health, and to talk of his conduct. The man who &s;at oppo&s;ite to Harley (who by this time, partly from him&s;elf and partly from his acquaintance on this left hand, was di&s;covered to be a gra|zier) ob&s;erved, "That it was a &s;hame for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> many pen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ioners to be allowed to taken the bread out of the mouth of the poor." "Ay, and provi&s;ions, &s;aid his friend, were never &s;o dear in the memory of man; I wi&s;h the king, and his coun&s;ellors, would look to that." "As for the matter of provi&s;ions, neighbour Wright&s;on, he re|plied, I am &s;ure the prices of cattle&mdash;" A di&s;pute would have pro|bably en&s;ued, but it was prevented by the &s;pruce toa&s;t ma&s;ter, who gave a Sentiment; and turning to the two politicans, "Come, gentlemen, &s;aid he, let us have done with the&s;e mu&s;ty politics, pray now: I would always leave them to the bee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">-&s;uckers in But|cher Row. Come, let us have &s;omething of the fine arts. That was a damn'd hard match betwixt the Nailor and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">im Bucke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. The knowing ones were cur&s;edly taken in there! I lo&s;t a cool hundred my&s;elf, faith."</P>
<P>At mention of the cool hundred, the grazier threw this eyes a&s;lant, with a mingled look of doubt and &s;urpri&s;e; while the man at his elbow looked arch, and gave a &s;hort emphatical &s;ort of cough,</P>
<P>Both &s;eemed to be &s;ilenced, however, by this intelligence, and, while the remainder of the punch la&s;ted, the conver&s;ation was wholly engro&s;&s;ed by the gentleman with the fine wai&s;tcoat, who told a great many "immen&s;e comical &s;tories," and "con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ounded &s;mart things," as he termed them, acted and &s;poken by lords, ladies, and young bucks of quality, of his acquaintance.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="017579_0017_0FA12F10EC4DB0A8">
At la&s;t, the grazier, pulling out a watch, of a very unu&s;ual &s;ize, and telling the hour, &s;aid, that he had an appointment.&punc;"Is it &s;o late? &s;aid the young gentleman; then I am afraid I have mi&s;&s;ed an appointment already: but the truth is, I am cur&s;edly given to mi&s;&s;ing of appointments."</P>
<P>When the grazier and he were gone, Harley turned to the re|maining man of the company, and a&s;ked him, if he knew that young gentleman? "A gentleman! &s;aid he; ay, he is one of your gentlemen at the top of an affidavit. I knew him, &s;ome years ago, in the quality of a foot-man; and, I believe, he had &s;ometimes the honour to be a pimp. At la&s;t, &s;ome of the great folks, to whom he had been &s;erviceable in both capacities, had him made a gauger; in which &s;tation he &s;till remains, and has the a&s;&s;urance to pretend an acquaintance with men of quality. The impudent dog! with a few &s;hillings in his pocket, he will talk you three times as much as my friend Mundy there, who is worth nine thou&s;and, if he's worth a farthing. But I know the ra&s;cal, and de&s;pi&s;e him, as he de&s;erves."</P>
<P>Harley began to de&s;pi&s;e him too, and to conceive &s;ome indig|nation at having &s;at with patience to hear &s;uch a fellow &s;peak non&s;en&s;e. But he corrected him&s;elf, by reflecting, that he was perhaps as well entertained, and in&s;tructed too, by this &s;ame mo|de&s;t gauger, as he &s;hould have been by &s;uch a man as he had thought proper to per&s;onate. And &s;urely the fault may more pro|perly be imputed to that rank where the futility is real, than where it is fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">gned; to that rank, who&s;e opportunities for nobler accompli&s;hments have only &s;erved to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ear a fabric of folly, which the un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">utored hand of affectation, even among the meane&s;t of man|kind, can imitate with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX. He vi&s;its Bedlam.&mdash;The di&s;tre&s;&s;es of a daughter.</HEAD>
<P>OF tho&s;e things called Sights, in London, which it is &s;uppo&s;ed every &s;tranger is de&s;irous to &s;ee, Bedlam is one. To that place, therefore, an acquaintance of Harley's, after having ac|companied him to &s;everal other &s;hews, propo&s;ed a vi&s;it. Harley objected to it, "becau&s;e, &s;aid he, I think it an inhuman practice to expo&s;e the greate&s;t mi&s;ery our nature is afflicted with to evey idle vi&s;itant who can afford a trifling perqui&s;ite to the keeper; e&s;pecially as it is a di&s;tre&s;s which the humane mu&s;t &s;ee with the painful reflection, that it is not in their power to allevia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> it." He was overpowered, however, by the &s;olicitations of his friend, and the other per&s;ons of the party, (among&s;t whom were &s;everal ladies) and they went in a body to Moorfields.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="017579_0018_0FA12F11E442AB48">
Their conductor led them fir&s;t to the di&s;mal man&s;ions of tho&s;e who are in the mo&s;t horrid &s;tate of incurable madne&s;s. The clank|ing of chains, the wildne&s;s of their cries, and the imprecations which &s;ome of them uttered, formed a &s;cene inexpre&s;&s;ibly &s;hocking. Harley and his companions, e&s;pecially the female part of them, begged their guide to return: he &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">emed &s;urpri&s;ed at their unea&s;i|ne&s;s, and was with difficulty prevailed on to leave that part of the hou&s;e without &s;hewing them &s;ome others; who, as he expre&s;&s;ed it in the phra&s;e of tho&s;e who keep wild bea&s;ts for a &s;hew, were much worth &s;eeing than any they had pa&s;&s;ed, being ten times more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">erce and unmangeable.</P>
<P>He led them next to that quarter where tho&s;e re&s;ide, who, as they are not dangerous to them&s;elves or others, enjoy a certain de|gree of freedom, according to the &s;late of their di&s;temper.</P>
<P>Harley had fallen behind his companions, looking at a man, who was making pendulums with bits of thread, and little balls of clay. He had delineated a &s;egment of a circle on the wall with chalk, and marked their different vibrations, by inter&s;ecting it with cro&s;s lines.</P>
<P>A decent-looking man came up, and &s;miling at the maniac, turned to Harley, and told him, that gentleman had once been a very celebrated mathematician. "He fell a &s;acrifice, &s;aid he, to the theory of comets; for, after having, with infinite labour, formed a table on the conjectures of Sir I&s;aac Newton, he was di&s;|appointed in the return of one of tho&s;e luminaries, and was very &s;oon after obliged to be placed here by his friends. If you plea&s;e to follow me, Sir, continued the &s;tranger, I believe I &s;hall be able to give you a more &s;atisfactory account of the unfortunate people you &s;ee here, than the man who attends your companions." Har|ley bowed, and accepted of his offer.</P>
<P>The next per&s;on they came up to had &s;crawled a variety of fig|ures on a piece of &s;late. Harley had the curio&s;ity to take a nearer view of them. They con&s;i&s;ted of different columns, a-top of which were marked South Sea annuities, India &s;tock, and Three per cent. annuities con&s;ol. "This, &s;aid Harley's in&s;tructor, was a gentle|man well known in Change-Alley.</P>
<P>He was once worth fifty thou&s;and pounds, and had actually agreed for the purcha&s;e of an e&s;tate in the we&s;t, in order to realize his mo|ney; but he quarrelled with the proprietor about the repairs of the garden wall, and &s;o returned to town to follow his old trade of &s;tock|jobbing a little longer; when an unlucky fluctuation of &s;tock, in which, he was engaged to an immen&s;e extent, reduced him at once to poverty and to madne&s;s.</P>
<P>Poor wretch! he told me t'other day, that again&s;t the next pay|ment of differences, he &s;hould be &s;ome hundreds above a plum."&mdash;</P>
<P>"It is a &s;pondee, and I will maintain it," interrupted a voice on his left hand. This a&s;&s;ertion was followed by a very rapid re|cital of &s;ome ver&s;es from Home<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. "That figure, &s;aid the gentle|man, who&s;e clothes are &s;o bedaubed with &s;nuff, was a &s;chool-ma&s;|ter of &s;ome reputation: he came here to be re&s;olved of &s;ome doubts
<PB N="15" REF="017579_0019_0FA12F141C5E40B8">
he entertained concerning the genuine pronunciation of the Greek vowels. In his highe&s;t &s;its, he makes frequent mention of one Mr. Bently.</P>
<P>"But delu&s;ive ideas, Sir, are the motives of the greate&s;t part of mankind, and a heated imagination the power by which their ac|tions are incited: the world, in the eye of a philo&s;opher, may be &s;aid to be a large madhou&s;e." "It is true, an&s;wered Harley, the pa&s;&s;ions of men are temporary madne&s;&s;es; and &s;ometimes very fatal in their effects,
<Q><L><HI>From Macedonia's madman to the Swede."</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>"It was indeed, &s;aid the &s;tranger, a very mad thing in Charles, to think of adding &s;o va&s;t a country as Ru&s;&s;ia to his dominions; that would have been fatal indeed; the balance of the North would then have been lo&s;t; but the Sultan and I would never have al|lowed it."&mdash;"Sir!" &s;aid Harley, with no &s;mall &s;urprize on his countenance. "Why yes, an&s;wered the other, the Sultan and I; do you know me? I am the Chan of Tartary."</P>
<P>Harley was a good deal &s;truck by this di&s;covery; he had pru|dence enough, however, to conceal his amazement, and bowing as low to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">march, as his dignity required, left him immedi|ately, and joined his companions.</P>
<P>He found them in a quarter of the hou&s;e &s;et apart for the in&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ne of the other &s;ex, &s;everal of whom had gathered about the female part of the company, and were examining, with rather more ac|curacy than might have been expected, the particulars of their dre&s;s.</P>
<P>Separate from the re&s;t &s;tood one, who&s;e appearance had &s;ome|thing of &s;uperior dignity. Her face, though pale and wa&s;ted, was le&s;s &s;qualid than tho&s;e of the others, and &s;hewed a dejection of that decent kind, which moves our pity unmixed with horror: upon her, therefore, the eyes of all were immediately turned. The keeper, who accompanied them, ob&s;erved it: "This, &s;aid he, is a young lady, who was born to ride in her coach and &s;ix, She was beloved, if the &s;tory I have heard is true, by a young gentle|man, her equal in birth, but by no means her match as to for|tune: but Love, they &s;ay, is blind, and &s;o &s;he fancied him as much as he did her.</P>
<P>Her father, it &s;eems, would not hear of their marriage, and threatened to turn her out of doors, if ever &s;he &s;aw him again. Upon this the young gentleman took a voyage to the We&s;t-Indies, in hopes of bettering his fortune, and obtaining his mi&s;tre&s;s; but he was &s;carcely landed, when he was &s;eized with one of the fevers which are common in tho&s;e i&s;lands, and died in a few days, la|mented by every one that knew him. This news &s;oon reached his mi&s;tre&s;s, who was at the &s;ame time pre&s;&s;ed by her father to marry a rich mi&s;erly fellow, who was old enough to be her grandfather.</P>
<P>The death of her lover had no effect on her inhuman parent; he was only the more earne&s;t for he marriage with the man he had provided for her; and what between her de&s;pair at the death of

<P>Though this &s;tory was told in very plain language, it had par|ticularly attracted Harley's notice: he had given it the tribute of &s;ome tears.</P>
<P>The unfortunate young lady had till now &s;eemed intranced in thought, with her eyes fixed on a little garnet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">g &s;he wore on her finger: &s;he turned them now upon Harley. "My Billy is no more! &s;aid &s;he, do you weep for my Billy? Ble&s;&s;ings on your tears! I would weep too, but my brain is dry; and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> burns, it burns!"&mdash;She drew nearer to Harley.&mdash;"Be comforted, young Lady, &s;aid he, your Billy is in heaven." "Is he indeed? and &s;hall we meet again? And &s;hall that frightful man (pointing to the keeper) not be there?&mdash;Alas!

<P>There was a plaintive wildne&s;s in the air not to be with&s;tood&punc; and except the keepers's, there was not an unmoi&s;tened eye around her.</P>
<P>"Do you weep again? &s;aid &s;he; I would not have you weep: you are like my Billy; you are, believe me; ju&s;t &s;o he looked when he gave me this ring; poor Billy! it was the la&s;t time ever we met!&mdash;</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXI. The Mi&s;anthrope.</HEAD>
<P>THE friend, who had conducted him to Moorfields, called on him again the next evening. After &s;ome talk on the adven|ture of the preceding day; "I carried you ye&s;terday, &s;aid he to Harley, to vi&s;it the mad; let me introduce you to-night, at &s;up|per, to one of the wi&s;e: but you mu&s;t not look for any thing of the Socratic plea&s;antry about him; on the contrary, I warn you, to expect the &s;pirit of a D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ogenes. That you may be &s;omewhat prepared for his extraordinary manner, I will let you into &s;ome par|ticulars of his hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>"He is the elde&s;t of two &s;ons of a gentleman of con&s;iderable e&s;tate in the country. Their father died when they were young: both were remarkable at &s;chool for quickne&s;s of parts, and extent of genius; this one had been bred to no profe&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e his fa|ther's fortune, which de&s;cended to him, was thought &s;ufficient to &s;et him above it; the other was put an apprentice to an eminent attorney.</P>
<P>"In this the expectations of his friends were more con&s;ulted than his own inclination; for both his brother and he had feelings of that warm ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, that could ill brook a &s;tudy &s;o dry as the law, e&s;pecially in that department of it which was allotted to him. But the difference of their tempers made the characteri&s;tical di&s;tinction between them.</P>
<P>"The younger, from the gentlene&s;s of his nature, bore with patience a &s;ituation entirely di&s;cordant to his genius and di&s;po&s;iti|on. At times, indeed, his pride would &s;ugge&s;t, of how little im|portance tho&s;e talents were, which the partiality of his friends had often extolled: they were now incumbrances in a walk of life where the dull and the ignorant pa&s;&s;ed him at every turn; his fan|cy and his feeling, were invincible ob&s;tacles to eminence in a &s;itu|ation, where his fancy had no room for exertion, and his feeling experienced perpetual di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>"But the&s;e murmurings he never &s;uffered to be heard; and that he might not offend the prudence of tho&s;e who had been con|cerned in the choice of his profe&s;&s;ion, he continued to labour in it for &s;everal years, till, by the death of a relation, he fell into an e&s;tate of little better than 100<HI>l,</HI> a year, with which, and the &s;mall patrimony left him by his father, he retired into the country, and made a love-match with a young lady of a temper &s;imilar to his own.</P>
<P>"But his elder brother, whom you are to &s;ee at &s;upper, if you will do us the favour of your company, was naturally impetuous, deci&s;ive, and overbearing. He entered into life with tho&s;e ardent expectations which young men are commonly deluded by: in his friend&s;hips, warm to exce&s;s; and equally violent in his di&s;likes.
<PB N="18" REF="017579_0022_0FA12F162C0D4860">
He was on the brink of marriage with a young lady, when one of tho&s;e friends, for who&s;e honour he would have pawned his life, made an elopement with this very godde&s;s; and left him be&s;ides deeply engaged for &s;ums which his extravagance had &s;quandered.</P>
<P>"The dreams he had formerly enjoyed were now changed for ideas of a very different nature. He abjured all confidence in any thing of human form; &s;old his lands in the country, which &s;till produced him a very large rever&s;ion, came to town, and immured him&s;elf with a woman who had been his nur&s;e, in little better than a garret; and has ever &s;ince applied his talents to the perpe|tual vilifying of his &s;pecies.</P>
<P>"One thing I mu&s;t take the liberty to in&s;truct you in; however different your &s;entiments may be (and different they mu&s;t be) you will &s;uffer him to go on without contradiction; otherwi&s;e he will be &s;ilent immediately, and we &s;hall not be able to get a word from him all the night after."</P>
<P>Harley promi&s;ed to remember this injunction, and accepted the invitation of his friend.</P>
<P>When they arrived at the hou&s;e, they were informed that the gentleman was already come, and had been &s;hewn into the parlour. They found him &s;itting with a daughter of his friend's, about three years old, on his knee, whom he was teaching the alphabet from a horn-book: at a little di&s;tance &s;tood a &s;i&s;ter of hers, &s;ome years older.</P>
<P>"Get you away, Mi&s;s, &s;aid he to this la&s;t, you are a pert go&s;|&s;ip, and I will have nothing to do with you." "Nay, an&s;wered &s;he&punc; Nancy is your favourite; you are quit in love with Nancy." "Take away that girl, &s;aid he to her father, whom he now ob&s;erved to have entered the room, &s;he has woman about her already." The children were accordingly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Betwixt that and &s;upper-time he did not utter a &s;yllable. When &s;upper came, he quarrelled with every di&s;h at table, but eat of them all; only exempting from his cen&s;ures a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">allad, which you have not &s;poiled, &s;aid he, becau&s;e you have not attempted to cook it.</P>
<P>When the wine was &s;et upon the table he took from his pocket a particular &s;moking apparatus, and filled up his pipe, without taking any more notice of Harley, or his friend, than if no &s;uch people had been in the room.</P>
<P>Harley could not help &s;tealing a look of &s;urprize at him; but his friend, who knew his humour, returned it, by annihilating his pre&s;ence in the like manner, and, leaving him to his own medita|tions, addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf entirely to Harley.</P>
<P>In their di&s;cour&s;e &s;ome mention happened to be made of an ami|able character, and the words <HI>honour</HI> and <HI>politene&s;s</HI> were applied to it. Upon this the gentleman, laying down his pipe, and changing the tone of his countenance, from an ironical grin to &s;omething more intently contemptuous: "Honour, &s;aid he, Honour and Politene&s;s! this is the coin of the world, and pa&s;&s;es current with the fools of it.</P>

<P>The philo&s;opher turned his eye upon him: he examined him from top to toe, with a &s;ort triumphant contempt. Harley's coat happened to be a new one; the other's was as &s;habby as could po&s;&s;ibly be &s;uppo&s;ed to be on the back of a gentleman: there was much &s;ignificancy in his look with regard to this coat: it &s;poke of the &s;leekne&s;s of folly, and the thread barene&s;s of wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>"Truth, continued he, the mo&s;t amiable, as well as the mo&s;t natural of virtues, you are at pains to eradicate.

<P>The&s;e are they whom ye term Ingenious; it is a phra&s;e of com|mendation I dete&s;t; it implies an attempt to impo&s;e on my judg|ment, by flattering my imagination: yet the&s;e are they who&s;e works are read by the old with delight, which the young are taught to look on as the codes of knowledge and philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>"Indeed, the education of your youth is every way prepo&s;terous: you wa&s;te at &s;chool years in improving talents, without having ever &s;pent an hour in di&s;covering them; one promi&s;cuous line of in&s;truc|tion is followed, without regard to genius, capacity, or probable &s;ituation in the commonwealth.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXV. His &s;kill in phy&s;iognomy.</HEAD>
<P>THE company at the baronet's removed to the playhou&s;e ac|cordingly, and Harley took his u&s;ual route into the Park. He ob&s;erved, as he entered, a fre&s;h looking elderly gentleman in conver&s;ation with a beggar, who, leaning on his cru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ch, was re|counting the hard&s;hips he had undergone, and explaining the wretchedne&s;s of his pre&s;ent condition.</P>
<P>This was a very intere&s;ting <HI>tete-a-tete</HI> to Harley; he was rude enough therefore to &s;lacken his pace as he approached, and at la&s;t to make a full &s;top at the gentleman's back, who was ju&s;t then ex|pre&s;&s;ing his compa&s;&s;ion for the beggar, and regretting that he had
<PB N="22" REF="017579_0026_0FA12F192E4CB4F8">
not a farthing of change about him. At &s;aying this he looked piteou&s;ly on the fellow: there was &s;omething in his phy&s;iognomy which catched Harley's notice: indeed phy&s;iognomy was one of Harley's foibles, for which he had been often rebuked by his aunt in the country; who u&s;ed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> him, that when he wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> come to her years and experience, he would know that all's not gold that gli&s;ters: and it mu&s;t be owned, that his aunt was a very &s;en&s;ible, har&s;h-looking, maiden lady of three&s;core and upwards.</P>
<P>But he was too apt to forget this caution; and now, it &s;eems, it had not occured to him: &s;tepping up, therefore, to the gentleman, who was lamenting the want of &s;ilver, "Your inten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ons, Sir, &s;aid he, are &s;o good, that I cannot help lending you my a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">ance to carry them into execution." and gave the beggar a &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ing. The other returned a &s;uitable compliment, and extolled the benevolence of Harley. They kept walking together, and benevolence grew the topic of di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;tranger was fluent on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>"There is no u&s;e of money, &s;aid he, equal to that of benefi|cence: with the profu&s;e, it is lo&s;t; and even with tho&s;e who lay it out according to the prudence of the world, the objects acquired by it pall on the &s;en&s;e, and have &s;carce become our own till they lo&s;e their value with the power of plea&s;ing; but here the enjoy|ment grows on reflection, and our money is mo&s;t truly ours, when it cea&s;es being in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>"Yet I agree in &s;ome mea&s;ure, an&s;wered Harley, with tho&s;e who think, that charity to our common beggars is often mi&s;placed: there are objects le&s;s obtru&s;ive who&s;e title is a better one."</P>
<P>"We cannot ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h, &s;aid the &s;tranger; and even of the worthle&s;s, are there not many who&s;e impudence, or who&s;e vice, may have been one dreadful con&s;equence of misfortune?"</P>
<P>Harley looked again in his face, and ble&s;&s;ed him&s;elf for his &s;kill in phy&s;iognomy.</P>
<P>By this time they had reached the end of the walk: the old gentleman leaned on the rails to take breath, and in the mean time they were joined by a younger man, who&s;e figure was much above the appearence of his dre&s;s, which was poor and &s;habby: Harley's former companion addre&s;&s;ed him as an acquaintance, and they turned on the walk together.</P>
<P>The olde&s;t of the &s;trangers complained of the clo&s;ene&s;s of the evening, and a&s;ked the other, if he would go with him into a hou&s;e hard by, and take one draught of excellent cider. "The man who keeps this hou&s;e, &s;aid he to Harley, was once a &s;ervant of mine: I could not think of turning loo&s;e upon the world a faith|ful old fellow, for no other rea&s;on but that his age had incapacitat|ed him; &s;o I give him an annuity of ten pounds, with the help of which he has &s;et up this little place here, and his daughter goes and &s;ells milk in the city, while her father manages his tap-room, as he calls it, at home. I can't well a&s;k a gentleman of your ap|pearance to accompany me to &s;o paltry a place."&mdash;"Sir, replied
<PB N="23" REF="017579_0027_0FA12F19ECA609D8">
Harley, interrupting him, I would much rather enter it than the mo&s;t celebrated tavern in town: to give to the nece&s;&s;itous, may &s;ometimes be a weakne&s;s in the man; to encourage indu&s;try, is a duty in the citizen." They entered the hou&s;e accordingly.</P>
<P>On a table, at the corner of the room, lay a pack of cards, loo&s;e|ly thrown together. The old gentleman reproved the man of the hou&s;e for encouraging &s;o idle an amu&s;ement: Harley attempted to defend him from the nece&s;&s;ity of accommodating him&s;elf to the hu|mour of his gue&s;ts, and taking up the cards, began to &s;huffle them backwards and forwards in his hand. "Nay, I don't think cards &s;o unpardonable an amu&s;ement as &s;ome do, replied the other; and &s;ometimes, about this time of the evening, when my eyes begin to fail me for my book, I divert my&s;elf with a game at piquet, with|out finding my morals a bit relaxed by it. Do you play piquet, Sir&punc;" (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o Harley) Harley an&s;wered in the affirmative; and the other propo&s;ed playing a pool at a &s;hilling the game, doubling the &s;takes: adding, that he never played higher with any body.</P>
<P>Harley's good nature could not refu&s;e this to the benevolent old man; and the younger &s;tranger, though he at fir&s;t pleaded a prior engagement, yet being earne&s;tly &s;olicited by his friend, at la&s;t a|greed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o it.</P>
<P>When they began to play, the old gentleman, &s;omewhat to the &s;urpri&s;e of Harley, produced ten &s;hillings to &s;erve for markers of his &s;core. "He had no change for the beggar, &s;aid Harley to him&s;elf; but I can ea&s;ily account for it: it is curious to ob&s;erve the affection that inanimate things will acquire from us by a long ac|quaintance: if I may judge from my own feelings, the old man would not part with one of the&s;e counters for ten times its intrin&s;ic value; it even got the better of his benevolence! I my&s;elf have a pair of old bra&s;s &s;leeve-buttons&mdash;Here he was interrupted by being told, that the old gentleman had beat the younger, and that it was his turn to take up the conqueror.</P>
<P>"Your game has been &s;hort," &s;aid Harley. "I repiqued him," an&s;wered the old man, with joy &s;parkling in his countenance."</P>
<P>Harley wi&s;hed to be repiqued too, but he was di&s;appointed; for he had the &s;ame good fortune again&s;t his opponent. Indeed never did fortune, mutable as &s;he is, delight in mutability &s;o much as at that moment: the victory was &s;o quick, and &s;o con&s;tantly alternate, that the &s;take, in a &s;hort time, amounted to no le&s;s a &s;um than 12 <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI> Harley's proportion of which was within half a guinea of the money he had in his pocket. He had before propo&s;ed a divi&s;ion, but the old gentleman oppo&s;ed it with &s;uch a plea&s;ant warmth in his manner, that it was always over-ruled.</P>
<P>Now, however, he told them, that he had an appointment with &s;ome gentlemen, and it was within a few minutes of his hour. The young &s;tranger had gained one game, and was engaged in the &s;e|cond with the other: they agreed therefore that the &s;take &s;hould be divided, if the old gentleman won that; which was more than probable, as his &s;core was 90 to 35, and he was elde&s;t hand; but
<PB N="24" REF="017579_0028_0FA12F1AADC5DD70">
a momentous repique decided it in favour of his adver&s;ary, who &s;eemed to enjoy his victory mingled with regret, for having won too much, while his friend, with great ebullience of pa&s;&s;ion, ma|ny prai&s;es of his own good play, and many maledictions on the power of chance, took up the cards, and threw them into the fire.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVI. The Man of Feeling in a brothel.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>company he was engaged to meet were a&s;&s;embled in Fleet-&s;treet. He had walked for &s;ome time along the Strand, amid&s;t the crowd of tho&s;e wretches who wait the uncertain wages of pro&s;titution, with ideas of pity &s;uitable to the &s;cene around him, and the feelings he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and had got as far as Somer&s;et-hou&s;e when one of them laid hold of his arm, and, with a voice tremulous and faint, a&s;ked him for a pint of wine, in a manner more &s;upplicatory than is u&s;ual with tho&s;e whom the infamy of their profe&s;&s;ion has deprived of &s;hame: he turned round at the demand, and looked &s;tedfa&s;tly on the per&s;on who made it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>She was taller than the common &s;ize, and elegantly formed; her face was thin and hollow, and &s;hewed the remains of tarni&s;hed beau|ty. Her eyes were black, but had little of their lu&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">re left: her cheeks had &s;ome paint on it, laid on without art, and productive of no advantage to her complexion, which exhibited on the other parts of her face a deadly palene&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Harley &s;tood in the attitude of he&s;itation; which &s;he interpreting to her advantage, again repeated her reque&s;t, and endeavoured to force a leer of invitation into her countenance. He took her arm, and they walked on to one of tho&s;e ob&s;equious taverns in the neighbourhood, where the dearne&s;s of the wine is a di&s;charge in full for the character of the hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><HI>From what impul&s;e he did this, we do not mean to inquire; as it has ever been again&s;t our nature to &s;earch for motives where bad ones are to be found.&mdash;They entered, and a waiter &s;hewed them a room, and placed a bottle of claret on the table.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Harley filled the lady's gla&s;s; which &s;he had no &s;ooner ta&s;ted, than dropping it on the floor, and eagerly catching his arm, her eye grew fix|ed, her lip a&s;&s;umed a clayey whitene&s;s, and &s;he f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ll back lifele&s;s in her chair.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Harley &s;tarted from his &s;eat, and, catching her in his arms, &s;up|ported her from falling to the ground, looking wildly at the door, as if he wanted to run for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but dur&s;t not leave the mi&s;erable creature alone. It was not till &s;ome minutes after, that it occurred to him to ring the bell, which at la&s;t however he thought of, and rung with repeated violence even after the waiter appeared.

&s;prinkled it on the hands and face of the dying figure before him.

<P><HI>It was ever the priviledge of misfortune to be revered by him.&mdash;"Two days!&mdash;&s;aid he; and I have fared &s;umptuou&s;ly every day!"&mdash;He was reaching to the bell; &s;he under&s;tood his meaning, and pre|vented him.</HI> "I <HI>beg, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, that you would give your&s;elf no more trouble about a wretch who does not wi&s;h to live; but, at pre&s;ent, I could not eat a bit; my &s;tomach even ro&s;e at the la&s;t mouthful of that cru&s;t" He offered to call a chair, &s;aying, that he hoped a little re&s;t would relieve her.&mdash;He had one half guinea left: "I am &s;orry, he &s;aid, that at pre&s;ent I &s;hould be able to make you an offer of no more than this paltry &s;um."

"No more of that, an&s;wered Harley; there is virtue in the&s;e tears; let the fruit of them be virtue."&mdash;He rung, and ordered a chair.&mdash;"Though I am the vile&s;t of beings, &s;aid &s;he, I have not forgotten every virtue; gratitude, I hope, I &s;hall &s;till have left, did</HI> I <HI>but know who this be|nefactor is."&mdash;"My name is Harley"&mdash;"Could I ever have an opportunity"&mdash;"You &s;hall, and a glorious one too! your future con|duct&mdash;but I do not mean to reproach you&mdash;if, I &s;ay&mdash;it will be the noble&s;t reward&mdash;I will do my&s;elf the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you again."&mdash;Here the waiter entered, and told them the chair was at the door; the lady informed Harley of her lodgings, and he promi&s;ed to wait on her at ten next morning.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He led her to the chair, and returned to clear with the waiter, without ever once reflecting that he had no money in his pocket. He was a&s;hamed to make an excu&s;e; yet an excu&s;e mu&s;t be made: he was beginning to frame one, when the waiter cut him &s;hort, by telling him, that he could not run &s;cores; but that, if he would leave his watch, or any other pledge, it would be as &s;afe as if it lay in his pocket. Har|ley jumped at the propo&s;al, and pulling out his watch, delivered it in|to his hands immediately; and having, for once, had the precaution to take a note of the lodging he intended to vi&s;it next morning, &s;allied forth with a flu&s;h of triumph on his face, without taking notice of the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eer of the waiter, who, twirling the watch in his hand, made him a profound bow at the door, and whi&s;pered to a girl, who &s;tood in the pa&s;&s;age, &s;omething, in which the word</HI> CULLY <HI>was honoured with a particular empha&s;is.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVII. His &s;kill in phy&s;iognomy is doubted.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER he had been &s;ome time among&s;t the company with whom he had appointed to meet, and the la&s;t bottle was cal|led for, he fir&s;t recollected that he &s;hould be again at a lo&s;s how to di&s;charge his &s;hare of the reckoning. He applied therefore to one of them, with whom he was mo&s;t intimate, acknowledging that he had not a farthing of money about him; and upon being jocularly a&s;ked the rea&s;on, acquainted them with the two adventures we have ju&s;t now related. One of the company a&s;ked him, If the old man in Hyde-Park did not wear a browni&s;h coat, with a narrow gold|edging, and his companion an old green frock, with a buff colour|ed wai&s;tcoat.</P>
<P>Upon Harley's recollecting that they did; "Then, &s;aid he, you may be thankful you have come off &s;o well; they are two as noted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">harpers, in their way, as any in town, and but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> other night took me in for a much larger &s;um: I had &s;ome thoughts of applying to a ju&s;tice, but one does not like to be &s;een in the&s;e matters."</P>
<P>Harley an&s;wered, "That he could not but fancy the gentleman was mi&s;taken, as he never &s;aw a face promi&s;e more hone&s;ty than the old man's he had met with."&mdash;"His face!" &s;aid a grave|looking man, who &s;at oppo&s;ite to him, &s;quirting the juice of his tob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> obliquely into the grate. There was &s;omething very em|phatical in the action; for it was followed by a bur&s;t of laughter round the table.</P>
<P>"Gentlemen &s;aid Harley, you are di&s;po&s;ed to be merry; it may be as you imagine, for I confe&s;s my&s;elf ignorant of the town: but there is one thing which makes me bear the lo&s;s of my money with temper; the young fellow who won it was certainly mi&s;erably poor; I ob&s;erved him borrow money for the &s;take from his friend; he had di&s;tre&s;s and hunger in his countenance: be his character what it may, his nece&s;&s;ities at lea&s;t may plead for him.&mdash;At this there was a louder laugh than before.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, &s;aid the lawyer, one of who&s;e conver&s;ations with Harley we have already recorded, here's a very pretty fellow for you: to have heard him talk &s;ome nights ago, as I did, you might have &s;worn he was a &s;aint; yet now he games with &s;harpers, and lo&s;es his money; and is bubbled by a fine &s;tory invented by a whore, and pawns his watch; here are &s;anctified doings with a witne&s;s!"</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVIII. He keeps his appointment.</HEAD>
<P>THE la&s;t night's raillery of his companions was recalled to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> remembrance when he awoke, and the colder homilies of prudence began to &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome things which were nowi&s;e favourable for a performance of his promi&s;e to the unfortunate female he had met with before. He ro&s;e uncertain of his purpo&s;e; but the torpor of &s;uch con&s;iderations was &s;eldom prevalent over the warmth of his nature. He walked &s;ome turns backwards and for|wards in his room; he recalled the languid form of the fainting wretch to his mind; he wept at the recollection of her tears.</P>
<P>"Though I am the vile&s;t of beings, I have not forgotten every virtue; gratitude, I hope, I &s;hall &s;till have left."&mdash;</P>
<P>"He took a larger &s;tride&mdash;"Powers of mercy that &s;urround me! cry'd he, do ye not &s;mile upon deeds like the&s;e? to calculate the chances of deception is too tedious a bu&s;ine&s;s for the life of man!"&mdash;The clock &s;truck ten!&mdash;When he was got down &s;tairs, he found that he had forgot the note of her lodgings; he gnawed his lips at the delay: he was fairly on the pavement, when he recollected having left his pur&s;e; he did but ju&s;t prevent him|&s;elf from articulating an imprecation. He ru&s;hed a &s;econd time up into his chamber. "What a wretch I am, &s;aid he; ere this time perhaps&mdash;"It was a perhaps not to be borne:&mdash;two vibrations of a pendulum would have &s;erved him to lock his bureau;&mdash;but they could not be &s;pared.</P>
<P>When he reached the hou&s;e, and inquired for Mi&s;s Atkins, for that was the lady's name, he was &s;hewn up three pair of &s;tairs into a &s;mall room lighted by one narrow lattice, and patched round with &s;hreds of different coloured paper. In the darke&s;t corner &s;tood &s;omething like a bed, before which a tattered coverlet hung by way of curtain. He had not waited long when &s;he appeared. Her face had the gli&s;ter of new-wa&s;hed tears on it.</P>
<P>"I am a&s;hamed, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, that you &s;hould have taken this fre&s;h piece of trouble about one &s;o little worthy of it; but, to the humane, I know there is a plea&s;ure in goodne&s;s for its own &s;ake: if you have patience for the recital of my &s;tory, it may palliate, though it cannot excu&s;e, my faults." Harley bowed, as a &s;ign of a&s;&s;ent; and &s;he began as follows:</P>
<P>"I am the daughter of an officer, whom a &s;ervice of forty years had advanced no higher than to the rank of captain. I have had hints from him&s;elf, and been informed by others, that it was in &s;ome mea&s;ure owing to tho&s;e principles of rigid honour, which it was his boa&s;t to po&s;&s;e&s;s, and which he early inculcated on me, that he had been able to arrive at no better &s;tation, My mother died when I was a child; old enough to grieve for her death, but inca|pable of remembering her precepts of advice.</P>
<P>Though my father was doatingly fond of her, yet there were &s;ome &s;entiments in which they materially differed: She had been
<PB N="28" REF="017579_0032_0FA12F1F359B5F98">
bred from her infancy in the &s;tricte&s;t principles of religion, and took the morality of her conduct from the motives which an ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|rence to the&s;e principles &s;ugge&s;ted. My father, who had been in the army from his youth, affixed an idea of pu&s;illanimity to that virtue, which was formed by the doctrines excited by the rewards, or guarded by the terrors of revelation; his darling idol was the honour of a &s;oldier; a term which he held in &s;uch revere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ce, that he commonly u&s;ed it for his mo&s;t &s;acred a&s;&s;everation.</P>
<P>When my mother died, I was for &s;ome time &s;uffered to continue in tho&s;e &s;entiments which her in&s;tructions had produced; but &s;oon after, though from re&s;pect to her memory, my father did not ab&s;o|lutely ridicule them, yet he &s;hewed, in his di&s;cour&s;e to others, &s;o little regard to them, and, at times, &s;ugge&s;ted to me motives of action &s;o different, that I was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">on weaned from opinions, which I began to look on as the dreams of &s;uper&s;tition, or the artful in|ventions of de&s;igning hypocri&s;y.</P>
<P>My mother's books were left behind at the different quarters we removed to, and my reading was principally confined to plays, no|vels, and tho&s;e poetical de&s;criptions of the beauty of virtue and hon|our, which the circulating libraries ea&s;ily afforded.</P>
<P>"As I was generally reckoned hand&s;ome, and the quickne&s;s of my parts extolled by all our vi&s;itors, my father had a pride in &s;hewing me to the world. I was young, giddy, open to adulation, and vain of tho&s;e talents which acquired it.</P>
<P>"After the la&s;t war, my father was reduced to half-pay; with which we retired to a village in the country, which the acquaint|ance of &s;ome genteel families who re&s;ided in it, and the cheapne&s;s of living, particularly recommended. My father rented a &s;mall hou&s;e, with a piece of ground &s;ufficient to keep a hor&s;e for him, and a cow for the benefit of his family.</P>
<P>"An old man &s;ervant managed his ground; while a maid, who had formerly been my mother's, and had &s;ince been mine, undertook the care of our little dairy: they were a&s;&s;i&s;ted in each of their provinces by my father and me, and we pa&s;&s;ed our time in a &s;tate of tranquillity, which he had always talked of with delight, and my train of reading had taught me to admire.</P>
<P>"Though I had never &s;een the polite circles of the metropolis, the company my father had introduced me into had given me a de|gree of good-breeding, which &s;oon di&s;covered a &s;uperiority over the young ladies of our village. I was quoted as an example of politene&s;s, and my company courted by mo&s;t of the con&s;iderable families in the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>"Among&s;t the hou&s;es where I was frequently invited, was Sir George Winbrook's. He had two daughters nearly of my age, with whom, though they had been bred up in tho&s;e maxims of vul|gar doctrine, which my &s;uperior under&s;tanding could not but de&s;|pi&s;e, yet as their good nature led them to an imitation of my man|ners in every thing el&s;e, I cultivated a particular friend&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="017579_0033_0FA12F1FED6FFD10">
"Some months after our fir&s;t acquaintance, Sir George's elde&s;t &s;on came home from his travels. His figure, his addre&s;s, and con|ver&s;ation, were not unlike tho&s;e warm ideas of an accompli&s;hed man which my favourite novels had taught me to form; and his &s;entiments, on the article of religion, were as liberal as my own: when any of the&s;e happened to be the topic of our di&s;cour&s;e, I, who before had been &s;ilent, from a fear of being &s;ingle in oppo&s;i|tion, now kindled at the fire he rai&s;ed, and defended our mutual opinions with all the eloquence I was mi&s;tre&s;s of.</P>
<P>"He was commonly re&s;pectfully attentive all the while; and when I had ended, would rai&s;e his eyes from the ground, look at me with a gaze of admiration, and expre&s;s his applau&s;e in the high|e&s;t &s;train of encomium. This was an incen&s;e the more plea&s;ing, as I &s;eldom or never had met with it before; for the young gentlemen who vi&s;ited Sir George were for the mo&s;t part of that athletic or|der, the plea&s;ure of who&s;e lives is derived from fox-hunting: the&s;e are &s;eldom &s;olicitous to plea&s;e the women at all; or if they were, would never think of applying their flattery to the mind.</P>
<P>"Mr. Winbrooke ob&s;erved the weakne&s;s of my &s;oul, and took every occa&s;ion of improving the e&s;teem he had gained. He a&s;ked my opinion of every author, of every &s;entiment, with that &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ive diffidence, which &s;hewed an unlimited confidence, in my un|der&s;tanding. I &s;aw my&s;elf reverend, as a &s;uperior &s;ort of being, by one who&s;e judgment my vanity told me was not likely to err; preferred by him to all the other vi&s;itors of my &s;ex, who&s;e &s;uperior fortunes and rank &s;hould have entitled them to a much higher degree of notice, I &s;aw their little jealou&s;ies at the di&s;tingui&s;hed attention he paid me; it was gratitude, it was pride, it was love! Love which had made too fatal a progre&s;s in my heart, before any declaration on his part &s;hould have warrant|ed a return: but I interpreted every look of attention, every ex|pre&s;&s;ion of compliment, to the pa&s;&s;ion I imagined him in&s;pired with, and imputed to his &s;en&s;ibility that &s;ilence which was the ef|fect of art and de&s;ign.</P>
<P>"At length, however, he took an opportunity of declaring his love: he now expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in &s;uch ardent terms, that prudence might have &s;u&s;pected their &s;incerity; but prudence is rarely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in the &s;ituation I had been unguardedly led into; be&s;ides, that the cour&s;e of reading to which I had been accu&s;tomed, did not lead me to conclude, that his expre&s;&s;ions could be too warm to be &s;incere: nor was I even alarmed at the manner in which he talked of marriage, a &s;ubjection, he often hinted, to which genuine love &s;hould &s;corn to be confined.</P>
<P>"The woman, he would often &s;ay, who had me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it like mine to fix his affection, could ea&s;ily command it for ever. That honour too which I revered, was often called in to enforce his &s;entiments&punc; I did not, however, ab&s;olutely a&s;&s;ent to them; but I found my regard for the oppo&s;ite ones dimini&s;h by degrees. If it is danger|ous
<PB N="30" REF="017579_0034_0FA12F20B25EE9A8">
to be convinced, it is ever dangerous to li&s;ten; for our rea&s;on is &s;o much of a machine, that it will not always be able to re&s;i&s;t, when the ear is perpetually a&s;&s;ailed.</P>
<P>"In &s;hort, Mr. Harley, (for I tire you with a relation, the cata&s;trophe of which you will already have imagined) I fell a prey to his artifices. He had not been able &s;o thoroughly to convert me, that my con&s;cience was &s;ilent on the &s;ubject; but he was &s;o a&s;&s;iduous to &s;hew repeated proofs of unabated affection, that I hu&s;hed its &s;ugge&s;tions as they ro&s;e.</P>
<P>"The world, however, I knew, was not to be &s;ilenced; and therefore I took &s;ome occa&s;ion to expre&s;s my unea&s;ine&s;s to my &s;e|ducer, and intreat him, as he valued the peace of one to whom he profe&s;&s;ed &s;uch an attachment, to remove it by a marriage. He made an excu&s;e from the dependance he was under on the will of his father, but quieted my fears by the promi&s;e of endeavouring to win his a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>"My father had been &s;ome days ab&s;ent on a journey to &s;ee a relation, who was thought to be dying, from whom he had con|&s;iderable expectations. I was left at home, with no other compa|ny than my books: my books I found were not now &s;uch compa|nions as they u&s;ed to be; I was re&s;tle&s;s, melancholy, un&s;atisfied with my&s;elf. But judge my &s;ituation when I received a billet from Mr. Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">brooke, informing me, that he had &s;ounded Sir George on the &s;ubject we had talked of, and found him &s;o aver&s;e to any match &s;o unequal to his own rank and fortune, that he was obliged, with whatever reluctance, to bid adieu to a place, the remembrance of which &s;hould ever be dear to him.</P>
<P>"I read this letter a hundred times over. Alone, helple&s;s, con&s;cious of guilt, and abandoned by every better thought, my mind was one dreadful &s;cene of terror, confu&s;ion, and remor&s;e. A thou&s;and expedients &s;ugge&s;ted them&s;elves, and a thou&s;and fears told me they would be vain: at la&s;t, in an agony of de&s;pair, I packed up a few clothes, took what money and trinkets were in the hou&s;e, and &s;et out for London, where I under&s;tood he was gone, pretending to my maid, that I had received letters from my father requiring my immediate attendance. I had no other com|panion than a boy, a &s;ervant to the man from whom I hired my hor&s;es. I arrived in London within an hour of of Mr. Winbrooke, and accidentally alighted at the very inn where he was.</P>
<P>"He &s;tarted and turned pale when he &s;aw me; but recovered him&s;elf in time enough to make many new prote&s;tations of regard, and beg me to make my&s;elf ea&s;y under a di&s;appointment which was equally afflicting to him. He procured me lodgings, where I &s;lept, or rather endeavoured to &s;leep, for that night. Next morning I &s;aw him again; he then mildly ob&s;erved on the impru|dence of my precipitate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ight from the country, and propo&s;ed my removing to lodgings at another end of the town, to elude the &s;earch of my father, till he &s;hould fall on &s;ome method of excu&s;ing my conduct to him, and reconciling him to my return. We took a hackney-coach, and drove to the hou&s;e he mentioned&punc;</P>

"It was &s;ituated in a dirty lane, furni&s;hed with a taudry affec|tation of finery, with &s;ome old family pictures hanging on walls which their own cobwebs would have better &s;uited. I was &s;truck with a &s;ecret dread at entering; nor was it le&s;&s;ened by the appear|ance of the landlady, who had that look of &s;elfi&s;h &s;hrewdne&s;s, which, of all others, is the mo&s;t hateful to tho&s;e who&s;e feelings are untinctured with the world. A girl, who &s;he told us was her niece, &s;at be&s;ide her, playing on a guitar, and &s;he her&s;elf was &s;ewing, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;pectacles, and had a prayer book, with the leaves folded down in &s;everal places, lying on the table before her. Perhaps, Sir, I tire you with my minutene&s;s; but the place, and every circum&s;tance about it, is &s;o impre&s;&s;ed on my mind, that I &s;hall never forget it.</P>
<P>"I dined that day with Mr. Winbrooke alone. He lo&s;t by de|grees that re&s;traint which I perceived too well to hang about him before, and, with his former gaiety and good-humour, repeated the flattering things, which though they had once been fatal, I dur&s;t not now di&s;tru&s;t. At la&s;t, taking my hand and ki&s;&s;ing it,</P>
<P>"It is thus, &s;aid he, that love will la&s;t, while freedom is pre|&s;erved; thus let us ever be ble&s;t, without the galling thought that we are tied to a condition where we may cea&s;e to be &s;o." I an&s;wered,</P>
<P>"That the world thought otherwi&s;e; that it had certain ideas of good fame, which it was impo&s;&s;ible not to wi&s;h to maintain."</P>
<P>"The world, &s;aid he, is a tyrant; they are &s;laves who obey it: let us be happy without the pale of the world. To-morrow I &s;hall leave this quarter of it, for one, where the talkers of the world &s;hall be foiled, and lo&s;e us. Could not my Emily accompany me? my friend, my companion, the mi&s;tre&s;s of my &s;oul! Nay, do not look &s;o, Emily! your father may grieve for a while, but your father &s;hall be taken care of; this bank-bill I intend as the com|fort for his daughter."</P>
<P>"I could contain my&s;elf no longer: Wretch, I exclaimed, do&s;t thou imagine that my father's heart could brook dependance on the de&s;toryer of his child, and tamely accept of a ba&s;e equivalent for her honour and his own!" "Honour, my Emily, &s;aid he, is the word of fools, or of tho&s;e wi&s;er men who cheat them. It is a fan|ta&s;tic bauble that does not &s;uit the gravity of your father's age; but, whatever it is, I am afraid it can never be perfectly re&s;tored to you: exchange the word then, and let plea&s;ure be your object now." At the&s;e words he cla&s;ped me in his arms, and pre&s;&s;ed his lips rudely to my bo&s;om. I &s;tarted from my &s;eat, "Perfidious villain! &s;aid I, who dare&s;t in&s;ult the weakne&s;s thou ha&s;t undone; were that father here, thy coward &s;oul would &s;hrink from the ven|geance of his honour! Cur&s;t be that wretch who has deprived him of it! oh! doubly cur&s;t, who has dragged on his hoary head the infamy which &s;hould have cru&s;hed her own!" I &s;natched a knife which lay be&s;ide me, and would have plunged it in my brea&s;t; but the mon&s;ter prevented my purpo&s;e, and &s;miling with the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">in of barbarous in&s;ult, "Madam, &s;aid he, I confe&s;s you are

rather too much in heroics for me: I am &s;orry we &s;hould differ about trifles; but as I &s;eem &s;omehow to have offended you, I would willingly remedy it by taking my leave. You have been put to &s;ome fooli&s;h expence in this journey on my account; allow me to reimbur&s;e you." So &s;aying, he laid a bank-bill, of what amount I had no patience to &s;ee, upon the table. Shame, grief, and in|dignation, choaked my utterance; unable to &s;peak my wrongs, and unable to bear them in &s;ilence, I fell in a &s;woon at his feet.</P>
<P>"What happened in the interval I cannot tell; but when I came to my&s;elf, I was in the arms of the landlady, with her niece chaffing, my temples, and doing all in her power for my recovery. She had much compa&s;&s;ion in her countenance: the old woman a&s;|&s;umed the &s;ofte&s;t look &s;he was capable of, and both endeavoured to bring me comfort. They continued to &s;hew me many civilities, and even the aunt began to &s;eem agreeable in my &s;ight. To the wretched, to the forlorn, as I was, &s;mall offices of kindne&s;s are en|dearing.</P>
<P>"Mean time my money was fa&s;t &s;pent, nor did I attempt to conceal my wants from their knowledge. I had frequent thoughts of returning to my father: but the dread of a life of &s;corn is in|&s;urmountable. I avoided therefore going abroad when I had a chance of being &s;een by any former acquaintance, nor indeed did my health for a great while permit it; and &s;uffered the old woman, at her own &s;ugge&s;tion, to call me niece at home, where we now and then &s;aw (when they could prevail on me to leave my room) one or two other elderly women, and &s;ometimes a grave bu&s;ine&s;s|like man, who &s;hewed great compa&s;&s;ion for my indi&s;po&s;ition, and made me very obligingly an offer of a room at his country-hou&s;e for the r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">covery of my health. This offer I did not choo&s;e to ac|cept; but told my landlady, "that I &s;hould be glad to be employ|ed in any way of bu&s;ine&s;s which my &s;kill in needle-work could re|commend me to; confe&s;&s;ing, at the &s;ame time, that I was afraid I &s;hould &s;carce be able to pay her what I already owed for board and lodging, and that for her other good offices, I had nothing but thanks to give her."</P>
<P>"My dear child, &s;aid &s;he, do not talk of paying; &s;ince I lo&s;t my own &s;weet girl, (here &s;he wept) your very picture &s;he was, Mi&s;s Emily, I have no body, except my niece, to whom I &s;hould leave any little thing I have been able to &s;ave: you &s;hall live with me, my dear, and I have &s;ometimes a little millinery work, which, when you are inclined to it, you may a&s;&s;i&s;t us in.

<P>"It was a pity you refu&s;ed his offer of a room at his country-hou&s;e; my niece, you know, was to have accompanied you, and you might have fancied your&s;elf at home: a mo&s;t &s;weet place it is, and but a &s;hort mile beyond Hamp&s;tead. Who knows Mi&s;s Emily,
<PB N="33" REF="017579_0037_0FA12F22EDCBE468">
what effects &s;uch a vi&s;it might have had: if I had half your beau|ty, I &s;hould not wa&s;te it pining after e'er a worthle&s;s fellow of them all."</P>
<P>I felt my heart &s;well at her words; I would have been angry if I could; but I was in that &s;tupid &s;tate which is not ea&s;ily awakened to anger: when I would have chid her, the reproof &s;tuck in my throat; I could only weep!</P>
<P>"Her want of re&s;pect increa&s;ed, as I had not &s;pirit to a&s;&s;ert it; my work was now rather impo&s;ed than offered, and I became a drudge for the bread I eat: but my dependance and &s;ervility grew in proportion, and I was now in a &s;ituation which could not make any extraordinary exertions to di&s;engage it&s;elf from either; I found my&s;elf with child.</P>
<P>"At la&s;t the wretch, who had thus trained me to de&s;truction, hinted the purpo&s;e for which the&s;e means had been followed. I di&s;covered her to be an artful procure&s;s for the plea&s;ures of tho&s;e, who are men of decency to the world in the mid&s;t of debauchery. I rou&s;ed every &s;park of courage within me at the horrid propo&s;al. She treated my pa&s;&s;ion at fir&s;t &s;omewhat mildly; but when I con|tinued to exert it, &s;he re&s;ented it with in&s;ult, and told me plainly, That if I did not &s;oon comply with her de&s;ires, I &s;hould pay her every farthing I owed, or rot in a gaol for life.</P>
<P>"I trembled at the thought; &s;till, however, I re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;ted her impor|tunities, and &s;he put her threats in execution. I was conveyed to pri&s;on, weak from my condition, weaker from that &s;truggle of grief and mi&s;ery which for &s;ome time I had &s;uffered. A mi&s;car|riage was the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>"Amid&s;t all the horrors of &s;uch a &s;tate, &s;urrounded with wretch|es callous to feeling, lo&s;t alike to humanity and to &s;hame, think, Mr. Harley, think, what I endured: nor wonder that I at la&s;t yielded to the &s;olicitations of that mi&s;creant I had &s;een at her hou&s;e, and &s;unk to the pro&s;titution which he offered. But that was happi|ne&s;s compared to what I have &s;uffered &s;ince. He &s;oon abandoned me to the common u&s;e of the town, and I was ca&s;t among tho&s;e mi&s;erable beings in who&s;e &s;ociety I have &s;ince remained.</P>
<P>"Oh! did the daughters of virtue know our &s;ufferings! did they &s;ee our hearts torn with angui&s;h amid&s;t the affectation of gaie|ty which our faces are obliged to a&s;&s;ume! our bodies tortured by di&s;ea&s;e, our minds with that con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s which they cannot lo&s;e!

<P>"La&s;t night, but for an exertion of benevolence which the in|fection of our infamy prevents even in the humane, had I been thru&s;t out from this mi&s;erable place which misfortune has yet left me; expo&s;ed to the brutal in&s;ults of drunkenne&s;s, or dragged by that ju&s;tice which I could not bribe, to the puni&s;hment which may correct, but, alas! can never amend the abandoned objects of its terrors.

<P>She had &s;carce uttered the word, when the door bur&s;t open, and a man entered in the garb of an officer.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIX. The di&s;tre&s;&s;es of a father.</HEAD>
<P>HARLEY kneeled al&s;o at the &s;ide of his unfortunate daughter; "Allow me, Sir, &s;aid he, to intreat your pardon for one who&s;e offences have been already &s;o &s;ignally puni&s;hed. I know, I feel, that the&s;e tears, wrung from the heart of a father, are more dreadful to her than all the puni&s;hments your &s;word could have in|flicted: accept the contrition of a child whom heaven has re&s;tored to you." "Is &s;he not lo&s;t, an&s;wered he, irrecoverably lo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Damnation! a common pro&s;titute to the meane&s;t ruffian!"&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="017579_0039_0FA12F246A131670">
"Calmly, my dear Sir, &s;aid Harley, did you know by what complicated misfortunes &s;he has fallen to that mi&s;erable &s;tate in which you now behold her, I &s;hould have no need of words to ex|cite your compa&s;&s;ion. Think, Sir, of what once &s;he was! Would you abandon her to the in&s;ults of an unfeeling world, deny her op|portunity for penitence, and cut off the little comfort that &s;till re|mains for your afflictions and her own!"</P>
<P>"Speak, &s;aid he, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to his daughter; &s;peak, I will hear the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">"&mdash;The de&s;peration that &s;upported her was lo&s;t; &s;he fell to the ground, and bathed his feet with her tears!</P>
<P>Harley undertook her cau&s;e: he related the treacheries to which &s;he had fallen a &s;acrifice, and again &s;olicited the forgivene&s;s of her father. He looked on her for &s;ome time in &s;ilence; the pride of a &s;oldier's honour checked for a while the yearnings of his heart: but nature at la&s;t prevailed, he fell on her neck, and mingled his tears with hers. Harley, who di&s;covered from the dre&s;s of the &s;tranger that he was ju&s;t arrived from a journey, begged that they would both remove to his lodgings, till he could procure others for them. Atkins looked at him with &s;ome marks of &s;ur|pri&s;e. His daughter now fir&s;t recovered the power of &s;peech:</P>
<P>"W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">etch as I am, &s;aid &s;he, yet there is &s;ome gratitude due to the pre&s;erver of your child. See him now before you. To him I owe my l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e, or at lea&s;t the comfort of imploring your forgivene&s;s before I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">."</P>
<P>"Pardon me, young gentleman, &s;aid Atkins, I fear my pa&s;&s;i|on wronged you."</P>
<P>"Never, never, Sir, &s;aid Harley; if it had, your reconciliati|on to your daughter were an atonement a thou&s;and fold." He then repeated his reque&s;t that he might be allowed to conduct them to his lodgings, to which Mr. Atkins at la&s;t con&s;ented.</P>
<P>He took his daughter's arm, "Come, my Emily, &s;aid he, we can never, never recover that happine&s;s we have lo&s;t; but time may teach us to remember our misfortunes with patience."</P>
<P>When they arrived at the hou&s;e where Harley lodged, he was in|formed, that the fir&s;t floor was then vacant, and that the gentle|man and his daughter might be accommodated there. While he was upon this inquiry, Mi&s;s Atkins informed her father more par|ticularly what &s;he owed to his benevolence. When he returned in|to the room where they were, Atkins ran and embraced him; begged him again to forgive the offence he had given him, and made the warme&s;t prote&s;tations of gratitude for his favours. We would attempt to de&s;cribe the joy which Harley felt on this occa&s;i|on, did it not occur to us, that one half of the world could not un|der&s;tand it though we did; and the other half will, by this time, have under&s;tood it without any de&s;cription at all.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Atkins now retired to her chamber, to take &s;ome re&s;t from the violence of the&s;e emotions &s;he had &s;uffered. When &s;he was gone, her father, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Harley, &s;aid, "You have a right, Sir. to be informed of the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of one who
<PB N="36" REF="017579_0040_0FA12F26A5E7B088">
owes &s;o much to your compa&s;&s;ion for his misfortunes. My daugh|ter I find has informed you what that was at the fatal period when they began.</P>
<P>Her di&s;tre&s;&s;es you have heard, you have pitied as they de&s;erved; mine perhaps I cannot &s;o ea&s;ily make you acquainted with. You have a feeling heart, Mr. Harley; I ble&s;s it that it has &s;aved my child; but you never were a father; a father torn by that mo&s;t dreadful of calamities, the di&s;honour of a child he doated on! You have been already informed of &s;ome of the circum&s;tances of her elopement.</P>
<P>I was then from home, called by the death of a relation, who, though he would never advance me a &s;hilling on the utmo&s;t exigen|cy in his life-time, left me all the gleanings of his frugality at his death. I would not write this intelligence to my daughter, be|cau&s;e I intended to be the bearer of the news my&s;elf; and &s;oon as my bu&s;ine&s;s would allow me, I &s;et out on my return, winged with all the ha&s;te of paternal affection. I fondly built tho&s;e &s;chemes of future happine&s;s, which the flattery of pre&s;ent pro&s;perity is ever bu&s;y to &s;ugge&s;t: my Emily was concerned in them all.</P>
<P>As I approached our little dwelling, my heart throbbed with the anticipation of joy and welcome. I imagined the cheering &s;ire, the bli&s;sful contentment of a frugal meal, made luxurious by a daughter's &s;miles: I painted to my&s;elf her &s;urprize at the tidings of our new-acquired riches, our fond di&s;putes about the di&s;po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">l of them.</P>
<P>"The road was &s;hortened by the dreams of happine&s;s I enjoyed, and it began to de dark as I reached the hou&s;e: I alighted from my hor&s;e, and walked &s;oftly up &s;tairs to the room we commonly &s;at in. I was &s;omewhat di&s;appointed at not finding my daughter there. I rung the bell; her maid appeared, and &s;hewed no &s;mall &s;igns of wonder at the &s;ummons. She ble&s;&s;ed her&s;elf as &s;he entered the room: I &s;miled at her &s;urprize. "Where is Mi&s;s Emily, Sir?" &s;aid &s;he, "Emily!" "Yes, Sir; &s;he has been gone from hence &s;ome days, upon receipt of the&s;e letters you &s;ent her." "Let|ters!" &s;aid I. "Yes, Sir; &s;o &s;he told me, and went off in all ha&s;te that very night."</P>
<P>"I &s;tood agha&s;t as &s;he &s;poke; but was able &s;o far to recollect my&s;elf, as to put on the affectation of calmne&s;s, and telling her there was certainly &s;ome mi&s;take in the affair, de&s;ired her to leave me.</P>
<P>"When &s;he was gone, I threw my&s;elf into a chair in that &s;tate of uncertainty which is of all others the mo&s;t dreadful. The gay vi&s;ions I had delighted my&s;elf with, vani&s;hed in an in&s;tant: I was tortured with tracing back the &s;ame circle of doubt and di&s;appoint|ment. My head grew dizzy, as I thought: I called the &s;ervant again, and a&s;ked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">er a hundred que&s;tions to no purpo&s;e; there was not room even for conjecture.</P>
<P>"Something <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> la&s;t aro&s;e in my mind, which we call Hope, without knowing what it was. I wi&s;hed my&s;elf deluded by it;
<PB N="37" REF="017579_0041_0FA12F26F2C0C088">
but it could not prevail over my returning fears. I ro&s;e and walked through the room. My Emily's &s;pinet &s;tood at the end of it, open&punc; with a book of mu&s;ic folded down at &s;ome of my favourite le&s;&s;ons&punc; I touched the keys; there was a vibration in the &s;ound that fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> my blood: I looked round, and methought the family-pictures on the walls gazed on me with compa&s;&s;ion in their faces. I &s;at down again with an attempt at more compo&s;ure; I &s;tarted at every creaking of the door, and my ears rung with imaginary noi&s;es!</P>
<P>"I had not remained long in this &s;ituation, when the arrival of a friend, who had accidentally heard of my return, put an end to my doubts, by the recital of my daughter's di&s;honour. He told me he had his information from a young gentleman, to whom Winbrooke had boa&s;ted of his having &s;educed her.</P>
<P>"I &s;tarted from my &s;eat, with broken cur&s;es on my lips, and without knowing whither I &s;hould pur&s;ue them, ordered my &s;ervant to load my pi&s;tol, and &s;addle my hor&s;es. My friend, however&punc; with great difficulty per&s;uaded me to compo&s;e my&s;elf for that night&punc; promi&s;ing to accompany me on the morrow to Sir George Win|brooke's in que&s;t of his &s;on.</P>
<P>"The morrow came, after a night &s;pent in a &s;tate little di&s;tant from madne&s;s. We went as early as decency would allow to Sir George's; he received me with politene&s;s, and indeed compa&s;&s;ion&punc; prote&s;ted his abhorrence of his &s;on's conduct, and told me tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> he had &s;et out &s;ome days before for London, on which place he had procured a draught for a large &s;um, on pretence of fini&s;hing his travels; but that he had not heard from him &s;ince his departure.</P>
<P>"I did not wait for any more, either of information <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> comfort, but again&s;t the united remon&s;trances of Sir George and my friend, &s;et out in&s;tantly for London with a frantic uncertainty of purpo&s;es but there all manner of &s;earch was in vain. I could trace <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">either of them any farther than the inn they fir&s;t put up at on their arrival&punc; and after &s;ome days fruitle&s;s enquiry, returned home de&s;titute of every little hope that had hitherto &s;upported me. The journies I had made, the re&s;tle&s;s nights I had &s;pent, above all, the pert<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|bation of my mind, had the effect which might naturally be ex|pected; a very dangerous fever was the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>"From this, however, contrary to the expectation of my phy|&s;icians, I recovered. It was new that I fir&s;t felt &s;omething <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> calmne&s;s of mind; probably from being reduced to a &s;tate which could not produce the exer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ions of angui&s;h or de&s;pair.

<P>As he &s;poke the&s;e la&s;t words, his voice trembled in his throat; it was now lo&s;t in his tears! He &s;at with his face half turned from Harley, as if he would have hid the &s;orrow which he felt. Harley was in the &s;ame attitude him&s;elf; he dur&s;t not meet his eye with a tear; but gathering his &s;tifled breath, "Let me intreat you, Sir, &s;aid he, to hope better things. The world is ever tyrannical; it warps our &s;orrows to edge them with keener affliction: let us not be &s;laves to the names it affixes to motive or to action.

<P>THE company in the &s;tage-coach con&s;i&s;ted of a grocer and his wife, who were going to pay a vi&s;it to &s;ome of their country friends; a young officer, who took this way of marching to quar|ters; a middle-aged gentlewoman, who had been hired as a hou&s;e-keeper to &s;ome family in the country; and an elderly well looking man, with a remarkably old fa&s;hioned periwig.</P>
<P>Harley, upon entering, di&s;covered but one vacant &s;eat, next the grocer's wife, which, from his natural &s;hyne&s;s of temper, he made no &s;cruple to occupy, though he knew that being driven back|wards di&s;agreed with him.</P>
<P>Though his inclination to phy&s;iognomy had met with &s;ome rubs in the metropolis, he had not yet lo&s;t his attachment to that &s;cience: he &s;et him&s;elf therefore to examine the countenances of his compan|ions, as u&s;ual. In this indeed he was not long in doubt as to the preference; for be&s;ides that the elderly gentleman, who &s;at oppo|&s;ite
<PB N="40" REF="017579_0044_0FA12F28ECF59520">
are to him, had features by nature more expre&s;&s;ive of good di&s;po&s;i|tions, there was &s;omething in that periwig we mentioned peculiar|ly attractive of Harley's regard.</P>
<P>He had not been long employed in the&s;e &s;peculations, when he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound him&s;elf attacked with that fainti&s;h &s;ickne&s;s, which was the natural con&s;equence of his &s;ituation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> coach. The palene&s;s of his countenance was fir&s;t ob&s;erved by the hou&s;e keeper, who imme|diately made offer of her &s;melling bottle, which Harley however <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ined, telling at the &s;ame time the cau&s;e of his unea&s;ine&s;s. The gentleman on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the coach now fir&s;t turned his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ide direction in which it had been fixed, and begged Harley to exchange places w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">h him, expre&s;&s;ing his regret that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> not made the propo&s;al before. Harley thanked him; and up|on being a&s;&s;ured that both &s;eats were alike to him, was about to accept of his offer, when the young gentleman of the &s;word, put|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> on an arch look, laid hold of the other's arm, "So, my old <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oy, &s;aid he, I find you have &s;till &s;ome youthful blood about you, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, with your leave, I will do my&s;elf the honour of &s;itting by this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">" and took his place accordingly. The grocer &s;tared him as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">all in the face as his own &s;hort neck would allow of; and his wife, who was a little round faced woman, with a great deal of colour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> her cheeks, drew up at the compliment that was paid her, look|ing fir&s;t at the officer, and then at the hou&s;e-keeper.</P>
<P>"This incident was prod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uctive of &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e; for before, though there was &s;ometimes a cough or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">em from the grocer, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> officer now and then hummed a few notes of a &s;ong, there had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ot a &s;ingle word pa&s;&s;ed the lips of any of company.</P>
<P>Mrs. Grocer ob&s;erved, how ill-convenient it was for people, who could not be drove backwards, to travel in a&s;tage-coach. This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ought on a differtion on &s;tage coaches in general, and the plea|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">are of keeping a chay of one's own; which led to another, on the great riches of Mr. Deputy Bear&s;kin, who according to her, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> once been of that indu&s;trious order of youths who &s;weep the cro&s;&s;ings of the &s;treets for the conveniency of pa&s;&s;engers, but, by various fortunate accidents, had now acquired an immen&s;e fortune, and kept his coach and a dozen livery-&s;ervants.</P>
<P>All this afforded ample fund for conver&s;ation, if conver&s;ation it might, be called, that was carried on &s;olely by the before-mentioned lady, nobody offering to interrupt her, except that the officer &s;ometimes &s;ignified his approbation by a variety of oaths, a &s;ort of phra&s;eology he &s;eemed extremely conver&s;ant in.</P>
<P>She appealed indeed frequently to her hu&s;band as to the authen|ticity of certain facts, which the good man as often prote&s;ted his entire ignorance of; but as he was always called fool, or &s;ome|thing very like it, for his pains, he at la&s;t contrived to a&s;&s;i&s;t the credit of his wife without prejudice to his con&s;cience, and &s;ignifi|ed his a&s;&s;ent by a noi&s;e not unlike the grunting of that animal which in &s;hape and fatne&s;s he &s;omewhat re&s;embled. The hou&s;e-keeper, and the old gentleman who &s;at next to Harley, were now
<PB N="41" REF="017579_0045_0FA12F29AC608110">
ob&s;erved to be fa&s;t a&s;leep; at which the lady, who had been at &s;uch pains to entertain them, muttered &s;ome words of di&s;plea&s;ure, and, upon the officer's whi&s;pering to &s;moak the old put, both &s;he and her hu&s;band pur&s;ed up their mouths into a contemptuous &s;mile, Harley looked &s;ternly on the grocer: "You are come, Sir, &s;aid he, to tho&s;e years when you might have learned &s;ome reverence for age: as for this young man, who has &s;o lately e&s;caped from the nur&s;ery, he may be allowed to divert him&s;elf." "Dam'me, Sir, &s;aid the officer, do you call me young?" &s;triking up the front of his hat, and &s;tretching forward on his &s;eat, till his face almo&s;t touched Harley's. It is probable, however, that he di&s;covered &s;omething there which tended to pacify him; for, on the lady's in|treating them not to quarrel, he very &s;oon re&s;umed his po&s;ture and calmne&s;s together, and was rather le&s;s profu&s;e of his oaths during the re&s;t of the journey. It is po&s;&s;ible the old gentleman had waked time enough to hear the la&s;t part of this di&s;cour&s;e; at lea&s;t (whether from that cau&s;e, or that he too was a phy&s;iognomi&s;t) he wore a look remarkably complacent to Harley, who, on his part, &s;hewed a particular ob&s;ervance of him: indeed they had &s;oon a better opportunity of making their acquaintance, as the coach arrived that night at the town where the officer's regiment lay, and the places of de&s;tination of their other fellow-travellers, it &s;eems, were at no great di&s;tance; for next morning the old gen|tleman and Harley were the only pa&s;&s;engers remaining.</P>
<P>When they left the inn in the morning, Harley, pulling out a little pocket book, began to examine the contents, and make &s;ome corrections with a pencil. "This, &s;aid he, turning to his com|panion, is an amu&s;ement I &s;ometimes pa&s;s idle hours at an inn with: the&s;e are quotations from tho&s;e humble poets, who tru&s;t their fame to the brittle tenure of windows and drinking-gla&s;&s;es."</P>
<P>"From our inns, returned the gentleman, a &s;tranger might ima|gine that we were a nation of poets; machines at lea&s;t, which con|&s;trained with the motion of a journey emptied of their contents: is it from the vanity of being thought men of genius, or a mere mechanical imitation of the cu&s;tom of others, that we are led to &s;crawl rhime upon &s;uch places?"</P>
<P>"Whether vanity is the cau&s;e of our becoming rhime&s;ters or not, an&s;wered Harley, it is a pretty certain effect of it. An old man of my acquaintance, who deals in apophthegms, u&s;ed to &s;ay, That he had known few men without envy, few wits without ill-nature, and no poet without vanity; and I believe his remark is a pretty ju&s;t one: vanity has been immemorially the charter of poets. In this the ancients were more hone&s;t than we are; the old poets fre|quently make boa&s;tful predictions of the immortality their works &s;hall acquire them; ours, in their dedications and prefatory di&s;|cour&s;es, employ much eloquence to prai&s;e their patrons, with much &s;eeming mode&s;ty to condemn them&s;elves, or at lea&s;t to apologize for their productions to the world: but this, in my opinion, is the mo&s;t a&s;&s;uming manner of the two; for of all the garbs, I ever
<PB N="42" REF="017579_0046_0FA12F2A6DAE4E30">
&s;aw pride put on, that of her humility is to me the mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;t|ing."</P>
<P>"It is natural enough for a poet to be vain, &s;aid the &s;tranger: the little worlds which he rai&s;es, the in&s;piration which he claims, may ea&s;ily be productive of &s;elf-importance; though that in&s;pirati|on is fabulous, it brings on egoti&s;m, which is always the parent of vanity."</P>
<P>"It may be &s;uppo&s;ed, an&s;wered Harley, that in&s;piration of old was an article of religious faith; in modern times it may be tran&s;lated a propen&s;ity to compo&s;e; and I believe it is not always mo&s;t readily found where the poets have fixed its re&s;idence, amid&s;t groves and plains, and the &s;cenes of pa&s;toral retirement. The mind may be there unb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> from the cares of the world; but it will fre|quently, at the &s;ame time, be unnerved from any great exertion: it will feel imperfect ideas which it cannot expre&s;s, and wander without effort over the regions of reflection."</P>
<P>"There is at lea&s;t, &s;aid the &s;tranger, one advantage in the poe|tical inclination, that it is an incentive to philanthrophy. There is a certain poetical ground, on which a man cannot tread without feelings that enlarge the heart, the cau&s;es of human depravity vani&s;h before the romantic enthu&s;ia&s;m he profe&s;tes; and many who are not able to reach the Parna&s;&s;ian heights, may yet approach &s;o near as to be bettered by the air of the climate."</P>
<P>"I have always thought &s;o, replied Harley; but this is an ar|gument with the prudent again&s;t it: they urge the danger of unfit|ne&s;s for the world."</P>
<P>"I allow it, returned the other; but I believe it is not always rightfully imputed to the bent for poetry: this is only one effect of the common cau&s;e.&mdash;Jack, &s;ays his father, is indeed no &s;cholar; nor could all the drubbings from his ma&s;ter ever bring him one bit forward in his grammar or his &s;yntax: but I intend him for a merchant.&mdash;Allow the &s;ame indulgence to Tom.&mdash;</P>
<P>"Tom reads Virgil and Horace when he &s;hould be ca&s;ting ac|compts; and but t'other day he pawned his great coat for an edi|tion of Shake&s;peare.&mdash;But Tom would have been as he is, though Virgil and Horace had never been born, though Shake&s;peare had died a link boy; for his nur&s;e will tell you, that when he was a child, he broke his rattle, to di&s;cover what it was that &s;ounded within it; and burnt the &s;ticks of his go-cart, becau&s;e le liked to &s;ee the &s;parkling of timber in the fire.&mdash;</P>
<P>"It is a &s;ad ca&s;e; but what is to be done?&mdash;Why Jack &s;hall grow rich, dine on veni&s;on, and drink claret.&mdash;Ay, but Tom&mdash;Tom &s;hall dine with his brother, when his pride will let him; at other times, he &s;hall ble&s;s God over a half-pint of ale and a Wel&s;h|rabbit; and both &s;hall go to heaven as they may.&mdash;That's a poor pro&s;pect for Tom, &s;ays the father.&mdash;To go to heaven! I cannot agree with him."</P>
<P>"Perhaps, &s;aid Harley, we now a-days di&s;courage the romantic turn a little too much. Our boys are prudent too &s;oon. Mi&s;take
<PB N="43" REF="017579_0047_0FA12F2B2C7BFC38">
me not, I do not mean to blame them for want of levity or di&s;&s;ipa|tion; but their plea&s;ures are tho&s;e of hackneyed vice, blunted to every finer emotion by the repetition of debauch; and their de&s;ire of plea&s;ure is warped to the de&s;ire of wealth, as the means of pro|curing it.</P>
<P>"The immen&s;e riches acquired by individuals has erected a &s;tandard of ambition, de&s;tructive of private morals, and of public virtue. The weakne&s;ses of vice are left us; but the mo&s;t allow|able of our failings we are taught to de&s;pi&s;e. Love, the pa&s;&s;ion mo&s;t natural to the &s;en&s;ibility of youth, has lo&s;t the plaintive digni|ty he once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, for the unmeaning &s;imper of a dangling cox|comb; and the only &s;erious concern, that of a dowry, is &s;ettled, even among&s;t the beardle&s;s leaders of the dancing-&s;chool The Frivolous and the Intere&s;ted (might a &s;atyri&s;t &s;ay) are the character|i&s;tical features of the age; they are vi&s;ible even in the e&s;&s;ays of our philo&s;ophers.</P>
<P>"They laugh at the pedantry of our fathers, who complained of the times in which they lived; they are at pains to per&s;uade us how much the&s;e were deceived; they pride them&s;elves in defending things as they find them, and in exploding the barren &s;ounds which had been reared into motives for action. To this their &s;tile is &s;uited; and the manly tone of rea&s;on is exchanged for perpetu|al efforts at &s;neer and ridicule. This I hold to be an alarming cri&s;is in the corruption of a &s;tate; when not only is virtue declined and vice prevailing, but when the prai&s;es of virtue are forgotten, and the infamy of vice unfelt."</P>
<P>They &s;oon after arrived at the next inn upon the route of the &s;tage coach, when the &s;tranger told Harley, that his brother's hou&s;e to which he was returning, lay at no great di&s;tance, and he mu&s;t therefore unwillingly bid him adieu.</P>
<P>"I &s;hould like, &s;aid Harley, taking his hand, to have &s;ome word to remember &s;o much &s;eeming worth by: my name is Har|ley."&mdash;"I &s;hall remember it an&s;wered the old gentleman, in my prayers: mine is Silton."</P>
<P>And Silton indeed it was; Ben Silton him&s;elf! Once more, my honoured friend, farewell!&mdash;Born to be happy without the world, to that peaceful happine&s;s which the world has not to be&s;tow! En|vy never &s;cowled on thy life, nor hatred &s;miled on thy grave.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIV. He meets an old acquaintance.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the &s;tage coach arrived at the place of its de&s;tination, Harley began to con&s;ider how he &s;hould proceed the re|maining part of his journey. He was very civilly acco&s;ted by the ma&s;ter of the inn where he alighted, who offered to accomodate him either with a po&s;t-chai&s;e or hor&s;es, to any di&s;tance he had a
<PB N="44" REF="017579_0048_0FA12F2BEFED0718">
mind: but as he did things frequently in a way different from what other people call natural, he refu&s;ed the&s;e offers, and &s;et out immediately a foot, having fir&s;t put a &s;pare &s;hirt in his pocket, and given directions for the forwarding of his portmanteau.</P>
<P>This was a method of travelling which he was accu&s;tomed to take; it &s;aved the trouble of provi&s;ion for any animal but him&s;elf, and left him at liberty to choo&s;e his quarters, either at an inn, or at the fir&s;t cottage in which he &s;aw a face he liked: nay, when he was not peculiarly attracted by the rea&s;onable creation, he would &s;ometimes con&s;ort with a &s;pecies of an inferior rank, and lay him|&s;elf down to &s;leep by the &s;ide of a rock, or on the banks of a rivu|let. He did few things without a motive, but his motives were ra|ther eccentric; and the u&s;eful and expedient were terms which he held to be very indefinite, and which therefore he did not always apply to the &s;en&s;e they are commonly under&s;tood in.</P>
<P>The &s;un was now in his decline, and the evening remarkably &s;e|rene, when he entered a hollow part of the road, which winded between the &s;urrounding banks, and &s;eamed the &s;ward in different lines, as the choice of travellers had directed them to tread it. It &s;eemed to be little frequented now, for &s;ome of the&s;e had partly recovered their former verdure. The &s;cene was &s;uch as induced Harley to &s;tand and enjoy it; when, turning round, his notice was attracted by an object, which the fixture of his eye on the &s;pot he walked had before prevented him from ob&s;erving.</P>
<P>An old man, who from his dre&s;s &s;eemed to have been a &s;oldier, lay fa&s;t a&s;leep on the ground; a knap&s;ack was re&s;ted on a &s;tone at his right hand, while his &s;taff and bra&s;s hilted &s;word were cro&s;&s;ed at his left.</P>
<P>Harley looked on him with the mo&s;t earne&s;t attention. He was one of tho&s;e figures which Salvator would have drawn; nor was the &s;urrounding &s;cenery unlike the wildne&s;s of that painter's back|grounds. The banks on each &s;ide were covered with fanta&s;tic &s;hrub-wood, and at a little di&s;tance, on the top of one of them, &s;tood a finger po&s;t, to mark the directions of two roads which di|verged from the point where it was placed. A rock, with &s;ome dangling wild flowers, jutted out above where the &s;oldier lay, on which grew the &s;tump of a large tree, white with age, and a &s;ingle twi&s;ted branch &s;haded his face as he &s;lept. His face had the marks of manly comeline&s;s impaired by time; his forehead was not altogether bald, but its hairs might have been numbered; while a few white locks behind cro&s;&s;ed the brown of his neck with a contra&s;t the mo&s;t venerable to a mind like Harley's.</P>
<P>"Thou art old, &s;aid he to him&s;elf, but age has not brought thee re&s;t for its infirmities; I fear the&s;e &s;ilver hairs have not found &s;helter from thy country, though that neck has been bronzed in its &s;ervice." The &s;tranger waked. He looked on Harley with the appearance of &s;ome confu&s;ion: it was a pain which he knew too well to think of cau&s;ing in another; he turned and went on. The old man re-adju&s;ted his knap&s;ack, and fellowed in one of the tracts on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the road.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="017579_0049_0FA12F2CAD4DDAC8">
When Harley heard the tread of his feet behind him, he could not help &s;tealing back a glance at his fellow-traveller. He &s;eem|ed to bend under the weight of his knap&s;ack: he halted on his walk, and one of his arms was &s;upported by a &s;ling, and lay mo|tionle&s;s acro&s;s his brea&s;t. He had that &s;teady look of &s;orrow which indicates that its owner has gazed upon his griefs till he has forgotten to lament them; yet not without tho&s;e &s;treaks of com|placency, which a good mind will &s;ometimes throw into the coun|tenance, through all the incumbent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of its depre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>He had now advanced nearer to Harley, and, with an uncertain &s;ort of voice, begged to know what it was o'clock; "I fear, &s;aid he, &s;leep has beguiled me of my time, and I &s;hall hardly have light enough left to carry me to the end of my journey." "Father! &s;aid Harley, (who by this time &s;ound the romantic enthu&s;ia&s;m ri|&s;ing within him) how far do you mean to go!" "But a little way, Sir, returned the other; and indeed it is but a little way I can manage now: it is ju&s;t four miles from the height to the vil|lage where I am going." "I am going there too, &s;aid Harley; we may make the road &s;horter to one another. You &s;eem to have &s;erved your country, Sir, to have &s;erved it hardly too; it is a cha|racter I have the highe&s;t e&s;teem for.&mdash;I would not be impertinently inqui&s;itive; but there is that in your appearance which excites my curio&s;ity to know &s;omething more of you: in the mean time &s;uffer me to carry that knap&s;ack."</P>
<P>The old man gazed on him; a tear &s;tood in his eye! "Young gentleman, &s;aid he, you are too good; may heaven ble&s;s you for an old man's &s;ake, who has nothing but his ble&s;&s;ing to give! but my knap&s;ack is &s;o familiar to my &s;houlders, that I &s;hould walk the wor&s;e for wanting it; and it would be trouble&s;ome to you, who have not been u&s;ed to its weight." "Far from it, an&s;wered Harley, I &s;hould tread the lighter; it would be the mo&s;t honourable badge I ever wore."</P>
<P>"Sir, &s;aid the &s;tranger, who had looked earne&s;tly in Harley's face during the la&s;t part of his di&s;cour&s;e, is not your name Harley?" "It is, replied he; I am a&s;hamed to &s;ay I have forgotten your's." "You may well have forgotten my face, &s;aid the &s;tranger, it is a long time &s;ince you &s;aw it; but po&s;&s;ibly you may remember &s;ome|thing of old Edwards."&mdash;"Edwards! cried Harley, Oh! heavens! and &s;prung to embrace him; let me cla&s;p tho&s;e knees on which I have &s;at &s;o often: Edwards!&mdash;I &s;hall never forget that fire &s;ide, round which I have been &s;o happy! But where, where have you been? where is Jack? where is your daughter? How has it fared with them, when fortune, I fear, has been &s;o unkind to you?"&mdash;"It is a long tale, replied Edwards; but I will try to tell it you as we walk.</P>
<P>"When you was at &s;chool in the neighbourhood, you remem|ber me at South-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that farm had been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by my father, grandfather, and great grandfather, which la&s;t was a younger brother of that very man's ance&s;tor who is now lord of the manor. I thought I managed it as they had done, with prudence; I paid
<PB N="46" REF="017579_0050_0FA12F2D6D935BC0">
my rent regularly as it became due, and had always as much be|hind as gave bread to me and my children. But my la&s;t lea&s;e was out &s;oon after you left that part of the country; and the &s;quire, who had lately got a London attorney for his &s;teward, would not renew it, becau&s;e, he &s;aid, he did not choo&s;e to have any farm under 300<HI>l.</HI> a year value on his e&s;tate; but offered to give me the preference on the &s;ame terms with another, if I choo&s;e to take the one he had marked out, of which mine was a part.</P>
<P>"What could I do, Mr. Harley? I feared the undertaking was too great for me; yet to leave, at my age, the hou&s;e I had lived in from my cradle! I could not, Mr. Harley, I could not; there was not a tree about it that I did not look on as my father, my brother, or my child: &s;o I even ran <HI>t</HI>he ri&s;que, and took the &s;quire's offer of the whole. But I had &s;oon rea&s;on to repent of my bargain: the &s;teward had taken care that my former farm &s;hould be the be&s;t land of the divi&s;ion: I was obliged to hire more &s;er|vants, and I could not have my eye over them all; &s;ome unfavour|able &s;ea&s;ons followed one another, and I found my affairs entang|ling on my hands.</P>
<P>"To add to my di&s;tre&s;s, a con&s;iderable corn-factor turned bank|rupt with a &s;um of mine in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: I failed paying my rent &s;o punctually as I was wont to do, and the &s;ame &s;teward had my &s;tock taken in execution in a few days after. So, Mr. Harley, there was an end of my pro&s;perity. However, there was as much produced from the &s;ale of my effects as paid my debts, and &s;aved me from a gaol: I thank God I wronged no man, and the world could never charge me with di&s;hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>"Had you &s;een us, Mr. Harley, when we were turned out of South-hill, I am &s;ure you would have wept at the &s;ight. You re|member old Tru&s;ty, my &s;hag hou&s;e&punc; dog; I &s;hall never forget it while I live; the poor creature was blind with age, and could &s;carce crawl after us to the door; he went however as far as the goo&s;eberry-bu&s;h; that you may remember &s;tood on the left hand of the yard; he was wont to ba&s;k in the &s;un there: when he had reached that &s;pot, he &s;topped; we went on: I called to him, he wagged his tail, but did not &s;tir: I called again; he lay down: I whi&s;tled, and cried Tru&s;ty, he gave a &s;hort howl, and died! I could have lain down and died too, but God gave me &s;trength to live for my children."</P>
<P>The old man now pau&s;ed a moment to take breath. He looked on Harley's face; it was bathed in 'tears: it was a tale he had been accu&s;tomed to think often on; he dropped one tear and no more.</P>

to &s;ucceed tolerably well, and&punc; lived contented on its produce, when an unlucky accident brought us under the di&s;plea&s;ure of a neighbouring ju&s;tice of the peace, and broke all our family happi|ne&s;s again.</P>
<P>"My &s;on was a remarkable good &s;hooter; he had always kept a pointer on our former farm, and thought no harm in doing &s;o now; when one day, having &s;prung a covey of birds on our own ground, the dog, of his own accord, followed them into the ju&s;|tice's. My &s;on laid down his gun, and went after his dog to bring him back: the game keeper, who had marked the birds, came up, and &s;eeing the pointer, &s;hot him ju&s;t as my &s;on approached. The creature fell; my &s;on ran up to him: he died with a complaining &s;ort of cry at his ma&s;ter's feet. Jack could bear it no longer; but flying at the game-keeper, wrenched his gun out of his hand, and with the butt-end of it felled him to the ground.</P>
<P>"He had &s;carce got home, when a con&s;table came with a war|rant, and dragged him to pri&s;on; there he lay, for the ju&s;tices would not take bail, till he was tried at the quarter-&s;e&s;&s;ions for the a&s;&s;ault and battery. His fine was ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d upon us to pay; we con|trived however to live the wor&s;e for it, and make up the lo&s;s by our frugality: but the ju&s;tice was not content with that puni&s;hment, and &s;oon after had an opportunity of puni&s;hing us indeed.</P>
<P>"An officer with pre&s;s-orders came down to our county, and having met with the ju&s;tices, agreed that they &s;hould pitch on a certain number, who could mo&s;t ea&s;ily be &s;pared from the county, whom he would take care to make it rid of: my &s;on's name was in the ju&s;tice's li&s;t.</P>
<P>"It was on a Chri&s;tmas-eve, and the birth-day too of my &s;on's little boy. The night was piercing cold, and it blew a &s;torm, with &s;howers of hail and &s;now. We had made up a cheering fire in an inner room; I &s;at before it in my wickerchair, ble&s;&s;ing Pro|vidence, that had &s;till left a &s;helter for me and my children. My &s;on's two little ones were holding their gambols around us; my heart warmed at the &s;ight; I brought a bottle of my be&s;t ale, and all our misfortunes were forgotten.</P>
<P>"It had long been our cu&s;tom to play a game at blind man's buff on that night, and it was not omitted now; &s;o to it we fell, I, and my &s;on, and his wife, the daughter of a neighbouring farmer, who happened to be with us at the time, the two children, and an old maid &s;ervant, that had lived with me from a child. The lot fell on my &s;on to be blindfolded: we had continued &s;ome time in our game, when he groped his way into an outer-room in pur|&s;uit of &s;ome of us, who, he imagined, had taken &s;helter there; we kept &s;nug in our places, and enjoyed his mi&s;take. He had not been long there, when he was &s;uddenly &s;eized from behind; "I &s;hall have you now," &s;aid he, and turned about. "Shall you &s;o, ma&s;ter, an&s;wered the ruffian who had laid hold of him; we &s;hall make you play at another &s;ort of game by and by."&mdash;At the&s;e words Harley &s;tarted with a convul&s;ive &s;ort of motion, and gra&s;p|ing

Edwards's &s;word, drew it half out of the &s;cabbard, with a look of the mo&s;t frantic wildne&s;s. Edwards gently replaced it in its &s;heath, and went on with his relation.</P>
<P>"On hearing the&s;e words in a &s;trange voice, we all ru&s;hed out to di&s;cover the cau&s;e; the room by this time was almo&s;t full of the gang. My daughter-in-law fainted at the &s;ight, the maid and I ran to a&s;&s;i&s;t her, while my poor &s;on remained motionle&s;s, gazing by turns on his children and their mother. We &s;oon recovered her to life, and begged her to retire and wait the i&s;&s;ue of the affair, but &s;he flew to her hu&s;band, and clung round him in an agony of grief and terror&punc;</P>
<P><HI>"Among&s;t the gang there was one of a &s;moother a&s;pect, whom, by his dre&s;s, we di&s;covered to be a &s;erjeant of foot: he came up to me, and told me, that my &s;on had his choice of the &s;ea or land &s;ervice, whi&s;per|ing at the &s;ame time, that if he choo&s;e the land, he might get off, on procuring him another man, and paying a certain &s;um for his freedom. The money we could ju&s;t mu&s;ter up in the hou&s;e, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the maid, who produced, in a green bag, all the little &s;avings of her &s;er|vice; but the man we could not expect to find. My daughter in&punc;law gazed upon her children with a look of the wilde&s;t de&s;pair: "My poor infants! &s;aid &s;he, your father is forced from you; who &s;hall now la|bour for your bread? or mu&s;t your mother beg for her&s;elf and you?" I prayed her to be patient; but comfort I had none to give her. At la&s;t, calling the &s;erjeant a&s;ide, I a&s;ked him, If I was too old to be ac|cepted of in place of my &s;on?" "Why, I don't know, &s;aid he; you are rather old to be &s;ure, but yet the money may do much." "I put the money in his hand; and coming back to my children, "Jack, &s;aid I, you are free; live to give your wife and the&s;e little ones bread; I will go, my child, in your &s;tead: I have but little life to lo&s;e, and if I &s;taid, &s;hould add one to the wretches you left behind."</HI></P>
<P><HI>"No, replied my &s;on, I am not that coward you imagine me; hea|ven forbid, that my father's grey hairs &s;hould be &s;o expo&s;ed, while</HI> I <HI>&s;at idle at home; I am young, and able to endure much, and God will take care of you and my family." "Jack, &s;aid I, I will put an end to this matter; you have never hitherto di&s;obeyed me; I will not be con|tradicted in this; &s;tay at home, I charge you, and, for my &s;ake, be kind to my children."</HI></P>
<P><HI>"Our parting, Mr. Harley, I cannot de&s;cribe to you; it was the fir&s;t time we had ever parted: the very pre&s;s gang could &s;carcely keep from tears; but the &s;erjeant, who had &s;eemed the &s;ofte&s;t before, was now the lea&s;t moved of them all. He conducted me to a party of new rai&s;ed recruits, who lay at village in the neighbourhood; and we &s;oon after joined the regiment. I had not been long with it, when we were ordered to the Ea&s;t Indies, where I was &s;oon made a &s;erjeant, and might have picked up &s;ome money, if my heart had been as hard as &s;ome others were; but my nature was never of that kind, that could think of making rich at the expence of my con&s;cience.</HI></P>
<P><HI>"Among&s;t our pri&s;oners was an old Indian, whom &s;ome of our officers &s;uppo&s;ed to have a trea&s;ure hidden &s;ome-where, which is not

an uncommon practice in that country. They pre&s;&s;ed him to di&s;cover it. He declared he had none; but that would not &s;atisfy them: &s;o they or|dered him to be tied to a &s;take, and &s;uffer fifty la&s;hes every morning, till he &s;hould learn to &s;peak out as they &s;aid. Oh! Mr. Harley, had you &s;een him, as I did, with his hands bound behind him, &s;uffering in &s;ilence, while the big drops trickled down his &s;hrivelled cheeks, and wet his grey beard which &s;ome of the inhuman &s;oldiers plucked in &s;corn! I could not bear it, I could not for my &s;oul; and one morning, when the re&s;t of the guard were out of the way, I found means to let him e&s;cape. I was tried by a court-martial for negligence of my po&s;t, and ordered, in compa&s;&s;ion of my age, and having got this wound in my arm, and that in my leg, in the &s;ervice, only to &s;uffer</HI> 300 <HI>la&s;hes, and be turned out of the regiment; but my &s;entence was mitigated as to the la&s;hes, and</HI> I <HI>only had</HI> 200.</P>
<P><HI>When I had &s;uffered the&s;e,</HI> I <HI>was turned out of the camp, and had betwixt three and four hundred miles to travel before I could reach a &s;ea-p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t, without guide to conduct me, or money to buy me provi&s;ions by the way.</HI> I <HI>&s;et out however, re&s;olved to walk as far as</HI> I <HI>could, and then to lay my&s;elf down and die.

When we parted, he pulled out a pur&s;e with two hundred pieces of gold in it: "Take this, &s;aid he, my dear pre&s;erver, it is all</HI> I <HI>have been able to procure."</HI></P>
<P>"I <HI>begged him not to bring him&s;elf to poverty for my &s;ake, who &s;hould probably have no need of it long;" but he in&s;i&s;ted o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> my accept|ing it.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXV. He mi&s;&s;es an old acquaintance.&mdash;An adventure con&s;equent upon it.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN they had arrived within a little way of the village they journeyed to, Harley &s;topped &s;hort, and looked &s;ted|fa&s;tly on the mouldering walls of a ruined hou&s;e that &s;tood on the road-&s;ide: "Oh heavens! he cried, what do I &s;ee! &s;ilent, un|roofed, and de&s;olate! Are all thy gay tenants gone; do I hear their hum no more; Edwards, look there, look there! the &s;cene of my infant joys, my earlie&s;t friend&s;hips, laid wa&s;te and ruin|ous! That was the very &s;chool where I was boarded when you were at South-hill: it is but a twelvemonth &s;ince I &s;aw it &s;tanding, and its benches filled with little cherubims: that oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the road was the green on which they &s;ported; &s;ee it now plough|ed up! I would have given fifty times its value to have &s;aved it from the &s;acrilege of that plow."</P>
<P>"Dear Sir, replied Edwards, perhaps they have left it from choice, and may have got another &s;pot as good." "They cannot, &s;aid Harley, they cannot; I &s;hall never &s;ee the &s;ward covered with its dai&s;ies, nor pre&s;&s;ed by the dance of the dear innocents: I &s;hall never &s;ee that &s;tump decked with the garlands which their little hands had gathered. The&s;e two long &s;tones which now lie at the foot of it, were once the &s;upports of a hut I my&s;elf a&s;&s;i&s;ted to rear: I have &s;at on the &s;ods within it, when we had &s;pread our banquet of apples before us, and been more ble&s;t.&mdash;Oh! Edwards! in|finitely more ble&s;t than ever I &s;hall be again."</P>
<P>Ju&s;t then a woman pa&s;&s;ed them on the road, and di&s;covered &s;ome &s;igns of wonder at the attitude of Harley, who &s;tood, with his hands folded together, looking with a moi&s;tened eye on the fallen pillars of the hut. He was too much intranced in thought to ob|&s;erve her at all; but Edwards civilly acco&s;ting her, de&s;ired to know, if that had not been the &s;chool-hou&s;e, and how it came into that condition they now &s;aw it in? "Alack a-day! &s;aid &s;he, it was the &s;chool-hou&s;e indeed; but to be &s;ure, Sir, the &s;quire has pulled it down, becau&s;e it &s;tood in the way of his pro&s;pects."&mdash;"What! how! pro&s;pects! pulled down! cried Harley."&mdash;Yes, to be &s;ure, Sir; and the green, where the children u&s;ed to play, he has ploughed up, becau&s;e, he &s;aid, they hurt his fence on the other &s;ide of it."&mdash;"Cur&s;es on his narrow heart, cried Harley, that could violate a right &s;o &s;acred! Heaven bla&s;t the wretch!
<Q><L><HI>" And from his derogate body never &s;pring</HI></L>
<L><HI>" A babe to honour him!"</HI>&mdash;</L></Q>
But I need not, Edwards, I need not, (recovering him&s;elf a little) he is cur&s;ed enough already: to him the noble&s;t &s;ource of happi|ne&s;s is denied; and the cares of his &s;ordid &s;oul &s;hall g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aw it, while

thou &s;itte&s;t over a brown cru&s;t, &s;miling on the&s;e mangled limbs that have &s;aved your &s;on and his children!" "If you want any thing with the &s;chool mi&s;tre&s;s, Sir, &s;aid the woman, I can &s;hew you the way to her hou&s;e." He followed her without knowing whither he went.</P>
<P>They &s;topped at the door of a &s;nug-looking hou&s;e, where &s;at an elderly woman with a boy and a girl before her, with each a &s;upper of bread and milk in their hands. "There, Sir, is the &s;chool-mi&s;tre&s;s."&mdash;"Madam, &s;aid Harley, was not an old venerable-looking man &s;chool-ma&s;ter here &s;ome time ago?" "Yes, Sir, he was; poor man! the lo&s;s of his former &s;chool-hou&s;e, I believe, broke his heart, for he died &s;oon after it was taken down; and as another has not yet been found, I have that charge in the mean time."&mdash;"And this boy and girl, I pre&s;ume, are your pupils?"&mdash;"Ay, Sir, they are poor orphans, put under my care by the pari&s;h; and more promi&s;ing children I never &s;aw." "Orphans!" &s;aid Harley. "Yes, Sir, of hone&s;t creditable parents as any in the pari&s;h; and it is a &s;hame for &s;ome folks to forget their relations, at a time when they have mo&s;t need to remember them."&mdash;"Madam, &s;aid Harley, let us never forget that we are all relati|ons." He ki&s;&s;ed the children.</P>
<P>"Their father, Sir, continued &s;he, was a farmer here in the neighbourhood, and a &s;ober indu&s;trious man he was; but nobody can help misfortunes; what with bad crops, and bad debts, which are wor&s;e, his affairs went to wreck, and both he and his wife died of broken hearts. And a &s;weet couple they were, Sir; there was not a properer man to look on in the county than John Ed|wards, and &s;o indeed were all the Edward&s;es." "What Edward|&s;es?" cried the old &s;oldier ha&s;tily "The Edward&s;es of South-hill; and a worthy family they were."&mdash;"South-hill!" &s;aid he in a languid voice, and fell back into the arms of the a&s;toni&s;hed Harley.</P>
<P>The &s;chool-mi&s;tre&s;s ran for &s;ome water, and a &s;melling-bottle, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of which they &s;oon recovered the unfortunate Edwards. He &s;tared wildly for &s;ome time, then folding his orphan grand-children in his arms, "Oh! my children, my children! he cried, have I found you thus? My poor Jack! art thou gone? I thought thou &s;houlde&s;t have carried thy father's grey hairs to the grave! And the&s;e little ones"&mdash;his tears choaked his utterance, and he fell again on the necks of the children.</P>
<P>"My dear old man! &s;aid Harley, Providence has &s;ent thee to relieve them; it will ble&s;s me, if I can be the means of a&s;&s;i&s;ting you."&mdash;"Yes indeed, Sir, an&s;wered the boy; father, when he was a|dying, bade God ble&s;s us; and prayed, that if grandfather lived, he might &s;end him to &s;upport us."&mdash;"Where did they lay my boy?" &s;aid Edwards. "In the Old Church-Yard, replied the woman, hard by his mother."&mdash;"I will &s;hew it you, an&s;wered the boy; for I have wept over it many a time, when fir&s;t I came a|mong&s;t &s;trange folks." He took the old man's hand, Harley laid
<PB N="52" REF="017579_0056_0FA12F336B95EDB0">
hold of his &s;i&s;ter's, and they walked in &s;ilence to the church-yard. There was an old &s;tone, with the corner broken off, and &s;ome letters, half covered with mo&s;s, to denote the names of the dead: there was a cyphered R. E. plainer than the re&s;t: it was the tomb they &s;ought.</P>
<P>"Here it is, grandfather," &s;aid the boy. Edwards gazed up|on it without uttering a word: the girl, who had only &s;ighed be|fore, now wept out-right; her brother &s;obbed, but he &s;tifled his &s;obbing. "I have told &s;i&s;ter, &s;aid he, that &s;he &s;hould not take it &s;o to heart; &s;he can knit already, and I &s;hall &s;oon be able to dig: we &s;hall not &s;tarve, &s;i&s;ter, indeed we &s;hall not, nor &s;hall grand|father neither."&mdash;The girl cried afre&s;h; Harley ki&s;&s;ed off her tears as they flowed, and wept between every ki&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVI. He returns home.&mdash;A de&s;cription of his retinue.</HEAD>
<P>IT was with &s;ome difficulty that Harley prevailed on the old man to leave the &s;pot where the remains of his &s;on were laid. At la&s;t, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;chool-mi&s;tre&s;s, he prevailed; and &s;he accommodated Edwards and him with beds in her hou&s;e, there being nothing like an inn nearer than the di&s;tance of &s;ome miles. In the morning, Harley per&s;uaded Edwards to come, with the children, to his hou&s;e, which was di&s;tant but a &s;hort day's journey.</P>
<P>The boy walked in his grand-father's hand; and the name of Edwards procured him a neighbouring farmer's hor&s;e, on which a &s;ervant mounted, with the girl &s;eated on a pillow before him.</P>
<P>With this train Harley returned to the abode of his fathers: and we cannot but think, that his enjoyment was as great as if he had arrived from the tour of Europe, with a Swi&s;s valet for his com|panion, and half a dozen &s;nuff-boxes, with invi&s;ible hinges, in his pocket. But we take our ideas from &s;ounds which folly has in|vented; Fa&s;hion, Bon-ton, and Vertu, are the names of certain idols, to which we &s;acrifice the genuine plea&s;ures of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oul: in this world of &s;emblance, we are contented with per&s;onating happi|ne&s;s; to feel it, is an art beyond us.</P>
<P>It was otherwi&s;e with Harley: he ran up &s;tairs to his aunt, with the hi&s;tory of his fellow-travellers glowing on his lips. His aunt was an oeconomi&s;t; but &s;he knew the plea&s;ure of doing charitable things, and withal was fond of her nephew, and &s;olicitous to oblige him. She received old Edwards therefore with a look of more complacency than is perhaps natural to maiden ladies of three|&s;core, and was remarkably attentive to his grand-children: &s;he roa&s;ted apples with her own hands for their &s;upper, and made up a little bed be&s;ide her own for the girl. Edwards made &s;ome at|tempts
<PB N="53" REF="017579_0057_0FA12F342BE59838">
towards an acknowledgment for the&s;e favours; but his young friend &s;topped them in their beginnings. "Who&s;oever re|ceiveth any of the&s;e children"&mdash;&s;aid his aunt; for her acquaint|ance with her bible was habitual.</P>
<P>Early next morning, Harley &s;tole into the room where Edwards lay: he expected to have found him a bed; but in this he was mi&s;|taken: the old man had ri&s;en, and was leaning over his &s;leeping grand&s;on, with the tears flowing down his checks. At fir&s;t he did not perceive Harley; when he did, he endeavoured to hide his grief, and cro&s;&s;ing his eyes with his hand, expre&s;&s;ed his &s;urpri&s;e at &s;eeing him &s;o early a&s;tir. "I was thinking of you, &s;aid Harley, and your children: I learned la&s;t night that a &s;mall farm of mine in the neighbourhood is now vacant; if you will occupy it, I &s;hall gain a good neighbour, and be able in &s;ome mea&s;ure to repay you the notice you took of me when a boy; and as the furniture of the hou&s;e is mine, it will be &s;o much trouble &s;aved." Edwards's tears gu&s;hed afre&s;h, and Harley led him to &s;ee the place he intended for him.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e upon this farm was indeed little better than a hut; its &s;ituation, however, was plea&s;ant, and Edwards, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the beneficence of Harley, &s;et about improving its neatne&s;s and con|venience. He &s;taked out a piece of the green before for a garden, and Peter, who acted in Harley's family as valet, butler, and gar|dener, had orders to furni&s;h him with parcels of the different &s;eeds he cho&s;e to &s;ow in it. I have &s;een his ma&s;ter at work in this little &s;pot, with his coat off, and his dibble in his hand: it was a &s;cene of tranquil virtue to have &s;topped an angel on his errands of mer|cy! Harley had contrived to lead a little bubbling brook through a green walk in the middle of the ground, upon which he had erect|ed a mill in miniature for the diver&s;ion of Edward's infant grand|&s;on, and made &s;hift in its con&s;truction to introduce a pliant bit of wood, that an&s;wered with its fairy clack to the murmuring of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ill that turned it. I have &s;een him &s;tand, li&s;tening to the&s;e min|gled &s;ounds, with his eye fixed on the boy, and the &s;mile of con|&s;cious &s;atisfaction on his cheek; while the old man, with a look half turned to Harley, and half to heaven, breathed an ejaculation of gratitude and piety.</P>
<P>Father of mercies! I al&s;o would thank thee! that not only ha&s;t thou a&s;&s;igned eternal rewards to virtue, but that, even in this bad world, the lines of our duty, and our happine&s;s, are &s;o frequently woven together.</P>

<P>They have drained the trea&s;uries of Nabobs, who mu&s;t fill them by oppre&s;&s;ing the indu&s;try of their &s;ubjects. Nor is this to be wondered at, when we con&s;ider the motive upon which th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e gen|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">men do not deny their going to India. The fame of conque&s;t, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">barous as that motive is, is but a &s;econdary con&s;ideration: there are certain &s;tations in wealth to which the warriors of the Ea&s;t a&s;pire. It is there indeed where the wi&s;hes of their friends a&s;&s;ign them eminence, where the que&s;tion of their country is pointed at their return. When &s;hall I &s;ee a commander return from India in the pride of honourable poverty?&mdash;You de&s;cribe the victories they have gained; they are &s;ullied by the cau&s;e in which they fought: you enumerate the &s;poils of the&s;e victories; they are covered with the blood of the vanqui&s;hed!</P>
<P>"Could you tell me of &s;ome conqueror giving peace and hap|pine&s;s to the conquered! did he accept the gifts of their princes to u&s;e them for the comfort of tho&s;e who&s;e fathers, &s;ons, or hu&s;|bands, fell in battle? did he u&s;e his power to gain &s;ecurity and freedom to the regions of oppre&s;&s;ion and &s;lavery? did he endear the Briti&s;h name by examples of genero&s;ity, which the mo&s;t deprav|ed are rarely able to re&s;i&s;t? did he return with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of duty di&s;charged to his country, and humanity to his fellow-creatures? did he return with no lace on his coat, no &s;laves in his retinue, no chariot at his door, and no Burgundy at his ta|ble?&mdash;the&s;e were laurels which princes might envy&mdash;which an hone&s;t man would not condemn!"</P>
<P>"Your maxims, Mr. Harley, are certainly right, &s;aid Edwards. I am not capable of arguing with you; but I imagine there are
<PB N="55" REF="017579_0059_0FA12F35B4F88FE8">
great temptations in a great degree of riches, which it is no ea&s;y matter to re&s;i&s;t: the&s;e a poor man like me cannot de&s;cribe, becau&s;e he never knew them; and perhaps I have rea&s;on to ble&s;s God that I never did; for then, it is likely, I &s;hould have with&s;tood them no better than my neighbours. For you know, Sir, that it is not the fa&s;hion now, as it was in former times, that I have read of in books, when your great generals died &s;o poor, that they did not leave wherewithal to buy them a coffin; and people thought the better of their memories for it: if they did &s;o now-a-days, I que&s;|tion if any body, except your&s;elf, and &s;ome few &s;uch, would thank them a whit."</P>
<P>"I am &s;orry, replied Harley, that there is &s;o much truth in what you &s;ay; but however the general current of opinion may point, the feelings are not yet lo&s;t that applaud benevolence, and cen&s;ure inhumanity. Let us endeavour to &s;trengthen them in our|&s;elves; and we, who live &s;eque&s;tered from the noi&s;e of the multi|tude, have better opportunities of li&s;tening undi&s;turbed to their voice."</P>
<P>They now approached the little dwelling of Edwards. A maid|&s;ervant, whom he had hired to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in caring for his grand-children, met them a little way from the hou&s;e: "There is a young lady within with the children," &s;aid &s;he. Edwards expre&s;|&s;ed his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> at the vi&s;it: it was however not the le&s;s true; and we mean to account for it.</P>
<P>This young lady then was no other than Mi&s;s Walton. She had heard the old man's hi&s;tory from Harley, as we have already re|lated. Curio&s;ity, or &s;ome other motive, prompted her to de&s;ire to &s;ee his grand-children: this &s;he had an opportunity of gratify|ing &s;oon, the children, in &s;ome of their walks, having &s;trolled as far as her father's avenue. She put &s;everal que&s;tions to both; &s;he was delighted with the &s;implicity of their an&s;wers, and promi&s;ed, that if they continued to be good children, and do as their grand|father bid them, &s;he would &s;oon &s;ee them again, and bring &s;ome pre&s;ent or other for their reward.</P>
<P>This promi&s;e &s;he had performed now: &s;he came attended only by her maid, and brought with her a complete &s;uit of green for the boy, and a chintz gown, a cap, and a &s;uit of ribbands, for his &s;i&s;ter. She had time enough, with her maid's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to equip them in their new habiliments before Harley and Edwards return|ed. The boy heard his grand-father's voice, and, with that &s;ilent joy which his pre&s;ent finery in&s;pired, ran to the door to meet him: and pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing one hand in his, with the other pointed to his &s;i&s;ter. "See, &s;aid he, what Mi&s;s Walton has brought us."&mdash;Edwards gazed on them.</P>
<P>Harley fixed his eye on Mi&s;s Walton; her's were turned to the ground;&mdash;in Edwards's there was a beamy moi&s;ture.&mdash;He folded his hands together&mdash;"I cannot &s;peak, young lady, &s;aid he, to thank you." Nor could Harley neither. There were a thou&s;and &s;entiments;&mdash;but they gu&s;hed &s;o impetuou&s;ly on his heart, that he could not utter a &s;yllable.&mdash;</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XL. The Man of Feeling jealous.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>de&s;ire of communicating knowledge or intelligence, is an ar|gument with tho&s;e who hold that man is naturally a &s;ocial animal. It is indeed one of the earlie&s;t propen&s;ities we di&s;cover; but it may be doubted whether the plea&s;ure (for plea&s;ure there certainly is) ari&s;ing from it be not often more &s;elfi&s;h than &s;ocial: for we frequently ob&s;erve the tidings of Ill communicated as eagerly as the annunciation of Good. Is it that we delight in ob&s;erving the effects of the &s;tronger pa&s;|&s;ions? for we are all philo&s;ophers in this re&s;pect; and it is perhaps among&s;t the &s;pectators at Tyburn that the mo&s;t genuine are to be found.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Was it from this motive that Peter came one morning into his ma&s;|ter's room with a meaning face of recital? His ma&s;ter indeed did not at fir&s;t ob&s;erve it; for he was &s;itting, with one &s;hoe buckled, bu&s;ied in delineating portraits in the fire. "I have bru&s;hed the&s;e clothes, Sir, as you ordered me."&mdash;Harley nodded his head; but Peter ob&s;erv|ed that his hat wanted bru&s;hing too: his ma&s;ter nodded again. At la&s;t Peter bethought him, that the fire needed &s;tirring; and, taking up the poker, demoli&s;hed the turband-head of a Saracen, while his ma&s;ter was &s;eeking out a body for it. "The morning is main cold, Sir," &s;aid Peter. "Is it?" &s;aid Harley. "Yes, Sir; I have been as far as Tom Dow&s;on's to fetch &s;ome barberries he had picked for Mrs. Margery. There was a rare junketing la&s;t night at Thomas's among Sir Harry Ben&s;on's &s;ervants: he lay at Squire Walton's, but he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ould not &s;uffer his &s;ervants to trouble the family; &s;o, to be &s;ure, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> all at Tom's, and had a fiddle and a hot &s;upper in the big room <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ere the ju&s;tices meet about the de&s;troying of hares and partridges, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> them things; and Tom's eyes looked &s;o red and &s;o bleared when I called him to get the barberries:&mdash;And I hear as how Sir Harry is going to be married to Mi&s;s Walton."&mdash;"How! Mi&s;s Walton mar|ried&punc;" &s;aid Harley. "why, it may not be true, Sir, for all that; but Tom's wife told it me, and to be &s;ure the &s;ervants told her, and their ma&s;ter told them, as I gue&s;s, Sir; but it may not be true for all that, as I &s;aid before."&mdash;"Have done with your idle information, &s;aid Harley:&mdash;Is my aunt come down into the parlour to breakfa&s;t?"&mdash;"Yes, Sir"&mdash;"Tell her I'll be with her immediately."&mdash;</HI></P>
<P><HI>When Peter was gone, he &s;tood with his eyes fixed on the ground, and the la&s;t words of his intelligence vibrating in his ears. "Mi&s;s Walton married!" he &s;ighed&mdash;and walked down &s;tairs, with his &s;ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> as it was, and the buckle in his hand. His aunt, however, was pretty well accu&s;tomed to the&s;e appearances of ab&s;ence; be&s;ides, that the natural gravity of her temper, which was commonly called into exertion by the care of her hou&s;ehold concerns, was &s;uch, as not ea&s;ily to be di&s;compo&s;ed by any circum&s;tance of accidental impropriety. She too had been informed of the intended match between Sir Harry Ben&s;on and Mi&s;s Walton. "I have been thinking, &s;aid &s;he, that they are
<PB N="57" REF="017579_0061_0FA12F38EF63D600">
di&s;tant relations; for the great grand-father of this Sir Harry Ben&s;on, who was knight of the &s;hir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the reign of Charles the Fir&s;t, and one of the cavaliers of tho&s;e times, was married to a daughter of the Wal|ton family." Harley an&s;wered drily, that it might be &s;o; but that he never troubled him&s;elf about the&s;e matters. "Indeed, &s;aid &s;he, you are to blame, nephew, for not knowing a little more of them: be|fore I was near your age, I ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ewed the pedigree of our family in a &s;et of chair bottoms, that were made a pre&s;ent of to my grand-mother, who was a very notable woman, and had a proper regard for gentili|ty, I'll a&s;&s;ure you; but now-a-days, it is money, not birth, that makes people re&s;pected; the more &s;hame for the times."</HI></P>
<P><HI>Harley was in no very good humour for entering into a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this que&s;tion; but he always entertained &s;o much parental re&s;pect for his aunt, as to attend to her di&s;cour&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><HI>"We blame the pride of the rich, &s;aid he; but are not we a&s;hamed of our poverty?"</HI></P>
<P>"Why, one would not choo&s;e, replied his aunt, to make a much wor&s;e figure than one's neighbours; but, as I was &s;aying before, the times (as my friend Mrs. Dorothy Walton ob&s;erves) are &s;hamefully degenerated in this re&s;pect. There was but the other day, at Mr. Walton's, that fat fellow's daughter, the Lon|don Merchant, as he calls him&s;elf, though I have heard that he was little better than the keeper of a chandler's &s;hop:&mdash;We were leaving the gentlemen to go to tea. She had a hoop for&s;ooth as large and as &s;tiff&mdash;and it &s;hewed a pair of bandy legs as thick as two&mdash;I was nearer the door by an apron's length, and the pert hu&s;&s;y bru&s;hed by me, as who &s;hould &s;ay, make way for your betters, and with one of her London bobs&mdash;but Mrs. Dorothy did not let her pa&s;s with it; for all the time of drinking tea, &s;he &s;poke of the precedency of family, and the di&s;parity there is between people who are come of &s;omething, and your mu&s;hroom-gentry who wear their coats of arms in their pur&s;es."</P>
<P>Her indignation was interrupted by the arrival of her maid with a dama&s;k table cloth, and a &s;et of napkins, from the loom, which had been &s;pun by her mi&s;tre&s;s's own hand. There was the family cre&s;t in each corner, and in the middle a view of the battle of Worce&s;ter, where one of her ance&s;tors had been a captain in the king's forces; and, with a &s;ort of poetical licen&s;e as to per&s;pective, there was &s;een the Royal Oak, with more wig than leaves on it.</P>
<P>All this the good lady was very copious on and took up the re|maining intervals of filling tea, to de&s;cribe its excellencies to Harley; adding, that &s;he intended this as a pre&s;ent for his wife, when he &s;hould get one. He &s;ighed and looked fooli&s;h, and com|mending the &s;erenity of the day, walked out into the garden.</P>
<P>He &s;at down on a little &s;eat which commanded an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect round the hou&s;e. He leaned on his hand, and &s;cored the ground with his &s;tick: "Mi&s;s Walton married! &s;aid he; but
<PB N="58" REF="017579_0062_0FA12F396F36CAC0">
what is that to me? May &s;he be happy! her virtues de&s;erve it; to me her marriage is otherwi&s;e indifferent:&mdash;I had romantic dreams! they are fled! it is perfectly indifferent."</P>
<P>Ju&s;t at that moment he &s;aw a &s;ervant, with a knot of ribbands in his ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, go into the hou&s;e. His cheeks grew flu&s;hed at the &s;ight! He kept his eye fixed for &s;ome time on the door by which he had entered, then &s;tarting to his feet, ha&s;tily followed him.</P>
<P>When he approached the door of the ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">en where he &s;uppo&s;ed the man had gone, his heart throbbed &s;o violently, that when he would have called Peter, his voice failed in the attempt. He &s;tood a moment li&s;tening in this breathle&s;s &s;tate of palpitation: Peter came out by chance. "Did your honour want any thing?"&mdash;"Where is the &s;ervant that came ju&s;t now from Mr. Walton's?"&mdash;"From Mr. Walton's, Sir! there is none of his &s;ervants here that I know of."&mdash;"Nor of Sir Harry Ben&s;on's?"&mdash;He did not wait for an an&s;wer; but having by this time ob&s;erved the hat with its party-coloured ornament hanging on a peg near the door, he pre&s;&s;ed forwards into the kitchen, and addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to a &s;trang|er whom he &s;aw there, a&s;ked him, with no &s;mall tremor in his voice, If he had any commands for him? The man looked &s;illy, and &s;aid, That he had nothing to trouble his honour with. "Are not you a &s;ervant of Sir Harry Ben&s;on's?"&mdash;"No, Sir."&mdash;"You'll pardon me, young man; I judged by the favour in your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">at."&mdash;"Sir, I am his maje&s;ty's &s;ervant, God ble&s;s him! and the&s;e fav|ours we always wear when we are recruiting."&mdash;</P>
<P>"Recruiting!" his eyes gli&s;tened at the word: he &s;eized the &s;oldier's hand, and &s;haking it violently, ordered Peter to fetch a bottle of his aunt's be&s;t d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">am. The bottle was brought: "You &s;hall drink the king's health, &s;aid Harley, in a bumper."&mdash;"The king and your honour."&mdash;"Nay, you &s;hall drink the king's health by it&s;elf; you may drink mine in another." Peter looked in his ma&s;ter's face, and filled with &s;ome little reluctance. "Now to your mi&s;tre&s;s." The man excu&s;ed him&s;elf&mdash;"to your mi&s;tre&s;s! you cannot refu&s;e it." It was Mrs. Margery's be&s;t dram! Peter &s;tood with the bottle a little inclined, but not &s;o as to di&s;|charge a drop of its contents: "Fill it, Peter, &s;aid his ma&s;ter, fill it to the brim." Peter filled it; and the &s;oldier having named Sukey Sim&s;on, di&s;patched it in a twinkling. "Thou art an hon|e&s;t fellow, &s;aid Harley, and I love thee;" and &s;haking his hand a|gain, de&s;ired Peter to make him his gue&s;t at dinner, and walked up into his room with a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ce much quicker and &s;pringy than u&s;ual. This agreeable di&s;appointment however he was not long &s;uffered to felicitate him&s;elf upon.</P>
<P>The curate happened that day to dine with him: his vi&s;its indeed were more properly to the aunt than the nephew; and ma|ny of the intelligent ladies in the pari&s;h, who, like &s;ome very great philo&s;ophers, have the happy knack at accounting for every thing, gave out, that there was a particular attachment between them, which wanted only to be maturated by &s;ome more years of court|&s;hip to end in the tendere&s;t connection.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="017579_0063_0FA12F3A2D9A06C8">
In this conclu&s;ion indeed, &s;uppo&s;ing the premi&s;es to have been true, they were &s;omewhat ju&s;tified by the known opinion of the lady, who frequently declared her&s;elf a friend to the <HI>etiquette</HI> of former times, when a lover might have &s;ighed &s;even years at his mi&s;tre&s;s's feet, before he was allowed the liberty of ki&s;&s;ing her hand. It is true Mrs. Margery was now about her grand climacteric; but that is nothing: for it is ju&s;t the age when we expect to grow younger. But I verily believe there was nothing in the report; the curate's connection was only as a genealogi&s;t; for in that &s;cience he was no ways inferior to Mrs. Margery her&s;elf. He dealt al&s;o in the pre&s;ent times; for he was a politician and a news-monger.</P>
<P>He had hardly &s;aid grace after dinner, when he told Mrs. Mar|gery, that &s;he might &s;oon expect a pair of white gloves, as Sir Harry Ben&s;on, he was very well informed, was ju&s;t going to be married to Mi&s;s Walton. Harley &s;pilt the wine he was carrying to his mouth: he had time however to recollect him&s;elf before the curate had fini&s;hed the different minutiae of his intelligence, and &s;ummoning up all the heroi&s;m he was ma&s;ter of, filled a bumper and drank to Mi&s;s Walton.</P>
<P>"With all my heart, &s;aid the curate, the bride that is to be." Harley would have &s;aid bride too; but the word Bride &s;tuck in his throat. His confu&s;ion indeed was manife&s;t: but the curate began to enter on &s;ome point of de&s;cent with Mrs. Margery, and Harley had very &s;oon after an opportunity of leaving them, while they were deeply engaged in a que&s;tion, whether the name of &s;ome great man in the time of Henry the Seventh was Richard or Hum|phrey.</P>
<P>He did not &s;ee his aunt again till &s;upper; the time between he &s;pent in walking, like &s;ome troubled gho&s;t, round the place where his trea&s;ure lay. He went as far as a little gate, that led into a cop&s;e near Mr. Walton's hou&s;e, to which that gentleman had been &s;o obliging us to let him have a key.</P>
<P>He had ju&s;t begun to open it, when he &s;aw, on a terra&s;s below, Mi&s;s Walton walking with a gentleman in a riding-dre&s;s, whom he immediately gue&s;&s;ed to be Sir Harry Ben&s;on. He &s;topped of a &s;udden; his hand &s;hook &s;o much that he could hardly turn the key; he opened the gate however, and advanced a few paces. The la|dy's lap-dog pricked up its ears, and barked: he &s;topped again.&mdash;
<Q><L>&mdash;<HI>" the little dogs and all,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Tray, Blanch, and Sweetheart, &s;ee they bark at me!"</HI></L></Q>
His re&s;olution failed; he &s;lunk back, and locking the gate as &s;oft|ly as he could, &s;tood on tiptoe looking over the wall till they were gone. At that in&s;tant a &s;hepherd blew his horn: the romantic melancholy of the &s;ound quite overcame him!&mdash;it was the very note that wanted to be touched&mdash;he &s;ighed! he dropped a tear!&mdash;and returned.</P>
<P>At &s;upper his aunt ob&s;erved that he was duller than u&s;ual; but &s;he did not &s;u&s;pect the cau&s;e: indeed it may &s;eem odd that &s;he was
<PB N="60" REF="017579_0064_0FA12F3AEC9763D8">
the only per&s;on in the family who had no &s;u&s;picion of his attach|ment to Mi&s;s Walton. It was frequently matter of di&s;cour&s;e a|mong&s;t the &s;ervants: perhaps her maiden coldne&s;s&mdash;but the&s;e things need not be accounted for.</P>
<P>In a day or two he was &s;o much ma&s;ter of him&s;elf as to be able to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hime upon the &s;ubject. The following pa&s;toral he left, &s;ome time after, on the handle of a tea-kettle, at a neighbouring hou&s;e where we were vi&s;iting; and as I filled the tea-pot after him, I happened to put it in my pocket by a &s;imilar act of forgetfulne&s;s. It is &s;uch as might be expected from a man who makes ver&s;es for amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>I am plea&s;ed with &s;omewhat of good-nature that runs through it, becau&s;e I have commonly ob&s;erved the writers of the&s;e com|plaints be&s;tow &s;ome epithets on their lo&s;t mi&s;tre&s;&s;es rather too har&s;h for the mere liberty of choice, which led them to prefer another to the poet him&s;elf: I do not doubt the vehemence of their pa&s;&s;ion; but alas! the &s;en&s;ations of love are &s;omething more than the re|turns of gratitude.</P>

<P>[At this place had the greate&s;t depredations of the curate began. There were &s;o very few connected pa&s;&s;ages of the &s;ub&s;equent chap|ters remaining, that even the partiality of an editor could not of|fer them to the public. I di&s;covered, from &s;ome &s;cattered &s;en|tences, that they were of much the &s;ame tenor with tho&s;e preced|ing; recitals of little adventures, in which the di&s;po&s;itions of a man, &s;en&s;ible to judge, and &s;till more warm to feel, had room to unfold them&s;elves. Some in&s;truction, and &s;ome example, I make no doubt, they contained; but it is likely that many of tho&s;e, whom chance hath led to a peru&s;al of what I have already pre&s;ented them with, may have read it with little plea&s;ure, and will feel no di&s;appointment from the want of tho&s;e parts which I have been unable to procure: to &s;uch as may have expected the intricacies of a novel, a few incidents in a life undi&s;tingui&s;hed, except by &s;ome features of the heart, cannot have afforded much entertainment.</P>
<P>Harley's own &s;tory, from the mutilated pa&s;&s;ages I have menti|oned, as well as from &s;ome inquiries I was at the trouble of making in the country, I found to have been &s;imple to exce&s;s. His mi&s;tre&s;s I could perceive was not married to Sir Harry Ben&s;on: but it would &s;eem, by one of the following chapters, which is &s;till entire, that Harley had not profited on the occa&s;ion by making any de|claration of his own pa&s;&s;ion, after tho&s;e of the other had been un&s;ucce&s;sful. The &s;tate of his health for &s;ome part of this period,

appears to have been &s;uch as to forbid any thoughts of that kind: he had been &s;eized with a very dangerous fever, catched by attend|ing old Edwards in one of an infectious kind.

<P>I have not, under the&s;e grey hairs, forgotten that I was once a young man, warm in the pur&s;uit of plea&s;ure, but meaning to be hone&s;t as well as happy.</P>
<P>I had ideas of virtue, of honour, of benevolence, which I had never been at the pains to define; but I felt my bo&s;om heave at the thoughts of them, and I made the mo&s;t delightful &s;oliloquies&mdash;It is impo&s;&s;ible, &s;aid I, that there can be half &s;o many rogues as they imagine.</P>
<P>"I travelled, becau&s;e it is the fa&s;hion for young men of my fortune to travel: I had a travelling tutor, which is the fa&s;hion too; but my tutor was a gentleman, which it is not always the fa&s;hion for tutors to be. His gentility indeed was all he had from his father, who&s;e prodigality had not left him a &s;hilling to &s;upport it.</P>
<P>"I have a favour to a&s;k you, my deard Mountford, &s;aid my father, which I will not be refu&s;ed: You have travelled as be|came a man; neither France nor Italy have made any thing of Mountford, which Mountford before he left England would have been a&s;hamed of: my &s;on Edward goes abroad, would you take him under your protection?"&mdash;He blu&s;hed&mdash;my father's face was &s;carlet&mdash;he pre&s;&s;ed his hand to his bo&s;om, as if he had &s;aid,&mdash;my heart does not mean to offend you.

on my Sedley."&mdash;"Dependance! an&s;wered my father; there can be no &s;uch word between us; what is there in 9000<HI>l.</HI> a year that &s;hould make me unworthy of Mountford's friend&s;hip!"&mdash;They embraced; and &s;oon after I &s;et out on my travels, with Mountford for my guardian.</P>
<P>"We were at Milan, where my father happened to have an Italian friend, to whom he had been of &s;ome &s;ervice in England. The count, for he was of quality, was &s;olicitous to return the obligation, by a particular attention to his &s;on: We lived in his palace, vi&s;ited with his family, were care&s;&s;ed by his friends, and I began to be &s;o well plea&s;ed with my entertainment, that I thought of England as of &s;ome foreign country.</P>
<P>"The count had a &s;on not much older than my&s;elf. At that age a friend is an ea&s;y acqui&s;ition: we were friends the fir&s;t night of our acquaintance.</P>
<P>"He introduced me into the company of a &s;et of young gentle|men, who&s;e fortunes gave them the command of plea&s;ure, and who&s;e inclinations incited them to the purcha&s;e. After having &s;pent &s;ome joyous evenings in their &s;ociety, it became a &s;ort of habit which I could not mi&s;s without unea&s;ine&s;s; and our meetings, which before were frequent, were now &s;tated and regular.</P>
<P>"Sometimes, in the pau&s;es of our mirth, gaming was intro|duced as an amu&s;ement: it was an art in which I was a notice; I received in&s;truction, as other novices do, by lo&s;ing pretty largely to my teachers. Nor was this the only evil which Mountford fore|&s;aw would ari&s;e from the connection I had formed; but a lecture of &s;our injunctions was not his method of reclaiming. He &s;ome|times a&s;ked me que&s;tions about the company; but they were &s;uch as the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">urio&s;ity of any indifferent man might have prompted: I told him of their wit, their eloquence, their warmth of friend&s;hip, and their &s;en&s;ibility of heart; "And their honour, &s;aid I, laying my hand on my brea&s;t, is unque&s;tionable." Mountford &s;eemed to rejoice at my good fortune, and begged that I would introduce him to their acquaintance. At the next meeting I introduced him ac|cordingly.</P>
<P>"The conver&s;ation was as animated as u&s;ual; they di&s;played all that &s;prightline&s;s and good humour which my prai&s;es had led Mountford to expect; &s;ubjects too of &s;entiment occurred, and their &s;peeches, particularly tho&s;e of our friend the &s;on of count Re|&s;pino, glowed with the warmth of honour, and &s;oftened into the tenderne&s;s of feeling.</P>
<P>"Mountford was charmed with his companions; when we part|ed he made the highe&s;t eulogiums in their commendation: "When &s;hall we &s;ee them again?" &s;aid he. I was delighted with the demand, and promi&s;ed to reconduct him on the morrow.</P>
<P>"In going to their place of rendezvous, he took me a little out of the road, to &s;ee, as he told me, the performances of a young &s;tatuary. When we were near the hou&s;e in which Mountford &s;aid
<PB N="66" REF="017579_0070_0FA12F3F6B6FB488">
he lived, a boy of about &s;even years old cro&s;&s;ed us in the &s;treet. At &s;ight of Mountford he &s;topped, and gra&s;ping his hand, My deare&s;t Sir, &s;aid he, my father is likely to do well; he will live to pray for you, and to ble&s;s you: yes, he will ble&s;s you, though you are an Engli&s;hman, and &s;ome other hard word that the monk talked of this morning which I have forgot, but it mea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> that you &s;hould not go to heaven; but he &s;hall go to heaven, &s;aid I, for he has &s;aved my father: come and &s;ee him, Sir, that we may be happy."&mdash;"My dear, I am engaged at pre&s;ent with this gentleman."&mdash;"But he &s;hall come along with you; he is an Engli&s;hman too, I fancy; he &s;hall come and learn how an Eng|li&s;hman may go to heaven.&mdash;Mountford &s;miled, and we followed the boy together.</P>
<P>"After cro&s;&s;ing the next &s;treet, we arrived at the gate of a pri|&s;on. I &s;eemed &s;urprized at the &s;ight; our little conductor ob&s;er|ved it." "Are you afraid, Sir? &s;aid he; I was afraid once too, but my father and mother are here, and I am never afraid when I am with them." He took my hand, and led me through a dar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> pa&s;&s;age that fronted the gate. When we came to a little door at the end, he tapped; a boy &s;till younger than him, opened it to receive us. Mountford entered with a look in which was pictured the benign a&s;&s;urance of a &s;uperior being. I followed in &s;ilence and amazement.</P>
<P>"On &s;omething like a bed, lay a man, with a face &s;eemingly emaciated with &s;ickne&s;s, and a look of patient dejection; a bundle of dirty &s;hreds &s;erved him for a pillow; but he had a better &s;up|port&mdash;the arm of a female who kneeled be&s;ide him, beautiful as an angel, but with a fading languor in her countenance, the &s;till life of melancholy, that &s;eemed to borrow its &s;hade from the object on which &s;he gazed.</P>
<P>There was a tear in her eye! the &s;ick man ki&s;&s;ed it off in its bud, &s;miling through the dimne&s;s of his own!&mdash;when &s;he &s;aw Mountford, &s;he crawled forward on the ground and cla&s;ped his knees; he rai&s;ed her from the floor; &s;he threw her arms round his neck, and &s;obbed out a &s;peech of thankfulne&s;s, eloquent beyond the power of language."</P>
<P>"Compo&s;e your&s;elf, my love, &s;aid the man on the bed; but he, who&s;e goodne&s;s has cau&s;ed that emotion, will pardon its effects."&mdash;"How is this, Mountford? &s;aid I; what do I &s;ee? what mu&s;t I do?"&mdash;"You &s;ee, replied the &s;tranger, a wretch, &s;unk in poverty, &s;tarving in pri&s;on, &s;tretched on a &s;ick bed! but that is little:&mdash;there are his wife and children, wanting the bread which he has not to give them! Yet you cannot ea&s;ily imagine the con&s;cious &s;erenity of his mind; in the gripe of affliction, his heart &s;wells with the pride of virtue! it can even look down with pity on the man who&s;e cruelty has wrung it almo&s;t to bur&s;ting. You are, I fancy, a friend of Mr. Mountford's; come nearer and I will tell you; for, &s;hort as my &s;tory is, I can hardly command breath enough for a recital. The &s;on of count Re&s;pino (I &s;tarted as if I

had trod on a vipe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">) has long had a criminal pa&s;&s;ion for my wife: this her prudence had concealed from me: but he had lately the boldne&s;s to declare it to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>"He promi&s;ed me affluence in exchange for honour; and threatened mi&s;ery, as its attendant, if I kept it. I treated him with the contempt he de&s;erved: the con&s;equence was, that he hired a couple of bravoes (for I am per&s;uaded they acted under his direction) who attempted to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate me in the &s;treet; but I made &s;uch a defence as obliged them to fly, after having given me two or three &s;tabs, none of which however were mortal. But his revenge was not thus to be di&s;appointed: in the little dealings of my trade I had contracted &s;ome debts, which he had made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of for my ruin; I was confined here at his &s;uit, when not yet recovered from the wounds I had received; that dear woman, and the&s;e two boys, followed me, that we might &s;tarve together; but Providence interpo&s;ed, and &s;ent Mr. Mountford to our &s;up|port: he was relieved my family from the gnawings of hunger, and re&s;cued me from death, to which a fever, con&s;equent on my wounds, and increa&s;ed by the want of every nece&s;&s;ary had nearly reduced me."</P>
<P>"Inhuman villain!" I exclaimed, lifting up my eyes to hea|ven. "Inhuman indeed! &s;aid the lovely woman who &s;tood at my &s;ide: Alas! Sir, what had we done to offend him? What had the&s;e little ones done, that they &s;hould peri&s;h in the toils of his vengeance?"&mdash;I reached a pen which &s;tood in an ink-&s;tandi&s;h at the bed-&s;ide&mdash;"May I a&s;k what is the amount of the &s;um for which you are impri&s;oned?"&mdash;"I was able, he replied, to pay all but 500 crowns."&mdash;I wrote a draught on the banker with whom I had a credit from my father for 2500, and pre&s;enting it to the &s;tranger's wife, "You will receive, Madam, on pre&s;enting this note, a &s;um more than &s;ufficient for your hu&s;band's di&s;charge; the remainder I leave for his indu&s;try to increa&s;e."

<HEAD>CHAP. LVI. The emotions of the heart.</HEAD>
<P>I <HI>Entered the room where his body lay; I approached it with reve|rence, not fear: I looked; the recollection of the pa&s;t crowded upon me. I &s;aw that form, which, but a little before, was animat|ed with a &s;oul which did honour to humanity, &s;tretched without &s;en&s;e or feeling before me. It is a connection we cannot ea&s;ily forget:&mdash;I took his hand in mine; I repeated his name involuntarily;&mdash;I felt a pul&s;e in every vein at the &s;ound.

<HEAD>THE CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>HE had hinted that he &s;hould like to be buried in a certain &s;pot near the grave of his mother. This is a weakne&s;s; but it is univer&s;ally incident to humanity: it is at lea&s;t a memorial for tho&s;e who &s;urvive: for &s;ome indeed a &s;lender memorial will &s;erve; and the &s;oft affections, when they are bu&s;y that way, will build their &s;tructures, were it but on the pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing of a nail.</P>
<P>He was buried in the place he had de&s;ired. It was &s;haded by an old <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the only one in the church-yard, in which there was a cavity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">orn by time.

There was &s;omething predictive in his look! perhaps it is fooli&s;h to remark it; but there are times and places when I am a child at the&s;e things.</P>
<P>I &s;ometimes vi&s;it his grave; I &s;it in the hollow of the tree. It is worth a thou&s;and homilies! every nobler feeling ri&s;es within me, every beat of my heart awakens a virtue!&mdash;but it will make you hate the world&mdash;No: their is &s;uch an air of gentlene&s;s around, that I can hate nothing; but, as to the world&mdash;I pity the men of it.</P>

<P>TO embelli&s;h with ta&s;te the compo&s;itions of genius, is a talent which Bou&s;&s;eau po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in a &s;uperior degree: Whether, declaiming in &s;trains of the mo&s;t &s;ublime eloquence, he walks the academic grove;&mdash;or, glowing with the enthu&s;ia&s;m of benevolence, he breaks a&s;under the &s;hackles of opinion;&mdash;or, &s;eizing with the eye of fancy the true and the beautiful, he draws, with the hand of a ma&s;ter, nature in all her &s;implicity and elegance, <Q>luxuriant yet mode&s;t, and true to virtue, though courted by the pa&s;&s;ions.</Q></P>

His theme is ST.

<P>HEROIC or familiar, pa&s;&s;ionate or tender, elegy admits of as much freedom and variety as any &s;pecies of poetry. How comes it then that authors of high e&s;timation complain that no kind of compo&s;ition, &s;ince the revival of letters, has been le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sfully cultivated?

Re&s;pecting the Notes annexed to the Poem, it may be proper to ob&s;erve, that ob&s;curity is highly incompatible with the chief object <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> poetry, which is, unque&s;tionably, to plea&s;e.

<P>AND re&s;pecting the title of the Poem (for, at this time, even that will not e&s;cape without &s;tricture) the author can only &s;ay, that the SENTIMENTAL SAILOR, hackney'd as the epithet may be thought of late to have been, appeared to him to give &s;ome &s;ort of idea of the nature of a performance which is not merely a love-elegy;&mdash;That had it been &s;o, he mu&s;t have little attended to the pe|culiar genius which characterizes the per&s;onage who&s;e &s;ingular &s;ituation is attempted to be de&s;cribed, marked as it is with &s;uch originality by the Promethean hand of Rou&s;&s;eau:&mdash;And, la&s;tly, that a title, however unhappily cho&s;en, can never detract from the merit of a Work, if indeed it has any.</P>
<P>IT has been &s;aid that the &s;tory of St. Preux and Eloi&s;a is ab&s;urd, excentric, impo&s;&s;ible. Let &s;uch critics however remember that love is not a cold and in&s;ipid galantry; but the &s;tronge&s;t, and when in de&s;pair, the mo&s;t terrible of all the pa&s;&s;ions; putting the &s;oul into tumults, and rai&s;ing, not unfrequently, dreadful tempe&s;ts in life; that under its powerful illu&s;ion the mind creates to it&s;elf another univer&s;e, filled with objects, and &s;urrounded with images that ex|i&s;t not but in imagination.&mdash;In fine, let them read the following beautiful pa&s;&s;age of an author, who&s;e knowledge of human nature will not be di&s;puted: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hi&s;t.

When it is agitated by a &s;torm, it has reached ve&s;&s;els at the di&s;tance of more than a Norway mile, where the crews have thought them&s;elves in perfect &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>PERHAPS it is hardly in the power of fancy to conceive a &s;itua|tion of more horror than of being thus driven forward, by the &s;ud|den violence of an impetuous torrent, to the vortex of a whirlpool, of which the noi&s;e and turbulence &s;till encrea&s;ing as it is approach|ed, are an earne&s;t of quick and inevitable de&s;truction; while the wretched victims in an agony of de&s;pair and terror, cry out for that help which they know to be impo&s;&s;ible, and &s;ee before them the dreadful aby&s;s into which they are about to be plunged and da&s;hed again&s;t the rocks at the bottom.</P>
<P>EVEN animals which have come too near to vortex have expre&s;|&s;ed the utmo&s;t terror when they find the &s;tream irre&s;i&s;tible. Whales are frequently carried away; and the moment they feel the force of the water, they &s;truggle again&s;t it with all their might, howling and bellowing in a frightful manner. The like happens frequent|ly to bears, who attempt to &s;wim to the i&s;land to prey upon the &s;heep.</P>
<P>IT is the opinion of Ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">cher that the Mael&s;trom is a &s;ea-vortex which attracts the flood under the &s;hore of Norway, and di&s;charges it again into the gulf of Bothnia: But this opinion is now known to be erroneous by the return of the &s;hattered fragments of what|ever happens to be &s;ucked down by it. The large &s;tems of fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s and pines ri&s;e again &s;o &s;hivered and &s;plintered, that the pieces look as if covered with bri&s;tles, The whole phenomena are the effects of the violence of the daily ebb and flood, occa&s;ioned by the contrac|tion of the &s;tream in its cour&s;e between the rocks."</P>

<HEAD>The ru&s;hing Mael&s;trom's dreadful noi&s;e I hear, Page 95. Line 22.</HEAD>
<P>"BESIDE the ebb and flood, there is a current or eddy in the Norway &s;ea called Mael&s;trom, or Mo&s;coe&s;trom. The i&s;land Mo&s;|coe, from whence this &s;tream derives its name, lies between the mountain He&s;leggin in Lofoden and the i&s;land Ver, which are a|bout one league di&s;tant; and between the i&s;land and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, on each &s;ide, the &s;tream makes its way. Between Mo&s;coe and Lofoden it is 400 fathoms deep; but between Mo&s;coe and Ver it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o &s;hal|low as not to afford pa&s;&s;age for a &s;mall &s;hip. When it is flood, the &s;tream runs up the country between Lofoden and Mo&s;coe with a hoi&s;terous rapidity; and when it is ebb, returns to the &s;ea, with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">olence and noi&s;e unequalled by the lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">de&s;t cataracts.

at the di&s;tance of many leagues, and forms a vortex, or whirlpool of great depth and extent, &s;o violent, that if a &s;hip come nea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> it, it is immediately drawn irre&s;i&s;tibly into the whirl, and then di&s;appears; being ab&s;orbed and carried down to the bottom in a moment, where it is da&s;hed to pieces again&s;t the rocks: and ju&s;t at the return of ebb and flood, when the water becomes &s;till for about a quarter of an hour, it ri&s;es again in &s;cattered fragments &s;carcely to be known for the parts of a &s;hip. When it is agitated by a &s;torm, it has reached ve&s;&s;els at the di&s;tance of more than a Norway mile, where the crews have thought them&s;elves in perfect &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>PERHAPS it is hardly in the power of fancy to conceive a &s;itua|tion of more horror than of being thus driven forward, by the &s;ud|den violence of an impetuous torrent, to the vortex of a whirlpool, of which the noi&s;e and turbulence &s;till encrea&s;ing as it is approach|ed, are an earne&s;t of quick and inevitable de&s;truction; while the wretched victims in an agony of de&s;pair and terror, cry out for that help which they know to be impo&s;&s;ible, and &s;ee before them the dreadful aby&s;s into which they are about to be plunged and da&s;hed again&s;t the rocks at the bottom.</P>
<P>EVEN animals which have come too near to vortex have expre&s;|&s;ed the utmo&s;t terror when they find the &s;tream irre&s;i&s;tible. Whales are frequently carried away; and the moment they feel the force of the water, they &s;truggle again&s;t it with all their might, howling and bellowing in a frightful manner. The like happens frequent|ly to bears, who attempt to &s;wim to the i&s;land to prey upon the &s;heep.</P>
<P>IT is the opinion of Ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">cher that the Mael&s;trom is a &s;ea-vortex which attracts the flood under the &s;hore of Norway, and di&s;charges it again into the gulf of Bothnia: But this opinion is now known to be erroneous by the return of the &s;hattered fragments of what|ever happens to be &s;ucked down by it.
