WHAT adds &s;omething to the terror na|turally conceived upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion, was the novelty of the offence, it being the fir&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the kind that we read of in hi&s;tory; and, therefore, not only more affecting to the murderer him&s;elf, but al&s;o to the beholders, who, from this fir&s;t outrage upon humanity, mu&s;t begin to look upon the world as a cur&s;ed habitation, having &s;uch a &s;pectacle before their eyes as man de&s;troying man&mdash;creatures the fir&s;t in dignity in the vi&s;ible creation, ju&s;t re|cent, as it were, from the hands of their Creator, and yet the one defeating the purpo&s;e of the other's being, and extin|gui&s;hing in his brother, and that brother's po&s;terity, a then con&s;iderable part of hu|man race.</P>
<P>WAS the fir&s;t &s;tate of nature then, a &s;tate of war? And men in &s;ingle &s;ettlements, and occupations, nece&s;&s;arily in a &s;tate of danger and enmity? Could religion do no|thing to prevent blood&s;hed?&mdash;And was the only remedy to be found for the&s;e evils the friendly &s;uccour of a community, and the additional power derived from a&s;&s;ociation, and a common-wealth?</P>
<P>THIS &s;hould &s;eem, by what is here re|lated, to have been the ca&s;e; and that in tho&s;e very early times the in&s;tinct of na|ture,
<PB N="7" REF="012773_0005_0F8A9368DB95DFD8">
a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the dawnings of rea&s;on, pointed out to men, that religion, unle&s;s it were genuine, could not of it&s;elf be de|pended upon as an in&s;trument of peace and quietne&s;s: But that the chief, if not the only public &s;ecurity for their per&s;ons, or property, was to be found in the whole|&s;ome laws of a good community, it ap|pearing from this hi&s;tory, that religion might be productive of divi&s;ions, and con|&s;equently of di&s;orders. For by what we can gather from hence, it &s;eems in one family to have been di&s;tingui&s;hed into two kinds, namely the religion of tho&s;e, who called them&s;elves the &s;ons of God, and the religion of tho&s;e were &s;tyled the &s;ons of men; of one of which &s;ects <HI>Abel</HI> was &s;up|po&s;ed to have been the head; and of the other <HI>Cain;</HI> and their opinions in this re|&s;pect mo&s;t likely oppo&s;ite: It being very evident from the relation of the fact, that it was &s;ome matter of religion, which had made the difference between the two brethern.</P>
<P>THE neutrals therefore (for &s;uch a party, there is rea&s;on from the context to believe there was) ob&s;erving, that though religion, when true and genuine, may be a &s;trong and natural obligation upon the wi&s;e and good, who &s;ee it's foundations, yet as it
<PB N="8" REF="012773_0006_0F8A93698715E378">
may be &s;ometimes fal&s;e in it&s;elf, and then attended with &s;uper&s;tition, enthu&s;ia&s;m, and per&s;ecution; at other times, though good in it's kind, yet a&s;&s;ented to only in appear|ance, and then delu&s;ive and hypocritical, not operating to good works, in which re&s;pect we find, that the religion of <HI>Cain,</HI> notwith&s;tanding his &s;acrifice, had been defective, they grew diffident of &s;uch a precarious in&s;urance for common hone&s;ty, choo&s;ing rather to &s;ecure them&s;elves by uniting in &s;ociety, building cities, and e&s;tabli&s;hing rules, and ordinances for the defence of their per&s;ons, and properties, and lodging a power in the hands of &s;ome public officers for upholding and main|taining the laws, which were to protect them.</P>
<P>FROM the regulations of &s;ome of the&s;e well ordered &s;ocieties, who by rea&s;on of the growing barbarity, and in&s;ecurity of the times, might be very vigilant again&s;t a fugitive, <HI>Cain</HI> &s;eems to have had the great|e&s;t apprehen&s;ion of danger&mdash;<HI>I &s;hall be a fugitive,</HI> &s;ays he <HI>and a vagabond in the earth, and it &s;hall come to pa&s;s that every one, that findeth me, &s;hall &s;lay me.</HI></P>
<P>THIS forlorn and re&s;tle&s;s condition of a fugitive, driven from place to place like a wild bea&s;t from the de&s;ert, and con&s;tantly
<PB N="9" REF="012773_0007_0F8A936A0CF7EE58">
denied reception, is no more than the na|tural con&s;equence of committing murder. The whole &s;pecies are alarmed at the ap|proach of &s;uch a mon&s;ter, they &s;hun him as a lion, that &s;pares no man in his rage, arm them&s;elves again&s;t him as a public enemy, that can neither be tru&s;ted nor re|claimed; and if they &s;lay him, think that they are doing God &s;ervice, by removing the common di&s;turber of the peace of man|kind.</P>
<P>CAIN, therefore, to avoid the dangers, which &s;urrounded him in the parts already inhabited, went and dwelt in the land of <HI>Nod,</HI> perhaps a de&s;ert, &s;o called from his wanderings, who&s;e &s;ituation at this pre&s;ent time is hard to be exactly determined. All that we are told of it is, that it lay to the ea&s;t of Eden, and &s;erved him for an hiding-place, till by time and recollection he could extricate him&s;elf from his pre&s;ent difficulties.</P>
<P>IN order to which, he forms an alliance by marriage, and, as the only place of &s;e|curity, builds a city of his own, and ga|thers his di&s;cendants into a community, after the example of the more regular part of the &s;pecies, who, as they are de&s;cribed in this chapter to have already put them|&s;elves

into a po&s;ture of defence, &s;eem to have been before-hand with him in this invention.</P>
<P>THUS much then being premi&s;ed con|cerning the natural hi&s;tory of mankind from their very origin: I &s;hall take occa|&s;ion, from a view of the polities of the&s;e early ages to prove.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> THAT (according to the laws of nature) the only cau&s;e or motive for form|ing &s;ocieties was in order to procure, by mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and friend&s;hip, a greater degree of comfort, &s;ecurity, and peace, than could be obtained in a &s;olitary, di&s;|united &s;tate.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> THAT murderers being guilty of oppo&s;ing and defeating the&s;e ends of &s;o|ciety, declare them&s;elves <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> to be public enemies; and con&s;equently, that <HI>every one, who findeth</HI> them has a <HI>right to &s;lay them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> THAT a chief magi&s;tate, or Go|vernor, refu&s;ing to execute that right for the &s;ubject, and oppo&s;ing him at the &s;ame time in the u&s;e of it, doth thereby di&s;&s;olve the original compact of the &s;tate; lo&s;es all title to the obedience of his people; and leaves them, as once, again in a &s;tate of nature, to take their own mea&s;ures, and &s;hift for them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="012773_0009_0F8A936B93E0FD40">
BUT fir&s;t, I am to prove, that the only cau&s;e or motive for forming &s;ocieties, was in order to procure, by mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance and friend&s;hip, a greater degree of comfort, &s;ecurity and peace, than could be obtained in a &s;olitary di&s;united &s;tate.</P>
<P>AND here, as almo&s;t all our appetites, pur&s;uits, and faculties, &s;peak &s;ome depen|dance on our fellow-creatures, or attach|ment to them, it might be taken for gran|ted, that man mu&s;t want much of the natu|ral happine&s;s, which God intented for him, and his own being requires, when he is excluded from &s;ociety.</P>
<P>'MORE things are nece&s;&s;ary,' &s;ays an excellent Philo&s;opher, <Q>to &s;u&s;tain life, or at lea&s;t to make it in any degree plea&s;ant and de&s;irable, than any one man can make or provide for him&s;elf, merely from his own labour and ingenuity. Meat, drink, cloathing and hou&s;e, and that frugal fur|niture which is ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite, with a little nece&s;&s;ary phy&s;ick, &s;uppo&s;e many arts and trades, many heads and many hands. If he could make a &s;hift in time of health, to live as a wild man under the covering of trees and rocks, feeding upon &s;uch fruits, herbs and roots, and other things, as the earth &s;hould afford in re|turn for his labour, or happen &s;pontane|ou&s;ly
<PB N="12" REF="012773_0010_0F8A936C44DA89D8">
to pre&s;ent him; yet what could he do in &s;ickne&s;s and old age, when he would not be able to &s;tir abroad, to collect the gifts of nature and enjoy her beneficence?</Q></P>
<P>THIS lonely and helple&s;s condition, plainly &s;hewing, that an union with his fel|low-creatures is extremely nece&s;&s;ary to the convenience and comfort of every human creature; I &s;hall lay down two maxims, which may &s;erve as principles to regulate that union, and render it &s;ub&s;ervient to human happine&s;s.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t is, that &s;ociety without benevo|lence can never pre&s;erve this union.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd, that &s;ociety without benevo|lence will make men more unhappy, than if they had never been at all united.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t ob&s;ervation is true. For it is not the forming them&s;elves into a body, that can keep men united. A collected number may be called a community, and while they remain together, they have the appearance of &s;uch: But if their be want|ing an union of hearts and affections, they want the e&s;&s;ence of &s;ociety. Like the par|ticles in a thread of &s;and, though they ap|pear to be together, they are really &s;epa|rate, and but one remove from di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>FOR men mu&s;t come together either upon
<PB N="13" REF="012773_0011_0F8A936D5262D150">
good de&s;igns to each other, or upon bad: The former not being here &s;uppo&s;ed, the latter mu&s;t take their place; and as bad de&s;igns can have nothing for their object but hurt or de&s;truction, with either of the&s;e &s;ociety cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>FOR if the fir&s;t formers of human &s;ociety when herded with &s;avages, removed from among&s;t them with a view to &s;ecurity and better treatment, and mi&s;&s;ed of their aim, finding no better accommodation than they left, does not the cau&s;e &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t, why they &s;hould remove again? The &s;ame &s;avage principles remaining, of unbounded &s;elf-intere&s;t, and rapine, will produce the &s;ame &s;avage actions; defeat the end of the new &s;ociety, and drive them for ever to other &s;ettlements, but never pre&s;erve them in any.</P>
<P>BECAUSE &s;uch principles mu&s;t occa&s;ion continual &s;truggles and convul&s;ions, and fill the world with acts of violence and in|ju&s;tice, the &s;trong &s;till oppre&s;&s;ing and de|vouring the weak. The con&s;equence of which mu&s;t be broils, and blood&s;hed in particular rencounters; or a general civil war; or el&s;e a lingering declen&s;ion of the &s;tate, the weake&s;t members decaying fir&s;t.</P>
<P>NOT that the di&s;ea&s;e will &s;top, with the lo&s;s of the&s;e; the few, who &s;urvived the
<PB N="14" REF="012773_0012_0F8A936DF591FD40">
pillage and de&s;truction of their fellow-creatures, through dread and jealou&s;y of each other, mu&s;t be forced to &s;eparate, &s;ecuring them&s;elves, as they can, again&s;t the attacks of that uncharitable cruel tem|per, which le&s;&s;ened their number at the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>UPON this &s;tate of mi&s;ery and confu&s;ion which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily en&s;ue when a com|munity is broken up, by the unnatural conduct of it's members in not pur&s;uing the welfare of the whole, but their private animo&s;ities, and private intere&s;ts, I cannot but make my &s;econd ob&s;ervation, in effect to this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>II. THAT the unfortunate people, who were led to compo&s;e &s;uch a &s;ociety, are made more unhappy by their conjunction, than if they had never been united.</P>
<P>FOR the real end of &s;ociety being mu|tual help and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, people who come into it, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with &s;uch a fond and hone&s;t notion, are apt to require &s;omething more to their &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, than a cloath|ing of &s;kins, and the roots, and herbs, of an hermit: Being now con&s;orted, as they think, with rea&s;onable creatures, and not among&s;t the bea&s;ts of the field, they natural|ly expect more from them, than from &s;a|vages, and have made their happine&s;s de|pend, in great mea&s;ure, as in &s;ocieties it
<PB N="15" REF="012773_0013_0F8A93731270E2E0">
nece&s;&s;arily mu&s;t, upon the good offices they are to receive from others; but the want of charity, &s;tops all interchange of kindne&s;s, and reduces them to a wor&s;e &s;tate than that of the hermit, who being bred to mi&s;ery, never expected any one's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, while the&s;e in a ju&s;t hope of help from their fellow-creatures are lamentably lo&s;t, like the Mariner, who peri&s;hes in the &s;ight of &s;hore, within the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his friends.</P>
<P>IT is this di&s;appointment of expected help that doubles the &s;orrowful &s;ighing of the pri&s;oners, that provokes afre&s;h the wi|dow's tears, and orphan's cries, that deep|ens the groans of the mi&s;erable, and adds a more piercing accent to all their com|plaints.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e, and &s;uch like circum&s;tances, when people find all hopes of &s;uccour from mankind eluded, and withal receive griev|ous injuries from others, which they could never have received from them&s;elves; it is no wonder that they grew weary of their own &s;pecies, and prefer &s;olitude to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>IT is upon the&s;e occa&s;ions that we read in hi&s;tory of the &s;eparation of particular per&s;ons, and &s;ometimes of the &s;ece&s;&s;ion of an whole multitude.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="012773_0014_0F8A9373C5289650">
THUS, for in&s;tance, <HI>Timon,</HI> the hone&s;t <HI>Athenian,</HI> who&s;e love of ju&s;tice and plain dealing had led him into many a &s;nare in his intercour&s;e with a corrupt, deceitful, rotten-hearted people, and who&s;e re&s;ent|ment upon that account acquired him the name of the man-hater, after he had been long credulous and benevolent to his own hurt, retired at length from the generation of vipers, and left them to &s;ting each other.</P>
<P>AND thus, in the fir&s;t period of the Ro|man common-wealth, the commons, op|pre&s;&s;ed and wounded to the heart by in|juries, came to a determination to break up the &s;tate, and to leave the city; which revolution would certainly have taken place, had they not been &s;oothed by the temper and &s;agacity of <HI>Agrippa,</HI> and lured by the promi&s;es of better u&s;age.</P>
<P>SUCH pa&s;&s;ages as the&s;e are recorded in hi&s;tory, and where that has been &s;ilent, the dens and caves of the earth, the monu|ments of inhumanity in &s;avage countries, are a te&s;timony to the world, that people look upon a &s;tate of &s;olitude, however contrary to the proper &s;tate of human na|ture, to be yet a better condition than they can expect to find in a bad &s;ociety.</P>
<P>AND yet it has been ob&s;erved before, from the &s;ituation and pur&s;uits of men,
<PB N="17" REF="012773_0015_0F8A93749C73C870">
that he is a &s;ocial creature: Of con&s;e|quence, without &s;ome union and inter|cour&s;e with his fellow-creatures, his life mu&s;t be very de&s;titute and very mi&s;erable. The &s;um of the matter then is this, that if you take away affection from mankind, let them live how they will, they mu&s;t live in mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>II. But what I have hitherto advanced is only a &s;tep towards the proof of my &s;e|cond propo&s;ition, touching the legality of killing murderers:</P>
<P>FOR if &s;ociety cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without common friend&s;hip; how much le&s;s can it &s;ub&s;i&s;t, if it harbour in it common enemies?</P>
<P>THE matters urged in proof of my fir&s;t propo&s;ition plainly &s;hew, that the end and de&s;ign of forming &s;ocieties, was for the &s;ake of procuring a greater degree of com|fort, &s;ecurity, and peace:</P>
<P>BUT murderers, being guilty of oppo|&s;ing and defeating all the&s;e ends, declare them&s;elves <HI>ip&s;o facto,</HI> or by the very deed, to be public enemies: Therefore, as every member of a community is intere&s;ted in the public peace, his own being bound up, and included in that of the public, it fol|lows, that every member of a community has a right to &s;lay a murderer.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="012773_0016_0F8A937549FAC770">
AND that the ancient practice &s;upported people in this right, may be plainly ga|thered from the conver&s;ation of <HI>Cain,</HI> and GOD's reply to it, as a thing e&s;tabli&s;hed&mdash;'therefore,' &s;ays he, (i. e.) <Q>becau&s;e the thing is &s;o, as you repre&s;ent it; that, by common cu&s;tom of the world, <HI>every one may kill you, that meets you,</HI> I will inter|po&s;e my authority; and, by puni&s;hing you in my own way, that is, by &s;etting as a mark, my cur&s;e upon you, I will take the execution of vengeance upon my&s;elf.</Q> The vengeance you &s;ee was due, and in the common cour&s;e of things would certainly have been executed in the u&s;ual manner, but for the interpo&s;ition of divine authority.</P>
<P>FOR by the law of nature, no human law|giver or ruler can remit the earthly or tempo|ral puni&s;hment due to murder, unle&s;s &s;o im|powered by an act of the whole community; or &s;creen an offender of that &s;ort, if any one individual demand his puni&s;hment, for the rea&s;ons before produced. Becau&s;e a mur|derer is a public enemy, that is, an enemy to every individual, as well as to the com|munity. To demon&s;trate this more par|ticularly&mdash;It appears from what has been &s;aid, that the end and de&s;ign of &s;ociety is to procure to mankind, by mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance and friend&s;hip, a greater degree of &s;ecurity,
<PB N="19" REF="012773_0017_0F8A937610143DD0">
peace and comfort, than in a &s;olitary &s;tate they could expect to po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>WHOSOEVER, therefore, by his actions &s;hall declare him&s;elf an enemy to tho&s;e ends, doth at the &s;ame time declare him&s;elf a public enemy: For he is an enemy to the public tranquility.</P>
<P>THIS character may be ju&s;tly fixed upon a man, not only when he di&s;turbs a multitude at once; but even when he makes an attack upon a &s;ingle per&s;on; if that attack be &s;uch as deprives a per&s;on of his being, or even of his well-being. For it makes &s;ociety no lon|ger a place of &s;ecurity; and therefore it puts every individual into the &s;ame &s;tate of dan|ger; though real de&s;truction may as yet have affected but few. In this general alarm, then, or appearance of danger, every man has a right to put him&s;elf into a &s;tate of defence; and as his own &s;ecurity is inclu|ded in that of the public; to oppo&s;e and de&s;troy that object, which puts his own &s;ecu|rity to the hazard by di&s;turbing the public peace.</P>
<P>HE has a right therefore, to de&s;troy a mur|derder for de&s;troying the public &s;ecurity: Becau&s;e an attempt of that &s;ort in de&s;troy|ing his own &s;ecurity, as a private man, the ca&s;e is alarming to every individual, as well as of the body politic: And therefore, be|&s;ide

the power of acting in conjunction with the community, as in other ca&s;es, again&s;t a public enemy; he has a right in this ca&s;e, to oppo&s;e the public enemy, as a &s;ingle man; which is a privilege, which he enjoys by the right of &s;elf defence.</P>
<P>To deny, that a man is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch a power as this, is only the doctrine of ty|rants and traitors, who&s;e crime no puni&s;h|ment can equal, and who ought to be ex|terminated from the face of the earth.</P>
<P>IT is to a&s;&s;ert, &s;ays an excellent writer up|on the religion of nature, contrary to truth, that a man either has not the faculties and powers, which he actually has, for his defence, or that the author of nature has given them to him in vain. For to what end does he po&s;&s;e&s;s them, if he may not u&s;e them? And how may he u&s;e them, if not to his own pre&s;ervation, when he is attacked, and abu&s;ed, and perhaps in dan|ger of being de&s;troyed?</P>
<P>IF a man has no right to defend him|&s;elf again&s;t in&s;ults, pain, and death; it mu&s;t be becau&s;e the aggre&s;&s;or has a right to a&s;&s;ail him, and to u&s;urp a power over him, and what is his; but this preten&s;ion, where a man is not an offender, is pre|vented by the notion of property; every man has &s;omething, which is truly his&mdash;
<PB N="21" REF="012773_0019_0F8A937797E0E270">
His life and limbs for in&s;tance, and let us for the pre&s;ent only &s;uppo&s;e, that there may be more. And as men in a &s;tate of nature, are allowed by all Civilians to have been born equal, no man has a right to hurt another's property, or interrupt his hap|pine&s;s; but if a man may not defend him&s;elf, it &s;uppo&s;es that the other has that right, which includes a great ab&s;urdity, namely, a licence to commence an injury, or begin a violence, which is in nature a more unrea&s;onable demand, than only a licence to repel it.</P>
<P>FOR he who begins is the true cau&s;e of all that follows, and whatever falls upon him from the oppo&s;ition made by the de|fending party, is but the effect of his own act: Or the violence, of which he is the author, reflected back upon him&s;elf.</P>
<P>AND with regard to &s;ociety, &s;ince he who begins to violate the happine&s;s of another does what is wrong; we may be &s;ure, that he who endeavours to obviate or put a &s;top to that violence, in that re&s;pect does what is right;&mdash;right, I &s;ay, with re&s;pect to the community.</P>
<P>FOR with regard to him&s;elf, &s;ince every man is obliged to con&s;ult his own happine&s;s, there can be no doubt but that he not only may, but even ought to defend it.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="012773_0020_0F8A937849DE7958">
OTHERWISE he will fail in his duty to him&s;elf, and deny that his happine&s;s is his happine&s;s, or which is the &s;ame thing, &s;uf|fer what &s;hould be his happine&s;s, by the malice of others, to become his mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>THIS right of &s;elf-defence then may al|ways be exerted upon the apprehen&s;ion of danger, and therefore the appearance of danger will always give a man ju&s;t cau&s;e to exert it.</P>
<P>I AM not to &s;tay, &s;ays an excellent Civilian, till a man &s;hall actually begin to make an attack upon my per&s;on; or be|tray my own &s;afety &s;o far, as to &s;uffer him by my negligence to take &s;uch advantages, as may effect my own ruin.</P>
<P>WE do not know how &s;oon, a per&s;on, who has done a thing once, may do it again, he has declared him&s;elf to be a dan|gerous creature, an enemy to man, by kil|ling a man. It is enough then that he awakens our &s;u&s;picions, in &s;uch a manner, as to put us in fear of our lives. When this fear commences, the time of action commences again&s;t an adver&s;ary. And therefore, when it is reported, that a mur|derer infe&s;ts &s;ociety, we may immediately proceed to act again&s;t him, if he come in our way.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="012773_0021_0F8A93798399D448">
BECAUSE his is a character, that always rai&s;es a &s;u&s;picion of our being hurt: We are by no means certain, but that he may immediately give fre&s;h proofs of his wick|ed temper, by effecting our own de&s;tructi|on; and therefore, at the very moment, that the&s;e fears ari&s;e, and his approach to our per&s;ons makes him dangerous, that very moment, as he has forfeited all pro|tection from civil &s;ociety, and is as little to be tru&s;ted, as a per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by canine madne&s;s&mdash;that very moment he may be de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>AND whenever the laws of any parti|cular country are deficient in this re&s;pect and come not in to the aid of the law of nature, in matters of &s;uch importance as the immediate danger of lo&s;ing a life, that country is not fit to be any longer our place of re&s;idence; &s;ince the laws are not able to protect the &s;ubject in the article of per&s;onal &s;afety, and &s;elf-defence, and, therefore, no longer worthy of his &s;ub|jection or regard.</P>
<P>III. Having thus clearly demon&s;trated from principles and maxims undeniably true, that every man has by the law of na|ture an unalienable right to &s;lay a mur|derer, becau&s;e a murderer is a public ene|my, dangerous to the peace and &s;afety of
<PB N="24" REF="012773_0022_0F8A9379FAA64840">
the community, and therefore to his own peace; my la&s;t ob&s;ervation touching the concurrence of the laws upon &s;uch an oc|ca&s;ion will lead me to the third thing pro|po&s;ed, which was to con&s;ider more minute|ly, what aid an individual may expect from the public in &s;upport of &s;uch a right; where I believe it will appear;</P>
<P>"THAT a Chief-magi&s;trate or Governor refu&s;ing to exerci&s;e that right, for the &s;ub|ject, and at the &s;ame time denying him the privilege of u&s;ing it for him&s;elf, doth there|by di&s;&s;olve the original compact of the &s;tate; lo&s;es all title to the obedience of his people; and leaves them, as once, again in a &s;tate of nature, to take their own mea|&s;ures, and to &s;hift for them&s;elves."</P>
<P>FOR though, upon entering into &s;ociety men may, for convenience, (and conveni|ence we &s;ee is the end of coming into &s;o|ciety) lodge or depo&s;it this right in the hands of others, yet it is occa&s;ionally re|&s;umable, and only depo&s;ited in tru&s;t.</P>
<P>"A man (&s;ays my Author) may part with &s;ome of his natural rights, and put him&s;elf under the government of laws, and of tho&s;e (people) who in their &s;everal &s;tations are entru&s;ted with the execution of them, in order to gain their protection, and the privileges of a regular &s;ociety:&mdash;But if the
<PB N="25" REF="012773_0023_0F8A937BDB15AB88">
que&s;tion be a&s;ked&mdash;what natural rights a man may part with, or how far he may part with them? The general an&s;wer, I think, may be this: Some things are e&s;|&s;ential to our being&mdash;(and therefore not to be parted with)&mdash;and &s;ome it is in our power to part with.&mdash;From &s;uch as the&s;e then we may recede, as far as is con&s;i&s;tent with the end, for which we do it&mdash;and not further."&mdash;For in&s;tance, &s;uppo&s;e our end be &s;afety, we cannot then convey away the means of &s;afety &s;o far as to lo&s;e that end. For this would be a contradiction.</P>
<P>EVERY member of a community has a right to &s;afety: He enters into &s;ociety, with the view to &s;ecure that right, and the &s;tipulations and engagements on the part of the magi&s;tracy, to fulfil the laws and compacts of the country, are always under|&s;tood, by the very nature of civil compacts, to be a &s;ecurity for the &s;ame.</P>
<P>EVERY civil government, therefore, to a &s;ubject, who is not a criminal, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be an A&s;ylum, or place of &s;afety: For otherwi&s;e it contradicts the very end and de&s;ign of civil government. That is, it is a contradiction to it&s;elf.</P>
<P>BUT no nation can be a place of &s;afety, where the government avowedly harbours
<PB N="26" REF="012773_0024_0F8A937C03384F70">
murderers; and in defiance of law and ju&s;tice per&s;i&s;ts in the act: Becau&s;e in this ca&s;e they are per&s;i&s;ting in that, which mu&s;t de&s;troy all &s;afety. Since murder and &s;afe|ty are directly oppo&s;ites, the one implying the &s;ecurity of a man, the other his de|&s;truction; and, therefore, they mutually expel each other.</P>
<P>SUCH a government then acts contrary to the ends and purpo&s;es of &s;ociety: And, therefore, if &s;uch a government cannot be altered or di&s;&s;olved it mu&s;t de&s;troy &s;ociety: To avoid which con&s;equence, &s;ociety has a right,&mdash;1<HI>&s;t,</HI> to alter that government&mdash;and if that cannot be effected by fair means&mdash;then 2<HI>dly,</HI> to di&s;&s;olve it&mdash;and <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> if that be not in their power&mdash;the members have then a right to for&s;ake &s;uch a &s;ociety, and &s;hift for them&s;elves.&mdash;</P>
<P>OF the&s;e in their order&mdash;</P>
<P>AND 1<HI>&s;t.</HI> Upon &s;uppo&s;ition, that a go|vernment &s;hould act contrary to the ends and purpo&s;es of &s;ociety, as in the afore|&s;aid ca&s;e of murder, individuals have a right to alter that government.</P>
<P>FOR they have been deceived in the exe|cution of the compact. They entered in|to &s;ociety in order to have their &s;everal properties a&s;certained, and to be quiet in
<PB N="27" REF="012773_0025_0F8A937E0566BC78">
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them; e&s;pecially in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that, which is the greate&s;t of all, and the foundation of all other pro|perties, the property which they have in their own lives.</P>
<P>THEY may remon&s;trate then again&s;t a deception of this high nature and con&s;e|quence, as a breach of contract, and de|mand an alteration in the mea&s;ures of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>IF the parties, who form the government refu&s;e to comply with the demand, and per&s;i&s;t in the denial, they bring on the &s;e|cond ca&s;e; and by turning the power of the government again&s;t the individual, which &s;hould have been for his protection, they give the individual a right to de&s;troy that government.</P>
<P>AND this upon the &s;ame principle of &s;elf-defence, that authori&s;es him to de&s;troy a &s;ingle man.</P>
<P>FOR if a man cannot part with his right of &s;elf-defence again&s;t a &s;ingle murderer, he cannot (<HI>a fortiori</HI>) part with his right of &s;elf-defence again&s;t a combination of murderers; but a government combining with murderers is a combination of mur|derers; therefore a greater nui&s;ance, an object far more dangerous, as con&s;i&s;ting of
<PB N="28" REF="012773_0026_0F8A937FDA34B5B0">
a greater number, and for that rea&s;on, it he can compa&s;s it, the more worthy to be de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>"THIS rea&s;on is deci&s;ive, &s;ays profe&s;|&s;or <HI>Barbeyrac,</HI> and &s;ufficient to refute the opinion of tho&s;e, who pretend, as does <HI>Grotius</HI> for one, (in his <HI>Jure Belli et Pacis</HI> Lib. II. Cap. 1 &sect;. 9.) that the right of a ju&s;t defence of one's-&s;elf cea&s;es, when the unju&s;t aggre&s;&s;or is a prince, or &s;ome other per&s;on inve&s;ted with authority in civil &s;o|ciety. So far from it, that the moment a magi&s;trate, or a &s;uperior, let him be what he will, carries him&s;elf maliciou&s;ly, and from deliberate choice, to &s;uch an exce&s;s of madne&s;s, he puts him&s;elf in a &s;tate of war with tho&s;e, which he thus attacks: The bonds of &s;ubjection are broken, and the &s;ubject or inferior, who never pretended, and who never could engage to carry his obedience to this exce&s;&s;ive length, re-enters from thenceforth into his natural rights, or the rights of a &s;tate of nature."</P>
<P>So that we &s;ee, when a man, who is in danger from a bad government, can nei|ther alter it, nor di&s;&s;olve it, the defect of means to obtain one or the other of the&s;e ends, introduces the third and la&s;t mention|ed ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, and gives him a right, where a government acts contrary to the
<PB N="29" REF="012773_0027_0F8A93809A26A808">
purpo&s;es and in&s;titution of &s;ociety, to for|&s;ake that government, and to &s;hift for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>FOR, where there is no protection, there is no obligation to &s;tay: And, where there is danger, as there mu&s;t be danger from a combination of murderers, there is great rea&s;on to depart. Self-pre&s;ervation, the primary law of nature, as well as the cement of &s;ociety, will, in this ca&s;e, oblige him to abandon his pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and &s;eek a place of refuge for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THIS matter is briefly &s;tated, and de|termined in this manner, in the religion of nature delineated, <HI>Sect.</HI> vii. propo&s;ition ix.</P>
<P>"IN re&s;pect of tho&s;e things, (&s;ays the Author) which the laws of the place take no cognizance of, or if they do take cog|nizance of them, yet if the benefit of tho&s;e laws cannot be had, he who is a member of &s;ociety, in other re&s;pects retains his natu|ral liberty&mdash;and mu&s;t endeavour to act ac|cording to truth and his be&s;t prudence&mdash;For in the fir&s;t ca&s;e, where there is no cog|nizance taken, there is nothing to limit him. And in the other, it is the &s;ame as nothing; &s;ince in effect there is no law, where no effect or benefit from it is to be had,"</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="012773_0028_0F8A93814D2E8AD0">
How much greater then, will I add, mu&s;t be his danger, and in proportion how much more precipitant his flight? If the magi&s;trate &s;hould not only neglect him in danger, but even become his pur&s;uer, and appear as a murderer, at the head of mur|derers, directing them to do their office.</P>
<P>IN this &s;ituation the per&s;on &s;topping or hindering his e&s;cape is guilty of the &s;ame wrong, as tho&s;e who per&s;ue him to his de|&s;truction; and, therefore, may be treated in ju&s;t the &s;ame manner. For he that would turn me back upon an adver&s;ary, that pur&s;ues me with an armed force to de&s;troy me, is acting the &s;ame part as that adver&s;ary: And, therefore, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, may be de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>UPON this principle is founded the le|gality of &s;udden emigrations from a di&s;|ordered &s;tate, which the government, when violence has been committed, have no right to with&s;tand, or with&s;tand at their own peril, it being an unju&s;t detention. For, in circum&s;tances pre&s;&s;ing and dangerous, long and formal declarations may hazard the lives or defeat the de&s;ign of the emi|grants. Be&s;ides, the rulers of a &s;tate have no right at that juncture to expect a re|mon&s;trance. Where the compact is di&s;|&s;olved, the government is from that time
<PB N="31" REF="012773_0029_0F8A938217C261D8">
nothing but mere tyranny: And, there|fore, in &s;uch a ca&s;e the departure it&s;elf is a legal, though tacit renunciation of all connexion; as the arrival and &s;ettlement in a &s;trange land are pre&s;umed to be a real, though tacit, &s;ubjection to another country.</P>
<P>THIS is generally the expedient where the refugees are di&s;per&s;ed, and in number not &s;ufficient to make a &s;ettlement of their own: But if they can collect them&s;elves and form them&s;elves into a colony, that colony has a right to depart. We have examples of this &s;ort in the &s;ece&s;&s;ions of the old Romans, which the &s;enate did not at|tempt to with&s;tand: But what is neare&s;t our purpo&s;es, our own ance&s;tors have left us a remarkable precedent upon a like oc|ca&s;ion. In the time of <HI>Charles</HI> I. when di&s;|putes ran high between the &s;ubject and the Prince, when the public money was &s;quan|dered, and replaced by force when their liberties were gone, and their per&s;ons vi&s;ibly in danger, when no one could &s;peak a favor|able word of the government but tho&s;e who &s;hared, or expected to &s;hare the plunder of the public, by being placemen and pen&s;ioners to the court: They preferred a wilderne&s;s to a country which was &s;o &s;oon to be the &s;cene of di&s;traction and blood&s;hed, and &s;ought an a&s;ylum in America. To their new &s;et|tlement,
<PB N="32" REF="012773_0030_0F8A9382C709C5E8">
as a mark of their de&s;cent, and the be&s;t means of pre&s;erving their memori|al and exi&s;tence as a people; they gave it their national name, and called it NEW-ENGLAND, &s;ince the name of the old was now to give way to that of Great-Britain, and be lo&s;t in oblivion for ever. The bad government at home, alarmed by this revolt and fore&s;eeing their own decay in the re|moval of the &s;ubjects, (<HI>The want of people is the de&s;truction of the Prince.

THESE are the &s;ubjects, which, con&s;ider|ing the increa&s;ing danger of the times, as well as the original melancholy occa&s;ion of the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es, the con&s;cientious di&s;|charge of my duty would not permit me to pa&s;s over in &s;ilence.

<P>FOR, notwith&s;tanding the mighty offence, which &s;ome people affected to take at the doctrine of my fir&s;t &s;ermon, tending to &s;hew the &s;upreme and indi&s;pen&s;able authority of the laws of God, and the impiety and fatal con&s;equences of &s;creening and abetting murder&mdash;the practice has been &s;till conti|nued&mdash;out of an high regard, no doubt, to the con&s;titution and the &s;upport of magi&s;trates, who, when acting again&s;t law, ought not to be &s;upported at all; and when acting according to law&mdash;mu&s;t be very &s;trangely &s;upported!
