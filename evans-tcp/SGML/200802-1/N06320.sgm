<BIBL>PSALM XXII. 28.</BIBL>
<Q>FOR the Kingdom is the Lord's: And He is Governour among the Nations.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Nece&s;&s;ity and Importance of civil Government, to the Welfare of Mankind, and the manifold Ad|vantages of it to humane Society, have been &s;o often, and &s;o well treated of upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions as this; that it is needle&s;s to add any thing to what has been &s;aid by my Reverend Fathers who have gone before me, on this Subject.</P>
<P>But after all that Man, that the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t of Men, in the mo&s;t exalted Stations can do, there Manife&s;tly needs a &s;uperiour Wi&s;|dom, Power and Goodne&s;s, to govern the World, and order the great Affairs of King|doms and Nations to the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t Purpo&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="008017_0005_102E1477B30FDA88">It will not therefore be improper or un&s;ea|&s;onable to rai&s;e our Thoughts to the Ble&s;&s;ed and only Potentate, and to con&s;ider &s;omething of his univer&s;al Empire and Dominion over all Nations, yea over all Creatures, and all Events; when the Heads and Rulers of our Tribes are a&s;&s;embled, to give Thanks to GOD for his great Goodne&s;s to this People, in the many di&s;tingui&s;hing Privileges, which thr&ocirc; his good Providence, we have been, and are yet indulged with; and to &s;eek his Guidance and Ble&s;&s;ing on our public Intere&s;ts and Con|cerns; particularly, upon the important Af|fairs that lay before our General A&s;&s;embly; e&s;pecially, at &s;uch a Sea&s;on as this, when our Nation and Land are involved in the Calami|ties of War, when Kings of the Earth are &s;et|ting them&s;elves, and Rulers and Kingdoms combining and taking coun&s;el together again&s;t us, and not again&s;t us only, but, as it is ap|prehended, again&s;t the whole Prote&s;tant Inte|re&s;t, and the Reformed Churches in general.</P>
<P>'Tis ju&s;t matter of Support and Comfort <HI>that GOD governs the World,</HI> that the Supreme Ordering and Di&s;po&s;al of all things is in the Hands of infinite Wi&s;dom, Power, and Good|ne&s;s: <HI>The LORD reigneth, let the Earth re|joyce: let the Multitude of the i&s;les be glad thereof.</HI> P&s;al. 97.1.

<P>This P&s;alm, wherein is our Text, is un|doubtedly a Prophecy of CHRIST, there are &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages of it expre&s;sly applied to Him in the New Te&s;tament, and there are &s;ome Pa&s;|&s;ages in it, that can be applied to none el&s;e in their &s;tricte&s;t and mo&s;t proper Sen&s;e, and can belong to David, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> be here con|&s;idered as a Type of Chri&s;t in a figurative and metaphorical Sen&s;e only. &mdash; The deep Aba&s;ement, and bitter and unparallel'd Sufferings of our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, &mdash; The very kind, and manner, and circum&s;tances of his Death, his glorious Exaltation, and the &s;pread|ing and propagation of his Kingdom thr&ocirc; the World, are here foretold, and &s;ome re|markable Circum&s;tances attending them, &s;o very minutely pointed out; and all was &s;o exactly fulfilled in our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> as to give very convincing Evidence that this is indeed the CHRIST, the promi&s;ed Saviour of the World.</P>
<P>What the in&s;pired Apo&s;tle &s;aith of Him <HI>Phil.</HI> 2 6,&mdash;10. is here foretold, and may &s;erve as a Comment or Illu&s;tration on great

Part of this P&s;alm: viz. <HI>That being in the form of GOD, He thought it not Robbery to be equal with GOD: But made him&s;elf of no Re|putation and took upon him the form of a Ser|vant; and was made in the likene&s;s of Men: and being found in Fa&s;hion as a Man, be hum led him&s;elf and became obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Cro&s;s Wherefore GOD al&s;o hath highly exalted him, and given him a Name which is above every Name: that in the Name of JE&s;US every Knee &s;hould bow,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>CHRIST was rai&s;ed from the deepe&s;t A|ba&s;ement and Sufferings, to the highe&s;t Dignity, Honour and Glory: This gives Hope to his People when in a low afflicted State, that Light will &s;ooner or later ari&s;e to them out of Dark|ne&s;s, &s;ince He who once &s;uffered for them, in their Stead, as well as for their Good, now lives and reigns above, to di&s;pen&s;e the Ble&s;|&s;ings He died to purcha&s;e, and always has &s;hown, and will always &s;how, a very tender Concern for his Church and People whom He has redeemed with his own Blood.
