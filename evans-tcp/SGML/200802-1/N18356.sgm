<P>MARTIN, the con&s;table. A warrant came into my hands to arre&s;t Sweeting the pri&s;oner, at the bar; on the way to his hou&s;e we met Quimby and two more men &s;having &s;hingles&mdash;we had rum with us&mdash;we drank with them&mdash;they a&s;ked, if we wanted more people; and they went with us. As we were on the way a man met us, and I &s;aid, he had been and given Sweeting warning. In the evening as I went towards his hou&s;e a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> met us and &s;aid, Who is there? We made no an&s;wer, but proceeded to his hou&s;e, and found the doors &s;hut&mdash;I demanded en|trance, and his wife opened the door, and &s;aid Sweeting was not there. I lit a candle, but not finding him, &s;aw by the &s;now he had gone out at the back door into a piece of wood near by&mdash;we follow|ed; and I &s;aw him &s;tanding upon a rock&mdash;I made up towards him, behind him, and &s;truck at him, and &s;aid you are my pri&s;oner; but it being dark and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">|ing a mitten on my hand, whether I touched him I can't &s;ay. He jumped off the rock&mdash;I called for help&mdash;he was &s;oon caught, they fell down, and I fell on them: He &s;aid I will give up. I bound him, we found Quimby was wounded&mdash;he was brought into the hou&s;e and laid down. Sweeting &s;aid if the man is hurt? I hurt him with my fall: I would not have hurt him had I known it was Quimby. Said I, then you meant to kill &s;omebody. <HI>Que&s;t.</HI> By court. Where was the de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;ed, Quimby? An&s;. When I &s;truck at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> he was along with the others.

all the people pre&s;ent. Court, was Quimby wound|ed when you made Sweeting a pri&s;oner? An&s;. I can't tell&mdash;I called for a&s;&s;i&s;tance&mdash;I did not call on Quim|by in particular. Court, did the pri&s;oner know that you was an officer? An&s;. I can't &s;ay. Court, was you then in the di&s;trict of which you was cho&s;en con|&s;table? An&s;. I don't know. Court, look at the war|rant, if it is the &s;ame you took him upon? An&s;. Yes, Court, what time in the evening was it? An&s;. About eight o'clock. Court, did the pri&s;oner know you had a warrant again&s;t him? An&s;. I don't know. Court, how happened it you had &s;uch a number? An&s;. The plaintiff who took out the warrant again&s;t the pri&s;oner, &s;aid he would get a number to go along with me. Court, did you agree the&s;e men &s;hould go with you? An&s;. In an&s;wer to the plaintiff, I &s;aid very well. Court, was it dark, how could you know Sweeting; did he &s;ay any thing when he met you be|fore you went into his hou&s;e? No. I knew him by a frock he had on. Court, when you made him a pri|&s;oner did you tell him on what account? No. How long did he &s;tand on the rock? An&s;. He went of immediately. Que&s;t. How long was it before Quim|by and the pri&s;oner were clinched! An&s;. Immedi|ately. Que&s;t. When they fell which way did their heads full? An&s;. Towards the rock Court, did the pri&s;oner retreat when you touched him on the rock? An&s;. He jumped off immediately. Que&s;t. When Quim|by and the pri&s;oner lay on the ground did the de|cea&s;ed complain? An&s;. No. What an&s;wer did the pri|&s;oner make after it was found Quimby was wound|ed? An&s;. He &s;aid if I had known it was Quimby I would as &s;oon have killed my own brother.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tice, who i&s;&s;ued the warrant. Que&s;t. Did you give out this warrant again&s;t the pri&s;oner? Yes, Are you a ju&s;tice of the peace? Yes. Has the wit|ne&s;s now delivered much the &s;ame te&s;timony as he did before you? An&s;w. I think he has; I don't per|ceive any material difference.</P>

Withey, Martin de&s;ired me to go with him at the time that has been mentioned. Que&s;t. Did he acquaint you with the bu&s;ine&s;s? An&s;. He &s;aid he was going to take Sweeting for &s;tealing. On com|ing near his hou&s;e, we met a brother of the pri&s;on|er in the road&mdash;we had a &s;cu&s;&s;le with him&mdash;then went to his hou&s;e&mdash;finding the doors &s;hut, we threat|tened to break the door&mdash;we went in but did not find him&mdash;I &s;aw him before he was on the rock. Court, what then happened? An&s;. I heard Martin &s;ay, he was his pri&s;oner. Did you &s;ee Martin touch him? An&s;. No. I &s;aw them living on the ground or &s;now. Court, had the pri&s;oner any thing in his hand? An&s;. I &s;aw not any thing. Court, what words did Martin u&s;e when he made him a pri&s;oner? Did he &s;ay, <HI>In the name of the people of the &s;tate of New|York,</HI> he was his pri&s;oner? An&s;. I can't &s;ay I heard any more, than that he was his pri&s;oner. Que&s;t. How many per&s;ons were pre&s;ent round the rock? An&s;. I think four. Que&s;t. Did you &s;ee Sweeting run? Yes. I &s;aw him running towards the road.</P>
<P>Waterman, I was with them going towards the hou&s;e, and heard &s;omebody hail, Who comes there? by the time I came up, they had ju&s;t got up out of the &s;now. Que&s;t. Did you &s;ee any man touch Sweet|ing on the rock? No. I did not. Que&s;t. How ma|ny per&s;ons were pre&s;ent? An&s;. Four. Que&s;t. did Martin order them to come on, in the name of the people? An&s;. He ordered them to come on, but not in the name of the people.</P>
<P>Pratt. Que&s;t. Did you &s;ee Martin u&s;e any endea|vors to take Sweeting? No. Que&s;t. Did Martin &s;ay he had a warrant again&s;t him? No. Que&s;t. How near was Martin to the rock on which Sweeting &s;tood? An&s;. I have been there and by the track in the &s;now, I think about &s;ix feet. Que&s;t. Was it po&s;&s;ible for Martin to reach him?

Quimby? I think not, but made towards the road, when Quimby came up and &s;eized the pri&s;oner, they both fell and Martin on the top&mdash;I thought I &s;aw the arm of the pri&s;oner move backward and forward as if &s;triking the decea&s;ed. The pri&s;oner declared he heard Martin was coming to &s;earch for &s;tolen goods&mdash;that Baily had been and given him notice that they were coming.</P>
<P>Magee. That when we met them on the road. Court, Relate the matter re&s;pecting the taking the pri&s;oner. I &s;aw him on the rock, and heard him &s;ay he would kill the fir&s;t man that &s;hould touch him. Martin went up behind him, and &s;truck at him, and &s;aid he was his pri&s;oner, and I thought I heard the blow, and that Martin touched him, but I am not certain; I &s;aw the arm of the pri&s;oner moving as ob|&s;erved before; I ran up and &s;eized the pri&s;oner by the throat and put my knee upon his head and Martin took the knife <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the hand of the pri&s;oner&mdash;then they took hold of Quimby, who &s;aid he was wounded. I &s;aid &s;ecure the murderer. Sweeting &s;aid, the Lord knows how it was done: I think he mu&s;t have fal|len on the knife. I did not know him in the dark&mdash;had I known him, I would not have hurt him&mdash;I would as &s;oon have killed my own brother.</P>
<P>THE attorney-general, and the coun&s;el for me a|greed they would not argue the cau&s;e; but that I might &s;peak for my&s;elf to the jury. I had been told by my coun&s;el, not to &s;ay any thing&mdash;they would manage the bu&s;ine&s;s. I therefore depended wholly on them, and did not challenge any of the jury, nor a&s;k the witne&s;&s;es any que&s;tions.</P>
<P>I conclude the evidence being &s;o different from what my coun&s;el I expected, and from what they had been informed it. Would be, that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fed the cau&s;e mu&s;t be again&s;t me, and that it appeared a murder of &s;uch a black and horrid nature, and evi|dently committed with the greate&s;t degree of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and premeditation, that like hone&s;t men they were
<PB N="7" REF="023814_0007_0FC13983ED726640">
unwilling to hurt their characters with &s;uch a bad cau&s;e, and therefore abandoned me in the moment of &s;urprize, and left it to my own management as to making my defence.</P>
<P>I conceive the providence of God over-rules even in the &s;malle&s;t tran&s;actions if men in this world, and that it is to be my fate to die in this way, as a pun|i&s;hment for my &s;ins and a warning to others. My coun&s;el, tho' eminent and learned, did not make the defence which I expected. I know not, to what it can be imputed, better than an over ruling hard of Providence, that they did not make &s;ome defence. We read of the coun&s;el of Ahithophel being by God turned into fooli&s;hne&s;s. It can't then be &s;trange to &s;uppo&s;e that God now over-rules the affairs of men.</P>
<P>On te&s;timony like this, it would not be &s;trange to hear coun&s;el remark&mdash;that it mu&s;t be very extraor|dinary, that a witne&s;s in a dark night, at &s;ome di&s;|tance, in a hurry, pur&s;uing a man, in a deep &s;now, with a hard cru&s;t almo&s;t &s;ufficient to bear a man, &s;hould &s;ee Martin lift his hand to &s;trike at me to make me a pri&s;oner; but it is more extraordinary, that under the&s;e circum&s;tances with the addition of the hallowing and yelling they made, a witne&s;s could think he heard the blow of Martin's hand &s;trike me? What mortal on earth unprejudiced, could better him&s;elf to believe that the &s;ound of Mar|tin's mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">en again&s;t my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ock could produce a &s;ound to be heard above this yelling and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound of tra|velling in &s;uch a &s;tiff &s;now? Is it now al&s;o very ex|traordinary that witne&s;&s;es under the&s;e circum&s;tan|ces could think they &s;aw my arm moving backward and forward, as if &s;triking the decea&s;ed: as they &s;ay it was all done immediately And, I think it was &s;aid in court. I flew upon Quimby, tho it has been; &s;aid by them he was upon me. If then they &s;aw the arm of the uppermo&s;t man move, It was not mine. If they &s;aw either move it mu&s;t be difficult <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> not impo&s;&s;ible to determine which, (under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">

&s;tances before mentioned) and con&s;idering we were both buried in the depth of the &s;now. Would it not have de&s;erved a moment's thought whether a party of men having a lawful warrant and though cloathed with the authority of law, getting drunk and com|mitting a riot, ought not to leave a doubt on the mind whether full faith and credit ought to be pla|ced upon their te&s;timony in a cau&s;e of life and death; and of the truth of &s;o many circum&s;tances related by them, happening in their heat and zeal; fomented by many extraordinary circum&s;tances, and plentiful draughts of rum, which they &s;aid they had with them? Is it the common practice of a con&s;table to col|lect &s;uch a number, to execute a tri&s;ling warrant&mdash;to come in &s;uch a riotous manner, with an intention to break doors, to take a man pri&s;oner dead or alive?</P>
<P>If this is law, yet it mu&s;t leave a &s;u&s;picion, that tho&s;e per&s;ons when called as witne&s;&s;es re&s;pecting their own tran&s;action, do not feel that coolne&s;s and calm|ne&s;s which witne&s;&s;es ever ought to feel in matters of &s;uch importance.</P>

<HEAD>My defence to the jury.</HEAD>
<P>Gentlemen of the jury, I de&s;ire your attention, and that God would in&s;pire you to do me ju&s;tice. You are &s;en&s;ible of the failure of human nature, and that mankind may be actuated by prejudice. If you bring me in guilty I conceive you will not do me ju&s;tice.&mdash;I had no intention to hurt any man&mdash;I was fright|ned, and my intention in taking weapons was only to frighten them&mdash;I knew not why they were com|ing after me&mdash;I knew not of any warrant&mdash;I feared they would do mi&s;chief. The evidences are preju|diced, and do not know the truth, or have not deli|vered the whole truth&mdash;There is ONE who knows the truth, and before whom I and they mu&s;t ap|pear.&mdash;If you take my life it will be unju&s;tly taken as I had no intention of murder, and can't con&s;ider my&s;elf guilty of murder&mdash;If I have not ju&s;tice here, I &s;hall have it hereafter, and it I die I hope to die a
<PB N="9" REF="023814_0009_0FC1398BA72B82F8">
good man.&mdash;I will relate the &s;tory; I heard a number of men were coming after me; I got my brother to &s;tay with me, at my hou&s;e, and they not coming in the evening, my brother propo&s;ed going to the next hou&s;e, on the way toward where they were; I was loath, but complied: the &s;now being deep and but little path he went fir&s;t and I after him; we heard men coming, making a great noi&s;e, he called to them, I ran back to the hou&s;e, and through the hou&s;e, and back into the woods, they found my track and pur|&s;ued me. I was &s;tanding on a rock, and finding by the noi&s;e I was almo&s;t &s;urrounded, and thinking I had one way to e&s;cape, there appearing a vacancy that way, I jumped off from the rock and made for that way, but the unfortunate Darius Quimby met me, both fell, a number had hold of me and had me down &s;ome time in the &s;now: when they let me get up, Quimby &s;aid he was wounded.</P>
<P>THIS is about the &s;ub&s;tance of what I &s;aid to the court: being agitated in mind, and not expecting, I &s;hould be called to &s;ay any thing, I forgot a num|ber of circum&s;tances, which I think would have o|perated in my favor. One of which is, con&s;ider|ing it had been given in evidence, that I &s;aid, if I had known it was Quimby, I would not have hurt him, I would as &s;oon have killed my own bro|ther, I added at the &s;ame time, I would not have killed him, <HI>nor any other man,</HI> &s;ooner than I would have killed my own brother. Which la&s;t words, "nor any other man," were wholly left out of the evidence; and I conclude, that &s;aying, I would not have killed him, led the court to believe I meant to kill &s;ome one: &amp; by the te&s;timony delivered in court, it &s;eemed &amp; was held up, &amp; I &s;uppo&s;e legally proved to the court and jury, that I intended to murder &s;ome one: but as I am now a dying man, and view my&s;elf on the borders of eternity, and know that in a few days my naked &s;oul mu&s;t appear at the tremen|dous bar of a &s;in-hating GOD, I can now appeal to
<PB N="10" REF="023814_0010_0FC1398CEE5396B0">
him for the rectitude of my intention, at that time, and declare, I had not the lea&s;t intention of killing any man; and if malice is nece&s;&s;ary, to con&s;titute the crime of murder, I never have, nor do I at this time con&s;ider my&s;elf guilty of murder, though I have mo&s;t earne&s;tly begged of GOD, that if I was guil|ty of murder, he would be plea&s;ed to convince me thereof. I know the te&s;timony was &s;uch as led the court and jury to believe I intended to kill &s;ome one; therefore killing one whom I did not intend, was con&s;idered a killing by malice. I have not related this with a view to ca&s;t the mo&s;t di&s;tant reflection on the honorable court, it being far from my intention to ca&s;t any reflection on the court, jury, or witne&s;&s;es, though I have &s;aid the whole truth has not appeared by the witne&s;&s;es; but it may be it was according to the be&s;t of their knowledge and belief: If it was not &s;o, I from my heart forgive them, and my earne&s;t prayer is that they may find forgivene&s;s with God, through the complete and perfect &s;atisfaction of the Redeemer.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="charge to jury">
<HEAD>The following is the &s;ub&s;tance of the charge delivered by the hon. Chief Ju&s;tice Yates, to the jury.</HEAD>
<P>Gentlemen of the jury, you have heard the pri&s;oner at the bar charged with the murder of Darius Quimby. It has been given in evidence to you, that the con&s;table had a lawful warrant to apprehend the pri&s;oner, in an action of tre&s;pa&s;s; that the pri|&s;oner fled from ju&s;tice into the woods, and placed him&s;elf upon a rock; and being pur&s;ued, and nearly &s;urrounded, the con&s;table came behind him, &s;truck at him, and &s;aid he was his pri&s;oner&mdash;But whether the con&s;table touched him, or not, it being dark, he is not certain, but thinks he did&mdash;The con&s;table gives you no account how the &s;troke was given; but anoth|er witne&s;s &s;ays that while the pri&s;oner and Quimby were clinched together, lying in the &s;now, he &s;aw the arm of the pri&s;oner move backward and forward as if &s;triking the decea&s;ed. Another witne&s;s &s;ays, that

the pri&s;oner while &s;tanding on the rock &s;aid he would kill the fir&s;t man that &s;hould touch him. From the&s;e witne&s;&s;es you are to determine the crime of murder, charged again&s;t the pri&s;oner.&mdash;I will in|form you what is the crime of murder, it is a killing with malice expre&s;&s;ed or implied. Implied by ly|ing in wait to kill&mdash;by intending to kill one, but in fact killing one whom he had no intention to, is murder.&mdash;With re&s;pect to the officers of ju&s;tice, it is by law declared it an officer is killed, doing his duty, it is murder, if it be known he was an officer: re|&s;i&s;ting an officer is unlawful&mdash;It is al&s;o murder if committed on tho&s;e called to a&s;&s;i&s;t an officer, in the execution of his office. A man has been killed, a&s;&s;i&s;|ting an officer in executing a lawful warrant, which warrant has been before you, and no &s;ugge&s;tion of it being illegal.&mdash;it remains with you then to con&s;ider whether there was a warrant&mdash;an officer&mdash;and an a&s;&s;i&s;tant by the orders of the officer&mdash;whether the man killed, was killed a&s;&s;i&s;ting the officer, by the or|ders of the officer&mdash;and whether the pri&s;oner at the bar is guilty of the murder laid to his charge&mdash;If you are convinced in your con&s;ciences he is guilty, &s;ay &s;o&mdash;If he is not guilty, &s;ay &s;o.</P>
<P>I was found guilty&mdash;and afterwards being called to the bar, was a&s;ked by the honorable Chief Ju&s;tice what I had to &s;ay why &s;entence of death &s;hould not be pronounced again&s;t me, and not replying,
<HI>The Chief Ju&s;tice proceeded, in &s;ub&s;tance, as follows:</HI>
You, Sweeting! It appeared on your trial, that you knew an officer had a warrant again&s;t you&mdash;you &s;led from ju&s;tice, which it is a crime to do&mdash;you gave out high threatning words, that you would kill the fir&s;t man that &s;hould touch you.&mdash;The officer was in the lawful execution of his office&mdash;the men a&s;&s;i&s;ting him were acting the part of faithful, good citizens.&mdash;If a man lifts his hand again&s;t another, with an inten|tion to kill him, and kills &s;ome bo&s;om friend, it is murder.

and death en&s;ue, it is murder.&mdash;Let this be a|duced to correct a wrong idea that is entertained by people, that they may re&s;ist officers, doing their du|ty. Officers doing their duty are under the pro|tection of the law. You &s;aid you &s;hould not have killed him whom you killed (had you known him) &s;ooner than you would have killed your own bro|ther: This indicates that you intended to kill &s;ome one among them. Your crime is not only again&s;t the laws of man, but directly again&s;t the laws of the Supreme Being. The apo&s;tle Paul &s;ays, the pow|ers that be, are ordained of God, and who&s;oever re|&s;i&s;teth the power, re&s;i&s;teth the ordinance of God, and they that re&s;i&s;t &s;hall receive to them&s;elves dam|nation.&mdash;You did not &s;ubmit to the lawful authority&mdash;you re&s;i&s;ted till death en&s;ued, and a murder com|mitted upon one of your neighbors&mdash;You &s;hed his blood, and by the divine law he that &s;heddeth man's blood by man &s;hall his blood be &s;hed. You are a murderer, and you are condemned by this court.&mdash;Under the law there was a city of refuge, to which the man-&s;layer might flee; but alas! for you, there is none, in this world; your only hope mu&s;t be through the great atonement and the blood of the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> to which I earne&s;tly exhort you to ap|ply for pardon; and may you obtain forgivene&s;s. Nothing now remains, but (however painful,) to pronounce the &s;entence of death upon you. We are, by your crime, now con&s;trained to deprive your wife of a hu&s;band, your children of a parent, and your aged parents of a &s;on. Your &s;entence is, That you be taken back to the place from whence you came, and from thence to the place of execution, and there to be hanged by the neck until you are DEAD, and that your body be delivered to the &s;urgeon for di&s;&s;ection&mdash;and the LORD have MERCY on your poor SOUL.</P>

I intend to lay before you the rea&s;ons of my being un|der &s;entence of death, and the feelings I have had, and now have of the &s;olemn approach of death. I intend likewi&s;e to drop a word to tho&s;e who deny the offices of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and have the hardne&s;s to con&s;ider the Saviour of &s;inners, an impo&s;ter, and reli|gion a mere notion. I think I can do this mo&s;t feel|ingly, for I freely cou&s;e&s;s, I entertained the &s;ame principles, and maintained them by works natu|rally following from &s;uch corrupt ideas. Which led me into &s;in, and if I had not been by grace prevented, they would have led me to death&mdash;not only the death of this body, but to the death of the &s;oul, or &s;econd death&mdash;for the wages of &s;in is death, but the gift of God is eternal life, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord. But now, I hope I may &s;ay, that the law of the Spirit of life in Chri&s;t Je&s;us hath made me free from the law of &s;in and death, and that I am a new man&mdash;that I am born not of cor|ruptible feed, but of incorruptible and by the Word of God that liveth and abideth forever.

Likewi&s;e &s;ome advice to my dear wife and children, who are near and dear by the bands of nature. And now, Oh eter|nal God, be plea&s;ed to grant that in me may be found an excellent &s;pirit of wi&s;dom, directed by thee, the true &s;ource and fountain of wi&s;dom; that the &s;word of the Spirit may awaken convince, convert, and break the rocky hearts and cau&s;e them to fall at thy feet in humble brokenne&s;s of &s;pirit, and that the ge|nuine fruit, of faith and repentance may &s;hine thro' their life and conver&s;ation; that they may break off

<P>As to my being under &s;entence of death, it is the wages of &s;in that has brought me into this condition&mdash;as I lived in &s;in, in the neglect of God, his Son, his go&s;|pel, neglecting the vi&s;itation of the Spirit, trampling on his law and authority, and adventuring as it were on the thick bo&s;&s;es of his buckler, and even bidding de&s;iance to Omnipotence, as every carele&s;s and un|concerned &s;inner does, that lives without God in this world, how little &s;oever they lay it to heart&mdash;for &s;traight is the gate and narrow the way that lead|eth to life, and few there be that find it; but broad is the way that leadeth to death, the death of the &s;oul, and many there are, with the &s;wifte&s;t velocity, running and entering in thereat, without ever turn|ing a moment's thought upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> dreadful &s;ituation that awaits them.

Oh! what an in&s;trument in the hand of the devil I have been, while the devil was ruling and reigning in my heart!

Can it be an unrea&s;onable command, that we for&s;ake and leave all, for one who hath done &s;o much for us? for one who hath left the bo&s;om of the Fa|ther, laid a&s;ide his maje&s;tic robes of glory, left the realms of bli&s;s and happine&s;s, for a &s;table, a manager, to be a man of &s;orrow, and wear a thorny crown&mdash;in a word, a God by whom all worlds were created, and on who&s;e &s;houlders hangs the government of u|niver&s;al nature, who by his almighty power, holds all the worlds in their order, and prevents their tum|bling into confu&s;ion, to conde&s;cend to &s;acrifice his precious life for the redemption of fallen-men? Oh grace, grace! free grace, from the foundation to the top-&s;tone! God &s;o loved the world, that he gave his only Son to die for it, that who&s;oever believeth on him might not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life.

My dear friends, let me tell you it is a great thing to have union and communion with a God before whom angels and arch angels vail their faces, being unable to behold his glory.

Chri&s;tian reader! try your&s;elf and a&s;k your own heart, if you would willingly re&s;ign your bo|dy to be burnt at the &s;take, rather than deny the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS. It is an ea&s;y matter, under the &s;miles of Providence, to be reconciled, but in adver|&s;ity, when in&s;tead of the &s;miles of Providence we are called to bear afflictions, if we do not &s;ubmit with patience we ought to doubt our &s;tate&mdash;we ought to remember it is through much tribulation we mu&s;t be made meet for, and be &s;itted and prepared for the kingdom of heaven. Tho&s;e who are not cha&s;tified are not &s;ons, but ba&s;tards. And though the would are all again&s;t you, and tho' they kill the body, yet you ought to rejoice, when under the &s;entence of death.

My dear reader! if you are yet un|impre&s;&s;ed with my &s;olemn hi&s;tory, let me now for a moment, reque&s;t your &s;erious attention to your own di&s;&s;olution. Death, relentle&s;s death, will &s;oon arre&s;t you, as well as me, and &s;hould it &s;eize you at an un|happy moment, while in your career of &s;in and vani|ty, it will then be too late to think of heaven, and the glories you might have attained, had you im|proved the golden &s;ea&s;on of grace, now forever lo&s;t to you; you, like the fooli&s;h virgins, &s;leep too long.

Alas! you are now too late, your &s;hocking &s;entence is not the death of the body, but the death of the &s;oul: the &s;econd death. Will you &s;wallow the &s;weet mor&s;els of &s;in and yet flatter your&s;elf you can with confidence meet God. Remember though &s;in &s;eem &s;weet in the commi&s;&s;ion, yet it will bite like a &s;er|pent, and &s;ting like an adder. Remember that if you are ever renewed you will mourn with heart break|ing for the commi&s;&s;ion of all which you fal&s;ly call little &s;ins, while in the love and practice thereof. The&s;e reflections are applicable to my wicked life, before I was the cau&s;e of the death of that poor un|fortunate young man; what a &s;cene of mourning and lementation to his parents, his brothers and &s;i&s;ters, for their &s;on, and their brother.

I confe&s;s I was much &s;tumbled with the &s;ubject of coming to Chri&s;t, till by divine in&s;piration of the Spirit of God, my mind was wonderfully en|lightened, to di&s;cover the connection, beauty and harmony of the glorious go&s;pel, which the natural man knows not, for they are &s;piritually di&s;cerned.</P>

I will then attempt to expre&s;s my ideas of the work of coming to Chri&s;t, or believing on him, on which depend the &s;alvation or damnation of every mortal under heaven. It is &s;aid by the Saviour "No man cometh unto me except the Father, who hath &s;ent me, draw him;" and it is by man, a&s;&s;igned as a rea&s;on for not coming, becau&s;e they are not drawn. But by the &s;ame authority it is &s;aid, if I be lifted up, I will draw all men unto me, and they &s;hall be all taught of God; every one therefore, that heareth and learneth of the Father cometh unto the Son. All men are then drawn, and none but tho&s;e wilful|ly blind and rebellious are left in darkne&s;s. A mea|&s;ure of the divine Spirit is given to every man, that cometh into the world. I am not that light &s;aid John; but faith he of Chri&s;t, this is the light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world:&mdash;and faith Chri&s;t, I am come a light into the world, that who&s;oever followeth me &s;hall not walk in darkne&s;s, but &s;hall have the light of life. This light, I conceive means his divine Spirit, which all have that will follow its teaching; tho&s;e who will not, it is taken from them, and they are left in hardne&s;s, darkne&s;s; and in the words of the apo&s;tle, repro|bates; not that they were reprobated by a kind and merciful God from eternity, but by their inattention to his calls. Behold, faith the loving Je&s;us, I &s;tand at the door and knock; if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in; mo&s;t clearly then, it belongs to &s;inners to open the door, and all will open the door of their hearts and receive the King of glory in, or bar the door of their hearts again&s;t him, to their final and everla&s;ting di&s;tructon. I have &s;aid much about the divine quickning Spirit, and in order to lead you further into the knowledge of this my&s;tery, which is denied by many, though po|&s;itively expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;acred oracles, let me turn your attention to the original &s;tate of man, as he came from the forming hand of his Creator.&mdash;He was
<PB N="25" REF="023814_0025_0FC139D14044B5D8">
made holy and fell by di&s;obedience. In the day thou eat thereof, thou &s;hall a&s;&s;uredly die. In the &s;ame day he did die, not a natural, but a &s;piritual death; that principle of divine life was immediately eradi|cated from the &s;oul, and man left in a &s;tate like de|vils; without God and without hope; had it not been for the merciful interpo&s;ition of the &s;econd Per|&s;on in the Trinity, who, I conceive re&s;tored to A|dam and all his po&s;terity, a principle of divine light, or a portion of his ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, which, if believed in, and hearkened to, is &s;ufficient to con|vince, convert, &s;anctify, and bring them to glory. Therefore tho&s;e that find in them&s;elves any of this divine light, or re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the works of dark|ne&s;s, may attribute it to &s;overeign grace: it is of God, it is not our&s;elves; it is not from nature's gar|den, that corrupt root; but tho&s;e who have no remains of this divine principle, which was purcha&s;ed and giv|en by the Saviour, have had it, and lo&s;t it. If this is not the ca&s;e, how can it be &s;aid, the free gift came upon all men unto ju&s;tification of life, and that Chri&s;t ta&s;ted death for every man. Is every man then &s;aved by his death? No. If then he hath per|formed all that their nece&s;&s;ities required, he is a complete Saviour. If he has not, where is the pro|priety of the angels addre&s;s to the &s;hepherd, as be|ing matter of joy to all people? It can be no mat|ter of joy to tho&s;e for whom Chri&s;t did not die, nor to tho&s;e who are not the &s;ubjects of his &s;pecial call; and if they are not included in the great things Chri&s;t has done for the world, how can it be their con|demnation, that light is come into the world, hav|ing never reached them&mdash;they not being included in that light. The tidings of &s;alvation therefore can be no matter of joy to them. And the &s;acred ora|cles &s;ay, they are damned for not believing on the name of the only begotton Son of God. If he did not die for them, and they are damned for not be|lieving on him, they are damned for not believing

a lie. I find the &s;criptures both of the old and new te&s;tament, hold up to view that all mankind may obtain &s;alvation if they will: But &s;ay &s;ome, it is God that gives the will&mdash;and as a &s;overiegn, he gives to &s;ome and not to others&mdash;I conceive he gives to all power, liberty and ability, and leaves it to their choice to obey and be happy, or to di&s;obey, and be mi&s;erable; or why are &s;uch pathetic expre&s;|&s;ions to obedience, u&s;ed, as, Take heed and ob&s;erve, for, it is for your life: Oh that they were wi&s;e to con|&s;ider their latter end! and, How often would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wing, and ye would not: And ye will not come unto me, that ye might have life: Do not the&s;e texts imply that all bars in the way of &s;in|ners coming to Chri&s;t are removed. What means this coming to Chri&s;t? I humbly conceive it is at|tending to the vi&s;itations of his divine Spirit, which knock at every heart, and in receiving the heaven|ly Me&s;&s;enger, and being lead, guided and governed by the dictates thereof&mdash;and in conforming our lives to the perfect pattern of the &s;acred oracles. It ap|pears to me to be a vain hope, to expect heaven and live in &s;in. "My &s;heep know my voice and follow me." What is it to follow Chri&s;t, but to follow him in the way of holine&s;s, and to pattern after his per|fect example. "Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things that I &s;ay?' Should it now he &s;aid, I expect to obtain &s;alvation by my works; I &s;ay I do, but not <HI>for</HI> my works nor on the ground of merit. I do not think &s;o little of the joys of &s;pending an e|ternal duration in beholding the face of a reconciled God, as to conceive &s;uch an ine&s;tiamble ble&s;&s;ing can be purcha&s;ed by a few good works; but they are pro|mi&s;ed to tho&s;e that yield obedience to God, and do his will, and to none but &s;uch. A que&s;tion here will ari&s;e. "What is the will of God?" I conceive it is that principle of goodne&s;s flowing from the divine perfection and ever promoting holine&s;s agreeable to

his mo&s;t holy nature; for if God is holy, nothing but holine&s;s can flow from him. As is the fountain, &s;o is the &s;tream: it being the height of ab&s;ardity to &s;uppo&s;e a holy God the author of &s;ins, or of our vi|cious propen&s;ities to evil; and where it is &s;aid, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">'s there evil in the city, and the Lord hath not done it? it means natural evil, and not moral, The exhorta|tion is, Be ye holy for I am holy. Should we adopt the other principle, the injunction mu&s;t be inverted thus, Be you unholy for I the Lord your God am un|holy. But &s;ay &s;ome, if every thing does not take place according to the will of God, then he is infi|nitely cro&s;&s;ed by &s;in, and the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of all beings. But if it is acknowledged, that moral evil is in its nature infinitely contrary to the law of per|fections and government of God. we may &s;ay by the &s;ame mode of rea&s;oning. he is fru&s;trated pained and grieved by &s;in; viewing it in its nature, as that he chu&s;eth it: and is plea&s;ed with it, viewed in its con&s;equences.

So the carnal, un|concerned &s;inners hide their talent (meaning, as I conceive, their mea&s;ure of the holy Spirit) in the earth; they bury it in things of this world to their everla&s;ting de&s;truction. As every thing is attract|ing towards the fountain, God is the fountain from whom flows this Spirit&mdash;he is the fountain of light and life, and &s;o his Spirit is from the fountain and leads or draws to God, or to chri&s;t, he being co|equal, co|eternal one in the godhead, and in&s;epara|ble.

<P>GRATITUDE and duty, lead me to leave a few lines with you, which. I humbly hope, may be to your comfort and con&s;olation, when I am &s;eparated from you by the &s;troke of death. I now in my dying lan|guage, to my &s;'orrow, confe&s;s my di&s;obedience to you and my inattention to the in&s;truction, &s;orrow and tears of my tender parents, to induce me to remem|ber my Creator in the days of my youth and your coun&s;el and advice to me, endeavoring to prevent my running into pre&s;umptuous &s;ins; I thank you for your kindne&s;s in giving me learning&punc; which you expected, when I &s;hould take the reins of &s;elf-government into my own hands, might be of &s;ervice to me, and the community, and be a help to enable me to conduct in &s;uch manner as to be a comfort to you in your declining age. But alas! mi&s;taken parents, your la|bor is lo&s;t, your expectation di&s;appointed, your&s;elves to whom I ought to have been a comfort and &s;upport, I am now bringing with &s;toods, of tears, and the keene&s;t angui&s;h of heart to the grave.</P>
<P>I, with humble penitence, beg your forgivene&s;s, for my di&s;obedience, and for what I, by my folly, have brought on you. I am ju&s;t upon the brink of what the world con&s;iders, an ignominous death: but I can a&s;&s;ure you, I have abundant rea&s;on to adore the good|ne&s;s of God to me in bringing me to death in the way be&s;t &s;uited to his own glory, and my own ever|la&s;ting good.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="023814_0037_0FC13A0EB02633D0">
And now, my dear parents! let me as a dying child give you a word of advice. which may turn to your comfort. If you are already in Chri&s;t, let this provi|dence be improved by you, to bring you, and keep you &s;till nearer him; and be a means of weaning your affections from this vain and un&s;atisfying world, and placing them on things above, and of kindling the fire of love to Je&s;us, whom may you receive into your hearts, by a true and living faith. But &s;hould it be the ca&s;e, that you, or either of you, have been till this time &s;tanding idle, who knows but this pro|vidence is &s;ent of God to call you, at the eleventh hour, into his vineyard? And &s;hould you neglect, perhaps this may be the la&s;t call to you; if you now di&s;obey, may it not be &s;aid to you, The&s;e many years I came &s;eeking fruit, and found none; cut them down, why cumber they the ground? Lord, grant that this may not be in vain, and that they may bring forth fruit unto everla&s;ting life. And now my heart and hand mu&s;t bid adieu to earthly parents, and clo&s;e an eternal union with my heavenly Father, who, by his divine Spirit, has quickened and prepared me therefor, and witne&s;&s;eth with my &s;pirit that I am a &s;on of God, and heir Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Therefore, my dear parents! wipe all tears from your eyes, weep not for me, but for your&s;elves, if you have not been born of the Spirit. I can wel|come death with all its horrors, and lift my &s;oul on the wings of faith, and &s;ay. Oh death, where is thy &s;ting Oh grave, where is thy victory?

<P>As the&s;e are my la&s;t words to you, let them be impre&s;&s;ed on your hearts.

I tell you may, but except ye repent, ye &s;hall likewi&s;e peri&s;h." If you, or any of you, are de&s;titute of the Spirit, ru|ling and reigning in your hearts, and are not led by the Spirit of Chri&s;t, you belong not to him, for only tho&s;e that art led by the Spirit of God belong to God: and if any man have not the Spirit of Chri&s;t he is none of his. If you, or any of you, find your&s;elves out of Chri&s;t, or that Chri&s;t, the only &s;ure hope of glory, is not in you. Oh give not &s;leep to your eyes nor &s;lumber to your eye-lids, while remaining in your lamentable &s;ituation! Come to Je&s;us, enter while there is room, before the door be &s;hut, and you in vain &s;ay "Lord, Lord, open unto us," Alas, alas! too late, the ruin of thou&s;ands, waiting till their day of grace is pa&s;t, till the everla&s;ting door is &s;hut, for ever &s;hut again&s;t them. Oh place no depen|dance on work, for ju&s;tification, yet expect not &s;al|vation without practi&s;ing every Chri&s;tian virtue: vain will be your hope of heaven if ye live in &s;in: do not take conviction for conver&s;ion, depend not on your conver&s;ion, for unle&s;s you are &s;anctified and clean&s;ed from &s;in you belong not to God, as he that committeth &s;in is of the devil; and who&s;oever is born of God &s;inneth not.

Que&s;t. <HI>What is the internal cau&s;e of conviction?</HI> An&s;.

my naked &s;oul will &s;oon be called to appear and re|ceive &s;entence, that it is the truth relating to &s;aid murder&mdash;In the fir&s;t of the evening as I was &s;itting by my fire, with my little lovely family in peace, Stephen Bailey knocked at my door, and &s;poke to this effect to me; You had be&s;t take care of your|&s;elf, for there is a party of men, I overheard &s;ay were coming after you; I got by them; I heard Mr. Eaton rangling with them; they were in high blood: I advi&s;e you to go to your father's. When he &s;aw the men they were about a mile &s;outh of my hou&s;e. I never heard who they were not the name of Martin, or any officer; nor any warrant mention|ed, nor did I know any again&s;t me&mdash;I being frighten|ed at hearing a number of men were coming after me in &s;uch an uncommon manner, lo&s;t no time, but went immediately to my father's, fearing they would come before I could get away. When at my father's, knowing my wife to be a timorous woman, fearing &s;he might be frightened or ill u&s;ed, I a&s;ked my bro|ther to go with me and &s;pend the evening at my hou&s;e. As we went, each took a club, not knowing what to expect from a drunken mob, as I conceived them. We found none at my hou&s;e, and my wife &s;aid they had not been there. After &s;upper my brother pro|po&s;ed going to Withy's, where was another brother, and intimated, that &s;aid company not coming by that time, Bailey was mi&s;taken; only hearing the name of <HI>Sweeting</HI> mentioned, it was my brother they were after and not me. I was loath to go, but knowing my brother had that day been taken by execution, which had been paid, and been obliged to pay it a|gain, and fearing &s;uch kind of difficulty. I thought gratitude obliged me to go. My brother went fir&s;t, and I followed. We had not gone far before he hailed &s;ome people who were coming towards us&mdash;they ru&s;hed on and took him and had him down; yelled and hallowed beyond de&s;cription.&mdash;I ran to the hou&s;e and went in at the fore door&mdash;but was &s;o
<PB N="51" REF="023814_0051_0FC13A45738C6D28">
frightened at that time, I can't relate only what I have been informed &s;ince by my wife&mdash;&s;he &s;ays I ran about the hou&s;e as if I had been di&s;tracted, and went to fa&s;ten the back door, but could not, and &s;aying what &s;hall I do, &s;he an&s;wered you had be&s;t run into the woods; I made for the woods, from the back door; having got but a few rods before they &s;ur|rounded the hou&s;e, with the &s;ame hedious yelling, more like drunker &s;avages than like Chri&s;tians, and demanded entrance: I had got over a fence and &s;tood &s;till the &s;now being deep, and a cru&s;t that would not bear, moving forward would make a noi&s;e which I feared would di&s;cover me. I expected they would all go into the hou&s;e, &amp;c. then I would, if po&s;&s;ible, get away undi&s;covered: but a few only went in, and took a candle, by which they found my track in the &s;now, and &s;aid there he is gone. I then ran as fa&s;t as I could from them and towards a road; having a club and knife in my hands. I fell over a rock, and found by their noi&s;e they were near me; and conclud|ing I could not get away; I got on a rock and told them to &s;tand off; I had a great knife and a club, and would kill the fir&s;t man that &s;hould touch me; but I had no intention of killing any one, and &s;aid it only to firghten them, and if po&s;&s;ible deter them from coming nearer; but finding they paid no re|gard to what I &s;aid, and coming toward me with the &s;ame hideous yelling, I ob&s;erved one way that I might po&s;&s;ibly e&s;cape; I &s;prang from the rock, to get through between two of them that &s;eemed at a con&s;iderable di&s;tsance; Quimby being one of the two, young man, &s;prang and caught me round the body&mdash;we both fell and he on me, I &s;truggled to get away; the re&s;t flew on me in&s;tant;y, how many I know not, &s;ome had me by the throat and head which they jam|ed under the &s;now. I conclude I held fa&s;t the knife in my fright; but I now &s;ay that from fir&s;t to la&s;t, I had no intention to kill any man, my intention was
<PB N="52" REF="023814_0052_0FC13A4C65B07FA0">
to make my e&s;cape. I heard nothing of the words you are my pri&s;oner till after they flew on me and, Quimby. There was &s;uch a noi&s;e by yelling and confu&s;ion and I believe they were warm with &s;piri|tous liquor, that there was none of the company who have been able to give any direct account of the matter; as they had been drinking that day and had rum then with them after the accident happened. I never did di&s;pute the man's being killed with the knife in my hand, but how I know not; perhaps he might receive the fir&s;t wound by &s;pringing again&s;t me, and the &s;econd in falling on me or when the company were pulling and halling me in the &s;now. I heard no complaint of any wound till after Quimby was up&mdash;whether he was taken off from me, or got off him&s;elf I know not. It has been &s;aid the warrant again&s;t me was a lawful warrant, I don't &s;ay to the contrary; but I never had any dealing with the plaintiff who prayed out &s;aid warrant. It has been &s;aid the warrant was on account of a &s;u&s;picion that; had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed my&s;elf of an iron kettle, the property of the plaintiff.

<P>THE day but one before I was to be executed, my wife and children and other friends took their la&s;t farewel of me, in this world&mdash;the tears and heart-breaking &s;orrows of parting, I cannot de&s;cribe. It having been propo&s;ed that my wife and friends &s;hould apply to the doctor to whom my body had been gi|ven for di&s;&s;ection, and beg it might be delivered to them for burial; which they did and being refu&s;ed, it &s;o exceedingly affected them, that I could not help taking a part in their extreme &s;orrow on that ac|count; and having been advi&s;ed to try to make my e&s;cape, I attempted, and effected it; and with my irons on got &s;ome di&s;tance; but was &s;oon taken and brought back.&mdash;I now &s;ay, I am &s;orry that I gave way &s;o much to nature, as to try for an e&s;cape; it is what I ought not to have done; I ought not to have re&s;i&s;ted the Divine will, in dying&punc; nor giving my body to be u&s;ed for the benefit of mankind&mdash;I ought to have been a diamond in the crown of my Savi|our, who hath done and &s;uffered &s;o much for me&mdash;I am humbled in the du&s;t, and hope it will be a means of bringing me nearer my Saviour.</P>
<P>I HAVE been attended by a number of the Mini&s;|ters of the everla&s;ting Go&s;pel, and I thank them for their kind repeated vi&s;its, prayers and in&s;tructions&mdash;they endeavored to impre&s;s me with the additi|onal &s;in of not owning malice, and urged my con|fe&s;&s;ion, my an&s;wer has been, that to plea&s;e man I ought not to confe&s;s a lie to God, and thought it was ju&s;t in God to take my life in this way, or any o|ther at his plea&s;ure yet he knew I had no malice nor intention to kill any man. I expect there were &s;ome

of the clergy to whom my an&s;wers were by no means &s;ati&s;facory as to the murder, and al&s;o &s;ome princi|ples I believe, that they deny; one of which is that Chri&s;t only died for a certain number, elected from eternity, which will be &s;aved, and that others are reprobated to damnation: I can entertain no &s;uch ideas of Divine goodne&s;s, as to believe that he has doomed any part of mankind to eternal mi&s;ery, with|out affording them every thing nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;cape therefrom: but that his divine character and per|fections are the &s;ame as he hath revealed them in the &s;acred &s;cripture; and that they are not given by di|vine in&s;piration to deceive us, which I humbly conceive would be the ca&s;e if this doctrine was true&mdash;for God &s;ent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be &s;aved. If then he did not die for the world, the world through him could not be &s;aved&mdash;the purpo&s;es of God then are not an&s;wered, but totally defeated: and when I mentioned that God &s;o loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that who&s;oever believeth in him &s;hould not peri&s;h but have everla&s;t|ing life. One of tho&s;e Rev. gentlemen an&s;wered, that the world meant the elect&mdash;To which I replied, if the term world means elect, in this place, then the text will read thus: God &s;o loved the elect, that he gave his only Son that who&s;oever of the elect be|lieveth on him, may not peri&s;h. If this be the &s;en&s;e then it implies, that part of the elect may not believe&mdash;I read Chri&s;t ta&s;ted death for every man; that the free gift came upon all men unto ju&s;tification of life: and it &s;eems as if every man and all men, mu&s;t in fact, mean all men under heaven. I read of tho&s;e denying the Lord that bought them; if they were not bought by him, how could they deny him, that bought them: This, to me is unan&s;werable and unaccountable. An ob&s;ervation was made that Chri&s;t did not pray for the world, but them that the Father had given him: this to me is far from prov|ing
<PB N="56" REF="023814_0056_0FC13A5CA12F0E60">
Chri&s;t did not die for the world, becau&s;e he did not pray for the world: for Chri&s;t I conceive could pray for nothing but what would be granted if then Chri&s;t were to pray for all the world, they mu&s;t all be &s;aved: for &s;aid he I can pray to my Father and he will give me more than twelve legions of angels. From this I conclude the prayers of the Son are all granted. I a&s;ked if Adam lo&s;t every thing good, they agreed he did. I then a&s;ked what it was in us that gave us a check when we did wrong and re|mor&s;e for having &s;o done? They an&s;wered, natu|ral con&s;cience. I confe&s;s I know not what that is as they hold it. I can find no &s;uch principle in nature, and believe there is none in man, while his day of grace la&s;ts. For in Adam we lo&s;t every good, where then can &s;uch a principle &s;pring from: I can't con|ceive of but two principles <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> from God; or, from the devil. If this principle is from God, it is not natural, but &s;piritual. I hold that in Adam we lo&s;t the la&s;t &s;park of life, light and inclination to holine&s;s virtue or any thing good, more than the devil, have. What they conceive natural con&s;cience, I conceive a &s;upernatural principle, purcha&s;ed by the Redeemer; repre&s;ented in &s;cripture, by the light that lightneth every man that cometh into the world, in many places called the Spirit, a mea&s;ure of which is given every man to profit withal, and that all both elect and reprobate have it: The elect improve it, and it is increa&s;ed; to him that hath &s;hall be given. The reprobate do not improve, but re&s;i&s;t till it is taken away. They who are called re|probate are not made &s;o by an eternal decree of the greate&s;t and bell of Beings but having re&s;i&s;ted till the r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">day of grace is pa&s;t, become &s;uch by their own &s;tubbornne&s;s and wilfulne&s;s. This principle, I con|ceive clearly expre&s;&s;ed in tho&s;e words of the apo&s;tle, Examine your&s;elves, know your own&s;elves that Chri&s;t is in you except you are reprobates.&mdash;If eve|ry man that cometh into the world has that princi|ple
<PB N="57" REF="023814_0057_0FC13A6393366948">
ple, then tho&s;e reprobates have had it, and have lo&s;t it; they by their egregious and ever to be lament|ed folly have lo&s;t it pa&s;t recovery.</P>
<P>Another que&s;tion has been put to me re&s;pecting the &s;tate of infants: to which I &s;ay that, I am far from be|lieving that there are of tho&s;e in hell not more than a &s;pan long as &s;ome have had the boldne&s;s and hard|ne&s;s to a&s;&s;ert. I believe the purcha&s;e of the Redeem|er extends to all and every infant born; and that talents, or a mea&s;ure of the divine Spirit, are giv|en them, according to their day; and that tho&s;e of them, that are taken out of the world before actual tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, the divine &s;pirit &s;anctifies and clean&s;es from original &s;in. I conceive the declaration of our Lord confirms the truth of this: faith he, of &s;uch is the kingdom of heaven; and except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven. It has been ob|&s;erved to me, that, in Adam we lo&s;t all our moral abilities, but not our natural. I find no propriety for this di&s;tinction, as they make it; for all natural abilities lead towards the prince of darkne&s;s; and it is &s;piritual abilities that lead, towards the Prince of light. If we have any thing re&s;tored by Chri&s;t, it mu&s;t be &s;ufficient to place us in a &s;tate of probati|on, and &s;omething above nature; and fully adequate to the purpo&s;es for which it was purcha&s;ed and free|ly given.</P>
<P>There has al&s;o been held up to me, a di&s;tinction between common and &s;pecial grace a di&s;tinction which I conceive con&s;i&s;ts in imagination only hav|ing no foundation in the &s;acred &s;cripture. Say they, God gives his common grace to all; but his &s;pecial grace to none but the elect, I believe his &s;pecial hav|ing grace, like a grain of mu&s;tard &s;eed is given all, without exception. I do not believe &s;pec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> I &s;aving grace, as they call it &s;aving without our mo&s;t faith|ful, earne&s;t endeavors to make i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;aving, and that
<PB N="58" REF="023814_0058_0FC13A6742F56688">
if we are not faithful unto death, we never &s;hall re|ceive the crown of life.</P>
<P>Some que&s;tions were al&s;o made about foreknow|ledge. It &s;eemed as if tho&s;e divines had an idea, that, if it was from eternity known by God that A|dam would &s;in; then it followed, that Adam could not help it. To which I an&s;wered, if Adam could not help it, then he could not be blameable&mdash;he could incur no guilt. What man endowed with rea|&s;on ever thought a man to blame for what he could by no means prevent? I believe every thing is known by God from all eternity, that ever hath or ever can or will exi&s;t, and that it will come to pa&s;s exactly in the manner foreknown; but not merely becau&s;e foreknown, any more than becau&s;e afterknown: knowledge does not can&s;i&s;t in power, or agency. In all in&s;tances tho&s;e things foreknown as nece&s;&s;ary, are foreknown as nece&s;&s;ary, and tho&s;e contingent, as contingent.&mdash;I believe that Almigh|ty God is not an efficient in evil, and that nothing e|vil ever was, will, or can be brought into exi&s;tence by him. I believe every thing foreknown, and &s;ome thing, foredetermined to be brought about by his a|gency. I believe where it is &s;aid, I will harden Pha|roh's heart, means no more than that he having &s;in|ned out his day of grace while under the operation of the Spirit, it was withdrawn from him, and that mu&s;t be hardne&s;s &s;ufficient: His temper and di&s;po&s;ition was then the &s;ame as Adam's would have been after &s;inning without the interpo&s;ition of the Saviour. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of Judas in betraying his Lord; the devil entered into him, and &s;o he does every one when their day of grace is pa&s;t, and the Spirit is withdrawn; they are then under the power of the devil and fill up the mea&s;ure of their days in his &s;ervice.</P>
<P>It was ob&s;erved by &s;ome of the divines that the day of grace la&s;ted through a man's life. In &s;ome in&s;tances it may be &s;o, in others not. I can't believe
<PB N="59" REF="023814_0059_0FC13A68B5643680">
it true in the in&s;tances ju&s;t mentioned of Pharaoh and Judas: therefore &s;ailing in any in&s;tance, it can be no rule to be depended upon.</P>
<P>Another of the clergy ob&s;erved, that if Chri&s;t di|ed for all then all mu&s;t be &s;aved or his power is not &s;ufficient to &s;ave all, which degrades the Redeemer. I an&s;wer, fir&s;t: that Chri&s;t, I conceive, did not die to exert his Almighty power to &s;ave one &s;oul, but to &s;atisfy the vindictive ju&s;tice of God for all, and place all on a footing to accept his terms, and re|ceive his purcha&s;ed ble&s;&s;ing; otherwi&s;e I &s;ee no pro|priety in his commands and exhortations to cho&s;e, turn, believe and live. All mankind are in &s;cripture con&s;idered and treated as <HI>free agents,</HI> as rational be|ings; and are all called, invited and drawn by the Spirit. The Spirit and the Bride &s;ay come&mdash;Behold I &s;tand at the door and knock; that is at the heart. It belongs to us to open the door, and receive the King of Glory in; if we will not open, he will not force; if we bar, he will never brake. He hath done all things nece&s;&s;ary; what more could I have done, that I have not done: &s;aid he, not that he hath exerted his Almighty power, but hath done all that belonged to the work of redemption, and con&s;i&s;tent with the undertaking. Secondly, I &s;ay, tho' Chri&s;t died to &s;atisfy divine ju&s;tice for all, yet it is no di&s;|paragement to him not to &s;ave all, becau&s;e he never undertook it, only conditionally, and that condition on their part never has been performed. The con|trary principles, I conceive, holding that Chri&s;t did not die for the whole world, is di&s;honoring God, de|grading the Saviour, di&s;couraging &s;ouls, and the greate&s;t detriment to the progre&s;s of true religion.&mdash;It appears to di&s;honor God, by di&s;believing his &s;acred declaration &s;o often made in the &s;cripture, <HI>that he i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;pecter of per&s;ons.</HI> It degrades the pur|cha&s;e of Chri&s;t by denying the fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary &s;tep to|wards &s;alvation, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> A light, to lighten every man; and that by means of his purcha&s;e, this
<PB N="60" REF="023814_0060_0FC13A726AB549E0">
light is actually given, and that it is &s;ufficient. If we believe the &s;acred oracles, we mu&s;t believe it &s;uf|ficient for the great purpo&s;e or &s;alvation, and that all mankind have it. If it is not &s;ufficient it may be con&s;idered wor&s;e than nothing, and a means of ag|gravating the condemnation of a con&s;iderable part of mankind; and the Saviour of &s;inners has done them no favor, but the greate&s;t injury and rendered their &s;ituation infinitely wor&s;e than before. The doctrine of per&s;onal election from eternity has a tendency to exalt &s;elf, &amp; appears far from that humble &s;pirit of love and good will to all men recommended in the go&s;pel. It is di&s;couraging to &s;ouls under conviction; for they from &s;uch principles conclude &s;eeking and &s;triving are to no purpo&s;e: for if they are not elected it is not in the power of all worlds to &s;ave them&mdash;and damned to all eternity then they mu&s;t be. Many in &s;uch a &s;ituation go into de&s;truction, and I have heard of many under &s;uch di&s;couragement putting an end to their days by taking their own lives, and where is the incon&s;i&s;tency of &s;uch conduct upon the belief of &s;uch principles; for they are taught the longer they live in an unconverted &s;tate they are adding &s;in to &s;in&mdash;and they, con&s;idering they are not elected and cannot be &s;aved, believe the &s;ooner they die the le&s;s &s;in they will have to an&s;wer for.</P>
<P>I con&s;ider it detrimental to religion, to hold forth the terms of &s;alvation in a my&s;terious metaphy&s;ical light, and the Divine Character in a different view from what it is held forth in the word written by in|&s;piration of the Spirit. Tho&s;e principles fix on the &s;criptures &s;o many contradictions, as to create a &s;u&s;|picion of their being from God or any thing more than human invention; and lay a foundation for DEIS<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. While on the other hand, the principles for which I contend are mo&s;t fully &s;et forth in &s;crip|ture and in the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive and moving manner&mdash;they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> all, command all, exhort and promi&s;e all; Glorify God, exalt the Savoiur and

free grace; appear perfectly rea&s;onable, and plain to the weake&s;t capacity, &s;o that the that runs may read and under&s;tand the literal &s;en&s;e; but the &s;pi|ritual &s;en&s;e can be un&s;olded by nothing le&s;s than the divine Spirit of in&s;piration, by which they were wrote; operating in the heart and witne&s;&s;ing with the written word. Some &s;criptures are &s;poken to particular per&s;ons&mdash;&s;ome to churches, and &s;ome to kingdoms and nations. Such I conceive is Paul's to the Jews, in the ix chapter of Romans, mourning the fate of the Jews; and not the election and repro|bation of particular per&s;ons, which I humbly con|ceive does not apply to prove any thing concerning election as commonly contended for&mdash;Jacob have I loved and E&s;au have I hated, is a quotation made by the apo&s;tle, from Gen. xxv, 23, and Mal. i, 2, 3. His laying wa&s;te the heritage of Edom for the drag|ons of the wilderne&s;s, is a different thing from his appointing the per&s;on of E&s;au to eternal mi&s;ery, by a mere act of &s;overeignty, without any thing done by him to de&s;erve it.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle is &s;peaking of the two nations, and &s;hewing the Jews how without any good works done by them, and long before they were born, they were cho&s;en a peculiar people, not elected to everla&s;ting happine&s;s, but a people whom it plea&s;ed the Supreme Being to rai&s;e above any other people and to work miracles innumerable: all to bring a|bout the great and glorious event, to wit, the birth of the Saviour of the world, long before promi&s;ed; which when the apo&s;tle wrote had been brought in|to exi&s;tence; and they having abu&s;ed tho&s;e great and glorious privileges, God in his providence was about to be&s;tow them on the Gentiles&mdash;And that God as a &s;overeign di&s;po&s;eth the fate of kingdoms and nations, the times and &s;ea&s;ons according to his plea&s;ure.&mdash;In con&s;idering this chapter in any oth|er manner, it contradicts and de&s;troys the apo&s;tolic and other writings, and even the whole tenor of &s;cripture, of the old and new te&s;tament. What I un|der&s;tand by the elect is &s;uch as are converted unto
<PB N="62" REF="023814_0062_0FC13A77B938DD60">
God, and have their &s;ins pardoned and live in the exerci&s;e of that faith that works <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> love and puri|fies the heart. They are &s;uch as are cho&s;en through &s;anctification of the Spirit, and mu&s;t be &s;anctified be|fore they are elected; and though it is &s;aid God from the foundation of the world hath elected us in him; &s;o it is &s;aid of Chri&s;t, the Lamb &s;lain from the foundation of the world; but brought to pa&s;s not two thou&s;and years &s;ince: &s;o election, form the foun|dation of the world, I conceive, means holy per&s;ons that are in time converted unto God and continue in his love; and that God appoints obedient believ|ers unto &s;alvation not without, but according to his fore-knowledge of all their works from the founda|tion of the world. And God, who is unchangeable, hath fore-ordained all di&s;obedient unbelievers unto condemnation; not without but according to his fore|knowledge of all their works from the foundation of the world.&mdash;Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">'s believing is the cau&s;e of his ju&s;tification from all his &s;ins: and God is the Ju&s;tifier of all that believe in Je&s;us: Therefore a man is ju&s;|tified by faith without the deeds of the law.</P>
<P>Another que&s;tion was a&s;ked re&s;pecting the per&s;e|verance of the &s;aints. To which I an&s;wered, that I hoped none would ever f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ll away&mdash;I conceived a man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> had fallen into the fire, and narrowly e&s;caped with his life, and by means of his e&s;cape had placed him&s;elf in expectation of the greate&s;t hap|pine&s;s would be cautious of running into the mi&s;|erable&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> again.

not: Said Chri&s;t my &s;heep know my voice, and I know them and they follow me, and I give unto them eternal life, and they &s;hall never peri&s;h, neither &s;hall any pluck them out of my hand. My &s;heep hear my voice: much depends on this part of the &s;entence. Hearing in &s;cripture conveys a mo&s;t im|portant idea, on which our eternal all depends. In this place then they that are meant by hearing his voice, are they that hear, receive, obey, and walk in all the commandments of their Lord: thence none can pluck them out of his hand&mdash;But if that &s;ervant &s;hall &s;ay in his heart my Lord delayeth his coming, and be drunken: The Lord of that &s;ervant will cut him a&s;under, and appoint him his portion where is weeping, wailing and kna&s;hing of teeth,&mdash;Saith Paul, Romans, viii, 38. I am per&s;uaded, that neither death, life, angels principalities nor powers, &s;hall be able to &s;eparate us from the love of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord. This they conceive a de|mon&s;trable proof of per&s;everance, and it does effec|tually prove it to tho&s;e characters to whom he wrote; and they were &s;uch as were mentioned in the ver&s;e ju&s;t before, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> That neither tribulation, di&s;tre&s;s, per&s;ecution, peril or &s;word could deter or di&s;|&s;uade from following the voice of the lovely Je&s;us: and tho&s;e that were &s;uch, nothing could &s;eparate from his love. And as it is at this day, to the&s;e who continue in his love, they are his di&s;ciples in|deed; and none but &s;uch.</P>
<P>Another te&s;t, to prove their a&s;&s;ertion is, that whom he loveth, he loveth unto the end. What end&mdash;the end of their continuing in his love, or the way of holine&s;s? Some are mentioned as being kept by the mighty power of God through faith un|to &s;alvation. If any are kept in or through faith it is by the mighty power of God. But that all that have faith, keep it unto &s;alvation, can't be proved from &s;cripture. Adam had it and might have kept it; &s;o it is with others at this day; this mighty power of God is &s;ufficient, if we keep our&s;elves in it: if we for&s;ake him, he will for&s;ake us.

keep your&s;elves in the love of God. This is our part; God gives it to us; it belongs to us to keep it. "If any man draw back, my &s;oul &s;hall have no plea&s;ure in him:" but we are not of that number, that draw back unto perdition. This does not prove, that I my&s;elf, and you my dear reader! are not of the number that draw back: nor will our having once believed prove it; nothing le&s;s then fol|lowing Chri&s;t in the ways of holine&s;s, and feeling the internal evidence of grace within our&s;elves, witne&s;|&s;ing with our &s;pirits to the &s;acred &s;criptures, and cor|re&s;ponding there with can give as any &s;olid ground of comfort: pa&s;t experiences are not &s;afe to tru&s;t upon. The great and important que&s;tions are, What do we experience this pre&s;ent moment? not, what have we experienced&mdash;Are our lamps &s;till burning, and is the light within us increa&s;ing?

<HEAD>A &s;hort account of the life, conver&s;ation, parting advice, and execution of Whiting Sweeting&mdash;by Wm. Carter.</HEAD>
<P>I Beg leave to inform the public, that I have been intimately acquainted with Whiting Sweeting, the writer of the foregoing and that I have been pre&s;ent when he was vi&s;ited by a number of the mi|ni&s;ters of the go&s;pel, to examine into the &s;tate of his

&s;oul, and advi&s;e and pray with and for him, and have often heard him give an account of his former wicked life, before he was made a pri&s;oner, and of his conviction and conver&s;ion, while he was confined in the gaol&mdash;A &s;hort account of which I expect will be plea&s;ing to his friends and relations, and perhaps entertaining to &s;ome readers.</P>
<P>WHEN he was fir&s;t made pri&s;oner, he appeared an exceedingly ignorant man, in the knowledge of &s;cripture, and one that had never applied him&s;elf to the &s;tudy thereof; and for &s;ome time his counte|nance looked rough and di&s;agreeable. He &s;oon be|took him&s;elf to diligent reading and &s;tudying the &s;criptures, meditation and prayer; and &s;eemed an earne&s;t &s;eeker of the great things of his everla&s;t|ing peace. At a certain time, one Sunday, about the la&s;t of January now pa&s;t, after prayer and meditati|on, (as he expre&s;&s;ed it) he felt an extraordinary change, in the powers and faculties of his mind, dif|ferent from any feelings he ever had before; he felt calm and peaceable in his mind; had new views of God, of Chri&s;t, of the &s;acred &s;criptures; the truth of &s;cripture confirmed, and opened new views of God as the greate&s;t and infinitely the be&s;t of Beings&mdash;as a Being infinitely lovely and worthy of the high|e&s;t love and adoration of all creatures; as a Being at an infinite di&s;tance from all &s;in, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of perfect holine&s;s and his law &s;uch, that he could not forgive the lea&s;t &s;in without perfect &s;atisfaction; that all mankind were guilty, and unable to make &s;ati&s;|faction to his ju&s;tice for one, even the lea&s;t &s;in; that the Son of God had undertaken to make &s;atisfaction, and had brought in an everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s, for all that would give up them&s;elves to him, to be &s;a|ved &s;olely on account of his merit; and that the terms were to give up all for the Pearl of great Price: He felt him&s;elf drawn to God, and the ways of holine&s;s, and re&s;igned to God his deare&s;t enjoy|ments, and &s;aid he was willing to be to do and to &s;uffer ju&s;t what God plea&s;ed: and if it was the will of God to take his life, (tho' he could not con|&s;ider

him&s;elf a murderer) he was willing to die, and could not &s;ay he had any de&s;ire to live, tho' there was &s;omething &s;hocking to nature in death: yet it was a cup all mu&s;t drink.&mdash;About this time there ap|peared a vi&s;ible change in his countenance, which was ob&s;erved by &s;everal that vi&s;ited him: he ap|peared calm, compo&s;ed, plea&s;ant, affible, and ever after &s;o remained till his execution.</P>
<P>He &s;pent his whole time in reading, praying and in conver&s;ation on divine things.&mdash;He made &s;urpri&s;ing progre&s;s in the knowledge of &s;cripture, and &s;eem|ed as if he was able to unfold any my&s;terious pa&s;&s;age in the plaine&s;t manner.&mdash;He was much di&s;appointed in hearing the witne&s;&s;es again&s;t him at his trial: and after the witne&s;&s;es were heard, &s;ome of his friends who &s;eemed to have &s;ome knowledge of the unhappy affair, ob&s;erved to him &s;omething about perjury, he &s;aid don't mention &s;uch a thing: I hope they are not perjured wilfully, if they are I for|give them; they have not hurt me; I am willing to die. And when &s;ome of his relations &s;aid &s;ome|thing about a reprieve, he &s;aid no, they need not give them&s;elves any trouble about it; it was the will of God to call him out of the world in that way, and he hoped it would be to the glory of God, and the good of precious and immortal &s;ouls.</P>
<P>I was pre&s;ent when his father, mother, brothers and &s;i&s;ters and his wife came to take their la&s;t fare|wel of him; which &s;cene was truly affecting, and &s;ufficient to melt the harde&s;t heart, but e&s;pecially the parting with his wife; he in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing man|ner &s;et before her the joys to be obtained, and the mi&s;ery to be avoided by a &s;trict attention to re|ligion, and coming into the terms of &s;alvation; which he opened and explained, urging a compli|ance and as an engaging motive, (their affection be|ing great for each other) that then they &s;oon again &s;hould meet in tho&s;e happy regions where no &s;in nor &s;orrow can enter, to di&s;turb their happine&s;s, throughout <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> eternal duration. Ob&s;erving, if &s;he cho&s;e to follow him in the ways of holine&s;s,
<PB N="68" REF="023814_0068_0FC13A92AC6C44C8">
&s;he would find an admi&s;&s;ion into tho&s;e realms of bli&s;s, into which in a few hours he was going. He added, I am a dying man; you have been a kind wife; I mu&s;t leave you in the hands of a merciful God; farewel, till we meet again in a better would never to part.</P>
<P>When the &s;heriff came to call him to execution, he &s;eemed calm as he had been before.</P>
<P>It was with much difficulty that he wrote the fore|going pieces (his hands being in irons) and as they could not ea&s;ily be read, he de&s;ired me to copy them, and reque&s;ting al&s;o, that I would add his dying ex|hortation to the audience, at the gallows. He al&s;o left with me a few lines, in ver&s;e, to be added to his la&s;t and dying words.</P>
<P>As to what he &s;aid at his execution, as I was not pre&s;ent, and no per&s;on took notes of it, I have it not in power to give it at length&mdash;but from a paper found in his pocket after he was executed, which contained the heads of his la&s;t and dying words, it appears to have been a kind of abridgment of what he had wrote&mdash;earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ing an attention to religion as the great thing needful urged from various con&s;i|derations&mdash;al&s;o the great propriety of chu&s;ing good magi&s;trates, obeying them when cho&s;en, and the incumbent duty of every citizen to be obedient to the laws; and clo&s;ed with a &s;ervent prayer, well adapted to the &s;olemnity of the occa&s;ion&mdash;the la&s;t words of which were LORD JESUS! into thy hands I commit my &s;pirit.&mdash;And I think it may with truth be ob&s;erved, that, as in his conver&s;ation he &s;eemed to live in the lively expectation of a happy eternity&mdash;&s;o to all appearance, he died.</P>
<P>In his la&s;t conver&s;ation with his relations, he ob|&s;erved that the great and glorious doctrines of the go&s;pel were not held forth in their true light; but were by &s;ome of the preachers of the go&s;pel &s;o cloud|ed and ob&s;cured by metaphy&s;ical rea&s;onings, as to render them hard, if not impo&s;&s;ible; to be under&s;tood and received in the true &s;en&s;e held forth in the world; and often earne&s;tly wi&s;hed might it be in his power

to communicate his internal &s;en&s;e there of; which he had not received from man, by tradition and educa|tion, but from God, by the influence of his holy Spi|rit, and earne&s;tly directed them to have recour&s;e to the Spirit within their own hearts together with the &s;acred &s;criptures, and in that way by earne&s;t &s;eeking they could not fail to find: and that the way of &s;alvation would be opened clear and plain to them. And that following Chri&s;t, by keeping his command|ments, is the way in which he is to be found; for, &s;aith he, John viii, 12. I am the light of the world, he that followeth me &s;hall not walk in darkne&s;s;&mdash;vii. 17. If any man do his will he &s;hall know of the doctrine whether it be of God;&mdash;xiv. 23. If a man love me, he will keep my words and my Father will love him, and we will come in unto him and make our abode with him.&mdash;He often ob&s;erved that he did not believe that the &s;oul of man came immediately from God, as &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e, and when joined with the body was holy and clear of any &s;in: he believed that m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n con&s;i&s;ted of three parts. <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> &s;p;irit, &s;oul, and body: and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hat the &s;oul and body both by na|tural generation proceeded from Adam the fir&s;t parent, and were totally corrupted: and that the &s;piritual part was from God and is therefore pure and holy&mdash;and the following &s;criptures he thought proved his belief&mdash;Eccl&s;ia&s;te iii, 21. Who know|eth the &s;pirit of man that goeth upward; xii, 7. Then &s;hall the du&s;t return to the earth as it was and the &s;pirit &s;hall return to God who gave it.&mdash;Hebrews iv, 12.

For what man knoweth the things of a man, five the &s;pirit of man which is in him; even &s;o the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spi|rit of God.&mdash;The &s;oul of man and the &s;pirit he con&s;i|dered two very different things; by the &s;pirit, a &s;u|pernatural principle purcha&s;ed by the Saviour, and given for further improvement; repre&s;ented by the good &s;eed, the leaven, the grain of mu&s;turd &s;eed, the

And that this divine principle is com|municated to every man that cometh into the world; &amp; that as many go out of the world, at or near the in|&s;tant of their coming into it, then if all have it they mu&s;t have it a &s;oon as they come into the world, if not be|fore. And though this divine principle is in every heart yet to many it is of no u&s;e, becau&s;e they bu|ry it in the earth, and though like a live coal of fire wholly buried and covered under the a&s;hes, when found and &s;tirred up, begins to burn&punc; &s;o this divine principle becomes the ruling power; but if it is not found and improved the powerful principle of corrupt nature grows &s;tronger, the divine principle is buried deeper and deeper till it is wholly taken away&mdash;And that tho&s;e who never were favored with the light of outward revelation, have this divine princi|ple operating on many of them to their &s;alvation. <HI> Rev. v, 9. For thou wa&s;t &s;tain and ha&s;t redeemed us unto God by thy blood, out every kindred, tongue, people and nation.

<P>He often expre&s;&s;ed that if he could while under his conviction have received any &s;uch directions, as he hath been giving in his writing, he &s;hould have found great benefit therefrom: and from &s;uch con&s;iderati|ons, wi&s;hing to promote the good of immortal &s;ouls and lead them from their own works to the Spirit in the heart, and to induce them to attend to its in|ward teachings, and to convince them that &s;alvation is no where el&s;e to be found, and in no other way to be obtained&mdash;induced him to &s;pend &s;o much of his &s;hort time in writing&mdash;having not began writ|ing till after he received &s;entence of death. He of|ten ob&s;erved that having in his confinement been furni&s;hed with a piece on election and reprobation wrote by Mr. George Whitefield, in which he &s;ays, that they who believe in God's dooming men to ever|a&s;ting burning, al&s;o believe that God looked on
