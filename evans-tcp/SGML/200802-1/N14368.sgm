<OPENER><SALUTE>FRIENDS AND FELLOW-COUNTRYMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHILE I vent the fulne&s;s of my heart in the &s;incere&s;t congratulations of you and my&s;elf, and our common country, on the arrival of the au&s;picious day, which gives confirmed Sovereignty and Independence to confederate America, and pours into her bo&s;om the ble&s;&s;|ings of a &s;afe, advantageous, honorable PEACE, the charms of which are va&s;tly heightened and endeared to us by the horrid contra&s;t of an eight years' cruel War;&mdash; permit me at the &s;ame time to remind you, that the pro|fe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign of this &s;olemn a&s;&s;embly &s;hould give a religious direction to our common joy, and con&s;ecrate it into the livelie&s;t gratitude to that SUPREME POWER, who at once &s;tiles him&s;elf a MAN OF WAR, and the GOD OF PEACE. That the rapture of our hearts on &s;o glorious an occa&s;ion may be thus guided into a holy channel, and elevated into a pious tran&s;port of God-exalt|ing adoration and thank&s;giving&mdash;let us turn our con|templations to a noble pattern of this kind in the grateful, exulting Jews, on their liberation from the Babyloni&s;h captivity, as we have it exhibited in the
<Q><BIBL>126 PSALM, 3 fir&s;t Ver&s;es.</BIBL>
WHEN the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream. Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with &s;inging: then &s;aid they among the Heathen, the Lord hath done great things for them. The Lord hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad.</Q></P>
<P>AS the deliverance here celebrated by the church of God, was the mo&s;t illu&s;trious of any in the Old-Te&s;tament annals, and a mo&s;t remarkable type of our &s;piritual redemption by the Me&s;&s;iah; as many of its

leading circum&s;tances bear a &s;triking &s;imilarity to tho&s;e which have di&s;tingui&s;hed and dignified the &s;alvation of united America; and as their &s;entiments and acknow|ledgments upon it are &s;uch as remarkably &s;uit and become every American heart and tongue on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion; &mdash; let us therefore run over the affecting picture, which they them&s;elves give of the matter in the words now read: &mdash;in which they relate <HI>in the fir&s;t place</HI> the plea&s;ing, over-whelming SURPRISE that &s;eized their minds on fir&s;t re|ceiving the glorious tidings&mdash;"When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream" &mdash;As if they had &s;aid,&mdash;"The deliverance was &s;o great and glorious in it&s;elf, &s;o a&s;toni&s;hing in its circum&s;tances, &s;o &s;udden in its accompli&s;hment, &s;o unexpected and im|probable in every human view, &s;o far above our highe&s;t ideas and hopes, &s;o oppo&s;ite to our ju&s;t de&s;erts and appre|hen&s;ions&mdash;that we could &s;carce credit the te&s;timony of our own &s;en&s;es, and were ready to imagine the news of liberty no better than the plea&s;ing dream of a tran&s;ported, deluded fancy, or the airy, ba&s;ele&s;s fabrick of a midnight vi&s;ion." So Peter, when a cele&s;tial me&s;&s;enger knocked off his pri&s;on-chains, and brought him forth to liberty, was at fir&s;t &s;o &s;urpri&s;ed at the &s;udden, extraordinary deli|verance, that he could not believe it to be a waking reality, but only a vi&s;ionary picture painted on his imagination.&mdash; And doubtle&s;s the fir&s;t ideas and feelings of many an American heart, on the news of the equitable, liberal treaty of peace, ratified between Britain and the&s;e Sove|reign States, were nearly coincident with this de&s;cription: &mdash;for, the improbability of the haughty Monarch and Court of Britain's ever &s;ubmitting, (at lea&s;t at pre&s;ent,) to &s;uch mortifying conce&s;&s;ions, e&s;pecially of their adopting &s;o generous a &s;y&s;tem of policy, &s;o contradictory to the narrow, deceitful, underhanded, cruel politics, which, before, they had uniformly pur&s;ued towards this country; &mdash;the di&s;appointment of our &s;anguine pro&s;pects of pacifi|cation, in &s;ome former &s;tages of this conte&s;t;&mdash;the long continuance of our di&s;tre&s;&s;es;&mdash;the vi&s;ible growing dege|neracy and wickedne&s;s of America, under the judgments of Heaven, &s;ent and &s;o long continued for her correction and reformation&punc;&mdash;the&s;e, and many other di&s;couraging

ideas, combined their influence to render the glorious tidings of peace a very &s;urpri&s;ing, unexpected, overwhelm|ing &s;ound in the ears of many &s;ober Americans&mdash;a &s;ound too grand, good, joyful, to gain their ready confident belief&mdash;"Their rapture &s;eem'd a plea&s;ing dream, the grace appear'd &s;o great."</P>
<P>"Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with &s;inging"&mdash;The &s;urpri&s;e of &s;uch a deliverance produced an exta&s;y of joy; &s;o that we could &s;carce re&s;train our pa&s;&s;ions or our tongues within the bounds of decency or decorum. "Then &s;aid they among the Heathen, the Lord hath done great things for them." Tho&s;e Heathen neighbours, who had ob&s;erved and in&s;ulted the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, abject &s;tate of the&s;e captive exiles, were now con&s;trained to own the &s;uperintending, triumphant power, wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of Jehovah, in their &s;urpri&s;ing deliverance&mdash;in re&s;cuing his feeble I&s;rael out of the hands of their mighty oppre&s;&s;ors, when they were without friends, without re|&s;ources, without any enlivening hope or &s;pirit&mdash;in rai&s;ing up for them in this &s;ituation, and effecting their in&s;tant deliverance by a mo&s;t unlikely in&s;trument indeed, a Pagan, idolatrous Monarch, a &s;tranger and an enemy both by nation and religion, the King of that very empire, which held them in &s;ervitude as its legal, conquered captives, and e&s;teemed and treated them as the lowe&s;t dregs of mankind!&mdash;that &s;uch a Prince, without any human &s;oli|citation, without, yea, contrary to, any of the u&s;ual mo|tives of human policy, &s;hould proclaim the remains of poor, oppre&s;&s;ed I&s;rael, a <HI>free</HI> and <HI>independent</HI> nation, and furni&s;h them, out of his own trea&s;ures, with every requi&s;ite for the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment and &s;ecure enjoyment of their ancient privileges in their own land&mdash;this was &s;uch a &s;pectacle of divine wonders in behalf of that people, as extorted a confe&s;&s;ion from the mo&s;t &s;tupid idolaters, that Jehovah, the God of I&s;rael, was far &s;uperior to their idol-deities.&mdash;Ju&s;t &s;o, my brethren, the &s;ucce&s;sful &s;truggles of oppre&s;&s;ed America, at fir&s;t a feeble, naked, friendle&s;s in|fant, again&s;t the gigantic power of Britain, a nation then re&s;pectable and terrible to all the world for military prow|e&s;s, &s;trength and glory,&mdash;have di&s;played an augu&s;t &s;pectacle of divine manife&s;tations in our favour, which commands

the admiring attention of the world&mdash;All Europe, whe|ther Popi&s;h or Prote&s;tant, Chri&s;tian or Infidel, has be|held the advancing &s;tages of this conte&s;t with growing a&s;toni&s;hment:&mdash;and while our wonderful &s;ucce&s;s has given a lu&s;tre and dignity to our national character in the eyes of mankind, I doubt not but all &s;ober ob&s;ervers, and, one would think, all that are not abandoned Athei&s;ts, are con&s;trained to &s;ay, the Lord hath done great things for America. Even the poor Indian &s;avages around us, could make this remark on &s;ome great victory or deliverance granted to our pious, praying fathers&mdash;"Your God mu&s;t be a very great and good Spirit, to hear and an&s;wer your prayers in &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing a manner!"&mdash;If then Heathens, idolaters and &s;coffers are compelled to own a Superior Hand in the&s;e great events, with what eager, grateful tran&s;port &s;hould tho&s;e, in who&s;e behalf they are wrought, reply as in the next ver&s;e&mdash;"The Lord hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad"&mdash;He hath done great things FOR US&mdash;Our Heathen neighbours are only cool &s;pectators, but we are the feeling, happy &s;ubjects of the &s;urpri&s;ing mercy&mdash;"whereof we are glad":&mdash;our neigh|bours are &s;truck with amazement, and &s;ome of them filled with rage and vexation; but we are filled with grateful joy&mdash;a joy proportioned to the greatne&s;s of the ble&s;&s;ing, and the evidence we have that it flows from a God that is reconciled, and in friend&s;hip with his now penitent, puri|fied, reformed I&s;rael.&mdash;As I mean to make the pious a&s;cription in this third ver&s;e, the principal ba&s;is of the en&s;uing part of my di&s;cour&s;e, I &s;hall accordingly attempt to &s;hew,</P>
<P>FIRST, When the interpo&s;itions of Jehovah in favour of his people may be &s;tiled <HI>great,</HI> or what it is that &s;tamps them with this high character: which will naturally bring into view the principal events which have introduced and e&s;tabli&s;hed the American revolution. And then,</P>
<P>SECONDLY, Point out and enforce the manner, in which the happy &s;ubjects of &s;uch great divine manife&s;ta|tions, &s;hould entertain and improve them.</P>
<P>Re&s;pecting the FIRST HEAD, I would premi&s;e, that <HI>all</HI> the works of Jehovah are great, as being the products and di&s;plays of infinite perfection, and de&s;igned and adapted

to &s;ome very grand and excellent end:&mdash;particularly, all his acts of kindne&s;s to any of our fallen &s;pecies, are the fruits of a benevolence infinitely great, prompting and co-operating with equal knowledge and power. But though all God's benevolent works are in this re&s;pect equal, as proceeding from the &s;ame efficient and impul&s;ive Cau&s;e, yet the effects hereof, as terminating upon, and di&s;playing the divine goodne&s;s and other attributes to the view of the creature, are almo&s;t infinitely diver&s;ified: and in this view, &s;ome of the kind di&s;pen&s;ations of Heaven are va&s;tly, un&s;peakably greater than others. For in&s;tance, tho&s;e fruits of divine goodne&s;s, which have a very great intrin&s;ic worth&mdash;which carry in them a deliverance, or &s;ecurity from very great and terrible evils, and a compli|cation of many po&s;itive ble&s;&s;ings&mdash;which promi&s;e very durable advantages, or draw after them a long &s;eries of beneficial con&s;equences&mdash;which embrace great numbers of per&s;ons as joint-&s;harers in the important benefit&mdash;which triumph over mighty ob&s;tacles that lie in their way&mdash; which are conferred in an uncommon, unexpected, &s;udden, improbable, or peculiarly &s;ea&s;onable manner;&mdash;&s;uch ope|rations or effects of divine goodne&s;s, may be &s;tiled <HI>great</HI> in an emphatical and mo&s;t glorious &s;en&s;e. There was a &s;ignal concurrence of many of the&s;e heightening circum|&s;tances attending the liberation of the Jewi&s;h captives ce|lebrated in the text. But the divine manife&s;tations in favour of the&s;e United States, in which we this day re|joice, are eminently marked with <HI>all</HI> the&s;e dignifying characters &mdash;For the benefits granted, po&s;&s;e&s;s a va&s;t <HI>intrin&s;ic </HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> no le&s;s than INDEPENDENT LIBERTY, both civil and religious; the confirmed power of choo&s;ing our own government and wor&s;hip, of enacting our own laws, of acquiring and enjoying our own property, of regulating and extending our own commerce, and, in a word, of &s;ecurely and peaceably enjoying the mo&s;t valuable tempo|ral ble&s;&s;ings and &s;piritual privileges, in the greate&s;t and be&s;t country in the world! Will any &s;on or daughter of America, in the view of the&s;e precious gifts, now ratified to us by Heaven, venture to &s;peak in a contemptuous or murmuring tone, of the i&s;&s;ue of our long &s;truggle with Tyranny, as if we had reaped no other harve&s;t from it,

than the lo&s;s of a great deal of our choice&s;t blood, and an in&s;upportable weight of debt and of taxes for many years to come?&mdash;But what, my friends, are the&s;e &s;acrifices and inconveniences, compared with tho&s;e <HI>terrible evils,</HI> from which Heaven, by this conflict, has delivered and &s;ecured us?&mdash;compared with unconditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to a foreign legi&s;lature <HI>in all ca&s;es what&s;oever,</HI> which was expre&s;sly de|manded by the Briti&s;h Parliament, and attempted to be enforced by the whole military power of the nation&mdash;a demand, which, at one &s;troke, annihilated the very foun|dation of liberty in this country, and placed her in the lowe&s;t, ba&s;e&s;t &s;tate of va&s;&s;alage, without leaving to her the lea&s;t right or property in any in&s;tance whatever! And as complete &s;ervitude mu&s;t have been the immediate effect of a pa&s;&s;ive, non-re&s;i&s;ting &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to this de&s;potic claim; &s;o if Heaven had permitted them to &s;educe or conquer us into this &s;ubjection, after re&s;i&s;ting them with our arms, the con&s;equences mu&s;t have been &s;till more in&s;upportably dreadful:&mdash;for a conque&s;t would at once have made the Court of Britain both lords and landlords of this whole continent: and while our principal leaders, in the cabinet and field, would have been doomed to the block, or the gallows, the re&s;t of us, with our children, down perhaps to late po&s;terity, mu&s;t have been humble, cringing tenants and &s;laves, hewers of wood and drawers of water, to the haughty minions of Briti&s;h power! Let us &s;eriou&s;ly con|template, my brethren, the&s;e tremendous evils, which we had &s;o much rea&s;on to fear, together with tho&s;e we have actually felt from the di&s;appointed ambition and cruelty of our foes:&mdash;let our thoughts take a range through their polluted pri&s;on-&s;hips, and other murderous places of con|finement, which have &s;lain &s;o many of our de&s;erving &s;ons&mdash; let us vi&s;it the many populous towns wantonly con&s;umed, with the va&s;t amount of property pillaged or de&s;troyed, by their hands, with the many other traces of a ba&s;e, vindictive &s;pirit, which has marked their conduct towards us:&mdash;let us ca&s;t a retro&s;pective eye on the many awful &s;cenes of blood and carnage, of havock and depredation, with the long train of evils, both natural and moral, which compo&s;e War's gloomy retinue;&mdash;and then &s;ay, whether that event which puts a period to all the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es, pe|rils,

and fears, which anchors our political &s;hip in the harbour of &s;ecurity and peace, after having &s;o long en|countered the rage of &s;o tempe&s;tuous a &s;ea,&mdash;is not a very great and capital mercy of Heaven!&mdash;a mercy un&s;peak|ably enhanced and &s;weetned by the long and gloomy &s;cenes of trouble which have preceded and introduced it!&mdash;A mercy too of a very <HI>complicated</HI> kind, not only as it &s;aves us from &s;uch a complication of evils, but as it carries in its bowels, or naturally draws after it, a long chain of important <HI>po&s;itive</HI> ble&s;&s;ings, of <HI>exten&s;ive</HI> and <HI>permanent</HI> ad|vantages.&mdash;For be&s;ides the u&s;ual &s;weets and benefits of peace, accompanied with freedom, in the full &s;cope and animating encouragement it gives to indu&s;try, to arts, to &s;cience, to every noble, advantageous employment, im|provement, and gratification of life&mdash;be&s;ides the&s;e, the peaceful e&s;tabli&s;hment of our liberty and independence opens to us far more exten&s;ive and glorious pro&s;pects&mdash;it pre&s;ents us with a fair opportunity, with the noble&s;t in|ducements and advantages, for converting this immen&s;e northern continent into a &s;eat of knowledge and freedom, of agriculture and commerce, of u&s;eful arts and manu|factures, of Chri&s;tian piety and virtue, and thus making it an inviting and comfortable abode for many millions of the human &s;pecies, an a&s;ylum for the injured and oppre&s;&s;ed in all parts of the globe, the delight of God and good men, the joy and prai&s;e of the whole earth, &s;oaring on the wings of literature, wealth, population, religion, vir|tue, and every thing that is excellent and happy, to a greater height of perfection and glory than the world has ever yet &s;een.&mdash;It likewi&s;e opens a door for an exten&s;ive commercial intercour&s;e between us and all nations, and directly leads to a rapid increa&s;e of it among the various parts of the world: which is not only an inexhau&s;tible &s;ource of wealth and opulence, but tends to expand the human mind, to introduce a reciprocation of good offices and benefits, "a general knowledge of wants, and the means of &s;upplying them, an experimental acquaintance with the nece&s;&s;ity and beauty of ho&s;pitality, an univer&s;al enlargement of the habits of thinking," more rational ideas and a more liberal admini&s;tration of civil govern|ment, a better knowledge and reli&s;h of the &s;acred rights

of humanity; all which directly conduce to humanize, refine, and exalt the human mind and manners, and carry forward mankind to greater perfection and happine&s;s than have yet been attained.&mdash;Our late convul&s;ion, with its pre&s;ent happy termination, tends to wake up and encou|rage the dormant flame of liberty in all quarters of the earth; to rouze up an oppre&s;&s;ed, en&s;laved world from that &s;tupor which has &s;o long benumbed it&mdash;to rouze it to a due inquiry into the natural rights of men, and its own di&s;graceful and wretched &s;ituation in tamely &s;ubmit|ting to the deprivation of them; to open the eyes of kings and &s;ubjects to the true principles of liberty and ju&s;tice, and to the ab&s;urdity and iniquity of tyranny and per&s;e|cution in all their forms; and thus to lead mankind to a manly a&s;&s;ertion, and a happy recovery and re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of their civil and religious rights; and hereby open and prepare their minds for the more ea&s;y reception of the truth and grace of the go&s;pel.&mdash;Accordingly, every wheel of Providence &s;eems to be now in motion to ha&s;ten on the downfal of tyranny, of Popi&s;h &s;uper&s;tition and bi|gotry, and promote the cau&s;e of freedom, knowledge and truth:&mdash;The de&s;truction of the whole order of the Je&s;uits, who were the main prop of the Papal power; the aboli|tion of per&s;ecution in many European countries, particu|larly in <HI>France,</HI> where the pre&s;ent truly great and gene|rous Monarch has placed the Prote&s;tants on an equal foot|ing with his other &s;ubiects; and in <HI>Germany,</HI> where liberty of con&s;cience is granted to all peaceable &s;ubjects, of every denomination; the downfal of the helli&s;h Inqui&s;ition in <HI>Spain,</HI> and the liberal in&s;titutions which begin to take place in that country, &s;o remarkable, hitherto, for a blind, narrow, furious, per&s;ecuting bigotry; the &s;ecret contempt, in which almo&s;t all the learned and more knowing, in Po|pi&s;h countries, are &s;aid to hold the ab&s;urdities and fool|eries of that religion; the rapid progre&s;s of knowledge, and a &s;pirit of free inquiry, of late years, over the earth; &mdash;the&s;e and other &s;imilar events form a grand chain of Providence, in which the American Revolution is a prin|cipal link&mdash;a chain, which is gradually drawing after it the mo&s;t glorious con&s;equences to mankind; which is ha&s;tening on the accompli&s;hment of the &s;cripture-prophe|cies

relative to the <HI>Millenial State,</HI> the golden age of the church and world in the latter days.&mdash;How magnificently great do the works of Jehovah towards America appear, when viewed in this light!

<P>If we go on to apply the other characters of greatne&s;s enumerated above, relating to the manner in which di|vine favours are conferred, or deliverances wrought, we find them all emphatically verified in God's gracious ma|nife&s;tations towards America.

Was it not an extraordinary phenomenon in the political world, for &s;o many di&s;tinct and di&s;tant &s;tates, &s;o different in many re&s;pects in their education, laws, cu&s;toms, manners, pre|judices, and intere&s;ts,&mdash;not only to unite in one common cau&s;e, but to pre&s;erve and even &s;trengthen their union amid&s;t all the &s;erpentine, unwearied artifices of a &s;ubtle enemy to divide them; in&s;omuch that the very mea&s;ures they took to di&s;unite and de&s;troy us, have uniformly ope|rated to defeat their own de&s;igns and expectations? Was it not a very unu&s;ual &s;pectacle, to &s;ee &s;o young a country produce &s;uch a number of able, &s;pirited &s;tate&s;men and commanders, who&s;e abilities and patrioti&s;m, who&s;e equally judicious and vigorous mea&s;ures, have at once &s;aved their own country, and commanded the admiration and applau&s;e of the world?

My friends, while we contemplate this great character, placed at the head of our unexperienced forces, at &s;uch a criti|cal, &s;ea&s;onable juncture:&mdash;when we &s;urvey the bright con&s;tellation of heroes under him, the &s;ubordinate officers and &s;oldiers, who&s;e hard&s;hips, toils, dangers, battles, victo|ries&mdash;who&s;e triumphant patience, courage, and per&s;eve|rance, have in&s;trumentally procured the ble&s;&s;ings in which we now rejoice:&mdash;when we travel over the &s;everal bright &s;tages of this conte&s;t, from the bloody, yet victorious NINETEENTH OF APRIL, 1775, to the ever-memorable pre&s;ervation of our young troops, and de&s;truction of the veteran foe, at the battle of <HI>Bunker-hill;</HI> the brilliant, magnificent attacks and victories of <HI>Trenton</HI> and <HI>Princeton;</HI> the glorious capture of two whole Briti&s;h armies at <HI>Saratoga</HI> and <HI>Yorktown;</HI> the very critical detection and defeat of Ar|nold's black con&s;piracy, by a train of nice and &s;eemingly fortuitous incidents:&mdash;when to all this we add, the a&s;to|ni&s;hing magnanimity, genero&s;ity, and fidelity of the KING of France, the <HI>Cyrus</HI> of our I&s;rael, who&s;e paternal, liberal, effectual aid, afforded to us in our low e&s;tate, &s;o remark|ably re&s;embles the conduct of that ancient, noble Prince, whom Heaven in&s;pired, though an alien from their reli|gion, to proclaim and effect the great deliverance cele|brated by God's I&s;rael in the text:&mdash;when we further be|hold the top-&s;tone of this grand fabrick laid, in the ratifica|tion of a treaty of peace, which e&s;tabli&s;hes our unconditional independence, enlarges our territories, and gratifies our highe&s;t expectations and wi&s;hes:&mdash;and la&s;tly, when we reflect on the ill-de&s;erving, provoking character of the

people, in a moral view, for whom Jehovah has wrought all the&s;e wonders;&mdash;are we not con&s;trained to own with raptures of grateful admiration, that the Lord hath indeed done great things for us&mdash;that his perfections have tri|umphed gloriou&s;ly in our favour,&mdash;have triumphed not only over all the ho&s;tile attempts of our foes, but over all our own increa&s;ing and crying guilt?</P>
<P>What then remains but that we &s;uitably entertain and improve the&s;e a&s;toni&s;hing and endearing divine manife&s;t|ations in our favour? Which is the SECOND THING to be illu&s;trated and enforced.</P>
<P>It becomes us then, in the fir&s;t place, to a&s;cribe the whole glory of them to God, in imitation of the pious pattern of the text. This is nothing more than rendering to Jehovah his due:&mdash;this is a debt, which every &s;acred motive, every ingenuous principle, every tie of gratitude, decency, and equity, forcibly urges us to pay. For, &s;ound rea&s;on, as well as revelation, teaches us, that all the abi|lities, prowe&s;s, conduct and &s;ucce&s;s, which have guided and crowned our long conflict, have been derived from above&mdash;from the &s;ame Being, who rai&s;ed up Mo&s;es to lead his I&s;rael from their <HI>Egyptian</HI> bondage, and Cyrus to emancipate them from their <HI>Babylonian</HI> &s;ervitude. It was therefore a very fooli&s;h, as well as impious &s;peech of an European commander in a former war, <HI>that Providence always favours an hundred thou&s;and men;</HI> meaning, that notwith&s;tanding the influence of Providence, the &s;tronge&s;t army may be &s;ure of &s;ucce&s;s:&mdash;for there are a thou&s;and contingencies, which e&s;&s;entially affect the health, &s;upplies, coun&s;els, courage, operations and &s;ucce&s;s of an army, which no human &s;agacity can fore&s;ee, or human power controul, but which are wholly determined by an omni|&s;cient, omnipotent Providence. To the God of provi|dence then let us cou&s;ecrate the gladne&s;s of this happy day&mdash;let us return back to him, in devout a&s;criptions of prai&s;e, that full tide of joy, which He is pouring into our hearts&mdash;let us &s;ay, in the language of in&s;piration,&mdash;"I will &s;ing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriou&s;ly" &mdash;"O &s;ing unto the Lord a new &s;ong; for his right hand, and his holy arm hath gotten the victory"&mdash;"The Lord reigneth; let America&mdash;let the earth rejoice: let the multitude of the i&s;les be glad thereof."</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="018203_0013_0FA5BD315247A830">But while we religiou&s;ly adore the governing providence of Jehovah, and gratefully a&s;cribe to him all tho&s;e great events which &s;well our bo&s;oms with joy; let us beware that we do not impute the&s;e &s;ignal divine appearances in our favour, to any peculiar excellence in our national character. Alas, Sirs, the moral face of our country ef|fectually confutes &s;uch a vain-glorious &s;entiment. Crimes of the blacke&s;t hue&mdash;countle&s;s multitudes of abominations, mark the vi&s;ible character of this great, this highly fa|voured community, and &s;till provoke the di&s;plea&s;ure of Heaven; while they &s;erve as a foil to heighten and &s;et off the triumphant freene&s;s and riches of that goodne&s;s which has done &s;uch great things for &s;o unworthy a peo|ple: as on the other hand, the turpitude and guilt of our national provocations are exceedingly enhanced by tho&s;e glorious manife&s;tations of divine benevolence, again&s;t which they are committed. The pre&s;ent occa&s;ion then loudly calls us to mingle the mo&s;t humble penitence and contrition with our joyful gratitude and prai&s;e: and, in|deed, there can be no truly grateful and holy joy in the goodne&s;s of God, without true humility, repentance, and reformation, for its foundation, companion, and fruit: for humble, godly &s;orrow, and thankful joy, mutually beget, and &s;trengthen, and keep pace with each other; and no people, however highly favoured in external re&s;pects, have any &s;ure ground or warrant, or indeed any pre&s;ent moral capacity or meetne&s;s, for the exerci&s;e of true rejoicing in the divine goodne&s;s, while per&s;i&s;ting in an impenitent cour&s;e of rebellion again&s;t Him. The&s;e con&s;iderations call upon us to rejoice with trembling, with humility, with a &s;ober, cautious, &s;erious air, in oppo&s;ition to all levity, pride, vain-glory, &s;en&s;uality, carnal confidence and &s;ecurity. While we rejoice in the divine beneficence, let us remem|ber that for his own &s;ake he hath done the&s;e great things; not for any righteou&s;ne&s;s in us; not merely that we might enjoy the exultation of victory and peace, or the pride of independence and empire; but that his own name may be exalted, that his own great de&s;igns, hinted above, of glo|rifying Him&s;elf, and extending the kingdom of his Son, may be carried into effect: and though he has been u&s;ing us in the late revolution as in&s;truments of carrying forward

this glorious and benevolent plan, yet if we our&s;elves <HI>mean not &s;o,</HI>&mdash;if in our hearts and practice we are oppo&s;ed to his intere&s;t and glory&mdash;if we as a people continue to fight again&s;t Him, after &s;uch great di&s;plays as he has made of Him&s;elf before our eyes&mdash;if we abu&s;e the ble&s;&s;ings of returning peace and public felicity to greater wanton|ne&s;s in &s;in, to nouri&s;h a &s;pirit of pride, ambition, luxury, di&s;&s;ipation, venality, infidelity, and other concomitant vices; in this ca&s;e our very pro&s;perity will finally de&s;troy us in the mo&s;t aggravated manner; and God will promote the de&s;igns of his glory in our exemplary ruin, as he has now been doing in our &s;urpri&s;ing &s;alvation.&mdash;The&s;e ideas may well give a &s;olemnity to our joy, and cau&s;e it to flow in the channel, and bring forth the fruits, of true holine&s;s. O let us exhibit our prai&s;es, not in word only, but in deed and in truth: let us te&s;tify the cordial &s;incerity of our joys and thank&s;givings on this occa&s;ion, by a practical, &s;teady conformity and obedience to that great and good Being, whom we profe&s;s to extol: and let me add, by ge|nerous te&s;timonies of our e&s;teem and gratitude for tho&s;e, who&s;e toils, dangers, and &s;ufferings have eminently contri|buted to our pre&s;ent &s;ecurity and happine&s;s&mdash;let our grateful love to the infinite Author, flow down and flow out, in &s;uitable proportions, to the honored in&s;truments of the&s;e ine&s;timable benefits. Let tho&s;e men who have &s;tood forth in the foremo&s;t rank of danger, and made the greate&s;t private &s;acrifices to the public cau&s;e, whether in the &s;enate or in the field, whether at home or in foreign climes,&mdash;let the&s;e live in our hearts&mdash;let their names and heroic deeds live and &s;hine in our grateful annals, till time &s;hall be &s;wallowed up in eternity. Let us be eager to recompence their important labours of love for us and our children, for the unborn millions of our future de&s;cendants. Let us welcome the &s;uffering &s;oldier to the bo&s;om of a free and peaceful country, with tears of gratitude, and &s;miles of applau&s;e&mdash;let us gladly divide with him tho&s;e &s;weets of independence and wealth, which his gallantry and wounds have &s;ecured to us. Let us fly to &s;ooth the griefs, and wipe away the tears of the many widows and orphans, which this cruel war has made; and to relieve the mortifying di&s;tre&s;&s;es of poverty, into which it has plunged

Let us gladly contribute our &s;hare towards fulfilling the engagements of the public, to all that have credited or in any way a&s;&s;i&s;ted it, whether our own citizens or foreigners: and in&s;tead of complaining of the load of debt which lies upon us, let us ble&s;s God, that the great object of our long &s;truggle is obtained at &s;o cheap a rate;&mdash;that our burden, however pre&s;&s;ing, is light, compared either with the value of the acqui&s;ition or with the in&s;upportable load which mu&s;t have fallen upon us, and cru&s;hed us into ruin, had we been re-united to Great-Britain:&mdash;let us be willing to &s;acrifice the paltry, yet expen&s;ive plea&s;ures and parade of luxury, prodigality, vain magnificence, and other impoveri&s;hing, though fa&s;hionable vices, and practi&s;e frugality, indu&s;try, humility, and mo|deration, with the whole train of private and patriotic virtues: then, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, we may hope that our country will ere long be delivered from every embar|ra&s;&s;ing difficulty, which retards her progre&s;s towards the zenith of perfection, and will become an ample theatre for the la&s;t and mo&s;t glorious di&s;plays of the divine benevo|lence to the human &s;pecies.
