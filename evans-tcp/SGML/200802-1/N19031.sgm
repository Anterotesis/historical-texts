<HEAD>CONSIDERATIONS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IN an e&s;&s;ay upon the effects of public puni&s;hments upon criminals and upon &s;ociety, publi&s;hed in the &s;econd vo|lume of the American Mu&s;eum, I hinted, in a &s;hort para|graph, at the inju&s;tice of puni&s;hing murder by death. I &s;hall attempt in the following e&s;&s;ay, to &s;upport that opinion, and to an&s;wer all the objections that have been urged again&s;t it.</P>
<P>I. Every man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es an ab&s;olute power over his own li|berty and property, but not over his own life. When he becomes a member of political &s;ociety, he commits the di&s;|po&s;al of his liberty and property to his fellow citizens; but as he has no right to di&s;po&s;e of his life, he cannot commit the power over it to any body of men. To take away life, therefore, for any crime, is a violation of the fir&s;t political compact.</P>
<P>II. The puni&s;hment of murder by death, is contrary to rea&s;on, and to the order and happine&s;s of &s;ociety.</P>
<P N="1">1. It le&s;&s;ens the horror of taking away human life, and thereby tends to multiply murders.</P>
<P N="2">2. It produces murder, by its influence upon people who are tired of life, and who, from a &s;uppo&s;ition, that murder is a le&s;s crime than &s;uicide, de&s;troy a life (and often that of a near connexion) and afterwards deliver them&s;elves up to ju&s;tice, that they may e&s;cape from their mi&s;ery by means of a halter.</P>
<P N="3">3. The puni&s;hment of murder by death, multiplies mur|ders, from the difficulty it creates of convicting per&s;ons who are guilty of it. Humanity, revolting at the idea of the &s;everity and certainty of a capital puni&s;hment, often
<PB N="4" REF="024762_0003_0FCD623C8DF35D88">
&s;teps in, and collects &s;uch evidence in favour of a murder|er, as &s;creens him from ju&s;tice altogether, or palliates his crime into man&s;laughter. If the puni&s;hment of murder con&s;i&s;ted in long confinement, and hard labour, it would be proportioned to the mea&s;ure of our feelings of ju&s;tice, and every member of &s;ociety would be a watchman or a magi&s;|trate, to apprehend a de&s;troyer of human life, and to bring him to puni&s;hment.</P>
<P N="4">4. The puni&s;hment of murder by death, cheeks the ope|rations of univer&s;al ju&s;tice, by preventing the puni&s;hment of every &s;pecies of murder. Quack doctors&mdash;frauds of va|rious kinds&mdash;and a licentious pre&s;s, often de&s;troy life, and &s;ometimes with malice of the mo&s;t propen&s;e nature. If murder were puni&s;hed by confinement and hard labour, the authors of the numerous murders that have been mention|ed, would be dragged forth, and puni&s;hed according to their de&s;erts. How much order and happine&s;s would ari&s;e to &s;ociety from &s;uch a change in human affairs! But who will attempt to define the&s;e &s;pecies of murder, or to pro|&s;ecute offenders of this &s;tamp, if death is to be the puni&s;h|ment of the crime after it is admitted, and proved to be wilful murder?&mdash;only alter the puni&s;hment of murder, and the&s;e crimes will &s;oon a&s;&s;ume their proper names, and pro|bably &s;oon become as rare as murder from common acts of violence.</P>
<P N="5">5. The puni&s;hment of murder by death, has been proved to be contrary to the order and happine&s;s of &s;ociety by the experiments of &s;ome of the wi&s;e&s;t legi&s;lators in Europe. The empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, the king of Sweden, and the duke of Tu&s;cany, have nearly extirpated murder from their do|minions, by converting its puni&s;hment into the means of benefiting &s;ociety, and reforming the criminals who per|petrate it.</P>
<P>III. The puni&s;hment of murder by death, is contrary to divine revelation. A religion which commands us to forgive and even to do good to our enemies, can never authori&s;e the puni&s;hment of murder by death. "Vengeance is mine," &s;aid the Lord; "I will repay." It is to no purpo&s;e to &s;ay here, that this vengeance is taken out of the hands of an in|dividual, and directed again&s;t the criminal by the hand of government. It is equally an u&s;urpation of the prerogative of heaven, whether it be inflicted by a &s;ingle per&s;on, or by a whole community.</P>
<P>Here I expect to meet with an appeal from the letter and &s;pirit of the go&s;pel, to the law of Mo&s;es, which declares, that "he that killeth a man &s;hall &s;urely be put to death."
<PB N="5" REF="024762_0004_0FCD62404EEECCB8">
Forgive, indulgent heaven! the ignorance and cruelty of man, which by the mi&s;application of this text of &s;cripture, has &s;o long and &s;o often &s;tained the religion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t with folly and revenge.</P>
<P>The following con&s;iderations, I hope, will prove that no argument can be deduced from this law, to ju&s;tify the pu|ni&s;hment of murder by death. On the contrary, that &s;eve|ral arguments again&s;t it, may be derived from a ju&s;t and rational explanation of that part of the levitical in&s;titu|tions.</P>
<P N="1">1. There are many things in &s;cripture <HI>above,</HI> but nothing <HI>contrary</HI> to rea&s;on. Now, the puni&s;hment of murder by death, is <HI>contrary</HI> to rea&s;on. It cannot, therefore, be agreeable to the will of God.</P>
<P N="2">2. The order and happine&s;s of &s;ociety cannot fail of being agreeable to the will of God. But the puni&s;hment of mur|der by death, de&s;troys the order and happine&s;s of &s;ociety. It mu&s;t therefore be contrary to the will of God.</P>
<P N="3">3. Many of the laws given by Mo&s;es, were accommodated to the ignorance, wickedne&s;s, and "hardne&s;s of heart" of the Jews. Hence their divine legi&s;lator expre&s;sly &s;ays, "I gave them &s;tatutes that were <HI>not good,</HI> and judgments where|by <HI>they &s;hould not live.</HI>" Of this, the law which re&s;pects di|vorces, and the law of retaliation, which required "an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth," are remarkable in|&s;tances.</P>
<P>But we are told, that the puni&s;hment of murder by death, is founded not only on the law of Mo&s;es, but upon a po&s;i|tive precept given to Noah and his po&s;terity, that "who&s;o &s;heddeth man's blood, by man &s;hall his blood be &s;hed." In order to &s;how that this text does not militate again&s;t my propo&s;ition, I &s;hall beg leave to tran&s;cribe a pa&s;&s;age from an e&s;&s;ay on crimes and puni&s;hments, publi&s;hed by the reve|rend mr. Turner, in the &s;econd volume of the Manche&s;|ter memoirs. "I hope," &s;ays this ingenious author, "that I &s;hall not offend any one, by taking the liberty to put my own &s;en&s;e upon this celebrated pa&s;&s;age, and to enquire, why it &s;hould be deemed a precept at all. To me, I confe&s;s, it appears to contain nothing more than a declaration of what will generally happen; and in this view, to &s;tand ex|actly upon the &s;ame ground with &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages as the fol|lowing: "He that leadeth into captivity &s;hall go into cap|tivity." "He that taketh up the &s;word, &s;hall peri&s;h by the &s;word<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. xv, 10.</NOTE>."&mdash;The form of expre&s;&s;ion is exactly the &s;ame in
<PB N="6" REF="024762_0005_0FCD6243C166FE58">
each of the texts; why, then, may they not all be inter|preted in the &s;ame manner, and con&s;idered, not as com|mands, but as denunciations? and if &s;o, the magi&s;trate will be no more bound by the text in Gene&s;is, to puni&s;h murder with death, than he will by the text in the Revelations, to &s;ell every Guinea captain to our We&s;t India planters; and yet, however ju&s;t and proper &s;uch a proceeding might be, I &s;uppo&s;e no one will a&s;&s;ert that the magi&s;trate is bound to it by that, or any other text in the &s;criptures, or that that alone would be admitted as a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for &s;o extraordinary a mea&s;ure."</P>
<P>If this explanation of the precept given to Noah, be not &s;atisfactory, I &s;hall mention another. Soon after the flood, the infancy and weakne&s;s of &s;ociety rendered it impo&s;&s;ible to puni&s;h murder by <HI>confinement.</HI> There was therefore no medium between inflicting death upon a murderer, and &s;uf|fering him to e&s;cape with impunity, and thereby to perpe|trate more acts of violence again&s;t his fellow creatures. It plea&s;ed God in this condition of the world to permit a <HI>le&s;s</HI> in order to prevent a <HI>greater</HI> evil. He therefore commits <HI>for a while</HI> his exclu&s;ive power over human life, to his creatures for the &s;afety and pre&s;ervation of an infant &s;ociety, which might otherwi&s;e have peri&s;hed, and with it, the only &s;tock of the human race. The command indirectly implies that the crime of murder was not puni&s;hed by death in the ma|ture &s;tate of &s;ociety which exi&s;ted before the flood. Nor is this the only in&s;tance upon record in the &s;criptures in which God has delegated his power over human life to his creatures. Abraham expre&s;&s;es no &s;urpri&s;e at the command which God gave him to &s;acrifice his &s;on. He &s;ubmits to it as a precept founded in rea&s;on and natural ju&s;tice, for nothing could be more obvious than that the giver of life had a right to claim it <HI>when</HI> and in <HI>&s;uch manner</HI> as he plea&s;ed. 'Till men are able to give life, it becomes them to tremble at the thought of <HI>taking it</HI> away. Will a man rob God?&mdash;Yes&mdash;he robs him of what is infinitely dear to him&mdash;of his darling attribute of <HI>mercy,</HI> every time he deprives a fellow creature of life.</P>
<P N="4">4. If the Mo&s;aic law with re&s;pect to murder, be obligato|ry upon chri&s;tians, it follows that it is equally obligatory upon them to puni&s;h adultery, bla&s;phemy, and other capital crimes that are mentioned in the levitical law, by death. Nor is this all: it ju&s;tifies the extirpation of the Indians, and the en&s;laving of the Africans; for the command to the Jews to de&s;troy the Canaanites, and to make &s;laves of their heathen neighbours, is as po&s;itive as the command which
<PB N="7" REF="024762_0006_0FCD62455E8CB1A8">
declares, "that he that killeth a man, &s;hall &s;urely be put to death."</P>
<P N="5">5. Every part of the levitical law, is full of types of the Me&s;&s;iah. May not the puni&s;hment of death, inflicted by it, be intended to repre&s;ent the demerit and con&s;equences of &s;in, as the cities of refuge were the offices of the Me&s;&s;iah?</P>
<P N="6">6. The imperfection and &s;everity of the&s;e laws were Probably intended farther&mdash;to illu&s;trate the perfection and mildne&s;s of the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation. It is in this manner that God has manife&s;ted him&s;elf in many of his acts. He created darkne&s;s fir&s;t, to illu&s;trate by compari&s;on the beau|ty of light; and he permits &s;in, mi&s;ery, and death in the moral world, that he may hereafter di&s;play more illu&s;tri|ou&s;ly the tran&s;cendent glories of righteou&s;ne&s;s, happine&s;s, and immortal life. This opinion is favoured by St. Paul, who &s;ays, "the law made nothing perfect," and that "it was a &s;hadow of good things to come."</P>
<P>How delightful to di&s;cover &s;uch an exact harmony be|tween the dictates of rea&s;on, the order and happine&s;s of &s;ociety, and the precepts of the go&s;pel! There is a perfect unity in truth. Upon all &s;ubjects&mdash;in all ages&mdash;and in all countries&mdash;truths of every kind agree with each other.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that the common &s;en&s;e of all nations, and particularly of &s;avages, is in favour of puni&s;hing mur|der by death.</P>
<P>The common &s;en&s;e of all nations is in favour of the com|merce and &s;lavery of their fellow creatures. But this does not take away from their immorality. Could it be proved that the Indians puni&s;h murder by death, it would not e&s;|tabli&s;h the right of man over the life of a fellow creature, for revenge we know in its utmo&s;t extent is the univer&s;al and darling pa&s;&s;ion of all &s;avage nations. The practice moreover, (if it exi&s;t) mu&s;t have originated in <HI>nece&s;&s;ity;</HI> for a people who have no &s;ettled place of re&s;idence, and who are aver&s;e from all labour, could re&s;train murder in no other way. But I am di&s;po&s;ed to doubt whether the Indians puni&s;h murder by death among their own tribes. In all tho&s;e ca&s;es where a life is taken away by an Indian of a <HI>foreign</HI> tribe, they always demand the &s;atisfaction of <HI>life</HI> for <HI>life.</HI> But this practice is founded on a de&s;ire of pre&s;erving a balance in their numbers and power; for among nations which con&s;i&s;t of only a few warriors, the lo&s;s of an individual often de|&s;troys this balance, and thereby expo&s;es them to war or ex|termination. It is for the &s;ame purpo&s;e of keeping up an equality in numbers and power, that they often adopt cap|tive children into their nations and families. What makes
<PB N="8" REF="024762_0007_0FCD62466CC1DAF0">
this explanation of the practice of puni&s;hing murder by death among the Indians more probable, is, that we find the &s;ame bloody and vindictive &s;atisfaction is required of a foreign nation, whether the per&s;on lo&s;t, be killed by an accident, or by premeditated violence. Many facts might be mentioned from travellers to prove that the Indians do not puni&s;h murder by death within the juri&s;diction of their own tribes. I &s;hall mention only one which is taken from the rev. mr. John Megapolen&s;is's account of the Mo|hawk Indians, lately publi&s;hed in mr. Hazard's hi&s;torical collection of &s;tate papers.&mdash;"There is no puni&s;hment, (&s;ays our author) here for murder, but every one is his own avenger. The friends of the decea&s;ed revenge them&s;elves upon the murderer until peace is made with the next akin. But although they are &s;o cruel, yet there are not half &s;o many murders committed among them as among chri&s;tians, notwith&s;tanding their &s;evere laws, and heavy penalties."</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that the horrors of a guilty con&s;cience proclaim the ju&s;tice and nece&s;&s;ity of death, as a puni&s;hment for murder. I draw an argument of another nature from this fact. Are the horrors of con&s;cience the puni&s;hment that God inflicts upon murder? why, then, &s;hould we &s;horten or de&s;troy them by death, e&s;pecially as we are taught to direct the mo&s;t atrocious murderers to expect par|don in the future world? no, let us not counteract the go|vernment of God in the human brea&s;t: let the murderer live&mdash;but let it be to &s;uffer the reproaches of a guilty con&s;ci|ence: let him live, to make compen&s;ation to &s;ociety for the injury he has done it, by robbing it of a citizen: let him live to maintain the family of the man whom he has mur|dered: let him live, that the puni&s;hment of his crime may become univer&s;al: and la&s;tly let him live&mdash;that murder may be extirpated from the li&s;t of human crimes!</P>
<P>Let us examine the conduct of the moral Ruler of the world towards the fir&s;t murderer: &s;ee Cain return|ing from his field, with his hands reeking with the blood of his brother! Do the heavens gather blackne&s;s, and does a fla&s;h of lightning bla&s;t him to the earth? no. Does his father Adam, the natural legi&s;lator and judge of the world, inflict upon him the puni&s;hment of death?&mdash;No; the infinitely wi&s;e God becomes his judge and executioner. He expels him from the &s;ociety of which he was a member. He fixes in his con&s;cience a never-dying worm. He &s;ubjects him to the nece&s;&s;ity of labour; and to &s;ecure a duration of his puni&s;hment, proportioned to his crime, he puts a mark or prohibition upon him, to prevent his being put to death,
<PB N="9" REF="024762_0008_0FCD6247E4940B50">
by weak and angry men; declaring, at the &s;ame time, that "who&s;oever &s;layeth Cain, vengeance &s;hall be taken on him &s;even-fold."</P>
<P>Judges, attornies, witne&s;&s;es, juries and &s;heriffs, who&s;e of|fice it is to puni&s;h murder by death, I be&s;eech you to pau&s;e, and li&s;ten to the voice of rea&s;on and religion, before you convict or execute another fellow-creature for murder!</P>
<P>But I de&s;pair of making &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon the pre&s;ent citizens of the united &s;tates, as &s;hall aboli&s;h the ab|&s;urd and unchri&s;tian practice. From the connexion of this e&s;&s;ay with the valuable documents of the late revolution contained in the American Mu&s;eum, it will probably de|&s;cend to po&s;terity. To you, therefore, the unborn genera|tions of the next century, I con&s;ecrate this humble tribute to ju&s;tice. You will enjoy in point of knowledge, the meri|dian of a day, of which we only perceive the twilight. You will often review with equal contempt and horror, the in|dolence, ignorance and cruelty of your ance&s;tors. The gro&s;&s;e&s;t crimes &s;hall not exclude the perpetrators of them from your pity. You will <HI>fully</HI> comprehend the extent of the di&s;coveries and precepts of the go&s;pel, and you will be acquired, I hope, by its gentle and forgiving &s;pirit. You will &s;ee many modern opinions in religion and government turned up&s;ide downwards, and many new connexions e&s;ta|bli&s;hed between cau&s;e and effect. From the importance and de&s;tiny of every human &s;oul, you will acquire new ideas of the dignity of human nature, and of the infinite value of every act of benevolence that has for its object, the bodies, the &s;ouls, and the lives of your fellow-creatures. You will love the whole human race, for you will perceive that you have a common Father, and you will learn to imitate how by converting tho&s;e puni&s;hments to which their folly or wickedne&s;s have expo&s;ed them, into the means of their re|formation and happine&s;s.</P>

<P><HI>SOON after the above enquiry was publi&s;hed in the American Mu&s;eum, a reply to it made its appearance in the Penn&s;ylva|nia Mercury, under the &s;ignature of</HI> Philochoras; <HI>which pro|duced the following an&s;wer. The principal arguments in fa|vour of puni&s;hing murder by death, contained in the reply, are mentioned in the an&s;wer, for which rea&s;on it was not thought nece&s;&s;ary to re-publi&s;h the whole of the reply in the order in which it appeared in the news paper.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="reply">
<HEAD>FROM THE AMERICAN MUSEUM.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MR. CAREY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE read a reply &s;ub&s;cribed Philochoras, to an en|quiry into the ju&s;tice and policy of puni&s;hing murder by death, publi&s;hed &s;ome time ago in the Mu&s;eum. The author of it has attempted to ju&s;tify public and capital puni&s;hments, as well as war, by the precepts of the go&s;pel.&mdash;Let not my readers &s;uppo&s;e that this author is a &s;ceptic&mdash;or a hea|then&mdash;or that he is in any degree unfriendly to chri&s;tiani|ty. Far from it&mdash;he is a mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel&mdash;and a man of a worthy private as well as public character.</P>
<P>Our author begins his reply by a&s;&s;erting, that the objec|tion to the puni&s;hment of death for murder, proceeded ori|ginally from the &s;ocinian objection to the great doctrine of the atonement. Here I mu&s;t acknowledge my obligations to our author for having furni&s;hed me with a new argument in favour of my principles. I believe in the doctrine of the atonement, not only becau&s;e it is clearly revealed in the old and new te&s;taments, but becau&s;e it is agreeable to na|ture, and rea&s;on. Life is the product of death, through|out every part of the animal creation. Rea&s;on likewi&s;e e&s;|tabli&s;hes the nece&s;&s;ity of the atonement, for it has lately taught us in the writings of the marquis of Beccaria, that in a perfect human government there &s;hould be <HI>no pardoning power:</HI> and experience has taught us that where <HI>certainly</HI> has taken the place of <HI>&s;everity</HI> of pu|ni&s;hment, crimes have evidently and rapidly dimini&s;hed in every country. The demands of the divine law which made the &s;hedding of blood nece&s;&s;ary to the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;in, is a &s;ublime illu&s;tration of the perfection of the divine government, and of the love of the Supreme Being to his intelligent creatures. But in the demand <HI>of life</HI> for di&s;obedience, let the divine law &s;tand alone. Men &s;tand in a very different relation to each other, from
<PB N="11" REF="024762_0010_0FCD624C8A45F970">
that which God &s;u&s;tains to men. They are all falli|ble, and deficient in a thou&s;and duties which they owe to each other. They are bound, therefore, by the pre|cept of doing to others, as they would have them do them, to <HI>forgive,</HI> without a &s;atisfaction, ina&s;much as they con|&s;tantly require the &s;ame <HI>forgivene&s;s</HI> to be exerci&s;ed towards them&s;elves. To puni&s;h murder, therefore, or any other crime, by death, under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, is to exalt the angry and vindictive pa&s;&s;ions of men to an equality with the perfect law of God. It is to place imperfect indi|viduals and corrupted human governments, upon the throne of the righteous judge of the univer&s;e: nay, more&mdash;it is to make the death of Chri&s;t of no effect; for every time we puni&s;h murder by death, we practically deny that it was a full expiation for every &s;in, and thereby exclude our&s;elves from deriving any benefit from it, for he has made the for|givene&s;s of injuries, without any exceptions, whether com|mitted again&s;t us in our private capacities, or as members of a community, the <HI>expre&s;s condition</HI> of our title to the forgive|ne&s;s which he has purcha&s;ed for us by his death.</P>
<P>The arguments again&s;t the puni&s;hment of murder by death, from <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> remain on an immoveable foundation. Our author has <HI>contradicted</HI>&mdash;but has not <HI>refuted</HI> one of them. I affirmed in my former e&s;&s;ay, that the puni&s;hment of murder by death had been aboli&s;hed in &s;everal of the European nations. I wi&s;h for the honour of our author's profe&s;&s;ion, he had doubted of this a&s;&s;ertion with more of the meek and gentle &s;pirit of a chri&s;tian. To &s;atisfy him upon this &s;ubject, I &s;hall &s;ubjoin the following extracts from authorities which are now before me.&mdash;In the in&s;tructions to the commi&s;&s;ioners appointed to frame a new code of laws for the Ru&s;&s;ian empire, by Catharine II. the pre&s;ent empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, I find the following pa&s;&s;age.

<P>"Proofs from facts demon&s;trate to us, that the frequent u&s;e of capital puni&s;hments, never mended the morals of a people. Therefore, if I prove the death of a citizen to be neither <HI>u&s;eful</HI> nor <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> to &s;ociety in general, I &s;hall con|fute tho&s;e who ri&s;e up again&s;t humanity. In a reign of peace and tranquillity, under a government e&s;tabli&s;hed with the united wi&s;hes of a whole people, in a &s;tate well fortifi|ed again&s;t external enemies, and protected within by &s;trong &s;upports; that is, by its own internal &s;trength, and virtu|ous &s;entiments, rooted in the minds of the citizens, there

can be <HI>no nece&s;&s;ity</HI> for <HI>taking away the life</HI> of a citizen. It is not the <HI>exce&s;s</HI> of &s;everity, nor the <HI>de&s;truction</HI> of the human &s;pecies, that produces a powerful effect upon the hearts of the citizens, but the <HI>continued duration</HI> of the puni&s;hment. The death of a malefactor is not &s;o efficacious a method of deferring from wickedne&s;s, as the example continually re|maining, of a man who is deprived of his liberty, that he might repair, during a life of labour, the injury he has done to the community. The terror of death excited by the imagination may be more <HI>&s;trong,</HI> but has not force enough to re&s;i&s;t that <HI>oblivion</HI> which is &s;o natural to mankind. It is a general rule, that rapid and violent impre&s;&s;ions upon the hu|man mind, di&s;turb and <HI>give pain,</HI> but do not operate long up|on the <HI>memory.</HI> That a puni&s;hment, therefore, might be con|formable with ju&s;tice, it ought to have &s;uch a degree of &s;e|verity as might be &s;ufficient to deter people from commit|ting the crime. Hence I pre&s;ume to affirm, that there is no man who, upon the lea&s;t degree of reflexion, would put the <HI>greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible</HI> advantages, he might flatter him&s;elf from a crime, on the <HI>one &s;ide,</HI> into the balance again&s;t a life <HI>pro|tracted</HI> under a <HI>total</HI> privation of liberty, <HI>on the other.</HI>"</P>
<P>In a Briti&s;h review for the pre&s;ent year, I find a &s;hort ac|count of the code of penal laws lately enacted by the em|peror of Germany. This enlightened monarch has divided impri&s;onment into <HI>mild</HI>&mdash;<HI>&s;evere</HI>&mdash;and <HI>rigorous.</HI> For the crime of murder, he inflicts the puni&s;hment of rigorous impri|&s;onment&mdash;which from its duration, and other terrifying circum&s;tances that attend it, is calculated to produce more beneficial effects in preventing murders, than all the execu|tions that have ever taken place in any age or country.</P>
<P>I derived my information of the abolition of capital pu|ni&s;hment in Sweden and Tu&s;cany, from two foreigners of di&s;tinction, who lately vi&s;ited the united &s;tates. The one was an Italian nobleman, the other was a captain in the Swedi&s;h navy&mdash;both of whom commanded every where re|&s;pect and attachment for their abilities and virtues.</P>
<P>It is true, this happy revolution in favour of ju&s;tice and humanity, in the in&s;tances that have been mentioned, did not originate in a convocation or a &s;ynod. It may either be a&s;cribed to the light of the go&s;pel &s;hining in "darkne&s;s, which comprehended it not"&mdash;or to the influence of &s;ound and cultivated rea&s;on&mdash;for rea&s;on and religion have the &s;ame objects. They are in no one in&s;tance oppo&s;ed to each other. On the contrary, rea&s;on is nothing but imperfect re|ligion, and religion is nothing but perfect rea&s;on.</P>

the popular virtue of humanity, becau&s;e it is recommend|ed by dei&s;ts, or by per&s;ons who do not profe&s;s to be bound by the &s;trict obligations of chri&s;tianity.&mdash;Voltaire fir&s;t taught the princes of Europe the duty of religious tolera|tion. The duke of Sully has demon&s;trated the extreme fol|ly of war, and has proved that when it has been conducted with the mo&s;t glory, it never added an atom to national happine&s;s. The marquis of Beccaria has e&s;tabli&s;hed a con|nexion between the abolition of capital puni&s;hments, and the order and happine&s;s of &s;ociety. Should any thing be found in the &s;criptures, <HI>contrary</HI> to the&s;e di&s;coveries, it is ea&s;y to fore&s;ee that the principles of the dei&s;ts and the laws of modern legi&s;lators will &s;oon have a <HI>ju&s;t</HI> preference to the principles and precepts of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Our author attempts to &s;upport his &s;anguinary tenets by an appeal to revelation. And here I &s;hall make two preli|minary remarks.</P>
<P N="1">1. There is no opinion &s;o ab&s;urd or impious, that may not be &s;upported by <HI>&s;olitary</HI> texts of &s;cripture. To collect the <HI>&s;en&s;e</HI> of the bible upon any &s;ubject, we mu&s;t be governed by its <HI>whole</HI> &s;pirit and tenor.</P>
<P N="2">2. The de&s;ign of chri&s;tianity at its fir&s;t promulgation was to reform the world by its <HI>&s;pirit</HI> rather than by its po&s;i|tive precepts.</P>
<P>Our Saviour does not forbid &s;lavery in direct terms&mdash;but he indirectly bears a te&s;timony again&s;t it, by command|ing us to do to others what we would have them in like cir|cum&s;tances to do to us. He did not aim to produce a &s;udden revolution in the affairs of men. He knew too well the Power and efficacy of his religion for that purpo&s;e. It was unnece&s;&s;ary, therefore, to &s;ubject it to additional oppo&s;i|tion, by a direct attack upon the prejudices and intere&s;ts of mankind, both of which were clo&s;ely interwoven with the texture of their civil governments.</P>
<P>After the&s;e remarks, I &s;hall only add, that the declara|tion of St. Paul before Fe&s;tus, re&s;pecting the puni&s;hment of death<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"For if I be an offender, and have committed any thing worthy of death, I refu&s;e not to die." Acts 25 and 11.</NOTE> and the &s;peech of the dying thief on the cro&s;s<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">"We indeed" &s;uffer <HI>"ju&s;tly,</HI> for we receive the due reward of our deeds." Luke 23 and 41.</NOTE>, only prove that the puni&s;hment of death was agreeable to the Roman law, but they by no means prove that they were &s;anctioned by the go&s;pel.&mdash;Human life was extremely
<PB N="14" REF="024762_0013_0FCD62510410B5E0">
cheap under the Roman government. Of this we need no further proof than the head of John the bapti&s;t forming a part of a royal entertainment. From the frequency of Public executions, among tho&s;e people, the <HI>&s;word</HI> was con&s;i|dered as an emblem of public ju&s;tice&mdash;but to &s;uppo&s;e from this appeal to a &s;ign of ju&s;tice, or from our Saviour's para|ble of the de&s;truction of the hu&s;bandmen, that capital pu|ni&s;hments are approved of in the new te&s;tament, is as ab|&s;urd as it would be to &s;uppo&s;e that hor&s;eracing was a chri&s;|tian exerci&s;e, from St. Paul's frequent allu&s;ions to the Olym|pic games.</P>
<P>The declaration of the barbarians upon &s;eeing the &s;nake fa&s;ten upon St. Paul's hand proves nothing but the igno|rance of tho&s;e uncivilized people. I deny the con&s;ent of all nations to the puni&s;hment of death for murder&mdash;but if it were true&mdash;it only proves the univer&s;ality of the igno|rance and depravity of man. Revenge, di&s;&s;imulation, and even theft, prevail among all the nations in the world,&mdash;and yet who will dare to a&s;&s;ert, that the&s;e vices are ju&s;t, or nece&s;&s;ary to the order or happine&s;s of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Our author does not di&s;tingui&s;h between the &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice &s;o univer&s;al among all nations, and an approbation of death as a puni&s;hment for murder. The former is writ|ten by the finger of God upon every human heart, but like his own attribute of ju&s;tice, it has the happine&s;s of individuals and of &s;ociety for its objects. It is always mi&s;led, when it &s;eeks for &s;atisfaction in puni&s;hments that are injurious to &s;ociety, or that are di&s;proportioned to crimes. The &s;atisfaction of this univer&s;al &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice by the pu|ni&s;hments of impri&s;onment and labour, would far exceed that which is derived from the puni&s;hment of death; for it would be of longer duration, and it would more frequently occur, for, upon a principle laid down in the fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay upon this &s;ubject, &s;carcely any &s;pecies of murder would e&s;cape with impunity.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;cale of puni&s;hments by means of impri&s;onment and labour might ea&s;ily be contrived, &s;o as to be accommo|dated to the different degrees of atrocity in murder. For example&mdash;for the fir&s;t or highe&s;t degree of guilt, let the puni&s;hment be &s;olitude and darkne&s;s, and a total <HI>want</HI> of employment. For the &s;econd, &s;olitude and labour, with the benefit of light. For the third, confinement and labour. The <HI>duration</HI> of the&s;e puni&s;hments &s;hould likewi&s;e be go|verned by the atrocity of the murder, and by the &s;igns of contrition and amendment in the criminal.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="024762_0014_0FCD6252B1349A78">
The conduct and di&s;cour&s;es of our Saviour &s;hould out|weigh every argument that has been or can be offered in favour of capital puni&s;hment for any crime. When the wo|man caught in adultery was brought to him, he evaded in|flicting the bloody &s;entence of the Jewi&s;h law upon her. Even the <HI>maiming</HI> of the body appears to be offen&s;ive in his &s;ight, for when Peter drew his &s;word and &s;mote off the ear of the &s;ervant of the high prie&s;t, he replaced it by miracle, and at the &s;ame time declared, that "all they who take the &s;word, &s;hall peri&s;h with the &s;word." He for|gave the crime of murder, on his cro&s;s; and after his re&s;ur|rection, he commanded his di&s;ciples to preach the go&s;pel of forgivene&s;s <HI>fir&s;t</HI> at Jeru&s;alem, where he well knew his murderers &s;till re&s;ided. The&s;e &s;triking facts are recorded for our imitation, and &s;eem intended to &s;how that the Son of God died, not only to reconcile God to man, but to re|concile men to each other. There is one pa&s;&s;age more, in the hi&s;tory of our Saviour's life, which would of it&s;elf over&s;et the ju&s;tice of the puni&s;hment of death for murder, if every other part of the bible had been &s;ilent upon the &s;ubject. When two of his di&s;ciples, actuated by the &s;pirit of vindictive legi&s;lators, reque&s;ted permi&s;&s;ion of him to call down fire from heaven to con&s;ume the inho&s;pitable Sama|ritans, he an&s;wered them "the Son of man is not come to <HI>de&s;troy</HI> men's <HI>lives,</HI> but to <HI>&s;ave</HI> them." I wi&s;h the&s;e words compo&s;ed the motto of the arms of every nation upon the face of the earth. They inculcate every duty that is calculat|ed to pre&s;erve&mdash;re&s;tore&mdash;or prolong human life. They mili|tate alike again&s;t war&mdash;and capital puni&s;hments&mdash;the objects of which are the unprofitable de&s;truction of the lives of men. How precious does a human life appear from the&s;e words, in the &s;ight of heaven! Pau&s;e, legi&s;lators, when you give your votes for inflicting the puni&s;hment of death for any crime You fru&s;trate, in one in&s;tance, the de&s;ign of the mi&s;&s;ion of the Son of God into the world, and thereby either deny his appearance in the fle&s;h, or reject the truth of his go&s;pel. You moreover &s;trengthen by your conduct the ar|guments of the dei&s;ts and &s;ocinians again&s;t the particular doctrines of the chri&s;tian revelation. You do more&mdash;you pre|&s;erve a bloody fragment of the Jewi&s;h in&s;titution. "The Son of man came not to <HI>de&s;troy</HI> men's lives, but to <HI>&s;ave</HI> them." Excellent words! I require no others to &s;atisfy me of the truth and divine original of the chri&s;tian religion, and while I am able to place a finger upon this text of &s;cripture, I will not believe an angel from heaven, &s;hould
<PB N="16" REF="024762_0015_0FCD62568159A848">
he declare that the puni&s;hment of death for <HI>any</HI> crime was inculcated, or permitted by the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that a man who has committed a mur|der, has di&s;covered a malignity of heart, that renders him ever afterwards unfit to live in human &s;ociety. This is by no means true in many, and perhaps in mo&s;t of the ca&s;es of murder. It is mo&s;t frequently the effect of a &s;udden gu&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion, and has &s;ometimes been the only &s;tain of a well &s;pent or inoffen&s;ive life. There are many crimes which unfit a man much more for human &s;ociety, than a &s;ingle murder, and there have been in&s;tances of murderers who have e&s;caped or bribed the laws of their country, who have afterwards become peaceable, and u&s;eful mem|bers of &s;ociety. Let it not be &s;uppo&s;ed that I wi&s;h to pal|liate by this remark, the enormity of murder. Far from it. It is only becau&s;e I view murder with &s;uch &s;uperlative horror, that I wi&s;h to deprive our laws of the power of perpetrating and encouraging it.</P>
<P>Our author has furni&s;hed us with a number of tales to &s;how that the providence of God is concerned in a pecu|liar manner in detecting murder, and that the confe&s;&s;ions of murderers have in many in&s;tances &s;anctified the ju&s;tice of their puni&s;hment. I do not wi&s;h to le&s;&s;en the influence of &s;uch vulgar errors as tend to prevent crimes, but I will venture to declare, that many more murderers e&s;cape di&s;|covery, than are detected, or puni&s;hed. Were I not afraid of tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing upon the patience of my readers, I might mention a number of facts, in which circum&s;tances of the mo&s;t trifling nature have become the means of detecting theft and forgery, form which I could draw as &s;trong proofs of the watchfulne&s;s of providence over the property of individuals, and the order of &s;ociety, as our author has drawn from the detection of murder. I might mention in|&s;tances, likewi&s;e, of per&s;ons in whom con&s;cience has pro|duced re&s;titution for &s;tolen goods, or confe&s;&s;ion of the ju&s;|tice of the puni&s;hment which was inflicted for theft. Con|&s;cience and knowledge always keep pace with each other, both with re&s;pect to divine and human laws. A party of &s;oldiers in the duke of Alva's army, murdered a man and his wife with &s;ix children. They roa&s;ted the younge&s;t child, and dined upon it. One of them after dinner clapped his hands together, and with great agitation of mind cried out "good God&mdash;what have I done?"&mdash;What? &s;aid one of his companions&mdash;"why" &s;aid the other "I have eaten fle&s;h in lent time." Here con&s;cience kept pace with his degrees of knowledge. The &s;ame thing occurs upon different occa&s;ions
<PB N="17" REF="024762_0016_0FCD62579A07F890">
every day. The acquie&s;cence of murderers in the ju&s;tice of their execution, is the effect of prejudice and education. It cannot flow from a con&s;cience acting in concert with rea&s;on or religion&mdash;for they both &s;peak a very different language.</P>
<P>The world has certainly undergone a material change for the better within the la&s;t two hundred years. This change has been produced chiefly, by the &s;ecret and un|acknowledged influence of chri&s;tianity upon the hearts of men. It is agreeable to trace the effects of the chri&s;tian re|ligion in the extirpation of &s;lavery&mdash;in the diminution of the number of capital puni&s;hments, and in the mitigation of the horrors of war. There was a time when ma&s;ters po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed a power over the lives of their &s;laves. But chri&s;tianity has depo&s;ed this power, and mankind begin to &s;ee every where that &s;lavery is alike contrary to the intere&s;ts of &s;oci|ety, and the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel. There was a time when tor|ture was part of the puni&s;hment of death, and when the number of capital crimes amounted to one hundred and &s;ix|ty-one. Chri&s;tianity has aboli&s;hed the former, and reduced the latter to not more than &s;ix or &s;even. It has done more. It has confined in &s;ome in&s;tances capital puni&s;hments to the crime of murder only&mdash;and in &s;ome countries it has aboli&s;h|ed it altogether. The influence of chri&s;tianity upon the modes of war has been &s;till more remarkable. It is agreea|ble to trace its progre&s;s.</P>
<P>1&s;t. In re&s;cuing women and children from being the ob|jects of the de&s;olations of war in common with men.</P>

<P>6thly. In declaring all wars to be unlawful but &s;uch as are purely <HI>defen&s;ive.</HI></P>
<P>This is the only tenure by which war now holds its place among chri&s;tians. It requires but little ingenuity to prove that a defen&s;ive war cannot be carried on &s;ucce&s;sfully without offen&s;ive operations. If this be true, then this la&s;t degree of it, upon our author's principles, mu&s;t be contrary to the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel. Already the princes and nations of the world di&s;cover the &s;truggles of opinion or con&s;cience in
<PB N="18" REF="024762_0017_0FCD6259114A54A0">
their preparations for war. Witne&s;s, the many national di&s;putes which have been lately terminated in Europe by negociation, or mediation. Witne&s;s, too, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the con&s;titution of the united &s;tates without force or blood&s;hed. The&s;e events indicate an improving &s;tate of hu|man affairs. They lead us to look forward with expectation to the time, when the weapons of war &s;hall be changed into implements of hu&s;bandry, and when rapine and violence &s;hall be no more. The&s;e events are the promi&s;ed fruits of the go&s;pel. If they do not come to pa&s;s, the prophets have deceived us. But if they do&mdash;war mu&s;t be as contrary to the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel, as fraud, or murder, or any other of the vices which are reproved or extirpated by it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;pirit of chri&s;tianity which our author de&s;cribey as a vulgar dei&s;tical &s;pecies of humanity, has found its was into &s;chools and families, and has aboli&s;hed, in both, corpo|ral and ignominious puni&s;hments. In the in&s;tructions to the ma&s;ters and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of the &s;undry &s;chools, I ob&s;erve with great plea&s;ure a direction "to u&s;e corporal pun&s;hments as &s;eldom as po&s;&s;ible."</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I cannot take leave of this &s;ubject without remarking that capital puni&s;hments are the natural offspring of mo|narchical governments. Kings believe that they po&s;&s;e&s;s their crowns by a <HI>divine</HI> right: no wonder, therefore, they a&s;|&s;ume the divine power of taking away human life. Kings con&s;ider their &s;ubjects as their property: no wonder, there|fore, they &s;hed their blood with as little emotion as men &s;hed the blood of their &s;heep or cattle. But the principles of republican governments &s;peak a very different language. They teach us the ab&s;urdity of the divine origin of kingly power. They approximate the extreme ranks of men to each other. They re&s;tore man to his God&mdash;to &s;ociety&mdash;and to him&s;elf. They revive and e&s;tabli&s;h the relations of fellow-citizen, friend, and brother. They appreciate hu|man life, and increa&s;e public and private obligations to pre&s;erve it. They con&s;ider human &s;acrifices as no le&s;s of|fen&s;ive to the &s;overeignty of the people, than they are to the maje&s;ty of heaven. They view the attributes of govern|ment, like the attributes of the deity, as infinitely more ho|noured by de&s;troying evil by means of <HI>merciful</HI> than by exterminating puni&s;hments. The united &s;tates have adopt|ed the&s;e peaceful and benevolent forms of government. It becomes them therefore to adopt their mild and benevolent
<PB N="19" REF="024762_0018_0FCD625ADEBD6E38">
principles. An execution in a republic is like a human &s;a|crifice in religion. It is an offering to monarchy, and to that malignant being, who has been &s;tiled a murderer from the beginning, and who delights equally in murder, whe|ther it be perpetrated by the cold, but vindictive arm of the law, or by the angry hand of private revenge.</P>
