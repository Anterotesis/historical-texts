<P>THrough the tender Mercies of Al|mighty God, being returned, on this Anniver&s;ary, and great Occa&s;ion, to this principal Seat of the Govern|ment, we are met together in this his Hou&s;e, pur&s;uant to the laudable In&s;titution and U&s;age of our devout Predece&s;&s;ors, to give Thanks to his Holy Name, to view the Beauty of the Lord, and inquire as in his Holy Temple.</P>

And if it be thus, certainly it was but a very becoming Acknowledgement and Return made to the great Ruler of the World, in who&s;e Hands his own times were, and by whom his Changes were ordered, to go into the general Re&s;olve he here makes, which is the Imitation of the Divine Clemency and Cha&s;ti&s;ement to him and his People, by fil|ling up his own Admini&s;tration <HI>with Mercy and Judgment,</HI> as Occa&s;ions therefor &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> particularly to form a Scheme and Method of Behaviour and Management of per&s;onal and publick Conduct, in his Clo&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, Family, the Church, Court and Kingdom, to the end Piety and Vertue might revive, &amp; a general if not univer&s;al Reformation be happi|ly accompli&s;hed.

and zealous King to think of the divine Mer|cy and Judgment, and to form a Method of preparing him&s;elf, his Hou&s;e, Court &amp; King|dom, for the return of their God. And what other could he have judg'd God or Man did expect from him. On which, I need not &s;ay to this Audience, how applicable, the great Variety and Succe&s;&s;ion of merciful and afflic|tive Providences to this <HI>Province,</HI> have ren|dred the&s;e Words to our &s;elves at this Day. In general, on the <HI>Text,</HI> I would ob&s;erve the Character here given of the <HI>Candidates</HI> for Government and Council: For tho' it be in a &s;ingle Term, is very comprehen&s;ive, as the original Word, tran&s;lated <HI>faithful,</HI> imports. And indeed Fidelity and Truth, more &s;trictly taken, are very great Vertues; much more when con&s;idered as attended with all others. The&s;e were the <HI>Objects</HI> of the King's Eyes, which, tho' the <HI>Tran&s;lators</HI> have taken the li|berty to turn only <HI>forward,</HI> doubtle&s;s the Rea|&s;on of the thing leads to the <HI>pa&s;t</HI> and <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> as well as future time. For, without Que&s;tion, he had long &s;ince tho't on the matter; his pre&s;ent thought was upon it; and for the &s;ame Rea&s;on ever &s;hould be. And as he had frequent Opportunity to &s;ee his People, at their publick Solemnities, &amp; in his own Pro|gre&s;s and Circuit, he would &s;ingle out the be&s;t qualified, inve&s;ting them with proper Power and Authority.</P>

Agreeably whereto, at this time, we may do the&s;e following things.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. Unfold the <HI>Character</HI> here given, <HI>de&s;crip|tive</HI> of the proper Candidates for Election.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. Con&s;ider the proper Bu&s;ine&s;s and Office of the Electors, de&s;cribed <HI>by having their Eyes on the&s;e Faithful of the Land.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>III. Pre&s;ent &s;ome <HI>Arguments</HI> and <HI>Motives,</HI> to induce hereto, that they may prefer the Faithful alone. And finally,</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. Make &s;ome more particular <HI>Application</HI> on the whole.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>I. Let us open the <HI>general Character</HI> here given, of the Per&s;ons proper to be elected.</P>
<P>In general, <HI>They &s;hould be faithful and true Men;</HI> for they &s;tand oppos'd to the Vicious, and Ill-qualified, whom he Names with de&s;ign to reject and exclude them. 'Tis ob&s;erved, the Per&s;ons, whom he re&s;olves not to employ, are not the mo&s;t &s;candalous and gro&s;s Sinners; for the putting &s;uch into Authority was too bare-fac'd to be done in any Government, where Vertue and Order have any tolerable Influence: but Per&s;ons of a far le&s;s unde&s;irea|ble Character; who yet, by their real Wicked|ne&s;s, and &s;ecret De&s;igns and Practices, were
<PB N="10" REF="003417_0009_0FF839AC0617D850">
unfit for a publick Tru&s;t. Now the <HI>Faithful</HI> mu&s;t de&s;ign a Character the rever&s;e of both the&s;e: and that the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> &s;o meant, is very evident on the bear reading of the P&s;alm. They mu&s;t be Per&s;ons of real good Abilities, of apparent and vi&s;ible Vertue; not gro&s;sly Vicious, &s;uch as Drunkards, Adulterers, For|nicators, Murtherers, Bla&s;phemers, and pro|phane Swearers. For it would be an In&s;ult on God Almighty for &s;uch to repre&s;ent Him. They &s;hould be Per&s;ons of real and inward Vertue, as well as apparently fober, ju&s;t and good. To which we mu&s;t add, they were to be very much of King <HI>David'</HI>s Spirit, Ability and good Life; wearing his own Character. This appears from his De&s;ign in promoting them, which was, as he expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>to dwell with him:</HI> which very good Expo&s;itors inter|pret, <HI>to &s;it in his Council,</HI> advi&s;ing, and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ing in the Admini&s;tration; &s;o that the parti|culars he mentions of him&s;elf, as well as tho&s;e pertaining to &s;uch whom he renounces, as unfit for Office, are ju&s;tly to be con&s;idered in the De&s;cription. I &s;hall therefore, agreeably hereto, mention two Things which generally enter into it.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. They are de&s;cribed from the place of their Nativity, Education and Abode.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. By &s;ome &s;pecial moral Vertues, and po|litical Perfections nece&s;&s;arily requir'd.</ITEM>

<P N="1"><PB N="11" REF="003417_0010_0FF839AEA6C8AE30">
1. They are <HI>Natives</HI> and <HI>Inhabitants of the Land:</HI> Born, Educated, Principled and Settled in it; and &s;o have a Right by Birth, and com|mon Inheritance, to be Chief and Rulers a|mong the People, their Brethren; who can &s;ay truly and affectionately of them, <HI>they are Fle&s;h of our Fle&s;h, and Bone of our Bone.</HI> Their Fa|mily and Stock, Acquaintance, Bu&s;ine&s;s and E&s;tate, are in the Land; partaking of the &s;ame Rights and Priviledges; expo&s;ed to the com|mon Difficulties, Hazards and Expences of the Publick; &s;haring in it's Fortune; equally engaged, by Inclination and Intere&s;t, to &s;eek it's Pro&s;perity, and to ward off the fatal Blows which are threatned. The&s;e are the Men who love the Country as their Native Soil, as well as for its being a good and plea&s;ant Land, which the Lord their God hath given their Fathers and them&s;elves: and who, therefore, will concern them&s;elves for the publick good, as Members of the &s;ame Body, and in Tru&s;t for Po&s;terity in all &s;ucceeding Generations. Thus the ancient Law by which King <HI>David</HI> govern'd, forbid Strangers ruling over his People, which is but the agreed Sen&s;e of Man|kind. And therefore a Government by Stran|gers, was threatned as a Judgment to the <HI>I&s;ra|elites,</HI> and oft times hath proved fatal to many flouri&s;hing Countries: For which Rea&s;on, <HI>the Faithful in the Land,</HI> were the Per&s;ons whom this excellent Ruler accounted proper for pro|motion.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="003417_0011_0FF839B0B76F5860">
But 2. We are to con&s;ider &s;ome &s;pecial <HI>mo|ral Vertues</HI> and <HI>political Excellencies,</HI> which render Per&s;ons faithful, and are peculiarly eyed by this Royal Prophet.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Faithful are Per&s;ons of eminent Skill and Wi&s;dom: which good Qualities fir&s;t enter into the Character of a Coun&s;ellor. Such therefore &s;hould be remarkably di&s;tingui&s;hed in the Powers and Faculties of their Mind; the Compa&s;s and Extent of their Knowledge; the clearne&s;s and method of it; the turn and quickne&s;s of their Thought; it's Comprehen|&s;ion&punc; Penetration and Sagacity: For readine&s;s and ju&s;tne&s;s of Thought are great Perfections of the humane Mind, very needful for Rulers, particularly on Emergencies, and where the publick Affairs re&s;emble a <HI>Labyrinth.</HI> They &s;hould be Men under&s;tanding the Times, knowing what their People ought to do. Like <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Daniel,</HI> they &s;hould be Men of Su|perior and Incomparable Wi&s;dom, to di&s;cern Things which are ob&s;cure, unriddle what is doubtful, de&s;cry what is di&s;tant, clearly &s;eeing through the Artifices, Colours and Pretexts, which, as a Cloak, wrap up &s;ecret De&s;igns, &amp; cover de&s;igned publick Mi&s;chiefs. They &s;hou'd be very well acquainted with the frame of hu|mane Nature; with it's Capacities, Weakne&s;&s;es, Appetites, Pa&s;&s;ions, Humours, Di&s;advantages, Conveniences and Dependances. In &s;hort, with it's Vertues, Vices, Wants and Supplies.
<PB N="13" REF="003417_0012_0FF8108D28019B90">
They &s;hould know the Law of Nature and Nations; the pre&s;ent Policy and Power, In|tere&s;t and Cour&s;e of the World; e&s;pecially of tho&s;e on whom they border and depend, and with whom they Trade. They &s;hould have an exact Knowledge of the civil and religious Con&s;titution of their own Country, it's Ri&s;e and Planting, Changes, Intere&s;ts, and the like; peculiarly of the pre&s;ent Scituation, A&s;pect and tendency of Affairs; and of the Per&s;ons whom they &s;erve and advi&s;e, and with whom they are a&s;&s;ociated. To this purpo&s;e we may remember the Words of King <HI>Solomon</HI> the Preacher, <HI>Prov.</HI> 20. 5. <HI>Coun&s;el in the Heart of Man is like deep Water, but a Man of under|&s;tanding will draw it out.</HI> The&s;e things there|fore, &s;hould very plainly be opened, fully com|prehended, exactly compared and adju&s;ted, and, to this end, be clo&s;ely and often con&s;i|der'd; by which means, good De&s;igns may be laid, wi&s;e Schemes formed, &s;uitable Laws enacted, and an&s;werable Endeavours and Con|duct apply'd, for the happy I&s;&s;ue of Affairs: <HI>For Wi&s;dom is profitable to direct.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. They are Per&s;ons of inflexible Ju&s;tice &amp; Impartiality. Otherwi&s;e their Skill will de|generate into Craft and Cunning, which, in|&s;tead of being Serviceable, will be of pernici|ous Con&s;equence. For there is &s;omething due to every Man in the Community, which &s;hou'd be rendred to him in particular. Therefore
<PB N="14" REF="003417_0013_0FF839B3D101E990">
the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Ruler is to con&s;ider and ad|ju&s;t the proportion, &s;ea&s;on and manner, and then make a Di&s;tribution. This is the Appli|cation of Government to Per&s;ons and Ca&s;es; for which &s;ome have &s;pecial Powers and Ta|lents, which they &s;hould improve, by framing &s;uitable Laws and Orders for proportioning Rewards and Penalties; the advi&s;ing whereto is one e&s;pecial Office of the Coun&s;ellour. Thus Honour, Fear, Cu&s;tom and Tribute will be rendred to all, who re&s;pectively may claim them; but without this there can be no Truth or Fidelity, in the Admini&s;tration; for which Rea&s;on, a mo&s;t &s;trict regard ever &s;hould be had to it, and &s;uch Council given as hath an evident and &s;trong Tendency to di&s;tribute it; for we read, <HI>He that ruleth over Men mu&s;t be ju&s;t:</HI> not being bya&s;s'd by any thing but &s;trict Equity and Ju&s;tice: and therefore in all the Advice they give, and A&s;&s;i&s;tance they afford, they &s;hould aim wholly at what is &s;trictly ju&s;t: This we are taught by <HI>David</HI> in this <HI>P&s;alm, v.</HI> 3 <HI>I hate the Work of them who turn a&s;ide, it &s;hall not cleave to me.</HI> And before this, <HI>I will &s;et no wicked thing before mine Eyes.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. They are Per&s;ons of inviolable Truth &amp; Veracity. Not allowing a Thought, much le&s;s a Word, le&s;t of all any Action oppo&s;ite to the Truth. They will not injure the Name and Reputation of any, tho' it could be done ever &s;o &s;ecretly and clo&s;ely. Thus the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI>

They will therefore repre&s;ent Per&s;ons and Things, as they truly are, without any Artifice or Di&s;gui&s;e. They are &s;uch as have great regard to the publick Faith and En|gagements, tho' made to private and meaner Per&s;ons: not advi&s;ing or con&s;enting to the Violation thereof, without a ju&s;t Compen&s;ati|on for the Damages that may ari&s;e to the whole Body, or any of it's Members. They will not di&s;&s;emble and di&s;gui&s;e their Principles, Views and Compliances; but declare and act openly. They are not a&s;hamed, nor afraid, the publick &s;hould know, what them&s;elves are, de&s;ign, maintain, and will pro&s;ecute: for they will abide by their di&s;intere&s;ted Views. They are of &s;uch Truth and Fidelity, that they will not defraud the Government to whom they are engag'd, of their Time, Skill and Strength. Their Faith differs from the publick only in degree and extent; not in kind and quality. They do not fear the &s;tricte&s;t Enquiry into their Councils and Mea&s;ures, nor the mo&s;t publick In&s;pection and Examination. For as

the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> el&s;ewhere &s;ays, <HI>They &s;peak the Truth from their Heart, P&s;al.</HI> 15. 2. Their whole Action and Management is an exact Tran&s;cript of their Mind and Heart. They are not of a double Heart and Tongue. Nor do they conform their Temper, Di&s;cour&s;e, Principles and Conver&s;ation, to the change of Times and Company into which they fall; but pre&s;erve an Harmony in their intire Con|duct and Management, without acting the part of publick Hypocrites, who trim and &s;hift Sides and Parties, as they apprehend their Intere&s;t may be promoted by it. But this leads me to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="4">4. They are of a publick Spirit, which is but Ju&s;tice and Fidelity to the Government, and their own Office. They make not their private Intere&s;t their <HI>End,</HI> nor Self the <HI>Center,</HI> to which all things in the Circle and Compa&s;s of their Ability, Authority, Influence and Op|portunity, tend. They readily unclothe them|&s;elves of all private narrow Views, and put on a mo&s;t enlarged Spirit; not regarding their own Profit in preference, much le&s;s in oppo&s;i|tion to the common Intere&s;t, which engro&s;&s;eth their <HI>own.</HI> They di&s;dain &s;o mean a Thought as this, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> I have, by various Artifices, Flat|teries and Compliances, wrought my &s;elf into the Favour of tho&s;e who have promoted me to a publick Station, now therefore I will im|prove all my Skill, Strength and Opportunity

to encrea&s;e Honours on my &s;elf and Family, and to carve out an hand&s;ome and growing E&s;tate. They are &s;uch who&s;e per&s;onal Bene|fit will not be the Spring and Motive of their Projections and Pro&s;ecutions, much le&s;s will they cloak their &s;elfi&s;h De&s;igns with the pro|fe&s;&s;ion and &s;hew of publick Zeal, that they may not be expo&s;s'd to the Ob&s;ervation and Cen&s;ure of the World. They are &s;uch who will make their own Fortune a Noble Offer|ing to God and the common Wealth. And who, di&s;cerning a contracted Spirit in others, are &s;o far from kindling the Sparks of it in their own Bo&s;om, that they quench it. They are &s;uch who divinely de&s;ire the pro&s;perity of the Body Politick, never converting it's Strength to the Head, or any particular Members, however Honourable or le&s;s Comely, &s;o as to deprive the others of their ju&s;t mea&s;ure of In|fluence, Nouri&s;hment or Protection; but &s;ay with the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t, v.</HI> 3. <HI>I will &s;et no wicked thing before mine Eyes, I hate the Work of them that turn a&s;ide, it &s;hall not cleave to me.</HI> This will render them Benefactors, while they &s;eek not their own Wealth, but that of others.</P>
<P N="5">5. They are Per&s;ons of indefatigable Ap|plication and Indu&s;try. Who account their Office a Calling, in which, therefore, they mu&s;t employ not divert them&s;elves. Their Station mu&s;t be pre&s;erved and maintain'd, the proper Bu&s;ine&s;s of it being continually done,
<PB N="18" REF="003417_0017_0FF839BCA7F80288">

They mu&s;t proportion their Indu&s;try to its proper Occa&s;ions, and be early and con&s;tant, ready and chearful, whenever they are called, or Summon'd, to go and give the be&s;t Advice they can. Like King <HI>David, &s;erving their Generation by the Will of God,</HI> till they fall a|&s;leep, or are decayed by Age and Infirmities, or otherwi&s;e are providentially di&s;charged.

Such a proof, wi&s;e Men are apt to &s;eek. And this naturally and powerfully draws the Eyes of the Elector, and procures his Voice; which we may learn from the true Reading of the Text. But this leads me as naturally to the next general Head, which is,</P>

<P>III. To pre&s;ent &s;ome Arguments and Mo|tives to per&s;wade hereto, that they may pre|fer the Faithful alone. And in the fir&s;t place,</P>
<P N="1">1. Let it be con&s;ider'd how much the Ho|nour of Almighty God, the great Ruler of the World, is concerned herein. There is but one God the Father of all, and one Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, e&s;pecially to us Chri&s;tians. <HI>The King|dom is the Lords, and he is the Governour among the Nations.</HI> His Supremacy is undoubted; for by him Kings reign, and Princes decree Righteou&s;ne&s;s. Wi&s;dom and Coun&s;el are his; yea, &s;ound Knowledge and Under&s;tanding. Earthly Rulers are his Mini&s;ters, and for good to his People. As his Servants, they are qua|lified, commi&s;&s;ioned, cloathed, a&s;&s;i&s;ted, &s;uc|ceeded, and rewarded by him. His In&s;tructi|ons they mu&s;t regard &s;incerely, and obey them &s;trictly and &s;teadily. His Kingdom &amp; Glory &s;hould be their chief Concern; for of him, and thro' him are all things; to him therefore all the Glory and Prai&s;e ever &s;hould be a&s;cri|bed. His Name is put upon them, which they may not defile. Now who but the Faithful
<PB N="29" REF="003417_0028_0FF839D4C7F07880">
can, or will give him the Glory which is his due? If Rulers fight again&s;t GOD, prophane and bla&s;pheme his &s;acred Name, di&s;counte|nance Religion, and encourage Vice, they here|by reproach his Government, and di&s;honour his Name, which they wear as their civil Stile: and many will be apt to think God him&s;elf is altogether &s;uch as his Servants on Earth; &s;o that in their &s;ecret Thought, they will be tempted to charge him with Male-Ad|mini&s;tration, ina&s;much as his Providence per|mits &s;uch to be gods over his People. What higher Motive than this, of the divine Glory, which &s;hould be the chief de&s;ign of Man, can I po&s;&s;ibly pre&s;ent to you? or what Argument equal to it?</P>
<P N="2">2. Let it be con&s;idered, how much they &s;hould be moved hereto, on the account of Government it &s;elf: the due Admini&s;tration whereof cannot be expected on any other grounds than tho&s;e we have laid. For what can be well done without the&s;e good Qualities in Rulers? e&s;pecially this Care of tho&s;e, who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s it is to di&s;po&s;e of publick Offices? Without this there will be no due Circulation of the Blood, nor Transfu&s;ion of the Spirit, Life and Strength of the whole Body; but every thing will &s;tagnate, langui&s;h and morti|fy. If due Regard be had to this divine Re|&s;olution of King <HI>David,</HI> the Eyes in the Head will be cleared, the Hands &s;trengthen'd, every

Member will flouri&s;h and thrive in its due proportion; do its Office, maintain its Station, and perfect the Con&s;titution: the pre&s;ervati|on of which very much depends on a proper Admini&s;tration, and this on the Per&s;ons in|tru&s;ted with it; and that the&s;e be &s;uitable, depends on tho&s;e who elect and appoint them. For undue promotions in proce&s;s of Time, will bring great Weakne&s;s and Convul&s;ions, and it may be, i&s;&s;ue in a Di&s;&s;olution: to be &s;ure, the Benefits de&s;ign'd from Government will not be enjoy'd by them; upon which the People will be apt to de&s;pi&s;e it, trample on Authority, and think it an Artifice to &s;erve &s;ome dark De&s;igns, and particular Per&s;ons. Doubtle&s;s the Decays into which States and Kingdoms hath fallen, till at la&s;t total Ruine hath come upon them, are much to be attri|buted, to Supinene&s;s, Cunning or Wickedne&s;s, the Selfi&s;hne&s;s or tyranous Ambition, of tho&s;e who have had the publick Offices in their Hands, and led into the Councils and Mea|&s;ures which have been taken. This brings on a corruption and degeneracy of Principles and Manners, which provoke GOD Almighty to leave them to their own Councils, and take the Fate they have cho&s;en; giving them Chil|dren to Rule over them, or ranging Bears to devour them. A healthy Con&s;titution, by good Conduct, and prudent Care, may be pre&s;erved Athletick, and be ripen'd by the Fi|delity and Ability of the Officers under it&punc;
<PB N="31" REF="003417_0030_0FF839D96AA655C0">
But the decay thereof mu&s;t gradually en&s;ue, as there is a Neglect of filling up all Stations with the be&s;t Officers; or if there be &s;uch an intermixture of the feeble, fal&s;e, and wicked, as to give too many bad Examples, neither doing any good them&s;elves, nor a&s;&s;i&s;ting or con&s;enting others &s;hould do it. Hence a civil Con&s;titution, however perfect and adapted to a Country, is but u&s;ele&s;s, unle&s;s it be anima|ted and exerci&s;ed with the Life and Spirit of its Members, e&s;pecially of the Head, Heart and Hands: It is but a Notion, not the Sub|&s;tance of Government, in which the Fruits and Effects mu&s;t be an&s;werable to the De&s;ign of it. Wherefore the vi&s;ible Danger, and De&s;truction of the Form of a People's Government, ari&s;ing from their not preferring the Faithful, and ta|king proper pains to ob&s;erve and promote them, is a &s;trong and affecting, becau&s;e a very near Motive.</P>
<P N="3">3. The reformation of a People's Manners &s;hould be a quickning Con&s;ideration hereto. Reformation ever was, and will be a nece&s;&s;ary Work: for in the Land of Uprightne&s;s many will deal perver&s;ely. Sin, and Immorality u|&s;ually are too flouri&s;hing, oftimes bold and rampant. Hence the Temper, De&s;ign and Admini&s;tration of earthly Rulers &s;hould an|&s;wer their Title, <HI>for they are gods:</HI> and in Imi|tation of God the great King, they &s;hould be a Terror to Evil-doers, prai&s;ing and promo|ting
<PB N="32" REF="003417_0031_0FF839DB839B6A88">
&s;uch as do well. They &s;hould acquaint their People with their publick and prevailing Di&s;orders, warning and charging again&s;t them. They &s;hould do Execution on bold Tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ours, and as the Royal <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> re&s;olves, <HI>cut off and de&s;troy them.</HI> They &s;hould al&s;o di&s;tri|bute and impart their Powers and Vertues, among their People: e&s;pecially by Example, which will greatly influence to a happy Re|formation: for Vertue or Vice will very much ebb or flow, as it is in the Fountain of Go|vernment: The&s;e in their People will very much be accounted to their Leaders. And therefore if all who are in Government be not faithful, how will an effectual Stand be made again&s;t Di&s;order and Wickedne&s;s? For can it be thought a vicious Ruler can have Zeal, or &s;o much as the Face, to puni&s;h Vice in ge|neral, or his own particular Vice coppied by others, and this publickly? Who can have &s;uch little Conduct, while they know the Vice and Sentence upon it, will in&s;tantly be retor|&s;ed, and rebound on the guilty Judge? Po&s;&s;i|bly no Age of the Chri&s;tian World, &s;ince the Reformation, more needed the revival of that Work than the pre&s;ent, nor any Day, of any particular Age, more than this. Wherefore, the mo&s;t faithful Per&s;ons &s;hould have the Power and Authority to effect it, put into their Hands; and &s;uch alone, that one publick Officer may not wink at the Crimes which another puni&s;heth, nor openly violate the Laws
<PB N="33" REF="003417_0032_0FF839DD0F815470">
which all &s;hould &s;upport. For we know that <HI>one Sinner will de&s;troy much good.</HI> Therefore the greate&s;t Gravity, Sobriety, Self-denial, Circum&s;pection and Zeal, become all tho&s;e who are Guardians of the Vertue of a People, de&s;igning to lead them back to the Life of God. But this leads in the la&s;t place,</P>
<P N="4">4. To ob&s;erve the revival and flouri&s;hing of Religion requireth this. For if the Wicked are exalted the Righteous mourn, and well may they do &s;o; but if the Righteous are promoted there is rejoycing; for then may they <HI>live quiet and peaceable Lives in all Godline&s;s and Hone&s;ty.</HI> And then be&s;ides, the Enacting good Laws, and their due Executi|on, are herein greatly concerned; therefore the promotion of faithful Men is of the fir&s;t Con&s;ideration, and greate&s;t Moment. For Religion is the Life of a People, the Perfecti|on of humane Nature, and therefore its <HI>true&s;t Life.</HI> If this be di&s;couraged, neglected, con|temned and &s;tarved, gradually all will decay.

The Mini&s;ters of Religion do very much to better the <HI>Morals</HI> of a Peo|ple; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> they teach &amp; enjoyn Vertue in a very taking manner, and declaim with equal force again&s;t all Vice.

them, for the&s;e Officers are in their Na|ture very different. There is no publick Con&s;cience, nor infallible humane Guide in the Church, much le&s;s in the State: for Je&s;us Chri&s;t alone is Lord of Con&s;cience, and by his infallible Spirit of Truth, leads his Di&s;ci|ples into all Truth, teaching them all things: Yet the civil Ruler &s;hould be careful that his People be humane and moral, practice the Re|ligion of Nature, ob&s;erve the Decalogue, and protect and incourage the Chri&s;tian in his Faith, Wor&s;hip and Di&s;cipline; provided he maintain, no Principle, propagate no Opini|on, nor go into any Practice, &s;ubver&s;ive of the rights of Mankind, the publick Peace and Pro&s;perity: but the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of Prophane|ne&s;s, Licentiou&s;ne&s;s, Intemperance, Unclean|ne&s;s, Pride, Prodigality, Covetou&s;ne&s;s, Mur|ther, Cur&s;ing, Swearing, and the like, evident|ly is his Province, and greatly tends to the flouri&s;hing of Religion.

Defference, to remind you of &s;ome near Con|&s;iderations which may unite with the Current of your publick Thoughts this Day. The <HI>Royal Charter</HI> and <HI>Tru&s;t,</HI> with the good <HI>Laws</HI> of the Land, &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, very much re|quire, and urge your following the good Re|&s;olution which this <HI>Text</HI> exhibits. So doth the Royal <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion,</HI> Example and Expecta|tion; to which we cannot but add the ear|ne&s;t De&s;ire, &amp; great Expectation of this good and loyal People. For what Province, &s;ub|ject to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Crown, more values the Royal Family and Succe&s;&s;ion, or more con|&s;tantly and heartily prays for the King? to which our wi&s;e and good Governours have not failed to bear their honourable and faith|ful Te&s;timony. This good People, I &s;ay, have their Eyes upon their Rulers, e&s;pecially on Tho&s;e, whom they have cho&s;en to repre|&s;ent them, on this great Occa&s;ion, to act their Power, that they faithfully perform this weighty Tru&s;t.

They have a pro|portionable intere&s;t in framing Laws, pa&s;&s;ing Acts and Orders, and their Concern is great

mention whereof is &s;ufficient for me. Unto all which I would add, We may well remind our&s;elves of the original Purcha&s;ers, Planters and Magi&s;trates of this Country, who made this Rule of King <HI>David'</HI>s their own; there|in giving the be&s;t Example to all their Po&s;te|rity. For by this means they laid the Foun|dation of that Growth and Perfection unto which, at pre&s;ent, we are arrived. And if &s;o, we can't think any other, but that our full Maturity mu&s;t ari&s;e from the &s;ame e&s;&s;ential Principles, which hitherto have pre&s;erv'd and ripen'd us.</P>
<P>If I do not mi&s;take, we are <HI>now,</HI> in the Af|fairs of this <HI>Day,</HI> entring on the <HI>&s;econd Century</HI> of chu&s;ing our Magi&s;trates, within this Terri|tory of the ancient <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts.</HI> And there|fore, on this Occa&s;ion, to call to mind our Fathers <HI>publick Spirit,</HI> and the good Succe&s;s of it, is a proper Reverence for their Per&s;ons, Principles and Proceedings: and the ju&s;t Im|provement we are to make of it, is our &s;trict Imitation of them. This is due to their Pa|tent, Purcha&s;e, Piety and Prayers, and the a|lone fit Di&s;charge of that Tru&s;t thereby com|mitted to each &s;ucceeding Generation. What we have, we &s;hould account the purcha&s;e of their Money, yea, of their very Lives; Wa|ter'd with their Tears; Sanctified by their extraordinary Vertue, Example and Prayers to God; tran&s;mitted by their &s;olemn Charge

to their Children; inrich'd &amp; &s;ealed with their Toil and Blood, which was &s;hed by the in|ho&s;pitable and mercile&s;s <HI>Heathen:</HI> wherefore we &s;hould be as careful and tender of our+&s;elves and Succe&s;&s;ors, as they were.</P>
<P>But to be more particular,</P>
<P>Your EXCELLENCY hath drawn the Eyes of this People upon you, in your many Declarations and Re&s;olutions, mo&s;t publickly made, on behalf of Vertue and Religion. You very well know the great and growing dege|neracy of this Land, and will therefore per|mit us to expect a happy Reformation in the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of all Vice, and encouragement of Vertue and good Men.</P>
<P>And as we thank God for the good Exam|ple, you long &s;ince gave, in your Per&s;on and Family, and in our Churches, of which, you are &s;o happy, as to be a very Honourable Member, by Birth, Bapti&s;m and Choice; &s;o we hope it will have a great and becoming Influence on all about you, and whom you employ: e&s;pecially while you are careful to continue and brighten your good Example, it may, more particularly, have an happy In|fluence on our Families, and on tho&s;e of prin|cipal Figure, to provoke and prevail with them to Con&s;ecrate them&s;elves to the Lord, and their Hou&s;es to be <HI>Bethels:</HI> an emulation

of you, in which, we tru&s;t, will very much plea&s;e you, as we are &s;ure, it will greatly Honour you. And then be&s;ides, as Your EXCELLENCY, is advanced to the chief Seat of Honour and Dignity among your Brethren, and have either <HI>alone,</HI> or in Con|junction with your <HI>Honourable Council,</HI> a Power, to di&s;po&s;e of many Offices, of very great Con&s;equence to this People; &s;uch as <HI>Civil</HI> and <HI>Military</HI> Po&s;ts; we tru&s;t you will never impower or employ any in the&s;e Offi|ces, who evidently fight again&s;t God and Re|ligion, or are &s;lack in their own Principles and Lives: but will ever remember and main|tain the Re&s;olution of King <HI>David,</HI> in the latter part of the Ver&s;e, where our <HI>Text</HI> lies, and which exactly &s;uits to my purpo&s;e, <HI>He that walketh in a perfect way, he &s;hall &s;erve me,</HI> that is to &s;ay, in &s;ome Station and Ser|vice of Honour, which the original Word de&s;igns.</P>
<P>And now, as for the <HI>Honourable Per&s;ons</HI> who may this Day be elected: The De|&s;cription, which has already been given, &s;uf|ficently &s;hews, what our Expectation from them mu&s;t be, namely, That they faithfully di&s;charge all the Duties of their Office; e&s;pe|cially, con&s;idering of how va&s;t Importance it is, of which we have heard before, and by how much more critical the Times, and Affairs of the <HI>Province</HI> are, or may be.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="003417_0043_0FF839F520F220B8">
In a word, There is very great need of Wi&s;dom, Zeal, Steadine&s;s and Courage, in the whole Government at this Day; con&s;ide|ring the great Decays, into which Religion, I do not mean, that of a Party, (for true Re|ligion di&s;dains &s;uch limits, the Name and Thing) but <HI>Vital</HI> and <HI>Catholick</HI> Religion; the deep Decays into which that is fallen and falling.</P>
<P>And here &s;uffer me, with a becoming Hu|mility, to put you in mind, That the <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> of our Churches need much Countenance; it may be more &s;till, and more effectual mea|&s;ures, for their Support, that &s;uch Pari&s;hes, which, to &s;ay the be&s;t of them, have neg|lected the In&s;truction and Re&s;olve i&s;&s;ued by this Court, a few Years &s;ince, may find the <HI>Legi&s;lature</HI> was as &s;incere and fixed <HI>fully</HI> to perform and effect that ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary De&s;ign and Work, if that more mild and gen|tle Method did not take the de&s;ired Effect. Again, it is evident, that Numbers among us will carry off the <HI>Exci&s;e</HI> laid on a &s;ingle Gallon of Strong Liquor with one Draught: the Conclu&s;ion therefore is open, That if <HI>In|temperance</HI> mu&s;t be reformed, (and all agree that it is nece&s;&s;ary) it &s;hould be clog'd with Penalties and Difficulties which equal or ex|ceed the &s;trength of the vicious Appetite: and that the <HI>Exce&s;s</HI> &s;hould &s;trictly be
<PB N="45" REF="003417_0044_0FF839F9495C2DE0">
ob&s;erved, and puni&s;h'd by all proper Officers. Once more, Pride, with other ri&s;ing fa&s;hiona|ble Lu&s;ts, Swearing, Cur&s;ing, Sabbath-break|ing, Idlene&s;s, La&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s, Covetou&s;ne&s;s and Prodigality, &s;hould be treated with great Severity; but e&s;pecially I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, on behalf of God Almighty, that, while we &s;et a very great Value on our own Name, and wou'd recover va&s;t Damages for the Injuries done to it, we ought not, in <HI>common Decency,</HI> to &s;et <HI>His</HI> at a lower rate, permitting the vi|le&s;t Breath to &s;ully it, almo&s;t unpuni&s;h'd. And now this would carry on the Addre&s;s to all the civil Officers of the Land, that they be faithful; otherwi&s;e our good Laws will fail of Execution, and certainly &s;ap the Foun|dations of Vertue, Religion, and the Govern|ment. Nor will it be le&s;s fatal if any Per&s;ons are promoted to Office, meerly for the &s;ake of their Family, Relations, Acquaintance, Education and E&s;tate, or indeed for any other Rea&s;on, be&s;ide their Fidelity.</P>
<P>I might, in the next place, &s;peak to all the People in the Land, could I reach them; but this being practicable only by the Ho|nourable their <HI>Rulers,</HI> and e&s;pecially their <HI>Re|pre&s;entatives,</HI> I would only &s;ay, It is hoped your Honours will ever Influence your Prin|cipals to elect &s;uch as have been de&s;cribed, into the &s;everal Offices proper to the Affairs of your Towns, Di&s;tricts and Courts: and

For the neglect of making a due Choice in our &s;eve|ral Societies, gradually will bring on great Corruption, and in the end it may be, Confu&s;ion and a Di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>And now before I conclude, there is an Application of this Subject, &s;o naturally ari|&s;ing from all I have &s;aid, to the <HI>Youth</HI> of the Land, and of &s;uch Importance, that I may by no means be allowed to omit it. For nothing can be more &s;uitable, than, on this Occa&s;ion, to put you in mind of your excellent Parents and Progenitors; that, like them, you may be faithful to God, to Religion, to your Country and Families: but mine Eyes par|ticularly are upon &s;uch, who&s;e temporal Cir|cum&s;tances, De&s;cent and Education, open a pro&s;pect of their being called to publick Ser|vice. It would therefore be very happy in|deed, if the young People among us, e&s;peci|ally the Gentry, would &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider this matter, and endeavour every way to conform them&s;elves, to the Temper and Life here de|&s;cribed: not pre&s;uming to expect any Coun|tenance or Promotion without it; but with it you may &s;tand fairly among the Candidates for Authority. Wherefore, be ambitious of &s;erving God in your Generation, and being be&s;t qualified for it. This will render your

Per&s;ons honourable and lovely, your Ad|vancement univer&s;ally acceptable, and your Admini&s;tration, ju&s;t and ea&s;y. But more e&s;pe|cially &s;hould Tho&s;e regard this Advice, who&s;e Predece&s;&s;ors or Ance&s;tors have been thus pub|lickly honoured, that you may ri&s;e up in your Fathers &s;tead, and, if it may be, with &s;u|perior Accompli&s;hments. So the Eyes of the People &s;hall feed upon you. And as a pre|vailing Motive hereto, con&s;ider Degeneracy and Corruption in the Youth procures and portends nothing but Di&s;grace to their Fami|lies and the Land. For if the Vicious and Un-qualified &s;hould de&s;ire, and have the Face to ask, or &s;eek, and be permitted to &s;u&s;tain publick Offices, it would &s;ecretly &s;pread, and anon become common: from all which the utter Di&s;&s;olution of Manners mu&s;t en&s;ue. Therefore it is highly incumbent on their Parents, Guardians and In&s;tructors, very watchfully to ob&s;erve them, that they may di&s;cover their Principles, Spirit, Appetites, De&s;igns, Diver&s;ions and Company; forming them for future Service, unto which the Ho|nour, Vertue, Safety and Pro&s;perity, of their Hou&s;es, as well as the publick Weal, are na|tural and powerful Inducements. Let the Royal <HI>Preacher'</HI>s Exhortation to the Youth, with all <HI>his</HI> and <HI>its</HI> attending Circum&s;tances, be Ingraven on the Hearts of your Children, and be very legible in their Univer&s;al Life.</P>
