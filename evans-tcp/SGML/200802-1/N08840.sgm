<Q>FOR promotion cometh neither from the ea&s;t, nor from the we&s;t, nor from the &s;outh: But God is the Judge; He putteth down one, and &s;etteth up another.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_BY the light of rea&s;on and nature, we are led to believe in, and adore God, not only as the maker, but al&s;o as the governor of all things. In the &s;ame way we may be &s;atisfied that
<PB N="6" REF="011289_0005_0F869E2923D93348">
it is agreeable to the divine will, that civil government be e&s;tabli&s;hed among men, on principles equitable in them|&s;elves, and conducive to the common good. But in the&s;e points, revelation comes in to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of rea&s;on, and &s;hews them to us in a clearer light than we could &s;ee them without it's aid. This is done by many pa&s;&s;ages of &s;acred &s;crip|ture, and by that which I have now read in particular; which, without a critical examination of it's connexion, or any labored comment on it, may lead us to con&s;ider &mdash; God's approbation of civil government &mdash; His agency in putting men into, and removing them from places of power&mdash;what views per&s;ons &s;hould have in &s;eeking and accepting a part in go|vernment&mdash;what rules &s;hould be ob&s;erv|ed in introducing men into office&mdash;how tho&s;e that are promoted &s;hould be|have towards the people&mdash;and how the people &s;hould behave towards them. The two former of the&s;e heads of di&s;|cour&s;e lie plainly in the words of my text; the others are natural inferences from them.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="011289_0006_0F869E29B9C7ABF8">THE FIRST thing to be con&s;idered is God's approbation of civil government among mankind. This might be argu|ed from the di&s;po&s;itions and capacities which he hath implanted in human na|ture. By the&s;e men are adapted to &s;oci|ety, and inclined to a&s;&s;ociate together; and by a&s;&s;ociating, the happine&s;s of each individual may be greatly improved.</P>
<P>By forming into civil &s;ociety, men do indeed give up &s;ome of their natural rights; but it is in pro&s;pect of a rich com|pen&s;ation, in the better &s;ecurity of the re&s;t, and in the enjoyment of &s;everal ad|ditional ones, that flow from the con&s;ti|tution of government, which they e&s;ta|bli&s;h. Individuals agreeing in certain methods, in which their united force and &s;trength &s;hall be employed for mutu|al defence and &s;ecurity, is a general idea of civil government. The&s;e methods of defence being lawful and right in them|&s;elves, mu&s;t be agreeable to the will of God "who loveth righteou&s;ne&s;s:" They mu&s;t plea&s;e him who is "a God of order and not of con&s;u&s;ion;" as they tend to prevent "confu&s;ion and every evil work,"
<PB N="8" REF="011289_0007_0F869E2D70D7EBE8">
which otherwi&s;e would prevail, without re&s;traint, among &s;uch imperfect creatures as we are.</P>
<P>THE &s;tate of things in our world is evidently &s;uch, as to render civil go|vernment nece&s;&s;ary: But for this, life, li|berty, and property would be expo&s;ed to fatal inva&s;ion. The lu&s;ts of men, from whence come wars and fightings, would not be under &s;ufficient re&s;traint. Their conduct would be like that complained of in I&s;rael, when they had no king: "Every one did that which was right in his own eves.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Judges xvii.6.</NOTE>" Men would re&s;emble the fi&s;hes in the &s;ea, the greater devour|ing the le&s;s. This &s;tate of things as fully determines the will of God, who delights in the happine&s;s of his creatures, in favor of civil government, as it could have been done by an expre&s;s revelation. The voice of rea&s;on, in this ca&s;e, is the voice of God.</P>
<P>BUT the will of God, as to this thing, is not only deduceable from the&s;e rea&s;on|ings: His word of revelation declares it. "The powers that be are," expre&s;|&s;ly
<PB N="9" REF="011289_0008_0F869E2D7B36D810">
&s;aid to be, "ordained of God." Civil rulers are called "the mini&s;ters of God." And "he that re&s;i&s;teth them" is &s;aid to "re&s;i&s;t the ordinance of God."<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Rom xiii.1, 2, 4.</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT though God's approbation of civil government is &s;o evident; yet he hath not &s;een fit to point out any particu|lar form of it, in which all men are obliged to unite. This is left as a matter of free choice and agreement. Men have a natural right to determine for them&s;elves, in what way, and by whom they will be governed. The notion of a divine indefea&s;ible right to govern, ve&s;ted in particular per&s;ons, or families, is wholly without foundation; and is, I think, as generally exploded at this day, by men of &s;ober minds, as that of uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in eccle&s;ia&s;tical office, from the apo&s;tles of Chri&s;t, in order to the validity of chri&s;tian admi|ni&s;trations.</P>
<P><Q>THE mo&s;t impartial di&s;qui&s;itions of this matter, faith an anonymous writer, founded on the common &s;en&s;e and practice of mankind, have long ago
<PB N="10" REF="011289_0009_0F869E2E52E9ACC0">
convinced the wi&s;e and unprejudiced, that no individual, however nobly born, has a right over the per&s;on or property of another, except only from mutual compact, entred into for gene|ral benefit; the conditions of which, are as obligatory on the governing, as on the governed parties. No man, in the nature of things, is any way &s;uperior or inferior to his fellow citi|zens, but on &s;uch conditions, as they are &s;uppo&s;ed to have mutually con&s;en|ted to. It is only to prevent the con|fu&s;ion which riches, intere&s;t, or ambi|tion might create, among per&s;ons equally qualified, that the &s;overeignty hath been &s;ettled in particular families. It is in regard only to conveniency, that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;hould remain unin|terrupted, as long as it can be con&s;i&s;tent with the good of the whole. But where this is infringed, di&s;pen&s;ed with, &s;uper&s;eded, the obligation is cancelled. The people are free, and may either choo&s;e a new form of government, or put their old, into other hands.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="011289_0010_0F869E2EFACA3778">ALL nations have not cho&s;en the &s;ame form of government: Nor can we deter|mine that any one would be be&s;t for all. The different genius, temper and &s;ituation of nations and countries, may make different con&s;titutions of civil policy eligible, as different temperaments in human bodies, and the different climates in which they are placed, require different methods of regimen.</P>
<P>THE Theocracy of the Jews doth not di&s;prove this natural liberty of choice. That was no doubt a &s;ignal favor to that people, while it continued; and it was ungrateful in them to be &s;o &s;oon weary of it. Other nations were left to their liberty, to chu&s;e &s;uch a form of govern|ment, as they might think would be&s;t an&s;wer the end of all government, the public welfare; whether that of Monar|chy, Ari&s;tocracy, or Democracy; or a mixture of the&s;e. It is a mixture of the&s;e that our nation hath fixed upon: And this we are ready to think the happie&s;t that can be. We may po&s;&s;ibly be pre|judiced in favor of it, becau&s;e it is our own. Indeed we have le&s;s rea&s;on to
<PB N="12" REF="011289_0011_0F869E302A4AEB68">
think we are, &s;ince we have &s;o many te&s;timonies of &s;trangers to it's excellency. Be&s;ides the&s;e te&s;timonies, we have had &s;uch proofs of it's goodne&s;s, as are mo&s;t convictive, tho&s;e of experience. By it "we have enjoyed great quietne&s;s, and important favors have been done to our nation."</P>
<P>IN this form of government, <HI>power</HI> and <HI>privilege</HI> are happily united. They are wrought into it's foundation, &s;o that they cannot be &s;eperated, but by pulling down the pillars of it. Magi&s;trates can|not exerci&s;e their power, without main|taining the rights and privileges of the people: And people cannot enjoy their rights and privileges, without a&s;&s;erting and &s;upporting the power of magi&s;trates. We have rea&s;on to be thankful to the great Founder of civil government, that under his influence, our nation hath agreed in this con&s;titution, which hath already contributed &s;o much to it's hap|pine&s;s; and the important ble&s;&s;ings of which, we hope, will flow down to the late&s;t po&s;terity.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="011289_0012_0F869E307A1A8EB8">INDEED the be&s;t form of government will not render a people &s;afe and happy, without a good admini&s;tration. More depends on places of public tru&s;t being properly filled, than barely on the con|&s;titution. A people may perhaps, for a &s;ea&s;on, be tolerably happy, under the mo&s;t exceptionable form of government; but can &s;carcely be &s;o, under the be&s;t, when admini&s;tation is gro&s;ly corrupt. Their rights and privileges are very near|ly affected, by the character and con|duct of their rulers. The advancement of per&s;ons to places in government, is there|fore a mo&s;t intere&s;ting affair. It requires the &s;erious attention of all, who have a hand in it: And it will lead every man of religion, to implore the favor and influence of the &s;upreme ruler, <HI>who put|teth down one, and &s;etteth up another.</HI></P>
<P>This leads me,</P>
<P>SECONDLY. To con&s;ider the agency of God, in putting men into, and remov|ing them from places in government.</P>
<P>PROMOTION, faith the penman of my text, <HI>cometh neither from the ea&s;t,
<PB N="14" REF="011289_0013_0F869E314AA8B6C8">
nor from the we&s;t, nor from the &s;outh.</HI> We cannot (as one remarks on the words) "gain it, either by the wi&s;dom of the men of the <HI>ea&s;t</HI> or by the numerous forces of the <HI>we&s;tern</HI> i&s;les; or from tho&s;e of <HI>Egypt</HI> or <HI>Arabia,</HI> which lie <HI>&s;outhward</HI> of <HI>Judea.</HI> The rea&s;on why the <HI>north</HI> is not mention|ed may be becau&s;e the &s;ame word which is rendered <HI>north</HI> &s;ignifies God's <HI>&s;ecret|place</HI> or coun&s;el, from whence promotion doth come." Perhaps no more is inten|ded by this poetical expre&s;&s;ion, than that the mo&s;t favorable concurrence of &s;econd cau&s;es, will not prevail to advance per|&s;ons in government, without the influ|ence of the fir&s;t. A truth which none can di&s;believe, who admit God's &s;uper|intendency over all human affairs. A truth, in the faith of which, our own ob&s;ervation may have been &s;ufficient to confirm us. Have we not known &s;ome, ready to compa&s;s &s;ea and land, and to go from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and from north to &s;outh, in pur&s;uit of honor? And yet have they not found it like a &s;hadow, in this re&s;pect, as well as in &s;ome other, that it hath fled before them with a motion as &s;wift as that with which they have fol|lowed
<PB N="15" REF="011289_0014_0F869E32463EE080">
it? While they have tried every promi&s;ing method to climb the &s;lippery hill of honor, all their attempts have been bla&s;ted, and bla&s;ted in &s;uch &s;ecret and unexpected ways, as could not be ac|counted for, but by the agency of him "who di&s;appointeth the devices of the crafty, &s;o that their hands cannot per|form their enterprise."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job V.12.</NOTE></P>
<P>PROMOTION being denied to the power of &s;econd cau&s;es, is attributed to that of the fir&s;t. <HI>God is the judge: He putteth down one, and &s;etteth up another.</HI></P>
<P>GOD <HI>is the judge</HI>&mdash;When &s;everal par|ties contend for the prize of preferment, he determineth it to which he plea&s;eth, &s;o as be&s;t to &s;erve his own purpo&s;es. It is not only &s;afe but happy for the world, that ab&s;olute and uncontroulable power &s;hould be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a being of infinite wi&s;dom, invariable ju&s;tice and boundle&s;s mercy. Such power is often a&s;cribed to God, in the in&s;pired writings. <Q>Wis|dom and might are his: He removeth kings, and &s;etteth up kings: He hath put down the mighty from their &s;eats,
<PB N="16" REF="011289_0015_0F869E32E8A9A330">
and exalted them of low degree. The mo&s;t high ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whom&s;oever he will.</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dan. II.21, Luke I, 52. Dan. IV.</NOTE></P>
<P>GOD <HI>is the judge</HI> of men's qualifications for government, and his "judgment is al|ways according to truth." He knows whom to promote and whom to depo&s;e, in order to an&s;wer the wi&s;e plan of his univer&s;al providence. This power God doth not u&s;ually exerci&s;e in an immediate way, but by the intervention of &s;everal &s;econd cau&s;es; and the&s;e are united and combined together in &s;uch a manner, as could be done by no under&s;tanding but one that is infinite. Sacred, and other hi&s;tories furni&s;h us with in&s;tances hereof. The advancement of Jo&s;eph to great dignity and power in the Egyptian court, is a remarkable one. A variety of un|connected cau&s;es operated to bring this about, unconnected in them&s;elves, but united by him, "who&s;e kingdom ruleth over all." It was by the agency of God, that king Saul was di&s;graced, and David advanced; an event, to which it is pro|bable, our text has &s;pecial reference. By

<HI>this</HI> it came to pa&s;s, that proud Haman was hanged on the gallows he had made, of fifty cubits high; while Mordecai the Jew, for whom he had prepared the &s;ame, was promoted: By <HI>this,</HI> that haughty Nebuchadnezzar was turned a grazing a|mong the bea&s;ts, to teach him that "the heavens do rule:" By <HI>this,</HI> that boa&s;ting Herod was eaten of worms, becau&s;e he did not con&s;ider that he was one him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THE influence of the &s;upreme gover|nor of the world, in bringing about &s;uch events, in later ages, is not le&s;s real, though perhaps le&s;s evident and imme|diate. It mu&s;t be acknowledged in put|ting down &s;ome, and &s;etting up others, in our own nation and land. The fall of that unhappy and mi&s;guided king, <HI>Charles</HI> the fir&s;t, was an in&s;tance of it. So was that ever memorable event, &s;o happy in it's con&s;equences to GREAT|BRITAIN, and to the&s;e COLONIES, cal|led the REVOLUTION, when king <HI>James</HI> the &s;econd abdicated the throne, and KING WILLIAM and QUEEN MARY, of glorious memory, were advanced to it; which made way for the pre&s;ent hap|py

e&s;tabli&s;hment in the hou&s;e of HANO|VER. The people of this province, not only &s;hared in common with their fellow &s;ubjects, on the other &s;ide of the Atlantic, in the advantages ari&s;ing from this great change in government, but were parti|cularly happy, in being delivered from the oppre&s;&s;ive and tyrannical admini&s;tra|tion of <HI>Sir Edmund Andros.</HI> The agen|cy of heaven in the&s;e events, doth not determine the innocence or guilt of tho&s;e, who were the voluntary in&s;truments of bringing them about. "Thou coulde&s;t have no power at all again&s;t me," &s;aid our Saviour to Pilate, "except it were given thee from above:"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John XIX.11.</NOTE> Yet this did not prove him innocent, in "condemn|ing that ju&s;t one."</P>
<P>THE promotion of men to places of power and tru&s;t, who either have no talents for government, or are di&s;po&s;ed to u&s;e tho&s;e that they have, to wicked purpo&s;es, is an event, which may &s;eem hard to be accounted for. "God's judg|ments are a great deep." This however mu&s;t be a &s;ettled principle with us, "that the Judge of all the earth doth right."
<PB N="19" REF="011289_0018_0F869E354250AAA8">
His providence is by no means to be im|peached. The moral evils which take place, in con&s;equence of &s;uch promoti|ons, are not to be charged on him. He may permit &s;uch things, to puni&s;h a bad temper, either in the per&s;ons promoted, or in the people over whom they are &s;et, or in both. We &s;hould con&s;ider it as the primary de&s;ign of &s;uch puni&s;hment reform them; but if they remain incor|rigible under it, a fuller di&s;play of God's rectoral ju&s;tice and hatred of &s;in, will be made in their ruin. "The &s;cripture &s;aith unto Pharaoh, even for this &s;ame purpo&s;e have I rai&s;ed thee up, that I might &s;hew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom.

<P><PB N="20" REF="011289_0019_0F869E35B9AE5798">GOOD men, who have excellent ta|lents for government, and a di&s;po&s;ition to u&s;e them for the public advantage, are &s;ometimes kept out of place, or &s;uddenly &s;tripped of that civil power with which they had been cloathed. This is a chap|ter in the book of providence hard to be explained. In this way, we have rea&s;on to think, God &s;ometimes de&s;igns to pu|ni&s;h a people's ingratitude to him for a good admini&s;tration, which they have enjoyed; their un&s;ubmi&s;&s;ivene&s;s to it, and abu&s;e of it's ble&s;&s;ings. He may al&s;o in|tend the advantage of the per&s;ons thus di&s;|placed, by a di&s;pen&s;ation generally grie|vous enough to them. He may behold their virtue endangered by their elevati|on: He may fore&s;ee that they would not be proof again&s;t the temptations of it; and that they would neglect, what to them, as well as to others, is "the one thing needful," the care of their &s;ouls.

I here men|tion <HI>&s;eeking places,</HI> for I do not imagine that all kinds and degrees of this, are to be condemned; though the character of <HI>&s;eekers,</HI> in general, is a very odious and invidious one. Importunity in a can|didate for promotion is a pre&s;umptive evidence, that he is unfit for it. Men of the be&s;t qualifications have generally di&s;dained tho&s;e low arts and intrigues, by which &s;ome have made their way into places of power. It is hard to &s;ay what can be more ba&s;e and wicked, than the conduct of tho&s;e, who attempt to ri&s;e by the help of adulation and bribes, unle&s;s it be that of tho&s;e who hearken to them, and become the tools of their pride and ambition. That temper, however, de|&s;erves to be denominated a fal&s;e mode&s;ty, which makes men always decline pre&s;er|ment, when it comes in their way; or avoid tho&s;e offices which require great abilities, when they know them&s;elves to be po&s;&s;e&s;t of them.

If this is not the ca&s;e, they are in effect fighting again&s;t God. They ought not to &s;eek, nor even to accept, &s;uch offices as they know they cannot di&s;charge, in a good mea&s;ure an&s;werable to the nature and importance of them.</P>
<P>GOD <HI>is the judge</HI>&mdash;You &s;hould be able to look up to him in confidence, that he approves every &s;tep you take in the way to po&s;ts of honor; and with a willing|ne&s;s to be di&s;appointed, if in his unerring wi&s;dom he &s;ees you to be unfit for them; and that your &s;ucce&s;s would ope|rate either to the damage of the public, or of your&s;elves.

<P>The rules to be ob&s;erved by &s;uch is the</P>
<P>FOURTH thing to be con&s;idered. They &s;hould act with great fidelity and caution.

of per&s;onal advantage. The public pro&s;perity greatly depends on your faith|ful di&s;charge of your duty in this re&s;pect. You are accountable to God for the manner in which you di&s;charge it.

<P>WHAT the&s;e qualifications are, I have not time particularly to con&s;ider. Two of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential, and in which mo&s;t others may be included, I &s;hall briefly mention&mdash;<HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>Religion.</HI></P>
<P>No &s;mall degree of wi&s;dom and know|ledge is nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute a good ruler, whether he fills a place in the legi&s;|lative, or executive part of government. Solomon when advanced to be king over I&s;rael, prayed for a wi&s;e and under&s;tand|ing heart: God approved his petition as &s;ea&s;onable, and gave a gracious an&s;wer to it. Wi&s;dom is not only nece&s;&s;ary for kings, and for per&s;ons in the highe&s;t &s;eats

of government, but proportionable de|grees of it, for tho&s;e who hold &s;ubordi|nate places. Rulers are compared to <HI>light,</HI> which, by a familiar metaphor, &s;ignifies knowledge. "The heads of the tribes of I&s;&s;achar," cho&s;en to repre|&s;ent their brethren on a certain important occa&s;ion, are expre&s;sly &s;aid to be "men, that had under&s;tanding of the times, to know what I&s;rael ought to do."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Chron.

<P>GOVERNMENT is by no means &s;afe in the hands of weak and ignorant men, how good &s;oever their intentions may be. When &s;uch men have the manage|ment of our public affairs what can we expect, but that they run into confu&s;ion and di&s;order?</P>
<P>NOR is it every kind of knowledge that will qualify a man to govern.

<P>RULERS &s;hould not only be acquain|ted with the natural rights of the people, which are the &s;ame under every form of government, but al&s;o with tho&s;e which originate from the con&s;titution of the country where they live; that they may be tender of both, and able to defend both. They &s;hould know how to &s;tate the bounds of their own authority, and of the rights of the people; that while with firmne&s;s they a&s;&s;ert the former, they may not infringe on the latter.

<P><PB N="27" REF="011289_0026_0F869E40E0722ED0">RELIGION is the other qualifications which I mentioned, as nece&s;&s;ary to the character of a good ruler. He mu&s;t be a man of religion, who di&s;charges the du|ties of magi&s;trate with fidelity. By a man of religion, I mean one that is a true fearer of God, one that is in a good mea|&s;ure &s;antified by his grace, formed to the temper recommended by the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, and &s;incerely endeavors to act up to tho&s;e rules of piety and virtue, which are therein pre&s;cribed.</P>
<P>PIETY towards God is the only ba&s;is, on which a proper conduct towards men, can &s;tand firm and &s;teady again&s;t tho&s;e bla&s;ts of temptation, to which all men are expo&s;ed; and which beat on tho&s;e, that are in elevated &s;tations, with peculiar vi|olence, as &s;torms do on a hou&s;e that &s;tands on an eminence. "He that fears not God, will not regard man," will not regard him, with that tender concern for his pro&s;perity, and that &s;incere endeavor to promote it, which the laws of religion require. True patrioti&s;m (for &s;uch a thing no doubt there is, though many may be &s;trangers to it, who are fond of

the name) hath it's foundation in religion. A vicious man hath no &s;ettled principle of action. He is ruled by &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ions. To gratify the&s;e, he will &s;acrifice his con&s;cience; he will trample on law, when he can do it with impunity; he will betray his friends; he will &s;ell his country; having fir&s;t "&s;old him&s;elf to work" all the&s;e kinds of "wickedne&s;&s;."</P>
<P>DIRECTLY the rever&s;e of this, is the tendency of religion, when it is pure and undefiled. It regulates the pa&s;&s;ions; it enlarges the mind; it fills it with noble, and benevolent de&s;igns; it leads men to enterprize great things for the public good; it drives away the mi&s;ts of preju|dice and temptation, which are &s;o apt to ob&s;cure the path of duty; it in&s;pires a noble fortitude and re&s;olution to pur&s;ue the end of government, though it &s;hould lead through a &s;cene of painful oppo&s;iti|on; though the be&s;t intentions &s;hould be mi&s;con&s;trued, and the mo&s;t important &s;ervices go unrewarded.</P>
<P>Now tho&s;e that are concerned in pro|moting men to public &s;tations, are bound

to have great regard to their virtue and religion.

<P>RULERS ought always to look on their authority as derived to them. They are not originally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any. This con&s;ideration &s;hould make them humble.

The triumphing of wicked rulers, who abu&s;e their power in ways of pride and oppre&s;&s;ion, is generally &s;hort. To one of this character, the remark of the antient &s;age concerning a hypocrite may be ap|plied; "Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds, yet he &s;hall peri&s;h forever:&mdash; They that have &s;een him &s;hall &s;ay Where is he"?<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Job XX.6, 7.</NOTE> When a virtuous people are oppre&s;&s;ed, they may carry their complaints to God, in humble confidence, that he will not long "&s;uffer the rod of the wicked to re&s;t on the lot of the righteous."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm CXXV.3.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE con&s;ideration that their promot|ion cometh from God, &s;hould make rulers careful to improve it in a way, the mo&s;t agreeable to his will, that they can. They do this, when they faithfully pur&s;ue the ends of government; when they &s;tudi|ou&s;ly imitate the &s;upreme ruler of the univer&s;e, "the &s;ceptre of who&s;e king|dom is a right &s;ceptre." Legi&s;lators do this, when they are &s;olicitous that all the laws they enact, be ju&s;t and good, cor|re&s;pondent to tho&s;e of the &s;upreme Law|giver. And tho&s;e that execute the laws,
<PB N="32" REF="011289_0031_0F869E440C9947E0">
when they act in their offices, with &s;tea|dine&s;s and impartiality, that they may be a terror to evil-doers, and a prai&s;e to them that do well. All tho&s;e who are ve&s;ted with authority do this, when they have a tender concern for the rights and pri|vileges of the people, and endeavor to pre&s;erve them entire and inviolate&mdash;when they feel for them under all their burdens; and "in all their afflictions are afflicted"&mdash;when they con&s;true their conduct into the mo&s;t favorable &s;en&s;e it will bear&mdash;when they are ready to pa&s;s by, and excu&s;e as many faults and offences, as will con&s;i&s;t with the regular &s;upport of government&mdash;when they are willing to lo&s;e &s;omething of the &s;everity of the magi&s;trate, in the tenderne&s;s of a father&mdash;In a word; when in their admini&s;tration, "mercy and truth meet together, righ|teou&s;ne&s;s and peace ki&s;s each other."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm LXXXV.10.</NOTE></P>
<P>RULERS &s;hould u&s;e their influence in, an e&s;pecial manner to promote religion. This they &s;hould do, not only by reward|ing virtue, and puni&s;hing vice; but by what is often more influential, their own pious and good example. People in the
<PB N="33" REF="011289_0032_0F869E44EF8D1498">
lower cla&s;&s;es in life, have a peculiar fond|ne&s;s to imitate tho&s;e that are in &s;tations of eminence and dignity. This would operate for the general good, were "great men always wi&s;e," virtuous, and circum|&s;pect, in their conver&s;ation. The morals of a people are greatly affected by tho&s;e of their rulers. Religion flouri&s;hed or declined in I&s;rael very much according to the di&s;po&s;ition and practice of their kings. Solomon ob&s;erved that "if a ruler hearken to lies, all his &s;ervants are wicked."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> Vices receive a currency from the example of princes, as money doth, from their image and &s;uper&s;cription.

But if they are vicious, they are like baleful comets, that &s;pread plagues and de&s;olations through a land, by their malignant influences.</P>
<P>GOD <HI>is the judge,</HI> &s;ays our text. Rulers &s;hould always con&s;ider him in that cha|racter. To him they are accountable for

their conduct. I &s;ay not indeed that they are not, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, accountable to men. The power of government is by God, the original &s;ource of it, lodged in the people. By them it is delegated, un|der divine providence, to certain of their brethren, to be improved for the common good. When therefore they pro&s;titute it to oppre&s;s and en&s;lave, in direct con|tradiction to the ends of government; the people have a right to call them to, account, and to take out of their hands the power which they have &s;o abu&s;ed.</P>
<P>BUT they are e&s;pecially to con&s;ider them&s;elves as accountable to God. They &s;hould remember that he now acts the part of a judge, &s;o far as by his impartial eye to &s;urvey all their coun&s;els, de&s;igns, and actions. They &s;hould con&s;ider him, as always pre&s;ent with them; and that their mo&s;t &s;ecret purpo&s;es and &s;chemes, are "naked and opened to the eyes of him, with whom they have to do"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb.

<P>RULERS &s;hould look forward to that approaching day, when they mu&s;t appear before God's augu&s;t tribunal, and give account of all the talents he hath com|mitted to them. They &s;hould endeavor

to bring that day near in their meditati|ons. It is apt to appear more di&s;tant than it really is, and &s;o le&s;&s;ens to the eye of the mind, as objectd do by their di&s;tance to that of the body.

<P>BUT a pro&s;pect happily different from this&mdash;a pro&s;pect as bright and glorious as this is dark and gloomy, opens upon that ruler, who cultivates in his heart the

<P>FINALLY. Our &s;ubject &s;ugge&s;ts the duty of a people to their rulers. Rulers and &s;ubjects are correlate terms; they can|not &s;ub&s;i&s;t &s;eperately. If God &s;ets &s;ome|in the place of rulers, and inve&s;ts them with a power to govern; He certainly appoints others to the place of &s;ubjects, and makes it their duty to &s;ubmit to go|vernment. People are bound to regard the will and agency of God In clothing per&s;ons with civil authority. When they do &s;o, they will obey "not only for

<P>IT is incumbent on a people chearfully to &s;upport civil government. This is not to be viewed as the part of charity and genero&s;ity, but of ju&s;tice. The &s;up|port of tho&s;e, who employ their time and talents to &s;erve the public, &s;hould be made ea&s;y and honorable.

<P>THERE may indeed be danger that ill|di&s;po&s;ed men&mdash;men di&s;affeted to govern|ment in general, will "u&s;e this liberty," which the God of nature hath given us, "for an occa&s;ion to the fle&s;h," to gratify the di&s;orderly lu&s;ts of it; and &s;o to di&s;turb the peace of the &s;ociety, of which they are members. But this is not a &s;ufficient rea&s;on why we &s;hould di&s;continue our claim to it.</P>
<P>SUBJECTS will, however, find it to their advantage to &s;uffer great inconve|niences, rather than to ri&s;e up again&s;t men in authority. They are not to ex|pect an admini&s;tration without faults. Small faults &s;hould not be remarked on with bitterne&s;s, or mignified with all

A privilege which we have not forfeited; and God forbid we &s;hould, in any future time, be guilty of &s;uch conduct, as might render it ju&s;t to deprive us of it.</P>
<P>WHAT we injoy by charter, is not to be looked upon barely as matter of grace; but, in a mea&s;ure at lea&s;t, of right. Our fathers faithfully performed the conditi|ons, on which charter privileges were granted. To do this they pa&s;&s;ed through a &s;cene of hard&s;hips labors and &s;ufferings. The&s;e were productive of great advan|tages to the mother country. Our char|ter privileges are tho&s;e of Engli&s;hmen; tho&s;e of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution; as our form of government, in this province, is an image in miniature of that of our nation.</P>
