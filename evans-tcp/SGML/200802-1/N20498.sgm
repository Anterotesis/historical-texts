<P>A SHORT contemplation of the animal oeconomy will convince us that life cannot be perpetual, under the pre&s;ent mode of exi&s;tence: For we quickly perceive, by the law of our nature, we are &s;ubjected to changes, di&s;ea&s;e and death. From the fir&s;t di&s;ea&s;e that affected man, the healing art mu&s;t have taken its origin; as it is natural to believe that mankind mu&s;t have been thus early impelled by &s;ickne&s;s and pain to &s;eek the remedies that nature afford|ed for the removal or mitigation of their mi&s;ery.&mdash;It is a plea&s;ing and u&s;eful &s;peculation, to trace our art from this embryo &s;tate to its pre&s;ent condition of improvement and maturity. In the dawn of medical knowledge, the evo|lutions of the human mind mu&s;t have been &s;low and imper|fect. Great di&s;tre&s;s mu&s;t have been &s;uffered before many medical facts could have been inve&s;tigated; and after all, the&s;e mu&s;t have been the re&s;ult of individual exertion. But, in the cour&s;e of revolving time, and by the progre&s;s of civilization, the collective energies of men, under the be|nign influences of freedom and the &s;ocial compact, are con|centred to a point, for accelerating the perfection of the art and &s;ciences. Among the&s;e, if you except agricul|ture, and the art of teaching children to think accurately and act well, the fir&s;t in u&s;e, and the fir&s;t in dignity, is the Healing Art, or the Science of Life&mdash;Yours is the hap|pine&s;s <HI>"to a&s;&s;ociate for the expre&s;s purpo&s;es of promoting

<P>DURING the&s;e periods, mo&s;t of the kingdoms in Europe were over&s;hadowed by impenetrable fore&s;ts, and the greater part of the people lived by hunting and plunder. But, after a long interval of mental and moral darkne&s;s, when agriculture, with the other arts, were re&s;tored, we find no &s;atisfactory account of the progre&s;&s;ive melioration of tho&s;e climates, by clearing the countries of their fore&s;ts and perfecting agriculture.

<P>THESE inquiries will al&s;o a&s;&s;i&s;t the Phy&s;ician in explain|ing and de&s;cribing endemic and epidemic di&s;ea&s;es, as well as the di&s;ea&s;es of cattle and all &s;orts of animals. And, as the pathology of vegetables is a mo&s;t intere&s;ting &s;ubject in the materia medica, and in hu&s;bandry and gardening, the farmer will remember that the&s;e &s;tudies will extend to the di&s;ea&s;es of his fruit-trees, his wheat, his corn, and all the productions of the farm. Will not the farmer then a&s;&s;ociate his labours with the phy&s;ician to record u&s;eful facts on the&s;e &s;ubjects? May not the&s;e &s;tudies enable medical men to a&s;certain the origin of epidemics with more &s;ucce&s;s and certainty than has hitherto been done? Of how much utility this may be to the commercial and political intere&s;ts of our country, need not be mentioned before this enlightened audience.</P>
<P>BUT to effect the&s;e purpo&s;es completely, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to be con&s;tantly making additions of the be&s;t modern publications to the Society's Library, which is already an object of con&s;iderable advantage, e&s;pecially to the junior members. A Library has been called medicine for the mind: A Medical Library is a common bond of union among Phy&s;icians, and it renders the acqui|&s;ition of knowledge cheap and ea&s;y.</P>

THE mariner, from the di&s;tingui&s;hed rank that he holds in modern &s;ociety, and e&s;pecially in all commercial nations, de&s;erves great attention from the Phy&s;ician. Several of the di&s;ea&s;es of &s;eamen, and particularly the &s;curvy&punc; have hitherto baffled medicine. The inve&s;tigation and cure of their di&s;ea&s;es remain, in a great mea&s;ure, for the future labours of medical men. In doing this, many facts may be a&s;certained for the explanation of that mo&s;t remarkable property which exi&s;ts in animal bodies of accommodating them&s;elves to the various condi|tions of life; &s;uch as the changes of climate, heat and cold, diet, action of body and mind, &s;leep and watching, the healing of wounds and the re-union of broken bones.

<P>LET the &s;ober, wi&s;e and judicious part of the public now determine, how much prai&s;e is due to Phy&s;icians for inve&s;tigating and radically curing many of the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>A FEW years ago, it was con&s;idered as a kind of daring impiety, for a Phy&s;ician to attempt the cure of &s;everal di&s;ea&s;es of the mind; particularly tho&s;e of the moral faculty. But as long as we believe that men have the power of re&s;i&s;ting inclination, and to weigh the motives of action, we need not fear the con&s;equences of trying the full effects of medicines that may operate by phy&s;ical nece&s;&s;ity on man. And, let it be remembered, when Hipparchus undertook to number the &s;tars and trace their motions, his attempt was al&s;o derided as impious; becau&s;e, it was con&s;idered as a work that baffled all human labor and ob&s;ervation, and could be done only by the Deity.

Mark what followed: The labors of Hipparchus enabled Paul, a Florentine Phy&s;ician,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In 1474, he corre&s;ponded with Columbus, on the probability of finding India, in the we&s;t. Life of Columbus&punc; by Ferdinand Columbus.</NOTE> to make maps and charts, by which he demon&s;trated to Columbus the globurality of this Planet. All the events in nature are wonder|fully connected together by infinite wi&s;dom, and con&s;pire to make one complete and harmonious plan of Providence! Had it not been for what has fal&s;ely been called the ra&s;h im|piety and enthu&s;ia&s;m of Hipparchus, the old world would never have come to the knowledge of America; and in&s;tead of a&s;&s;ociating together, under a free government, to promote the intere&s;ts of humanity, mo&s;t of us who are pre&s;ent would, at this moment, have been the va&s;&s;als of &s;ome European de&s;pot, as was once the lot of our per&s;ecuted ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>MAY it be the di&s;tingui&s;hed fortune of &s;ome American Phy&s;icians, to become in the medical world, what Hippar|chus and Columbus were in A&s;tronomy and Navigation!</P>
<P>To the prai&s;e of America, there is a native of this country, who, by uniting the three characters of Philo|&s;opher, Patriot and Phy&s;ician&punc; (need I name Dr. Ru&s;h?) has done much towards inve&s;tigating, explaining and curing many of the mental di&s;ea&s;es.

<P>THE doctrine of the a&s;&s;ociation of ideas is more u&s;eful to the Phy&s;ician, than to the Profe&s;&s;or of any other art.

Then it became the policy of Kings to check the encroachments of the Patri|cians,
<PB N="35" REF="026892_0034_0FD24B7B84645BF0">
or Nobles, on the u&s;urped and regal power; and artfully to &s;trengthen and increa&s;e this power, which was ever operating the degradation and mi&s;ery of mankind, by giving, as it was then fal&s;ely called, privileges to the Plebeians, or Pea&s;antry, and &s;o defending them again&s;t the equally unju&s;t claims of the Barons, in uniting them in the &s;upport of Monarchy, which was con&s;tantly at war with Ari&s;tocracy. In America, there is no Pea&s;antry; but in room of it, a collective and united body of Hu&s;band|men, called THE FREE YEOMANRY. There are more modern Corporations, with peculiar powers, which have ended in monopolies. The&s;e, fir&s;t, fattened on the blood and tears of the natives of the Ea&s;t and We&s;t-Indies, and having become enebriated with the &s;weat, extorted from the &s;lave-wearied limbs of the Sons of Africa, they, afterwards, corrupt Society, with their unju&s;tly accumulated wealth, and de&s;troy them&s;elves.

<P>WHEN Mirabeau, Condorcet, and that bright phalanx of patriots and heroes, arrayed, in the divine panoply of rea&s;on, waged &s;ucce&s;sful war again&s;t the many-headed mon|&s;ter, Tyranny, thou, O FREEDOM! did&s;t nerve their mighty arm with more than herculean &s;trength.</P>
<P>THESE are the men who&s;e fame will live forever: The&s;e are the benefactors of mankind: their glory will embrace all the future generations of men. Who can &s;top the progre&s;s of their works! What can check the progre&s;s of truth! As &s;oon might man &s;tretch forth his feeble arm and &s;ay to you bright orb of day, retire and cea&s;e to &s;hine.</P>
<P>BUT, what &s;hall we &s;ay of the Legi&s;lators and Heroes of America? The&s;e all uttered their voices, &s;trong as rea&s;on and &s;ublime as heaven, &s;aying, <HI>Let America be free, and America was free.</HI> Under the au&s;pices of that freedom, in this Hall, are we now a&s;&s;embled.</P>
