<P>SCARCELY had the Abbey-bell tolled for five minutes, and already was the church of the Capu|chins thronged with auditors. Do not encourage the idea, that the crowd was a&s;&s;embled either from mo|tives of piety, or thir&s;t of information. But very few were influenced with tho&s;e rea&s;ons; and in a city where &s;uper&s;tition reigns with &s;uch de&s;potic &s;way as in Madrid, to &s;eek for true devotion would be a fruitle&s;s attempt. The audience now a&s;&s;embled in the Capuchin church was collected by various cau&s;es, but all of them were foreign to the o&s;ten&s;ible motive. The women came to &s;how them&s;elves, the men to &s;ee the women: &s;ome were attracted by curio&s;ity to hear an orator &s;o celebrated; &s;ome came, becau&s;e they had no better means of employing their time till the play began; &s;ome, from being a&s;&s;ured that it would be impo&s;&s;ible to find places in the church; and one half of Madrid was brought thither by expecting
<PB N="10" REF="035729_0008_100657EA2F5E5BA8">
to meet the other half. The only per&s;ons truly anx|ious to hear the preacher, were a few antiquated de|votees, and half a dozen rival orators, determined to find fault with and ridicule the di&s;cour&s;e. As to the remainder of the audience, the &s;ermon might have been omitted altogether, certainly without their being di&s;appointed, and very probably without their per|ceiving the omi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Whatever was the occa&s;ion, it is at lea&s;t certain, that the Capuchin church had never witne&s;&s;ed a more numerous a&s;&s;embly. Every corner was filled, every &s;eat was occupied. The very &s;tatues which ornamented the long ai&s;les were pre&s;&s;ed into the &s;ervice. Boys &s;u&s;pended them&s;elves upon the wings of Cherubims; St. Francis and St. Mark bore each a &s;pectator on his &s;houlders; and St. Agatha found her&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of carrying double. The con&s;equence was, that, in &s;pite of all their hurry and expedition, our two new comers, on entering the church, looked round in vain for places.</P>
<P>However, the old woman continued to move for|ward. In vain were exclamations of di&s;plea&s;ure vented again&s;t her from all &s;ides: in vain was &s;he addre&s;&s;ed with, "I a&s;&s;ure you Segnora, there are no places here." "I beg, Segnora, that you will not crowd me &s;o intolerably!" "Segnora, you cannot pa&s;s this way. Ble&s;s me! How can people be &s;o trouble&s;ome!" The old woman was ob&s;tinate, and on &s;he went. By dint of per&s;everance and two brawny arms, &s;he made a pa&s;&s;age through the crowd, and man|aged to bu&s;tle her&s;elf into the very body of the church, at no great di&s;tance from the pulpit. Her compan|ion
<PB N="11" REF="035729_0009_100657AB16F51EF8">
had followed her with timidity and in &s;ilence, profiting by the exertions of her conductre&s;s.</P>
<P>"Holy Virgin!" exclaimed the old woman in a tone of di&s;appointment, while &s;he threw a glance of inquiry round her; "Holy Virgin! what heat! what a crowd! I wonder what can be the meaning of all this. I believe we mu&s;t return: there is no &s;uch thing as a &s;eat to be had, and nobody &s;eems kind enough to accommodate us with theirs."</P>
<P>This broad hint attracted the notice of two cava|liers, who occupied &s;tools on the right hand, and were leaning their backs again&s;t the &s;eventh column from the pulpit. Both were young, and richly habited. Hearing this appeal to their politene&s;s pronounced in a female voice, they interrupted their conver&s;ation to look at the &s;peaker. She had thrown up her veil in order to take a clearer look round the cathedral. Her hair was red, and &s;he &s;quinted. The cavaliers turned round and renewed their conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>"By all means," replied the old woman's compan|ion; "by all means, Leonella, let us return home immediately: the heat is exce&s;&s;ive, and I am terrifi|ed at &s;uch a crowd."</P>
<P>The&s;e words were pronounced in a tone of unex|ampled &s;weetne&s;s. The cavaliers again broke off their di&s;cour&s;e: but for this time they were not contented with looking up, but &s;tarted involuntarily from their &s;eats, and turned them&s;elves towards the &s;peaker.</P>
<P>The voice came from a female, the delicacy and elegance of who&s;e figure in&s;pired the youths with the
<PB N="12" REF="035729_0010_100657EBB61A0578">
mo&s;t lively curio&s;ity to view the face to which it be|longed. This &s;atisfaction was denied them. Her features were hidden by a thick veil; but &s;truggling through the crowd had deranged it &s;ufficiently to di&s;|cover a neck which for &s;ymmetry and beauty might have vied with the Medicean Venus. It was of the mo&s;t dazzling whitene&s;s, and received additional charms from being &s;haded by the tre&s;&s;es of her long fair hair, which de&s;cended in ringlets to her wai&s;t. Her figure was rather below than above the middle &s;ize: it was light and airy as that of an Hamadryad. Her bo&s;om was carefully veiled. Her dre&s;s was white; it was fa&s;tened by a blue &s;a&s;h, and ju&s;t per|mitted to peep out from under it a little foot of the mo&s;t delicate proportions. A chaplet of large grains hung upon her arm, and her face was covered with a veil of thick black gauze. Such was the female, to whom the younge&s;t of the cavaliers now offered his &s;eat, while the other thought it nece&s;&s;ary to pay the &s;ame attention to her companion.</P>
<P>The old lady with many expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude, but without much difficulty, accepted the offer, and &s;eated her&s;elf: the young one followed her example, but made no other compliment than a &s;imple and graceful reverence. Don Lorenzo (&s;uch was the cav|alier's name who&s;e &s;eat &s;he had accepted) placed him|&s;elf near her; but fir&s;t he whi&s;pered a few words in his friend's ear, who immediately took the hint, and endeavoured to draw off the old woman's attention from her lovely charge.</P>
<P>"You are doubtle&s;s lately arrived at Madrid?" &s;aid Lorenzo to his fair neighbour: "It is impo&s;&s;ible that &s;uch charms &s;hould have long remained unob|&s;erved;
<PB N="13" REF="035729_0011_100657AD4CA06430">
and had not this been your fir&s;t public appear|ance, the envy of the women and adoration of the men would have rendered you already &s;ufficiently re|markable."</P>
<P>He pau&s;ed in expectation of an an&s;wer. As his &s;peech did not ab&s;olutely require one, the lady did not open her lips. After a few moments he re&s;umed his di&s;cour&s;e:</P>
<P>"Am I wrong in &s;uppo&s;ing you to be a &s;tranger to Madrid?"</P>
<P>The lady he&s;itated; and at la&s;t, in &s;o low a voice as to be &s;carcely intelligible, &s;he made &s;hift to an&s;wer, "No, Segnor."</P>
<P>"Do you intend making a &s;tay of any length?"</P>
<P>"Yes, Segnor."</P>
<P>"I &s;hould e&s;teem my&s;elf fortunate, were it in my power to contribute to making your abode agreeable. I am well known at Madrid, and my family has &s;ome intere&s;t at court. If I can be of any &s;ervice, you cannot honor or oblige me more than by permitting me to be of u&s;e to you." "Surely," &s;aid he to him|&s;elf, "&s;he cannot an&s;wer that by a mono&s;yllable; now &s;he mu&s;t &s;ay &s;omething to me."</P>
<P>Lorenzo was deceived, for the lady an&s;wered only by a bow.</P>
<P>By this time he had di&s;covered, that his neighbour was not very conver&s;ible; but whether her &s;ilence proceeded from pride, di&s;cretion, timidity, or idiot|i&s;m, he was &s;till unable to decide.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="035729_0012_100657ED824803D0">
After a pau&s;e of &s;ome minutes, "It is certainly from your being a &s;tranger," &s;aid he, "and as yet unacquainted with our cu&s;toms, that you continue to wear your veil. Permit me to remove it."</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time he advanced his hand towards the gauze; the lady rai&s;ed hers to prevent him.</P>
<P>"I never unveil in public, Segnor."</P>
<P>"And where is the harm, I pray you?" interrupt|ed her companion &s;omewhat &s;harply. "Do not you &s;ee, that the other ladies have all laid their veils a&s;ide, to do honor, no doubt, to the holy place in which we are? I have taken off mine already; and &s;urely, if I expo&s;e my features to general ob&s;ervation, you have no cau&s;e to put your&s;elf in &s;uch a wonderful alarm! Ble&s;&s;ed Maria! Here is a fu&s;s and a bu&s;tle about a chit's face! Come, come, child! Uncover it! I warrant you that nobody will run away with it from you&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Dear aunt, it is not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he cu&s;tom in Murcia&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Murcia, indeed! Holy St. Barbara! what does that &s;ignify? You are always putting me in mind of that villainous province. If it is the cu&s;tom in Ma|drid, that is all that we ought to mind; and therefore I de&s;ire you to take off your veil immediately. Obey me this moment, Antonia, for you know that I can|not bear contradiction."</P>
<P>Her niece was &s;ilent, but made no further oppo&s;i|tion to Don Lorenzo's efforts, who, armed with the aunt's &s;anction, ha&s;tened to remove the gauze. What a &s;eraph's head pre&s;ented it&s;elf to his admiration!
<PB N="15" REF="035729_0013_100657AFA32709E8">
Yet it was rather bewitching than beautiful; it was not &s;o lovely from regularity of features as from &s;weetne&s;s and &s;en&s;ibility of countenance. The &s;ev|eral parts of her face con&s;idered &s;eparately, many of them were far from hand&s;ome; but, when examined together, the whole was adorable. Her &s;kin, though fair, was not entirely without freckles; her eyes were not very large, nor their la&s;hes particularly long. But then her lips were of the mo&s;t ro&s;y fre&s;hne&s;s; her fair and undulating hair, confined by a &s;imple rib|and, poured it&s;elf below her wai&s;t in a profu&s;ion of ringlets; her neck was full and beautiful in the ex|treme; her hand and arm were formed with the mo&s;t perfect &s;ymmetry; her mild blue eyes &s;eemed an heaven of &s;weetne&s;s, and the cry&s;tal in which they moved &s;parkled with all the brilliance of diamonds. She appeared to be &s;carcely fifteen; an arch &s;mile playing round her mouth, declared her to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of liveline&s;s, which exce&s;s of timidity at pre&s;ent re|pre&s;&s;ed. She looked round her with a ba&s;hful glance; and whenever her eyes accidentally met Lorenzo's, &s;he dropped them ha&s;tily upon her ro&s;ary; her cheek was immediately &s;uffu&s;ed with blu&s;hes, and &s;he began to tell her beads; though her manner evidently &s;how|ed that &s;he knew not what &s;he was about.</P>
<P>Lorenzo gazed upon her with mingled &s;urpri&s;e and admiration; but the aunt thought it nece&s;&s;ary to apologize for Antonia's <HI>mauvai&s;e honte.</HI></P>
<P>"'Tis a young creature," &s;aid &s;he, "who is totally ignorant of the world. She has been brought up in an old ca&s;tle in Murcia, with no other &s;ociety than her mother's, who, God help her! has no more &s;en&s;e, good &s;oul, than is nece&s;&s;ary to carry her &s;oup to her
<PB N="16" REF="035729_0014_100657EF0A8DFB08">
mouth. Yet &s;he is my own &s;i&s;ter, both by father and mother."</P>
<P>"And has &s;o little &s;en&s;e?" &s;aid Don Chri&s;toval with feigned a&s;toni&s;hment, "How very extraordi|nary!"</P>
<P>"Very true, Segnor. Is it not &s;trange? However, &s;uch is the fact; and yet only to &s;ee the luck of &s;ome people! A young nobleman, of the very fir&s;t quality, took it into his head that Elvira had &s;ome preten&s;ions to beauty. As to preten&s;ions, in truth &s;he had al|ways enough of <HI>them;</HI> but as to beauty! If I had only taken half the pains to &s;et my&s;elf off which &s;he did! But this is neither here nor there. As I was &s;aying, Segnor, a young nobleman fell in love with her, and married her unknown to his father. Their union remained a &s;ecret near three years; but at la&s;t it came to the ears of the old marquis, who, as you may well &s;uppo&s;e, was not much plea&s;ed with the intelli|gence. Away he po&s;ted in all ha&s;te to Cordova, de|termined to &s;eize Elvira, and &s;end her away to &s;ome place or other, where &s;he would never be heard of more. Holy St. Paul! How he &s;tormed on finding that &s;he had e&s;caped him, had joined her hu&s;band, and that they had embarked together for the Indies! He &s;wore at us all, as if the evil &s;pirit had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him; he threw my father into pri&s;on&mdash;as hone&s;t a pains|taking &s;hoe-maker as any in Cordova; and when he went away, he had the cruelty to take from us my &s;i&s;ter's little boy, then &s;carcely two years old, and whom in the abruptne&s;s of her flight &s;he had been obliged to leave behind her. I &s;uppo&s;e that the poor little wretch met with bitter bad treatment from him, for in a few month<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> after we received intelligence of his death."</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="035729_0015_100657B2A1883A80">
"Why, this was a terrible old fellow, Segnora!"</P>
<P>"Oh! &s;hocking! and a man &s;o totally devoid of ta&s;te! Why, would you believe it, Segnor? when I attempted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> pacify him, he cur&s;ed me for a witch, and wi&s;hed that, to puni&s;h the count, my &s;i&s;ter might become as ugly as my&s;elf&mdash;Ugly indeed! I like him for that."</P>
<P>"Ridiculous!" cried Don Chri&s;toval. "Doubt|le&s;s the count would have thought him&s;elf fortunate, had he been permitted to exchange the one &s;i&s;ter for the other."</P>
<P>"O! Chri&s;t! Segnor, you are really too polite. However, I am heartily glad that the cond&eacute; was of a different way of thinking. A mighty pretty piece of bu&s;ine&s;s, to be &s;ure, Elvira has made of it! After broiling and &s;tewing in the Indies for thirteen long years, her hu&s;band dies, and &s;he returns to Spain, without a hou&s;e to hide her head, or money to pro|cure her one! This Antonia was then but an infant, and her only remaining child.

This had been the favourite habitation of his elde&s;t &s;on; but, &s;ince his flight from Spain, the old marquis could not bear the place, but let it fall to ruin and confu&s;ion: My &s;i&s;ter accepted the propo&s;al; &s;he retired to Murcia, and has remained there till within the la&s;t month."</P>

"And what brings her now to Madrid?" inquired Don Lorenzo, whom admiration of the young Anto|nia compelled to take a lively intere&s;t in the talkative old woman's narration.</P>
<P>"Alas! Segnor, her father-in-law being lately dead, the &s;teward of his Murcian e&s;tates has refu&s;ed to pay her pen&s;ion any longer. With the de&s;ign of &s;upplicating his &s;on to renew it, &s;he is now come to Madrid; but I doubt that &s;he might have &s;aved her|&s;elf the trouble. You young noblemen have always enough to do with your money, and are not very often di&s;po&s;ed to throw it away upon old women. I ad|vi&s;ed my &s;i&s;ter to &s;end Antonia with her petition; but &s;he would not hear of &s;uch a thing. She is &s;o ob&s;ti|nate! Well! &s;he will find her&s;elf the wor&s;e for not following my coun&s;els: the girl has a good pretty face, and po&s;&s;ibly might have done much."</P>
<P>"Ah, Segnora!" interrupted Don Chri&s;toval, counterfeiting a pa&s;&s;ionate air; "if a pretty face will do the bu&s;ine&s;s, why has not your &s;i&s;ter recour&s;e to you?"</P>
<P>"Oh! Je&s;us! my lord, I &s;wear you quite over|power me with your gallantry! But I promi&s;e you that I am too well aware of the danger of &s;uch ex|peditions to tru&s;t my&s;elf in a young nobleman's pow|er! No, no; I have as yet pre&s;erved my reputation without blemi&s;h or reproach, and I always knew how to keep the men at a proper di&s;tance."</P>
<P>"Of that, Segnora, I have not the lea&s;t doubt. But permit me to a&s;k you, Have you then any aver|&s;ion to Matrimony?"</P>

"That is an home que&s;tion. I cannot but confe&s;s, that if an amiable cavalier were to pre&s;ent him&s;elf&mdash;"</P>
<P>Here &s;he intended to throw a tender and &s;ignificant look upon Don Chri&s;toval; but, as &s;he unluckily hap|pened to &s;quint mo&s;t abominably, the glance fell di|rectly upon his companion. Lorenzo took the com|pliment to him&s;elf, and an&s;wered it by a profound bow.</P>
<P>"May I inquire," &s;aid he, "the name of the marquis?"</P>
<P>"The marquis de las Ci&s;ternas."</P>
<P>"I know him intimately well. He is not at pre&s;|ent in Madrid, but is expected here daily. He is one of the be&s;t of men; and if the lovely Antonia will permit me to be her advocate with him, I doubt not my being able to make a favourable report of her cau&s;e."</P>
<P>Antonia rai&s;ed her blue eyes, and &s;ilently thanked him for the offer by a &s;mile of inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;weetne&s;s. Leonella's &s;atisfaction was much more loud and audi|ble. Indeed, as her niece was generally &s;ilent in company, &s;he thought it incumbent upon her to talk enough for both: this &s;he managed without difficulty, for &s;he very &s;eldom found her&s;elf deficient in words.</P>
<P>"Oh, Segnor!" &s;he cried; "you will lay our whole family under the mo&s;t &s;ignal obligations! I ac|cept your offer with all po&s;&s;ible gratitude, and return you a thou&s;and thanks for the genero&s;ity of your pro|po&s;al. Antonia, why do you not &s;peak, child? While the cavalier &s;ays all &s;orts of civil things to you, you &s;it like a &s;tatue, and never utter a &s;yllable of thanks, either bad, good, or indifferent!"</P>

"My dear aunt, I am very &s;en&s;ible that&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Fye, niece! How often have I told you, that you never &s;hould interrupt a per&s;on who is &s;peaking! When did you ever know me do &s;uch a thing? Are the&s;e your Murcian manners? Mercy on me! I &s;hall never be able to make this girl any thing like a per&s;on of good breeding. But pray, Segnor," &s;he continued, addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to Don Chri&s;toval, "in|form me, why &s;uch a crowd is a&s;&s;embled to-day in this cathedral."</P>
<P>"Can you po&s;&s;ibly be ignorant, that Ambro&s;io, abbot of this mona&s;tery, pronounces a &s;ermon in this church every Thur&s;day? All Madrid rings with his prai&s;es. As yet he has preached but thrice; but all who have heard him are &s;o delighted with his eloquence, that it is as difficult to obtain a place at church, as at the fir&s;t repre&s;entation of a new comedy. His fame certainly mu&s;t have reached your ears?"</P>
<P>"Alas! Segnor, till ye&s;terday I never had the good fortune to &s;ee Madrid; and at Cordova we are &s;o lit|tle informed of what is pa&s;&s;ing in the re&s;t of the world, that the name of Ambro&s;io has never been mentioned in its precincts."</P>
<P>"You will find it in every one's mouth at Madrid. He &s;eems to have fa&s;cinated the inhabitants; and, not having attended his &s;ermons my&s;elf, I am a&s;toni&s;hed at the enthu&s;ia&s;m which he has excited. The adora|tion paid him both by young and old, by man and woman, is unexampled. The grandees load him with pre&s;ents; their wives refu&s;e to have any other confe&s;|&s;or; and he is known through all the city by the name of the Man of Holine&s;s."</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="035729_0019_100657B6C3419670">
"Undoubtedly, Segnor, he is of noble origin?"</P>
<P>"That point &s;till remains undecided. The late &s;uperior of the Capuchins found him while yet an in|fant at the abbey-door. All attempts to di&s;cover who had left him there were vain, and the child him&s;elf could give no account of his parents. He was edu|cated in the mona&s;tery, where he has remained ever &s;ince. He early &s;howed a &s;trong inclination for &s;tudy and retirement; and as &s;oon as he was of a proper age, he pronounced his vows. No one has ever ap|peared to claim him, or clear up the my&s;tery which conceals his birth; and the monks, who find their ac|count in the favor which is &s;hown to their e&s;tabli&s;h|ment from re&s;pect to him, have not he&s;itated to pub|li&s;h, that he is a pre&s;ent to them from the Virgin. In truth, the &s;ingular au&s;terity of his life gives &s;ome countenance to the report. He is now thirty years old, every hour of which period has been pa&s;&s;ed in &s;tudy, total &s;eclu&s;ion from the world, and mortification of the fle&s;h. Till the&s;e la&s;t three weeks, when he was cho&s;en &s;uperior of the &s;ociety to which he belongs, he had never been on the out&s;ide of the abbey-walls. E|ven now he never quits them except on Thur&s;days, when he delivers a di&s;cour&s;e in this cathedral, which all Madrid a&s;&s;embles to hear. His knowledge is &s;aid to be the mo&s;t profound, his eloquence the mo&s;t per|&s;ua&s;ive. In the whole cour&s;e of his life he has never been known to tran&s;gre&s;s a &s;ingle rule of his order; the &s;malle&s;t &s;tain is not to be di&s;covered upon his character: and the common people e&s;teem him to be a &s;aint."</P>
<P>Here Don Chri&s;toval was interrupted by an uni|ver&s;al murmur, which ran through the church; it an|nounced
<PB N="22" REF="035729_0020_100657F615B70178">
the preacher's arrival. Donna Leonella ro&s;e from her &s;eat to take a better view of him, and Anto|nia followed her example.</P>
<P>He was a man of noble port and commanding pre|&s;ence. His &s;tature was lofty, and his features uncom|monly hand&s;ome. His no&s;e was aquiline, his eyes large, black and &s;parkling, and his dark brows almo&s;t joined together. His complexion was of a deep but clear brown; &s;tudy and watching had entirely depriv|ed his cheek of color. Tranquillity reigned upon his &s;mooth unwrinkled forehead; and content, expre&s;&s;ed upon every feature, &s;eemed to announce the man equally unacquainted with cares and crimes. He bow|ed him&s;elf with humility to the audience. Still there was a certain &s;everity in his look and manner that in|&s;pired univer&s;al awe, and few could &s;u&s;tain the glance of his eye, at once fiery and penetrating. Such was Ambro&s;io, abbot of the Capuchins, and &s;urnamed "The Man of Holine&s;s."</P>
<P>Antonia, while &s;he gazed upon him eagerly, felt a plea&s;ure fluttering in her bo&s;om which till then had been unknown to her, and for which &s;he in vain en|deavoured <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o account. She waited with impatience till the &s;ermon &s;hould begin; and when at length the friar &s;poke, the &s;ound of his voice &s;eemed to pene|trate into her very &s;oul. Though no other of the &s;pectators felt &s;uch violent &s;en&s;ations as did the young Antonia, yet every one li&s;tened with intere&s;t and emo|tion. They who were in&s;en&s;ible to religion's merits, were &s;till enchanted with Ambro&s;io's oratory. All found their attention irre&s;i&s;tibly attracted while he &s;poke, and the mo&s;t profound &s;ilence reigned through
<PB N="23" REF="035729_0021_100657B89A43FFC0">
the crouded ai&s;les. Even Lorenzo could not re&s;i&s;t the charm; he forgot that Antonia was &s;eated near him, and li&s;tened to the preacher with undivided attention.</P>
<P>In language nervous, clear and &s;imple, the monk expatiated on the beauties of religion. He explained &s;ome ab&s;tru&s;e parts of the &s;acred writings in a &s;tyle that carried with it univer&s;al conviction. His voice at once di&s;tinct and deep, was fraught with all the terrors of the tempe&s;t, while he inveighed again&s;t the vices of humanity, and de&s;cribed the puni&s;hments re|&s;erved for them in a future &s;tate. Every hearer look|ed back upon his pa&s;t offences, and trembled: the thunder &s;eemed to roll, who&s;e bolt was de&s;tined to cru&s;h him, and the aby&s;s of eternal de&s;truction to op|en before his feet! But when Ambro&s;io, changing his theme, &s;poke of the excellence of an un&s;ullied con|&s;cience, of the glorious pro&s;pect which eternity pre|&s;ented to the &s;oul untainted with reproach, and of the recompence which awaited it in the regions of ever|la&s;ting glory, his auditors felt their &s;cattered &s;pirits in|&s;en&s;ibly return. They threw them&s;elves with confi|dence upon the mercy of their Judge; they hung with delight upon the con&s;oling words of the preacher; and while his full voice &s;welled into melody, they were tran&s;ported to tho&s;e happy regions which he painted to their imaginations in colors &s;o brilliant and glowing.</P>
<P>The di&s;cour&s;e was of con&s;iderable length; yet, when it concluded, the audience grieved that it had not la&s;ted longer. Though the monk had cea&s;ed to &s;peak, enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;ilence &s;till prevailed through the church. At length the charm gradually di&s;&s;olving,
<PB N="24" REF="035729_0022_100657F79FE1CDE0">
the general admiration was expre&s;&s;ed in audible terms. As Ambro&s;io de&s;cended from the pulpit, his auditors crowded round him, loaded him with ble&s;&s;ings, threw them&s;elves at his feet, and ki&s;&s;ed the hem of his gar|ment. He pa&s;&s;ed on &s;lowly, with his hands cro&s;&s;ed devoutly upon his bo&s;om, to the door opening into the abbey-chapel, at which his monks waited to re|ceive him. He a&s;cended the &s;teps, and then, turn|ing towards his followers, addre&s;&s;ed to them a few words of gratitude and exhortation. While he &s;poke, his ro&s;ary, compo&s;ed of large grains of amber, fell from his hand, and dropped among the &s;urrounding multitude. It was &s;eized eagerly, and immediately divided among&s;t the &s;pectators. Whoever became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of a bead, pre&s;erved it as a &s;acred rel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">que; and had it been the chaplet of thrice ble&s;&s;ed St. Fran|cis him&s;elf, it could not have been di&s;puted with greater vivacity. The abbot, &s;miling at their eager|ne&s;s, pronounced his benediction and quitted the church, while humility dwelt upon every feature. Dwelt &s;he al&s;o in his heart?</P>
<P>Antonia's eyes followed him with anxiety. As the door clo&s;ed after him, it &s;eemed to her as &s;he had lo&s;t &s;ome one, e&s;&s;ential to her happine&s;s. A tear &s;tole in &s;ilence down her cheek.</P>
<P>"He is &s;eparated from the world!" &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf; "perhaps, I &s;hall never &s;ee him more!"</P>
<P>As &s;he wiped away the tear, Lorenzo ob&s;erved her action.</P>
<P>"Are you &s;atisfied with our orator?" &s;aid he; "or do you think that Madrid overrates his talents?"</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="035729_0023_100657BBB706E230">
Antonia's heart was &s;o filled with admiration for the monk, that &s;he eagerly &s;eize<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> opportunity of &s;peaking of him: be&s;ides, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> longer con|&s;idered Lorenzo as an ab&s;olute &s;tranger, &s;he was le&s;s embarra&s;&s;ed by her exce&s;&s;ive timidity.</P>
<P>"Oh! he far exceeds all my expectations," an|&s;wered &s;he; "till this moment I had no idea of the powers of eloquence. But when he &s;poke, his voice in&s;pired me with &s;uch intere&s;t, &s;uch e&s;teem, I might almo&s;t &s;ay &s;uch affection for him, that I am my&s;elf a&s;toni&s;hed at the acutene&s;s of my feelings."</P>
<P>Lorenzo &s;miled at the &s;trength of her expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>"You are young, and ju&s;t entering into life," &s;aid he: "your heart, new to the world, and full of warmth and &s;en&s;ibility, receives its fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions with eagerne&s;s. Artle&s;s your&s;elf, you &s;u&s;pect not others of deceit; and viewing the world through the medium of your own truth and innocence, you fancy all who &s;urround you to de&s;erve your confidence and e&s;teem. What pity, that the&s;e gay vi&s;ions mu&s;t &s;oon be di&s;&s;ipated! What pity, that you mu&s;t &s;oon di&s;cover the ba&s;ene&s;s of mankind, and guard again&s;t your fel|low-creatures as again&s;t your foes!"</P>
<P>"Alas! Segnor," replied Antonia, "the misfor|tunes of my parents have already placed before me but too many &s;ad examples of the perfidy of the world! Yet &s;urely in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance the warmth of &s;ym|pathy cannot have deceived me."</P>
<P>"In the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, I allow that it has not. Ambro&s;io's character is perfectly without reproach; and a man who has pa&s;&s;ed the whole of his life within

the walls of a convent, cannot have found the oppor|tunity to be guilty, even were he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the in|clination. But now, when obliged by the duties of his &s;ituation, he mu&s;t enter occa&s;ionally into the world, and be thrown into the way of temptation, it is now that it behoves him to &s;how the brilliance of his vir|tue. The trial is dangerous; he is ju&s;t at that period of life when the pa&s;&s;ions are mo&s;t vigorous, unbridled, and de&s;potic; his e&s;tabli&s;hed reputation will mark him out to &s;eduction as an illu&s;trious victim; novelty will give additional charms to the allurements of plea&s;ure; and even the talents with which nature has endowed him will contribute to his ruin, by fa|cilitating the means of obtaining his object. Very few would return victorious from a conte&s;t &s;o &s;evere."</P>
<P>"Ah! &s;urely Ambro&s;io will be one of tho&s;e few."</P>
<P>"Of that I have my&s;elf no doubt: by all accounts he is an exception to mankind in general, and envy would &s;eek in vain for a blot upon his character."</P>
<P>"Segnor, you delight me by this a&s;&s;urance! It en|courages me to indulge my prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in his favor; and you know not with what pain I &s;hould have re|pre&s;&s;ed the &s;entiment! Ah! deare&s;t aunt, entreat my mother to choo&s;e him for our confe&s;&s;or."</P>
<P>"I entreat her!" replied Leonella: "I promi&s;e you that I &s;hall do no &s;uch thing. I do not like this &s;ame Ambro&s;io in the lea&s;t; he has a look of &s;everity about him that made me tremble from head to foot. Were he my confe&s;&s;or, I &s;hould never have the courage to avow one half of my peccadilloes, and then I &s;hould be in a rare condition!

<P>"You are right, Segnora," an&s;wered Don Chri&s;|toval. "Too great &s;everity is &s;aid to be Ambro&s;io's only fault. Exempted him&s;elf from human failings, he is not &s;ufficiently indulgent to tho&s;e of others; and though &s;trictly ju&s;t and di&s;intere&s;ted in his deci&s;ions, his government of the monks has already &s;hown &s;ome proofs of his inflexibility.

<P>"O Chri&s;t! Segnor," exclaimed Leonella, affect|ing to blu&s;h; "I would not &s;uffer &s;uch a thing for the univer&s;e!

<P>"It is out of my power. I only arrived la&s;t night at Madrid, and have not yet had an opportunity of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eeing my &s;i&s;ter. You know that her convent is in this &s;treet, and I was going thither when the crowd which I &s;aw thronging into this church excited my curio&s;ity to know what was the matter.

<P>"Your &s;i&s;ter in a convent, &s;ay you? Oh! very true: I had forgotten. And how does Donna Agnes? I am amazed, Don Lorenzo, how you could po&s;&s;i|bly think of immuring &s;o charming a girl within the walls of a cloi&s;ter?"</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="035729_0029_100657C22023DC08">
"I think of it, Don Chri&s;toval? How can you &s;u&s;|pect me of &s;uch barbarity? You are con&s;cious that &s;he took the veil by her own de&s;ire, and that particular circum&s;tances made her wi&s;h for a &s;eclu&s;ion from the world. I u&s;ed every means in my power to induce her to change her re&s;olution; the endeavor was fruit|le&s;s, and I lo&s;t a &s;i&s;ter!"</P>
<P>"The luckier fellow you: I think, Lorenzo, you were a con&s;iderable gainer by that lo&s;s: if I remem|ber right, Donna Agnes had a portion of ten thou&s;and pi&s;toles, half of which reverted to your lord&s;hip. By St. Jago! I wi&s;h that I had fifty &s;i&s;ters in the &s;am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> predicament. I &s;hould con&s;ent to lo&s;ing them every &s;oul without much heart-burning."</P>
<P>"How, Cond&eacute;?" &s;aid Lorenzo, in an angry voice; "Do you &s;uppo&s;e me ba&s;e enough to have influenced my &s;i&s;ter's retirement? do you &s;uppo&s;e that the de&s;pi|cable wi&s;h to make my&s;elf ma&s;ter of her fortune could&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Admirable! Courage, Don Lorenzo! Now the man is all in a blaze. God grant that Antonia may &s;often that fiery temper, or we &s;hall certainly cut each other's throat before the month is over! How|ever, to prevent &s;uch a tragical cata&s;trophe for the pre&s;ent, I &s;hall make a retreat, and leave you ma&s;ter of the field. Farewell, my knight of Mount AEtna! Moderate that inflammable di&s;po&s;ition, and remember, that whenever it is nece&s;&s;ary to make love to yonder harridan, you may reckon upon my &s;ervices."</P>
<P>He &s;aid, and darted out of the cathedral. "How wild-brained!" &s;aid Lorenzo, "With &s;o excellent a heart, what pity that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;o little &s;olidity of judgment!"</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="035729_0030_100657FE9F9F2760">
The night was now fa&s;t advancing. The lamps were not yet lighted. The faint beams of the ri&s;ing moon &s;carcely could pierce through the gothic ob|&s;curity of the church. Lorenzo found him&s;elf unable to quit the &s;pot. The void left in his bo&s;om by An|tonia's ab&s;ence, and his &s;i&s;ter's &s;acrifice which Don Chri&s;toval had ju&s;t recalled to his imagination, cre|ated that melancholy of mind which accorded but too well with the religious gloom &s;urrounding him. He was &s;till leaning again&s;t the &s;eventh column from the pulpit. A &s;oft and cooling air breathed along the &s;olitary ai&s;les; the moon beams darting into the church through painted windows, tinged the fretted roofs and ma&s;&s;y pillars with a thou&s;and various &s;hades of light and colors. Univer&s;al &s;ilence prevailed around, only interrupted by the occa&s;ional clo&s;ing of doors in the adjoining abbey.</P>
<P>The calm of the hour and &s;olitude of the place contributed to nouri&s;h Lorenzo's di&s;po&s;ition to mel|ancholy. He threw him&s;elf upon a &s;eat which &s;tood near him, and abandoned him&s;elf to the delu&s;ions of his fancy. He thought of his union with Antonia; he thought of the ob&s;tacles which might oppo&s;e his wi&s;hes; and a thou&s;and changing vi&s;ions floated be|fore his fancy, &s;ad 'tis true, but not unplea&s;ing. Sleep in&s;en&s;ibly &s;tole over him, and the tranquil &s;olemnity of his mind when awake, for a while continued to influence his &s;lumbers.</P>
<P>He &s;till fancied him&s;elf to be in the church of the Capuchins; but it was no longer dark and &s;olitary. Multitudes of &s;ilver lamps &s;hed &s;plendor from the vaulted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ofs; accompanied by the captivating chaunt of di&s;tant chori&s;ters, the organ's melody &s;welled

through the church; the altar &s;eemed decorated as for &s;ome di&s;tingui&s;hed fea&s;t; it was &s;urrounded by a brilliant company; and near it &s;tood Antonia array|ed in bridal white, and blu&s;hing with all the charms of virgin mode&s;ty.</P>
<P>Half hoping, half fearing, Lorenzo gazed upon the &s;cene before him. Suddenly, the door leading to the abbey unclo&s;ed; and he &s;aw, attended by a long trai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of monks, the preacher advance to whom he had ju&s;t li&s;tened with &s;o much admiration. He drew near Antonia.</P>
<P>"And where is the bridegroom?" &s;aid the imag|inary friar.</P>
<P>Antonia &s;eemed to look round the church with anx|iety. Involuntarily the youth advanced a few &s;teps from his concealment. She &s;aw him; the blu&s;h of plea&s;ure glowed upon her cheek; with a graceful motion of her hand &s;he beckoned to him to advance. He di&s;obeyed not the command; he flew towards her, and threw him&s;elf at her feet.</P>
<P>She retreated for a moment; then gazing upon him with evident delight, "Yes," &s;he exclaimed, "my bridegroom! my de&s;tined bridegroom!"</P>
<P>She &s;aid, and ha&s;tened to throw her&s;elf into his arms; but before he had time to receive her, an un|known ru&s;hed between them: his form was gigantic; his complexion was &s;warthy, his eyes fierce and terri|ble; his mouth breathed out volumes of fire, and on his forehead was written in legible characters&mdash;"Pride! Inhumanity!"</P>
<P>Antonia &s;hrieked. The mon&s;ter cla&s;ped her in his arms, and, &s;pringing with her upon the altar, tortur|ed
<PB N="34" REF="035729_0032_1006580157A0DFB8">
her with his odious care&s;&s;es. She endeavoured in vain to e&s;cape from his embrace. Lorenzo flew to her &s;uccour; but ere he had time to reach her, a loud bur&s;t of thunder was heard. In&s;tantly the cathedral &s;eemed crumbling into pieces; the monks betook them&s;elves to flight, &s;hrieking fearfully; the lamps were extin|gui&s;hed, the altar &s;unk down, and in its place appear|ed an aby&s;s vomiting forth clouds of flame. Utter|ing a loud and terrible cry, the mon&s;ter plunged into the gulph, and in his fall attempted to drag Antonia with him. He &s;trove in vain. Animated by &s;uper|natural powers, &s;he di&s;engaged her&s;elf from his em|braces; but her white robe was left in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. In&s;tantly, a wing of brilliant &s;plendor &s;pread it&s;elf from either of Antonia's arms. She darted upwards, and while a&s;cending, cried to Lorenzo, "Friend! we &s;hall meet above<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lovelace dreams, that Clari&s;&s;a left her robe in his gra&s;p.</NOTE>!"</P>
<P>At the &s;ame moment the roof of the cathedral op|ened; harmonious voices pealed along the vaults; and the glory into which Antonia was received, was com|po&s;ed of rays of &s;uch dazzling brightne&s;s, that Lorenzo was unable to &s;u&s;tain the gaze. His &s;ight failed, and he &s;unk upon the ground.</P>
<P>When he awoke, he found him&s;elf extended upon the pavement of the church: it was illuminated, and the chaunt of hymns &s;ounded from a di&s;tance. For a while, Lorenzo could not per&s;uade him&s;elf that what he had ju&s;t witne&s;&s;ed had been a dream, &s;o &s;trong an impre&s;&s;ion had it made upon his fancy. A little recollection convinced him of its fallacy: the lamps had been lighted during his &s;leep, and the mu|&s;ic which he heard was occa&s;ioned by the monks,
<PB N="35" REF="035729_0033_100657CB48454388">
who were celebrating their ve&s;pers in the abbey-chapel.</P>
<P>Lorenzo ro&s;e, and prepared to bend his &s;teps to|wards his &s;i&s;ter's convent, his mind fully occupied by the &s;ingularity of his dream. He already drew near the porch, when his attention was attracted by perceiving a &s;hadow moving upon the oppo&s;ite wall. He looked curiou&s;ly round, and &s;oon de&s;cried a man wrapped up in his cloak, who &s;eemed carefully exam|ining whether his actions were ob&s;erved. Very few people are exempt from the influence of curio&s;ity. The unknown &s;eemed anxious to conceal his bu&s;ine&s;s in the cathedral; and it was this very circum&s;tance which made Lorenzo wi&s;h to di&s;cover what he was about.</P>
<P>Our hero was con&s;cious that he had no right to pry into the &s;ecrets of this unknown cavalier.</P>
<P>"I will go," &s;aid Lorenzo. And Lorenzo &s;tayed where he was.</P>
<P>The &s;hadow thrown by the column effectually con|cealed him from the &s;tranger, who continued to ad|vance with caution.</P>
<P>At length he drew a letter from beneath his cloak, and ha&s;tily placed it beneath a colo&s;&s;al &s;tatue of Saint Francis. Then retiring with precipitation, he con|cealed him&s;elf in a part of the church at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from that in which the image &s;tood.</P>
<P>"So!" &s;aid Lorenzo to him&s;elf; "this is only &s;ome fooli&s;h love affair. I believe, I may as well be gone, for I can do no good in it."</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="035729_0034_10065804021BA858">
In truth, till that moment it never came into his head that he could do any good in it; but he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to make &s;ome little excu&s;e to him&s;elf for having indulged his curio&s;ity. He now made a &s;econd attempt to retire from the church. For this time he gained the porch without meeting with any impedi|ment; but it was de&s;tined that he &s;hould pay it an|other vi&s;it that night. As he de&s;cended the &s;teps lead|ing into the &s;treet, a cavalier ru&s;hed again&s;t him with &s;uch violence, that both were nearly overturned by the concu&s;&s;ion. Lorenzo put his hand to his &s;word.</P>
<P>"How now, Segnor?" &s;aid he; "what mean you by this rudene&s;s?"</P>
<P>"Ha! is it you, Medina?" replied the new comer, whom Lorenzo by his voice now recogni&s;ed for Don Chri&s;toval. "You are the luckie&s;t fellow in the uni|ver&s;e, not to have left the church before my return. In, in! my dear lad! they will be here immediately!"</P>
<P>"Who will be here?"</P>
<P>"The old hen and all her pretty little chickens. In, I &s;ay; and then you &s;hall know the whole hi&s;tory."</P>
<P>Lorenzo followed him into the cathedral, and they concealed them&s;elves behind the &s;tatue of St. Francis.</P>
<P>"And now," &s;aid our hero, "may I take the lib|erty of a&s;king what is the meaning of all this ha&s;te and rapture?"</P>
<P>"Oh! Lorenzo, we &s;hall &s;ee &s;uch a glorious &s;ight! The priore&s;s of St. Clare and her whole train of nuns are coming hither. You are to know that the pious father Ambro&s;io (the Lord reward him for it!) will

upon no account move out of his own precincts. It being ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for every fa&s;hionable con|vent to have him for its confe&s;&s;or, the nuns are in con|&s;equence obliged to vi&s;it him at the abbey; &s;ince, when the mountain will not come to Mahomet, Ma|homet mu&s;t needs go to the mountain. Now the pri|ore&s;s of St. Clare, the better to e&s;cape the gaze of &s;uch impure eyes as belong to your&s;elf and your humble &s;ervant, thinks proper to bring her holy flock to con|fe&s;&s;ion in the du&s;k: &s;he is to be admitted into the ab|bey-chapel by yon private door. The portere&s;s of St. Clare, who is a worthy old &s;oul and a particular friend of mine, has ju&s;t a&s;&s;ured me of their being here in a few moments. There is news for you, you rogue! We &s;hall &s;ee &s;ome of the prettie&s;t faces in Madrid!"</P>
<P>"In truth, Chri&s;toval, we &s;hall do no &s;uch thing. The nuns are always veiled."</P>
<P>"No, no! I know better. On entering a place of wor&s;hip, they ever take off their veils, from re&s;pect to the &s;aint to whom 'tis dedicated. But hark, they are coming! Silence! &s;ilence! ob&s;erve and be convinced."</P>
<P>"Good!" &s;aid Lorenzo to him&s;elf; "I may po&s;|&s;ibly di&s;cover to whom the vows are addre&s;&s;ed of this my&s;terious &s;tranger."</P>
<P>Scarcely had Don Chri&s;toval cea&s;ed to &s;peak, when the domina of St. Clare appeared, followed by a long proce&s;&s;ion of nuns. Each upon entering the church took off her veil. The priore&s;s cro&s;&s;ed her hands upon her bo&s;om, and made a profound reverence as &s;he pa&s;&s;|ed the &s;tatue of St. Francis, the patron of this cathe|dral. The nuns followed her example, and &s;everal moved onwards without having &s;atisfied Lorenzo's cu|rio&s;ity.
<PB N="38" REF="035729_0036_100658058A22CD88">
He almo&s;t began to de&s;pair of &s;eeing the my&s;|tery cleared up, when, in paying her re&s;pects to St. Francis, one of the nuns happened to drop her ro&s;ary. As &s;he &s;tooped to pick it up, the light fla&s;hed full in her face. At the &s;ame moment &s;he dexterou&s;ly re|moved the letter from beneath the image, placed it in her bo&s;om, and ha&s;tened to re&s;ume her rank in the proce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>"Ha!" &s;aid Chri&s;toval in a low voice, "here we have &s;ome little intrigue, no doubt."</P>
<P>"Agnes, by heaven!" cried Lorenzo.</P>
<P>"What, your &s;i&s;ter? Diavolo! Then &s;ome body, I &s;uppo&s;e, will have to pay for our peeping."</P>
<P>"And &s;hall pay for it without delay," replied the incen&s;ed brother.</P>
<P>The pious proce&s;&s;ion had now entered the abbey; the door was already clo&s;ed upon it. The unknown immediately quitted his concealment, and ha&s;tened to leave the church: ere he could effect his intention, he de&s;cried Medina &s;tationed in his pa&s;&s;age. The &s;tran|ger ha&s;tily retreated, and drew his hat over his eyes.</P>
<P>"Attempt not to fly me?" exclaimed Lorenzo; "I will know who you are, and w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">at were the con|tents of that letter."</P>
<P>"Of that letter?" repeated the unknown. "And by what title do you a&s;k the que&s;tion?"</P>
<P>"By a title of which I am now a&s;hamed; but it becomes not you to que&s;tion me. Either reply circum|&s;tantially to my demands, or an&s;wer me with your &s;word."</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="035729_0037_100657D225BF4CB0">
"The latter method will be the &s;horte&s;t," rejoined the other, drawing his rapier;" "come on, Segnor Bravo! I am ready."</P>
<P>Burning with rage, Lorenzo ha&s;tened to the attack: the antagoni&s;ts had already exchanged &s;everal pa&s;&s;es, before Chri&s;toval, who at that moment had more &s;en&s;e than either of them, could throw him&s;elf between their weapons.</P>
<P>"Hold! hold! Medina!" he exclaimed; remem|ber the con&s;equences of &s;hedding blood on con&s;ecrated ground!"</P>
<P>The &s;tranger immediately dropped his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">word.</P>
<P>"Medina?" he cried. "Great God, is it po&s;&s;ible! Lorenzo, have you quite forgotten Raymond de las Ci&s;ternas?"</P>
<P>Lorenzo's a&s;toni&s;hment increa&s;ed with every &s;uc|ceeding moment. Raymond advanced towards him; but with a look of &s;u&s;picion he drew back his hand, which the other was preparing to take.</P>
<P>"You here, marquis? what is the meaning of all this? you engaged in a clande&s;tine corre&s;pondence with my &s;i&s;ter, who&s;e affections&mdash;"</P>

<P>"Exactly &s;o, marquis."</P>

"I have no objection to entru&s;ting you with my &s;e|cret, for I am &s;ure that I may depend upon your &s;i|lence."</P>
<P>"Then your opinion of me is better than my own, and therefore I mu&s;t beg leave to decline your confi|dence. Do you go your own way, and I &s;hall go mine. Marquis, where are you to be found?"</P>
<P>"As u&s;ual, at the hotel de las Ci&s;ternas; but re|member that I am incognito, and that, if you wi&s;h to &s;ee me, you mu&s;t a&s;k for Alphon&s;o d'Alvarada."</P>
<P>"Good! good! Farewell cavaliers!" &s;aid Don Chri&s;toval, and in&s;tantly departed.</P>
<P>"You, marquis," &s;aid Lorenzo in the accent of &s;ur|pri&s;e; "You, Alphon&s;o d'Alvarada!"</P>
<P>"Even &s;o, Lorenzo: but unle&s;s you have already heard my &s;tory from your &s;i&s;ter, I have much to relate that will a&s;toni&s;h you. Follow me, therefore, to my hotel without delay."</P>
<P>At this moment the porter of the Capuchins entered the cathedral to lock up the doors for the night. The two noblemen in&s;tantly withdrew, and ha&s;tened with all &s;peed to the palace de las Ci&s;ternas.</P>

<P>Now Antonia had ob&s;erved the air with which Don Chri&s;toval had ki&s;&s;ed this &s;ame hand; but as &s;he drew conclu&s;ions from it &s;omewhat different from her aunt's, &s;he was wi&s;e enough to hold her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ongue.

<P>The old lady continued her di&s;cour&s;e to Antonia in the &s;ame &s;train, till they gained the &s;treet in which they lodged.

<P>The&s;e words were pronounced &s;o audibly that they reached the gip&s;y's ears. She immediately pierced through the crowd, and made towards the ladies. She &s;aluted them thrice in the ea&s;tern fa&s;hion, and then addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to Antonia.</P>

<P>The audience rang with laughter during the gip|&s;y's addre&s;s; and&mdash;"fifty-one&mdash;&s;quinting eyes&mdash;red hair&mdash;paint and patches,"&mdash;&amp;c. were bandied from mouth to mouth. Leonella was almo&s;t choaked with pa&s;&s;ion, and loaded her malicious advi&s;er with the bittere&s;t reproaches. The &s;warthy prophete&s;s for &s;ome time li&s;tened to her with a contemptuous &s;mile: at length &s;he made her a &s;hort an&s;wer, and then turned to Antonia.</P>

<P>THE monks having attended their abbot to the door of his cell, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them with an air of con&s;cious &s;uperiority, in which humility's &s;em|blance combated with the reality of pride.</P>
<P>He was no &s;ooner alone, than he gave free loo&s;e to the indulgence of his vanity. When he remembered the enthu&s;ia&s;m which his di&s;cour&s;e had excited, his heart &s;welled with rapture, and his imagination pre|&s;ented him with &s;plendid vi&s;ions of aggrandizement. He looked round him with exultation; and pride told him loudly, that he was &s;uperior to the re&s;t of his fel|low creatures.</P>
<P>"Who," thought he, "who but my&s;elf has pa&s;&s;ed the ordeal of youth, yet &s;ees no &s;ingle &s;tain upon his con&s;cience? Who el&s;e has &s;ubdued the violence of &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions and an impetuous temperament, and &s;ubmitted even from the dawn of life to voluntary re|tirement? I &s;eek for &s;uch a man in vain. I &s;ee no one but my&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch re&s;olution. Religion cannot boa&s;t Ambro&s;to's equal! How powerful an effect did my di&s;cour&s;e produce upon its auditors!
<PB N="47" REF="035729_0045_100657DE98A87830">

How they crouded round me! How they loaded me with benedictions, and pronounced me the &s;ole un|corrupted pillar of the church! What then now is left for me to do? Nothing, but to watch as carefully over the conduct of my brethren, as I have hitherto watched over my own. Yet hold! May I not be tempted from tho&s;e paths, which till now I have pur|&s;ued without one moment's wandering? Am I not a man, who&s;e nature is frail and prone to error? I mu&s;t now abandon the &s;olitude of my retreat; the faire&s;t and noble&s;t dames of Madrid continually pre|&s;ent them&s;elves at the abbey, and will u&s;e no other confe&s;&s;or. I mu&s;t accu&s;tom my eyes to objects of temptation, and expo&s;e my&s;elf to the &s;eduction of luxury and de&s;ire. Should I meet, in that world which I am con&s;trained to enter, &s;ome lovely female&mdash;lovely as yon Madona&mdash;!"</P>
<P>As he &s;aid this, he fixed his eyes upon a picture of the virgin, which was &s;u&s;pended oppo&s;ite to him: this for two years had been the object of his increa&s;ing wonder and adoration. He pau&s;ed, and gazed upon it with delight.</P>
<P>"What beauty in that countenance!" he continued, after a &s;ilence of &s;ome minutes; "how graceful is the turn of that head! what &s;weetne&s;s, yet what ma|je&s;ty in her divine eyes! how &s;oftly her cheek reclines upon her hand! Can the ro&s;e vie with the blu&s;h of that cheek? can the lily rival the whitene&s;s of that hand? Oh! if &s;uch a creature exi&s;ted, and exi&s;ted but for me! were I permitted to twine round my fingers tho&s;e golden ringlets, and pre&s;s to my lips that hand of &s;now! gracious God, &s;hould I then re&s;i&s;t the

temptation? Should I not barter for a &s;ingle em|brace the reward of my &s;ufferings for thirty years? Should I not abandon&mdash;Fool that I am! Whither do I &s;uffer my admiration of this picture to hurry me? Away, impure ideas! Let me remember, that wom|an is for ever lo&s;t to me. Never was mortal form|ed &s;o perfect as this picture. But even did &s;uch exi&s;t, the trial might be too mighty for common virtue: but Ambro&s;io's is proof again&s;t temptation. Temp|tation, did I &s;ay? To me it would be none. What charms me when ideal, and con&s;idered as a &s;uperior being, would di&s;gu&s;t me, becoming a woman and tainted with all the failings of mortality. It is not th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> woman's beauty that fills me with &s;uch enthu&s;i|a&s;m: it is the painter's &s;kill that I admire; it is the Divinity that I adore. Are not th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> pa&s;&s;ions dead in my bo&s;om? Have I not freed my&s;elf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">om the frailty of mankind? Fear not, Ambro&s;io! Take confidence in the &s;trength of thy virtue. Enter boldly into the world, to who&s;e failings you are &s;uperior; reflect that you are now exempted from humanity's defects, and defy all the arts of the &s;pirits of darkne&s;s. They &s;hall know you for what you are!"</P>
<P>Here his reverie was interrupted by three &s;oft knocks at the door of his cell. With difficulty did the abbot awake from his delirium. The knocking was repeated.</P>
<P>"Who is there?" &s;aid Ambro&s;io at length.</P>
<P>"It is only Ro&s;ario," replied a gentle voice.</P>
<P>"Enter! enter, my &s;on!"</P>
<P>The door was immediately opened, and Ro&s;ario appeared with a &s;mall ba&s;ket in his hand.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="035729_0047_100657E143D867D0">
Ro&s;ario was a young novice belonging to the mon|a&s;tery, who in three months intended to make it his profe&s;&s;ion. A &s;ort of my&s;tery enveloped this youth, which rendered him at once an object of intere&s;t and curio&s;ity. His hatred of &s;ociety, his profound melan|choly, his rigid ob&s;ervance of the duties of his order, and his voluntary &s;eclu&s;ion from the world, at his age &s;o unu&s;ual, attracted the notice of the whole frater|nity. He &s;eemed fearful of being recogni&s;ed, and no one had ever &s;een his face. His head was continu|ally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> up in his cowl; yet &s;uch of his features as accident di&s;covered, appeared the mo&s;t beautiful and noble. Ro&s;ario was the only name by which he was known in the mona&s;tery. No one knew from whence he came, and when que&s;tioned on the &s;ubject, he pre&s;erved a profound &s;ilence. A &s;tranger, who&s;e rich habit and magnificent equipage declared him to be of di&s;tingui&s;hed rank, had engaged the monks to receive a novice, and had depo&s;ited the nece&s;&s;ary &s;ums. The next day he returned with Ro&s;ario, and from that time no more had been heard of him.</P>
<P>The youth had carefully avoided the company of the monks: he an&s;wered their civilities with &s;weetne&s;s, but re&s;erve, and evidently &s;howed that his inclination led him to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">olitude. To this general rule the &s;uperior was the only exception. To him he looked up with a re&s;pect approaching idolatry: he &s;ought his com|pany with the mo&s;t attentive a&s;&s;iduity, and eagerly feized every means to ingratiate him&s;elf in his favour. In the abbot's &s;ociety his heart &s;eemed to be at ea&s;e, and an air of gaiety pervaded his whole manners and di&s;cour&s;e. Ambro&s;io on his &s;ide did not feel le&s;s at|tracted towards the youth; wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h him alone did he
<PB N="50" REF="035729_0048_1006580F93C6A710">
lay a&s;ide his habitual &s;everity. When he &s;poke to him, he in&s;en&s;ibly a&s;&s;umed a tone milder than was u&s;ual to him; and no voice &s;ounded &s;o &s;weet to him as did Ro&s;ario's. He repaid the youth's attentions by in&s;tructing him in various &s;ciences; the novice re|ceived his le&s;&s;ons with docility; Ambro&s;io was every day more charmed with the vivacity of his genius, the &s;implicity of his manners, and the rectitude of his heart: in &s;hort, he loved him with all the affection of a father. He could not help &s;ometimes &s;ecretly in|dulging a de&s;ire to &s;ee the face of his pupil; but his rule of &s;elf-denial extended even to curio&s;ity, and prevented him from communicating his wi&s;hes to the youth.</P>
<P>"Pardon my intru&s;ion, father," &s;aid Ro&s;ario, while he placed his ba&s;ket upon the table; "I come to you a &s;uppliant. Hearing that a dear friend is danger|ou&s;ly ill, I entreat your prayers for his recovery. If &s;upplications can prevail upon heaven to &s;pare him, &s;urely yours mu&s;t be efficacious."</P>
<P>"Whatever depends upon me, my &s;on, you know that you may command. What is your friend's name?"</P>
<P>"Vicentio della Ronda."</P>
<P>"'Tis &s;ufficient. I will not forget him in my pray|ers, and may our thrice-ble&s;&s;ed St. Francis deign to li&s;ten to my interce&s;&s;ion!&mdash;What have you in your ba&s;ket, Ro&s;ario?"</P>
<P>"A few of tho&s;e flowers, reverend father, which I have ob&s;erved to be mo&s;t acceptable to you. Will you permit my arranging them in your chamber?"</P>
<P>"Your attentions charm me, my &s;on."</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="035729_0049_1006584556F359D8">
While Ro&s;ario di&s;po&s;ed the contents of his ba&s;ket in &s;mall va&s;es, placed for that purpo&s;e in various parts of the room, the abbot thus continued the conver&s;ation:</P>
<P>"I &s;aw you not in the church this evening, Ro|&s;ario."</P>
<P>"Yet I was pre&s;ent, father. I am too grateful for your protection to lo&s;e any opportunity of witne&s;&s;|ing your triumph."</P>
<P>"Alas! Ro&s;ario, I have but little cau&s;e to tri|umph: the &s;aint &s;poke by my mouth; to him be|longs all the merit. It &s;eems then you were con|tented with my di&s;cour&s;e?"</P>
<P>"Contented, &s;ay you? Oh! you &s;urpa&s;&s;ed your|&s;elf! Never did I hear &s;uch eloquence&mdash;&s;ave once!"</P>
<P>Here the novice heaved an involuntary &s;igh.</P>
<P>"When was that once?" demanded the abbot.</P>
<P>"When you preached upon the &s;udden Indi&s;po&s;ition of our la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;uperior."</P>
<P>"I remember it: that is more than two years ago. And were you pre&s;ent? I knew you not at that time, Ro&s;ario."</P>
<P>"'Tis true, father; and would to God I had ex|pired ere I beheld that day! What &s;ufferings, what &s;orrows &s;hould I have e&s;caped!"</P>
<P>"Sufferings at your age, Ro&s;ario?"</P>
<P>"Aye, father; &s;ufferings, which, if known to you, would equally rai&s;e your anger and compa&s;&s;ion! &s;ufferings, which form at once the torment and plea&s;|ure
<PB N="52" REF="035729_0050_100658114ED83390">
of my exi&s;tence! Yet in this retreat my bo&s;om would feel tranquil, were it not for the tortures of ap|prehen&s;ion! Oh God! oh God! how cruel is a life of fear!&mdash;Father, I have given up all; I have aban|doned the world and its delights for ever: nothing now remains, nothing now has charms for me, but your friend&s;hip, but your affection. If I lo&s;e that, father! oh! if I lo&s;e that, tremble at the effects of my de&s;pair!"</P>
<P>"You apprehend the lo&s;s of my friend&s;hip? how has my conduct ju&s;tified this fear? know me better, Ro&s;ario, and think me worthy of your confidence. What are your &s;ufferings? Reveal them to me, and believe, that if 'tis in my power to relieve them&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Ah! 'tis in no one's power but your's. Yet I mu&s;t not let you know them. You would hate me for my avowal! you would drive me from your pre&s;|ence with &s;corn and ignominy."</P>
<P>"My &s;on, I conjure you! I entreat you&mdash;"</P>
<P>"For pity's &s;ake, inquire no further! I mu&s;t not&mdash;I dare not&mdash;Hark! the bell rings for ve&s;pers! Father, your benediction, and I leave you."</P>
<P>As he &s;aid this, he threw him&s;elf upon his knees, and received the ble&s;&s;ing which he demanded. Then pre&s;&s;ing the abbot's hand to his lips, he &s;tarted from the ground, and ha&s;tily quitted the apartment. Soon after Ambro&s;io de&s;cended to ve&s;pers (which were cel|ebrated in a &s;mall chapel belonging to the abbey) fill|ed with &s;urpri&s;e at the &s;ingularity of the youth's be|haviour.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="035729_0051_10083519A7DA7FD8">
Ve&s;pers being over, the monks retired to their re|&s;pective cells. The abbot alone remained in the chapel, to receive the nuns of St. Clare. He had not been long &s;eated in the confe&s;&s;ional chair, before the priore&s;s made her appearance. Each of the nuns was heard in her turn, while the others waited with the domina in the adjoining ve&s;try. Ambro&s;io li&s;t|ened to the confe&s;&s;ions with attention, made many ex|hortations&punc; enjoined penance proportioned to each of|fence, and for &s;ome time every thing went on as u&s;ual, till one of the nuns, con&s;picuous from the noblene&s;s of her air and elegance of her figure, carele&s;sly per|mitted a letter to fall from her bo&s;om. She was re|tiring uncon&s;cious of her lo&s;s. Ambro&s;io &s;uppo&s;ed it to have been written by &s;ome one of her relations, and took it up, intending to re&s;tore it to her."</P>
<P>"Stay, daughter," &s;aid he; "you have let fall&mdash;"</P>
<P>At this moment, the paper being already open, his eye involuntarily read the fir&s;t words. He &s;tarted back with &s;urpri&s;e. The nun had turned round on hearing his voice: &s;he perceived her letter in his hand, and uttering a &s;hriek of terror, flew ha&s;tily to regain it.</P>
<P>"Hold!" &s;aid the friar, in a tone of &s;everity; "daughter, I mu&s;t read this letter."</P>
<P>"Then I am lo&s;t!" &s;he exclaimed, cla&s;ping her hands together wildly.</P>
<P>All colour in&s;tantly faded from her face; &s;he trembled with agitation, and was obliged to fold her arms round a pillar of the chapel to &s;ave her&s;elf from &s;inking upon the floor. In the mean while the abbot read the following lines:</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="035729_0052_100658152EFA5630">
"All is ready for your e&s;cape, my deare&s;t Agnes! At twelve to-morrow night I &s;hall expect to find you at the garden-door: I have obtained the key, and a few hours will &s;uffice to place you in a &s;ecure a&s;ylum. Let no mi&s;taken &s;cruples induce you to reject the certain means of pre&s;erving your&s;elf and the innocent creature whom you nouri&s;h in your bo&s;om. Remem|ber that you had promi&s;ed to be mine, long ere you engaged your&s;elf to the church; that your &s;ituation will &s;oon be evident to the prying eyes of your com|panions; and that flight is the only means of avoid|ing the effects of their malevolent re&s;entment. Fare|well, my Agnes! my dear and de&s;tined wife! Fail not to be at the garden-door at twelve!"</P>
<P>"As &s;oon as he had fini&s;hed, Ambro&s;io bent an eye &s;tern and angry upon the imprudent nun.</P>
<P>"This letter mu&s;t to the priore&s;s," &s;aid he, and pa&s;&s;ed her.</P>
<P>His words &s;ounded like thunder to her ears: &s;he awoke from her torpidity only to be &s;en&s;ible of the dangers of her &s;ituation. She followed him ha&s;tily, and detained him by his garment.</P>
<P>"Stay! oh! &s;tay!" &s;he cried in the accents of de&s;pair, while &s;he threw her&s;elf at the friar's feet, and bathed them with her tears. "Father, compa&s;&s;ion|ate my youth!

We met nightly in the gardens of St. Clare, and in an unguarded moment I violated my vows of cha&s;tity. I &s;hall &s;oon become a mother.

If you di&s;cover my imprudence to the domina both of us are lo&s;t. The puni&s;hment which the laws of St. Clare a&s;&s;ign to unfortunates like my&s;elf, is mo&s;t &s;e|vere and cruel.

<P>The door of the ve&s;try opened, and the priore&s;s entered the chapel, followed by her nuns.</P>
<P>"Cruel, cruel!" exclaimed Agnes, relinqui&s;hing her hold.</P>
<P>Wild and de&s;perate, &s;he threw her&s;elf upon the ground, beating her bo&s;om, and rending her veil, in all the delirium of de&s;pair.

The friar now pre&s;ented the fatal paper to the priore&s;s, inform|ed her of the manner in which he had found it, and added, that it was her bu&s;ine&s;s to decide what penance the delinquent merited.</P>
<P>While &s;he peru&s;ed the letter, the domina's counte|nance grew inflamed with pa&s;&s;ion. What! &s;uch a

crime committed in her convent, and made known to Ambro&s;io, to the idol of Madrid, to the man whom &s;he was mo&s;t anxious to impre&s;s with an opinion of the &s;trictne&s;s and regularity of her hou&s;e! Words were inadequate to expre&s;s her fury. She was &s;ilent; and darted upon the pro&s;trate nun looks of menace and malignity.</P>
<P>"Away with her to the convent!" &s;aid &s;he at length, to &s;ome of her attendants.</P>
<P>Two of the olde&s;t nuns now approaching Agnes, rai&s;ed her forcibly from the ground, and prepared to conduct her from the chapel.</P>
<P>"What!" &s;he exclaimed &s;uddenly, &s;haking off their hold with di&s;tracted ge&s;tures, "is all hope then lo&s;t? Already do you drag me to puni&s;hment? where are you, Raymond? Oh! &s;ave me! &s;ave me!"&mdash;Then ca&s;ting upon the abbot a frantic look,</P>
<P>"Hear me!" &s;he continued, "man of an hard heart! Hear me, proud, &s;tern, and cruel! You could have &s;aved me; you could have re&s;tored me to happine&s;s and virtue, but would not: you are the de&s;troyer of my &s;oul; you are my murderer, and on you fall the cur&s;e of my death and my unborn infant's! In&s;olent in your yet un&s;haken virtue, you di&s;dained the prayers of a penitent, but God will &s;hew mercy, though you &s;hew none. And where is the merit of your boa&s;ted virtue? What temptations have you vanqui&s;hed? Coward! you have fled from it, not op|po&s;ed &s;eduction. But the day of trial will arrive. Oh! then when you yield to impetuous pa&s;&s;ions; when you feel that man is weak and born to err; when, &s;hudder|ing, you look back upon your crimes, and &s;olicit, with

terror, the mercy of your God, oh! in that fearful moment think upon me! think upon your cruelty! think upon Agnes, and de&s;pair of pardon."</P>
<P>As &s;he uttered the&s;e la&s;t words, her &s;trength was ex|hau&s;ted; and &s;he &s;unk inanimate upon the bo&s;om of a nun who &s;tood near her. She was immediately convey|ed from the chapel, and her companions followed her.</P>
<P>Ambro&s;io had not li&s;tened to her reproaches with|out emotion. A &s;ecret pang at his heart made him feel that he had treated this unfortunate with too great &s;everity. He therefore detained the priore&s;s, and ventured to pronounce &s;ome words in favour of the delinquent.</P>
<P>"The violence of her de&s;pair," &s;aid he, "proves that at lea&s;t vice is not become familiar to her. Per|haps, by treating her with &s;omewhat le&s;s rigour than is generally practi&s;ed, and mitigating in &s;ome degree the accu&s;tomed penance&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Mitigate it, father?" interrupted the lady prior|e&s;s: "Not I, believe me. The laws of our order are &s;trict and &s;evere; they have fallen into di&s;u&s;e of late: but the crime of Agnes &s;hews me the nece&s;&s;ity of their revival. I go to &s;ignify my intention to the convent, and Agnes &s;hall be the fir&s;t to feel the rigour of tho&s;e laws, which &s;hall be obeyed to the very let|ter. Father, farewell!"</P>
<P>Thus &s;aying, &s;he ha&s;tened out of the chapel.</P>
<P>"I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> my duty," &s;aid Ambro&s;io to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Still did he not feel perfectly &s;atisfied by this re|flection. To di&s;&s;ipate the unplea&s;ant ideas which this
<PB N="59" REF="035729_0057_1006584C54596960">
&s;cene had excited in him, upon quitting the chapel he de&s;cended into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> abbey <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. In all Madrid there was no &s;pot more beautiful, or better regulated. It was laid out with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite ta&s;te; the choice&s;t flowers adorned it in the height of luxuriance, and, though artfully arranged, &s;eemed only planted by the hand of Nature. Fountains, &s;pringing from ba|&s;ons of white marble, cooled the air with perpetual &s;howers; and the walls were entirely covered by je&s;&s;amines, vines, and honey &s;uckles. The hour now added to the beauty of the &s;cene. The full moon, ranging through a blue and cloudle&s;s &s;ky, &s;hed upon the trees a trembling lu&s;tre, and the waters of the fountains &s;parkled in the &s;ilver beam; a gentle breeze breathed the fragrance of orange blo&s;&s;oms along the alleys, and the nightingale poured forth her melodi|ous murmur from the &s;helter of an artificial wilder|ne&s;s. Thither the abbot bent his &s;teps.</P>
<P>In the bo&s;om of this little grove &s;tood a ru&s;tic grotto, formed in imitation of an hermitage. The walls were con&s;tructed of roots of trees, and the inter&s;tices filled up with mo&s;s and ivy. Seats of turf were placed on either <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">atural ca&s;cade fell from the rock above. Buried in him&s;elf, the monk ap|proached the &s;pot. The univer&s;al calm had communi|cated it&s;elf to his bo&s;om, and a voluptuous tranquillity &s;pread langour through his &s;oul.</P>
<P>He reached the hermitage, and was entering to re|po&s;e him&s;elf, when he &s;topped on perceiving it to be already occupied. Extended upon one of the banks, lay a man in a melancholy po&s;ture. His head was &s;upported upon his arm, and he &s;eemed lo&s;t in medita|tion. The monk drew nearer, and recogni&s;ed Ro&s;a|rio:
<PB N="60" REF="035729_0058_1006581A1184E0E8">
he watched him in &s;ilence, and entered not the hermitage. After &s;ome minutes the youth rai&s;ed his eyes, and fixed them mournfully upon the oppo&s;ite wall.</P>
<P>"Yes," &s;aid he, with a deep and plaintive &s;igh, "I feel all the happine&s;s of thy &s;ituation, all the mi&s;ery of my own. Happy were I could I think like thee! Could I look like thee with di&s;gu&s;t upon mankind, could bury my&s;elf for ever in &s;ome impenetrable &s;oli|tude, and forget that the world holds beings de&s;erving to be loved! Oh! what a ble&s;&s;ing would mi&s;anthropy be to me!"</P>
<P>"That is a &s;ingular thought, Ro&s;ario," &s;aid the abbot, entering the grotto.</P>
<P>"You here, reverend father?" cried the novice.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time &s;tarting from the mo&s;&s;y couch in confu&s;ion, he drew his cowl ha&s;tily over his face. Ambro&s;io placed him&s;elf upon the bank, and obliged the youth to be &s;eated by him.</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t not indulge this di&s;po&s;ition to melan|choly," &s;aid he&punc; "What can po&s;&s;ibly have made you view in &s;o de&s;irable a light, mi&s;anthropy, of all &s;enti|ments the mo&s;t hateful?"</P>
<P>"The peru&s;al of the&s;e ver&s;es, father, which till now had e&s;caped my ob&s;ervation. The brightne&s;s of the moon beams permitted my reading them; and, oh! how I envy the feelings of the writer!"</P>
<P>As he &s;aid this, he pointed to a marble tablet fixed again&s;t the oppo&s;ite wall, on it were engraved the following lines:</P>

<P>"Were it po&s;&s;ible," &s;aid the friar, "for man to be &s;o totally wrapped up in him&s;elf as to live in ab&s;olute &s;eclu&s;ion from human nature, and could yet feel the contented tranquillity which the&s;e lines expre&s;s, I al|low that the &s;ituation would be more de&s;irable, than to live in a world &s;o pregnant with every vice and every folly. But this never can be the ca&s;e. This in&s;cription was merely placed here for the ornament of the grotto, and the &s;entiments and the hermit are equally imaginary. Man was born for &s;ociety. How|ever little he may be attached to the world, he never can wholly forget it, or bear to be wholly forgotten by it. Di&s;gu&s;ted at the guilt or ab&s;urdity of mankind, the mi&s;anthrope flies from it; he re&s;olves to become an hermit, and buries him&s;elf in the cavern of &s;ome gloomy rock. While hate inflames his bo&s;om, po&s;|&s;ibly he may feel contented with his &s;ituation: but when his pa&s;&s;ions begin to cool; when Time has

mellowed his &s;orrows, and healed tho&s;e wounds which he bore with him to his &s;olitude, think you that Con|tent becomes his companion? Ah! no, Ro&s;ario. No longer &s;u&s;tained by the violence of his pa&s;&s;ions, he feels all the monotony of his way of living, and his heart becomes the prey of ennui and wearine&s;s. He looks round, and finds him&s;elf alone in the uni|ver&s;e: the love of &s;ociety revives in his bo&s;om, and he pants to return to that world which he has aban|doned. Nature lo&s;es all her charms in his eyes: no one is near him to point out her beauties, or &s;hare in his admiration of her excellence and variety. Prop|ped upon the fragment of &s;ome rock, he gazes upon the tumbling water fall with a vacant eye; he views without emotion the glory of the &s;etting &s;un. Slowly he returns to his cell at evening, for no one there is anxious for his arrival: he has no comfort in his &s;ol|itary, un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">avoury meal: he throws him&s;elf upon his couch of mo&s;s de&s;pondent and di&s;&s;atisfied, and wakes only to pa&s;s a day as joyle&s;s, as monotonous as the former."</P>
<P>"You amaze me, father! Suppo&s;e that circum|&s;tances condemned you to &s;olitude; would not the duties of religion, and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of a life well &s;pent, communicate to your heart that calm which&mdash;"</P>
<P>"I &s;hould deceive my&s;elf, did I fancy that they could. I am convinced of the contrary, and that all my fortitude would not prevent me from yielding to melancholy and di&s;gu&s;t.

After pa&s;&s;ing many a long hour in &s;olitude, if I could expre&s;s to you the joy which I feel at once more beholding a fellow creature! 'Tis
<PB N="64" REF="035729_0062_1006581F719D9190">
in this particular that I place the principal merit of a mona&s;tic in&s;titution. It &s;ecludes man from the temp|tations of vice; it procures that lei&s;ure nece&s;&s;ary for the proper &s;ervice of the Supreme; it &s;pares him the mortification of witne&s;&s;ing the crimes of the worldly, and yet permits him to enjoy the ble&s;&s;ings of &s;ociety. And do you, Ro&s;ario, do you envy an hermit's life? Can you be thus blind to the happine&s;s of your &s;itua|tion? Reflect upon it for a moment. This abbey is become your a&s;ylum: your regularity, your gentle|ne&s;s, your talents have rendered you the object of uni|ver&s;al e&s;teem: you are &s;ecluded from the world which you profe&s;s to hate; yet you remain in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the benefits of &s;ociety, and that a &s;ociety compo&s;ed of the mo&s;t e&s;timable of mankind."</P>
<P>"Father! father!" 'tis that which cau&s;es my torment. Happy had it been for me, had my life been pa&s;&s;ed among the vicious and abandoned; had I never heard pronounced the name of virtue. 'Tis my unbounded adoration of religion; 'tis my &s;oul's exqui&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">te &s;en&s;i|bility of the beauty of the fair and good, that loads me with &s;hame&mdash;that hurries me to perdition. Oh! that I had never &s;een the&s;e abbey walls!"</P>
<P>"How, Ro&s;ario? When we la&s;t conver&s;ed, you &s;poke in a different tone. Is my friend&s;hip then be|come of &s;uch little con&s;equence? Had you never &s;een the&s;e abbey walls, you never had &s;een me. Can that really be your wi&s;h?"</P>
<P>"Had never &s;een you? repeated the novice, &s;tart|ing from the bank, and gra&s;ping the friar's hand with a frantic air&mdash;"You! You! Would to heaven that lightning had bla&s;ted them before you ever met my

eyes! Would to heaven that I were never to &s;ee you more, and could forget that I had ever &s;een you!"</P>
<P>With the&s;e words he flew ha&s;tily from the grotto. Ambro&s;io remained in his former attitude, reflecting on the youth's unaccountable behaviour. He was in|clined to &s;u&s;pect the derangement of his &s;en&s;es: yet the general tenor of his conduct, the connection of his ideas, and calmne&s;s of his demeanor till the moment of his quitting the grotto, &s;eemed to di&s;countenance this conjecture. After a few minutes Ro&s;ario re|turned. He again &s;eated him&s;elf upon the bank: he reclined his cheek upon one hand, and with the other wiped away the tears which trickled from his eyes at intervals.</P>
<P>The monk looked upon him with compa&s;&s;ion, and forbore to interrupt his meditations. Both ob&s;erved for &s;ome time a profound &s;ilence. The nightingale had now taken her &s;tation upon an orange tree front|ing the hermitage, and poured forth a &s;train the mo&s;t melancholy and melodious. Ro&s;ario rai&s;ed his head, and li&s;tened to her with attention.</P>
<P>"It was thus," &s;aid he, with a deep drawn &s;igh, "it was thus that, during the la&s;t month of her unhappy life, my &s;i&s;ter u&s;ed to &s;it li&s;tening to the nightingale. Poor Matilda! &s;he &s;leeps in the grave, and her broken heart throbs no more with pa&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>"You had a &s;i&s;ter?"</P>
<P>"You &s;ay right, that I <HI>had.</HI> Alas! I have one no longer. She &s;unk beneath the weight of her &s;orrows in the very &s;pring of life."</P>

<P>"Father, before he knew her, Julian had already plighted his vows to a bride mo&s;t fair, mo&s;t heavenly! Yet &s;till my &s;i&s;ter loved, and for the hu&s;band's &s;ake &s;he doted upon the wife. One morning &s;he found means to e&s;cape from our father's hou&s;e: arrayed in humble weeds &s;he offered her&s;elf as a dome&s;tic to the con&s;ort of her beloved, and was accepted. She was now con|tinually in his pre&s;ence: &s;he &s;trove to ingratiate her|&s;elf into his favour: &s;he &s;ucceeded. Her attentions attracted Julian's notice: the virtuous are ever grate|ful, and he di&s;tingui&s;hed Matilda above the re&s;t of her companions."</P>
<P>"And did not your parents &s;eek for her? did they &s;ubmit tamely to their lo&s;s, nor attempt to recover their wandering daughter?"</P>
<P>"Ere they could find her, &s;he di&s;covered her&s;elf. Her love grew too violent for concealment; yet &s;he wi&s;hed not for Julian's per&s;on, &s;he ambitioned but a &s;hare of his heart. In an unguarded moment &s;he con|fe&s;&s;ed

her affection. What was the return? Doting upon his wife, and believing that a look of pity be|&s;towed upon another was a theft from what he owed to her, he drove Matilda from his pre&s;ence: he for|bade her ever again appearing before him. His &s;ever|ity broke her heart: &s;he returned to her father's, and in a few months after was carried to her grave."</P>
<P>"Unhappy girl! Surely her fate was too &s;evere, and Julian wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> too cruel."</P>
<P>"Do you think &s;o father?" cried the novice with vivacity: "Do you think that he was cruel?"</P>

<P>"You pity her? you pity her? Oh! father! father! then pity me&mdash;"</P>

Then lay a&s;ide your fears; &s;peak to me with openne&s;s; &s;peak to me, Ro&s;ario, and &s;ay that you will confide in me. If my aid or my pity can alleviate your di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Yours can; yours only can. Ah! father, how willingly would I unveil to you my heart! how wil|lingly would I declare the &s;ecret which bows me down with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> weight! But oh! I fear, I fear&mdash;"</P>
<P>"What, my &s;on?"</P>
<P>"That you &s;hould abhor me for my weakne&s;s; that the reward of my confidence &s;hould be the lo&s;s of your e&s;teem."</P>
<P>"How &s;hall I rea&s;&s;ure you? reflect upon the whole of my pa&s;t conduct, upon the paternal tender|ne&s;s which I have ever &s;hown you. Abhor you, Ro|&s;ario? It is no longer in my power.

<P>The abbot &s;tarted at this unexpected avowal. Pro&s;|trate on the ground lay the feigned Ro&s;ario, as if wait|ing in &s;ilence the deci&s;ion of his judge. A&s;toni&s;h|ment on the one part, apprehen&s;ion on the other, for &s;ome minutes chained them in the &s;ame attitudes, as had they been touched by the rod of &s;ome magician. At length recovering from his confu&s;ion, the monk quitted the grotto, and &s;ped with precipitation to|wards the abbey. His action did not e&s;cape the &s;up|pliant. She &s;prang from the ground; &s;he ha&s;tened to follow him, overtook him, threw her&s;elf in his pa&s;|&s;age, and embraced his knees.

<P>"Do not fly me!" &s;he cried. "Leave me not abandoned to the impul&s;e of de&s;pair! Li&s;ten, while I excu&s;e my imprudence; while I acknowledge my &s;i&s;ter's &s;tory to be my own! I am Matilda; you are her beloved."</P>

embarra&s;&s;ed, and irre&s;olute, he found him&s;elf incapable of pronouncing a &s;yllable, and remained in &s;ilence gazing upon Matilda. This gave her oppor|tunity to continue her explanation as follows:</P>
<P>"Think not, Ambro&s;io, that I come to rob your bride of your affections. No, believe me: Religion alone <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> you; and far is it from Matilda's wi&s;h to draw you from the paths of virtue.

<P>"I &s;pring from a di&s;tingui&s;hed family: my father was chief of the noble hou&s;e of Villanegas: he died while I was &s;till an infant, and left me &s;ole heire&s;s of his immen&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. Young and wealthy, I was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in marriage by the noble&s;t youths of Madrid; but no one &s;ucceeded in gaining my affections. I had been brought up under the care of an uncle po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the mo&s;t &s;olid judgment and exten&s;ive erudition&punc; he took plea&s;ure in communicating to me &s;ome portion of his knowledge. Under his in&s;tructions my under|&s;tanding acquired more &s;trength and ju&s;tne&s;s than gen|erally falls to the lot of my &s;ex: the ability of my preceptor being aided by natural curio&s;ity, I not only made a con&s;iderable progre&s;s in &s;ciences univer&s;ally &s;tudied, but in others revealed but to few, and lying under con&s;ure from the blindne&s;s of &s;uper&s;tition. But

while my guardian laboured to enlarge the &s;phere of my knowledge; he carefully inculcated every moral precept: he relieved me from the &s;hackles of vulgar prejudice: he pointed out the beauty of religion: he taught me to look with adoration upon the pure and virtuous; and, wo is me!

<P>"With &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions, judge whether I could ob&s;erve with any other &s;entiment than di&s;gu&s;t, the vice, di&s;&s;ipation, and ignorance which di&s;grace our Spani&s;h youth. I rejected every offer with di&s;dain: my heart remained without a ma&s;ter, till chance con|ducted me to the cathedral of the Capuchins. Then was it that I fir&s;t beheld you: you &s;upplied the &s;upe|rior's place, ab&s;ent from illne&s;s.&mdash;You cannot but re|member the lively enthu&s;ia&s;m which your di&s;cour&s;e created.

I &s;carcely dared to breathe, fearing to lo&s;e a &s;yllable; and while you &s;poke, methought a radiant glory beamed round your head, and your countenance &s;hone with the ma|je&s;ty of a God. I retired from the church, glowing with admiration. From that moment you became the idol of my heart; the never changing object of my meditations. I inquired re&s;pecting you. The re|ports which were made me of your mode of life, of your knowledge, piety, and &s;elf denial, riveted the chains impo&s;ed on me by your eloquence. I was con|&s;cious that there was no longer a void in my heart; that I had found the man whom I had &s;ought till then in vain. In expectation of hearing you again, every day I vi&s;ited your cathedral: you remained &s;ecluded within the abbey walls, and I always withdrew,

The night was more pro|pitious to me, for then you &s;tood before me in my dreams; you vowed to me eternal friend&s;hip; you led me through the paths of virtue, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted me to &s;upport the vexations of life. The morning di&s;|pelled the&s;e plea&s;ing vi&s;ions: I awoke and found my|&s;elf &s;eparated from you by barriers which appeared in|&s;urmountable. Time &s;eemed only to increa&s;e the &s;trength of my pa&s;&s;ion: I grew melancholy and de|&s;pondent; I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">led from &s;ociety, and my health declined daily. At length, no longer able to exi&s;t in this &s;tate of torture, I re&s;olved to a&s;&s;ume the di&s;gui&s;e in which you &s;ee me.

She cea&s;ed.&mdash;While &s;he &s;poke, a thou&s;and oppo&s;ing &s;entiments combated in Ambro&s;io's bo&s;om.

<P>By degrees he recovered from his confu&s;ion: his ideas became le&s;s bewildered: he was immediately &s;en&s;ible of the extreme impropriety, &s;hould Matilda be permitted to remain in the abbey after this avowal of her &s;ex. He a&s;&s;umed an air of &s;everity, and drew away his hand.</P>

<P>"You are determined, &s;o am I: the moment that you leave me, I plunge this &s;teel in my heart."</P>

<P>"I care not, I care not!" &s;he replied pa&s;&s;ionately: "either your hand guides me to paradi&s;e, or my own dooms me to perdition! Speak to me, Ambro&s;io! Tell me that you will conceal my &s;tory; that I &s;hall

<P>He found it impo&s;&s;ible for &s;ome time to arrange his ideas. The &s;cene in which he had been engaged, had excited &s;uch a variety of &s;entiments in his bo&s;om, that he was incapable of deciding which was predominant. He was irre&s;olute what conduct he ought to hold with the di&s;turber of his repo&s;e; he was con&s;cious that pru|dence, religion, and propriety, nece&s;&s;itated his obliging her to quit the abbey: but, on the other hand, &s;uch powerful rea&s;ons authorized her &s;tay, that he was but too much inclined to con&s;ent to her remaining. He could not avoid being flattered by Matilda's declara|tion, and at reflecting that he had uncon&s;ciou&s;ly van|qui&s;hed an heart which had re&s;i&s;ted the attacks of Spain's noble&s;t cavaliers. The manner in which he had gained her affections was al&s;o the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory to his vanity: he remembered the many happy hours which he had pa&s;&s;ed in Ro&s;ario's &s;ociety; and dreaded that void in his heart which parting with him would occa&s;ion. Be&s;ides all this, he con&s;idered, that, as Ma|tilda
<PB N="78" REF="035729_0076_1006582E2E038698">
was wealthy, her favour might be of e&s;&s;ential ben|efit to the abbey.</P>
<P>"And what do I ri&s;k," &s;aid he to him&s;elf, "by authorizing her &s;tay? may I not &s;afely credit her a&s;|&s;ertions? will it not be ea&s;y for me to forget her &s;ex, and &s;till con&s;ider her as my friend, and my di&s;ciple? Surely her love is as pure as &s;he de&s;cribes: had it been the offspring of mere licentiou&s;ne&s;s, would &s;he &s;o long have concealed it in her own bo&s;om? would &s;he not have employed &s;ome means to procure its grat|ification? &s;he has done quite the contrary: &s;he &s;trove to keep me in ignorance of her &s;ex; and nothing but the fear of detection, and my in&s;tances, would have compelled her to reveal the &s;ecret: &s;he has ob&s;erved the duties of religion not le&s;s &s;trictly than my&s;elf: &s;he has made no attempt to rou&s;e my &s;lumbering pa&s;&s;ions, nor has &s;he ever conver&s;ed with me till this night on the &s;ubject of love. Had &s;he been de&s;irous to gain my affections, not my e&s;teem, &s;he would not have concealed from me her charms &s;o carefully: at this very moment I have never &s;een her face; yet cer|tainly that face mu&s;t be lovely, and her per&s;on beauti|ful, to judge by what I have &s;een."</P>
<P>As this la&s;t idea pa&s;&s;ed through his imagination, a blu&s;h &s;pread it&s;elf over his cheek. Alarmed at the &s;entiments which he was indulging, he betook him&s;elf to prayer: he &s;tarted from his couch, knelt before the beautiful Madona, and entreated her a&s;&s;i&s;tance in &s;ti|fling &s;uch culpable emotions: he then returned to his bed, and re&s;igned him&s;elf to &s;lumber.</P>
<P>He awoke heated and unrefre&s;hed; and &s;tarted from his couch, heartily a&s;hamed when he reflected on
<PB N="79" REF="035729_0077_10065861F51297F8">
his rea&s;ons of the former night, which induced him to authorize Matilda's &s;tay. The cloud was now di&s;&s;i|pated which had ob&s;cured his judgment; he &s;hudder|ed when he beheld his arguments blazoned in their proper colours, and found that he had been a &s;lave to flattery, to avarice and &s;elf love. If in one hour's conver&s;ation Matilda had produced a change &s;o re|markable in his &s;entiments, what had he not to dread from her remaining in the abbey? Become &s;en&s;ible of his danger, awakened from his dream of confidence, he re&s;olved to in&s;i&s;t on her departing without delay: he began to feel that he was not proof again&s;t temp|tation; and that, however Matilda might re&s;train her&s;elf within the bounds of mode&s;ty, he was unable to contend with tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions from which he fal&s;ely thought him&s;elf exempted.</P>
<P>"Agnes! Agnes!" he exclaimed, while reflecting on his embarra&s;&s;ments, "I already feel thy cur&s;e!"</P>
<P>He quitted his cell, determined upon di&s;mi&s;&s;ing the feigned Ro&s;ario. He appeared at matins; but his thoughts were ab&s;ent, and he paid them but little at|tention: his heart and brain were both of them filled with worldly objects, and he prayed without devo|tion. The &s;ervice over, he de&s;cended into the garden; he bent his &s;teps towards the &s;ame &s;pot where on the preceding night he had made this embarra&s;&s;ing di&s;cov|ery: he doubted not that Matilda would &s;eek him there. He was not deceived: &s;he &s;oon entered the hermitage, and approached the monk with a timid air. After a few minutes, during which both were &s;ilent, &s;he appeared as if on the point of &s;peaking; but the abbot, who during this time had been &s;ummoning up

all his re&s;olution, ha&s;tily interrupted her. Though &s;till uncon&s;cious how exten&s;ive was its influence, he dreaded the melodious &s;eduction of her voice.</P>
<P>"Seat your&s;elf by my &s;ide, Matilda," &s;aid he, a&s;&s;um|ing a look of firmne&s;s, though carefully avoiding the lea&s;t mixture of &s;everity; "li&s;ten to me patiently, and believe that, in what I &s;hall &s;ay, I am not more influ|enced by my own intere&s;t than by yours; believe that I feel for you the warme&s;t friend&s;hip, the true&s;t com|pa&s;&s;ion; and that you cannot feel more grieved than I do, when I declare to you that we mu&s;t never meet again."</P>
<P>"Ambro&s;io!" &s;he cried, in a voice at once expre&s;|&s;ive both of &s;urpri&s;e and of &s;orrow.</P>
<P>"Be calm, my friend! my Ro&s;ario! &s;till let me call you by that name &s;o dear to me: our &s;eparation is unavoidable; I blu&s;h to own how &s;en&s;ibly it affects me,&mdash;But yet it mu&s;t be &s;o; I feel my&s;elf incapable of treating you with indifference; and that very convic|tion obliges me to in&s;i&s;t upon your departure.

<P>"Cruel! cruel!" &s;he exclaimed, wringing her hands in agony: "you know too well that you offer me no choice: you know too well that I can have no will but yours."</P>
<P>"I was not then deceived. Matilda's genero&s;ity equals my expectations."</P>
<P>"Yes: I will prove the truth of my affection by &s;ubmitting to a decree which cuts me to the very heart. Take back your promi&s;e. I will quit the mona&s;tery this very day.

<P>"What &s;hall I give you?"</P>
<P>"Something&mdash;any thing&mdash;one of tho&s;e flowers will be &s;ufficient." [Here &s;he pointed to a bu&s;h of ro&s;es,
<PB N="83" REF="035729_0081_10065866278BFE30">
planted at the door of the grotto.] "I will hide it in my bo&s;om, and, when I am dead, the nuns &s;hall find it withered upon my heart."</P>
<P>The friar was unable to reply: with &s;low &s;teps, and a &s;oul heavy wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> affliction, he quitted the her|mitage. He approached the bu&s;h, and &s;tooped to pluck one of the ro&s;es. Suddenly he uttered a pierc|ing cry, &s;tarted back ha&s;tily, and let the flower, which he already held, fall from his hand. Matilda heard the &s;hriek, and flew anxiou&s;ly towards him.</P>
<P>"What is the matter?" &s;he cried. "An&s;wer me, for God's &s;ake! What has happened?"</P>
<P>"I have received my death," he replied in a faint voice: "concealed among the ro&s;es&mdash;a &s;erpent&mdash;"</P>
<P>Here the pain of his wound became &s;o exqui&s;ite, that nature was unable to bear it: his &s;en&s;es aban|doned him, and he &s;unk inanimate into Matilda's arms.</P>
<P>Her di&s;tre&s;s was beyond the power of de&s;cription. She rent her hair, beat her bo&s;om, and, not daring to quit Ambro&s;io, endeavoured, by loud cries, to &s;um|mon the monks to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. She at length &s;uc|ceeded. Alarmed by her &s;hrieks, &s;everal of the broth|ers ha&s;tened to the &s;pot, and the &s;uperior was con|veyed back to the abbey. He was immediately put to bed, and the monk who officiated as &s;urgeon to the fraternity prepared to examine the wound. By this time Ambro&s;io's hand had &s;welled to an extraordinary &s;ize: the remedies which had been admini&s;tered to him, 'tis true, re&s;tored him to life, but not to his &s;en|&s;es: he raved in all the horrors of delirium, foamed
<PB N="84" REF="035729_0082_10065834044FB2E0">
at the mouth, and four of the &s;tronge&s;t monks were &s;carcely able to hold him in his bed.</P>
<P>Father Pablos (&s;uch was the &s;urgeon's name) ha&s;t|ened to examine the wounded hand. The monks &s;urrounded the bed, anxiou&s;ly waiting for the deci|&s;ion: among the&s;e the feigned Ro&s;ario appeared not the mo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible to the friar's calamity; he gazed upon the &s;ufferer with inexpre&s;&s;ible angui&s;h; and his groans, which every moment e&s;caped from his bo&s;om, &s;ufficiently betrayed the violence of his affliction.</P>
<P>Father Pablos probed the wound. As he drew out his in&s;trument, its point was tinged with a greeni&s;h hue. He &s;hook his head mournfully, and quitted the bed-&s;ide.</P>
<P>"'Tis as I feared," &s;aid he; "there is no hope."</P>
<P>"No hope!" exclaimed the monks with one voice; "&s;ay you, no hope?"</P>
<P>"From the &s;udden effects, I &s;u&s;pected that the ab|bot was &s;tung by a cientipedoro:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The cientipedoro is &s;uppo&s;ed to be a native of Cuba, and to have been brought into Spain, from that i&s;land, in the ve&s;&s;el of Columbus.</NOTE> the venom which you &s;ee upon my in&s;trument confirms my idea. He cannot live three days."</P>
<P>"And can no po&s;&s;ible remedy be found?" inquir|ed Ro&s;ario.</P>
<P>"Without extracting the poi&s;on, he cannot recov|er; and how to extract it, is to me &s;till a &s;ecret. All that I can do is to apply &s;uch herbs to the wound as
<PB N="85" REF="035729_0083_10065867CA271730">
will relieve the angui&s;h: the patient will be re&s;tored to his &s;en&s;es; but the venom will corrupt the whole ma&s;s of his blood, and in three days he will exi&s;t no longer."</P>
<P>Exce&s;&s;ive was the univer&s;al grief at hearing this de|ci&s;ion. Pablos, as he had promi&s;ed, dre&s;&s;ed the wound, and then retired, followed by his companions. Ro&s;a|rio alone remained in the cell; the abbot, at his ur|gent entreaty, having been committed to his care. Ambro&s;io's &s;trength worn out by the violence of his exertions, he had by this time fallen into a profound &s;leep. So totally was he overcome by wearine&s;s, that he &s;carcely gave any &s;igns of life. He was &s;till in this &s;ituation, when the monks returned to inquire whether any change had taken place. Pablos loo&s;|ened the bandage which concealed the wound, more from a principle of curio&s;ity, than from indulging the hope of di&s;covering any favourable &s;ymptoms. What was his a&s;toni&s;hment at finding that the inflammation had totally &s;ub&s;ided! He probed the hand; his in|&s;tument came out pure and un&s;ullied; no traces of the venom were perceptible; and had not the orifice &s;till been vi&s;ible, Pablos might have doubted that there had ever been a wound.</P>
<P>He communicated this intelligence to his brethren: their delight was only equalled by their &s;urpri&s;e. From the latter &s;entiment, however, they were &s;oon relea&s;ed, by explaining the circum&s;tance according to their own ideas. They were perfectly convinced that their &s;uperior was a &s;aint, and thought that noth|ing could be more natural than for St. Francis to have operated a miracle in his favour. This opinion
<PB N="86" REF="035729_0084_10065836F53A6F30">
was adopted unanimou&s;ly. They declared it &s;o loudly, and vociferated "A miracle! a miracle!" with &s;uch fervour, that they &s;oon interrupted Ambro|&s;io's &s;lumbers.</P>
<P>The monks immediately crowded round his bed, and expre&s;&s;ed their &s;atisfaction at his wonderful recov|ery. He was perfectly in his &s;en&s;es, and free from every complaint, except feeling weak and languid. Pablos gave him a &s;trengthening medicine, and advi&s;|ed his keeping his bed for the two &s;ucceeding days: he then retired, having de&s;ired his patient not to ex|hau&s;t him&s;elf by conver&s;ation, but rather to endeav|our at taking &s;ome repo&s;e. The other monks fol|lowed his example, and the abbot and Ro&s;ario were left without ob&s;ervers.</P>
<P>For &s;ome minutes Ambro&s;io regarded his attendant with a look of mingled plea&s;ure and apprehen&s;ion. She was &s;eated upon the &s;ide of the bed, her head bending down, and, as u&s;ual, enveloped in the cowl of her habit.</P>
<P>"And you are &s;till here, Matilda?" &s;aid the friar at length; "are you not &s;atisfied with having &s;o nearly effected my de&s;truction, that nothing but a miracle could have &s;aved me from the grave? Ah! &s;urely heaven &s;ent that &s;erpent to puni&s;h&mdash;"</P>
<P>Matilda interrupted him by putting her hand before his lips with an air of gaiety.</P>
<P>"Hu&s;h; father, hu&s;h! you mu&s;t not talk."</P>
<P>"He who impo&s;ed that order, knew not how in|tere&s;ting are the &s;ubjects on which I wi&s;h to &s;peak."</P>

"But I know it, and yet i&s;&s;ue the &s;ame po&s;itive command. I am appointed your nur&s;e, and you mu&s;t not di&s;obey my orders."</P>
<P>"You are in &s;pirits, Matilda."</P>
<P>"Well may I be &s;o: I have ju&s;t received a plea&s;|ure unexampled through my whole life."</P>
<P>"What was that plea&s;ure?"</P>
<P>"What I mu&s;t conceal from all, but mo&s;t from you."</P>
<P>"But mo&s;t from me? Nay then, I entreat you, Matilda&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Hu&s;h! father, hu&s;h! you mu&s;t not talk. But as you do not &s;eem inclined to &s;leep, &s;hall I endeavour to amu&s;e you with my harp?"</P>
<P>"How! I knew not that you under&s;tood mu&s;ic."</P>
<P>"Oh! I am a &s;orry performer! Yet as &s;ilence is pre&s;cribed you for eight and forty hours, I may po&s;&s;ibly entertain you when wearied of your own reflections. I go to fetch my harp."</P>
<P>She &s;oon returned with it.</P>
<P>"Now, father, what &s;hall I &s;ing? Will you hear the ballad which treats of the gallant Durandarte, who died in the famous battle of Roncevalles?"</P>
<P>"What you plea&s;e, Matilda."</P>
<P>"Oh! call me not Matilda! call me Ro&s;ario, call me your friend. Tho&s;e are the names which I love to hear from your lips. Now li&s;ten."</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="035729_0086_10065839A6F39E60">
She then tuned her harp, and afterwards preluded for &s;ome moments with &s;uch exqui&s;ite ta&s;te as to prove her a perfect mi&s;tre&s;s of the in&s;trument. The air which &s;he played was &s;oft and plaintive. Am|bro&s;io, while he li&s;tened, felt his unea&s;ine&s;s &s;ub&s;ide, and a plea&s;ing melancholy &s;pread it&s;elf into his bo&s;om. Suddenly Matilda changed the &s;train: with an hand bold and rapid, &s;he &s;truck a few loud martial chords, and then chanted the following ballad to an air at once &s;imple and melodious:</P>

<P>While &s;he &s;ang, Ambro&s;io li&s;tened with delight: never had he heard a voice more harmonious; and he wondered how &s;uch heavenly &s;ounds could be pro|duced by any but angels. But though he indulged the &s;en&s;e of hearing, a &s;ingle look convinced him, that he mu&s;t not tru&s;t to that of &s;ight. The &s;ong&s;tre&s;s &s;at at a little di&s;tance from his bed. The attitude in which &s;he bent over her harp was ea&s;y and graceful: her cowl had fallen more back than u&s;ual: two coral lips were vi&s;ible, ripe, fre&s;h, and melting, and a chin, in who&s;e dimples &s;eemed to lurk a thou&s;and Cupids. Her habit's long &s;leeve would have &s;wept along the chords of the in&s;trument: to prevent this inconve|nience &s;he had drawn it above her elbow; and by this means an arm was di&s;covered, formed in the mo&s;t per|fect &s;ymmetry, the delicacy of who&s;e &s;kin might have contended with &s;now in whitene&s;s. Ambro&s;io dared to look on her but once: that glance &s;ufficed to con|vince him how dangerous was the pre&s;ence of this &s;e|ducing

There &s;he &s;till mov|ed before him, adorned with all tho&s;e charms which his heated imagination could &s;upply.

<P>Matilda cea&s;ed to &s;ing.

<P>As &s;he &s;aid this, her voice was choked by weeping. While &s;he bent over Ambro&s;io, a tear fell upon his cheek.</P>

<P>Her alarm was ungrounded. None &s;leep &s;o pro|foundly as tho&s;e who are determined not to wake.

<P>"What affection! what purity!" &s;aid he inter|nally. "Ah! &s;ince my bo&s;om is thus &s;en&s;ible of pity, what would it be if agitated by love?"</P>
<P>Matilda again quitted her &s;eat, and retired to &s;ome di&s;tance from the bed. Ambro&s;io ventured to open his eyes, and to ca&s;t them upon her fearfully. Her face was turned from him.

Perhaps he may yet acknowledge that he feels for me more than pity, and that affection like mine might well have de&s;erved a return. Perhaps he may own thus much when I lie on my death bed. He then need not fear to infringe his vows, and the confe&s;&s;ion of his regard will &s;often the pangs of dying. Would I were &s;ure of this! oh! how earne&s;tly &s;hould I &s;igh for the moment of di&s;|&s;olution!"</P>
<P>Of this di&s;cour&s;e the abbot lo&s;t not a &s;yllable! and the tone in which &s;he pronounced the&s;e la&s;t words
<PB N="94" REF="035729_0092_10065840911949F0">
pierced to his heart. Involuntarily he rai&s;ed him&s;elf from his pillow.</P>
<P>"Matilda!" he &s;aid in a troubled voice; "Oh! my Matilda!"</P>
<P>She &s;tarted at the &s;ound, and turned towards him ha&s;tily. The &s;uddenne&s;s of her movement made her cowl fall back from her head; her features became vi&s;ible to the monk's inquiring eye. What was his amazement at beholding the exact re&s;emblance of his admired Madona! The &s;ame exqui&s;ite propor|tion of features, the &s;ame profu&s;ion of golden hair, the &s;ame ro&s;y lips, heavenly eyes, and maje&s;ty of countenance adorned Matilda! Uttering an exclama|tion of &s;urpri&s;e, Ambro&s;io &s;unk back upon his pillow, and doubted whether the object before him was mor|tal or divine.</P>
<P>Matilda &s;eemed penetrated with confu&s;ion. She remained motionle&s;s in her place, and &s;upported her|&s;elf upon her in&s;trument. Her eyes were bent upon the earth, and her fair cheeks over&s;pread with blu&s;hes. On recovering her&s;elf, her fir&s;t action was to conceal her features. She then, in an un&s;teady and troubled voice, ventured to addre&s;s the&s;e words to the friar:</P>
<P>"Accident has made you ma&s;ter of a &s;ecret which I never would have revealed but on the bed of death: yes, Ambro&s;io, in Matilda de Villanegas you &s;ee the original of your beloved Madona. Soon after I con|ceived my unfortunate pa&s;&s;ion, I formed the project of conveying to you my picture. Crowds of admir|ers had per&s;uaded me that I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome beauty, and I was anxious to know what effect it would pro|duce upon you. I cau&s;ed my portrait to be drawn by
<PB N="95" REF="035729_0093_100658707010A830">
Martin Galuppi, a celebrated Venetian, at that time re&s;ident in Madrid. The re&s;emblance was &s;triking: I &s;ent it to the Capuchin abbey as if for &s;ale; and the Jew from whom you bought it was one of my emi&s;&s;aries. You purcha&s;ed it. Judge of my rapture, when informed that you had gazed upon it with de|light, or rather with adoration; that you had &s;u&s;|pended it in your cell, and that you addre&s;&s;ed your &s;upplications to no other &s;aint! Will this di&s;cov|ery make me &s;till more regarded as an object of &s;u&s;picion? Rather &s;hould it convince you how pure is my affection, and engage you to &s;uffer me in your &s;ociety and e&s;teem. I heard you daily choral the prai&s;|es of my portrait. I was an eye witne&s;s of the tran&s;|ports which its beauty excited in you: yet I forebore to u&s;e again&s;t your virtue tho&s;e arms with which your&s;elf had furni&s;hed me. I concealed tho&s;e features from your fight, which you loved uncon&s;ciou&s;ly. I &s;trove not to excite de&s;ire by di&s;playing my charms, or to make my&s;elf mi&s;tre&s;s of your heart through the me|dium of your &s;en&s;es. To attract your notice by &s;tu|diou&s;ly attending to religious duties, to endear my&s;elf to you by convincing you that my mind was virtuous, and my attachment &s;incere, &s;uch was my only aim. I &s;ucceeded; I became your companion and your friend. I concealed my &s;ex from your knowledge; and, had you not pre&s;&s;ed me to reveal my &s;ecret, had I not been tormented by the fear of a di&s;covery, never had you known me for any other than Ro&s;ario. And &s;till are you re&s;olved to drive me from you? The few hours of life which yet remain for me, may I not pa&s;s them in your pre&s;ence? Oh! &s;peak, Ambro&s;io, and tell me that I may &s;tay."</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="035729_0094_1006584218E6B9B0">
This &s;peech gave the abbot an opportunity of recol|lecting him&s;elf. He was con&s;cious that, in the pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition of his mind, avoiding her &s;ociety was his only refuge from the power of this enchanting woman.</P>
<P>"Your declaration has &s;o much a&s;toni&s;hed me," &s;aid he, "that I am at pre&s;ent incapable of an&s;wering you. Do not in&s;i&s;t upon a reply, Matilda; leave me to my&s;elf, I have need to be alone."</P>
<P>"I obey you; but, before I go, promi&s;e not to in|&s;i&s;t upon my quitting the abbey immediately."</P>
<P>"Matilda, reflect upon your &s;ituation; reflect upon the con&s;equences of your &s;tay: our &s;eparation is indi&s;|pen&s;able, and we mu&s;t part."</P>
<P>"But not to-day, father! Oh! in pity, not to-day!"</P>
<P>"You pre&s;s me too hard; but I cannot re&s;i&s;t that tone of &s;upplication. Since you in&s;i&s;t upon it, I yield to your prayer; I con&s;ent to your remaining here a &s;ufficient time to prepare, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the brethren for your departure: &s;tay yet two days; but on the third"&mdash;(He &s;ighed involuntarily)&mdash;"remem|ber, that on the third we mu&s;t part for ever!"</P>
<P>She caught his hand eagerly, and pre&s;&s;ed it to her lips.</P>
<P>"On the third!" &s;he exclaimed with an air of wild &s;olemnity: "You are right, father, you are right! On the third we mu&s;t part for ever!"</P>
<P>There was a dreadful expre&s;&s;ion in her eyes as &s;he uttered the&s;e words, which penetrated the friar's &s;oul
<PB N="97" REF="035729_0095_1006587447319550">
with horror. Again &s;he ki&s;&s;ed his hand, and then fled with rapidity from the chamber.</P>
<P>Anxious to authorize the pre&s;ence of his dangerous gue&s;t, yet con&s;cious that her &s;tay was infringing the laws of his order, Ambro&s;io's bo&s;om became the theatre of a thou&s;and contending pa&s;&s;ions. At length his attach|ment to the feigned Ro&s;ario &s;eemed likely to obtain the victory: the &s;ucce&s;s was a&s;&s;ured, when that pre|&s;umption which formed the ground work of his char|acter came to Matilda's a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The monk re|flected, that to vanqui&s;h temptation was an infinitely greater merit than to avoid it; he thought that he ought rather to rejoice in the opportunity given him of proving the firmne&s;s of his virtue. St. Anthony had with&s;tood all &s;eductions, then why &s;hould not he? Be|&s;ides, St. Anthony was tempted by Satan, who put every art into practice to excite his pa&s;&s;ions; whereas Ambro&s;io's danger proceeded from a mere mortal woman, fearful and mode&s;t, who&s;e apprehen&s;ions of his yielding were not le&s;s violent than his own.</P>
<P>"Yes," &s;aid he, "the unfortunate &s;hall &s;tay; I have nothing to fear from her pre&s;ence: even &s;hould my own prove too weak to re&s;i&s;t the temptation, I am &s;ecured from danger by the innocence of Matilda."</P>
<P>Ambro&s;io was yet to learn, that, to an heart unac|quainted with her, vice is ever mo&s;t dangerous when lurking behind the ma&s;k of virtue.</P>
<P>He found him&s;elf &s;o perfectly recovered, that when father Pablos vi&s;ited him again at night, he entreated permi&s;&s;ion to quit his chamber on the day following. His reque&s;t was granted. Matilda appeared no more
<PB N="98" REF="035729_0096_10065843C6E61918">
that evening, except in company with the monks when they came in a body to inquire after the abbot's health. She &s;eemed fearful of conver&s;ing with him in private, and &s;taid but a few minutes in his room. The friar &s;lept well.</P>
<P>The morning dawned, but he was not di&s;po&s;ed to quit his bed: he excu&s;ed him&s;elf from appearing at matins: it was the fir&s;t morning in his life that he had ever mi&s;&s;ed them. He ro&s;e late: during the whole of the day he had no opportunity of &s;peaking to Matilda without witne&s;&s;es; his cell was thronged by the monks, anxious to expre&s;s their concern at his illne&s;s; and he was &s;till occupied in receiving their compliments on his recovery, when the bell &s;ummoned them to the refectory.</P>
<P>After dinner, the monks &s;eparated, and di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves in various parts of the garden, where the &s;hade of trees, or retirement of &s;ome grotto, pre&s;ented the mo&s;t agreeable means of enjoying the &s;ie&s;ta. The abbot bent his &s;teps towards the hermitage; a glance of his eye invited Matilda to accompany him: &s;he obeyed, and followed him thither in &s;ilence; they en|tered the grotto, and &s;eated them&s;elves: both &s;eemed unwilling to begin the conver&s;ation, and to labour un|der the influence of mutual embarra&s;&s;ment. At length the abbot &s;poke: he conver&s;ed only on indifferent topics, and Matilda an&s;wered him in the &s;ame tone; &s;he &s;eem|ed anxious to make him forget that the per&s;on who &s;at by him was any other than Ro&s;ario. Neither of them dared, or indeed wi&s;hed, to make an allu&s;ion to the &s;ubject which was mo&s;t at the heart of both.</P>
<P>Matilda's efforts to appear gay were evidently forced;
<PB N="99" REF="035729_0097_10065875CDC25AA8">
her &s;pirits were oppre&s;&s;ed by the weight of anxiety; and when &s;he &s;poke, her voice was low and feeble; &s;he &s;eemed de&s;irous of fini&s;hing a conver&s;ation which embarra&s;&s;ed her; and, complaining that &s;he was un|well, &s;he reque&s;ted Ambro&s;io's permi&s;&s;ion to return to the abbey. He accompanied her to the door of her cell; and, when arrived there, he &s;topped her to de|clare his con&s;ent to her continuing the partner of his &s;olitude, &s;o long as &s;hould be agreeable to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>She di&s;covered no marks of plea&s;ure at receiving this intelligence, though on the preceding day &s;he had be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n &s;o anxious to obtain the permi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>"Alas, father," &s;he &s;aid, waving her head mourn|fully, "your kindne&s;s comes too late; my doom is fixed; we mu&s;t &s;eparate for ever: yet believe that I am grateful for your genero&s;ity, for your compa&s;&s;ion of an unfortunate who is but too little de&s;erving of it."</P>
<P>She put her handkerchief to her eyes; her cowl was only half drawn over her face. Ambro&s;io ob&s;erved that &s;he was pale, and her eyes &s;unk and heavy.</P>
<P>"Good God!" he cried, "you are very ill, Matil|da; I &s;hall &s;end father Pablos to you in&s;tantly."</P>
<P>"No, do not: I am ill 'tis true, but he cannot cure my malady. Farewell, father! Remember me in your prayers to-morrow, while I &s;hall remember you in heaven."</P>
<P>She entered her cell and clo&s;ed the door.</P>
<P>The abbot di&s;patched to her the phy&s;ician without lo&s;ing a moment, and waited his report impatiently; but father Pablos &s;oon returned, and declared that his
<PB N="100" REF="035729_0098_100658B3A8105CE8">
errand had been fruitle&s;s. Ro&s;ario refu&s;ed to admit him, and had po&s;itively rejected his offers of a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The unea&s;ine&s;s which this account gave Ambro&s;io was not trifling; yet he determined that Matilda &s;hould have her own way for that night, but that if her &s;ituation did not mend by the morning, he would in&s;i&s;t upon her taking the advice of father Pablos.</P>
<P>He did not find him&s;elf inclined to &s;leep; he opened his ca&s;ement, and gazed upon the moon|beams as they played upon the &s;mall &s;tream who&s;e waters bathed the walls of the mona&s;tery. The cool|ne&s;s of the night breeze, and tranquillity of the hour, in&s;pired the friar's mind with &s;adne&s;s; he thought upon Matilda's beauty and affection; upon the plea&s;|ures which he might have &s;hared with her, had he not been re&s;trained by mona&s;tic fetters. He reflected that, un&s;u&s;tained by hope, her love for him could not long exi&s;t; that doubtle&s;s &s;he would &s;ucceed in ex|tingui&s;hing her pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;eek for happine&s;s in the arms of one more fortunate. He &s;huddered at the void which her ab&s;ence would leave in his bo&s;om; he looked with di&s;gu&s;t on the monotony of a convent, and breathed a &s;igh towards that world from which he was for ever &s;eparated. Such were the reflections which a loud knocking at his door interrupted. The bell of the church had already &s;truck two. The ab|bot ha&s;tened to inquire the cau&s;e of this di&s;turbance. He opened the door of his cell, and a lay brother en|tered, who&s;e looks declared his hurry and confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>"Ha&s;ten, reverend father!" &s;aid he, "ha&s;ten to the young Ro&s;ario: he earne&s;tly reque&s;ts to &s;ee you; he lies at the point of death."</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="035729_0099_1006593E58602490">
"Gracious God! where is father Pablos? Why is he not with him? Oh! I fear, I fear&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Father Pablos has &s;een him, but his art can do noth|ing. He &s;ays that he &s;u&s;pects the youth to be poi&s;oned."</P>
<P>"Poi&s;oned? Oh! the unfortunate! It is then as I &s;u&s;pected! But let me not lo&s;e a moment; perhaps it may yet be time to &s;ave her."</P>
<P>He &s;aid, and flew towards the cell of the novice. Several monks were already in the chamber; father Pablos was one of them, and held a medicine in his hand, which he was endeavouring to per&s;uade Ro&s;ario to &s;wallow. The others were employed in admiring the patient's divine countenance, which they now &s;aw for the fir&s;t time. She looked lovelier than ever; &s;he was no longer pale or languid; a bright glow had &s;pread it&s;elf over he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> cheeks; her eyes &s;parkled with a &s;erene delight, and her countenance was expre&s;&s;ive of confidence and re&s;ignation.</P>
<P>"Oh! torment me no more!" was &s;he &s;aying to Pablos, when the terrified abbot ru&s;hed ha&s;tily into the cell; "my di&s;ea&s;e is far beyond the reach of your &s;kill, and I wi&s;h not to be cured of it." Then per|civing Ambro&s;io&mdash;"Ah, 'tis he!" &s;he cried; "I &s;ee him once again before we part for ever! Leave me my brethren; much have I to tell this holy man in private."</P>
<P>The monks retired immediately, and Matilda and the abbot remained together.</P>
<P>"What have you done, imprudent woman?" ex|claimed the latter, as &s;oon as they were left alone: "tell me, are my &s;u&s;picions ju&s;t? Am I indeed to
<PB N="102" REF="035729_0100_100658B664342870">
lo&s;e you? Has your own hand been the in&s;trument of your de&s;truction?"</P>
<P>She &s;miled, and gra&s;ped his hand.</P>
<P>"In what have I been imprudent, father? I have &s;acrificed a pebble, and &s;aved a diamond. My death pre&s;erves a life valuable to the world, and more dear to me than my own. Yes, father, I am poi&s;oned; but know that the poi&s;on once circulated in your veins."</P>
<P>"Matilda!"</P>
<P>"What I tell you I re&s;olved never to di&s;cover to you but on the bed of death; that moment is now ar|rived. You cannot have forgotten the day when your life was endangered by the bite of a cientipedoro. The phy&s;ician gave you over, declaring him&s;elf igno|rant how to extract the venom. I knew but of one means, and he&s;itated not a moment to employ it. I was left alone with you; you &s;lept; I loo&s;ened the bandage from your hand; I ki&s;&s;ed the wound, and drew out the poi&s;on with my lips. The effect has been more &s;udden than I expected. I feel death at my heart; yet an hour and I &s;hall be in a better world."</P>
<P>"Almighty God!" exclaimed the abbot and &s;unk almo&s;t lifele&s;s upon the bed.</P>
<P>After a few minutes he again rai&s;ed him&s;elf up &s;ud|denly, and gazed upon Matilda with all the wildne&s;s of de&s;pair.</P>
<P>"And you have &s;acrificed your&s;elf for me! You die, and die to pre&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ve Ambro&s;io! And is there indeed no remedy, Matilda? And is there indeed no hope? Speak to me, oh! &s;peak to me! Tell me that you have &s;till the means of life!"</P>

"Be comforted, my only friend! Yes, I have &s;till the means of life in my power; but it is a means which I dare not employ! it is dangerous; it is dread|ful! Life would be purcha&s;ed at too dear a rate,&mdash;un|le&s;s it were permitted me to live for you."</P>
<P>"Then live for me, Matilda; for me and grati|tude!"&mdash;(He caught her hand, and pre&s;&s;ed it raptur|ou&s;ly to his lips.)&mdash;"Remember our late conver&s;a|tions; I now con&s;ent to every thing. Remember in what lively colours you de&s;cribed the union of &s;ouls; be it ours to realize tho&s;e ideas. Let us forget the di&s;tinctions of &s;ex, de&s;pi&s;e the world's prejudices, and only con&s;ider each other as brother and friend. Live then, Matilda, oh! live for me!"</P>
<P>"Ambro&s;io, it mu&s;t not be. When I thought thus. I deceived both you and my&s;elf. Oh! &s;ince we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> conver&s;ed together, a dreadful veil has been rent from before my eyes. I love you no longer with the devo|tion which is paid to a &s;aint; I prize you no more for the virtues of your &s;oul.

<P>"Amazement! Matilda! Can it be you who &s;peak to me?"</P>
<P>He made a movement as if to quit his &s;eat. She uttered a loud &s;hriek, and, rai&s;ing her&s;elf half out of the bed, threw her arms round the friar to detain him.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="035729_0102_1006587CB9B671D0">
"Oh! do not leave me! Li&s;ten to my errors with compa&s;&s;ion: In a few hours I &s;hall be no more; yet a little, and I am free from this di&s;graceful pa&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>"Wretched woman, what can I &s;ay to you? I cannot&mdash;I mu&s;t not&mdash;But live, Matilda! oh, live!"</P>

<P>The hour was night. All was &s;ilence around. The faint beams of a &s;olitary lamp darted upon Ma|tilda's figure, and &s;hed through the chamber a dim, my&s;terious light.

<P>THE marquis and Lorenzo proceeded to the hotel in &s;ilence. The former employed him&s;elf in call|ing every circum&s;tance to his mind, which related, might give Lorenzo's the mo&s;t favourable idea of his connection with Agnes. The latter, ju&s;tly alarmed for the honor of his family, felt embarra&s;&s;ed by the pre&s;ence of the marquis: the adventure which he had ju&s;t witne&s;&s;ed forbade his treating him as a friend; and Antonia's intere&s;t being entru&s;ted to his mediation, he &s;aw the impolicy of treating him as a foe. He concluded from the&s;e reflections, that profound &s;ilence would be the wi&s;e&s;t plan, and waited with impatience for Don Raymond's explanation.</P>
<P>They arrived at the hotel de las Ci&s;ternas. The marquis immediately conducted him to his apartment, and began to expre&s;s his &s;atisfaction at finding him at Madrid. Lorenzo interrupted him.</P>
<P>"Excu&s;e me, my lord," &s;aid he with a di&s;tant air, "if I reply &s;omewhat coldly to your expre&s;&s;ions of regard. A &s;i&s;ter's honor is involved in this affair: till that is e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the purport of your corre&s;|pondence with Agnes cleared up, I cannot con&s;ider you as my friend. I am anxious to hear the mean|ing of your conduct; and hope that you will not de|lay the promi&s;ed explanation."</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="035729_0104_100658B910D5D850">
"Fir&s;t give me your word, that you will li&s;ten with patience and indulgence."</P>
<P>"I love my &s;i&s;ter too well to judge her har&s;hly; and, till this moment, I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no friend &s;o dear to me as your&s;elf. I will al&s;o confe&s;s, that your having it in your power to oblige me in a bu&s;ine&s;s which I have much at heart, makes me very anxious to find you &s;till de&s;erving my e&s;teem."</P>
<P>"Lorenzo, you tran&s;port me No greater plea&s;|ure can be given me, than an opportunity of &s;erving the brother of Agnes."</P>
<P>"Convince me that I can accept your favours without di&s;honor, and there is no man in the world to whom I am more willing to be obliged."</P>
<P>"Probably you have already heard your &s;i&s;ter men|tion the name of Alphon&s;o d'Alvarada?"</P>
<P>"Never. Though I feel for Agnes an affection truly fraternal, circum&s;tances have prevented us from being much together. While yet a child, &s;he was con&s;igned to the care of her aunt, who had married a German nobleman. At his ca&s;tle &s;he remained till two years &s;ince, when &s;he returned to Spain, deter|mined upon &s;ecluding her&s;elf from the world."</P>
<P>"Good God! Lorenzo, you knew of her intention, and yet &s;trove not to make her change it?"</P>
<P>"Marquis you wrong me: the intelligence, which I received at Naples, &s;hocked me extremely, and I ha&s;tened my return to Madrid for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of preventing the &s;acrifice. The moment that I ar|rived, I flew to the convent of St. Clare, in which
<PB N="107" REF="035729_0105_1006588023483A00">
Agnes had cho&s;en to perform her noviciate. I re|que&s;ted to &s;ee my &s;i&s;ter. Conceive my &s;urpri&s;e, when &s;he &s;ent me a refu&s;al: &s;he declared po&s;itively that, apprehending my influence over her mind, &s;he would not tru&s;t her&s;elf in my &s;ociety till the day before that on which &s;he was to receive the veil. I &s;upplicated the nuns; I in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;eeing Agnes; and he&s;|itated not to avow my &s;u&s;picions, that her being kept from me was again&s;t her own inclinations. To free her&s;elf from the imputation of violence, the priore&s;s brought me a few lines, written in my &s;i&s;ter's well known hand, repeating the me&s;&s;age already delivered. All future attempts to obtain a moment's conver&s;ation with her, were as fruitle&s;s as the fir&s;t. She was in|flexible, and I was not permitted to &s;ee her till the day preceding that on which &s;he entered the cloi&s;ter, never to quit it more. This interview took place in the pre&s;ence of our principal relations. It was for the fir&s;t time &s;ince her childhood that I &s;aw her, and the &s;cene was mo&s;t affecting: &s;he threw her&s;elf upon my bo&s;om, ki&s;&s;ed me, and wept bitterly. By every po&s;&s;ible argument, by tears, by prayers, by kneeling, I &s;trove to make her abandon her intention. I rep|re&s;ented to her all the hard&s;hips of a religious life; I painted to her imagination all the plea&s;ures which &s;he was going to quit; and be&s;ought her to di&s;clo&s;e to me what occa&s;ioned her di&s;gu&s;t to the world. At this la&s;t que&s;tion &s;he turned pale, and her tears flowed yet fa&s;ter. She entreated me not to pre&s;s her on that &s;ub|ject; that it &s;ufficed me to know that her re&s;olution was taken, and that a convent was the only place where &s;he could now hope for tranquillity. She per|&s;evered in her de&s;ign, and made her profe&s;&s;ion. I
<PB N="108" REF="035729_0106_100658BA9841BB68">
vi&s;ited her frequently at the grate; and every moment that I pa&s;&s;ed with her made me feel more affliction at her lo&s;s. I was &s;hortly after obliged to quit Madrid; I returned but ye&s;terday evening, and, &s;ince then, have not had time to call at St. Clare's convent."</P>
<P>"Then, till I mentioned it, you never heard the name of Alphon&s;o d'Alvarada?"</P>
<P>"Pardon me: my aunt wrote me word, that an adventurer so called had found means to get introduced into the ca&s;tle of Lindenberg; that he had in&s;inuated him&s;elf into my &s;i&s;ter's good graces: and that &s;he had even con&s;ented to elope with him. However, before the plan could be executed, the cavalier di&s;covered, that the e&s;tates which he believed Agnes to po&s;&s;e&s;s in Hi&s;paniola, in reality belonged to me. This intelli|gence made him change his intention; he di&s;appeared on the day that the elopement was to have taken place; and Agnes, in de&s;pair at his perfidy and mean|ne&s;s, had re&s;olved upon &s;eclu&s;ion in a convent. She added, that as this adventurer had given him&s;elf out to be a friend of mine, &s;he wi&s;hed to know whether I had any knowledge of him. I replied in the negative. I had then very little idea, that Alphon&s;o d'Alvarada and the marquis de las Ci&s;ternas were one and the &s;ame per&s;on: the de&s;cription given me of the fir&s;t, by no means tallied with what I knew of the latter."</P>

Forgive me, Lorenzo, if I &s;eem tedious in my nar|ration: the clo&s;e connection which now exi&s;ts be|tween us, makes me anxious that you &s;hould know every particular re&s;pecting me; and in my fear of omitting the lea&s;t circum&s;tance which may induce you to think favourably of your &s;i&s;ter and my&s;elf, I may po&s;&s;ibly relate many which you may think unintere&s;ting.</P>
<P>I followed the duke's advice: I was &s;oon con|vinced of its wi&s;dom. I quitted Spain, calling my|&s;elf by the a&s;&s;umed title of Don Alphon&s;o d'Alvarada, and attended by a &s;ingle dome&s;tic of approved fidelity. Paris was my fir&s;t &s;tation. For &s;ome time I was en|chanted with it, as indeed mu&s;t be every man who is young, rich, and fond of plea&s;ure. Yet, among all its gaieties, I felt that &s;omething was wanting to my heart: I grew &s;ick of di&s;&s;ipation; I di&s;covered that the people among whom I lived, and who&s;e exterior was &s;o poli&s;hed and &s;educing, were at bottom frivolous, unfeeling, and in&s;incere. I turned from the inhabit|ants of Paris with di&s;gu&s;t, and quitted that theatre of luxury without heaving one &s;igh of regret.</P>
<P>I now bent my cour&s;e towards Germany, intending to vi&s;it mo&s;t of the principal courts. Prior to this expedition, I meant to make &s;ome little &s;tay at Stra&s;|bourg. On quitting my chai&s;e at Luneville, to take &s;ome refre&s;hment, I ob&s;erved a &s;plendid equipage, at|tended by four dome&s;tics in rich liveries, waiting at the door of the Silver Lion. Soon after, as I looked out of the window, I &s;aw a lady of noble pre&s;ence, fol|lowed by two female attendants, &s;tep into the carriage, which drove off immediately.</P>
<P>I inquired of the ho&s;t who the lady was that had ju&s;t departed.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="035729_0110_100658BDA66C51A8">
"A German barone&s;s, mon&s;ieur, of great rank and fortune; &s;he has been upon a vi&s;it to the duche&s;s of Longueville, as her &s;ervants informed me. She is going to Stra&s;bourg, where &s;he will find her hu&s;band, and then both return to their ca&s;tle in Germany."</P>
<P>I re&s;umed my journey, intending to reach Stra&s;|bourg that night. My hopes, however, were fru&s;|trated by the breaking down of my chai&s;e: the ac|cident happened in the middle of a thick fore&s;t, and I was not a little embarra&s;&s;ed as to the means of pro|ceeding. It was the depth of winter: the night was already clo&s;ing round us; and Stra&s;bourg, which was the neare&s;t town, was &s;till di&s;tant from us &s;everal leagues. It &s;eemed to me that my only alternative to pa&s;&s;ing the night in the fore&s;t, was to take my &s;erv|ant's hor&s;e and ride on to Stra&s;bourg; an undertaking at that &s;ea&s;on very far from agreeable. However, &s;eeing no other re&s;ource, I was obliged to make up my mind to it; accordingly, I communicated my de|&s;ign to the po&s;tillion, telling him that I would &s;end people to a&s;&s;i&s;t him as &s;oon as I reached Stra&s;bourg. I had not much confidence in his hone&s;ty; but Steph|ano being well armed, and the driver, to all appear|ance, con&s;iderably advanced in years, I believed I ran no ri&s;k of lo&s;ing my baggage.</P>
<P>Luckily, as I then thought, an opportunity pre|&s;ented it&s;elf of pa&s;&s;ing the night more agreeably than I expected. On mentioning my de&s;ign of proceeding by my&s;elf to Stra&s;bourg, the po&s;tillion &s;hook his head in di&s;approbation.</P>
<P>"It is a long way," &s;aid he; "you will find it a difficult matter to arrive there without a guide: be|&s;ides,

<P>"What u&s;e is there to pre&s;ent me with all the&s;e objections?" &s;aid I, impatiently interrupting him: "I have no other re&s;ource; I run &s;till greater ri&s;k of peri&s;hing with cold by pa&s;&s;ing the night in the fore&s;t!"</P>
<P>"Pa&s;&s;ing the night in the fore&s;t!" he replied. "Oh, by St. Denis! we are not in quite &s;o bad a plight as that comes to yet. If I am not mi&s;taken, we are &s;carcely five minutes walk from the cottage of my old friend Bapti&s;te: he is a wood-cutter, and a very hone&s;t fellow. I doubt not but he will &s;helter you for the night with plea&s;ure. In the mean time, I can take the &s;addle-hor&s;e, ride to Stra&s;bourg, and be back with proper people to mend your carriage by break of day."</P>
<P>"And, in the name of God," &s;aid I, "how could you leave me &s;o long in &s;u&s;pen&s;e? Why did you not tell me of this cottage &s;ooner? What exce&s;&s;ive &s;tupid|ity!"</P>

<P>"Ab&s;urd! Come, come; &s;ay no more, but con|duct us without delay to the woodman's cottage."</P>
<P>He obeyed, and we moved onwards: the hor&s;es contrived, with &s;ome difficulty, to drag the &s;hattered vehicle after us. My &s;ervant was become almo&s;t &s;peechle&s;s, and I began to feel the effects of the cold
<PB N="114" REF="035729_0112_100658C175D55388">
my&s;elf before we reached the wi&s;hed for cottage. It was a &s;mall but neat building: as we drew near it I rejoiced at ob&s;erving through the window the blaze of a comfortable fire. Our conductor knocked at the door: it was &s;ome time before any one an&s;wered; the people within &s;eemed in doubt whether we &s;hould be admitted.</P>
<P>"Come, come, friend Bapti&s;te!" cried the driver with impatience, "what are you about? Are you a&s;leep? Or will you refu&s;e a night's lodging to a gen|tleman, who&s;e chai&s;e has ju&s;t broken down in the fore&s;t?"</P>
<P>"Ah! is it you, hone&s;t Claude?" replied a man's voice from within: "wait a moment, and the door &s;hall be opened."</P>
<P>Soon after the bolts were drawn back; the door was unclo&s;ed, and a man pre&s;ented him&s;elf to us with a lamp in his hand: he gave the guide an hearty re|ception, and then addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me:</P>
<P>"Walk in, mon&s;ieur; walk in, and welcome. Excu&s;e me for not admitting you at fir&s;t; but there are &s;o many rogues about this place, that &s;aving your pre&s;ence, I &s;u&s;pected you to be one."</P>
<P>Thus &s;aying, he u&s;hered me into the room where I had ob&s;erved the fire. I was immediately placed in an ea&s;y chair, which &s;tood clo&s;e to the hearth. A female, whom I &s;uppo&s;ed to be the wife of my ho&s;t, ro&s;e from her &s;eat upon my entrance, and received me with a &s;light and di&s;tant reverence. She made no an&s;wer to my compliment, but, immediately re&s;eat|ing her&s;elf, continued the work on which &s;he had
<PB N="115" REF="035729_0113_10065888B2B22A28">
been employed. Her hu&s;band's manners were as friendly as hers were har&s;h and repul&s;ive.</P>
<P>"I wi&s;h I could lodge you more conveniently, mon|&s;ieur," &s;aid he, "but we cannot boa&s;t of much &s;pare room in this hovel. However, a chamber for your|&s;elf and another for your &s;ervant, I think, we can make &s;hift to &s;upply. You mu&s;t content your&s;elf with &s;orry fare; but to what we have, believe me, you are heartily welcome."&mdash;Then turning to his wife&mdash;"Why how you &s;it there, Marguerite, with as much tranquillity as if you had nothing better to do! &s;tir about, dame! &s;tir about! Get &s;ome &s;upper; look out &s;ome &s;heets. Here, here! throw &s;ome logs upon the fire for the gentleman &s;eems peri&s;hed with cold."</P>
<P>The wife threw her work ha&s;tily upon the table, and proceeded to execute his commands with every mark of unwillingne&s;s. Her countenance had di&s;|plea&s;ed me on the fir&s;t moment of my examining it: yet upon the whole, her features were hand&s;ome un|que&s;tionably; but her &s;kin was &s;allow, and her per|&s;on thin and meagre a lowering gloom over&s;pread her countenance, and it bore &s;uch vi&s;ible marks of rancour and ill will, as could not e&s;cape being noticed by the mo&s;t inattentive ob&s;erver; her every look and action expre&s;&s;ed di&s;content and impatience; and the an&s;wers which &s;he gave Bapti&s;te, when he reproached her good-humouredly for her di&s;&s;atisfied air, were tart, &s;hort, and cutting. In fine, I conceived at fir&s;t &s;ight equal di&s;gu&s;t for her, and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in favour of her hu&s;band, who&s;e appearance was calculated to in&s;pire e&s;teem and confidence. His countenance was open,
<PB N="116" REF="035729_0114_100658C301DAC6F8">
&s;incere, and friendly; his manners had all the pea&s;|ant's hone&s;ty, unaccompanied by his rudene&s;s: his cheeks were broad, full and ruddy; and in the &s;olid|ity of his per&s;on he &s;eemed to offer an ample apology for the leanne&s;s of his wife's. From the wrinkles on his brow, I judged him to be turned of &s;ixty; but he bore his years well, and &s;eemed &s;till hearty and &s;trong. The wife could not be more than thirty, but in &s;pirits and vivacity &s;he was infinitely older than the hu&s;band.</P>
<P>However, in &s;pite of her unwillingne&s;s, Margue|rite began to prepare the &s;upper, while the woodman conver&s;ed gaily on different &s;ubjects. The po&s;tillion, who had been furni&s;hed with a bottle of &s;pirits, was now ready to &s;et out for Stra&s;bourg, and inquired whether I had any further commands.</P>
<P>"For Stra&s;bourg?" interrupted Bapti&s;te; "you are not going thither to-night?"</P>
<P>"I beg your pardon: if I do not fetch workmen to mend the chai&s;e, how is mon&s;ieur to proceed to-morrow?"</P>
<P>"That is true, as you &s;ay, I had forgot the chai&s;e. Well, but, Claude, you may at lea&s;t eat your &s;upper here? That can make you lo&s;e very little time; and mon&s;ieur looks too kind hearted to &s;end you out with an empty &s;tomach on &s;uch a bitter cold night as this is."</P>
<P>To this I readily a&s;&s;ented, telling the po&s;tillion that my reaching Stra&s;bourg the next day an hour or two later would be perfectly immaterial. He thanked me, and then, leaving the cottage with Stephano, put up
<PB N="117" REF="035729_0115_1006588A39C96D30">
his hor&s;es in the woodman's &s;table. Bapti&s;te followed them to the door, and looked out with anxiety.</P>
<P>"'Tis a &s;harp, biting wind," &s;aid he: "I wonder what detains my boys &s;o long! Mon&s;ieur, I &s;hall &s;hew you two of the fine&s;t la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> that ever &s;tepped in &s;hoe of leather: the elde&s;t is three and twenty, the &s;econd a year younger: their equals for &s;en&s;e, courage, and ac|tivity, are not to be found within fifty miles of Stra&s;|bourg. Would they were back again! I begin to feel unea&s;y about them."</P>
<P>Marguerite was at this time employed in laying the cloth.</P>
<P>"And are you equally anxious for the return of your &s;ons?" &s;aid I to her.</P>
<P>"Not I," &s;he replied peevi&s;hly; "they are no chil|dren of mine."</P>
<P>"Come, come, Marguerite!" &s;aid the hu&s;band, "do not be out of humour with the gentleman for a&s;king a &s;imple que&s;tion: had you not looked &s;o cro&s;s, he would never have thought you old enough to have a &s;on of three and twenty; but you &s;ee how many years ill temper adds to you!&mdash;Excu&s;e my wife's rudene&s;s, mon&s;ieur; a little thing puts her out; and &s;he is &s;ome|what di&s;plea&s;ed at your not thinking her under thirty.

If you have not &s;ons as old, you will &s;ome twenty years hence; and I hope that we &s;hall live to &s;ee them ju&s;t &s;uch lads as Jacques and Robert."</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="035729_0116_100658CA4A8F1060">
Marguerite cla&s;ped her hands together pa&s;&s;ionately.</P>
<P>"God forbid!" &s;aid &s;he, "God forbid! If I thought it, I would &s;trangle them with my own hands."</P>
<P>She quitted the room ha&s;tily, and went up &s;tairs.</P>
<P>I could not help expre&s;&s;ing to the woodman how much I pitied him for being chained for life to a part|ner of &s;uch ill humour.</P>
<P>"Ah, Lord! mon&s;ieur, every one has his &s;hare of grievances, and Marguerite has fallen to mine. Be|&s;ides, after all, &s;he is only cro&s;s, and not malicious: the wor&s;t is, that her affection for two children by a former hu&s;band makes her play the &s;tep mother with my two &s;ons; &s;he cannot bear the &s;ight of them; and, by her good will, they would never &s;et a foot within my door. But on this point I always &s;tand firm, and never will con&s;ent to abandon the poor lads to the world's mercy, as &s;he has often &s;olicited me to do. In every thing el&s;e I let her have her own way; and truly &s;he manages a family rarely, that I mu&s;t &s;ay for her."</P>
<P>We were conver&s;ing in this manner, when our di&s;|cour&s;e was interrupted by a loud halloo, which rang through the fore&s;t.</P>
<P>"My &s;ons, I hope!" exclaimed the woodman, and ran to open the door.</P>
<P>The halloo was repeated. We now di&s;tingui&s;hed the trampling of hor&s;es; and, &s;oon after, a carriage attended by &s;everal cavaliers &s;topped at the cottage door. One of the hor&s;emen inquired how far they were &s;till from Stra&s;bourg. As he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf
<PB N="119" REF="035729_0117_1006588E1837D828">
to me, I an&s;wered in the number of miles which Claude had told me; upon which a volley of cur&s;es was vented again&s;t the drivers for having lo&s;t their way. The per&s;ons in the coach were now informed of the di&s;tance of Stra&s;bourg; and al&s;o that the hor&s;es were &s;o fatigued as to be incapable of proceeding fur|ther. A lady who appeared to be the principal, ex|pre&s;&s;ed much chagrin at this intelligence; but as there was no remedy, one of the attendants a&s;ked the wood|man whether he could furni&s;h them with lodging for the night.</P>
<P>He &s;eemed much embarra&s;&s;ed, and replied in the negative; adding, that a Spani&s;h gentleman and his &s;ervant were already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the only &s;pare apartments in his hou&s;e. On hearing this, the gal|lantry of my nation would not permit me to retain tho&s;e accommodations of which a female was in want. I in&s;tantly &s;ignified to the woodman that I transferred my right to the lady: he made &s;ome objections, but I overruled them, and ha&s;tening to the carriage, opened the door, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted the lady to de&s;cend. I immedi|ately recogni&s;ed her for the &s;ame per&s;on whom I had &s;een at the inn at Luneville. I took an opportunity of a&s;king one of her attendants what was her name?</P>
<P>"The barone&s;s Lindenberg," was the an&s;wer.</P>
<P>I could not but remark how different a reception our ho&s;t had given the&s;e new comers and my&s;elf. His reluctance to admit them was vi&s;ibly expre&s;&s;ed on his countenance; and he prevailed on him&s;elf with difficulty to tell the lady that &s;he was welcome. I conducted her into the hou&s;e, and placed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">er in the arm chair which I had ju&s;t quitted. She thanked
<PB N="120" REF="035729_0118_100658C4C7AE0C98">
me very graciou&s;ly, and made a thou&s;and apologies for putting me to an inconvenience. Suddenly the wood|man's countenance cleared up.</P>
<P>"A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> la&s;t I have arranged it!" &s;aid he, interrupting her excu&s;es. "I can lodge you and your &s;uite, madam, and you will not be under the nece&s;&s;ity of making this gentleman &s;uffer for his politene&s;s. We have two &s;pare chambers, one for the lady, the other, mon&s;ieur, for you: my wife &s;hall give up hers to the two waiting women: as for the men &s;ervants, they mu&s;t content them&s;elves with pa&s;&s;ing the night in and ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rn, which &s;tands at a few yards di&s;tance from the hou&s;e; there they &s;hall have a blazing fire, and as good a &s;upper as we can make &s;hift to give them."</P>
<P>After &s;everal expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude on the lady's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and oppo&s;ition on mine to Marguerite's giving up her bed, this arrangement was agreed to. As the room was &s;mall, the barone&s;s immediately di&s;mi&s;&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> male dome&s;tics. Bapti&s;te was on the point of conducting them to the barn which he had mentioned, when two young men appeared at the door of the cottage.</P>
<P>"Hell and furies!" exclaimed the fir&s;t, &s;tarting back, "Robert the hou&s;e is filled with &s;trangers!"</P>
<P>"Ha! there are my &s;ons!" cried our ho&s;t. "Why, Jacques! Robert! whither are you running boys? There is room enough &s;till for you."</P>
<P>Upon this a&s;&s;urance the youths returned. The father pre&s;ented them to the barone&s;s and my&s;elf; after which he withdrew with our dome&s;tics, while, at the reque&s;t of the two waiting women, Margue|rite
<PB N="121" REF="035729_0119_1006588F9F426D18">
conducted them to the room de&s;igned for their mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The two new comers were tall, &s;tout, well made young men, hard featured, and very much &s;un burnt. They paid their compliments to us in few words, and acknowledged Claude, who now entered the room, as an old acquaintance. They then threw a&s;ide their cloaks in which they were wrapped up, took off a leathern belt, to which a large cutla&s;s was &s;u&s;pended, and each drawing a brace of pi&s;tols from his girdle laid them upon a &s;helf.</P>
<P>"You travel well armed," &s;aid I.</P>
<P>"True, mon&s;ieur," replied Robert. "We left Stra&s;bourg late this evening, and 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to take precautions at pa&s;&s;ing through this fore&s;t after dark; it does not bear a good repute, I promi&s;e you."</P>
<P>"How?" &s;aid the barone&s;s, "are there robbers hereabout?"</P>
<P>"So it is &s;aid, madame: for my own part, I have travelled through the wood at all hours, and never met with one of them."</P>
<P>Here Marguerite returned. Her &s;tep &s;ons drew her to the other end of the room, and whi&s;pered her for &s;ome minutes. By the looks which they ca&s;t towards us at intervals, I conjectured them to be inquiring our bu&s;ine&s;s in the cottage.</P>
<P>In the mean while, the barone&s;s expre&s;&s;ed her ap|prehen&s;ions that her hu&s;band would be &s;uffering much anxiety upon her account. She had intended to &s;end on one of her &s;ervants to inform the baron of her de|lay;
<PB N="122" REF="035729_0120_100658C64E4A37E8">
but the account which the young men gave of the fore&s;t rendered this plan impracticable. Claude relieved her from her embarra&s;&s;ment: he informed her, that he was under the nece&s;&s;ity of reaching Stra&s;|bourg that night; and that, would &s;he tru&s;t him with a letter, &s;he might depend upon its being &s;afely de|livered.</P>
<P>"And how comes it," &s;aid I, "that you are under no apprehen&s;ion of meeting the&s;e robbers?"</P>
<P>"Alas! mon&s;ieur, a poor man with a large family mu&s;t not lo&s;e certain profit becau&s;e 'tis attended with a little danger; and perhaps my lord the baron may give me a trifle for my pains; be&s;ides, I have noth|ing to lo&s;e except my life, and that will not be worth the robbers taking."</P>
<P>I thought his arguments bad, and advi&s;ed his waiting till the morning; but, as the barone&s;s did not &s;econd me, I was obliged to give up the point. The barone&s;s Lindenberg, as I found afterwards, had long been accu&s;tomed to &s;acrifice the intere&s;ts of oth|ers to her own, and her wi&s;h to &s;end Claude to Stra&s;|bourg blinded her to the danger of the undertaking. Accordingly, it was re&s;olved that he &s;hould &s;et out without delay. The barone&s;s wrote her letter to her hu&s;band; and I &s;ent a few lines to my banker, ap|pri&s;ing him that I &s;hould not be at Stra&s;bourg till the next day. Claude took our letters, and left the cot|tage.</P>
<P>The lady declared her&s;elf much fatigued by her journey: be&s;ides having come from &s;ome di&s;tance, the drivers had contrived to lo&s;e their way in the fore&s;t. She now addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to Marguerite, de|&s;iring
<PB N="123" REF="035729_0121_1006589127814030">
to be &s;hewn to her chamber, and permitted to take half an hour's repo&s;e. One of the waiting women was immediately &s;ummoned; &s;he appeared with a light, and the barone&s;s followed her up &s;tairs. The cloth was &s;preading in the chamber where I was, and Marguerite &s;oon gave me to under&s;tand that I was in her way. Her hints were too broad to be ea&s;ily mi&s;taken; I therefore de&s;ired one of the young men to conduct me to the chamber where I was to &s;leep, and where I could remain till &s;upper was ready.</P>
<P>"Which chamber is it, mother?" &s;aid Robert.</P>
<P>"The one with green hangings," &s;he replied. "I have ju&s;t been at the trouble of getting it ready, and have put fre&s;h &s;heets upon the bed: if the gentleman choo&s;es to lollop and lounge upon it, he may make it again him&s;elf, for me."</P>
<P>"You are out of humour, mother; but that is no novelty. Have the goodne&s;s to follow me, mon&s;ieur."</P>
<P>He opened the door, and advanced towards a narrow &s;tairca&s;e.</P>
<P>"You have got no light," &s;aid Marguerite; "is it your own neck, or the gentleman's that you have a mind to break?"</P>
<P>She cro&s;&s;ed by me, and put a candle into Robert's hand; having received which, he began to a&s;cend the &s;tairca&s;e. Jacques was employed in laying the cloth, and his back was turned towards me. Marguerite &s;eized the moment when we were unob&s;erved: &s;he caught my hand, and pre&s;&s;ed it &s;trongly.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="035729_0122_1006589813C45D20">
"Look at the &s;heets!" &s;aid &s;he as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed me, and immediately re&s;umed her former occupation.</P>
<P>Startled by the abruptne&s;s of her action, I re|mained as if petrified. Robert's voice de&s;iring me to follow him recalled me to my&s;elf. I a&s;cended the &s;taircai&s;e. My conductor u&s;hered me into a cham|ber where an excellent wood fire was blazing upon the hearth. He placed the light upon the table, in|quired whether I had any further commands, and, on my replying in the negative, left me to my&s;elf. You may be certain, that the moment when I found my|&s;elf alone was that on which I complied with Mar|guerite's injunction. I took the candle ha&s;tily, ap|proached the bed, and turned down the coverture. What was my a&s;toni&s;hment, my horror, at finding the &s;heets crim&s;oned with blood!</P>
<P>At that moment a thou&s;and confu&s;ed ideas pa&s;&s;ed before my imagination. The robbers who infe&s;ted the wood, Marguerite's exclamation re&s;pecting her children, the arms and appearance of the two young men, and the various anecdotes which I had heard related re&s;pecting the &s;ecret corre&s;pondence which frequently exi&s;ts between banditti and po&s;tillions; all the&s;e circum&s;tances fla&s;hed upon my mind, and in&s;pir|ed me with doubt and apprehen&s;ion. I ruminated on the mo&s;t probable means of a&s;certaining the truth of my conjectures. Suddenly I was aware of &s;ome one be|low, pacing ha&s;tily backwards and forwards. Every thing now appeared to me an object of &s;u&s;picion. With precaution I drew near the window, which, as the room had been long &s;hut up, was left open in &s;pite of the cold. I ventured to look out.
<PB N="125" REF="035729_0123_10065892B37A4C88">
The beams of the moon permitted me to di&s;tingui&s;h a man, whom I had no difficulty to recogni&s;e for my ho&s;t. I watched his movements. He walked &s;wiftly, then &s;topped and &s;eemed to li&s;ten: he &s;tamped upon the ground, and beat his &s;tomach with his arms, as if to guard him&s;elf from the inclemency of the &s;ea&s;on: at the lea&s;t noi&s;e, if a voice was heard in the lower part of the hou&s;e, if a bat flitted pa&s;t him, or the wind rattled amid&s;t the leafle&s;s boughs, he &s;tarted, and looked round with anxiety.</P>
<P>"Plague take him!" &s;aid he at length with ex|treme impatience; "what can he be about?"</P>
<P>He &s;poke in a low voice; but as he was ju&s;t below my window, I had no difficulty to di&s;tingui&s;h his words.</P>
<P>I now heard the &s;teps of one approaching. Bap|ti&s;te went towards the &s;ound; he joined a man, whom his low &s;tature and the horn &s;u&s;pended from his neck declared to be no other than my faithful Claude, whom I had &s;uppo&s;ed to be already on his way to Stra&s;bourg. Expecting their di&s;cour&s;e to throw &s;ome light upon my &s;ituation, I ha&s;tened to put my&s;elf in a condition to hear it with &s;afety. For this purpo&s;e I extingui&s;hed the candle, which &s;tood upon a table near the bed: the flame of the fire was not &s;trong enough to betray me, and I immediately re&s;umed my place at the window.</P>
<P>The objects of my curio&s;ity had &s;tationed them&s;elves directly under it. I &s;uppo&s;e that, during my momen|tary ab&s;ence, the woodman had been blaming Claude for tardine&s;s, &s;ince when I returned to the window the latter was endeavouring to excu&s;e his fault.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="035729_0124_100658CBD2D9DDE0">
"However," added he, "my diligence at pre&s;ent &s;hall make up for my pa&s;t delay."</P>
<P>"On that condition," an&s;wered Bapti&s;te, "I &s;hall readily forgive you: but in truth, as you &s;hare equal|ly with us in our prizes, your own intere&s;t will make you u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible diligence. 'Twould be a &s;hame to let &s;uch a noble booty e&s;cape us. You &s;ay that this Spaniard is rich?"</P>
<P>"His &s;ervant boa&s;ted at the inn, that the effects in his chai&s;e were worth above two thou&s;and pi&s;toles."</P>
<P>Oh! how I cur&s;ed Stephano's imprudent vanity!</P>
<P>"And I have been told," continued the po&s;tillion, "that this barone&s;s carries about her a ca&s;ket of jew|els of immen&s;e value."</P>
<P>"May be &s;o, but I had rather &s;he had &s;tayed away. The Spaniard was a &s;ecure prey; the boys and my|&s;elf could ea&s;ily have ma&s;tered him and his &s;ervant, and then the two thou&s;and pi&s;toles would have been &s;hared between us four. Now we mu&s;t let in the band for a &s;hare, and perhaps the whole covey may e&s;cape us. Should our friends have betaken them&s;elves to their different po&s;ts before you reach the cavern, all will be lo&s;t. The lady's attendants are too numerous for us to overpower them. Unle&s;s our a&s;&s;ociates arrive in time, we mu&s;t needs let the&s;e travellers &s;et out to-morrow without damage or hurt.</P>
<P>"'Tis plaguy unlucky that my comrades who drove the coach &s;hould be tho&s;e unacquainted with our con|federacy! But never fear, friend Bapti&s;te: an hour will bring me to the cavern; it is now but ten

o'clock, and by twelve you may expect the arrival of the band. By the bye, take care of your wife; you know how &s;trong is her repugnance to our mode of life, and &s;he may find means to give information to the lady's &s;ervants of our de&s;ign."</P>
<P>"Oh! I am &s;ecure of her &s;ilence; &s;he is too much afraid of me, and fond of her children, to dare to betray my &s;ecret. Be&s;ides, Jacques and Robert keep a &s;trict eye over her, and &s;he is not permitted to &s;et a foot out of the cottage. The &s;ervants are &s;afely lodged in the barn. I &s;hall endeavour to keep all quiet till the ar|rival of our friends. Were I a&s;&s;ured of your finding them, the &s;trangers &s;hould be di&s;patched this in&s;tant; but as it is po&s;&s;ible for you to mi&s;s the banditti, I am fearful of being &s;ummoned by their dome&s;tics to pro|duce them in the morning."</P>
<P>"And &s;uppo&s;e either of the travellers &s;hould di&s;|cover your de&s;ign?"</P>
<P>"Then we mu&s;t poignard tho&s;e in our power, and take our chance about ma&s;tering the re&s;t. However, to avoid running &s;uch a ri&s;k, ha&s;ten to the cavern; the banditti never leave it before eleven, and if you u&s;e diligence you may reach it in time to &s;top them."</P>
<P>"Tell Robert that I have taken his hor&s;e; my own has broken his bridle, and e&s;caped into the wood. What is the watch word?"</P>
<P>"The reward of courage."</P>
<P>"'Tis &s;ufficient. I ha&s;ten to the cavern."</P>
<P>"And I to rejoin my gue&s;ts, le&s;t my ab&s;ence &s;hould create &s;u&s;picion. Farewell, and be diligent."</P>

The&s;e worthy a&s;&s;ociates now &s;eparated; the one bent his cour&s;e towards the &s;table, while the other re|turned to the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>You may judge what mu&s;t have been my feelings during this conver&s;ation, of which I lo&s;t not a &s;ingle &s;yllable. I dared not tru&s;t my&s;elf to my reflections, nor did any means pre&s;ent it&s;elf to e&s;cape the dangers which threatened me. Re&s;i&s;tance I knew to be vain; I was unarmed, and a &s;ingle man again&s;t three. However, I re&s;olved at lea&s;t to &s;ell my life as dearly as I could. Dreading le&s;t Bapti&s;te &s;hould perceive my ab&s;ence, and &s;u&s;pect me to have overheard the me&s;|&s;age with which Claude was di&s;patched, I ha&s;tily re|lighted my candle and quitted the chamber. On de|&s;cending, I found the table &s;pread for &s;ix per&s;ons. The barone&s;s &s;at by the fire &s;id<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">; Marguerite was employed in dre&s;&s;ing a &s;allad, and her &s;tep &s;ons were whi&s;pering together at the further end of the room. Bapti&s;te, having the round of the garden to make ere he could reach the cottage door, was not yet arrived. I &s;eated my&s;elf quietly oppo&s;ite to the barone&s;s.</P>
<P>A glance upon Marguerite told her that her hint had not been thrown away upon me. How different did &s;he now appear to me! What before &s;eemed gloom and &s;ullenne&s;s, I now found to be di&s;gu&s;t at her a&s;&s;ociates and compa&s;&s;ion for my danger. I looked up to her as to my only re&s;ource; yet knowing her to be watched by her hu&s;band with a &s;u&s;picious eye, I could place but little reliance on the exertions of her good will.</P>
<P>In &s;pite of all my endeavours to conceal it, my agi|tation was but too vi&s;ibly expre&s;&s;ed upon my counte|nance.
<PB N="129" REF="035729_0127_10065899B6960F60">
I was pale, and both my words and actions were di&s;ordered and embarra&s;&s;ed. The young men ob&s;erved this, and inquired the cau&s;e. I attributed it to exce&s;s of fatigue, and the violent effect produced on me by the &s;everity of the &s;ea&s;on. Whether they believed me or not, I will not pretend to &s;ay; they at lea&s;t cea&s;ed to embarra&s;s me with their que&s;tions. I &s;trove to divert my attention from the perils which &s;urrounded me, by conver&s;ing on different &s;ubjects with the barone&s;s. I talked of Germany, declaring my intention of vi&s;iting it immediately: God knows that I little thought at that moment of ever &s;eeing it! She replied to me with great ea&s;e and politene&s;s, profe&s;&s;ed that the plea&s;ure of making my acquaintance amply compen&s;ated for the delay in her journey, and gave me a pre&s;&s;ing invitation to make &s;ome &s;tay at the ca&s;tle of Lindenberg. As &s;he &s;poke thus, the youths exchanged a malicious &s;mile, which declared that &s;he would be fortunate if &s;he ever reached that ca&s;tle her|&s;elf. This action did not e&s;cape me; but I conceal|ed the emotion which it excited in my brea&s;t. I con|tinued to conver&s;e with the lady; but my di&s;cour&s;e was &s;o frequently incoherent that, as &s;he has &s;ince in|formed me, &s;he began to doubt whether I was in my right &s;en&s;es. The fact was, that while my conver&s;a|tion turned upon one &s;ubject, my thoughts were en|tirely occupied by another. I meditated upon the means of quitting the cottage, finding my way to the barn, and giving the dome&s;tics information of our ho&s;t's de&s;igns. I was &s;oon convinced how imprac|ticable was the attempt. Jacques and Robert watch|ed my every movement with an attentive eye, and I was obliged to abandon the idea. All my hopes now
<PB N="130" REF="035729_0128_100658D2AADBF450">
re&s;ted upon Claude's not finding the banditti. In that ca&s;e, according to what I had overheard, we &s;hould be permitted to depart unhurt.</P>
<P>I &s;huddered involuntarily as Bapti&s;te entered the room. He made many apologies for his long ab&s;ence, "but he had been detained by affairs impo&s;&s;ible to be delayed." He then entreated permi&s;&s;ion for his family to &s;up at the &s;ame table with us, without which, re&s;pect would not authorize his taking &s;uch a liberty. Oh! how in my heart I cur&s;ed the hypo|crite! how I loathed his pre&s;ence, who was on the point of depriving me of an exi&s;tence, at that time in|finitely dear! I had every rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with life; I had youth, wealth, rank, and education, and the faire&s;t pro&s;pects pre&s;ented them&s;elves before me. I &s;aw tho&s;e pro&s;pects on the point of clo&s;ing in the mo&s;t horrible manner: yet was I obliged to di&s;&s;im|ulate, and to receive with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> blance of gratitude the fal&s;e civilities of him who held the dagger to my bo&s;om.</P>
<P>The permi&s;&s;ion which our ho&s;t demanded was ea&s;i|ly obtained. We &s;eated our&s;elves at table. The barone&s;s and my&s;elf occupied one &s;ide; the &s;ons were oppo&s;ite to us, with their backs to the door. Bapti&s;te took his &s;eat by the barone&s;s, at the upper end; and the place next to him was left for his wife. She &s;oon entered the room, and placed before us a plain but comfortable pea&s;ant's repa&s;t. Our ho&s;t thought it nece&s;&s;ary to apologize for the poorne&s;s of the &s;upper: "he had not been apprized of our coming; he could only offer us &s;uch fare as had been intended for his own family."</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="035729_0129_1006589B44791C70">
"But," added he, "&s;hould any accident detain my noble gue&s;ts longer than they at pre&s;ent intend, I hope to give them better treatment."</P>
<P>The villain! I well knew the accident to which he alluded. I &s;huddered at the treatment which he taught us to expect.</P>
<P>My companion in danger &s;eemed entirely to have got rid of her chagrin at being delayed. She laughed, and conver&s;ed with the family with infinite gaiety. I &s;trove, but in vain, to follow her example. My &s;pirits were evidently forced, and the con&s;traint which I put upon my&s;elf e&s;caped not Bapti&s;te's ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>"Come, come, mon&s;ieur, cheer up!" &s;aid he, "you &s;eem not quite recovered from your fatigue. To rai&s;e your &s;pirits, what &s;ay you to a gla&s;s of excellent old wine which was left me by my father? God re&s;t his &s;oul, he is in a better world! I &s;eldom produce this wine; but as I am not honoured with &s;uch gue&s;ts every day, this is an occa&s;ion which de&s;erves a bottle."</P>
<P>He then gave his wife a key, and in&s;tructed her where to find the wine of which he &s;poke. She &s;eem|ed by no means plea&s;ed with the commi&s;&s;ion; &s;he took the key with an embarra&s;&s;ed air, and he&s;itated to quit the table.</P>
<P>"Did you hear me?" &s;aid Bapti&s;te, in an angry tone.</P>
<P>Marguerite darted upon him a look of mingled an|ger and fear, and left the chamber. His eyes follow|ed her &s;u&s;piciou&s;ly till &s;he had clo&s;ed the door.</P>
<P>She &s;oon returned with a bottle &s;ealed with yellow wax. She placed it upon the table, and gave the key
<PB N="132" REF="035729_0130_100658D00436FEA8">
back to her hu&s;band. I &s;u&s;pected that this liquor was not pre&s;ented to us without de&s;ign, and I watched Marguerite's movements with inquietude. She was employed in rin&s;ing &s;ome &s;mall horn goblets. As &s;he placed them before Bapti&s;te, &s;he &s;aw that my eye was fixed upon her; and at the moment when &s;he thought her&s;elf unob&s;erved by the banditti, &s;he motioned to me with her head not to ta&s;te the liquor. She then re|&s;umed her place.</P>
<P>In he mean while our ho&s;t had drawn the cork, and filling two of the goblets offered them to the lady and my&s;elf. She at fir&s;t made &s;ome objections; but the in&s;tances of Bapti&s;te were &s;o urgent, that &s;he was obliged to comply. Fearing to excite &s;u&s;picion, I he&s;itated not to take the goblet pre&s;ented to me. By its &s;mell and colour, I gue&s;&s;ed it to be champaign; but &s;ome grains of powder floating upon the top con|vinced me that it was not unadulterated. However, I dared not expre&s;s my repugnance to drinking it; I lifted it to my lips, and &s;eemed to be &s;wallowing it: &s;uddenly &s;tarting from my chair, I made the be&s;t of my way towards a va&s;e of water at &s;ome di&s;tance, in which Marguerite had been rin&s;ing the goblets. I pretended to &s;pit out the wine with di&s;gu&s;t, and took an opportunity, unperceived, of emptying the liquor into the va&s;e.</P>
<P>The banditti &s;eemed alarmed at my action. Jac|ques half ro&s;e from his chair, put his hand into his bo&s;om, and I di&s;covered the haft of a dagger. I re|turned to my &s;eat with tranquillity, and affected not to have ob&s;erved their confu&s;ion.</P>

&s;aid I, addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to Bapti&s;te: "I never can drink champaign without its producing a violent ill|ne&s;s. I &s;wallowed a few mouthfuls ere I was aware of its quality, and fear that I &s;hall &s;uffer for my im|prudence."</P>
<P>Bapti&s;te and Jacques exchanged looks of di&s;tru&s;t.</P>
<P>"Perhaps," &s;aid Robert, "the &s;mell may be di&s;a|greeable to you?"</P>
<P>He quitted his chair and removed the goblet. I ob&s;erved that he examined whether it was nearly empty.</P>
<P>"He mu&s;t have drank &s;ufficient," &s;aid he to his brother in a low voice, while he re&s;eated him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Marguerite looked apprehen&s;ive that I had ta&s;ted the liquor. A glance from my eye rea&s;&s;ured her.</P>
<P>I waited with anxiety for the effects which the beverage would produce upon the lady. I doubted not but the grains which I had ob&s;erved were poi&s;on|ous, and lamented that it had been impo&s;&s;ible for me to warn her of the danger. But a few minutes had elap&s;ed, before I perceived her eyes grow heavy: her head &s;unk upon her &s;houlder, and &s;he fell into a deep &s;leep. I affected not to attend to this circum|&s;tance, and continued my conver&s;ation with Bapti&s;te, with all the outward gaiety in my power to a&s;&s;ume. But he no longer an&s;wered me without con&s;traint. He eyed me with di&s;tru&s;t and a&s;toni&s;hment, and I &s;aw that the banditti were frequently whi&s;pering among them&s;elves. My &s;ituation became every moment more painful: I &s;u&s;tained the character of confidence with
<PB N="134" REF="035729_0132_100658D43237DD90">
a wor&s;e grace than ever. Equally afraid of the arrival of their accomplices, and of their &s;u&s;pecting my knowledge of their de&s;igns, I knew not how to di&s;&s;i|pate the di&s;tru&s;t which the banditti evidently entertain|ed for me. In this new dilemma the friendly Mar|guerite again a&s;&s;i&s;ted me. She pa&s;&s;ed behind the chairs of her &s;tep &s;ons, &s;topped for a moment oppo&s;ite to me, clo&s;ed her eyes, and reclined her head upon her &s;houl|der. This hint immediately di&s;pelled my incertitude. It told me, that I ought to imitate the barone&s;s, and pretend that the liquor had taken its full effect upon me. I did &s;o, and in a few minutes &s;eemed perfectly overcome with &s;lumber.</P>
<P>"So!" cried Bapti&s;te, as I fell back in my chair, "at la&s;t he &s;leeps! I began to think that he had &s;cent|ed our de&s;ign, and that we &s;hould have been forced to di&s;patch him at all events."</P>
<P>"And why not di&s;patch him at all events?" inquir|ed the ferocious Jacques, "why leave him the po&s;|&s;ibility of betraying our &s;ecret? Marguerite give me one of my pi&s;tols: a &s;ingle touch of the trigger will fini&s;h him at once."</P>
<P>"And &s;uppo&s;ing," rejoined the father, "&s;uppo&s;ing that our friends &s;hould not arrive to-night, a pretty figure we &s;hould make when the &s;ervants inquire for him in the morning! No, no, Jacques; we mu&s;t wait for our a&s;&s;ociates. If they join us, we are &s;trong enough to di&s;patch the dome&s;tic as well as their ma&s;ters, and the booty is our own. If Claude does not find the troop, we mu&s;t take patience, and &s;uffer the prey to &s;lip through our fingers. Ah! boys, boys, had you arrived but five minutes &s;ooner, the Spaniard
<PB N="135" REF="035729_0133_100658A0AB0BCE50">
would have been done for, and two thou&s;and pi&s;toles our own. But you are always out of the way when you are mo&s;t wanted. You are the mo&s;t unlucky rogues&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Well, well, father!" an&s;wered Jacques; "had you been of my mind, all would have been over by this time. You, Robert, Claude, and my&s;elf&mdash;why the &s;trangers were but double the number, and I war|rant you we might have ma&s;tered them. However, Claude is gone; 'tis too late to think of it now. We mu&s;t wait patiently for the arrival of the gang; and, if the travellers e&s;cape us to-night, we mu&s;t take care to waylay them to-morrow."</P>
<P>"True! true!" &s;aid Bapti&s;te, "Marguerite, have you given the &s;leeping draught to the waiting women?"</P>
<P>She replied in the affirmative.</P>
<P>"All then is &s;afe. Come, come, boys; whatever falls out, we have no rea&s;on to complain of this ad|venture. We run no danger, may gain much, and can lo&s;e nothing."</P>
<P>At this moment I heard a trampling of hor&s;es. Oh! how dreadful was the &s;ound to my ears! A cold &s;weat flowed down my forehead, and I felt all the terrors of impending death. I was by no means re|a&s;&s;ured by hearing the compa&s;&s;ionate Marguerite ex|claim, in the accents of de&s;pair, "Almighty God! they are lo&s;t."</P>
<P>Luckily the woodman and his &s;ons were too much occupied by the arrival of their a&s;&s;ociates to attend to
<PB N="136" REF="035729_0134_100658D5BA449488">
me, or the violence of my agitation would have con|vinced them my &s;leep was feigned.</P>
<P>"Open! open!" exclaimed &s;everal voices on the out&s;ide of the cottage.</P>
<P>"Yes! yes!" cried Bapti&s;te joyfully; "they are our friends, &s;ure enough. Now then our booty is certain. Away! lads, away! Lead them to the barn; you know what is to be done there."</P>
<P>Robert ha&s;tened to open the door of the cottage.</P>
<P>"But fir&s;t," &s;aid Jacques, taking up his arms, fir&s;t let me di&s;patch the&s;e &s;leepers."</P>
<P>"No, no, no!" replied his father: "Go you to the barn, where your pre&s;ence is wanted. Leave me to take care of the&s;e and the women above."</P>
<P>Jacques obeyed, and followed his brother. They &s;eemed to conver&s;e with the new comers for a few minutes; after which I heard the robbers di&s;mount, and, as I conjectured, bend their cour&s;e towards the barn.</P>
<P>"So! that is wi&s;ely done!" muttered Bapti&s;te; "they have quitted their hor&s;es, that they may fall upon the &s;trangers by &s;urpri&s;e. Good! good! and now to bu&s;ine&s;s."</P>
<P>I heard him approach a &s;mall cupboard which was fixed up in a di&s;tant part of the room, and unlock it. At this moment I felt my&s;elf &s;haken gently.</P>
<P>"Now! now!" whi&s;pered Marguerite. I opened my eyes. Bapti&s;te &s;tood with his back towards me.
<PB N="137" REF="035729_0135_100658A3F303EFC0">
No one el&s;e was in the room &s;ave Marguerite and the &s;leeping lady. The villain had taken a dagger from the cupboard, and &s;eemed examining whether it was &s;ufficiently &s;harp. I had neglected to furni&s;h my&s;elf with arms; but I perceived this to be my only chance of e&s;caping, and re&s;olved not to lo&s;e the opportunity. I &s;prang from my &s;eat, darted &s;uddenly upon Bapti&s;te, and, cla&s;ping my hands round his throat, pre&s;&s;ed it &s;o forcibly as to prevent his uttering a &s;ingle cry. You may remember that I was remarkable at Salamanca for the power of my arm. It now rendered me an e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice. Surpri&s;ed, terrified, and breathle&s;s, the villain was by no means an equal antagoni&s;t. I threw him upon the ground; I gra&s;ped him &s;till tighter; I fixed him without motion upon the floor, Marguerite, wre&s;ting the dagger from his hand, plung|ed it repeatedly in his heart till he expired.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was this horrible but nece&s;&s;ary act per|petrated, than Marguerite called on me to follow her.</P>
<P>"Flight is our only refuge," &s;aid &s;he; "quick! quick! away!"</P>
<P>I he&s;itated not to obey her; but unwilling to leave the barone&s;s a victim to the vengeance of the robbers, I rai&s;ed her in my arms &s;till &s;leeping, and ha&s;tened after Marguerite. The hor&s;es of the banditti were fa&s;tened near the door. My conductre&s;s &s;prang upon one of them. I followed her example, placed the barone&s;s before me, and &s;purred on my hor&s;e. Our only hope was to reach Stra&s;bourg, which was much nearer than the perfidious Claude had a&s;&s;ured me. Marguerite was well acquainted with the road, and gallopped on before me. We were obliged to pa&s;s by the barn,
<PB N="138" REF="035729_0136_100658A26B264F78">
where the robbers were &s;laughtering our dome&s;tics. The door was open: we di&s;tingui&s;hed the &s;hrieks of the dying, and imprecations of the murderers. What I felt at that moment language is unable to de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>Jacques heard the trampling of our hor&s;es, as we ru&s;hed by the barn. He flew to the door with a burn|ing torch in his hand, and ea&s;ily recogni&s;ed the fugi|tives.</P>
<P>"Betrayed! betrayed!" he &s;houted to his com|panions.</P>
<P>In&s;tantly they left their bloody work, and ha&s;tened to regain their hor&s;es. We heard no more. I buri|ed my &s;purs in the &s;ides of my cour&s;er, and Marguerite goaded on hers with the poignard which had already rendered us &s;uch good &s;ervice. We flew like light|ning, and gained the open plains. Already was Stra&s;|bourg's &s;teeple in &s;ight, when we heard the robbers pur&s;uing us. Marguerite looked back, and di&s;tin|gui&s;hed our followers de&s;cending a &s;mall hill at no great di&s;tance. It was in vain that we urged on our hor&s;es, the noi&s;e approached nearer with every mo|ment.</P>
<P>"We are lo&s;t!" &s;he exclaimed; "the villains gain upon us!"</P>
<P>"On, on!" replied I; "I hear the trampling of hor&s;es coming from the town."</P>
<P>We redoubled our exertions, and were &s;oon aware of a numerous band of cavaliers, who came towards us at full &s;peed. They were on the point of pa&s;&s;ing us.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="035729_0137_100658A7EEC392A8">
"Stay! &s;tay! &s;hrieked Marguerite; "&s;ave us! for God's &s;ake, &s;ave us!"</P>
<P>The foremo&s;t, who &s;eemed to act as guide, immedi|ately reined in his &s;teed.</P>
<P>"'Tis &s;he! 'tis &s;he!" exclaimed he, &s;pringing up|on the ground: "&s;top, my lord, &s;top! they are &s;afe! 'tis my mother!"</P>
<P>At the &s;ame moment Marguerite threw her&s;elf from her hor&s;e, cla&s;ped him in her arms, and covered him with ki&s;&s;es. The other cavaliers &s;topped at the exclamation.</P>
<P>"The barone&s;s Lindenberg?" cried another of the &s;trangers eagerly: "Where is &s;he? Is &s;he not with you?"</P>
<P>He &s;topped on beholding her lying &s;en&s;ele&s;s in my arms. Ha&s;tily he caught her from me. The pro|found &s;leep in which &s;he was plunged, made him at fir&s;t tremble for her life; but the beating of her heart &s;oon rea&s;&s;ured him.</P>
<P>"God be thanked!" &s;aid he, "&s;he has e&s;caped un|hurt."</P>
<P>I interrupted his joy by pointing out the brigands, who continued to approach. No &s;ooner had I men|tioned them, than the greate&s;t part of the company, which appeared to be chiefly compo&s;ed of &s;oldiers, ha&s;tened forward to meet them. The villains &s;taid not to receive their attack. Perceiving their danger, they turned the heads of their hor&s;es, and fled into the wood, whither they were followed by our pre&s;ervers. In the mean while the &s;tranger, whom I gue&s;&s;ed to be
<PB N="140" REF="035729_0138_100658D744E8B6C0">
the baron Lindenberg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> after thanking me for my care of his lady, propo&s;ed our returnin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> with all &s;peed to the town. The barone&s;s, on who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> he effects of the opiate had not cea&s;ed to operate, was placed before him; Marguerite and her &s;on remounted their hor&s;es; the baron's dome&s;tics followed, and we &s;oon arrived at the inn where he had taken his apartments.</P>
<P>This was at the Au&s;trian Eagle, where my banker, whom before my quitting Paris I had apprized of my intention to vi&s;it Stra&s;bourg, had prepared lodgings for me. I rejoiced at this circum&s;tance. It gave me an opportunity of cultivating the baron's acquaintance, which I fore&s;aw would be of u&s;e to me in Germany. Immediately upon our arrival, the lady was conveyed to bed. A phy&s;ician was &s;ent for, who pre&s;cribed a medicine likely to counteract the effects of the &s;leepy potion; and after it had been poured down her throat, &s;he was committed to the care of the ho&s;te&s;s. The baron then addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me, and entreated me to recount the particulars of this adventure. I com|plied with his reque&s;t in&s;tantaneou&s;ly; for, in pain re|&s;pecting Stephano's fate, whom I had been compelled to abandon to the cruelty of the banditti, I found it im|po&s;&s;ible for me to repo&s;e till I had &s;ome news of him. I received but too &s;oon the intelligence that my tru&s;ty &s;ervant had peri&s;hed. The &s;oldiers who had pur&s;ued the brigands, returned while I was employed in relat|ing my adventure to the baron. By their account, I found that the robbers had been overtaken. Guilt and true courage are incompatible: they had thrown them&s;elves at the fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t of their pur&s;uers, had &s;urrender|ed them&s;elves without &s;triking a blow, had di&s;covered their &s;ecret retreat, made known their &s;ignals by which

the re&s;t of the gang might be &s;eized, and, in &s;hort, had betrayed every mark of cowardice and ba&s;ene&s;s. By this means the whole of the band, con&s;i&s;ting of near &s;ixty per&s;ons, had been made pri&s;oners, bound, and conducted to Stra&s;bourg. Some of the &s;oldiers ha&s;tened to the cottage, one of the banditti &s;erving them as guide. Their fir&s;t vi&s;it was to the fatal barn, where they were fortunate enough to find two of the baron's &s;ervants &s;till alive, though de&s;perately wounded. The re&s;t had expired beneath the &s;words of the robbers, and of the&s;e my unhappy Stephano was one.</P>
<P>Alarmed at our e&s;cape, the robbers, in their ha&s;te to overtake us, had neglected to vi&s;it the cottage; in con|&s;equence, the &s;oldiers found <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">wo waiting women unhurt, and buried in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> death like &s;lumber which had overpowered their mi&s;tre&s;s. There was no|body el&s;e found in the cottage, except a child not above four years old, which the &s;oldiers brought away with them. We were bu&s;ying our&s;elves with con|jectures re&s;pecting the birth of this little unfortunate, when Marguerite ru&s;hed into the room with the baby in her arms. She fell at the feet of the officer who was making us this report, and ble&s;&s;ed him a thou&s;and times for the pre&s;ervation of her child.</P>
<P>When the fir&s;t bur&s;t of maternal tenderne&s;s was over, I be&s;ought her to declare by what means &s;he had been united to a man who&s;e principles &s;eemed &s;o to|tally di&s;cordant with her own. She bent her eyes downwards, and wiped a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ew tears from her cheek.</P>
<P>"Gentlemen '&s;aid &s;he, after a &s;ilence of &s;ome min|utes, "I would reque&s;t a favour of you. You have
<PB N="142" REF="035729_0140_100658DB312F4B18">
a right to know on whom you confer an obligation; I will not, therefore, &s;tifle a confe&s;&s;ion which covers me with &s;hame; but permit me to compri&s;e it in as few words as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>"I was born in Stra&s;bourg, of re&s;pectable parents; their names I mu&s;t at pre&s;ent conceal. My father &s;till lives, and de&s;erves not to be involved in my infa|my. If you grant my reque&s;t, you &s;hall be informed of my family name. A villain made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of my affections, and to follow him I quitted my fath|er's hou&s;e. Yet, though my pa&s;&s;ions overpowered my virtue, I &s;unk not into that degeneracy of vice but too commonly the lot of women who make the fir&s;t fal&s;e &s;tep. I loved my &s;educer, dearly loved him! I was true to his bed: this baby, and the youth who warned you, my lord baron, of your lady's danger, are the pledges of our affection. Even at this moment I la|ment his lo&s;s, though 'tis to him that I owe all the mi&s;eries of my exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>"He was of noble birth, but he had &s;quandered away his paternal inheritance. His relations con&s;id|ered him as a di&s;grace to their name, and utterly di&s;|carded him. His exce&s;&s;es drew upon him the indig|nation of the police. He was obliged to fly from Stra&s;bourg; and &s;aw no other re&s;ource from beggary than an union with the banditti who infe&s;ted the neigh|bouring fore&s;t, and who&s;e troop was chiefly compo&s;ed of young men of family in the &s;ame predicament with him&s;elf. I was determined not to for&s;ake him. I followed him to the cavern of the brigands, and &s;hared with him the mi&s;ery in&s;eparable from a life of pillage. But though I was aware that our exi&s;tence was &s;up|ported
<PB N="143" REF="035729_0141_100658AB14A3E3C8">
by plunder, I knew not all the horrible circum|&s;tances attached to my lover's profe&s;&s;ion: the&s;e he concealed from me with the utmo&s;t care. He was con&s;cious that my &s;entiments were not &s;ufficiently depraved to look without horror upon a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. He &s;uppo&s;ed, and with ju&s;tice, that I &s;hould fly with dete&s;tation from the embraces of a murderer. Eight years of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion had not abated his love for me: and he cautiou&s;ly removed from my knowledge every circum&s;tance which might lead me to &s;u&s;pect the crimes in which he but too often participated. He &s;ucceeded perfectly. It was not till after my &s;edu|cer's death that I di&s;covered his hands to have been &s;tained with the blood of innocence.</P>
<P>"One fatal night he was brought back to the cav|ern, covered with wounds: he received them in at|tacking an Engli&s;h traveller, whom his companions immediately &s;acrificed to their re&s;entment. He had only time to entreat my pardon for all the &s;orrows which he had cau&s;ed me: he pre&s;&s;ed my hand to his lips, and expired. My grief was inexpre&s;&s;ible. As &s;oon as its violence abated, I re&s;olved to return to Stra&s;bourg, to throw my&s;elf, with my two children, at my father's feet, and implore his forgivene&s;s, though I little hoped to obtain it. What was my con&s;terna|tion when informed, that no one entru&s;ted with the &s;ecret of their retreat was ever permitted to quit the troop of the banditti; that I mu&s;t give up all hopes of ever rejoining &s;ociety, and con&s;ent in&s;tantly to accept one of their band for my hu&s;band! My prayers and remon&s;trances were vain. They ca&s;t lots to decide to who&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion I &s;hould fall. I became the proper|ty of the infamous Bapti&s;te. A robber, who had
<PB N="144" REF="035729_0142_100658DCB7BD12D0">
once been a monk, pronounced over us a burle&s;que rather than a religious ceremony: I and my children were delivered into the hands of my new hu&s;band, and he conveyed us immediately to his home.</P>
<P>"He a&s;&s;ured me that he had long entertained for me the mo&s;t ardent regard; but that friend&s;hip for my decea&s;ed lover had obliged him to &s;tifle his de&s;ires. He endeavoured to reconcile me to my fate, and for &s;ome time treated me with re&s;pect and gentlene&s;s. At length, finding that my aver&s;ion rather increa&s;ed than dimini&s;hed, he obtained tho&s;e favours by violence which I per&s;i&s;ted to refu&s;e him. No re&s;ource re|mained for me but to bear my &s;orrows with patience: I was con&s;cious that I de&s;erved them but too well. Flight was forbidden. My children were in the power of Bapti&s;te; and he had &s;worn, that if I at|tempted to e&s;cape, their lives &s;hould pay for it. I had had too many opportunities of witne&s;&s;ing the barbarity of his nature, to doubt his fulfilling his oath to the very letter. Sad experience had convinced me of the hor|rors of my &s;ituation. My fir&s;t lover had carefully concealed them from me; Bapti&s;te rather rejoiced in opening my eyes to the cruelties of his profe&s;&s;ion, and &s;trove to familiarize me with blood and &s;laughter.</P>
<P>"My nature was licentious and warm, but not cruel: my conduct had been imprudent, but my heart was not unprincipled. Judge, then, what I mu&s;t have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> at being a continual witne&s;s of crimes the mo&s;t horrible and revolting! Judge how I mu&s;t have griev|ed at being united to a man, who received the un&s;u&s;|pecting gue&s;t with an air of openne&s;s and ho&s;pitality, at the very moment that he meditated his de&s;truction!
<PB N="145" REF="035729_0143_100658ACC7F3FED8">
Chagrin and di&s;content preyed upon my con&s;titution; the few charms be&s;towed on me by nature withered away, and the dejection of my countenance denoted the &s;ufferings of my heart. I was tempted a thou&s;and times to put an end to my exi&s;tence; but the remem|brance of my children held my hand. I trembled to leave my dear boys in my tyrant's power, and trem|bled yet more for their virtue than their lives. The &s;econd was &s;till too young to benefit by my in&s;truc|tions; but in the heart of my elde&s;t I laboured uncea&s;|ingly to plant tho&s;e principles which might enable him to avoid the crimes of his parents. He li&s;tened to me with docility, or rather with eagerne&s;s. Even at is early age, he &s;hewed that he was not calculated for the &s;ociety of villains; and the only comfort which I en|joyed among my &s;orrows, was to witne&s;s the dawning virtues of my Theodore.</P>
<P>"Such was my &s;ituation when the perfidy of Don Alphon&s;o's po&s;tillion conducted him to the cottage. His youth, air, and manners intere&s;ted me mo&s;t forci|bly in his behalf. The ab&s;ence of my hu&s;band's &s;ons gave me an opportunity which I had long wi&s;hed to find, and I re&s;olved to ri&s;k every thing to pre&s;erve the &s;tranger. The vigilance of Bapti&s;te prevented me from warning Don Alphon&s;o of his danger. I knew that my betraying the &s;ecret would be immediately puni&s;hed with death; and however embittered was my life by calamities, I wanted courage to &s;acrifice it for the &s;ake of pre&s;erving that of another per&s;on. My only hope re&s;ted upon procuring &s;uccour from Stra&s;|bourg. At this I re&s;olved to try; and &s;hould an op|portunity offer of warning Don Alphon&s;o of his dan|ger unob&s;erved, I was determined to &s;eize it with
<PB N="146" REF="035729_0144_100658DE5EBD2400">
avidity. By Bapti&s;te's orders I went up &s;tairs to make the &s;tranger's bed: I &s;pread upon it &s;heets in which a traveller had been murdered but a few nights before, and which &s;till were &s;tained with blood. I hoped that the&s;e marks would not e&s;cape the vigilance of our gue&s;t, and that he would collect from them the de&s;igns of my perfidious hu&s;band. Neither was this the only &s;tep which I took to pre&s;erve the &s;tranger. Theo|dore was confined to his bed by illne&s;s. I &s;tole into his room unob&s;erved by my tyrant, communicated to him my project, and he entered into it with eagerne&s;s. He ro&s;e in &s;pite of his malady, and dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with all &s;peed. I fa&s;tened one of the &s;heets round his arms, and lowered him from the window. He flew to the &s;table, took Claude's hor&s;e, and ha&s;tened to Stra&s;bourg. Had he been acco&s;ted by the banditti, he was to have declared him&s;elf &s;ent upon a me&s;&s;age by Bapti&s;te; but fortunately he reached the town with|out meeting any ob&s;tacle. Immediately upon his ar|rival at Stra&s;bourg, he entreated a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the magi&s;trate: his &s;tory pa&s;&s;ed from mouth to mouth, and at length came to the knowledge of my lord the baron. Anxious for the &s;afety of his lady, who he knew would be upon the road that evening, it &s;truck him that &s;he might have fallen into the power of the robbers. He accompanied Theodore, who guided the &s;oldiers towards the cottage, and arrived ju&s;t in time to &s;ave us from falling once more into the hands of our enemies."</P>
<P>Here I interrupted Marguerite to inquire why the &s;leepy potion had been pre&s;ented to me. She &s;aid that Bapti&s;te &s;uppo&s;ed me to have arms about me, and wi&s;hed to incapacitate me from making re&s;i&s;tance: it
<PB N="147" REF="035729_0145_100658B0989D29A8">
was a precaution which he always took, &s;ince, as the travellers had no hopes of e&s;caping, de&s;pair would have incited them to &s;ell their lives dearly.</P>
<P>The Baron then de&s;ired Marguerite to inform him what were her pre&s;ent plans. I joined him in declar|ing my readine&s;s to &s;how my gratitude to her for the pre&s;ervation of my life.</P>
<P>"Di&s;gu&s;ted with the world," &s;he replied, "in which I have met nothing but misfortunes, my only wi&s;h is to retire into a convent. But fir&s;t I mu&s;t pro|vide for my children. I find that my mother is no more&mdash;probably driven to an untimely grave by my de&s;ertion. My father is &s;till living. He is not an hard man. Perhaps, gentlemen, in &s;pite of my in|gratitude and imprudence, your interce&s;&s;ions may in|duce him to forgive me, and to take charge of his unfortunate grand-&s;ons. If you obtain this boon for me, you will repay my &s;ervices a thou&s;and fold."</P>
<P>Both the baron and my&s;elf a&s;&s;ured Marguerite, that we would &s;pare no pains to obtain her pardon; and that, even &s;hould her father be inflexible, &s;he need be under no apprehen&s;ions re&s;pecting the fate of her chil|dren. I engaged my&s;elf to provide for Theodore, and the baron promi&s;ed to take the younge&s;t under his pro|tection. The grateful mother thanked us with tears for what &s;he called genero&s;ity, but which in fact was no more than a proper &s;en&s;e of our obligations to her. She then left the room to put her little boy to bed, whom fatigue and &s;leep had completely overpowered.</P>
<P>The barone&s;s, on recovering, and being informed from what dangers I had re&s;cued her, &s;et no bounds
<PB N="148" REF="035729_0146_100658DFEB81AA30">
to the expre&s;&s;ions of her gratitude. She was joined &s;o warmly by her hu&s;band in pre&s;&s;ing me to accompany them to their ca&s;tle in Bavaria, that I found it impo&s;&s;i|ble to re&s;i&s;t their entreaties. During a week which we pa&s;&s;ed at Stra&s;bourg, the intere&s;ts of Marguerite were not forgotten. In our application to her father we &s;ucceeded as amply as we could wi&s;h. The good old man had lo&s;t his wife. He had no children but this unfortunate daughter, of whom he had received no news for almo&s;t fourteen years. He was &s;urrounded by di&s;tant relations, who waited with impatience for his decea&s;e, in order to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his money. When therefore Marguerite appeared again &s;o unex|pectedly, he con&s;idered her as a gift from Heaven. He received her and her children with open arms, and in|&s;i&s;ted upon their e&s;tabli&s;hing them&s;elves in his hou&s;e without delay. The di&s;appointed cou&s;ins were ob|liged to give place. The old man would not hear of his daughter's retiring into a convent. He &s;aid, that &s;he was too nece&s;&s;ary to his happine&s;s, and &s;he was ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to relinqui&s;h her de&s;igns. But no per&s;ua&s;ions could induce Theodore to give up the plan which I had at fir&s;t marked out for him. He had attached him&s;elf to me mo&s;t &s;incerely during my &s;tay at Stra&s;bourg; and when I was on the point of leav|ing it, he be&s;ought me with tears to take him into my &s;ervice. He &s;et forth all his little talents in the mo&s;t favourable colours, and tried to convince me that I &s;hould find him of infinite u&s;e to me upon the road. I was unwilling to charge my&s;elf with a lad &s;carcely turned of thirteen, who I knew could only be a bur|then to me: however, I could not re&s;i&s;t the entreaties of this affectionate youth, who in fact po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a thou|&s;and
<PB N="149" REF="035729_0147_100658B2211ACAE0">
e&s;timable qualities. With &s;ome difficulty he per|&s;uaded his relations to let him follow me; and that permi&s;&s;ion once obtained, he was dubbed with the title of my page. Having pa&s;&s;ed a week at Stra&s;bourg, Theodore and my&s;elf &s;et out for Bavaria, in company with the baron and his lady. The&s;e latter, as well as my&s;elf, had forced Marguerite to accept &s;everal pre&s;|ents of value, both for her&s;elf and her younge&s;t &s;on. On leaving her, I promi&s;ed his mother faithfully, that I would re&s;tore Theodore to her within the year.</P>
<P>I have related this adventure at length, Lorenzo, that you might under&s;tand the means by which "the adventurer Alphon&s;o d'Alvarada got introduced into the ca&s;tle of Lindenberg." Judge from this &s;pecimen, how much faith &s;hould be given to your aunt's a&s;&s;er|tions.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<HEAD>CONTINUATION OF THE HISTORY OF DON RAYMOND.</HEAD>
<P>MY journey was uncommonly agreeable. I found the baron a man of &s;ome &s;en&s;e, but little know|ledge of the world. He had pa&s;&s;ed a great part of his life without &s;tirring beyond the precincts of his own domains, and con&s;equently his manners were far from being the mo&s;t poli&s;hed; but he was hearty, good hu|moured, and friendly. His attention to me was all that I could wi&s;h, and I had every rea&s;on to be &s;atis|fied with his behaviour. His ruling pa&s;&s;ion was hunt|ing, which he had brought him&s;elf to con&s;ider as a &s;erious occupation; and, when talking over &s;ome remarkable chace, he treated the &s;ubject with as much gravity as if it had been a battle on which the fate of two kingdoms was depending. I happened to be a tolerable &s;port&s;man: &s;oon after my arrival at Lin|denberg, I gave &s;ome proofs of my dexterity. The baron immediately marked me down for a man of ge|nius, and vowed to me an eternal friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>That friend&s;hip was become to me by no means in|different. At the ca&s;tle of Lindenberg, I beheld for the fir&s;t time your &s;i&s;ter, the lovely Agnes. For me, who&s;e heart was unoccupied, and who grieved at the void, to &s;ee her and to love her were the &s;ame. I found
<PB N="151" REF="035729_0149_10065918F69918B8">
in Agnes all that was requi&s;ite to &s;ecure my affection. She was then &s;carcely &s;ixteen; her per&s;on, light and elegant, was already formed; &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;everal tal|ents in perfection, particularly tho&s;e of mu&s;ic and drawing: her character was gay, open, and good hu|moured; and the graceful &s;implicity of her dre&s;s and manners formed an advantageous contra&s;t to the art and &s;tudied coquetry of the Pari&s;ian dames, whom I had ju&s;t quitted. From the moment that I beheld her, I felt the mo&s;t lively intere&s;t in her fate. I made many inquiries re&s;pecting her of the barone&s;s.</P>
<P>"She is my niece," replied that lady. "You are &s;till ignorant, Don Alphon&s;o, that I am your country|woman. I am &s;i&s;ter to the duke of Medina Celi. Agnes is the daughter of my &s;econd brother, Don Ga&s;|ton: &s;he has been de&s;tined to the convent from her cradle, and will &s;oon make her profe&s;&s;ion at Madrid."</P>
<P>[Here Lorenzo interrupted the marquis by an ex|clamation of &s;urpri&s;e&mdash;</P>
<P>"Intended for the convent from her cradle!" &s;aid he: "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">, this is the fir&s;t word that I ever heard of &s;uch a de&s;ign."</P>
<P>"I believe it, my dear Lorenzo," an&s;wered Don Raymond; "but you mu&s;t li&s;ten to me with patience. You will not be le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed, when I relate &s;ome par|ticulars of your family &s;till unknown to you, and which I have learned from the mouth of Agnes her&s;elf."</P>
<P>He then re&s;umed his narrative as follows:]</P>
<P>You cannot but be aware, that your parents were unfortunately &s;laves to the gro&s;&s;e&s;t &s;uper&s;tition: when
<PB N="152" REF="035729_0150_100658E5678704C0">
this foible was called into play, their every other &s;en|timent, their every other pa&s;&s;ion, yielded to its irre&s;i&s;t|ible &s;trength. While &s;he was big with Agnes, your mother was &s;eized by a dangerous illne&s;s, and given over by her phy&s;icians. In this &s;ituation Donna In|e&s;illa vowed, that if &s;he recovered from her malady, the child then living in her bo&s;om, if a girl, &s;hould be dedicated to St. Clare; if a boy, to St. Benedict. Her prayers were heard: &s;he got rid of her complaint; Agnes entered the world alive, and was immediately de&s;tined to the &s;ervice of St. Clare.</P>
<P>Don Ga&s;ton readily chimed in with his lady's wi&s;hes; but knowing the &s;entiments of the duke, his brother, re&s;pecting a mona&s;tic life, it was determined that your &s;i&s;ter's de&s;tination &s;hould be carefully concealed from him. The better to guard the &s;ecret, it was re|&s;olved that Agnes &s;hould accompany her aunt, Donna Rodolpha, into Germany, whither that lady was on the point of following her new married hu&s;band, baron Lindenberg. On her arrival at that e&s;tate, the young Agnes was put into a convent, &s;ituated but a few miles from the ca&s;tle. The nuns, to whom her education was confided, performed their charge with exactitude: they made her a perfect mi&s;tre&s;s of many accompli&s;h|ments, and &s;trove to infu&s;e into her mind a ta&s;te for the retirement and tranquil plea&s;ures of a convent. But a &s;ecret in&s;tinct made the young reclu&s;e &s;en&s;ible that &s;he was not born for &s;olitude: in all the freedom of youth and gaiety, &s;he &s;crupled not to treat as ridicu|lous many ceremonies which the nuns regarded with awe: and &s;he was never more happy than when her lively imagination in&s;pired her with &s;ome &s;cheme to plague the &s;tiff lady abbe&s;s, or the ugly ill tempered
<PB N="153" REF="035729_0151_1006591A82884508">
old portere&s;s. She looked with di&s;gu&s;t upon the pro&s;|pect before her: however, no alternative was offered to her, and &s;he &s;ubmitted to the decree of her parents, though not without &s;ecret repining.</P>
<P>That repugnance &s;he had not art enough to conceal long: Don Ga&s;ton was informed of it. Alarmed, Lorenzo, le&s;t your affection for her &s;hould oppo&s;e it|&s;elf to his projects, and le&s;t you &s;hould po&s;itively object to your &s;i&s;ter's mi&s;ery, he re&s;olved to keep the whole affair from <HI>your</HI> knowledge as well as the duke's, till the &s;acrifice &s;hould be con&s;ummated. The &s;ea&s;on for her taking the veil was fixed for the time when you &s;hould be upon your travels: in the mean while, no hint was dropped of Donna Ine&s;illa's fatal vow. Your &s;i&s;ter was never permitted to know your direction. All your letters were read before &s;he received them, and tho&s;e parts effaced which were likely to nouri&s;h her inclination for the world: her an&s;wers were dic|tated either by her aunt, or by dame Cunegonda, her governe&s;s. The&s;e particulars I learnt partly from Agnes, partly from the barone&s;s her&s;elf.</P>
<P>I immediately determined upon re&s;cuing this lovely girl from a fate &s;o contrary to her inclinations, and ill &s;uited to her merit. I endeavoured to ingratiate my|&s;elf into her favour: I boa&s;ted of my friend&s;hip and intimacy with you. She li&s;tened to me with avidity; &s;he &s;eemed to devour my words while I &s;poke in your prai&s;e, and her eyes thanked me for my affection to her brother. My con&s;tant and unremitted attention at length gained me her heart, and with difficulty I oblig|ed her to confe&s;s that &s;he loved me. When, however, I propo&s;ed her quitting the ca&s;tle of Lindenberg, &s;he rejected the idea in po&s;itive terms.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="035729_0152_100658E6F010A060">
"Be generous, Alphon&s;o," &s;he &s;aid; "you po&s;&s;e&s;s my heart, but u&s;e not the gift ignobly. Employ not your a&s;cendancy over me in per&s;uading me to take a &s;tep at which I &s;hould hereafter have to blu&s;h. I am young and de&s;erted: my brother, my only friend, is &s;eparated from me, and my other relations act with me as my enemies. Take pity on my unprotected &s;ituation. In&s;tead of &s;educing me to an action which would cover me with &s;hame, &s;trive rather to gain the affections of tho&s;e who govern me. The baron e&s;|teems you. My aunt, to others ever har&s;h, proud, and contemptuous, remembers that you re&s;cued her from the hands of murderers, and wears with you alone the appearance of kindne&s;s and benignity. Try then your influence over my guardians. If they con|&s;ent to our union, my hand is yours. From your ac|count of my brother, I cannot doubt your obtaining his approbation; and when they find the impo&s;&s;ibility of executing their de&s;ign, I tru&s;t that my parents will excu&s;e my di&s;obedience, and expiate by &s;ome other &s;acrifice my mother's fatal vow."</P>
<P>From the fir&s;t moment that I beheld Agnes, I had endeavoured to conciliate the favour of her relations. Authorized by the confe&s;&s;ion of her regard, I redoubled my exertions. My principal battery was directed again&s;t the barone&s;s. It was ea&s;y to di&s;cover that her word was law in the ca&s;tle: her hu&s;band paid her the mo&s;t ab&s;olute &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and con&s;idered her as a &s;u|perior being. She was about forty. In her youth &s;he had been a beauty; but her charms had been upon that large &s;cale which can but ill &s;u&s;tain the &s;hock of years: however, &s;he &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> of them. Her under&s;tanding was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> excellent

when not ob&s;cured by prejudice, which unluckily was but &s;eldom the ca&s;e. Her pa&s;&s;ions were violent: &s;he &s;pared no pains to gratify them, and pur&s;ued with unremitting vengeance tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed them|&s;elves to her wi&s;hes. The warme&s;t of friends, the mo&s;t inveterate of enemies, &s;uch was the barone&s;s Lindenberg.</P>
<P>I laboured ince&s;&s;antly to plea&s;e her: unluckily I &s;ucceeded but too well. She &s;eemed gratified by my attention, and treated me with a di&s;tinction accorded by her to no one el&s;e. One of my daily occupations was reading to her for &s;everal hours: tho&s;e hours I &s;hould much rather have pa&s;&s;ed with Agnes; but as I was con&s;cious that complai&s;ance for her aunt would advance our union, I &s;ubmitted with a good grace to the penance impo&s;ed upon me. Donna Rodolpha's library was principally compo&s;ed of old Spani&s;h ro|mances: the&s;e were her favourite &s;tudies, and once a day one of the&s;e unmerciful volumes was put regu|larly into my hands. I read the weari&s;ome adven|tures of "<HI>Percefore&s;t," "Tirante the White," "Pal|merin of England,"</HI> and "<HI>The Knight of the Sun,</HI>" till the book was on the point of falling from my hands through ennui. However, the increa&s;ing plea&s;ure which the barone&s;s &s;eemed to take in my &s;ociety en|couraged me to per&s;evere; and latterly &s;he &s;howed for me a partiality &s;o marked, that Agnes advi&s;ed me to &s;eize the fir&s;t opportunity of declaring our mutual pa&s;&s;ion to her aunt.</P>
<P>One evening I was alone with Donna Rodolpha, in her own apartment. As our readings generally treated of love, Agnes was never permitted to a&s;&s;i&s;t at
<PB N="156" REF="035729_0154_100658EC70DA9F50">
them. I was ju&s;t congratulating my&s;elf on having fini&s;hed <HI>The Loves of Tri&s;tan and the Queen I&s;eult</HI>&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Ah! the unfortunates!" cried the barone&s;s: "How &s;ay you, Segnor? Do you think it po&s;&s;ible for man to feel an attachment &s;o di&s;intere&s;ted and &s;in|cere?"</P>
<P>"I cannot doubt it," replied I; "my own heart furni&s;hes me with the certainty. Ah! Donna Ro|dolpha, might I but hope for your approbation of my love! might I but confe&s;s the name of my mi&s;tre&s;s, without incurring your re&s;entment!"</P>
<P>She interrupted me&mdash;</P>
<P>"Suppo&s;e I were to &s;pare you that confe&s;&s;ion? Suppo&s;e I were to acknowledge that the object of your de&s;ires is not unknown to me? Suppo&s;e I were to &s;ay, that &s;he returns your affection, and laments not le&s;s &s;incerely than your&s;elf the unhappy vows which &s;eparate her from you?"</P>
<P>"Ah! Donna Rodolpha!" I exclaimed, throwing my&s;elf upon my knees before her, and pre&s;&s;ing her hand to my lips, "you have di&s;covered my &s;ecret! What is your deci&s;ion? Mu&s;t I de&s;pair, or may I reckon upon your favour?"</P>
<P>She withdrew not the hand which I held; but &s;he turned from me, and covered her face with the other.</P>
<P>"How can I refu&s;e it you?" &s;he replied: "Ah! Don Alphon&s;o, I have long perceived to whom your attentions were directed, but till now I perceived not the impre&s;&s;ion which they had made upon my heart. At length I can no longer hide my weakne&s;s either
<PB N="157" REF="035729_0155_100658E8A2C36DE8">
from my&s;elf or from you. I yield to the violence of my pa&s;&s;ion, and own that I adore you! For three long months I &s;tifled my de&s;ires; but growing &s;trong|er by re&s;i&s;tance, I &s;ubmit to their impetuo&s;ity. Pride, fear, and honor, re&s;pect for my&s;elf, and my engage|ments to the baron, all are vanqui&s;hed. I &s;acrifice them to my love for you, and it &s;till &s;eems to me that I pay too mean a price for your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>"She pau&s;ed for an an&s;wer.&mdash;Judge, my Lorenzo, what mu&s;t have been my confu&s;ion at this di&s;covery. I at once &s;aw all the magnitude of this ob&s;tacle, which I had my&s;elf rai&s;ed to my happine&s;s. The barone&s;s had placed tho&s;e attentions to her own account, which I had merely paid her for the &s;ake of Agnes: and the &s;trength of her expre&s;&s;ions, the looks which accom|panied them, and my knowledge of her revengeful di&s;po&s;ition, made me tremble for my&s;elf and my be|loved. I was &s;ilent for &s;ome minutes. I knew not how to reply to her declaration: I could only re&s;olve to clear up the mi&s;take without delay, and for the pre&s;ent to conceal from her knowledge the name of my mi&s;tre&s;s. No &s;ooner had &s;he avowed her pa&s;&s;ion, than the tran&s;ports which before were evident in my features gave place to con&s;ternation and con&s;traint. I dropped her hand, and ro&s;e from my knees. The change in my countenance did not e&s;cape her ob|&s;ervation.</P>
<P>"What means this &s;ilence?" &s;aid &s;he in a trem|bling voice: Where is that joy which you led me to expect?"</P>
<P>"Forgive me, Segnora," I an&s;wered, "if what nece&s;&s;ity forces from me &s;hould &s;eem har&s;h and un|grateful.

grateful. To encourage you in an error, which, how|ever, it may flatter my&s;elf, mu&s;t prove to you the &s;ource of di&s;appointment, would make me appear criminal in every eye. Honor obliges me to inform you, that you have mi&s;taken for the &s;olicitude of love what was only the attention of friend&s;hip. The lat|ter &s;entiment is that which I wi&s;hed to excite in your bo&s;om: to entertain a warmer, re&s;pect for you for|bids me, and gratitude for the baron's generous treat|ment. Perhaps the&s;e rea&s;ons would not be &s;ufficient to &s;hield me from your attractions, were it not that my affections are already be&s;towed upon another. You have charms, Segnora, which might captivate the mo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible; no heart unoccupied could re&s;i&s;t them. Happy is it for me, that mine is no longer in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or I &s;hould have to reproach my&s;elf for ever, with having violated the laws of ho&s;pitality, Recollect your&s;elf, noble lady! recollect what is owed by you to honor, by me to the baron, and replace by e&s;teem and friend&s;hip tho&s;e &s;entiments which I never can return."</P>
<P>The barone&s;s turned pale at this unexpected and po&s;itive declaration; &s;he doubted whether &s;he &s;lept or woke. At length recovering from her &s;urpri&s;e, con|&s;ternation gave place to rage, and the blood ru&s;hed back in her cheeks with violence.</P>
<P>"Villain!" &s;he cried; "Mon&s;ter of deceit! Thus is the avowal of my love received? Is it thus that&mdash;but, no, no! it cannot, it &s;hall not be! Al|phon&s;o, behold me at your feet?

<P>I prepared to quit the apartment: the barone&s;s caught me &s;uddenly by the arm.</P>
<P>"And who is this happy rival?" &s;aid &s;he in a men|acing tone; "I will know her name, and <HI>when</HI> I know it!&mdash;She is &s;ome one in my power; you en|treated my favour, my protection!

<P>As &s;he uttered the&s;e la&s;t words, her fury mounted to &s;uch a pitch as to &s;top her powers of re&s;piration. She panted, groaned, and at length fainted away. As &s;he was falling I caught her in my arms, and placed her upon a &s;ofa. Then ha&s;tening to the door, I &s;ummoned her women to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance; I committed her to their care, and &s;eized the opportunity of e&s;|caping.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="035729_0158_100658EF8637F6F8">
Agitated and confu&s;ed beyond expre&s;&s;ion, I bent my &s;teps towards the garden. The benignity with which the barone&s;s had li&s;tened to me at fir&s;t, had rai&s;ed my hopes to the highe&s;t pitch: I imagined her to have perceived my attachment for her niece, and to approve of it. Extreme was my di&s;appointment at under&s;tanding the true purport of her di&s;cour&s;e. I knew not what cour&s;e to take: the &s;uper&s;tition of the parents of Agnes, aided by her aunt's unfortunate pa&s;&s;ion, &s;eemed to oppo&s;e &s;uch ob&s;tacles to our union as were almo&s;t in&s;urmountable.</P>
<P>As I pa&s;&s;ed by a low parlour, who&s;e windows looked into the garden, through the door which &s;tood half open I ob&s;erved Agnes &s;eated at a table. She was occupied in drawing, and &s;everal unfini&s;hed &s;ketches were &s;cattered round her. I entered, &s;till un|determined whether I &s;hould acquaint her with the declaration of the barone&s;s.</P>
<P>"Oh! is it only you?" &s;aid &s;he, rai&s;ing her head: "You are no &s;tranger, and I &s;hall continue my occu|pation without ceremony. Take a chair, and &s;eat your&s;elf by me."</P>
<P>I obeyed, and placed my&s;elf near the table. Un|con&s;cious what I was doing, and totally occupied by the &s;cene which had ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed, I took up &s;ome of the drawings, and ca&s;t my eyes over them. One of the &s;ubjects &s;truck me from its &s;ingularity. It repre|&s;ented the great hall of the ca&s;tle of Lindenberg. A door conducting to a narrow &s;tairca&s;e &s;tood half open. In the foreground appeared a group of figures, placed in the mo&s;t grote&s;que attitudes; terror was expre&s;&s;ed upon every countenance. Here was one upon his
<PB N="161" REF="035729_0159_1006592159B223E8">
knees, with his eyes ca&s;t up to heaven, and praying mo&s;t devoutly; there, another was creeping away upon all fours. Some hid their faces in their cloaks, or the laps of their companions. Some had con|cealed them&s;elves beneath a table, on which the rem|nants of a fea&s;t were vi&s;ible; while others, with gap|ing mouths and eyes wide &s;tretched, pointed to a fig|ure &s;uppo&s;ed to have created this di&s;turbance. It re|pre&s;ented a female of more than human &s;tature, cloth|ed in the habit of &s;ome religious order. Her face was veiled; on her arm hung a chaplet of beads; her dre&s;s was in &s;everal places &s;tained with the blood which trickled from a wound upon her bo&s;om. In one hand &s;he held a lamp, in the other a large knife, and &s;he &s;eemed advancing towards the iron gates of the hall.</P>
<P>"What does this mean, Agnes?" &s;aid I: "Is this &s;ome invention of your own?"</P>
<P>She ca&s;t her eyes upon the drawing.</P>
<P>"Oh! no," &s;he replied: "'tis the invention of much wi&s;er heads than mine. But can you po&s;&s;ibly have lived at Lindenberg for three whole months with|out hearing of the bleeding nun?"</P>
<P>"You are the fir&s;t who ever mentioned the name to me. Pray, who may the lady be?"</P>
<P>"That is more than I can pretend to tell you. All my knowledge of her hi&s;tory comes from an old tra|dition in this family, which has been handed down from father to &s;on, and is firmly credited throughout the baron's domain's. Nay, the baron believes it him|&s;elf; and as for my aunt, who has a natural turn for
<PB N="162" REF="035729_0160_100658F124C55098">
the marvellous, &s;he would &s;ooner doubt the veracity of the bible than of the bleeding nun. Shall I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ell you this hi&s;tory?"</P>
<P>I an&s;wered, that &s;he would oblige me much by re|lating it: &s;he re&s;umed her drawing, and then pro|ceeded as follows in a tone of burle&s;qued gravity:</P>
<P>"It is &s;urpri&s;ing that in all the chronicles of pa&s;t times this remarkable per&s;onage is never once men|tioned. Fain would I recount to you her life; but unluckily till after her death &s;he was never known to have exi&s;ted. Then fir&s;t did &s;he think it nece&s;&s;ary to make &s;ome noi&s;e in the world, and with that intention &s;he made bold to &s;eize upon the ca&s;tle of Lindenberg. Having a good ta&s;te, &s;he took up her abode in the be&s;t room of the hou&s;e; and once e&s;tabli&s;hed there, &s;he be|gan to amu&s;e her&s;elf by knocking about the tables and chairs in the middle of the night. Perhaps &s;he was a bad &s;leeper, but this I have never been able to a&s;cer|tain. According to the tradition, this entertainment commenced about a century ago. It was accompan|ied with &s;hrieking, howling, groaning, &s;wearing, and many other agreeable noi&s;es of the &s;ame kind. But though one particular room was more e&s;pecially hon|oured with her vi&s;its, &s;he did not entirely confine her|&s;elf to it. She occa&s;ionally ventured into the old gal|leries, paced up and down the &s;pacious halls; or, &s;ometimes &s;topping at the doors of the chambers, &s;he wept and wailed there to the univer&s;al terror of the inhabitants. In the&s;e nocturnal excur&s;ions &s;he was &s;een by different people, who all de&s;cribe her appear|ance as you behold it here traced by the hand of her unworthy hi&s;torian."</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="035729_0161_10065923107DA248">
The &s;ingularity of this account in&s;en&s;ibly engaged my attention.</P>
<P>"Did &s;he never &s;peak to tho&s;e who met her?" &s;aid I.</P>
<P>"Not &s;he. The &s;pecimens indeed which &s;he gave nightly of her talents for conver&s;ation were by no means inviting. Sometimes the ca&s;tle rung with oaths and execrations: a moment after &s;he repeated her <HI>Paterno&s;ter:</HI> now &s;he howled out the mo&s;t horrible bla&s;phemies, and then chanted <HI>De profundis</HI> as orderly as if &s;till in the choir. In &s;hort, &s;he &s;eemed a migh|ty capricious being: but whether &s;he prayed or cur&s;|ed, whether &s;he was impious or devout, &s;he al|ways contrived to terrify her auditors out of their &s;en&s;es. The ca&s;tle became &s;carcely habitable; and its lord was &s;o frightened by the&s;e midnight revels, that one fine morning he was &s;ound dead in his bed. This &s;ucce&s;s &s;eemed to plea&s;e the nun mightily, for now &s;he made more noi&s;e than ever. But the next baron proved too cunning for her. He made his ap|pearance with a celebrated exorci&s;er in his hand, who feared not to &s;hut him&s;elf up for a night in the haunted chamber. There it &s;eems that he had a hard battle with the gho&s;t before &s;he would promi&s;e to be quiet. She was ob&s;tinate, but he was more &s;o; and at length &s;he con&s;ented to let the inhabitants of the ca&s;tle take a good night's re&s;t. For &s;ome time after no news was heard of her. But at the end of five years the exor|ci&s;er died, and then the nun ventured to peep abroad again. However, &s;he was now grown much more tractable and well behaved. She walked about in &s;i|lence, and never made her appearance above once in five years. This cu&s;tom, if you will believe the baron,
<PB N="164" REF="035729_0162_100658F4FB27DC20">
&s;he &s;till continues. He is fully per&s;uaded, that on the fifth of May of every fifth year, as &s;oon as the clock &s;trikes one, the door of the haunted chamber opens. [Ob&s;erve, that this room has been &s;hut up for near a century.] Then out walks the gho&s;tly nun with her lamp and dagger: &s;he de&s;cends the &s;tairca&s;e of the ea&s;tern tower, and cro&s;&s;es the great hall. On that night the porter always leaves the gates of the ca&s;tle open, out of re&s;pect to the apparition: not that this is thought by any means nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ince &s;he could ea&s;ily whip through the keyhole if &s;he cho&s;e it: but merely out of politene&s;s, and to prevent her from making her exit in a way &s;o derogatory to the dignity of her gho&s;t|&s;hip."</P>
<P>"And whither does &s;he go on quitting the ca&s;tle?"</P>
<P>"To heaven, I hope; but if &s;he does, the place certainly is not to her ta&s;te, for &s;he always returns after an hour's ab&s;ence. The lady then retires to her chamber, and is quiet for another five years."</P>
<P>"And you, believe this, Agnes?"</P>
<P>"How can you a&s;k &s;uch a que&s;tion? No, no, Al|phon&s;o! I have too much rea&s;on to lament &s;uper&s;ti|tion's influence to be its victim my&s;elf. However, I mu&s;t not avow my incredulity to the barone&s;s: &s;he entertains not a doubt of the truth of this hi&s;tory. As to dame Cunegonda, my governe&s;s, &s;he prote&s;ts that fifteen years ago &s;he &s;aw the &s;pectre with her own eyes. She related to me one evening, how &s;he and &s;everal other dome&s;tics had been terrified while at &s;up|per by the appearance of the bleeding nun, as the gho&s;t is called in the ca&s;tle: 'tis from her account that I drew this &s;ketch, and you may be certain that
<PB N="165" REF="035729_0163_10065924B4D1C638">
Cunegonda was not omitted. There &s;he is! I &s;hall never forget what a pa&s;&s;ion &s;he was in, and how ugly &s;he looked while &s;he &s;colded me for having made her picture &s;o like her&s;elf!"</P>
<P>Here &s;he pointed to a burle&s;que figure of an old woman in an attitude of terror.</P>
<P>In &s;pite of the melancholy which oppre&s;&s;ed me, I could not help &s;miling at the playful imagination of Agnes: &s;he had perfectly pre&s;erved dame Cunegonda's re&s;emblance, but had &s;o much exaggerated every fault, and rendered every feature &s;o irre&s;i&s;tably laughable, that I could ea&s;ily conceive the duenna's anger.</P>
<P>"The figure is admirable, my dear Agnes! I knew not that you po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch talents for the ridic|ulous."</P>
<P>"Stay a moment," &s;he replied: "I will &s;hew you a figure &s;till more ridiculous than dame Cunegonda's. If it plea&s;es you, you may di&s;po&s;e of it as &s;eems be&s;t to your&s;elf."</P>
<P>She ro&s;e, and went to a cabinet at &s;ome little di&s;|tance: unlocking a drawer, &s;he took out a &s;mall ca&s;e, which &s;he opened, and pre&s;ented to me.</P>
<P>"Do you know the re&s;emblance?" &s;aid &s;he, &s;miling.</P>
<P>It was her own.</P>
<P>Tran&s;ported at the gift, I pre&s;&s;ed the portrait to my lips with pa&s;&s;ion: I threw my&s;elf at her feet, and de|clared my gratitude in the warme&s;t and mo&s;t affec|tionate terms. She li&s;tened to me with complai&s;ance,
<PB N="166" REF="035729_0164_100658F68562D860">
and a&s;&s;ured me that &s;he &s;hared my &s;entiments; when &s;uddenly &s;he uttered a loud &s;hriek, di&s;engaged the hand which I held, and flew from the room by a door which opened to the garden. Amazed at this abrupt departure, I ro&s;e ha&s;tily from my knees. I beheld with confu&s;ion the barone&s;s &s;tanding near me, glow|ing with jealou&s;y, and almo&s;t choaked with rage. On recovering from her &s;woon, &s;he had tortured her im|agination to di&s;cover her concealed rival. No one ap|peared to de&s;erve her &s;u&s;picions more than Agnes. She immediately ha&s;tened to find her niece, tax her with encouraging my addre&s;&s;es, and a&s;&s;ure her&s;elf whe|ther her conjectures were well grounded. Unfortu|nately &s;he had already &s;een enough to need no other confirmation. She arrived at the door of the room, at the preci&s;e moment when Agnes gave me her por|trait. She heard me profe&s;s an everla&s;ting attachment to her rival, and &s;aw me kneeling at her feet. She advanced to &s;eparate us; we were too much occupied by each other to perceive her approach, and were not aware of it till Agnes beheld her &s;tanding by my &s;ide.</P>
<P>Rage on the part of Donna Rodolpha, embarra&s;&s;|ment on mine, for &s;ome time kept us both &s;ilent. The lady recovered her&s;elf fir&s;t.</P>
<P>"My &s;u&s;picions then were ju&s;t," &s;aid &s;he; "the coquetry of my niece has triumphed, and 'tis to her that I am &s;acrificed. In one re&s;pect, however, I am fortunate; I &s;hall not be the only one who laments a di&s;appointed pa&s;&s;ion. You, too, &s;hall know what it is to love without hope! I daily expect orders for re&s;tor|ing Agnes to her parents. Immediately upon her arrival in Spain, &s;he will take the veil, and place an

in&s;uperable barrier to your union. You may &s;pare your &s;upplications," &s;he continued, perceiving me on the point of &s;peaking&mdash;"my re&s;olution is fixed and immoveable. Your mi&s;tre&s;s &s;hall remain a clo&s;e pri&s;|oner in her chamber, till &s;he exchanges this ca&s;tle for the cloi&s;ter. Solitude will perhaps recal her to a &s;en&s;e of her duty: but to prevent your oppo&s;ing that wi&s;hed event, I mu&s;t inform you, Don Alphon&s;o, that your pre&s;ence here is no longer agreeable either to the baron or my&s;elf. It was not to make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to my niece, that your relations &s;ent you to Germany; your bu&s;ine&s;s was to travel, and I &s;hould be &s;orry to impede any longer &s;o excellent a de&s;ign. Farewell, Segnor; re|member, that to-morrow morning we meet for the la&s;t time."</P>
<P>Having &s;aid this, &s;he darted upon me a look of pride, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ntempt, and malice, and quitted the apart|ment. I al&s;o retired to mine, and con&s;umed the night in planning the means of re&s;cuing Agnes from the power of her tyrannical aunt.</P>
<P>After the po&s;itive declaration of its mi&s;tre&s;s, it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to make a longer &s;tay at the ca&s;tle of Lindenberg. Accordingly, I the next day announced my immediate departure. The baron declared that it gave him &s;incere pain; and he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in my favour &s;o warmly, that I endeavoured to win him over to my intere&s;t. Scarcely had I mentioned the name of Agnes when he &s;topped me &s;hort, and &s;aid, that it was totally out of his power to interfere in the bu&s;in|e&s;s. I &s;aw that it was in vain to argue; the baron|e&s;s governed her hu&s;band with de&s;potic &s;way, and I ea&s;ily perceived that &s;he had prejudiced him again&s;t the

<P>At quitting him, the baron &s;hook my hand affection|ately, and a&s;&s;ured me, that, as &s;oon as his niece was gone, I might con&s;ider his hou&s;e as my own.</P>
<P>"Farewell, Don Alphon&s;o!" &s;aid the barone&s;s, and &s;tretched out her hand to me.</P>
<P>I took it, and offered to carry it to my lips. She prevented me. Her hu&s;band was at the other end of the room, and out of hearing.</P>
<P>"Take care of your&s;elf," &s;he continued; "my love is become hatred, and my wounded pride &s;hall not be unatoned. Go where you will, my vengeance &s;hall follow you!"</P>
<P>She accompanied the&s;e words with a look &s;ufficient to make me tremble. I an&s;wered not, but ha&s;tened to quit the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>As my chai&s;e drove out of the court, I looked up to the windows of your &s;i&s;ter's chamber: nobody was to be &s;eeen there. I threw my&s;elf back de&s;pondent in my carriage. I was attended by no other &s;ervants than a Frenchman, whom I had hired at Stra&s;bourg in Stephano's room, and my little page, whom I before mentioned to you. The fidelity, intelligence, and good temper of Theodore had already made him dear to me; but he now prepared to lay an obligation on me, which made me look upon him as a guardian ge|nius. Scarcely had we proceeded half a mile from the ca&s;tle, when he rode up to the chai&s;e door.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="035729_0167_1006592A0526DCE8">
"Take courage, Segnor!" &s;aid he in Spani&s;h, which he had already learnt to &s;peak with fluency and correctne&s;s: "While you were with the baron I watched the moment when dame Cunegonda was be|low &s;tairs, and mounted into the chamber over that of Donna Agnes. I &s;ang, as loud as I could, a little German air, well known to her, hoping that &s;he would recollect my voice. I was not di&s;appointed, for I &s;oon heard her window open. I ha&s;tened to let down a &s;tring with which I had provided my&s;elf. Upon hearing the ca&s;ement clo&s;ed again, I drew up the &s;tring, and fa&s;tened to it, I found this &s;crap of paper."</P>
<P>He then pre&s;ented me with a &s;mall no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, addre&s;&s;ed to me. I opened it with impatience. It contained the following words, written in pencil:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>Conceal your&s;elf for the next fortnight in &s;ome neighbouring village. My aunt will believe you to have quitted Lindenberg, and I &s;hall be re&s;tored to liberty."

<CLOSER><SIGNED>Adieu. AGNES.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>At peru&s;ing the&s;e lines my tran&s;ports exceeded all bounds; neither did I &s;et any to the expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude which I heaped upon Theodore. In fact, his addre&s;s and attention merited my warme&s;t prai&s;e. You will readily believe that I had not entru&s;ted him with my pa&s;&s;ion for Agnes; but the arch youth had too much di&s;cernment not to di&s;cover my &s;ecret, and too much di&s;cretion not to conceal his knowledge of it.
<PB N="170" REF="035729_0168_100658F80B56ADF0">
He ob&s;erved in &s;ilence what was going on, nor &s;trove to make him&s;elf an agent in the bu&s;ine&s;s till my intere&s;ts required his interference. I equally admired his judgment, his penetration, his addre&s;s, and his fi|delity. This was not the fir&s;t occa&s;ion in which I had found him of infinite u&s;e, and I was every day more convinced of his quickne&s;s and capacity. During my &s;hort &s;tay at Stra&s;bourg, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ad applied him&s;elf dili|gently to learn the rudiments of Spani&s;h. He continu|ed to &s;tudy it, and with &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s, that he &s;poke it with the &s;ame facility as his native language. He pa&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t part of his time in reading. He had acquired much information for his age; and united the advantages of a lively countenance and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing figure to an excellent under&s;tanding and the very be&s;t of hearts. He is now fifteen. He is &s;till in my &s;ervice; and, when you &s;ee him, I am &s;ure that he will plea&s;e you. But excu&s;e this digre&s;|&s;ion; I return to the &s;ubject which I quitted.</P>
<P>I obeyed the in&s;tructions of Agnes. I proceeded to Munich: there I left my chai&s;e under the care of Lucas, my French &s;ervant, and then returned on hor&s;eback to a &s;mall village about four miles di&s;tant from the ca&s;tle of Lindenberg. Upon arriving there, a &s;tory was related to the ho&s;t at who&s;e inn I alighted, which prevented his wondering at my making &s;o long a &s;tay in his hou&s;e. The old man fortunately, was credulous and incurious: he believed all I &s;aid, and &s;ought to know no more than what I thought proper to tell him. Nobody was with me but Theodore: both were di&s;gui&s;ed; and as we kept our&s;elves clo&s;e, we were not &s;u&s;pected to be other than what we &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">emed. In this manner the fortnight pa&s;&s;ed away.
<PB N="171" REF="035729_0169_1006592B8BA29788">
During that time I had the plea&s;ing conviction that Agnes was once more at liberty. She pa&s;&s;ed through the village with dame Cunegonda: &s;he &s;eemed in good health and &s;pirits, and talked to her companion with|out any appearance of con&s;traint.</P>
<P>"Who are tho&s;e ladies?" &s;aid I to my ho&s;t as the carriage pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>"Baron Lindenberg's niece, with her governe&s;s," he replied: "&s;he goes regularly every Friday to the convent of St. Catherine, in which &s;he was brought up, and which is &s;ituated about a mile from hence."</P>
<P>You may be certain that I waited with impatience for the en&s;uing Friday. I again beheld my lovely mi&s;tre&s;s. She ca&s;t her eyes upon me as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed the inn door. A blu&s;h which over&s;pread her cheek told me, that in &s;pite of my di&s;gui&s;e I had been recogni&s;ed. I bowed profoundly. She returned the compliment by a &s;light inclination of the head, as if made to one inferior, and looked another way till the carriage was out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>The long expected, long wi&s;hed for night arrived. It was calm, and the moon was at the full. As &s;oon as the clock &s;truck eleven I ha&s;tened to my appoint|ment, determined not to be too late. Theodore had provided a ladder; I a&s;cended the garden wall with|out difficulty. The page followed me and drew the ladder after us. I po&s;ted my&s;elf in the we&s;t pavilion, and waited impatiently for the approach of Agnes. Every breeze that whi&s;pered, every leaf that fell, I believed to be her foot&s;tep, and ha&s;tened to meet her. Thus was I obliged to pa&s;s a full hour, every minute
<PB N="172" REF="035729_0170_100658F9A20AC478">
of which appeared to me an age. The ca&s;tle bell at length tolled twelve, and &s;carcely could I believe the night to be no further advanced. Another quarter of an hour elap&s;ed, and I heard the light foot of my mi&s;|tre&s;s approaching the pavilion with precaution. I flew to receive her, and conducted her to a feat. I threw my&s;elf at her feet, and was expre&s;&s;ing my joy at &s;eeing her, when &s;he thus interrupted me:</P>
<P>"We have no time to lo&s;e, Alphon&s;o; the mo|ments are precious; for, though no more a pri&s;oner, Cunegonda watches my every &s;tep. An expre&s;s is arrived from my father; I mu&s;t depart immediately for Madrid, and 'tis with difficulty that I have ob|tained a week's delay. The &s;uper&s;tition of my pa|rents, &s;upported by the repre&s;entations of my cruel aunt, leaves me no hope of &s;oftening them to com|pa&s;&s;ion. In this dilemma, I have re&s;olved to commit my&s;elf to your honor. God grant that you may never give me cau&s;e to repent my re&s;olution! Flight is my only re&s;ource from the horrors of a convent; and my imprudence mu&s;t be excu&s;ed by the urgency of the danger. Now li&s;ten to the plan by which I hope to effect my e&s;cape.</P>
<P>"We are now at the thirtieth of April. On the fifth day from this the vi&s;ionary nun is expected to appear. In my la&s;t vi&s;it to the convent I provided my&s;elf with a dre&s;s proper for the character. A friend whom I have left there, and to whom I made no &s;cruple to confide my &s;ecret, readily con&s;ented to &s;upply me with a religious habit. Provide a carriage, and be with it at a little di&s;tance from the great gate of the ca&s;tle. As &s;oon as the clock &s;trikes 'one,' I

&s;hall quit my chamber, dre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame apparel as the gho&s;t is &s;uppo&s;ed to wear. Whoever meets me will be too much terrified to oppo&s;e my e&s;cape: I &s;hall ea&s;ily reach the door, and throw my&s;elf under your protection. Thus far &s;ucce&s;s is certain: but, oh! Alphon&s;o, &s;hould you deceive me; &s;hould you de&s;pi&s;e my imprudence, and reward it with ingrati|tude, the world will not hold a being more wretched than my&s;elf! I feel all the dangers to which I &s;hall be expo&s;ed. I feel that I am giving you a right to treat me with levity; but I rely upon your love, upon your honor! The &s;tep which I am on the point of taking will incen&s;e my relations again&s;t me; &s;hould you de&s;ert me; &s;hould you betray the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in you, I &s;hall have no friend to puni&s;h your in&s;ult, or &s;upport my cau&s;e. On your&s;elf alone re&s;ts all my hope; and if your own heart does not plead in my behalf, I am undone for ever!"</P>
<P>The tone in which &s;he pronounced the&s;e words was &s;o touching that, in &s;pite of my joy at receiving her promi&s;e to follow me, I could not help being affected. I al&s;o repined in &s;ecret at not having taken the pre|caution to provide a carriage at the village; in which ca&s;e, I might have carried off Agnes that very night. Such an attempt was now impracticable; neither carriage nor hor&s;es were to be procured nearer than Munich, which was di&s;tant from Lindenberg two good day's journey. I was therefore obliged to chime in with her plan, which, in truth, &s;eemed well ar|ranged. Her di&s;gui&s;e would &s;ecure her from being &s;topped in quitting the ca&s;tle, and would enable her to &s;tep into the carriage at the very gate, without dif|ficulty or lo&s;ing time.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="035729_0172_100658FC4AE14B28">
Agnes reclined her head mournfully upon my &s;houl|der, and, by the light of the moon, I &s;aw tears flow|ing down her cheek. I &s;trove to di&s;&s;ipate her melan|choly, and encouraged her to look forward to the pro&s;|pect of happine&s;s. I prote&s;ted in the mo&s;t &s;olemn terms that her virtue and innocence would be &s;afe in my keeping; and that, till the church had made her my lawful wife, her honor &s;hould be held by me as &s;acred as a &s;i&s;ter's. I told her that my fir&s;t care &s;hould be to find you out, Lorenzo, and reconcile you to our union; and I was continuing to &s;peak in the &s;ame &s;train, when a noi&s;e without alarmed me. Sud|denly the door of the pavilion was thrown open, and Cunegonda &s;tood before us. She had heard Agnes &s;teal out of her chamber, followed her into the garden, and perceived her entering the pavilion. Favoured by the trees which &s;haded it, and unperceived by Theodore, who waited at a little di&s;tance, &s;he had ap|proached in &s;ilence, and overheard our whole conver|&s;ation.</P>
<P>"Admirable!" cried Cunegonda, in a voice &s;hrill with pa&s;&s;ion, while Agnes uttered a loud &s;hriek. "By St. Barbara, young lady, you have an excellent inven|tion! You mu&s;t per&s;onate the bleeding nun, truly! What impiety! What incredulity! Marry, I have a good mind to let you pur&s;ue your plan. When the real gho&s;t met you, I warrant you would be in a pretty condition! Don Alphon&s;o, you ought to be a&s;hamed of your&s;elf for &s;educing a young, ignorant creature to leave her family and friends. However, for this time, at lea&s;t, I &s;hall mar your wicked de|&s;igns. The noble lady &s;hall be informed of the whole affair, and Agnes mu&s;t defer playing the &s;pectre till a

better opportunity. Farewell, Segnor.&mdash;Donna Ag|nes, let me have the honor of conducting your gho&s;t|&s;hip back to your apartment."</P>
<P>She approached the &s;ofa on which her trembling pupil was &s;eated, took her by the hand, and prepared to lead her from the pavilion.</P>
<P>I detained her, and &s;trove by entreaties, &s;oothing promi&s;es, and flattery, to win her to my party; but, finding all that I could &s;ay of no avail, I abandoned the vain attempt.</P>
<P>"Your ob&s;tinacy mu&s;t be its own puni&s;hment," &s;aid I; "but one re&s;ource remains to &s;ave Agnes and my&s;elf, and I &s;hall not he&s;itate to employ it."</P>
<P>Terrified at this menace, &s;he again endeavoured to quit the pavilion; but I &s;eized her by the wri&s;t, and detained her forcibly. At the &s;ame moment Theo|dore, who had followed her into the room, clo&s;ed the door, and prevented her e&s;cape. I took the veil of Agnes; I threw it round the duenna's head, who ut|tered &s;uch piercing &s;hrieks, that, in &s;pite of our di&s;|tance from the ca&s;tle, I dreaded their being heard. At length I &s;ucceeded in gagging her &s;o completely that &s;he could not produce a &s;ingle &s;ound. Theodore and my&s;elf, with &s;ome difficulty, next contrived to bind her hands and feet with our handkerchiefs; and I advi&s;ed Agnes to regain her chamber with all dili|gence. I promi&s;ed that no harm &s;hould happen to Cunegonda; bade her remember that, on the fifth of May, I &s;hould be in waiting at the great gate of the ca&s;tle, and took of her an affectionate farewell. Trembling and unea&s;y, &s;he had &s;carce power enough
<PB N="176" REF="035729_0174_100658FEF540A8F0">
to &s;ignify her con&s;ent to my plans, and fled back to her apartment in di&s;order and confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the mean while Theodore a&s;&s;i&s;ted me in carrying off my antiquated prize. She was hoi&s;ted over the wall, placed before me upon my hor&s;e, like a port|manteau, and I galloped away with her from the ca&s;|tle of Lindenberg. The unlucky duenna never had made a more di&s;agreeable journey in her life. She was jolted and &s;haken till &s;he was become little more than an animated mummy; not to mention her fright, when we waded through a &s;mall river, through which it was nece&s;&s;ary to pa&s;s in order to regain the village. Before we reached the inn, I had already de|termined how to di&s;po&s;e of the trouble&s;ome Cunegon|da. We entered the &s;treet in which the inn &s;tood; and while the page knocked, I waited at a little di&s;|tance. The landlord opened the door with a lamp in his hand.</P>
<P>"Give me the light," &s;aid Theodore, "my ma&s;ter is coming."</P>
<P>He &s;natched the lamp ha&s;tily, and purpo&s;ely let it fall upon the ground. The landlord returned to the kitchen to relight the lamp, leaving the door open. I profited by the ob&s;curity, &s;prang from my hor&s;e with Cunegonda in my arms, darted up &s;tairs, reached my chamber unperceived, and, unlocking the door of a &s;pacious clo&s;et, &s;towed her within it, and then turned the key. The landlord and Theodore &s;oon after ap|peared with lights: the former expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf &s;ur|pri&s;ed at my returning &s;o late, but a&s;ked no impertinent que&s;tions. He &s;oon quitted the room, and left me to exult in the &s;ucce&s;s of my undertaking.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="035729_0175_100659326A77DF38">
I immediately paid a vi&s;it to my pri&s;oner. I &s;trove to per&s;uade her to &s;ubmit with patience to her tem|porary confinement. My attempt was un&s;ucce&s;sful. Unable to &s;peak or move, &s;he expre&s;&s;e her fury by her looks; and, except at meals, I n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">er dared to un|bind her, or relea&s;e her from the gag. At &s;uch times I &s;tood over her with a drawn &s;word, and prote&s;ted that, if &s;he uttered a &s;ingle cry, I would plunge it in her bo&s;om. As &s;oon as &s;he had done eating, the gag was replaced. I was con&s;cious that this proceeding was cruel, and could only be ju&s;tified by the urgency of circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>As to Theodore, he had no &s;cruples upon the &s;ub|ject. Cunegonda's captivity entertained him beyond mea&s;ure. During his abode in the ca&s;tle, a continual warfare had been carried on between him and the duenna; and, now that he found his enemy &s;o ab&s;o|lutely in his power, he triumphed without mercy: he &s;eemed to think of nothing but how to find out new means of plaguing her. Sometimes he affected to pity her misfortune, then laughed at, abu&s;ed, and mimicked her: he played her a thou&s;and tricks, each more pro|voking than the other; and amu&s;ed him&s;elf by telling her, that her elopement mu&s;t have occa&s;ioned much &s;urpri&s;e at the baron's. This was in fact the ca&s;e. No one, except Agnes, could imagine what was be|come of dame Cunegonda. Every hole and corner was &s;earched for her, the ponds were dragged, and the woods underwent a thorough examination. Still no dame Cunegonda made her appearance. Agnes kept the &s;ecret, and I kept the duenna: the barone&s;s, therefore, remained in total ignorance re&s;pecting the old woman's fate, but &s;u&s;pected her to have peri&s;hed
<PB N="178" REF="035729_0176_10065900ABF92420">
by &s;uicide. Thus pa&s;&s;ed away five days, during which I had prepared every thing nece&s;&s;ary for my enterpri&s;e. On quitting Agnes, I had made it my fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s to di&s;patch a pea&s;ant with a letter to Lucas, at Munich, ordering him to take care that a coach and four &s;hould arrive about ten o'clock on the fifth of May at the village of Ro&s;enwald. He obeyed my in&s;tructions punctually; the equipage arrived at the time appoint|ed. As the period of her lady's elopement drew nearer, Cunegonda's rage increa&s;ed. I verily believe, that &s;pite <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> pa&s;&s;ion would have killed her, had I not luckily di&s;covered her prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in favour of cherry|brandy. With this favourite liquor &s;he was plenti|fully &s;upplied, and, Theodore always remaining to guard her, the gag was occa&s;ionally removed. The liquor &s;eemed to have a wonderful effect in &s;oftening the acrimony of her nature; and her confinement not admitting of any other amu&s;ement, &s;he got drunk regularly once a day, ju&s;t by way of pa&s;&s;ing the time.</P>
<P>The fifth of May arrived, a period by me never to be forgotten! Before the clock &s;truck twelve, I be|took my&s;elf to the &s;cene of action. Theodore follow|ed me on hor&s;eback. I concealed the carriage in a &s;pacious cavern of the hill on who&s;e brow the ca&s;tle was &s;ituated. This cavern was of con&s;iderable depth, and, among the pea&s;ants, was known by the name of Lindenberg Hole. The night was calm and beauti|ful: the moon beams fell upon the ancient towers of the ca&s;tle, and &s;hed upon their &s;ummits a &s;ilver light. All was &s;till around me; nothing was to be heard except the night breeze &s;ighing among the leaves, the di&s;tant barking of village dogs, or the owl who had e&s;tabli&s;hed her&s;elf in a nook of the de&s;erted ea&s;tern
<PB N="179" REF="035729_0177_100659342ABA6E48">
turret. I heard her melancholy &s;hriek, and looked upwards; &s;he &s;at upon the ridge of a window, which I recogni&s;ed to be that of the haunted room. This brought to my remembrance the &s;tory of the bleeding nun, and I &s;ighed while I reflected on the influence of &s;uper&s;tition, and weakne&s;s of human rea&s;on. Sud|denly I heard a faint chorus &s;teal upon the &s;ilence of the night.</P>
<P>"What can occa&s;ion that noi&s;e, Theodore?"</P>
<P>"A &s;tranger of di&s;tinction," replied he, "pa&s;&s;ed through the village to-day in his way to the ca&s;tle: he is reported to be the father of Donna Agnes. Doubt|le&s;s the baron has given an entertainment to celebrate his arrival."</P>
<P>The ca&s;tle bell announced the hour of midnight. This was the u&s;ual &s;ignal for the family to retire to bed. Soon after I perceived lights in the ca&s;tle, mov|ing backwards and forwards in different directions. I conjectured the company to be &s;eparating. I could hear the heavy doors grate as they opened with diffi|culty; and as they clo&s;ed again, the rotten ca&s;ements rattled in their frames. The chamber of Agnes was on the other &s;ide of the ca&s;tle. I trembled le&s;t &s;he &s;hould have failed in obtaining the key of the haunted room. Through this it was nece&s;&s;ary for her to pa&s;s, in order to reach the narrow &s;tairca&s;e by which the gho&s;t was &s;uppo&s;ed to de&s;cend into the great hall. Agitated by this apprehen&s;ion, I kept my eyes con|&s;tantly fixed upon the window, where I hoped to per|ceive the friendly glare of a lamp borne by Agnes. I now heard the ma&s;&s;y gates unbarred. By the candle in his hand, I di&s;tingui&s;hed old Conrad, the porter.
<PB N="180" REF="035729_0178_100659023762D158">
He &s;et the portal doors wide open, and retired. The lights in the ca&s;tle gradually di&s;appeared, and at length the whole building was wrapped in darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>While I &s;at upon a broken ridge of the hill, the &s;tillne&s;s of the &s;cene in&s;pired me with melancholy ideas not altogether unplea&s;ing. The ca&s;tle, which &s;tood full in my &s;ight, formed an object equally awful and picture&s;que. Its ponderous walls, tinged by the moon with &s;olemn brightne&s;s; its old and partly ru|ined towers, lifting them&s;elves into the clouds, and &s;eeming to frown on the plains around them; its lofty battlements, overgrown with ivy, and folding gates, expanding in honor of the vi&s;ionary inhabitant, made me &s;en&s;ible of a &s;ad and reverential horror. Yet did not the&s;e &s;en&s;ations occupy me &s;o fully as to pre|vent me from witne&s;&s;ing with impatience the &s;low progre&s;s of time. I approached the ca&s;tle, and ventur|ed to walk round it. A few rays of light &s;till glimmer|ed in the chamber of Agnes. I ob&s;erved them with joy. I was &s;till gazing upon them, when I perceiv|ed a figure draw near the window, and the curtain was carefully clo&s;ed to conceal the lamp which burn|ed there. Convinced by this ob&s;ervation that Agnes had not abandoned our plan, I returned with a light heart to my former &s;tation.</P>
<P>The half hour &s;truck! The three quarters &s;truck! My bo&s;om beat high with hope and expectation. At length, the wi&s;hed for &s;ound was heard. The bell tolled 'one,' and the man&s;ion echoed with the noi&s;e loud and &s;olemn. I looked up to the ca&s;ement of the haunted chamber. Scarcely had five minutes elap&s;ed when the expected light appeared. I was now clo&s;e
<PB N="181" REF="035729_0179_10065935B1BB5A90">
to the tower. The window was not &s;o far from the ground, but that I fancied I perceived a female figure with a lamp in her hand moving &s;lowly along the apartment. The light &s;oon faded away, and all was again dark and gloomy.</P>
<P>Occa&s;ional gleams of brightne&s;s darted from the &s;tairca&s;e windows as the lovely gho&s;t pa&s;&s;ed by them. I traced the light through the hall: it reached the portal, and at length I beheld Agnes pa&s;s through the folding gates. She was habited exactly as &s;he had de&s;cribed the &s;pectre. A chaplet of beads hung upon her arm; her head was enveloped in a long white veil; her nun's dre&s;s was &s;tained with blood; and &s;he had taken care to provide her&s;elf with a lamp and dagger. She advanced towards the &s;pot where I &s;tood. I flew to meet her; and cla&s;ping her in my arms, I exclaimed,</P>
<LG>
<L>"Agnes! Agnes! thou art mine!</L>
<L>"Agnes! Agnes! I am thine!</L>
<L>"Faire&s;t! Deare&s;t! Thou art mine!</L>
<L>"Faire&s;t! Deare&s;t! I am thine!</L>
<L>"Leave thee will I never!</L>
<L>"Thou art mine!</L>
<L>"I am thine!</L>
<L>"Body and &s;oul for ever!"</L>
</LG>
<P>Terrified and breathle&s;s, &s;he was unable to &s;peak. She dropped her lamp and dagger, and &s;unk upon my bo&s;om in &s;ilence. I rai&s;ed her in my arms, and con|veyed her to the carriage. Theodore remained be|hind in order to relea&s;e dame Cunegonda. I al&s;o charged him with a letter to the barone&s;s, explaining the whole affair, and entreating her good offices in reconciling Don Ga&s;ton to my union with his daugh|ter.
<PB N="182" REF="035729_0180_1006590625F2C860">
I di&s;covered to her my real name. I proved to her that my birth and expectations ju&s;tified my pre|tending to her niece; and a&s;&s;ured her, though it was out of my power to return her love, that I would &s;trive uncea&s;ingly to obtain her e&s;teem and friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>I &s;tepped into the carriage, where Agnes was already &s;eated. Theodore clo&s;ed the door, and the po&s;tillions drove away. At fir&s;t I was delighted with the rapidity of our progre&s;s; but as &s;oon as we were in no danger of pur&s;uit, I called to the drivers, and bade them to moderate their pace. They &s;trove in vain to obey me; the hor&s;es refu&s;ed to an&s;wer the rein, and continued to ru&s;h on with a&s;toni&s;hing &s;wiftne&s;s. The po&s;til|lions redoubled their efforts to &s;top them; but, by kicking and plunging, the bea&s;ts &s;oon relea&s;ed them|&s;elves from this re&s;traint. Uttering a loud &s;hriek, the drivers were hurled upon the ground. Immedi|ately thick clouds ob&s;cured the &s;ky: the winds howl|ed around us, the lightning fla&s;hed, and the thunder roared tremendou&s;ly. Never did I behold &s;o frightful a tempe&s;t! Terrified by the jar of contending ele|ments, the hor&s;es &s;eemed every moment to increa&s;e their &s;peed. Nothing could interrupt their career; they dragged the carriage through hedges and ditches, da&s;hed down the mo&s;t dangerous precipices, and &s;eem|ed to vie in &s;wiftne&s;s with the rapidity of the winds.</P>
<P>All this while my companion lay motionle&s;s in my arms. Truly alarmed by the magnitude of the dan|ger, I was in vain attempting to recal her to her &s;en&s;es, when a loud cra&s;h announced that a &s;top was put to our progre&s;s in the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable manner. The carriage was &s;hattered to pieces. In falling, I &s;truck
<PB N="183" REF="035729_0181_100659397A883120">
my temple again&s;t a flint. The pain of the wound, the violence of the &s;hock, and apprehen&s;ion for the &s;afety of Agnes, combined to overpower me &s;o com|pletely, that my &s;en&s;es for&s;ook me, and I lay without animation on the ground.</P>
<P>I probably remained for &s;ome time in this &s;ituation, &s;ince, when I opened my eyes, it was broad daylight. Several pea&s;ants were &s;tanding round me, and &s;eemed di&s;puting whether my recovery was po&s;&s;ible. I &s;poke German tolerably well. As &s;oon as I could utter an articulate &s;ound, I inquired after Agnes. What was my &s;urpri&s;e and di&s;tre&s;s, when a&s;&s;ured by the pea&s;ants that nobody had been &s;een an&s;wering the de&s;cription which I gave of her! They told me, that in going to their daily labour they had been alarmed by ob&s;erving the fragments of my carriage, and by hearing the groans of an hor&s;e, the only one of the four which remained alive: the other three lay dead by my &s;ide. Nobody was near me when they came up, and much time had been lo&s;t before they &s;ucceeded in recovering me. Unea&s;y beyond expre&s;&s;ion re&s;pecting the fate of my companion, I be&s;ought the pea&s;ants to di&s;per&s;e them&s;elves in &s;earch of her. I de&s;cribed her dre&s;s, and promi&s;ed immen&s;e rewards to whoever brought me any intelligence. As for my&s;elf, it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to join in the pur&s;uit: I had broken two of my ribs in the fall; my arm being di&s;located hung u&s;ele&s;s by my &s;ide; and my left leg was &s;hattered &s;o terribly, that I never expected to recover its u&s;e.</P>
<P>The pea&s;ants complied with my reque&s;t; all left me except four, who made a litter of boughs, and pre|pared to convey me to the neighbouring town. I in|quired its name; it proved to be Rati&s;bon, and I could
<PB N="184" REF="035729_0182_10065907AC874AC0">
&s;carcely per&s;uade my&s;elf that I had travelled to &s;uch a di&s;tance in a &s;ingle night. I told the countrymen, that at one o'clock that morning I had pa&s;&s;ed through the village of Ro&s;enwald. They &s;hook their heads wi&s;tfully, and made &s;igns to each other that I mu&s;t certainly be delirious. I was conveyed to a decent inn, and immediately put to bed. A phy&s;ician was &s;ent for, who &s;et my arm with &s;ucce&s;s: he then ex|amined my other hurts, and told me that I need be un|der no apprehen&s;ion of the con&s;equences of any of them, but ordered me to keep my&s;elf quiet, and be prepared for a tedious and painful cure. I an&s;wered him, that if he hoped to keep me quiet, he mu&s;t fir&s;t endeavour to procure me &s;ome news of a lady who had quitted Ro&s;enwald in my company the night be|fore, and had been with me at the moment when the coach broke down. He &s;miled, and only replied by advi&s;ing me to make my&s;elf ea&s;y, for that all proper care &s;hould be taken of me. As he quitted me, the ho&s;te&s;s met him at the door of the room.</P>
<P>"The gentleman is not quite in his right &s;en&s;es," I heard him &s;ay to her in a low voice; "'tis the natur|al con&s;equence of his fall, but that will &s;oon be over."</P>
<P>One after another the pea&s;ants returned to the inn, and informed me that no traces had been di&s;covered of my unfortunate mi&s;tre&s;s. Unea&s;ine&s;s now became de&s;pair. I entreated them to renew their &s;earch in the mo&s;t urgent terms, doubling the promi&s;es which I had already made them. My wild and frantic manner confirmed the by-&s;tanders in the idea of my being de|lirious. No &s;igns of the lady having appeared, they believed her to be a creature fabricated by my over heated brain, and paid no attention to my entreaties.
<PB N="185" REF="035729_0183_1006593B051BA5D0">
However, the ho&s;te&s;s a&s;&s;ured me, that a fre&s;h inquiry &s;hould be made; but I found afterwards that her promi&s;e was only given to quiet me. No further &s;teps were taken in the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Though my baggage was left at Munich under the care of my French &s;ervant, having prepared my&s;elf for a long journey, my pur&s;e was amply furni&s;hed: be&s;ides, my equipage proved me to be of di&s;tinction, and in con&s;equence all po&s;&s;ible attention was paid me at the inn. The day pa&s;&s;ed away: &s;till no news ar|rived of Agnes. The anxiety of fear now gave place to de&s;pondency. I cea&s;ed to rave about her, and was plunged in the depth of melancholy reflections. Per|ceiving me to be &s;ilent and tranquil, my attendants be|lieved my delirium to have abated, and that my mala|dy had taken a favourable turn. According to the phy&s;ician's order, I &s;wallowed a compo&s;ing medicine; and as &s;oon as the night &s;hut in, my attendants with|drew, and left me to repo&s;e.</P>
<P>That repo&s;e I wooed in vain. The agitation of my bo&s;om cha&s;ed away &s;leep. Re&s;tle&s;s in my mind, in+&s;pite of the fatigue of my body, I continued to to&s;s about from &s;ide to &s;ide, till the clock in a neighbour|ing &s;teeple &s;truck 'one.' As I li&s;tened to the mourn|ful hollow &s;ound, and heard it die away in the wind, I felt a &s;udden chiilne&s;s &s;pread it&s;elf over my body. I &s;huddered without knowing wherefore; cold dews poured down my forehead, and my hair &s;tood bri&s;tling with alarm. Suddenly I heard &s;low and heavy &s;teps a&s;cending the &s;tairca&s;e. By an involuntary movement I &s;tarted up in my bed, and drew back the curtain. A &s;ingle ru&s;hlight, which glimmered upon the hearth,
<PB N="186" REF="035729_0184_100659096C9B2C98">
&s;hed a faint gleam through the apartment, which was hung with tape&s;try. The door was thrown open with violence. A figure entered, and drew near my bed with &s;olemn mea&s;ured &s;teps. With trembling appre|hen&s;ion I examined this midnight vi&s;itor. God Al|mighty! it was the bleeding nun! It was my lo&s;t companion! Her face was &s;till veiled, but &s;he no longer held her lamp and dagger. She lifted up her veil &s;lowly. What a &s;ight pre&s;ented it&s;elf to my &s;tartled eyes! I beheld before me an animated cor&s;e. Her countenance was long and haggard; her cheeks and lips were bloodle&s;s; the palene&s;s of death was &s;pread over her features; and her eyeballs, fixed &s;ted|fa&s;tly upon me, were lu&s;trele&s;s and hollow.</P>
<P>I gazed upon the &s;pectre with horror too great to be de&s;cribed. My blood was frozen in my veins. I would have called for aid, but the &s;ound expired ere it could pa&s;s my lips. My nerves were bound up in impotence, and I remained in the &s;ame attitude inan|imate as a &s;tatue.</P>
<P>The vi&s;ionary nun looked upon me for &s;ome min|utes in &s;ilence: there was &s;omething petrifying in her regard. At length, in a low &s;epulchral voice, &s;he pronounced the following words:</P>
<LG>
<L>"Raymond! Raymond! Thou art mine!</L>
<L>"Raymond! Raymond! I am thine!</L>
<L>"Leave thee will I never!</L>
<L>"I am thine!</L>
<L>"Thou art mine,</L>
<L>"Body and &s;oul for ever!"</L>
</LG>
<P>Breathle&s;s with fear, I li&s;tened while &s;he repeated my own expre&s;&s;ions. The apparition &s;eated her&s;elf
<PB N="187" REF="035729_0185_1006593CA4D71F30">
oppo&s;ite to me at the foot of the bed, and was &s;ilent. Her eyes were fixed earne&s;tly upon mine; they &s;eem|ed endowed with the property of the rattle&s;nake's, for I &s;trove in vain to look off her. My eyes were fa&s;cinated, and I had not the power of withdrawing them from the &s;pectre's.</P>
<P>In this attitude &s;he remained for a whole long hour without &s;peaking or moving; nor was I able to do either. At length the clock &s;truck 'two.' The ap|parition ro&s;e from her &s;eat, and approached the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the bed. She gra&s;ped with her icy fingers my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> which hung lifele&s;s upon the coverture, and, pr&s;&s;ing her cold lips to mine, again repeated,</P>
<LG>
<L>"Raymond! Raymond! Thou art mine&punc;</L>
<L>"Raymond! Raymond! I am thine!" <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">&mdash;</L>
</LG>
<P>She then dropped my hand, quitted the chamber with &s;low &s;teps, and the door clo&s;ed after her. Till that moment the faculties of my body had been all &s;u&s;|pended; tho&s;e of my mind had alone been waking. The charm now cea&s;ed to operate; the blood which had been frozen in my veins ru&s;hed back to my heart with violence; I uttered a deep groan, and &s;unk life|le&s;s upon my pillow.</P>
<P>The adjoining room was only &s;eparated from mine by a thin partition; it was occupied by the ho&s;t and his wife; the former was rou&s;ed by my groan, and immediately ha&s;tened to my chamber; the ho&s;te&s;s &s;oon followed him. With &s;ome difficulty they &s;ucceeded in re&s;toring me to my &s;en&s;es, and immediately &s;ent for the phy&s;ician, who arrived in all diligence. He de|clared my fever to be very much increa&s;ed, and that,
<PB N="188" REF="035729_0186_1006590AF2BD4DB8">
if I continued to &s;uffer &s;uch violent agitation, he would not take upon him to in&s;ure my life. Some medicines which he gave me, in &s;ome degree tranquillized my &s;pirits. I fell into a &s;ort of &s;lumber towards day|break, but fearful dreams prevented me from deriving any benefit from my repo&s;e. Agnes and the bleeding nun pre&s;ented them&s;elves by turns to my fancy, and combined to harra&s;s and torment me. I awoke fa|tigued and unrefre&s;hed. My fever &s;eemed rather aug|mented than dimini&s;hed; the agitation of my mind impeded my fractured bones from knitting: I had frequent fainting fits, and during the whole day the phy&s;ician judged it expedient not to quit me for two hours together.</P>
<P>The &s;ingularity of my adventure made me deter|mine to conceal it from every one, &s;ince I could not expect that a circum&s;tance &s;o &s;trange &s;hould gain cred|it. I was very unea&s;y about Agnes. I knew not what &s;he would think at not finding me at the rendez|vous, and dreaded her entertaining &s;u&s;picions of my fidelity. However, I depended upon Theodore's di&s;|cretion, and tru&s;ted that my letter to the barone&s;s would convince her of the rectitude of my intentions. The&s;e con&s;iderations &s;omewhat lightened my inquie|tude upon her account; but the impre&s;&s;ion left upon my mind by my nocturnal vi&s;itor grew &s;tronger with every &s;ucceeding moment. The night drew near; I dreaded its arrival; yet I &s;trove to per&s;uade my&s;elf that the gho&s;t would appear no more, and at all events I de&s;ired that a &s;ervant might &s;it up in my chamber.</P>
<P>The fatigue of my body, from not having &s;lept on
<PB N="189" REF="035729_0187_10063CAB93594AF8">
the former night, co-operating with the &s;trong opiates admini&s;tered to me in profu&s;ion, at length procured me that repo&s;e of which I was &s;o much in need. I &s;unk into a profound and tranquil &s;lumber, and had already &s;lept for &s;ome hours, when the neighbouring clock rou&s;ed me by &s;triking "one" its &s;ound brought with it to my memory all the horrors of the night be|fore. The &s;ame cold &s;hivering &s;eized me. I &s;tarted up in my bed, and perceived the &s;ervant fa&s;t a&s;leep in an armchair near me. I called him by his name; he made no an&s;wer. I &s;hook him forcibly by the arm, and &s;trove in vain to wake him: he was perfectly in|&s;en&s;ible to my efforts. I now heard the heavy &s;teps a&s;cending the &s;tairca&s;e; the door was thrown open, and again the bleeding nun &s;tood before me. Once more my limbs were chained in &s;econd infancy: once more I heard tho&s;e fatal words repeated:</P>
<LG>
<L>" Raymond! Raymond! Thou art mine!</L>
<L>" Raymond! Raymond! I am thine!" &amp;c.&mdash;</L>
</LG>
<P>The &s;cene which had &s;hocked me &s;o &s;en&s;ibly on the former night, was again pre&s;ented. The &s;pectre again pre&s;&s;ed her lips to mine, again touched me with her rotting fingers, and, as on her fir&s;t appearance, quitted the chamber as &s;oon as the clock told "two."</P>
<P>Every night was this repeated. Far from growing accu&s;tomed to the gho&s;t, every &s;ucceeding vi&s;it in&s;pired me with greater horror. Her idea pur&s;ued me con|tinually, and I became the prey of habitual melan|choly. The con&s;tant agitation of my mind naturally retarded the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of my health. Several months elap&s;ed before I was able to quit my bed; and when, at length, I was moved to a &s;ofa, I was &s;o faint,
<PB N="190" REF="035729_0188_1006590EB935A528">
&s;piritle&s;s, and emaciated, that I could not cro&s;s the room without a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The looks of my attendants &s;ufficiently denoted the little hope which they enter|tained of my recovery. The profound &s;adne&s;s which oppre&s;&s;ed me without remi&s;&s;ion, made the phy&s;ician con&s;ider me to be an hypochondriac. The cau&s;e of my di&s;tre&s;s I carefully concealed in my own bo&s;om, for I knew that no one could give me relief. The gho&s;t was not even vi&s;ible to any eye but mine. I had frequently cau&s;ed attendants to &s;it up in my room; but the moment that the clock &s;truck "one," irre&s;i&s;t|ible &s;lumber &s;eized them, nor left them till the de|parture of the gho&s;t.</P>
<P>You may be &s;urpri&s;ed that during this time I made no inquiries after your &s;i&s;ter. Theodore, who with difficulty had di&s;covered my abode, had quieted my apprehen&s;ions for her &s;afety; at the &s;ame time he con|vinced me, that all attempts to relea&s;e her from captiv|ity mu&s;t be fruitle&s;s, till I &s;hould be in a condition to return to Spain. The particulars of her adventure, which I &s;hall now relate to you, were partly commu|nicated to me by Theodore, and partly by Agnes her|&s;elf.</P>
<P>On the fatal night when her elopement was to have taken place, accident had not permitted her to quit her chamber at the appointed time. At length &s;he ven|tured into the haunted room, de&s;cended the &s;tairca&s;e leading into the hall, found the gates open as &s;he ex|pected, and le&s;t the ca&s;tle unob&s;erved. What was her &s;urpri&s;e at not finding me ready to receive her! She examined the cavern, ranged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ough every alley of the neighbouring wood, and pa&s;&s;ed two full hours
<PB N="191" REF="035729_0189_1006594236DFDDE8">
in this fruitle&s;s inquiry. She could di&s;cover no traces either of me or of the carriage. Alarmed and di&s;appoint|ed, her only re&s;ource was to return to the ca&s;tle before the barone&s;s mi&s;&s;ed her; but here &s;he found her&s;elf in a fre&s;h embarra&s;&s;ment. The bell had already tolled "two," the gho&s;tly hour was pa&s;t, and the careful porter had locked the folding gates. After much ir|re&s;olution, &s;he ventured to knock &s;oftly. Luckily for her, Conrad was &s;till awake: he heard the noi&s;e and ro&s;e, murmuring at being called up a &s;econd time. No &s;ooner had he opened one of the doors, and be|held the &s;uppo&s;ed apparition waiting there for admit|tance, than he uttered a loud cry, and dropped upon his knees. Agnes profited by his terror: &s;he glided by him, flew to her own apartment, and, having thrown off her &s;pectre's trappings, retired to bed, endeavouring in vain to account for my di&s;appearing.</P>
<P>In the mean while, Theodore, having &s;een my car|riage drive off with the fal&s;e Agnes, returned joyfully to the village. The next morning he relea&s;ed Cune|gonda from her confinement, and accompanied her to the ca&s;tle. There he found the baron, his lady, and Don Ga&s;ton, di&s;puting together upon the porter's re|lation. All of them agreed in believing the exi&s;tence of &s;pectres; but the latter contended, that for a gho&s;t to knock for admittance was a proceeding till then un|witne&s;&s;ed, and totally incompatible with the immate|rial nature of a &s;pirit. They were &s;till di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the &s;ubject, when the page appeared with Cunegonda, and cleared up the my&s;tery. On hearing his depo&s;ition, it was agreed unanimou&s;ly, that the Agnes whom Theodore had &s;een &s;tep into my carriage mu&s;t have been the bleeding nun, and that the gho&s;t who had
<PB N="192" REF="035729_0190_1006591045434658">
terrified Conrad was no other than Don Ga&s;ton's daughter.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;e which this di&s;covery occa&s;ioned being over, the barone&s;s re&s;olved to make it of u&s;e in per&s;uading her niece to take the veil. Fearing le&s;t &s;o advantageous an e&s;tabli&s;hment for his daughter &s;hould induce Don Ga&s;ton to renounce his re&s;olution, &s;he &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed my letter, and continued to repre&s;ent me as a needy unknown adventurer. A childi&s;h vanity had led me to conceal my real name even from my mi&s;|tre&s;s; I wi&s;hed to be loved for my&s;elf, not for being the &s;on and heir of the marquis de las Ci&s;ternas. The con&s;equence was, that my rank was known to no one in the ca&s;tle except the barone&s;s, and &s;he took good care to confine the knowledge to her own brea&s;t. Don Ga&s;ton having approved his &s;i&s;ter's de&s;ign, Agnes was &s;ummoned to appear before them. She was taxed with having meditated an elopement, obliged to make a full confe&s;&s;ion, and was amazed at the gentlene&s;s with which it was received: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> what was her afflic|tion, when informed that the failure of her project mu&s;t be attributed to me! Cunegonda, tutored by the barone&s;s, told her, that when I relea&s;ed her I had de|&s;ired her to inform her lady that our connection was at an end, that the whole affair was occa&s;ioned by a fal&s;e report, and that it by no means &s;uited my cir|cum&s;tances to marry a woman without fortune or ex|pectations.</P>
<P>To this account, my &s;udden di&s;appearing gave but too great an air of probability. Theodore, who could have contradicted the &s;tory, by Donna Rodolpha's order was kept out of her &s;ight. What proved a &s;till greater
<PB N="193" REF="035729_0191_10065943C3374DA0">
confirmation of my being an impo&s;tor, was the ar|rival of a letter from your&s;elf, declaring that you had no &s;ort of acquaintance with Alphon&s;o d'Alvarada.&mdash;The&s;e &s;eeming proofs of my perfidy, aided by the art|ful in&s;inuations of her aunt, by Cunegonda's flattery, and her father's threats and anger, entirely conquered your &s;i&s;ter's repugnance to a convent. Incen&s;ed at my behaviour, and di&s;gu&s;ted with the world in gene|ral, &s;he con&s;ented to receive the veil. She pa&s;&s;ed an|other month at the ca&s;tle of Lindenberg, during which, my non-appearance confirmed her in her re&s;olution, and then accompanied Don Ga&s;ton into Spain. The|odore was now &s;et at liberty. He ha&s;tened to Mu|nich, where I had promi&s;ed to let him hear from me; but finding from Lucas that I never arrived there, he pur&s;ued his &s;earch with indefatigable per&s;everance, and at length &s;ucceeded in rejoining me at Rati&s;bon.</P>
<P>So much was I altered, that &s;carcely could he recol|lect my features: the di&s;tre&s;s vi&s;ible upon his, &s;uffi|ciently te&s;tified how lively was the intere&s;t which he felt for me. The &s;ociety of this amiable boy, whom I had always con&s;idered rather as a companion that a &s;ervant, was now my only comfort. His conver&s;ation was gay, yet &s;en&s;ible, and his ob&s;ervations &s;hrewd and entertaining. He had picked up much more know|ledge than is u&s;ual at his age; but what rendered him mo&s;t agreeable to me, was his having a delightful voice, and no mean &s;kill in mu&s;ic. He had al&s;o ac|quired &s;ome ta&s;te in poetry, and even ventured occa&s;ion|ally to write ver&s;es him&s;elf. He frequently compo&s;ed little ballads in Spani&s;h. His compo&s;itions were but indifferent, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, yet they were plea&s;ing to me from their novelty; and hearing him &s;ing them to
<PB N="194" REF="035729_0192_10065911EE7BA0B0">
his guitar was the only amu&s;ement which I was capa|ble of receiving. Theodore perceived well enough that &s;omething preyed upon my mind; but as I con|cealed the cau&s;e of my grief even from him, re&s;pect would not permit him to pry into my &s;ecrets.</P>
<P>One evening I was lying upon my &s;ofa, plunged in reflections very far from agreeable: Theodore a|mu&s;ed him&s;elf by ob&s;erving from the window a battle between two po&s;tillions, who were quarrelling in the inn yard.</P>
<P>"Ha! ha!" cried he &s;uddenly, "yonder is the Great Mogul."</P>
<P>"Who?" &s;aid I.</P>
<P>"Only a man who made me a &s;trange &s;peech at Munich."</P>
<P>"What was the purport of it?"</P>
<P>"Now you put me in mind of it, Segnor, it was a kind of me&s;&s;age to you, but truly it was not worth delivering. I believe the fellow to be mad, for my part. When I came to Munich in &s;earch of you, I found him living at 'the King of the Romans,' and the ho&s;t gave me an odd account of him. By his ac|cent he is &s;uppo&s;ed to be a foreigner, but of what coun|try nobody <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">n tell. He &s;eemed to have no acquaint|ance in the town, &s;poke very &s;eldom, and never was &s;een to &s;mile. He had neither &s;ervants nor baggage; but his pur&s;e &s;eemed well furni&s;hed, and he did much good in the town. Some &s;uppo&s;ed him to be an Ara|bian a&s;trologer, others to be a travelling mountebank, and many declared that he was Doctor Fau&s;tus, whom
<PB N="195" REF="035729_0193_100659454CA92278">
the devil had &s;ent back to Germany. The landlord, however, told me, that he had the be&s;t rea&s;ons to be|lieve him to be the Great Mogul incognito."</P>
<P>"But the &s;trange &s;peech Theodore&mdash;"</P>
<P>"True, I had almo&s;t forgotten the &s;peech: indeed, for that matter, it would not have been a great lo&s;s if I had forgotten it altogether. You are to know, Seg|nor, that while I was inquiring about you of the landlord, this &s;tranger pa&s;&s;ed by. He &s;topped, and looked at me earne&s;tly&mdash;"Youth," &s;aid he, in a &s;olemn voice, "he whom you &s;eek, has found that which he would fain lo&s;e. My hand alone can dry up the blood. Bid your ma&s;ter wi&s;h for me when the clock &s;trikes "one."</P>
<P>"How?" cried I, &s;tarting from my &s;ofa. [The words which Theodore had repeated, &s;eemed to im|ply the &s;tranger's knowledge of my &s;ecret] "Fly to him, my boy! entreat him to grant me one moment's conver&s;ation."</P>
<P>Theodore was &s;urpri&s;ed at the vivacity of my man|ner: however, he a&s;ked no que&s;tions, but ha&s;tened to obey me. I waited his return impatiently. But a &s;hort &s;pace of time had elap&s;ed when he again appear|ed, and u&s;hered the expected gue&s;t into my chamber. He was a man of maje&s;tic pre&s;ence; his countenance was &s;trongly marked, and his eyes were large, black, and &s;parkling: yet there was a &s;omething in his look, which, the moment that I &s;aw him, in&s;pired me with a &s;ecret awe, not to &s;ay horror. He was dre&s;&s;ed plainly, his hair hung wildly upon his brow, and a band of black velvet, which encircled his forehead,
<PB N="196" REF="035729_0194_100659139E9EA368">
&s;pread over his features an additional gloom. His countenance wore the marks of profound melancholy, his &s;tep was &s;low, and his manner grave, &s;tately, and &s;olemn.</P>
<P>He &s;aluted me with politene&s;s; and having replied to the u&s;ual compliments of introduction, he motion|ed to Theodore to quit the chamber. The page in|&s;tantly withdrew.</P>
<P>"I know your bu&s;ine&s;s," &s;aid he, without giving me time to &s;peak. "I have the power of relea&s;ing you from your nightly vi&s;itor; but this cannot be done before Sunday. On the hour when the Sabbath morning breaks, &s;pirits of darkne&s;s have lea&s;t influ|ence over mortals. After Saturday the nun &s;hall vi&s;it you no more."</P>
<P>"May I not inquire," &s;aid I, "by what means you are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;ecret which I have carefully concealed from the knowledge of every one."</P>
<P>"How can I be ignorant of your di&s;tre&s;&s;es when their cau&s;e at this moment &s;tands be&s;ide you?"</P>
<P>I &s;tarted. The &s;tranger continued.</P>
<P>"Though to you only vi&s;ible for one hour in the twenty-four, neither day nor night does &s;he ever quit you; nor will &s;he ever quit you till you have granted her reque&s;t."</P>
<P>"And what is that reque&s;t?"</P>
<P>"That &s;he mu&s;t her&s;elf explain: it lies not in my knowledge. Wait with patience for the night of Sat|urday: all &s;hall be then cleared up."</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="035729_0195_10065946D76CBC10">
I dared not pre&s;s him further. He &s;oon after changed the conver&s;ation, and talked of various mat|ters. He named people who had cea&s;ed to exi&s;t for many centuries, and yet with whom he appeared to have been per&s;onally acquainted. I could not mention a country, however di&s;tant, which he had not vi&s;ited, nor could I &s;ufficiently admire the extent and variety of his information. I remarked to him, that having travelled, &s;een and known &s;o much, mu&s;t have given him infinite plea&s;ure. He &s;hook his head mourn|fully.</P>
<P>"No one," he replied, "is adequate to compre|hending the mi&s;ery of my lot! Fate obliges me to be con&s;tantly in movement; I am not permitted to pa&s;s more than a fortnight in the &s;ame place. I have no friend in the world, and, from the re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s of my de&s;tiny, I can never acquire one. Fain would I lay down my mi&s;erable life, for I envy tho&s;e who enjoy the quiet of the grave; but death eludes me, and flies from my embrace. In vain do I throw my&s;elf in the way of danger. I plunge into the ocean, the waves throw me back with abhorrence upon the &s;hore: I ru&s;h into fire; the flames recoil at my approach: I oppo&s;e my&s;elf to the fury of banditts; their &s;words become blunted, and break again&s;t my brea&s;t. The hungry tiger &s;hudders at my approach, and the alli|gator flies from a mon&s;ter more horrible than it&s;elf. God has &s;et his &s;eal upon me, and all his creatures re|&s;pect this fatal mark."</P>
<P>He put his hand to the velvet which was bound round his forehead. There was in his eyes an expre&s;|&s;ion of fury, de&s;pair, and malevolence, that &s;truck hor|ror
<PB N="198" REF="035729_0196_100659176EBBE9B8">
to my very &s;oul. An involuntary convul&s;ion made me &s;hudder. The &s;tranger perceived it.</P>
<P>"Such is the cur&s;e impo&s;ed on me," he continued: "I am doomed to in&s;pire all who look on me with terror and dete&s;tation. You already feel the influ|ence of the charm, and with every &s;ucceeding mo|ment will feel it more. I will not add to your &s;uffer|ings by my pre&s;ence. Farewell till Saturday. As &s;oon as the clock &s;trikes twelve, expect me at your chamber door."</P>
<P>Having &s;aid this he departed, leaving me in a&s;ton|i&s;hment at the my&s;terious turn of his manner and con|ver&s;ation. His a&s;&s;urances that I &s;hould &s;oon be re|lieved from the apparition's vi&s;its, produced a good ef|fect upon my con&s;titution. Theodore, whom I rather treated as an adopted child than a dome&s;tic, was &s;ur|pri&s;ed at his return to ob&s;erve the amendment in my looks. He congratulated me on this &s;ymptom of re|turning health, and declared him&s;elf delighted at my having received &s;o much benefit from my conference with the Great Mogul. Upon inquiry I found that the &s;tranger had already pa&s;&s;ed eight days in Rati&s;bon. According to his own account, therefore, he was only to remain there &s;ix days longer. Saturday was &s;till at the di&s;tance of three. Oh! with what impatience did I expect its arrival! In the interim the bleeding nun continued her nocturnal vi&s;its; but hoping &s;oon to be relea&s;ed from them altogether, the effects which they produced on me became le&s;s violent than before.</P>
<P>The wi&s;hed for night arrived. To avoid creating &s;u&s;picion, I retired to bed at my u&s;ual hour. But as &s;oon as my attendants had left me, I dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf

again, and prepared for the &s;tranger's reception. He entered my room upon the turn of midnight. A &s;mall che&s;t was in his hand, which he placed near the &s;tove. He &s;aluted me without &s;peaking; I returned the com|pliment, ob&s;erving an equal &s;ilence. He then opened his che&s;t. The fir&s;t thing which he produced was a &s;mall wooden crucifix: he knelt down and gazed upon it mournfully, and ca&s;t his eyes towards heaven. He &s;eemed to be praying devoutly. At length he bowed his head re&s;pectfully ki&s;&s;ed the crucifix thrice, and quitted his kneeling po&s;ture. He next drew from the che&s;t a covered goblet; with the liquor which it con|tained, and which appeared to be blood, he &s;prinkled the floor; and then dipping in it one end of the cru|cifix, he de&s;cribed a circle in the middle of the room. Round about this he placed various reliques, &s;culls, thigh bones, &amp;c. I ob&s;erved that he di&s;po&s;ed them all in the forms of cro&s;&s;es. La&s;tly, he took out a large Bible, and beckoned me to follow him into the circle. I obeyed him.</P>
<P>"Be cautious not to utter a &s;yllable!" whi&s;pered the &s;tranger; "&s;tep not out of the circle, and, as you love your&s;elf, dare not to look upon my face!"</P>
<P>Holding the crucifix in one hand, the Bible in the other, he &s;eemed to read with profound attention. The clock &s;truck one! As u&s;ual I heard the &s;pectre's &s;teps upon the &s;tairca&s;e; but I was not &s;eized with the accu&s;tomed &s;hivering. I waited her approach with confidence. She entered the room, drew near the circle, and &s;topped. The &s;tranger muttered &s;ome words, to me, unintelligible. Then rai&s;ing his head from the book, and extending the crucifix towards the

gho&s;t, he pronounced in a voice di&s;tinct and &s;olemn,</P>
<P>"Beatrice! Beatrice! Beatrice!"</P>
<P>"What would&s;t thou?" replied the apparition in a hollow faltering tone.</P>
<P>"What di&s;turbs thy &s;leep? Why do&s;t thou afflict and torture this youth? How can re&s;t be re&s;tored to thy unquiet &s;pirit?"</P>
<P>"I dare not tell! I mu&s;t not tell! Fain would I repo&s;e in my grave, but &s;tern commands force me to prolong my puni&s;hment!"</P>
<P>"Knowe&s;t thou this blood? Knowe&s;t thou in who&s;e veins it flowed? Beatrice! Beatrice! In his name, I charge thee to an&s;wer me."</P>
<P>"I dare not di&s;obey my ta&s;kers."</P>
<P>"Dare&s;t thou di&s;obey me?"</P>
<P>He &s;poke in a commanding tone, and drew the &s;able band from his forehead. In &s;pite of his injunc|tions to the contrary, curio&s;ity would not &s;uffer me to keep my eyes off his face; I rai&s;ed them, and beheld a burning cro&s;s impre&s;&s;ed upon his brow. For the horror with which this object in&s;pired me I cannot account, but I never felt its equal. My &s;en&s;es left me for &s;ome moments: a my&s;terious dread overcame my courage; and had not the exorci&s;er caught my hand, I &s;hould have fallen out of the circle.</P>
<P>When I recovered my&s;elf, I perceived that the burn|ing cro&s;s had produced an effect no le&s;s violent upon the &s;pectre. Her countenance expre&s;&s;ed reverence
<PB N="201" REF="035729_0199_10065A0BD00DF858">
and horror, and her vi&s;ionary limbs were &s;haken by fear.</P>
<P>"Yes!" &s;he &s;aid at length, "I tremble at that mark! I re&s;pect it! I obey you! Know then, that my bones lie &s;till unburied: they rot in the ob&s;curity of Lindenberg Hole. None but this youth has the right of con&s;igning them to the grave. His own lips have made over to me his body and his &s;oul: never will I give back his promi&s;e, never &s;hall he know a night devoid of terror, unle&s;s he engages to collect my mouldering bones, and depo&s;it them in the family vault of his Andalu&s;ian ca&s;tle. Then let thirty ma&s;&s;es be &s;aid for the repo&s;e of my &s;pirit, and I trouble this world no more. Now let me depart. Tho&s;e flames are &s;corching!"</P>
<P>He let the hand drop &s;lowly which held the crucifix, and which till then he had pointed towards her. The apparition bowed her head, and her form melted into air. The exorci&s;er led me out of the circle. He re|placed the Bible, &amp;c. in the che&s;t, and then addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me, who &s;tood near him &s;peechle&s;s from a&s;|toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>"Don Raymond, you have heard the conditions on which repo&s;e is promi&s;ed you. Be it your bu&s;ine&s;s to fulfil them to the letter. For me, nothing more re|mains than to clear up the darkne&s;s &s;till &s;pread over the &s;pectre's hi&s;tory, and inform you, that, when liv|ing, Beatrice bore the name of las Ci&s;ternas. She was the great aunt of your grandfather. In quality of your relation, her a&s;hes demand re&s;pect from you, though the enormity of her crimes mu&s;t excite your abhorrence. The nature of tho&s;e crimes no one is

more capable of explaining to you than my&s;elf. I was per&s;onally acquainted with the holy man who pro&s;cribed her nocturnal riots in the ca&s;tle of Linden|berg, and I hold this narrative from his own lips.</P>
<P>"Beatrice de las Ci&s;ternas took the veil at an early age, not by her own choice, but at the expre&s;s com|mand of her parents. She was then too young to regret the plea&s;ure<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of which her profe&s;&s;ion deprived her: but no &s;ooner did her warm and voluptuous character begin to be developed, than &s;he abandoned her&s;elf freely to the impul&s;e of her pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;eiz|ed the fir&s;t opportunity to procure their gratification. This opportunity was at length pre&s;ented, after many ob&s;tacles which only added new force to her de&s;ires. She contrived to elope from the convent, and fled to Germany with the baron Lindenberg. She lived at his ca&s;tle &s;everal months as his acknowledged mi&s;tre&s;s. All Bavaria was &s;candalized by her impudent and abandoned conduct. Her fea&s;ts vied in luxury with Cleopatra's, and Lindenberg became the theatre of the mo&s;t unbridled debauchery. Not &s;atisfied with di&s;|playing the incontinence of a pro&s;titute, &s;he profe&s;&s;ed her&s;elf an athei&s;t; &s;he took every opportunity to &s;coff at her mona&s;tic vows, and loaded with ridicule the mo&s;t &s;acred ceremonies of religion.</P>
<P>"Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a character &s;o depraved, &s;he did not long confine her affections to one object. Soon after her arrival at the ca&s;tle, the baron's younger brother attracted her notice by his &s;trong marked features, gi|gantic &s;tature, and herculean limbs. She was not of an humour to keep her inclination long unknown: but &s;he found in Otto von Lindenberg her equal in depravity. He returned her pa&s;&s;ion ju&s;t &s;ufficiently to
<PB N="203" REF="035729_0201_1006594C259F12B0">
increa&s;e it; and when he had worked it up to the de|&s;ired pitch, he fixed the price of his love at his broth|er's murder. The wretch con&s;ented to this horrible agreement. A night was pitched upon for perpetrat|ing the deed. Otto, who re&s;ided on a &s;mall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a few miles di&s;tant from the ca&s;tle, promi&s;ed that, at one in the morning, he would be waiting for her at Lin|denberg Hole; that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e would bring with him a party of cho&s;en friends, by who&s;e aid he doubted not being able to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the ca&s;tle; and that his next &s;tep &s;hould be the uniting her hand to his. It was this la&s;t promi&s;e which overruled every &s;cruple of Beatrice; &s;ince, in &s;pite of his affection for her, the baron had declared po&s;itively, that he never would make her his wife.</P>
<P>"The fatal night arrived. The baron &s;lept in the arms of his perfidious mi&s;tre&s;s when the ca&s;tle bell &s;truck 'one.' Immediately Beatrice drew a dagger from underneath her pillow, and plunged it in her paramour's heart. The baron uttered a &s;ingle dread|ful groan, and expired. The murdere&s;s quitted her bed ha&s;tily, took a lamp in one hand, in the other the bloody dagger, and bent her cour&s;e towards the cavern. The porter dared not to refu&s;e opening the gates to one more dreaded in the ca&s;tle than its ma&s;ter. Beat|rice reached Lindenberg Hole unoppo&s;ed, where, ac|cording to promi&s;e, &s;he found Otto waiting for her. He received, and li&s;tened to her narrative with tran&s;|port: but ere &s;he had time to a&s;k why he came unac|companied, he convinced her that he wi&s;hed for no witne&s;&s;es to their interview. Anxious to conceal his &s;hare in the murder, and to free him&s;elf from a woman who&s;e violent and atrocious character made

him tremble with rea&s;on for his own &s;afety, he had re&s;olved on the de&s;truction of his wretched agent. Ru&s;hing upon her &s;uddenly, he wre&s;ted the dagger from her hand. He plunged it, &s;till reeking with his brother's blood, in her bo&s;om, and put an end to her exi&s;tence by repeated blows.</P>
<P>"Otto now &s;ucceeded to the barony of Lindenberg. The murder was attributed &s;olely to the fugitive nun, and no one &s;u&s;pected him to have per&s;uaded her to the action. But though his crime was unpuni&s;hed by man, God's ju&s;tice permitted him not to enjoy in peace his blood &s;tained honors. Her bones lying &s;till unburied in the cave, the re&s;tle&s;s &s;oul of Beatrice con|tinued to inhabit the ca&s;tle. Dre&s;&s;ed in her religious habit, in memory of her vows broken to Heaven, furni&s;hed with the dagger which had drank the blood of her paramour, and holding the lamp which had guided her flying &s;teps, every night did &s;he &s;tand before the bed of Otto. The mo&s;t dreadful confu&s;ion reign|ed through the ca&s;tle. The vaulted chambers re|&s;ounded with &s;hrieks and groans; and the &s;pectre, as &s;he ranged along the antique galleries, uttered an in|coherent mixture of prayers and bla&s;phemies. Otto was unable to with&s;tand the &s;hock which he felt at this fearful vi&s;ion: its horrors increa&s;ed with every &s;uc|ceeding appearance. His <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> length became &s;o in&s;upportable, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">, and one morning he was found in his bed totally deprived of warmth and animation.

"The domains of Lindenberg now fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> to a di&s;tant relation. But terrified by the accounts given him of the bleeding nun (&s;o was the &s;pectre called by the multi|tude) the new baron called to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance a celebrated exorci&s;er. This holy man &s;ucceeded in obliging her to temporary repo&s;e: but though &s;he di&s;covered to him her hi&s;tory, he was not permitted to reveal it to others, or cau&s;e her &s;keleton to be removed to hallowed ground. That office was re&s;erved for you; and till your coming her gho&s;t was doomed to wander about the ca&s;tle, and lament the crime which &s;he had there com|mitted. However, the exorci&s;er obliged her to &s;ilence during his lifetime. So long as he exi&s;ted, the haunt|ed chamber was &s;hut up, and the &s;pectre was invi&s;ible. At his death, which happened in five years after, &s;he again appeared, but only once on every fifth year, on the &s;ame day and at the &s;ame hour when &s;he plunged her knife in the heart of her &s;leeping lover: &s;he then vi&s;ited the cavern which held her mouldering &s;keleton, returned to the ca&s;tle as &s;oon as the clock &s;truck 'two,' and was &s;een no more till the next five years had elap&s;ed.</P>
<P>"She was doomed to &s;uffer during the &s;pace of a century. That period is pa&s;t. Nothing now remains but to con&s;ign to the grave the a&s;hes of Beatrice.

<P>From this period I recovered my health &s;o rapidly as to a&s;toni&s;h my phy&s;icians. The bleeding nun ap|peared no more, and I was &s;oon able to &s;et out for Lindenberg. The baron received me with open arms. I confided to him the &s;equel of my adventure; and he was not a little plea&s;ed to find that his man&s;ion would be no longer troubled with the phantom's quinquen|nial vi&s;its. I was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">orry to perceive, that ab&s;ence had not weakened Donna Rodolpha's imprudent pa&s;&s;ion. In a private conver&s;ation which I had with her during my &s;hort &s;tay at the ca&s;tle, &s;he renewed her attempts to per&s;uade me to return her affection. Regarding her as the primary cau&s;e of all my &s;ufferings, I entertained for her no other &s;entiment than di&s;gu&s;t. The &s;kele|ton of Beatrice was found in the place which &s;he had mentioned. This being all that I &s;ought at Linden|berg, I ha&s;tened to quit the baron's domains, equally anxious to perform the ob&s;equies of the murdered nun, and e&s;cape the importunity of a woman whom I de|te&s;ted. I departed, followed by Donna Rodolpha's menaces that my contempt &s;hould not be long unpun|i&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="035729_0206_100659880FED3D70">
I now bent my cour&s;e towards Spain with all dili|gence. Lucas with my baggage had joined me dur|ing my abode at Lindenberg. I arrived in my native country without any accident, and immediately pro|ceeded to my father's ca&s;tle in Andalu&s;ia. The re|mains of Beatrice were depo&s;ited in the family vault, all due ceremonies performed, and the number of ma&s;&s;es &s;aid which &s;he had required. Nothing now hindered me from employing all my endeavours to di&s;cover the retreat of Agnes. The barone&s;s had a&s;|&s;ured me that her niece had already taken the veil; this intelligence I &s;u&s;pected to have been forged by jealou&s;y, and hoped to find my mi&s;tre&s;s &s;till at liberty to accept my hand. I inquired after her family; I found that before her daughter could reach Madrid, Donna Ine&s;illa was no more: you, my dear Loren|zo, were &s;aid to be abroad, but where I could not di&s;cover: your father was in a di&s;tant province, on a vi&s;it to the duke de Medina; and as to Agnes, no one could or would inform me what was become of her. Theodore, according to promi&s;e, had returned to Stra&s;bourg, where he found his grandfather dead, and Marguerite in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his fortune. All her per|&s;ua&s;ions to remain with her were fruitle&s;s: he quitted her a &s;econd time, and followed me to Madrid. He exerted him&s;elf to the utmo&s;t in forwarding my &s;earch: but our united endeavours were unattended by &s;ucce&s;s. The retreat which concealed Agnes remained an im|penetrable my&s;tery; and I began to abandon all hopes of recovering her.</P>
<P>About eight months ago, I was returning to my hotel in a melancholy humour, having pa&s;&s;ed the even|ing at the playhou&s;e. The night was dark, and I

was unaccompanied. Plunged in reflections which were far from being agreeable, I perceived not that three men had followed me from the theatre, till on turning into an unfrequented &s;treet, they all attacked me at the &s;ame time with the utmo&s;t fury. I &s;prang back a few paces, drew my &s;word, and threw my cloak over my left arm. The ob&s;curity of the night was in my favour. For the mo&s;t part the blows of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, being aimed at random, failed to touch me. I at length was fortunate enough to lay one of my adver&s;aries at my feet; but before this I had already received &s;o many wounds, and was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> warmly pre&s;&s;|ed, that my de&s;truction would have been inevitable, had not the cla&s;hing of &s;words called a cavalier to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance.

His ar|rival made the combat equal: yet would not the bravos abandon their de&s;ign, till the &s;ervants were on the point of joining us. They then fled away, and we lo&s;t them in the ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>The &s;tranger now addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me with po|litene&s;s, and inquired whether I was wounded. Faint with the lo&s;s of blood, I could &s;carcely thank him for his &s;ea&s;onable aid, and entreat him to let &s;ome of his &s;ervants convey me to the hotel de las Ci&s;ternas. I no &s;ooner mentioned the name than he profe&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf an acquaintance of my father's, and declared that he would not permit my being tran&s;ported to &s;uch a di&s;tance before my wounds had been examined. He added, that his hou&s;e was hard by, and begged me to accompany him thither. His manner was &s;o earne&s;t, that I could not reject his offer; and, leaning upon his arm, a few minutes brought me to the porch of a magnificent hotel.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="035729_0208_10065989AFAF7D30">

On entering the hou&s;e, an old greyheaded dome&s;tic came to welcome my conductor: he inquired when the duke, his ma&s;ter, meant to quit the country, and was an&s;wered, that he would remain there yet &s;ome months. My deliverer then de&s;ired the family &s;urgeon to be &s;ummoned without delay: his orders were obey|ed. I was &s;eated upon a &s;ofa in a noble apartment; and my wounds being examined, they were declared to be very &s;light. The &s;urgeon, however, advi&s;ed me not to expo&s;e my&s;elf to the night air; and the &s;tran|ger pre&s;&s;ed me &s;o earne&s;tly to take a bed in his hou&s;e, that I con&s;ented to remain where I was for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Being now left alone with my deliverer, I took the opportunity of thanking him in more expre&s;s terms than I had done hitherto; but he begged me to be &s;ilent on that &s;ubject.</P>

It was only to be equalled by my &s;ecret &s;atisfaction at the a&s;&s;urance, that Agnes inhabited the convent of St. Clare. This latter &s;en&s;ation was not a little weakened, when, in an&s;wer to my &s;eemingly indifferent que&s;tions, he told me that his daughter had really taken the veil. I &s;uffered not my grief at this circum&s;tance to take root in my mind: I flattered my&s;elf with the idea, that my uncle's credit at the court of Rome would remove this ob&s;tacle, and that, without difficulty, I &s;hould ob|tain for my mi&s;tre&s;s a di&s;pen&s;ation from her vows. Buoyed up with this hope, I calmed the unea&s;ine&s;s of my bo&s;om; and I redoubled my endeavours to appear grateful for the attention, and plea&s;ed with the &s;ociety, of Don Ga&s;ton.</P>
<P>A dome&s;tic now entered the room, and informed me that the bravo whom I had wounded di&s;covered &s;ome &s;igns of life. I de&s;ired that he might be carried to my father's hotel, and &s;aid that, as &s;oon as he recovered his voice, I would examine him re&s;pecting his rea&s;ons for attempting my life. I was an&s;wered, that he was already able to &s;peak, though with difficulty. Don Ga&s;ton's curio&s;ity made him pre&s;s me to interro|gate the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in in his pre&s;ence; but this curio&s;ity I was by no means inclined to gratify. One rea&s;on was, that, &s;u&s;pecting from whence the blow came, I was unwilling to place before Don Ga&s;ton's eyes the guilt of a &s;i&s;ter. Another was, that I feared to be re|cogni&s;ed for Alphon&s;o d'Alvarada, and precautions taken in con&s;equence, to keep me from the &s;ight of Agnes. To avow my pa&s;&s;ion for his daughter, and endeavour to make him enter into my &s;chemes, what I knew of Don Ga&s;ton's character convinced me would be an imprudent &s;tep; and con&s;idering it to be

e&s;&s;ential that he &s;hould know me for no other than the Conde de las Ci&s;ternas, I was determined not to let him hear the bravo's confe&s;&s;ion. I in&s;inuated to him, that as I &s;u&s;pected a lady to be concerned in the bu&s;i|ne&s;s, who&s;e name might accidentally e&s;cape from the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, it was nece&s;&s;ary for me to examine the man in private. Don Ga&s;ton's delicacy would not permit his urging the point any longer, and, in con&s;equence, the bravo was conveyed to my hotel.</P>
<P>The next morning I took leave of my ho&s;t, who was to return to the duke on the &s;ame day. My wounds had been &s;o trifling, that, except being obliged to wear my arm in a &s;ling for a &s;hort time, I felt no inconvenience from the night's adventure. The &s;ur|geon who examined the bravo's wound declared it to be mortal: he had ju&s;t time to confe&s;s that he had been in&s;tigated to murder me by the revengeful Donna Rodolpha, and expired in a few minutes after.</P>
<P>All my thoughts were now bent upon getting to the &s;peech of my lovely nun. Theodore &s;et him&s;elf to work, and, for this time, with better &s;ucce&s;s. He attacked the gardener of St. Clare &s;o forcibly with bribes and promi&s;es, that the old man was entirely gained over to my intere&s;ts; and it was &s;ettled that I &s;hould be introduced into the convent in the character of his a&s;&s;i&s;tant. The plan was put into execution without delay. Di&s;gui&s;ed in a common habit, and a black patch covering one of my eyes, I was pre&s;ented to the lady priore&s;s, who conde&s;cended to approve of the gardener's choice. I immediately entered upon my employment. Botany having been a favourite &s;tudy with me, I was by no means at a lo&s;s in my new
<PB N="213" REF="035729_0211_10065956298EE698">
&s;tation. For &s;ome days I continued to work in the convent garden without meeting the object of my di&s;|gui&s;e. On the fourth morning I was more &s;ucce&s;sful. I heard the voice of Agnes, and was &s;peeding towards the &s;ound, when the &s;ight of the domina &s;topped me. I drew back with caution, and concealed my&s;elf be|hind a thick clump of trees.</P>
<P>The priore&s;s advanced, and &s;eated her&s;elf with Ag|nes on a bench at no great di&s;tance. I heard her, in an angry tone, blame her companion's continual mel|ancholy. She told her, that to weep the lo&s;s of any lover, in her &s;ituation, was a crime; but that to weep the lo&s;s of a faithle&s;s one was folly and ab&s;urdity in the extreme. Agnes replied in &s;o low a voice that I could not di&s;tingui&s;h her words, but I perceived that &s;he u&s;ed terms of gentlene&s;s and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The conver&s;ation was interrupted by the arrival of a young pen&s;ioner, who informed the domina that &s;he was waited for in the parlour. The old lady ro&s;e, ki&s;&s;ed the cheek of Agnes, and retired. The new comer remained. Agnes &s;poke much to her in prai&s;e of &s;omebody whom I could not make out; but her audi|tor &s;eemed highly delighted and intere&s;ted by the con|ver&s;ation. The nun &s;hewed her &s;everal letters: the other peru&s;ed them with evident plea&s;ure, obtained permi&s;&s;ion to copy them, and withdrew for that pur|po&s;e to my great &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was &s;he out of &s;ight, than I quitted my concealment. Fearing to alarm my lovely mi&s;tre&s;s, I drew near her gently, intending to di&s;cover my&s;elf by degrees. But who for a moment can deceive the eyes of love? She rai&s;ed her head at my approach,
<PB N="214" REF="035729_0212_1006598F33898AE0">
and recogni&s;ed me, at a &s;ingle glance. She ro&s;e ha&s;t|ily from her &s;eat with an exclamation of &s;urpri&s;e, and attempted to retire: but I followed her, detained her, and entreated to be heard. Per&s;uaded of my fal&s;ehood, &s;he refu&s;ed to li&s;ten to me, and ordered me po&s;itively to quit the garden. It was now my turn to refu&s;e. I prote&s;ted that, however dangerous might be the con|&s;equences, I would not leave her till &s;he had heard my ju&s;tification. I a&s;&s;ured her, that &s;he had been deceiv|ed by the artifices of her relations; that I could con|vince her, beyond the power of doubt, that my pa&s;&s;ion had been pure and di&s;intere&s;ted; and I a&s;ked her what &s;hould induce me to &s;eek her in the convent, were I influenced by the &s;elfi&s;h motives which my enemies had a&s;cribed to me.</P>
<P>My prayers, my arguments, and vows not to quit her till &s;he had promi&s;ed to li&s;ten to me, united to her fears le&s;t the nuns &s;hould &s;ee me with her, to her nat|ural curio&s;ity, and to the affection which &s;he &s;till felt for me, in &s;pite of my &s;uppo&s;ed de&s;ertion, at length prevailed. She told me that to grant my reque&s;t at that moment was impo&s;&s;ible; but &s;he engaged to be in the &s;ame &s;pot at eleven that night, and to conver&s;e with me for the la&s;t time. Having obtained this promi&s;e, I relea&s;ed her hand, and &s;he fled back with rapidity towards the convent.</P>
<P>I communicated my &s;ucce&s;s to my ally, the old gardener: he pointed out an hiding place, where I might &s;helter my&s;elf till night without fear of a di&s;|covery. Thither I betook my&s;elf at the hour when I ought to have retired with my &s;uppo&s;ed ma&s;ter, and waited impatiently for the appointed time. The
<PB N="215" REF="035729_0213_10065958F4955D60">
chillne&s;s of the night was in my favour, &s;ince it kept the other nuns confined to their cells. Agnes alone was in&s;en&s;ible of the inclemency of the air, and, be|fore eleven, joined me at the &s;pot which had witne&s;&s;ed our former interview. Secure from interruption, I related to her the true cau&s;e of my di&s;appearing on the fatal fifth of May. She was evidently much affected by my narrative. When it was concluded, &s;he con|fe&s;&s;ed the inju&s;tice of her &s;u&s;picio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s, and blamed her|&s;elf for having taken the veil through de&s;pair at my ingratitude.</P>
<P>"But now it is too late to repine!" &s;he added; "the die is thrown: I have pronounced my vows, and dedicated my&s;elf to the &s;ervice of Heaven. I am &s;en&s;ible how ill I am calculated for a convent. My di&s;gu&s;t at a mona&s;tic life increa&s;es daily: ennui and di&s;content are my con&s;tant companions; and I will not conceal from you, that the pa&s;&s;ion which I former|ly felt for one &s;o near being my hu&s;band, is not yet extingui&s;hed in my bo&s;om: but we mu&s;t part! In|&s;uperable barriers divide us from each other, and on this &s;ide the grave we mu&s;t never meet again!"</P>
<P>I now exerted my&s;elf to prove, that our union was not &s;o impo&s;&s;ible as &s;he &s;eemed to think it. I vaunted to her the cardinal duke of Lerma's influence at the court of Rome. I a&s;&s;ured her, that I &s;hould ea&s;ily ob|tain a di&s;pen&s;ation from her vows; and I doubted not but Don Ga&s;ton would coincide with my views, when informed of my real name and long attachment. Agnes replied, that &s;ince I encouraged &s;uch an hope, I could know but little of her father. Liberal and kind in every other re&s;pect, &s;uper&s;tition formed the only
<PB N="216" REF="035729_0214_10065990C1024530">
&s;tain upon his character. Upon this head he was in|flexible: he &s;acrificed his deare&s;t intere&s;ts to his &s;cru|ples, and would con&s;ider it an in&s;ult to &s;uppo&s;e him capable of authorizing his daughter to break her vows to Heaven.</P>
<P>"But &s;uppo&s;e," &s;aid I, interrupting her, "&s;uppo&s;e that he &s;hould di&s;approve of our union: let him re|main ignorant of my proceedings till I have re&s;cued you from the pri&s;on in which you are now confined. Once my wife, you are free from his authority. I need from him no pecuniary a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and when he &s;ees his re&s;entment to be unavailing, he will doubtle&s;s re&s;tore you to his favour. But, let the wor&s;t happen; &s;hould Don Ga&s;ton be irreconcileable, my relations will vie with each other in making you forget his lo&s;s; and you will find in my father a &s;ub&s;titute for the parent of whom I &s;hall deprive you."</P>
<P>"Don Raymond," replied Agnes, in a firm and re&s;|olute voice, "I love my father: he has treated me har&s;hly in this one in&s;tance; but I have received from him, in every other, &s;o many proofs of love, that his affection is become nece&s;&s;ary to my exi&s;tence. Were I to quit the convent, he never would forgive me; nor can I think that, on his death bed, he would leave me his cur&s;e, without &s;huddering at the very idea. Be&s;ides, I am con&s;cious my&s;elf, that my vows are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. Wilfully did I contract my engagement with Heaven: I cannot break it without a crime. Then bani&s;h from your mind the idea of our being ever unit|ed. I am devoted to religion; and however I may grieve at our &s;eparation, I would oppo&s;e ob&s;tacles my|&s;elf to what I feel would render me guilty."</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="035729_0215_1006595A81C8BDC8">
I &s;trove to overrule the&s;e ill grounded &s;cruples. We were &s;till di&s;puting upon the &s;ubject, when the con|vent bell &s;ummoned the nuns to matins. Agnes was obliged to attend the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> but &s;he left me not till I had compelled her to promi&s;e, that on the following night &s;he would be at the &s;ame place at the &s;ame hour. The&s;e meetings continued for &s;everal weeks uninter|rupted: and 'tis now, Lorenzo, that I mu&s;t implore your indulgence. Reflect upon our &s;ituation, our youth, our long attachment. Weigh all the circum|&s;tances which attended our a&s;&s;ignations, and you will confe&s;s the temptation to have been irre&s;i&s;tible; you will even pardon me when I acknowledge that, in an unguarded moment, the honor of Agnes was &s;acrificed to my pa&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>[Lorenzo's eyes &s;parkled with fury; a deep crim|&s;on &s;pread it&s;elf over his face: he &s;tarted from his &s;eat, and attempted to draw his &s;word. The marquis was aware of his movement, and caught his hand: he pre&s;&s;ed it affectionately:</P>
<P>"My friend! my brother! hear me to the conclu|&s;ion! Till then re&s;train your pa&s;&s;ion; and be at lea&s;t convinced, that if what I have related is criminal, the blame mu&s;t fall upon me, and not upon your &s;i&s;ter."</P>
<P>Lorenzo &s;uffered him&s;elf to be prevailed upon by Don Raymond's entreaties: he re&s;umed his place, and li&s;tened to the re&s;t of the narrative with a gloomy and impatient countenance. The marquis thus con|tinued:]</P>
<P>Scarcely was the fir&s;t bur&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion pa&s;t, when Agnes, recovering her&s;elf, &s;tarted from my arms with

horror. She called me infamous &s;educer, loaded me with the bittere&s;t reproaches, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eat her bo&s;om in all the wildne&s;s of delirium. A&s;hamed of my impru|dence, I with difficulty found words to excu&s;e my|&s;elf. I endeavoured to con&s;ole her: I threw my&s;elf at her feet, and entreated her forgivene&s;s. She forced her hand from me, which I had taken and would have pre&s;&s;ed to my lips.</P>
<P>"To<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ch me not!" &s;he cried, with a violence which terrified me. "Mon&s;ter of perfidy and ingratitude, how have I been deceived in you! I looked upon you as my friend, my protector; I tru&s;ted my&s;elf in your hands with confidence, and, relying upon your honor, thought that mine ran no ri&s;k: and 'tis by you, whom I adored, that I am covered with infamy! 'Tis by you that I have been &s;educed into breaking my vows to God, that I am reduced to a level with the ba&s;e&s;t of my &s;ex! Shame upon you, villain, you &s;hall never &s;ee me more!"</P>
<P>She &s;tarted from the bank on which &s;he was &s;eated. I endeavoured to detain her; but &s;he di&s;engaged her|&s;elf from me with violence, and took refuge in the convent.</P>
<P>I retired, filled with confu&s;ion and inquietude. The next morning I failed not, as u&s;ual, to appear in the garden; but Agnes was no where to be &s;een. At night I waited for her at the place where we generally met. I found no better &s;ucce&s;s. Several days and nights pa&s;&s;ed away in the &s;ame manner. At length I &s;aw my offended mi&s;tre&s;s cro&s;s the walk, on who&s;e borders I was working: &s;he was accompanied by the &s;ame young pen&s;ioner, on who&s;e arm &s;he &s;eemed, from

weakne&s;s, obliged to &s;upport her&s;elf. She looked upon me for a moment, but in&s;tantly turned her head away. I waited her return; but &s;he pa&s;&s;ed on to the convent without paying any attention to me, or the penitent looks with which I implored her forgivene&s;s.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the nuns were retired, the old gardener joined me with a &s;orrowful air.</P>
<P>"Segnor," &s;aid he, "it grieves me to &s;ay, that I can be no longer of u&s;e to you; the lady whom you u&s;ed to meet has ju&s;t a&s;&s;ured me, that if I admitted you again into the garden, &s;he would di&s;cover the whole bu&s;ine&s;s to the lady priore&s;s. She bade me tell you al&s;o, that your pre&s;ence was an in&s;ult, and that, if you &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;s the lea&s;t re&s;pect for her, you will never attempt to &s;ee her more. Excu&s;e me then for informing you, that I can favour your di&s;gui&s;e no longer. Should the priore&s;s be acquainted with my conduct, &s;he might not be contented with di&s;mi&s;&s;ing me her &s;ervice: out of revenge, &s;he might accu&s;e me of having profaned the convent, and cau&s;e me to be thrown into the pri&s;ons of the Inqui&s;ition."</P>
<P>Fruitle&s;s were my attempts to conquer his re&s;olu|tion. He denied me all future entrance into the gar|den; and Agnes per&s;evered in neither letting me &s;ee or hear from her. In about a fortnight after, a vio|lent illne&s;s which had &s;eized my father obliged me to &s;et out for Andalu&s;ia. I ha&s;tened thither, and, as I imagined, found the marquis at the point of death. Though, on its fir&s;t appearance, his complaint was declared mortal, he lingered out &s;everal months; dur|ing which, my attendance upon him in his malady, and the occupation of &s;ettling his affairs after his de|cea&s;e,

permitted not my quitting Andalu&s;ia. Within the&s;e four days I returned to Madrid, and, on arriving at my hot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, I there found this letter waiting for me.</P>
<P>[Here the marquis unlocked a drawer of a cabinet; he took out a folded paper, which he pre&s;ented to his auditor. Lorenzo opened it, and recogni&s;ed his &s;i&s;ter's hand. The contents were as follows:</P>

<P>INTO what an aby&s;s of mi&s;ery have you plunged me! Raymond, you force me to become as crimi|nal as your&s;elf. I had re&s;olved never to &s;ee you more; if po&s;&s;ible, to forget you; if not, only to re|member you with hate. A being, for whom I al|ready feel a mother's tenderne&s;s, &s;olicits me to par|don my &s;educer, and apply to his love for the means of pre&s;ervation. Raymond, your child lives in my bo&s;om. I tremble at the vengeance of the priore&s;s. I tremble much for my&s;elf, yet more for the inno|cent creature who&s;e exi&s;tence depends upon mine. Both of us are lo&s;t, &s;hould my &s;ituation be di&s;cover|ed. Advi&s;e me, then, what &s;teps to take, but &s;eek not to &s;ee me. The gardener, who undertakes to deliver this, is di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and we have nothing to hope from that quarter. The man engaged in his place is of incorruptible fidelity. The be&s;t means of conveying to me your an&s;wer, is by concealing it under the great &s;tatue of St. Francis, which &s;tands in the Capuchin cathedral; thither I go every Thur&s;day to confe&s;&s;ion, and &s;hall ea&s;ily have an op|portunity of &s;ecuring your letter. I hear that you are now ab&s;ent from Madrid. Need I entreat you to write the very moment of your return? I will not think it. Ah! Raymond! mine is a cruel &s;itu|ation!
<PB N="221" REF="035729_0219_1006595ED3ED6CD8">
Deceived by my neare&s;t relations, compelled to embrace a profe&s;&s;ion the duties of which I am ill calculated to perform, con&s;cious of the &s;anctity of tho&s;e duties, and &s;educed into violating them by one whom I lea&s;t &s;u&s;pected of perfidy, I am now oblig|ed, by circum&s;tances, to choo&s;e between death and perjury. Woman's timidity, and maternal affec|tion, permit me not to balance in the choice. I feel all the guilt into which I plunge my&s;elf when I yield to the plan which you before propo&s;ed to me. My poor father's death, which has taken place &s;ince we met, has removed one ob&s;tacle. He &s;leeps in his grave, and I no longer dread his anger. But from the anger of God, oh! Raymond! who &s;hall &s;hield me? Who can protect me again&s;t my con&s;cience, again&s;t my&s;elf? I dare not dwell upon the&s;e thoughts; they will drive me mad. I have taken my re&s;olution.

earne&s;tly de&s;ired, &s;o little expected. My plan was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oon arranged. When Don Ga&s;ton di&s;covered to me his daughter's retreat, I entertained no doubt of her readine&s;s to quit the convent: I had, therefore, en|tru&s;ted the cardinal duke of Lerma with the whole affair, who immediately bu&s;ied him&s;elf in obtaining the nece&s;&s;ary bull. Fortunately, I had afterwards neglected to &s;top his proceedings. Not long &s;ince I received a letter from him, &s;tating that he expected daily to receive the order from the court of Rome. Upon this I would willingly have relied; but the car|dinal wrote me word, that I mu&s;t find &s;ome means of conveying Agnes out of the convent, unknown to the priore&s;s. He doubted not but this latter would be much incen&s;ed by loo&s;ing a per&s;on of &s;uch high rank from her &s;ociety, and con&s;ider the renunciation of Ag|nes as an in&s;ult to her hou&s;e. He repre&s;ented her as a woman of a violent and revengeful character, capa|ble of proceeding to the greate&s;t extremities. It was therefore to be feared le&s;t, by confining Agnes in the convent, &s;he &s;hould fru&s;trate my hopes, and render the pope's mandate unavailing. Influenced by this con&s;id|eration, I re&s;olved to carry off my mi&s;tre&s;s, and conceal her in the cardinal duke's e&s;tate till the arrival of the expected bull. He approved of my de&s;ign, and profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf ready to give a &s;helter to the fugitive. I next cau&s;ed the new gardener of St. Clare to be &s;eized pri|vately, and confined in my hotel. By this means I became ma&s;ter of the key to the garden door, and I had now nothing more to do than prepare Agnes for the elopement. This was done by the letter which you &s;aw me deliver this evening. I told her in it, that I &s;hould be ready to receive her at twelve to-morrow

<P>You have now, Lorenzo, heard the whole of my long narrative.

<P>HERE the marquis concluded his adventures. Lo|renzo, before he could determine on his reply, pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome moments in reflection. At length he broke &s;ilence.</P>

What has pa&s;&s;ed between you cannot be recalled, but may yet be repaired by uniting you to my &s;i&s;ter. You have ever been, you &s;till con|tinue to be, my deare&s;t, and indeed, my only friend. I feel for Agnes the true&s;t affection, and there is no one on whom I would be&s;tow her more willingly than on your&s;elf. Pur&s;ue, then, your de&s;ign. I will ac|company you to-morrow night, and conduct her my|&s;elf to the hou&s;e of the cardinal. My pre&s;ence will be a &s;anction for her conduct, and prevent her incurr|ing blame by her flight from the convent."</P>
<P>The marquis thanked him in terms by no means deficient in gratitude. Lorenzo then informed him
<PB N="225" REF="035729_0223_100659644B40D048">
that he had nothing more to apprehend from Donna Rodolpha's enmity. Five months had already elap&s;ed &s;ince, in an exce&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion, &s;he broke a blood ve&s;&s;el, and expired in the cour&s;e of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ew hours. He then proceeded to mention the intere&s;ts of Antonia. The marquis was much &s;urpri&s;ed at hearing of this new relation. His father had carried his hatred of Elvira to the grave, and had never given the lea&s;t hint that he knew what was become of his elde&s;t &s;on's widow. Don Raymond a&s;&s;ured his friend, that he was not mi&s;taken in &s;uppo&s;ing him ready to acknow|ledge his &s;i&s;ter-in-law, and her amiable daughter. The preparations for the elopement would not permit his vi&s;iting them the next day; but in the mean while, he de&s;ired Lorenzo to a&s;&s;ure them of his friend&s;hip, and to &s;upply Elvira, upon his account, with any &s;ums which &s;he might want. This the youth promi&s;ed to do, as &s;oon as her abode &s;hould be known to him. He then took leave of his future brother, and returned to the palace de Medina.</P>
<P>The day was already on the point of breaking when the marquis retired to his chamber. Con&s;cious that his narrative would take up &s;ome hours, and wi&s;hing to &s;ecure him&s;elf from interruption, on returning to the hotel he ordered his attendants not to fit up for him; con&s;equently, he was &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ed, on entering his anti-room, to find Theodore e&s;tabli&s;hed there. The page &s;at near a table, with a pen in his hand, and was &s;o totally occupied by his employment, that he perceived not his lord's approach. The mar|quis &s;topped to ob&s;erve him. Theodore wrote a few lines, then pau&s;ed and &s;cratched out a part of the writ|ing; then wrote again, &s;miled, and &s;eemed highly

plea&s;ed with what he had been about. At la&s;t he threw down his pen, &s;prang from his chair, and clap|ped his hands together joyfully.</P>
<P>"There it is!" cried he aloud: "now they are charming!"</P>
<P>His tran&s;ports were interrupted by a laugh from the marquis, who &s;u&s;pected the nature of his employ|ment.</P>
<P>"What is &s;o charming, Theodore?"</P>
<P>The youth &s;tarted, and looked round: he blu&s;hed, ran to the table, &s;eized the paper on which he had been writing, and concealed it in confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>"Oh! my lord, I knew not that you were &s;o near me. Can I be of u&s;e to you? Lucas is already gone to bed."</P>
<P>"I &s;hall follow his example when I have given my opinion of your ver&s;es."</P>
<P>"My ver&s;es, my lord!"</P>
<P>"Nay I am &s;ure that you have been writing &s;ome, for nothing el&s;e could have kept you awake till this time in the morning. Where are they, Theodore? I &s;hall like to &s;ee your compo&s;ition."</P>
<P>Theodore's cheeks glowed with &s;till deeper crim&s;on: he longed to &s;hew his poetry, but fir&s;t cho&s;e to be pre&s;&s;|ed for it.</P>
<P>"Indeed, my lord, they are not worthy your at|tention."</P>

"Not the&s;e ver&s;es, which you ju&s;t now declared to be &s;o charming? Come, come, let me &s;ee whether our opinions are the &s;ame. I promi&s;e that you &s;hall find in me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n indulgent critic."</P>
<P>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> produced his paper with &s;eeming reluc|tance; but the &s;atisfaction which &s;parkled in his dark expre&s;&s;ive eyes betrayed the vanity of his youthful bo|&s;om.

<P>The marquis returned the paper with a &s;mile of en|couragement.</P>
<P>"Your little poem plea&s;es me much," &s;aid he: "however, you mu&s;t not count my opinion for any
<PB N="231" REF="035729_0229_1006596923D6B2A8">
thing. I am no judge of ver&s;es, and for my own part never compo&s;ed more than &s;ix lines in my life: tho&s;e &s;ix produced &s;o unlucky an effect, that I am fully re|&s;olved never to compo&s;e another. But I wander from my &s;ubject. I was going to &s;ay that you cannot em|ploy your time wor&s;e than in making ver&s;es. An author, whether good or bad, or between both, is an animal whom every body is privileged to attack: for though all are not able to write books, all conceive them&s;elves able to judge them. A bad compo&s;ition carries with it its own puni&s;hment&mdash;contempt and ridicule. A good one excites envy, and entails upon its author a thou&s;and mortifications: he finds him&s;elf a&s;&s;ailed by partial and ill humoured critici&s;m: one man finds fault with the plan, another with the &s;tyle, a third with the precept which it &s;trives to inculcate; and they who cannot &s;ucceed in finding fault with the book, employ them&s;elves in &s;tigmatizing its author. They maliciou&s;ly rake out from ob&s;curity every little circum&s;tance which may throw ridicule upon his pri|vate character or conduct, and aim at wounding the man &s;ince they cannot hurt the writer. In &s;hort, to enter the li&s;ts of literature is wilfully to expo&s;e your|&s;elf to the arrows of neglect, ridicule, envy, and di&s;|appointment. Whether you write well or ill, be a&s;|&s;ured that you will not e&s;cape from blame. Indeed this circum&s;tance contains a young author's chief con|&s;olation: he remembers that Lope de Vega and Cal|derona had unju&s;t and envious critics, and he mode&s;tly conceives him&s;elf to be exactly in their predicament. But I am con&s;cious that all the&s;e &s;age ob&s;ervations are thrown away upon you. Author&s;hip is a mania, to conquer which, no rea&s;ons are &s;ufficiently &s;trong; and you might as ea&s;ily per&s;uade me not to love, as I
<PB N="232" REF="035729_0230_100659A1B8CB8D00">
per&s;uade you not to write. However, if you cannot help being occa&s;ionally &s;eized with a poetical par|oxy&s;m, take at lea&s;t the precaution of communicating your ver&s;es to none but tho&s;e who&s;e partiality for you &s;ecures their approbation."</P>
<P>"Then, my lord, you do not think the&s;e lines tol|erable?" &s;aid Theodore, with an humble and dejected air.</P>
<P>"You mi&s;take my meaning. As I &s;aid before, they have plea&s;ed me much: but my regard for you makes me partial, and others might judge them le&s;s favourably. I mu&s;t &s;till remark, that even my preju|dice in your favour does not blind me &s;o much as to prevent my ob&s;erving &s;everal faults. For in&s;tance, you make a terrible confu&s;ion of metaphors; you are too apt to make the &s;trength of your lines con&s;i&s;t more in the words than &s;en&s;e; &s;ome of the ver&s;es &s;eem intro|duced only in order to rhyme with others; and mo&s;t of the be&s;t ideas are borrowed from other poets, though po&s;&s;ibly you are uncon&s;cious of the theft your&s;elf. The&s;e faults may occa&s;ionally be excu&s;ed in a work of length; but a &s;hort poem mu&s;t be correct and per|fect."</P>
<P>"All this is true, Segnor; but you &s;hould con&s;ider that I only write for plea&s;ure."</P>
<P>"Your defects are the le&s;s excu&s;eable. Their in|correctne&s;s may be forgiven, who work for money, who are obliged to complete a given ta&s;k in a given time, and are paid according to the bulk, not value, of their productions. But in tho&s;e whom no nece&s;&s;ity forces to turn author, who merely write for fame, and
<PB N="233" REF="035729_0231_1006596CED64C210">
have full lei&s;ure to poli&s;h their compo&s;itions, faults are unpardonable, and merit the &s;harpe&s;t arrows of criti|ci&s;m."</P>
<P>The marquis ro&s;e from the &s;ofa; the page looked di&s;couraged and melancholy; and this did not e&s;cape his ma&s;ter's ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>"However," added he &s;miling, "I think that the&s;e lines do you no di&s;credit. Your ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ification is toler|ably ea&s;y, and your ear &s;eems to be ju&s;t. The peru|&s;al of your little poem upon the whole gave me much plea&s;ure; and if it is not a&s;king too great a favour, I &s;hall be highly obliged to you for a copy."</P>
<P>The youth's countenance immediately cleared up. He perceived not the &s;mile, half approving, half iron|ical, which accompanied the reque&s;t, and he promi&s;ed the copy with great readine&s;s. The marquis with|drew to his chamber, much amu&s;ed by the in&s;tanta|neous effect produced upon Theodore's vanity by the conclu&s;ion of his critici&s;m. He threw him&s;elf upon his couch, &s;leep &s;oon &s;tole over him, and his dreams pre&s;ented him with the mo&s;t flattering pictures of hap|pine&s;s with Agnes.</P>
<P>On reaching the hotel de Medina, Lorenzo's fir&s;t care was to inquire for letters. He found &s;everal waiting for him; but that which he &s;ought was not among&s;t them. Leonella had found it impo&s;&s;ible to write that evening. However, her impatience to &s;e|cure Don Chri&s;toval's heart, on which &s;he flattered her&s;elf with having made no &s;light impre&s;&s;ion, per|mitted her not to pa&s;s another day without informing him where &s;he was to be found. On her return from
<PB N="234" REF="035729_0232_100659A35BFCEAC0">
the Capuchin church, &s;he had related to her &s;i&s;ter, with exultation, how attentive an hand&s;ome cavalier had been to her; as al&s;o how his companion had un|dertaken to plead Antonia's cau&s;e with the marquis de las Ci&s;ternas. Elvira received this intelligence with &s;en&s;ations very different from tho&s;e with which it was communicated. She blamed her &s;i&s;ter's im|prudence in confiding her hi&s;tory to an ab&s;olute &s;tran|ger, and expre&s;&s;ed her fears le&s;t this incon&s;iderate &s;tep &s;hould prejudice the marquis again&s;t her. The great|e&s;t of her apprehen&s;ions &s;he concealed in her own brea&s;t. She had ob&s;erved with inquietude, that at the mention of Lorenzo a deep blu&s;h &s;pread it&s;elf over her daughter's cheek. The timid Antonia dared not to pronounce his name. Without knowing wherefore, &s;he felt embarra&s;&s;ed when he was made the &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e, and endeavoured to change the conver&s;ation to Ambro&s;io. Elvira perceived the emotions of this young bo&s;om: in con&s;equence, &s;he in&s;i&s;ted upon Leo|nella's breaking her promi&s;e to the cavaliers. A &s;igh, which on hearing this order e&s;caped from Antonia, confirmed the wary mother in her re&s;olution.</P>
<P>Through this re&s;olution Leonella was determined to break: &s;he conceived it to be in&s;pired by envy, and that her &s;i&s;ter dreaded her being elevated above her. Without imparting her de&s;ign to any one, &s;he took an opportunity of di&s;patching the following note to Lo|renzo: it was delivered to him as &s;oon as he awoke:</P>

<P>Lorenzo had no &s;ooner peru&s;ed this note, than he &s;et out in &s;earch of Don Chri&s;toval. Not being able to find him in the cour&s;e of the day, he proceeded to Donna Elvira's alone, to Leonella's infinite di&s;appoint|ment.

That reluctance was increa&s;ed by the changes which his approach pro|duced in Antonia's countenance; nor was it by any means abated, when the youth him&s;elf appeared. The &s;ymmetry of his per&s;on, animation of his features, and natural elegance of his manners and addre&s;s, convinced Elvira that &s;uch a gue&s;t mu&s;t be dangerous for her daughter. She re&s;olved to treat him with di&s;tant po|litene&s;s, to decline his &s;ervices with gratitude for the tender of them, and to make him feel, without offence, that his future vi&s;its would be far from acceptable.</P>
<P>On his entrance he found Elvira, who was indi&s;|po&s;ed, reclining upon a &s;ofa; Antonia &s;at by her em|broidery frame; and Leonella in a pa&s;toral dre&s;s, held <HI>"Montemayor's Diana."</HI> In &s;pite of her being the mother of Antonia, Lorenzo could not help expect|ing to find in Elvira, Leonella's true &s;i&s;ter and the daughter of "as hone&s;t a pains-taking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> as any in Cordova." A &s;ingle glance was &s;ufficient to undeceive him. He beheld a woman who&s;e features, though impaired by time and &s;orrow, &s;till bore the marks of di&s;tingui&s;hed beauty: a &s;erious dignity reign|ed upon her countenance, but was tempered by a grace and &s;weetne&s;s which rendered her truly enchant|ing. Lorenzo fancied that &s;he mu&s;t have re&s;embled her daughter in her youth, and readily excu&s;ed the im|prudence of the late Cond&eacute; de las Ci&s;ternas. She de|&s;ired him to be &s;eated, and immediately re&s;umed her place upon the &s;ofa.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="035729_0235_100659701EB17F88">
Antonia received him with a &s;imple reverence, and continued her work: her cheeks were &s;uffu&s;ed with crim&s;on, and &s;he &s;trove to conceal her emotion by leaning over her embroidery frame. Her aunt al&s;o cho&s;e to play off her airs of mode&s;ty: &s;he affected to blu&s;h and tremble, and waited with her eyes ca&s;t down to receive, as &s;he expected, the compliments of Don Chri&s;toval. Finding, after &s;ome time, that no &s;ign of his approach was given, &s;he ventured to look round the room, and perceived with vexation that Me|dina was unaccompanied. Impatience would not permit her waiting for an explanation: interrupting Lorenzo, who was delivering Raymond's me&s;&s;age, &s;he de&s;ired to know what was become of his friend.</P>
<P>He, who thought it nece&s;&s;ary to maintain him&s;elf in her good graces, &s;trove to con&s;ole her under her di&s;ap|pointment by committing a little violence upon truth.</P>
<P>"Ah! Segnora," he replied in a melancholy voice, how grieved will he be at lo&s;ing this opportunity of paying you his re&s;pects! A relation's illne&s;s has oblig|ed him to quit Madrid in ha&s;te: but on his return he will doubtle&s;s &s;eize the fir&s;t moment with tran&s;port to throw him&s;elf at your feet!</P>
<P>As he &s;aid this, his eyes met tho&s;e of Elvira: &s;he puni&s;hed his fal&s;ehood &s;ufficiently by darting at him a look expre&s;&s;ive of di&s;plea&s;ure and reproach. Neither did the deceit an&s;wer his intention. Vexed and di&s;|appointed, Leonella ro&s;e from her &s;eat, and retired in dudgeon to her own apartment.</P>
<P>Lorenzo ha&s;tened to repair the fault which had in|jured him in Elvira's opinion. He related his conver|&s;ation
<PB N="238" REF="035729_0236_100659A8E8153EE8">
with the marquis re&s;pecting her: he a&s;&s;ured her that Raymond was prepared to acknowledge her for his brother's widow; and that, till it was in his power to pay his compliments to her in per&s;on, Lorenzo was commi&s;&s;ioned to &s;upply his place. This intelligence relieved Elvira from an heavy weight of unea&s;ine&s;s: &s;he had now found a protector for the fatherle&s;s An|tonia, for who&s;e future fortunes &s;he had &s;uffered the greate&s;t apprehen&s;ions. She was not &s;paring of her thanks to him who had interfered &s;o generou&s;ly in her behalf: but &s;till &s;he gave him no invitation to repeat his vi&s;it. However, when upon ri&s;ing to depart he reque&s;ted permi&s;&s;ion to inquire after her health occa|&s;ionally, the polite earne&s;tne&s;s of his manner, gratitude for his &s;ervices, and re&s;pect for his friend the marquis, would not admit of a refu&s;al. She con&s;ented reluc|tantly to receive him: he promi&s;ed not to abu&s;e her goodne&s;s, and quitted the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Antonia was now left alone with her mother: a temporary &s;ilence en&s;ued. Both wi&s;hed to &s;peak up|on the &s;ame &s;ubject, but neither new how to intro|duce it. The one felt a ba&s;hfulne&s;s which &s;ealed up her lips, and for which &s;he could not account; the other feared to find her apprehen&s;ions true, or to in|&s;pire her daughter with notions to which &s;he might &s;till be a &s;tranger. At length Elvira began the con|ver&s;ation.</P>
<P>"That is a charming young man, Antonia; I am much plea&s;ed with him. Was he long near you ye&s;|terday in the cathedral?"</P>
<P>"He quitted me not for a moment while I &s;taid in the church: he gave me his &s;eat, and was very oblig|ing and attentive."</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="035729_0237_10065971C766BEB0">
"Indeed? Why then have you never mentioned his name to me? Your aunt launched out in prai&s;e of his friend, and you vaunted Ambro&s;io's eloquence: but neither &s;aid a word of Don Lorenzo's per&s;on and ac|compli&s;hments. Had not Leonella &s;poken of his readine&s;s to undertake our cau&s;e, I &s;hould not have known him to be in exi&s;tence."</P>
<P>She pau&s;ed. Antonia coloured, but was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>"Perhaps you judge him le&s;s favourably than I do. In my opinion his figure is plea&s;ing, his conver&s;ation &s;en&s;ible, and manners engaging. Still he may have &s;truck you differently: you may think him di&s;agreea|ble, and&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Di&s;agreeable? Oh! dear mother, how &s;hould I po&s;&s;ibly think him &s;o? I &s;hould be very ungrateful were I not &s;en&s;ible of his kindne&s;s ye&s;terday, and very blind if his merits had e&s;caped me. His figure is &s;o graceful, &s;o noble! His manners &s;o gentle, yet &s;o manly! I never yet &s;aw &s;o many accompli&s;hments united in one per&s;on, and I doubt whether Madrid can produce his equal."</P>
<P>"Why then were you &s;o &s;ilent in prai&s;e of this phoenix of Madrid? Why was it concealed from me, that his &s;ociety had afforded you plea&s;ure?"</P>
<P>"In truth, I know not; you a&s;k me a que&s;tion which I cannot re&s;olve my&s;elf. I was on the point of mentioning him a thou&s;and times; his name was con|&s;tantly on my lips; but when I would have pronoun|ced it, I wanted courage to execute my de&s;ign. How|ever, if I did not &s;peak of him, it was not that I thought of him the le&s;s."</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="035729_0238_100659AA6F8CF558">
"That I believe. But &s;hall I tell you why you wanted courage? It was becau&s;e, accu&s;tomed to con|fide to me your mo&s;t &s;ecret thoughts, you knew not how to conceal, yet feared to acknowledge, that your heart nouri&s;hed a &s;entiment which you were con|&s;cious I &s;hould di&s;approve. Come hither to me, my child."</P>
<P>Antonia quitted her embroidery frame, threw her|&s;elf upon her knees by the &s;ofa, and hid her face in her mother's lap.</P>
<P>"Fear not, my &s;weet girl! Con&s;ider me equally as your friend and parent, and apprehend no reproof from me. I have read the emotions of your bo&s;om; you are yet ill &s;killed in concealing them, and they could not e&s;cape my attentive eye. This Lorenzo is dangerous to your repo&s;e; he has already made an impre&s;&s;ion upon your heart. 'Tis true that I perceive ea&s;ily that your affection is returned: but what can be the con&s;equences of this attachment? You are poor and friendle&s;s, my Antonia; Lorenzo is the heir of the duke of Medina Celi. Even &s;hould him&s;elf mean honourably, his uncle never will con&s;ent to your union; nor, without that uncle's con&s;ent, will I. By &s;ad experience I know what &s;orrow &s;he mu&s;t endure, who marries into a family unwilling to receive her. Then &s;truggle with your affection: whatever pains it may co&s;t you, &s;trive to conquer it. Your heart is ten|der and &s;u&s;ceptible: it has already received a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion; but when once convinced that you &s;hould not encourage &s;uch &s;entiments, I tru&s;t that you have &s;ufficient fortitude to drive them from your bo&s;om."</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="035729_0239_1006597597F7B248">
Antonia ki&s;&s;ed her hand, and promi&s;ed implicit obedience. Elvira then continued&mdash;</P>
<P>"To prevent your pa&s;&s;ion from growing &s;tronger, it will be needful to prohibit Lorenzo's vi&s;its. The &s;ervice which he has rendered me permits not my for|bidding them po&s;itively; but unle&s;s I judge too fa|vourably of his character, he will di&s;continue them without taking offence, if I confe&s;s to him my rea&s;ons, and throw my&s;elf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ntirely on his genero&s;ity.

<P>Antonia &s;ub&s;cribed to every thing without he&s;itation, though not without regret. Her mother ki&s;&s;ed her af|fectionately, and retired to bed.

<P>While this was pa&s;&s;ing at Elvira's, Lorenzo ha&s;ten|ed to rejoin the marquis. Every thing was ready for the &s;econd elopement of Agnes; and at twelve the two friends with a coach and four were at the garden wall of the convent. Don Raymond drew out his
<PB N="242" REF="035729_0240_100659ABF7116980">
key, and unlocked the door. They entered, and wait|ed for &s;ome time in expectation of being joined by Agnes. At length the marquis grew impatient: be|ginning to fear that his &s;econd attempt would &s;ucceed no better than the fir&s;t, he propo&s;ed to reconnoitre the convent. The friends advanced towards it. Every thing was &s;till and dark. The priore&s;s was anxious to keep the &s;tory a &s;ecret, fearing le&s;t the crime of one of its members &s;hould bring di&s;grace upon the whole community, or that the interpo&s;ition of powerful rela|tions &s;hould deprive her vengeance of its intended vic|tim. She took care therefore to give the lover of Ag|nes no cau&s;e to &s;uppo&s;e that his de&s;ign was di&s;covered, and his mi&s;tre&s;s on the point of &s;uffering the puni&s;h|ment of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fault. The &s;ame rea&s;on made her reject the idea of arre&s;ting the unknown &s;educer in the gar|den: &s;uch a proceeding would have created much di&s;|turbance, and the di&s;grace of her convent would have been noi&s;ed about Madrid. She contented her&s;elf with confining Agnes clo&s;ely: as to the lover, &s;he left him at liberty to pur&s;ue his de&s;igns. What &s;he expected was the re&s;ult. The marquis and Lorenzo waited in vain till the break of day; they then retired without noi&s;e, alarmed at the failure of their plan, and igno|rant of the cau&s;e of its ill &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The next morning Lorenzo went to the convent, and reque&s;ted to &s;ee his &s;i&s;ter. The priore&s;s appeared at the grate with a melancholy countenance. She in|formed him that for &s;everal days Agnes had appeared much agitated; that &s;he had been pre&s;&s;ed by the nuns in vain to reveal the cau&s;e, and apply to their tender|ne&s;s for advice and con&s;olation; that &s;he had ob&s;ti|nately per&s;i&s;ted in concealing the cau&s;e of her di&s;tre&s;s;
<PB N="243" REF="035729_0241_10065978A5604C60">
but that on Thur&s;day evening it had produced &s;o vio|lent an effect upon her con&s;titution, that &s;he had fallen ill, and was actually confined to her bed. Lorenzo did not credit a &s;yllable of this account: he in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;eeing his &s;i&s;ter; if &s;he was unable to come to the grate, he de&s;ired to be admitted to her cell. The priore&s;s cro&s;&s;ed her&s;elf! &s;he was &s;hocked at the very idea of a man's profane eye pervading the interior of her holy man&s;ion, and profe&s;&s;ed her&s;elf a&s;toni&s;hed that Lorenzo could think of &s;uch a thing. She told him that his reque&s;t could not be granted; but that, if he returned the next day, &s;he hoped that her beloved daughter would then be &s;ufficiently recovered to join him at the parlour grate. With this an&s;wer Lorenzo was obliged to retire, un&s;atisfied, and trembling for his &s;i&s;ter's &s;afety.</P>
<P>He returned the next morning at an early hour. "Agnes was wor&s;e; the phy&s;ician had pronounce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> her to be in imminent danger; &s;he was ordered to re|main quiet, and it was utterly impo&s;&s;ible for her to re|ceive her brother's vi&s;it." Lorenzo &s;tormed at this an&s;wer, but there was no re&s;ource. He raved, he en|treated, he threatened; no means were left untried to obtain a &s;ight of Agnes. His endeavours were as fruitle&s;s as tho&s;e of the day before, and he returned in de&s;pair to the marquis. On his &s;ide, the latter had &s;pared no pains to di&s;cover what had occa&s;ioned his plot to fail. Don Chri&s;toval, to whom the affair was now entru&s;ted, endeavoured to worm out the &s;ecret from the old portere&s;s of St. Clare, with whom he had formed an acquaintance; but &s;he was too much upon her guard, and he gained from her no intelligence. The marquis was almo&s;t di&s;tracted, and Lorenzo <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;carcely le&s;s inquietude. Both were convince<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="244" REF="035729_0242_100659771DF75F18">
the purpo&s;ed elopement mu&s;t have been di&s;covered: they doubted not but the malady of Agnes was a pre|tence, but they knew not by what means to re&s;cue her from the hands of the priore&s;s.</P>
<P>Regularly every day did Lorenzo vi&s;it the convent: as regularly was he informed that his &s;i&s;ter rather grew wor&s;e than better. Certain that her indi&s;po&s;ition was feigned, the&s;e accounts did not alarm him: but his ignorance of her fate, and of the motives which induc|ed the priore&s;s to keep her from him, excited the mo&s;t &s;erious unea&s;ine&s;s. He was &s;till uncertain what &s;teps he ought to take, when the marquis received a letter from the cardinal duke of Lerma. It enclo&s;ed the pope's expected bull, ordering that Agnes &s;hould be relea&s;ed from her vows, and re&s;tored to her relations. This e&s;&s;ential paper decided at once the proceedings of her friends; they re&s;olved that Lorenzo &s;hould carry it to the domina without delay, and demand that his &s;i&s;ter &s;hould be in&s;tantly given up to him. Again&s;t this mandate illne&s;s could not be pleaded: it gave her brother the power of removing her in&s;tantly to the palace de Medina, and he determined to u&s;e that power on the following day.</P>
<P>His mind relieved from inquietude re&s;pecting his &s;i&s;ter, and his &s;pirits rai&s;ed by the hope of &s;oon re&s;tor|ing her to freedom, he now had time to give a few moments to love and to Antonia. At the &s;ame hour as on his former vi&s;it, he repaired to Donna Elvira's. She had given orders for his admi&s;&s;ion. As &s;oon as he was announced, her daughter retired with Leo|nella; and when he entered the chamber, he found <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ady of the hou&s;e alone. She received him with
<PB N="245" REF="035729_0243_1006597A2D04B050">
le&s;s di&s;tance than before, and de&s;ired him to pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">|&s;elf near her upon the &s;ofa. She then, without lo&s;ing time, opened her bu&s;ine&s;s, as had been agreed between her&s;elf and Antonia.</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t not think me ungrateful, Don Lorenzo, or forgetful how e&s;&s;ential are the &s;ervices which you have rendered me with the marquis. I feel the weight of my obligations: nothing under the &s;un &s;hould in|duce my taking the &s;tep to which I am now compelled, but the intere&s;t of my child, of my beloved Antonia. My health is declining; God only knows how &s;oon I may be &s;ummoned before his throne. My daughter will be left without parents, and, &s;hould &s;he lo&s;e the protection of the Ci&s;ternas family, without friends. She is young and artle&s;s, unin&s;tructed in the world's perfidy, and with charms &s;ufficient to render her an ob|ject of &s;eduction. Judge then how I mu&s;t tremble at the pro&s;pect before her! Judge, how anxious I mu&s;t be to keep her from their &s;ociety who may excite the yet dormant pa&s;&s;ions of her bo&s;om. You are amiable, Don Lorenzo; Antonia has a &s;u&s;ceptible, a loving heart, and is grateful for the favours conferred upon us by your interference with the marquis. Your pre&s;ence makes me tremble: I fear le&s;t it &s;hould in|&s;pire her with &s;entiments which may embitter the re|mainder of her life, or encourage her to cheri&s;h hopes in her &s;ituation unju&s;tifiable and futile. Pardon me, when I avow my terrors, and let my frankne&s;s plead in my excu&s;e. I cannot forbid you my hou&s;e, for gratitude re&s;trains me; I can only throw my&s;elf upon your genero&s;ity, and entreat you to &s;pare the feelings of an anxious, of a doting mother. Believe me when I a&s;&s;ure you, that I lament the nece&s;&s;ity of rejecting your
<PB N="246" REF="035729_0244_100659AD847AF900">
acquaintance; but there is no remedy, and Antonia's intere&s;t obliges me to beg you to forbear your vi&s;its. By complying with my reque&s;t, you will increa&s;e the e&s;teem which I already feel for you, and of which every thing convinces me that you are truly de&s;erv|ing."</P>
<P>"Your frankne&s;s charms me," replied Lorenzo: "You &s;hall find, that in your favourable opinion of me you were not deceived; yet I hope that the rea&s;ons now in my power to alledge, will per&s;uade you to withdraw a reque&s;t which I cannot obey without in|finite reluctance. I love your daughter, love her mo&s;t &s;incerely; I wi&s;h for no greater happine&s;s than to in|&s;pire her with the &s;ame &s;entiments, and receive her hand at the altar as her hu&s;band. 'Tis true I am not rich my&s;elf, my father's death has left me but little in my own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; but my expectations ju&s;tify my pretending to the Cond&eacute; de las Ci&s;ternas' daughter."</P>
<P>He was proceeding, but Elvira interrupted him&mdash;</P>
<P>Ah! Don Lorenzo, you forget in that pompous title the meanne&s;s of my origin. You forget that I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ow pa&s;&s;ed fourteen years in Spain, di&s;avowed by my hu&s;band's family, and exi&s;ting upon a &s;tipend barely &s;ufficient for the &s;upport and education of my daughter. Nay, I have even been neglected by mo&s;t of my own relations, who out of envy affect to doubt the reality of my marriage. My allowance being di&s;|continued at my father-in-law's death, I was reduced to the very brink of want. In this &s;ituation I was found by my &s;i&s;ter, who, among&s;t all her foibles, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es a warm, generous, and affectionate heart. She aided me with the little fortune which my father left
<PB N="247" REF="035729_0245_10063CB14E76AAD0">
her, per&s;uaded me to vi&s;it Madrid, and has &s;upported my child and my&s;elf &s;ince our quitting Murcia. Then, con&s;ider not Antonia as de&s;cended from the Cond&eacute; de las Ci&s;ternas; con&s;ider her as a poor and unprotected orphan, as the grandchild of the trade&s;man Torribio Dalfa, as the needy pen&s;ioner of that trade&s;man's daughter. Reflect upon the difference between &s;uch a &s;ituation and that of the nephew and heir of the po|tent duke of Medina. I believe your intentions to be honourable; but as there are no hopes that your uncle will approve the union, I fore&s;ee that the con&s;equen|ces of your attachment mu&s;t be fatal to my child's re|po&s;e."</P>
<P>"Pardon me, Segnora; you are mi&s;informed if you &s;uppo&s;e the duke of Medina to re&s;emble the generality of men. His &s;entiments are liberal and di&s;intere&s;ted; he loves me well, and I have no rea&s;on to dread his forbidding the marriage, when he perceives that my happine&s;s depends upon Antonia. But &s;uppo&s;ing him to refu&s;e his &s;anction, what have I &s;till to fear? My parents are no more; my little fortune is in my own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; it will be &s;ufficient to &s;upport Antonia, and I &s;hall exchange for her hand Medina's dukedom without one &s;igh of regret."</P>
<P>"You are young and eager; it is natural for you to entertain &s;uch ideas. But experience has taught me to my co&s;t, that cur&s;es accompany an unequal alliance. I married the Cond&eacute; de las Ci&s;ternas in oppo&s;ition to the will of his relations; many an heart pang has puni&s;hed me for the imprudent &s;tep. Wherever we bent our cour&s;e, a father's execration pur&s;ued Gonzalvo. Poverty overtook us, and no

Accu&s;tomed to wealth and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;e, ill could my hu&s;band &s;upport the tran&s;ition to di&s;tre&s;s and indigence. He looked back with repining to the comforts which he once enjoyed. He regretted the &s;ituation which for my &s;ake he had quitted; and in moments when de&s;pair po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his mind, has reproached me with having made him the companion of want and wretch|edne&s;s. He has called me his bane! the &s;ource of his &s;orrows, the cau&s;e of his de&s;truction! Ah! God! he little knew how much keener were my own heart's reproaches! He was ignorant that I &s;uffered trebly, for my&s;elf, for my children, and for him! 'Tis true that his anger &s;eldom la&s;ted long: his &s;incere affec|tion for me &s;oon revived in his heart, and then his re|pentance for the tears which he had made me &s;hed, tortured me even more than his reproaches. He would throw him&s;elf on the ground, implore my for|givene&s;s in the mo&s;t frantic terms, and load him&s;elf with cur&s;es for being the murderer of my repo&s;e. Taught by experience, that an union contracted again&s;t the inclinations of families on either &s;ide mu&s;t be unfortunate, I will &s;ave my daughter from tho&s;e mi&s;eries which I have &s;uffered. Without your uncle's con&s;ent, while I live, &s;he never &s;hall be yours. Un|doubtedly he will di&s;approve of the union; his power is immen&s;e, and Antonia &s;hall not be expo&s;ed to his anger and per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>"His per&s;ecution? How ea&s;y may that be avoided! Let the wor&s;t happen, it is but quitting Spain. My wealth may ea&s;ily be reali&s;ed. The Indian i&s;lands will offer us a &s;ecure retreat. I have an e&s;tate, though

<P>"Ah! youth, this is a fond, romantic vi&s;ion. Gonzalvo thought the &s;ame. He fancied that he could leave Spain without regret; but the moment of parting undeceived him. You know not yet what it is to quit your native land: to quit it, never to behold it more! You know not what it is to exchange the &s;cenes where you have pa&s;&s;ed your infancy, for un|known realms and barbarous climates!&mdash;to be for|gotten, utterly, eternally forgotten by the companions of your youth!&mdash;to &s;ee your deare&s;t friends, the fond|e&s;t objects of your affection peri&s;hing with di&s;ea&s;es in|cidental to Indian atmo&s;pheres, and find your&s;elf una|ble to procure for them nece&s;&s;ary a&s;&s;i&s;tance! I have felt all this! My hu&s;band and two &s;weet babes found their graves in Cuba; nothing would have &s;aved my young Antonia, but my &s;udden return to Spain. Ah! Don Lorenzo, could you conceive what I &s;uffered during my ab&s;ence! Could you know how &s;orely I regretted all that I left behind, and how dear to me was the very name of Spain! I envied the winds which blew towards it: and when the Spani&s;h &s;ailor chanted &s;ome well known air as he pa&s;&s;ed my win|dow, tears filled my eyes, while I thought upon my native land. Gonzalvo too&mdash;my hu&s;band&mdash;"</P>

<P>"Excu&s;e my quitting you for a few moments; the remembrance of what I have &s;uffered has much agi|tated

me, and I need to be alone. Till I return, peru&s;e the&s;e lines. After my hu&s;band's death I found them among his papers. Had I know<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ooner that he entertained &s;uch &s;entiments, grief would have killed me. He wrote the&s;e ver&s;es on his voyage to Cuba, when his mind was clouded by &s;orrow, and he forgot that he had a wife and children. What we are lo&s;ing ever &s;eems to us the mo&s;t precious. Gonzalvo was quitting Spain for ever, and therefore was Spain dearer to his eyes than all el&s;e which the world contained. Read them, Don Lorenzo, they will give you &s;ome idea of the feelings of a bani&s;hed man."</P>
<P>Elvira put a paper into Lorenzo's hand, and retired from the chamber. The youth examined the contents, and found them to be as follows:</P>

<P>Lorenzo had &s;carcely time to read the&s;e lines, when Elvira returned to him: the giving a free cour&s;e to her tears had relieved her, and her &s;pirits had regained their u&s;ual compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>"I have nothing more to &s;ay, my lord," &s;aid &s;he; "you have heard my apprehen&s;ions, and my rea&s;ons for begging you not to repeat your vi&s;its. I have thrown my&s;elf in full confidence upon your honor. I am certain that you will not prove my opinion of you to be too favourable."</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="035729_0251_100659E6ECC9B2C0">
"But on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> que&s;tion more, Segnora, and I leave you. Should the duke of Medina approve my love, would my addre&s;&s;es be unacceptable to your&s;elf and the fair Antonia?"</P>
<P>"I will be open with you, Don Lorenzo: there being little probability of &s;uch an union taking place, I fear that it is de&s;ired but too ardently by my daughter. You have made an impre&s;&s;ion upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> young heart which gives me the mo&s;t &s;erious alarm: to prevent that impre&s;&s;ion from growing &s;tronger, I am obliged to decline your acquaintance. For me, you may be &s;ure that I &s;hould rejoice at e&s;tabli&s;hing my child &s;o advantageou&s;ly. Con&s;cious that my con|&s;titution, impaired by grief and illne&s;s, forbids me to expect a long continuance in this world, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the thought of leaving her under the protection of a perfect &s;tranger. The marquis de las Ci&s;ternas is to|tally unknown to me. He will marry: his lady may look upon Antonia with an eye of di&s;plea&s;ure, and de|prive her of her only friend. Should the duke, your uncle, give his con&s;ent, you need not doubt obtaining mine and my daughter's; but, without his, hope not for ours. At all events, whatever &s;teps you may take, whatever may be the duke's deci&s;ion, till you know it, let me beg your forbearing to &s;trengthen, by your pre&s;ence, Antonia's prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. If the &s;anction o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> your relations authorizes your addre&s;&s;ing her as your wife, my doors fly open to you. If that &s;anction is refu&s;ed, be &s;atisfied to po&s;&s;e&s;s my e&s;teem and gratitude, but remember that we mu&s;t meet no more."</P>
<P>Lorenzo promi&s;ed reluctantly to conform to this de|cree: but he added, that he hoped &s;oon to obtain that
<PB N="254" REF="035729_0252_100659B61C7F22B0">
con&s;ent which would give him a claim to the renewal of their acquaintance. He then explained to her why the marquis had not called in per&s;on; and made no &s;cruple of confiding to her his &s;i&s;ter's hi&s;tory. He con|cluded by &s;aying, "that he hoped to &s;et Agnes at lib|erty the next day; and that, as &s;oon as Don Ray|mond's fears were quieted upon this &s;ubject, he would lo&s;e no time in a&s;&s;uring Donna Elvira of his friend|&s;hip and protection.</P>
<P>The lady &s;hook her head.</P>
<P>"I tremble for your &s;i&s;ter," &s;aid &s;he; "I have heard many traits of the domina of St. Clare's char|acter from a friend who was educated in the &s;ame convent with her: &s;he reported her to be haughty, in|flexible, &s;uper&s;titious, and revengeful. I have &s;ince heard, that &s;he is infatuated with the idea of rendering her convent the mo&s;t regular in Madrid, and never for|gave tho&s;e who&s;e imprudence threw upon it the &s;light|e&s;t &s;tain. Though naturally violent and &s;evere, when her intere&s;ts require it, &s;he well knows how to a&s;&s;ume an appearance of benignity. She leaves no means un|tried to per&s;uade young women of rank to become members of her community: &s;he is implacable when once incen&s;ed, and has too much intrepidity to &s;hrink at taking the mo&s;t rigorous mea&s;ures for puni&s;hing the offender. Doubtle&s;s, &s;he will con&s;ider your &s;i&s;ter's quitting the convent as a di&s;grace thrown upon it: &s;he will u&s;e every artifice to avoid obeying the man|date of his holine&s;s; and I &s;hudder to think that Don|na Agnes is in the hands of this dangerous woman."</P>
<P>Lorenzo now ro&s;e to take leave. Elvira gave him her hand at parting, which he ki&s;&s;ed re&s;pectfully;
<PB N="255" REF="035729_0253_100659E872335D38">
and, telling her that he &s;oon hoped for the permi&s;&s;ion to &s;alute that of Antonia, he returned to his hotel. The lady was perfectly &s;atisfied with the conver&s;ation which had pa&s;&s;ed between them: &s;he looked forward with &s;atisfaction to the pro&s;pect of his becoming her &s;on-in-law; but prudence bade her conceal from her daughter's knowledge the flattering hopes which her|&s;elf now ventured to entertain.</P>
<P>Scarcely was it day, and already Lorenzo was at the convent of St. Clare, furni&s;hed with the nece&s;&s;ary man|date. The nuns were at matins. He waited impa|tiently for the conclu&s;ion of the &s;ervice; and at length the priore&s;s appeared at the parlour grate. Agnes was demanded. The old lady replied with a melan|choly air, that the dear child's &s;ituation grew hourly more dangerous: that the phy&s;icians de&s;paired of her life; but that they had declared the only chance for her recovery to con&s;i&s;t in keeping her quiet, and not to permit tho&s;e to approach her who&s;e pre&s;ence was likely to agitate her. Not a word of all this was be|lieved by Lorenzo, any more than he credited the ex|pre&s;&s;ions of grief and affection for Agnes with which this account was interlarded. To end the bu&s;ine&s;s, he put the pope's bull into the hands of the domina, and in&s;i&s;ted that, ill or in health, his &s;i&s;ter &s;hould be de|livered to him without delay.</P>
<P>The priore&s;s received the paper with an air of hu|mility; but no &s;ooner had her eye glanced over the contents than her re&s;entment baffled all the efforts of hypocri&s;y. A deep crim&s;on &s;pread it&s;elf over her face, and &s;he darted upon Lorenzo looks of rage and me|nace.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="035729_0254_100659B8D3754AF0">
"This order is po&s;itive," &s;aid &s;he, in a voice of an|ger, which &s;he in vain &s;trove to di&s;gui&s;e&punc; "willing|ly would I obey it, but unfortunately, it is out of my power."</P>
<P>Lorenzo interrupted her by an exclamation of &s;ur|pri&s;e.</P>
<P>"I repeat it, Segnor, to obey this order is totally out of my power. From tenderne&s;s to a brother's feelings, I would have communicated the &s;ad event to you by degrees, and have prepared you to hear it with fortitude. My mea&s;ures are broken through; this order commands me to deliver up to you the &s;i&s;ter Agnes without delay; I am, therefore, obliged to in|form you, without circumlocution, that on Friday la&s;t &s;he expired."</P>
<P>Lorenzo &s;tarted back with horror, and turned pale. A moment's recollection convinced him that this a&s;&s;er|tion mu&s;t be fal&s;e, and it re&s;tored him to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>"You deceive me!" &s;aid he, pa&s;&s;ionately: "but five minutes pa&s;t you a&s;&s;ured me that, though ill, &s;he was &s;till alive. Produce her this in&s;tant! See her I mu&s;t and will; and every attempt to keep her from me will be unavailing."</P>
<P>"You forget your&s;elf, Segnor: you owe re&s;pect to my age as well as my profe&s;&s;ion. Your &s;i&s;ter is no more. If I at fir&s;t concealed her death, it was from dreading le&s;t an event &s;o unexpected &s;hould produce on you too violent an effect. In truth, I am but ill re|paid for my attention. And what intere&s;t, I pray you, &s;hould I have in detaining her? To know her
<PB N="257" REF="035729_0255_100659EA27708EC0">
wi&s;h of quitting our &s;ociety is a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for me to wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words">, and think her a di&s;grace to the &s;i&s;terhood of St. Clare: but &s;he has forfeited my affection in a manner yet more culpable. Her crimes were great; and when you know the cau&s;e of her death, you will doubtle&s;s rejoice, Don Lorenzo, that &s;uch a wretch is no longer in exi&s;tence. She was tak|en ill on Thur&s;day la&s;t on returning from confe&s;&s;ion in the capuchin chapel: her malady &s;eemed attended with &s;trange circum&s;tances; but &s;he per&s;i&s;ted in con|cealing its cau&s;e. Thanks to the Virgin, we were too ignorant to &s;u&s;pect it! Judge then what mu&s;t have been our con&s;ternation, our horror, when &s;he was delivered the next day of a &s;till born child, whom &s;he immediately followed to the grave. How, Segnor? Is it po&s;&s;ible that your countenance expre&s;&s;es no &s;ur|pri&s;e, no indignation? Is it po&s;&s;ible that your &s;i&s;ter's infamy was known to you, and that &s;till &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed your affection? In that ca&s;e, you have no need of my compa&s;&s;ion. I can &s;ay nothing more; except re|peat my inability of obeying the orders of his holine&s;s. Agnes is no more; and, to convince you that what I &s;ay is true, I &s;wear by our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, that three days have pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince &s;he was buried."</P>
<P>Here &s;he ki&s;&s;ed a &s;mall crucifix which hung at her girdle: &s;he then ro&s;e from her chair, and quitted the parlour. As &s;he withdrew, &s;he ca&s;t upon Lorenzo a &s;cornful &s;mile.</P>
<P>"Farewell, Segnor," &s;aid &s;he; "I know no remedy for this accident. I fear that even a &s;econd bull from the pope will not procure your &s;i&s;ter's re&s;urrection."</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="035729_0256_100659BB78BCFE70">
Lorenzo al&s;o retired, penetrated with affliction&punc; but Don Raymond's, at the news of this event, amounted to madne&s;s: he would not be convinced that Agnes was really dead; and continued to in&s;i&s;t that the walls of St. Clare &s;till confined her. No argu|ments could make him abandon his hopes of regain|ing her. Every day &s;ome fre&s;h &s;cheme was invented for procuring intelligence of her, and all of them were attended with the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>On his part, Medina gave up the idea of ever &s;ee|ing his &s;i&s;ter more; yet he believed that &s;he had been taken off by unfair means. Under this per&s;ua&s;ion, he encouraged Don Raymond's re&s;earches, determin|ed, &s;hould he di&s;cover the lea&s;t warrant for his &s;u&s;pi|cions, to take a &s;evere vengeance upon the unfeeling priore&s;s. The lo&s;s of his &s;i&s;ter affected him &s;incerely: nor was it the lea&s;t cau&s;e of his di&s;tre&s;s, that propriety obliged him for &s;ome time to defer mentioning Anto|nia to the duke. In the mean while his emi&s;&s;aries con&s;tantly &s;urrounded Elvira's door. He had intelli|gence of all the movements of his mi&s;tre&s;s. As &s;he never failed every Thur&s;day to attend the &s;ermon in the Capuchin cathedral, he was &s;ecure of &s;eeing her once a week; though, in compliance with his prom|i&s;e, he carefully &s;hunned her ob&s;ervation. Thus two long months pa&s;&s;ed away. Still no information was procured of Agnes. All but the marquis credited her death: and now Lorenzo determined to di&s;clo&s;e his &s;entiments to his uncle: he had already dropped &s;ome hints of his intention to marry: they had been as fa|vourably received as he could expect; and he har|boured no doubt of the &s;ucce&s;s of his application.</P>

<P>WE now mu&s;t revi&s;it the mona&s;tery of the Cap|uchins. There we &s;hall find bo&s;oms agitated by very different emotions from tho&s;e which were felt by the innocent inhabitants of Elvira's dwelling.</P>
<P>With every &s;tep that Ambro&s;io made in the path of vice, he at fir&s;t looked back with regret to the &s;ta|tion which he had quitted: but, alas! with every &s;tep that regret became weaker. Matilda's eloquence and beauty, the power of habit, and the frailty of human nature, gradually dimini&s;hed the &s;en&s;ation, and at length it &s;carce could be &s;aid to be felt by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> bo&s;om at all. He no longer reflected with &s;hame upon his conduct, or dreaded the vengeance of Heav|en. One fear alone po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him. He trembled to lo&s;e Matilda, who &s;till laboured under the influence of poi&s;on. He therefore pre&s;&s;ed her with earne&s;tne&s;s to u&s;e the means of pre&s;ervation which &s;he had before declared to be in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>

No dangers &s;hall appal me: I will look upon the con&s;equences of my action boldly, nor &s;hudder at the horrors which they pre&s;ent: I will think my &s;ac|rifice &s;carcely worthy to purcha&s;e your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and remember, that a moment pa&s;&s;ed in your arms in this world o'erpays an age of puni&s;hment in the next. But before I take this &s;tep, Ambro&s;io, give me your &s;olemn oath never to enquire by what means I &s;hall pre&s;erve my&s;elf."</P>
<P>He did &s;o, in a manner the mo&s;t binding.</P>
<P>"I thank you, my beloved. This precaution is nece&s;&s;ary; for, though you know it not, you are under the command of vulgar prejudices. The bu&s;ine&s;s on which I mu&s;t be employed this night might &s;tartle you, from its &s;ingularity, and lower me in your opin|ion. Tell me, do you po&s;&s;e&s;s the key of the lower door on the we&s;tern &s;ide of the garden?"</P>
<P>"The door which opens into the burying-ground common to us and the &s;i&s;terhood of St. Clare? I have not the key, but can ea&s;ily procure it."</P>
<P>"You have only this to do. Admit me into the burying ground at night. Watch while I de&s;cend into the vaults of St. Clare, le&s;t &s;ome prying eye &s;hould ob&s;erve my actions. Leave me there alone for an hour, and that life is &s;afe which I dedicate to your plea&s;ures. To prevent creating &s;u&s;picion, do not vi&s;it me during the day. Remember the key, and that I expect you before twelve. Hark! I hear &s;teps ap|proaching! Leave me; I will pretend to &s;leep."</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="035729_0260_100659F1639E7C08">
The friar obeyed, and left the cell. As he opened the door, father Pablos made his appearance.</P>
<P>"I come," &s;aid the latter, "to enquire after the health of my young patient."</P>
<P>"Hu&s;h!" replied Ambro&s;io, laying his finger upon his lip; "&s;peak &s;oftly; I am ju&s;t come from him: he has fallen into a profound &s;lumber, which doubtle&s;s will be of &s;ervice to him. Do not di&s;turb him at pre&s;ent, for he wi&s;hes to repo&s;e."</P>
<P>Father Pablos obeyed, and hearing the bell ring, accompanied the abbot to matins. Ambro&s;io felt embarra&s;&s;ed as he entered the chapel. Guilt was new to him, and he fancied that every eye could read the tran&s;actions of the night upon his counte|nance. He &s;trove to pray: his bo&s;om no longer glowed with devotion: his thoughts in&s;en&s;ibly wan|dered to Matilda's charms. But what he wanted in purity of heart, he &s;upplied by exterior &s;anctity. The better to cloak his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, he redoubled his preten&s;ions to the &s;emblance of virtue, and never appeared more devoted to Heaven than &s;ince he had broken through his engagements. Thus did he un|con&s;ciou&s;ly add hypocri&s;y to perjury and weakne&s;s; he had fallen into the latter errors from yielding to &s;eduction almo&s;t, irre&s;i&s;tible; but he was now guilty of a voluntary fault, by endeavouring to conceal tho&s;e into which another had betrayed him.</P>
<P>The matins concluded, Ambro&s;io retired to his cell&punc; His brain was &s;till bewildered, and pre&s;ented a con|fu&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">aos of remor&s;e, inquietude and fear: he look|ed back with regret to that peace of &s;oul, that &s;ecurity
<PB N="6" REF="035729_0261_100659BEDF6C1CF8">
of virtue, which till then had been his portion: he had committed an error, from who&s;e very idea but a few hours before he would have recoiled with horror: he &s;huddered at reflecting that a trifling indi&s;cretion on his part, or on Matilda's, would overturn that fab|ric of reputation which it had co&s;t him thirty years to erect, and render him the abhorrence of that people of whom he was then the idol. Con&s;cience painted to him in glaring colours his perjury and weakne&s;s; apprehen&s;ion magnified to him the horrors of puni&s;h|ment, and he already fancied him&s;elf in the pri&s;ons of the Inqui&s;ition. To the&s;e tormenting ideas &s;ucceeded Matilda's charms and tenderne&s;s. A &s;ingle glance thrown upon the&s;e, reconciled him with him&s;elf; and he con&s;idered her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to have been purcha&s;ed at an ea&s;y price, by the &s;acrifice of innocence and hon|our. Their very remembrance filled his &s;oul with ec&s;tacy: he cur&s;ed his fooli&s;h vanity, which had in|duced him to wa&s;te in ob&s;curity the bloom of life, ig|norant of the ble&s;&s;ings of love and woman: he deter|mined, at all events, to continue his commerce with Matilda, and called every argument to his aid which might confirm his re&s;olution: he a&s;ked him&s;elf, provided his irregularity was unknown, in what would his fault con&s;i&s;t, and what con&s;equences he had to apprehend? By adhering &s;trictly to every rule of his order &s;ave cha&s;tity, he doubted not to retain the e&s;teem of men, and even the protection of Heaven: he tru&s;ted ea&s;ily to be forgiven &s;o &s;light and natural a deviation from his vows; but he forgot that, having pronounced tho&s;e vows, that which is in laymen the mo&s;t venial of errors, became in his per&s;on the mo&s;t heinous of crimes.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="035729_0262_100659F2ED4C4870">
Once decided upon his future conduct, his mind became more ea&s;y. Obedient to Matilda's order, he vi&s;ited not her cell during the day. Father Pablos mentioned in the refectory, that Ro&s;ario had at length been prevailed upon to follow his pre&s;cription; but that the medicine had not produced the &s;lighte&s;t effect, and that he believed no mortal &s;kill could re&s;cue him from the grave. With this opinion the abbot agreed, and affected to lament the untimely fate of a youth who&s;e talents had appeared &s;o promi&s;ing.</P>
<P>The night arrived. Ambro&s;io had taken care to procure from the porter the key of the low door opening into the cemetery. Furni&s;hed with this, when all was &s;ilent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the mona&s;tery, he quitted his cell, and ha&s;tened to Matilda's. She had left her bed, and was dre&s;&s;ed before his arrival.</P>
<P>"I have been expecting you with impatience," &s;aid &s;he; "my life depends upon the&s;e moments. Have you the key?"</P>
<P>"I have."</P>
<P>"Away then to the garden! We have no time to lo&s;e. Follow me!"</P>
<P>She took a &s;mall covered ba&s;ket from the table. Bearing this in one hand, and the lamp, which was flaming upon the hearth, in the other, &s;he ha&s;tened from the cell. Ambro&s;io followed her. Both main|tained a profound &s;ilence. She moved on with quick but cautious &s;teps, pa&s;&s;ed through the cloi&s;ters, and reached the we&s;tern &s;ide of the garden: her eyes fla&s;h|ed with a fire and wildne&s;s which impre&s;&s;ed the monk at once with awe and horror. A determined de&s;perate
<PB N="8" REF="035729_0263_100659C1B76916D0">
courage reigned upon her brow: &s;he gave the lamp to Ambro&s;io; then taking from him the key, &s;he un|locked the low door, and entered the cemetery. It was a va&s;t and &s;pacious &s;quare, planted with yew-trees; half of it belonged to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> abbey, the other half was the property of the &s;i&s;terhood of St. Clare, and was pro|tected by a roof of &s;tone; the divi&s;ion was marked by an iron railing, the wicket of which was generally left unlocked.</P>
<P>Thither Matilda bent her cour&s;e; &s;he opened the wicket, and &s;ought for the door leading to the &s;ub|terraneous vaults, where repo&s;ed the mouldering bodies of the votaries of St. Clare. The night was perfectly dark, neither moon nor &s;tars were vi&s;ible. Luckily there was not a breath of wind, and the friar bore his lamp in full &s;ecurity; by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of its beams the door of the &s;epulchre was &s;oon di&s;covered. It was &s;unk within the hollow of a wall, and almo&s;t concealed by thick fe&s;toons of ivy hanging over it. Three &s;teps of rough hewn &s;tone conducted to it, and Matilda was on the point of de&s;cending them, when &s;he &s;uddenly &s;tarted back.</P>
<P>"There are people in the vaults!" &s;he whi&s;pered to the monk; "conceal your&s;elf till they are pa&s;&s;ed."</P>
<P>She took refuge behind a lofty and magnificent tomb, erected in honour of the convent's foundre&s;s. Ambro&s;io followed her example, carefully hiding his lamp, le&s;t its beams &s;hould betray them. But a few moments had elap&s;ed, when the door was pu&s;hed open leading to the &s;ubterraneous caverns. Rays of light proceeded up the &s;tair-ca&s;e: they enabled the concealed &s;pectators to ob&s;erve two females dre&s;&s;ed in
<PB N="9" REF="035729_0264_100659F6D17AC6F8">
religious habits, who &s;eemed engaged in earne&s;t con|ver&s;ation. The abbot had no difficulty to recognize the priore&s;s of St. Clare in the fir&s;t, and one of the elder nuns in her companion.</P>
<P>"Every thing is prepared," &s;aid the priore&s;s, "her fate &s;hall be decided to-morrow; all her tears and &s;ighs will be unavailing. No! in five and twenty years that I have been &s;uperior of this convent, never did I witne&s;s a tran&s;action more infamous!"</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t expect much oppo&s;ition to your will;" the other replied in a milder voice; "Agnes has many friends in the convent, and in particular the mother St. Ur&s;ula will e&s;pou&s;e her cau&s;e mo&s;t warmly. In truth, &s;he merits to have friends; and I wi&s;h I could prevail upon you to con&s;ider her youth and her peculiar &s;ituation. She &s;eems &s;en&s;ible of her fault; the exce&s;s of her grief proves her penitence, and I am convinced that her tears flow more from contrition, than fear of puni&s;hment. Reverend mother, would you be per&s;uaded to mitigate the &s;everity of your &s;entence; would you but deign to overlook this fir&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, I offer my&s;elf as the pledge of her future conduct."</P>
<P>"Overlook it, &s;ay you? Mother Camilla you amaze me! What, after di&s;gracing me in the pre&s;ence of Madrid's idol, of the very man on whom I mo&s;t wi&s;hed to impre&s;s an idea of the &s;trictne&s;s of my di&s;cipline! How de&s;picable mu&s;t I have appeared to the reverend abbot! No, mother&mdash;no, I never can forgive the in&s;ult. I cannot better convince Ambro&s;io that I abhor &s;uch crimes, than by puni&s;hing that of Agnes with all the rigour of which our &s;evere laws
<PB N="10" REF="035729_0265_100659C462555650">
admit. Cea&s;e then your &s;upplications, they will all be unavailing. My re&s;olution is taken. To-morrow Agnes &s;hall be made a terrible example of my ju&s;tice and re&s;entment."</P>
<P>The mother Camilla &s;eemed not to give up the point, but by this time the nuns were out of hearing. The priore&s;s unlocked the door which communicated with St. Clare's chapel, and, having entered with her companion, clo&s;ed it again after them.</P>
<P>Matilda now a&s;ked, who was this Agnes with whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> priore&s;s was thus incen&s;ed, and what con|nection <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> could have with Ambro&s;io. He related her adventure: and he added that, &s;ince that time his ideas having undergone a thorough revolution, he n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">w felt much compa&s;&s;ion for the unfortunate nun.</P>
<P>"I de&s;ign," &s;aid he, "to reque&s;t an audience of the domina to-morrow, and u&s;e every means to obtain a mitigation of her &s;entence."</P>
<P>"Beware of what you do," interrupted Matilda; "your &s;udden change of &s;entiment may naturally cre|ate &s;urpri&s;e, and may give birth to &s;u&s;picions which it is mo&s;t our intere&s;t to avoid. Rather redouble your outward au&s;terity, and thunder out menaces again&s;t the errors of others, the better to conceal your own. Abandon the nun to her fate. Your interfering might be dangerous, and her imprudence merits to be pun|i&s;hed: &s;he is unworthy to enjoy love's plea&s;ures, who has not wit enough to conceal them. But in di&s;cu&s;|&s;ing this trifling &s;ubject, I wa&s;te moments which are precious. The night flies apace, and much mu&s;t be done before morning. The nuns are retired; all is &s;afe.
<PB N="11" REF="035729_0266_100659F85933A900">
Give me the lamp, Ambro&s;io, I mu&s;t de&s;cend alone into the&s;e caverns: wait here, and if any one approaches, warn me by your voice; but as you value your exi&s;t|ence, pre&s;ume not to follow me: your life would fall a victim to your imprudent curio&s;ity."</P>
<P>Thus &s;aying, &s;he advanced towards the &s;epulchre, &s;till holding her lamp in one hand, and her little ba&s;ket in the other. She touched the door: it turned &s;lowly upon its grating hinges, and a narrow winding &s;tair|ca&s;e of black marble pre&s;ented it&s;elf to her eyes. She de&s;cended it; Ambro&s;io remained above, watching the faint beams of the lamp, as they &s;till receded down the &s;tairs. They di&s;appeared, and he found him&s;elf in total darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>Left to him&s;elf, he could not reflect without &s;ur|pri&s;e on the &s;udden change in Matilda's character and &s;entiments. But a few days had pa&s;&s;ed, &s;ince &s;he ap|peared the milde&s;t and &s;ofte&s;t of her &s;ex, devoted to his will, and looking up to him as to a &s;uperior being. Now &s;he a&s;&s;umed a &s;ort of courage and manline&s;s in her manners and di&s;cour&s;e, but ill calculated to plea&s;e him. She &s;poke no longer to in&s;inuate, but com|mand: he found him&s;elf unable to cope with her in argument, and was unwillingly obliged to confe&s;s the &s;uperiority of her judgment. Every moment convinc|ed him of the a&s;toni&s;hing powers of her mind: but what &s;he gained in the opinion of the man, &s;he lo&s;t with intere&s;t in the affection of the lover. He regret|ted Ro&s;ario, the fond, the gentle, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive; he grieved that Matilda preferred the virtues of his &s;ex to tho&s;e of her own; and when he thought of her expre&s;|&s;ions re&s;pecting the devoted nun, he could not help blaming them as cruel and unfeminine. Pity is a &s;en|timent

<PB N="12" REF="035729_0267_100659C5EAFC7888">
&s;o natural, &s;o appropriate to the female char|acter, that it is &s;carcely a merit for a woman to po&s;&s;e&s;s it; but to be without it is a grievous crime. Ambro&s;io could not ea&s;ily forgive his mi&s;tre&s;s for being deficient in this amiable quality. However, though he blamed her in&s;en&s;ibility, he felt the truth of her ob&s;ervations; and though he pitied &s;incerely the unfortunate Agnes, he re&s;olved to drop the idea of interpo&s;ing in her be|half.</P>
<P>Near an hour had elap&s;ed &s;ince Matilda de&s;cended into the caverns; &s;till &s;he returned not. Ambro&s;io's curio&s;ity was excited. He drew near the &s;tair-ca&s;e&mdash;he li&s;tened&mdash;all was &s;ilent, except that at intervals he caught the &s;ound of Matilda's voice, as it wound along the &s;ub|terraneous pa&s;&s;ages, and was re-echoed by the &s;epul|chre's vaulted roofs. She was at too great a di&s;tance for him to di&s;tingui&s;h her words, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">re they reached him, they were deadened in a low murmur. He long|ed to penetrate into this my&s;tery. He re&s;olved to di&s;|obey her injunctions, and follow her into the cavern. He advanced to the &s;tair-ca&s;e; he had already de&s;cend|ed &s;ome &s;teps, when his courage failed him. He re|membered Matilda's menaces if he infringed her or|ders, and his bo&s;om was filled with a &s;ecret unaccount|able awe. He returned up the &s;tairs, re&s;umed his former &s;tation, and waited impatiently for the con|clu&s;ion of this adventure.</P>
<P>Suddenly he was &s;en&s;ible of a violent &s;hock. An earthquake rocked the ground, the columns which &s;up|ported the roof under which he &s;tood, were &s;o &s;trongly &s;haken, that every moment menaced him with its fall, and at the &s;ame moment he heard a loud and tremen|dous bur&s;t of thunder: it cea&s;ed; and his eyes being
<PB N="13" REF="035729_0268_100659F9E0EDF268">
fixed upon the &s;tair-ca&s;e, he &s;aw a bright column of light fla&s;h along the caverns beneath. It was &s;een but for an in&s;tant. No &s;ooner did it di&s;appear, than all was once more quiet and ob&s;cure. Profound darkne&s;s again &s;urrounded him, and the &s;ilence of night was only broken by the whirring bat as &s;he flitted &s;lowly by him.</P>
<P>With every in&s;tant Ambro&s;io's amazement increa&s;|ed. Another hour elap&s;ed, after which the &s;ame light again appeared, and was lo&s;t again as &s;uddenly. It was accompanied by a &s;train of &s;weet but &s;olemn mu&s;ic, which, as it &s;tole through the vaults below, in&s;pired the monk with mingled delight and terror. It had not long been hu&s;hed, when he heard Matilda's &s;teps upon the &s;tair-ca&s;e. She a&s;cended from the cavern; the mo&s;t lively joy animated her beautiful features.</P>
<P>"Did you &s;ee any thing?" &s;he a&s;ked.</P>
<P>"Twice I &s;aw a column of light fla&s;h up the &s;tair|ca&s;e."</P>
<P>"Nothing el&s;e?"</P>
<P>"Nothing."</P>
<P>"The morning is on the point of breaking: let us retire to the abbey, le&s;t day-light &s;hould betray us."</P>
<P>With a light &s;tep &s;he ha&s;tened from the burying|ground. She regained her cell, and the curious abbot &s;till accompanied her. She clo&s;ed the door, and di&s;|embacra&s;&s;ed her&s;elf of her lamp and ba&s;ket.</P>
<P>"I have &s;ucceeded!" &s;he cried, throwing her&s;elf up|on his bo&s;om; "&s;ucceeded beyond my fonde&s;t hopes! I &s;hall live, Ambro&s;io; &s;hall live for you! The &s;tep,
<PB N="14" REF="035729_0269_100659C7DDA05DA8">
which I &s;huddered at taking, proves to me a &s;ource of joys inexpre&s;&s;ible! Oh! that I dared communicate tho&s;e joys to you! Oh! that I were permitted to &s;hare with you my power, and rai&s;e you as high above the level of your &s;ex, as one bold deed has exalted me above mine!"</P>
<P>"And what prevents you, Matilda?" interrupted the friar. "Why is your bu&s;ine&s;s in the cavern made a &s;e|cret? Do you think me unde&s;erving of your confidence? Matilda, I mu&s;t doubt the truth of your affection, while you have joys in which I am forbidden to &s;hare."</P>
<P>"You reproach me with inju&s;tice; I grieve &s;incere|ly that I am obliged to conceal from you my happi|ne&s;s: but I am not to blame; the fault lies not in me, but in your&s;elf, my Ambro&s;io. You are &s;till too much the monk; your mind is en&s;laved by the prejudices of education: and &s;uper&s;tition might make you &s;hudder at the idea of that which experience has taught me to prize and value. At pre&s;ent you are unfit to be tru&s;t|ed with a &s;ecret of &s;uch importance; but the &s;trength of your judgment, and the curio&s;ity which I rejoice to &s;ee &s;parkling in your eyes, make me hope that you will one day de&s;erve my confidence. Till that period arrives, re&s;train your impatience. Remember that you have given me your &s;olemn oath never to enquire into this night's adventures. I in&s;i&s;t upon your keep|ing this oath; for, though," &s;he added, &s;miling, while &s;he &s;ealed his lips with a ki&s;s, "though I forgive your breaking your vows to Heaven, I expect you to keep your vows to me."</P>
<P>This the friar he&s;itated not to promi&s;e, or Matilda to believe. The monks rejoiced in the feigned Ro|&s;ario's

unexpected recovery, and none of them &s;u&s;pect|ed his real &s;ex. The abbot po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his mi&s;tre&s;s in tranquillity, and, perceiving his frailty un&s;u&s;pected, abandoned him&s;elf to his pa&s;&s;ions in full &s;ecurity. Shame and remor&s;e no longer tormented him. Fre|quent repetitions made him familiar with &s;in, and his bo&s;om became proof again&s;t the &s;tings of con&s;cience. In the&s;e &s;entiments he was encouraged by Matilda; but &s;he &s;oon was aware that &s;he had &s;atiated her lover by the unbounded freedom of her care&s;&s;es. Her charms becoming accu&s;tomed to him, they cea&s;ed to excite the &s;ame emotions which at fir&s;t they had in|&s;pired. The delirium of pa&s;&s;ion being pa&s;t, he had lei&s;ure to ob&s;erve every trifling defect; where none were to be found, &s;atiety made him fancy them. A week had &s;carcely elap&s;ed before he was wearied of his conque&s;t; and his humour, naturally incon&s;tant, made him &s;igh impatiently for variety.</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which cloys man, only increa&s;es the af|fection of women. Matilda with every &s;ucceeding day grew more attached to the friar. Since &s;he was become his, he was dearer to her than ever; but un|fortunately, as her pa&s;&s;ion grew ardent, Ambro&s;io's grew cold; the very marks of her fondne&s;s excited his di&s;gu&s;t, and its exce&s;s &s;erved to extingui&s;h the flame which already burned but feebly in his bo&s;om. Matilda could not but remark that her &s;ociety &s;eemed to him daily le&s;s agreeable; he was inattentive while &s;he &s;poke; her mu&s;ical talents, which &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in perfection, had lo&s;t the power of amu&s;ing him; or, if he deigned to prai&s;e them, his compliments were evi|dently forced and cold. He no longer gazed upon her with affection, or applauded her &s;entiments with
<PB N="16" REF="035729_0271_100659CBCEADB890">
a lover's partiality. This Matilda well perceived, and redoubled her efforts to revive tho&s;e &s;entiments which he once had felt. She could not but fail, &s;ince he con&s;idered as importunities the pains which &s;he took to plea&s;e him, and was di&s;gu&s;ted by the very means which &s;he u&s;ed to recall the wanderer. In &s;pite of her beauty, he gazed upon every other female with more de&s;ire; but fearing that his hypocri&s;y &s;hould be made public, he confined his inclinations to his own brea&s;t.</P>
<P>It was by no means his nature to be timid: but his education had impre&s;&s;ed his mind with fear &s;o &s;trong|ly, that apprehen&s;ion was now become part of his character. Had his youth been pa&s;&s;ed in the world, he would have &s;hewn him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of many bril|liant and manly qualities. He was naturally enterpri|&s;ing, firm, and fearle&s;s: he had a warrior's heart, and he might have &s;hone with &s;plendour at the head of an army. There was no want of genero&s;ity in his na|ture: the wretched never failed to find in him a com|pa&s;&s;ionate auditor. His abilities were quick and &s;hi|ning, and his judgment va&s;t, &s;olid and deci&s;ive. With &s;uch qualifications, he would have been an or|nament to his country: that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them he had given proofs in his earlie&s;t infancy, and his parents had beheld his dawning virtues with the fonde&s;t de|light and admiration. Unfortunately, while yet a child, he was deprived of tho&s;e parents. He fell into the power of a relation, who&s;e only wi&s;h about him was never to hear of him more: for that purpo&s;e he gave him in charge to his friend, the former &s;uperior of the Capuchins. The abbot, a very monk, u&s;ed all his endeavours to per&s;uade the boy that happine&s;s ex|i&s;ted

not without the walls of a convent. He &s;uc|ceeded fully. To de&s;erve admittance into the order of St. Francis was Ambro&s;io's highe&s;t ambition. His in&s;tructors carefully repre&s;&s;ed tho&s;e virtues, who&s;e grandeur and di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s were ill &s;uited to the cloi&s;ter. In&s;tead of univer&s;al benevolence, he adopted a &s;elfi&s;h partiality for his own particular e&s;tabli&s;hment: he was taught to con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">er compa&s;&s;ion for the errors of others as a crime <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the blacke&s;t dye: the noble frankne&s;s of his temper was exchanged for &s;ervile hu|mility; and in order to break his natural &s;pirit, the monks terrified his young mind, by placing before him all the horrors with which &s;uper&s;tition could fur|ni&s;h them: they painted to him the torments of the damned in colours the mo&s;t dark, terrible and fanta&s;tic, and threatened him at the &s;lighte&s;t fault with eternal perdition. No wonder that his imagination con&s;tantly dwelling upon the&s;e fearful objects &s;hould have render|ed his character timid and apprehen&s;ive. Add to this, that his long ab&s;ence from the great world, and total unacquaintance with the common dangers of life, made him form of them an idea far more di&s;mal than the reality. While the monks were bu&s;ied in rooting out his virtues, and narrowing his &s;entiments, they allowed every vice which had fallen to his &s;hare to arrive at full perfection. He was &s;uffered to be proud, vain, ambi|tious and di&s;dainful: he was jealous of his equals, and de&s;pi&s;ed all merit but his own: he was implacable when offended, and cruel in his revenge. Still, in &s;pite of the pains taken to pervert them, his natural good qual|ities would occa&s;ionally break through the gloom ca&s;t over them &s;o carefully. At &s;uch times, the conte&s;t for &s;uperiority between his real and acquired character was &s;triking and unaccountable to tho&s;e unacquainted
<PB N="18" REF="035729_0273_100659CD5574C858">
with his original di&s;po&s;ition. He pronounced the mo&s;t &s;evere &s;entences upon offenders, which the moment af|ter compa&s;&s;ion induced him to mitigate: he undertook the mo&s;t daring enterpri&s;es, which the fear of their con&s;equences &s;oon obliged him to abandon: his inborn genius darted a brilliant light upon &s;ubjects the mo&s;t ob&s;cure, and almo&s;t in&s;tantaneou&s;ly his &s;uper&s;tition replunged them in darkne&s;s more profound than that from which they had ju&s;t been re&s;cued. His brother monks regarding him as a &s;uperior being, remarked not this contradiction in their idol's conduct. They were per&s;uaded that what he did mu&s;t be right, and &s;uppo&s;ed him to have good rea&s;ons for changing his re&s;olutions. The fact was, that the different &s;enti|ments, with which education and nature had in&s;pired him, were combating in his bo&s;om: it remained for his pa&s;&s;ions, which as yet no opportunity had called into play, to decide the victory. Unfortunately his pa&s;&s;ions were the very wor&s;t judges to whom he could po&s;&s;ibly have applied. His mona&s;tic &s;eclu&s;ion had till now been in his favour, &s;ince it gave him no room for di&s;covering his bad qualities. The &s;uperior|ity of his talents rai&s;ed him too far above his compan|ions to permit his being jealous of them: his exem|plary piety, per&s;ua&s;ive eloquence, and plea&s;ing man|ners had &s;ecured him univer&s;al e&s;teem, and con&s;equent|ly he had no injuries to revenge: his ambition was ju&s;tified by his acknowledged merit, and his pride con|&s;idered as no more than proper confidence. He nev|er &s;aw, much le&s;s conver&s;ed with, the other &s;ex; and if he read in the cour&s;e of his &s;tudies

of his con&s;titution: but no &s;ooner did opportunity pre&s;ent it&s;elf, no &s;ooner did he catch a glimp&s;e of joys to which he was &s;till a &s;tranger, than religion's bar|riers were too feeble to re&s;i&s;t the overwhelming torrent of his de&s;ires. All impediments yielded before the force of his temperament, warm, &s;anguine and volup|tuous in the exce&s;s. As yet his other pa&s;&s;ions lay dormant; but they only needed to be once awaken|ed, to di&s;play them&s;elves with violence as great and irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>
<P>He continued to be the admiration of Madrid. The enthu&s;ia&s;m created by his eloquence &s;eemed rather to increa&s;e than dimini&s;h. Every Thur&s;day, which was the only day when he appeared in public, the Capuchin cathedral was crowded with auditors, and his di&s;cour&s;e was always received with the &s;ame ap|probation. He was named confe&s;&s;or to all the chief families in Madrid; and no one was counted fa&s;hion|able who was enjoined penance by any other than Ambro&s;io. In his re&s;olution of never &s;tirring out of his convent he &s;till per&s;i&s;ted. This circum&s;tance cre|ated a &s;till greater opinion of his &s;anctity and &s;elf-de|nial. Above all, the women &s;ang forth his prai&s;es loudly, le&s;s influenced by devotion than by his noble countenance, maje&s;tic air, and well-turned graceful fig|ure. The abbey door was thronged with carriages from morning to night; and the noble&s;t and faire&s;t dames of Madrid confe&s;&s;ed to the abbot their &s;ecret peccadilloes. The friar's eyes devoured their charms. Had his penitents con&s;ulted the&s;e interpreters, he would have needed no other means of expre&s;&s;ing his de&s;ires. The climate's heat, 'tis well known, operates with no &s;mall influence upon the con&s;titutions of the
<PB N="20" REF="035729_0275_100659CEDB4815C8">
Spani&s;h ladies: but the mo&s;t abandoned would have thought it an ea&s;ier ta&s;k to in&s;pire with pa&s;&s;ion the marble &s;tatue of St. Francis than the cold and rigid heart of the immaculate Ambro&s;io.</P>
<P>On his part, the friar was little acquainted with the depravity of the world: he &s;u&s;pected not that but few of his penitents would have rejected his addre&s;&s;es. Yet, had he been better in&s;tructed on this head, the danger attending &s;uch an attempt would have &s;ealed up his lips in &s;ilence. He knew that it would be diffi|cult for a woman to keep a &s;ecret &s;o &s;trange and &s;o important as his frailty; and he even trembled, le&s;t Matilda &s;hould betray him. Anxious to pre&s;erve a reputation which was infinitely dear to him, he &s;aw all the ri&s;k of committing it to the power of &s;ome vain giddy female; and as the beauties of Madrid affected only his &s;en&s;es without touching his heart, he forgot them as &s;oon as they were out of his &s;ight. The dan|ger of di&s;covery, the fear of being repul&s;ed, the lo&s;s of reputation; all the&s;e con&s;iderations coun&s;elled him to &s;tifle his de&s;ires; and though he now felt for her the mo&s;t perfect indifference, he was nece&s;&s;itated to con|fine his addre&s;&s;es to Matilda.</P>
<P>One morning, the confluence of penitents was greater than u&s;ual. He was detained in the confe&s;|&s;ional chair till a late hour. At length the crowd was di&s;patched, and he prepared to quit the chapel, when two females entered, and drew near him with humili|ty. They threw up their veils, and the younge&s;t en|treated him to li&s;ten to her for a few moments. The melody of her voice, of that voice to which no man ever li&s;tened without intere&s;t, immediately caught Ambro&s;io's attention. He &s;topped. The petitioner
<PB N="21" REF="035729_0276_10065A02F70C54B8">
&s;eemed bowed down with affliction: her cheeks were pale, her eyes dimmed with tears, and her hair fell in di&s;order over her face and bo&s;om. Still her counte|nance was &s;o &s;weet, &s;o innocent, &s;o heavenly, as might have charmed an heart le&s;s &s;u&s;ceptible than that which panted in the abbot's brea&s;t. With more than u&s;ual &s;oftne&s;s of manner he de&s;ired her to proceed, and heard her &s;peak as follows, with an emotion which increa&s;ed every moment:</P>
<P>"Reverend father, you &s;ee an unfortunate threaten|ed with the lo&s;s of her deare&s;t, of almo&s;t her only friend! My mother, my excellent mother lies upon the bed of &s;ickne&s;s. A &s;udden and dreadful malady &s;eized her la&s;t night, and &s;o rapid has been its prog|re&s;s that the phy&s;icians de&s;pair of her life. Human aid fails me; nothing remains for me but to implore the mercy of Heaven. Father, all Madrid rings with the report of your piety and virtue. Deign to re|member my mother in your prayers: perhaps they may prevail on the Almighty to &s;pare her; and &s;hould that be the ca&s;e, I engage my&s;elf every Thur&s;|day in the next three months to illuminate the &s;hrine of St. Francis in his honour."</P>
<P>"So!" thought the monk; "here we have a &s;ec|ond Vincentio della Ronda. Ro&s;ario's adventure be|gan thus; and he wi&s;hed &s;ecretly that this might have the &s;ame conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>He acceded to the reque&s;t. The petitioner return|ed him thanks with every mark of gratitude, and then continued:</P>
<P>"I have yet another favour to a&s;k. We are &s;tran|gers in Madrid: my mother needs a confe&s;&s;or, and
<PB N="22" REF="035729_0277_100659D089BD4D28">
knows not to whom &s;he &s;hould apply. We under&s;tand that you never quit the abbey; and, alas! my poor mother is unable to come hither! If you would have the goodne&s;s, reverend father, to name a proper per|&s;on, who&s;e wi&s;e and pious con&s;olations may &s;often the agonies of my parent's death-bed, you will confer an everla&s;ting favour upon hearts not ungrateful."</P>
<P>With this petition al&s;o the monk complied. In|deed, what petition would he have refu&s;ed, if urged in &s;uch enchanting accents? The &s;uppliant was &s;o inte|re&s;ting! Her voice was &s;o &s;weet, &s;o harmonious! Her very tears became her, and her affliction &s;eemed to add new lu&s;tre to her charms. He promi&s;ed to &s;end to her a confe&s;&s;or that &s;ame evening, and begged her to leave her addre&s;s. The companion pre&s;ented him with a card on which it was written, and then with|drew with the fair petitioner, who pronounced before her departure a thou&s;and benedictions on the abbot's goodne&s;s. His eyes followed her out of the chapel. It was not till &s;he was out of &s;ight that he examined the card, on which he read the following words:</P>
<P>"Donna Elvira Dalfa, &s;trada di San Iago, four doors from the palace d'Albornos."</P>
<P>The &s;uppliant was no other than Antonia, and Leo|nella was her companion. The latter had not con&s;ent|ed without difficulty to accompany her niece to the ab|bey. Ambro&s;io had in&s;pired her with &s;uch awe, that &s;he trembled at the very &s;ight of him. Her fears had con|quered even her natural loquacity; and while in his pre&s;ence &s;he uttered not a &s;ingle &s;yllable.</P>
<P>The monk retired to his cell, whither he was pur&s;u|ed by Antonia's image. He felt a thou&s;and new emo|tions
<PB N="23" REF="035729_0278_10065A04DEC4BD50">
&s;pringing in his bo&s;om, and he trembled to exam|ine into the cau&s;e which gave them birth. They were totally different from tho&s;e in&s;pired by Matilda, when &s;he fir&s;t declared her &s;ex and her affection. No voluptuous de&s;ires rioted in his bo&s;om. On the con|trary, what he now felt was a mingled &s;entiment of tenderne&s;s, admiration, and re&s;pect. A &s;oft and deli|cious melancholy infu&s;ed it&s;elf into his &s;oul, and he would not have exchanged it for the mo&s;t lively tran&s;|ports of joy. Society now di&s;gu&s;ted him: he delight|ed in &s;olitude, which permitted his indulging the vi&s;|ions of fancy: his thoughts were all gentle, &s;ad and &s;oothing; and the whole wide world pre&s;ented him with no other object than Antonia.</P>
<P>"Happy man!" he exclaimed in his romantic en|thu&s;ia&s;m&mdash;"happy man, who is de&s;tined to po&s;&s;e&s;s the heart of that lovely girl! What delicacy in her fea|tures! What elegance in her form! How enchant|ing was the timid innocence of her eyes! and how different from the wanton expre&s;&s;ion, the wild luxuri|ous fire, which &s;parkles in Matilda's! Oh, &s;weeter mu&s;t one ki&s;s be, &s;natched from the ro&s;y lips of the one, than all the full and glutting favours be&s;towed &s;o freely by the other. Matilda forces me to her arms, apes the harlot, and glories in what &s;hould be her &s;hame! Did &s;he know the inexpre&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ible charm of mod|e&s;ty, how irre&s;i&s;tibly it enthrals the heart of man, how firmly it chains him to the throne of beauty, &s;he never would have thrown it off. What would be too dear a price for this lovely girl's affections? What would I not &s;acrifice, could I be relea&s;ed from my vows, and permitted to declare my love in the &s;ight of earth and heaven? While I &s;trove in&s;pire her with

tenderne&s;s, with friend&s;hip and e&s;teem, how tranquil and undi&s;turbed would the hours roll away! Gracious God! to &s;ee her blue downca&s;t eyes beam upon mine with timid fondne&s;s! to &s;it for days, for years, li&s;ten|ing to that gentle voice! to acquire the right of oblig|ing her, and hear the artle&s;s expre&s;&s;ions of her grati|tude! to watch the emotions of her &s;potle&s;s heart! to encourage each dawning virtue! to &s;hare in her joy when happy, to ki&s;s away her tears when di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and to &s;ee her fly to my arms for comfort and &s;upport! Yes; if there is perfect bli&s;s on earth, 'tis his lot alone who becomes that angel's hu&s;band."</P>
<P>While his fancy coined the&s;e ideas, he paced his cell with a di&s;ordered air. His eyes were fixed upon vacan|cy; his head reclined upon his &s;houlder: a tear rolled down his cheek, while he reflected that the vi&s;ion of happine&s;s for him could never be realized.</P>
<P>"She is lo&s;t to me!" he continued; "by marriage &s;he cannot be mine: and to &s;educe &s;uch innocence, to u&s;e the confidence repo&s;ed in me to work her ruin&mdash;Oh! it would be a crime, blacker than yet the world ever witne&s;&s;ed! Fear not, lovely girl! your virtue runs no ri&s;k from me. Not for Indies would I make that gentle bo&s;om know the tortures of remor&s;e."</P>
<P>Again he paced his chamber ha&s;tily. Then &s;topping, his eye fell upon the picture of his once-admired Ma|dona. He tore it with indignation from the wall: he threw it on the ground, and &s;purned it from him with his foot.</P>
<P>"The pro&s;titute!"</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="035729_0280_10065A08C012FF48">
Unfortunate Matilda! her paramour forgot, that for his &s;ake alone &s;he had forfeited her claim to virtue; and his only rea&s;on for de&s;pi&s;ing her was, that &s;he loved him much too well.</P>
<P>He threw him&s;elf into a chair, which &s;tood near the table. He &s;aw the card with Elvira's addre&s;s. He took it up, and it brought to his recollection his prom|i&s;e re&s;pecting a confe&s;&s;or. He pa&s;&s;ed a few minutes in doubt: but Antonia's empire over him was already too much decided to permit his making a long re&s;i&s;t|ance to the idea which &s;truck him. He re&s;olved to be the confe&s;&s;or him&s;elf. He could leave the abbey un|ob&s;erved without difficulty: by wrapping up his head in his cowl, he hoped to pa&s;s through the &s;treets with|out being recognized: by taking the&s;e precautions, and by recommending &s;ecrecy to Elvira's family, he doubted not to keep Madrid in ignorance that he had broken his vow never to &s;ee the out&s;ide of the abbey walls. Matilda was the only per&s;on who&s;e vigilance he dreaded: but, by informing her at the refectory, that during the whole of that day bu&s;ine&s;s would con|fine him to his cell, he thought him&s;elf &s;ecure from her wakeful jealou&s;y. Accordingly, at the hours when the Spaniards are generally taking their &s;ie&s;ta, he ven|tured to quit the abbey by a private door, the key of which was in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The cowl of his habit was thrown over his face; from the heat of the weath|er the &s;treets were almo&s;t totally de&s;erted: the monk met with few people, found the &s;trada di San Iago, and arrived without accident at Donna Elvira's door. He rang, was admitted, and immediately u&s;hered into an upper apartment.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="035729_0281_100659D5D88B89F0">
It was here that he ran the greate&s;t ri&s;que of a di&s;|covery. Had Leonella been at home, &s;he would have recognized him directly. Her communicative di&s;po|&s;ition would never have permitted her to re&s;t, till all Madrid was informed that Ambro&s;io had ventured out of the abbey, and vi&s;ited her &s;i&s;ter. Fortune here &s;tood the monk's friend. On Leonella's return home, &s;he found a letter in&s;tructing her that a cou&s;in was ju&s;t dead, who had left what little he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed between her&s;elf and Elvira. To &s;ecure this beque&s;t, &s;he was obli|ged to &s;et out for Cordova without lo&s;ing a moment. Amid&s;t all her foibles, her heart was truly warm and affectionate, and &s;he was unwilling to quit her &s;i&s;ter in &s;o dangerous a &s;tate. But Elvira in&s;i&s;ted upon her tak|ing the journey, con&s;cious that, in her daughter's for|lorn &s;ituation, no increa&s;e of fortune, however trifling, ought to be neglected. Accordingly, Leonella left Ma|drid, &s;incerely grieved at her &s;i&s;ter's illne&s;s, and giving &s;ome few &s;ighs to the memory of the amiable but incon|&s;tant Don Chri&s;toval. She was fully per&s;uaded, that at fir&s;t &s;he had made a terrible breach in his heart; but hearing nothing more of him, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed that he had quitted the pur&s;uit, di&s;gu&s;ted by the lowne&s;s of her or|igin, and knowing upon other terms than marriage he had nothing to hope from &s;uch a dragon of virtue as &s;he profe&s;&s;ed her&s;elf; or el&s;e, that being naturally ca|pricious and changeable, the remembrance of her charms had been effaced from the conde's heart by tho&s;e of &s;ome newer beauty. Whatever was the cau&s;e of her lo&s;ing him, &s;he lamented it &s;orely. She &s;trove in vain (as &s;he a&s;&s;ured every body who was kind enough to li&s;ten to her) to tear his image from her too &s;u&s;ceptible heart. She affected the airs of a love|&s;ick virgin, and carried them all to the mo&s;t ridicu|lous
<PB N="27" REF="035729_0282_10065A0A494F02C8">
exce&s;s. She heaved lamentable &s;ighs, walked with her arms folded, uttered long &s;oliloquies, and her di&s;cour&s;e generally turned upon &s;ome for&s;aken maid who expired of a broken heart! Her fiery locks were always ornamented with a garland of willow. Every evening &s;he was &s;een &s;traying upon the banks of a riv|ulet by moon-light; and &s;he declared her&s;elf a violent admirer of murmuring &s;treams and nightingales&mdash;</P>
<LG>
<L>"Of lonely haunts, and twilight groves,</L>
<L>"Places which pale pa&s;&s;ion loves!"</L>
</LG>
<P>Such was the &s;tate of Leonella's mind when obliged to quit Madrid. Elvira was out of patience at all the&s;e follies, and endeavoured at per&s;uading her to act like a rea&s;onable woman. Her advice was thrown a|way: Leonella a&s;&s;ured her, at parting, that nothing could make her forget the perfidious Don Chri&s;toval. In this point &s;he was fortunately mi&s;taken. An hone&s;t youth of Cordova, journeyman to an apothecary, found that her fortune would be &s;ufficient to &s;et him up in a gen|teel &s;hop of his own. In con&s;equence of this reflection, he avowed him&s;elf her admirer. Leonella was not in|flexible; the ardour of his &s;ighs melted her heart, and &s;he &s;oon con&s;ented to make him the happie&s;t of man|kind. She wrote to inform her &s;i&s;ter of her marriage; but, for rea&s;ons which will be explained hereafter, El|vira never an&s;wered her letter.</P>
<P>Ambro&s;io was conducted into the anti-chamber to that where Elvira was repo&s;ing. The female dome&s;tic who had admitted him, left him alone, while &s;he an|nounced his arrival to her mi&s;tre&s;s. Antonia, who had been by her mother's bed-&s;ide, immediately came to him.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="035729_0283_100659D75F228908">
"Pardon me, father," &s;aid &s;he, advancing towards him: when recognizing his features, &s;he &s;topped &s;ud|denly, and uttered a cry of joy. "Is it po&s;&s;ible?" &s;he continued, "do not my eyes deceive me? Has the worthy Ambro&s;io broken through his re&s;olution, that he may &s;often the agonies of the be&s;t of women? What plea&s;ure will this vi&s;it give my mother! Let me not delay for a moment the comfort which your piety and wi&s;dom will afford her."</P>
<P>Thus &s;aying, &s;he opened the chamber-door, pre&s;ent|ed to her mother her di&s;tingui&s;hed vi&s;itor, and, having placed an arm-chair by the &s;ide of the bed, withdrew into another apartment.</P>
<P>Elvira was highly gratified by this vi&s;it; her expec|tations had been rai&s;ed high by general report, but &s;he found them far exceeded. Ambro&s;io, endowed by na|ture with powers of plea&s;ing, exerted them to the ut|mo&s;t, while conver&s;ing with Antonia's mother. With per&s;ua&s;ive eloquence he calmed every fear, and di&s;&s;ipat|ed every &s;cruple. He bade her reflect on the infinite mercy of her Judge, de&s;poiled death of his darts and terrors, and taught her to view without &s;hrinking, the aby&s;s of eternity, on who&s;e brink &s;he then &s;tood. El|vira was ab&s;orbed in attention and delight: while &s;he li&s;tened to his exhortations, confidence and comfort &s;tole in&s;en&s;ibly into her mind. She unbo&s;omed to him without he&s;itation, her cares and apprehen&s;ions. The latter re&s;pecting a future life he had already qui|eted, and he now removed the former, which &s;he felt for the concerns of this. She trembled for Antonia; &s;he had none to who&s;e care &s;he could recommend her, &s;ave to the marquis de las Ci&s;ternas and her &s;i&s;ter Leonella. The protection of the one was very uncertain; and as
<PB N="29" REF="035729_0284_10063CAFAEFDA5D8">
to the other, though fond of her niece, Leonella was &s;o thoughtle&s;s and vain, as to make her an improper per&s;on to have the &s;ole direction of a girl &s;o young and ignorant of the world. The friar no &s;ooner learned the cau&s;e of her alarms, than he begged her to make her&s;elf ea&s;y upon that head. He doubted not being able to &s;ecure for Antonia a &s;afe refuge in the hou&s;e of one of his penitents, the marchione&s;s of Villa-Franca: this was a lady of acknowledged virtue, remarkable for &s;trict principles and exten&s;ive charity. Should accident de|prive her of this re&s;ource, he engaged to procure An|tonia a reception in &s;ome re&s;pectable convent, that is to &s;ay, in quality of boarder; for Elvira had declared her&s;elf no friend to a mona&s;tic life, and the monk was either candid or complai&s;ant enough to allow that her di&s;approbation was not unfounded.</P>
<P>The&s;e proofs of the intere&s;t which he felt for her, completely won Elvira's heart. In thanking him, &s;he exhau&s;ted every expre&s;&s;ion which gratitude could fur|ni&s;h, and prote&s;ted, that now &s;he &s;hould re&s;ign her&s;elf with tranquillity to the grave.

Elvira commended equally his prudence and com|pa&s;&s;ion, promi&s;ing to conceal carefully the honour of his vi&s;its. The monk then gave her his benediction, and retired from the chamber.</P>
<P>In the anti-room he found Antonia; he could not refu&s;e him&s;elf the plea&s;ure of pa&s;&s;ing a few moments in her &s;ociety. He bade her take comfort, for that her mother &s;eemed compo&s;ed and tranquil, and he hoped that &s;he yet might do well. He enquired who attended her, and engaged to &s;end the phy&s;ician of his convent to &s;ee her, one of the mo&s;t &s;kilful in Madrid. He then launched out in Elvira's commendation, prai&s;|ed her purity and fortitude of mind, and declared that &s;he had in&s;pired him with the highe&s;t e&s;teem and rev|erence. Antonia's innocent heart &s;welled with grati|tude; joy danced in her eyes, where a tear &s;till &s;park|led. The hopes which he gave her of her mother's recovery, the lively intere&s;t which he &s;eemed to feel for her, and the flattering way in which &s;he was men|tioned by him, added to the report of his judgment and virtue, and to the impre&s;&s;ion made upon her by his eloquence, confirmed the favourable opinion with which his fir&s;t appearance had in&s;pired Antonia. She replied with diffidence, but without re&s;traint; &s;he fear|ed not to relate to him all her little &s;orrows, all her little fears and anxieties; and &s;he thanked him for his goodne&s;s with all the genuine warmth which fa|vours kindle in a young and innocent heart. <HI>Such a one alone knows how to e&s;timate benefits at their full value.</HI> They who are con&s;cious of mankind's perfidy and &s;elf|i&s;hne&s;s, ever receive an obligation with apprehen&s;ion; they &s;u&s;pect that &s;ome &s;ecret motive mu&s;t lurk behind it; they expre&s;s their thanks with re&s;traint and cau|tion,
<PB N="31" REF="035729_0286_10065A0D6990ABB8">
and fear to prai&s;e a kind action to its full extent, aware that on &s;ome future day a return may be requir|ed. Not &s;o Antonia&mdash;&s;he thought the world was compo&s;ed of tho&s;e only who re&s;embled her: and that vice exi&s;ted, was to her &s;till a &s;ecret. The monk had been of &s;ervice to her; he &s;aid that he wi&s;hed her well; &s;he was grateful for his kindne&s;s, and thought that no terms were &s;trong enough to be the vehicle of her thanks. With what delight did Ambro&s;io li&s;ten to the declaration of her artle&s;s gratitude! The natural grace of her manners, the unequalled &s;weetne&s;s of her voice, her mode&s;t vivacity, her un&s;tudied elegance, her expre&s;&s;ive countenance and intelligent eyes united to in&s;pire him with plea&s;ure and admiration; while the &s;olidity and correctne&s;s of her remarks received addi|tional beauty from the unaffected &s;implicity of the lan|guage in which they were conveyed.</P>
<P>Ambro&s;io was at length obliged to tear him&s;elf from this conver&s;ation, which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed for him but too many charms. He repeated to Antonia his wi&s;hes, that his vi&s;its &s;hould not be made known; which de|&s;ire &s;he promi&s;ed to ob&s;erve. He then quitted the hou&s;e, while his enchantre&s;s ha&s;tened to her mother, ignorant of the mi&s;chief which her beauty had cau&s;ed. She was eager to know Elvira's opinion of the man whom &s;he had prai&s;ed in &s;uch enthu&s;ia&s;tic terms, and was delighted to find it equally favourable, if not even more &s;o than her own.</P>
<P>"Even before he &s;poke," &s;aid Elvira, "I was prej|udiced in his favour: the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">vour of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, dignity of his manner, and clo&s;ene&s;s of his rea&s;oning, were very far from inducing me to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> my opinion.

but &s;urely, Antonia, I have heard it before. It &s;eemed perfectly familiar to my ear; either I mu&s;t have known the abbot in former times, or his voice bears a wonder|ful re&s;emblance to that of &s;ome other, to whom I have often li&s;tened. There were certain tones which touch|ed my very heart, and made me feel &s;en&s;ations &s;o &s;in|gular, that I &s;trive in vain to account for them."</P>
<P>"My deare&s;t mother, it produced the &s;ame effect upon me; yet certainly neither of us ever heard his voice till we came to Madrid. I &s;u&s;pect that what we attribute to his voice, really proceeds from his plea&s;ant manners, which forbid our con&s;idering him as a &s;tranger. I know not why, but I feel more at my ea&s;e while conver&s;ing with him, than I u&s;ually do with people who are unknown to me. I feared not to repeat to him all my childi&s;h thoughts; and &s;omehow I felt confident that he would hear my folly with in|dulgence. Oh! I was not deceived in him: he li&s;ten|ed to me with &s;uch an air of kindne&s;s and attention; he an&s;wered me with &s;uch gentlene&s;s, &s;uch conde&s;cen|&s;ion; he did not call me an infant, and treat me with contempt, as our cro&s;s old confe&s;&s;or at the Ca&s;tle u&s;ed to do. I verily believe, that if I had lived in Murcia a thou&s;and years, I never &s;hould have liked that fat old father Dominic!"</P>
<P>"I confe&s;s, that father Dominic had not the mo&s;t plea&s;ing manners in the world; but he was hone&s;t, friendly, and well-meaning."</P>
<P>"Ah! my dear mother, tho&s;e qualities are &s;o com|mon&mdash;"</P>
<P>"God grant, my child, that experience may not teach you to think them rare and precious! I have
<PB N="33" REF="035729_0288_10065A11FB19BAF0">
found them but too much &s;o. But tell me, Antonia, why is it impo&s;&s;ible for me to have &s;een the abbot be|fore?"</P>
<P>"Becau&s;e, &s;ince the moment when he entered the abbey he has never been on the out&s;ide of its walls. He told me ju&s;t now, that from his ignorance of the &s;treets he had &s;ome difficulty to find the &s;trada di San Iago, though &s;o near the abbey."</P>
<P>"All this is po&s;&s;ible, and &s;till I may have &s;een him <HI>before</HI> he entered the abbey: in order to come out, it was rather nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould fir&s;t go in."</P>
<P>"Holy Virgin! as you &s;ay, that is very true. Oh! but might he not have been born in the abbey?"</P>
<P>Elvira &s;miled.</P>
<P>"Why, not very ea&s;ily."</P>
<P>"Stay, &s;tay! Now I recollect how it was. He was put into the abbey quite a child; the common people &s;ay, that he fell from heaven, and was &s;ent as a pre&s;ent to the Capuchins by the Virgin."</P>
<P>"That was very kind of her. And &s;o he fell from heaven, Antonia? He mu&s;t have had a terrible tumble."</P>
<P>"Many do not credit this; and I fancy, my dear mother, that I mu&s;t number you among the unbeliev|ers. Indeed, as our landlady told my aunt, the gen|eral idea is, that his parents being poor and unable to maintain him, left him ju&s;t born at the abbey door; the late &s;uperior, from pure charity, had him educated in the convent; and he proved to be a model of vir|tue,
<PB N="34" REF="035729_0289_100659DE58E50FE8">
and piety, and learning, and I know not what el&s;e be&s;ides. In con&s;equence, he was fir&s;t received as a brother of the order, and not long ago was ho&s;en ab|bot. However, whether this account or the other is the true one&mdash;at lea&s;t all agree, that when the monks took him under their care he could not &s;peak; there|fore you could not have heard his voice before he en|tered the mona&s;tery, becau&s;e at that time he had no voice at all."</P>
<P>"Upon my word, Antonia, you argue very clo&s;ely; your conclu&s;ions are infallible. I did not &s;u&s;pect you of being &s;o able a logician."</P>
<P>"Ah! you are mocking me; but &s;o much the bet|ter. It delights me to &s;ee you in &s;pirits; be&s;ides, you &s;eem tranquil and ea&s;y, and I hope that you will have no more convul&s;ions. Oh! I was &s;ure the abbot's vi&s;it would do you good."</P>
<P>"It has indeed done me good, my child. He has quieted my mind upon &s;ome points which agitated me, and I already feel the effects of his attention. My eyes grow heavy, and I think I can &s;leep a little. Draw the curtains, my Antonia; but if I &s;hould not wake before midnight, do not &s;it up with me, I charge you."</P>
<P>Antonia promi&s;ed to obey her; and, having received her ble&s;&s;ing, drew the curtains of the bed. She then &s;eated her&s;elf in &s;ilence at her embroidery-frame, and beguiled the hours with building ca&s;tles in the air. Her &s;pirits were enlivened by the evident change for the better in Elvira, and her fancy pre&s;ented her with vi|&s;ions bright and plea&s;ing. In the&s;e dreams Ambro&s;io made no de&s;picable figure. She thought of him with
<PB N="35" REF="035729_0290_10065A13874505E0">
joy and gratitude; but for every idea which fell to the friar's &s;hare, at lea&s;t two were uncon&s;ciou&s;ly be&s;towed upon Lorenzo. Thus pa&s;&s;ed the time till the bell in the neighbouring &s;teeple of the Capuchin cathedral an|nounced the hour of midnight. Antonia remembered her mother's injuctions, and obeyed them, though with reluctance. She undrew the curtains with caution. Elvira was enjoying a profound and quiet &s;lumber; her cheek glowed with health's returning colours; a &s;mile declared that her dreams were plea&s;ant, and as Antonia bent over her &s;he fancied that &s;he heard her name pronounced, She ki&s;&s;ed her mother's forehead &s;oftly, and retired to her chamber; there &s;he knelt be|fore a &s;tatue of St. Ro&s;olia, her patrone&s;s; &s;he recom|mended her&s;elf to the protection of Heaven, and, as had been her cu&s;tom from infancy, concluded her de|votions by chaunting the following &s;tanzas:</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>RETURNED undi&s;covered to the abbey, Am|bro&s;io's mind was filled with the mo&s;t plea&s;ing images. He was wilfully blind to the danger of ex|po&s;ing him&s;elf to Antonia's charms: he only remem|bered the plea&s;ure which her &s;ociety had afforded him, and rejoiced in the pro&s;pect of that plea&s;ure being re|peated. He failed not to profit by Elvira's indi&s;po&s;i|tion to obtain a &s;ight of her daughter every day. At fir&s;t he bounded his wi&s;hes to in&s;pire Antonia with friend&s;hip: but no &s;ooner was he convinced that &s;he felt that &s;entiment in its fulle&s;t extent, than his aim became more decided, and his attentions a&s;&s;umed a warmer colour. The innocent familiarity with which &s;he treated him, gave him encouragement. Grown u&s;ed to her mode&s;ty, it no longer commanded the &s;ame re&s;pect and awe: he &s;till admired it, but it only made him more anxious to deprive her of that which formed her principal charm. His natural pen|etration, of which, unfortunately both for him&s;elf and Antonia, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an ample &s;hare, &s;upplied a knowledge of the arts of &s;eduction. He ea&s;ily di&s;tin|gui&s;hed the emotions which were favourable to his de|&s;igns, and &s;eized every means with avidity of infu&s;ing
<PB N="39" REF="035729_0294_10065A1735B06668">
corruption into Antonia's bo&s;om. This he found no ea&s;y matter. Extreme &s;implicity prevented her from perceiving the aim to which the monk's in&s;inuations tended; but the excellent morals which &s;he owed to Elvira's care, the &s;olidity and correctne&s;s of her un|der&s;tanding, and a &s;trong &s;en&s;e of what was right, im|planted in her heart by nature, made her feel that his precepts mu&s;t be faulty. By a few &s;imple words &s;he frequently overthrew the whole bulk of his &s;ophi&s;tical arguments, and made him con&s;cious how weak they were when oppo&s;ed to virtue and truth. On &s;uch oc|ca&s;ions he took refuge in his eloquence; he over|powered her with a torrent of philo&s;ophical paradoxes, to which, not under&s;tanding them, it was impo&s;&s;ible for her to reply; and thus, though he did not con|vince her that his rea&s;oning was ju&s;t, he at lea&s;t pre|vented her from di&s;covering it to be fal&s;e. He per|ceived that her re&s;pect for his judgment augmented daily, and doubted not with time to bring her to the point de&s;ired.</P>
<P>He was not uncon&s;cious that his attempts were highly criminal. He &s;aw clearly the ba&s;ene&s;s of &s;educing the innocent girl; but his pa&s;&s;ion was too violent to permit his abandoning his de&s;ign. He re&s;olved to pur&s;ue it, let the con&s;equences be what they might. He depended upon finding An|tonia in &s;ome unguarded moment; and &s;eeing no other man admitted into her &s;ociety, nor hearing any mentioned either by her or Elvira, he imag|ined that her young heart was &s;till unoccupied. In the mean while every day increa&s;ed his coldne&s;s for Matilda. Not a little was this occa&s;ioned by the con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="40" REF="035729_0295_10065A54033198B0">
of his faults to her. To hide them from her, he was not &s;ufficiently ma&s;ter of him&s;elf; yet he dreaded le&s;t, in a tran&s;port of jealous rage, &s;he &s;hould betray the &s;ecret on which his character and even his life depended. Matilda could not but remark his in|difference: he was con&s;cious that &s;he remarked it, and, fearing her reproaches, &s;hunned her &s;tudiou&s;ly. Yet, when he could not avoid her, her mildne&s;s might have convinced him that he had nothing to dread from her re&s;entment. She had re&s;umed the character of the gentle intere&s;ting Ro&s;ario: &s;he taxed him not with ingratitude; but her eyes filled with involuntary tears, and the &s;oft melancholy of her countenance and voice uttered complaints far more touching than words could have conveyed. Ambro&s;io was not unmoved by her &s;orrow; but, unable to remove its cau&s;e, he forbore to &s;how that it affected him. As her conduct convinced him that he needed not fear her vengeance, he continued to neglect her, and avoided her company with care. Matilda &s;aw that &s;he in vain attempted to regain his affections; yet &s;he &s;tifled the impul&s;e of re|&s;entment, and continued to treat her incon&s;tant lover with her former fondne&s;s and affection.</P>
<P>By degrees Elvira's con&s;titution recovered it&s;elf. She was no longer troubled with convul&s;ions, and An|tonia cea&s;ed to tremble for her mother. Ambro&s;io be|held this re-e&s;tabli&s;hment with di&s;plea&s;ure. He &s;aw that Elvira's knowledge of the world would not be the dupe of his &s;anctified demeanor, and that &s;he would ea&s;ily perceive his views upon her daughter. He re&s;olved therefore, before &s;he quitted her chamber, to try the extent of his influence over the innocent An|tonia.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="035729_0296_10065AF5398FCB48">
One evening, when he had found Elvira almo&s;t per|fectly re&s;tored to health, he quitted her earlier than was his u&s;ual cu&s;tom. Not finding Antonia in the an|ti-chamber, he ventured to follow her to her own. It was only &s;eparated from her mother's by a clo&s;et, in which Flora, the waiting woman, generally &s;lept. Antonia &s;at upon a &s;ofa with her back towards the door, and read attentively. She heard not his ap|proach, till he had &s;eated him&s;elf by her. She &s;tarted, and welcomed him with a look of plea&s;ure: then ri&s;|ing, &s;he would have conducted him to the &s;itting room; but Ambro&s;io, taking her hand, obliged her by gentle violence to re&s;ume her place. She compli|ed without difficulty; &s;he knew not that there was more impropriety in conver&s;ing with him in one room than another. She thought her&s;elf equally &s;ecure; and having replaced her&s;elf upon the &s;ofa, &s;he began to di&s;cour&s;e with him with her u&s;ual ea&s;e and vivacity.</P>
<P>Antonia &s;poke of her mother's health with all the enthu&s;ia&s;tic joy of a youthful heart.</P>
<P>"I admire your filial affection," &s;aid the abbot; "it proves the excellence and &s;en&s;ibility of your char|acter; it promi&s;es a trea&s;ure to him whom Heaven has de&s;tined to po&s;&s;e&s;s your affections. The brea&s;t &s;o capable of fondne&s;s for a parent, what will it feel for a lover! Nay, perhaps, what feels it for one even now! Tell me, my lovely daughter, have you known what it is to love? An&s;wer me with &s;incerity: forget my habit, and con&s;ider me only as a friend."</P>
<P>"What it is to love?" &s;aid &s;he, repeating his que&s;|tion. "Oh! yes, undoubtedly; I have loved many, many people."</P>

<P>This was an untruth, but &s;he was uncon&s;cious of its fal&s;ehood: &s;he knew not the nature of her &s;enti|ments for Lorenzo; and never having &s;een him &s;ince his fir&s;t vi&s;it to Elvira&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ith every day his image grew le&s;s forcibly impre&s;&s;ed upon her bo&s;om: be&s;ides, &s;he thought of an hu&s;band with all a virgin's terror, and negatived the friar's demand without a moment's he&s;|itation.</P>
<P>"And do you not long to &s;ee that man, Anto|nia? Do you feel no void in your heart, which you fain would have filled up?

"Have you &s;een no man, Antonia, whom, though never &s;een before, you &s;eemed long to have &s;ought? who&s;e form, though a &s;tranger's, was familiar to your eyes? the &s;ound of who&s;e voice &s;oothed you, plea&s;ed you, penetrated to your very &s;oul? in who&s;e pre&s;ence you rejoiced, for who&s;e ab&s;ence you lamented? with whom your heart &s;eemed to expand, and in who&s;e bo|&s;om, with confidence unbounded, you repo&s;ed the cares of your own? Have you not felt all this, Anto|nia?"</P>
<P>"Certainly I have: the fir&s;t time that I &s;aw you, I felt it."</P>
<P>Ambro&s;io &s;tarted. Scarcely dared he credit his hearing.</P>
<P>"Me, Antonia?" he cried, his eyes &s;parkling with delight and impatience, while he &s;eized her hand, and pre&s;&s;ed it rapturou&s;ly to his lips&punc; "Me, Antonia? You felt tho&s;e &s;entiments for me?"</P>
<P>"Even with more &s;trength than you have de&s;crib|ed. The very moment that I beheld you, I felt &s;o plea&s;ed, &s;o intere&s;ted! I waited &s;o eagerly to catch the &s;ound of your voice; and, when I heard it, it &s;eemed &s;o &s;weet! it &s;poke to me a language till then &s;o un|known! Methought it told me a thou&s;and things which I wi&s;hed to hear! It &s;eemed as if I had long known you; as if I had a right to your friend&s;hip, your advice, and your protection. I wept when you departed, and longed for the time which &s;hould re|&s;tore you to my &s;ight."</P>
<P>"Antonia! my charming Antonia!" exclaimed the
<PB N="44" REF="035729_0299_10065A5751579B10">
monk, and caught her to his bo&s;om: "Can I believe my &s;en&s;es? repeat it to me, my &s;weet girl! Tell me again that you love me, that you love me truly and tenderly!"</P>
<P>"Indeed, I do: let my mother be excepted, and the world holds no one more dear to me."</P>
<P>At this frank avowal Ambro&s;io no longer po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf: he cla&s;ped the blu&s;hing trembler in his arms. He fa&s;tened his lips greedily upon hers, and &s;ucked in her pure delicious breath. Startled, alarmed, and con|fu&s;ed at his action, &s;urpri&s;e at fir&s;t deprived her of the power of re&s;i&s;tance. At length recovering her&s;elf, &s;he &s;trove to e&s;cape from his embrace.</P>
<P>"Father!&mdash;Ambro&s;io!" &s;he cried, "relea&s;e me; for God's &s;ake!"</P>
<P>But the monk heeded not her prayers. Antonia prayed, wept, and &s;truggled: terrified to the extreme, though at what &s;he knew not, &s;he exerted all her &s;trength to repul&s;e the friar, and was on the point of &s;hrieking for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, when the chamber door was &s;uddenly thrown open. Ambro&s;io had ju&s;t &s;ufficient pre&s;ence of mind to be &s;en&s;ible of his danger. Re|luctantly he relea&s;ed Antonia, who uttered an exclama|tion of joy, flew towards the door, and found her&s;elf cla&s;ped in the arms of her mother.</P>
<P>Alarmed at &s;ome of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">, which An|tonia had innocently repeated, Elvira re&s;olved to a&s;cer|tain the truth of her &s;u&s;picions. She had known enough of mankind, not to be impo&s;ed upon by the monk's reputed virtue. She reflected on &s;everal cir|cum&s;tances, which&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> trifling, on being put to|gether
<PB N="45" REF="035729_0300_10065A1DE8C7E930">
&s;eemed to authorize her fears. His frequent vi&s;its, which, as far as &s;he could &s;ee, were confined to her family; his evident emotion, whenever &s;he &s;poke of Antonia; his youth; and above all, his pernicious philo&s;ophy communicated to her by Antonia, and which accorded but ill with his conver&s;ation in her pre&s;ence; all the&s;e circum&s;tances in&s;pired her with doubts re&s;pecting the purity of Ambro&s;io's friend&s;hip. In con&s;equence &s;he re&s;olved, when he &s;hould next be alone with Antonia, to endeavor at &s;urpri&s;ing him. Her plan had &s;ucceeded. 'Tis true, that when &s;he en|tered the room, he had already abandoned his prey; but her daughter's alarm, and the &s;hame and confu&s;ion &s;tamped upon the friar's countenance, &s;ufficed to prove that her &s;u&s;picions were well founded. However, &s;he was too prudent to make tho&s;e &s;u&s;picions known. She judged, that to unma&s;k the impo&s;tor would be no ea&s;y matter, the public being &s;o much prejudiced in his favour: and having but few friends, &s;he thought it dangerous to make her&s;elf &s;o powerful an enemy. She affected therefore not to remark his agitation, &s;eated her&s;elf tranquilly upon the &s;ofa, a&s;&s;igned &s;ome trifling rea&s;on for having quitted her room unexpectedly, and conver&s;ed on various &s;ubjects with &s;eeming confidence and ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Rea&s;&s;ured by her behaviour, the monk began to re|cover him&s;elf. He &s;trove to an&s;wer Elvira without appearing embarra&s;&s;ed: but he was &s;till too great a novice in di&s;&s;imulation, and he felt that he mu&s;t look confu&s;ed and awkward. He &s;oon broke off the con|ver&s;ation, and ro&s;e to depart. What was his vexation when, on taking leave, Elvira told him, in polite terms, that being now perfectly ree&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;he
<PB N="46" REF="035729_0301_10065A58DF74C7B8">
thought it an inju&s;tice to deprive others of his company who might be more in need of it! She a&s;&s;ured him of her eternal gratitude, for the benefit which during her illne&s;s &s;he had derived from his &s;ociety and exhorta|tions: and &s;he lamented that her dome&s;tic affairs, as well as the multitude of bu&s;ine&s;s which his &s;ituation mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity impo&s;e upon him, would in future deprive her of the plea&s;ure of his vi&s;its. Though de|livered in the milde&s;t language, this hint was too plain to be mi&s;taken. Still he was preparing to put in a re|mon&s;trance, when an expre&s;&s;ive look from Elvira &s;top|ped him &s;hort. He dared not pre&s;s her to receive him, for her manner convinced him that he was di&s;covered: he &s;ubmitted without reply, took an ha&s;ty leave, and retired to the abbey, his heart filled with rage and &s;hame, with bitterne&s;s and di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>Antonia's mind felt relieved by his departure; yet &s;he could not help lamenting that &s;he was never to &s;ee him more. Elvira al&s;o felt a &s;ecret &s;orrow; &s;he had received too much plea&s;ure from thinking him her friend, not to regret the nece&s;&s;ity of changing her opinion: but her mind was too much accu&s;tomed to the fallacy of worldly friend&s;hips to permit her pre&s;ent di&s;appointment to weigh upon it long. She now en|deavoured to make her daughter aware of the ri&s;k which &s;he had run; but &s;he was obliged to treat the &s;ubject with caution, le&s;t, in removing the bandage of ignorance, the veil of innocence &s;hould be rent away. She therefore contented her&s;elf with warning Antonia to be upon her guard, and ordering her, &s;hould the ab|bot per&s;i&s;t in his vi&s;its, never to receive them but in company. With this injunction Antonia promi&s;ed to comply.</P>

Ambro&s;io ha&s;tened to his cell. He clo&s;ed the door after him, and threw him&s;elf upon the bed in de&s;pair. The impul&s;e of de&s;ire, the &s;tings of di&s;appointment, the &s;hame of detection, and the fear of being publicly unma&s;ked, rendered his bo&s;om a &s;cene of the mo&s;t hor|rible confu&s;ion. He knew not what cour&s;e to pur&s;ue. Debarred the pre&s;ence of Antonia, he had no hopes of &s;atisfying that pa&s;&s;ion which was now become a part of his exi&s;tence.

With the dire&s;t imprecations he vowed vengeance again&s;t her; he &s;wore that, co&s;t what it would, he &s;till would po&s;&s;e&s;s Antonia. Starting from the bed, he paced the chamber with di&s;ordered &s;teps, howled with impotent fury, da&s;hed him&s;elf violently again&s;t the walls, and indulged all the tran&s;ports of rage and madne&s;s.</P>
<P>He was &s;till under the influence of this &s;torm of pa&s;&s;ions, when he heard a gentle knock at the door of his cell. Con&s;cious that his voice mu&s;t have been heard, he dared not refu&s;e admittance to the impor|tuner. He &s;trove to compo&s;e him&s;elf, and to hide his agitation. Having in &s;ome degree &s;ucceeded, he drew back the bolt: the door opened, and Matilda appeared.</P>
<P>At this preci&s;e moment there was no one with who&s;e pre&s;ence he could better have di&s;pen&s;ed. He had not &s;ufficient command over him&s;elf to conceal his vexation. He &s;tarted back, and frowned.</P>

Matilda heeded him not: &s;he again fa&s;tened the door, and then advanced towards him with an air gen|tle and &s;upplicating.</P>
<P>"Forgive me, Ambro&s;io," &s;aid &s;he; "for your own &s;ake I mu&s;t not obey you. Fear no complaints from me; I come not to reproach you with your ingrati|tude.

I formerly mentioned, that my guardian was a man of uncom|mon knowledge. He took pains to in&s;til that know|ledge into my infant mind. Among the various &s;ci|ences which curio&s;ity had induced him to explore, he neglected not that which by mo&s;t is e&s;teemed impious, and by many chimerical: I &s;peak of tho&s;e arts which relate to the world of &s;pirits. His deep re&s;earches into cau&s;es and effects, his unwearied application to the &s;tudy of natural philo&s;ophy, his profound and un|limited knowledge of the properties and virtues of every gem which enriches the deep, of every herb which the earth produces, at length procured him the di&s;tinction which he had &s;ought &s;o long, &s;o earne&s;tly.
<PB N="50" REF="035729_0305_10065A5ED43848E8">
His curio&s;ity was fully &s;laked, his ambition amply gratified. He gave laws to the elements: he could rever&s;e the order of nature: his eye read the mandates of futurity, and the infernal &s;pirits were &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to his commands. Why &s;hrink you from me? I under|&s;tand that inquiring look. Your &s;u&s;picions are right, though your terrors are unfounded. My guardian con|cealed not from me his mo&s;t precious acqui&s;ition. Yet, had I never &s;een <HI>you,</HI> I &s;hould never have exerted my power. Like you, I &s;huddered at the thoughts of magic. Like you, I had formed a terrible idea of the con&s;equences of rai&s;ing a daemon. To pre&s;erve that life which your love had taught me to prize, I had recour&s;e to means which I trembled at employing. You remember that night which I pa&s;&s;ed in St. Clare's &s;epulchre? Then was it that, &s;urrounded by moulder|ing bodies, I dared to perform tho&s;e my&s;tic rites, which &s;ummoned to my aid a fallen angel. Judge what mu&s;t have been my joy at di&s;covering that my terrors were imaginary. I &s;aw the daemon obedient to my orders: I &s;aw him trembling at my frown: and found that, in&s;tead of &s;elling my &s;oul to a ma&s;ter, my courage had purcha&s;ed for my&s;elf a &s;lave."</P>
<P>"Ra&s;h Matilda! What have you done? You have doomed your&s;elf to endle&s;s perdition; you have bar|tered for momentary power, eternal happine&s;s! If on witchcraft depends the fruition of my de&s;ires, I re|nounce your aid mo&s;t ab&s;olutely. The con&s;equences are too horrible.

They pa&s;s|ed into the burying ground unob&s;erved, opened the door of the &s;epulchre, and found them&s;elves at the head of the &s;ubterraneous &s;tairca&s;e. As yet the beams of the full moon had guided their &s;teps, but that re|&s;ource now failed them. Matilda had neglected to provide her&s;elf with a lamp. Still holding Ambro|&s;io's hand &s;he de&s;cended the marble &s;teps; but the profound ob&s;curity with which they were over&s;pread, obliged them to walk &s;low and cautiou&s;ly.</P>
<P>"You tremble!" &s;aid Matilda to her companion; "fear not, the de&s;tined &s;pot is near."</P>
<P>They reached the foot of the &s;tairca&s;e; and con|tinued to proceed, feeling their way along the walls. On turning a corner, &s;uddenly they de&s;cried faint gleams of light, which &s;eemed burning at a di&s;tance. Thither they bent their &s;teps. The rays proceeded from a &s;mall &s;epulchral lamp which flamed uncea&s;|ingly before the &s;tatue of St. Clare. It tinged with dim and cheerle&s;s beams the ma&s;&s;y columns which &s;upported the roof, but was too feeble to di&s;&s;ipate the thick gloom in which the vaults above were buried.</P>
<P>Matilda took the lamp.</P>
<P>"Wait for me!" &s;aid &s;he to the friar; "in a few moments I am here again."</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="035729_0311_10065A63A2EF34F0">
With the&s;e words &s;he ha&s;tened into one of the pa&s;|&s;ages, which branched in various directions from this &s;pot and formed a &s;ort of labyrinth. Ambro&s;io was now left alone. Darkne&s;s the mo&s;t profound &s;ur|rounded him, and encouraged the doubts which began to revive in his bo&s;om. He had been hurried away by the delirium of the moment. The &s;hame of betray|ing his terrors, while in Matilda's pre&s;ence, had in|duced him to repre&s;s them; but, now that he was abandoned to him&s;elf, they re&s;umed their former a&s;|cendancy. He trembled at the &s;cene which he was &s;oon to witne&s;s. He knew not how far the delu&s;ions of magic might operate upon his mind; they po&s;&s;ibly might force him to &s;ome deed, who&s;e commi&s;&s;ion would make the breach between him&s;elf and heaven irreparable. In this fearful dilemma, he would have implored God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but was con&s;cious that he had forfeited all claim to &s;uch protection. Gladly would he have returned to the abbey; but as he had pa&s;&s;ed through innumerable caverns and winding pa&s;|&s;ages, the attempt of regaining the &s;tairs was hopele&s;s. His fate was determined; no po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;cape pre|&s;ented it&s;elf. He therefore combated his apprehen|&s;ions, and called every argument to his &s;uccour, which might enable him to &s;upport the trying &s;cene with for|titude. He reflected, that Antonia would be the re|ward of his daring. He inflamed his imagination by enumerating her charms. He per&s;uaded him&s;elf, that (as Matilda had ob&s;erved) he always &s;hould have time &s;ufficient for repentance; and that, as he em|ployed <HI>her</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;tance, not that of daemons, the crime of &s;orcery could not be laid to his charge. He had read much re&s;pecting witchcraft; he under&s;tood that, un|le&s;s
<PB N="57" REF="035729_0312_10065A2ABB48C200">
a formal act was &s;igned renouncing his claim to &s;alvation, Satan would have no power over him. He was fully determined not to execute any &s;uch act, whatever threats might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e u&s;ed, or advantages held out to him.</P>
<P>Such were his meditations while waiting for Ma|tilda. They were interrupted by a low murmur, which &s;eemed at no great di&s;tance from him. He was &s;tartled&mdash;he li&s;tened. Some minutes pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ilence, after which the murmur was repeated. It appeared to be the groaning of one in pain. In any other &s;ituation, this circum&s;tance would only have ex|cited his attention and curio&s;ity. In the pre&s;ent, his predominant &s;en&s;ation was that of terror. His imag|ination totally engro&s;&s;ed by the ideas of &s;orcery and &s;pirits, he fancied that &s;ome unquiet gho&s;t was wan|dering near him; or el&s;e that Matilda had fallen a victim to her pre&s;umption, and was peri&s;hing under the cruel fangs of the daemons. The noi&s;e &s;eemed not to approach, but continued to be heard at intervals. Sometimes it became more audible&mdash;doubtle&s;s, as the &s;ufferings of the per&s;on who uttered the groans be|came more acute and in&s;upportable. Ambro&s;io now and then thought that he could di&s;tingui&s;h accents, and once in particular he was almo&s;t convinced that he heard a faint voice exclaim,</P>
<P>"God! Oh! God! No hope! No &s;uccour!"</P>
<P>Yet deeper groans followed the&s;e words: they died away gradually, and univer&s;al &s;ilence again prevailed.</P>
<P>"What can this mean?" thought the bewildered monk.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="035729_0313_10065A68563541C8">
At that moment an idea which fla&s;hed into his mind, almo&s;t petrified him with horror. He &s;tarted and &s;huddered at him&s;elf.</P>
<P>"Should it be po&s;&s;ible!" he groaned involuntarily; "&s;hould it but be po&s;&s;ible; Oh! what a mon&s;ter am I!"</P>
<P>He wi&s;hed to re&s;olve his doubts, and to repair his fault, if it were not too late already. But the&s;e gen|erous and compa&s;&s;ionate &s;entiments were &s;oon put to flight by the return of Matilda. He forgot the groan|ing &s;ufferer, and remembered nothing but the danger and embarra&s;&s;ment of his own &s;ituation. The light of the returning lamp gilded the walls, and in a few mo|ments after Matilda &s;tood be&s;ide him. She had quit|ted her religious habit: &s;he was now clothed in a long &s;able robe, on which was traced in gold embroidery a variety of unknown characters: it was fa&s;tened by a girdle of precious &s;tones, in which was fixed a poniard. Her neck and arms were uncovered; in her hand &s;he bore a golden wand; her hair was loo&s;e, and flowed wildly upon her &s;houlders; her eyes &s;parkled with terrific expre&s;&s;ion; and her whole demeanor was cal|culated to in&s;pire the beholder with awe and admira|tion.</P>
<P>"Follow me!" &s;he &s;aid to the monk in a low and &s;olemn voice; "all is ready."</P>
<P>His limbs trembled while he obeyed her. She led him through various narrow pa&s;&s;ages; and on every &s;ide, as they pa&s;&s;ed along, the beams of the lamp di&s;|played none but the mo&s;t revolting objects; &s;culls, bones, graves, and images who&s;e eyes &s;eemed to glare
<PB N="59" REF="035729_0314_10065A2DBA0C5618">
on them with horror and &s;urpri&s;e. At length they reached a &s;pacious cavern, who&s;e lofty roof the eye &s;ought in vain to di&s;cover. A profound ob&s;curity hov|ered through the void; damp vapours &s;truck cold to the friar's heart, and he li&s;tened &s;adly to the bla&s;t while it howled along the lonely vaults. Here Ma|tilda &s;topped. She turned to Ambro&s;io. His cheeks and lips were pale with apprehen&s;ion. By a glance of mingled &s;corn and anger &s;he reproved his pu&s;illa|nimity, but &s;he &s;poke not. She placed the lamp upon the ground near the ba&s;ket. She motioned that Am|bro&s;io &s;hould be &s;ilent, and began the my&s;terious rites. She drew a circle round him, another round her&s;elf; and then, taking a &s;mall phial from the ba&s;ket, poured a few drops upon the ground before her. She bent over the place, muttered &s;ome indi&s;tinct &s;entences, and immediately a pale &s;ulphurous flame aro&s;e from the ground. It increa&s;ed by degrees, and at length &s;pread its waves over the whole &s;urface, the circles alone ex|cepted in which &s;tood Matilda and the monk. It then a&s;cended the huge columns of unhewn &s;tone, glided along the roof, and formed the cavern into an im|men&s;e chamber totally covered with blue trembling fire. It emitted no heat: on the contrary, the ex|treme chillne&s;s of the place &s;eemed to augment with every moment. Matilda continued her incantations; at intervals &s;he took various articles from the ba&s;ket, the nature and name of mo&s;t of which were unknown to the friar; but among the few which he di&s;tingui&s;h|ed, he particularly ob&s;erved three human fingers, and an agnus dei which &s;he broke in pieces. She threw them all into the flames which burned before her, and they were in&s;tantly con&s;umed.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="035729_0315_10065A69E0C38320">
The monk beheld her with anxious curio&s;ity. Sud|denly &s;he uttered a loud and piercing &s;hriek. She ap|peared to be &s;eized with an exce&s;s of delirium; &s;he tore her hair, beat her bo&s;om, u&s;ed the mo&s;t frantic ge&s;tures, and, drawing the poniard from her girdle, plunged it into her left arm. The blood gu&s;hed out plentifully; and, as &s;he &s;tood on the brink of the cir|cle, &s;he took care that it &s;hould fall on the out&s;ide. The flames retired from the &s;pot on which the blood was pouring. A volume of dark clouds ro&s;e &s;lowly from the en&s;anguined earth, and a&s;cended gradually till it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the vault of the cavern. At the &s;ame time a clap of thunder was heard, the echo pealed fear|fully along the &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;ages, and the ground &s;hook beneath the feet of the enchantre&s;s.</P>
<P>It was now that Ambro&s;io repented of his ra&s;hne&s;s. The &s;olemn &s;ingularity of the charm had prepared him for &s;omething &s;trange and horrible. He waited with fear for the &s;pirit's appearance, who&s;e coming was announced by thunder and earthquakes. He looked wildly around him, expecting that &s;ome dreadful ap|parition would meet his eyes, the &s;ight of which would drive him mad. A cold &s;hivering &s;eized his body, and he &s;unk upon one knee, unable to &s;upport him&s;elf.</P>
<P>"He comes!" exclaimed Matilda in a joyful ac|cent.</P>
<P>Ambro&s;io &s;tarted, and expected the daemon with terror. What was his &s;urpri&s;e when, the thunder cea&s;ing to roll, a full &s;train of melodious mu&s;ic &s;ounded in the air! At the &s;ame time the cloud di&s;appeared, and he beheld a figure more beautiful than fancy's pen|cil
<PB N="61" REF="035729_0316_10065A30D865FCA8">
ever drew. It was a youth &s;eemingly &s;carce eighteen, the perfection of who&s;e form and face was unrivalled. He was perfectly naked: a bright &s;tar &s;parkled upon his forehead, two crim&s;on wings ex|tended them&s;elves from his &s;houlders, and his &s;ilken locks were confined by a band of many coloured fires, which played round his head, formed them&s;elves into a variety of figures, and &s;hone with a brilliancy far &s;urpa&s;&s;ing that of precious &s;tones. Circlets of dia|monds were fa&s;tened round his arms and ankles, and in his right hand he bore a &s;ilver branch imitating myr|tle. His form &s;hone with dazzling glory: he was &s;urrounded by clouds of ro&s;e coloured light, and at the moment he appeared, a refre&s;hing air breathed per|fumes through the cavern. Enchanted at a vi&s;ion &s;o contrary to his expectations, Ambro&s;io gazed upon the &s;pirit with delight and wonder: yet, however beautiful the figure, he could not but remark a wild|ne&s;s in the daemon's eyes, and a my&s;terious melan|choly imprested upon his features, betraying the fallen angel, and in&s;piring the &s;pectators with &s;ecret awe.</P>
<P>The mu&s;ic cea&s;ed. Matilda addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to the &s;pirit: &s;he &s;poke in a language unintelligible to the monk, and was an&s;wered in the &s;ame. She &s;eemed to in&s;i&s;t upon &s;omething which the daemon was unwilling to grant. He frequently darted upon Ambro&s;io angry glances, and at &s;uch times the friar's heart &s;unk with|in him. Matilda appeared to grow incen&s;ed; &s;he &s;poke in a loud and commanding tone, and her ge&s;tures declared that &s;he was threatening him with her ven|geance. Her menaces had the de&s;ired effect. The &s;pirit &s;unk upon his knee, and with a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive air pre&s;ented to her the branch of myrtle. No &s;ooner
<PB N="62" REF="035729_0317_10065A6B72E60F50">
had &s;he received it, than the mu&s;ic was again heard; a thick cloud &s;pread it&s;elf over the apparition; the blue flames di&s;appeared, and total ob&s;curity reigned through the cave. The abbot moved not from his place: his faculties were all bound up in plea&s;ure, anxiety, and &s;urpri&s;e. At length the darkne&s;s di&s;|per&s;ing, he perceived Matilda &s;tanding near him in her religious habit, with the myrtle in her hand. No traces remained of the incantation, and the vaults were only illuminated by the faint rays of the &s;epul|chral lamp.</P>
<P>"I have &s;ucceeded," &s;aid Matilda, "though with more difficulty than I expected. Lucifer, whom I &s;ummoned to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, was at fir&s;t unwilling to obey my commands: to enforce his compliance, I was con&s;trained to have recour&s;e to my &s;tronge&s;t charms. They have produced the de&s;ired effect, but I have engaged never more to invoke his agency in your favour. Beware, then, how you employ an op|portunity which never will return. My magic arts will now be of no u&s;e to you: in future you can only hope for &s;upernatural aid, by invoking the daemons your&s;elf, and accepting the conditions of their &s;ervice. This you will never do. You want &s;trength of mind to force them to obedience; and unle&s;s you pay their e&s;tabli&s;hed price, they will not be your voluntary &s;er|vants. In this one in&s;tance they con&s;ent to obey you; I, offer you the means of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing your mi&s;tre&s;s, and be careful not to lo&s;e the opportunity. Receive this con&s;tellated myrtle: while you bear this in your hand, every door will fly open to you. It will procure you acce&s;s to-morrow night to Antonia's chamber: then
<PB N="63" REF="035729_0318_10065A3263541528">
breathe upon it thrice, pronounce her name, and place it upon her pillow. A death like &s;lumber will im|mediately &s;eize upon her, and hold her till break of morning. In this &s;tate you may &s;atisfy your de&s;ires without danger of being di&s;covered; &s;ince, when day|light &s;hall di&s;pel the effects of the enchantment, An|tonia will perceive her di&s;honor, but be ignorant of the ravi&s;her. Be happy then, my Ambro&s;io, and let this &s;ervice convince you that my friend&s;hip is di&s;in|tere&s;ted and pure. The night mu&s;t be near expiring: let us return to the abbey, le&s;t our ab&s;ence &s;hould cre|ate &s;urpri&s;e."</P>
<P>The abbot received the tali&s;man with &s;ilent grati|tude. His ideas were too much bewildered by the ad|ventures of the night, to permit his expre&s;&s;ing his thanks audibly, or indeed as yet to feel the whole value of her pre&s;ent. Matilda took up her lamp and ba&s;ket, and guided her companion from the my&s;teri|ous cavern. She re&s;tored the lamp to its former place, and continued her route in darkne&s;s till &s;he reached the foot of the &s;tairca&s;e. The fir&s;t beams of the ri&s;ing &s;un darting down it facilitated the a&s;cent. Matilda and the abbot ha&s;tened out of the &s;epulchre, clo&s;ed the door after them, and &s;oon regained the abbey's we&s;t|ern cloi&s;ter. No one met them, and they retired un|ob&s;erved to their re&s;pective cells.</P>
<P>The confu&s;ion of Ambro&s;io's mind now began to appea&s;e. He rejoiced in the fortunate i&s;&s;ue of his ad|venture: reflecting upon the virtues of the myrtle, he looked upon Antonia as already in his power, and waited with impatience for the approach of midnight.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ALL the re&s;earches of the marquis de las Ci&s;ter|nas proved in vain. Agnes was lo&s;t to him for|ever. De&s;pair produced &s;o violent an effect upon his con&s;titution, that the con&s;equence was a long and &s;e|vere illne&s;s. This prevented him from vi&s;iting El|vira, as he had intended; and &s;he being ignorant of the cau&s;e of his neglect, it gave her no trifling unea&s;i|ne&s;s. His &s;i&s;ter's death had prevented Lorenzo from communicating to his uncle his de&s;igns re&s;pecting An|tonia. The injunctions of her mother forbade his pre&s;enting him&s;elf to her without the duke's con&s;ent; and as &s;he heard no more of him or his propo&s;als, El|vira conjectured that he had either met with a better match, or had been commanded to give up all thoughts of her daughter. Every day made her more unea&s;y re&s;pecting Antonia's fate; yet while &s;he retained the abbot's protection, &s;he bore with fortitude the di&s;ap|pointment of her hopes with regard to Lorenzo and the marquis. That re&s;ource now failed her. She was convinced that Ambro&s;io had meditated her daughter's ruin; and when &s;he reflected that her death would leave Antonia friendle&s;s and unprotected in a world &s;o ba&s;e, &s;o perfidious and depraved, her heart &s;welled with the bitterne&s;s of apprehen&s;ion. At &s;uch times &s;he would &s;it for hours gazing upon the lovely girl, and &s;eeming to li&s;ten to her innocent prat|tle,
<PB N="65" REF="035729_0320_10065A33F3F1ED88">
while in reality her thoughts dwelt upon the &s;or|rows into which a moment would &s;uffice to plunge her. Then &s;he would cla&s;p her in her arms &s;uddenly, lean her head upon her daughter's bo&s;om, and bedew it with her tears.</P>
<P>An event was in preparation, which, had &s;he known it, would have relieved her from her inquietude. Lo|renzo now waited only for a favourable opportunity to inform the duke of his intended marriage: howe|ver, a circum&s;tance which occurred at this period obliged him to delay his explanation for a few days longer.</P>
<P>Don Raymond's malady &s;eemed to gain ground. Lorenzo was con&s;tantly at his bed-&s;ide, and treated him with a tenderne&s;s truly fraternal. Both the cau&s;e and effects of the di&s;order were highly afflicting to the brother of Agnes: yet Theodore's grief was &s;carcely le&s;s &s;incere. That amiable boy quitted not his ma&s;|ter for a moment, and put every means in practice to con&s;ole and alleviate his &s;ufferings. The marquis had conceived &s;o rooted an affection for his decea&s;ed mi&s;|tre&s;s, that it was evident to all that he never could &s;ur|vive her lo&s;s. Nothing could have prevented him from &s;inking under his grief, but the per&s;ua&s;ion of her being &s;till alive, and in need of his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Though convinced of its fal&s;ehood, his attendants encouraged him in a belief which formed his only comfort. He was a&s;&s;ured daily, that fre&s;h perqui&s;itions were mak|ing re&s;pecting Agnes: &s;tories were invented recount|ing the various attempts made to get admittance into the convent; and circum&s;tances were related, which, though they did not promi&s;e her ab&s;olute recovery, at
<PB N="66" REF="035729_0321_10065A71C25703A8">
lea&s;t were &s;ufficient to keep his hopes alive. The marquis con&s;tantly fell into the mo&s;t terrible exce&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion, when informed of the failure of the&s;e &s;uppo&s;|ed attempts. Still he would not credit that the &s;uc|ceeding ones would have the &s;ame fate, but flatter|ed him&s;elf that the next would prove more fortunate.</P>
<P>Theodore was the only one who exerted him&s;elf to realize his ma&s;ter's chimeras. He was eternally bu&s;i|ed in planning &s;chemes for entering the convent, or at lea&s;t of obtaining from the nuns &s;ome intelligence of Agnes. To execute the&s;e &s;chemes was the only in|ducement which could prevail on him to quit Don Raymond. He became a very Proteus, changing his &s;hape every day; but all his metamorpho&s;es were to very little purpo&s;e. He regularly, returned to the palace de las Ci&s;ternas without any intelligence to con|firm his ma&s;ter's hopes. One day he took it into his head to di&s;gui&s;e him&s;elf as a beggar; he put a patch over his left eye, took his guitar in hand, and po&s;ted him&s;elf at the gate of the convent.</P>
<P>"If Agnes is really confined in the convent," thought he, "and hears my voice, &s;he will recollect it, and po&s;&s;ibly may find means to let me know that &s;he is here."</P>
<P>With this idea he mingled with a crowd of beggars who a&s;&s;embled daily at the gate of St. Clare to receive &s;oup, which the nuns were accu&s;tomed to di&s;tribute at twelve o'clock. All were provided with jugs or bowls to carry it away; but as Theodore had no uten&s;il of this kind, he begged leave to eat his portion at the convent door. This was granted without diffi|culty. His &s;weet voice, and, in &s;pite of his patched
<PB N="67" REF="035729_0322_10065A384A5DEA58">
eye, his engaging countenance won the heart of the good old portere&s;s, who, aided by a lay &s;i&s;ter, was bu&s;i|ed in &s;erving to each his me&s;s. Theodore was bid to &s;tay till the others &s;hould depart, and promi&s;ed that his reque&s;t &s;hould then be granted. The youth de&s;ir|ed no better, &s;ince it was not to eat &s;oup that he pre|&s;ented him&s;elf at the convent. He thanked the por|tere&s;s for her permi&s;&s;ion, retired from the door, and, &s;eating him&s;elf upon a large &s;tone, amu&s;ed him&s;elf in tuning his guitar while the beggars were &s;erved.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the crowd was gone, Theodore was beckoned to the gate, and de&s;ired to come in. He obeyed with infinite readine&s;s, but affected great re|&s;pect at pa&s;&s;ing the hallowed thre&s;hold, and to be much daunted by the pre&s;ence of the reverend ladies. His feigned timidity flattered the vanity of the nuns, who endeavoured to rea&s;&s;ure him. The portere&s;s took him into her own little parlour: in the mean while the lay &s;i&s;ter went to the kitchen, and &s;oon returned with a double portion of &s;oup of better quality than what was given to the beggars. His ho&s;te&s;s added &s;ome fruits and confections from her own private &s;tore, and both encouraged the youth to dine heartily. To all the&s;e attentions he replied with much &s;eeming gratitude, and abundance of ble&s;&s;ings upon his benefactre&s;&s;es. While he ate, the nuns admired the delicacy of his features, the beauty of his hair, and the &s;weetne&s;s and grace which accompanied all his actions. They la|mented to each other in whi&s;pers, that &s;o charming a youth &s;hould be expo&s;ed to the &s;eductions of the world, and agreed that he would be a worthy pillar of the catholic church. They concluded their conference by re&s;olving, that heaven would be rendered a real &s;er|vice,
<PB N="68" REF="035729_0323_10065A734A72DDA0">
if they entreated the priore&s;s to intercede with Ambro&s;io for the beggar's admi&s;&s;ion into the order of Capuchins.</P>
<P>This being determined, the portere&s;s, who was a per&s;on of great influence in the convent, po&s;ted away in all ha&s;te to the domina's cell. Here &s;he made &s;o flaming a narrative of Theodore's merits, that the old lady grew curious to &s;ee him. Accordingly the porter|e&s;s was commi&s;&s;ioned to convey him to the parlour grate. In the interim, the &s;uppo&s;ed beggar was &s;ifting the lay &s;i&s;ter with re&s;pect to the fate of Agnes: her evidence only corroborated the domina's a&s;&s;ertions. She &s;aid, that Agnes had been taken ill on returning from confe&s;&s;ion, had never quitted her bed from that moment, and that &s;he had her&s;elf been pre&s;ent at the funeral. She even atte&s;ted having &s;een her dead body, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted with her own hands in adju&s;ting it upon the bier. This account di&s;couraged Theodore: yet, as he had pu&s;hed the adventure &s;o far, he re&s;olved to witne&s;s its conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The portere&s;s now returned, and ordered him to fol|low her. He obeyed, and was conducted into the parlour, where the lady priore&s;s was already po&s;ted at the grate. The nuns &s;urrounded her, who all flocked with eagerne&s;s to a &s;cene which promi&s;ed &s;ome di|ver&s;ion. Theodore &s;aluted them with profound re|&s;pect, and his pre&s;ence had the power to &s;mooth for a moment even the &s;tern brow of the &s;uperior. She a&s;k|ed &s;everal que&s;tions re&s;pecting his parents, his religion, and what had reduced him to a &s;tate of beggary. To the&s;e demands his an&s;wers were perfectly &s;atisfactory and perfectly fal&s;e. He was then a&s;ked his opinion of
<PB N="69" REF="035729_0324_10065A39D2522F80">
a mona&s;tic life. He replied in terms of high e&s;tima|tion and re&s;pect for it. Upon this the priore&s;s told him, that his obtaining an entrance into a religious or|der was not impo&s;&s;ible; that her recommendation would not permit his poverty to be an ob&s;tacle: and that, if &s;he found him de&s;erving it, he might depend in future upon her protection. Theodore a&s;&s;ured her, that to merit her favour would be his highe&s;t ambi|tion: and having ordered him to return next day, when &s;he would talk with him further, the domina quitted the parlour.</P>
<P>The nuns, whom re&s;pect for the &s;uperior had till then kept &s;ilent, now crowded all together to the grate, and a&s;&s;ailed the youth with a multitude of que&s;tions. He had already examined each with atten|tion. Alas! Agnes was not among&s;t them. The nuns heaped que&s;tion upon que&s;tion &s;o thickly, that it was &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible for him to reply. One a&s;ked where h&eacute; was born, &s;ince his accent declared him to be a foreigner; another wanted to know why he wore a patch upon his left eye: &s;i&s;ter Helena inquired wheth|er he had not a &s;i&s;ter like him, becau&s;e &s;he &s;hould like &s;uch a companion: and &s;i&s;ter Rachael was fully per|&s;uaded that the brother would be the plea&s;anter com|panion of the two. Theodore amu&s;ed him&s;elf with relating to the credulous nuns, for truths, all the &s;trange &s;tories which his imagination could invent. He related to them his &s;uppo&s;ed adventures, and pen|etrated every auditor with a&s;toni&s;hment, while he talked of giants, &s;avages, &s;hipwrecks, and i&s;lands in|habited</P>

<P>with many other circum&s;tances to the full as remark|able. He &s;aid that he was born in Terra Incognita, was educated at an Hottentot univer&s;ity, and had pa&s;&s;|ed two years among the Americans of Sile&s;ia.</P>
<P>"For what regards the lo&s;s of my eye," &s;aid he, "it was a ju&s;t puni&s;hment upon me for di&s;re&s;pect to the Virgin, when I made my &s;econd pilgrimage to Loretto. I &s;tood near the altar in the miraculous chapel: the monks were proceeding to array the &s;tatue in her be&s;t apparel. The pilgrims were order|ed to clo&s;e their eyes during this ceremony; but though by nature extremely religious, curio&s;ity was too pow|erful. At the moment . . . . . I &s;hall penetrate you with horror, reverend ladies, when I reveal my crime! . . . At the moment that the monks were changing her &s;hift, I ventured to open my left eye, and gave a little peep towards the &s;tatue. That look was my la&s;t! The glory which &s;urrounded the Virgin was too great to be &s;upported. I ha&s;tily &s;hut my &s;acrilegious eye, and never have been able to unclo&s;e it &s;ince!"</P>
<P>At the relation of this miracle the nuns all cro&s;&s;ed them&s;elves, and promi&s;ed to intercede with the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin for the recovery of his &s;ight. They expre&s;&s;ed their wonder at the extent of his travels, and at the &s;trange adventures which he had met with at &s;o ear|ly an age. They now remarked his guitar, and in|quired whether he was an adept in mu&s;ic. He re|plied with mode&s;ty, that it was not for him to decide upon his talents, but reque&s;ted permi&s;&s;ion to appeal to them as judges. This was granted without difficulty.</P>
<P>"But at lea&s;t," &s;aid the old portere&s;s, "take care not to &s;ing any thing profane."</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="035729_0326_10065A3B58F753B0">
"You may depend upon my di&s;cretion," replied Theodore; "you &s;hall hear how dangerous it is for young women to abandon them&s;elves to their pa&s;&s;ions, illu&s;trated by the adventure of a dam&s;el, who fell &s;ud|denly in love with an unknown knight."</P>
<P>"But is the adventure true?" inquired the porter|e&s;s.</P>
<P>"Every word of it. It happened in Denmark; and the heroine was thought &s;o beautiful, that &s;he was known by no other name than that of 'the lovely maid."</P>
<P>"In Denmark, &s;ay you?" mumbled an old nun: "are not the people all blacks in Denmark?"</P>
<P>"By no means, reverend lady; they are of a deli|cate pea green, with flame coloured hair and whi&s;k|ers."</P>
<P>"Mother of God! Pea-green?" exclaimed &s;i&s;ter Helena: "Oh! 'tis impo&s;&s;ible!"</P>
<P>"Impo&s;&s;ible!" &s;aid the portere&s;s, with a look of contempt and exultation: "Not at all: when I was a young woman, I remember &s;eeing &s;everal of them my&s;elf."</P>
<P>Theodore now put his in&s;trument in proper order. He had read the &s;tory of a king of England, who&s;e pri|&s;on was di&s;covered by a min&s;trel; and he hoped that the &s;ame &s;cheme would enable him to di&s;cover Agnes, &s;hould &s;he be in the convent. He cho&s;e a ballad, which &s;he had taught him her&s;elf in the ca&s;tle of Lin|denberg: &s;he might po&s;&s;ibly catch the &s;ound, and he
<PB N="72" REF="035729_0327_10065A78BACDF868">
hoped to hear her replying to &s;ome of the &s;tanzas. His guitar was now in tune, and he prepared to &s;trike it.</P>
<P>"But, before I begin," &s;aid he, "it is nece&s;&s;ary to inform you, ladies, that this &s;ame Denmark is terribly infe&s;ted by &s;orcerers, witches, and evil &s;pirits. Every element po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es its appropriate daemons. The woods are haunted by a malignant power, called 'The Erl, or Oak King:' he it is who blights the trees, &s;poils the harve&s;t, and commands the imps and goblins. He appears in the form of an old man of maje&s;tic figure, with a golden crown, and long white beard. His principal amu&s;ement is to entice young children from their parents; and as &s;oon as he gets them into his cave, tears them into a thou&s;and pieces. The rivers are governed by another fiend, called 'The Water King.' His province is to agitate the deep, occa&s;ion &s;hip|wrecks, and drag the drowning &s;ailors beneath the waves. He wears the appearance of a warrior, and employs him&s;elf in luring young virgins into his &s;nare: what he does with them when he catches them in the water, reverend ladies, I leave for you to im|agine. 'The Fire King' &s;eems to be a man all formed of flames: he rai&s;es the meteors and wandering lights which beguile travellers into ponds and mar&s;hes, and he directs the lightning where it may do mo&s;t mi&s;|chief. The la&s;t of the&s;e elementary daemons is called 'The Cloud King:' his figure is that of a beautiful youth, and he is di&s;tingui&s;hed by two large &s;able wings: though his out&s;ide is &s;o enchanting, he is not a bit better di&s;po&s;ed than the others. He is continu|ally employed in rai&s;ing &s;torms, tearing up fore&s;ts by
<PB N="73" REF="035729_0328_10065A3CEA1B8A80">
the roots, and blowing ca&s;tles and convents about the ears of their inhabitants. The fir&s;t has a daughter, who is queen of the elves and fairies: the &s;econd has a mother, who is a powerful enchantre&s;s. Neither of the&s;e ladies is worth more than the gentlemen. I do not remember to have heard any family a&s;&s;igned to the other two daemons, but at pre&s;ent I have no bu&s;ine&s;s with any of them except the fiend of the waters. He is the hero of my ballad; but I thought it nece&s;&s;ary, before I began, to give you &s;ome account of his pro|ceedings."</P>
<P>Theodore then played a &s;hort &s;ymphony; after which, &s;tretching his voice to its utmo&s;t extent, to fa|cilitate its reaching the ear of Agnes, he &s;ang the fol|lowing &s;tanzas:</P>

The nuns, to give him the greater inclination to keep his word, told him that he might always depend upon the convent for his meals, and each of them made him &s;ome little pre&s;ent. One gave him a box of &s;weetmeats; another, an agnus dei; &s;ome brought reliques of &s;aints, waxen images, and con&s;ecrated cro&s;&s;es; and others pre&s;ented him with pieces of tho&s;e works in which the religious excel, &s;uch as embroid|ery, artificial flowers, lace, and needle work. All the&s;e he was advi&s;ed to &s;ell, in order to put him&s;elf
<PB N="77" REF="035729_0332_10065A42BA47F3D0">
into better ca&s;e; and he was a&s;&s;ured that it would be ea&s;y to di&s;po&s;e of them, &s;ince the Spaniards hold the performances of the nuns in high e&s;timation. Having received the&s;e gifts with &s;eeming re&s;pect and gratitude,
<PB N="78" REF="035729_0333_10065A80D793B0B8">
he remarked, that, having no ba&s;ket, he knew not how to convey them away. Several of the nuns were ha&s;|tening in &s;earch of one, when they were &s;topped by the return of an elderly woman, whom Theodore had
<PB N="79" REF="035729_0334_10065A4445B41540">
not till then ob&s;erved. Her mild countenance, and re&s;pectable air prejudiced him immediately in her favour.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="035729_0335_10065A840F3EADF0">
"Hah!" &s;aid the portere&s;s, "here comes the mother St. Ur&s;ula with a ba&s;ket."</P>
<P>The nun approached the grate, and pre&s;ented the ba&s;ket to Theodore: it was of willow, lined with blue &s;atin, and upon the four &s;ides were painted &s;cenes from the legend of St. Genevieve.</P>
<P>"Here is my gift," &s;aid &s;he, as &s;he gave it into his hand: "Good youth de&s;pi&s;e it not. Though its value &s;eems in&s;ignificant, it has many hidden virtues."</P>
<P>She accompanied the&s;e words with an expre&s;&s;ive look. It was not lo&s;t upon Theodore. In receiving the pre&s;ent he drew as near the grate as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>"Agnes!" &s;he whi&s;pered in a voice &s;carcely intel|ligible.</P>
<P>Theodore, however, caught the &s;ound. He con|cluded that &s;ome my&s;tery was concealed in the ba&s;ket, and his heart beat with impatience and joy. At this moment the domina returned. Her air was gloomy and frowning, and &s;he looked if po&s;&s;ible more &s;tern than ever.</P>
<P>"Mother St. Ur&s;ula, I would &s;peak with you in private."</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="035729_0336_10065A45CD46ED00">
The nun changed colour, and was evidently di&s;con|certed.</P>
<P>"With me?" &s;he replied, in a faltering voice.</P>
<P>The domina motioned that &s;he mu&s;t follow her, and retired. The mother St. Ur&s;ula obeyed her. Soon after, the refectory bell ringing a &s;econd time, the nuns quitted the grate, and Theodore was left at liberty to carry off his prize. Delighted that at length he had obtained &s;ome intelligence for the mar|quis, he flew rather than ran till he reached the ho|tel de las Ci&s;ternas. In a few minutes he &s;tood by his ma&s;ter's bed with the ba&s;ket in his hand. Loren|zo was in the chamber, endeavouring to reconcile his friend to a misfortune which he felt him&s;elf but too &s;everely. Theodore related his adventure, and the hopes which had been created by the mother St. Ur|&s;ula's gift. The marquis &s;tarted from his pillow. That fire which &s;ince the death of Agnes had been ex|tingui&s;hed, now revived in his bo&s;om, and his eyes &s;parkled with eagerne&s;s of expectation. The emo|tions which Lorenzo's countenance betrayed were &s;carcely weaker, and he waited with inexpre&s;&s;ible im|patience for the &s;olution of this my&s;tery. Raymond caught the ba&s;ket from the hands of his page: he emp|tied the contents upon the bed, and examined <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with minute attention. He hoped that a letter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound at the bottom. Nothing of the kind appear|ed. The &s;earch was re&s;umed, and &s;till with no bet|ter &s;ucce&s;s. At length Don Raymond ob&s;erved that one corner of the blue &s;atin lining was unripped he tore it open ha&s;tily, and drew forth a &s;mall &s;crap of paper, neither folded or &s;ealed. It was addre&s;&s;ed to

the marquis de las Ci&s;ternas, and the contents were as follow:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>Having recogni&s;ed your page, I ventured to &s;end the&s;e few lines. Procure an order from the cardinal duke for &s;eizing my per&s;on, and that of the domina; but let it not be executed till Friday at midnight. It is the fe&s;tival of St. Clare: there will be a proce&s;&s;ion of nuns by torch light, and I &s;hall be among them. Beware, not to let your intention be known. Should a &s;yllable be dropped to excite the domina's &s;u&s;picions, you will never hear of me more. Be cautious, if you prize the memory of Agnes, and wi&s;h to puni&s;h her a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. I have that to tell, will freeze your blood with horror.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>No &s;ooner had the marquis read the note, than he fell back upon his pillow, deprived of &s;en&s;e or motion. The hope failed him which till now had &s;upported his exi&s;tence; and the&s;e lines convinced him but too po&s;i|tively that Agnes was indeed no more. Lorenzo felt this circum&s;tance le&s;s forcibly, &s;ince it had always been his idea that his &s;i&s;ter had peri&s;hed by unfair means. When he found by the mother St. Ur&s;ula's letter how true were his &s;u&s;picions, the confirmation excited no other &s;entiment in his bo&s;om than a wi&s;h to puni&s;h the murderers as they de&s;erved. It was no ea&s;y ta&s;k to recal the marquis to him&s;elf. As &s;oon as he recovered his &s;peech, he broke out into execrations again&s;t the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins of his beloved, and vowed to take upon them a &s;ignal vengeance. He continued to rave and torment him&s;elf with impotent pa&s;&s;ion, till his con&s;titution, enfeebled by grief and illne&s;s, could &s;upport it&s;elf no longer, and relap&s;ed into in&s;en&s;ibility. His melan|choly
<PB N="83" REF="035729_0338_10065A4A80E844F0">
&s;ituation &s;incerely affected Lorenzo, who would willingly have remained in the apartment of his friend: but other cares now demanded his pre&s;ence. It was nece&s;&s;ary to procure the order for &s;eizing the priore&s;s of St. Clare. For this purpo&s;e, having committed Raymond to the care of the be&s;t phy&s;icians in Madrid, he quitted the hotel de las Ci&s;ternas, and bent his cour&s;e towards the palace of the cardinal duke.</P>
<P>His di&s;appointment was exce&s;&s;ive, when he found that affairs of &s;tate had obliged the cardinal to &s;et out for a di&s;tant province. It wanted but five days to Friday: yet, by travelling day and night, he hoped to return in time for the pilgrimage of St. Clare. In this he &s;ucceeded. He found the cardinal duke, and repre&s;ented to him the &s;uppo&s;ed culpability of the prio|re&s;s, as al&s;o the violent effects which it had produced upon Don Raymond. He could have u&s;ed no argu|ment &s;o forcible as this la&s;t. Of all his nephews the marquis was the only one to whom the cardinal duke was &s;incerely attached: he perfectly doted upon him, and the priore&s;s could have committed no greater crime in his eyes, than to have endangered the life of the marquis. Con&s;equently, he granted the order of ar|re&s;t without difficulty. He al&s;o gave Lorenzo a letter to a principal officer of the Inqui&s;ition, de&s;iring him to &s;ee his mandate executed. Furni&s;hed with the&s;e papers, Medina ha&s;tened back to Madrid, which he reached on the Friday a few hours before dark. He found the marquis &s;omewhat ea&s;ier, but &s;o weak and exhau&s;ted, that without great exertion he could neither &s;peak nor move. Having pa&s;&s;ed an hour by his bed &s;ide, Lorenzo left him to communicate his de&s;ign to his uncle, as al&s;o to give Don Ramirez de Mello the
<PB N="84" REF="035729_0339_10065A871C2B0F40">
cardinal's letter. The fir&s;t was petrified with horror, when he learned the fate of his unhappy niece. He encouraged Lorenzo to puni&s;h her a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, and en|gaged to accompany him at night to St. Clare's con|vent. Don Ramirez promi&s;ed his firme&s;t &s;upport, and &s;elected a band of tru&s;ty archers to prevent oppo|&s;ition on the part of the populace.</P>
<P>But while Lorenzo was anxious to unma&s;k one re|ligious hypocrite, he was uncon&s;cious of the &s;orrows prepared for him by another. Aided by Matilda's in|fernal agents, Ambro&s;io had re&s;olved upon the inno|cent Antonia's ruin. The moment de&s;tined to be &s;o fa|tal to her arrived. She had taken leave of her mother for the night. As &s;he ki&s;&s;ed her, &s;he felt an unu&s;ual de&s;pondency infu&s;e it&s;elf into her bo&s;om. She left her, and returned to her in&s;tantly, threw her&s;elf into her maternal arms, and bathed her cheek with tears. She felt unea&s;y at quitting her, and a &s;ecret pre&s;enti|ment a&s;&s;ured her that never mu&s;t they meet again. Elvira ob&s;erved, and tried to laugh her out of this childi&s;h prejudice. She chid her mildly for encour|aging &s;uch ungrounded &s;adne&s;s, and warned her how dangerous it was to give way to &s;uch ideas.</P>
<P>To all her remon&s;trances &s;he received no other an&s;wer than&mdash;</P>
<P>"Mother! Dear mother! oh! would to God it were morning!"</P>
<P>Elvira, who&s;e inquietude re&s;pecting her daughter was a great ob&s;tacle to her perfect ree&s;tabli&s;hment, was &s;till labouring under the effects of her late &s;evere illne&s;s. She was this evening more than u&s;ually in|di&s;po&s;ed,
<PB N="85" REF="035729_0340_10065A4C08C072B0">
and retired to bed before her accu&s;tomed hour. Antonia withdrew from her mother's chamber with regret, and, till the door clo&s;ed, kept her eyes fix|ed upon her with melancholy expre&s;&s;ion. She retired to her own apartment: her heart was filled with bit|terne&s;s. It &s;eemed to her that all her pro&s;pects were bla&s;ted, and the world contained nothing for which it was worth exi&s;ting. She &s;unk into a chair, reclined her head upon her arm, and gazed upon the floor with a vacant &s;tare, while the mo&s;t gloomy images floated before her fancy. She was &s;till in this &s;tate of in&s;en&s;i|bility, when &s;he was di&s;turbed by hearing a &s;train of &s;oft mu&s;ic breathed beneath her window. She ro&s;e, drew near the ca&s;ement, and opened it to hear it more di&s;tinctly. Having thrown her veil over her face, &s;he ventured to look out. By the light of the moon &s;he perceived &s;everal men below with guitars and lutes in their hands; and at a little di&s;tance from them &s;tood another wrapped in his cloak, who&s;e &s;tature and appearance bore a &s;trong re&s;emblance to Lorenzo's. She was not deceived in this conjecture. It was indeed Lorenzo him&s;elf, who, bound by his word not to pre&s;ent him|&s;elf to Antonia without his uncle's con&s;ent, endeavour|ed, by occa&s;ional &s;erenades, to convince his mi&s;tre&s;s that his attachment &s;till exi&s;ted. His &s;tratagem had not the de&s;ired effect. Antonia was far from &s;uppo&s;|ing that this nightly mu&s;ic was intended as a compli|ment to her. She was too mode&s;t to think her&s;elf worthy &s;uch attentions; and concluding them to be addre&s;&s;ed to &s;ome neighbouring lady, &s;he grieved to find that they were offered by Lorenzo.</P>
<P>The air which was played was plaintive and melo|dious. It accorded with the &s;tate of Antonia's mind,
<PB N="86" REF="035729_0341_10065A88D10D2490">
and &s;he li&s;tened with plea&s;ure. After a &s;ymphony of &s;ome length, it was &s;ucceeded by the &s;ound of voices, and Antonia di&s;tingui&s;hed the following words:</P>
<LG>
<HEAD>SERENADE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<HEAD>CHORUS.</HEAD>
<L>OH! breathe in gentle &s;train, my lyre!</L>
<L>'Tis here that beauty loves to re&s;t:</L>

</LG>
</LG>
<P>The mu&s;ic cea&s;ed: the performers di&s;per&s;ed, and &s;ilence prevailed through the &s;treet. Antonia quitted the window with regret. She, as u&s;ual, recommend|ed her&s;elf to the protection of St. Ro&s;olia, &s;aid her accu&s;tomed prayers, and retired to bed. Sleep was not long ab&s;ent, and his pre&s;ence relieved her from her terrors and inquietude.</P>
<P>It was almo&s;t two o'clock before the monk ven|tured to bend his &s;teps towards Antonia's dwelling. It has been already mentioned, that the abbey was at no great di&s;tance from the &s;trada di San Iago. He reached the hou&s;e unob&s;erved. Here he &s;topped and he&s;itated for a moment. He reflected on the enormity of the crime, the con&s;equences of a di&s;covery, and the probability after what had pa&s;&s;ed, of Elvira's &s;u&s;pect|ing him to be the culprit. On the others hand it was &s;ugge&s;ted, that &s;he could do no more than &s;u&s;pect; that no proofs of his guilt could be produced; and finally, he believed tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> his fame was too firmly e&s;|tabli&s;hed to be &s;haken by the un&s;upported accu&s;ations of two unknown women. This latter argument was perfectly fal&s;e. He knew not how uncertain is the air of popular applau&s;e, and that a moment &s;uffices to make him to-day, the dete&s;tation of the world, who ye&s;terday was its idol. The re&s;ult of the monk's de|liberations was, that he &s;hould proceed in his enter|pri&s;e. He a&s;cended the &s;teps leading to the hou&s;e. No &s;ooner did he touch the door with the &s;ilver myr|tle, than it flew open, and pre&s;ented him with a free
<PB N="88" REF="035729_0343_10065A8BABF8F928">
pa&s;&s;age. He entered, and the door clo&s;ed after him of its own accord.</P>
<P>Guided by the moon beams, he proceeded up the &s;tairca&s;e with &s;low and cautious &s;teps. He looked round him every moment with apprehen&s;ion and anx|iety. He &s;aw a &s;py in every &s;hadow, and heard a voice in every murmur of the night breeze. Con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the guilty bu&s;ine&s;s on which he was em|ployed appalled his heart, and rendered it more timid than a woman's. Yet &s;till he proceeded. He reach|ed the door of Antonia's chamber. He &s;topped and li&s;tened. All was hu&s;hed within. The total &s;ilence per&s;uaded him that his intended victim was retired to re&s;t, and he ventured to lift up the latch. The door was fa&s;tened, and re&s;i&s;ted his efforts. But no &s;ooner was it touched by the tali&s;man than the bolt flew back. The intruder &s;tepped on, and found him&s;elf in the chamber, where &s;lept the innocent girl, uncon&s;cious how dangerous a vi&s;itor was drawing near her couch. The door clo&s;ed after him, and the bolt &s;hot again into its fa&s;tening.</P>
<P>Ambro&s;io advanced with precaution. He took care that not a board &s;hould creak under his foot, and held in his breath as he approached the bed. His fir&s;t at|tention was to perform the magic ceremony as Matilda had charged him: he breathed thrice upon the &s;ilver myrtle, pronounced over it Antonia's name, and laid it upon her pillow. The effects which it had already produced, permitted not his doubting its &s;ucce&s;s in prolonging the &s;lumbers of his devoted mi&s;tre&s;s; and no &s;ooner was the enchantment performed, than he con&s;idered nor to be ab&s;olutely in his power. He
<PB N="89" REF="035729_0344_10065A4F706D3780">
now ventured to ca&s;t a glance upon the &s;leeping beauty. A &s;ingle lamp burning before the &s;tatue of St. Ro&s;o|lia, &s;hed a faint light through the room, and permitted him to examine all the charms of the lovely object be|fore him. She lay with her cheek reclining upon one ivory arm; the other re&s;ted on the &s;ide of the bed with graceful indolence. A few tre&s;&s;es of her hair had e&s;|caped from beneath the mu&s;lin which confined the re&s;t, and fell carele&s;sly over her bo&s;om, as it heaved with &s;low and regular &s;u&s;piration. The warm air had &s;pread her cheek with higher colour than u&s;ual. A &s;mile inexpre&s;&s;ibly &s;weet played round her ripe and coral lips, from which every now and then e&s;caped a gentle &s;igh, or an half pronounced &s;entence. An air of enchanting innocence and candour was &s;pread over every feature. But the mode&s;ty vi&s;ible in her whole appearance, in&s;tead of per&s;uading him to renounce them, &s;erved only to confirm the monk in his de&s;igns.</P>
<P>He remained for &s;ome moments lo&s;t in motionle&s;s admiration! Her mouth half open &s;eemed to &s;olicit a ki&s;s: he bent over her: he joined his lips to hers, and drew in the fragrance of her breath with rapture.</P>
<P>"Gracious God!" at that moment exclaimed a voice behind him: "Am I not deceived? Is not this an illu&s;ion?"</P>
<P>Terror, confu&s;ion, and di&s;appointment accompanied the&s;e words, as they &s;truck Ambro&s;io's hearing. He &s;tarted, and turned towards the voice. Elvira &s;tood at the door of the chamber, and regarded the monk with looks of &s;urpri&s;e and dete&s;tation.</P>
<P>A frightful dream had repre&s;ented to her Antonia
<PB N="90" REF="035729_0345_10065A8EC5C4E9D8">
on the verge of a precipice. She &s;aw her trembling on the brink: every moment &s;eemed to threaten her fall, and &s;he heard her exclaim with &s;hrieks, "Save me, mother! &s;ave me!&mdash;Yet a moment, and it will be too late." Elvira woke in terror. The vi&s;ion had made too &s;trong an impre&s;&s;ion upon her mind, to per|mit her re&s;ting till a&s;&s;ured of her daughter's &s;afety. She ha&s;tily &s;tarted from her bed, threw on a loo&s;e night gown, and, pa&s;&s;ing through the clo&s;et in which &s;lept the waiting woman, reached Antonia's chamber in time to re&s;cue her from the betrayer's gra&s;p.</P>
<P>His &s;hame and her amazement &s;eemed to have pet|rified into &s;tatues both Elvira and the monk. They remained gazing upon each other in &s;ilence. The lady was the fir&s;t to recover her&s;elf.</P>
<P>"It is no dream," &s;he cried: "it is really Ambro|&s;io who &s;tands before me. It is the man whom Ma|drid e&s;teems a &s;aint, that I find at this late hour near the couch of my unhappy child. Mon&s;ter of hypoc|ri&s;y! I already &s;u&s;pected your de&s;igns, but forebore your accu&s;ation in pity to human frailty. Silence would now be criminal. The whole city &s;hall be in|formed of your infamy. I will unma&s;k you, villain, and convince the church what a viper &s;he cheri&s;hes in her bo&s;om."</P>
<P>Pale and confu&s;ed, the baffled culprit &s;tood trem|bling before her. He would fain have extenuated his offence, but could find no apology for his conduct. He could produce nothing but broken &s;entences, and excu&s;es which contradicted each other. Elvira was too ju&s;tly incen&s;ed to grant the pardon which he re|que&s;ted. She prote&s;ted that &s;he would rai&s;e the neigh|bourhood,
<PB N="91" REF="035729_0346_10065ACA3A9880E8">
and make him an example to all future hypocrites. Then ha&s;tening to the bed, &s;he called to Antonia to wake; and finding that her voice had no effect, &s;he took her arm, and rai&s;ed her forcibly from the pillow. The charm operated too powerfully. Antonia remained in&s;en&s;ible; and, on being relea&s;ed by her mother, &s;unk back upon the pillow.</P>
<P>"This &s;lumber cannot be natural," cried the amaz|ed Elvira, who&s;e indignation increa&s;ed with every mo|ment: "&s;ome my&s;tery is concealed in it. But trem|ble, hypocrite! All your villainy &s;hall &s;oon be unrav|elled. Help! help!" &s;he exclaimed aloud: "With|in there! Flora! Flora!"</P>
<P>"Hear me for one moment, lady!" cried the monk, re&s;tored to him&s;elf by the urgency of the dan|ger: by all that is &s;acred and holy, I &s;wear that your daughter's honor is &s;till unviolated. Forgive my tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion! Spare me the &s;hame of a di&s;covery, and per|mit me to regain the abbey undi&s;turbed. Grant me this reque&s;t in mercy! I promi&s;e not only that Anto|nia &s;hall be &s;ecure from me in future, but that the re&s;t of my life &s;hall prove&mdash;"</P>
<P>Elvira interrupted him abruptly.</P>
<P>"Antonia &s;ecure from you? <HI>I</HI> will &s;ecure her. You &s;hall betray no longer the confidence of parents. Your iniquity &s;hall be unveiled to the public eye. All Madrid &s;hall &s;hudder at your perfidy and hypoc|ri&s;y. What ho! there! Flora! Flora! I &s;ay."</P>
<P>While &s;he &s;poke thus, the remembrance of Agnes &s;truck upon his mind. Thus had &s;he &s;ued to him for mercy, and thus had he refu&s;ed her prayer! It was
<PB N="92" REF="035729_0347_10065A904D47CF90">
now his turn to &s;uffer, and he could not but acknow|ledge that his puni&s;hment was ju&s;t. In the mean while Elvira continued to call Flora to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but her voice was &s;o choaked with pa&s;&s;ion, that the &s;ervant, who was buried in profound &s;lumber, was in|&s;en&s;ible to all her cries: Elvira dared not go towards the clo&s;et in which Flora &s;lept, le&s;t the monk &s;hould take that opportunity to e&s;cape. Such indeed was his intention: he tru&s;ted that, could he reach the abbey unob&s;erved by any other than Elvira, her &s;ingle te&s;ti|mony would not &s;uffice to ruin a reputation &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed as his was in Madrid. With this idea he ha&s;tened towards the door. Elvira was aware of his de&s;ign: &s;he followed him, and, ere he could draw back the bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t, &s;eized him by the arm, and detained him.</P>
<P>"Attempt not to fly!" &s;aid &s;he: "you quit not this room without witne&s;&s;es of your guilt."</P>
<P>Ambro&s;io &s;truggled in vain to di&s;engage him&s;elf. Elvira quitted not her hold, but redoubled her cries for &s;uccour. The friar's danger grew more urgent. He expected every moment to hear people a&s;&s;embling at her voice; and, worked up to madne&s;s by the ap|proach of ruin, he adopted a re&s;olution equally de&s;per|ate and &s;avage. Turning round &s;uddenly, with one hand he gra&s;ped Elvira's throat &s;o as to prevent her continuing her clamour, and with the other da&s;hing her violently upon the ground, he dragged her towards the bed. Confu&s;ed by this unexpected attack, &s;he &s;carce|ly had power to &s;trive at forcing her&s;elf from his gra&s;p: while the monk, &s;natching the pillow from beneath her daughter's head, covering with it Elvira's face, and pre&s;&s;ing his knee upon her &s;tomach with all

his &s;trength, endeavoured to put an end to her exi&s;t|ence. He &s;ucceeded but too well. Her natural &s;trength increa&s;ed by the exce&s;s of angui&s;h, long did the &s;ufferer &s;truggle to di&s;engage her&s;elf but in vai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. The monk continued to kneel upon her brea&s;t, wit|ne&s;&s;ed without mercy the convul&s;ive trembling of her limbs beneath him, and &s;u&s;tained with inhuman firm|ne&s;s the &s;pectacle of her agonies, when &s;oul and body were on the point of &s;eparating. Tho&s;e agonies at length were over. She cea&s;ed to &s;truggle for life. The monk took off the pillow, and gazed upon her. Her face was covered with a frightful blackne&s;s: her limbs moved no more: the blood was chilled in her veins: her heart had forgotten to beat; and her hands were &s;tiff and frozen. Ambro&s;io beheld before him that once noble and maje&s;tic form, now become a cor&s;e, cold, &s;en&s;ele&s;s, and di&s;gu&s;ting.</P>
<P>This horrible act was no &s;ooner perpetrated, than the friar beheld the enormity of his crime. A cold dew flowed over his limbs: his eyes clo&s;ed: he &s;tag|gered to a chair, and &s;unk into it almo&s;t as lifele&s;s as the unfortunate who lay extended at his feet. From this &s;tate he was rou&s;ed by the nece&s;&s;ity of flight, and the danger of being found in Antonia's apartment. He had no de&s;ire to profit by the execution of his crime. Antonia now appeared to him an object of di&s;gu&s;t. A deadly cold had u&s;urped the place of that warmth which glowed in his bo&s;om. No ideas offered them|&s;elves to his mind but tho&s;e of death and guilt, of pre&s;ent &s;hame and future puni&s;hment. Agitated by remor&s;e and fear, he prepared for flight: yet his ter|rors did not &s;o completely ma&s;ter his recollection, as to prevent his taking the precautions nece&s;&s;ary for his
<PB N="94" REF="035729_0349_10065A91D62743C0">
&s;afety. He replaced the pillow upon the bed, and, with the fatal tali&s;man in his hand, bent his un&s;teady &s;teps towards the door. Bewildered by fear, he fan|cied that his flight was oppo&s;ed by legions of phantoms. Wherever he turned, the disfigured cor&s;e &s;eemed to lie in his pa&s;&s;age, and it was long before he &s;ucceeded in reaching the door. The enchanted myrtle produced its former effect. The door opened, and he ha&s;tened down the &s;tairca&s;e. He entered the abbey unob&s;erved; and having &s;hut him&s;elf into his cell, he abandoned his &s;oul to the tortures of unavailing remor&s;e, and ter|rors of impending detection.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AMBROSIO &s;huddered at him&s;elf when he re|flected on his rapid advances in iniquity. The enormous crime which he had ju&s;t committed, filled him with real horror. The murdered Elvira was con|tinually before his eyes, and his guilt was already pun|i&s;hed by the agonies of his con&s;cience. Time, how|ever, con&s;iderably weakened the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions: one day pa&s;&s;ed away; another followed it, and &s;till not the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion was thrown upon him. Impunity reconciled him to his guilt. He began to re&s;ume his &s;pirits; and as his fears of detection died away, he paid le&s;s attention to the reproaches of remor&s;e. Ma|tilda exerted her&s;elf to quiet his alarms. At the fir&s;t intelligence of Elvira's death &s;he &s;eemed greatly affect|ed, and joined the monk in deploring the unhappy cata&s;trophe of his adventure; but when &s;he found his agitation to be &s;omewhat calmed, and him&s;elf better di&s;po&s;ed to li&s;ten to her arguments, &s;he proceeded to mention his offence in milder terms, and convince him that he was not &s;o highly culpable as he appeared to con&s;ider him&s;elf. She repre&s;ented, that he had only availed him&s;elf of the rights which nature allows to every one, tho&s;e of &s;elf pre&s;ervation: that either El|vira or him&s;elf mu&s;t have peri&s;hed; and that her in|flexibility
<PB N="96" REF="035729_0351_10065A9635958F50">
and re&s;olution to ruin him had de&s;ervedly marked her out for the victim. She next &s;tated, that as he had before rendered him&s;elf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;pected to Elvira, it was a fortunate event for him that her lips were clo&s;ed by death; &s;ince, without this la&s;t adventure, her &s;u&s;picions, if made public, might have produced very di&s;agreeable con&s;equences. He had therefore freed him&s;elf from an enemy, to whom the errors of his conduct were &s;ufficiently known to make her dan|gerous, and who was the greate&s;t ob&s;tacle to his de|&s;igns upon Antonia. Tho&s;e de&s;igns &s;he encouraged him not to abandon. She a&s;&s;ured him that, no lon|ger protected by her mother's watchful eye, the daugh|ter would fall an ea&s;y conque&s;t; and by prai&s;ing and enumerating Antonia's charms &s;he &s;trove to rekindle the de&s;ires of the monk. In this endeavour &s;he &s;uc|ceeded but too well.</P>
<P>As if the crimes into which his pa&s;&s;ion had &s;educed him had only increa&s;ed its violence, he was now bent more earne&s;tly than ever on procuring its gratification. The &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s in concealing his pre&s;ent guilt, he tru&s;ted, would attend his future. He was deaf to the murmurs of con&s;cience, and re&s;olved to &s;atisfy his de&s;ires at any price. He waited only for an opportu|nity of repeating his former enterpri&s;e; but to pro|cure that opportunity by the &s;ame means was now im|practicable. In the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of de&s;pair he had da&s;hed the enchanted myrtle into a thou&s;and pieces. Matilda told him plainly, that he mu&s;t expect no fur|ther a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the infernal powers, unle&s;s he was willing to &s;ub&s;cribe to their e&s;tabli&s;hed conditions. This Ambro&s;io was determined not to do. He per|&s;uaded him&s;elf that, however great might be his ini|quity,
<PB N="97" REF="035729_0352_10065AD1F46D2868">
&s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> as he pre&s;erve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> his claim to &s;alvation, he need not de&s;pair of pardon. He therefore re&s;olutely refu&s;ed to enter into any bond or compact with the fiends; and Matilda, finding him ob&s;tinate upon this point, forebore to pre&s;s him further. She exerted her invention to di&s;cover &s;ome means of putting Antonia into the abbot's power: nor was it long before that means pre&s;ented it&s;elf.</P>
<P>While her ruin was thus meditating, the unhappy girl her&s;elf &s;uffered &s;everely from the lo&s;s of her moth|er. Every morning on waking, it was her fir&s;t care to ha&s;ten to Elvira's chamber. On that which fol|lowed Ambro&s;io's fatal vi&s;it, &s;he woke later than was her u&s;ual cu&s;tom: of this &s;he was convinced by the abbey chimes. She &s;tarted from her bed, threw on a few loo&s;e garments ha&s;tily, and was &s;peeding to in|quire how her mother had pa&s;&s;ed the night, when her foot &s;truck again&s;t &s;omething which lay in her pa&s;|&s;age. She looked down. What was her horror at recogni&s;ing Elvira's livid cor&s;e! She uttered a loud &s;hriek, and threw her&s;elf upon the floor. She cla&s;ped the inanimate form to her bo&s;om, felt that it was dead cold, and, with a movement of di&s;gu&s;t, of which &s;he was not mi&s;tre&s;s, let it fall again from her arms. The cry had alarmed Flora, who ha&s;tened to her a&s;|&s;i&s;tance. The &s;ight which &s;he beheld penetrated her with horror; but her alarm was more audible than Antonia's. She made the hou&s;e ring with her lamen|tations, while her mi&s;tre&s;s, almo&s;t &s;uffocated with grief, could only mark her di&s;tre&s;s by &s;obs and groans. Flora's &s;hrieks &s;oon reached the ears of the ho&s;te&s;s. who&s;e terror and &s;urpri&s;e were exce&s;&s;ive on learning
<PB N="98" REF="035729_0353_10065A97C4292F80">
the cau&s;e of this di&s;turbance. A phy&s;ician was imme|diately &s;ent for; but, on the fir&s;t moment of beholding the cor&s;e, he declared that Elvira's recovery was beyond the power of art. He proceeded therefore to give his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to Antonia, who by this time was truly in need of it. She was conveyed to bed, while the land|lady bu&s;ied her&s;elf in giving orders for Elvira's burial. Dame Jacintha was a plain good kind of woman, charitable, generous, and devout; but her intellects were weak, and &s;he was a mi&s;erable &s;lave to fear and &s;uper&s;tition. She &s;huddered at the idea of pa&s;&s;ing the night in the &s;ame hou&s;e with a dead body. She was per&s;uaded that Elvira's gho&s;t would appear to her, and no le&s;s certain that &s;uch a vi&s;it would kill her with fright. From this per&s;ua&s;ion, &s;he re&s;olved to pa&s;s the night at a neighbour's, and in&s;i&s;ted that the funeral &s;hould take place the next day. St. Clare's cemetery being the neare&s;t, it was determined that Elvira &s;hould be buried there. Dame Jacintha engaged to defray every expen&s;e attending the burial. She knew not in what circum&s;tances Antonia was left; but, from the &s;paring manner in which the family had lived, &s;he concluded them to be indifferent: con&s;equently, &s;he entertained very little hope of ever being recom|pen&s;ed. But this con&s;ideration prevented her not from taking care that the interment was performed with decency, and from &s;hewing the unfortunate An|tonia all po&s;&s;ible re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Nobody dies of mere grief; of this Antonia was an in&s;tance. Aided by her youth and healthy con&s;titu|tion, &s;he &s;hook off the malady which her mother's death had occa&s;ioned; but it was not &s;o ea&s;y to re|move the di&s;ea&s;e of her mind. Her eyes were con|&s;tantly
<PB N="99" REF="035729_0354_10065AD39AB40B58">
filled with tears; every trifle affected her, and &s;he evidently nouri&s;hed in her bo&s;om a profound and rooted melancholy. The &s;lighte&s;t mention of Elvira, the mo&s;t trivial circum&s;tance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that beloved parent to her memory, was &s;ufficient to throw her into &s;erious agitation. How much would her grief have been increa&s;ed, had &s;he known the agonies which ter|minated her mother's exi&s;tence! But of this no one entertained the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion. Elvira was &s;ubject to &s;trong convul&s;ions: it was &s;uppo&s;ed that, aware of their approach, &s;he had dragged her&s;elf to her daughter's chamber, in hopes of a&s;&s;i&s;tance: that a &s;udden acce&s;s of her fits had &s;eized her, too violent to be re&s;i&s;ted by her already enfeebled &s;tate of health; and that &s;he had expired ere &s;he had time to reach the medicine which generally relieved her, and which &s;tood upon a &s;helf in Antonia's room. This idea was firmly credited by the few people who intere&s;ted them&s;elves about El|vira. Her death was e&s;teemed a natural event, and &s;oon forgotten by all, &s;ave by her who had too much rea&s;on to deplore her lo&s;s.</P>
<P>In truth, Antonia's &s;ituation was &s;ufficiently em|barra&s;&s;ing and unplea&s;ant. She was alone, in the mid&s;t of a di&s;&s;ipated and expen&s;ive city; &s;he was ill provided with money and wor&s;e with friends. Her aunt Leonella was &s;till at Cordova, and &s;he knew not her direction. Of the marquis de las Ci&s;ternas &s;he heard no news. As to Lorenzo, &s;he had long given up the idea of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing any intere&s;t in his bo&s;om. She knew not to whom &s;he could addre&s;s her&s;elf in her pre&s;ent dilemma. She wi&s;hed to con&s;ult Ambro|&s;io, but &s;he remembered her mother's injunctions to
<PB N="100" REF="035729_0355_10065A99B1078380">
&s;hun him as much as po&s;&s;ible; and the la&s;t conver&s;a|tion which Elvira had held with her upon the &s;ubject, had given her &s;ufficient lights re&s;pecting his de&s;igns, to put her upon her guard again&s;t him in future. Still all her mother's warnings could not make her change her good opinion of the friar. She continued to feel that his friend&s;hip and &s;ociety were requi&s;ite to her happine&s;s: &s;he looked upon his failings with a partial eye, and could not per&s;uade her&s;elf that he really had intended her ruin. However, Elvira had po&s;itively commanded her to drop his acquaintance, and &s;he had too much re&s;pect for her orders to di&s;obey them.</P>
<P>At length &s;he re&s;olved to addre&s;s her&s;elf for advice and protection to the marquis de las Ci&s;ternas, as be|ing her neare&s;t relation. She wrote to him, briefly &s;tating her de&s;olate &s;ituation: &s;he be&s;ought him to compa&s;&s;ionate his brother's child, to continue to her Elvira's pen&s;ion, and to authorize her retiring to his old ca&s;tle in Murcia, which till now had been her retreat. Having &s;ealed her letter, &s;he gave it to the tru&s;ty Flo|ra, who immediately &s;et out to execute her commi&s;|&s;ion. But Antonia was born under an unlucky &s;tar. Had &s;he made her application to the marquis but one day &s;ooner, received as his neice, and placed at the head of his family, &s;he would have e&s;caped all the misfortunes with which &s;he was now threatened. Raymond had always intended to execute this plan: but fir&s;t, his hopes of making the propo&s;al to Elvira through the lips of Agnes, and afterwards his di&s;ap|pointment at lo&s;ing his intended bride, as well as the &s;evere illne&s;s which for &s;ome time had confined him to his bed, made him defer from day to day the giv|ing
<PB N="101" REF="035729_0356_10065AD658ED8010">
an a&s;ylum in his hou&s;e to his brother's widow. He had commi&s;&s;ioned Lorenzo to &s;upply her liberally with money. But Elvira, unwilling to receive obli|gations from that nobleman, had a&s;&s;ured him that &s;he needed no immediate pecuniary a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Con&s;e|quently the marquis did not imagine that a trifling de|lay on his part would create any embarra&s;&s;ment; and the di&s;tre&s;s and agitation of his mind might well ex|cu&s;e his negligence.</P>
<P>Had he been informed that Elvira's death had left her daughter friendle&s;s and unprotected, he would doubtle&s;s have taken &s;uch mea&s;ures as would have en|&s;ured her from every danger. But Antonia was not de&s;tined to be &s;o fortunate. The day on which &s;he &s;ent her letter to the palace de las Ci&s;ternas, was that following Lorenzo's departure from Madrid. The marquis was in the fir&s;t paroxy&s;ms of de&s;pair at the conviction that Agnes was indeed no more: he was delirious; and his life being in danger; no one was &s;uffered to approach him. Flora was informed that he was incapable of attending to letters, and that probably a few hours would decide his fate. With this un&s;atisfactory an&s;wer &s;he was obliged to return to her mi&s;tre&s;s, who now found her&s;elf plunged into greater difficulties than ever.</P>
<P>Flora and Dame Jacintha exerted them&s;elves to con|&s;ole her. The latter begged her to make her&s;elf ea&s;y, for that as long as &s;he cho&s;e to &s;tay with her &s;he would treat her like her own child. Antonia, finding that the good woman had taken a real affection for her, was &s;omewhat comforted by thinking that &s;he had at lea&s;t one friend in the world. A letter was brought
<PB N="102" REF="035729_0357_10065A9B39DC6890">
to her, directed to Elvira. She recogni&s;ed Leonella's writing, and, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">pening it with joy, found a detailed ac|count of her aunt's adventures at Cordova. She in|formed her &s;i&s;ter that &s;he had recovered her legacy, had lo&s;t her heart, and had received in exchange that of the mo&s;t amiable of apothecaries, pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, and to come. She added, that &s;he &s;hould be at Madrid on the Tue&s;day night, and meant to have the plea&s;ure of pre&s;enting her caro &s;po&s;o in form. Though her nup|tials were far from plea&s;ing Antonia, Leonella's &s;peedy return gave her niece much delight. She re|joiced in thinking that &s;he &s;hould once more be un|der a relation's care. She could not but judge it to be highly improper for a young woman to be living among ab&s;olute &s;trangers, with no one to regulate her conduct, or protect her from the in&s;ults to which in her defencele&s;s &s;ituation &s;he was expo&s;ed. She there|fore looked forward with impatience to the Tue&s;day night.</P>
<P>It arrived. Antonia li&s;tened anxiou&s;ly to the car|riages as they rolled along the &s;treet. None of them &s;topped, and it grew late without Leonella's appear|ing. Still Antonia re&s;olved to &s;it up till her aunt's ar|rival: and, in &s;pite of all her remon&s;trances, dame Jacintha and Flora in&s;i&s;ted on doing the &s;ame. The hours pa&s;&s;ed on &s;low and tediou&s;ly. Lorenzo's de|parture from Madrid had put a &s;top to the nightly &s;er|enades: &s;he hoped in vain to hear the u&s;ual &s;ound of guitars beneath her window. She took up her own and &s;truck a few chords; but mu&s;ic that evening had lo&s;t its charms for her, and &s;he &s;oon replaced the in|&s;trument in its ca&s;e. She &s;eated her&s;elf at her em|broidery frame, but nothing went right: the &s;ilks
<PB N="103" REF="035729_0358_10065AD93B9649A8">
were mi&s;&s;ing, the thread &s;napped every moment, and the needles were &s;o expert at falling that they &s;eemed to be animated. At length a flake of wax fell from the taper which &s;tood near her upon a favourite wreath of violets: this completely di&s;compo&s;ed her; &s;he threw down her needle and quitted the frame. It was decreed that for that night nothing &s;hould have the power of amu&s;ing her, &s;he was the prey of ennui, and employed her&s;elf in making fruitle&s;s wi&s;hes for the arrival of her aunt.</P>
<P>As &s;he walked with a li&s;tle&s;s air up and down the chamber, the door conducting to that which had been her mother's caught her eye. She remembered that Elvira's little library was arranged there, and thought that &s;he might po&s;&s;ibly find in it &s;ome book to amu&s;e her till Leonella &s;hould arrive. Accordingly &s;he took her taper from the table, pa&s;&s;ed through the little clo&s;et, and entered the adjoining apartment. As &s;he looked around her, the &s;ight of this room brought to her recollection a thou&s;and painful ideas. It was the fir&s;t time of her entering it &s;ince her mother's death. The total &s;ilence prevailing through the chamber, the bed de&s;poiled of its furniture, the cheerle&s;s hearth where &s;tood an extingui&s;hed lamp, and a few dying plants in the window, which &s;ince Elvira's lo&s;s had been neglected, in&s;pired Antonia with a melancholy awe. The gloom of night gave &s;trength to this &s;en&s;a|tion. She placed her light upon the table, and &s;unk into a large chair, in which &s;he had &s;een her mother &s;eated a thou&s;and and a thou&s;and times. She was never to &s;ee her &s;eated there again! Tears unbidden &s;treamed down her cheek, and &s;he abandoned her&s;elf to the &s;adne&s;s which grew deeper with every moment.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="035729_0359_10065A9E26A50548">
A&s;hamed of her weakne&s;s, &s;he at length ro&s;e from her &s;eat; &s;he proceeded to &s;eek for what had brought her to this melancholy &s;cene. The &s;mall collection of books was arranged upon &s;everal &s;helves in order. Antonia examined them without finding any thing likely to intere&s;t her, till &s;he put her hand upon a vol|ume of old Spani&s;h ballads. She read a few &s;tanzas of one of them. They excited her curio&s;ity. She took down the book, and &s;eated her&s;elf to peru&s;e it with ea&s;e. She trimmed the taper which now drew towards its end, and then read the following ballad:</P>

<L>Away went poor Giles, to what place is not told.</L>
<L>Sally wept, till &s;he blew her no&s;e &s;ore!</L>
<L>But &s;carce had a twelvemonth elap&s;ed, when behold!</L>

<LG>
<L>His wealth, his pot-belly, and whi&s;ky of cane,</L>

<L>And now the roa&s;t beef had been ble&s;t by the prie&s;t,</L>
<L>To cram now the gue&s;ts had begun:</L>
<L>Tooth and nail like a wolf fell the bride on the fea&s;t;</L>
<L>Nor yet had the cla&s;h of her knife and fork cea&s;ed,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now as all wi&s;hed to &s;peak, but none knew what to &s;ay,</L>

<L>And his wig from his phiz deigns to pull.</L>
<L>Adzooks! what a &s;quall Sally gave through &s;urpri&s;e!</L>
<L>Like a pig that is &s;tuck how &s;he opened her eyes,</L>
<L>When &s;he recogni&s;ed Jollup's bare &s;kull!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Each mi&s;s then exclaimed, while &s;he turned up her &s;nout,</L>
<L>"Sir, your head isn't fit to be &s;een!"&mdash;</L>
<L>The pot-boys ran in, and the pot-boys ran out,</L>
<L>And couldn't conceive what the noi&s;e was about,</L>
<L>While the Doctor addre&s;&s;ed Sally Green;</L>

The peru&s;al of this &s;tory was ill calculated to di&s;|pel Antonia's melancholy. She had naturally a &s;trong inclination to the marvellous; and her nur&s;e, who believed firmly in apparitions, had related to her, when

<PB N="109" REF="035729_0364_10065AE0E13C58B8">
was often &s;u&s;ceptible of terrors, which, when &s;he di&s;|covered their natural and in&s;ignificant cau&s;e, made her blu&s;h at her own weakne&s;s. With &s;uch a turn of mind, the adventure which &s;he had ju&s;t been read|ing &s;ufficed to give her apprehen&s;ions the alarm. The hour and the &s;cene combined to authorize them. It was the dead of night; &s;he was alone, and in the chamber once occupied by her decea&s;ed mother. The weather was comfortle&s;s and &s;tormy; the wind howl|ed around the hou&s;e, the doors rattled in their frames, and the heavy rain pattered again&s;t the windows. No other &s;ound was heard. The taper, now burnt down to the &s;ocket, &s;ometimes flaring upwards, &s;hot a gleam of light through the room, then &s;inking again &s;eemed upon the point of expiring. Antonia's heart throbbed
<PB N="110" REF="035729_0365_10065AA4871DCED0">
with agitation; her eyes wandered fearfully over the objects around her, as the trembling flame illuminated them at intervals. She attempted to ri&s;e from her &s;eat, but her limbs trembled &s;o violently that &s;he was unable to proceed. She then called Flora, who was in a room at no great di&s;tance; but agitation choaked her voice, and her cries died away in hollow murmurs.</P>
<P>She pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome minutes in this &s;ituation, after which her terrors began to dimini&s;h. She &s;trove to recover her&s;elf, and acquire &s;trength enough to quit the room. Suddenly &s;he fancied that &s;he heard a low &s;igh drawn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> her. This idea brought back her former weakne&s;s. She had already rai&s;ed her&s;elf from her &s;eat, and was on the point of taking the lamp from the table. The imaginary noi&s;e &s;topped
<PB N="111" REF="035729_0366_10065AE26802DBE0">
her; &s;he drew back her hand, and &s;upported her&s;elf upon the back of a chair. She li&s;tened anxiou&s;ly, but nothing more was heard.</P>
<P>"Gracious God!" &s;he &s;aid to her&s;elf, "what could be that &s;ound? Was I deceived, or did I really hear it?"</P>
<P>Her reflections were interrupted by a voice at the door &s;carcely audible: it &s;eemed as if &s;omebody was whi&s;pering. Antonia's alarm increa&s;ed; yet the bolt &s;he knew to be fa&s;tened, and this idea in &s;ome degree rea&s;&s;ured her. Pre&s;ently the latch was lifted up &s;oftly, and the door moved with caution backwards and for|wards. Exce&s;s of terror now &s;upplied Antonia with that &s;trength of which &s;he had till then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eprived. She &s;tarted from her place, and made towards the clo&s;et door, whence &s;he might &s;oon have reached the chamber where &s;he expected to find Flora and Dame Jacintha. Scarcely had &s;he reached the middle of the room, when the latch was lifted up a &s;econd time. An involuntary movement obliged her to turn her head. Slowly and gradually the door turned upon its hinges, and &s;tanding upon the thre&s;hold, &s;he beheld a tall thin figure, wrapped in a white &s;hroud which covered it from head to foot.</P>
<P>This vi&s;ion arre&s;ted her feet; &s;he remained as if petrified in the middle of the apartment. The &s;tran|ger with mea&s;ured and &s;olemn &s;teps drew near the table. The dying taper darted a blue and melan|choly flame as the figure advanced towards it. Over the table was fixed a &s;mall clock; the hand of it was upon the &s;troke of three. The figure &s;topped oppo&s;ite to the clock; it rai&s;ed its right arm, and pointed to
<PB N="112" REF="035729_0367_10065AA9DD1AD9F8">
the hour, at the &s;ame time looking earne&s;tly upon An|tonia, who waited for the conclu&s;ion of this &s;cene, motionle&s;s and &s;ilent.</P>
<P>The figure remained in this po&s;ture for &s;ome mo|ments. The clock &s;truck. When the &s;ound had cea&s;ed, the &s;tranger advanced yet a few &s;teps nearer Antonia.</P>
<P>"Yet three days," &s;aid a voice faint, hollow, and &s;epulchral; "yet three days, and we meet again!"</P>
<P>Antonia &s;huddered at the words.</P>
<P>"We meet again?" &s;he pronounced at length with difficulty: "Where &s;hall we meet? Whom &s;hall I meet?"</P>
<P>The figure pointed to the ground with one hand, and with the other rai&s;ed the linen which covered its face.</P>
<P>"Almighty God! My mother?"</P>
<P>Antonia &s;hrieked, and fell lifele&s;s upon the floor.</P>
<P>Dame Jacintha, who was at work in a neighbour|ing chamber, was alarmed by the cry: Flora was ju&s;t gone down &s;tairs to fetch fre&s;h oil for the lamp by which they had been &s;itting. Jacintha therefore ha&s;|tened alone to Antonia's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and great was her amazement to find her extended upon the floor. She rai&s;ed her in her arms, conveyed her to her apartment, and placed her upon the bed, &s;till &s;en&s;ele&s;s. She then proceeded to bathe her temples, chafe her hands, and u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible means of bringing her to her&s;elf. With
<PB N="113" REF="035729_0368_10065AE3EFB44BA8">
&s;ome difficulty &s;he &s;ucceeded. Antonia opened her eyes, and looked round her wildly.</P>
<P>"Where is &s;he?" &s;he cried in a trembling voice: "Is &s;he gone? Am I &s;afe? Speak to me! Comfort me! Oh! &s;peak to me, for God's &s;ake!"</P>
<P>"Safe from whom, my child?" replied the a&s;ton|i&s;hed Jacintha: "What alarms you? Of whom are you afraid?"</P>
<P>"In three days! She told me that we &s;hould meet in three days! I heard her &s;ay it! I &s;aw her, Jacintha, I &s;aw her but this moment!"</P>
<P>She threw her&s;elf upon Jacintha's bo&s;om.</P>
<P>"You &s;aw her?&mdash;Saw whom?"</P>
<P>"My mother's gho&s;t!"</P>
<P>"Chri&s;t Je&s;us!" cried Jacintha; and, &s;tarting from the bed, let fall Antonia upon the pillow, and fled in con&s;ternation out of the room.</P>
<P>As &s;he ha&s;tened down &s;tairs &s;he met Flora a&s;cend|ing them.</P>
<P>"Go to your mi&s;tre&s;s, Flora," &s;aid &s;he; "here are rare doings! Oh! I am the mo&s;t unfortunate woman alive! My hou&s;e is filled with gho&s;ts and dead bodies, and the Lord knows what be&s;ides; yet I am &s;ure nobody likes &s;uch company le&s;s than I do. But go your way <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o Donna Antonia, Flora, and let me go mine."</P>
<P>Thus &s;aying, &s;he continued her cour&s;e to the &s;treet door, which &s;he opened; and, without allowing her|&s;elf
<PB N="114" REF="035729_0369_10065AAB65180478">
time to throw on her veil, &s;he made the be&s;t of her way to the Capuchin abbey. In the mean while, Flora ha&s;tened to her lady's chamber, equally &s;urpri&s;|ed and alarmed at Jacintha's con&s;ternation. She found Antonia lying upon the bed, in&s;en&s;ible. She u&s;ed the &s;ame means for her recovery that Jacintha had already employed; but finding that her mi&s;tre&s;s only recovered from one fit to fall into another, &s;he &s;ent in all ha&s;te for a phy&s;ician. While expecting his arrival, &s;he undre&s;&s;ed Antonia, and conveyed her to bed.</P>
<P>Heedle&s;s of the &s;torm, terrified almo&s;t out of her &s;en&s;es, Jacintha ran through the &s;treets, and &s;topped not till &s;he reached the gate of the abbey. She rang loudly at the bell, and as &s;oon as the porter appeared, &s;he de&s;ired permi&s;&s;ion to &s;peak to the &s;uperior. Am|bro&s;io was then conferring with Matilda upon the means of procuring acce&s;s to Antonia. The cau&s;e of Elvira's death remaining unknown, he was convinced that crimes were not &s;o &s;wiftly followed by puni&s;h|ment as his in&s;tructors the monks had taught him, and as till then he had him&s;elf believed. This per|&s;ua&s;ion made him re&s;olve to pur&s;ue his de&s;igns upon Antonia, for whom dangers and difficulties only &s;eem|ed to have increa&s;ed his pa&s;&s;ion. The monk had al|ready made one attempt to gain admi&s;&s;ion to her pre&s;|ence; but Flora had refu&s;ed him in &s;uch a manner as to convince him that all future endeavours mu&s;t be vain. Elvira had confided her &s;u&s;picions to that tru&s;ty &s;ervant: &s;he had de&s;ired her never to leave Ambro&s;io alone with her daughter, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to prevent their meeting altogether. Flora promi&s;ed to obey her, and had executed her orders to the very letter.
<PB N="115" REF="035729_0370_10065AE577E44210">
Ambro&s;io's vi&s;it had been rejected that morning, though Antonia was ignorant of it. He &s;aw that to obtain a &s;ight of his mi&s;tre&s;s by open means was out of the que&s;tion; and both him&s;elf and Matilda had con&s;umed the night in endeavouring to invent &s;ome plan, who&s;e event might be more &s;ucce&s;sful. Such was their employment when a lay brother enter|ed the abbot's cell, and informed him that a woman calling her&s;elf Jacintha Zuniga reque&s;ted audience for a few minutes.</P>
<P>Ambro&s;io was by no means di&s;po&s;ed to grant the petition of his vi&s;itor. He refu&s;ed it po&s;itively, and bade the lay brother tell the &s;tranger to return the next day. Matilda interrupted him&mdash;</P>
<P>"See this woman," &s;aid &s;he in a low voice; "I have my rea&s;ons."</P>
<P>The abbot obeyed her, and &s;ignified that he would go to the parlour immediately. With this an&s;wer the lay brother withdrew. As &s;oon as they were alone, Ambro&s;io inquired why Matilda wi&s;hed him to &s;ee this Jacintha.</P>
<P>"She is Antonia's ho&s;te&s;s, replied Matilda; "&s;he may po&s;&s;ibly be of u&s;e to you; but let us examine her, and learn what brings her hither."</P>
<P>They proceeded together to the parlour, where Ja|cintha was already waiting for the abbot. She had conceived a great opinion of his piety and virtue; and, &s;uppo&s;ing him to have much influence over the devil, thought that it mu&s;t be an ea&s;y matter for him to lay Elvira's gho&s;t in the Red Sea. Filled with this per|&s;ua&s;ion, &s;he had ha&s;tened to the abbey, As &s;oon as

&s;he &s;aw the monk enter the parlour, &s;he dropped upon her knees, and began her &s;tory as follows:</P>
<P>"Oh! reverend father! &s;uch an accident! &s;uch an adventure! I know not what cour&s;e to take; and unle&s;s you can help me, I &s;hall certainly go di&s;tracted. Well, to be &s;ure, never was woman &s;o unfortunate as my&s;elf! All in my power to keep clear of &s;uch abom|ination have I done, and yet that all is too little. What &s;ignifies my telling my beads four times a day, and ob&s;erving every fa&s;t pre&s;cribed by the calendar? What &s;ignifies my having made three pilgrimages to St James of Compo&s;tella, and purcha&s;ed as many par|dons from the pope as would buy off Cain's puni&s;h|ment? Nothing pro&s;pers with me! All goes wrong, and God only knows whether any thing will ever go right again!

For|&s;ooth it well becomes her to go racketing about my hou&s;e at midnight, popping into her daughter's room through the keyhole, and frightening the poor child

out of her wits! Though &s;he be a gho&s;t, &s;he might be more civil than to bolt into a per&s;on's hou&s;e who likes her company &s;o little. But as for me, reverend father, the plain &s;tate of the ca&s;e is this: if &s;he walks into my hou&s;e, I mu&s;t walk out of it, for I cannot abide &s;uch vi&s;itors&mdash;not I. Thus you &s;ee, your &s;anc|tity, that without your a&s;&s;i&s;tance I am ruined and un|done for ever. I &s;hall be obliged to quit my hou&s;e: nobody will take it when 'tis known that &s;he haunts it, and then I &s;hall find my&s;elf in a fine &s;ituation. Mi&s;erable woman that I am! what &s;hall I do? what will become of me?"</P>
<P>Here &s;he wept bitterly, wrung her hands, and beg|ged to know the abbot's opinion of her ca&s;e.</P>
<P>"In truth, good woman," replied he, "it will be difficult for me to relieve you, without knowing what is the matter with you. You have forgotten to tell me what has happened, and what it is you want."</P>
<P>"Let me die," cried Jacintha, "but your &s;anctity is in the right! This then is the fact &s;tated briefly&mdash;A lodger of mine is lately dead; a very good &s;ort of woman, that I mu&s;t needs &s;ay for her; as far as my knowledge of her went, though that was not a great way. She kept me too much at a di&s;tance; for in|deed &s;he was given to be upon the high ropes; and whenever I ventured to &s;peak to her; &s;he had a look with her which always made me feel a little queeri&s;h: God forgive me for &s;aying &s;o! However, though &s;he was more &s;tately than needful, and affected to look down upon me (though, if I am well informed, I come of as good parents as &s;he could do for her ears, for her father was a &s;hoemaker at Cordova, and mine was an

hatter at Madrid&mdash;aye, and a very creditable hatter too, let me tell you,) yet for all her pride &s;he was a quiet well behaved body, and I never wi&s;h to have a better lodger. This makes me wonder the more at her not &s;leeping quietly in her grave; but there is no tru&s;ting to people in this world. For my part, I never &s;aw her do ami&s;s, except on the Friday before her death. To be &s;ure, I was then much &s;candalized by &s;eeing her eat the wing of a chicken. 'How, Madona Flo|ra!' quoth I (Flora, may it plea&s;e your reverence, is the name of the waiting maid)&mdash;'how, Madona Flo|ra!' quoth I, 'does your mi&s;tre&s;s eat fle&s;h upon Fri|days? Well! well! &s;ee the event, and then remem|ber that Dame Jacintha warned you of it!' The&s;e were my very words; but, alas! I might as well have held my tongue. Nobody minded me: and Flora, who is &s;omewhat pert and &s;nappi&s;h (more is the pity, &s;ay I,) told me, that there was no more harm in eating a chicken than the egg from which it came: nay, &s;he even declared, that if her lady added a &s;lice of bacon, &s;he would not be an inch nearer damnation. God protect us! a poor ignorant &s;inful &s;oul! I prote&s;t to your holine&s;s, I trembled to hear her utter &s;uch bla&s;phemies, and expected every mo|ment to &s;ee the ground open and &s;wallow her up, chicken and all; for you mu&s;t know, wor&s;hipful father, that while &s;he talked thus, &s;he held the plate in her hand on which lay the identical roa&s;t fowl: and a fine bird it was, that I mu&s;t &s;ay for i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&mdash;done to a turn, for I &s;uperintended the cooking of it my&s;elf. It was a little gallician of my own rai&s;ing, may it plea&s;e your holine&s;s, and the fle&s;h was as white as an egg|&s;hell, as indeed Donna Elvira told me her&s;elf. 'Dame

Jacintha,' &s;aid &s;he very good humouredly, though, to &s;ay the truth, &s;he was always very polite to me&mdash;"</P>
<P>Here Ambro&s;io's patience failed him. Eager to know Jacintha's bu&s;ine&s;s in which Antonia &s;eemed to be concerned, he was almo&s;t di&s;tracted while li&s;tening to the rambling of this pro&s;ing old woman. He in|terrupted her, and prote&s;ted that if &s;he did not imme|diately tell her &s;tory and have done with it, he &s;hould quit the parlour, and leave her to get out of her diffi|culties by her&s;elf. This threat had the de&s;ired effect. Jacintha related her bu&s;ine&s;s in as few words as &s;he could ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">age: but her account was &s;till &s;o prolix, that Ambro&s;io had need of his patience to bear him to the conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>"And &s;o, your reverence," &s;aid &s;he, after relating Elvira's death and burial, with all their circum&s;tances&mdash;"and &s;o your reverence, upon hearing the &s;hriek, I put away my work, and away po&s;ted I to Donna Antonia's chamber. Finding nobody there, I pa&s;&s;ed on to the next: but I mu&s;t own I was a little timor|ous at going in; for this was the very room where Donna Elvira u&s;ed to &s;leep. However, in I went, and &s;ure enough there lay the young lady at full length upon the floor, as cold as a &s;tone, and as white as a &s;heet. I was &s;urpri&s;ed at this, as your holine&s;s may well &s;uppo&s;e: but, oh me! how I &s;hook when I &s;aw a great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">all figure at my elbow, who&s;e head touched the ceiling! The face was Donna Elvira's I mu&s;t confe&s;s; but out of its mouth came clouds of fire; its arms were loaded with heavy chains, which it rattled piteou&s;ly; and every hair on its head was a &s;erpent as big as my arm. At this I was frightened enough,
<PB N="120" REF="035729_0375_10065AB301138EF8">
and began to &s;ay my Ave Maria: but the gho&s;t inter|rupting me uttered three loud groans, and roared out in a terrible voice, 'Oh! that chicken's wing! my poor &s;oul &s;uffers for it.' As &s;oon as &s;he &s;aid this, the ground opened, the &s;pectre &s;unk down, I heard a clap of thunder, and the room was filled with a &s;mell of brim&s;tone. When I recovered from my fright, and had brought Donna Antonia to her&s;elf, who told me that &s;he cried out upon &s;eeing her mother's gho&s;t (and well might &s;he cry, poor &s;oul! had I been in her place, I &s;hould have cried ten times louder,) it directly came into my head, that if any one had power to quiet this &s;pectre, it mu&s;t be your reverence. So hither I came in all diligence, to beg that you will &s;prinkle my hou&s;e with holy water, and lay the apparition in the Red Sea."</P>
<P>Ambro&s;io &s;tared at this &s;trange &s;tory, which he could not credit.</P>
<P>"Did Donna Antonia al&s;o &s;ee the gho&s;t?" &s;aid he.</P>
<P>"As plain as I &s;ee you, reverend father."</P>
<P>Ambro&s;io pau&s;ed for a moment. Here was an op|portunity offered him of gaining acce&s;s to Antonia, but he he&s;itated to employ it. The reputation which he enjoyed in Madrid was &s;till dear to him; and &s;ince he had lo&s;t the reality of virtue, it appeared as if its &s;emblance was become more valuable. He was con|&s;cious that publicly to break through the rule never to quit the abbey precincts would derogate much from his &s;uppo&s;ed au&s;terity. In vi&s;iting Elvira, he had al|ways taken care to keep his features concealed from the dome&s;tics. Except by the lady, her daughter, and
<PB N="121" REF="035729_0376_10065AED6099D340">
the faithful Flora, he was known in the family by no other name than that of father Jerome. Should he comply with Jacintha's reque&s;t, and accompany her to her hou&s;e, he knew that the violation of his rule could not be kept a &s;ecret. However, his eagerne&s;s to &s;ee Antonia obtained the victory. He even hoped that the &s;ingularity of this adventure would ju&s;tify him in the eyes of Madrid. But whatever might be the con&s;equences, he re&s;olved to profit by the oppor|tunity which chance had pre&s;ented to him. An ex|pre&s;&s;ive look from Matilda confirmed him in his re&s;|olution.</P>
<P>"Good woman," &s;aid he to Jacintha, "what you tell me is &s;o extraordinary that I can &s;carcely credit your a&s;&s;ertions. However, I will comply with your reque&s;t. To-morrow, after matins, you ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> expect me at your hou&s;e: I will then examine into what I can do for you; and, if it is in my power, will free you from this unwelcome vi&s;itor. Now then go home, and peace be with you!"</P>
<P>"Home!" exclaimed Jacintha; "I go home? Not I, by my troth!&mdash;except under your protection, I &s;et no foot of mine within the thre&s;hold. God help me! the gho&s;t may meet me upon the &s;tairs, and whi&s;k me away with her to the devil! Oh! that I had accepted young Melchior Ba&s;co's offer! then I &s;hould have had &s;ome body to protect me: but now I am a lone woman, and meet with nothing but cro&s;&s;es and mi&s;|fortunes. Thank Heaven, it is not yet too late to re|pent. There is Simon Gonzalez will have me any day of the week; and if I live till daybreak, I will marry him out of hand: an hu&s;band I will have, that is determined; for, now this gho&s;t is once in my hou&s;e.
<PB N="122" REF="035729_0377_10065AB81F6C1CF8">
I &s;hall be frightened out of my wits to &s;leep alone. But, for God's &s;ake reverend father! come with me now. I &s;hall have no re&s;t till the hou&s;e is purified, or the poor young lady either. The dear girl! &s;he is in a piteous taking: I left her in &s;trong convul&s;ions, and I doubt &s;he will not ea&s;ily recover her fright."</P>
<P>The friar &s;tarted, and interrupted her ha&s;tily.</P>
<P>"In convul&s;ions, &s;ay you? Antonia in convul&s;ions? Lead on, good woman, I follow you this moment."</P>
<P>Jacintha in&s;i&s;ted upon his &s;topping to furni&s;h him&s;elf with a ve&s;&s;el of holy water. With this reque&s;t he complied. Thinking her&s;elf &s;afe under his protection &s;hould a legion of gho&s;ts attack her, the old woman returned the monk a profu&s;ion of thanks, and they de|parted together for the &s;trada di San Iago.</P>
<P>So &s;trong an impre&s;&s;ion had the &s;pectre made upon Antonia, that for the fir&s;t two or three hours, the phy&s;ician declared her life to be in danger. The fits at length becoming le&s;s frequent, induced him to alter his opinion. He &s;aid that to keep her quiet was all that was nece&s;&s;ary; and he ordered a medicine to be prepared, which would tranquillize her nerves, and procure her that repo&s;e which at pre&s;ent &s;he much wanted. The &s;ight of Ambro&s;io, who now appeared with Jacintha at her bed &s;ide, contributed e&s;&s;entially to compo&s;e her ruffled &s;pirits. Elvira had not &s;ufficient|ly explained her&s;elf upon the nature of his de&s;igns, to make a girl &s;o ignorant of the world as her daughter aware how dangerous was his acquaintance. At this moment, when, penetrated with horror at the &s;cene which had ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed, and dreading to contemplate the gho&s;t's prediction, her mind had need of all the
<PB N="123" REF="035729_0378_10065AB486C48B40">
&s;uccours of friend&s;hip and religion, Antonia regarded the abbot with an eye doubly partial. That &s;trong prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in his favour &s;til<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> exi&s;ted, which &s;he had felt for him at fir&s;t &s;ight: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fancied, yet knew not wherefore, that his pre&s;ence was a &s;afeguard to her from every danger, in&s;ult, or misfortune. She thank|ed him gratefully for his vi&s;it, and related to him the adventure which had alarmed her &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly.</P>
<P>The abbot &s;trove to rea&s;&s;ure her, and convince her that the whole had been a deception of her overheated fancy. The &s;olitude in which &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed the evening, the gloom of night, the book which &s;he had been reading, and the room in which &s;he &s;at, were all calculated to place before her &s;uch a vi&s;ion. He treat|ed the idea of gho&s;ts with ridicule, and produced &s;trong arguments to prove the fallacy of &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem. His conver&s;ation tranquillized and comforted her, but did not convince her. She could not believe that the &s;pectre had been a mere creature of her imagination: every circum&s;tance was impre&s;&s;ed upon her mind too forcibly to permit her flattering her&s;elf with &s;uch an idea. She per&s;i&s;ted in a&s;&s;erting that &s;he had really &s;een her mother's gho&s;t, had heard the period of her di&s;&s;olution announced, and declared that &s;he never, &s;hould quit her bed alive. Ambro&s;io advi&s;ed her again&s;t encouraging the&s;e &s;entiments, and then quitted her chamber, having promi&s;ed to repeat his vi&s;it on the morrow. Antonia received this a&s;&s;urance with every mark of joy; but the monk ea&s;ily perceived that he was not equally acceptable to her attendant. Flora obeyed Elvira's injunctions with the mo&s;t &s;cru|pulous ob&s;ervance. She examined with an anxious eye every circum&s;tance likely in the lea&s;t to prejudice
<PB N="124" REF="035729_0379_10065AB695BA87D0">
her young mi&s;tre&s;s, to whom &s;he had been attached for many years. She was a native of Cuba, had follow|ed Elvira to Spain, and loved the young Antonia with a mother's affection. Flora quitted not the room for a moment while the abbot remained there: &s;he watch|ed his every word, his every look, his every action. He &s;aw that her &s;u&s;picious eye was always fixed upon him; and, con&s;cious that his de&s;igns would not bear in&s;pection &s;o minute, he felt frequently confu&s;ed and di&s;concerted. He was aware that &s;he doubted the purity of his intentions; that &s;he would never leave him alone with Antonia: and, his mi&s;tre&s;s defended by the pre&s;ence of this vigilant ob&s;erver, he de&s;paired of finding the means to gratify his pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>As he quitted the hou&s;e, Jacintha met him, and begged that &s;ome ma&s;&s;es might be &s;ung for the repo&s;e of Elvira's &s;oul, which &s;he doubted not was &s;uffering in purgatory.</P>
<P>He promi&s;ed not to forget her reque&s;t; but he perfectly gained the old woman's heart, by engaging to watch during the whole of the approaching night in the haunted chamber. Jacintha could find no terms &s;ufficiently &s;trong to expre&s;s her gratitude, and the monk departed loaded with her benedictions.</P>
<P>It was broad day when he returned to the abbey. His fir&s;t care was to communicate what had pa&s;&s;ed to his confidant. He felt too &s;incere a pa&s;&s;ion for An|tonia, to have heard unmoved the prediction of her &s;peedy death, and he &s;huddered at the idea of lo&s;ing an object &s;o dear to him. Upon this head Matilda rea&s;|&s;ured him. She confirmed the arguments which him|&s;elf had already u&s;ed: &s;he declared Antonia to have
<PB N="125" REF="035729_0380_10065AF0D7CFE6C8">
been deceived by the wandering of her brain, by the &s;pleen which oppre&s;&s;ed her at the moment, and by the natural turn of her mind to &s;uper&s;tition and the mar|vellous. As to Jacintha's account, the ab&s;urdity re|futed it&s;elf. The abbot he&s;itated not to&punc; believe that &s;he had fabricated the whole &s;tory, either confu&s;ed by terror, or hoping to make him comply more readily with her reque&s;t. Having overruled the monk's ap|prehen&s;ions, Matilda continued thus:</P>
<P>"The prediction and the gho&s;t are equally fal&s;e: but it mu&s;t be your care, Ambro&s;io, to verify the fir&s;t. Antonia within three days mu&s;t indeed be dead to the world: but &s;he mu&s;t live for you. Her pre&s;ent ill|ne&s;s, and this fancy which &s;he has taken into her head, will colour a plan which I have long meditated, but which was impracticable without your procuring ac|ce&s;s to Antonia. She &s;hall be yours, and yours for ever. All the vigilance of her duenna &s;hall not avail her; but this very day mu&s;t the &s;cheme be put in ex|ecution, for you have no time to lo&s;e. The nephew of the duke of Medina Celi prepares to demand An|tonia for his bride: in a few days &s;he will be re|moved to the palace of her relation, the marquis de las Ci&s;ternas, and there &s;he will be &s;ecure from your attempts. Thus during your ab&s;ence have I been in|formed by my &s;pies, who are ever employed in bring|ing me intelligence for your &s;ervice. Now then li&s;ten to me. There is a juice extracted from certain herbs known but to few, which brings on the per&s;on who drinks it the exact image of death. Let this be ad|mini&s;tered to Antonia: you may ea&s;ily find means to pour a few drops into her medicine. The effect will be throwing her into &s;trong convul&s;ions for an hour:
<PB N="126" REF="035729_0381_10065ABB208A8548">
after which her blood will gradually cea&s;e to flow, and heart to beat: a mortal palene&s;s will &s;pread it&s;elf over her features, and &s;he will appear a cor&s;e to every eye. She has no friends about her: you may charge your&s;elf un&s;u&s;pected with the &s;uperintendance of her funeral, and cau&s;e her to be buried in the vaults of St. Clare. Their &s;olitude and ea&s;y acce&s;s render the&s;e caverns favourable to your de&s;igns. Give Antonia the &s;oporific draught this evening: eight and forty hours after &s;he has drank it, life will revive in her bo&s;om. She will then be ab&s;olutely in your power: &s;he will find all re&s;i&s;tance unavailing, and nece&s;&s;ity will com|pel her to receive you in her arms."</P>
<P>"Antonia will be in my power!" exclaimed the monk; "Matilda, you tran&s;port me! At length then happine&s;s will be mine, and that happine&s;s will be your gift, will be the gift of friend&s;hip! Oh! Ma|tilda, how can I expre&s;s to you my gratitude?"</P>
<P>"By profiting by my coun&s;els. Ambro&s;io I live but to &s;erve you; your intere&s;t and happine&s;s are equally mine. Be your per&s;on Antonia's, but to your friend&s;hip and your heart I &s;till a&s;&s;ert my claim. Con|tributing to yours forms now my only plea&s;ure. Should my exertions procure the gratification of your wi&s;hes, I &s;hall con&s;ider my trouble to be amply re|paid. But let us lo&s;e no time. The liquor of which I &s;poke is only to be found in St. Clare's laboratory. Ha&s;ten then to the priore&s;s, reque&s;t of her admi&s;&s;ion to the laboratory, and it will not be denied. There is a clo&s;et at the lower end of the great room, filled with liquids of different colours and qualities; the bottle in que&s;tion &s;tands by it&s;elf, upon the third &s;helf on the
<PB N="127" REF="035729_0382_10065AF25E0499D0">
left. It contains a greeni&s;h liquor: fill a &s;mall phial with it when you are unob&s;erved, and Antonia is your own."</P>
<P>The monk &s;crupled not to adopt this infamous plan. His pa&s;&s;ion, but too violent before, had acquired fre&s;h vigour from the &s;ight of Antonia; and, inflamed by the remembrance of her beauties, he entered into Ma|tilda's &s;cheme without he&s;itation.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner were matins over, than he bent his cour&s;e towards the convent of St. Clare. His arrival threw the whole &s;i&s;terhood into the utmo&s;t amaze|ment. The priore&s;s was &s;en&s;ible of the honor done her convent by his paying it his fir&s;t vi&s;it, and &s;trove to expre&s;s her gratitude by every po&s;&s;ible attention. He was paraded through the garden, &s;hown all the reliques of &s;aints and martyrs, and treated with as much re&s;pect and di&s;tinction as had he been the Pope him&s;elf. On his part, Ambro&s;io received the domina's civilities very graciou&s;ly, and &s;trove to remove her &s;urpri&s;e at his having broken through his re&s;olution. He &s;tated that among his penitents, illne&s;s prevented many from quitting their hou&s;es. The&s;e were ex|actly the people who mo&s;t needed his advice and the comforts of religion. Many repre&s;entations had been made to him upon this account, and, though highly repugnant to his own wi&s;hes, he had found it ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary, for the &s;ervice of Heaven, to change his determination, and quit his beloved retirement. The priore&s;s applauded his zeal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">, and his charity towards mankind. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">clared that Ma|drid was happy in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a man &s;o perfect and ir|reproachable.

<PB N="128" REF="035729_0383_10065ABDF2977250">
reached the laboratory: he found the clo&s;et; the bot|tle &s;tood in the place which Matilda had de&s;cribed, and the monk &s;eized an opportunity to fill his phial unob|&s;erved with the &s;oporific liquor. Then, having par|taken of a collation in the refectory, he retired from the convent, plea&s;ed with the &s;ucce&s;s of his vi&s;it, and leaving the nuns delighted by the honor conferred upon them.</P>
<P>He waited till evening before he took the road to Antonia's dwelling. Jacintha welcomed him with tran&s;port, and be&s;ought him not to forget his promi&s;e to pa&s;s the night in the haunted chamber. That promi&s;e he now repeated. He found Antonia tolera|bly well, but &s;till harping upon the gho&s;t's prediction. Flora moved not from her lady's bed, and, by &s;ymp|toms yet &s;tronger than on the former night, te&s;tified her di&s;like to the abbot's pre&s;ence. Still Ambro&s;io affected not to ob&s;erve them. The phy&s;ician arrived while he was conver&s;ing with Antonia. It was dark already: lights were called for, and Flora was com|pelled to de&s;cend for them her&s;elf. However, as &s;he left a third per&s;on in the room, and expected to be ab|&s;ent but a few minutes, &s;he believed that &s;he ri&s;ked nothing in quitting her po&s;t. No &s;ooner had &s;he left the room than Ambro&s;io moved towards the table, on which &s;tood Antonia's medicine. It was placed in a rece&s;s of the window. The phy&s;ician, &s;eated in an arm chair, and employed in que&s;tioning his patient, paid no attention to the proceedings of the monk. Ambro&s;io <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> opportunity; he drew out the fatal phial, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> a few drops fall into the medicine: he then ha&s;tily left the table, and returned to the &s;eat which he had quitted.

with lights, every thing &s;eemed to be ex|actly as &s;he had left it.</P>
<P>The phy&s;ician declared that Antonia might quit her chamber the next day with perfect &s;afety. He recom|mended her following the &s;ame pre&s;cription which on the night before had procured her a refre&s;hing &s;leep. Flora replied, that the draught &s;tood ready upon the table: he advi&s;ed the patient to take it without delay, and then retired. Flora poured the medicine into a cup, and pre&s;ented it to her mi&s;tre&s;s. At that mo|ment Ambro&s;io's courage failed him. Might not Ma|tilda have deceived him? Might not jealou&s;y have per&s;uaded her to de&s;troy her rival, and &s;ub&s;titute poi&s;on in the room of an opiate? This idea appeared &s;o rea&s;onable, that he was on the point of preventing her from &s;wallowing the medicine. His re&s;olution was adopted too late. The cup was already emptied, and Antonia re&s;tored it into Flora's hands. No remedy was now to be found: Ambro&s;io could only expect the moment impatiently de&s;tined to decide upon An|tonia's life or death, upon his own happine&s;s or de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Dreading to create &s;u&s;picion by his &s;tay, or betray him&s;elf by his mind's agitation, he took leave of his victim, and withdrew from the room. Antonia part|ed from him with le&s;s cordiality than on the former night. Flora had repre&s;ented to her mi&s;tre&s;s, that to admit his vi&s;its was to di&s;obey her mother's orders. She de&s;cribed to her his emotion on entering the room, and the fire which &s;parkled in his eyes while he gazed upon her. This had e&s;caped Antonia's ob|&s;ervation, but not her attendant's, who, explaining

the monk's de&s;igns, and their probable con&s;equences, in terms much clearer than Elvira's, though not quite &s;o delicate, had &s;ucceeded in alarming her young lady, and per&s;uading her to treat him more di&s;tantly than &s;he had done hitherto. The idea of obeying her mother's will at once determined Antonia. Though &s;he grieved at lo&s;ing his &s;ociety, &s;he conquered her|&s;elf &s;ufficiently to receive the monk with &s;ome degree of re&s;erve and coldne&s;s. She thanked him with re&s;pect and gratitude for his former vi&s;its, but did not invite his repeating them in future. It now was not the fri|ar's intere&s;t to &s;olicit admi&s;&s;ion to her pre&s;ence and he took leave of her as if not de&s;igning to return. Fully per&s;uaded that the acquaintance which &s;he dreaded was now at an end, Flora was &s;o much worked upon by his ea&s;y compliance, that &s;he began to doubt the ju&s;tice of her &s;u&s;picions. As &s;he lighted him down &s;tairs, &s;he thanked him for having endeavoured to root out from Antonia's mind her &s;uper&s;titious terrors of the &s;pectre's prediction: &s;he added, that, as he &s;eemed intere&s;ted in Donna Antonia's welfare, &s;hould any change take place in her &s;ituation, &s;he would be careful to let him know it. The monk, in replying, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ook pains to rai&s;e his voice, hoping that Jacintha would hear it. In this he &s;ucceeded. As he reached the foot of the &s;tairs with his conductre&s;s, the landlady failed not to make her appearance.</P>
<P>"Why, &s;urely you are not going away, reveren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> father?" cried &s;he: "Did you not promi&s;e to pa&s;s the night in the haunted chamber? Chri&s;t Je&s;us! I &s;hall be left alone with the gho&s;t, and a fine pickle I &s;hall be in by morning! Do all I could, &s;ay all I could, that ob&s;tinate old brute, Simon Gonzalez, re|fu&s;ed
<PB N="131" REF="035729_0386_10065AF6F255CDA0">
to marry me to-day: and before to-morrow comes, I &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hall be torn to pieces by the gho&s;ts and goblins and devils, and what not! For God's &s;ake, your holine&s;s, do not leave me in &s;uch a woful condi|tion! On my bended knees I be&s;eech you to keep your promi&s;e: watch this night in the haunted cham|ber; lay the apparition in the Red Sea, and Jacintha remembers you in her prayers to the la&s;t day of her exi&s;tence!"</P>
<P>This reque&s;t Ambro&s;io expected and de&s;ired; yet he affected to rai&s;e objections, and to &s;eem unwilling to keep his word. He told Jacintha that the gho&s;t ex|i&s;ted no where but in her own brain, and that her in|&s;i&s;ting upon his &s;taying all night in the hou&s;e was ri|diculous and u&s;ele&s;s. Jacintha was ob&s;tinate: &s;he was not to be convinced, and pre&s;&s;ed him &s;o urgently not to leave her a prey to the devil, that at length he granted her reque&s;t. All this &s;how of re&s;i&s;tance im|po&s;ed not upon Flora, who was naturally of a &s;u&s;pi|cious temper. She &s;u&s;pected the monk to be acting a part very contrary to his own inclinations, and that he wi&s;hed for no better than to remain where he was. She even went &s;o far as to believe that Jacintha was in his intere&s;t; and the poor old woman was immediately &s;et down as being no better than &s;he &s;hould be. While &s;he applauded her&s;elf for having penetrated into this plot again&s;t her lady's honor, &s;he re&s;olved in &s;ecret to render it fruitle&s;s.</P>
<P>"So then," &s;aid &s;he to the abbot with a look half &s;atirical and half indignant&mdash;"&s;o then you mean to &s;tay here to-night? Do &s;o, in God's name! Nobody will prevent you. Sit up to watch for the gho&s;t's ar|rival;
<PB N="132" REF="035729_0387_10065AC125329D10">
I &s;hall &s;it up too, and the Lord grant that I may &s;ee nothing wor&s;e than a gho&s;t? I quit not Don|na Antonia's bed &s;ide during this ble&s;&s;ed night. Let me &s;ee any one dare to enter the room, and be he mortal or immortal, be he gho&s;t, devil, or man, I warrant his repenting that ever he cro&s;&s;ed the thre&s;hold!"</P>
<P>This hint was &s;ufficiently &s;trong, and Ambro&s;io under&s;tood its meaning. But in&s;tead of &s;hewing that he perceived her &s;u&s;picions, he replied mildly, that he approved the duenna's precautions, and advi&s;ed her to per&s;evere in her intention. This &s;he a&s;&s;ured him faith|fully that he might depend upon her doing. Jacintha then conducted him into the chamber where the gho&s;t had appeared, and Flora returned to her lady's</P>
<P>Jacintha opened the door of the haunted room with a trembling hand: &s;he ventured to peep in, but the wealth of India would not have tempted her to cro&s;s the thre&s;hold. She gave the taper to the monk, wi&s;h|ed him well through the adventure, and ha&s;tened to be gone. Ambro&s;io entered. He bolted the door, placed the light upon the table, and &s;eated him&s;elf in the chair which on the former night had &s;u&s;tained Antonia. In &s;pite of Matilda's a&s;&s;urances that the &s;pectre was a mere creation of fancy, his mind was impre&s;&s;ed with a certain my&s;terious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. He in vain endeavoured to &s;hake it off. The &s;ilence of the night, the &s;tory of the apparition, the chamber wain&s;cotted with dark oak pannels, the recollection which it brought with it of the murdered Elvira, and his incertitude re&s;pecting the nature <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> drops given by him to Antonia, made him feel unea&s;y at his pre&s;ent &s;ituation. But he thought much le&s;s of the &s;pectre than of the poi&s;on. Should
<PB N="133" REF="035729_0388_10065AF88AAF8110">
he have de&s;troyed the only object which rendered life dear to him; &s;hould the gho&s;t's prediction prove true; &s;hould Antonia in three days be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> more, and he the wretched cau&s;e of her death . . . . The &s;uppo&s;ition was too horrible to dwell upon. He drove away the&s;e dreadful images, and as often they pre&s;ented them|&s;elves again before him. Matilda had a&s;&s;ured him that the effects of the opiate would be &s;peedy. He li&s;tened with fear, yet with eagerne&s;s, expecting to hear &s;ome di&s;turbance in the adjoining chamber. All was &s;till &s;ilent. He concluded that the drops had not begun to operate. Great was the &s;take for which he now played: a moment would &s;uffice to decide upon his mi&s;ery or happine&s;s. Matilda had taught him the means of a&s;certaining that life was not extinct for|ever; upon this a&s;&s;ay depended all his hopes. With every in&s;tant his impatience redoubled; his terrors grew more lively, his anxiety more awake. Unable to bear this &s;tate of incertitude, he endeavoured to divert it by &s;ub&s;tituting the thoughts of others for his own. The books, as was before mentioned, were ranged upon &s;helves near the table: this &s;tood exactly oppo&s;ite to the bed, which was placed in an alcove near the clo&s;et door. Ambro&s;io took down a volume, and &s;eated him&s;elf by the table: but his attention wandered from the pages before him. Antonia's image, and that of the murdered Elvira, per&s;i&s;ted to force them&s;elves before his imagination. Still he continued to read, though his eyes ran over the char|acters without his mind being con&s;cious of their im|port.</P>
<P>Such was his occupation when he fancied that he heard a foot&s;tep. He turned his head; but nobody
<PB N="134" REF="035729_0389_10065AC598242148">
was to be &s;een. He re&s;umed his book; but in a few minutes after, the &s;ame &s;ound was repeated, and fol|lowed by a ru&s;tling noi&s;e clo&s;e behind him. He now &s;tarted from his &s;eat, and, looking round him, per|ceived the clo&s;et door &s;tanding half unclo&s;ed. On his fir&s;t entering the room, he had tried to open it, but found it bolted on the in&s;ide.</P>
<P>"How is this?" &s;aid he to him&s;elf: "how comes this door unfa&s;tened?"</P>
<P>He advanced towards it, he pu&s;hed it open, and looked into the clo&s;et: no one was there. While he &s;tood irre&s;olute, he thought that he di&s;tingui&s;hed a groaning in the adjacent chamber: it was Antonia's, and he &s;uppo&s;ed that the drops began to take effect. But upon li&s;tening more attentively, he found the noi&s;e to be cau&s;ed by Jacintha, who had fallen a&s;leep by the lady's bed &s;ide, and was &s;noring mo&s;t lu&s;tily. Am|bro&s;io drew back, and returned to the other room, mu&s;ing upon the &s;udden opening of the clo&s;et door, for which he &s;trove in vain to account.</P>
<P>He paced the chamber up and down in &s;ilence. At length he &s;topped, and the bed attracted his attention. The curtain of the rece&s;s was but half drawn. He &s;ighed involuntarily.</P>
<P>"That bed," &s;aid he in a low voice, "that bed was Elvira's! There has &s;he pa&s;&s;ed many a quiet night, for &s;he was good and innocent. How &s;ound mu&s;t have been her &s;leep! and yet now &s;he &s;leeps &s;ounder! Does &s;he indeed &s;leep? Oh! God grant that &s;he may! What if &s;he ro&s;e from her grave at this &s;ad and &s;ilent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">? What if &s;he broke the bonds of the tomb, and
<PB N="135" REF="035729_0390_10065AFCFAC39058">
glided angrily before my bla&s;ted eyes? Oh! I never could &s;upport the &s;ight! Again to &s;ee her form di&s;|torted by dying agonies, her blood &s;wollen veins, her livid countenance, her eyes bur&s;ting from their &s;ock|ets with pain!&mdash;to hear her &s;peak of future puni&s;h|ment, menace me with Heaven's vengeance, tax me with the crimes I have committed, with tho&s;e I am going to commit . . . . . Great God! what is that?"</P>
<P>As he uttered the&s;e words, his eyes, which were fixed upon the bed, &s;aw the curtain &s;haken gently back|wards and forwards. The apparition was recalled to his mind, and he almo&s;t fancied that he beheld Elvira's vi&s;ionary form reclining upon the bed. A few mo|ments con&s;ideration &s;ufficed to rea&s;&s;ure him.</P>
<P>"It was only the wind," &s;aid he, recovering him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>Again he paced the chamber; but an involuntary movement of awe and inquietude con&s;tantly led his eye towards the alcove. He drew near it with irre&s;o|lution. He pau&s;ed before he a&s;cended the few &s;teps which led to it. He put out his hand thrice to remove the curtain, and as often drew it back.</P>
<P>"Ab&s;urd terrors!" he cried at length, a&s;hamed of his own weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>Ha&s;tily he mounted the &s;teps, when a figure dre&s;&s;ed in white &s;tarted from the alcove, and, gliding by him, made with precipitation towards the clo&s;et. Madne&s;s and de&s;pair now &s;upplied the monk with that courage, of which he had till then been de&s;titute. He &s;lew down the &s;teps, pur&s;ued the apparition, and attempted to gra&s;p it.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="035729_0391_10065AC71FDE6AB0">
"Gho&s;t, or devil, I hold you!" he exclaimed, and &s;eized the &s;pectre by the arm.</P>
<P>"Oh! Chri&s;t Je&s;us!" cried a &s;hrill voice; "holy father, how you gripe me! I prote&s;t that I meant no harm!"</P>
<P>This addre&s;s, as well as the arm which he held, convinced the abbot that the &s;uppo&s;ed gho&s;t was &s;ub|&s;tantial fle&s;h and blood. He drew the intruder to|wards the table, and, holding up the light, di&s;covered the features of . . . . . Madona Flora!</P>
<P>Incen&s;ed at having been betrayed by this trifling cau&s;e into fears &s;o ridiculous, he a&s;ked her &s;ternly, what bu&s;ine&s;s had brought her to that chamber. Flora, a&s;hamed at being found out, and terrified at the &s;everity of Ambro&s;io's looks, fell upon her knees, and promi&s;ed to make a full confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I prote&s;t reverend father," &s;aid &s;he, "that I am quite grieved at having di&s;turbed you; nothing was further from my intention. I meant to get out of the room as quietly as I got in; and had you been igno|rant that I watched you, you know it would have been the &s;ame thing as if I had not watched you at all. To be &s;ure I did very wrong in being a &s;py upon you&mdash;that I cannot deny. But, Lord! your reverence, how can a poor weak woman re&s;i&s;t curio&s;ity? Mine was &s;o &s;trong to know what you were doing, that I could not but try to get a little peep without any body know|ing any thing about it. So with that I left old Dame Jacintha &s;itting by my lady's bed, and I ventured to &s;teal into the clo&s;et. Being unwilling to interrupt you, I contented my&s;elf at fir&s;t with putting my eye to the keyhole; but as I could &s;ee nothing by this means, I
<PB N="137" REF="035729_0392_10063CB69BEAFCE8">
undrew the bolt, and, while your back was turned to the alcove, I whipt me in &s;oftly and &s;ilently. Here I lay &s;nug behind the curtain, till your reverence found me out, and &s;eized me ere I had time to regain the clo&s;et door. This is the whole truth, I a&s;&s;ure you, holy father, and I beg your pardon a thou&s;and times for my impertinence."</P>
<P>During this &s;peech the abbot had time to recollect him&s;elf: he was &s;atisfied with reading the penitent &s;py a lecture upon the dangers of curio&s;ity, and the mean|ne&s;s of the action in which &s;he had been ju&s;t di&s;cov|ered. Flora declared her&s;elf fully per&s;uaded that &s;he had done wrong; &s;he promi&s;ed never to be guilty of the &s;ame fault again, and was retiring very humble and contrite to Antonia's chamber, when the clo&s;et door was &s;uddenly thrown open, and in ru&s;hed Jacintha, pale and out of breath.</P>
<P>"Oh! Father! Father!" &s;he cried in a voice almo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hoaked with terror, "What &s;hall I do? What &s;hall I do? Here is a fine piece of work! Nothing but misfortunes! Nothing but dead people, and dying people! Oh! I &s;hall go di&s;tracted! I &s;hall go di&s;|tracted!"</P>
<P>"Speak! Speak!" cried Flora and the monk at the &s;ame time: "What has happened? what is the matter?"</P>
<P>"Oh! I &s;hall have another co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e in my hou&s;e! Some witch has certainly ca&s;t a &s;pell upon it, upon me, and upon all about me! Poor Donna Antonia! there &s;he lies in ju&s;t &s;uch convul&s;ions as killed her mother! The gho&s;t told her true! I am &s;ure the gho&s;t told her true!"</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="035729_0393_10065AC8A7B9A998">
Flora ran, or rather flew, to her lady's chamber: Ambro&s;io followed her, his bo&s;om trembling with hope and apprehen&s;ion. They found Antonia as Ja|cintha had de&s;cribed, torn by racking convul&s;ions, from which they in vain endeavoured to relieve her. The monk di&s;patched Jacintha to the abbey in all ha&s;te, and commi&s;&s;ioned her to bring father Pablos back with her without lo&s;ing a moment.</P>
<P>"I will go for him," replied Jacintha, "and tell him to come hither; but as to bringing him my&s;elf, I &s;hall do no &s;uch thing. I am &s;ure that the hou&s;e is bewitched, and burn me if ever I &s;et foot in it again!"</P>
<P>With this re&s;olution &s;he &s;et out for the mona&s;tery, and delivered to Father Pablos the abbot's orders. She then betook her&s;elf to the hou&s;e of old Simon Gonzalez, whom &s;he re&s;olved never to quit till &s;he had made him her hu&s;band, and his dwelling her own.</P>
<P>Father Pablos had no &s;ooner beheld Antonia, than he pronounced her incurable. The convul&s;ions con|tinued for an hour; during that time her agonies were much milder than tho&s;e which her groans created in the abbot's heart. Her every pang &s;eemed a dagger in his bo&s;om, and he cur&s;ed him&s;elf a thou&s;and times for having adopted &s;o barbarous a project. The hour be|ing expired, by degrees the fits became le&s;s frequent, and Antonia le&s;s agitated. She felt that her di&s;&s;olu|tion was approaching, and that nothing could &s;ave her.</P>
<P>"Worthy Ambro&s;io," &s;he &s;aid in a feeble voice, while &s;he pre&s;&s;ed his hand to her lips; "I am now at
<PB N="139" REF="035729_0394_10065AFE870A2B78">
liberty to expre&s;s how grateful is my heart for your attention and kindne&s;s. I am upon the bed of death; yet an hour, and I &s;hall be no more. I may therefore acknowledge without re&s;traint, that to relinqui&s;h your &s;ociety was very painful to me: but &s;uch was the will of a parent, and I dared not di&s;obey. I die without repugnance: there are few who will lament my leaving them&mdash;there are few whom I lament to leave. Among tho&s;e few, I lament for none more than for your&s;elf; but we &s;hall meet again Ambro&s;io! we &s;hall one day meet in heaven: there &s;hall our friend&s;hip be renewed, and my mother &s;hall view it with plea&s;ure!</P>
<P>She pau&s;ed. The abbot &s;huddered when &s;he men|tioned Elvira. Antonia imputed his emotion to pity and concern for her.</P>
<P>"You are grieved for me, Father," &s;he continued: "Ah! &s;igh not for my lo&s;s. I have no crimes to repent, at lea&s;t none of which I am con&s;cious; and I re&s;tore my &s;oul without fear to him from whom I re|ceived it. I have but few reque&s;ts to make; yet let me hope that what few I have &s;hall be granted. Let a &s;olemn ma&s;s be &s;aid for my &s;oul's repo&s;e, and another for that of my beloved mother; not that I doubt her re&s;ting in her grave. I am now convinced that my rea&s;on wandered, and the fal&s;ehood of the gho&s;t's prediction is &s;ufficient to prove my error. But every one has &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ailing: my mother may have had hers though I knew them not: I therefore wi&s;h a ma&s;s to be celebrated for her repo&s;e, and the ex|pen&s;e may be defrayed by the little wealth of which I am po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Whatever may then remain, I be|queath

to my aunt Leonella. When I am dead, let the marquis de las Ci&s;ternas know that his brother's un|happy family can no longer importune him. But di&s;appointment makes me unju&s;t: they tell me that he is ill, and perhaps, had it been in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, he wi&s;hed to have protected me. Tell him, then, Father, only that I am dead, and that if he had any faults to me, I forgave him from my heart. This done, I have nothing more to a&s;k for than your prayers. Promi&s;e to remember my reque&s;ts, and I &s;hall re&s;ign my life without a pang or &s;orrow."</P>
<P>Ambro&s;io engaged to comply with her de&s;ires, and proceeded to give her ab&s;olution. Every moment announced the approach of Antonia's fate. Her &s;ight failed, her heart beat &s;luggi&s;hly, her fingers &s;tiffened and grew cold, and at two in the morning &s;he expired without a groan. As &s;oon as the breath had for&s;aken her body, father Pablos retired, &s;incerely affected at the melancholy &s;cene. On her part, Flora gave way to the mo&s;t unbridled &s;orrow. Far different concerns employed Ambro&s;io: he &s;ought for the pul&s;e who&s;e throbbing, &s;o Matilda had a&s;&s;ured him, would prove Antonia's death but temporal. He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound it&mdash;he pre&s;&s;ed it&mdash;it palpitated beneath his hand, and his heart was filled with ec&s;tacy. However, he carefully concealed his &s;atisfaction at the &s;ucce&s;s of his plan. He a&s;&s;umed a melancholy air, and addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Flora, warned her again&s;t abandoning her&s;elf to fruitle&s;s &s;orrow. Her tears were too &s;incere to per|mit her li&s;tening to his coun&s;els, and &s;he continued to weep uncea&s;ingly. The friar withdrew, fir&s;t promi&s;|ing to give orders him&s;elf about the funeral, which, out of con&s;ideration for Jacintha, as he pretended,
<PB N="141" REF="035729_0396_10065BD0904A7C88">
&s;hould take place with all expedition. Plunged in grief for the lo&s;s of her beloved mi&s;tre&s;s, Flora &s;carcely attended to what he &s;aid. Ambro&s;io ha&s;tened to com|mand the burial. He obtained permi&s;&s;ion from the priore&s;s, that the cor&s;e &s;hould be depo&s;ited in St. Clare's &s;epulchre: and on the Friday morning, every proper and needful ceremony being performed, Anto|nia's body was committed to the tomb.</P>
<P>On the &s;ame day Leonella arrived at Madrid, in|tending to pre&s;ent her young hu&s;band to Elvira. Various circum&s;tances had obliged her to defer her journey from Tue&s;day to Friday; and &s;he had no op|portunity of making this alteration in her plans known to her &s;i&s;ter. As her heart was truly affectionate, and as &s;he had ever entertained a &s;incere regard for Elvira and her daughter, her &s;urpri&s;e at hearing of their &s;udden and melancholy fate was fully equalled by her &s;orrow and di&s;appointment. Ambro&s;io &s;ent to inform her of Antonia's beque&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> at her &s;olicitation, he promi&s;ed, as &s;oon as Elvira's trifling debts were di&s;charged, to tran&s;mit to her the remainder. This being &s;ettled, no other bu&s;ine&s;s detained Leonella in Madrid, and &s;he returned to Cordova with all dili|gence.</P>

<P>HIS whole attention bent upon bringing to ju&s;tice the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins of his &s;i&s;ter, Lorenzo little thought how &s;everely his intere&s;t was &s;uffering in another quarter. As was before mentioned, he returned not to Madrid till the evening of that day on which An|tonia was buried. Signifying to the Grand Inqui&s;itor the order of the cardinal duke (a ceremony not to be neglected when a member of the church was to be ar|re&s;ted publicly), communicating his de&s;ign to his un|cle and Don Ramirez, and a&s;&s;embling a troop of at|tendants &s;ufficient to prevent oppo&s;ition, furni&s;hed him with full occupation during the few hours pre|ceding midnight. Con&s;equently he had no opportu|nity to inquire about his mi&s;tre&s;s, and was perfectly ignorant both of her death and her mother's.</P>
<P>The marquis was by no means out of danger: his delirium was gone, but had left him &s;o much ex|hau&s;ted, that the phy&s;icians declined pronouncing upon the con&s;equences likely to en&s;ue. As for Raymond him&s;elf, he wi&s;hed for nothing more earne&s;tly than to join Agnes in the grave. Exi&s;tence was hateful to him: he &s;aw nothing in the world de&s;erving his at|tention; and he hoped to hear that Agnes was re|venged and him&s;elf given over in the &s;ame moment.</P>

Followed by Raymond's ardent prayers for &s;ucce&s;s, Lorenzo was at the gates of St. Clare a full hour be|fore the time appointed by the mother St. Ur&s;ula. He was accompanied by his uncle, by Don Ramirez de Mello, and a party of cho&s;en archers. Though in con&s;iderable numbers, their appearance created no &s;urpri&s;e: a great crowd was already a&s;&s;embled before the convent doors, in order to witne&s;s the proce&s;&s;ion. It was naturally &s;uppo&s;ed, that Lorenzo and his at|tendants were conducted thither by the &s;ame de&s;ign. The duke of Medina being recogni&s;ed, the people drew back, and made way for his party to advance. Lorenzo placed him&s;elf oppo&s;ite to the great gate, through which the pilgrims were to pa&s;s. Convinced that the priore&s;s could not e&s;cape him, he waited pa|tiently for her appearance, which &s;he was expected to make exactly at midnight.</P>
<P>The nuns were employed in religious duties e&s;tab|li&s;hed in honor of St. Clare, and to which no profane was ever admitted. The chapel windows were illu|minated. As they &s;tood on the out&s;ide, the auditors heard the full &s;well of the organ, accompanied by a chorus of female voices, ri&s;e upon the &s;tillne&s;s of the night. This died away, and was &s;ucceeded by a &s;in|gle &s;train of harmony: it was the voice of her who was de&s;tined to &s;u&s;tain in the proce&s;&s;ion the character of St. Clare. For this office the mo&s;t beautiful virgin of Madrid was always &s;elected, and &s;he upon whom the choice fell, e&s;teemed it as the highe&s;t of honors. While li&s;tening to the mu&s;ic, who&s;e melody di&s;tance only &s;eemed to render &s;weeter,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LG>

wrapped up in profound attention. Univer&s;al &s;ilence prevailed through the crowd, and every heart was filled with reverence for religion&mdash;every heart but Loren|zo's. Con&s;cious that among tho&s;e who chanted the prai&s;es of their God &s;o &s;weetly there were &s;ome who cloaked with devotion the foule&s;t &s;ins, their hymns in|&s;pired him with dete&s;tation of their hypocri&s;y. He had long ob&s;erved with di&s;approbation and contempt the &s;uper&s;tition which governed Madrid's inhabitants. His good &s;en&s;e had pointed out to him the artifices of the monks, and the gro&s;s ab&s;urdity of their miracles, wonders, and &s;uppo&s;ititious reliques. He blu&s;hed to &s;ee his countrymen the dupes of deceptions &s;o ridicu|lous, and only wi&s;hed for an opportunity to free them from their monki&s;h fetters. That opportunity, &s;o long de&s;ired in vain, was at length pre&s;ented to him. He re&s;olved not to let it &s;lip, but to &s;et before the peo|ple, in glaring colours, how enormous were the abu&s;es but too frequently practi&s;ed in mona&s;teries, and how unju&s;tly public e&s;teem was be&s;towed indi&s;criminately upon all who wore a religious habit. He longed for the moment de&s;tined to unma&s;k the hypocrites, and convince his countrymen, that a &s;anctified exterior does not always hide a virtuous heart.</P>
<P>The &s;ervice la&s;ted till midnight was announced by the convent bell. That &s;ound being heard, the mu&s;ic cea&s;ed: the voices died away &s;oftly, and &s;oon after the lights di&s;appeared <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the chapel windows. Lo|renzo's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">, when he found the execution of his plan to be nea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> at hand. From the natural &s;uper&s;tition of the people he had prepared him&s;elf for &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance; but he tru&s;ted that the mother St. Ur&s;ula would bring good rea&s;ons to ju&s;tify his pro|ceeding.
<PB N="145" REF="035729_0400_10065B0196CDD078">
He had force with him to repel the fir&s;t im|pul&s;e of the populace, till his arguments &s;hould be heard: his only fear was, le&s;t the domia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, &s;u&s;pecting his de&s;ign, &s;hould have &s;pirited away the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> on who&s;e depo&s;ition every thing depended. Unle&s;s the mother St. Ur&s;ula &s;hould be pre&s;ent, he could only accu&s;e the priore&s;s upon &s;u&s;picion; and this reflection gave him &s;ome little apprehen&s;ion for the &s;ucce&s;s of his enter|pri&s;e. The tranquillity which &s;eemed to reign through the convent, in &s;ome degree rea&s;&s;ured him: &s;till he expected the moment eagerly, when the pre&s;|ence of his ally &s;hould deprive him of the power of doubting.</P>
<P>The abbey of Capuchins was only &s;eparated from the convent by the garden and cemetery. The monks had been invited to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the pilgrimage. They now arrived, marching two by two with lighted torches in their hands, and chanting hymns in honor of St. Clare. Father Pablos was at their head, the abbot having excu&s;ed him&s;elf from attending. The people made way for the holy train, and the friars placed them&s;elves in ranks on either &s;ide of the great gates. A few minutes &s;ufficed to arrange the order of the proce&s;&s;ion. This being &s;ettled, the convent doors were thrown open, and again the female chorus &s;ound|ed in full melody. Fir&s;t appeared a band of chor|i&s;ters. As &s;oon as they had pa&s;&s;ed, the monks fell in two by two, and followed with &s;teps &s;low and mea&s;|ured: next came the novices: they bore no tapers as did the profe&s;&s;ed, but moved on with eyes bent down|wards, and &s;eemed to be occupied by telling their beads. To them &s;ucceeded a young and lovely girl, who repre&s;ented St. Lucia: &s;he held a golden ba&s;on,
<PB N="146" REF="035729_0401_10065B3CD2D5A7C0">
in which were two eyes: her own were covered by a velvet bandage, and &s;he was conducted by another nun habited as an angel. She was followed by St. Catherine, a palm branch in one hand, a flaming &s;word in the other; &s;he was robed in white, and her brow was ornamented with a &s;parkling diadem. Af|ter her appeared St. Genevieve, &s;urrounded by a num|ber of imps, who, putting them&s;elves into grote&s;que attitudes, drawing her by the robe, and &s;porting round her with antic ge&s;tures, endeavoured to di&s;tract her at|tention from the book on which her eyes were con|&s;tantly fixed. The&s;e merry devils greatly entertained the &s;pectators, who te&s;tified their plea&s;ure by repeated bur&s;ts of laughter. The priore&s;s had been careful to &s;elect a nun who&s;e di&s;po&s;ition was naturally &s;olemn and &s;aturnine. She had every rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with her choice: the drolleries of the imps were en|tirely thrown away, and St. Genevieve moved on without di&s;compo&s;ing a mu&s;cle.</P>
<P>Each of the&s;e &s;aints was &s;eparated from the other by a band of chori&s;ters, exalting her prai&s;e in their hymns, but declaring her to be very much inferior to St. Clare, the convent's avowed patrone&s;s. The&s;e having pa&s;&s;ed, a long train of nuns appeared, bearing like the chori&s;ters, each a burning taper. Next came the reliques of St. Clare, inclo&s;ed in va&s;es equally precious for their materials and workman&s;hip: but they attracted not Lorenzo's attention. The nun who bore the heart occupied him entirely. Accord|ing to Theodore's de&s;cription, he doubted not her be|ing the mother St. Ur&s;ula. She &s;eemed to look round with anxiety. As he &s;tood foremo&s;t in the rank by which the proce&s;&s;ion pa&s;&s;ed, her eye caught Lorenzo's.
<PB N="147" REF="035729_0402_10065B0475CC9158">
A flu&s;h of joy over&s;pread her till then pallid cheek. She turned to her companion eagerly.</P>
<P>"We are &s;afe," he heard her whi&s;per, "'tis her brother."</P>
<P>His heart being now at ea&s;e, Lorenzo gazed with tranquillity upon the remainder of the &s;how. Now appeared its mo&s;t brilliant ornament: it was a ma|chine fa&s;hioned like a throne, rich with jewels, and dazzling with light. It rolled onwards upon con|cealed wheels, and was guided by &s;everal lovely chil|dren dre&s;&s;ed as &s;eraphs. The &s;ummit was covered with &s;ilver clouds, upon which reclined the mo&s;t beautiful form that eyes ever witne&s;&s;ed. It was a dam&s;el repre&s;enting St. Clare: her dre&s;s was of in|e&s;timable price, and round her head a wreath of dia|monds formed an artificial glory: but all the&s;e orna|ments yielded to the lu&s;tre of her charms. As &s;he ad|vanced, a murmur of delight ran through the crowd. Even Lorenzo confe&s;&s;ed &s;ecretly, that he never beheld more perfect beauty; and had not his heart been An|tonia's, it mu&s;t have fallen a &s;acrifice to this enchant|ing girl. As it was, he con&s;idered her only as a fine &s;tatue: &s;he obtained from him no tribute &s;ave cold admiration: and when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he had pa&s;&s;ed him, he thought of her no more.</P>
<P>"Who is &s;he?" a&s;ked a by&s;tander in Lorenzo's hearing.</P>
<P>"One who&s;e beauty you mu&s;t often have heard celebrated. Her name is Virginia de Villa Franca: &s;he is a pen&s;ioner of St. Clare's convent, a relation of the priore&s;s, and has been &s;elected with ju&s;tice as the ornament of the proce&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="035729_0403_10065B3FD95AB900">
The throne moved onwards. It was followed by the priore&s;s her&s;elf: &s;he marched at the head of the remaining nuns with a devout and &s;anctified air, and clo&s;ed the proce&s;&s;ion. She moved on &s;lowly: her eyes were rai&s;ed to Heaven: her countenance calm and tranquil, &s;eemed ab&s;tracted from all &s;ublunary things, and no feature betrayed her &s;ecret pride at di&s;|playing the pomp and opulence of her convent. She pa&s;&s;ed along, accompanied by the prayers and bene|dictions of the populace: but how great was the general confu&s;ion and &s;urpri&s;e when Don Ramirez, &s;tarting forward, challenged her as his pri&s;oner!</P>
<P>For a moment amazement held the domina &s;ilent and immoveable: but no &s;ooner did &s;he recover her|&s;elf, than &s;he exclaimed again&s;t &s;acrilege and impiety, and called upon the people to re&s;cue a daughter of the church. They were eagerly preparing to obey her, when Don Ramirez, protected by the archers from their rage, commanded them to forbear, and threat|ened them with the &s;evere&s;t vengeance of the Inqui|&s;ition. At that dreaded word every arm fell, every &s;word &s;hrunk back into its &s;cabbard. The priore&s;s her&s;elf turned pale, and trembled. The general &s;ilence convinced her that &s;he had nothing to hope but from innocence, and &s;he be&s;ought Don Ramirez in a faltering voice to inform her of what crime &s;he was accu&s;ed.</P>
<P>"That you &s;hall know in time," replied he; "but fir&s;t I mu&s;t &s;ecure the mother St. Ur&s;ula."</P>
<P>"The mother St. Ur&s;ula?" repeated the domina faintly.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="035729_0404_10065B07FB508A30">
At this moment ca&s;ting her eyes round, &s;he &s;aw Lorenzo and the duke, who had followed Don Ra|mirez.</P>
<P>"Ah! great God!" &s;he cried, cla&s;ping her hands together with a frantic air, "I am betrayed."</P>
<P>"Betrayed?" replied St. Ur&s;ula, who now arrived conducted by &s;ome of the archers, and followed by the nun her companion in the proce&s;&s;ion: "not be|trayed, but di&s;covered. In me recogni&s;e your accu|&s;er: you know not how well I am in&s;tructed in your guilt:&mdash;Segnor," &s;he continued, turning to Don Ra|mirez, "I commit my&s;elf to your cu&s;tody. I charge the priore&s;s of St. Clare with murder, and &s;take my life for the ju&s;tice of my accu&s;ation."</P>
<P>A general cry of &s;urpri&s;e was uttered by the whole audience, and an explanation was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> demanded. The trembling nuns, terrified at the noi&s;e and uni|ver&s;al confu&s;ion, had di&s;per&s;ed, and fled different ways. Some regained the convent: others &s;ought refuge in the dwellings of their relations; and many, only &s;en|&s;ible of their pre&s;ent danger, and anxious to e&s;cape from the tumult, ran through the &s;treets, and wan|dered they knew not whither. The lovely Virginia was one of the fir&s;t to fly. And in order that &s;he might be better &s;een and heard, the people de&s;ired that St. Ur&s;ula &s;hould harrangue them from the vacant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">. The nun complied: &s;he a&s;cended the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> machine, and then addre&s;&s;ed the &s;urrounding multitude as follows:</P>
<P>"However &s;trange and un&s;eemly may appear my conduct, when con&s;idered to be adopted by a female
<PB N="150" REF="035729_0405_10065B41610844B0">
and a nun, nece&s;&s;ity will ju&s;tify it mo&s;t fully. A &s;ecret, an horrible &s;ecret weighs heavy upon my &s;oul: no re&s;t can be mine till I have revealed it to the world, and &s;atisfied that innocent blood which calls from the grave for vengeance. Much have I dared, to gain this opportunity of lightening my con&s;cience. Had I failed in my attempt to reveal the crime, had the domina but &s;u&s;pected that the my&s;tery was known to me, my ruin was inevitable. Angels who watch un|cea&s;ingly over tho&s;e who de&s;erve their favour, have enabled me to e&s;cape detection. I am now at liberty to relate a tale, who&s;e circum&s;tances will freeze every hone&s;t &s;oul with horror. Mine is the ta&s;k to rend the veil from hypocri&s;y, and &s;hew mi&s;guided parents to what dangers the woman is expo&s;ed, who falls under the &s;way of a mona&s;tic tyrant.</P>
<P>"Among the votaries of St. Clare, none was more lovely, none more gentle, than Agnes de Medina. I knew her well: &s;he entru&s;ted to me every &s;ecret of her heart: I was her friend and confidant, and I loved her with &s;incere affection. Nor was I &s;ingu|lar in my attachment. Her piety unfeigned, her willingne&s;s to oblige, and her angelic di&s;po&s;ition, ren|dered her the darling of all that was e&s;timable in the convent. The priore&s;s her&s;elf, proud, &s;crupulous and forbidding, could not refu&s;e Agnes that tribute of approbation which &s;he be&s;towed upon no one el&s;e. Every one has &s;ome fault. Alas! Agnes had her weakne&s;s: &s;he violated the laws of our order, and in|curred the inveterate hate of the unforgiving domina. St. Clare's rules are &s;evere: but grown antiquated and neglected, many of late years have either been forgotten, or changed by univer&s;al con&s;ent into milder
<PB N="151" REF="035729_0406_10065B09A7008EE0">
puni&s;hments. The penance adjudged to the crime of Agnes was mo&s;t cruel, mo&s;t inhuman. The law had been long exploded. Alas! it &s;till exi&s;ted, and the revengeful priore&s;s now determined to revive it. This law decreed, that the offender &s;hould be plunged into a private dungeon, expre&s;sly con&s;tituted to hide from the world for ever the victim of cruelty and ty|rannic &s;uper&s;tition. In this dreadful abode &s;he was to lead a perpetual &s;olitude, deprived of all &s;ociety, and believed to be dead by tho&s;e whom affection might have prompted to attempt her re&s;cue. Thus was &s;he to langui&s;h out the remainder of her days, with no other food than bread and water, and no other com|fort than the free indulgence of her tears."</P>
<P>The indignation created by this account was &s;o violent, as for &s;ome moments to interrupt St. Ur&s;u|la's narrative. When the di&s;turbance cea&s;ed, and &s;ilence again prevailed through the a&s;&s;embly, &s;he con|tinued her di&s;cour&s;e, while at every word the domina's countenance betrayed her increa&s;ing terrors.</P>
<P>"A council of the twelve elder nuns was called: I was of the number. The priore&s;s in exaggerated colours de&s;cribed the offence of Agnes, and &s;crupled not to propo&s;e the revival of this almo&s;t forgotten law. To the &s;hame of our &s;ex be it &s;poken, that, either &s;o ab&s;olute was the domina's will in the convent, or &s;o much had di&s;appointment, &s;olitude, and &s;elf denial hardened their hearts and &s;oured their tempers, this barbarous propo&s;al was a&s;&s;ented to by nine voices out of the twelve. I was not one of the nine. Fre|quent opportunities had convinced me of the virtues of Agnes, and I loved and pitied her mo&s;t &s;incerely. The mothers Bertha and Cornelia joined my party:
<PB N="152" REF="035729_0407_10065B44CC52F010">
we made the &s;tronge&s;t oppo&s;ition po&s;&s;ible, and the &s;u|perior found her&s;elf compelled to change her inten|tion. In &s;pite of the majority in her favour, &s;he feared to break with us openly. She knew that, &s;up|ported by the Medina family, our forces would be too &s;trong for her to cope with: and &s;he al&s;o knew that, after being once impri&s;oned, and &s;uppo&s;ed dead, &s;hould Agnes be di&s;covered, her ruin would be inevita|ble; &s;he therefore gave up her de&s;ign, though with much reluctance. She demanded &s;ome days to reflect upon a mode of puni&s;hment, which might be agreea|ble to the whole community; and &s;he promi&s;ed, that as &s;oon as her re&s;olution was fixed, the &s;ame council &s;hould be again &s;ummoned. Two days pa&s;&s;ed away: on the evening of the third it was announced, that on the next morning Agnes &s;hould be examined: and that according to her behaviour on that occa&s;ion her puni&s;hment &s;hould be either &s;trengthened or miti|gated.</P>
<P>"On the night preceding this examination, I &s;tole to the cell of Agnes at an hour when I &s;uppo&s;ed the other nuns to be buried in &s;leep. I comforted her to the be&s;t of my power: I bade her take courage, told her to rely upon the &s;upport of her friends, and taught her certain &s;igns, by which I might in&s;truct her to an|&s;wer the domina's que&s;tions by an a&s;&s;ent or negative. Con&s;cious that her enemy would &s;trive to confu&s;e, embarra&s;s, and daunt her, I feared her being en&s;nared into &s;ome confe&s;&s;ion prejudicial to her intere&s;ts. Be|ing anxious to keep my vi&s;it &s;ecret, I &s;tayed with Ag|nes but a &s;hort time. I bade her not to let her &s;pirits be ca&s;t down. I mingled my tears with tho&s;e which &s;treamed down her cheek, embraced her fondly, and
<PB N="153" REF="035729_0408_10065B0B31DFF1C0">
was on the point of retiring, when I heard the &s;ound of &s;teps approaching the cell. I &s;tarted back. A cur|tain which veiled a large crucifix offered me a retreat, and I ha&s;tened to place my&s;elf behind it. The door opened. The priore&s;s entered, followed by four other nuns. They advanced towards the bed of Agnes. The &s;uperior reproached her with her errors in the bit|tere&s;t terms. She told her, that &s;he was a di&s;grace to the convent, that &s;he was re&s;olved to deliver the world and her&s;elf from &s;uch a mon&s;ter, and commanded her to drink the contents of a goblet now pre&s;ented to her by one of the nuns. Aware of the fatal properties of the liquor, and trembling to find her&s;elf upon the brink of eternity, the unhappy girl &s;trove to excite the dom|ina's pity by the mo&s;t affecting prayers. She &s;ued for life in terms which might have melted the heart of a fiend. She promi&s;ed to &s;ubmit patiently to any pun|i&s;hment, to &s;hame, impri&s;onment, and torture, might &s;he but be permitted to live! Oh! might &s;he but live another month, or week, or day! Her mercile&s;s enemy li&s;tened to her complaints unmoved: &s;he told her, that at fir&s;t &s;he meant to have &s;pared her life, and that if &s;he had altered her intention &s;he had to thank the oppo&s;ition of her friends. She continued to in&s;i&s;t upon her &s;wallowing the poi&s;on: &s;he bade her recommend her&s;elf to the Almighty's mercy, not to her's and a&s;&s;ured her that in an hour &s;he would be numbered with the dead. Perceiving that it was vain to implore this unfeeling woman, &s;he attempted to &s;pring from her bed, and call for a&s;&s;i&s;tance: &s;he hoped, if &s;he could not e&s;cape the fate announced to her, at lea&s;t to have witne&s;&s;es of the violence committed. The priore&s;s gue&s;&s;ed her de&s;ign: &s;he &s;eized her forci|bly by the arm, and pu&s;hed her back upon her pillow;
<PB N="154" REF="035729_0409_10065B465410D358">
at the &s;ame time drawing a dagger, and placing it at the brea&s;t of the unfortunate Agnes, &s;he prote&s;ted that if &s;he uttered a &s;ingle cry, or he&s;itated a &s;ingle moment to drink the poi&s;on, &s;he would pierce her heart that in&s;tant. Already half dead with fear, &s;he could make no further re&s;i&s;tance. The nun approached with the fatal goblet; the domina obliged her to take it, and &s;wallow the contents. She drank, and the horrid deed was accompli&s;hed. The nuns then &s;eated them&s;elves round the bed; they an&s;wered her groans with re|proaches; they interrupted with &s;arca&s;ms the prayers in which &s;he recommended her parting &s;oul to mercy&punc; they threatened her with Heaven's vengeance and eternal perdition; they bade her de&s;pair of pardon, and &s;trowed with yet &s;harper thorns, death's painful pillow. Such were the &s;ufferings of this young un|fortunate till relea&s;ed by fate from the malice of her tormentors. She expired in horror of the pa&s;t, in fears for the future; and her agonies were &s;uch as mu&s;t have amply gratified the hate and vengeance of her enemies. As &s;oon as her victim cea&s;ed to breathe, the domina retired, and was followed by her accom|plices.</P>
<P>"It was now that I ventured from my conceal|ment. I dared not to a&s;&s;i&s;t my unhappy friend, aware that, without pre&s;erving her, I &s;hould only have brought on my&s;elf the &s;ame de&s;truction. Shocked and terrified beyond expre&s;&s;ion at this horrid &s;cene, &s;carce|ly had I &s;ufficient &s;trength to regain my cell. As I reached the door of that of Agnes, I ventured to look towards the bed on which lay her lifele&s;s body, once &s;o lovely and &s;o &s;weet! I breathed a prayer for her de|parted &s;pirit, and vowed to revenge her death by the

&s;hame and puni&s;hment of her a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. With danger and difficulty I have kept my oath. I unwarily drop|ped &s;ome words at the funeral of Agnes, while thrown off my guard by exce&s;&s;ive grief, which alarmed the guilty con&s;cience of the priore&s;s. My every action was ob&s;erved; my every &s;tep was traced. I was con|&s;tantly &s;urrounded by the &s;uperior's &s;pies. It was long before I could find the means of conveying to the unhappy girl's relations an intimation of my &s;e|cret. It was given out, that Agnes had expired &s;ud|denly: this account was credited not only by her friends in Madrid, but even by tho&s;e within the con|vent. The poi&s;on had left no marks upon her body: no one &s;u&s;pected the true cau&s;e of her death, and it re|mained unknown to all, &s;ave the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins and my&s;elf.</P>
<P>"I have no more to &s;ay; for what I have already &s;aid, I will an&s;wer with my life. I repeat that the priore&s;s is a murdere&s;s; that &s;he has driven from the world, perhaps from Heaven, an unfortunate, who&s;e offence was light and venial; that &s;he has abu&s;ed the power entru&s;ted to her hands, and has been a tyrant, a barbarian, and an hypocrite. I al&s;o accu&s;e the four nuns. Violante, Camilla, Alix, and Mariana, as being her accomplices, and equally criminal."</P>
<P>Here St. Ur&s;ula ended her narrative. It created horror and &s;urpri&s;e throughout; but when &s;he relat|ed the inhuman murder of Agnes, the indignation of the mob was &s;o audibly te&s;tified, that it was &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to hear the conclu&s;ion. This confu&s;ion in|crea&s;ed with every moment. At length a multitude of voices exclaimed, that the priore&s;s &s;hould be given up to their fury. To this Don Ramirez po&s;itively re|fu&s;ed

to con&s;ent. Even Lorenzo bade the people re|member that &s;he had undergone no trial, and advi&s;ed them to leave her puni&s;hment to the Inqui&s;ition. All repre&s;entations were fruitle&s;s; the di&s;turbance grew &s;till more violent, and the populace more exa&s;perated. In vain did Ramirez attempt to convey his pri&s;oner out of the throng. Wherever he turned, a band of rioters barred his pa&s;&s;age, and demanded her being delivered over to them more loudly than before. Ra|mirez ordered his attendants to cut their way through the multitude. Oppre&s;&s;ed by numbers, it was impo&s;|&s;ible for them to draw their &s;words. He threatened the mob with the vengeance of the Inqui&s;ition: but, in this moment of popular phren&s;y, even this dread|ful name had lo&s;t its effect. Though regret for his &s;i&s;ter made him look upon the priore&s;s with abhor|rence, Lorenzo could not help pitying a woman in a &s;ituation &s;o terrible: but in &s;pite of all his exertions and tho&s;e of the duke, of Don Ramirez, and the arch|ers, the people continued to pre&s;s onwards. They forced a pa&s;&s;age through the guards who protected their de&s;tined victim, dragged her from her &s;helter, and proceeded to take upon her a mo&s;t &s;ummary and cruel vengeance. Wild with terror, and &s;carcely knowing what &s;he &s;aid, the wretched woman &s;hrieked for a moment's mercy: &s;he prote&s;ted that &s;he was in|nocent of the death of Agnes, and could clear her&s;elf from the &s;u&s;picion beyond the power of doubt. The rioters heeded nothing but the gratification of their bar|barous vengeance. They refu&s;ed to li&s;ten to her: they &s;hewed her every &s;ort of in&s;ult, loaded her with mud and filth, and called her by the mo&s;t opprobrious appellations. They tore her one from another, and
<PB N="157" REF="035729_0412_10065B1194519960">
each new tormentor was more &s;avage than the former. They &s;tifled with howls and execrations her &s;hrill cries for mercy, and dragged her through the &s;treets, &s;purning her, trampling her, and treating her with every &s;pecies of cruelty which hate or vindictive fury could invent. At length a flint, aimed by &s;ome well directing hand, &s;truck her full upon the temple. She &s;unk upon the ground, bathed in blood, and in a few minutes terminated her mi&s;erable exi&s;tence. Yet though &s;he no longer felt their in&s;ults, the rioters &s;till exerci&s;ed their impotent rage upon her lifele&s;s body. They beat it, trod upon it, and ill u&s;ed it, till it became no more than a ma&s;s of fle&s;h, un&s;ightly, &s;hapele&s;s, and di&s;gu&s;ting.</P>
<P>Unable to prevent this &s;hocking event. Lorenzo and his friends had beheld it with the utmo&s;t horror: but they were rou&s;ed from their compelled inactivity, on hearing that the mob were attacking the convent of St. Clare. The incen&s;ed populace confounding the innocent with the guilty, had re&s;olved to &s;acrifice all the nuns of that order to their rage, and not to leave one &s;tone of the building upon another. Alarm|ed at this intelligence, they ha&s;tened to the convent, re&s;olved to defend it if po&s;&s;ible, or at lea&s;t to re&s;cue the inhabitants from the fury of the rioters. Mo&s;t of the nuns had fled, but a few &s;till remained in their habit|ation. Their &s;ituation was truly dangerous. How|ever, as they had taken the precaution of fa&s;tening the inner gates, with this a&s;&s;i&s;tance Lorenzo hoped to re|pel the mob, till Don Ramirez &s;hould return to him with a more &s;ufficient force.</P>
<P>Having been conducted by the former di&s;turbance to the di&s;tance of &s;ome &s;treets from the convent, he did
<PB N="158" REF="035729_0413_10065B4AFB640A60">
not immediately reach it. When he arrived, the throng &s;urrounding it was &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, as to prevent his approaching the gates. In the interim, the popu|lace be&s;ieged the building with per&s;evering rage: they battered the walls, threw lighted torches in at the windows, and &s;wore that by break of day not a nun of St. Clare's order &s;hould be left alive. Lo|renzo had ju&s;t &s;ucceeded in piercing his way through the crowd, when one of the gates was forced open. The rioters poured into the interior part of the build|ing, where they exerci&s;ed their vengeance upon every thing which found it&s;elf in their pa&s;&s;age. They broke the furniture into pieces, tore down the pictures, de|&s;troyed the reliques, and in their hatred of her &s;ervant forgot all re&s;pect to the &s;aint. Some employed them|&s;elves in &s;earching out the nuns, others in pulling down parts of the convent, and others again in &s;et|ting fire to the pictures and other valuable furniture which it contained. The&s;e latter produced the mo&s;t deci&s;ive de&s;olation. Indeed the con&s;equences of their action were more &s;udden than them&s;elves had expected or wi&s;hed. The flames ri&s;ing from the burning piles caught part of the building, which, being old and dry, the conflagration &s;pread with rapidity from room to room. The walls were &s;oon &s;haken by the devour|ing element. The columns gave way, the roofs came tumbling down upon the rioters, and cru&s;hed many of them beneath their weight. Nothing was to be heard but &s;hrieks and groans. The convent was wrapped in flames, and the whole pre&s;ented a &s;cene of deva&s;tation and horror.</P>
<P>Lorenzo was &s;hocked at having been the cau&s;e, however innocent of this frightful di&s;turbance: he en|deavoured
<PB N="159" REF="035729_0414_10065B131A78D718">
to repair his fault by protecting the help|le&s;s inhabitants of the convent. He entered it with the mob, and exerted him&s;elf to repre&s;s the prevailing fury, till the &s;udden and alarming progre&s;s of the flames compelled him to provide for his own &s;afety. The people now hurried out as eagerly as they had before thronged in; but their numbers clogging up the door way, and the fire gaining upon them rapidly, many of them peri&s;hed ere they had time to effect their e&s;cape. Lorenzo's good fortune directed him to a &s;mall door in a farther ai&s;le of the chapel. The bolt was already undrawn: he opened the door, and found him&s;elf at the foot of St. Clare's &s;epulchre.</P>
<P>Here he &s;topped to breathe. The duke and &s;ome of his attendants had followed him, and thus were in &s;ecurity for the pre&s;ent. They now con&s;ulted what &s;teps they &s;hould take to e&s;cape from this &s;cene of di&s;turbance; but their deliberations were con&s;iderably interrupted by the &s;ight of volumes of fire ri&s;ing from amid&s;t the convent's ma&s;&s;y walls, by the noi&s;e of &s;ome heavy arch tumbling down in ruins, or by the min|gled &s;hrieks of the nuns and rioters, either &s;uffocating in the pre&s;s, peri&s;hing in the flames, or cru&s;hed be|neath the weight of the falling man&s;ion.</P>
<P>Lorenzo inquired, whither the wicket led? He was an&s;wered, To the garden of the Capuchins: and it was re&s;olved to explore an outlet upon that &s;ide. Accordingly the duke rai&s;ed the latch, and pa&s;&s;ed into the adjoining cemetery. The attendants followed without ceremony. Lorenzo, being the la&s;t, was al&s;o on the point of quitting the colonnade, when he &s;aw the door of the &s;epulchre opened &s;oftly. Some one
<PB N="160" REF="035729_0415_10065B4C8F31FBF0">
looked out, but on perceiving &s;trangers uttered a loud &s;hriek, &s;tarted back again, and flew down the marble &s;tairs.</P>
<P>"What can this mean?" cried Lorenzo: "Here is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> my&s;tery concealed. Follow me without de|lay!"</P>
<P>Thus &s;aying, he ha&s;tened into the &s;epulchre, and pur&s;ued the per&s;on who continued to fly before him. The duke knew not the cau&s;e of this exclamation, but, &s;uppo&s;ing that he had good rea&s;ons for it, follow|ed him without he&s;itation. The others did the &s;ame, and the whole party &s;oon arrived at the foot of the &s;tairs. The upper door having been left open, the neighbouring flames darted from above a &s;ufficient light to enable Lorenzo's catching a glance of the fugitive running through the long pa&s;&s;ages and di&s;tant vaults; but when a &s;udden turn deprived him of this a&s;&s;i&s;tance, total darkne&s;s &s;ucceeded, and he could only trace the object of his inquiry by the faint echo of re|tiring feet. The pur&s;uers were now compelled to proceed with caution: as well as they could judge, the fugitive al&s;o &s;eemed to &s;lacken pace, for they heard the &s;teps follow each other at longer intervals. They at length were bewildered by the labyrinth of pa&s;&s;ages, and di&s;per&s;ed in various directions. Carried away by his eagerne&s;s to clear up this my&s;tery, and to penetrate into which he was impelled by a movement &s;ecret and unaccountable, Lorenzo heeded not this circum&s;tance till he found him&s;elf in total &s;olitude. The noi&s;e of foot&s;teps had cea&s;ed, all was &s;ilent around, and no clue offered it&s;elf to guide him to the flying per&s;on. He &s;topped to reflect on the means mo&s;t likely to aid his pur&s;uit. He was per&s;uaded that no common
<PB N="161" REF="035729_0416_10065B14D5695E78">
cau&s;e would have induced the fugitive to &s;eek that dreary place at an hour &s;o unu&s;ual: the cry which he had heard, &s;eemed uttered in a voice of terror; and he was convinced that &s;ome my&s;tery was attached to this event. After &s;ome minutes pa&s;&s;ed in he&s;itation, he continued to proceed, feeling his way along the walls of the pa&s;&s;age. He had already pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time in this &s;low progre&s;s, when he de&s;cried a &s;park of light glimmering at a di&s;tance. Guided by this ob&s;ervation, and having drawn his &s;word, he bent his &s;teps towards the place whence the beam &s;eemed to be emitted.</P>
<P>It proceeded from the lamp which flamed before St. Clare's &s;tatue. Before it &s;tood &s;everal females, their white garments &s;treaming in the bla&s;t as it howl|ed along the vaulted dungeons. Curious to know what had brought them together in this melancholy &s;pot, Lorenzo drew near with precaution. The &s;trangers &s;eemed earne&s;tly engaged in conver&s;ation. They heard not Lorenzo's &s;teps, and he approached unob&s;erved, till he could hear their voices di&s;tinctly.</P>
<P>"I prote&s;t," continued &s;he who was &s;peaking when he arrived, and to whom the re&s;t were li&s;tening with great attention; "I prote&s;t that I &s;aw them with my own eyes. I flew down the &s;teps, they pur&s;ued me, and I e&s;caped falling into their hands with diffi|culty. Had it not been for the lamp I &s;hould never have found you."</P>
<P>"And what could bring them hither?" &s;aid another in a trembling voice; "do you think that they were looking for us?"</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="035729_0417_10065B5160C67508">
"God grant that my fears may be fal&s;e," rejoined the fir&s;t; "but I doubt they are murderers! If they di&s;cover us, we are lo&s;t! As for me, my fate is cer|tain. My affinity to the priore&s;s will be a &s;ufficient crime to condemn me; and though till now the&s;e vaults have afforded me a retreat...."</P>
<P>Here looking up, her eye fell upon Lorenzo, who had continued to approach &s;lowly.</P>
<P>"The murderers!" &s;he cried.</P>
<P>She &s;tarted away from the &s;tatue's pede&s;tal on which &s;he had been &s;eated, and attempted to e&s;cape by flight. Her companions at the &s;ame moment uttered a terrified &s;cream, while Lorenzo arre&s;ted the fugitive by the arm. Frightened and de&s;perate, &s;he &s;unk upon her knees before him.</P>
<P>"Spare me!" &s;he exclaimed; "for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, &s;pare me! I am innocent, indeed I am!"</P>
<P>While &s;he &s;poke, her voice was almo&s;t choaked with fear. The beams of the lamp darting full upon her face, which was unveiled, Lorenzo recogni&s;ed the beautiful Virginia de Villa Franca. He ha&s;tened to rai&s;e her from the ground, and be&s;ought her to take courage. He promi&s;ed to protect her from the riot|ers, a&s;&s;ured her that her retreat was &s;till a &s;ecret, and that &s;he might depend upon his readine&s;s to defend her to the la&s;t drop of his blood. During this conver&s;a|tion the nuns had thrown them&s;elves into various at|titudes: one knelt, and addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to Heaven; another hid her face in the lap of her neighbour; &s;ome li&s;tened motionle&s;s with fear to the di&s;cour&s;e of the &s;uppo&s;ed a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in; while others embraced the
<PB N="163" REF="035729_0418_10065B17A798FA68">
&s;tatue of St. Clare, and implored her protection with frantic cries. On perceiving their mi&s;take, they crowded round Lorenzo, and heaped benedictions on him by dozens. He found that on hearing the threats of the mob, and terrified by the cruelties which from the convent towers they had &s;een inflicted on the &s;upe|rior, many of the pen&s;ioners and nuns had taken re|fuge in the &s;epulchre. Among the former was to be reckoned the lovely Virginia; nearly related to the priore&s;s, &s;he had more rea&s;on than the re&s;t to dread the rioters, and now be&s;ought Lorenzo earne&s;tly not to abandon her to their rage. Her companions, mo&s;t of whom were women of noble family, made the &s;ame reque&s;t, which he readily granted: he promi&s;ed not to quit them till he had &s;een each of them &s;afe in the arms of her relations. But he advi&s;ed their deferring to quit the &s;epulchre for &s;ome time longer, when the popular fury &s;hould be &s;omewhat calmed, and the ar|rival of military force have di&s;per&s;ed the multitude.</P>
<P>"Would to God," cried Virginia, "that I were already &s;afe in my mother's embraces! How &s;ay you, Segnor? will it be long ere we may leave this place? Every moment that I pa&s;s here, I pa&s;s in tor|ture!"</P>
<P>"I hope, not long," &s;aid he; "but till you can proceed with &s;ecurity, this &s;epulchre will prove an im|penetrable a&s;ylum. Here you run no ri&s;k of a di&s;cov|ery, and I would advi&s;e your remaining quiet for the next two or three hours."</P>
<P>"Two or three hours?" exclaimed &s;i&s;ter Helena: "If I &s;tay another hour in the&s;e vaults, I &s;hall expire with fear! Not the wealth of worlds &s;hould bribe me
<PB N="164" REF="035729_0419_10065B52EA59B490">
to undergo again what I have &s;uffered &s;ince my com|ing hither. Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin! To be in this melan|choly place in the middle of night, &s;urrounded by the mouldering bodies of my decea&s;ed companions, and ex|pecting every moment to be torn in pieces by their gho&s;ts who wander about me, and complain, and groan, and wail accents that make my blood run cold..... Chri&s;t Je&s;us! It is enough to drive me to madne&s;s!"</P>
<P>"Excu&s;e me," replied Lorenzo, "if I am &s;urpri&s;|ed, that while menaced by real woes you are capable of yielding to imaginary dangers. The&s;e dangers are puerile and groundle&s;s: combat them, holy &s;i&s;ter; I have promi&s;ed to guard you from the rioters; but again&s;t the attacks of &s;uper&s;tition you mu&s;t depend for protection upon your&s;elf. The idea of gho&s;ts is ridic|ulous in the extreme; and if you continue to be &s;way|ed by ideal terrors...."</P>
<P>"Ideal?" exclaimed the nuns with one voice: "Why, we heard it our&s;elves, Segnor! Every one of us heard it! It was frequently repeated, and it &s;ound|ed every time more melancholy and deep. You will never per&s;uade me that we could all have been de|ceived. No, no; had the noi&s;e been merely created by fancy ...."</P>
<P>"Hark! hark!" interrupted Virginia, in a voice of terror; "God pre&s;erve us! There it is again!"</P>
<P>The nuns cla&s;ped their hands together, and &s;unk upon their knees. Lorenzo looked round him eager|ly, and was on the point of yielding to the fears which already had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the women. Univer&s;al &s;ilence prevailed. He examined the vault, but nothing was
<PB N="165" REF="035729_0420_10065B1AC51FB8C8">
to be &s;een. He now prepared to addre&s;s the nuns, and ridicule their childi&s;h apprehen&s;ions, when his at|tention was arre&s;ted by a deep and long drawn groan.</P>
<P>"What was that?" he cried and &s;tarted.&mdash;</P>
<P>"There, Segnor!" &s;aid Hel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">na: "Now you mu&s;t be convinced! You have heard the noi&s;e your&s;elf! Now judge whether our terrors are imaginary. Since we have been here, that groaning has been repeated almo&s;t every five minutes. Doubtle&s;s it proceeds from &s;ome &s;oul in pain who wi&s;hes to be prayed out of purgatory: but none of us dare to a&s;k it the que&s;|tion. As for me, were I to &s;ee an apparition, the fright, I am very certain, would kill me out of hand."</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;aid this, a &s;econd groan was heard yet more di&s;tinctly. The nuns cro&s;&s;ed them&s;elves, and ha&s;ten|ed to repeat their prayers again&s;t evil &s;pirits. Loren|zo li&s;tened attentively. He even thought that he could di&s;tingui&s;h &s;ounds as of one &s;peaking in com|plaint, but di&s;tance rendered them inarticulate. The noi&s;e &s;eemed to come from the mid&s;t of the &s;mall vault in which he and the nuns then were, and which a multitude of pa&s;&s;ages branching out in various direc|tions formed into a &s;ort of &s;tar. Lorenzo's curio&s;ity, which was ever awake, made him anxious to &s;olve this my&s;tery. He de&s;ired that &s;ilence might be kept. The nuns obeyed him. All was hu&s;hed till the gene|ral &s;tillne&s;s was again di&s;turbed by the groaning, which was repeated &s;everal times &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. He perceiv|ed it to be mo&s;t audible, when upon following the &s;ound he was conducted clo&s;e to the &s;hrine of St. Clare.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="035729_0421_10065B5470A94298">
"The noi&s;e comes from hence," &s;aid he, "Who&s;e is this &s;tatue?"</P>
<P>Helena, to whom he addre&s;&s;ed the que&s;tion, pau&s;ed for a moment. Suddenly &s;he clapped her hands to|gether.</P>
<P>"Aye!" cried &s;he, "it mu&s;t be &s;o. I have di&s;|covered the meaning of the&s;e groans."</P>
<P>The nuns crowded round her, and be&s;ought her ea|gerly to explain her&s;elf. She gravely replied, that for time immemorial the &s;tatue had been famous for per|forming miracles. From this &s;he inferred, that the &s;aint was concerned at the conflagration of a convent which &s;he protected, and expre&s;&s;ed her grief by audi|ble lamentations. Not having equal faith in the mi|raculous &s;aint, Lorenzo did not think this &s;olution of the my&s;tery quite &s;o &s;atisfactory, as the nuns, who &s;ub&s;cribed to it without he&s;itation. In one point 'tis true that he agreed with Helena. He &s;u&s;pected that the groans proceeded from the &s;tatue: the more he li&s;tened the more was he confirmed in this idea. He drew nearer to the image, de&s;igning to in&s;pect it more clo&s;ely: but perceiving his intention, the nuns be|&s;ought him for God's &s;ake to de&s;i&s;t, &s;ince, if he touch|ed the &s;tatue, his death was inevitable.</P>
<P>"And in what con&s;i&s;ts the danger?" &s;aid he.</P>
<P>"Mother of God! In what?" replied Helena, ever eager to relate a miraculous adventure: "If you had only heard the hundredth part of tho&s;e marvellous &s;to|ries about this &s;tatue, which the domina u&s;ed to re|count! She a&s;&s;ured us often and often, that if we only dared to lay a finger upon it, we might expect the
<PB N="167" REF="035729_0422_10065B1C4D515510">
mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences. Among other things &s;he told us, that a rob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">er having entered the&s;e vaults by night, he ob&s;erved yonder ruby, who&s;e value is ine&s;ti|mable. Do you &s;ee it Segnor? It &s;parkles upon the third finger of the hand in which &s;he holds a crown of thorns. This jewel naturally excited the villain's cu|pidity. He re&s;olved to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of it. For this purpo&s;e he a&s;cended the pede&s;tal; he &s;upported him&s;elf by gra&s;ping the &s;aint's right arm, and ex|tended his own towards the ring. What was his &s;ur|pri&s;e, when he &s;aw the &s;tatue's hand rai&s;ed in a po&s;|ture of menace, and heard her lips pronounce his eternal perdition! Penetrated with awe and con&s;ter|nation, he de&s;i&s;ted from his attempt, and prepared to quit the &s;epulchre. In this he al&s;o failed. Flight was denied him. He found it impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;engage the hand which re&s;ted upon the right arm of the &s;tatue. In vain did he &s;truggle: he remained fixed to the image, till the in&s;upportable and fiery angui&s;h which darted it&s;elf through his veins, compelled his &s;hriek|ing for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The &s;epulchre was now filled with &s;pectators. The villain confe&s;&s;ed his &s;acrilege, and was only relea&s;ed by the &s;eparation of his hand from his body. It has remained ever &s;ince fa&s;tened to the image. The robber turned hermit, and led ever after an exemplary life. But yet the &s;aint's decree was performed; and tradition &s;ays, that he continues to haunt the &s;epulchre, and implore St. Clare's pardon with groans and lamentations. Now I think of it, tho&s;e which we have ju&s;t heard, may very po&s;&s;ibly have been uttered by the gho&s;t of this &s;inner; but of this I will not be po&s;itive. All that I can &s;ay is, that &s;ince that time no one has ever dared to touch the

&s;tatue. Then do not be fool hardy, good Segnor! For the love of Heaven, give up your de&s;ign, nor ex|po&s;e your&s;elf unnece&s;&s;arily to certain de&s;truction."</P>
<P>Not being convinced that his de&s;truction would be &s;o certain as Helena &s;eemed to think it, Lorenzo per|&s;i&s;ted in his re&s;olution. The nuns be&s;ought him to de&s;i&s;t, in piteous terms, and even pointed out the rob|ber's hand, which was in effect &s;till vi&s;ible upon the arm of the &s;tatue. This proof, as they imagined, mu&s;t convince him. It was very far from doing &s;o; and they were greatly &s;candalized when he declared his &s;u&s;picion that the dried and &s;hrivelled fingers had been placed there by order of the priore&s;s. In &s;pite of their prayers and threats he approached the &s;tatue. He &s;prang over the iron rails which defended it, and the &s;aint underwent a thorough examination. The image at fir&s;t appeared to be of &s;tone, but proved on further in&s;pection to be formed of no more &s;olid ma|terials than coloured wood. He &s;hook it, and attempt|ed to move it: but it appeared to be of a piece with the ba&s;e which it &s;tood upon. He examined it over and over: &s;till no clue guided him to the &s;olution of this my&s;tery, for which the nuns were become equally &s;olic|itous, when they &s;aw that he touched the &s;tatue with impunity. He pau&s;ed, and li&s;tened: the groans were repeated at intervals, and he was convinced of being in the &s;pot neare&s;t to them. He mu&s;ed upon this &s;ingu|lar event, and ran over the &s;tatue with inquiring eyes. Suddenly they re&s;ted upon the &s;hrivelled hand. It &s;truck him that &s;o particular an injunction was not given without cau&s;e, not to touch the arm of the im|age. He again a&s;cended the pede&s;tal: he examined the object of his attention, and di&s;covered a &s;mall knob
<PB N="169" REF="035729_0424_10065B1DF8E60270">
of iron concealed between the &s;aint's &s;houlder and what was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the hand of the rob|ber. This ob&s;ervation delighted him. He applied his fingers to the knob, and pre&s;&s;ed it down forcibly. Immediately a rumbling noi&s;e was heard within the &s;tatue, as if a chain tightly &s;tretched was flying back. Startled at the &s;ound, the timid nuns &s;tarted away, pre|pared to ha&s;ten from the vault at the fir&s;t appearance of danger. All remaining quiet and &s;till, they again gathered round Lorenzo, and beheld his proceedings with anxious curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>Finding that nothing followed this di&s;covery, he de|&s;cended. As he took his hand from the &s;aint, &s;he trembled beneath his touch. This created new ter|rors in the &s;pectators, who believed the &s;tatue to be animated. Lorenzo's ideas upon the &s;ubject were widely different. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e ea&s;ily comprehended, that the noi&s;e which he had heard was occa&s;ioned by his hav|ing loo&s;ened a chain which attached the image to its pede&s;tal. He once more attempted to move it, and &s;ucceeded without much exertion. He placed it upon the ground, and then perceived the pede&s;tal to be hol|low, and covered at the opening with an heavy iron grate.</P>
<P>This excited &s;uch general curio&s;ity, that the &s;i&s;ters forgot both their real and imaginary dangers. Loren|zo proceeded to rai&s;e the grate, in which the nuns a&s;|&s;i&s;ted him to the utmo&s;t of their &s;trength. The at|tempt was accompli&s;hed with little difficulty. A deep aby&s;s now pre&s;ented it&s;elf before them, who&s;e thick ob&s;curity the eye &s;trove in vain to pierce. The rays of the lamp were too feeble to be of much a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Nothing was di&s;cernible, &s;ave a flight of rough un|&s;hapen
<PB N="170" REF="035729_0425_10065B5B0EAF79C8">
&s;teps, which &s;unk into the yawning gulph, and were &s;oon lo&s;t in darkne&s;s. The groans were heard no more: but all believed them to have a&s;cended from this cavern. As he bent over it, Lorenzo fancied that he di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;omething bright twinkling through the gloom. He gazed attentively upon the &s;pot where it &s;howed it&s;elf, and was convinced that he &s;aw a &s;mall &s;park of light, now vi&s;ible, now di&s;ap|pearing. He communicated this circum&s;tance to the nuns: they al&s;o perceived the &s;park: but when he declared his intention to de&s;cend into the cave, they united to oppo&s;e his re&s;olution. All their remon&s;trances could not prevail on him to alter it. None of them had courage enough to accompany him; neither could he think of depriving them of the lamp. Alone, there|fore, and in darkne&s;s, he prepared to pur&s;ue his de&s;ign, while the nuns were contented to offer up prayers for his &s;ucce&s;s and &s;afety.</P>
<P>The &s;teps were &s;o narrow and uneven, that to de|&s;cend them was like walking down the &s;ide of a preci|pice. The ob&s;curity by which he was &s;urrounded, rendered his footing in&s;ecure. He was obliged to pro|ceed with great caution, le&s;t he &s;hould mi&s;s the &s;teps and fall into the gulph below him. This he was &s;ev|eral times on the point of doing. However, he ar|rived &s;ooner upon &s;olid ground than he had expect|ed. He now found that the thick darkne&s;s and im|penetrable mi&s;ts which reigned through the cavern, had deceived him into the belief of its being much more profound than it proved upon in&s;pection. He reached the foot of the &s;tairs unhurt: he now &s;topped, and looked round for the &s;park, which had before caught his attention. He &s;ought it in vain: all was
<PB N="171" REF="035729_0426_10065B220B274D08">
dark and gloomy. He li&s;tened for the groans; but his ear caught no &s;ound except the di&s;tant murmur of the nuns above, as in low voices they repeated their ave marias. He &s;tood irre&s;olute to which &s;ide be &s;hould addre&s;s his &s;teps. At all events, he determined to pro|ceed: he did &s;o, but &s;lowly, fearful le&s;t, in&s;tead of ap|proaching, he &s;hould be retiring from the object of his &s;earch. The groans &s;eemed to announce one in pain, or at lea&s;t in &s;orrow, and he hoped to have the power of relieving the mourner's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. A plaintive tone, &s;ounding at no great di&s;tance, at length reached his hearing: he bent his cour&s;e joyfully towards it. It became more audible as he advanced; and he &s;oon beheld again the &s;park of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, which a low project|ing wall had hitherto concealed from him.</P>
<P>It proceeded from a &s;mall lamp which was placed upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n heap of &s;tones, and who&s;e faint and melan|choly rays &s;erved rather to point out than di&s;pel the horrors of a narrow gloomy dungeon, formed in one &s;ide of the cavern: it al&s;o &s;howed &s;everal other rece&s;&s;es of &s;imilar con&s;truction, but who&s;e depth was buried in ob&s;curity. Coldly played the light upon the damp walls, who&s;e dew-&s;tained &s;urface gave back a feeble reflection. A thick and pe&s;tilen|tial fog clouded the height of the vaulted dungeon. As Lorenzo advanced, he felt a piercing chillne&s;s &s;pread it&s;elf through his veins. The frequent groans &s;till en|gaged him to move forwards. He turned towards them, and by the lamp's glimmering beams beheld in a corner of this loath&s;ome abode, a creature &s;tretch|ed upon a bed of &s;traw, &s;o wretched, &s;o emaciated, &s;o pale, that he doubted to think her woman. She was half naked: her long di&s;hevelled hair fell in di&s;order
<PB N="172" REF="035729_0427_10065B5C96B4C650">
over her face, and almo&s;t entirely concealed it. One wa&s;ted arm hung li&s;tle&s;sly upon a tattered rug, which covered her convul&s;ed and &s;hivering limbs: the other was wrapped round a &s;mall bundle, and held it clo&s;ely to her bo&s;om. A large ro&s;ary lay near her: oppo&s;ite to her was a crucifix, on which &s;he bent her &s;unk eyes fixedly, and by her &s;ide &s;tood a ba&s;ket and a &s;mall earthen pitcher.</P>
<P>Lorenzo &s;topped: he was petrified with horror. He gazed upon the mi&s;erable object with di&s;gu&s;t and pity. He trembled at the &s;pectacle: he grew &s;ick at heart: his &s;trength failed him, and his limbs were unable to &s;upport his weight. He was obliged to lean again&s;t the low wall which was near him, unable to go forward or to addre&s;s the &s;ufferer. She ca&s;t her eyes towards the &s;tairca&s;e: the wall concealed Loren|zo, and &s;he ob&s;erved him not.</P>
<P>"No one comes!" &s;he at length murmured.</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;poke, her voice was hollow, and rattled in her throat: &s;he &s;ighed bitterly.</P>
<P>"No one comes!" &s;he repeated: "no! they have forgotten me! they will come no more!"</P>
<P>She pau&s;ed for a moment; then continued mourn|fully:</P>
<P>"Two days! two long, long days, and yet no food! and yet no hope, no comfort! Fooli&s;h woman! how can I wi&s;h to lengthen a life &s;o wretched!&mdash;Yet &s;uch a death! O God! to peri&s;h by &s;uch a death! to lin|ger out &s;uch ages in torture! Till now, I knew not what it was to hunger!&mdash;Hark!&mdash;No! no one comes&punc; they will come no more."</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="035729_0428_10065B239224AF10">
She was &s;ilent. She &s;hivered, and drew the rug over her naked &s;houlders:</P>
<P>"I am very cold: I am &s;till unu&s;ed to the damps of this dungeon: 'tis &s;trange: but no matter. Colder &s;hall I &s;oon be, and yet not feel it. I &s;hall be cold, cold as thou art."</P>
<P>She looked at the bundle, which lay upon her brea&s;t. She bent over it, and ki&s;&s;ed it; then drew back ha&s;t|ily, and &s;huddered with di&s;gu&s;t:</P>
<P>"It was once &s;o &s;weet! It would have been &s;o lovely, &s;o like him! I have lo&s;t it for ever. How a few days have changed it! I &s;hould not know it again my&s;elf! Yet it is dear to me. God! how dear!&mdash;I will forget what it is! I will only remem|ber what it was, and love it as well as when it was &s;o &s;weet! &s;o lovely! &s;o like him!&mdash;I thought that I had wept away all my tears, but here is our &s;till lingering."</P>
<P>She wiped her eyes with a tre&s;s of her hair. She put out her hand for the pitcher, and reached it with difficulty. She ca&s;t into it a look of hopele&s;s inquiry. She &s;ighed, and replaced it upon the ground.</P>
<P>"Quite a void!&mdash;Not a drop!&mdash;Not one drop left to cool my &s;corched up burning palate!&mdash;Now would I give trea&s;ures for a draught of water!&mdash;And they are God's &s;ervants who make me &s;uffer thus!&mdash;They think them&s;elves holy, while they torture me like fiends!&mdash;They are cruel and unfeeling; and 'tis they who bid me repent; and 'tis they who threaten me with eternal perdition! Saviour, Saviour! you think not &s;o!"</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="035729_0429_10065B5E1DF68840">
She again fixed her eyes upon the crucifix, took her ro&s;ary, and, while &s;he told her beads, the quick mo|tion of her lips declared her to be praying with fer|vency.</P>
<P>While he li&s;tened to her melancholy accents, Lo|renzo's &s;en&s;ibility became yet more violently affected. The fir&s;t &s;ight of &s;uch mi&s;ery had given a &s;en&s;ible &s;hock to his feelings: but that being pa&s;t, he now ad|vanced towards the captive. She heard his &s;teps, and, uttering a cry of joy, dropped the ro&s;ary.</P>
<P>"Hark! hark! hark!" &s;he cried, "&s;ome one comes!"</P>
<P>She &s;trove to rai&s;e her&s;elf, but her &s;trength was une|qual to the attempt; &s;he fell back, and, as &s;he &s;unk again upon the bed of &s;traw, Lorenzo heard the rat|tling of heavy chains. He &s;till approached, while the pri&s;oner thus continued:</P>
<P>"Is it you, Camilla? You are come then at la&s;t? Oh! it was time! I thought that you had for&s;aken me; that I was doomed to peri&s;h of hunger. Give me to drink, Camilla, for pity's &s;ake; I am faint with long fa&s;ting, and grown &s;o weak that I cannot rai&s;e my&s;elf from the ground. Good Camilla, give me to drink, le&s;t I expire before you."</P>
<P>Fearing that &s;urpri&s;e in her enfeebled &s;tate might be fatal, Lorenzo was at a lo&s;s how to addre&s;s her.</P>
<P>"It is not Camilla," &s;aid he at length, &s;peaking in a low and gentle voice.</P>
<P>"Who is it then?" replied the &s;ufferer; "Alix, perhaps, or Violante. My eyes are grown &s;o dim and
<PB N="175" REF="035729_0430_10065B259CF27A08">
feeble, that I cannot di&s;tingui&s;h your features; but whichever it is, if your brea&s;t is &s;en&s;ible of the lea&s;t compa&s;&s;ion, if you are not more cruel than wolves and tigers, take pity on my &s;ufferings. You know that I am dying for want of &s;u&s;tenance. This is the third day &s;ince the&s;e lips have received nouri&s;hment. Do you bring me food? Or come you only to an|nounce my death, and learn how long I have yet to exi&s;t in agony?"</P>
<P>"You mi&s;take my bu&s;ine&s;s," replied Lorenzo; "I am no emi&s;&s;ary of the cruel priore&s;s. I pity your &s;or|rows, and come hither to relieve them."</P>
<P>"To relieve them?" repeated the captive; "&s;aid you to relieve them?"</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time &s;tarting from the ground, and &s;upporting her&s;elf upon her hands, &s;he gazed upon the &s;tranger earne&s;tly.</P>
<P>"Great God!&mdash;Is it no illu&s;ion?&mdash;A man? Speak! Who are you? What brings you hither? Come you to &s;ave me, to re&s;tore me to liberty, to life and light? Oh! &s;peak, &s;peak quickly, le&s;t I encour|age an hope who&s;e di&s;appointment will de&s;troy me."</P>
<P>"Be calm!" replied Lorenzo, in a voice &s;oothing and compa&s;&s;ionate; "the domina of who&s;e cruelty you complain, has already paid the forfeit of her of|fences: you have nothing more to fear from her. A few minutes will re&s;tore you to liberty and the embra|ces of your friends, from whom you have been &s;eclud|ed. You may rely upon my protection. Give me your hand, and be not fearful. Let me conduct you
<PB N="176" REF="035729_0431_10065B2740EBCB48">
where you may receive tho&s;e attentions which your feeble &s;tate requires."</P>
<P>"Oh! yes! yes! yes!" cried the pri&s;oner with an exulting &s;hriek; "there is a God then, and a ju&s;t one! Joy! Joy! I &s;hall once more breathe the fre&s;h air, and view the light of the glorious &s;unbeams! I will go with you! Stranger, I will go with you! Oh! Heaven will ble&s;s you for pitying an unfortunate! But this too mu&s;t go with me," &s;he added, pointing to the &s;mall bundle, which &s;he &s;till cla&s;ped to her bo&s;om; "I cannot part with this. I will bear it away: it &s;hall convince the world how dreadful are the abodes &s;o fal&s;ely termed religious. Good &s;tranger! lend me your hand to ri&s;e: I am faint with want, and &s;orrow, and &s;ickne&s;s, and my &s;trength has quite for&s;aken me! So, that is well!"</P>
<P>As Lorenzo &s;tooped to rai&s;e her, the beams of the lamp &s;truck full upon his face.</P>
<P>"Almighty God!" &s;he exclaimed: "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it po&s;&s;i|ble?&mdash;That look! tho&s;e features!&mdash;Oh! yes, it is, it is....."</P>
<P>She extended her arms to throw them round him, but her enfeebled frame was unable to &s;u&s;tain the emotions which agitated her bo&s;om. She fainted, and again &s;unk upon the bed of &s;traw.</P>
<P>Lorenzo was &s;urpri&s;ed at her la&s;t exclamation. He thought that he had before heard &s;uch accents as her hollow voice had ju&s;t formed, but where, he could not remember. He &s;aw that in her dangerous &s;ituation immediate phy&s;ical aid was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and he ha&s;tened to convey her from the dungeon. He
<PB N="177" REF="035729_0432_100834F2DFACCB90">
was at fir&s;t prevented from doing &s;o by a &s;trong chain fa&s;tened round the pri&s;oner's body, and fixing her to the neighbouring wall. However, his natural &s;trength being aided by anxiety to relieve the unfortunate, he &s;oon forced out the &s;taple, to which one end of the chain was attached: then taking the captive in his arms, he bent his cour&s;e towards the &s;tairca&s;e. The rays of the lamp above, as well as the murmur of fe|male voices, guided his &s;teps. He gained the &s;tairs, and in a few minutes after arrived at the iron grate.</P>
<P>The nuns during his ab&s;ence had been terribly tor|mented by curio&s;ity and apprehen&s;ion. They were equally &s;urpri&s;ed and delighted on &s;eeing him &s;udden|ly emerge from the cave. Every heart was filled with compa&s;&s;ion for the mi&s;erable creature, whom he bore in his arms. While the nuns, and Virginia in par|ticular, employed them&s;elves in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to recal her to her &s;en&s;es, Lorenzo related in a few words the man|ner of his finding her. He then ob&s;erved to them, that by this time the tumult mu&s;t have been quelled, and that he could now conduct them to their friends without danger. All were eager to quit the &s;epul|chre. Still, to prevent all po&s;&s;ibility of ill u&s;age, they be&s;ought Lorenzo to venture out fir&s;t alone, and ex|amine whether the coa&s;t was clear. With this re|que&s;t he complied. Helena offered to conduct them to the &s;tairca&s;e, and they were on the point of depart|ing when a &s;trong light fla&s;hed from &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages upon the adjacent walls. At the &s;ame time &s;teps were heard of people approaching ha&s;tily, and who&s;e number &s;eemed to be con&s;iderable. The nuns were greatly alarmed at this circum&s;tance; they &s;uppo&s;ed their retreat to be di&s;covered, and the rioters to be ad|vancing
<PB N="178" REF="035729_0433_10065B60008D4BE0">
in pur&s;uit of them. Ha&s;tily quitting the pri&s;oner, who remained in&s;en&s;ible, they crowded round Lorenzo, and claimed his promi&s;e to protect them. Virginia alone forgot her own danger by &s;triving to relieve the &s;orrows of another. She &s;up|ported the &s;ufferer's head upon her knees, bathing her temples with ro&s;e water, cha&s;ing her cold hands, and &s;prinkling her face with tears which were drawn from her by compa&s;&s;ion. The &s;trangers approaching nearer, Lorenzo was enabled to di&s;pel the fears of the &s;uppliants. His name pronounced by a number of voices, among which he di&s;tingui&s;hed the duke's, pealed along the vaults, and convinced him that he was the object of their &s;earch. He communicated this intel|ligence to the nuns, who received it with rapture. A few moments after confirmed this idea. Don Ra|mirez as well as the duke appeared, followed by at|tendants with torches. They had been &s;eeking him through the vaults, in order to let him know that the mob was di&s;per&s;ed, and the riot entirely over. Lo|renzo recounted briefly his adventure in the cavern, and explained how much the unknown was in want of medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He be&s;ought the duke to take charge of her, as well as of the nuns and pen&s;ioners.</P>
<P>"As for me," &s;aid he, "other cares demand my attention. While you with one half of the archers convey the&s;e ladies to their re&s;pective homes, I wi&s;h the other half to be left with me. I will examine the cavern below, and pervade the mo&s;t &s;ecret rece&s;&s;es of the &s;epulchre. I cannot re&s;t till convinced that yonder wretched victim was the only one confined by &s;uper&s;tition in the&s;e vaults."</P>
<P>The duke applauded his intention. Don Ramirez
<PB N="179" REF="035729_0434_10065B28DD105690">
offered to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his inquiry, and his propo&s;al was accepted with gratitude. The nuns, having made their acknowledgments to Lorenzo, committed them&s;elves to the care of his uncle, and were conduct|ed from the &s;epulchre. Virginia reque&s;ted that the unknown might be given to her in charge, and prom|i&s;ed to let Lorenzo know, whenever &s;he was &s;uffi|ciently recovered to accept his vi&s;its. In truth &s;he made this promi&s;e more from con&s;ideration for her&s;elf, than for either Lorenzo or the captive. She had wit|ne&s;&s;ed his politene&s;s, gentlene&s;s, and intrepidity with &s;en&s;ible emotion. She wi&s;hed earne&s;tly to pre&s;erve his acquaintance; and in addition to the &s;entiments of pity which the pri&s;oner excited, &s;he hoped that her attention to this unfortunate would rai&s;e her a degree in the e&s;teem of Lorenzo. She had no occa&s;ion to trouble her&s;elf upon this head. The kindne&s;s already di&s;played by her, and the tender concern which &s;he had &s;hewn for the &s;ufferer, had gained her an exalted place in his good graces. While occupied in alleviating the captive's &s;orrows, the nature of her employment adorned her with new charms, and rendered her beauty a thou&s;and times more intere&s;ting. Lorenzo viewed her with admiration and delight: he con&s;id|ered her as a mini&s;tering angel de&s;cended to the aid of afflicted innocence; nor could his heart have re&s;i&s;ted her attractions, had it not been &s;teeled by the remem|brance of Antonia.</P>
<P>The duke now conveyed the nuns in &s;afety to the dwellings of their re&s;pective friends. The re&s;cued pri&s;oner was &s;till in&s;en&s;ible, and gave no &s;igns of life, except by occa&s;ional groans. She was borne upon a &s;ort of litter. Virginia, who was con&s;tantly by the

&s;ide of it, was apprehen&s;ive that, exhau&s;ted by long ab|&s;tinence, and &s;haken by the &s;udden change from bonds and darkne&s;s to liberty and light, her frame would never get the better of the &s;hock. Lorenzo and Don Ramirez &s;till remained in the &s;epulchre. After delib|erating upon their proceedings, it was re&s;olved that, to prevent lo&s;ing time, the archers &s;hould be divided into two bodies: that with one, Don Ramirez &s;hould ex|amine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> cavern, while Lorenzo, with the other, might penetrate into the further vaults. This being arranged, and his followers being provided with torches, Don Ramirez advanced to the cavern. He had already de&s;cended &s;ome &s;teps, when he heard peo|ple approaching ha&s;tily from the interior part of the &s;epulchre. This &s;urpri&s;ed him, and he quitted the cave precipitately.</P>
<P>"Do you hear foot&s;teps?" &s;aid Lorenzo. "Let us bend our cour&s;e towards them. 'Tis from this &s;ide that they &s;eem to proceed."</P>
<P>At that moment a loud and piercing &s;hriek induced him to quicken his &s;teps.</P>
<P>"Help! help, for God's &s;ake!" cried a voice, who&s;e melodious tone penetrated Lorenzo's heart with terror.</P>

<P>ALL this while Ambro&s;io was uncon&s;cious of the dreadful &s;cenes which were pa&s;&s;ing &s;o near. The execution of his de&s;igns upon Antonia employed his every thought. Hitherto he was &s;atisfied with the &s;ucce&s;s of his plans. Antonia had drank the opiate, was buried in the vaults of St. Clare, and ab&s;olutely in his di&s;po&s;al. Matilda, who was well acquainted with the nature and effects of the &s;oporific medicine, had computed that it would not cea&s;e to operate till one in the morning. For that hour he waited with impa|tience. The fe&s;tival of St. Clare pre&s;ented him with a favourable opportunity of con&s;ummating his crime. He was certain that the friars and nuns would be en|gaged in the proce&s;&s;ion, and that he had no cau&s;e to dread an interruption <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> him&s;elf at the head of the monks, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed. He doubted not&punc; that being beyond the reach of help, cut off from all the world, and totally in his power, An|tonia would fall an ea&s;y victim to his villainy. The affection which he had ever expre&s;&s;ed for him, war|ranted this per&s;ua&s;ion: but he re&s;olved, that, &s;hould
<PB N="182" REF="035729_0437_10065B6658A70130">
&s;he prove ob&s;tinate, no con&s;ideration whatever &s;hould be permitted to counteract his plans. Secure from a di&s;covery, he &s;huddered not at the idea of employing force; or, if he felt any repugnance, it aro&s;e not from a principle of &s;hame or compa&s;&s;ion, but from his feeling for Antonia the mo&s;t &s;incere and ardent affection.</P>
<P>The monks quitted the abbey at midnight. Ma|tilda was among the chori&s;ters, and led the chant. Ambro&s;io was left by him&s;elf, and at liberty to pur&s;ue his own inclinations. Convinced that no one re|mained behind to watch his motions, or di&s;turb his plea&s;ures, he now ha&s;tened to the we&s;tern ai&s;les. His heart beating with hope, not unmingled with anxiety, he cro&s;&s;ed the garden, unlocked the door which admit|ted him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the cemetery, and in a few minutes he &s;tood before the vaults. Here he pau&s;ed: he looked round him with &s;u&s;picion, con&s;cious that his bu&s;ine&s;s was unfit for any other eye. As he &s;tood in he&s;itation, he heard the melancholy &s;hriek of the &s;creech owl: the wind rattled loudly again&s;t the windows of the adja|cent convent, and, as the current &s;wept by him, bore with it the faint notes of the chant of chori&s;ters. He opened the door cautiou&s;ly, as if fearing to be over|heard; he entered, and clo&s;ed it again after him. Guided by his lamp, he threaded the long pa&s;&s;ages, in who&s;e windings Matilda had in&s;tructed him, and reached the private vault which contained his &s;leeping mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Its entrance was by no means ea&s;y to di&s;cover; but this was no ob&s;tacle to Ambro&s;io, who at the time of Antonia's funeral had ob&s;erved it too carefully to be
<PB N="183" REF="035729_0438_10065B2EF15A3378">
deceived. He found the door, which was unfa&s;tened, pu&s;hed it open, and de&s;cended into the dungeon. He approached the humble tomb in which Antonia repo&s;|ed. He had provided him&s;elf with an iron crow and a pickaxe: but this precaution was unnece&s;&s;ary. The grate was &s;lightly fa&s;tened on the out&s;ide: he rai&s;ed it, and, placing the lamp upon its ridge, bent &s;ilently over the tomb. By the &s;ide of three putrid half corrupted bodies lay the &s;leeping beauty. A lively red, the forerunner of returning animation, had already &s;pread it&s;elf over her cheeks; and as wrapped in her &s;hroud &s;he reclined upon her funeral bier, &s;he &s;eemed to &s;mile at the images of death around her. While he gazed upon the rotting bones and di&s;gu&s;ting figures, who perhaps were once as &s;weet and lovely, Ambro&s;io thought upon Elvira, by him reduced to the &s;ame &s;tate. As the memory of that horrid act glanced upon his mind, it was clouded with a gloomy horror; yet it &s;erved but to &s;trengthen his re&s;olution to de&s;troy Antonia's honor.</P>
<P>"For your &s;ake, fatal beauty!" murmured the monk while gazing on his devoted prey, "for your &s;ake have I committed this murder, and &s;old my&s;elf to eternal tortures. Now you are in my power: the produce of my guilt will at lea&s;t be mine. Hope not that your prayers breathed in tones of unequalled melody, your bright eyes filled with tears, and your hands lifted in &s;upplication, as when &s;eeking in peni|tence the Virgin's pardon: hope not that your mov|ing innocence, your beauteous grief, or all your &s;up|pliant arts, &s;hall ran&s;om you from my embraces. Before the break of day, mine you mu&s;t, and mine you &s;hall be!"</P>

"Antonia! wretched Antonia! Too &s;oon were the villain's words verified. Heaven, for purpo&s;es no doubt wi&s;e in them&s;elves, but who&s;e aim the &s;ight of mortals is too weak to di&s;cern, interpo&s;ed not in the unhappy girl's behalf. Animation was only re&s;tored to make her &s;en&s;ible that the monk was a villain, and her&s;elf undone!</P>
<P>Scarcely had he &s;ucceeded in his de&s;ign, when he &s;huddered at him&s;elf, and the means by which it was effected. The very exce&s;s of his former pa&s;&s;ion for Antonia now contributed to in&s;pire him with di&s;gu&s;t; and a &s;ecret impul&s;e made him feel how ba&s;e and un|manly was the crime which he had ju&s;t committed. He &s;tarted ha&s;tily from her. She, who &s;o lately had been the object of his adoration, now rai&s;ed no other &s;entiment in his heart than aver&s;ion and rage. He turned away from her; or, if his eyes re&s;ted upon her figure involuntarily, it was only to dart upon her looks of hate. The unfortunate remained &s;tretched upon the earth in &s;ilent de&s;pair; the tears cha&s;ed each other &s;lowly down her cheeks, and her bo&s;om heaved with frequent &s;obs. Oppre&s;&s;ed with grief, &s;he con|tinued for &s;ome time in this &s;tate of torpidity. At length &s;he ro&s;e with difficulty, and dragging her feeble &s;teps towards the door, prepared to quit the dungeon.</P>
<P>The &s;ound of her foot&s;teps rou&s;ed the monk from his &s;ullen apathy. Starting from the tomb, again&s;t which he reclined, while his eyes wandered over the images of corruption contained in it, he pur&s;ued the victim of his brutality, and &s;oon overtook her. He &s;eized her by the arm, and violently forced her back into the dungeon.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="035729_0440_10065B67DF33E658">
"Whither go you?" he cried in a &s;tern voice; "return this in&s;tant!"</P>
<P>Antonia trembled at the fury of his countenance.</P>
<P>"What would you more?" &s;he &s;aid with timidity: "Is not my ruin completed? Am I not undone, un|done for ever? Is not your cruelty contented, or have I yet more to &s;uffer? Let me depart, let me return to my home, and weep unre&s;trained my &s;hame and my affliction!"</P>
<P>"Return to your home?" repeated the monk, with bitter and contemptuous mockery; then &s;uddenly his eyes flaming with pa&s;&s;ion, "What? that you may de|nounce me to the world? that you may proclaim me a hypocrite, a betrayer, a mon&s;ter of cruelty, lu&s;t and ingratitude? No, no, no! I know well the whole weight of my offences; well, that your complaints would be too ju&s;t, and my crimes too notorious! You &s;hall not from hence to tell Madrid that I am a vil|lain; that my con&s;cience is loaded with &s;ins, which make me de&s;pair of Heaven's pardon. Wretched girl, you mu&s;t &s;tay here with me!

What &s;educed me into crimes, who&s;e bare re|membrance makes me &s;hudder? Fatal witch! was it not thy beauty? Have you not plunged my &s;oul in &s;hame? Nay, at this moment, does not that angel look bid me de&s;pair of God's forgivene&s;s? Oh! when I &s;tand before his judgment throne, that look will &s;uffice

And 'tis you who will accu&s;e me! 'tis you who will cau&s;e my eternal angui&s;h!&mdash;you, wretched girl! you! you!"</P>
<P>As he thundered out the&s;e words, he violently gra&s;p|ed Antonia's arm, and &s;purned the earth with deliri|ous fury.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing his brain to be turned, Antonia &s;unk in terror upon her knees; &s;he lifted up her hands, and her voice almo&s;t died away ere &s;he could give it utter|ance.</P>
<P>"Spare me! &s;pare me!" &s;he murmured with diffi|culty.</P>
<P>"Silence!" cried the friar madly, and da&s;hed her upon the ground&mdash;</P>
<P>He quitted her, and paced the dungeon with a wild and di&s;ordered air. His eyes rolled fearfully; Anto|nia trembled whenever &s;he met their gaze. He &s;eem|ed to meditate on &s;omething horrible, and &s;he gave up all hopes of e&s;caping from the &s;epulchre with life. Yet in harbouring this idea &s;he did him inju&s;tice.
<PB N="187" REF="035729_0442_10065B309DE4F828">
Amid&s;t the horror and di&s;gu&s;t to which his &s;oul was a prey, pity for his victim &s;till held a place in it. The &s;torm of pa&s;&s;ion once over, he would have given worlds had he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them, to have re&s;tored to her that in|nocence of which his unbridled pa&s;&s;ions had deprived her. Of the de&s;ires which had urged him to the crime, no trace was left in his bo&s;om: his nature &s;eemed to revolt at their very idea, and fain would he have wiped from his memory the &s;cene which had ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed. As his gloomy rage abated, in proportion did his compa&s;&s;ion augment for Antonia. He &s;topped, and would have &s;poken to her words of comfort; but he knew not from whence to draw them, and remain|ed gazing upon her with mournful wildne&s;s. Her &s;ituation &s;eemed &s;o hopele&s;s, &s;o woe begone, as to baffle mortal power to relieve her. What could he do for her? Her peace of mind was lo&s;t, her honor irreparably ruined. She was cut off for ever from &s;o|ciety, nor dared he give her back to it. He was con&s;cious that, were &s;he to appear in the world again, his guilt would be revealed, and his puni&s;hment inevit|able. To one &s;o laden with crimes, death came armed with double terrors. Yet, &s;hould he re&s;tore Antonia to light, and &s;tand the chance of her betray|ing him, how mi&s;erable a pro&s;pect would pre&s;ent it&s;elf before her! She could never hope to be creditably e&s;|tabli&s;hed; &s;he would be marked with infamy, and condemned to &s;orrow and &s;olitude for the remainder of her exi&s;tence. What was the alternative? A re&s;o|lution far more terrible for Antonia, but which at lea&s;t would en&s;ure the abbot's &s;afety. He determined to leave the world per&s;uaded of her death, and to retain her a captive in this gloomy pri&s;on. There he pro|po&s;ed
<PB N="188" REF="035729_0443_10065B6B624AB790">
to vi&s;it her every night, to bring her food, to profe&s;s his penitence, and mingle his tears with hers. The monk felt that this re&s;olution was unju&s;t and cruel; but it was his only means to prevent Anto|nia from publi&s;hing his guilt and her own infamy. Should he relea&s;e her, he could not depend upon her &s;ilence. His offence was too flagrant to permit his hoping for her forgivene&s;s. Be&s;ides, her reappearing would excite univer&s;al curio&s;ity, and the violence of her affliction would prevent her from concealing its cau&s;e. He determined, therefore, that Antonia &s;hould remain a pri&s;oner in the dungeon.</P>
<P>He approached her with confu&s;ion painted on his countenance. He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">i&s;ed her from the ground&mdash;her hand trembled as he took it, and he dropped it again as if he had touched a &s;erpent. Nature &s;eemed to re|coil at the touch. He felt him&s;elf at once repul&s;|ed from and attracted towards her, yet could ac|count for neither &s;entiment. There was &s;omething in her look which penetrated him with horror; and though his under&s;tanding was &s;till ignorant of it, con|&s;cience pointed out to him the whole extent of his crime. In hurried accents, yet the gentle&s;t he could find, while his eye was averted, and his voice &s;carcely audible, he &s;trove to con&s;ole her under a misfortune which now could not be avoided. He declared him|&s;elf &s;incerely penitent, and that he would gladly &s;hed a drop of his blood for every tear which his barbarity had forced from her. Wretched and hopele&s;s, Anto|nia li&s;tened to him in &s;ilent grief; but when he an|nounced her confinement in the &s;epulchre, that dread|ful doom, to which even death &s;eemed preferable, rou&s;ed her from her in&s;en&s;ibility at once. To linger
<PB N="189" REF="035729_0444_10065B32468C1A08">
out a life of mi&s;ery in a narrow loath&s;ome cell, know to exi&s;t by no human being &s;ave her betrayer, &s;ur|rounded by mouldering cor&s;es, breathing the pe&s;tilen|tial air of corruption, never more to behold the light, or drink the pure gale of heaven&mdash;the idea was more terrible than &s;he could &s;upport. It conquered even her abhorrence of the friar. Again &s;he &s;unk upon her knees; &s;he be&s;ought his compa&s;&s;ion in terms the mo&s;t pathetic and urgent: &s;he promi&s;ed, would he but re&s;tore her to liberty, to conceal her injuries from the world; to a&s;&s;ign any rea&s;ons for her reappearance, which he might judge proper; and, in order to pre|vent the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion from falling upon him, &s;he of|fered to quit Madrid immediately. Her entreaties were &s;o urgent as to make a con&s;iderable impre&s;&s;ion upon the monk. He reflected, that in keeping her concealed as he had at fir&s;t intended, he was adding a fre&s;h injury to tho&s;e which &s;he had already &s;uffered; and that if &s;he adhered to her promi&s;es, whether &s;he was confined or at liberty, his life and reputation were equally &s;ecure. On the other hand, he trembled le&s;t in her affliction Antonia &s;hould unintentionally break her engagement, or that her exce&s;&s;ive &s;implicity and ignorance of deceit &s;hould permit &s;ome one more artful to &s;urpri&s;e her &s;ecret. However well founded were the&s;e apprehen&s;ions, compa&s;&s;ion, and a &s;incere wi&s;h to repair his fault as much as po&s;&s;ible, &s;olicited his complying with the prayers of his &s;uppliant. The difficulty of colouring Antonia's unexpected return to life, after her &s;uppo&s;ed death and public interment, was the only point which kept him irre&s;olute. He was &s;till pondering on the means of removing this ob|&s;tacle, when he heard the &s;ound of feet approaching with precipitation. The door of the vault was thrown

open, and Matilda ru&s;hed in, evidently much confu&s;ed and terrified.</P>
<P>On &s;eeing a &s;tranger enter, Antonia uttered a cry of joy; but her hopes of receiving &s;uccour from him were &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated. The &s;uppo&s;ed novice, without expre&s;&s;ing the lea&s;t &s;urpri&s;e at finding a woman alone with the monk, in &s;o &s;trange a place, and at &s;o late an hour, addre&s;&s;ed him thus without lo&s;ing a moment:</P>
<P>"What is to be done? We are lo&s;t, unle&s;s &s;ome &s;peedy means is found of di&s;pelling the rioters. Am|bro&s;io, the convent of St. Clare is on fire; the prior|e&s;s has fallen a victim to the fury of the mob. Al|ready is the abbey menaced with a &s;imilar fate. A|larmed at the threats of the people, the monks &s;eek for you every where. They imagine that your authority alone will &s;uffice to calm this di&s;turbance. No one knows what is become of you, and your ab&s;ence cre|ates univer&s;al a&s;toni&s;hment and de&s;pair. I profited by the confu&s;ion, and fled hither to warn you of the danger."</P>
<P>"This will &s;oon be remedied," an&s;wered the ab|bot; I will ha&s;ten back to my cell: a trivial rea&s;on will account for my having been mi&s;&s;ed."</P>
<P>"Impo&s;&s;ible!" rejoined Matilda: "The &s;epul|chre is filled with archers. Lorenzo de Medina, with &s;everal officers of the Inqui&s;ition, &s;earches through the vaults, and pervades every pa&s;&s;age. You will be intercepted in your flight; your rea&s;ons for being at this late hour in the &s;epulchre will be examined; An|tonia will be found, and then you are undone forever."</P>
<P>"Lorenzo de Medina? Officers of the Inqui&s;ition?
<PB N="191" REF="035729_0446_10065BA8575C9358">
What brings them here? Seek they for me? Am I then &s;u&s;pected? Oh! &s;peak&punc; Matilda! an&s;wer me in pity!"</P>
<P>"As yet they do not think of you; but I fear that they will ere long. Your only chance of e&s;caping their notice re&s;ts upon the difficulty of exploring this vault. The door is artfully hidden; haply it may not be ob&s;erved, and we may remain concealed till the &s;earch is over."</P>
<P>"But Antonia...... Should the inqui&s;itors draw near, and her cries be heard....."</P>
<P>"Thus I remove that danger!" interrupted Ma|tilda.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time drawing a poniard, &s;he ru&s;hed upon her devoted prey.</P>
<P>"Hold! hold!" cried Ambro&s;io, &s;eizing her hand, and wre&s;ting from it the already lifted weapon. "What would you do, cruel woman? The unfor|tunate has already &s;uffered but too much, thanks to your pernicious coun&s;els! Would to God that I had never followed them! Would to God that I had never &s;een your face!"</P>
<P>Matilda darted upon him a look of &s;corn.</P>
<P>"Ab&s;urd!" &s;he exclaimed with an air of pa&s;&s;ion and maje&s;ty, which impre&s;&s;ed the monk with awe. "After robbing her of all that made it dear, can you fear to deprive her of a life &s;o mi&s;erable? But 'tis well! Let her live to convince you of your folly. I abandon you to your evil di&s;tiny! I di&s;claim your alliance! Who trembles to commit &s;o in&s;ignificant a

crime, de&s;erves not my protection. Hark! hark! Ambro&s;io; hear you not the archers? They come, and your de&s;truction is inevitable!"</P>
<P>At this moment the abbot heard the &s;ound of di&s;|tant voices. He flew to clo&s;e the door, on who&s;e concealment his &s;afety depended, and which Matilda had neglected to fa&s;ten. Ere he could reach it, he &s;aw Antonia glide &s;uddenly by him, ru&s;h through the door, and fly towards the noi&s;e with the &s;wiftne&s;s of an arrow. She had li&s;tened attentively to Matilda; &s;he heard Lorenzo's name mentioned, and re&s;olved to ri&s;k every thing to throw her&s;elf under his protec|tion. The door was open. The &s;ounds convinced her that the archers could be at no great di&s;tance. She mu&s;tered up her little remaining &s;trength, ru&s;hed by the monk ere he perceived her de&s;ign, and bent her cour&s;e rapidly towards the voices. As &s;oon as he recovered from his fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;e, the abbot failed not to pur&s;ue her. In vain did Antonia redouble her &s;peed, and &s;tretch every nerve to the utmo&s;t. Her enemy gained upon her every moment: &s;he heard his &s;teps clo&s;e after her, and felt the heat of his breath glow upon her neck. He overtook her; he twi&s;ted his hand in the ringlets of her &s;treaming hair, and at|tempted to drag her back with him to the dungeon. Antonia re&s;i&s;ted with all her &s;trength. She folded her arms round a pillar which &s;upported the roof, and &s;hrieked loudly for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. In vain did the monk &s;trive to threaten her to &s;ilence.</P>
<P>"Help!" &s;he continued to exclaim: "help! help! for God's &s;ake!"</P>
<P>Quickened by her cries, the &s;ound of foot&s;teps was
<PB N="193" REF="035729_0448_10065BA9F8C04648">
heard approaching. The abbot expected every mo|ment to &s;ee the inqui&s;itors arrive. Antonia &s;till re&s;i&s;t|ed, and he now enforced her &s;ilence by means the mo&s;t horrible and inhuman. He &s;till gra&s;ped Matilda's dagger: without allowing him&s;elf a moment's reflec|tion, he rai&s;ed it, and plunged it twice in the bo&s;om of Antonia. She &s;hrieked, and &s;unk upon the ground. The monk endeavoured to bear her away with him, but &s;he &s;till embraced the pillar firmly. At that in|&s;tant the light of approaching torches fla&s;hed upon the walls. Dreading a di&s;covery, Ambro&s;io was com|pelled to abandon his victim, and ha&s;tily fled back to the vault, where he had left Matilda.</P>
<P>He fled not unob&s;erved. Don Ramirez, happen|ing to arrive the fir&s;t, perceived a female bleeding upon the ground, and a man flying from the &s;pot, who&s;e confu&s;ion betrayed him for the murderer. He in&s;tantly pur&s;ued the fugitive, with &s;ome part of the archers, while the others remained with Lorenzo to protect the wounded &s;tranger. They rai&s;ed her, and &s;upported her in their arms. She had fainted from ex|ce&s;s of pain, but &s;oon gave &s;igns of returning life. She opened her eyes: and on lifting up her head, the quantity of fair hair fell back, which till then had ob|&s;cured her features.</P>
<P>"God Almighty! it is Antonia!"</P>
<P>Such was Lorenzo's exclamation, while he &s;natched her from the attendant's arms, and cla&s;ped her in his own.</P>
<P>Though aimed by an uncertain hand, the poniard had an&s;wered but too well the purpo&s;e of its employer. The wounds were mortal, and Antonia was con&s;cious
<PB N="194" REF="035729_0449_10065B7362C9BB30">
that &s;he never could recover. Yet the few moments which remained for her, were moments of happine&s;s. The concern expre&s;&s;ed upon Lorenzo's countenance, the frantic fondne&s;s of his complaints, and his earne&s;t inquiries re&s;pecting her wounds, convinced her be|yond a doubt that his affections were her own. She would not be removed from the vaults, fearing le&s;t motion &s;hould only ha&s;ten her death: and &s;he was un|willing to lo&s;e tho&s;e moments which &s;he pa&s;&s;ed in re|ceiving proofs of Lorenzo's love, and a&s;&s;uring him of her own. She told him, that had &s;he &s;till been undefiled &s;he might have lamented the lo&s;s of life; but that, deprived of honor and branded with &s;hame, death was to her a ble&s;&s;ing: &s;he could not have been his wife; and that hope being denied her, &s;he re&s;ign|ed her&s;elf to the grave without one &s;igh of regret. She bade him take courage, conjured him not to abandon him&s;elf to fruitle&s;s &s;orrow, and declared that &s;he mourned to leave nothing in the whole world but him. While every &s;weet accent increa&s;ed rather than light|ened Lorenzo's grief, &s;he continued to conver&s;e with him till the moment of di&s;&s;olution. Her voice grew faint, and &s;carcely audible; a thick cloud &s;pread it&s;elf over her eyes; her heart beat &s;low and irregular, and every in&s;tant &s;eemed to announce that her fate was near at hand.</P>
<P>She lay, her head reclining upon Lorenzo's bo&s;om, and her lips &s;till murmuring to him words of comfort. She was interrupted by the convent bell, as, tolling at a di&s;tance, it &s;truck the hour. Suddenly Antonia's eyes &s;parkled with cele&s;tial brightne&s;s: her frame &s;eemed to have received new &s;trength and animation. She &s;tarted from her lover's arms.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="035729_0450_10065BAB8D7A5CF8">
"Three o'clock," &s;he cried. "Mother, I come!"</P>
<P>She cla&s;ped her hands and &s;unk lifele&s;s upon the ground. Lorenzo, in agony, threw him&s;elf be&s;ide her. He tore his hair, beat his brea&s;t, and refu&s;ed to be &s;eparated from the cor&s;e. At length his force be|ing exhau&s;ted, he &s;uffered him&s;elf to be led from the vault, and was conveyed to the palace de Medina &s;carcely more alive than the unfortunate Antonia.</P>
<P>In the mean while, though clo&s;ely pur&s;ued, Ambro|&s;io &s;ucceeded in regaining the vault. The door was already fa&s;tened when Don Ramirez arrived, and much time elap&s;ed ere the fugitive's retreat was di&s;|covered. But nothing can re&s;i&s;t per&s;everance. Though &s;o artfully concealed, the door could not e&s;cape the vigilance of the archers. They forced it open, and entered the vault to the infinite di&s;may of Ambro&s;io and his companion. The monk's confu&s;ion, his at|tempt to hide him&s;elf, his rapid flight, and the blood &s;prinkled upon his clothes, left no room to doubt his being Antonia's murderer. But when he was recog|ni&s;ed for the immaculate Ambro&s;io, "the man of ho|line&s;s," the idol of Madrid; the faculties of the &s;pec|tators were chained up in &s;urpri&s;e, and &s;carcely could they per&s;uade them&s;elves that what they &s;aw was no vi&s;ion. The abbot &s;trove not to vindicate him&s;elf, but pre&s;erved a &s;ullen &s;ilence. He was &s;ecured and bound. The &s;ame precaution was taken with Matilda. Her cowl being removed, the delicacy of her features and profu&s;ion of her golden hair betrayed her &s;ex; and this incident created fre&s;h amazement. The dagger was al&s;o found in the tomb, where the monk had thrown it; and the dungeon having un|dergone

a thorough &s;earch, the two culprits were con|veyed to the pri&s;ons of the Inqui&s;ition.</P>
<P>Don Ramirez took care that the populace &s;hould re|main ignorant both of the crimes and profe&s;&s;ion of the captives. He feared a repetition of the riots, which had followed the apprehending the priore&s;s of St. Clare. He contented him&s;elf with &s;tating to the Cap|uchins the guilt of their &s;uperior. To avoid the &s;hame of a public accu&s;ation, and dreading the popu|lar fury, from which they had already &s;aved their ab|bey with much difficulty, the monks readily permitted the inqui&s;itors to &s;earch their man&s;ion without noi&s;e. No fre&s;h di&s;coveries were made. The effects found in the abbot's and Matilda's cells were &s;eized, and car|ried to the Inqui&s;ition to be produced in evidence. Every thing el&s;e remained in its former po&s;ition, and order and tranquillity once more prevailed through Madrid.</P>
<P>St. Clare's convent was completely ruined by the united ravages of the mob and conflagration. Noth|ing remained of it but the principal walls, who&s;e thickne&s;s and &s;olidity had pre&s;erved them from the flames. The nuns who had belonged to it were obliged, in con&s;equence, to di&s;per&s;e them&s;elves into other &s;ocieties: but the prejudice again&s;t them ran high, and the &s;uperiors were very unwilling to admit them. However, mo&s;t of them being related to fami|lies the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed for their riches, birth, and power, the &s;everal convents were compelled to re|ceive them, though they did it with a very ill grace. This prejudice was extremely fal&s;e and unju&s;tifiable. After a clo&s;e inve&s;tigation, it was proved that all in
<PB N="197" REF="035729_0452_10065BAFDD9B3D28">
the convent were per&s;uaded that Agnes had died in childbed, except the four nuns whom St. Ur&s;ula had pointed out. The&s;e had fallen victims to the popular fury, as had al&s;o &s;everal who were perfectly innocent and uncon&s;cious of the whole affair. Blinded by re|&s;entment, the mob had &s;acrificed every nun who fell into their hands: they who e&s;caped were entirely in|debted to the duke de Medina's prudence and modera|tion. Of this they were con&s;cious, and felt for that nobleman a proper &s;en&s;e of gratitude.</P>
<P>Virginia was not the mo&s;t &s;paring of her thanks; &s;he wi&s;hed equally to make a proper return for his at|tentions, and to obtain the good graces of Lorenzo's uncle. In this &s;he ea&s;ily &s;ucceeded. The duke be|held her beauty with wonder and admiration; and while his eyes were enchanted with her form, the &s;weetne&s;s of her manners, and her tender concern for the &s;uffering nun, prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his heart in her favour. This Virginia had di&s;cernment enough to perceive, and &s;he redoubled her attention to the invalid. When he parted from her at the door of her father's palace, the duke entreated permi&s;&s;ion to inquire occa&s;ionally after her health. His reque&s;t was readily granted; Virginia a&s;&s;ured him, that the marquis de Villa Franca would be proud of an opportunity to thank him in per&s;on for the protection afforded to her. They now &s;eparated; he enchanted with her beauty and gentle|ne&s;s, and &s;he much plea&s;ed with him, and more with his nephew.</P>
<P>On entering the palace, Virginia's fir&s;t care was to &s;ummon the family phy&s;ician, and take care of her unknown charge. Her mother ha&s;tened to &s;hare with
<PB N="198" REF="035729_0453_10065B7941024D00">
her the charitable office. Alarmed by the riots, and trembling for his daughter's &s;afety, who was his only child, the marquis had flown to St. Clare's convent, and was &s;till employed in &s;eeking her. Me&s;&s;engers were now di&s;patched on all &s;ides to inform him, that he would find her &s;afe at his hotel, and de&s;ire him to ha&s;ten thither immediately. His ab&s;ence gave Vir|ginia liberty to be&s;tow her whole attention upon her patient; and though much di&s;ordered her&s;elf by the adventures of the night, no per&s;ua&s;ion could induce her to quit the bed &s;ide of the &s;ufferer. Her con&s;titu|tion being much enfeebled by want and &s;orrow, it was &s;ome time before the &s;tranger was re&s;tored to her &s;en&s;es. She found great difficulty in &s;wallowing the medicines pre&s;cribed to her; but this ob&s;tacle being removed, &s;he ea&s;ily conquered her di&s;ea&s;e, which pro|ceeded from nothing but weakne&s;s. The attention which was paid her, the whole&s;ome food to which &s;he had been long a &s;tranger, and her joy at being re&s;tored to liberty, to &s;ociety, and, as &s;he dared to hope, to love, all this combined to her &s;peedy ree&s;tabli&s;hment. From the fir&s;t moment of knowing her, her melan|choly &s;ituation, her &s;ufferings almo&s;t unparalleled, had gained the affections of her amiable ho&s;te&s;s. Virginia felt for her the mo&s;t lively intere&s;t; but how was &s;he delighted, when, her gue&s;t being &s;ufficiently recovered to relate her hi&s;tory, &s;he recogni&s;ed in the captive nun the &s;i&s;ter of Lorenzo!</P>
<P>This victim of mona&s;tic cruelty was indeed no other than the unfortunate Agnes. During her abode in the convent, &s;he had been well known to Virgin|ia; but her emaciated form, her features altered by affliction, her death univer&s;ally credited, and her over|grown
<PB N="199" REF="035729_0454_10065BB1635F2918">
and matted hair which hung over her face and bo&s;om in di&s;order, at fir&s;t had prevented her being re|collected. The priore&s;s had put every artifice in practice to induce Virginia to take the veil; for the heire&s;s of Villa Franca would have been no de&s;pica|ble acqui&s;ition. Her &s;eeming kindne&s;s and unremit|ted attention &s;o far &s;ucceeded, that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> relation began to think &s;eriou&s;ly upon compliance. Better in&s;tructed in the di&s;gu&s;t and ennui of a mona&s;tic life, Agnes had penetrated the de&s;igns of the domina. She trembled for the innocent girl, and endeavoured to make her &s;en&s;ible of her error. She painted in their true colours the numerous inconveniences attached to a convent, the continued re&s;traint, the low jealou&s;ies, the petty intrigues, the &s;ervile court and gro&s;s flattery expected by the &s;uperior. She then bade Virginia reflect on the brilliant pro&s;pect which pre&s;ented it|&s;elf before her. The idol of her parents, the admi|ration of Madrid, endowed by nature and education with every perfection of per&s;on and mind, &s;he might look forward to an e&s;tabli&s;hment the mo&s;t fortunate. Her riches furni&s;hed her with the means of exerci&s;ing, in their fulle&s;t extent, charity and benevolence, tho&s;e virtues &s;o dear to her; and her &s;tay in the world would enable her di&s;covering objects worthy her pro|tection, which could not be done in the &s;eclu&s;ion of a convent.</P>
<P>Her per&s;ua&s;ions induced Virginia to lay a&s;ide all thoughts of the vei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, but another argument, not u&s;ed by Agnes, had more weight with her than all the others put together. She had &s;een Lorenzo when he vi&s;ited his &s;i&s;ter at the grate; his per&s;on plea&s;ed her, and her conver&s;ations with Agnes generally u&s;ed to
<PB N="200" REF="035729_0455_10065B7AC9B7E658">
terminate in &s;ome que&s;tion about her brother. She, who doted upon Lorenzo, wi&s;hed for no better than an opportunity to trumpet out his prai&s;e. She &s;poke of him in terms of rapture; and, to convince her au|ditor how ju&s;t were his &s;entiments, how cultivated his mind, and elegant his expre&s;&s;ions, &s;he &s;hewed her at different times the letters which &s;he received from him. She &s;oon perceived that from the&s;e communi|cations the heart of her young friend had imbibed impre&s;&s;ions which &s;he was far from intending to give, but was truly happy to di&s;cover. She could not have wi&s;hed her brother a more de&s;irable union: heire&s;s of Villa Franca, virtuous, affectionate, beautiful, and accompli&s;hed, Virginia &s;eemed calculated to make him happy. She &s;ounded her brother upon the &s;ub|ject, though without mentioning names or circum|&s;tances. He a&s;&s;ured her in his an&s;wers, that his heart and hand were totally di&s;engaged, and &s;he thought that upon the&s;e grounds &s;he might proceed without danger. She in con&s;equence endeavoured to &s;trength|en the dawning pa&s;&s;ion of her friend. Lorenzo was made the con&s;tant topic of her di&s;cour&s;e; and the avidity with which her auditor li&s;tened, the &s;ighs which frequently e&s;caped from her bo&s;om, and the eagerne&s;s with which upon any digre&s;&s;ion &s;he brought back the conver&s;ation to the &s;ubject whence it had wandered, &s;ufficed to convince Agnes that her bro|ther's addre&s;&s;es would be far from di&s;agreeable. She at length ventured to mention her wi&s;hes to the duke. Though a &s;tranger to the lady her&s;elf, he knew enough of her &s;ituation to think her worthy his nephew's hand. It was agreed between him and his niece, that &s;he &s;hould in&s;inuate the idea to Lorenzo, and &s;he only waited his return to Madrid to propo&s;e her
<PB N="201" REF="035729_0456_10065BB30076C258">
friend to him as his bride. The unfortunate events which took place in the interim prevented her from executing her de&s;ign. Virginia wept her lo&s;s &s;in|cerely, both as a companion, and as the only per&s;on to whom &s;he could &s;peak of Lorenzo. Her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> continued to prey upon her heart in &s;ecret, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;he had almo&s;t determined to confe&s;s her &s;entiments to her mother, when accident once more threw their ob|ject in her way. The &s;ight of him &s;o near her, his politene&s;s, his compa&s;&s;ion, his intrepidity, had com|bined to give new ardour to her affection. When &s;he now found her friend and advocate re&s;tored to her, &s;he looked upon her as a gift from Heaven; &s;he ven|tured to cheri&s;h the hope of being united to Lorenzo, and re&s;olved to u&s;e with him his &s;i&s;ter's influence.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing that before her death Agnes might po&s;|&s;ibly have made the propo&s;al, the duke had placed all his nephew's hints of marriage to Virginia's account; con&s;equently he gave them the mo&s;t fa|vourable reception. On returning to his hotel, the relation given him of Antonia's death, and Lorenzo's behaviour on the occa&s;ion, made evident his mi&s;take. He lamented the circum&s;tances; but the unhappy girl being effectually out of the way, he tru&s;ted that his de&s;igns would yet be executed. 'Tis true that Lorenzo'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> s;ituation ju&s;t then ill &s;uited him for a bride|groom. His hopes di&s;appointed at the moment when he expected to realize them, and the dreadful and &s;udden death of his mi&s;tre&s;s had affected him very &s;everely. The duke found him upon the bed of &s;ickne&s;s. His attendants expre&s;&s;ed &s;erious apprehen|&s;ions for his life; but the uncle entertained not the &s;ame fears. He was of opinion, and not unwi&s;ely,
<PB N="202" REF="035729_0457_10065B7C5088E518">
that "men have died, and worms have ate them, but not for love!" He therefore flattered him&s;elf, that, however deep might be the impre&s;&s;ion made upon his nephew's heart, time and Virginia would be able to efface it. He now ha&s;tened to the afflicted youth, and endeavoured to con&s;ole him: he &s;ympa|thi&s;ed in his di&s;tre&s;s, but encouraged him to re&s;i&s;t the encroachments of de&s;pair. He allowed, that he could not but feel &s;hocked at an event &s;o terrible, nor could he blame his &s;en&s;ibility; but he be&s;ought him not to torment him&s;elf with vain regrets, and rather to &s;truggle with affliction, and pre&s;erve his life, if not for his own &s;ake, at lea&s;t for the &s;ake of tho&s;e who were fondly attached to him. While he laboured thus to make Lorenzo forget Antonia's lo&s;s, the duke paid his court a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly to Virginia, and &s;eized every op|portunity to advance his nephew's intere&s;t in her heart.</P>
<P>It may ea&s;ily be expected that Agnes was not long without inquiring after Don Raymond. She was &s;hocked to hear the wretched &s;ituation to which grief had reduced him; yet &s;he could not help exulting &s;e|cretly when &s;he reflected that his illne&s;s proved the &s;incerity of his love. The duke undertook the office him&s;elf, of announcing to the invalid the happine&s;s which awaited him. Though he omitted no precau|tion to prepare him for &s;uch an event, at this &s;udden change from de&s;pair to happine&s;s, Raymond's tran&s;|ports were &s;o violent, as nearly to have proved fatal to him. The&s;e once pa&s;&s;ed, the tranquillity of his mind, the a&s;&s;urance of felicity, and above all, the pre&s;ence of Agnes (who was no &s;ooner ree&s;tabli&s;hed by the care of Virginia and the marchione&s;s, than &s;he ha&s;tened to attend her lover,) &s;oon enabled him to overcome the
<PB N="203" REF="035729_0458_10065BBAD0C3A810">
effects of his late dreadful malady. The calm of his &s;oul communicated it&s;elf to his body, and he recovered with &s;uch rapidity as to create univer&s;al &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>Not &s;o Lorenzo. Antonia's death, accompanied with &s;uch terrible circum&s;tances, weighed upon his mind heavily. He was worn down to a &s;hadow; nothing could give him plea&s;ure. He was per&s;uaded with difficulty to &s;wallow nouri&s;hment &s;ufficient for the &s;upport of life, and a con&s;umption was apprehend|ed. The &s;ociety of Agnes formed his only comfort. Though accident had never permitted their being much together, he entertained for her a &s;incere friend&s;hip and attachment. Perceiving how nece&s;&s;ary &s;he was to him, &s;he &s;eldom quitted his chamber. She li&s;tened to his complaints with unwearied attention, and &s;ooth|ed him by the gentlene&s;s of her manners, and by &s;ympathi&s;ing with his di&s;tre&s;s. She &s;till inhabited the palace de Villa Franca, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of which treated her with marked affection. The duke had intimated to the marquis his wi&s;hes re&s;pecting Virginia. The match was unexceptionable; Lorenzo was heir to his uncle's immen&s;e property, and was di&s;tingui&s;hed in Madrid for his agreeable per&s;on, exten&s;ive knowledge, and propriety of conduct. Add to this, that the mar|chione&s;s had di&s;covered how &s;trong was her daughter's prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in his favour.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence, the duke's propo&s;al was accepted without he&s;itation: every precaution was taken to in|duce Lorenzo's &s;eeing the lady with tho&s;e &s;entiments which &s;he &s;o well merited to excite. In her vi&s;its to her brother, Agnes was frequently accompanied by the marchione&s;s; and as &s;oon as he was able to move into his antichamber, Virginia, under her mother's
<PB N="204" REF="035729_0459_10065B80E86CC910">
protection, was &s;ometimes permitted to expre&s;s her wi&s;hes for his recovery. This &s;he did with &s;uch deli|cacy, the manner in which &s;he mentioned Antonia was &s;o tender and &s;oothing, and, when &s;he lamented her rival's melancholy fate, her bright eyes &s;hone &s;o beau|tiful through her tears, that Lorenzo could not behold or li&s;ten to her without emotion. His relations, as well as the lady, perceived that with every day her &s;ociety &s;eemed to give him fre&s;h plea&s;ure, and that he &s;poke of her in terms of &s;tronger admiration. However, they prudently kept their ob&s;ervations to them&s;elves. No word was dropped which might lead him to &s;u&s;|pect their de&s;igns. They continued their former con|duct and attention, and left time to ripen into a warm|er &s;entiment the friend&s;hip which he already felt for Virginia.</P>
<P>In the mean while, her vi&s;its became more fre|quent; and latterly there was &s;carce a day, of which &s;he did not pa&s;s &s;ome part by the &s;ide of Lorenzo's couch. He gradually regained his &s;trength, but the progre&s;s of his recovery was &s;low and doubtful. One evening he &s;eemed to be in better &s;pirits than u&s;ual. Agnes and her lover, the duke, Virginia, and her parents were &s;itting round him. He now for the fir&s;t time entreated his &s;i&s;ter to inform him how &s;he had e&s;caped the effects of the poi&s;on which St. Ur&s;ula had &s;een her &s;wallow. Fearful of recalling tho&s;e &s;cenes to his mind in which Antonia had peri&s;hed, &s;he had hitherto concealed from him the hi&s;tory of her &s;uffer|ings. As he now &s;tarted the &s;ubject him&s;elf, and thinking that perhaps the narrative of her &s;orrows might draw him from the contemplation of tho&s;e on which he dwelt too con&s;tantly, &s;he immediately com|plied
<PB N="205" REF="035729_0460_10065BB48903ADA0">
with his reque&s;t. The re&s;t of the company had already heard her &s;tory: but the intere&s;t which all pre&s;ent felt for its heroine, made them anxious to hear it repeated. The whole &s;ociety &s;econding Lo|renzo's entreaties, Agnes obeyed. She fir&s;t recounted the di&s;covery which had taken place in the abbey chapel, the domina's re&s;entment, and the midnight &s;cene of which St. Ur&s;ula had been a concealed wit|ne&s;s. Though the nun had already de&s;cribed this lat|ter event, Agnes now related it more circum&s;tantially, and at large. After which &s;he proceeded in her nar|rative as follows:</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION OF THE HISTORY OF AGNES DE MEDINA.</HEAD>
<P>MY &s;uppo&s;ed death was attended with the greate&s;t agonies. Tho&s;e moments which I believed my la&s;t were embittered by the domina's a&s;&s;urances that I could not e&s;cape perdition; and as my eyes clo&s;ed, I heard her rage exhale it&s;elf in cur&s;es on my offence. The horror of this &s;ituation, of a death bed from which hope was bani&s;hed, of a &s;leep from which I was only to wake to find my&s;elf the prey of flames and fu|ries, was more dreadful than I can de&s;cribe. When animation revived in me, my &s;oul was &s;till impre&s;&s;ed with the&s;e terrible ideas. I looked round with fear, expecting to behold the mini&s;ters of divine vengeance. For the fir&s;t hour, my &s;en&s;es were &s;o bewildered, and my brain &s;o dizzy, that I &s;trove in vain to arrange the &s;trange images which floated in wild confu&s;ion before me. If I endeavoured to rai&s;e my&s;elf from the ground, the wandering of my head deceived me. Every thing around me &s;eemed to rock, and I &s;unk once more upon the earth. My weak and dazzled eyes were un|able
<PB N="206" REF="035729_0461_10065B826F682B60">
to bear a nearer approach to a gleam of light, which I &s;aw trembling above me. I was compelled to clo&s;e them again, and remain motionle&s;s in the &s;ame po&s;ture.</P>
<P>A full hour elap&s;ed, before I was &s;ufficiently my|&s;elf to examine the &s;urrounding objects. When I did examine them, what terror filled my bo&s;om! I found my&s;elf extended upon a &s;ort of wicker couch. It had &s;ix handles to it, which doubtle&s;s had &s;erved the nuns to convey me to my grave. I was covered with a linen cloth: &s;everal faded flowers were &s;trown over me. On one &s;ide lay a &s;mall wooden crucifix; on the other a ro&s;ary of large beads. Four low narrow walls confined me. The top was al&s;o covered, and in it was fitted a &s;mall grated door, through which was admitted the little air that circulated in this mi&s;erable place. A faint glimmering of light, which &s;treamed through the bars, permitted me to di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;ur|rounding horrors. I was oppre&s;&s;ed by a noi&s;ome &s;uffocating &s;mell; and perceiving that the grated door was unfa&s;tened, I thought that I might po&s;&s;ibly effect my e&s;cape. As I rai&s;ed my&s;elf with this de&s;ign, my hand re&s;ted upon &s;omething &s;oft: I gra&s;ped it, and advanced it towards the light. Almighty God! what was my di&s;gu&s;t! my con&s;ternation! In &s;pite of its putridity, and the worms which preyed upon it, I per|ceived a corrupted human head, and recogni&s;ed the features of a nun who had died &s;ome months before. I threw it from me, and &s;unk almo&s;t lifele&s;s upon my bier.</P>
<P>When my &s;trength returned, this circum&s;tance, and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of being &s;urrounded by the
<PB N="207" REF="035729_0462_10065BB948C02C60">
loath&s;ome and mouldering bodies of my companions, increa&s;ed my de&s;ire to e&s;cape from my fearful pri&s;on. I again moved towards the light. The grated door was within my reach. I lifted it without difficulty: probably it had been left unclo&s;ed, to facilitate my quitting the dungeon. Aiding my&s;elf by the irregu|larity of the walls, &s;ome of who&s;e &s;tones projected be|yond the re&s;t, I contrived to a&s;cend them, and drag my&s;elf out of my pri&s;on. I now found my&s;elf in a vault tolerably &s;pacious. Several tombs, &s;imilar in appearance to that whence I had ju&s;t e&s;caped, were ranged along the &s;ides in order, and &s;eemed to be con&s;iderably &s;unk within the earth. A &s;epul|chral lamp was &s;u&s;pended from the roof by an iron chain, and &s;hed a gloomy light through the dungeon. Emblems of death were &s;een on every &s;ide: &s;kulls, &s;houlder blades, thigh bones, and other reliques of mortality, were &s;cattered upon the dewy ground. Each tomb was ornamented with a large crucifix, and in one corner &s;tood a wooden &s;tatue of St. Clare. To the&s;e objects I at fir&s;t paid no attention: a door, the only outlet from the vault, had attracted my eyes. I ha&s;tened towards it, having wrapped my winding &s;heet clo&s;ely round me. I pu&s;hed again&s;t the door, and to my inexpre&s;&s;ible terror found that it was fa&s;|tened on the out&s;ide.</P>
<P>I gue&s;&s;ed immediately, that the priore&s;s, mi&s;taking the nature of the liquor which &s;he had compelled me to drink, in&s;tead of poi&s;on had admini&s;tered a &s;trong opiate. From this I concluded that, being to all ap|pearance dead, I had received the rites of burial; and that, deprived of the power of making my exi&s;tence known, it would be my fate to expire of hunger.
<PB N="208" REF="035729_0463_10065B840106FC38">
This idea penetrated me with horror, not merely for my own &s;ake, but that of the innocent creature who &s;till lived within my bo&s;om. I again endeavoured to open the door, but it re&s;i&s;ted all my efforts. I &s;tretch|ed my voice to the extent of its compa&s;s, and &s;hrieked for aid. I was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> the hearing of every one. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> friendly voice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> mine. A profound and melancholy &s;ilence prevailed through the vault, and I de&s;paired of liberty. My long ab&s;tinence from food now began to torment me. The tortures which hunger inflicted on me, were the mo&s;t painful and in|&s;upportable: yet they &s;eemed to increa&s;e with every hour which pa&s;&s;ed over my head. Sometimes I threw my&s;elf upon the ground, and rolled upon it wild and de&s;perate: &s;ometimes &s;tarting up, I returned to the door, again &s;trove to force it open, and repeated my fruitle&s;s cries for &s;uccour. Often was I on the point of &s;triking my temple again&s;t the &s;harp corner of &s;ome monument, da&s;hing out my brains, and thus terminat|ing my woes at once. But &s;till the remembrance of my baby vanqui&s;hed my re&s;olution. I trembled at a deed, which equally endangered my child's exi&s;tence and my own. Then would I vent my angui&s;h in loud exclamations and pa&s;&s;ionate complaints; and then again my &s;trength failing me, &s;ilent and hopele&s;s I would &s;it me down upon the ba&s;e of St. Clare's &s;tatue, &s;old my arms, and abandon my&s;elf to &s;ullen de&s;|pair. Thus pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal wretched hours. Death advanced towards me with rapid &s;trides, and I ex|pected that every &s;ucceeding moment would be that of my di&s;&s;olution. Suddenly a neighbouring tomb caught my eye: a ba&s;ket &s;tood upon it, which till then I had not ob&s;erved. I &s;tarted from my &s;eat; I made to|wards
<PB N="209" REF="035729_0464_10065BBC575BD008">
it as &s;wiftly as my exhau&s;ted frame would per|mit. How eagerly did I &s;eize the ba&s;ket, on finding it to contain a loaf of coar&s;e bread and a &s;mall bottle of water!</P>
<P>I threw my&s;elf with avidity upon the&s;e humble ali|ments. They had to all appearance been placed in the vault for &s;everal days. The bread was hard, and the water tainted: yet never did I ta&s;te food to me &s;o delicious. When the cravings of appetite were &s;ati&s;|fied, I bu&s;ied my&s;elf with conjectures upon this new circum&s;tance. I debated whether the ba&s;ket had been placed there with a view to my nece&s;&s;ity. Hope an|&s;wered my doubts in the affirmative. Yet who could gue&s;s me to be in need of &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance? If my ex|i&s;tence was known, why was I detained in this gloomy vault? If I was kept a pri&s;oner, what meant the ceremony of committing me to the tomb? Or, if I was doomed to peri&s;h with hunger, to who&s;e pity was I indebted for provi&s;ions placed within my reach? A friend would not have kept my dreadful puni&s;h|ment a &s;ecret: neither did it &s;eem probable that an enemy would have taken pains to &s;upply me with the means of exi&s;tence. Upon the whole I was inclined to think, that the Domina's de&s;igns upon my life had been di&s;covered by &s;ome one of my parti|&s;ans in the convent, who had found means to &s;ub&s;ti|tute an opiate for poi&s;on; that &s;he had furni&s;hed me with food to &s;upport me, till &s;he could effect my de|livery; and that &s;he was then employed in giving intelli|gence to my relations of my danger, and pointing out a way to relea&s;e me from captivity. Yet why then was the quality of my provi&s;ions &s;o coar&s;e? how could my friend have entered the vault without the domina's

knowledge? and if &s;he had entered, why was the door fa&s;tened &s;o carefully? The&s;e reflections &s;taggered me: yet &s;till this idea was the mo&s;t favourable to my hopes, and I dwelt upon it in preference.</P>
<P>My meditations were interrupted by the &s;ound of di&s;tant foot&s;teps. They approached, but &s;lowly. Rays of light now darted through the crevices of the door. Uncertain whether the per&s;ons who advanced came to relieve me, or were conducted by &s;ome other motive to the vault, I failed not to attract their notice by loud cries for help. Still the &s;ounds drew near. The light grew &s;tronger. At length with inexpre&s;&s;i|ble plea&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> I heard the key turning in the lock. Per|&s;uaded that my deliverance was at hand, I flew to|wards the door with a &s;hriek of joy. It opened: but all my hopes of e&s;cape died away, when the prior|e&s;s appeared, followed by the &s;ame four nuns who had been witne&s;&s;es of my &s;uppo&s;ed death. They bore torches in their hands, and gazed upon me in fearful &s;ilence.</P>
<P>I &s;tarted back in terror. The domina de&s;cended into the vault, as did al&s;o her companions. She bent upon me a &s;tern re&s;entful eye, but expre&s;&s;ed no &s;ur|pri&s;e at finding me &s;till living. She took the &s;eat which I had ju&s;t quitted. The door was again clo&s;ed, and the nuns ranged them&s;elves behind their &s;uperior, while the glare of their torches, dimmed by the va|pours and dampne&s;s of the vault, gilded with cold beams the &s;urrounding monuments. For &s;ome moments all pre&s;erved a dead and &s;olemn &s;ilence. I &s;tood at &s;ome di&s;tance from the priore&s;s. At length &s;he beckoned to me to advance. Trembling at the &s;everity of her a&s;|pect,
<PB N="211" REF="035729_0466_10065BBDE70A6E38">
my &s;trength &s;carce &s;ufficed me to obey her. I drew near, but my limbs were unable to &s;upport their burden. I &s;unk upon my knees, I cla&s;ped my hands and lifted them up to her for mercy but had no power to articulate a &s;yllable.</P>
<P>She gazed upon me with angry eyes.</P>
<P>"Do I &s;ee a penitent or a criminal?" &s;he &s;aid at length: "Are tho&s;e hands rai&s;ed in contrition for your crimes, or in fear of meeting their puni&s;hment? Do tho&s;e tears acknowledge the ju&s;tice of your doom, or only &s;olicit mitigation of your &s;ufferings? I fear me, 'tis the latter!"</P>
<P>She pau&s;ed, but kept her eyes &s;till fixed upon mine.</P>
<P>"Take courage," &s;he continued; "I wi&s;h not for your death, but your repentance. The draught which I admini&s;tered was no poi&s;on, but an opiate. My intention in deceiving you, was to make you feel the agonies of a guilty con&s;cience, had death overtaken you &s;uddenly, while your crimes were &s;till unrepented. You have &s;uffered tho&s;e agonies; I have brought you to be familiar with the &s;harpne&s;s of death, and I tru&s;t that your momentary angui&s;h will prove to you an eternal benefit. It is not my de&s;ign to de&s;troy your immortal &s;oul, or bid you &s;eek the grave, burthened with the weight of &s;ins unexpiated. No, daughter, far from it; I will purify you with whole&s;ome cha&s;|ti&s;ement, and furni&s;h you with full lei&s;ure for con|trition and remor&s;e.&mdash;Hear then my &s;entence: The ill judged zeal of your friends delayed its execution, but cannot now prevent it.

<P>This exordium led me to expect &s;omething terrible, I trembled, and would have &s;poken to deprecate her wrath: but a motion of the domina commanded me to be &s;ilent. She proceeded:</P>
<P>"Though of late years unju&s;tly neglected, and now oppo&s;ed by many of our mi&s;guided &s;i&s;ters (whom Heaven convert!) it is my intention to revive the laws of our order in their full force.

Submit to it, daughter, without re&s;i&s;tance; you will find the benefit of patience and re&s;ignation in a better life than this. Li&s;ten then to the &s;entence of St. Clare. Beneath the&s;e vaults there exi&s;t pri&s;ons, intended to receive &s;uch criminals as your&s;elf: artfully is their entrance concealed, and &s;he who enters them mu&s;t re&s;ign all hopes of liberty.

Weep, daughter, weep, and moi&s;ten your bread with your tears: God knows, that you have ample cau&s;e for &s;orrow!

<P>Thunder &s;truck at this barbarous decree, my little remaining &s;trength abandoned me. I an&s;wered only by falling at her feet, and bathing them with tears. The domina, unmoved by my affliction, ro&s;e from her &s;eat with a &s;tately air; &s;he repeated her commands in an ab&s;olute tone; but exce&s;&s;ive faintne&s;s made me un|able to obey her. Mariana and Alix rai&s;ed me from the ground, and carried me forwards in their arms. The priore&s;s moved on, leaning on Violante, and Ca|milla preceded her with a torch. Thus pa&s;&s;ed our &s;ad proce&s;&s;ion along the pa&s;&s;ages, in &s;ilence only broken by my &s;ighs and groans. We &s;topped before the prin|cipal &s;hrine of St. Clare. The &s;tatue was removed from its pede&s;tal, though how I knew not. The nuns afterwards rai&s;ed an iron grate, till then concealed by the image, and let it fall on the other &s;ide with a loud cra&s;h. The awful &s;ound, repeated by the vaults above and caverns below me, rou&s;ed me from the de&s;pondent apathy in which I had been plunged. I looked before me; an aby&s;s pre&s;ented it&s;elf to my affrighted eyes, and a &s;teep and narrow &s;tairca&s;e, whither my conduc|tors were leading me. I &s;hrieked, and &s;tarted back. I implored compa&s;&s;ion, rent the air with my cries, and &s;ummoned both heaven and earth to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance. In vain! I was hurried down the &s;tairca&s;e, and forced into one of the cells which lined the cavern's &s;ides.</P>
<P>My blood ran cold, as I gazed upon this melan|choly abode. The cold vapours hovering in the air, the walls green with damp, the bed of &s;traw &s;o for|lorn and comfortle&s;s, the chain de&s;tined to bind me
<PB N="214" REF="035729_0469_10065B8B58210C38">
for ever to my pri&s;on, and the reptiles of every de|&s;cription, which, as the torches advanced towards them, I de&s;cried hurrying to their retreats, &s;truck my heart with terrors almo&s;t too exqui&s;ite for nature to bear. Driven by de&s;pair to madne&s;s, I bur&s;t &s;uddenly from the nuns who held me; I threw my&s;elf upon my knees before the priore&s;s, and be&s;ought her mercy in the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate and frantic terms.</P>
<P>"If not on me," &s;aid I, "look at lea&s;t with pity on that innocent being, who&s;e life is attached to mine! Great is my crime, but let not my child &s;uffer for it! My baby has committed no fault. Oh! &s;pare me for the &s;ake of my unborn offspring, whom ere it ta&s;tes life, your &s;everity dooms to de&s;truction!"</P>
<P>The priore&s;s drew back ha&s;tily; &s;he forced her habit from my gra&s;p, as if my touch had been conta|gious.</P>
<P>"What!" &s;he exclaimed with an exa&s;perated air: "What! Dare you plead for the produce of your &s;hame? Shall a creature be permitted to live, con|ceived in guilt &s;o mon&s;trous? Abandoned woman, &s;peak for him no more! Better that the wretch &s;hould peri&s;h than live: begotten in perjury, incontinence, and pollution, it cannot fail to prove a prodigy of vice. Hear me, thou guilty! Expect no mercy from me, either for your&s;elf or brat. Rather pray that death may &s;eize you before you produce it; or, if it mu&s;t &s;ee the light, that its eyes may immediately be clo&s;ed again for ever! No aid &s;hall be given you in your la|bour; bring your offspring into the world your&s;elf, feed it your&s;elf, nur&s;e it your&s;elf, bury it your&s;elf: God grant that the latter may happen &s;oon, le&s;t you receive comfort from the fruit of your iniquity!"</P>

This inhuman &s;peech, the threats which it contain|ed, the dreadful &s;ufferings foretold to me by the dom|ina, and her prayers for my infant's death, on whom, though unborn, I already doted, were more than my exhau&s;ted frame could &s;upport. Uttering a deep groan, I fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s at the feet of my unrelenting enemy. I know not how long I remained in this &s;it|uation; but I imagine that &s;ome time mu&s;t have elap&s;|ed before my recovery, &s;ince it &s;ufficed the priore&s;s and her nuns to quit the cavern. When my &s;en&s;es re|turned, I found my&s;elf in &s;ilence and &s;olitude. I heard not even the retiring foot&s;teps of my per&s;ecu|tors. All was hu&s;hed, and all was dreadful! I had been thrown upon the bed of &s;traw: the heavy chain which I had already eyed with terror, was wound around my wai&s;t, and fa&s;tened me to the wall. A lamp glimmering with dull melancholy rays through my dungeon, permitted my di&s;tingui&s;hing all its hor|rors. It was &s;eparated from the cavern by a low and irregular wall of &s;tone. A large cha&s;m was left open in it, which formed the entrance, for door there was none. A leaden crucifix was in front of my &s;traw couch. A tattered rug lay near me, as did al&s;o a chaplet of beads; and not far from me &s;tood a pitcher of water, and a wicker ba&s;ket containing a &s;mall loaf, and a bottle of oil to &s;upply my lamp.</P>
<P>With a de&s;pondent eye did I examine this &s;cene of &s;uffering: when I reflected that I was doomed to pa&s;s in it the remainder of my days, my heart was rent with bitter angui&s;h. I had once been taught to look forward to a lot &s;o different! At one time my pro&s;pects had appeared &s;o bright, &s;o flattering! Now all was lo&s;t to me. Friends, comfort, &s;ociety, hap|pine&s;s,
<PB N="216" REF="035729_0471_10065B8D5D687528">
in one moment I was deprived of all! Dead to the world, dead to plea&s;ure, I lived to nothing but the &s;en&s;e of mi&s;ery. How fair did that world &s;eem to me, from which I was for ever excluded! How many loved objects did it contain, whom I never &s;hould behold again! As I threw a look of terror round my pri&s;on, as I &s;hrunk from the cutting wind which howled through my &s;ubterraneous dwelling, the change &s;eemed &s;o &s;triking, &s;o abrupt, that I doubt|ed its reality. That the duke de Medina's niece, that the de&s;tined bride of the marquis de las Ci&s;ternas, one bred up in affluence, related to the noble&s;t families in Spain, and rich in a multitude of affectionate friends&mdash;that &s;he &s;hould in one moment become a captive, &s;ep|arated from the world for ever, weighed down with chains, and reduced to &s;upport life with the coar&s;e&s;t al|iments&mdash;appeared a change &s;o &s;udden and incredible, that I believed my&s;elf the &s;port of &s;ome frightful vi&s;ion. Its continuance convinced me of my mi&s;take with but too much certainty. Every morning I looked for &s;ome relief from my &s;ufferings: every morning my hopes were di&s;appointed. At length I abandoned all idea of e&s;caping, I re&s;igned my&s;elf to my fate, and only expected liberty when &s;he came the companion of death.</P>
<P>My mental angui&s;h, and the dreadful &s;cenes in which I had been an actre&s;s, advanced the period of my labour. In &s;olitude and mi&s;ery, abandoned by all, una&s;&s;i&s;ted by art, uncomforted by friend&s;hip, with pangs which if witne&s;&s;ed would have touched the hard|e&s;t heart, was I delivered of my wretched burden. It came alive into the world; but I knew not how to treat it, or by what means to pre&s;erve its exi&s;tence.
<PB N="217" REF="035729_0472_10065BC5942DA640">
I could only bathe it with tears, warm it in my bo&s;om, and offer up prayers for its &s;afety. I was &s;oon de|prived of this mournful employment: the want of proper attendance, my ignorance how to nur&s;e it, the bitter cold of the dungeon, and the unwhole&s;ome air which inflated its lungs, terminated my &s;weet babe's &s;hort and painful exi&s;tence. It expired in a few hours after its birth, and I witne&s;&s;ed its death with agonies which beggar all de&s;cription.</P>
<P>But my grief was unavailing. My infant was no more: nor could all my &s;ighs impart to its little ten|der frame the breath of a moment. I rent my wind|ing &s;heet, and wrapped in it my lovely child. I plac|ed it on my bo&s;om, its &s;oft arm folded round my neck, and its pale cold cheek re&s;ting upon mine. Thus did its lifele&s;s limbs repo&s;e, while I covered it with ki&s;&s;es, talked to it, wept, and moaned over it without remi&s;|&s;ion day or night. Camilla entered my pri&s;on regu|larly once every twenty-four hours to bring me food. In &s;pite of her flinty nature, &s;he could not behold this &s;pectacle unmoved. She feared that grief &s;o exce&s;&s;ive would at length turn my brain; and in truth I was not always in my proper &s;en&s;es. From a principle of compa&s;&s;ion &s;he urged me to permit the cor&s;e to be bu|ried; but to this I never would con&s;ent. I vowed not to part with it while I had life: its pre&s;ence was my only comfort, and no per&s;ua&s;ion could induce me to give it up. It &s;oon became a ma&s;s of putridity, and to every eye was a loath&s;ome and di&s;gu&s;ting object, to every eye but a mother's. In vain did human feel|ings bid me recoil from this emblem of mortality with repugnance. I with&s;tood, and vanqui&s;hed that re|pugnance. I per&s;i&s;ted in holding my infant to my
<PB N="218" REF="035729_0473_10065B8EE4B5A0F8">
bo&s;om, in lamenting it, loving it, adoring it! Hour after hour have I pa&s;&s;ed upon my &s;orry couch, con|templating what had once been my child. I endea|voured to retrace its features through the livid corrup|tion with which they were over&s;pread. During my confinement, this &s;ad occupation was my only delight; and at that time worlds &s;hould not have bribed me to give it up. Even when relea&s;ed from my pri&s;on, I brought away my child in my arms. The repre&s;ent|ations of my too kind friends, [Here &s;he took the hands of the marchione&s;s and Virginia, and pre&s;&s;ed them alternately to her lips] at length per&s;uaded me to re&s;ign my unhappy infant to the grave. Yet I parted from it with reluctance. However, rea&s;on at length prevailed; I &s;uffered it to be taken from me, and it now repo&s;es in con&s;ecrated earth.</P>
<P>I before mentioned, that regularly once a day Ca|milla brought me food. She &s;ought not to embitter my &s;orrows with reproach. She bade me, 'tis true, re|&s;ign all hopes of liberty and worldly happine&s;s; but &s;he encouraged me to bear with patience my tempo|rary di&s;tre&s;s, and advi&s;ed me to draw comfort from re|ligion. My &s;ituation evidently affected her more than &s;he ventured to expre&s;s; but &s;he believed that to ex|tenuate my fault would make me le&s;s anxious to re|pent it. Often, while her lips painted the enormity of my guilt in glaring colours, her eyes betrayed how &s;en&s;ible &s;he was to my &s;ufferings. In fact, I am cer|tain that none of my tormentors (for the three other nuns entered my pri&s;on occa&s;ionally) were &s;o much actuated by the &s;pirit of oppre&s;&s;ive cruelty, as by the idea that to afflict my body was the only way to pre|&s;erve my &s;oul. Nay, even this per&s;ua&s;ion might not

have had &s;uch weight with them, and they might have thought my puni&s;hment too &s;evere, had not their good di&s;po&s;itions been repre&s;&s;ed by blind obedience to their &s;uperior. Her re&s;entment exi&s;ted in full force. My project of elopement having been di&s;covered by the abbot of the Capuchins, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed her&s;elf lowered in his opinion by my di&s;grace, and in con&s;equence her hate was inveterate. She told the nuns to who&s;e cu&s;tody I was committed, that my fault was of the mo&s;t heinous nature, that no &s;ufferings could equal the offence, and that nothing could &s;ave me from eternal perdition but puni&s;hing my guilt with the ut|mo&s;t &s;everity. The &s;uperior's word is an oracle to but too many of a convent's inhabitants. The nuns believed whatever the priore&s;s cho&s;e to a&s;&s;ert: though contradicted by rea&s;on and charity, they he&s;itated not to admit the truth of her arguments. They followed her injunctions to the very letter, and were fully per|&s;uaded, that to treat me with lenity, or to &s;hew the lea&s;t pity for my woes, would be a direct means to de&s;troy my chance for &s;alvation.</P>
<P>Camilla being thus employed about me, was par|ticularly charged by the priore&s;s to treat me with har&s;hne&s;s. In compliance with the&s;e orders, &s;he fre|quently &s;trove to convince me how ju&s;t was my puni&s;h|ment, and how enormous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s my crime. She bade me think my&s;elf too happy in &s;aving my &s;oul by mor|tifying my body, and even threatened me &s;ometimes with eternal perdition. Yet, as I before ob&s;erved, &s;he always concluded by words of encouragement and comfort; and though uttered by Camilla's lips, I ea&s;ily recogni&s;ed the domina's expre&s;&s;ions. Once, and once only, the priore&s;s vi&s;ited me in my dungeon.
<PB N="220" REF="035729_0475_10065B938A102048">
She then treated me with the mo&s;t unrelenting cruelty. She loaded me with reproaches, taunted me with my frailty; and, when I implored her mercy, told me to a&s;k it of Heaven, &s;ince I de&s;erved none on earth. She even gazed upon my lifele&s;s infant without emotion; and when &s;he left me, I heard her charge Camilla to increa&s;e the hard&s;hips of my captivity. Unfeeling woman! But let me check my re&s;entment. She has expiated her errors by her &s;ad and unexpected death. Peace be with her! and may her crimes be forgiven in Heaven, as I forgive her my &s;ufferings on earth!</P>
<P>Thus did I drag on a mi&s;erable exi&s;tence. Far from growing familiar with my pri&s;on, I beheld it every moment with new horror. The cold &s;eemed more piercing and bitter, the air more thick and pe&s;|tilential. My frame became weak, feveri&s;h, and emaciated. I was unable to ri&s;e from my bed of &s;traw, and exerci&s;e my limbs in the narrow limits to which the length of my chain permitted me to move. Though exhau&s;ted, faint, and weary, I trembled to profit by the approach of &s;leep. My &s;lumbers were con&s;tantly interrupted by &s;ome obnoxious in&s;ect crawl|ing over me. Sometimes I felt the bloated toad, hideous and pampered with the poi&s;onous vapours of the dungeon, dragging his loath&s;ome length along my bo&s;om. Sometimes the quick cold lizard rou&s;ed me, leaving his &s;limy track upon my face, and entangling it&s;elf in the tre&s;&s;es of my wild and matted hair. Of|ten have I at waking found my fingers ringed with the long worms which bred in the corrupted fle&s;h of my infant. At &s;uch times I &s;hrieked with terror and di&s;gu&s;t; and, while I &s;hook off the reptile, trembled with all a woman's weakne&s;s.</P>

Such was my &s;ituation when Camilla was &s;uddenly taken ill. A dangerous fever, &s;uppo&s;ed to be infec|tious, confined her to her bed. Every one, except the lay &s;i&s;ter appointed to nur&s;e her, avoided her with caution, and feared to catch the di&s;ea&s;e. She was per|fectly delirious, and by no means capable of attending to me. The domina, and the nuns admitted to the my&s;tery, had latterly entirely given me over to Camil|la's care. In con&s;equence, they bu&s;ied them&s;elves no more about me; and, occupied by preparing for the approaching fe&s;tival, it is more than probable that I never once entered into their thoughts. Of the rea|&s;on of Camilla's negligence I have been informed &s;ince my relea&s;e by the mother St. Ur&s;ula. At that time I was very far from &s;u&s;pecting its cau&s;e. On the contrary, I waited for my gaoler's appearance at fir&s;t with impatience, and afterwards with de&s;pair. One day pa&s;&s;ed away: another followed it: the third ar|rived. Still no Camilla! &s;till no food! I knew the lap&s;e of time by the wa&s;ting of my lamp, to feed which, fortunately a week's &s;upply of oil had been left me. I &s;uppo&s;ed, either that the nuns had forgotten me, or that the domina had ordered them to let me peri&s;h. The latter idea &s;eemed the mo&s;t probable: yet &s;o natural is the love of life, that I trembled to find it true. Though embittered by every &s;pecies of mi&s;ery, my exi&s;tence was &s;till dear to me, and I dreaded to lo&s;e it. Every &s;ucceeding minute proved to me that I mu&s;t abandon all hopes of relief. I was become an ab&s;olute &s;keleton: my eyes already failed me, and my limbs were beginning to &s;tiffen. I could only expre&s;s my angui&s;h, and the pangs of that hunger which gnawed my heart &s;trings, by frequent groans,

who&s;e melancholy &s;ound the vaulted roof of the dun|geon reechoed. I re&s;igned my&s;elf to my fate: I al|ready expected the moment of di&s;&s;olution, when my guardian angel&mdash;when my beloved brother arrived in time to &s;ave me. My &s;ight, grown dim and feeble, at fir&s;t refu&s;ed to recogni&s;e him: and when I did di&s;tin|gui&s;h his features, the &s;udden bur&s;t of rapture was too much for me to bear. I was overpowered by the &s;well of joy at once more beholding a friend, and that a friend &s;o dear to me. Nature could not &s;up|port my emotions, and took her refuge in in&s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>You already know what are my obligations to the family of Villa Franca. But what you cannot know, is the extent or my gratitude, boundle&s;s as the ex|cellence of my benefactors. Lorenzo! Raymond! names &s;o dear to me! teach me to bear with fortitude this &s;udden tran&s;ition from mi&s;ery to bli&s;s. So lately a captive, oppre&s;&s;ed with chains, peri&s;hing with hun|ger, &s;uffering every inconvenience of cold and want, hidden from the light, excluded from &s;ociety, hope|le&s;s, neglected, and, as I feared, forgotten: now re|&s;tored to life and liberty, enjoying all the comforts of affluence and ea&s;e, &s;urrounded by tho&s;e who are mo&s;t loved by me, and on the point of becoming his bride who has long been wedded to my heart, my happi|ne&s;s is &s;o exqui&s;ite, &s;o perfect, that &s;carcely can my brain &s;u&s;tain the weight. One only wi&s;h remains ungratified. It is to &s;ee my brother in his former health, and to know that Antonia's memory is buried in her grave. Granted this prayer, I have nothing more to de&s;ire. I tru&s;t that my pa&s;t &s;ufferings have purcha&s;ed from Heaven the pardon of my momentary weakne&s;s. That I have offended, offended greatly
<PB N="223" REF="035729_0478_10065BCD3A5FF840">
and grievou&s;ly, I am fully con&s;cious. But let not my hu&s;band, becau&s;e he once conquered my virtue, doubt the propriety of my future conduct. I have been frail and full of error: but I yielded not to the warmth of con&s;titution. Raymond, affection for you betrayed me. I was too confident of my &s;trength: but I depended no le&s;s on your honor than on my own. I had vowed never to &s;ee you more. Had it not been for the con&s;equences of that unguarded mo|ment my re&s;olution had been kept. Fate willed it otherwi&s;e, and I cannot but rejoice at its decree. Still my conduct has been highly blameable; and while I attempt to ju&s;tify my&s;elf, I blu&s;h at recol|lecting my imprudence. Let me then di&s;mi&s;s the ungrateful &s;ubject; fir&s;t a&s;&s;uring you Raymond, that you &s;hall have no cau&s;e to repent our union, and that, the more culpable have been the errors of your mi&s;|tre&s;s, the more exemplary &s;hall be the conduct of your wife.</P>

<P>Here Agnes cea&s;ed; and the marquis replied to her addre&s;s in terms equally &s;incere and affectionate. Lorenzo expre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction at the pro&s;pect of being &s;o clo&s;ely connected with a man for whom he had ever entertained the highe&s;t e&s;teem. The Pope's bull had fully and effectually relea&s;ed Agnes from her religious engagements. The marriage was therefore celebrated as &s;oon as the needful preparations had been made: for the marquis wi&s;hed to have the cer|emony performed with all po&s;&s;ible &s;plendour and pub|licity. This being over, and the bride having receiv|ed the compliments of Madrid, &s;he departed with
<PB N="224" REF="035729_0479_10065B95121E5610">
Don Raymond for his ca&s;tle in Andalu&s;ia. Lorenzo accompanied them, as did al&s;o the marchione&s;s de Villa Franca and her lovely daughter. It is needle&s;s to &s;ay that Theodore was of the party, and would be impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe his joy at his ma&s;ter's marriage. Previous to his departure, the marquis, to atone in &s;ome mea&s;ure for his pa&s;t neglect, made &s;ome inqui|ries relative to Elvira. Finding that &s;he, as well as her daughter, had received many &s;ervices from Leo|nella and Jacintha, he &s;hewed his re&s;pect to the me|mory of his &s;i&s;ter in law by making the two women hand&s;ome pre&s;ents. Lorenzo followed his example. Leonella was highly flattered by the attentions of noblemen &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed, and Jacintha ble&s;&s;ed the hour on which her hou&s;e was bewitched.</P>
<P>On her &s;ide, Agnes failed not to reward her con|vent friends. The worthy mother St. Ur&s;ula, to whom &s;he owed her liberty, was named, at her reque&s;t, &s;uperintendant of "the ladies of Charity." This was one of the be&s;t and mo&s;t opulent &s;ocieties throughout Spain. Bertha and Cornelia, not choo&s;|ing to quit their friend, were appointed to principal charges in the &s;ame e&s;tabli&s;hment. As to the nuns who had aided the domina in per&s;ecuting Agnes; Camilla, being confined by illne&s;s to her bed, had per|i&s;hed in the flames which con&s;umed St. Clare's con|vent. Mariana, Alix, and Violante, as well as two more, had fallen victims to the popular rage. The three others, who had in council &s;upported the domi|na's &s;entence, were &s;everely reprimanded, and ban|i&s;hed to religious hou&s;es in ob&s;cure and di&s;tant prov|inces. Here they langui&s;hed away a few years, a&s;ham|ed
<PB N="225" REF="035729_0480_10065BCF02FB5228">
of their former weakne&s;s, and &s;hunned by their companions with aver&s;ion and contempt.</P>
<P>Nor was the fidelity of Flora permitted to go un|rewarded. Her wi&s;hes being con&s;ulted, &s;he declared her&s;elf impatient to revi&s;it her native land. In con&s;e|quence, a pa&s;&s;age was procured for her to Cuba, where &s;he arrived in &s;afety, loaded with the pre&s;ents of Raymond and Lorenzo.</P>
<P>The debts of gratitude di&s;charged, Agnes was at liberty to pur&s;ue her favourite plan. Lodged in the &s;ame hou&s;e, Lorenzo and Virginia were eternally to|gether. The more he &s;aw of her, the more was he convinced of her merit. On her part, &s;he laid her|&s;elf out to plea&s;e; and not to &s;ucceed was for her impo&s;&s;ible. Lorenzo witne&s;&s;ed with admiration her beautiful per&s;on, elegant manners, innumerable tal|ents, and &s;weet di&s;po&s;ition. He was al&s;o much flat|tered by her prejudice in his favour, which &s;he had not &s;ufficient art to conceal. However, his &s;entiments partook not of that ardent character which had mark|ed his affection for Antonia. The image of that lovely and unfortunate girl &s;till lived in his heart, and baffled all Virginia's efforts to di&s;place it. Still, when the duke propo&s;ed to him the match, which he wi&s;h|ed &s;o earne&s;tly to take place, his nephew did not re|ject the offer. The urgent &s;upplications of his friends and the lady's merit, conquered his repugnance to en|tering into new engagements. He propo&s;ed him&s;elf to the marquis de Villa Franca, and was accepted with joy and gratitude. Virginia became his wife, nor did &s;he ever give him cau&s;e to repent his choice. His e&s;teem increa&s;ed for her daily. Her unremitted en|deavours
<PB N="226" REF="035729_0481_10065B969A6B7938">
to plea&s;e him could not but &s;ucceed. His affection a&s;&s;umed &s;tronger and warmer colours. An|tonia's image was gradually effaced from his bo&s;om, and, Virginia became &s;ole mi&s;tre&s;s of that heart, which &s;he well de&s;erved to po&s;&s;e&s;s without a partner.</P>
<P>The remaining years of Raymond and Agnes, of Lorenzo and Virginia, were happy as can be tho&s;e allotted to mortals, born to be the prey of grief, and &s;port of di&s;appointment. The exqui&s;ite &s;orrows with which they had been afflicted, made them think light|ly of every &s;ucceeding woe. They had felt the &s;harp|e&s;t darts in misfortune's quiver. Tho&s;e which re|mained, appeared blunt in compari&s;on. Having weathered fate's heavie&s;t &s;torms, they looked calmly upon its terrors: or, if ever they felt affliction's ca&s;|ual gales, they &s;eemed to them gentle as zephyrs which breathe over &s;ummer &s;eas.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ON the day following Antonia's death, all Madrid was a &s;cene of con&s;ternation and amazement. An archer, who had witne&s;&s;ed the adventure in the &s;epulchre, had indi&s;creetly related the circum&s;tances of the murder: he had al&s;o named the perpetrator. The confu&s;ion was without example, which this in|telligence rai&s;ed among the devotees. Mo&s;t of them di&s;believed it, and went them&s;elves to the abbey to a&s;|certain the fact. Anxious to avoid the &s;hame to which their &s;uperior's ill conduct expo&s;ed the whole brotherhood, the monks a&s;&s;ured the vi&s;itors, that Am|bro&s;io was prevented from receiving them as u&s;ual by nothing but illne&s;s. This attempt was un&s;ucce&s;sful. The &s;ame excu&s;e being repeated day after day, the archer's &s;tory gradually obtained confidence. The abbot's parti&s;ans abandoned him: no one entertained a doubt of his guilt: and they who before had been the warme&s;t in his prai&s;e, were now the mo&s;t vocife|rous in his condemnation.</P>
<P>While his innocence or guilt was debated in Ma|drid with the utmo&s;t acrimony, Ambro&s;io was a prey to the pangs of con&s;cious villainy, and the terrors of puni&s;hment impending over him. When he looked back to the eminence on which he had lately &s;tood, univer&s;ally honoured and re&s;pected, at peace with the world and with him&s;elf, &s;carcely could he believe that
<PB N="228" REF="035729_0483_10065B98A5F698F0">
he was indeed the culprit, who&s;e crimes and who&s;e probable fate he trembled to con&s;ider. But a few weeks had elap&s;ed, &s;ince he was pure and virtuous, courted by the wi&s;e&s;t and noble&s;t in Madrid, and re|garded by the people with a reverence that approach|ed idolatry. He now &s;aw him&s;elf &s;tained with the mo&s;t loathed and mon&s;trous &s;ins, the object of univer|&s;al execration, a pri&s;oner of the Holy Office, and pro|bably doomed to peri&s;h in tortures the mo&s;t &s;evere. He could not hope to deceive his judges: the proofs of his guilt were too &s;tong. His pre&s;ence in the &s;e|pulchre at &s;o late an hour, his confu&s;ion at the di&s;cov|ery, the dagger which in his fir&s;t alarm he owned had been concealed by him, and the blood which had &s;pirted upon his habit from Antonia's wound, &s;uffi|ciently marked him out for the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. He waited with agony for the day of examination. He had no re&s;ource to comfort him in his di&s;tre&s;s. Religion could not in&s;pire him with fortitude. If he read the books of morality which were put into his hands, he &s;aw in them nothing but the enormity of his of|fences. If he attempted to pray, he recollected that he de&s;erved not Heaven's protection, and believed his crimes &s;o mon&s;trous as to exceed even God's infinite goodne&s;s. For every other &s;inner he thought there might be hope, but for him there could be none. Shuddering at the pa&s;t, angui&s;hed by the pre&s;ent, and dreading the future, thus pa&s;&s;ed he the few days pre|ceding that which was marked for his trial.</P>
<P>That day arrived. At nine in the morning his pri&s;|on door was unlocked, and his gaoler entering com|manded him to follow him. He obeyed with trem|bling. He was conducted into a &s;pacious hall hung
<PB N="229" REF="035729_0484_10065BD4DCBBC238">
with black cloth. At the table &s;at three grave &s;tern looking men, al&s;o habited in black: one was the Grand Inqui&s;itor, whom the importance of this cau&s;e had induced to examine into it him&s;elf. At a &s;mall|er table at a little di&s;tance &s;at the &s;ecretary, provided with all nece&s;&s;ary implements for writing. Ambro&s;io was beckoned to advance, and take his &s;tation at the lower end of the table. As his eye glanced down|wards, he perceived various iron in&s;truments lying &s;cattered upon the floor. Their forms were unknown to him, but apprehen&s;ion immediately gue&s;&s;ed them to be engines of torture. He turned pale, and with difficulty prevented him&s;elf from &s;inking upon the ground.</P>
<P>Profound &s;ilence prevailed, except when the inqui&s;|itors whi&s;pered a few words among them&s;elves my&s;|teriou&s;ly. Near an hour pa&s;&s;ed away, and with every &s;econd of it Ambro&s;io's fears grew more poignant. At length a &s;mall door, oppo&s;ite to that by which he had entered the hall, grated heavily upon its hinges. An officer appeared, and was immediately followed by the beautiful Matilda. Her hair hung about her face wildly: her cheeks were pale, and her eyes &s;unk and hollow. She threw a melancholy look upon Am|bro&s;io: he replied by one of aver&s;ion and reproach. She was placed oppo&s;ite to him. A bell then &s;ound|ed thrice. It was the &s;ignal for opening the court; and the inqui&s;itors entered upon their office.</P>
<P>In the&s;e trials, neither the accu&s;ation is mentioned, nor the name of the accu&s;er. The pri&s;oners are only a&s;ked, whether they will confe&s;s. If they reply, that, having no crime, they can make no confe&s;&s;ion, they are put to the torture without delay. This is re|peated
<PB N="230" REF="035729_0485_100834EE4CA7E610">
at intervals, either till the &s;u&s;pected avow them&s;elves culpable, or the per&s;everance of the ex|aminants is worn out and exhau&s;ted: but without a direct acknowledgment of their guilt, the Inqui&s;ition never pronounces the final doom of its pri&s;oners. In general, much time is &s;uffered to elap&s;e without their being que&s;tioned; but Ambro&s;io's trial had been ha&s;|tened on account of a &s;olemn Auto da F&eacute; which would take place in a few days, and in which the inqui&s;itors meant this di&s;tingui&s;hed culprit to perform a part, and give a &s;triking te&s;timony of their vigilance.</P>
<P>The abbot was not merely accu&s;ed of rape and mur|der; the crime of &s;orcery was laid to his charge, as well as to Matilda's. She had been &s;eized as an ac|complice in Antonia's a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. On &s;earching her cell, various &s;u&s;picious books and in&s;truments were found, which ju&s;tified the accu&s;ation brought again&s;t her. To criminate the monk, the con&s;tellated mirror was produced, which Matilda had accidentally left in his chamber. The &s;trange figures engraved upon it caught the attention of Don Ramirez, while &s;earching the abbot's cell; in con&s;equence, he carried it away with him. It was &s;hewn to the Grand In|qui&s;itor, who, having con&s;idered it for &s;ome time, took off a &s;mall golden cro&s;s which hung at his girdle, and laid it upon the mirror. In&s;tantly a loud noi&s;e was heard re&s;embling a clap of thunder, and the &s;teel &s;hivered into a thou&s;and pieces. This circum&s;tance confirmed the &s;u&s;picion of the monk's having dealt in magic. It was even &s;uppo&s;ed, that his former influ|ence over the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ds of the people was entirely to be a&s;cribed to witchcraft.</P>
<P>Determined to make him confe&s;s not only the crimes which he had committed, but tho&s;e al&s;o of
<PB N="231" REF="035729_0486_10065BD664921F20">
which he was innocent, the inqui&s;itors began their examination. Though dreading the tortures, as he yet more dreaded death, which would con&s;ign him to eternal torments, the abbot a&s;&s;erted his purity in a voice bold and re&s;olute. Matilda followed his exam|ple, but &s;poke with fear and trembling. Having in vain exhorted him to confe&s;s, the inqui&s;itors ordered the monk to be put to the que&s;tion. The decree was immediately executed. Ambro&s;io &s;uffered the mo&s;t excruciating pangs that ever were invented by human cruelty. Yet &s;o dreadful is death, when guilt accom|panies it, that he had &s;ufficient fortitude to per&s;i&s;t in his di&s;avowal. His agonies were redoubled in con&s;e|quence; nor was he relea&s;ed till fainting from exce&s;s of pain, in&s;en&s;ibility re&s;cued him from the hands of his tormentors.</P>
<P>Matilda was next ordered to the torture; but, ter|rified by the &s;ight of the friar's &s;ufferings, her courage totally de&s;erted her. She &s;unk upon her knees, ac|knowledged her corre&s;ponding with infernal &s;pirits, and that &s;he had witne&s;&s;ed the monk's a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of Antonia; but as to the crime of &s;orcery, &s;he declared her&s;elf the &s;ole criminal, and Ambro&s;io perfectly in|nocent. The latter a&s;&s;ertion met with no credit. The abbot had recovered his &s;en&s;es in time to hear the confe&s;&s;ion of his accomplice; but he was too much enfeebled by what he had already undergone, to be ca|pable at that time of &s;u&s;taining new torments. He was commanded back to his cell, but fir&s;t informed, that as &s;oon as he had gained &s;trength &s;ufficient he mu&s;t prepare him&s;elf for a &s;econd examination. The inqui&s;itors hoped that he would then be le&s;s hardened and ob&s;tinate. To Matilda it was announced, that
<PB N="232" REF="035729_0487_10065B9D986D3068">
&s;he mu&s;t expiate her crimes in fire on the approaching Auto da F&ecirc;. All her tears and entreaties could pro|cure no mitigation of her doom, and &s;he was dragged by force from the hall of trial.</P>
<P>Returned to his dungeon, the &s;ufferings of Ambro|&s;io's body were far more &s;upportable than tho&s;e of his mind. His di&s;located limbs, the nails torn from his hands and feet, and his fingers ma&s;hed and broken by the pre&s;&s;ure of &s;crews, were far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed in angui&s;h by the agitation of his &s;oul and vehemence of his ter|rors. He &s;aw that, guilty or innocent, his judges were bent upon condemning him. The remembrance of what his denial had already co&s;t him, terrified him at the idea of being again applied to the que&s;tion, and almo&s;t engaged him to confe&s;s his crimes. Then again the con&s;equences of his confe&s;&s;ion fla&s;hed before him, and rendered him once more irre&s;olute. His death would be inevitable, and that a death the mo&s;t dreadful. He had li&s;tened to Matilda's doom, and doubted not that a &s;imilar was re&s;erved for him. He &s;huddered at the approaching Auto da F&eacute;, at the idea of peri&s;hing in flames, and only e&s;caping from endura|ble torments to pa&s;s into others more &s;ubtile and ever|la&s;ting! With affright did he bend his mind's eye on the &s;pace beyond the grave; nor could hide from him|&s;elf how ju&s;tly he ought to dread Heaven's vengeance. In this labyri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> of terrors, fain would he have taken his refuge in the gloom of athei&s;m; fain would he have denied the &s;oul's immortality; have per&s;uaded him&s;elf that, his eyes once clo&s;ed, they would never more open, and that the &s;ame moment would anni|hilate his &s;oul and body. Even this re&s;ource was refu&s;ed to him. To permit his being blind to the fal|lacy
<PB N="233" REF="035729_0488_10065BD868609410">
of this belief, his knowledge was too exten&s;ive, his under&s;tanding too &s;olid and ju&s;t. He could not help feeling the exi&s;tence of a God. Tho&s;e truths, once his comfort, now pre&s;ented them&s;elves before him in the cleare&s;t light; but they only &s;erved to drive him to di&s;traction. They de&s;troyed his ill grounded hopes of e&s;caping puni&s;hment; and, di&s;pelled by the irre&s;i&s;tible brightne&s;s of truth and conviction, philo&s;o|phy's deceitful vapours faded away like a dream.</P>
<P>In angui&s;h almo&s;t too great for mortal frame to bear, he expected the time when he was again to be examined. He bu&s;ied him&s;elf in planning ineffectual &s;chemes for e&s;caping both pre&s;ent and future puni&s;h|ment. Of the fir&s;t there was no po&s;&s;ibility; of the &s;econd de&s;pair made him neglect the only means. While Rea&s;on forced him to acknowledge a God's exi&s;tence, Con&s;cience made him doubt the infinity of his goodne&s;s. He di&s;believed that a &s;inner like him|&s;elf could find mercy. He had not been deceived into error; ignorance could furni&s;h him with no excu&s;e. He had &s;een vice in her true colours. Before he com|mitted his crimes, he had computed every &s;cruple of their weight, and yet he had committed them.</P>

<P>Per&s;uaded of this, in&s;tead of humbling him&s;elf in penitence, of deploring his guilt, and employing his few remaining hours in deprecating Heaven's wrath, he abandoned him&s;elf to the tran&s;ports of de&s;perate rage; he &s;orrowed for the puni&s;hment of his crimes, not their commi&s;&s;ion; and exhaled his bo&s;om's an|gui&s;h in idle &s;ighs, in vain lamentations, in bla&s;phemy

and de&s;pair. As the few beams of day which pierced through the bars of his pri&s;on window gradually di&s;|appeared, and their place was &s;upplied by the pale and glimmering lamp, he felt his terrors redouble, and his ideas become more gloomy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;olemn, more de&s;pondent. He dreaded the approach of &s;leep. No &s;ooner did his eyes clo&s;e, wearied with tears and watching, than the dreadful vi&s;ions &s;eemed to be real|i&s;ed on which his mind had dwelt during the day. He found him&s;elf in &s;ulphurous realms and burning caverns, &s;urrounded by fiends appointed his torment|ors, and who drove him through a variety of tortures, each of which was more dreadful than the former. Amid&s;t the&s;e di&s;mal &s;cenes wandered the gho&s;ts of Elvira and her daughter. They reproached him with their deaths, recounted his crimes to the daemons, and urged them to inflict torments of cruelty yet more re|fined. Such were the pictures which floated before his eyes in &s;leep: they vani&s;hed not till his repo&s;e was di&s;turbed by exce&s;s of agony. Then would he &s;tart from the ground on which he had &s;tretched him&s;elf, his brows running down with cold &s;weat, his eyes wild and phren&s;ied; and he only exchanged the terri|ble certainty for &s;urmi&s;es &s;carcely more &s;upportable. He paced his dungeon with di&s;ordered &s;teps; he gazed with terror upon the &s;urrounding darkne&s;s, and often did he cry,</P>
<P>"Oh! fearful is night to the guilty."</P>
<P>The day of his &s;econd examination was at hand. He had been compelled to &s;wallow cordials, who&s;e virtues were calculated to re&s;tore his bodily &s;trength, and enable him to &s;upport the que&s;tion longer. On the night preceding this dreaded day, his fears for the

He &s;at like one &s;tupefied near the table on which his lamp was burning dimly. De&s;pair chained up his faculties in idioti&s;m, and he remained for &s;ome hours unable to &s;peak or move, or indeed to think.</P>
<P>"Look up, Ambro&s;io!" &s;aid a voice in accents well known to him.</P>
<P>The monk &s;tarted, and rai&s;ed his melancholy eyes. Matilda &s;tood before him. She had quitted her re|ligious habit. She now wore a female dre&s;s, at once elegant and &s;plendid; a profu&s;ion of diamonds blazed upon her robes, and her hair was confined by a coro|net of ro&s;es. In her right hand &s;he held a &s;mall book: a lively expre&s;&s;ion of plea&s;ure beamed upon her countenance&mdash;but &s;till it was mingled with a wild imperious maje&s;ty, which in&s;pired the monk with awe, and repre&s;&s;ed in &s;ome mea&s;ure his tran&s;ports at &s;eeing her.</P>
<P>"You here, Matilda!" he at length exclaimed: "How have you gained entrance? Where are your chains? What means this magnificence, and the joy which &s;parkles in your eyes? Have our judges relent|ed? Is there a chance of my e&s;caping? An&s;wer me for pity, and tell me what I have to hope or fear."</P>
<P>"Ambro&s;io!" &s;he replied with an air of command|ing dignity: "I have baffled the Inqui&s;ition's fury.

<P>She let the book fall upon the ground. A cloud of blue fire wrapped it&s;elf round her. She waved her hand to Ambro&s;io, and di&s;appeared. The momentary glare which the flames poured through the dungeon, on di&s;&s;ipating &s;uddenly, &s;eemed to have increa&s;ed its natural gloom. The &s;olitary lamp &s;carcely gave light &s;ufficient to guide the monk to a chair. He threw him&s;elf into his &s;eat, folded his arms, and, leaning his head upon the table, &s;unk into reflections perplexing and unconnected.</P>
<P>He was &s;till in this attitude, when the opening of the pri&s;on door rou&s;ed him from his &s;tupor. He was &s;ummoned to appear before the Grand Inqui&s;itor. He ro&s;e and followed his gaoler with painful &s;teps. He was led into the &s;ame hall, placed before the &s;ame examiners, and was again interrogated whether he would confe&s;s. He replied as before, that, having no crimes, he could acknowledge none. But when the executioners prepared to put him to the que&s;tion, when he &s;aw the engines of torture, and remembered the pangs which they had already inflicted, his re&s;o|lution failed him entirely. Forgetting the con&s;e|quences, and only anxious to e&s;cape the terrors of the pre&s;ent moment, he made an ample confe&s;&s;ion. He di&s;clo&s;ed every circum&s;tance of his guilt, and owned not merely the crimes with which he was charged, but tho&s;e of which he had never been &s;u&s;pected. Be|ing interrogated as to Matilda's flight, which had cre|ated much confu&s;ion; he confe&s;&s;ed that &s;he had &s;old her&s;elf to Satan, and that &s;he was indebted to &s;orcery
<PB N="240" REF="035729_0495_10065BEA18C1B138">
for her e&s;cape. He &s;till a&s;&s;ured his judges, that for his own part he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> never entered into any compact with the infernal &s;pirits; but the threat of being tor|tured made him declare him&s;elf to be a &s;orcerer and heretic, and whatever other titles the inqui&s;itors cho&s;e to fix upon him. In con&s;equence of this avowal, his &s;entence was immediately pronounced. He was or|dered to prepare him&s;elf to peri&s;h in the Auto da F&eacute;, which was to be &s;olemnized at twelve o'clock that night. This hour was cho&s;en, from the idea, that, the horror of the flames being heightened by the gloom of midnight, the execution would have a greater ef|fect upon the mind of the people.</P>
<P>Ambro&s;io, rather dead than alive, was left alone in his dungeon. The moment in which this terrible decree was pronounced, had nearly proved that of his di&s;&s;olution. He looked forward to the morrow with de&s;pair, and his terrors increa&s;ed with the approach of midnight. Sometimes he was buried in gloomy &s;ilence; at others, he raved with delirious pa&s;&s;ion, wrung his hands, and cur&s;ed the hour when he fir&s;t beheld the light. In one of the&s;e moments his eye re&s;ted upon Matilda's my&s;terious gift. His tran&s;ports of rage were in&s;tantly &s;u&s;pended. He looked earne&s;t|ly at the book, he took it up, but immediately threw it from him with horror. He walked rapidly up and down his dungeon&mdash;then &s;topped, and again fixed his eyes on the &s;pot where the book had fallen. He re|flected, that here at lea&s;t was a re&s;ource from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ate which he dreaded. He &s;tooped, and took it up a &s;econd time. He remained for &s;ome time trembling and irre&s;olute; he longed to try the charm, yet fear|ed its con&s;equences. The recollection of his &s;entence
<PB N="241" REF="035729_0496_10065BF21AA61520">
at length fixed his indeci&s;ion. He opened the volume; but his agitation was &s;o great, that he at fir&s;t &s;ought in vain for the page mentioned by Matilda. A&s;ham|ed of him&s;elf, he called all his courage to his aid. He turned to the &s;eventh leaf: he began to read it aloud; but his eyes frequently wondered from the book, while he anxiou&s;ly ca&s;t them round in &s;earch of the &s;pirit, whom he wi&s;hed, yet dreaded, to behold. Still he per&s;i&s;ted in his de&s;ign; and with a voice un|a&s;&s;ured, and frequent interruptions, he contrived to fini&s;h the four fir&s;t lines of the page.</P>
<P>They were in a language who&s;e import was totally unknown to him. Scarce had he pronounced the la&s;t word, when the effects of the charm were evident. A loud bur&s;t of thunder was heard, the pri&s;on &s;hook to its very foundations, a blaze of lightning fla&s;hed through the cell, and in the next moment, borne upon &s;ulphurous whirlwinds, Lucifer &s;tood before him a &s;econd time. But he came not as when at Matilda's &s;ummons he borrowed the &s;eraph's form to deceive Ambro&s;io. He appeared in all that ugline&s;s which &s;ince his fall from heaven had been his portion. His bla&s;ted limbs &s;till bore marks of the Almighty's thun|der. A &s;warthy darkne&s;s &s;pread it&s;elf over his gigan|tic form: his hands and feet were armed with long talons. Fury glared in his eyes, which might have &s;truck the brave&s;t heart with terror. Over his huge &s;houlders waved two enormous &s;able wings; and his hair was &s;upplied by living &s;nakes, which twined them&s;elves round his brows with frightful hi&s;&s;ings. In one hand he held a roll of parchment, and in the other an iron pen. Still the lightning fla&s;hed around him, and the thunder with repeated bur&s;ts &s;eemed to announce the di&s;&s;olution of Nature.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="035729_0497_10065BEBA1DD8288">
Terrified at an apparition &s;o different from what he had expected, Ambro&s;io remained gazing upon the fiend, deprived of the power of utterance. The thunder had cea&s;ed to roll: univer&s;al &s;ilence reigned through the dungeon.</P>
<P>"For what am I &s;ummoned hither?" &s;aid the dae|mon, in a voice which <HI>&s;ulphurous fogs had damped to hoar&s;ene&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>At the &s;ound Nature &s;eemed to tremble. A violent earthquake rocked the ground, accompanied by a fre&s;h bur&s;t of thunder, louder and more appalling than the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Ambro&s;io was long unable to an&s;wer the daemon's demand.</P>
<P>"I am condemned to die," he &s;aid with a faint voice, his blood running cold while he gazed upon his dreadful vi&s;itor. "Save me! bear me from hence!"</P>
<P>"Shall the reward of my &s;ervices be paid me? Dare you embrace my cau&s;e? Will you be mine, body and &s;oul? Are you prepared to renounce him who made you, and him who died for you? An&s;wer but 'Yes!' and Lucifer is your &s;lave."</P>

The pen was put into his hand: it trembled. The wretch placed the parchment on the table before him, and prepared to &s;ign it. Suddenly he held his hand: he &s;tarted away ha&s;tily, and threw the pen upon the table.</P>
<P>"What am I doing?" he cried. Then turning to the fiend with a de&s;perate air, "Leave me! be|gone! I will not &s;ign the parchment"</P>

enemy: but as the hour of puni&s;hment drew near, his former terrors revived in his heart. Their momentary repo&s;e &s;eemed to have given them fre&s;h vigour. The nearer that the time approached, the more did he dread appearing before the throne of God. He &s;huddered to think how &s;oon he mu&s;t be plunged into eternity&mdash;how &s;oon meet the eyes of his Creator, whom he had &s;o grievou&s;ly offended. The bell an|nounced midnight.

He heard death and torture murmured in each &s;ucceeding &s;ound. He expected to &s;ee the archers entering his pri&s;on; and as the bell forbore to toll, he &s;eized the magic volume in a fit of de&s;pair. He opened it, turned ha&s;tily to the &s;eventh page, and, as if fearing to allow him&s;elf a moment's thought, ran over the fatal lines with rapidity. Accompanied by his former terrors, Luci|fer again &s;tood before the trembler.</P>
<P>"You have &s;ummoned me," &s;aid the fiend. "Are you determined to be wi&s;e? Will you accept my con|ditions? You know them already.

<P>"I mu&s;t&mdash;Fate urges me&mdash;I accept your condi|tions."</P>
<P>"Sign the parchment," replied the daemon in an exulting tone.</P>
<P>The contract and the bloody pen &s;till lay upon the table. Ambro&s;io drew near it. He prepared to &s;ign his name. A moment's reflection made him he&s;itate.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="035729_0501_10063CBF4DAAB7E0">
"Hark!" cried the tempter: "they come. Be quick. Sign the parchment, and I bear you from hence this moment."</P>
<P>In effect, the archers were heard approaching, ap|pointed to lead Ambro&s;io to the &s;take. The &s;ound en|couraged the monk in his re&s;olution.</P>

<P>At this moment the bolt of the outward door was drawn back. The pri&s;oner heard the rattling of chains: the heavy bar fell: the archers were on the point of entering. Worked up to phren&s;y by the ur|gent danger, &s;hrinking from the approach of death, terrified by the daemon's threats, and &s;eeing no other means to e&s;cape de&s;truction, the wretched monk com|plied.

<P>"I have triumphed! You are mine pa&s;t reprieve, and I fufil my promi&s;e."</P>
<P>While he &s;poke, the door unclo&s;ed. In&s;tantly the daemon gra&s;ped one of Ambro&s;io's arms, &s;pread his broad pinions, and &s;prang with him into the air. The roof opened as they &s;oared upwards, and clo&s;ed again when they had quitted the dungeon.</P>
<P>In the mean while, the gaoler was thrown into the utmo&s;t &s;urpri&s;e by the di&s;appearance of his pri&s;oner. Though neither he nor the archers were in time to witne&s;s the monk's e&s;cape, a &s;ulphurous &s;mell prevail|ing through the pri&s;on &s;ufficiently informed them by who&s;e aid he had been liberated. They ha&s;tened to make their report to the Grand Inqui&s;itor. The &s;tory how a &s;orcerer had been carried away by the devil, was &s;oon noi&s;ed about Madrid; and for &s;ome days the whole city was employed in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the &s;ubject. Gradually it cea&s;ed to be the topic of conver&s;ation. Other adventures aro&s;e who&s;e novelty engaged univer&s;|al attention; and Ambro&s;io was &s;oon forgotten as to|tally
<PB N="248" REF="035729_0503_10065BF3A0F3B6F8">
as if he never had exi&s;ted. While this was pa&s;&s;|ing, the monk, &s;upported by his infernal guide, trav|er&s;ed the air with the rapidity of an arrow; and a few moments placed him upon a precipice's brink, the &s;teepe&s;t in Sierra Morena.</P>
<P>Though re&s;cued from the Inqui&s;ition, Ambro&s;io as yet was in&s;en&s;ible of the ble&s;&s;ings of liberty. The damning contract weighed heavy upon his mind; and the &s;cenes in which he had been a principal actor had left behind them &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions as rendered his heart the &s;eat of anarchy and confu&s;ion. The objects now before his eyes, and which the full moon &s;ailing through clouds permitted him to examine, were ill cal|culated to in&s;pire that calm, of which he &s;tood &s;o much in need. The di&s;order of his imagination was increa&s;ed by the wildne&s;s of the &s;urrounding &s;cenery; by the gloomy caverns and &s;teep rocks, ri&s;ing above each other, and dividing the pa&s;&s;ing clouds; &s;olitary clu&s;ters of trees &s;cattered here and there, among who&s;e thick twined branches the wind of night &s;ighed hoar&s;e|ly and mournfully; the &s;hrill cry of mountain eagles, who had built their ne&s;ts among the&s;e lonely de&s;erts; the &s;tunning roar of torrents, as &s;welled by late rains they ru&s;hed violently down tremendous precipices: and the dark waters of a &s;ilent &s;luggi&s;h &s;tream which faintly reflected the moon's beams, and bathed the rock's ba&s;e on which Ambro&s;io &s;tood. The abbot ca&s;t round him a look of terror. His infernal conductor was &s;till by his &s;ide, and eyed him with a look of mingled malice, exultation and contempt.</P>
<P>"Whither have you brought me?" &s;aid the monk at length in an hollow trembling voice: "Why am I placed in this melancholy &s;cene? Bear me from it quickly! Carry me to Matilda!"</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="035729_0504_10065BE3F7EACDD8">
The fiend replied not, but continued to gaze upon him in &s;ilence. Ambro&s;io could not &s;u&s;tain his glance; he turned away his eyes, while thus &s;poke the daemon:</P>
<P>"I have him then in my power! This model of piety! this being without reproach! this mortal who placed his puny virtues on a level with tho&s;e of angels. He is mine! irrevocably, eternally mine! Compan|ions of my &s;ufferings! denizens of hell! How grateful will be my pre&s;ent!"</P>
<P>He pau&s;ed, then addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the monk&mdash;</P>
<P>"Bear you to Matilda?" he continued, repeating Ambro&s;io's words: "Wretch! you &s;hall &s;oon be with her! You well de&s;erve a place near her, for hell boa&s;ts no mi&s;creant more guilty than your&s;elf. Hark, Ambro&s;io, while I unveil your crimes! You have &s;hed the blood of two innocents; Antonia and Elvira peri&s;hed by your hand. That Antonia whom you violated, was your &s;i&s;ter! that Elvira whom you mur|dered, gave you birth! Tremble, abandoned hypo|crite! inhuman parricide! ince&s;tuous ravi&s;her! trem|ble at the extent of your offences! And you it was who thought your&s;elf proof again&s;t temptation, ab|&s;olved from human frailties, and free from error and vice! Is pride then a virtue? Is inhumanity no fault? Know, vain man! that I long have marked you for my prey; I watched the movements of your heart; I &s;aw that you were virtuous from vanity, not principle, and I &s;eized the fit moment of &s;eduction. I ob&s;erved your blind idolatry of the Madona's picture. I bade a &s;ubordinate but crafty &s;pirit a&s;&s;ume a &s;imilar form, and you eagerly yielded to the blandi&s;hments of Matilda, Your pride was gratified by her flattery;
<PB N="250" REF="035729_0505_10065BF54DF08310">
your pa&s;&s;ions only needed an opportunity to break forth; you ran into the &s;nare blindly, and &s;crupled not to commit a crime, which you blamed in another with unfeeling &s;everity. It was I who threw Ma|tilda in your way; it was I who gave you entrance to Antonia's chamber; and it was I who cau&s;ed the dagger to be given you which pierced your &s;i&s;ter's bo|&s;om! Hear, hear, Ambro&s;io! <HI>Had you re&s;i&s;ted me one minute longer, you had &s;aved your body and &s;oul. The guards whom you heard at your pri&s;on door, came to &s;ig|nify your pardon.</HI> But I had already triumphed: my plots had already &s;ucceeded. Scarcely could I pro|po&s;e crimes &s;o quick as you performed them. You are mine, and Heaven it&s;elf cannot re&s;cue you from my power. Hope not that your penitence will make void our contract. Here is your bond &s;igned with your blood; you have given up your claim to mercy, and nothing can re&s;tore you to the rights which you have fooli&s;hly re&s;igned. Believe you that your &s;ecret thoughts e&s;caped me? No, no, I read them all! You tru&s;ted that you &s;hould &s;till have time for repentance. I &s;aw your artifice, knew its fal&s;ity, and rejoiced in deceiving the deceiver! You are mine beyond re|prieve: I burn to po&s;&s;e&s;s my right, and alive you quit not the&s;e mountains."</P>
<P>During the daemon's &s;peech, Ambro&s;io had been &s;tupified by terror and &s;urpri&s;e. This la&s;t declara|tion rou&s;ed him.</P>
<P>"Not quit the&s;e mountains alive?" he exclaimed: "Perfidious, what mean you? Have you forgotten our contract?"</P>
<P>The fiend an&s;wered by a malicious laugh:</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="035729_0506_10065BE890777058">
"Our contract? Have I not performed my part? What more did I promi&s;e than to &s;ave you from your pri&s;on? Have I not done &s;o? Are you not &s;afe from the Inqui&s;ition&mdash;&s;afe from all but from me? Fool that you were to confide your&s;elf to a devil! Why did you not &s;tipulate for life, and power, and plea&s;|ure? Then all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ould have been granted: now your reflections come too late. Mi&s;creant, prepare for death; you have not many hours to live!"</P>
<P>On hearing this &s;entence, dreadful were the feel|ings of the devoted wretch! He &s;unk upon his knees, and rai&s;ed his hands towards heaven. The fiend read his intention and prevented it&mdash;</P>
<P>"What?" he cried, darting at him a look of fury: "Dare you &s;till implore the Eternal's mercy? Would you feign penitence, and again act an hypocrite's part? Villain, re&s;ign your hopes of pardon. Thus I &s;ecure my prey!"</P>
<P>As he &s;aid this, darting his talons into the monk's &s;haven crown, he &s;prang with him from the rock. The caves and mountains rang with Ambro&s;io's &s;hrieks. The daemon continued to &s;oar aloft, till, reaching a dreadful height, he relea&s;ed the &s;ufferer. Headlong fell the monk through the airy wa&s;te; the &s;harp point of a rock received him; and he rolled from preci|pice to precipice, till, brui&s;ed and mangled, he re&s;ted on the river's banks In&s;tantly a violent &s;torm aro&s;e: the winds in fury <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> up rocks and fore&s;ts: the &s;ky was now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with clouds, now &s;heeted with fire: the rain fell in torrents; it &s;welled the &s;tream; the waves overflowed their banks; they reached the &s;pot where Ambro&s;io lay, and, when they abated, carried
<PB N="252" REF="035729_0507_10065BF6D5DDDEB0">
with them into the river the cor&s;e of the de&s;pairing monk.</P>
<P>Haughty Lady, why &s;hrunk you back when yon poor frail one drew near? Was the air infected by her errors? Was your purity &s;oiled by her pa&s;&s;ing breath? Ah! Lady, &s;mooth that in&s;ulting brow: &s;tifle the reproach ju&s;t bur&s;ting from your &s;cornful lip: wound not a &s;oul that bleeds already! She has &s;uffered, &s;uffers &s;till. Her air is gay, but her heart is broken; her dre&s;s &s;parkles, but her bo&s;om groans.</P>
<P>Lady, to look with mercy on the conduct of others, is a virtue no le&s;s than to look with &s;everity on your own.</P>
