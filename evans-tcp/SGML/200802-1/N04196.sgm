<P>And <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> having received the Law from the Mouth and Hand of God, together with many Promi&s;es to allure, and Threatnings to awaken the People to Obe|dience, read it in their Audience; and they upon hearing it, promi&s;ed Obedience to it.<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><HI>Exod.</HI> 24. 7.</NOTE></P>
<P>And <HI>he</HI> not &s;huning to declare unto them all the Coun&s;el of God, approved him&s;elf faithful to God, and to his People, therefore God gave this Te&s;timony concerning him; <HI>My Servant</HI> Mo&s;es <HI>is faithful in all my Hou&s;e,</HI> Numb. 12. 7.</P>
<P>In this Chapter we have a divine Song which <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> by the Help of God's Spirit compo&s;ed for the U&s;e and Benefit of the People of God who were then upon the Stage, and tho&s;e that &s;hould ari&s;e after them; wherein he &s;etteth forth the Mercy of God to allure them, and his Vengeance to awaken them to obey all his Com|mandments, <HI>Ver.</HI> 1. <HI>to</HI> 45.</P>
<P>And having made an End of &s;peaking all the Words of this Song, (and almo&s;t all he had to &s;ay unto them in the Name of the Lord, for the Time of his Depar|ture was now at Hand.) He in <HI>Ver.</HI> 46. exhorted them,</P>
<P N="1">1. To &s;et their Hearts unto all the Words which he had te&s;tified among them. He had &s;hown them the Way of the Lord; the Religion they &s;hould choo&s;e, profe&s;s, practice and propagate in the World; and he would have them &s;et their Hearts to it. <HI>Set your Hearts unto all the Words which I te&s;tify among you this Day.</HI> Let the&s;e Words reach and affect your Hearts, and engage them to the Duties of Religion, &s;o that you may cheerfully and faithfully perform them.</P>

<P>And in this Ver&s;e of which my Text is a Part, he laboured to fa&s;ten the&s;e Words of Exhortation upon the People, with &s;uch Arguments as the&s;e; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P N="1">1. That which he had exhorted them unto was not a vain Thing for them to ob&s;erve; <HI>For it is not a vain Thing for you.</HI> They might be ready to think (as &s;ome do now) that Religion is a vain Thing; that there is no Profit in it, and that they might pro&s;per without it, as well as other Nations; but he would have them know and con&s;ider that it was no unprofitable Bu&s;ine&s;s, but of great Importance, and worthy of their mo&s;t &s;erious Care and Concern. For,</P>
<P N="2">2. It was their Life; <HI>becau&s;e it is your Life,</HI> i.e. it is as nece&s;&s;ary as your Life; as precious and profitable, and rather to be cho&s;en than your Life. <Q>O that Men were fully po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this, that Religion is their Life, even the Life of their Souls!</Q><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Henry in Loco.</HI></NOTE></P>

<P>Thus <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> the Man of God laboured to excite and &s;tir up the People of God to &s;tudy the Principles and perform the Duties of the holy Religion he had taught them, and to put their Children upon the&s;e Things.</P>
<P><HI>It is your Life.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="005173_0007_1016CFC1B91138F0">
From the Words I &s;hall ob&s;erve to you, this</P>
<P>DOCT. <HI>That Religion is the Life of God's People.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;peaking to this I &s;hall endeavour,
<LIST>
<ITEM>(1) To &s;hew you what Religion is in general.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(2) What that Religion is, which is the Life of God's People. And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>(3) Why it is called their Life.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I. I am to &s;how, <HI>What Religion is in general;</HI> or what we are to under&s;tand by it.</P>
<P>And here I &s;hall &s;ay,</P>
<P>The Word <HI>Religion</HI> is derived from the Latin Word <HI>Religo,</HI> which &s;ignifieth to fa&s;ten or bind hard, and it is u&s;ed for that Profe&s;&s;ion of Piety which a Man binds him&s;elf to ob&s;erve, in the Practice of which he hopeth and expecteth to be &s;aved. Salvation is that which all Men hope for who have any Sen&s;e of a future State of Weal and Wo; of Happine&s;s and Mi&s;ery; and every Man hopeth to be &s;aved in the Religion he profe&s;&s;eth. And therefore when a Man hath drank in any Religion, let it be never &s;o fal&s;e and vain, he is hardly brought off from it. Thus it was with the <HI>Athenians</HI> when the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> preach'd Chri&s;t and the Re&s;urrection unto them. <HI>Act.</HI> 17. <HI>Ver.</HI> 16, 17, &amp;c.</P>
<P>II. I am to &s;hew; <HI>What that Religion is, which is the Life of God's People.</HI></P>
<P>And here I &s;hall &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">1. It is not every Religion that is profe&s;&s;ed in the World, in the Practice of which Men hope to be &s;aved. And therefore mind; it is not the Religion of the <HI>Heathen</HI> or <HI>Pagan</HI> Nations; nor the Religion of the <HI>Mahomitans;</HI> neither is it the Religion of the <HI>Jews.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It is not the Religion of the Heathen or Pagan Nations</HI> Their Religion, (as the Rev. Dr. <HI>Beveridge</HI> ob&s;erves,

Religion of many People,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">As in <HI>Tartary, China,</HI> and <HI>India,</HI> and other Places.</NOTE> And in <HI>Affrica</HI> it is the mo&s;t prevailing Religion,<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Particularly in <HI>Egypt, Barbary, Bil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ulg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">red, Zaara,</HI> and the <HI>Negro</HI> Land &amp;c.</NOTE> So that next to the pagan Religion it is of the greate&s;t Extent.</P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P><HI>It is not the Religion which the Jews now profe&s;s.</HI> They were once the only Covenant People of God, and their Religion was the only true Religion in the World: The Principles of it are contained in the Book of the Law, called the old Te&s;tament; to which our Go&s;pel is annexed. And this Book they &s;ay, (and we concur with them in it) was written by holy Men of God, im|mediately in&s;pired by the Holy Gho&s;t, and therefore is not of human Invention, but of divine In&s;titution.</P>
<P>But in as much as they rejected the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> (our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t) who was prophe&s;ied of, and promi&s;ed to them in the Book of the Law, and who came to them according to Promi&s;e, and offered him|&s;elf to them to be their Saviour &amp; Redeemer, and would not accept of him, (<HI>Joh.</HI> 1. 11.) but by wicked Hands crucified and &s;lew him; (<HI>Acts</HI> 2. 23.) They are now broken off from God's Covenant, (<HI>Rom.</HI> 11. 20.) and re|jected from being a People &amp; Kingdom by them&s;elves, (tho' they were once a Nation and Kingdom of great Renown in the World) and are become a Proverb of Reproach, and a By-Word among all Nations whither they are driven; and their Religion is now become vain, and will not &s;ave them.</P>
<P>So that it is not every Religion which is profe&s;&s;ed in the World, in the Practice of which &s;ome hope to be &s;aved, that is the Life of the People of God.</P>
<P>Therefore I &s;hall &s;ay;&mdash;</P>
<P N="2">2. It is the true <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion,</HI> and that only which is the Life of God's People.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="005173_0010_1016CFCA5AA56558">
I &s;ay, <HI>the true Chri&s;tian Religion,</HI> becau&s;e all the Re|ligion that goeth under the Name of Chri&s;tian is not true; and all that call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians don't pro|fe&s;s the true Chri&s;tian Religion. Many gro&s;s Errors and Here&s;ies, and pernicious Principles and Opinions are broached &amp; taught by Men who call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians. The Church of <HI>Rome</HI> abounds with &s;uch; and among Prote&s;tants there are too many; therefore I &s;ay, <HI>it is the true Chri&s;tian Religion,</HI> and no other, which is the Life of God's People. The true Chri&s;tian Religion hath the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t for it's Author and Object; and therefore derives it's Name from him, and it is contained in the Scriptures of the old and new Te&s;ta|ment, called the holy Bible; wherein we are &s;hewn who Je&s;us Chri&s;t is, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>that he is the eternal and only begotten Son of God; the Brightne&s;s of his Father's Glory; and the expre&s;s Image of his Per&s;on, and only Saviour of the World:</HI> And wherein, we have the Hi&s;tory <HI>of his Birth and Education; of his Doctrine and Miracles; of his Sufferings and Death; of his Re&s;urrection from the Dead, and A&s;cention into Heaven;</HI> where he ever liveth to make Interce&s;&s;ion with God the Father on the Behalf of them that come unto God by him, <HI>Heb.</HI> 7. 25.</P>
<P>This Religion is the only &s;afe Religion; and that in the Practice of which Salvation is to be hoped for upon good and &s;ufficient Grounds; and it hath comparatively but few Vouchers; <HI>i. e.</HI> but few that profe&s;s it, and &s;tand firmly by it.</P>
<P>The Chri&s;tian Religion, if we con&s;ider it, in its large&s;t Latitude, (for that which is true, and that which is fal&s;e) &s;preads over but a &s;mall Part of the <HI>Globe.</HI> <Q>Some that have divided the inhabited World into thirty Parts, have found but five of the thirty to go under the Name of Chri&s;tian.</Q> And if all that call them|&s;elves Chri&s;tians, but yet don't profe&s;s the true Chri&s;tian Religion, were &s;et by them&s;elves, how few would be left?</P>
<P>And having &s;aid that the true Chri&s;tian Religion is the only Religion which is the Life of God's People;
<PB N="8" REF="005173_0011_1016CFCBE9C82EA8">
it may &s;eem proper that I give you &s;ome di&s;tingui&s;hing Marks and Characters of this Religion, (tho' all that might be &s;aid of it can't be now expected) whereby it may be di&s;cerned and known from that Religion which is not true Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>And here I &s;hall &s;ay&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. The true Chri&s;tian Religion teacheth us to own and acknowledge, the one only living and true God, the <HI>Father,</HI> the <HI>Son,</HI> and the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> to be the Object of religious Wor&s;hip, and no other. Not <HI>Baal,</HI> not an Idol, nor any graven Image. As God &s;aid to the Chil|dren of I&s;rael (his ancient Covenant People) &s;o he &s;aith to us, Exod. 20. 3, 4, 5. <HI>Thou &s;halt have no other Gods before me. Thou &s;halt not make unto thee any graven Image, or any Likene&s;s of any Thing that is in Heaven above, or that is in the Earth beneath, or that is in the Waters under the Earth: Thou &s;halt not bow down thy &s;elf to them, nor &s;erve them, for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God.</HI></P>
<P>The Heathen, who&s;e Religion is fal&s;e and vain, have many vain Objects of religious Wor&s;hip; their <HI>Idols are Silver &amp; Gold, the Works of Mens Hands,</HI> P&s;al. 135. 15. But the true Chri&s;tian Religion hath no other Object of religious Wor&s;hip than the one only living and true God; who is one in E&s;&s;ence, and three in Relations; the <HI>Father,</HI> the <HI>Son,</HI> and the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> Mat. 28. 19.</P>
<P>And as the true Chri&s;tian Religion hath the one only living and true God for the Object of religious Wor&s;hip, and no other, &s;o it teacheth Men to turn from their Idols which are Vanities, unto the living God, who made Hea|ven and Earth, and the Sea, and all Things that are therein, (<HI>Act.</HI> 14. <HI>v.</HI> 15.) and to wor&s;hip him, and him only with religious Wor&s;hip, <HI>Rev.</HI> 22. 8, 9.</P>
<P>When the Devil impudently tempted our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to deny the God that is above, and to fall down and wor&s;hip him, he rejected the Tempta|tion with the greate&s;t Abhorrence and Dete&s;tation, &s;aying as in Mat. 4. 10. <HI>Get thee hence Satan, for it is written,</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="005173_0012_1016CFCDDFD6DD18">
<HI>thou &s;halt wor&s;hip the Lord thy God, and him only &s;halt thou &s;erve:</HI> i. e. in a religious Manner, and with religious Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P N="2">2. The true Chri&s;tian Religion teacheth us to make the holy Word of God our Rule and Standard in all religious Affairs, and nothing el&s;e. Not the Laws of <HI>Heathens,</HI> not the Laws of <HI>Mahometans,</HI> nor the Laws of <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Men. And every true Chri&s;tian will look upon him&s;elf to be bound by it, for therein (and in no other Book) we are &s;hewn what is Good, and what it is that God requires of us; how he is to be feared, loved, and &s;erved by us; and all that we &s;hould know, believe, and do; that we may enjoy his Favour here, and be happy with him forever, is therein recorded and revealed to us, <HI>Micah</HI> 6. 8. <HI>Deut.</HI> 10. 12, 13. <HI>Heb.</HI> 13. 16.</P>
<P>There we are told that we mu&s;t repent of our Sins, and believe in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and do good Works,<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Acts 17. 30. 1 Joh. 3. 23.</NOTE> and that if we do the&s;e Things we &s;hall be &s;aved; but if we neglect them, we &s;hall be damned.<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Luk. 13. 3. Mar. 16. 16. and Rom. 2. 7, 8.</NOTE> We &s;hould therefore &s;earch the Scriptures, and adhere to them, <HI>Joh.</HI> 5. 39. <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 34. 16.</P>
<P>When our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;ent forth his Di&s;ciples to &s;pread and propagate the true Chri&s;tian Religion, he did not leave them to their Liberty to teach what they would, and to give what Laws they plea&s;ed to the Church, but he charged them to teach the People to ob&s;erve all tho&s;e Things which he had com|manded them, and nothing el&s;e, <HI>Mat.</HI> 28. 19, 20.</P>
<P>And when they &s;ub&s;tituted others in their Room, they charged them to keep to the Word, to preach that and nothing el&s;e, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 2. For when Men turn from that they run wild in Religion, and bring Di&s;order and Confu&s;ion into the Church.</P>
<P>The Word of God is pure and perfect, true and righ|teous altogether, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 19. 7, 8, 9. It is holy, ju&s;t, and

good, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7. 12. and therefore the more &s;ure Word of Prophecy, whereunto every one &s;hould take heed, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 19. It is more &s;ure than any Voice from Hea|ven, Vi&s;ion or Revelation, that any may pretend to; and if this be laid a&s;ide, we have no certain Rule for Religion, and mu&s;t needs walk in Darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>Men are mutable and fallable, &s;ubject to Change and to err: they are of one Mind to Day and another to-Morrow; and if Religion were to be under their Di|rection it would be as mutable and fallable as they, and change as they do; and there would be no certainty in it: therefore they are not fit to make Rules for the Re|ligion of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Under the Di&s;pen&s;ation of the Law many wicked Kings overthrew the true and pure Religion of God, and &s;ub&s;tituted a fal&s;e Religion in the room of it. And the Scribes and Phari&s;ees tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the Commandments of God by their own Traditions, on which Account our Saviour found Fault with them, and told them that their Wor&s;hip was vain, <HI>Mat.</HI> 15. 3, 6, 9. And &s;ince the Promulgation of the Go&s;pel, the true Chri&s;tian Religion hath been overthrown in many Places by the Command|ments of Men, and a fal&s;e Religion &s;ub&s;tituted in the Place of it; and it will be always &s;o if the Word of God be laid a&s;ide.</P>
<P N="3">3. The true Chri&s;tian Religion teacheth us to have re&s;pect to all God's Commandments and Ordinances; and will not allow us to be partial in the Law, nor to turn a&s;ide to the right Hand or to the left. Deut. 5. 32. 33. <HI>Ye &s;hall ob&s;erve to do as the Lord your God hath command|ed you; you &s;hall not turn a&s;ide to the right Hand or to the left. You &s;hall walk in all the Ways which the Lord your God hath commanded you &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The true Chri&s;tian Religion teacheth us to have a &s;pecial and &s;ingular Regard to the Glory of God in all our religious Duties &amp; moral Actions.

<P N="5">5. The true Chri&s;tian Religion teacheth us to make our humble &amp; fervent Addre&s;&s;es to the God &amp; Father of our Lord &amp; Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for the be&s;towment of his Holy Spirit upon us; (which he hath graciou&s;ly promi&s;ed, and for which he will be inquired of by us, to be&s;tow it on us, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36. 27, &amp; 37.) whereby we may be quick|ned out of our &s;piritual Death, regenerated and &s;anctified, and made fit to be Partakers of that Inheritance of the Saints in Light: and without which all our Pretences to the true Chri&s;tian Religion will prove empty &amp; vain.

<P N="6">6. The true Chri&s;tian Religion teacheth us not to rely on any Works of Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Piety which we do, for the Ju&s;tification of our Per&s;ons before God, and Salva|tion of our Souls; but to acknowledge when we have done all tho&s;e Things which are required of us, that we are unprofitable Servants, <HI>Luk.</HI> 17. 10.

1. The true Chri&s;tian Religion may be called the Life of God's People, <HI>becau&s;e it is their temporal Life;</HI> that is, the Way and Means to pre&s;erve and prolong it&punc; When <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> exhorted the People of God to &s;et their Hearts to all the Words which he te&s;tified among them, and ob&s;erve to do them, he told them that it was not a vain Thing for them, <HI>becau&s;e it was their Life;</HI> and then he added, <HI>Through this Thing ye &s;hall prolong your Days in the Land whither ye go over Jordan to po&s;&s;e&s;s it.</HI> By which he &s;hews us, that to be truly religious is a &s;ingu|lar Means to pre&s;erve and prolong our temporal Life in this World.

<P N="2">2. The true Chri&s;tian Religion may be called the Life of God's People, <HI>becau&s;e it is their political or civil Life;</HI> or their Life as a civil Government (whether Kingdom or Province) and they can't well, nor long &s;ub&s;i&s;t without it.

It went well with the Nation of the Jews &s;o long as they adhered to the true Religion, and they were famous and renowned in the Eyes of the Nations round about them: But when they declined, then they become con|temptible in the Eyes of other Nations, and were &s;orely puni&s;hed and broken by the ju&s;t Judgment of God upon them; as you may &s;ee in the Hi&s;tory of their Kingdom.</P>
<P N="3">3. The true Chri&s;tian Religion may be called the Life of God's People, <HI>becau&s;e it is their &s;piritual Life;</HI> or the Life of their precious and immortal Souls: without this their Souls are dead, even while their Bodies are alive, and will die eternally.</P>
<P>As the Body without the Spirit is dead, &s;o the Soul without true Religion is dead al&s;o; that is, &s;piritually dead; dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins; as the Apo&s;tle told the Ephe&s;ians they were before they embraced the true Chri&s;tian Religion, Eph. 2.1. <HI>You hath he quickned who were dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins:</HI> i. e.

<P N="4">4.

<P>Thus I have &s;hewn you, on what Account the true Chri&s;tian Religion, may be called the Life of God's People.</P>
<P>And now I &s;hall proceed to make &s;ome Improvement of this Doctrine in a few Words.</P>
<P>USE I. This Doctrine &s;hews us that &s;uch as make a Profe&s;&s;ion of Religion, &s;hould examine the Religion they profe&s;s, and &s;ee whether it be the true Chri&s;tian Religion.</P>
<P>There are many Religions in the World (as you have heard) and yet but one true Religion that will lead a Man to Heaven; &s;o that tho' &s;ome of all Nations &s;hall be &s;aved, yet not &s;ome of all Religions; and therefore every Man &s;hould examine his Religion, and not take it up upon Tru&s;t as &s;ome do, &s;aying they believe as the Church believes, and can give no other Account of their Religion.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> directs us to prove all Things, and to hold fa&s;t that which is good, 1 <HI>The&s;</HI> 5. 21. that is, to try all Doctrines and Opinions in Religion which are delivered by any for Truths. And we are not to be|lieve every Thing we hear 'till we have made trial of it. 1 Joh. 4. 1. <HI>Beloved, believe not every Spirit, but try the Spirits whether they be of God, becau&s;e many fal&s;e Prophets are gone out into the World.</HI></P>
<P>Q. What are we to try the Spirits by; or the Doc|trines which Men teach for Truths?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> By the Word of God, which is the Standard of Truth. Gal. 4. 30. <HI>What &s;aith the Scripture?</HI> I&s;ai. 8. 20, <HI>To the Law and to the Te&s;timony, if they &s;peak not accord|ing</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="005173_0018_1016CFDEA6ACECB8">
<HI>to this Word, it is becau&s;e they have no Light in them.</HI> The Word of God is a &s;ure Rule, a &s;afe Rule, and a &s;ufficient Rule, whereunto we do well that we take heed; (2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 19.) And to this every Man &s;hould bring his Creed, and try every Article of his Faith, and hold fa&s;t that which is good; for then is his Religion true when it agreeth with the Rule of Truth, which is the Word of God. The <HI>Bereans</HI> were commended for their Care to try the Apo&s;tles Doctrine by the Scriptures of Truth, <HI>Acts</HI> 17. 11.</P>
<P>USE. II. This Doctrine &s;hews us that the true Chri&s;tian Religion &s;hould be dear to us as our natural Life, yea, and more too, becau&s;e it is our &s;piritual Life, or the Life of our Souls, and the Way to eternal Life.</P>
<P>The Life of our Body is more precious to us than all our worldly Enjoyments: <HI>Skin for Skin; yea, all that a Man hath will he give for his Life,</HI> Job 3. 4. But the true Religion which is the Life of our Soul, &s;hould be more precious to us than the Life of our Body, and we &s;hould chu&s;e rather to part with our natural Life, than with our holy Religion, for if we lo&s;e this we lo&s;e our Souls.</P>
<P>Profane Hi&s;tory gives us many Examples of this Na|ture, and in the holy Word of God we read of many who cho&s;e to &s;uffer the Lo&s;s of their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, yea, and of their Lives to, rather than part with their holy Religion. <HI>Heb.</HI> 11. 35, 36, 37.</P>
<P>The Di&s;ciples of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t for&s;ook all they had for him, <HI>Mat.</HI> 19. 27. And <HI>Ste|phen,</HI> a Man full of Faith &amp; of the Holy Gho&s;t &s;uffered Death for his Sake, <HI>Acts</HI> 7. 59. And the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> willingly &s;uffered the Lo&s;s of all Things, rather than he would for&s;ake Chri&s;t, <HI>Phil.</HI> 3. 8. And if we would be his Di&s;ciples, we mu&s;t when he calls us to it for&s;ake all to follow him, <HI>Luk.</HI> 14. 33.</P>
<P>There is no worldly Thing that we &s;hould be &s;o much concerned for as the Religion of Chri&s;t. Tho' there are &s;ome, who (<HI>Gallio</HI> like) care not for the Religion of
<PB N="16" REF="005173_0019_1016CFE2A6E250B0">
Chri&s;t, and others who &s;peak and write again&s;t it, and per&s;ecute the Profe&s;&s;ors of it, and do all that they can to beat it down and de&s;troy it; yet it &s;hould be dearer to us than our Lives&punc; And above all Things we &s;hould be concerned to promote and pre&s;erve it in the World, and to hand it down to Po&s;terity, that the Generations to come may profe&s;s and practice it, and have the Bene|fit and Comfort of it.</P>
<P>USE III. This Doctrine &s;hews us the Vanity and Madne&s;s of &s;uch as &s;light and de&s;pi&s;e, and &s;et Light by the true Chri&s;tian Religion, and go about to e&s;tabli&s;h a Religion of their own Invention.</P>
<P>This is the Way and Manner of &s;ome Men; they don't &s;ee thro' the Religion which God hath in&s;tituted and revealed in his Word, therefore they de&s;pi&s;e it, and &s;et up a Religion of their own Invention, and will not &s;ubmit to any other than that which is the Product of their own (depraved) Rea&s;on and Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>God never de&s;igned humane Rea&s;on to be the Rule of his Religion, but his own Word &amp; Law; and that Man that hath no other Rule for his Religion than his own natural Rea&s;on and Under&s;tanding, is no better of it than the Heathen, and &s;tands no fairer for Heaven than they do.</P>
<P>Humane Rea&s;on is good in its Place, and when under proper Regulation u&s;eful in Religion; but it can never contrive a Religion that will lead a Man to Heaven.</P>
<P>Who will not acknowledge that <HI>Adam,</HI> when he had fallen from God's Favour and Fellow&s;hip, had as much humane Rea&s;on as any of his Po&s;terity? And did he know how to re&s;tore him&s;elf into his Favour and Fel|low&s;hip again? No verily; he had no Notion of this: therefore in&s;tead of contriving a Religion to &s;ave him|&s;elf by&punc; he endeavoured to hide him&s;elf from the Pre|&s;ence of the Lord among the Trees of the Garden; <HI>Gen.</HI> 3. 8. And they act as ignorantly who think to contrive a Religion of their own whereby they may be &s;aved; and &s;et Light by the Religion which God hath revealed;
<PB N="17" REF="005173_0020_1016CFE86FBB9EA8">
in the Belief and Practice of which alone we may on good Ground expect Salvation.</P>
<P>USE IV. This Doctrine &s;hould put us upon a &s;erious Reflection on the State of our holy Religion at this Day; and excite us to con&s;ider whether it be in a reviving or dying Condition.</P>
<P>That there hath been a few Years pa&s;t, a remarkable Revival of the true Chri&s;tian Religion in &s;ome Towns in this Country, is very evident &amp; manife&s;t to the Teachers of it, and many others: and it well becometh us to give God the Prai&s;e and Glory of his Grace in reviving his Work as he hath done in one Place and another.</P>
<P>And while we are thankful for this, we have Cau&s;e to lament before him that there are &s;uch different Opi|nions with re&s;pect to the State of Religion, both among Mini&s;ters and People.</P>
<P>Some call it a Time of great Reformation at this Day; others; a Time of great Delu&s;ion and Giddine&s;s; and little Reformation.</P>
<P>Some rejoyce that the Work of God is carried on gloriou&s;ly: others tremble, fearing le&s;t Satan be let loo&s;e, and &s;uffered to delude many, both Mini&s;ters and People.</P>
<P>Some &s;ay that the itenerant Preachers, who have been travelling into many Towns in the Country of late, have been the happy In&s;truments of rou&s;ing many out of their carnal Security and of reforming their Lives. <HI>Others</HI> &s;ay they are wandering Stars, and that &s;ome of them impart no Light; that their travelling from Place to Place hath been the Occa&s;ion of much Confu&s;ion and Di&s;order in the Wor&s;hip of God, and &s;uch Cen&s;oriou&s;|ne&s;s in &s;ome Places, as is incon&s;i&s;tent with the true Chri&s;tian Religion; and by Means of them &s;ome Chur|ches, where there was Peace and Holine&s;s flouri&s;hing, have been &s;orely rent and broken with Divi&s;ions.</P>
<P>Some &s;ay that illiterate Men (&s;uch it may be, as never learnt the A&s;&s;embly's Catechi&s;m, nor can give any tol|lerable Account of the Doctrine of our Ju&s;tification be|fore

God, which is as <HI>Luther</HI> well ob&s;erves, <HI>Articulas &s;tantis vel cadentis Eccle&s;iae,</HI>) who pretend to an imme|diate, and inward Call from the Spirit of God to ex|hort others, and to invite them to come unto Chri&s;t; have the Power of God, and that the Holy Spirit works by them for the Conviction, Conver&s;ion, and Comfort of many.</P>
<P><HI>Others</HI> &s;ay that &s;uch Men are unqualified &amp; uncalled, and undertake this Work out of the Pride of their own Hearts, and to gratify their own Lu&s;t.&mdash;That the Mini|&s;try of the Word is a &s;acred Office, not to be invaded by private Men, whether learned or unlearned, under the Pretence of an inward and immediate Call to it: That none are to meddle in it, but &s;uch as are qualified for it, and externally and regularly called to it<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Heb. 5. 4. Rom. 10. 15.</NOTE>; That the&s;e Men run before they are &s;ent, as the fal&s;e Prophets did of old;<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Jer. 23. 21.</NOTE> And as the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> tells us, &s;ome &s;hall do in Go&s;pel Times;<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. 2. 1.</NOTE> And by Means of &s;uch Men the &s;acred Scriptures are mo&s;t injuriou&s;ly wre&s;ted, the Peace and Order of the Churches di&s;turbed; and a great many Errors and Mi&s;takes introduced. Satan hath filled the Church and World with Errors &amp; Trou|bles this Way; &s;aith an excellent Divine, namely Mr. <HI>Flavel.</HI> Again,</P>
<P>Some have a fond Regard to Voices, Vi&s;ions, and Revelations, and countenance and encourage them, as if the Mind and Will of God were to be known by them&punc; There were &s;ome &s;uch in the beginning of the Reformation by <HI>Luther</HI> and <HI>Calvin,</HI> and the&s;e Men <Q>were &s;o intangled with certain enthu&s;ia&s;tical Snares, that they thought it the highe&s;t Impiety to renounce them.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Others</HI> have no Regard at all to Voices, Vi&s;ions and Revelations, and &s;hew them no Countenance; but &s;ay, that God who at &s;undry Times, and in divers Manners,
<PB N="19" REF="005173_0022_1016CFED51EB4F90">
&s;pake in Times pa&s;t unto the Fathers by the Prophets, hath in the&s;e la&s;t Days &s;poken to us by his Son, (<HI>Heb.</HI> 1. 1, 2.) whom we &s;hould hear, (<HI>Mat.</HI> 17. 5) and that we are to look for no Revelations but what he hath made to us in his Word: <HI>Indeed we need no more.</HI> As for Voices, Vi&s;ions, Revelations, and Impul&s;es, many have been deceived by them; but as for what Chri&s;t has revealed it deceiveth none; but is &s;ufficient to make Men wi&s;e unto Salvation thro' Faith which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. 15.</P>
<P><HI>Luther</HI> upon Occa&s;ion &s;aid, the Scripture is &s;o full that as for Vi&s;ions and Revelations <HI>nec curo, nec de&s;idero,</HI> I neither regard nor de&s;ire them. And when he him|&s;elf had a Vi&s;ion of Chri&s;t, (after a Day of Fa&s;ting and Prayer) he cried out, <HI>Avoid Satan,</HI> I know no Image of Chri&s;t but the Scriptures. Again,</P>
<P>Some &s;ay that Exclamations and Faintings on the Account of extraordinary Sorrow for Sin, or Joy in the Holy Gho&s;t, in publick A&s;&s;emblies, or more private Meeting for the Wor&s;hip of God, is a Sign of the gra|cious Pre&s;ence of God, and of the Effu&s;ion of his Holy Spirit upon them.</P>
<P><HI>Others</HI> &s;ay it is Breach of that Order and Decency which the Spirit of God hath directed us to ob&s;erve in our religious A&s;&s;emblies for his Wor&s;hip, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14. 40.</P>
<P>Some &s;ay that Divi&s;ions and Seperations in the Chur|ches, have a great Tendency to promote true Religion in them at this Day.</P>
<P><HI>Others</HI> &s;ay, that we have no &s;uch Direction in the holy Scriptures; and that it is a Sign of the dying State of Religion; that the Scriptures caution Chri&s;tian Chur|ches again&s;t Divi&s;ions &amp; Seperations among them&s;elves; and exhort them all to &s;peak the &s;ame Thing, and to be perfectly joined together in the &s;ame Mind, and in the &s;ame Judgment; and to endeavour to keep the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1. 10. and <HI>Eph.</HI> 4. 3.</P>

<P>And we &s;hould e&s;teem it &s;o, there, <HI>where</HI> the Word of God is more remarkably quick and powerful in the publick Mini&s;try of it than u&s;ual in our publick A&s;&s;em|blies; <HI>where</HI> there is a wonderful &s;haking among the dry Bones, and many that have been for a long Time dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins, appear to be made alive to God; <HI>where</HI> &s;leepy Sinners are awakened; &s;tubborn Sinners &s;ubdued; proud Sinners humbled; carnal Wretches made &s;piritual; covetous Worldlings made liberal; Drunkards made temperate; and unclean Per|&s;ons made cha&s;te: <HI>Where</HI> profane Swearers, by the dread|ful Name of God, now fear his glorious &amp; fearful Name: <HI>Where</HI> tho&s;e that lived unmindful of Heaven, now &s;eek the Things which are above, and &s;et their Affections upon them: <HI>Where</HI> tho&s;e that lived prayerle&s;s Lives, now call upon God; and tho&s;e that de&s;pi&s;ed his Word now trem|ble at it: <HI>Where</HI> many that had no Sight nor Sen&s;e of their Sins, and of the wretched and mi&s;erable State they are in by Nature, are now pricked in their Heart, and cry out &s;aying, <HI>What mu&s;t we do to be &s;aved? Where,</HI> many that turned their Backs upon the Table of the Lord, and &s;aid (practically at lea&s;t) the Table of the Lord is contemptible, do now hunger &amp; thir&s;t for Com|munion with Chri&s;t there; and <HI>where,</HI> Additions are made to the Church daily; and true Chri&s;tian Charity, Peace, and Unity, with Holine&s;s, doth flouri&s;h; there
<PB N="21" REF="005173_0024_1016CF9F892B7920">
Religion is reviving; and that it is &s;o in &s;ome Places, is to be acknowledged to the Prai&s;e and Glory of God.</P>
<P>But alas, how is it in &s;ome other Places? It is to be &s;poken with Lamentation, that Religion is in a lan|gui&s;hing and dying Condition, and reduced to a low Ebb, in &s;ome Places. It is &s;o in &s;uch Places, <HI>where</HI> the Peo|ple are &s;ettled on their Lees, are at Ea&s;e in Zion, and unconcerned for the Salvation of their Souls; <HI>where</HI> they that have been filthy are filthy &s;till; that have been unju&s;t are unju&s;t &s;till; they that have been prayerle&s;s, are prayerle&s;s &s;till; and they that have lived in the Neglect of the holy Duties of Religion, and in the Practice of &s;candalous Immoralities, are unhum|bled and unreformed to this Day: <HI>where</HI> there are none that &s;tir up them&s;elves to take hold on God, and the Ways of <HI>Zion</HI> mourn, becau&s;e none cometh to the &s;olemn Fea&s;ts; and <HI>where</HI> there are &s;uch lamentable Seperati|ons, Confu&s;ions, and Cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s, as plainly &s;hew that God is departing from them: In &s;uch Places, Religion is in a dying Condition. And is not this the Ca&s;e in &s;ome of our Towns?</P>
<P>USE V. This Doctrine &s;hould excite and &s;tir up all &s;uch as make a Profe&s;&s;ion of the true Chri&s;tian Religion, to take heed and beware le&s;t Satan deceive them, and &s;o at la&s;t they &s;hould prove counterfeit Chri&s;tians. 2 Cor. 2. 11. <HI>Le&s;t Satan &s;hould get an Advantage of us.</HI></P>
<P>There is Danger of this, and every one &s;hould be jealous of him&s;elf, and fear le&s;t he &s;hould be deceived. The Phari&s;ee was deceived, (<HI>Luk.</HI> 18. 11.) and the Lao|diceans were deceived, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3. 17. And it is common for Men to be deceived with re&s;pect to the State and Condition of their Souls.</P>
<P>Some that pretend much to Religion, and the Spirit of God, do many Times give &s;ufficient Rea&s;on to fear a counterfeit Work: And indeed it is no wonder if many &s;hould prove counterfeit Chri&s;tians, and reprobate Silver, in &s;uch a Time as this, when Religion is &s;o much talked of, and profe&s;&s;ed in one Place and another.</P>

<P>Satan who transforms him&s;elf into an Angel of Light, (2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. 14.) is doubtle&s;s now at Work, and u&s;eth his helli&s;h Policy to counterfeit the Works of God's Spirit in many, and how near he may mimick them is hard to determine: He may do much this Way to the Delu&s;ion of many Souls, if God permits him.</P>
<P>We may not think the Time is now come wherein he is bound, and &s;hall hurt no more; or that he now &s;leepeth, when his Kingdom &s;haketh in many Places, and &s;eems to be coming down apace; but we &s;hould fear le&s;t he get an Advantage of us, and pray earne&s;tly that he may be brui&s;ed under our Feet; and lament tho&s;e Things which have a Shew of his Foot, and give us Rea&s;on to fear that he is &s;uffered to delude &s;ome un|wary Per&s;ons to the everla&s;ting Ruin of their precious Souls.</P>

<P>There is much to be done for it, and &s;omething may be done by every one that maketh a Profe&s;&s;ion of it. Therefore I &s;hall addre&s;s Per&s;ons of every Order and Degree, to put forth their helping Hand for the Pro|motion of our holy Religion. And here,</P>
<P>I. Let me addre&s;s <HI>civil Magi&s;trates;</HI> or &s;uch as God hath promoted to the Seats of civil Government, to do what they can to promote the Religion of Chri&s;t.</P>

<HI>Honoured Patriots!</HI> Let it not &s;eem a &s;mall Thing to you, that you have the true Chri&s;tian Religion to pro|tect and defend, but e&s;teem it as a very great Honour conferred upon you, and Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in you by him, <HI>by whom Kings reign, and Princes decree Ju&s;tice; by whom Princes rule, and Nobles, even all the Judges of the Earth,</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Prov. 8. 15, 16.</NOTE> and labour to approve your &s;elves faithful to him, and to his Religion.</P>
<P>Th&ocirc; the Religion of Chri&s;t may &s;ub&s;i&s;t without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of civil Magi&s;trates, (as it hath done, yea, and even then when civil Magi&s;trates oppo&s;ed it, and laboured to beat it down and de&s;troy it,) yet &s;uch Men have been very helpful to promote it. And as they have Power and Authority, &s;o they &s;hould improve it for that End.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal Ways in and by which civil Ma|gi&s;trates may very much promote the Religion of Chri&s;t. Give me leave to mention a few.</P>
<P>They may do it&mdash;</P>
<P>By their earne&s;t and fervent Prayers to almighty God, thr&ocirc; Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for the Pre&s;ervation of it, in its Life, Power, and Purity.</P>
<P>By their holy and religious Examples; and wi&s;e Coun|&s;els in &s;uch difficult and perplexing Ca&s;es as the Mini|&s;ters of it may be concerned in, and a&s;k their Coun&s;el about. And</P>
<P>By enacting and executing &s;uch Laws as have a ten|dency thereunto. Thus they may promote the Religion of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath clothed them with Power to <HI>enact</HI> and <HI>execute</HI> Laws for the Pre&s;erva|tion of his Religion. Here mind&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Civil Magi&s;trates may enact Laws for the promo|ting and pre&s;erving the true Chri&s;tian Religion.</HI></P>

They may not make Laws again&s;t it, to beat it down and de&s;troy it, for they have received no &s;uch Power from Chri&s;t, by whom they rule and govern Men: They as well as others are under that Tie, 2 Cor. 13. 8. <HI>We can do nothing again&s;t the Truth, but for the Truth.</HI> They may not hinder the free Cour&s;e of Religion, nor make Laws for the Rule of it; for this, Chri&s;t who is the Head of the Church, and Author of Religion, hath done already, and exhibited them in his Word.</P>
<P>But they may add a civil Sanction and Strength of Law, for the &s;trengthning and aiding the Exerci&s;e of Religion, and &s;ecuring tho&s;e divine Rights and Privi|ledges which Chri&s;t hath given to his Church, and to oblige Men to &s;ubmit to the Laws of Chri&s;t, &s;o far at lea&s;t as to make no Di&s;turbance in the Church, and by doing &s;o they may promote the Religion of Chri&s;t.</P>

<Q><P>To Kings, Princes, Rulers and Magi&s;trates, we affirm that principally and chiefly the Purgation and Con&s;ervation of Religion appertains, &s;o that not only they are appointed for civil Policy, but al&s;o for Main|tenance of the true Religion, and for the Suppre&s;&s;ion of all Super&s;tition what&s;oever.

<P><HI>Calvin, Zanchius,</HI> and <HI>Polanus,</HI> hold that the Chri&s;tian Magi&s;trate, his Office as concerning Religion, is dili|gently to take Care that in his Dominion or Kingdom, Religion from the pure Word of God, expounded by the Word of God it&s;elf, and under&s;tood according to the Principles of Faith, (which others call the analogy of Faith) be either in&s;tituted, or (being in|&s;tituted) kept pure; or being corrupted, be re&s;tored, and reformed: That fal&s;e Doctrines, Abu&s;es, Idols, and Super&s;titions be taken away, to the Glory of God, and to his own and his Subjects Salvation.<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gille&s;pie</HI>'s Aaron's Rod. p. 259.</NOTE></P></Q>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Civil Magi&s;trates may execute &s;uch Laws as have a Tendency to promote and pre&s;erve the Religion of Chri&s;t among the People of God; and inflict tho&s;e Puni&s;hments on Offenders which the Law appoints.</HI> For they are by the Appointment of God to execute Wrath upon them that do Evil. Rom. 13. 4. <HI>He is the Mini&s;ter of God, a Revenger,</HI> (or Officer) <HI>to execute Wrath,</HI> (or Puni&s;hment) <HI>upon him that doth Evil.</HI></P>
<P>The civil Magi&s;trate is <HI>Cu&s;tos et vindex utriu&s;&abque; Tabulae,</HI> and ought to pre&s;erve the fir&s;t &amp; &s;econd Table of God's

<P>There is, (doubtle&s;s) a good Work of God going on in the Country, his Spirit is evidently poured out upon many in one Place and another, which calls for our mo&s;t grateful and thankful Acknowledgement unto him.</P>

<P>And let us go on in the Way of our Duty in full A&s;&s;urance of Faith, having our Hearts &s;prinkled from an evil Con&s;cience, and our Bodies wa&s;hed with pure Water, (<HI>Heb.</HI> 10.22.) And while a Spirit of Giddine&s;s po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth the Minds of &s;ome, &s;o that they are to&s;&s;ed to and fro, and carried about with every Wind of Doctrine by the Slight of Men, and cunning Craftine&s;s whereby they lie in wait to deceive, (<HI>Eph.</HI> 4. 14.) Let us be &s;tedfa&s;t unmoveable, always abounding in the Work of the Lord, for as much as we know that our Labour is not in vain in the Lord, (1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15. 55.) And holding fa&s;t the Profe&s;&s;ion of our Faith, without wavering, let us con&s;ider one another, to provoke unto Love and good Works, (<HI>Heb.</HI> 10. 23, 24.) And then Religion may flou|ri&s;h and pro&s;per in our Churches.</P>
<P>III. Let me addre&s;s the Reverend and Learned Pre|&s;ident of our College, and Profe&s;&s;or of Divinity, and the worthy Tutors, who are a&s;&s;i&s;ting in the Government and In&s;truction of the Students there.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Learned Gentlemen!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The College, we tru&s;t, is a Nur&s;ery of Religion and Piety, as well as of good humane Literature; and to you is committed the Care of our Sons, not only for their In&s;truction in the liberal Arts and Sciences, but al&s;o in the Principles of the true Chri&s;tian Religion; and it is expected that while they are under your Care and In&s;truction, there be a good Foundation laid, by building upon which they may be u&s;eful In&s;truments in their Generation of promoting and pre&s;erving the Life of our holy Religion: And by doing what you can for this End, you may be greatly profitable to the Religion of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Our College hath been very much the Glory of <HI>New-England</HI> for more than a Century of Years, and is &s;o at this Day; many eminent and excellent Men for Learn|ing, Wi&s;dom, Piety and Prudence, have &s;prang from thence; Men that have been of great U&s;e and Service both in the Church and State; &s;everal of our excellent <HI>Governours,</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Particularly, <HI>Stoughton, Dudley,</HI> and <HI>Belcher,</HI> in this Pro|vince; <HI>Salton&s;tall</HI> and <HI>Law</HI> in <HI>Connecticut;</HI> and <HI>Went|worth</HI> in <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire.</HI></NOTE> have been educated there; and many of our Magi&s;trates and Mini&s;ters; who in their Day and Generation were happy In&s;truments in the Hand of God of promoting the Religion of Chri&s;t in the&s;e Chur|ches, and among this People: And ble&s;&s;ed be God, our Eyes behold many &s;uch at this Day.</P>
<P>The Lord grant that the College may never become a Seminary for degenerate Plants, who will with their fooli&s;h Hands pull down tho&s;e Hou&s;es which their pious Fathers have been building for the Name of the Lord in this Wilderne&s;s; as the Reverend and Learned Dr. <HI>I. Mather</HI> (who for many Years pre&s;ided there to the great Comfort and Satisfaction of many under his Care) feared in his Day.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See his <HI>Ichabod.</HI> p. 75.</NOTE></P>

The Welfare and Pro&s;perity of the&s;e Churches, under God, doth very much depend upon the good Govern|ment &amp; Education of our Sons at the College: if they come forth well in&s;tructed, and e&s;tabli&s;hed in the true Chri&s;tian Religion, they may be happy In&s;truments of promoting it in their Day and Generation; but if they come forth poi&s;oned with corrupt Principles, they'l be likely to poi&s;on and ruin the&s;e Churches.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now pa&s;s to the la&s;t Addre&s;s which I have to offer on the Behalf of our holy Religion.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>IV. Let me addre&s;s all Gentlemen, and Per&s;ons in a private Capacity; and particularly Heads of Families who make a Profe&s;&s;ion of the true Chri&s;tian Religion, to do what they can to promote and pre&s;erve the Life of it.</P>
<P><HI>Men and Brethren,</HI> You may do much for Religion in the Places God hath &s;et you in: And indeed, all that <HI>Magi&s;trates</HI> and <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> can do, will not avail much, unle&s;s you put to your helping Hand.</P>
<P>Religion will mo&s;t certainly die from among us, un|le&s;s Heads of Families keep it alive in their Hou&s;es: <HI>Well then,</HI> &s;tir up your &s;elves, you who are Heads of Families to this your Duty and Intere&s;t. And to this End:</P>
<P>Set up and keep up the Wor&s;hip of God in your Families; and make your Hou&s;es, Hou&s;es of Prayer, and re&s;olve with <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> that as for you and your Hou&s;es you will &s;erve the Lord, <HI>Jo&s;h.</HI> 24. 15. When Heads of Families ca&s;t off Fear, and re&s;train Prayer before God, and have no Hearts to ble&s;s their Hou&s;es in the Name of the Lord, they are no true Friends to Religi|on; and tho' they may not be open and profe&s;&s;ed Enemies to it, yet by bringing up Children and Ser|vants in the Neglect of this Duty, they are bringing up a Generation that will, unle&s;s &s;overeign Grace prevent, bid Defiance to Religion. Again,</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="005173_0037_1016CF8E87C136D8">
In&s;truct your Children and Servants in the Principles and Duties of Religion; teach them the good Know|ledge of God, and of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and charge them to keep the Way of the Lord; thus did <HI>Abraham, (Gen.</HI> 18. ver. 19.) and <HI>David,</HI> (1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 28. 9.) and &s;o &s;hould you. <HI>Deut.</HI> 6. 6, 7. <HI>Prov.</HI> 27. 6. <HI>Eph.</HI> 6. 4. and 9. Again,</P>
<P>Set good Examples before your Children and Ser|vants, Examples of Sobriety, Temperance, Meekne&s;s, Patience, Humility, Ju&s;tice, Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Charity, Faith, and Purity of Life; that you may be able to &s;ay to them, with a good Con&s;cience, as <HI>Gideon</HI> &s;aid to his Soldiers, <HI>Look on me and do likewi&s;e,</HI> Judg. 7. 17.</P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P>Have a watchful Eye over them, and labour to re|&s;train and keep them back from bad Company and Cour&s;es, as much as you can. <HI>Eli</HI>'s Neglect to re&s;train his Sons from their wicked Practices, was a great Hurt to Religion, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 2. 17. and at length prov'd the Ruin of his Hou&s;e. See 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 3. 13, 14.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things Heads of Families &s;hould do to pre|&s;erve and promote the Life of our holy Religion.</P>
<P>And we &s;hould all, as we have Opportunity and Ability, freely, cheerfully, and abundantly contribute of our Sub&s;tance for the promoting and pre&s;erving the Religion of Chri&s;t, not only in the Places where we live, but al&s;o in other Places, where we know our Help is wanted.</P>
<P>It was the Cu&s;tom and Practice of the primitive Chri&s;tians to do what they could to promote the true Chri&s;tian Religion in one Place and another by their publick Contributions; the Churches of <HI>Macedonia</HI> and <HI>Achaia</HI> contributed freely and abundantly for that End. <HI>Rom.</HI> 15. 26. and 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 8. 1, 2, 3, 4.</P>
<P>And we have &s;ome modern Examples of this Nature; many of our Chri&s;tian Brethren and Friends in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> have contributed abundantly for the Propaga|tion of our holy Religion in remote Places, where the
<PB N="35" REF="005173_0038_1016CF916E6C1438">
People have been either not able, or not willing to promote it, among them&s;elves:&mdash;And there are many in this Country and Province that have fared the better for their Chri&s;tian Liberality. And their Zeal &s;hould provoke us to the like Works of Piety towards God, and Charity towards the Souls of Men. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9. 2.</P>
<P>And who indeed that hath experienced the Power and Efficacy of God's Word upon his own Heart for his Illumination, Conviction, Conver&s;ion and Comfort, will not endeavour, this Way, when 'tis in the Power of his Hand, that others may experience the &s;ame?</P>
<P>I &s;hould think it a &s;ad Epitaph &s;hould this be wrote upon my Grave, &s;aid a certain Per&s;on. <Q>Here lies a Man that would not &s;erve his Generation by propa|gating as much Acquaintance with Religion to Po&s;|terity as he could. <HI>Or,</HI> Here lies a Man that had a Life of many Years in the World, but he went thr&ocirc; it, and yet no Man knew God the better for him, and no one got more Acquaintance with God thr&ocirc; his Means.</Q></P>
<P>We are not made for our &s;elves alone, but we are made to help in making the World better; and if the Age we live in is not the better for us, it will be the wor&s;e.</P>
<P>Our E&s;tates, if ju&s;tly gotten, come of God, he is the Owner of them, more &s;o than we are, and when we be&s;tow any Thing for the Propagation of Religion, we may &s;ay as King <HI>David</HI> did, when <HI>he,</HI> and his <HI>Princes,</HI> and <HI>People</HI> offered willingly and abundantly for the Service of the Hou&s;e of God; <HI>All Things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee,</HI> 1 Chron. 29. 14. And when we thus give to the Lord we honour him with our Sub&s;tance, and take the mo&s;t proper Way to increa&s;e what we have. See <HI>Prov.</HI> 3. 9. 10. and Chap. 11. 25.</P>
<P>Thus I have with great Plaine&s;s appeared as an Ad|vocate for that Religion which is our Life.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="005173_0039_1016CF94D71685C0">
And now I &s;hall conclude with three Arguments to excite us all to do what we can in the Places &amp; Stations God hath &s;et us in, to pre&s;erve and promote the Life of our holy Religion. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Con.</HI> That the only true Religion hath been lo&s;t from many Places and People that once enjoy'd it, thr&ocirc; their Neglect of it.</P>
<P>God hath always pre&s;erved the true Religion in the World, and he will not &s;uffer the Gates of Hell, &s;o to prevail again&s;t it, as to de&s;troy it out of the World &s;o long as Time &s;hall endure, <HI>Mat.</HI> 16. 18. But yet it hath not been always pre&s;erved in one Place, &amp; among one People, but it hath been moving from Place to Place; and from one Family, Nation, and Kingdom, to another.</P>
<P>God fir&s;t gave Life to the true Religion in <HI>Adam</HI>'s Family; then in <HI>Noah</HI>'s; then in <HI>Abraham</HI>'s; and then in <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s; then in <HI>Jacob</HI>'s; and then in the Nation of the Jews; and then among the Gentiles.</P>
<P>No People have had it among them from the begin|ning of the World to this Day; but it hath been mov|ing, and lo&s;t from many Places and People, as is evi|dent from Hi&s;tory both &s;acred and profane.</P>
<P><HI>It hath been lo&s;t from the Nation of the Jews for many hundred Years pa&s;t.</HI> If we look into the holy Scriptures of the old and new Te&s;tament, we may there find that the Jews had once the only true Religion in the World; but now it is lo&s;t from them. Our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t threatned them with the Lo&s;s of it, when he &s;aid as in Mat. 21. 43. <HI>The Kingdom of God &s;hall be taken from you, and given to a Nation bringing forth the Fruits thereof.</HI> And as he threatned &s;o it came to pa&s;s, and they have now no true Religion among them: Thr&ocirc; Unbelief they were broken off from God's Covenant, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11. 20. and being broken off God hath &s;aid to them, <HI>Loammi,</HI> i. e. <HI>Ye are not my People, and I will not be your God;</HI> as in <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 1. 9. Again,</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="005173_0040_1016CF98A3C02D08">
<HI>It hath been lo&s;t from many Places of the Gentiles.</HI> When the Jews were broken off from God's Covenant, then the believing Gentiles were graffed in, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11. 11. and the true Religion was with them; and hath been pre&s;erved among them unto this Day; but it hath not continued in any one Place from that Time to this; <HI>no;</HI> but it hath been moving from Place to Place.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Places in which it flouri&s;hed in the Days of the Apo&s;tles of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, are now de&s;titute of it: The &s;even Churches which were in the mo&s;t famous Cities of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>Ephe&s;us, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thiatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, &amp; Laodicea,</HI> of which we read, <HI>Rev.</HI> 1. 11. in which our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t walked, are all now ex|tinct; and the People that dwell there walk in Darkne&s;s; in the Darkne&s;s of Ignorance, Super&s;tition, &amp; Here&s;y; and in &s;ome Places they have quite lo&s;t the Chri&s;tian Name.</P>
<P>And as the true Chri&s;tian Religion hath long &s;ince been lo&s;t from <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> &s;o it hath al&s;o from <HI>Affrica,</HI> where there were once &s;ome Thou&s;ands of Chri&s;tian Churches, and many famous Mini&s;ters; as <HI>Tertullian, Cyprian</HI> and <HI>Au&s;tin;</HI> who&s;e Writings are &s;till in U&s;e in the Chri&s;tian Church.</P>
<P>And as the true Chri&s;tian Religion hath been lo&s;t out of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Affrica,</HI> &s;o it is in a great Mea&s;ure lo&s;t out of <HI>Europe.</HI> In <HI>Bavaria,</HI> in <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> in <HI>Moravia,</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Tran&s;ilvania,</HI> there have been famous Chri&s;tian Churches, but now they are corrupted with Popery, and Sociniani&s;m. As the learned and excellent Dr. <HI>Increa&s;e Mather</HI> ob&s;erves.<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">See his <HI>Ichabod.</HI> p. 61, 62.</NOTE></P>
<P>There was once in <HI>Rome</HI> the true Chri&s;tian Religion; a holy Church, a People beloved of God, called to be Saints, who&s;e Faith was &s;poken of throughout the whole World, as we read, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1. 7.

2. <HI>Con.</HI> That the true Chri&s;tian Religion may be lo&s;t from the People of God in this Land, and will be &s;o, if there be no Care taken to pre&s;erve it.</P>
<P>It is now &s;omething more than &s;ix Score Years &s;ince the true Chri&s;tian Religion was brought into this Land, (which was then a Wilderne&s;s) by our pious Ance&s;tors; and through the wonderful Patience and Goodne&s;s of God it is now handed down to the third and fourth Ge|neration; but we don't know that it &s;hall be continued for Generations to come; <HI>Gray Hairs are here and there upon it;</HI> many Symptoms of its langui&s;hing and dying State and Condition may be &s;een by every one that hath any Skill in Religion.</P>
<P>Are not the Divi&s;ions and groundle&s;s Seperations which are in many of our Churches in this Land, evi|dent Tokens of the &s;ickly State of Religion?</P>
<P>And doth not the &s;pringing up, and prevailing of Doctrines contrary to the true Chri&s;tian Religion in one Place and another, threaten the Death of our holy Religion, particularly <HI>Dei&s;m, Ariani&s;m, Arminiani&s;m</HI> and <HI>Antinomiani&s;m?</HI> Th&ocirc; the three former do not appear &s;o bare-faced among us as the latter, yet they have too many Vouchers in &s;ome Places where the true Religion is profe&s;&s;ed. As for the Antinomian Here&s;ies, they &s;eem to be &s;preading apace, and it is high Time to guard again&s;t them, le&s;t the&s;e Churches &s;hould be infe&s;ted and &s;orely di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with their Errors, as they were in their early Days. A &s;hort Account of which the Reverend and Learned Dr. <HI>Cotton Mather</HI> hath given us in his <HI>Magnalia,</HI> which is worthy of our Ob&s;ervation at this Day.<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><Q><P>Book 7th. p. 14, 15, 16. The Church of God had not long been in this <HI>Wilderne&s;s</HI> before the <HI>Dragon</HI> ca&s;t forth &s;everal <HI>Floods</HI> to devour it; but not the lea&s;t of tho&s;e <HI>Floods</HI> was one of <HI>Antinomian</HI> and <HI>Famili&s;tical</HI> Here&s;ies, with which the Country began betimes to be infe&s;ted.&mdash;And the Stir which they made about tho&s;e <HI>Opinions,</HI> grew &s;o general that they quickly affected all the publick Affairs of the Country.&mdash;</P>
<P>There did then ari&s;e in the Land a Di&s;tinction between &s;uch as were under a <HI>Covenant of Works,</HI> and &s;uch as were under a <HI>Covenant of Grace;</HI> wherein the bigger Part of the Country in the Management of that Inquiry; <HI>By what Evidence mu&s;t a Man proceed in taking to him&s;elf the Comforts of his Ju&s;tification?</HI> laid upon our <HI>Sanctification</HI> the fir&s;t and main Stre&s;s of our comfortable <HI>Evidence.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>Opinioni&s;ts</HI> were for another Sort of <HI>Evidence</HI> as their chief; namely, <HI>The Spirit of God by a powerful Application of a Promi&s;e,</HI> begetting in us and revealing to us a powerful <HI>A&s;&s;urance</HI> of our being ju&s;tified.</P>
<P>Now the Truth might ea&s;ily have united both of the Per&s;wa&s;ions, yet they that were of the <HI>latter Way</HI> carried the Matter on to a very <HI>perilous Door,</HI> open'd not only for new <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;tical Revelations,</HI> but al&s;o for a Neglect of &s;uch <HI>Qualifications</HI> in all <HI>Godline&s;s</HI> and <HI>Hone&s;ty,</HI> as mu&s;t be found in all that would be <HI>pro&s;pered,</HI> and not <HI>rejected</HI> in their Confidences. Yea, they employed their Di&s;tincti|ons about a <HI>Covenant of Works,</HI> and a <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> at &s;o extravagant a Rate as threatned a Subver&s;ion of all the peaceable Order in the Colonies.</P>
<P>They drove at this; That the mo&s;t virtuous Man upon Earth might not be admitted into the <HI>Churches</HI> without profe&s;&s;ing, that renouncing of <HI>Sanctification,</HI> as an Evi|dence of his good State, he waited for <HI>immediate Revela|tions</HI> to a&s;&s;ure him of it. And &s;uch as were already in <HI>Church Communion,</HI> unle&s;s they became fond of the <HI>New-Lights,</HI> in this Thing pretended unto, were pre&s;ently branded as favouring a Covenant of Works.</P>
<P>The Contention &s;pread it &s;elf into <HI>Families,</HI> and all private and &s;maller Societies, who were to be accounted under a <HI>Covenant of Works,</HI> and &s;o Enemies unto the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and who were not? which was determined among the bu&s;y <HI>Sectaries</HI> by a Per&s;on's accommodating him&s;elf unto their <HI>fine-&s;pun</HI> Speculations. <HI>Illic ip&s;um e&s;&s;e fuit promereri.</HI></P>
<P>The Di&s;turbance proceeded from thence into all the general Affairs of the Publick: The Expedition again&s;t the <HI>Pequot Indians</HI> was mo&s;t &s;hamefully di&s;couraged be|cau&s;e the Army was too much under a <HI>Covenant of Works;</HI> and the <HI>Magi&s;trates</HI> began to be contemned as being of <HI>a legal Spirit,</HI> and having therewithal a Tang of <HI>Anti-Chri&s;t</HI> in them; nor could the ordering of Town Lots, or Town Rates, or any Meeting what&s;oever e&s;cape the Confu&s;ions of this Controver&s;y.</P>
<P>'Tis incredible what Alienations of Mind, and what a very <HI>Calenture</HI> the Devil rai&s;ed in the Country upon this <HI>odd Occa&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>But it may not be ami&s;s to de&s;cribe a little more parti|cularly the <HI>Methods</HI> whereof the <HI>Devil</HI> therein &s;erved his In|tere&s;ts. The <HI>Sectaries</HI> acquainted them&s;elves with as many as po&s;&s;ibly they could, and carried on their Acquain|tance with all the <HI>Courte&s;ies</HI> and <HI>Kindne&s;&s;es</HI> that they could contrive to ingratiate them&s;elves in the Hearts of others, e&s;pecially of <HI>New-Comers</HI> into the Place; they herewithal appear'd wondrous <HI>holy, humble,</HI> &s;elf-denying and &s;piritual, and full of the mo&s;t charming Expre&s;&s;ions imaginable. <HI>Free Grace, Go&s;pel Truths, Glorious Light, and holding forth of Chri&s;t,</HI> was all their Tone: And meeting with Chri&s;tians that had any Doubts in their Minds about their own future Happine&s;s, they would in&s;inuato into them that they had never taken <HI>a right Cour&s;e for Comfort,</HI> by going to <HI>evidence</HI> their good E&s;tate by their <HI>Sanctification;</HI> but that there was a more evangelical Way to Peace, by which they them&s;elves were got above all their Fears for ever.</P>
<P>They began u&s;ually to &s;educe <HI>Women</HI> into their Notions, and by tho&s;e <HI>Women,</HI> like their fir&s;t Mother, they &s;oon hook'd in the Hu&s;band al&s;o. Having wrought them&s;elves any where into a good E&s;teem, they &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t them&s;elves with a manifold Subtilty to undermine the E&s;teem of the <HI>Mi|ni&s;ters,</HI> and intimate that their <HI>Teachers</HI> them&s;elves, never having been <HI>taught of God,</HI> had mi&s;-taught, and mi&s;led the People.&mdash;Whence it came to pa&s;s that &s;ome who had followed tho&s;e Mini&s;ters three thou&s;and Miles thr&ocirc; ten thou&s;and Deaths, yet now took up &s;uch Prejudices, not only again&s;t their <HI>Doctrines,</HI> but again&s;t their <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> al&s;o, that they did never care to hear them, or &s;ee them any more.</P>
<P>They admini&s;tred their <HI>Poi&s;ons</HI> in &s;maller <HI>Do&s;es</HI> and not without <HI>Preparations,</HI> wherein if any made any Boggle, they would pre&s;ently retreat, and &s;ay, <HI>Nay, don't mi&s;take me, for I mean the &s;ame that you do, we differ only in Words.</HI> And they would be&s;ure &s;till father their Whim&s;ies upon &s;uch Per&s;ons as were held in mo&s;t <HI>Veneration</HI> throughout the Country; but if they were brought Face to Face, they would &s;till wind out with &s;ome cunning Eva&s;ions. Thus they went on 'till they had got &s;ome noted <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> in all <HI>Order</HI> to patroni&s;e them.</P>
<P>And then it is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the Cen&s;ures, the Contempts, the Affronts ca&s;t upon the be&s;t Men in the Land, as Men <HI>ignorant of Chri&s;t;</HI> and the terrible Di&s;or|der and Contention that en&s;ued in all Societies.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;try of the Country, awakned by the&s;e <HI>Noi&s;es</HI> about the Temple, had &s;everal Meetings, that they might &s;et Matters to Rights, all which were ineffectual, until the <HI>General Court</HI> called a <HI>Synod</HI> of all the Churches in the Country to meet at <HI>Cambridge</HI> in the Year 1637.</P>
<P>The Synod being a&s;&s;embled, with the Rev. <HI>Thomas Hooker</HI> and Mr. <HI>Peter Buckley,</HI> cho&s;en its Moderators at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> (then called by the Name of <HI>New-Town</HI>) on <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 30th. 1637. there were produced about eighty-two erroneous Opinions and Expre&s;&s;ions which had been ut|tered in the Country by &s;everal Men, at &s;everal Times.</P>
<P>The Authors of the&s;e Errors were neither mentioned nor inquired; but the <HI>Errors</HI> them&s;elves were con&s;idered, confuted, and condemned from the plain <HI>Word of God.</HI> For indeed the De&s;ign of the <HI>Synod,</HI> was not <HI>Jus Dare,</HI> but only <HI>Jus Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">re,</HI> and to exerci&s;e only a Power <HI>dici&s;ive</HI> of <HI>Doctrines,</HI> not <HI>judicial</HI> on <HI>Per&s;ons,</HI> leaving it unto <HI>par|ticular Churches</HI> to pa&s;s their Cen&s;ures on the <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> who &s;hould hold the <HI>Doctrines</HI> by the Determination of the Synod found &s;ubver&s;ive to the <HI>Fundamentals of Religion.</HI> And &s;oon followed an happy Conclu&s;ion of the whole Matter.</P></Q></NOTE></P>

Again, what doth Mens flying from Mini&s;ters and Ordinances di&s;cover? Doth not this &s;hew want of Love to Chri&s;t and his Ordinances? If Mini&s;ters &s;hew them&s;elves to be unconverted, (as &s;ome &s;ay they are) let them be convicted; and if they are ob&s;tinate, let them be depo&s;ed; and let not Churches break into Pieces, becau&s;e &s;ome fondly think, and boldly &s;ay, their Mini|&s;ters are not good Men.</P>

Again, Doth not the cen&s;orious and uncharitable Spirit which &s;o much prevails in many who make high Pretences to Religion, evidently &s;hew that they are void and de&s;titute of that true Chri&s;tian Charity, which if a Man hath not he is nothing? 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.2.</P>

<HI>Again,</HI> Doth not an hankering Mind after Vi&s;ions, and Revelations, and unlearned Teachers, &s;hew a &s;ickly and di&s;temper'd State of Soul?</P>

And doth not the abounding of Mockers and Scoffers at the true Religion, and tho&s;e that appear zealous for the promoting it; and that &s;ecure, carele&s;s, and uncon|cerned Frame of Spirit which appears in many living under the Mini&s;try of God's Word, plainly &s;hew that our holy Religion is dying from among us?</P>
<P>I can't but look on the&s;e Things as &s;ad Symptoms, and if they prevail, the true Chri&s;tian Religion will lan|gui&s;h and die from among us; and we &s;hall be a dead People; &s;piritually dead, as the Church of <HI>Sardis</HI> was, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3. 1.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Con.</HI> That if the true Chri&s;tian Religion &s;hould be lo&s;t from among us, a Flood of Calamities will break in upon us, and we &s;hall be a mi&s;erable People.</P>
<P>Our holy Religion is our Beauty, Glory, Strength and Safety; and when this is lo&s;t from among us, our Beauty and Glory, Strength and Safety will be lo&s;t with it. While we pre&s;erve and promote our holy Religion, God will be with us, to protect and pre&s;erve us; but if we loo&s;e this, then God will be gone, as to his gra|cious Pre&s;ence with us, and Woe will be to us, for his Judgments will pur&s;ue and overtake us. Ho&s;.9.12. <HI>Wo to them when I depart from them.</HI></P>
<P>Look into tho&s;e Places from whence the true Chri&s;tian Religion hath been lo&s;t, and &s;ee how it is with the Peo|ple there; and as you find it in tho&s;e Places, &s;o you may expect it will be in this Land when the Religion of Chri&s;t &s;hall be lo&s;t from us.</P>
<P>True and credible Hi&s;tory gives us a &s;ad and melan|cholly Account of the Circum&s;tances of many Places from whence the true Religion hath been lo&s;t.</P>
<P>As for the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> which was once the Glory of all Lands, it hath now lo&s;t its Glory, and is
<PB N="43" REF="005173_0046_1016CFA80E6B77A0">
become a barren Soil, inhabited by Turks &amp; Heathen, a People who&s;e Religion is empty and vain.</P>
<P>And as for <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> which was called the holy City, when the true Religion flouri&s;hed in it; it is now a mi&s;erable Town, in which are no Inhabitants be&s;ide Infidels and Idolaters; and on Mount Zion, in that very Place where <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Temple &s;tood, there is now a <HI>Mo&s;que,</HI> or Turki&s;h Church for Mahomitan Wor&s;hip.<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>I. Mather</HI>'s Ichabod. p. 57.</NOTE></P>
<P>And what a mi&s;erable Place is the le&s;&s;er <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> where were &s;even famous Churches, be&s;ide many of le&s;s Note. In the &s;ixty-&s;ixth Year after Chri&s;t, <HI>Laodicea</HI> was de&s;troyed by an Earthquake; and about the Year one Hundred eighty two, the City of <HI>Smyrna</HI> came to Ruin by an Earthquake.<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><HI>Clark</HI>'s Mirrour, p. 488.</NOTE></P>
<P>And as for <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> and the other Cities that remain, they are given over to &s;trong Delu&s;ions, and to the Be|lief of doctrinal Lies.</P>
<P>And as it is with tho&s;e Places from whence the true Religion hath been lo&s;t, &s;o it may be with <HI>New-Eng|land,</HI> when our holy Religion &s;hall die from among us.</P>
<P>Therefore let us all &s;tir up our &s;elves in the Places and Stations God hath &s;et us in, to do what we can to pre|&s;erve and promote the Life of our holy Religion, which is indeed our Life.</P>
<P>And to this End let us con&s;ider, how we have left our fir&s;t Love; remember from whence we are fallen, and repent, and do our fir&s;t Works; for if this be not done, Chri&s;t will come unto us quickly, and will re|move our Candle&s;tick out of his Place; and then we &s;hall be a mi&s;erable People. But if this be done by us, he will walk in the mid&s;t of the&s;e golden Candle&s;ticks, and they &s;hall not be moved: He will help us, and that right early.</P>
