<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Maryland, Baltimore County,</HI> <DATE><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 19, 1791.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM fully &s;en&s;ible of the greatne&s;s of that free|dom, which I take with you on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion; a liberty which &s;eemed to me &s;carcely allowable, when I reflected on that di&s;tingui&s;hed and dignified &s;tation in which you &s;tand, and the almo&s;t general prejudice and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which is &s;o prevalent in the world again&s;t tho&s;e of my complexion.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e it is a truth too well atte&s;ted to you, to need a proof here, that we are a race of be|ings, who have long labored under the abu&s;e and cen&s;ure of the world; that we have long been
<PB N="4" REF="024074_0003_0FC31B4C27315340">
looked upon with an eye of contempt; and that we have long been con&s;idered rather as bruti&s;h than human, and &s;carcely capable of mental en|dowments.</P>
<P>Sir, I hope I may &s;afely admit, in con&s;equence of that report which hath reached me, that you are a man far le&s;s inflexible in &s;entiments of this nature, than many others; that you are mea&s;ur|ably friendly, and well di&s;po&s;ed towards us; and that you are willing and ready to lend your aid and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to our relief, from tho&s;e many di&s;|tre&s;&s;es, and numerous calamities, to which we are reduced.</P>
<P>Now Sir, if this is founded in truth, I appre|hend you will embrace every opportunity, to era|dicate that train of ab&s;urd and fal&s;e ideas and opi|nions, which &s;o generally prevails with re&s;pect to us; and that your &s;entiments are concurrent with mine, which are, that one univer&s;al Father hath given being to us all; and that he hath not only made us all of one fle&s;h, but that he hath al&s;o, without partiality, afforded us all the &s;ame &s;en&s;a|tions and endowed us all with the &s;ame faculties; and that however variable we may be in &s;ociety
<PB N="5" REF="024074_0004_0FC31B4E12417A28">
or religion, however diver&s;ified in &s;ituation or co|lor, we are all of the &s;ame family, and &s;tand in the &s;ame relation to him.</P>
<P>Sir, if the&s;e are &s;entiments of which you are fully per&s;uaded, I hope you cannot but acknow|ledge, that it is the indi&s;pen&s;ible duty of tho&s;e, who maintain for them&s;elves the rights of human nature, and who po&s;&s;e&s;s the obligations of Chri&s;|tianity, to extend their power and influence to the relief of every part of the human race, from what|ever burden or oppre&s;&s;ion they may unju&s;tly labor under; and this, I apprehend, a full conviction of the truth and obligation of the&s;e principles &s;hould lead all to.</P>
<P>Sir, I have long been convinced, that if your love for your&s;elves, and for tho&s;e ine&s;timable laws, which pre&s;erved to you the rights of human na|ture, was founded on &s;incerity, you could not but be &s;olicitous, that every individual, of whatever rank or di&s;tinction, might with you equally enjoy the ble&s;&s;ings thereof; neither could you re&s;t &s;ati&s;|fied &s;hort of the mo&s;t active effu&s;ion of your exer|tions, in order to their promotion from any &s;tate
<PB N="6" REF="024074_0005_0FC31B56281C0160">
of degradation, to which the unju&s;tifiable cruelty and barbari&s;m of men may have reduced them.</P>
<P>Sir, I freely and cheerfully acknowledge, that I am of the African race, and in that color which is natural to them of the deepe&s;t dye; and it is under a &s;en&s;e of the mo&s;t profound gratitude to the Supreme Ruler of the Univer&s;e, that I now confe&s;s to you, that I am not under that &s;tate of tyrannical thraldom; and inhuman captivity, to which too many of my brethren are doomed, but that I have abundantly ta&s;ted of the fruition of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, which proceed from that free and unequalled liberty with which you are favored; and which, I hope, you will willingly allow you have mercifully received, from the immediate hand of that Being, from whom proceedeth every good and perfect Gift.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;uffer me to recal to your mind that time, in which the arms and tyranny of the Briti&s;h crown were exerted, with every powerful effort, in or|der to reduce you to a &s;tate of &s;ervitude: look back, I entreat you, on the variety of dangers to which you were expo&s;ed; reflect on that time, in which every human aid appeared unavailable, and
<PB N="7" REF="024074_0006_0FC31B5B8900C388">
in which even hope and fortitude wore the a&s;pect of inability to the conflict, and you cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> led to a &s;erious and grateful &s;en&s;e of your mira|culous and providential pre&s;ervation; you cannot but acknowledge, that the pre&s;ent freedom and tranquility which you enjoy you have mercifully received, and that it is the peculiar ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven.</P>
<P>This, Sir, was a time when you cleary &s;aw into the inju&s;tice of a &s;tate of &s;lavery, and in which you had ju&s;t apprehen&s;ions of the horrors of its condition. It was now that your abhorrence thereof was &s;o excited, that you publicly held forth this true and invaluable doctrine, which is worthy to be recorded and remembered in all &s;ucceeding ages: "We hold the&s;e truths to be &s;elf-evident, that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, and that among the&s;e are, life, liberty, and the pur&s;uit of happine&s;s."</P>
<P>Here was a time, in which your tender feel|ings for your&s;elves had engaged you thus to de|clare, you were then impre&s;&s;ed with proper ideas of the great violation of liberty, and the free po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
<PB N="8" REF="024074_0007_0FC31B60181ADA48">
of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, to which you were en|titled by nature; but, Sir, how pitiable is it to reflect, that although you were &s;o fully convinced of the benevolence of the Father of Mankind, and of his equal and impartial di&s;tribution of the&s;e rights and privileges, which he hath conferred upon them, that you &s;hould at the &s;ame time counteract his mercies, in detaining by fraud and violence &s;o numerous a part of my brethren, un|der groaning captivity and cruel oppre&s;&s;ion, that you &s;hould at the &s;ame time be found guilty of that mo&s;t criminal act, which you profe&s;&s;edly de|te&s;ted in others, with re&s;pect to your&s;elves.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e that your knowledge of the &s;ituati|on of my brethren, is too exten&s;ive to need a recital here; neither &s;hall I pre&s;ume to pre&s;cribe methods by which they may be relieved, other|wi&s;e than by recommending to you and all others, to wean your&s;elves from tho&s;e narrow prejudices which you have imbibed with re|&s;pect to them, and as Job propo&s;ed to his friends, "put your &s;oul in their &s;ouls' &s;tead;" thus &s;hall your hearts be enlarged with kindne&s;s and benevolence towards them; and thus &s;hall
<PB N="9" REF="024074_0008_0FC31B6208224E50">
you need neither the direction of my&s;elf or others, in what manner to proceed herein.</P>
<P>And now, Sir, although my &s;ympathy and af|fection for my brethren hath cau&s;ed my enlarge|ment thus far, I ardently hope, that your candor and genero&s;ity will plead with you in my behalf, when I make known to you, that it was not ori|ginally my de&s;ign; but having taken up my pen in order to direct to you, as a pre&s;ent, a copy of an Almanac, which I have calculated for the &s;ucceeding year, I was unexpectedly and unavoid|ably led thereto.</P>
<P>This calculation is the production of my ardu|ous &s;tudy, in this my advanced &s;tage of life; for having long had unbounded de&s;ires to become ac|quainted with the &s;ecrets of nature, I have had to gratify my curio&s;ity herein, through my own a&s;&s;iduous application to A&s;tronomical Study, in which I need not recount to you the many diffi|culties and di&s;advantages, which I have had to encounter.</P>
<P>And although I had almo&s;t declined to make my calculation for the en&s;uing year, in con&s;e|quence
<PB N="10" REF="024074_0009_0FC31B6A30AEE7E8">
of that time which I had allotted there|for, being taken up at the Federal Territory, by the reque&s;t of Mr. Andrew Ellicott, yet finding my&s;elf under &s;everal engagements to Printers of this &s;tate, to whom I had communicated my de|&s;ign, on my return to my place of re&s;idence, I indu&s;triou&s;ly applied my&s;elf thereto, which I hope I have accompli&s;hed with correctne&s;s and accura|cy; a copy of which I have taken the liberty to direct to you, and which I humbly reque&s;t you will favorably receive; and although you may have the opportunity of peru&s;ing it after its pub|lication, yet I choo&s;e to &s;end it to you in manu|&s;cript previous thereto, that thereby you might not only have an earlier in&s;pection, but that you might al&s;o view it in my own hand writing.</P>
<P>And now, Sir, I &s;hall conclude, and &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf, with the mo&s;t profound re&s;pect,</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I THANK you, &s;incerely, for you letter of the 19th in&s;tant, and for the Almanac it con|tained. No body wi&s;hes more than I do, to &s;ee &s;uch proofs as you exhibit, that nature has given to our black brethren talents equal to tho&s;e of the other colors of men; and that the appear|ance of the want of them, is owing merely to the degraded condition of their exi&s;tence, both in Africa and America. I can add with truth, that no body wi&s;hes more ardently to &s;ee a good &s;y&s;tem commenced, for rai&s;ing the condition, both of their body and mind, to what it ought to be, as far as the imbecility of their pre&s;ent exi&s;tence, and other circum&s;tances, which cannot be ne|glected, will admit.</P>
<P>I have taken the liberty of &s;ending your Al|manac to Mon&s;ieur de Condozett, Secretary of the

<HEAD>The following Account, taken from BANNEKER's Almanac, is in&s;erted here, for the Information of the Public.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Baltimore, <DATE>Augu&s;t 20, 1791.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free Black, is about 59 years of age: he was born in Balti|more county; his father an African, and his mo|ther the offspring of African parents. His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to &s;end him to an ob&s;cure &s;chool, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic, as far as double po&s;ition; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has &s;upported him&s;elf ever &s;ince, by means of oeconomy and con&s;tant labor, and pre|&s;erved a fair reputation. To &s;truggle ince&s;&s;antly again&s;t want, is no ways favorable to improve|ment: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as &s;ome hours of lei&s;ure will occur, in the mo&s;t toil&s;ome life, he availed him&s;elf of the&s;e,
<PB N="14" REF="024074_0013_0FC31B76B450A788">
not to read and acquire knowledge, from writ|ings of genius and di&s;covery, for of &s;uch he had none, but to dige&s;t and apply, as occa&s;ions pre|&s;ented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at &s;chool. This kind of mental exerci&s;e formed his chief amu&s;e|ment, and &s;oon gave him a facility in calculation that was often &s;erviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Me&s;&s;rs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the u&s;eful mechanics. It is about three years &s;ince Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Fergu&s;on's A&s;tronomy, Leadbeat|er's Lunar Tables, and &s;ome A&s;tronomic In&s;tru|ments, but without accompanying them with ei|ther hint or in&s;truction, that might further his &s;tudies, or lead him to apply them to any u&s;eful re&s;ult. The&s;e books and in&s;truments, the fir&s;t of the kind he had ever &s;een, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employ|ed his lei&s;ure in A&s;tronomical Re&s;earches.</P>
<P>He now took up the idea of the calculati|ons for an Almanac, and actually completed an entire &s;et for the la&s;t year, upon his original
<PB N="15" REF="024074_0014_0FC31B8112208890">
&s;tock of Arithmetic. Encouraged by this fir&s;t at|tempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he begun and fi|ni&s;hed without the lea&s;t information or a&s;&s;i&s;tance from any per&s;on, or other books than tho&s;e I have mentioned; &s;o that whatever merit is attached to his pre&s;ent performance, is exclu&s;ively and pecu|liarly his own.</P>
<P>I have been the more careful to inve&s;tigate tho&s;e particulars, and to a&s;certain their reality, as they form an intere&s;ting fact in the Hi&s;tory of Man; and as you may want them to gratify cu|rio&s;ity, I have no objection to your &s;electing them for your account of Benjamin.</P>
