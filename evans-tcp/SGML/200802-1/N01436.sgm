<HEAD>Of the Fir&s;t, viz. Some things premi&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Introduction, touching Banks in general.</HEAD>
<P>MOney, whether Gold or Silver, is but a mea&s;ure of the value of other things; yet hath, for a long Succe&s;&s;ion of Ages (e&s;pecially in the Civilized and Trading part of
<PB N="2" REF="001703_0004_0FB62967A366F148">
the World) obtained to be the u&s;ual, and be&s;t known means of Interchange.</P>
<P>This mea&s;ure and way of Interchange, was ori|ginally occa&s;ioned by the experimented inconve|niences of common Barter; in which way, unle&s;s both the Parties dealing, have like occa&s;ion, re|ciprocally, of each others Commodities, the le&s;s nece&s;&s;itous Over-reaches the greater, by impo&s;ing the price of both, to his own advantage, and the others detriment, which is not equal; nor can there be Equality where there is no common Standard between them.</P>
<P>But, whether the Mines fail, or Men have not been &s;o fore-&s;eeing and indu&s;trious to bring in, to mo&s;t Countreys, a &s;ufficiency of Money or Bul|lion, wherewith to manage their increa&s;ing Trades, or, that Traders, for want of other Returns, have been nece&s;&s;itated, for Balance of the Sur|charge of Goods imported, to remit the Coyns of &s;ome Countreys into others: Or, for other Cau&s;es (not nece&s;&s;ary on this occa&s;ion to be fur|ther inquired into) tis now &s;o hard to come by, in &s;ome places, for carrying on of Trade, to an|&s;wer the va&s;tne&s;s of Mens attempts, and aims of increa&s;e in Merchandize, as that its found, in many Countreys, in&s;ufficient in this Age of the World: And that hath put divers Per&s;ons and Countreys, upon contrivances how to &s;upply that Deficiency, by other Mediums; &s;ome of which have happily pitch'd upon that of Banks, Lum|bards, and Exchange of Moneys by Bills, which have thriven with them.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="001703_0005_0FB6296B776E9CE0">
The two former of the&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> Banks and Lum|bards, have been &s;et on foot in divers Trading Countreys, by their re&s;pective Publick Underta|kings, and have &s;ucceeded to their abundant In|riching. Perhaps others have thought, that would have occa&s;ion'd the overflowing of Moneys among&s;t them: E&s;pecially if they rai&s;ed the Va|lues of Gold &amp; Silver above the common Standard; but as they have been mi&s;taken, or their Surfeit of Trade hath ob&s;cured the vi&s;ibility of it; and protracted more rational Con&s;iderations of Re|dre&s;&s;ing, till it hath proved almo&s;t Fatal, to the impoveri&s;hing of their Countreys: So the other have really experimented, that their Banks have been, as well with other Countries, as among&s;t them&s;elves, of greater Value than the Species of Gold and Silver: And yet, &s;uch Places drain away the &s;aid Species from the other, who under tho&s;e mi&s;taken apprehen&s;ions have Courted it, as the only real good thing for a Countrey.</P>
<P>The Third, <HI>viz.</HI> that of Exchange of Moneys, hath been for the mo&s;t part managed by the re|&s;pective Merchants of all places; who in their par|ticular Dealings and Corre&s;pondences (fore-lay|ing Advantages to them&s;elves thereby) have un|accountably controll'd it, and vary it often, in each Annual Revolution.</P>
<P>'Tis not to be doubted, but that all Three of the&s;e may be accommodated &amp; improved, to the Publick Advantage of any Countrey: E&s;pecially, if managed in Partner&s;hip by Private Hands, be|ing per&s;ons of known Integrity, Prudence and
<PB N="4" REF="001703_0006_0FB6297FA8FBAB30">
E&s;tates: &s;ubjecting the annual Profits accruing thereby to the an&s;wering the Injury, damage, or lo&s;s, by their undertaking.</P>
<P>The be&s;t Foundation for &s;uch an Attempt, is, that of Real and Per&s;onal E&s;tates, in&s;tead of the <HI>Species</HI> of Gold and Silver. For, as a Bank of Moneys is liable to many ca&s;ualties and hazards; &s;o, the hoarding up of Moneys in Banks, nece&s;&s;i|tates the taking out the more Bills; which is one Malady this Propo&s;ed Bank will cure.</P>
<P>We &s;hall therefore, at pre&s;ent, begin with, and principally di&s;cour&s;e of the two fir&s;t of the&s;e: <HI>viz.</HI> The Bank of Credit, as it may be rendred &s;u&s;ceptible of the Second, <HI>viz.</HI> The Lumbard, con|junct: accounting both the one and the other to be founded as afore&s;aid, <HI>viz.</HI> On Lands or Real E&s;tates mortgaged, and &s;taple durable Goods, and Merchandi&s;es depo&s;ited: &s;uch as any Countreys Products and Manufactures will by Art and In|du&s;try produce and furni&s;h.</P>
<P>Here might be al&s;o di&s;cours'd, A Lumbard for the Poor, by &s;ome called, <HI>Mons Pietatis:</HI> But that's fitter to be the Handmaid of the other; for, 'twill be too poor to encourage an under|taking by it &s;elf, or for a beginning: Neither will there be any &s;uch nece&s;&s;ity thereof, when this Bank is &s;ettled; fora&s;much as this will im|ploy mo&s;t of tho&s;e, who are u&s;ually maintained in Idlene&s;s, if they will betake them&s;elves to In|du&s;try, at &s;uch moderate wages as would en|able them to live comfortably, without expo&s;ing their Imployers to like Poverty with them&s;elves.
<PB N="5" REF="001703_0007_0FB6298120683038">
And be&s;ides, this Bank of Credit and Lumbard, when under&s;tood, and received in any Countrey with general Approbation, will in due time ren|der that, as al&s;o the Third, <HI>viz.</HI> that of the Ex|change of Moneys by Bills, the more intelligible, and as u&s;eful.</P>

<HEAD>Of the &s;econd Particular, viz. The definition of &s;uch a Bank.</HEAD>

<P>Obj. <HI>But how is that Po&s;&s;ible or Credible?</HI></P>

<P>The State of <HI>Venice</HI> enacted &s;everal Laws again&s;t their pa&s;&s;ing &s;o high: which failing to accompli&s;h what was required, at length they conceived it nece&s;&s;ary, in order to the bringing down the Price, to propo&s;e the giving forth Bills for <HI>Three Hundred Thou&s;and Duckets</HI> more: By which means they

<P>Much more might be &s;aid upon this Subject, but the&s;e &s;eem to be &s;ufficient, for incouraging an at|tempt: And, the experiments of the things &s;ug|ge&s;ted will give &s;uch clear Demon&s;trations of the U&s;efulne&s;s, Advantage, Nece&s;&s;ity &amp; Security of &s;uch Banks, in mo&s;t places, beyond all others that have been hitherto put in practice, as tho&s;e who are not &s;o prompt to receive things into their un|der&s;tandings by the Notions of them, or are pre|judiced by mi&s;taken apprehen&s;ions about them, &amp; thence rai&s;e many impertinent Objections (not worth &s;cribling) may be pre&s;umed will follow o|thers Examples, in well-doing, when tho&s;e are ob&s;erved to thrive who go before therein.</P>

<HEAD>We &s;hall therefore, for the Conclu&s;ion, which is the la&s;t Particular mentioned, to be Di&s;cour&s;ed, Sum up all, in this general A&s;&s;ertion, viz.</HEAD>
<P>THat there will ari&s;e many more Convenien|ces &amp; Advantages, by this Bank, to &s;uch Coun|treys where they &s;hall be erected, than have been enumerated, in the &s;everal foregoing in&s;tances; or, well, can be.</P>

1. By this, the Trade &amp; Wealth of any Country is e&s;tabli&s;h'd upon its own Foundation: and upon a <HI>Medium</HI> or <HI>Balance</HI> ari&s;ing within it &s;elf, <HI>viz.</HI> The Lands &amp; Products of &s;uch Countrey, &amp; not upon the Importation of Gold or Silver; or the Scarcity or Plenty of them, or, of any thing el&s;e Imported from Foreign Nations, which may be with-held, prohibited, or enhan&s;ed, at the Plea&s;ure of others.</P>
<P N="2"> 2. The Native Commodities of &s;uch Countrys will thus become improved to a &s;ufficiency <HI>(at lea&s;t)</HI> for their own U&s;e; and thereby afford a comfor|table Sub&s;i&s;tence to many ingenuous &amp; indu&s;trious Per&s;ons, in &s;uch Countrys, who know not how to Sub&s;i&s;t: E&s;pecially &s;uch as are Bani&s;h'd, or inforced to for&s;ake their Native Countrys, by rea&s;on of the heat of Per&s;ecution, upon the account of Religion.</P>
<P N="3">3. It will not be in the Power of any, by Extor|tion &amp; Oppre&s;&s;ion, to make a Prey of the Nece&s;&s;itous.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Fi&s;hery of &s;uch Countrys, as lye conve|nient for it, may be improved: and the Naviga|tion &amp; Shipping increa&s;ed, for U&s;e or Sale.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Publick Revenues thereof, in con&s;e|quence of the&s;e, will be augmented.</P>
<P N="6">6. The Rents of Lands, yea, the Purcha&s;e value thereof, will ri&s;e: For, the Plenty of Money, or a valuable Credit equivalent thereunto, &amp; the Low|ering of Intere&s;t, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have that effect.</P>
<P N="7">7. It will &s;upply the defect or &s;carcity of Mo|neys in Specie, until by the &s;etling of <HI>Manufactures,</HI> &amp;<HI>c.</HI> (which this Bank propo&s;es) the Products of &s;uch Countrey for Exportation &s;hall come to Ba|lance or Exceed the value of it's Importations&punc;
<PB N="27" REF="001703_0029_0FB62A09A71084D0">
which afterwards will nece&s;&s;itate the bringing in of Moneys, as fa&s;t as the want thereof hath carried it away. For, the true ground of the Plenty or Scarcity of Moneys in any Countrey, is not the high or low Value of the Money (as &s;ome errone|ou&s;ly conceive) but, that the Value of Goods Im|ported from other parts hath been greater than that of the Export. The Balance whereof mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be an&s;wer'd with Moneys, &amp; for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, Revers'd, the Export of Goods when bro't to exceed the value of the Import, mu&s;t, as nece&s;&s;arily bring it back again to &s;uch proportion as the Export can be rai&s;ed. And what&s;oever o|ther means may be &s;ugge&s;ted for furni&s;hing of Moneys, mu&s;t be fruitle&s;s, for, there will abide no more than &s;uch proportion; let what Value will be put on Moneys above the Currant Price there|of in other Countrys with whom they &s;hall Trade; which may be further Evidenced, if this hint thereof be not &s;ufficiently intelligible. To which may be added, That the le&s;s need there is of Mo|neys in Specie, by rea&s;on of &s;uch Currant Credit, the more will be the increa&s;e of Money it &s;elf; as is manife&s;t in <HI>Holland, Venice,</HI> &amp; all Places where Bank-credit &s;upplies the defect of tho&s;e Species; lea&s;t, the Money that remains in &s;uch Countreys, will be at greater liberty for &s;uch petty occa&s;ions as cannot be &s;o well accommodated by Bills.</P>
<P>In Order therefore, &amp; as Praevious to the En|tring upon &s;uch an Affair, tis requi&s;ite that other Queries be Propounded and Re&s;olved, viz.</P>
<P>Q. 4. <HI>How &s;hall it come to be known whether a &s;ufficient number of Per&s;ons, of all Ranks, Trades
<PB N="28" REF="001703_0030_0FB62A0B91EA78B8">
and Callings, will deal with this Bank?</HI> The Rea|&s;ons of which Inquiry are the&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) It will be of u&s;e to the undertakers of &s;uch Bank to know it, for their incouragement in their entrance upon this affair. And,</P>
<P N="2">(2.) To &s;uch others as would take the Bills, if they were &s;atisfied they could buy &s;uch Goods, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> as they want, with Bills, at as ea&s;ie rates, as if they had ready Moneys to give.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 1. It will be requi&s;ite, that a &s;hort De|claration be tendred to be Sub&s;cribed by &s;ome Per|&s;ons of all Ranks, Trades &amp; Callings; &s;ignifying that they will accept the &s;aid Bank-bills of Credit, in their ordinary future dealings of Buying &amp; Sel|ling, or other Traffiquing affairs, whereupon they are to receive Moneys, for &s;o much ready Moneys as &s;hall be in &s;uch Bills mentioned, upon the Terms &amp; according to the Rules of the Bank: Saving to every man his Specialties, &amp; particular Contracts.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 2. That &s;uch as &s;hall &s;o declare them&s;elves, by Sub&s;cription (or otherwi&s;e) may be put into Alphabetical Li&s;ts, and, &s;uch as take forth Bills may be informed of the Names of the &s;aid re|&s;pective Per&s;ons, their Trades or Callings, and Places of Habitation. But,</P>
<P>Q. 5. It may be further inquired, viz. <HI>What if &s;ome &s;orts of Per&s;ons requi&s;ite for a univer&s;al Circula|tion of Bills, will not, in all ca&s;es, ingage to accept Bank-bills: but &s;ome will wholly Refu&s;e them, &amp; Cry up Mo|neys, inhans'd to a higher Rate than they pa&s;s at in o|ther Countreys,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Others will be for either, or both, as they find it for their Advantage,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="001703_0031_0FB62A0FEEE1C908">
<HI>An&s;w.</HI> Its not nece&s;&s;ary that all &s;hould, in all ca&s;es, oblige them&s;elves to Bills, as long as there is Moneys to be had: But if there be not a &s;ufficien|cy of that for carrying on of Trade, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> as, this Bank hinders not the Currency of Moneys, but that may be imployed as far as it will go, (which, for the mo&s;t part, during the Scarcity of it, will be in &s;mall dealings,) &s;o, the Bills will be found u&s;eful to &s;upply the defect. The needful pro|portion whereof will &s;oon be under&s;tood; and each Per&s;on will ca&s;t his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and make his Contracts accordingly: And con&s;equently, this need not hinder, or di&s;courage the attempt; if there be a competent number of each, or mo&s;t &s;orts, that cannot, otherwi&s;e, deal as they would.</P>
<P>Q. 6. And, if any &s;hall inquire, <HI>What Number of Merchants and other Tradesmen may be &s;ufficient (at fir&s;t erecting &s;uch a Bank) to a&s;&s;i&s;t a Circulation of Bills in Trade, in ca&s;e &s;ome &s;hould, not only withdraw from, but, ob&s;truct, &amp; mi&s;repre&s;ent the Affair, or Per&s;ons managing it, as not having the Publick Approbation, or Sanction of the Authority of a Countrey, which they may &s;ugge&s;t to be nece&s;&s;ary?</HI> It's An&s;wered,</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 1. A few Merchants in any Countrey who are general Traders (by the help this Bank propo&s;es, in the foregoing In&s;tances,) may be &s;uf|ficient to give encouragement for the Entrance upon this Affair; and &s;o many Shop-keepers, Ar|tificers, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> as mu&s;t and will deal with them.</P>
<P>For,</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 2. It may rea&s;onably be pre&s;umed, that, many, in the practice of the thing, will appre|hend
<PB N="30" REF="001703_0032_0FB62A12801053B0">
the nece&s;&s;ity, u&s;efulne&s;s, and &s;ecurity there|of, who cannot ea&s;ily take it up in the Notion, or by Di&s;cour&s;e&punc; and that &s;uch will come in by Degrees: for, if, (being Merchants) they &s;tand out, &s;uch of their Chap-men as &s;hall find it their intere&s;t to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ell for Bills, mu&s;t buy again of others who will take them in payment; and finding them|&s;elves well u&s;ed by &s;uch, will hardly return where they have been refu&s;ed: and, if of other Profe&s;&s;i|ons they mu&s;t either Sell little, or do it on Tru&s;t, or wait for payment till moneys grow more plen|tiful; while&s;t others carry away the whole Tra|ding among them.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 3. This part of the Merchants Calling, is, in every re&s;pect as Free and Lawfull for any to undertake, and needs no more of Publick Encou|ragement or Countenance, than that part of buy|ing and &s;elling (at home or abroad) with or for ready Money, Time, or Barter, which they better under&s;tand &amp; practi&s;e. And the managers hereof may as well expect a Benefit by it as the others: Fora&s;much as it will no le&s;s take up their time to attend; and will be an improving the Trade of any Countrey, no le&s;s than the other: And la&s;tly, has its Hazards attending it; for the Profits accruing thereby, are, in the fir&s;t place a&s;&s;igned, by the Con|&s;titution and Rules thereof, for making good all Lo&s;&s;es &amp; Damages that may happen, in the Ma|nagement of this Affair.</P>
