<P>IT is ju&s;tly expected of every phy&s;ician, that at lea&s;t, he will enquire into the virtues of &s;uch &s;ub&s;tances, as &s;hall offer them&s;elves to his ob&s;er|vation, &s;uppo&s;ed to po&s;&s;e&s;s active medicinal qual|ities: for "The Lord hath created medicines out of the earth; and he that is wi&s;e will not abhor them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> xxxviii. 4.</NOTE>".

<P>AMERICAN phy&s;icians, in particular, from their being &s;ituated in a country, with re&s;pect to me|dical re&s;earches, almo&s;t unexplored, mu&s;t con&s;ider it doubly incumbent on them, to attend to its productions; for be&s;ides the ipecacuanha, the nake-root, the jalap, and many other u&s;eful re|medies;

<P>THESE reflections prevailed upon me, notwith|&s;tanding a &s;urrounding cloud of difficulties<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The mo&s;t able profe&s;&s;ions in Europe, &s;ay, that <Q>The analy&s;is of mineral waters, is ju&s;tly con&s;idered, one of the mo&s;t difficult problems in chemi&s;try.</Q></NOTE>, to at|tempt to a&s;certain the compo&s;ition of the mineral wa|ters of Saratoga&mdash;whether I have fully &s;ucceeded or not, my experiments, (which I have in&s;erted at full length, for that purpo&s;e,) with the &s;kilful chemi&s;t will determine; In the mean time, not doubting but that his knowledge of the intricacy of the &s;ub|ject will furni&s;h him with a cover for the little in|accuracies he may detect, particularly when he con&s;iders, that in this work, I have acted in the dangerous and toil&s;ome capacity of a pioneer, I have opened a way to the analy&s;is of the&s;e waters, whereby others may follow on, probably with more &s;ucce&s;s, at lea&s;t with le&s;s difficulty<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">No one has heretofore attempted to analy&s;e the&s;e waters, all that has been done, was merely &s;kimming their &s;urface; ju&s;t an enquiry into the nature of the air di&s;charged from them; &s;ee Dr. Mitchell's experiments, related in the Ameri|can Mu&s;eum, Vol. IV.

IT has been my intention to render this treati&s;e as generally u&s;eful as po&s;&s;ible; I have, therefore, not only forborn the u&s;e of the new and accurate nomenclature of the French chemi&s;ts; but have al&s;o, in other re&s;pects, employed as familiar terms as the nature of the &s;ubject would admit of; and as in compo&s;itions of this kind, beauty of &s;tile is le&s;s aimed at, than per&s;picuity of expre&s;&s;ion&mdash;I doubt not but that the reader will excu&s;e me, if he finds &s;ome &s;entences which might have been expre&s;&s;ed in more elegant language.</P>
<P>WHETHER water of it&s;elf con&s;idered, is a &s;im|ple elementary &s;ub&s;tance, according to the opinion of the ancients, or a compound, as a&s;&s;erted by many of the moderns, though, perhaps, well de|&s;erving of attention, is not the bu&s;ine&s;s of this di&s;&s;ertation to determine? Its views being confin|ed, merely to di&s;cover the nature of &s;uch mineral &s;ub&s;tances, as are often di&s;&s;olved in it, and to which many waters owe their particular medici|nal virtues.</P>
<P>SUCH mineral waters have been noticed as far back as the time of <HI>Hyppocrates. Pliny</HI> mentions certain of them, as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing medicinal proper|ties; but we do not find any account of a method to detect their compo&s;ition, till about the middle of the &s;eventeenth century, when <HI>Boyle</HI> fir&s;t ob|&s;erved, that the infu&s;ion of vegetable blues, was an accurate te&s;t for di&s;covering the pre&s;ence of un|combined acids or alkalies, by becoming red with
<PB N="ix" REF="026149_0007_0FCF55DD66071B80">
the former, and green with the latter. He after|wards found out many other &s;ub&s;tances, for the more full examination of waters.</P>
<P>DURING the time that <HI>Boyle</HI> was employed in the&s;e re&s;earches, <HI>Duclos</HI> was bu&s;y in the analy&s;is of the waters of France, and made &s;everal improve|ments, by the addition of galls, and the tincture of turn&s;ol, to our &s;tock of regents. <HI>Hierne, Val|lerius, Boulduc</HI> and many other celebrated che|mi&s;ts, continued to render this branch of &s;cience more perfect.</P>
<P>IN the beginning of the pre&s;ent century, <HI>Hoff|man,</HI> followed by <HI>Springsfield</HI> and <HI>Venel,</HI> paid par|ticular attention to what they called the mineral &s;pirit of waters, and which &s;ince, by <HI>Dr. Prie&s;tly,</HI> has been proved to be the aerial or cretacious acid.</P>
<P>THE mode of anali&s;ing waters have been con|tinually improving, &s;ince the fir&s;t experiments of <HI>Boyle</HI>&mdash;till at length the celebrated <HI>Bergman</HI> has given the fini&s;hing &s;troke of its pre&s;ent perfection.</P>
<P>IN examining the&s;e waters. I have proceeded first by <HI>reagents,</HI> to a&s;certain the different ingre|dients in their compo&s;ition: for notwith&s;tanding a late author<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE> con&s;iders the&s;e as mere amu&s;ing experiments, yet I rather &s;uppo&s;e them very u&s;e|ful means, nor that purpo&s;e, particularly when ap|plied in the exten&s;ive manner that I have done; and I fancy every reader will be of my opinion,

upon a candid peru&s;al of this di&s;&s;ertation: I ac|knowledge we are thereby only enabled to di&s;co|ver the different ingredients of mineral waters&mdash;but not the proportion of each. I was, therefore, obliged to apply to <HI>di&s;tillation,</HI> to obtain the pro|portion of their aerial, and to <HI>evaporation</HI> and <HI>chry&s;talization</HI>&mdash;that of their fixed principles.</P>

<HEAD>A DISSERTATION ON THE MINERAL WATERS OF SARATOGA, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>A topographical de&s;cription of the country, and &s;itu|ation of the &s;everal &s;prings.</HEAD>
<P>THESE &s;prings are &s;ituated on the we&s;terly &s;ide of a valley, which lies about twelve miles we&s;t of the conflux of Fi&s;h-Creek, with the North River<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Which is about two hundred miles above the city of New-York.</NOTE>, in the country of Saratoga, and &s;tate of New-York. This valley, at lea&s;t the part of it where the &s;prings ri&s;e, runs a northerly and &s;outherly cour&s;e, and appears to have been form|ed by a branch of the Kayadoro&s;eres river; which flows through the middle of it. The high ground that forms the we&s;terly bank of the valley, and which appears to &s;upply the waters of the&s;e &s;prings, which are &s;ituated at its foot, is compo&s;ed, almo&s;t entirely, of calcarious rocks,
<PB N="12" REF="026149_0010_0FCF4CB05E1687A8">
who&s;e &s;urface, however, is mo&s;tly over&s;pread with a &s;and and clayey &s;oil, and covered with tall pines and oaks: there are &s;everal deep &s;ubterra|neous caverns ob&s;erved in it, which open but a &s;mall di&s;tance from where the declivity commenc|es. The bank on the ea&s;terly &s;ide appears almo&s;t entirely &s;and, with not the lea&s;t ve&s;tige of calca|rious earth, and is a perfect pine plane.</P>
<P>THE cau&s;e of this &s;udden change of &s;oil, which however, is not peculiar to this place alone<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As Hemp&s;tead plains on Long I&s;land and its contiguous &s;oil is a remarkable in&s;tance.</NOTE>, and al&s;o of the river's making its way, at this particu|lar juncture&mdash;I leave to the &s;peculation of the na|turali&s;t to determine, a mere knowledge of their exi&s;tence and &s;ituation being all that is nece&s;&s;ary, either as to their affording us an a&s;&s;i&s;tant means for a&s;certaining the nature of the mineral waters, in their neighbourhood, or as enabling us to ac|count for the pre&s;ence of ingredients we may find in them. About four miles we&s;t of the&s;e &s;prings, I am informed there is a &s;trong &s;cented &s;ulphuri|ous &s;pring.</P>
<P>THE &s;prings are eight or ten in number, and all are within the &s;pace of about half a mile; the one which has particularly attracted the atten|tion of the curious, and which is mo&s;tly drank by valetudinarians, ri&s;es about midway between the others; it is entirely &s;urrounded by a rock of a conical &s;hape, which is about five &s;ect high,
<PB N="13" REF="026149_0011_0FCF55E1C0F83310">
and who&s;e ba&s;e is about nine feet in diameter; it has a circular hole, in its apex, of near ten inches acro&s;s, which is the opening of its inner cavity in which the water ri&s;es to within about two feet of its top. This cavity, like the out&s;ide of the rock, enlarges, as it de&s;cends. The &s;urface of this rock is of a browni&s;h colour, and appears compact and poli&s;hed, it has a check in one &s;ide of it, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to de&s;cend internally and form &s;ome vent below the &s;urface of the ground, by which the water makes its way out, as it has not been known to overflow for &s;everal years pa&s;t. The crack is believed to have been pro|duced by the fall of a tree over the &s;pring; and the remains of the upper part of one which lies in the mar&s;h below, and who&s;e body is directly immediately towards it, renders this opinion ve|ry probable, &s;ince its &s;ize and &s;ituation prove that it mu&s;t have &s;tood on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the rock; indeed I am informed, by a man of that country, that he very well recollects when the tree &s;tood there, and that then the water overflowed the rock: another per&s;on informed me, that he knew it to overflow in the time of the late war.</P>
<P>THESE waters naturally depo&s;it a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> matter where they flow; thereby forming to them&s;elves, a barrier of defence again&s;t the intru|&s;ion of heterogeneous &s;ub&s;tances: the rea&s;on why the <HI>rock &s;pring</HI> (as the one ju&s;t de&s;cribed is called) in particular has &s;urrounded it&s;elf by &s;uch a regu|lar
<PB N="14" REF="026149_0012_0FCF4CB4B7851E98">
formed pyramidial ma&s;s&mdash;I take to be owing to its natural &s;ituation rendering it more inacce&s;|&s;ible to the animals, that may have re&s;orted here for the waters, (which they appear to be very fond of, as well as of licking &s;ub&s;tances about the &s;prings, on account of their &s;aline impregnation,) whence is has, perhaps, during the cour&s;e of ages, been permitted, unmole&s;tedly, to precipitate par|ticles upon particles of its &s;tony matter, till final|ly, it has attained its pre&s;ent appearance, while a &s;pring, a &s;mall di&s;tance from it, which, (from its &s;upplying the waters that are continually convey|ed from it, by a little wooden gutter, fixed for that purpo&s;e, into the bathing tub; which is &s;itu|ated in a log inclo&s;ure, ju&s;t below it in the mar&s;h) is called the <HI>bathing &s;pring;</HI> which, notwith&s;tand|ing it has afforded a much greater quantity of this petrefactive depo&s;ition, &s;o as to form an irregular rock, of about twenty one feet in diameter, around it&s;elf, by being more ea&s;ily come at, has had its tender layers trodden down continually, as they formed, before they could a&s;&s;ume any regular &s;hape.</P>
<P>THE <HI>&s;tony matter</HI> of the&s;e &s;prings, by calcina|tion, forms <HI>quicklime.</HI></P>
<P>A PIECE of it, put into <HI>vitriolic acid,</HI> cau&s;ed a great efferve&s;cence, and formed a <HI>&s;elenites,</HI> or <HI>pla&s;ter of Paris,</HI> and al&s;o a &s;mall portion of <HI>allum,</HI> proved, by the &s;olutions depo&s;iting a cloudy <HI>&s;edi|ment,</HI> by pa&s;&s;ing <HI>volatile alkaline gas</HI> through it;

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>THE NATURE OF THE WATERS.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Fir&s;t. Of their phy&s;ical properties.</HEAD>
<P>I. THESE waters, in general, appear <HI>nearly</HI> tran&s;parent, yet none of them are perfectly &s;o, excepting that which ri&s;es up in a barrel, which the neighbours have fixed for the purpo&s;e of col|lecting it, and is called the <HI>barrel &s;pring;</HI> they are <HI>colourle&s;s,</HI> and emit a great quantity of <HI>air</HI> by agitation, even by &s;tanding &s;till in an open ve&s;|&s;el, it almo&s;t immediately forms bubbles around its in&s;ide, which &s;oon ri&s;e up and are di&s;charged. The ve&s;&s;el u&s;ed to dip the water out of the rock, and al&s;o the bathing tub, &s;oon gather an <HI>ochery cru&s;t</HI> upon their inner &s;urfaces. Where|ever the&s;e waters &s;tagnate, around the &s;prings, be&s;ides depo&s;iting the &s;tony matter before menti|oned, they al&s;o &s;oon become covered with a <HI>pellicle</HI> of a metallic &s;plendour, reflecting variegated colours.</P>
<P>II. THEY diffu&s;e a <HI>&s;ubtle penetrating odour,</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="026149_0014_0FCF55E4CA6E6130">
which is mo&s;t particularly experienced by breath|ing in the orifice of the rock.</P>
<P>III. WHEN drank, their fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion on the palate, is agreeably <HI>ace&s;cent,</HI> &s;ucceed by a nau&s;e|ous &s;aline ta&s;te; they afterwards give up ace&s;cent eructations, like fermented liquors, and which are no ways unplea&s;ant.</P>
<P>IV. THE hydrometer &s;tands at the &s;ame height in the&s;e, as in &s;now water.</P>
<P>V. NOTWITHSTANDING the di&s;charge of air from the&s;e waters, makes them appear to be in a continued ebulition, yet they are cold, the tem|perature, however, is not the &s;ame in all the &s;prings; but &s;eems to dimini&s;h in proportion to their bri&s;kne&s;s, thus the bathing &s;pring and the barrel, each of which di&s;charges about twenty gallons in an hour, which is much more than the re&s;t do, lowered Fatherinheits thermometre from 72&deg;, the heat of the atmo&s;phere, to 52&deg;, while in the others it &s;tood at 56&deg; and 58&deg;, but in the rock water, which runs very &s;lowly, it remained at 67&deg;.</P>
<P>VI. BY the application of a gentle heat, the&s;e waters di&s;charge a great quantity of <HI>air</HI> in bub|bles; it is upon this property, that their u&s;e in rai&s;ing bread depends, and for which purpo&s;e they are carried away in con&s;iderable quantities, daily, even &s;ometimes to eight or ten miles di&s;tance; all that is nece&s;&s;ary being merely to make the dough, with flour and this water alone, and it is imme|diately ready to put in the oven.</P>

<PB N="17" REF="026149_0015_0FCF55E64863FAD0">
<HEAD>II. EXPERIMENTS UPON THE AIR.</HEAD>
<P>I. A <HI>lighted candle</HI> let down in the crater of the rock, was immediately <HI>extingui&s;hed,</HI> both blaze and wick, before it came within a foot of the &s;urface of the water: the air obtained by agi|tating the water of this, as well as of the other &s;prings, was equally incapable of &s;upporting com|bu&s;tion, as was al&s;o that collected from the bub|bles, that were continually di&s;charging from the different &s;prings.</P>
<P>II. A <HI>chicken</HI> being immer&s;ed in this air, <HI>expired</HI> in three minutes. A <HI>kitten</HI> confined in it for one and a half minutes, appeared very flaccid and al|mo&s;t dead; yet, on being brought out, into free atmo&s;pheric air, its fleeting life was &s;oon recalled through the medium of violent convul&s;ions; be|ing again put into the noxious gas, in fourteen minutes it was irrecoverably <HI>dead.</HI></P>
<P>III. THE air being made to pa&s;s through <HI>lime-water</HI> immediately rendered it very <HI>turbid.</HI></P>
<P>IV. IT rendered a diluted <HI>tincture of turn&s;ol</HI> of <HI>a red</HI> tinge, by pa&s;&s;ing through it.</P>

<P>FROM the&s;e experiments, I conclude, that the&s;e waters contain,</P>
<P>I. <HI>An uncombined</HI> ACID, whereby they become red by tincture of turn&s;ol, and that this cannot be a fixed acid, &s;ince it does not redden infu&s;ion of lark-&s;pur, and is evaporated by boiling; for af|terwards the water does not change tincture of turn&s;ol; therefore it mu&s;t be the <HI>cretacious acid,</HI> the &s;ame as has been heretofore proved to be con|tinually di&s;charging from them, in large quanti|ties: it is from the pre&s;ence of this, that lime-water becomes &s;o very turbid; for with lime it forms an in&s;oluble compound.</P>
<P>II. IRON.&mdash;Hence it takes a purple tinge, with tincture of galls, and al&s;o, when previou&s;ly joined with vitriolic acid, becomes blue, with Pru&s;ian lime-water, and that the iron is not kept in &s;olution, by the vitriolic acid, or it would have
<PB N="22" REF="026149_0020_0FCF55ED2656D990">
become blue by this te&s;t, before the acid was united with it; but by the cretacious acid, &s;ince after being boiled, this water is no more di&s;colour|ed, by tincture of galls.</P>
<P>III. A QUANTITY of LIME <HI>held in &s;olution by the cretacious acid;</HI> for notwit&s;tanding lime, as above ob&s;erved, is rendered in&s;oluble by uniting with the cretacious acid, yet it is otherwi&s;e when &s;u|per&s;aturated therewith; for then it is, to the con|trary, much more &s;oluble: hence the cau&s;e of a precipitation, by the cau&s;tic vegetable, and vola|tile alkalies. They, from their affinity to the acid, deprive the lime of its &s;uperabundance, and per|mit it to fall down in a white powder. The vi|triolic acid, on the contrary, attracts the lime, and forms a gyp&s;eous depo&s;ition, while the cretacious acid flies off in a great efferve&s;cence. The acid of &s;ugar, al&s;o, evinces the pre&s;ence of lime, by uniting and forming an in&s;oluble compound with it. The&s;e te&s;ts did not exhibit the &s;ame ap|pearances with the water, after ebulition: hence the pellicle and depo&s;ition formed, during that proce&s;s, I take to be calcarious earth and iron.</P>
<P>IV. A MURIATIC ACID. Hence with ni|trated &s;ilver it forms a &s;udden, ca&s;eous precipi|tate, and al&s;o a precipitate with nitrated mercury; this la&s;t precipitate on being &s;ublimed, afforded corro&s;&s;ive &s;ublimate.</P>
<P>V. A NEUTRAL SALT. Since they have
<PB N="23" REF="026149_0021_0FCF4CC56375F120">
been proved by the two la&s;t mentioned experi|ments, to contain a marine acid, and by &s;ome of the previous ones, that this cannot exi&s;t in a &s;epe|rate &s;tate; therefore it mu&s;t be united either with an earth, or an alkali, and as a cretacious alkali will be &s;hewn to be pre&s;ent in the water, it is evi|dent that it mu&s;t be joined with the latter; &s;ince alkalies have a greater attraction for acids, than earths have.</P>
<P>VI. A CRETACIOUS ALKALI, whereby, after the water has been boiled, it renders the infu&s;ion of lark-&s;pur green, and efferve&s;ces with vitriolic acid; this may al&s;o be the cau&s;e why lime-water is &s;till precipitated by it. Here the cretacious acid quits the alkali, to unite with its more at|tracting lime, forming therewith, as abovemen|tioned, an in&s;oluble compound. The rea&s;on why the water did not change the infu&s;ion of lark|&s;pur, before it had been boiled, mu&s;t be owing to the alkali's being &s;uper&s;aturated with the creta|cious acid, in which ca&s;e, as I proved by an expe|riment made for that purpo&s;e, it may exi&s;t in a con&s;iderable quantity in a water, without chang|ing vegetable blues.</P>
<P>VII. A SLIGHT <HI>impregnation of</HI> SULPHUR, thereby darkening the nitrated &s;ilver; this is what might rea&s;onably be expected, as within about four miles there is a proper &s;trong &s;cented &s;ulphu|rious &s;pring.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="026149_0022_0FCF55EF8EAB5730">
THE la&s;t mentioned experiment, on the waters, previous to ebulition, (&s;ee p. 20.) proves, by the precipitate's not appearing granulated, that vitri|olic acid does not exi&s;t in the&s;e waters, either in a &s;imple or combined &s;tate.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ence of an uncombined alkali, (if we may &s;till be permitted to call aerated alkali's &s;o) as proved, by the boiled water's rendering infu|&s;ion of lark-&s;pur green, clearly proves the non-exi&s;tence of any earthy or metallic &s;alts in this water; &s;ince the alkali, from its &s;uperior attrac|tion to acids, mu&s;t entirely prevent their forma|tion.</P>
<P>FROM the above effects of reagents, it appears, that <HI>the waters contain</HI>

<HEAD>IV. DISTILLATION.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the experiments of Bergman, it appears that water is capable of ab&s;orbing about equal its bulk of cretacious acid, at the temperature of 55&deg;, and proportionably le&s;s as its temperature is increa&s;ed. Now, as before ob&s;erved, the bubbles of this acid, are continually pa&s;&s;ing through the waters, under examination, it is therefore clear that they mu&s;t be fully &s;aturated with it, and as their temperature is higher than that at which wa|ter will retain its equal bulk, we are obliged to conclude, that it does not contain quite &s;o much; but from the following experiment I doubt whe|ther it lacks much of it.</P>
<P>BY the means of a florence fla&s;k, with a &s;yphon properly affixed to it and the application of heat, I collected, from a given quantity of this water, in a gla&s;s ve&s;&s;el that had been previou&s;ly filled with, and inverted in hot water, upwards of its bulk of aerial fluid, the greater part of which I take to be the abovementioned acid; the re&s;t, perhaps, partly atmo&s;pheric mephites, and partly vital air. That the water contains this la&s;t, is proved, by its depo&s;iting an ochery &s;ub&s;tance, after having &s;ome green vitriol di&s;&s;olved in it, in a well corked viol.</P>

<P>AFTER evaporating ten pounds of the water of the rock, in gla&s;s ve&s;&s;els, by the heat of a <HI>water bath,</HI> I obtained a browni&s;h coloured re&s;idue, which when dried, weighed 6 drachms, 2 &s;cruples, 3 grains; this re&s;idum was put into four times its weight of <HI>&s;pirits of wine,</HI> and after &s;tanding a con&s;iderable time, being frequently agitated; was filtered and dried, and was found to have lo&s;t about 17 grs. which proved to be common &s;alt; for by evaporating the &s;pirits, I obtained it in regular <HI>cubic chry&s;tals.</HI> This circum&s;tance of &s;pirits of wine di&s;&s;olving a portion of marine &s;alt, I take to be owing to its not being &s;o highly rec|tified, as it ought to be: for when perfectly pure, it will only take up &s;alited lime, and &s;alited mag|ne&s;ia, nitrated lime, and nitrated magne&s;ia, and &s;a|lited terra pondero&s;a; but when &s;ome what diluted, it will, be&s;ide the&s;e &s;alts, al&s;o take up others: but, however, as by evaporation I obtained nothing but cubic chry&s;tals, I now conclude, po&s;itively, what in fact was before proved by reagents, that there are none of the above mentioned earthy &s;alts in the&s;e waters.</P>
<P>I now immer&s;ed the re&s;idum in 8 oz. of <HI>cold di&s;tilled water,</HI> which, after remaining &s;everal hours, and being frequently agitated, was filter|ed; the in&s;oluble re&s;idue being dried and weigh|ed,

was found to have lo&s;t, 3 drachms, 2 grains; this watery &s;olution, by turning the infu&s;ion of lark&s;pur green, is proved to contain an uncom|bined alkali. Experiments before made, &s;hew that the&s;e waters contain the muriatic acid, and as the mutual attraction, between an acid and an alkali, will not permit them to remain in compa|ny with each other, particularly when &s;urrounded by their conjuctive agent, water: without unit|ing, therefore, we mu&s;t again &s;uppo&s;e this acid to be in combination, and indeed its not rendering the infu&s;ion of lark&s;pur red, decidedly forbids any other conclu&s;ion.</P>

<P>THE remaining 3 drachms, I &s;cruple, 4 grains, I expo&s;ed to the &s;un, for &s;everal weeks, moi&s;ten|ing it frequently with rain water; this was done, in order to ru&s;t the iron, &s;o as to make it in&s;olu|ble in <HI>di&s;tilled vinegar;</HI> in which this re&s;idue was afterwards dige&s;ted and filtered.

<HEAD>A CONJECTURE UPON THE MANNER OF THE NATURAL FORMATION OF THESE WATERS.</HEAD>
<P>THE manner by which the&s;e waters become charged with their iron, lime, &s;alt, and alkali, hardly needs an explanation; as all the&s;e &s;ub&s;tan|ces exi&s;t ready formed in the bowels of the earth; and water after being aerated cannot pa&s;s over them without taking up a part; but the manner in which it gains this aerial impregnation, as the cretacious acid does not naturally exi&s;t in an un|combined &s;tate in the earth; is not &s;o ea&s;ily ac|counted for.</P>
<P>THE cretacious acid is extricated from its com|binations in the large way, by three different pro|ce&s;&s;es, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> by <HI>fermentation,</HI> by the action of a <HI>&s;tronger acid,</HI> and by <HI>heat;</HI> the fir&s;t method can|not operate in this in&s;tance, the &s;econd may have its effects; let us try how far it will explain the &s;ubject in que&s;tion. Suppo&s;e this water fir&s;t con|taining a marine acid, &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed over a quantity of cretacious alkali; here the acid con|tained in ten pounds of it, would unite with 73 grs. of pure alkali, which contained, and accord|ingly will di&s;charge 58grs. equal 116 &s;quare inches of
<PB N="37" REF="026149_0035_0FCF5603850AB1F8">
this acid. Now the water is &s;uppo&s;ed to contain at lea&s;t 200 inches, hence we &s;ee that the mo&s;t favo|rable &s;tatement of this mode, will not account e|ven for the quantity of air actually exi&s;ting as a component part of the water; much le&s;s for the great &s;uperabundance which is continually bub|bling up through it, and is di&s;charged. We can|not &s;uppo&s;e that the vitriolic acid, might act on calcarious earth, and di&s;charge this air, whereby the water might become impregnated, before it was charged with &s;ea-&s;alt and alkali; or el&s;e we &s;hould have detected &s;ome glaubers &s;alt in the waters, as they would at the time that they re|ceived their air, al&s;o unavoidably become &s;atur|ated with gyp&s;um, which when it came in contact with the alkali would have been decompo&s;ed thereby, and form this &s;alt.</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t therefore conclude, that this air mu&s;t be produced by <HI>&s;ubterranean heat,</HI> acting on cal|carious earth or lime&s;tone; thereby &s;etting it at liberty in this great profu&s;ion; indeed the deep caverns opening on the lime &s;tone bank before-mentioned, gives &s;ome plau&s;ibility to this opini|on, for it clearly evinces that &s;ome con&s;iderable operations mu&s;t be going forward in the earth be|low: the only objection that can be rai&s;ed again&s;t this conjecture is, the coldne&s;s of the waters, but this may be obviated by con&s;idering, that even if they do not come any great di&s;tance after their ae|rial impregnation; yet they may have afterwards met with their &s;alts, which as is the ca&s;e with all &s;ub&s;tances going from the &s;olid to the fluid &s;tate,
<PB N="38" REF="026149_0036_0FCF5605D1179858">
will ab&s;orb a con&s;iderable quantity of heat, dur|ing their di&s;&s;olution, and thereby produce the coldne&s;s in que&s;tion: &s;hould any &s;uppo&s;e that this cau&s;e is not adequate to the production of the coldne&s;s of the&s;e waters, they are at liberty to con&s;ider them as being aerated at a greater di&s;tance from the &s;prings than is &s;ugge&s;ted; my above ob|&s;ervations however will not permit them to &s;u&s;|pect but that the air they contain mu&s;t have been e|volved from its combination by &s;ubterranean fire, the which is proved, by the heat of the waters of Lebanon, to exi&s;t at no great di&s;tance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">About 5<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> miles.</NOTE> from the&s;e &s;prings.</P>
<P>By the waters running over a bed of &s;ulphur, their alkali may form a hepar with this mineral; the gas di&s;charged from which, may give them their &s;ulphurious impregnation.</P>

<HEAD>A METHOD OF MAKING AN ARTIFICIAL MINERAL WATER, RESEMBLING IN EVERY RESPECT THAT OF SARATOGA.</HEAD>
<P>ONE great advantage re&s;ulting from the Analy|&s;is of mineral waters is, the being enabled thereby to make artificial waters &s;imilar to them, whence all their virtues may be obtained at plea&s;ure; and at any place, without the inconvenience or ex|pence of attending at the &s;prings.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;ome mineral waters, that from the fixed nature of their ingredients, may be kept for a con&s;iderable time and tran&s;ported from place to place without &s;uffering much, if any, alteration in their natures; as for in&s;tance tho&s;e of Ep&s;om,

Richmond, Swan&s;ey, and the like; while others as tho&s;e of Pyrmont, Selt&s;er, Saratoga, &amp;c, not|with&s;tanding our greate&s;t care, can be kept but a &s;hort time and con&s;equently cannot be conveyed to any great di&s;tance, without loo&s;ing in a con&s;id|erable degree their medicinal qualities; for be|&s;ides the cretacious acid which from its volatile nature flies off, the iron that was kept in &s;olution thereby, is al&s;o depo&s;ited; hence they mu&s;t loo&s;e the two mo&s;t active and e&s;&s;ential parts of their com|po&s;ition; therefore if any one would have the&s;e waters at a di&s;tance from the &s;prings, it is art a|lone that can &s;upply him.</P>
<P>THE manner in which I prepared a water re|&s;embling the Saratoga waters, not being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Nooth's apparatus, was as follows: To a quart of &s;imple water, I added 38grs. aerated lime or chalk, 34.6 grs. common &s;alt, and 5.2 aerated mi|neral alkali; being ju&s;t the proportion that I ob|tained from a quart of the mineral water; I al&s;o &s;u&s;pended in it &s;ome fre&s;h iron filings tied up in a linen rag, then by means of a bottle with a &s;y|phon affixed to it, and which al&s;o had a mouth whereby I could put in my ingredients, I cau&s;ed the air that was di&s;charged from chalk by a dilut|ed vitriolic acid, to pa&s;s through the water above|mentioned, till it appeared to be fully &s;aturated: to this water was then added &s;ome coar&s;ely pow|dered &s;ulphur, which after &s;tanding awhile was decanted off.</P>
<P>THIS liquor was now acknowledged by &s;everal
<PB N="40" REF="026149_0038_0FCF560691CD30A0">
per&s;ons who had drank of the Saratoga waters perfectly to re&s;emble them in ta&s;te.</P>
<P>MOST of the reagents u&s;ed on the natural waters, were repeated on the&s;e and with like effects; here then is a clear proof of the &s;ucce&s;s of the analy&s;is, for &s;ynthe&s;is or the recompo&s;ition of a &s;ub&s;tance, with &s;imilar ingredients to what were obtained from it, by all chemi&s;ts is con&s;idered the &s;ure&s;t e|vidence of the truth of an analy&s;is.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING I have not had an opportu|nity of trying the effects of this water in di&s;ea&s;es, yet the above circum&s;tances proving it to be com|po&s;ed of the &s;ame ingredients as the natural wa|ters; leaves no doubt, but that it mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame medicinal virtues.</P>
