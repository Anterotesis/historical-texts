<SALUTE>DEAR MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I PROMISED I would write you all the oc|currencies in our journey; thus far, I hope, I have fulfilled it. This morning, as it would be but little out of our way to BATH, we called to &s;ee <HI>SAINT ROZO VILLOZO!</HI> the mo&s;t celebrated Per&s;onage in this part of the country. As your life has been di&s;tingui&s;hed by uniform attach|ment to &s;teady principles, adopted from inve&s;tiga|tion, &s;trengthened by practice, confirmed and ap|proved
<PB N="4" REF="023501_0004_0FBFD9FD8929DEF8">
by rea&s;on and religion; and as I really be|lieve your judgment will ever prevent you from be|coming an enthu&s;ie&s;t; &s;o, I as &s;incerely believe, your faith will not permit you to be a &s;ceptic&mdash;I &s;hall relate to you the hi&s;tory of <HI>Saint Rozo Villozo,</HI> with as much accuracy as may be in my power.</P>
<P>THIS young girl, of &s;eventeen years of age, of hone&s;t and di&s;creet parents, who live at pre&s;ent, and have done for the&s;e many years pa&s;t, near <HI>Sharpsburg,</HI> was &s;ome time &s;ince alarmed about the &s;alvation of her &s;oul, by the influence of a &s;ermon &s;he heard from a <HI>Methodi&s;t Preacher.</HI> At this time &s;he was u&s;ual good health. The impre&s;&s;ions &s;he received were deep and powerful; her affections were engaged; her heart was warmed; and her imagination extremely elevated. <HI>Je&s;us</HI> was the
<PB N="5" REF="023501_0005_0FBFDA0334A95E78">
theme of her &s;ong&mdash;That a Saviour, the Son of GOD, &s;hould conde&s;cend to come into the world, arrayed with heavenly maje&s;ty, and &s;uffer the death at the cro&s;s for man, who had tendered him&s;elf un|worthy any favors, was an idea &s;o &s;ublime, it never entered her mind&mdash;but tears flowed down her cheeks. Her conver&s;ation at different times was often interrupted by an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> more pow|erfully expre&s;sive than the de&s;cription of language. The impre&s;&s;ions on her mind were &s;oon vi&s;ible in her counten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e, by a fixed and &s;ettled melancholy. A dejection of &s;pirits&mdash;lo&s;s of appetite&mdash;decline of health&mdash;&s;trong propensity for retirement&mdash;and, when in company, an aver&s;ion to &s;peech, with that &s;olemn &s;ilence which marks grief too deeply fixed to be removed by utterance; &s;he often found a tempo|rary
<PB N="6" REF="023501_0006_0FBFDA051000C188">
relief in prayer; in offering up her heart to that GOD who is ever pre&s;ent, and ever ready to help. The &s;ublimity of who&s;e attributes, when they fir&s;t entered her feeble mind, unaccu&s;tomed to thought or reflection, &s;truck her with a&s;toni&s;hment. A gene|ral debility &s;oon prevailed over her body. For the&s;e &s;ome months pa&s;t &s;he has, occa&s;ionally, been confined to her bed. Her diet is extremely light, and con&s;i&s;sts mo&s;tly of fruit. During the whole of her indi&s;po&s;ition, once in twenty-four hours, at a particular period, all the functions of the body cea&s;e to perform their office. Life appears &s;u&s;pended. During this interim, after &s;he has recovered, &s;he declares with the mo&s;t &s;olemn a&s;surances, and ma|ny mo&s;t &s;incerely believe her, that &s;he has been to Heaven&mdash;&s;een Chri&s;t&mdash;and partook of the plea&s;ures,
<PB N="7" REF="023501_0007_0FBFDA06D06357D0">
and enjoyed the company of Angels&mdash;with a great many other wild, incoherent and unconnected de|ceptions.</P>
<P>MANY thou&s;ands of idle and curious people, from different parts of the country, have could to &s;ee, hear, and que&s;tion, to look and wonder, and wonder and look&mdash;and, if po&s;&s;ible, to obtain &s;ome information how their affairs and concerns may &s;tand in the other world; which; a little previous enquiry into their own hearts and actions, conduct and characters, would have a&s;certained with more accuracy than phantom &s;pirits; or <HI>Saint Rozo Villozo,</HI> pa&s;sing and repa&s;sing from this world to the other.</P>
<P>THE Methodi&s;ts have been guilty of extravagan|cies and follies, but they will never attempt, I am confident, to procure converts at the expence of
<PB N="8" REF="023501_0008_0FBFDA0E08997E08">
their reputation, by artifice, deceit, and impo&s;ition. They have been guilty&mdash;and it is a melancholy truth, which good people mu&s;t lament&mdash;of rou&s;ing and alarming the pa&s;sions, without informing the under&s;tanding&mdash;of &s;cattering fire without communi|cating in&s;truction&mdash;of emiting a vapour, highly &s;ul|phurous, the &s;mell of which was alone &s;ufficient to bewilder the ignorant, without di&s;covering proper rights to direct them. And I am &s;orry to ob&s;erve, &s;ome have been &s;ent out among their preachers, who&s;e morals and manners have been exceptiona|ble, and who&s;e highe&s;t characteri&s;tic was their ig|norance, to perform the great office of unfolding the &s;criptures, to a people who really &s;tood in need of it, and who would gladly have received in&s;truction, if their teachers had been competent to &s;o impor|tant
<PB N="9" REF="023501_0009_0FBFDA11A3D45148">
a tru&s;t. But the Methodi&s;t church, like a huge &s;tructure, built in a hurry, of combu&s;table ma|terials, without its proper foundation, (religious knowledge and learned men) will fall, as &s;oon as the pa&s;sions of its votaries &s;ub&s;ide; and this im|portant truth will be illu&s;trated to the world, whether a fermentation in the minds of the people, and a change in their &s;entiments, in exterior garb and profe&s;sions, is, ultimately, favourable to the improvement of manners and morals, to &s;ocial hap|pine&s;s, to true and genuine religion.</P>
<P>THAT there is any impo&s;ition kept up upon a pre|mediated plan, formed by any &s;ect of people to im|po&s;e upon the public, the &s;implicity of the parents, and the &s;implicity of the daughter, together with the impracticability of &s;upporting of it, for any
<PB N="10" REF="023501_0010_0FBFDA1358AE4490">
length of time, with any degree of &s;ucce&s;s, in this enlightened age, a moment's reflection precludes the po&s;sibility of a doubts&mdash;and a few facts will &s;hew the grounds on which the idea of a premeditated impo&s;ition ought not to be indulged.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. A derangement of nerves will produce a de|rangement of ideas, infinitely varying.</P>
<P N="2">2d. WHEN the mind has been exerci&s;ed by any of the more violent pa&s;sions of fear, joy, anger, it in|clines, in proportion as it has been agitated, to in|action, to langour, to melancholy; and there it re|mains, unle&s;s rou&s;ed by introducing &s;ome new ob|ject, and putting it under the impul&s;e of &s;ome new pa&s;sion.</P>
<P N="3">3d. HAD &s;he have received proper information, after the fir&s;t impul&s;e of feeling was over, and her
<PB N="11" REF="023501_0011_0FBFDA14CAA49048">
fears and terrors had &s;ub&s;ided, in&s;tead of being gloomy and melancholy, her thoughts would have found agreeable employment in &s;earching out the great truths of religion, and her whole attention would have been occupied in extending their influ|ence upon her life and actions.</P>
<P N="4">4th. AGREERABLE employment of thought or ac|tion, of the acqui&s;ition of knowledge or property, bani&s;hes dejection and melancholy.</P>
<P N="5">5th. THE di&s;covery of religious truth mu&s;t have as much happier influence on the mind, than any other, as it is &s;uperior.</P>
<P N="6">6th. VANITY is a univer&s;al feeling, it has oc|cupied every human heart, and every character, in every &s;ituation; and when the opportunity offers for indulging of it, the impul&s;e is too &s;trong to be
<PB N="12" REF="023501_0012_0FBFDA1D2D3FD8D8">
re&s;trained. What at fir&s;t might have originated in mere accident, is confirmend into a habit, and &s;o long as it can be fed by the admiration of the cre|dulous, there is no danger but the love of being con&s;picous, in daughter and parents, if it &s;hould not induce them to encourage, will, at lea&s;t make them cautions how they remove a di&s;order, which has &s;upported, thus far, the delu&s;ion.</P>
<P>WHEN the laws which controul the connection of &s;oul and body, are, periodically, once in twenty-four hours, mechanically &s;u&s;pended, a phenome|non is exhibited which &s;eldom occurs. And when the &s;oul, the invi&s;ible principle of life and motion, pa&s;ses out and into the body, and it receives no in|jury, if true, is not ea&s;ily to be accounted for. But when a certain debility of con&s;titution mu&s;t be a
<PB N="13" REF="023501_0013_0FBFDA1E95F12830">
nece&s;sary preparation for the di&s;play of the&s;e <HI>won|derful things,</HI> the my&s;tery unravels it&s;elf, and the mo&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;tic minds would give up their impli|cit belief, if they would only take time to delibe|rate.</P>
<P>CREDULITY and ignorance have, in every &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">age of &s;ociety, accompanied each other. The privi|lege of examining and inve&s;tigating upon rational principles, the different occurencies of the day, in the moral and natural world, is confined to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> nor do they alwsys u&s;e it without abu&s;e. If a pup|pet dancer, or merry Andrew can command atten|tion, one who&s;e exhibitions are behind the curtain which bounds human intelligence, the characters introduced not familiar to the conceptions of the wi&s;e&s;t, the greate&s;t, and the be&s;t of men, the de&s;crip|tions
<PB N="14" REF="023501_0014_0FBFDA202517DD68">
given especially coming under the garb of religion mu&s;t command the belief of that large proportion of mankind, who&s;e ignorance prevents them from examining, and who&s;e credulity makes it unnece&s;sary. If when the novelty becomes more familiar, the admiration of the credulous &s;tage for want of fre&s;h matter to keep it up, when the air of the approaching &s;ea&s;on, by bracing up relaxed nerves, produces a change in the con&s;titution;&mdash;when in &s;hort &s;he arrives at her u&s;ual good health&mdash;the delu&s;ion di&s;appears&mdash;her friends will be di&s;|appointed to have their SAINT remain with them, without any material change for the better, in worldly or heavenly circum&s;tances&mdash;and <HI>ROZO VILLOZO</HI> her&s;elf obliged to return to her for|mer cour&s;e of life&mdash;the ignorant will wonder;&mdash;
<PB N="15" REF="023501_0015_0FBFDA27893A9450">
and not &s;ingle per&s;on bene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ed, but injured, by &s;o glaring a &s;pectacle of folly and impo&s;ition.</P>
