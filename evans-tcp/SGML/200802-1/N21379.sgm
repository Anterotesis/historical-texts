<HEAD>THE CHARACTER, PREACHING, &amp;c. OF THE REVEREND Mr. GEORGE WHITEFIELD, Impartially repre&s;ented and &s;upported, in a SERMON, preached in Charle&s;ton, South-Carolina, March 26th, Anno Domini, 1740, by JOSEPH SMITH, V. D. M. With a Preface by the Rev. Dr. COLMAN, and Mr. COOPER, of Bo&s;ton, New-England.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="to the reader">
<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE following di&s;cour&s;e was inclo&s;ed to us by our dear brother, the worthy author of it; and we have read it with high plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction. The de&s;ign is &s;ufficiently intimated in the title page. It is indeed a &s;ermon of an extraordinary nature. To give from the pulpit, the per&s;onal and mini&s;terial character of a living preacher is very unu&s;ual, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, perhaps altogether new. But &s;o is the occa&s;ion&mdash;And the di&s;cour&s;e mu&s;t be looked upon to be apologetical rather <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> encomia&s;tic. The manife&s;t de&s;ign is to &s;upport the cau&s;e by vindicating the man; not a private and party cau&s;e; but that of primitive piety, and Catholic Chri&s;tianity; the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t and truth, if the peculiar doctrines of the go&s;pel, the a&s;&s;erting and clearing whereof, was the glory of the Reformation, may be &s;o called? A cau&s;e this, in which zeal is certainly a virtue.</P>
<P>As to the Rev. Mr. Whitefield, the per&s;on referred to, and named, he is the wonder of the age; and no
<PB N="6" REF="028079_0005_0FD69344D19AC660">
man more employs the pens, and fills up the conver|&s;ation of people, than he does at this day: none more admired and applauded by &s;ome, contemned and reproached by others. The common lot of the mo&s;t excellent men the world has ever had to &s;hew!</P>
<P>While &s;o many others are &s;peaking and publi&s;hing their &s;entiments concerning him with all freedom, Mr. Smith thought him&s;elf not precluded. He hath had as much opportunity as mo&s;t, to inform him&s;elf concerning Mr. Whitefield's doctrine, manner of life, purpo&s;e, faith, charity, long-&s;uffering, patience, per&s;ecutions, and afflictions which have come unto him: and what he has &s;een and heard, that declares he unto us: and we receive his te&s;timony, becau&s;e we know him to be a gentleman of good &s;en&s;e and &s;trict veracity; and al&s;o free from enthu&s;ia&s;tic im|pre&s;&s;ions, unle&s;s &s;erious religion and experimental piety are &s;o called, as we have melancholy occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve they often are. There appear to us plain marks of &s;incerity and impartiality in the following account. And the &s;ame things have been reported to us by our Reverend brethren, of the like character, whom we know and corre&s;pond with, in places where Mr. Whitefield hath vi&s;ited and preached in.</P>
<P>And as to his thoughts re&s;pecting the views of providence in rai&s;ing up men of this &s;tamp and &s;pirit in our day, he expre&s;&s;es them with great mode&s;ty and caution, and we cannot but apprehend they are coun|tenanced from &s;cripture, rea&s;on, and ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>When God is about to carry on &s;alvation-work with any remarkable &s;ucce&s;s, he will rai&s;e up &s;uitable in&s;truments to work by. He will form and &s;pirit men for great and extraordinary undertakings when he has any great and extraordinary purpo&s;es to &s;erve.</P>
<P>Thus when God's time for the great and good work of building the &s;econd temple was come, Jo|&s;hua
<PB N="7" REF="028079_0006_0FD69345E2B669E0">
and others were animated to undertake it; and though they were men wondered at, for the warmth of their zeal and the boldne&s;s of their enterprize; that in the face of &s;o many oppo&s;ers and difficulties they &s;hould undertake to rebuild the holy city and the tem|ple; yet they were rai&s;ed above all di&s;couragements, and &s;tood firm again&s;t all oppo&s;ition, being fortified with a &s;pecial promi&s;e of the Me&s;&s;iah, in who&s;e &s;trength and by who&s;e influence they &s;hould be &s;uc|ce&s;sfully carried on in their work. <Q>Hear now, O Jo&s;hua the high-prie&s;t, Thou and thy fellows that &s;it before thee; for they are men wondered at: for I will bring forth my &s;ervant the branch. Be|hold, the &s;tone that I have laid before Jo&s;hua: Up|on one &s;tone &s;hall be &s;even eyes. I will engrave the engraving thereof, &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts; and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.</Q> Zech. ii. 8, 9.</P>
<P>So when the go&s;pel-church was to be &s;et up in the world, and the Gentile nations to be converted to the knowledge and faith of Je&s;us, a dozen poor illi|terate fi&s;hermen were endued with power from on high; and &s;ent forth to open men's eyes, to turn them from darkne&s;s to light, and from the power of Satan to God. And in them was fulfilled that which is written, P&s;alm viii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. <Q>Out of the mouth of babes and &s;ucklings ha&s;t thou ordained &s;trength, becau&s;e of thine enemies; that thou mighte&s;t &s;till the enemy and the avenger.</Q></P>
<P>And when the church was over&s;pread with Popi&s;h darkne&s;s, &s;uper&s;tition, and idolatry, and the Romi&s;h tyranny was at its very height<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the 16th century.</NOTE>, it plea&s;ed God to en|lighten &s;ome eccle&s;ia&s;tics gradually in the knowledge of his truth, and then animate and a&s;&s;i&s;t them to lay open the errors and corruptions of Popery, and bold|ly
<PB N="8" REF="028079_0007_0FD6934752C680D8">
to a&s;&s;ert and maintain the pure truths of the go&s;pel. Of this number were Zuinglius in Switzerland, and Luther in Germany; names that will be had in ever|la&s;ting remembrance in the records of the church.</P>
<P>The re&s;olute oppo&s;ition that was made again&s;t them, and the contempt that was poured upon them, in&s;tead of cooling, inflamed their courage. The further &s;earch they made into the depth of tho&s;e cor|ruptions that had over&s;pread the church, the more light &s;till broke in upon them. They found its doc|trines poi&s;oned with here&s;y, and its wor&s;hip corrupted with &s;uper&s;tition and idolatry; and Chri&s;tianity grown very like to Pagani&s;m. Under this conviction they loudly called upon all that had any concern for their &s;ouls to go out of Babylon, as they would not be partakers of her plagues. And multitudes of people were influenced by their preaching and writings, to renounce the Romi&s;h doctrines and &s;uper&s;tition; and many of the princes of Europe were inclined to fa|vour and fall in with the Reformation.</P>
<P>As for Luther in particular, he was a wondrous man, and the almighty power of God was eminently manife&s;ted in him. When he fir&s;t appeared, <Q>What could be expected from a poor friar, creeping out of a cloi&s;ter? He was advi&s;ed by his friends to get into his cell again, and to ply his prayers, and not venture upon &s;o hazardous an undertaking, as to preach again&s;t the Pope, or attempt &s;o impo&s;&s;i|ble a work as the reformation. But not by might, nor power but by my Spirit, &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts.</Q>&mdash;This &s;ingle incon&s;iderable man was more than a match for the powers of Rome, and was in|&s;trumental to produce one of the greate&s;t changes the world has ever had to marvel at.</P>
<P>And when it plea&s;es God to renew the face of reli|gion; when primitive Chri&s;tianity, and the power of
<PB N="9" REF="028079_0008_0FD69348DAD1EFB0">
godline&s;s, &s;hall be revived in the reforming churches; when the profe&s;&s;ors of the go&s;pel &s;hall be recovered from the fal&s;e principles they have embraced, rai&s;ed above tho&s;e dead formalities they have &s;o long re&s;ted in, and awakened out of that lethargy they are fallen into; when the&s;e expected times of reformation &s;hall come on, is it not rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that God will rai&s;e up tho&s;e to effect it, whom he will furni&s;h with a good mea&s;ure of the primitive apo&s;tolic &s;pirit; who&s;e hearts &s;hall be inflamed with a burning zeal for the honour of the Redeemer, and love to the &s;ouls of men; and who &s;hall therefore be willing to deny them&s;elves in the&s;e things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> are dear to the mo&s;t; &s;hall not &s;cruple to go out of the common road to &s;pread the triumphs of the go&s;pel, and fetch in &s;ouls to Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and will not be di&s;couraged by any oppo&s;ition they may meet with? Con&s;idering the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things in the Chri&s;tian world, how can we expect any great change for the better, but in a way that &s;hall be extraordinary.</P>
<P>And if there is any appearance of &s;uch a work at any time, or in any place, &s;urely we &s;hould take care not to &s;light and undervalue it; much le&s;s &s;hould we reproach and cen&s;ure it, or tho&s;e who are u&s;ed as in|&s;truments in it, &s;o far as it &s;eems to be from heaven, and further it with our prayers, as tho&s;e who are waiting for the kingdom of God.</P>
<P>We would therefore be&s;peak the prayers of the faithful in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, into who&s;e hands the&s;e pa|pers may come, both for our dear brother and the author of this di&s;cour&s;e; who is with great zeal con|tending for &s;ome important points of the faith once delivered unto the &s;aints, again&s;t &s;ome who openly oppo&s;e them, and labouring to promote practical godline&s;s, in the place where divine providence has appointed his pre&s;ent &s;tation; that he may be a&s;&s;i&s;ted
<PB N="10" REF="028079_0009_0FD6934A4BBBC0F0">
and &s;ucceeded in all his faithful &s;ervices for the Re|deemer's kingdom; and al&s;o for the Rev. Mr. Whitefield, that he may, (as he has well expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in &s;ome of his letters to us) <Q>be kept hum|ble and dependent on our dear Lord Je&s;us;</Q> be pre&s;erved in his travels, &s;trengthened to his uncom|mon labours, and fortified again&s;t all oppo&s;ition: that Satan, (who cannot but have a peculiar enmity at tho&s;e who &s;o &s;et them&s;elves again&s;t his kingdom) may never get advantage of him, to the blemi&s;h or hind|rance of the great and good work which we hope is begun and going on; that God will cau&s;e him always to triumph in Chri&s;t, while he makes manife&s;t the favour of his knowledge by him in every place, and u&s;es him as an in&s;trument to bring back many wan|dering &s;heep to the Shepherd and Bi&s;hop of their &s;ouls; and very particularly that his purpo&s;ed coming to us, may be with as full a ble&s;&s;ing of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t as other places have experienced, and much more abundant by the will and grace of our God!</P>

<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> To give my thoughts, what Providence &s;eems <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o have in its view in rai&s;ing up men of this &s;tamp in our day, almo&s;t every where &s;poken again&s;t, yet crowded after and ju&s;tly admired.</P>
<P>I. I &s;hall give you my opinions of the doctrines he in&s;i&s;ted upon among us.</P>
<P>To &s;peak more generally, They were doctrines, I am of opinion agreeable to the dictates of rea&s;on; evidently founded upon &s;cripture; exactly corre|&s;pondent with the articles of the e&s;tabli&s;hment; of great u&s;e and nece&s;&s;ity in forming the Chri&s;tian life; which I had early imbibed from the be&s;t writers and &s;y&s;tems; from which I had never yet &s;een rea&s;on to recede, and which therefore you are witne&s;&s;es, I have not failed to introduce and inculcate, in the cour&s;e of my mini&s;try among you.</P>
<P>To be more particular;</P>
<P>One of the doctrines, which he has hardly pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence in any &s;ingle di&s;cour&s;e, is that of ori|ginal &s;in. A truth &s;o manife&s;t in &s;cripture, that I am almo&s;t of opinion, it is impo&s;&s;ible any &s;incere, di|ligent and unprejudiced inquirer &s;hould mi&s;s it: for it is written in &s;un-beams that a man may run and read.</P>
<P>By original &s;in I mean nothing le&s;s than the impu|tation of Adam's fir&s;t &s;in to all his po&s;terity by ordinary generation; which imputation is the re|&s;ultance of his being con&s;tituted to act for them in the exten&s;ive capacity of a legal repre&s;entative; the con&s;equence of which is, that inherent corruption of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and tho&s;e &s;inful propen&s;ities, we are now born <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> into the world.&mdash;As to the point of
<PB N="13" REF="028079_0012_0FD69353AD57F0D0">
imputation, it is a doctrine, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, of more intricacy; about which, it is therefore po&s;&s;ible, a well meaning man may labour under &s;ome &s;cru|ples, while perhaps he allows of the depravity of human nature. Though I mu&s;t beg leave to expre&s;s my &s;urpri&s;e, that any per&s;on of judgment &s;hould main|tain this depravity, and not immediately di&s;cover its nece&s;&s;ary connection with the imputation, and how impo&s;&s;ible it is to &s;ecure the ju&s;tice of God, without having recour&s;e to it: for certainly the corruption of human nature, &s;o univer&s;al and in&s;eparable, is one of the greate&s;t puni&s;hments that could be inflicted upon the &s;pecies; and that it is inflicted, appears from hence, that <HI>God made man at fir&s;t upright.</HI> Now, if there be no previous imputation, to lay a legal foundation for this puni&s;hment, then God has inflicted an evident puni&s;hment upon a race of men, perfectly innocent, and which had neither &s;inned per&s;onally, nor yet by imputation; and thus, while we imagine we honour the ju&s;tice of God by renounc|ing imputation, we in fact pour the highe&s;t di&s;hon|our upon that &s;acred attribute&mdash;This, I fear, is the grand rea&s;on, why the adver&s;aries of original &s;in la|bour &s;o hard to explode the depravity of nature; for &s;hould they once admit that, they are con&s;cious they mu&s;t admit imputation too. I &s;ay, I fear this is the grand rea&s;on.&mdash;How el&s;e is it po&s;&s;ible a man &s;hould que&s;tion a truth, written in capitals upon the moral world? A truth, we feel in every power of our &s;oul! what we read upon our own hearts; and is indeed &s;tamped upon univer&s;al nature, within our horizon; and which the more righteous any man is, the more he feels and groans under.&mdash;We need not wonder then, our late incomparable preacher &s;hould in&s;i&s;t upon original &s;in, when we con&s;ider, not only in what an inconte&s;tible manner he proved it, but of

what va&s;t importance it mu&s;t be. For to give my opinion freely; I cannot think, I can &s;ee, how the Chri&s;tian &s;cheme can be con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf, or &s;up|ported with honour, without this ba&s;is. I look upon it, not merely as a doctrine of the &s;criptures, the great fountain of truth, but a very fundamental one; from which, I hope, God will &s;uffer none of you to be en|ticed, by any &s;ophi&s;try of the &s;ubtle di&s;puters of this world, or charms of language.</P>
<P>But to proceed.&mdash;</P>
<P>Another doctrine we have lately had in the warm|e&s;t language impre&s;&s;ed upon us, is that Pauline one of ju&s;tification by faith alone. And here you will re|member, how the preacher vindicated him&s;elf from all &s;u&s;picions of Antinomian error, and opening a door to licentious manners: for while on the one hand, he earne&s;tly contended for our ju&s;tification as the free gift of God, by faith alone, in the blood of Chri&s;t, an article of faith delivered to the &s;aints of old; &s;o on the other hand, he took &s;pecial care to guard again&s;t the licentious abu&s;e of it, and would not make void the law, when he a&s;&s;erted that good works were the nece&s;&s;ary fruits and evidences of true faith; telling us plainly, and with the cleare&s;t di&s;tinction, that a man was ju&s;tified the&s;e three ways; meritori|ou&s;ly by Chri&s;t, in&s;trumentally by faith alone, decla|ratively by good works. And believe me, my bre|thren, this is the true go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the writings of the apo&s;tles. For when Abraham believed God, was not it (his faith) imputed to him for righ|teou&s;ne&s;s? And yet, was not Abraham our father ju&s;tified by works, when he had offered I&s;aac his &s;on upon the altar! How &s;hall we then reconcile this? Why very ea&s;ily. The act of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ju&s;tified him through Chri&s;t, and the offering I&s;aac ju&s;tified that faith: the fir&s;t in the &s;ight of God, the other in the

&s;ight of man. In ju&s;tification faith precedes, works follow after; for if works precede, or had any ca&s;ual influence into our ju&s;tification, we might &s;eem to have whereof to glory before God. But here, it is the free gift of God, and boa&s;ting for ever excluded. God, when he ju&s;tifies a man, never finds, but makes him holy; without any previous merit, of which there can be no &s;hadow in an apo&s;tate creature. No; <HI>By grace ye are &s;aved, through faith; and that not of your&s;elves, it is the gift of God.</HI> And, could I live the mo&s;t exact life ever man lived; could I even excel the virtues of the pious preacher him&s;elf; could I pro|duce as many good works as the &s;aints in all ages collected together; I would not for ten thou&s;and worlds put my ju&s;tification upon them: I would only con&s;ider them, as bright and plea&s;ant evidences of the truth of my faith in Chri&s;t. Good works are valua|ble things; God forbid we &s;hould li&s;p a word again&s;t them, in their proper place; we plead for them, we pre&s;s the practice of them, as incumbent upon all Chri&s;tians; but we cannot allow them any &s;hare in our ju&s;tification before God. They may prove we are ju&s;tified; but they cannot ju&s;tify us. No verily: <HI>Not by works of righteou&s;ne&s;s which we have done, but of his own mercy, God &s;aveth us.</HI>&mdash;Hitherto then, our preacher is othodox in his doctrine, which both excludes licentiou&s;ne&s;s, e&s;tabli&s;hes the law, and exalts free grace; the evident de&s;ign and language of the go&s;pel, and which, I am of opinion, every mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t &s;hould earne&s;tly contend for: becau&s;e the &s;in|ner mu&s;t fir&s;t &s;ee him&s;elf naked, before he will come to Chri&s;t for his white raiment; the pure and fine linen, which is the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;aints, and which I council you all to buy of him.</P>
<P>Regeneration was another great doctrine, which the excellent man much in&s;i&s;ted upon; hardly a &s;ingle

Nor can any man be &s;urpri&s;ed, that a mini&s;ter of the New Te&s;tament &s;hould &s;o heartily e&s;pou&s;e a principle, which our Lord him&s;elf began to &s;peak, and a&s;&s;erted as a funda|mental point of Chri&s;tianity, indi&s;pen&s;ibly requi&s;ite to eternal life; and this with &s;o much vehemency, and earne&s;t repetition. <HI>Verily, verily, I &s;ay unto thee, ex|cept a man be born again (from above) he cannot &s;ee the kingdom of God.</HI> He a&s;&s;ures us, <HI>We mu&s;t be born of water and of the Spirit.</HI> Our regeneration re&s;ults in its nece&s;&s;ity, from original &s;in.

For we can only be <HI>&s;aved by the wa&s;hing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t:</HI> the infu&s;ion of a new life, a divine, heavenly and prolific principle. As we are by nature dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, God mu&s;t quicken us by his Spirit, and through that we mu&s;t <HI>mortify the deeds of the bo|dy, and crucify the fle&s;h with its lu&s;ts and affections.</HI> For until we know (until we feel the exceeding great|ne&s;s of) the power of Chri&s;t's re&s;urrection, we have no part in him: we cannot enter into heaven; or if we &s;hould, our fir&s;t petition would be, to be di&s;chaged as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. Plea&s;ure is the re&s;ult of harmony; the nature mu&s;t agree with the object: there mu&s;t be a great change upon the nature, to make us &s;u&s;ceptive of the plea&s;ures of God's pre&s;ence.&mdash;</P>

demon&s;trations in a point of pure morality. This is a doctrine, I have been acquainted with the&s;e many years; it is not new or &s;urpri&s;ing to me; you have heard me preach it &s;cores of times, though per|haps, clothed in other expre&s;&s;ions, and the influences of the Spirit, the impre&s;&s;ions of grace. And how|ever derided by &s;ome, who &s;et up and care&s;s a &s;y&s;tem of rational religion, I hope to have always enthu&s;i|a&s;m enough to maintain that the Spirit of God may be felt.&mdash;To conclude this head, all the doc|trines now mentioned, are primitive, prote&s;tant, puritanic ones; which our good fathers, conformi&s;ts and di&s;&s;enters, have filled their writings with: and as Dr. Watts has well ob&s;erved, <Q>They fill heaven apace, for God was with them.</Q></P>
<P>Yet all that va&s;t reverence, with which I heard the&s;e doctrines from the mouth of our famous preacher, could not win my applau&s;e or approbation of &s;ome few har&s;her epithets and expre&s;&s;ions (you know what I mean) which dropt from his lips.

<P>And here I need not &s;ay, nor can my pen de&s;cribe his action and ge&s;ture, in all their &s;trength and de|cencies. He is certainly a fini&s;hed preacher, and a great ma&s;ter of pulpit oratory and elocution, while a noble negligence ran thro' his &s;tyle.

<P>He appeared to me, in all his di&s;cour&s;es, very deeply affected and impre&s;&s;ed in his own heart. How did that burn and boil within him, when he &s;pake of the things he had made, touching the King? How was his tongue like the pen of a ready writer? touch|ing as with a coal from the altar! With what a flow of words, what a ready profu&s;ion of language, did he &s;peak to us upon the great concerns of our &s;ouls? In what a flaming light did he &s;et our eternity before us? how earne&s;tly did he pre&s;s Chri&s;t upon us? How did he move our pa&s;&s;ions with the con&s;training love of &s;uch a Redeemer?

while he poured in the balm upon the wounds of the contrite, and made broken bones rejoice? Eternal themes, the tremendous &s;olemnities of our religion, were all alive upon his tongue! So methinks (if you will forgive the figure) &s;aint Paul would look and &s;peak in a pulpit, and in &s;ome &s;uch manner, I have been tempted to conceive of a &s;eraph, were he &s;ent down to preach among us, and to tell us what things he had &s;een and heard above!&mdash;How bold and coura|geous did he look?

<P>You may be &s;ure I was not di&s;plea&s;ed with this part of his conduct, when I have &s;o often my&s;elf mentioned the&s;e things, as of pernicious tendency to our morals, religion, and pro&s;perity. And who can blame a mi|ni&s;ter's freedom and zeal; what hard mea&s;ures, what cruel treatment would it be to cen&s;ure our plainne&s;s of &s;peech; when our very commi&s;&s;ion requires us to lift up our voice like a trumpet, to cry aloud, and not &s;pare, to &s;hew people their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; and when the blood of your &s;ouls, the mo&s;t in&s;upportable thing in the world, mu&s;t be required at our hands, if we be afraid to warn!

<P>III. I now proceed to &s;hew my opinion of our preacher, in his <HI>per&s;onal character</HI> and <HI>behaviour.</HI></P>
<P>Here I may take courage, and challenge his wor&s;t enemies to lay any thing to the charge of his morals, or to arraign his &s;incerity, &s;o vi&s;ible in his whole deportment.</P>
<P>While he preaches up faith alone, in our ju&s;tifica|tion before God, yet he is careful to maintain good works, and denying ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, to live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly, and godly. The&s;e things the grace of God teacheth us; and how much of this doctrine has he tran&s;cribed into his life? How rich has he been in all good works? What an eminent pattern of piety towards God? How holy and un|blameable in all conver&s;ation and godline&s;s? How &s;ea&s;oned, how much to the u&s;e of edifying, all his di&s;|cour&s;es? How naturally does he turn them to reli|gion? How much is he given to meditation him&s;elf, and how does he labour to excite it in others?</P>

offered; but he abhors the &s;pirit, he endeavours to &s;uppre&s;s it. He is always careful to time his Sabbath di&s;cour&s;es, &s;o as not to interfere with the &s;tated hours of wor&s;hip, in that church, of which he is a profe&s;&s;ed member, and mini&s;ter, and in the opinion of many people a very bright ornament; becau&s;e, as he told us, he would not tempt away hearers from their pro|per and re&s;pective pa&s;tors. And is not this a noble and generous, a catholic and Chri&s;tian &s;pirit! He is not bigotted to the modalities and le&s;&s;er rites and forms of religion, while zealous enough and very warm and jealous in all its e&s;&s;entials, e&s;pecially in the divine honours and godhead of his Saviour. He pro|fe&s;&s;es love to good men of every denomination, and told us, that the <HI>kingdom of heaven con&s;i&s;ts not of meats and drinks.</HI> He appears to me a man full of the Holy Gho&s;t and of faith. Though his prayers, in this pulpit were all extempore, yet how copious, how ardent, with what compa&s;s of thought? The &s;pirit of grace and &s;upplication &s;eemed to be poured out upon him in plenty, and to kindle and animate his devotions. He prays in public, with that &s;pirit, vari|ety, and fluency which could only be expected from a man, who was no &s;tranger to the &s;acred duty in pri|vate.&mdash;He lives much by faith, and above the world: de&s;pi&s;es preferments and riches; of which la&s;t, I am told, he has had great offers in Europe&mdash;His heart &s;eems &s;et upon doing good. He goes about his great Ma&s;ter's work with diligence and application; and with &s;uch cheerfulne&s;s, as would make one in love with a life of religion, which has &s;o many inward &s;prings of the be&s;t comforts, and is not that gloomy, melancholy thing, which prejudice and imagination make it. He is proof again&s;t reproach and invective. When he is reviled, revileth not again, but prays heartily for all his enemies, and that &s;uch as oppo&s;e

I freely own he has taken my heart, and I feel his re|proaches.&mdash;God &s;eems to be with him of a truth; has &s;et his &s;eal upon him: his rod has budded, and he has many to whom he can &s;ay, <HI>Ye are my epi&s;tle.</HI> Wherever he has preached he has been thronged, and many have come to him pricked in their hearts, &s;ay|ing, <HI>What &s;hall we do to be &s;aved!</HI> He has put a new face upon religion, my letters inform me, in &s;ome populous cities and parts of our neighbouring conti|nent; given new life to mini&s;ters and people; made &s;ermons, once a drug, a vendible commodity among them; evening and weekly lectures are &s;et up, and always crowded with per&s;ons of different per&s;ua&s;ions; while he has put a damp upon their polite diver&s;ions, which always dwindle as Chri&s;tianity revives. Sure|ly, no man could do the&s;e things, I had almo&s;t &s;aid, the&s;e miracles, unle&s;s God were with him, who gives the increa&s;e, <HI>even when Paul plants, and Apollos waters.</HI> Had eccle&s;ia&s;tic preferments been his idol, fame and reputation his motive, as he has taken a prepo&s;terous way to acqiure them, &s;o I can never &s;uffer my&s;elf to think God would have owned him &s;o vi&s;i|bly, or given him &s;o many &s;eals of his mini&s;try. Our Saviour him&s;elf makes good fruits the general cha|racteri&s;tic of good mini&s;ters. <HI>Ye &s;hall know them by their fruits.</HI> Either the fruits and &s;ucce&s;s of their mi|ni&s;try, the de&s;ign and tendency of their doctrines, or the fruits of the Spirit in their lives. And which of the&s;e have been wanting in this extraordinary man? Who can object again&s;t the tendency of his doctrines? And for &s;ucce&s;s, his enemies know it to their own confu&s;ion. And who can &s;ay his life is unfruitful, or
<PB N="25" REF="028079_0024_0FD6931C1D62D3C0">
that he has appeared like an immoral man? He ren|ders to all their due. While zealous for the things of God, he is a friend to Cae&s;ar; a loyal &s;ubject to King George, heartily prays for him and his royal hou&s;e; "<HI>May it abide before God!</HI>" A prayer, to which, I doubt not&punc; you are all ready to &s;ay, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>But to proceed with our character of the preacher, whom hath he wronged or defrauded? <HI>Who&s;e ox or who&s;e a&s;s hath he taken?</HI> Say, if any man hath found ought in his hands: &s;o far from it, that he &s;eems to live, not by bread alone, but by the word and promi&s;e of God; without taking thought for the morrow, <HI>what he &s;hall eat, or drink, or put on.</HI></P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>JEREMIAH, xxiii. 6.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>The Lord our Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHOEVER is acquainted with the nature of mankind in general, or the propen&s;ity of his own heart in particular, mu&s;t acknowledge, that &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s is the la&s;t idol that is rooted out of the heart.&mdash;Being once born under a covenant of works, it is natural for us all to have recour&s;e to a covenant of works for our everla&s;ting &s;alvation. And we have contracted &s;uch a devili&s;h pride by our fall from God, that we would, if not wholly, yet in part at lea&s;t, glory in being the cau&s;e of our own &s;alvation. We cry out again&s;t Popery, and that very ju&s;tly; but we are all papi&s;ts, at lea&s;t I am &s;ure we are all Armini|ans by nature; and therefore, no wonder &s;o many natural men embrace that &s;cheme. It is true, we di&s;claim the doctrine of merit, are a&s;hamed directly to &s;ay we de&s;erve any good at the hands of God; therefore as the apo&s;tle excellently well ob&s;erves, we go about, we fetch a circuit, to e&s;tabli&s;h a righteou&s;|ne&s;s of our own, and, like the phari&s;ees of old, will not wholly &s;ubmit to that righteou&s;ne&s;s, which is of God through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</P>
<P>This is the &s;ore&s;t, though alas! the mo&s;t common
<PB N="32" REF="028079_0031_0FD6932F6CCC52A0">
evil that was ever yet &s;een under the &s;un. An evil, that in any age, e&s;pecially in the&s;e dregs of time wherein we live, cannot &s;ufficiently be inveighed again&s;t.&mdash;For as it is with the people, &s;o it is with the prie&s;ts; and it is to be feared, even in tho&s;e places where once the truth, as it is in Je&s;us, was eminently preached, many mini&s;ters are &s;o &s;adly de|generated from their pious ance&s;tors, that the doctrines of grace, e&s;pecially the per&s;onal, all-&s;ufficient righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us, is but too &s;eldom, too &s;lightly men|tioned. Hence the love of many waxeth cold; and I have often thought, was it po&s;&s;ible, that this &s;ingle con&s;ideration would be &s;ufficient to rai&s;e our venera|ble forefathers again from their graves; who would thunder in their ears their fatal error.</P>
<P>The righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t is one of tho&s;e great my&s;teries which the angels de&s;ire to <HI>look into,</HI> and &s;eems to be one of the fir&s;t le&s;&s;ons that God taught men after the fall. For what were the coats that God made to put on our fir&s;t parents, but types of the application of the merits or righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t to believer's hearts? We are told, that tho&s;e coats were made of &s;ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> of bea&s;ts, and as bea&s;ts were not then food for men, we may fairly infer, that tho&s;e bea&s;ts were &s;lai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> in &s;acrifice, in commemoration of the great &s;acrifice Je&s;us Chri&s;t thereafter to be offered. And the &s;kins of tho&s;e bea&s;ts thus &s;lain, being put on Adam and Eve, they were thereby taught how their nakedne&s;s was to be covered with the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Lamb of God.</P>
<P>This is it which is meant, when we are told Abra|ham believed on the Lord, and it was counted to him for righteou&s;ne&s;s. In &s;hort, this is it of which both the law and all the prophets have &s;poken, e&s;pecially Jeremiah in the words of the text&mdash;<HI>The Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI>&mdash;

And as for you Socinians, who &s;ay Chri&s;t was a mere man, and yet profe&s;s that he was your Saviour, according to your own principles, you are accur&s;ed. For, if Chri&s;t be a mere man, then he is only an arm of fle&s;h&mdash;And it is written, <HI>Cur&s;ed is he that tru&s;teth on an arm of fle&s;h.</HI>&mdash;But I would hope there are no &s;uch mon&s;ters here. At lea&s;t, that after the&s;e con&s;iderations, they would be a&s;hamed of broaching &s;uch mon&s;trous ab&s;ur|dities any more.&mdash;For it is plain, that by the word Lord, we are to under&s;tand the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who here takes to him&s;elf the title of <HI>Jehovah,</HI> and therefore mu&s;t be very God, of very God, or, as the apo&s;tle devoutly expre&s;&s;es it, God <HI>ble&s;&s;ed for ever more.</HI></P>

<P>And that is, in one word, by <HI>imputation.</HI>&mdash;For it plea&s;ed God, after he had made all things <HI>by the word of his power,</HI> to create man after his own image. And &s;o infinite was the conde&s;cen&s;ion of the high and lofty One, who inhabiteth eternity, that although he might have in&s;i&s;ted on the everla&s;ting obedience of him and his po&s;terity, yet he was plea&s;ed to oblige him&s;elf, by a covenant or agreement made with his own creautures, upon condition of an un&s;inning obedi|ence, to give them immortality and eternal life.&mdash;For when it is &s;aid, <HI>the day thou ente&s;t thereof, thou &s;halt &s;urely die,</HI> we may fairly infer, &s;o long as he continued obedient, and did not eat thereof, he &s;hould &s;urely live.&mdash;The 3d of Gene&s;is gives us a full, but mourn|ful account, how our fir&s;t parents broke this cove|nant, and thereby &s;tood in need of a better righte|ou&s;ne&s;s than their own, in order to procure their fu|ture acceptance with God&mdash;For what mu&s;t they

do? They were as much under a covenant of works as ever. And, though after their di&s;obedience they were without &s;trength, yet they were obliged not on|ly to do, but continue to do all things, and that too in the mo&s;t perfect manner which the Lord had required of them.&mdash;And not only &s;o, but to make &s;atisfaction to God's infinitely offended ju&s;tice, for the breach they had already been guilty of&mdash;Here then opens the amazing &s;cene of divine philanthropy&mdash;I mean, God's love to man&mdash;For behold, what man could not do, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Son of his Father's love, undertakes to do for him. And that God might be ju&s;t in ju&s;tifying the ungodly, though he was in the form of God, and therefore thought it no robbery to be equal with God, yet he took upon him the form of a &s;ervant, even human nature&mdash;In that nature he obeyed, and thereby fulfilled the whole moral l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">w in our &s;tead.&mdash;And al&s;o died a painful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> the cro&s;s, and thereby became a cur&s;e for, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of, tho&s;e whom the Father had given him.

<P>Here then we &s;ee the meaning of the word <HI>righ|teou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> It implies the active, as well as pa&s;&s;ive obedience of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. We generally, when talking of the merits of Chri&s;t, only mention the latter, <HI>viz.</HI>&mdash;his death; whereas the former, <HI>viz.</HI> his life and active obedience, is equally nece&s;&s;ary. Chri&s;t is not &s;uch a Saviour as becomes us, unle&s;s we join both together.&mdash;Chri&s;t not only died, but lived; not only &s;uffered, but obeyed, for or in&s;tead of poor &s;in|ners. And both the&s;e jointly make up that complete righteou&s;ne&s;s which is to be imputed to us, as the di&s;|obedience of our fir&s;t parents was made ours by <HI>im|putation.</HI>
<PB N="36" REF="028079_0035_0FD69370F5ED86D8">
In this &s;en&s;e, and no other, are we to un|der&s;tand that parallel which St. Paul draws in the 5th of the Romans, between the fir&s;t and &s;econd Adam. This is what he el&s;ewhere terms our <HI>being made the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in him.</HI> This is the &s;en&s;e wherein the prophet would have us to under&s;tand the words of the text; therefore Jer. xxxiii. ver&s;e 16. <HI>She i. e.</HI> the church it&s;elf &s;hall be called (having this righteou&s;|ne&s;s imputed to her) the <HI>Lord our righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI>&mdash;A pa&s;&s;age, I think, worthy of the profounde&s;t medita|tion of all the &s;ons and daughters of Abraham.</P>
<P>Many are the objections which the proud hearts of fallen men are continually urging again&s;t this whole|&s;ome, this divine, this &s;oul &s;aving doctrine. I come now, in the third place, to an&s;wer &s;ome few of tho&s;e which I think the mo&s;t con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ay, becau&s;e they would appear friends to morality, <Q>That the doctrine of an im|puted righteou&s;ne&s;s is de&s;tructive of good works, and leads to licentiou&s;ne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>And who pray are the per&s;ons, that generally urge this objection? Are they men full of faith, and men really concerned for good works? No, whatever few exceptions there may be, if there be any at all, it is notorious, they are generally men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith. The be&s;t title I can give them is, that of profane morali&s;ts or morali&s;ts fal&s;ely &s;o called. For I appeal to the experience of the pre&s;ent, as well as pa&s;t ages, if iniquity did and does not mo&s;t abound where the doctrine of Chri&s;t's whole per&s;onal righteou&s;ne&s;s is mo&s;t cried down, and mo&s;t &s;eldom mentioned,&mdash;Arminian being antichri&s;|tian principles, always did and always will lead to antichri&s;tian practices. And never was there a refor|mation brought about in the church but by the preach|ing the doctrine of an imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s.&mdash;
<PB N="37" REF="028079_0036_0FD6937463936818">
This, as that man of God Luther calls it, is <HI>Articulus &s;tantis aut cadentis Eccle&s;ia&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">,</HI> the article by which the church &s;tands or falls.&mdash;And though the preach|ers of this doctrine are generally branded by tho&s;e on the other &s;ide with the opprobious names of antino|mians, deceivers, and what not; yet I believe, if the truth of the doctrine on both &s;ides was to be judged of by the lives of the preachers and profe&s;&s;ors of it, tho&s;e on our &s;ide the que&s;tion would have the advantage every way.</P>
<P>It is true, this, as well as every other doctrine of grace may be abu&s;ed. And perhaps the unchri&s;tian walk of &s;ome, who have talked of Chri&s;t's imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s, ju&s;tification by faith, and the like, and yet never felt it imputed to their own &s;ouls, has given the enemies of the Lord thus cau&s;e to bla&s;pheme. But this is a very un&s;afe, as well as very unfair way of arguing&mdash;The only que&s;tion &s;hould be, Whether or not this doctrine of an imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s does in it&s;elf cut off the occa&s;ion of good works, or lead to licentiou&s;ne&s;s? No, in no wi&s;e. It excludes works indeed from being any cau&s;e of our ju&s;tification in the &s;ight of God.&mdash;But it requires good works as a proof of our having this righteou&s;ne&s;s imputed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> us, and as a declarative evidence of our ju&s;tification in the &s;ight of men. And then how can the doctrine of an imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s be a doctrine leading to licentiou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>It is all calumny.&mdash;St. Paul introduces an infidel making this objection in his epi&s;tle to the Romans&mdash;And none but infidels, that never felt the power of Chri&s;t's re&s;urrection upon their &s;ouls, will urge it over again&mdash;And therefore, notwith&s;tanding this objection, with the prophet in the text, we may boldly &s;ay, <HI>The Lord our Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>But Satan, (and no wonder that his &s;ervants imi|tate

<P>But &s;urely the men who urge this objection, either never read, or never under&s;tood our ble&s;&s;ed Lord's di&s;cour&s;e, wherein the doctrine of an imputed righte|ou&s;ne&s;s is &s;o plainly taught, that he that runs, if he has eyes that &s;ee, may read.</P>
<P>Indeed our Lord does recommend morality and good works (as all faithful mini&s;ters will do) and clears the moral law from the many corrupt glo&s;&s;es put up|on it by the letter-learned Phari&s;ees&mdash;But then, be|fore he comes to this, it is remarkable, he talks of inward piety, &s;uch as poverty of &s;pirit, meekne&s;s, holy mourning, purity of heart,&mdash;e&s;pecially hunger|ing and thir&s;ting after righteou&s;ne&s;s, and then recom|mends good works, as an evidence of our having his righteou&s;ne&s;s imputed to us, and the&s;e graces and divine tempers wrought in our hearts&mdash;<Q>Let your light, (that is, the divine light I before have been mentioning) &s;hine before men, in a holy life, that they &s;eeing your good works, may glorify your Fa|ther which is in heaven.</Q>&mdash;And then immediately adds, <Q>Think not that I am come to de&s;troy the <HI>moral law</HI>&mdash;I came not to de&s;troy, to take away the force of it as a rule of life, but to fulfil, to obey it in its whole latitude, and give the complete &s;en&s;e of it.</Q>&mdash;And then he goes on to &s;hew, how exceeding broad the moral law is. So that our Lord, in&s;tead of di&s;annulling an imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s in his &s;er|mon upon the mount, not only confirms it, but al&s;o

an&s;wers the foregoing objection urged again&s;t it, by making good works a proof and evidence of its being imputed to our &s;ouls&mdash;He therefore that has ears to hear, let him hear what the prophet &s;ays in the words of the text&mdash;<HI>The Lord our Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>But as Satan not only quoted &s;cripture, but al&s;o backed one temptation with it after another, when he attacked Chri&s;t's per&s;on in the wilderne&s;s; &s;o his children generally take the &s;ame method in treating his doctrine. And therefore they urge another ob|jection again&s;t the doctrine of an imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s from the example of the young man in the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>We may &s;tate it thus:&mdash;<Q>The evangeli&s;t, St. Mark, &s;ay they, chap. x. mentions a young man that came to Chri&s;t, running and a&s;king him what he &s;hould do to inherit eternal life? Chri&s;t, &s;ay they, referred him to the commandments, to know what he mu&s;t do to inherit eternal life. It is plain therefore, works were to be partly, at lea&s;t, the cau&s;e of his ju&s;tification: and con&s;e|quently the doctrine of an imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s is un&s;criptural.</Q>&mdash;This is the objection in all its full &s;trength; and little &s;trength in all its fulne&s;s.&mdash;For, was I to prove the nece&s;&s;ity of an imputed righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, I &s;carce know how I could bring a better in&s;tance to make it good.</P>
<P>Let us take a more intimate view of this young man, and our Lord's behaviour towards him, Mark x. 17. the evangeli&s;t tells us, <Q>That when Chri&s;t was gone forth into the way, there came one run|ning (it &s;hould &s;eem it was &s;ome nobleman, a ra|rity indeed, to &s;ee &s;uch a one running to Chri&s;t!) and not only &s;o, but he kneeled to him (tho' per|haps many of his rank now &s;carce know the time when they kneeled to Chri&s;t) and <HI>a&s;ked him, &s;ay|ing, Good ma&s;ter, what &s;hall I do that I may inherit

eternal life?</HI></Q>&mdash;Then Je&s;us, to &s;ee whether or not he believed him to be what he really was, truly and properly God, &s;aid unto him; <HI>Why calle&s;t thou me good? There is none good but one, that is God.</HI>&mdash;And that he might directly an&s;wer his que&s;tion; &s;ays he, <HI>Thou knowe&s;t the commandments: Do not commit adul|tery, Do not bear fal&s;e witne&s;s, Defraud not, Honour thy father and thy mother.</HI> This, I &s;ay, was a direct an&s;wer to his que&s;tion; namely, that eternal life was not to be attained by his doings.&mdash;For our Lord, by referring him to the commandments, did not (as the objectors in&s;inuate) in the lea&s;t hint, that his moral|ity would recommend him to the favour and mercy of God.&mdash;But he intended thereby to make the law his &s;choolma&s;ter to bring him to him&s;elf; that the young man, &s;eeing how he had broken every one of the&s;e commandments, might thereby be convinced of the in&s;ufficiency of his own, and con&s;equently of the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of looking out for a better righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, whereon he might depend for eternal life.</P>
<P>This was what our Lord de&s;igned.&mdash;The young man being &s;elf-righteous, and willing to ju&s;tify him|&s;elf, &s;aid, <HI>All the&s;e have I ob&s;erved from my youth</HI>&mdash;But had he known him&s;elf, he would have confe&s;&s;ed, <HI>All the&s;e have I broken from my youth.</HI>&mdash;For &s;uppo&s;ing he had not actually committed adultery, had he never lu&s;ted after a woman in his heart? What, if he had not really killed another; had he never been an|gry without a cau&s;e, or &s;poken unadvi&s;edly with his lips? If &s;o, by breaking one of the lea&s;t command|ments in the lea&s;t degree, he became liable to the cur&s;e of God: For, <HI>cur&s;ed is he,</HI> (&s;aith the law) <HI>that continueth not to do all things that are written in this book.</HI>&mdash;And therefore, as I ob&s;erved before, our Lord was &s;o far from &s;peaking again&s;t, that he treated the young man in that manner on purpo&s;e to convince him of the nece&s;&s;ity of an imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="028079_0040_0FD6937BDDB11300">
But perhaps they will reply, it is &s;aid, <HI>Je&s;us behold|ing him, loved him.</HI> And what then? This he might do with a human love, and at the &s;ame time this young man have no intere&s;t in his blood.&mdash;Thus Chri&s;t is &s;aid to wonder,&mdash;to weep over Jeru&s;alem, and &s;ay&mdash;<HI>Oh that thou had&s;t</HI> KNOWN, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But &s;uch like pa&s;&s;ages are to be referred only to his human na|ture. And there is a great deal of difference between the love wherewith Chri&s;t loved this young man, and that wherewith he loved Mary, Lazarus, and their &s;i&s;ter Martha.&mdash;To illu&s;trate this by a compari&s;on.&mdash;A mini&s;ter of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;eeing many amiable di&s;po&s;itions, &s;uch as a readine&s;s to hear the word, a decent behaviour at public wor&s;hip, a life outwardly &s;potle&s;s in many, cannot but &s;o far love them. But then there is much difference betwixt that love which a mini&s;ter feels for &s;uch, and that di|vine love, that union and &s;ympathy of &s;oul, which he feels for tho&s;e that he is &s;atisfied are really born again of God.&mdash;Apply this to our Lord's ca&s;e, as a &s;aint illu&s;tration of it&mdash;Con&s;ider what has been &s;aid upon the young man's ca&s;e in general, and then, if before you were fond of this objection, in&s;tead of triumph|ing like him, you will go &s;orrowful away.&mdash;Our Saviour's reply to him more and more convinces us of the truth of the prophet's a&s;&s;ertion in the text, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>the Lord is our Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>But there is a fourth and grand objection yet be|hind, and that is taken from the 25th chapter of St. Matthew, <Q>where our Lord is de&s;cribed, as reward|ing people with eternal life, becau&s;e they fed the hungry, clothed the naked, and &s;uch like.&mdash;Their works therefore were a cau&s;e of their ju&s;tification; con&s;equently, the doctrine of imputed righteou&s;|ne&s;s is not agreeable to &s;cripture.</Q></P>
<P>This, I confe&s;s, is the mo&s;t plau&s;ible objection that
<PB N="42" REF="028079_0041_0FD6937D538FB0C0">
is brought again&s;t the doctrine in&s;i&s;ted on from the text. And in order that we may an&s;wer it in as clear and as brief a manner as may be, we confe&s;s, with the article of the church of England, <Q>That albeit good works do not ju&s;tify us, yet they will follow after ju&s;tification, as fruits of it; and tho' they can claim no reward in them&s;elves, yet fora&s;much as they &s;pring from faith in Chri&s;t, and a renewed &s;oul, they &s;hall receive a reward <HI>of grace,</HI> though not <HI>of debt;</HI> and con&s;equently, the more we abound in &s;uch good works, the greater will be our reward when Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hall come to judgment.</Q></P>
<P>Take the&s;e con&s;iderations, along with us, and they will help us much to an&s;wer the objection now be|fore us.&mdash;For thus St. Matthew&mdash;<HI>Then &s;hall the King &s;ay to them on his right hand, Come ye ble&s;&s;ed children of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world&mdash;For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat. I was thir&s;ty, and ye gave me drink. I was a &s;tranger, and ye took me in. Naked, and ye clothed me. I was &s;ick, and ye vi&s;ited me. I was in pri&s;on, and ye came unto me.</HI> <Q>I will there|fore reward you, becau&s;e you have done the&s;e things out of love to me, and hereby have evidenced your&s;elves to be my true di&s;ciples.</Q>&mdash;And that the people did not depend on the&s;e good actions for their ju&s;tification in the &s;ight of God is evident. <HI>For when &s;aw we thee an hungered,</HI> &s;ay they, <HI>and fed thee? Or thir&s;ty, and gave thee drink? When &s;aw we thee a &s;tranger, and took thee in? Or naked, and cloathed thee? Or when &s;aw we thee &s;ick, or in pri&s;on and came unto thee?</HI>&mdash;Language and que&s;tions quite improper for per&s;ons relying on their own righteou&s;|ne&s;s for acceptance and acquittance in the &s;ight of God.</P>
<P>But then they reply again&s;t this.&mdash;In the latter part
<PB N="43" REF="028079_0042_0FD6937ECF8799E8">
of the chapter, &s;ay they, it is plain that Je&s;us Chri&s;t rejects and damns the others for not doing the&s;e things. And therefore, if he damns tho&s;e for not doing, he &s;ave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> tho&s;e for doing; and con&s;equently the doctrine of an imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s is good for nothing.</P>
<P>But that is no con&s;equence at all&mdash;For God may ju&s;tly damn any man for omitting the lea&s;t duty of the moral law, and yet in him&s;elf is not obliged to give any one any reward, &s;uppo&s;ing he has done all that he can. We are unprofitable &s;ervants, we have done not near &s;o much as it was our duty to do, mu&s;t be the language of the mo&s;t holy &s;ouls living; and therefore from or in our&s;elves, cannot be ju&s;tified in the &s;ight of God&mdash;This was the frame of the devout &s;ouls ju&s;t now referred to&mdash;Sen&s;ible of this, they were &s;o far from depending on their works for ju&s;tification in the &s;ight of God, that they were filled, as it were with a holy blu&s;hing, to think our Lord &s;hould con|de&s;cend to mention, much more to reward them for their poor works of faith and labours of love. I am per&s;uaded their hearts would ri&s;e with a holy indig|nation again&s;t tho&s;e who urge this pa&s;&s;age as an ob|jection again&s;t the a&s;&s;ertion of the prophet in the words of the text, that the <HI>Lord is our Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Thus I think we have fairly an&s;wered the&s;e grand objections, which are generally urged again&s;t the doc|trine of an imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s.&mdash;Was I to &s;top here, I think I might &s;ay, we are made more than conquerors, through him that loved us&mdash;But there is a way of arguing which I have always admired, becau&s;e I have thought always very convincing, <HI>viz.</HI> by &s;hewing the ab&s;urdities that will follow from de|nying any particular propo&s;ition in di&s;pute.</P>
<P>IV. This is the next thing that was propo&s;ed. <Q>And never did greater or more ab&s;urdities flow
<PB N="44" REF="028079_0043_0FD693812A3DBC68">
from the denying any doctrine, than will flow from denying the doctrine of Chri&s;t's imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>And fir&s;t, if we deny this doctrine, we turn the truth. I mean the word of God, as much as we can into a lie, and utterly &s;ubvert all tho&s;e places of &s;crip|ture, which &s;ay, <HI>That we are &s;aved by grace; that it is not of works, le&s;t any man &s;hould boa&s;t.</HI>&mdash;That &s;alva|tion is God's free gift&mdash;and that, <HI>He that glorieth, mu&s;t glory only in the Lord.</HI> For if the whole per&s;onal righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t be not the &s;ole cau&s;e of my acceptance with God, if any work done by or fore&s;een in me, was in the lea&s;t to be joined with it, or looked upon by God as an inducing impul&s;ive cau&s;e of acquitting my &s;oul from guilt, then I have &s;ome|what whereof I may glory in my&s;elf. Now boa&s;ting is excluded in the great work of our redemption. But that cannot be, if we are enemies to the doctrine of an imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s.&mdash;It would be endle&s;s to enumerate how many texts of &s;cripture mu&s;t be fal&s;e, if this doctrine be not true. Let it &s;uffice to affirm in the general, that if we deny an imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s, we may as well deny a divine revela|tion all at once.&mdash;For it is the alpha and omega, the beginning and the end of the book of God.&mdash;We mu&s;t either di&s;believe that, or believe what the prophet hath &s;poken in the text, <HI>That the Lord is our Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>But farther.&mdash;I ob&s;erved at the beginning of this di&s;cour&s;e, that we are all Arminians and Papi&s;ts by nature;&mdash;for, as one ob&s;erves, Arminiani&s;m is the back way to Popery. And here I venture further to affirm, <Q>That if we deny the doctrine of an imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s, whatever we may &s;tyle our&s;elves, we are really Papi&s;ts in our hearts, and de&s;erve no other title from men.</Q></P>

<P>WHEN I read to you the&s;e words, I may ad|dre&s;s you in the language of the holy angels, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he Shepherds that were watching their flocks by night; <HI>Behold, I bring you glad tidings of great joy.</HI> For <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">his is the fir&s;t promi&s;e that was made of a Savi|our to the apo&s;tate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ace of Adam. We generally look for Chri&s;t only in the New-Te&s;tament; but Chri&s;tianity, in one &s;en&s;e, is very near as old as the creation. It is wonderful to ob&s;erve, how gradually God revealed his Son to mankind. He began with the promi&s;e in the text, and this the elect lived upon till the time of Abraham; to him God made fur|ther di&s;coveries of his eternal coun&s;el concerning man's redemption. Afterwards, at &s;undry times, and in divers manners, God &s;pake to the fathers by the pro|phets, till at length the Lord Je&s;us him&s;elf was manife&s;ted in the fle&s;h, and came and tabernacled among&s;t us.</P>
<P>This fir&s;t promi&s;e mu&s;t certainly be but dark to our
<PB N="56" REF="028079_0054_0FD6939EA4E55BB8">
fir&s;t parents, in compari&s;on of that light which we now enjoy. And yet, dark as it was, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> may a&s;&s;ure our&s;elves they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ilt upon it their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> everla&s;ting &s;alvation, and by that faith were &s;aved.</P>
<P>How they came to &s;tand in need of this promi&s;e, and what is the extent and meaning of it, I intend, God willing, to make the &s;ubject-matter of your pre|&s;ent meditation.</P>
<P>The fall of man is written in too legible characters not to be under&s;tood: tho&s;e that deny it, by their de|nying prove it. The very heathens confe&s;&s;ed and be|wailed it: They could &s;ee the &s;treams of corruption running through the whole race of mankind, but could not trace them to the fountain-head. Before God gave a revelation of his Son, man was a riddle to him&s;elf. And Mo&s;es unfolds more in this one chapter (out of which the text is taken) than all man|kind could have been capable of finding out of them|&s;elves though they had &s;tudied to all eternity.</P>
<P>In the foregoing chapter, he had given us a full account, how God &s;poke the world into being; and e&s;pecially how he formed man of the du&s;t of the earth, and breathed into him the breath of life, &s;o that he became a living &s;oul. A council of the Tri|nity was called concerning the formation of this lovely creature. The re&s;ult of that council was, <HI>Let us make man in our image, after our likene&s;s. So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created be him.</HI> Mo&s;es remarkably repeats the words, that we might take particular notice of our divine original. Never was &s;o much expre&s;&s;ed in &s;o few words. None but a man in&s;pired could have done &s;o. But it is re|markable, that though Mo&s;es mentions our being made in the image of God, yet he mentions it but twice, and that, as it were, in a tran&s;ient manner, as though he would have &s;aid, <Q>Man was made in
<PB N="57" REF="028079_0055_0FD6939FCC165858">
honour, God made him upright, <HI>in the image of God, male and female created be them.</HI> But man &s;o &s;oon fell, and became like the bea&s;ts that peri&s;h, nay, like the devil him&s;elf, that it is &s;carce worth mentioning.</Q></P>
<P>How &s;oon man fell after he was created, is not told us, and therefore to fix any time, is to be wi&s;e above what is written. And, I think, they who &s;uppo&s;e that man fell the &s;ame day in which he w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> made, have no &s;ufficient ground for their opinion. The ma|ny things which are crowded together in the former chapter, &s;uch as the formation of Adam's wife, his giving names to the bea&s;ts, and his being put into the garden which God had planted, I think require a longer &s;pace of time than a day to be tran&s;acted in. However all agree in this, "Man &s;tood not long." How long or how &s;hort a while, I will not take upon me to determine. It more concerns us to enquire how he came to fall from his &s;teadfa&s;tne&s;s, and what was the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of the temptation which prevail|ed over him. The account given us in this chapter concerning it, is very full, and it may do us much &s;ervice, under God, to make &s;ome remarks upon it.</P>
<P><HI>Now the &s;erpent,</HI> &s;ays the &s;acred hi&s;torian, <HI>was more &s;ubtil than any bea&s;t of the field which the Lord God had made, and he &s;aid unto the woman, yea, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> God &s;aid, ye &s;hall not eat of every tree of the garden.</HI></P>
<P>Though this was a real &s;erpent, yet he that &s;poke was no other than the devil; from hence, perhaps, called the old &s;erpent, becau&s;e he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;erpent when he came to beguile our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> parents. The devil envied the happine&s;s of man, who was made, as &s;ome think, to &s;upply the place of fallen angels. God made man upright, and with full power to &s;tand if he would. He was ju&s;t, therefore in &s;uf|fering him to be tempted: if he fell, he had no one
<PB N="58" REF="028079_0056_0FD693A50BAA63A0">
to blame except him&s;elf. But how mu&s;t Satan effect his fall? He cannot do it by his power, he attempts it therefore by policy. He takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;erpent, which was more &s;ubtil than all the bea&s;ts of the field, which the Lord God had made; &s;o that men that are full of &s;ubtility, but have no piety, are only machines for the devil to work upon, ju&s;t as he plea&s;es.</P>
<P><HI>And he &s;aid unto the Woman.</HI> Here is an in&s;tance of his &s;ubtility. He &s;ays unto the woman, the weak|er ve&s;&s;el, and when &s;he was alone from her hu&s;band, and therefore was more liable to be overcome, <HI>Yea, hath God &s;aid, ye &s;hall not eat of every tree of the gar|den?</HI> The&s;e words are certainly &s;poken in an&s;wer to &s;omething which the devil either &s;aw or heard. In all probability, the woman was now near the tree of knowledge of good and evil; (for we &s;hall find her by and by, plucking an apple from it,) perhaps <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he might be looking at, and wondering what there was in that tree more than the others, that &s;he and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> hu&s;band &s;hould be forbidden to ta&s;te of it. Satan &s;ee|ing this, and coveting to draw her into a parley with him (for if the devil can per&s;uade us not to re&s;i&s;t, but to commune with him, he hath gained a great point) he &s;ays, <HI>Yea, hath God &s;aid, ye &s;hall not eat of every tree in the garden?</HI> The fir&s;t thing he does, is to per|&s;uade her if po&s;&s;ible, to entertain hard thoughts of God; this is his general way of dealing with God's children. <Q>Yea, &s;ays he, hath God &s;aid, ye &s;hall not eat of every tree of the garden? What! hath God planted a garden and placed you in the mid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> of it only to teaze and perplex you? hath he plant|ed a garden, and yet forbid you making u&s;e of any of the fruits of it at all?</Q> It was impo&s;&s;ible for him to a&s;k a more en&s;naring que&s;tion in order to gain his end: For Eve was here &s;eemingly obliged to an&s;wer, and vindicate God's goodne&s;s. And therefore,</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="028079_0057_0FD693A997D0D510">
Ver. 2. 3. The woman &s;aid unto the &s;erpent, <HI>We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: But, of the fruit of the tree which is in the mid&s;t of the garden, God hath &s;aid, ye &s;hall not eat of it, neither &s;hall ye touch it, le&s;t ye die.</HI></P>
<P>The former part of the an&s;wer was good, <Q>We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden, God has not forbid us eating of every tree of the garden. No, we may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden, (and it &s;hould &s;eem even of the tree of life, which was as a &s;acrament to man in a &s;tate of innocence) there is only one tree in the mid&s;t of the garden, of which God hath &s;aid, Ye &s;hall not eat of it, neither &s;hall ye touch it, le&s;t ye die.</Q> Here &s;he begins to warp, and &s;in begins to conceive in her heart. Already has &s;he contracted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the &s;erpent's poi&s;on, by talking with him, which &s;he ought not to have done at all. For &s;he might ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e, that it could be no good being, that could put &s;uch a que&s;tion unto her, and in&s;inuate &s;uch di&s;|honourable thoughts of God. She &s;hould therefore have fled from him, and not &s;tood to have parleyed with him at all. Immediately the ill effects of it appear, &s;he begins to &s;often the divine threatening. God had &s;aid, the <HI>day thou eate&s;t thereof, thou &s;halt &s;urely die:</HI> or, <HI>dying thou &s;halt die:</HI> But Eve &s;ays, Ye &s;hall not eat of it, neither &s;hall ye touch it, le&s;t ye die. We may be a&s;&s;ured we are fallen into, and begin to fall by temptation, when we begin to think God will not be as good as his word, in re&s;pect to the execution of his threatnings denounced again&s;t &s;in. Satan knew this, and therefore artfully</P>
<P>Said unto the woman, (ver. 4.) <HI>Ye &s;hall not &s;urely die,</HI> in an in&s;inuating manner, <Q>Ye &s;hall not &s;urely die. Surely God will not be &s;o cruel as to damn you only for eating an apple: it cannot be.</Q> <GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="1 page">

mea&s;ure, to his eating that fruit; and therefore, if he received &s;o much improvement, &s;he might al&s;o ex|pect a like benefit from it. All this, I think, is clear; for, otherwi&s;e, I do not &s;ee with what propriety it could be &s;aid, <HI>When the Woman &s;aw that it was good for food.</HI> How could &s;he know it was good for food, unle&s;s &s;he had &s;een the &s;erpent feed upon it?</P>
<P>Satan now begins to get ground apace. Lu&s;t had conceived in her heart; &s;hortly it will bring forth &s;in. Sin being conceived, brings forth death. Ver. 6. <HI>And when the Woman &s;aw that the tree was good for food, and that it was plea&s;ant to the eyes, and a tree to be de&s;ired to make one wi&s;e, &s;he took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave al&s;o unto her hu&s;band, and he did eat.</HI></P>
<P>Our &s;en&s;es are the landing ports of our &s;piritual enemies. How needful is that re&s;olution of holy Job, <HI>I have made a covenant with mine eyes.</HI> When Eve began to gaze on the forbidden fruit with her eyes, &s;he &s;oon began to long after it with her heart. When &s;he &s;aw that it was good for food, and plea&s;ant to the eyes, (here was the lu&s;t of the fle&s;h, and lu&s;t of the eye) but, above all, a tree to be de&s;ired, to make one wi&s;e, wi&s;er than God would have her be, nay, as wi&s;e as God him&s;elf: &s;he took of the fruit thereof, and gave al&s;o unto her hu&s;band with her, and he did eat.

<P>Alas! what a complication of crimes was there in this one &s;ingle act of &s;in!

<P>And what are the con&s;equences of their di&s;obedi|ence? Are their eyes opened? Yes, their eyes are opened; but, alas! it is only to &s;ee their own naked|ne&s;s.

<P>Before I proceed to the explanation of this ver&s;e, I cannot but take notice of one great mi&s;take, which the author of the <HI>Whole Duty of Man</HI> is guilty of, in making this ver&s;e contain a covenant between God and Adam, as though God per&s;onally treated with Adam, as before the fall. For, talking of the &s;econd covenant, in his preface concerning caring for the &s;oul, &s;ays he, <Q>This &s;econd covenant was made with Adam, and us in him, pre&s;ently after the fall, and is contained in the&s;e words, Gen. iii. 15. where God declares <HI>the &s;eed of the woman &s;hall

break the &s;erpent's head;</HI> and this was made up, as the fir&s;t was, of &s;ome mercies to be afforded by God, and &s;ome duties to be performed by us.</Q> This is exceeding fal&s;e divinity: For the&s;e words are not &s;poken to Adam; they are directed only to the &s;erpent. Adam and Eve &s;tood by as criminals, and God could not treat with them, becau&s;e they had broken his covenant. And it is &s;o far from being a covenant, wherein, <Q>&s;ome mercies are to be afforded by God, and &s;ome duties to be performed by us,</Q> that here is not a word looking that way; it is only a declaration of a free gift of &s;alvation through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord. God the Father and God the Son had entered into a covenant concerning the &s;alvation of the elect from all eternity; wherein God the Fa|ther promi&s;ed, that if the Son would offer his &s;oul a &s;acrifice for &s;in, he &s;hould &s;ee his &s;eed. Now this is a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> open revelation of this &s;ecret covenant, and there|fore God &s;peaks in the mo&s;t po&s;itive terms. <HI>It &s;hall brui&s;e thy head, and thou &s;halt brui&s;e his heel.</HI> The fir&s;t Adam God had treated with before; he proved fal&s;e; God therefore to &s;ecure the &s;econd covenant from being broken, puts it into the hands of the &s;econd Adam, the Lord from heaven. Adam, after the fall, &s;tood no longer as our repre&s;entative; he and Eve were only private per&s;ons as we are, and were only to hold on the declaration of mercy con|tained in this promi&s;e by faith (as they really did) and by that they were &s;aved. I do not &s;ay, but we are to believe and obey, if we are everla&s;tingly &s;aved. Faith and obedience are conditions, if we only mean that they in order go before our &s;alvation; but I deny that the&s;e are propo&s;ed by God to Adam, or that God treats with him on this promi&s;e, as he did before the fall under the covenant of works. For, how could that be, when Adam and Eve were now pri|&s;oners,
<PB N="71" REF="028079_0068_0FD693C9F6BB5A40">
at the bar, without &s;trength to perform any conditions at all? The truth is this: God as a reward of Chri&s;t's &s;ufferings, promi&s;ed to give the elect faith and repentance, in order to bring them to eternal life: And both the&s;e and every thing el&s;e nece&s;&s;ary for their everla&s;ting happine&s;s, are infallibly &s;ecured to them in this promi&s;e, as Mr. Bo&s;ton, an excellent Scotch divine, &s;weetly and clearly &s;hews, in a book intitled, <HI>A view of the covenant of grace.</HI></P>
<P>This is, by no means, an unnece&s;&s;ary di&s;tinction; it is a matter of great importance: For want of know|ing this, people have been &s;o long mi&s;led. They have been taught that they mu&s;t Do &s;o and &s;o, as though they were under a covenant of works; and then for DOING this, they &s;hould be &s;aved. This is plainly the whole drift of the book wrongly intitled, <HI>The Whole Duty of Man.</HI> Whereas, on the contrary, peo|ple &s;hould be taught, that the Lord Je&s;us was the &s;econd Adam, with whom the Father entered into covenant for fallen man: that they can now do no|thing of or for them&s;elves, and &s;hould therefore come to God, be&s;eech him to give them faith, by which they &s;hall be enabled to lay hold on the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t; and that faith they will then &s;hew forth by their works, out of love and gratitude to the ever-ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, their mo&s;t glorious Redeemer, for what he has done for their &s;ouls. This is a con&s;i&s;tent &s;criptural &s;cheme: without holding this, we mu&s;t run into one of tho&s;e two bad extremes; I mean, Anti|nomiani&s;m on the one hand, or Arminiani&s;m on the other: from both which may the good Lord deliver us.</P>
<P>But to proceed: by the <HI>&s;eed of the woman,</HI> we are here to under&s;tand the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who though very God of very God was, for us men and our &s;al|vation, to have a body prepared for him by the Holy

<P>It is not to be doubted but Adam and Eve under|&s;tood this promi&s;e in this &s;en&s;e; for it is plain, in the latter part of the chapter, &s;acrifices were in&s;tituted.

We find Abel, as well as Cain, offering &s;acrifice in the next chapter: and the apo&s;tle tells us, he did it by <HI>faith,</HI> no doubt in this promi&s;e.

Adam believed al&s;o, and was &s;aved: for unto Adam and his wife did the Lord make coats of &s;kins, and cloathed THEM, which was a remarkable type of their being clothed with the righteou&s;ne&s;s of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>

per&s;ecution again&s;t him, during the time of his pub|lic mini&s;try: he, in an e&s;pecial manner, brui&s;ed his heel, when our Lord complained, that his <HI>&s;oul was exceeding &s;orrowful even unto death, and be &s;weat great drops of blood, falling upon the ground,</HI> when praying in the garden: he brui&s;ed his heel, when he put it in the heart of Judas to betray him; and he brui&s;ed him yet mo&s;t of all, when his emi&s;&s;aries nailed him to an accur&s;ed tree, and our Lord cried out, <HI>My God, my God! why ha&s;t thou for&s;aken me?</HI> Yet in all this, the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, the &s;eed of the woman, brui&s;ed Satan's accur&s;ed head: for, in that he was tempted he was able to <HI>&s;uccour tho&s;e that are tempted.</HI> By <HI>his &s;tripes we are healed.</HI> The cha&s;ti&s;ement of our peace was upon him. By dying, he de&s;troyed him that had the power of death, that is the devil. He thereby &s;poiled principalities and powers, and made a &s;hew of them openly, triumphing over them upon the cro&s;s.</P>
<P>This promi&s;e has been, is, and will be fulfilled in the elect of God, con&s;idered collectively, as well before, as after the coming of our Lord in the fle&s;h: for they may be called the <HI>&s;eed of the woman.</HI> Mar|vel not, that <HI>all who will live godly in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, mu&s;t &s;uffer per&s;ecution.</HI> In this promi&s;e, there is an eternal enmity put between the &s;eed of the woman and the &s;eed of the &s;erpent; &s;o that tho&s;e that are born after the fle&s;h, cannot but per&s;ecute tho&s;e that are born after the Spirit. This enmity &s;hewed it&s;elf &s;oon after this promi&s;e was revealed, in Cain's brui&s;ing the heel of Abel: it continued in the church through all ages before Chri&s;t came in the fle&s;h, as the hi&s;tory of the Bible and the eleventh chapter of the Hebrews plainly &s;hews. It raged exceedingly after our Lord's a&s;cen&s;ion; witne&s;s the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, and the hi&s;tory of the primitive Chri&s;tians.
<PB N="74" REF="028079_0071_0FD693D226BC61C0">
It now rages, and will continue to rage and &s;hew it&s;elf, in a greater or le&s;s degree to the end of time. But let not this di&s;may us; for in all this the &s;eed of the woman is more than conqueror, and brui&s;es the &s;erpent's head Thus the I&s;raelites, the more they were oppre&s;&s;ed, the more they increa&s;ed. Thus it was with the apo&s;tles; thus it was with their immediate followers. So that Tertullian compares the church in his time to a mowed field; the more frequently it is cut, the more it grows. The blood of the martyrs was always the &s;eed of the church. And I have often &s;at down with wonder and delight, and admired how God has made the very &s;chemes which his enemies contrived in order to hinder, be|come the mo&s;t effectual means to propagate his go&s;|pel. The devil has had &s;o little &s;ucce&s;s in per&s;ecu|tion, that if I did not know that he and his children, according to this ver&s;e, could not but per&s;ecute, I &s;hould think he would count it his &s;trength to &s;it &s;till. What did he get by per&s;ecuting the martyrs in queen Mary's time? Was not the grace of God exceedingly glorified in their &s;upport! What did he get by per&s;ecuting the good old Puritans? Did it not prove the peopling of New-England? Or to come nearer our own times. What hath he got by putting us out of the &s;ynagogues? Hath not the word of God, &s;ince that, mightily prevailed? My dear hearers, you mu&s;t excu&s;e me for enlarging on this head; God fills my &s;oul generally, when I come to this topic. I can &s;ay with Luther, <Q>If it were not for per&s;ecution, I &s;hould not under&s;tand the &s;cripture.</Q> If Satan &s;hould be yet &s;uffered to brui&s;e my heel further, and his &s;ervants &s;hould thru&s;t me into pri&s;on, I doubt not, but even that would only tend to the more effectual brui&s;ing of his head. I remember a &s;aying of the then Lord

<P>Further: This promi&s;e is al&s;o fulfilled, not only in the church in general, but in every individual believer in particular. In every believer there are two &s;eeds, the &s;eed of the woman, and the &s;eed of the &s;erpent; the fle&s;h lu&s;ting again&s;t the Spirit, and the Spirit again&s;t the fle&s;h. It is with the believer, when quickened with grace in his heart, as it was with Rebeccah, when &s;he had conceived E&s;au and Jacob in her womb; &s;he felt a &s;truggling, and be|gan to be unea&s;y; <HI>If it be &s;o,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>why am I thus?</HI> Thus grace and nature &s;truggle, (if I may &s;o &s;peak) in the womb of a believer's heart: But, as it was there &s;aid, the elder &s;hall &s;erve the younger: &s;o it is here,&mdash;grace in the end &s;hall get the better of nature; the &s;eed of the woman &s;hall brui&s;e the &s;erpent's head. Many of you that have believed in Chri&s;t, perhaps may find &s;ome particular corruption yet &s;trong, &s;o &s;trong, that you are &s;ometimes ready to cry out with David, <HI>I &s;hall fall one day by the hand of Saul.</HI> But fear not, the promi&s;e in the text in|&s;ures the per&s;everance and victory of believers over Sin, Satan, Death, and Hell. What if indwelling corruption does yet remain, and the &s;eed of the &s;er|pent brui&s;e your heel, in vexing and di&s;turbing your righteous &s;ouls? Fear not, though faint, yet pur|&s;ue: You &s;hall yet brui&s;e the &s;erpent's head.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHEN our Lord Je&s;us was plea&s;ed to take upon him&s;elf the form of a &s;ervant, and go about preaching the kingdom of God, he took all opportunities in public, and more e&s;pecially in pri|vate, to caution his di&s;ciples again&s;t &s;eeking great things for them&s;elves; and al&s;o to forwarn them of the many di&s;tre&s;&s;es, afflictions, and per&s;ecutions which they mu&s;t expect to endure and go through for his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ake. The great St. Paul, therefore, the author of this epi&s;tle, in this, as in all other things, following the &s;teps of his ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter, takes par|ticular care, among other apo&s;tolical admonitions, to warn young Timothy of the difficulties he mu&s;t ex|pect to meet when in the cour&s;e of his mini&s;try:&mdash;<Q>This know al&s;o, (&s;ays he, ver&s;e 1&s;t of this chapter) that in the la&s;t days perilous times &s;hall come. For men &s;hall be lovers of their own &s;elves, co|vetous, boa&s;ters, proud, bla&s;phemers, di&s;obedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural af|fection, truce-breakers, fal&s;e accu&s;ers, incontinent, fierce, de&s;pi&s;ers of tho&s;e that are good, traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of plea&s;ure more than

lovers of God; having a form of godline&s;s, but denying the power thereof: from &s;uch turn away. For of this &s;ort are they which creep into hou&s;es, and lead captive filly women laden with &s;ins&mdash;lead away with divers lu&s;ts; ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</Q> <HI>Now, as Jannes and Jambres</HI> (two of the Egyptian magi|cians) <HI>with&s;tood Mo&s;es</HI> (by working &s;ham miracles) <HI>&s;o do the&s;e al&s;o re&s;i&s;t the truth:</HI> and (notwith&s;tanding they keep up the form of religion) <HI>are men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.</HI> But, in order to keep him from &s;inking under their oppo&s;ition, he tells him, that though God, for wi&s;e ends, permit|ted the&s;e fal&s;e teachers, as he did the magicians, to oppo&s;e for &s;ome time, yet they &s;hould now proceed no farther. <HI>For their folly,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>&s;hall be made manife&s;t unto all men, as theirs</HI> (the magicians) <HI>al&s;o was,</HI> when they could not &s;tand before Mo&s;es, be|cau&s;e of the boil; for the boil was upon the magi|cians as well as upon all the Egyptians. And then to encourage Timothy yet the more, he propounds to him his own example: <Q>But thou ha&s;t fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpo&s;e, faith, long|&s;uffering, charity, patience, per&s;ecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Ly&s;tra; what per&s;ecutions I endured; But out of them all the Lord delivered me.</Q> And then le&s;t Timothy might think that this was only the parti|cular ca&s;e of Paul: <HI>Yea,</HI> &s;ays he, in the words of the text, <HI>and all that will live godly in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, &s;hall &s;uffer per&s;ecution,</HI></P>
<P>The words, without con&s;idering them as they &s;tand in relation to the context, contain a nece&s;&s;ary and important truth, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>per&s;ecution</HI> is the common lot of every godly man. This is a hard &s;aying. How few can bear it? I tru&s;t God, in the following di&s;|cour&s;e, will enable me to make it good, by &s;hewing,

</LIST></P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> We &s;hall apply the whole.</P>
<P>And <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> Let us con&s;ider what it is to live godly in Chri&s;t Je&s;us: this &s;uppo&s;es, that we are made the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in Chri&s;t, that we are born again, and are made one with Chri&s;t by a living faith, and a vital union, even as Je&s;us Chri&s;t and the Father are one. Unle&s;s we are thus converted; and transformed by the renewing of our minds, we cannot properly be &s;aid to be in Chri&s;t, much le&s;s to live godly in him. To be in Chri&s;t merely by bap|ti&s;m, and an outward profe&s;&s;ion, is not to be in him in the &s;trict &s;en&s;e of the word: No; They that are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, are new creatures; old things are pa&s;&s;ed away, and all things are become new in their hearts. Their life is hid with Chri&s;t in God; their &s;ouls daily feed on the invi&s;ible realties of another world. To live godly in Chri&s;t, is to make the divine will, and not our own, the &s;ole principle of all our thoughts, words, and actions; &s;o that, whe|ther we eat or drink, or what&s;oever we do, we do all to the glory of God. Tho&s;e who live godly in Chri&s;t, may not &s;o much be &s;aid to live, as Chri&s;t to live in them; he is their alpha and omega, their fir&s;t and la&s;t, their beginning and end. They are led by his Spirit, as a child is led by the hand of its Father; and are willing to follow the Lamb whither&s;oever he leads them. They hear, know, and obey his voice. Their affections are &s;et on things above. Their hopes are full of immortality; their citizen&s;hip is in heaven. Being born again of God, they habitually live to, and daily walk with
<PB N="81" REF="028079_0078_0FD693DE9FD52B80">
God. They are pure in heart; and, from a prin|ciple of faith in Chri&s;t, are holy in all manner of conver&s;ation and godline&s;s.</P>
<P>This is to live godly in Chri&s;t Je&s;us: and hence we may ea&s;ily learn, why &s;o few &s;uffer per&s;ecution? becau&s;e &s;o few live godly in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. You may attend on outward duties; you may live morally in Chri&s;t, <HI>i. e.</HI> you may do (as they term it) no one any harm, and avoid per&s;ecution: but they that will live godly in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, mu&s;t &s;uffer per&s;ecution.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Secondly,</HI> What is the meaning of the word <HI>per&s;ecution,</HI> and how many kinds there are of it, I come now to con&s;ider.</P>
<P>The word <HI>per&s;ecution</HI> is derived from a Greek word, &s;ignifying to <HI>pur&s;ue,</HI> and generally implies, <Q>pur&s;uing a per&s;on for the &s;ake of his goodne&s;s, or God's good will to him.</Q> The fir&s;t kind of it, is that of the heart. We have an early example of this in that wicked one Cain, who, becau&s;e the Lord had re&s;pect to Abel and his offering, and not to him and his offering, was very wroth, his countenance fell, and at length he cruelly &s;lew his envied bro|ther. Thus the Phari&s;ees hated and per&s;ecuted our Lord long before they laid hold on him: and our Lord mentions being inwardly hated of men, as one kind of per&s;ecution his di&s;ciples were to undergo. This heart enmity (if I may &s;o term it) is the root of all other kinds of per&s;ecution, and is in &s;ome de|gree or other, to be found in the &s;oul of every unre|generated man; and numbers are guilty of this per&s;ecution, who never have it in their power to per&s;ecute any other way. Nay, numbers would be carried out actually to put in practice all other de|grees of per&s;ecution, was not the name of per&s;ecution become odious among&s;t mankind, and did they not hereby run the hazard of lo&s;ing their reputation.
<PB N="82" REF="028079_0079_0FD693DF8DAF95F8">
Alas! how many at the great day, whom we know not now, will be convicted and condemned, that all their life harboured a &s;ecret evil-will again&s;t Zion! They may now &s;creen it before men; but God &s;eeth the enmity of their hearts, and will judge them as per&s;ecutors at the great and terrible day of judgment!</P>
<P>A &s;econd degree of per&s;ecution is that of the tongue; out of the abundance of the heart the mouth &s;peaketh. Many I &s;uppo&s;e think it no harm to &s;hoot out arrows, even bitter words, again&s;t the di&s;ciples of the Lord: they &s;catter the fire-brands, arrows, and death, &s;aying, "Are we not in &s;port?" But, however they may e&s;teem it, in God's account, evil-&s;peaking is a high degree of per&s;ecution. Thus I&s;hmael's mocking I&s;aac in the Old, is termed per|&s;ecuting him in the New Te&s;tament. Ble&s;&s;ed are ye, &s;ays our Lord, when men &s;hall revile you, and per|&s;ecute you, and &s;hall &s;ay all manner of evil again&s;t you fal&s;ely for my name's &s;ake. From whence we may gather, that reviling and &s;peaking all manner of evil fal&s;ely for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, is a high degree of per&s;ecution. For a good name, &s;ays the wi&s;e man, is better than precious ointment, and to many is dearer than life it&s;elf. It is a great breach of the &s;ixth commandment, to &s;lander any one; but to &s;peak evil of and &s;lander the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, merely becau&s;e they are his di&s;ciples, mu&s;t be highly provoking in the &s;ight of God; and &s;uch who are guilty of it (without repentance) will find that Je&s;us Chri&s;t will call them to an account, and puni&s;h them for all their ungodly and hard &s;peeches in a lake of fire and brim&s;tone. This &s;hall be their portion to drink.</P>
<P>The third and la&s;t kind of per&s;ecution, is that which expre&s;&s;es it&s;elf in actions; as when wicked
<PB N="83" REF="028079_0080_0FD693E112F58018">
men &s;eparate the children of God from their com|pany; <HI>ble&s;&s;ed are ye,</HI> &s;ays our Lord, <HI>when they &s;hall &s;eparate you from their company:</HI> or expo&s;e them to church cen&s;ures. <HI>They &s;hall put you out of their &s;yna|gogues;</HI> threatening and prohibiting them from making an open profe&s;&s;ion of his religion or wor&s;hip; or interdicting mini&s;ters for preaching his word, as the high prie&s;ts threatened the apo&s;tles, and forbad them <HI>any more to &s;peak in the name of Je&s;us;</HI> and <HI>Paul breathed out threatenings and &s;laughter again&s;t the di&s;ciples of the Lord:</HI> Or when they call them in|to courts; <HI>you &s;hall be called before governors,</HI> &s;ays our Lord: Or when they fine, impri&s;on, or puni&s;h them, by confi&s;cation of goods, cruel &s;courging, and, la&s;tly, death it&s;elf.</P>
<P>It would be impo&s;&s;ible to enumerate in what va|rious &s;hapes per&s;ecution has appeared. It is a many-headed mon&s;ter, in&s;atiable as hell, cruel as the grave; and, what is wor&s;e, it generally appears under the cloak of religion. But cruel, in&s;atiable, and horrid as it is, they that live godly in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, mu&s;t expect to &s;uffer and encounter with it in all its forms.</P>
<P>This is what we are to make good under our next general head.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> Why is it that godly men mu&s;t expect to &s;uffer per&s;ecution? And,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> This appears from the whole tenour of our Lord's doctrine. We will begin with his divine &s;er|mon on the Mount. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>are they who are per&s;ecuted for righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake; for theirs is the king|dom of heaven.</HI> So that, if our Lord &s;poke truth, we are not &s;o ble&s;&s;ed as to have an intere&s;t in the king|dom of heaven, unle&s;s we are or have been <HI>per&s;e|cuted for righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake.</HI> Nay, our Lord, (it is re|markable) employs three ver&s;es in this beautitude, and only one in each of the others; not only to &s;hew
<PB N="84" REF="028079_0081_0FD693E29EEB3CC8">
that it was a thing which men (as men) are unwil|ling to believe, but al&s;o the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of it upon our being Chri&s;tians. This is likewi&s;e evident from all tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, wherein our Lord informs us, that he came upon the earth, not to &s;end peace but a &s;word; and that the father-in-law &s;hall be again&s;t the mother-in-law, and that a man's foes &s;hall be tho&s;e of his hou&s;ehold. Pa&s;&s;ages, which though confined by fal&s;e prophets to the fir&s;t, I am per&s;uaded will be verified by the experience of all true Chri&s;tians in this, and every age of the church. It would be endle&s;s to recount all the places wherein our Lord forwarns his di&s;ciples that they &s;hould be called before rulers, and thru&s;t out of &s;ynagogues, nay, that the time would come, wherein men &s;hould think they did God &s;ervice to kill them. For this rea&s;on he &s;o frequently declared, that unle&s;s a man <HI>for&s;ake all that he had, and even hated life it&s;elf, he could not be his di&s;ciple.</HI> And therefore it is worthy our ob&s;ervation; that in that remarkable pa&s;&s;age, wherein our Lord makes &s;uch an exten&s;ive promi&s;e to tho&s;e who <HI>left all for him,</HI> he cautiou&s;ly in&s;erts per|&s;ecution. <HI>And Je&s;us an&s;wered and &s;aid, Verily I &s;ay unto you, there is no man that hath left hou&s;e, or breth|ren, or &s;i&s;ters, or father, or mother, or wife, or chil|dren, or lands, for my &s;ake and the go&s;pel's, but he &s;hall receive an hundred fold</HI> now <HI>in this time; hou&s;es and brethren, and &s;i&s;ters and mothers, and children and lands,</HI> with per&s;ecutions; (the word is in the plural num|ber, including all kinds of per&s;ecution) and <HI>in the world to come eternal life.</HI> He that hath ears to hear let him hear what Chri&s;t &s;ays in all the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, and then confe&s;s, that <HI>all who live godly in Chri&s;t, Je&s;us &s;hall &s;uffer per&s;ecution.</HI></P>
<P>As this is proved from our Lord's doctrine, &s;o it is no le&s;s evident from his life. Follow him from

the manager to the cro&s;s, and &s;ee whether any per&s;e|cution was like that which the Son of God, the Lord of glory, underwent whil&s;t here on earth. How was he hated by wicked men? How often would that hatred have excited them to take hold of him, had it not been for fear of the people? How was he re|viled, counted and called a bla&s;phemer, a wine biber, a Samaritan, nay, a devil, and, in one word, had all manner of evil &s;poken again&s;t him fal&s;ely? What contradiction of &s;inners did he endure again&s;t him&s;elf? How did men &s;eparate from his company, and were a&s;hamed to walk with him openly? In&s;o|much that he once &s;aid to his own di&s;ciples, <HI>Will you al&s;o go away?</HI> Again, how was he &s;toned, thru&s;t out of the &s;ynagogues, arrained as a deceiver of the peo|ple, a &s;editious and pe&s;tilent fellow, an enemy to Ce&s;ar, and as &s;uch &s;courged, blindfolded, &s;pit upon, and at length condemned, and nailed to an accur&s;ed tree? Thus was the ma&s;ter per&s;ecuted; thus did the Lord &s;uffer; and the &s;ervant is not above his ma&s;|ter, nor the di&s;ciple above his Lord: <HI>If they have per&s;ecuted me, they will al&s;o per&s;ecute you,</HI> &s;aith the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us. And again, <HI>every man that is perfect,</HI> that is, a true Chri&s;tian, <HI>mu&s;t be as his Ma&s;ter, i. e.</HI> &s;uffer as he did. For all the&s;e things our Lord has let us an example, that we &s;hould follow his &s;teps: and therefore, God forbid that any who would live godly in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, &s;hould hence forward expect to e&s;cape &s;uffering per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>But farther: Not only our Lord's example, but the example of all the &s;aints that ever lived, evi|dently demon&s;trates the truth of the apo&s;tle's a&s;&s;er|tion in the text. How &s;oon was Abel made a martyr for his religion? How was I&s;aac mocked by the &s;on of the bond-woman! And what a large catalogue of &s;uffering Old Te&s;tament &s;aints, have we recorded
<PB N="86" REF="028079_0083_0FD693E5957FEBE8">
in the eleventh chapter of the Hebrews! Read the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, and &s;ee how the Chri&s;tians were threatened, &s;toned, impri&s;oned, &s;courged, and per&s;ecuted even unto death. Examine church-hi&s;|tory in after ages, and you will find the murder of the innocents by Herod, was but an earne&s;t of the innocent blood which &s;hould be &s;hed for the name of Je&s;us. Examine the experience of &s;aints now living on earth; and if it were po&s;&s;ible to con&s;ult the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect, I am per&s;uaded each would concur with the Apo&s;tle in a&s;&s;erting, that <HI>all who will live godly in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, &s;hall &s;uffer per&s;ecution.</HI></P>
<P>How can it be otherwi&s;e in the very nature of things? Ever &s;ince the fall, there has been an irre|concileable enmity between the &s;eed of the woman and the &s;eed of the &s;erpent. Wicked men hate God, and therefore, cannot but hate tho&s;e who are like him: they hate to be reformed, and therefore mu&s;t hate and per&s;ecute tho&s;e who, by a contrary behaviour, te&s;tify of them, that their deeds are evil. Be&s;ides, pride of heart leads men to per&s;ecute the &s;ervants of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. If they commend them, they are afraid of being a&s;ked, <Q>Why do you not follow them?</Q> And therefore becau&s;e they dare not imitate, though they may &s;ometimes be even forced to approve their way, yet pride and envy make them turn per&s;ecutors. Hence it is, that as it was formerly, &s;o it is now, and &s;o will it be to the end of time; he that is born after the fle&s;h the natural man, does and will per&s;ecute him that is born after the Spirit, the regenerate man. Be|cau&s;e Chri&s;tians are not of the world, but Chri&s;t hath cho&s;en them out of the world, therefore the world will hate them. If it be objected again&s;t this doctrine, <Q>that we now live in a Chri&s;tian world,
<PB N="87" REF="028079_0084_0FD693E921C25580">
and therefore mu&s;t not expect &s;uch per&s;ecution as formerly; I an&s;wer, All are not Chri&s;tians that are called &s;o; and, till the heart is changed, the enmity again&s;t God (which is the root of all per&s;ecution) remains,</Q> and con&s;equently Chri&s;|tians, fal&s;ely &s;o called, will per&s;ecute as well as others. I ob&s;erved therefore, in the beginning of this di&s;cour&s;e, that Paul mentions tho&s;e that had a form of religion, as per&s;ons of whom Timothy had need be chiefly aware: for, as our Lord and his Apo&s;tles were mo&s;tly per&s;ecuted by their country|men the Jews, &s;o we mu&s;t expect the like u&s;age from the formali&s;ts of our own nation, the Phari&s;ees, who &s;eem to be religious. For the mo&s;t horrid and bar|barous per&s;ecutions have been carried on by tho&s;e who have called them&s;elves Chri&s;tians; witne&s;s the days of queen Mary; and the fines, bani&s;hments, and impri&s;onments of the children of God in the la&s;t century, and the bitter irreconcileable hatred that appears in thou&s;ands who call them&s;elves Chri&s;|tians, even in the pre&s;ent days wherein we live.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons who argue again&s;t per&s;ecution now, are not &s;ufficiently &s;en&s;ible of the bitter enmity of the heart of every unregenerate man again&s;t God. For my own part, I am &s;o far from wondering that Chri&s;tians are per&s;ecuted, that I wonder our &s;treets do not run with the blood of the &s;aints: was men's power equal to their wills, &s;uch a horrid &s;pectacle would &s;oon appear. But,</P>
<P>Per&s;ecution is nece&s;&s;ary in re&s;pect to the godly them&s;elves. If we have not all manner of evil &s;poken of us, how can we know whether we love contempt, and &s;eek only that honour which cometh from above? If we have not per&s;ecutors, how can our pa&s;&s;ive graces be kept in exerci&s;e? How can many Chri&s;tians precepts be put into practice?

<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> To &s;tand a while and examine them&s;elves. For, by what has been &s;aid, you may gather one mark, whereby you may judge whether you are Chri&s;tians or not. Were you ever per&s;ecuted for Righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake? If not, you never yet lived godly in Chri&s;t our Lord. Whatever you may &s;ay to the contrary, the in&s;pired apo&s;tle, in the words of the text (the truth of which, I think, I have &s;uffi|ciently proved) po&s;itively a&s;&s;erts, that <Q>all that will live godly in him, &s;hall &s;uffer per&s;ecution.</Q> Not that all who are per&s;ecuted are real Chri&s;tians; for many &s;ometimes &s;uffer, and are per&s;ecuted on other accounts than for Righteou&s;ne&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.

You are a&s;hamed of Chri&s;t and his go&s;pel; and in all probability; was he to appear a &s;econd time upon earth, in words, as well as works, you would deny him.

Beg of God to give you his Holy Spirit, that you may &s;ee through, and di&s;cover the latent hypocri&s;y of your hearts, and no longer deceive your own &s;ouls.

<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Are there any true mini&s;ters of Je&s;us Chri&s;t here? You will not be offended if I tell you, that the words of the text are in an e&s;pecial manner applicable to you. St. Paul wrote them to Timothy: and we, of all men, that live godly in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, mu&s;t expect to &s;uffer the &s;evere&s;t per&s;ecution. Satan will endeavour to brui&s;e our hoels, let who will e&s;cape: and it has been the general way of God's providence, in times of per&s;ecution, to permit the &s;hepherds fir&s;t to be &s;mitten, before the &s;heep are &s;cattered. Let us not therefore &s;hew that we are only hirelings, who care not for the &s;heep; but, like the great Shepherd and bi&s;hop of fouls, let us readily lay down our lives for the &s;heep. Whil&s;t others are boa&s;ting of their great preferments, let us rather glory in our great afflictions and per&s;ecutions for the &s;ake of Chri&s;t. St. Paul now rejoices that he &s;uffered afflictions and per&s;ecutions at Iconium and Ly&s;tra: Out of all the Lord delivered him; out of all the Lord will deliver us, and cau&s;e us hereafter to &s;it down with him on thrones, when he comes to judge the twelve tribes of I&s;rael.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="028079_0091_0FD693F78D2A4CE0">
I could proceed; but I am con&s;cious in this part of my di&s;cour&s;e, I ought more particularly to &s;peak to my&s;elf, knowing that Satan has de&s;ired to have me, that he may <HI>&s;ift me as wheat.</HI> I know I mu&s;t (how can it be avoided?) &s;uffer great things for Chri&s;t's name &s;ake. Without a &s;pirit of prophecy, we may ea&s;ily di&s;cern the &s;igns of the times. Per|&s;ecution is even at the doors: The tabernacle of the Lord is already driven into the wilderne&s;s; the ark of the Lord is fallen into the unhallowed hands of uncircumci&s;ed Phili&s;tines. They have long &s;ince put us out of their &s;ynagogues, and high prie&s;ts have been calling on civil magi&s;trates to exert their authority again&s;t the di&s;ciples of the Lord: Men in power have been breathing out threatnings: We may ea&s;ily gue&s;s what will follow, impri&s;onment and &s;laughter. The &s;torm has been gathering &s;ome time; it mu&s;t break &s;hortly. Per|haps it will fall on me fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Brethren therefore whether in the mini&s;try or not, I be&s;eech you, <HI>pray for me,</HI> that I may never &s;uffer ju&s;tly, as an evil-doer, but only for Righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake. Oh! pray that I may not deny my Lord in any wi&s;e, but that I may joyfully follow him, both to pri&s;on and to death, if he is plea&s;ed to call me to &s;eal his truths with my blood. Be not a&s;hamed of Chri&s;t, or of his go&s;pel, though I &s;hould become a pri&s;oner of the Lord. Though I am bound, the word of God will not be bound: No; an open, an effectual door is opened for the preaching the ever|la&s;ting go&s;pel, and men or devils &s;hall never be able to prevail again&s;t it. Only pray, whether it be in life or death, Chri&s;t may be glorified in me: Then I &s;hall rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.</P>

<HEAD>ABRAHAM'S OFFERING UP HIS SON ISAAC.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>GENESIS, xxii. 12.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>And he &s;aid, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him; for now I know that thou feare&s;t God, &s;eeing thou ha&s;t not withheld thy &s;on, thine only &s;on from me.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE great Apo&s;tle Paul, in one of his epi&s;tles, informs us, that <HI>what&s;oever was written afore|time was written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the holy &s;cripture might have hope.</HI> And as without faith it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God, or to be accepted in Je&s;us, the Son of his love; we may be a&s;&s;ured, that whatever in&s;tances of a more than common faith are recorded in the book of God, they were more immediately de&s;igned by the Holy Spirit for our learning and imitation, upon whom the ends of the world are come. For this rea&s;on, the author of the epi&s;tle to the Hebrews, in the eleventh chapter, mentions a noble catalogue of Old Te&s;tament &s;aints and martyrs, <Q>who &s;ub|dued kingdoms, wrought righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;topped the mouths of lions, &amp;c. and are gone before us to inherit the promi&s;es.</Q> A &s;ufficient confutation, I think, of their error, who lightly e&s;teem the Old
<PB N="98" REF="028079_0095_0FD694036FB58810">
Te&s;tament &s;aints, and would not have them men|tioned to Chri&s;tians, as per&s;ons who&s;e faith and patience we are called upon more immediately to follow. If this was true, the apo&s;tle would never have produced &s;uch a cloud of witne&s;&s;es out of the Old Te&s;tament, to excite the Chri&s;tians of the fir&s;t, and con&s;equently pure&s;t age of the church, to con|tinue &s;tedfa&s;t and unmoveable in the profe&s;&s;ion of their faith. Amid&s;t this catalogue of &s;aints, me|thinks, the patriarch Abraham &s;hines the brighte&s;t, and differs from the others, as one &s;tar differeth from another &s;tar in glory; for he &s;hone with &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hed lu&s;tre, that he was called the <HI>Friend of God,</HI> the <HI>Father of the Faithful;</HI> and tho&s;e who be|lieve on Chri&s;t, are &s;aid to be &s;ons and daughters of, and to be ble&s;&s;ed, with faithful Abraham. Many trials of his faith did God &s;end this great and good man, after he had commanded him to get out from his country, and from his kindred, unto a land which he &s;hould &s;hew him; but the la&s;t was the mo&s;t &s;evere of all; I mean that of offering up his only &s;on. This, by the divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I propo&s;e to make the &s;ubject of your pre&s;ent meditation, and, by way of conclu&s;ion, to draw &s;ome practical inferences, as God &s;hall enable me, from this in&s;tructive &s;tory.</P>
<P>The &s;acred penman begins the narrative thus; ver&s;e 1. <HI>And it came to pa&s;s, after the&s;e things, God did tempt Abraham. After the&s;e things,</HI> that is, after he had underwent many &s;evere trials before, after he was old, full of days, and might flatter him&s;elf perhaps, that the troubles and toils of life were now fini&s;hed; <Q>after the&s;e things, God did tempt Abra|ham.</Q> Chri&s;tians, you know not what trials you may meet with before you die: notwith&s;tanding you may have &s;uffered, and been tried much already, yet, it may be, a greater mea&s;ure is &s;till behind,
<PB N="99" REF="028079_0096_0FD694044AD64AC0">
which you are to fill up. "Be not high-minded, but fear." Our la&s;t trials, in all probability, will be the greate&s;t: and we can never &s;ay our warfare is accompli&s;hed, or our trials fini&s;hed, till we bow down our heads, and give up the gho&s;t. <Q>And it came to pa&s;s, after the&s;e things, that God did tempt Abraham.</Q></P>
<P>"God did tempt Abraham." But can the &s;crip|ture contradict it&s;elf? Does not the apo&s;tle James tell us, that God tempts no man; and God does tempt no man to evil, or on purpo&s;e to draw him into &s;in; for, when a man is thus tempted, he is drawn away of his own heart's lu&s;t, and enticed. But in another &s;en&s;e, God may be &s;aid to tempt, I mean, to try his &s;ervants; and in this &s;en&s;e we are to under&s;tand that pa&s;&s;age of Matthew, where we are told, that <Q>Je&s;us was led up by the Spirit (the good Spirit) into the wilderne&s;s, to be tempted of the devil.</Q> And our Lord, in that excellent form of prayer which he has been plea&s;ed to give us, does not require us to pray that we may not ab&s;o|lutely be led into temptation, but delivered from the evil of it; whence we may plainly infer, that God &s;ees it fit &s;ometimes to lead us into temptation, that is, to bring us into &s;uch circum&s;tances as will try our faith, and other Chri&s;tian graces. In this &s;en&s;e we are to under&s;tand the expre&s;&s;ion before us, God did tempt or try Abraham."</P>
<P>How God was plea&s;ed to reveal his will at this time to his faithful &s;ervant, whether by the Shechi|nah, or divine appearance, or by a &s;mall &s;till voice, as he &s;poke to Elijah, or by a whi&s;per, like that of the Spirit to Philip, when he commanded him to join him&s;elf to the Eunuch's chariot, we are not told, nor is it material to enquire. It is enough that we are informed, God &s;aid unto him, Abra|ham;

and tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Abraham knew it was the voice of God: for, "he &s;aid, behold, here I am." O what a holy familiarity (if I may &s;o &s;peak) is there between God and tho&s;e holy &s;ouls that are united to him by faith in Chri&s;t Je&s;us! God &s;ays, Abraham: and Abraham &s;aid, (it &s;hould &s;eem without the lea&s;t &s;ur|pri&s;e) "Behold, here I am," being reconciled to God by the death and obedience of Chri&s;t, which he rejoiced in, and &s;aw by faith afar off; he did not, like guilty Adam, &s;eek the trees of the garden to hide him&s;elf from, but takes plea&s;ure in conver|&s;ing with God, and talketh with him, as a man talketh with his friend. O that CHIRIST-le&s;s &s;in|ners knew what it is to have fellow&s;hip with the Father and the Son? They would envy the happi|ne&s;s of &s;aints, and count it all joy to be termed enthu&s;ia&s;ts and fools for Chri&s;t's &s;ake.</P>
<P>But what does God &s;ay unto Abraham; Ver. 3. <Q>Take now thy &s;on, thine only &s;on I&s;aac, whom thou love&s;t, and get thee into the land of Moriah, and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I &s;hall tell thee of.</Q></P>
<P>Every word de&s;erves our particular ob&s;ervation. Whatever he was to do, he mu&s;t do it now, imme|diately, without conferring with fle&s;h and blood.

But this is not all: It mu&s;t not only be a &s;on, but <HI>thine only &s;on I&s;aac, whom thou love&s;t.</HI> If it mu&s;t be a &s;on, and not a bea&s;t, that mu&s;t be offered, why will not I&s;h|mael do, the &s;on of the bond-woman?

<P>Well might the apo&s;tle, &s;peaking of this man of God, &s;ay, that <HI>again&s;t hope he believed in hope, and, being &s;trong in faith, gave glory to God:</HI> For, had he not been ble&s;&s;ed with faith which man never before bad, he mu&s;t have refu&s;ed to comply with this &s;evere command. For how many arguments might nature &s;ugge&s;t, to prove that &s;uch a command could never come from God, or to excu&s;e him&s;elf from obeying it? <Q>What! (might the good man have &s;aid) butcher my child! it is contrary to the very law of nature: Much more to butcher my dear &s;on I&s;aac, in who&s;e &s;eed God him&s;elf has a&s;&s;ured me, that all the families of the earth &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed. But &s;uppo&s;ing I could give up my own affections, and be willing to part with him, though I love him &s;o dearly, yet, if I murder him, what will become of God's promi&s;e? Be&s;ides I am now like a city built upon a hill; I &s;hine as a light in the world, in the mid&s;t of a crooked and perver&s;e ge|neration: How then &s;hall I cau&s;e God's name to be bla&s;phemed, how &s;hall I become a by-word among the heathen, if they hear that I have com|mitted a crime which they abhor! But, above all, what will Sarah my wife &s;ay? How can I ever return to her again, after I have imbrued my hands in my dear child's blood? O that God would parden me in this thing, or take my life in the place of my &s;on's!</Q> Thus, I &s;ay, Abraham
<PB N="102" REF="028079_0099_0FD628ACB78735C0">
might have argued, and that too &s;eemingly with great rea&s;on, again&s;t complying with the divine command. But, as before by faith he con&s;idered not the deadne&s;s of Sarah's womb, when &s;he was pa&s;t age, but believed on him, who &s;aid, <Q>Sarah thy wife &s;hall bear thee a &s;on indeed;</Q> &s;o now being convinced that the &s;ame God &s;poke to and commanded him to offer up that &s;on, and knowing that God was able to rai&s;e him from the dead, with|out delay he obeys the heavenly call.</P>
<P>O that unbelievers would learn of faithful Abra|ham, and believe whatever is revealed from God, though they cannot fully comprehend it! Abraham knew God commanded him to offer up his &s;on, and therefore believed, notwith&s;tanding carnal rea&s;oning might &s;ugge&s;t many objections. We have &s;ufficient te&s;timony, that God has &s;poken to us by his Son; why &s;hould we not al&s;o believe, though many things in the New Te&s;tament are above our rea&s;on? For, where rea&s;on ends, faith begins. And, however infidels may &s;tyle them&s;elves rea&s;oners, of all men they are the mo&s;t unrea&s;onable: For is it not con|trary to all rea&s;on, to mea&s;ure an infinite by a finite under&s;tanding, or think to find out the my&s;teries of godline&s;s to perfection?</P>
<P>But to return to the patriarch Abraham: We ob|&s;erved before what plau&s;ible objections he might have made; but he an&s;wered not a &s;ingle word: No, without replying again&s;t his Maker, we are told, ver. 3. that <Q>Abraham ro&s;e up early in the morning, and &s;addled his a&s;s, and took two of his young men with him, and I&s;aac his &s;on, and clave the wood for the burnt-offering, and ro&s;e up and went unto the place of which God had told him.</Q></P>
<P>From this ver&s;e we may gather, that God &s;poke to Abraham in a dream, or vi&s;ion of the night: For
<PB N="103" REF="028079_0100_0FD69448D5212E00">
it is &s;aid, he <HI>ro&s;e up early.</HI> Perhaps it was near the fourth watch of the night, ju&s;t before break of day, when God &s;aid, <HI>Take now thy &s;on;</HI> and Abraham ri&s;es up early to do &s;o; as I doubt not but he u&s;ed to ri&s;e up early to offer up his morning-&s;acrifice of prai&s;e and thank&s;giving. It is often remarked of people in the Old Te&s;tament, that they ro&s;e early in the morning; and particularly of our Lord in the New, that he ro&s;e a great while before day to pray. The morning befriends devotion; and if people cannot u&s;e &s;o much &s;elf-deniel as to ri&s;e early to pray, I know not how they will be able to die as a &s;take (if called to it) for Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The humility, as well as piety of the patriarch, is ob&s;ervable: He &s;addled his own a&s;s (great men &s;hould be humble;) and to &s;hew his &s;incerity, though he took two of his young men with him, and I&s;aac his &s;on, ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> he keeps his de&s;ign as a &s;ecret from them all: Nay, he does not &s;o much as tell Sarah his wife: For he knew not but &s;he might be a &s;nare unto him in this affair; and, as Rebeccah afterwards, on another occa&s;ion, advi&s;ed Jacob to flee, &s;o Sarah al&s;o might per&s;uade I&s;aac to hide him&s;elf; or the young men, had they known of it, might have for|ced him away, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> after-ages the &s;oldiers re&s;cued Jonathan out of the hands of Saul. But Abraham &s;ought no &s;uch eva&s;ion, and therefore, like an I&s;ra|elite indeed, in whom there was no guile, he him&s;elf re&s;olutely <Q>clave the wood for the burnt-offering, ro&s;e up and went unto the place of which God had told him.</Q> In the &s;econd Ver&s;e, God com|manded him to offer up his &s;on upon one of the mountains which he would tell him of. He com|manded him to offer his &s;on up, but would not then directly tell him the place where: This was to keep him dependent and watching unto prayer: For

there's nothing like being kept waiting upon God; and, if we do, a&s;&s;uredly God will reveal him&s;elf unto us yet further in his own time. Let us prac|ti&s;e what we know, follow providence &s;o far as we can &s;ee already; and what we know not, what we &s;ee not as yet, let us only be found in the way of duty, and the Lord will reveal even that unto us. Abraham knew not directly where he was to offer up his &s;on; but he ri&s;es up and &s;ets forward, and behold now God &s;hews him; and he went to the place of which God had told him. Let us go and do likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>Ver. 4. Then on the third day, Abraham lift up his eyes, and &s;aw the place afar off.</P>
<P>So that the place, of which God had told him, was no le&s;s than three days journey di&s;tant from the place where God fir&s;t appeared to him, and com|manded him to take his &s;on. Was not this to try his faith, and to let him &s;ee that what he did, was not merely from a &s;udden pang of devotion, but a mat|ter of choice and deliberation? But who can tell what the aged patriarch felt during the&s;e three days? Strong as he was in faith, I am per&s;uaded his bow|els often yearned over his dear &s;on I&s;aac. Methinks I &s;ee the good old man walking with his dear child in his hand, and now and then looking upon him, loving him, and then turning a&s;ide to weep. And perhaps, &s;ometimes he &s;tays a little behind to pout out his heart before God; for he had no mortal to tell his ca&s;e to. Then, methinks, I &s;ee him join his &s;on and &s;ervants again, and talking to him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the things pertaining to the kingdom of God, as they walked by the way. At length, on the third day, he lift up his eyes, and &s;aw the place afar off. And, to &s;hew that he was yet &s;incerely re&s;olved to do what&s;oever the Lord required of him, he even
<PB N="105" REF="028079_0102_0FD6944ADF6E0158">
now will not di&s;cover his de&s;ign to his &s;ervants, but &s;aid, ver. 5. in his young men, (as we &s;hould &s;ay to our worldly thoughts when about to tread the courts of the Lord's home) <Q>Abide ye here with the a&s;s; and I and the lad will go up yonder, and wor&s;hip, and come again to you.</Q> This was a &s;ufficient rea|&s;on for their &s;taying behind; and, it being their ma&s;|ter's cu&s;tom to go frequently to wor&s;hip, they could have no &s;u&s;picion of what he was going about. And by Abraham's &s;aying, that he and the lad would come again, I am apt to think he believed God would rai&s;e him from the dead, if &s;o be he permitted him to offer his child up for a burnt-offering. However that be, he is yet re&s;olved to obey God to the utter|mo&s;t; and therefore,</P>
<P>Ver. 6. <Q>Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering, and laid it upon I&s;aac his &s;on; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife, and they went both of them together.</Q> Little did I&s;aac think that he was to be offered on that very wood which he was carrying upon his &s;houlders; and therefore, ver. 7. I&s;aac innocently, and with a holy freedom (for good men &s;hould not keep their children at too great a di&s;tance) &s;pake unto Abraham his father, and &s;aid, My father; and he (with equal affection and holy conde&s;cen&s;ion) &s;aid, Here am I, my &s;on. And to &s;hew how careful Abraham had been (as all chri&s;tian parents ought to be) to in&s;truct his I&s;aac how to &s;acrifice to God, like a youth train|ed up in the way wherein he &s;hould go; I&s;aac &s;aid, Behold the fire and the wood; but where is the lamb for a burnt-offering? How beautiful is early piety! How amiable, to hear young people a&s;k que&s;tions about &s;acrificing to God in an acceptable way! I&s;aac knew very well that a lamb was want|ing, and that a lamb was nece&s;&s;ary for a proper

&s;acrifice: Behold the fire and the wood; but where is the lamb for a burnt-offering? Young men and maidens, learn or him.</P>
<P>Hitherto, it is plain, I&s;aac knew nothing of his father's de&s;ign: But I believe by what his father &s;aid in an&s;wer to his que&s;tion, that now was the time Abraham revealed it unto him.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 8. <Q>And Abraham &s;aid, My &s;on, God will provide him&s;elf a lamb for a burnt-offering.</Q> Some think that Abraham by faith &s;aw the Lord Je&s;us afar off, and here &s;pake prophetically of that Lamb of God already &s;lain in decree, and hereafter to be actually offered up for &s;inners. This was a lamb of God's providing indeed) we dared not have thought of it) to &s;atisfy his own ju&s;tice, and to ren|der him ju&s;t in ju&s;tifying the ungodly. What is all our fire and wood, the be&s;t preparation and perform|ances we can make or pre&s;ent, unle&s;s God had pro|vided him&s;elf this Lamb for a burnt offering? He could not away with them. The words will well bear this interpretation. But, whatever Abraham might intend, I cannot but think he here made an application, and acquainted his &s;on of God's dealing with his &s;oul; and at length, with tears in his eyes, and the utmo&s;t affection in his heart, cried out, <Q>Thou art to be the lamb, my &s;on; God has com|manded me to provide thee for a burnt-offering, and to offer thee upon the mountain which we are now a&s;cending.</Q> And, as it appears from a &s;ub&s;equent ver&s;e, I&s;aac, convinced that it was the divine will, made no re&s;i&s;tance at all: for it is &s;aid, "they went both of them together;" and again, ver&s;e 9, when we are told that Abraham bound I&s;aac, we do not hear of his complaining or endeavouring to e&s;cape, which he might have done, being (as &s;ome think) near thirty years of age, and it is plain,
<PB N="107" REF="028079_0104_0FD6944C59B613B8">
capable enough for carrying wood enough for a burnt-offering. But he was partaker of the like precious faith with his aged father, and therefore is as willing to be offered, as Abraham is to offer him: and &s;o they went both of them together.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 6. At length <Q>they came to the place of which God had told Abraham. He built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound I&s;aac his &s;on, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.</Q></P>
<P>And here let us pau&s;e awhile, and by faith take a view of the place where the father has laid him. I doubt not but the ble&s;&s;ed angels hovered round the altar and &s;ang, Glory be to God in the highe&s;t, for giving &s;uch faith to man. Come, all ye tender|hearted parents, who know what it is to look over a dying child: Fancy that you &s;aw the altar erected before you, and the wood laid in order, and the be|loved I&s;aac bound upon it: Fancy that you &s;aw the aged parent &s;tanding by weeping. (For, why may we not &s;uppo&s;e that Abraham wept, &s;ince Je&s;us him|&s;elf wept at the grave of Lazarus?) O what pious, endearing expre&s;&s;ions pa&s;&s;ed now alternately between the father and the &s;on! Jo&s;ephus records a pathetic &s;peech made by each, whether genuine I know not: but methinks I &s;ee the tears trickle down the patri|arch Abraham's cheeks; and, out of the abundance of the heart, he cries, Adieu, adieu, my &s;on; the Lord gave thee to me, and the Lord calls thee away; ble&s;&s;ed be the name of the Lord: adieu, my I&s;aac, my only &s;on, whom I love as my own &s;oul; adieu, adieu. I &s;ee I&s;aac at the &s;ame time meekly re&s;igning him&s;elf into his heavenly Father's hands, and pray|ing to the mo&s;t High to &s;trengthen his earthly parent to &s;trike the &s;troke. But why do I attempt to de|&s;cribe what either &s;on or father felt? It is impo&s;&s;ible:

<P>And now, ver. 10. The fatal blow is going to be given. <Q>And Abraham &s;tretched forth his hand, and took the knife to &s;lay his &s;on.</Q> But do you not think he intended to turn away his head, when he gave the blow? Nay, why may we not &s;uppo&s;e be &s;ometimes drew his hand in, after it was &s;tretched out, willing to take another la&s;t farewel of his be|loved I&s;aac, and de&s;irous to defer it a little, though re&s;olved at la&s;t to &s;trike home? Be that as it will, his arm is now &s;tretched out, the knife is in his hand, and he is about to put it to his dear &s;on's throat.</P>
<P>But &s;ing, O heavens! and rejoice, O earth! Man's extremity is God's opportunity: for behold, ju&s;t as the knife, in all probability, was near his throat, ver. 11. <Q>the angel of the Lord, (or rather, the Lord of angels, Je&s;us Chri&s;t. the angel of the everla&s;ting covenant) called unto him, (probably in a very audible manner) from heaven, and &s;aid, Abraham, Abraham. (The word is doubled to engage his attention; and perhaps the &s;uddenne&s;s of the call made him draw back his hand, ju&s;t as he was going to &s;trike his &s;on.) And Abraham &s;aid, Here am I,</Q></P>
<P>And he &s;aid, ver&s;e 12. <Q>Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now know I that thou feare&s;t God, &s;ee|ing thou ha&s;t not withheld thy &s;on, thine only &s;on from me.</Q></P>
<P>Here then it was that Abraham received his &s;on I&s;aac from the dead in a figure. He was in effect offered upon the altar, and God looked upon him as
<PB N="109" REF="028079_0106_0FD6944DCBE8DBD0">
offered and given unto him. Now it was that Abraham's faith; being tried, was found more precious than gold purified &s;even times in the fire. Now as a reward of grace, though not of debt, for this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> act of obedience, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> God gives and confirms the promi&s;e, <Q>that in his &s;eed all the nations in the earth &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed,</Q> ver&s;e 17. 18. With what com|fort may we &s;uppo&s;e the good old man and his &s;on went down from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and returned unto the young men! With what joy we imagine he went home, and related all that had pa&s;&s;ed to Sarah!

<P>But let us now drew our eyes from the crea|ture, and do what Abraham, if he was pre&s;ent, would direct to; I mean, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> them on the Crea|tor, God ble&s;&s;ed for evermore.</P>
<P>I &s;ee your hearts affected, I &s;ee your eyes weep, (and indeed, who can refrain weeping at the relation of &s;uch a &s;tory?) But, behold, I &s;hew you a my&s;tery hid under the &s;acrifice of Abra|ham's only &s;on, which, unle&s;s your hearts are hardened, mu&s;t cau&s;e you to weep tears of love, and that plentifully too. I would willingly hope you even prevent me here, and are ready to &s;ay, <Q><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it is the love of God, in giving Je&s;us Chri&s;t to die for our &s;ins.

convince you, that we are fallen creatures, and that we do not love God or Chri&s;t as we ought to do: for, if you admire Abraham offering up his I&s;aac, how much more ought you to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and adore the love of God, who &s;o loved the world, as to give his only begotten Son, Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord, <Q>that who&s;oever believ|eth on him &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;t|ing life;</Q> May we not well cry out Now know we, O Lord, that thou ha&s;t loved us, &s;ince thou ha&s;t not withheld thy Son, thine only &s;on from us? Abraham was God's creature (and God was Abraham's friend) and therefore under the highe&s;t obligation to &s;urrender up his I&s;aac. But, O &s;tu|pendous love! Whil&s;t we were his enemies, God &s;ent forth his Son made of a woman, made under the law, that he might become a cur&s;e for us. O the freene&s;s, as well as the infinity, of the love of God our Father! It is un&s;earchable: I am lo&s;t in contemplating it; it is pa&s;t finding out. Think, O believers, think of the love of God, in giving Je&s;us Chri&s;t to be a propitiation for our &s;ins. And when you hear how Abraham built as altar, and laid the wood in order, and bound I&s;aac his &s;ea, and laid him on the altar upon the wood; think how your heavenly Father bound Je&s;us Chri&s;t his only Son, and offered him upon the altar of his ju&s;tice, and laid upon him the ini|quities of us all. When you read of Abraham's &s;tretching forth his hand to &s;lay his &s;on, think, O think, how God actually &s;uffered his Son to be &s;lain, that we might live for evermore. Do you read of I&s;aac carrying the wood upon his &s;houlders, upon which he was to be offered. Let this lead you to Mount Calvary, (this very mount of Moriah, where I&s;aac was offered, as

&s;ome think) and take a view of the antitype Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that Son of God, bearing and rea|dy to &s;ink under the weight of that cro&s;s on which he was to hang for us. Do you admire I&s;aac &s;o freely con&s;enting to die, though a crea|ture, and therefore obliged to go when God called? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> do not forget to admire infinitely more the dear Lord Je&s;us, that promi&s;ed &s;eed, who willingly &s;aid, "Lo, I come," though un|der no obligation &s;o to do, "to do thy will," to obey and die for men, O God! Did you weep ju&s;t now, when I bid you fancy that you &s;aw the altar, and the wood laid in order, and I&s;aac laid bound on the altar? Look up by faith, behold the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, our all-glorious Imma|nuel, not bound, but nailed on an accur&s;ed tree: &s;ee how he hangs crowned with thorns, and had in deri&s;ion of all that are round about him: &s;ee how the thorns pierce him, and how the blood in purple &s;treams trickles down his &s;acred temples! Hark how the God of nature groans! See how he bows his head, and at length humanity gives up the gho&s;t! I&s;aac is &s;aved, but Je&s;us, the God of I&s;aac, dies; a ram is offered up in I&s;aac's room, but Je&s;us has no &s;ub&s;titute; Je&s;us mu&s;t bleed, Je&s;us mu&s;t die: God the Father provided this Lamb for him&s;elf from all eternity. He mu&s;t be offered in time, or man mu&s;t be damned for ever|more. And now where are all your tears? Shall I &s;ay, refrain your voice from weeping? No, ra|ther let me exhort you to look to him whom you have pierced, and mourn, as a women mourneth for her fir&s;t-born: for we have been the betrayers, we have been the murderers of this Lord of glory; and &s;hall we not bewail tho&s;e &s;ins, which brought &s;he ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us to the accur&s;ed tree? Having

&s;o much done, &s;o much &s;uffered for us, &s;o much forgiven, &s;hall we not love much? O! let us love him with all our hearts, and minds, and &s;trength, and glorify him in our &s;ouls and bodies; for they are his. Which leads me to a &s;econd in|ference I &s;hall draw from the foregoing di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>From hence we may learn the nature of true ju&s;tifying faith. Whoever under&s;tands and preach|es the truth as it is in Je&s;us, mu&s;t acknowledge, that &s;alvation is God's free gift, and that we are &s;aved, not by any or all the works of righteou&s;ne&s;s which we have done or can do: no; we can nei|ther wholly nor in part ju&s;tify our&s;elves in the &s;ight of God. The Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is our righteou&s;|ne&s;s; and if we are accepted with God, it mu&s;t be only in and through the per&s;onal righteou&s;ne&s;s, the active and pa&s;&s;ive obedience of Je&s;us Chri&s;t his beloved Son. This righteou&s;ne&s;s mu&s;t be im|puted, or counted over to us, and applied by &s;aith to our hearts, or el&s;e we can in no wi&s;e be ju&s;tified in God's &s;ight: and that very moment a &s;inner is enabled to &s;ay hold on Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s by faith, he is freely ju&s;tified from all his &s;ins, and &s;hall never enter into condemnation, notwith&s;tand|ing he was a fire-brand of hell before. Thus it was that Abraham was ju&s;tified before he did any good work: he was enabled to believe on the Lord Chri&s;t; it was accounted to him for righ|teou&s;ne&s;s; that is, Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s was made over to him, and &s;o accounted his. This, this is go&s;pel; this is the only way of finding acceptance with God: good works have nothing to do with our ju&s;tification in his &s;ight. We are ju&s;tified by faith alone, as &s;aith the article of our church; agreeable to which the apo&s;tle Paul &s;ays, <Q>By grace ye are &s;aved, through faith, and that not
<PB N="113" REF="028079_0110_0FD69452B053DF38">
of your&s;elves; it is the gift of God.</Q> Not|with&s;tanding good works have their proper place: they ju&s;tify our faith, though not our per&s;ons: they follow it, and evidence our ju&s;tification in in the &s;ight of men. Hence it is that the apo&s;tle James a&s;ks, was not Abraham ju&s;tified by works (alluding no doubt to the &s;tory on which we have been di&s;cour&s;ing) that is, did he not prove he was in a ju&s;tified &s;tate, becau&s;e his faith was pro|ductive of good works? This declarative ju&s;tifica|tion in the &s;ight of men, is what is directly to be under&s;tood in the words of the text: "Now know I," &s;ays God, <Q>that thou feare&s;t me, &s;ince thou ha&s;t not withheld thy &s;on, thine only &s;on from me.</Q> Not but that God knew it before; but this is &s;poken in conde&s;cen&s;ion to our weak capa|cities, and plainly &s;hews, that his offering up his &s;on was accepted with God, as an evidence of the &s;incerity of his faith, and for this, was left on record to future ages. Hence then you may learn whether you are ble&s;&s;ed with, and are &s;ons and daughters of faithful Abraham. You &s;ay you be|lieve; you talk of free grace, and free ju&s;tification: you do well; the devils al&s;o believe and tremble. But has the faith which you pretend to, influenced your hearts, renewed your &s;ouls, and, like Abra|ham's worked by love? Are your affections, like his, &s;et on things above? Are you heavenly-minded, and like him, do you confe&s;s your&s;elves &s;trangers and pilgrims on the earth. In &s;hort, has your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> enabled you to overcome the world, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> you to give up your I&s;aacs, your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, your mo&s;t beloved lu&s;ts, friends, plea|&s;ure, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> for God?

loved of him.</Q> But if you are only talking believers, have only a faith of the head, and never felt the power of it in your hearts, however you may bol&s;ter your&s;elves up, and &s;ay, <Q>we have Abraham for our father, or Chri&s;t is our Savi|our;</Q> unle&s;s you get a faith of the heart, a faith working by love, you &s;hall never &s;it with Abraham, I&s;aac, Jacob, or Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in the kingdom of heaven.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t draw one more inference, and with that I &s;hall conclude.</P>
<P>Learn, O &s;aints! from what has been &s;aid, to fit loo&s;e to all your worldly comforts; and &s;tand really prepared to part with every thing, when God &s;hall require it at your hand. Some of you, perhaps, may have friends, who are to you as your own &s;ouls, and others may have children, in who&s;e lives your own lives are bound up: all I believe have their I&s;aacs, their particular delights of &s;ome kind or other. Labour, for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, labour, ye &s;ons and daughters of Abraham, to re|&s;ign them, daily in affection to God, that, when he &s;hall require you really to &s;acrifice them, you may not confer with fle&s;h and blood, any more than the ble&s;&s;ed patriarch now before us. And as for you that have been in any mea&s;ure tried like unto him, let his example encourage and comfort you. Remember, Abraham your father was tried &s;o before you: think, O think, of the happine&s;s he now enjoys, and how he is ince&s;&s;antly thanking God for tempting and trying him when here below. Look up often by the eye of faith, and &s;ee him &s;itting with his dearly beloved I&s;aac in the world of &s;pirits. Remember, it will be but a little while, and you &s;hall &s;it with them al&s;o, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ell one another what God has done for your

<Q><HI>But Saul increa&s;ed the more in &s;trength, and confound|ed the Jews which dwelt at Dama&s;cus, proving that this is very Chri&s;t.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is an undoubted truth, however it may &s;eem a paradox to natural men, that <Q>who&s;oever will live godly in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, &s;hall &s;uffer per|&s;ecution.</Q> And therefore it is very remarkable, that our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, in his glorious &s;ermon on the Mount, after he had been pronouncing tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed, who were poor in &s;pirit, meek, pure in heart, and &s;uch like, immediately adds, (and &s;pends no le&s;s than three ver&s;es in this beatitude) <Q>Ble&s;&s;ed are they who are per&s;ecuted for righte|ou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake.</Q> No one ever was or ever will be endowed with the forementioned graces in any degree, but he will be per&s;ecuted for it in a mea&s;ure. There is an irreconcileable enmity be|tween the &s;eed of the woman, and the &s;eed of the &s;erpent. And if we are not of the world, but &s;hew by our fruits that we are of the number of tho&s;e whom Je&s;us Chri&s;t has cho&s;en out of the world, for that very rea&s;on the world will hate us. As this is true of every particular Chri&s;tian, &s;o it
<PB N="117" REF="028079_0114_0FD6945850858DA0">
is true of every Chri&s;tian church in general. For &s;ome years pa&s;t we have heard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t little of a public per&s;ecution: why? Becau&s;e but little of the power of godline&s;s has prevailed among&s;t all determinati|ons. The &s;trong man armed has had fall po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of mo&s;t profe&s;&s;ors' hearts, and therefore he has let them re&s;t in a fal&s;e peace. But we may a&s;&s;ure our&s;elves, when Je&s;us Chri&s;t begins to gather in his elect in any remarkable manner, and opens an effectual door for preaching the everla&s;ting go&s;pel, per&s;ecution will flame out, and Satan <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> his emi&s;&s;aries will do their utmo&s;t (though in vain) to &s;top the work of God. Thus it was in the fir&s;t ages, thus it is in our days, and thus it will be till time &s;hall be no more.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tians, and Chri&s;tian churches mu&s;t then expect enemies. Our chief concern &s;hould be, to learn how to behave towards them in a Chri&s;tian manner: for unle&s;s we take good heed to our&s;elves, we &s;hall embitter our &s;pirits, and act unbecoming the followers of that Lord, <Q>who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he &s;uffered, threatened not; and as a lamb before his &s;hear|ers is dumb, &s;o opened he not his mouth.</Q> But what motive &s;hall we make u&s;e of to bring our|&s;elves to this ble&s;&s;ed Lamb-like temper? Next to the immediate operation of the Holy Spirit upon our hearts, I know of no con&s;ideration <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> con|ducive to teach us long-&s;uffering towards <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> mo&s;t bitter per&s;ecutors, than this, <Q>That, for all that we know to the contrary, &s;ome of tho&s;e very per&s;ons, who are now per&s;ecuting, may be cho|&s;en from all eternity by God, and hereafter called in time, to edify and build up the church of Chri&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>The per&s;ecutor Saul, mentioned in the words
<PB N="118" REF="028079_0115_0FD6941B5235BE40">
of the text, (and who&s;e conver&s;ion, God willing. I propo&s;e to treat on in the following di&s;cour&s;e) is a noble in&s;tance of this kind.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, a per&s;ecutor, and that a bloody one: for &s;ee how he is introduced in the beginning of this chapter: <Q>and Saul yet breathing out threatenings and &s;laughter again&s;t the di&s;ciples of our Lord, went unto the high prie&s;t, and de&s;ired of him letters to Dama&s;cus to the &s;ynagogues, that if he found any of THIS WAY, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound to Jeru&s;alem.</Q></P>
<P>"And Saul yet breathing out." This implies that he had been a per&s;ecutor before. To prove which, we need only look back to the &s;eventh chapter, where we &s;hall find him &s;o very remark|ably active at Stephen's death, that the <Q>witne&s;|&s;es laid down their clothes at a young man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> feet, who&s;e name was Saul.</Q> He &s;eems, though young, to be in &s;ome authority. Perhaps, for his zeal again&s;t the Chri&s;tians, he was preferred in the church, and was allowed to &s;it in the great council or &s;anhedrim: for we are told, chap. viii. ver. 1. "That Saul was con&s;enting unto his death:" and again, at ver. 3. he is brought in as exceeding all in his oppo&s;ition; for thus &s;peaks the evangeli&s;t <Q>as for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every hou&s;e, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">aling men and women, committed them to pri&s;on.</Q> One would have imagined, that this &s;hould have &s;atis|fied, at lea&s;t abated the fury of this young zealot. No: being exceedingly mad again&s;t them, as he him&s;elf informs Agrippa, and having made havock of all in Jeru&s;alem, he now is re&s;olved to per&s;e|cute the di&s;ciples of the Lord, even to &s;trange cities; and therefore yet breathing out threatening.
<PB N="119" REF="028079_0116_0FD6945B9BC66D88">
"Breathing out." The words are very empha|tical, and expre&s;&s;ive of his bitter enmity. It was as natural to him now to threaten the Chri&s;tians, as it was for him to breathe: he could &s;carce &s;peak, but it was &s;ome threatenings again&s;t them. Nay, he not only breathed one threatenings, but &s;laugh|ters al&s;o, (and tho&s;e who threaten, would al&s;o &s;laughter, if it were in their power) again&s;t the di&s;ciples of the Lord. In&s;atiable therefore as hell, finding he could not refu&s;e or &s;top the Chri&s;tians by force of argument, he is re&s;olved to do it by force of arms; and therefore went to the high prie&s;t (foe there never was a per&s;ecution yet without a high prie&s;t at the head of it) and de&s;ired of him letters, i&s;&s;ued out of his &s;piritual court, to the &s;ynagogues or eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts at Dama&s;cus, giving him authority, <Q>that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jeru&s;alem,</Q> I &s;uppo&s;e to be arraigned and condemned in the high prie&s;t's court. Ob&s;erve how be &s;peaks of the Chri&s;tians. Luke, who wrote the Acts, calls them di&s;ciples of the Lord. And Saul &s;tiles then men and women of this way. I doubt not but he repre&s;ented them as a company of up&s;tart enthu&s;ia&s;ts, that had lately gotten into a new method or way of living; that would not be content with the temple-&s;ervice, but they mo&s;t be righteous over-much, and have their private meetings of conventicler<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">; and break bread, as they called it, from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, to the great di&s;turbance of the e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy, and to the utter &s;ubver&s;ion of all order and decency. I do not hear that the high prie&s;t makes any objection: no, he was as willing to grant letters, as Saul was to a&s;k them; and wonderfully plea&s;ed within him&s;elf, to find he had &s;uch an active zealot to employ again&s;t the Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="028079_0117_0FD6941F0A3DBC10">
Well then, a judicial proce&s;s is immediately i&s;|&s;ued out, with the high prie&s;t's &s;eal affixed to it. And now methinks I &s;ee the young per&s;ecutor finely equipped, and plea&s;ing him&s;elf with thoughts how triumphantly he &s;hould ride back with the men and women of this way, dragging after him to Jeru&s;alem.</P>
<P>What a condition may we imagine the poor di&s;|ciples at Dama&s;cus were in at this time! No doubt they had heard of Saul's impri&s;oning and making havock of the &s;aints at Jeru&s;alem, and we may well &s;uppo&s;e were appri&s;ed of his de&s;ign again&s;t them. I am per&s;uaded this was a growing, becau&s;e a try|ing time with the&s;e dear people. O how did they wre&s;tle with God in prayer, be&s;eeching him either to deliver them from, or give them grace &s;ufficient to enable them to bear up under the fury of their per&s;ecutors? The high prie&s;t doubtle&s;s with the re&s;t of his reverend brethren, flattered them&s;elves, that they &s;hould now put an effectual &s;top to this growing here&s;y, and waited with impatience for Saul's return.</P>
<P>But, <Q>He that &s;itteth in heaven laughs them to &s;corn, the Lord has them in deri&s;ion.</Q> And therefore, ver. 3. <Q>As Saul journeyed and came even near unto Dama&s;cus,</Q> perhaps to the very gates, (our Lord permitting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to try the faith of his di&s;ciples, and more con&s;picuou&s;ly to baffle the de&s;igns of his enemies) <Q>&s;uddenly (at mid-day; as he acquaints Agrippa) there &s;hined round about him a light from heaven,</Q> a light brighter than the &s;un; <Q>and he fell to the earth, (why not into hell?) and heard a voice &s;aying unto him, Saul, Saul, why per&s;ecute&s;t thou me?</Q> The word is doubled, Saul, Saul: like that of our Lord to Martha; Martha, Martha; or the prophet, O

Our Lord now arre&s;ts the per&s;ecuting zealot, calling him by name; for the word never does us good, till we find it &s;poken to us in particular. <Q>Saul, Saul, why per&s;ecute&s;t thou ME?</Q> Put the empha&s;is upon the word <HI>why,</HI> what evil have I done?

I &s;uppo&s;e Saul thought he was not per&s;ecuting; no, he was only putting the laws of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical court into execution; but Je&s;us, who&s;e eyes are as a flame of fire, &s;aw through the hypocri&s;y of his heart, that, notwith&s;tanding his &s;pecious pretences, all this proceeded from a per&s;ecuting &s;pirit, and &s;ecret enmity of heart again&s;t God; and therefore &s;ays, <Q>Why per&s;ecute&s;t thou ME? Put the empha&s;is upon the word ME, Why per&s;ecute&s;t thou me?</Q> Alas! Saul was not per&s;ecuting Chri&s;t, was he? He was only taking care to prevent innovations in the church, and bringing a company of enthu&s;ia&s;ts to ju&s;tice, who otherwi&s;e would overturn the e&s;tabli&s;hed con&s;titu|tion. But Je&s;us &s;ays, "Why per&s;ecute&s;t thou me?" For what is done to Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples, he takes as done to him&s;elf, whether it be good or whether it be evil. He that touches Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples, touches the apple of his eye; and they that per&s;ecute the followers of our Lord would per&s;ecute our Lord him&s;elf, was he again to come and tabernacle among&s;t us.</P>
<P>I do not find that Saul gives any rea&s;on why he did per&s;ecute; no, he was &s;truck dumb; as every per&s;ecutor will be, when Chri&s;t Je&s;us puts this &s;ame que&s;tion to them at the terrible day of judgment. But being pricked at the heart, no doubt with a

See how &s;oon God can change the heart and voice of his mo&s;t bitter enemies. Not many days ago, Saul was not only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Chri&s;t him&s;elf, but, as much as in him lay, com|pelling others to bla&s;pheme al&s;o.

This admirably points out the way in which God's Spirit works upon the heart: It fir&s;t powerfully convinces of &s;in, and of our damnable &s;tate: and then puts us upon inquiring after Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Saul being &s;truck to the ground or pricked to the heart, cries out after Je&s;us "Who art thou, Lord?" As many of you that were never &s;o far made &s;en&s;ible as your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;tate, as to be made feelingly to &s;eek after Je&s;us Chri&s;t were never yet truly convicted by, much le&s;t converted to, God.

"Je&s;us whom thou per&s;ecute&s;t." This &s;eems to be &s;poken to convince Saul more and more of his &s;in: and I doubt not, but every word was &s;harper than a two-edged &s;word, and came like &s;o many daggars to his heart: O, how did the&s;e words affect him! a Je&s;us! a Saviour! and yet I am per&s;ecuting him! This &s;trikes him with horror; but then the word Je&s;us, though he was a per&s;ecutor, might give him &s;ome hope. However, our dear Lord, to convince Saul that he was to be &s;aved by grace, and that he was not afraid of his power and enmity, tells him, <Q>It is hard for thee to kick again&s;t the pricks.</Q> As much as to &s;hy, though he was per|&s;ecuting, yet he could not overthrow the church of Chri&s;t: For he would &s;it as King upon his holy hill of Zion; tho <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> or devils &s;hould never be able to prevail again&s;t him.</P>

<P>And here we will leave Saul a while, and &s;ee what is become of his companions. But what &s;hall we &s;ay?

They heard a voice, a con|fu&s;ed noi&s;e, out not the articulate voice of him that &s;pake to Saul, and therefore remained uncon|verted. For what are all ordinances, all, even the mo&s;t extraordinary di&s;pen&s;ations of providence, without Chri&s;t &s;peaks to the &s;oul in them? Thus it is now under the word preached: many, like Saul's companions are &s;ometimes &s;o &s;truck with the outgoings of God appearing in the &s;anctuary, that they even &s;tand &s;peechle&s;s; they hear the preacher's voice, but not the voice of the Son of God, who, perhaps at the &s;ame time is &s;peaking effectually to many other hearts; this I have known often; and what &s;hall we &s;ay to the&s;e things?

But to return to Saul: the Lord bids him ari&s;e and go into the city; and we are told, ver&s;e 8. that <Q>Saul <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ro&s;e from the earth; and when his eyes were opened,</Q> (he was &s;o overpowered with the greatne&s;s of the light that &s;hone upon them, that) <Q>he &s;aw no man; but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Dama&s;cus,</Q> that very city which was to be the place of his executing or impri&s;oning the di&s;ciples of the Lord. <Q>And he was three days without fight, and nei|ther did eat nor drink</Q> But who can tell what horrors of con&s;cience, what convul&s;ion of &s;oul, what deep and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> convictions of &s;in he underwent during the&s;e three long days? It was this took away his appetite, (for who can eat or drink when under a &s;en&s;e of the wrath of God for &s;in?) and, being to be greatly employed hereafter, he mu&s;t be greatly humbled now; therefore the Lord leaves him three days groaning under the &s;pirit of bondage, and buffetted, no doubt, with the fiery darts of the devil, that, being tempted like unto his brethren, he might be able hereafter, to &s;uccour tho&s;e that were tempted. Had Saul applied to any of the blind guides of the Jewi&s;h church under the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances, they would have &s;aid, he was mad, or going be&s;ide him&s;elf; as many carnal teachers and blind Phari&s;ees now deal with, and &s;o more and more di&s;tre&s;s poor &s;ouls labouring under awakening convictions of their damnable &s;tate. But God often at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fir&s;t awakenings, vi&s;its us with &s;ore trials, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who are, like Saul, to &s;hine in the church, and to be u&s;ed as in&s;truments in bringing many &s;ons to glory: tho&s;e who are to be highly exalted, mu&s;t fir&s;t be deeply humbled; and this I &s;peak for the comfort of &s;uch, who may be now groaning under the &s;pirit of bondage, and perhaps,

like Saul, can neither eat nor drink; for I have generally ob&s;erved, that tho&s;e who have had the deepe&s;t convictions, have afterwards been favoured with the mo&s;t precious communications, and en|joyed mo&s;t of the divine pre&s;ence in their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. This was afterwards remarkably exemplified <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Saul, who was three days without &s;ight, and nei|ther did eat nor drink.</P>
<P>But will the Lord leave his poor &s;ervant in this di&s;tre&s;s? No: his Je&s;us (though Saul per&s;ecuted him) promi&s;ed and he will perform, that it <Q>&s;hould be told him what he mu&s;t do. And there was a certain di&s;ciple at Dama&s;cus, named Ananias, and unto him &s;aid the Lord, in a vi&s;ion, Ananias; and he &s;aid, Behold, I am here, Lord.</Q> What a holy familiarity is there between Je&s;us Chri&s;t and regenerate &s;ouls! Ananias had been u&s;ed to &s;uch love-vi&s;its, and therefore knew the voice of his beloved. The Lord &s;ays, Ananias; Ananias &s;ays, "Behold, I am here, Lord." Thus it is that Chri&s;t now, as well as formerly, often talks with his children at &s;undry times, and after divers man|ners, as a man talketh with his friend.&mdash;But what has the Lord to &s;ay to Ananias?</P>
<P>Ver. 11. <Q>And the Lord &s;aid unto him, ari&s;e, and go into the &s;treet, which is called Streight, and enquire in the hou&s;e of Judas, for one called Saul of Tar&s;us;</Q> (&s;ee here for your comfort, O children of the mo&s;t high God, what notice Je&s;us Chri&s;t takes of the &s;treet, and the hou&s;e where his own dear &s;ervants lodge) "for behold, he prayeth;" but why is this u&s;hered in with the word <HI>behold?</HI> What, was it &s;uch a wonder to hear that Saul was praying? Why, Saul was a Phari&s;ee, and therefore no doubt, fa&s;ted and made long prayers: and, &s;ince we are told that he profited above many of his
<PB N="127" REF="028079_0124_0FD694657A7295E0">
equals, I doubt not but he was taken notice of for his gift in prayer; and yet it &s;eems, that before the&s;e three days, Saul never prayed in his life; and why; Becau&s;e, before the&s;e three days, he never felt him&s;elf a condemned creature: he was alive in his own opinion, becau&s;e without a knowledge of the &s;piritual meaning of the law; he felt not a want of, and therefore, before now, cried not after a Je&s;us, and con&s;equently, though he might have &s;aid, or made a prayer, as many Phari&s;ees do now-a-days, he never prayed a prayer; but now, be|hold! he prayed indeed; and this was urged as one rea&s;on why he was converted. None of God's children, as one ob&s;erves, comes into the world &s;till-born; prayer is the very breath of the new creature: and therefore, if we are prayerle&s;s, we are CHRIST-le&s;s; if we never had the &s;pirit of &s;upplication, it is a &s;ad &s;ign that we never had the &s;pirit of grace in our &s;ouls: and you may be a&s;&s;ured you never did pray, unle&s;s you have felt your&s;elves &s;inners, and &s;een the want of Je&s;us to be your Sa|viour. May the Lord, whom I &s;erve in the go&s;pel of his dear Son, prick you all to the heart, and may it be &s;aid of you all as it was of Saul, Behold, they pray!</P>
<P>The Lord goes on to encourage Ananias to go to Saul: &s;ays he, ver&s;e 12. <Q>For he hath &s;een in a vi&s;ion a man named Ananias, coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he might receive his &s;ight.</Q> So that though Chri&s;t converted Saul immediately by him&s;elf, yet he will carry on the work, thus begun, by a mini&s;ter. Happy they, who under &s;oul-troubles have &s;uch experienced guides, and as well acquainted with Je&s;us Chri&s;t as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> was: you that have &s;uch make much of and be thank|ful for them; and you who have them not, tru&s;t

<P>Doubtle&s;s, Ananias was a good man; but &s;hall I commend him for his an&s;wer to our Lord? I com|mend him not: for, &s;ays he, ver. 13. <Q>Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy &s;aints at Jeru&s;alem: and here he hath authority from the chief prie&s;ts to bind all that call upon thy name.</Q> I fear this an&s;wer proceeded from &s;ome relics of &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s, as well as infidelity, that h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> undi&s;covered in the heart of Ananias. <Q>Ari&s;e, (&s;aid our Lord) and go into the &s;treet, which is called Streight, and enquire in the hou&s;e of Judas, for one called Saul of Tar|&s;us; for behold he prayeth!</Q> One would think this was &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy him: but &s;ays Ananias, "Lord, I have heard by many of this man" (he &s;eems to &s;peak of him with much contempt; for even good men are apt to think too contemptuou&s;ly of tho&s;e who are yet in their &s;ins) <Q>how much evil he hath done to thy &s;aints at Jeru&s;alem; and here, he hath authority from the chief prie&s;ts, to bind all that call upon thy name.</Q> And what then, Ananias? Is any thing too hard for the Lord? Who made thee to differ? Could not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> who con|verted thee, convert him al&s;o! Surely Ananias here forgets him&s;elf, or perhaps fears, left this man, who had authority from the chief prie&s;ts to bind all that call upon Chri&s;t's name, &s;hould bind him al&s;o, if he went unto him; but the Lord &s;ilences all objec|tions with a <Q>Go thy way, for he is a cho&s;en ve&s;&s;el unto me, to bear my name before the Gen|tiles, and kings, and the children of I&s;rael.

and preaching to him the doctrine of election. And the frequent conver&s;ion of notorious &s;inners to God, to me is one great proof, among&s;t a thou&s;and others, of that precious, but too much exploced, and &s;adly mi&s;repre&s;ented doctrine of God's electing love; for whence is it that &s;uch are taken, whil&s;t thou&s;ands not near &s;o vile, die &s;en&s;ele&s;s and &s;tupid?

Suffer|ing will be found to be the be&s;t preferment, when we are called to give an account of our mini&s;try at the great day.</P>
<P>I do not hear, that Ananias quarrelled with God concerning the doctrine of election: no; O that all good men would, in this, learn of him! <Q>He went his way, and entered into the hou&s;e; and put his hands on him, and &s;aid, Brother Saul;</Q> ju&s;t now it was this man; now it is Brother Saul: It is no matter what a man has been, if he be now a Chri&s;tian; the &s;ame &s;hould be our brother, our &s;i&s;ter, and mother: God blots out every convert's tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions as with a thick cloud, and &s;o &s;hould we; the more vile a man

has been, the more &s;hould we love him when be|lieving in Chri&s;t, becau&s;e Chri&s;t will be more glo|rified on this behalf. I doubt not, but Ananias was wonderfully delighted to hear that &s;o remarkable a per&s;ecutor was brought home to God? I am per|&s;uaded he felt his &s;oul immediately united to him by love, and therefore addre&s;&s;es him not with, <Q>Thou per&s;ecutor, Thou murderer, that came&s;t to butcher me and my friends; but, brother Saul.</Q> It is remarkable that the primitive Chri&s;tians much u&s;ed the word brother and bre|thren; I know it is a term now much in reproach; but tho&s;e who de&s;pi&s;e it, I believe would be glad to be of our brotherhood, when they &s;ee us &s;itting as the right hand of the Maje&s;ty on high. <Q>Brother Saul, the Lord (even Je&s;us that appeared <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> thee in the way as thou came&s;t) hath &s;ent me, that thou mighte&s;t receive thy fight, and be filled with the Holy Gho&s;t.</Q> At this time, we may &s;uppo&s;e, he laid his hands upon him.

<P>The &s;cales then are now removed from the eyes of Saul's mind; Ananias has done that for him, under God; he mu&s;t now do another office&mdash;bap|tize him, and &s;o receive him into the vi&s;ible church of Chri&s;t; a good proof to me of the nece&s;&s;ity of bapti&s;m where it may be had: for I find here, as well as el&s;ewhere, that bapti&s;m is admini&s;tered even to tho&s;e who had received the Holy Gho&s;t; Saul was convinced of this, and therefore aro&s;e and was baptized; and now it is time for him &s;o recruit the outward man, which, by three days ab&s;tinence and &s;piritual conflicts, had been much impaired: we are therefore told (ver&s;e 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">) <Q>when he had received meat, he was &s;trengthened.</Q></P>

Our Lord intimates thus much to us: for in his glo|rious prayer, after he has taught us to pray for our daily bread, immediately adds that petition "forgive us our tre&s;pa&s;&s;es;" as though our daily bread would do us no &s;ervice, unle&s;s we were &s;en|&s;ible of having the forgivene&s;s of our &s;ins.</P>

<P>But who can tell what joy the&s;e di&s;ciples felt when Saul came among&s;t them! I &s;uppo&s;e holy Ananias introduced him.

Chri&s;t Je&s;us for what he had done for their &s;ouls. Saul, perhaps, had &s;at certain years at the feet of Gamaliel, but undoubtedly learnt more the&s;e cer|tain days, than he had learnt before in all his life. It plea&s;es me to think how this great &s;cholar is transformed by the renewing of his mind: what a mighty change was here! That &s;o great a man as Saul was, both as to his &s;tation in life, and internal qualifications, and &s;uch a bitter enemy to the Chri&s;|tians; for him, I &s;ay, to go and be certain days with the people of <HI>this mad way,</HI> and to &s;it quietly, and be taught by illiterate men, as many of the&s;e di&s;ciples we may be &s;ure were, what a &s;ub&s;tantial proof was this of the reality of his conver&s;ion!</P>
<P>What a hurry and confu&s;ion may we &s;uppo&s;e the chief prie&s;ts now were in! I warrant they were rea|dy to cry out, what! is he al&s;o deceived? As for the common people, who knew not the law and are accur&s;ed; for them to be carried away, is no &s;uch wonder, but for a man bred at the feet of Gama|liel, for &s;uch a &s;cholar &s;uch an enemy to the cau&s;e as Saul; for him to be led away with a company of fifty, deceived men and women, &s;urely it is impo&s;|&s;ible: We cannot believe it. But Saul &s;oon con|vinces them of the reality of his becoming a fool for Chri&s;t's &s;ake: For &s;traightway, in&s;tead of go|ing to deliver the letters from the high prie&s;ts, as they expected, in order to bring the di&s;ciples that were at Dama&s;cus bound to Jeru&s;alem, <Q>he preached Chri&s;t in the &s;ynagogues, that he is the Son of God.</Q> This was another proof of his being converted. He not only conver&s;ed with Chri&s;|tians in private, but he preached Chri&s;t publickly in the &s;ynagogues: E&s;pecially, he in&s;i&s;ted on the divi|nity of our Lord, proving, notwith&s;tanding the &s;tate of humiliation, that he was really the Son of God.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="028079_0131_0FD69430925FC410">
But why did Saul preach Chri&s;t thus? Becau&s;e he had felt the power of Chri&s;t upon his own &s;oul. And here is the rea&s;on why Chri&s;t is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> preached, and his divinity &s;o &s;lights in&s;i&s;ted on in our &s;ynagogues, becau&s;e the generality of tho&s;e that pretend to preach him never felt a &s;aving work of conver&s;ion upon their own &s;ouls. How can they preach, unle&s;s they are fir&s;t taught of, and then &s;ent by God? Saul did not preach Chri&s;t before he knew him; no more &s;hould any one el&s;e. An un|converted mini&s;ter, though he could &s;peak with the tongues of men and angels, will be but as a &s;ound|ing bra&s;s and tinkling cymbal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o tho&s;e who&s;e &s;en&s;es are exerci&s;ed to di&s;cern &s;piritual things.

Lord Je&s;us, keep thy own &s;ervants pure, and let them not be then partakers of other men's &s;ins!</P>
<P>Such an in&s;tance as was Saul's conver&s;ion, we may be a&s;&s;ured, mu&s;t make a great deal of noi&s;e; and, therefore, no wonder we are told, ver. 21. <Q>But all that heard him were amazed, and &s;aid, Is not this he that de&s;troyed them who called on this name in Jeru&s;alem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound to the chief prie&s;ts?</Q></P>
<P>Thus it will be with all that appear publickly for Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and it is as impo&s;&s;ible for a true Chri&s;tian to be hid, as a city built upon a hill.

<P>But let not the per&s;ecutors of Chri&s;t take encou|ragement from this to continue in their oppo&s;ition.

Then the que&s;tion, "Why per&s;ecuted thou me?" will cut you through and through. The &s;ecret enmity of your hearts &s;hall be then detected before men and angels, and you &s;hall be doomed to dwell in the blackne&s;s of darkne&s;s for evermore.

<P>OF all the ver&s;es in the book of God, this which I have now read to you, is, I believe, one of the mo&s;t comprehen&s;ive: What glad tidings does it bring to believers!

Does the law condemn? By haring Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s imputed to them, they are dead to the law, as a covenant of works: Chri&s;t has fulfilled it for them, and in their &s;tead. Does death threaten them? They need not fear: The &s;ting of death is &s;in, the &s;trength of &s;in is the law; but God has given them the victory, by imputing to them the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Lord Je&s;us.</P>
<P>And what a privilege in here!

<P N="3">3. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> Chri&s;t is not only made to them righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, but &s;anctification. By &s;anctification, I do not mean a bare hypocritical attendance on out|ward ordinances (though rightly informed Chri&s;|tians will think it their duty and privilege con&s;tant|ly to attend on all outward ordinances.) Nor do I mean by &s;anctification, a bare outward reformation, and a few tran&s;ient convictions, or a little legal &s;orrow; for all this an un&s;anctified man may have; but, by &s;anctification, I mean a total renovation of the whole man; by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, be|lievers become legally, by &s;anctification they are made &s;piritually, alive; by one they are entitled to, by the other they are made meet for glory.

And therefore, being a holy habitation unto the Lord, the whole Trinity dwells and walks in them; even here, they &s;it to|gether with Chri&s;t in heavenly places, and are vitally united to him, their head, by a living faith; their Redeemer, their Maker, is their Hu&s;band; they are fle&s;h of his fle&s;h, bone of his bone; they talk, they walk with him, as a man talketh and walketh with his friend; in &s;hort, they are one with Chri&s;t, even as Je&s;us Chri&s;t and the Father are one.</P>
<P>Thus is Chri&s;t made to believers &s;anctification. And O what a privilege is this! To be changed from bea&s;ts into &s;aints, and from a devili&s;h to be made partakers of a divine nature; to be tran&s;lated from the kingdom of Satan, into the kingdom of God's dear Son!

I almo&s;t &s;tand amazed at the contemplation thereof. Well might the apo&s;tle exhort believers to rejoice in the Lord; indeed they have rea&s;on always to rejoice, yea, to rejoice on a dying bed; for the kingdom of God is in them; they are changed from glory to glory, even by the Spirit of the Lord: well may this be a

<P>But, before we enter upon the explanation and contemplation of this privilege.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Learn hence the great mi&s;take of tho&s;e writers, and clergy, who, notwith&s;tanding they talk of &s;anctification and inward holine&s;s, (as indeed &s;ometimes they do, though in a very loo&s;e and &s;u|perficial manner) yet they generally make it the cau&s;e, whereas they &s;hould con&s;ider it as the effect, of our ju&s;tification. Of him "are ye in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who of God is made unto us wi&s;dom, righ|teou&s;ne&s;s," and then &s;anctification. For Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s, or that which Chri&s;t has done in our &s;tead without us, is the &s;ole cau&s;e of our acceptance in the &s;ight of God, and of all holine&s;s wrought in us. To this, and not to the light within, or any thing wrought within, &s;hould poor &s;inners &s;eek for ju&s;tification in the &s;ight of God: for the &s;ake of Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s alone, and not any thing wrought in us, does God look favourably upon us; our &s;anctification at be&s;t, in this life, is not com|plete: Though we are delivered from the power, we are not freed from the in-being of &s;in; but not only the dominion, but the in-being of &s;in, is for|bidden by the perfect law of God: For it is not &s;aid, <Q>thou &s;halt not give way to lu&s;t, but, thou &s;halt not lu&s;t.</Q> So that whil&s;t the principle of lu&s;t remains in the lea&s;t degree in our hearts, though we are otherwi&s;e never &s;o holy, yet we cannot, on account of that, hope for acceptance with God: We mu&s;t fir&s;t therefore, look for a righteou&s;ne&s;s without us, even the righteou&s;ne&s;s of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t: For this rea&s;on the apo&s;tle mentions it, and puts it before &s;anctification in the words of the

<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> From hence al&s;o, the Antinomians and formal hypocrites may be confuted who talk of Chri&s;t without, but know nothing, experimentally, of a work of &s;anctification wrought within them. Whatever they may pretend to, &s;ince Chri&s;t is not in them, the Lord is not their righteou&s;ne&s;s, and they have no well-grounded hope of glory: For though &s;anctification is not the cau&s;e, yet it is the effect of our acceptance with God; <Q>who of God is made unto us righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;anctification.</Q> He therefore, that is really in Chri&s;t, is a new creature; it is not going back to a covenant of works, to look into our hearts, and, &s;eeing that they are changed and renewed, from thence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a comfortable and well-grounded a&s;&s;urance of the &s;afety of our &s;tates: No, but this is what we are directed to in &s;cripture; by our bringing forth the fruits, we are to judge whether or no we ever did truly partake of the Spirit of God. <Q>We know, (&s;ays John) that we are pa&s;&s;ed from death unto life, becau&s;e we love the brethren.</Q> And how|ever we may talk of Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s, and ex|claim again&s;t legal preachers; yet, if we are not holy in heart and life, if we are not &s;anctified and renewed by the Spirit in our minds, we are &s;elf-de|ceivers, we are only formal hypocrites: For we mu&s;t not put a&s;under what God has joined together; we mu&s;t keep the medium between the two extremes: not in&s;i&s;t &s;o much on the one hand upon Chri&s;t with|out, as to exclude Chri&s;t within, as an evidence of our being his, and as a preparation for future happi|ne&s;s; nor on the other hand, &s;o depend on inherent righteou&s;ne&s;s or holine&s;s wrought in us, as to exclude the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t without us.

Tho&s;e whom God has ju&s;tified, he has in effect glorified: for as a man's worthine&s;s was not the cau&s;e of God's giving him Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;o neither &s;hall his un|worthine&s;s be a cau&s;e of his taking it away; God's gifts and callings are without repentance, and I cannot think they are clear in the notion of Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s, who deny the final per&s;everance of the &s;aints; I fear, they under&s;tand ju&s;tification in that low &s;en&s;e, which I under&s;tood it in a few years ago, as implying no more than remi&s;&s;ion of &s;in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> but it not only &s;ignifies remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins pa&s;t, but al&s;o a foederal right to all good things to come.

he &s;ays, "who of God is made unto us righ|teou&s;ne&s;s," does not &s;ay, perhaps he may be made to us &s;anctification and redemption; but he is made: for there is an eternal, indi&s;&s;oluble con|nection between the&s;e ble&s;&s;ed privileges. As the obedience of Chri&s;t is imputed to believers, &s;o his per&s;everance in that obedience is to be imputed to them al&s;o: and it argues great ignorance of the covenant of grace and redemption to object again&s;t it.</P>
<P>By the word redemption, we are to under&s;tand, not only a complete deliverance from all evil, but al&s;o a full enjoyment of all good both in body and &s;oul: I &s;ay both in body and &s;oul; for the Lord is al&s;o for the body; the bodies of the &s;aints in this life are temples of the Holy Gho&s;t; God makes a covenant with the du&s;t of believers; after death, though worms de&s;troy them, yet, even in their fle&s;h &s;hall they &s;ee God.

But all this is only the rea&s;oning of unlearned, un&s;table men, who certainly know not what they &s;ay, nor where|of they affirm. That we mu&s;t follow our Lord in the regeneration, be partakers of a new birth, and that Chri&s;t mu&s;t come into our hearts, we freely confe&s;s, and we hope, when &s;peaking of the&s;e things, we &s;peak no more than what we know and

Can you with all the &s;trength of natural rea&s;on, find out a better way of acceptance with God, than by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t?

Why will you not &s;ubmit to his righteou&s;ne&s;s? Can you deny that you are fallen creatures? Do not you find that you are full of di&s;orders and that the&s;e di&s;orders make you unhappy? Do not you find that you cannot change your own hearts? Have you not re&s;olved many and many a time, and have not your corruptions yet dominion over you? Are you not bond-&s;laves to your lu&s;ts, and led captive by the devil at his will? Why then will you not come to Chri&s;t for &s;anctification?

You are unholy; flee to the Lord Je&s;us: he is full of grace and truth? and of his fulne&s;s, all may re|ceive that believe in him.

Whatever you may think, it is the mo&s;t unrea&s;on|able thing in the world not to believe on Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whom God hath &s;ent. Why, why will you die? Why will you not come unto him, that you may have life? Ho? every one that thir&s;teth, come unto the waters of life and drink freely: Come, buy without money and without price.

But they are to be freely given of God to the wor&s;t of &s;inners.

Though, E&s;au-like, you have been profane, and hitherto depi&s;ed your heavenly Fa|ther's birth-right; even now, if you believe, Chri&s;t will be made to you of God, <Q>wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anctification, and redemption.</Q></P>
<P>But I mu&s;t turn again to believers, for who&s;e in|&s;truction, as I ob&s;erved before, this di&s;cour&s;e was particularly intended. You &s;ee, brethren, par|takers of the heavenly calling, what great ble&s;&s;ings are trea&s;ured up for you in Je&s;us Chri&s;t your head, and what you are entitled to by believing on his name. Take heed, therefore, that ye walk wor|thy of the vocation wherewith ye are called. Think often how highly you are favoured; and re|member, you have not cho&s;en Chri&s;t, but Chri&s;t hath cho&s;en you. Put on (as the elect of God) humblene&s;s of mind, and glory, but let it be only in the Lord: for you have nothing but what you have received of God. By nature, ye were as fooli&s;h, as legal, as unholy, and in as damnable a condition as others. Be pitiful, therefore, be courteous; and, as &s;anctification in a progre&s;&s;ive work, beware of thinking you have already attain|ed. Let him that is holy, be holy &s;till; knowing that he who is mo&s;t pure in heart, &s;hall hereafter enjoy the cleare&s;t vi&s;ion of God.

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>LUKE xviii. 14.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>I tell you this man went down to his hou&s;e ju&s;tified rather than the other: For every one that exalteth him&s;elf, &s;hall be aba&s;ed: and he that humbleth him|&s;elf, &s;hall be exalted.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THOUGH there be &s;ome who dare to deny the Lord Je&s;us, and di&s;believe the revelation he has been plea&s;ed to give us, and thereby bring upon them&s;elves &s;wift de&s;truction; yet I would charitably hope there are but few, if any &s;uch a|mong you to whom I am now to preach the king|dom of God. Was I to a&s;k you, <Q>how you expect to be ju&s;tified in the &s;ight of an offended God?</Q> I &s;uppo&s;e you would an&s;wer, only for the &s;ake of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. But, was I to come more home to your con&s;ciences, I fear mo&s;t would make the Lord Je&s;us but in part their Saviour, and go about, as it were, to e&s;tabli&s;h a righteou&s;ne&s;s of their own. And this is not thinking contrary to the rules of Chri&s;tian charity: For we are all &s;elf-righteous by nature; it is as natural for us to turn back to a covenant of works, as for the &s;parks to fly upwards. We have had &s;o many legal and &s;o few free-grace preachers, for the&s;e many years, that mo&s;t profe&s;|&s;ors now &s;eem to be &s;ettled upon their lees, and
<PB N="161" REF="028079_0158_0FD694D0548D0838">
rather de&s;erve the title of Phari&s;ees than Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>Thus it was with the generality of the people during the time of our Lord's public mini&s;trations: And therefore, in almo&s;t all his di&s;cour&s;es, he preached the go&s;pel to poor &s;inners, and denounced terrible woes again&s;t proud &s;elf-ju&s;ticiaries. The parable to which the words of the text belong, looks both the&s;e ways: For the evangeli&s;t informs as, (ver. 9) that our Lord <Q>&s;pake it unto certain who tru&s;ted in them&s;elves, than they were righte|ous, and depi&s;ed others</Q> And a notable para|ble it is; a parable worthy your mo&s;t &s;erious at|tention. "He that hath ears to hear let him hear" what Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;peaks to all vi&s;ible profe&s;&s;ors in it.</P>
<P>Ver. 16. "Two men went up to the temple to pray," (and never two men of more oppo&s;ite cha|racters) <Q>the one a Phari&s;ee, and the other a Pub|lican.</Q> The Phari&s;ees were the &s;tricte&s;t &s;ect a|mong the Jews. I was of the &s;tricte&s;t &s;ect of the Phari&s;ees &s;ays Paul. They prayed often; not only &s;o, but they made long prayers; and, that they might appear extraordinary devout, they would pray at the corners of the &s;treet, where two ways met, that people going or coming, both ways, might &s;ee them. <Q>They made broad (as our Lord informs us) the borders of their philacte|ries,</Q> they had pieces of parchment &s;own to their long robes, on which &s;ome parts of the &s;cripture were written, that people might from thence infer, that they were lovers of the law of God. They were &s;o very punctual and exact in outward puri|fications, that they wa&s;hed at their going out and coming in. They held the wa&s;hing of pots, brazen ve&s;&s;els and tables, and many other &s;uch like things they did. They were very zealous for the tradi|tions
<PB N="162" REF="028079_0159_0FD69492CD12A248">
of the fathers, and for the ob&s;ervation of the rites and ceremonies of the church, notwith&s;tanding they frequently made void the law of God by their traditions. And they were &s;o exceedingly exact in the outward ob&s;ervation of the Sabbath, that they condemned our Lord for making a little clay with his &s;pittle; and called him a &s;inner, and &s;aid, he was not of God, becau&s;e he had given &s;ight to a man born blind, on the Sabbath-day. For the&s;e rea&s;ons they were had in high veneration among the people, who were &s;adly mi&s;led by the&s;e blind guides. They had the uppermo&s;t places in the &s;ynagogues, and greetings in the market places (which they loved dearly) and were called of men, Rabbi; in &s;hort, they had &s;uch a reputation for piety, that it became a proverb among the Jews, that if there were but two men &s;aved, the one of them mu&s;t be a Phari&s;ee.</P>
<P>As for the Publicans it was not &s;o with them. It &s;eems they were &s;ometimes Jews, or at lea&s;t pro|&s;elytes of the gate; for we find the one here coming up to the temple; but for the generality, I am apt to think they were Gentiles; for they were gather|ers of the Roman taxes, and u&s;ed to ama&s;s much wealth (as appears by the confe&s;&s;ion of Zaccheus one of the chief of them) by wronging men by fal&s;e accu&s;ations. They were &s;o univer&s;ally infamous, that our Lord him&s;elf tells his di&s;ciples, the excom|municated man &s;hould be to them as a Heathen man, or a Publican. And the Phari&s;ees thought it a &s;ufficient impeachment of our Lord's character, that he was a <Q>friend to Publicans and &s;inners, and went to &s;it down with them at meat.</Q></P>
<P>But, however they di&s;agreed in other things, they agreed in this, that public wor&s;hip is a duty incum|bent upon all: For they both came up to the tem|ple.
<PB N="163" REF="028079_0160_0FD694D225362F20">
The very Heathens were ob&s;ervers of temple-wor&s;hip. We have very early notice of men's &s;a|crificing to, and calling upon the name of the Lord, in the Old Te&s;tament! and I find it no where con|tradicted in the New. Our Lord, and his apo&s;tles, went up to the temple, and we are commanded by the apo&s;tle, <Q>not to for&s;ake the a&s;&s;embling of our|&s;elves together,</Q> as the manner of too many is in our days; and &s;uch too, as would have us think well of them, though they &s;eldom or never tread the courts of the Lord's hou&s;e. But, though our devotions begin in our clo&s;ets, they mu&s;t not end there. And, if people never &s;hew their devotions abroad, I mu&s;t &s;u&s;pect they have little or none at home. "Two men went up to the temple." And what went they thither for? Not (as multitudes among&s;t us do) to make the hou&s;e of God a hou&s;e of merchandi&s;e, or to turn it into a den of thieves; much le&s;s to ridicule the preacher, or di&s;turb the congregation. No, they came to the temple, &s;ays our Lord, to pray. Thither &s;hould the tribes of God's &s;piritual I&s;rael go up, to walk with and pour out their hearts before the mighty God of Jacob.</P>
<P>"Two men went up to the temple to pray." I fear one of them forgot his errand. I have often been at a lo&s;s what to call the Phari&s;ee's addre&s;s. It certainly does not de&s;erve the name of a prayer: He may rather be &s;aid to come to the temple to boa&s;t, than to pray; for I do not find one word of confe&s;&s;ion of his original guilt; not one &s;ingle pe|tition for pardon of his pa&s;t actual &s;ins, or for grace to help and a&s;&s;i&s;t him for the time to come: he only brings in God, as it were, a reckoning of his per|formances, and does that, which no fle&s;h can ju&s;tly do, I mean, glory in his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 11. <Q>The Phari&s;ee &s;tood, and prayed thus
<PB N="164" REF="028079_0161_0FD69497751D61B0">
with him&s;elf; God, I thank thee that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unju&s;t, adulterers or even as this Publican.</Q></P>
<P>Our Lord fir&s;t takes notice of his po&s;ture; the Phari&s;ee &s;tood, he is not to be condemned for that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> for &s;tanding, as well as kneeling, is a proper <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> for prayer. When you &s;tand praying, &s;ays our Lord; though &s;ometimes our Lord kneeled, nay, lay flat on his face upon the ground; his apo&s;tles al&s;o kneeled, as we read in the Acts, which has made me wonder at &s;ome, who are &s;o bigotted to &s;tanding in family as well as public prayer that they will not kneel, notwith&s;tanding all kneel that are around them. I fear there is &s;omething of the Phari&s;ee is this conduct. Kneeling and &s;tanding are indiffe|rent, if the knee of the &s;oul be bent, and the hear upright towards God. We &s;hould &s;tudy not to be particular in indifferent things, le&s;t we offend weak minds. What the Phari&s;ee is remarked for, is his &s;tanding by him&s;elf: For the words may be rendered, he &s;tood by him&s;elf, upon &s;ome eminent place, at the upper part of the temple, near the holy of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, that the congregation might &s;ee what a devout man he was: Or it may be under&s;tood as we read it, he prayed by him&s;elf or of him&s;elf out of his own heart; he did not pray by form, it was an extem|pore prayer: For there are many Phari&s;ees that pray and preach too extempore. I do not &s;een why the&s;e may not be acquired, as well as other arts and &s;ciences. A man, with a good elocution, ready turn of thought, and good memory, may repeat his own or other men's &s;ermons, and by the help of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Wilkins or Henry, may pray &s;eemingly excellently well and yet not have the lea&s;t grain of true grace in his heart; and I &s;peak this, not to cry down ex|tempore prayer, or to di&s;courage tho&s;e dear &s;ouls
<PB REF="028079_0162_0FDBB2F18888B910">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="165" REF="028079_0163_0FD694D553094A80">
who really pray by the Spirit: I only would hereby give a word of reproof to tho&s;e who are to bigotted to extempore prayer, that they condemn, at lea&s;t judge, all that u&s;e forms, as though not &s;o holy and heavenly, as others who pray without them. Alas! this is wrong. Not every one that prays extempore is a &s;piritual, nor every one that prays with a form, a formal man. Let us not judge one another; let not him that u&s;es a form, judge him that prays ex|tempore, on that account; and let not him that prays extempore, de&s;pi&s;e him who u&s;es a form. "The Phari&s;ee &s;tood, and prayed thus by him&s;elf." Which may &s;ignify al&s;o praying inwardly in his heart; for there is a way (and that an excellent one too) of praying when we cannot &s;peak; thus Anna prayed when &s;he &s;poke not aloud, only her lips moved. Thus God &s;ays to Mo&s;es, <Q>Why crie&s;t thou?</Q> when it is plain, he did not &s;peak a word. This is what the apo&s;tle means by the <Q>Spirit making interce&s;&s;ion (for believers) with groanings which cannot be uttered.</Q> For there are times when the &s;oul is too big to &s;peak; when God fills as it were, and over&s;hadows it with his pre&s;ence, &s;o that it can only fall down, wor&s;hip, adore, and lie in the du&s;t before the Lord. Again, there is a time when the &s;oul is benumbed, barren, and dry, and the believer has not a word to &s;ay to his heavenly Father; and then the heart only can &s;peak. And I mention this for the encouragement of weak Chri&s;tians, who think they never are ac|cepted but when they have a flow of words, and fancy they do not plea&s;e God at the bottom, for no other rea&s;on but becau&s;e they do not plea&s;e them|&s;elves. Such would do well to con&s;ider, that God knows the language of the heart, and the mind of the &s;pirit; and that we make u&s;e of words, not to

inform God, but to affect our&s;elves. When ever therefore any of you find your&s;elves in &s;uch a frame be not di&s;couraged: offer your&s;elves up in &s;ilence before God, as clay in the hands of the potter, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> him to write and &s;tamp his own divine image upon your &s;ouls.

But he not only boa&s;ts, but lies be|fore God (as all &s;elf-ju&s;ticiaries will be found liars here or hereafter.) He thanks God that he was not unju&s;t: but is it not an act of the highe&s;t inju&s;|tice to rob God of his prerogative! Is it not an act of inju&s;tice to judge our neighbour? And yet of both the&s;e crimes this &s;elf-righteous vaunter is guilty. "Even as this Publican!"

Thou proud, confident boa&s;ter, what had&s;t thou to do with that poor Pub|lican? Suppo&s;ing other Publicans were unju&s;t, and extortioners, did it therefore follow that he mu&s;t be &s;o? Or if he had been &s;uch a &s;inner, how know|e&s;t thou but he has repented of tho&s;e &s;ins? His coming up to the temple to pray, is one good &s;ign of a reformation at lea&s;t. Thou art therefore in|excu&s;able, O Phari&s;ee, who thus judge&s;t the Pub|lican: for thou that judge&s;t him to be unju&s;t, art, in the very act of judging, unju&s;t thy&s;elf: thy &s;a|crifice is only the &s;acrifice of a fool.</P>
<P>We have &s;een what the Phari&s;ee's negative good|ne&s;s comes to; I think, nothing at all. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> us now &s;ee how far his po&s;itive goodne&s;s extends; for, if we are truly religious, we &s;hall not e&s;chew evil, but al&s;o do good: "I fa&s;t twice in the week, I give tithes of "all that I po&s;&s;e&s;s."</P>
<P>The Phari&s;ee is not here condemned for his fa&s;t|ing, for fa&s;ting is a Chri&s;tian duty; "when you fa&s;t," &s;ays our Lord, thereby taking it for granted, that his di&s;ciples would fa&s;t. And <Q>when the bride|groom

And all that would not be ca&s;t-aways, will take care, as their privilege, without legal con&s;traint, to "keep their bodies under, and bring them into &s;ubjection." The Phari&s;ee is only condemned for making a righteou&s;ue&s;s of his fa&s;ting, and thinking that God would accept him, or that he was any better then his neighbours, merely on account of his fa&s;ting: this is what he was blamed for. The Phari&s;ee was not to be di&s;commended for fa&s;ting twice in a week; I wi&s;h &s;ome Chri&s;tians would imitate him more in this: but to depend on fa&s;ting in the lea&s;t, for his ju&s;tification in the fight of God was really abominable. "I give tithes of all that I po&s;&s;e&s;s:" He might as well have &s;aid, I pay tithes. But &s;elf righteous people (whatever they may &s;ay to the contrary) think they give-&s;omething to God. I give tithes, of all that I po&s;&s;e&s;s: I make con&s;cience of giving tithes, not only of all that the law requires, but of my mint, anni&s;e, and cummin, of all things what&s;oever I po&s;&s;e&s;s; this was well; but to boa&s;t of &s;uch things, or of fa&s;ting, is Phari&s;aical and devili&s;h. Now then let us &s;um up all the righteou&s;ne&s;s of this boa&s;ting Phari&s;ee, and &s;ee what little rea&s;on he had to tru&s;t in him&s;elf, that he was righteous, or to de&s;pi&s;e others. He is not unju&s;t (but we have only his word for that, I think I have proved the contra|ry;) he is no adulterer, no extortioner; he fa&s;ts twice in the week, and gives tithes of all that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es; and all this he might do, and a great deal more, and yet be a child of the devil: for here is no mention made of his loving the Lord his God with all his heart, which was the "fir&s;t and great commandment of the law;" here is not a &s;ingle &s;yllable of inward religion; and he was not a true

<P>Were not the Phari&s;ees, do you think, highly offended at this character? For they might ea&s;ily know that it was &s;poken again&s;t them. And though perhaps &s;ome of you may be offended at me, yet, out of love, I mu&s;t tell you, I fear this parable is &s;poken again&s;t many of you: For are there not many of you, who go up to the temple to pray, with no better &s;pirit than this Phari&s;ee did? And becau&s;e you fa&s;t it may be in the Lent, or every Friday; and becau&s;e you do nobody any harm, receive the &s;acrament, pay tithes, and give an alms now and then; you think that you are &s;afe, and tru&s;t in your&s;elves that you are righteous, and inwardly de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e, who do not come up to you in the&s;e outward duties? This, I am per&s;uaded, is the ca&s;e of many of you, though, alas! it is a de&s;perate one, as I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew at the clo&s;e of this di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Let us now take a view of the Publican, ver&s;e 13. <Q>And the Publican &s;tanding afar off, would not lift up &s;o much as his eyes unto heaven. but &s;mote upon his brea&s;t, &s;aying, God be merciful to me a &s;inner.</Q></P>
<P>The "Publican &s;tanding afar off."

He neither called nor u&s;ed them as &s;ervants, but as friends: and he revealed his &s;ecrets to them from time to time.

<P>I &s;ay, generally: for as God is a &s;overeign agent, his &s;acred &s;pirit bloweth not only on whom, but when and how it li&s;teth. Therefore, far be it from me to confine the Almighty to one way of acting; or &s;ay, that all undergo an equal degree of convic|tion; no, there is a holy variety in God's methods of calling home his elect. But this we may affirm a&s;&s;uredly, that, wherever there is a work of true conviction and conver&s;ion wrought upon a &s;inner's heart, the Holy Gho&s;t, whether by a greater or le&s;s degree of inward &s;oul-trouble, does that which our Lord Je&s;us told the di&s;ciples, in the words of the text, that he &s;hould do when he came.</P>
<P>If any of you ridicule inward religion, or think there is no &s;uch thing as our feeling or receiving the Holy Gho&s;t, I fear my preaching will be quite fooli&s;hne&s;s to you, and that you will under&s;tand me no more than if I &s;poke to you in an unknown tongue. But as the promi&s;e in the text is made to the world, and as I know it will be fulfilling till
<PB N="180" REF="028079_0178_0FD694A69A9A68D8">
time &s;hall be no more, I &s;hall proceed to explain the general way whereby the Holy Gho&s;t works upon every converted &s;inner's heart; and I hope that the Lord, even whil&s;t I am &s;peaking, will be plea&s;ed to fulfil it in many of your hearts. <Q>And when he is come, he will reprove the world of fin of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and of judgment.</Q></P>
<P>The word which we tran&s;late reprove, ought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> be rendered convince; and in the original at im|plies a conviction by way of argumentation, and coming with a power upon the mind equal to a de|mon&s;tration. A great many &s;coffers of the&s;e lo&s;t days, will a&s;k &s;uch as they term pretenders to the Spirit, how they feel the Spirit, and how they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the Spirit? They might as well a&s;k, how they know, and how they feel the &s;un when it &s;hines upon the body? For with equal power and demon&s;tration does the Spirit of God work upon and convince the &s;oul. And.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> It convinces of &s;in; and generally of &s;ome enormous &s;in, the wor&s;t perhaps the convicted per|&s;on ever was guilty of. Thus, when our Lord was conver&s;ing with the woman of Samaria, he con|vinced her fir&s;t of her adultery: <Q>Woman, go call thy hu&s;band. The woman an&s;wered, and &s;aid, I have no hu&s;band. Je&s;us &s;aid unto her, Thou ha&s;t well &s;aid, I have no hu&s;band: for thou ha&s;t had five hu&s;bands, and he whom thou now ha&s;t, is not thy hu&s;band; in this &s;aid&s;t thou truly.</Q> With this, there went &s;uch powerful conviction of all her other actual &s;ins, that &s;oon after, &s;he <Q>left her water-pot, and went her way into the city, and &s;aith to the men, Come, and &s;ee a man that told me all things that ever I did: Is not this the Chri&s;t?</Q> Thus our Lord al&s;o dealt with the per&s;ecutor Saul: he convinced him fir&s;t of the
<PB N="181" REF="028079_0179_0FD694EBAA1262C0">
horrid &s;in of per&s;ecution; <Q>Saul, Saul, why per|&s;ecute&s;t thou me?</Q> Such a &s;en&s;e of all his other &s;ins, probably at the &s;ame time revived in his mind, that immediately he died; that is, died to all his fal&s;e confidences, and was thrown into &s;uch an agony of &s;oul, that he continued three days, and neither did eat nor drink. This is the method the Spirit of God generally takes in dealing with &s;inners; he fir&s;t convinces them of &s;ome heinous actual fin, and at the &s;ame time brings all their other &s;ins in|to remembrance; and as it were &s;ets them in bat|tle-array before them: <Q>When he is come, he will reprove the world of fin.</Q></P>
<P>And was it ever thus with you, my dear hearers? (For I mu&s;t que&s;tion you as I go along, becau&s;e I intend, by the divine help, to preach not only to your heads, but your hearts.) Did the Spirit of God ever bring all your &s;ins thus to remembrance, and make you cry out to God, <Q>thou write&s;t bit|ter things again&s;t me?</Q> Did your actual &s;ins ever appear before you, as though drawn in a map? If not, you have great rea&s;on (unle&s;s you were &s;anctified from the womb) to &s;u&s;pect that you are not convicted, much more not converted, and that the promi&s;e of the text was never yet fulfilled in your hearts.</P>
<P>Farther: When the Comforter comes into a &s;in|ner's heart, though it generally convinces the &s;in|ner of his actual &s;in fir&s;t, yet it leads him to &s;ee and bewail his original &s;in, the fountain from which all the&s;e polluted &s;treams do flow.</P>
<P>Though every thing in the earth, air and water; every thing both without and within, concur to prove the truth of that a&s;&s;ertion in the &s;cripture, "in Adam we have all died;" yet mo&s;t are &s;o hardened through the deceitfulne&s;s of &s;in, that not|with&s;tanding
<PB N="182" REF="028079_0180_0FD694AB0D198BD0">
they may give an a&s;&s;ent to the truth of the propo&s;ition in their heads, yet they never felt it really in their hearts. Nay, &s;ome in words profe&s;&s;edly deny it, though their works too, too plainly prove them to be degenerate &s;ons of a de|generate father. But when the Comforter, the Spirit of God, arre&s;ts a &s;inner, and convinces him of &s;in, all carnal rea&s;oning again&s;t original cor|ruption, every proud and high imagination, which exalteth it&s;elf again&s;t that doctrine, is immediately thrown down; and he is made to cry out, <Q>Who &s;hall deliver me from the body of this death;</Q> he now finds that concupi&s;cence is &s;in; and does not &s;o much bewail his actual &s;ins, as the inward perver&s;ene&s;s of his heart, which he now finds not only to be an enemy to, but al&s;o direct enmity again&s;t God.</P>
<P>And did the Comforter, my dear friends, ever come with &s;uch a convincing power as this into your hearts? Were you ever made to &s;ee and feel, that in your fle&s;h dwelleth no good thing; that you are conceived and born in &s;in; that you are by nature children of wrath; that God would be ju&s;t if he damned you, though you never committed an actual &s;in in your lives? So often as you have been at church and &s;acrament, did you ever feelingly con|fe&s;s, that there was no health in you; that the re|membrance of your original and actual &s;ins was grievous unto you, and the burden of them intole|rable? If not, you have been only offering to God vain oblations; you never yet prayed in your lives, the Comforter never yet came effectually into your &s;ouls: con&s;equently you are not in the faith pro|perly &s;o called; no, you are at pre&s;ent in a &s;tate of death and damnation.</P>
<P>Again, the Comforter, when he comes effectually
<PB N="183" REF="028079_0181_0FD694ECDFC9BDB8">
to work upon a &s;inner, not only convinces him of the &s;in of his nature, and the &s;in of his life, but al&s;o of the &s;in of his duties.</P>
<P>We all naturally are legalli&s;ts, thinking to be ju&s;tified by the works of the law. When &s;omewhat awakened by the terrors of the Lord, we immedi|ately, like the Phari&s;ees of old, go about to e&s;tabli&s;h our own righteou&s;ne&s;s, and think we &s;hall find ac|ceptance with God, if we &s;eek it with tears: find|ing our&s;elves damned by nature and our actual &s;ins, we then think to recommend our&s;elves to God by our duties, and hope, by our doings of one kind or another, to inherit eternal life. But, whenever the Comforter comes into the heart, it convinces the &s;oul of the&s;e fal&s;e re&s;ts, and makes the &s;inner to &s;ee that all his righteou&s;ne&s;&s;es are but as filthy rags; that his be&s;t works are but &s;o many &s;plendid &s;ins; and that, for the mo&s;t pompous &s;ervices he de&s;erves no better a doom than that of the unprofitable &s;er|vant, to be thrown into outer darkne&s;s, where is weeping, and wailing, and gna&s;hing of teeth.</P>
<P>And was this degree of conviction ever wrought in any of your &s;ouls? Did the Comforter ever come into your hearts, &s;o as to make you &s;ick of your duties, as well as your &s;ins? Were you ever, with the great apo&s;tle of the Gentiles, made to abhor your own righteou&s;ne&s;s which is by the law, and acknowledge that you de&s;erve to be damned, though you &s;hould give all your goods to feed the poor? Were you made to feel, that your very repentance needed to be repented of, and that every thing in your&s;elves is but dung and dro&s;s? And that all the arguments you can fetch for mercy, mu&s;t be out of the heart and pure unmerited love of God? Were you ever made to lie at the feet of &s;overeign grace, and to &s;ay, Lord, if thou wilt, thou maye&s;t &s;ave
<PB N="184" REF="028079_0182_0FD694AC75508388">
me; if not, thou maye&s;t ju&s;tly damn me; I have nothing to plead; I can in no wi&s;e ju&s;tify my&s;elf in thy &s;ight; my be&s;t performances, I &s;ee will con|demn me; and all I have to depend upon is thy free grace? What &s;ay you? Was this, ever, or is this now; the habitual language of your hearts? You have been frequently at the temple; but did you ever approach it in the temper of the poor Publican; and, after you have done all, acknowledge that you have done nothing; and upon a feeling experi|mental &s;en&s;e of your own unworthine&s;s and &s;infulne&s;s every way, &s;mite upon your brea&s;ts, and &s;ay, <Q>God be merciful to us &s;inners?</Q> If you never were thus minded, the Comforter never yet effectually came into your &s;ouls, you are out of Chri&s;t; and if God &s;hould require your &s;ouls in that condition, he would be no better to you than a con&s;uming fire.</P>
<P>But there is a fourth &s;in, of which the comforter, when he comes, convinces the &s;oul, and which alone (it is very remarkable) our Lord mentions as though it was the only &s;in worth mentioning; for indeed it is the root of all other &s;ins what&s;oever: It is the reigning as well as the damning &s;in of the world. And what now do you imagine that &s;in may be; It is that cur&s;ed &s;in, that root of all other evils, I mean the &s;in of unbelief. <Q>Of &s;in, becau&s;e they believe not on me.</Q></P>
<P>But does the Chri&s;tian world or any of you that hear me this day, want the Holy Gho&s;t to convince you of unbelief? Are there any infidels here? Yes, (O that I had not too great rea&s;on to think &s;o) I fear mo&s;t are &s;uch: Not indeed &s;uch infidels as pro|fe&s;&s;edly deny the Lord that bought us (though I fear too many even of &s;uch mon&s;ters are in every coun|try;) but I mean &s;uch unbelievers, that have no more faith in Chri&s;t than the devils them&s;elves.
<PB N="185" REF="028079_0183_0FD694EE68477278">
Perhaps you may think, you believe, becau&s;e you repeat the creed, or &s;ub&s;cribe to a confe&s;&s;ion of &s;aith, becau&s;e you go to church or meeting, receive the &s;acrament, and are taken into full communion. The&s;e are ble&s;&s;ed privileges; but all this may be done, without our being true believers. And I know not how to detect your fal&s;e hypocritical faith better, than by putting to you this que&s;tion. How long have you believed? Would not mo&s;t of you &s;ay, as long as we can remember, we never did di&s;believe. Then this is a certain &s;ign that you have no true faith at all; No, not &s;o much as a grain of mu&s;tard &s;eed: For if you believe now, (unle&s;s you were &s;anctified from your infancy, which is the ea&s;e of &s;ome) you mu&s;t know that there was a time in which you did not believe on the Lord Je&s;us, Chri&s;t; and the Holy Gho&s;t, if ever you received it, convinced you of this. Eternal Truth has de|clared, <Q>when he is come he will convince the world of &s;in, becau&s;e they believe not on me.</Q></P>
<P>None of us believe by nature: But after the Holy Gho&s;t has convinced us of the &s;in of our natures, and the &s;in of our lives and duties, in order to con|vince us of our utter inability to &s;ave our&s;elves, and that we mu&s;t be beholden to God, as for every thing el&s;e, &s;o for faith (without which it is impo&s;|&s;ible to plea&s;e, or be &s;aved by Chri&s;t) he convinces us al&s;o that we have no faith. Do&s;t thou believe on the Son of God? is the grand que&s;tion which the Holy Gho&s;t now puts to the &s;oul: At the &s;ame time he works with &s;uch power and demon&s;trations, that the &s;oul &s;ees, and is obliged to confe&s;s, that it has no faith.</P>
<P>This is a thing little thought of by mo&s;t who call them&s;elves believers. They dream they are Chri&s;|tians becau&s;e they live in a Chri&s;tian country: If
<PB N="186" REF="028079_0184_0FD694AEE997C420">
they were born Turks, they would believe on Ma|homet; for what is that which men commonly call faith, but an outward con&s;ent to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> religion? But do not you thus deceive your our|&s;elves; true faith is quite another thing. A&s;k your|&s;elves, therefore, whether or not the Holy Gho&s;t ever powerfully convinced you of the &s;in of unbe|lief? You are perhaps &s;o devout (you may imagine) as to get a catalogue of &s;ins, which you look over, and confe&s;s in a formal manner, as often as you go to the holy &s;acrament: But among all your &s;ins, did you ever once confe&s;s and bewail that damning &s;in of unbelief? Were you ever made to cry out, Lord, give me faith; Lord, give me to believe on thee; O that I had faith! O that I could believe! If you never were thus di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, at lea&s;t, if you never &s;aw and felt, that you had no faith, it is a certain &s;ign that the Holy Gho&s;t the Comforter, ne|ver came into and worked &s;avingly upon your &s;ouls.</P>
<P>But is it not odd, that the Holy Gho&s;t &s;hould be called a Comforter, when it is plain, by the expe|rience of all God's children, that this work of con|viction is u&s;ually attended with &s;ore inward con|flicts, and a great deal of &s;oul-trouble? I an&s;wer, the Holy Gho&s;t may well be termed a Comforter, even in this work; becau&s;e it is the only way to, and ends in true &s;olid comfort. Ble&s;&s;ed are they that are thus convicted by him; for they &s;hall be comforted. Nay, not only &s;o, but there is pre&s;ent comfort, even in the mid&s;t of the&s;e convictions; The &s;oul &s;ecretly rejoices in the &s;ight of its own mi&s;ery, ble&s;&s;es God for bringing it out of darkne&s;s into light, and looks forward with a comfortable pro&s;pect of future deliverances, knowing, that, <Q>though &s;orrow may endure for a night, joy will come in the morning.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="028079_0185_0FD694EFDFAE0BE0">
Thus it is that the Holy Gho&s;t convinces the &s;oul of &s;in. And, if &s;o, how wretchedly are they mi&s;taken, that blend the light of the Spirit with the light of con&s;cience, as all &s;uch do, who &s;ay, that Chri&s;t lighteth every man that cometh into the world, and that light, if improved, will bring us to Je&s;us Chri&s;t? If &s;uch doctrine be true; the promi&s;e in the text was needle&s;s: Our Lord's apo&s;|tles had already that light; the world hereafter to be convinced, had that light; and, if that was &s;uf|ficient to bring them to Chri&s;t, why was it expe|dient that Chri&s;t &s;hould go away to heaven, to &s;end down the Holy Gho&s;t to do this for them? Alas! all have not this Spirit: It is the &s;pecial gift of God, and, without this &s;pecial gift, we can never come to Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The light of con&s;cience will accu&s;e or convince us of any common &s;in: but the light of natural con&s;cience never did, never will, and never can convince us of unbelief: If it could, how comes it to pa&s;s, that not one of the heathens, who improved the light of nature in &s;uch an eminent degree, was ever convinced of unbelief? No <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">atural con&s;cience cannot effect this; it is the peculiar property of the Holy Gho&s;t the Comforter: <Q>When he is come, he will reprove (or convince) the world of &s;in, of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and judgment.</Q></P>
<P>We have heard how he convinces of &s;in: We come now to &s;hew,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> What is the righteou&s;ne&s;s, of which the Comforter convinces the world.</P>
<P>By the word <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> in &s;ome places of &s;crip|ture, we are to under&s;tand that common ju&s;tice which we ought to practice between man and man; as when Paul is &s;aid to rea&s;on of temperance and righteou&s;ne&s;s before a trembling Felix. But here
<PB N="188" REF="028079_0186_0FD694B26111C260">
(as in a multitude of other places in holy writ) we are to under&s;tand by the word righteou&s;ne&s;s, the active and pa&s;&s;ive obedience of the dear Lord Je&s;us; even that perfect, per&s;onal, all-&s;ufficient righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, which he has wrought out for that world which the Spirit is to convince. <Q>Of righteou&s;|ne&s;s, (&s;ays our Lord) becau&s;e I go to the Father, and ye &s;ee me no more.</Q> This is one argument that the Holy Spirit makes u&s;e of to prove Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s, becau&s;e he is gone to the Father, and we &s;ee him no more. For had he not wrought out a &s;ufficient righteou&s;ne&s;s, the Father would have &s;ent him back, as not having done what he under|took: and we &s;hould have &s;een him again.</P>
<P>O the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t! It &s;o comforts my &s;oul, that I mu&s;t be excu&s;ed if I mention it in al|mo&s;t all my di&s;cour&s;es. I would not, if I could help it, have one &s;ermon without it. Whatever infidels may object, or Arminians &s;ophi&s;tically argue again&s;t an imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s; yet whoever know them|&s;elves and God, mu&s;t acknowledge, that <Q>Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the end of the law for righteou&s;ne&s;s, (and perfect ju&s;tification in the &s;ight of God,) to every one that believeth,</Q> and that we are to be made the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in him. This, and this only a poor &s;inner can lay hold of, as a &s;ure anchor of his hope. Whatever other &s;cheme of &s;alvation men may lay, I acknowledge I can &s;ee no other foundation whereon to build my hopes of &s;alvation, but on the rock of Chri&s;t's per&s;onal righteou&s;ne&s;s, imputed to my &s;oul.</P>
<P>Many, I believe, have a rational conviction of, and agree with me in this: But rational convictions, if re&s;ted in, avail but little; it mu&s;t be a &s;piritual, experimental conviction of the truth which is &s;aving. And therefore our Lord &s;ays, when the Holy Gho&s;t
<PB N="189" REF="028079_0187_0FD694F2C81EC028">
comes in the day of his power, it convinces of this righteou&s;ne&s;s, of the reality, completene&s;s and &s;uf|ficiency of it, to &s;ave a poor &s;inner.</P>
<P>We have &s;een how the Holy Gho&s;t convinces the &s;inner of the &s;in of his nature, life, duties, and of the &s;in of unbelief; and what then mu&s;t the poor creature do? He mu&s;t, he mu&s;t inevitably de&s;pair, if there be no hope but in him&s;elf. When therefore the Spirit has hunted the &s;inner out of all his fal&s;e re&s;ts and hiding-places, taken off the pitiful fig-leaves of his own works, and driven him out of the trees of the garden (his outward reformations) and placed him naked before the bar of a &s;overeign, holy, ju&s;t, and &s;in-avenging God; then, then it is, when the &s;oul, having the &s;entence of death within it&s;elf becau&s;e of unbelief; has a &s;weet di&s;play of Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s made to it by the holy Spirit of God. Here it is, that he begins more immediately to act in the quality of a Comforter, and convinces the &s;oul &s;o powerfully of the reality and all-&s;ufficiency of Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s, that the &s;oul is immediately &s;et a hungering and thir&s;t|ing after it. Now the &s;inner begins to &s;ee, that though he has de&s;troyed him&s;elf, yet in Chri&s;t is his help; that, though he has no righteou&s;ne&s;s of his own to recommend him, there is a fulne&s;s of grace, a fulne&s;s of truth, a fulne&s;s of righteou&s;ne&s;s in the dear Lord Je&s;us, which, if once imputed to him, would make him happy for ever and ever.</P>
<P>None can tell, but tho&s;e happy &s;ouls who have experienced it, with what demon&s;tration of the Spirit this conviction comes. O how amiable, as well as all-&s;ufficient, does the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us now ap|pear! With what new eyes does the &s;oul now &s;ee the Lord its righteou&s;ne&s;s! Brethren, it is unutter|able. If you were never thus convinced of Chri&s;t's
<PB N="190" REF="028079_0188_0FD694B450CC81B0">
righteou&s;ne&s;s in your own &s;ouls, though you may believe it doctrinally, it will avail you nothing; if the Comforter never came &s;avingly into your &s;ouls, then you are comfortle&s;s indeed. But</P>
<P>What will this righteou&s;ne&s;s avail, if the &s;oul has it not in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion?</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The next thing therefore the Comforter, when he comes, convinces the &s;oul of, is judgment.</P>
<P>By the word <HI>judgment,</HI> I under&s;tand that well-grounded peace, that &s;ettled judgment, which the &s;oul forms of it&s;elf, when it is enabled by the Spirit of God, to lay hold on Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s, which I believe it always does, when convinced in the manner before-mentioned. "Of judgment, (&s;ays our Lord) <Q>becau&s;e the Prince of this world is judged;</Q> the &s;oul, being enabled to lay hold on Chri&s;t's perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s by a lively faith, has a conviction wrought in it by the Holy Spirit, that the "Prince of this world is judged." The &s;oul being now ju&s;tified by faith, has peace with God, through our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and can trium|phantly &s;ay, it is Chri&s;t that ju&s;tifies me, who is he that condemns me? The &s;trong man armed is now ca&s;t out? my &s;oul is in a true peace; the Prince of this world will come and accu&s;e, but he has now no &s;hare in me: The ble&s;&s;ed Spirit which I have received, and whereby I am enabled to apply Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s to my poor &s;oul power|fully convinces me of this: Why &s;hould I fear? Or of what &s;hall I be afraid, &s;ince God's Spirit wit|ne&s;&s;es with my &s;pirit, that I am a child of God? The Lord is a&s;cended up on high; he has led cap|tivity captive; he has received the Holy Gho&s;t the Comforter, that be&s;t of gifts for men: and that Comforter is come into my heart: he is faithful that hath promi&s;ed: I, even I, am powerfully,
<PB N="191" REF="028079_0189_0FD694F8E25E4F30">
rationally, &s;piritually convicted of &s;in, righteou&s;|ne&s;s, and judgment. By this I know the prince of this world is judged.</P>
<P>Thus, I &s;ay, may we &s;uppo&s;e that &s;oul to triumph, in which the promi&s;e of the text is happily ful|filled. And though, at the beginning of this di&s;|cour&s;e, I &s;aid, mo&s;t had never experienced any thing of this, and that therefore this preaching mu&s;t be fooli&s;hne&s;s to &s;uch; yet I doubt not but there are &s;ome few happy &s;ouls, who, through grace, have been enabled to follow me &s;tep by &s;tep; and notwith&s;tanding the Holy Gho&s;t might not directly work in the &s;ame order as I have de&s;cribed, and perhaps they cannot exactly &s;ay the time when, yet they have a well grounded confidence that the work is done, and that they have really been con|vinced of &s;in, righteou&s;ne&s;s, and judgment, in &s;ome way, or at &s;ome time or another.</P>
<P>And now what &s;hall I &s;ay to you? O thank God, thank the Lord Je&s;us, thank the ever ble&s;&s;ed Trin|ity, for this un&s;peakable gift: For you would never have been thus highly favoured, had not he who fir&s;t &s;poke darkne&s;s into light, loved you with an everla&s;ting love, and enlightened you by his Holy Spirit, and that too, not on account of any good thing fore&s;een in you, but for his own name's &s;ake.</P>
<P>Be humble therefore, O believers be humble: Look to the rock from whence you have been hewn: Extol free grace; admire electing love, which a|lone has made you to differ from the re&s;t of your brethren. Has God brought you into light? Walk as becometh the children of light Provoke not the Holy Spirit to depart from you: For though he hath &s;ealed you to the day of redemption and you know that the Prince of this world is judged;
<PB N="192" REF="028079_0190_0FD694B550B0A0F8">
yet if you back&s;lide, grow lukewarm, or forget your fir&s;t love, the Lord will vi&s;it your offences with the rod of affliction, and your &s;in with &s;piritual &s;courges. Be not therefore high-minded, but fear. Rejoice, but let it be with trembling. As the elect of God, put on, not only humblene&s;s of mind, but bowels of compa&s;&s;ion; and pray, O pray for your unconverted brethren! Help me, help me now, O children of God, and hold up my hands, as Aaron and Hur once held up the hands of Mo&s;es. Pray whil&s;t I am preaching, that the Lord may enable me to &s;ay, This day is the promi&s;e in the text ful|filled in &s;ome poor &s;inners' hearts. Cry mightily to God, and, with the cords of a holy violence, pull down ble&s;&s;ings on your neighbours' heads. Chri&s;t yet lives and reigns in heaven: The re&s;idue of the Spirit is yet in his hand, and a plentiful effu&s;ion of it is promi&s;ed in the latter days of the church. And O that the Holy Gho&s;t, the ble&s;&s;ed Comforter, would now come down, and convince tho&s;e that are Chri&s;t-le&s;s among you, <Q>of &s;in, of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and of judgment!</Q> O that you were once made willing to be convinced!</P>
<P>But perhaps you had rather be filled with wine than with the Spirit, and are daily cha&s;ing that Ho|ly Gho&s;t from your &s;ouls.

Why? <Q>that God was in Chri&s;t reconcil|ing the world unto him&s;elf:</Q> Therefore I be|&s;eech you, as in Chri&s;t's &s;tead, be ye reconciled to God. Do not go away contradicting and bla&s;|pheming. I know Satan would have you begone. Many of you may be unea&s;y, and are ready to cry out, "What a wearine&s;s is this!"

in private, and I mu&s;t wre&s;tle with you here in public. Though of my&s;elf I can do nothing, and you can no more by your own power come to and believe on Chri&s;t, than Lazarus could come forth from the grave; yet who knows but God may be|get &s;ome of you again to a lively hope by this fool|i&s;hne&s;s of preaching, and that you may be &s;ome of that world, which the Comforter is to convince "of &s;in, of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and of judgment?" Poor Chri&s;t le&s;s &s;ouls! do you know what a condition you are in? Why, you are lying in the wicked one, the devil; he rules in you, he walks and dwells in you, unle&s;s you dwell in Chri&s;t, and the Comforter is come into your hearts. And will you contentedly lie in that wicked one the devil? What wages will he give you? Eternal death. O that you would come to Chri&s;t! The free gift of God through him is eternal life. He will accept of you even now, if you will believe in him. The Comforter may yet come into your hearts, even yours. All that are now his living temples, were once lying in the wicked one as well as you. This ble&s;&s;ed gift, this Holy Gho&s;t, the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us re|ceived even for the rebellious.</P>
<P>I &s;ee many of you affected: But are your pa&s;&s;ions only a little wrought upon, or are your &s;ouls really touched with a lively &s;en&s;e of the heinou&s;ne&s;s of your &s;ins, your want of faith, and the preciou&s;ne&s;s of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t? If &s;o, I hope the Lord has been gracious, and that the Comforter is coming into your hearts. O do not &s;tifle the&s;e convictions! Do not go away, and &s;traightway for|get what manner of doctrine you have heard, and thereby &s;hew that the&s;e are only common workings of a few tran&s;ient convictions, floating upon the &s;urface of your hearts.

be &s;incere (for he alone can make you &s;o) and that you may indeed de&s;ire the promi&s;e of the text to be fulfilled in your &s;ouls. Who knows but the Lord may be gracious! Remember you have no plea but &s;overeign mercy; but for your encouragement al&s;o, remember it is the world, &s;uch as you are, to whom the Comforter is to come, and whom he is to con|vince: Wait therefore at Wi&s;dom's gates. The bare probability of having a door of mercy opened, is enough to keep you &s;triving. Chri&s;t Je&s;us came into the world to &s;ave &s;inners, the chief of them: You know not but he came to &s;ave you. Do not go and quarrel with God's decrees, and, if I am a reprobate, I &s;hall be damned; if I am elected, I &s;hall be &s;aved; and therefore I will do nothing. What have you to do with God's decrees? Secret things belong to him; it is your bu&s;ine&s;s to give <Q>all dilligence to make your calling and election &s;ure.</Q> If there are but few who find the way that leads to life, do you &s;trive to be &s;ome of them: You know not but you may be in the number of tho&s;e few, and that your &s;triving may be the means which God intends to ble&s;s, to give you an entrance in. If you do not act thus you are not &s;incere; and, if you do, who knows but you may find mercy? For though after you have done all that you can, God may ju&s;tly cut you off, yet never was a &s;ingle per&s;on damned who did all that he could. Though there|fore your hands are withered, &s;tretch them out; though you are impotent, &s;ick, and lame, come lie at the pool. Who knows but by and by the Lord Je&s;us may have compa&s;&s;ion on you, and &s;end the Comforter to convince you of &s;in, righteou&s;ne&s;s, and of judgment?

<HEAD>THE CONVERSION OF ZACCHEUS.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>LUKE xix. 9, 10.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>And Je&s;us &s;aid unto him, This day is &s;alvation come to this hou&s;e, fora&s;much as he al&s;o is the &s;on of Abra|ham. For the Son of man is come to &s;eek and to &s;ave that which was lo&s;t.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SALVATION, every where through the whole &s;cripture, is &s;aid to be the free gift of God, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord. Not only free, be|cau&s;e God is a &s;overeign agent, and therefore may withhold it from, or confer it on, whom he plea&s;|eth; but free, becau&s;e there is nothing to be found is man, that can any way induce God to be mer|ciful unto him. The righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the &s;ole cau&s;e of our finding favour in God's light: This righteou&s;ne&s;s apprehended by faith (which is al&s;o the gift of God) makes it our own; and this faith, if true, will work by love.</P>
<P>The&s;e are parts of tho&s;e glad tidings which are publi&s;hed in the go&s;pel; and of the certainty of them, next to the expre&s;s word of God, the expe|rience of all &s;uch as have been &s;aved, is the be&s;t, and as I take it, the mo&s;t unbounded proof. That God might teach us every way, he has been plea&s;ed to live upon record many in&s;tances of the power of
<PB N="198" REF="028079_0196_0FD694BF367233B0">
his grace exerted in the &s;alvation, of &s;everal per|&s;ons, that we hearing how he dealt with them, might from thence inter the manner we mu&s;t expect to be dealt with our&s;elves, and learn in what way we mu&s;t look for &s;alvation, if we truly de&s;ire to be made partakers of the inheritance with the &s;aints in light.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ion of the per&s;on referred to in the text, I think will be of no &s;mall &s;ervice to us in this matter, if rightly improved. I would hope, mo&s;t of you know who the per&s;on is, to whom the Lord Je&s;us &s;peaks; it is the Publican Zaccheus, to who&s;e hou&s;e the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us &s;aid, &s;alvation came, and whom he pronounces a &s;on of Abraham.</P>
<P>It is my de&s;ign (God helping) to make &s;ome re|marks upon his conver&s;ion recorded at large in the preceding ver&s;es, and then to inforce the latter part of the text, as an encouragement to po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|done &s;inners to come to Je&s;us Chri&s;t. <Q>For the Son of man is come to &s;eek and to &s;ave that which was lo&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>The evangeli&s;t Luke introduces the account of this man's conver&s;ion thus, ver. 1. <Q>And Je&s;us entered and pa&s;&s;ed through Jericho.</Q> The holy Je&s;us made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to go about doing good. As the &s;un in the firmament is continually &s;preading his benign, quickening, and cheering influences over the natural; &s;o the Son of Righteou&s;ne&s;s aro&s;e with healing under his wings, and was daily and hourly diffu&s;ing his gracious influences over the moral world. The preceding chapter acquaints us of a notable miracle wrought by the holy Je&s;us on a poor blind Bartime<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">; and in this, a greater pre&s;ents it&s;elf to our con&s;ideration. The evangeli&s;t would have us take particular notice of it; for he introduces it with the word behold: <Q>And behold,
<PB N="199" REF="028079_0197_0FD694FEC9E69390">
there was a man named Zaccheus, who was the chief among the Publicans, and he was rich.</Q></P>
<P>Well might the evangeli&s;t u&s;her in the relation of this man's conver&s;ion with the word <HI>behold!</HI> For, according to human judgment, how many in&s;ur|mountable ob&s;tacles lay in the way of it! Surely no, one will &s;ay there was any fitne&s;s in Zaccheus for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">vation; for we are told that he was a Publican, and therefore in all probability a notorious &s;inner. The Publicans were gatherers of the Roman taxes; they were infamous for their abominable extortion; their very name therefore became &s;o odious, that we find the Phari&s;ees often reproached our Lord, as very wicked, becau&s;e he was a friend unto and far down to meat with them. Zaccheus then, being a Publican, was no doubt a &s;inner; and, being chief among the Publicans, con&s;equently was chief among &s;inners. Nay, he was rich. And one in|&s;pired apo&s;tle has told us, that not many mighty, not many noble, are called. Another &s;aith, <Q>God has cho&s;en the poor of this world, rich in faith.</Q> And he who was the Maker and the Redeemer of the apo&s;tles, a&s;&s;ures us, <Q>that it is ea&s;ier for a camel (or cable rope) to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</Q> Let not therefore the rich glory in the multitude of their riches.</P>
<P>But rich as he was, we are told, ver&s;e 3. that "he &s;ought to &s;ee Je&s;us." And that was a wonder indeed! The common people heard our Lord glad|ly, and the poor received the Go&s;pel. The multi|tude, the very mob, the people that knew not the law, as the proud high-prie&s;ts called them, u&s;ed to follow him on foot into the country, and &s;ometimes &s;tayed with him three days together to hear him preach: But did the rich believe or attend on him!
<PB N="200" REF="028079_0198_0FD695262BBF7A68">
No. Our Lord preached up the doctrine of the cro&s;s; he preached too &s;earching for them, and therefore they counted him their enemy, per&s;ecuted and &s;poke all manner of evil again&s;t him, fal&s;ely. Let not the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t marvel, if they meet with the like treatment from the rich men of this wicked and adulterous generation. I &s;hould think it no &s;candal (&s;uppo&s;ing it true) to hear it affirmed, that none but the poor attended my mini&s;try. Their &s;ouls are as precious to our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as the &s;ouls of the greate&s;t men. They were the poor that attended him in the days of his fle&s;h: The&s;e are they whom he hath cho&s;en to be rich in faith, and to be the greate&s;t in the kingdom of heaven. Were the rich in this world's goods generally to &s;peak well of me, woe be unto me; I &s;hould think it a dreadful &s;ign that I was only a wolf in &s;heep's clothing, that I &s;poke peace, peace, when there was no peace, and prophe&s;ied &s;moother things than the go&s;pel would allow of. Hear ye this, O ye rich. Let who will dare to do it, God forbid that I &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e the poor; in doing &s;o, I &s;hould reproach my Maker. The poor are dear to my &s;oul; I rejoice to &s;ee them fly to the doctrine of Chri&s;t, like the doves to their windows. I only pray that the poor who attend, may be evangelized, and turned into the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel: <Q>If &s;o, ble&s;&s;ed are ye; for yours is the kingdom of heaven.</Q></P>
<P>But we mu&s;t return to Zaccheus. He &s;ought to &s;ee Je&s;us. That is good news. I heartily wi&s;h I could &s;ay, it was out of a good principle: But, without &s;peaking contrary to that charity which hopes and believeth all things for the be&s;t, we may &s;ay, that the &s;ame principle drew him after Chri&s;t, which now draws multitudes (to &s;peak plainly, it may be multitudes of you) to hear a particular
<PB N="201" REF="028079_0199_0FD6952BC826B350">
preacher, even curio&s;ity: For we are told, that he came not to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ear his doctrine, but to view his per|&s;on, or to u&s;e the words of the evangeli&s;t, to &s;ee who he was. Our Lord's fame was now &s;pread abroad through all Jeru&s;alem, and all the country round about: Some &s;aid he was a good man; others, nay, but he deceiveth the people. And therefore curio|&s;ity drew out this rich Publican Zaccheus to &s;ee who this per&s;on was, of whom he had heard &s;uch various accounts. But it &s;eems he could not conve|niently get a &s;ight of him for the pre&s;s, and becau&s;e he was little of &s;tature. Alas! how many are kept from &s;eeing Chri&s;t in glory, by rea&s;on of the pre&s;s. I mean, how many are a&s;hamed of being &s;ingularly good, and therefore follow a multitude to do evil, becau&s;e they have a pre&s;s or throng of polite ac|quaintance! And, for fear of being &s;et at nought by tho&s;e with whom they u&s;ed to &s;et at meat, they deny the Lord of glory, and are a&s;hamed to confe&s;s him before men. This ba&s;e, this &s;ervile fear of man, is the bane of true Chri&s;tianity; it brings a dreadful &s;nare upon the &s;oul, and is the ruin of ten thou&s;ands: For I am fully per&s;uaded, numbers are rationally convicted of go&s;pel truths; but, not be|ing able to brook contempt, they will not pro&s;ecute their convictions, nor reduce them to practice. Happy tho&s;e, who in this re&s;pect, at lea&s;t, like Zaccheus, re&s;olved to overcome all impediments that lie in their way to a &s;ight of Chri&s;t: For find|ing he could not &s;ee Chri&s;t becau&s;e of the pre&s;s, and the littlene&s;s of his natural &s;tature, he did not &s;mite upon his brea&s;t, and depart, &s;aying, <Q>It is in vain to &s;eek after a &s;ight of him any longer, I can never attain unto it.</Q> No, finding he could not &s;ee Chri&s;t, if he continued in the mid&s;t of the pre&s;s, <Q>he run before the multitude, and climbed
<PB N="202" REF="028079_0200_0FD628B37B1240E0">
up into a &s;ycamore-tree, to &s;ee him; for he was to pa&s;s that way.</Q></P>
<P>There is no &s;eeing Chri&s;t in glory, unle&s;s we run before the multitude, and are willing to be in the number of tho&s;e de&s;pi&s;ed few, who take the kingdom of God by violence. The broad way, in which &s;o many go, can never be that &s;traight and narrow way which leads to life. Our Lord's flock was, and always will be, comparatively a little one: And unle&s;s we dare to run before the multitude in a holy &s;ingularity, and can rejoice in being accounted fools for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, we &s;hall never &s;ee Je&s;us with comfort, when he appears in glory. From menti|oning the &s;ycamore-tree, and con&s;idering the diffi|culty with which Zaccheus mu&s;t climb it, we may farther learn, that tho&s;e who would &s;ee Chri&s;t, mu&s;t undergo other difficulties and hard&s;hips, be&s;ides con|tempt. Zaccheus, without doubt, went through both. Did not many, think you, laugh at him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he ran along, and in the language of Michal, Saul's daughter, cry out, how glorious did the rich Zac|cheus look to day, when, forgetting the greatne&s;s of his &s;tation, he ran before a pitiful, giddy mob, and climbed up a &s;ycamore-tree, to &s;ee an enthu|&s;ia&s;tic preacher! But Zaccheus cares not for all that; his curio&s;ity was &s;trong: If he could but &s;ee who Je&s;us was, he did not value what &s;coffers &s;aid of him. Thus, and much more will it be with all tho&s;e who have an effectual de&s;ire to &s;ee Je&s;us in heaven: They will go on from &s;trength to &s;trength, break through every difficulty lying in their way, and care not what men or devils &s;ay of or do unto them. May the Lord make us all thus minded, for his dear Son's &s;ake!</P>
<P>At length, after taking much pains, and going (as we may well &s;uppo&s;e) through much contempt,
<PB N="203" REF="028079_0201_0FD695301B82D4D8">
Zaccheus has climbed the tree; and there he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">its, as he thinks, hid in the leaves of it, and watching when he &s;hould &s;ee Je&s;us pa&s;s by: <Q>For he was to pa&s;s by that way.</Q></P>

<P>Ver. 5. <Q>And when Je&s;us came to the place, he looked up, and &s;aw him, and &s;aid unto him, Zaccheus, make ha&s;te and come down; for this day I mu&s;t abide at thy hou&s;e.</Q> Amazing love! Well might Luke u&s;her in the account with behold! It is worthy of our highe&s;t admiration. When Zaccheus thought of no &s;uch thing, nay thought that Chri&s;t Je&s;us did not know him; behold, Chri&s;t does what we never hear he did before or after, I mean, invite him&s;elf to the hou&s;e of Zaccheus, &s;aying, <Q>Zaccheus, make ha&s;te and come down; for this day I mu&s;t abide at thy hou&s;e.</Q> Not pray let me abide, but I mu&s;t abide this day at thy hou&s;e. He al&s;o calls him by name, as though he was well acquainted with him: and indeed well he might; for his name was written in the book of life, he was one of tho&s;e whom the Father had giv|en him from all eternity: therefore he mu&s;t abide at his hou&s;e, that day. <Q>For whom he did pre|de&s;tinate, them he al&s;o called.</Q></P>
<P>Here then, as through a gla&s;s, we may &s;ee the doctrine of free grace evidently exemplified before us. Here was no fitne&s;s in Zaccheus. He was a Publican, chief among the Publicans; not only &s;o, but rich, and came to &s;ee Chri&s;t only out of cu|rio&s;ity: but &s;overeign grace triumphs over all.
<PB N="204" REF="028079_0202_0FD628C8CEEBB7A8">
And if we do God ju&s;tice, and are effectually wrought upon, we mu&s;t acknowledge there was no more fit|ne&s;s in us than in Zaccheus; and, had not Chri&s;t prevented us by his call, we had remained dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, and alienated from the divine life, even as others. <Q>Je&s;us looked up, and &s;aw him, and &s;aid unto him, Zaccheus; make ha&s;te and come down; for this day I mu&s;t abide at thy hou&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>With what different emotions of heart may we &s;uppo&s;e Zaccheus received this invitation? Think you not that he was &s;urpri&s;ed to hear Je&s;us Chri&s;t call him by name, and not only &s;o, but invite him&s;elf to his hou&s;e? Surely, thinks Zaccheus, I dream: it cannot be; how &s;hould he know me? I never &s;aw him before: be&s;ides, I &s;hall undergo much contempt, if I receive him under my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. Thus, I &s;ay, we may &s;uppo&s;e Zaccheus th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> within him&s;elf. But what &s;aith the &s;cripture? <Q>I will make a willing people in the day of my pow|er.</Q> With this outward call, there went an ef|ficacious power from God, which &s;weetly over-ruled his natural will: and therefore, ver&s;e 6. <Q>He made ha&s;te, and came down, and received him joyfully,</Q> not only into his hou&s;e, but al&s;o into his heart.</P>
<P>Thus it is the great God brings home his chil|dren. He calls them by name by his word or pro|vidence; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he &s;peaks to them al&s;o by his Spirit. Hereby they are enabled to open their hearts, and are made willing to receive the King of glory. For Zaccheus' &s;ake, let us not entirely condemn people that come unto the word, out of no better principle than curio&s;ity, Who knows, but God may call them? It is good to be where the Lord is pa&s;&s;ing by. May all who are now pre&s;ent out of this prin|ciple,
<PB N="205" REF="028079_0203_0FD6953299581150">
hear the voice of the Son of God &s;peaking to their &s;ouls, and &s;o hear that they may live! Not that men ought therefore to take encouragement to come out of curio&s;ity. For perhaps a thou&s;and more, at other times, came to &s;ee Chri&s;t out of curio&s;ity, as well as Zaccheus, who were not effectually cal|led by his grace. I only mention this for the en|couragement of my own &s;oul, and the con&s;olation of God's children, who are too apt to be angry with tho&s;e who do not attend on the word out of love to God: but let them alone. Brethren, pray for them. How do you know but Je&s;us Chri&s;t may &s;peak to their hearts? A few words from Chri&s;t applied by his Spirit, will &s;ave their &s;ouls. <Q>Zac|cheus, &s;ays Chri&s;t, make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and come down. And he made ha&s;te, and came down, and re|ceived him joyfully.</Q></P>
<P>I have ob&s;erved in holy &s;cripture, how particu|larly it is remarked, that per&s;ons rejoiced upon be|lieving in Chri&s;t. Thus the converted Eunuch went on his way rejoicing; thus the jailor rejoiced with his whole hou&s;e; thus Zaccheus received Chri&s;t joyfully. And well may tho&s;e rejoice who receive Je&s;us Chri&s;t; for with him they receive righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anctification, and eternal redemp|tion. Many have brought up an ill report upon our good land, and would fain per&s;uade people that religion will make them melancholy mad. So far from it, that joy is one ingredient of the kingdom of God in the heart of a believer; <Q>the kingdom of God is righteou&s;ne&s;s, peace, and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t.</Q> To rejoice in the Lord, is a go&s;|pel duty. Rejoice in the Lord always, and again I &s;ay, rejoice. And who can be &s;o joyful, as tho&s;e who know that their pardon is &s;ealed before they go hence and are no more &s;een? The godly may, but

<P>It &s;hould &s;eem that Zaccheus was under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> but a little while; "perhaps," &s;ays Gu|thric, in his book intitled, the trial concerning a &s;aving intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, <Q>not above a quarter of an hour;</Q> I add, perhaps not &s;o long: For as one ob&s;erves, &s;ometimes the Lord Je&s;us delights in deliver &s;peedily. God is a &s;overeign agent, and works upon his children in their effectual calling, according to the coun&s;el of his eternal will. It is with the &s;piritual, as natural birth: All <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> have not the like pangs; all Chri&s;tians have not the like degree of conviction. But all agree in this, that all have Je&s;us Chri&s;t formed in their hearts! And tho&s;e who have not &s;o many trials at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; may be vi&s;ited with the greater conflicts hereafter; though they never come into bondage again, after they have once received the &s;pirit of adoption. <Q>We have not (&s;ays Paul) received the &s;pirit of bondage again unto fear.</Q> We know not what Zaccheus underwent before he died: However this one thing I know, he now believed in Chri&s;t, and was ju&s;tified, or acquitted, and looked upon as righteous in God's &s;ight, though a Publi|can chief among the Publicans, not many moments before. And thus it is with all, that, like Zac|cheus,
<PB N="207" REF="028079_0205_0FD6953411A28AA8">
receive Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by faith into their hearts.

<P>Say not within your&s;elves this is a licentious, Antinomian doctrine; for this faith, if true, will work by love, and be productive of the fruits of ho|line&s;s. See an in&s;tance in this convert Zaccheus: No &s;ooner had he received Je&s;us Chri&s;t by faith in|to his heart, but he evidences it by his works; For ver. 8. we are <Q>told Zaccheus &s;tood forth, and &s;aid unto the Lord, Behold, Lord, the half of my goods <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> give unto the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by fal&s;e accu&s;ation, I re&s;tore him fourfold.</Q></P>
<P>Having believed on Je&s;us in his heart, he now makes confe&s;&s;ion of him with his mouth to &s;alva|tion. Zaccheus &s;tood forth: He was not a&s;hamed, but &s;tood forth before his brother Publicans; for true faith ca&s;ts out all &s;ervile, &s;inful fear of men; <Q>And &s;aid, Behold, Lord.</Q> It is remarkable, how readily people in &s;cripture have owned the divinity of Chri&s;t immediately, upon their conver&s;ion. Thus the woman at Jacob's well; <Q>Is not this the Chri&s;t? Thus the man born blind; Lord, I believe; and wor&s;hipped him.</Q> Thus Zaccheus, "Behold, Lord." An inconte&s;title proof this to me, that tho&s;e who deny our Lord's divinity, never effectually felt his power: If they had, they would not &s;peak &s;o lightly of him; they would &s;corn to deny his eternal power and God|head. <Q>Zaccheus &s;tood forth, and &s;aid, Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor, and if I have taken any thing from any man by

fal&s;e accu&s;ation, I re&s;tore him fourfold.</Q> No|ble fruits of a true living faith in the Lord Je&s;us! Every word calls for our notice. Not &s;ome &s;mall, not the tenth part, but the half. Of what? My goods; things that were valuable. My goods, his own, not another's: I give: Not, I will give when I die, when I can keep them no longer; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, I give now, even now. Zaccheus would be his own ex|ecutor. For whil&s;t we have time we &s;hould do good. But to whom would he give half of his goods? Not to the rich, not to tho&s;e who were al|ready clothed in purple and fine linnen, of whom he might be recompen&s;ed again; but to the poor, the maimed, the halt, the blind, from which he could expect no recompen&s;e till the re&s;urrection of the dead. "I give to the poor." But knowing that he mu&s;t be ju&s;t, before be could be charitable, and con&s;cious to him&s;elf that in his public admini&s;tra|tions he had wronged many per&s;ons, he adds, <Q>And, If I have taken any thing from any man by fal&s;e accu&s;ation, I re&s;tore him fourfold.</Q> Hear ye this, all ye that make no con&s;cience of cheating the king of his taxes, or of buying or &s;elling run goods. If ever God gives you true faith you will never re&s;t, till, like Zaccheus, you have made re&s;ti|tution to the utmo&s;t of your power. I &s;uppo&s;e, be|fore his conver&s;ion he thought it no harm to cheat thus, no more than you may do now, and plea&s;ed him&s;elf frequently, to be &s;ure, that he got rich by doing &s;o: But now he is grieved for it at his heart; he confe&s;&s;es his inju&s;tice before men, and promi&s;es to make ample re&s;titution. Go, ye cheating Pub|licans, learn of Zaccheus, go away and do like|wi&s;e; if you do not make re&s;titution here, the Lord Je&s;us &s;hall make you confe&s;s your &s;ins before men and angels, and condemn you for it, when he
<PB N="209" REF="028079_0207_0FD6953730B26E40">
comes in the glory of his Father to judgment here|after.</P>
<P>After all this, with good rea&s;on might our Lord &s;ay unto him, <Q>This day is &s;alvation come to this hou&s;e; fora&s;much as he is the &s;on of Abraham;</Q> not &s;o much by a natural as by a &s;piritual birth. He was made partaker of like precious faith with Abraham: Like Abraham, he believed on the Lord, and it was accounted to him for righteou&s;|ne&s;s: His faith, like Abraham's, worked by love; and I doubt not, but he has been long &s;ince &s;itting In Abraham's harbour.</P>
<P>And now are you not a&s;hamed of your&s;elves, who &s;peak again&s;t the doctrines of grace e&s;pecially that doctrine of being ju&s;tified by faith alone, as though it leaded to licentiou&s;ne&s;s? What can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> more unju&s;t than &s;uch a charge? Is not the in|&s;tance of Zaccheus a &s;ufficient proof to the contra|ry? Have I &s;trained it to &s;erve my own turn? God forbid. To the be&s;t of my knowledge I have &s;poken the truth in &s;incerity, and the truth as it is in Je&s;us. I do affirm that we are &s;aved by grace, and that we are ju&s;tified by faith alone: But I do al&s;o affirm, that faith mu&s;t be evidenced by good works where there is an opportunity of performing them.</P>
<P>What therefore has been &s;aid of Zaccheus, may &s;erve as a rule, whereby all may judge whether they have faith or not, You &s;ay you have faith; but how do you prove it? Did you ever hear the Lord Je&s;us call you by name? Were you ever made to obey that call? Did you ever, like Zaccheus, re|ceive Je&s;us Chri&s;t joyfully into your hearts? Are you influenced, by the faith you &s;ay you have, to &s;tand up and confe&s;s the Lord Je&s;us before men? Were you ever made willing to own, and humble your&s;elves for, your pa&s;t offences? Does your
<PB N="210" REF="028079_0208_0FD695071461B278">
faith work by love, &s;o that you con&s;cientiou&s;ly lay up, according as God has pro&s;pered you, for the &s;upport of the poor? Do you give alms of all things that you po&s;&s;e&s;s? And have you made due re&s;titu|tion to tho&s;e you have wronged? If &s;o, happy are ye; &s;alvation is come to your &s;ouls; you are &s;ons, you are daughters of, you &s;hall &s;hortly be everla&s;t|ingly ble&s;&s;ed with faithful Abraham. But, if you are not thus minded, do not deceive your own &s;ouls; though you may talk of ju&s;tification by faith, like angels, it will do you no good; it will only increa&s;e your damnation. You hold the truth, but it is in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s: Your faith being without works, is dead; you have the devil, not Abraham, for your father. Unle&s;s you get a faith of the heart, a faith working by love, with devils and damned &s;pirits &s;hall you dwell for evermore.</P>
<P>But it is now time to enforce the latter part of the text; <Q>For the Son of man is come to &s;eek and to &s;ave that which was lo&s;t.</Q> The&s;e words are &s;poken by our Saviour, in an&s;wer to &s;ome &s;elf-righ|teous Phari&s;ees, who in&s;tead of rejoicing with the angels in heaven, at the conver&s;ion of &s;uch a &s;inner, murmured, <Q>that he was gone to be gue&s;t with a man that was a &s;inner.</Q> To vindicate his con|duct, he tells them, that this was an act agreeable to the de&s;ign of his coming; <Q>For the Son of man is come to &s;eek and to &s;ave that which was lo&s;t.</Q> He might have &s;aid, the "Son of God." But O the wonderful conde&s;cen&s;ion of our Redeemer! He delights to &s;tyle him&s;elf the Son of man. He came not only to &s;ave, <Q>but to &s;eek and to &s;ave that which was lo&s;t.</Q> He came to Jericho to &s;eek and &s;ave Zaccheus; for otherwi&s;e Zaccheus would nev|er have been &s;aved by him. But from whence came he? Even from heaven, his dwelling-place, to this lower earth, this vale of tears, <Q>to &s;eek and &s;ave
<PB N="211" REF="028079_0209_0FD69538F340ED08">
that which was lo&s;t;</Q> or all that feel them&s;elves lo&s;t, and are willing, like Zaccheus, to receive him into their hearts to &s;ave them; with how great a &s;alvation? even from the guilt, and al&s;o from the power of their &s;ins; to make them heirs of God, and joint heirs with him&s;elf, and partakers of that glory which he enjoyed with the Father before the world began. Thus will the Son of man &s;ave that which is lo&s;t. He was made the Son of man, on purpo&s;e that he might &s;ave them. He had no other end but this in leaving his Father's throne, in obeying the moral law, and hanging upon the cro&s;s: All that was done and &s;uffered, merely to &s;atisfy, and procure a righteou&s;ne&s;s for poor, lo&s;t undone &s;inners, and that too without re&s;pect of per&s;ons. "That which was lo&s;t:" all of every nation and language, that feel, bewail, and are truly de&s;irous of being delivered from their lo&s;t &s;tate, did the Son of man come down to &s;eek and to &s;ave: For he is mighty, not only &s;o, but willing, to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t all that come to God thro' him; he will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t them out. For he is the &s;ame to-day, as he was ye&s;terday. He comes now to &s;inners, as well as formerly; and, I hope, hath &s;eat me out this day to &s;eek, and, under him, to bring home &s;ome of you, the lo&s;t &s;heep of the hou&s;e of I&s;rael.</P>
<P>What &s;ay you? Shall I go home rejoicing, &s;ay|ing, that many like &s;heep, have gone a&s;tray, but they have now believed on Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and &s;o re|turned home to the great Shepherd and Bi&s;hop of their &s;ouls? If the Lord would be plea&s;ed thus to pro&s;per my handy-work, I care not how many le|gali&s;ts and &s;elf-righteous Phari&s;ees murmur again&s;t me, for offering &s;alvation to the wor&s;t of &s;inners; For I know the Son of man came to &s;eek and to &s;ave them; and the Lord Je&s;us will now be a gue&s;t to

the wor&s;t Publican, the vile&s;t &s;inner that is among&s;t you, if he does but believe on him. Make ha&s;te then, O &s;inners, make ha&s;te, and come by faith to Chri&s;t. Then, this day, even this hour, nay this moment, if you believe, Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hall come and make his eternal abode in your hearts. Which of you is made willing to receive the King of glory? Which of you obeys the call, as Zac|cheus did? Alas! why do you &s;tand &s;till? How know you, whether Je&s;us Chri&s;t may ever call you again? Come then, poor, guilty &s;inners; come away, poor, lo&s;t, undone Publicans: Make ha&s;te, I &s;ay, and come away to Je&s;us Chri&s;t. The Lord conde&s;cends to invite him&s;elf to come under the filthy roofs of the hou&s;es of your &s;ouls. Do not be afraid of entertaining him; he will fill you with all peace and joy in believing. Do not be a&s;hamed to run before the multitude, and to have all manner of evil &s;poken again&s;t you fal&s;ely for his &s;ake: One &s;ight of Chri&s;t will make amends for all. Zaccheus was laughed at; and <Q>all that will live godly in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, &s;hall &s;uffer per&s;ecution.</Q> But what of that? Zaccheus is now crowned in glory; as you al&s;o &s;hall &s;hortly be, if you believe on, and are re|proached for Chri&s;t's &s;ake. Do not, therefore, put me off with frivolous excu&s;es; there is no excu&s;e can be given for your not coming to Chri&s;t. You are lo&s;t, undone, without him; and if he is not glori|fied in your &s;alvation, he will be glorified in your de&s;truction: if he does not come and make his abode in your hearts, you mu&s;t take up an eternal abode with the devil and his angels. O that the Lord would be plea&s;ed to pa&s;s by &s;ome of you at this time! O that he may call you by his Spirit, and make you a willing people in this day of his power! For I know my calling will not do, unle&s;s he, by his efficacious grace, compel you to come in. O that
<PB N="213" REF="028079_0211_0FD6953A1983DC40">
you once felt what it is to receive Je&s;us Chri&s;t into your hearts! You would &s;oon, like Zaccheus, give him every thing. You do not love Chri&s;t, becau&s;e you do not know him; you do not come to him, becau&s;e you do not feel your want of him: you are whole and not broken-hearted; you are not &s;ick, at lea&s;t not &s;en&s;ible of your &s;ickne&s;s; and, therefore, no wonder you do not apply to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that great, that almighty phy&s;ician. You do not feel your&s;elves lo&s;t, and therefore do not &s;eek to be found in Chri&s;t. O that God would wound you with the &s;word of his Spirit, and cau&s;e his arrows of convic|tion to &s;tick deep in your hearts! O that he would dart a ray of divine light into your &s;ouls! For if you do not feel your&s;elves lo&s;t without Chri&s;t, you are of all men mo&s;t mi&s;erable: your &s;ouls are dead; you are not only an image of hell, but in &s;ome degree hell it|&s;elf: you carry hell about with you, and you know it not. O that I could &s;ee &s;ome of you &s;en&s;ible of this, and hear you cry out, <Q>Lord, break this hard heart; Lord, deliver me from the body of this death; draw me, Lord make me willing to come after thee; I am lo&s;t; Lord, &s;ave me, or I peri&s;h!</Q> Was this your ca&s;e, how &s;oon would the Lord &s;tretch forth his almighty hand, and &s;ay, be of good cheer, it is I; be not afraid? What a wonderful calm would then po&s;&s;e&s;s your troubled &s;ouls! Your fellow|&s;hip would then be with the Father and the Son: Your life would be hid with Chri&s;t in God.</P>
<P>Some of you, I hope, have experienced this, and can &s;ay, I was lo&s;t, but I am found; I was dead, but am alive again. The Son of man came and &s;ought me in the day of his power, and &s;aved my &s;inful &s;oul. And do you repent that you came to Chri&s;t? Has he not been a good Ma&s;ter? Is not his pre&s;ence &s;weet to your &s;ouls? Has he not been faith|ful

to his promi&s;e? And have you not found, that even in doing and &s;uffering for him, there is an exceeding pre&s;ent great reward? I am per&s;uaded you will an&s;wer, Yes.

And who knows but the Lord may make you fi&s;her of men? The &s;tory of Zaccheus was left on record for this purpo&s;e. No truly convicted &s;oul, after &s;uch an in&s;tance of divine grace has been laid before him, need de&s;pair of mercy, What if you are Publicans? Was not Zaccheus a Publican? What if you are chief among the Publicans? Was not Zaccheus likewi&s;e? What if you are rich? Was not Zaccheus rich al&s;o? And yet almighty grace made him more than conqueror over all the&s;e hin|drances. All things are po&s;&s;ible to Je&s;us Chri&s;t&punc; nothing is too hard for him: he is the Lord almigh|ty.

<Q><HI>That I may know him, and the power of his re&s;urrection.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE apo&s;tle, in the ver&s;es before the text, had been cautioning the Philippians to beware of the conci&s;ion, Judaizing teachers, who endea|voured to &s;ubvert them from the &s;implicity of the go&s;pel, by telling them, they &s;till ought to be &s;ub|ject to circumci&s;ion and all the other ordinances of Mo&s;es. And that they might not think he &s;poke out of prejudice, and condemned their tenets be|cau&s;e he him&s;elf was a &s;tranger to the Jewi&s;h di&s;|pen&s;ation, he acquaints them, that if any other man thought he had whereof he might tru&s;t in the fle&s;h, or &s;eek to be ju&s;tified by the outward privi|leges of the jews, he had more: for he was circum|ci&s;ed the eighth day; of the &s;tock of I&s;rael, (not a pro&s;elyte, but a native I&s;raelite;) of the tribe of Benjamin, (the tribe which adhered to Judah when the others revolted;) an Hebrew of the Hebrews, (a Jew both of the father and mother's &s;ide;) and as touching the law, a Phari&s;ee, the &s;tricte&s;t &s;ect among&s;t all I&s;rael. To &s;hew that he was no Gallio in religion, through his great, though mi&s;guided zeal, he had per&s;ecuted the church of Chri&s;t; and as touching the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the law (as far as the
<PB N="217" REF="028079_0215_0FD69542D1D43198">
Phari&s;ee's expo&s;ition of it went) he was blamele&s;s, and had kept it from his youth. But, when it plea&s;ed God, who &s;eparated him from his mother's womb, to reveal his Son in him, What things were gain to me, (he &s;ays) tho&s;e privileges <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> boa&s;ted my&s;elf in, and &s;ought to be ju&s;tified by. I counted lo&s;s for Chri&s;t. And that they might not think he repented that he had done &s;o, he tells them, he was now more confirmed than ever in his judgment. For, &s;ays he, "yea, doubtle&s;s," (the expre&s;&s;ion in the original ri&s;es with a holy triumph) <Q>and do count all things but lo&s;s for the excellency of the knowledge of Chri&s;t Je&s;us my Lord.</Q> And that they might not object that he &s;aid, and did not, he acquaints them, he had given proofs of the &s;incerity of the&s;e profe&s;&s;ions, becau&s;e for the &s;ake of them, he had &s;uffered the lo&s;s of all his worldly things, and &s;till was willing to do more; for, <Q>I count them but dung (no more than offals th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> out to dogs) &s;o that I may win, (or have a &s;aving intere&s;t in) Chri&s;t, and be found in him, (as the man&s;layer in the city of refuge) not having my own righteou&s;ne&s;s, which is of the law,</Q> not de|pending on having Abraham for my father, or on any works of righteou&s;ne&s;s which I have done, either to atone or &s;erve as a balance for my evil deeds, but that which is through the faith of Chri&s;t, the righ|teou&s;ne&s;s which is of God by faith, a righteou&s;ne&s;s of God's appointing, and which will be imputed to me, if I believe in Chri&s;t, <Q>that I may know him, and the power of his re&s;urrection;</Q> that I may have an experimental knowledge of the efficacy of his re&s;urrection, by feeling the influences of his ble&s;&s;ed Spirit on my &s;oul. In which words two things are implied.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> Je&s;us Chri&s;t did ri&s;e from the dead.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="028079_0216_0FD6950D13E38998">
<HI>Secondly,</HI> That it highly concerns us to know the power of his ri&s;ing again.</P>
<P>Accordingly in the following di&s;cour&s;e I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That Chri&s;t is ri&s;en indeed from the dead; and that it was nece&s;&s;ary for him &s;o to do; and,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That it highly concerns us to know and experience the power of his re&s;urrection:</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Chri&s;t is indeed ri&s;en.</P>
<P>That Je&s;us &s;hould ri&s;e from the dead was ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> On his own account. He had often ap|pealed to this as the la&s;t and mo&s;t convincing proof he would give them that he was the true Me&s;&s;iah, <Q>There &s;hall no other &s;ign be given you, than the prophet Jonas. And again, De&s;troy this temple of my body, and in three days I will build it up.</Q> Which words his enemies remembered, and urged it as an argument, to induce Pilate to grant them a watch, to prevent his being &s;tolen out of the grave. <Q>We know that deceiver &s;aid, whil&s;t he was yet alive after three days I will ri&s;e again.</Q> So that had he not ri&s;en again, they might have ju&s;tly &s;aid, we know that this man was an impo&s;tor.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Secondly,</HI> It was nece&s;&s;ary on our account. <Q>He ro&s;e again, &s;ays the apo&s;tle, for our ju&s;tifica|tion;</Q> or that the debt we owed to God for our &s;ins, might be fully &s;atisfied and di&s;charged.</P>
<P>It had plea&s;ed the Father (for ever adored be his infinite love and free grace) to wound his only Son for our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and to arre&s;t and confine him in the pri&s;on of the grave, as our &s;urety for the guilt we had contracted by &s;etting at nought his commandments. Now had Chri&s;t continued always in the grave, we could have had no more a&s;&s;urance that our &s;ins were &s;atisfied for, than any common
<PB N="219" REF="028079_0217_0FD69545AB217D18">
debtor can have of his creditor's being &s;atisfied, whil&s;t his &s;urety is kept confined. But he being relea&s;ed from the power of death, we are thereby a&s;&s;ured, that with his &s;acrifice God was well plea&s;|ed, that our atonement was fini&s;hed on the cro&s;s, and that he had made a full, perfect, and &s;ufficient &s;acrifice, oblation, and &s;atisfaction for the &s;ins of the world.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> It was nece&s;&s;ary that our Lord Je&s;us &s;hould ri&s;e again from the dead, to a&s;&s;ure us of the certainty of the re&s;urrection of our own bodies.</P>
<P>The doctrine of the re&s;urrection of the body was entirely exploded and &s;et at nought among the Gen|tiles, as appears from the Athenians mocking at, and calling St. Paul a babbler and a &s;etter forth of &s;trange doctrines, when he preached to them Je&s;us, and the re&s;urrection. And though it was believed by mo&s;t of the Jews, as is evident from many pa&s;|&s;ages of &s;cripture, yet not by all; the whole &s;ect of the Sadducees denied it. But the re&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t put it out of di&s;pute. For as he acted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s our repre&s;entative, if he our Head be ri&s;en, then mu&s;t we al&s;o, who are his members, ri&s;e with him. And as in the fir&s;t Adam we all died, even &s;o in him our &s;econd Adam we mu&s;t all, in this &s;en&s;e, be made alive.</P>
<P>As it was nece&s;&s;ary, upon the&s;e accounts, that our ble&s;&s;ed Lord &s;hould ri&s;e from the dead; &s;o it is plain beyond contradiction, that he did. Never was any matter of fact better atte&s;ted; never were more precautions made u&s;e of to prevent a cheat. He was buried in a &s;epulchre, hewn out of a rock, &s;o that it could not be &s;aid that any digged under, and conveyed him away. It was a &s;epulchre al&s;o wherein never man before was laid; &s;o that if any body did ri&s;e from thence, it mu&s;t be the body of
<PB N="220" REF="028079_0218_0FD6950EF42EEAD0">
Je&s;us of Nazareth. Be&s;ides, the &s;epulchre was &s;ealed; a great &s;tone rolled over the mouth of it; and a band of &s;oldiers (con&s;i&s;ting not of friends, but of his profe&s;&s;ed enemies) was &s;et to guard it. And as for his di&s;ciples coming by night and &s;tealing him away, it was altogether improbable: for it was not long &s;ince, that they had all for&s;aken him, and they were the mo&s;t backward in believing his re&s;urrection. And &s;uppo&s;ing it was true that they came whil&s;t the &s;oldiers &s;lept; yet the &s;oldiers m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t be ca&s;t into a deep &s;leep indeed, that the rolling away &s;o great a &s;tone did not awake &s;ome of them.</P>
<P>And our ble&s;&s;ed Lord's afterwards appearing at &s;undry times, and in divers manners, to his di&s;|ciples, as when they were a&s;&s;embled together, when they were walking to Emmaus, when they were fi&s;hing; nay, and conde&s;cending to &s;hew them his hands and feet, and his appearing to above five hundred brethren at once, put the truth of his re|&s;urrection out of all di&s;pute.</P>
<P>Indeed there is one objection that may be made again&s;t what has been &s;aid, that the books wherein the&s;e facts are recorded were written by his di&s;|ciples.</P>
<P>And who more proper per&s;ons than tho&s;e who were eye-witne&s;&s;es of what they related, and eat and drank with him after his re&s;urrection? <Q>But they were illiterate and ignorant men.</Q> Yet as good witne&s;&s;es of a plain matter of fact, as the mo&s;t learned ma&s;ters in I&s;rael. Nay, this rendered them more proper witne&s;&s;es. For being plain men, they were therefore le&s;s to be &s;u&s;pected of telling or making a lie, particularly, &s;ince they laid down their lives for a te&s;timony of the truth of it. We read indeed of Jacob's telling a lie, though he was a plain man, in order to get his father's ble&s;&s;ing.
<PB N="221" REF="028079_0219_0FD69546CD329210">
But it was never heard &s;ince the world began, that any man, much le&s;s a whole &s;et of men, died mar|tyrs for the &s;ake of an untruth, when they them|&s;elves were to reap no advantage from it.</P>
<P>No, this &s;ingle circum&s;tance proves them to be I&s;raelites indeed, in whom was no guile. And the wonderful &s;ucce&s;s God gave to their mini&s;try after|wards, when three thou&s;and were converted by one &s;ermon; and twelve poor fi&s;hermen, in a very &s;hort time enabled to be more than conquerors over all the oppo&s;ition men or devils could make, was as plain a demon&s;tration, that Chri&s;t was ri&s;en, ac|cording to their go&s;pel, as that a divine power, at the &s;ound of a few ram horns, c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;ed the wall of Jericho to fall down.</P>
<P>But what need we any farther witne&s;&s;es? Believe you the re&s;urrection of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord? I know that you believe it, as your gathering together on this fir&s;t day of the week in the courts of the Lord's hou&s;e abundantly te&s;tifies.</P>
<P>What concerns us mo&s;t to be a&s;&s;ured of, and which is the</P>
<P><HI>Second</HI> thing I was to &s;peak to, is, Whether we have experimentally known the power of his re&s;ur|rection; that is, Whether or not we have received the Holy Gho&s;t, and by his powerful operations on our hearts, have been rai&s;ed from the death of &s;in, to a life of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and true holine&s;s.</P>
<P>It was this, the great apo&s;tle was chiefly de&s;irous to know: the re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t's body he was &s;atisfied would avail him nothing, unle&s;s he expe|rienced the power of it in rai&s;ing his dead &s;oul.</P>
<P>For another, and that a chief end of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord's ri&s;ing from the dead, was to enter heaven as our repre&s;entative, and to &s;end down the Holy Gho&s;t to apply that redemption he had fini&s;hed on
<PB N="222" REF="028079_0220_0FD6951014C8C918">
the cro&s;s, to our hearts, by working an entire change in them.</P>
<P>Without this, Chri&s;t would have died in vain. For it would have done us no &s;ervice to have had his outward righteou&s;ne&s;s imputed to us, unle&s;s we had an inward inherent righteou&s;ne&s;s wrought in us. Becau&s;e, being altogether conceived and born in &s;in, and con&s;equently unfit to hold communion with an infinitely pure and holy God, we cannot po&s;&s;ibly be made meet to &s;ee or enjoy him, till a thorough renovation has pa&s;&s;ed upon our hearts.</P>
<P>Without this we leave out the Holy Gho&s;t in the great work of our redemption. But as we were made by the joint concurrence and con&s;ultation of the ble&s;&s;ed Trinity; and as we were baptized in their name, &s;o mu&s;t all of them concur in our &s;al|vation: as the Father made, and the Son redeemed, &s;o mu&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t &s;anctify and &s;eal us, or other|wi&s;e we have believed in vain.</P>
<P>This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> is what the apo&s;tle means by the power of Chri&s;t's re&s;urrection, and this is what we are as much concerned experimentally to know, as that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> all.</P>
<P>Without this, though we may be morali&s;ts, tho' we may be civilized, good-natured people, yet we are no Chri&s;tians. For he is not a true Chri&s;tian, who is only one outwardly; nor have we therefore a right, becau&s;e we daily profe&s;s, to believe that Chri&s;t ro&s;e again the third day from the dead. But he is a true Chri&s;tian who is one inwardly, and then only can we be &s;tyled true believers, when we not only profe&s;s to believe, but have felt the power of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord's ri&s;ing from the dead, by being quick|ened and rai&s;ed by his Spirit, when dead in tre&s;|pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, to a thorough newne&s;s both of heart and life.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="028079_0221_0FD695493B61DFB0">
The devils them&s;elves cannot but believe the doctrine of the re&s;urrection, and tremble; but yet they continue devils, becau&s;e the benefits of this re&s;urrection have not been applied to them, nor have they received a renovating power from it, to change and put off their diabolical nature. And &s;o, unle&s;s we not only profe&s;s to know, but al&s;o feel that Chri&s;t is ri&s;en indeed, by being born again from above, we &s;hall be as far from the kingdom of God as they: our faith will be as ineffectual as the faith of devils.</P>
<P>Nothing has done more harm to the Chri&s;tian world, nothing has rendered the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t of le&s;s effect, than a vain &s;uppo&s;ition, that religion is &s;omething without us. Whereas we &s;hould con&s;ider, that every thing that Chri&s;t did outwardly, mu&s;t be done over again in our &s;ouls; or otherwi&s;e, the believing there was &s;uch a divine Per&s;on once on earth who triumphed over hell and the grave, will profit us no more than believing there was once &s;uch a per&s;on as Alexander who conquered the world.</P>
<P>As Chri&s;t was born of the Virgin's womb, &s;o mu&s;t he be &s;piritually formed in our hearts. As he died for &s;in, &s;o mu&s;t we die to &s;in. And as he ro&s;e again, from the dead, &s;o mu&s;t we al&s;o ri&s;e to a divine life.</P>
<P>None but tho&s;e who have followed him in this re|generation, or new-birth, &s;hall &s;it on thrones as ap|provers of his &s;entence, when he &s;hall come in ter|rible maje&s;ty to judge the twelve tribes of I&s;rael.</P>
<P>It is true, as for the outward work of our redemp|tion, it was a tran&s;ient act, and was certainly fini&s;h|ed on the cro&s;s; but the application of that redemp|tion to our hearts, is a work that will continue always even unto the end of the world.</P>
<P>So long as there is an elect man breathing on the earth, who is naturally engendered of the offspring of the fir&s;t Adam, &s;o long mu&s;t the quickening Spi|rit,
<PB N="224" REF="028079_0222_0FD69511EF0C6F00">
which was purcha&s;ed by the re&s;urrection of the &s;econd Adam, that Lord from heaven, be breath|ing upon his &s;oul.</P>
<P>For though we may exi&s;t by Chri&s;t, yet we cannot be &s;aid to exi&s;t in him, till we are united to him by one &s;pirit, and enter into a new &s;tate of things, as certainly as he entered into a new &s;tate of things, after that he ro&s;e from the dead.</P>
<P>We may throng and crowd round about Chri&s;t, and call him Lord, Lord, when we come to wor|&s;hip before his foot&s;tool; but we have not effectually touched him, till by a lively faith in his re&s;urrection, we perceive a divine virtue coming out of him, to renew and purify our &s;ouls.</P>
<P>How greatly then do they err who re&s;t in a bare hi&s;torical faith of our Saviour's re&s;urrection, and look only for external proofs to evidence it? Where|as were we the mo&s;t learned di&s;puters of this world, and could &s;peak of the certainty of this fact with the tongue of men and angels, yet without this inward te&s;timony of it in our hearts, though we might con|vince others, yet we &s;hould never be &s;aved by it our&s;elves.</P>
<P>For we are but dead men, we are like &s;o many carca&s;es wrapt up in grave clothes, till that &s;ame Je&s;us who called Lazarus from his tomb, and at who&s;e own re&s;urrection many that &s;lept aro&s;e, doth rai&s;e us al&s;o by his quickening Spirit from our na|tural death, in which we have &s;o long lain, to a holy and heavenly life.</P>
<P>We might think our&s;elves happy, if we had &s;een the holy Je&s;us after he was ri&s;en from the dead, and our hands had handled that Lord of life. But more happy are they who have not &s;een him, and yet having felt the power of his re&s;urrection, therefore believe in him. For many &s;aw our divine Ma&s;ter,
<PB N="225" REF="028079_0223_0FD6954CDAA99F60">
who were not &s;aved by him; but who&s;oever has thus felt the power of his re&s;urrection, has the earne&s;t of his inheritance in his heart, he has pa&s;&s;ed from death to life, and &s;hall never fall into final condemnation.</P>
<P>I am very &s;en&s;ible that this is fooli&s;hne&s;s to the natural man, as were many &s;uch like truths to our Lord's own di&s;ciples, when only weak in faith, be|fore he ro&s;e again. But when th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e natural men, like them, have fully felt the power of his re&s;ur|rection, they will then own that this doctrine is from God, and &s;ay with the Samaritans, <Q>Now we believe not becau&s;e of thy &s;aying,</Q> for we our&s;elves have experienced it in our hearts.</P>
<P>And O that all unbelievers, all letter-learned ma&s;|ters of I&s;rael, who now look upon the doctrine of the power of Chri&s;t's re&s;urrection, or our new birth as an idle tale, and condemn the preachers of it as en|thu&s;ia&s;ts and madmen, did but thus feel the power of it in their &s;ouls, they would no longer a&s;k, how this thing could be? But they would be convinced of it as much as Thomas was, when he &s;aw the Lord's Chri&s;t; and like him, when Je&s;us bid him reach out his hands and thru&s;t them into his &s;ide, in a holy confu|&s;ion they would cry out, "My Lord, and my God!"</P>
<P>But how &s;hall an unbeliever, how &s;hall the formal Chri&s;tian come thus to <Q>know Chri&s;t, and the pow|er of his re&s;urrection?</Q> God, who cannot lie, has told us, <Q>I am the re&s;urrection and the life, who|&s;oever liveth and believeth in me, though he were dead, yet &s;hall he live. Again &s;ays the apo&s;tle, By faith we are &s;aved, and that not of our&s;elves, it is the gift of God.</Q></P>
<P>This, this is the way, walk in it. Believe and you &s;hall live in Chri&s;t, and Chri&s;t in you; you &s;hall be one with Chri&s;t, and Chri&s;t one with you. But without this, your outward goodne&s;s and pro|fe&s;&s;ions will avail you nothing.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="028079_0224_0FD695131E13EBB0">
But then, by this faith we are not to under&s;tand a dead &s;peculative faith, a faith in the head; but a living principle wrought in the heart by the pow|erful operations of the Holy Gho&s;t, a faith that will enable us to overcome the world and for&s;ake all in affection for Je&s;us Chri&s;t. For thus &s;peaks our ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter. <Q>Unle&s;s a man for&s;ake all that he hath, he cannot be my di&s;ciple.</Q></P>
<P>And &s;o the apo&s;tle, in the words immediately following the text, &s;ays, <Q>being made conformable to his death;</Q> thereby implying, that we cannot know the power of Chri&s;t's re&s;urrection unle&s;s we are made conformable to him in his death.</P>
<P>This we have &s;hadowed out by the cu&s;tom of bap|tizing by immer&s;ion in the primitive church, and (which is al&s;o recommended by our own) their put|ing the infants under the water, &s;ignified their obli|gation to die unto &s;in; as their taking them out of the water, &s;ignified their ri&s;ing again to newne&s;s of life. To which the apo&s;tle plainly alludes, when he &s;ays, we are buried with him in bapti&s;m."</P>
<P>If we can reconcile light and darkne&s;s, heaven and hell, then we may hope to know the power of Chri&s;t's re&s;urrection without dying to our&s;elves and the world. But till we can do this, we might as well expect that Chri&s;t will have concord with Belial.</P>
<P>For there is &s;uch a contrariety between the &s;pirit of this world, and the &s;pirit of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that he who will be at friend&s;hip with the one, mu&s;t be at enmity with the other: We cannot &s;erve God and mammon."</P>
<P>This may, indeed, &s;eem a hard &s;aying; and ma|ny, with the young man in the go&s;pel, may be tempted to go away &s;orrowful: but wherefore &s;hould this offend them? For what is all that is in the world, the lu&s;t of the eye, the lu&s;t of the fle&s;h, and the pride of life, but vanity and vexation of &s;pirit?</P>

God is love; and therefore, could our own wills, or the world, have made us happy, he never would have &s;ent his own dear Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t to die and ri&s;e again, to deliver us from the power of them. But becau&s;e they only torment and cannot &s;atisfy, therefore God bids us to renounce them.</P>
<P>Had any one per&s;uaded profane E&s;au not to lo&s;e &s;o glorious a privilege, merely for the &s;ake of gratify|ing a pre&s;ent corrupt inclination, when he &s;aw him about to &s;ell his birth-right for a little red pottage, would not one think that man to have been E&s;au's friend? And ju&s;t thus &s;tands the ca&s;e between God and us. By the death and re&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, we are new-born to an heavenly inheritance among&s;t all them which are &s;anctified; but our own corrupt wills would tempt us to &s;ell this glorious birth-right for the vanities of the world, which, like E&s;au's red pottage, may plea&s;e us for a while, but will &s;oon be taken away from us. God knows this, and therefore rather bids us renounce them for a &s;ea&s;on, than for the &s;hort enjoyment of them lo&s;e the privilege of that glorious birth-right, to which, by knowing the power of the re&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, we are entitled.</P>
<P>O the depth of the riches and excellency of Chri&s;ti|anity! Well might the great St. Paul count all things but dung and dro&s;s for the excellency of the know|ledge of it. Well might he de&s;ire &s;o ardently to know Je&s;us, and the power of his re&s;urrection. For even on this &s;ide eternity it rai&s;es us above the world, and makes us to &s;it in heavenly places in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P>Well might that glorious company of worthies, recorded in the holy &s;criptures, &s;upported with a deep &s;en&s;e of their heavenly calling, de&s;pi&s;e the plea&s;ures and profits of this life, and wander about in &s;heep-&s;kins and goat-&s;kins, in dens and caves

of the earth, being de&s;titute, afflicted, tormented. And O that we were all like-minded! that we felt the power of Chri&s;t's re&s;urrection as they did! How &s;hould we then count all things as dung and dro&s;s for the excellency of the knowledge of Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord! How &s;hould we then recover our primitive dignity, trample the earth under our feet, and with our &s;ouls be continually ga&s;ping after God.</P>
<P>And what hinders but we may be thus minded? Is Je&s;us Chri&s;t, our great High Prie&s;t, altered from what he was? No; he is the &s;ame ye&s;terday, to day, and for ever. And though he is exalted to the right-hand of God, yet he is not a&s;hamed to call us bre|thren. The power of his re&s;urrection is as great now as formerly, and the Holy Spirit, which was a&s;&s;ured to us by his re&s;urrection, as ready and able to quicken us who are dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, as any &s;aint that ever lived. Let us but cry, and that in&s;tantly, to him that is mighty and able to &s;ave; let us, in &s;in|cerity and truth, without &s;ecretly keeping back the lea&s;t part, renounce our&s;elves and the world; then we &s;hall be Chri&s;tians indeed. And though the world may ca&s;t us out and &s;eparate from our company, yet Je&s;us Chri&s;t will walk with, and abide in us. And at the general re&s;urrection of the la&s;t day, when the voice of the archangel and trump of God &s;hall bid the &s;ea and the graves to give up their dead, and all nations &s;hall appear before him, then will he confe&s;s us before his Father and the holy angels, and we &s;hall receive that invitation which he &s;hall then pronounce to all who love and fear him, <Q>Come, ye ble&s;&s;ed children of my Father, inherit the kingdom pre|pared for you from the beginning of the world.</Q></P>

<HEAD>THE INDWELLING OF THE SPIRIT, THE COMMON PRIVILEGE OF ALL BELIEVERS.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>JOHN vii. 37, 38, 39.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>In the la&s;t day, that great day of the fea&s;t, Je&s;us &s;tood, and cried, &s;aying, If any man thir&s;t, let him come unto me and drink. He that believeth on me, as the &s;cripture hath &s;aid, out of his belly &s;hall flow rivers of living water. But this &s;pake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him &s;hould receive.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>NOTHING has rendered the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t of le&s;s effect; nothing has been a greater &s;tum|bling-block and rock of offence to weak minds, than a &s;uppo&s;ition, now current among us, that mo&s;t of what is contained in the go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, was de&s;igned only for our Lord's fir&s;t and immediate followers, and con&s;equently calculated but for one or two hundred years. Accordingly, many now read the life, &s;ufferings, death, and re|&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in the &s;ame manner as Cae&s;ar's Commentaries, or the conque&s;ts of Alex|ander are read: as things rather intended to afford matter for &s;peculation, than to be acted over again in and by us.</P>
<P>As this is true of the doctrines of the go&s;pel in general, &s;o it is of the operation of God's Spirit upon the hearts of believers in particular; for we
<PB N="230" REF="028079_0228_0FD695186C5EBBF0">
no &s;ooner mention the nece&s;&s;ity of our receiving the Holy Gho&s;t in the&s;e la&s;t days, as well as formerly, but we are looked upon by &s;ome, as enthu&s;ia&s;ts and madmen; and by others, repre&s;ented as wilfully deceiving the people, and undermining the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed con&s;titution of the church.</P>
<P>Judge ye then, whether it is not high time for the true mini&s;ters of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who have been made partakers of this heavenly gift, to lift up their voices like a trumpet; and if they would not have tho&s;e &s;ouls peri&s;h, for which the Lord Je&s;us has &s;hed his precious blood, to declare with all boldne&s;s, that the Holy Spirit is the common privilege and portion of all believers in all ages; and that we, as well as the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians, mu&s;t receive the Holy Gho&s;t, before we can be truly called the children of God.</P>
<P>For this rea&s;on, (and al&s;o that I might an&s;wer the de&s;ign of our church in appointing the pre&s;ent fe&s;tival<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whit&s;untide.</NOTE>) I have cho&s;en the words of the text.</P>
<P>They were &s;poken of by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, when he was at the fea&s;t of Tabernacles. Our Lord attended on the temple &s;ervice in general, and the fe&s;tivals of the Jewi&s;h Church in particular. The fe&s;tival at which he was now pre&s;ent, was that of the fea&s;t of Tabernacles, which the Jews ob&s;erved according to God's appointment in commemoration of their liv|ing in tents. At the la&s;t day of this fea&s;t, it was cu&s;tomary for many pious people to fetch water from a certain place, and bring it on their heads, &s;ing|ing this anthem out of I&s;aiah, <Q>And with joy &s;hall they draw water out of the wells of &s;alvation.</Q> Our Lord Je&s;us ob&s;erving this, and it being his con&s;tant practice to &s;piritualize every thing he met with, cries out, <Q>If any man thir&s;t let him come
<PB N="231" REF="028079_0229_0FD69551B9C7EE60">
unto me (rather than unto the well) and drink. He that believeth on me as the &s;crip|ture hath &s;poken,</Q> (where it is &s;aid, God will make water to &s;pring out of a dry rock, and &s;uch like) <Q>out of his belly &s;hall flow rivers of living water.</Q> And that we might know what our Sa|viour meant by this living water, the evangeli&s;t im|mediately adds, <Q>But this &s;pake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him &s;hould receive.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e la&s;t words I &s;hall chiefly in&s;i&s;t on in the en|&s;uing di&s;cour&s;e: And,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I &s;hall briefly &s;hew what is meant by the word Spirit.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That this Spirit is the common privilege of all believers.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> I &s;hall &s;hew the rea&s;on on which this doc|trine is founded. And,</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Conclude with a general exhortation to believe on Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whereby alone we can re|ceive this Spirit.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I am to &s;hew what is meant by the word Spirit.</P>
<P>By the Spirit, is evidently to be under&s;tood the Holy Gho&s;t, the third per&s;on in the ever-ble&s;&s;ed Trinity, con&s;ub&s;tantial and co-eternal with the Father and the Son, proceeding from, yet equal to them both. For, to u&s;e the words of our church in this day's office, that which we believe of the glory of the Father, the &s;ame we believe of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t, without any difference or in|equality.</P>
<P>Thus &s;ays St. John, in his fir&s;t epi&s;tle, chap. v. ver&s;e 7. <Q>There are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Gho&s;t, and the&s;e three are one.</Q> And our Lord, when he gave his apo&s;tles commi&s;&s;ion to go and teach
<PB N="232" REF="028079_0230_0FD6951C5183D748">
all nations, commanded them to baptize in the name of the Holy Gho&s;t, as well as of the Father and the Son. And St. Peter, Acts v. 3. &s;aid to Ananias, <Q>Why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie unto the Holy Gho&s;t? and ver&s;e 4. he &s;ays, Thou ha&s;t not lied unto men, but unto God.</Q> From all which pa&s;&s;ages, it is plain, that the Holy Gho&s;t is truly and properly God, as well as the Father and the Son. This is an un&s;peakable my&s;tery, but a my&s;tery of God's revealing, and, therefore to be a&s;&s;ented to with our whole hearts; &s;eeing God is not a man that he &s;hould lie, nor the &s;on of man that he &s;hould deceive. I proceed,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> To prove, that the Holy Gho&s;t is the common privilege of all believers.</P>
<P>But, here I would not be under&s;tood of &s;o receiv|ing the Holy Gho&s;t, as no enable us to work mira|cles, or &s;hew outward &s;igns and wonders. I allow our adver&s;aries, that to pretend to be in&s;pired in this &s;en&s;e, is being wi&s;e above what is written. Perhaps it cannot be proved, that God ever inter|po&s;ed in this extraordinary manner, but when &s;ome new revelation was to be e&s;tabli&s;hed, as at the fir&s;t &s;ettling of the Mo&s;aic and go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation: and as for my own part, I cannot but &s;u&s;pect the &s;pirit of tho&s;e who in&s;i&s;t upon a repetition of &s;uch miracles at this time. For the world being now become nominally Chri&s;tian, (though God knows, little of its power is left among us) there need not out|ward miracles, but only an inward co-operation of the Holy Spirit with the word, to prove that Je&s;us is the Me&s;&s;iah which was to come into the world.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, if it were po&s;&s;ible for thee, O man, to have faith, &s;o as to be able to remove mountains, or ca&s;t out devils; nay, could'&s;t thou &s;peak with the tongues of men and angels, yea, and bid the &s;un
<PB N="233" REF="028079_0231_0FD6955535B7C138">
&s;tand &s;till in the mid&s;t of heaven; what would all the&s;e gifts of the Spirit avail thee, without being made partaker of his &s;anctifying graces? Saul had the &s;pirit of government for a while, &s;o as to become another man, and yet probably was a ca&s;t-away. And many, who ca&s;t out devils in Chri&s;t's name, at the la&s;t will be di&s;owned by him. If, therefore, thou had&s;t only the gifts, and was de&s;titute of the graces of the Holy Gho&s;t, they would only &s;erve to lead thee with &s;o much the more &s;olemnity to hell.</P>
<P>Here then we join i&s;&s;ue with our adver&s;aries, and will readily grant, that we are not in this &s;en&s;e to be in&s;pired, as were our Lord's fir&s;t apo&s;tles. But unle&s;s men have eyes which &s;ee not, and ears that hear not, how can they read the latter part of the text, and not confe&s;s that the Holy Spirit in another &s;en&s;e, is the common privilege of all believers, even to the end of the world? This &s;pake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him &s;hould re|ceive. Ob&s;erve he does not &s;ay, they that believe on him for one or two ages, but they that believe on him in general, or, at all times, and in all places. So that, unle&s;s we can prove, that St. John was under a delu&s;ion when he wrote the&s;e words, we mu&s;t believe that even we al&s;o, &s;hall receive the Holy Gho&s;t, if we believe on the Lord Je&s;us with our whole hearts.</P>
<P>Again, our Lord, ju&s;t before his bitter pa&s;&s;ion, when he was about to offer up his &s;oul an offering for the &s;ins of the elect world; when his heart was mo&s;t enlarged, and he would undoubtedly demand the mo&s;t excellent gifts for his di&s;ciples, prays, <Q>That they all may be one, as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee; that they al&s;o may be one in us, I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one;</Q> that is, that all his
<PB N="234" REF="028079_0232_0FD6951FD22FD2A0">
true followers might be united to him by his Holy Spirit, by as real, vital, and my&s;tical an union, as there was between Je&s;us Chri&s;t and the Father. I &s;ay all his true followers; for it is evident, from our Lord's own words, that he had us, and all be|lievers in view, when he put up this prayer; <Q>Neither pray I for the&s;e alone, but for them al&s;o which &s;hall believe on me through their word;</Q> &s;o that, unle&s;s we treat our Lord as the high prie&s;ts did, and count him a bla&s;phemer, we mu&s;t confe&s;s, that all who believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, through the word, or mini&s;tration of his &s;ervants, are to be joined to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by being made partakers of the Holy Spirit.</P>
<P>A great noi&s;e hath been made of late, about the word enthu&s;ia&s;t, and it has been ca&s;t upon the preachers of the go&s;pel, as a term of reproach; but every Chri&s;tian, in the proper &s;en&s;e of the word, mu&s;t be an enthu&s;ia&s;t; that is, mu&s;t be in&s;pired of God, or have God, by his Spirit, in him. St Peter tells us, we have many great and precious pro|mi&s;es, that we may be made partakers of the divine nature; our Lord prays, <Q>that we may be one, as the Father and he are one;</Q> and our own church, in conformity to the&s;e texts of &s;cripture, in her ex|cellent communion-office, tell us that tho&s;e who re|ceive the &s;acrament worthily, <Q>Dwell in Chri&s;t, and Chri&s;t in them; that they are one with Chri&s;t, and Chri&s;t with them.</Q> And yet, Chri&s;|tians mu&s;t have their names ca&s;t out as evil, and mini&s;ters in particular, mu&s;t be looked upon a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> deceivers of the people, for affirming, that we mu&s;t be really united to God, by receiving the Holy Gho&s;t. "Be a&s;toni&s;hed, O heavens, at this!"</P>
<P>Indeed, I will not &s;ay, all our letter-learned preachers deny this doctrine in expre&s;s words; but
<PB N="235" REF="028079_0233_0FD6955884209848">
however, they do in effect; for they talk profe&s;&s;edly again&s;t inward feelings, and &s;ay, we may have God's Spirit without feeling it, which is, in reality, to deny the thing it&s;elf. And had I a mind to hin|der the progre&s;s of the go&s;pel, and to e&s;tabli&s;h the kingdom of darkne&s;s, I would go about telling peo|ple, they might have the Spirit of God, and yet not feel it.</P>
<P>But to return: When our Lord was about to a&s;cend to his Father and our Father, to his God and our God, he gave his apo&s;tles this commi&s;&s;ion, <Q>Go and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t.</Q> And accordingly, by authority of this commi&s;&s;ion, we do teach and baptize in this, and every age of the church. And though we tran&s;late the words, "baptizing them in the name;" yet, as the name of God, in the Lord's prayer, and &s;everal other places, &s;ignifies his nature, they might as well be tran&s;lated thus, <Q>baptizing them into the nature of the Father, into the nature of the Son, and into the nature of the Holy Gho&s;t.</Q> Con&s;equently, if we are all to be baptized into the nature of the Holy Gho&s;t, before our bapti&s;m be effectual to &s;al|vation, it is evident, that we all mu&s;t actually re|ceive the Holy Gho&s;t, and ere we can &s;ay, we truly believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. For no one can &s;ay, that Je&s;us is my Lord, but he that has thus received the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>Numbers of other texts might be quoted to make this doctrine, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till more plain; but I am a&s;toni&s;hed, that any who call them&s;elves members; much more, that many, who are preachers in the church of England, &s;hould dare &s;o much as to open their lips again&s;t it. And yet, with grief I &s;peak it, God is my judge, per&s;ons of the e&s;tabli&s;hed
<PB N="236" REF="028079_0234_0FD69521CD5B20E0">
church &s;eem more generally to be ignorant of it than any di&s;&s;enters what&s;oever.</P>
<P>But, my dear brethren, what have you been do|ing? How often have your hearts given your lips the lie? How often have you offered to God the &s;acrifice of fools, and had your prayers turned into &s;in, if you approve of, and u&s;e our church-liturgy, and yet deny the Holy Spirit to be the portion of all believers? In the daily ab&s;olution, the mini&s;ter exhorts the people to pray, that <Q>God would grant them repentance, and his Holy Spirit;</Q> In the Collect for Chri&s;tmas-day, we be&s;eech God, <Q>that he would daily renew us by his Holy Spirit.</Q> In the la&s;t week's Collect, we prayed <Q>that we may evermore rejoice in the comforts of the Ho|ly Gho&s;t;</Q> and in the concluding prayer, which we put up every day, we pray, not only that the grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the love of God, but that "the fellow&s;hip of the Holy Gho&s;t" may be with us all evermore.</P>
<P>But farther, a &s;olemn &s;ea&s;on, to &s;ome, is now ap|proaching: I mean the Ember-days, at the end of which, all that are to be ordained to the office of a deacon, are in the &s;ight of God, and in the pre&s;ence of the congregation, to declare, that they tru&s;t they are inwardly moved by the Holy Gho&s;t, to take up|on them that admini&s;tration; and to tho&s;e who are to be ordained prie&s;ts, the bi&s;hop is to repeat the&s;e &s;olemn words, <Q>Receive thou the Holy Gho&s;t, now committed unto thee by the impo&s;ition of our hands.</Q> And yet, O that I had no rea&s;on to &s;peak it, many that u&s;e our good forms, and many who have witne&s;&s;ed this good confe&s;&s;ion, yet dare to both talk and preach again&s;t the nece&s;&s;ity of re|ceiving the Holy Gho&s;t now; and not only &s;o, but cry out again&s;t tho&s;e, who do in&s;i&s;t upon it, as

<P>But you are the &s;chi&s;matics, you are the bane of the church of England, who are always crying out, "the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord:" and yet &s;tarve the people out of our communion, by feeding them only with the dry hu&s;ks of dead mo|rality, and not bringing out to them the fatted calf; I mean, the doctrines of the operations of the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit of God. But here is the misfortune; many of us are not led by, and therefore no won|der that we cannot talk feelingly of, the Holy Gho&s;t; we &s;ub&s;cribe to our articles, and make them &s;erve for a key to get into church-preferment, and then preach contrary to tho&s;e very articles to which we have &s;ub&s;cribed. Far be it from me, to charge all the clergy with this hateful hypocri&s;y: no, ble&s;&s;ed be God, there are &s;ome left among us who dare maintain the doctrines of the reformation, and preach the truth as it is in Je&s;us: But I &s;peak the truth in Chri&s;t, I lie not; the generality of the clergy are fallen from our articles, and do not &s;peak agreeable to them, or to the form of &s;ound words delivered in the &s;criptures; woe be unto &s;uch blind leaders of the blind! How can you e&s;cape the damnation of hell? It is not all your learning, (fal&s;ely &s;o called) it is not all your preferments can keep you from the ju&s;t judgment of God. Yet a little while, and we &s;hall all appear before the tribunal of Chri&s;t; there, there will I meet you; there Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the great Shepherd and Bi&s;hop of &s;ouls, &s;hall determine who are the fal&s;e prophets, who are the wolves in &s;heep's clothing. Tho&s;e who &s;ay, that we mu&s;t now receive and feel the Holy Gho&s;t, or tho&s;e who exclaim again&s;t it, as the doctrine of devils.</P>

<P>I know indeed, it is now no uncommon thing among&s;t us, to deny the doctrine of original &s;in, as well as the divinity of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; but it is incum|bent on tho&s;e who deny it, fir&s;t to di&s;prove the au|thority of the holy &s;criptures; if thou can&s;t prove, thou unbeliever, that the book, which we call the Bible, does not contain the lively oracles of God; if thou can&s;t &s;hew, that holy men of old did not

write this book, as they were inwardly moved by the Holy Gho&s;t, then will we give up the doctrine of original &s;in; but unle&s;s thou can&s;t do this, we mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t upon it, that we are all conceived and born in &s;in; if for no other, yet for this one rea&s;on, becau&s;e that God, who cannot lie, has told us &s;o.</P>
<P>But what has light to do with darkne&s;s, or polite infidels with the Bible! Alas! as they are &s;trangers to the power, &s;o they are generally as great &s;trangers to the word of God. And therefore, if we will preach to them, we mu&s;t preach to and from the heart: for talking in the language of &s;cripture to them, is but like talking in an unknown tongue. Tell me then, O man, who&s;oever thou art, that de|nie&s;t the doctrine of original &s;in, if thy con&s;cience be not &s;eared as with a hot iron: tell me, if thou do&s;t not find thy&s;elf, by nature, to be a motley mixture of brute and devil? I know the&s;e terms will &s;tir up the whole Phari&s;ee in thy heart! But let not Satan hurry thee hence: &s;top a little, and let us rea&s;on together; do&s;t thou not find, that by nature thou art prone to pride? otherwi&s;e wherefore art thou now offended? Again, do&s;t not thou find in thy&s;elf the &s;eeds of malice, revenge, and all un|charitablene&s;s? And what are the&s;e but the very tem|pers of the devil? Again, do we not all by nature follow, and &s;uffer our&s;elves to be led by our natural appetites, always looking downwards, never looking upwards to that God, in whom we live, move, and have our being? And what is this but the very na|ture of the bea&s;ts that peri&s;h? Out of thy own heart, therefore, will I oblige thee to confe&s;s, what an in&s;pired apo&s;tle has long &s;ince told us, that <Q>the whole world (by nature) lies in the wicked one;</Q> we are no better than tho&s;e whom St. Jude calls brute bea&s;ts; for we have tempers in us all, by na|ture,

that prove to a demon&s;tration, that we are earthly, &s;en&s;ual, devili&s;h.</P>
<P>And this will &s;erve as another argument, to prove the reality of the operations of the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit on the hearts of believers, again&s;t tho&s;e fal&s;e profe&s;&s;ors, who deny there is any &s;uch thing as influences of the Holy Spirit, that may be felt. For if they will grant that the devil worketh, and &s;o as to be felt in the hearts of the children of di&s;obedience, (which they mu&s;t grant, unle&s;s they will give an apo&s;tle the lie) where is the wonder that the good Spirit &s;hould have the &s;ame power over tho&s;e who are truly obedient to the faith of Je&s;us Chri&s;t?</P>
<P>If it be true then, that we are all by nature, &s;ince the fall, a mixture of brute and devil, it is evident, that we all mu&s;t receive the Holy Gho&s;t, ere we can dwell with and enjoy God.</P>
<P>When you read, how the prodigal, in the go&s;pel, was reduced to &s;o low a condition, as to eat hu&s;ks with &s;wine, and how Nebuchadnezzar was turned out to graze with oxen; I am confident, you pity their unhappy &s;tate. And when you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ear how Je&s;us Chri&s;t will &s;ay, at the la&s;t day, to all that are not born again of God. <Q>Depart from me, ye cur&s;ed, into everla&s;ting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels,</Q> do not your hearts &s;hrink within you, with a &s;ecret horror? And if creatures, with only our degree of goodne&s;s, cannot bear even the thoughts of dwelling with bea&s;ts or devils, to who&s;e nature we are &s;o nearly allied, how do we imagine God, who is infinite goodne&s;s, and purity it&s;elf, can dwell with us, while we are partakers of both their natures? We might as well think to reconcile hea|ven and hell.</P>
<P>When Adam had eaten the forbidden fruit, he fled and hid him&s;elf from God; why? becau&s;e
<PB N="241" REF="028079_0239_0FD6955ECD6F8F58">
he was naked; he was alienated from the life of God, the due puni&s;hment of his di&s;obedience. Now we are all by nature naked and void of God, as he was at that time and con&s;equently, until we are changed, renewed, and clothed with a divine na|ture again, we mu&s;t fly from God al&s;o.</P>
<P>Hence then appears the rea&s;onablene&s;s of our being obliged to receive the Spirit of God. It is founded on the doctrine of original &s;in; and there|fore, you will always find, that tho&s;e who talk again&s;t feeling the operations of the Holy Gho&s;t, very rarely, or &s;lightly at lea&s;t, mention our fall in Adam; no, they refer St. Paul's account of the depravity of unbelievers, only to tho&s;e of old time. Whereas it it obvious, on the contrary, that we are all equally included under the guilt and con&s;equences of our fir&s;t parents &s;in, even as others; and to u&s;e the language of our own church-article, <Q>bring into the world with us, a corruption, which ren|ders us liable to God's wrath, and eternal dam|nation.</Q></P>
<P>Should I preach to you any other doctrine, I &s;hould wrong my own &s;oul; I &s;hould be found a fal&s;e witne&s;s towards God and you; and he that preaches any other doctrine, how&s;oever dignified and di&s;|tingui&s;hed, &s;hall bear his puni&s;hment, who&s;oever he be.</P>
<P>From this plain rea&s;on then appears the nece&s;&s;ity, why we, as well as the fir&s;t apo&s;tles, in this &s;en&s;e, mu&s;t receive the Spirit of God.</P>
<P>For the great work of &s;anctification, or making us holy, is particularly referred to the Holy Gho&s;t; therefore, our Lord &s;ays, <Q>Unle&s;s a man be born of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</Q></P>
<P>Je&s;us Chri&s;t came down to &s;ave us, not only from

<P>And now, my brethren, what &s;hall I &s;ay more? Tell me, are not many of your offended at what has been &s;aid already? Do not &s;ome of you think, tho' I mean well, yet I have carried the point a little too far? Are not others ready to cry out, if this be true, "who then can be &s;aved?" Is not this driving people into de&s;pair?</P>
<P>Yes, I ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;s it is? but into what de&s;pair? a de&s;pair of mercy through Chri&s;t? No, God forbid; but a de&s;pair of living with God with|out receiving the Holy Gho&s;t. And I would to God, that not only all you that hear me this day, but that the whole world was filled with this de&s;pair. Be|lieve me, I have been doing no more that you allow your bodily phy&s;icians to do every day: if you have a wound, and are in earne&s;t about a cure, you bid the &s;urgeon probe it to the very bottom; and &s;hall not the phy&s;ician of your &s;ouls be allowed the &s;ame freedom? What have I been doing but &s;earching your natural wounds, that I might convince you of your danger, and put you upon applying to Je&s;us Chri&s;t for a remedy?

Indeed, the poor generally receive the go&s;pel, and God has cho&s;en the poor in this world, rich in faith.

<BIBL>MATTHEW xxv. 46.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>The&s;e &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting Puni&s;hment.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE excellency of the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation is greatly evidenced by tho&s;e &s;anctions of re|wards and puni&s;hments which it offers to the choice of all its hearers, in order to engage them to be obedient to its precepts. For it promi&s;es no le&s;s than eternal happine&s;s to the good, and denounces no &s;lighter a puni&s;hment that everla&s;ting mi&s;ery again&s;t the wicked: on the one hand, <Q>It is a favour of life unto life; on the other, a favour of death unto death.</Q> And though one would imagine the bare mentioning of the former would be &s;ufficient to draw men to their duty, yet mini&s;ters in all ages, have found it nece&s;&s;ary, frequently to remind their people of the latter, and to &s;et before them the terrors of the Lord, as &s;o many powerful di&s;&s;ua&s;ives from &s;in.</P>
<P>But whence is it that men are &s;o di&s;ingenuous? The rea&s;on &s;eems to be this: the promi&s;e of eternal happine&s;s is &s;o agreeable to the inclinations and wi&s;hes of mankind, that all who call them&s;elves? Chri&s;tians, univer&s;ally and willingly &s;ub&s;cribe to the belief of it: but then there is &s;omething &s;o
<PB N="248" REF="028079_0246_0FD6952A615C40B0">
&s;hocking in the con&s;ideration of eternal torments, and &s;eemingly &s;uch an infinite di&s;proportion between an endle&s;s duration of pain, and a &s;hort life &s;pent in plea&s;ure, that men (&s;ome at lea&s;t of them) can &s;carcely be brought to confe&s;s it as an article of their faith, that an eternity of mi&s;ery awaits the wicked in a future &s;tate.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore, at this time, beg leave to in&s;i&s;t on the proof of this part of one of the articles of our creed; and endeavour to make good what our ble&s;|&s;ed Lord has here threatened in the words of the text, <Q>The&s;e (that is the wicked) &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment.</Q></P>
<P>Accordingly, without con&s;idering the words as they &s;tand in relation to the context, I &s;hall re&s;olve all I have to &s;ay, into this one general propo&s;ition, <Q>That the torments re&s;erved for the wicked here|after, are eternal.</Q></P>
<P>But before I proceed to make good this, I mu&s;t inform you that I take it for granted,</P>
<P>All pre&s;ent do &s;tedfa&s;tly believe, They have &s;omething within them, which we call a &s;oul, and which is capable of &s;urviving the di&s;&s;olution of the body, and of being mi&s;erable or happy to all eter|nity.</P>
<P>I take it for granted farther, That you believe a divine revelation; that tho&s;e books emphatically called the Scriptures, were written by the in&s;pira|tion of God, and that the things therein contained, are founded upon eternal truth.</P>
<P>I take it for granted, That you believe, that the Son of God came down to die for &s;inners; and that there is but one Mediator between God and man, even the Man Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P>The&s;e things being granted, and they were ne|ce&s;&s;ary to be premi&s;ed, proceed we now to make

good the one general propo&s;ition a&s;&s;erted in the text, That the torments re&s;erved for the wicked hereafter are eternal. <Q>The&s;e &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment.</Q> The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t</HI> argument I &s;hall advance to prove that the torments re&s;erved for the wicked hereafter are eter|nal, (for I have taken it for granted, that you be|lieve tho&s;e books, emphatically called the Scrip|tures, were written by the in&s;piration of God, and that the things contained therein are founded upon eternal truth) is, that the word of God him&s;elf a&s;&s;ures us, in line upon line, that it will be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>To quote all the texts that might be produced in proof of this, would be endle&s;s. Let it &s;uffice to in&s;tance only a few. In the old Te&s;tament, in the book of Daniel, chap. xii. ver&s;e 2. we are told, that <Q>&s;ome &s;hall awake to everla&s;ting life, and others to everla&s;ting contempt.</Q> In the book of I&s;aiah, it is &s;aid, that <Q>the worm of tho&s;e who have tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ed God's law, and die impenitently, &s;hall not die, nor their fire be quenched.</Q> And, in another place, the holy prophet, &s;truck, no doubt, with a&s;toni&s;hment and horror at the pro&s;pect of the continuance of the torments of the damned, breaks out into this moving expo&s;tulation, <Q>Who can dwell with everla&s;ting burning?</Q></P>
<P>The New Te&s;tament is &s;till fuller as to this point, it being a revelation which brought this and &s;uch like particulars <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a clear light. The apo&s;tle Jude tells us of the profane de&s;pi&s;ers of dignities in his days, that, <Q>for them was re&s;erved the blackne&s;s of darkne&s;s for ever.</Q> And in the Revelations it is written, that the &s;moke of the torments of the wicked a&s;cendeth for ever and ever. And if we believe the witne&s;s of men in&s;pired, the witne&s;s of the Son of God, who had the Spirit given him,

<P>I know it ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> been objected by &s;ome who have denied the eternity of hell-torment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, That the words, everla&s;ting, and ever and ever, are often u&s;ed in the Holy Scriptures, (e&s;pecially in the Old Te&s;|tament) when they &s;ignify not an endle&s;s duration; but a limited term of time.</P>
<P>And this we readily grant: But then we reply, That when the words are u&s;ed with this limitation, they either manife&s;tly appear to be u&s;ed &s;o from the context; or are put in oppo&s;ition to occa&s;ional types, which God gave his people on &s;ome &s;pecial occa&s;ions, as when it is &s;aid, <Q>It &s;hall be a per|petual or everla&s;ting &s;tatute, or, a &s;tatute for ever;</Q> that is, a &s;tanding type, and not merely tran&s;ient or occa&s;ional, as was the pillar of cloud, the manna, and &s;uch like. Or, la&s;tly, they have a relation to that covenant God made with his &s;pi|ritual I&s;rael; which if under&s;tood in a &s;piritual &s;en&s;e, will be everla&s;ting, though the ceremonial di&s;pen&s;ation be aboli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, it ought to be ob&s;erved, that &s;ome of the pa&s;&s;ages ju&s;t now referred to, have neither of

the&s;e words &s;o much as mentioned in them and can|not po&s;&s;ibly be interpreted, &s;o as to denote only a limited term of years.</P>
<P>But let that be as it will, it is evident even to a demon&s;tration, that the words of the text will not admit of &s;uch a re&s;trained &s;ignification, as appears from their being directly oppo&s;ed to the words im|mediately following, <Q>That the righteous &s;hall go into life eternal.</Q> From which words, all are ready to grant, that the life promi&s;ed to the righ|teous will be eternal. And why the puni&s;hment threatened to the wicked &s;hould not be under&s;tood to be eternal likewi&s;e, when the very &s;ame words in the original, is u&s;ed to expre&s;s the duration of each, no &s;hadow of rea&s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> can be given.</P>
<P>But, <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> There <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">anno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">, why God &s;hould reward his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ints with ever|la&s;ting happine&s;s which will not equally prove that he ought to puni&s;h &s;inners with eternal mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>For, &s;ince we know nothing (at lea&s;t for a cer|tainty) how he will deal with either, but by a di|vine revelation; and &s;ince, as was proved by the foregoing argument, he hath as po&s;itively threaten|ed eternally to puni&s;h the wicked, as to reward the good; it follows, that his truth will be as much impeached and called in que&s;tion, did he not inflict his puni&s;hments, as it would be, if he did not con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> his rewards.</P>
<P>To this al&s;o it has been objected, That though God is obliged by promi&s;e to give his rewards, yet his veracity could not be called in que&s;tion, &s;up|po&s;ing, he &s;hould not execute his threatenings, as he actually did not in the ca&s;e of Nineveh; which God expre&s;sly declared by his prophet Jonah, "&s;hould be de&s;troyed in forty days:" Notwith&s;tand|ing the &s;equel of the &s;tory informs us, that Nine|veh was &s;pared.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="028079_0250_0FD6956D0A2ECBD8">
But in an&s;wer to this objection, we affirm, That God's threatenings, as well as promi&s;es, are with|out repentance; and for this rea&s;on, becau&s;e they are both founded on the eternal laws of right rea|&s;on. Accordingly we always find, that where the conditions were not performed, on the non-perform|ance of which the threatenings were denounced; God always executed the puni&s;hment threaten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">. The driving Adam out of Eden, the de&s;truction of the old world by a deluge of water, and the over|throw of Sodom and Gomorrah, are, and will be always &s;o many &s;tanding monuments of God's exe|cuting his threatenings when denounced, though a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> our weak apprehen&s;ions, the puni&s;hment may &s;ee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> far to exceed the crime.</P>
<P>It is true, God did &s;pare Nineveh, and that be|cau&s;e the inhabitants did actually repent, and there|fore performed the conditions upon which it was &s;uppo&s;ed, by the prophet's being &s;ent to warn them, the threatened puni&s;hment &s;hould be with-held.</P>
<P>And &s;o in re&s;pect to go&s;pel-threatenings. If men will &s;o far con&s;ult their own welfare as to comply with the go&s;pel, God certainly will not puni&s;h them, but on the contrary, confer upon them his rewards. But to affirm that he will not puni&s;h, and that eter|nally too, impenitent, ob&s;tinate &s;inners, according as he hath threatened; what is it, in effect, but to make God like a man, that he &s;hould lie, or the &s;on of man, that he &s;hould repent?</P>
<P>But the ab&s;urdity of &s;uch an opinion will appear &s;till more evident from</P>
<P>The <HI>third</HI> argument I &s;hall offer to prove, that the torments re&s;erved for the wicked hereafter are eternal, from the nature of the Chri&s;tian covenant.</P>
<P>And here I mu&s;t again ob&s;erve, that it was taken for granted at the beginning of this di&s;cour&s;e, that
<PB N="253" REF="028079_0251_0FD695AF08365B20">
you believe the Son of God came down to &s;ave &s;in|ners; and that there is but one Mediator between God and man, even the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P>And here I take it for granted farther. (unle&s;s you believe the ab&s;urd and unwarrantable doctrine of purgatory) that you are fully per&s;uaded, this life is the only time allotted by Almighty God for working out our &s;alvation, and that after a few years are pa&s;&s;ed over, there will remain no more &s;acrifice for &s;in.</P>
<P>And if this be granted (and who dares deny it?) it follows, that if a wicked man dieth in his wick|edne&s;s, and under the wrath of God, he mu&s;t con|tinue in that &s;tate to all eternity. For, &s;ince there is no po&s;&s;ibility of his being delivered out of &s;uch a condition, but by and through Chri&s;t; and &s;ince, at the hour of death, the time of Chri&s;t's mediation and interce&s;&s;ion for him is irrecoverably gone; the &s;ame rea&s;on that may be given, why God &s;hould puni&s;h a &s;inner that dieth under the guilt of his &s;ins for a &s;ingle day, will equally hold good, why he &s;hould continue to puni&s;h him for a year, an age, nay to all eternity.</P>
<P>But I ha&s;ten to the <HI>fourth</HI> and la&s;t argument, to prove, That the torments re&s;erved for the wicked hereafter are eternal, becau&s;e the devil's puni&s;h|ment is to be &s;o.</P>
<P>That there is &s;uch a being whom we call the devil; that he was once an angel of light, but for his pride and rebellion again&s;t God, was ca&s;t down from heaven, and is now permitted, with the re&s;t of the &s;piritual wickedne&s;&s;es, to walk to and fro, &s;eeking whom they may devour; that there is a place of torment re&s;erved for them, or to u&s;e the apo&s;tle's words, <Q>That they are re&s;erved in ever|la&s;ting chains under darkne&s;s unto the judgment

of the great day;</Q> are truths all here pre&s;ent were &s;uppo&s;ed to be convinced of, at the beginning of this di&s;cour&s;e, you believing the Holy Scriptures to be written by the in&s;piration of God, wherein the&s;e truths are delivered.</P>
<P>But then, if we allow all this, and thin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> it no inju&s;tice in God to puni&s;h tho&s;e once glorious &s;pirits for their rebellion; how can we think it unju&s;t in him to puni&s;h wicked men for their impertinency to all eternity.</P>
<P>You will &s;ay, perhaps, that they have &s;inned again&s;t greater light, and therefore de&s;erve a great|er puni&s;hment. And &s;o we grant that the puni&s;h|ment of the fallen angels may be greater as to de|gree, than that of wicked men? but then we affirm, it will be equal as to the eternal duration of it: for in that day, as the lively oracles of God informs us, &s;hall the Son of man &s;ay to them on his left hand, <Q>Depart from me, ye cur&s;ed, into ever|la&s;ting fire prepared for the devil and his angels.</Q> Where we find that impenitent &s;inners are to be ca&s;t into the &s;ame everla&s;ting fire with the devil and his angels; and that too very ju&s;tly. For tho' they may have &s;inned again&s;t greater light, yet Chri&s;tians &s;in again&s;t greater mercy; &s;ince Chri&s;t took not hold of, did not die for, the fallen angels, but for men and for our &s;alvation. So that if God &s;pared not tho&s;e excellent beings, a&s;&s;ure thy&s;elf, O ob&s;tinate &s;inner, whoever thou art, he will by no means &s;pare thee.</P>
<P>From what then has been &s;aid it plainly appears, that verily the torments re&s;erved for the wicked hereafter, are eternal. And if &s;o, brethren, how ought we to fly to Je&s;us Chri&s;t for refuge; how holy ought we to be in all manner of conver&s;ation and godline&s;s. That we may be accounted worthy to e&s;cape this wrath to come!</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="028079_0253_0FD695B0F8AF3718">
But before I proceed to a practical exhortation, permit me to draw an inference o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> two from what has been &s;aid.</P>
<P>And <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> if the torments re&s;erved for the wicked hereafter are eternal, what &s;hall we &s;ay to tho&s;e, who make an open profe&s;&s;ion in their creed to be|lieve a life everla&s;ting, a life of mi&s;ery <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> happine&s;s, and yet dare to live in the actual com|mi&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e &s;ins which will unavoidably, with|out repentance, bring them into that place of tor|ment? Thou believe&s;t that the puni&s;hments of the impenitently wicked in another life, are eternal: thou doe&s;t well, the devils al&s;o believe and tremble. But know, O vain man, unle&s;s this belief doth in|fluence thy practice, and makes thee bid adieu to thy &s;ins, every time thou repeate&s;t thy creed, thou do&s;t in effect &s;ay, I believe I &s;hall be undone for ever.</P>
<P>But, <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> If the torments re&s;erved for the wicked hereafter are eternal, then let this &s;erve as a caution to &s;uch per&s;ons, (and it is to be feared there are &s;ome &s;uch) who go about to di&s;&s;uade others from the belief of &s;uch an important truth; there being no &s;urer way, in all probability, to encou|rage and promote infidelity and prophanene&s;s, than the broaching or maintaining &s;o unwarrantable a doctrine. For if the po&s;itive threats of God con|cerning the eternity of hell-torments, are already found in&s;ufficient to deter men from &s;in, a higher pitch of wickedne&s;s may we imagine they will quickly arrive at, when they are taught to entertain any hopes of a future recovery out of them; or, what is &s;till wor&s;e, that their &s;ouls are hereafter to be annihilated, and become like the bea&s;ts that peri&s;h? But wo unto &s;uch blind leaders of the blind. No wonder if they both fall into the ditch. And let &s;uch corrupters of God's word know, that I

te&s;tify unto every man that heareth me this day, <Q>That if any one &s;hall add unto, or take away from the words that are written in the book of God, God &s;hall take his part out of the book of life, and &s;hall add unto him all the plagues that are in that book.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly</HI> and <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> If the torments re&s;erved for the wicked hereafter are eternal, then this may &s;erve as a reproof for tho&s;e who quarrel with God, and &s;ay it is incon&s;i&s;tent with his ju&s;tice, to puni&s;h a per&s;on to all eternity, only for enjoying the plea|&s;ures of &s;in for a &s;ea&s;on. But &s;uch per&s;ons mu&s;t be told, that it is not their thinking or calling God unju&s;t, will make him &s;o, no more than a condemned pri&s;oner's &s;aying the law or judge is unju&s;t, will render either duly chargeable with &s;uch an impu|tation.

And if &s;inners will not own his ju&s;tice in his threatenings here, they will be compelled ere long to own and feel them, when tormented by him hereafter.</P>
<P>But to come to a more practical application of what has been delivered.</P>
<P>You have heard, brethren, the eternity of hell-torments plainly proved, from the expre&s;s declara|tions of Holy Scriptures, and con&s;equences natu|rally

drawn from them. And now there &s;eems to need no great art of rhetoric to per&s;uade any under|&s;tanding per&s;on to avoid and abhor tho&s;e &s;ins, which, without repentance will certainly plunge him into this eternal gulph. The di&s;proportion between the plea&s;ure and the pain (if there be any plea&s;ure in &s;in) is &s;o infinitely great that &s;uppo&s;ing it was only po&s;|&s;ible, though not certain, that the wicked would be everla&s;tingly puni&s;hed, no one that has the rea|&s;on of a man, for the enjoying a little momentary plea&s;ure, would, one might imagine, run the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of enduring eternal pain. But &s;ince the tor|ments of the damned are not only po&s;&s;ible, but certain, (&s;ince God him&s;elf, who cannot lie, has told us &s;o) for men, notwith&s;tanding, to per&s;i&s;t in their di&s;obedience, and then flatter them&s;elves, that God will not make good his threatenings, is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> egregious in&s;tance of folly and pre&s;umption.</P>
<P>Dives him&s;elf &s;uppo&s;ed, that if one ro&s;e from the dead, his brethren would amend their lives; but Chri&s;tians, it &s;eems, will not repent, though the Son of God died and ro&s;e again, and told them what they mu&s;t expect, if they continue ob&s;tinate in evil-doing.</P>
<P>Would we now and then draw off our thoughts from &s;en&s;ible objects, and by faith meditate a while on the mi&s;eries of the damned, I doubt not but we &s;hould, as it were, hear many an unhappy &s;oul venting his fruitle&s;s &s;orrows, in &s;ome &s;uch piteous moans as the&s;e.</P>

O that I had never ridiculed &s;erious godline&s;s; and out of a fal&s;e politene&s;s, condemned the truly pious as too &s;evere, enthu&s;ia&s;tic, or &s;uper&s;titious! For I then had been happy indeed, happy beyond expre&s;&s;ion, happy to all eternity, yonder in tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed regions where they &s;it, clothed with un&s;peakable glory, and chant|ing forth their &s;eraphic hallelujahs to the Lamb that &s;itteth upon the throne for-ever. But, alas! the&s;e reflections come too late: the&s;e wi&s;hes now are vain and fruitle&s;s; I have not &s;uffered, and therefore mu&s;t not reign with them. I have in effect denied the Lord that bought me, and therefore ju&s;tly am I now denied by him. But mu&s;t I live for ever tor|mented in the&s;e flames?

<P>But I can no more.

<P>And now, are not &s;ome of you ready to cry out, "The&s;e are hard &s;ayings, who can bear them?"</P>

<P>A re&s;olution this, worthy of Jo&s;hua, and no le&s;s becoming, no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary for every true &s;on of Jo&s;hua, that is intru&s;ted with the care and govern|ment of a family in our day: and, if it was ever &s;ea&s;onable for mini&s;ters to preach up, or people to put in practice Family Religion, it was never more &s;o than in the pre&s;ent age; &s;ince it is greatly to be feared, that out of tho&s;e many hou&s;eholds that call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, there are but few that &s;erve God in their re&s;pective families as they ought.</P>
<P>It is true indeed, vi&s;it our churches and you may perhaps &s;ee &s;omething of the form of godline&s;s &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting among us; but even that is &s;carcely to be met with in private hou&s;es. So that were the ble&s;|&s;ed angels to come, as in the patriarchal age, and ob&s;erve our &s;piritual oeconomy at home, would they not be tempted to &s;ay, as Abraham to Abimelech, "Surely the fear of God is not in this place?"

<P>How &s;uch a general neglect of Family Religion fir&s;t began to over&s;pread the Chri&s;tian world, is difficult to determine. As for the primitive Chri&s;|tians, I am po&s;itive it was not &s;o with them: No, they had not &s;o learned Chri&s;t, as fal&s;ely to imagine religion was to be confined &s;olely to their a&s;&s;emblies

And, I believe we mu&s;t for ever de&s;pair of &s;eeing a primitive &s;pirit of piety revived in the world, till we are &s;o happy as to &s;ee a revival of primitive Family Religion; and per&s;ons unanimou&s;ly re&s;olving with good old Jo&s;hua, in the words of the text, <Q>As for me and my hou&s;e, we will &s;erve the Lord.</Q></P>
<P>From which words, I &s;hall beg leave to in&s;i&s;t on the&s;e three things.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That it is the duty of every governor of a family to take care, that not only he him&s;elf, but al&s;o that tho&s;e committed to his charge, &s;erve the Lord.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. <HI>Secondly,</HI> I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew after what manner a governor and his hou&s;ehold ought to &s;erve the Lord. And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> I &s;hall offer &s;ome motives, in order to excite all governors, with their re&s;pective hou&s;e|holds, to &s;erve the Lord in the manner that &s;hall be recommended.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>And <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I am to &s;hew that it is the duty of every governor of a family to take care, that not only he him&s;elf, but al&s;o that tho&s;e committed to his charge, &s;hould &s;erve the Lord.</P>
<P>And this will appear, if we con&s;ider that every governor of a family ought to look upon him&s;elf as obliged to act in three capacities: as a prophet, to in&s;truct; as a prie&s;t, to pray for and with; as a king, to govern, direct, and provide for them. It is true indeed, the latter of the&s;e, their kingly office, they are not &s;o frequently deficient in, (nay in this they are generally too &s;olicitous;) but as for
<PB N="264" REF="028079_0262_0FD6957CC9F6E740">
the two former, their prie&s;tly and prophetic offices, like Gallio, they care for no &s;uch things. But how|ever indifferent &s;ome governors may be about it, they may be a&s;&s;ured, that God will require a due di&s;charge of the&s;e offices at their hands. For if, as the apo&s;tle argues, <Q>he that does not provide for his own hou&s;e, in temporal things, has denied the faith and is wor&s;e than an infidel;</Q> to what greater degree of apo&s;tacy mu&s;t he have arrived, who takes no thought to provide for the &s;piritual welfare of his family.</P>
<P>But farther, per&s;ons are generally very liberal of their invectives again&s;t the clergy, and think they ju&s;tly blame the conduct of that mini&s;ter who does not take heed to and watch over the flock, of which the Holy Gho&s;t has made him over&s;eer: but may not every governor of a family, be in a lower degree liable to the &s;ame cen&s;ure, who takes no thought for tho&s;e &s;ouls who are committed to his charge? For every hou&s;e is as it were a little pa|ri&s;h, every governor (as was before ob&s;erved) a prie&s;t, every family a flock: And if any of them peri&s;h through the governor's neglect, their blood will God require at his hands.</P>
<P>Were a mini&s;ter to di&s;regard teaching his peo|ple publicly, and from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, and to ex|cu&s;e him&s;elf by &s;aying that he had enough to do to work out his own &s;alvation with fear and trembling, without concerning him&s;elf with that of others; would you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> be apt to think &s;uch a mini&s;ter, to be like the unju&s;t judge, <Q>One that neither feared God nor regarded man?</Q> And yet, odious as &s;uch a character would be, it is no wor&s;e than that governor of a family de&s;erves, who thinks him&s;elf obliged only to &s;ave his own &s;oul, without paying any regard to the &s;ouls of his hou&s;ehold. For (as
<PB N="265" REF="028079_0263_0FD695BE111A4FA8">
was above hinted) every hou&s;e is as it were a pa|ri&s;h, and every ma&s;ter is concerned to &s;ecure, as much as in him lies, the &s;piritual pro&s;perity of every one under his roof, as any mini&s;ter whatever is obliged to look to the &s;piritual welfare of every in|dividual per&s;on under his charge.</P>
<P>What precedents men who neglect their duty in this particular, can plead for &s;uch omi&s;&s;ion, I cannot tell. Doubtle&s;s not the example of holy Job, who was &s;o far from imagining that he had no concern, as governor of a family, with any one's &s;oul but his own, that the &s;cripture acquaints us, <Q>When the days of his children's fea&s;ting were gone about, that Job &s;ent and &s;anctified them, and offered burnt offerings, according to the number of them all; for Job &s;aid, it may be that my &s;ons have &s;inned and cur&s;ed God, in their hearts:</Q> Thus did Job continually." Nor can they plead the practice of good old Jo&s;hua, whom, in the text, we find as much concerned for his hou&s;ehold's welfare, as his own. Nor la&s;tly, that of Cornelius, who feared God, not only him&s;elf, but with all his hou&s;e: And were Chri&s;tians but of the &s;ame &s;pirit of Job, Jo&s;hua, and the Gentile centurion, they would act as Job, Jo&s;hua, and Cornelius did.</P>
<P>But alas! if this be the ca&s;e, and all governors of families ought not only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o &s;erve the Lord them|&s;elves, but likewi&s;e to &s;ee that their re&s;pective hou&s;e|holds do &s;o too; what will then become of tho&s;e who not only neglect &s;erving God them&s;elves, but al&s;o make it their bu&s;ine&s;s to ridicule and &s;coff at any of their hou&s;e that do? Who are not content with <Q>not entering into the kingdom of heaven them|&s;elves; but tho&s;e al&s;o that are willing to enter in, they hinder.</Q> Surely &s;uch men are factors for the devil indeed. Surely their damnation &s;lumber|eth
<PB N="266" REF="028079_0264_0FD6957F15ED5F70">
not: For although God, in his good providence may &s;uffer &s;uch &s;tumbling-blocks to be put in his children's way, and &s;uffer their greate&s;t enemies to be tho&s;e of their own hou&s;eholds, for a trial of their &s;incerity, and improvemement of their faith; yet we cannot but pronounce a woe again&s;t tho&s;e ma&s;ters "by whom &s;uch offences came." For if tho&s;e that only take care of their own &s;ouls, can &s;carcely be &s;aved, where will &s;uch mon&s;trous pro|fane and wicked governors appear?</P>
<P>But hoping there are but few of this unhappy &s;tamp, proceed we now to the</P>
<P><HI>Second</HI> thing propo&s;ed; To &s;hew after what man|ner a governor and his hou&s;ehold ought to &s;erve the Lord.</P>
<P N="1">1. And the fir&s;t thing I &s;hall mention, is, reading the word of God. This is a duty incumbent on every private per&s;on. <Q>Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life,</Q> is a pre|cept given by our ble&s;&s;ed Lord indifferently to all: but much more &s;o, ought every governor of a family to think it in a peculiar manner &s;poken to my&s;elf, becau&s;e (as hath been already proved) he ought to look upon him&s;elf as a prophet, and therefore, agreeably to &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> character, bound to in&s;truct tho&s;e under his charge in the knowledge of the word of God.</P>
<P>This we find was the order God gave to his pe|culiar people I&s;rael: for thus &s;peaks his repre&s;enta|tive Mo&s;es, Deut. vi. 6, 7. "The&s;e words," that is, the &s;cripture words, <Q>which I command thee this day, &s;hall be in thy heart, and thou &s;halt teach them diligently unto thy children,</Q> that is, as it is generally explained, &s;ervants as well as children, <Q>and &s;halt talk of them when thou &s;itte&s;t in thy hou&s;e.</Q> From whence we may infer, that
<PB N="267" REF="028079_0265_0FD695C28EE8F888">
the only rea&s;on, why &s;o many neglect to read the words of Scripture diligently to their children is, becau&s;e the words of Scripture are not in their hearts: for if they were, out of the abundance of the heart their mouth would &s;peak.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, &s;ervants as well as children, are, for the generality, very ignorant, and m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">re novices in the laws of God: And how &s;hall they know, unle&s;s &s;ome one teach them? and what more proper to teach them by, than the lively oracles of God, <Q>which are able to make them wi&s;e unto &s;alvation?</Q> And who more proper to in&s;truct them by the&s;e lively oracles, than parents and ma&s;ters, who (as hath been more than once ob&s;erved) are as much con|cerned to feed them with &s;piritual, as with bodily bread, day by day.</P>
<P>But if the&s;e things be &s;o, what a mi&s;erable con|dition are tho&s;e unhappy governors in, who are &s;o far from feeding tho&s;e committed to their care with the &s;incere milk of the word, to the intent they may grow thereby, that they neither &s;earch the &s;criptures them&s;elves, nor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">re careful to explain them to others? Such families mu&s;t be in a happy way indeed to do their ma&s;ter's will, who take &s;uch prodigious pains to know it! Would not one imagine that they had turned converts to the church of Rome; that they thought ignorance to be the mother of de|votion; and that tho&s;e were to be condemned as heretics who read their bibles? And yet how few families are there among&s;t us, who do not act after this un&s;eemly manner! <Q>But &s;hall I prai&s;e them in this? I prai&s;e them not: Brethren, this thing ought not &s;o to be.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. Pa&s;s we on now to the &s;econd means whereby every governor and his hou&s;ehold ought to &s;erve the Lord, Family-prayer.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="028079_0266_0FD69583E4636A18">
This is a duty, though as much neglected, yet as ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary as the former. Reading is a good preparative for prayer, as prayer is an ex|cellent means to render reading effectual. And the rea&s;on why every governor of a family &s;hould join both the&s;e exerci&s;es together, is plain, becau&s;e a governor of a family cannot perform his prie&s;tly office (which we before ob&s;erved he is in &s;ome de|gree inve&s;ted with) without performing this duty of family-prayer.</P>
<P>We find it therefore remarked, when mention is made of Cain and Abel's offering &s;acrifices, that they brought them. But to whom did they bring them? Why, in all probability to their father A|dam, who, as prie&s;t of the family was to offer &s;a|crifice in their names. And &s;o likewi&s;e ought every &s;piritual &s;on of the &s;econd Adam, who is intru&s;ted with the care of an hou&s;ehold to offer up the &s;piri|tual &s;acrifices of &s;upplications and thank&s;givings, acceptable to God through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in the pre|&s;ence and name of all who wait upon, or eat me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> at his table.</P>
<P>Thus we read our ble&s;&s;ed Lord behaved when he tabernacled among&s;t us: For it is &s;aid often, that he prayed with his twelve di&s;ciples, which was then his little family. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> him&s;elf has promi&s;ed a particular ble&s;&s;ing to joint &s;upplications: Where|&s;oever two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the mid&s;t of them. And again, If two or three are agreed touching any thing they &s;hall a&s;k, it &s;hall be given them. Add to this, that we are commanded by the apo&s;tle to pray always, with all manner of &s;upplication, which doubtle&s;s includes family-prayer. And holy Jo&s;hua, when he &s;et up the good re&s;olution in the text, that he and his hou&s;ehold would &s;erve the Lord, certainly re&s;olv|ed
<PB N="269" REF="028079_0267_0FD695C292EA8398">
to pray with his family, which is one of the be&s;t te&s;timonies they could give of their &s;erving him.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, there are no families but what have &s;ome common ble&s;&s;ings, of which they have been all par|takers, to give thanks for; &s;ome common cro&s;&s;es and afflictions, which they are to pray again&s;t; &s;ome common &s;ins, which they are all to lament and bewail: But how this can be done, without joining together in one common act of humiliation, &s;uppli|cation, and thank&s;giving, is difficult to devi&s;e.</P>
<P>From all which con&s;iderations put together, it is evident, that family-prayer is a great and nece&s;&s;ary duty; and con&s;equently, tho&s;e governors that neg|lect it, are certainly without excu&s;e. And it is much to be feared, if they live without family-prayer, they live without God in the world.</P>
<P>And yet, &s;uch an hateful character as this is, it is to be feared, that was God to &s;end out an angel to de&s;troy us, as he did once to de&s;troy the Egyptian fir&s;t-born, and withal give him a commi&s;&s;ion, as then, to &s;pare no hou&s;es but where they &s;aw the blood on the lintel, &s;prinkled on the door-po&s;t, &s;o now, to let no families e&s;cape, but tho&s;e that called upon him in morning and evening prayer: few would remain unhurt by his avenging &s;word. Shall I term &s;uch families Chri&s;tians or heathens: doubt|le&s;s they de&s;erve not the name of Chri&s;tians; and heathens will &s;urely ri&s;e up in judgment again&s;t &s;uch prophane families of this generation: for they had always their hou&s;ehold gods, whom they wor&s;hip|ped, and who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance they frequently invoked. And a pretty pa&s;s tho&s;e families &s;urely are arrived at, who mu&s;t be &s;ent to &s;chool to Pagans. But will not the Lord be avenged on &s;uch prophane hou&s;e|holds as the&s;e? Will he not pour out his fury upon tho&s;e that call not upon his name?</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="270" REF="028079_0268_0FD69586132D0EC0">
3. But it is time for me to ha&s;ten to the third and la&s;t means I &s;hall recommend, whereby every go|vernor ought with his hou&s;ehold to &s;erve the Lord, catechi&s;ing and in&s;tructing their children and &s;er|vants, and bringing them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</P>
<P>That this, as well as the two former, is a duty incumbent on every governor of an hou&s;e, appears from that famous encomium or commendation God gives of Abraham: <Q>I know that he will command his children and his hou&s;ehold after him, to keep the way of the Lord, to do ju&s;tice and judgment.</Q> And indeed &s;carce any thing is more frequently pre&s;&s;ed upon us in holy writ, than this duty of ca|techi&s;ing. Thus, &s;ays God in a pa&s;&s;age before cited, <Q>Thou &s;halt teach the&s;e words diligently to thy children.</Q> And parents are commanded in the New Te&s;tament, <Q>to breed up their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</Q> The holy P&s;almi&s;t acquaints us, that one geat end why God did &s;uch great wonders for his people, was, <Q>to the intent that when they grew up, they &s;hould &s;hew their children, or &s;ervants, the &s;ame.</Q> And in Deuteronomy vi. at the 20th and following ver&s;es, God &s;trictly commands his people to in&s;truct their children in the true nature of the ceremonial wor|&s;hip, when they &s;hould inquire about it, as he &s;up|po&s;ed they would do, in time to come. And if &s;er|vants and children were to be in&s;tructed in the nature of Jewi&s;h rites, much more ought they now to be initiated and grounded in the doctrines and fir&s;t principles of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t: not only, becau&s;e it is a revelation, which has brought life and im|mortality to a fuller and clearer light, but al&s;o, becau&s;e many &s;educers are gone abroad into the world, who do their utmo&s;t endeavour to de&s;troy
<PB N="271" REF="028079_0269_0FD695C69078F310">
not only the &s;uper&s;tructure, but likewi&s;e to &s;ap the very foundation of our mo&s;t holy religion.</P>
<P>Would then the pre&s;ent generation have their po&s;terity be true lovers and honourers of God; ma&s;|ters and parents mu&s;t take Solomon's good advice, and train up and catechi&s;e their re&s;pective hou&s;e|holds in the way wherein they &s;hould go.</P>
<P>I am aware but of one objection, that can, with any &s;hew of rea&s;on, be urged again&s;t what has been advanced; which is, that &s;uch a procedure as this will take up too much time, and hinder families too long from their worldly bu&s;ine&s;s. But it is much to be que&s;tioned, whether per&s;ons that &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">art &s;uch an objection, are not of the &s;ame hypocritical &s;pirit as the traitor Judas, who had indignation again&s;t de|vout Mary, for being &s;o profu&s;e of her ointment, in anointing our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, and a&s;ked why it might not be &s;old for two hundred pence, and given to the poor. For has God given us &s;o much time to work for our&s;elves, and &s;hall we not allow &s;ome &s;mall pittance of it, morning and evening, to be devoted to his more immediate wor&s;hip and &s;ervice? Have not people read, that it is God who gives men power to get wealth, and therefore that the be&s;t way to pro&s;per in the world, is to &s;ecure his favour? And has not our ble&s;&s;ed Lord him&s;elf pro|mi&s;ed, that if we &s;eek fir&s;t the kingdom of God and his righteou&s;ne&s;s, all outward nece&s;&s;aries &s;hall be added unto us?</P>
<P>Abraham, no doubt, was a man of as great bu|&s;ine&s;s as &s;uch objectors may be; but yet he would find time to command his hou&s;ehold to &s;erve the Lord. Nay, David was a king, and con&s;equently had a great deal of bu&s;ine&s;s upon his hands: yet notwith&s;tanding, he profe&s;&s;es that he would walk in his hou&s;e with a perfect heart. And, to in&s;tance
<PB N="272" REF="028079_0270_0FD69587AEFBE888">
but one more, holy Jo&s;hua was a per&s;on certainly engaged very much in temporal affairs; and yet he &s;olemnly declares before all I&s;rael, that as for him and his hou&s;ehold, they would &s;erve the Lord. And did per&s;ons but redeem their time as Abraham, David, or Jo&s;hua did, they would no longer com|plain, that family duties kept them too long from the bu&s;ine&s;s of the world.</P>
<P>III. But my third and la&s;t general head, under which I was to offer &s;ome motives in order to excite all governors, with their re&s;pective hou&s;eholds, to &s;erve the Lord in the manner before recommended, I hope, will &s;erve in&s;tead of a thou&s;and arguments, to prove the weakne&s;s and folly of any &s;uch objec|tion.</P>
<P N="1">1. And the fir&s;t motive I &s;hall mention is the duty of gratitude, which you that are governors of families owe to God.&mdash;Your lot, every one mu&s;t confe&s;s, is ca&s;t in a fair ground: providence hath given you a goodly heritage, above many of your fellow creatures; and therefore, out of a principle of gratitude, you ought to endeavour, as much as in you lies, to make every per&s;on of your re&s;pective hou&s;eholds to call upon him as long as they live: not to mention, that the authority, with which God has inve&s;ted you as parents and governors of fami|lies, is a talent committed to your tru&s;t, and which you are bound to improve to your Ma&s;ter's honour. In other things we find governors and parents can exerci&s;e lord&s;hip over their children and &s;ervants readily, and frequently enough can &s;ay to one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he com|eth; to a third, Do this, and he doeth it. And &s;hall this power be &s;o often employed in your own affairs, and never exerted in the things of God? Be a&s;toni&s;hed, O heavens, at this!</P>

Thus did not faithful Abraham; no, God &s;ays, that he knew Abraham would <Q>command his &s;er|vants and children after him.</Q> Thus did not Jo&s;hua; no, he was re&s;olved not only to walk with God him&s;elf, but to improve his authority in mak|ing all about him do &s;o too: <Q>As for me and my hou&s;ehold, we will &s;erve the Lord.</Q> Let us go and do likewi&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. But <HI>Secondly,</HI> If gratitude to God will not, methinks love and pity to your children &s;hould move you, with your re&s;pective families to &s;erve the Lord.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t people expre&s;s a great fondne&s;s for their children: nay &s;o great, that very often their own lives are wrapped up in tho&s;e of their offspring. <Q>Can a woman forget her &s;ucking child, that &s;he &s;hould not have compa&s;&s;ion on the &s;on of her womb?</Q> &s;ays God by his prophet I&s;aiah. He &s;peaks of it as a mon&s;trous thing, and &s;carce credi|ble; but the words immediately following, affirm it to be po&s;&s;ible, yea, they may forget: and expe|rience al&s;o a&s;&s;ures us they may. Father and mother may both for&s;ake their children: for what greater degree of forgetfulne&s;s can they expre&s;s towards them, than to neglect the improvement of their better part, and not bring them up in the knowledge and fear of God?</P>
<P>It is true indeed, parents &s;eldom forget to provide for their children's bodies, (though, it is to be feared, &s;ome men are &s;o far &s;unk beneath the bea&s;ts that peri&s;h, as to neglect even that) but then how often do they forget, or rather, when do they re|member, to &s;ecure the &s;alvation of their immortal &s;ouls? But is this their way of expre&s;&s;ing their fond|ne&s;s for the fruit of their bodies? Is this the be&s;t te&s;|timony they can give of their affection to the darling of their hearts? Then was Dalilah fond of Sam&s;on,

But certainly, if any may be truly cen&s;ured for their inju&s;tice, none can be more liable to &s;uch cen&s;ure, than tho&s;e who think them|&s;elves injured, if their &s;ervants withdraw them|&s;elves from their bodily work, and yet they in re|turn take no care of their ine&s;timable &s;ouls.

<P>It is true; &s;ome men may think they have done enough when they give unto their &s;ervants food and raiment, and &s;ay, did not I bargain with thee for &s;o much a-year?

But how can it be expected they &s;hould learn their duty, except tho&s;e &s;et over them, take care to teach it to them?

<P>Did Chri&s;tanity, indeed, give any countanance to children and &s;ervants to di&s;regard their parents and ma&s;ters according to the fle&s;h, or repre&s;ent their duty to them, as incon&s;i&s;tent with their entire obedience to their Father and Ma&s;ter who is in hea|ven, there might then be &s;ome pretence to neglect in|&s;tructing them in the principles of &s;uch a religion. But &s;ince the precepts of this pure and undefiled religion, are all of them holy, ju&s;t, and good; and the more they are taught their duty to God, the better they will perform their duties to you; methinks to neglect the improvement of their &s;ouls, out of a dread of &s;pending too much time in religi|ous duties, is acting quite contrary to your own intere&s;t as well as duty.</P>

nor even that mo&s;t prevailing motive, &s;elf-intere&s;t, will excite; yet let a con&s;ideration of the terrors of the Lord per&s;uade you to put in practice the pious re&s;olution in the text. Remember, the time will come, and that perhaps very &s;hortly, when we mu&s;t all appear before the judgment &s;eat of Chri&s;t; where we mu&s;t give a &s;olemn and &s;trict account how we have had our conver&s;ation, in our re&s;pective families, in this world. How will you endure to &s;ee your children and &s;ervants (who ought to be your joy and crown of rejoicing in the day of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t) coming out as &s;o many &s;wift witne&s;&s;es again&s;t you; cur&s;ing the father that begot them, the womb that bare them, the paps which they have &s;ucked, and the day they ever entered into your hou&s;es? Think you not, the damnation which men mu&s;t endure for their own &s;ins will be &s;ufficient, that they need load them&s;elves with the additional guilt of being acce&s;&s;ary to the damnation of others al&s;o? O con&s;ider this, all ye that forget to &s;erve the Lord with your re&s;pective hou&s;eholds, <Q>le&s;t he pluck you away, and there be none to de|liver you!</Q></P>
<P>But God forbid, brethren, that any &s;uch evil &s;hould befal you: No, rather will I hope, that you have been in &s;ome mea&s;ure convinced, by what has been &s;aid, of the great importance of Family-reli|gion; and therefore are ready to cry out, in the words immediately following the text, <Q>God for|bid that we &s;hould for&s;ake the Lord;</Q> and again ver&s;e 21. "Nay, but we will" (with our &s;everal hou&s;eholds) "&s;erve the Lord."</P>
<P>And that there may be always &s;uch a heart in you, let me exhort all governors of families, in the name of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, often to reflect on the ine&s;timable worth of their own &s;ouls, and the
<PB N="277" REF="028079_0275_0FD695CAF63B9F08">
infinite ran&s;om, even the precious blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which has been paid down for them. Re|member, that you are fallen creatures; that you are by nature lo&s;t and e&s;tranged from God; and that you can never be re&s;tored to your primitive happi|ne&s;s, till by being born again of the Holy Gho&s;t, you arrive at your primitive &s;tate of purity, have the image of God re&s;tamped upon your &s;ouls, and are thereby made meet to be partakers of the &s;aints in light. Do, I &s;ay, but &s;eriou&s;ly and fre|quently reflect on, and act as per&s;ons that believe &s;uch important truths, and you will no more neglect your family's &s;piritual warfare than your own. No, the love of God, which will be then &s;hed abroad in your hearts, will con&s;train you to do your utmo&s;t to pre&s;erve them: And the deep &s;en&s;e of God's free grace in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, (which you will then have) in calling you, will excite you to do your utmo&s;t to &s;ave others, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of your own hou&s;ehold. And though, after all your pious endeavours, &s;ome may continue unreformed; yet you will have this comfortable reflection to make, that you did what you could to make your families religious: And there|fore may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured of &s;itting down in the king|dom of heaven, with Abraham, Jo&s;hua, and Cor|nelius, and all the godly hou&s;eholders, who in their &s;everal generations &s;hone forth as &s;o many lights in their re&s;pective hou&s;eholds upon earth. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AS God can &s;end a nation or people no greater ble&s;&s;ing, than to give them faithful, &s;incere, and upright mini&s;ters; &s;o the greate&s;t cur&s;e that God can po&s;&s;ibly &s;end upon a people in this world, is to give them over to blind, unregenerate, carnal, lukewarm, and un&s;kilful guides. And yet, in all ages, we find that there have been many wolves in &s;heep's clothing, many that daubed with untemper|ed morter, that prophecied &s;moother things than God did allow. As it was formerly, &s;o it is now, there are many that corrupt the word of God, and deal deceitfully with it. It was &s;o in a &s;pecial manner in the prophet Jeremiah's time; and he, faithful to his Lord, faithful to that God that em|ployed him, did not fail, from time to time, to open his mouth again&s;t them, and to bear a noble te&s;timony to the honour of that God, in who&s;e name he from time to time &s;pake. If ye will read his prophecy, ye will find, that none &s;pake more again&s;t &s;uch mini&s;ters than Jeremiah: and here e&s;pecially, in the chapter out of which the text is taken, he
<PB N="279" REF="028079_0277_0FD695D1AA44FBE0">
&s;peaks very &s;everely again&s;t them; he charges them with &s;everal crimes, particularly, he charges them with covetou&s;ne&s;s: For, &s;ays he in the 13th ver&s;e, <Q>from the lea&s;t of them even to the greate&s;t of them, every one is given to covetou&s;ne&s;s: and from the prophet even unto the prie&s;t, every one dealeth fal&s;ely.</Q> And then in the words of the text, in a more &s;pecial manaer, he exemplifies how they had dealt fal&s;ely, how they had behaved treache|rou&s;ly to poor &s;ouls, &s;ays he, <Q>They have healed al&s;o the hurt of the daughter of my people &s;light|ly, &s;aying, Peace, peace, when there is no peace.</Q> The prophet, in the name of God, had been denouncing war again&s;t the people, he had been telling them, that their hou&s;e &s;hould be left de&s;olate, and the Lord would certainly vi&s;it the land with war, "Therefore," &s;ays he, in the 11th ver&s;e, <Q>I am full of the fury of the Lord: I am weary with holding in: I will pour it out upon the chil|dren abroad, and upon the a&s;&s;embly of young men together: For even the hu&s;band with the wi&s;e &s;hall be taken, the aged with him that is full of days. And their hou&s;es &s;hall be turned unto others, with their fields and wives together: for I will &s;tretch out my hand upon the inhabit|ants of the land, &s;aith the Lord.</Q> The prophet gives a thundering me&s;&s;age, that they might be terrified, and have &s;ome convictions and inclinati|ons to repent: but it &s;eems that the fal&s;e prophets, the fal&s;e prie&s;ts, went about &s;tifling people's con|victions, and when they were hurt or a little terri|fied, they were for daubing over the wound, telling them, that Jeremiah was but an enthu&s;ia&s;tic preach|er; that there could be no &s;uch thing as a war among them; and bidding people <Q>peace, peace, be &s;till,</Q> when the prophet told them there was
<PB N="280" REF="028079_0278_0FD6959310753220">
no peace. The words then refer primarily unto outward things; but I verily believe have al&s;o a further reference to the &s;oul; and are to be referred to tho&s;e fal&s;e teachers, when people were under con|viction of &s;in, when people were beginning to look towards heaven, they were for &s;tifling their con|victions, and telling them they were good enough before. And indeed people generally love to have it &s;o: our hearts are exceedingly deceitful and de&s;|perately wicked; none but the eternal God knows how treacherous they are. How many of us cry, peace, peace to our &s;ouls, when there is no peace. How many are there that are now &s;ettled upon their lees, that now think they are Chri&s;tians, that now flatter them&s;elves that they have an intere&s;t in Je&s;us Chri&s;t; whereas, if we come to examine their ex|periences, we will find that their peace is but a peace of the devil's making; it is not a peace of God's giving; it is not a peace that pa&s;&s;eth human under&s;tanding. It is matter therefore of great im|portance, my dear hearers, to know whether we may &s;peak peace to our hearts: We are all de&s;irous of peace, peace is an un&s;peakable ble&s;&s;ing: How can we live without peace? And therefore people, from time to time, mu&s;t be taught how far they mu&s;t go, and what mu&s;t be wrought in them before they can &s;peak peace to their hearts. This is what I de&s;ign at pre&s;ent, that I may deliver my &s;oul, that I may be free from the blood of all tho&s;e to whom I preach, that I may not fail to declare the whole coun&s;el of God. I &s;hall, from the words of the text, endeavour to &s;hew you what ye mu&s;t undergo, and what mu&s;t be wrought in you, before ye can &s;peak peace to your hearts.</P>
<P>But before I come directly to this, give me leave to premi&s;e a caution or two. And the fir&s;t is, that
<PB N="281" REF="028079_0279_0FD695D3D9C872D8">
I take it for granted ye believe religion to be an inward thing; ye believe it to be a work in the heart, a work wrought in the &s;oul by the power of the &s;pirit of God. If you do not believe this, ye do not believe your bible: If ye do not believe this, though ye have got your bible in your hands, ye hate the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t in your heart: for reli|gion is every where repre&s;ented in &s;cripture, as the work of God in the heart; <Q>the kingdom of God is within us,</Q> &s;ays our Lord; and, <Q>he is not a Chri&s;tian that is one outwardly, but he is a Chri&s;tian who is one inwardly.</Q> If any of you place religion in outward things, I &s;hall not perhaps plea&s;e you this morning; ye will under&s;tand me no more when I &s;peak of the work of God upon a poor &s;inner's heart, than if I were talking in an unknown tongue. I would further premi&s;e a caution, that I would by no means confine God to one way of act|ing; I would by no means &s;ay, that all per&s;ons before they come to have a &s;ettled peace in their hearts, are obliged to undergo the &s;ame degrees of conviction. No; God has various ways of bring|ing his children home; his &s;acred &s;pirit bloweth when, and where and how, it li&s;teth. But however, I will venture to affirm this, that before ever ye can &s;peak peace to your hearts, whether by &s;horter or longer continuance of your convictions, whether in a more pungent or in a more gentle way, ye mu&s;t undergo what I &s;hall hereafter lay down in the fol|lowing di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Then, before ye can &s;peak peace to your hearts, ye mu&s;t be made to &s;ee, made to feel, made to weep over, made to bewail your actual tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions again&s;t the law of God. According to the covenant of works, the &s;oul that &s;inneth it &s;hall die; cur&s;ed is that man, be what he will, be who he
<PB N="282" REF="028079_0280_0FD69594D5D75EA0">
will, that continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them. We are not only to do &s;ome things, but we are to do all things, and we are to continue &s;o to do; &s;o that the lea&s;t deviation from the moral law, according to the covenant of works, whether in thought, word, or deed, de&s;erves eternal death at the hand of God. And if one evil thought, if one evil word, if one evil action, de&s;erves eternal damnation; how many hells, my friends, do every one of us de&s;erve, who&s;e whole lives have been one continual rebellion again&s;t God. Before ever therefore ye can &s;peak peace to your hearts, ye mu&s;t be brought to &s;ee, brought to believe, what a dreadful thing it is to depart from the living God. And now, my dear friends, examine your hearts, for I hope you come hither with a de&s;ign to have your &s;ouls made better; give me leave to a&s;k you, in the pre&s;ence of God, whe|ther you know the time, and if ye do not know exactly the time, do you know there was a time when God wrote bitter things again&s;t you, when the arrows of the Almighty were within you? Was ever the remembrance of your &s;ins grievous to you? Was the burden of your &s;ins intolerable to your thoughts? Did you ever &s;ee that God's wrath might ju&s;tly fall upon you, upon account of your actual tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions again&s;t God? Were ye ever in all your life &s;orry for your &s;ins? Could ye ever &s;ay, my &s;ins are gone over my head as a burden too heavy for me to bear? Did ye ever experience any &s;uch thing as this? Did ever any &s;uch thing as this pa&s;s between God and your &s;oul; if not, for Je&s;us Chri&s;t's &s;ake do not call your&s;elves Chri&s;tians; ye may &s;peak peace to your hearts, but there is no peace. May the Lord a|waken you, may the Lord convert you, may the Lord give you peace, if it be his will, before ye go home.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="028079_0281_0FD695D3DF42D2A8">
But further, ye may be convinced of your actual &s;ins, &s;o as to be made to tremble, and yet ye may be &s;trangers to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, ye may have no true work of grace upon your hearts. Before ever, therefore, ye can &s;peak peace to your hearts, con|viction mu&s;t go deeper; ye mu&s;t not only be con|vinced of your actual tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions again&s;t the law of God, but likewi&s;e of the foundation of all your tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; and what is that? I mean original &s;in; that original corruption each of us brings into the world with us, which renders us liable to God's wrath and damnation. There are many poor &s;ouls that think them&s;elves fine rea&s;oners, yet they pre|tend to &s;ay there is no &s;uch thing as original &s;in? They will charge God with inju&s;tice in imputing Adam's &s;in to us; although we have got the mark of the bea&s;t, and of the devil upon us, yet they tell us, we are not born in &s;in. Let them look abroad into the world, and &s;ee the di&s;orders in it, and think if they can, if this is the paradi&s;e in which God did put man? No, every thing in the world is out of order. I have often thought, when I was abroad, that if there were no other argument to prove origi|nal &s;in, but the ri&s;ing of wolves and tigers again&s;t man, nay, the barking of a dog again&s;t us, is a proof of original &s;in. Tigers and lions dur&s;t not ri&s;e again&s;t us, if it were not for Adam's fir&s;t &s;in: for when the creatures ri&s;e up again&s;t us, it is as much as to &s;ay, ye have &s;inned again&s;t God, and we take up our Ma&s;ter's quarrel. If we look inward, we will &s;ee enough of lu&s;ts, and man's temper con|trary to the temper of God; there is pride, malice, and revenge in all our hearts, and this temper can|not come from God; it comes from our fir&s;t parent, Adam, who, after he fell from God, fell out of God into the devil. However, therefore, &s;ome
<PB N="284" REF="028079_0282_0FD69596DB284540">
people may deny this, yet when conviction comes, all carnal rea&s;onings are batter'd down immediate|ly, and the poor &s;oul begins to feel and &s;ee the foun|tain from which all the polluted &s;treams do flow. When the &s;inner is fir&s;t awakened, he begins to wonder how he came to be &s;o wicked: the Spirit of God then &s;trikes in, and &s;hows that he has no good thing in him by nature; then he &s;ees that he is altogether gone out of the way, that he is altogether become abominable; and the poor creature is made to lie down at the foot of the throne of God, and to acknowledge that God would be ju&s;t to damn him, ju&s;t to cut him off, though he never had committed one actual &s;in in his life. Did ye ever feel and experience this any of you, to ju&s;tify God in your damnation; to own that ye are by nature children of wrath, and that God may ju&s;tly cut you off, though ye never actually had offended him in all your life. If ye were ever truly convicted, if your hearts were ever truly cut, if &s;elf were truly taken out of you, ye will be made to &s;ee and feel this. And if ye have never felt the weight of original &s;in, do not call your&s;elves Chri&s;tians. I am verily per&s;uaded original &s;in is the greate&s;t burden of a true convert; this even grieves the regenerate &s;oul, the &s;anctified &s;oul. The indwelling of &s;in in the heart is the burden of a converted per&s;on; it is the burden of a true Chri&s;tian; he continually cries out, O <Q>Who will deliver me from this body of death,</Q> this indwelling corruption in my heart; this is that which di&s;turbs a poor &s;oul mo&s;t. And, therefore, if ye never felt this inward corruption, if ye never &s;aw that God might ju&s;tly cur&s;e you for it; indeed, my dear friends, ye may &s;peak peace to your heart, but I fear, nay, I know, there is no true peace.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="028079_0283_0FD695D548EFA0D0">
Further, before we can &s;peak peace to your hearts, ye mu&s;t not only be troubled for the &s;ins of your life, the &s;in of your nature, but likewi&s;e for the &s;ins of your be&s;t duties and performances. When a poor &s;oul is &s;omewhat awakened by the terrors of the Lord, then the poor creature, being born under the covenant of works flies directly to a covenant of works again. And as Adam and Eve hid them|&s;elves among the trees of the garden, and &s;ewed fig-leaves together to cover their nakedne&s;s; &s;o the poor &s;inner when awakened, flies to his duties, and to his performances, to hide him&s;elf from God; and goes to patch up a righteou&s;ne&s;s of his own; &s;ays he, I will be mighty good now; I will reform, I will do all I can, and then certainly Je&s;us Chri&s;t will have mercy on me. But before ye can &s;peak peace to your heart, ye mu&s;t be brought to &s;ee that God may damn you for the be&s;t prayer ye ever put up in all your life: ye mu&s;t be brought to &s;ee all your duties, all your righteou&s;ne&s;s, as the prophet elegantly expre&s;&s;es it, put them altogether, are &s;o far from recommending you to God, are &s;o far from being any motive and inducement to God to have mercy on your poor &s;ouls, that ye will &s;ee them to be filthy rags, a men&s;truous cloth; that God hates them, and cannot away with them, if ye bring them to him in order to recommend you to his fa|vour. My dear friends, what is there in our per|formances to recommend us unto God; our per&s;ons are in an un&s;anctified &s;tate by nature, we de&s;erve to be damned ten thou&s;and times over; and what mu&s;t our performances <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e? We can do no good thing by nature; <Q>they that are in the fle&s;h can|not plea&s;e God.</Q> Ye may do things materially good, but ye cannot do a thing formally and rightly good; becau&s;e nature cannot act above it|&s;elf.
<PB N="286" REF="028079_0284_0FD695988A47CA48">
It is impo&s;&s;ible that a man that is unconverted can act for the glory of God; he cannot do any thing in faith, for <Q>what&s;oever is not of faith is &s;in.</Q> After we are renewed, yet we are renew|ed but in part; indwelling &s;in continues in us; there is a mixture of corruption in every one of our duties: &s;o that after we are converted, were Je&s;us Chri&s;t only to accept us according to our works, our works would damn us; for we cannot put up a prayer but it is far from that perfection which the moral law requireth. I do not know what ye may think; but I can &s;ay that I cannot pray but I &s;in; I cannot preach to you or any others but I &s;in; I can do nothing without &s;in: and, as one expre&s;&s;eth it, my repentance wants to be repented of, and my tears to be wa&s;hed in the precious blood of my dear Re|deemer; our be&s;t duties are as &s;o many &s;plendid &s;ins. Before ye can &s;peak peace to your hearts, ye mu&s;t not only be &s;ick of your original and actual &s;ins; but ye mu&s;t be made &s;ick of your righteou&s;|ne&s;s, of all your duties and performances, There mu&s;t be a deep conviction before ye can be brought out of your &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s; it is the la&s;t idol that is taken out of our heart, the pride of our heart will not let us &s;ubmit to the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. But if ye never felt that ye had no righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of your own; if ye never felt the defici|ency of your own righteou&s;ne&s;s, ye can never come to Je&s;us Chri&s;t. There are a great many now that may &s;ay, Well, we believe all this: but there is a great difference betwixt talking and feeling. Did ye ever feel the want of a dear Redeemer? Did ye ever feel the want of Je&s;us Chri&s;t upon the account of the deficiency of your own righteou&s;ne&s;s? And can ye now &s;ay from your heart, Lord, thou maye&s;t ju&s;tly damn me for the be&s;t duties that ever I did

<P>But then before ye can &s;peak peace to your &s;ouls there is one particular &s;in ye mu&s;t be greatly trou|bled for; and yet I fear there are few of you think what it is: it is the reigning, the damning &s;in of the Chri&s;tian world; and yet the Chri&s;tian world &s;eldom or never think of it; and pray what is that? It is what mo&s;t of you think ye are not guilty of, and that is the &s;in of unbelief; before we can &s;peak peace to your heart, ye mu&s;t be troubled for the unbelief of your heart; but can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that any of you are unbelievers here in this church-yard, that are born in Scotland, in a reformed country, that go to church every Sabbath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Can any of you that receive the &s;acrament once a year?

Can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that you that had tokens for the &s;acrament; that you that keep up family-prayer, that any of you do not believe on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t? I appeal to your own hearts, if ye would not think me uncharitable, if I doubted whether any of you believed in Chri&s;t; and yet I fear, upon examination, we &s;hould find that mo&s;t of you have not &s;o much faith in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t as the devil him&s;elf. I am per&s;uaded the devil believes more of the bible than mo&s;t of us do; he believes the divinity of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that is more than many that call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians do; nay, he believes and trembles, and that is more than thou&s;ands among&s;t us do. My friends, we mi&s;take an hi&s;torical faith for a true faith wrought in the heart by the Spirit of God. Ye fancy ye believe, becau&s;e ye believe there is &s;uch a book we call the bible, becau&s;e ye go to church; all this ye may do, and have no true faith in Chri&s;t. Merely

to believe there was once &s;uch a per&s;on as Chri&s;t, merely to believe there is &s;uch a book called the bible, will do you no good, more than to believe there was &s;uch a man as Cae&s;ar or Alexander the Great. The bible is a &s;acred depo&s;itory; what thanks have we to give to God for the&s;e lively oracles! But yet we may have the&s;e, and not believe in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. My dear friends, there mu&s;t be a principle wrought in the heart by the Spirit of the living God. Did I a&s;k you how long it is &s;ince ye believed in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, I &s;uppo&s;e mo&s;t of you would tell me, ye believed in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t as long as ever ye remember; ye never did di&s;|believe: then ye could not give me a better proof that ye never yet believed in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, unle&s;s ye were &s;anctified early from the womb; for they that believe in Chri&s;t, know there was a time when they did not believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. You &s;ay you love God with all your heart, &s;oul, and &s;trength; if I were to a&s;k you, how long it is &s;ince ye loved God, ye would &s;ay, as long as ye can remember ye never hated God; ye know no time when there was en|mity in your heart again&s;t God: then unle&s;s ye were &s;anctified very early, ye never loved God in your life. My dear friends, I am more particular in this, becau&s;e it is a mo&s;t deceitful delu&s;ion, whereby &s;o many people are carried away, that they believe already. Therefore it is remarkable of Mr. Mar&s;hall giving account of his experiences, he had been working for life, he had ranged all his &s;ins under the ten commandments, and then coming to a mini&s;ter, a&s;ked him the rea&s;on why he could not get peace: the mini&s;ter looked to the catalogue, <Q>Away, &s;ays he, I do not find one word of the &s;in of unbelief in all your catalogue.</Q> It is the peculiar work of the Spirit of God to convince us

of our unbelief, that we have got no faith. Says Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <Q>I will &s;end the Comforter; and when he is come, he will reprove the world of the &s;in of unbelief: Of &s;in, &s;ays Chri&s;t, becau&s;e they believe not on me.</Q> Now, my dear friends, did God does &s;hew you that ye had no faith?

Have ye clo&s;ed with Chri&s;t? Is God your friend? Is Chri&s;t your friend? Then look up with comfort; all is yours, and ye are Chri&s;t's, and Chri&s;t is God's; every thing &s;hall work together for your good; the very hairs of your head are numbered; he that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of God's eye. But then, my dear friends, take care of re&s;ting on your fir&s;t conver&s;ion: ye that are young believers in Chri&s;t, ye &s;hould be looking out for fre&s;h di&s;co|veries of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t every moment: ye mu&s;t not build upon your pa&s;t experiences; ye mu&s;t not build upon a work within you, but always come out of your&s;elves to the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t without you: ye mu&s;t be always coming as poor &s;inners to draw water out of the wells of &s;alvation; ye mu&s;t be forgetting the things that are behind, and be continually pre&s;&s;ing forward to the things that are before. My dear friends, ye mu&s;t keep up a tender clo&s;e walk with the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Many of us lo&s;e our peace by our untender walk.

O take care of going a gadding and wandering from God; after ye have clo&s;ed with Je&s;us Chri&s;t. My dear friends, I have paid dear for back&s;liding. Our hearts are &s;o cur&s;edly wicked, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">word ye take not care, if ye do not keep up a con&s;tant watch, your wicked hearts will deceive you, and draw you a&s;ide. It will be &s;ad to be under the &s;courge of a cor|recting father; witne&s;s the vi&s;itation of Job, David, and other &s;aints in &s;cripture. Let me, therefore, exhort you that have got peace to keep a clo&s;e walk with Chri&s;t. I am grieved with the loo&s;e walk of tho&s;e that are Chri&s;tians, that have had di&s;coveries of Je&s;us Chri&s;t: there is &s;o little differ not betwixt them and other people, that I can &s;carce know which is the true Chri&s;tian. Chri&s;tians are afraid to &s;peak for God; they run down with the &s;tream; if they come into worldly company, they will talk of the world, as if they were in their element: This ye would not do when ye had the fir&s;t di&s;co|veries of Chri&s;t's love; ye could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> then of Chri&s;t's love for ever, when the candle of the Lord &s;hined upon your &s;oul. The time has been when ye had &s;omething to &s;ay for your dear Lord; but now ye can go into company, and hear others &s;peaking about the world bold enough, and ye are afraid of being laughed at, if ye &s;peak for Je&s;us Chri&s;t. A great many people have grown conformi&s;ts now in the wor&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word; they will cry out again&s;t the ceremonies of the church, as they may ju&s;tly do; But then yet are mighty fond of ceremonies in your behaviour; ye will conform to the world, which is

a great deal wor&s;e; many will &s;tay till the devil bring up new fa&s;hions. Take care then not to be conformed to the world: What have Chri&s;tians to do with the world? Chri&s;tians &s;hould be &s;ingularly good, bold for their Lord, that all that are with you may take notice that ye have been with Je&s;us. I would exhort you to come to a &s;ettlement in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;o as to have a continual abiding of God in your heart. We go a building on our faith of ad|herence, and lo&s;e our comfort; but we &s;hould be growing up to a faith of a&s;&s;urance, to know that we are God's, and &s;o walk in the comfort of the Holy Gho&s;t and be edified. Je&s;us Chri&s;t is now much wounded in the hou&s;e of his friends. Excu&s;e me in being particular; for, my friends, it grieves me more that Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hould be wounded by his friends as by his enemies. We cannot expect any thing el&s;e from Dei&s;ts; but for &s;uch as have felt his power to fall away, for them not to walk agreeably to the vocation wherewith they are called, by the&s;e means we bring our Lord's religion into contempt; to be a byword among the Heathens. For Chri&s;t's &s;ake, if ye know Chri&s;t keep clo&s;e by him; if God hath &s;poken peace, O keep that peace, by looking up to Je&s;us Chri&s;t every moment. Such as have got peace with God if ye are under trials, fear not, all things &s;hall work for your good; if ye are under temptations, fear not; if he has &s;poken peace to your heart, all the&s;e things &s;hall be for your good.</P>

Awake then, ye that are &s;leeping in a fal&s;e peace; awake, ye care|le&s;s profe&s;&s;ors; ye hypocrites that go to church, re|ceive the &s;acrament, read your bibles, and never felt the power of God upon your heart: ye that are formal profe&s;&s;ors, ye that are baptized heathens, awake, awake, and do not re&s;t on a fal&s;e bottom.

O ye that are &s;ecure, I mu&s;t be a &s;on of thunder to you; and O that God may awaken you, though it be with thunder. It is out of love indeed that I &s;peak to you. I know, by &s;ad expe|rience, what it is to be lulled a&s;leep with a fal&s;e peace. Long was I lulled a&s;leep; long did I think my&s;elf a Chri&s;tian, when I knew nothing of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. I went perhaps further than many of you do; I u&s;ed to fa&s;t twice a week; I u&s;ed to pray &s;ometimes nine times a day; I u&s;ed to receive the &s;acrament con&s;tantly every Lord's day; and yet I knew nothing of Je&s;us Chri&s;t in my heart.

But I hope there are &s;ome that are a little wounded. I hope God does not intend to let me preach in vain. I hope God will reach &s;ome of your precious &s;ouls, and awaked &s;ome of you out of your carnal &s;ecurity. I hope there are &s;ome that are willing to come to Chri&s;t, and beginning to think that they have been building upon a fal&s;e foundation. Perhaps the devil may &s;trike in, and may bid you de&s;pair of mercy; but fear not: what I have been &s;peaking to you, is only out of love to you, is only to awaken you, and let you &s;ee your danger. If any of you are willing to be reconciled to God, the Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t is willing to be reconciled to you. O then, though ye have no peace as yet, come away to Je&s;us Chri&s;t; he is our peace; he is our peace-maker; he has made peace between God and offending man. Would you have peace with God? Away then to God, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who has purcha&s;ed peace.

And after Chri&s;t ro&s;e from the dead, he came preaching peace with an olive-branch of peace in his mouth as Noah's dove, <Q>My peace I leave with you.</Q> Who were obey? They were the enemies of Chri&s;t as well as we they were deniers of Chri&s;t once as well as we.

When the people came to apprehend Chri&s;t, they fell to the ground when Je&s;us &s;aid, I am he: and if they could not bear the fight of Chri&s;t when clothed with the rags of mortality, how will they bear the fight of him when he is on his Father's throne? Methinks I &s;ee the poor wretches dragged out of their graves by the devil, methinks I &s;ee them trembling, cry|ing out to the hills and rocks to cover them. But the devil will &s;ay, Come, I will take you away; and then they will &s;tand trembling before the judg|ment &s;eat of Chri&s;t. They &s;hall appear before him to &s;ee him once, and hear him pronounce that irre|vocable &s;entence, "Depart from me, ye cur&s;ed." Methinks I hear the poor creatures &s;aying, Lord, if we mu&s;t be damned, let &s;ome angel pronounce

the &s;entence. No, the God of love, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, will pronounce it. Will ye not believe this? Do not think I am talking at random, but agreeable to the &s;criptures of truth. If ye do then &s;hew your|&s;elves men, and this morning go away with full re&s;olution, in the &s;trength of God, to cleave to Chri&s;t. And may ye have no re&s;t in your &s;oul till ye re&s;t in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. I could &s;till go on, for it is &s;weet to talk of Chri&s;t. Do ye not long for the time when ye &s;hall have new bodies, when they &s;hall be immortal, and made like Chri&s;t's glorious body, and then they will talk of Je&s;us Chri&s;t for evermore. But it is time perhaps for you to go and prepare for your re&s;pective wor&s;hip, and I would not hinder any of you. My de&s;ign is to bring poor &s;inners to Je&s;us Chri&s;t. O that God may bring &s;ome of you to him&s;elf. May the Lord Je&s;us now di&s;mi&s;s you with his ble&s;&s;ing; and may the dear Redeemer con|vince you that are unawakened, and turn the wick|ed from the evil of their way. And may the love of God that pa&s;&s;eth all under&s;tanding fill your heart.

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>MATTHEW xxv. 13.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour in which the Son of man cometh.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE apo&s;tle Paul, in his epi&s;tle to the Hebrews, informs us, <Q>that it is appointed for all men once to die; after that in the judgment.</Q> And I think, if any con&s;ideration be &s;ufficient to awaken a &s;leeping drow&s;y world, it mu&s;t be this, that there will be a day wherein the&s;e heavens &s;hall be wrapt up like a &s;croll, this element melt with fervent heat, the earth and all things therein be burnt up, and every &s;oul, of every nation and lan|guage, &s;ummoned to appear before the dreadful tribunal of the righteous Judge of quick and dead, to receive rewards and puni&s;hments, according to the deeds done in their bodies. The great apo&s;tle ju&s;t mentioned, when brought before Felix, could think of no better means to convert that &s;inful man, than to rea&s;on of temperance, righteou&s;ne&s;s, and more e&s;pecially of a judgment to come. The fir&s;t might in &s;ome mea&s;ure affect, but I am per&s;ua|ded, it was the la&s;t con&s;ideration, a judgment to come, that made him to tremble: and &s;o bad as the world is now grown, yet there are few have their con&s;ciences &s;o far <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eared, as to deny that there will
<PB N="301" REF="028079_0299_0FD695FD0A5F74E0">
be a reckoning he ea&s;ter. The promi&s;cuous di&s;pen|&s;ations of providence in this life, wherein we &s;ee good men afflicted, de&s;titute, tormented, and the wicked permitted triumphantly to ride over their heads, has been always looked upon as an indi&s;pu|table argument, by the generality of men, that there will be a day in which God will judge the world in righteou&s;ne&s;s, and admini&s;ter equity unto his people. Some indeed are &s;o bold as to deny it, while they are engaged in the pur&s;uit of the lu&s;t of the eye, and the pride of life; but follow them to their death-beds, a&s;k them, when their &s;ouls are ready to launch into eternity, what they then think of judgment to come? and they will tell you, they dare not give their con&s;ciences the lie any longer. They feel a fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation in their hearts. Since then the&s;e things are &s;o, does it not highly concern each of us, my brethren, before we come on a bed of &s;ickne&s;s, &s;eriou&s;ly to examine how the account &s;tands between God and our &s;ouls, and how it will fare with us in that day? As for the openly profane, the drunkard, the whoremonger, the adul|terer, and &s;uch like, there is no doubt of what will become of them; without repentence, they &s;hall never enter into the kingdom of God and his Chri&s;t: No; their damnation &s;lumbereth not: a burning fiery Tophet, kindled by the fury of God's eternal wrath, is prepared for their reception, wherein they mu&s;t &s;uffer the vengeance of eternal fire. Nor is there the lea&s;t doubt of the &s;tate of true believers. For though they are de&s;pi&s;ed and rejected of natural men, yet being born again of God, they are heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Chri&s;t. They have the earne&s;t of the promi&s;ed inheritance in their hearts, and are a&s;&s;ured, that
<PB N="302" REF="028079_0300_0FD628BC8E832DF0">
a new and living way is made open for them, into the holy of holies, by the blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, into which an abundant entrance &s;hall be admi|ni&s;tered to them at the great day of account. The only que&s;tion is, what will become of the al|mo&s;t Chri&s;tian, one that is content to go, as he thinks, in a middle way to heaven, without being profane on the one hand, or, as he fal&s;ely imagines, righteous over-much on the other? Many there are in every congregation, and con&s;equently &s;ome here pre&s;ent, of this &s;tamp. And what is wor&s;t of all, it is more ea&s;y to convince the mo&s;t notorious pub|licans and &s;inners of their being out of a &s;tate of &s;alvation, than any of the&s;e. Notwith&s;tanding, if Je&s;us Chri&s;t may be your judge, they &s;hall as cer|tainly be rejected and di&s;owned by him at the la&s;t day, as though they lived in open defiance to all his laws.</P>
<P>For, what &s;ays our Lord in the parable of which the words of the text are a conclu&s;ion, and which I intend to make the &s;ubject of my pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e: "Then," at the day of judgment, which he had been di&s;cour&s;ing of in the foregoing, and pro&s;ecutes in this chapter, "&s;hall the kingdom of heaven," the &s;tate of profe&s;&s;ors in the go&s;pel-church, <Q>be likened unto ten virgins, who took up their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.</Q> In which words, is a manife&s;t allu&s;ion to a cu&s;tom pre|vailing in our Lord's time among the Jews, at marriage-&s;olemnities which were generally at night and at which it was cu&s;tomary for the per&s;ons of the bride-chamber to go out in proce&s;&s;ion, with many lights, to meet the bridegroom.</P>
<P>By the bridegroom, you are here to under&s;tand Je&s;us Chri&s;t. The church, that is, true believers, are his &s;pou&s;e; he is united to them by one &s;pirit,
<PB N="303" REF="028079_0301_0FD696021CC63600">
even in this life; but the &s;olemnizing of the&s;e &s;acred nuptials is re&s;erved till the day of judgment, when he &s;hall come to take them home to him&s;elf, and pre&s;ent them before men and angels, as his purcha&s;e to his Father, without &s;pot or wrinkle, or any &s;uch thing. By the ten virgins we are to under&s;tand the profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity in general. Are all called virgins, becau&s;e all are called to be &s;aints? Who&s;oever names the name of Chri&s;t is obliged by that very profe&s;&s;ion to depart from all iniquity. But the pure and cha&s;te in heart, are the only per&s;ons that will be &s;o ble&s;&s;ed as to &s;ee God. As Chri&s;t was born of a virgin, &s;o he can dwell in none but virgin &s;ouls, made pure and holy by the cohabitation of his Holy Spirit. What &s;ays the apo&s;tle? "All are not I&s;raelites that are of "I&s;rael," all are not Chri&s;tians that are called after the name of Chri&s;t: No, &s;ays our Lord in the 2d ver&s;e, "Five of tho&s;e virgins were wi&s;e," true believers, "and five were fooli&s;h," formal hypocrites. But why are five <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aid to be wi&s;e, and the other five fooli&s;h? Hear what our Lord &s;ays in the following ver&s;es; <Q>They that were fooli&s;h took their lamps, and took no oil with them; but the wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e took oil in their ve&s;&s;els with their lamps.</Q> They that were fooli&s;h took their lamps of an outward profe&s;&s;ion." They would go to church, &s;ay over many manuals of prayers, come perhaps even in a field to hear &s;ermon, give at a collection, and receive the &s;acrament con|&s;tantly, nay, oftener than once a month. But then here lay the mi&s;take; they had no oil in their lamps, no principle of grace, no living faith in their hearts, without which, though we &s;hould give all our goods to feed the poor, and our bodies to be burned, it would profit us nothing. In &s;hort,
<PB N="304" REF="028079_0302_0FD695E69920DC80">
they were exact, nay, perhaps &s;uper&s;titious bigots as to the form, but all the while they were &s;trangers to, and, in effect, denied the power of godline&s;s in their hearts. They would go to church, but at the &s;ame time, think it no harm to go to a hall or an a&s;&s;embly, notwith&s;tanding they promi&s;ed at their bapti&s;m to renounce the pomps and vanities of this wicked world. They were &s;o exceedingly fearful of being righteous overmuch, that they would even per&s;ecute tho&s;e that were truly devout, if they at|temted to go a &s;tep farther than them&s;elves. In one word, they never effectually felt the power of the world to come. They thought they might be Chri&s;tians without &s;o much inward feeling, and therefore, notwith&s;tanding their high preten&s;ions, had only a name to live.</P>
<P>And now, &s;irs, let me pau&s;e a while, and, in the name of God, whom I endeavour to &s;erve in the go&s;pel of his dear Son, give me leave to a&s;k one que&s;tion. Whil&s;t I have been drawing, though in miniature, the character of the&s;e fooli&s;h virgins, have not many of your con&s;ciences made the appli|cation and with a &s;mall, &s;till, though articulate voice, &s;aid, thou man, thou woman, art one of tho&s;e fooli&s;h virgins, for thy &s;entiments and prac|tice agree thereto? Stifle not, but rather encourrage the&s;e convictions; and, who knows but that Lord who is rich in mercy to all that call upon him faith|fully, may &s;o work on you even now by this fooli&s;h|ne&s;s of preaching, as to make you wi&s;e virgins?</P>
<P>What they were you &s;hall know immediately: <Q>But the wi&s;e took oil in their ve&s;&s;els with their lamps.</Q> Ob&s;erve, the wi&s;e, the true believers, had their lamps as well as the fooli&s;h virgins; for Chri&s;tianity does not require us to ca&s;t of all outward, forms; we may u&s;e forms and yet not be formal:
<PB N="305" REF="028079_0303_0FD628B8612CEB80">
For in&s;tance, it is po&s;&s;ible to wor&s;hip God in a &s;et form of prayer, and yet wor&s;hip him in &s;pirit and in truth. And therefore, brethren, let us not judge one another: The wi&s;e virgins had their lamps; herein then did not lie the difference between them and the fooli&s;h, that one wor&s;hipped God with a form, and the other did not: No: as the Phari&s;ee and Publican went up to the temple to pray, &s;o the&s;e wi&s;e and fooli&s;h virgins might go to the &s;ame place of wor&s;hip, and &s;it under the &s;ame mini&s;try; but then the wi&s;e took oil in their ve&s;&s;els with their lamps: they kept up the form, but did not re&s;t in it: their words in prayer were the language of their hearts, and they were no &s;trangers to inward feelings; they had &s;avingly ta&s;ted the good word of life, and felt or had an experimental knowledge of the power of the world to come; they were not afraid of &s;earching doctrines, nor affronted when mini&s;ters told them they by nature de&s;erved to be damned: they were not &s;elf-righteous, but were willing that Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hould have all the glory of their &s;alvation; they were convinced that the merits of Je&s;us Chri&s;t were to be apprehended only by faith; but yet were they as careful to maintain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> works, as though they were to be ju&s;tified by them: In &s;hort, their obedience flowed from love and gratitude, and was cheerful, con&s;tant, uniform, univer&s;al, like that obedience which the holy angels pay our Father in heaven.</P>
<P>Here then let me exhort you to pau&s;e again; and if any of you can faithfully apply the&s;e characters to your hearts, give God the glory, and take the com|fort to your own &s;ouls; you are not fal&s;e but true believers. Je&s;us Chri&s;t has been made of God to you wi&s;dom, even that wi&s;dom, whereby you &s;hall be made wi&s;e unto &s;alvation. God &s;ees a difference

between you and fooli&s;h virgins, if natural men will not. You need not be unea&s;y, though one chance and fate in this life may happen to you both. I &s;ay, one chance and fate: for ver&s;e 5, "while the bridegroom tarried." in the &s;pace of time which pa&s;&s;eth between our Lord's a&s;cen&s;ion and his coming again to judgment, "they all &s;lumbered and &s;lept." The wi&s;e as well as the fool|i&s;h died, for du&s;t we are, and to du&s;t we mu&s;t return. It is no reflection at all upon the divine goodne&s;s that believers, as well as hypocrites, mu&s;t pa&s;s through the valley of the &s;hadow of death; for Chri&s;t has taken away the &s;ting of death, &s;o that we need fear no evil. It is to them a pa&s;&s;age to everla&s;ting life: Death is only terrible to tho&s;e who have no hope, becau&s;e they live without faith, and therefore without God in the world. Who&s;oever there are among&s;t you, that have received the fir&s;t fruits of the Spirit, I am per&s;uaded are ready to cry out, we would not live here always; we long to be di&s;&s;olved, that we may be with Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and though worms mu&s;t de&s;troy our bodies as well as others, yet we are content, being a&s;&s;ured that our Redeemer liveth, that he will &s;tand at the latter days upon the earth, and that in our fle&s;h we &s;hall &s;ee God.</P>
<P>But it is not &s;o with hypocrites and unbelievers beyond the grave; for what &s;ays our Lord? <Q>And at midnight,</Q> Ob&s;erve at midnight, when all was hu&s;hed and quiet, and no one dreaming of any &s;uch thing, "a cry was made;" the voice of the archangel and the trump of God was heard &s;ounding this general alarm; to things in heaven, to things in earth, and to things in the waters under the earth, Behold! mark how this awful &s;ummons is u&s;hered in the word, Behold, to engage our atten|tion

"Behold the bridegroom cometh?" even Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the de&s;ire of nations, the bridegroom of his &s;pou&s;e, the church: Becau&s;e he tarried for a while to exerci&s;e the faith of &s;aints, and give &s;in|ners &s;pace to repent, &s;coffers were apt to cry out, <Q>Where is the promi&s;e of his coming? But the Lord is not &s;lack concerning his promi&s;e, as the&s;e men account &s;lackne&s;s.</Q> For behold, he that was to come, now cometh, and will not tarry any longer: He cometh to be glorified in his &s;aints, and to take vengeance on them that know not God, and have not obeyed his go&s;pel: He cometh not as a poor de&s;pi&s;ed Galilean; not to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a &s;tinking manger; not to be de&s;pi&s;ed and rejected of men; not to be blind-folded, &s;pit upon, and buffetted; not to be nailed to an accur&s;ed tree; he cometh not as the Son of man, but as he really was, the eternal Son of the eternal God: He cometh riding on the wings of the wind, in the glory of the Father and his holy angels, and to be had in everla&s;ting re|verence of all that &s;hall be round about him. Go ye forth to meet him; ari&s;e ye dead, ye fooli&s;h, as well as wi&s;e virgins, ari&s;e, and come to judgment. Multitudes, no doubt, that hear this awakening cry, would rejoice, if the rocks might fall on, and the hills cover them from the pre&s;ence of the Lamb: What would they give, if, as the lived as bea&s;ts, they might now die like the bea&s;ts that peri&s;h? How would they rejoice, if tho&s;e &s;ame excu&s;es, which they made on this &s;ide eternity, for not attending on holy ordinances, would &s;erve to keep them from appearing before the heavenly bridegroom! But as Adam, notwith&s;tanding his fig-leaves, and the trees of the garden, could not hide him&s;elf from God, when arre&s;ted with an, <HI>Adam where art thou?</HI> So now the decree is gone forth, and the trump of God

I doubt not but many of the&s;e fooli&s;h virgins, whil&s;t in this world, were clothed in pur|ple and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> linen, fared &s;umptuou&s;ly every day, and di&s;dained to &s;et the wi&s;e virgins, &s;ome of whom might he as poor as Lazarus, even with the dogs of their flock.

Whil&s;t with you in the body, how often have you condemned us for our zeal in running to hear the word of God, and looked on us as en|thu&s;ia&s;ts, for affirming, that we mu&s;t be led and walk by the Spirit, and feel the Spirit of God wit|ne&s;&s;ing with our &s;pirits, that we are his children? Now you would be glad to be partakers of this pri|vilege, but it is not ours to give. You contented your&s;elves with &s;eeking, when you &s;hould have been &s;triving to enter in at the &s;trait gate; and now go to them that &s;ell, "and buy for your&s;elves."</P>
<P>And what &s;ay you to this, ye fooli&s;h formal pro|fe&s;&s;ors? for I doubt not but curio&s;ity and novelty have brought many &s;uch, even to this de&s;pi&s;ed place, to hear a &s;ermon. Can you hear this reply, and yet not tremble? Why yet a little while, and thus it &s;hall be done to you. Rejoice and bol&s;ter your&s;elves up in your duties and form<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">; endeavour to cover your nakedne&s;s with the fig-leaves of an outward profe&s;&s;ion, and legal righteou&s;ne&s;s, and de&s;pi&s;e the true &s;ervants or Chri&s;t as much as you plea&s;e, yet know, that all your hopes will fall you when God brings you into judgment. For not he who commendeth him&s;elf is ju&s;tified, but he whom the Lord commendeth.</P>
<P>But to return; we do not hear of any reply the fooli&s;h virgins make: no, their con&s;ciences con|demned them; like the per&s;on without a wedding-garment, they are &s;truck dumb, and are now filled with anxious thoughts how they &s;hall buy oil, that

they may lift up their heads before the bridegroom. "But whil&s;t they went to buy," the bridegroom, the Lord Je&s;us, the king, the hu&s;band of his &s;pou&s;e the church, cometh, attended with thou&s;ands and twenty times ten thou&s;ands of &s;aints and angels, publicly to count up his jewels; and they that were ready, the wi&s;e virgins who had oil in their lamps, and were &s;ealed by his Spirit to the day of redemption, having on the wedding-garment of an imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s, and a new nature, went in to the marriage.</P>
<P>Who can expre&s;s the tran&s;ports the&s;e wi&s;e virgins felt, when they were thus admitted, in holy tri|umph, into the pre&s;ence and full enjoyment of him, whom their &s;ouls hungered and thir&s;ted after. No doubt they had ta&s;ted of his love, and by faith had often fed on him in their hearts, when &s;itting down to commemorate his la&s;t &s;upper here on earth; but how full may we think their hearts and tongues were of his prai&s;es, when they &s;ee them&s;elves &s;eated to|gether to eat bread in his heavenly kingdom. And what was be&s;t of all the door was &s;hut, and &s;hut them in, to enjoy the ever ble&s;&s;ed God, the com|pany of angels, and the &s;pirits of ju&s;t man-made perfect, for ever. I &s;ay, without interruption for in this life, their eyes often gu&s;hed out with water, becau&s;e men kept not God's law; and they could never come to appear before the Lord, or to hear his word, but Satan and his emi&s;&s;aries would come al&s;o to di&s;turb them: but now the door is &s;hut, now there is a perfect communion of &s;aints, which they in vain longed for in this lower world, now tares no longer grow up with the wheat; no hypo|crite or unbeliever, can &s;creen him&s;elf among them. Now "the wicked cea&s;e from troubling" and now their weary &s;ouls enjoy re&s;t.</P>

Once more, O believers, let me exhort you in patience to po&s;&s;e&s;s your &s;ouls. God, has &s;ealed you to be his, and has &s;ecured you, as &s;urely as he did Noah, when he locked him in the ark. But though heirs of God, and joint-heirs of Chri&s;t, and neither men nor devils can pluck you out of your heavenly Father's hands, yet you mu&s;t be to&s;&s;ed about with manifold temptations; however, lift up your heads, the day of your perfect complete redemption draws nigh. Behold the bridegroom cometh to take you to him&s;elf; then you &s;hall be ever with the Lord.</P>
<P>But I even tremble to tell you, O nominal Chri&s;|tians! that the door &s;hall be &s;hut, I mean the door of mercy, never to be opened to give you admi&s;&s;ion, tho' you &s;hould continue knocking to all eternity. For thus &s;peaks our Lord, "Afterwards," after tho&s;e that were ready went in, and the door was &s;hut; after they had, to their &s;orrow, &s;ound that no oil was to be bought, nor grace procured, <Q>came al&s;o the other virgins;</Q> and as E&s;au, after Jacob had got the ble&s;&s;ing, cried with an exceeding bitter cry, "Ble&s;s me, even me al&s;o, O my father;" &s;o they came, &s;aying, "Lord, Lord, open to us." Ob&s;erve the importunity of the&s;e fooli&s;h virgins, implied in the&s;e words, Lord, Lord. Whil&s;t in the body, I &s;uppo&s;e they only read, did not pray over their prayers. If you now tell them, they &s;hould pray without cea&s;ing, they &s;hould pray from their hearts, and feel the want of what they prayed for; they would an&s;wer, they could not tell what you mean by inward feelings; that God did not require us to be always on our knees; but if a man did ju&s;tly, and loved mercy, and did as the church-forms required him, it was as much as the Lord re|quired at his hands.</P>
<P>I fear, &s;irs, too many among us are of this mind:
<PB N="314" REF="028079_0312_0FD695F04A741A08">
nay, I fear there are many &s;o polite, &s;o void of the love of God, as to think it too great a piece of &s;elf-denial, to ri&s;e early to offer up a &s;acrifice of prai&s;e and thank&s;giving acceptable to God through Je&s;us Chri&s;t. If any &s;uch, by the good providence of God, are brought hither this morning, I be&s;eech you to con&s;ider your ways, and remember, if you are not awakened out of your &s;piritual lethargy, and live a life of prayer here, you &s;hall but in vain cry but with the fooli&s;h virgins, <Q>Lord, Lord, open to us,</Q> hereafter. Ob&s;erve farther, the impudence, as well as importunity of the&s;e other virgins; Lord, Lord, &s;ay they, as though they were intimately acquainted with the holy Je&s;us. Like numbers among us, who becau&s;e they go to church, repeat their creeds, and receive the ble&s;&s;ed &s;acrament, think they have a right to call Je&s;us their Saviour, and dare call, God their Father, when they put up the Lord's prayer. But Je&s;us is not your Saviour. The devil, not God, is your father, unle&s;s your hearts are purified by faith, and you are born again from above. It is not merely being baptized by water, but being born again of the Holy Gho&s;t, that mu&s;t qualify you for &s;alva|tion; and it will do you no &s;ervice at the great day, to &s;ay unto Chri&s;t, Lord, my name is in the regi&s;|ter of &s;uch and &s;uch a pari&s;h. I am per&s;uaded, the fooli&s;h virgins could &s;ay this and more. But what an&s;wer did the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us make? He an&s;wered and &s;aid, "Verily, I &s;ay unto you:" He puts the word verily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a&s;&s;ure them he was in earne&s;t. <Q>I &s;ay unto you,</Q> I who am truth it&s;elf, I whom you have owned in words, but in works denied, "verily, I &s;ay unto you, I know you not." The&s;e words mu&s;t not be under&s;tood literally; for whatever Arians and Socinians may &s;ay to the contrary, yet
<PB N="315" REF="028079_0313_0FD696145723A520">
we affirm, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is God, God ble&s;&s;ed for ever, and therefore knoweth all things. He &s;aw Nathaniel, when under the fig-tree. He &s;ees and is now looking down from heaven, his dwelling-place, upon us, to &s;ee how we behave in the&s;e fields. Brethren, I know nothing of the thoughts and in|tents of your hearts, in coming hither; but Je&s;us knows who come like new-born babes, de&s;irous to be fed with the &s;incere milk of the word; and he knows who come to hear what the babbler &s;ays, and to run away with part of a broken &s;entence, that they may have whereof they may ridicule or accu&s;e him. This expre&s;&s;ion then, "I know you not," mu&s;t not be under&s;tood literally; no, it implies a knowledge of approbation, as though Chri&s;t had &s;aid, <Q>You call me Lord, Lord, but you have not done the things that I have &s;aid;</Q> you de&s;ire me to open the door, but how can you come in hither not having on a wedding garment? Alas, you are na|ked! Where is my outward righteou&s;ne&s;s imputed to you? Where is my inherent righteou&s;ne&s;s wrought in you? Where is my divine image &s;tamped upon your &s;ouls? How dare you call me Lord, Lord, when you have not received the Holy Gho&s;t, whereby I real all that are truly mine? <Q>Verily, I know you not; depart from me, ye cur&s;ed, into everla&s;ting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.</Q></P>
<P>And now, <Q>he that hath ears to hear, let him hear</Q> what manner of per&s;ons the&s;e were, whom Je&s;us Chri&s;t di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with this an&s;wer. Remem|ber, I intreat you, they are not &s;ent away for being fornicators, &s;wearers, &s;abbath-breakers, or prodi|gals. No, in all probability, they were, touching the outward ob&s;ervances of the moral law, blame|le&s;s; they were con&s;tant as to the form of religion; and if they did no good yet no one could &s;ay they
<PB N="316" REF="028079_0314_0FD695F2C9BB5928">
did any harm. The only thing for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> they were condemned, and eternally bani&s;hed from the pre|&s;ence of the Lord (for &s;o much is implied in <Q>I know you not</Q>) was this, they had no oil in their lamps, no principle of a true living faith and holine&s;s in their hearts. And if per&s;ons may go to church, receive the &s;acrament, lead hone&s;t moral lives, and yet be &s;ent to hell at the la&s;t day, as they certainly will be if they advance no farther, where wilt thou, O drunkard? Where wilt thou, O &s;wearer? Where wilt thou, O &s;abbath-breaker? Where wilt thou that denie&s;t divine revelation, and even the form of godline&s;s? Where will you and &s;uch like &s;inners appear? I know very well. You mu&s;t appear before the dreadful tribunal of Je&s;us Chri&s;t: However you may, like Felix, put off the pro&s;ecution of your convictions, yet you, as well as others, mu&s;t ari&s;e after death, and appear in judg|ment; you will then find, to your eternal &s;orrow, that your damnation &s;lumbers not: &s;in has blinded your hearts and hardened your foreheads now, but yet a little while, and our Lord will ea&s;e him of his adver&s;aries. Methinks, by faith, I &s;ee the heavens opened, and the holy Je&s;us coming with his face brighter than ten thou&s;and &s;uns, darting fury upon you from his eyes! Methinks I &s;ee you ri&s;ing from your graves, trembling, a&s;toni&s;hed, and crying out, who can abide this day of his coming!</P>
<P>And now what inference &s;hall I draw from what has been &s;aid? Our Lord, in the text, has drawn one for me: <Q>Watch therefore, for ye know nei|ther the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.</Q></P>
<P>Watch, that is, be on your guard, and keep your graces in continual exerci&s;e; For, as when we are commanded to watch unto prayer, it &s;ignifies that
<PB N="317" REF="028079_0315_0FD69615CBD294B0">
we &s;hould continue in&s;tant in that duty; &s;o when we are required to watch in general, it means that we &s;hould put on the whole armour of God, and live every day as though it were our la&s;t.</P>
<P>And O that the Lord may now enable me to lift up my voice like a trumpet! for had I a thou&s;and tongues, or could I &s;peak &s;o loud that the whole world might hear me, I could not &s;ound a more u&s;eful alarm than that which is contained in the text. Watch, therefore, my brethren, I be&s;eech you by the mercies of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, Watch; be on your guard; <Q>Awake, ye that &s;leep in the du&s;t; for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man com|eth.</Q> Perhaps to day, perhaps this midnight, this cry may be made: for in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, the trump is to &s;ound. How|ever, &s;uppo&s;ing the final day of judgment may yet be a great way off, the day of death is certainly near at hand. For what is our life? It is but a vapour, &s;oon pa&s;&s;eth it away, and we are gone. Ble&s;&s;ed be God, we are all here well; but who, out of this great multitude, dare &s;ay, I &s;hall go home to my hou&s;e in &s;afety! Who knows, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> whil&s;t I am &s;peaking God may commi&s;&s;ion his mini&s;tering &s;pi|rits to call &s;ome of you away by a &s;udden &s;troke, to give an account with what attention you have heard this &s;ermon.</P>
<P>You know, my brethren, &s;ome &s;uch in&s;tances we have lately had. And what angel or &s;pirit has a&s;|&s;ured us, that &s;ome of you &s;hall not be the next? <Q>Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man will come:</Q> And it is chiefly for this rea&s;on, that God has hid the day of our deaths from us.

<P>Many &s;uch reflections as the&s;e, my brethren, croud in on my mind. At pre&s;ent, ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, who delights to magnify his &s;trength in a poor worm's weakne&s;s, I am at a &s;tand, not &s;o much about what I &s;hall &s;ay, as what I &s;hall leave un|&s;aid. My belly, like Elihu's, is, as it were, full of new wines; out of the abundance of my heart, my mouth &s;peaketh. A &s;en&s;e of the infinite maje&s;|ty of that God in who&s;e name I preach, and before whom I as well as you mu&s;t appear, to give an ac|count; and the uncertainty there is whether I &s;hall live another day, to &s;peak to you any more, are con&s;iderations, which furni&s;h me with &s;o much mat|ter, that I &s;carce know where to begin, or end my application. However, for method's &s;ake, by the divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I will branch it into three parti|culars.</P>
<P>And <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I would remind you, that are notori|ou&s;ly ungodly, of what our Lord &s;ays in the text: for, tho' I have &s;aid your damnation &s;lumbers not, whil&s;t you continue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> an impenitent &s;tate; yet that was only to &s;et you on your watch, to convince you of your danger, and excite you to cry out: <Q>What &s;hall we do to be &s;aved?</Q> I appeal to all that hear me, whether I have &s;aid the door of mercy &s;hould be &s;hut again&s;t you, if you believe on Je&s;us Chri&s;t: No, if you are the chief of &s;inners; if you are murderers of fathers, or of mothers; if you are emphatically the dung and offscouring of all things; yet if you believe on Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and cry unto him with the &s;ame faith as the expiring thief, <Q>Lord, remember me, now thou art in thy kingdom;</Q> I will pawn my eternal &s;alvation on it, that he will
<PB N="319" REF="028079_0317_0FD696198E0E1D30">
&s;hortly tran&s;late you to his heavenly paradi&s;e. Won|der not at my &s;peaking with &s;o much a&s;&s;urance, for I know <Q>It is a faithful and true &s;aying, and wor|thy of all acceptation, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t came into the world to &s;ave (all truly affected and be|lieving) &s;inners:</Q> Nay, &s;o great is his love, that I am per&s;uaded, was it nece&s;&s;ary, he would come again into the world, and die a &s;econd time for them on the cro&s;s. But, ble&s;&s;ed be God, when our Lord bowed down his head, and gave up the gho&s;t, our redemption was fini&s;hed. It is not our &s;ins, but our want of a lively faith in his blood, that will prove our condemnation: If you draw near to him by faith, tho' you are the wor&s;t of &s;inners, yet he will not &s;ay unto you, <Q>Verily I know you not.</Q> No, a door of mercy &s;hall be opened to you. Look then, by an eye of faith, to that God man, whom ye have pierced. Behold him bleed|ing, panting, dying on the cro&s;s, with arms &s;tretch|ed out ready to embrace you all. Hark! how he groans! See how all nature is in agony! The rocks rend, the graves open; the &s;un withdraws its light, a&s;hamed as it were to &s;ee the God of nature &s;uffer; and all this to u&s;her in man's great redemption. Nay, the holy Je&s;us, in the bitter agonies and pangs of death, prays for his very murderers: Fa|ther, forgive them, for they know not what they do. If then you have crucified the Son of God afre&s;h, and put him to an open &s;hame, yet do not de&s;pair, only believe, and even this &s;hall be for|given. You have read, at lea&s;t you have heard, no doubt, how three thou&s;and were converted at Peter's preaching one &s;ermon, after our Lord's a&s;cen&s;ion, and many of the crucifiers of the Lord of glory undoubtedly were among them; and why &s;hould you de&s;pair? For Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the &s;ame
<PB N="320" REF="028079_0318_0FD695F647DABA18">
ye&s;terday, to-day, and for ever. The Holy Gho&s;t &s;hall be &s;ent down on you, as well as on them, if you do but believe; for Chri&s;t a&s;cended up on high to receive this gift even for the vile&s;t of men. Come then, all ye that are weary and heavy laden with a &s;en&s;e of your &s;ins, lay hold on Chri&s;t by faith and he will give you re&s;t; for &s;alvation is the free gift of God to all them that believe. And though you may think this too good news to be true, yet I &s;peak the truth in Chri&s;t, I lie not, this is the go&s;|pel, this is the glad tidings which we are commi&s;|&s;ioned to preach to every one. Be not faithle&s;s then, but believing. Let not the devil lead you captive at his will any longer; for all the wages he gives his &s;ervants in death, death often in this life, death everla&s;ting in the next: but the free gift of God is everla&s;ting life to all that believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Phari&s;ees are and will be offended at my coming here, and offering your &s;alvation on &s;uch cheap terms: but the more they bid me hold my peace, the more will I cry out and proclaim to convicted &s;inners, that Je&s;us, David's &s;on according to the fle&s;h, but David's Lord as he was God, will have mercy on all that by a living faith truly turn to him. If this is to be vile, I pray God I may be more vile. If they will not let me preach Chri&s;t crucified; and offer &s;alvation to &s;inners in a church, I will preach him in the lanes, &s;treets, highways and hedges; and nothing plea&s;es me better, than to think I am now in one of the devil's &s;tronge&s;t holds. Surely the Lord has not &s;ent me and all you hither for nothing; no, ble&s;&s;ed be God, <Q>the fields are white, ready unto harve&s;t,</Q> and many &s;ouls I hope will be gathered into his heavenly gar|ner. It is true, It is the midnight of the church, e&s;pecially the poor church of England; but God
<PB N="321" REF="028079_0319_0FD6961B112125A8">
has lately &s;ent forth his &s;ervants to cry, <Q>Behold the bridegroom cometh:</Q> I be&s;eech you, O &s;in|ners, hearken unto the voice! Let me e&s;pou&s;e you by faith to my dear ma&s;ter: and henceforward watch and pray, that you mad be ready to go forth to meet him.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I would apply to tho&s;e that are not open|ly profane, but by depending on a formal round of duties, deceive your &s;ouls, and are fooli&s;h virgins.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t &s;peak to your conviction, rather than comfort. My dear brethren, you have heard how far the fooli&s;h virgins went, and yet were an&s;wered with, "Verily I know you no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">:" The rea&s;on is, becau&s;e none but &s;uch as have a living faith in Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, and are truly born again, can po&s;&s;ibly enter into the kingdom of heaven. You may, per|haps, live hone&s;t and outwardly moral lives, but if you depend on that morality, or join your works with your faith, in order to ju&s;tify you before God, you have no lot or &s;hare in Chri&s;t's redemption: For what is this but to deny the Lord that has bought you? What is this but making your&s;elves your own Saviour? taking the crown from Chri&s;t, and putting it on your own heads? The crime of the devil, &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed, con&s;i&s;ted in this, that he would not bow to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, when the Father commanded all the angels to wor&s;hip him: and what do you le&s;s? You will not own and &s;ubmit to his righteou&s;ne&s;s; and though you pretend to wor&s;hip him with your lips, yet your hearts are far from him; be&s;ides you, in effect, deny the opera|tions of his ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, you mi&s;take common for effectual grace; you hope to be &s;aved becau&s;e you have good de&s;ires, and a few &s;hort convictions; and what is this, but to give God, his word, and all his &s;aints, the lie? A Jew, a Turk, has equally
<PB N="322" REF="028079_0320_0FD695FA0CB8AB08">
as good grounds whereon to build the hopes of his &s;alvation. Need I not then to cry out to you, ye fooli&s;h virgins, watch. Beg of God to convince you of your &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s, and the unbelief of your hearts; or otherwi&s;e when the cry &s;hall be made, "Behold the bridegroom cometh," you will find your&s;elves utterly unprepared to go forth to meet him: You may cry, Lord, Lord, but the an&s;wer will be, Verily I know you not.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> I would &s;peak a word to you by way of exhortation to tho&s;e who are wi&s;e virgins and are a&s;&s;ured they have on a wedding-garment. That there are many &s;uch among&s;t you, who by grace have renounced your own righteou&s;ne&s;s, and know that the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Lord Je&s;us is imputed to you, I make no doubt. God has his &s;ecret ones in the wor&s;t of times; and I am per&s;uaded he has not let &s;o loud a go&s;pel-cry be made among his people, as of late has been heard, for nothing. No, I am confident, the Holy Gho&s;t has been given to many at the preaching of faith, and has power|fully fallen on many, whil&s;t they have been hearing the word. You are now then no longer fooli&s;h, but wi&s;e virgins; notwith&s;tanding, I be&s;eech you al&s;o to &s;uffer the word of exhortation; for wi&s;e vir|gins are too apt, whil&s;t the bridegroom tarries, to &s;lumber and &s;leep. Watch therefore, watch and pray, at this time e&s;pecially; for perhaps a time of &s;uffering is at hand. The ark of the Lord begins already to be driven into the wilderne&s;s. Be ye therefore on your watch, and &s;till per&s;evere in fol|lowing your Lord, even without the camp, bearing his reproach: the cry that has been lately made; has awakened the devil and his &s;ervants; they be|gin to rage horribly: and well they may; for I hope their kingdom is in danger. Watch there|fore,
<PB N="323" REF="028079_0321_0FD6961CB9172878">
for if we are not always on our guard, a time of trial may overtake us unawares; and, in&s;tead of owning, like Peter we may be tempted to deny our ma&s;ter. Set death and eternity often before you. Look to Je&s;us, the author and fini&s;her of your faith, and con&s;ider how little a while it will be, ere he comes to judgment; and then our reproach &s;hall be wiped away; the accu&s;ers of us and our brethren &s;hall be ca&s;t down, and we all &s;hall be lodged in heaven for ever, with our dear Lord.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> What I &s;ay to you, I &s;ay to all, Watch: High and low, rich and poor, young and old, one with another, of whatever &s;ect or denomination, for I regard not that, I be&s;eech you, by the mercies of Je&s;us, to be on your guard: Fly to Je&s;us Chri&s;t that heavenly bridegroom; Behold he de&s;ires to take you to him&s;elf, mi&s;erable, poor, blind and naked as you are; he is willing to clothe you with his everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s, and make you parta|kers of that glory, which he enjoyed with the Fa|ther before the world began. Do not turn a deaf ear to me; do not reject the me&s;&s;age on account of the meanne&s;s of the me&s;&s;enger. I am a child; but the Lord has cho&s;en me, that the glory might be all his own. Had he &s;ent to invite you by a learned rabbi, you might have &s;uppo&s;ed that the man had done &s;omething; but now God has &s;ent a child, that the excellency of the power may be &s;een not to be of man, but of God. Let the learned Pha|ri&s;ees then de&s;pi&s;e my youth: I care not how vile I appear in the &s;ight of &s;uch men; I glory in it. And I am per&s;uaded, if any of you &s;hould be mar|ried to Chri&s;t by this preaching, you will have no rea&s;on to repent, when you come to heaven, that God &s;ent a child to cry, <Q>Behold the Bridegroom cometh!</Q> O my brethren, the thought of being
<PB N="324" REF="028079_0322_0FD695FB8B51F300">
in&s;trumental in bringing one of you to glory, fills me with fre&s;h zeal. Once more, I entreat you, Watch, and pray; for the Lord Je&s;us will receive all that call on him faithfully. Let that cry, "Behold the Bridegroom cometh," be continually &s;ounding in your ears; and begin now to live, as though you were a&s;&s;ured, this night you were to go forth to meet him. May the Lord give you all an hearing ear, an obedient heart, and &s;o clo&s;ely unite you to him&s;elf by one &s;pirit, that when he &s;hall come in terrible maje&s;ty, to judge mankind, you may be found having on a wedding-garment, and ready to go in with him to the marriage.</P>
<P><HI>Grant this, O Father, for thy dear Son's &s;ake, Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord. Amen! and Amen!</HI></P>
