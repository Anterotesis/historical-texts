</EPIGRAPH>
<P>REHOBOAM, who&s;e Hi&s;tory we have in this, and the two preceding Chapters, was a weak and impoli|tick Prince; he came to the Throne with a Mind imbued with arbitrary and tyran|nical Notions and Principles of Government, received from his young and unexperienced Coun&s;ellors, to the Rejection of the good and &s;olid Advice given him by the grave Senators, who had been long ver&s;ed in the Art of Go|vernment, and were well acquainted with the whol&s;om Maxims of Policy: And he &s;tands upon Record with the blemi&s;hed Character of one, <HI>who did evil becau&s;e he prepared not his heart to &s;eek the LORD,</HI> ver. 14.</P>
<P>By his ill Government, and his other impi|ous Practices, he bro't many Calamities upon his People, both as the natural and moral Ef|fect thereof, and the ju&s;t Judgment of Heaven.
<PB N="2" REF="005975_0005_10271C64037A8C78">
I &s;hall not enlarge upon his Hi&s;tory or Cha|racter, but only take Notice that as a Puni&s;h|ment of his Sins, and the Sins of his People (<HI>becau&s;e they had tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed again&s;t the LORD,</HI> v.2) the King of <HI>Egypt</HI> came up again&s;t <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and reduced them to great Di&s;tre&s;s; which together with the Reproof of the Prophet SHEMAIAH, brought them in &s;ome mea&s;ure to a Sen&s;e of their Sins and made them humble them&s;elves before GOD; which very much turned the Cour&s;e of things; <HI>the Wrath of the LORD turned from him that he would not de&s;troy him altogether.</HI> GOD promi&s;ed likewi&s;e <HI>that he would not de&s;troy this People, but grant them &s;ome Delive|rance, and that his wrath &s;hould on be poured out upon Jeru&s;alem by the hand of</HI> SHISHAK, v.7.</P>
<P>NOW it was at this Juncture, that the Sa|cred Hi&s;tory informs us, <HI>And al&s;o in Judah things went well.</HI> The&s;e are the words which I have cho&s;en for my Text at this Time, and may, I think, be a proper Introduction to a Di&s;cour&s;e on the <HI>Welfare</HI> of a Government in general. And though I am not Studied in the Rules of Government or the civil and religious Rights of a People, &s;o as to treat this great &amp; weighty Subject, with that Clearne&s;s that it de&s;erves, (alas! I find my &s;elf very unequal to the Ta&s;k) yet &s;ince Providence has called me to Speak be|fore this honourable Auditory, I &s;hall attempt the Subject, as the mo&s;t proper, I could think of
<PB N="3" REF="005975_0006_10271C6598CF41E0">
upon this Occa&s;ion; <HI>And al&s;o in Judah things went well.</HI></P>
<P>THE Method I propo&s;e is this, viz.</P>
<P N="1">I. TO con&s;ider when things may be &s;aid to go well with a People; or, attempt to &s;hew in &s;eve|ral In&s;tances wherein the Welfare of a Govern|ment con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P N="2">II. APPLY the whole to the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P N="1">1. &s;hall con&s;ider when things may be &s;aid to go well with a People; or attempt to &s;hew in &s;everal In&s;tances wherein the Welfare of a Government con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not confine my &s;elf to tho&s;e particular In&s;tances mentioned in this Chapter, as the Rea|&s;on or Cau&s;e <HI>of things going well in Judah</HI> at that Time; but con&s;ider the Matter more at large, and endeavour by divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance, to trace out the Cau&s;es and Rea&s;ons of the Happine&s;s &amp; <HI>Welfare</HI> of a Government, from the <HI>Scripture</HI> Account in General, from the <HI>Na|ture</HI> and <HI>Dependance</HI> of things, and the <HI>Cir|cum&s;tances</HI> of Mankind.</P>
<P N="1">1. ONE <HI>thing that has a mighty Influence, to the Welfare of a People or Government, is the, flouri&s;hing of RELIGION.</HI> As far as Igno|rance,
<PB N="4" REF="005975_0007_10271C684FA04E20">
Prophanene&s;s and Immortality prevail in a Nation or Country, &s;o far are they, remo|ved from Happine&s;s, and &s;o far are they wret|ched, &amp; mi&s;erable, &amp; poor, &amp; blind, &amp; naked. '<HI>Tis Righteou&s;ne&s;s that exalteth a Nation, but Sin is a Reproach to any People,</HI> Prov. 14.34. 'Tis a Reproach that can never be wip'd off, but by GOD's forgiving Grace, which attends true Repentance, and an effectual thorough Reformation.</P>
<P>'TIS then that the almighty GOD returns to a People that had departed from him, &s;cat|ters impending Calamities, delights to do them good, engages his Kind, Allpowerful and Allwi&s;e Providence for their Defence, their Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s and Glory; and in a word, keeps them as the <HI>Apple of His Eye.</HI></P>
<P>SIN has a natural Tendency to depre&s;s and keep a People low, be&s;ides the terrible Judg|ments of Heaven which by GOD's po&s;itve Appointment are entail'd to it. And Piety and Vertue, Faith unfeigned, and true Holi|ne&s;s have a native Tendency to pomote the true Inter&s;ts of a People, and moreover to engage the Favour of the ble&s;&s;ed GOD to them, and render them meet for a &s;tore of Su|pernumerary Ble&s;&s;ings. If we did but know and con&s;ider the infinite Plagues and extreme Cur&s;es, temporal and &s;piritual to a Per&s;on or People, to a Nation or Land, that are wrapt

up in the Bowels of Sin, we &s;hould fly from it as from Hell, and never re&s;t impenitent, nor cea&s;e begging and pleading at the Throne of Grace, till we had obtained Forgivene&s;s thro' the Blood of the Redeemer: And if we did but duly con&s;ider the true Worth &amp; Excellence of Religion, and the innumerable Ble&s;&s;ings con|tained in it, both publick and private both for Time and Eternity, we could not but be ena|moured of &s;o much Beauty and Loveline&s;s, we could not but with the greate&s;t Earne&s;tne&s;s &s;eek to be po&s;&s;e&s;t of a Pearl of &s;uch ine&s;tima|ble Value, we could not cea&s;e <HI>crying after Know|lege, and lifting up our Voice for Under&s;tanding until GOD &s;hall come and rain down Righteou&s;|ne&s;s upon us, and make us an holy People.</HI> Who|ever therefore con&s;iders the proper &amp; genuine Influence of Religion, to the making Men tem|perate and pure, &s;incere and upright, patient and forgiving, kind and charitable, meek and humble, pious &amp; devout, and in a word happy them&s;elves and Ble&s;&s;ings to one another, mu&s;t acknowlege the Truth of this great Doctrine, that the Welfare of a People or Government, con&s;i&s;ts very much in the flouri&s;hing of Reli|gion. And whoever con&s;iders likewi&s;e the many additional Ble&s;&s;ings of Heaven, which commonly attend a People when Religion flouri&s;hes mu&s;t confe&s;s it a Confirmation of this Truth.</P>

Publick Vertue is atten|ded with publick Ble&s;&s;ings. The Rea&s;ons of it are very apparent, but the Time will not admit, that I mention them. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve in ge|neral that the <HI>Scriptures</HI> abound with the Proof of it, and the Rea&s;ons there alledged are not &s;uch as to be confined to the legal Di&s;pen&s;ation.</P>
<P>RELIGION then we may look upon as the Foundation and Corner Stone of the Welfare of a People or Government; tis this that en|gages GOD for them and brings them to par|take take in his Love and Friend&s;hip, which is comprehen&s;ive of all Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s and Glory; and this is what has a direct, and immediate Influence on all other of the Cau&s;es &amp; Rea&s;ons of a Peoples Welfare: and I have in&s;i&s;ted the longer upon it, becau&s;e it is a Matter of migh|ty and everla&s;ting Importance.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>GOOD RULERS, &amp; good LAWS well execu|ted are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the Welfare of a Government. By good Rulers</HI> I mean &s;uch as are truly religious wi&s;e and faithful, who are acquainted with the true Intere&s;ts of their People, and are zealous bold and re&s;olute, in

pro&s;ecuting this great End and Purpo&s;e; in a Word, who according to the magnificent Lan|guage of the Scripture, are <HI>as the Light of the morning when the Sun ri&s;eth even a morning without Clouds, as the tender Gra&s;s &s;pringing out of the Earth by clear &s;hining after Rain,</HI> 2 Sam 23.4. <HI>By good Laws,</HI> I mean &s;uch as are wi&s;e|ly contrived to &s;ecure the Subject in his ju&s;t Rights; to repre&s;s, and re&s;train the exorbitant Practices of the lewd and licentious; in a word &s;uch as breathe forth Terror to evil Doers, and Prai&s;e &amp; Encouragement to them that do well.</P>
<P>WHICH, after all the Wi&s;dom &amp; Care of the <HI>Legis&s;lator,</HI> if they ly by unexecuted, &s;erve to no purpo&s;e but empty Pomp, and Pagean|try. What &s;ignifies Laws to &s;uppre&s; Immo|rality, if thro' Neglect of Execution, People may with Impunity go on openly in their vici|ous &amp; immoral Cour&s;es? What &s;ignifies Laws wi&s;ely &amp; prudently adju&s;ted to maintain Ju&s;tice and Right, and &s;ecure People in their Proper|ties, if thro' Ignorance, or &s;upine Inattention, Fear or Favour, Bribery or Flattery, the Cour&s;e of Ju&s;tice is turned, and the Rights of the Peo|ple invaded by Fraud or Oppre&s;&s;ion in &s;pite of the Laws?</P>
<P>'TIS happy for a Government, 'tis an in|compatable Smile of divine Providence upon a People, to be under the Direction &amp; Guidance of <HI>Good Rulers,</HI> and the Re&s;traint &amp; Influence

of <HI>good whol&s;om Laws</HI> con&s;cientiou&s;ly Execu|ted. There is not a meer accidental &amp; ca&s;ual Dependence of the&s;e things upon one another but there is a nece&s;&s;ary and undivided Con|nexion of the one with the other. GOD denounces his heavy Wo's again&s;t bad Rulers: <HI>Wo be to the Shepherds of I&s;rael, that do feed them&s;elves, &s;hould not the Shepherds feed the flocks? Ye eat the fat and ye cloath ye with the wool, ye kill them that are fed, but ye feed not the Flock: the di&s;ea&s;ed have ye not &s;trengthned, neither have ye healed that which was &s;ick, nei|ther have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye &s;ought that which was lo&s;t; but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them,</HI> Ezek. 34.2, 3.4. And &s;uch a State of things is as full of Wo to a People, a fearful de&s;cription whereof we have in the fol|lowing <HI>Ver&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>IT was among the choice &amp; rich Ble&s;&s;ings, which GOD promi&s;ed to his People ISRAEL at their final Re&s;toration in the latter Days, that Prophet reckons good Rulers, <HI>I will make thy Officers peace and thine exactors Righteou&s;|ne&s;s</HI> and as the genuine Con&s;equence thereof he adds, <HI>Violence &s;hall be no more heard in thy Land, wa&s;ting nor de&s;truction within thy Bor|ders; but thou &s;halt call thy Walls Salvation and thy Gates Prai&s;e,</HI> I&s;a, 16, 17, 18.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="005975_0012_10271C7571EE68E0">WHEN we con&s;ider what a mighty Influ|ence <HI>good Rulers</HI> and <HI>good Laws</HI> have to put a &s;top to the de&s;tructive outrages of Vice; to promote Godline&s;s and Vertue; to pre&s;erve Peace and good Order; to maintain Righteou&s;|ne&s;s and Truth; and how they are, under GOD, the Defence and Glory of a Land, we mu&s;t conclude, that next to the Influences of the ble&s;&s;ed Go&s;pel &amp; Grace of JESUS CHRIST, they are the chief and principal Means of mi|ni&s;tring to the <HI>welfare</HI> &amp; Happine&s;s of a Peo|ple: They are the ine&s;timable Ble&s;&s;ings which GOD &s;ends to a People whom he delights to ble&s;s. They are Ble&s;&s;ings comprehen&s;ive of many others, more than we can reckon up, and of higher Importance than we can ea&s;ily con|ceive.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>LOYALTY in a People towards their Ru|lers makes a nece&s;&s;ary Part of the Welfare of a Government.</HI> When Rulers in the Di&s;charge of their high and important Tru&s;t, are &s;triving with Heart and Head and Hand, to promote the great Ends of Rule, and Government, the Good and <HI>Welfare</HI> of their People, and are willing <HI>to &s;pend and be &s;pent,</HI> for the common Weal, what inexcu&s;able and &s;hameful Ingrati|tude to GOD, as well as Blindne&s;s to their own Intere&s;ts, is it for a People to bite the Hand that thus kindly feeds them? to reproach, mi&s;u&s;e, and ill-treat tho&s;e whom GOD has
<PB N="10" REF="005975_0013_10271C795EF16300">
placed as guardian Angels to defend them from Evil, and promote their Good? By this Means they counter-work the gracious De&s;igns of di|vine Providence, the benevolent, and benificent Schemes of their Rulers and change Ble&s;&s;ings into Cur&s;es. GOD is graciou&s;ly &s;miling upon them, by &s;ending them wi&s;e &amp; faithful Rulers; their Rulers are con&s;ulting &amp; &s;triving to pro|mote their Welfare; but they undo all by their Di&s;loyalty and Di&s;obedience, their &s;peaking evil of, and their Seditions again&s;t their good Rulers, and their Government and Laws.</P>
<P>THE great &amp; aggravated Wickedne&s;s, and Ingratitude of Di&s;re&s;pect, Irreverence &amp; Di&s;o|bedience to civil Rulers, con&s;i&s;ts in its counter|acting the primary, nay the only De&s;ign of their Office and Bu&s;ine&s;s. They are appointed <HI>as Mini&s;ters of GOD to their People for good,</HI> Rom. 13.4. And &s;o long as they keep within the Limits of their Commi&s;&s;ion and the De&s;ign of their Office they can have nothing el&s;e in View, but the good and Welfare of their People. But by our Di&s;loyalty &amp; Oppo&s;ition we ca&s;t away the publick Ble&s;&s;ings, which they were heaping upon us, and with ra&s;h Hands pull down upon our&s;elves tho&s;e publick evils, which they were &s;triving to ward off. In &s;uch a Ca&s;e oppo&s;ing, re&s;i&s;ting, &amp; di&s;obeying the civil Ru|ler, is nothing le&s;s than Oppo&s;ing the Intere&s;t and Welfare of the Community, which, be&s;ide
<PB N="11" REF="005975_0014_10271C7D452C3800">
the <HI>Damnation</HI> we bring upon our&s;elves, tends as far as its Influence reaches to involve the Common-wealth in Ruin. Therefore to &s;hew all dutiful Reverence, and Re&s;pect to the Per|&s;ons of civil Rulers, to give them an honoura|ble Maintenance, to &s;ubmit to, and obey them, in the Di&s;charge of their Office, is nece&s;&s;ary, not meerly for their Honour &amp; Glory, but for the Welfare of the Government.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>A fixed &s;table MEDIUM OF TRADE, or Money &s;ettled and fixed at a certain Value is at lea&s;t highly if not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the Wel|fare of a Government.</HI> The Nece&s;&s;ity &amp; Con|venience of a <HI>Medium of Trade</HI> is very appa|rent. And that whatever is u&s;ed as a publick current <HI>medium of Trade,</HI> whether coined <HI>Metals</HI> or &s;tamped <HI>Paper,</HI> be by publick Au|thority fixed at a certain, known, and invaria|ble Value, is as nece&s;&s;ary as the thing it &s;elf.</P>
<P>THIS is the <HI>Standard,</HI> the <HI>Balance</HI> the <HI>Mea|&s;ure</HI> by which all that we trade &amp; traffick in, is as to the Value, <HI>regulated, weighed,</HI> &amp; <HI>mea&s;ured,</HI> &amp; con&s;equently if this <HI>Medium of Trade</HI> be of an uncertain changeable Value, &s;ome times higher and &s;ome times lower, it comes to pa&s;s that every thing we trade in, is regulated by a fal&s;e <HI>Rule,</HI> weighed in a fal&s;e <HI>Balance,</HI> and mea&s;ured by a fal&s;e <HI>Mea&s;ure</HI>: Such a fluctuating &s;inking <HI>medium of Trade</HI> is nothing better, and nothing can be wor&s;e, than <HI>fal&s;e Weights and fal&s;e Mea|&s;ures,

both of them are an abomination to the LORD,</HI> Prov. 2.1. and are publick heavy Grievances to a Government.</P>
<P>IF People can borrow Money and at the Time of Payment, thro' the depreciating of the Species, di&s;charge the Obligation, and keep back the <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> and a con&s;iderable Part of the <HI>Principal.</HI> If People can trade &amp; run in Debt, and at the Time of Payment, di&s;charge the Debt, and keep a <HI>fifth Part</HI> to them&s;elves: alas! what a Floodgate is opened for Oppre&s;|&s;ion, Inju&s;tice, Idlene&s;s, Profu&s;ene&s;s, and In|temperance, to the enervating Indu&s;try and Frugality, to the Ruin of our Trade, Manu|factures &amp; Hu&s;bandry, to the debauching our Morals, and to the inflaming the Anger of al|mighty GOD again&s;t our Land.

<P>WHETHER we con&s;ider the Matter in a <HI>politick,</HI> or <HI>moral</HI> View, that is, either in Rela|tion to the civil Intere&s;ts of a Government, or the Morality of the People, the A&s;pect is all formidably threatning.

Weights and divers Mea&s;ures,</HI> many indu&s;trious Families coming to Poverty by this Means, and every Branch of <HI>Trade</HI> and <HI>Commerce</HI> langui&s;h|ing, be&s;ide the beholding Pride, Prodigality, Fraud and Exce&s;s riding triumphant, thro' means of this Temptation laid before the Peo|ople? in &s;uch a Po&s;ture of affairs a Government &s;tands upon the Brink of a fatal Precipice and (unle&s;s &s;ome kind Hand prevent) will &s;oon fall.</P>
<P>EVERY one that con&s;iders the Matter im|partially, will doubtle&s;s acknowlege that this is no unju&s;t Exaggeration of the deplorable Con&s;e|quences of the Ca&s;e that I have put. And if this be the true State of the Matter, none can doubt but a <HI>fixed &s;table Medium of Exchange</HI> is nece&s;&s;ary to the <HI>Welfare</HI> of a Government. This will be of great Influence to reduce every one to live upon his own, (that is to &s;ay ho|ne&s;tly) and will nece&s;&s;arily us to In|du&s;try, and Prudence, Thriftine&s;s, and Fruga|lity it will take the Advantage out of the Hands of <HI>Cheats</HI> and <HI>Sharpers,</HI> and nece&s;&s;itate them to &s;ome hone&s;t Way of Living, it will Make People cautious of running in Debt, and prevent numberle&s;s Law Suits; but Time would fail to enumerate all, therefore in one Word it would be an excellent In&s;trument of promoting the Pro&s;perity and encouraging the Vertue of a People of Government.</P>

<P>LET us remember that by the Doctrins we preach, and the exemplary Lives we &s;hould live, we are to be <HI>the Salt of the Earth and Lights to the World.</HI> Of what great Importance is it that we preach found Doctrin, and recommend it by Solid Arguments, and make it appear that we are in good Earne&s;t, by living our &s;elves, ac|cording to the Doctrine we preach to others? There is nothing more &s;candalous than a Mini|&s;ter of a loo&s;e, vicious Life, nor any thing more for the Honour of Religion, than found Doctrin and a good Life in &s;uch who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s it is to teach &amp; recommend Religion to others. How much may we do to di&s;&s;wade Men from Vice, and per&s;wade them to Religion by &s;etting forth the Excellency of the Go&s;pel of JESUS CHRIST; by placing the Doctrines, Precepts, Promi&s;es and Threatnings of Chri&s;tianity in their true Light, and by making it appear in our whole Conduct that we act under the Influence of the&s;e things our &s;elves? This will be of excel|lent Tendency to promote Faith &amp; Piety, Truth and Vertue among our People. The&s;e I know are common Topics; but they can never be made too familiar by frequent Repetitions.</P>
<P>MOREOVER we may do much, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD, to the encouraging the Hearts
<PB N="28" REF="005975_0031_10271CABE9AF9D98">
and &s;trengthning the Hands of our honourable civil Rulers, by teaching, and inculcating upon our People their great obligations to yield Ho|nour, Re&s;pect and Reverence to their Per&s;ons, and all Loyalty, Submi&s;&s;ion and Obedience to their whol&s;om Laws and wi&s;e Government. A Di&s;loyal &s;editious Mini&s;ter may do much to the &s;preading the pernicious Seeds of Di&s;loyalty and Sedition among the People; and one who is a good Subject him&s;elf may do much to the making his People of that Temper and Cha|racter: Therefore if we de&s;ire, according to our &s;olemn Obligations, to contribute <HI>to things go|ing well in our Land,</HI> let us &s;hew our&s;elves loyal Subjects, and pre&s;s and urge Loyalty upon our People.</P>
<P>FURTHERMORE in as much as we are in a peculiar Sen&s;e Pa&s;tors and Mini&s;ters of the Church of CHRIST, I would humbly propo&s;e one thing more to your Con&s;ideration, which I can but look upon as a Matter of great Impor|tance to the publick Weal. The Con&s;titution of the Churches in this Government is, by the Smiles of divine Providence on the pious Care of our fore Fathers, without Controver&s;y ex|cellently calculated and &s;ettled; there is a wi&s;e Provi&s;ion made that particular Churches may mutually help each other, by the frequent Con|vention of Councils made up of the Elders and Me&s;&s;engers, of the Churches, in each particular
<PB N="29" REF="005975_0032_10271CAD8A7DD638">
County: but then I would humbly propo&s;e whether this Help and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Churches to each other would not be more exten&s;ive and beneficial, provided there was a general Coun|cil made up of Elders &amp; Me&s;&s;engers from each County in the Government, and thereby our general annual A&s;&s;ociation turned into a gene|ral annual Con&s;ociation or Council? this would be a Bond to unite and cement the whole, and would put the Churches of each particular County, under Advantage of affording, that Help and A&s;&s;i&s;tance to each other, which by their being now &s;o much independent of one another, they are in great Mea&s;ure incapable of. Time will not admit, that I enlarge upon the Subject, therefore I would only &s;ay, that if &s;uch a thing was put on Foot and we could have the Countenance of our honourable civil <HI>Le|gi&s;lature</HI> it might be very conducive to things going well in this Government.</P>
<P>AND as we tender the welfare of this Go|vernment, &amp; the Churches of CHRIST and as we would be faithful to the Souls of our People, it &s;tands us in Hand unitedly to endeavour, as far as our Influence reaches, to heal tho&s;e Di|vi&s;ions that are among us; and to &s;tand up for the Peace &amp; Order of the Churches of CHRIST, by not &s;uffering our &s;elves to be prevailed upon by any &s;pecious, plau&s;ible Pretences what&s;oever to give Countenance or Encouragement to tho&s;e

<P>FINALLY in order that we may be exten|&s;ive Ble&s;&s;ings, in the Places in which we live tis nece&s;&s;ary that we be much in Prayer, and very fructious in the &s;acred Scriptures; that we be earne&s;t in our Prayers for our civil Rulers and the People they govern. We &s;hould be in&s;tant in Prayer that we may have &s;uch Rulers as &s;hall <HI>be Mini&s;ters of GOD unto us for good</HI>; and that under their Government <HI>we may lead quiet and peaceable Lives in all Godline&s;s &amp; Hone&s;tly. This is good and acceptable in the &s;ight of GOD our Saviour,</HI> and has an happy Tendency to make things go well.</P>
<P>AND that we may &s;ee our Duty to GOD and Man laid before us in the mo&s;t plain &amp; amiable Light, and pre&s;&s;ed upon us by the mo&s;t win|ning, powerful Arguments tis of great Impor|tance that we bend our Thoughts unweariedly to the &s;tudy of <HI>&s;acred Writ.</HI> There is nothing will fill the Mind with greater Plea&s;ure, or qua|lify us better <HI>to do good</HI> in our Calling, than an exact and accurate Knowlege of <HI>the holy Scrip|tures:</HI> And if a great Part of our Time was &s;pent in &s;tudying into the true &amp; original Sen&s;e of the <HI>Scripture,</HI> as to particlar Texts, and Phra&s;es, and the general Run of the &s;everal <HI>Books,</HI> its Connexion together, and that general

Scheme of Religion taught therein, without any Prejudice to Sects &amp; Parties, to the Authority of Men or human <HI>Analogies of Faith,</HI> we &s;hould find it of mo&s;t excellent U&s;efulne&s;s to engage our Minds to GOD and Religion, and to ani|mate our Zeal <HI>to do good,</HI> furni&s;h us with Arguments to recommend Religion to others: There is nothing will di&s;countenance Vice and Error &s;o much as the genuine Doctrines of the Go&s;pel placed in their true Light. There is no Doubt but Infidelity on the one Hand, and Enthu&s;ia&s;m on the other, and Vice which is the natural Fruit of both, proceed from Ignorance of divine Revelation. Could the Infidel be brought to under&s;tand the BIBLE in its true Sen&s;e he mu&s;t be forced to reverence that which he now ridicules. Could the Enthu&s;ia&s;t but have his Eyes opened to &s;ee the true Mean|ing of the Scriptures, it would nece&s;&s;arily reduce him to a &s;ober Mind; and could the vicious Impenitent be brought to read with Attention and under&s;tand as he reads he would behold Vice branded with &s;uch black &amp; odius Cha|racters, and Vertue &s;hining in &s;uch amiable Lu&s;tre and inviting him with &s;uch engaging, captivating Charms, that he mu&s;t if he acted like a rea&s;onable Creature, abhor the one, and be enamour'd of the other, and in the Event ca&s;t him&s;elf into the Hands of JESUS to ob|tain Grace to Pardon and renew him to Holi|ne&s;s.
<PB N="32" REF="005975_0035_10271CB722986260">
Therefore I would with the utmo&s;t Im|portunity be&s;eech Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel to &s;tudy the Scriptures Day &amp; Night, and &s;trive to rai&s;e in their People an high Ta&s;te &amp; Reli&s;h of them: than which nothing would make us more exten&s;ive Ble&s;&s;ings or qualify us better to do good to the People whom we &s;erve, by di|recting them in the Ways of Truth and Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, Piety &amp; Vertue; hereby we &s;hall be under the mo&s;t happy Advantage of in&s;truct|ing and influencing them by the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t effectual Motives <HI>to fear GOD and Honour the King,</HI> and yeild all dutiful Submi&s;&s;ion and Loyalty to &s;ubordinate civil Rulers, to the Glory of the great GOD, to the Peace &amp; Hap|pine&s;s of the Common-wealth, to the flouri&s;h|ing of the Church of CHRIST and the Securing for them&s;elves a Ble&s;&s;ed Immortality. AMEN.</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>And la&s;tly I would briefly addre&s;s my &s;elf to this Auditory in General.</HI> And I may ven|ture to &s;ay, there is not one Per&s;on, in this great Concour&s;e from the least to the greate&s;t, but what may do &s;omthing to the making <HI>things go well</HI> in this Government. Some in|deed have a larger Sphere of Action than others, and have greater Talents and Opportunities of doing Service to GOD, and their Country: but there are none of you all, but what may contribute to the Welfare of your Country.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="005975_0036_10271CB9CE36B3D0">HEADS of Families may do much for the good of the Government, by in&s;tilling Princi|ples of Piety &amp; Sobriety, Ju&s;tice and Loyalty into the Minds of tho&s;e under their Care. Indeed good family Government is of mighty Influence to pave the Way, for an happy Go|vernment, in all civil and religious Communi|ties; therefore I would in Love and Charity be&s;eech Heads of Families to con&s;ider whether they would have their Children be &s;uch as to be a Scandal to their Hou&s;es, a Reproach to their Country, a Blemi&s;h to the Chri&s;tian Name, and at la&s;t fire Brands of Hell, or on the contrary Ble&s;&s;ings in their Generation and Heirs to an heavenly glorious Inheritance in the everla&s;ting Kingdom of CHRIST. The&s;e two things you have before you. Look upon your Children; which of them can you &s;pare for Infamy and Damnation? which of them can you willngly devote to be an Enemy to GOD, a Traytor to his Country, a Slave to his Lu&s;ts and a Subject to the Kingdom of Darkne&s;s? Oh, let the Love of a Parent determine the Matter! Will you not &s;ay they are all dear to me as my own Fle&s;h: I devoted them all to GOD in Bapti&s;m; I can &s;pare none of them, for &s;uch an infamous Life, and &s;uch a fearful dolorous End. If this be the Ca&s;e, let me by the Love of GOD, and the Love you bear to your Children, beg and intreat of you, to bring them up for GOD,
<PB N="34" REF="005975_0037_10271CBFE4CE7858">
bring them up for your Country, bring them up for Heaven, otherwi&s;e their De&s;truction will be laid to your Charge.</P>
<P>I would moreover add that Children &amp; Ser|vants may likewi&s;e prove Benefactors to their Country, by Dutifulne&s;s to their Parents and Ma&s;ters, by their Piety and Vertue, their In|du&s;try and Prudence.</P>
<P>I would likewi&s;e plead the Cau&s;e of GOD and my Country, with all of every Sort &amp; De|nomination, Bu&s;ine&s;s &amp; Employment, Students and Mechanicks, tho&s;e that are engaged in Hu&s;bandry, Trade or Navigation; you are all of you under Advantage of doing good to your Country, by fixing upon a Life of Piety and Vertue, and living in a Cour&s;e of Hone&s;ty and Integrity, Ju&s;tice, Prudence and Indu&s;try.</P>
<P>WHAT happy Times &s;hould we have if the Body of our People would unite in doing what they can <HI>to make things go well in the Land</HI>? if we &s;hould all unite in a cordial effectual Belief of the great &amp; fundamental Doctrines of Reli|gion, and the Practice of the &s;ub&s;tantial Duties of <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> in fervent Prayers to GOD and Charity to one another, and a con&s;cientious Care to be found faithful in our &s;everal Places and Callings. All dark impending Clouds would &s;oon &s;catter, <HI>the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> in greater &s;plendor and Glory <HI>would ri&s;e</HI> upon us, <HI>with Healing in his wings,</HI> Di&s;pen&s;ing Pardon to

our guilty Land, re&s;toring the divine Ble&s;&s;ings we had forfeited, and give the Angels occa&s;ion to renew their Song, <HI>Glory to GOD in the highe&s;t and on Earth peace and good will towards men.</HI></P>
<P>AND now who is there that does not think this a Prize worth contending for? who would not attempt the mo&s;t arduous Ta&s;k for &s;o great and comprehen&s;ive a Ble&s;&s;ing? But when all this may be obtained at the ea&s;y Rate of living up to the Character of Men, and rational Crea|tures, upon the rea&s;onable Terms of &s;ubmitting to the Go&s;pel of JESUS CHRIST, of Loving GOD and keeping his Commandments, of <HI>do|ing ju&s;tly, Loving mercy and walking humbly with our GOD,</HI> and finally of ob&s;erving that golden Rule, <HI>As ye would that men &s;hould do to you, do ye al&s;o to them likewi&s;e,</HI> how blind are we to our own Happine&s;s to refu&s;e it upon &s;uch Terms? may GOD make us Wi&s;e to know the things that belong to our Peace now in this our Day before they are hid from our Eyes. <HI>And now, Brethren, I commend you to GOD, and to the word of his Grace, which is able build you up, and give you an Inheritance among, all them that are Sanctified</HI>: And that you may have the Smile of GOD's Providence and the Influen|ces of his Grace continually with you <HI>GOD in infinite Mercy grant thro</HI>' JESUS CHRIST.
