<P><HI>PRIESTLEY, Paine, and other ob&s;ervers on Mr. Burke's celebrated Philippick, have been read with avidity in America, while a pamphlet of equal merit has e&s;caped the publick eye. It has happened to fall into very few hands on this &s;ide the Atlantick, therefore a repub|lication will doubtle&s;s gratify every American, who has not lo&s;t &s;ight of tho&s;e principles that actuated, and the per&s;everance that effected, the in|dependence of America.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The celebrity of the author precludes the nece&s;&s;ity of an introduction to any of her works, and the truths contained in her ob&s;ervations might be their be&s;t recommendation, even though &s;he had thought proper to prefix her name.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A people who have recently and &s;everely &s;truggled for the &s;ecurity of their rights, cannot be inattentive to the arguments that &s;upport them, however &s;ome, from the ver&s;ability of the human character, and the in|&s;tability of man, may be ready to relinqui&s;h them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Whatever convul&s;ions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> yet be occa&s;ioned by the revolution in France, it will doubtle&s;s be favourable to general liberty, and Mr. Burke may unde&s;ignedly be an in&s;trument of its promotion, by agitating que&s;tions which have for a time lain dormant in England, and have been almo&s;t forgotten, or</HI> artfully di&s;gui&s;ed, <HI>in America.</HI></P>
<P><HI>You will doubtle&s;s be plea&s;ed, without further comment from your cor|re&s;pondent, with an opportunity of republi&s;hing the ob&s;ervations of a lady in England, who has added in a letter to her friend, that "the French Revolution was very unpopular in England; that it is di&s;liked by</HI> gov|ernment, <HI>becau&s;e it would nece&s;&s;arily check the encroachments of arbitra|ry power; by the</HI> nobility <HI>and</HI> clergy, <HI>from motives of intere&s;t; and by the</HI> great body of the people, <HI>becau&s;e the National A&s;&s;embly, in their reform, had not made the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution the model of their own."</HI></P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR lord&s;hip's character as a patriot, a philo&s;opher, and the firm friend of the general rights of man, encourages me to pre&s;ent to you the following Ob&s;ervations on Mr. Burke's fa|mous Reflections on the Revolution in France. They claim no popular attention for the ornaments of &s;tile in which they are de|livered; they can attract no admiration from the fa&s;cinating charms of eloquence; they are directed, not to <HI>captivate,</HI> but to <HI>convince;</HI> and it is on the pre&s;umption that your lord&s;hip attends more to the <HI>&s;ub&s;tance</HI> and <HI>end</HI> of literary compo&s;itions, than to the <HI>art</HI> of their arrangement, which induces me to flatter my&s;elf with your approbation.</P>
<P>It is not &s;urpri&s;ing that an event, the mo&s;t <HI>important</HI> to the deare&s;t intere&s;ts of mankind, the mo&s;t <HI>&s;ingular</HI> in its nature, and the mo&s;t <HI>a&s;toni&s;hing</HI> in its means, &s;hould not only have attracted the curio&s;ity of all civilized nations, but that it &s;hould have en|gaged the pa&s;&s;ions of all <HI>reflecting</HI> men.</P>
<P>Two parties are already formed in this country, who behold the French Revolution with a very oppo&s;ite temper: To the one, it in&s;pires the &s;entiment of <HI>exultation</HI> and <HI>rapture;</HI> and to the other, <HI>indignation</HI> and <HI>&s;corn.</HI> I &s;hall not take upon me to con&s;ider what are the <HI>&s;ecret</HI> pa&s;&s;ions which have given birth to the&s;e la&s;t &s;entiments; and &s;hall content my&s;elf with ob&s;erving, that Mr. Burke has undertaken to be the oracle of this la&s;t party. The abilities of this gentleman have been fully acknowledged by the impatience with which the publick have waited for his ob&s;erva|tions; and when we con&s;ider that he has been in a manner edu|cated in the great &s;chool of Parliament, that he has a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the publick councils of the Engli&s;h nation for the greater part of his life, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e him fully competent to the ta&s;k he has un|dertaken, of cen&s;uring the politicks of our neighbour kingdom, and entering into an exact definition of tho&s;e native rights which equally attach them&s;elves to every de&s;cription of men.</P>
<P>Is there a rational ob&s;ervation, or argument, in moral exi&s;tence, which this gentleman (&s;o highly favoured by nature and circum|&s;tances for political debate) could po&s;&s;ibly have pa&s;&s;ed over, on a
<PB N="4" REF="023517_0004_0FBFC27A438C7280">
&s;ubject in which he appears &s;o greatly intere&s;ted, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> which he has taken a full lei&s;ure to con&s;ider. When we fin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">im then <HI>obliged</HI> to &s;ub&s;titute a <HI>warm</HI> and <HI>pa&s;&s;ionate declamation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> cool in|ve&s;tigation,</HI> and to addre&s;s the <HI>pa&s;&s;ions</HI> in&s;tead of the <HI>rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"></HI> of man|kind, we &s;hall be induced to give a fuller credit to our judgment and our feelings, in the view we have taken of this intere&s;ting object, and the plea&s;ure it has given us.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke &s;ets out with throwing a <HI>great deal</HI> of contemptu|ous cen&s;ure on two club &s;ocieties in London, for a very harmle&s;s exertion of natural and con&s;titutional liberty. They certainly had a right to compliment the French National A&s;&s;embly on a matter of dome&s;tick government, and to expre&s;s an <HI>approbation</HI> of their conduct, with a freedom equal to that which Mr. Burke has taken in his letter to expre&s;s his <HI>abhorrence.</HI></P>
<P>The National A&s;&s;embly of France have taken no &s;uch <HI>&s;upercili|ous &s;tate</HI> upon them, as would render &s;uch a communication of &s;entiment ridiculous or pre&s;umptuous. As the patrons of <HI>equal liberty,</HI> they have not di&s;dained the addre&s;&s;es of the <HI>meane&s;t</HI> indi|vidual; con&s;equently the Revolution Society then might ration|ally expect that their addre&s;&s;es would have met with a civil recep|tion, though not clothed with the "dignity of the whole repre|&s;entative maje&s;ty of the whole Engli&s;h nation."</P>
<P>But Mr. Burke thinks that the&s;e gentlemen have &s;o &s;trong a predilection in favour of the democratick arrangements which have taken place in France, that they have been induced to wi&s;h, if not to indulge an hope, that &s;ome very important reformations may in the proce&s;s of time al&s;o take place in this country; and the&s;e harmle&s;s operations of the mind in a <HI>few ob&s;cure</HI> individuals, (for &s;uch are the members de&s;cribed who compo&s;e the offending clubs) have produced in Mr. Burke, apprehen&s;ions no ways con|&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>high</HI> opinion he has formed of the Engli&s;h con|&s;titution, or of the <HI>&s;trong</HI> attachment which he &s;uppo&s;es all that is <HI>great</HI> and <HI>good</HI> in the nation have to it.</P>
<P>Dr. Price, who&s;e animated love for mankind and the &s;pread of general happine&s;s, moved him to expre&s;s the effu&s;ion of his patri|otick &s;entiment, in a &s;ermon preached the 4th of Nov. 1789, at the di&s;&s;enting meeting hou&s;e in the Old Jewry, is cen&s;ured by Mr. Burke in <HI>&s;evere,</HI> and even <HI>acrimonious terms.</HI> Among other parts of the very offen&s;ive matter with which he charges this &s;er|mon, the having a&s;&s;erted that the <HI>King of Great Britain owes his right to the Crown by the choice of the people,</HI> is particularly &s;elected, as worthy an hi&s;torical and argumentative confutation.</P>
<P>The liberty that was taken in the year 1688, by a convention of Lords and Commons, to depo&s;e king James the reigning &s;ov|ereign from the throne, and to ve&s;t the &s;overeignty of the realm
<PB N="5" REF="023517_0005_0FBFC27EAB0E27E0">
in his daughter Mary, and her hu&s;band the prince of Orange; and afterwards by the legi&s;lature, to pa&s;s an act to &s;ettle the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion in queen Anne and her i&s;&s;ue, and in default of the&s;e, in the heirs of king William's body, and in default of the&s;e, in the hou&s;e of Hanover, (the Prote&s;tant de&s;cendants of the hou&s;e of Stuart in the female line;) and this to the prejudice not only of king James, but of his &s;on, who had been acknowledged as the lawful heir of his throne; and al&s;o to the prejudice of the hou&s;e of Savoy, who by lineal de&s;cent were the next in regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; are indeed facts, which <HI>might warrant a plain thinking man</HI> in the opinion, that the pre&s;ent reigning family owe their &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the choice or a&s;&s;ent of the people. But, in Mr. Burke's opinion, the&s;e facts are of no weight, "becau&s;e the whole family of the Stuarts were not entirely left out of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and a native of England advanced to the throne; and becau&s;e it was declared in the act of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, that the Prote&s;tant line drawn from James the fir&s;t, was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ecurity of the realm."</P>
<P>That tho&s;e individuals of the family of the Stuarts, who had never committed any offence again&s;t the peace of the country, and who&s;e mode of faith was not injurious to its welfare, &s;hould not be &s;et a&s;ide in favour of an ab&s;olute &s;tranger to the blood, was certainly a <HI>ju&s;t mea&s;ure;</HI> and it was certainly <HI>wi&s;e</HI> to leave as <HI>few</HI> competitors to the crown as po&s;&s;ible, whether on grounds <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">und|ed in ju&s;tice, or in mere plau&s;ibility. But there was a rea&s;on &s;till more forcible for the conduct of the two Hou&s;es of Convention, and afterwards for the Parliament in their con&s;titutional capacity; and the rea&s;on is this, that <HI>without the prince of Orange, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Dutch army, there could have been no Revolution.</HI> For the Engli&s;h nation at large was &s;o little convinced of the <HI>&s;e|vere and grave nece&s;&s;ity</HI> which Mr. Burke talks of, that the people of them&s;elves would never have been rou&s;ed to have depo&s;ed king James; and they regarded all his innovations with &s;uch a <HI>con&s;ti|tutional phlegm,</HI> that had this unfortunate monarch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the qualities of <HI>firmne&s;s, per&s;everance,</HI> or <HI>patience,</HI> he mu&s;t either have been killed by the dark means of <HI>a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination,</HI> or he would have <HI>continued on the throne.</HI></P>
<P>That the friends of the Revolution knew they could not do without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of king William, is plain, by their laying a&s;ide the intention of ve&s;ting Mary <HI>&s;ingly</HI> with the &s;overeignty, on his declaring that if this event took place, he would return to Holland, and leave them to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>However &s;trongly the warm friends of freedom might wi&s;h that this ab&s;tract right of the people, of choo&s;ing their own magi&s;|trates, and depo&s;ing them for ill conduct, had been laid open to
<PB N="6" REF="023517_0006_0FBFC28060B91B10">
the publick by a formal declaration of &s;uch a right in the acts of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, this certainly was not a period of time for carrying the&s;e wi&s;hes into execution. The whole body of the people had &s;wallowed deeply of the <HI>poi&s;on</HI> of church policy; <HI>pa&s;&s;ive obedience,</HI> by their means, had &s;o entirely &s;upplanted the <HI>ab&s;tract notion</HI> of the <HI>rights of men,</HI> which prevailed in the oppo&s;ition to Charles the fir&s;t; and &s;o de&s;irous were the triumphant party to prevent the revival of &s;uch a principle, by which their intere&s;ts had been af|fected, that they took care to confound the <HI>only ju&s;t authority</HI> they had for their conduct, in as great <HI>a mi&s;t of words and terms as po&s;&s;i|ble.</HI> Be&s;ides, would William, who was the &s;oul of the whole proceeding, have given way to a claim, by which, in the plaine&s;t terms, he was bound to his good behaviour?</P>
<P>Mr. Hume ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;es, that if the revolution had happened one hundred years after it did, it would have been <HI>materially dif|ferent</HI> in all its circum&s;tances. In&s;tead of thinking with Mr. Burke, that &s;uch a plain declaration of the rights of men would have tended to di&s;turb the quiet of the nation, I firmly believe that it would have had a contrary effect; for, in this ca&s;e, tho&s;e endle&s;s di&s;putes between the <HI>Nonjurors, Tories,</HI> and <HI>Whigs,</HI> would &s;oon have had an end. For, the que&s;tion not being involved in that <HI>ob&s;curity, contradiction,</HI> and <HI>ab&s;urdity,</HI> in which it was enveloped by the revolutioni&s;ts, <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>rea&s;on</HI> would have re&s;umed their &s;way; <HI>party jarjon</HI> would have been exploded; the people would have given a cheerful obedience to the new government; and that dreadful <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> by which Sir Robert Walpole excu&s;ed the intro|ducing a &s;ettled <HI>&s;y&s;tem of corruption</HI> into the admini&s;tration, would never have exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>When the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to a crown in one family, or even the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of private property, owes its origin to the people, mo&s;t undoubtedly the authority from whence it is derived, attaches it|&s;elf to the gift as equally in every individual of the family through the whole line of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as in the fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. And I can hardly believe, that there was <HI>one</HI> enlightened member who com|po&s;ed part of that legi&s;lative body who &s;ettled the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the throne, could po&s;&s;ibly think that body po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch a plenitude of power, as &s;hould give them a right, not only to <HI>&s;et a&s;ide</HI> the regu|lations of their ance&s;tors, but to <HI>bind their po&s;terity,</HI> to all &s;ucceeding generations, in the permanent chains of an unalterable law. Should we once admit of <HI>a power &s;o incompatible with the conditions of hu|manity,</HI> and only re&s;erved for the dictates of <HI>divine wi&s;dom,</HI> we have not, in the&s;e enlightened days, improved on the politicks of the fanatick athei&s;t Hobbes: <HI>For he &s;uppo&s;es an original right in the people to choo&s;e their governors;</HI> but, in exerting this right, the citi|zen and his po&s;terity for ever lo&s;e their native privileges, and be|come
<PB N="7" REF="023517_0007_0FBFC2831A349A58">
bound through the whole &s;eries of generations to the &s;ervice of a ma&s;ter's will.</P>
<P>We will now take into con&s;ideration the nature and tendency of the two different compliments which have been paid by Dr. Price and Mr. Burke to his Maje&s;ty and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. Dr. Price, I think, puts their right to government on the <HI>mo&s;t dignified,</HI> and perhaps, in the event of things, on the <HI>mo&s;t permanent</HI> footing. But Mr. Burke would have done well to con&s;ider, whether &s;uch a compliment as he is willing to pay to royalty is at all <HI>proper,</HI> ei|ther for the &s;ubject to make, or the King to receive. To a weak prince, it would be apt to cancel in his mind <HI>all the obligations</HI> which he owes to the people; and, by flattering him in a <HI>vain</HI> conceit of a mere per&s;onal right, tempt him to break tho&s;e &s;acred ties which ought to <HI>bind</HI> and <HI>direct</HI> his government. I am apt to believe, that almo&s;t <HI>all the vices</HI> of royal admini&s;tration have prin|cipally been occa&s;ioned by a <HI>&s;lavi&s;h adulation</HI> in the language of their &s;ubjects; and, to the <HI>&s;hame of the Engli&s;h people</HI> it mu&s;t be &s;poken, that none of the en&s;laved nations in the world addre&s;s the throne in a more <HI>ful&s;ome</HI> and <HI>hyperbolical</HI> &s;tile of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive flattery.</P>
<P>To a <HI>wi&s;e</HI> and a <HI>good</HI> prince, compliments of the &s;ame com|plexion, made and recommended by Mr. Burke, would be <HI>offen|&s;ive.</HI> He would con&s;ider it as taking away the <HI>noble&s;t</HI> and <HI>&s;afe&s;t title</HI> by which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es his power: He would con&s;ider it as ac|knowledging a kind of <HI>latent</HI> right in other families; and the liberality of his &s;entiment would incline him to triumph in the opinion, that he was <HI>called</HI> to government, and <HI>continued</HI> in it, by the <HI>choice</HI> and <HI>confidence</HI> of a free nation.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke &s;eems to adopt <HI>prejudice, opinion,</HI> and the powers of the <HI>imagination,</HI> as the <HI>&s;afe&s;t grounds</HI> on which <HI>wi&s;e</HI> and <HI>good</HI> &s;tate&s;|men can e&s;tabli&s;h or continue the happine&s;s of &s;ocieties. The&s;e have always been imputed by philo&s;ophers (a tribe of men whom indeed Mr. Burke affects much to de&s;pi&s;e) as cau&s;es which have produced all that is <HI>vicious</HI> and <HI>fooli&s;h</HI> in man, and con&s;equently have been the fruitful &s;ource of human <HI>mi&s;ery.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Burke has certainly a <HI>fine</HI> imagination; but I would not advi&s;e either <HI>him,</HI> or any of <HI>his admirers,</HI> to give <HI>too much</HI> way to &s;uch direction; for if from the virtue of our nature it does not lead us into <HI>crimes,</HI> it always involves us in <HI>error.</HI></P>
<P>The being put into a &s;ituation clearly to under&s;tand and to obey the <HI>principles of truth,</HI> appears to be the ba&s;is of our happine&s;s in this, and our perfection in another world; and the <HI>more</HI> truth is followed and pur&s;ued in this dark vale of human ignorance and mi&s;ery, the <HI>more</HI> we &s;hall <HI>increa&s;e</HI> our mundane felicity, and <HI>&s;ecure</HI> the ble&s;&s;ings of a future exi&s;tence. <HI>Every opinion</HI> which deviates from <HI>truth,</HI> mu&s;t ever be a <HI>treacherous</HI> guide; and the more it de|viates from it, it becomes the <HI>more dangerous.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="023517_0008_0FBFC28D31D391C8">
Though a fal&s;e opinion of the rights and powers of citizens may <HI>en&s;lave</HI> the ductile mind into a &s;tate of pa&s;&s;ive obedience, and thus &s;ecure the peace of government; yet in the &s;ame degree does it inflate the <HI>pride</HI> and <HI>arrogance</HI> of princes, until all con&s;iderations of <HI>rectitude</HI> give way to <HI>will,</HI> the barriers of per&s;onal &s;ecurity are flung down, and thence ari&s;es that <HI>tremendous nece&s;&s;ity</HI> which mu&s;t be followed by a &s;tate of <HI>violence</HI> and <HI>anarchy,</HI> which Mr. Burke &s;o <HI>ju&s;tly</HI> dreads. That this is the ca&s;e, the experience of all &s;oci|eties of men who acknowledge a <HI>power</HI> in their princes <HI>paramount</HI> to all re&s;i&s;tance, fully evinces. The&s;e &s;ocieties are obliged often to have recour&s;e to violence and ma&s;&s;acre; not indeed to e&s;tabli&s;h any popular rights, but in the way of force, to wreck their ven|geance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> their tyrants.</P>
<P>As to the right of <HI>ca&s;hiering</HI> or <HI>depo&s;ing</HI> monarchs for mi&s;gov|ernment, I cannot po&s;&s;ibly agree with Mr. Burke, that in England it only exi&s;ted in that Convention of the two Hou&s;es in 1688, which exerci&s;ed this power over King James and his legal &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors. But I am clearly of opinion, that it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> right that ought <HI>never</HI> to be exerci&s;ed by a people who are &s;ati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ed with their form of government, and have &s;pirit enough to correct its abu&s;es; and &s;o far from <HI>condemning</HI> the French nation for not depo&s;ing or exe|cuting their king, even though the <HI>&s;tronge&s;t pre&s;umptions</HI> of the <HI>mo&s;t atrocious guilt</HI> &s;hould have appeared again&s;t him, I think, had they elected any other per&s;on to that high office, they would have thrown difficulties in the way of their liberty, in&s;tead of improv|ing it. But it is the <HI>wi&s;dom,</HI> and not the <HI>folly</HI> of the National A&s;&s;embly, which gives <HI>offence</HI> to their <HI>enemies;</HI> and <HI>forces even Mr. Burke</HI> to contradict, in this in&s;tance, the rule which he has laid down, "That monarchs &s;hould not be depo&s;ed for mi&s;conduct, but only when its criminality is of a kind to render their govern|ment totally incompatible with the &s;afety of the people."</P>
<P>But before we leave the &s;ubject of Dr. Price's patriotick effu|&s;ions, we mu&s;t take notice of a very heavy charge laid again&s;t him by Mr. Burke&mdash;no le&s;s than that of <HI>prophaning</HI> the beautiful and prophetick ejaculation, commonly called, <HI>Nunc dimittis!</HI> made on the fir&s;t proclamation of our Saviour in the Temple, and applying it, <HI>"with an inhuman and unnatural rapture, to the mo&s;t horrid, atro|cious, and afflicting &s;pectacle,</HI> that perhaps was ever exhibited to the <HI>pity</HI> and <HI>indignation</HI> of mankind." That Mr. Burke's imagina|tion was greatly affected by a &s;cene, which he de&s;cribes in the highe&s;t glow of colouring, I can well believe; but Dr. Price, who cla&s;&s;es with that de&s;cription of men &s;tiled by Mr. Burke <HI>ab&s;tract philo&s;ophers,</HI> has been u&s;ed to carry his mind, in a long &s;eries of ideas, to the con&s;equences of actions which ari&s;e in the pa&s;&s;ing &s;cene. Dr. Price then, with <HI>full as much &s;ympathy</HI> in him <HI>as even
<PB N="9" REF="023517_0009_0FBFC28F29F7C640">
Mr. Burke</HI> can have, might not be greatly moved with the morti|fications and &s;ufferings of a <HI>very few per&s;ons,</HI> however highly di&s;|tingui&s;hed for the &s;plendour of their rank, when tho&s;e mortifica|tions led the way, or &s;ecured the <HI>pre&s;ent and future happine&s;s of twenty four millions of people, with their po&s;terity,</HI> emancipated by their <HI>manly</HI> exertions, from all that is <HI>degrading</HI> and <HI>afflicting</HI> to the &s;en&s;ible mind; and let into the immediate ble&s;&s;ings of <HI>per&s;on|al &s;ecurity,</HI> and to the enjoyment of tho&s;e advantages which above <HI>all others</HI> mu&s;t be delightful to the feelings of an high &s;pirited people.</P>
<P>The <HI>events</HI> of human life, when <HI>properly</HI> con&s;idered, are but a &s;eries of <HI>benevolent providences:</HI> Many of them, though very im|portant in their con&s;equences, are too much confounded with the common tran&s;actions of men, to be ob&s;erved; but whenever the believer thinks he perceives the <HI>omnipotent will</HI> more immediately declaring it&s;elf in favour of the future <HI>perfection</HI> and <HI>happine&s;s</HI> of the moral world, he is naturally led into the &s;ame ec&s;tacies of <HI>hope</HI> and <HI>gratitude,</HI> with which Simeon was tran&s;ported by the view of the infant Me&s;&s;iah. Has Mr. Burke never heard of any mille|nium, but that fanciful one which is &s;uppo&s;ed to exi&s;t in the kingdom of the &s;aints? If this &s;hould be the ca&s;e, I would recom|mend to him to read <HI>Newton on the Prophecies.</HI> He will find that this mo&s;t re&s;pectable Bi&s;hop, <HI>who was no ranter,</HI> is of opinion, that <HI>&s;ome pa&s;&s;ages</HI> in the Revelations point out a period of time when the <HI>iron</HI> &s;ceptre of <HI>arbitrary</HI> &s;way &s;hall be broken; when <HI>righ|teou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall prevail</HI> over the whole earth, and a <HI>correct</HI> &s;y&s;tem of equity take place in the conduct of man. Every providence, therefore, by which any <HI>in&s;uperable object</HI> to this tran&s;cendent ble&s;&s;|ing appears to be taken away, mu&s;t rationally draw forth ejacula|tions of <HI>gratitude</HI> from the <HI>benevolent</HI> Chri&s;tian. What ideas do more naturally a&s;&s;ociate in the human mind, than tho&s;e of the fir&s;t appearance of the infant Je&s;us, and his future univer&s;al reign in the hearts of his people?</P>
<P>But Mr. Burke thinks, that there was at lea&s;t a great impropri|ety in expre&s;&s;ing an approbation of the &s;pirited conduct of the French nation, before time and circum&s;tances had manife&s;ted that the freedom they had gained, had been u&s;ed with <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> in the forming a new con&s;titution of government, or in improving the old one. "When I &s;ee," &s;ays Mr. Burke, "the &s;pirit of liberty in action, I &s;ee a &s;trong principle at work; and this for a while is all I can po&s;&s;ibly know of it. The wild gas, the fixed air, is plainly broke loo&s;e; but we ought to &s;u&s;pend our judgment un|til the fir&s;t efferve&s;cence is a little &s;ub&s;ided, till the liquor is clear|ed, and until we &s;ee &s;omething deeper than the agitation of a troubled and frothy &s;urface."</P>

The French Revolution was attended with &s;omething &s;o <HI>new</HI> in the hi&s;tory of human affairs; there was &s;omething &s;o <HI>&s;ingular,</HI> &s;o <HI>unique,</HI> in that <HI>perfect</HI> unanimity in the people; in that <HI>firm</HI> &s;pirit which ba&s;hed <HI>every hope</HI> in the <HI>intere&s;ted,</HI> that they could po&s;|&s;ibly divide them into parties, and render them the in&s;truments of a re&s;ubjection to their old bondage; that it naturally excited the <HI>&s;urpri&s;e</HI> and the <HI>admiration</HI> of all men.

<P>This was a triumph of <HI>&s;ufficient importance</HI> to call forth the ex|ultation of individuals, and the approbation of &s;ocieties. But the two clubs who have the <HI>misfortune</HI> to fall under Mr. Burke's &s;evere cen&s;ure, did not te&s;tify a formal approbation of the conduct of their neighbours, till the deputies they had cho&s;en for the tran&s;action of their affairs, had manife&s;ted a virtue <HI>equal</HI> to &s;o high a tru&s;t; for no &s;ooner was the power of the court <HI>&s;ufficiently</HI> &s;ub|dued to enable them to act with <HI>freedom</HI> and <HI>effect,</HI> than they gave an example of <HI>di&s;intere&s;ted magnanimity,</HI> that has <HI>no parallel</HI> in the conduct of <HI>any</HI> preceding a&s;&s;embly of men, and which was <HI>never &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by any individual.</HI> That memorable day in which the members of the National A&s;&s;embly, with a <HI>virtuous enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> vied with each other in the alacrity with which they &s;urrendered to the people all their feudal privileges, will for ever &s;tand in the records of time as a monument of their <HI>&s;ingular greatne&s;s.</HI> Such an in&s;tance of human virtue was &s;urely a <HI>proper &s;ubject of applau&s;e and congratulation.</HI></P>
<P>Men who have &s;uffered in their per&s;onal intere&s;ts by the new order of things in France, mu&s;t naturally be inclined to <HI>exagger|ate</HI> every blemi&s;h which appears in the conduct of a multitude, by who&s;e &s;pirit they have been deprived of many fond privileges. Their <HI>petulant</HI> ob&s;ervations, whil&s;t their minds are <HI>heated</HI> by im|aginary wrongs and injuries, is <HI>excu&s;able;</HI> becau&s;e it is a <HI>weakne&s;s</HI> almo&s;t in&s;eparable from <HI>human frailty.</HI> It would, however, have become <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> from whom might have been expected a <HI>more &s;ympathi&s;ing</HI> indulgence towards the <HI>friends</HI> and <HI>promoters</HI> of liberty, to have been more <HI>candid</HI> in their cen&s;ures; but in no part of Europe perhaps, have the evils which mu&s;t <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> attend all Revolutions, and e&s;pecially a Revolution &s;o <HI>complete</HI> and <HI>compre|hen&s;ive</HI> as that which has taken place in France, been <HI>more exagger|ated,</HI> and <HI>more affectedly</HI> lamently.</P>
<P>Had this <HI>great work</HI> been effected without the &s;hedding one drop of <HI>innocent</HI> or even <HI>guilty</HI> blood, without doubt it would have better plea&s;ed the <HI>generous</HI> and <HI>benevolent</HI> mind. But, was it <HI>po&s;&s;i|ble</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="023517_0011_0FBFC292246B70C8">
that &s;uch a plea&s;ing circum&s;tance could ever have had an exi&s;t|ence? If we take into con&s;ideration that <HI>animo&s;ity</HI> which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the <HI>ari&s;tocrati&s;ts</HI> and <HI>democrati&s;ts</HI> on the eve of the Revo|lution, an animo&s;ity which was greatly heightened by the impru|dent <HI>in&s;ults</HI> which the <HI>Tier Etat</HI> had received from the fir&s;t men|tioned body, we &s;hall rather <HI>wonder at the moderation</HI> with which the people u&s;ed their <HI>complete</HI> victory, than lament their cruelty.

<P>The puni&s;hment of the lamp po&s;t, it mu&s;t be owned, &s;trikes terror to the mind, and calls forth an immediate effu&s;ion of <HI>&s;ym|pathy</HI> to the &s;ufferer. But when <HI>candid reflection</HI> &s;uper&s;edes the <HI>fir&s;t emotions</HI> of human tenderne&s;s, this truth will force it&s;elf on our con&s;ideration, that a people who had been u&s;ed to &s;uch <HI>barba|rous</HI> &s;pectacles as that of beholding wretches, who&s;e <HI>de&s;titute pov|erty</HI> had in a manner <HI>compelled</HI> to the forlorn cour&s;e of highway robbery, broken on a wheel, and <HI>lingering</HI> out the la&s;t hours of life under the <HI>agonizing</HI> &s;trokes of a &s;tern executioner, would nat|urally regard hanging as a <HI>mild</HI> puni&s;hment on men whom they con&s;idered as the wor&s;t of criminals. Let us rejoice, then, that &s;uch <HI>dreadful legal executions,</HI> which mu&s;t from their nature tend to <HI>barbari&s;e</HI> men, are happily put an end to by the Revolution.</P>
<P>But Mr. Burke is now come to a &s;cene which is calculated to draw forth <HI>all</HI> the energies of his imagination, and which con&s;e|quently he de&s;cribes with the <HI>highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible</HI> colouring. This is no other than the 6th of October, 1789, when the king and queen were led in triumph to Paris. I very much <HI>honour the king of France</HI> for that ea&s;e of temper which has enabled him to go through all his per&s;onal mortifications with <HI>a manly dignity;</HI> but it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that he brought them on him&s;elf, by a conduct, which, to &s;ay the be&s;t of it, was altogether imprudent.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="023517_0012_0FBFC29447D88B80">
The fir&s;t involuntary vi&s;it which he made to the capital, was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, to appea&s;e the <HI>fears</HI> and the <HI>re&s;entment</HI> which had been rai&s;ed by his <HI>ineffectual</HI> attempt to <HI>awe</HI> the deliberations and the re&s;olutions of the National A&s;&s;embly by an <HI>armed</HI> force. In the &s;econd, he was carried to Paris to <HI>prevent</HI> the execution of a <HI>de&s;ign</HI> formed by the court cabal, which, had it &s;ucceeded, might have <HI>deluged</HI> the nation in blood, and furni&s;hed the fuel of civil di&s;cord for years.</P>
<P>The Pari&s;ians &s;hewed no intention, or even de&s;ire, to deprive in any re&s;pect their king of his per&s;onal liberty; till, by a very &s;u&s;pi|cious conduct, he appeared to have manife&s;ted a de&s;ign to corrupt the fidelity of his guards to their new government, and to &s;et up the &s;tandard of arms in that quarter of the kingdom where the friends of de&s;poti&s;m from every part of Europe might repair with &s;afety. The <HI>great</HI> and <HI>unabating</HI> rage and indignation which the enemies to the new con&s;titution have &s;hewn for what they term the captivity of the king, plainly evinces the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> that urged the mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Having endeavoured to &s;hew the futility of Mr. Burke's ob&s;er|vations and cen&s;ures on the Revolution and Con&s;titutional Socie|ties; and likewi&s;e, that his &s;evere pointed reflections on the con|duct of the French nation, for having, as he &s;ays, committed on the vanqui&s;hed party the mo&s;t <HI>unexampled</HI> acts of atrocious vio|lence, are not founded either in <HI>truth</HI> or <HI>rea&s;on;</HI> I &s;hall proceed with my critical reflections on the animadver&s;ions of my author, who goes on in a very <HI>free manner</HI> to cen&s;ure every part of the French con&s;titution, to draw a compari&s;on between the Briti&s;h and the Gallie governments as they now exi&s;t, and to e&s;tabli&s;h, in the way of rea&s;oning, a &s;uperiority in favour of the government of his own country.</P>
<P>To &s;hew that the National A&s;&s;embly have committed a very <HI>gro&s;s</HI> and <HI>ruinous</HI> error, in the building a new &s;tructure, in&s;tead of improving an old one; Mr. Burke cites, in a triumphant manner, the conduct of the Engli&s;h nation. Our olde&s;t reformation, he ob&s;erves, is that of <HI>Magna Charta.</HI> "You will &s;ee, &s;ays he, ad|dre&s;&s;ing his corre&s;pondent, that Sir Edward Coke, that great oracle of our law, and indeed all the great men who follow him to Black&s;tone, are indu&s;trious to prove the pedigree of our liberties. They endeavour to prove, that the ancient Charta, the Magna Charta of king John, was connected with another po&s;itive Charta from Henry the fir&s;t, and that both the one and the other were nothing more than a reaffirmance of the &s;till more ancient &s;tanding law of the kingdom." "In the famous law of the third of Charles the fir&s;t, called the Petition of Right, the Parliament &s;ays to the king&mdash;Your &s;ubjects have inherited this freedom (claiming
<PB N="13" REF="023517_0013_0FBFC296CE1387E8">
their franchi&s;es) not on ab&s;tract principles as the rights of men, but as the rights of Engli&s;hmen, and as a patrimony derived from their forefathers."</P>
<P>This language of the parliament, when pleading for the free|dom of their countrymen at the tribunal of a prince's throne, who was as little inclined to <HI>admit,</HI> and who&s;e <HI>prejudices</HI> enabled him as little to <HI>under&s;tand</HI> the only rea&s;onable grounds of the argument as any de&s;pot who ever &s;wayed an ea&s;tern &s;ceptre, was well adapted to the <HI>character</HI> of the prince, and the <HI>ignorance</HI> of the multitude. But had the <HI>circum&s;tances</HI> of Charles enabled him to <HI>&s;peak</HI> and to <HI>enforce</HI> the &s;entiments of his mind, he would undoubtedly have made the following reply: You tell me upon your <HI>own</HI> authority, and the authority of <HI>your lawyers,</HI> that what you plead &s;o &s;trenu|ou&s;ly for, is a patrimony derived from your forefathers, and grounded on the ancient law of the land. Be it &s;o&mdash;Was not this ancient law <HI>&s;uper&s;eded by the authority of arms,</HI> and the <HI>entire</HI> &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the people to the Norman code e&s;tabli&s;hed by Will|iam the Conqueror? <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> then, and the other charters, mu&s;t either have been <HI>extorted</HI> from the <HI>imbecility</HI> of the princes who granted them, or they mu&s;t have i&s;&s;ued from the <HI>voluntary donations of monarchs;</HI> in either ca&s;e, they only &s;tand on a <HI>re&s;uma|ble</HI> right.</P>
<P>What the parliament could have an&s;wered to this plea, I know not, without calling in the aid of an <HI>ab&s;tract right;</HI> which they endeavoured to keep out of the view of the king, with as much care as Mr. Burke <HI>endeavours</HI> to keep it out of the view of all men. But certain it is, that the king, though he did not explicitly de|clare with all their force the above mentioned &s;entiments, yet he acted agreeable to their tenor the moment he got rid of this trou|ble&s;ome a&s;&s;embly: For, con&s;idering the articles of the petition of right as a <HI>gift depending on his plea&s;ure to fulfil or to re&s;ume,</HI> he broke them whenever they thwarted his &s;y&s;tem of admini&s;tration, and <HI>impri&s;oned</HI> tho&s;e who on the &s;trength of this &s;tatute with&s;tood his authority.</P>
<P>I have my&s;elf always con&s;idered the boa&s;ted birthright of an Engli&s;hman, as an <HI>arrogant</HI> preten&s;ion, built on a <HI>beggarly</HI> founda|tion. It is an arrogant preten&s;ion, becau&s;e it intimates a kind of exclu&s;ion to the re&s;t of mankind from the &s;ame privileges; and it is beggarly, becau&s;e it re&s;ts our legitimate freedom on the <HI>alms</HI> of our princes.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t own I was &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ed to find a gentleman of poli&s;hed manners, who has &s;pent the be&s;t part of his life in the company of tho&s;e who <HI>affect</HI> the nice&s;t conformity to the rules of a refined civility, addre&s;&s;ing the augu&s;t repre&s;entatives of the mo&s;t <HI>gallant</HI> and <HI>re&s;pectable</HI> of the European nations, in terms which I

&s;hould not u&s;e to a &s;et of chimney &s;weepers, though acting the mo&s;t ridiculou&s;ly out of their &s;phere. Neither do I choo&s;e to re|peat all tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of ineffable contempt, which the &s;trong glow of Mr. Burke's imagination has &s;cattered through the whole of his reprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>It is not my intention to make any formal compari&s;on between the new con&s;titution of France, and the pre&s;ent exi&s;ting con&s;titu|tion of England; or to pre&s;ume to cen&s;ure a government, from which an indu&s;trious people receive protection, and with which the large majority of the nation are entirely &s;atisfied. Yet it may not be inexpedient to ob&s;erve, that we cannot with any grounds of <HI>rea&s;on</HI> or <HI>propriety,</HI> &s;et up our own con&s;titution as the model which all other nations ought <HI>implicitly</HI> to follow, unle&s;s we are <HI>certain</HI> that it be&s;tows the <HI>greate&s;t</HI> po&s;&s;ible happine&s;s on the people which in the nature of things any government can be&s;tow. We ought to be <HI>certain,</HI> that this <HI>model</HI> will bear the mo&s;t <HI>nice</HI> and <HI>critical</HI> examination. It ought to be void of any of tho&s;e <HI>obvious,</HI> or more <HI>concealed</HI> cau&s;es, which produce <HI>pre&s;ent evils,</HI> and carry the mind to apprehen&s;ions of <HI>future mi&s;chiefs.</HI> We ought not at lea&s;t to have had a <HI>national debt,</HI> &s;welled to a <HI>magnitude</HI> which <HI>ter|rifies</HI> even the <HI>mo&s;t &s;anguine</HI> for its con&s;equences. Our parliaments ought to have been <HI>eminently</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hed for their <HI>integrity,</HI> and a <HI>total</HI> independence of any <HI>corrupt influence;</HI> and no <HI>nece&s;&s;ity ought to have exi&s;ted in our affairs,</HI> which have obliged us to <HI>endure impo&s;ts</HI> which our ance&s;tors would have <HI>rejected with horror,</HI> and <HI>re&s;i&s;ted.</HI> If an Engli&s;hman &s;ees any thing which is ami&s;s in his own gov|ernment, he ought not undoubtedly to look forward to any other remedy than tho&s;e which the lenient hand of reformation will &s;upply. But when the old ve&s;&s;el of a commonwealth is <HI>torn to pieces</HI> by the <HI>&s;hocks</HI> it has &s;u&s;tained from <HI>contending parties;</HI> when the people, di&s;daining and rejecting all tho&s;e fond opinions by which they have been <HI>en&s;laved to mi&s;ery,</HI> a&s;&s;ert their native right of forming a government for them&s;elves; &s;urely in &s;uch a ca&s;e the builders are bound by no law of <HI>duty</HI> or <HI>rea&s;on</HI> to make u&s;e of the&s;e old materials in the &s;tructure of their new con&s;titution, which they &s;uppo&s;e to have been of an injurious tendency. The leaders of the French Revolution, and their followers, &s;ee <HI>none of tho&s;e &s;triking beauties</HI> in the old laws and rules of the Gothick in|&s;titutions of Europe, which Mr. Burke does. They do not pro|fe&s;s to have any of the &s;pirit of antiquarians among them; and they have not perceived, in the experience of old or ancient times, a <HI>perfect harmony</HI> ari&s;ing from <HI>oppo&s;ition</HI> of intere&s;ts; nor can they <HI>under&s;tand</HI> how &s;uch a combination can be formed as &s;hall produce it.

<PB N="15" REF="023517_0015_0FBFC2A272E75388">
<HI>de&s;ign</HI> which the experience of ages affords to the wi&s;dom of man.

<P>Mr. Burke, rea&s;oning from what I regard as a groundle&s;s &s;up|po&s;ition, very pathetically laments, and very &s;everely reprehends the conduct of tho&s;e, who, holding out fal&s;e and treacherous lures to the king, led him into conce&s;&s;ions fatal to his per&s;onal power, and the con&s;titution of the monarchy. That the parliaments of France never intended to make any <HI>alteration</HI> in the old govern|ment, I am thoroughly per&s;uaded; and I am equally per&s;uaded, that they fondly imagined the people would <HI>freely</HI> give their money for the redre&s;s of &s;ome of the mo&s;t heavy of the grievances under which they laboured. They knew, by the experience of pa&s;t times, that in voting by orders, the people had never gained any <HI>&s;olid</HI> advantage from an a&s;&s;embly of the States General. Neither the court, nor the parliament of Paris, who made the king &s;o many &s;plendid promi&s;es, were aware of the con&s;equences which mu&s;t ari&s;e from the general &s;pread of knowledge among the peo|ple; and in the event of things, they were <HI>both di&s;appointed</HI> of their purpo&s;es; for the <HI>Tier Etat,</HI> reflecting on the <HI>old practices</HI> which the <HI>crown,</HI> the <HI>clergy,</HI> and the <HI>nobility</HI> had u&s;ed again&s;t them, were determined to throw the whole weight of their natural &s;cale into the balance, and to redre&s;s their own grievances, without waiting the effect of <HI>humble</HI> petitions and <HI>di&s;cordant</HI> councils. That neither the king, nor the parliaments of France, could long have prevented the <HI>full</HI> exertion of this power, (had they fore&s;een all the con&s;equences which did ari&s;e from &s;uffering the meeting of the States General,) is to me very plain.

"This breach of confidence," as Mr. Burke terms it, "to an ea&s;y and conde&s;cending king, will have a dreadful effect on the intere&s;ts of mankind, by &s;anctifying the dark &s;u&s;picious maxims of tyrannous di&s;tru&s;t; and will teach kings to tremble at what will be called the delu&s;ive plau&s;ibilities of <HI>moral politicians."</HI> Be this as it may, the people of France had <HI>certainly</HI> a right to provide for their own <HI>&s;ecurity</HI> and <HI>welfare</HI> on tho&s;e principles which <HI>they</HI> thought the mo&s;t conducive to this <HI>great end,</HI> and to leave it to the wi&s;dom of other nations to make &s;uitable provi&s;ion for theirs.

<P>Though I have hitherto &s;pared my readers a detail of all the &s;evere invectives which Mr. Burke has u&s;ed again&s;t the leading members who compo&s;e the National A&s;&s;embly; yet, for the &s;ake of tho&s;e principles of <HI>moral rectitude</HI> which the torrent of his elo|quence appears to <HI>baffle</HI> and <HI>confound,</HI> it will be nece&s;&s;ary to notice his ob&s;ervations on the character and conduct of the nobles who have taken the lead in the French revolution, and who yet con|tinue to &s;upport it. He accu&s;es them with having a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the &s;poil and humiliation of their own order, to po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;ure fund for their new followers. "To be attached to the &s;ubdivi&s;ion, to love the little platoon we belong to in &s;ociety (&s;ays Mr. Burke) is the fir&s;t principle, the germ as it were, of publick affections: It is the fir&s;t link in the &s;eries by which we proceed towards a love of our country and mankind."</P>
<P>What <HI>&s;plendid emoluments</HI> and what <HI>grand objects</HI> of per&s;onal ambition tho&s;e noblemen could have in view, who, whil&s;t they <HI>generou&s;ly</HI> &s;acrificed tho&s;e privileges which are the mo&s;t fondly cov|eted by human vanity, &s;hut out their entrance to the publick of|fices of the &s;tate, by re&s;olutions which rendered &s;uch promotions incompatible with their legi&s;lative tru&s;t, I know not; but I hope we &s;hall not be &s;o much <HI>blinded</HI> with the &s;plendour of dazzling images, as to confound tho&s;e <HI>narrow affections</HI> which bind &s;mall bodies together by the mutual ties of per&s;onal intere&s;t, to that <HI>lib|eral benevolence,</HI> which, di&s;daining the con&s;ideration of every &s;elfi&s;h good, cheerfully &s;acrifices <HI>a per&s;onal intere&s;t</HI> to the <HI>welfare</HI> of the community.</P>
<P>Of the li&s;t of individuals whom Mr. Burke &s;elects as examples of <HI>true glory,</HI> and as benefactors rather than de&s;troyers of their country, &s;ome of them ought to have been for ever &s;tampt with <HI>infamy,</HI> as the <HI>pe&s;ts</HI> and <HI>tyrants</HI> of their &s;pecies; and they are all of them of doubtful fame, as to any <HI>honour</HI> derived to their country by their ambitious projects, unle&s;s a <HI>nation of &s;laves can receive glory</HI> from <HI>a capacity</HI> of becoming the <HI>&s;courage</HI> of other &s;ocieties.</P>

remainder out of the kingdom. Cromwell, indeed, who depriv|ed his &s;overeign of life, <HI>merely to u&s;urp his power,</HI> has, with many people, paid the debt of his crimes, by having, through the gen|eral dete&s;tation which men conceived of his <HI>treachery</HI> and <HI>tyranny,</HI> rendered the Revolution and the Revolutioni&s;ts odious, and thus paved the way for the re&s;toration of the old government.</P>
<P>In the next argument pre&s;ented to our attention, Mr. Burke has very &s;trongly entrenched him&s;elf in the holds of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution; and we will not attempt to pur&s;ue him into his for|tre&s;s: For though a natural vanity <HI>might flatter us</HI> with a <HI>delu&s;ive hope</HI> of victory, ari&s;ing from the &s;ubtle objections which may be urged to every political propo&s;ition; yet the victory would co&s;t <HI>too dear,</HI> if it &s;ubjected us to the reproach of any de&s;ign again&s;t the peace and quiet of the community. But it will not, I think, be deviating from the highe&s;t point of decency and prudence, to make our objections to his general a&s;&s;ertions. His propo&s;ition, "that it is the great ma&s;&s;es of property which form a natural ram|part about the le&s;&s;er properties in all their gradations," is not in our opinion founded in truth; for every citizen who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es e|ver &s;o &s;mall a &s;hare of property, is <HI>equally</HI> as tenacious of it as the mo&s;t opulent member of &s;ociety; and this leads him to <HI>re&s;pect</HI> and to <HI>&s;upport</HI> all the laws by which property is protected. It is this &s;en&s;e of per&s;onal intere&s;t, which running through every rank in &s;ociety, and attaching it&s;elf to every one of its members who are not in the condition of a pauper, forms an impenetrable barrier to the &s;ecurity of wealth; for otherwi&s;e, as the numbers of the opulent mu&s;t be <HI>very</HI> &s;mall in proportion to the number of tho&s;e who form the great ma&s;s of the people, <HI>envy</HI> would operate &s;o &s;uc|ce&s;sfully again&s;t them as to de&s;troy the force of artificial &s;upports.</P>
<P>When the con&s;titution of France is compleatly &s;ettled, and the commonwealth re&s;ts upon its ba&s;is, this di&s;po&s;ition of the human mind which operates &s;o powerfully for the pre&s;ervation of peace and order, will, as on former occa&s;ions, regain its natural force. For the operations of <HI>power</HI> on the property of the citizen, is not an <HI>unexempled</HI> event in the hi&s;tories of civil &s;ocieties.</P>

<P>The National A&s;&s;embly of France are at one time accu&s;ed by Mr. Burke of a &s;cheme for <HI>perpetuating</HI> their power, at the expen&s;e of the rights of election; at another, of acting <HI>weakly</HI> and <HI>meanly</HI> in the having <HI>limited</HI> their &s;itting to the <HI>&s;hort &s;pace of two years.</HI> In one view of things, they are accu&s;ed of drawing to them&s;elves, and to the city of Paris, <HI>an exorbitance of power,</HI> which, if not re|&s;i&s;ted, mu&s;t end in the total &s;ubjection of the provinces, who&s;e nat|ural productions and acquired wealth are to be exhau&s;ted to pam|per the luxury and gratify the avarice of the capital. In another, their politicks are arraigned, for having left no leading <HI>controling power</HI> in the empire, of <HI>&s;ufficient energy</HI> to &s;upport a nece&s;&s;ary &s;ub|ordination of its parts. Such <HI>palpable contradictions,</HI> &s;uch <HI>little arts</HI> of <HI>mi&s;repre&s;entation</HI> we have &s;een daily thrown out in the publick papers by the <HI>ho&s;tile faction,</HI> who naturally endeavour to <HI>mi&s;lead</HI> the people into a <HI>di&s;tru&s;t</HI> of their deputies, becau&s;e they have guard|ed their liberties with too nice and too jealous a care. But we did not expect to &s;ee them collected together and &s;et off with all the powers of literary compo&s;ition, by one of the greate&s;t orators of the age; and this in a work which the author holds out as an <HI>exact &s;tandard,</HI> by which the limits of <HI>power</HI> and of <HI>freedom</HI> are from henceforth <HI>to receive their bounds.</HI> Neither did we expect to find that the <HI>humane</HI> writer would have &s;o far entered into the pa&s;&s;ions of the di&s;contented party, as to <HI>envy</HI> the people of Paris that bread which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and which can|not be otherwi&s;e &s;upplied but by the produce of the provinces.</P>
<P>We were al&s;o greatly &s;urprized to find Mr. Burke entering into &s;uch contradictions, as at <HI>one time</HI> to repre&s;ent the excellencies of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution as <HI>obvious</HI> to every ob&s;erver, and &s;o &s;en&s;i|bly felt by its &s;ubjects as <HI>unanimou&s;ly</HI> to bind their affections to its principles, its rules, and its dictates; to the exception only of a few <HI>idle, in&s;ignificant, &s;peculative individuals:</HI> And <HI>at another, trem|bling</HI> left if the que&s;tion of the ab&s;tract rights of men were brought before the eyes of the people, the mo&s;t <HI>dreadful</HI> confu&s;ions might fol|low, and be attended with the <HI>utter downfall</HI> of every order in the church and &s;tate, of <HI>every exclu&s;ive</HI> privilege exi&s;ting in its bodies corporate, and with the <HI>general</HI> pillage of the rich.</P>
<P>Such repre&s;entations are certainly well adapted to <HI>rou&s;e</HI> the &s;el|fi&s;h pa&s;&s;ions of the <HI>timid</HI> mind, and may &s;erve the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e of the <HI>hour;</HI> but they will not &s;tand the more <HI>candid</HI> and <HI>cool</HI> de|ci&s;ions which attend on <HI>time.</HI></P>

"But government (&s;ays Mr. Burke) is not made in virtue of natural rights, which may and do exi&s;t in total independence of it; and exi&s;t in much greater clearne&s;s, and in a much greater degree of ab&s;tract perfection; but their ab&s;tract perfection is their practical defect. By having a right to every thing, they want every thing. Government is a contrivance of human wi&s;dom, to provide for human wants. Men have a right that the&s;e wants &s;hould be provided for by this wi&s;dom. Among the&s;e wants is to be reckoned the want out of a civil &s;ociety, of a &s;ufficient re|&s;traint upon their pa&s;&s;ions. Society requires not only that the pa&s;&s;ions of individuals &s;hould be &s;ubjected, but even in the ma&s;s and body, as well as in the individuals, the inclinations of men &s;hould frequently be thwarted, their will controled, and their pa&s;&s;ions brought into &s;ubjection. This can only be done by a power out of them&s;elves, and not in the exerci&s;e of its functions, &s;ubject to that will, and to tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, which it is in its office to bridle and &s;ubdue. In this &s;en&s;e, the re&s;traints of men, as well as their liberties, are to be reckoned among their rights."</P>

their tru&s;t. To proceed with Mr. Burke's argument&mdash;&s;hould the rich and opulent in the nation plead their right to the predomin|ant &s;way in &s;ociety, from its being a nece&s;&s;ary circum&s;tance to guard their wealth from the gripe of poverty, the men in an inferior &s;tate of fortune might argue, that &s;hould they give way <HI>to this plea in all its extent,</HI> their moderate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions would be expo&s;ed to the burden of <HI>unequal</HI> taxes; for the rich, when po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the <HI>whole</HI> authority of the &s;tate, would be &s;ure to take the <HI>fir&s;t care</HI> of them&s;elves, if they &s;hould not be tempted to &s;ecure an exoneration of <HI>all</HI> burthens, by dividing the &s;poils of the public; and that the <HI>abu&s;e</HI> of &s;uch high tru&s;ts mu&s;t <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> ari&s;e, becau&s;e to act by &s;elfi&s;h con&s;iderations, is in the very con&s;titution of our nature.</P>
<P>To &s;uch pleas, &s;o plau&s;ibly urged on all &s;ides, I know of no <HI>ra|tional</HI> objection; nor can I think of any expedient to remove the well grounded apprehen&s;ions of the different intere&s;ts which com|po&s;e a commonwealth, than a <HI>fair</HI> and <HI>equal</HI> repre&s;entation of the <HI>whole</HI> people;&mdash;a circum&s;tance which appears very peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary in a mixed form of government, where the democratic part of the con&s;titution will ever be in danger of being overborne by the energy attending on its higher con&s;tituent parts.</P>
<P>On &s;uch grounds of rea&s;oning, there will be found no in&s;upe|rable objections to tho&s;e propo&s;itions of Dr. Price, which are &s;o highly cen&s;ured by Mr. Burke, as containing principles of the mo&s;t <HI>&s;editious</HI> and <HI>dangerous</HI> nature; even though we &s;hould allow that every government which accords with the opinions and the inclinations of the large majority of the people, is, in an high &s;en&s;e of the term, a legitimate government.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now proceed with that cour&s;e of the argument in which Mr. Burke endeavours to &s;hew, that the <HI>unequal</HI> repre&s;ent|ation which he allows to have taken place in <HI>our government,</HI> is a <HI>perfection</HI> rather than a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> "With us, when we elect popu|lar repre&s;entatives, (&s;ays Mr. Burke, &s;till addre&s;&s;ing his French corre&s;pondent,) we &s;end them to a council in which each man individually is a &s;ubject, and &s;ubmitted to a government com|plete in all its ordinary functions. With you the elective a&s;&s;em|bly is the &s;overeign, and the &s;ole &s;overeign; all the members therefore are integral parts of the &s;ole &s;overeignty. But with us, it is totally different. With us, the repre&s;entatives &s;eparated from the other parts, can have no action, and no exi&s;tence. The government is the point of reference of the &s;everal members and di&s;tricts of our re|pre&s;entation. This is the centre of our unity. This government of reference is a tru&s;tee for the whole, and not for the parts. So is the other branch of our public council; I mean the Hou&s;e of Lords. With us, the King and the Lords are &s;everal and joint &s;ecurities for the equality of each di&s;trict, each province, each city. When
<PB N="21" REF="023517_0021_0FBFC2AF35411268">
did you hear in Great Britain of any province &s;uffering from the inequality of repre&s;entation? what di&s;trict from having no re|pre&s;entation at all? Not only our monarchy and our peerage &s;e|cure the equality on which our unity depends, but it is the &s;pirit of the Hou&s;e of Commons it&s;elf. The very inequality of repre|&s;entation, which is &s;o <HI>fooli&s;hly</HI> complained of, is perhaps the very thing which prevents us from thinking or acting as members for di&s;tricts. Cornwall elects as many members as all Scotland; but is Cornwall better taken care of than Scotland?"</P>
<P>If your Lord&s;hip &s;ees the re&s;ult of this argument in the &s;ame light as I do, you will con&s;ider it as equally recommendatory to an election of the <HI>Lower Hou&s;e</HI> in the <HI>King</HI> and the <HI>Lords,</HI> as of an inadequate repre&s;entation made by the election of the Commons. For if the <HI>King</HI> and the <HI>Lords</HI> are &s;everal and joint &s;ecurities for the equality of each di&s;trict, each province, and each city; why &s;hould we throw the country into a &s;tate of <HI>riot</HI> and <HI>confu&s;ion</HI> eve|ry &s;even years? Why &s;hould we put our&s;elves to electioneering <HI>expen&s;es?</HI> Would it not be a <HI>more convenient</HI> method to &s;uffer the <HI>King</HI> and the Hou&s;e of <HI>Lords to chu&s;e</HI> our repre&s;entatives?</P>

<P>In the per&s;onal mortifications of the Queen of France, Mr. Burke finds great rea&s;on to lament that the age of chivalry is no more; for had the &s;ame &s;pirit exi&s;ted in this, that exi&s;ted in pa&s;t ages, "ten thou&s;and &s;words might have leaped from their &s;cab|bards, to <HI>avenge even alook</HI> that threatened her with in&s;ult." The high colouring given by Mr. Burke to tho&s;e &s;cenes of regal di&s;|tre&s;s, will, I doubt not, captivate the imagination of the greater number of his readers, in a degree equal to the effects produced on the author by the <HI>charms</HI> of the Queen of France. But the <HI>delu&s;ions</HI> of fancy are apt to &s;ub&s;ide in men of <HI>cool</HI> minds, when any <HI>great</HI> object of publick concern is held up to their view, to the prejudice even of beauty and dignity, and all tho&s;e external objects, adapted rather to <HI>en&s;lave</HI> our affections, than to <HI>lead</HI> our judgement.</P>
<P>The bringing the king and queen to Paris, and thus, by pre|venting their e&s;cape, to di&s;able them from forming new troubles in the kingdom, was certainly regarded as a mea&s;ure of the <HI>highe&s;t nece&s;&s;ity;</HI> and in this view, mu&s;t have been approved by the true friends of the revolution, although it was attended with tumult and di&s;order.</P>
<P>The age in which the &s;pirit of chivalry was triumphantly pre|valent, would indeed have been a very <HI>improper</HI> time to have at|tempted a regeneration of con&s;titutions on a <HI>popular</HI> principle; but I have always regarded the nece&s;&s;ity which gave birth to the orders of chivalry, as a mark of <HI>di&s;grace</HI> to the times in which they were formed. They were indeed a proper remedy to the evils ari&s;ing from <HI>ferocity, &s;lavery, barbari&s;m,</HI> and <HI>ignorance;</HI> but now, when the cau&s;es no longer exi&s;t which rendered them u&s;eful, we &s;hould rather think of <HI>freeing</HI> &s;ociety of all the evils inherent in tho&s;e <HI>fal&s;e</HI> notions of honour which they have given ri&s;e to, than en|deavour to call back their &s;pirit in its full force. That enthu&s;i|a&s;tick military fire, that <HI>methodized &s;entimental barbari&s;m,</HI> which in|&s;tigates men to deprive their fellow citizens of life for <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> per|&s;onal affronts, in <HI>defiance</HI> of the laws of <HI>religion</HI> and <HI>&s;ociety,</HI> are the offsprings of chivalry, and unknown to <HI>all</HI> the nations of the <HI>ancient civilized</HI> world. But it is the <HI>&s;implicity</HI> of all <HI>ab&s;tract principles</HI> again&s;t which Mr. Burke makes an <HI>eternal</HI> war; all

the <HI>devices</HI> of pride, all the <HI>fond conceits</HI> of vanity, all the train of <HI>pompous</HI> o&s;tentation, by which <HI>naked</HI> virtue is put <HI>out</HI> of her <HI>rank,</HI> to give way to the more impo&s;ing glare of external magnificence, are repre&s;ented as u&s;eful ideas, "furni&s;hed from the wardrobe of a <HI>moral</HI> imagination, which the heart owns, and the under&s;tanding ratifies, as nece&s;&s;ary to cover the defects of our naked &s;hivering nature, and to rai&s;e it to dignity in our own e&s;timation."</P>
<P><HI>It is not,</HI> according to <HI>the&s;e</HI> ideas, recommended by Mr. Burke, that the Scripture teaches us to <HI>re&s;pect our&s;elves;</HI> and although the maxims of the &s;acred writings are exploded by all politicians as <HI>incompatible</HI> with their views, yet certainly the <HI>excellency</HI> of their pre|cepts con&s;i&s;ts in their being <HI>exactly</HI> fitted to a <HI>temporal</HI> as well as to a <HI>&s;piritual</HI> happine&s;s.

<P>As every act of the French National A&s;&s;embly is to be <HI>condemn|ed,</HI> not only in the <HI>gro&s;s,</HI> but in the <HI>detail,</HI> the addre&s;s of congratu|lation to the king on the commencement of the pre&s;ent year, comes, among others, under Mr. Burke's &s;evere animadver&s;ion.</P>
<P>I have not indeed got this addre&s;s by me; but if my memory does not deceive me, it contained a language the <HI>be&s;t</HI> adapted to &s;ooth the per&s;onal afflictions of the king. Not the <HI>&s;malle&s;t</HI> hint was given, than any ill conduct in his Maje&s;ty had provoked t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> people to emancipate them&s;elves from his power; it <HI>thanke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> him for his concurrence with their wi&s;hes; it repre&s;ented their liberty as the <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> con&s;equence of their <HI>enlightened</HI> &s;pirit, not of their &s;ufferings under his admini&s;tration; and it promi&s;ed as loyal an attachment to his per&s;on, and to the di&s;tinction he held as the fir&s;t magi&s;trate of the commonwealth, as could have been exacted by the authority of which he was di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Whatever might have been held out as the o&s;ten&s;ible object of the people in their demand for the meeting of their repre&s;entatives, it certainly was intended by them to u&s;e their power, when thus ve&s;ted with a legitimate form, and endued with a capability of legi&s;lation, not only to the <HI>reformation</HI> of abu&s;es, but to the <HI>rege|neration</HI> of their con&s;titution; and thus the National A&s;&s;embly became ve&s;ted with the tru&s;t of legi&s;lation, in the <HI>highe&s;t</HI> &s;en&s;e of the word: Nor could this tru&s;t be <HI>limited</HI> or <HI>governed</HI> by any of tho&s;e rules and practices, which, for <HI>rea&s;ons</HI> drawn from <HI>experience,</HI> the people <HI>condemned,</HI> and were <HI>determined to aboli&s;h.</HI></P>

Thus the pre&s;erving the &s;tate from the ruin of an impending bankruptcy, <HI>brought on</HI> by the <HI>prodigality</HI> of courts, and the <HI>rege|neration</HI> of the con&s;titution, were the important &s;ervices which the National A&s;&s;embly were expected to perform for their con&s;titu|ents.

<P>A total reformation in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;y&s;tem, and the new modelling the &s;y&s;tem of juri&s;prudence, were the <HI>two leading points</HI> in which <HI>every</HI> member of the empire agreed, excepting tho&s;e in|dividuals who&s;e intere&s;ts were per&s;onally affected by a change. It was a point of union in which both the nobility and the people met; and &s;everal of tho&s;e per&s;ons who have been the <HI>loude&s;t</HI> in their exclamations again&s;t the conduct of the National A&s;&s;embly, for having <HI>di&s;appointed</HI> their body of the large&s;t &s;hare of the <HI>&s;poils of the crown,</HI> and who have &s;ince united them&s;elves to the <HI>mal con|tents</HI> among the lawyers and the clergy, were the mo&s;t active in the fir&s;t movements of the&s;e grand points of reformation.</P>
<P>To begin with the reformation of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;y&s;tem&mdash;It was thought by the French nation, that <HI>one hundred, and four &s;core</HI> millions of property, principally confined to the u&s;e of the <HI>higher</HI> orders of the clergy, and thus prevented from entering into the common circulation of other parts of property, was a <HI>nui&s;ance</HI> in a treble &s;en&s;e. It was a <HI>nui&s;ance,</HI> in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, as a mono|poly; in the &s;econd, it was a nui&s;ance, as giving a dangerous pow|er to tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that monopoly, and in the third in|&s;tance, as it tended, by the <HI>natural cour&s;e</HI> of moral cau&s;es in this <HI>its exce&s;s,</HI> to <HI>corrupt</HI> rather than to <HI>encrea&s;e</HI> and <HI>invigorate</HI> tho&s;e <HI>qualities of the mind,</HI> and tho&s;e <HI>&s;piritual endowments,</HI> which are to be de&s;ired in the teachers of religion. What real grounds there were for this opinion, &s;o generally conceived by the French na|tion in the conduct of the clergy, I know not; neither &s;hall I en|quire, for <HI>I am as little</HI> inclined as Mr. Burke can be to in&s;ult the unfortunate: I &s;hall only &s;ay, that as their temptations were <HI>great,</HI> and that their <HI>nature</HI> was not <HI>&s;uperior</HI> to human infirmity, it was <HI>probable</HI> they produced their <HI>due</HI> effects. But there is <HI>one</HI> &s;enti|ment in which I in &s;ome mea&s;ure accord with Mr. Burke. I do
<PB N="25" REF="023517_0025_0FBFC2BE0CEB1D18">
mo&s;t &s;incerely lament that the <HI>exigencies</HI> of the times would <HI>not &s;uffer</HI> the National A&s;&s;embly to indulge their clergy in a life-en|joyment of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. But this &s;entiment of mine is not of <HI>&s;o forcible</HI> a kind as to de&s;troy <HI>all other</HI> &s;ympathies. It would not lead me, even if I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;imilar portion of abilities with Mr. Burke, like him, to <HI>endeavour,</HI> by the animating power of declamation, &s;o to condole with the &s;ufferers as to combine all the energies of the <HI>wor&s;t</HI> pa&s;&s;ions of men in favour of my opin|ion.

<P>In the <HI>attempt</HI> to make the French National A&s;&s;embly <HI>&s;ingular|ly odious,</HI> for the confi&s;cations they have made of the church lands, Mr. Burke a&s;&s;erts, that in many in&s;tances they have more violently outraged the principle, as well as the forms of publick ju&s;tice, than has been done by any other preceding power. The examples he brings in proof, are the confi&s;cations made by the fury of triumphant factions in the Roman commonwealth; and an example more in point in the per&s;on of Henry the Eighth, for Mr. Burke does <HI>not chu&s;e</HI> to extend his ob&s;ervations to the con|duct of Denmark, Sweden, and other &s;tates, on their profe&s;&s;ion of the reformed religion. Mr. Burke con&s;iders the <HI>violences</HI> of Marius and Sylla to be <HI>much graced</HI> in the formalities of <HI>fal&s;e ac|cu&s;ations of trea&s;on</HI> again&s;t the <HI>mo&s;t virtuous per&s;ons</HI> in the common|wealth; and that the tyrant Henry the Eighth, who &s;eized the property of the clergy for his own private u&s;e, and the emolu|ments of his favourites, <HI>dignified the&s;e acts of violence,</HI> by a&s;&s;uming the character of the judge, and condemning the victims on <HI>fal&s;e pretences.</HI> Surely the French clergy would not have thought them&s;elves <HI>better u&s;ed,</HI> if the National A&s;&s;embly had &s;et on foot a commi&s;&s;ion to examine into the crimes and abu&s;es which prevail|ed among them, and then to have governed their proceedings by reported truths, mixed with exaggeration and fal&s;ehood; &s;urely this <HI>mockery</HI> of ju&s;tice, <HI>&s;o much u&s;ed</HI> in old times, and this <HI>covering</HI> to the <HI>deeds</HI> of power, by <HI>&s;poils torn</HI> from the only con&s;olatory re|mains of the &s;ufferer, <HI>his good fame,</HI> will not be thought an exam|ple <HI>proper</HI> to have been followed, rather than the <HI>plain</HI> dealing of the French legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>But Mr. Burke has as great a di&s;like to the reform of the church police, as to the confi&s;cations of the property of the more
<PB N="26" REF="023517_0026_0FBFC2C17B11B058">
dignified part of the order. He is quite in a <HI>rage,</HI> that the <HI>poor curates</HI> &s;hould be taken out of the <HI>hopele&s;s poverty</HI> into which they were plunged; and he <HI>cannot endure</HI> tho&s;e regulations which took place in the <HI>be&s;t</HI> times of Chri&s;tian &s;ocieties. That bi&s;hops <HI>&s;hould be confined</HI> to their dioce&s;es, and the <HI>care</HI> of their &s;piritual admini&s;|tration, in&s;tead of attending courts, and lavi&s;hing their incomes in the plea&s;ures of the capital; and that the people &s;hould a&s;&s;ume their rights of election; "are &s;oleci&s;ms in policy, which none but <HI>barbarous, ignorant, athei&s;tical minds</HI> could dictate, and which no man of <HI>enlarged</HI> capacity and <HI>generous</HI> pa&s;&s;ions can obey."</P>
<P>On that article of the French eccle&s;ia&s;tical policy which con|fines bi&s;hops to their epi&s;copal admini&s;tration, it may not be im|proper to ob&s;erve, that Bi&s;hop Leighton, the <HI>mo&s;t eminent</HI> of the Scotch prelates for his <HI>piety</HI> and his <HI>zeal</HI> for that order, <HI>ardently wi&s;hed</HI> that &s;uch a regulation &s;hould take place on their re-e&s;tab|li&s;hment in Scotland under Charles the Second. I am far from &s;aying that &s;uch a regulation is compatible with the &s;tate of things among us; and I think &s;o well of the moderation of the clergy, and their regard to the con&s;titution of the country, that I wi&s;h they were as <HI>independent</HI> a body as Mr. Burke <HI>repre&s;ents them to be.</HI> But &s;urely if <HI>gratitude</HI> for <HI>pa&s;t favours,</HI> the <HI>hopes</HI> held out to <HI>am|bition</HI> for the acquiring <HI>further preferments,</HI> and a very con&s;idera|ble number of church-livings in the <HI>di&s;po&s;al</HI> of the crown, <HI>can in any re&s;pect</HI> influence the minds of the clergy, they cannot be &s;aid to be <HI>totally</HI> independent.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now take into con&s;ideration the &s;econd grand point of reformation, in which the nobles and people appear at fir&s;t to have been in union, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the <HI>new</HI> modelling the &s;y&s;tem of juri&s;|prudence; but that a &s;y&s;tem of juri&s;prudence, formed by <HI>ignorant barbarians,</HI> from codes of law adapted to &s;upport the <HI>de&s;potic ty|ranny</HI> of the <HI>Roman Emperors,</HI> could not be in uni&s;on with the &s;entiments of an enlightened people, or capable of &s;upporting the principles of a <HI>free</HI> government, was apparent to all parties: But per&s;onal intere&s;t, for rea&s;ons as apparent, at length produced an union between the lawyers and nobles. The National A&s;&s;embly <HI>ju&s;tly</HI> thought, that laws dictated by the <HI>humane</HI> &s;pirit of an en|lightened age, would be but <HI>ill</HI> admini&s;tered by a tribunal formed under the influence of the <HI>ranke&s;t</HI> prejudices; and they conceived it as a <HI>&s;oleci&s;m</HI> in polities, that Parliaments, who had been e&s;peci|ally appointed to &s;ee that the laws and regulations framed by the A&s;&s;emblies of the States General, &s;hould receive no injury from the edicts of the monarch, &s;hould be kept as a control over the &s;tanding authority of the nation. It was on this rea&s;on that the old independent Parliaments with all their merits, and all their faults, were aboli&s;hed. Nor is it a wonder that in the change
<PB N="27" REF="023517_0027_0FBFC2C42BB4EB48">
of the <HI>pro&s;pect,</HI> a change in the <HI>&s;entiments</HI> of the nobles &s;hould have taken place: For when they perceived that the &s;y&s;tem of the ancient tyranny was <HI>better</HI> adapted to their <HI>per&s;onal</HI> greatne&s;s than the <HI>new order</HI> of things, they with Mr. Burke, looked on the Parliaments as a <HI>convenient</HI> power, under which they might rally. What a <HI>ready convenience</HI> for the play of a <HI>delu&s;ive</HI> policy would it have afforded, if the Parliaments, exerting their <HI>old</HI> authority un|der the crown, had pertinaciou&s;ly refu&s;ed to regi&s;ter the edicts of the A&s;&s;embly! What a di&s;play of eloquence <HI>in favour</HI> of the <HI>pri|vileges</HI> of the <HI>nobles</HI> and the <HI>clergy,</HI> might have been &s;een in their <HI>remon&s;trances</HI> to the A&s;&s;embly! and what <HI>u&s;eful</HI> delays would it have afforded for the pre&s;ident of the National A&s;&s;embly, in the name of the Maje&s;ty of the people, to have been obliged to mount the Bed of <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> after the example of the late monarchs of the realm; and in ca&s;e of an <HI>incurable</HI> ob&s;tinacy, for the A&s;&s;embly, through the means of the executive power, to have recour&s;e to the <HI>tedious</HI> remedy of an impri&s;onment. With &s;uch advantages on their &s;ide, the <HI>faction</HI> in oppo&s;ition would have had <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> grounds of hope, that <HI>centuries</HI> might have elap&s;ed before the con&s;titution could have been in any &s;en&s;e of the word regen|erated.</P>
<P>Before I leave this &s;ubject, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to notice, that Mr. Burke <HI>condemns</HI> the conduct of the National A&s;&s;embly for the di&s;tinction they have made in their treatment of the lawyers and their clergy, a di&s;tinction which I think every unprejudiced per&s;on will agree to be founded in ju&s;tice, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the preference af|forded the former by making them a &s;uitable provi&s;ion during life, in con&s;ideration that the civil offices, of which they were deprived, had been purcha&s;ed with private property (as Mr. Burke ob&s;erves) "at an high rate."</P>
<P>The prevention of a national bankruptcy was thought an ob|ject of the mo&s;t <HI>momentous</HI> concern to the whole French nation. It was in order to avert this <HI>impending</HI> evil, that the States Gen|eral were permitted to a&s;&s;emble; and it was an object <HI>principally</HI> recommended to the deputies of the people, by their united voice. In this &s;tate of publick opinion, the arguments &s;o plau&s;ibly, and indeed &s;o forcibly urged by Mr. Burke <HI>again&s;t the right</HI> of the monarch to mortgage the public revenue, will not render the A&s;|&s;embly culpable for <HI>endeavouring</HI> to <HI>keep faith</HI> with the creditors of the crown. For though I never could perceive why on any <HI>good grounds of rea&s;on,</HI> the people &s;hould <HI>quarrel</HI> with their new con&s;titution, becau&s;e the <HI>prodigality</HI> of the <HI>old government</HI> had in|volved them in <HI>di&s;tre&s;&s;es</HI> which were in their nature irremoveable, which did not proceed from any <HI>fraud</HI> or <HI>corruption</HI> in their <HI>new</HI> &s;ervants, and which could not be mended by &s;ubjecting them|&s;elves
<PB N="28" REF="023517_0028_0FBFC2C520BC7670">
to the <HI>old</HI> domination; yet certain it is, that the <HI>enemies</HI> of the new con&s;titution have beheld the arrival of a moment big with that temporary di&s;tre&s;s and confu&s;ion which mu&s;t ever at|tend a national bankruptry, with the <HI>utmo&s;t impatience,</HI> as of bring|ing with it a <HI>&s;ure</HI> pro&s;pect of <HI>victory.</HI> What an <HI>opportunity</HI> indeed, would it pre&s;ent, of &s;etting forth <HI>exaggerated</HI> de&s;criptions of pub|lic di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and of arraigning the members of the National A&s;|&s;embly as the <HI>&s;ole</HI> authors of the nation's wrongs! The <HI>anxious</HI> and <HI>provident</HI> care which this A&s;&s;embly has taken to ward off this di&s;a&s;ter, and al&s;o to avoid, in the pre&s;ent irritable &s;tate of the public feelings, the impo&s;ing very heavy burthens on the people, is certainly a mark of political <HI>&s;agacity,</HI> and, <HI>being &s;uch,</HI> is treated with the <HI>utmo&s;t bitterne&s;s of di&s;appointed rage</HI> by their opponents.</P>
<P>On the &s;ubject of the difficulties which the French Legi&s;lature have encountered in the ta&s;k of regenerating the con&s;titution, it is natural to turn our minds on the <HI>paper-currency</HI> they have e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, and e&s;pecially as it is a &s;ubject on which Mr. Burke has di&s;played the <HI>whole force</HI> of his ingenuity, to alarm the fears of the French nation, and to depreciate, and to render odious in their eyes, the conduct of their repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>On this &s;ubject I do profe&s;s a total ignorance: I have no fi|nanciering abilities; and I wi&s;h with all my heart, that this art which Mr. Burke repre&s;ents as a talent the <HI>mo&s;t highly</HI> nece&s;&s;ary in tho&s;e who conduct the affairs of &s;tate, and which I con&s;ider as deriving its practical u&s;e from its <HI>deceptious</HI> addre&s;s in <HI>picking the pockets</HI> of the people, was not &s;o nece&s;&s;ary an engine in the pre&s;ent modes of admini&s;tration. A few ob&s;ervations however, which mu&s;t occur to every thinking mind, I &s;hall venture to make. They are as follows: That the difference which Mr. Burke makes between the paper currency of this country, and that which now &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in France, is not <HI>&s;o much</HI> in favour of England as Mr. Burke repre&s;ents; for, as the French legi&s;lature have <HI>not</HI> i&s;&s;ued more paper than they appear to have a <HI>&s;olid fund to &s;upport,</HI> and a fund that is <HI>obvious</HI> to every man's eyes and under&s;tanding, its credit <HI>ought not in rea&s;on</HI> to have le&s;s &s;tability than a paper cur|rency founded on <HI>confidence.</HI> For, though every man believes, and on good grounds believes, that the bank of England has a &s;ufficient property to an&s;wer for the payment of its notes; yet &s;till although <HI>this belief</HI> &s;hould ari&s;e to a <HI>moral certainty,</HI> it cannot be <HI>&s;uperior</HI> to a credit founded on an <HI>obvious</HI> fact. And &s;hould the French legi&s;lature continue this <HI>wi&s;e</HI> caution, of not i&s;&s;uing more paper than the &s;tate revenue can obviou&s;ly &s;upport, whil&s;t the revolution &s;tands on its <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> bottom, this paper, <HI>whatever may be</HI> the exigencies of the times, mu&s;t <HI>always</HI> be of <HI>&s;ome value;</HI> whereas a failure of our national credit would, it is generally
<PB N="29" REF="023517_0029_0FBFC2CA020D8728">
thought, render the paper money of this country of <HI>no more worth than the intrin&s;ic value of the paper.</HI></P>
<P>The diffu&s;ion of a general &s;pirit of gaming, and the de&s;tructive practice of &s;tock jobbing, <HI>are evils</HI> which I am a fraid in a more or le&s;s degree mu&s;t ever exi&s;t with national debts; and the <HI>larger</HI> the debt, the <HI>greater</HI> will be <HI>the degree</HI> of evil. That this &s;pirit prevails in our capital to a very alarming height, the hi&s;tory of the <HI>Bulls</HI> and <HI>Bears</HI> in the alley will <HI>abundantly</HI> te&s;tify: That it has been the <HI>ruin</HI> of many a fair fortune, <HI>thou&s;ands of &s;ufferers</HI> can al&s;o te&s;tify: That it has <HI>enabled</HI> and <HI>tempted &s;everal</HI> of tho&s;e who are in the <HI>&s;ecret</HI> of affairs, to <HI>pillage</HI> the publick unmercifully, &s;ame repre&s;ents; and that the &s;tocks have a <HI>great</HI> influence over the landed property of this country, which ri&s;es or falls according to their various fluctuations, the experience of the la&s;t American war <HI>evinces beyond a doubt.</HI></P>
<P>All the&s;e evils, if evils they are, were <HI>progno&s;ticated</HI> by tho&s;e who &s;tiled them&s;elves the patriots of their country, from the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> e&s;tab|li&s;hment of a funded debt, to almo&s;t the pre&s;ent period of time; and the rea&s;ons they urged to enforce the arguments they u&s;ed a|gain&s;t the mea&s;ure, appear to me &s;ufficiently convincing to have induced a <HI>cautious moderation</HI> in our councils. But they were not attended to; they were repre&s;ented as the <HI>chimeras of di&s;contented &s;peculative men;</HI> the <HI>encrea&s;e</HI> of the national debt was &s;et forth as both the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> and the <HI>effects</HI> of public <HI>pro&s;perity;</HI> it was de&s;cribed as the <HI>enlivening</HI> principle of commerce, the <HI>grand pan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ea</HI> that was to keep us in an <HI>eternal vigour,</HI> the <HI>&s;teady hold</HI> by which all the members of the community were to be <HI>bound</HI> in the bands of loyalty; and that there was <HI>no exce&s;s</HI> in the amount of the debt, that could be attended with <HI>any ruinous</HI> con&s;equences.</P>
<P>If &s;uch repre&s;entations, &s;o repeatedly made by a large party in the kingdom, and at pre&s;ent &s;o generally adopted, are founded in truth, I cannot &s;ee how <HI>cau&s;es</HI> which have a <HI>&s;alutary effect</HI> among us, &s;hould operate as <HI>poi&s;on</HI> to our neighbours; and I have a <HI>bet|ter</HI> opinion of the policy of the National A&s;&s;embly in i&s;&s;uing their <HI>a&s;&s;ignats,</HI> from the <HI>&s;trong</HI> and <HI>violent oppo&s;ition</HI> which was made to the mea&s;ure by their <HI>enemies.</HI></P>
<P>It mu&s;t not be forgot, that among the other economical re|gulations of the National A&s;&s;embly, that which has taken place in their <HI>li&s;t</HI> of <HI>pen&s;ioners,</HI> falls equally with other of their acts, un|der the &s;everity of Mr. Burke's pen. The amount of the public money given to this de&s;cription of people by the court, was in|deed <HI>enormous;</HI> and if we may give credit to the <HI>Red Book,</HI> pub|li&s;hed by authority, there was <HI>little</HI> of the principles of <HI>rea&s;on</HI> or <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> in the admea&s;urement of rewards to individuals, unle&s;s the <HI>&s;tate</HI> and the <HI>country</HI> are con&s;idered as <HI>&s;eparate intere&s;ts</HI> in the ac|count;

and that the plea&s;ing or gratifying the <HI>prince</HI> and his <HI>favourites</HI> &s;hould be reckoned in the value of an <HI>hundred pounds</HI> to a <HI>penny,</HI> when &s;et in the balance of <HI>blood &s;hed</HI> in <HI>defence</HI> of the <HI>nation.</HI></P>
<P>What indeed can e&s;cape Mr. Burke's cen&s;ure, or what act of the French legi&s;lature can plea&s;e him, (but the di&s;&s;olving them|&s;elves, and leaving the king and the nobles to form their own rules of power), when he finds &s;ubject for <HI>reproach</HI> even in their acts of <HI>&s;ympathy</HI> to the <HI>indigent</HI> part of the <HI>citizens?</HI> That Paris was always crowded with a numerous herd of mendicants, even more numerous, if po&s;&s;ible, than tho&s;e who infe&s;t and di&s;grace our capital, is certain; and &s;hould their numbers have encrea&s;ed by the de&s;ertion of tho&s;e opulent citizens who are out of temper with the government, it would neither be a <HI>&s;urprizing</HI> nor an <HI>alarming</HI> circum&s;tance: But it is an evil that time alone can cure, when the &s;hock of &s;o important a revolution has &s;pent its force, and when the <HI>ill humour</HI> which at pre&s;ent rages in the brea&s;ts of the di&s;contented &s;hall &s;ub&s;ide, and lead them to return into the bo&s;om of their country, and under the protecting laws of a regular gov|ernment.</P>
<P>In a very elaborate defence of all the artificial modes of great|ne&s;s which have taken place in &s;ociety, Mr. Burke has u&s;ed all the powers of eloquence and &s;ubtlety to prove, that the crimes which have been committed by our &s;pecies, have not ari&s;en from the imperfections of in&s;titutions, but from the vices of individu|als. In <HI>one &s;en&s;e,</HI> his argument will be found to be <HI>ju&s;t,</HI> in <HI>a|nother, nugatory:</HI> For though it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that the crimes committed by Nero proceeded from the depravity of his character, yet the <HI>opportunity</HI> of committing tho&s;e crimes, and per|haps that very <HI>depravity</HI> of &s;entiment from whence they proceed|ed, lay in the <HI>vice</HI> of the <HI>imperial in&s;titution.</HI></P>
<P>With the &s;ame flow of eloquence, and the &s;ame &s;ubtlety, Mr. Burke recommends in all legi&s;lators, that <HI>tardy</HI> caution which &s;uf|fers the <HI>&s;pirit of reform to evaporate</HI> before their work is half fini&s;h|ed; "for the evils latent in the mo&s;t promi&s;ing contrivances," &s;ays Mr. Burke, "&s;hould be provided for as they ari&s;e; one ad|vantage is as little as po&s;&s;ible to be &s;acrificed to another; for thus we compen&s;ate, we reconcile, we balance, we are enabled to unite in a con&s;i&s;tant whole, the various anomalies and contending prin|ciples that are found in the minds and affairs of men."</P>
<P>This <HI>finely</HI> imagined theory would undoubtedly be adopted by all wi&s;e and good legi&s;lators, did it in any manner &s;uit with the <HI>nature</HI> of mankind, and that <HI>leaven</HI> of <HI>&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s</HI> which taints <HI>every principle</HI> of human conduct. That perfect knowledge of human affairs, which Mr. Burke conceives, and ju&s;tly conceives, ought to be in&s;eparable from the office of legi&s;lation, will convince men,
<PB N="31" REF="023517_0031_0FBFC2CE2F073710">
that when new con&s;titutions are to be formed, it is nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould, in their formation, be regulated in all their circum&s;tances by tho&s;e principles which the legi&s;lators conceive to be <HI>the be&s;t;</HI> for if any thing which may be thought <HI>defective</HI> is left for the wi&s;|dom of future legi&s;lators to <HI>correct,</HI> the con&s;titution mu&s;t <HI>remain defective,</HI> as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uture reformers will find their <HI>difficulties encrea&s;e,</HI> in|&s;tead of being <HI>dimini&s;hed,</HI> by time. The rea&s;on is plain; for that which con&s;titutes the <HI>defects</HI> in all governments, are tho&s;e princi|ples in them which &s;upport a <HI>partial intere&s;t,</HI> to the injury of a <HI>public one;</HI> and the <HI>pre&s;cription of time</HI> with the <HI>politic u&s;e of power,</HI> has been found an <HI>irre&s;i&s;tible barrier</HI> to every important part <HI>of re|formation</HI> in the ordinary cour&s;e of things.</P>
<P>The French legi&s;lature, in order to extingui&s;h tho&s;e local pre|judices and provincial jealou&s;ies which formerly exi&s;ted in the kingdom of France, ari&s;ing from the different laws and cu&s;toms which took place when the independent principalities were annex|ed to the crown; and al&s;o to regulate the rights of election in &s;uch a manner, as whil&s;t it &s;ecured to the citizens at large this invalu|able ble&s;&s;ing, it &s;hould provide for the public tranquillity; con|ceived and executed a plan of dividing the kingdom into eighty one departments. Each of the&s;e departments are divided into &s;maller di&s;tricts, called <HI>Communes;</HI> and the&s;e again into &s;maller di&s;tricts, called <HI>Cantons.</HI> The primary a&s;&s;emblies of the <HI>cantons</HI> elect deputies to the <HI>communes,</HI> one for every two hundred qualified inhabitants. The <HI>communes</HI> cho&s;en by the <HI>cantons</HI> chu&s;e to the <HI>departments,</HI> and the deputies of the <HI>departments</HI> chu&s;e the deputies to the <HI>National A&s;&s;embly.</HI> A qualification to the right of election in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, is placed at the low rate of the price of three days labour; the qualification of being elected into the <HI>Commune,</HI> is the amount of ten days labour; and that of being elected a deputy to the <HI>National A&s;&s;embly,</HI> is only <HI>one</HI> mark of &s;ilver.</P>
<P>This plan, in theory at lea&s;t, promi&s;es to unite the highe&s;t de|gree of <HI>freedom</HI> with the highe&s;t degree of <HI>order:</HI> it extends the right of election <HI>to every man who is not a pauper,</HI> and as &s;uch by living on the <HI>alms</HI> of &s;ociety, cannot rea&s;onably have a <HI>right</HI> to enjoy its po|litical privileges; and whil&s;t it thus encourages indu&s;try, by ren|dering it a nece&s;&s;ary quality to enjoy the&s;e privileges, it opens the door to every man of ability to obtain the highe&s;t honours of his country. But this plan, &s;o plau&s;ible at lea&s;t in its appearance, and &s;o exactly agreeing with the rights of the citizens in the <HI>&s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e</HI> of the word, is critici&s;ed by Mr. Burke in a manner <HI>highly unworthy</HI> of his great abilities, becau&s;e he de&s;cends to the <HI>arts</HI> of a quibbling &s;ophi&s;try. He accu&s;es the legi&s;lature of not attending to their avowed principles of the equal rights of men, in <HI>refu&s;ing</HI> their <HI>paupers</HI> a vote. He a&s;&s;erts that the right of election granted
<PB N="32" REF="023517_0032_0FBFC2D066123F10">
in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, is no previlege at all; and he fore&s;ees, that the mo&s;t <HI>fatal di&s;&s;en&s;ions</HI> will ari&s;e from regulations which &s;eem|ingly tend to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"></HI> every jarring principle in the &s;tate, to &s;ub|due every prejudice of the mind ho&s;tile to the publick welfare, and to combine all its affections in the character of a loyal ci|tizen.</P>
<P>In oppo&s;ition to Mr. Burke's accu&s;ation, that the legi&s;lature, in the qualifications they have annexed to the rights of election, have acted in contradiction to their avowed principles of the e|qual rights of men, I &s;hall, without &s;heltering my&s;elf under the cover of a practical u&s;e, (which may be u&s;ed to ju&s;tify every mode of tyranny,) a&s;&s;ert, that the French legi&s;lature have in tho&s;e quali|fications adhered to the rights of men in the <HI>&s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e,</HI> even as they exi&s;t in their <HI>ab&s;tract</HI> perfection in a &s;tate of nature: For, who ever conceived, that, in a &s;tate of nature, a man who was either not inclined, or by bodily infirmity not able, to till the ground, had a right to the fruits produced by the labour of oth|ers? In this ca&s;e, either in a &s;tate of nature, or in a &s;tate of &s;oci|ety, the <HI>right</HI> of maintenance depends alone on the <HI>laws of human|ity,</HI> proceeding from that &s;ympathy which the benevolent Author of our being has for the <HI>be&s;t purpo&s;es</HI> woven into the mental con|&s;titution of all his <HI>moral</HI> creatures. But the&s;e laws of humanity do not oblige men to yield rights with the <HI>donation of alms,</HI> and to put tho&s;e whom their charity has relieved, into a &s;ituation of <HI>forcing</HI> from them the fruits of their indu&s;try. It is on the ba&s;is of <HI>indu&s;try</HI> alone, the <HI>only</HI> principle which exactly &s;quares with a native right, and <HI>not on rent-rolls,</HI> that the legi&s;lature has formed the rights of repre&s;entation; and this on &s;uch liberal principles, that every man who has activity and indu&s;try, may qualify him|&s;elf as to the matter of property, for a &s;eat in the legi&s;lative a&s;&s;em|bly. As to the nature and operation of the privileges annexed to the fir&s;t and &s;econd &s;teps in the gradation, I conceive that the regular degrees, which directly point to the grand privilege of chu&s;ing the repre&s;entatives, whil&s;t they totally prevent <HI>confu&s;ion</HI> and the errors of a <HI>blind</HI> choice, do not, in <HI>any</HI> re&s;pect, render <HI>nu|gatory</HI> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight of its more <HI>ab&s;tract</HI> principle. For every man in the Canton makes <HI>his choice</HI> of a deputy whom he thinks qualified by merit to repre&s;ent him in the Commune, and <HI>every</HI> voter in the Commune has al&s;o <HI>his choice</HI> of a deputy to pre&s;ent him in the department, who have a right to the choice of repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>As Mr. Burke has made it a point to object to <HI>every</HI> part of the French con&s;titution as it now &s;tands, and to every act of the le|gi&s;lature which re&s;pects this con&s;titution, I mu&s;t follow him through all his objections, and &s;tate tho&s;e rea&s;ons which appear to me to have regulated their conduct. It is true that a &s;enate, or
<PB N="33" REF="023517_0033_0FBFC2D1E4CABF38">
an a&s;&s;embly of men who have had &s;ome control over the voice of the people, &s;ome power of mitigating, regulating, or carrying into execution their laws, has always had a place in the ancient republics: But Mr. Burke him&s;elf &s;eems to allow, that they are not <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> nece&s;&s;ary in monarchies, or rather in any govern|ment which admits of a <HI>&s;tanding permanent</HI> executive power. It is true they appear to have been a nece&s;&s;ary in&s;titution in the an|cient republics; yet hi&s;tory will &s;hew us, that their tendency has ever been <HI>ho&s;tile</HI> to the principles of democracy, and often ended in the <HI>ruin</HI> of freedom. To the <HI>pride,</HI> the <HI>avarice,</HI> and <HI>corruption</HI> of the Roman Senate, was undoubtedly owing the &s;ubver&s;ion of the republic. It is, I think, very little to the purpo&s;e of enlight|ening men's minds on the &s;ubject of modern government, to quote the reflections of ancient authors, or draw compari&s;ons from ancient times, which were totally unacquainted with that <HI>excellent</HI> policy, by which the people's power is repre&s;ented, and brought into regular action through the means of deputation. An A&s;&s;embly of men <HI>thus appointed,</HI> &s;eems to unite in it all the energy and fitne&s;s to the affairs of government of the Roman Senate, in its mo&s;t brilliant and perfect &s;tate, without the <HI>latent</HI> principles of <HI>corruption</HI> and <HI>de&s;truction</HI> which lurked in this in&s;ti|tution.</P>
<P>What Lord Bolingbroke could mean I know not, when he &s;ays, that he prefers a monarchy to other governments; becau&s;e every de&s;cription of a republic can be better engrafted on it, than any thing of a monarchy upon the republican forms; unle&s;s he refers to &s;uch a <HI>qualified</HI> monarchy as is confined to the <HI>mere</HI> office of an executive governor, with the <HI>&s;tability</HI> that is annex|ed to <HI>hereditary de&s;cent;</HI> for &s;ure it is <HI>impo&s;&s;ible</HI> to engraft a demo|cracy on any other de&s;cription of monarchy. If this is his Lord|&s;hip's meaning, the French monarchy, as it now &s;tands, will be found to agree <HI>perfectly</HI> with it; and &s;hould experience prove it to be defective for the want of &s;uch a member as a &s;enate, the defect mu&s;t be &s;upplied with all tho&s;e <HI>cautious</HI> preventatives which experience can alone afford.</P>
<P>The <HI>limitations</HI> of power, in which the executive magi&s;trate is confined, affords Mr. Burke a &s;ubject for the exertion of <HI>all</HI> the powers of his oratory. He <HI>deplores</HI> the mortified &s;tate of the fal|len monarch; he &s;ees nothing but <HI>weakne&s;s</HI> in the government, and <HI>confu&s;ion</HI> in the affairs of the empire; from the want of a <HI>proper influencing power in the executive, and that cordiality which ought to &s;ub&s;i&s;t between it and the legi&s;lative.</HI> He conceives, that without &s;uch a <HI>controling</HI> influence, the executive office is a &s;tate of <HI>degradation,</HI> to which <HI>no man of &s;pirit</HI> would &s;ubmit. And if the pre&s;ent King and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors re&s;pect their <HI>true</HI> glory, they
<PB N="34" REF="023517_0034_0FBFC2D52A576E88">
will take <HI>every</HI> opportunity which time may pre&s;ent, of &s;haking off the yoke of their imperious ma&s;ters, and re&s;uming their former independence.</P>
<P>To the&s;e animadver&s;ions of Mr. Burke, it may be ob&s;erved, that mo&s;t of the limitations of which he complains, are either <HI>in&s;eparable</HI> to the &s;ecurity of the democracy, or they have their grounds in a <HI>ju&s;t policy,</HI> &s;uiting it&s;elf to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things. It is nece&s;&s;ary that a popular legi&s;lature &s;hould be informed through <HI>other channels</HI> than the <HI>executive power,</HI> of &s;uch matters as may im|port that body to know: It is nece&s;&s;ary that all the means by which <HI>a per&s;onal influence</HI> may be e&s;tabli&s;hed by the <HI>grant of lands</HI> and <HI>large pen&s;ions,</HI> &s;hould be taken away; and for the &s;ame rea|&s;ons of policy, it is nece&s;&s;ary that the executive power <HI>&s;hould not</HI> be capable of <HI>deluding the imaginations</HI> of men, by creating <HI>artifi|cial di&s;tinctions</HI> among them.</P>
<P>According to Mr. Burke's political creed, Kings are only to <HI>re|&s;pect tho&s;e</HI> who &s;erve their <HI>per&s;onal greatne&s;s;</HI> and it is his opinion, that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to the throne of France in the Bourbon line, <HI>mu&s;t,</HI> unle&s;s they are <HI>illiterate men,</HI> act on a principle <HI>ho&s;tile</HI> to the con&s;titution which <HI>they are &s;worn</HI> to pre&s;erve. It is true, as Mr. Burke ob&s;erves, this is <HI>nature;</HI> but are not tho&s;e very <HI>inclinations,</HI> &s;o inherent in man, the grounds for that <HI>jealou&s;y</HI> which reflecting patriots entertain <HI>of all per&s;ons</HI> ve&s;ted with the dangerous gift of <HI>permanent</HI> authority? And unle&s;s the pre&s;ent monarch of France, and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, &s;hall conceive <HI>very different ideas of glory</HI> than they will <HI>learn</HI> from Mr. Burke; unle&s;s they &s;hall conceive that the executing an office <HI>faithfully,</HI> reflects <HI>more honour</HI> upon them than any encrea&s;e of <HI>per&s;onal greatne&s;s</HI> they can gain by <HI>treachery;</HI> there is very little probability that they will obtain from a popu|lar legi&s;lature, that enlargement of power<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The exerci&s;e of the &s;u&s;pen&s;ive <HI>Veto.</HI></NOTE> which may rea&s;ona|bly be given, when circum&s;tances &s;hall <HI>convince</HI> the public mind that there are no grounds for jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke extends his <HI>commi&s;eration not only</HI> to the per&s;on of the King and his royal i&s;&s;ue, but <HI>even</HI> to the mini&s;ters of the crown in their civil capacity. In this commi&s;eration, he <HI>reprobates</HI> a principle which is held out to the people of Great Britain as the grand <HI>palladium</HI> of their liberties, I mean the principle of re&s;pon|&s;ibility; though the reprobation is indeed qualified by a di&s;tinc|tion of <HI>active</HI> and <HI>zealous</HI> &s;ervice, and the re&s;traint of crimes. But it is a di&s;tinction which I cannot well under&s;tand; for if re&s;pon|&s;ibility does not go to every part of a mini&s;ter's conduct, in which he acts without due authority, it is indeed a <HI>very</HI> &s;light con&s;titu|tional barrier again&s;t the <HI>vices</HI> of admini&s;tration, e&s;pecially when it is allowed among the prerogatives of our Kings, that they may
<PB N="35" REF="023517_0035_0FBFC2D9BAA09738">
chu&s;e their own &s;ervants, and retain them in their office at plea|&s;ure: but will any mini&s;ter who &s;erves &s;uch a King (&s;ays Mr. Burke, when &s;peaking of the pre&s;ent King of France) with but a decent appearance of re&s;pect, <HI>cordially</HI> obey the orders of tho&s;e whom but the other day in his name they had committed to the Ba&s;tile? Will they obey the orders of tho&s;e whom, whil&s;t they were exerci&s;ing <HI>de&s;potick ju&s;tice</HI> upon them, they conceived they were treating with <HI>lenity,</HI> and for whom, in a <HI>pri&s;on,</HI> they thought they had provided an <HI>a&s;ylum.</HI></P>
<P>This is &s;aying <HI>very little,</HI> either for the di&s;po&s;ition of the min|i&s;ters, or for the <HI>&s;pirit</HI> and <HI>principles</HI> of the ancient government. Nor can I &s;ee that the&s;e gentlemen have any <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> complaints to make again&s;t the conduct of the French legi&s;lature. It is true they are denied a &s;eat among&s;t them; but this exception is not made on any <HI>per&s;onal</HI> ground: They do not except again&s;t the abilities of the&s;e gentlemen, or their hone&s;ty as individuals; but they will <HI>not</HI> permit, either a <HI>real,</HI> or a <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed influence,</HI> to con|trol their own actions. They will not permit that the &s;anctuary, in which the Maje&s;ty of the people of France re&s;ides, &s;hould be <HI>polluted</HI> or <HI>impeached</HI> by any <HI>&s;u&s;picion of corruption;</HI> and they will not endanger the liberties of their country, by giving <HI>ab&s;olute pow|er any motive,</HI> which, in the event of things, may po&s;&s;ibly tend to an <HI>abu&s;e</HI> of <HI>tru&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The opinion which Mr. Burke endeavours to e&s;tabli&s;h in his elaborate Reflections on the French Revolution, is the <HI>incompat|ibility</HI> of a truly popular government with the human con&s;titu|tion: And the &s;ubject which affords him the mo&s;t ample &s;cope for the di&s;play of his argumentative powers, is found in the in|ve&s;tment of that military force which is nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;upport of all governments; for if that force is tru&s;ted to the people at large, they may be tempted to act in their natural capacity, and, by de|&s;troying or weakening the energy of tho&s;e organs by which regu|lar councils are held and enforced, induce a &s;tate of anarchy. And if the &s;upport of the government is made to &s;ub&s;i&s;t in a reg|ular &s;tanding di&s;ciplined body, under the control of an individ|ual, that individual will become the <HI>ma&s;ter of the people,</HI> and <HI>vio|late</HI> the government he was appointed to <HI>defend.</HI></P>
<P>Either the e&s;tabli&s;hment or the overthrow of an opinion &s;o fa|tal to the proud hopes of man, mu&s;t be left to time and experi|ence; for I am &s;orry to &s;ay, that we have no notices on which we can attempt the con&s;truction of an oppo&s;ite argument. We cannot venture to e&s;tabli&s;h an opinion on the &s;tate of a country not yet recovered from the convul&s;ive &s;truggles which every im|portant revolution mu&s;t occa&s;ion. We can gain no light from

Some at|tempts indeed have been made of this kind; but they have hith|erto failed, through the <HI>treachery</HI> of leaders, or by the <HI>ra&s;h folly</HI> of the multitude. But though the&s;e circum&s;tances will prevent cautious per&s;ons from giving a <HI>decided</HI> opinion on what may be the event of things, yet they do not &s;o <HI>benight</HI> the under&s;tanding as to deprive the mind of hope. They do not prevent it from &s;eeing that the pre&s;ent complexion of things in France has &s;ome|thing of a different a&s;pect from what hi&s;tory, or the &s;tate of other countries, pre&s;ents to our view. In&s;tead of that <HI>barbarous ignor|ance,</HI> or that <HI>depravity</HI> of <HI>principle,</HI> which are to be &s;een in other European States, and which might rea&s;onably prevent the patriot from be&s;towing (if it were in his power) the full boon of liberty, we &s;ee a people <HI>firm</HI> and <HI>united</HI> in their efforts to <HI>&s;upport</HI> their rights, yet obedient<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> Mr. Burke acknowledges this obedience, and calls it <HI>fanatici&s;m.</HI></NOTE> to the dictates of that government which they have appointed to defend them.</P>
<P>From what can this difference which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the French nation and other &s;ocieties ari&s;e, but in a more <HI>general</HI> dif|fu&s;ion of <HI>knowledge,</HI> and in a principle of action which con&s;ults the <HI>public</HI> good, as well as the gratifications of <HI>&s;elf?</HI> It is the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of <HI>knowledge</HI> to teach men their <HI>real intere&s;ts;</HI> and it is to be hoped it will &s;o far prevail over that <HI>mi&s;t</HI> which <HI>inordinate</HI> affec|tions ca&s;t over the mind, as to enable the French municipalities to &s;ee, that if they &s;o far <HI>abu&s;e</HI> the power with which they have been inve&s;ted for the defence of their rights, as to gratify a <HI>private</HI> pa&s;&s;ion at the expen&s;e of the <HI>public</HI> peace, they will induce a <HI>nece&s;&s;i|ty</HI> which will lead to their <HI>utter</HI> de&s;truction. It is to be hoped al&s;o, that a <HI>true</HI> &s;en&s;e of intere&s;t will enable the army to perceive, that the <HI>moment they fling off the character of the citizen, and a&s;&s;ume a con|troling power over their country,</HI> from that moment they become <HI>individually &s;laves;</HI> for the very circum&s;tance in their condition by which this power mu&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;t, is a di&s;cipline in&s;eparable to the <HI>&s;tricte&s;t &s;ubordination,</HI> and which in <HI>all</HI> re&s;pects mu&s;t militate again&s;t their civil rights. When the Roman army was in the very height of their power; when it was enabled to depo&s;e and murder em|perors, and rai&s;e private men to the imperial throne; when they were enabled to ravage the empire at their plea&s;ure, and exact lar|ge&s;&s;es from its &s;poils; they were, in an <HI>individual</HI> capacity, the <HI>greate&s;t</HI> of &s;laves.</P>
<P>The patriot Frenchman has a pro&s;pect of hope which <HI>never</HI> yet

offered it&s;elf to the view of &s;ociety, and that is in the <HI>di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s</HI> of tho&s;e councils to which he has confided his right. The repub|lican parliament of England, by their <HI>inordinate</HI> thir&s;t after public offices, and by u&s;ing their power to their <HI>own emolument,</HI> gave <HI>too much room</HI> for the &s;u&s;picions of a divided people to act in their disfavour; and it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that the intere&s;ts of &s;elf have been ob&s;erved to act as much in popular councils as in courts. But the French legi&s;lature have &s;et, in this point, an example <HI>un|parellelled</HI> in the hi&s;tory of man. To a <HI>bold</HI> and <HI>enterpri&s;ing</HI> &s;pirit, they have united a <HI>di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s</HI> of principle which has deprived their enemies of <HI>every</HI> means of oppo&s;ition, but <HI>vain</HI> declamation, <HI>groundle&s;s</HI> accu&s;ation, and <HI>impotent</HI> hope. Long may they con|tinue the <HI>admiration</HI> of the world in the&s;e important particulars! Long may they thus continue to <HI>aggrandize</HI> the character of man! And long may they continue to de&s;erve a <HI>monument of e&s;teem</HI> on the minds of their &s;pecies, which neither <HI>time,</HI> nor <HI>accident,</HI> nor <HI>adver&s;e fortune, &s;hall be able to efface!</HI></P>
<P>It cannot be denied that Mr. Burke has made a di&s;play of very <HI>uncommon</HI> abilities in his attack on the French Revolution; but why has he deigned to make u&s;e of the <HI>mean arts</HI> of abu&s;e as an <HI>auxiliary</HI> in the conte&s;t? Why has he, by the mo&s;t <HI>invidious</HI> com|pari&s;ons, and <HI>groundle&s;s</HI> accu&s;ations, endeavoured, to rou&s;e all na|tions and all de&s;criptions of men again&s;t them, and thus to <HI>cru&s;h in their ruin all the rights of man?</HI> Is the tendency of his publica|tion a <HI>recommendation</HI> to the Briti&s;h government, to dragoon their neighbours into an adoption of their own &s;y&s;tem of policy? Would he recommend to the potentates of Europe, a renewal of that <HI>wicked con&s;piracy</HI> again&s;t the rights of men, which was plan|ned by Henry the fourth and his mini&s;ter Sully, and which was only prevented from taking place by the timely death of that monarch?&mdash;a plan, by which, through the <HI>combination</HI> of power, modes of government were to be <HI>arbitrarily</HI> impo&s;ed and &s;up|ported, and the rights of con&s;cience <HI>aboli&s;hed.</HI> If &s;uch <HI>violent</HI> councils were indeed to take place of that <HI>moderation</HI> and <HI>equity</HI> which has hitherto been &s;hewn, it would <HI>prove</HI> that the <HI>forming treaties</HI> and directing the <HI>force of nations</HI> were but <HI>ill</HI> tru&s;ted to the <HI>&s;ecrecy</HI> of cabinets. When we reflect that &s;uch dreadful purpo&s;es can never be effected without the effu&s;ion of <HI>oceans</HI> of blood, of &s;uch an invidious intention we mu&s;t certainly exculpate Mr. Burke; unle&s;s, by a <HI>&s;trange</HI> modification of <HI>&s;ympathy,</HI> the lives of plebeians, and tho&s;e vulgar characters which compo&s;e the <HI>"&s;win|i&s;h multitude,"</HI> is held at <HI>no value</HI> in his account. Some of Mr. Burke's expre&s;&s;ions, indeed, &s;eem to warrant us in making &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition, though we <HI>mu&s;t acknowledge,</HI> that, in others,
<PB N="38" REF="023517_0038_0FBFC2E55C81E9A0">
he appears to have a <HI>concern</HI> for the <HI>&s;piritual,</HI> if not for the <HI>temporal</HI> happine&s;s of tho&s;e he de&s;pi&s;es: "Whil&s;t, &s;ays he, the wealth and pride of individuals at every moment makes the man of humble rank and fortune &s;en&s;ible of his inferiority, and <HI>de|grades</HI> and <HI>vilifies</HI> his condition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is a &s;ad condition, indeed, for <HI>"naked &s;hivering nature:"</HI> But what is the remedy? why, let them re&s;pect property, and &s;eek "their con|&s;olation in the final proportions of eternal ju&s;tice." <HI>Vide</HI> Reflections, pages 147 and 351.</NOTE>; it is for the man in humble life, and to rai&s;e his nature, and to put him in mind of a &s;tate in which the privileges of opulence will cea&s;e, when he will be e|qual by nature, and may be more than equal by virtue, that this portion of the general wealth of his country is employed, and &s;anctified."</P>
<P>If Mr. Burke, in the management of his argument, could have de&s;cended from the <HI>lofty</HI> &s;train of a <HI>poetic</HI> imagination, to the <HI>drud|gery</HI> of clo&s;e rea&s;oning, he would have perceived the <HI>error</HI> of de|viating from the line of <HI>expediency</HI> into the que&s;tion of <HI>right;</HI> for when we once <HI>give up</HI> the point, that there is an <HI>inherent</HI> right attached to privileged per&s;ons to make laws for the community, we cannot fix on any other principle that will &s;tand the te&s;t of argument, but the <HI>native</HI> and <HI>unalienable</HI> rights of man. For if we &s;ay that <HI>lawful</HI> governments are formed on the authority of conventions, it will be a&s;ked, <HI>who gave the&s;e conventions their au|thority?</HI> If we grant that they derived their authority from the <HI>a&s;&s;ent of the people,</HI> how came the people, it will be &s;aid, to exert &s;uch an authority at <HI>one</HI> period of &s;ociety, and not at <HI>another?</HI> If we &s;ay it was <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> that recovered to the &s;ocial man the full rights of his nature, it will be a&s;ked, <HI>who is to be the judge</HI> of this nece&s;&s;ity? why <HI>certainly</HI> the people.</P>
<P>Thus, in <HI>every</HI> light in which we can place the argument, in every po&s;&s;ible mode of rea&s;oning, we &s;hall be driven back to elect either the fir&s;t or the &s;econd of the&s;e propo&s;itions; either that an individual, or &s;ome privileged per&s;ons, have an inherent and in|defea&s;ible right to make laws for the community, or that this authority re&s;ts in the unalienable and indefea&s;ible rights of man.</P>
<P>That the people have often abu&s;ed their power, it mu&s;t be granted; for they have often <HI>&s;acrificed</HI> them&s;elves and their po&s;te|rity to the <HI>wanton will</HI> of an individual, and <HI>this</HI> is the foundation of all the regal tyrannies which have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in &s;ociety; but <HI>no abu&s;e</HI> of their power can <HI>take away their right,</HI> becau&s;e their right <HI>exi&s;ts in the very con&s;titution of things.</HI> If the French people there|fore &s;hould be &s;o <HI>capricious</HI> as to fling off their new con&s;titution, and &s;ubject them&s;elves to more <HI>unequal</HI> forms of government, or

even to <HI>tyranny,</HI> it will be agreeable to the cour&s;e of pa&s;t experi|ence: But &s;uch an exertion of power <HI>cannot injure their right;</HI> and whatever form or complexion any future government in France may bear, it can have no <HI>legitimate</HI> &s;ource, <HI>but in the will of the people.</HI></P>
