<SPEAKER>Dorimant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you were guilty of very ungentel|manly-like behaviour, to abu&s;e me when you did not know I was pre&s;ent to defend my&s;elf. And &s;uppo&s;e I advi&s;ed you to marry; did not you a&s;k my advice?&mdash; Were you not charmed when I gave my advice?&mdash;Be|&s;ides, is it po&s;&s;ible you can repent?&mdash;With what on earth have you to reproach your wife?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her indi&s;cretion&mdash;which keeps me in perpetual torture.&mdash;She knows how much I feel on the occa&s;ion, and how earne&s;tly I have entreated our mar|riage might be kept &s;ecret; and yet it is her fir&s;t plea&s;ure the world &s;hould know &s;he has a hu&s;band&mdash;and that I am the unfortunate man.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorimant.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can ea&s;ily imagine your de&s;ire has not been &s;trictly complied with&mdash;but you could not, &s;urely, think to be married half your life without having it &s;ometime or other known in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>A &s;ecret alliance, formed near two years ago, without my father's con&s;ent or knowledge, would expo&s;e me to his ju&s;t re&s;entment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorimant.</SPEAKER>
<P>His re&s;entment will be ea&s;ily overcome &mdash;for his obligations to you are &s;o great&mdash;his affection for you &s;o tender&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I fear his &s;orrow, much more than his anger.&mdash;But there is another rea&s;on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorimant.</SPEAKER>
<P>That, indeed, has &s;ome weight; for you mean your uncle, the old rich contractor, who&s;e ob&s;ti|nacy and inhumanity, if he knew you had married a lady with a fortune unequal to that he means to give you, might cau&s;e him never perhaps to give you a &s;hilling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, be&s;ide the&s;e, I have another rea&s;on yet; one, which (to my own feelings) is of more con&s;equence than any.&mdash;You know I have always made a je&s;t of matrimony, laughed at, and ridiculed all hu&s;bands; I am therefore now a&s;hamed, and blu&s;h at the title&mdash;There is &s;omething in marriage that takes from the dignity&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorimant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will it take from the dignity of knight|hood, which you have gained by your learned di&s;&s;erta|tions?
<PB N="5" REF="030339_0005_0FE5C5805F33A7D8">No; nor can there be any rea&s;on but your uncle's di&s;plea&s;ure why it &s;hould be any longer con|cealed. Certainly you mu&s;t pay &s;ome attention to that; and it ought to be a weighty con&s;ideration with your lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it is, I dare &s;ay&mdash;but the plea&s;ure of telling a &s;ecret weighs heavier far.&mdash;After all, &s;he is not the only one who takes plea&s;ure in propagating the news&mdash;her &s;i&s;ter, to whom you de&s;ign your&s;elf the <HI>happy hu&s;band,</HI> has whi&s;pered the &s;ecret to mo&s;t of her acquaintance.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorimant.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am vext at &s;uch indi&s;cretion, and will go to both ladies in&s;tantly with my complaint&mdash; <STAGE>[Going, returns.]</STAGE> And now do you apply your&s;elf to &s;tudy&mdash; and employ all your knowledge to obtain that degree of patience requi&s;ite to your &s;tate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do you furni&s;h your&s;elf with ample &s;tore again&s;t you marry my &s;i&s;ter-in-law; for, by Hea|ven, you will want it all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dorimant.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know Emily well&mdash;know all her faults &mdash;But love them all&mdash;even that pride which di&s;dains me I approve; for while my unfortunate quarrel con|ceals from her my real name and family, &s;he is right in treating me &s;o lightly.&mdash;Yet that &s;he loves me, I am convinced; and, the moment my antagoni&s;t is pro|nounced out of danger, I will &s;ilence every &s;cruple, by revealing to her, that, in&s;tead of poor Dorimant, who has no other friend upon earth but you, I have a for|tune and family as much above hers, as &s;he now believes hers is above mine.</P>

<P>Entru&s;ting you with a &s;ecret, mrs. Lucy, has given you a freedom that may very &s;oon lo&s;e you your place.</P>

<P>Therefore I fear him&mdash;you know I always fear a fool&mdash;It is the fool, who laughs at the faults of wi&s;e men, becau&s;e they are &s;o unlike his own.
