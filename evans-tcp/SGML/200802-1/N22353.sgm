<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE kind reception <HI>the Plea&s;ing In&s;tructor</HI> has met with in general, &s;ince its fir&s;t publica|tion, merits the Editor's mo&s;t &s;incere and hearty thanks. In this edition, many additions and amendments are made, which, it is hoped, will meet with approbation. Several original e&s;&s;ays, by a friend, are in&s;erted, which, in the table of contents, are marked <HI>Anon. Engli&s;h</HI> mot|tos are prefixed to the e&s;&s;ays; and care has been taken to in&s;ert &s;uch <HI>only</HI> as are <HI>conci&s;e, appo&s;ite,</HI> and <HI>&s;triking,</HI> that they may have the <HI>better</HI> effect on the minds of youth.</P>
<P>The reader will be kind enough to ob&s;erve, that <HI>the Plea&s;ing In&s;tructor</HI> was at fir&s;t chiefly undertaken, and &s;ince continued, with a view to exhibit a <HI>connected plan</HI> of <HI>morality</HI> for the in&s;truction of the youth of both &s;exes, and free from that incoherent jumble &s;o remarkable in all collections of this kind which have hitherto been pub|li&s;hed. The <HI>Utile Dulci</HI> has been con&s;ulted, and <HI>morality</HI> here appears &s;miling, and free from that unplea&s;ing for|mality with which &s;he is too often di&s;gui&s;ed by partial, or mi&s;taken pedants. The &s;everal relations, Ea&s;tern &s;to|ries, dreams, &amp;c. will, it is to be hoped, be recommended to young minds, who&s;e attentions are thereby particu|larly engaged, and, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of which, <HI>morality</HI> &s;teals in&s;en&s;ibly into their good graces, and makes the mo&s;t la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion: The mo&s;t elegant writers have been con&s;ulted by the Editor; &s;o that the young reader, by being conver&s;ant with the following e&s;&s;ays, will, at the &s;ame time, acquire a true ta&s;te of an ca&s;e and ele|gance in his native tongue; an accompli&s;hment too much neglected by the teachers of youth, who &s;eldom look on it as an improvement &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary as it really is. And though the entertainment and in&s;truc|tion of youth, at an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;chool, were principally con|&s;idered in the fir&s;t publication of this book, yet the Edi|tor has had the plea&s;ure to find it &s;ince honored with the attention and approbation of tho&s;e more advanced in years, and &s;elected by the polite and judicious through-out the kingdom, in&s;omuch that it has now acquired a place in almo&s;t every parlour window.</P>

<HEAD>THOUGHTS ON EDUCATION, BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH EDUCATION be a &s;ubject that almo&s;t all Authors, of all ages, have writ|ten upon; yet many have attempted it who were &s;tran|gers, perhaps, to the mo&s;t exten&s;ive definition of the WORD; others have laid down very plau&s;ible rules and &s;y&s;tems for it, which, upon experience, have been found impracticable; while others have obliged the world with &s;uch valuable and plain plans, that any thinking man mu&s;t be apt to wonder how they &s;hould have been mi&s;&s;ed or neglected; yet the&s;e able writers have, to ignorant and undi&s;cerning pretenders, planned and planned in vain: from which it may plainly he inferred, that differ|ent pa&s;&s;ions and di&s;po&s;itions require different manage|ment and application, to &s;o endle&s;s a variety, that it is merely impo&s;&s;ible to enumerate methods for the proper correction of every enormity in every human mind, or to lay down rules for the be&s;t incitements to, and en|couragements of virtue and &s;cience; &s;o that the main point, after all their pre&s;criptions, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily cen|ter in the tutors or governors of &s;chools and &s;eminaries. Much learning and great abilities, (though material articles) are not the only e&s;&s;entials; he who has the mo&s;t learning does not always convey it in the be&s;t and cleare&s;t manner to others: &s;ome cannot or will not be at the pains to find out particular methods (where gen|eral ones fail) to render what they would communicate intelligible to the various capacities of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; nor do learning and knowledge always center in the &s;ame per&s;on. U&s;eful knowledge, or what I would have com|prehended
<PB N="v" REF="029518_0003_0FE1BA250EBA89D0">
by the word politene&s;s,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>"To define politene&s;s, we may &s;ay, it is all moral virtues in epitome: it is a combination of di&s;cretion, civility, complai&s;ance, and circum&s;pection, to pay every one the re&s;pect they have a right to demand of us; be&s;ides, an exact knowledge of decorum, and of what every one owes to his re&s;pective quality, dule to main|tain his character as becomes him. And all this mu&s;t be dre&s;&s;ed and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> off with an agreeable, and in&s;inuating air, diffu&s;ed through all our Words and actions."</HI></NOTE> is the grand mark or &s;ummit of education we &s;hould aim at; learning, as a famous author has expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, "is but the vehi|cle that carries us to it."</P>
<P>An au&s;tere or learned pedant has &s;ometimes whipped Latin, Greek, &amp;c. into a lad, who&s;e very di&s;gu&s;t to it in|crea&s;ed perhaps with the acqui&s;ition thereof: but it is a manife&s;t ab&s;urdity to maintain or imagine that any one can be awed into a love of learning and virtue. A boy is not at all cured of a fault, who only avoids it for fear of puni&s;hment: he mu&s;t be influenced by a love for honour and credit, and with a laudable ambition to pur&s;ue them: any ma&s;ter, who is him&s;elf a <HI>good</HI> and <HI>di&s;cerning</HI> man, will not be much at a lo&s;s how to confirm and ratify him in his choice, being capacitated as a good man, to com|municate to him the &s;ecret impul&s;es, the benign reflec|tions of his own hone&s;t, and therefore happy mind; as a di&s;cerning man, to ob&s;erve and remark to him what wild havoc and varied de&s;olation, vice and folly never fail to bring on their votaries; which may be clearly demon|&s;trated, either by living examples among their acquain|tances, or from books, by &s;imilar relations, allegories, or e&s;&s;ays, (&s;uch as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in&s;erted in this collection) applied at proper times on proper occa&s;ions, judiciou&s;ly explained, and wi&s;ely inculcated: But an <HI>ill</HI> man, though ever &s;o learned, can never be a good &s;choolma&s;ter; it being im|po&s;&s;ible he &s;hould, with a due &s;en&s;ibility, de&s;cribe or en|force impul&s;es of goodne&s;s he does not feel, or demon|&s;trate to others with clearne&s;s and impartiality the effects of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e vices and follies to which he him&s;elf is &s;o par|ticularly bla&s;&s;ed and attached; may, even the very be&s;t precepts and documents (could a ma&s;ter of this &s;tamp be capable of &s;uch) would fail of their due force and influ|ence from the mouth of one who&s;e own manners and di&s;|po&s;itions
<PB N="vi" REF="029518_0004_0FE1BA27986BA5E0">
are contradictions to them: Therefore a bad man, in the point of education, mu&s;t mi&s;carry, and even a good man may; for as no man ought to be well bred (if a man can be well bred) at the expence of religion and virtue; &s;o neither ought any man to practi&s;e them in &s;o moro&s;e and &s;urly a manner, as to deter others from imita|tion. I &s;hall endeavour to explain my&s;elf yet more clear|ly by the two following characters, which I &s;hall repre|&s;ent by the names of <HI>Candidus</HI> and <HI>Denuncius.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Candidus</HI> is a man of exten&s;ive learning, has an exact knowledge of human nature, a great experience of the world, and of tho&s;e differences which re&s;ult from con&s;ti|tution, age, received opinions, external fortune, education, cu&s;tom, and conver&s;ation; manages the tempers of his pupils with unde&s;cribeable artfulne&s;s, &s;o con&s;equently can adapt or addre&s;s his admonitions or in&s;tructions to the mo&s;t &s;alutary ends, be his &s;cholars ever &s;o numerous,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>By numerous, is not meant here many &s;cholars at once, but at various times; as perhaps no man can to perfection teach more than twelve or fourteen at a time.</HI></NOTE> or their di&s;po&s;itions ever &s;o various.</P>
<P>As for the qualities of his mind, he is mild, humane, affable, affectionate, and even invitingly acce&s;&s;ible; en|couraging his pupils in the di&s;play of all their little doubts, queries, and divided opinions; teaching them, at the &s;ame time, not to per&s;i&s;t in an opinion, &amp;c. becau&s;e they had once avowed it; but to come frankly into con|viction; and would frankly, with a conde&s;cending bow, &s;mile, &amp;c. thank a &s;cholar for any little officious &s;ervices or intended obligations; nay, frequently apologize, or a&s;k pardon, for any omi&s;&s;ion, mi&s;take, mi&s;apprehen&s;ion, or &s;imilar modes of behaviour; &s;uch as frequently occur among the be&s;t bred and polite; and thus by being treated as men, they become emulous of being &s;uch. Familiarities in a tyrant are ob&s;erved to beget contempt; in <HI>him</HI> re&s;pect and gratitude; for as he has not even a thought that is ambitious, wrong, or malicious, he never was or can be &s;een by them in a little, mean, or ridicu|lous light; but his whole conduct is the living object of their imitation. Thus, as his character is uniform, his temper &s;erene and &s;teady, the influence acquired in his &s;chool is unlimited: he applauds with &s;o much plea&s;ure,

<PB N="vii" REF="029518_0004_0FE1BA27986BA5E0">
and reproves with &s;o much tender concern and affec|tion, that they love him as a parent. So con&s;tantly de|vout and fervent in the duties of religion and morality, that they reverence him as a &s;aint, and con&s;ider him as a Mentor: they are awed by his virtues, not by his &s;ever|ities; and by a con&s;tant attention to his doctrine, exem|plified in his own life, his pupils frequently acquire "&s;uch a conviction of the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of a Deity to all their thoughts, that every inordinate wi&s;h becomes &s;e|cretly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by the mo&s;t &s;crupulous circum&s;pection."</P>
<P>Such is the amiable <HI>Candidus,</HI> and &s;uch the engaging and &s;ucce&s;sful methods he makes u&s;e of,
<Q><L>&mdash;To rear the tender thought,</L>
<L>To teach the young idea how to &s;hoot,</L>
<L>To pour the fre&s;h in&s;tructions o'er the mind,</L>
<L>To breathe th' enliv'ning &s;pirit, and to fix</L>
<L>The gen'rous purpo&s;e in the glowing brea&s;t.</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Denuncius</HI> too is a man of learning, but not &s;o remark|able for his learning as the o&s;tentation of it: therefore knowledge he cannot have much of, becau&s;e if he had, he would &s;ee &s;o much weakne&s;s even in the perfection of human rea&s;on, that he would in con&s;equence de&s;pi&s;e, not be proud of, his own mi&s;erable pittance: watching and a&s;&s;i&s;ting the openings of little minds, enlarging their ideas, &s;owing the &s;eeds of goodne&s;s, or weeding out enor|mities, though very e&s;&s;ential points, are yet &s;uch as he is equally ignorant and unconcerned about, wanting that nece&s;&s;ary di&s;cernment to deduce the actions of men to their minute&s;t &s;ources, or to infer con&s;equences from their manners or actions; but his incapacity in this is not the lea&s;t ob&s;truction to his general acceptation, which my wi&s;e&s;t readers will, on fir&s;t thoughts, wonder at; but then let them con&s;ider, that there are hundreds of parents who can judge of a lad's advancement in founds, &s;ylla|bles, words, or languages, who are utterly incapable of di&s;cerning the enlargement of his mental faculties, and their wonder will cea&s;e. I have ob&s;erved before, that he is vain and o&s;tentatious: I &s;hould have added, pa&s;&s;ionate, pedantic, arrogant, moro&s;e, and ill-natured; the natural produce of a narrow and ignorant mind. As pa&s;&s;ionate, he frequently oppo&s;es commotion with commotion; &s;o that his &s;cholars look upon his &s;everities as revenge, or the gratification of his own conte&s;ting humour, not the
<PB N="viii" REF="029518_0005_0FE1CBAB3384E378">
nece&s;&s;ary correction of their faults. His pa&s;&s;ion too drives him to &s;uch lengths, as often &s;ubjects him to un|due conce&s;&s;ions, &s;o that he de&s;troys the authority and order of his &s;chool by his very endeavours to pre&s;erve them: in &s;hort, as his behaviour in &s;chool is exactly the rever&s;e to that of <HI>Candidus,</HI> &s;o are its effects; for <HI>Denuncius</HI> is as heartily ridiculed and de&s;pi&s;ed, as the other is rev|erenced and beloved. While their boys, though perhaps with the equal approbation of their &s;everal parents, leave their re&s;pective &s;chools with this difference, i. e. The in&s;tructions and example of <HI>Candidus</HI> having di&s;pell|ed from before his pupils the mi&s;t of ignorance, and en|abled them to &s;ee clearly and judge infallibly of the merits and demerits of good and evil, and of the natural con|&s;equences thereof, his young men are thereby enabled to guard again&s;t all incitements to the vi&s;ionary plea&s;ure of guilty life, and to &s;teer their cour&s;e with &s;ecurity and credit through the world: whereas tho&s;e of <HI>Denuncius,</HI> not having had their &s;en&s;es and rea&s;oning faculties exerci&s;ed, or their judgment cultivated, but tyrannized into implicit obe|dience, and perhaps into an irreparable meanne&s;s, abject|ne&s;s, and &s;lavi&s;hne&s;s of &s;pirit, &s;ally forth into action, and the wide world at random; ignorant of the roads that lead to true honour and happine&s;s, and unapprized of the latent dangers of vice and error, till perhaps they are &s;urpri&s;ed, &s;wallowed up, or otherwi&s;e undone by their con&s;equences.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the rever&s;ene&s;s of the&s;e two charac|ters, they are almo&s;t always mi&s;erably confounded by the undi&s;cerning world, who are ever liable to be deceived by fal&s;e appearances. Narrow re&s;erve, and pedantic mo|ro&s;ene&s;s have pa&s;&s;ed for &s;ound wi&s;dom and profound di&s;|cretion: In&s;tructors of youth have degenerated into the corruptors and depravers of it; authority into tyranny, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion into &s;lavery: hence it is, that the mo&s;t de&s;picable and worthle&s;s pretenders have put up for that veneration and e&s;teem, only due to men of ability and worth; and oftener men of ability and worth have been obliged to &s;hare the contempt due to knaves and dunces by this means, the mo&s;t laudable and honourable pro|fe&s;&s;ion in the world, i. e. the in&s;tructing of youth, is e&s;teemed mean, dependent, and &s;ervile; and thus, in far more in&s;tances than immediately relate to my purpo&s;e,
<PB N="ix" REF="029518_0005_0FE1CBAB3384E378">
a nice ob&s;erver may di&s;cern. "That the boundaries of di&s;tinction between good and evil are almo&s;t lo&s;t in the world."</P>
<P>Grammatical learning is at pre&s;ent, perhaps, too much out of fa&s;hion, e&s;pecially among the ladies. Mo&s;t of our Engli&s;h Grammars are &s;o dependent upon the Latin, that they appear only tran&s;lations of them, intro|ducing many needle&s;s perplexities; as &s;uperfluous ca&s;es, genders, moods, ten&s;es, &amp;c. peculiarities which our lan|guage is exempt from: therefore it mu&s;t proceed from ignorance or parade in any &s;choolma&s;ter, to teach or pretend much advantage therefrom, to a mere Engli&s;h &s;cholar; and it is owing to this ignorance or un&s;ucce&s;s|ful pretence, that Engli&s;h Grammar is &s;o much neg|lected, or &s;o lightly e&s;teemed as it is, even among&s;t men of learning; though it is generally allowed, that none can &s;peak or write properly who are ignorant of Gram|mar: therefore it becomes nece&s;&s;ary that a practical Engli&s;h Grammar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Fi&s;her's Engli&s;h Grammar.</HI></NOTE> &s;hould be con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf, and independent of the Latin, except in &s;uch articles as are common to both.</P>
<P>People can never di&s;play their talents to much advan|tage, either in writing or conver&s;ation, unle&s;s they have a ta&s;te for the beauty and propriety of their mother tongue; and which they can never have, without learn|ing it, &s;o as to know the nature and kinds of words, with their connections and dependencies upon one another. That many women read much, and yet not to edification, is chiefly becau&s;e they are ignorant of the&s;e connections and dependencies, and thereby apply relatives to wrong antecedents, verbs to wrong names, particularly where there is a genitive ca&s;e between a nominative word and the verb; mi&s;take things for per&s;ons, and per&s;ons for things, and are thereby mi&s;led in the &s;en&s;e of what they are about to trace, e&s;pecially in circum&s;tantial authors, or &s;uch as the generality call dark and ob&s;cure writers, meaning tho&s;e who, by tran&s;po&s;ition, &amp;c. deviate from the general order of the language: they feel an entangle|ment, though they know not what or where, and are equally blind to the beauties and idioms of language. I could ea&s;ily exemplify this, but it would be tedious to
<PB N="x" REF="029518_0006_0FE1CBB996A05FA8">
demon&s;trate it to tho&s;e who know nothing of government or con&s;truction, and needle&s;s to tho&s;e who do, and have ever experienced the want of it in others.</P>
<P>Women being thus left lame in their learning, are in a great mea&s;ure incapable of further improving them|&s;elves in &s;pite of all the pains that writers have taken, or may take, till the ob&s;tacle be removed: and &s;till to ag|gravate the ca&s;e, they are mo&s;tly put to &s;ewing, or &s;im|ilar articles under the care of &s;ome mi&s;tre&s;s, who is per|haps either utterly incapable of a&s;&s;i&s;ting them in the pur&s;uit of knowledge, or who, from a crowd of &s;cholars, wants time to point out, or explain to them, &s;uch places or &s;ubjects of books as are be&s;t adapted to their &s;everal wants, or even to direct them in the choice of books. Others there are who have not a book in their &s;chools, or &s;uch only as are no way &s;uitable for youth. The&s;e impediments are very lamentable, e&s;pecially as they oc|cur in the very nick of time a young lady &s;hould be taught to think, reflect, and form a ta&s;te of life in.</P>
<P>I do not mean to recommend <HI>reading</HI> at the expence of <HI>&s;ewing;</HI> but would only make a principle of the former. There are &s;everal governe&s;&s;es, doubtle&s;s, who are very capable of in&s;tructing young ladies in both, which would form an agreeable variety, by relaxing or relieving them from one by the other.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have no ta&s;te for intellectual amu&s;ements, will &s;eize upon the next thing at hand, be it of ever &s;o light or fanta&s;tical a kind. "A love for diver&s;ions, where it has once got footing, &s;teals on per&s;ons in&s;en&s;ibly, till it engro&s;&s;es their whole time: it therefore becomes nece&s;&s;ary to get the &s;tart of it, and prepo&s;&s;e&s;s them early with a love of books."</P>

As he was mu&s;ing on his pre&s;ent condition, and very much perplexed in him&s;elf on the &s;tate of life he &s;hould chu&s;e, he &s;aw two women of a larger &s;ize than ordinary approaching towards him.

Sumptu|ous tables, beds of ro&s;es, clouds of perfumes, concerts of mu&s;ic, crowds of beauties, are all in readine&s;s to receive you. Come along with me into this region of delights, this world of plea&s;ure, and bid farewell for ever to care, to pain, and to bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Hercules,</HI> hearing the lady talk after this manner, de&s;i|red to know her name; to which &s;he an&s;wered, My friends, and tho&s;e who are well acquainted with me, call me <HI>Happine&s;s;</HI> but my enemies, and tho&s;e who would injure my reputation, have given me the name of <HI>Plea&s;ure.</HI></P>
<P>By this time the other lady was come up, who addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to the young hero is a very different manner.</P>
<P><HI>Hercules.</HI> (&s;ays &s;he) I offer my&s;elf to you becau&s;e I know you are de&s;cended from the gods, and give proofs of that de&s;cent, by your love of virtue, and application to the &s;tudies proper for your age. This makes me hope you will gain both for your&s;elf and me an immortal reputa|tion. But before I invite you into my &s;ociety and friend|&s;hip, I will be open and &s;incere with you; and mu&s;t lay down this as an e&s;tabli&s;hed truth, that there is nothing truly valuable which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> purcha&s;ed without pains and labour. The gods <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;et a price upon every real and noble plea&s;ure. If you would gain the favour of the
<PB N="13" REF="029518_0007_0FE1CBBC723DB5A8">
Deity, you mu&s;t be at the pains of wor&s;hipping him: if the friend&s;hip of good men, you mu&s;t &s;tudy to oblige them; if you would be honoured by your country, you mu&s;t take care to &s;erve it. In &s;hort, if you would be em|inent in war or peace, you mu&s;t become ma&s;ter of all the qualifications that can make you &s;o. The&s;e are the only terms and conditions upon which I can propo&s;e happi|ne&s;s. The godde&s;s of Plea&s;ure here broke in upon her di&s;cour&s;e: you &s;ee, (&s;aid &s;he) <HI>Hercules,</HI> by her own con|fe&s;&s;ion, the way to her plea&s;ure is long and difficult, whereas that which I propo&s;e is &s;hort and ea&s;y. Alas! (&s;aid the other lady, who&s;e vi&s;age glowed with a pa&s;&s;ion made up of &s;corn and pity) what are the plea&s;ures you propo&s;e? To eat before you are hungry, drink be|fore you are thir&s;ty, &s;leep before you are tired, to gratify appetites before they are rai&s;ed, and rai&s;e &s;uch appetites as nature never planted. You never heard the mo&s;t de|licious mu&s;ic, which is the prai&s;e of one's &s;elf; nor &s;aw the mo&s;t beautiful object, which is the work of one's own hands. Your votaries pa&s;s away their youth in a dream of mi&s;taken plea&s;ure, while they are hoarding up angui&s;h, torment, and remor&s;e for old age.</P>
<P>As for me, I am the friend of the gods and of good men, an agreeable companion of the arti&s;an, an hou&s;e|hold guardian to the fathers of families, a patron and protector of &s;ervants, and an a&s;&s;ociate in all true and generous friend&s;hip. The banquets of my votaries are never co&s;tly, but always delicious; for none eat and drink at them who are not invited by hunger and thir&s;t. Their &s;lumbers are &s;ound, and their wakings are cheerful. My young men have the plea&s;ure of hearing them&s;elves prai&s;ed by tho&s;e who are in years, and tho&s;e who are in years, of being honoured by tho&s;e who are young. In a word, my followers are favoured by the gods, beloved by their acquaintances, e&s;teemed by their country, and (after the clo&s;e of their labours) honoured by po&s;terity.</P>
<P>We know, by the life of this memorable hero, to which of the&s;e two ladies he gave up his heart; and, I believe, every one who reads this, will do him the ju&s;tice to ap|prove his choice.</P>
<P>I very much admire the &s;peeches of the&s;e ladies, as containing in them the chief arguments for a life of vir|tue, or a life of plea&s;ure, that could enter into the
<PB N="14" REF="029518_0008_0FE1CBBE15A8B168">
thoughts of an Heathen; but am particularly plea&s;ed with the different figures he gives the two godde&s;&s;es. Our modern authors have repre&s;ented plea&s;ure and vice with an alluring face, but ending in &s;nakes and mon&s;ters. Here &s;he appears in all the charms of beauty, though they are fal&s;e and borrowed; and by that means compo&s;e a vi&s;ion entirely natural and plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>I have tran&s;lated this allegory for the benefit of youth; and particularly of tho&s;e who are &s;till in the deplorable &s;tate of non-exi&s;tence, and whom I mo&s;t earne&s;tly intreat to come into the world. Let my embrios &s;hew the lea&s;t inclination to any &s;ingle virtue, and I &s;hall allow it to be &s;truggling towards birth. I do not expect of them, that, like the hero in the foregoing &s;tory, they &s;hould go about as &s;oon as they are born, with a club in their hands, and a lion's &s;kin on their &s;houlders, to root out mon&s;ters, and de&s;troy tyrants: but as the fine&s;t author of all antiquity has &s;aid upon this very occa&s;ion, Though a man has not the abilities to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf in the mo&s;t &s;hining parts of a great character, he has certainly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he capacity of being ju&s;t, faithful, mode&s;t, and temperate.</P>

<P>IDLENESS is &s;o general a di&s;temper, that I cannot but imagine a &s;peculation on this &s;ubject will be of uni|ver&s;al u&s;e. There is hardly any one per&s;on without &s;ome alloy of it; and thou&s;ands be&s;ides my&s;elf &s;pend more time in an idle uncertainty, whether of two affairs to begin fir&s;t, than would have been &s;ufficient to have ended them both. The occa&s;ion of this &s;eems to be the want of &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary employment to put the &s;pirits in motion, and to awaken them out of their lethargy. If I had le&s;s lei&s;ure, I &s;hould have more; for I &s;hould then find time di&s;tingui&s;hed into portions, &s;ome for bu&s;ine&s;s, and others for the indulging of plea&s;ures: but now one face of indolence over&s;preads the whole, and I have no land mark to direct my&s;elf by. Were one's time a little &s;traitened by bu&s;ine&s;s, like water inclo&s;ed in its banks, it

would have &s;ome determined cour&s;e; but unle&s;s it be put into &s;ome channel, it has no current, but becomes a del|uge without either u&s;e or motion.</P>
<P>When <HI>Scanderberg,</HI> Prince of <HI>Epirus,</HI> was dead, the <HI>Turks,</HI> who had but too often felt the force of his arm in the battles he had won from them, imagined, that by wear|ing a piece of his bones near their hearts, they &s;hould be animated with a vigour and force like that which in&s;pired him when living. As I am like to be but of little u&s;e while I live, I am re&s;olved to do what good I can after my decea&s;e; and have accordingly ordered my bones to be di&s;po&s;ed of in this manner for the good of my country|men, who are troubled with too exorbitant a degree of fire. All fox-hunters, upon wearing me, would in a &s;hort time be brought to endure their bed in a morning, and perhaps even quit them with regret at ten: in&s;tead of hurrying away to teaze a poor animal, and run away from their own thoughts, a chair or a chariot would be thought the mo&s;t de&s;irable means of performing a remove from one place to another. I &s;hould be a cure for the unnatural de&s;ire of <HI>John <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> for dancing, and a &s;pecific to le&s;&s;en the inclination Mrs. <HI>Fidget</HI> has to motion, and cau&s;e her always to give her approbation to the pre&s;ent place &s;he is in. In fine, no <HI>Egyptian</HI> Mummy was ever half &s;o u&s;eful in phy&s;ic, as I &s;hould be to tho&s;e feveri&s;h con&s;titutions, to repre&s;s the violent follies of youth, and to give to each action its proper weight and repo&s;e.</P>
<P>I can &s;tifle any violent inclination, and oppo&s;e a torrent of anger, or the &s;olicitations of revenge, with &s;ucce&s;s. But indolence is a &s;tream which flows &s;lowly on, but yet undermines the foundation of every virtue. A vice of a more lively nature were a more de&s;irable tyrant than this ru&s;t of the mind, which gives a tincture of its nature to every action of one's life. It were as little hazard to be to&s;&s;ed in a &s;torm, as to lie thus perpetually becalmed: and it is to no purpo&s;e to have within one the &s;eeds of a thou&s;and good qualities, if we want the vigour and re&s;olu|tion nece&s;&s;ary for exerting them. Death brings all per&s;ons back to an equality; and this image of it, this &s;lumber of the mind, leaves no difference between the greate&s;t genius and the meane&s;t under&s;tanding: a faculty of doing things remarkably prai&s;e worthy thus concealed, is of no more u&s;e to the owner than a heap of gold to a man who dares not u&s;e it.</P>

To-morrow is &s;till the fatal time when all is to be recti|fied: to-morrow comes, it goes, and &s;till I plea&s;e my&s;elf with the &s;hadow whil&s;t I lo&s;e the reality; unmindful that the pre&s;ent time alone is ours, the future is yet unborn, and the pa&s;t is dead, and can only live (as parents in their children) in the actions it has produced.</P>
<P>The time we live ought not to be computed by the number of years, but by the u&s;e which has been made of it; thus, it is not the extent of ground, but the yearly rent which gives the value to the e&s;tate. Wretched and thoughtle&s;s creatures, in the only place where covetou&s;ne&s;s were a virtue, we turn prodigals! Nothing lies upon our hands with &s;uch unea&s;ine&s;s; nor has there been &s;o many devices for any one thing, as to make it &s;lide away imper|ceptibly and to no purpo&s;e. A &s;hilling &s;hall be hoarded up with care, whil&s;t that which is above the price of an e&s;tate is flung away with di&s;regard and contempt. There is nothing now a-days &s;o much avoided as a &s;olicitous improvement of every part of time; it is a report that mu&s;t be &s;hunned as one tenders the name of a wit and a fine genius, and as one fears the dreadful character of a laborious prodder: but notwith&s;tanding this, the greate&s;t wits any age has produced thought far otherwi&s;e; for who can think either <HI>Socrates</HI> or <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> lo&s;t any repu|tation, by their continual pains both in overcoming the defects and improving the gifts of nature? All are ac|quainted with the labour and a&s;&s;iduity with which <HI>Tully</HI> acquired his eloquence. <HI>Seneca,</HI> in his letters to <HI>Lucilius,</HI> a&s;&s;ures him, there was not a day in which he did not either write &s;omething, or read and epitomi&s;e &s;ome good author; and I remember <HI>Pliny,</HI> in one of his letters, where he gives an account of the various methods he u&s;ed to fill up every vacancy of time, after &s;everal employments which he enumerates; &s;ometimes, &s;ays he, I hunt; but even then I carry with me a pocket book, that whil&s;t my &s;ervants are bu&s;ied in di&s;po&s;ing of the nets and other matters, I may be employed in &s;omething that may be u&s;eful to me in my &s;tudies; and that if I mi&s;s of my game, I may at lea&s;t bring home &s;ome of my own thoughts with me, and not have the mortification of having caught nothing all day.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, you &s;ee how many examples I recal to mind, and what arguments I u&s;e with my&s;elf to regain my liber|ty; but as I am afraid it is no ordinary per&s;ua&s;ion that

<P>WE all of us complain of the &s;hortne&s;s of time, &s;aith <HI>Seneca,</HI> and yet have much more than we know what to do with. Our lives, &s;ays he, are &s;pent either in doing nothing at all, or in doing nothing to the purpo&s;e, or in doing nothing that we ought to do. We are always complaining our days are few, and acting as though there would be no end of them. That noble philo&s;opher has de&s;cribed our incon&s;i&s;tency with our&s;elves in this particu|lar, by all tho&s;e various turns of expre&s;&s;ion and thought which are peculiar to his writings.</P>
<P>I often con&s;ider mankind as wholly incon&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf in a point that bears &s;ome affinity to the former. Though we &s;eem grieved at the &s;hortne&s;s of life in general, we are wi&s;hing every period of it at an end. The minor longs to be at age, then to be a man of bu&s;ine&s;s, then to make up an e&s;tate, then to arrive at honors, then to retire. Thus, although the whole of life is allowed by every one to be &s;hort, the &s;everal divi&s;ions of it appear to be long and tedious. We are for lengthening our &s;pan in general, but would fain contract the parts of which it is compo&s;ed. The u&s;urer would be very well &s;atisfied to have all the time annihilated that lies between the pre&s;ent moment and next quarter day. The politician would be content to lo&s;e three years in his life, could he place things in the po&s;ture which he fancies they will &s;tand in after &s;uch a
<PB N="18" REF="029518_0010_0FE1CBCE0A71B0D8">
revolution of time. The lover would be glad to &s;trike out of his exi&s;tence all the moments that are to pa&s;s away before the happy meeting. Thus, as fa&s;t as our time runs, we &s;hould be very glad, in mo&s;t part of our lives, that it ran much fa&s;ter than it does. Several hours of the day hang upon our hands, nay, we wi&s;h away whole years, and travel through time as through a country filled with many wild and empty wa&s;tes, which we would fain hurry over, that we may arrive at tho&s;e &s;everal little &s;ettlements, or imaginary points of re&s;t, which are di&s;|per&s;ed up and down in it.</P>
<P>If we divide the life of mo&s;t men into twenty parts, we &s;hall find that at lea&s;t nineteen of them are mere gaps and cha&s;ms, which are neither filled with plea&s;ure nor bu&s;ine&s;s. I do not, however, include in this calculation the life of tho&s;e men who are in a perpetual hurry of affairs, but of tho&s;e only who are not always engaged in &s;cenes of action; and I hope I &s;hall not do an unacceptable piece of &s;ervice to tho&s;e per&s;ons, if I point out to them certain methods for the filling up their empty &s;paces of life. The methods I &s;hall propo&s;e to them are as follow:</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is the exerci&s;e of virtue, in the mo&s;t general acceptation of the word. That particular &s;cheme which comprehends the &s;ocial virtues, may give employment to the mo&s;t indu&s;trious temper, and find a man more bu&s;ine&s;s than the mo&s;t active &s;tation of life. To advi&s;e the igno|rant, relieve the needy, comfort the afflicted, are duties that fall in our way almo&s;t every day of our lives. A man has frequent opportunities of mitigating the fiercene&s;s of a party; of doing ju&s;tice to the character of a de&s;erving man; of &s;oftening the envious, quieting the angry, and rectifying the prejudiced; which are all of them employ|ments &s;uited to a rea&s;onable nature, and bring great &s;atis|faction to the per&s;on who can bu&s;y him&s;elf in them with di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>There is another kind of virtue that may find employ|ment for tho&s;e retired hours in which we are altogether left to our&s;elves, and de&s;titute of company and conver&s;a|tion: I mean that intercour&s;e and communication which every rea&s;onable creature ought to maintain with the great Author of his being. The man who lives under an habitual &s;en&s;e of the Divine pre&s;ence, keeps up a per|petual cheerfulne&s;s of temper, and enjoys every moment
<PB N="19" REF="029518_0010_0FE1CBCE0A71B0D8">
the &s;atisfaction of thinking him&s;elf in company with his deare&s;t and be&s;t of friends. The time never lies heavy upon him: it is impo&s;&s;ible for him to be alone. His thoughts and pa&s;&s;ions are the mo&s;t bu&s;ied at &s;uch hours, when tho&s;e of other men are the mo&s;t inactive. He no &s;ooner &s;teps out of the world, but his heart burns with devotion, &s;wells with hope, and triumphs in the con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of that pre&s;ence which every where &s;urrounds him: or, on the contrary, pours out its fears, its &s;orrows, its apprehen&s;ions, to the great Supporter of its exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>I have here only con&s;idered the nece&s;&s;ity of a man's being virtuous, that he may have &s;omething to do; but if I con&s;ider further, that the exerci&s;e of virtue is not only an amu&s;ement for the time it la&s;ts, but that its influ|ence extends to tho&s;e parts of our exi&s;tence which lie beyond the grave; and that our whole eternity is to take its colour from tho&s;e hours which we here employ in virtue or in vice, the argument redoubles upon us, for putting in practice this method of pa&s;&s;ing away our time.</P>
<P>When a man has but a little &s;tock to improve, and has opportunities of turning it all to good account, what &s;hall we think of him if he &s;uffers nineteen parts of it to lie dead, and perhaps employs even the twentieth to his ruin or di&s;advantage? But becau&s;e the mind cannot be always in its fervours, nor &s;trained up to a pitch of virtue, it is nece&s;&s;ary to find out proper employments for it in its relaxations.</P>
<P>The next method therefore that I would propo&s;e to fill up our time, &s;hould be u&s;eful and innocent diver&s;ion. I mu&s;t confe&s;s I think it is below rea&s;onable creatures to be altogether conver&s;ant in &s;uch diver&s;ions as are merely innocent, and have nothing el&s;e to recommend them; but that there is no hurt in them. Whether any kind of gaming has even thus much to &s;ay for it&s;elf, I &s;hall not determine; but I think it is very wonderful to &s;ee per&s;ons of the be&s;t &s;en&s;e pa&s;&s;ing away a dozen of hours together in &s;hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tling and dividing a pack of cards, with no other conver&s;ation but what is made up of a few game phra&s;es, and no other ideas but tho&s;e of black or red &s;pots ranged together in different figures. Would not a man laugh to hear any one of this &s;pecies complaining that life is &s;hort!</P>
<P>The &s;tage might be made a perpetual &s;ource of the mo&s;t noble and u&s;eful entertainments, were it under proper regulations.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="029518_0011_0FE1CBD032D44C70">
But the mind never unbends it&s;elf &s;o agreeably as in the conver&s;ation of a well-cho&s;en friend. There is indeed no ble&s;&s;ing in life that is any way comparable to the enjoyment of a di&s;creet and virtuous friend. It ea&s;es and unloads the mind, clears and improves the under&s;tanding, engenders thought and knowledge, animates virtue and good re&s;olutions, &s;ooths and allays the pa&s;&s;ions, and finds employment for mo&s;t of the vacant hours of life.</P>
<P>Next to &s;uch an intimacy with a particular per&s;on, one would endeavour after a more general conver&s;ation with &s;uch as are capable of edifying and entertaining tho&s;e with whom they conver&s;e, which are qualities that &s;eldom go a&s;under.</P>
<P>There are many other u&s;eful amu&s;ements of life which one would endeavour to multiply, that one might, on all occa&s;ions, have recour&s;e to &s;omething, rather than &s;uffer the mind to lie idle, or run adrift with any pa&s;&s;ion that chances to ari&s;e in it.</P>
<P>A man that has a ta&s;te for mu&s;ic, painting, or architec|ture, is like one that has another &s;en&s;e, when compared with &s;uch as have no reli&s;h of tho&s;e arts. The flori&s;t, the planter, the gardener, the hu&s;bandman, when they are only as accompli&s;hments to the man of fortune, are great reliefs to a country life, and many ways u&s;eful to tho&s;e who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of them.</P>

On his left hand &s;tood the keeper of <HI>Erebus,</HI> on his right hand the keeper of <HI>Ely&s;ium.</HI> I was told he &s;at judge on women that day, there being &s;everal of the &s;ex lately arrived, who had not yet their man&s;ions a&s;&s;igned them. I was &s;urpri&s;ed to hear him a&s;k every one of them the &s;ame que&s;tion, <HI>What they had been doing?</HI> Upon this que&s;tion being propo&s;ed to the whole a&s;&s;embly, they &s;tared upon one another, as not knowing what to an&s;wer. He then interrogated each of them &s;eparately. Madam, &s;ays he to the fir&s;t of them, you have been upon the earth about fifty years: what have you been doing there all this while? Doing! &s;ays &s;he, really I do not know what I have been doing: I de&s;ire I may have time given me to recollect. After about half an hour's pau&s;e, &s;he told him &s;he had been playing at crimp; upon which <HI>Rhadamanthus</HI> beckoned to the keeper on his left hand to take her into cu&s;tody. And you, Madam, &s;ays the judge, who look with &s;uch a &s;oft and langui&s;h|ing air, I think you &s;et our for this place in your nine and twentieth year, what have you been doing all this while? I had a great deal of bu&s;ine&s;s on my hands, &s;ays &s;he, being taken up the fir&s;t twelve years of my life in dre&s;&s;ing a jointed baby, and the remaining part of it in reading plays and romances. Very well, &s;ays he, you have employed your time to good purpo&s;e: away with her. The next was a plain country woman: well, mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;ays <HI>Rhadamanthus,</HI> and what have you been doing? If it plea&s;e your Wor&s;hip, &s;ays &s;he, I did not live quite forty years; and in that time brought my hu&s;band &s;even daugh|ters, made him nine thou&s;and chee&s;es, and left my elde&s;t

girl with him, to look after his hou&s;e in my ab&s;ence, and who I may venture to &s;ay is as pretty a hou&s;e-wife as any in the country. <HI>Rhadamanthus</HI> &s;miled at the &s;implicity of the good woman, and ordered the keeper of <HI>Ely&s;ium</HI> to take her into <HI>his</HI> care. And you, fair lady, &s;ays he, what have you been doing the&s;e five and thirty years? I have been doing no hurt, I a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, &s;aid &s;he. That is well, &s;ays he; but what good have you been doing? The lady was in great confu&s;ion at this que&s;tion, and not knowing what to an&s;wer, the two keepers leaped out to &s;eize her at the &s;ame time; the one took her by the hand to convey her to <HI>Ely&s;ium,</HI> the other caught hold of her to carry her away to <HI>Erebus.</HI> But <HI>Rhadamanthus</HI> ob&s;erving an ingenu|ous mode&s;ty in her countenance and behaviour, bid them both let her loo&s;e, and &s;et her a&s;ide for re-examination when he was more at lei&s;ure. An old woman, of a proud and &s;our look, pre&s;ented her&s;elf next to the bar, and being a&s;ked what &s;he had been doing? Truly, &s;ays &s;he, I lived three&s;core and ten years in a very wicked world, and was &s;o angry at the behaviour of a parcel of young flirts, that I pa&s;t mo&s;t of my la&s;t years in condemning the follies of the times: I was every day blaming the &s;illy conduct of the people about me, in order to deter tho&s;e I conver&s;ed with from falling into the like errors and mi&s;carriages Very well, &s;ays <HI>Rhadamanthus,</HI> but did you keep the &s;ame watchful eye over your own actions? Why, truly, &s;ays &s;he, I was &s;o taken up with publi&s;hing the faults of others, that I had not time to con&s;ider my own. Madam, &s;ays <HI>Rhadamanthus,</HI> be plea&s;ed to file off to the left, and make room for the venerable matron that &s;tands behinds you. Old gentlewoman, &s;ays he, I think you are four&s;core: you have heard the que&s;tion, what have you been doing &s;o long in the world? Ah, Sir! &s;ays &s;he, I have been doing what I &s;hould not have done; but I had made a firm re&s;olution to have changed my life, if I had not been &s;natched off by an untimely end. Madam, &s;ays he, you will plea&s;e to follow your leader; and &s;pying another of the &s;ame age, interrogated her in the &s;ame form. To whom the matron replied, I have been the wife of a hu&s;band, who was as dear to me in his old age as in his youth. I have been a mother, and very happy in my children, whom I endeavoured to bring up in every thing that was good. My elde&s;t &s;on is ble&s;&s;ed by the

poor, and beloved by every one that knows him. I lived within my own family, and left it much more wealthy than I found it. <HI>Rhadamanthus</HI> who knew the value of the old lady, &s;miled upon her in &s;uch a manner, that the keeper of <HI>Ely&s;ium,</HI> who knew his office, reached out his hand to her. He no &s;ooner touched her, but her wrinkles van|i&s;hed, her eyes &s;parkled, her cheeks glowed with blu&s;hes, and &s;he appeared in full beauty. A young woman ob&s;erv|ing, that this officer who conducted the happy to <HI>Ely&s;ium,</HI> was &s;o great a <HI>beautifier,</HI> longed to be in his hands; &s;o that pre&s;&s;ing through the crowd, &s;he was the next who appeared at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he bar. And being a&s;ked, what &s;he had been doing the five and twenty years &s;he had been in the world. I have endeavoured &s;ays &s;he, ever &s;ince I came to years of di&s;cretion, to make my&s;elf lovely, and gain admirers. In order to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> my time in bottling up <HI>May</HI> dew, inventing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> wa&s;hes, mixing colours, cutting out patches, con&s;i&s;ting my gla&s;s, &s;uiting my complexion, tearing off my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, &s;inking my &s;tays.&mdash;<HI>Rhadamanthus,</HI> without hearing her out, gave the &s;ign to take her off. Upon the approach of the keeper of <HI>Erebus,</HI> her colour faded, her face puckered up with wrinkles, and her whole per&s;on was lo&s;t in deformity.</P>
<P>I was then &s;urpri&s;ed with a di&s;tant &s;ound of a whole troop of females that came forward laughing, &s;inging, and dancing. I was very de&s;irous to know the reception they would meet with, and withal was very apprehen|&s;ive that <HI>Rhadamanthus</HI> would &s;poil their mirth: but at their nearer approach, the noi&s;e grew &s;o very great that it awakened me.</P>
<P>I lay &s;ome time, reflecting in my&s;elf on the oddne&s;s of this dream, and could not forbear a&s;king my own heart what I was doing?

<P>I &s;hall conclude with recommending to them the &s;ame &s;hort &s;elf-examination. If every one of them fre|quently lays his hand upon his heart, and con&s;iders what he is doing, it will check him in all the idle, or, what is wor&s;e, the vicious moments of life; lift up his mind when it is running on in a &s;eries of indifferent ac|tions, and encourage him when he is engaged in tho&s;e

<P>IF there be any thing which makes human nature ap|pear <HI>ridiculous</HI> to beings of &s;uperior faculties, it mu&s;t be Pride. They know &s;o well the vanity of tho&s;e imag|inary perfections that &s;well the heart of man, and of tho&s;e little &s;upernumerary advantages, whether in birth, fortune, or title, which one man enjoys above another, that it mu&s;t certainly very much a&s;toni&s;h, if it does not very much divert them, when they &s;ee a mortal puffed up, and valuing him&s;elf above his neighbours on any of the&s;e accounts, at the &s;ame time that he is obnoxious to all the common calamities of the &s;pecies.</P>
<P>To &s;et this thought in its true light, we &s;hall fancy, if you plea&s;e, that yonder mole-hill is inhabited by rea&s;on|able creatures, and that every pi&s;mire (his &s;hape and way of life only excepted) is endowed with human pa&s;&s;ions. How &s;hould we &s;mile to hear one give an account of the pedigrees, di&s;tinctions, and titles that reign among&s;t them! Ob&s;erve how the whole &s;warm divide, and make way for the pi&s;mire that pa&s;&s;es through them! You mu&s;t under|&s;tand he is an emmet of quality, and has better blood in his veins than any pi&s;mire in the mole-hill. Do you not &s;ee how &s;en&s;ible he is of it, how &s;low he marches forward, how the whole rabble of ants keep their di&s;tance? Here you may ob&s;erve one placed upon a little eminence, and looking down on a long row of laborers. He is the riche&s;t in&s;ect on this &s;ide the hillock: he has a walk of half a yard in length, and a quarter of an inch in breadth; he keeps one hundred menial &s;ervants, and has at lea&s;t fifteen bar|ley corns in his granary. He is now chiding and en&s;lav|ing the emmet that &s;tands before him, and who, for all we can di&s;cover, is as good an emmet as him&s;elf.</P>
<P>But here comes an in&s;ect of figure: do not you take
<PB N="25" REF="029518_0013_0FE1CBD376E97AD8">
notice of a little white &s;traw that he carries in his mouth? That &s;traw, you mu&s;t under&s;tand, he would not part with for the longe&s;t tract about the mole-hill: did you but know what he has undergone to purcha&s;e it! See how the ants of all qualities and conditions &s;warm about him. Should this &s;traw drop out of his mouth, you would &s;ee all this numerous circle of attendants follow the next that took it up, and leave the di&s;carded in&s;ect, or run over his back to come at his &s;ucce&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>If now you have a mind to &s;ee all the ladies of the mole|hill, ob&s;erve fir&s;t the pi&s;mire that li&s;tens to the emmet on her left hand, at the &s;ame time &s;he &s;eems to turn away her head from him. He tells this poor infect that &s;he is a godde&s;s; that her eyes are brighter than the &s;un; that life and death are at her di&s;po&s;al. She believes him, and gives her&s;elf a thou&s;and little airs upon it. Mark the vanity of the pi&s;mire on her left hand. She can &s;carce crawl with age; but you mu&s;t know &s;he values her&s;elf upon her birth; and, if you mind, &s;purns at every one that comes within her reach. The little nimble coquette that is running along the &s;ide of her is a wit. She has broken many a pi&s;mire's heart. Do but ob&s;erve what a drove of lovers are running after her.</P>
<P>We will here fini&s;h this imaginary &s;cene; but fir&s;t of all, to draw the parallel clo&s;er, will &s;uppo&s;e, if you plea&s;e, that death comes down upon the mole-hill in the &s;hape of a cock-&s;parrow, and picks up, without di&s;tinction, the pi&s;mire of quality, and his flatterers, the pi&s;mire of &s;ub&s;tance and his day-labourers, the white-&s;traw officer and his &s;ycophants, with all the godde&s;&s;es, wits, and beauties of the mole-hill.</P>
<P>May we not imagine that beings of &s;uperior natures and perfections regard all the in&s;tances of pride and vanity among our own &s;pecies in the &s;ame kind of view, when they take a &s;urvey of tho&s;e who inhabit this earth; or, in the language of an ingenious <HI>French</HI> poet, of tho&s;e pi&s;mires that people this heap of dirt, which human vanity has divided into climates and regions.</P>

<P>IN the mid&s;t of that va&s;t ocean, commonly called the <HI>South Sea,</HI> lie the i&s;lands of <HI>Solomon.</HI> In the centre of tho&s;e lies one, not only di&s;tant from the re&s;t, which are immen&s;ely &s;cattered round it, but al&s;o larger beyond proportion. An ance&s;tor of the Prince, who now reigns ab&s;olute in this central i&s;land, has, through a long de&s;|cent of ages, entailed the name of <HI>Solomon's I&s;lands</HI> on the whole, by the effect of that wi&s;dom wherewith he had poli&s;hed the manners of his people.</P>
<P>A de&s;cendant of one of the great men of this happy i&s;land, becoming a gentleman to &s;o improved a degree as to de&s;pi&s;e the good qualities which had originally en|nobled his family, thought of nothing but how to &s;up|port and di&s;tingui&s;h his dignity by the pride of an igno|rant mind, and a di&s;po&s;ition abandoned to plea&s;ure. He had a hou&s;e on the &s;ea &s;ide, where he &s;pent great part of his time in hunting and fi&s;hing but found him|&s;elf at a lo&s;s in pur&s;uit of tho&s;e important diver&s;ions, by means of a long &s;lip of mar&s;h land, over grown with high reeds that lay between his hou&s;e and the &s;ea. Re|&s;olving, at length, that it became not a man of his qual|ity to &s;ubmit to re&s;traint in his plea&s;ures, for the ea&s;e and convenience of an ob&s;tinate mechanic; and having often endeavoured in vain to buy out the owner, who was an hone&s;t poor ba&s;ket-maker, and who&s;e livelihood depended on working up the flags of tho&s;e reeds, in a manner peculiar to him&s;elf, the gentleman took advan|tage of a very high wind, and commanded his &s;ervants to burn down the barrier.</P>
<P>The ba&s;ket-maker, who &s;aw him&s;elf undone, com|plained of the oppre&s;&s;ion in terms more &s;uited to his &s;en&s;e of the injury, than the re&s;pect due to the rank of the offender: and the reward this imprudence procured him, was the additional inju&s;tice of blows and reproach|es, and all kinds of in&s;ult and indignity.</P>
<P>There was but one way to a remedy, and he took it; for going to the capital with the marks of his hard u&s;age upon him, he threw him&s;elf at the &s;ect of the King, and
<PB N="27" REF="029518_0014_0FE1CBE05A555158">
procured a citation for his oppre&s;&s;or's appearance; who, confe&s;&s;ing the charge, proceeded to ju&s;tify his behaviour by the poor man's unmindfulne&s;s of the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion due from the vulgar to gentlemen of rank and di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>But pray, replied the King, what di&s;tinction of rank had the grandfather of your father; when, being a cleaver of wood in the palace of my ance&s;tors, he was rai&s;ed from among tho&s;e vulgar you &s;peak of with &s;uch contempt, in reward of an in&s;tance he gave of his courage and loyalty in defence of his ma&s;ter? Yet his di&s;tinction was nobler than yours: it was the di&s;tinction of &s;oul, not of birth; the &s;uperiority of worth, not of fortune! I am &s;orry I have a gentleman in my kingdom, who is ba&s;e enough to be ignorant, that ca&s;e and di&s;tinction of fortune were be&s;towed on him but to this end, that, being at re&s;t from all cares of providing for him&s;elf, he might apply his heart, head, and hand for the public advantage of others.</P>
<P>Here the king, di&s;continuing his &s;peech, fixed an eye of indignation on a &s;ullen re&s;entment of mein which he ob&s;erved in the haughty offender, who muttered out his di&s;like of the encouragement this way of thinking mu&s;t give to the commonalty, who, he &s;aid, were to be con|&s;idered as per&s;ons of no con&s;equence, in compari&s;on of men who were born to be honored. Where reflection is wanting, replied the King, with a &s;mile of di&s;dain, men mu&s;t find their defects in the pain of their &s;ufferings. <HI>Yarbuma,</HI> added he, turning to a captain of his galleys, &s;trip the injured and the injurer; and conveying them to one of the mo&s;t barbarous and remote&s;t of the i&s;lands, &s;et them a&s;hore in the night, and leave them both to their fortune.</P>
<P>The place in which they were landed was a mar&s;h: under cover of tho&s;e flags the gentleman was in hopes to conceal him&s;elf, and give the &s;lip to his companion, with whom he thought it a di&s;grace to be found: but the lights in the galley having given an alarm to the &s;avages, a con&s;iderable body of them came down, and di&s;covered in the morning, the two &s;trangers in their hiding-place. Setting up a di&s;mal yell, they &s;urrounded them; and advancing nearer and nearer with a kind of clubs, &s;eemed determined to di&s;patch them, without &s;en&s;e of ho&s;pitality or mercy.</P>
<P>Here the gentleman began to di&s;cover, that the &s;upe|riority
<PB N="28" REF="029518_0015_0FE1CBE283314A90">
of his blood was imaginary: for, between the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;hame and cold, under the nakedne&s;s he had never been u&s;ed to; a fear of the event from the fiercene&s;s of the &s;avages' approach; and the want of an idea whereby to &s;often or divert their a&s;perity, he fell behind the poor &s;harer of his calamity; and with an un&s;inewed, apprehen&s;ive, unmanly &s;neakingne&s;s of mein, gave up the po&s;t of honour, and made a leader of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> man whom he had thought it a di&s;grace to con&s;ider as a companion.</P>
<P>The ba&s;ket-maker, on the contrary, to whom the pov|erty of his condition had made nakedne&s;s habitual; to whom a life of pain and mortification repre&s;ented death as not dreadful; and who&s;e remembrance of his &s;kill in arts, of which the&s;e &s;avages, were ignorant, gave him hopes of becoming &s;afe, from demon&s;trating that he could be u&s;eful, moved with bolder and more open free|dom; and, having plucked a handful of the flags, &s;at down without emotion, and making &s;igns that he would &s;hew them &s;omething worthy of their attention, fell to work with &s;miles and noddings; while the &s;avages drew near, and gazed with expectation of the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>It was not long before he had wreathed a kind of cor|onet, of pretty workman&s;hip; and ri&s;ing with re&s;pect and fearfulne&s;s, approached the &s;avage who appeared the chief, and placed it gently on his head; who&s;e figure under this new ornament, &s;o charmed and &s;truck his followers, that they threw down all their clubs, and formed a dance of welcome and congratulation round the author of &s;o prized a favour.</P>
<P>There was not one but &s;hewed the marks of his impa|tience to be made as fine as his captain: &s;o the poor ba&s;ket-maker had his hands full of employment; and the &s;avages ob&s;erving one quite idle, while the other was &s;o bu&s;y in their &s;ervice, took up arms in behalf of natu|ral ju&s;tice, and began to lay on arguments in favour of their purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The ba&s;ket-maker's pity now effaced the remembrance of his &s;ufferings: &s;o he aro&s;e and re&s;cued his oppre&s;&s;or, by making &s;igns that he was ignorant of the art; but might, if they thought fit, be u&s;efully employed in wait|ing on the work, and fetching flags to his &s;upply as fa&s;t as he &s;hould want them.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="029518_0015_0FE1CBE283314A90">
This propo&s;ition luckily fell in with a de&s;ire the &s;ava|ges expre&s;&s;ed to keep them&s;elves at lei&s;ure, that they might crowd round, and mark the progre&s;s of a work they took &s;uch plea&s;ure in. They left the gentleman, therefore, to his duty in the ba&s;ket-maker's &s;ervice; and con&s;idered him, from that time forward, as one who was, and ought to be treated as inferiour to their benefactor.</P>
<P>Men, wives, and children, from all corners of the i&s;land, came in droves for coronets; and, &s;etting the gentleman to work to gather boughs and poles, made a fine hut to lodge the ba&s;ket-maker; and brought down daily from the country &s;uch provi&s;ions as they lived upon them&s;elves, taking care to offer the imagined &s;er|vant nothing till his ma&s;ter had done eating.</P>
<P>Three months reflection in this mortified condition, gave a new and ju&s;t turn to our gentleman's improved ideas; in&s;omuch, that, lying weeping, and awake, one night, he thus confe&s;&s;ed his &s;entiments in favour of the ba&s;ket-maker: I have been to blame, and wanted judg|ment to di&s;tingui&s;h between accident and excellence. When I &s;hould have mea&s;ured nature, I but looked to vanity. The preference which fortune gives is empty and imaginary; and I perceive, too late, that only things of u&s;e are naturally honourable. I am a&s;hamed, when I compare my malice, to remember your humanity: but if the gods &s;hould plea&s;e to call me to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my rank and happine&s;s, I would divide all with you in atonement for my ju&s;tly puni&s;hed arrogance.</P>
<P>He promi&s;ed, and performed his promi&s;e: for the King, &s;oon after, &s;ent the Captain who had landed them, with pre&s;ents to the &s;avages; and ordered him to bring both back again. And it continues to this day a cu&s;tom in that i&s;land, to degrade all gentlemen who can|not give a better rea&s;on for their pride, than that they were born to do nothing; and the word for this due puni&s;hment is, <HI>Send him to the ba&s;ket-maker.</HI></P>

Partic|ularly as to the affairs of this world, integrity hath many advantages over all the fine and artificial ways of di&s;&s;im|ulation and deceit; it is much the plainer and ea&s;ier, much the &s;afer and more &s;ecure way of dealing in the world; it has le&s;s of trouble and difficulty, of entangle|ment and perplexity, of danger and hazard in it; it is the &s;horte&s;t and neare&s;t way to our end, carrying us thither in a &s;trait line, and will hold out and la&s;t longe&s;t. The arts of deceit and cunning do continually grow weaker and le&s;s effectual and &s;erviceable to tho&s;e that u&s;e them; whereas integrity gains &s;trength by u&s;e, and the more and longer any man practi&s;eth it, the greater &s;ervice it does him, by confirming his reputation, and encouraging tho&s;e with whom he hath to do, to repo&s;e the greate&s;t tru&s;t and confidence in him, which is an un&s;peakable ad|vantage in the bu&s;ine&s;s and affairs of life.</P>
<P>Truth is always con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf, and needs noth|ing to help it out; it is always near at hand, and &s;its up|on our lips, and is ready to drop out before we are aware; whereas a lie is trouble&s;ome, and &s;ets a man's invention upon the rack, and one trick needs a great many more to make it good. It is like building upon a fal&s;e founda|tion,
<PB N="31" REF="029518_0016_0FE1CBE423E7ECD0">
which continually &s;tands in need of props to &s;hore it up, and proves at la&s;t to be more chargeable than to have rai&s;ed a &s;ub&s;tantial building at fir&s;t upon a true and &s;olid foundation; for &s;incerity is firm and &s;ub&s;tantial, and there is nothing hollow and un&s;ound in it, and becau&s;e it is plain and open, fears no di&s;covery; of which the crafty man is always in danger, and when he thinks he walks in the dark, all his pretences are &s;o tran&s;parent, that he that runs may read them: he is the la&s;t man that finds him&s;elf to be found out: and while he takes it for granted that he makes fools of others, he renders him|&s;elf ridiculous.</P>
<P>Add to all this, that &s;incerity is the mo&s;t compendious wi&s;dom, and an excellent in&s;trument for the &s;peedy di&s;|patch of bu&s;ine&s;s; it creates confidence in tho&s;e we have to deal with, &s;aves the labour of many inquiries, and brings things to an i&s;&s;ue in a few words: it is like travelling in a plain beaten road, that commonly brings men &s;ooner to their journey's end, than by ways in which they often lo&s;e them&s;elves. In a word, what&s;oever con|venience may be thought to be in fal&s;ehood and di&s;&s;imu|lation, it is &s;oon over; but the inconvenience of it is per|petual, becau&s;e it brings a man under an everla&s;ting jea|lou&s;y and &s;u&s;picion; &s;o that he is not believed when he &s;peaks the truth, nor tru&s;ted when perhaps he means hone&s;tly. When a man hath once forfeited the reputa|tion of his integrity, he is &s;et fa&s;t, and nothing will then &s;erve his turn, neither truth nor fal&s;ehood.</P>
<P>I have often thought, that God hath, in his great wi&s;dom, hid from men of fal&s;e and di&s;hone&s;t minds, the wonderful advantages of truth and integrity, to the pro&s;|perity even of their worldly affairs; tho&s;e men are &s;o blinded by their covetou&s;ne&s;s and ambition, that they cannot look beyond a pre&s;ent advantage, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> forbear to &s;eize upon it, though by ways never &s;o indirect; they cannot &s;ee &s;o far as to the remote&s;t con&s;equences of a &s;teady integrity, and the va&s;t benefit and advantage which it will bring a man at la&s;t. Were but this &s;ort of men wi&s;e and clear-&s;ighted enough to di&s;cern this, they would be hone&s;t out of very knavery, not out of any love to hone&s;ty and virtue, but with a crafty de&s;ign to promote and advance more effectually their own intere&s;ts; and therefore the ju&s;tice of the divine Providence hath hid
<PB N="32" REF="029518_0017_0FE1CBE5C4516860">
this true&s;t point of wi&s;dom from their eyes, that bad men might not be upon equal terms with the ju&s;t and upright, and &s;erve their own wicked de&s;igns by hone&s;t and lawful means.</P>
<P>Indeed, if a man were only to deal in the world for a day, and &s;hould never have occa&s;ion to conver&s;e more with mankind, never more need their good opinion or good word, it were then no great matter (&s;peaking as to the concernments of this world) if a man &s;pent his repu|tation all at once, and ventured it at one throw: but if he be to continue in the world, and would have the ad|vantage of conver&s;ation whil&s;t he is in it, let him make u&s;e of truth and &s;incerity in all his words and actions; for nothing but this will la&s;t and hold out to the end: all other arts will fail; but truth and integrity will carry a man through, and bear him out to the la&s;t.</P>

<P>There is a town in <HI>Warwick&s;hire</HI> of good note, and form|erly pretty famous for much animo&s;ity and di&s;&s;ention, the chief families of which have now turned all their whi&s;pers, back bitings, envy, and private malice into mirth and entertainment, by means of a peevi&s;h old gentlewo|man, known by the title of Lady <HI>Bluemantle.</HI> This heroine has for many years together out done the whole &s;i&s;terhood of go&s;&s;ips in invention, quick utterance, and unprovoked malice. This good body is of a la&s;ting con&s;titution, though extremely decayed in her eyes, and decrepid in her feet. The two circum&s;tances of being always at home from her lamene&s;s, and very attentive from her blindne&s;s, make her lodgings the receptacle of all that pa&s;&s;es in town, good or bad; but for the latter, &s;he &s;eems to have the better memory. There is another thing to be noted of her, which is, that as it is u&s;ual with old people, &s;he has a livelier memory of things which pa&s;&s;ed when &s;he was very young, than of late years. Add to all this, that &s;he not only does not love any body, but &s;he hates every body. The &s;tatue in <HI>Rome</HI> does not &s;erve to vent malice half &s;o well, as this old lady does to di&s;appoint it. She does not know the author of any thing that is told her; but can readily repeat the matter it&s;elf; therefore, though &s;he expo&s;es the whole town, &s;he offends no body in it. She is &s;o exqui&s;itely re&s;tle&s;s and peevi&s;h, that &s;he quarrels with all about her, and &s;ometimes, in a freak, will in&s;tantly change her habitation. To indulge this humour, &s;he is led about the grounds belonging to the &s;ame hou&s;e &s;he is in, and the per&s;ons to whom &s;he is to remove, being in the plot, are ready to receive her at her own chamber again. At &s;tated times the gentle woman at who&s;e hou&s;e &s;he &s;uppo&s;es &s;he is at the time, is &s;ent for to quarrel with, according to her common cu&s;tom. When they have a mind to drive the je&s;t, &s;he is immediately urged to that degree, that &s;he will board in a family with which &s;he has never yet been; and away &s;he will go this in&s;tant, and tell them all that the re&s;t have been &s;aying of them. By this means &s;he has been an inhabitant of every hou&s;e in the place; without &s;tirring from the &s;ame habitation; and the many &s;tories which every body furni&s;h her with to favour that deceit, make her the general intelligencer of the
<PB N="35" REF="029518_0018_0FE1CBF53AB76EE0">
town of all that can be &s;aid by one woman again&s;t another. Thus, groundle&s;s &s;tories die away, and &s;ometimes truths are &s;mothered under the general word; when they have a mind to di&s;countenance a thing, "Oh! that is in my Lady <HI>Bluemantle's</HI> memoirs."</P>
<P>Whoever receives impre&s;&s;ions to the di&s;advantage of others without examination, is to be had in no other credit for intelligence than this good Lady <HI>Bluemantle,</HI> who is &s;ubjected to have her ears impo&s;ed upon for want of other helps to better information. Add to this, that other &s;candal-bearers &s;u&s;pend the u&s;e of tho&s;e faculties which &s;he has lo&s;t, rather than apply them to do ju&s;tice to their neighbours; and I think, for the &s;ervice of my fair readers, to acquaint them, that there is a voluntary Lady <HI>Bluemantle</HI> at every vi&s;it in town.</P>

<P>WERE all the vexations of life put together, we &s;hould find, that a great part of them proceed from tho&s;e calumnies and reproaches which we &s;pread abroad con|cerning one another.</P>
<P>There is &s;carce a man living who is not, in &s;ome degree, guilty of this offence; though, at the &s;ame time, however we treat one another, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that we all con&s;ent in &s;peaking ill of the per&s;ons who are notorious in this practice. It generally takes its ri&s;e either from an ill will to mankind, a private inclination to make our&s;elves e&s;teemed, an o&s;tentation of wit, a vanity of being thought in the &s;ecrets of the world, or from a de&s;ire of gratifying any of the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions of mind in tho&s;e per&s;ons with whom we conver&s;e.</P>
<P>The publi&s;her of &s;candal is more or le&s;s odious to man|kind, and criminal in him&s;elf, as he is influenced by any one or more of the foregoing motives. But whatever may be the occa&s;ion of &s;preading the&s;e fal&s;e reports, he ought to con&s;ider, that the effect of them is equally preju|dicial
<PB N="36" REF="029518_0019_0FE1CBF6DE0DD130">
and pernicious to the per&s;on at whom they are aimed. The injury is the &s;ame, though the principle from whence it proceeds may be different.</P>
<P>As every one looks upon him&s;elf with too much indul|gence when he pa&s;&s;es a judgment on his own thoughts of actions; and as very few would be thought guilty of this abominable proceeding, which is &s;o univer&s;ally practi&s;ed, and, at the &s;ame time, &s;o univer&s;ally blamed, I &s;hall lay down three rules, by which I would have a man examine and &s;earch into his own heart, before he &s;tands acquitted to him&s;elf of that evil di&s;po&s;ition of mind which I am here mentioning.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Let him con&s;ider whether he does not take de|light in hearing the faults of others.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Whether he is not too apt to believe &s;uch lit|tle blackening accounts, and more inclined to be cred|ulous on the uncharitable than on the good natured &s;ide.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Whether he is not ready to &s;pread and propa|gate &s;uch reports as tend to the di&s;reputation of another.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the &s;everal &s;teps by which this vice proceeds, and grows up into &s;lander and defamation.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, a man who takes delight in hearing the faults of others, &s;hews &s;ufficiently that he has a true reli&s;h of &s;candal, and con&s;equently the &s;eeds of this vice within him. If his mind is gratified with hearing the reproaches which are ca&s;t on others, he will find the &s;ame plea&s;ure in relating them, and be the more apt to do it, as he will naturally imagine every one he conver|&s;es with is delighted in the &s;ame manner with him&s;elf. A man &s;hould endeavour therefore to wear out of his mind this criminal curio&s;ity, which is perpetually heigh|tened and inflamed by li&s;tening to &s;uch &s;tories as tend to the di&s;reputation of others.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd place, a man &s;hould con&s;ult his own heart, whether he is not apt to <HI>believe</HI> &s;uch little black|ening accounts; and more inclined to be credulous on the uncharitable, than on the good-natured &s;ide.</P>
<P>Such a credulity is very vicious in it&s;elf, and generally ari&s;es from a man's con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own &s;ecret cor|ruptions. It is a pretty &s;aying of <HI>Thales,</HI> Fal&s;ehood is ju&s;t as far di&s;tant from truth, as the ears are from the eyes. By which he would intimate, that a wi&s;e man
<PB N="37" REF="029518_0019_0FE1CBF6DE0DD130">
&s;hould not ea&s;ily give credit to the reports of actions which he has not &s;een. I &s;hall, under this head, mention two or three remarkable rules to be ob&s;erved by the members of the celebrated Abbe <HI>de la Trappe,</HI> as they are publi&s;hed in a little <HI>French</HI> book.</P>
<P>The fathers are there ordered, never to give an ear to any accounts of ba&s;e or criminal actions; to turn off all &s;uch di&s;cour&s;e if po&s;&s;ible; but in ca&s;e they hear any thing of this nature &s;o well atte&s;ted that they cannot di&s;believe it, they are then to &s;uppo&s;e that the criminal actions may have proceeded from a good intention in him who is guilty of it. This is perhaps carrying chari|ty to an extravagance; but it is certainly much more lau|dable, than to &s;uppo&s;e, as the ill-natured part of the world does, that indifferent and even good actions pro|ceed from bad principles and wrong intentions.</P>
<P>In the third place, a man &s;hould examine his heart, whether he does not find in it a &s;ecret inclination to propagate &s;uch reports as tend to the di&s;repuation of another.</P>
<P>When the di&s;ea&s;e of the mind, which I have hitherto been &s;peaking of, ari&s;es to this degree of malignity, it di&s;covers it&s;elf in its wor&s;t &s;ymptoms, and is in danger of becoming incurable. I need not therefore in&s;i&s;t upon the guilt in this la&s;t particular, which every one cannot but di&s;approve, who is not void of humanity, or even common di&s;cretion; I &s;hall only add, whatever plea&s;ure any man may take in &s;preading whi&s;pers of this nature, he will find an infinitely greater &s;atisfaction in conquer|ing the temptation he is under, by letting the &s;ecret die within his own brea&s;t.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I HAVE always preferred cheerfulne&s;s to mirth. The latter I con&s;ider as an act, the former as an habit of the mind. Mirth is &s;hort and tran&s;ient; cheerfulne&s;s fixed and permanent. Tho&s;e are often rai&s;ed into the greate&s;t tran&s;ports of mirth, who are &s;ubject to the great|e&s;t depre&s;&s;ions of melancholy. On the contrary, cheer|fulne&s;s,
<PB N="38" REF="029518_0020_0FE1CBF882DACDF0">
though it does not give the mind &s;uch an exqui|&s;ite gladne&s;s, prevents us from falling into any depths of &s;orrow. Mirth is like a fla&s;h of lightning, that breaks through a gloom of clouds, and glitters for a moment; cheerfulne&s;s keeps up a kind of day-light in the mind, and fills it with a &s;teady and perpetual &s;erenity.</P>
<P>Men of au&s;tere principles look upon mirth as too wanton and di&s;&s;olute for a &s;tate of probation, and as filled with a certain triumph and in&s;olence of heart that is incon&s;i&s;tent with a life which is every moment obnoxious to the greate&s;t dangers. Writers of this complexion have ob&s;erved, that the &s;acred Per&s;on, who was the great pattern of perfection, was never &s;een to laugh.</P>
<P>Cheerfulne&s;s of mind is not liable to any of the&s;e ex|ceptions: it is of a &s;erious and compo&s;ed nature, it does not throw the mind into a condition improper for the pre&s;ent &s;tate of humanity, and is very con&s;picuous in the character of tho&s;e who are looked upon as the greate&s;t philo&s;ophers among the heathens, as well as among tho&s;e who have been de&s;ervedly e&s;teemed as &s;aints and holy men among Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider cheerfulne&s;s in three lights, with regard to our&s;elves, to tho&s;e we conver&s;e with, and to the great Author of our being, it will not a little recommend it&s;elf on each of tho&s;e accounts. The man who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this excellent frame of mind, is not only ea&s;y in his thoughts, but a perfect ma&s;ter of all the powers and fac|ulties of his &s;oul: his imagination is always clear, and his judgment undi&s;turbed: his temper is even and un|ruffled, whether in action or &s;olitude: He comes with a reli&s;h of all tho&s;e goods which nature has provided for him, ta&s;tes all the plea&s;ures of the creation which are poured about him, and does not feel the full weight of tho&s;e accidental evils which may befal him.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider him in relation to the per&s;ons whom he conver&s;es with, it naturally produces love and good-will towards him. A cheerful mind is not only di&s;po&s;ed to be affable and obliging, but rai&s;es the &s;ame good humour in tho&s;e who come within its influence. A man finds him&s;elf plea&s;ed, he does not know why, with the cheer|fulne&s;s of his companions: it is like a &s;udden &s;un-&s;hine that awakens a &s;ecret delight in the mind without attend|ing to it. The heart rejoices of its own accord, and
<PB N="39" REF="029518_0020_0FE1CBF882DACDF0">
naturally flows out into friend&s;hip and benevolence to|wards the per&s;on who has &s;o kindly an effect upon it.</P>
<P>When I con&s;ider this cheerful &s;tate of mind in its third relation, I cannot but look upon it as a con&s;tant habitual gratitude to the great Author of nature. An inward cheerfulne&s;s is an implicit prai&s;e and thank&s;giv|ing to Providence under its di&s;pen&s;ations. It is a kind of acquie&s;cence in the &s;tate wherein we are placed, and a &s;ecret approbation of the divine will in his conduct to|wards man.</P>
<P>There are but two things, which, in my opinion, can rea&s;onably deprive us of this cheerfulne&s;s of heart. The fir&s;t of the&s;e is the &s;en&s;e of guilt. A man who lives in a &s;tate of vice and impenitence, can have no title to that evenne&s;s and tranquillity of mind, which is the health of the &s;oul, and the natural effect of virtue and innocence. Cheerfulne&s;s in an ill man de&s;erves a harder name than language can furni&s;h us with, and as many degrees be|yond what we commonly call folly and madne&s;s.</P>
<P>Athei&s;m, by which I mean a di&s;belief of the &s;upreme Being, and con&s;equently of a future &s;tate, under what|&s;oever title it &s;helters it&s;elf, may likewi&s;e very rea&s;onably deprive a man of his cheerfulne&s;s of temper. There is &s;omething &s;o particularly gloomy and offen&s;ive to hu|man nature in the pro&s;pect of non-exi&s;tence, that I can|not but wonder, with many excellent writers, how it is po&s;&s;ible for a man to out-live the expectation of it. For my own part, I think the being of a God is &s;o little to be doubted, that it is almo&s;t the only truth we are &s;ure of, and &s;uch a truth as we meet with in every object, in eve|ry occurrence, and in every thought. If we look into the character of this tribe of infidels, we generally find, they are made up of pride, &s;pleen, and cavil. It is in|deed no wonder, that men, who are unea&s;y to them&s;elves, &s;hould be &s;o to the re&s;t of the world; and how is it po&s;|&s;ible for a man to be otherwi&s;e than unea&s;y in him&s;elf, when he is in danger every moment of lo&s;ing his entire exi&s;tence, and dropping into nothing!</P>
<P>The vicious man and Athei&s;t have therefore no pre|tence to cheerfulne&s;s, and would act very unrea&s;onably, &s;hould they endeavour at it. It is impo&s;&s;ible for any one to live in good humour, and enjoy his pre&s;ent exi&s;t|ence, who is apprehen&s;ive either of torment, or annihila|tion; of being mi&s;erable, or of not being at all.</P>

After having mentioned the&s;e two great principles which are de&s;tructive of cheerfulne&s;s in their own nature, as well as in right rea&s;on, I cannot think of any other that ought to bani&s;h this happy temper from a virtuous mind. Pain and &s;ickne&s;s, &s;hame and reproach, poverty and old age, nay death it&s;elf, con&s;idering the &s;hortne&s;s of their duration, and the advantage we may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> from them, do not de&s;erve the name of evils. A good mind may bear up under them with fortitude, with patience, and with cheerfulne&s;s of heart. The to&s;&s;ing of a tem|pe&s;t, does not di&s;compo&s;e him, who is &s;ure it will bring him to a joyful harbour.</P>
<P>A man who u&s;es his be&s;t endeavours to live according to the dictates of virtue and right rea&s;on, has two per|petual &s;ources of cheerfulne&s;s; in the con&s;ideration of his own nature, and of that Being on whom he has a de|pendence. If he look into him&s;elf, he cannot but re|joice in that exi&s;tence, which is &s;o lately be&s;towed upon him, and which, after millions of ages, will be &s;till new, and &s;till in its beginning. How many &s;elf-congratula|tions naturally ari&s;e in the mind when it reflects on this its entrance into eternity, when it takes a view of tho&s;e improveable faculties, which in a few years, and even at his fir&s;t &s;etting out, have made &s;o con&s;iderable a prog|re&s;s and which will be &s;till receiving an increa&s;e of perfection, and con&s;equently an increa&s;e of happine&s;s! The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;uch a Being &s;preads a perpetual diffu&s;ion of joy through the &s;oul of a virtuous man, and makes him look upon him&s;elf every moment as more happy than he knows how to conceive.</P>
<P>The &s;econd &s;ource of cheerfulne&s;s to a good mind, is its con&s;ideration of that Being on whom we have our dependence, and in whom, though we behold him, as yet but in the fir&s;t faint di&s;coveries of his perfections, we &s;ee every thing that we can imagine as great, glorious, or amiable. We find our&s;elves every where upheld by his goodne&s;s, and &s;urrounded with an immen&s;ity of love and mercy. In &s;hort, we depend upon a Being, who&s;e power qualifies him to make us happy by an infinity of means, who&s;e goodne&s;s and truth engage him to make tho <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> happy who de&s;ire it of him, and who&s;e unchangeablene&s;s will &s;ecure us in this happine&s;s to all eternity.</P>

<P>CHEERFULNESS is, in the fir&s;t place, the be&s;t promoter of health. Repinings, and &s;ecret murmurs of heart, give imperceptible &s;trokes to tho&s;e delicate fibres of which the vital parts are compo&s;ed, and wear out the machine in&s;en&s;ibly; not to mention tho&s;e violent ferments which they &s;tir up in the blood, and tho&s;e irregular, di&s;turbed motions which they rai&s;e in the animal &s;pirits. I &s;carce remember; in my own ob&s;ervations, to have met with many old men, or with &s;uch who, (to u&s;e our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> phra&s;e) <HI>wear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">well,</HI> that had not at lea&s;t a certain indo|lence in their humour, if not a more than ordinary gaiety and cheerfulne&s;s of heart. The truth of it is, health and cheerfulne&s;s mutually beget each other; with this difference, that we &s;eldom meet with a great degree of health which is not attended with a certain cheerful|ne&s;s, but very often &s;ee cheerfulne&s;s where there is no great degree of health.</P>
<P>Cheerfulne&s;s bears the &s;ame friendly regard to the mind as to the body: it bani&s;hes all anxious care and di&s;content, &s;oothes and compo&s;es the pa&s;&s;ions, and keeps the &s;oul in a perpetual calm. But having already touch|ed on this la&s;t con&s;ideration, I &s;hall here take notice, that the world in which we are placed is filled with innumer|able objects, that are proper to rai&s;e and keep alive this happy temper of mind.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider the world in its &s;ub&s;erviency to man, one would think it was made for our u&s;e; but if we con|&s;ider
<PB N="42" REF="029518_0022_0FE1CC05BA4BACF0">
it in its natural beauty and harmony, one would be apt to conclude it was made for our plea&s;ure. The &s;un, which is as the great &s;oul of the univer&s;e, and produces all the nece&s;&s;aries of life, has a particular influence in cheering the mind of man, and making the heart glad.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e &s;everal living creatures which are made for our &s;ervice or &s;u&s;tenance, at the &s;ame time either fill the woods with their mu&s;ic, furni&s;h us with game, or rai&s;e plea&s;ing ideas in us by the delightfulne&s;s of their appearance. Fountains, lakes, and rivers, are as refre&s;hing to the im|agination, as to the &s;oil through which they pa&s;s.</P>
<P>There are writers of great di&s;tinction, who have made it an argument for Providence, that the whole earth is covered with green, rather than with any other colour, as being &s;uch a right mixture of light and &s;hade, that it comforts and &s;trengthens the eye, in&s;tead of weakening or grieving it. For this rea&s;on, &s;everal painters have a green cloth hanging near them, to ea&s;e the eye upon, after too great an application to their colouring. A fa|mous modern philo&s;opher accounts for it in the follow|ing manner: all colours that are more luminous, over|power and di&s;&s;ipate the animal &s;pirits which are employ|ed in &s;ight; on the contrary, tho&s;e that are more ob|&s;cure, do not give the animal &s;pirits a &s;ufficient exerci&s;e; whereas the rays that produce in us the idea of green, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">all upon the eye in &s;uch a due proportion, that they give the animal &s;pirits their proper play, and by keeping up the &s;truggle in a ju&s;t balance, excite a very plea&s;ing and agreeable &s;en&s;ation. Let the cau&s;e be what it will, the effect is certain; for which rea&s;on the poets a&s;cribe to this particular colour the epithet of <HI>cheerful.</HI></P>
<P>To con&s;ider farther this double end in the works of nature, and how they are at the &s;ame time both u&s;eful and entertaining, we find that the mo&s;t important parts in the vegetable world are tho&s;e which are the mo&s;t beau|tiful. The&s;e are the &s;eeds by which the &s;everal races of plants are propagated and continued, and which are al|ways lodged in flowers or blo&s;&s;oms. Nature &s;eems to hide her principal de&s;ign, and to be indu&s;trious in ma|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing the earth gay and delightful, while &s;he is carrying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> her great work, and intent upon her own pre&s;erva|tion. The hu&s;bandman, after the &s;ame manner, is em|ployed in laying out the whole country into a kind of
<PB N="43" REF="029518_0022_0FE1CC05BA4BACF0">
garden or land&s;cape, and making every thing &s;mile about him, whil&s;t, in reality, he thinks of nothing but of the harve&s;t and increa&s;e which is to ari&s;e from it.</P>
<P>We may further ob&s;erve, how Providence has taken care to keep up this cheerfulne&s;s in the mind of man, by having formed it after &s;uch a manner as to make it capa|ble of conceiving delight from &s;everal objects which &s;eem to have very little u&s;e in them; as from the wildne&s;s of rocks and de&s;arts, and the like grote&s;que parts of nature. Tho&s;e who are ver&s;ed in philo&s;ophy may &s;till carry this con&s;ideration higher, by ob&s;erving, that if matter had appeared to us endowed only with tho&s;e real qualities which it actually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, it would have made but a very joyle&s;s and uncomfortable figure; and why has Provi|dence given it a power of producing in us impre&s;&s;ions of &s;uch imaginary qualities as ta&s;tes and colours, &s;ounds and &s;mells, heat and cold; but that man, while he is conver&s;ant in the lower &s;tations of nature, might have his mind cheered and delighted with agreeable &s;en&s;a|tions? In &s;hort, the whole univer&s;e is a kind of theatre, filled with objects that either rai&s;e in us plea&s;ure, amu&s;e|ment, or admiration.</P>
<P>The reader's own thoughts will &s;ugge&s;t to him the vici&s;&s;itude of day and night, the change of &s;ea&s;ons, with all that variety of &s;cenes which diver&s;ify the face of nature, and fill the mind with a perpetual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of beautiful and plea&s;ing images.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not here mention the &s;everal entertainments of art, with the plea&s;ures of friend&s;hip, books, conver&s;ation, and other accidental diver&s;ions of life, becau&s;e I would only take notice of &s;uch incitements to a cheerful temper as offer them&s;elves to per&s;ons of all ranks and conditions, and which may &s;ufficiently &s;hew us, that Providence did not de&s;ign this world &s;hould be filled with murmurs and repinings, or that the heart of man &s;hould be involved in gloom and melancholy.</P>
<P>I the more inculcate this cheerfulne&s;s of temper, as it is a virtue in which our countrymen are ob&s;erved to be more deficient than any other nation. Melancholy is a Kind of demon that haunts our i&s;land, and often conveys it&s;elf to us in an ea&s;terly wind. A celebrated <HI>French</HI> Noveli&s;t, in oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e who begin their romances with the flowery &s;ea&s;on of the year enters on his &s;tory,

<P>Every one ought to fence again&s;t the temper of his cli|mate or con&s;titution, and frequently to indulge in him&s;elf tho&s;e con&s;iderations which may give him a &s;erenity of mind, and enable him to bear up cheerfully again&s;t tho&s;e little evils and misfortunes which are common to human nature, and which, by a right improvement of them, will produce a &s;atiety of joy, and an uninterrupted happine&s;s.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time that I would engage my reader to con&s;ider the world in its mo&s;t agreeable lights, I mu&s;t own there are many evils which naturally &s;pring up amid&s;t the entertainments that are provided for us; but the&s;e if rightly con&s;idered, &s;hould be far from overca&s;ting the mind with &s;orrow, or de&s;troying that cheerfulne&s;s of temper, which I have been recommending. This inter&s;per&s;ion of evil with good, and pain with plea&s;ure, in the works of nature, is very truly a&s;cribed by Mr. <HI>Locke,</HI> in his E&s;&s;ay on Human Under&s;tanding, to a moral rea&s;on, in the following words:</P>
<P><HI>Beyond all this, we may find another rea&s;on</HI> why <HI>God hath &s;cattered up and down</HI> &s;everal degrees of plea&s;ure and pain, in all the things that environ and affect us, <HI>and blended them together, in almo&s;t all that our thoughts and &s;en&s;es have to do with; that we, finding imperfection, di&s;&s;atisfaction, and went of complete happine&s;s in all the enjoyments which the creatures can afford us, might be led to &s;eek it in the enjoyment of Him,</HI> with whom there is fulne&s;s of joy, and at who&s;e right hand are plea&s;ures for evermore.</P>

<P>I OUGHT hourly to be looking up with gratitude and prai&s;e to the Creator of my being, for having formed me of a di&s;po&s;ition that throws off every particle of &s;pleen, and either directs my attention to objects of cheerfulne&s;s and joy, or enables me to look upon their contraries as I do on &s;hades in a picture, which add force to the lights, and beauty to the whole. With this hap|pine&s;s of con&s;titution I can behold the luxury of the
<PB N="45" REF="029518_0023_0FE1CC08FB36CC58">
times, as giving food and clothing to the hungry and the naked; extending our commerce, and promoting and encouraging the liberal arts. I can look upon the horrors of war, as productive of the ble&s;&s;ings and enjoy|ments of peace; and upon the mi&s;eries of mankind, which I cannot relieve, with a thankful heart that my own lot has been more favourable.</P>
<P>There is a pa&s;&s;age in that truly original poem, called the <HI>Spleen,</HI> which plea&s;es me more than almo&s;t any thing I have read. The pa&s;&s;age is this:
<Q><L><HI>Happy the man who innocent,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Grieves not at ills be can't prevent;</HI></L>
<L><HI>His &s;kiff does with the current glide,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Nor puffing pull'd again&s;t the tide:</HI></L>
<L><HI>He, paddling by the &s;cuffling crowd,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Sees unconcern'd life's wager row'd;</HI></L>
<L><HI>And when he can't prevent foul play,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Enjoys the follies of the fray.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>The laughing philo&s;opher has always appeared to me a more eligible character than the weeping one: but be|fore I &s;it down either to laugh or to cry at the follies of mankind, as I have publicly enli&s;ted my&s;elf in their &s;er|vice, it becomes me to admini&s;ter every thing in my power to relieve or cure them. For this purpo&s;e I &s;hall here lay before my readers &s;ome loo&s;e hints on a &s;ubject, which will, I hope, excite their attention, and contribute towards the expelling from the heart tho&s;e malignant and &s;ullen humours, which de&s;troy the harmony of &s;ocial life.</P>
<P>If we make ob&s;ervations on human nature, either from what we feel in our&s;elves, or &s;ee in others, we &s;hall per|ceive that almo&s;t all the unea&s;ine&s;&s;es of mankind owe their ri&s;e to inactivity or idlene&s;s of body or mind. A free and bri&s;k circulation of the blood is ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary towards the creating ea&s;ine&s;s and good humour; and is the only means of &s;ecuring us from a re&s;tle&s;s train of idle thoughts, which cannot fail to make us burthen&s;ome to our&s;elves, and di&s;&s;atisfied with all about us.</P>
<P>Providence has therefore wi&s;ely provided for the gener|ality of mankind, by compelling them to u&s;e that labour which not only procures them the nece&s;&s;aries of life, but peace and health to enjoy them with delight. Nay far|ther,
<PB N="46" REF="029518_0024_0FE1CC0A9C91E760">
we find how e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary it is that the greate&s;t part of mankind &s;hould be obliged to earn their bread by labour, from the ill u&s;e that is almo&s;t univer&s;ally made of tho&s;e riches which exempt men from it. Even the advantages of the be&s;t education are generally found to be in&s;ufficient to keep us within the limits of rea&s;on and moderation. How hard do the very be&s;t of men find it, to force upon them&s;elves that ab&s;tinence or labour which the narrowne&s;s of their circum&s;tances does not immediately compel them to? Is there really one in ten, who, by all the advantages of wealth and lei&s;ure, is made more happy in re&s;pect to him&s;elf, or more u&s;eful to mankind? What numbers do we daily &s;ee of &s;uch per|&s;ons, either rioting in luxury, or &s;leeping in &s;loth, for one who makes a proper u&s;e of the advantages which riches give for the improvement of him&s;elf, or the hap|pine&s;s of others! And how many do we meet with, who, for their abu&s;e of the ble&s;&s;ings of life, are given up to perpetual unea&s;ine&s;s of mind, and to the greate&s;t agonies of bodily pain?</P>
<P>Whoever &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;iders this point, will di&s;cover, that riches are by no means &s;uch certain ble&s;&s;ings as the poor imagine them to be: on the contrary, he will per|ceive, that the common labours and employments of life are much better &s;uited to the majority of mankind, than pro&s;perity and abundance would be without them.</P>
<P>It was a merciful &s;entence which the Creator pa&s;&s;ed on man for his di&s;obedience, <HI>By the &s;weat of thy face thou &s;halt eat thy bread;</HI> for to the puni&s;hment it&s;elf he &s;tands indebted for health, &s;trength, and all the enjoyments of life. Though the fir&s;t paradi&s;e was forfeited for his tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ion, yet by the penalty inflicted for that tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion the earth is made into a paradi&s;e again, in the beautiful fields and gardens which we &s;ee daily produced by the labour of man.</P>
<P>And though the ground was pronounced cur&s;ed for his di&s;obedience, yet is that cur&s;e &s;o ordered, as to be the puni&s;hment, chiefly and almo&s;t &s;olely of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e, who, by intemperance or &s;loth, inflict it upon them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Even from the wants and weakne&s;&s;es of mankind are the bonds of mutual &s;upport and affection derived. The nece&s;&s;ities of each, which no man him&s;elf can &s;ufficiently &s;upply, compel him to contribute towards the benefit of others; and while he labours only for his own advantage, he is promoting the univer&s;al good of all around him.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="029518_0024_0FE1CC0A9C91E760">
Health is the ble&s;&s;ing that every one wi&s;hes to enjoy; but the multitude are &s;o unrea&s;onable, as to de&s;ire to purcha&s;e it at a cheaper rate than it is to be obtained. The continuance of it is only to be &s;ecured by exerci&s;e or labour. But the misfortune is, that the poor are too apt to overlook their own enjoyments, and to view with envy the ea&s;e and affluence of their &s;uperiors, not con&s;idering that the u&s;ual attendants upon great fortunes are anxiety and di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>If it be true, that tho&s;e per&s;ons are the happie&s;t who have the fewe&s;t wants, the rich man is more the object of compa&s;&s;ion than envy. However moderate his inclina|tions may be, the cu&s;tom of the world lays him under a kind of nece&s;&s;ity of living up to his fortune. He mu&s;t be &s;urrounded by an u&s;ele&s;s train of &s;ervants: his appetite mu&s;t be palled with plenty, and his peace invaded by crowds. He mu&s;t give up the plea&s;ures and endearments of dome&s;tic life, to be the &s;lave and party of faction. Or, if the goodne&s;s of his heart &s;hould incline him to acts of humanity and benevolence, he will have the frequent mortification of &s;eeing his charities ill be&s;towed; and by his inability to relieve all, the con&s;tant one of making more enemies by his refu&s;als, than friends by his benefac|tions. If we add to the&s;e con&s;iderations a truth, which I believe few per&s;ons will di&s;pute, namely, that the greate&s;t fortunes, by adding to the wants of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, u&s;ually render them the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;itous of men, we &s;hall find greatne&s;s and happine&s;s to be at a wide di&s;tance from one another. If we carry our inquiries &s;till higher; if we examine into the &s;tate of a King, and even enthrone him, like our own, in the hearts of his people; if the life of a father be a life of care and anxiety, to be the father of a people is a pre-eminence to be honored, but not envied.</P>
<P>This happine&s;s of life is, I believe, generally to be found in tho&s;e &s;tations, which neither totally &s;ubject men to labour, nor ab&s;olutely exempt them from it. Power is the parent of di&s;quietude, ambition of di&s;appointment, and riches of di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>I will conclude the&s;e reflections with the following fable:</P>
<Q><P>Labour, the offspring of want, and the mother of Health and Contentment, lived with her two daughters in a little cottage by the &s;ide of a hill, at a great di&s;tance from town. They were totally unacquainted with
<PB N="48" REF="029518_0025_0FE1CC0C3B04E300">
the great, and had kept no better company than the neighbouring villagers: but having a de&s;ire of &s;eeing the world, they for&s;ook their companions and habita|tion, and determined to travel. Labour went &s;oberly along the road, with Health on her right hand, who, by the &s;prightline&s;s of her conver&s;ation, and &s;ongs of cheerfulne&s;s and joy, &s;oftened the toils of the way; while Contentment went &s;miling on the left, &s;upporting the &s;teps of her mother, and, by her perpetual good humour, increa&s;ing the vivacity of her &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>In this manner they travelled over fore&s;ts, and through towns and villages, till at la&s;t they arrived at the capital of the kingdom. At their entrance into the great city, the mother conjured her daughters never to lo&s;e fight of her; for it was the will of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> &s;he &s;aid, that their &s;eparation &s;hould be attended with the utter ruin of all three; but Health was of too gay a di&s;po&s;i|tion to regard the coun&s;els of Labour: &s;he &s;uffered her|&s;elf to be debauched by Intemperance, and at la&s;t died in childbed of Di&s;ea&s;e. Contentment, in the ab&s;ence of her &s;i&s;ter, gave her&s;elf up to the enticements of Sloth, and was never heard of after: while Labour, who could have no enjoyment without her daughters, went every where in &s;earch of them, till &s;he was at la&s;t &s;eized by a la&s;&s;itude in her way, and died in mi&s;ery.</P></Q>

They were originally alike in temper too; but by different management are grown the rever&s;e of each other. <HI>Arachne</HI> has accu&s;tom|ed her&s;elf to look only on the dark &s;ide of every object. If a new play or poem makes its appearance, with a thou|&s;and brilliancies, and but one or two blemi&s;hes, &s;he &s;lightly &s;kims, over the pa&s;&s;ages that &s;hould give her plea&s;ure, and dwells upon tho&s;e only that fill her with di&s;like. If you &s;hew her a very excellent portrait, &s;he looks at &s;ome part of the drapery that has been neglected, or to a hand or finger which has been left unfini&s;hed. Her garden is a very beautiful one, and kept with great neatne&s;s and elegance; but if you take a walk with her into it, &s;he talks to you of nothing but blights and &s;torms, of &s;nails and catterpillars, and how impo&s;&s;ible it is to keep it from the litter of falling leaves, and worm ca&s;ts. If you &s;it down in one of her temples, to enjoy a delight|ful pro&s;pect, &s;he ob&s;erves to you, that there is too much wood, or too little water; that the day is too &s;unny, or too gloomy; that it is &s;ultry or windy; and fini&s;hes with a long harangue upon the wretchedne&s;s of our climate. When you return with her to the company, in hopes of a cheerful conver&s;ation, &s;he ca&s;ts a gloom over all, by giving you the hi&s;tory of her own bad health, or of &s;ome melancholy accident that has befallen one of her daughter's children. Thus, &s;he in&s;en&s;ibly &s;inks her own &s;pirits, and the &s;pirits of all around her, and at la&s;t di&s;covers, &s;he knows not why, that her friends are grave.</P>
<P><HI>Meli&s;&s;a</HI> is the rever&s;e of all this. By con&s;tantly habit|uating her&s;elf to look only on the bright &s;ide of objects, &s;he pre&s;erves a perpetual cheerfulne&s;s in her&s;elf, which, by a kind of happy contagion, &s;he communicates to all about her. If any misfortune has befallen her, &s;he con|&s;iders it might have been wor&s;e, and is thankful to Prov|idence for an e&s;cape. She rejoices in &s;olitude, as it gives her an opportunity of knowing her&s;elf; and in &s;ociety, becau&s;e &s;he can communicate the happine&s;s &s;he enjoys. She oppo&s;es every man's virtues to his failings, and can find out &s;omething to cheri&s;h and applaud in the very wor&s;t of her acquaintance. She opens every book with a de&s;ire to be entertained or in&s;tructed, and therefore &s;el|dom
<PB N="50" REF="029518_0026_0FE1CC185ADB2328">
mi&s;&s;es what &s;he looks for. Walk with her, though it he but on a heath or a common, and &s;he will di&s;cover numberle&s;s beauties unob&s;erved before in the hills, the dales, the brooks, brakes, and the variegated flowers of weeds and poppies. She enjoys every change of weather and of &s;ea&s;on, as bringing with it &s;omething of health or convenience. In conver&s;ation, it is a rule with her, never to &s;tart a &s;ubject that leads to any thing gloomy o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> di&s;agreeable; you therefore never hear her repeating her own grievances, or tho&s;e of her neighbours, or (what is wor&s;t of all) their faults and imperfections. If any thing of the latter kind be mentioned in her hearing, &s;he has the addre&s;s to turn it into entertainment, by changing the mo&s;t odious railing into plea&s;ant raillery. Thus <HI>Meli&s;&s;a</HI> like the bee, gathers honey from every weed; while <HI>Arachne,</HI> like the &s;pider, &s;ucks poi&s;on from the faire&s;t flowers. The con&s;equence is, that of two tempers, once very nearly allied, the one is for ever &s;our and di&s;&s;atisfied, the other always gay and cheerful: the one &s;preads an univer&s;al gloom; the other a continual &s;un&s;hine.</P>
<P>There is nothing more worthy of our attention th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> this art of happine&s;s. In conver&s;ation as well as life, happine&s;s very often depends upon the &s;lighte&s;t inci|dents. The taking notice of the badne&s;s of the weather, a north-ea&s;t wind, the approach of winter or any trifling circum&s;tance of the di&s;agreeable kind, &s;hall in&s;en&s;ibly rob a whole company of its good humour, and fling every member of it into the vapours. If, therefore, we would be happy in our&s;elves, and are de&s;irous of communica|ting that happine&s;s to all about us, the&s;e <HI>minutiae</HI> of con|ver&s;ation ought carefully to be attended to. The bright|ne&s;s of the &s;ky, the lengthening of the days, the increa|&s;ing verdure of the &s;pring, the arrival of any little piece of good news, or whatever carries with it the mo&s;t di&s;tant glimp&s;e of joy, &s;hall frequently be the parent of a &s;ocial and happy conver&s;ation. Good manners exact from us this regard for our company. The clown may repine at the &s;un&s;hine that ripens his harve&s;t, becau&s;e his turnips are burnt up by it; but the man of refinement will ex|tract plea&s;ure from the thunder &s;torm to which he is ex|po&s;ed, by remarking on the plenty and refre&s;hment which may be expected from &s;uch a &s;hower.</P>
<P>That does good manners, as well as good &s;en&s;e, direct
<PB N="51" REF="029518_0026_0FE1CC185ADB2328">
us to look at every object on the bright &s;ide; and by thus acting, we cheri&s;h and improve both the one and the other. By this practice it is that <HI>Meli&s;&s;a</HI> is become the wi&s;e&s;t and the be&s;t-bred woman living; and by this prac|tice may every man and woman arrive at that ea&s;y benev|olence of temper, which the world calls Good Nature, and the &s;cripture Charity, who&s;e natural and never-Fail|ing fruit is Happine&s;s.</P>

<P>A FRENCH author, giving an account of a very agreeable man, in who&s;e character he mingles good qualities and infirmities, rather than vices and virtues, tells the following &s;tory:</P>
<P>"Our author, &s;ays he, was pretty much addicted to the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable of all faults. He had a loo&s;e rogue for a lacquey, not a little in his favour, though he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> other name for him when he &s;poke of him but <HI>the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> or to him but <HI>Sirrah.</HI> One morning when he was dre&s;&s;ing, Sirrah, &s;ays he, be &s;ure you bring home this evening a pretty wench. The fellow was a per&s;on of diligence and capacity, and had for &s;ome time addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to a decayed old gentlewoman, who had a young maiden to her daughter, beauteous as an angel, not &s;ixteen years of age. The mother's extreme poverty, and the in&s;inuations of this artful lacquey, concerning the &s;oft di&s;po&s;ition, and genero&s;ity of his ma&s;ter, made her con&s;ent to deliver up her daughter. But many were the intreaties and repre&s;entations of the mother to gain the child's con&s;ent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> an action, which &s;he &s;aid, &s;he ab|horred, at the &s;ame time &s;he exhorted her to it&punc; but, child, &s;ays &s;he, can you &s;ee your mother die for hunger? The virgin argued no longer, but bur&s;ting into tears, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;he would go any where. The lacquey conveyed her with great ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s and &s;ecrecy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> his ma&s;ter's lodging, and placed her in a commodious apartment till he came home. The Knight, who knew his man never failed of bringing in his prey, indulged his genius at a banquet, and was in high humour at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> entertain|ment

with ladies, expecting to be, received in the even|ing by one as agreeable as the be&s;t of them. When he came home, his lacquey met him with a &s;aucy and joy|ful familiarity, crying out. She is as hand&s;ome as an angel, (for there is no other &s;imile on the&s;e occa&s;ions) but the tender fool has wept till her eyes are &s;welled and bloated; for &s;he is a maid and a gentlewoman. With that he conducted his ma&s;ter to the room where &s;he was, and retired. The Knight, when he &s;aw her bathed in tears, &s;aid in &s;ome &s;urprize, Do you not know, young woman, why you are brought hither? The unhappy maid fell on her knees, and with many interruptions of &s;ighs and tears &s;aid to him, I know, alas! too well, why I am brought hither: my mother, to get bread for her and my&s;elf, has &s;ent me to do what you plea&s;ed; but I wi&s;h it would plea&s;e Heaven I could die, before I am added to the number of tho&s;e mi&s;erable wretches who live without honour! With this reflection &s;he wept anew, and beat her bo&s;om. The Knight, &s;tepping back from her, &s;aid, I am not &s;o abandoned as to hurt your innocence again&s;t your will.</P>
<P>"The novelty of this accident &s;urpri&s;ed him into vir|tue; and covering the young maid with a cloak, he led her to a relation's hou&s;e, to who&s;e care he recommended her for that night. The next morning he &s;ent for her mother, and a&s;ked her if her daughter was a maid? The mother a&s;&s;ured him, that when &s;he delivered her to his &s;ervant, &s;he was a &s;tranger to man. Are you not then, replied the Knight, a wicked woman, to contrive the debauchery of your own child? She held down her face with fear and &s;hame, and in her confu&s;ion uttered &s;ome broken words concerning her poverty. To your &s;hame be it, &s;aid the gentleman, that you &s;hould relieve your|&s;elf from want by a much greater evil: your daughter is a fine young creature; do you know of none that ever &s;poke of her for a wife? The mother an&s;wered, There is an hone&s;t man in the neighbourhood that loves her, who has often &s;aid he would marry her with two hundred pounds. The Knight ordered his man to reckon out that &s;um, with an addition of fifty to buy the bride clothes, and fifty more as an help to her mother."</P>

<P>A DERVISE, venerable by his age, fell ill in the hou&s;e of a woman who had been long a widow, and lived in extreme poverty in the &s;uburbs of <HI>Bal&s;ora.</HI> He was &s;o touched with the care and zeal with which &s;he a&s;&s;i&s;ted him, that at his departure he &s;aid to her, I have remarked that you have wherewith to &s;ub&s;i&s;t alone, but that you have not &s;ub&s;i&s;tence enough to &s;hare it with your only &s;on the young <HI>Abdallah.</HI> If you will tru&s;t him to my care, I will endeavour to acknowledge, in his per&s;on, the obligations. I have to you for your care of me. The good woman received this propo&s;al with joy; and the Dervi&s;e departed with the young man, adverti&s;ing her, that they mu&s;t perform a journey which would la&s;t near two years. As they travelled, he kept him in affluence, gave him excellent in&s;tructions, cured him of a danger|ous di&s;ea&s;e with which he was attacked; in fine, he took the &s;ame care of him as if he had been his own &s;on. <HI>Abdallah</HI> a hundred times te&s;tified his gratitude to him for all his bounties; but the old man always an&s;wered, <Q>My &s;on, it is by actions that gratitude is proved; we &s;hall &s;ee, in a proper time and place, whether you are &s;o grateful as you pretend.</Q></P>
<P>One day, as they continued their travels, they found them&s;elves in a &s;olitary place, and the Dervi&s;e &s;aid to <HI>Abdallah,</HI> <Q>My &s;on, we are now at the end of our jour|ney; I &s;hall employ my prayers to obtain from heaven, that the earth may open and make an entrance wide enough to permit thee to de&s;cend into a place, where thou wilt find one of the greate&s;t trea&s;ures that the earth inclo&s;es in her bowels. Ha&s;t thou courage to de&s;cend into this &s;ubterraneous vault?</Q> continued he, <HI>Abdallah</HI> &s;wore to him, he might depend upon his obe|dience and zeal. Then the Dervi&s;e lighted a &s;mall fire.
<PB N="54" REF="029518_0028_0FE1CC1BA25FED40">
into which he ca&s;t a perfume: he read and prayed for &s;ome moments, after which the earth opened, and the Dervi&s;e &s;aid to him, <Q>Thou maye&s;t now enter, my dear <HI>Abdallah;</HI> remember that it is in thy power to do me a great &s;ervice; and that this is, perhaps, the only op|portunity tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> can&s;t ever have of te&s;tifying to me that thou art not ungrateful: do not let thy&s;elf be dazzled by all the riches thou wilt find there; think only of &s;eizing upon an iron candle&s;tick with twelve branches, which thou wilt find clo&s;e to a door, that is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to me; come up immediately, and bring it to me.</Q>&mdash;<HI>Abdallah</HI> promi&s;ed every thing, and de|&s;cended boldly into the vault. But forgetting what had been expre&s;sly recommended to him, whil&s;t he was filling his ve&s;t and his bo&s;om with gold and jewels, which this &s;ubterraneous vault inclo&s;ed in prodigious heaps, the opening by which he entered clo&s;ed of it&s;elf. He had, however, pre&s;ence of mind enough to &s;eize upon the iron candle&s;tick, which the Dervi&s;e had &s;o &s;trongly recommended to him; and though the &s;ituation he was in was very terrible, he did not abandon him&s;elf to de&s;|pair; and thinking only in what manner he &s;hould get out of a place which might become his grave, he thought that the vault had clo&s;ed only becau&s;e he had not follow|ed the order of the Dervi&s;e; he recalled to his memory the care and goodne&s;s he had loaded him with; reproach|ed him&s;elf with his ingratitude, and fini&s;hed his medita|tion by humbling him&s;elf before God. At length, after much pains and inquietude, he was fortunate enough to find a narrow pa&s;&s;age which led him out of this ob&s;cure cave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> though it was not till he had followed it a con&s;id|erable way, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e perceived a &s;mall opening covered with briars and thorns, through which he returned to the light of the &s;un. He looked on all &s;ides, to &s;ee if he could perceive the Dervi&s;e, but in vain; he de&s;igned to deliver to him the iron candle&s;tick he &s;o much wi&s;hed for, and formed a de&s;ign of quitting him, being rich enough with what he had taken out of the cavern, to live in affluence without his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Not perceiving the Dervi&s;e, nor remembering any of the places through which he had pa&s;&s;ed, he went on as fortune had directed him, and was extremely a&s;toni&s;hed to find him&s;elf oppo&s;ite to his mother's hou&s;e, which
<PB N="55" REF="029518_0028_0FE1CC1BA25FED40">
he imagined he was at a great di&s;tance from. She imme|diately inquired after the holy Dervi&s;e. <HI>Abdallah</HI> told her frankly what had happened to him, and the danger he had run to &s;atisfy his unrea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">onable de&s;ires; he after|wards &s;hewed her the riches with which he was loaded. His mother concluded, upon the &s;ight of them, that the Der|vi&s;e only de&s;igned to make trial of his courage and obedi|ence, and that they ought to make u&s;e of the happine&s;s which fortune had pre&s;ented to them; adding, that doubtle&s;s &s;uch was the intention of the holy Dervi&s;e. While they contemplated upon the&s;e trea&s;ures with avid|ity; while they were dazzled with the lu&s;tre of them, and formed a thou&s;and projects in con&s;equence of them, they all vani&s;hed away before their eyes. It was then that <HI>Abdallah</HI> &s;incerely reproached him&s;elf for his ingrat|itude and di&s;obedience; and perceiving that the iron candle&s;tick had re&s;i&s;ted the inchantment, or rather the ju&s;t puni&s;hment which tho&s;e de&s;erve who do not execute what they promi&s;e, he &s;aid, pro&s;trating him&s;elf&mdash;<Q>What has happened to me is ju&s;t; I have lo&s;t what I had no de&s;ign to re&s;tore, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d the candle&s;tick which I intended to deliver to the Dervi&s;e remains with me: it is a proof that it rightly belongs to him, and that the re&s;t was unju&s;tly acquired.</Q> As he fini&s;hed the&s;e words, he placed the candle&s;tick in the mid&s;t of their little hou&s;e.</P>
<P>When the night was come, without reflecting upon it, he placed the light in the candle&s;tick. Immediately they &s;aw a Dervi&s;e appear, who turned round for an hour, and di&s;appeared, after having thrown them an a&s;per. The candle&s;tick had twelve branches. <HI>Abdallah,</HI> who was meditating all the day upon what he had &s;een the night before, was willing to know what would happen the next night, if he put a light in each of them; he did &s;o, and twelve Dervi&s;es appeared that in&s;tant; they turn|ed round al&s;o for an hour, and each of them threw an a&s;per as they di&s;appeared. He repeated every day the &s;ame ceremony, which had always the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s, but he never could make it &s;ucceed more than once in twen|ty four hours. This trifling &s;um was enough to make his mother and him&s;elf &s;ub&s;i&s;t tolerably: there was a time when they would have de&s;ired no more to be happy; but it was not con&s;iderable enough to change their for|tune.

It is always dangerous for the imagination <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o be fixed upon the idea of riches. The &s;ight of what he be|lieved he &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s; the projects he had formed for the employment of it; all the&s;e things had left &s;uch pro|found traces in the mind of <HI>Abdallah,</HI> that nothing could efface them. Therefore, &s;eeing the &s;mall advantage he drew from the candle&s;tick, he re&s;olved to carry it back to the Dervi&s;e, in hopes that he might obtain of him the trea&s;ure he had &s;een, or at lea&s;t find again the riches which had vani&s;hed from their &s;ight, by re&s;toring to him a thing for which he te&s;tified &s;o earne&s;t a de&s;ire. He was &s;o fortunate as to remember his name, and that of the city where he inhabited.

able to think of any thing but the candle&s;tick, and what it had produced. <Q>I had it, &s;aid he, &s;o long in my power; <HI>Abounadar,</HI> without me, had never been the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of it: what ri&s;ks did I not run in the &s;ubterraneous vault? Why does he now po&s;&s;e&s;s this trea&s;ure of trea&s;ures? Becau&s;e I had the probity, or rather the folly, to bring it back to him. He profits by my labour, and the danger I have incurred in &s;o long a journey: and what does he give me in return? Two camels loaded with gold and jewels; in one moment the candle&s;tick will furni&s;h him with ten times as much. It is <HI>Abounadar</HI> who is ungrateful: what wrong &s;hall I do him in taking this candle&s;tick? None certainly; for he is rich: and what do I po&s;&s;e&s;s?</Q> The&s;e ideas determined him, at length, to make all po&s;&s;ible attempts to &s;eize upon the candle&s;tick. The thing was not difficult, <HI>Abounadar</HI> hav|ing tru&s;ted him with the keys of his magazines. He knew where the candle&s;tick was placed; he &s;eized upon it, hid it in the bottom of one of the &s;acks, which he filled with pieces of gold and other riches that he was allowed to take, and loaded it, as well as the re&s;t, upon his camels. He had no other eagerne&s;s now than for his departure; and after having ha&s;tily bid adieu to the generous <HI>Abouna|dar,</HI> he delivered him his keys, and departed with his hor&s;e, and &s;lave, and two camels.</P>
<P>When he was &s;ome days journey from <HI>Bal&s;ora,</HI> he &s;old his &s;lave, re&s;olving not to have a witne&s;s of his former poverty, nor of the &s;ource of his pre&s;ent riches. He bought another, and arrived without any ob&s;tacle, at his mother's, whom he would &s;carce look upon, &s;o much was he taken up with his trea&s;ure. His fir&s;t care was to place the loads of his camels, and the candle&s;tick, in the mo&s;t private room of the hou&s;e; and, in his impatience to feed his eyes with his great opulence, he placed lights imme|diately in the candle&s;tick: the twelve Dervi&s;es appearing, he gave each of them a blow with a cane with all his &s;trength, le&s;t he &s;hould be failing in the laws of the tali&s;|man: but he had not remarked that <HI>Abounadar,</HI> when he &s;truck them, had the cane in his left hand. <HI>Abdallah,</HI> by a natural motion, made u&s;e of his right; and the Der|vi&s;es, in&s;tead of becoming heaps of riches, immediately drew from beneath their robes each a formidable club, with which they &s;truck him &s;o hard and &s;o long, that they

left him almo&s;t dead, and di&s;appeared, carrying with them all his trea&s;ure, the camels, the hor&s;e, the &s;lave, and the candle&s;tick.</P>
<P>Thus was <HI>Abdallah</HI> puni&s;hed by poverty, and almo&s;t by death; for his unrea&s;onable ambition, which perhaps might have been pardonable, if it had not been accom|panied by an ingratitude as wicked as it was audacious; &s;ince he had not &s;o much as the re&s;ource of being able to conceal his perfidies from the too piercing eyes of his benefactor.</P>

<P>THERE is not a common &s;aying which has a better turn of &s;en&s;e in it, than what we often hear in the mouths of the vulgar, that <HI>cu&s;tom is a &s;econd nature.</HI> It is indeed able to form the man a new, and give him inclina|tions and capacities altogether different from tho&s;e he was born with. Dr. <HI>Plot,</HI> in his hi&s;tory of <HI>Stafford&s;hire,</HI> tells us of an idiot that chanced to live within the &s;ound of a clock, and always amu&s;ed him&s;elf with counting the hour of the day whenever the clock &s;truck; the clock being &s;poiled by &s;ome accident, the idiot continued to &s;trike and count the hour without the help of it, in the &s;ame manner as he had done when it was entire. Though I dare not vouch for the truth of this &s;tory, it is very certain, that cu&s;tom has a mechanical effect upon the body, at the &s;ame time that it has a very extraordinary influence upon the mind.</P>
<P>I &s;hall in this paper con&s;ider one very remarkable effect which cu&s;tom has upon human nature; and which, if rightly ob&s;erved, may lead us into very u&s;eful rules of life. What I &s;hall here take notice of in cu&s;tom, is its wonderful efficacy in making every thing plea&s;ant to us. A per&s;on who is addicted to play or gaming, though he took but little delight in it at fir&s;t, by degrees contracts &s;o &s;trong an inclination towards it, and gives him&s;elf up &s;o entirely to it, that it &s;eems the only end of his being. The love of a retired or bu&s;y life will grow upon a man in&s;en&s;ibly, as he is conver&s;ant in the one or the other, till he is utterly unqualified for reli&s;hing that to which he has
<PB N="60" REF="029518_0031_0FE1CC2B7177B240">
been for &s;ome time di&s;u&s;ed. Nay, a man may &s;moke, or drink, or take &s;nuff, till he is unable to pa&s;s away his time without it, not to mention how our delight in any particular &s;tudy, art, or &s;cience, ri&s;es and improves in proportion to the application which we be&s;tow upon it. Thus, what was at fir&s;t an exerci&s;e, becomes at length an entertainment. Our employments are changed into our diver&s;ions. The mind grows fond of tho&s;e actions &s;he is accu&s;tomed to; and is drawn with reluctancy from tho&s;e paths in which &s;he has been u&s;ed to walk.</P>
<P>Not only &s;uch actions as were at fir&s;t indifferent to us, but even &s;uch as were painful, will, by cu&s;tom and prac|tice, become plea&s;ant. Sir <HI>Francis Bacon</HI> ob&s;erves in his Natural Philo&s;ophy, that our ta&s;te is never plea&s;ed better than with tho&s;e things which at fir&s;t created a di&s;gu&s;t in it. He gives particular in&s;tances of claret, coffee, and other liquors, which the palate &s;eldom approves upon the fir&s;t ta&s;te; but when it has once got a reli&s;h of them, generally retains it for life. The mind is con&s;tituted after the &s;ame manner, and after having habituated her&s;elf to any particular exerci&s;e or employment, not only lo&s;es her fir&s;t aver&s;ion towards it, but conceives a certain fondne&s;s and affection for it. I have heard one of the greate&s;t geniu&s;es this age has produced, who had been trained up in all the polite &s;tudies of antiquity, a&s;&s;ure me, upon his being obliged to &s;earch into &s;everal rolls and records, that notwith&s;tanding &s;uch an employment was at fir&s;t very dry and irk&s;ome to him, he at la&s;t took an incredi|ble plea&s;ure in it, and preferred it even to the reading of <HI>Virgil</HI> or <HI>Cicero.</HI> The reader will ob&s;erve, that I have not here con&s;idered cu&s;tom as it makes things ea&s;y, but as it renders them delightful; and though others have often made the &s;ame reflection, it is po&s;&s;ible they may not have drawn tho&s;e u&s;es from it, with which I intend to fill the remaining part of this paper.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider attentively this property of human na|ture, it may in&s;truct us in very fine morality.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, I would have no man di&s;couraged with that kind of life or &s;eries of action, in which the choice of others, or his own nece&s;&s;ities, may have enga|ged him. It may, perhaps, be very di&s;agreeable to him at fir&s;t; but u&s;e and application will certainly render it not only le&s;s painful, but plea&s;ing and &s;atisfactory.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="029518_0031_0FE1CC2B7177B240">
In the &s;econd place, I would recommend to every one that admirable percept which <HI>Pythagoras</HI> is &s;aid to have given to his di&s;ciples; and which that philo&s;opher mu&s;t have dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">wn from the ob&s;ervation I have enlarged upon: <HI>Optimum vitae genus eligiro; na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> con&s;uetude f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">cier jucundiffi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">rm:</HI> "Pitch upon that cour&s;e of life which is the mo&s;t excellent, and cu&s;tom will render it the mo&s;t delightful." Men, who&s;e circum&s;tances will permit them to chu&s;e their own way of life, are inexcu&s;able if they do not pur|&s;ue that which their judgment tells them is the mo&s;t lau|dable. The voice of rea&s;on is more to be regarded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the bent of any pre&s;ent inclination; &s;ince, by the rules above mentioned, inclination will at length come over to rea&s;on though we can never force rea&s;on to comply with inclination.</P>
<P>In the third place, this ob&s;ervation may teach the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ual and irreligious man to overlook tho&s;e hard&s;hips and difficulties, which are apt to di&s;courage him fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> the pro&s;ecution of a virtuous life. <Q>The gods, &s;aid <HI>He&s;ied,</HI> have placed Labour before Virtue: the way to her is at fir&s;t rough and difficult, but grows more &s;mooth and ea&s;y the farther you advance in it.</Q> The man who proceeds in it with &s;teadine&s;s and re&s;olution, will in a little time find, that <HI>her ways are Ways <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of plea|&s;antne&s;s, and all her paths are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI></P>
<P>To enforce the con&s;ideration, we may further ob&s;erve, that the practice of religion will not only be attended with that plea&s;ure which naturally accompanies tho&s;e actions to which we are habituated, but with tho&s;e &s;uper|numerary joys of heart that ari&s;e from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;uch a plea&s;ure, from the &s;atisfaction of acting up to the dictates of rea&s;on, and from the pro&s;pect of an happy immortality.</P>
<P>In the fourth place, we may learn from this ob&s;erva|tion which we have made on the mind of man, to take particular care when we are once &s;ettled in a regular cour&s;e of life, how we too frequently indulge our&s;elves in any of the mo&s;t innocent diver&s;ions and entertain|ments, &s;ince the mind may in&s;en&s;ibly f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ll off from the reli&s;h of virtuous actions, and, by degrees, exchange that plea&s;ure which it takes in the performance of its duty, for delights of a much more inferior and unprofitable nature.</P>

The la&s;t u&s;e which I &s;hall make of this remarkable property in human nature, of being delighted with tho&s;e actions to which it is accu&s;tomed, is to &s;hew how ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary it is for us to gain habits of virtue in this life, if we would enjoy the plea&s;ures of the next.

Perhaps this raillery is pur&s;ued too for, yet it is turned upon a very obvious remark, that a woman's &s;tronge&s;t pa&s;&s;ion is for her own beauty, and that &s;he values it as her favorite di&s;tinction. From hence it is, that all arts, which pretend to improve or pre&s;erve it, meet with &s;o general a reception among the &s;ex.

<P>That no woman can be <HI>hand&s;ome</HI> by the force of fea|tures alone, any more than &s;he can be <HI>witty</HI> only by the help of &s;peech.</P>
<P>That pride de&s;troys all &s;ymmetry and grace, and affec|tation is a more terrible enemy to fine faces than the &s;mall-pox.</P>
<P>That no woman is capable of being <HI>beautiful</HI> who is not incap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ble of being <HI>fal&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>And, that what would be <HI>odious</HI> in a friend, is <HI>deformity</HI> in a mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>From the&s;e few principles, thus laid down, it will be ea&s;y to prove, that the true art of a&s;&s;i&s;ting beauty, con|&s;i&s;ts

in embelli&s;hing the whole per&s;on, by the proper ornaments of virtuous and commendable qualities. By this help alone it is, that tho&s;e who are the favourite work of nature, or, as Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> expre&s;&s;es it, the por|celain clay of human kind, become animated, and are in a capacity of exerting their charms; and tho&s;e who &s;eem to have been neglected by her, like models wrought in ha&s;te, are capable, in a great mea&s;ure, of fini&s;hing what &s;he has left imperfect.</P>
<P>It is, methinks, a low and degrading idea of that &s;ex, which was created to refine the joys, and &s;often the cares of humanity, by the mo&s;t agreeable participation, to con&s;ider them merely as objects of &s;ight.

<P>When <HI>Adam</HI> is introduced by <HI>Milton,</HI> de&s;cribing <HI>Eve</HI> in Paradi&s;e, and relating to the Angel the Impre&s;&s;ions he felt upon &s;eeing her at her fir&s;t creation, he does not repre&s;ent her like a <HI>Grecian Venus,</HI> by her &s;hape or fea|tures, but by the lu&s;tre of her mind which &s;hone in them, and gave them their power of charming:

<P>A LATE conver&s;ation which I fell into, gave me an opportunity of ob&s;erving a great deal of beauty in a very hand&s;ome woman, and as much wit in an ingenious man, turned into deformity in the one, and ab&s;urdity in the other, by the mere force of affectation. The fair one had &s;omething in her per&s;on upon which her thoughts were fixed, that &s;he attempted to &s;hew to advantage in every lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">k, word, and ge&s;ture. The gentleman was as diligent to do ju&s;tice to his fine parts as the lady to her beauteous form. You might &s;ee his imagination on the &s;tretch to find out &s;omething uncommon, and what they call bright, to entertain her; while &s;he writhed her&s;elf into as many different po&s;tures to engage him. When &s;he laughed, her lips were to &s;ever at a greater di&s;tance than ordinary to &s;hew her teeth: her fan was to point to &s;omething at a di&s;tance, that in the reach &s;he might di&s;|cover the roundne&s;s of her arm; then &s;he is utterly mi&s;taken in what &s;he &s;aw, falls back, &s;miles at her own folly, and is &s;o wholly di&s;compo&s;ed, that her tucker is to be adju&s;ted, her bo&s;om expo&s;ed, and the whole woman put into new airs and graces. While &s;he was doing this, the gallant had time to think of &s;omething very plea&s;ant to &s;ay next to her, or make &s;ome unkind ob&s;ervation on &s;ome other lady to feed her vanity. The&s;e unhappy effects of affec|tation, naturally led me to look into that &s;trange &s;tate of mind which &s;o generally di&s;colours the behaviour of mo&s;t people we meet with.</P>
<P>The learned Dr.<HI>Burnet,</HI> in his theory of the earth, takes occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, that every thought is attended with
<PB N="69" REF="029518_0035_0FE1CC421191B9F8">
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s and repre&s;entativene&s;s. The mind has nothing pre&s;ented to it, but what is immediately followed by a reflection or con&s;cience, which tells you whether that which was &s;o pre&s;ented is graceful or unbecoming. This act of the mind di&s;covers it&s;elf in the ge&s;ture by a proper behaviour in tho&s;e who&s;e con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s goes no further than to direct them in the ju&s;t progre&s;s of their pre&s;ent thought or action; but betrays an interruption in every &s;econd thought, when the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s is employed in too fondly approving a man's own conceptions; which &s;ort of con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s is what we call Affectation.</P>
<P>As the love of prai&s;e is implanted in our bo&s;om as a &s;trong incentive to worthy actions, it is a very difficult ta&s;k to get above a de&s;ire of it for things that &s;hould be wholly indifferent. Women, who&s;e hearts are fixed upon the plea&s;ures they have in the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that they are the objects of love and admiration, are ever changing the air of their countenances, and altering the attitude of their bodies, to &s;trike the hearts of their beholders with new &s;en&s;e of their beauty. The dre&s;&s;ing part of our &s;ex, who&s;e minds are the &s;ame with the &s;illier part of the other, are exactly in the like unea&s;y condition to be regarded for a well tied cravat, a hat cocked with an unu&s;ual bri&s;kne&s;s, a very well cho&s;en coat, or other in&s;tances of merit, which they are impatient to &s;ee unob&s;erved.</P>
<P>But this apparent affectation, ari&s;ing from an ill-govern|ed con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, is not &s;o much to be wondered at, in &s;uch loo&s;e and trivial minds as the&s;e: but when you &s;ee it reign in characters of worth and di&s;tinction, it is what you cannot but lament, nor without &s;ome indignation. It creeps into the heart of the wi&s;e man, as well as that of the coxcomb. When you &s;ee a man of &s;en&s;e look about for applau&s;e, and di&s;cover an it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ing inclination to be commended, lay traps for a little increa&s;e, even from tho&s;e who&s;e opinion he values in nothing but his own favour; who is &s;afe again&s;t this weakne&s;s? Or who knows whether he is guilty of it or not? The be&s;t way to get clear of &s;uch a light fondne&s;s for applau&s;e, is, to take all po&s;&s;ible care to throw off the love of it upon occa&s;ions that are not in them&s;elves laudable; but, as it appears, we hope for no prai&s;e from them. Of this nature are all graces in men's p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ons, dre&s;s, and bodily deportments; which will naturally be winning and attractive if men think not of
<PB N="70" REF="029518_0036_0FE1CC4440071098">
them, but lo&s;e their force in proportion to our endeavours to make them &s;uch.</P>
<P>When our con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s turns upon the main de&s;ign of life, and our thoughts are employed upon the chief pur|po&s;e, either in bu&s;ine&s;s or plea&s;ure, we &s;hall never betray an affectation, for we cannot be guilty of it; but when we give the pa&s;&s;ion for prai&s;e an unbridled liberty, our plea&s;ure, in little perfections, robs us of what is due to us for great virtues and worthy qualities. How many excellent &s;peeches and hone&s;t actions are lo&s;t for want of being indifferent where we ought! Men are oppre&s;&s;ed with regard to their way of &s;peaking and acting, in&s;tead of having their thoughts bent upon what they &s;hould do or &s;ay; and by that means bury a capacity for great things by their fear of failing in indifferent things. This, perhaps, cannot be called Affectation; but it, has &s;ome tincture of it, at lea&s;t, &s;o far, as that their fear of erring in a thing of con&s;equence argues they would be too much plea&s;ed in performing it.</P>
<P>It is only from a thorough di&s;regard to him&s;elf in &s;uch particulars, that man can act with a laudable &s;ufficiency; his heart is fixed upon one point in view; and he com|mits no error, becau&s;e he thinks nothing an error but what deviates from that intention.</P>
<P>The wild havoc affectation makes in that part of the world which &s;hould be mo&s;t polite, is vi&s;ible wherever we turn our eyes: it pu&s;hes men not only into imperti|nence in conver&s;ation, but al&s;o in their premeditated &s;peeches. At the bar it torments the bench, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to cut off all &s;uperfluities in what is &s;poken before it by the practitioner; as well as &s;everal little pieces of inju&s;tice which ari&s;e from the law it&s;elf. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> have &s;een it make a man run from the purpo&s;e before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Judge, who was, when at the bar him&s;elf, &s;o clo&s;e and logical a pleader, that, with all the pomp of eloquence in his power, he never &s;poke a word too much.</P>
<P>It might be borne even here, but it often a&s;cends th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> pulpit it&s;elf; and the declaimer, in that &s;acred place, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> frequently &s;o impertinently witty, &s;peaks of the la&s;t day it&s;elf with &s;o many quaint phra&s;es, that there is no man who under&s;tands raillery, but mu&s;t re&s;olve to &s;in no more: nay, you may behold him &s;ometimes in prayer for a proper delivery of the great truth he is to utter,

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MODESTY is not only an ornament, but al&s;o a guard to virtue. It is a kind of quick and delicate <HI>feel|ing</HI> in the &s;oul, which makes her &s;hrink and withdraw her&s;elf from every thing that has danger in it. It is &s;uch an exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility, as warns her to &s;hun the fir&s;t appearance of every thing that is hurtful.</P>
<P>I cannot at pre&s;ent recollect either the place or time of what I am going to mention; but I have read &s;omewhere in the hi&s;tory of ancient <HI>Greece,</HI> that the women of the
<PB N="72" REF="029518_0037_0FE1CC45DC9AAD78">
country were &s;eized with an unaccountable melancholy, which di&s;po&s;ed &s;everal of them to make away with them|&s;elves. The Senate, after having tried many expedients to prevent this &s;elf-murder, which was &s;o frequent among them, publi&s;hed an edict, that if any women whom&s;oever &s;hould lay violent hands upon her&s;elf, her corp&s;e &s;hould be expo&s;ed naked in the &s;treet, and dragged about the city in the mo&s;t public manner. This edict immediately put a &s;top to the practice which was before &s;o common. We may &s;ee in this in&s;tance the &s;trength of female mode&s;ty, which was able to overcome the vio|lence even of madne&s;s and de&s;pair. The fear of &s;hame, in the fair &s;ex, was, in tho&s;e days, more prevalent than that of death.</P>
<P>If mode&s;ty has &s;o great an influence over our actions, and is in many ca&s;es, &s;o impregnable a fence to virtue, what can more undermine morality than that politene&s;s which reigns among the unthinking part of mankind, and treats as unfa&s;hionable the mo&s;t ingenious part of our behaviour; which recommends impudence as good-breeding, and keeps a man always in countenance, not becau&s;e he is innocent, but becau&s;e he is &s;hamele&s;s?</P>
<P><HI>Seneca</HI> thought mode&s;ty &s;o great a check to vice, that he pre&s;cribed to us the practice of it in &s;ecret, and advi&s;es us to rai&s;e it in our&s;elves upon imaginary occa&s;ions, when &s;uch as are real do not offer them&s;elves: for this is the meaning of his precept, that when we are by our&s;elves, and in our greate&s;t &s;olitudes, we &s;hould fancy that Can &s;tands before us, and &s;ees every thing we do. In &s;hort, if you bani&s;h mode&s;ty out of the world, &s;he carries away with her half the virtues that are in it.</P>
<P>After tho&s;e reflections on mode&s;ty, as it is a virtue, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that there is a vicious mode&s;ty, which ju&s;tly de&s;erves to be ridiculed, and which tho&s;e per&s;ons very often di&s;cover who value them&s;elves mo&s;t upon a well-bre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> confidence. This happens when a man is a&s;hamed to act up to his rea&s;on, and would not, upon any con&s;ideration, be &s;urpri&s;ed in the practice of tho&s;e duties, for the per|formance of which he was &s;ent into the world. Many a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> impudent libertine would blu&s;h to be caught in a &s;erious di&s;cour&s;e, and would &s;carce be able to &s;hew his head, after having di&s;clo&s;ed a religious thought. Decency of beha|viour, all outward &s;hew of virtue, and abhorrence of vice,
<PB N="73" REF="029518_0037_0FE1CC45DC9AAD78">
are carefully avoided by this &s;et of &s;hame faced people, as what would di&s;parage their gaiety of temper, and infalli|bly bring them to di&s;honour. This is &s;uch a poorne&s;s of &s;pirit, &s;uch a de&s;picable cowardice, &s;uch a degenerate, abject &s;tate of mind, as ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> would think human nature incapable of, did we not meet with frequent in&s;tances of it in ordinary conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>There is another kind of vicious mode&s;ty, which makes a man a&s;hamed of his per&s;on, his birth, his profe&s;&s;ion, his poverty, or the like misfortunes, which it was not his choice to prevent, and is not in his power to rectify. If a man appears ridiculous by any of the aforementioned circum&s;tances, he becomes much more &s;o by being out of countenance for them. They &s;hould rather give him occa&s;ion to exert a noble &s;pirit, and to palliate tho&s;e im|perfections which are not in his power, by tho&s;e perfec|tions which are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, to u&s;e a very witty allu&s;ion of an eminent author, he &s;hould imitate <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> who, becau&s;e his head was bald, covered that defect with laurels.</P>

<P>An eminent citizen, who had lived in good fa&s;hion and credit, was, by a train of accidents, and by an una|voidable perplexity in his affairs, reduced to a low con|dition.

His wife, who was a wo|man of &s;en&s;e and virtue, behaved her&s;elf on this occa&s;ion with uncommon decency, and never appeared &s;o amiable
<PB N="74" REF="029518_0038_0FE1CC535AB35B90">
in his eyes as now. In&s;tead of upbraiding him with the ample fortune &s;he had brought, or the many great offers &s;he had refu&s;ed for his &s;ake, &s;he redoubled all the in&s;tan|ces of her affection, while her hu&s;band was continually pouring out his heart to her in complaints that he had ruined the be&s;t woman in the world. He &s;ometimes came home at a time &s;he did not expect him, and &s;urpri|&s;ed her in tears, which &s;he endeavoured to conceal, and always put on an air of cheerfulne&s;s to receive him. To le&s;&s;en their expences, their elde&s;t daughter, (whom I &s;hall call <HI>Amanda</HI>) was &s;ent into the country, to the hou&s;e of an hone&s;t farmer, who had married a &s;ervant of the family. This young woman was apprehen&s;ive of the ruin which was approaching, and had privately engaged a friend in the neighbourhood, to give her an account of what pa&s;&s;ed from time to time of her father's affairs. <HI>Amanda</HI> was in the bloom of her youth and beauty, when the lord of the manor, who often called in at the farmer's hou&s;e as he followed his country &s;ports, fell pa&s;&s;ionately in love with her. He was a man of great genero&s;ity; but from a loo&s;e education, had contracted an hearty aver&s;ion to marriage. He therefore entertained a de&s;ign upon <HI>Amanda's</HI> virtue, which at pre&s;ent he thought fit to keep private. The innocent creature, who never &s;u&s;|pected his intentions, was plea&s;ed with his per&s;on; and having ob&s;erved his growing pa&s;&s;ion for her, hoped, by &s;o advantageous a match, &s;he might quickly be in a ca|pacity of &s;upporting her impoveri&s;hed relations. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> day as he called to &s;ee her, he found her in tears over a letter &s;he had ju&s;t received from her friend, which gave an account that her father had lately been &s;tripped of every thing by an execution. The lover, who with &s;ome difficulty found out the cau&s;e of her grief, took this occa&s;ion to make her a propo&s;al. It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s <HI>Amanda's</HI> confu&s;ion, when &s;he found his preten|&s;ions were not honourable. She was now de&s;erted of all her hopes, and had no power to &s;peak: but ru&s;hing from him in the utmo&s;t di&s;turbance, locked her&s;elf up in a chamber. He immediately di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger to her father with the following letter:</P>

<P>I have been interrupted: I know not how I was moved to &s;ay things would mend. As I was going on, I was &s;tartled by a noi&s;e of one that knocked at the door, and has brought us an unexpected &s;upply of a debt which had long been owing. Oh! I will now tell thee all. It is &s;ome days I have lived almo&s;t without &s;upport, having conveyed what little money I could rai&s;e to your poor father. Thou wilt weep to think where he is; yet be a&s;&s;ured he will be &s;oon at liberty. That cruel letter would have broken his heart; but I have concealed it from him. I have no companion at pre&s;ent be&s;ide little <HI>Fanny,</HI> who &s;tands watching my looks as I write, and is crying for her &s;i&s;ter: &s;he &s;ays &s;he is &s;ure you are not well, having di&s;covered that my pre&s;ent trouble is about you.

grieve thee: no, it is to intreat thee not to make them in&s;upportable, by adding what would be wor&s;e than all.

<P>The me&s;&s;enger, notwith&s;tanding he promi&s;ed to deliv|er this letter to <HI>Amanda,</HI> carried it fir&s;t to his ma&s;ter, who, he imagined, would be glad to have an opportunity of giving it into her hands him&s;elf. His ma&s;ter was im|patient to know the &s;ucce&s;s of his propo&s;al, and there|fore broke open the letter privately to &s;ee the contents. He was not a little moved at &s;o true a picture of virtue in di&s;tre&s;s; but, at the &s;ame time, was infinitely &s;urpri&s;ed to find his offers rejected. However, he re&s;olved not to &s;uppre&s;s the letter, but carefully &s;ealed it up again, and carried it to <HI>Amanda.</HI> All his endeavours to &s;ee her were in vain, till &s;he was a&s;&s;ured he brought a letter from her mother. He would not part with it, but upon condition that &s;he would read it without leaving the room. While &s;he was peru&s;ing it, he fixed his eyes on her face with the deepe&s;t attention: her concern gave a new &s;oftne&s;s to her beauty; and when &s;he bur&s;t into tears, he could no longer refrain from bearing a part in her &s;orrow, and telling her, that he too had read the letter, and was re|&s;olved to make reparation for having been the occa&s;ion of it. My readers will not be di&s;plea&s;ed to &s;ee the &s;econd epi&s;tle, which he now wrote to <HI>Amanda's</HI> mother.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Courteous Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE heard that nothing gives an author &s;o great plea&s;ure as to find his works re&s;pectfully quoted by many learned authors. This plea&s;ure I have &s;eldom enjoyed; for though I have been, if I may &s;ay it without vanity, an eminent author (of Almanacks) annually, now a full quarter of a century, my brother authors in the &s;ame way, for what rea&s;on I know not, have ever been very &s;paring in their applau&s;es, and no other au|thor has taken the lea&s;t notice, of me; &s;o that did not my writings produce me &s;ome &s;olid pudding, the great deficiency of prai&s;e would have quite di&s;couraged me.</P>
<P>I concluded at length, that the people were the be&s;t judges of my merit, for they buy my works; and be&s;ides, in my rambles, where I am not per&s;onally known, I have frequently heard one or other of my adages repeated&punc; with, <HI>as poor Richard &s;ays,</HI> at the end of it; this gave me &s;ome &s;atisfaction, as it &s;hewed not only that my in&s;truc|tions were regarded, but di&s;covered likewi&s;e &s;ome re&s;|pect for my authority; and I own, that to encourage the practice of remembering and repeating tho&s;e wi&s;e &s;enten|ces, I have &s;ometimes quoted my&s;elf with great gravity.</P>
<P>Judge then how much I mu&s;t have been gratified by an accident I am going to relate to you. I &s;topt my hor&s;e lately, where a great number of people were collected at a vendue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> merchant goods. The hour of &s;ale not be|ing come, they were conver&s;ing on the badne&s;s of the
<PB N="78" REF="029518_0040_0FE1CC56E7DFAFF8">
times, and one of the company called to a plain clean old man, with white locks, "Pray, father <HI>Abraham,</HI> what think you of the times? Will not the&s;e heavy taxes quite ruin the country? How &s;hall we be ever able to pay them? What would you advi&s;e us to?" Father <HI>Abraham</HI> &s;tood up, and replied, "If you would have my advice, I will give it you in &s;hort; for a word to the wi&s;e is enough, and many words will not fill a bu&s;hel, <HI>as poor Richard &s;ays."</HI> They joined in de&s;iring him to &s;peak his mind, and ga|thering round him, he proceeded as follows:</P>
<P>"Friends, &s;ays he, and neighbours, the taxes are in|deed very heavy, and if tho&s;e laid on by government were the only ones we had to pay, we might more ea&s;ily di&s;charge them; but we have many others, and much more grievous to &s;ome of us. We are taxed twice as much by our idlene&s;s, three times as much by our pride, and four times as much by our folly; and from the&s;e taxes the commi&s;&s;ioners cannot ea&s;e or deliver us by allowing any abatement. However, let us hearken to good advice, and &s;omething may be done for us. "God helps them that help them&s;elves," <HI>as poor Richard &s;ays,</HI> in his Alman|ack for 1733.</P>
<P>"It would be thought a hard government that &s;hould tax its people one tenth part of their time, to be em|ployed in its &s;ervice: but idlene&s;s taxes many of us much more, if we reckon all that is &s;pent in ab&s;olute <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">loth, or in doing of nothing, with that which is &s;pent in idle employments or amu&s;ements, that amount to nothing. Sloth, by bringing on di&s;ea&s;es ab&s;olutely &s;hortens life. "Sloth, like ru&s;t, con&s;umes fa&s;ter than labour wears, while the u&s;ed key is always bright," <HI>as poor Richard &s;ays.</HI> But do&s;t thou love life, then do not &s;quander time, for this is the &s;tuff life, is made of, <HI>as poor Richard &s;ays.</HI> How much more than is nece&s;&s;ary do we &s;pend in &s;leep! for|getting that, "the &s;leeping fox catches no poultry, and that there will be &s;leeping enough in the grave," <HI>as poor Richard &s;ays.</HI> "If time be of all things the mo&s;t precious, wa&s;ting time mu&s;t be, <HI>as poor Richard &s;ays,</HI> the greate&s;t prodigality; &s;ince, as he el&s;ewhere tells us, "Lo&s;t time is never found again; and what we call time enough, always proves little enough;" let us then up and be do|ing, and doing to the purpo&s;e; &s;o by diligence &s;hall we do more with le&s;s perplexity. "Sloth makes all things

difficult, but indu&s;try ea&s;y, <HI>as poor Richard &s;ays;</HI> and he that ri&s;eth late mu&s;t trot all day, and &s;hall &s;carce over|take his bu&s;ine&s;s at night. While lazine&s;s travels &s;o &s;lowly, that poverty &s;oon overtakes him," <HI>as we read in poor Richard,</HI> who adds, "drive thy bu&s;ine&s;s, let not that drive thee; and early to bed, and early to ri&s;e, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wi&s;e."</P>
<P>So that what &s;ignifies wi&s;hing and hoping for better times? We may make the&s;e times better if we be&s;tir our&s;elves. "Indu&s;try needs not wi&s;h, <HI>as poor Richard &s;ays;</HI> and he that lives upon hope, will die fa&s;ting." There are no gains without pains; "then help hands, for I have no lands," or if I have, they are &s;martly taxed. And, <HI>as poor Richard likewi&s;e ob&s;erves,</HI> "He that hath a trade hath an e&s;tate; and he that hath a calling hath an office of profit and honour; but then the trade mu&s;t be worked at, and the calling well followed, or neither the e&s;tate nor the office will enable us to pay our taxes. If we are indu&s;trious we &s;hall never &s;tarve; for, <HI>as poor Richard &s;ays,</HI> "At the working man's hou&s;e hunger looks in, but dares not enter." Nor will the bailiff or the con|&s;table enter; for, "Indu&s;try pays debts, while De&s;pair increa&s;eth them," <HI>&s;ays poor Richard.</HI> What though you have found no trea&s;ure, nor has any rich relation left you a legacy. "Diligence is the mother of Good luck, <HI>as poor Richard &s;ays,</HI> and God giveth all things to indu&s;try." "Then plough deep while &s;luggards &s;leep, and you &s;hall have corn to &s;ell and to keep," <HI>&s;ays poor Dick.</HI> "Work while it is called to-day, for you know not how much you may be hindered to-morrow;" which makes <HI>poor Richard &s;ay,</HI> "One to-day is worth two to-morrows;"&mdash;and farther, "Have you &s;omewhat to do to-morrow, do it to-day." If you were a &s;ervant, would you not be a&s;ha|med a good ma&s;ter &s;hould catch you idle? Are you then your own ma&s;ter, "and not a&s;hamed to catch your&s;elf idle?" <HI>as poor Dick &s;ays.</HI> When there is &s;o much to be done for your&s;elf, your family, your country, and your gracious king, be up by peep of day: "Let not the &s;un look down and &s;ay, Inglorious here he lies." Handle your tools without mittens; remember, "that the cat in gloves catches no mice," <HI>as poor Dick &s;ays.</HI> 'Tis true, there is much to be done, and perhaps you are weak-handed, but &s;tick to it &s;teadily, and you will &s;ee great
<PB N="80" REF="029518_0041_0FE1CC588895CCB8">
effects; for, "con&s;tant dropping wears away &s;tones, and by diligence and patience the mou&s;e eats into the cable; and little &s;trokes fell great oaks." <HI>as poor Richard &s;ays</HI> in his Almanack, the year I cannot ju&s;t now remember.</P>
<P>Methinks I hear &s;ome of you &s;ay, "Mu&s;t a man afford him&s;elf no lei&s;ure?" I will tell thee, my friend, what <HI>poor Richard &s;ays.</HI> "Employ thy time well, if thou meane&s;t to gain lei&s;ure; and &s;ince thou art not &s;ure of a minute, throw not away an hour." Lei&s;ure is time doing &s;ome|thing u&s;eful; this lei&s;ure the diligent man will obtain, but the lazy man never; &s;o that <HI>as poor Richard &s;ays,"</HI> "A life of lei&s;ure, and a life of lazine&s;s are two things." Do you imagine that &s;loth will afford you more comfort than labour? No, for, <HI>as poor Richard &s;ays,</HI> "Trouble &s;prings from idlene&s;s, and grievous toil from needle&s;s ea&s;e. Many, without labour, would live by their wits only, but they break for want of &s;tock." Whereas in|du&s;try gives comfort, and plenty, and re&s;pect: "Fly plea&s;ures, and they will follow you. The diligent &s;pin|ner has a large &s;hift; and now I have a &s;heep and a cow, every body bids me good-morrow;" all which is well &s;aid by <HI>poor Richard.</HI></P>
<P>But with our indu&s;try, we mu&s;t likewi&s;e be &s;teady, &s;ettled, and careful, and over&s;ee our own affairs with our own eyes, and not tru&s;t too much to others; for, <HI>as poor Richard &s;ays,</HI>
<Q><L><HI>I never &s;aw an oft removed tree,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Nor yet an oft removed family,</HI></L>
<L><HI>That throve &s;o well as tho&s;e that &s;ettled be.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>And again, "three removes are as bad as a fire;" and again, "keep thy &s;hop, and thy &s;hop will keep thee:" and again, "if you would have your bu&s;ine&s;s done, go; if not, &s;end;" and again,
<Q><L><HI>He that by the plough would thrive,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Him&s;elf mu&s;t either hold or drive.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>And again, "the eye of a ma&s;ter will do more work than both his hands;" and again, "want of care does us more damage than want of knowledge;" and again, "not to over&s;ee workmen is to leave them your pur&s;e open." Tru&s;ting too much to others care is the ruin of many; for, as the Almanack &s;ays, "In the affairs of this world, men are &s;aved, not by faith, but by the want
<PB N="81" REF="029518_0041_0FE1CC588895CCB8">
of it; but a man's own care is profitable; for, <HI>&s;aith poor Dick,</HI> "Learning is to the &s;tudious, and riches to the careful, as well as power to the bold, and heaven to the virtuous." And further, "If you would have a faithful &s;ervant, and one that you like, &s;erve your&s;elf." And again, he advi&s;eth to circum&s;pection and care, even in the &s;malle&s;t matters, becau&s;e &s;ometimes, "A little neg|lect may breed great mi&s;chief; adding, for want of a nail the &s;hoe was lo&s;t; and for want of a &s;hoe the hor&s;e was lo&s;t; for want of a hor&s;e the rider was lo&s;t; being overtaken and &s;lain by the enemy; all for want of care about a hor&s;e &s;hoe nail."</P>
<P>So much for indu&s;try, my friends, and attention to one's own bu&s;ine&s;s; but to the&s;e we mu&s;t add frugality, if we would make our indu&s;try more certainly &s;ucce&s;sful. A man may, if he knows not how to &s;ave as he gets, keep his no&s;e all his life at the grind&s;tone, and die not worth a groat at the la&s;t. "A fat kitchen makes a lean will," <HI>as poor Richard &s;ays;</HI> and,
<Q><L><HI>Many e&s;tates are &s;pent in the getting,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Since women for tea for&s;ook &s;pinning and knitting,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And men for punch for&s;ook hewing and &s;plitting.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>"If you would be wealthy, &s;ays he in another Alman|ach, think of &s;aving as well as getting: the <HI>Indies</HI> have not made <HI>Spain</HI> rich, becau&s;e her outgoes are greater than her incomes." Away then with your expen&s;ive follies, and you will not have &s;o much cau&s;e to complain of hard times, heavy taxes and chargeable families: for, <HI>as poor Dick &s;ays,</HI>
<Q><L><HI>Women and wine, game and deceit,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Make the wealth &s;mall, and the wants great.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>And farther, "What maintains one vice, would bring up two children." You may think, perhaps, that a little tea, or a little punch now and then, diet a little more co&s;tly, clothes a little finer, and a little entertainment now and then, can be no great matter; but remember what <HI>poor Richard &s;ays,</HI> "Many a little makes a mickle;" and farther, "Beware of little expences; a &s;mall leak will &s;ink a great &s;hip;" and again, "Who dainties love, &s;hall beggars prove;" and moreover, "Fools make fea&s;ts, and wi&s;e men eat them."</P>
<P>Here you are all got together, at this vendue of fineries
<PB N="82" REF="029518_0042_0FE1CC6647B4B3B8">
and knicknacks. You call them goods, but if you do not take care, they will prove evils to &s;ome of you. You expect that they will be &s;old cheap, and perhaps they may for le&s;s than they co&s;t, but if you have no occa&s;ion for them, they mu&s;t be dear to you. Remember what <HI>poor Richard &s;ays,</HI> "Buy what thou ha&s;t no need of, and ere long thou &s;halt &s;ell thy nece&s;&s;aries." And again, "At a great pennyworth pau&s;e a while:" he means, that perhaps the cheapne&s;s is apparently only, and not real; or the bargain, by &s;traitening thee in thy bu&s;i|ne&s;s, may do thee more harm than good. For in ano|ther place he &s;ays, "many have been ruined by buying good pennyworths." Again, <HI>poor Richard &s;ays,</HI> "'Tis fooli&s;h to lay out money in a purcha&s;e of repentance;" and yet this folly is practi&s;ed every day at vendues, for want of minding the Almanack. "Wi&s;e men, <HI>as poor Dick &s;ays,</HI> learn by others harms, fools &s;carcely by their own; but <HI>felix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum."</HI> Many a one, for the &s;ake of finery on the back, have go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> with a hungry belly, and half-&s;tarved their families: "Silks and &s;attins, &s;carlets and velvets, <HI>as poor Richard &s;ays,</HI> put out the kitchen fire." The&s;e are not the nece&s;|&s;aries of life; they can &s;carcely be called the convenien|cies, and yet only becau&s;e they look pretty, how many want to have them! The artificial wants of mankind thus become more numerous than the natural; and, <HI>as poor Dick &s;ays,</HI> "For one poor per&s;on, there are an hundred indigent." By the&s;e and other extravagancies, the gen|teel are reduced to poverty, and forced to borrow of tho&s;e whom they formerly de&s;pi&s;ed, but who through indu&s;try and frugality have maintained their &s;tanding: in which ca&s;e it appears plainly, that "a ploughman on his legs is higher than a gentleman on his knees,"<HI>as poor Rich|ard &s;ays.</HI> Perhaps they have had a &s;mall e&s;tate left them, which they knew not the getting of; they think, "It is day, and will never be night; that a little to be &s;pent out of &s;o much is not worth minding:" a child and a fool, <HI>as poor Richard &s;ays,</HI> imagine twenty &s;hillings and twenty years can never be &s;pent; but, always taking out of the meal tub, and never putting in, &s;oon comes to the bottom; then, <HI>as poor Dick &s;ays,</HI> "When the well is dry, they know the worth of water." But this they might have known before, if they had taken his advice: "If you would know
<PB N="83" REF="029518_0042_0FE1CC6647B4B3B8">
the value of money, go and try to borrow &s;ome; for he that goes a-borrowing goes a-&s;orrowing; and indeed &s;o he does that lends to &s;uch people, when he goes to get it again." <HI>Poor Dick,</HI> farther advi&s;es, and &s;ays,
<Q><L><HI>Fond pride in dre&s;s is &s;ure a very cur&s;e;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Ere fancy you con&s;ult&mdash;con&s;ult your pur&s;e.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>And again, "Pride is as loud a beggar as Want, and a great deal more &s;aucy." When you have bought one fine thing, you mu&s;t buy ten more, that your appearance may he all of a piece; but <HI>poor Dick &s;ays,</HI> "It is ea&s;ier to &s;uppre&s;s the fir&s;t de&s;ire, than to &s;atisfy all that follow it. And that it is as truly folly for the poor to ape the rich, as the frog to &s;well, in order to equal the ox."</P>
<LG>
<L><HI>Great e&s;tates may venture more,</HI></L>
<L><HI>But little boats &s;hould keep near &s;hore.</HI></L>
</LG>
<P>"It is however a folly &s;oon puni&s;hed; for pride that dines on vanity, &s;ups on content," <HI>as poor Richard &s;ays.</HI> And, in another place, "Pride breakfa&s;ted with plenty, dined with poverty, and &s;upped with infamy." And, after all, for what u&s;e is the pride of appearance, for which &s;o much is ri&s;ked, &s;o much is &s;uffered? It cannot promote health, or ea&s;e pain; it makes no increa&s;e of merit in the per&s;on, it creates envy, it ha&s;tens misfortune.</P>
<LG>
<L><HI>" What is a butterfly? At be&s;t</HI></L>

</LG>
<P>But what madne&s;s mu&s;t it be to run in debt for the&s;e &s;uperfluities! we are offered, by the terms of this vendue, &s;ix months credit; and that perhaps has induced &s;ome of us to attend it, becau&s;e we cannot &s;pare the ready money, and hope now to be fine without it. But, ah! think what you do when you run in debt; you give to another power over your liberty. If you cannot pay at the time, you will be a&s;hamed to &s;ee your creditor; you will be in fear when you &s;peak to him; you will make poor, pitiful, &s;neaking excu&s;es, and by degrees come to lo&s;e your verac|ity, and &s;ink into ba&s;e downright lying; for, <HI>as poor Richard &s;ays,</HI> "the &s;econd vice is lying, the fir&s;t is running into debt." And again, to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, "lying rides upon debt's back." Whereas a freeborn <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> ought not to be a&s;hamed or afraid to &s;ee or &s;peak to any
<PB N="84" REF="029518_0043_0FE1CC681A9FFE88">
man living. But poverty often deprives a man of all &s;pirit and virtue; "It is hard for an empty bag to &s;tand up|right," <HI>as poor Richard truly &s;ays.</HI> What would you think of that prince, or that government, who would i&s;&s;ue an edict forbidding you to dre&s;s like a gentleman, or gentle|woman, on pain of impri&s;onment or &s;ervitude? Would you not &s;ay, that you are free, have a right to dre&s;s as you plea&s;e, and that &s;uch an edict would be a breach of your privileges, and &s;uch a government tyrannical? And yet you are about to put your&s;elves under that tyranny, when you run in debt for &s;uch dre&s;s! your creditor has authority at his plea&s;ure to deprive you of your liberty, by confining you in a jail for life, or by &s;elling you for a &s;er|vant, if you &s;hould not be able to pay him. When you have got your bargain, you may, perhaps, think little of payment; but "Creditors," <HI>as poor Dick tells us,</HI> "have better memories than debtors;" and, in another place, &s;ays, "Creditors are a &s;uper&s;titious &s;ect, great ob&s;ervers of &s;et days and times." The day comes round before you are aware, and the demand is made before you are pre|pared to &s;atisfy it. Or, if you bear your debt in mind, the term which at fir&s;t &s;eemed &s;o long, will, as it le&s;&s;ens, appear extremely &s;hort.

<P>I HAD occa&s;ion to go a few miles out of town, &s;ome days &s;ince, in a &s;tage-coach, where I had for my fel|low-travellers, a dirty bean, and a pretty young Quaker woman. Having no inclination to tal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> much at that time, I placed my&s;elf backward with a de&s;ign to &s;urvey them, and to pick a &s;peculation out of my two compan|ions. Their different figures were &s;ufficient of them|&s;elves to draw my attention. The gentleman was dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;uit, the ground whereof had been black, as I per|ceived from &s;ome few &s;paces that had e&s;caped the pow|der, which was incorporated with the greate&s;t part of his coat: his perriwig, which co&s;t no &s;mall &s;um, was after &s;o &s;lovenly a manner ca&s;t over his &s;houlders, that it &s;eem|ed not to have been combed &s;ince the year 1712; his linen, which was not much concealed, was daubed with plain <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> from the chin to the lowe&s;t button; and the diamond upon his finger (which naturally dreaded the water) put me in mind how it &s;parkled amid&s;t the rubbi&s;h of the mine, where it was fir&s;t di&s;covered. On the other hand, the pretty Quaker appeared in all the elegance of cleanline&s;s. Not a &s;peck was to be found upon her. A clear, clean, oval face, ju&s;t edged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with little thin plaits of the pure&s;t can bric, received great advantages from the &s;hade of her black hood; as did the whitene&s;s of her arms from that &s;ober-coloured &s;tuff, in which &s;he had clothed her&s;elf. The plainne&s;s of her dre&s;s was very well &s;uited to the &s;implicity of her phra&s;es; all which put together, though they could not give me a great opinion of her religion, they did of her innocence.</P>
<P>This adventure occa&s;ioned my throwing together a few hints upon cleanline&s;s, which I &s;hall con&s;ider as one of the <HI>half-virtues,</HI> as <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> calls them, and &s;hall rec|ommend it under the three following heads: as it is a mark of politene&s;s; as it produces love; and as it bears analogy to purity of mind.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It is a mark of politene&s;s. It is univer&s;ally agreed upon, that no one unadorned with this virtue can go into company without giving a manife&s;t offence. The ea&s;ier or higher any one's fortune is, this duty ri&s;e,
<PB N="87" REF="029518_0044_0FE1CC69B9B1FD30">
proportionally. The different nations of the world are as much di&s;tingui&s;hed by their Cleanline&s;s, as by their arts and &s;ciences. The more any country is civilized, the more they con&s;ult this part of politene&s;s. We need but compare our ideas of a female <HI>Hottentot</HI> and an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> beauty, to be &s;atisfied of the truth of what has been advanced.</P>
<P>In the next place, cleanline&s;s may be &s;aid to be the fo&s;ter-mother of love. Beauty indeed mo&s;t commonly produces that pa&s;&s;ion in the mind, but cleanline&s;s pre|&s;erves it. An indifferent face and per&s;on, kept in per|petual neatne&s;s, hath won many a heart from a pretty flattern. Age it&s;elf is not unamiable, while it is pre|&s;erved clean and un&s;ullied: like a piece of metal con|&s;tantly kept &s;mooth and bright, we look on it with more plea&s;ure than on a new ve&s;&s;el that is cankered with ru&s;t.</P>
<P>I might ob&s;erve farther, that as cleanline&s;s renders us agreeable to others, &s;o it makes us ea&s;y to our&s;elves; that it is an excellent pre&s;ervative of health; and that &s;everal vices de&s;tructive both to mind and body, are in|con&s;i&s;tent with the habit of it. But the&s;e reflections I &s;hall leave to the lei&s;ure of my readers, and &s;hall ob&s;erve in the third place, that it bears a great analogy to purity of mind, and naturally in&s;pires refined &s;entiments and pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>We find from experience, that through the prevalence of cu&s;tom, the mo&s;t vicious actions lo&s;e their horror, by being made familiar to us. On the contrary, tho&s;e who live in the neighbourhood of good examples, fly from the fir&s;t appearance of what is &s;hocking. It fares with us much after the &s;ame manner, as to our ideas. Our &s;en&s;es which are the inlets of all the images conveyed to the mind, can only tran&s;mit the impre&s;&s;ions of &s;uch things as u&s;ually &s;urround them. So that pure and un&s;ullied thoughts are naturally &s;ugge&s;ted to the mind, by tho&s;e objects that perpetually encompa&s;s us, when they are beautiful and elegant in their kind.</P>
<P>In the Ea&s;t, where the warmth of the climate makes cleanline&s;s more immediately nece&s;&s;ary than in colder countries, it is made one part of their religion: the <HI>Jew|i&s;h</HI> law, (and the <HI>Mahometan,</HI> which in &s;ome things copies after it) is filled with bathings, purifications, and other rites of the like nature. Though there is the above-named convenient rea&s;on to be a&s;&s;igned for their cere|monies,
<PB N="88" REF="029518_0045_0FE1CC6B5D410380">
the chief intention undoubtedly was to typify inward purity and cleanline&s;s of heart by tho&s;e outward wa&s;hings. We read &s;everal injunctions of this kind in the book of <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> which confirm this truth; and which are but ill accounted for by &s;aying, as &s;ome do, that they were only in&s;tituted for convenience, in the de&s;art, which otherwi&s;e could not have been habitable for many years.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this e&s;&s;ay, with a &s;tory which I have &s;omewhere read in an account of <HI>Mahometan</HI> &s;uper&s;titions.</P>
<P>A <HI>Dervi&s;e</HI> of great &s;anctity, one morning had the mis|fortune, as he took up a cry&s;tal cup which was con&s;e|crated to the prophet, to let it fall upon the ground, and da&s;h it to pieces. His &s;on coming in, &s;ome time after, he &s;tretched out his hand to ble&s;s him, as his manner was every morning; but the youth going out, &s;tumbled over the thre&s;hold, and broke his arm. As the old man wondered at the&s;e events, a caravan pa&s;&s;ed by in its way from <HI>Mecca.</HI> The <HI>Dervi&s;e</HI> approached it to beg a ble&s;|&s;ing; but as he &s;troked one of the holy camels, he re|ceived a kick from the bea&s;t that &s;orely brui&s;ed him. His &s;orrow and amazement increa&s;ed upon him, till he recollected, that through hurry and inadvertency, he had that morning come abroad without wa&s;hing his hands.</P>

<P>TO be courteous to all, but familiar to few, is a max|im which I once de&s;pi&s;ed, as originally proceeding from a mean and contracted mind, the frigid caution of weakne&s;s and timidity. A tame and indi&s;criminate civ|ility I imputed to a dread of the contempt or petulency of others, to fears from which the wit and the gentleman are exempted by a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their own dignity, by their power to depre&s;s in&s;olence, and &s;ilence ridicule and a general &s;hyne&s;s and re&s;erve, I con&s;idered as the reproach of our country, as the effect of an illiberal edu|cation, by which neither a polite addre&s;s, an ea&s;y confi|dence, nor a general acquaintance with public life are to be acquired. This opinion, which continued to flat|ter the levity and pride that produced it, was &s;trength|ened
<PB N="89" REF="029518_0045_0FE1CC6B5D410380">
by the example of tho&s;e who&s;e manner in the diffi|dence of youth I wi&s;hed to imitate, who entered a mixed, company with an air of &s;erene familiarity, acco&s;ted every man like an old acquaintance, and thought only of ma|king &s;port of any of the re&s;t with whom their caprice &s;hould happen to be offended, without regard to their age, character or condition.</P>
<P>But now I wi&s;h that I had regulated my conduct by the maxims which I de&s;pi&s;ed, for I &s;hould then have e&s;caped a misfortune which I &s;hall never retrieve; and the &s;en&s;e of, which I am now endeavouring to &s;u&s;pend, by relating it to you as a le&s;&s;on to others, and con&s;idering my lo&s;s of happine&s;s as an acqui&s;ition of wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>While I was in <HI>France</HI> with a travelling tutor, I receiv|ed a letter which acquainted me that my father, who had been long declining, was dead; and that it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary I &s;hould immediately return to <HI>England,</HI> to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his e&s;tate, which was not incon&s;iderable, though there were mortgages upon it to near half its value.</P>
<P>When I arrived, I found a letter which the old gen|tleman had written and directed to me with his own hand. It contained &s;ome general rules for my conduct, and &s;ome animadver&s;ions upon his own: he took notice of the incumbrances under which he left me the pater|nal inheritance, which had de&s;cended through many generations; and expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t earne&s;t de&s;ire that it might yet be tran&s;mitted entire to po&s;terity. With this view, he &s;aid, he had negociated a marriage between me and the only daughter of his old friend Sir <HI>George Home&s;tead,</HI> of the North; an amiable young lady, who&s;e alliance would be an honour to my family, and who&s;e fortune would much more than redeem my e&s;tate.</P>
<P>He had given the Knight a faithful account of his affairs, who, after having taken &s;ome time to con&s;ider the propo&s;als, and con&s;ult his friends, had con&s;ented to the match, upon condition that his daughter and I &s;hould be agreeable to each other, and that my behaviour &s;hould confirm the character that had been given of me. My father added, that he hoped to have lived till this alliance had taken place; but as Providence had other|wi&s;e determined, he intreated, as his la&s;t reque&s;t, that as &s;oon as my affairs &s;hould be &s;ettled, and decency would permit, I would make Sir <HI>George</HI> a vi&s;it, and neglect noth|ing to accompli&s;h this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="029518_0046_0FE1CC7C43D794E0">
I was touched with the zeal and tenderne&s;s of pater|nal affection, which was then directing me to happine&s;s, after the heart <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hat felt it had cea&s;ed to beat, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that expre&s;&s;ed it was mouldering in the du&s;t. I had al&s;o &s;een the lady not indeed &s;ince we were chil|dren; but I remembered that her per&s;on was agreeable, and her temper &s;weet: I did not, therefore, he&s;itate a moment, whether my father's injunctions &s;hould be obey|ed. I proceded to fettle his affairs; I took an account of debts and credits, vi&s;ited the tenants, recovered my u&s;ual gaiety, and at the end of about nine months &s;et out for Six <HI>George's</HI> feat in the North; having before opened an epi&s;tolary corre&s;pondence, and expre&s;&s;ed my impatience to po&s;&s;e&s;s the happine&s;s which my father had &s;o kindly &s;ecured.</P>
<P>I was better plea&s;ed to be well mounted, than to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oll in a chariot, or be jumbled in a po&s;t chai&s;e: and I knew that Sir <HI>George</HI> was an old &s;port&s;man, a plain hearty blade, who would like me better in a pair of buck&s;kin breeches on the back of a good hunter, than in a trimmed &s;uit, and gaudy equipage: I therefore &s;et out on hor&s;eback with only one &s;ervant, and reached <HI>Stilton</HI> the fir&s;t night.</P>
<P>In the morning, as I was mounting, a gentleman, who had ju&s;t got on hor&s;eback before me, ordered his &s;ervant to make &s;ome inquiry about the road, which I happened to overhear, and told him with great familiarity, that I was going the &s;ame way, and if he plea&s;ed we would tra|vel together: to this he con&s;ented, with as much frank|ne&s;s, and as little ceremony; and I &s;et forward, greatly delighted that chance had afforded me a companion.</P>
<P>We Immediately entered into conver&s;ation, and I &s;oon found that he had been abroad: we extolled the roads and the polity of <HI>France,</HI> the cities, the palaces, and the villas; entered into a critical examination of the mo&s;t celebrated &s;eats in <HI>England,</HI> the peculiarity of the build|ings and &s;ituation, cro&s;s ways, market towns, the impo|&s;ition of innkeepers, and the &s;ports of the field: topics, by which we mutually recommended our&s;elves to each other, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> we had both opportunities to di&s;cover equal knowledge, and to di&s;play truth with &s;uch evidence as prevented diver&s;ity of opinion.</P>
<P>After we had rode about two hours, we overtook ano|ther gentleman whom we acco&s;ted with the &s;ame famil|iarity
<PB N="91" REF="029518_0046_0FE1CC7C43D794E0">
that we had u&s;ed to each other: we a&s;ked him how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he was going, and which way; at what rate he trav|elled, where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e put up, and many other que&s;tions of the &s;ame kind. The gentleman, who appeared to be near fifty, received our addre&s;s with great coldne&s;s, re|turned &s;hort and indirect an&s;wers to our inquiries, and often looking with great attention on us both, &s;ometimes put forward that he might get before us, and &s;ometimes checked his hor&s;e that he might remain behind. But we were re&s;olved to di&s;appoint him; and finding that his re&s;erve increa&s;ed, and that he was vi&s;ibly di&s;plea&s;ed, we winked at each other, and determined the old Put &s;hould afford us &s;ome &s;port. After we had rode together upon very ill terms more than half an hour, my compan|ion, with an air of ceremonious gravity, a&s;ked him if he knew of any hou&s;e upon the road where he might be ac|commodated with a wench. The gentleman, who was I believe afraid of giving us a pretence to quarrel, did not re&s;ent this in&s;ult any otherwi&s;e than by making no reply. I then began to talk to my companion as if we had been old acquaintances, reminding him, that the gentleman extremely re&s;embled a per&s;on from whom we had taken a girl that he was carrying to the bagnio, and indeed, that his pre&s;ent re&s;erve made me &s;u&s;pect him to be &s;ame; but that as we were willing to a&s;k his pardon, we hoped it would be forgotten, and that we &s;hould &s;till have the plea&s;ure of dining together at the next inn. The gen|tleman was &s;till &s;ilent; but as his perplexity and re&s;ent|ment vi&s;ibly increa&s;ed, he proportionably increa&s;ed our entertainment, which did not, however, la&s;t long, for he &s;uddenly turned down a lane; upon which we &s;et up a hor&s;e-laugh, that continued till he was out of hearing, and then pur&s;uing our journey, we talked of the adven|ture, which afforded us conver&s;ation and merriment for the re&s;t of the day.</P>
<P>The next morning we parted, and in the evening I arrived at <HI>Home&s;tead-Hall.</HI> The old Knight received me with great affection, and immediately introduced me to his daughter, whom I now thought the fine&s;t woman I had ever &s;een. I could ea&s;ily di&s;cover that I was not unwelcome to her, merely upon her father's recommen|dation, and I enjoyed by anticipation the felicity which I con&s;idered as within my gra&s;p. But the plea&s;ing &s;cene, in which I had &s;uffered my imagination to wander, &s;ud|denly
<PB N="92" REF="029518_0047_0FE1CC7A9C602518">
di&s;appeared as by the power of inchantment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> without any vi&s;ible motive, the behaviour of the whole family was changed; my a&s;&s;iduities to the lady were repre&s;&s;ed; &s;he was never to be found alone; the Knight treated me with a cold civility: I was no longer a party in their vi&s;its, nor was willingly attended even by the &s;ervants. I made many attempts to di&s;cover the cau&s;e of this misfortune, but without &s;ucce&s;s; and one morning, when I had drawn Sir <HI>George</HI> into the garden by him&s;elf, and was about to urge him upon the &s;ubject, he prevented me, by &s;aying, that his promi&s;e to my father, for whom he had the highe&s;t regard, as I well knew, was condition|al; that he had always re&s;olved to leave his daughter a free choice; and that &s;he had reque&s;ted him to acquaint me, that her affections were otherwi&s;e engaged, and to intreat that I would therefore di&s;continue my addre&s;&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. My &s;urpri&s;e and concern at this declaration, were &s;uch as left me no power to reply; and I &s;aw Sir <HI>George</HI> turn from me, and go into the hou&s;e, without making any attempt to &s;top him, or to obtain a farther explanation. Afterwards indeed, I frequently expo&s;tulated, intreated, and complained; but, perceiving that all was ineffectual, I took my leave, and determined that I would &s;till &s;olicit by letter; for the lady had taken &s;uch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my heart, that I would joyfully have married her, though I had been &s;ure that her father would immediately have left all his fortune to a &s;tranger.</P>
<P>I meditated on my epi&s;tolary project all the way to <HI>London;</HI> and before I had been three days in town, I wrote a long letter to Sir <HI>George,</HI> in which I conjured him, In the &s;tronge&s;t terms, to account for the change in his be|haviour; and in&s;i&s;ted, that, on this occa&s;ion, to conceal the truth, was in the highe&s;t degree di&s;honourable to him&s;elf, and injurious to me.</P>

<P>I courted the &s;ociety of a &s;tranger, and a &s;tranger I per&s;ecuted with in&s;ult: thus I a&s;&s;ociated with infamy, and thus my a&s;&s;ociate became known.

<P>CHREMYLUS, who was an old and a good man, and withal exceeding poor, being de&s;irous to leave &s;ome riches to his &s;on, con&s;ults the oracle of <HI>Apollo</HI> upon the &s;ubject. The oracle bid him follow the fir&s;t man he &s;hould &s;ee upon his going out of the temple. The per&s;on he chanced to &s;ee was to appearance an old, &s;ordid, blind man; but upon his following him from place to place, he at la&s;t found, by his own confe&s;&s;ion, that he was <HI>Plutus</HI> the god of riches, and that he was ju&s;t come out of the hou&s;e of a mi&s;er. <HI>Plutus</HI> further told him, that when he was a boy he u&s;ed to declare, that as &s;oon as he came to age, he would di&s;tribute wealth to none but virtuous and ju&s;t men; upon which <HI>Jupiter,</HI> con&s;idering the pernicious con&s;equences of &s;uch a re&s;olution, took his &s;ight away from him, and left him to &s;troll about the world in the blind condition wherein <HI>Chremylus</HI> beheld him. With much ado <HI>Chremylus</HI> prevailed upon him to go to his hou&s;e, where he met an old woman in a tattered raiment, who had been his gue&s;t for many years, and who&s;e name was <HI>Poverty.</HI> The old woman refu&s;ing to turn out &s;o readily as he would have her, he threatened to bani&s;h her, not only from his own hou&s;e, but cut of <HI>Greece,</HI> if &s;he made any more words upon the matter. <HI>Poverty</HI> on this occa|&s;ion pleads her cau&s;e very notably, and repre&s;ents to her old landlord, that &s;hould &s;he be driven out of the country, all their trades, arts, and &s;ciences, would be driven out with her; and that if every one was rich, they would never be &s;upplied with tho&s;e pomps, ornaments, and convenien|cies of life, which made riches de&s;irable. She likewi&s;e repre&s;ented the &s;everal advantages which &s;he be&s;towed upon her votaries, in regard to their &s;hape, their health, and their activity, by pre&s;erving them from gouts, drop&s;ies,

unwieldine&s;s, and intemperance. But whatever &s;he had to &s;ay for her&s;elf, &s;he was at la&s;t forced to move off. <HI>Chremy|lus</HI> immediately con&s;idered how he might re&s;tore <HI>Plutus</HI> to his &s;ight; and in order to do it, conveyed him to the temple of <HI>E&s;oulapius,</HI> who was famous for cures and mira|cles of this nature. By this means the deity recovered his eyes, and began to make a right u&s;e of them, by enrich|ing every one that was di&s;tingui&s;hed by piety towards the gods, and ju&s;tice towards men; and at the &s;ame time by taking away his gifts from the impious and unde&s;erving. This produced &s;everal merry incidents 'till in the la&s;t act <HI>Mercury</HI> de&s;cends with great complaints from the gods, that &s;ince the good men were grown rich they had received no &s;acrifices, which is confirmed by a prie&s;t of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> who enters with a remon&s;trance, that &s;ince the&s;e late innovations he was reduced to a &s;tarving condition, and could not live upon his office. <HI>Chremylus,</HI> who in the beginning of the play was religious in his poverty, concludes with a propo&s;al which was reli&s;hed by all the good men, who were now grown rich as well as him&s;elf, (i. e.) that they &s;hould carry <HI>Plutus</HI> in &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion to the temple, and in&s;tall him in the place of <HI>Jupiter.</HI> This allegory in&s;tructed the <HI>Athenians</HI> in two points; fir&s;t, as it vindica|ted the conduct of Providence in its ordinary di&s;tribution of wealth; and, in the next place, as it &s;hewed the great tendency of riches to corrupt the morals of tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them.</P>

<P>A YOUNG gentleman and lady of ancient and honor|able hou&s;es in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> had from their childhood entertained for each other a generous and noble pa&s;&s;ion, which had long been oppo&s;ed by their friends, by rea&s;on of the inequality of their fortunes; but their con&s;tancy to each other, and obedience to tho&s;e on whom they depended, wrought &s;o much upon their relations, that tho&s;e celebrated lovers were at length joined in marriage. Soon after the nuptials, the bridegroom was obliged to go into a foreign country to take care of a con&s;iderable

fortune which was left him by a relation, and came very opportunely to improve their moderate circum&s;tances. They received the congratulations of all the country upon this occa&s;ion; and I remember it was a common &s;entence in every one's mouth, <HI>You &s;ee how faithful love is rewarded.</HI></P>
<P>He took his agreeable voyage, and &s;ent home every po&s;t fre&s;h accounts of his &s;ucce&s;s in his affairs abroad; but at la&s;t (though he de&s;igned to return with the next &s;hip) he lamented in his letters, that bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould detain him &s;ome time longer from home, becau&s;e he would give him|&s;elf the plea&s;ure of an unexpected arrival.</P>
<P>The young lady, after the heat of the day, walked every evening on the &s;ea-&s;hore, near which &s;he lived, with a familiar friend, her hu&s;band's kin&s;woman, and diverted her&s;elf with what objects they met with there, or upon di&s;cour&s;e of the future methods of life in the happy change of their circum&s;tances. They &s;tood one evening on the &s;hore together in a perfect tranquillity, ob&s;erving the &s;etting of the &s;un, the calm face of the deep, and the &s;ilent heaving of the waves, which gently rolled to|wards them, and broke at their feet; when, at a di&s;tance, her kin&s;woman &s;aw &s;omething floating on the water, which &s;he fancied was a che&s;t; and, with a &s;mile, told her, &s;he &s;aw it fir&s;t, and if it came a&s;hore full of jewels, &s;he had a right to it. They both fixed their eyes upon it, and entertained them&s;elves with the &s;ubject of the wreck, the cou&s;in &s;till a&s;&s;erting her right; but promi&s;ing, if it was a prize, to give her a very rich coral for her child, of which &s;he was then big, provided &s;he might be godmother. Their mirth &s;oon abated when they ob&s;er|ved, upon the nearer approach, that it was a human bo|dy. The young lady, who had a heart naturally filled with pity and compa&s;&s;ion, made many melancholy reflec|tions on the occa&s;ion. Who knows, (&s;aid &s;he) but this man may be the only hope and heir of a wealthy hou&s;e, the darling of indulgent parents, who are now in imper|tinent mirth, and plea&s;ing them&s;elves with the thoughts of offering him a bride they have got ready for him? Or, may he not be the ma&s;ter of a family that wholly depended on his life? There may, for aught we know, be half a dozen fatherle&s;s children, and a tender wife, now expo&s;ed to poverty by his death.

She turned away, when a wave threw the carca&s;e on &s;hore. The kin&s;woman immedi|ately &s;hrieked out. Oh, my cou&s;in! and fell upon the ground. The unhappy wife went to help her friend, when &s;he &s;aw her own hu&s;band at her feet, and dropt in|to a &s;woon upon the body. An old woman, who had been the gentleman's nur&s;e, came about this time to call the ladies into &s;upper, and found her child (as &s;he always called him) dead on the &s;hore, her mi&s;tre&s;s and kin&s;wo|man both lying dead by him. Her loud lamentations, and calling her young ma&s;ter to life, &s;oon awaked the friend from her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rance; but the wife was gone for ever.</P>
<P>When the family and neighbourhood got together round the bodies, no one a&s;ked any que&s;tions, but the objects before them told the &s;tory.</P>
<P>Incidents of this nature are the more moving, when they are drawn by per&s;ons concerned in the cata&s;trophe, notwith&s;tanding they are often oppre&s;&s;ed beyond the power of giving them in a di&s;tinct light, except we ga|ther their &s;orrow from their inability to &s;peak it.</P>
<P>I have two original letters, written both on the &s;ame day, which &s;eem to be exqui&s;ite in their kinds. The oc|ca&s;ion was this: a gentleman who had courted a mo&s;t agreeable young woman, and won her heart, obtained al&s;o the con&s;ent of her father, to whom &s;he was an only child. The old man had a fancy that they &s;hould be married in the &s;ame church where he him&s;elf was, in a village in <HI>We&s;tmoreland,</HI> and made them &s;et out, while he was laid up with the goat at <HI>London.</HI> The bridegroom took only his man, and the bride her maid: they had the mo&s;t agreeable journey imaginable to the place of marriage; from whence the bridegroom wrote the fol|lowing letter to his wife's father:</P>

<P>The villagers were a&s;&s;embled about the church, and the happy couple took a walk in a private garden. The bridegroom's man knew his ma&s;ter would leave the place on a &s;udden after the wedding, and &s;eeing him draw his pi&s;tols the night before, took this opportunity to go in|to the chamber and charge them. Upon their return from the garden, they went into the room; and after a little fond raillery on the &s;ubject of their court&s;hip, the lover took up a pi&s;tol, which he knew he had unloaded the night before, and pre&s;enting it to her, &s;aid with the mo&s;t graceful air, while &s;he looked plea&s;ed with his agreeable flattery, Now, Madam, repent of all the&s;e cru|elties you have been guilty of to me; con&s;ider, before you die, how often you have made a poor wretch freeze under your ca&s;ement; you &s;hall die, you tyrant! you &s;hall die, with all tho&s;e in&s;truments of death and de&s;truc|tion about you, with that inchanting &s;mile, tho&s;e killing ringlets of your hair!&mdash;Give fire, &s;aid &s;he, laughing.

<P>I CANNOT think it extravagant to imagine, that mankind are no le&s;s, in proportion, accountable for the ill u&s;e of their dominion over creatures of the lower rank of beings, than for the exerci&s;e of tyranny over their own &s;pecies. The more intirely the inferior crea|tion is &s;ubmitted to our power, the more an&s;werable we &s;hould &s;eem for our mi&s;management of it; and the rather, as the very condition of nature renders the&s;e creatures incapable of receiving any recompence in ano|ther life for their ill treatment in this.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable of tho&s;e noxious animals which have qualities more powerful to injure us, that they naturally avoid mankind, and never hurt us, unle&s;s provoked or nece&s;&s;itated by hunger. Man, on the other hand, &s;eeks out and pur&s;ues even the mo&s;t inoffen&s;ive animals, on purpo&s;e to per&s;ecute and de&s;troy them.</P>
<P><HI>Montaigne</HI> thinks it &s;ome reflection upon human nature it&s;elf, that few people take delight in &s;eeing bea&s;ts care&s;s or play together, but almo&s;t every one is plea&s;ed to &s;ee them lacerate and worry one another. I am &s;orry this temper has become almo&s;t a di&s;tingui&s;hed character of our own nation, from the ob&s;ervation which is made by foreigners of our beloved pa&s;times, bear-beating, cock|fighting, and the like. We &s;hould find it hard to vindi|cate the de&s;troying any thing that has life, merely out of wantonne&s;s; yet in this principle our children are bred up, and one of the fir&s;t plea&s;ures we allow them is the licence of inflicting pain upon poor animals; almo&s;t as &s;oon as we are &s;en&s;ible what life is our&s;elves, we make it our &s;port to take it from other creatures. I cannot but believe a very good u&s;e might be made of the fancy which children have for birds and in&s;ects. Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> takes notice of a mother who permitted them to her chil|dren,
<PB N="100" REF="029518_0051_0FE1CD105F4A9AD8">
but rewarded or puni&s;hed them as they treated them well or ill. This was no other than entering them be times into a daily exerci&s;e of humanity, and improving their very diver&s;ion into a virtue.</P>
<P>I fancy too, &s;ome advantage might be taken of the common notion, that it is ominous or unlucky to de&s;troy &s;ome &s;orts of birds, as &s;wallows or martins; this opinion might po&s;&s;ibly ari&s;e from the confidence the&s;e birds &s;eem to put in us by building under our roofs, &s;o that it is a kind of violation of the laws of ho&s;pitality to murder them. As for robin red-brea&s;ts in particular, it is not improbable they owe their &s;ecurity to the old ballad of the <HI>Children in the Woods.</HI> However it be, I do not know, I &s;ay, why this prejudice, well improved and carried as far as it would go, might not be made to conduce to the pre&s;ervation of many innocent creatures, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> now expo&s;ed to all the wantonne&s;s of an ignorant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">barity.</P>
<P>There are other animals that have the mi&s;fortune, for no manner of rea&s;on, to be treated as common enemies, Wherever found. The conceit that a cat has nine lives, has co&s;t at lea&s;t nine lives in ten of the whole race of them: &s;carce a boy in the &s;treet but has in this point outdone <HI>Hercules</HI> him&s;elf, who was famous for killing a mon&s;ter that had but three lives. Whether the unac|countable animo&s;ity again&s;t this u&s;eful dome&s;tic may be any cau&s;e of the general persecution of owls, (who are a &s;ort of feathered cats) or whether it be only an unrea&s;on|able pique the moderns have taken to a &s;erious counte|nance, I &s;hall not determine; though I am inclined to believe the former; &s;ince I ob&s;erve the whole rea&s;on al|ledged for the de&s;truction of frogs <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> becau&s;e they are like roads. Yet amid&s;t all the misfortunes of the&s;e un|friendly creatures, it is &s;ome happine&s;s that we have not yet taken a fancy to eat them; for &s;hould our country|men refine upon the <HI>French</HI> ever &s;o little, it is not to be conceived to what unheard-of torments, owls, cats, and frogs may yet be re&s;erved.</P>
<P>When we grow up to man, we have another &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;anguinary &s;ports; in particular hunting. I dare not attack a diver&s;ion, which has &s;uch authority and cu&s;tom to &s;upport it, but mu&s;t have leave to be of opinion, that the agitations of that exerci&s;e, with the example and number of the cha&s;ers, not a little contribute to re&s;i&s;t tho&s;e checks,
<PB N="101" REF="029518_0051_0FE1CD105F4A9AD8">
which compa&s;&s;ion would naturally &s;ugge&s;t in behalf of the animal pur&s;ued. Nor &s;hall I &s;ay with Mon&s;ieur <HI>Fleury,</HI> that this &s;port is a remain of <HI>Gothic</HI> barbarity; but I mu&s;t animadvert upon a certain cu&s;tom yet in u&s;e with us, and barbarous enough to be derived from the <HI>Goths,</HI> or even the <HI>Scythians;</HI> I mean the &s;avage compliment our hunt&s;|men pa&s;s upon the ladies of quality, who are pre&s;ent at the death of a &s;tag, when they put the knife into their hand to cut the throat of a helple&s;s, trembling, and weeping creature,
<Q><L><HI>&mdash;That lies beneath the knife,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Looks up, and from her butcher begs her life.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>But if our <HI>&s;ports</HI> are de&s;tructive, our <HI>gluttony</HI> is more &s;o, and in a more in human manner. Lob&s;ters roa&s;ted alive-pigs whipt to death, fowls &s;ewed up, are te&s;timonies of our outrageous luxury. Tho&s;e who (as <HI>Seneca</HI> expre&s;&s;es it) divide their lives betwixt an anxious con&s;cience, and a nau&s;eated &s;tomach, have a ju&s;t reward of their gluttony in the di&s;ea&s;es it brings with it: for human &s;avages, like other wild bea&s;ts, find &s;nares and poi&s;ons in the provi&s;ions of life, and are allured by their appetites to their de|&s;truction. I know nothing more &s;hocking or horrid than the pro&s;pect of one of their kitchens covered with blood, and filled with the cries of creatures expiring in tortures. It gives one an image of the <HI>Giant's</HI> den in a romance, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with the &s;cattered heads and mangled limbs of tho&s;e who were &s;lain by his cruelty.</P>
<P>The excellent <HI>Plutarch,</HI> (who has more &s;trokes of good-nature in his writings than I remember in any author) cites a &s;aying of <HI>Cato</HI> to this effect, "That it is no ea&s;y ta&s;k to preach to the belly, which has no ears. Yet if (&s;ays he) we are a&s;hamed to he &s;o out of fa&s;hion, as not to offend, let us at lea&s;t offend with &s;ome di&s;cretion and mea&s;ure. If we kill an animal for our provi&s;ion, let us do it with the meltings of compa&s;&s;ion; and without tor|menting it. Let us con&s;ider that it is in its own nature cruelty to put a living creature to death; we at lea&s;t de|&s;troy a &s;oul that has &s;en&s;e and perception." In the life of <HI>Cato</HI> the cen&s;or, he takes occa&s;ion, from the &s;evere di&s;|po&s;ition in man, to di&s;cour&s;e in this manner: it thought to be e&s;teemed a happine&s;s to mankind, that our humanity has a wider &s;phere to exert it&s;elf in, than bare ju&s;tice. It
<PB N="102" REF="029518_0052_0FE1BA15EEA6DF00">
is no more than the obligation of our very birth to prac|ti&s;e equity to our kind; but humanity may be extended through the whole order of creatures, even to the mean|e&s;t: &s;uch actions of charity are the overflowings of a mild good nature on all below us. It is certainly the part of a well-natured man to take care of his hor&s;es and dogs, not only in expectation of their labour, while they are foals and whelps, but even when their old age has made them incapable of &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Hi&s;tory tells of a wi&s;e and polite nation that rejected a per&s;on of the fir&s;t quality, who &s;tood for a ju&s;ticiary office, only becau&s;e he had been ob&s;erved in his youth to take plea&s;ure in tearing and murdering birds. And of another, that expelled a man out of the &s;enate, for da&s;h|ing a bird again&s;t the ground which had taken &s;helter in his bo&s;om.</P>
<P>Every one knows how remarkable the <HI>Turks</HI> are for their humanity of this kind: I remember an <HI>Arabian</HI> au|thor, who had written a treati&s;e, to &s;hew how far a man, &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in a de&s;art i&s;land, without any in&s;truction, or &s;o much as the &s;ight of any other man, may, by the pure light of nature, attain the knowledge of philo&s;ophy and virtue. One of the fir&s;t things he makes him ob&s;erve, is that univer&s;al benevolence of na|ture in the protection and pre&s;ervation of its creatures. In imitation of which, the fir&s;t act of virtue he thinks this &s;elf-taught philo&s;opher would of cour&s;e fall into, is to relieve and a&s;&s;i&s;t all the animals about him in their wants and di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>

<P>I WAS la&s;t week taking a &s;olitary walk in the gardens of <HI>Lincoln's Inn;</HI> (a favour that is indulged me by &s;ev|eral of the benchers who are my intimate friends, and grown old with me in this neighbourhood) when, accord|ing to the nature of men in years who have made but little progre&s;s in the advancement of their fortunes or their &s;ame, I was repining on the &s;udden ri&s;e of many per&s;ons who are my juniors, and indeed at the unequal di&s;tribu|tion of wealth, honour, and all other ble&s;&s;ings 'of life. I was lo&s;t in this thought, when the night came upon me, and drew my mind into a far more agreeable con|templation. The heaven above me appeared in all its glories, and pre&s;ented me with &s;uch a hemi&s;phere of &s;tars, as made the mo&s;t agreeable pro&s;pect imaginable to one who delights in the &s;tudy of nature. It happened to be a freezing night, which had purified the whole body of air into &s;uch a bright tran&s;parent aether, as made every
<PB N="104" REF="029518_0053_0FE1CC8F10AD2E28">
con&s;tellation vi&s;ible; and at the &s;ame time, gave &s;uch a particular glowing to the &s;tars, that I thought it the riche&s;t &s;ky I had ever &s;een. I could not but behold a &s;cene &s;o wonderfully adorned and lifted up (if I may be allowed that expre&s;&s;ion) without &s;uitable meditations on the Author of &s;uch illu&s;trious and amazing objects. For, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, philo&s;ophy &s;ugge&s;ts motives to reli|gion, and religion adds plea&s;ure to philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I had recovered my u&s;ual temper and &s;eren|ity of &s;oul, I retired to my lodgings, with the &s;atisfaction of having pa&s;&s;ed away a few hours in the proper employ|ment of a rea&s;onable creature; and promi&s;ing my&s;elf that my &s;lumbers would be &s;weet; I no &s;ooner fell into them, but I dreamed a dream, or &s;aw a vi&s;ion, (for I knew not which to call it) that &s;eemed to ri&s;e out of my even|ing meditation, and had &s;omething in it &s;o &s;olemn and &s;erious, that I cannot forbear communicating it; though I mu&s;t confe&s;s the wildne&s;s of imagination (which in a dream is always loo&s;e and irregular) di&s;covers it&s;elf too much in &s;everal parts of it.</P>
<P>Me thought I &s;aw the &s;ame azure &s;ky diver&s;ified with the &s;ame glorious luminaries which had entertained me a little before I fell a&s;leep. I was looking very atten|tively on that &s;ign in the heavens which is called by the name of the <HI>Balance,</HI> when on a &s;udden there appeared in it an extraordinary light, as if the &s;un &s;hould ri&s;e at mid|night. By its increa&s;ing in breadth and lu&s;tre, I &s;oon found that it approached towards the earth; and at length could di&s;cern &s;omething like a &s;hadow hovering in the mid&s;t of a great glory, which in a little time after I di&s;tinctly perceived to be the figure of a woman. I fan|cied at fir&s;t it might have been the angel, or intelligence, that guided the con&s;tellation from which it de&s;cended; but, upon a nearer view, I &s;aw about her all the emblems with which the Godde&s;s of Ju&s;tice is u&s;ually de&s;cribed. Her countenance was un&s;peakably awful and maje&s;tic, but exqui&s;itely beautiful to tho&s;e who&s;e eyes were &s;trong enough to behold it; her &s;miles tran&s;ported with rap|ture; her frowns terrified to de&s;pair. She held in her hand a mirror, endowed with the &s;ame qualities as that which the painters put into the hand of Truth.</P>
<P>There &s;treamed from it a light, which di&s;tingui&s;hed it&s;elf from all the &s;plendor that &s;urrounded her, more
<PB N="105" REF="029518_0053_0FE1CC8F10AD2E28">
than a fla&s;h of lightning &s;hines in the mid&s;t of day-light. As &s;he moved it in her hand, it brightened the heavens, the air, or the earth. When &s;he had de&s;cended &s;o low as to be &s;een and heard by mortals, to make the pomp of her appearance more &s;upportable, &s;he threw darkne&s;s and clouds about her, that tempered the light into a thou&s;and beautiful &s;hades and colours, and multiplied that lu&s;tre, which before was too &s;trong and dazzling, into a variety of milder glories.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the world was in alarm, and all the inhabitants of it gathered together upon a &s;pacious plain; &s;o that I &s;eemed to have the whole &s;pecies before my eyes. A voice was heard from the clouds, declaring the intention of this vi&s;it, which was to re&s;tore and appro|priate to every one living what was his due. The fear and hope, joy and &s;orrow, which appeared in that great a&s;&s;embly after this &s;olemn declaration, are not to be ex|pre&s;&s;ed. The fir&s;t edict was then pronounced, <HI>that all titles and claims to riches and e&s;tates, or to any part of them, &s;hould be immediately ve&s;ted in the rightful owner.</HI> Upon this the inhabitants of the earth held up the in&s;truments of their tenures, whether in parchment, paper, wax, or any other form of conveyance; and as the godde&s;s moved the mirror of truth, which &s;he held in her hand, &s;o that the light which flowed from it fell upon the multitude, they examined the &s;everal in&s;truments by the beams of it: the rays of the mirror had a particular quality of &s;etting fire to all forgery and fal&s;ehood. The blaze of papers, the melting of &s;eals, and the crackling of parch|ments, made a very odd &s;cene. The fire very often ran through two or three lines only, and then &s;topped. Though I could not but ob&s;erve the flames chiefly broke out among the interlineations, and codicils: the light of the mirror, as it was turned up and down, pierced into all the dark corners and rece&s;&s;es of the univer&s;e, and by that means detected many writings and records which had been hidden or buried by time, chance, or de&s;ign. This occa&s;ioned a wonderful revolution among the people. At the fir&s;t time, the &s;poils of extortion, fraud, robbery, with all the fruits of bribery and corruption, were thrown together in a prodigious pile, that almo&s;t reached to the clouds, and was called <HI>the mount of re&s;titution;</HI> to which all injured per&s;ons were invited, to receive what belonged to them.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="029518_0054_0FE1CC90B11E66E0">
One might &s;ee crowds of people in tattered garments come, up, and change cloaths with others that were dre&s;&s;|ed with lace and embroidery. Several who were plumbs, or very near it, became men of moderate fortunes; and many others, who were overgrown in wealth and po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions, had no more left than what they u&s;ually &s;pent. What moved my concern mo&s;t, was to &s;ee a certain &s;treet of the greate&s;t credit in <HI>Europe,</HI> from one end to the other become bankrupt.</P>
<P>The next command was for the whole body of mankind to &s;eparate them&s;elves into their proper families: which was no &s;ooner done, but an edict was i&s;&s;ued requiring all children <HI>to repair to their true and natural fathers.</HI> This put a great part of the a&s;&s;embly in motion; for as the mirror was moved over them, it in&s;pired every one with &s;uch a natural in&s;tinct, as directed them to their real parents. It was a very melancholy &s;pectacle to &s;ee the fathers of very large families become childle&s;s, and bach|elors undone by a charge of &s;ons and daughters. You might &s;ee a pre&s;umptuous heir of a great e&s;tate a&s;k ble&s;&s;ings of his coachman; and a celebrated toa&s;t paying her duty to a valet de chambre. Many, under vows of celibacy, ap|peared &s;urrounded with a numerous i&s;&s;ue. The change of parentage would have cau&s;ed great lamentation, but, that the calamity was pretty common; and that gener|ally tho&s;e who lo&s;t their children had the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing them put into the hands of their deare&s;t friends. Men were no &s;ooner &s;ettled in their right to their po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions and their progeny, but there was a third order proclaimed, <HI>that all the po&s;ts of dignity and honour in the uni|ver&s;e &s;hould be conferred on per&s;ons of the greate&s;t merit, abilities, and perfections.</HI> The hand&s;ome, the &s;trong, and the weal|thy, immediately pre&s;&s;ed forward; but not being able to bear the &s;plendor of the mirror which played upon their faces, they immediately fell back upon the crowd: but as the godde&s;s tried the multitude by her gla&s;s, as the eagle does its young ones by the lu&s;tre of the &s;un, it was remarkable, that every one turned away his face from it who had not di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf either by virtue, knowl|edge, or capacity in bu&s;ine&s;s, either military or civil. This &s;elect a&s;&s;embly was drawn up in the centre of a pro|digious multitude, which was diffu&s;ed on all &s;ides, and &s;tood ob&s;erving them as idle people u&s;ed to gather about
<PB N="107" REF="029518_0054_0FE1CC90B11E66E0">
a regiment that were exerci&s;ing their arms. They were drawn up in three bodies: in the fir&s;t were the men of virtue, in the &s;econd the men of knowledge, and in the third the men of bu&s;ine&s;s. It was impo&s;&s;ible to look at the fir&s;t column without a &s;ecret veneration, their a&s;pects were &s;o &s;weetened with humanity, rai&s;ed with contempla|tion, emboldened with re&s;olution, and adorned with the mo&s;t agreeable airs, which are tho&s;e that proceed from &s;ecret habits of virtue, I could not but take notice, that there were many faces among them which were unknown, not only to the multitude, but even to &s;everal of their own body.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd column, con&s;i&s;ting of the men of knowl|edge, there had been great di&s;putes before they fell into their ranks, which they did not do at la&s;t, without the po&s;itive command of the godde&s;s who pre&s;ided over the a&s;&s;embly. She had &s;o ordered it, that men of the greate&s;t genius and &s;tronge&s;t &s;en&s;e were placed at the head of the column: behind the&s;e were &s;uch as had formed their minds very much on the thoughts and writings of others. In the rear of the column were men who had more wit than &s;en&s;e, or more learning than under&s;tanding. All living authors of any value were ranged in one of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es; but I mu&s;t confe&s;s I was very much &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee a great body of editors, critics, commentators, and grammarians meet with &s;o ill a reception. They had formed them&s;elves into a body, and, with a great deal of arrogance, demanded the fir&s;t &s;tation in the column of knowledge; but the godde&s;s, in&s;tead of complying with the reque&s;t, clapped them all into liveries, and bid them know them&s;elves for no other but the lacquies of the learned.</P>
<P>The third column were men of bu&s;ine&s;s, and con&s;i&s;ted of per&s;ons of military and civil capacities. The former marched out from the re&s;t, and placed them&s;elves in the front; on which the other &s;hook their heads at them, but did not think fit to di&s;pute the po&s;t with them. I could not but make &s;everal ob&s;ervations upon this la&s;t column of people; but I have certain private rea&s;ons why I do not think fit to communicate them to the public. In order to fill up all the po&s;ts of honour, dignity, and profit, there was a draught made out of each column of men, who were ma&s;ters of all the three qualifications in &s;ome degree,
<PB N="108" REF="029518_0055_0FE1CC9254A946B0">
and were preferred to &s;tations of the fir&s;t rank. The &s;ec|ond draught was made out of &s;uch as were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any two of the qualifications, who were di&s;po&s;ed of in &s;tations of a &s;econd dignity. Tho&s;e who were left, and were endowed only with one of them, had their &s;uitable po&s;ts. When this was over, there remained many places of tru&s;t and profit unfilled, for which there were fre&s;h draughts made out of the &s;urrounding multitude, who had any appearance of tho&s;e excellencies, or were recom|mended by tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them in reality.</P>
<P>All were &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee &s;o many new faces in the mo&s;t eminent dignities; and, for my own part, I was very well plea&s;ed to &s;ee that all my friends either kept their pre&s;ent po&s;ts, or were advanced to higher.</P>
<P>Having filled my paper with tho&s;e particulars of my vi&s;ion which concerned the male part of mankind, I mu&s;t re&s;erve for another occa&s;ion the &s;equel of it, which relates to the fair &s;ex.</P>

<P>THE male world were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by the godde&s;s of ju&s;tice, and di&s;appeared, when on a &s;udden the whole plain was covered with women. So charming a multitude filled my heart with un&s;peakable plea&s;ure; and as the cele&s;tial light of the mirror &s;hone upon their faces, &s;everal of them &s;eemed rather per&s;ons de&s;cended in the trai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the godde&s;s, than &s;uch as were brought before her for their trial. The clack of tongues, and confu&s;ion of voices, in this new a&s;&s;embly, were &s;o very great, that the godde&s;s was obliged to command &s;ilence &s;everal times, and with &s;ome &s;everity, before &s;he could make them atten|tive to the edicts. They were all &s;en&s;ible, that the mo&s;t important affair among womankind was then to be &s;ettled, which every one knows to be the point of place. This had rai&s;ed innumerable di&s;putes among them, and put the whole &s;ex into a tumult. Every one produced her claim, and pleaded her preten&s;ions. Birth, beauty, wit, or wealth, were words that rang in my ears from all parts
<PB N="109" REF="029518_0055_0FE1CC9254A946B0">
of the plain. Some boa&s;ted of the merit of their hu&s;bands, others of their own power in governing them. Some pleaded their un&s;potted virginity; others their numerous i&s;&s;ue. Some valued them&s;elves as they were the mothers, and others as they were the daughters of con&s;iderable per|&s;ons. There was not a &s;ingle accompli&s;hment, unmen|tioned, or unpracti&s;ed. The whole congregation was full of &s;inging, dancing, to&s;&s;ing, ogling, &s;peaking, &s;miling, &s;ighing, fanning, frowning, and all tho&s;e other irre&s;i&s;tible arts which women put in practice to captivate the hearts of rea&s;onable creatures. The godde&s;s, to end the di&s;pute, cau&s;ed it to be proclaimed, That every one &s;hould take place according as &s;he was more or le&s;s beautiful.</P>
<P>This declaration gave great &s;atisfaction to the whole a&s;&s;embly, which immediately bridled up, and appeared in all its beauties. Such as believed them&s;elves graceful in their motions, found an occa&s;ion of falling back, advanc|ing forward, or making a fal&s;e &s;tep, that they might &s;hew their per&s;ons in the mo&s;t becoming air. Such as had fine necks and bo&s;oms, were wonderfully curious to look over the heads of the multitude, and ob&s;erve the mo&s;t di&s;tant parts of the a&s;&s;embly. Several clapped their hands on their foreheads, as helping their &s;ight to look upon the glories that &s;urrounded the godde&s;s, but in reality to &s;hew their fine hands and arms. The ladies were yet better plea&s;ed when they heard, that in the deci&s;ion of this great controver&s;y, each of them &s;hould be her own judge, and take her place according to her own opinion of her&s;elf, when &s;he con&s;ulted her looking-gla&s;s.</P>
<P>The godde&s;s, then let down the mirror of truth in a golden chain, which appeared larger in proportion as it de&s;cended, and approached nearer to the eyes of the be|holders. It was the particular property of this looking-gla&s;s to bani&s;h all fal&s;e appearances, and &s;hew people what they really are. The whole women were repre|&s;ented without regard to the u&s;ual external features, which were made entirely conformable to their real cha|racters. In &s;hort, the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed (taking the whole circle of female perfections) were the mo&s;t beauti|ful; and the mo&s;t defective, the mo&s;t deformed. The godde&s;s &s;o varied the motion of the gla&s;s, and placed it in &s;o many different lights, that each had an opportuni|ty of &s;eeing her&s;elf in it.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="029518_0056_0FE1CC93F2A68998">
It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the rage, the plea&s;ure, or a&s;toni&s;hment, that appeared in each face upon its repre|&s;entation in the mirror; multitudes &s;tarted at their own form, and would have broken the gla&s;s if they could have reached it. Many &s;aw their blooming features wither as they looked upon them, and their &s;elf-admira|tion turning into a loathing and abhorrence. The lady who was thought &s;o agreeable in her anger, and was &s;o often celebrated for a woman of fire and &s;pirit, was fright|ed at her own image, and fancied &s;he &s;aw a fury in the gla&s;s. The intere&s;ted mi&s;tre&s;s beheld a Happy, and the &s;ubtle jilt a Sphynx. I was very much troubled in my own heart, to &s;ee &s;uch a de&s;truction of fine faces; but at the &s;ame time had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing &s;everal improved, which I had before looked upon as the greate&s;t ma&s;ter|pieces of nature. I ob&s;erved that &s;ome few were &s;o hum|ble as to be &s;urprized at their own charms; and that ma|ny a one, who had lived in the retirement and &s;everity of a ve&s;tal, &s;hined forth in all the graces and attractions of a Syren. I was ravi&s;hed at the &s;ight of a particular image in the mirror, which I thought the mo&s;t beautiful object that my eyes ever beheld. There was &s;omething more than human in her countenance; her eyes were &s;o full of light that they &s;eemed to beautify every thing they looked upon. Her face was &s;o enlivened with &s;uch a florid bloom, as did not &s;o properly &s;eem the mark of health as of immortality. Her &s;hape, her &s;tature, and her whole mein, were &s;uch as di&s;tingui&s;hed her even there, where the whole fair &s;ex were a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P>I was impatient to &s;ee the lady repre&s;ented by &s;o divine an image, whom I found to be the per&s;on that &s;tood at my right hand, and in the &s;ame point of view with my&s;elf. This was a little old woman, who in her prime had been about five feet high, though at pre&s;ent &s;hrunk to about three quarters of that mea&s;ure; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> natural a&s;pect was puckered up with wrinkles, and her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> and covered with grey hairs. I had ob&s;erved all along an innocent cheerfulne&s;s in her face, which was now height<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> into rapture, as &s;he beheld her&s;elf in the gla&s;s. It was an odd circum|&s;tance in my dream, (but I cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">bear relating it) I conceived &s;o great an inclination towards her, that I had thoughts of di&s;cour&s;ing her upon the point of marriage, when on a &s;udden &s;he was carried from me; for the word
<PB N="111" REF="029518_0056_0FE1CC93F2A68998">
was now given, that all who were plea&s;ed with their own images &s;hould &s;eparate, and place them&s;elves at the head of their &s;ex.</P>
<P>This detachment was afterwards divided into three bodies, con&s;i&s;ting of maids, wives, and widows; the wives being placed in the middle, with the maids on the right, and the widows on the left: though it was with difficulty that the&s;e two la&s;t bodies were hindered from falling into the centre. This &s;eparation of tho&s;e who I ed their real &s;elves, not having le&s;&s;ened the number of the main body &s;o con&s;iderably as it might have been wi&s;hed, the godde&s;s, after having drawn up her mirror, thought fit to make new di&s;tinctions among tho&s;e who did not like the figures they &s;aw in it. She made &s;everal whole&s;ome e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">cts, which are &s;lipt out of my mind; but there were two which dwelt upon it, as being very ex|traordinary in their kind, and executed with great &s;ever|ity. Their de&s;ign was to make an example of two ex|tremes in the female world; of tho&s;e who were very &s;e|vere on the conduct of others, and of tho&s;e who were very regardle&s;s of their own. The fir&s;t &s;entence therefore the godde&s;s pronounced was. That all females addicted to cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s and detraction <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> lo&s;e the u&s;e of &s;peech: a puni&s;hment which would to most grievous to the offen|der, and what &s;hould be the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nd of all puni&s;hments, effectual for rooting out the crime. Upon this edict, which was as &s;oon executed as publi&s;hed, the noi&s;e of this a&s;&s;embly con&s;iderably abated. It was a melancholy &s;pact<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e to &s;ee &s;o many who had the reputation of rigid virtue &s;truck dumb. A lady who &s;tood by me, and &s;aw my concern, told me, &s;he wondered how I could be concerned for &s;uch a pack of&mdash;. I found, by the &s;haking of her head, &s;he was going to give me their cha|racters; but by her &s;aying no more, I perceived &s;he had lo&s;t the command of her tongue. This calamity fell very heavy upon that part of women who are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Prudes, a courtly word for female hypocrites, who have a &s;hort way of being virtuous, by &s;hewing that others are vicious. The &s;econd &s;entence was then pro|nounced again&s;t the loo&s;e part of the &s;ex, That all &s;hould immediately be pregnant, who in any part of their life had run the hazard of it. This produced a very goodly appearance, and revealed &s;o many mi&s;conducts, that made
<PB N="112" REF="029518_0057_0FE1CCA11871ACD8">
that who were lately &s;truck dumb, repine more than ever at their want of utterance; though, at the &s;ame time, (as afflictions &s;eldom come &s;ingle) many of the mutes were al&s;o &s;eized with this new calamity. The ladies were now in &s;uch a condition that they would have wanted room, had not the plain been large enough to let them divide their ground, and extend their lines or all &s;ides.

<P>IT plea&s;ed the mighty &s;overeign <HI>Abbas-Cara&s;can,</HI> from whom the kings of the earth derive honour and do|minion, to &s;et <HI>Mirza</HI> his &s;ervant over the province of <HI>Tauris.</HI> In the hand of <HI>Mirza</HI> the balance of di&s;tribu|tion was &s;plendid with impartiality; and under his ad|mini&s;tration the weak were protected, the learned receiv|ed honour, and the diligent became rich: <HI>Mirza,</HI> there|fore, was beheld by every eye with complacency, and every tongue pronounced ble&s;&s;ings on his head. But it was ob&s;erved that he derived no joys from the benefits which he diffu&s;ed; he became pen&s;ive and melancholy; he &s;pent his lei&s;ure in &s;olitude: In his palace he &s;at motion|le&s;s upon a &s;ofa; and when he went out, his walk was &s;low, and his eyes were fixed upon the ground: he ap|plied to the bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;tate with reluctance; and re&s;ol|ved to relinqui&s;h the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> government, of which he could no longer enjoy the reward.</P>
<P>He therefore obtained permi&s;&s;ion to approach the throne of his Sovereign; and being a&s;ked what was his reque&s;t, he made this reply, "May the Lord of the world forgive the &s;lave whom he has honoured, if <HI>Mirza</HI> pre|&s;ume he again to lay the bounty of <HI>Abbas</HI> at his feet. Thou ha&s;t given me the dominion of a country, fruitful as the gardens of <HI>Dama&s;cus;</HI> and of a city, glorious above all others, except that only which reflects the &s;plendor of thy pre&s;ence. But the longe&s;t life is a period &s;carce &s;uf|ficient to prepare for death: all other bu&s;ine&s;s is vain and trivial, as the toil of emmets in the path of the trav|eller, under who&s;e foot they peri&s;h for ever; and all enjoyment is un&s;ub&s;tantial and evane&s;cent, as the colours of the bow that appear in the interval of a &s;torm. Suffer me therefore, to prepare for the approach of eternity; let me give up my &s;oul to meditation; let &s;olitude and &s;ilence acquaint me with the my&s;teries of devotion; let me forget the world, and by the world be forgotten, till the moment arrives in which the veil of eternity &s;hall fall, and I &s;hall be found at the bar of the Almighty." <HI>Mirza</HI> then bowed him&s;elf to the earth, and &s;tood &s;ilent.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="029518_0058_0FE1CCA45021F970">
By the command of <HI>Abbas</HI> it is recorded, that at the&s;e words he trembled upon that throne at the foot&s;tool of which the world pays homage. He looked round upon his nobles; but every countenance was pale, and every eye was upon the earth. No man opened his mouth; and the King fir&s;t broke &s;ilence, after it had continued an hour.</P>
<P><HI>"Mirza,</HI> terror and doubt are come upon me: I am alarmed, as a man who &s;uddenly perceives that he is near the brink of a precipice, and is urged forward by an irre|&s;i&s;tible force; but yet I know not whether my danger is a reality or a dream. I am, as thou art, a reptile of the earth; my life is a moment; and eternity, in which days and years, and ages are nothing; eternity is before me, for which I al&s;o &s;hould prepare: but by whom the mu&s;t the faithful be governed? By tho&s;e only who have no fear of judgment; by tho&s;e alone who&s;e life is brutal; becau&s;e, like brutes, they do not con&s;ider that they &s;hall die. Or who, indeed, are the faithful? Are the bu&s;y multitudes that crowd the city in a &s;tate of perdition? And is the cell of the Dervi&s;e along <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> are of paradi&s;e? To all, the life of a Dervi&s;e is not po&s;&s;ible; to all, there|fore, it cannot be a duty.

<P><HI>Mirza</HI> departed, and on the third day, having receiv|ed no commands, he again reque&s;ted an audience, and it was granted. When he entered the royal pre&s;ence, his countenance appeared more cheerful; he drew a letter from his bo&s;om, and having ki&s;&s;ed it, he pre&s;ented it with his light hand.</P>
<P>"My Lord, &s;aid he, I have learned by this letter, which I received from <HI>Co&s;rou</HI> the Iman, who now &s;tands before thee, in what manner life may be be&s;t improved. I am enabled to look back with plea&s;ure, and forward with hope; and I &s;hall now rejoice &s;till to be the &s;hadow of thy power at <HI>Tauris,</HI> and to keep tho&s;e honours which I &s;o lately wi&s;hed to re&s;ign." The king, who had li&s;tened to <HI>Mirza</HI> with a mixture of &s;urprize and curio&s;ity, imme|diately gave the letter to <HI>Co&s;rou,</HI> and commanded that it &s;hould be read. The eyes of the court were at once

turned on the hoary &s;age, who&s;e countenance was &s;uffu|&s;ed with an hone&s;t blu&s;h; and it was not without &s;ome he&s;itation that he read the&s;e words:</P>
<P>"To <HI>Mirza,</HI> whom the wi&s;dom of <HI>Abbas</HI> our mighty Lord has honoured with dominion, be everla&s;ting health! When I heard thy purpo&s;e to withdraw the ble&s;&s;ings of thy government from the thou&s;ands of <HI>Tauris,</HI> my heart was wounded with the arrow of affliction, and my eyes became dim with &s;orrow. But who &s;hall &s;peak before the King, when he is troubled? And who &s;hall boa&s;t of knowledge, when he is di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by doubt? To thee I will relate the events of my youth, which thou ha&s;t re|newed before me; and tho&s;e truths which they taught me, may the Prophet multiply to thee.</P>
<P>"Under the in&s;truction of the phy&s;ician <HI>Aluazer,</HI> I ob|tained an early knowledge of his art. To tho&s;e who were &s;mitten with di&s;ea&s;es, I could admini&s;ter plants which the &s;un had impregnated with the &s;pirit of health. But the &s;cenes of pain, languor, and mortality, which were perpetually ri&s;ing before me, made me often trem|ble for my&s;elf. I &s;aw the grave open at my feet: I de|termined therefore, to contemplate only the regions be|yond it, and to de&s;pi&s;e every acqui&s;ition which I could not keep. I conceived an opinion, that as there was no merit but a voluntary poverty, and &s;ilent meditation, tho&s;e who de&s;ired money were not proper objects of boun|ty; therefore money was de&s;pi&s;ed. I buried mine in the earth; and renouncing &s;ociety, I wandered into a wild and &s;eque&s;tered part of the country; my dwelling was a cave by the &s;ide of a hill; I drank the running water from the &s;pring, and eat &s;uch fruits and herbs as I could find. To increa&s;e the au&s;terity of my life, I frequently watched all night, &s;itting at the entrance of the cave with my face to the ea&s;t, re&s;igning my&s;elf to the &s;ecret influ|ences of the Prophet, and expecting illumination from above. One morning after my nocturnal vigil, ju&s;t as I perceived the horizon glow at the approach of the &s;un, the power of &s;leep became irre&s;i&s;tible, and I &s;unk under it. I imagined my&s;elf &s;till &s;itting at the entrance of my cell; that the dawn increa&s;ed, and that as I looked earn|e&s;tly for the fir&s;t beam of day, a dark &s;pot appeared to intercept it. I perceived that it was in motion: it in|crea&s;ed in &s;ize as it drew near, and at length I di&s;covered
<PB N="116" REF="029518_0059_0FE1CCA5EBFD2778">
it to be an eagle. I &s;till kept my eye fixed &s;tedfa&s;tly up|on it, and &s;aw it alight at a &s;mall di&s;tance; where I now de&s;cried a fox, who&s;e two fore legs appeared to be broken. Before this fox the eagle laid part of a kid, which it had brought in its talons, and then di&s;appeared. When I awoke, I laid my forehead upon the ground, and ble&s;&s;ed the Prophet for the in&s;truction of the morning. I re|viewed my dream, and &s;aid thus to my&s;elf, <HI>"Co&s;rou,</HI> thou ha&s;t done well to renounce the tumult, the bu&s;ine&s;s, and the vanities of life; but thou ha&s;t as yet only done it in part: thou art &s;till every day bu&s;ied in &s;earch of food; thy mind is not wholly at re&s;t, neither is thy tru&s;t in Providence complete. What art thou taught by this vi&s;ion? If thou ha&s;t &s;een an eagle commi&s;&s;ioned by hea|ven to feed a fox that was lame, &s;hall not the hand of heaven al&s;o &s;upply thee with food; when that which pre|vents thee from procuring it to thy&s;elf is not nece&s;&s;ity, but devotion?" I was now &s;o confident of a miraculous &s;upply, that I neglected to walk out for my repa&s;t, which, after the fir&s;t day, I expected with an impatience that left me little power of attending to any other object: this impatience, however, I laboured to &s;uppre&s;s, and per&s;i&s;ted in my re&s;olution; but my eyes at length began to fail me, and my knees &s;mote each other: I threw my|&s;elf backward, and hoped my weakne&s;s would &s;oon in|crea&s;e to in&s;en&s;ibility. But I was &s;uddenly rou&s;ed by the voice of an invi&s;ible being, who pronounced the&s;e words: <HI>"Co&s;rou,</HI> I am the angel who, by the command of the Almighty, have regi&s;tered the thoughts of thy heart, which I am now commi&s;&s;ioned to reprove. Whil&s;t thou waft attempting to become wi&s;e above that which is re|vealed, thy fully has perverted the in&s;tructions which were vouch&s;afed to thee. Art thou di&s;abled as the fox <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Ha&s;t thou not rather the powers of the eagle? Ari&s;e, let the eagle be the object of thy emulation. To pain and &s;ickne&s;s be thou again the me&s;&s;enger of ea&s;e and health. Virtue is not re&s;t, but action. If thou do&s;t good to man, as an evidence of thy love to God, thy virtue will be ex|alted from moral to divine; and that happine&s;s, which is the pledge of paradi&s;e, will be thy reward upon earth."</P>
<P>"At the&s;e words, I was not le&s;s a&s;toni&s;hed than if a mountain had been overturned at my feet. I humbled my&s;elf in the du&s;t; I returned to the city. I dug up
<PB N="117" REF="029518_0059_0FE1CCA5EBFD2778">
my trea&s;ure; I was liberal, yet I became rich. My &s;kill in re&s;toring health to the body gave me frequent opportunities of curing the di&s;ea&s;es of the &s;oul. I put on the &s;acred ve&s;tments; I grew eminent beyond my merit; and it was the plea&s;ure of the King that I &s;hould &s;tand before him. Now, therefore, be not offended; I boa&s;t of no knowledge that I have not re|ceived. As the &s;ands of the de&s;art drink up the drops of rain, or the dew of the morning; &s;o do I al&s;o, who am but du&s;t, imbibe the in&s;tructions of the Prophet. Believe, then, that it is he who tells thee, all knowledge is profane which terminates in thy&s;elf; and by a life wa&s;ted in &s;peculation, little even of this can be gained. When the gates of paradi&s;e are thrown open before thee, thy mind &s;hall be irradiated in a moment. Here thou can&s;t little more than pile error upon error; there thou &s;hall build truth upon truth. Wait, therefore, for the glorious vi&s;ion; and, in the mean time, emulate the ea|gle. Much is in thy power, and therefore much is ex|pected of thee. Though the Almighty only can give virtue; yet, as a prince, thou may&s;t &s;timulate tho&s;e to beneficence, who act from no higher motive than imme|diate intere&s;t; thou can&s;t not produce the principle, but may&s;t enforce the practice. The relief of the poor is equal, whether they receive it from o&s;tentation or charity; and the effect of example is the &s;ame, whether it be in|tended to obtain the favour of God or man. Let thy virtue be thus diffu&s;ed; and if thou believe&s;t with rever|ence, thou &s;halt be accepted above. Farewell.&mdash;May the &s;mile of <HI>him</HI> who re&s;ides in the Heaven of heavens be upon thee! and again&s;t thy name, in the volume of <HI>his</HI> will, may Happine&s;s be written!"</P>
<P>The King, who&s;e doubts, like tho&s;e of <HI>Mirza,</HI> were now removed, looked up with a &s;mile that communicated the joy of his mind. He di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the prince to his gov|ernment; and commanded tho&s;e events to be recorded, to the end that po&s;terity may know, "That no life is plea&s;ing to God, but that which is u&s;eful to mankind!"</P>

<P>I WAS the other day buried in the deepe&s;t contemplation, on reading that paper of the <HI>Guardian</HI> in which we are pre&s;ented with a view of that impartial court of ju&s;tice in the infernal regions, where mankind (according to the ancient mythology) are &s;uppo&s;ed to be dealt with in pro|portion to their good or evil actions while or earth. In the mid&s;t of this reverie, I was &s;eized with a profound &s;leep when methought I was in that part of the lower regions I had been reading of. The great hurry and fatigue of bu&s;i|ne&s;s made <HI>Minos</HI> (who then &s;at as judge) to be de&s;irous of &s;ome re&s;pite; for which rea&s;on he left <HI>Common Sen&s;e,</HI> lately arrived from the upper world, to officiate in his room.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t who appeared before this new &s;ub&s;titute of <HI>Minos,</HI> was a figure that approached with an ea&s;y a&s;&s;urance in his countenance; he &s;miled on the court with a &s;eeming complacency; and laid-claim to <HI>Ely&s;ium,</HI> from the many generous and friendly actions of his life. No public &s;ub|&s;cription was attempted, but he was among the fir&s;t to encourage it; no acquaintance in di&s;tre&s;s, but he contri|buted to their relief: In &s;hort, he was looked upon, while on earth, as a humane, generous man; beloved by his neighbours, and e&s;teemed by his acquaintances; but on further examination, it was proved, that this very per&s;on was mean enough to become a &s;lave to a party for a pen|&s;ion; that though &s;eemingly humane to individuals, he was a betrayer and ruiner of his country's intere&s;t; and his &s;eeming virtues proceeded not from any goodne&s;s of heart, but an o&s;tentation to keep up the empty &s;hews of con&s;equential grandeur. On which <HI>Common Sen&s;e</HI> with a look of &s;everity, telling him, that of all cruelty, that towards the public was the mo&s;t unpardonable, nodded towards a black officer on the left to take him into cu&s;tody. This was no &s;ooner done, than another gho&s;t was brought forward, who amazed the whole court with his unac|countable behaviour. When a&s;ked to what purpo&s;e he had lived fifty-three years and &s;ome odd months; in the mo&s;t carele&s;s, pick-tooth manner, with his eyes half &s;hut, he replied, None: and being told that was not a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer, he retorted with a gape&mdash;Perhaps &s;o. In
<PB N="119" REF="029518_0060_0FE1CCA78DBBF5F0">
a word, he was found to be &s;uch a one as <HI>Prior</HI> de&s;cribes:
<Q><L><HI>He &s;oundly &s;lept the night away,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And ju&s;t did nothing all the day.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>This pretty gentleman being informed that indolence was not the road to <HI>Ely&s;ium,</HI> was ordered to ca&s;t off to the left. To him &s;ucceeded a fir&s;t mini&s;ter of &s;tate: but it being proved, on his trial, that nature had de&s;igned him for a juggler, and that he had by mi&s;take been forced to animate the wrong body, he was remanded back again to earth, to &s;hine in his proper &s;phere. I was buried in thought for &s;ome time at what I &s;aw, when I awakened out of my reverie, at the appearance of a gho&s;t with a bloated countenance; who, on being a&s;ked what &s;ort of a life he had led; an&s;wered, A very harmle&s;s one; that from the moment he had come to his e&s;tate, he had never known what it was to be thoroughly &s;ober; and that he had con&s;equently been a friend to his country by promo|ting the exci&s;e; and as it was his fortune to be taken off in a drunken fit&punc; he humbly hoped he might be ranked among tho&s;e who died in the &s;ervice of their country. The court was &s;ome time puzzled to find out a proper puni&s;hment for a life &s;o &s;candalou&s;ly mi&s;pent: they knew flames would be thrown away upon him: but at length his &s;tation was fixed among the &s;uicides, the mo&s;t di&s;mal, melancholy &s;pot in hell.</P>
<P>Quite different from the former was the next that was called upon. It was a young creature, with an un&s;peak|able innocence and &s;weetne&s;s in her countenance, attend|ed with a melancholy and wanne&s;s, which &s;eemed deeply rooted in her. When the u&s;ual que&s;tion was put, in|&s;tead of an&s;wering, &s;he bur&s;t into a flood of tears, nor was &s;he able to utter one word; but a neighbouring gho&s;t, who happened to arrive about the &s;ame time, in|formed <HI>Common Sen&s;e</HI> that &s;he had an unblemi&s;hed cha|racter, and was univer&s;ally e&s;teemed for her good nature and &s;en&s;e, till unfortunately &s;he had given credit to the prote&s;tations of a young gentleman, who had avowed in the mo&s;t &s;acred manner to make her his bride; but after gaining his ends, had ba&s;ely de&s;erted her, which flung her into a melancholy that &s;oon put an end to her life. The whole court was moved at the relation; but <HI>Common Sen&s;e</HI> telling her &s;he had already &s;ufficiently expiated for
<PB N="120" REF="029518_0061_0FE1CCB12FD49548">
her credulity, and that the villain who betrayed her was principally to an&s;wer for the crime, ordered the keeper of <HI>Ely&s;ium</HI> to take her into his protection; which he had no &s;ooner done, than &s;orrow fled away, her bloom return|ed, and mode&s;ty and loveline&s;s &s;hone with the mo&s;t be|coming &s;weetne&s;s. Upon &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eing this a whole &s;hoal of coquettes flocked to their trial, not doubting to meet with the &s;ame good fortune; but their gambols had no other effect on <HI>Common Sen&s;e</HI> than to ha&s;ten their filing off to the left. As for Fops, Methodi&s;ts, Jan&s;eni&s;ts, Humbuggers, and others of the &s;ame &s;pecies, as they were known enemies to <HI>Common Sen&s;e,</HI> their trials were deferred till the return of <HI>Minos,</HI> left ju&s;tice from him might &s;eem partial. What &s;eemed to me remarkable was, that <HI>Common Sen&s;e</HI> often mi&s;took Methodi&s;ts for Jan&s;eni&s;ts, and Jan&s;eni&s;ts for Methodi&s;ts; &s;o greatly &s;eemed to him the re&s;emblance between tho&s;e two &s;ectaries.</P>
<P>Room was now made for a lady of figure, who pre&s;&s;ed forward with an ea&s;y freedom in her air, that be&s;poke her u&s;ed to the be&s;t of company. The que&s;tion being put, &s;he declared &s;he had led a life quite gay and polite; that drums, routs, balls, intrigues, dre&s;s, &amp;c. had taken up her whole time; and that in the end &s;he had died a martyr to her politene&s;s, by a violent cold &s;he had got at a ma&s;querade. On being demanded what good &s;he had done? What charities be&s;towed, &amp;c. &amp;c. What good! what charities! replied &s;he; the&s;e are very odd &s;ort of que&s;tions: why, my dear, dear Sir, do you think we fine ladies can have time to think of &s;uch things? No, no; our whole life is taken up with the more important arti|cles of cards, &s;candal, dre&s;s, &amp;c. Away with her, cries <HI>Common Sen&s;e;</HI> to the left with her; make room for her lady&s;hip.

<P>CARAZAN, the merchant of <HI>Bagdat,</HI> was eminent throughout all the Ea&s;t for his avarice and wealth; his original is ob&s;cure as that of the &s;park, which by the colli&s;ion of &s;teel and adamant is &s;truck out of the dark|ne&s;s; and the patient labour of per&s;evering diligence alone had made him rich. It was remembered, that when he was indigent he was thought to be generous; and he was &s;till acknowledged to be inflexibly ju&s;t. But whether in his dealings with men he di&s;covered a perfidy which tempted him to put his tru&s;t in gold; or whether in proportion as he accumulated wealth, he-di&s;covered his own importance by increa&s;e, <HI>Carazan</HI> prized it more as he u&s;ed it le&s;s: he gradually lo&s;t the inclination to do good, as he acquired the power; and as the hand of time &s;cattered &s;now upon his head, the freezing influ|ence extended to his bo&s;om.</P>
<P>But though the door of <HI>Carazan</HI> was never opened by ho&s;pitality, nor his hand by compa&s;&s;ion, yet fear led him con&s;tantly to the mo&s;que at the &s;tated hours of prayer: he performed all the rites of devotion with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous punctuality, and he had thrice paid his vows at the temple of the Prophet. That devotion which ari&s;es from the love of God, and nece&s;&s;arily includes the love of man, as it connects gratitude with beneficence, and exalts that which was mortal to divine, confers new dignity upon goodne&s;s, and is the object not only of affection but of reverence. On the contrary, the devo|tion of the &s;elfi&s;h, whether it be thought to avert the puni&s;hment which every one wi&s;hes to be in&s;licted, or to in&s;ure it by the complication of hypocri&s;y with guilt, never fails to excite indignation and abhorrence. <HI>Cara|zan,</HI>
<PB N="125" REF="029518_0063_0FE1BA1468400808">
therefore, when he had 'locked his door, and turn|ing round with a look of circum&s;pective &s;u&s;picion, pro|ceeded to the mo&s;que, was followed by every eye with &s;ilent malignity; the poor &s;u&s;pended their &s;upplications when he pa&s;&s;ed by; though he was known by every man, yet no man &s;aluted him.</P>
<P>Such had long been the life of <HI>Carazan,</HI> and &s;uch was the character which he had acquired, when notice was given by proclamation, that he was removed to a magnificent building in the center of the city; that his table &s;hould be &s;pread for the hungry, and that the &s;tranger &s;hould be welcome to his bed. The multitude &s;oon ru&s;hed like a torrent to his door, where they beheld him di&s;tributing bread to the hungry, and apparel to the naked, his eye &s;oftened with compa&s;&s;ion, and his cheeks glowing with delight. Every one gazed with a&s;toni&s;h|ment at the prodigy; and the murmur of innumerable voices increa&s;ing like the &s;ound of approaching thunder. <HI>Carazan</HI> beckoned with his hand: attention &s;u&s;pended the tumult in a moment; and be thus gratified the curi|o&s;ity which procured him audience.</P>
<P>To Him who touches the mountains and they &s;moke, the Almighty and the mo&s;t merciful, be everla&s;ting hon|our!&mdash;he hath ordained &s;leep to be the mini&s;ter of in|&s;truction, as his vi&s;ions have reproved me in the night. As I was &s;itting alone in my Haram, with my lamp burn|ing before me, computing the product of my merchan|dize, and exulting in the increa&s;e of my wealth, I fell in|to a deep &s;leep, and the hand of him who dwells in the third heaven was upon me. I beheld the angel of death coming forward like a whirlwind, and he &s;mote me be|fore I could deprecate the blow. At the &s;ame moment I found my&s;elf lifted from the ground, and tran&s;ported with a&s;toni&s;hing rapidity through the region of the air. The earth was contracted to an atom between; and the &s;tars glowed round me with a lu&s;tre that ob&s;cured the &s;un. The gate of paradi&s;e was now in &s;ight; and I was intercepted by a &s;udden brightne&s;s which no human eye could behold: the irrevocable &s;entence was now to be pronounced: my day of probation was pa&s;t, and from the evil of my life nothing could be taken away, nor could any thing be added to the good. When I reflected that my lot for eternity was ca&s;t, which not all the powers of

<P><HI>"Carazan,</HI> thy wor&s;hip has not been accepted, be|cau&s;e it was not prompted by the love of God; neither can thy righteou&s;ne&s;s be rewarded, becau&s;e it was not produced by the love of man: for thy own &s;ake only ha&s;t thou rendered to every man his due: and thou ha&s;t approached the almighty only for thy&s;elf. Thou ha&s;t not looked up with gratitude, nor round thee with kind|ne&s;s. Around thee thou ha&s;t indeed beheld vice and fol|ly: but if vice and folly could ju&s;tify thy par&s;imony, would they not condemn the bounty of heaven? If not upon the fooli&s;h and the vicious, where &s;hall the &s;un dif|fu&s;e his light, or the clouds di&s;til their dew? Where &s;hall the lips of the &s;pring breathe fragrance, or the hand of autumn diffu&s;e plenty? Remember, <HI>Carazan</HI> that thou ha&s;t &s;hut compa&s;&s;ion from thy heart, and gra&s;ped thy trea&s;ures with an hand of iron: thou ha&s;t lived for thy&s;elf; and, therefore, henceforth for ever thou &s;halt &s;ub&s;i&s;t alone. From the light of heaven, and from the &s;ociety of all beings, &s;halt thou be driven; &s;ol|itude &s;hall protract the lingering hours of eternity, and darkne&s;s aggravate the horror of de&s;pair."</P>
<P>At this moment I was driven, by &s;ome &s;ecret and irre|&s;i&s;tible power, through the glowing &s;y&s;tem of creation, and pa&s;&s;ed innumerable worlds in a moment. As I ap|proached the verge of nature, I perceived the &s;hadows of total and boundle&s;s vacuity deepen before me, a dreadful region of eternal &s;ilence, &s;olitude, and darkne&s;s! unutterable horror &s;eized me at the pro&s;pect, and this exclamation bur&s;t from me with all the vehemence of de&s;ire: <HI>Oh! that I had been doomed for ever to the common receptacle of impenitence and guilt! their &s;ociety would have alleviated the torment of de&s;pair, and the rage of fire could not have excluded the comfort of light. Or, if I had been con|demned to re&s;ide on a comet, that would return but once in a thou|&s;and years to the regions of light and life, the hope of the&s;e periods, however di&s;tant, would cheer me in the dreary interval of cold, and darkne&s;s, and the vici&s;&s;itude would divide eternity into time.</HI> While this thought pa&s;&s;ed over my mind, I lo&s;t &s;ight of the remote&s;t &s;tar, and the la&s;t glimmering of light was
<PB N="127" REF="029518_0064_0FE1CCB6F02BD150">
quenched in utter darkne&s;s. The agonies of de&s;pair in|crea&s;ed every moment, as every moment augmented my di&s;tance from the la&s;t habitable world. I reflected with intolerable angui&s;h, that when ten thou&s;and thou&s;and years had carried me beyond the reach of all but that power who fills infinitude, I &s;hould &s;till look forward into an immen&s;e aby&s;s of darkne&s;s, through which I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ould &s;till drive without &s;uccour and without &s;ociety, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ther and f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rther &s;till, for ever and ever. I then &s;tretched out my hands towards the regions of exi&s;tence, with an emotion that awaked me. Thus have I been taught to e&s;timate &s;ociety, like every other ble&s;&s;ing, by its lo&s;s. My heart is warmed to liberality; and I am zealous to communicate the happine&s;s which I feel, to tho&s;e from it is derived; for the &s;ociety of one wretch, whom, in the pride of pro&s;perity, I would have &s;purned from my door, would, in the dreadful &s;olitude to which I was condemned, have been more highly prized than the gold of <HI>Afric,</HI> or the gems of <HI>Golconda.</HI></P>
<P>At this reflection upon his dream, <HI>Carazan</HI> became &s;uddenly &s;ilent, and looked upwards in an ec&s;tacy of gratitude and devotion. The multitude was &s;truck at once with the precept and the example; and the Caliph, to whom the event was related, that he might be liberal beyond the power of gold, commanded it to be recorded for the benefit of po&s;terity.</P>

<P>THOUGH there is a great deal of plea&s;ure in contem|plating the material world, by which I mean that &s;y&s;tem of bodies into which nature has &s;o curiou&s;ly wrought the ma&s;s of dead matter, with the &s;everal rela|tions which tho&s;e bodies bear to one another; there is &s;till, methinks, &s;omething more wonderful and &s;urpri|&s;ing in contemplations on the world of life, by which I mean all tho&s;e animals with which every part of the uni|ver&s;e is furni&s;hed. The material world is only the &s;hell of the univer&s;e: the world of life are its inhabitants.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider tho&s;e parts of the material world which
<PB N="128" REF="029518_0065_0FE1CCB892961A38">
lie the neare&s;t to us, and are therefore &s;ubject to our ob|&s;ervations and inquiries, it is amazing to con&s;ider the infinity of animals with which it is &s;tocked. Every part of matter is peopled: every green leaf &s;warms with in|habitants. There is &s;carce a &s;ingle humour in the body of man, or of any other animal, in which our gla&s;&s;es do not di&s;cover myriads of living creatures. The &s;urface of animals is al&s;o covered with other animals; which are in the &s;ame manner the ba&s;is of other animals that live upon them: nay, we find in the mo&s;t &s;olid bodies, as in marble it&s;elf, innumerable cells and cavities, that are crowded with &s;uch imperceptible inhabitants, as are too little for the naked eye to di&s;cover. On the other hand, if we look into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ore bulky parts of nature, we &s;ee the &s;eas, lakes, and rivers, teeming with numberle&s;s kinds of living creatures, we find every mountain and mar&s;h, wilderne&s;s and wood, plentifully &s;tocked with birds and bea&s;ts, and every part of matter affording proper nece&s;&s;a|ries and conveniencies for the livelihood of multitudes which inhabit it.</P>
<P>The author of the <HI>Plurality of Worlds</HI> draws a very good argument from this con&s;ideration for the <HI>peopling</HI> of every planet; as indeed it &s;eems very probable, from the anal|ogy of rea&s;on, that if no part of matter which we are acquainted with lies wa&s;te and u&s;ele&s;s, tho&s;e great bodies, which are at &s;uch a di&s;tance from us, &s;hould not be de|&s;art and unpeopled, but rather that they &s;hould be fur|ni&s;hed with beings adapted to their re&s;pective &s;ituations.</P>
<P>Exi&s;tence is a ble&s;&s;ing to tho&s;e beings only which are endowed with perception, and is in a manner thrown away upon dead matter, any farther than as it is &s;ub&s;er|vient to beings which are con&s;cious of their exi&s;tence. Accordingly we find, from the bodies which lie under our ob&s;ervation, that matter is only made as the ba&s;is and &s;upport of animals; and that there is no more of the one than what is nece&s;&s;ary to the exi&s;tence of the other.</P>
<P>Infinite goodne&s;s is of &s;o communicative a nature, that it &s;eems to delight in the conferring of exi&s;tence upon every degree of perceptive being. As this is a &s;pecula|tion which I have often pur&s;ued with great plea&s;ure to my&s;elf, I &s;hall enlarge farther upon it, by con&s;idering that part of the &s;cale of being which comes within our knowledge.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="029518_0065_0FE1CCB892961A38">
There are &s;ome living creatures which are rai&s;ed but ju&s;t above dead matter. To mention only that &s;pecies of &s;hell fi&s;h which is formed in the fa&s;hion of a cone, that grow to the &s;urface of &s;everal rocks, and immediately die upon their being &s;evered from the place where they grow. There are many other creatures but one remove from the&s;e, which have no other &s;en&s;e be&s;ides that of feeling and ta&s;te. Others have &s;till an additional one of hear|ing: others of &s;mall, and others of &s;ight. It is wonder|ful to ob&s;erve, by what a gradual progre&s;s the world of life advances through a prodigious variety of &s;pecies, be|fore a creature is formed that is complete in all its &s;en&s;es; and even among the&s;e there is &s;uch a different degree of perfection in the &s;en&s;e which one animal enjoys, beyond what appears in another, that though the &s;en&s;e in differ|ent animals be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the &s;ame common denom|inations, it &s;eems almo&s;t of a different nature. If, after this, we look into the &s;everal inward perfections of cun|ning and &s;agacity, or what we generally call in&s;tinct, we find them ri&s;ing after the &s;ame manner imperceptibly one above another, and receiving additional improvements according to the &s;pecies in which they are implanted. This progre&s;s in nature is &s;o very gradual, that the mo&s;t perfect of an inferior &s;pecies comes very near to the mo&s;t imperfect of that which is immediately above it.</P>
<P>The exuberant and overflowing goodne&s;s of the &s;upreme Being, who&s;e mercy extends to all his works, is plainly &s;een, as I have before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">inted, from his having made &s;o very little matter, at lea&s;t what falls within our knowl|edge, that does not &s;warm with life: no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> is his goodne&s;s le&s;s &s;een in the diver&s;ity, than in the multitude of living creatures. Had he only made one &s;pecies of animals, none of the re&s;t would have enjoyed the happine&s;s of ex|i&s;tence; he has, therefore, <HI>&s;pecified</HI> in his creation every degree of life, every capacity of beings. The whole cha&s;m of nature, from a plant to a man, is filled up with diver&s;e kinds of creatures, ri&s;ing one over another, by &s;uch a gentle and ea&s;y a&s;cent, that the little tran&s;itions and deviations from one &s;pecies to another are almo&s;t in|&s;en&s;ible. This intermediate &s;pace is &s;o well hu&s;banded and managed, that there is &s;carce a degree of perception which does not appear in &s;ome one part of the world of life. Is the goodne&s;s or wi&s;dom of the divine Being more manife&s;ted in this his proceeding?</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="029518_0066_0FE1CCC423BA6C60">
There is a con&s;equence, be&s;ides tho&s;e I have already mentioned, which &s;eems very naturally deducible from the foregoing con&s;iderations. If the &s;cale of being ri&s;es by &s;uch a regular progre&s;s &s;o high as a man, we may, by a parity of rea&s;on, &s;uppo&s;e that it &s;till proceeds gradually through tho&s;e beings which are of a &s;uperior nature to him; &s;ince there is an infinitely greater &s;pace and room for different degrees of perfection between the &s;upreme Being and man, than between man and the mo&s;t de&s;pica|ble in&s;ect. This con&s;equence of &s;o great a variety of beings which are &s;uperior to us, from that variety which is inferior to us, is made by Mr. <HI>Locke,</HI> in a pa&s;&s;age which I &s;hall here &s;et down, after having premi&s;ed, that notwith|&s;tanding there is &s;uch infinite room between man and his Maker for the creative power to exert it&s;elf in, it is impo&s;&s;ible that it &s;hould ever be filled up, &s;ince there will be &s;till an infinite gap or di&s;tance between the highe&s;t created being, and the great power which produced them.</P>
<P>"That there &s;hould be more <HI>&s;pecies</HI> of intelligent crea|tures above us than there are of &s;en&s;ible and material below us, is probable to me from hence, that in all the vi&s;ible corporeal world, we &s;ee no cha&s;ms or gaps. All quite down from us, the de&s;cent is by ea&s;y &s;teps, and a continued &s;eries of things, that each remove differs very little one from the other. There are fi&s;hes that have wings, and are no &s;trangers to the airy region: and there are &s;ome birds, that are inhabitants of the water, who&s;e blood is cold as fi&s;hes, and their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;h &s;o like in ta&s;te, that the &s;crupulous are allowed them on fi&s;h days. There are animals &s;o near akin both to birds and bea&s;ts, that they are in the middle between both: amphibious ani|mals link the terre&s;trial and aquatic together: &s;eals live on land and at &s;ea, and porpoi&s;es have the warm blood and entrails of a hog; not to mention what is confidently reported of mermaids, or &s;ea-men. There are &s;ome brutes that &s;eem to have as much knowledge and rea&s;on as &s;ome that are called men; and the animal and vege|table kingdoms are &s;o nearly joined, that if you will take the lowe&s;t of the one, and the highe&s;t of the other, there will &s;carce be perceived any great difference between them: and &s;o on, until we come to the lowe&s;t and the mo&s;t inorganical parts of matter, we &s;hall find every where that the &s;everal &s;pecies are linked together, and
<PB N="131" REF="029518_0066_0FE1CCC423BA6C60">
differ but in almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible degrees. And when we con&s;ider the infinite power and wi&s;dom of the Maker, we have rea&s;on to think, that it is &s;uitable to the magnif|icent harmony of the univer&s;e, and the great de&s;ign and infinite goodne&s;s of the Architect, that the <HI>&s;pecies</HI> of crea|tures &s;hould al&s;o, by gentle degrees, a&s;cend upwards from us towards his infinite perfection, as we &s;ee they gradually de&s;cend from us downwards: which, if it be probable, we have rea&s;on then to be per&s;uaded, that there are far more &s;pecies of creatures above us than there are beneath; we being in a degree of perfection much more remote from the infinite being of God than we are from the lowe&s;t &s;tate of being, and that which approaches neare&s;t to nothing; and yet of all tho&s;e di&s;tinct <HI>&s;pecies</HI> we have no clear di&s;tinct ideas."</P>
<P>In this &s;y&s;tem of being there is no creature &s;o wonder|ful in its nature, and which &s;o much de&s;erves our par|ticular attention as man, who fills up the middle &s;pace between the animal and the intellectual nature, the vi&s;i|ble and invi&s;ible world, and is that link in the chain of beings which has been often termed the <HI>Nexus utriu&s;que Mundi.</HI> So that he who in one re&s;pect is a&s;&s;ociated with angels and archangels, may look upon a being of infin|ite perfection as his father, and the highe&s;t order of &s;pirits as his brethren; may, in another re&s;pect, &s;ay to <HI>corruption, Thou art my father; and to the worm, Thou art my mother and &s;i&s;ter.</HI></P>

<P>THOSE who were &s;killed in anatomy among the an|cients concluded, from the outward and inward make of a human body, that it was the work of a being tran&s;cendently wi&s;e and powerful. As the world grew more enlightened in this art, their di&s;coveries gave them fre&s;h opportunities of admiring the conduct of providence in the formation of a human body. <HI>Galen</HI> was converted by his di&s;&s;ections; and could not but own a &s;upreme

Being upon a &s;urvey of this his handy-work. There were, indeed, many parts of which the old anatomi&s;ts did not know the certain u&s;e; but as they &s;aw that mo&s;t of tho&s;e which they examined were adapted with admirable art to their &s;everal functions, they did not que&s;tion but tho&s;e who&s;e u&s;es they could not determine were contrived with the &s;ame wi&s;dom for re&s;pective ends and purpo&s;es. Since the circulation of the blood has been found out, and many other great di&s;coveries have been made by our modern anatomi&s;ts, we &s;ee new wonders in the human frame, and di&s;cern &s;everal important u&s;es for tho&s;e parts which the ancients knew nothing of. In &s;hort, the body of man is &s;uch a &s;ubject as &s;tands the utmo&s;t te&s;t of exam|ination. Though it appears formed with the nice&s;t wi&s;dom, upon the mo&s;t &s;uperficial &s;urvey of it, it &s;till mends upon the &s;earch, and produces our &s;urpri&s;e and amazement in proportion as we pry into it. What I have here &s;aid of a human body may be applied to the body of every animal which has been the &s;ubject of an anatomical ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>The body of an animal is an object adequate to our &s;en&s;es. It is a particular &s;y&s;tem of providence, that lies in a narrow compa&s;s. The eye is able to command it, and by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive inquiries can &s;earch into all its parts. Could the body of the whole earth, or indeed the whole univer&s;e, be thus &s;ubmitted to the examination of our &s;en&s;es, were it not too big and di&s;proportioned for our inquiries, too unwieldy for the management of the eye and hand, there is no que&s;tion but it would appear to us as curious and well-contrived a frame as that of a human body. We could &s;ee the &s;ame concatenation and &s;ub&s;er|vience, the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity and u&s;efulne&s;s, the &s;ame beau|ty and harmony in all and every of its parts, as what we di&s;cover in the body of every &s;ingle animal.</P>
<P>The more extended our rea&s;on is, and the more able to grapple the immen&s;e objects, the greater &s;till are tho&s;e di&s;coveries which it makes of wi&s;dom and providence in the works of the creation. A Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> who &s;tands up as the miracle of the pre&s;ent age, can look through a whole planetary &s;y&s;tem; con&s;ider it in its weight, num|ber, and mea&s;ure; and draw from it as many demon&s;tra|tions of infinite power and wi&s;dom, as a more confined under&s;tanding is able to deduce from the &s;y&s;tem of a human body.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="029518_0067_0FE1CCC6E92C34F8">
But to return to our &s;peculations on anatomy. I &s;hall here con&s;ider the frabic and texture of the bodies of ani|mals in one particular view; which, in my opinion, &s;hews the hand of a thinking and all-wi&s;e Being in their forma|tion, with the evidence of a thou&s;and demon&s;trations. I think we may lay this down as an inconte&s;tible principle, that chance never acts in a perpetual uniformity and con|&s;i&s;tency with it&s;elf. If one &s;hould always fling the &s;ame number with ten thou&s;and dice, or &s;ee every throw ju&s;t five times le&s;s, or five times more in number than the throw which immediately preceded it, who would not imagine there is &s;ome invi&s;ible power which directs the ca&s;t? This is the proceeding which we find in the oper|ations of nature. Every kind of animal is diver&s;ified by different magnitudes, each of which gives ri&s;e to a differ|ent &s;pecies. Let a man trace the dog or lion kind, and he will ob&s;erve how many of the works of nature are publi&s;hed, if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion, in a variety of editions. If we look into the reptile world, or into tho&s;e different kinds of animals that fill the element of water, we meet with the &s;ame repetitions among &s;everal &s;pecies, that differ very little from one another but in &s;ize and bulk. You find the &s;ame creature that is drawn at large, copied out in &s;everal proportions, and ending in minia|ture. It would be tedious to produce in&s;tances of this regular conduct in Providence, as it would be &s;uperfluous to tho&s;e who are ver&s;ed in the natural hi&s;tory of animals. The magnificent harmony of the univer&s;e is &s;uch, that we may ob&s;erve innumerable <HI>divi&s;ions</HI> running upon the &s;ame ground. I might al&s;o extend this &s;peculation to the dead parts of nature, in which we may find matter di&s;po&s;ed into many <HI>&s;imilar</HI> &s;y&s;tems, as well in our &s;urvey of &s;tars and planets, as of &s;tones, vegetables, and other &s;ublunary parts of the creation. In a word, Providence has &s;hewn the richne&s;s of its goodne&s;s and wi&s;dom, not only in the production of many original &s;pecies, but in the multiplicity of de&s;cents which it has made on every original &s;pecies in particular.</P>
<P>But to pur&s;ue this thought &s;till farther: every living creature con&s;idered in it&s;elf has many very complicated parts that are exact copies of &s;ome other parts which it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, and which are complicated in the &s;ame manner. One eye would have been &s;ufficient for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence
<PB N="134" REF="029518_0068_0FE1CCC88C0E5590">
and pre&s;ervation of an animal; but, in order to better his condition, we &s;ee another placed with a mathematical exactne&s;s in the &s;ame mo&s;t advantageous &s;ituation, and in every particular of the &s;ame &s;ize and texture. Is it po&s;&s;ible for chance to be &s;o uniform in her operations? Should a million of dice turn up twice together the &s;ame number, the wonder would be nothing in compari&s;on of this. But when we &s;ee this &s;imilitude and re&s;emblance in the arm, the hand, the fingers; when we &s;ee one half of the body entirely corre&s;pond with the other in all tho&s;e minute &s;trokes, without which a man might very well have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted: nay, when we often &s;ee a &s;ingle part repeated an hundred times in the &s;ame body, notwith|&s;tanding it con&s;i&s;ts in the mo&s;t intricate weaving of num|berle&s;s fibres, and tho&s;e parts differing &s;till in magnitude, as the convenience of their particular &s;ituation requires; &s;urely man mu&s;t have a &s;trange ca&s;t of under&s;tanding, who does not di&s;cover the finger of God in &s;o wonderful a work. The&s;e duplicates in tho&s;e parts of the body, without which a man might have very well &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, though not &s;o well as with them, are a plain demon&s;tra|tion of an all-wi&s;e Contriver; as tho&s;e more numerous copyings, which are found among the ve&s;&s;els of the &s;ame body, are evident demon&s;trations that they could not be the work of chance. This argument receives additional &s;trength, if we apply it to every animal and in&s;ect within our knowledge, as well as to tho&s;e numberle&s;s living crea|tures that are objects too minute for the human eye: and if we con&s;ider how the &s;everal &s;pecies in this whole world of life re&s;emble one another in very many particulars, &s;o far as is convenient for their re&s;pective &s;tates of exi&s;t|ence, it is much more probable, that an hundred million of dice &s;hould be ca&s;ually thrown a hundred million of times in the &s;ame number, than that the body of any &s;in|gle animal &s;hould be produced by the fortuitous con|cour&s;e of matter. And that the like chance &s;hould ari&s;e in innumerable in&s;tances, requires a degree of credulity that is not under the direction of common &s;en&s;e. We may carry this con&s;ideration yet farther, if we reflect on the two &s;exes in every living &s;pecies, with their re&s;em|blances to each other, and tho&s;e particular di&s;tinctions that were nece&s;&s;ary for the keeping up of this great world of life.</P>

There are many more demon&s;trations of a Supreme Being, and of his tran&s;cendent wi&s;dom, power, and goodne&s;s, in the formation of the body of a living crea|ture; for which I refer my reader to other writings, par|ticularly to the &s;ixth book of the poem entitled <HI>Creation,</HI> where the anatomy of the human body is de&s;cribed with great per&s;picuity and elegance.</P>

<P>I WAS ye&s;terday about &s;un-&s;et walking in the open fields, till the night in&s;en&s;ibly fell upon me. I at fir&s;t amu&s;ed my&s;elf with all the richne&s;s and variety of colours which appeared in the we&s;tern parts of heaven: in proportion as they faded away and went out, &s;everal &s;tars and planets appeared, one after another, until the whole firmament was in a glow. The bluene&s;s of the aether was exceedingly heightened and enlivened by the &s;ea&s;on of the year, and by the rays of all tho&s;e luminaries that pa&s;&s;ed through it. The <HI>Galaxy</HI> appeared in its mo&s;t beautiful white. To complete the &s;cene, the full moon ro&s;e at length in that clouded maje&s;ty which <HI>Milton</HI> takes notice of, and opened to the eye a new picture of nature, which was more finely &s;haded, and di&s;po&s;ed among &s;ofter lights, than that which the &s;un had before di&s;covered to us.</P>
<P>As I was &s;urveying the moon walking in her bright|ne&s;s, and taking her progre&s;s among the con&s;tellations, a thought aro&s;e in me, which I believe very often perplexes and di&s;turbs man of a &s;erious and contemplative nature. <HI>David</HI> him&s;elf fell into it in that reflection, "When I con&s;ider the heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the &s;tars, which thou ha&s;t ordained; what is man, that thou art mindful of him! and the &s;on of man, that thou regarde&s;t him!" In the &s;ame manner, when I con|&s;ider the infinite ho&s;t of &s;tars, or, to &s;peak more philo&s;o|phically, of &s;uns, which were then &s;hining upon me, with tho&s;e innumerable &s;ets of planets or worlds which were moving round their re&s;pective &s;uns; when I &s;till enlar|ged
<PB N="136" REF="029518_0069_0FE1CCCA29B67780">
the idea, and &s;uppo&s;ed another heaven of &s;uns, and worlds ri&s;ing &s;till above this which we di&s;covered, and the&s;e &s;till enlightened by a &s;uperior firmament of lumi|naries, which are planted at &s;o great a di&s;tance, that they may appear to the inhabitants of the former as the &s;tars do to us: in &s;hort, while I pur&s;ued this thought, I could not but reflect on that little in&s;ignificant figure which I my&s;elf bore amid&s;t the immen&s;ity of God's works.</P>
<P>Were the &s;un, which enlightens this part of the crea|tion, with all the ho&s;ts of planetary worlds that move about him, utterly extingui&s;hed and annihilated, they would not be mi&s;&s;ed more than a grain of &s;and on the &s;ea &s;hore. The &s;pace they po&s;&s;e&s;s is &s;o exceeding little in compari&s;on of the whole, that it would &s;carce make a <HI>blank</HI> in the creation.&mdash;The cha&s;m would be impercept|ible to an eye that could take in the whole compa&s;s of nature, and pa&s;s from one end of creation to the other, as it is po&s;&s;ible there may be &s;uch a &s;en&s;e in our&s;elves hereafter, or in creatures which are at pre&s;ent more ex|alted than our&s;elves. We &s;ee many &s;tars by the help of gla&s;&s;es, which we do not di&s;cover with our naked eye; and the finer our tele&s;copes are, the more &s;till are our di&s;coveries. <HI>Huygenius</HI> carries this thought &s;o far, that he does not think it impo&s;&s;ible but there may be &s;tars who&s;e light has not yet travelled down to us &s;ince their fir&s;t creation. There is no que&s;tion but the univer&s;e has certain bounds &s;et to it; but when we con&s;ider that it is the work of infinite power, prompted by infinite good|ne&s;s, with an infinite &s;pace to exert it&s;elf in, how can our imagination &s;et any bounds to it?</P>
<P>To return therefore to my fir&s;t thought, I could not but look upon my&s;elf with &s;ecret horror, as a being that was not worthy the &s;malle&s;t regard of one who had &s;o great a work under his care and &s;uperintendency. I was afraid of being overlooked amid&s;t the immen&s;ity of na|ture, and lo&s;t among that infinite variety of creatures which in all probability &s;warm through all tho&s;e immea|&s;urable regions of matter.</P>
<P>In order to recover my&s;elf from this mortifying thought, I con&s;idered that it took its ri&s;e from tho&s;e narrow con|ceptions which we are apt to entertain of the divine na|ture. We our&s;elves cannot attend to many different objects at the &s;ame time. If we are careful to in&s;pect
<PB N="137" REF="029518_0069_0FE1CCCA29B67780">
&s;ome things, we mu&s;t of cour&s;e neglect others. This im|perfection which we ob&s;erve in our&s;elves, is an imper|fection which cleaves in &s;ome degree to creatures of the highe&s;t capacities, as they are creatures, that is, beings of finite and limited natures. The pre&s;ence of every cre|ated being is confined to a certain mea&s;ure of &s;pace, and con&s;equently his ob&s;ervation is &s;tinted to a certain num|ber of objects. The &s;phere in which we move, and act, and under&s;tand, is of a wider circumference to one crea|ture than another, according as we ri&s;e one above ano|ther in the &s;cale of exi&s;tence. But the wide&s;t of the&s;e our &s;pheres has its circumference. When therefore we re|flect on the divine nature, we are &s;o u&s;ed and accu&s;tom|ed to this imperfection in our&s;elves, that we cannot for-hear in &s;ome mea&s;ure a&s;cribing it to Him in whom there is no &s;hadow of imperfection. Our rea&s;on, indeed, a&s;&s;ures us, that his attributes are infinite; but the poorne&s;s of our conceptions is &s;uch, that it cannot forbear &s;etting bounds to every thing it contemplates, until our rea&s;on comes again to our &s;uccour, and throws down all tho&s;e little prejudices which ri&s;e in us unawares, and are natu|ral to the mind of man.</P>
<P>We &s;hould therefore utterly extingui&s;h this melancho|ly thought, of our being overlooked by our Maker in the multiplicity of his works, and the infinity of the&s;e ob|jects among which he &s;eems to be ince&s;&s;antly employed; if we con&s;ider, in the fir&s;t place, that he is omnipre&s;ent; and that, in the &s;econd place, he is omni&s;cient.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider him in his omnipre&s;ence, his being pa&s;&s;es through, actuates, and &s;upports the whole frame of nature; his creation, and every part of it, is full of him. There is nothing he has made that is either &s;o di&s;tant, &s;o little, or &s;o incon&s;iderable, which he does not e&s;&s;entially inhabit. His &s;ub&s;tance is within the &s;ub&s;tance of every being, whether material or immaterial, and as intimately pre&s;ent to it as that being is to it&s;elf. It would be an imperfection in him, were he able to remove out of one place into another, or to withdraw him&s;elf from any thing he has created, or from any part of that &s;pace which is diffu&s;ed and &s;pread abroad to infinity. In &s;hort, to &s;peak of him in the language of the old philo&s;opher, he is a Being who&s;e center is every where, and his circumference no where.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="029518_0070_0FE1CCD60CA0D190">
In the &s;econd place, he is omni&s;cient as well as omni|pre&s;ent. His omni&s;cience indeed, nece&s;&s;arily and natu|rally flows from his omnipre&s;ence; he cannot but be con|&s;cious of every motion that ari&s;es in the whole material world, which he thus e&s;&s;entially pervades, and of every thought that is &s;tirring in the intellectual world, to every part of which he is intimately united. Several morali&s;ts have con&s;idered the creation as the temple of God, which he has built with his own hand, and which is filled with his pre&s;ence. Others have con&s;idered infinite &s;pace as the receptacle, or rather the habitation of the Almighty: but the noble&s;t and mo&s;t exalted way of con&s;idering this infinite &s;pace, is that of Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> who calls it the <HI>Sen&s;orium</HI> of the Godhead. Brutes and men have their <HI>&s;en&s;oriola,</HI> or little <HI>&s;en&s;oriums,</HI> by which they apprehend the pre&s;ence, and perceive the actions of a few objects that lie contiguous to them. Their knowledge and ob&s;erva|tion turn within a very narrow circle. But as God Al|mighty cannot but perceive and know every thing in which he re&s;ides, infinite &s;pace gives room to infinite knowledge, and is, as it were, an organ to omni&s;cience.</P>
<P>Were the &s;oul &s;eparated from the body, and with one glance of thought could &s;tart beyond the bounds of the creation; &s;hould it for millions of years continue its progre&s;s through infinite &s;pace with the &s;ame activity, it would &s;till find it&s;elf within the embrace of its Creator, and encompa&s;&s;ed round with the immen&s;ity of the God|head. Whil&s;t we are in the body, he is not le&s;s pre&s;ent with us, becau&s;e he is concealed from us. "O that I knew where I might find him! (&s;ays Job) Behold I go forward, but he is not there! and backward, but I can|not perceive him. On the left hand, where he does work, but I cannot behold him. He hides him&s;elf on the right hand that I cannot &s;ee him." In &s;hort, rea&s;on, as well as revelation a&s;&s;ure us, that he cannot be ab&s;ent from us, notwith&s;tanding he is undi&s;covered by us.</P>
<P>In this con&s;ideration of God Almighty's omnipre&s;ence and omni&s;cience, every uncomfortable thought vani&s;hes. He cannot but regard every thing that has being, e&s;pe|cially &s;uch of his creatures who fear they are not regard|ed by him. He is privy to all their thoughts, and to that anxiety of heart in particular, which is apt to trouble them on this occa&s;ion: for, as it is impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould
<PB N="139" REF="029518_0070_0FE1CCD60CA0D190">
overlook any of his creatures, &s;o we may be confident that he regards, with an eye of mercy, tho&s;e who endea|vour to recommend them&s;elves to his notice, and in an unfeigned humility of heart think them&s;elves unworthy that he &s;hould be mindful of them.</P>

<P>I WAS ye&s;terday walking alone in one of my friend's woods, and lo&s;t my&s;elf in it very agreeably; as I was running over in my mind the &s;everal arguments that e&s;tabli&s;h the great point which is the ba&s;is of mor|ality, and the &s;ource of all the plea&s;ing hopes and &s;ecret joys that can ari&s;e in the heart of a rea&s;onable creature, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the immortality of the &s;oul. I con&s;idered the&s;e &s;ev|eral proofs, drawn,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> From the nature of the &s;oul it&s;elf, and particu|larly its immateriality; which, though not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the eternity of its duration, has, I think, been evinced to almo&s;t a demon&s;tration.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> From its pa&s;&s;ions and &s;entiments, as particu|larly from its love of exi&s;tence, its horror of annihilation, and its hopes of immortality; with that &s;ecret &s;atisfac|tion which it finds in the practice of virtue, and that un|ea&s;ine&s;s which follows in it upon the commi&s;&s;ion of vice.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> From the nature of the Supreme Being, who&s;e ju&s;tice, goodne&s;s, wi&s;dom, and veracity, are all concerned in this great point.</P>
<P>But among&s;t the&s;e and other excellent arguments for the immortality of the &s;oul, there is one drawn from the perpetual progre&s;s of the &s;oul to its perfection, without a po&s;&s;ibility of ever arriving at it; which is a hint that I do not remember to have &s;een opened and improved by others who have written on this &s;ubject, though it &s;eems to me to carry a great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ight with it. How can it enter into the thought of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that the &s;oul, which is capable of &s;uch immen&s;e perfections, and of receiving new im|provements to all eternity, &s;hall fall away into nothing almo&s;t as &s;oon as it is created! are &s;uch abilities made for no purpo&s;e? A brute arrives at a point of perfection
<PB N="140" REF="029518_0071_0FE1CCD82EFC6D58">
that he can never pa&s;s: in a few years he has all the en|dowments he is capable of, and were he to live ten thou|&s;and more, would be the &s;ame thing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e is at pre&s;ent. Were a human &s;oul thus at a &s;tand in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s accompli&s;h|ments&mdash;were its faculties to be f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">blown, and capable of no farther enlargement, I would imagine it might fall away in&s;en&s;ibly, and drop at once into a &s;tate of annihil|ation. But can we believe a thinking being, that is in a perpetual progre&s;s of improvement, and travelling on from perfection to perfection, after having ju&s;t looked abroad into the works of its Creator, and made a few di&s;coveries of his infinite goodne&s;s, wi&s;dom, and power, mu&s;t peri&s;h at its fir&s;t &s;etting out, and in the very be|ginning of its inquiries?</P>
<P>A man, con&s;idered in his pre&s;ent &s;tate, &s;eems only &s;ent into the world to propagate his kind. He provides him|&s;elf with a &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and immediately quits his po&s;t to make room for him. He does not &s;eem born to enjoy life, but to deliver it down to others. This is not &s;ur|pri&s;ing to con&s;ider in animals which are formed for our u&s;e, and can fini&s;h their bu&s;ine&s;s in a &s;hort life. The &s;ilk-worm after having &s;pun her ta&s;k, lays her eggs, and dies. But a man can never have taken his full mea&s;ure of knowledge; has not time to &s;ubdue his pa&s;&s;ions, e&s;tab|li&s;h his &s;oul in virtue, and come up to the perfection of his nature, before he is hurried off the &s;tage. Would an infinitely wi&s;e being make &s;uch glorious creatures for &s;o mean a purpo&s;e? Can be delight in the production of &s;uch abortive intelligencies, &s;uch &s;hort-lived rea&s;onable beings? Would he give us talents that are not to be ex|erted? Capacities that are not to be gratified? How can we find that wi&s;dom, which &s;hines through all his works, in the formation of man, without looking on this world as only a nur&s;ery for the next, and believing that the &s;everal generations of rational creatures, which ri&s;e up and di&s;appear in &s;uch quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ions, are only to re|ceive their fir&s;t rudiments of exi&s;tence here, and after|wards to be tran&s;planted into a more friendly climate, where they may &s;pread and flouri&s;h to all eternity?</P>
<P>There is not, in my opinion, a more plea&s;ing and tri|umphant con&s;ideration in religion, than this of the per|petual progre&s;s which the &s;oul makes towards the per|fection of its nature, without ever arriving at a period in
<PB N="141" REF="029518_0071_0FE1CCD82EFC6D58">
it. To look upon the &s;oul as going on from &s;trength to &s;trength; to con&s;ider that it is to &s;hine for ever with new acce&s;&s;ions of glory, and brighten to all eternity; that it will &s;till be adding virtue to virtue, and knowl|edge to knowledge; carries in it &s;omething wonderfully agreeable to that ambition which is natural to the mind of man. Nay, it mu&s;t be a pro&s;pect plea&s;ing to God him&s;elf, to &s;ee his creation for ever beautifying in his eyes, and drawing nearer to him by greater degrees of re&s;emblance.</P>
<P>Methinks this &s;ingle con&s;ideration of the progre&s;s of a finite &s;pirit to perfection, will be &s;ufficient to extingui&s;h all envy in inferior nature, and all contempt in &s;uperior. That cherubim which now appears as a God to a human &s;oul, knows very well that the period will come about in eternity, when the human &s;oul will be as perfect as he him&s;elf now is; nay, when it &s;hall look down upon that degree of perfection as much as it now falls &s;hort of it. It is true, the higher nature &s;till advances, he by that means pre&s;erves the di&s;tance and &s;uperiority in the &s;cale of beings; but he knows, how high &s;oever the &s;tation is of which he &s;tands po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at pre&s;ent, the inferior nature will at length mount up to it, and &s;hine forth in the &s;ame degree of glory.</P>
<P>With what a&s;toni&s;hment and veneration may we look into our own &s;ouls, where there are &s;uch hidden &s;tores of virtue and knowledge, &s;uch inexhau&s;ted &s;ources of per|fection! we know not yet what we &s;hall be; nor will it ever enter into the heart of man to conceive the glory that will be always in re&s;erve for him. The &s;oul, con&s;id|ered with its Creator, is like one of tho&s;e mathematical lines that may draw nearer to one another to all eternity, without a po&s;&s;ibility of touching it: and can there be a thought &s;o tran&s;porting, as to con&s;ider our&s;elves in the&s;e perpetual approaches to him, who is not only the &s;tandard of perfection, but of happine&s;s?</P>

<P>IN a late conver&s;ation among &s;ome of the great and the wi&s;e, <HI>Theron,</HI> a man of wealth and figure, but unac|quainted with the philo&s;ophic &s;cience, &s;at in the mid&s;t of his friends of both &s;exes in a &s;tately room, with rich variety of furniture. <HI>Theron</HI> complained, that he had often heard it &s;aid <HI>how much we were all indebted to the country and the plough:</HI> but, for his part, he knew no obligation that we had to that low rank of mankind, who&s;e life is taken up in the fields, the woods, and the meadows; but that they paid their rents well, that the gentlemen might live at their ea&s;e. <HI>Crito</HI> was plea&s;ed to &s;eize the occa&s;ion, and entertained the gay audience with a &s;urpri&s;ing lecture of philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>"Permit me, <HI>Theron,</HI> &s;aid he, to be an advocate for the pea&s;ant, and I can draw up a long account of particulars for which you are indebted to the field and the fore&s;t, and to the men that cultivate the ground, and are engaged in rural bu&s;ine&s;s. Look around you on all the furniture of the room, &s;urvey your own clothing, ca&s;t your eyes on all the &s;plendid array of <HI>Therina</HI> and <HI>Per&s;is,</HI> and the other ladies near them, and you will find, that, except a few glittering &s;tones, and a little gold and &s;ilver which were dug out of the bowels of the earth, you can &s;carce &s;ee any thing that was not once growing green upon the ground, through the various labours of the planter and the ploughman. Whence came the floor you tread on, part where of is inlaid with wood of different colours? Whence the&s;e fair pannels of wain&s;cot, and the cornice that encompa&s;&s;es and adorns the room? Whence this lofty room of cedar, and the carved ornaments of it? Are they not all the &s;poils of the trees of the fore&s;t? Were not the&s;e once the verdant &s;tandard of the grove or mountain? What are your hangings of gay tape&s;try? Are they not owing to the fleece of the &s;heep, which borrowed their nouri&s;hment from the gra&s;s of the mead|ows? Thus the finery of your parlour once was gra&s;s: and &s;hould you favour me with a turn into your bed-cham|ber, I could &s;hew that the curtains, and the linen, and
<PB N="143" REF="029518_0072_0FE1CCD9D1338C98">
co&s;tly coverings, where you take your nightly repo&s;e, were &s;ome years ago all growing in the fields.</P>
<P>But I need not retire from the place where we are &s;eat|ed, to give you abundant di&s;coveries of this truth: is not the hair of camels a part of the materials which compo&s;e tho&s;e rich curtains which hang down by the windows, and the ea&s;y chairs which accommodate your friends? And if you think a little, you will find that camels, with their hair, were made of gra&s;s, as well as the &s;heep with their wool. What are the books that lie in the window, and the little implements of paper and wax, pens, and wafers, which I pre&s;ume may be found in the e&s;crutore? They have all the &s;ame original; they were once more vegetables. Paper and books owe their being to the tatters of linen which were woven of the threads of flax, or hemp. The pa&s;teboard covers are compo&s;ed of paper, and the leather is the &s;kin of the calf, that drew its life and &s;u&s;tenance from the meadows. The pen that you write with was plucked from the wing of the goo&s;e, which lived upon the gra&s;s of the common: the inkhorn was borrowed from the front of the grazing ox: the wafer is made of the pa&s;te of bread-corn; and the wax is originally plun|dered from the bee, who &s;tole it out of a thou&s;and flowers.</P>
<P>Permit me, ladies, &s;aid the philo&s;opher, to mention your dre&s;s; too nice a &s;ubject indeed for a &s;cholar to pretend any &s;kill in: but I per&s;uade my&s;elf your candour will not re&s;ent my naming the rich materials, &s;ince I leave tho&s;e more important points, the fa&s;hion and the air, to be decided entirely by your &s;uperior &s;kill. Shall I inquire, then, who gave <HI>Per&s;is</HI> the &s;ilken habit which &s;he wears? Did &s;he not borrow it from the worm that &s;pun tho&s;e &s;hining threads? And whence did the worm borrow it? From the leaves of the Mulberry-tree, which was planted and nouri&s;hed for this purpo&s;e by the country &s;wain. May I a&s;k again, How came <HI>Therina</HI> by the fine linen which &s;he is plea&s;ed to appear in, and the co&s;tly lace of <HI>Flanders</HI> that &s;urrounds it? Was it not made of the &s;talks of flax that grew up in the field like other vegetables? And are not the fine&s;t of your mu&s;lins owing to the <HI>Indian</HI> cotton-tree? Nor can you tell me, <HI>Theron,</HI> one upper garment you have, whether co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, cloak, or night gown, from your &s;houlders to your very feet, as rich and as new as you think it, which the &s;heep, or the poor &s;ilk-worm has not
<PB N="144" REF="029518_0073_0FE1CCDB6CDBEEB8">
worn before you. It is certain the beaver bore your hat upon his &s;kin; that &s;oft fur was his covering before it was yours: and the materials of your very &s;hoes, both the upper part and the &s;oles of them, cover the calf of the heifer before they were put on your feet: all this was gra&s;s at fir&s;t; for we have &s;een that all the animal world owes its being to vegetables.</P>
<P>Give me leave, Madam, &s;aid he to <HI>Therina,</HI> without offence, to lead you into further wonder. You have &s;een that the furniture of the place where we are, as well as precious attire in which you are dre&s;&s;ed, were lately the production, and the ornament of the fore&s;t, the meadow, or the garden. But could you forgive me, if I &s;hould attempt to per&s;uade you, that this beautiful body of yours, tho&s;e lovely limbs, were once growing al&s;o in the fields and meadows? I &s;ee, Ladies, you are a little &s;hock|ed and &s;urpri&s;ed at the thought. I confe&s;s the idea and &s;entiments of philo&s;ophy are not always &s;o courtly and &s;o favourable to huma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> nature, as to be addre&s;&s;ed to the tender &s;ex: but pardon me, <HI>Therina,</HI> if I inquire, Was not your infancy nur&s;ed with milk and bread-corn? Have you not been fed with wheat, though it was of the fine&s;t kind? And your drink, what has it been, but either the infu&s;ion of barley, or the juice of the grape? Or, for variety, perhaps the cyder grove has &s;upplied you. The fle&s;h with which you have been nouri&s;hed to &s;uch a well proportioned &s;tature, belonged to four footed animals, or to the fowls of the air; and each of the&s;e have been either fed with corn or gra&s;s. Whence then, Madam, has your body been &s;upported, and what do you think it is made of?</P>
<P>But it is &s;afer to transfer the argument to my&s;elf. The&s;e limbs of mine, <HI>Therina,</HI> owe them&s;elves entirely to the animal and vegetable food, to the roots, or the &s;talks, or the leaves, or the fruit of plants, or the fle&s;h of the brute creatures, which have pa&s;&s;ed through my mouth for the&s;e fifty years, or the mouth of my parents before me. This hand would have been worn to a mere &s;kele|ton, my arms had been dry bones, and my trunk and ribs the &s;tatue of death, had they not all received per|petual recruits from the field. The&s;e lips which now addre&s;s you, are of the &s;ame materials, and they were once growing like the gra&s;s on the earth. This very
<PB N="145" REF="029518_0073_0FE1CCDB6CDBEEB8">
fle&s;h, which I call mine now, did belong to the &s;heep or the ox before it was part of me; and it &s;erved to clothe tho&s;e bones before it covered mine. You know, <HI>Theron,</HI> you are a gentleman who delight in rural &s;ports, when you re&s;ide at your country &s;eat, and you love to fea&s;t on the game that you have pur&s;ued. Did you ever &s;uppo&s;e that any part of your&s;elf was once hurried through the air in the brea&s;t of a frightened partridge, which came before night into your net? Or that any piece of you was driven through the fields before the full-mouthed hounds on the legs of a hunted hare, which was the next day prepared for your table? Had you ever &s;o &s;trange a thought as this? And can you believe it now? Or, upon a &s;urvey of that argument, can you tell how to deny it? And what are hares and partridges made of, but growing herbage, or &s;hattered corn?</P>
<P>It is true, you have &s;ometimes ta&s;ted fi&s;h, either from the &s;ea or rivers, but even tho&s;e in their original are al&s;o &s;orts of gra&s;s; they have been fed partly by &s;ea-weeds, and partly by le&s;&s;er fi&s;h, which they have devoured, who&s;e prime and natural nouri&s;hment was from &s;ome vegetable matter in the watery world. In &s;hort, Sir, I am free to declare, that whether I have eaten chee&s;e or butter, bread or milk, whether I have fed on the ox or the &s;heep, or the fowls of the air, I am certain that this body, and the&s;e limbs of mine, even to my teeth and nails, and the hairs of my head, are all borrowed origin|ally from the vegetable creation. Every thing of me that is not a <HI>thinking power,</HI> that is not <HI>mind,</HI> or <HI>&s;pirit,</HI> was once growing like gra&s;s on the ground, or was made of the roots which &s;upported &s;ome green herbage.</P>
<P>And now, <HI>Theron,</HI> What do you think of all the&s;e para|doxes? Which of them do you cavil at? Which leaves you room for doubt or que&s;tion? Is not philo&s;ophy an entertaining &s;tudy, that teaches us our original, and the a&s;toni&s;hing operations of divine Wi&s;dom and Providence? But it teaches us al&s;o to have humble thoughts of our|&s;elves, and to remember from whence we came. <HI>Theron,</HI> to conclude the di&s;cour&s;e, confe&s;&s;ed his &s;urprize and conviction; he acknowledged the ju&s;tice of <HI>Crito'</HI>s whole argument, gave him hearty thanks for his in&s;tructive lecture, and re&s;olved to remember tho&s;e amazing &s;cenes of the operations of nature, and the adorable wi&s;dom of
<PB N="146" REF="029518_0074_0FE1CCE8CC2AF998">
God his Maker. Nor &s;hall I ever forget, &s;aid he, the &s;trange and unexpected dependence of man on all the meaner parts of the creation. I am convinced, that <HI>pride was never made for man,</HI> when I &s;ee how much a-kin his body is to the fowls of the air and brutes of the earth. And I think, &s;aid he, I am more indebted to my tenants than ever I could have imagined; nor will I ca&s;t &s;uch a &s;cornful eye again on the grazier and the farmer, &s;ince this fle&s;h and blood of mine, as well as the furniture of my hou&s;e, and the clothes I wear, were once growing in the fields or woods, under their care and cultivation; and I find I am nearer a-kin to them, &s;ince this &s;elf of mine, with all the finery that covers it, was made origin|ally of the &s;ame materials with them and their coar&s;er coverings.</P>

<P>ALEWD young fellow &s;eeing an aged Hermit go by him barefooted, <HI>Father,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>you are in a very mi&s;erable condition, if there is not another world. True, &s;on,</HI> &s;aid the Hermit, <HI>but what is thy condition if there is?</HI> Man is a creature de&s;igned for two different &s;tates of being, or rather for two different lives. His fir&s;t life is &s;hort and tran&s;ient; his &s;econd permanent and la&s;ting. The que&s;|tion we are all concerned in is this. In which of the&s;e two lives is it our chief intere&s;t to make our&s;elves happy? Or, in other words, whether we &s;hould endeavour to &s;e|cure to our&s;elves the plea&s;ures and gratifications of a life which is uncertain and precarious, and at its ut|mo&s;t length of a very incon&s;iderable duration; or &s;ecure to our&s;elves the plea&s;ures of a life which is fixed and &s;ettled, and will never end? Every man, upon the fir&s;t hearing of this que&s;tion, knows very well which &s;ide of it he ought to clo&s;e with. But, however right we are in theory, it is plain that in practice we adhere to the wrong &s;ide of the que&s;tion. We make provi&s;ion for this life, as
<PB N="147" REF="029518_0074_0FE1CCE8CC2AF998">
though it were never to have an end; and for the other life, as though it were never to have a beginning.</P>
<P>Should a &s;pirit of &s;uperior rank, who is a &s;tranger to human nature, accidentally alight upon the earth, and take a new &s;urvey of its inhabitants; what would his notions of us be? Would not he think that we are a &s;pecies of beings made for quite different ends and pur|po&s;es than what we really are; mu&s;t not he imagine, that we are placed in this world to get riches and honours? Would not he think that it was our duty to toil after wealth, and &s;tation, and title? Nay, would not he be|lieve we are forbidden poverty by threats of eternal pun|i&s;hment, and enjoined to pur&s;ue our plea&s;ures under pain of damnation? He would certainly imagine, that we are influenced by a &s;cheme of duties quite oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e which are indeed pre&s;cribed to us. And truly, according to &s;uch an imagination, he mu&s;t conclude, that we are a &s;pecies of mo&s;t obedient creatures in the univer&s;e; that we are con&s;tant to our duty; and that we keep a &s;teady eye on the end for which we were &s;ent hither.</P>
<P>But how great would be his a&s;toni&s;hment, when he learned that we were beings not de&s;igned to exi&s;t in this world above thre &s;core and ten years; and that the greate&s;t part of this bu&s;y &s;pecies fall &s;hort even of that age? How would he be lo&s;t in horror and admiration, when he &s;hould know that this &s;et of creatures, who lay out all their endeavours for this life, which &s;carce de|&s;erves the name of exi&s;tence; when, I &s;ay, he &s;hould know that this &s;et of creatures are to exi&s;t to all eternity in another life for which they make no preparations? Nothing can be a greater di&s;grace to rea&s;on, than that men, who are per&s;uaded of the&s;e two different &s;tates of being, &s;hould be perpetually employed in providing for a life of three&s;core and ten years, and neglecting to make provi&s;ion for that which, after many myriads of years, will be &s;till new, and &s;till in its beginning, e&s;pecially when we con&s;ider that our endeavours for making our|&s;elves great, rich, or honourable, or whatever el&s;e we place our happine&s;s in, may after all prove un&s;ucce&s;sful; whereas, if we con&s;tantly and &s;incerely endeavour to make our&s;elves happy in the other life, we are &s;ure that our endeavours will &s;ucceed, and that we &s;hall not be di&s;appointed of our hope.</P>

The following que&s;tion is &s;tarted by one of the &s;chool|men:&mdash;Suppo&s;ing the whole body of the earth were a great ball or ma&s;s of the fine&s;t &s;and, and that a &s;ingle grain or particle of this &s;and &s;hould be annihilated every thou&s;and years. Suppo&s;ing then that you had it in your choice to be happy all the while this prodigious ma&s;s of &s;and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s con&s;uming by this &s;low method, till there was no grain of it left, on condition you were to be mi&s;erable ever after, or &s;uppo&s;ing that you might be happy for ever after; on condition you &s;hould be mi&s;erable till the whole ma&s;s of &s;and were thus annihilated at the rate of one grain in a thou&s;and years: which of the&s;e two ca&s;es would you make your choice?</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, in this ca&s;e, &s;o many thou&s;ands of years are to the imagination as a kind of eternity, though in reality they do not bear &s;o great a proportion to that duration which is to follow them, as an unit does to the greate&s;t number which you can put together in figures, or as one of tho&s;e grains of &s;and to the &s;uppo&s;ed heap. Rea&s;on, therefore tells us, without any manner of he&s;itation, which would be the better part in this choice. However, as I have before intimated, our rea&s;on might in &s;uch a ca&s;e be &s;o over&s;et by the imagination, as to di&s;po&s;e &s;ome per&s;ons to &s;ink under the con&s;ideration of the great length of the fir&s;t part of this duration, and of the great di&s;tance of that &s;econd duration which is to &s;ucceed it. The mind, I &s;ay, might give it&s;elf to that happine&s;s which is at hand, con&s;idering that it is &s;o very near, and that it would la&s;t &s;o very long. But when the choice we actually have before us is this, Whether we will chu&s;e to be happy for the &s;pace of only three&s;core and ten, nay perhaps of only twenty or ten years, I might &s;ay of only a day or an hour, and mi&s;erable to all eterni|ty; or, on the contrary, mi&s;erable for this &s;hort term of years, and happy for a whole eternity? What words are &s;ufficient to expre&s;s that folly and want of con&s;ideration, which in &s;uch a ca&s;e would make a wrong choice!</P>
<P>I here put a ca&s;e even at the wor&s;t, by &s;uppo&s;ing (what &s;eldom happens) that a cour&s;e of virtue makes us mi&s;erable in this life: but if we &s;uppo&s;e (as it generally happens) that virtue would make us more happy, even in this life, than a contrary cour&s;e of vice, how can we &s;ufficiently condemn the &s;tupidity or madne&s;s of tho&s;e
<PB N="149" REF="029518_0075_0FE1CCEAC2AE2070">
per&s;ons who are capable of making &s;o ab&s;urd a choice?</P>
<P>Every wi&s;e man therefore will con&s;ider this life only as it may conduce to the happine&s;s of the other, and cheer|fully &s;acrifice the plea&s;ures of a few years to tho&s;e of an eternity.</P>

<P>IT is a celebrated thought of <HI>Socrates,</HI> That if all the misfortunes of mankind were ca&s;t into a public &s;tock, in order to be equally di&s;tributed among the whole &s;pe|cies, tho&s;e who now think them&s;elves the mo&s;t unhappy, would prefer the &s;hare they are already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, be|fore that which would fall to them by &s;uch a proper divi&s;ion. <HI>Horace</HI> has carried this thought a great deal further; which implies, that the hard&s;hips or misfor|tunes we lie under, are more ea&s;y to us than tho&s;e of any other per&s;on would be, in ca&s;e we &s;hould change conditions with him.</P>
<P>As I was ruminating on the&s;e two remarks, and &s;eated in my elbow chair, I in&s;en&s;ibly fell a&s;leep; when, on a &s;udden, me thought there was a proclamation made by <HI>Jupiter,</HI> that every mortal &s;hould bring in his griefs and calamities, and throw them together in a heap. There was a large plain appointed for this purpo&s;e. I took my &s;tand in the centre of it, and &s;aw with a great deal of plea&s;ure the whole human &s;pecies marching one after another, and throwing down their &s;everal loads, which immediately grew up into a prodigious mountain, that &s;eemed to ri&s;e above the clouds.</P>
<P>There was a certain lady, of a thin airy &s;hape, who was very active in this &s;olemnity. She carried a magnifying gla&s;s in one of her hands, and was clothed in a loo&s;e flowing robe embroidered with &s;everal figures of fiends and &s;pectres, that di&s;covered them&s;elves in a thou&s;and chimerical &s;hapes, as her garment hovered in the wind. There was &s;omething wild and di&s;tracted in her looks. Her name was <HI>Fancy.</HI> She led up every mortal to the appointed place, after having very officiou&s;ly a&s;&s;i&s;ted him
<PB N="150" REF="029518_0076_0FE1CCEC5FE0B0B8">
in making up his pack, and laying it upon his &s;houlders. My heart melted within me to &s;ee my fellow creatures groaning under their re&s;pective burdens, and to con&s;ider that prodigious bulk of human calamities which lay before me.</P>
<P>There were, however, &s;everal per&s;ons who gave, me great diver&s;ion upon this occa&s;ion. I ob&s;erved one bringing in a fardel very carefully concealed under an old embroidered cloak, which, upon his throwing it up|on the heap, I di&s;covered it to be Poverty. Another, after a great deal of puffing, threw down his luggage; which, upon examining, I found to be his wife.</P>
<P>There were multitudes of lovers &s;addled with very whim&s;ical burdens, compo&s;ed of darts and flames; but what was very odd, though they &s;ighed as if their heart would break under the&s;e bundles of calamities, they could not per&s;uade them&s;elves to ca&s;t them into the heap when they came up to it; but after a few faint efforts &s;hook their heads, and marched away as heavy loaded as they came. I &s;aw multitudes of old women throw down wrinkles, and &s;everal young ones who &s;tripped them&s;elves of a tawny &s;kin. There were very great heaps of red no&s;es, large lips, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ty teeth. The truth of it is, I was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee the greate&s;t part of the mountain made up of bodily deformities. Ob&s;erv|ing one advance towards the heap with a larger cargo than ordinary upon his back, I found upon his nearer approach, that it was only a natural hump, which he di&s;po&s;ed of with great joy of heart among this collection of human mi&s;eries. There were likewi&s;e di&s;tempers of all &s;orts, though I could not but ob&s;erve that there were many more imaginary than real. One little packet I could not but take notice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, which was a complication of all the di&s;ea&s;es incident to human nature, and was in the hand of a great many fine people: this was called the Spleen. But what mo&s;t of all &s;urpri&s;ed me, was a remark I made, that there was not a &s;ingle vice or folly thrown into the whole heap: at which I was very much a&s;toni&s;hed, having concluded within my&s;elf, that every one would take this opportunity of getting rid of his pa&s;&s;ions, prejudices, and frailties.</P>
<P>I took notice in particular of a very profligate fellow, who I did not que&s;tion came loaded with his crimes;
<PB N="151" REF="029518_0076_0FE1CCEC5FE0B0B8">
but upon &s;earching into his bundle, I found, that in&s;tead of throwing his guilt from him, he had only laid down his memory. He was followed by another worthle&s;s rogue, who flung away his mode&s;ty in&s;tead of his ignorance.</P>
<P>When the whole race of mankind had thus ca&s;t down their burdens, the <HI>Phantom,</HI> which had been &s;o bu&s;y on this occa&s;ion, &s;eeing me an idle &s;pectator of what pa&s;&s;ed, approached towards me. I grew unea&s;y at her pre&s;ence, when on a &s;udden &s;he held her magnifying gla&s;s full before mine eyes. I no &s;ooner &s;aw my face in it, but was &s;tartled at the &s;hortne&s;s of it, which now appeared to me in the utmo&s;t aggravation. The immoderate breadth of the features made me very much out of humour with my own countenance, upon which I threw it from me like a ma&s;k. It happened very luckily that one who &s;tood by me had ju&s;t before thrown down his vi&s;age, which it &s;eems was too long for him. It was indeed extended to a mo&s;t &s;hameful length: I believe the very chin was, (mode&s;tly &s;peaking) as long as my whole face. We had both of us an opportunity of mending our&s;elves; and all the contri|butions being now brought in, every man was at liberty to change his misfortunes for tho&s;e of another per&s;on. But as there aro&s;e many new incidents in the &s;equel of my vi&s;ion, I &s;hall re&s;erve them for the &s;ubject of my next paper.</P>

<P>IN my la&s;t paper, I gave my readers a &s;ight of that mountain of mi&s;eries which was made up of tho&s;e &s;everal calamities that afflict the minds of men: I &s;aw, with un&s;peakable plea&s;ure, the whole &s;pecies thus delivered from its &s;orrows; though, at the &s;ame time, as we &s;tood round the heap, and &s;urveyed the &s;everal materials of which it was compo&s;ed, there was &s;carce a mortal, in this va&s;t multitude, who did not di&s;cover what he thought plea&s;ures and ble&s;&s;ings of life; and wondered how the owners of them ever came to look upon them as burdens and griev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nces.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="029518_0077_0FE1CCEDFB75FC20">
As we were regarding very attentively this confu&s;ion of mi&s;eries, this chaos of calamity, <HI>Jupiter</HI> i&s;&s;ued out a &s;econd proclamation, that every one was now at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">erty to change his affliction, and to return to his habitation with any other &s;uch bundle as &s;hould be delivered to him.</P>
<P>Upon this, <HI>Fancy</HI> began to be&s;tir her&s;elf, and parcelling up the whole heap with incredible activity, recommended to every one his particular packet. The hurry and con|fu&s;ion at this time was not to be expre&s;&s;ed. Some ob&s;er|vations which I made upon this occa&s;ion I &s;hall communi|cate to the public. A venerable grey-headed man, who had laid down the cholic, and who I found wanted in heir to his e&s;tate, &s;natched up an undutiful &s;on, that had been thrown into the heap by an angry father.&mdash;The gracele&s;s youth, in le&s;s than a quarter of an hour, pulled the old gentleman by the beard, and had like to have knocked his brains out; &s;o that meeting the true father, who came towards him in a fit of the gripes, he begged him to take his &s;on again, and give him back his chon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">; but they were incapable either of them to recede from the choice they had made. A poor galley-&s;lave, who had thrown down his chains, took up the gout in their &s;tead; but made &s;uch wry faces, that one might ea&s;ily perceive he was no great gainer by the bargain. It was plea&s;ant enough to &s;ee the &s;everal exchanges that were made for &s;ickne&s;s again&s;t poverty, hunger again&s;t want of appetite, and care again&s;t pain.</P>
<P>The female world were very bu&s;y among them&s;elves in bartering for features: one was trucking a lock of grey hairs for a carbuncle; another was making over a &s;hort wai&s;t for a pair of round &s;houlders, and a third cheapening a bad face for a lo&s;t reputation: but on all the&s;e occa&s;ions, there was not one of them who did not think the new blemi&s;h, as &s;oon as &s;he had got it into her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion much more di&s;agreeable than the old one. I made the &s;ame ob&s;ervation on every other misfortune or calamity, which every one in the a&s;&s;embly brought upon him&s;elf, in lies of what he had parted with: whether it be that all the evils which befall us are in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;uited and propor|tioned to our &s;trength, or that every ill becomes more &s;upportable by our being accu&s;tomed to it, I &s;hall not determine.</P>
<P>I could not from my heart forbear pitying the poor
<PB N="153" REF="029518_0077_0FE1CCEDFB75FC20">
humpbacked gentleman mentioned in the former paper, who went off a very well-&s;haped per&s;on with a &s;tone in his bladde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">; nor the fine gentleman who had &s;truck up a bargain with him that limped through the whole a&s;&s;embly of ladies, who u&s;ed to admire him, with a pair of &s;houlders peeping over his head.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not omit my own particular adventure. My friend with the long vi&s;age had no &s;ooner taken upon him my &s;hort face, but he made &s;uch a grote&s;que figure in it, that as I looked upon him I could not forbear laughing at my&s;elf, in&s;omuch that I put my own face out of coun|tenance. The poor gentleman was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the ridicule, that I found he was a&s;hamed of what he had done: on the other &s;ide, I found that I my&s;elf had got no great rea&s;on to triumph; for as I went to touch my fore|head, I mi&s;&s;ed the place, and clapped my finger on my upper lip. Be&s;ides, as my no&s;e was exceeding prominent, I gave it two or three unlucky knocks, as I was playing my hand about my face, and aiming at &s;ome other part of it. I &s;aw two other gentlemen by me, who were in the &s;ame ridiculous circum&s;tances. The&s;e had made a fooli&s;h &s;wap between a couple of thick bandy legs, and two long trap-&s;ticks that had no calves to them. One of the&s;e looked like a man walking upon &s;tilts, and was &s;o lifted up in the air above his ordinary height, that his head turned round with it; while the other made &s;uch auk-ward circles as he attempted to walk, that he &s;carce knew how to move forward upon his new &s;upporters. Ob&s;erv|ing him to be a very plea&s;ant kind of a fellow, I &s;tuck my cane into the ground, and told him I would lay him a bottle of wine that he did not march up to it on a line, that I drew for him, in a quarter of an hour.</P>
<P>The heap was at la&s;t di&s;tributed among the two &s;exes, who made a mo&s;t piteous &s;ight, as they wandered up and down under the pre&s;&s;ure of their &s;everal burdens. The whole plain was filled with murmurs and complaints, groans and lamentations. <HI>Jupiter</HI> at length, taking com|pa&s;&s;ion upon the poor mortals, ordered them a &s;econd time to lay down their loads, with a de&s;ign to give every one his own again. They di&s;charged them with a great deal of plea&s;ure; after which the <HI>Phantom,</HI> which had led them into &s;uch gro&s;s delu&s;ion, was commanded to di&s;ap|pear. There was &s;ent in her &s;tead a godde&s;s of a quite
<PB N="154" REF="029518_0078_0FE1CCFA227380F8">
different figure: Her motions were &s;teady and compo&s;ed, and her a&s;pect &s;erious and cheerful. She every now and then ca&s;t her eyes towards heaven, and fixed them upon <HI>Jupiter.</HI> Her name was <HI>Patience.</HI> She had no &s;ooner, placed her&s;elf by the Mount of Sorrows, but, what I thought very remarkable, the whole heap &s;unk to &s;uch a degree, that it did not appear a third part &s;o big as it was before. She after wards returned every man his own proper calamity, and teaching him how to bear it in the mo&s;t commodious manner, he marched off with it con|tentedly, being very well plea&s;ed that he had not been left to his own choice as to the kind of evils which fell to his lot.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the &s;everal pieces of morality to be drawn out of this vi&s;ion, I learnt from it, never to repine at my own misfortunes, or to envy the happine&s;s of another, &s;ince it is impo&s;&s;ible for any man to form a right judgment of his neighbour's &s;ufferings; for which rea&s;on al&s;o I have determined never to think too lightly of another's complaints, but to regard the &s;orrows of my fellow-crea|tures with &s;entiments of humanity and compa&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>"As I was &s;itting once at the porch of the temple, pen&s;ive and alone, mine eyes wandered among the mul|titude that was &s;cattered before me; and while-I remark|ed the warine&s;s and &s;olicitude which was vi&s;ible in every countenance, I was &s;uddenly &s;truck with a &s;en&s;e of their condition.

<P>"While my thoughts thus multiplied, and my heart burnt within me, I became &s;en&s;ible of a &s;udden influ|ence from above. The &s;treets and the crowds of <HI>Mecca</HI> di&s;appeared. I found my&s;elf &s;itting on the declivity of a mountain, and perceived at my right hand an angel, whom I knew to be <HI>Azoran,</HI> the mini&s;ter of reproof. When I &s;aw him I was afraid. I ca&s;t my eyes upon the ground, and was about to deprecate his anger, when he commanded me to be &s;ilent. <HI>"Almet,</HI> &s;aid he, thou ha&s;t devoted thy life to meditation, that thy coun&s;el might deliver ignorance from the mazes of error, and deter pre|&s;umption from the precipice of guilt; but the book of nature thou ha&s;t read without under&s;tanding: it is again open before thee; look up, con&s;ider it, and be wi&s;e."</P>
<P>"I looked up, and beheld an inclo&s;ure, beautiful as the gardens of paradi&s;e, but of a &s;mall extent. Through the middle there was a green walk; at the end a wild de&s;art; and beyond, impenetrable darkne&s;s. The walk was &s;haded with trees of every kind, that were covered at once with blo&s;&s;oms and fruit; innumerable birds were &s;inging in the branches; the gra&s;s was intermingled with flowers, which impregnated the breeze with fra|grance, and painted the path with beauty: on the one &s;ide flowed a gentle tran&s;parent &s;tream, which was ju&s;t heard to murmur over the golden &s;ands that &s;parkled at the bottom; and on the other were walks and bowers, fountains, grottos, and ca&s;cades, which diver&s;ified the &s;cene with endle&s;s variety, but did not conceal the bounds."</P>
<P>"While I was gazing in a tran&s;port of delight and wonder on this enchanting &s;pot, I perceived a man &s;teal|ing along the walk with a thoughtful and deliberate

pace: his eyes were fixed upon the earth, and his arms cro&s;&s;ed on his bo&s;om; he &s;ometimes &s;tarted as if a &s;ud|den pang had &s;eized him; his countenance expre&s;&s;ed &s;olicitude and terror: he looked round with a &s;igh, and having gazed a moment on the de&s;art that lay before him, he &s;eemed as if he wi&s;hed to &s;top, but was impelled forward by &s;ome in&s;en&s;ible power: his features, how|ever, &s;oon &s;ettled again into a calm melancholy; his eyes were again fixed on the ground, and he went on as before with apparent reluctance, but without emotion. I was &s;truck with this appearance; and turning ha&s;tily to the angel, was about to inquire what could produce &s;uch in|felicity in a being &s;urrounded with every object that could gratify every &s;en&s;e; but he prevented my reque&s;t: "The book of nature, &s;aid he, is before thee; look up, con&s;ider it and be wi&s;e." I looked, and beheld a valley between two mountains that were craggy and barren: on the path there was, no verdure, and the mountains afforded no &s;hade: the &s;un burnt in the zenith, and eve|ry &s;pring was dried up: but the valley terminated in a country that was plea&s;ant and fertile, &s;haded with woods, and adorned with buildings. At a &s;econd view, I di&s;|covered a man in this valley, meagre indeed and naked, but his countenance was cheerful, and his deportment active: he kept his eye fixed upon the country before him, and looked as if he would have run, but that he was re&s;trained, as the other had been impelled, by &s;ome &s;ecret influence: &s;ometimes, indeed, I perceived a &s;ud|den expre&s;&s;ion of pain, and &s;ometimes he &s;tepped &s;hort as if his foot was pierced by the a&s;perities of the way; but the &s;prightline&s;s of his countenance in&s;tantly return|ed, and he pa&s;&s;ed forward without appearance of repi|ning or complaint."</P>
<P>I turned again towards the angel, impatient to inquire from what &s;ecret &s;ource happine&s;s was derived, in a &s;itu|ation &s;o different from that in which it might have been expected? But he again prevented my reque&s;t: <HI>"Almet,</HI> &s;aid he, remember what thou ha&s;t &s;een, and let this me|morial be written upon the tablet of thine heart.

<P>GOING ye&s;terday to dine with an old acquaintance, I had the misfortune to find his whole family very much dejected. Upon a&s;king him the occa&s;ion of it, he told me that his wife had dreamt a very &s;trange dream the night before, which they were afraid portended &s;ome misfortune to them&s;elves or to their children. At her coming into the room I ob&s;erved a &s;ettled melancho|ly in her countenance, which I &s;hould have been troubled for, had I not heard from whence it proceeded. We were no &s;ooner &s;et down, but after having looked upon me a little while, "My dear, &s;ays &s;he, turning to her hu&s;band, you may now &s;ee the &s;tranger that was in the candle la&s;t night." Soon after this, as they began to talk of family affairs, a little boy at the other end of the table told her, that he was to go into joining hand on <HI>Thur&s;day: "Thur&s;day!</HI> &s;ays &s;he, no child, if it plea&s;e God, you &s;hall not begin upon <HI>Childer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">as-day;</HI> tell your writing-ma&s;ter that <HI>Friday</HI> will be &s;oon enough." I was reflecting within my&s;elf on the oddne&s;s of her fancy, and wondering that any body would e&s;tabli&s;h it as a rule to lo&s;e a day in every week. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e my mu|&s;ings, &s;he de&s;ired me to reach her a little &s;alt upon the point of my knife, which I did, in &s;uch a trepidation and hurry of obedience, that I let it drop by the way; at which &s;he immediately &s;tartled, and &s;aid it fell towards her.</P>
<P>Upon this I looked very black; and ob&s;erving the concern of the whole table, began to con&s;ider my&s;elf, with &s;ome confu&s;ion, as a per&s;on that had brought a di&s;|a&s;ter upon the family. The lady, however, recovering her&s;elf, after a little &s;pace, &s;aid to her hu&s;band, with a &s;igh, "My dear, misfortunes never come &s;ingle." My friend, I found, acted but an under part at his table, and being a man of more good nature than under&s;tanding, thinks him&s;elf obliged to fall in with all the pa&s;&s;ions and

humours of his yoke-fellow: "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o you remember, child, &s;aid &s;he, that the pigeon-hou&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ell the very afternoon that our carele&s;s wench &s;pilt the &s;alt upon the table!" "yes, &s;ays he, my dear, and the nex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">o&s;t brought us an account of the battle of <HI>Almanza."</HI> The reader may gue&s;s at the figure I made, after having done all this mi&s;chief. I di&s;patched my dinner as fa&s;t as I could, with my u&s;ual taciturnity; when, to my utter confu&s;ion, the lady &s;ee|ing me quitting my knife and fork, and laying them acro&s;s one another upon my plate, de&s;ired me that I would humour her &s;o far as to take them out of that fig|ure, and place them &s;ide by &s;ide. What the ab&s;urdity was which I had committed I did not know, but I &s;up|po&s;e there was &s;ome traditionary &s;uper&s;tition in it; and therefore, in obedience to the lady of the hou&s;e, I di&s;po|&s;ed of my knife and fork in two parallel lines, which is a figure I &s;hall always lay them in for the future, though I do not know any rea&s;on for it.</P>
<P>It is not difficult for a man to &s;ee that a per&s;on has conceived an aver&s;ion to him. For my own part, I quickly found, by the lady's looks, that &s;he regarded me as a very odd kind of a fellow, with an unfortunate a&s;|pect: for which rea&s;on I took my leave immediately after dinner, and withdrew to my own lodgings. Upon my return home, I fell into a profound contemplation on the evils that attend tho&s;e &s;uper&s;titious follies of man|kind; how they &s;ubject us to imaginary afflictions, and additional &s;orrows, that do not properly come within our lot. As if the natural calamities of life were not &s;ufficient for it, we turn the mo&s;t indifferent circum&s;tan|ces into mi&s;fortunes, and &s;uffer as much from trifling accidents as from real evils. I have known the &s;hooting of a &s;tar &s;poil a night's re&s;t; and have &s;een a man in love grow pale and lo&s;e his appetite, upon the plucking of a merry thought. A &s;creech owl at midnight has alarmed a family more than a band of robbers; nay, the voice of a cricket has &s;truck more terror than the roar|ing of a lion. There is nothing &s;o incon&s;iderable, which may not appear dreadful to an imagination filled with omens and progno&s;tics. A ru&s;ty nail, or crooked pin, &s;hoots up into prodigies.</P>
<P>I remember I was once in a mixed a&s;&s;embly, that was full of noi&s;e and mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">, when on a &s;udden an old woman
<PB N="161" REF="029518_0081_0FE1CCFF0B1D4E70">
unluckily ob&s;erved there were thirteen of us in company. The remark &s;truck a panic of terror into &s;everal who were pre&s;ent, in&s;omuch that one or two of the ladies were going to leave the room; but a friend of mine taking notice that one of our female companions was big with child, affirmed there were fourteen in the room, and that in&s;tead of portending that one of the company &s;hould die, it plainly foretold that one of them &s;hould be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. Had not my friend found this experiment to break the omen, I que&s;tion not but half the women in the company would have fallen &s;ick that very night.</P>
<P>An old maid, that is troubled with the vapours, pro|duces infinite di&s;turbances of this kind among her friends and neighbours. I knew a maiden aunt of a great family, who is one of tho&s;e antiquated <HI>&s;ibyls,</HI> that forebodes and prophe&s;ies from one end of the year to the other. She is always &s;eeing apparitions, and hear|ing dead watches; and was the other day almo&s;t fright|ened out of her wits by the great hou&s;e-dog, that howled in the &s;table at the time when &s;he lay ill of the tooth-ach.</P>
<P>Such an extravagant ca&s;t of mind engages multitudes of people, not only in impertinent terror, but in &s;uper|numerary duties of life; and ari&s;es from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fear and ignorance which are natural to the &s;oul of man. The horror with which we entertain the thought<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of death, (or indeed of any future evil) and the uncertainty of its approach, fill a melancholy mind with innumerable ap|prehen&s;ions and &s;u&s;picions, and con&s;equently di&s;po&s;e it to the ob&s;ervation of &s;uch groundle&s;s prod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ies and pre|dictions. For, as it is the chief concern of wi&s;e men, to retrench the evils of life by the rea&s;onings of philo&s;ophy, it is the employment of fools to multiply them by the &s;entiments of &s;uper&s;tition.</P>
<P>For my own part, I &s;hould be very much troubled were I endowed with this divining quality, though it &s;hould inform me truly of every thing that can befal me: I would not anticipate the reli&s;h of any happine&s;s, nor feel the weight of any mi&s;ery, before it actually arrives.</P>
<P>I know but one way of fortifying my &s;oul again&s;t th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e gloomy pre&s;ages and terrors of mind; and that is, by &s;ecuring to my&s;elf the friend&s;hip and protection of that Being, who di&s;po&s;es of events, and governs futurity. He

<P>I REMEMBER la&s;t winter there were &s;everal young girls of the neighbourhood &s;itting about the fire with my landlady's daughters, and telling &s;tories of &s;pirits <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> apparitions. Upon my opening the door, the young women broke off their di&s;cour&s;e; but my landlady's daughter telling them that it was no body but the gen|tleman, (for that is the name I go by in the neighbour|hood, as well as in the family) they went on without minding me. I &s;eated my&s;elf by the candle that &s;tood on a table at one end of the room; and pretending to read a book that I took out of my pocket, heard &s;everal dreadful &s;tories of gho&s;ts as pale as-a&s;hes that had &s;tood at the foot of a be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> or walked over a church-yard by moon-light; and of others that had been conjured into the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> for di&s;turbing people's re&s;t, and drawing their curtains at midnight; with many other old women's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ables of the like nature. As one &s;pirit rai&s;ed another, I ob&s;erved that at the end of every &s;tory the whole com|pany clo&s;ed their ranks, and crowded about the fire. I took notice, in particular, of a little boy, who was &s;o at|tentive to every &s;tory, that I am mi&s;taken if he ventures to go to bed by him&s;elf the&s;e twelve months. Indeed they talked &s;o long, that the imaginations of the who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> a&s;&s;embly were manife&s;tly crazed, and I am &s;ure will be the wor&s;e for it as long as they live.

<PB N="163" REF="029518_0082_0FE1CD09ECB16FD0">
the company how long I had been in the room, and whether I did not look paler than I u&s;ed to do. This put me under &s;ome apprehen&s;ions that I &s;hould be forced to explain my&s;elf, if I did not retire; for which rea&s;on I took the candle in my hand, and went up into my cham|ber, not without wondering at this unaccountable weak|ne&s;s in rea&s;onable creatures, that they &s;hould love to a&s;toni&s;h and terrify one another. Were I a father, I &s;hould take particular care to pre&s;erve my children from the&s;e little horrors of imagination which they are apt to contract when they are young, and are not able to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ake off when they are in years. I have known a &s;oldier that has entered a breach, affrighted at his own &s;had|ow, and look pale at a little &s;cratching at his door, who the day before had marched up again&s;t a battery of can|non. There are in&s;tances of per&s;ons who have been ter|rified even to di&s;traction at the figure of a tree, or the &s;haking of a bull-ru&s;h.

<P>With the &s;ame kind of anxious veneration I have, for many years, been making ob&s;ervations on the life of <HI>Poly|philus,</HI> a man whom all his acquaintances have, from his fir&s;t appearance in the world, feared for the quickne&s;s of his di&s;cernment, and admired for the multiplicity of his attainments; but who&s;e progre&s;s in life, and who&s;e u&s;e|fulne&s;s to mankind, have perhaps been hindered by the &s;uperfluity of his knowledge, and the celerity of his mind.</P>
<P><HI>Polyphilus</HI> was remarkable at the &s;chool for &s;urpa&s;&s;ing all his companions, without any vi&s;ible application. And at the univer&s;ity was di&s;tingui&s;hed equally for his &s;ucce&s;sful progre&s;s, as well through the rough and thorny mazes of &s;cience, as the &s;mooth and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">wing parts of po|liter literature; without any &s;trict confinement to hours of &s;tudy, or any remarkable forbearance of the common amu&s;ements of young men.</P>
<P>When <HI>Polyphilus</HI> was at the age in which men u&s;ually chu&s;e their profe&s;&s;ion, and prepare to enter into a pub|lic character, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> eye was fixed upon him; and all were curious to inquire what this univer&s;al genius would fix upon for the employment of life: and no doubt was made but that he would leave all his cotem|poraries behind him; and mount to the highe&s;t honours of that cla&s;s in which he &s;hould enli&s;t him&s;elf, without tho&s;e delays and pau&s;es which mu&s;t always be endured by meaner abilities.</P>
<P><HI>Polyphilus,</HI> though by no means in&s;olent or a&s;&s;uming, had been &s;ufficiently encouraged by uninterrupted &s;uc|ce&s;s, to place great confidence in his own parts; and was not below his companions in the indulgence of his hopes, and expectations of the a&s;toni&s;hment with which the world would be &s;truck, when fir&s;t his lu&s;tre &s;hould break ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> upon it; nor could he help (for whom does not con&s;tant flattery intoxicate?) to join &s;ometimes in the mirth of his friends, at the &s;udden di&s;appearance of tho&s;e who, having &s;hone a while, and drawn the eyes of the public upon
<PB N="165" REF="029518_0083_0FE1CD0D1DD5B5E8">
their feeble lu&s;tre, were now doomed to fade away before him.</P>
<P>It is natural for a man to catch advantageous notions of the condition which tho&s;e with whom he conver&s;es, are &s;triving to attain. <HI>Polyphilus,</HI> in a ramble to <HI>London,</HI> fell accidentally among the phy&s;icians; and was &s;o much plea&s;ed with the pro&s;pect of turning philo&s;ophy to profit, and &s;o highly delighted with a new theory of fevers, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> into his imagination, and which, after having con|&s;idered in a few hours, he found him&s;elf able to maintain again&s;t all the advocates for the ancient &s;y&s;tem, that he re&s;olved to apply him&s;elf to anatomy, botany, and chym|i&s;try; and to leave no part unconquered, either of the animal, mineral, or vegetable kingdoms.</P>
<P>He therefore read authors, con&s;tructed &s;y&s;tems, and fried experiments. But unhappily, as he was going to &s;ee a new plant in flower at <HI>Chel&s;ea,</HI> he met, (in cro&s;&s;ing <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> to take the water,) the chancellor's coach. He had the curio&s;ity to follow him into the hall; where a remarkable cau&s;e happened to be tried; he found him&s;elf able to produce &s;o many arguments which the lawyers had omitted on both &s;ides, that he determined to quit phy&s;ic for a profe&s;&s;ion in which he found it would be &s;o ea&s;y to excel; and which promi&s;ed higher honors and larger profits, without melancholy attendance upon mi&s;ery, mean &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to peevi&s;hne&s;s, and continued interruption to re&s;t and plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>He immediately took chambers in the <HI>Temple,</HI> bought a common place book, and confined him&s;elf for &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to the peru&s;al of the &s;tatutes, year-books, plead|ings, and reports. He was a con&s;tant hoarer of the pro|ceedings in the courts, and began to put ca&s;es with rea&s;on|able accuracy.&mdash;But he &s;oon di&s;covered, by con&s;idering the fortune of lawyers, that preferment was not to be got by acutene&s;s, learning, and eloquence. He was perplex|ed by the ab&s;urdities of attornies, and mi&s;repre&s;entations made by his clients of their own cau&s;es; by the u&s;ele&s;s anxiety of one, and the ince&s;&s;ant importunity of another. He began to repent of having devoted him&s;elf to a &s;tudy, which was &s;o narrow in its comprehen&s;ion, which could never carry his name to any other country; and thought it unworthy of a man of parts, to &s;ell his life only for money. The barrenne&s;s of his fellow-&s;tudents forced
<PB N="166" REF="029518_0084_0FE1CD0EBB406560">
him generally into other company, at his hours of enter|tainment: and, among the varieties of conver&s;ation through which his curio&s;ity was daily wandering, he, by chance, mingled at a tavern with &s;ome intelligent officers of the army. A man of letters was ea&s;ily dazzled with the gaiety of their appearance, and &s;oftened into kindne&s;s by the politene&s;s of their addre&s;s. He therefore cultiva|ted this new acquaintance; and when he &s;aw how readi|ly they found, in every place, admi&s;&s;ion and regard, and how familiarly they mingled with every rank and order of men, he began to feel his heart beat for military hon|ours; and wondered how the prejudices of the univer&s;ity &s;hould have made him &s;o long in&s;en&s;ible of that ambition, which had fired &s;o many hearts in every age, and negli|gent of that calling, which is above all others, univer&s;ally and invariably illu&s;trious, and which gives, even to the exterior appearance of its profe&s;&s;ors, a dignity and free|dom unknown to the re&s;t of mankind.</P>
<P>The&s;e favourable impre&s;&s;ions were made &s;till deeper by his conver&s;ation with the ladies; who&s;e regard for &s;ol|diers he could not ob&s;erve without wi&s;hing him&s;elf one of that happy fraternity, to which the female world &s;eem to have devoted all their charms and their kindne&s;s. The love of knowledge, which was &s;till his predominant inclination, was gratified by the recital of adventures, and accounts of foreign countries; and therefore he thought there was no way of life in which all his views could &s;o completely concenter as in that of a &s;oldier. In the art of war, he thought it not difficult to excel, hav|ing ob&s;erved his new friends not very much ver&s;ed in the principles of tactics or fortification: and therefore he &s;tudied all the military writers, both ancient and modern; and in a &s;hort time, could tell how to have gained every remarkable battle that had been lo&s;t from the beginning of the world. He often &s;hewed at a table, how <HI>Alexander</HI> &s;hould have been checked in his conque&s;ts; what was the fatal error at <HI>Phar&s;alia;</HI> how <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Sweden</HI> might have e&s;caped his ruin at <HI>Poltowa,</HI> and how <HI>Marlborough</HI> might have been made to repent his temerity at <HI>Blenheim.</HI> He entrenched armies upon paper, &s;o that no &s;uperiority of numbers could force them; and modelled in clay ma|ny impregnable fortre&s;&s;es, on which the pre&s;ent arts of attack would be exhau&s;ted without effect.</P>

He &s;aw, that in&s;tead of conquering their fears, the endeavours of his gay friends were only to e&s;|cape them: but his philo&s;ophy chained his mind to its object; and rather loaded him with &s;hackles, than fur|ni&s;hed him with arms. He however &s;uppre&s;&s;ed his mi&s;e|ry in &s;ilence, and pa&s;&s;ed through the campaign with honour; but found him&s;elf utterly unable to &s;upport another.</P>
<P>He then had recour&s;e again to his books, and contin|ued to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ange from one &s;tudy to another. As I u&s;ually vi&s;it him once a month, and am admitted to him without previous notice, I have found him within this la&s;t half year decyphering the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> language, making a farce, collecting a vocabulary of the ob&s;olete terms of the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> law, writing an Inquiry concerning the ancient <HI>Corinthian</HI> bra&s;s, and forming a new &s;cheme of the varia|tions of the needle.</P>
<P>Thus his powerful genius which might have extended the &s;phere of any &s;cience, or benefited the world in any profe&s;&s;ion, is di&s;&s;ipated in a boundle&s;s variety, without any profit to others or to him&s;elf. He makes &s;udden irruptions into the regions of knowledge, and &s;ees all ob&s;tacles give way before him; but he never &s;tays long enough to complete his conque&s;t, to e&s;tabli&s;h laws, or bring away the &s;poils.</P>
<P>Such is often the folly of tho&s;e men, whom nature has enabled to obtain &s;kill and knowledge on terms &s;o ea&s;y, that they have no &s;en&s;e of the value of the acqui&s;ition; who are qualified to make &s;uch &s;peedy progre&s;s in learn|ing, that they think them&s;elves at liberty to loiter in the way: and often, by turning a&s;ide after every new object like <HI>Atalanta,</HI> lo&s;e the race to &s;lower competitors, who pre&s;s diligently forward, and who&s;e force is directed to a &s;ingle point.</P>
<P>I have often thought them happy that have been fixed,
<PB N="168" REF="029518_0085_0FE1BA1284FAEAE8">
from the fir&s;t dawn of thought, in a determination to &s;ome &s;tate of life, by the choice of one who&s;e authority may preclude caprice, and who&s;e influence may prejudice them in the favour of his opinion. The general precept of con&s;ulting the genius is of little u&s;e, unle&s;s we are told how the genius can be known. If it is to be di&s;cov|ered only by experiment, life will be lo&s;t before the re&s;o|lution can be fixed; if any other inclinations are to be found, they may perhaps be very early di&s;cerned. At lea&s;t, if to mi&s;carry in an attempt be a proof of having mi&s;taken the direction of the genius, men appear not le&s;s frequently deceived with regard to them&s;elves than to others: and therefore no one has much rea&s;on to com|plain that his life was planned out by friends; or to be confident that he &s;hould have had either more honor or happine&s;s, by being abandoned to the chance of his own fancy.</P>
<P>It was &s;aid of the learned <HI>Sander&s;on,</HI> that when he was preparing his lectures, he he&s;itated &s;o much, and rejected &s;o often, that at the time of reading he was often forced to produce, not what was be&s;t, but what happened to be at hand. This will be the &s;tate of every man, who, in the choice of his employment, balances all the arguments on every &s;ide. The complication is &s;o intricate, the mo|tives and objections &s;o numerous; there is &s;o much play for the inclination, and &s;o much remains in the power of others, that (rea&s;on forced at la&s;t to re&s;t in neutraility) the deci&s;ion devolves into the hands of chance; and after a great part of life &s;pent in inquiries which can never be re&s;olved, the re&s;t mu&s;t often pa&s;s in repenting the unne|ce&s;&s;ary delay; and can be u&s;eful to few other purpo&s;es, than to warn others again&s;t the &s;ame folly; and to &s;hew that of two &s;tates of life, equally con&s;i&s;tent with religion and virtue, he who chu&s;es earlie&s;t, and per&s;everes in it, chu&s;e&s;t be&s;t.</P>
<P>It is therefore of the utmo&s;t importance, that all who have any intention of doing well for them&s;elves or others, and of acquiring a reputation &s;uperior to the common names which are hourly &s;inking into oblivion, and &s;wept away by time among the refu&s;e of fame, &s;hould add to their rea&s;on and &s;pirit the power of per&s;i&s;ting in their purpo&s;e; &s;ince all the performances of human art, at which we look with prai&s;e or wonder, are in&s;tances of the

re&s;i&s;tle&s;s force of per&s;everance. It is by this that the quarry becomes a pyramid, and that di&s;tant countries are united by canals. If a man were to compare the effects of a &s;ingle &s;troke of the pick axe, or of one im|pre&s;&s;ion of the &s;pade, with the general de&s;ign and la&s;t effect, he would be overwhelmed by the &s;en&s;e of their di&s;proportion: Yet tho&s;e petty operations, ince&s;&s;antly continued, at la&s;t &s;urmount the greate&s;t difficulties; and mountains are levelled, and oceans bounded by the &s;len|der force of human beings.</P>

<P>I HAVE &s;ometimes heard it di&s;puted in conver&s;ation, whether it be more laudable or de&s;irable, that a man &s;hould think too highly or too meanly of him&s;elf: it is on all hands agreed to be be&s;t, that he &s;hould think right|ly; but &s;ince a falliable being will always make &s;ome de|viations from exact rectitude, it is not wholly u&s;ele&s;s to inquire towards which &s;ide it is &s;afer to incline.</P>
<P>The prejudices of mankind &s;eem to favour him who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> by under-rating his own powers; he is con&s;idered as a mode&s;t and harmle&s;s member of &s;ociety, not likely to break the peace by competition, to endeavour after &s;uch &s;plendor of reputation as may dim the lu&s;tre of others, or to interrupt any in the enjoyment of them&s;elves; he is no man's rival, and therefore may be every man's friend.</P>
<P>The opinion which a man entertains of him&s;elf, ought to be di&s;tingui&s;hed, in order to an accurate di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this que&s;tion, as it relates to per&s;ons or to things. To think highly of our&s;elves in compari&s;on with others, to a&s;&s;ume by our own authority that precedence which none are willing to grant, mu&s;t be always invidious and offen|&s;ive; but to rate our powers high in proportion to things, and imagine our&s;elves equal to great undertakings, while we leave others in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame abilities, cannot with equal ju&s;tice provoke cen&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="029518_0086_0FE1CD1DA2463B20">
It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that &s;elf-love may di&s;po&s;e us to decide too ha&s;tily in our own favour; but who is hurt by the mi&s;take? If we are incited by this vain opinion to attempt more than we can perform, ours is the labour, and ours is the di&s;grace.</P>
<P>But he that dares to think well of him&s;elf, will not al|ways prove to be mi&s;taken; and the good effects of his confidence will then appear in great attempts, and great performances: if he &s;hould not fully complete his de|&s;ign, he will at lea&s;t advance it &s;o far, as to leave an ea&s;y ta&s;k for him what &s;ucceeds him; and even though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;hould wholly fail, he will fail with honour.</P>
<P>But from the oppo&s;ite error, from torpid de&s;pondency can come no advantage; it is the fro&s;t of the &s;oul which binds up all its powers, and congeals life in perpetual &s;terility. He that has no hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, will make no attempts; and where nothing is attempted, nothing will be done.</P>
<P>Every man &s;hould, therefore, endeavour to maintain in him&s;elf a favourable opinion of the powers of the human mind; which are, perhaps, in every man greater than they appear, and might, by diligent cultivation, be exalted to a degree beyond what their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or pre&s;umes to believe. There is &s;carce any man but has found him|&s;elf able, at the in&s;tigation of nece&s;&s;ity, to do what in a &s;tate of lei&s;ure and deliberation he would have concluded impo&s;&s;ible; and &s;ome of our &s;pecies have &s;ignalized them&s;elves by &s;uch atchievements, as prove there are few things above human hope.</P>
<P>It has been the policy of all nations to pre&s;erve, by &s;ome public monuments, the memory of tho&s;e who have &s;erved their country by great exploits <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> there is the &s;ame rea&s;on for continuing or reviving the names of tho&s;e who&s;e exten&s;ive abilities have dignified humanity.

<P>Among the favourites of nature that have from time to time appeared in the world, enriched with various endow|ments and contrarieties of excellence, none &s;eems to have been more exalted above the common rate of humanity, than the man known about two centuries ago by the

appellation of the Admirable <HI>Crichton;</HI> of who&s;e hi&s;tory, whatever we may &s;uppre&s;s as &s;urpa&s;&s;ing credibility, yet we &s;hall, upon inconte&s;tible authority, relate enough to rank him among prodigies.</P>
<P>Virtue, &s;ays <HI>Virgil,</HI> is better accepted when it comes in a plea&s;ing form. The per&s;on of <HI>Crichton</HI> was eminently beautiful; but his beauty was con&s;i&s;tent with &s;uch activ|ity and &s;trength, that in fencing he would &s;pring at one bound the length of twenty feet upon his antagoni&s;t; and he u&s;ed the &s;word in either hand with &s;uch force and dexterity, that &s;carce any one had courage to engage him.</P>
<P>Having &s;tudied at St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> he went to <HI>Paris</HI> in his twenty-fir&s;t year, and affixed on the gate of the college of <HI>Navarre,</HI> a kind of challenge to the learn|ed of that univer&s;ity, to di&s;pute with them on a certain day; offering to his opponents, whoever they might be, the choice of ten languages, and of all the faculties and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ences. On the day appointed, three thou&s;and auditors a&s;&s;embled, when four doctors of the church, and fifty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ters appeared again&s;t him; and one of his antagoni&s;ts confe&s;&s;es that the doctors were defeated; that he gave proofs of knowledge above the reach of man; and that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> hundred years pa&s;&s;ed without food or &s;leep would not be &s;ufficient for the attainment of his learning. After a di&s;putation of nine hours, he was pre&s;ented by the pre&s;i|dent and profe&s;&s;ors with a diamond and pur&s;e of gold, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with repeated acclamations.</P>
<P>From <HI>Paris</HI> he went to <HI>Rome,</HI> where he made the &s;ame challenge, and had in the pre&s;ence of the Pope and Car|dinals the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s. Afterwards he contracted at <HI>Venice</HI> an acquaintance with <HI>Aldus Manutius,</HI> by whom he was introduced to the learned of that city; he then vi&s;ited <HI>Padua,</HI> where he engaged in another public di&s;putation, beginning his performance with an extempore poem in prai&s;e of the city and the a&s;&s;embly then pre&s;ent, and con|cluding with an oration equally unpremeditated in com|mendation of ignorance.</P>
<P>He afterwards publi&s;hed another challenge, in which he declared him&s;elf ready to detect the errors of <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> and all his commentators, either in the common forms of logic, or in any which his antagoni&s;ts &s;hould propo&s;e, of an hundred different kinds of ver&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e acqui&s;itions of learning, however &s;tupendous,
<PB N="172" REF="029518_0087_0FE1CD20DBAF5B48">
were not gained at the expence of any plea&s;ure which youth generally indulges, or by the omi&s;&s;ion of any ac|compli&s;hment in which it becomes a gentleman to excel: he practi&s;ed in great perfection the arts of drawing and painting; he was an eminent performer in both vocal and in&s;trumental mu&s;ic; he danced with uncommon grace|fulne&s;s; and on the day after his di&s;putation at <HI>Paris,</HI> exhibited his &s;kill in hor&s;eman&s;hip before the court of <HI>France,</HI> where, at a public match of tilting, he bore away the ring upon his lance fifteen times together.</P>
<P>He excelled likewi&s;e in dome&s;tic games of le&s;s dignit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> and reputation; and in the interval between his chal|lenge and di&s;putation at <HI>Paris,</HI> he &s;pent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> much of his time at cards, dice, and tennis, that a lampoon was fixed upon the gate of the <HI>Sorbonne,</HI> directing tho&s;e who would &s;ee this mon&s;ter of erudition, to look for him a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the tav|ern.</P>
<P>So exten&s;ive was his acquaintance with life and man|ners, that in an <HI>Italian</HI> comedy, compo&s;ed by him&s;elf and exhibited before the court of <HI>Mantua,</HI> he is &s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> have per&s;onated fifteen different characters, in all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he might &s;ucceed without great difficulty; &s;ince <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;uch power of retention, that once hearing an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> an hour, he would repeat it exactly, and in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> follow the &s;peaker through all the variety of tone and ge&s;ticulation.</P>
<P>Nor was his &s;kill in arms le&s;s than in learning, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> his courage inferior to his &s;kill. There was a prize-fighter at <HI>Mantua,</HI> who, (travelling about the world, according to the barbarous cu&s;tom of that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, as a general chal|lenger) had defeated the mo&s;t celebrated ma&s;ters in ma|ny parts of Europe; and in <HI>Mantua</HI> where he then re&s;ided, had killed three that appeared again&s;t him. The Duke repented that he had granted him his protection; when <HI>Crichton,</HI> looking on his &s;anguinary &s;ucce&s;s with indigna|tion, offered to &s;take fifteen hundred pi&s;toles, and mount the &s;tage again&s;t him. The Duke with &s;ome reluctance con&s;ented; and on the day fixed, the combatants appear|ed: their weapons &s;eemed to have been the &s;ingle rapier, which was then newly introduced into <HI>Italy.</HI> The prize-fighter advanced with greater violence and fiercene&s;s, while <HI>Crichton</HI> contented him&s;elf calmly to ward his pa&s;&s;es, and &s;uffered him to exhau&s;t his vigour by his own fury.
<PB N="173" REF="029518_0087_0FE1CD20DBAF5B48">
<HI>Crichton</HI> then became the a&s;&s;ailant; and pre&s;&s;ed upon him with &s;uch force and agility, that he thru&s;t him thrice through the body, and &s;aw him expire. He then divided the prize he had won, among the windows who&s;e hu&s;bands had been killed.</P>
<P>The death of this wonderful man I &s;hould be willing to conceal, did I not know that every reader will inquire curiou&s;ly after that fatal hour, which is common to all human beings, however di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other by nature or fortune.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Mantua</HI> having received &s;o many proofs of his various merit, made him tutor to his &s;on <HI>Vincentia de Conzaga,</HI> a prince of loo&s;e manners and turbulent di&s;|po&s;ition. On this occa&s;ion it was that he compo&s;ed the comedy in which he exhibited &s;o many different charac|ters with exact propriety. But his honour was of &s;hort continuance; for as he was one night in time of <HI>Carnival</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">bling about the &s;treets with his guitar in his hand, he was attacked by &s;ix men ma&s;ked. Neither his courage nor &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ill at this exigence de&s;erted him; he oppo&s;ed them with &s;uch activity and &s;pirit, that he &s;oon di&s;per&s;ed th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n, and di&s;armed their leader, who throwing off his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;covered him&s;elf to be the prince his pupil. <HI>Crichton,</HI> falling on his knees, took his own &s;word by the point, and pre&s;ented it to the prince; who immediately &s;eized it, and in&s;tigated, as &s;ome &s;ay, by jealou&s;y, ac|cording to others only by drunken fury and brutal re&s;ent|ment, ba&s;ely thru&s;t him through the heart.</P>
<P>Thus was the Admirable <HI>Crichton</HI> brought into that &s;tate in which he could excel the meane&s;t of mankind only by a few empty honours paid to his memory. The court of <HI>Mantua</HI> te&s;tified their e&s;teem by public mourn|ing; the cotemporary wits were profu&s;e of their enco|miums; and the palaces of <HI>Italy</HI> were adorned with pic|tures, repre&s;enting him on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> hor&s;eback, with a lance in one hand, and a book in the other.</P>

<P>BODILY labour is of two kinds, either that which a man &s;ubmits to for his livelihood, or that which
<PB N="174" REF="029518_0088_0FE1CD2279F017A0">
he undergoes for his plea&s;ure. The latter of them gen|erally changes the name of labour for that of exerci&s;e, but differs only from ordinary labour as it ri&s;es from another motive.</P>
<P>A country life abounds in both the&s;e kinds of labour, and for that rea&s;on gives a man a greater &s;tock of health, and con&s;equently a more perfect enjoyment of him&s;elf&punc; than any other way of life. I con&s;ider the body as a &s;y&s;tem of tubes and glands; or, to u&s;e a more ru&s;tic phra&s;e, a bundle of pipes and &s;trainers, fitted to one another after &s;o wonderful a manner&punc; as to make a prop|er engine for the &s;oul to work with. This de&s;cription does not only comprehend the bowels, bones, tendons, veins, nerves, and arteries, but every mu&s;cle, every liga|ture, which is a compo&s;ition of fibres, that are &s;o many imperceptible tubes or pipes interwoven on all &s;ides with invi&s;ible glands or &s;trainers.</P>
<P>The general idea of a human body, without con&s;ider|ing it in the niceties of anatomy, lets us &s;ee how ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary labour is for the right pre&s;ervation of it. There mu&s;t be frequent motions and agitations, to mix, dige&s;t, and &s;eparate the juices contained in it, as well as to clear and clean&s;e that infinitude of pipes and &s;trainers of which it is compo&s;ed, and to give their &s;olid parts a more firm and la&s;ting tone. Labour or exerci&s;e ferments the humours, ca&s;ts them into their proper channel, throws off redundancies, and helps nature in tho&s;e &s;ecret di&s;tributions, without which the body cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t in its vigour, nor the &s;oul act with cheerfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>I might here mention the effects which this has upon all the faculties of the mind, by keeping the under&s;tand|ing clear, the imagination untroubled, and refining tho&s;e &s;pirits that are nece&s;&s;ary for the proper exertion of our intellectual faculties, during the pre&s;ent laws of union between &s;oul and body. It is to a neglect in this particular that we mu&s;t a&s;cribe the &s;pleen, which is &s;o frequent in men of &s;tudious and &s;edentary tempers; as well as the vapours, to which tho&s;e of the other &s;ex are &s;o often &s;ubject. Had not exerci&s;e been ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary for our well-being, nature would not have made the body &s;o proper for it, by giving &s;uch an activity to the limbs, and &s;uch a plenty to every part, as nece&s;&s;arily pro|duce the&s;e compre&s;&s;ions, exten&s;ions, contortions, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="175" REF="029518_0088_0FE1CD2279F017A0">
and all other kinds of motions, that are nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation of &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of tubes and glands, as ha&s;t been before mentioned. And that we might not want inducement to engage us in &s;uch an exerci&s;e of the body as is proper for its welfare, it is &s;o ordered, that nothing valuable can be procured without it. Not to mention riches and honour, even food and raiment are not to be come at, without the toil of the hands and &s;weat of the brow. Providence furni&s;hes materials, but expects that we &s;hould work them up our&s;elves. The earth mu&s;t be laboured before it gives its increa&s;e; and when it is forced into its &s;everal products, how many hands mu&s;t they pa&s;s through before they are fit for u&s;e! manufactures, trade, and agriculture, naturally employ more than nineteen parts of the &s;pecies in twenty; and as for tho&s;e who are not obliged to labour, by the con|dition in which they are born, they are more mi&s;erable than the re&s;t of mankind, unle&s;s they indulge them&s;elves in that voluntary labour which goes by the name of Exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>As I am a compound of &s;oul and body, I con&s;ider my|&s;elf as obliged to a double &s;cheme of duties; and I think I have not fulfilled the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day, when I do not thus employ the one in labour and exerci&s;e, as well as the other in contemplation and &s;tudy.</P>

When, as the &s;tory goes, the virtue of the medicaments per&s;piring through the wood, had &s;o good an influence on the Sul|tan's con&s;titution, that they cured him of an indi&s;po&s;ition which all the compo&s;itions he had taken inwardly had not been able to remove. This ea&s;tern allegory is finely contrived to &s;hew us how beneficial bodily labour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to health, and that exerci&s;e is the mo&s;t effectual phy&s;ic. I &s;hall in this place recommend another great pre&s;ervative of health, which in many ca&s;es produces the &s;ame effect as exerci&s;e, and may, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;upply its place where opportunities of exerci&s;e are wanting. The pre|&s;ervative I am &s;peaking of is temperance, which has tho&s;e particular advantages above all other means of health, that it may be practi&s;ed by all ranks and conditions, at any &s;ea&s;on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> or in any place. It is a kind of regimen into which every man may put him&s;elf, without interruption to bu&s;ine&s;s, expence of money, or lo&s;s of time. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> exerci&s;e throws off all &s;uperfluities, temperance prevents them; if exerci&s;e clears the ve&s;&s;els, temperance neither &s;atiates nor over&s;trains them; if exerci&s;e rai&s;e proper ferments in the humours, and promotes the circulation of the blood, temperance gives nature her full play, and enables her to exert her&s;elf in all her force and vigour. If exer|ci&s;e di&s;&s;ipates a growing di&s;temper, temperance &s;tarves it.</P>
<P>Phy&s;ic, for the mo&s;t part, is nothing el&s;e but the &s;ub&s;ti|tute of exerci&s;e or temperance. Medicines are indeed ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in acute di&s;tempers, that cannot wait the &s;low operations of the&s;e two great in&s;truments of health; but did men live in an habitual cour&s;e of ex|erci&s;e and temperance, there would be but little occa&s;ion for them. Accordingly we find that tho&s;e parts of the world are mo&s;t healthy, where they &s;ub&s;i&s;t by the chace; and that men lived longe&s;t when their lives were employed in hunting, and when they had little food be&s;ides what they caught. Bli&s;tering, cupping, and bleeding, are &s;eldom of u&s;e but to the idle and intemperate; as all tho&s;e inward applications, which are &s;o much in practice among us, are for the mo&s;t part nothing el&s;e but expedi|ents to make luxury con&s;i&s;tent with health. The apoth|ecary is perpetually employed in countermining the cook and the vintner. It is &s;aid of <HI>Diogenes,</HI> that meeting a

young man who was going to a fea&s;t, he took him up in the &s;treet and carried him home to his friends, as one who was running into imminent danger, had he not pre|vented him. What would the philo&s;opher have &s;aid, had he been pre&s;ent at the gluttony of a modern meal? Would not he have thought the ma&s;ter of a family mad, and have begged his &s;ervants to tie down his hands, had he &s;een him devour fowl, fi&s;h, and fle&s;h; &s;wallow oil and vinegar, wines and &s;pices; throw down &s;allads of twenty different herbs, &s;auces of an hundred ingredients, con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">tions, and fruits of numberle&s;s &s;weets and flowers&punc; What unnatural motions and counter-ferments mu&s;t &s;uch a medley of intemperance produce in the body!

<P>Nature delights in the mo&s;t plain and &s;imple diet. Every animal, but man, keeps to one di&s;h. Herbs are the food of this &s;pecies, fi&s;h of that, and fle&s;h of a third. Man falls upon every thing that comes in his way; not the &s;malle&s;t fruit or excre&s;cence of the earth, &s;carce a berry or mu&s;hroom can e&s;cape him.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to lay down any determinate rule for temperance, becau&s;e what is luxury in one may be tem|perance in another; but there are few that have lived any time in the world who are not judges of their own con&s;titution, &s;o far as to know what kinds and what pro|portion of food do be&s;t agree with them. Were I to con|&s;ider my readers as my patients, and to pre&s;cribe &s;uch a kind of temperance as is accommodated to all per&s;ons, and &s;uch as is particularly &s;uited to our climate and way of living, I would copy the following rules of a very em|inent phy&s;ician. Make your whole repa&s;t out of one di&s;h. If you indulge in a &s;econd, avoid drinking any thing &s;trong until you have fini&s;hed your meal: at the &s;ame time, ab&s;tain from all &s;auces, or at lea&s;t from &s;uch as are not the mo&s;t plain and &s;imple. A man could not well be guilty of gluttony, if he &s;tuck to the&s;e few obvious and ea&s;y rules. In the fir&s;t ca&s;e there would be no variety of ta&s;tes to &s;olicit his palate, and occa&s;ion exce&s;s; nor in the &s;econd, any artificial provocatives to relieve &s;atiety, and create a fal&s;e appetite. Were I to pre&s;cribe a rule for
<PB N="178" REF="029518_0090_0FE1CD2DCF03F6B0">
drinking, it would be formed upon a &s;aying quoted by Sir <HI>William Temple; The fir&s;t gla&s;s for my&s;elf, the &s;econd for my friends, the third for good humour, and the fourth for my enemies.</HI> But becau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible for one who lives in the world to diet him&s;elf always in &s;o philo&s;ophical a manner, I think every man &s;hould have his days of ab&s;ti|nence, according as his con&s;titution will permit. The&s;e are great reliefs to nature, as they qualify it for &s;trug|gling with hunger and thir&s;t, whenever any di&s;temper or duty of life puts it upon &s;uch difficulties; and at the &s;ame time give it an opportunity of extricating it&s;elf from its oppre&s;&s;ions, and recovering the &s;everal tones and &s;prings of its di&s;tended ve&s;&s;els. Be&s;ides, that ab&s;tinence well-timed often kills a &s;ickne&s;s in embrio, and de&s;troys the fir&s;t &s;eeds of an indi&s;po&s;ition. It is ob&s;erved by two or three ancient authors, that <HI>Socrates,</HI> notwith&s;tanding he lives in <HI>Athens</HI> during the great plague which has made &s;o much noi&s;e throughout all ages, and has been celebrated at different times by &s;uch eminent hands: I &s;ay, not|with&s;tanding that he lived in the time of this devouring pe&s;tilence, he never caught the lea&s;t infection, which tho&s;e writers unanimou&s;ly a&s;cribe to that uninterrupted temperance which he always ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>And here I cannot but mention an ob&s;ervation which I have often made, upon reading the lives of the philo&s;o|phers, and comparing it with any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eries of kings or great men of the &s;ame number. If we con&s;ider the&s;e ancient &s;ages, a great part of who&s;e philo&s;ophy con&s;i&s;ted in a temperate and ab&s;temious cour&s;e of life, one would think the life of a philo&s;opher and the life of a man, were of two different dates: for we find the generality of the&s;e wi&s;e men were nearer an hundred than &s;ixty years of age at the time of their re&s;pective deaths.</P>
<P>The benefits ari&s;ing from a temperate cour&s;e of life are &s;et in a &s;till more &s;triking light, in the following allegory of</P>

<P>MENNIPUS, the philo&s;opher, was a &s;econd time taken up into heaven by <HI>Jupiter,</HI> when, for his entertain|ment, he lifted up a trap-door that was placed by his foot&s;tool. At its ri&s;ing there i&s;&s;ued through it &s;uch a di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of cries as a&s;toni&s;hed the philo&s;opher. Upon his a&s;king what they meant, <HI>Jupiter</HI> told him they were the prayers that were &s;ent up to him from the earth. <HI>Men|nipus,</HI> amid&s;t the confu&s;ion of voices, which was &s;o great that nothing le&s;s than the ear of <HI>Jove</HI> could di&s;tingui&s;h them, heard the words <HI>riches, honour, long life,</HI> repeated in &s;everal different tones and languages. When the fir&s;t hubbub of &s;ounds was over, the trap-door being left open, the voices came up more &s;eparate and di&s;tinct. The fir&s;t prayer was a very odd one; it came from <HI>Athens,</HI> and de&s;ired <HI>Jupiter</HI> to increa&s;e the wi&s;dom and the beard of his humble &s;uppliant. <HI>Mennipus</HI> knew it, by the voice, to be the prayer of his friend <HI>Lycander,</HI> the philo&s;opher. This was &s;ucceeded by the petition of one who had ju&s;t
<PB N="181" REF="029518_0091_0FE1CD31AF51D0B8">
laden a &s;hip, and promi&s;ed <HI>Jupiter,</HI> if he took care of it, and returned it home again full of riches, he would make him an offering of a &s;ilver cup. <HI>Jupiter</HI> thanked him for nothing; and bending down his ear more attentively than ordinary, heard a voice complaining to him of the cru|elty of an <HI>Ephe&s;ian</HI> widow, and begging him to breed compa&s;&s;ion in her heart: this, &s;ays <HI>Jupiter,</HI> is a very hon|e&s;t fellow. I have received a great deal of incen&s;e from him; I will not be &s;o cruel to him as to hear his prayers. He was then interrupted with a whole volley of vows, which were made for the health of a tyrannical prince by his &s;ubjects, who prayed for him in his pre&s;ence. <HI>Men|nipus</HI> was &s;urpri&s;ed, after having li&s;tened to prayers offer|ed up with &s;o much ardour and devotion, to hear low whi&s;pers from the &s;ame a&s;&s;embly, expo&s;tulating with <HI>Jove</HI> for &s;uffering &s;uch a tyrant to live, and a&s;king how his thunder could lie idle? <HI>Jupiter</HI> was &s;o offended at the&s;e prevaricating ra&s;cals, that he took down the fir&s;t vows, and puffed away the la&s;t. The philo&s;opher, &s;eeing a great cloud mounting upwards, and making its way di|rectly to the trap-door, inquired of <HI>Jupiter</HI> what it meant. This, &s;ays <HI>Jupiter,</HI> is the &s;moke of a whole hecatomb that is offered me by the general of an army, who is very im|portunate with me to let him cut off an hundred thou&s;and men that are drawn up in array again&s;t him: what does the impudent wretch think I &s;ee in him, to believe that I will make a &s;acrifice of &s;o many mortals as good as him&s;elf, and all this to his glory, for&s;ooth?&mdash;But hark, &s;ays <HI>Jupiter,</HI> there is a voice I never heard but in time of danger; it is a rogue that is &s;hipwrecked in the <HI>IonianSea:</HI> I &s;aved him upon a plank but three days ago, upon his promi&s;e to mend his manners; the &s;coundrel is not worth a groat, and yet has the impudence to offer me a temple if I will keep him from &s;inking. But yonder, &s;ays he, is a &s;pecial youth for you; he de&s;ires me to take his father, who keeps a great e&s;tate from him, out of the mi&s;eries of human life. The old fellow &s;hall live till he make his heart ache, I can tell him that for his pains. This was followed by the &s;oft voice of a pious lady, de|&s;iring <HI>Jupiter</HI> that &s;he might appear amiable and charming in the &s;ight of her Emperor. As the philo&s;opher was re|flecting on this extraordinary petition, there blew a gen|tle wind through the trap-door, which he at fir&s;t mi&s;took
<PB N="182" REF="029518_0092_0FE1CD3350E14618">
for a gale of <HI>zephyrs,</HI> but afterwards found it to be a breeze of &s;ighs: they &s;melt &s;trong of flowers and incen&s;e, and were &s;ucceeded by mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate complaints of wounds and torment, fire and arrows, cruelty, de&s;pair, and death. <HI>Mennipus</HI> fancied that &s;uch lamentable cries aro&s;e from &s;ome general execution, or from wretches ly|ing under the torture; but <HI>Jupiter</HI> told him, they came to him from the i&s;le of <HI>Paphos,</HI> and that he every day received complaints of the &s;ame nature from that whim|&s;ical tribe of mortals who are called Lovers. I am &s;o trifled with, &s;ays he, by this generation of both &s;exes, and find it &s;o impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e them, whether I grant or refu&s;e their petitions, that I &s;hall order a we&s;tern wind for the future to intercept them in their pa&s;&s;age, and blow them at random upon the earth. The la&s;t petition I heard was from a very aged man, near a hundred years old, begging but for one year more of life, and then promi&s;ed to die contented. This is the rare&s;t old fellow, &s;ays <HI>Jupiter;</HI> he has made this prayer to me for above twenty years together. When he was but fifty years old he de&s;ired only that he might live to &s;ee his &s;on &s;ettled in the world; I granted it. He then begged the &s;ame favour for his daughter, and afterwards that he might &s;ee the education of a grand&s;on. When all this was brought about, he put up a petition that he might live to fini&s;h a hou&s;e he was building. In &s;hort, he is an un|rea&s;onable old cur, and never wants an excu&s;e; I will hear no more of him. Upon which he flung down the trap-door in a pa&s;&s;ion, and was re&s;olved to give no more audiences that day.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the levity of this fable, the moral of it very well de&s;erves our attention. The vanity of men's wi&s;hes, which are the natural prayers of the mind, as well as many of tho&s;e &s;ecret devotions which they offer up to the Supreme Being, are &s;ufficiently expo&s;ed by it. Among other rea&s;ons for &s;et forms of prayer, I have often thought it a very good one, that by this means the folly and extravagance of men's de&s;ires may be kept within due bounds, and not break out in ab&s;urd and ridiculous petitions on &s;o great and &s;olemn an occa&s;ion.</P>

<P>ALNASCHAR was a very idle fellow, that never would &s;et his hand to any bu&s;ine&s;s during his father's life.

The&s;e he piled up in a large open ba&s;ket, and having made choice of a very little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, placed the ba&s;ket at his feet, and leaned his back again&s;t the wall, in expectation of cu&s;tomers. As he &s;at in this po&s;ture, with his eyes upon the ba&s;ket, he fell in|to a mo&s;t amu&s;ing train of thought, and was overheard by one of the neighbours, as he talked to him&s;elf, in the following manner: "This ba&s;ket, &s;ays he, co&s;t me at the whole&s;ale merchant's an hundred drachmas, which is all I have in the world.

The&s;e two hundred drachmas will in a very little time ri&s;e to four hundred, which of cour&s;e will amount in time to four thou&s;and.

As &s;oon as by this means I am ma&s;te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of ten thou&s;and, I will lay a&s;ide my trade as a gla&s;sman, and turn jeweller.

<P><HI>Pro&s;perity,</HI> the elder, was beautiful as the morning, and

cheerful as the &s;pring; but <HI>Adver&s;ity</HI> was &s;orrowful and ill-favoured.</P>
<P><HI>Vela&s;co</HI> had two &s;ons, <HI>Felix</HI> and <HI>Uranio.</HI> They were both bred to commerce, though liberally educated, and had lived together from their infancy in the &s;tricte&s;t har|mony and friend&s;hip. But love, before whom all the affections of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oul are as the t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aces of a &s;hip upon the ocean, which remain only for a moment, threatened, in an evil hour, to &s;et them at variance; for both were be|come enamoured with the beauties of <HI>Pro&s;perity.</HI> The nymph, like one of the daughters of men, gave encour|agement to each by turns; but, to avoid a particular declaration, &s;he avowed a re&s;olution never to marry, un|le&s;s her &s;i&s;ter, from whom &s;he &s;aid it was impo&s;&s;ible for her to be long &s;eparate, was married at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P><HI>Vela&s;co,</HI> who was no &s;tranger to the pa&s;&s;ions of his &s;ons, and who dreaded every thing from their violence, to prevent con&s;equences, obliged them by his authority to decide their preten&s;ions by lots; each previou&s;ly en|gaging in a &s;olemn oath to marry the nymph that &s;hould fall to his &s;hare. The lots were accordingly drawn; and <HI>Pro&s;perity</HI> became the wife of <HI>Felix,</HI> and <HI>Adver&s;ity</HI> of <HI>Urax<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o.</HI></P>
<P>Soon after the celebration of the&s;e nuptials, <HI>Vela&s;co</HI> died, having bequeathed to his elde&s;t &s;on <HI>Felix,</HI> the hou&s;e wherein he dwelt, together with the greate&s;t part of his large fortune and effects.</P>
<P>The hu&s;band of <HI>Pro&s;perity</HI> was &s;o tran&s;ported with the gay di&s;po&s;ition and enchanting beauties of his bride, that he cloathed her in gold and &s;ilver, and adorned her with jewels of ine&s;timable value. He built a palace for her in the wood; he made rivers in his gardens, and beau|tified their banks with temples and pavilions. He enter|tained at his table the nobles of the land, delighting their ears with mu&s;ic, and their eyes with magnificence. But his kindred he beheld as &s;trangers, and the compan|ions of his youth pa&s;&s;ed by him unregarded. His brother al&s;o became hateful in his &s;ight, and, in proce&s;s of time, he commanded the doors of his hou&s;e to be &s;hut again&s;t him.</P>
<P>But as the &s;tream flows from its channel, and lo&s;es it&s;elf among the vallies, unle&s;s confined by mounds; &s;o al&s;o will the current of fortune be di&s;&s;ipated, unle&s;s

bounded by Economy. In a few years the e&s;tate of <HI>Felix</HI> was wa&s;ted by extravagance, his merchandize failed him by neglect, and his effects were &s;eized by the mercile&s;s hands of creditors. He applied him&s;elf for &s;upport to the nobles and great men, whom he had fea&s;ted and made pre&s;ents to: but his voice was as the voice of a &s;tranger, and they remembered not his face. The friends whom he had neglected derided him in their turn; his wife al&s;o in&s;ulted him, and turned her back upon him, and fled. Yet was his heart &s;o bewitched with her &s;orce|ries, that he pur&s;ued her with intreaties, till by her ha&s;te to abandon him, her ma&s;k fell off, and di&s;covered to him a face as withered and deformed, as before it had ap|peared youthful and engaging.</P>
<P>What became of him afterwards tradition does not relate with certainty. It is believed that he fled into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; and lived precariou&s;ly on the &s;canty benevolence of a few friends, who had not totally de&s;erted him, and that he died in a &s;hort time, wretched and an exile.</P>
<P>Let us now return to <HI>Uranio,</HI> who, as we have already ob&s;erved, had been driven out of doors by his brother <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">elix. Adver&s;ity,</HI> though hateful to his heart, and a &s;pec|tre to his eyes, was the con&s;tant attendant upon his &s;teps: and, to aggravate his &s;orrow, he received certain intelli|gence that his riche&s;t ve&s;&s;el was taken by a <HI>Sardinian</HI> pi|rate; that another was lo&s;t upon the <HI>Lybian Syrtes;</HI> and, to complete all, that the banker with whom the greate&s;t part of his ready money was entru&s;ted, had de&s;erted his creditors, and retired into <HI>Sicily.</HI> Collecting therefore the &s;mall remains of his fortune, he bade adieu to <HI>Tyre;</HI> and, led by <HI>Adver&s;ity,</HI> through unfrequented roads and fore&s;ts overgrown with thickets, he came at la&s;t to a &s;mall village at the foot of a mountain: here they took up their abode &s;ome time; and <HI>Adver&s;ity,</HI> in return for all the anxiety he had &s;uffered, &s;oftening the &s;everity of her looks, admini&s;tered to him the mo&s;t faithful coun&s;el, weaning his heart from the immoderate love of earthly things, and teaching him to revere the gods, and to place his whole tru&s;t and happine&s;s in their government and protection. She humanized his &s;oul, made him mode&s;t and humble, taught him to compa&s;&s;ionate the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of his fellow-creatures, and inclined him to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">lieve them.</P>

"I am &s;ent, &s;aid &s;he, by the gods, to tho&s;e only whom they love: for I not only train them up by my &s;evere di&s;cipline to future glory, but al&s;o prepare them to receive with greater reli&s;h all &s;uch moderate enjoyments as are not incon&s;i&s;tent with this probationary &s;tate. As the &s;pider, when a&s;&s;ailed, &s;eeks &s;helter in its inmo&s;t web&punc; &s;o the mind which I afflict, contracts its wandering thoughts and flies for happine&s;s to it&s;elf.

<P><HI>Uranio</HI> li&s;tened to her words with great attention; and as he looked earne&s;tly on her face, the deformity of it &s;eemed in&s;en&s;ibly to decrea&s;e. By gentle degrees his aver&s;ion to her abated; and at la&s;t he gave him&s;elf whol|ly up to her coun&s;el and direction. She would often repeat to him the wi&s;e maxims of the philo&s;opher&punc; "That tho&s;e who want the fewe&s;t things, approach near|e&s;t to the gods, who want nothing." She admoni&s;hed him to turn his eyes to the many thou&s;ands beneath him, in&s;tead of gazing on the few who live in pomp and &s;plen|dor; and in his addre&s;&s;es to the gods, in&s;tead of &s;uppli|cating for riches and popularity, to pray only for a vir|tuous mind, a quiet &s;tate, an unblameable life, and a hopeful death.</P>
<P>Finding him to be every day more and more compo&s;ed, and re&s;igned, though neither enamoured of her face, nor delighted with her &s;ociety, &s;he at la&s;t addre&s;&s;ed him in the following manner:</P>
<P>"As the gold is purged and refined from the dro&s;s by the fire, &s;o is <HI>Adver&s;ity</HI> &s;ent by Providence to try and im|prove the virtue of mortals.

<P><PB N="189" REF="029518_0095_0FE1CD49835B8328">
As &s;he pronounced the&s;e words, &s;he vani&s;hed from his fight. But though her features at that moment, in&s;tead of in&s;piring their u&s;ual horror, &s;eemed to di&s;play a kind of langui&s;hing beauty; yet as <HI>Uranio,</HI> in &s;pite of his ut|mo&s;t efforts, could not prevail on him&s;elf to love her, he neither regretted her departure, nor wi&s;hed for her return.

<P>He afterwards be took him&s;elf again to merchandize; and having in a &s;hort time acquired a competency &s;uffi|cient for a real enjoyment of life, he retreated to a little farm, which he had bought for that purpo&s;e, and where he determined to continue the remainder of his days. Here he employed his time in planting, gardening, and husbandry, in quelling all di&s;orderly pa&s;&s;ions, and in forming his mind by the le&s;&s;ons of <HI>Adver&s;ity.</HI> He took great delight in a little cell or hermitage in his garden, which &s;tood under a tuft of trees, encompa&s;&s;ed with eg|lantine and honey-&s;uckles.

<P>THE faculty of interchanging our thoughts with one another, or what we expre&s;s by the word <HI>conver&s;a|tion,</HI> has always been repre&s;ented by moral writers as one of the noble&s;t privileges of rea&s;on, and which more par|ticularly &s;ets mankind above the brute part of the crea|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="029518_0096_0FE1CD4B24ED9D00">
Though nothing &s;o much gains upon the affections as this <HI>extempore eloquence</HI> which we have con&s;tantly occa&s;ion for, and are obliged to practi&s;e every day, we very rarely meet with any who excel in it.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation of mo&s;t men is di&s;agreeable, not &s;o much for want of wit and learning, as of good-breading and di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>If you re&s;olve to plea&s;e, never &s;peak to gratify any particular vanity or pa&s;&s;ion of your own, but always with a de&s;ign either to divert or inform the company. A man who only aims at one of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e, is always ea&s;y in his di&s;cour&s;e. He is neve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> out of humour at being inter|rupted, becau&s;e he con&s;iders that tho&s;e who hear him are the be&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> whether what he was &s;aying could either divert or inform them.</P>
<P>A mode&s;t per&s;on &s;eldom fails to gain the good-will of tho&s;e he conver&s;es with, becau&s;e no body envies a man who does not appear to be plea&s;ed with him&s;elf.</P>
<P>We &s;hould talk extremely little of our&s;elves. Indeed what can we &s;ay? It would be as imprudent to di&s;cover our faults, as ridiculous to count our fancied virtues. Our private and dome&s;tic affairs are no le&s;s improper to be introduced in conver&s;ation. What does it concern the company how many hor&s;es you keep in your &s;table? Or whether your &s;ervant is more knave or fool?</P>
<P>A man may equally affront the company he is in, by ingro&s;&s;ing all the talk, or by ob&s;erving a contemptuous &s;ilence.</P>
<P>Before you tell a &s;tory, it may be generally not ami&s;s to draw a &s;hort character, and give the company a true idea of the principal per&s;ons concerned in it. The beauty of mo&s;t things con&s;i&s;ts not &s;o much in their being &s;aid or done, as in their being &s;aid or done by &s;uch a particular per&s;on, or on &s;uch a particular occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all the advantages of youth, few young people plea&s;e in conver&s;ation; the rea&s;on is, that want of experience makes them po&s;itive, and what they &s;ay is rather with a de&s;ign to plea&s;e them&s;elves than any one el&s;e.</P>
<P>It is certain that age it&s;elf will make many things pa&s;s well enough, which would have been laughed at in the mouth of one much younger.</P>
<P>Nothing however is more in&s;upportable to men of
<PB N="191" REF="029518_0096_0FE1CD4B24ED9D00">
&s;en&s;e, than an empty formal man, who &s;peaks in proverbs, and decides all controver&s;ies with a &s;hort &s;entence. This piece of &s;tupidity is the more in&s;ufferable, as it puts on the air of wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>A prudent man will avoid talking much of any particu|lar &s;cience, for which he is remarkably famous. There is not, methinks, a hand&s;omer thing &s;aid of Mr. <HI>Cowley,</HI> in his whole life, than that none but his intimate friends ever di&s;covered that he was a great poet by his di&s;cour&s;e: be&s;ides the decency of this rule, it is certainly founded on good policy. A man who talks of any thing he is already famous for, has nothing to get, but a great deal to lo&s;e. I might add, that he who is &s;ometimes &s;ilent on a &s;ubject where every one is &s;atisfied he could &s;peak well, will often be thought no le&s;s knowing in other matters, where perhaps he is wholly ignorant.</P>
<P>Women are frightened at the name of argument, and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;ooner convinced by a happy turn, or a witty expre&s;|&s;ion, than by demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>Whenever you commend, add your rea&s;ons for doing &s;o; it is this which di&s;tingui&s;hes the approbation of a man of &s;en&s;e from the flattery of &s;ycophants and the admiration of fools.</P>
<P>Raillery is no longer agreeable than while the whole company is plea&s;ed with it. I would lea&s;t of all be under|&s;tood to except the per&s;on railed at.</P>
<P>Though good humour, &s;en&s;e, and di&s;cretion can &s;eldom fail to make a man agreeable, it may be no ill policy &s;ometimes to prepare your&s;elf in a particular manner for conver&s;ation, by looking a little farther than your neigh|bours into whatever is become a reigning &s;ubject. If our armies are be&s;ieging a place of importance abroad, or our Hou&s;e of Commons debating a bill of con&s;equence at home, you can hardly fail of being heard with plea&s;ure, if you have nicely informed your&s;elf of the &s;trength, &s;itua|tion, and hi&s;tory of the former, or of the rea&s;ons for and again&s;t the latter. It will have the &s;ame effect, if, when any &s;ingle per&s;on begins to make a noi&s;e in the world, you can learn &s;ome of the &s;malle&s;t incidents in his life or conver&s;ation; which, though they are too fine for the ob&s;ervation of the vulgar, give more &s;atisfaction to men of &s;en&s;e, (as they are the be&s;t openings to a real character) than the recital of his mo&s;t glaring actions. I know but
<PB N="192" REF="029518_0097_0FE1CD4CC8AE4270">
one ill con&s;equence to be feared from this method, name|ly, that coming full charged into company, you &s;hould re&s;olve to unload, whether a hand&s;ome opportunity offers it&s;elf or not.</P>
<P>Though a&s;king of que&s;tions may plead for it&s;elf the &s;pecious name of mode&s;ty, and a de&s;ire of information, it affords little plea&s;ure to the re&s;t of the company who may not be troubled with the &s;ame doubts; be&s;ides which, he who a&s;ks a que&s;tion would do well to con&s;ider that he lies wholly at the mercy of another before he receives an an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Nothing is more &s;illy than the plea&s;ure &s;ome people take in what they c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ll <HI>&s;peaking their minds.</HI> A man of this make will &s;ay a rude thing for the mere plea&s;ure of &s;aying it, when an oppo&s;ite behaviour, full as innocent, might have pre&s;erved his friend, or made his fortune.</P>
<P>It is not impo&s;&s;ible for a man to form to him&s;elf as exqui&s;ite a plea&s;ure in complying with the humours and &s;entiments of others, as of bringing others over to his own; &s;ince it is the certain &s;ign of a &s;uperior genius, that it can take and become whatever dre&s;s it plea&s;es.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add, that be&s;ides what I have here &s;aid, there is &s;omething which can never be learned but in the company of the polite. The virtues of men are catching as well as their vices; and your own ob&s;ervations added to the&s;e, will &s;oon di&s;cover what it is that commands attention in one man, and makes you tired and di&s;plea&s;ed with the di&s;cour&s;e of another.</P>

It happened one day that two knights completely armed, the one in <HI>black</HI> armour, and the other in <HI>white,</HI> arrived from oppo&s;ite parts of the country at this &s;tatue, ju&s;t about the &s;ame time; and as neither of them had &s;een it before, they &s;topped to read the in&s;criptions, and ob&s;erve the excellence of its workman&s;hip. After con|templating it for &s;ome time, This <HI>golden</HI> &s;hield, &s;ays the <HI>black</HI> knight&mdash;<HI>Golden</HI> &s;hield, cried the <HI>White</HI> knight, (who was &s;trictly ob&s;erving the oppo&s;ite &s;ide) why, if I have my eyes, it is &s;ilver. I know nothing of your eyes, replied the <HI>black</HI> knight; but if ever I &s;aw a <HI>golden</HI> &s;hield in my life, this is one: yes, returned the <HI>White</HI> knight &s;miling, it is very probable indeed, that they &s;hould ex|po&s;e a &s;hield of gold in &s;o public a place as this: for my part, I wonder even a &s;ilver one is not too &s;trong a temp|tation for the devotion of &s;ome people that pa&s;s this way; and it appears by the date, that this has been here above three years. The <HI>black</HI> knight could not bear the &s;mile with which this was delivered, and grew &s;o warm in the di&s;pute, that it &s;oon ended in a challenge; they both therefore turned their hor&s;es, and rode back &s;o far as to have &s;ufficient &s;pace for their career, then fixed their &s;pears in their re&s;ts, and flew at each other with the greate&s;t fury and impetuo&s;ity.

A good <HI>Druid,</HI> who was travelling that way, found them in this condition. The <HI>Druids</HI> were the phy&s;icians of tho&s;e times, as well as the <HI>prie&s;ts.</HI> He had a &s;overeign bal&s;am about him, which he had compo&s;ed him&s;elf, for he was very &s;kilful in all the plants that grew in the fields, or in the fore&s;ts; he &s;taunched their blood, applied his bal&s;am to their wounds, and brought them as it were from death to life again. As &s;oon as they were &s;ufficiently recovered, he began to inquire into the occa&s;ion of their quarrel. "Why, this man, cried the <HI>black</HI> knight, will have it, that that &s;hield yonder is &s;ilver." "And he will have it, replied the <HI>white</HI> knight, that it is gold;" and then told him all the particulars of the affair. "Ah! &s;aid the <HI>Druid,</HI> with a &s;igh, you are both of you, my brethren, in the right, and both of you in the wrong: had either of you given him|&s;elf time to look upon the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the &s;hield, as

<P>IT is ob&s;ervable that <HI>Mahomet,</HI> in a particular manner, forbade gaming and drunkenne&s;s to his followers, when at the &s;ame time he indulged them with plurality of women. The la&s;t of which he looked upon as a pa&s;|&s;ion, the &s;eeds of which are implanted as it were in our nature: whereas gaming and drunkenne&s;s he ab&s;olutely forbade, as acquired and unnatural vices; as vices pro|ductive of the mo&s;t dreadful con&s;equences. I will not at pre&s;ent examine the ju&s;tne&s;s of the compliment paid to amorous libertini&s;m, which he certainly carried too far; but &s;hall ob&s;erve, that his &s;trict commands in regard to gaming and drunkenne&s;s, have contributed more than any of his other injunctions to the happine&s;s of his fol|lowers.</P>
<P>Gaming (which I &s;hall at pre&s;ent con&s;ider) &s;eems to me of all vices the greate&s;t enemy of happine&s;s: its in|&s;eparable attendants are envy, deceit, profu&s;ene&s;s, impi|ety, and a whole train of diabolical a&s;&s;ociates. Health, peace of mind, love, family, friends, country, and in &s;hort every thing valuable or de&s;irable, are &s;acrificed to it. And to what then are they &s;acrificed? Why, to ava|rice: avarice, the meane&s;t of vices. The love of gaming is nothing more than the love of other people's money. It is not the avarice of a mi&s;er; it is the avarice of a thief, a robber; or rather the cowardly avarice of a pick-pocket. It is avarice and profu&s;ion join|ed together; a mo&s;t unnatural conjunction, and productive of more terrible con&s;equences than either of them &s;ingly can po&s;&s;ibly be: like <HI>Aaron'</HI>s rod, it ab|&s;orbs, it &s;wallows up, and contains within it&s;elf all other vices and may ju&s;tly among vices be &s;tiled <HI>Legion;</HI> and

of all baits made u&s;e of by the grand enemy of mankind, to tempt us from our duty, and make us unhappy here-after, gaming &s;eems the mo&s;t dangerous, and the be&s;t to an&s;wer his diabolical ends.</P>
<P>It is ridiculous to hear the votaries of gaming term it an amu&s;ement, an inoffen&s;ive relaxation, &amp;c;. Tho&s;e who &s;o mi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">al it, mu&s;t notwith&s;tanding allow it to be an irrational, or unimproving diver&s;ion; and that at the be&s;t it is but murdering time. But upon examination, every ob&s;erver may find, that dallying with the tempta|tion draws on imperceptibly to the mo&s;t de&s;tructive con|&s;equences. But what &s;hall be &s;aid of tho&s;e who take no delight in gaming, yet give into it on almo&s;t every occa|&s;ion? Surely complai&s;ance is a poor excu&s;e for doing a fooli&s;h or a wicked action, and that every game&s;ter is a knave or a fool, is a mo&s;t palpable truth. A certain no|bleman, hearing a gentleman &s;poken of, who was &s;aid to be a great game&s;ter: he is a mo&s;t incorrigible blockhead, cries my Lord. But on being a&s;&s;ured he was a man of very brilliant parts: if &s;o, replies my Lord, he mu&s;t be a rank &s;coundrel. Not &s;o, my Lord, replies the other, he bears the character of a gentleman of great worth and <HI>honour</HI> "That cannot be, retorts the nobleman; every game&s;ter is either a <HI>rogue</HI> or <HI>fool, pike</HI> or <HI>gudgeon;</HI> and hon|our never makes a nearer approach to the heart of &s;uch a one than the <HI>tip of his tongue."</HI></P>
<P>All conver&s;ation, all improvement, is put a &s;top to the moment gaming commences; friend&s;hip and &s;ociety, benevolence and humanity cea&s;e, and nothing further is thought of, but the ruin of tho&s;e you are in company with; the ruin of tho&s;e you often make the &s;tronge&s;t pro|te&s;tations of friend&s;hip to: the game&s;ter's happine&s;s (like the devil's) depends on the mi&s;ery of others; and, like Satan too, he &s;miles on tho&s;e whom in his heart he de|votes to de&s;truction.</P>
<P>The life of a game&s;ter is a life of uncertainty (con&s;e|quently of unhappine&s;s;) he can never properly call any thing his own, not being a&s;&s;ured of its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion one moment longer than till his next &s;itting down to the gaming table. The thriving game&s;ter, (how precarious is his thriving!) is the wor&s;t of robbers; and the unfor|tunate, the wor&s;t of &s;elf-murderers: a murderer who in|volves all tho&s;e innocents, who unfortunately have any

connection with him, in the di&s;mal gulph of beggery and wretched dependence.</P>
<P>If covetou&s;ne&s;s of another's property, and di&s;content with our own, be a breach of the divine command, <HI>"Thou &s;halt not covet thy neighbour's goods, &amp;c."</HI> the game|&s;ter is ever and &s;uperlatively guilty. The late Duke of <HI>A--------e,</HI> who had an aver&s;ion to all &s;orts of gaming, being urged to no purpo&s;e by a nobleman to &s;port a little money: <HI>Sure, my Lord,</HI> cries the nobleman, <HI>you mu&s;t love your money va&s;tly, to be afraid of venturing a trifle of it. It is true, my Lord,</HI> (replies his Grace) <HI>I do love my own money; yet no per&s;on had ever rea&s;on to &s;ay I was fond of another man's.</HI></P>
<P>The male part of mankind who give into this vice, pro&s;titute their talents to the mo&s;t vicious purpo&s;es; they become entirely ab&s;orbed by it; they &s;tand like &s;laves in the market, to be bought and &s;old; for nece&s;&s;ity often glares them in the face, and betrays them to venality.</P>
<P>If married, how can they reflect on the hazards they put the happine&s;s of wife, children, friends, &amp;c;. to? And when ill fortune &s;tares them in the face, how often are they &s;o cowardly as to have recour&s;e to a pi&s;tol, and by &s;uicide leave tho&s;e innocents to confront a dan|ger they them&s;elves were afraid of facing? But when gaming, &s;eizes the female brea&s;t, to all the above men|tioned mi&s;fortunes we may ju&s;tly add, <HI>lo&s;s of beauty,</HI> which is ever the con&s;equence of late hours, ruffled pa&s;&s;ions, and a corroding heart. Her honour, her cha&s;tity, can no longer be called her own, when &s;he commences game|&s;ter. The man&s;ion of gracefulne&s;s and beauty is con|verted into a foul and dark&s;ome dungeon. Attracting &s;oftne&s;s and mode&s;ty (the amiable characteri&s;tics of the &s;ex) are changed for unbecoming fiercene&s;s and acerbity of temper, and the whole picture brings to our mind the different &s;ituation and figure of <HI>Satan</HI> before and after the fall. The&s;e reflections (loo&s;e and undige&s;ted as they are) were occa&s;ioned by the two following relations, which lately happened and which probably &s;everal of my readers know to have but too much truth in them.</P>
<P>In one of the principal cities in <HI>England</HI> lived <HI>Lucius</HI> and <HI>Sapphira,</HI> ble&s;&s;ed with a moderate fortune. Health, love, peace of mind, and two little darlings, a &s;on and daughter. They &s;eemed to want for nothing as an ad|dition to their happine&s;s, nor were they in&s;en&s;ible of
<PB N="197" REF="029518_0099_0FE1CD6036CA5A18">
what they enjoyed; but with gratitude to Heaven, were in&s;truments of good to all about them. Towards the clo&s;e of la&s;t &s;ummer, <HI>Lucius</HI> happening to be in company with &s;ome neighbouring gentleman<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> who propo&s;ed to wa&s;te an hour or &s;o at cards, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, more in com|pliance to others' ta&s;te than his own. Like other &s;port|ers, he met with a variety of fortune, (a variety more &s;e|ducing than a continuance either of good or bad) and warmed with liquor, he was incon&s;iderately drawn in before the company broke up, to involve him&s;elf more than his fortune could bear. The next day, on &s;ober reflection, he could not &s;upport the thoughts of the di&s;|tre&s;s his folly had brought on his <HI>Sapphira</HI> and the little innocents; he had not courage to acquaint her with what had happened; and whil&s;t in the mid&s;t of pangs he had hitherto been a &s;tranger to, he was vi&s;ited again, and again tempted by one of the la&s;t night's company to try fortune once more. In order to drown reflection, and in hopes of recovering his lo&s;s, he flew to the fatal place, nor did he le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> it till he had lo&s;t his all. The con&s;equence of which was, that the next day, in de&s;pair inde&s;cribeable, after writing to acquaint <HI>Sapphira</HI> with what had happened, he &s;hot him&s;elf through the head; the news of which deprived <HI>Sapphira</HI> of her &s;en&s;es: &s;he is at pre&s;ent confined in a mad hou&s;e, and the two little innocents, de&s;titute of parents and fortune, have a trou|ble&s;ome world to &s;truggle through, and are likely to feel all the mi&s;eries that poverty and &s;ervile dependence en|tail on the wretched.</P>
<P>A young lady who lived in the North, was on the point of marriage with a young gentleman whom &s;he was doat|ingly fond of, and by whom &s;he was as greatly beloved: &s;he was at the &s;ame time admired by a per&s;on of high rank, but who&s;e pa&s;&s;ion, as he was already married, was con&s;equently di&s;honourable. He was determined, how|ever, at any rate to indulge his vicious flame; but as &s;he was a per&s;on of the &s;tricte&s;t honour, he was obliged to act cautiou&s;ly, and keep his love a &s;ecret. Knowing her propen&s;ity to gaming, he laid a &s;nare for her, into which &s;he fell, to the great diminution of her fortune. This he took care to have repre&s;ented with the mo&s;t aggrava|ting circum&s;tances to the gentleman to whom &s;he was engaged. His friends painted to him the dreadful in|convenience

of his taking a game&s;ter to wife: poverty, di&s;ea&s;e, and probably di&s;honour to his bed, were the like|ly con&s;equences; in a word, they managed matters &s;o as to break off the match. The villain who occa&s;ioned the breach between the lovers, notwith&s;tanding, mi&s;&s;ed his wicked ends; his addre&s;&s;es and propo&s;als met with con|tempt and abhorrence; yet though &s;he pre&s;erved her cha&s;tity, (a circum&s;tance very uncommon among female game&s;ters) the lo&s;s of her intended &s;pou&s;e, whom &s;he was di&s;tractedly fond of, threw her into a decline, which in a few months put an end to her life.</P>

<P>THE following is a letter from a father to his only &s;on, in which he lays open the dete&s;table crime of drunkenne&s;s, and its &s;hocking con&s;equences, in &s;triking colours.

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Tom,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>It is with the greate&s;t concern I hear you have lately (more than once) been guilty of getting fuddled in com|pany with &s;ome of your youthful companions; you can &s;carce think what a &s;hock this account gave me. I know, my dear boy, you have a great flow of &s;pirits, a lively imagination, and great good-nature; but tho&s;e qualities, in&s;tead of guarding you again&s;t that odious fault, are, I am afraid, mo&s;t likely to hurry you into it: other vices generally have their ri&s;e, and take deepe&s;t root in the meane&s;t di&s;po&s;itions. Drunkenne&s;s on the contrary, is often, too often ob&s;erved to flouri&s;h in the riche&s;t and mo&s;t promi&s;ing &s;oils: this, <HI>Tom,</HI> is a princi|pal rea&s;on why I feel for you. A &s;ocial good-natured youth is drawn in by degrees; if he is lively, &s;mart, and witty, his company is &s;ought for by others; if wit in another captivates him, the company he doats on draws him to the tavern, and though he &s;teps cautiou&s;ly at fir&s;t, he &s;oon, from habit and example, lo&s;es all &s;en&s;e of what he is doing; the &s;en&s;e of danger daily wears off; fond|ne&s;s
<PB N="199" REF="029518_0149_0FE2F6B8E07FA808">
for company by degrees draws on fondne&s;s for liquor; he becomes more &s;otti&s;h, and con&s;equently more &s;tupid, till at la&s;t his under&s;tanding, (an under&s;tanding that might have done honour to his country, and benefited his fellow-creatures) becomes clouded and muddled, and in&s;tead of the promi&s;ing expectations that his youth af|forded, he becomes a burden to him&s;elf, and de&s;picable to all the world.</P>
<P>Drunkenne&s;s, <HI>Tom,</HI> &s;tupifies the &s;en&s;es, de&s;troys the memory, blunts the under&s;tanding, fills men with di&s;ea&s;es, and makes them incapable of bu&s;ine&s;s of any kind: that this is the con&s;equence of habitual drunkenne&s;s, too ma|ny in&s;tances in every part of this kingdom will evidence. What a de&s;picable character that of a &s;ot is I need not de&s;cribe to you; and depend upon it, every per&s;on who is fond of the company of topers, is in a fair way of be|coming a &s;ot. If your inclination tends that way, check it immediately, nor deceive your&s;elf with the hopes of having the power to conquer it whenever you plea&s;e; in &s;uch a ca&s;e, habit daily adds new &s;trength to the vicious bent: the brute part of us (appetite) &s;oon po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the whole man, and rea&s;on, which may be called the angelic part, becomes quite &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">othered and de&s;troyed: you know, my lad, it is a common expre&s;&s;ion to &s;ay, He is as drunk as a bea&s;t. We do not &s;uppo&s;e that bea&s;ts get drunk; we mean by it, that man by inebriation drowns his under|&s;tanding; and when his rea&s;on is gone, he is upon a level with, nay really far beneath the brute, irrational creation. Brutes are certainly equally rational with &s;uch a wretch, if not more &s;o, with the &s;uperior advantage of a &s;ound body, and an in&s;tinct to guide them.</P>
<P>I am not afraid of your giving into vices which flow from an illiberal genius or &s;tupidity; as &s;wearing, for example, which &s;hews a barrenne&s;s of under&s;tanding, and a want of words; a want in reality of common &s;en&s;e in the bla&s;phemer. This, my dear boy, is far from being the ca&s;e with you at pre&s;ent; yet &s;hould you ever be|come an habitual drunkard, the company you mu&s;t then be often reduced to herd with, and the le&s;s of your un|der&s;tanding, will, you may depend upon it, bring on that &s;tupid vice as an additional od<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">m on your character.</P>
<P>I know the world is apt to laugh <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t the apprehen|&s;ion of any danger accruing from getting fuddled now
<PB N="200" REF="029518_0100_0FE1CE24ADC1E9B8">
and then; they think the con&s;equences innocent and trifling, but they &s;oon find them&s;elves wofully mi&s;taken. Getting fuddled is the high road to habitual drunken|ne&s;s; the oftener you are guilty of it, the more you pre|judice your health and under&s;tanding; and the le&s;s capable you are to guard again&s;t that abominable vice: it &s;teals upon you in&s;en&s;ibly, and you are &s;eldom con|&s;cious of the danger till you are incapable of re&s;i&s;ting it.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider, my dear lad, the fir&s;t deviation from the level paths of virtue, is the gradual imperceptible de&s;|cent: the entrance is bewitching, as it lies through the flowery regions of plea&s;ure; but as you advance, the way &s;oon becomes rougher and le&s;s plea&s;ing: the pro&s;pect by degrees grows dreary, gloomy, and frightful: each &s;tep you advance grows &s;teeper and &s;teeper; your power of re&s;i&s;tence grows fainter and fainter; and you are hur|ried down, in &s;pite of the feeble efforts you are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ca|pable of making, into the gulph of &s;hame and everla&s;ting de&s;truction.</P>
<P>A drunkard is the wor&s;t of &s;uicides; he is a deliber|ate, determined &s;elf murderer; he hurries him&s;elf out of the world; and for the &s;hort time he crawls on the earth, he makes him&s;elf mi&s;erable, by loading him&s;elf with racking di&s;tempers. Company, which he was &s;o fond of, avoid and de&s;pi&s;e him, when he can no longer contribute to their irrational mirth, (for you mu&s;t never tru&s;t to friend&s;hip commenced over a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">;) and the only faint glimmering of plea&s;ure he then enjoys, is when he is pouring down that liquid poi&s;on which fir&s;t occa&s;ioned, and &s;till increa&s;es his di&s;order.</P>
<P>A certain people among the ancient <HI>Greeks</HI> (the <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">rians,</HI> I think) puni&s;hed with double rigour any crime com|mitted in liquor; fir&s;t, and principally, for getting drunk; and, &s;econdly, for the crime committed: for certainly he who eradicates his rea&s;on deliberately, as drunkards do, is much more guilty of what is committed for want of that rea&s;on, de&s;troyed by his own fault, than he who&s;e rea&s;on is overcome by any accidental attack of pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>You &s;eem, <HI>Tom,</HI> to have &s;ome ambition in you, a laudable ambition, I hope, to di&s;tingui&s;h your&s;elf, and cut a figure in the world: all that, my dear boy, is over with you, if you once &s;uffer drunkenne&s;s to become your
<PB N="201" REF="029518_0100_0FE1CE24ADC1E9B8">
ma&s;ter: that emulation which might have made you illu&s;trious, will of cour&s;e be rever&s;ed into an aba&s;ement that mu&s;t degrade you below rationality; and &s;carce, as I have hinted before, leave you on a level with the lowe&s;t order of groveling brutes.</P>
<P>Whenever you hear any per&s;on brag in company (which drunkards generally do with great plea&s;ure and &s;elf-con&s;equence) that he got drunk, mo&s;t damnably drunk, &s;et that fellow down for a fool at the be&s;t. It is a fooli&s;h, nay a wicked way of priding him&s;elf, of what he &s;hould be a&s;hamed of. What then mu&s;t we think of company, who by their behaviour &s;eem to approve &s;uch folly; and as to the ridiculous cu&s;tom of drinking healths, nothing certainly can be a greater enemy to health than that is. I am &s;ure it were as ab&s;urd to ap|plaud a per&s;on for eating to exce&s;s, as for drinking to exce&s;s; they are equally de&s;picable, gluttonous, mean, and hoggish.</P>
<P>A man may enjoy company infinitely to more advan|tage in walking, riding, &amp;c;. than in a tavern over a bottle. Moderate exerci&s;e contributes to health and im|provement of the faculties; and conver&s;ation at &s;uch times mu&s;t be more edifying from the variety of &s;cenes that are continually pre&s;enting them&s;elves to the eye: or if the weather will not permit that, enjoy your&s;elf in your own or your friend's chamber, with an agreeable companion or two, which mu&s;t be much preferable to fuddling in a tavern, or an alehou&s;e; where the longer you remain, the le&s;s entertaining and improving mu&s;t the conver&s;ation be. Be&s;ides, I know you have a ta&s;te both for mu&s;ic and painting, and certainly any per&s;on &s;o en|dowed can never be at a lo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> for a plea&s;ing relaxation from &s;tudy. I am far, <HI>Tom,</HI> from being one of that rigid cla&s;s of mortals, who decay cheerfulne&s;s and mirth; I love mirth, you know I do: and cheerfulne&s;s (as the <HI>Spectator</HI> &s;ays) is the very health of the &s;oul; to pre&s;erve which, is one great rea&s;on why I would have you avoid drinking; for drinking is in reality an enemy to cheerfulne&s;s, good-nature, and mirth. In drinking, it is hard, nay almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible, to &s;top at a certain mark; and when you once go beyond it, you are hurried you know not whither; quarrelling, ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing, debauchery of all kinds, nay often murder are the dreadful fruits of drinking;
<PB N="202" REF="029518_0101_0FE1BA2201111DF8">
and in regard to conver&s;ation, <HI>Tom,</HI> I would appeal to your&s;elf, whether, from the little you have &s;een of drink|ing (I &s;incerely hope it is but little) whether in your cool moments you would not have been a&s;hamed of the words and actions which you applauded when warm with liquor: in a word, unle&s;s you mo&s;t carefully guard again&s;t drunkenne&s;s in your youth, it will in&s;en&s;ibly &s;teal on you; it will make you mi&s;erable both in body and mind; it will prove an in&s;uperable bar to your becom|ing eminent in any profe&s;&s;ion; it will make you odious to your&s;elf, and de&s;picable to others; it will afford a perpetual opening for the grand tempter to make you mi&s;erable both here and hereafter; and indeed, and in truth, I would rather hear of your being no more, than your becoming a drunkard.

It is to be ob&s;erved, the devil had before tempted him in vain to commit &s;ev|eral crimes; but the young fellow had hitherto with|&s;tood his temptations, and was &s;till determined to refu&s;e him in every thing but the one reque&s;t he was obliged by his contract to comply with: when it came to <HI>Beelzebub's</HI> turn to command, he left it to the youth's choice, either to murder his father, debauch his own &s;i&s;ter, or get drunk. The young man cho&s;e the la&s;t, as by far the lea&s;t &s;hock|ing; but when he had got drunk, the devil took that opportunity of tempting him (which till he was drunk he never could effectually do) to commit both the other crimes. Thus he was drawn in to commit all the devil wanted; whereas if either of the other had been his choice, he would probably have e&s;caped &s;o complicated guilt."</P>

<P>THERE was formerly a <HI>Santon,</HI> who&s;e name was <HI>Bar&s;i&s;a,</HI> who, for the &s;pace of an hundred years, very fre|quently applied him&s;elf to prayer; and &s;carce ever went out of the grotto in which he made his re&s;idence, for fear of expo&s;ing him&s;elf to the danger of offending God. He fa&s;ted in the day time, and watched in the night; all the inhabitants of the country had &s;o great a veneration for him, and &s;o highly valued his prayers, that they com|monly applied to him when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hey had any favours to beg of heaven. When he made vows for the health of a &s;ick per&s;on, the patient was immediately cured.</P>
<P>It happened that the daughter of the king of that country fell into a dangerous di&s;temper, the cau&s;e of which the phy&s;icians could not di&s;cover, yet they con|tinued pre&s;cribing remedies by gue&s;s; but in&s;tead of helping the Prince&s;s, they only augmented her di&s;ea&s;e. In the mean time, the King was incon&s;olable, for he pa&s;&s;ionately loved his daughter: wherefore one day, find|ing all human a&s;&s;i&s;tance vain, he declared it as his opinion, that the Prince&s;s ought to be &s;ent to the <HI>Santon Bar&s;i&s;a.</HI></P>
<P>All the <HI>Beys</HI> applauded his &s;entiment, and the King's officers conducted her to to the <HI>Santon;</HI> who, notwith&s;tand|ing his frozen age, could not &s;ee &s;uch a beauty, without being &s;en&s;ibly moved. He gazed on her with plea&s;ure; and the devil taking this opportunity, whi&s;pered in his ears thus "Oh, <HI>Santon!</HI> do not let &s;lip &s;uch a fortunate minute: tell the King's &s;ervants, that it is requi&s;ite for the Prince&s;s to pa&s;s this night in the grotto, to &s;ee whether it will plea&s;e God to cure her; that you will put up a prayer for her, and that they need only come to fetch her to-morrow.</P>
<P>How weak is man! the <HI>Santon</HI> followed the devil's advice, and did what he &s;ugge&s;ted to him. But the offi|cers, before they would yield to leave the Prince&s;s, &s;ent one of their number to know the King's plea&s;ure. That
<PB N="204" REF="029518_0102_0FE1CD61D92A2B50">
monarch, who had an entire confidence in <HI>Bar&s;i&s;a,</HI> never in the lea&s;t &s;crupled the tru&s;ting of his daughter with him. <HI>I con&s;ent, &s;aid he, that &s;he &s;tay with that holy man, and that he keep her as long as he plea&s;es: I am wholly &s;atisfied on that head.</HI></P>
<P>When the officers had received the King's an&s;wer, they retired, and the Prince&s;s remained alone with the Hermit. Night being come, the devil pre&s;ented him&s;elf to the <HI>San|ton,</HI> &s;aying, "Can&s;t thou let &s;lip &s;o favourable an oppor|tunity with &s;o charming a creature? Fear not her telling of the violence you offer to her; if &s;he were even &s;o indi&s;|creet as to reveal it, who will believe her? The court, the city, and all the world are too much prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in thy favour, to give any credit to &s;uch a report. You may do any thing unpuni&s;hed, when armed by the great reputa|tion for wi&s;dom which you have acquired." The unfor|tunate <HI>Bar&s;i&s;a</HI> was &s;o weak as to hearken to the enemy of mankind. He approached the Prince&s;s, took her into his arms, and in a moment cancelled a virtue of an hundred years duration.</P>
<P>He had no &s;ooner perpetrated the crime, than a thou|&s;and avenging horrors haunted him night and day. He thus acco&s;ted the devil: "Oh wretch, &s;ays he, it is thou who ha&s;t de&s;troyed me! thou ha&s;t encompa&s;&s;ed me for a whole age, and endeavoured to &s;educe me; and now thou ha&s;t at la&s;t gained thy end." "Oh. <HI>Santon!</HI> an&s;wered the devil, do not repro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ch me with the plea&s;ures thou ha&s;t enjoyed. Thou maye&s;t repent: but what is unhappy for thee is, that the Prince&s;s is impregnate, and thy &s;in will become public: thou wilt become the laughing-&s;tock of tho&s;e who admire and reverence thee at pre&s;ent, and the King will put thee to an ignominious death."</P>
<P><HI>Bar&s;i&s;a,</HI> terrified by this di&s;cour&s;e, &s;ays to the devil, "What &s;hall I do to prevent the publication of my &s;hame?" "To hinder the knowledge of your crime, you ought to commit a fre&s;h one, an&s;wered the devil. Kill the Prince&s;s, bury her in a corner of the grotto, and when the King's me&s;&s;engers come to-morrow, tell them you have cured her, and that &s;he went from the grotto very early in the morning: they will believe you, and &s;earch for her all over the city and country; and the King her father will be in great pain for her; but after &s;everal vain &s;earches, it will wear off."</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="029518_0102_0FE1CD61D92A2B50">
The Hermit, abandoned by God, pur&s;uant to this ad|vice; killed the Prince&s;s, buried her in a corner of the grotto, and the next day told the officers what the devil bade him &s;ay. They made diligent inquiry for the King's daughter; but not being able to hear of her, they de&s;paired of finding her, when the devil told them that all their &s;earches for the Prince&s;s were in vain; and relating what had pa&s;&s;ed betwixt her and the <HI>Santon,</HI> he told them the place where &s;he was interred. The officers immediately went to the grotto, &s;eized <HI>Bar&s;i&s;a,</HI> and found the Prince&s;s's body in the place to which the devil had directed them; whereupon they took up the corp&s;e, and carried it and the <HI>Santon</HI> to the palace.</P>
<P>When the King &s;aw his daughter dead, and was in|formed of the whole event, he broke out into tears and bitter lamentations; and a&s;&s;embling the doctors, he laid the <HI>Santon's</HI> crime before them, and a&s;ked their advice how he &s;hould be puni&s;hed. All the doctors condemn|ed him to death; upon which the gibbet was erected. When the Hermit went up the ladder, and was going to be turned off, the devil whi&s;pered in his ear the&s;e words, O <HI>Santon!</HI> if you will wor&s;hip me, I will extricate you out of this difficulty, and tran&s;port you two thou&s;and leagues from hence, into a country where you &s;hall be reverenced by men, as much as you were before this ad|venture." "I am content, &s;ays <HI>Bar&s;i&s;a;</HI> deliver me, and I will wor&s;hip thee." "Give me fir&s;t a &s;ign of adoration," replied the devil; whereupon the <HI>Santon</HI> bowed his head, and &s;aid, "I give my&s;elf to you." Then the devil rai&s;ing his voice, &s;aid, "O, <HI>Bar&s;i&s;a,</HI> I am &s;atisfied; I have obtained what I de&s;ired:" and with the&s;e words, &s;pitting in his face, he di&s;appeared; and the deluded <HI>Santon</HI> was hanged.</P>
<P>From this may be inferred, that evil thoughts will &s;ometimes &s;tart up even in the be&s;t of minds, which, when checked as &s;oon as noticed, can never be deemed crim|inal, but ought to be carefully &s;tified in <HI>embrio,</HI> as the fir&s;t incitements to &s;in; for vice naturally begets vice, and the lea&s;t digre&s;&s;ion from virtue is frequently &s;ucceed|ed by &s;uch a train of evils, as leads on imperceptibly to certain ruin.</P>

<P>BY which of the <HI>Indian</HI> &s;ages of antiquity the follow|ing &s;tory was written, or whether the people of the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> have any remote tradition upon which it is founded, is not known; but it was probably related in the fir&s;t per&s;on, to give it an air of greater dignity, and render its influence more powerful: nor would it, perhaps, appear altogether incredible to people among whom the <HI>Metemp&s;ycho&s;is</HI> is an article of faith, and the vi&s;ible agency of <HI>&s;uperior beings</HI> admitted without &s;cruple.</P>
<P><HI>Amurath,</HI> Sultan of the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> the judge of nations, the di&s;ciple of adver&s;ity, records the wonders of his life; let tho&s;e who pre&s;umptuou&s;ly que&s;tion the ways of Prov|idence, blu&s;h in &s;ilence and be wi&s;e, let the proud be humble, and obtain honour; and let the &s;en&s;ual reform<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> and be happy.</P>
<P>The angel of death clo&s;ed the eyes of the Sultan <HI>Abra|din,</HI> my father, and his empire de&s;cended to me in the eighteenth year of my age. At fir&s;t my mind was awed to humility, and &s;oftened with grief; I was in&s;en&s;ible to the &s;plendor of dominion; I heard the addre&s;&s;es of flat|tery with di&s;gu&s;t, and received the homage of dependent greatne&s;s with indifference. I had always regarded my father, not only with love, but reverence; and I was now perpetually recollecting in&s;tances of his tenderne&s;s, and reviewing the &s;olemn &s;cene, in which he recommended me to heaven in imperfect language, and gra&s;ped my hand in the agonies of death.</P>
<P>One evening, after having concealed my&s;elf all day in my chamber, I vi&s;ited his grave: I pro&s;trated my&s;elf on his tomb; &s;orrow overflowed my eyes, and devotion kindled in my bo&s;om. I felt my&s;elf, &s;uddenly &s;mitten on the &s;houlder as with a rod; and looking up, I per|ceived a man who&s;e eyes were piercing as light, and his beard whiter than &s;now. "I am, &s;aid he, the Genius <HI>Syndarac,</HI> the friend of thy father <HI>Abradin,</HI> who was the fear of his enemies, and the de&s;ire of his people; who&s;e &s;mile diffu&s;ed gladne&s;s like the lu&s;tre of the morning,
<PB N="207" REF="029518_0103_0FE1CD6376303140">
and who&s;e frown was dreadful as the gathering of a tempe&s;t: re&s;ign thy&s;elf to my influence, and thou &s;halt be like him." I bowed my&s;elf to the earth in token of gratitude and obedience, and he put a ring on the mid|dle finger of my left hand, in which I perceived a ruby of a deep colour and uncommon brightne&s;s. "This ring, &s;aid he, &s;hall mark out to thee the boundaries of good and evil; that, without weighing remote con&s;e|quences, thou maye&s;t know the nature and tendency of every action. Be attentive therefore to the &s;ilent admo|nition; and when the circle of gold &s;hall, by a &s;udden contraction, pre&s;s thy finger, and the ruby &s;hall grow pale, de&s;i&s;t immediately from what thou &s;halt be doing, and mark down that action in thy memory as a tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion of the rule of right: keep my gift as a pledge of happine&s;s and honour, and take it not off for a mo|ment." I received the ring with a &s;en&s;e of obligation which I &s;trove to expre&s;s, and an a&s;toni&s;hment that com|pelled me to be &s;ilent. The <HI>Genius</HI> perceived my confu|&s;ion, and turning from me with a &s;mile of complacency, immediately di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>During the fir&s;t moon I was &s;o cautious and circum|&s;pect, that the plea&s;ure of reflecting that my ring had not once indicated a fault, was le&s;&s;ened by a doubt of its virtue. I applied my&s;elf to the public bu&s;ine&s;s. My melancholy decrea&s;ed, as my mind was diverted to other objects; and, le&s;t the youth of my court &s;hould think that recreation was too long &s;u&s;pended, I appointed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eat the lion. But though I went out to the &s;port to gratify others rather than my&s;elf, yet my u&s;ual ardour returned in the field; I grew warm in the pur&s;uit, I con|tinued the chace, which was un&s;ucce&s;sful, too long, and returned fatigued and di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>As I entered the &s;eraglio, I was met by a little dog that had been my father's, who expre&s;&s;ed his joy at my return by jumping round me, and endeavouring to reach my hand: but as I was not di&s;po&s;ed to receive his care&s;&s;es, I &s;truck him, in the fretfulne&s;s of my di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;o &s;e|vere a blow with my foot, that it left him &s;carce power to crawl away, and hide him&s;elf under a &s;ofa in the cor|ner of the apartment. At this moment I felt the ring pre&s;s my finger, and looking upon the ruby, I perceived the glow of its colour abated.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="029518_0104_0FE1CD6F1B1AFAE8">
I was at fir&s;t &s;truck with &s;urpri&s;e and regret; but &s;ur|pri&s;e and regret quickly gave way to di&s;dain. "Shall not the Sultan <HI>Amurath,</HI> &s;aid I, to whom a thou&s;and kings pay tribute, and in who&s;e hand is the life of nations, &s;hall not <HI>Amurath</HI> &s;trike a dog that offends him, without being reproached for having tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the rule of right?" My ring again pre&s;&s;ed my finger, and the ruby became more pale: immediately the palace &s;hock with a bur&s;t of thunder, and the Genius <HI>Syndarac</HI> again &s;tood before me.</P>
<P><HI>"Amurath,</HI> &s;aid he, thou ha&s;t offended again&s;t thy bro|ther of the du&s;t; a being who, like thee, has received from the ALMIGHTY a capacity of plea&s;ure and pain: plea&s;ure which caprice is not allowed to &s;u&s;pend, and pain which ju&s;tice only has a right to inflict. If thou art ju&s;tified by power in afflicting inferior beings, I &s;hould be ju&s;tified in afflicting thee: but my power yet &s;pares thee, becau&s;e it is directed by the laws of &s;overeign good|ne&s;s, and becau&s;e thou maye&s;t yet be reclaimed by admo|nition. But yield not to the impul&s;e of quick re&s;ent|ment, nor indulge in cruelty the forwardne&s;s of di&s;gu&s;t, le&s;t by the laws of goodne&s;s I be compelled to afflict thee; for he that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> reproof, mu&s;t be reformed by puni&s;h|ment, or lo&s;t for ever."</P>
<P>At the pre&s;ence of <HI>Syndarac</HI> I was troubled, and his words covered me with confu&s;ion: I fell pro&s;trate at his feet, and heard him pronounce with a milder accent, "Expect not henceforth that I &s;hould an&s;wer the de|mands of arrogance, or gratify the curio&s;ity of &s;pecula|tion; confide in my friend&s;hip, and tru&s;t implicitly to thy ring."</P>
<P>As the chace had produced &s;o much infelicity, I did not repeat it, but invited my nobles to a banquet, and entertained them with dancing and mu&s;ic. I had given leave that all ceremony &s;hould be &s;u&s;pended, and that the company &s;hould treat me, not as a &s;overeign, but an equal, becau&s;e the conver&s;ation would otherwi&s;e be in|cumbered or re&s;trained; and I encouraged others to plea|&s;antry, by indulging the luxuriancy of my own imagin|ation. But though I affected to throw off the trappings of royalty, I had not &s;ufficient magnanimity to de&s;pi&s;e them. I enjoyed the voluntary deference which was paid me, and was &s;ecretly offended at <HI>Alibeg,</HI> my vi&s;ier,
<PB N="209" REF="029518_0104_0FE1CD6F1B1AFAE8">
who endeavoured to prevail upon the a&s;&s;embly to enjoy the liberty that had been given them, and was him&s;elf an example of the conduct that he recommended. I &s;ingled out as the object of my raillery the man who alone de&s;erved my approbation: he believed my conde|&s;cen&s;ion to be &s;incere, and imagined that he was &s;ecu|ring my favour by that behaviour which incurred my di&s;plea&s;ure; he was, therefore, grieved and confounded to perceive that I laboured to render him ridiculous and contemptible: I enjoyed his pain, and was elated at my &s;ucce&s;s; but my attention was &s;uddenly called to my ring, and I perceived the ruby change colour. I de&s;i&s;ted for a moment; but &s;ome of my courtiers having di&s;cov|ered and &s;econded my intention, I felt my vanity and re&s;entment gratified; I endeavoured to wa&s;h away the remembrance of my ring with wine; my &s;atire became more bitter, and <HI>Alibeg</HI> di&s;covered yet greater di&s;tre&s;s. My ring again reproached me; but I &s;till per&s;evered. The vi&s;ier was at length rou&s;ed to his defence; probably he had di&s;covered and de&s;pi&s;ed my weakne&s;s: his replies were &s;o poignant, that I became outrageous, and de|&s;cended from raillery to invectives: at length, di&s;gui&s;ing the angui&s;h of his mind with a &s;mile, "<HI>Amurath,</HI> &s;aid he, If the <HI>Sultan</HI> &s;hould know, that after having invited your friends to fe&s;tivity and merriment, you had a&s;&s;umed this authority, and in&s;ulted tho&s;e who were not aware that you di&s;dained to be treated with the familiarity of friend&s;hip, you would certainly fall under his di&s;plea&s;ure." The &s;everity of this &s;arca&s;m, which was extorted by long pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ocations from a man warmed with wine, &s;tung me with intolerable rage: I &s;tarted up, and &s;purning him from the table, was about to draw my poignard; when my at|tention was again called to my ring, and I perceived with &s;ome degree of regret, that the ruby had fallen almo&s;t to a perfect white.</P>
<P>But in&s;tead of being re&s;olved to be more watchful again&s;t whatever might bring me under the &s;ilent re|proof, I comforted my&s;elf, that the <HI>Genius</HI> would no more alarm me with his pre&s;ence. The irregularities of my conduct increa&s;ed almo&s;t imperceptibly, and the intima|tions of my ring became proportionably more frequent, though le&s;s forcible; till at la&s;t they were &s;o familiar, that I &s;carce remarked when they were given and when &s;u&s;pended.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="029518_0105_0FE1CD71E674A290">
It was &s;oon di&s;covered that I was plea&s;ed with &s;ervility; &s;ervility therefore was practi&s;ed, and I rewarded it &s;ome|times with a pen&s;ion, and &s;ometimes with a place. Thus the government of my kingdom was left to petty tyrants, who oppre&s;&s;ed the people to enrich them&s;elves. In the mean time I filled my &s;eraglio with women, among whom I abandoned my&s;elf to &s;en&s;uality, without enjoying the pure delight of that love which ari&s;es from e&s;teem. But I had not yet &s;tained my hands with blood, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> dared to ridicule the laws which I had neglected to fulfil.</P>
<P>My re&s;entment again&s;t <HI>Alibeg,</HI> however unju&s;t, was in|flexible, and terminated in the mo&s;t perfect hatred. I degraded him from his office; but I &s;till kept him at court, that I might embitter his life by perpetual indig|nities, and practi&s;e again&s;t him new &s;chem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of malevo|lence.</P>
<P><HI>Selima,</HI> the daughter of this Prince, had been intended by my father for my wife, and the marriage had been de|layed only by his death: but the plea&s;ure and the dig|nity that <HI>Alibeg</HI> would derive from this alliance had now changed with my purpo&s;e. Yet &s;uch was the beauty of <HI>Selima,</HI> that I gazed with de&s;ire; and &s;uch was her wit, that I li&s;tened with delight. I therefore re&s;olved, that I would, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;educe her to voluntary pro&s;titution; and that when her beauty &s;hould yield to the charms of variety, I would di&s;mi&s;s her with marks of di&s;grace. But in this attempt I could not &s;ucceed; my &s;olicitations were rejected &s;ometimes with tears, and &s;ometimes with reproaches. I became every day more wretched, by &s;eeking to bring calamities upon others; I con&s;idered my di&s;appointment as the triumph of a &s;lave, whom I wi&s;hed, but did not dare to de&s;troy; and I regarded his daugh|ter as the in&s;trument of my di&s;honour. Thus the ten|derne&s;s, which before had &s;haken my purpo&s;e, was weak|ened; my de&s;ire for beauty became <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;elfi&s;h and as &s;or|did an appetite, as my de&s;ire for foo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> and as I had no hope of obtaining the complete gratification of my lu&s;t and my revenge, I determined to enjoy <HI>Selima</HI> by force, as the only expedient to alleviate my torment.</P>
<P>She re&s;ided by my command in an apartment of the &s;eraglio, and I entered her chamber at midnight by a private door, of which I had the key; but with inex|pre&s;&s;ible vexation I found it empty. To be thus di&s;ap|pointed

in my la&s;t attempt, at the very moment in which I thought I had in&s;ured &s;ucce&s;s, di&s;tracted me with rage; and in&s;tead of returning to my chamber, and concealing my de&s;ign, I called for her women. They ran in pale and trembling; I demanded the lady; they gazed at me a&s;toni&s;hed and terrified, and then looking upon each other, &s;tood &s;ilent: I repeated my demand with fury and execration, and to enforce it, called aloud for the min|i&s;ters of death: they then fell pro&s;trate at my feet, and declared with one voice that they knew not where &s;he was; that they had left her, when they were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed for the night, &s;itting on a &s;ofa, pen&s;ive and alone; and that no per&s;on had &s;ince, to their knowledge, pa&s;&s;ed in or out of her apartment.</P>

<P>IN this account, however incredible, they per&s;i&s;ted without variation; and having filled the palace with alarm and confu&s;ion, I was obliged to retire, without gaining any intelligence by what means I had been baf|fled, or on whom to turn my re&s;entment.

But why &s;hould &s;he e&s;cape who had never been confined? If &s;he had de&s;ign|ed to departed, &s;he might have departed by day. Had &s;he an a&s;&s;ignation? And did &s;he intend to return, with|out being known to have been ab&s;ent? This &s;uppo&s;ition increa&s;ed my torment; becau&s;e, if it was true, <HI>Selima</HI> had granted to my &s;lave that which &s;he refu&s;ed to me. But as all the&s;e conjectures were uncertain, I determined to make her ab&s;ence a pretence to de&s;troy her father.</P>
<P>In the morning, I gave orders that he &s;hould be &s;eized and brought before me; but while I was yet &s;peaking, he entered, and pro&s;trating him&s;elf, thus anticipated my accu&s;ation: "May the <HI>Sultan Amurath,</HI> in who&s;e wrath the angel of death goes forth, rejoice for ever in the

I heard no more, but cried out, "Dare&s;t thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o mock me with a reque&s;t, to di&s;mi&s;s thy daughter whom thou ha&s;t &s;tolen?

<P>Though I was now convinced that <HI>Alibeg</HI> believed I had confined <HI>Selima,</HI> and decreed her death, yet I re&s;olved to per&s;i&s;t inquiring her in his hands; and therefore di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a repetition of my command, to pro|duce her with<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of death.</P>
<P>My ring, which during this &s;eries of events had given perpetual intimation of guilt, and which was always di&s;regarded, now pre&s;&s;ed my finger &s;o forcibly, that it gave me great pain, and compelled my notice. I imme|diately retired, and gave way to the di&s;content that &s;welled my bo&s;om. "How wretched a &s;lave is <HI>Amurath</HI> to an invi&s;ible tyrant! a being, who&s;e malevolence or envy has re&s;trained me in the exerci&s;e of my authority as a Prince, and who&s;e cunning has contrived perpetually to in&s;ult me, by intimating that every action of my life is a crime! how long &s;hall I groan under this intolerable oppre&s;&s;ion? This accur&s;ed ring is the badge and the in|&s;trument of my &s;ubjection and di&s;honour: he who gave it, is now perhaps in &s;ome remote region of the air; perhaps he rolls &s;ome planet in its orbit, agitates the &s;outhern ocean with a tempe&s;t, or &s;hakes &s;ome di&s;tant region with an earthquake: but wherever he is, he has &s;urely a more important employ than to watch my con|duct. Perhaps he has contrived this tali&s;man, only to re&s;train me from the enjoyment of &s;ome good, which he wi&s;hes to withhold; I feel that my de&s;ires are controuled; and to gratify the&s;e de&s;ires is to be happy." As I pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="5 letters">ed the&s;e words I drew off the ring, and threw it to the ground with di&s;dain and indignation: immediately the air grew dark; a cloud bur&s;t in thunder over my head, and the eye of <HI>Syndarac</HI> was upon me. I &s;tood be|fore him motionle&s;s and &s;ilent: horror thrilled in my

veins, and my hair &s;tood upright. I had neither power to deprecate his anger, nor to confe&s;s my faults. In his countenance there was a calm &s;erenity; and I heard him pronounce the&s;e words: "thou ha&s;t now, as far as is in thy own power, thrown off humanity, and degraded thy being; thy form therefore &s;hall no longer conceal thy nature. nor thy example render thy vices contagious." He then touched me with his rod; and while the &s;ound of his voice yet vibrated in my ears, I found my&s;elf in the mid&s;t of a de&s;art, not in the form of a man, but of a mon&s;ter, with the &s;ore parts of my body like a wolf, and the hinder parts like a goat. I was &s;till con&s;cious to every event of my life, and my intellectual powers were continued, though my pa&s;&s;ions were irritated to frenzy. I now rolled in the &s;and in an agony not to be de&s;cribed; and now ha&s;tily traver&s;ed the de&s;art, impelled only by the vain de&s;ire of flying from my&s;elf: I now bel|lowed with rage, and now howled in de&s;pair; this mo|ment I breathed execrations again&s;t the <HI>Genius,</HI> and the next reproached my&s;elf for having forfeited his friend|ship.</P>
<P>By this violent agitation of mind and body, the powers of both were &s;oon exhau&s;ted: I crawled into a den which I perceived near me, and immediately &s;unk down in a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility. I &s;lept; but &s;leep, in&s;tead of prolong|ing, put an end to this interval of quiet. The <HI>Genius</HI> &s;till terrified me with his pre&s;ence; I heard his &s;entence repeated, and felt again all the horrors of my transfor|mation. When I awaked, I was not refre&s;hed: calamity, though it compelled me to admit &s;lumber, yet could ex|clude fe&s;t. But I was now rou&s;ed with hunger; for hunger, like &s;leep, is irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>
<P>I went out in &s;earch of prey; and if I felt any allevia|tion of mi&s;ery, be&s;ides the hope of &s;atisfying my appe|tite, it was in the thought of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">earing to pieces whatever I &s;hould meet, and inflicting &s;ome part of the evil which I endured; for though I regretted my puni&s;hment. I did not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">epent of my crimes; and as I imagined <HI>Syndarac</HI> would now neither mitigate nor increa&s;e my &s;ufferings, I was not re&s;trained, either by hope or fear, from indulg|ing my di&s;po&s;ition to cruelty and revenge. But while I was thus meditating the de&s;truction of others, I trembled, left by &s;ome &s;tronger &s;avage I &s;hould be de&s;troyed my&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="029518_0107_0FE1CD752745D158">
In the mid&s;t of this variety of torment I heard the cry of dogs, the trampling of hor&s;es, and the &s;houts of the hunters, and &s;uch is the love of life, however wretched, that my heart &s;unk within me at the &s;ound. To hide my, &s;elf was impo&s;&s;ible, and I was too much enfeebled either to fly or re&s;i&s;t. I &s;tood &s;till till they came up. At fir&s;t they gazed at me with wonder, and doubted whether they &s;hould advance; but at length a &s;lave threw a net over me, and I was dragged to the city.</P>
<P>I now entered the metropolis of my empire, amid&s;t the noi&s;e and tumult of the rabble, who the day before would have hid them&s;elves at my pre&s;ence. I heard the &s;ound of mu&s;ic at a di&s;tance; the heralds approached and <HI>Alibe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> was proclaimed in my &s;tead. I was now de&s;erted by the multitude, who&s;e curio&s;ity was diverted by the pomp of the proce&s;&s;ion; and was conducted to the place where other &s;avages are kept, which cu&s;tom has con&s;idered as part of the regalia.</P>
<P>My keeper was a black &s;lave, whom I did not remember ever to have &s;een, in whom it would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> have been a fatal pre&s;umption to have &s;tood before me. After he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> given me food, and the vigour of nature was re&s;tored, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> covered in me &s;uch tokens of ferocity, that he &s;uffered me to fa&s;t many hours before I was again fed. I was &s;o en|raged at this delay, that, forgetting my dependence, I roared horribly when he again approached me; &s;o that he found it nece&s;&s;ary to add blows to hunger, that he might gain &s;uch an a&s;cendency over me as was, &s;uitable to his office. By this &s;lave, I was alternately beaten and fami&s;hed, till the fiercene&s;s of my di&s;po&s;ition being &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed by fear and langour, a mild temper in&s;en&s;ibly &s;tole upon me and a demeanor that was begun by con&s;traint was continued by habit.</P>
<P>I was now treated with le&s;s &s;everity, and &s;trove to expre&s;s &s;omething like gratitude, that might encourage my keeper to yet greater kindne&s;s. His vanity was flattered by my &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and, to &s;hew as well his courage as the &s;uc|ce&s;s of his di&s;cipline, he ventured &s;ometimes to care&s;s me in the pre&s;ence of tho&s;e who&s;e curio&s;ity brought them to &s;ee me. A kind of friend&s;hip thus imperceptibly grew between us, and I felt &s;ome degree of the affection I had feigned. It happened that a tyger which had been lately <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ken, broke one day into my den, while my keeper was

giving me my provi&s;ion, and leaping upon him, would in&s;tantly have torn him to pieces, if I had not &s;eized the &s;avage by the throat, and dragged him to the ground: the &s;lave in&s;tantly di&s;patched him with his dagger, and turned about to care&s;s his deliverer; but &s;tarting &s;uddenly backward, he &s;tood motionle&s;s with a&s;toni&s;hment, perceiv|ing that I was no longer a mon&s;ter, but a dog.</P>
<P>I was my&s;elf con&s;cious of the change which had again pa&s;&s;ed upon me, and leaping out of my den, e&s;caped from my confinement. This transformation I con&s;idered as a reward for my fidelity, and was perhaps never more hap|py than in the fir&s;t moments of my e&s;cape; for I reflected, that as a dog, my liberty was not only re&s;tored, but in|&s;ur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> I was no longer &s;u&s;pected of qualities which ren|dered me unfit for &s;ociety; I had &s;ome faint re&s;emblance of human virtue, which is not found in other animals, and therefore hoped to be more generally care&s;&s;ed. But it was not long before this joy &s;ub&s;ided in the remembrance of that dignity from which I had fallen, and from which I was &s;till at an immea&s;urable di&s;tance. Yet I lifted up my heart in gratitude to the power who had once more brought me within the circle of nature. As a brute, I was more thankful for a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">igation of puni&s;hment, than as a King I had been for offers of the highe&s;t happine&s;s and honor: and who, that is not taught by affliction, can ju&s;tly e&s;timate the bounties of heaven?</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the fir&s;t tumult of my mind was pa&s;t, I felt an irre&s;i&s;tible inclination once more to vi&s;it the apartments of my &s;eraglio. I placed my&s;elf behind an emir, whom I knew to have been the friend of <HI>Alibeg,</HI> and was permit|ted to follow him into the pre&s;ence. The per&s;ons and the place, the retro&s;pection of my life which they produced, and the compari&s;on of what I was with what I had been, almo&s;t over whelmed me. I went unob&s;erved into the garden, and lay down under the &s;hade of an almond-tree, that I might indulge tho&s;e reflections which, though they oppre&s;&s;ed me with melancholy, I did not wi&s;h to lo&s;e.</P>
<P>I had not been long in this place before a little dog, which I knew to be the &s;ame I had &s;purned from me when he care&s;&s;ed me at my return from hunting, came and fawned at my feet. My heart &s;mote me, and I &s;aid to my&s;elf, "Do&s;t thou know me under this di&s;gui&s;e? Is thy fidelity to thy Lord un&s;haken? Cut off as I am from

the conver&s;e of mankind, ha&s;t thou pre&s;erved for me an affection, which I once &s;o &s;lightly e&s;teemed, and requited with evil? This forgetfulne&s;s of injury, and this &s;teady friend&s;hip, are they le&s;s than human, or are they more?" I was not prevented by the&s;e reflections from returning tho&s;e care&s;&s;es that I received; and <HI>Alibeg,</HI> who ju&s;t entered the garden, took notice of me, and ordered that I &s;hould not be turned out.</P>
<P>In the &s;eraglio, I &s;oon learned, that a body which was thought to be mine was found dead in the chamber; and that <HI>Alibeg</HI> had been cho&s;en to &s;ucceed me, by the unani|mous voice of the people. But I gained no intelligence of <HI>Selima,</HI> who&s;e apartment I found in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of another, and for whom I had &s;earched every part of the palace in vain. I became re&s;tle&s;s; every place was irk|&s;ome; a de&s;ire to wander prevailed; and one evening I wont out at the garden-gate, and travelling till midnight, I lay down at the foot of a &s;ycamore tree and &s;lept.</P>
<P>In the morning, I beheld with &s;urpri&s;e a wall of marble that &s;eemed to reach to heaven, and gates that were &s;culptured with every emblem of delight. Over the gate was in&s;cribed in letters of gold, "Within this wall liberty is unbounded, and felicity complete: nature is not op|pre&s;&s;ed by the tyranny of religion, nor is plea&s;ure awed by the frown of virtue The gate is obedient to thy wi&s;h, who&s;oever thou art: enter therefore, and be happy."</P>
<P>When I read this in&s;cription, my bo&s;om throbbed with tumultuous expectation: but my de&s;ire to enter was repre&s;&s;ed by the reflection that I had lo&s;t the form in which alone I could gratify the appetites of a man. De&s;ire and curio&s;ity were notwith&s;tanding predominants, The door immediately opened inward: I entered, and it clo&s;ed after me.</P>

impre&s;&s;ed with the character of rage, of drunkenne&s;s, or of lu&s;t; rape and murder, revelling and &s;trife, filled every &s;treet and every dwelling.</P>
<P>As my retreat was cut off, I went forward with timidity and circum&s;pection; for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> imagined that I could not other|wi&s;e e&s;cape injury, than by eluding the notice of wretches who&s;e propen&s;ity to ill was re&s;trained by no law; and I perceived too late, that to puni&s;h vice is to promote hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>It was now evening; and that I might pa&s;s the night in greater &s;ecurity. I quitted the public way; and per|ceiving a hou&s;e that was incircled by a moat, I &s;wam over to it, and cho&s;e an ob&s;cure corner of the area for my a&s;ylum. I heard from within, the &s;ound of dancing and mu&s;ic; but after a &s;hort interval, was alarmed with the menaces of rage, the &s;hrieks of terror, and the wail|ings of di&s;tre&s;s. The window of the banquetting room flew open, and &s;ome veni&s;on was thrown out which fell ju&s;t at my feet. As I had eaten nothing &s;ince my depar|ture from the &s;eraglio, I regarded this as a fortunate ac|cident: and after the plea&s;ure of an unexpected repa&s;t, I again lay down in expectation of the morning, with hope and fear: but in a &s;hort time many per&s;ons ru&s;hed from the hou&s;e with lights, and &s;eemed &s;olicitons to gather up the veni&s;on which had been thrown out; but not being able to find it, and at the &s;ame time perceiving me, they judged I had devoured it. I was immediately &s;eized, and led into the hou&s;e: but as I could not di&s;cover that I was the object either of malignity or kindne&s;s, I was in a doubt what would be the i&s;&s;ue of the event. It was not long before this doubt was &s;olved; for I &s;oon learned from the di&s;cour&s;e of tho&s;e about me, that I was &s;u&s;pected to have eaten poi&s;on which had been intended for another, and was &s;ecured, that the effect might either remove or confirm the &s;u&s;picion. As it was not expected that the poi&s;on would immediately operate. I was locked up in a room by my&s;elf, where I reflected upon the cau&s;e and event of my confinement with inexpre&s;&s;ible angui&s;h, anxiety, and terror.</P>
<P>In this gloomy interval a &s;udden light &s;hone round me, and I found my&s;elf once more in the pre&s;ence of the <HI>Genius;</HI> I crawled towards him trembling and confound|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, but not utterly without hope. "Yet a few moments,

My blood grew chill as he &s;poke, I di&s;covered and abhorred my folly: but while I wi&s;hed to expre&s;s my contrition, I fell down in an agony; my eyes failed me, I &s;hivered, was convul&s;ed, and expired.</P>
<P>That &s;park of immaterial fire, which no violence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> quench, ro&s;e up from the du&s;t which had thus been re&s;tored to the earth, and now animated the form of a dove. On this new &s;tate of exi&s;tence I entered with in|expre&s;&s;ible delight: I imagined that my wings were not only a pledge of &s;afety, but of the favour of <HI>Syndarac</HI> whom I was now more than ever &s;olicitous to plea&s;e. I flew immediately from the window, and turning to|wards the wall through which I entered, I endeavoured to ri&s;e above it, that I might quit for ever a place in which guilt and wretchedne&s;s were complicated in every object, and which I now dete&s;ted as much as before I had de&s;ired. But over this region a &s;ulphurous vapour hovered like a thick cloud, which I no &s;ooner entered than I fell down panting for breath, and had &s;carce &s;trength to keep my wings &s;ufficiently extended to break my fall. It was now midnight, and I alighted near the mouth of a cave, in which I thought there appeared &s;ome faint glimmerings of light. Into this place I entered without much appre|hen&s;ion: as it rather appeared to be the retreat of pen|itence, than the rece&s;s of luxury: but le&s;t the noi&s;e of my wings &s;hould di&s;cover me to any hateful or mi&s;chiev|ous inhabitant of this gloomy &s;olitude, I entered in &s;ilence, and upon my feet. As I went forward the cave grew wider; and by the light of a lamp which was &s;u&s;|pended from the roof, I di&s;covered a Hermit li&s;tening to a young lady, who &s;eemed to be greatly affected with the events which &s;he was relating. Of the Hermit I had no knowledge; but the lady I di&s;cerned to be <HI>Selima.</HI> I was &s;truck with amazement at this di&s;covery; I remembered with the deepe&s;t contrition my attempts upon her virtue, and I now &s;ecretly rejoiced that &s;he had rendered them ineffectual: I watched her lips with the utmo&s;t impa|tience of curio&s;ity, and &s;he continued her narrative thus.</P>
<P>"I was &s;itting on a &s;ofa one evening, after I had been

Imme|diately a thick cloud &s;urrounded one; I felt my&s;elf lifted up, and conveyed through the air with incredible rapid|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y. I de&s;cended, the cloud di&s;&s;ipated, and I found my|&s;elf &s;itting in an alcove, by the &s;ide of a canal that en|circled a &s;tately edifice and a &s;pacious garden. I &s;aw many per&s;ons pa&s;s along; but di&s;covered in all either &s;omething di&s;&s;olute or wretched, &s;omething that alarmed my fear, or excited my pity. I &s;uddenly perceived ma|ny men with their &s;words drawn, contending for a woman, who was forced almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tibly by the crowd, which moved directly towards the place in which I was &s;itting. I was terrified, and looked round me with eagerne&s;s to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> where I could retreat for &s;afety. A per&s;on richly dre&s;&s;ed perceived my di&s;tre&s;s, and invited me into the hou&s;e, which the canal &s;urrounded. This invitation I ha&s;tily accepted with gratitude and joy; but I &s;oon re|marked &s;everal incidents which filled me with now per|plexity and apprehen&s;ion. I was welcomed to a place in which infamy and honour were equally unknown; where every wi&s;h was indulged without the violation of my law, and where the will was therefore determined only by appetite. I was pre&s;ently &s;urrounded by women, who&s;e behaviour covered me with blu&s;hes; and though I rejected the care&s;&s;es of the per&s;on into who&s;e power I was delivered, yet they became jealous of the di&s;tinction with which he treated me. My expo&s;tulations were not heard, and my tears were treated with merriment: prepara|tions were made for revelling and jollity: I was invited to join the dance, and upon my refu&s;al was entertained with mu&s;ic. In this dreadful &s;ituation, I &s;ighed thus to my&s;elf: how &s;evere is that ju&s;tice which tran&s;ports tho&s;e who form licentious wi&s;hes, to a &s;ociety in which they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> indulged without re&s;traint! who &s;hall deliver me from the effects of my own folly?

"As I renounced the pre&s;umptuous wi&s;h which had once polluted my mind, I exulted in this intimation with a&s;&s;urances of relief; and when &s;upper was &s;et before me, I &s;uffered the principal lady to &s;erve me with &s;ome veni&s;on; but the friendly voice having warned me that it was poi&s;oned, I fell back in my &s;eat, and turned pale: the lady inquired earne&s;tly what had di&s;ordered me; but in&s;tead of making a reply, I threw the veni&s;on from the window, and declared that &s;he had intended my death. The ma&s;ter of the table, who per|ceived that the lady to whom I &s;poke changed counte|nance, was at once convinced that &s;he had indeed at|tempted to poi&s;on me, to pre&s;erve that intere&s;t which as a rival &s;he feared I &s;hould &s;ubvert. He ro&s;e up in a rage, and commanded the veni&s;on to be produced: a dog that was &s;uppo&s;ed to have eaten it was brought in; but before the event could be known the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> was become general; and my rival, after having &s;uddenly &s;tabbed her patron, plunged the &s;ame poignard in her bo&s;om.</P>
<P>"In the mid&s;t of this confu&s;ion I found means to e&s;|cape, and wandered through the city in &s;earch of &s;ome ob&s;cure rece&s;s, where, if I received not the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which I hoped, death at la&s;t might &s;ecure my per&s;on from violence, and clo&s;e mine eyes on tho&s;e &s;cenes which, wherever I turned, filled me not only with di&s;gu&s;t, but with horror. By that benevolent power, who, as a pre|&s;ervative from mi&s;ery has placed in us a &s;ecret and irre&s;i&s;t|ible di&s;approbation of vice, my feet have been directed to thee, who&s;e virtue has participated in my di&s;tre&s;s, and who&s;e wi&s;dom may effect my deliverance."</P>
<P>I gazed upon <HI>Selima,</HI> while I thus learned the ardour of that affection which I had abu&s;ed, with &s;entiments that can never be conceived but when they are felt. I was touched with the mo&s;t bitter remor&s;e, for having produced one wi&s;h that could &s;tain &s;o amiable a mind; and abhorred my&s;elf for having u&s;ed the power which I derived from her tenderne&s;s, to effect her de&s;truction. My fondne&s;s was not le&s;s ardent, but it was more cha&s;te and tender; de&s;ire was not extingui&s;hed, but it was al|mo&s;t ab&s;orbed in e&s;teem. I felt a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, to which till now I had been a &s;tranger; and the moment love was kindled in my brea&s;t, I re&s;umed the proper form of the

At my &s;udden and unexpected ap|pearance, the colour faded from her cheeks, the powers of life were &s;u&s;pended, and &s;he &s;unk into my arms. I cla&s;ped her to my brea&s;t, and looking towards the Hermit for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I beheld in his &s;tead the friendly <HI>Genius</HI> who had taught me happine&s;s by affliction. At the &s;ame in&s;tant <HI>Selima</HI> recovered, "Ari&s;e, &s;aid <HI>Syndarac,</HI> and look round." We looked round; the darkne&s;s was &s;uddenly di&s;&s;ipated, and we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">received our&s;elves in the road to <HI>Gol|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">onda,</HI> and the &s;pires of the city &s;parkling before us. "Go, &s;aid he, <HI>Amurath,</HI> henceforth the hu&s;band of <HI>Selima,</HI> and the father of thy people! I have revealed thy &s;tory to <HI>Alibeg</HI> in a vi&s;ion: he expects thy return, and the cha|riots are come out to meet thee. Go, and I will pro|claim before thee, <HI>Amurath</HI> the Sultan of the Ea&s;t, the judge of nations, the taught of heaven: <HI>Amurath,</HI> who&s;e ring is equal to the ring of <HI>Colomon,</HI> returns to reign with wi&s;dom, and diffu&s;e felicity." I now lifted up my eyes, and beheld the chariots coming forward. We were re|ceived by <HI>Alibeg</HI> with &s;entiments which could not be ut|tered, and by the people with the loude&s;t acclamations: <HI>Syndarac</HI> proclaimed our return in thunder, that was heard through all the nations of my empire; and has prolonged my reign in pro&s;perity and peace.</P>

<P>ON the fifth day of the moon, which, according to the cu&s;tom of my forefathers, I always kept holy,
<PB N="222" REF="029518_0111_0FE1CD98A9414780">
after having wa&s;hed my&s;elf, and offered up my morning devotions, I a&s;cended the high hills of <HI>Bagdad,</HI> in order to pa&s;s the re&s;t of the day in meditation and prayer. As I was there airing my&s;elf on the top of the mountains, I fell into a profound contemplation on the vanity of hu|man life; and pa&s;&s;ing from one thought to another, Surely, &s;aid I, man is but a &s;hadow, and life a dream. Whil&s;t I was thus mu&s;ing, I ca&s;t my eye towards the &s;ummit of a rock that was not far from me, where I di&s;|covered one in the habit of a &s;hepherd, with a mu&s;ical in&s;trument in his hand. As I looked upon him, he ap|plied it to his lips, and began to play upon it. The &s;ound of it was exceeding &s;weet, and wrought into a vari|ety of tones that were inexpre&s;&s;ibly melodious, and alto|gether different from any thing I had ever heard. This put me in mind of tho&s;e heav'nly airs that are played to the departed &s;ouls of good men upon their fir&s;t arrival in Paradi&s;e, to wear out the impre&s;&s;ions of their agonies, and to qualify them for the plea&s;ures of that happy play. My heart melted away in &s;ecret rapture.</P>
<P>I had often been told that the rock before me was the haunt of a Genius; and that &s;everal had been entertain|ed with mu&s;ic who had pa&s;&s;ed by it, but never heard that the mu&s;ician had before made him&s;elf vi&s;ible. When he had rai&s;ed my thoughts by tho&s;e tran&s;porting air which he played, to ta&s;te the plea&s;ures of his conver&s;ation, as I looked upon him like one a&s;toni&s;hed, he beckoned to me, and by the waving of his hand directed me to ap|proach the place where he &s;at. I drew near with that reverence which is due to a &s;uperior nature; and as my heart was entirely &s;ubdued by the captivating &s;trains I had heard, I fell down at his feet, and wept. The Genius &s;miled upon me with a look of compa&s;&s;ion and affability, that familiarized him to my imagination, and at once di&s;pelled all the fears and apprehen&s;ions with which I approached him. He lifted me from the ground, and taking me by the hand, <HI>Mirza,</HI> &s;aid he, I have heard thee in thy &s;oliloquies, follow me&punc;</P>
<P>He then led me to the highe&s;t pinnacle of the rock, and placed me on the top of it: ca&s;t thine eye ea&s;tward, &s;aid he, and tell me what thou &s;ee&s;t. I &s;ee, &s;aid I, a huge valley, and a prodigious tide of water rolling through it. The valley that thou &s;ee&s;t, &s;aid he, is the vale of mi&s;ery;
<PB N="223" REF="029518_0111_0FE1CD98A9414780">
and the tide of water that thou &s;ee&s;t is part of the great tide of eternity. What is the rea&s;on, &s;aid I, that the tide I &s;ee rises out of a thick mi&s;t at one end, and again <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;es it&s;elf in a thick mi&s;t at the other?

I &s;ee a bridge, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> I &s;tanding in the mid&s;t, of the tide. The bridge thou &s;ee&s;t, &s;aid he, is human life; con&s;ider it at|tentively. Upon a more deliberate &s;urvey of it, I found that it con&s;i&s;ted of three&s;core and ten entire arches, with &s;everal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rches, which added to tho&s;e that were entire, ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> to the number about an hundred. As I was counting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, the Genius told me, that this bridge con&s;i&s;ted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of a thou&s;and arches; but that a great flood &s;wept <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the re&s;t, and left the bridge in the ruin|ous condition I now beheld it. But tell me further, &s;aid he, what that di&s;covere&s;t on it. I &s;ee multitudes of people pa&s;&s;ing over it, &s;aid I, and a black cloud hanging on each end of it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. As I looked more attentively, I &s;aw &s;everal of the pa&s;&s;engers dropping through the bridge into the great tide that flowed under it; and, upon further examination, perceived there were innumerable trap-doors that lay concealed in the bridge, which the pa&s;&s;engers no &s;ooner trode upon, but they fell through them into the tide, and immediately di&s;appeared. The&s;e hidden pit-falls were &s;et very thick at the entrance of the bridge, &s;o that throngs of people no &s;ooner broke through the cloud, but many of them fell into them. They grew thinner towards the middle, but multiplied and lay clo&s;er towards the end of the arches that were entire.</P>
<P>There were indeed &s;ome per&s;ons, but their numbers were very &s;mall, that continued a kind of hobbling march on the broken arches, but fell through one after another, being quite tired and &s;pent with &s;o long a walk.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time in the contemplation of this won|derful &s;tructure and the great variety of objects which it pre&s;ented. My heart was filled with a deep melancholy, to &s;ee &s;everal dropping unexpectedly in the mid&s;t of mirth and jollity, and catching at every thing that &s;tood by them to &s;ave them&s;elves. Some were looking upwards
<PB N="224" REF="029518_0112_0FE1CD87D3889858">
towards the heavens in a thoughtful po&s;ture, and in the mid&s;t of a &s;peculation &s;tumbled and fell out of &s;ight. Multitudes were very bu&s;y in the pro&s;pect of bubbles that glittered in their eyes, and danced before them; but often, when they thought them&s;elves within the reach of them, their footing failed, and down they &s;unk. In this confu&s;ion of objects, I ob&s;erved &s;ome with &s;cyme|ters in their hands, and others with urinals, who ran to and fro upon the bridge, thru&s;ting &s;everal per&s;ons on trap-doors, which did not &s;olem to lie in their way, and which they might have e&s;caped had they not thus been forced upon them.</P>
<P>The Genius &s;eeing me indulge my&s;elf in this melan|choly pro&s;pect, told me I had dwelt long enough upon it: take thine eye off the bridge, &s;aid he and tell me if thou &s;ee&s;t any thing thou do&s;t not comprehend. Upon look|ing up, What mean, &s;aid I, the&s;e great flights of birds that are perpetually hovering about the bridge, and &s;et|tling upon it, from time to time? I &s;ee vultures, harpies, ravens, cormorants, and among many other feathered creatures, &s;everal little winged boys, that perch in great numbers upon the middle arches. The&s;e, &s;aid the Ge|nius, are envy, avarice, &s;uper&s;tition, de&s;pair, love, with the like cares and pa&s;&s;ions that infe&s;t human life.</P>
<P>I here fetched a deep &s;igh: alas, &s;aid I, man was made in vain! how is he given away to mi&s;ery and mortality, tortured in life, and &s;wallowed up in death! the Genius being moved with compa&s;&s;ion towards me, bid me quit to uncomfortable a pro&s;pect. Look no more, &s;aid he, on man in the fir&s;t &s;tage of his exi&s;tence, in his &s;etting out for eternity; but ca&s;t thine eye on that thick mi&s;t into which the tide bears the tide bears the &s;everal generations of mor|tals that fall into it. I directed my &s;ight as I was order|ed, and (whether or not the good Genius &s;trengthened it with any &s;upernatural force, or di&s;&s;ipated part of the mi&s;t that was before too thick for the eye to penetrate) I &s;aw the valley opening at the further end, and &s;preading forth into an immen&s;e ocean, that had a huge rock of adamant running through the mid&s;t of it, and dividing it into two equal parts. The clouds &s;till re&s;ted on one half of it, in&s;omuch that I could di&s;cover nothing in it: but the other appeared to me a va&s;t ocean, planted with innumerable i&s;lands that were covered with fruits and
<PB N="225" REF="029518_0112_0FE1CD87D3889858">
flowers, and interwoven with a thou&s;and little &s;hining &s;eas that ran among them. I could &s;ee per&s;ons dre&s;&s;ed in glorious habits, with garlands upon their heads, pa&s;|&s;ing among the trees, lying down by the &s;ides of foun|tains, or re&s;ting on beds of flowers: and could hear a confu&s;ed harmony of &s;inging birds, falling waters, hu|man voices, and mu&s;ical in&s;truments. Gladne&s;s grew in me upon the di&s;covery of &s;o delightful a &s;cene. I wi&s;hed for the wings of an eagle that I might fly away to tho&s;e happy &s;eas: but the Genius told me there was no pa&s;|&s;age to them, except through the gates of death, that I &s;aw opening every moment upon the bridge. The i&s;lands, &s;aid he, that lie &s;o fre&s;h and green before thee, and with which the whole face of the ocean appears &s;potted as far as thou can&s;t &s;ee, are more in number than the &s;ands of the &s;ea &s;hore. There are myriads of i&s;lands beyond tho&s;e which thou here di&s;covere&s;t reach|ing farther than thine eye, or even thine imagination can extend it&s;elf. The&s;e are the man&s;ions of good men after death, who, according to the degrees and kinds of virtue in which they excelled, are di&s;tributed among tho&s;e &s;everal i&s;lands, which abound with plea&s;ures of different kinds and degrees, &s;uitable to the reli&s;hes and perfections of tho&s;e who are &s;ettled in them: every i&s;land is a paradi&s;e accommodated to its re&s;pective inhab|itants. Are not the&s;e, O <HI>Mirza,</HI> habitations worth con|tending for? Does life appear mi&s;erable, that gives thee opportunities of earning &s;uch a reward? Is death to be feared, that will convey thee to &s;o happy an exi&s;tence? Think not man was made in vain, who has &s;uch an eter|nity re&s;erved for him. I gazed with inexpre&s;&s;ible plea|&s;ure on the&s;e happy i&s;lands. At length, &s;aid I, &s;hew me now, I be&s;eech thee, the &s;ecrets that he hid under tho&s;e dark clouds which cover the ocean on the other &s;ide of the rock of adamant. The Genius making me no an|&s;wer, I turned about to addre&s;s my&s;elf to him a &s;econd time, but I found that he had left me; I then turned again to the vi&s;ion which I had been &s;o long contempla|ting, but in&s;tead of the rolling tide, the arched bridge, and the happy i&s;lands, I &s;aw nothing but the low hollow valley of <HI>Bagdad,</HI> with oxen, &s;heep, and camels grazing upon the &s;ides of it.</P>

<P>IT has been ob&s;erved by many writers, that nothing makes a more ridiculous figure in a man's life, than the di&s;parity we often find in him, &s;ick and well. Thus one of an unfortunate con&s;titution is perpetually exhibit|ing a mi&s;erable example of the weakne&s;s of his mind, or of his body, in their turns. I have had frequent opportu|nities of late to con&s;ider my&s;elf in the&s;e different views, and hope I have received &s;ome advantage by it. If what Mr. <HI>Waller</HI> &s;ays be true, that

Youth, at the very be&s;t, is but a betrayer of human life in a gentler and &s;moother manner than age. It is like a &s;tream that nouri&s;hes a plant upon its bank, and cau&s;es it to flouri&s;h and blo&s;&s;om to the &s;ight, but at the &s;ame time is undermining it at the root in &s;ecret.

<P>I HAD lately a very remarkable dream, which made &s;o &s;trong an impre&s;&s;ion on me, that I remember it every word; and if you are not better employed, you may read the relation of it as follows:</P>
<P>Methought I was in the mid&s;t of a very entertaining &s;et of company, and extremely delighted in attending to a lively conver&s;ation; when on a &s;udden I perceived one of the mo&s;t &s;hocking figures imagination can frame, ad|vancing towards me. She was dre&s;&s;ed in black; her &s;kin was contracted into a thou&s;and wrinkles; her eyes deep &s;unk in her head; and her complexion pale and livid as the countenance of death. Her looks were filled with terror and unrelenting &s;everity; and her hands armed with whips and &s;corpions. As &s;oon as &s;he came near with a horrid frown, and a voice that chilled my very,
<PB N="228" REF="029518_0114_0FE1CD9D915B9698">
blood, &s;he bade me follow her. I obeyed; and &s;he led me through rugged paths, be&s;et with briars and thorns, into a deep &s;olitary valley. Wherever &s;he pa&s;&s;ed, the fading verdure withered beneath her &s;teps, her pe&s;tilen|tial breath infected the air with malignant vapours, ob|&s;cured the lu&s;tre of the &s;un, and involved the fair face of heaven in univer&s;al gloom. Di&s;mal howlings re&s;ound|ed through the fore&s;t; from every baleful tree the night-raven uttered his dreadful note, and the pro&s;pect was filled with de&s;olation and horror. In the mid&s;t of this tremendous &s;cene, my execrable guide addre&s;&s;ed me in the following manner:</P>
<P>"Retire with me, O ra&s;h, unthinking mortal! from the vain allurements of a deceitful world, and learn that plea&s;ure was not de&s;igned the portion of human life. Man was born to mourn and to be, wretched: this is the condition of all below the &s;tars; and whoever en|deavours to oppo&s;e it, acts in contradiction to the will of heaven. Fly then from the fatal inchantments of youth and &s;ocial delight, and here con&s;ecrate the &s;olitary hours to lamentation and woe. Mi&s;ery is the duty of all &s;ub|lunary beings; and every enjoyment is an offence to the Deity, who is to be wor&s;hipped only by the mortification of every &s;en&s;e of plea&s;ure, and the everla&s;ting exerci&s;e of &s;ighs and tears."</P>
<P>This melancholy picture of life quite &s;unk my &s;pirits, and &s;eemed to annihilate every principle of joy within me. I threw my&s;elf beneath a bla&s;ted yew, where the winds blew cold and di&s;mal round my head, and dreadful appre|hen&s;ions chilled my heart. Here I re&s;olved to lie till the hand of death, which I impatiently invoked, &s;hould put an end to the mi&s;eries of a life &s;o deplorably wretched. In this &s;ad &s;ituation, I e&s;pied on one hand of me a deep muddy river, who&s;e heavy waves rolled on in &s;low, &s;ullen murmurs. Here I determined to plunge; and was ju&s;t upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rink, when I found my&s;elf &s;uddenly drawn back. I turned about, and was &s;urpri&s;ed by the &s;ight of the lovelie&s;t object I had ever beheld. The mo&s;t engaging charms of youth and beauty appeared in all her form; effulgent glories &s;parkled in her eyes, and their awful &s;plendors were &s;oftened by the gentle&s;t looks of compa&s;&s;ion and peace. At her approach, the frightful &s;pectre, who had before tormented me, vani&s;hed away, and with her

all the horrors &s;he had cau&s;ed. The gloomy clouds brightened into cheerful &s;un&s;hine, the groves recovered their verdure, and the whole region looked gay and blooming as the garden of <HI>Eden.</HI> I was quite tran&s;port|ed at this unexpected change, and reviving plea&s;ure be|gan to gladden my thoughts; when, with a look of in|expre&s;&s;ible &s;weetne&s;s, my beauteous deliverer thus uttered her divine in&s;tructions:</P>
<P>"My name is <HI>Religion.</HI> I am the offspring of <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Love,</HI> and the parent of <HI>Benevolence, Hope,</HI> and <HI>Joy.</HI> That mon&s;ter, from who&s;e power I have freed you, is called <HI>Super&s;tition:</HI> &s;he is the child of <HI>Di&s;content,</HI> and her followers are <HI>Fear</HI> and <HI>Sorrow.</HI> Thus, different as we are, &s;he has often the in&s;olence to a&s;&s;ume my name and character, and &s;educes unhappy mortals to think us the &s;ame, till &s;he at length drives them to the borders of de&s;|pair, that dreadful aby&s;s into which you were ju&s;t going to &s;ink.</P>
<P>"Look round, and &s;urvey the various beauties of this globe, which heaven has de&s;tined for the &s;eat of the hu|man race; and con&s;ider whether a world, thus exqui&s;itely framed, could be meant for the abode of mi&s;ery and pain. For what end has the lavi&s;h hand of Providence diffu&s;ed &s;uch innumerable objects of delight, but that all might rejoice in the priviledge of exi&s;tence, and be filled with gratitude to the beneficent Author of it? Thus to enjoy the ble&s;&s;ings he has &s;ent, is virtue and obedience; and to reject them merelyas means of plea&s;ure, is pitiable ignorance, or ab&s;urd perver&s;ene&s;s. Infinite goodne&s;s is the &s;ource of created exi&s;tence. The proper tendency of every rational being, from the highe&s;t order of raptured &s;eraphs, to the meane&s;t rank of men, is to ri&s;e ince&s;&s;antly from lower degrees of happine&s;s to higher. They have each faculties a&s;&s;igned them for various orders of delights."</P>
<P>"What! (cried I) is this the language of <HI>religion?</HI> Does &s;he lead her votaries through flowery paths, and bid them pa&s;s an unlaborious life? Where are the pain|ful toils of virtue, the mortifications of penitents, and the &s;elf-denying exerci&s;es of &s;aints and heroes?"</P>
<P>"The true enjoyments of a rea&s;onable being (an&s;wered &s;he, mildly) do not con&s;i&s;t in unbounded indulgence, or luxurious ea&s;e, in the tumult of pa&s;&s;ions, the languor of indolence, or the flutter of light amu&s;ements. Yielding

to immoral plea&s;ure corrupts the mind; living to ani|mal and trifling ones, deba&s;es it; both in their degrees di&s;qualify it for its genuine good, and con&s;ign it over to wretchedne&s;s. Whoever would be really happy, mu&s;t make the diligent and regular exerci&s;e of his &s;uperior powers his chief attention; adoring the perfections of his Maker, expre&s;&s;ing good-will to his fellow-creatures, and cultivating inward rectitude. To his lower faculties he mu&s;t allow &s;uch gratifications as will, by refre&s;hing them, invigorate his nobler pur&s;uits. In the regions in|habited by angelic natures, unmingled felicity for ever blooms; joy flows there with a perpetual and abundant &s;tream, nor needs there any mound to check its cour&s;e. Beings con&s;cious of a frame of mind originally di&s;ea&s;ed, as all the human race has cau&s;e to be, mu&s;t u&s;e the regi|men of a &s;tricter &s;elf-government. Whoever has been guilty of voluntary exce&s;&s;es, mu&s;t patiently &s;ubmit both to the painful workings of nature, and needful &s;everities of medicines, in order to his cure. Still he is entitled to a moderate &s;hare of whatever alleviating accommodations this fair man&s;ion of his merciful Purent affords, con&s;i&s;t|ent with his recovery. And in proportion as his recov|ery advances, the livelie&s;t joy will &s;pring from his &s;ecret &s;en&s;e of an amended and improved heart. So far from the horrors of de&s;pair is the condition even of the guilty. Shudder, poor mortal, at the thought of the gulph into which thou wa&s;t ju&s;t now going to plunge.</P>
<P>"While the mo&s;t faulty have every encouragement to mend, the more innocent &s;oul will be &s;upported with &s;till &s;weeter con&s;olations under all its experience of hu|man infirmities; &s;upported by the gladdening a&s;&s;urances, that every &s;incere endeavour to outgrow them &s;hall be a&s;&s;i&s;ted, accepted, and rewarded. To &s;uch a one, the lowe&s;t &s;elf-aba&s;ement is but a deep-laid foundation for the mo&s;t elevated hopes; &s;ince they who faithfully exam|ine and acknowledge what they are, &s;hall be enabled, under my conduct, to become what they de&s;ire. The Chri&s;tian and the hero are in&s;eparable; and to the a&s;pi|rings of una&s;&s;uming tru&s;t and filial confidence, are &s;et no bounds. To him who is animated with a view of obtain|ing approbation from the Sovereign of the univer&s;e, no difficulty is in&s;urmountable. Secure in his pur&s;uit of every needful aid, his conflict with the &s;evere&s;t pains and

trials is little more than the vigorous exerci&s;es of a mind in health. His patient dependence on that Providence which looks through all eternity, his &s;ilent re&s;ignation, his ready accommodation of his thoughts and behaviour to its in&s;crutable ways, is at once the mo&s;t excellent &s;ort of &s;elf-denial, and &s;ource of the mo&s;t exalted tran&s;ports. Society is the true &s;phere of human virtue. In &s;ocial active life, difficulties will perpetually be met with; re|&s;traints of many kinds will be nece&s;&s;ary; and &s;tudying to behave right in re&s;pect of the&s;e, is a di&s;cipline of the hu|man heart, u&s;eful to others, and improving to it&s;elf. Suffering is no duty, but where it is nece&s;&s;ary to avoid guilt, or to do good; nor plea&s;ure a crime, but where it &s;trengthens the influence of bad inclinations, or le&s;&s;ens the generous activity of virtue. The happine&s;s allotted to man in his pre&s;ent &s;tate, is indeed faint and low, com|pared with his immortal pro&s;pects and noble capacities: but yet, whatever portion of it the di&s;tributing hand of heaven offers to each individual, is a needful &s;upport and refre&s;hment for the pre&s;ent moment, &s;o far as it may not hinder the attaining his final de&s;tination.</P>
<P>"Return then with me from continual mi&s;ery, to mod|erate enjoyment, and grateful alacrity; return from the contracted views of &s;olitude, to the proper duties of a rel|ative and dependent being. <HI>Religion</HI> is not confined to cells and clo&s;ets, nor re&s;trained to &s;ullen retirement. The&s;e are the gloomy doctrines of <HI>&s;uper&s;tition,</HI> by which &s;he endeavours to break tho&s;e chains of benevolence and &s;ocial affection, that link the welfare of every particular with that of the whole. Remember, that the greate&s;t honour you can pay the Author of your being, is &s;uch a cheerful behaviour as di&s;covers a mind &s;atisfied with his own di&s;pen&s;ations."</P>
<P>Here my preceptre&s;s pau&s;ed; and I was going to ex|pre&s;s my acknowledgments for her di&s;cour&s;e, when a ring of bells from the neighbouring village, and the newly-ri&s;en &s;un darting his beams through my windows awaked me.</P>

<P>I am the &s;on of the younger brother of a good family, who at his decea&s;e left me a little fortune of a hundred a year. I was put early to <HI>Eaton</HI> &s;chool, where I learned <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek,</HI> from whence I went to the Univer&s;ity,
<PB N="233" REF="029518_0116_0FE1CDABAF9B0300">
where I learned not totally to forget them. I came to my fortune when I was at the college; and having no inclination to follow any profe&s;&s;ion, I removed my&s;elf to town, and lived for &s;ome time, as mo&s;t young fellows do, by &s;pending four times my income. But it was my hap|pine&s;s, before it was too late, to fall in love with, and marry a very amiable young creature, who&s;e fortune was ju&s;t &s;ufficient to repair the breach made in my own. With this agreeable companion I retreated to the country, and endeavoured, as well as I was able, to &s;quare my wi&s;hes to my circum&s;tances. In this endeavour I &s;uc|ceeded &s;o well, that, excepting a few private hankerings after a little more than I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and now and then a &s;igh when a coach and &s;ix happened to drive by me in my walks, I was a happy man.</P>
<P>I can truly a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, that though our family-economy was not much to be boa&s;ted of, and in con&s;e|quence of it we were frequently driven to great &s;traits and difficulties, I experienced more real &s;atisfaction in this humble &s;ituation, than I have ever done &s;ince in more enviable circum&s;tances. We were &s;ometimes in|deed a little in debt, but when money came in, the plea|&s;ure of di&s;charging what we owed was more than an equiv|alent for the&s;e pains it put us to; and though the nar|rowne&s;s of our circum&s;tances &s;ubjected us to many cares and anxieties, it &s;erved to keep the body in action as well, as the mind: &s;or as our garden was &s;omewhat large, and required more hands to keep it in order than we could afford to hire, we laboured daily in it our&s;elves, and drew health from our nece&s;&s;ities.</P>
<P>I had a little boy, who was the delight of my heart, and who probably might have been &s;poiled by nur&s;ing, if the attention of his parents had not been otherwi&s;e employed. His mother was naturally of a &s;ickly con&s;ti|tution, but the affairs of her family, as they engro&s;&s;ed all her thoughts, gave her no time for complaint. The ordinary troubles of life, which to tho&s;e who have noth|ing el&s;e to think of, are almo&s;t in&s;upportable, were le&s;s terrible to us than to per&s;ons of ea&s;ier circum&s;tances; for it is a certain truth, however your readers may plea&s;e to receive it, that where the mind is divided among ma|ny cares, the anxiety is lighter than when there is only one to contend with. Or even in the happie&s;t &s;ituation,
<PB N="234" REF="029518_0117_0FE1CDAD544FCC70">
in the mid&s;t of ea&s;e, I health, and affluence, the mind is generally ingenious at tormenting it&s;elf, lo&s;ing the im|mediate enjoyment of tho&s;e invaluable ble&s;&s;ings, by the painful &s;ugge&s;tion that they are too great for continu|ance.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the reflections that I have made &s;ince; for I do not attempt to deny that I &s;ighed frequently for an addition to my fortune. The death of a di&s;tant relation, which happened five years after our marriage, gave me this addition, and made me for a time the happie&s;t man living. My income was now increa&s;ed to &s;ix hundred a year; and I hoped, with a little oeconomy, to be able to make a figure with it. But the ill health of my wife, which in le&s;s ea&s;y circum&s;tances had not touched me &s;o nearly, was now con&s;tantly in my thoughts, and &s;oured all my enjoyment. The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s too of having &s;uch an e&s;tate to leave my boy, made me &s;o anxious to pre|&s;erve hire, that in&s;tead of &s;uffering him to run at plea|&s;ure when he plea&s;ed, and to grow hardy by exerci&s;e, I almo&s;t de&s;troyed him by confinement. We now did nothing in our garden, becau&s;e we were in circum&s;tances to have it kept by others: but as the air and exerci&s;e were nece&s;&s;ary for our healths, we re&s;olved to abridge our&s;elves in &s;ome unnece&s;&s;ary articles, and &s;et up an equi|page. This in time brought with it a train of expences, which we had neither prudence to fore&s;ee, nor courage to prevent. For as it enabled us to extend the circuit of our vi&s;its, it greatly increa&s;ed our acquaintance, and &s;ubjected us to the nece&s;&s;ity of making continual enter|tainments at home, in return for all tho&s;e to which we were invited abroad. The charges that attended this new manner of living were much too great for the in|come we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; in&s;omuch that we found our&s;elves in a very &s;hort time more nece&s;&s;itous than ever. Pride would not &s;uffer us to lay down our equipage; and to live in a manner &s;uitable to it, was what we could not bear to think of. To pay the debts I had contracted, I was &s;oon forced to mortgage, and at la&s;t to &s;ell the be&s;t part of my e&s;tate; and as it was utterly impo&s;&s;ible to keep up the parade any longer, we thought it advi&s;eable to remove of a &s;udden, to &s;ell our coach in town, and to look out for a new &s;ituation, at a greater di&s;tance from our ac|quaintance.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="029518_0117_0FE1CDAD544FCC70">
But, unfortunately for my peace, I carried the habit of expence along with me, and was very near being re|duced to ab&s;olute want, when, by the unexpected death of an uncle and his two &s;ons, who died within a few weeks of each other, I &s;ucceeded to an e&s;tate of &s;even thou&s;and pounds a year.</P>
<P>And now, Sir, both you and your readers will call me a very happy man; and &s;o indeed I was; I &s;et about the regulation of my family with the mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;atisfac|tion: the &s;plendour of my equipages, the magnificence of my plate, the crowd of &s;ervants that attended me, the elegance of my hou&s;e and furniture, the grandeur of my park and gardens, the luxury of my table, and the court that was every where paid me, gave me inexpre&s;&s;ible de|light, &s;o long as they were novelties, but no &s;ooner were they become habitual to me, than I lo&s;t all manner of reli&s;h for them; and di&s;covered, in a very little time, that by having nothing to wi&s;h for, I had nothing to enjoy. My appetites grew pallid by &s;atiety, a perpetual crowd of vi&s;itors robbed me of all dome&s;tic enjoyment, my &s;er|vants plagued me, and my &s;teward cheated me.</P>
<P>But the cur&s;e of greatne&s;s did not end here. Daily ex|perience convinced me that I was compelled to live more for others than for my&s;elf. My uncle had been a great party man, and a zealous oppo&s;er of all mini&s;terial mea|&s;ures; as his e&s;tate was the large&s;t of any gentleman in the county, he &s;upported an intere&s;t in it beyond any of his competitors. My father had been greatly obliged by the court party, which determined me, in gratitude, to declare my&s;elf on that &s;ide; but the difficulties I had to encounter were too many and too great for me; in&s;o|much that I have been baffled and defeated in almo&s;t every thing I have undertaken. To de&s;ert the cau&s;e I have embarked in, would di&s;grace me; and to go great|er lengths in it will almo&s;t undo me. I am engaged in a perpetual &s;tate of warfare with the principal gentry of the county, and am cur&s;ed by my tenants and dependants, for compelling them at every election to vote (as they are plea&s;ed to tell me) contrary to their con&s;ciences.</P>
<P>My wife and I once plea&s;ed our&s;elves with the thoughts of being u&s;eful to the neighbourhood, by dealing out our charity to the poor and Indu&s;trious; but the perpet|ual hurry in which we live, renders us incapable of look|ing
<PB N="236" REF="029518_0118_0FE1CDAEF0637380">
out for objects our&s;elves; and the agents we entru&s;t are either pocketing our bounty, or be&s;towing it upon the unde&s;erving. At night, when we retire to re&s;t, we are venting our complaints on the mi&s;eries of the day, and praying heartily for the return of that peace, which was the only companion of our humble&s;t &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Where pain, &s;ickne&s;s, and ab&s;olute want are out of the que&s;tion, no external change of circum&s;tances can make a man more la&s;tingly happy than he was before. It is to an ignorance of this truth, that the univer&s;al di&s;&s;atisfac|tion of mankind is principally to be a&s;cribed. Care is the lot of life; and he that a&s;pires to greatne&s;s, in hopes to get rid of it, is like one who throws him&s;elf into a fur|nace to avoid the &s;hivering of an ague.</P>
<P>The only &s;atisfaction I can enjoy in my pre&s;ent &s;ituation is, that it has not plea&s;ed heaven in its wrath to make me a King.</P>

<P>A CERTAIN <HI>Cardinal,</HI> who for the multitude of his generous actions was &s;tyled the Patron of the Poor, had a con&s;tant cu&s;tom, once or twice a week, to give public audience to all indigent people in the hall of his palace, and to relieve every one according to their various nece&s;&s;ities, or the motives of his own bounty.</P>
<P>One day a poor woman, encouraged by the fame of his genero&s;ity, came into the hall of this <HI>Cardinal</HI> with her only daughter, a beautiful maid about fifteen years of age.

is, that you would be plea&s;ed to interpo&s;e your &s;acred authority, and protect us from the violence of this cruel man, till by our hone&s;t indu&s;try we can procure the money for him."</P>
<P>The <HI>Cardinal,</HI> moved with admiration of the woman's virtue and innocent mode&s;ty, bid her be of good courage. Then he immediately wrote a billet, and giving it into the widow's hands, "Go, &s;aid he, to my &s;teward with this paper, and he &s;hall deliver thee five crowns to pay the rent."</P>
<P>The poor woman overjoyed, and returning the <HI>Cardinal</HI> a thou&s;and thanks, went directly to the &s;teward, and gave him the note; which, when he had read, he told her out fifty crowns.

<P>On the other hand, the &s;teward in&s;i&s;ted on his ma&s;ter's order, not daring to call it in que&s;tion.

FLAVILLA, ju&s;t as &s;he had entered her fourteenth year, was left an orphan to the care of her mother, in &s;uch circum&s;tances as di&s;appointed all the hopes which her education had encouraged. Her father, who lived in great elegance upon the &s;alary of a place at court, died &s;uddenly, without having made any provi&s;ion for his family, except an annuity of one hundred pounds, which he had purcha&s;ed for his wife with part of her marriage portion; nor was he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any property, except the furniture of a large hou&s;e in one of the &s;quares, an equip|age, a few jewels, and &s;ome plate.</P>
<P>The greater part of the furniture and the equipage were &s;old to pay his debts; the jewels, which were not of great value, and &s;ome u&s;eful pieces of the plate, were re&s;erved; and <HI>Flavilla</HI> removed with her mother into lodgings.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding this change in their circum&s;tances, they did not immediately lo&s;e their rank. They were &s;till vi&s;ited by a numerous and polite acquaintance; and though &s;ome gratified their pride, by a&s;&s;uming an appear|ance of pity, and rather in&s;ulted than alleviated their di&s;tre&s;&s;es by the whine of condolence, and a minute com|pari&s;on of what they had lo&s;t with what they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; yet from others they were continually receiving pre&s;ents, which &s;till enabled them to live with a genteel frugality; they were &s;till con&s;idered as people of fa&s;hion, and treated by tho&s;e of a lower cla&s;s with di&s;tinct re&s;pect.</P>
<P><HI>Flavilla</HI> thus continued to move in a &s;phere to which &s;he had no claim; &s;he was remarkably tall for her age, and was celebrated not only for her beauty, but her wit: the&s;e qualifications &s;he con&s;idered, not only as &s;ecuring whatever &s;he enjoyed by the favour of others, but as a pledge of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them in her own right by an advanta|geous marriage.</P>
<P>There was a fa&s;hionable levity in her carriage and di&s;|cour&s;e, which her mother, who knew the danger of her &s;ituation, laboured to re&s;train, &s;ometimes with anger, and &s;ometimes with tears, but always without &s;ucce&s;s. <HI>Flavilla</HI> was ever ready to an&s;wer, That &s;he neither did nor &s;aid any thing of which &s;he had rea&s;on to be a&s;hamed; and therefore did not know why &s;he &s;hould be re&s;trained, except in mere courte&s;y to envy, which it was an honor to provoke; or to &s;lander which it was a di&s;grace to fear.
<PB N="239" REF="029518_0119_0FE1CDB0940D2DC0">
In proportion as <HI>Flavilla</HI> was more flattered and care&s;&s;ed, the influence of her mother became le&s;s; and though &s;he always treated her with re&s;pect from a point of good-breeding, yet &s;he &s;ecretly de&s;pi&s;ed her maxims, and applauded her own conduct.</P>
<P><HI>Flavilla</HI> at eighteen was a celebrated toa&s;t; and among other gay vi&s;itants who frequented her tea table was <HI>Clodio,</HI> a young Baronet, who had ju&s;t taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his title and e&s;tate. There were many particulars in <HI>Clodio'</HI>s be|haviour, which encouraged <HI>Flavilla</HI> to hope that &s;he &s;hould obtain him for a hu&s;band; but &s;he &s;uffered his a&s;&s;iduities with &s;uch apparent plea&s;ure, and his familiari|ties with &s;o little re&s;erve, that he &s;oon ventured to di&s;clo&s;e his intention, and make her what he thought, a very genteel propo&s;al of another kind: but, whatever were the artifices with which it was introduced, or the terms in which it was made, <HI>Flavilla</HI> rejected it with the utmo&s;t indignation and di&s;dain. <HI>Clodio,</HI> who notwith&s;tanding his youth, had long known, and often practi&s;ed the art &s;eduction, gave way to the &s;torm, threw him&s;elf at her feet, imputed his offence to the frenzy of his pa&s;&s;ion, flattered her pride by the mo&s;t abject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and extravagant prai&s;e, intreated her pardon, aggravated his crime, but made no mention of atonement by marriage. This particular, which <HI>Flavilla</HI> did not fail to remark, ought to have determined her to admit him no more: but her vanity and her ambition were &s;till predominant, &s;he &s;till hoped to &s;ucceed in her project. <HI>Clodio's</HI> offence was tacitly forgiven, his vi&s;its were permitted, his familiarities were again &s;uffered, and his hopes revived. He had long entertained an opinion that &s;he loved him, in which, however, it is probable, that his own vanity and her in|di&s;cretion concurred to deceive him; but this opinion, though it implied the &s;tronge&s;t obligation to treat her with genero&s;ity and tenderne&s;s, only determined him again to attempt her ruin, as it encouraged him with a probability of &s;ucce&s;s. Having therefore re&s;olved to ob|tain her as a mi&s;tre&s;s, or at once to give her up, he thought he had little more to do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">han to convince her that he had taken &s;uch a re&s;olution, ju&s;tifying it by &s;ome plau&s;i|ble &s;ophi&s;try, and give her &s;ome time to deliberate upon a final determination. With this view he went a &s;hort journey into the country; having put a letter into her
<PB N="240" REF="029518_0120_0FE1CDBE1DE68A80">
hand at parting, in which he acquainted her, "That he had often reflected, with inexpre&s;&s;ible regret upon her re&s;entment to his conduct in a late in&s;tance; but that the delicacy and the ardour of his affections were in&s;uperable ob&s;tacles to his marriage. That where there was no liberty there could be no happine&s;s: that he &s;hould become in|different to the endearments of love, when it could no longer be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the officiou&s;ne&s;s of duty: that while they were happy in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of each other, it would be ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e they would part: and if this happine&s;s &s;hould cea&s;e, it would not only en&s;ure, but aggravate their mi&s;ery to be in&s;eparably united: that this event was le&s;s probable, in proportion as their cohabita|tion was voluntary; but that he would make &s;uch provi|&s;ion for her upon the contingency, as a wife would expect upon his death."</P>
<P><HI>Flavilla</HI> had too much under&s;tanding as well as virtue to deliberate a moment upon this propo&s;al. She gave immediate orders that <HI>Clodio</HI> &s;hould be admitted no more. But his letter was a temptation to gratify her vanity, which &s;he could not re&s;i&s;t; &s;he &s;hewed it fir&s;t to her mother, and then to the whole circle of her female acquaintance, with all the exultation of a hero who expo&s;es a vanqui&s;hed enemy at the wheels of his chariot in triumph; &s;he con|&s;idered it as an indi&s;putable evidence of her virtue, as a reproof to all who had dared to cen&s;ure the levity of her conduct, and a licence to continue it without apology or re&s;traint.</P>
<P>It happened that <HI>Flavilla,</HI> &s;oon after this accident, was &s;een in one of the boxes of the play-hou&s;e by <HI>Mercator,</HI> a young gentleman who had ju&s;t returned from his fir&s;t voyage, as a captain of a large &s;hip in the <HI>Levant</HI> trade, which had been purcha&s;ed for him by his father, who&s;e fortune enabled him to make a genteel provi&s;ion for five &s;ons, of whom <HI>Mercator</HI> was the younge&s;t, and who expected to &s;hare his e&s;tate, which was per&s;onal, in equal proportion at his death.</P>
<P><HI>Mercator</HI> was captivated with her beauty, but di&s;cour|aged by the &s;plendor of her appearance, and the rank of her company. He was urged, rather by curio&s;ity than hope, to inquire who &s;he was; and he &s;oon gained &s;uch a knowledge of her circum&s;tances, as relieved him from de&s;pair.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="029518_0120_0FE1CDBE1DE68A80">
As he knew not how to get admi&s;&s;ion into her company, and had no de&s;ign upon her virtue, he wrote in the fir&s;t ardour of his pa&s;&s;ion to her mother; giving a faithful account of his fortune and dependence, and intreating that he might be permitted to vi&s;it <HI>Flavilla,</HI> as a candi|date for her affections. The old lady, after having made &s;ome inquiries, by which the account that <HI>Mercator</HI> had given her was confirmed, &s;ent him an invitation, and received his fir&s;t vi&s;it alone. She told him, that as <HI>Fla|villa</HI> had no fortune, and as a con&s;iderable part of his own was dependent upon his father's will, he ought therefore to obtain his con&s;ent before any other &s;tep was taken. To this coun&s;el, &s;o &s;alutary, <HI>Mercator</HI> was he&s;itating what to reply, when <HI>Flavilla</HI> came in, an acci|dent which he was now only &s;olicitous to improve. <HI>Fla|villa</HI> was not di&s;plea&s;ed either with his per&s;on or addre&s;s; the frankne&s;s and gaiety of her di&s;po&s;ition &s;oon made him forget that he was a &s;tranger; a conver&s;ation com|menced, during which they became yet more plea&s;ed with each other; and having thus &s;urmounted the diffi|culties of a fir&s;t vi&s;it, he thought no more of the old lady, as he believed her au&s;pices were not nece&s;&s;ary to his &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>His vi&s;its were often repeated, and he became every hour more impatient of delay: a thought of his father would now and then indeed intervene; but being deter|mined to gratify his wi&s;hes at all events, he concluded with a &s;agacity almo&s;t univer&s;al upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, that of two evils, to marry without his con&s;ent, was le&s;s than to marry again&s;t it; and one evening, after the lovers had &s;pent the afternoon by them&s;elves, they went out in a kind of frolic, which <HI>Mercator</HI> had propo&s;ed in the vehemence of his pa&s;&s;ion, and to which <HI>Flavilla</HI> had con&s;ented in the giddine&s;s of her indi&s;cretion, and were married at <HI>May-Fair.</HI></P>
<P>In the fir&s;t interval of recollection after this precipi|tate &s;tep, <HI>Mercator</HI> con&s;idered, that he ought to be the fir&s;t who acquainted his father of the new alliance which had been made in his family. But as he had not forti|tude enough to do it in per&s;on, he expre&s;&s;ed it in the be&s;t terms he could conceive by a letter; and after &s;uch an apology for his conduct as he had been u&s;ed to make for him&s;elf, he reque&s;ted that he might be permitted to
<PB N="242" REF="029518_0121_0FE1CDBB765633B8">
pre&s;ent his wife for the parental benediction, which alone was wanting to complete his felicity.</P>
<P>The old gentleman, who&s;e character I cannot better expre&s;s than in the fa&s;hionable phra&s;e which has been contrived to palliate fal&s;e principles and di&s;&s;olute man|ners, had been a gay man, and was well acquainted with the town. He had often heard <HI>Flavilla</HI> toa&s;ted by rakes of quality, and had often &s;een her at public places. Her beauty and her dependence, the gaiety of her dre&s;s, and the multitude of her admirers, the levity of her conduct, and all the circum&s;tances of her &s;ituation, had concurred to render her character &s;u&s;pected; and he was di&s;po&s;ed to judge of it with le&s;s charity, when &s;he had offended him by marrying his &s;on, whom he con&s;idered as di&s;gra|ced and impoveri&s;hed, and who&s;e misfortune, as it was irretrievable, he re&s;olved not to alleviate, but increa&s;e; a re&s;olution by which fathers, who have fooli&s;h and di&s;|obedient &s;ons, u&s;ually di&s;play their own kindne&s;s and wi&s;do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; As &s;oon as he had read <HI>Mercator's</HI> letter, he cur&s;ed him for a fool, who had been gulled by the artifice of a &s;trumpet, to &s;creen her from public infamy, by fath|ering her children, and &s;ecuring her from a pri&s;on by appropriating her debts. In an an&s;wer to his letter, which he wrote only to gratify his re&s;entment, he told him, that "if he had taken <HI>Flavilla</HI> into keeping, he would have overlooked it; and if her extravagance had di&s;tre&s;&s;ed him, he would have &s;atisfied his creditors; but that his marriage was not to be forgiven; that he never &s;hould have another &s;hilling of his money; and that he was determined to &s;ee him no more."</P>
<P><HI>Mercator,</HI> who was more provoked by this outrage than grieved at his lo&s;s, di&s;dained to reply; and believing that he had now mo&s;t rea&s;on to be offended, could not be per&s;uaded to &s;olicit a reconciliation.</P>
<P>He hired a genteel apartment for his wife of an uphol|&s;terer, who, with a view to let lodgings, had taken and furni&s;hed a large hou&s;e near <HI>Leice&s;ter Fields,</HI> and in about two months left her to make another voyage.</P>
<P>He had received vi&s;its of congratulation from her nu|merous acquaintance, and had returned them, as a pledge of his de&s;ire that they &s;hould be repeated. But a remem|brance of the gay multitude, which while he was at home had flattered his vanity, as &s;oon as he was ab&s;ent
<PB N="243" REF="029518_0121_0FE1CDBB765633B8">
alarmed his &s;u&s;picion: he had, indeed, no particular cau&s;e of jealou&s;y; but his anxiety aro&s;e merely from a &s;en&s;e of the temptations to which &s;he was expo&s;ed, and the impo&s;&s;ibility of his &s;uperintending her conduct.</P>
<P>In the mean time, <HI>Flavilla</HI> continued to flutter round the &s;ame giddy circle in which &s;he had &s;hone &s;o long; the number of her vi&s;itants was rather increa&s;ed than dimini&s;hed; the gentlemen attended her with greater a&s;&s;iduity, and &s;he continued to encourage their civilities by the &s;ame indecent familiarity: &s;he was one night at the ma&s;querade, and another at the opera; &s;ometimes at a rout, and &s;ometimes rambling in a party of plea&s;ure in &s;hort excur&s;ions from town; &s;he came home &s;ome|times at midnight, &s;ometimes in the morning, and &s;ometimes &s;he was ab&s;ent &s;everal nights together.</P>
<P>This conduct was the cau&s;e of much &s;peculation and unea&s;ine&s;s to the good man and good woman of the hou&s;e. At fir&s;t they &s;u&s;pected that <HI>Flavilla</HI> was no bet|ter than a woman of plea&s;ure; and that the per&s;on who had hired the lodgings for her as his wife, (and had di&s;|appeared upon pre&s;ence of going a voyage to &s;ea) had been employed to impo&s;e upon them, by concealing her character, in order to obtain &s;uch accommodations for her as &s;he could not &s;o ea&s;ily have procured had it been known: but as the&s;e &s;u&s;picions made them watchful and inqui&s;itive, they &s;oon di&s;covered, that many ladies by whom &s;he was vi&s;ited were of good character and fa&s;hion. Her conduct, however, &s;uppo&s;ing her to be a wife, was &s;till inexcu&s;able, and &s;till endangered her credit and &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence: hints were often dropped by the neighbours to the di&s;advantage of her character; and an elderly maiden lady, who lodged in the &s;econd floor, had given warning; the family was di&s;turbed at all hours of the night, and the door was crowded all day with me&s;&s;engers and vi&s;itants to <HI>Flavilla.</HI></P>
<P>One day, therefore, the good woman took an opportu|nity to remon&s;trate, though in the mo&s;t di&s;tant and re&s;|pectful terms, and with the utmo&s;t diffidence and caution, &s;he told <HI>Flavilla,</HI> "That &s;he was a fine young lady; that her hu&s;band was abroad; that &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a great deal of company; and that the world was cen&s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ious: &s;he wi&s;hed that le&s;s occa&s;ion for &s;candal was given; and ho|ped to be excu&s;ed the liberty &s;he had taken, as &s;he might
<PB N="244" REF="029518_0122_0FE1CDBFC10D7860">
be ruined by tho&s;e &s;landers which could have no influ|ence upon the great, and which therefore, they were not &s;olicitous to avoid."</P>
<P>This addre&s;s, however ambiguous, and however gen|tle, was ea&s;ily under&s;tood, and fiercely re&s;ented.<HI>Flavilla,</HI> proud of her virtue, and impatient of controul, would have de&s;pi&s;ed the coun&s;el of a philo&s;opher, if he had im|plied an impeachment of her conduct: before a per&s;on &s;o much her inferior, therefore, &s;he was under no re|&s;traint; but an&s;wered with a mixture of contempt and indignation, "That tho&s;e only who did not know her would dare to take any liberty with her character; and warned her to propagate no &s;candalous report, at her peril." <HI>Flavilla</HI> immediately ro&s;e from her &s;eat, and the woman departed without reply, though &s;he was &s;carce le&s;s offended than her lodger; and from that moment &s;he determined when <HI>Mercator</HI> returned, to give her warn|ing.</P>
<P><HI>Mercator's</HI> voyage was pro&s;perous, and after an ab&s;ence of about ten months, he came back. The woman, to whom her hu&s;band left the whole management of the lodgings, and who per&s;i&s;ted in her purpo&s;e, &s;oon found an opportunity to put it in execution.<HI>Mercator,</HI> as his part of the contract had been punctually fulfilled, thought he had &s;ome cau&s;e to be offended, and in&s;i&s;ted to know her rea&s;ons for compelling him to leave her hou&s;e. The&s;e, his ho&s;te&s;s, who was indeed a very friendly wo|man, was very unwilling to give; and as he perceived that &s;he evaded his que&s;tion, he became more &s;olicitous to obtain an an&s;wer. After much he&s;itation, which perhaps had a wor&s;e effect than any tale which malice could have invented, &s;he told him, that, "Madam kept a great deal of company, and had often &s;taid out very late: that &s;he had always been u&s;ed to quietne&s;s and regularity: and was determined to let her apartments to &s;ome per&s;on in a more private &s;tation."</P>
<P>At this account <HI>Mercator</HI> changed countenance; for he Inferred from it ju&s;t as much more than truth as he be|lieved it to be le&s;s. After &s;ome moments of &s;u&s;pence, he conjured her to conceal nothing from him, with an emo|tion which convinced her &s;he had already &s;aid too much. She then a&s;&s;ured him, "That he had no rea&s;on to be alarmed; for that &s;he had no exception to his lady, but
<PB N="245" REF="029518_0122_0FE1CDBFC10D7860">
tho&s;e gaieties which her &s;tation and the fa&s;hion &s;ufficient|ly authorized." <HI>Mercator's</HI> &s;u&s;picions, however, were not wholly removed; and he began to think he had found a confidante, whom it would be his intere&s;t to tru&s;t: he therefore, in the folly of his jealou&s;y, confe&s;&s;|ed, "That he had &s;ome doubts concerning his wife, which it was of the utmo&s;t importance to his honour and his peace to re&s;olve: he intreated her that he might continue in the apartment another year: that as he &s;hould again leave the kingdom in a &s;hort time, &s;he would &s;uffer no incident, which might confirm either his hopes or fears, to e&s;cape her notice in his ab&s;ence; and that at his return, &s;he would give him &s;uch an account as would at lea&s;t deliver him from the torment of &s;u&s;|pence, and determine his future conduct."</P>
<P><HI>Mercator,</HI> however, concealed his &s;u&s;picions from his wife; and, indeed, in her pre&s;ence they were forgotten. Her manner of life he began &s;eriou&s;ly to di&s;approve; but being well acquainted with her temper, in which great &s;weetne&s;s was blended with a high &s;pirit, he would not embitter the plea&s;ure of a &s;hort &s;tay by altercation, chi|ding, and tears: but when her mind was melted into tenderne&s;s at his departure, he cla&s;ped her in an ec&s;ta&s;y of fondne&s;s to his bo&s;om, and intreated her to behave with re&s;erve and circum&s;pection: "becau&s;e, &s;aid he, I know that my father keeps a watchful eye upon your conduct, which may, therefore, confirm or remove his di&s;plea&s;ure, and either intercept or be&s;tow &s;uch an in|crea&s;e in our fortune, as will prevent the pangs of &s;epara|tion, which mu&s;t otherwi&s;e &s;o often return, and in a &s;hort time unite us to part no more." To this caution &s;he had then no power to reply; and they parted with mu|tual prote&s;tations of unalterable love.</P>

<HEAD>The Story of FLAVILLA concluded.</HEAD>
<P>FLAVILLA, &s;oon after &s;he was thus left in a kind of widowhood a &s;econd time, found her&s;elf with child; and within &s;omewhat le&s;s than eight months after <HI>Merca|tor's</HI> return from his fir&s;t voyage, &s;he happened to &s;tum|ble as &s;he was going up &s;tairs, and being immediately taken ill, &s;he was brought to bed before the next morn|ing. The child, though its birth had been precipitated
<PB N="246" REF="029518_0123_0FE1CDC15DDAAB70">
more than a month, was not remarkably &s;mall, nor had any infirmity which endangered its life.</P>
<P>It was now nece&s;&s;ary that the vigils of whi&s;ts, and the tumults of balls and vi&s;its &s;hould, for a while, be &s;u&s;pen|ded; and in this interval of languor and retirement, <HI>Fla|villa</HI> fir&s;t became thoughtful. She often reflected upon <HI>Mercator's</HI> caution when they la&s;t parted, which had made an indelible impre&s;&s;ion upon her mind, though it had produced no alteration in her conduct: notwith|&s;tanding the manner in which it was expre&s;&s;ed, and the rea&s;on upon which it was founded, &s;he began to fear that it might have been &s;ecretly prompted by jealou&s;y. The birth, therefore, of her fir&s;t child in his ab&s;ence, at a time when, if it had not been premature, it could not po&s;&s;ibly have been his, was an accident which greatly alarmed her: but there was yet another, for which it was &s;till le&s;s in her power to account, and which there|fore alarmed her &s;till more.</P>
<P>It happened that &s;ome civilities which &s;he received from a lady who &s;at next her at an opera, and whom &s;he had never &s;een before, introduced a conver&s;ation, which &s;o greatly delighted her, that &s;he gave her a pre&s;&s;ing invitation to vi&s;it her: this invitation was accepted, and in a few days the vi&s;it was paid. <HI>Flavilla</HI> was not le&s;s plea&s;ed at the &s;econd interview than &s;he had been at the fir&s;t; and without making any other inquiry concerning the lady, than where &s;he lived, took the fir&s;t opportunity to wait upon her. The apartment in which &s;he was re|ceived, was the ground-floor of an elegant hou&s;e, at a &s;mall di&s;tance from St. <HI>James's.</HI> It happened that <HI>Fla|villa</HI> was placed near the window; and a party of the hor&s;e&mdash;guards riding through the &s;treets, &s;he expected to &s;ee &s;ome of the royal family, and ha&s;tily threw up the fa&s;h. A gentleman who was pa&s;&s;ing by at the &s;ame in|&s;tant, turned about at the noi&s;e of the window, and <HI>Fla|villa</HI> no &s;ooner &s;aw his face, than &s;he knew him to be the father of <HI>Mercator.</HI> After looking fir&s;t &s;teadfa&s;tly at her, and then glancing his eye at the lady whom &s;he was vi&s;it|ing, he affected a contemptuous &s;neer, and went on. <HI>Flavilla,</HI> who had been thrown into &s;ome confu&s;ion, by the &s;udden and unexpected &s;ight of a per&s;on who &s;he knew con&s;idered her as the di&s;grace of his family, and the ruin of his child, now changed countenance, and
<PB N="247" REF="029518_0123_0FE1CDC15DDAAB70">
ha&s;tily retired to another part of the room: &s;he was touched both with grief and anger at this &s;ilent in&s;ult, of which, however, &s;he did not then &s;u&s;pect the cau&s;e. It is, indeed, probable, that the father of <HI>Mercator</HI> would no where have looked upon her with complacency; but as &s;oon as he &s;aw her companion, he recollected that &s;he was the favourite mi&s;tre&s;s of an old courtier, and that this was the hou&s;e in which he kept her in great &s;plen|dor, though &s;he had been by turns a pro&s;titute to many others. It happened that <HI>Flavilla,</HI> &s;oon after this acci|dent, di&s;covered the character of her new acquaintance; and never remembered by whom &s;he had been &s;een in her company, without the utmo&s;t regret and apprehen|&s;ion.</P>
<P>She now re&s;olved to move in a le&s;s circle, and with more circum&s;pection. In the mean time her little boy, whom &s;he &s;uckled, grew very fa&s;t; and it could no longer be known by his appearance that he had been born too &s;oon. His mother frequently gazed on him till her eyes overflowed with tears; and though her plea&s;ures were now become dome&s;tic, yet &s;he feared le&s;t that which had produced, &s;hould de&s;troy them. After much deliberation, &s;he determined that &s;he would conceal the child's age from its father, believing it prudent to prevent a &s;u&s;picion, which, however ill founded, it might be difficult to re|move, as her ju&s;tification would depend wholly upon the te&s;timony of her dependants; and her mother's and her own would nece&s;&s;arily become doubtful, when every one would have rea&s;on to conclude, that it would &s;till have been the &s;ame, &s;uppo&s;ing the contrary to have been true.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;tate of <HI>Flavilla'</HI>s mind, and her little boy was &s;ix months old when <HI>Mercator</HI> returned. She received him with joy indeed, but it was mixed with a vi&s;ible confu&s;ion; their meeting was more tender, but on her part it was le&s;s cheerful; &s;he &s;miled with inexpre&s;&s;ible complacency, but at the &s;ame time the tears gu&s;hed from her eyes, and &s;he was &s;eized with an univer&s;al tremor. <HI>Mercator</HI> caught the infection; and care&s;&s;ed fir&s;t his <HI>Flavil|la,</HI> and then his boy, with an exce&s;s of fondne&s;s and delight that before he had never experienced. The &s;ight of the child made him more than ever wi&s;h a reconciliation with his father; and having heard at his fir&s;t landing that he was dangerou&s;ly ill, he determined to go immediately
<PB N="248" REF="029518_0124_0FE1CDCC8EACC278">
and attempt to &s;ee him, promi&s;ing that he would return to &s;upper. He had in the mid&s;t of his care&s;&s;es more than once inquired the age of his &s;on, but the que&s;tion had been always evaded; of which, however, he took to notice, nor did it produce any &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>He was now ha&s;tening to inquire after his father; but as he pa&s;&s;ed through the hall, he was officiou&s;ly laid hold of by the landlady. He was not much di&s;po&s;ed to inquire how &s;he had fulfilled his charge; but perceiving by her looks that &s;he had &s;omething to communicate, which at lea&s;t in her own opinion was of importance, he &s;uffered her to take him into her parlour. She immediately &s;hut the door, and reminded him, that &s;he had undertaken an office with reluctance which he pre&s;&s;ed upon her; and that &s;he had done nothing in it to which he had not bound her by a promi&s;e; that &s;he was exceeding &s;orry to com|municate her di&s;coveries; but that he was a worthy gentleman indeed, and ought to know them. She then told him, <Q>That the child was born within le&s;s than eight months after his la&s;t return from abroad; that it was &s;aid to have come before its time, but that having pre&s;&s;ed to &s;ee it, &s;he was refu&s;ed.</Q> This indeed was true, and confirmed the good woman in her &s;u&s;picion; for <HI>Flavilla,</HI> who had &s;till re&s;ented the freedom which &s;he had taken in her remon&s;trance, had kept her at a great di&s;tance; and the &s;ervants, to gratify their mi&s;tre&s;s, treated her with the utmo&s;t in&s;olence and contempt.</P>
<P>At this relation <HI>Mercator</HI> turned pale. He now recol|lected that his que&s;tion concerning the child's birth had been evaded; and concluded, that he had been &s;hedding tears of tenderne&s;s and joy over a &s;trumpet and a ba&s;tard, who had robbed him of his patrimony, his honor, and his peace. He &s;tarted up with the furious wildne&s;s of &s;udden frenzy; but &s;he with great difficulty prevailed upon him not to leave the room. He &s;at down, and remained &s;ome time motionle&s;s, with his eyes fixed on the ground, and his hands locked in each other. In proportion as he believed his wife to be guilty, his ten|derne&s;s for his father revived; and he re&s;olved, with yet greater zeal, to pro&s;ecute his purpo&s;e of immediately attempting a reconciliation.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of confu&s;ion and di&s;tre&s;s, he went to the hou&s;e, where he learned that his father had died early in
<PB N="249" REF="029518_0124_0FE1CDCC8EACC278">
the morning, and that his relations were then a&s;&s;embled to read his will. <HI>Fulvius,</HI> a brother of <HI>Mercator's</HI> mother, with whom he had always been a favourite, happening to pa&s;s from one room to another, heard his voice. He acco&s;ted him with great ardour and friend&s;hip; and &s;oothing him with expre&s;&s;ions of condolence and affec|tion, in&s;i&s;ted to introduce him to the company. <HI>Mercator</HI> tacitly con&s;ented: he was received at la&s;t with civility by his brothers, and &s;itting down among them, the will was read. He &s;eemed to li&s;ten like the re&s;t; but was indeed mu&s;ing over the &s;tory which he had ju&s;t heard, and lo&s;t in the &s;peculations of his own wretchedne&s;s. He awaked as from a dream, when the voice of the per&s;on who had been reading was &s;u&s;pended; and finding that he could no longer contain him&s;elf, he &s;tarted up, and would have left the company.</P>
<P>Of the will which had been read before him, he knew nothing: but his uncle believing that he was moved with grief and re&s;entment at the manner in which he had been mentioned in it, and the beque&s;t only of a &s;hilling, took him into another room; and, to apologize for his father's unkindne&s;s, told him, "That the re&s;entment which he expre&s;&s;ed at his marriage, was every day increa&s;|ed by the conduct of his wife, who&s;e character was now become notoriou&s;ly infamous, for that &s;he had been &s;een at the lodgings of a known pro&s;titute, with whom &s;he appeared to be well acquainted." This account threw <HI>Mercator</HI> into another agony: from which he was, how|ever, at length recovered by his uncle, who, as the only expedient by which he could retrieve his misfortune, and &s;ooth his di&s;tre&s;s, propo&s;ed that he &s;hould no more return to his lodgings, but go home with him; that he would him&s;elf take &s;uch mea&s;ures with his wife as would &s;carce fail of inducing he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to 'accept a &s;eparate maintenance, a&s;&s;ume another name, and trouble him no more. <HI>Merca|tor,</HI> in the bitterne&s;s of his affliction, con&s;ented to his propo&s;al, and they went away together.</P>
<P><HI>Mercator,</HI> in the mean time, was expected by <HI>Flavilla</HI> with the mo&s;t tender impatience. She had put her little boy to bed, and decorated a &s;mall room in which they had been u&s;ed to &s;up by them&s;elves, and which &s;he had &s;hut up in his ab&s;ence; &s;he counted the moments as they pa&s;&s;ed, and li&s;tened to every carriage and every &s;tep that
<PB N="250" REF="029518_0125_0FE1CDCFC99C57A8">
&s;he heard. Supper was now ready. Her impatience was increa&s;ed; terror was at length mingled with regret, and her fondne&s;s was only bu&s;ied to afflict her: &s;he wi&s;hed, &s;he feared, &s;he accu&s;ed, &s;he apologized, and &s;he wept. In the height of the&s;e eager expectations, and this tender di&s;tre&s;s, &s;he received a billet which <HI>Mercator</HI> had been per&s;uaded by his uncle to write, in which he up|braided her in the &s;tronge&s;t terms with abu&s;ing his con|fidence, and di&s;honouring his bed: "Of this, he &s;aid, he had now obtained &s;ufficient proof to do ju&s;tice to him|&s;elf, and that he was determined to &s;ee her no more."</P>
<P>To tho&s;e who&s;e hearts have not already acquainted them with the agony which &s;eized <HI>Flavilla</HI> upon the &s;ight of the billet, all attempts to de&s;cribe it would not only be ineffectual, but ab&s;urd. Having pa&s;&s;ed the night without &s;leep, and the next day without food, di&s;ap|pointed in every attempt to di&s;cover what was become of <HI>Mercator,</HI> and doubting, if &s;he could have found h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, whether it would be po&s;&s;ible to convince him of her inno|cence: the violent agitation of her mind produced a &s;low fever, which, before &s;he con&s;idered as a di&s;ea&s;e, &s;he com|municated to the child while &s;he cheri&s;hed it at her bo&s;om, and wept over it as an orphan who&s;e life &s;he was &s;u&s;tain|ing with her own.</P>
<P>After <HI>Mercator</HI> had been ab&s;ent about ten days, his uncle, having per&s;uaded him to accompany &s;ome friends, to a country-&s;eat at the di&s;tance of near &s;ixty miles, went to his lodgings in order to di&s;charge the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and try what terms he could make with <HI>Flavilla,</HI> whom he hoped to intimidate with threats of a pro&s;ecution and divorce; but when he came, he found that <HI>Flavilla</HI> was &s;inking very fa&s;t under the di&s;ea&s;e, and that the child was dead already. The woman of the hou&s;e, into who&s;e hands &s;he had ju&s;t put her repeating-watch and &s;ome other orna|ments, as a &s;ecurity for her rent, was &s;o touched with her di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;o firmly per&s;uaded of her innocence by the manner in which &s;he had addre&s;&s;ed her, and the calm &s;olemnity with which &s;he ab&s;olved tho&s;e by whom &s;he had been traduced, that as &s;oon as &s;he had di&s;covered <HI>Fulvius's</HI> bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;he threw her&s;elf on her knees, and intreated, that if he knew where <HI>Mercator</HI> was to be found, he would urge him to return, that, if po&s;&s;ible, the life of <HI>Flavilla</HI> might be pre&s;erved, and the happine&s;s of both be re&s;to|red
<PB N="251" REF="029518_0125_0FE1CDCFC99C57A8">
by her ju&s;tification. <HI>Fulvius,</HI> who &s;till &s;u&s;pected appearances, or at lea&s;t was in doubt of the cau&s;e that had produced them, would not di&s;cover his nephew; but after much intreaty and expo&s;tulation, at la&s;t enga|ged upon his honour for the conveyance of a letter. The woman, as &s;oon as &s;he obtained his promi&s;e, ran up and communicated it to <HI>Flavilla,</HI> who, when &s;he had recovered from the &s;urpri&s;e and tumult which it occa|&s;ioned, was &s;upported in her bed, and in about half an hour, after many efforts, and many intervals, wrote a &s;hort billet, which was &s;ealed, and put into the hands of <HI>Fulvius.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fulvius</HI> immediately inclo&s;ed and di&s;patched it by the po&s;t, re&s;olving that in a que&s;tion &s;o doubtful and of &s;uch importance, he would no farther interpo&s;e. <HI>Mercator,</HI> who the moment he ca&s;t his eye upon the letter, knew both the hand and &s;eal, after pau&s;ing a few moments in &s;u&s;pence, at length tore it open, and read the&s;e words:</P>
<P>"Such has been my folly, that perhaps I &s;hould not be acquitted of guilt in any circum&s;tances but tho&s;e in which I write. I do not, therefore, but for your &s;ake, with them otherwi&s;e than they are. The dear infant, who&s;e birth has undone me, now lies dead at my &s;ide, a victim to my indi&s;cretion and your re&s;entment. I am &s;carce able to guide my pen. But I mo&s;t earne&s;tly in|treat to &s;ee you, that you at lea&s;t may have the &s;atisfac|tion to hear me atte&s;t my innocence with the la&s;t &s;igh, and &s;eal our reconciliation on my lips, while they are yet &s;en&s;ible of the impre&s;&s;ion".</P>
<P><HI>Mercator,</HI> whom an earthquake would le&s;s have affect|ed than this letter, felt all his tenderne&s;s revive in a mo|ment, and reflected with unutterable angui&s;h upon the ra&s;hne&s;s of his re&s;entment. At the thought of his di&s;|tance from <HI>London,</HI> he &s;tarted as if he had felt a dagger in his heart: he lifted up his eyes to heaven, with a look that expre&s;&s;ed at once an accu&s;ation of him&s;elf, and a petition for her; and then ru&s;hing out of the hou&s;e without taking leave of any, or ordering a &s;ervant to attend him, he took po&s;t-hor&s;es in a neighbouring inn, and in le&s;s than &s;ix hours was in <HI>Leice&s;ter Fields.</HI> But notwith&s;tanding his &s;peed, he arrived too late; <HI>Flavilla</HI> had &s;uffered the la&s;t agony, and her eyes could behold him no more. Grief and di&s;appointment, remor&s;e and
<PB N="252" REF="029518_0126_0FE1CDD168685C40">
de&s;pair, now totally &s;ubverted his rea&s;on. It become nece&s;&s;ary to remove him by force from the body, and after a confinement of two years in a mad-hou&s;e, he died.</P>
<P>May every lady on who&s;e memory compa&s;&s;ion &s;hall record the&s;e events, tremble to a&s;&s;ume the levity of <HI>Flavilla!</HI> for perhaps it is not in the power of any man in <HI>Mercator'</HI>s circum&s;tances to be le&s;s jealous than <HI>Mercator.</HI></P>

following true narrative may plead in my behalf to an injured woman, reconcile me to my&s;elf, and re&s;tore that tranquility of mind, which I have &s;o lately forfeited by my own folly and indi&s;cretion.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t know that I am the &s;on of an hone&s;t trade&s;|men, was by him brought up at a public &s;chool, and from thence went to the univer&s;ity. Soon after my arrival there, a gentleman came down with his family to enter his &s;on, who had been my &s;chool-fellow, at one of the colleges: they &s;ent for me, and de&s;ired I would &s;hew them the univer&s;ity; a reque&s;t which I readily complied with, as it gratified my vanity of being &s;een with his daughter, a young lady of great beauty and fortune; advantages which often &s;upply the want of every other real good, but &s;erved in her only to adorn the &s;uperior qualities of the mind, and &s;et off the charms of virtue.</P>
<P>I &s;trove to make their time as agreeable as po&s;&s;ible, by that a&s;&s;iduity which never fails to plea&s;e, and all tho&s;e little &s;ervices which are &s;ure to conciliate affection: I united on my fair vi&s;itor, as you may imagine, with more than ordinary diligence, gratified her curio&s;ity by the fight of every thing that I thought worthy of her atten|tion, and endeavoured by being u&s;eful, to make my&s;elf agreeable. I &s;ucceeded &s;o well, in &s;hort, with the whole family, that when they left the place, I received a pre&s;&s;ing invitation from the father to &s;pend a week with them in <HI>London.</HI> Accordingly I waited on them, and was received with great politene&s;s; the morning we chiefly &s;pent in diver&s;ions within doors, and in the evening went to the play. This gave me an opportunity of frequent inter|views with the young lady, in which I could not help paying that tribute of prai&s;e to her accompli&s;hments which I know &s;he de&s;erved, and which I imagined &s;he expected; I &s;poke the language of love, without feeling the power of it, and in&s;en&s;ibly rai&s;ed a pa&s;&s;ion in her brea&s;t, which was yet a &s;tranger to my own. Little did I indeed at that time imagine, that with an intention merely to amu&s;e, I was laying &s;nares to deceive; and that whil&s;t I thought my&s;elf only playing the innocent Art of a fine gentleman, I was undermining the peace of an amiable woman, and de&s;troying the future happi|ne&s;s of a whole family.</P>
<P>When I took my leave, my friends told me they would
<PB N="254" REF="029518_0127_0FE1CDE41DA30D28">
not con&s;ent to part with me &s;o &s;oon, unle&s;s I would pro|mi&s;e, on the fir&s;t lei&s;ure I had, to return; with which propo&s;al I readily acquie&s;ced. As I had no great de&s;ire to change a &s;cene of gaiety and plea&s;ure for the gloom of a college, the reflection of it threw a melancholy on my features, which the lady attributed to a different cau&s;e. I fetched a deep &s;igh at parting, and retired from her with a &s;ilent &s;orrow, which I afterwards found had left a &s;tronger impre&s;&s;ion on her heart than all the fine things I had &s;aid; and confirmed her in the opinion &s;he had conceived of my inviolable attachment to her. I returned to the univer&s;ity, where my attention was &s;oon called off to other views, and my thoughts fixed on ob|jects of a different nature: nor &s;hould I, perhaps, from that hour, have called to mind the now forgotten fair one, had not a letter, which I received from her about three months afterwards, greatly &s;urpri&s;ed and di&s;turbed me.</P>
<P>"She would not, &s;he there informed me, have broken through the pre&s;cribed forms of her &s;ex, but that, as &s;he well knew my de&s;igns were honourable, and nothing but my own diffidence had concealed them, &s;he looked on her&s;elf as bound in honour to let me know that it would be acceptable to her; and that it would appear like af|fectation in her to &s;uppo&s;e I had meant merely to flatter and amu&s;e her; and as &s;he had &s;pared me the confu&s;ion of fir&s;t mentioning this, &s;he hoped I would &s;oon come to a more clear explanation." In a po&s;t&s;cript, &s;he added, "That her father was a man who had, what we call, &s;een the world, was determined to marry her at all events, up to her rank; and cho&s;e rather to &s;ee her &s;plendidly mi&s;erable, than ob&s;curely happy: that unle&s;s I &s;aved her, &s;he was ruined; and that a &s;hort time mu&s;t determine her late."</P>
<P>I need not tell you how I was confounded to find my&s;elf involved in an intrigue, before I had &s;o much as once &s;eriou&s;ly thought upon it; I therefore an&s;wered her in the mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive manner I could; repre&s;ented to her, that it would be the highe&s;t ingratitude in me to marry the daughter of a man who had &s;hewn me &s;uch uncommon civilities, without his con&s;ent; be&s;ides, that the di&s;parity of our fortunes mu&s;t be an un&s;urmountable object to a thinking per&s;on; that &s;he might one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> or other reproach me with breach of tru&s;t her&s;elf, or in&s;ult
<PB N="255" REF="029518_0127_0FE1CDE41DA30D28">
me on account of that very inequality which &s;he now &s;eemed to di&s;regard; that, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, the de&s;ire of plea&s;ing mu&s;t &s;ink into the fear of offending, and thus put an end to all vi&s;ionary &s;chemes of la&s;ting happine&s;s; that I was &s;orry &s;he had &s;o mi&s;taken my behaviour as to attribute that to love which is but the effect of gallantry. I then talked to her of a prie&s;t and marriage in the lan|guage of <HI>Lothario;</HI> and concluded by advi&s;ing her, for both our &s;akes, to think no more of it.</P>
<P>This, you may imagine, was an an&s;wer, which, whil&s;t my hand wrote it, my heart very &s;everely reproached me for. I could not but tacitly blame my&s;elf for that par|ticular regard and attachment to her which I had for|merly expre&s;&s;ed, and was not determined, whether I &s;hould not make a little &s;erious love to her the very next opportunity; when, in the mid&s;t of the&s;e reflections, I received the following letter, which be&s;t can tell the &s;tory of her mi&s;fortune, and expo&s;e the weakne&s;s of my pa&s;t conduct.</P>
<P>"It is over; and I am a &s;lave! yet the only hour that I can call my own I give to you, the only one that a hu&s;|band's authority has no right to interrupt. To &s;um up all my mi&s;eries, in a word, know, my father has this morning given me up to &s;orrow and Mr.&mdash;. Alas! what delu&s;ive vi&s;ions of felicity did not your flattering tongue once give me leave to form! &s;uch as no turn of fortune can again recal. I tremble to think what a hu&s;|band's rage may inflict, when he finds, in&s;tead of the happine&s;s he expected, &s;o poor an entertainment as love compelled will afford him. It is impo&s;&s;ible for different ma&s;ters to &s;hare one poor heart. With me he may en|joy as much as the unwilling victim to brutal violence, and have as warm a return of fondne&s;s from the &s;heeted dead. But what am I &s;aying, and to whom? To him that has robbed me of my peace! can he now dry up tho&s;e tears which him&s;elf alone could bid to flow? Or can he heal tho&s;e wounds which him&s;elf has made? But the wor&s;t is pa&s;t; all the pa&s;&s;ions that have racked me &s;ince I received you la&s;t are hu&s;hed; and what little &s;pirit remains will &s;oon give way to the &s;ilent eating &s;orrow after this. Think that you have robbed me of what not all my fortune can purcha&s;e for me, nor the whole world be&s;ide hath power to be&s;tow. Ever &s;ince I was taught to
<PB N="256" REF="029518_0128_0FE1CDE5BAE5FCD8">
form a wi&s;h, it was that of being a happy mother, and a tender wife. I may now have a child whom its father's vices will exclude from that exce&s;s of fondne&s;s which I would otherwi&s;e have poured over it; and you know too well his character to hope any alteration in him: and yet this man my religion henceforth binds me to be true to, and obey. Farewell! and know, however I condemn your conduct, that would my brother, jealous of this hon|our as he is, this moment revenge me, I had rather for|give than re&s;ent it. Live then, and be happy; and may that happine&s;s never be &s;u&s;pended a moment by the re|membrance of her whom your fal&s;ehood has made for ever mi&s;erable."</P>
<P>If your heart has not already informed you what I felt on this, it will be needle&s;s to tell you how &s;everely I now accu&s;e my own weak conduct; nor can I &s;oon forgive my&s;elf the wanton &s;acrifice of youth, innocence, beauty and virtue, to fa&s;hionable levity, and polite perfidiou&s;ne&s;s. It is I that have given the wound inflicted by her father a deeper &s;mart, though it is him&s;elf who has made that mi&s;ery la&s;ting. I can only wi&s;h this may be a u&s;eful le&s;|&s;on, to warn all young gentlemen, my fellow profligates, never to expre&s;s a particular regard where they have not &s;erious thoughts of love; and to teach parents whom heaven has ble&s;t with dutiful children, rather to make them happy than great; or by their authority never to violate tho&s;e hearts which they have only a right to guide.</P>

<P>BOZALDAB, Caliph of <HI>Egypt,</HI> had dwelt &s;ecurely for many years in the &s;ilken pavilions of plea&s;ure, and had every morning anointed his head with the oil of gladne&s;s, when his only &s;on <HI>Aboram,</HI> for whom he had crowded his trea&s;ures with gold, extended his dominions with conque&s;ts, and &s;ecured them with impregnable for|tre&s;&s;es,
<PB N="257" REF="029518_0128_0FE1CDE5BAE5FCD8">
was &s;uddenly wounded, as he was hunting, with an arrow from an unknown hand, and expired in the field.</P>
<P><HI>Bozaldab,</HI> in the di&s;traction of grief and de&s;pair, refu|&s;ed to return to his palace, and retired to the gloomie&s;t grotto in the neighbouring mountains: he there rolled him&s;elf in the du&s;t, tore away the hairs of his hoary head, and da&s;hed the cup of con&s;olation, that <HI>Patience</HI> offered him, to the ground, He &s;uffered not his min&s;trels to ap|proach his pre&s;ence; but li&s;tened to the &s;creams of the melancholy birds of midnight, that flirt through the &s;ol|itary vaults and echoing chambers of the pyramids.</P>
<P>"Can that God be benevolent, he cried, who thus wounds the &s;oul, as from an ambu&s;h, with unexpected &s;orrows, and cru&s;hes his creatures in a moment with irre|mediable calamity? Ye lying <HI>Imans,</HI> prate to us no more of the ju&s;tne&s;s and kindne&s;s of an all-directing and all-loving Providence! he, whom ye pretend reigns in hea|ven, is &s;o far from protecting the mi&s;erable &s;ons of men, that he perpetually delights to bla&s;t the &s;weete&s;t flower|ets in the garden of hope; and, like a malignant giant, to beat down the &s;tronge&s;t towers of happine&s;s with the iron mace of anger. If this being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the goodne&s;s and the power with which flattering prie&s;ts have inve&s;ted him, he would doubtle&s;s be inclined and enabled to ban|i&s;h tho&s;e evils which render the world a dungeon of di&s;|tre&s;s, a vale of vanity and woe. I will continue in it no longer.</P>
<P>At this mome<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t he furiou&s;ly rai&s;ed his hand, which <HI>de&s;pair</HI> had armed with a dagger, to &s;trike deep into his bo&s;om; when &s;uddenly thick fla&s;hes of lightning &s;hot through the cavern, and a being of more than human beauty and magnitude, arrayed in azure robes, crowned with amaranth, and waving a branch of palm in his right hand, arre&s;ted the arm of the trembling and a&s;toni&s;hed Caliph, and &s;aid with a maje&s;tic &s;mile, "Follow me to the top of this mountain."</P>
<P>"Look from hence, &s;aid the awful conductor: I am <HI>Color,</HI> the angel of <HI>Peace;</HI> look from hence into the valley."</P>
<P><HI>Bozaldab</HI> opened his eyes, and beheld a barren, &s;ultry, and &s;olitary i&s;land, in the mid&s;t of which &s;at a pale, mea|gre, and gha&s;tly figure: it was a merchant ju&s;t &s;tarving with famine, and lamenting that he could find neither

wild berries nor a &s;ingle &s;pring in this forlorn uninhab|ited de&s;art; and begging the protection of Heaven again&s;t the tygers that would now certainly de&s;troy him, &s;ince he had con&s;umed the la&s;t fuel he had collected to make nightly fires to affright them. He then ca&s;t a ca&s;ket of jewels on the &s;and as trifles of no u&s;e; and crept feeble and trembling to an eminence, where he was ac|cu&s;tomed to &s;it every evening to watch the &s;etting &s;un, and to give a &s;ignal to any &s;hip that might happily ap|proach the i&s;land.</P>
<P>"Inhabitant of heaven, cried <HI>Bozaldab,</HI> &s;uffer not this wretch to peri&s;h by the fury of wild bea&s;ts." "Peace, &s;aid the angel, and ob&s;erve."</P>
<P>He looked again, and beheld a ve&s;&s;el arrived at the de&s;olate i&s;le. What words can paint the rapture of the &s;tarving merchant, when the captain offered to tran&s;port him to his native country, if he would reward him with half the jewels of his ca&s;ket. No &s;ooner had this pitiful commander received the &s;tipulated &s;um, than he held a con&s;ultation with the crew, and they agreed to &s;eize the remaining jewels, and leave the unhappy exile in the &s;ame helple&s;s and lamentable condition in which they di&s;cov|ered him. He wept and trembled, intreated and implo|red in vain.</P>
<P>"Will Heaven permit &s;uch inju&s;tice to be practi&s;ed?" exclaimed <HI>Bozaldab.</HI> "Look again, &s;aid the angel, and behold the very &s;hip in which, &s;hort-&s;ighted as thou art, thou wi&s;hed&s;t the merchant might embark, da&s;hed in pieces on a rock: do&s;t thou not hear the cries of the &s;inking &s;ailors? Pre&s;ume not to direct the <HI>Governor of the Univer&s;e</HI> in the di&s;po&s;al of events. The man whom thou ha&s;t pitied &s;hall be taken from this dreary &s;olitude, but not by the method thou would&s;t pre&s;cribe. His vice was avarice, by which he became not only abominable, but wretched: he fancied &s;ome mighty charm in wealth, which, like the wand of <HI>Abdiel,</HI> would gratify every wi&s;h, and obviate every fear. This wealth he has now been taught not only to de&s;pi&s;e but to abhor: he ca&s;t his jewels upon the &s;and, and conf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ed them to be u&s;ele&s;s; he offered part of them to the mariners, and perceived them to be pernicious; he has now learned, that they are rendered u&s;eful or vain, good or evil, only by the &s;it|uation and temper of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or.

di&s;tre&s;s has taught wi&s;dom! but turn thine ayes to ano|ther and more intere&s;ting &s;cene."&mdash;The Caliph in&s;tantly beheld a magnificent palace, adorned with &s;tatues of his ance&s;tors wrought in ja&s;per; the ivory doors of which turning on hinges of the gold of <HI>Golconda,</HI> di&s;covered a throne of diamonds, &s;urrounded by the rajas of fifty na|tions, and with amba&s;&s;adors in various habits, and of different complexions; on which &s;at <HI>Aboram,</HI> the much-lamented &s;on of <HI>Bozaldab,</HI> and by his &s;ide a prince&s;s fairer than a Houri.</P>
<P>"Gracious <HI>Alla!</HI>&mdash;It is my &s;on! cried the Caliph, O let me hold him to my heart!" "Thou can&s;t not gra&s;p an un&s;ub&s;tantial vi&s;ion, replied the angel: I am now &s;hewing thee what would have been the de&s;tiny of thy &s;on, had he continued longer on the earth." "And why, returned <HI>Bozaldab,</HI> why was he not permitted to continue? Why was he not &s;uffered to be a witne&s;s of &s;o much felicity and power?" "Con&s;ider the &s;equel," re|plied he that dwells in the fifth heaven. <HI>Bozaldab</HI> looked earne&s;tly, and &s;aw the countenance of his &s;on, on which he had been u&s;ed to behold the placid &s;mile of &s;implicity, and the vivid blu&s;hes of health, now di&s;torted with rage, and now fixed in the in&s;en&s;ibility of drunkenne&s;s: it was again animated with di&s;dain, it became pale with apprehen&s;ion, and appeared to be with|ered with intemperance; his hands were &s;tained with blood, and he trembled by turns with fury and terror. The palace &s;o lately &s;hining with Oriental pomp, changed &s;uddenly into the cell of a dungeon, where his &s;on lay &s;tretched out on a cold pavement, gagged and bound, and his eyes put out. Soon after he perceived the favor|ite &s;ultana, who before was &s;eated by his &s;ide, enter with a bowl of poi&s;on, which &s;he compelled <HI>Aboram</HI> to drink, and aftewards married the &s;ucce&s;&s;or to his throne.</P>
<P>"Happy, &s;aid <HI>Coloc,</HI> is he whom Providence has, by the angel of death, &s;natched from guilt! from whom that power is withheld, which, if he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, would have accumulated upon him&s;elf yet greater mi&s;ery than it could have done upon others."</P>
<P>"It is enough, cried <HI>Bozaldab;</HI> I adore the in&s;erntable &s;chemes of omni&s;cience!&mdash;From what dreadful evils has my &s;on been re&s;cued, by a death which I ra&s;hly be|wailed as unfortunate and premature! a death of inno|cence

and peace, which has ble&s;&s;ed his memory on earth, and tran&s;mitted his &s;pirit to the &s;kies."</P>
<P>"Ca&s;t away the dagger, replied the heavenly me&s;&s;en|ger, which thou wa&s;t preparing to plunge into thine own heart. Exchange complaint for &s;ilence, and doubt for adoration. Can a mortal look down without giddi|ne&s;s and &s;tupefaction into the va&s;t aby&s;s of eternal wi&s;|dom? Can a mind that &s;ees not infinitely, perfectly comprehend any thing among an infinity of objects mu|tually relative? Can the channels, which thou com|mande&s;t to be cut to receive the annual inundation of the <HI>Nile,</HI> contain the waters of the ocean? Remember, that perfect happine&s;s cannot be conferred on a creature; for perfect happine&s;s is an attribute as incommunicable as perfect power and eternity."</P>
<P>The angel, while he was &s;peaking thus, &s;tretched out his pinions to fly back to the empyreum, and the &s;lutter of his wings was like the ru&s;hing of a cataract.</P>
