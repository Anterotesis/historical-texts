<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P><HI>AT a time when the thir&s;t for knowledge is &s;o univer&s;al, that it is &s;ought after by all ranks of people; through its mo&s;t intricate windings, and mazy labyrinths, it is not to be wondered at, that books of &s;cience and polite literature are publi&s;hed in &s;uch abund|ance, and that they meet with that reception and en|couragement, from a liberal minded public, which their noble de&s;ign requires, and which their intrin&s;ic merit demands.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The de&s;ign of this publication, is not merely to amu&s;e; but rather, in an engaging, diver&s;ified and plea&s;ing manner, to attract the attention&mdash;imperceptibly gain the affections&mdash;and draw the &s;oul to a love of virtue, (by delineating her in her mo&s;t attractive and alluring dre&s;s) from whence ari&s;es the &s;pring of all great, noble and generous actions:&mdash;To inculcate a &s;incere dete&s;ta|tion of every &s;pecies of vice, by an expo&s;ition of the malevolent affections of the mind, as well in their &s;ofter, as in their more glaring, or aggravated colours.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="028841_0004_0FDD1DDC98AC8F10">
<HI>The above, though not the lea&s;t, is not the chief inten|tion of this &s;election.&mdash;The art of thinking ju&s;tly, &s;peak|ing pertinently and writing with correctne&s;s, ea&s;e, ele|gance and preci&s;ion upon any &s;ubject, has ever been e&s;teemed the fir&s;t ornament of the human mind, and ju&s;tly accounted the grand characteri&s;tical mark, by which the rational being is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the irra|tional.&mdash;Yet, how few do we find thus accompli&s;hed, or how very few give them&s;elves any trouble to hold their rank in the great &s;cale of animal creation? To render the above invaluable accompli&s;hment ea&s;y of acquirement, is the principal de&s;ign of</HI> THE HIVE, <HI>wherein all the vices, virtues, relative duties and affections of the hu|man &s;oul are delineated by the ma&s;terly hands of many of the fir&s;t writers in the Engli&s;h language, who are as much e&s;teemed for their correctne&s;s, ea&s;e, elegance and beauty of diction, as for their conci&s;ene&s;s, per&s;picuity, ju&s;tne&s;s and dignity of thought.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The editor of this mi&s;cellaneous volume, deeply im|pre&s;&s;ed with the importance of the above con&s;ideration, without any parade of unmeaning ceremony, humbly recommends</HI> THE HIVE <HI>to the &s;upport and attention of the candid public, as a publication &s;olely intended to improve the heart, to inform the judgment, and gently to draw the affections to the love of virtue.</HI></P>

<HEAD>AFFLICTIONS.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>THE PRESENT MISFORTUNE IS ALWAYS DEEMED THE GREATEST: THEREFORE, SMALL CAUSES ARE SUFFICIENT TO MAKE US UNEASY, WHEN GREAT ONES ARE NOT IN THE WAY.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WE ought to make a good improve|ment of pa&s;t and pre&s;ent afflictions. If they are not &s;anctified to us, they become a double cro&s;s; but if they work rightly in us, and, convince us of our failings, and how ju&s;tly we are afflicted, they do us much good. Affliction is a &s;piritual
<PB N="6" REF="028841_0006_0FDD1DDFB0726B88">
phy&s;ic for the &s;oul, and is compared to a furnace; for as gold is tried and purified therein, &s;o men are proved, and either purified from their dro&s;s, and fitted for good u&s;es, or el&s;e entirely burnt up and undone forever. Therefore may all who la|bour under any kind of affliction, have rea&s;on to &s;ay with JOB&mdash;"when he hath tried me, I &s;hall come forth as pure gold."</P>
<P>LET a man live (&s;ays Mr. Steele) but two or three years without affliction, and he is almo&s;t good for nothing, he cannot pray, nor meditate, nor keep his heart fixed upon &s;piritual things; but let God &s;mite him in his child, health, or e&s;tate; now he can find his tongue and affections again, now he awakes and falls to his duty in earne&s;t; now God has twice as much honour for him as he had before. Now, faith God, this amendment plea&s;eth me, this rod was well be&s;towed, I have di&s;appointed him in his great benefit and advan|tage.</P>
<P>IT may be boldly affirmed, that good men gen|erally reap more &s;ub&s;tantial benefit from their af|flictions, than bad men do from their pro&s;perities; and what they lo&s;e in wealth, plea&s;ure, or honor, they gain with va&s;t advantage in wi&s;dom, good|ne&s;s and tranquillity of mind.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="028841_0007_0FDD1DE1133F46D0">
PROSPERITY is not without its troubles, nor adver&s;ity without its comforts. A mind that can bear affliction without murmur, and the weight of a plentiful fortune without vain glory&mdash;that can be familiar without meanne&s;s, and re&s;erved with|out pride, has &s;omething in it great, particularly plea&s;ing, and truly admirable.</P>
<P>NOTHING would be more unhappy, (&s;aid De|metrius) than a man who had never known afflic|tion. The be&s;t need afflictions for the trial of their virtue: How can we exerci&s;e the grace of contentment, if all things &s;ucceed well? or, that of forgivene&s;s if we have no enemies?</P>
<P>HE who barely weeps at misfortunes, when it is in his power to heal them, is not touched with them to the heart, and only &s;heds the tears of a crocodile.</P>
<P>IF you are di&s;quieted at any thing, you &s;hould con&s;ider with your&s;elf, Is this thing of that worth, that for it I &s;hould &s;o di&s;turb my&s;elf, and lo&s;e my peace and tranquillity?</P>
<P>THE con&s;ideration of a greater evil, is a &s;ort of remedy again&s;t a le&s;&s;er. THEY are always im|paired by affliction, who are not improved by it. A virtuous man is more peaceable in adver&s;ity, than a wicked man in pro&s;perity.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="028841_0008_0FDD1E15A5E9DB38">
THE keeping of our&s;elves above grief, and every painful pa&s;&s;ion, is indeed very beautiful and ex|cellent; and none but &s;ouls of the fir&s;t rate &s;eem to be qualified for the undertaking.</P>
<P>IT were no virtue to bear calamities, if we did not feel them.</P>
<P>DIVINE PROVIDENCE always places the reme|dy near the evil; there is not any duty to which Providence has not annexed a ble&s;&s;ing; nor any affliction for which virtue has not provided a remedy.</P>
<P>IF &s;ome are refined like gold in the furnace of affliction, there are many more, that, like chaff, are con&s;umed in it.</P>
<P>SORROW, when it is exce&s;&s;ive, takes away fer|vour from piety, vigour from action, health from the body, light from the rea&s;on, and repo&s;e from the con&s;cience. Re&s;ignation to the divine will is a noble and needful le&s;&s;on.</P>
<P>YET there is a gloomy plea&s;ure in being deject|ed and incon&s;olable. Melancholy &s;tudies how to improve it&s;elf, and &s;orrow finds wonderful relief in being more &s;orrowful.</P>
<P>To be afflicted with the afflicted, is an in&s;tance of humanity, and the demand of good nature and
<PB N="9" REF="028841_0009_0FDD1E1716A21910">
good breeding: Pity is but an imaginary aid; and yet, were it not for that, &s;orrow would be many times utterly in&s;upportable.</P>
<P>MIRTH is by no means a remedy for grief; on the contrary, it rai&s;es and inflames it. The only probable way I know of, to &s;often or cure grief in others, is by putting on an appearance of feel|ing it your&s;elf; and you mu&s;t be&s;ides, talk fre|quently and feelingly on the occa&s;ion, and prai&s;e and blame as the &s;ufferer does; but then remember to make u&s;e of the opportunity this conde&s;cen&s;ion and familiarity gives you, of leading him, by de|grees, into things and pa&s;&s;ages remote from his pre&s;ent bent of mind, and not unplea&s;ing in them|&s;elves. In this manner, and by this policy, you will be able to &s;teal him away from his afflictions with his own approbation, and teach him to think and &s;peak of other things than that alone, which frets&mdash;or rather WRINGS his heart.</P>
<P>NONE &s;hould de&s;pair, becau&s;e God can help them, and none &s;hould pre&s;ume becau&s;e, God can cro&s;s them. A firm tru&s;t in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an Almighty Being naturally produces patience, hope, chearfulne&s;s and all other di&s;po&s;itions of mind, that alleviate tho&s;e calamities which we are not able to remove.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="028841_0010_0FDD1E3216BF93F0">
HE who is puffed up with the fir&s;t gale of pro&s;|perity, will bend beneath the fir&s;t bla&s;t of adver&s;ity.</P>
<P>REPROOF in adver&s;ity hath a double &s;ting.</P>
<P>THERE is but one way of fortifying the &s;oul again&s;t all gloomy pre&s;ages and terrors of the mind; and that is, by &s;ecuring to our&s;elves the friend&s;hip and protection of that being who di&s;|po&s;es of events, and governs futurity.</P>
<P>EVENTS which have the appearance of misfor|tunes, often prove a happy &s;ource of future felici|ty; this con&s;ideration &s;hould enable us to &s;upport affliction with calmne&s;s and fortitude.</P>

<HEAD>ANGER.</HEAD>
<P>AN angry man who &s;uppre&s;&s;es his pa&s;&s;ions, thinks wor&s;e than he &s;peaks, and an angry man that will chide, &s;peaks wor&s;e than he thinks. A vindictive temper is not only unea&s;y to others, but to them that have it.</P>
<P>ANGER may glance into the bo&s;om of a wife man, but re&s;ts only in the bo&s;om of fools.</P>

IN all things mi&s;takes are excu&s;able; but an error that proceeds from any good principle leaves no room for re&s;entment.</P>
<P>IT was a good method ob&s;erved by Socrates, when he found in him&s;elf any di&s;po&s;ition to an|ger, he would check it by &s;peaking low, in oppo|&s;ition to the motions of his di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>IT is much better to reprove ingenuou&s;ly, than to be angry &s;ecretly.</P>
<P>HE that waits for an opportunity of acting his revenge, watches to do him&s;elf a mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>BY taking revenge, a man is but even with his enemy, but by pa&s;&s;ing it over, he is &s;uperior.&mdash;</P>
<P>IT is the only valour to remit a wrong; and the greate&s;t applau&s;e that I might hurt and would not.</P>
<P>To be able to bear provocation, is an argument of great wi&s;dom; and to forgive it, of a great mind.</P>
<P>THEY who will be angry for any thing, will be angry for nothing.</P>
<P>NONE &s;hould be &s;o implacable as to refu&s;e an humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. He who&s;e very be&s;t actions mu&s;t be &s;een with favourable allowance, cannot be too mild, moderate and forgiving.</P>

<P>THE noble&s;t remedy for injuries is oblivion. Light injuries are made none by not regarding them.</P>
<P>THERE is no man obliged to live &s;o free from pa&s;&s;ion, as not in &s;ome ca&s;es to &s;how &s;ome re&s;ent|ment: There are injuries, affronts, &amp;c. that are frequently met with in our tour through life, where it would be rather a &s;toical &s;tupidity than virtue, to do otherwi&s;e: I do not mean revenge, for that mu&s;t ever be wrong, but a proper re&s;ent|ment, &s;o that the injurer may not be encouraged to commit a &s;econd injury.</P>
<P>ONE unquiet di&s;po&s;ition di&s;tempers the peace and unity of a whole family, or &s;ociety; as one jarring in&s;trument will &s;poil a whole concert.</P>
<P>OUR pa&s;&s;ions are like the &s;eas, agitated by the winds; but as God hath &s;et bounds to the&s;e, &s;o &s;hould we to tho&s;e? &s;o far &s;hould they go, and no farther.</P>
<P>REASON is given us, by him who breathed in us our immortal part, that in all our actions we &s;hould govern our&s;elves by advice of it.</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t forget the good we do, for fear of up|braiding, and religion bids us forget injuries, left

<P>HE that is always angry with his &s;in, &s;hall &s;el|dom &s;in in his anger.</P>
<P>HE that is not above an injury, is below him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>ANGER let loo&s;e is one of the mo&s;t fooli&s;h pa&s;|&s;ions, 'tis no wonder that is generally di&s;appoints it&s;elf, and mi&s;&s;es its end, by chu&s;ing the mo&s;t vio|lent means, which are &s;eldom &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>REASON in anger, is like a &s;hip in the tempe&s;t, hurried away by the waves, and often over&s;et.</P>
<P>THE angry man is his own &s;evere&s;t tormentor; his brea&s;t knows no peace, while his raging pa&s;|&s;ions are re&s;trained by no &s;en&s;e of either moral or religious duties: What would be his ca&s;e, if his unforgiving examples were followed by his all|merciful maker, who&s;e forgivene&s;s he can only hope for, in proportion as he him&s;elf forgives and loves his fellow creatures, through the merits and blood of the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us.</P>
<P>AN injury unan&s;wered, in cour&s;e, grows weary of it&s;elf, and dies away in a voluntary remor&s;e.&mdash;</P>

<HEAD>BEAUTY.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is nothing that gives us &s;o plea&s;ing a pro&s;pect of human nature, as the con|templation of wi&s;dom and beauty. Beauty is an overweaning, &s;elf-&s;ufficient thing, carele&s;s of pro|viding it&s;elf any more &s;ub&s;tantial ornament; nay, &s;o little does it con&s;ult its own intere&s;t, that it too often defeats it&s;elf by betraying that innocence which renders it lovely and de&s;irable. As there|fore virtue makes a beautiful woman appear more beautiful, &s;o beauty makes a virtuous woman really more virtuous.</P>
<P>IT is, methinks, a low and degrading idea of that &s;ex, which was created to refine the joys, and &s;often the cares of human nature, by the mo&s;t agreeable participation, to con&s;ider them merely as objects of &s;ight. This is abridging them of their natural extent of power, to put them upon a level
<PB N="17" REF="028841_0017_0FDD1EAB9A801690">
with their pictures. How much nobler is the con|templation of beauty heightened by virtue, and commanding our e&s;teem and love, while it draws our ob&s;ervation? How faint and &s;piritle&s;s are the charms of the coquet, when compared with the real loveline&s;s of innocence, piety, good humour, the irre&s;i&s;table charms of mode&s;ty unaffected, hu|manity, with all tho&s;e rare and plea&s;ing marks of &s;en&s;ibility; virtues, which add a new &s;oftne&s;s to her &s;ex; and even beautify her beauty.</P>
<P>NOTHING (&s;ays Mr. Addi&s;on) can atone for the want of mode&s;ty and innocence, without which, beauty is ungraceful and quality contemptible.</P>
<P>LET a women be decked with all the embelli&s;h|ments of art and care of nature; yet if boldne&s;s be to be read in her face, it blots all the lines of beauty.</P>
<P>THE plainer the dre&s;s, with greater lu&s;tre does beauty appear: Virtue is the greate&s;t ornament, and good &s;en&s;e the be&s;t equipage.</P>
<P>AN inviolable fidelity, good humour and com|placency of temper in a woman, outlive all the charms of a fine face, and make the decays of it invi&s;ible.</P>
<P>IT is but too &s;eldom &s;een, that beautiful per&s;ons are otherwi&s;e of great virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="028841_0018_0FDD1EAD1E575968">
No beauty hath any charms equal to the inward beauty of the mind. A gracefulne&s;s in the man|ners is much more engaging than that of the per|&s;on; the former every one has the power to attain to in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the latter is in no one's power,&mdash;is no internal worth, and was the gift of God, who formed us all.

<P>BEAUTY in&s;pires a plea&s;ing &s;entiment, which prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;es people in its favour. Mode&s;ty has great advantages, it &s;ets off beauty, and &s;erves as a veil to ugline&s;s. The misfortune of ugline&s;s is, that it &s;ometimes &s;mothers and buries much merit; people do not look for the engaging qualities of the head and heart in a forbidding figure. 'Tis no ea&s;y matter when merit mu&s;t make its way, and &s;hine through a di&s;agreeable out&s;ide.</P>
<P>WITHOUT virtue, good &s;en&s;e and &s;weetne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, the fine&s;t &s;et of features will, ere long cea&s;e to plea&s;e; but, where the&s;e with the graces are united, it mu&s;t afford an agreeable and plea&s;ing contemplation.</P>

<L>The charms of beauty, are the charms of &s;en&s;e.</L>

<P>BEAUTY without the graces of the mind, will have no power over the hearts of the wi&s;e and good. Beauty is a flower which &s;oon withers, health changes, and &s;trength abates, but innocency is immortal, and a comfort both in life and death.</P>

<P>WHEREVER you go, con&s;cience accompanies you, whatever you &s;ay, do, or but think, it regi&s;|ters and records in order to the day of account; when all friends for&s;ake you, when even your &s;oul for&s;akes your body, con&s;cience will not, cannot for&s;ake you; when your body is weake&s;t and dul|le&s;t, your con&s;cience is then mo&s;t vigorous and active. Never more life in the con&s;cience than when death makes its neare&s;t approach to the body. When it &s;miles, cheers, acquits and com|forts, O what a heaven doth it create within; and when it frowns, condemns and terrifies, how are our plea&s;ures, joys and delights of this world clouded, and even benighted!

<P>WHAT &s;culpture is to a block of marble, edu|cation is to the human &s;oul. The philo&s;opher, the &s;aint, the hero, the wi&s;e, the good, or the great man very often lie hid and concealed in a ple|beian; which a proper education might have di&s;|interred and brought to light.</P>

<P>GREAT men are always re&s;erved and mode&s;t, and being content with meriting prai&s;e, do not endeavour to court it; and for this they are the more prai&s;e worthy, becau&s;e if vanity <HI>is</HI> pardonable, it is in the man who de&s;erves tho&s;e &s;hining com|pliments, which are &s;o becoming to many learned men. 'Tis &s;aid, that Racine was a whole year in compo&s;ing his tragedy of Phaedra, the ma&s;ter piece of the theatre, and before he committed it to the &s;tage, con&s;ulted his friends a long time, corrected &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages by their advice, and waited for the &s;ucce&s;s of his performance before he would pre&s;ume to pronounce it a good one. Prado wrote the &s;ame in a month's time; gave it out boldly to be acted, and a&s;&s;ured the public it was an excel|lent piece. But it happened to him as it often does to all half witted authors; his work quickly went to the chandler's &s;hops, whereas Racine's will reach to the late&s;t po&s;terity.</P>
<P>GREAT talents, &s;uch as honour, virtue, learning and parts, are above the generality of the world who neither po&s;&s;e&s;s them them&s;elves, nor judge of them rightly in others: But all people are judges of the le&s;&s;er talents, &s;uch as civility, affability and an obliging agreeable addre&s;s and manner: Be|cau&s;e

they feel the good effects of them, as mak|ing &s;ociety ea&s;y and plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>ALMOST all the advantages or mi&s;carriages of our lives depend, in a great mea&s;ure, upon our education. Therefore it is greatly the duty of all who have in <HI>any</HI> way the in&s;pection of this impor|tant affair, by every means po&s;&s;ible, to win young minds to improvement; to the end that good parts may not take an evil turn, nor indifferent ones be totally lo&s;t for want of indu&s;trious cultivation.</P>
<P>EDUCATION, when it works upon an ingenious mind, brings out to view every latent perfection, which, without &s;uch helps are never able to make their appearance. And, if we take the trouble to look round, we &s;hall find very few, to whom na|ture has been &s;uch a niggard of her gifts, that they are not capable of &s;hining in one &s;phere of &s;cience or another: Since then there is a certain bias to|wards knowledge, in almo&s;t every mind, which may be &s;trengthened and improved by proper care; &s;ure parents and others &s;hould con&s;ider, that, in the neglect of &s;o e&s;&s;ential a point, they do not com|mit a private injury only, as thereby they &s;tarve po&s;|terity, and defraud our country of tho&s;e per&s;ons, who, under better management, might perhaps make an eminent figure.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="028841_0078_0FDDDAA9300ACC30">
INDEED, the difference in the manners and abil|ities of men proceeds more from education, than from any imperfections or advantages derived from their original formation.</P>
<P>YOUTH moreover is the proper and only &s;ea&s;on for education; for if it be neglected then, it will &s;urely be in vain to think of remedying the over|&s;ight in more advanced years; it will be too late to think of &s;owing it, when maturity has rendered the mind &s;tubborn and inflexible, and when, in|&s;tead of receiving the &s;eeds, it &s;hould be bringing forth the fruits of in&s;truction.</P>
<P>BUT there is one point in the article of educa|tion, which is more e&s;&s;ential than any of the re&s;t: I mean the great care that ought to be taken to form youth to the principles of religion. Vice, if we may believe the general complaint, grows &s;o ma|lignant now a days, that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to keep young people from the &s;preading contagion; if we venture them abroad, and tru&s;t to chance or inclination, for the choice of their company; it is therefore virtue, and a perfect &s;en&s;e of their duty to God, which is the great and valuable thing to be taught them. All other con&s;iderations and accom|pli&s;hments &s;hould give way, and be po&s;tponed, to the&s;e; the&s;e are the &s;olid and &s;ub&s;tantial good we &s;hould labour to implant and fa&s;ten on their minds, neither &s;hould we cea&s;e till we have attained a

<P>IT is al&s;o of the fir&s;t con&s;equence in training up youths of both &s;exes, that they be early in&s;pir|ed with humanity, and particularly that its princi|ples be implanted &s;trongly in their yet tender hearts, to guard them again&s;t inflicting wanton pain on tho&s;e animals, which u&s;e or accident may occa&s;ionally put into their power.</P>

<P>TAKE heed you harbour not that vice called Envy, le&s;t another's happine&s;s be your torment; and God's ble&s;&s;ing become your cur&s;e.&mdash;Spencer in his Fairy Queen gives the following de&s;cription of Envy:

<L>And wept, that cau&s;e of weeping none he had;</L>

<L>And him no le&s;s than any like did u&s;e;</L>
<L>And who with gracious bread the hungry feeds,</L>

<P>VIRTUE is not &s;ecure again&s;t envy. Men will <HI>le&s;&s;en</HI> what they will not imitate. It is ob&s;erved that the mo&s;t cen&s;orious are generally the lea&s;t ju|dicious; who having nothing to recommend them&s;elves, will be finding fault with others.</P>

<P>FRIENDSHIP is a &s;weet attraction of the heart, towards the merit we e&s;teem, or the perfections we admire; and produces a mutual inclination
<PB N="84" REF="028841_0084_0FDDDAB6D998C7B8">
between two per&s;ons, to promote each others in|tere&s;t, knowledge, virtue and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>THERE'S nothing &s;o common as pretences to friend&s;hip; though few know what it means, and fewer yet come up to its demands. By talking of it, we &s;et our&s;elves off; but when we enquire in|to it, we &s;ee our defects; and when we engage in it, we mu&s;t charge through abundance of difficul|ty. The veneration it has challenged in every age, (the mo&s;t barbarous not excepted) is a &s;tand|ing te&s;timony of its excellence: And the more valuable it is, the more are we concerned to be in&s;tructed in it.</P>
<P>MONSIEUR DE SAOY in his e&s;&s;ay upon friend|&s;hip, treats to this effect: The friend&s;hip which is to be recommended, is union of affections, &s;pringing from a generous re&s;pect to virtue, and is maintained by a harmony of manners. It is a great mi&s;take to call every trifling commerce by this &s;erious name; or to &s;uppo&s;e that empty com|pliments and vi&s;its of ceremony, when no more is intended than to pa&s;s the time, and &s;hew the equipage, &s;hould pa&s;s for a real and well e&s;tabli&s;h|ed friend&s;hip. The frequency of the practice will not wipe off the ab&s;urdity:&mdash;There is as wide a difference between a bully and a man of honour.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="028841_0085_0FDDDABA32EABAA0">
NOT that the&s;e amu&s;ements are to be found fault with, the innocence and convenience of which protects them, when they pa&s;s for nothing but what they are; but certainly they ought to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from their betters; and the language and profe&s;&s;ions bear a proportion to the real im|pre&s;&s;ion they have on our heart.</P>
<P>CONFORMITY of inclination is the life of friend|&s;hip.</P>
<P>WHILST all are pur&s;uing this common intere&s;t, all are travelling the &s;ame cour&s;e, nothing can break the union of their affections and de&s;ires. The danger is only from irregular motions, and forgetting from which they &s;hould act. So long as we maintain a re&s;pect to this principle of union, and keep virtue on the throne, our humour and caprice will be checked and &s;ubdued. If intere&s;t can maintain and form &s;ocieties, as we find it does, why &s;hould not tho&s;e who are actuated by a higher principle, (and with &s;uch only is our bu&s;i|ne&s;s) do as much, if not more.</P>
<P>IT may be &s;aid, from hence I conclude that all good men are friends, if virtue be the life of friend|&s;hip. The con&s;equence holds good as far as e&s;teem goes, if they knew one another, they would value one another. But though friend&s;hip is founded on e&s;teem, &s;o much that it cannot otherways &s;ub&s;i&s;t,
<PB N="86" REF="028841_0086_0FDDDABB29F96450">
there goes however, &s;omething more to form it, e&s;teem is a tribute due to merit in general; but friend&s;hip is an improvement made upon merit, and engages us in a very different degree.</P>
<P>SUCH impre&s;&s;ion has been made upon the heart as cannot be well de&s;cribed, and works like a mother's affection to her own children, above tho&s;e of &s;trangers, as amiable in them&s;elves. Tho&s;e who would have friend&s;hip confined to the nar|rowe&s;t compa&s;s, have notions of it the mo&s;t &s;ub|lime; though number, if practicable, may be high|ly u&s;eful.</P>
<P>FOR to have but one friend, may &s;ometimes be to have none, or, which is the &s;ame thing, none when we want him. The circum&s;tances of time, and place and ability too, make it proper that we have more than one bottom to venture in. The offices of friend&s;hip are various, to direct our choice, and rectify our mi&s;takes; to &s;u&s;tain our misfortunes, moderate our joys and the like. This may po&s;&s;ibly be better done by the care and en|deavours of &s;everal. Not that I would have friend|&s;hip governed by profit and convenience, a mo|tive &s;o mean can produce nothing extraordinary. There is &s;omething generous in the compo&s;ition, that looks at another man's advantage as much as his own.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="028841_0087_0FDDDABF5D50FD58">
AND that we may not talk without a precedent for what we &s;ay, the &s;ages of old, who&s;e friend&s;hips were &s;o well cultivated, and became &s;o famous as to be handed down to the pre&s;ent time, even theirs were divided into &s;everal &s;treams. The mo&s;t po|lite nations, and their <HI>philo&s;ephers</HI> too, gave us examples of that &s;ort to build upon. It were dif|ficult to determine, ju&s;t how many make a &s;ufficient quantity of friends, &s;ome fix the number to three, others allowing a greater latitude, but this rule will &s;erve us, <HI>the fewer the better;</HI> and he who thinks he has a great number of friends, has mo&s;t rea&s;on to believe he has none. It was a good re|turn of Socrates, when his hou&s;e was thought too little "Would to God I could fill it with true friends;" &s;aid he: After all, if one &s;hould have a barn full, one would wi&s;h for no more than a clo&s;et would hold. Let the matter at lea&s;t turn upon this, &s;etting a&s;ide the rea&s;ons I have offered:&mdash;The dif|ficulty we &s;hall find in the choice of our friends, will make us rejoice we have but few to chu&s;e, Of &s;uch importance is the work, 'tis &s;o hard to &s;ucceed, and &s;o dangerous to mi&s;carry, &s;o &s;evere an inquiry into the inclination and merits of the per|&s;on, and the experience we mu&s;t run through, be|fore we are &s;afe in their hands, will convince us, that to gain three or four in the cour&s;e of our life, is to employ it well. Whence is it, &s;o many friend|&s;hips
<PB N="88" REF="028841_0088_0FDDDAC066F16028">
clapt up on a &s;udden, which have the air of a veteran, not of a raw, undi&s;ciplined affection; and look like the meeting of old friends, not of new ones; whence can it be, the&s;e &s;o promi&s;ing, and kindly advances &s;hould &s;o &s;oon be overturned?

We &s;wing our&s;elves up by main force, and our own weight brings us down again. Would you contract a friend&s;hip that &s;hould la&s;t a long time, be a long time in contracting it.</P>
<P>PLUTARCH thus de&s;cribes the per&s;on a friend &s;hould be. As to the per&s;on of whom we are to make a friend, he mu&s;t be endowed with virtue, as a thing in it&s;elf lovely and de&s;irable, which con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;weet and obliging temper of mind, a lively readine&s;s in doing good offices; than which qual|ifications, nothing is more rarely found in nature. To this a familiar conver&s;ation mu&s;t be added, for the per&s;on whom we de&s;ire to make our friend, mu&s;t not ca&s;ually be picked up at a tavern, or an

<P>FROM a vicious man I &s;hould de&s;ire to &s;tand off altogether. By a vicious man I do not mean one liable to failings, as all men are, but one that acts without any regard to honour and con&s;cience. He's out of his element that makes an engagement that is not &s;upported only by principles of virtue. True friend&s;hip ju&s;tly founded is a ble&s;&s;ing, in which virtue has the &s;ole property. And, as vir|tue has but few temporal rewards to propo&s;e, tho&s;e few are to be found no where el&s;e.</P>
<P>EQUALITY of birth and fortune, is by &s;ome made a point nece&s;&s;ary to a well in&s;tructed friend&s;hip, and it mu&s;t be &s;aid the rule ever to be embraced, if we could, when we plea&s;ed, find as good men of our own rank, as el&s;e where. But con&s;idering there are but few of any rank fit to be cho&s;en, we &s;hould look at the &s;olid foundation of merit, and pa&s;s by mere accompli&s;hments. We make no league with the coat of arms and liveries, but the man, and with that part of the man too, that is con&s;idered ab&s;tractly from both. The&s;e things are not fixed to the freehold.</P>

on earth, which we do to gratify a vain humour? What common humanity or applau&s;e will put us upon, &s;urely, among&s;t friends, is not to be reckon|ed an act of tran&s;cendent kindne&s;s, when it is no more than giving to another &s;elf, and paying of debts. Is there any thing more certainly a due, than what we are engaged to by the alliance of friend&s;hip: Let a man incur the di&s;plea&s;ure of his &s;uperiors, and warmly embark in my &s;ervice, I will own &s;uch a man to be a friend indeed, gen|erous and affectionate, one cannot prai&s;e him too much. Let him open his pur&s;e to one he loves, this comes &s;hort of the other. A man of honour upon a &s;lender friend&s;hip, will do as much as this. To cry up the parting with our pence, for the highe&s;t &s;acrifice that can be paid to friend&s;hip, is the &s;ign of a grovelling &s;pirit, that knows not what is truly noble. The people of old had bet|ter notions of the matter, who would borrow to give others in di&s;tre&s;s, and think they had done no more than their duty.</P>
<P>WHEREFORE, he that fails in this point, is not worth our acquaintance, he that de&s;erts a man to &s;ave his pocket, will never hazard life and reputa|tion in his &s;ervice.

heart of man. It has &s;omething in it noble, di&s;|intere&s;ted, and (if I may be allowed the term) gen|erou&s;ly devout. Repentance indicates our nature fallen, and prayer returns chiefly upon a regard of one's &s;elf. But the exerci&s;e of gratitude &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in Paradi&s;e, when there was no fault to deplore; and will be perpetuated in heaven, when God &s;hall be "all in all."</P>
<P>DEMOSTHENES &s;aid, it becometh him, who re|ceiveth a benefit from another man, for ever to be &s;en&s;ible of it, but him that be&s;towed it, pre&s;ently to forget it. He is unju&s;t, &s;aid Socrates who does not return de&s;erved thanks for any benefit, wheth|er he be a friend or a foe.</P>

<P>HE who receives a good turn, &s;hould never for|get it, he who does one, &s;hould never remember it.</P>

<HEAD>LOVE OF GOD.</HEAD>
<P>THE three great &s;prings of love to God are the&s;e; A clear di&s;covery of what God is in him&s;elf; a lively &s;en&s;e of what he has done for us, and a well grounded hope of what he will do for us. Where the love of God reigns in the affections, it will command all the powers of nature, and all the re&s;t of the pa&s;&s;ions to act &s;uitably to this &s;overeign and all ruling affection of love. The eye will often look up to God in a way of humble dependence; the ear will be attentive to his holy word; the hands will be lifted up to heaven in daily reque&s;ts; the knees will be bent in humble wor&s;hip; all the outward powers will be bui&s;y in doing the will of God, and promoting his glory. He that loves God will keep his commandments, and fulfil every pre&s;ent duty with delight: He will endeav|our to plea&s;e God in all his actions, and watch again&s;t and avoid whatever may offend him; and while the &s;everal outward powers are thus engag|ed, all the inward affections of nature will be em|ployed in corre&s;ponding exerci&s;es. Supreme love will govern all the active train of human pa&s;|&s;ions, and lead them captive to chearful obedience,</P>

HOW &s;en&s;ele&s;s and ab&s;urd is the pretence to love God above all things, if we do not re&s;olve to live upon him as our hope and happine&s;s; if we do not chu&s;e him to be our God and our all, our chief and all &s;ufficient good in this world, and that which is to come! Where the idea of God, as a Being of &s;upreme excellence, doth not reign in the mind, where the will is not determined and fixed on him as our &s;upreme good, men are &s;trangers to that &s;a|cred and divine affection of love. 'Till this be done, we cannot be &s;aid to love God with all our heart.</P>
<P>HOW nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful a practice it is there|fore for a chri&s;tian to meditate often on the tran&s;|cendent perfections and worth of the ble&s;&s;ed God, to &s;urvey his attributes, and his grace in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; to keep in mind a con&s;tant idea of his &s;u|preme excellence, and frequently to repeat and confirm the choice of him as our highe&s;t hopes, our portion and our everla&s;ting good! This will keep the love of God warm at heart, and maintain the divine affection in its primitive life and vig|our. But if our ideas of the adorable and &s;upreme excellence of God grow &s;aint and feeble, and &s;ink lower in the mind; if we lo&s;e the &s;ight of his ami|able glories, the &s;en&s;e of his amazing love in the go&s;pel, his rich promi&s;es, and alluring grace; if we &s;hall abate the fervency of this &s;acred pa&s;&s;ion,

our love to God grows cold by degrees, and &s;uf|fers great and gradual decays.</P>
<P>WHAT thanks do we owe to God, who, though we are &s;o much indebted to him, demands only our love, to pay off all our debts upon this con&s;idera|tion; doth he not &s;hew us, by placing the precept of love above all others, how, poor and in&s;olvent as we are, we may clear our&s;elves of all that we owe him?</P>
<P>IT is &s;urely impo&s;&s;ible to read the life and death of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, without renewing and in|crea&s;ing in our hearts, that love and reverence, and gratitude to him, which is &s;o ju&s;tly due for all he did and &s;uffered for us; every word that fell from his lips is more precious than all the trea&s;ures of the earth, for his are the words of eternal life! They mu&s;t therefore be laid up in our hearts, and be con&s;tantly referred to, on all occa&s;ions, as the rule and direction of all our actions.</P>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible to love God, without de&s;iring to plea&s;e him, and as far as we are able to re&s;emble him; therefore the love of God mu&s;t lead to every virtue in the highe&s;t degree; and we may be &s;ure we do not truly love him, if we content our&s;elves with avoiding flagrant &s;ins, and do not &s;trive in good earne&s;t, to reach the greate&s;t degree of per|fection we are capable of, by his help.</P>

If your love hath any other motive, it is fal&s;e love; if your motive hath any other end, it is &s;elf love. If you neglect your love to your neighbour, in vain you profe&s;s your love to God; for by your love to God, your love to your neigh|bour is acquired; and by your love to your neigh|bour, your love to God is nouri&s;hed.</P>

WE may hate men's vices without any ill will to their per&s;ons; but we cannot help de&s;pi&s;ing tho&s;e that have no kind of virtue to recommend them.</P>
<P>HE that makes any thing his chiefe&s;t good, wherein virtue, rea&s;on and humanity, do not bear a part, can never do the offices of friend&s;hip, ju&s;|tice, or liberality.</P>
<P>A REGARD to decency and the common punctil|ios of life, has been often &s;erviceable to &s;ociety. It has kept many a married couple un&s;eparated, and frequently pre&s;erves a neighbourly intercour&s;e, wherelove and friend&s;hip have both been wanting.</P>
<P>IT is providential that our affection dimini&s;hes in proportion as our friend's power increa&s;es. Affection is of le&s;s importance, whenever a per|&s;on can &s;upport him&s;elf. It is on this account that younger brothers are oft beloved more than their elders; and that Benjamin is the favourite.</P>
<P>"LOVE worketh no ill to his neighbour," therefore, if we have true benevolence, we will never do any thing injurious to individuals, or to &s;ociety.

<HEAD>MARRIAGE.</HEAD>
<P>MARRIAGE is certainly a condition, upon which the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of life does very much depend; more than indeed mo&s;t people think beforehand. To be confined to live with one perpetually, for whom we have no liking and e&s;teem, mu&s;t certainly be an unea&s;y &s;tate. There had need be a great many good qualities to recon|cile a con&s;tant conver&s;ation with one, where there is &s;ome &s;hare of kindne&s;s, but without love, the very be&s;t of all good qualities will never make a con&s;tant conver&s;ation ea&s;y and delightful. And whence proceed tho&s;e innumerable dome&s;tic mi&s;e|ries,
<PB N="136" REF="028841_0136_0FDDDB34B6899BE0">
that plague and utterly confound &s;o many fam|ilies, but from want of love and kindne&s;s in the wife or hu&s;band; from the&s;e come their neglect and carele&s;s management of affairs at home, and their profu&s;e extravagant expen&s;es abroad. In a word, it is not ea&s;y, as it is not needful, to recount the evils that ari&s;e abundantly, from the want of conjugal affection only. And &s;ince this is &s;o cer|tain, a man or woman runs the mo&s;t fearful hazard that can be, who marries without their affection in them&s;elves, and without good a&s;&s;urances of it in the other.</P>
<P>LET you love advice before you chu&s;e, and your choice be fixed before you marry. Remember the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of your life depends upon this one act, and that nothing but death can di&s;|&s;olve the knot.</P>
<P>A SINGLE life is doubtle&s;s preferable to a marri|ed one, where prudence and affection do not ac|company the choice; but where they do, there is no terre&s;trial happine&s;s equal to the married &s;tate.</P>
<P>THERE cannot be too near an equality, too exact a harmony betwixt a married couple; it is a &s;tep of &s;uch weight as calls for all our fore&s;ight and penetration, and, e&s;pecially the temper and education mu&s;t be attended to.

<P>TRUE merit is not afraid of being effaced by that of others.

This behaviour vi&s;ibly proceeds from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s in them, that other people's virtues upbraid their own want of it.</P>
<P>WE ought not to judge of men's merits by their qualifications, but by the u&s;e they make of them.</P>
<P>IT is a thing exceedingly rare to di&s;tingui&s;h vir|tue and fortune. The mo&s;t impious, if pro&s;perous, are always applauded; the mo&s;t virtuous, if un|pro&s;perous, are &s;ure to be de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>

<P>IT is true greatne&s;s that con&s;titutes glory, and virtue is the cau&s;e of both. But vice and igno|rance taint the blood, and an unworthy behaviour degrades and di&s;ennobles the man, more than birth and fortune aggrandize and exalt him.</P>

<HEAD>MODESTY AND IMPUDENCE.</HEAD>
<P>MODESTY has a natural tendency to conceal a man's talents, as impudence di&s;plays them to the utmo&s;t, and has been the only cau&s;e why many have ri&s;en in the world, under all the di&s;advantages of low birth and little merit. Such indolence and incapacity is there in the generality of mankind, that they are apt to receive a man for whatever he has a mind to put him&s;elf off for, and admit his over bearing airs, as proofs of that merit which he a&s;&s;umes to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>A DECENT a&s;&s;urance &s;eems to be the natural at|tendant on virtue; and few men can di&s;tingui&s;h impudence from it; as, on the other hand, diffi|dence being the natural re&s;ult of vice and folly, has drawn di&s;grace upon mode&s;ty, which in out|ward appearance &s;o nearly re&s;embles it.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="028841_0153_0FDDDB5EA6575A78">
As impudence, though really a vice, has the &s;ame effect upon a man's fortune, as if it were a virtue, &s;o we may ob&s;erve, that it is almo&s;t as dif|ficult to be obtained, and is, in that re&s;pect, di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from all the other vices which are acquir|ed with little pains, and continually increa&s;e up|on indulgence. Many a man being &s;en&s;ible that mode&s;ty is exceedingly prejudicial to him in making his fortune, has re&s;olved to be impudent, and put a bold face upon the matter; but 'tis ob&s;erv|able, that &s;uch people have &s;eldom &s;ucceeded in their attempts, but have been obliged to relap&s;e into their primitive mode&s;ty. Nothing carries a man through the world, like a true, genuine, nat|ural impudence; its counterfeit is good for no|thing, nor can ever &s;upport it&s;elf. If any thing can give a mode&s;t man more a&s;&s;urance, it mu&s;t be &s;ome advantages of fortune which chance procured to him. Riches naturally gain a man a favourable reception in the world, and give merit a double lu&s;tre, when a per&s;on is endowed with it. 'Tis wonderful to ob&s;erve what airs of &s;uperiority fools and knaves, with large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, give them&s;elves, above men of the greate&s;t merit, in poverty. Nor do the men of merit make any &s;trong oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e u&s;urpations, but rather &s;eem to favour them by the mode&s;ty of their behaviour.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="028841_0154_0FDDDB5EDC992AC0">
TO make wi&s;dom agree with impudence, is as difficult as to reconcile vice and mode&s;ty. The&s;e are the reflexions which have occurred upon this &s;ubject of mode&s;ty and impudence, and I hope the reader will not be di&s;plea&s;ed to &s;ee them wrought into the following allegory.</P>
<P>JUPITER in the beginning joined Virtue, Wi&s;|dom and Confidence together; and Vice, Folly and Diffidence; and thus connected, &s;ent them into the world. But though he thought he had matched them with great judgment, and &s;aid, that Confi|dence was the natural companion of Virtue, and that Vice de&s;erved to be attended with Diffidence. They had not gone far before di&s;&s;en&s;ion aro&s;e among them. Wi&s;dom, who was the guide of the one company, was always accu&s;tomed, before &s;he ventured on any road, however beaten, to exam|ine it carefully, to enquire whither it led; what dangers, difficulties, or hindrances might po&s;&s;ibly, or probably occur in it. In the&s;e deliberations &s;he u&s;ually con&s;umed &s;ome time, which delay was very di&s;plea&s;ing to Confidence, who was always inclined to hurry on, without much forethought or deliber|ation, in the fir&s;t road he met. Wi&s;dom and Vir|tue were in&s;eparable; but Confidence one day following his impetuous nature, advanced a con|&s;iderable way before his guides and companions, and not feeling any want of their company, he
<PB N="155" REF="028841_0155_0FDDDB61DE09C9F0">
never enquired after them, nor ever met with them more. In like manner, the other &s;ociety, though joined by Jupiter, di&s;agreed and &s;eparat|ed. As Folly &s;aw very little way before her, &s;he had nothing to determine concerning the goodne&s;s of roads, nor could give the preference to one above another, and their want of re&s;olution increa&s;ed by Diffidence, who, with her doubts and &s;cruples always retarded the journey. This was a great annoyance to Vice, who loved not to hear of difficulties and delays, and was never &s;atisfied without his full career in whatever his in|clinations led him to. Folly, he knew, though &s;he hearkened to Diffidence, would be ea&s;ily ma|naged when alone, therefore, as a vicious hor&s;e throws its rider, he openly beat away this controller of his plea&s;ures, and proceeded on his journey with Folly, from whom he is in&s;eparable. Confidence and Diffidence being after this manner both thrown loo&s;e from their re&s;pective companions, wandered for &s;ome time; till at la&s;t chance led them at the &s;ame time to the &s;ame village. Confidence went directly up to the great hou&s;e, which belonged to Wealth, the lord of the village, and without &s;taying for a porter, intruded him&s;elf immediately into the innermo&s;t appartments, where he found Vice and Folly were received before him. He joined the
<PB N="156" REF="028841_0156_0FDDDB63436E24B0">
train, recommended him&s;elf very quickly to his landlord, and entered into &s;uch familiarity with Vice, that he was enli&s;ted in the &s;ame company with Folly. They were frequent gue&s;ts with Wealth, and from that moment in&s;eparable. Dif|fidence in the mean time, not daring to approach the great hou&s;e, accepted of an invitation from one of the tenants, and entering the cottage found Wi&s;dom and Virtue, who, being repul&s;ed by the landlord, had retired thither.</P>
<P>VIRTUE took compa&s;&s;ion on her, and Wi&s;dom found from her temper, that &s;he would ea&s;ily im|prove, &s;o they admitted her into their &s;ociety. Accordingly by their means, &s;he altered, in a little time, &s;omewhat of her manner; and becoming much more amiable and engaging, was now cal|led by the name of Mode&s;ty.</P>
<P>AS ill company has a greater effect than good, Confidence, though more refractory to council and example, degenerated &s;o far by the &s;ociety of Vice and Folly, as to pa&s;s by the name of Impudence.</P>
<P>MANKIND, who &s;aw the&s;e &s;ocieties as Jupiter fir&s;t joined them, and knew nothing of the&s;e mu|tual di&s;&s;en&s;ions, are thereby led into &s;trange mi&s;|takes, and whenever they &s;ee Impudence, make ac|count of Virtue and Wi&s;dom; and oft when they ob&s;erve Mode&s;ty, call her attendants Vice and Folly.</P>

<P>IT has been &s;aid, that when Jove created the pa&s;&s;ions, he a&s;&s;igned every one of them its de&s;tined abode; mode&s;ty was forgotten, and when &s;he was introduced to him, he knew not where to place her; &s;he was therefore ordered to con&s;ort with all the re&s;t; ever &s;ince that time &s;he is in&s;eparable from them; &s;he is the friend of truth, and betrays the lie that dares attack it; &s;he is in a &s;trict and inti|mate unity with love, &s;he always attends, and fre|quently di&s;covers and proclaims it; love, in a

grace and acceptance to all that its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or &s;ays or does, &s;o poverty creates di&s;e&s;teem, &s;corn and pre|judice to all the undertakings of the indigent. The nece&s;&s;itous man has neither hands, lips, nor un|der&s;tanding for his own, or his friends u&s;e; but is in the &s;ame condition with the &s;ick, with this dif|ference only, that his is an infection no man will relieve, or a&s;&s;i&s;t; or if he does, 'tis &s;eldom with as much pity as contempt, and rather for the o&s;tenta|tion of the phy&s;ician, than compa&s;&s;ion on the pa|tient: It is a circum&s;tance, wherein a man finds all the good he de&s;erves inacce&s;&s;ible, all the ill una|voidable; under the&s;e pre&s;&s;ures, the poor man &s;peaks with he&s;itation, undertakes with irre&s;olu|tion, and acts with di&s;appointment; he is &s;lighted in men's conver&s;ations, overlooked in their a&s;&s;em|blies, &amp;c.

mind may be formed by the be&s;t of principles, and his actions guided by the highe&s;t rules of Chri&s;tian benevolence; which perhaps was the only cau&s;e of his not thriving in temporary wealth in an equal degree with &s;ome of his cotemporaries. While &s;ome who live as "without God in the world," thoughtle&s;s of every concern but accumu|lating wealth, are e&s;teemed of the fir&s;t rank in the community, and the mo&s;t able members of &s;ocie|ty.

<P>AMIDST the mi&s;eries to which human life is liable, nothing is &s;o generally dreaded as poverty; &s;ince it expo&s;es mankind to di&s;tre&s;&s;es that are but little pitied, and to the contempt of tho&s;e who have no natural endowments &s;uperior to our own. Every other difficulty or danger, a man is enabled to encounter with courage and alacrity, becau&s;e he knows that his &s;ucce&s;s will meet with applau&s;e, for bravery will always find its admirers; but in poverty every virtue is ob&s;cured, and no conduct can entirely &s;ecure a man from reproach. Cheer|fulne&s;s, (as an admirable author ob&s;erves) if here in&s;en&s;ibility, and dejection, &s;ullenne&s;s; its hard|&s;hips are without honour, and labours without reward. Notwith&s;tanding this, there is no &s;tation more favourable to the growth of virtue, where the &s;eeds of it are previou&s;ly &s;own in the mind.
<PB N="188" REF="028841_0188_0FDDDBB8A614FA48">
But when poverty is felt in the utmo&s;t extreme, it then becomes exce&s;&s;ively dangerous, and &s;ome deviations from rectitude, are perhaps impo&s;&s;ible to be avoided.</P>
<P>VICE is covered by wealth, and virtue by pov|erty.</P>

<HEAD>PRAISE.</HEAD>
<P>PRAISE is the tribute due to virtuous deeds, and though it is heartily to be de&s;pi&s;ed, when it comes from the lips of bad men, when we have not a true title to it; yet it is not to be e&s;teemed di&s;|agreeable, or undi&s;creditable when be&s;towed upon occa&s;ions where it is really due, and by tho&s;e who are really judges of virtue. Prai&s;e is the reward of noble actions: What is more animating to our commanders both by &s;ea and land, than the a&s;&s;ur|ance of their country's applau&s;e, for their heroic behaviour. Prai&s;e is only to be given when truly merited, and then not in the pre&s;ence of the party to whom it is due. When Telemachus repaired to the a&s;&s;embly of the confederate kings, after the death of Adra&s;tus, and the Daunians de&s;ired peace, we are told, that as &s;oon as they e&s;pied him, they

were all hu&s;hed in expectation to hear him di&s;|cour&s;e; this made him blu&s;h, and he could not be prevailed upon to &s;peak. The prai&s;es that were given him by public acclamations, on account of his late action, added to his ba&s;hfulne&s;s &s;o, that he would gladly have hid him&s;elf. At length, he de|&s;ired as a favour, that they would de&s;i&s;t from com|mending him: Not but that I am a lover of prai&s;e, &s;aid he, e&s;pecialy when it comes from &s;uch good judges of virtue; but, I am afraid of loving it too much. Prai&s;es are apt to corrupt men; they fill them full of them&s;elves, and render them vain and pre&s;umptuous; we ought equally to merit and decline them; there is a great likene&s;s between the ju&s;te&s;t and the fal&s;e&s;t prai&s;es. Ju&s;t prai&s;es are &s;uch as you will give me in my ab&s;ence, if I am &s;o happy as to de&s;erve them. If you believe me to be really good, you ought al&s;o to believe that I am willing to be mode&s;t, and would fear vanity; &s;pare me, therefore, if you have any e&s;teem for me, and do not prai&s;e me as if I were a man fond of &s;uch things. A man ought to blu&s;h, when he is prai&s;ed for per|fections he does not po&s;&s;e&s;s. Be careful how you receive prai&s;e; from good men neither avoid it nor glory in it; from bad men neither de&s;ire nor ex|pect it.

Let your prayers be ever &s;o proper in the form and expre&s;&s;ion, or let your heart ac|company them with a devotion ever &s;o inten&s;e, &s;till be very careful to avoid the dangerous error of imagining that any merit ari&s;es from the mo&s;t perfect performance of them. They become accep|table to God through Chri&s;t alone; and are the means, indeed, to make you good; but the good|ne&s;s it&s;elf is not in them, no more than a favour among men can be &s;aid to be de&s;erved, becau&s;e a&s;ked with humility, propriety and elegance.

For, in fine, He is the only debtor who thinks him&s;elf obliged for the demands that are made upon him. He is the only one that pays what we never lent him. The more he &s;ees us pre&s;s him, the more liberal he is. He even gives that he does not owe.

A long prayer and a &s;hort differ not in their ca|pacities of being accepted; for both of them take their value, according to the fervency of &s;pirit, and the charity of the prayer. That prayer which is &s;hort, by rea&s;on of an impatient &s;pirit, dullne&s;s, &s;light of holy things, or indifferency of de&s;ires, is very often criminal, always imperfect; and that prayer which is long out of o&s;tentation, &s;uper&s;ti|tion, or a trifling &s;pirit, is as criminal and imper|fect, as the other in their &s;everal in&s;tances.</P>

<P>READING is to the mind what exerci&s;e is to the body, as by one, health is pre&s;erved, &s;trenghened and invigorated; by the other, virtue, (which is the health of the mind) is kept alive, cheri&s;hed and confirmed. There are per&s;ons who &s;eldom take a book in their hand, but to di&s;cover the faults it may in their opinion contain; and merit of the work is the lea&s;t of their con&s;idera|tion; they can pa&s;s over many &s;ine &s;entiments, and rhetorical expre&s;&s;ions, without the lea&s;t regard, but to whatever they think ob&s;cure, ab&s;urd, or imper|tinent, they are &s;ure to afford no quarter: Many perfections cannot atone for a few imperfections with them, they mu&s;t have a perfect piece or none; &s;uch per&s;ons ought not to read at all, they are not fit to judge of what they do read.

everyman of &s;en&s;e and candour, who reads in order to reap the benefit of reading, will give merit its due, wherever he finds it, and be cautious how he commends.

<HEAD>RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>RELIGION is a thing much talked of but little under&s;tood; much pretended to, but very little practi&s;ed; and the rea&s;on why it is &s;o ill practi&s;ed, is, becau&s;e it is &s;o little under&s;tood; knowledge, therefore, mu&s;t precede religion, &s;ince it is nece&s;|&s;ary to be wi&s;e, in order to be virtuous, it mu&s;t be known to whom, and upon what account duty is owing, otherwi&s;e it never an be rightly paid. It mu&s;t therefore be con&s;idered, that God is the object of all religion, and that the &s;oul is the &s;ub|ject wherein it exi&s;ts and re&s;ides. From the &s;oul it mu&s;t proceed, and to God it mu&s;t be directed, as to that Almighty Being who&s;e power alone could create a rational &s;oul, and who&s;e goodne&s;s only could move him to make it capable of an eter|nal felicity, which infinite bounty of God has
<PB N="209" REF="028841_0209_0FDDDBE366F655B0">
laid a perpetual obligation upon the &s;oul to a con|&s;tant love, obedience and adoration of him. And to an undoubted a&s;&s;urance, that the &s;ame power and goodne&s;s that created man, will for ever pre|&s;erve him and protect him, if he per&s;everes in the &s;incere performance of his duty. The body can have no other &s;hare in religion, than by its ge&s;tures to repre&s;ent and di&s;cover the bent and inclination of the mind, which repre&s;entations al&s;o are but too often fal&s;e and treacherous, deluding tho&s;e that be|hold them, into the opinion of a &s;aint, but truly di&s;covering a notorious hypocrite to God, who fees how di&s;tant his intentions are from his preten|ces. People are as much deceived them&s;elves, as they deceive others, who think to u&s;e religion as they do their be&s;t clothes, only wear it to church and on &s;undays, to appear fine, and make a &s;hew, and with them, as &s;oon as they come home again, lay it a&s;ide carefully, for fear of wearing it out: That religion is good for nothing that is made of &s;o &s;light a &s;tuff, as will not endure wearing, which ought to be as con&s;tant a covering for the &s;oul, as the &s;kin is to the body, not to be divided from it; divi&s;ion being the ruin of both. Nor mu&s;t it be thought that religion con&s;i&s;ts only in bending the knees, which is a &s;itting po&s;ture of humility; but in the &s;ervent and humble adoration of the &s;oul
<PB N="210" REF="028841_0210_0FDDDBE68FBF1120">
Nor in the lifting up of the hands and eyes, but in the wormth of the affection. Outward ge&s;tures and decent behaviour are things very &s;it and rea|&s;onable, being all that the body can pay; but it is inward &s;incerity alone that can render them both acceptable. Much le&s;s does religion con&s;i&s;t in di&s;mal looks and &s;our faces, which only &s;hews that it is very unpalatable to tho&s;e who make them; and it &s;eems as if they were &s;wallowing of &s;omething that went grievou&s;ly again&s;t their &s;tomachs. 'Tis likewi&s;e to be con&s;idered, the frequency and fer|vency of prayers gives it acceptance, not the length of them. That one prayer rightly addre&s;&s;ed to God from a well di&s;po&s;ed mind, is more effica|cious than ten &s;ermons carele&s;sly heard, and more carele&s;sly practi&s;ed. But hearing being a much ea&s;ier duty then praying, becau&s;e it can often change into &s;leeping, is therefore preferred to it, by a great many people. But if, in the end, their profound ignorance will not excu&s;e them, I am &s;ure their &s;tupid ob&s;tinacy never will. But there are &s;o many virtues required in order to praying rightly, that people think, perhaps, that it would take up too much time and pains to acquire them. And they are much in the right, if they think their prayers will be in&s;ignificant without them, and that an ill man can never pray well, and to purpo&s;e, for the

&s;tream will always partake of the fountain. And if the mind, which is the fountain of all our addre&s;|&s;es to God, be vitious and impure, the prayers which proceed from it, mu&s;t needs be &s;ullied with the &s;ame polutions. But, on the contrary if the mind be once made virtuous, all that proceeds from it will be plea&s;ing and accepted. And as to dejected looks and a &s;orrowful countenance, they are no wi&s;e graceful in religion, which is &s;o far from being a melancholy thing, that it can never appear di&s;plea&s;ing, or tire&s;ome to a mind where wi&s;dom and virtue do not fir&s;t &s;eem trouble&s;ome; for wi&s;dom in&s;tructing the &s;oul to act rea&s;onably, in&s;tructs it likewi&s;e to &s;erve and obey God readily and chearfully; for that which appears rea&s;onable to a wi&s;e man, will always appear delightful; and religion is that very &s;ame rea&s;on and wi&s;dom, who&s;e ways are ways of plea&s;antne&s;s, and all who&s;e paths are peace.</P>

RELIGION is &s;o far from debarring men of any innocent plea&s;ure or comfort of human life, that it purifies the plea&s;ures of it, and renders them more grateful and generous.

The body is but the cabinet, the &s;oul is the jewel. The body is but the dwelling, the &s;oul the inhabitant. The body is but the lanthorn, the &s;oul or &s;pirit the candle of the Lord, that burns in it. And &s;eeing there is &s;uch difference between the &s;oul and the body in re&s;pect of excellency, &s;ure our better part challen|ges our greater care and diligence, to make provi|&s;ion for it. Bodily provi&s;ion is but half provi&s;ion; it is but one part, and that the meaner and more ignoble too, if we con&s;ider only the time of this life; But if we con&s;ider a future &s;tate of endle&s;s duration after this life, then bodily provi&s;ion will

appear to be but no provi&s;ion at all, in compari&s;on, there being no proportion between &s;o &s;hort a period of time, and the infinite ages of eternity. Our great partiality towards our bodies, and neglect of our &s;ouls, &s;hews clearly what part we prefer; we are careful enough in not wounding or maiming our bodies; but we make bold to la&s;h and wound our &s;ouls daily. We are indu&s;trious enough to pre&s;erve our bodies from &s;lavery, &amp;c. but we make nothing of &s;uffering our &s;ouls to be &s;laves and drudges to lu&s;t, and to live in the vile&s;t bondage to the mo&s;t degenerate of creatures, the devil.</P>
<P>WE arm and defend our bodies, and our &s;ouls have as much need of armour as they, for the life of a Chri&s;tian is a continual warfare, and we have potent and vigilant enemies to encounter withal, the devil, the world, and this corrupt fle&s;h we carry about with us. We had need therefore, to put on the whole armour of God that we may be able to &s;tand in the evil day, and having done all may &s;tand, having our&s;elves girt with truth, and having the brea&s;t plate of righteou&s;ne&s;s; above all, taking the &s;hield of faith, and for a hemlet, the hope of &s;alvation, and the &s;word of the &s;pirit, which is the word of God.&mdash;Ephes. vi. 13, 14.</P>

<P>A LIE is a de&s;perate cowardice.&mdash;It is to fear man and brave God.</P>

<L>Truth be your guide, di&s;dain ambition's call,</L>

<P>NOTHING appears &s;o low and mean as lying and di&s;&s;imulations; and it is ob&s;ervable that only weak animals endeavour to &s;upply by craft the defects of &s;trength. Virtue &s;corns a lie for its cover, and truth needs no orator.</P>

SINCERITY of heart, and integrity of life, are the great and indi&s;pen&s;ible ornaments of human nature.</P>
<P>THAT kind of deceit which is commonly laid, and &s;mootly carried on under di&s;gui&s;e of friend&s;hip, is of all others the mo&s;t impious and dete&s;table.</P>
<P>NOR to intend what you &s;peak, is to give your heart the lie with your tongue; not to perform what you promi&s;e, is to give your tongue the lie with your actions.</P>
<P>NOTHING can be more unju&s;t or ungenerous, than to play upon the belief of a harmle&s;s per&s;on; to make him &s;uffer for his good opinion, and fare the wor&s;e for thinking me hone&s;t.</P>
<P>IT would be more obliging to &s;ay plainly, we cannot do what is de&s;ired, than to amu&s;e people with fair words; which often put them upon fal&s;e mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>GREAT men mu&s;t go and meet truth, if they are de&s;irous to know it; for none will carry it to them.</P>
<P>THERE is no vice that doth &s;o cover a man with &s;hame, as to be fal&s;e and perfidious.</P>
<P>IT is ea&s;y to tell a lie, hard to tell but a lie. One lie needs many more to maintain it.</P>

heaven, and &s;wears by the Almighty name, that "<HI>time &s;hall be no longer.</HI>" Then abu&s;ed opportu|nities will never return, and new opportunities will never more be offered. Then &s;hould negli|gent mortals wi&s;h ever &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately for a few hours&mdash;a few moments only&mdash;to be thrown back from the opening eternity; thou&s;ands of worlds would not be able to procure the grant.</P>
<P>A WISE man counts his minutes. He lets no time &s;lip, for time is life; which he makes long, by the good hu&s;bandry, of a right u&s;e and applica|tion of it.</P>
<P>MAKE the mo&s;t of your minutes, &s;ays Aurelius, and be good for &s;omething while you can.</P>
<P>KNOW the true value of time; &s;natch, &s;eize and enjoy every moment of it. No idlene&s;s no lazi|ne&s;s, no procra&s;tination; never put off till tomor|row what you can do to day.</P>
<P>WE &s;hould read over our lives as well as books, take a &s;urvey of our actions, and make an in&s;pec|tion into the divi&s;ion of our time. King Alfred (that truly great and wi&s;e monarch) is recorded to have divided the day and night into three parts: Eight hours he allotted to eat and &s;leep in, eight for bu&s;ine&s;s and recreation, and eight he dedicat|ed to &s;tudy and prayer.</P>

TO come but once into the world, and trifle away our right u&s;e of it, making that a burthen which was given for a ble&s;&s;ing is &s;trange infatuation.</P>
<P>TIME is what we want mo&s;t, but what we u&s;e wor&s;t; for which we mu&s;t all account, when time &s;hall be no more.</P>
<P>THERE is but little need to drive away that time by fooli&s;h diverti&s;ements, which flies away &s;o &s;wiftly of it&s;elf, and when once gone, can nev|er be recalled.</P>
<P>AN idle per&s;on is a kind of mon&s;ter in the cre|ation; all nature is bui&s;y about him. How wretch|ed is it to hear people complain, that the day hangs heavy upon them, that they do not know what to do with them&s;elves. How mon&s;trous are &s;uch ex|pre&s;&s;ions among creatures, who can apply them|&s;elves to the duties of religion and meditation; to the reading of u&s;eful books; who may exerci&s;e them&s;elves in the pur&s;uits of knowledge and vir|tue, and every hour of their lives, make them|&s;elves wi&s;er and better.</P>
<P>SHOULD the greate&s;t part of people &s;it down, and draw a particular account of their time, what a &s;hameful bill would it be? So much extraordinary for eating, drinking and &s;leeping, beyond what nature requires; &s;o much in revelling and wanton|ne&s;s; &s;o much for the recovery of la&s;t night's in|temperance; &s;o much for gaming, plays and ma&s;|querades;
<PB N="251" REF="028841_0251_0FDDDC4BB7BB6908">
&s;o much in paying and receiving formal and impertinent vi&s;its, in idle and fooli&s;h prating, in cen&s;uring and reviling our neighbours; &s;o much in dre&s;&s;ing, and talking of fa&s;hions; and &s;o much lo&s;t and wa&s;ted in doing nothing.</P>
<P>THERE is no man but hath a &s;oul, and, if he will look carefully to that, he need not complain for want of bu&s;ine&s;s. Where there are &s;o many corruptions to mortify, &s;o many inclinations to watch over, &s;o many temptations to re&s;i&s;t, the graces of God to improve, and former neglects of all the&s;e to lament, &s;ure he can never want &s;uffi|cient employment. For all the&s;e require time, and &s;o men at their deaths find; for tho&s;e who have lived carele&s;sly, and wa&s;ted their time, would then give them all to redeem it.</P>
<P>IT was a memorable practice of Ve&s;pa&s;ian, thro' the whole cour&s;e of his life; he called him&s;elf to an account every night for the actions of the pa&s;t day, and &s;o often as he found he had &s;kipped any one day without doing &s;ome good, he entered upon his diary this memorial, "<HI>I have lo&s;t a day.</HI>"</P>
<P>IF time, like money, could be laid by, while one was not u&s;ing it&mdash;there might be &s;ome excu&s;e for the idlene&s;s of half the world&mdash;but yet not a full one; for even this would be &s;uch an economy, as the living on a principle &s;um, with|out making it purcha&s;e intere&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="028841_0252_0FDDDC5007C113B0">
TIME is one of the mo&s;t precious jewels which we po&s;&s;e&s;s; but its true value is &s;eldom known till it is near a clo&s;e, and when it is not in our power to redeem it. The right improvement of time is of the greate&s;t con&s;equence to mankind. The pre&s;ent moment is only ours. The pre&s;ent moment calls for di&s;patch; and, if neglected, it is a great chance if ever we get another opportunity. To day we live, tomorrow we may die. Be&s;ides, we have a great work to do, and an appointed time in which it mu&s;t be done. The uncertainty of this time adds much to its brevity; the velocity of it urges its improvement the more. Seneca ob&s;erves, We all complain of the &s;hortne&s;s of time, but &s;pend it in &s;uch a manner, as if we had too much.</P>
<P>THE time we live ought not to be computed to by the number of years, but by the u&s;e which has been made of it: It is not the extent of ground, but the yearly rent which gives the value to the e&s;tate. Wretched and thoughtle&s;s creatures! in the only place where covetou&s;ne&s;s were a virtue, we turn prodigals! nothing lies upon our hands with &s;uch unea&s;ine&s;s, nor has there been &s;o many devices for any one thing, as to make time glide away imper|ceptibly and to no purpo&s;e. A &s;hilling &s;hall be hoarded up with care whil&s;t that which is above the price of an e&s;tate, is flung away with di&s;regard and contempt.</P>
