<HI>Georgia,</HI> and one or two more having taken Orders, the Intere&s;t of METHODISM, as it was then and is now term'd, had vi|&s;ibly declined, and very few of this repu|tedly mad Way were left at the Univer&s;ity. This &s;omewhat di&s;couraged me at Times, but the Lord JESUS &s;upported my Soul, and made me ea&s;y by giving me a &s;trong Convic|tion, that I was where He would have me to be&punc; My Degree I &s;oon found was of Service to me, as it gave me acce&s;s to tho&s;e I could not be free with when in an inferi|or Station, and as Opportunity offer'd, I was enabled to conver&s;e with them about the Things which belonged to the Kingdom of GOD.&mdash;The Sub&s;criptions for the poor Pri|&s;oners (which amounted to about <HI>Forty Pounds</HI> per Annum) were &s;oon put into my Hands&mdash;Two or Three &s;mall Charity Schools, maintained by the <HI>Methodi&s;ts,</HI> were under my more immediate In&s;pection, which, with the Time I &s;pent in following my Studies, private Retirement, and religi|ous Conver&s;e, &s;weetly filled up the whole of my Day, and kept me from that unac|countable, but too common, Complaint of having any Time hang upon my Hands.

<P>In a &s;hort Time I began to be more than content in my pre&s;ent State of Life. God was plea&s;ed to be with me of a Truth,&mdash;My Strength was proportioned to my Day, and I had thoughts of abiding at the Univer&s;ity, at lea&s;t for &s;ome Years, to fini&s;h my Studies, and do what good I could among&s;t the poor de&s;pi&s;ed Methodi&s;ts.&mdash;But <HI>God's Thoughts are not as Man's Thoughts, neither are our Ways as his Ways.</HI>&mdash;By a Se|ries of unfore&s;een, unexpected and un&s;ought

for Providences, I was called in a &s;hort Time from my beloved Retirement to take a Journey to the Metropolis of <HI>England.</HI>&mdash;Whil&s;t I was an under-Graduate, among&s;t other religious Friends, I was very intimate with one Mr. <HI>B&mdash;n,</HI> a profe&s;&s;ed <HI>Me|thodi&s;t,</HI> who had lately taken Orders, and was Curate at the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London.</HI>&mdash;With him, when ab&s;ent, I frequently corre&s;pond|ed, and when pre&s;ent took &s;weet Councel, and walked to the Hou&s;e of God as Friends. He mention'd me to that late good and great Man Sir <HI>John Philips</HI>&mdash;And being called down for a while into <HI>Hamp&s;hire,</HI> he wrote to me to be of good Courage, and in the Strength of GOD, bid me ha&s;ten to Town to officiate in his Ab&s;ence, and be refre&s;hed with the Sight and Conver&s;ation of many who loved me for CHRIST'S &s;ake, and had for a long Time de&s;ired to &s;ee me&mdash;</P>

to the God of all Grace to be my Guide and my Comforter; at the &s;ame Time I could not help prai&s;ing him for chang|ing my Heart and calling me to preach the Go&s;pel at a Place to which, not many Years ago, I would have given much Money, would my Circum&s;tances have permitted, to have went up and &s;een a Play. In the Evening I reach'd the Tower, and was kindly received by my dear Friend&mdash;The remain|der of the Week was &s;pent in vi&s;iting Sir <HI>John Philips,</HI> &amp;c. who were too glad to &s;ee me.&mdash;But God &s;ent me &s;omething to balla&s;t it.&mdash;For as I pa&s;&s;ed along the Streets many came out of their Shops, admiring to &s;ee &s;o young a Per&s;on in a Gown and Ca&s;&s;ock. One I remember in particular cryed out, "<HI>There's a Boy Par&s;on.</HI>"&mdash;which, as it &s;erv'd to mortify my Pride, put me al&s;o up|on turning that apo&s;tolical Exhortation into Prayer, "<HI>Let no Man de&s;pi&s;e thy Youth.</HI>"</P>
<P>On <HI>Sunday Augu&s;t</HI> 8th, in the Afternoon I preached at <HI>Bi&s;hop-Gate</HI> Church, the large|ne&s;s of which, and the Congregation toge|ther, at fir&s;t a little da&s;hed me; but by ad|verting to God, and con&s;idering in who&s;e Name I was about to &s;peak, my Mind was calm'd and I was enabled to preach with

Power.&mdash;The Effect was immediate and vi&s;ible to all; for as I went up the Stairs al|mo&s;t all &s;eem to &s;neer at me on Account of my Youth; but they &s;oon grew &s;erious, and exceedingly attentive, and after I came down &s;hewed me great tokens of Re&s;pect, ble&s;|&s;ed me as I pa&s;s'd along, and made great Enquiry who I was&mdash;The Que&s;tion no one could an&s;wer, for I was quite a Stranger.

<P>Here I continued for the Space of two Months, reading Prayers twice a Week, cate|chi&s;ing and preaching once, be&s;ides vi&s;iting the Soldiers in the Infirmary and Barracks, daily. I al&s;o read Prayers every evening at <HI>Wapping Chapel,</HI> and preached at <HI>Ludgate</HI> Pri|&s;on every Tue&s;day&mdash;God was plea&s;ed to give me favour in the Eyes of the Inhabitants of the Tower&mdash;The Chapel was crowded on Lord's Days&mdash;Religious Friends from divers Parts of the Town attended the Word, and &s;everal young Men came on Lord's Day Morning, under &s;erious Im|pre&s;&s;ions, to hear me di&s;cour&s;e about the <HI>New-Birth, and the Nece&s;&s;ity of renouncing all in Affection, in order to follow JESUS CHRIST.</HI></P>

Whil&s;t the P&s;alm was &s;inging, after Prayers, the Mini&s;ter came to my Seat, and asked
<PB N="19" REF="005886_0018_10275DF10E6B21B0">

The next Day there was another Lecture at <HI>St. Stephens.</HI> Many crowded thither in Ex|pectation of hearing me again. The Lec|turer asked me to preach as the other did the Day before. I again complyed, and the Alarm given here was &s;o general, that on the following Lord's Day, many of all denominations were obliged to return from the Churches where I preach'd, for want of Room. Afterwards I was called by the Mayor to preach before him and the Cor|poration. And for &s;ome Time following, I preached all the Lectures on the Week Days, and twice on <HI>Sundays,</HI> be&s;ides vi&s;iting the Religious Societies. The Word, thro' the Mighty Power of God, was &s;harper than a two edged Sword.

<P>During my &s;tay at <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> I made a lit|tle Elopement to <HI>Bath,</HI> where I was kindly received by a Dear Friend the Rev'd Mr. <HI>Chapman,</HI> and &s;ome Elect and honourable Women who befriended the <HI>Oxford</HI> Me|thodi&s;ts.

It was now about the middle of <HI>February.

Having &s;taid about ten Days at the Univer&s;ity, I took, as I thought, my la&s;t Farewell of my Dear Friends, and came up to <HI>London</HI> in the Beginning of <HI>March,</HI> in order to wait up|on <HI>James Oglethorp</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q;</ABBR> and the Honourable <HI>Tru&s;tees.</HI> I was kindly received by both.

<P>I continued at <HI>London</HI> about three Weeks, waiting for Mr. <HI>Oglethorp,</HI> who expected to &s;ail every Day. In this Sea&s;on I preach|ed more frequently than when there before. Many more came to hear me, and the la&s;t <HI>Sunday</HI> I was in Town, I read Prayers twice, and preached four Times.&mdash;But find|ing Mr. <HI>Oglethorp</HI> was not likely to go for &s;ome time, and having lain under particular Obligations to the Rev'd Mr. <HI>Samp&s;on Harris,</HI> Mini&s;ter of <HI>Stone Hou&s;e,</HI> in <HI>Glou|ce&s;ter-&s;hire,</HI> I went down thither, at his Re|que&s;t, to &s;upply his Place, whil&s;t he came up to di&s;patch &s;ome Affairs in Town.</P>
<P>Hither I had rea&s;on to think God &s;ent me in An&s;wer to Prayer: For there was a little &s;weet Society of &s;eeking Souls, who had heard me preach at an adjacent Town, and wre&s;tled with God, if it was his Will, to &s;end me a|mong&s;t them. They received me with all Joy, and mo&s;t of the Pari&s;hioners were very civil when I came to vi&s;it them from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e. Upon Examination I found them
<PB N="23" REF="005886_0022_10275D152E516C00">
more knowing than I expected. Their Pa&s;tor had u&s;ed to catechi&s;e the little ones in the Summer Sea&s;on, and expound the four Le&s;&s;ons every Lord's Day in the Church. I followed his&punc; good Example, and found great Freedom and A&s;&s;i&s;tance given me both in my publick and private Admini&s;trations. Having the U&s;e of the Par&s;onage Hou&s;e, I expounded every Night. Many that were not Pari&s;hioners came to hear, and were edified. On <HI>Sundays,</HI> be|&s;ides expounding the Le&s;&s;ons, catechi&s;ing and preaching, I repeated my Sermons to the Society. Neither Church or Hou&s;e could contain the People that came. I found uncommon Manife&s;tations granted me from above. Early in the Morning, at Noon Day, Evening, and Midnight, nay all the Day long, did the Ble&s;&s;ed JESUS vi&s;it and refre&s;h my Heart. Could the Trees of a certain Wood, near <HI>Stone-Hou&s;e,</HI> &s;peak, they would tell what &s;weet Commu|nion I and &s;ome more dear Souls enjoyed with the ever Ble&s;&s;ed God there. Some|times as I have been walking, my Soul would make &s;uch Sallies as tho' it would go out of the Body. At other Times I would be &s;o overpowered with a Sen&s;e of

God's infinite Maje&s;ty, that I would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e con&s;trained to throw my&s;elf pro&s;trate on the Ground, and offer my Soul as a Blank in his Hands, to write on it what he plea&s;|ed. One Night was a Time never to be forgotten. It happened to lighten exceed|ingly. I had been expounding to many People, and &s;ome being afraid to go home, I thought it my Duty to accompany them, and improve the Occa&s;ion, to &s;tir them up to prepare for the coming of the Son of Man. But O what did my Soul feel! In my return to the Par&s;onage Hou&s;e, whil&s;t others were ri&s;ing from their Beds and frightned almo&s;t to Death, to &s;ee the Light|ning run upon the Ground, and &s;hine from one Part of the Heaven unto the other, I and another, a poor, but pious, Country|man, were in the field, praying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, prai&s;|ing of, and exulting in our God, and long|ing for that Time when JESUS &s;hould be revealed from Heaven in a Flame of Fire!

on <HI>A&s;cen&s;ion</HI> Day, when I took my Leave, the Concern they &s;hewed at my Depar|ture was inexpre&s;&s;ible. Their Sighs and Tears almo&s;t broke my Heart. Many cried out with <HI>Ruth, Whither thou goe&s;t I will go, where thou lodge&s;t I will lodge.</HI> But I only took one with me who proved a good Servant, and is, I believe, a true Follower of the ever Ble&s;&s;ed JESUS.</P>
<P>The Incumbent being returned from <HI>London,</HI> and the People of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> having given me repeated Invitations, nay having in&s;i&s;ted upon my coming again, &s;ince the Time of my embarking was deferred, On <HI>May</HI> 23d.

Multitudes came on Foot, and many in Coaches a Mile without the City to meet me&punc; and almo&s;t all &s;aluted and ble&s;&s;ed me as I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> along the Street. Upon my coming here I received Letters from <HI>Lon|don</HI> informing me, that Mr. <HI>Oglethorp</HI> would not embark the&s;e two Months. This gladen'd many Hearts, tho' I cannot &s;ay it did mine; becau&s;e I counted the Hours, as it were, till I went abroad. I preached as u&s;ual about five Times a Week; but the Congregations grew, if po&s;&s;ible, larger and larger. It was wonderful to
<PB N="26" REF="005886_0025_10275E0423366F50">
&s;ee how the People hung upon the Rails of the Organ-Loft, climb'd upon the Le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ds of the Church, and made the Church it&s;elf &s;o hot with their Breath, that the Steam would fall from the Pillars like Drops of Rain. Sometimes almo&s;t as many would go away for want of Room as came in, and it was with great Difficulty I got into the De&s;k to read Prayers, or preach. Per|&s;ons of all Denominations flocked to hear. Per&s;ons of all Ranks, not only publickly attended my Mini&s;try, but gave me private Invitations to their Hou&s;es. A private So|ciety or two were erected. I preached and collected for the poor Pri&s;oners in <HI>New-gate</HI> twice or thrice a Week, and many made me large offers if I would not go abroad.</P>
<P>During my &s;tay here I paid another Vi|&s;it to <HI>Bath,</HI> and preach'd three Times in the <HI>Abbey-Church,</HI> and once in <HI>Queen'</HI>s <HI>Chap|pel.</HI> People crowded and were affected as at <HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI> And God &s;tirred up &s;ome elect Ladies to give upwards of a <HI>Hundred and Sixty Pounds</HI> for the Poor of <HI>Georgia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 21<HI>&s;t</HI> I took my la&s;t Farewell at <HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI> But when I came to tell them, It might be, that they would <HI>&s;ee my Face no more,</HI> high and low, young and old

bur&s;t into &s;uch a Flood of Tears as I had never &s;een before; Drops fell from their Eyes like Rain, or rather gu&s;hed out like Water out of the Stony Rock. Multi|tudes after Sermon followed me home weep|ing; and the next Day I was empoyled from Seven in the Morning till Midnight in talk|ing and giving &s;piritual Advice to awakned Souls.</P>
<P>About three the next Morning, having thrown my&s;elf on the Bed for an Hour or two, I &s;et out for <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> becau&s;e I heard that a great Company on Hor&s;eback and in Coaches intended to &s;ee me out of Town. Some finding them&s;elves di&s;ap|pointed, followed me thither, where I &s;taid a few Days and preached to a very crowded Auditory. Then I went on to <HI>Oxford,</HI> where we had, as it were, a general Rendez|vouz of the <HI>Methodi&s;ts;</HI> and, finding their Intere&s;t flouri&s;hing, and being impatient to go abroad, I ha&s;tened away, after taking a mo&s;t affectionate Leave, and came to <HI>Lon|don</HI> about the End of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> I hope, in &s;ome Degree, thankful for the great Things the Lord had done for me in the Country.</P>
<P>Every Hour now &s;eem'd a Week, and every Week a Year till I was embarked.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="005886_0027_10275E08C4E05A20">
I knew there was no Mini&s;ter at <HI>Frederica,</HI> for which Place I was then appointed, and I did not care to be ab&s;ent longer from my proper Charge. Mr. <HI>Oglethorp'</HI>s going was &s;till retarded, and I had thought it my Duty to go immediately without him, had not he and my other Friends urged, that the Soldiers would &s;hortly embark, and that I had be&s;t go over with them. This &s;ome|what pacified me, and having now taken a final farewel of all Friends in the Coun|try, I was re&s;olved to abide at <HI>London,</HI> and give my&s;elf wholly to Prayer, the Study of the Scriptures, and my own Heart, till the Soldiers &s;hould embark.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e I lodged at, was good old Mr. <HI>Hutton'</HI>s in <HI>College-&s;treet, We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> where I had the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing my Dear Friend Mr. <HI>Ingham,</HI> lately returned from <HI>Georgia;</HI> and perceiving him, as I thought, remarkably grown in Grace. I long'd &s;till more to be &s;ent to the &s;ame School, hop|ing to catch &s;ome of that Holy Flame with which his Soul was fired. We freely and &s;olemnly conver&s;ed together about my Call abroad. It &s;eem'd to both quite clear, though we could have wi&s;h'd, had it been the Divine Will, to have

lived and died together. Our Hearts were knit to each other, like the Hearts of <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Jonathan.</HI> At midnight we would ri&s;e to &s;ing Prai&s;es to God, and in|tercede for the whole State of CHRIST'S Church militant here on Earth.</P>
<P>With this my Dear Friend, I one Day paid a Vi&s;it to a worthy Doctor of Di|vinity near <HI>London,</HI> who introduced us to &s;ome Honourable Ladies, who, as I had heard, delighted in doing good. It being my con&s;tant Practice to improve my Ac|quaintance with the Rich for the Benefit of the Poor, I recommended two poor Clergy|men, and another pious Per&s;on to their Cha|rity. They &s;aid little, but between them, unknown to each other, they gave, I think, <HI>Thirty Six Guineas.</HI> When we came to the Doctor's Hou&s;e and &s;aw the Ladies Libe|rality, he &s;aid, <Q>If you had not &s;poke for others, you would have had a good deal of that your&s;elf.</Q> God gave me to rejoice that I had nothing, and the Poor all. The next Day, upon my return to <HI>Lon|don,</HI> in the fir&s;t Letter that I opened, was a Bank-note of Ten Pounds, &s;ent from an unexpected hand as a pre&s;ent for my&s;elf. This I took as a Hint from Providence to

go on doing good to others, with a full A&s;|&s;urance that the Lord would not let me want. Ble&s;&s;ed be his Name I have had many &s;uch In&s;tances of his tender Concern for my temporal, as well as my eternal Wellfare.</P>
<P>About this Time, thro' the Importuity of Friends, and A&s;per&s;ions of Enemies, I was prevailed upon to print my Sermon <HI>On the Nature and Nece&s;&s;ity of our Regene|ration or New-Birth in CHRIST JESUS,</HI> which under God began the awakening at <HI>London, Bri&s;tol, Glouce&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Glouce&s;ter|&s;hire.</HI> The Di&s;&s;enters I found were &s;ur|prized to &s;ee a Sermon on &s;uch a Subject from a Clergyman of the Church of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and finding the Author came from <HI>Oxford,</HI> were ready to &s;ay, (how ju&s;tly I will not determine) <Q><HI>Can any good come out of</HI> Nazareth?</Q> This Sermon &s;old well to Per&s;ons of all Denominations, and was di&s;per&s;ed very much in many Parts both at Home and Abroad. A &s;econd Im|pre&s;&s;ion was &s;oon called for; and finding another of my Sermons was printed without my leave, and in a very incorrect Manner, at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> I was obliged to publi&s;h in my own Defence, and afterwards thought I

<P>But to return to my publick Admini|&s;trations.

Employ. Once we &s;pent a whole Night in Prayer and Prai&s;e; and many a Time, at Midnight and at one in the Morning, after I have been wearied almo&s;t to Death in Preaching, Writing, and Conver&s;ation, and going from Place to Place, God imparted new Life to my Soul, and would enable me to intercede with him for an Hour and a Half and two Hours together.&mdash;The Sweetne&s;s of this Exerci&s;e made me com|po&s;e my Sermon upon <HI>Interce&s;&s;ion;</HI> and I cannot think it Pre&s;umption to give it as my Opinion, that partly, at lea&s;t, in An&s;wer to Prayers, then put up by his dear Children, the Word for &s;ome Years pa&s;t, has ran and been glorified, not only in <HI>England</HI> but in many other Parts of the World.</P>

<SALUTE>My very Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT being now &s;ome Months &s;ince I ar|rived here, I think it high time, ac|cording to my Promi&s;e, to &s;end you as explicite an Account a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> I well can, of the <HI>Ri&s;e, Progre&s;s</HI> and <HI>Pre&s;ent Situation</HI> of the <HI>Orphan-Hou&s;e,</HI> where I now am.&mdash;Some have thought that the erecting &s;uch a Building was only the Produce of my own Brain: But they are much mi&s;taken. For it was fir&s;t propo&s;ed to me by my dear Friend the Rev'd Mr. <HI>Charles We&s;ley,</HI> who with his Excellency General <HI>Oglethorp,</HI> had concerted a Scheme for carrying on &s;uch a
<PB N="52" REF="005886_0048_10275E375EBB2830">
De&s;ign before I had any Thoughts of going abroad my&s;elf. It was natural to think, that as the Government intended this Province for the Refuge and Support of many of our poor Countrymen, that Numbers of &s;uch Adventurers mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be taken off, by being expo&s;ed to the Hard&s;hips which unavoidably attend a new Settlement. I thought it therefore a noble De&s;ign in the General to erect a Hou&s;e for fatherle&s;s Chil|dren. And believing &s;uch a Provi&s;ion for Orphans would be &s;ome Inducement with many to come over, I fell in with the De|&s;ign, when mention'd to me by my Friend, and was re&s;olved, in they Strength of God, to pro&s;ecute it with all my might.&mdash;This was mention'd to the Honourable the Tru&s;tees. They took it kindly at my Hands; and as I then began to be pretty popular at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and el&s;e where, they wro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e to the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> of <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Wells,</HI> for leave for me to preach a Charity Sermon on this Occa&s;ion in the <HI>Abby Church.</HI> This was granted, and I accordingly began im|mediately to compo&s;e a &s;uitable Di&s;cour&s;e. But knowing my fir&s;t &s;tay at <HI>Georgia</HI> would nece&s;&s;arily be &s;hort, on account of my re|turning again to take Prie&s;t's Orders, I
<PB N="53" REF="005886_0049_10275E3BAA4F11E8">
thought it mo&s;t prudent fir&s;t to go and &s;ee for my &s;elf, and defer pro&s;ecuting the Scheme till I came home; becau&s;e I could then be better able to judge, whether the Scheme was practicable, and con&s;equently could be able to recommend it with the greater Earne&s;tne&s;s.&mdash;When I came to <HI>Geor|gia</HI> I found many poor Orphans, who, tho' taken Notice of by the Honourable Tru&s;tees, yet thro' the Neglect of Per&s;ons that acted under them, were in mi&s;erable Circum|&s;tances.&mdash;For want of a Hou&s;e to breed them up in, the poor little Ones were tabled out here and there, and be&s;ides the Hurt they received by bad Examples, forgot at home what they learnt at School.&mdash;Others were at hard Services, and likely to have no Education at all.&mdash;Upon &s;eeing this, and finding that his Maje&s;ty and Parliament had the Intere&s;t of this Colony much at Heart, I thought I could not better &s;hew my regard to God and my Country, than by getting a Hou&s;e and Land for the&s;e Chil|dren, where they might learn to labour, read and write, and at the &s;ame Time be brought up in the Nurture and Admoniti|on of the Lord.&mdash;Accordingly at my re|turn to <HI>England,</HI> in the Year 1738, to take
<PB N="54" REF="005886_0050_10275E3E93B7DDE8">
Prie&s;ts Orders, I applied to the Honoura|ble Society for a grant of 500 Acres of Land, and laid my&s;elf under an Obligation to build a Hou&s;e upon it, and to receive from Time to Time as many Orphans as the Land and Stock would maintain. As I had always acted like a Clergyman of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> having preached in a good Part of the <HI>London</HI> Churches, and but a few Months before collected near a Thou&s;and Pounds Sterling, for the Children belonging to the Charity Schools in <HI>London</HI> and <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter;</HI> it was natural to think, that I might now have the U&s;e at lea&s;t of &s;ome of the&s;e Churches to preach in for the Orphans hereafter more immediately to be committed to my Care.&mdash;But by that time I had taken Prie&s;ts Orders, the Spirit of the Clergy began to be much imbittered.&mdash;Churches were gradually denied me&mdash;And I mu&s;t let this good De&s;ign drop, and Thou&s;ands (I might add ten Thou&s;ands) go without hearing the Word of God, or preach in the Fields.&mdash;Indeed two Churches one in <HI>London, viz. Spittle-fields,</HI> and one in <HI>Bri&s;tol, viz.</HI> St. <HI>Philips</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> were lent me upon this Occa&s;ion; but tho&s;e were all.&mdash;However, God kept me from being
<PB N="55" REF="005886_0051_10275E401C3EB680">
di&s;couraged.&mdash;I collected for the Orphan-Hou&s;e in <HI>Moor-fields,</HI> Two and Fifty Pounds one Sabbath Day Morning; Twenty Two Pounds of which was in Copper. It would have rejoiced your Heart to &s;ee the People give.&mdash;They offered willingly, and took more pains to come through the crowd and put their Contributions into my Hatt, than &s;ome would to have got them.&mdash;Thou&s;ands of Prayers were put up with the Alms that were given, and I tru&s;t both went up as a Memorial before God. In the After|noon I collected again at <HI>Kennington Com|mon,</HI> and continued to do &s;o at mo&s;t of the Places where I preached. Be&s;ides this, two or three of the <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> and &s;everal Per&s;ons of Di&s;tinction contributed, till at length, having gotten about a Thou&s;and and ten Pounds, I gave over collecting, and went with what I had to <HI>Georgia.</HI> At that time multitudes offered to accompany me; but I cho&s;e to take over only a Surgeon and a few more of both Sexes, that I thought would be u&s;eful in carrying on my De&s;ign. The&s;e chearfully embarked with me, de&s;ir|ing nothing for their Pains, but Food and Raiment, My Dear Fellow-Traveller, <HI>Wil|liam Seward,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q;</ABBR> al&s;o joined with them,
<PB N="56" REF="005886_0052_10275E4300398690">
and was particularly u&s;eful to me on this Occa&s;ion. Our fir&s;t Voyage was to <HI>Phila|delphia,</HI> where I was w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ing to go for the &s;ake of laying in Provi&s;ion. Having a Cap|tain of a Ship with me, who had been my &s;piritual Child, by his Advice, I laid out in <HI>London</HI> a good Part of the Thou&s;and Pounds for Goods; and by his Care and my other Fellow-Travellers, without any trou|ble to my&s;elf, got as much by them at <HI>Phi|ladelphia</HI> as nearly defrayed the Family's Expence of coming over. Here God ble&s;&s;|ed my Mini&s;try daily, and begun that Work in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> which, I am per&s;uaded, will be remembred thro' the Endle&s;s Ages of Eternity. <HI>January</HI> following 1739 I met my Family at <HI>Georgia,</HI> and being unwilling to lo&s;e any time, I hired a large Hou&s;e, and took in all the Orphans I could find in the Colony, A great many al&s;o of the Town's Children came to School gratis, and many poor People that could not maintain their Children, upon Application, had leave given them to &s;end their little ones for a Month or two, or more, as they could &s;pare them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> at length my Family con&s;i&s;ted of between 60 and 70. Mo&s;t of the Orphans were in poor Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, and three or four almo&s;t
<PB N="57" REF="005886_0053_10275E44E96C2FE0">
eat up with Lice&mdash;I likewi&s;e erected an <HI>In|firmary,</HI> in which many &s;ick People were cured and taken care of Gratis. I have now by me a Li&s;t of upwards of a Hundred and Thirty Patients, which were under the Surgeon's Hands, exclu&s;ive of my own private Family. This Surgeon I furni&s;hed with all proper Druggs and Uten&s;ils, which put me to no &s;mall Expence: And this was &s;till increa&s;ed by clearing Land, buying Stock, and building a large Dwelling Hou&s;e Sixty by Forty, and Out Hou&s;es, commo|dious for a large Family to live in. Some|times (Labourers and all) I have had a Hundred and Twenty to provide for daily&punc; My Friends as well as my&s;elf, &s;eem'd to have particular Courage and Faith given us for the Sea&s;on; and we went on chearfully, believing that he for who&s;e &s;ake we began, would enable us to fini&s;h this good Work. About <HI>March</HI> I began the great Hou&s;e, hav|ing only about One Hundred and Fifty Pounds in Ca&s;h. I called it <HI>Bethe&s;da,</HI> be|cau&s;e I hoped it would be a Hou&s;e of Mercy to many Souls. Ble&s;&s;ed be God we have not been di&s;appointed of our Hope. It has proved a Hou&s;e of Mercy indeed to many.
<PB N="58" REF="005886_0054_10275E4BCFE03580">
Several of our Labourers, as well as Vi&s;itors, have (in a Judgment of Charity) been born of God here, and given evident Proofs of it, by bringing forth the Fruits of the Spirit. Many Boys have been put out to Trades, and many Girls put out to Service. I had the Plea&s;ure the other Day of &s;eeing three Boys work at the Hou&s;e in which they were bred, one of them out of his Time a Jour|neyman, and the others &s;erving under their Ma&s;ters. One that I brought from <HI>New-England</HI> is hand&s;omely &s;ettled in <HI>Carolina;</HI> and another from <HI>Philadelphia</HI> is married and lives very comfortably at <HI>Savannah.</HI> How &s;o large a Family has been &s;upported in &s;uch a Colony, without any vi&s;ible Fund, is wonderful! I am &s;urprized when I look back, and &s;ee how for the&s;e &s;ix Years la&s;t pa&s;t, God has &s;pread a Table in the Wil|derne&s;s for &s;o many Per&s;ons. Were all the particular Providences that have attended this Work recorded, perhaps they would be found not inferior to tho&s;e mentioned by Profe&s;&s;or <HI>Frank,</HI> in his <HI>Pietas Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">len&s;is,</HI> who&s;e Memory is very precious to me, and who&s;e Example has a Thou&s;and Times been ble&s;&s;ed to &s;trengthen and encourage me in the carrying on this Enterprize.

Hereafter perhaps when I have more Lei|&s;ure, I may give you an Account of &s;ome of them&mdash;My being detained &s;o long in <HI>England</HI> has been a little detrimental to me, my Friends not knowing &s;o well how to act, becau&s;e they expected to &s;ee me daily. And I cannot yet &s;ay that I have &s;urmount|ed the fir&s;t Years Expence, which indeed was very great, and greater no doubt than it would be now, after my Friends have had &s;o many Years Experience in the Co|lony.&mdash;However I doubt not but by the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, in a &s;hort Time to pay off my Arrears, and then the Family will be maintained at a &s;mall Expence.&mdash;My &s;tand|ing Annual Charges, are now but trifling to what they have been; and my Friends have rai&s;ed an annual Sub&s;cription &s;ufficient for di&s;charging it till the Family may be a|ble to provide for it&s;elf.&mdash;This, God willing, I hope will be, in a good Mea&s;ure, &s;peedi|ly effected. We have lately begun to u&s;e the Plow; and next Year I hope to have many Acres of good Oats and Barley. We have near twenty Sheep and Lambs, Fifty Head of Cattle, and Seven Hor&s;es. We hope to kill a Thou&s;and Weight of Pork this Sea&s;on. Our Garden which is
<PB N="60" REF="005886_0056_10275E4F176FE890">
very beautiful, furni&s;hes us with all Sorts of Greens, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> We have plenty of Milk, Eggs, Poultry, and make a good deal of Butter weekly. A good Quantity of Wool and Cotton has been given me, and we hope to have &s;ufficient &s;pun and wove for the next Winter's Cloathing.&mdash;If the Vines hit, we may expect two or three Hog&s;heads of Wine out of the Vineyard. The Fa|mily now con&s;i&s;ts of Twenty Six Per&s;ons. Two of the Orphan Boys are blind, one is little better than an Idiot.&mdash;But notwith|&s;tanding they are u&s;eful in the Family, the one in the Field and the other in the Kitchen. I have two Women to take Care of the Hou&s;hold Work, and three Men and two Boys employed about the Plantation and Cattle. A &s;et of Dutch Servants has been lately &s;ent over: The Magi&s;trates were plea&s;ed to give me two; and I took in a poor old Widow, aged near 70, whom no body el&s;e cared to have. A valuable young Man from <HI>New-England</HI> is my School-Ma&s;ter, and in my Ab&s;ence performs Duty in the Family. On Sabbaths the grown People attend on publick Wor&s;hip at <HI>Sa|vannah,</HI> or at <HI>White-bluff,</HI> a Village near <HI>Bethe&s;da,</HI> where a Dutch Mini&s;ter offici|ates
<PB N="61" REF="005886_0057_10275E50AB9E0018">
My dear Friends who have hitherto been my A&s;&s;i&s;tants, being married and hav|ing each one or two Children, thought it be&s;t, as mo&s;t &s;uitable to the In&s;titution, to remove. God has mercifully provided for them, and they are comfortably &s;ettled, &s;ome at <HI>Savannah</HI> and &s;ome el&s;ewhere. We frequently write to and hear from one another. I need not trouble you with the Order of our Family. It is pretty near the &s;ame as u&s;ual, and I do not think to make any material Alteration for &s;ome time. Ma|ny have applied to me to take in their Children as Boarders, and erect a publick School: But I have not yet determined. It is certain &s;uch a School would be exceed|ing u&s;eful in this part of the World, if there &s;hould be a Peace, not only for tho&s;e nor|thern Parts of the Colony, but al&s;o for the more Southern Parts of <HI>Carolina, Puris|burgh,</HI> and <HI>Frederica,</HI> where are many fine Youths. I have been prevailed on to take one from <HI>Frederica,</HI> and another from <HI>Pu|ri&s;burgh,</HI> and it may be &s;hall admit more. For the pre&s;ent, con&s;idering the Situation of Affairs, I think it mo&s;t prudent to go on in making what Improvements I can on the Plantation and bring a Tutor with me
<PB N="62" REF="005886_0058_10275E564864B650">
from the Northward in the Fall, to teach a few Youths the Languages, and enlarge the Family when Affairs are more &s;ettled. The Hou&s;e is a noble commodious Building, and every Thing &s;weetly adapted for bring|ing up Youth. Here is Land to employ them in to exerci&s;e their Bodies, and keep them from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ene&s;s out of School Hours. Here are none of the Temptations to de|bauch their tender Minds, which are com|mon to more populous Countries, or in Pla|ces where Children mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be brought up with Negroes. What God intends to do with the Colony is not for me to enquire: Secret Things belong to him. It has hitherto been wonderfully pre&s;erved, and the Orphan-Hou&s;e, like the burning Bu&s;h, has flouri&s;hed uncon&s;umed. In fine, the Government has, no doubt, its Well|fare much at Heart: And, God willing, I intend to carry on my De&s;ign till I &s;ee the Colony &s;ink or &s;wim. The Money that has been expended on the <HI>Orphan|Hou&s;e,</HI> and Orphan-Hou&s;e Family, has been of va&s;t Service to this Northern Part of the Colony. And tho' it has been greatly de|trimental to my own private Intere&s;t, yet I do not repent of the Undertaking&punc; No, I
<PB N="64" REF="005886_0059_10275E592BBA0010">
rejoice in it daily, and hope yet to &s;ee many more Souls born unto God here. I have had a very comfortable Winter. The Peo|ple of <HI>Savannah,</HI> having no Mini&s;ter till lately, gladly accepted my Labours; and at <HI>Frederica,</HI> the Gentlemen and Soldiers of General <HI>Oglethorp'</HI>s Regiment, as well as the Inhabitants of the Town, received me very gladly. Major <HI>Horton</HI> &s;eems to be|have very well. He has a very fine grow|ing Plantation&mdash;I &s;aw Barley in the Ear the fir&s;t of <HI>March. Georgia</HI> is very healthy&mdash;Not above one, and that a little Child, has died out of our Family, &s;ince it remov|ed to <HI>Bethe&s;da.</HI> I think the Colony (were the Inhabitants &s;ufficiently numerous) is as capable of as good Improvement as any on the Continent.</P>
<P>For the Satisfaction of my Friends, and &s;ilencing, if po&s;&s;ible, my Enemies, I have had my Accounts from the very Beginning to <HI>January</HI> la&s;t, publickly audited and exa|mined, Debittor and Creditor, Article by Article; and an Oath for Confirmation, being an End of all Strife, I have &s;worn to them.
