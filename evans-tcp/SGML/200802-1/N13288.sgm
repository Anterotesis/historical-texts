<P>ALMIGHTY God who governs the world generally carries on the de&s;igns of his government by the in&s;trumen|tality of &s;ubordinate agents; hereby giving &s;cope and opportunity to his creatures to become his mini&s;ters for good to one another, in the exerci&s;e of the various powers and ca|pacities with which he has endowed them. Tho' for the vindication of his honor, to di&s;pel the darkne&s;s and give a check to the idolatry and vice which over&s;pread the world, and in order to prepare mankind for the reception of a Savi|our to be manife&s;ted in due time, God was plea&s;ed to take the Jewi&s;h nation under his par|ticular care and protection, and to become their
<PB N="6" REF="016800_0005_0F9E79CD014374B0">
political law-giver and head; yet he made u&s;e of the agency of &s;ome of that people in the ad|mini&s;tration of his government. The legi&s;lative power he &s;eems to have re&s;erved wholly to him|&s;elf; there being no evidence that any of the rulers or a&s;&s;emblies of the people had authority to make laws. But the judicial and executive powers were intru&s;ted with men. At the fir&s;t in&s;titution of the government, Mo&s;es &s;eems to have exerci&s;ed the judicial authority wholly by him&s;elf. In this bu&s;ine&s;s he was employed from morning till evening, when Jethro, his father in law, the prie&s;t and prince of Midian came to vi&s;it him. This wi&s;e man, for &s;uch he &s;urely was, ob&s;erved to Mo&s;es, that this bu&s;ine&s;s was too heavy for him, and what he was not able to per|form alone; and therefore advi&s;ed him to appoint proper per&s;ons to bear the burthen with him, provided it was agreeable to the divine will. Mo&s;es it is &s;aid, in the context, hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had &s;aid. There can be no doubt but that God approved this mea&s;ure, tho' it was fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted by a pagan, otherwi&s;e it would not have been adopted. It &s;eems indeed to have been highly expedient, and even nece&s;&s;ary. From whence it appears, that even in this government which was &s;o immediately the work of God, room was left for men to make &s;uch appointments and in&s;titu|tions, as by experience &s;hould be found nece&s;&s;ary for the due admini&s;tration of it. The general
<PB N="7" REF="016800_0006_0F9E79CDE5FAF620">
plan was laid by God, and he was the &s;ole legi&s;la|tor. This was nece&s;&s;ary in that age of darkne&s;s, idolatry and vice. Mankind &s;eem to have been too ignorant and corrupt to form a con&s;titution, and a code of laws, in any good mea&s;ure adapted to promote their piety, virtue and happine&s;s. But God left many &s;maller matters to be regu|lated by the wi&s;dom and di&s;cretion of the people. This is agreeable to a general rule of the divine conduct; which is not to accompli&s;h that, in a &s;upernatural or miraculous way, which may be done by the exertion of human powers.</P>
<P>IT is &s;aid, in the context, that in compliance with the advice of Jethro, Mo&s;es cho&s;e able men&mdash;and made them rulers. But it is gene|rally &s;uppo&s;ed that they were cho&s;en by the peo|ple. This is a&s;&s;erted by Jo&s;ephus, and plainly intimated by Mo&s;es in his recapitulary di&s;cour&s;e recorded in 1 chap. of Deut. where he &s;ays to the people, "I &s;pake unto you, &s;aying I am not able to bear you my&s;elf alone&mdash;<HI>take ye</HI> wi&s;e men, and under&s;tanding and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you". So that the&s;e officers were without doubt elected by the people, tho' introduced by Mo&s;es into their office. And indeed the Jews always exerci&s;ed this right of choo&s;ing their own rulers; even Saul and David and all their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in the throne, were made kings by the voice of the people. (&s;ee 1 Sam. 11, 15. 2 Sam. 2, 4, 5, 3.) This natural and important right, God never de|prived them of, tho' they had &s;hewn &s;o much
<PB N="8" REF="016800_0007_0F9E79CEA59C9210">
folly and perver&s;ene&s;s, in rejecting him, and de|&s;iring to have a king like the nations around them.</P>
<P>THE bu&s;ine&s;s for which Jethro advi&s;ed, that the&s;e rulers &s;hould be cho&s;en was to decide the &s;maller and le&s;s difficult matters of controver&s;y that aro&s;e among the people; while cau&s;es of greater con&s;equence were to be brought before Mo&s;es: So that they were a &s;ort of inferior ju|dicial officers, or judges of inferior courts. Tho' they were not officers of the highe&s;t dignity and authority in the &s;tate, yet the midianiti&s;h &s;age advi&s;ed, that they &s;hould be "able men, &s;uch as fear God, men of truth hating coveteou&s;ne&s;s; judging that &s;uch men only were fit for the office. He has here in a few words pointed out to us what &s;ort of men are proper to be put in autho|rity, whether in an higher or lower &s;tation; for if &s;uch qualifications are nece&s;&s;ary for this infe|rior office, they mu&s;t &s;urely be more &s;o, for the higher and &s;upreme offices in government. And the con&s;ideration of the&s;e qualifications, is what I principally intend in the following di&s;cour&s;e: But before I enter upon this, I would give a little attention to two or three other points. Accordingly I &s;hall con&s;ider,

<P>The&s;e particulars being fini&s;hed in a few words, I &s;hall then,
<LIST>
<ITEM>IV. PARTICULARLY con&s;ider the qualifica|tions pointed out in the text, as nece&s;&s;ary for civil rulers.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>After which, the &s;ubject will be applied to the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I. LET us con&s;ider the nece&s;&s;ity of civil go|vernment for the happine&s;s of mankind. Men have in all ages and nations been induced by a &s;en&s;e of their wants and weakne&s;&s;es, as well as by their love of &s;ociety, to keep up &s;ome inter|cour&s;e with one another. A man totally &s;epa|rated from his &s;pecies, would be le&s;s able to provide for him&s;elf than almo&s;t any other crea|ture. Some &s;ort of &s;ociety, &s;ome intercour&s;e with other men in nece&s;&s;ary to his happine&s;s, if not to his very exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE then a number of men living near together, and maintaining that intercour&s;e which is nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upply of their wants, but without any laws or government e&s;tabli&s;hed a|mong them by mutual con&s;ent; or in what is called a &s;tate of nature. In this &s;tate every one has an equal right to liberty, and to do what he thinks proper. The love of liberty is natural to all: It appears the fir&s;t, opperates the mo&s;t
<PB N="10" REF="016800_0009_0F9E79D07164AB28">
forceably and is extingui&s;hed the la&s;t of any of our pa&s;&s;ions. And this principle would lead every man to pur&s;ue and enjoy every thing, to which he had an inclination. Several per&s;ons would no doubt de&s;ire and pur&s;ue the &s;ame thing, which only one could enjoy. Hence conte&s;ts would ari&s;e; and, no one el&s;e having a right to interfere, they mu&s;t be &s;ettled by the parties: But prejudice and &s;elf-love would render them partial judges, and probably prevent an amicable &s;ettlement; &s;o that the di&s;pute mu&s;t at la&s;t be ended by the &s;tronge&s;t arm; and thus the liber|ty of the weak would be de&s;troyed by the pow|er of the &s;trong. Every un&s;ucce&s;sful compete|tor would think him&s;elf injured by another's &s;eizing that to which, in his own opinion, he had an equal right, and would endeavour to obtain compen&s;ation: This would provoke re|taliation, and naturally lead on to an endle&s;s reciprocation of injuries. The injured who found him&s;elf unable to contend with his ad|ver&s;ary, would call in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome more powerful combatant, to avenge his cau&s;e: The ag|gre&s;&s;or too would endeavor to &s;trengthen him&s;elf for defence by a&s;&s;ociates; and thus parties would be formed for rapine, deva&s;tation, and murder; and the peaceful &s;tate of nature &s;oon be exchang|ed for a number of little contending tyrannies, or for one &s;ucce&s;sful one, that &s;hould &s;wallow up all the re&s;t. This would generally be the ca&s;e where men &s;hould attempt to live without laws or government; nor can they any way &s;ecure them&s;elves again&s;t all manner of violence and
<PB N="11" REF="016800_0010_0F9E79D11A96F608">
injuries from bad men, but by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> together in &s;ociety, agreeing upon &s;ome univer&s;al rules to be ob&s;erved by all;&mdash;that controver&s;ies &s;hall be determined, not by the parties concerned, but by di&s;intere&s;ted judges, and according to e&s;tabli&s;hed rules; that their determinations &s;hall be enforced by the joint power of the whole community either in puni&s;hing the injurious or protecting the innocent. Man is not to be tru&s;t|ed with his unbounded love of liberty&punc; unle&s;s it is under &s;ome other re&s;traint, than what ari&s;es from his own rea&s;on or the law of God. The&s;e, in many in&s;tances, would make but a feeble re|&s;i&s;tance to his&punc; lu&s;t or avarice; and he would pur&s;ue his liberty to the de&s;truction of his fellow creatures&punc; if he was not re&s;trained by human laws and puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Let us next con&s;ider,</P>
<P>II. THE right of the people to choo&s;e their own rulers.</P>
<P>No man is born a magi&s;trate, or with a right to rule over his brethren. If this were the ca&s;e, there mu&s;t be &s;ome natural mark by which it might be known to whom this right belongs, or it could an&s;wer no end: But no man was ever known to come into the world with any &s;uch mark of &s;uperiority and domini|on. If a man by the improvement of his rea|&s;on and moral powers becomes more wi&s;e and virtuous than his brethren, this renders him
<PB N="12" REF="016800_0011_0F9E79D19FBA4C98">
better qualified for authority than others: But &s;till he is no magi&s;trate or lawgiver, till he is appointed &s;uch by the people.</P>
<P>NOR has one &s;tate or kingdom a right to ap|point rulers for another. This would infer &s;uch a natural inequality in mankind as is incon&s;i&s;tent with the equal freedom of all. One &s;tate may indeed by virtue of its &s;uperior power a&s;&s;ume this right; and the weaker &s;tate may&punc; be obliged to &s;ubmit to it, for want of power to re&s;i&s;t. But it is an unju&s;t encroachment upon their liberty, which they ought to get rid off as &s;oon as they can: It is a mark of tyranny on one &s;ide, and of inglorious &s;lavery on the other.</P>
<P>THE magi&s;trate is properly the tru&s;tee of the people: He can have no ju&s;t power but what he receives from them. To them he ought to be accountable for the u&s;e he makes of this power. But if a man may be inve&s;ted with the power of government, which is the united pow|er of the community, without their con&s;ent, how can they call him to account; what check can they have upon him; or what &s;ecurity for the enjoyment of any thing which he may &s;ee fit to deprive them of? They mu&s;t in this ca&s;e be &s;laves: But as every people have a right to be free, they mu&s;t have a right of choo&s;ing their own rulers and appointing &s;uch as they think mo&s;t proper; becau&s;e this right is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to liberty, that the moment a people are deprived of it, they cea&s;e to be free. This, as has been
<PB N="13" REF="016800_0012_0F9E79D3D516E918">
already ob&s;erved, is a right which the Jews al|ways enjoyed; they elected their kings, generals, judges and other officers; tho' in &s;ome few in|&s;tances God did expre&s;sly point out to them the per&s;on whom they ought to choo&s;e; which however, he has never done to any other people.</P>
<P>Let us now con&s;ider,</P>
<P>III. THE bu&s;ine&s;s of rulers in general.</P>
<P>AND this is, to promote and &s;ecure the hap|pine&s;s of the whole community. For this end only they are inve&s;ted with power, and only for this end it ought to be employed. The apo&s;tle tells us, that the magi&s;trate is God's mini&s;ter for good to the people. This is the &s;ole end for which God has ordained, that magi&s;trates &s;hould be appointed, that they may carry on his bene|volent purpo&s;es, in promoting the good and happine&s;s of human &s;ociety; and hence their power is &s;aid to be from God; that is, it is &s;o, while they employ it according to his will. But when they act again&s;t the good of &s;ociety, they cannot be &s;aid to act by authority from God, any more, than a &s;ervant can be &s;aid to act by his ma&s;ter's authority, while he acts directly contrary to his will. And no people, we may pre&s;ume, ever elected a magi&s;trate for any other end, than their own good; con&s;equently when a magi&s;trate acts again&s;t this end, he cannot act by authority from the people; &s;o that he acts, in this ca&s;e, without any authority either from
<PB N="14" REF="016800_0013_0F9E79D4C24BA580">
God or man. He cannot by any lawful autho|rity act again&s;t, but only for the good of &s;ociety. This in general is the bu&s;ine&s;s of civil rulers: But there are a variety of ways and means by which they are to carry on this bu&s;ine&s;s and accompli&s;h the important end of their in&s;tituti|on, which it is quite beyond my pre&s;ent de&s;ign particularly to point out, tho' there may be oc|ca&s;ion to &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome of them in the progre&s;s of my di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Let us now con&s;ider,</P>
<P>IV. THE qualifications pointed out in the text, as nece&s;&s;ary for rulers.</P>
<P N="1">1. They mu&s;t be <HI>able men.</HI> God has made a great difference in men in re&s;pect of their natural powers both of body and mind: To &s;ome he has given more, to others fewer talents. Nor is there perhaps a le&s;s difference in this re&s;pect, ari&s;ing from education. And tho' their are none but what may be good members of civil &s;ociety as well as faithful &s;ervants of God; yet every one has not abilities &s;ufficient to make him a good civil ruler. Woe unto thee, O land, when thy king is a child, &s;ays Solomon; hereby intimating that the happine&s;s of a people de|pends greatly upon the character of its rulers, and that if they r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">mble children in weakne&s;s, ignorance, credulity, ficklene&s;s, &amp;c. the peo|ple will of cour&s;e be very mi&s;erable. BY able men may be intended men of good under&s;tand|ing
<PB N="15" REF="016800_0014_0F9E79D58ACBB7B8">
and knowledge; men of clear heads, who have improved their minds by exerci&s;e, acquired an habit of rea&s;oning, and furni&s;hed them&s;elves with a good degree of knowledge: Men who have a ju&s;t conception of the nature and end of government in general, of the natural rights of mankind, of the nature and importance of civil and religions liberty; a knowledge of human nature; of the &s;prings of action and the readie&s;t way to engage and influence the heart; an ac|quaintance with the people to be governed, their genius, their prejudices, their intere&s;t with re&s;pect to other &s;tates, what difficulties they are under, what dangers they are liable to, and what they are able to bear and do. The&s;e things are ever to be taken into con&s;ideration by legi&s;lators, when they make laws for the internal police of a people, and in their tran&s;actions with, or re&s;pecting other &s;tates. It would be going too far to &s;ay, that an hone&s;t man cannot be a good ruler, unle&s;s he be of the fir&s;t character for good &s;en&s;e, learning and knowledge; but it will not be denied, that the more he excels in the&s;e things, the more likely he will be to rule well: He will be better able to &s;ee what mea&s;ures are &s;uited to the temper and genius of the people, and mo&s;t conducive to the end of his in&s;titution; how to rai&s;e nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies for the expences of government in ways mo&s;t ea&s;y and agreeable to the people; how to extricate them out of di|ficulties in which they may be involved; how to negotiate with foreign powers, how to pre|vent or mitigate the calamities of war, by com|promi&s;ing
<PB N="16" REF="016800_0015_0F9E79D630509378">
differences or putting the people into a condition to defend them&s;elves and repel in|juries: In a word, how to render them happy and re&s;pectable in peace, or formidable in war. The&s;e things require a very con&s;iderable degree of penetration and knowledge.</P>
<P>As it is of great importance to the commu|nity, that learning and knowledge be diffu&s;ed among the people in general, it is proper that the government &s;hould take all proper mea&s;ures for this purpo&s;e; making provi&s;ion for the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment and &s;upport of literary &s;chools and colleges: But ignorant and illiterate men will not be likely to be the patrons of learning; unacquainted with its excellency and import|ance, and &s;eeing no comline&s;s or beauty in it; they will reject and de&s;pi&s;e it, as the Jews did the great teacher of wi&s;dom who came from God. It would not be &s;trange if &s;uch men en|tru&s;ted with the government of a people &s;hould wholly neglect to make any provi&s;ion for the encouragement of literature. It is therefore proper that rulers &s;hould be men of under&s;tand|ing and learning, in order to their being di&s;po&s;ed to give due encouragement and &s;upport to the teachers and profe&s;&s;ors of the liberal arts and &s;ciences.</P>
<P>IT may be further ob&s;erved, that weak and illiterate men at the head of a government, will be likely to place, in inferior and &s;ubordinate offices, men of their own character, merely becau&s;e they know no better.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="016800_0016_0F9E79D706A1D0A0">
BUT by <HI>able men,</HI> may be intended men of courage, of firmne&s;s and re&s;olution of mind: Men that will not &s;ink into de&s;pondency at the &s;ight of difficulties, or de&s;ert their duty at the approach of danger; men that will hazard their lives in defence of the public, either again&s;t in|ternal &s;edition or external enemies, that will not fear the re&s;entment of turbulent, factious men; that will be a terror to evil doers, however pow|erful, and a protection to the innocent, however weak:&mdash;Men that will decide &s;ea&s;onably upon matters of importance and firmly abide by their deci&s;ion, not wavering with every wind that blows. There are &s;ome men that will halt be|tween two opinions and he&s;itate &s;o long, when any que&s;tion of con&s;equence is before them, and are &s;o ea&s;ily &s;haken from their purpo&s;e, when they have formed one, that they are on this ac|count very unfit to be intru&s;ted with public authority. Such double-minded men will be un&s;table in all their ways; their indeci&s;ion in council will produce none but feeble and in|effectual exertions. And this doubting and wa|vering in the &s;upreme authority mu&s;t be prejudi|cial to the &s;tate, and, at &s;ome critical times, may, be attended with fatal con&s;equences. Wi&s;e men will not indeed determine ra&s;hly, but when the ca&s;e requires it, they will re&s;olve &s;peedily, and act with vigor and &s;teadine&s;s.</P>
<P>BY <HI>able men</HI> may be further intended men ca|pable of enduring the burden and fatigue of go|vernment; men that have not broken or debili|tated
<PB N="18" REF="016800_0017_0F9E79D8696DF500">
their bodies or minds, by the effeminating plea&s;ures of luxury, intemperance or di&s;&s;ipa|tion. The &s;upreme government of a people is always a burden of great weight, tho' more diffi|cult at &s;ome times, than others. It cannot be managed well without great diligence and appli|cation. Weak and effeminate per&s;ons are there|fore by no means fit to manage it. But rulers &s;hould not only be able men, but</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Such as fear God.</HI> The fear of God, in the language of &s;cripture, does not intend a &s;lavi&s;h, &s;uper&s;titious dread, as of an almighty, ar|bitrary and cruel Being; but that ju&s;t reverence and awe of him, which naturally ari&s;es from a belief and habitual con&s;ideration of his glorious perfections and providence; of his being the moral governor of the world, a lover of holine&s;s and a hater of vice, who &s;ees every thought and de&s;ign, as well as every action of all his crea|tures, and will puni&s;h the impenitently vicious and reward the virtuous: It is therefore a feat of offending him productive of obedience to his laws, and ever accompanied with hope in his mercy and that filial love which is due to &s;o amiable a character.</P>
<P>IT is of great importance that civil rulers be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this principle. It mu&s;t be obvious to all, that a practical regard to the rules of &s;ocial virtue is nece&s;&s;ary to the character of a good magi&s;trate. Without this, a man is unworthy of any tru&s;t or confidence. But no principle
<PB N="19" REF="016800_0018_0F9E79D92299BA20">
&s;o effectually promotes and e&s;tabli&s;hes this regard to virtue, as the fear of God. A man may in|deed from a regard to the intrin&s;ic amiablene&s;s and excellency of virtue, from a mere &s;en&s;e of honor, from a love of fame, from a natural be|nevolence of temper, or from a prudent regard to his own temporal happine&s;s, follow virtue, when he is under no &s;trong temptation to the contrary. But &s;uppo&s;e him in a &s;ituation, where he apprehends that temporal infamy and mi&s;ery will be the certain con&s;equence of his practi&s;ing virtue, and temporal honor and happine&s;s the con&s;equence of his for&s;aking it, without any re|gard to God, as his ruler and judge, and can we expect that he will adhere to his duty? Will he &s;acrifice every thing dear in this life, in the cau&s;e of virtue, when he has no expectation of any reward for it, beyond the grave? Will he deny him&s;elf a pre&s;ent gratification, without any pro&s;|pect of being repaid either here or hereafter? Will he expo&s;e him&s;elf to reproach, poverty and death for the &s;ake of doing good to mankind, without any regard to God, as the rewarder of virtue or puni&s;her of vice? This is not to be ex|pected. We all love, and we ought to love our|&s;elves, and all wi&s;h to be happy. Why then &s;hould a man give up pre&s;ent ca&s;e and happine&s;s for &s;uf|fering and death, in the cau&s;e of virtue, if he has no expectation that God will reward virtue? This would be acting again&s;t the principle of &s;elf-love, which is generally too powerful to be counteracted</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="016800_0019_0F9E79D9E981FA00">
BUT &s;uppo&s;e a man to be habitually under the influence of this principle, that is, to believe and duly con&s;ider God, as his ruler and judge, who will hereafter reward virtue and puni&s;h vice with happine&s;s and mi&s;ery re&s;pectively, un&s;peak|ably greater than any to be enjoyed or &s;uffered in this world, and he may then upon rational principles and in con&s;i&s;tency with his &s;elf-love, forego the greate&s;t temporal good, and expo&s;e him&s;elf to the greate&s;t temporal evil, in the cau&s;e of virtue; and we may rea&s;onably expect that he will. Virtue will be his chief good: He will be attached to it, as to his very being, with all the &s;trength and ardor of his love and de&s;ire of happine&s;s. The fear of God therefore is the mo&s;t effectual, and the only &s;ure &s;upport of virtue in the world.</P>
<P>MEN inve&s;ted with civil power are not to be &s;ure le&s;s, but generally much more expo&s;ed to temptations to violate their duty than other men: They h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ve more frequent opportunities of committing injuries; and may do it with le&s;s fear of pre&s;ent puni&s;hment; and therefore &s;tand in need of every po&s;&s;ible re&s;traint to keep them from abu&s;ing their power, by deviating into the paths of vice.</P>
<P>IT is further to be con&s;idered, that the prac|tice of piety, which is compri&s;ed in the fear of God, has a powerful tendency to enoble and dignify the mind and beget in it an abhorrence of every thing mean and ba&s;e; to in&s;pire a mag|nanimity
<PB N="21" REF="016800_0020_0F9E79DA9F76FA38">
and fortitude of &s;pirit that will &s;up|port and carry it thro' the greate&s;t dangers and difficulties; to refine and purify the heart, to di&s;engage it from the vanities of the world, and beget that good will and benevolence which are the brighte&s;t part of a virtuous character. Con|templating daily the perfections of the Deity, as di&s;played in the creation, government and re|demption of the world, mu&s;t naturally tend to exalt the affections and fix them upon divine things, to make us love and de&s;ire to imitate the moral character of God; and con&s;equently to weaken the force of tho&s;e lu&s;ts which are &s;o apt to draw men a&s;ide and entice them into &s;in;&mdash;to enliven every principle of virtue, and make us perfect, even as our father in heaven is perfect.</P>
<P>IT is al&s;o to be ob&s;erved, that the human mind is liable to mi&s;take and err, that circum|&s;tances often occur, e&s;pecially to tho&s;e who are concerned in government, in which more wi&s;dom is nece&s;&s;ary than they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, even though they may be able men. In &s;uch ca&s;es we are directed to look up to God, the original and inexhau&s;tible &s;ource of wi&s;dom. Nor have we any rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that &s;uch applications will be in vain. God perfectly knows the hu|man mind, and all the ways in which its views and determinations can be influenced: And he may without infringing upon its moral liberty, by a powerful, though imperceptible operation, put it into &s;uch a train of thinking, as may give
<PB N="22" REF="016800_0021_0F9E79DD9F15E6A8">
it a ju&s;ter view, and lead it to a wi&s;er determi|nation, than it would otherwi&s;e have formed. There is, I apprehend, nothing in this &s;uppo&s;i|tion, incon&s;i&s;tent with the principles of rational theology and natural religion. Nor without &s;uppo&s;ing that God does thus interpo&s;e, is it ea|&s;y to conceive how that part of the divine government which is in the hands of civil rulers, &s;hould in all ca&s;es be adapted to the various cir|cum&s;tances of particular per&s;ons. But there is little rea&s;on to think that this light and direction will be granted to men who have no fear of God before their eyes; becau&s;e though they lack wi&s;dom, they will not a&s;k it of God, who giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not. And rulers being without this divine coun&s;el, it will not be &s;trange, if, merely for this rea&s;on, their conduct is wrong and ill-judged, calculated in many in&s;tances, not for the good, but the hurt of the people; and it may be, at a critical time, for their utter de&s;truction.</P>
<P>THERE can be no doubt, but God often brings di&s;tre&s;s and ruin upon a &s;inful people, through the ill-management of their rulers, given up to error and blindne&s;s. In the 19th chapter of I&s;aiah we have a prophe&s;y of the overthrow of the kingdom of Egypt. And the infatuation of their rulers is mentioned as one of the immediate cau&s;es of this calamity. "The &s;pirit of Egypt," &s;ays God, "&s;hall fail; and I will de&s;troy the coun&s;el thereof." It is afterwards added, "Surely the princes of Zoan are fools,
<PB N="23" REF="016800_0022_0F9E79DE77F68DA8">
the coun&s;el of the wi&s;e coun&s;ellors of Pharoah is become bruti&s;h." And in the 29th chapter of the &s;ame book, God threatens his own peo|ple, that for their hypocri&s;y and other wicked|ne&s;s, "the wi&s;dom of their wi&s;e men &s;hall peri&s;h. and the under&s;tanding of their prudent men &s;hall be hid." In the &s;ame way, is rea|&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, God often brings his judg|ments upon other nations. And therefore i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> a people de&s;ire to have rulers of wi&s;e and under|&s;tanding hearts, coun&s;elled and directed by hea|ven, they &s;hould take care, that they be men who fear God.</P>
<P>LET me ob&s;erve once more, that it is of great importance to their happine&s;s, that religion and virtue generally prevail among a people; and in order to this, government &s;hould u&s;e its in|fluence to promote them. Rulers &s;hould encou|rage them not only by their example, but by their authority; and the people &s;hould inve&s;t them with power to do this, &s;o far as is con|&s;i&s;tent with the &s;acred and unalienable rights of con&s;cience; which no man is &s;uppo&s;ed to give up&punc; or may lawfully give up, when he enters into &s;ociety. But re&s;erving the&s;e, the people may, and ought to give up every right and power, which will enable him more effectually to pro|mote the common good, without putting it in his power e&s;&s;entially to injure it. He ought therefore to have power to puni&s;h all open acts of profane&s;s and impiety, as tending by way of example to de&s;troy that reverence of God
<PB N="24" REF="016800_0023_0F9E79DF8C4FFE28">
which is the only effectual &s;upport of moral vir|tue; and all open acts of vice, as prejudicial to &s;ociety: He &s;hould have power to provide for the in&s;titution and &s;upport of the public wor&s;hip of God, and public teachers of religion and vir|tue, in order to maintain in the minds of the people that reverence of God, and that &s;en&s;e of moral obligation, without which there can be no confidence, no peace or happine&s;s in &s;ociety.</P>
<P>WITHOUT &s;uch care in government, there is danger that the people will forget the God that is above, and abandon them&s;elves to vice; or, to &s;ay the lea&s;t, impiety and vice are much le&s;s likely to become general, where &s;uch care is tak|en, than where it is not. And God having in the con&s;titution of nature made religion and vir|tue conducive, and even nece&s;&s;ary to the happi|ne&s;s of human &s;ociety, he has thereby plainly taught us, that it is the duty and bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;ociety as &s;uch, or of the civil magi&s;trate to do every thing to promote them, that may be done without injuring the rights of con&s;cience. And no man who has full liberty of inquiring and examining for him&s;elf, of openly publi&s;hing and profe&s;&s;ing his religious &s;entiments, and of wor|&s;hipping God in the time and manner which he choo&s;es, without being obliged to make any re|ligious profe&s;&s;ions, or attend any religious wor|&s;hip contrary to his &s;entiments, can ju&s;tly com|plain that his rights of con&s;cience are infringed. And &s;uch liberty and freedom every man may enjoy, tho' the government &s;hould require him
<PB N="25" REF="016800_0024_0F9E79DFE417F1C8">
to pay his proportion towards &s;upporting public teachers of religion and morality.</P>
<P>TAKING this care of religion appears to be &s;o plain and important a duty, that the govern|ment which &s;hould wholly neglect it, would not only act a very unwi&s;e and imprudent part with re&s;pect to them&s;elves; but be guilty of ba&s;e in|gratitude and a daring affront to heaven. By &s;uch conduct they would, as a community, in effect adopt the language of the profane fatali&s;ts mentioned by Job, who "&s;ay unto God, depart from us; for we de&s;ire not the knowledge of thy ways. What is the Almighty that we &s;hould &s;erve him! And what profit &s;hall we have if we pray unto him?" Now altho' it is po&s;&s;ible, that rulers who have no religion them&s;elves, may enact proper laws to &s;upport it among the people, yet it is to be remembered, that their example will have great influence, and, if that be irreligious and vicious, will, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, defeat the good effects of their authority, and do more to &s;pread corruption, than that will to prevent it. It is therefore highly proper in or|der to promote piety and good morals among the people, that rulers be men who fear God; who have a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of religion on their own minds, and conform to it in their lives.</P>
<P>IT may be proper to add, that though the fear of God may exi&s;t, where there is no know|ledge or belief of chri&s;tianity; yet that the &s;cheme of doctrines contained in the go&s;pel, is much
<PB N="26" REF="016800_0025_0F9E79E0A74354A0">
better calculated than any other known to the world, to produce and &s;trengthen that divine principle. The plan of redemption which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">olds for the fallen race of men, exhibits the Deity in the mo&s;t amiable light, as the perfection of love and benevolence: "The &s;olemn &s;cenes which it opens beyond the grave; the re&s;urrec|tion of the dead; the general judgment; the equa di&s;tribution of rewards and puni&s;hments to the good and bad; and the full completion of divine wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, in the final e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of order, perfection and happine&s;s," afford &s;uch motives to the love and reverence of God, and to the practice of all holine&s;s and vir|tue, as can be drawn from no other &s;cheme of religion: And therefore a belief of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t may ju&s;tly be con&s;idered, as an impor|tant qualification for a civil ruler.</P>
<P>I might ob&s;erve further under this particular, that impious, immoral men at the head of go|vernment, and having authority to appoint &s;ub|ordinate officers, will probably make choice of men of their own character, and in this way be a means of &s;preading corruption, and of much injury to &s;ociety: But I mu&s;t pa&s;s on to con&s;ider another qualification of rulers.

I mu&s;t now make &s;ome reflections upon the &s;ub|ject, and apply it to the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. And</P>
<P N="1">1. WHAT has been &s;aid of the nece&s;&s;ity of government for the peace and happine&s;s of man|kind, may lead us to reflect with &s;hame upon the &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and corruption of our &s;pecies, who, with all their rational and moral powers, can no otherwi&s;e be kept from injuring and de&s;troying one another, than by &s;uperior force, or the &s;ear of temporal &s;ufferings and puni&s;hment; and with whom you are no longer &s;afe, than it is un&s;afe for them to hurt you. This is a very humiliating con&s;ideration: And, &s;o far as we know, there is no other order of creatures thro' out the boundle&s;s univer&s;e, who, if left to their natural liberty, would be &s;o mi&s;chievous to one another as men.</P>
<P N="2">2. This may al&s;o lead us to reflect with plea|&s;ure and gratitude to God, upon the &s;teps which have been taken by this people to frame a new con&s;titution of government; and that a plan has been formed which appears in general &s;o well calculated to guard the rights and liberties, and promote the happine&s;s of &s;ociety; and which it is to be hoped will &s;oon be the foundation of our government, in&s;tead of that antiquated in|&s;ecure ba&s;is upon which it now re&s;ts.</P>
<P N="3">3. WE may likewi&s;e fee from what has been &s;aid, how much it is the duty and intere&s;t of a people to pay due &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the orders of
<PB N="35" REF="016800_0034_0F9E79E9B1D78D50">
government, and to endeavour unitedly to &s;up|port its authority. Both rulers and &s;ubjects are perhaps too apt to con&s;ider their re&s;pective in|tere&s;ts as di&s;tinct and &s;eparate: Whereas they are in truth one and the &s;ame,&mdash;the pro&s;perity and happine&s;s of the whole community. Every thing done by &s;ubjects in obedience to, and &s;up|port of, the ju&s;t authority of government is con|ducive to their own happine&s;s; and every thing done by governors, that is beneficial to the governed, is likewi&s;e &s;o to them&s;elves: And it is from the mutual endeavors of both to &s;erve each other, that the pro&s;perity of &s;ociety mu&s;t re&s;ult. If rulers abu&s;e their power, they may de&s;troy the happine&s;s of the community; but this may be done as effectually by the &s;ubjects re|fu&s;ing to obey and &s;upport the authority of government. Nor may any people expect to enjoy all the ble&s;&s;ings of &s;ociety, unle&s;s their go|vernment is pre&s;erved in due force and vigor.</P>
<P N="4">4. WE are reminded of the gratitude which we owe to God, that he has not permitted the natural and important right which every &s;ociety has of electing its own rulers to be wre&s;ted out of our hands, as is the ca&s;e in &s;ome other countries. Had Great-Britain carryed on, without oppo&s;iti|on, the mea&s;ures &s;he was pur&s;uing with us, we &s;hould probably in a little time have been wholly deprived of this privilege. She had already a&s;&s;u|med an ab&s;olute right of appointing too branches of the legi&s;lature. The&s;e would have had the appointment of all judicial and military officers:
<PB N="36" REF="016800_0035_0F9E79EA703B32D0">
And upon the &s;ame ground that &s;he robbed us of the election of a Governor formerly, and of Coun&s;ello<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s lately, &s;he might have annihilated the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives; or if &s;he had not done this in form, &s;he might by bribery and corruption, have rendered that hou&s;e a meer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ool to the &s;ervants of the crown, as is the ca&s;e in that country. It is therefore owing to the oppo&s;ition which his people made to the mea|&s;ures of the Briti&s;h court, and to the ble&s;&s;ing of God upon that oppo&s;ition, that they have now a voice in appointing their own rulers; other|wi&s;e our government might now have been in the hands of the weake&s;t and mo&s;t profligate favourites of that corrupt and infatuated cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P N="5">5. WE are reminded how much it is the duty and intere&s;t of a people, who are in the in|joyment of this right, to exerci&s;e it with pru|dence and integrity. The people's appointing their own rulers will be no &s;ecurity for their good government and happine&s;s, if they pay no regard to the character of the men they appoint. A dunce or a knave, a profligate or an avaricious worldling will not make a good magi&s;trate, be|cau&s;e he is elected by the people. To make this right of advantage to the community, due attention mu&s;t be paid to the abilities and moral character of the candidate. This is a con&s;ide|ration that concerns this people at large, as all have a voice in the election of our rulers, either per&s;onally, or by their repre&s;entatives. But upon this occa&s;ion it is proper to ob&s;erve, that it
<PB N="37" REF="016800_0036_0F9E79EB5A237B88">
e&s;pecially concerns the members of the honora|ble Council and hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives here pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">t, by whom the coun&s;ellors for the en&s;u|ing year are this day to be elected. And I &s;hall not, I hope, be tho't to go beyond my line of duty, if I &s;ay; that the electors ought not to give their votes at random, or from per&s;onal or pri|vate views. They act in this bu&s;ine&s;s in a pub|lic character, by virtue of power delegated to them by the people, to whom, as well as to God, the origin of all power, they are account|able for the u&s;e they make of it. Nor can they an&s;wer it to either, or even to their own con|&s;ciences, if thro' intere&s;ted or party views, they advance to the Council Board, men unqualified for the important duties of that &s;tation. At &s;uch a critical time as the pre&s;ent, the want of wi&s;dom or integrity in that hou&s;e may be attend|ed with the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences. The ad|vice of Jethro in the text, demands the con&s;ide|ration of all tho&s;e who are to bear a part in the elections of this day. "Provide out of all the people, able men, &s;uch as fear God, men of truth, hating coveteou&s;ne&s;s." There never was a time when &s;uch men were more nece&s;&s;ary at that board than the pre&s;ent. Nor would I en|tertain an opinion &s;o di&s;honorable to my coun|try, as to &s;uppo&s;e there are not &s;uch men in it; tho' I cannot at the &s;ame time entertain an idea &s;o flattering, as to &s;uppo&s;e there are not many among us who fall far &s;hort of this cha|racter. It belongs to the pre&s;ent electors to di&s;tingui&s;h, &s;o far as they can, the&s;e characters,
<PB N="38" REF="016800_0037_0F9E79EBE8B35B78">
one from the other, and to give their votes only for the former. Whoever con&s;iders the part which this Board has in legi&s;lation, their au|thority in directing the military and naval force of the &s;tate, their being inve&s;ted with the &s;upreme executive power, and in &s;ome impor|tant ca&s;es with a &s;upreme judicial power will be &s;en&s;ible that great wi&s;dom, integrity and forti|tude are nece&s;&s;ary for the right management of the&s;e powers. Should they be committed to men of &s;mall abilities and little knowledge; men unacquainted with the nature of govern|ment, and with the circum&s;tances of this &s;tate; men void of integrity, of narrow, contracted views, governed by ambition, avarice or &s;ome other &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ion; men of no fortitude and re|&s;olution, of da&s;tardly effeminate &s;pirits; &s;hould &s;uch men, I &s;ay, be intru&s;ted with the great and important powers ve&s;ted in the Council, what could be expected, but that their public conduct would bear the marks of their ignorance, weak|ne&s;s; effeminacy and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, to the great injury and di&s;honor, if not to the ruin of the common wealth. And tho' &s;uch men may be as fond of this &s;tation, as tho&s;e who are be&s;t qualified for it, and perhaps much fonder, yet it would be &s;o far from rendering them truly <HI>honourable,</HI> that it would only render them the more infamous, by bringing into public view their vices and defects; while the electors of &s;uch men, would fix an indelible &s;tain upon their own characters, and inherit the cur&s;es of the pre&s;ent and future generations.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="016800_0038_0F9E79ECE8550320">
BUT men who have them&s;elves been honored by the unbia&s;ed &s;uffrages of their country, mu&s;t &s;urely be too wi&s;e and virtuous, thus to pro&s;titute their votes; and it may, I hope, be taken for granted, that knowledge and integrity, the fear of God, and a public &s;pirit, will govern in the en&s;uing election, and &s;uch men be rai&s;ed to the Council Board as will do honor to that re&s;pectable &s;tation, to their electors and them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>I now beg leave, with all due defference and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, to &s;ugge&s;t a few things that may rea&s;onably be expected of a General Court, compo&s;ed of &s;uch men as the text de&s;cribes, by the people who have inve&s;ted them with this power and authority, And,</P>
<P>IT may be expected, that they will give due attention to the public affairs committed to their care. By accepting a &s;eat in either hou&s;e, a man does, implicitly at lea&s;t, &s;olemnly engage to at|tend to the bu&s;ine&s;s, which is there to be tran&s;|acted. Nor, do I &s;ee how he can with any propriety be called a man of truth, who after &s;uch engagement, neglects that bu&s;ine&s;s, for the &s;ake of going to his farm, his merchandi&s;e or his plea&s;ure. It appears to me, that &s;uch neg|lect argues great unfaithfulne&s;s in the delin|quents, and it may be attended with very per|nicious&punc; con&s;equences. Individuals may and often do plead in excu&s;e for this, that the bu&s;ine&s;s may be done without them: But they
<PB N="40" REF="016800_0039_0F9E79EE0BAD26A8">
ought to remember, that every one has an equal right to excu&s;e him&s;elf by this plea, and if all &s;hould do &s;o, the concerns of the public mu&s;t be wholly neglected. But,</P>
<P>IT may be ju&s;tly expected that our civil rulers will take due care to provide for the public defence. Notwith&s;tanding the great exertions we have al|ready made, and the great things which God has done for us, we mu&s;t &s;till contend with the enemies of our rights and liberties, or become their abject &s;laves. And it depends, in a great mea&s;ure, upon our public rulers under God, whe|ther we &s;hall contend with &s;ucce&s;s, or not. It is by their &s;ea&s;onable and prudent mea&s;ures that an army is to be provided and furni&s;hed with nece&s;&s;aries, to oppo&s;e the enemy. And it mu&s;t be the wi&s;h of every true American, that nothing may be omitted which can be done to &s;upport and render &s;ucce&s;sful &s;o important a cau&s;e: a cau&s;e &s;o ju&s;t in the &s;ight of God and man, which Heaven has &s;o remarkably owned, and all wi&s;e and good men approved; a cau&s;e which not only directly involves in it the rights and liber|ties of America; but in which the happine&s;s of mankind is &s;o nearly concerned: For in this exten&s;ive light I have always con&s;idered the cau&s;e in which we are contending. Should our ene|mies finally prevail, and e&s;tabli&s;h that ab&s;olute dominion over us, at which they aim, they would not only render us the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of all nations, but probably be able by the riches and forces of America to triumph over the arms of
<PB N="41" REF="016800_0040_0F9E79EE8307B220">
France and Spain, and carry their conque&s;ts to every corner of the globe; nor can we doubt, but that they would carry them, wherever there was wealth to tempt the enterprize: The noble &s;pirit of liberty which has ari&s;en in Ireland would be in&s;tantly cru&s;hed, and the brave men, who have appeared foremo&s;t in its &s;upport, be re|warded with an ax or a halter: The few advo|cates for this &s;uffering cau&s;e in Britain would be hunted and per&s;ecuted as enemies to govern|ment, and be obliged in de&s;pair to abandon her intere&s;t: And in every country where this event &s;hould be known, the friends of liberty would be di&s;heartened, and &s;eeing her in the power of her enemies, for&s;ake her, as the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t did their ma&s;ter. So that our being &s;ub|dued to the will of our enemies, might in its con&s;equences be the bani&s;hment of liberty from among mankind. The heaven-born virgin &s;ee|ing her votaries &s;lain, her altars o'er thrown, and her temples demoli&s;hed, and finding no &s;afe habitation on earth, would be obliged like the great patron of liberty, the fir&s;t-born of God, to a&s;cend to her God and our God, her Father and our Father, from whom &s;he was &s;ent to ble&s;s mankind, leaving an ungrateful world, after &s;he had like him, been "rejected and de&s;pi&s;ed of men," in &s;lavery and mi&s;ery, till with him &s;he &s;hall again de&s;cend to reign and triumph on earth. Such might be the con&s;equence, &s;hould the arms of Britain triumph over us. Whereas, if America pre&s;erves her freedom, &s;he will be an a&s;ylum for the oppre&s;&s;ed and per&s;ecuted of
<PB N="42" REF="016800_0041_0F9E79EF62CC89F0">
every country; her example and &s;ucce&s;s will encourage the friends, and rou&s;e a &s;pirit of liber|ty thro' other nations; and will probably be the means of freedom and happine&s;s to Ireland, and perhaps in time to Great-Britain and many other countries. So that our conte&s;t is not meerly for our own families, friends, and po&s;terity; but for the rights of humanity, for the civil and religious privileges of mankind. We have &s;urely then a right to expect, that the government of this &s;tate will neglect no mea&s;ure that is nece&s;&s;ary on their part, to aid &s;o intere&s;ting a cau&s;e, what|ever difficulties or expence may attend it. And, I hope, it may with equal confidence be expect|ed, that the people will chearfully lend their arms, and bear the expence that may be requi|red for &s;o glorious a purpo&s;e. Great expence mu&s;t without doubt be nece&s;&s;ary to carry on our defence: But whoever is di&s;po&s;ed on this account, to give up the di&s;pute, proves him&s;elf totally unworthy of the liberty for which we are contending.</P>
<P>As the &s;upport, or rather the recovery of the public credit, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to our hav|ing a re&s;pectable army in the field, as well as to our internal peace and pro&s;perity; it may be expected that this government will not be want|ing in any mea&s;ure for this purpo&s;e, which wi&s;|dom and &s;ound policy can &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>IF by means of the depreciation of our paper currency, and any law of this &s;tate, many per|&s;ons
<PB N="43" REF="016800_0042_0F9E79EF9F96DA60">
have &s;uffered, and are &s;till liable to &s;uffer great injury; if this inju&s;tice falls principally upon widows and fatherle&s;s children, and &s;uch others as are lea&s;t able to &s;upport them&s;elves un|der the lo&s;s&punc; this &s;urely is an evil that ought &s;peedily to be redre&s;&s;ed; and, if it be po&s;&s;ible, compen&s;ation &s;hould be made to the &s;ufferers, by tho&s;e who have grown rich by this iniquity. And as the General Court of the la&s;t year, did with great ju&s;tice make an allowance, for the depreciation of the currency, in fixing their own wages, and in &s;ome other in&s;tances, it may ju&s;tly be expected that the honourable Court of this year, will go on to extend this ju&s;tice to every part of the community, and order the &s;ame al|lowance to be made in di&s;charging all debts and contracts, however their private intere&s;t may be thereby affected.</P>
<P>THE large taxes now levying and to be levied, make it peculiarly proper that great care &s;hould be taken in fixing the proportion which the different parts of the community are re&s;pectively to pay; and we have a right to expect, that our honoured fathers who are to guard the rights of the whole, will not require any particular part to bear a greater proportion of this burden than is ju&s;t, con&s;idering its ability and circum&s;tances.</P>

The good education of children is a matter of great importance to the common-wealth. Youth is the time to plant the mind with the principles of virtue, truth and honor, the love of liberty and of their country; and to furni&s;h it with all u&s;eful knowledge. And tho' in this bu&s;ine&s;s much depends upon parents, guardians and ma&s;|ters, yet it is incumbent upon the government to make provi&s;ion for &s;chools, and all &s;uitable means of in&s;truction. Our College ju&s;tly claims the patronage and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;tate, in re|turn for the able men with which &s;he has fur|ni&s;hed the public; not to ob&s;erve, that her pre|&s;ent &s;uffering and low &s;tate renders her an ob|ject of pity: By the well known depreciation, &s;he, as well as many of her &s;ons in the mini&s;try, have lo&s;t a great part of their income; &s;he and they having in this re&s;pect, had the &s;ame hard lot with widows and orphans. Nor will I &s;up|po&s;e that we &s;hall ever have a General Court of &s;o little love to their country, or &s;o little &s;en&s;ible of the importance of literature to its virtue, liberty and happine&s;s, &s;o barbarous and &s;avage, as to &s;uffer her, or any of her family to langui&s;h in poverty, or to want what is nece&s;&s;ary to their making a decent and honorable appearance.</P>
<P>IF any thing can be done by government to di&s;courage prodigality and extravagance, vain and expen&s;ive amu&s;ements, and fanta&s;tic foppery, and to encourage the oppo&s;ite virtues. we may rea&s;onably hope it will not be neglected. The fondne&s;s of our countrymen, or, &s;hall I &s;ay,
<PB N="45" REF="016800_0044_0F9E79F284B79888">
country-women, for &s;howey and u&s;ele&s;s orna|ments and other articles of luxury, has been remarked by a gentleman in Europe, of great eminence for political wi&s;dom, as very unbe|coming our pre&s;ent circum&s;tances. This is a folly that bodes ill to the public; and it mu&s;t be the wi&s;h of every wi&s;e and good man, that it were laid a&s;ide. Men in authority, if they can do no more, may, at lea&s;t di&s;countenance it by their example; and this will not be without its good effect.</P>
<P>FINALLY, our political fathers will not fail, to do all they can, to promote religion and virtue through the community, as the &s;ure&s;t means of rendering their government ea&s;y and happy to them&s;elves and the people. For this purpo&s;e they will watch over their morals, with the &s;ame affectionate and tender care, that a pious and prudent parent watches over his children, and by all the methods which love to God and man can in&s;pire, and wi&s;dom point out, endeavor to check and &s;uppre&s;s all impiety and vice, and lead the people to the practice of that righteou&s;ne&s;s which exalteth a nation. If any new laws are wanting, or more care in the execution of laws already made, for di&s;couraging profane&s;s, intem|perance, lewdne&s;s, extravagant gaming, extor|tion, fraud, oppre&s;&s;ion or any other vice, they will take &s;peedy care to &s;upply this defect, and render them&s;elves a terror to evil doers, as well as an encouragement to &s;uch as do well. They will promote to places of tru&s;t, men of piety,
<PB N="46" REF="016800_0045_0F9E79F3826FA840">
truth and benevolence. Nor will they fail to exhibit in their own lives, a fair example of that piety and virtue, which they wi&s;h to &s;ee practi&s;ed by the people: They will &s;hew that they are not a&s;hamed of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, by paying a due regard to his &s;acred in&s;titutions, and to all the laws of his kingdom. Magi&s;trates may pro|bably do more in this way, than in any other, and perhaps more than any other order of men, to pre&s;erve or recover the morals of a people. The manners of a court are peculiarly catching, and, like the blood in the heart, quickly flow to the mo&s;t di&s;tant members of the body. If there|fore rulers de&s;ires to &s;ee religion and virtue flouri&s;h in the community over which they pre&s;ide, they mu&s;t countenance and encourage them by their own example. And to excite them to this,</P>
<P>I MUST not omit to ob&s;erve, that tho' the fear of God, a regard to truth and a hatred of covete|ou&s;ne&s;s, are nece&s;&s;ary to form the character of a good ruler, they are, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till more ne|ce&s;&s;ary to form the character of a good man, and &s;ecure the approbation of God, the Judge of all. For to him magi&s;trates in common with other men are accountable. Nor does he regard the per&s;ons of princes any more than of their &s;ubjects. If they are impious and vicious, if they abu&s;e their power, they may bring great mi&s;ery upon other men, but they will &s;urely bring much greater upon them&s;elves. The eye of heaven &s;urveys all their coun&s;els, de&s;igns and actions; and the day is coming, when the&s;e

&s;hall all be made manife&s;t, and every one receive according to his works. Happy they, who in that day &s;hall be found faithful, for they &s;hall lift up their heads with confidence, and amid&s;t ap|plauding angels enter into the joy of their Lord: While tho&s;e who have oppre&s;&s;ed and injured the people by their power, and corrupted them by their example, &s;hall be covered with &s;hame and confu&s;ion, and &s;entenced to that place of black|ne&s;s and darkne&s;s, where there is weeping, and wailing, and gna&s;hing of teeth!</P>
<P>LET me now conclude, by reminding this a&s;&s;embly in general, that it concerns us all to fear God, and to be men of truth hating covet|eou&s;ne&s;s. The low and declining &s;tate of reli|gion and virtue among us, is too obvious not to be &s;een, and of too threatening an a&s;pect not to be lamented by all the lovers of God and their country. Tho' our happine&s;s as a community, depends much upon the conduct of our rulers; yet it is not in the power of the be&s;t govern|ment to make an impious, profligate people happy. How well &s;oever our public affairs may be managed, we may undo our&s;elves by our vices. And it is from hence, I apprehend, that our greate&s;t danger ari&s;es. That &s;pirit of infide|lity, &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, luxury and di&s;&s;ipation, which &s;o deeply marks our pre&s;ent manners, is more for|midable than all the arms of our enemies.

&s;pirit, that temperance and frugality, which have entailed immortal honor on the memory of our renowed ance&s;tors; we might then, putting our tru&s;t in God, humbly hope that our public cala|mities would be &s;oon at an end, our independ|ence e&s;tabli&s;hed, our rights and liberties &s;ecured, and glory, peace and happine&s;s dwell in our land. Such happy effects to the public, might we expect from a general reformation.</P>
<P>BUT let every one remember, that whatever others may do, and however it may fare with our country, it &s;hall &s;urely be well with the righteous; and when all the mighty &s;tates and empires of this world &s;hall be di&s;&s;olved and pa&s;s away "like the ba&s;ele&s;s fabrick of a vi&s;ion", they &s;hall enter into the kingdom of their father which cannot be moved, and in the enjoyment and exerci&s;e of perfect peace, liberty and love, &s;hine forth as the &s;un forever and ever.</P>
