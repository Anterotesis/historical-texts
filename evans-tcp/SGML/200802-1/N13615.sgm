<P>THE attributes of Deity &s;hine gloriou&s;ly in all his works, in the whole frame of nature, in the cour&s;e of providence, and mo&s;t gloriou&s;ly of all in the wonders of redeeming love.&mdash;The living and true God is clearly di&s;played on every &s;ide, and we can turn our eyes or our attention no where, but we may behold him; the heavens declare his glory, and the firmament his handy work; the &s;un when "he goes forth as a bridegroom from his chamber, and rejoiceth as a &s;trong man to run his race;" "the moon walking in brightne&s;s;" the &s;tars in all their cour&s;es, the earth with all its vari|ous productions, "the great and wide &s;ea, in which are things innumerable both &s;mall and great:" All the&s;e di&s;play Jehovah's glory, and according to their various natures and &s;tations, bear te&s;timony for him, and prai&s;e his adored name. The language
<PB N="4" REF="017190_0003_0FA077DC0722C070">
of nature is univer&s;al and intelligible to all that have minds to under&s;tand, "there is no &s;peech nor language where their voice is not heard." And if we con&s;ider any particular creature in the great family of the Mo&s;t High (for he is parent of all) we may behold much of the power, wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of the Creator di&s;covered in that indivi|dual. Attend, for in&s;tance, to the formation of man, his very body, the mortal, the inferior part is "fearfully and wonderfully made, and curiou&s;ly wrought," it bears the natural image of Deity; and the &s;piritual, immortal part, the living &s;oul allied to angels, and the father of angels, di&s;covers yet more of the perfections of the univer&s;al parent, even his moral, as well as natural image, in its primeval &s;tate.</P>
<P>The human body is the well cho&s;en emblem which the great apo&s;tle keeps in his eye, in my text and context; and that with a view to illu&s;trate the importance of health, order and &s;ympathy, with due &s;ymmetry and &s;ubordination in the my&s;tic body of Chri&s;t, that is, his beloved church in the world; and no pa&s;&s;age of &s;acred &s;cripture would more na|turally lead into a proper di&s;cour&s;e on that &s;ubject: But as I mean now to &s;peak concerning the various duties of the body politic, from this text, my war|rant is a full parity of rea&s;on; the emblem in my text is ju&s;t as fitly adapted to the one ca&s;e as the other. Order and harmony, &s;ymmetry and due proportion, &s;ubordination, mutual care and affec|tion, in church and &s;tate, are equally nece&s;&s;ary for
<PB N="5" REF="017190_0004_0FA077DD52CD27F8">
the good of each, equally beautiful and beneficial; and if the&s;e are wanting in either, di&s;tempers will &s;eize on the body, pain will en&s;ue, much di&s;order will ari&s;e, and de&s;truction or di&s;&s;olution may be the fatal i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>Therefore, now beloved, favor me with your at|tention, while I &s;hall attempt to di&s;play the hap|pine&s;s of a &s;tate or nation, under the &s;imilitude of the human body in health and perfection, and the mi&s;ery of a commonwealth, from oppo&s;ite con&s;ide|rations.</P>
<P>How much of the divine wi&s;dom, power and goodne&s;s is &s;een in the formation of the human &s;tructure? How u&s;eful? How beautiful? How complete in every part? We de&s;ire not a member more than we have, and we are very aver&s;e to the lo&s;s of any one, though it be the lea&s;t. What &s;ym|metry and proportion do we ob&s;erve? What mu|tual harmony and &s;ympathy? What convenience in the location and office of every limb and every member? We could not be willing to have one organ, limb or member placed any where in the body but where it is; we could not be willing to have one more or one le&s;s than we have; we would by no means have any one of our members, organs of limbs take the place of any other pertaining to the human body. How loth &s;hould we be to have our head's placed in our brea&s;t's, or where our legs or feet are, or any where except where they are, above the body and all the members? How &s;ad &s;hould we think it to have our legs and arms change place with each other? Or to have our toes
<PB N="6" REF="017190_0005_0FA077DD87A5A058">
on our hands and our fingers on our feet: Or were we to walk on our heads, we &s;hould find our|&s;elves very mi&s;erable: Were our eyes and mouths placed on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of our heads, or in the body &s;omewhere below, we &s;hould be frightful mon&s;ters in our own view. We cannot think of the lea&s;t alteration in the number and &s;ituation of any of our members, but what would much di&s;plea&s;e us. God has formed and arranged the whole in his own infinite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, and all is right, perfectly right; and well might the great Creator &s;ay of his own work, as it came out of his own hands, <HI>All is very good.</HI></P>
<P>Every part, organ, limb and member of the hu|man body act in perfect union and concert, guided and actuated by the &s;ame &s;oul, the &s;ame will; all the parts a&s;&s;i&s;t one another in the performance of every action; all are fed by the &s;ame vital nouri&s;h|ment, have the &s;ame care one of another, and as the apo&s;tle in the context mo&s;t elegantly de&s;cribes it, "Whether one member &s;uffers all the members &s;uf|fer with it, or if one member be honored all the members rejoice with it." Every part of the hu|man body finds and feels the need of every other part; the hand can by no means &s;ay to the foot, or the foot to the hand, I have no need of thee; nor can the eyes, or mouth or ears &s;ay &s;o to any part of the body, or to any member of it, or any part, or member to them; every part of the body is far the more complete and happy for each particular part, and even the head needs the body and the members as much as they do the head.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="017190_0006_0FA077DE4963EE40">
Every part is ju&s;t where it &s;hould be, and is framed and adapted to the very office it ought to perform, and we &s;hould &s;hudder at the thought of any alteration in the number, office or &s;ituation of the re&s;pective members of the human &s;tructure; to loo&s;e an organ or a member, we ju&s;tly account a great lo&s;s, and to have one &s;uperadded would be al|together as di&s;agreeable to us; we would not loo&s;e an eye, perhaps, for the world, yet we &s;hould think it full as great an evil to have three eyes; the head we have, we cannot be willing to part with, but who of us would he willing to have two heads upon his &s;houlders? Two arms and two legs each of us want, but who would choo&s;e to have the number doubled? One mouth is a great ble&s;&s;ing, but more than one would turn a man into a mon&s;ter. Our number of ears we find exactly right; the fingers and toes we have are ju&s;t enough for us; our vital parts are ju&s;t &s;uch as we need, and they are placed within the body, ju&s;t where we would choo&s;e to have them; and the &s;ame nutriment, blood and &s;pirits, feed, &s;upply and move the whole; and of this our rea&s;on and choice highly approve.</P>
<P>We &s;ee a fitne&s;s and great propriety that the head and the body, every organ and every member, &s;hould attend to their own bu&s;ine&s;s, and do their own offices re&s;pectively, and not in the lea&s;t inter|fere with one another; but all keep their di&s;tinct places and functions. We choo&s;e the head &s;hould be above the body, and that four of the &s;en&s;es &s;hould have their &s;eat in it, we choo&s;e that our ears &s;hould hear and our eyes &s;ee; we choo&s;e to &s;mell with the
<PB N="8" REF="017190_0007_0FA077DF08B3B4F8">
no&s;e and ta&s;te with the mouth; we al&s;o highly ap|prove that the other &s;en&s;e, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that of feeling, &s;hould be diffu&s;ed through every part of the body, and &s;pread over the whole; and we &s;hould abhor that the &s;en&s;es &s;hould be confounded with one ano|ther, and intrude upon the peculiar offices of each other. What man is there that wi&s;hes to have his head and feet change places with each other? Or to have his brea&s;t and his back tran&s;po&s;ed? Who wi&s;hes to &s;ee with his ears, or hear with his eyes, or to ta&s;te with his no&s;e, and &s;mell with his mouth? Who would walk upon his hands, and with his feet handle the &s;word, the ax, or the reaper's &s;ickle? Or who would wi&s;h the &s;en&s;e of feeling confined to one part, and not &s;pread through the whole body? We find all is be&s;t as God has ordered; "what|&s;oever God doth, nothing can be added to it, nor any thing taken from it," but what would make it far le&s;s perfect than it is. If the human body be perfect in every part, and enjoy perfect health, no man, no angel, no creature can mend it; &s;o it is with the body politic, according to the divine con&s;titution, or the plain manife&s;tation of the di|vine wi&s;dom and will.</P>
<P>The infinitely wi&s;e and good Being has given us the &s;um and &s;ub&s;tance of the mo&s;t perfect form of civil government in his word, or, to keep up the &s;imile of the apo&s;tle, in my text and context, he has drawn out and formed a mo&s;t perfect <HI>political man.</HI></P>
<P>I mean that ancient plan of civil policy, deline|ated for the cho&s;en tribes of I&s;rael; there we find
<PB N="9" REF="017190_0008_0FA077DFC80C5168">
no king, no de&s;pot, no emperor, no tyrant, no per|petual dictator allowed of: We find the nation, by divine order, compo&s;ed of a number of &s;tates, that is to &s;ay thirteen, called the tribes of the children of I&s;rael.&mdash;Jacob had twelve &s;ons, but then you know the tribe of Jo&s;eph was &s;ubdivided and be|came two tribes, <HI>i. e.</HI> the tribe of Ephraim and the tribe of Mana&s;&s;eh, which made thirteen <HI>united, free and independent &s;tates:</HI> Each of the&s;e managed their internal police within them&s;elves; had each of them their legi&s;lative body, for their own &s;tate or tribe; al&s;o their judges, and courts of ju&s;tice&mdash;the&s;e offi|cers, whether legi&s;lative or executive, were called the elders of the tribes, and governed the particular tribe or &s;tate they were &s;et over; and were ap|pointed by the immediate voice of God, or were elective by the people, which is equally the voice of God, though in a different manner, for where God does not immediately indicate his will in &s;ome other way, then the voice of the people in ca&s;es of this nature, is <HI>the voice of God;</HI> and in the united &s;tates or tribes of I&s;rael, officers were elected by the people at large, or by tho&s;e to whom the people delegated power for that purpo&s;e, except when God him&s;elf immediately interpo&s;ed in a &s;pecial manner for their appointment; hence it was a well known maxim, that whom God and his people cho&s;e to rule, he &s;hould be received as ruler; and God always acknowledged the election of the peo|ple as his own appointment, when he did not other|wi&s;e interpo&s;e in the matter.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="017190_0009_0FA077E087326458">
Moreover, the&s;e Thirteen United States or tribes of I&s;rael, had by divine appointment a gene|ral congre&s;s, with a pre&s;ident at their head; Mo&s;es was the fir&s;t, Jo&s;hua &s;ucceeded him, &s;o on till the days of Samuel, when the con&s;titution was &s;ub|verted; by whom the whole nation were united and cemented in all things that were of general concern to the whole nation, and who gave advice and direction to the elders of the tribes, or general a&s;&s;emblies of the&s;e United States; I mean the Sanhedrim or &s;eventy elders, fir&s;t appointed in the wilderne&s;s, in the days of Mo&s;es; the&s;e compo&s;ed the great council of the nation, or <HI>General Congre&s;s;</HI> and thus all the States were united and con&s;olidat|ed in all their general and common concerns, and &s;o long as they abode firm in this rea&s;onable and divine con&s;titution, &s;upported it, and made the be&s;t of the happy privileges contained in it, they were in their civil policy as well as in their religi|on, far the happie&s;t nation under heaven.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In &s;upport of what I have &s;aid as to the antient Jewi&s;h form of government, before that people were cur&s;ed with de&s;poti&s;m, and its &s;imilarity, for &s;ub&s;tance to that of the&s;e united &s;tates&punc; &s;ee Exod. iii. 16.

<P>Here God has marked out that form of civil government which is agreeable to his own will, adapted to the nature and &s;tate of mankind which &s;e|cures the privileges of the &s;ubject, and affords all that liberty and equality which it is po&s;&s;ible mankind

<P>The great ruler of all worlds has hereby taught us that all power and privilege to make and di&s;|place rulers is, under him, lodged with the peo|ple; and that &s;ince the days of miraculous divine interpo&s;ition are ended, it is the right of the peo|ple to elect all their rulers, in every character,

either mediately or immediately, and to &s;et them a&s;ide whenever they cea&s;e to con&s;ult the public good and elect others in their &s;tead.</P>
<P>That rulers, in every department, are for the good of the people, are to act the part of kind parents to them, and that the people, though they have the power of appointing and removing rulers as they &s;ee fit, yet ought to obey and honor them, while they remain in their re&s;pective offices, as du|tiful and obedient children; and that every ruler, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, while in public office ought to do his own proper work and exe|cute his own proper office, with wi&s;dom, zeal and fidelity, and that every private per&s;on ought to abide in his own calling, and do the duties God has a&s;&s;igned him, and that <HI>rulers</HI> and <HI>ruled</HI> &s;hould all con&s;pire together as one, to promote the com|mon intere&s;t and be&s;t good of the whole, that there be no &s;chi&s;m in the body, but that the head and body, every organ and every member have a &s;en&s;e of their nece&s;&s;ity of, and dependence upon each other, and that all have the &s;ame care and mutual &s;ympathy which is found in the natural body&mdash;the&s;e principles, I &s;ay, are the plain dictates of the voice of the Mo&s;t High, not only as the rea&s;on he has given to man is his voice in every man, but al|&s;o in that ancient form of government which God him&s;elf marked out for that people, which he had cho&s;en to be his own peculiar people out of all the nations of the earth.</P>
<P>And as in the formation and &s;tructure of the hu|man body we ea&s;ily &s;ee the u&s;e, de&s;ign, and proper

bu&s;ine&s;s of each and every part, &s;o from that plan of civil order and government which God has point|ed out by the voice of rea&s;on and his own imme|diate voice from heaven, we may ea&s;ily &s;ee the of|fice and duty of every con&s;tituent part; and as the health of the body natural depends upon the pro|per functions union, and harmony of the parts, &s;o does that of the body politic; and as a &s;en&s;ible defect in any part of the natural body, or jarring and di&s;cord among the various parts of it, gives pain to the whole, brings on &s;ickne&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s, and ends in di&s;&s;olution, unle&s;s a cure is obtained, even &s;o it is in a community, a body of people, a &s;tate, or a nation.</P>
<P>The head that is placed on high above the body, no doubt points out the proper &s;tation of the le|gi&s;lative and ruling powers in a commonwealth: The &s;eat of thought, council and under&s;tanding is in the head, there the eyes are placed to &s;ee and the ears to hear; there all the &s;en&s;es but one have their &s;eat; the &s;en&s;orium is there, the memory is lodged there; the head is &s;ituated where it may have the be&s;t pro&s;pect of all things, its bu&s;ine&s;s is to &s;tudy, invent, compare, judge and direct what is be&s;t for the whole man; the head in its own &s;itu|ation, and with all its organs and &s;en&s;es, is well a|dapted for its own bu&s;ine&s;s; but how unfit a thing is it to walk upon in&s;tead of a foot, or to u&s;e in the place of an arm or a leg? If the head is clear and well, the brain and all the organs of it in good order, and a good under&s;tanding &s;eated there, it will do its own proper office, to think, &s;ee, hear,
<PB N="14" REF="017190_0013_0FA077E387490D20">
&s;peak and direct, which the whole body and all the members be&s;ide could not in any wi&s;e do: So the bu&s;ine&s;s of civil guides is a di&s;tinct bu&s;ine&s;s, which they are to attend to, and when the right per&s;ons, qualified per&s;ons are in that &s;tation, they have a work to do, and will wi&s;ely and kindly perform an important work, as di&s;tinct from that of a private per&s;on as the bu&s;ine&s;s of the head is from that of one of the fingers.&mdash;A good political head is as e&s;&s;ential to the happine&s;s of the body po|litic, as a good natural head is to the body natural, and the &s;tation of each ought to be e&s;teemed equally honorable in relation to the body.</P>
<P>The natural ear, &s;ituate in the head, receives in|telligence, the natural eye &s;ees dangers, &s;pies out the way in which the feet are to walk and the whole body have its cour&s;e and motion, &s;earches out the work of the members, directs them in their re&s;pective employments, and &s;ees, or &s;hould &s;ee, that all is well done; or if any thing is done ami&s;s, reviews and points out proper amendments which the body and members perform.&mdash;And this is the end and de&s;ign for which God has appointed civil rulers, or a political head to every commonwealth; they are to watch for, and collect all intelligence; they are able and nece&s;&s;ary to guide and conduct, &s;ecure and guard the body; they are to &s;earch and point out the way in which the body politic is to walk and move, with proper employment for the hands and feet and every part, that every branch may be harmoniou&s;ly employed and engaged for the good of the whole; &s;hould always maintain
<PB N="15" REF="017190_0014_0FA077E447305CD0">
and exerci&s;e the &s;ame kind, whole&s;ome, directive authority over the body politic, and every part of it, which the natural head does over the body na|tural.&mdash;If the head &s;hould undertake to do the office of any other part, it would make mi&s;erable work of it, and become a plague to the whole body; even the little finger will do its own work better than the head can do the work of that finger; the head, though a mo&s;t noble and honorable part of the man, is good for nothing in any other &s;ta|tion or bu&s;ine&s;s but its own. I would not hereby in&s;inuate that civil rulers are not fit to do the du|ties of private members of the commonwealth, were they in private capacity; doubtle&s;s tho&s;e who are good public guides, would do very well in any character of life, were they placed in other &s;tation than that in which they are; al&s;o there are many men in private character that would make excellent civil guides, were they put in that &s;tation; all I mean is to &s;hew the utter confu&s;ion that mu&s;t en|&s;ue when rulers depart from their &s;tation and cha|racter, neglect their own bu&s;ine&s;s, and de&s;cend to that which is allotted to others; or when people in any other character and &s;tation, depart from the duties of their &s;tation; and take upon them the bu&s;ine&s;s of rulers; this is like changing the place of the head and the feet, it is "turning things up|&s;ide down and mu&s;t be e&s;teemed as the potter's clay."</P>
<P>The arms and hands of the natural body are a very natural emblem of the executive powers in the commonwealth, both civil and military. It is true the &s;ame per&s;on may &s;u&s;tain &s;everal capacities, and
<PB N="16" REF="017190_0015_0FA077E50ACCC928">

The arms and hands are prin|cipal parts that effect and put in execution what is directed by the head, &s;o all armies, and executive courts, and mini&s;ters of ju&s;tice, with officers under their command, ought always religiou&s;ly and con&s;ci|entiou&s;ly to obey the &s;upreme council of the nation or &s;tate. Our arms and hands would be wor&s;e to us than nothing, if they would exert their &s;trength without, or contrary to the direction of the mind, or coun&s;el of the head; no life would be &s;afe in our hands, no not even our own; &s;o all the courts of ju&s;tice, and all military powers mu&s;t do as they are directed by the &s;upreme power, they mu&s;t have law, direction and warrant, from the whole people, given out by the proper mouth of the people; which, as in the body natural, &s;o in the body po|litic, can never be found any where but in the head.&mdash;The under&s;tanding or head is good to di|rect, and the arms and hands are good to execute, they are &s;trong, and active, and wonderfully nece&s;|&s;ary and beneficial, under &s;uch direction: but &s;et the arms to hear and &s;ee and direct, and the head to &s;trike the blow for the execution, and what then would ever come to pa&s;s? The head can do no work but its own and the arms and hands none

but theirs; and as it is a great ble&s;&s;ing to have a clear, di&s;cerning, judicious head, &s;o it is to have &s;trong arms; a good legi&s;lative and a good exe|cutive power are equally nece&s;&s;ary, and each an ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ing to a commonwealth, and God him&s;elf hath appointed both for the good of the body.</P>
<P>The vital parts in the human body mo&s;t na|turally allude to that which is common to the whole nation or commonwealth, as the&s;e are of general and common concern to the head and body, every member, every ve&s;&s;el, nerve, and fibre in the human frame; and as the vitals are well or ill, &s;o is the whole man: The head, the body and every part are very &s;en&s;ibly affected by the &s;tate which the vital parts are in. The&s;e therefore &s;tand in the &s;imilitude for the general principles, or prevailing &s;pirit which is in the body politic, and by which a nation as &s;uch move and conduct them&s;elves; &s;o in days of old when rulers were very wicked as to the greater part of them, and the &s;pirit and prin|ciples of the nation were very corrupt, the mo&s;t tells them, "the whole head is &s;ick and the whole heart faint." True religion and good morals deeply fixed in the &s;ouls of men and generally prevailing in a nation, communicate that health, &s;trength, and vigor to every part, which make the political man active and honorable, powerful and happy, "righteou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a nation." If the vital parts are all well the ca&s;e is happy in the na|tural body; if the heart with all the adjacent parts are right, and all the blood and &s;pirits that pa&s;s
<PB N="18" REF="017190_0017_0FA077E71C9C8DF0">
through the heart are good, the favor is great to that man; but if the vitals are much di&s;ea&s;ed, the whole ma&s;s of blood and animal &s;pirits will be much infected thereby, and that inward di&s;order will &s;oon be communicated to every part, and not the remote&s;t member, not one nerve or fibre, not one gland or ve&s;&s;el in the whole &s;y&s;tem will long remain free from the awful contagion: Ju&s;t &s;o it is in a nation;&mdash;if true religion and good moral principles prevail and rule, that nation is in health, and never fails of attend|ant honor, &s;trength and glory; but if religion dies away, morality decays, infidelity, vice and iniquity prevails among the people in general, &s;uch a na|tion is in a &s;ickly &s;tate, is greatly di&s;honored, greatly weakened, and unle&s;s a cure is obtained, the di&s;temper mu&s;t fir&s;t or la&s;t prove fatal. "Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no phy&s;ician there? Why then is not the health of the daugh|ter of my people recovered?" It is very ea&s;y to &s;ee that it is e&s;pecially incumbent on that order of men who are in&s;tructors in righteou&s;ne&s;s, and who &s;hould continually attend to the great things of re|ligion, the health of the &s;oul, and the morals of mankind, to act that part in the man politic, for the health of the body in this world and the world to come, which a &s;ound heart and well regulated vital parts do in the body na|tural; that by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, without which they can do nothing, &s;uch &s;piritual and moral health and &s;trength may be diffu&s;ed through the whole community as that &s;trength and
<PB N="19" REF="017190_0018_0FA077E7479E8FC0">
glory, honour and ble&s;&s;ing may re&s;t upon the whole nation and dwell in it forever.</P>
<P>That order of men which in the body eccle&s;ia&s;|tic are, under Chri&s;t, in the place both of the head and the vital parts, do in the civil community take only the place of the latter, and their proper place they mu&s;t be careful to keep; their work is exceed|ingly important and beneficial to a community, when by the ble&s;&s;ing of Almighty God on their labours, they are made in&s;trumental of turning a people from their &s;ins to the living and true God, from their vices, iniquities and immoralities to a life of religion, to the practice of holine&s;s and virtue; for whenever a nation is happy, firm and &s;table and the times are ble&s;&s;ed times, then "righte|ou&s;ne&s;s and holine&s;s are the &s;tability of their times and the &s;trength of their &s;alvation."</P>
<P>And this order of men, as well as all others mu&s;t keep their own place, and attend their own important and &s;pecial duties, the heart and the vital parts can do the body no &s;ervice, in any place but where they be; place the heart where the head is, and the head where the heart is, and the man would not &s;urvive the exchange; or remove any of the vital parts and join them on the foot, and they would be of le&s;s &s;ervice than the toes, which indeed are proper and u&s;eful there. The inward parts are very precious to us, where they are, and for their proper functions; our life and all our natural comforts mu&s;t depend on the good order of the&s;e; but even the heart, the mo&s;t precious part of all, is good for nothing to us, but only in
<PB N="20" REF="017190_0019_0FA077E8098DE858">
the place where it is, and for tho&s;e very purpo&s;es for which it was made.&mdash;The body of man in ge|neral, and tho&s;e &s;trong and &s;tately pillars which &s;upport the body, by means of which we walk or run, and which are as nece&s;&s;ary to compleat the man as the head, the heart, the arms, or any other part of the human &s;tructure; this body and the&s;e noble pillars, I &s;ay, with every adjoining part, de|note the body of the people of which a nation is compo&s;ed; they have union and connection with the whole; they have one common &s;ympathy with the head, the arms, and the vital parts; they are nou|ri&s;hed, &s;upplied and kept in vigor, by that &s;ame nutriment, of which the head partakes, and by which it is nouri&s;hed: Thus the indu&s;trious body of the people in a nation, by diligence and oecono|my in their various callings, are the grand &s;upport and &s;trength of the whole, and while they are well engaged, each one in his proper work, well united in virtue and good order, in love to the commu|nity, in a &s;pirit of harmony and quietne&s;s, in fru|gality, indu&s;try and temperance, in patience and fortitude and in a becoming regard and affection to the whole, they are altogether as nece&s;&s;ary to the head and the heart, as the latter are to them; neither can the eye &s;ay to the hand, nor the head to the feet, I have no need of you: If the people in general are not engaged to promote the &s;trength and honor, wealth and happine&s;s of a nation, if they do not uphold rulers and teachers, courts of ju&s;tice and the military power, all mu&s;t fall to the ground; the&s;e are the &s;trong and noble pillars on

which, under God, the whole civil fabric &s;tands, and without tho&s;e all the efforts of rulers and offi|cers, in every department, mu&s;t become empty and ineffectual as a vi&s;ion of the night.&mdash;And it is of great importance that the&s;e keep their proper place, as well as every other order of men; it is altogether as mon&s;trous to &s;ee the legs where the arms &s;hould be, as the arms where the legs &s;hould be; it is as great an evil to have the feet growing on the head as the head growing on one of the feet: As the people mainly &s;upport and uphold the whole, and as all rulers and teachers are for their good and though in &s;tations of honor, are indeed to &s;erve the people, &s;o there is no &s;cruple but that it is the right of the people to elect and re|move their civil rulers as they find mo&s;t for the good of the commonwealth; but, &s;o long as ru|lers being made the head by the free choice of the people, are continued &s;o by the &s;ame choice, then for people in general to a&s;&s;ume the province of their rulers and civil guides, is exceedingly wrong. For people in general to turn guides and coun&s;el|lors, and refu&s;e to be guided and coun&s;elled by ru|lers, to &s;ay what ought, and what ought not to be done, in the highe&s;t and mo&s;t important concerns of the &s;tate, of which, indeed, mo&s;t people are ut|terly ignorant, is ju&s;t as if a madman &s;hould endea|vor to pluck his eyes from his head, and place them in &s;ockets made in his feet for that purpo&s;e, or wi&s;h his ears grafted on either leg, and the &s;en&s;es which are &s;eated in the head removed to the lower

parts of his body. The common people are no better, out of their place, than tho&s;e I have &s;poken of before and in their proper place no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary and important.</P>
<P>The thoughts now &s;ugge&s;ted may lead us to &s;ome reflections exceeding proper for the inhabitants of the&s;e United States in the pre&s;ent day. I am in|deed happy in &s;peaking, at this time, to an audi|ence very well affected to the common important cau&s;e we are engaged in, an audience that have a &s;en&s;e of the importance of unanimity, harmony and good order through the whole; yet even &s;uch a people can never have the&s;e good principles too deeply fixed in their minds; and from what has been &s;aid we learn the great wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of the Mo&s;t High, in forming the political as well as the natural man; each according to the plain direction of his will, is alike perfect in every part, and in every member; and harmony, concord, unanimity, and mutual &s;ympathy are alike nece&s;&s;a|ry in each, that health, &s;trength and happine&s;s may prevail and abound through the body. What a wretched thing would the human body be, if the head and vitals, limbs, organs and members were alternately to change their places, and a&s;&s;ume the offices of each other? If the head &s;hould &s;ay I will be one of the feet, and will exerci&s;e my&s;elf in walking, if the vital parts &s;hould &s;ay we will be the fingers and toes, and they &s;hall come within the body and take our place, if the eyes &s;hould &s;ay we will no longer &s;ee but hear, and the ears &s;hould &s;ay we will leave off hearing and try how well we

can &s;ee, if the arms &s;hould &s;ay to the legs, come let us change places and the legs &s;hould reply we will gladly take your place; we are tired of walking and running and &s;upporting the body, we will henceforth handle the ax, the &s;cythe, the &s;ickle, the &s;word and the pen of the writer. In &s;uch a ca&s;e what would the man be good for? Would he not be the mo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s frightful mon&s;ter in the univer&s;e!</P>
<P>Ju&s;t &s;o in the political man, the commonwealth, the head and every member mu&s;t keep their re|&s;pective places or it becomes a hideous and a horrid mon&s;ter; the legi&s;lature mu&s;t do their own bu&s;ine&s;s and none mu&s;t interfere with them; the executive authority mu&s;t do theirs without in|terruption; the military mu&s;t act their own part, and every officer and &s;oldier keep his own place and &s;tation; they that are &s;et to in&s;truct in the great things of religion, to promote virtue, and to mend the morals of men, mu&s;t al&s;o attend to their own proper work, and then, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, the body, the whole civil man, the &s;tate, the commonwealth may expect health, &s;trength, vigor and glory.</P>
<P>Let me tell you, my dear audience, that we of this nation have now for &s;ub&s;tance, that very &s;ame plan of government, which infinite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s pointed out to the cho&s;en the much be|loved tribes of I&s;rael, in the con&s;titution of which we &s;ee a political man perfect, or how the commu|nity ought to be organized and regulated, as clear|ly as we &s;ee in the formation of the human body,
<PB N="24" REF="017190_0023_0FA077EB08259A10">
what is mo&s;t convenient, fit and perfect for &s;uch a creature as man. We have our Sanhedrim, <HI>i. e.</HI> our General Congre&s;s, an&s;wering for &s;ub&s;tance to the &s;eventy elders of I&s;rael that were over all the tribes as their &s;upreme council; we have our di&s;|tinct &s;tates as they had their di&s;tinct tribes, and it is really worthy of notice that our number &s;hould be exactly the &s;ame, even in the fir&s;t e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of our independency. Thus, "when the Mo&s;t High divided to this nation their inheri|tance, and &s;eperated us from all the other &s;ons of Adam, he &s;et the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of I&s;rael," we have a General A&s;&s;embly, in each of our States, the &s;ame, for &s;ub&s;tance, with the elders of each tribe or &s;tate in I&s;rael of old: We have our courts, judges, and teachers formed on the &s;ame general plan, varying only in a few circum&s;tances, which ought always to be the ca&s;e, as times and the exi|gencies of States and nations are altered: We have the &s;ame rule to walk by which they had, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the perfect word of God, but in this we have much the advantage of them, the &s;cripture canon is now compleat, which then it was not, and we have the divine light abundantly clearer than they had; we have the &s;ame church, but with privileges much enlarged, the &s;ame ordinances but is a milder form, we are "grafted into that old, good olive tree, and partake of all the fatne&s;s of it;" and even in a ci|vil and political view, we are the compleate&s;t man, the be&s;t regulated commonwealth that ever the wi&s;|dom and goodne&s;s of God formed, except that I have
<PB N="25" REF="017190_0024_0FA077EBC91516A8">
been &s;peaking of, and with that we are, for &s;ub&s;tance, the &s;ame.&mdash;And now, all we want for the mo&s;t con&s;ummate happine&s;s a nation can enjoy on this &s;ide heaven, is that the head, the vitals, the arms and hands, the body and every member be in good health, each keep their proper place, and every one do its own duty, and that no part impede, or inter|fere with any other: Every part has one common intere&s;t, we are all partakers of the &s;ame nouri&s;h|ment, and, to keep up the &s;imile, the &s;ame blood and &s;pirit are common to every part, and, Oh! may we find one common &s;oul, and that a religi|ous, holy and virtuous one, actuating and animat|ing the whole, that rulers, teachers, and people may be one for God, and for the happine&s;s of this nation, that all the wheels in church and &s;tate, in the army and navy, and in every department throughout the nation may be in&s;pired and harmo|niou&s;ly turned like the glorious combination in the vi&s;ion of the prophet, the whole machine moved together in the mo&s;t glorious order. "When tho&s;e went the&s;e went, and when tho&s;e &s;tood the&s;e &s;tood, and when tho&s;e were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over again&s;t them, for the &s;pirit of the living creature was in the wheels." Con&s;ult the fir&s;t chapter of Ezekiel's prophecy at large. Thus a commonwealth &s;hould be as a living creature, every part acting in concert, and all actuated by the &s;ame living &s;oul. Though the offices and &s;tations are various, yet the happi|ne&s;s or &s;uffering is common; there is as much pain in the head or the heart, as in any of the mem|bers;
<PB N="26" REF="017190_0025_0FA077EC89183B58">
high &s;tations do not make men happy, but that man that does his duty well, whatever be his &s;tation, is a happy man: If the head or heart have &s;ometimes more plea&s;ure than the limbs, yet at o|ther times their pain as much exceeds, and when I hear any of the common people murmuring again&s;t rulers, and manife&s;ting bitter envy again&s;t them, as though &s;uch had peculiar happine&s;s not common to the body in general, and as though they, <HI>the common people,</HI> were excluded the privileges and happine&s;s of the great, I look upon it ju&s;t as tho' the foot &s;hould &s;ay, "becau&s;e I am not the hand I am not of the body." And that per&s;on, whatever &s;tation he is in, who has not a tender concern for the whole, and a &s;ympathy with the whole, is a pu|trid part or member, utterly pa&s;t feeling, and calls for immediate amputation.</P>
<P>All per&s;ons that are unwilling to keep their re|&s;pective &s;tations, and do their re&s;pective duty, all incendiaries, all tories and traitors, all that hold il|licit corre&s;pondence with the common enemy, all that have any di&s;po&s;ition to throw them&s;elves and this favored nation into the arms of tyranny and de&s;poti&s;m, all mal-contents that would &s;tir up re|bellion, anarchy, and confu&s;ion in the bowels of it, or in any part, all that do not rejoice in the common good and mourn in the common calamity, all extortioners and &s;elfi&s;h wretches that would en|rich them&s;elves, though at the expence of the ruin of the nation, all &s;uch, I &s;ay, are the very excre|ment of the body politic, or they are well compar|ed to a gangrene, or to baneful putrefaction which
<PB N="27" REF="017190_0026_0FA077ED48C0C0D0">
calls for the in&s;truments of inci&s;ion, that it may be di&s;|charged; or to any nau&s;eous infection which mu&s;t be purged out, or di&s;temper that mu&s;t be &s;ubdued, before per|fect health can return, or de&s;ired &s;trength and vigor be recovered.</P>
<P>We learn moreover, how exceeding thankful we ought to be for the happy and divine con&s;titution God has favor|ed us with, and how dreadfully wicked it is to murmur and complain about it. God can make the head, the vitals the body, and every member better than they are if he plea&s;es, and let us all cry to him continually, to give more wi&s;dom and grace to the whole; but a better form or model of government, a better plan we never can have.&mdash;When a man is &s;ick and in pain, he does not complain that God has made him a man, nor does he want the Almighty &s;hould unmake him; no, he wants that every di&s;ordered part &s;hould be brought into good order; he would by all means be a man &s;till, but a man in good health: Even &s;o, let none of this nation de&s;ire any other, than that this mo&s;t perfect political man may be in good health in every part. Since the fall, there mu&s;t needs be troubles and the marks of the cur&s;e in all bodies, whether natural, eccle&s;ia&s;tical, or political; but let none wi&s;h for the annihilation of that which is the mo&s;t perfect in its kind, that can ever be ex|pected in this very imperfect &s;tate of things. If we have pain in our heads or vitals, or any other part, we do not want tho&s;e parts de&s;troyed but cured; and for this end we u&s;e all means, and for this we pray to that God in whom we live. When I hear any per&s;on &s;ay, our political head is liable to err, and has made mi&s;takes, and therefore I wi&s;h it was di&s;&s;olved and that we had no &s;uch council to guide us, I look upon it as great a &s;pecimen of folly, as if I &s;hould hear a man &s;ay, "my head is in pain and therefore I wi&s;h it was cut off." Whenever there be di&s;order in the body na|tural, eccle&s;ia&s;tical or civil, we &s;hould &s;eek a cure by fervent prayer and by all proper means, and not the di&s;&s;olution of the body: And as it is in God the natural body doth "live, and move and have its being," ju&s;t &s;o is it with the body
<PB N="28" REF="017190_0027_0FA077EE07742460">
politic; in the former, if one part is di&s;ordered, the re&s;t do not hate it and feel a bitterne&s;s towards it; but &s;ympa|thize with it and contribute all they can to its healing and comfort; even &s;o in the latter, we &s;hould all &s;ympathize together, maintain a common feeling, and where&s;oever the defect or failure is, every other part &s;hould "be watchful and &s;trengthen the things that remain that are ready to die."&mdash;How &s;oon would the human body die, if when a dangerous di&s;order has &s;eized one part, the other parts would act as though they hated that &s;ickly part, and would lend no kind a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to &s;upport, comfort, or heal it? Even &s;o it is in the ca&s;e I have been &s;peaking of; if there be not mutual care, &s;ympathy and kind a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in every part, di&s;&s;olu|tion and death mu&s;t be the awful con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Oh! may every ruler and every &s;ubject throughout the&s;e United States, have a deep, influential &s;en&s;e of all the&s;e things! may each one keep his proper place and do his proper duty, with wi&s;dom, firmne&s;s, and vigor, and with an heart &s;incere in the &s;ight of God: It is the glory and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of man, whatever be his &s;tation, to &s;erve God and his generation faithfully, according to the divine will.</P>
<P>And finally, there can be nothing more obvious from what has been &s;aid, than the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity we, and our whole nation &s;tand in, of the powerful and effectual vi&s;ita|tions of the divine &s;pirit, in every part of the land; this, my dear friends, and nothing &s;hort of this will &s;et us right as to our di&s;po&s;itions and vital principles of action; this would make us love our God &s;upremely, and then we &s;hould "love one another with a pure heart fervently." This would make us Chri&s;tians indeed, and then we &s;hall be patriots of real con&s;equence:&mdash;Oh! then for this let us pray day and night, for this let us cry aloud and not &s;pare, in this let rulers and &s;ubjects, mini&s;ters and people all unite as the mo&s;t important favor on which all our happine&s;s de|pends; for this let us all pray and not faint, "until the righteou&s;ne&s;s of our nation go forth as brightne&s;s, and the &s;alvation thereof as a lamp that burneth."</P>
